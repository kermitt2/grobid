If this package includes CMap files, they contain their own copyright
notices and distribution conditions.  All other files in the package
are Copyright 2002 Glyph & Cog, LLC, and are licensed under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), version 2 or 3.

This package provides support files needed to use the Xpdf tools with
Hebrew PDF files.

Contents:
- ISO-8859-8 encoding
- Windows-1255 encoding

Place all of these files in a directory, typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/share/xpdf/hebrew
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\xpdf\hebrew

Add the contents of the "add-to-xpdfrc" file to your system-wide
xpdfrc config file, which is typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\xpdf\xpdfrc

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can add these lines to your
personal xpdfrc file in $HOME/.xpdfrc.

Make sure to edit the added lines to use the actual directory where
the files were installed.
