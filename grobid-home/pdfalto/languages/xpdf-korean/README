If this package includes CMap files, they contain their own copyright
notices and distribution conditions.  All other files in the package
are Copyright 2002-2005 Glyph & Cog, LLC, and are licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or 3.

This package provides support files needed to use the Xpdf tools with
Korean PDF files.

Contents:
- Adobe-Korea1 character collection support
- Adobe-KR character collection support
- ISO-2022-KR encoding

Place all of these files in a directory, typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/share/xpdf/korean
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\xpdf\korean

Add the contents of the "add-to-xpdfrc" file to your system-wide
xpdfrc config file, which is typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\Xpdf\xpdfrc

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can add these lines to your
personal xpdfrc file in $HOME/.xpdfrc.

Make sure to edit the added lines to use the actual directory where
the files were installed.

To display PDF files that refer to non-embedded Korean fonts, you will
need to install a Korean font.  Free TrueType/OpenType fonts are
available:

    ftp://ftp.mizi.com/pub/baekmuk/baekmuk-ttf-2.1.tar.gz
    https://www.google.com/get/noto/

After installing a Korean font, add appropriate "fontFileCC"
lines to your xpdfrc file (see the sample in "add-to-xpdfrc").
