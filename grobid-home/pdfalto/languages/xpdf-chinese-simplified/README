If this package includes CMap files, they contain their own copyright
notices and distribution conditions.  All other files in the package
are Copyright 2002-2004 Glyph & Cog, LLC, and are licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or 3.

This package provides support files needed to use the Xpdf tools with
Chinese (Simplified) PDF files.

Contents:
- Adobe-GB1 character collection support
- ISO-2022-CN encoding
- EUC-CN encoding
- GBK encoding

Place all of these files in a directory, typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/share/xpdf/chinese-simplified
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\xpdf\chinese-simplified

Add the contents of the "add-to-xpdfrc" file to your system-wide
xpdfrc config file, which is typically:

    Unix - /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
    Win32 - C:\Program Files\xpdf\xpdfrc

Alternatively, on Unix systems you can add these lines to your
personal xpdfrc file in $HOME/.xpdfrc.

Make sure to edit the added lines to use the actual directory where
the files were installed.

To display PDF files that refer to non-embedded Chinese fonts, you
will need to install a Chinese font.  Free TrueType/OpenType fonts are
available:

    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/non-gnu/chinese-fonts-truetype/gkai00mp.ttf.gz
    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/non-gnu/chinese-fonts-truetype/gbsn00lp.ttf.gz
    https://www.google.com/get/noto/

After installing a Chinese font, add an appropriate "fontFileCC" line
to your xpdfrc file (see the sample in "add-to-xpdfrc").
