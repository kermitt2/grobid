	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Ocular parameters have been applied to ophthalmic lens designs in order to satisfy individ-<lb/>ual wearers. An axial length (AL) of them can be used in individual ophthalmic lens designs.<lb/> Our aim was to propose a reliable formula that predicts an individual&apos;s AL using the corneal<lb/> radius and refractive error, and to demonstrate the applicability of this formula. A total of 348<lb/> subjects underwent keratometry, objective and subjective refraction, and AL measurement.<lb/> The formula of calculated AL for prediction obtained from the original Gullstrand simplified<lb/> schematic eye: calculated AL = (24.00 × aveK/7.80)-(SE × 0.40), where aveK and SE<lb/> denote average corneal radius and spherical equivalent, respectively. Calculated AL was<lb/> 24.50 ± 1.83 mm, which was 0.18 ± 0.47 mm longer than the measured value of 24.32 ±<lb/> 1.73 mm (p &lt; 0.001). The proportion showing the differences between the calculated and<lb/> measured ALs were 284 eyes (40.8%) for 0.00-0.25 mm, 525 eyes (75.4%) for less than<lb/> 0.50 mm, 665 eyes (95.5%) for less than 1.00 mm, and 31 eyes (4.5%) for more than 1.01<lb/> mm. Correlation coefficient showed a very high correlation between calculated and mea-<lb/>sured ALs (r = 0.967, p &lt; 0.001), and higher in the myopic than in the hyperopic group. The<lb/> mean difference was 0.18 mm; the 95% limit of agreement was +1.10--0.75 mm in all<lb/> groups. Agreement was better in hyperopic eyes than myopic eyes. Prediction from calcula-<lb/>tion of AL with a formula using the corneal radius and SE provides an alternative method to<lb/> direct measurements of AL, especially in the restricted environment, which can&apos;t use biomet-<lb/>ric equipment for personalized ophthalmic lens design.<lb/></div>
