Set of files:
------------

After running Grobid on a set of PDF files using methods for creating training data, each article comes with at least:
- the PDF used to generate the training data, for instance toto.pdf
- a pre-annotated file for the header segments: toto.header.tei.xml
- the list of tokens considered for the header and the associated features: toto.header - this file can be ignored to a large extend, but is necessary for training Grobid.

In addition, depending on the metadata available in the article's header, the following training files are also produced:
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed affiliation and address recognition: toto.affiliation.tei.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed authors recognition: toto.authors.tei.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed reference segment analysis: toto.header-references.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed date analysis: toto.date.xml

Example of existing annotations can be found under grobid-trainer/resources/dataset/header/corpus.

The tagset used for the encoding of the training data is as follow.


Headers
-------

For headers (training files *.header.tei.xml), we try to follow the TEI and we use the following tags: 

- <titlePart> for title (included in a <docTitle> element)
- <docAuthor> for the complete sequence of authors. The content of this tag will be subsequently parsed by the header "name" model 
- <affiliation> for the complete affiliation field. The content of this tag together with the content of the address tag will be subsequently parsed by the "affiliation-address" model. 
- <address> for the complete address field. The content of this tag together with the content of the affiliation tag will be subsequently parsed by the "affiliation-address" model. 
- <div type="abstract"> for the abstract block
- <div type="introduction"> for the start of the introduction section (i.e. just after the header ends). 
(note that you may see in the older part of the corpus, alternatives such as <div type="intro"> or even <introduction>, which are supported but not standard) 
- <keywords> for the keyword field (including possibly the word Keywords:), an additional attribute can give some more information about the type of keywords (PACS, or classes for ACM)
- <email>, for encoding the email address
- <phone>, for encoding the contact phone number
- <ptr> for web url corresponding to the processed document (e.g. where the document is available online). Other web address might appear in the header (for instance in a copyright section), but they won't be specifically encoded as web url.
- <date type="publication"> is the publication date, which is similar to the default case <date>
For non publication date, the date can be further specified with an attribute, this is valid for the submission date <date type="submission">.  The content of this field will be further parsed by the "date" model.
- <reference>: this is to annotate the reference information about the current article present in its header. The content of this field will be further parsed by the "citation" model.
- <idno> for the article-specific identifier, in particular DOI
- <note type="other"> covers by default any other textual material, but the attribute type="" is used for the following cases: 
	- <note type="copyright"> for the copyright info - if copyright-char is not recognized correctly by OCR-software, use the Unicode character code &#169; .
	- <note type="submission"> for the information about the submission of the document. If a date is present in the submission field, it is recommended to encode it as <date type="submission">, however Grobid currently does not distinguish this sort of date and process this date as it would be tagged with <note type="submission">. 
	- <note type="dedication"> for information about the dedication of the publication. 
	- <note type="page">, for the page number
	- <note type="english_title">, in the case that the main title is not in English, the English title might appear as a secondary title. It is encoded as a specific note with the indicated attribute.
Note that information such as web address, email, etc appearing in these note fields must not be encoded as such, but are part of the note.	
	
- <lb/> for line breaks
- <pb/> for page breaks


Affiliation and address
-----------------------

* For the affiliation+address annotations (training files *.affiliation.tei.xml), see the document guidelines-affiliation_address.pdf

Affiliation markers are annotated with the tag <marker>
Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of the standard elements (<orgName>, <addrLine>, <settlement>, <region>, <postCode>, <country>, <postBox>, <marker>) can be left untagged out of these elements, within the <author> block.


Dates
-----

For dates (training files *.date.tei.xml), we do not follow the TEI but a basic XML format based on <day>, <month> and <year> elements. Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of these elements ((punctuations, etc.) can be left untagged within the <date> elements.

Example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dates>
	<date>Received <month>August</month> <day>17</day>, <year>2005</year></date>
</dates>


Author names
------------

For author names (training files *.authors.tei.xml), we use relatively standard tags (<forename>, <middlename>, <surname>, <roleName>, <suffix>). affiliation markers are very common to indicate to which institution belongs a give author and is encoded with the tag <marker>
Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of these elements (punctuations, syntactic sugar, etc.) has to be be left untagged under the <author> elements.

Example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tei xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

Reference
---------

For references (bibliographical citation typically present in the bibliographical section at the end of an article), we use the following tags:
- <author> for the complete sequence of authors
- <title level="a"> for article title and chapter title. Here "a" stands for analytics (a part of a monograph).
- <title level="j"> for journal title.
- <title level="m"> for non journal bibliographical item holding the cited article. Note if a book is cited, the title of the book is annotated with <title level="m">. If a thesis is cited, the title of the thesis is annotated with <title level="m">, and the type of thesis as <note>. Here "m" stands for monograph.
- <date> the date sequence (including parenthesis, etc.)
- <biblScope type="pp"> the full range of pages
- <biblScope type="vol"> the block for volume (e.g. <volume> vol. 7,</volume>)
- <biblScope type="issue"> the block for the issue, also known as number, (e.g. no. <issue>3</issue>,)
- <tech> the king of technical report/thesis information
- <orgName>: the institution for thesis or technical reports
- <publisher>
- <pubPlace> publication place, or location of the "publishing" institution
- <editor> for all the sequence of editors
- <ptr> for web url
- <idno> for the document-specific identifier, in particular DOI
- <note> -> any indications related to the reference and not covered by one of the previous tags.

Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of these elements (punctuations, syntactic sugar, etc.) has to be be left untagged under the <bibl> elements.
