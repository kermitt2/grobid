        <acknowledgment>The notion of the third-sector, with which <individual>Michael Dunford</individual> closes his discussion of Lipietz, is crucial to a truly millennial discourse and practice. It is one that has been central in the approach to urban and social development that we put forward in this journal. Can the third sector release the imagination and the vision to which governments, or their current advisers, seem blind? Can the Dome become an icon of what we can, in the new century, leave behind? Meanwhile, William Gibson's bridge, discussed below by <individual>Richard Skeates</individual>, and the now demolished Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, present images for the liberated zones, related movements and sympathetic governments-local, regional and national -of the future.</acknowledgment>
