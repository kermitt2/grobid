			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Hadronic decays of the τ lepton are very important for studying QCD phe-<lb/>nomena at a low-energy scale. Various decay modes including an η-meson <lb/>represent a wide class of such decays, which are still poorly studied. One of <lb/>the important tasks in this field is to test effective chiral theories [1,2,3,4]. The <lb/>τ decay amplitudes in these theories are based on an effective Lagrangian of <lb/>pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector mesons with U(3) L × U(3) R symmetry. <lb/>On the other hand, for some decays the branching fractions as well as spec-<lb/>tral functions of the final states can be predicted using the vector dominance <lb/>model (VDM). Another important issue is testing the relations between the <lb/>cross section of e + e − → π + π − η and the spectral function in τ − → π − π 0 ην τ <lb/>decay predicted by conservation of vector current (CVC) and isospin sym-<lb/>metry [5]. For all of the above tasks, precise measurements of the branching <lb/>fractions as well as detailed studies of the final-state invariant mass distribu-<lb/>tions are highly desirable. <lb/></body>

			<body>Three τ -decay modes involving η mesons, τ − → K − ην τ <lb/>1 , τ − → K * (892) − ην τ , <lb/>and τ − → π − π 0 ην τ , have been studied by CLEO [6,7,8] and ALEPH [9]. <lb/>However, the experimental statistics were very limited. For example, CLEO <lb/>has the most precise measurements with 85 events in the τ − → K − ην τ mode, <lb/>125 events in the τ − → π − π 0 ην τ mode and 25 in the τ − → K * − ην τ mode. <lb/>The limited statistics of these measurements result in large uncertainties for <lb/>the branching fractions and do not allow study of the hadronic mass spectra. <lb/>We report a detailed study of the branching fractions for τ − → K − ην τ , <lb/>K − π 0 ην τ , π − π 0 ην τ , as well as π − K 0 <lb/>S ην τ decays. The K − π 0 invariant mass <lb/>in the K − π 0 ην τ decay and the π − K 0 <lb/>S invariant mass in the π − K 0 <lb/>S ην τ decay <lb/>are studied to evaluate the branching fraction of the τ − → K * (892) − ην τ decay. <lb/>In addition, some other final-state invariant mass distributions are presented <lb/>and discussed. <lb/>This study was performed at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider [10] <lb/>with the Belle detector. The results are based on a 490 fb −1 data sample that <lb/>contains about 450 million τ -pairs, which is almost 100 times larger than in <lb/>any of the previous measurements. <lb/>The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the Belle de-<lb/>tector. Event selection is explained in Section 3. The branching fractions are <lb/>determined in Section 4, where that of τ − → K * (892) − ην τ is evaluated from <lb/>analysis of the τ − → K − π 0 ην τ and π − K 0 <lb/>S ην τ samples in Section 4.3. Finally, <lb/>some concluding remarks are given in Section 5. <lb/>2 Experimental apparatus and Monte-Carlo simulation <lb/>The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists <lb/>of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an <lb/>array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrange-<lb/>ment of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic <lb/>calorimeter (ECL) comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a supercon-<lb/>ducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return <lb/>located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 <lb/>L mesons and to identify <lb/>muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [11]. Two inner <lb/>detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm radius beam pipe and a 3-layer <lb/>silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 140 fb −1 , while a 1.5 <lb/>cm radius beam pipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift <lb/>chamber were used to record the remaining 350 fb −1 [12]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Particle identification (PID) of the charged tracks uses likelihood ratios, P x , <lb/>for a charged particle of species x (x = µ, e, K, π or p). P x is defined as <lb/>P x = L x /Σ y L y (the sum runs over the relevant particle species), where L x <lb/>is a likelihood based on the energy deposit and shower shape in the ECL, <lb/>the momentum and dE/dX measured in the CDC, the particle range in the <lb/>KLM, the light yield in the ACC, and the particle&apos;s time-of-flight from the <lb/>TOF counter [13]. The efficiencies for kaon, muon and electron identification <lb/>are 77% for momenta of p &gt; 0.3 GeV/c, 92% for p &gt; 1.0 GeV/c and 94% for <lb/>p &gt; 0.5 GeV/c, respectively. <lb/>The detection efficiency for each signal mode and the level of background (BG) <lb/>contribution are estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To generate <lb/>signal events as well as τ -decay backgrounds, the KKMC program [14] is used. <lb/>For the decay modes not covered by KKMC, like τ − → K − ην τ , K * (892) − ην τ , <lb/>. . ., the signal MC is produced assuming a pure phase-space distribution of the <lb/>hadronic system with a V −A weak interaction. The background from e + e − → <lb/>q q (q q continuum) is simulated using the EvtGen procedure [15]. The detector <lb/>response is simulated by a GEANT3 [16] based program. Throughout the <lb/>paper the efficiencies quoted include the branching ratios of the corresponding <lb/>η decays. <lb/>3 Event Selections <lb/>The signal events should have the following common features in the e + e − → <lb/>τ − <lb/>signal τ + <lb/>tag reaction: <lb/>τ − <lb/>signal → X − + η + n(≤ 1)γ + (missing), <lb/>τ + <lb/>tag → (µ/e) + + n(≤ 1)γ + (missing), <lb/>where X − denotes K − , K − π 0 , π − π 0 , π − K 0 <lb/>S or K * (892) − systems. The π 0 , <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S and K * (892) − are reconstructed through π 0 → γγ, K 0 <lb/>S → π + π − , and <lb/>K * (892) − → K 0 <lb/>S π − , K − π 0 decays, respectively. The η meson is identified <lb/>through the η → γγ decay mode for all τ channels while the η → π + π − π 0 <lb/>mode is added for the τ − → K − ην decay mode. <lb/>The signal events, therefore, comprise either two or four charged tracks with <lb/>zero net charge and two or four γ&apos;s. In order to take into account initial-state <lb/>radiation, we allow at most one extra γ on both the signal and tag sides. Each <lb/>charged track is required to have a transverse momentum p t &gt; 0.1 GeV/c, and <lb/>a polar angle of −0.866 &lt; cos θ &lt; 0.956, where p t and θ are measured relative <lb/>to the direction opposite to that of the incident e + beam in the laboratory <lb/>frame. Each photon candidate should have an energy E γ &gt; 0.05 GeV within <lb/>the same polar angle region as for the charged particles. <lb/></body>

			<body>The tag-side τ tag is required to decay into leptons, i.e. τ + → ℓ + ν ℓ ντ (ℓ = <lb/>e/µ), which corresponds to a branching fraction of 35.2% [17]. The lepton <lb/>candidates are required to be well identified by requirements on the P e or P µ <lb/>PID parameters with p &gt; 0.7 GeV/c. <lb/>The thrust axis (n thrust ) is defined to maximize V thrust = Σ i |p CM <lb/>i •n thrust |/Σ i |p CM <lb/>i |, <lb/>where p CM <lb/>i <lb/>denotes the momentum of each particle in the center-of-mass sys-<lb/>tem (CM), and the sum runs over all detected particles in an event. The <lb/>requirement V thrust &gt; 0.8 is applied to remove q q events. An event is divided <lb/>into two hemispheres by the plane perpendicular to n thrust . The hemisphere <lb/>that includes τ signal with an η is referred to as the signal side, while the opposite <lb/>hemisphere, which includes τ tag , is defined as the tag side. <lb/>In order to remove non-τ pair backgrounds, such as the qq continuum, the <lb/>total energy in CM is required to be in the range 3.0 GeV &lt; E CM <lb/>total &lt; 10.0 <lb/>GeV. In addition, the invariant masses of both the signal and the tag sides are <lb/>required to be smaller than the τ -mass: M sig , M tag &lt; m τ (1.78 GeV/c 2 ). To <lb/>remove two-photon backgrounds, the missing momentum should correspond to <lb/>a particle crossing the fiducial region; we require that the missing momentum <lb/>satisfy −0.866 &lt; cos θ(p miss ) &lt; 0.956. After applying these requirements, the <lb/>q q background level is 3% of the signal yield. Background from two-photon <lb/>reactions is negligible. <lb/>To reconstruct an η, two γ&apos;s with E γ &gt; 0.2 GeV are required in the barrel <lb/>region (−0.624 &lt; cos θ &lt; 0.833). In addition, we allow combinations with <lb/>at most one extra γ with 0.05 &lt; E γ &lt; 0.2 GeV in the endcap region on <lb/>the signal side to take into account initial-state radiation as well as beam-<lb/>induced BG clusters in the calorimeter. In order to reduce the number of <lb/>incorrect combinations with a γ from π 0 decay (denoted hereafter as γ π 0 ), the <lb/>η-candidate γ (γ η ) should not form a π 0 mass with any other γ, i.e., a π 0 -veto <lb/>is applied. The π 0 mass window is defined in this paper as 0.105 GeV/c 2 &lt; <lb/>M γγ &lt; 0.165 GeV/c 2 , which is a ±3σ range of the detector resolution. <lb/>3.1 τ − → K − ην τ decay <lb/>Candidate events for this decay mode must contain one charged track and at <lb/>least two γ&apos;s in the η → γγ case, or three charged tracks and two γ&apos;s in the <lb/>η → π + π − π 0 (π 0 → γγ) case. <lb/>A kaon is identified by the P K parameter with p &gt; 0.3 GeV/c. In addition, <lb/>a low P e value is required to remove beam electrons from two-photon pro-<lb/>cesses; this requirement reduces two-photon BG to a negligible level. The <lb/>opening angle between the K − and η is required to satisfy the condition <lb/>cos θ(P CM <lb/>K ; P CM <lb/>η ) &gt; 0.8, to reduce the combinatorial BG. In addition, the <lb/></body>

The dashed line shows the threshold of this <lb/>selection. <lb/>3.2 τ − → K − π 0 ην τ and π − π 0 ην τ decays <lb/>For these decays, an η is reconstructed through the γγ mode only, so that the <lb/>signal event should contain one charged track and four γ&apos;s on the signal side. <lb/>All γ&apos;s, except for a possible extra γ, are required to be detected in the <lb/>barrel region of the calorimeter, and two of them should form a combina-<lb/>tion consistent the π 0 mass. The total momentum on the signal side is re-<lb/>quired to satisfy p CM <lb/>sig &gt; 2.5 GeV/c. A condition on the opening angle be-<lb/>tween the missing momentum in the CM and the thrust axis is imposed: <lb/>cos θ(p CM <lb/>miss ; n sig <lb/>thrust ) &lt; −0.6, to remove BG&apos;s with large missing momentum on <lb/>the signal side. Charged kaons and pions are selected by requiring large P K <lb/>and small P e in the K − π 0 ην τ mode, while small P K and small P e are selected <lb/>in the π − π 0 ην τ mode. <lb/>For further background rejection, we construct a likelihood using the following <lb/>seven variables: V thrust , momenta of the η and π 0 in the CM (p CM <lb/>η , p CM <lb/>π 0 ), the <lb/>missing-mass squared (M 2 <lb/>miss ), the energy of the γ η &apos;s in the CM (E CM <lb/>γη ), p CM <lb/>sig , <lb/>and cos θ(p CM <lb/>K/π ; p CM <lb/>η ). The MC simulation is used to study the likelihood dis-<lb/>tributions of generic τ + τ − and the small residual q q BG (L BG ) as well as the <lb/>signal (L sig ). A likelihood ratio is defined as R = L sig /(L sig + L BG ). The R <lb/>distribution is shown in Figs. 2 (a) for K − π 0 ην τ and (b) for π − π 0 ην τ decay; <lb/>with the requirement R &gt; 0.6, about half of the background is removed, while <lb/>93% and 90% of the signal samples are retained, respectively. <lb/>The resulting M γγ distributions are shown in Figs.3 (a) and (b) for the K − π 0 ην τ <lb/>and π − π 0 ην τ modes, respectively.

Fits are performed with a Crystal Ball (CB) <lb/>function [18] plus a second-order polynomial function to represent the η con-<lb/>tribution and combinatorial BG, respectively. All five parameters of the CB <lb/>function, as well as three others for BG are treated as free parameters in the <lb/>fit. <lb/>The results of the fit are shown by the solid curve in the corresponding fig-<lb/>ures. The best fits give η masses of M η = 0.5449 ± 0.0006, 0.5444 ± 0.0010 <lb/>and 0.5443 ± 0.0004 GeV/c 2 for K − ην τ , K − π 0 ην τ , and π − π 0 ην τ decays, re-<lb/>spectively, in the η → γγ subsample, while M η = 0.5474 ± 0.0007 GeV/c 2 for <lb/>K − ην τ in the η → π + π − π 0 subsample. The corresponding mass resolutions are <lb/>σ Mη = 0.0110 ± 0.0006, 0.0107 ± 0.0015, 0.0116 ± 0.0003, and 0.0075 ± 0.0004 <lb/>GeV/c 2 , respectively. These values of M η and σ Mη are in good agreement with <lb/>those obtained from the MC simulation, although the obtained masses are <lb/>shifted by 2 -3 σ from the η mass in Ref. [17], which is due to the incomplete <lb/>detector calibration. For instance, M MC <lb/>η <lb/>= 0.5442, 0.5450, 0.5464, and 0.5473 <lb/>GeV/c 2 for a generated mass of m η = 0.54745 GeV/c 2 . <lb/>The η yields obtained from the fits are N η = 1, 387 ± 43, 270 ± 33, and <lb/>5, 959±105 events for the K − ην τ , K − π 0 ην τ , and π − π 0 ην τ modes, respectively, <lb/>in the η → γγ case, while N η = 241 ± 21 events for the K − ην τ decay in the <lb/>η → π + π − π 0 case. These yields include BG, attributed to other τ decays with <lb/>η meson(s), such as the τ − → π − π 0 π 0 ην τ and π − π + π − ην τ ; q q continuum with <lb/>η meson(s); cross-feeds among the signal modes. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.1.2 Background <lb/>The possible backgrounds in the K − ην τ , K − π 0 ην τ and π − π 0 ην τ decay modes <lb/>include (a) feed-across from signal modes and (b) other processes such as <lb/>τ → π − π 0 π 0 ην τ , K − ηην τ , π − ηην τ , π − ην τ and q q. We first discuss the second <lb/>source. <lb/>BG from generic τ + τ − decays is evaluated using a MC simulation where the <lb/>value of B(τ − → π − π 0 π 0 ην τ ) is taken from Ref. [19]. This BG is negligible for <lb/>K − ην τ and K − π 0 ην τ decays, and is only 72 ± 20 events, which is smaller than <lb/>the statistical uncertainty in the η yield for the π − π 0 ην τ decay. <lb/>To examine the τ − → K − ηην τ and π − ηην τ contaminations, we analyze data <lb/>using selection criteria similar to those used for the K − π 0 ην τ and π − π 0 ην τ <lb/>modes. An additional η, instead of a π 0 , is reconstructed, and no selection on <lb/>the likelihood ratio is implemented. Requiring one photon pair to be in the η <lb/>mass region, 0.48GeV/c 2 &lt; M (1) <lb/>γγ &lt; 0.58 GeV/c 2 , which includes the largest <lb/>energy γ, the invariant mass distribution of the other η candidate, (M (2) <lb/>γγ ), is <lb/>shown in Figure 4. The evaluated η yields are 1.4 +2.6 <lb/>−1.9 and 4.4 ± 6.8 events <lb/>in the K − ηην τ and π − ηην τ decays, respectively, with detection efficiencies of <lb/>ǫ = 0.19% and 0.22%, respectively. We then set the upper limits [20] <lb/>B(τ − → K − ηην τ ) &lt; 3.0 × 10 −6 <lb/>(1) <lb/>and <lb/>B(τ − → π − ηην τ ) &lt; 7.4 × 10 −6 <lb/>(2) <lb/>at the 90% confidence level (CL) including systematic uncertainties of 6.9% <lb/>and 7.1%, respectively. Since the cross feed probability for these modes with <lb/>extra η&apos;s is below 3%, their contamination is ignored. <lb/>The τ − → π − ην τ decay proceeds via a second-class current so that its branch-<lb/>ing fraction is expected to be small, as low as 10 −5 [3] or less. Since the <lb/>efficiency for detecting π − ην τ as signal is of the order of 10 −4 , the total con-<lb/>tamination is then ∼ 10 −9 or less so that this decay can be ignored. <lb/>BG from the q q continuum is examined using both MC and data in order to <lb/>take into account the η production uncertainty of the q q MC. A q q enriched <lb/>sample is produced with some variations of the signal selection criteria. We <lb/>require M tag &gt; m τ , while the requirement M sig &lt; m τ is not applied; the PID <lb/>requirement on the tag side is reversed. Other criteria are not changed. A <lb/>comparison between the resulting η yields of MC and the data resulted in <lb/>the following MC scale factors: 2.3 ± 0.7 for K − ην τ , 2.6 ± 0.5 for K − π 0 ην τ , <lb/>and 2.9 ± 0.3 for π − π 0 ην τ . Therefore, we obtain rescaled q q contaminations of <lb/>39.7 ± 15.8 events in K − ην τ , 212 ± 29 events in π − π 0 ην τ and 27.0 ± 8.5 events <lb/></body>

The uncertainties in the <lb/>luminosity evaluation and σ(e + e − → τ + τ − ) are 0.3% and 1.4%, respectively. <lb/>The value of B(K 0 <lb/>S → π + π − ) used in MC has a 0.4% error [17].

Therefore we combine the two <lb/>results and obtain <lb/>B(τ − → K * (892) − ην τ ) <lb/>= (1.34 ± 0.12 ± 0.09) × 10 −4 . <lb/>(14) <lb/>5 Result <lb/>Using a high statistics 450 million τ -pair data sample from Belle, we have <lb/>obtained the following branching fractions for five different decay modes: <lb/>B(τ − → K − ην τ ) = (1.58 ± 0.05 ± 0.09) × 10 −4 , <lb/>B(τ − → π − π 0 ην τ ) = (1.35 ± 0.03 ± 0.07) × 10 −3 , <lb/>B(τ − → K − π 0 ην τ ) = (4.6 ± 1.1 ± 0.4) × 10 −5 , <lb/>B(τ − → π − K 0 <lb/>S ην τ ) = (4.4 ± 0.7 ± 0.3) × 10 −5 , <lb/>B(τ − → K * (892) − ην τ ) = (1.34 ± 0.12 ± 0.09) × 10 −4 , <lb/>where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. <lb/>We also set the upper limits on the following decay modes at the 90% CL: <lb/>B(τ − → K − K 0 <lb/>S ην τ ) &lt; 4.5 × 10 −6 , <lb/></body>

It is clearly seen that the preci-<lb/>sion of the measured values has been considerably improved. <lb/>It is also noteworthy that the central values of our branching fractions are <lb/>in all modes lower than those of the other experiments [6,7,8,9]. This fact <lb/>can be mostly attributed to the underestimation of the BG contamination in <lb/>previous low statistics measurements. For instance, the q q BG estimation in <lb/>the previous analyses relied on the MC. However, this analysis evaluates the <lb/>BG rate using a q q enriched data sample. Furthermore, Ref. [7] ignored the <lb/>K − π 0 ην τ BG contribution, since they estimated it as ∼ 0.1% BG, based on a <lb/>theoretical calculation that predicted its branching fraction to be 8.8 × 10 −6 <lb/>[3]. However, its rate is about 1% of the signal in our measurement, and its <lb/>branching fraction is about five times as large. Our high statistics allows us to <lb/>reliably and precisely scrutinize various BG contributions, while the previous <lb/>measurements, which had low statistics, did not have sufficient sensitivity to <lb/>notice, or correctly judge, the BG contamination. <lb/>Our results are compared with different theoretical calculations in Table 4. The <lb/>branching fraction for τ − → π − π 0 ην τ decay can be predicted by the isospin <lb/>symmetry (CVC) using the experimental results on e + e − → π + π − η [5,22]. <lb/>Our branching fraction agrees with the predictions, B(τ − → π − π 0 ην τ ) = <lb/>(1.3 ± 0.2) × 10 −3 [5] and 1.5 × 10 −3 [22]. <lb/>Pich [3], Braaten [23], Li [4] and Aubrecht [24] calculated the branching frac-<lb/>tions of various τ decays involving η meson(s), based on chiral perturbation <lb/>theory, as listed in Table 4. Their results are in fair agreement with our mea-<lb/>surements, particularly taking into account possible uncertainties in theoreti-<lb/>cal predictions. Further detailed studies of the physical dynamics in τ decays <lb/>with η mesons are required. <lb/>It should be mentioned that the TAUOLA MC program [14] qualitatively <lb/>reproduces our hadronic mass distributions in τ − → π − π 0 ην, τ − → K − ην <lb/>and τ − → K * (892) − ην decays, as shown in Fig. 7. Further analysis of the <lb/>spectra including various phenomenological models is in progress. <lb/></body>
