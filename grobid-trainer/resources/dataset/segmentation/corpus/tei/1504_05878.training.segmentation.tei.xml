			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Studies of the process B ∓ → D K ∓ , where D indicates a neu-<lb/>tral charmed meson reconstructed in a state accessible to both <lb/>D 0 and D 0 decays, give sensitivity to the unitarity triangle an-<lb/>gle γ ≡ arg(−V ud V * <lb/>ub /V cd V * <lb/>cb ) (also denoted φ 3 ). Improved knowl-<lb/>edge of γ is necessary for testing the Standard Model descrip-<lb/>tion of CP violation. In a recent publication [1] it was shown <lb/>how inclusive three-body self-conjugate D meson decays can be <lb/>used for this purpose, provided their fractional CP-even content <lb/>is known, a quantity denoted F + (or F <lb/>f <lb/>+ when it is necessary <lb/>to designate the specific decay f ). Measurements of F + for the <lb/>decays D → π + π − π 0 and D → K + K − π 0 were performed, mak-<lb/>ing use of quantum-correlated D D decays coherently produced at <lb/></body>

			<body>the ψ(3770) resonance and collected by the CLEO-c detector. In <lb/>this Letter a first measurement is presented of the CP content <lb/>of the four-body mode D → π + π − π + π − , again exploiting CLEO-<lb/>c ψ(3770) data. This fully-charged and relatively abundant final <lb/>state [2] can be reconstructed with good efficiency by the LHCb <lb/>detector and hence is a promising mode for improving the deter-<lb/>mination of γ at that experiment, as well as at Belle II. <lb/>The three-body analysis reported in Ref. [1] exploited events in <lb/>which one D meson is reconstructed in the signal mode and the <lb/>other &apos;tagging&apos; meson in its decay to a CP eigenstate. The measure-<lb/>ment of F 4π <lb/>+ presented in this Letter follows the same method, <lb/>but augments it with other approaches, in particular a comple-<lb/>mentary strategy in which the tagging modes are D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − , <lb/>and attention is paid to where on the Dalitz plot this tag decay <lb/>occurs. In order to benefit from this strategy for the previously <lb/>studied decays, this Letter also presents measurements of F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>and F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>using D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags.

			<body>assumption given theoretical expectations and current experimen-<lb/>tal limits [2-4]. However, as discussed in Ref. [5], knowledge of <lb/>F + also allows such D decays to be used to study CP-violating <lb/>observables and mixing parameters through time-dependent mea-<lb/>surements at facilities where the mesons are produced incoher-<lb/>ently. <lb/>The remainder of the Letter is structured as follows. Section 2 <lb/>introduces the CP-even fraction F + , derives the relations that are <lb/>used to measure its value at the ψ(3770) resonance, and reviews <lb/>how knowledge of F + allows non-CP eigenstates to be cleanly <lb/>employed in the measurement of γ with B ∓ → D K ∓ decays. Sec-<lb/>tion 3 describes the data set and event selection. Sections 4, 5 <lb/>and 6 presents the determination of F + using CP tags, D → <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags and other tags, respectively. In Section 7 combina-<lb/>tions of the individual sets of results are performed for each signal <lb/>mode; for D → π + π − π 0 and D → K + K − π 0 these combinations <lb/>include the results from Ref. [1]. Section 8 gives the conclusions. <lb/>2. Measuring the CP content of a self-conjugate D-meson decay <lb/>and the consequences for the γ determination with B ∓ → D K ∓ <lb/>Let the amplitude of a D 0 meson decaying to a self-conjugate <lb/>final state f be written as A(D 0 → f (x)) ≡ a x e iθ x , where x in-<lb/>dicates a particular point in the decay phase space and θ x is a <lb/>CP-conserving strong phase. The amplitude is normalised such that <lb/>x∈D <lb/>|A(D 0 → f (x))| 2 dx = B( f ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where B( f ) is the branching fraction of the D 0 decay and D in-<lb/>dicates the entire phase space. The D 0 decay amplitude at x is <lb/>denoted a xe iθ x , where x indicates the point in phase space reached <lb/>by applying a CP transformation to the final-state system at x. CP <lb/>violation in the charm system is neglected, which implies that the <lb/>D 0 decay amplitude at x is equal to the D 0 amplitude at x. It is <lb/>useful to define the strong phase difference θ x ≡ θ x − θ x. <lb/>It is possible to express the CP-even fraction in terms of the <lb/>decay amplitudes introduced above. Let the CP eigenstates be <lb/>|D CP± ≡ (|D 0 ± |D 0 )/ <lb/>√ <lb/>2 and consider the decay D 0 → f in <lb/>terms of these states. The total CP-even fraction of the inclusive <lb/>decay is defined as <lb/>F <lb/>f <lb/>+ ≡ <lb/>x∈D | f (x)|D CP+ | 2 dx <lb/>x∈D | f (x)|D CP+ | 2 + | f (x)|D CP− | 2 dx <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>and so <lb/>F <lb/>f <lb/>+ = x∈D a 2 <lb/>x + a 2 <lb/>x + 2a x a x cos θ x dx <lb/>x∈D 2(a 2 <lb/>x + a 2 <lb/>x ) dx <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>⎡ <lb/>⎣ 1 + <lb/>1 <lb/>B( f ) <lb/>x∈D <lb/>a x a x cos θ x dx <lb/>⎤ <lb/>⎦ . <lb/>(3) <lb/>Note also that the following relation is always true in the absence <lb/>of CP violation: <lb/>x∈D <lb/>a x a x sin θ x dx = 0. <lb/>(4) <lb/>Now consider a quantum-correlated D D system produced in <lb/>the decay of a ψ(3770) meson. One of the D mesons in the system <lb/>decays to f at the point x, the other to g at y, where in general <lb/>the phase space of the two decays is different. The amplitude of <lb/>the latter decay is denoted b y e iφ y in analogy with the terminology <lb/>used above. <lb/>The amplitude of the ψ(3770) → D D → f g correlated wave-<lb/>function can be written [6] <lb/>A( f (x)|g(y)) = <lb/>1 <lb/>√ <lb/>2 <lb/>a x e iθ x b ȳ e iφ ȳ − a xe iθ x b y e iφ y . <lb/>(5) <lb/>The resulting decay probability is then <lb/>P( f (x)|g(y)) <lb/>∝ a 2 <lb/>x b 2 <lb/>ȳ + a 2 <lb/>x b 2 <lb/>y <lb/>− 2a x b ȳa xb y cos θ x cos φ y + sin θ x sin φ y . <lb/>(6) <lb/>If both D mesons decay to the same final state the probability is <lb/>divided by two to avoid double counting. This formula can be used <lb/>to determine the population of quantum-correlated decays either <lb/>integrated over all phase space or after dividing the phase space <lb/>into bins. <lb/>The number of &apos;double-tagged&apos; candidates in which one D me-<lb/>son decays to f and the other to g, integrating over the phase <lb/>space of each decay, is <lb/>M( f |g) = ZB( f )B(g) 1 − 2F <lb/>f <lb/>+ − 1 2F <lb/>g <lb/>+ − 1 , <lb/>(7) <lb/>where Z is a normalisation constant common to all decay modes. <lb/>An important special case, considered in Section 4, is where the <lb/>tagging-mode g is a CP eigenstate, and (2F <lb/>g <lb/>+ − 1) reduces to ±1. <lb/>Section 6 describes an analysis of classes of double-tags where this <lb/>is not the case. <lb/>Alternatively, when the tagging-mode g is a multibody decay, <lb/>its phase space may be divided into bins. Integrating over the <lb/>phase space of f results in the following decay probability in bin i <lb/>of the phase space of g: <lb/>P( f |g i ) ∝ <lb/>y∈D i <lb/>b 2 <lb/>y + b 2 <lb/>ȳ − 2F <lb/>f <lb/>+ − 1 b y b ȳ cos φ y dy, <lb/>(8) <lb/>where D i indicates the phase space encompassed by bin i. In Sec-<lb/>tion 5 this relation is exploited for the tags D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − . <lb/>To understand the relevance of the CP-even fraction in the mea-<lb/>surement of the unitarity-triangle angle γ consider the decay of a <lb/>B − meson to D K − , following which the D meson decays to a self-<lb/>conjugate final state f consisting of three or more particles. The <lb/>amplitude of the B − decay is a superposition of two decay paths: <lb/>A(B − ) = A(B − → D 0 K − )A(D 0 → f ) <lb/>+ A(B − → D 0 K − )A(D 0 → f ). <lb/>(9) <lb/>Following the formalism developed above, the decay amplitude <lb/>of the D 0 meson at the point x in the phase space is denoted <lb/>a x e iθ x . The decay amplitude of the B − meson at this point in phase <lb/>space is therefore <lb/>A(B − (x)) = A(B − → D 0 K − ) a x e iθ x + r B e i(δ B −γ ) a xe iθ x , <lb/>(10) <lb/>where r B and δ B are respectively the ratio of moduli and the <lb/>strong phase difference between the suppressed and favoured B − <lb/>decay amplitudes. The resulting decay probability is <lb/>P(B − (x)) ∝ a 2 <lb/>x + r 2 <lb/>B a 2 <lb/>x + 2r B a x a x cos (δ B − γ + θ x − θ x) <lb/>= a 2 <lb/>x + r 2 <lb/>B a 2 <lb/>x + 2r B a x a x cos(δ B − γ ) cos θ x <lb/>− sin(δ B − γ ) sin θ x . <lb/>(11) <lb/></body>

The total yield of B ∓ decays is deter-<lb/>mined by integrating over the entire D phase space: <lb/>Y ∓ = h ∓ <lb/>x∈D <lb/>P(B ∓ (x)) dx <lb/>= h ∓ 1 + r 2 <lb/>B + 2F <lb/>f <lb/>+ − 1 2r B cos(δ B ∓ γ ) , <lb/>(12) <lb/>where h ∓ is a normalisation constant and Eqs. (3) and (4) have <lb/>been employed. This expression is very similar to that derived in <lb/>Ref. [7] for the case when the D meson decays to a CP eigenstate <lb/>and is indeed identical in the event F <lb/>f <lb/>+ = 0 or 1. Hence measure-<lb/>ments of Y ∓ , and observables built from these yields [1], can be <lb/>used to obtain information on the angle γ and the other param-<lb/>eters of the B ∓ decay, provided that F <lb/>f <lb/>+ is known. In Ref. [1] <lb/>it is demonstrated how the effects of D 0 D 0 mixing, neglected in <lb/>Eq. (12), may also be accommodated. <lb/>3. Data set and event selection <lb/>The data set analysed consists of e + e − collisions produced by <lb/>the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 3.77 GeV corre-<lb/>sponding to an integrated luminosity of 818 pb −1 and collected <lb/>with the CLEO-c detector. The CLEO-c detector is described in de-<lb/>tail elsewhere [8]. Monte Carlo simulated samples of signal decays <lb/>are used to estimate selection efficiencies. Possible background <lb/>contributions are determined from a generic D 0 D 0 simulated sam-<lb/>ple corresponding to approximately fifteen times the integrated <lb/>luminosity of the data set. The EVTGEN generator [9] is used to <lb/>simulate the decays. The detector response is modelled using the <lb/>GEANT software package [10]. <lb/>Table 1 lists the D-meson final states considered in the analy-<lb/>sis. Double-tag candidates are reconstructed in which one D me-<lb/>son decays into π + π − π + π − and the other into a CP eigenstate, <lb/>or where one D meson decays into π + π − π + π − , π + π − π 0 or <lb/>K + K − π 0 and the other into one of the mixed-CP modes K 0 <lb/>S π + π − <lb/>or K 0 <lb/>L π + π − . The combinations π + π − π + π − vs. π + π − π + π − and <lb/>π + π − π + π − vs. π + π − π 0 are also reconstructed. <lb/>The unstable final state particles are reconstructed in the fol-<lb/>lowing decay modes: π 0 → γ γ , K 0 <lb/>S → π + π − , ω → π + π − π 0 , <lb/>η → γ γ , η → π + π − π 0 and η → η(γ γ )π + π − . The π 0 , K 0 <lb/>S , ω, <lb/>η and η reconstruction procedure is identical to that used in <lb/>Ref. [11]. <lb/>Final states that do not contain a K 0 <lb/>L are fully reconstructed via <lb/>the beam-constrained candidate mass, m bc ≡ s/(4c 4 ) − p 2 <lb/>D /c 2 , <lb/>where p D is the D-candidate momentum, and E ≡ E D − <lb/>√ <lb/>s/2, <lb/>where E D is the D-candidate energy. The m bc and E distributions <lb/>of correctly reconstructed D-meson candidates peak at the nomi-<lb/>nal D 0 mass and zero, respectively. Neither E nor m bc distribu-<lb/>tions exhibit any peaking structure for combinatoric background. <lb/>The double-tag yield is determined from counting events in sig-<lb/>nal and sideband regions of m bc after placing requirements on <lb/>E [1,11-13]. The selection criteria of candidates involving the <lb/>modes D → K + K − and D → π + π − do not include the cosmic ray <lb/>muon and radiative Bhabha vetoes that are described in Ref. [1]. <lb/>This is because these sources of background do not contaminate <lb/>the double-tag sample, and the vetoes are found to perturb the <lb/>selection efficiency of the other D meson in the event. When <lb/>selecting D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − candidates it is demanded that the K 0 <lb/>S <lb/>decay products form a vertex that is significantly displaced from <lb/>the e + e − collision point; in contrast, for D → π + π − π + π − and <lb/>D → π + π − π 0 candidates the π + π − vertex must be consistent <lb/>with originating from the collision point in order to suppress con-<lb/>tamination from D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − and D → K 0 <lb/>S π 0 decays, respec-<lb/>tively. <lb/>The double-tag yield determination procedure is identical to <lb/>that presented in Refs. [11,12] except for the selections where the <lb/>signal decay is π + π − π + π − and the tag decay is K + K − , π + π − , <lb/>π + π − π 0 or π + π − π + π − , which are all dominated by a back-<lb/>ground from continuum production of light quark-antiquark pairs. <lb/>For these modes an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed <lb/>to the distribution of the average m bc of the two D-meson candi-<lb/>dates. The background is modelled with an ARGUS function [14] <lb/>and the signal is modelled with the sum of two Crystal Ball func-<lb/>tions [15] with power-law tails on opposite sides. The parameters <lb/>of the Crystal Ball functions are fixed from fits to large samples of <lb/>simulated data. <lb/>Figs. 1(a) and (b) show the average m bc distributions for <lb/>CP-tagged D → π + π − π + π − candidates, summed over all tag <lb/>modes that are CP-even and CP-odd eigenstates, respectively, <lb/>where the CP-tag final state does not contain a K 0 <lb/>L meson. <lb/>Fig. 2 shows the average m bc distributions for D → π + π − π + π − , <lb/>D → π + π − π 0 and D → K + K − π 0 candidates tagged with D → <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S π + π − decays, while Figs. 3(a)-(c) show the Dalitz-plot distri-<lb/>butions of the tag decay for these three signal modes. <lb/>Many K 0 <lb/>L mesons do not deposit any reconstructible signal <lb/>in the detector. However, double-tag candidates can be fully re-<lb/>constructed using a missing-mass squared (m 2 <lb/>miss ) technique [16] <lb/>for tags containing a single K 0 <lb/>L meson. Yields are determined <lb/>from the signal and sideband regions of the m 2 <lb/>miss distribution. <lb/>Fig. 1(c) shows the m 2 <lb/>miss distributions for D → π + π − π + π − can-<lb/>Fig. 1.

For double tags in-<lb/>volving a CP mode without a K 0 <lb/>L meson the peaking backgrounds <lb/>are found to constitute 5-10% of the selected events, and are pre-<lb/>dominantly from residual D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − contamination. The peak-<lb/>ing backgrounds for final states with a K 0 <lb/>L are generally larger; for <lb/>K 0 <lb/>L π 0 and K 0 <lb/>L ω this contamination amounts to 15-20% of the sig-<lb/>nal yield, whereas for K 0 <lb/>L π + π − it is ∼ 10% of the signal yield. <lb/>The dominant source of peaking background in each case is the <lb/>equivalent decay containing a K 0 <lb/>S instead of a K 0 <lb/>L meson. The con-<lb/>tamination from specific modes in the other categories of double <lb/>tags is typically 10% or less. The statistical uncertainties on these <lb/>background estimates arising from the finite size of the simulated <lb/>samples are included in the total statistical uncertainties on the <lb/>signal yields. <lb/>The measured double-tag event yields after background sub-<lb/>traction are given in Table 2. <lb/></body>

Analysis with the CP tags <lb/>The yields of the single and double tags containing a CP eigen-<lb/>state are used as inputs to determine the CP-even fraction, F 4π <lb/>+ . <lb/>Following on from Eq.

The <lb/>double tag yield is denoted by M − (M + ) for CP-even (CP-odd) <lb/>tags. Experimentally it is advantageous to eliminate dependence <lb/>on N D D , the branching fractions and the reconstruction efficiency, <lb/>which can be achieved by normalising by the single-tag yields. The <lb/>yield of single tags, S + (S − ) decaying to a CP-odd (CP-even) eigen-<lb/>state X , is given by <lb/>S(X) = 2N D D B(X)ε(X), <lb/>(14) <lb/>where ε(X) is the reconstruction efficiency of the single tag. The <lb/>small effects of D 0 D 0 mixing are eliminated from the measure-<lb/>ment by correcting the measured single-tag yields S ± <lb/>meas such that <lb/>S ± = S ± <lb/>meas /(1 − η CP y D ) where y D = (0.62 ± 0.08)% is the well-<lb/>known D-mixing parameter [17]. A further correction is applied <lb/>in the case of the tags K + K − and π + π − because of the differing <lb/>selection requirements for the single and double-tag case, as de-<lb/>scribed in Section 3. This correction factor is determined by taking <lb/>the ratio of the selection efficiency of the single tag from sim-<lb/>ulation with the two differing selections. It is determined to be <lb/>1.15 and 1.10 for the D → K + K − and D → π + π − modes, respec-<lb/>tively, with an uncertainty of ±0.05. The other uncertainties on <lb/>these single-tag yields are assigned following the same procedure <lb/>described in Ref. [1]. <lb/>For the case of the two CP tags involving a K 0 <lb/>L meson a differ-<lb/>ent treatment is required, since it is not possible to measure the <lb/>single-tag yield directly for these modes. Following the procedure <lb/>described in Ref. [1], the effective single-tag yield is evaluated us-<lb/>ing Eq. (14), where the effective single-tag efficiency ε(K 0 <lb/>L X) is <lb/>calculated from the ratio of ε(4π|K 0 <lb/>L X)/ε(4π ), and the leading <lb/>systematic uncertainties are associated with the branching frac-<lb/>tions and the value used for the effective single-tag efficiency. The <lb/>effective single-tag yields are determined to be 21 726 ± 3497 and <lb/>9124 ± 4105 for K 0 <lb/>L π 0 and K 0 <lb/>L ω, respectively. <lb/>Assuming that the reconstruction efficiencies of each D meson <lb/>are independent, then the ratio of the double-tagged and single-<lb/>tagged yields are independent of the branching fraction and recon-<lb/>struction efficiency of the CP tag and N D D . This ratio is defined as <lb/>N + ≡ M + /S + , with an analogous expression for N − . The CP-even <lb/>fraction F 4π <lb/>+ is then given by <lb/>F 4π <lb/>+ = <lb/>N + <lb/>N + + N − . <lb/>(15) <lb/>The measured values for N + and N − for each CP tag are dis-<lb/>played in Fig. 5. It can be seen that there is consistency be-<lb/>tween the individual tags for each measurement. The mean value <lb/>&lt;N + &gt; = (5.54 ± 0.46) × 10 −3 is significantly larger than &lt;N − &gt; = <lb/>(1.80 ± 0.32) × 10 −3 , indicating that the π + π − π + π − final state <lb/>is predominantly CP even. <lb/>If the acceptance across the phase space of the D → <lb/>π + π − π + π − decay is not uniform it has the potential to bias <lb/>the measurement of F 4π <lb/>+ . Using simulated data the selection ef-<lb/>Fig. 5. D → π + π − π + π − results for (a) N + and (b) N − .

			<body>ficiency of individual pions in D → π + π − π + π − decays is de-<lb/>termined in bins of momentum and polar angle with respect to <lb/>the beam direction. The candidates in data are then weighted by <lb/>the normalised efficiency. Each pion is treated independently and <lb/>an overall weight, typically lying within 5-10% of unity, is found <lb/>by multiplying the individual weights. The scaled signal yields are <lb/>used to re-determine F 4π <lb/>+ and the difference between this and the <lb/>value found without efficiency correction is 0.008, which is taken <lb/>as the systematic uncertainty due to non-uniform acceptance. <lb/>Using the CP tags only, and accounting for the correlations be-<lb/>tween the systematic uncertainties, yields F 4π <lb/>+ = 0.754 ± 0.031 ± <lb/>0.021, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second sys-<lb/>tematic. <lb/>5. Analysis with the D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags <lb/>For each of the signal samples that are tagged by D → <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S π + π − or D → K 0 <lb/>L π + π − decays the Dalitz plot of the tag <lb/>mode is divided into eight pairs of symmetric bins by the line <lb/>m 2 <lb/>+ = m 2 <lb/>− , where m 2 <lb/>± is the invariant-mass squared of the π ± K 0 <lb/>S,L <lb/>pair. The bins lying on one side of this line (m 2 <lb/>+ &gt; m 2 <lb/>− ) are labelled <lb/>−1 → −8, and those on the other side 1 → 8. The binning def-<lb/>inition follows the &apos;Equal δ D BABAR 2008&apos; scheme of Ref. [18], <lb/>in which the boundaries are chosen according to the strong-phase <lb/>prediction of a model developed by the BaBar collaboration [19]. <lb/>The expected distribution of entries is symmetric and so the anal-<lb/>ysis considers the absolute bin number |i|, which contains the <lb/>contents of the pair of bins −i and i. <lb/>Following Eq. (8), the expected population of bin |i| for signal <lb/>decays with K 0 <lb/>S π + π − tags is <lb/>M |i| = h K i + K −i − 2F + − 1 2c i K i K −i , <lb/>(16) <lb/>where h is a normalisation factor specific to the signal category, <lb/>K i is the flavour-tagged fraction, being the proportion of K 0 <lb/>S π + π − <lb/>decays to fall in bin i in the case that the mother particle is known <lb/>to be a D 0 meson, and c i is the cosine of the strong-phase differ-<lb/>ence between D 0 and D0 decays averaged in bin i and weighted <lb/>by the absolute decay rate (a precise definition may be found in <lb/>Ref. [6]). The only difference between the form of this expression <lb/>and the case when the signal decays into a pure CP-even eigen-<lb/>state [6] is the prefactor of (2F + − 1) in the final term. <lb/>Similarly, when the tagging meson decays to K 0 <lb/>L π + π − then the <lb/>number of double-tag decays produced in bin |i| is <lb/>M |i| = h K i + K −i + 2F + − 1 2c i K i K −i , <lb/>(17) <lb/>where the primed quantities are now specific to this case. The re-<lb/>versed sign in front of the final term reflects the fact that the K 0 <lb/>L <lb/>meson is almost entirely a CP-odd eigenstate. <lb/>The values of c i and c i within these bins have been measured <lb/>by the CLEO collaboration [18]. The values of the K i parameters <lb/>are taken from an analysis of the predictions of various B-factory <lb/>models [19-22] presented in Ref. [13], and those of the K i param-<lb/>eters from measurements performed with CLEO-c data [23]. <lb/>The double-tagged samples are analysed to determine the <lb/>background-subtracted signal yield in each Dalitz-plot bin. The dis-<lb/>tribution of background between the different bins is assigned <lb/>according to its category. Flat background is assumed to con-<lb/>tribute proportionally to the bin area. Peaking backgrounds that <lb/>occur on the signal side affect the distribution of tag decays in <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − phase space according to their nature. For example, in <lb/>the case of D → K 0 <lb/>S π 0 decays that are wrongly reconstructed as <lb/>D → π + π − π 0 , the tag decay will be in a CP-even state and dis-<lb/>tributed accordingly. Similarly, the distribution of K 0 <lb/>S (π 0 π 0 )π + π − <lb/>Table 3 <lb/>Double-tagged signal yields vs. K 0 <lb/>S π + π − after background subtraction in absolute <lb/>bin numbers of the D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − Dalitz plot.

The distribution of the residual <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S π + π − vs. K 0 <lb/>S π + π − events that contaminate the π + π − π + π − <lb/>vs. K 0 <lb/>S π + π − selection is determined from data by inverting the <lb/>K 0 <lb/>S veto on the signal decay. <lb/>It is also necessary to account for relative bin-to-bin efficiency <lb/>variations in the background-subtracted signal yields. The correc-<lb/>tion factors are determined from simulation and typically differ <lb/>5% from unity. The signal yields in each bin after background <lb/>subtraction and relative efficiency correction are shown in Table 3 <lb/>for K 0 <lb/>S π + π − tags and in Table 4 for K 0 <lb/>L π + π − tags. <lb/>A log-likelihood fit is performed to the efficiency-corrected sig-<lb/>nal yields of each sample, assuming the expected distributions <lb/>given by Eqs. (16) and (17). The fit parameters are the CP-even <lb/>fraction and the overall normalisation. The values of K i , K i , c i and <lb/>c i are also fitted, but with their measurement uncertainties and <lb/>correlations imposed with Gaussian constraints. Separate fits are <lb/>performed for the D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − tags, the D → K 0 <lb/>L π + π − tags, <lb/>and for both samples combined. Fits to large ensembles of simu-<lb/>lated experiments demonstrate that the returned uncertainties are <lb/>reliable and that there is no significant bias in the procedure. All <lb/>data fits are found to be of good quality. The results are plot-<lb/>ted in Fig. 6 for the D → K 0 <lb/>S π + π − tags and in Fig. 7 for the <lb/>D → K 0 <lb/>L π + π − tags. The numerical results for the CP-even frac-<lb/>tion are given in Table 5 for D → π + π − π + π − and in Table 6 for <lb/>D → π + π − π 0 and D → K + K − π 0 . <lb/>The dominant systematic uncertainty is associated with the dis-<lb/>tribution of the continuum and combinatoric backgrounds. This is <lb/>assessed by repeating the measurement with these contributions <lb/>switched to those found in the sidebands of the signal distri-<lb/>butions. Shifts of 0.020, 0.019 and 0.037 are observed for F 4π <lb/>+ , <lb/>F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>and F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>, respectively. The uncertainty associated with <lb/>the measurement errors on K i , K i , c i and c i is estimated by re-<lb/>running the fit with these quantities set as fixed parameters and <lb/>subtracting in quadrature the new fit uncertainty from that ob-<lb/>tained with the original procedure. This component is found to <lb/>be 0.013 for D → π + π − π + π − , 0.010 for D → π + π − π 0 and <lb/></body>

The total systematic uncertainties are given in Tables 5 <lb/>and 6 and are in all cases significantly smaller than the corre-<lb/>sponding statistical uncertainties. <lb/>6. Other tags <lb/>The double-tagged yield of π + π − π + π − vs. π + π − π 0 can be <lb/>used to determine F 4π <lb/>+ , benefiting from the well-measured value <lb/>of F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>. The ratio of double-tag and D → π + π − π 0 single-tag <lb/>yields is defined as N πππ 0 ≡ M(4π |πππ 0 )/S(πππ 0 ), where a <lb/>very small correction is applied to the measured single-tag yield <lb/>to account for mixing effects. Following from Eq. (7), the ratio <lb/>N πππ 0 /N + removes dependence on the signal branching fraction <lb/>and reconstruction efficiency and is given by <lb/>N πππ 0 <lb/>N + = <lb/>1 − 2F 4π <lb/>+ − 1 2F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>− 1 <lb/>2F 4π <lb/>+ <lb/>, <lb/>(18) <lb/>which can be rearranged to yield <lb/>F 4π <lb/>+ = <lb/>N + F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>N πππ 0 − N + + 2N + F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>. <lb/>(19) <lb/>The choice of N + in the denominator of Eq. (18) is preferred to <lb/>N − as it is measured with better relative precision. <lb/>Taking as input the yields given in Section 3, the value of N + <lb/>reported in Section 4 and the final result for F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>presented in <lb/>Section 7 implies F 4π <lb/>+ = 0.695 ± 0.050 ± 0.021, where the un-<lb/>certainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. The main <lb/>contributions to the systematic uncertainty arise from: the mea-<lb/>surement of the D → πππ 0 single-tag yield and small violations <lb/>of the efficiency-factorisation ansatz assumed in Eq. (18); the un-<lb/>derstanding of the peaking background component in the sample; <lb/>and the possible effects of non-uniform acceptance. <lb/>The self-tagged yield of π + π − π + π − vs. π + π − π + π − also car-<lb/>ries information on the value of F 4π <lb/>+ . This sample is however only <lb/>used for a consistency check, as there are large backgrounds from <lb/>both the continuum and from misidentification of D → K 0 <lb/>S ππ de-<lb/>cays that are a potential source of significant systematic bias. Fur-<lb/>thermore, the predicted yield and measurement uncertainty means <lb/>that the result from analysis of these double tags would have low <lb/>weight in the combined measurement of F 4π <lb/>+ . Using Eq. (7) the <lb/>number of observed self-tagged events is given by <lb/>M(4π |4π ) = 4RF 4π <lb/>+ 1 − F 4π <lb/>+ , <lb/>(20) <lb/></body>

Combination of results <lb/>The results for F 4π <lb/>+ from the CP tags, the K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags and <lb/>the π + π − π 0 tag are summarised in Table 7. They are compatible <lb/>and are therefore combined, taking account of correlated uncer-<lb/>tainties. Correlations arise from the non-flat Dalitz plot acceptance <lb/>between all three measurements and the use of N + as an input <lb/>to both the CP tags and π + π − π 0 tag measurements. There is a <lb/>further small correlation between the results obtained with the CP <lb/>and π + π − π 0 tags, associated with the uncertainty on the value of <lb/>the mixing parameter y D . The final result is F 4π <lb/>+ = 0.737 ± 0.028. <lb/>Table 8 summarises the results on F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>and F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>ob-<lb/>tained with K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags, together with those determined from <lb/>CP tags. The K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − measurements confirm the results of <lb/>the earlier analysis. A combination is performed, accounting for <lb/>the sole source of correlated uncertainties, which is that arising <lb/>from the non-uniform acceptance over the Dalitz plots. Results of <lb/>F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>= 0.973 ± 0.017 and F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>= 0.732 ± 0.055 are obtained. <lb/>The K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − tags improve the relative precision on F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>by <lb/>6% and on F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>by 10%. <lb/>8. Conclusions <lb/>A first measurement has been made of the CP-even fraction <lb/>of the decay D → π + π − π + π − , exploiting quantum-correlated <lb/>double-tags involving CP-eigenstates, a binned Dalitz-plot analysis <lb/>of the modes D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − , and D → π + π − π 0 decays. The re-<lb/>sult, F 4π <lb/>+ = 0.737 ±0.028, when considered alongside the relatively <lb/>high branching fraction, indicates that this channel is a valuable <lb/>addition to the suite of D decays that can be harnessed for the <lb/>measurement of the unitarity-triangle angle γ through the process <lb/>B ∓ → D K ± . The decays D → K 0 <lb/>S,L π + π − have also been employed <lb/>as a tag to measure the CP contents of the modes D → π + π − π 0 <lb/>and D → K + K − π 0 . The results confirm the conclusion of a pre-<lb/>vious analysis [1], based on CP-eigenstate tags, and also suggested <lb/>by earlier amplitude-model studies [24-26], that the CP-even con-<lb/>tent of the π + π − π 0 final state is very high, and therefore this <lb/>decay too is a powerful mode for the measurement of γ . Combin-<lb/>ing the two sets of measurements yields F πππ 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>= 0.973 ± 0.017 <lb/>and F K K π 0 <lb/>+ <lb/>= 0.732 ± 0.055. Now that their CP-even fractions have <lb/>been measured, all three decay modes may also be used for stud-<lb/>ies of indirect CP violation and mixing in the D 0 D 0 system [5]. <lb/></body>
