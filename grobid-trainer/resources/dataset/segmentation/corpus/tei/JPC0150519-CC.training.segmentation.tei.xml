			<body>The recent discovery of superconductivity in a two-<lb/>dimensional cobalt oxyhydrate [1] has been spurring new <lb/>round of intense interest in the field of superconductivity <lb/>research. It was mentioned [1, 2] that the cobalt oxy-<lb/>hydrate superconductor resembles the high-T c cuprates <lb/>in the two-dimensional (2D) MO (M=Co or Cu) lay-<lb/>ers and the existence of spin 1/2 for Co 4+ and Cu 2+ <lb/>ions, though their difference is obvious for the triangular <lb/>CoO 2 sheets in contrast with the nearly tetragonal CuO <lb/>planes. The fact that the superconductivity is derived <lb/>from the intercalation of H O into the host Na 0.35 CoO 2 , <lb/>which itself is not a superconductor, suggests that strong <lb/>two-dimensionality be important for the appearance of <lb/>superconductivity [1]. <lb/>The related theoretical work has been performed <lb/>quickly, though some basic physical property character-<lb/>izations of the new superconductors have not been re-<lb/>ported yet. By employing the t−J model on a planar tri-<lb/>angular lattice, different kinds of superconducting states, <lb/>such as time-reversal-symmetry-breaking d x 2 −y 2 + id xy <lb/>superconductivity [3, 4, 5], and spin triplet supercon-<lb/>ductivity [3, 6] have been proposed. Based on the den-<lb/>sity functional calculation, Singh [7] also speculates that <lb/>a triplet superconducting state may exist in this kind of <lb/>material. In a word, exotic superconductivity in the new <lb/>system seems to be a consensus for theorists. To verify <lb/>the theoretical result, therefore, the experimental inves-<lb/>tigations becomes very crucial on this topic. <lb/>Unfortunately, the development on the experimental <lb/>aspect goes relatively slowly. One of the major reasons <lb/>is that the preparation of samples is not optimized at <lb/>present. The other reason concerns about the chemical <lb/>instability of the oxyhydrate superconductor. It was re-<lb/>ported [8] that the material is exceptionally sensitive to <lb/>both temperature and humidity near ambient conditions, <lb/>which makes the experimental reproducibility rather dif-<lb/>ficult. Consequently, only a few experimental results, <lb/>such as the magnetic properties [9] and the hydrostatic <lb/>pressure effect on T c [10] have just been reported. Al-<lb/>though some unconventional magnetic properties were <lb/>revealed for the new superconductor [9], other basic prop-<lb/>erties such as the low-temperature specific heat have not <lb/>been reported yet for this newly-discovered supercon-<lb/>ductor. We recently succeeded in preparing the cobalt <lb/>oxyhydrate superconductor using a modified synthetic <lb/>route [11]. The problem of the sample&apos;s instability was <lb/>overcome to some extent by employing suitable experi-<lb/>mental procedure. In this Letter, we report some super-<lb/>conducting and normal-state properties of this intriguing <lb/>compound. <lb/>Our samples of Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O were prepared in <lb/>four steps, briefly described as follows. First, single-<lb/>phase hexagonal Na 0.74 CoO 2 was prepared by a solid-<lb/>state reaction at 1083 K in flowing oxygen with Na 2 CO 3 <lb/>and Co 3 O 4 as the starting material. Second, partial <lb/>sodium in Na 0.74 CoO 2 was deintercalated by the exces-<lb/>sive bromine solved in acetonitrile, similar to the treat-<lb/>ment reported previously [1, 8]. Third, a hydration pro-<lb/>cess was carried out by the direct reaction with distilled <lb/>water. Last, the sample was slightly dehydrated and <lb/>then &quot;annealed&quot; under ambient condition. Powder X-<lb/>ray Diffraction (XRD) measurement indicates that the <lb/>final product is a hexagonal single phase with the cell <lb/>constants of a=2.820Å and c=19.65Å . The unit cell is <lb/>slightly stretched along the c-axis, compared with that <lb/>of the previous report [1]. This is probably due to the <lb/>difference in the Na content. By employing the Atomic <lb/>absorption spectroscopy, the atomic ratio of Na and Co <lb/>was determined as 0.31 for the final product. Thermo-<lb/>gravimetric analysis shows that the weight loss from 293 <lb/>K to 693 K is 19.8 %, indicating that the content of H O <lb/>is about 1.3 per formula. Therefore, the chemical formula <lb/>of the final product is expressed as Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O . <lb/>Details of the sample&apos;s preparation and characterizations <lb/>will be given elsewhere [11]. <lb/>The physical property measurements were performed <lb/>at the temperature down to 1.8 K and under the field up <lb/>to 8 Tesla, on a Quantum Design PPMS system. While <lb/></body>

			<body>measured under &quot;zero field&quot;, there still exists a remanent <lb/>field of ∼ Oe. The precisions of ac magnetic suscep-<lb/>tibility (χ ac ) and dc susceptibility (χ dc ) are better than <lb/>∼ 10 −7 emu and ∼ −5 emu, respectively. The electri-<lb/>cal resistivity (ρ) was measured in a standard four-probe <lb/>configuration using a pressed sample bar. The heat ca-<lb/>pacity was measured using an automated relaxation tech-<lb/>nique with a square piece of ∼ 20 mg sample. The con-<lb/>tribution from the addenda has been subtracted. It is <lb/>noted that the handling of the sample and the detailed <lb/>measurement procedure sometimes affect the experimen-<lb/>tal result very much. So, we kept the same experimental <lb/>condition for the different measurements. <lb/>Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of <lb/>magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures for the <lb/>Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O sample. The real part of ac suscep-<lb/>tibility χ ′ shows the onset of diamagnetism at 4.3 K, <lb/>followed by a broad superconducting transition, similar <lb/>to the original report [1]. The diamagnetic screening sig-<lb/>nal at 1.9 K is 9.2 % of the full shielding when the ac <lb/>field amplitude (H ac ) is 2 Oe, suggesting relatively low <lb/>superconducting fraction. Considering that the χ ′ value <lb/>is not flat down to 1.9 K, the superconducting volume <lb/>fraction will be over 10 % under the remanent field of <lb/>∼ 1 Oe. The imaginary component of the ac susceptibil-<lb/>ity shows an incomplete dissipation peak, also suggesting <lb/>that the superconducting transition is not finished yet at <lb/>1.9 K. The dc susceptibility under 30 Oe shows even low <lb/>magnetic exclusion, which is primarily due to the very <lb/>low H c1 value as well as the magnetic penetration (see <lb/>the result below). An irreversible temperature can be <lb/>noticed, like that observed in the high T c cuprates [12]. <lb/>From the structural and chemical bonding points of <lb/>view, the present system should have very weak coupling <lb/>between the CoO layers, resulting in a strong 2D su-<lb/>perconductivity. It is proposed that the relatively low <lb/>superconducting fraction is mainly due to the sample&apos;s <lb/>intrinsic 2D characteristic. The following observations <lb/>are coincident with this point. First, the superconduct-<lb/>ing transition is broad. Second, zero resistance can never <lb/>be achieved in our experiments as well as the previous re-<lb/>port [1]. Third, the diamagnetic signal is enhanced when <lb/>decreasing H ac . Similar result was reported for a 2D or-<lb/>ganic superconductor (BEDT-TTF) 2 Cu(NCS) [13]. It <lb/>should be pointed out that the low superconducting frac-<lb/>tion is not mainly due to the sample&apos;s instability, because <lb/>our XRD experiment shows that the sample contains no <lb/>secondary phases before and after the magnetic suscep-<lb/>tibility measurements. <lb/>Figure 2(a) shows the magnetization loop at 1.9 K for <lb/>the Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O sample. Narrow field hystere-<lb/>sis was observed, superposed with a paramagnetic back-<lb/>ground which can be described by the Brillouin func-<lb/>tion. The amplificatory plot using the upper-right co-<lb/>ordinates indicates the type-II superconductivity with <lb/>H c1 of about 10 Oe at 1.9 K.

Hac, Tirr, FC and ZFC refer to the ac field am-<lb/>plitude, irreversible temperature, field cooling and zero-field <lb/>cooling, respectively. <lb/>of H c1 (T ) using the well-known equation: H c1 (T ) = <lb/>H c1 (0)[1 − (T /T c ) 2 ], H c1 (0) can be obtained as 13 Oe. <lb/>The H c2 value is difficult to be measured by the M − H <lb/>curve due to the very narrow hysteresis. Nevertheless, <lb/>by measuring the electrical resistance at fixed temper-<lb/>atures, one can basically obtain the H c2 (T ) data, as <lb/>shown in figure 2(b). H c2 (T ) is here determined as the <lb/>point where the resistance deviates from the linearity <lb/>in the R − H 2 curves [14]. The slope of H c2 at T c , <lb/>dH c2 /dT | Tc , is obtained as −34 kOe/K. H c2 (0) can <lb/>thus be estimated to be 1×10 5 Oe, using the WHH for-<lb/>mula [15]. Then, the average Ginzburg-Landau (GL) <lb/>coherent length ξ GL (0)=57Å can be calculated using <lb/>the formula ξ GL (0)=(Φ /2πH c2 (0)) 1/2 . On the other <lb/>hand, by solving the equation H c1 = Φ 0 ln(λ/ξ)/4πλ 2 , <lb/>the average penetration depths can also be obtained: <lb/>λ(0)=7900Å . Therefore, the Ginzburg-Landau param-<lb/>eter κ = λ/ξ GL is estimated as ∼ 140, indicating that <lb/>the cobalt oxyhydrate is an extreme type-II supercon-<lb/>ductor, like the high-T c cuprates. This conclusion has <lb/>also been drawn in a very recent report [9], in which dif-<lb/>ferent method was employed to determine the H c2 (T ). <lb/>It is worth while to note that, compared with the previ-<lb/>ous result, the values of H c1 (0) and H c2 (0) in the present <lb/>sample are remarkably smaller, which is possibly resulted <lb/>from the differences in the carrier-doping level and/or the <lb/>water content. <lb/>The result of low-temperature specific heat measure-<lb/>ment is shown in figure 3. At temperatures much below <lb/>the Debye temperature Θ D , and if neglected the possi-<lb/>ble magnetic contribution, the specific heat can be ex-<lb/>pressed as the sum of electron and phonon contributions: <lb/>C = γT + βT 3 , where the coefficient γ is generally called <lb/>

Note that <lb/>the upper-right axes are employed for the amplificatory plot <lb/>in (a). The inset of (b) shows the temperature dependence of <lb/>the upper critical field Hc2. <lb/>Sommerfeld parameter. The phonon contribution can be <lb/>separated by employing the T 2 vs C/T plot. It can be <lb/>seen that good linearity is satisfied in the temperature <lb/>range of 4.5 K&lt; T &lt;11 K. We thus obtained γ = 15.9 <lb/>mJ/K 2 •mol-f.u. (f.u. denotes formula unit) and β = <lb/>0.235 mJ/K 4 • mol-f.u. Θ D is then calculated to be 391 <lb/>K using the formula Θ D = ((12/5)N π 4 R/β) 1/3 , where <lb/>N =7.21 for Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O and R=8.314 J/mol•K. <lb/>The γ value is significantly smaller than that of the par-<lb/>ent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 (γ ∼ 40 mJ/K 2 •mol-Co [16]). <lb/>Since the Sommerfeld parameter γ is related to the den-<lb/>sity of state (DOS) at Fermi level, N (E F ), by the relation <lb/>γ = 1 <lb/>3 k 2 <lb/>B π 2 N (E F ) = 1 <lb/>3 k 2 <lb/>B π 2 N (0)(1 + λ ep ), where N (0) is <lb/>the bare, or band-structure electronic DOS at E F , λ ep an <lb/>electron-phonon interaction parameter [17], one can ob-<lb/>tain that N (E F )=6.7 states/eV•f.u. On the other hand, <lb/>λ ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula <lb/>λ ep = <lb/>1.04 + µ * ln(Θ D /1.45T c ) <lb/>(1 − 0.62µ * )ln(Θ D /1.45T c ) − 1.04 <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where Coulomb repulsion parameter µ * is assumed to be <lb/>0.13 empirically [17]. Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 <lb/>states/eV•f.u. We note that this value is almost identical <lb/>to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV•Co) for the <lb/>parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 [18]. <lb/>It is noted that the sample&apos;s magnetic susceptibility (∼ <lb/>2.0×10 −3 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature indepen-<lb/>dent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here). In order to <lb/>obtain the Pauli susceptibility χ P auli , the χ(T ) data were <lb/>fitted using the equation χ = χ 0 + AT 2 + C/(T − θ) [9]. <lb/>We obtained that χ 0 , A, C and θ are 0.0019 emu/mol, <lb/>2.6 ×10 −9 emu/mol•K 2 , 0.0024 emu•K/mol and 1.7 K, <lb/>respectively. The parameter C gives the small effective <lb/>magnetic moment of 0.14 µ B . The small positive θ value <lb/>suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations. <lb/>The unusually large χ 0 value should be dominantly con-<lb/>tributed by χ P auli , which is probably enhanced by the <lb/>Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation. The Wilson ra-<lb/>tio, R W = π 2 k 2 <lb/>B χ P auli /3γµ 2 <lb/>B , is calculated to be 11, in <lb/>sharp contrast with the case of heavy fermion supercon-<lb/>ductor [19]. <lb/>At 4.3 K, specific heat anomalies can be seen, which <lb/>is ascribed to the superconducting transition. The spe-<lb/>cific heat jump at the T c under zero field, ∆C obs , is 6.9 <lb/>mJ/K•mol-f.u, further confirming the bulk superconduc-<lb/>tivity. When applying magnetic field, both the ∆C obs <lb/>and T c decrease as expected. It is noted that the T c (H) <lb/>values are basically consistent with the H c2 (T ) result de-<lb/>scribed above. <lb/>The specific jump at T c , ∆C, can be calculated us-<lb/>ing an approximate formula ∆C = H c (0) 2 /2πT c , where <lb/>H c (0) is the thermodynamic critical field. H c (0) is found <lb/>to be 505 Oe by using the formula H c (0) = H c2 (0)/ <lb/>√ <lb/>2κ, <lb/>where H c2 (0) and κ are 1×10 5 Oe and 140, respec-<lb/>tively. Then, ∆C should be 38.2 mJ/K•mol-f.u. There-<lb/>fore, the superconducting fraction is estimated to be <lb/>∆C obs /∆C=18.1 %, which is basically consistent with <lb/>the magnetic susceptibility measurement result. In addi-<lb/>tion, the average superconducting gap at zero tempera-<lb/>ture, ∆ a (0), can be obtained using the relation [20], <lb/>2∆ a (0) <lb/>k B T c <lb/>= <lb/>4π <lb/>√ <lb/>3 <lb/>[ <lb/>H c (0) 2 V m <lb/>8πγT 2 <lb/>c <lb/>] 1/2 . <lb/>(2) <lb/>∆ a (0) is then obtained to be 0.50 meV. The value of <lb/>2∆ a (0)/k B T c is found to be 2.71, suggesting that the <lb/>system belongs to the weak coupling limit. <lb/>A further data-analysis was carried out as follows. The <lb/>lattice specific-heat contribution, C L = βT 3 , was first <lb/>deducted, obtaining the electronic specific heat term: <lb/>C el = C − C L . If the superconducting fraction is η, the <lb/>electronic specific heat of the full superconductor can be <lb/>normalized as C es =[C el −(1−η)γT ]/η. Figure 3(b) shows <lb/>the result with η=18.1 %. The Sommerfeld-parameter <lb/>jump at the T c , ∆C/T c , becomes 9 mJ/K 2 •mol-f.u. So, <lb/>the dimensionless parameter ∆C/γT value is about 0.57, <lb/>which is remarkably lower than the expected value 1.43 <lb/>

The electronic specific heat data in the super-<lb/>conducting state, Ces(T ), was fitted using different formula <lb/>containing just one fitting parameter (the coefficient). <lb/>for an isotropic gap. This suggests that the supercon-<lb/>ducting order parameter is basically not a s-wave. <lb/>As we know, the temperature dependence of C es may <lb/>give important information on the structure of the su-<lb/>perconducting gap. At the temperatures far below T c , <lb/>the temperature dependences of C es (T ) ∝ exp(−bT c /T ) <lb/>with b ∼ 1.5, C es (T ) ∝ T 3 and C es (T ) ∝ T 2 indicate an <lb/>isotropic BCS gap, point nodes and gap-zeroes along lines <lb/>in the superconducting gap structure, respectively [21]. <lb/>Though the extra-low temperature data is absent here <lb/>due to the experimental limitation, fitting on the present <lb/>data may give a preliminary clue. In figure 3(b), it can <lb/>be seen that the T 3 dependence best fits the C es (T ) data, <lb/>suggesting point nodes for the superconducting gap. It <lb/>should be mentioned that the T 3 dependence most favors <lb/>the data in the wide range of 13 % ≤ η ≤ 20 % (When <lb/>η ≤ 12 %, C es becomes a negative value at 1.8 K). <lb/>Based on symmetry and some preliminary experimen-<lb/>tal results, Tanaka and Hu [6] proposed spin triplet su-<lb/>perconductivity in the cobalt oxyhydrate. The p-wave <lb/>superconductivity was also suggested by Baskaran [3] for <lb/>the higher doping level. Owing to the ferromagnetic cor-<lb/>relation in the normal state, as stated above, spin-triplet <lb/>p-wave pairing is very probable. Considered the point <lb/>nodes for the superconducting gap, therefore, the gap <lb/>function will be ∆(k)=xk x +ŷk y , which shows the differ-<lb/>ence from the conclusion in the strontium ruthenate su-<lb/>perconductor [22]. Obviously, further experiments such <lb/>as NMR, neutron scattering, and µ SR will be needed to <lb/>make clearer picture for the symmetry of the supercon-<lb/>ducting order parameters. <lb/></body>
