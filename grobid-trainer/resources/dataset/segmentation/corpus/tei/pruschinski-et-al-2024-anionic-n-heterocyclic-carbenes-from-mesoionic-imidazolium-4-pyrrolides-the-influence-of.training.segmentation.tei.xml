Herein, <lb/>mesoionic imidazolium pyrrolides synthesized from pyrrole-2-<lb/>carbaldehyde via various N-alkyl-4-pyrroyl-imidazoles are described. <lb/>These were converted into nine new 4-(pyrrol-2-yl)-substituted <lb/>imidazolium salts and transformed into the mesoionic title <lb/>compounds using an anion exchange resin. The DFT-calculated (B3LYP/6-311++G**) CREF values indicate a great potential <lb/>for the formation of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes by deprotonation, which were generated and reacted with selenium to obtain <lb/>selenoureas. The 77 Se NMR shifts investigated under systematic variation of conditions are dependent on the substitution pattern <lb/>(Δδ Se = 133 ppm) and the steric demand of the substituents. Solvent dependencies of the 77 Se NMR shifts were investigated <lb/>applying toluene-d 8 , THF-d 8 , CDCl 3 , CD 2 Cl 2 , pyridine-d 5 , acetone-d 6 , DMSO-d 6 , CD 3 CN, AcOD, and MeOD. The influences of the <lb/>referencing method on the 77 Se shifts using external or internal Me 2 Se or Ph 2 Se 2 and solvent can add up to Δδ Se = ca. 80 ppm. In <lb/>addition, we observed a temperature dependence of both the selenoureas and the reference reagent Ph 2 Se 2 as well as a 77 Se shift <lb/>difference of the analyte caused by interaction with internally added Ph 2 Se 2 . The negative charge of deprotonated selenoureas shifts <lb/>the values by an additional -20 ppm. <lb/></front>

			<body>■ INTRODUCTION <lb/>Certainly triggered by the isolation of the first stable <lb/>representative of this substance class by Arduengo in 1991, 1 <lb/>intensive research has been carried out in the field of N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) for more than three decades. 2 <lb/>Today, it is impossible to imagine modern synthetic chemistry, <lb/>which applies transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings 3 <lb/>including asymmetric reactions, 4 organocatalytic steps, 5 or <lb/>polymer chemistry 6 without them, to name just a few selected <lb/>subdisciplines of chemistry. In addition, numerous biological <lb/>activities of NHC adducts have been found. 7 In the course of <lb/>this research, interesting structural variations with respect to <lb/>the underlying heterocyclic ring system, different substitution <lb/>patterns and types of carbenes such as normal, abnormal, <lb/>remote NHCs, 8 mesoionic carbenes (MIC) 9 and cyclic alkyl <lb/>amino carbenes (CAAC) 10 have been studied and applied. A <lb/>number of approaches have also been developed to quantify <lb/>the properties of N-heterocyclic carbenes and their precursor <lb/>molecules and thus predict them for customized applications. <lb/>Thus, in order to quantify the ability of heterocyclic precursors <lb/>to form carbenes, the CREF values (carbene relative energy of <lb/>formation) of heterocycles, heteroaromatics and mesomeric <lb/>betaines, which can in principle form N-heterocyclic carbenes <lb/>by deprotonation, were determined. 11 As consequence, various <lb/>methods are available to characterize the electronic properties <lb/>of N-heterocyclic carbenes themselves. These include the <lb/>Tolman parameter (TEP), 12 Huynh parameter, 13 proton <lb/>affinities, molecular electrostatic potentials (MESP), 14 compu-<lb/>tationally derived electronic ligand parameters (CEP), 15 1 J C-H <lb/>and 1 J C-Se coupling constants, and selenium NMR shifts, 18 <lb/>which are used with respect to the π-acceptor and σ-donor <lb/>properties of the resulting NHCs. The basic idea of using 77 Se <lb/>NMR resonance frequencies in this context is that carbenes <lb/>with high σ-donicity lead to selenones in which the 77 Se atom <lb/>is more shielded and therefore an upfield shift of the signals <lb/>occurs, whereas in π-acceptor carbenes the resulting selenones <lb/>are more deshielded and therefore a downfield shift is observed <lb/>(Figure 1). 16-19 <lb/>The literature occasionally mentions that, in addition to the <lb/>structure, the temperature, 17 the pH value, the analyte <lb/>concentration and the solvents also influence the position of <lb/>the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies. 18,19 As can be seen from <lb/>Figure 2, the 77 Se NMR shifts do indeed change with the <lb/>change of solvent in the few examples studied so far. For <lb/>example, the 77 Se NMR signal of 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazole-2-<lb/>selenone I appears at δ = 197 ppm in acetone-d 6 and at δ = 183 <lb/>ppm in deuterated chloroform. In the literature, selenium shifts <lb/></body>

			<body>of selenoureas derived from N-heterocyclic carbenes are found <lb/>in a variety of solvents ranging from CDCl 3 , 20 acetone-d 6 , 21 <lb/>CD 3 CN, 22 THF-d 8 <lb/>23 to DMSO-d 6 . 24 The exchange of <lb/>substituents on the N atoms of the imidazole for substituents <lb/>with different steric requirements and electronic properties <lb/>results in considerable changes in the 77 Se NMR shifts. For <lb/>example, the shift differences when exchanging the tert-butyl <lb/>substituents of I to cyclohexyl (III), whose E s values (Cy = <lb/>-2.03; tBu = -2.78) 25 and A values (Cy: 2.15; tBu: &gt; 4) 25 as a <lb/>measure of steric hindrance differ, are around Δδ = 205 ppm <lb/>into the high field. If Hammett&apos;s σ parameter is used as a <lb/>measure of the electronic properties, the values of the two <lb/>substituents differ only slightly (Cy: σ m = -0.05; σ p = -0.15; <lb/>tBu: σ m : -0.1, σ p : -0.2), 26,27 but it is undoubtedly too simple <lb/>to reduce substituent effects on the 77 Se NMR shifts to the <lb/>parameters captured by these numbers. The aromatic mesityl <lb/>residue on both N atoms causes a resonance frequency at δ = <lb/>27 ppm in deuterated chloroform. The substituents on the <lb/>imidazole ring system, which are located at positions C4 and <lb/>C5, have a further influence. Examples IV and V from Figure 2 <lb/>carry one and two donor substituents, respectively, with <lb/>Hammett values of σ m = +0.12/σ p = -0.37 (OH, respectively) <lb/>and σ m = -0.16/σ p = -0.83 (NMe 2 , respectively), which are <lb/>known to combine inductive, mesomeric and field effects in <lb/>one value, and show different shifts in CDCl 3 around Δδ = 137 <lb/>ppm. <lb/>Overall, the comparison with systems known from the <lb/>literature shows that further systematic examples and data <lb/>obtained from them are still lacking, 12b especially those <lb/>involving charges and conjugation types. Therefore, mesomeric <lb/>betaines are valuable model compounds to study potential <lb/>influences. The aim of our work was therefore to develop new <lb/>mesomeric betaines of imidazole whose anionic structural <lb/>increment is conjugated to the hetarenium ring and thus <lb/>directly influences the potential carbene center. For reasons of <lb/>stability, a heteroaromatic should serve as the anionic <lb/>structural element, which can additionally stabilize the negative <lb/>charge by delocalization. The title compounds, imidazolium-4-<lb/>pyrrolides, appeared to be well suited for this purpose. As <lb/>illustrated in Figure 3, according to the rules of resonance, the <lb/>negative charge delocalizes not only within the anionic pyrrole <lb/>ring, but can also be formulated on C2 and C5 of the imidazole <lb/>ring. This fact, in combination with the characteristic dipole <lb/>increment and the isoconjugate equivalent, defines the <lb/>molecule as a conjugated mesomeric betaine, 28 strictly <lb/>speaking as a mesoionic compound denoting the 5-membered <lb/>rings within this class. 29 Five different classes of mesomeric <lb/>betaines are now distinguished. 30 Of these, the conjugated <lb/>mesomeric betaines are likely to have a particularly significant <lb/>influence on the carbene center via both inductive and <lb/>mesomeric effects. 31 <lb/>Continuing our interest in the chemistry of mesomeric <lb/>betaines 32 and related structures, in particular their ability to <lb/>form N-heterocyclic carbenes and their anionic analogs, 33 we <lb/>report here on the syntheses of the above-mentioned new <lb/>target betaines, on their tendency to carbene formation, and on <lb/>the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies of the selenium adducts <lb/>of these carbenes. <lb/>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>The retrosynthetic analysis indicated that the target betaines <lb/>could best be synthesized from the corresponding imidazolium <lb/>salts, where the imidazolium salts should be prepared by <lb/>quaternization of the corresponding 1,5-disubstituted and <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>1,4,5-trisubstituted imidazoles, which can be synthesized via a <lb/>bismuth(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate-catalyzed van Leusen <lb/>reaction as shown in Scheme 1. 34,37 Thus, starting from <lb/>pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 1, N-alkyl or N-aryl imines 2a-c were <lb/>prepared by reacting the aldehyde with primary amines. In the <lb/>case of the N-alkylimines 2a,b, these were easily prepared by <lb/>adding the corresponding amine to a solution of the aldehyde <lb/>in hexane at room temperature (procedure A). Synthesis of the <lb/>N-aryl imine 2c required the reaction to be carried out in <lb/>methanol under reflux conditions and the addition of catalytic <lb/>amounts of formic acid (procedure B). The formamides 4a-c <lb/>resulted from the reaction of formamide with p-toluenesulfonic <lb/>acid and the corresponding benzaldehydes in the presence of <lb/>TMSCl 34 (method C) and served as starting materials for the <lb/>synthesis of the TosMIC derivatives 5a-c. These were <lb/>prepared easily and with moderate to good yields by <lb/>dehydration using POCl 3 and trimethylamine (procedure <lb/>D). 35 The pyrrole imines 2a-c were then reacted either with <lb/>TosMIC to give 1,5-disubstituted imidazoles or with the <lb/>modified TosMIC derivatives 5a-c to give 1,4,5-trisubstituted <lb/>imidazoles 6a-e. All ring closure reactions were carried out in <lb/>methanol at room temperature using tert-butyl amine as a base, <lb/>with a reaction time of 12 h (procedure E, van Leusen <lb/>reaction). Substitution patterns and yields are summarized in <lb/>Table 1. <lb/>While the syntheses of the N-alkyl imidazoles 5a-e were <lb/>successful, the N-aryl imidazole 5f for the synthesis of 6f could <lb/>not be obtained by this reaction route. In fact, the reaction of <lb/>imine 2c according to the method shown above yielded the <lb/>same imidazole as in the case of imine 2b by an undesired <lb/>transamination reaction (Scheme 2). Such reactions of imines <lb/>in the presence of other amines are known from the <lb/>literature. 36 In order to suppress this, attempts were made, <lb/>albeit unsuccessfully, to carry out the ring closure reaction of <lb/>derivative 2c with potassium carbonate. 36 <lb/>To synthesize the imidazolium salts, the resulting com-<lb/>pounds 6a-e were either N-methylated or N-benzylated <lb/>(Scheme 3). Methylation was carried out in case of 7a with <lb/>Meerwein&apos;s reagent in anhydrous DCM at room temperature <lb/>for 12 h, during which time the salt precipitated (procedure F). <lb/>For the imidazolium salts 7b-d, a reaction with Meerwein&apos;s <lb/>reagent is excluded, as they cannot be dissolved in solvents <lb/>suitable for the reaction. The synthesis was therefore carried <lb/>out in good to almost quantitative yields by reacting the <lb/>imidazoles with excess methyl iodide in dry acetonitrile under <lb/>reflux conditions. The quaternization by benzylation was <lb/>carried out by reaction with the corresponding benzyl <lb/>bromides in anhydrous THF under reflux, and similarly to <lb/>the methylation, the corresponding salts 7e-i were obtained in <lb/>good yields. The imidazolium salts 7a-k were then converted <lb/>to the corresponding mesomeric betaines using the anion <lb/>exchange resin Amberlite IRA 400 in its hydroxide forms. 38 <lb/>This was successful for all derivatives in good to very good <lb/>yields (c.f. Table 2). <lb/>Scheme 1. Synthesis of Imidazoles 6a-e <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>NMR-spectroscopic investigations, which were only possible <lb/>in DMSO-d 6 or CD 3 OD due to the high polarity of the <lb/>betaines investigated, provided no evidence for a betaine-<lb/>carbene tautomerism 7A ↔ 7B (Scheme 4). A similar NMR <lb/>spectroscopic behavior was observed for other imidazole-based <lb/>mesomeric betaines such as quinazolin-4-one imidazolium <lb/>betaines 39 and purine imidazolium betaines. 40 <lb/>The calculated frontier orbital profiles (B3LYP/6-311+ <lb/>+G**) show a characteristic architecture of conjugated <lb/>mesomeric betaines. Typically, the frontier orbitals are <lb/>essentially located in the same parts of the molecule and this <lb/>is undoubtedly valid at least for the calculated HOMOs of the <lb/>betaines (Figure 4). As expected, the anionic pyrrolide ring has <lb/>the larger atomic orbital coefficients in comparison to the <lb/>imidazole ring. It is noteworthy that, according to the <lb/>calculation, the phenyl ring in 7b has hardly any atomic <lb/>orbital coefficients in the HOMO, but strong ones in the <lb/>LUMO despite the torsion angle of τ = 55.7°. On the other <lb/>hand, this matches the LUMO profile of the N-benzylated <lb/>derivative 7h, whose LUMO is mainly localized in the benzene <lb/>ring of the benzyl substituent. The HOMOs have large atomic <lb/>orbital coefficients at the C2 positions of the imidazolium ring <lb/>of the betaines, which form the carbene carbon atoms during <lb/>subsequent deprotonation. <lb/>In order to estimate the ability of the mesoionic compounds <lb/>to form anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes, the CREF (carbene <lb/>relative energy of formation) of the compounds were then <lb/>determined. 11 All CREF values of the imidazolium betaines <lb/>were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level to ensure <lb/>comparison with values from the literature. 11 Surprisingly, the <lb/>CREF values of the derivatives considered in this work (Table <lb/>3) differ only slightly, since the values obtained are apparently <lb/>neither significantly influenced by the substituents at the 4-<lb/>position of the imidazole 7b-7d nor by the different <lb/>substituents at the two nitrogen positions of the imidazole. <lb/>Apparently, they are determined exclusively by the π-character <lb/>of the betainic system. Compared to other anionic imidazole-<lb/>based NHCs which are derived from mesomeric betaines, such <lb/>as 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-4-aminide (CREF = 0.557) 11a or <lb/>1,3-dimethylimidazolium-4-olate (CREF = 0.576), 11a the <lb/>derivatives of this work show lower CREF values, which <lb/>makes them promising carbene precursors among the anionic <lb/>imidazolium-based NHCs. <lb/>The mesomeric betaine 7a was selected as a reference <lb/>compound for base screening to find the optimal conditions <lb/>for the formation of selenourea derivatives of the NHCs <lb/>(Table 4). The best results were obtained by reactions in <lb/>anhydrous MeCN with 2 eq. of cesium carbonate as base <lb/>under reflux at a reaction time of 12 h. All other betaines 8b-<lb/>8i were also converted to selenones 9b-i under these <lb/>conditions. Although the formation of the abnormal carbene <lb/>at the C-5 position of the imidazole is conceivable for R″ = <lb/>H, 41 no products other than those described were obtained <lb/>under the selected conditions. <lb/>In the pdf of the text, it appears as if the syntheses of 8b-8i <lb/>have no conditions (Table 4). Is it possible to visualize this <lb/>graphically so that it is clear that the same conditions apply to <lb/>8a to 8i? Perhaps by drawing a line above 8a and placing the <lb/>conditions in the middle between 8a and 8i? As far as the <lb/>HOMO profiles of the carbenes are concerned, they behave <lb/>similarly to the betaines from which they are formed. First, it <lb/>should be noted that the HOMO of the anionic N-heterocyclic <lb/>carbenes is a π-orbital. Finally, HOMO-2 shows the orbital <lb/>characteristic of carbenes, which lies in the plane of the <lb/>heterocycle. The π-orbital of the HOMO is localized in both <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>parts of the molecule. As in the mesomeric betaine precursor, a <lb/>large atomic orbital coefficient is located on the carbene <lb/>carbon atom (Figure 5). <lb/>In comparison to classical neutral imidazole-based carbenes, <lb/>such as A 33c and B, 16 it is evident that the carbenes of the <lb/>imidazolium-4-pyrrolides described here (F, G) exhibit <lb/>significantly higher HOMO energies. In this regard, these <lb/>compounds inherit a similar behavior to other π-electron-rich <lb/>anionic NHCs, including the sydnones (E), 33c sydnone <lb/>methides (C), 33c imidazole N-ylides (D) 24a and sydnonimines <lb/>(H). 32b (Figure 6). A feature of imidazolium-4-pyrrolides in <lb/>comparison to the aforementioned NHC systems is that, as <lb/>previously mentioned, the HOMO-2 exhibits the conven-<lb/>tional carbene geometry. It should be noted that the <lb/>calculations did not show any coefficients of the LUMO, <lb/>LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 of compounds F and G that would <lb/>allow identification as π-acceptor (Eπ). <lb/>N-Heterocyclic carbenes are known to be good electron <lb/>donors, which is the reason for their broad application in <lb/>chemistry mentioned at the beginning. 2-6 The bonding <lb/>between NHCs and transition metals occurs through σ-and <lb/>π-interactions, which are attempted to be quantified using the <lb/>methods listed in the introduction. 11-18 However, the <lb/>evaluation of the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies appears <lb/>to be complicated. 12b Considering the importance of the 77 Se <lb/>resonance frequencies of selenoureas for the characterization of <lb/>N-heterocyclic carbenes, we first systematically investigated the <lb/>influence of the solvent in order to compare them with the <lb/>results for various other selenium compounds. 42-44 For this <lb/>purpose, the 77 Se NMR shifts of the selenones 9a, 9b, 9e and <lb/>9h were measured in a selection of common NMR solvents of <lb/>different properties. All samples were measured at the same <lb/>temperature. We chose a uniform concentration of 0.17 M <lb/>selenium compound, because results known from the <lb/>literature 42 show that below a concentration of 2.0 M there <lb/>is no concentration dependence of the 77 Se NMR resonance <lb/>frequencies, at least for compounds such as diselenides. 43 We <lb/>also used the measurements of 9a to investigate whether <lb/>different referencing methods have an influence on the 77 Se <lb/>NMR shift. Three recommendations have been made by <lb/>IUPAC regarding the calibration of NMR shifts, and these are <lb/>internal and external referencing and the substitution <lb/>method. 45 Especially in 77 Se NMR spectroscopy, external <lb/>referencing and the substitution method are widely used. 17,42,46 <lb/>The spectra of the compounds mentioned above were <lb/>referenced externally against PhSe-SePh 49 and internally by <lb/>adding SeMe 2 . Since our investigations have shown that the <lb/>77 Se NMR shift of the reference substance PhSe-SePh depends <lb/>on the solvent used, we have decided to always carry out the <lb/>referencing in the same solvent in which the analyte under <lb/>consideration is measured. The signal of the external reference <lb/>is fixed at 461.0 ppm relative to Me-Se-Me @ 0.0 ppm. For <lb/>more detailed information on the behavior of the 77 Se NMR <lb/>shifts of PhSe-SePh in the various solvents, please refer to the <lb/>Supporting Information (Table S1, p. S4). The latter method <lb/>with the toxic SeMe 2 is very unpleasant due to the strong odor. <lb/>Findings on how this reagent can be avoided are therefore <lb/>certainly of particular importance. The values summarized in <lb/>Table 5 are shown graphically in Figure 7. <lb/>First of all, it is noticeable that the reference reagent can <lb/>have an undeniable influence on the determination of the <lb/>chemical shift in 77 Se NMR spectroscopy, but this depends <lb/>strongly on the solvent. The 77 Se NMR signals determined in <lb/>CDCl 3 proved to be particularly sensitive to the referencing <lb/>reagents, which led to widely differing values. In contrast, the <lb/>signals of 9a are unaffected if the measurements are carried out <lb/>in acetone-d 6 , for example. It is known that the 77 Se NMR <lb/>resonance frequency of SeMe 2 depends on the concentration <lb/>(Δδ = 9 ppm from neat to very dilute), on the solvent <lb/>[δ(C 6 H 12 ) -δ(DMSO) &gt; 20 ppm] and on the temperature <lb/>(Δδ = 2.5 ppm above 100 °C), so that a 60% solution of <lb/>dimethylselenide in CDCl 3 was proposed as a suitable <lb/>reference reagent. 47 <lb/>In line with previous results the choice of solvent has a <lb/>considerable influence on the NMR shifts obtained.

			<body>NMR shifts change roughly in parallel and follow a similar <lb/>trend on changing the solvent (Figure 7). This also applies to <lb/>1,3-dimethylimidazole-2-selenone, which we also examined for <lb/>comparison. The measured 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies <lb/>do not correlate with the known empirical parameters for the <lb/>determination of solvent polarity such as the Z-values 50,51 or <lb/>E T <lb/>N values, 50,52 which are listed in Table 5 for information and <lb/>refer to the nondeuterated solvents. The solvent influence on <lb/>the 77 Se NMR shifts cannot be reduced to the parameters that <lb/>are based on the linear free enthalpy relationships to determine <lb/>these solvent polarity scales, and this is consistent with results <lb/>on diselenides, for example. 43 Numerous other classifications <lb/>of solvents exist. Thus, our selection included protic (MeOD) <lb/>and nonprotic, hydrogen bond donating (MeOD) and <lb/>accepting (DMSO, acetone) and π-donating solvents (tol-<lb/>uene). Acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, acetone and DMSO, for <lb/>example, are also more basic than chloroform with <lb/>corresponding Δδ ∞ values of 0.56, 0.79, 0.92, and 1.32 <lb/>respectively. 53 The donor numbers (donicities), which <lb/>describe the nucleophilic properties of electron-pairing <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>solvents, also differ, as can be seen from the normalized D N <lb/>N <lb/>values (MeCN: 14.1 kcal/mol, DMSO: 29.8 kcal/mol). 54 A <lb/>simple correlation between all these classification numbers and <lb/>the observed chemical shifts of 77 Se is not recognizable, which <lb/>is obviously the sum of various influences of different <lb/>weightings. The influence of the substitution pattern on the <lb/>77 <lb/>Se NMR resonance frequencies also does not follow a simple <lb/>pattern in literature examples 43 and the substituent effects are <lb/>not additive in this respect. 48 Based on the results described <lb/>above, we decided to carry out the 77 Se NMR measurements of <lb/>the selenones from this work consistently in DMSO-d 6 , in <lb/>which all compounds are soluble. Table 6 shows the 77 Se NMR <lb/>shifts obtained. With the exception of the derivatives 9h and 9i, <lb/>all 77 Se NMR shifts are in a range between 50.3 and 68.2 ppm, <lb/>with those selenones substituted in the 4-position showing <lb/>slightly higher shifts. The N-benzylated products, on the other <lb/>hand, behave similarly to the methylated selenone 9a. The <lb/>rather high shifts of the derivatives 9h and 9i are surprising; <lb/>this phenomenon has already been observed in other <lb/>publications in connection with tert-butyl or adamantyl <lb/>substituents on the imidazole nitrogen. 21b,55 The reasons for <lb/>this phenomenon do not yet seem to be clearly understood. <lb/>Anisotropy effects, paramagnetic effects and C(sp 3 )-H-Se-<lb/>interactions arising from a negative hyperconjugation between <lb/>the lone pair of selenium and the σ* C-H orbital are being <lb/>discussed in this context. The fact is that DFT calculations <lb/>(B3LYP/6-311++G**) of the energetically most favorable <lb/>structures of 9a,e,h result in planar imidazole rings in all three <lb/>structures, in which the selenium also lies in the same plane, <lb/>despite different steric requirements (Figure 8). The C-Se <lb/>distance is about 1.84 Å in all structures and this distance <lb/>corresponds to that of other selenones. The angle between the <lb/>C-2 position and the nitrogen substituents is also similar in all <lb/>molecules and lies between 123°and 127°. The pyrrole <lb/>substituent is twisted toward the ring plane of the imidazole in <lb/>all derivatives, as is the benzyl substituent in 9e. The sum of <lb/>the van der Waals radii of hydrogen (1.2 Å) 56 and selenium <lb/>(1.9 Å) 57 (Σ = 3.1) is larger than the smallest distance between <lb/>these atoms in 9a (2.98-3.42 Å). In the derivative 9e, the <lb/>nearest proton of the methylene group of the benzyl <lb/>substituent is at a distance of 2.70 Å, while the distance to <lb/>the methyl protons is between 2.82 and 3.63 Å. In the case of <lb/>the N-tert-butyl derivative 9h, two protons of the methyl <lb/>groups have a distance of 2.68 Å and the distance to the <lb/>methylene protons of the benzyl group is 2.62 Å, which are the <lb/>smallest within this series of investigated derivatives. <lb/>Next, we investigated the often-cited temperature depend-<lb/>ence of the 77 Se NMR resonance frequency. 17,43,47,56,58,59 For <lb/>this purpose, two NMR spectra of 9h in CD 3 CN were <lb/>recorded in the range from 15 to 50 °C (Figure 9). Ph 2 Se 2 was <lb/>used as both internal and external reference; Me 2 Se was not <lb/>used as internal reference due to the low vapor pressure of the <lb/>substance. The samples externally referenced to Ph 2 Se 2 at <lb/>461.0 ppm in CD 3 CN at 25 °C relative to Me 2 Se at 0.0 ppm <lb/>show a linear increase in the 77 Se NMR shift with increasing <lb/>temperature, with a rate of change of +0.13 ppm/K with an R 2 <lb/>= 0.999. <lb/>When using Ph 2 Se 2 as an internal standard, where the signal <lb/>of the standard was set to 461 ppm independent of <lb/>temperature, the 77 Se shift of 9h also shows a linear <lb/>dependence, but it is negative at -0.09 ppm/K (R 2 = <lb/>0.993), which can be explained by the temperature depend-<lb/>ence of the standard. Ph 2 Se 2 shows a linear positive 77 Se NMR <lb/>shift of +0.28 ppm/K (Supporting Information, Figure S201, p. <lb/>S206) when it is externally referenced to Ph 2 Se 2 . In our <lb/>analysis of the NMR spectra, we found that the 77 Se NMR shift <lb/>of Ph 2 Se 2 as well as that of 9h in the mixture is shifted <lb/>downfield by 4 ppm compared to the signal of the pure <lb/>standards at the same temperature. This indicates an <lb/>interaction of the internal standard with the analyte. To <lb/>confirm this assumption, we performed another NMR <lb/>experiment in a coaxial NMR tube using a mixture of Ph 2 Se 2 <lb/>and 9h in a 1:1 ratio in the outer chamber and only the <lb/>standard in the inner tube. Two 77 Se NMR resonance <lb/>frequencies were detected for the Ph 2 Se 2 , which were offset <lb/>Figure 7. 77 Se NMR chemical shift changes in different solvents. <lb/>Solvents were sorted in the order of ascending 77 Se shift values. <lb/>Table 6.

			<body>from each other by 4 ppm, as previously observed (Supporting <lb/>Information, Figure S202, p. S207). Based on these results, it <lb/>can be assumed that an interaction with the analyte occurs <lb/>when at least Ph 2 Se 2 is used as the internal standard. Internally <lb/>and externally referenced samples can therefore not be readily <lb/>compared. Since we have already observed a considerable <lb/>dependence of the 77 Se resonance frequency on the solvent <lb/>used, we were also interested in whether standard analyt <lb/>interactions are also dependent on the solvent. We therefore <lb/>measured a sample of selenoureas 9h and 9e in chloroform and <lb/>referenced it once internally and once externally against <lb/>Ph 2 Se 2 , as this is probably the most frequently used solvent for <lb/>77 Se NMR measurements. The 77 Se resonance frequencies of <lb/>these measurements show no deviation, from which it can be <lb/>concluded that the previously observed interactions are also <lb/>solvent dependent. <lb/>Finally, to study the influence of a negatively charged <lb/>pyrrolide substituent on the NMR resonance frequencies, <lb/>selenone 9a was deprotonated in situ in an NMR tube to yield <lb/>the anion 10a. Thus, 0.25 to 2 equiv of potassium tert-butoxide <lb/>were added in portions to a sample of 9a in DMSO-d 6 and the <lb/>1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 77 Se NMR shifts of the sample were <lb/>measured. During deprotonation, it was observed that the 1 H <lb/>NMR signals of the pyrrole and imidazole ring undergo <lb/>highfield shifts as expected (Figure 10) and a similar, albeit less <lb/>pronounced, effect can also be seen in the 13 C NMR spectrum. <lb/>Position 4 of the imidazole displayed the strongest change by <lb/>0.45 ppm in the 1 H NMR spectrum which is in accord with the <lb/>delocalization of the negative charge within the conjugated <lb/>anion 10a.

			<body>evidence of deprotonation of the C5 position was obtained <lb/>when base was added to compound 9a, indicating that no <lb/>abnormal carbene is formed under the chosen conditions. <lb/>Therefore, the signal of the methyl group at N1 also shifts to a <lb/>higher field. As the methyl group at N3 forms a hydrogen bond <lb/>to the nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring, its signal shifts to <lb/>lower field, as it is now fixed in the plane of the pyrrole ring <lb/>and anisotropy effects occur. The 77 Se NMR signal shifts by <lb/>20.3 ppm from 52.1 pmm to 31.8 ppm during this <lb/>deprotonation. Results of the NMR titration are shown in <lb/>Figure S181 (Supporting Information). For the same reason, <lb/>protons of the phenyl ring of 10b undergo a strong high-field <lb/>shift. Similar 77 Se NMR shifts are observed with 9e and 9b, <lb/>whose values are shifted by 19 and 17 ppm into the high field. <lb/>To the best of our knowledge, these are the first values that <lb/>quantify the influence of negative charges of substituents <lb/>conjugated to imidazole by 77 Se NMR spectroscopy. A <lb/>graphical and comparative compilation of the NMR shift <lb/>differences during deprotonation can be found in the <lb/>Supporting Material (Figures S180, S181, S188, S189, S196, <lb/>and S197). After the addition of 2 eq. KOt-Bu, we were able to <lb/>detect an additional signal in the 1 H NMR spectrum with a <lb/>resonance frequency of 3.6 ppm. It can be assumed that this is <lb/>probably water that has entered the sample during the addition <lb/>of the base, which was not dried beforehand, or from the <lb/>environment. The measured spectra of compound 9a show <lb/>that this signal is not related to the analyte. <lb/>Comparing the 77 Se NMR shifts of the selenium adducts <lb/>described here with those of other N-heterocyclic imidazole <lb/>compounds such as 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazole-2-<lb/>s e l e n o n e ( δ 7 7 S e = -1 8 p p m ) , 2 1 b 4 , 5 -b i s ( 1 , 3 -<lb/>diisopropylphenyl)imidazole-2-selenone (δ 77 Se = 87 ppm), 21b <lb/>1,3-diadamantylimidazole-2-selenone (δ 77 Se = 197 ppm) 21b <lb/>and 1,3-bis(1,3,5-trimethylphenyl)-2-selenoxoimidazolidine-<lb/>4,5-dione (δ 77 Se = 856 ppm), 18 one can speak of moderate <lb/>π-acceptor properties of our molecules on the basis of the <lb/>previous opinion on the significance of the 77 Se shifts, which is <lb/>not surprising considering their π-electron density. This is <lb/>consistent with the shift differences when the selenoureas are <lb/>converted from the neutral to the anionic form. Based on our <lb/>observations of the electronic structure of betaine and <lb/>deprotonated selenourea, an application of the systems <lb/>shown here in transition metal catalysis is conceivable. The <lb/>betaines represent π-electron-rich systems which, depending <lb/>on the choice of conditions, could also be used as anionic <lb/>ligands. 60a,b In addition, due to the synthesis used, the betaines <lb/>could be easily modified and thus adapted to the requirements <lb/>of catalysis. A further modification of the N-position of the <lb/>pyrrole also seems possible. 60 <lb/>■ CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In summary, using new mesoionic compounds with an <lb/>imidazolium and a pyrrolide building block, a systematic <lb/>investigation of factors for 77 Se NMR shifts used in the <lb/>literature to estimate the electronic properties of N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes such as σ-donor and π-acceptor <lb/>properties is presented here. These mesoionic compounds <lb/>can be effectively prepared via a four-step synthesis and show <lb/>promising CREF values of about 0.546 for estimating the <lb/>formation tendency of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes by <lb/>deprotonation. These values obviously do not include N1-, <lb/>N3-and C4-substituent influences because the values of the <lb/>different substitution patterns of the model compounds are <lb/>very similar. Rather, the π-character of the mesoionic basic <lb/>system is dominant. The HOMOs of the anionic N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes are π-orbitals originating in mesoionic <lb/>compounds. As expected, systematic studies of the 77 Se NMR <lb/>resonance frequencies of the selenourea derivatives of the <lb/>corresponding NHCs show dependencies on the substitution <lb/>pattern, with the tert.-butyl derivative causing sudden down-<lb/>field shifts to ca. 183 ppm, consistent with literature <lb/>observations. We were able to systematically investigate the <lb/>solvent dependence often cited in the literature on our model <lb/>systems and found a parallelism of the solvent-induced shift <lb/>differences and the respective substitution patterns, whereby <lb/>the order of the solvents to visualize this parallelism does not <lb/>follow any simple property relationships such as the solvent <lb/>polarity, the donicity or the basicity of the solvents. However, <lb/>the temperature dependence can be quantified very well. We <lb/>were also able to show that the referencing method (Me 2 Se vs. <lb/>PhSe-SePh) can, but does not necessarily have to, have a <lb/>profound influence on the 77 Se NMR shifts determined, <lb/>depending on the NMR solvent. For example, measurements <lb/>in CDCl 3 react particularly sensitively to the type of <lb/>referencing, whereas no influence could be detected for <lb/>measurements in acetone-d 6 for the molecules described <lb/>here. The effects of the charges on the 77 Se NMR shifts are <lb/>described here for the first time. Negative charges delocalized <lb/>in the π-system of heteroaromatics lead to highfield shifts of <lb/>the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies between -20.2 ppm and <lb/>-17.6 ppm, depending on the substitution pattern of the <lb/>underlying ring system. These results will be useful for anyone <lb/>using 77 Se NMR values of selenium adducts to estimate the <lb/>electronic properties of N-heterocyclic carbenes <lb/>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>General Remarks. All commercially available chemicals were used <lb/>without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. Anhydrous <lb/>solvents were dried according to standard procedures (acetonitrile) or <lb/>purchased from a MP5 Solvent Purification System of the company <lb/>Inert Technology (diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran). The reactions were <lb/>traced by thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed on 60 F254 <lb/>sillica-coated aluminum plates from Merck and visualized using UV <lb/>light (254 nm). The preparative column chromatography was <lb/>conducted through silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) of the company <lb/>Merck. For the ion-exchange column chromatography the exchange <lb/>resin Amberlite IRA-400(Cl) from Alfa Aesar was used. The 1 H and <lb/>13 C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz <lb/>spectrometer (at 600.35 MHz for 1 H NMR, 150.96 MHz for 13 C <lb/>NMR), and a Bruker Avance Neo 400 MHz spectrometer (at 400.23 <lb/>MHz for 1 H NMR, 100.64 MHz for 13 C NMR). 77 Se spectra were <lb/>measured with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer (at 114.50 <lb/>MHz for 77 Se) and referenced externally to dimethyl selenide or <lb/>internally by addition of Me 2 Se, as indicated. NMR solvent peaks <lb/>were used as the internal reference, all solvents were obtained from <lb/>Deutero GmbH. Multiplicities are described by using the following <lb/>abbreviations: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = <lb/>multiplet. Signal orientations in DEPT experiments were described as <lb/>follows: o = no signal; + = up (CH, CH 3 ); -= down (CH 2 ). 1 H NMR <lb/>coupling constants are mentioned in Hz. The ATR-IR spectra were <lb/>measured with a Bruker Alpha in the range of 400 to 4000 cm -1 . The <lb/>electrospray ionization mass spectra were measured with a Bruker <lb/>Impact II mass spectrometer, spraying the samples from methanol. <lb/>Melting points were determined in an apparatus according to Dr. <lb/>Tottoli (Buchi) and are uncorrected. The compounds 2a, 61 2b, 62 <lb/>2c, 62 4a, 35a 4b, 63 4c, 63 and 5a-c 35a were prepared according to <lb/>literature procedures. <lb/>General Procedure for the Synthesis of Imidazoles (Procedure E). <lb/>In a round-bottom flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, 1 eq. of <lb/></body>
