			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Among women, invasive breast cancer is the most commonly <lb/>diagnosed female cancer in most countries worldwide. 1 Increased <lb/>mammographic breast density, which describes the radiologically <lb/>appearing white tissue on a mammogram, is one of the strongest <lb/>breast cancer risk factors 2 . A recent meta-analysis found that <lb/>percent density, which reflects the proportion of total breast area <lb/>comprised of dense fibroglandular tissue, is a stronger predictor of <lb/>risk than absolute dense area. 3 It is estimated that 43% of US <lb/>women 40-74 years of age have dense breasts, 4 but mechanisms <lb/>accounting for the relationship between elevated density and <lb/>breast cancer risk remain ill-defined. <lb/>Studies highlight that pre-cancerous lesions 5 and breast <lb/>tumors 6 are more likely to occur in mammographically dense <lb/>regions within the breast, suggesting the relevance of localized as <lb/>well as global density measures in cancer development. The few <lb/>studies that have examined histological correlates of breast <lb/>density have suggested that higher breast density is associated <lb/>with greater epithelial cell content and non-fatty stroma. 7,8 While <lb/>most studies to date have utilized quantitative microscopy to <lb/>characterize breast tissue from women undergoing procedures for <lb/>suspect lesions, one study of non-cancerous autopsy breast tissues <lb/>also showed positive relationships between epithelial and non-<lb/>fatty stromal tissue, particularly stromal collagen area, and percent <lb/>density. 9 <lb/>Advancements in automated digital pathology now allow <lb/>increased opportunities for characterization and quantification of <lb/>breast tissue organization that can complement traditional <lb/>microscopic assessments. Moreover, increasingly, studies are <lb/>utilizing automated digital tools for complex tissue pathology <lb/>assessment of breast cancer outcomes. 10,11 The recent incorpora-<lb/>tion of progressive artificial intelligence platforms into digital <lb/>pathology work systems now allows the utilization and expansion <lb/>of these approaches to larger scale molecular epidemiological <lb/>studies. Specifically, deep learning methods such as convolutional <lb/>neural networks, 12 are increasingly being employed for histologi-<lb/>cal image recognition with high accuracy and reproducibility. 13-15 <lb/>We previously developed a deep learning convolutional neural <lb/>network model for the assessment of tissue characteristics in <lb/></body>

			<body>hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide breast tissue <lb/>images, 16,17 which classified whole slide images as epithelial, <lb/>stromal and fat tissue. In this current study, we hypothesized that <lb/>application of this model to whole slide images of H&amp;E-stained <lb/>fixed tissue specimens collected from diagnostic image-guided <lb/>breast biopsies might enable identification of specific histologic <lb/>correlates that underpin breast density, including both global and <lb/>localized (peri-lesional) measures. Secondly, as more than 25 <lb/>million women in the US have dense breasts, 4 and because only a <lb/>small proportion of these women will develop breast cancer, we <lb/>also aimed to identify tissue correlates of breast density that may <lb/>be important for distinguishing malignant from benign biopsy <lb/>diagnoses separately among women with high and low breast <lb/>density, to help inform cancer risk stratification among women <lb/>undergoing a biopsy following an abnormal mammogram. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Patient characteristics <lb/>Overall, patient characteristics were largely similar between the <lb/>training (n = 588) and testing (n = 264) sets (Table 1). The mean <lb/>age was 50 years, and most women were of white race (91.3%), <lb/>college educated (82.3%), of normal weight (50.4%) and <lb/>premenopausal (58.1%). Most mammograms were categorized <lb/>after work-up as suspicious abnormality (BI-RADS diagnostic <lb/>category 4: 83.7%). The remainder were categorized as probably <lb/>benign (BI-RADS diagnostic category 3: 5.9%) or highly suggestive <lb/>of malignancy (BI-RADS diagnostic category 5: 10.5%). A little over <lb/>half of the core needle biopsies were ultrasound-guided (54.6%), <lb/>with the remainder being stereotactic-guided (45.3%). Median <lb/>global fibroglandular volume was 34.4%, and median localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume was 40.0%. No difference was observed for <lb/>global and localized fibroglandular volume between the training <lb/>and testing sets. Among the n = 1036 biopsy targets, most biopsy <lb/>diagnoses were benign (78.2%). Benign breast disease diagnoses <lb/>were categorized according to benign non-proliferative (including <lb/>non-proliferative fibrocystic change and other benign and discrete <lb/>entities), proliferative without atypia (including ductal hyperplasia <lb/>and sclerosing adenosis) and proliferative with atypia (including <lb/>atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia). Further, 8.0% of all <lb/>biopsies yielded in-situ lesions, and 13.8% were invasive <lb/>carcinoma (Table 1). <lb/>Associations between histologic features and breast density <lb/>(global and localized fibroglandular volume) <lb/>As mentioned in the methods, 37 features were extracted from <lb/>the output of the convolutional neural network model. Using <lb/>these identified features in separate random forest regression <lb/>models trained to predict global and localized fibroglandular <lb/>volume, the correlations between predicted and actual fibro-<lb/>glandular volume measurements were 0.94 for global and 0.93 <lb/>for localized fibroglandular volume, respectively. The top 10 <lb/>correlates identified as most important for predicting both <lb/>fibroglandular volume measurements are shown in Table 2, and <lb/>the corresponding Gini index plots for global and localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. <lb/>Overall, similar features were identified as correlates of global <lb/>and localized fibroglandular volume measures; however, some <lb/>differences were noted. Normalized non-fatty stromal tissue <lb/>quantity (i.e., stromal tissue quantity normalized to total breast <lb/>tissue area on the whole slide image) and normalized fat <lb/>quantity (i.e., fat tissue quantity normalized to breast tissue area <lb/>on the whole slide image) were the strongest predictors of both <lb/>global and localized fibroglandular volume. Of note, epithelium <lb/>quantity did not rank among the top 10 features for global <lb/>fibroglandular volume and was ranked 8th for localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume. Features characterizing the spatial <lb/>arrangement of the epithelial regions assessed using an area-<lb/>Voronoi diagram 18,19 were among the top 10 features ranked for <lb/>prediction of both global and localized fibroglandular volume. <lb/>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence <lb/>of body mass index (BMI) and menopausal status on the <lb/>predictions, and results from these investigations are detailed <lb/>in Supplementary Table 2. BMI was consistently ranked as the <lb/>strongest predictor of fibroglandular volume when included in <lb/>the model. Interestingly, in this model, the normalized fat <lb/>quantity was the next most important feature for both global <lb/>and localized fibroglandular volume, followed by normalized <lb/>non-fatty stroma quantity. When analyses were stratified by <lb/>menopausal status, some differences in top ranking features <lb/>were noted as outlined in Supplementary Table 2. For global <lb/>fibroglandular volume prediction, the top-ranked features were <lb/>similar; however, for localized fibroglandular volume, fat-related <lb/>variables ranked lower among postmenopausal women than for <lb/>premenopausal women. <lb/>Exploratory investigation relating histologic features to biopsy <lb/>diagnosis among patients with high and low fibroglandular <lb/>volume <lb/>As elevated breast density is common among women, 4 yet only a <lb/>small proportion will develop invasive breast cancer, we aimed to <lb/>identify histological correlates that could inform future breast <lb/>cancer risk stratification among women undergoing diagnostic <lb/>biopsy with either high or low breast density. The main objective <lb/>of this exploratory investigation was to examine if the histologic <lb/>features that were associated with cancer status were similar and/ <lb/>or different among women with low vs. high fibroglandular <lb/>volume. Thus, using the 37 features, a random forest classifier was <lb/>trained to predict invasive cancer vs. benign breast disease among <lb/>women stratified into high or low fibroglandular volume (using <lb/>the median cut-point of global (34.4%) and localized (40%) <lb/>fibroglandular volume from the training population). The top-<lb/>ranked features for predicting invasive cancer status separately <lb/>among women with high vs. low fibroglandular volume are shown <lb/>in Table 3. Firstly, features associated with the spatial arrange-<lb/>ments of the epithelial regions were ranked most important (top <lb/>two features) for predicting cancer status among women, <lb/>irrespective of global fibroglandular volume (Table 3). H&amp;E images <lb/>highlighting examples of the top-ranked epithelial region spatial <lb/>arrangement features, with corresponding mammograms from <lb/>patients whose biopsies yielded diagnoses of atypical ductal <lb/>hyperplasia and invasive carcinoma, are shown in Fig. 2a, b, <lb/>respectively. Despite similar radiological global fibroglandular <lb/>volume on both mammograms, the H&amp;Es from each diagnostic <lb/>biopsy, targeted to locally dense regions within the breast, reflect <lb/>differences in the spatial arrangement of epithelium (Fig. 2a, b). <lb/>Within Fig. 2, two features are highlighted: the mean and median <lb/>area ratio of each epithelial region to its Voronoi region. Figure 2a <lb/>represents a H&amp;E whole slide image with low mean and median <lb/>area ratio of each epithelial region to its Voronoi region. This slide <lb/>has a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia and has both global <lb/>and localized fibroglandular volume &gt; median (global fibrogland-<lb/>ular volume: 45%; localized fibroglandular volume: 61%). In <lb/>contrast, Fig. 2b represents a H&amp;E whole slide image with higher <lb/>mean and median area ratio of each epithelial region to its <lb/>Voronoi. This slide has a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma and has <lb/>both global and localized fibroglandular volume &gt; median (global <lb/>fibroglandular volume: 49%; localized fibroglandular volume: <lb/>49%). Features of epithelial regions were also strongly associated <lb/>with invasive cancer status in models stratified by localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume. Among women with high localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume, epithelial morphology features ranked as <lb/>the most important (4 out of the top 5). Among women with low <lb/>localized fibroglandular volume, epithelium quantity and the <lb/></body>

			<body>median number of epithelial regions were the top two ranked <lb/>features, followed by normalized stroma quantity. <lb/>The performance of the model for predicting invasive cancer <lb/>among women with high vs. low global fibroglandular volume in <lb/>the testing set is shown in Fig. 3a, b. An AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: <lb/>0.80-0.99) was achieved for predicting invasive cancer diagnosis <lb/>among women with high global fibroglandular volume, and an <lb/>AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.94) was reached for predicting an <lb/>invasive cancer diagnosis among women with low global <lb/>fibroglandular volume. For cancer detection stratified according <lb/>to high and low localized fibroglandular volume, similar predic-<lb/>tion values were observed, as shown in Fig. 3c, d (high localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume: AUC: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.79-0.99); low <lb/>localized fibroglandular volume: AUC: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.65-0.96)). <lb/>No significant differences were observed between the AUCs for <lb/>high vs. low global (p = 0.24) or localized fibroglandular volume <lb/>(p = 0.24). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>We report that we can predict global and local mammographic <lb/>fibroglandular volume by applying a deep convolutional neural <lb/>network model to H&amp;E-stained sections of image-guided breast <lb/>biopsies prompted by an abnormal mammogram. Specifically, we <lb/>show that greater non-fatty stromal and adipose tissue content <lb/>and the spatial distribution of epithelial regions in tissues, rather <lb/>than total epithelial quantities, were the strongest correlates of % <lb/>fibroglandular volume. The cardinal histopathologic feature of <lb/>breast cancer on low magnification is &apos;invasion&apos;, characterized by <lb/>irregular epithelial growth with incursion of cells into normal <lb/>structures. As anticipated, features extracted from the output of <lb/>the convolutional neural network indicated that epithelial <lb/>organization is the strongest correlate of invasive cancer <lb/>irrespective of fibroglandular volume.

A novel finding of our <lb/>study was the identification of the spatial arrangement of <lb/>epithelial regions as ranking among the top 10 correlates of <lb/>fibroglandular volume. To define spatial arrangements, we used <lb/>an area-Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation, which are <lb/>approaches that would be very difficult to reproduce using visual <lb/>assessment. Voronoi decomposition is a method whereby an area <lb/>is partitioned into smaller areas that surround regions that are <lb/>closest to pre-specified points. 19,21 In essence, our results suggest <lb/>that tissues that display a high ratio of epithelial area to its <lb/>corresponding areas of influence are characteristic of cancer in <lb/>both high and low global fibroglandular volume contexts. The <lb/>identified Voronoi area along with the area ratio of each epithelial <lb/>region to its Voronoi region ranked among the top 10 correlates <lb/>for both global and localized fibroglandular volume measures. <lb/>Beck and colleagues were among the first to highlight the <lb/>potential of digital image analysis for examining histological <lb/>features of breast cancer. They developed and utilized C-Path <lb/>(Computational Pathologist), a machine learning tool, which <lb/>identified features of stromal morphology that were especially <lb/>important for predicting breast cancer prognosis. 10 Although <lb/>prognosis was not the focus of our analyses, using a similar <lb/>approach, we also found that the quantity of non-fatty breast <lb/>stromal tissue was among the top-ranked predictors of fibro-<lb/>glandular volume, supporting the contributory role of stroma to <lb/>fibroglandular volume. This study highlights the importance of <lb/>examining the tissue microenvironment of dense tissue in more <lb/>detail, including conducting in-depth analysis of stromal compo-<lb/>nents 17 including collagen. 22,23 <lb/>A major clinical challenge is differentiating between the non-<lb/>fatty stroma and at-risk epithelium that together constitute the <lb/>&apos;white&apos; dense areas that appear on a mammogram. Thus, despite <lb/>similar measures of breast density for a radiologically dense <lb/>breast, there could be considerable heterogeneity of tissue <lb/>composition within the dense regions. As density alone may not <lb/>be capable of defining epithelial organization, other techniques <lb/>are needed. Potential solutions could be alternative imaging or <lb/>further classification of density using neural networks. 20 Findings <lb/>from our exploratory analysis relating histologic correlates to <lb/>biopsy diagnosis highlight the interindividual heterogeneity that <lb/>may be apparent at the histological level despite having <lb/>comparable radiological densities. Interestingly, we found that <lb/>irrespective of fibroglandular volume, spatial arrangement of <lb/>epithelium was the most predictive of a cancer diagnosis, showing <lb/>that deciphering composition of the mammographic fibrogland-<lb/>ular volume is important for identifying abnormalities at the <lb/>histological level. Of note, the performance of the model was <lb/>better in detecting cancer status among women with high <lb/>fibroglandular volume (both global and localized) than among <lb/>women with low fibroglandular volume, though this difference <lb/>was not statistically significant. This could be an artifact of the <lb/>model, i.e., a challenge of recognizing spatial patterns in low <lb/>density. However, this finding could also support the concept of <lb/>epithelial-stromal interaction in the progression of invasive cancer. <lb/>Understanding the heterogeneity 24 and significance of the <lb/>epithelial region spatial arrangement and organization may <lb/>provide important etiological clues for tumorigenesis, and <lb/>additional assessment of these features is needed to examine <lb/>their relationships with other epithelial histological risk markers <lb/>including terminal duct lobular units. 25 <lb/>Since the publication by Beck and colleagues, there have been <lb/>substantial advancements in digital pathology methodology, <lb/>particularly with the advent of deep learning. For example, our <lb/>investigation complements and expands on existing studies that <lb/>have highlighted the potential of deep learning for identifying <lb/>factors associated with breast cancer diagnosis. 14,15,26-28 The <lb/>publication of the CAMELYON16 challenge winners showed the <lb/>ability of deep learning algorithms to detect lymph node <lb/>metastasis with high accuracy with a comparable AUC to that <lb/>obtained following pathological assessment (AUC = 0.96). 15 While <lb/>our limited sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study <lb/>design prevented detailed investigation of features associated <lb/>with breast biopsy diagnoses, our preliminary findings also <lb/>support the need for further investigations of biopsy tissue using <lb/>deep learning algorithms. <lb/>This study has many important clinical implications and <lb/>considerations.

			<body>feature assessment alone and without the inclusion of additional <lb/>breast cancer risk factor information suggests the utility of deep <lb/>learning approaches for the clinical setting. However, to investi-<lb/>gate potential influences of patient characteristics, we conducted <lb/>sensitivity analyses. As expected given its well-established strong <lb/>inverse association with % fibroglandular volume, 29 BMI was the <lb/>highest ranked feature for predicting % fibroglandular volume for <lb/>models in which it was included. While recognition of clinical and <lb/>participant characteristics is important, the inclusion of such <lb/>factors in analytical models may mask lesser associations <lb/>identified by the random forest approach. Second, clinically <lb/>relevant histological features of biopsy tissue accompanied with <lb/>radiological information may be of benefit to integrate into breast <lb/>cancer risk models, 30 which are increasingly being used in clinical <lb/>practice for determining risk of invasive breast cancer. Our <lb/>findings are of particular relevance for women with elevated <lb/>breast density, who have had a prior breast biopsy, and as such <lb/>are at elevated risk of developing invasive breast cancer. We aim <lb/>that by identifying validated histological features at the time of <lb/>clinical biopsy following an abnormal mammogram, we may be <lb/>able to discriminate women at highest risk. Increased efforts are <lb/>ongoing to include histological information, as well as mammo-<lb/>graphic density, in risk prediction tools as evidenced by the BCSC-<lb/>BBD model. 31 However, these current risk models do not yet <lb/>incorporate detailed histology in risk estimates. The integration of <lb/>biopsy histological features to current risk models that assess <lb/>radiological and risk factor information may ultimately improve <lb/>risk assessment and inform clinical management strategies by <lb/>providing additional risk information on the increasing number of <lb/>women undergoing breast biopsies after a mammogram. <lb/>Furthermore, the application of deep learning models that can <lb/>utilize histological breast biopsy features to predict future risk of <lb/>breast cancer among women with dense breasts will be important <lb/>among the growing population of women who experience an <lb/>initial benign breast biopsy diagnosis. Future expanded studies <lb/>will address these questions. <lb/>Our study has many strengths. Firstly, this analysis is one of the <lb/>largest breast tissue studies to date to apply convolutional neural <lb/>network models for the identification of tissue correlates of <lb/>mammographic breast density. Further, from a biological mechan-<lb/>istic perspective, the ability to examine relationships between <lb/>breast tissue features and localized fibroglandular volume <lb/>measures allows the additional assessment of characteristics of <lb/>the microenvironment of the suspect lesion, particularly factors <lb/>that cannot be quantified by visual assessment but that may be <lb/>important markers of cancer. Of note, we observed similarities in <lb/>the top identified histologic correlates of both global and localized <lb/>% fibroglandular volume, supporting the utility of biopsy tissues in <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>understanding the global breast milieu. Further strengths of this <lb/>study included the use of deep learning for delineating <lb/>characteristics of tissue organization as well as for quantification <lb/>of tissue components. Additionally, the utilization of diagnostic <lb/>H&amp;E whole slide images supports investigations of samples that <lb/>are routinely collected during the clinical investigation following a <lb/>biopsy, which suggests this approach may have clinical applic-<lb/>ability and could compliment routine diagnostic assessment. This <lb/>study related volumetric measures of breast density, determined <lb/>from FFDM images, to 2D histological images from FFPE tissues, <lb/>providing an important step toward a novel and complex <lb/>approach to understanding breast cancer lesions and their <lb/>relationships with breast density. Additional understanding of <lb/>volumetric breast density would be gained by examining the 3D <lb/>architecture of the BBD and breast cancer diagnoses. For example, <lb/>future studies that incorporate volumetric density measures from <lb/>3D imaging modalities along with fresh tissues will provide a <lb/>complementary extension to these findings. <lb/>However, this study also has limitations. While random forest <lb/>approaches are effective in deciphering which histological <lb/>features contribute most to model prediction, they do not yield <lb/>easily quantifiable results for strengths of association. Our <lb/>investigation of deep learning approaches to identify histologic <lb/>features associated with cancer among women with high versus <lb/>low breast density, while promising, was hampered by sample <lb/>size. In our current sample set, the number of cancer cases within <lb/>the testing dataset was limited in order to maximize the reliability <lb/>of model training. Thus, additional, larger prospective studies are <lb/>needed to identify biomarkers for cancer risk stratification among <lb/>women with high breast density who may be referred to <lb/>diagnostic biopsy following an abnormal mammogram. While <lb/>the BREAST-Stamp participants are a representative sample of the <lb/>population of women undergoing diagnostic investigation after <lb/>an abnormal breast imaging exam, the women enrolled within the <lb/>study were primarily white (91.3%), which is reflective of the <lb/>catchment area of the University of Vermont Cancer Center. <lb/>Further, detailed information on lifestyle factors including alcohol <lb/>consumption and smoking were not available for the full study <lb/>population in this analysis. Thus, additional studies among more <lb/>diverse populations are warranted to determine the general-<lb/>izability of study findings and to determine whether tissue <lb/>correlates of mammographic density vary by race and also by <lb/>lifestyle breast cancer risk factors. In addition, our analysis was <lb/>restricted to H&amp;E-stained tissue sections. While using H&amp;E sections <lb/>is important as they are clinically meaningful and routinely <lb/>prepared following biopsy, investigation of features associated <lb/>with complementary histological stains to characterize the breast <lb/>microenvironment may also be informative. An additional <lb/>consideration is the applicability of this approach to other <lb/>populations. This investigation included breast tissue sections <lb/>from a single cross-sectional study, for which standardized <lb/>protocols were followed for specimen preparation, tissue section-<lb/>ing and staining, and were completed in the same laboratory at <lb/>the University of Vermont Medical Center. While this rigorous <lb/>methodology reduced potential variability in the tissue samples <lb/>being assessed, it may limit the generalizability of the findings. <lb/>The approach applied in this current study used extensive contrast <lb/>and color augmentation during training. This method increases <lb/>the robustness of the deep learning model against staining <lb/>variations, but may not be sufficient when dealing with external <lb/>datasets with significant staining variations. Therefore, additional <lb/>validation studies are needed that include tissue sections <lb/>prepared in multiple laboratories. Such studies would be highly <lb/>informative for determining the robustness of deep learning <lb/>within diverse pathological clinical settings. <lb/>In conclusion, we highlight the potential of applying convolu-<lb/>tional neural network models to digital pathology to gain insights <lb/>into histological correlates that correspond to radiologic measures <lb/>of breast fibroglandular volume, and to cancer risk. In doing so, in <lb/>a population of women undergoing diagnostic breast biopsy, we <lb/>found that epithelial organization was the strongest correlate of <lb/>invasive cancer irrespective of fibroglandular volume. In addition, <lb/>we found in agreement with prior studies that fat and non-fatty <lb/>stromal features were important determinants of radiologic <lb/>fibroglandular volume. As radiologic density alone may not be <lb/>capable of defining epithelial organization, these findings suggest <lb/>opportunities for future efforts using neural networks for <lb/>enhanced capture of novel histologic as well as breast imaging <lb/>features that may advance our understanding of breast <lb/>tumorigenesis. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study population <lb/>This study included women referred for diagnostic image-guided breast <lb/>biopsy after an abnormal breast imaging exam between October 2007 and <lb/>June 2010 at the University of Vermont Medical Center, and were enrolled as <lb/>part of the National Cancer Institute&apos;s (NCI) cross-sectional, molecular <lb/>epidemiologic Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST)-<lb/>Stamp Project. Details of the BREAST Stamp Project and study eligibility <lb/>characteristics have been described previously. 25,29,32 Eligible participants <lb/>were women aged 40-65 years referred for image-guided biopsy who did <lb/>not have breast implants, had not been diagnosed with breast cancer or <lb/>received cancer treatments, had not undergone breast surgery within one <lb/>year and had not received chemoprevention. During the enrollment period, <lb/>mammography registry data indicated that 1227 patients met these <lb/>eligibility criteria. Information supplied by the radiology facility included <lb/>final assessment of the mammogram, in BI-RADS categories: 3, &quot;probably <lb/>benign finding&quot;; 4, &quot;suspicious abnormality&quot;; and 5, &quot;highly suggestive of <lb/>malignancy&quot;. 33 A standard health history questionnaire which assessed <lb/>established breast cancer risk factors was collected at the time of the <lb/>mammogram, 34 and upon providing consent to be enrolled in the study, <lb/>additional detailed breast cancer risk factor information was collected by the <lb/>research coordinator. 29 The distribution of the collected breast cancer risk <lb/>factor information, including the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of <lb/>the enrolled BREAST Stamp study population, has been previously <lb/>described. 25,29,32 Details of the analytical population included in this current <lb/>analysis are outlined in more detail below and described in Table 1. The <lb/>Institutional Review Boards at the NCI and the University of Vermont <lb/>approved the protocol for this project for either active consenting or a waiver <lb/>of consent to enroll participants, link data and perform analytical studies. <lb/>Breast biopsy specimens <lb/>Breast tissues obtained from ultrasound-guided core needle (14-gauge) or <lb/>stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted (9-gauge) biopsy, were routinely <lb/>processed, and representative H&amp;E-stained breast tissue sections were <lb/>obtained from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded target blocks for each <lb/>biopsy and, when collected during biopsy, from non-target blocks <lb/>representing surrounding non-target tissue. The diagnosis was confirmed <lb/>following pathological report review. For women who had ≥ two unilateral <lb/>biopsy targets, the two targets with the most severe diagnoses were <lb/>Fig. 1 Workflow overview utilizing training and testing sets for the <lb/>prediction of global and localized fibroglandular volume (FGV) <lb/>measures from identified convolutional neural network model <lb/>features <lb/></body>

			<body>selected. If there were ≥ two bilateral targets, then one target from each <lb/>breast was selected, sampling the tissues with the most severe diagnoses. <lb/>H&amp;E-stained breast biopsy tissue sections were digitized at ×20 <lb/>magnification using the Aperio (47.7%) or Hamamatsu scanning systems <lb/>(52.3%). <lb/>Assessment of breast density <lb/>Assessment of breast density was conducted at the University of California, <lb/>San Francisco on pre-biopsy raw digital mammograms from full-field <lb/>digital mammography systems. 25,29,32,35,36 Briefly, quantitative global 29 and <lb/>localized 25 fibroglandular tissue volume (cm 3 ) measures were determined <lb/>using craniocaudal mammograms of the ipsilateral breast, taken at the <lb/>time-point prior but nearest to the biopsy date. Percent (%) global <lb/>fibroglandular volume was estimated using Single X-ray Absorptiometry, <lb/>which utilized a breast density phantom attached to the compression <lb/>paddle of the mammography machine. 25,29,32,35,36 For the assessment of % <lb/>localized peri-lesional fibroglandular volume measurements, the biopsy <lb/>location and radius were identified on the pre-biopsy mammogram by the <lb/>study radiologist. 25 Localized % fibroglandular volume measurements at a <lb/>volume~0-2 mm 3 surrounding but excluding the biopsy target location <lb/>were utilized in this analysis. <lb/>Analytical population <lb/>Of the women eligible for this study, 882 (69%) had Single X-ray <lb/>Absorptiometry fibroglandular volume results available for the ipsilateral <lb/>breast within the year before their breast biopsy. Of these, 852 women had <lb/>target and non-target H&amp;E slides from 1036 breast biopsies available for <lb/>assessment. For convolutional neural network model training and <lb/>assessment, as outlined in more detail below, the study population was <lb/>randomly subdivided into a training dataset (n = 588; 69%) and a testing <lb/>dataset (n = 264; 31%). Overall, the 588 women in the training set had 687 <lb/>biopsies which encompassed 1587 H&amp;E stained sections (667 from the <lb/>target and 920 from the non-target blocks). For the testing group of 264 <lb/>women, there were 349 biopsies (454 sections from non-target blocks). An <lb/>overview of the study design is shown in Fig. 1. <lb/>Development of the deep learning convolutional neural network <lb/>model <lb/>Using the digitized H&amp;E whole slide images from 588 women included in <lb/>the training set, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to <lb/>generate maps of tissue composition that classified whole slide images as <lb/>epithelial, stromal and fat tissue. 16,17 For model training, both target and <lb/>non-target slides were included. The trained model was an 11-layer fully <lb/>convolutional VGG-like network, a neural network architecture developed <lb/>by Oxford&apos;s Visual Geometry Group (VGG). 37 The performance of the <lb/>convolutional neural network model for generating whole slide image <lb/>maps of epithelial, stromal and fat tissue has been outlined previously, 16 <lb/>and an example of the classification is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. <lb/>Briefly, the initial classification of the breast tissue (epithelial, stromal and <lb/>fat composition) was completed through training of the convolutional <lb/>neural network model based on manual annotation of these regions in <lb/>100 whole slide images, by trained students; these annotations were <lb/>furthered reviewed by a pathologist. The AUC of the model for the <lb/>classification of the breast tissue was 0.95. 16 Following the generation of <lb/>the whole slide image maps, features were extracted from the output of <lb/>the convolutional neural network. These features were grouped into <lb/>three main categories, describing global tissue quantities, the morphol-<lb/>ogy of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial <lb/>regions. To examine spatial arrangements of epithelial regions, region <lb/>adjacency graphs were used including area-Voronoi diagrams and <lb/>Delaunay triangulation. 18,19 The area-Voronoi diagram was utilized in <lb/>the context of spatial distribution analysis to define areas of influence of <lb/>epithelial regions in the image. Given a set of segmented epithelial <lb/>regions A 1 ,…,A n in a whole slide image, the area-Voronoi of a region V a <lb/>(A i ) is defined as the set of pixels in the image from which the distance to <lb/>A i is less than or equal to any other regions in the image. Overall, 37 <lb/>features were extracted within these three categories; a description of <lb/>the 37 features and their distributions in the training and testing sets are <lb/>shown in Supplementary Table 1. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Patient characteristics were compared between the training and testing <lb/>sets using chi-square or Fisher&apos;s exact tests for categorical variables and <lb/>Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables. Using the 37 features <lb/>extracted from the output of the convolutional neural network, a random <lb/>forest regression model was used to predict global fibroglandular volume <lb/>(%) and a separate random forest model was used to predict localized <lb/>fibroglandular volume (%) (i.e., in the region of the biopsy target). The <lb/>scikit-learn 21 Python method was used for training of the random forest <lb/>models. These models were then applied to the independent testing set to <lb/>predict the fibroglandular volume measures. We chose random forests as <lb/>this approach can account for any non-linear relationships between the <lb/>features and has been shown to work well even when the number of <lb/>features exceeds the number of observations. 38 The output from the <lb/>random forest model includes the Gini index plot as a measure of the <lb/>predictive importance of the features. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the Gini <lb/>index results for features associated with global and localized % <lb/>fibroglandular volume. Relationships between the predicted and radi-<lb/>ologically quantified (actual) fibroglandular volume measures were <lb/>assessed using Spearman rank correlations (r). Several sensitivity analyses <lb/>examined the potential influence of participant characteristics known to be <lb/>associated with fibroglandular volume on observed findings: (a) we <lb/>additionally included body mass index (BMI) in the random forest <lb/>regression model; and (b) we stratified analyses by menopausal status. <lb/>We also assessed the potential influence of histologic features that were <lb/>strongly correlated with each other in the prediction model. For highly <lb/>correlated feature pairs (Spearman correlation: r ≥ 0.85), one feature was <lb/>randomly selected to be excluded from the model. We then retrained the <lb/>random forest models on the remaining 25 features. We also used the 25 <lb/>features to separately predict each fibroglandular volume measure. When <lb/>the number of features in the prediction model was reduced to include <lb/>only one from among highly correlated features, the top selected features <lb/>for fibroglandular volume prediction were similar; therefore, we present <lb/>results from random forest analyses including all 37 features. <lb/>In an exploratory analysis, we examined the potential of the extracted <lb/>histologic features for predicting cancer status (benign vs. invasive <lb/>biopsy diagnosis) among women with high and low fibroglandular <lb/>volume. Firstly, the patient population was stratified by fibroglandular <lb/>volume (high vs. low), using the median cut point of global (34.4%) and <lb/>localized (40%) fibroglandular volume from the training population. For <lb/>this analysis, all in-situ diagnoses were excluded from both model <lb/>training and testing. Thus the cancerous group was restricted to biopsy <lb/>diagnoses of invasive carcinoma and the benign group included <lb/>diagnoses of non-proliferative and proliferative benign breast disease <lb/>(with and without atypia). Using the 37 features previously extracted <lb/>from the convolutional neural network output, a random forest classifier <lb/>was trained to predict cancer status separately among women with high <lb/>and low fibroglandular volume. The classifier performance for cancer <lb/>status prediction was assessed using area under the receiver-operating <lb/>characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis on the probabilities generated <lb/>by the random forest classifier. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were <lb/>generated using a patient-stratified percentile bootstrapping method. 39 <lb/>ROC curves of the cancer detection systems among patients with high <lb/>and low global or localized % fibroglandular volume were compared <lb/>using the bootstrap method in R package &quot;pROC&quot;, which computes, <lb/>stores and compares the AUC of each ROC curve. 40 <lb/></body>
