The research was guided by the question, What <lb/>principles promoted professional collaboration among university mathematics professors participating in a <lb/>lesson study? The research focused on a lesson study involving university professors of mathematics and <lb/>mathematics education over twelve weekly meetings of two hours each. The empirical material included the <lb/>researchers&apos; field notes and the transcripts of the recordings of the lesson study sessions. A qualitative analysis, <lb/>based on content analysis, revealed that collaboration involved: professional sharing and decision-making. The <lb/>research shows that by fostering collaboration the lesson study mobilized different principles of teaching <lb/>professionalism, such as knowledge that is basic to teaching, values and ways of conducting university teaching, <lb/>a social and moral commitment to teaching, and teaching autonomy, contributing to the professional <lb/>development of higher education professors. <lb/>Keywords: professional collaboration, lesson study, higher education, professional development, mathematics <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Because the work of professors in higher education is restricted to specific subjects that are often compartmentalized within <lb/>the programs of undergraduate courses, professors wind up working in isolation. Nevertheless, we believe that teaching at all <lb/>levels of education, especially university teaching, presupposes dialog among professors, the sharing of experiences and <lb/>professional practices, reflection on teaching and its aims, and the need to promote interrelationships between topics from <lb/>different disciplines. University teaching interdepends on the work of other professionals (Lima &amp; Fialho, 2015), and is thus a highly <lb/>collaborative activity. <lb/>In addition, changes in university education require teachers&apos; involvement and reflection about each dimension of their <lb/>practice and compel them to make professional decisions (Brodie, 2021). Teaching in higher education involves spontaneous or <lb/>intentional collaborative practices that range from sharing ideas about curriculums and students to joint planning of teaching <lb/>(Pischetola et al., 2023). These actions involve dialogue, shared decisions, mutual support, diversification of teaching strategies, <lb/>the proposal of changes, and reflection on practice, as well as other aspects (Richit, 2023). According to Bødker and Kyng (2018), <lb/>collaborative professional practices have meaningful and lasting impacts on teachers&apos; professional lives and on the teaching <lb/>processes of professors and can elicit collectively generated shifts in their practices. <lb/>These processes become evident in lesson study, a collaborative and reflective approach to professional development <lb/>(Burroughs &amp; Luebeck, 2010; Murata, 2011; Richit &amp; Tomkelski, 2020). Collaboration permeates the main steps of a lesson study, <lb/>which include: <lb/>(a) delimiting the topic and objectives for a lesson (the research lesson), considering students&apos; learning needs and difficulties; <lb/>(b) planning the research lesson, based on the study of the curriculum guidelines and directives related to teaching the <lb/>curriculum topic addressed-anticipating the steps to be followed-delving deeper into the curricular topic, discussing <lb/>research results related to the teaching of the topic, as well as preparing a task, and anticipating the students&apos; difficulties <lb/>and actions when solving it; <lb/>(c) teaching the research lesson by a teacher participating in the lesson study, while observed by the other members of the <lb/>group, who register the students&apos; actions; and <lb/></body>

			<body>(d) reflecting on the research lesson based on the notes taken and the students&apos; activities and reactions (Richit et al., 2019). <lb/>Cavadas and Branco (2023) emphasize that collaboration among teachers is essential for professional development. They <lb/>analyze two cycles of collaborative teaching research to characterize the dynamics among four professors in higher education <lb/>involved in an experience related to the creation, implementation and evaluation of interdisciplinary learning spaces. The <lb/>collaborative nature of teaching, although sometimes absent in higher education due to the curricular structure of some courses, <lb/>requires that professors try to promote interaction between the subjects they teach and other curricular components, and <lb/>between their professional practice and that of their peers. Participating in a lesson study is one way to engage in this interaction. <lb/>In this article we analyze professional collaboration in a lesson study, which involved eight university mathematics professors <lb/>and a prospective mathematics teacher. This qualitative research can support discussions about teaching at a university level, <lb/>considering the new principles of teaching professionalism in this context, and to discussions about the contributions of lesson <lb/>study to this field. <lb/>PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION AMONG TEACHERS <lb/>Collaboration is understood as a relational system among people, or as an emerging social process characterized by <lb/>unpredictability that involves negotiations and decision-making, and focuses on resources, goals, products, and results (Morris &amp; <lb/>Miller-Stevens, 2016). The fundamental principles of collaboration are dialog among peers, interaction between colleagues, <lb/>shared decision-making, and mutual support (Hargreaves, 1998). Moreover, collaboration among teachers involves <lb/>interdependence and shared responsibility towards a common goal (Romeu et al., 2016). Professional teacher collaboration <lb/>characterizes the predominant ways of being, acting and thinking in learning communities composed of teachers (Day, 2001) in <lb/>which are valued dialogue, shared reflection, negotiation, joint work, cooperation, mutual support and encouragement, <lb/>overcoming hierarchies and professional sharing (Richit et al., 2021a). <lb/>Professional sharing encourages professional learning to the extent that teachers have the opportunity to socialize teaching <lb/>experiences, observe each other&apos;s practices, learn new practices, study and plan teaching with peers, and discuss and reflect <lb/>together (Plauborg, 2009). In this article, we discuss professional sharing and decision-making, which are collaborative principles <lb/>that complement each other in the different steps of the lesson study. <lb/>Conceived in this way, professional collaboration mobilizes collective efforts to improve teaching, promote student learning <lb/>and foster educational change because it creates opportunities for groups of teachers to learn about teaching and reflect on their <lb/>role in an institution and in society (Robutti et al., 2016). Assuming collaboration as a dimension of the professional development <lb/>of teachers, Day (2001) proposes a reflection on the professional partnerships through which teachers and instructors in higher <lb/>education institutions constitute learning communities. According to the author, these partnerships are nothing new, since the <lb/>school and university careers of these professionals enable them to develop &quot;an affinity of moral purpose and complementarity <lb/>of practice&quot; (Day, 2001, p. 236). <lb/>Day (2001) emphasizes that there is a diverse range of partnerships among professors in higher education, which involves <lb/>continuing teacher education actions for the internal and external community of professors, collaborative research projects, <lb/>educational consultancies, production and dissemination of educational knowledge, and institutional cooperation agreements, <lb/>and others. Partnerships such as these, and others not mentioned by the author, establish a context for professional collaboration <lb/>among university professors when conducting their academic and social mission, demonstrating their moral commitment to <lb/>improving teaching and learning in collaboration with their peers, schools and teachers. <lb/>In conclusion, Day (2001) points out that partnerships among university professors, in addition to creating opportunities for <lb/>reflection, enable these professionals to recognize teaching as a moral activity. These actions are realized through the formation <lb/>of &quot;networks, critical friendships, peer training, reflection in and out of the workplace, analysis and planning&quot; (p. 264). This aspect <lb/>is supported by Hargreaves (1995, p. 261), who says that &quot;by reflecting on their own practice, observing and analyzing the practice <lb/>of other teachers or studying case studies, teachers can clarify the dilemmas they face and develop thoughtful ways of dealing <lb/>with them, based on principles, practices 1 &quot; and on skills that are increasingly developed. <lb/>Through a study focused on the perspective of interdisciplinary collaboration, which involved higher education professors of <lb/>science and mathematics, Cavadas and Branco (2023) emphasize that collaboration among professionals from different fields of <lb/>knowledge favors the development of content knowledge (in this specific case mathematics and science) and pedagogical <lb/>knowledge in relation to interdisciplinary learning spaces. Collaboration also encourages reflection on practice and its effects on <lb/>student learning. They add that professional collaboration among professors takes place through dialogue, decision-making, <lb/>implementation of teaching actions and reflection on components for evaluation (Cavadas &amp; Branco, 2023). <lb/>Collaboration is thus a basic dimension of professional culture that is supported by a set of beliefs, values, habits and ways of <lb/>acting within teaching communities, which have had to deal with similar demands and constraints over the years that confer <lb/>&quot;meaning, support and identity to professors and their work&quot; (Hargreaves, 1998, p. 186). <lb/>Thus, the various elements that characterize collaboration-the ways in which professors relate to each other, considering the <lb/>intersubjectivities that permeate these relationships, values, practices, knowledge, and ways of acting-constitute elements of <lb/>teacher professionalism, which is marked by some idiosyncrasies due to the particularities of the context and the subjects who <lb/>interact in it (Richit, 2023). Collaboration is therefore a dimension of teachers&apos; professional development (Richit, 2021), a process, <lb/></body>

			<body>which is influenced by teachers&apos; personal and professional lives, educational policies, working conditions and the contexts in <lb/>which they work (Day, 2001). <lb/>Professional Collaboration Conceived as a Basic Principle of a Lesson Study <lb/>Efforts to modify educational practices, resulting from social evolution and the emergence of new issues and new values, are <lb/>requiring teachers to teach in ways that differ substantially from how they were taught and how they learned to teach (Borko &amp; <lb/>Putnam, 1995). This calls for new models of professional development that can improve classroom teaching practices. <lb/>Professional development is characterized by the systematic efforts made to promote changes in teachers&apos; practices, attitudes, <lb/>and beliefs, and in students&apos; learning (Guskey, 1997). Among the approaches to professional development that have gained <lb/>relevance in this context of change are lesson studies (da Ponte et al., 2016; Richit &amp; Tomkelski, 2022). <lb/>Originating in Japan, lesson study is one of the main approaches to the professional development of teachers in that country. <lb/>The basic principles of lesson study are reflection and collaboration (Stiegler &amp; Hiebert, 2016). According to Lewis (2012), Japanese <lb/>primary school teachers have a strong culture of collaboration, through which they dialog and plan classroom activities together. <lb/>In addition, they jointly engage in social programs, walks, trips, sporting events, and other activities. The author adds that teachers <lb/>in Japan, and Japanese citizens in general, approach/assume feedback and criticism as a stimulus for future improvements and <lb/>believe that such changes come about through collective efforts. In this sense, teachers understand that lesson study makes it <lb/>possible to make incremental changes that lead to greater changes. <lb/>Research has indicated the potential of lesson study to promote teacher learning and development, such as improving <lb/>knowledge of curriculum content and how to teach it (Fujii, 2016; Lewis, 2002), improving classroom practice (da Ponte et al., <lb/>2016), improving teachers&apos; didactic competence (Huang et al., 2011), collaboratively developing research into lessons (Takahashi <lb/>&amp; McDougal, 2016), enabling change through incremental improvements (Lewis, 2012) and creating interdisciplinary spaces for <lb/>professional learning (Cavadas &amp; Branco, 2023). <lb/>In a study on the contributions of lesson study to developing teacher professionalism, Najikhah et al. (2023) point out that by <lb/>participating in this process, teachers have the opportunity to: think carefully about learning, teaching objectives, curriculum <lb/>topics and fields of study; revisit and develop student learning in the best possible way; improve knowledge of the subject to be <lb/>taught; reflect deeply on the long-term objectives to be achieved in relation to students; plan investigative learning paths; carefully <lb/>examine the forms and processes of student learning and action; develop &apos;powerful&apos; pedagogical knowledge; and see the results <lb/>of professional learning through study and colleagues. In addition, lesson study allows teachers to work collaboratively by sharing <lb/>objectives, discussing ideas, and developing teaching resources (Burroughs &amp; Luebeck, 2010), and to overcome the isolation <lb/>characteristic of the profession and achieve collaborative forms of professional learning (Richit &amp; Tomkelski, 2020). <lb/>Examining the implementation of lesson studies in Italy, Mellone et al. (2019) affirm that when teachers import this approach <lb/>into the cultural contexts of their countries, the experience can cause them some estrangement. They add that by participating in <lb/>a lesson study teachers gain the opportunity to reflect on and rethink their own culture, a process called cultural transposition. <lb/>For the authors, this transposition is activated by researchers, educators of teachers, and teachers through the deconstruction of <lb/>established practices by reconsidering issues of educational intentionality at different levels and contexts (Mellone et al., 2019). <lb/>In this sense, Nguyen and Tran (2022) point out that different cultural backgrounds generate different possibilities for <lb/>constructing meaning and perspectives. Thus, when implementing lesson study in different cultures, it is crucial to <lb/>(a) emphasize cultural transposition, <lb/>(b) make explicit the idealized, received and intended curricula, and <lb/>(c) contemplate the power relations between teachers-students, teachers-teachers and teachers-researchers (Nguyen &amp; Tran, <lb/>2022). <lb/>The aspects highlighted by Mellone et al. (2019) and Nguyen and Tran (2022) draw attention to the cultural transposition <lb/>intrinsic to the process of conducting a lesson study in contexts other than Japan, where collaboration is a central characteristic <lb/>of the culture. <lb/>In this context, the literature has reported different forms of collaboration in lesson study (Quaresma &amp; Ponte, 2021) and <lb/>indicates that cultural elements influence the development of this approach (Richit &amp; Ponte, 2017). Studies also indicate that in <lb/>professional cultures marked by isolation, the implementation of lesson study must initially develop collaboration based on dialog <lb/>and trust among peers (Richit et al., 2023). <lb/>Examining professional collaboration in the Brazilian scenario, Richit et al. (2021a) show that professional collaboration in a <lb/>lesson study is promoted through different but connected aspects including, dialog, professional sharing, incentive, and mutual <lb/>support, cooperation and shared reflection. They conclude that through lesson study, teachers can experience a collaborative and <lb/>reflective form of teacher education, overcoming the individualism that is still prevalent in teaching, as it is in the university <lb/>context in some cases. <lb/>Meanwhile, Cerbin (2011) identifies various contributions of lesson studies in higher education by analyzing a series of <lb/>experiences conducted between 2003 and 2010 by a team from the University of Wisconsin, USA, which involved the fields of <lb/>Biology, Economics, English and Psychology. The author points out that lesson studies with university professors not only improve <lb/>student learning, but also promote the growth of professors and positively influence the participants&apos; teaching practices. The <lb/>reflections of the project members indicate that the lesson study influenced them in the following aspects: it develops pedagogical <lb/>thinking, favors changes in teaching practices, provides opportunities to understand student learning and develop knowledge <lb/>about students, promotes a deeper understanding of the curriculum topic covered, and broadens collaboration with colleagues <lb/>(Cerbin, 2011). The author highlights that the most significant and beneficial aspects for the participants were collaboration with <lb/></body>

			<body>peers, the study of different strategies and alternative forms of teaching and the observation and analysis of student learning <lb/>(Cerbin, 2011). <lb/>METHODOLOGY <lb/>Nature &amp; Objective <lb/>This research, which is qualitative in nature (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2006), corroborates that the professional development of <lb/>university professors has an eminently social and dynamic nature, and is a process that is promoted through collaboration among <lb/>peers, and examined in the light of the different meanings and values that this process involves for each participant in a lesson <lb/>study. The objective of this qualitative research was to analyze professional collaboration in a lesson study with university <lb/>mathematics professors to contribute to their professional development. <lb/>Context &amp; Participants <lb/>The research was conducted of a lesson study carried out between April and July 2021, which involved eight professors (Amy, <lb/>Alice, Catarina, Christopher, Esther, Estrela, Michel, and Tatiana-fictitious names), who teach mathematics and/or mathematics <lb/>education at universities and federal institutes in southern Brazil, and an undergraduate student working towards teaching <lb/>certification in mathematics (Natan-fictitious name), who contributed to preparing the materials for the research lesson and <lb/>carrying out the research. The team was established through the initiative of Alice, Amy, and Esther, who determined that each of <lb/>them should invite two higher education mathematics teachers to take part in the lesson study, and that one should have <lb/>experience in calculus. We thus formed a team of teachers with experience in calculus and mathematics education. Table 1 shows <lb/>the field in which the participants work, their higher education institutions, where they are from and the state in which they are <lb/>based. <lb/>All the professors have more than 10 years&apos; experience in university teaching, working mainly in teaching certification courses <lb/>in mathematics. Some professors work in mathematics education and calculus, as shown in Table 1. <lb/>The lesson study was conceived and conducted by the first author of the article, and the activities of each step were planned <lb/>in collaboration with the participants. The lesson study was organized in four stages; definition of objectives for the research <lb/>lesson (three meetings), planning (six meetings), teaching the lesson (one meeting) and post-lesson reflection (two meetings). It <lb/>was realized in twelve remote, weekly meetings of two hours each, and was dedicated to deepening the curriculum topic <lb/>&apos;maximums and minimums&apos;, covered in the subject of calculus. <lb/>Empirical Material &amp; Analysis <lb/>The empirical material consists of the researchers&apos; field notes and the transcripts of the recordings of all lesson study sessions. <lb/>We emphasize that although the research assumes the principles of collaboration established by the literature in the field, the <lb/>analysis was conducted inductively, in such a way that the categories emerged during the process. The analysis established as <lb/>reference units the group of excerpts extracted from the empirical material that revealed the basic principles of professional <lb/>collaboration in the group. We then grouped these reference units, considering their proximity to each other, forming the <lb/>categories of analysis, which were named: professional sharing and decision-making. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Professional Sharing <lb/>This principle of collaboration was favored in the lesson study with higher education professors due to the diversity and <lb/>duration of the participants&apos; professional experiences, their academic trajectories, and the fact that the team worked in calculus <lb/>(and other disciplines) and in mathematics education. Thus, the sharing allowed reflecting on aspects related to university <lb/>teaching from two complementary perspectives. The main sharing among the group involved readings, classroom activities, <lb/>mathematics tasks, academic and professional experiences, academic achievements and events. <lb/>Spontaneously, from the very first meeting, the sharing of readings (articles, books, theses, and dissertations) was <lb/>consolidated in the dynamics of the lesson study, so that some suggestions were incorporated into the planning of activities and <lb/>others served as support material for other teaching and research activities by the participants. In the second session, after <lb/>presenting the structure of the lesson studies, a discussion emerged on the concept of an exploratory approach and the distinction <lb/>between exercise, problem, investigation, and exploratory task. As part of this discussion, Esther recommended reading the text <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>&quot;Investigar, ensinar e aprender&quot;, (investigate, teach and learn), by da Ponte (2003), which was essential for developing the task for <lb/>the research lesson and, above all, for explaining the nature of each type of task, as was seen in the 4 th session of the cycle. <lb/>Catarina: [When sharing on a screen the article mentioned above, she says:] Do you see this chart, [in the form of a] <lb/>Cartesian plane? [...] on the right side are the open tasks, which are explorations and investigations. And on the left are the <lb/>closed tasks, exercises, and problems. What defines each one is the level of challenge, whether it&apos;s low or high. Exploration <lb/>has a lower level of challenge, investigation is higher. The exercise is closed and has a low level of challenge, and the <lb/>problem is closed and has a slightly higher level of challenge. Thus, this would be the main difference between them, right? <lb/>(4 th session). <lb/>In relation to the readings shared, the experience with this group allowed reflecting on the organization of lesson study by <lb/>socializing some of the predominant models in the field. In the context of a discussion on lesson study models developed by <lb/>researchers from various countries, and considering the risks of losing the essence of the approach due to how it has been adapted <lb/>in cultural contexts other than Japan, it was highlighted that: <lb/>Catarina: And there&apos;s this English model that Alice mentioned, which is used in basic education. They [set up] focus groups, <lb/>they choose [themes], they select students-students with more skills, students with more difficulties-[and so they set up] <lb/>a group that represents the class, which is a sample of the class. And then they do a focus group and discuss in more depth <lb/>what was done in the research lesson, to try to find more elements. And in higher education, in the article I read, they have <lb/>also adopted this model, of doing focus groups with higher education students as well. So, if we have the opportunity to <lb/>do this focus group, it would also be interesting. [Otherwise], I think a well-designed questionnaire [...] will give us a lot of <lb/>interesting answers (6 th session). <lb/>Next, Catarina shared the results of the study by Amanda Alvine et al. (2007), which presents an experience of a lesson study <lb/>conducted in calculus at Harvard University. This reading was essential for preparing the observation protocol for the research <lb/>lesson and, above all, for carrying out the post-lesson reflection. <lb/>In the eighth session of the lesson study, after socializing a reading done by Esther, the group continued to work on the task <lb/>for the research lesson. After discussing the structure of the task and its potential to encourage mathematical discoveries from <lb/>the perspective of an exploratory approach, some readings were suggested, as recorded below: <lb/>After discussing the particularities of exploratory tasks and the care we should take when designing an exploratory task <lb/>for higher education, Catarina mentioned an article by Alessandro Jacques Ribeiro and Juliana Paulin Viol, published in <lb/>2020 in the Revista Acta Scientiae, which discusses Exploratory Tasks in university teaching. In addition, Catarina said that <lb/>she had contacted the authors and asked for access to the tasks presented in the text so that we could compare them with <lb/>the one we were developing, which is also related to calculus (field notes, 8 th session). <lb/>Some of the readings were socialized and compared in the context of the discussions held during the planning stage of the <lb/>research lesson. Others were shared via the communication devices used by the group (Classroom, Google Drive, and Whatsapp), <lb/>providing support for the teaching and research activities carried out by the participants, such as the work of Cerbin (2011), which <lb/>became one of the main references for our research on lesson study in higher education. <lb/>Sharing tasks involving calculus also promoted collaboration in the group. At the beginning of the lesson study, when the <lb/>group began to think about the task for the research lesson, the participants who taught Calculus presented some problems as a <lb/>starting point. For example, in the 3 rd session Christopher shared some tasks that he often presents in calculus lessons of which <lb/>he highlighted an introductory problem on the topic of &apos;maximums and minimums&apos; (see Figure 1), based on which he promotes <lb/>the construction of a definition and then carries out the tests of the first and second derivatives. <lb/>After Christopher explained how he often presents the task to his classes, Amy asked him about the discoveries/conclusions <lb/>made by the students from these problems. <lb/>Amy: That&apos;s an interesting problem [...]. What are the main mathematical discoveries and conclusions that students make <lb/>from problems like this? <lb/>Christopher: This is a problem they like, although some of them find it more difficult. At first we use a table so they can see <lb/>the possibilities of lengths that satisfy the fixed value. [With the] table, fixing the length, because it has to be fixed, they <lb/>vary x and y, to see if the length gets bigger or smaller. So there are several possibilities. But you will not be able to solve <lb/>by [table] for the rest of your life. And then they realize that they can solve faster with the tools of calculus, based on <lb/>derivatives for maxima and minima. <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>Amy: I&apos;d like to propose these problems to my students if you allow me, of course. <lb/>At the end, Amy asked Christopher if she could use the tasks he shared with her calculus students, which he readily agreed to. <lb/>Furthermore, the sharing of activities was important in defining the context and structure of the task prepared for the research <lb/>lesson, as the following excerpt shows. <lb/>Michel: There&apos;s a problem [...] in James Stewart&apos;s book, which I think is also interesting to raise. It has a ready-made model, <lb/>so you would not need to create a problem like […] the geometry ones we were doing. However, the problem provides <lb/>some very interesting interpretations of what we were talking about in [4 th session], about what a critical point is. That a <lb/>critical point is a candidate for a maximum or a minimum. It&apos;s not necessarily going to be a global maximum, nor is it <lb/>necessarily going to be a global minimum, sometimes it&apos;s just going to be a maximum in the region of the graph (6 th <lb/>session). <lb/>Esther: I also found interesting the first idea of working with something more open and related to their context (referring <lb/>to the agricultural context of the IFC region). <lb/>Natan: we could begin with a task in this contextual sense and at some point steer it towards this specific objective, related <lb/>to the concept [of maximum and minimum]. <lb/>The activities socialized and analyzed in the lesson study influenced the elaboration of the task and promoted collaboration <lb/>at higher levels. Similarly, sharing of academic achievements was a particular feature of this cycle. For example, in the seventh <lb/>meeting of the cycle, after welcoming all the participants, Michel shared an important academic achievement during the time <lb/>dedicated to general reports and events of the week. <lb/>Michel: Guys, I&apos;d like to share some news with you. It may seem like a small thing, but for me it&apos;s very important and means <lb/>a lot. This week, an article of mine, and some of my colleagues, including Tatiana, was published. I&apos;m very proud, very <lb/>happy with this work [...]. The article is a discussion, based on a literature review, about the meaning of concept from <lb/>Vygotsky&apos;s perspective (7 th session). <lb/>This article was then read by some of the lesson study participants, who made some comments at the next meeting (8 th <lb/>session) in which Alice pointed out that the article provides important reflections on how the central concepts of Vygotsky&apos;s theory <lb/>are assimilated into teaching processes. In addition, sharing of academic experiences was highly valued in the group and became <lb/>part of the process. Before beginning the activities of each planning session, in the space dedicated to brief news and general <lb/>sharing, they spontaneously began reporting on the events they had taken part in that week. <lb/>Catarina: [Referring to the doctoral seminars held that day at the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa] This <lb/>is an internal seminar, where doctoral students talk a bit about how their research is going. And today we had six <lb/>presentations and on Wednesday we&apos;ll have four more if I&apos;m not mistaken. So there are doctoral students from various <lb/>classes, not all from the same lesson [...]. Each one talks a little about their research. Today&apos;s were lesson studies with <lb/>teachers in-service, and I was the last one. And of the [doctoral students] who presented today, I&apos;m the only one who has <lb/>not begun collecting data yet because my lesson studies have not started yet, due to the pandemic [...]. So, it was very <lb/>interesting (4 th session). <lb/>The professional and academic sharings were important for the participants, because they provided support to understanding <lb/>the lesson study and its dynamics, for planning the task of the research lesson, and for deepening conceptual aspects of the field <lb/>of mathematics education and calculus. In addition, the exchanges were a context for professional learning and academic training, <lb/>as Natan highlighted. <lb/>Natan: The exchanges were enriching. During the development of the LS [lesson study], we had moments of [sharing]. And <lb/>not just about the theoretical framework of the LS. All these moments contributed to our education in different ways […]. <lb/>They mentioned events and activities they had taken part in, for example. Some of them took part in LS-related events and <lb/>brought back some of what they had learned, presented, or read (participant&apos;s field notes, July/2021). <lb/>Therefore, the sharing was highly valued by the participants because they created a space that contributed to the discussions <lb/>that were conducted in the lesson study, and that helped to recognize and value experiences and achievements (both individual <lb/>and collective). They also provided input for planning the lesson and preparing the task, for private reading and reflection, and <lb/>fostered new partnerships within the group through co-authored work for events and projects. <lb/>Decision-Making <lb/>Decision-making was a basic principle of the collaboration experienced by the group. In the first stage of the lesson study cycle, <lb/>deciding on the topic to be covered was a process of dialog and valuing everyone&apos;s suggestions and arguments, which led the group <lb/>to define the topic &apos;maximum and minimum&apos;, which provides opportunities for mathematical investigations in different situations <lb/>related to maximization or minimization. <lb/>The group talked about some topics that could be covered in the lesson study. After Amy said she would begin the study <lb/>of derivatives in a few weeks, Christopher and Michel suggested tackling the application of derivatives. This initial proposal <lb/></body>

			<body>was refined over the course of the meeting so that, in the end, the group settled on the topic of &apos;maximum and minimum&apos; <lb/>(researcher field notes, 2 nd session). <lb/>Likewise, deciding on the objective for the research lesson was a negotiated, reflective process that was well founded. The <lb/>objective for the research lesson was defined through discussions about elements of the students&apos; context, their familiarity with <lb/>more open tasks (such as exploratory tasks), the objectives of the calculus component and the research question (problem) <lb/>established for the lesson study (What is the role/importance of calculus and the concepts of maximums and minimums in the <lb/>training of future mathematics teachers?). <lb/>Esther: Amy said that the students are from rural areas, most of their parents are farmers. I [think] it would be interesting <lb/>if we worked on a task related to their reality, because although they may not have mastered calculus, they may have <lb/>mastered some other knowledge that could even help them solve the task (6 th session). <lb/>Catarina: I think that if we were going to use a problem like this, an agricultural problem, I think it would be interesting for <lb/>Amy to talk to the people in the field [...]. There&apos;s also the issue of motivation [...]. Perhaps something related to their reality <lb/>would also motivate them more, and arouse more curiosity, something along those lines (6 th session). <lb/>Christopher: It&apos;s necessary to consider other things that influence the activity, such as the weather, the technical standards <lb/>that regulate this activity [...]. The students need to have this information to think about the problem (6 th session). <lb/>Based on this discussion and with the objective of considering the reality of the students who would take part in the lesson, <lb/>both in terms of the social and cultural context in which they were inserted and the prior knowledge that would be mobilized, the <lb/>group defined the following objectives for the research lesson. <lb/>-Relate the study of maximums and minimums to everyday situations or real contexts. <lb/>-Approach a contextual situation by motivating student involvement in modeling and representing the mathematical <lb/>objects of the problem. <lb/>-Verify and articulate the algebraic and geometric domain of the objects described in the problem and conclude with an <lb/>investigation of the central object of the task (analysis of minimization of the object function-total length of the electrical <lb/>wire). <lb/>-Reinforce the idea that mathematical functions can have minimum or maximum values. <lb/>-Check the use of strategies for solving the questions and algebraic writing of the objects requested, especially for the issue <lb/>of minimization of material (researcher field notes). <lb/>Based on this decision, in the second stage of the lesson study, dedicated to planning, the task prepared by the group adopted <lb/>as its context the rotational grazing of dairy cattle, because the institution, where the research lesson was held, IFC, is located in <lb/>a region with strong agricultural activity and milk production, characterizing the interdisciplinary approach of the topic <lb/>&apos;maximums and minimums&apos;. The task was presented as seen in Figure 2 (Richit et al., 2021b). <lb/>Decision about the duration of the research lesson mobilized reflections in the group that went beyond the specific issue of <lb/>time, in that it considered the objectives for the lesson, the distribution of the hours of the calculus component established by the <lb/>course curriculum and the care taken to avoid disengaging the students from solving the task. <lb/>Estrela: I was thinking about the time [needed to do this]. Usually when we plan something, in practice it takes longer. So, <lb/>thinking about this remote context in which the [lesson is to be held], should we propose something for one evening? Is it <lb/>preferable to work on everything in one evening or [perhaps leave a part as] a hook for the next lesson? Considering that <lb/>the lesson is all night long, from seven to ten, [we have to think about whether this is suitable] for remote teaching (6 th <lb/>session). <lb/>Considering the participants&apos; observations, the group decided to organize the lesson around a task, so that all the moments <lb/>for exploring the task would be completed in one evening (a four-hour lesson). The decision to conduct the research lesson in one <lb/>evening considered the fact that the students were used to this schedule of four calculus classes one after the other, and the <lb/>professor&apos;s need to continue with the other curriculum topics for the discipline in the following classes. In addition, the decision <lb/>was made based on Amy&apos;s concern for the possibility that the students would forget or lose interest in the task if it was conducted <lb/>on two different days. <lb/>After this decision, the group began to discuss dynamics of the research lesson, to deliberate on the different moments for <lb/>exploring the task, the duration of each stage and how to systematize the aspects covered in the text. <lb/>Amy: [In the moment when] I will do this familiarization about the context of the task as a way of presenting the task, rather <lb/>than handing out the sheet, as it says in our plan: doing the reading and everything else. I think it&apos;s important to put the <lb/>main aspects of the task on slides because our students have a more visual perspective. To try to look, to visualize a bit of <lb/>what they&apos;re hearing [as I speak]. So, I [think it&apos;s better] to use some slides, because there are various aspects of veterinary <lb/>science, animal welfare, planting, that I will not remember at the time. So, I&apos;d like to suggest presenting some aspects of <lb/>the task on slides (9 th meeting). <lb/></body>

			<body>In the same way that the introduction of the task required careful negotiation in the group, the moment of collective discussion <lb/>of the resolutions and the evaluation of learning was another important aspect in decision-making process among the participants. <lb/>Amy: [And at] the end, at the stage of [the discussion] of the solutions, I wondered: are we going to have time to [analyze <lb/>the solutions]? For example, if the group comes up with an eight-line solution, am I going to be able to immediately identify <lb/>whether that solution is correct? I was thinking a bit about this aspect, that it might not be so easy to analyze and discuss <lb/>the resolutions. [How can we] do this? Or [do we look] at the solution they&apos;ve come up with? I realized this in the research <lb/>task I did. If I already pointed out that the first group had not solved it correctly, when the second group went to talk, they <lb/>ended up incorporating some of what I said, which went in the direction of what was correct. [In other words, the group] <lb/>altered their presentation, which was no longer what they had discussed, no longer what they had constructed as a <lb/>solution. So I do not know if I should make observations after each group has explained. But perhaps only at the end, <lb/>presenting the solution to each of the questions in the task. Maybe do something more along those lines (9 th meeting). <lb/>According to Amy, the way the collective discussion is carried out influences the socialization of resolutions. Thus, after this <lb/>discussion, the group defined the dynamics of the collective discussion and the duration of each moment of the lesson, observing <lb/>the principles of the exploratory approach, as shown in Table 2. <lb/>Regarding the dynamics of the collective discussion, considering Amy&apos;s comments, the participants decided that each group <lb/>of students would present the resolution of a question from the task, which would be commented on by the other teams. Only at <lb/>the end would the teacher comment. This strategy helped to ensure that everyone took part in the collective discussion and <lb/>prevented the solutions from being replicated by the groups. <lb/>The negotiation around this decision mobilized aspects about the role of the teacher of the lesson, as well as the strategies to <lb/>be adopted to encourage exploration of the task, especially at the moment of collective discussion. This moment of the lesson <lb/>(collective discussion) must be well orchestrated by the teacher to prevent a resolution that is shared first from influencing the <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>presentation other groups of students, leading them to rework their answers based on what their classmates have just presented <lb/>or on the comments from the teacher of the lesson. <lb/>The interaction between teachers who shared experiences in the same field, from two perspectives (that of mathematics <lb/>education and teaching calculus), was an important strategy for consolidating knowledge and establishing principles about <lb/>observation in this lesson study. It also focused the observers&apos; attention to different but complementary aspects of the students&apos; <lb/>actions on the task, revealing interesting strategies and conclusions for the teams&apos; solutions. <lb/>At the end of the lesson study, decision-making was consolidated as a principle of collaboration through the group&apos;s desire to <lb/>continue working in partnership. To this end, future actions were planned (research projects and the production of co-authored <lb/>work) to consolidate the group as a professional learning community, because throughout this process, much more than planning <lb/>a research lesson, a group was formed, with a sense of belonging and which understands collaboration as a key to improvements <lb/>in education. <lb/>Therefore, professional and academic sharing permeated all the stages of the lesson study, favoring more informed decision-<lb/>making. And both-professional sharing and decision-making-inseparably enhanced professional collaboration by providing a <lb/>context for the participants to collaboratively carry out work that is usually conducted in isolation. In this way, the culture of <lb/>collaboration contributes to the professional development of university professors because it provides them with a context for <lb/>growth while challenging them to go further. <lb/>DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSIONS <lb/>The analysis showed that the dynamization of the lesson study with university mathematics professors has collaboration as <lb/>both a starting point and its horizon, highlighting it in light of professional sharing and decision-making inherent to university <lb/>teaching. <lb/>Professional sharings promoted a context of listening and recognition of the participants&apos; experience (Richit &amp; da Ponte, 2019) <lb/>because everyone&apos;s contributions were encouraged and valued, positively influencing the development of the lesson study, <lb/>strengthening the relationships among the participants and consolidating a professional learning community sustained by <lb/>collaboration (Day, 2001). The sharing encompassed the content of the subject of calculus, conceptual aspects, and properties of <lb/>&apos;maximums and minimums&apos;, the resources and strategies for approaching this curricular topic, and influenced the elaboration of <lb/>the task for the research lesson and how to develop it in the classroom. <lb/>Professional sharing involving teaching activities and experiences enabled participants to reflect on their own practice, hear <lb/>and analyze the experiences (practice cases) of their peers, reflect on the challenges of teaching calculus (Hargreaves, 1995) and <lb/>substantiate strategies to address them (Najikhah et al., 2023), which were tried out and analyzed in the research lesson. From <lb/>this perspective, professional sharing supported the participants&apos; professional learning because they had the opportunity to <lb/>socialize and reflect on different teaching experiences, observe a teaching practice planned by the team, and reflect on this <lb/>practice (Plauborg, 2009). In addition, professional sharing created opportunities to reflect on more than teaching calculus, which <lb/>emphasized university teaching as a moral activity (Day, 2001). <lb/>Therefore, the dynamics of the lesson study, especially the atmosphere of welcoming and listening to individual and collective <lb/>voices, fostered and enhanced different types of sharing, which were imbued with other principles of collaboration, such as dialog, <lb/>cooperation, support and encouragement (Hargreaves, 1995), group work, overcoming hierarchies, and shared reflection (Richit <lb/>et al., 2021a). <lb/>Decision-making was a key aspect in the dynamics of the lesson study, which was consolidated from the choice of curriculum <lb/>topic at the start of the process to the administration of the research lesson, considering all the moments of this stage from the <lb/>perspective of the exploratory approach. In addition, recent changes in Brazilian university teaching have brought challenges, <lb/>requiring teachers&apos; involvement and reflection about each dimension of their practice and compelling them to make decisions <lb/>(Brodie, 2021), especially about how to teach in synergy with the course goals and needs of the students. <lb/>Just as professional actions at schools or higher education institutions are interdependent on the work of peers and other <lb/>education professionals (Cavadas &amp; Branco, 2023; Lima &amp; Fialho, 2015; Richit, 2023), the analysis showed that decisions in the <lb/>context of the lesson study were influenced by suggestions and the different roles (as observers, teachers, rapporteurs, critics, <lb/>proponents of actions) assumed by the group members throughout the process. In this respect, we believe that although the <lb/>participants worked in higher education, because they belonged to different institutions and had professional trajectories in areas <lb/>with different emphases (mathematics and mathematics education), their experiences were somewhat different, which <lb/>contributed positively to decision-making in the lesson study. <lb/>From this perspective, professional sharing and decision-making, conceived as principles of professional collaboration, <lb/>enhanced the collaborative nature of teaching in higher education (Cavadas &amp; Branco, 2023; Richit, 2023), insofar as they <lb/>promoted interaction between the perspectives of teaching calculus and mathematics education and made it possible for <lb/>professionals from different geographical and institutional contexts to work together. Collaboration therefore enabled <lb/>participants to develop an affinity of moral purpose and complementarity of practice in university teaching (Day, 2001). <lb/>In this way, the lesson study promoted professional collaboration, to the extent that a context of listening and valuing <lb/>everyone&apos;s voices and experiences was consolidated, the collaboration occurred at ever higher levels. As the lesson study <lb/>progressed, with each meeting held, decision-making was permeated by longer discussions and more comprehensive reflections. <lb/></body>

			<body>This indicates that collaborative decision-making presupposes a welcoming context in which everyone feels a sense of belonging, <lb/>that they are listened to and valued. <lb/>In short, professional sharing and decision-making processes were catalysts that strengthened professional collaboration, <lb/>enabling the participants to reflect on: aspects that interfere with student learning, different strategies for and alternative ways of <lb/>teaching, and on the observation and analysis of student learning (Cerbin, 2011) in calculus. These reflections enabled the group <lb/>to propose a task with the potential to deepen the study of the topic &apos;maximums and minimums&apos; and help students overcome <lb/>their difficulties in this subject. <lb/>The analysis shows that lesson study is based on collaboration and simultaneously enhances it as part of the professional <lb/>culture, because it establishes a learning community that mobilizes different principles of teaching professionalism, such as the <lb/>basic knowledge that supports teaching, values and ways of conducting university teaching, and the autonomy of professors. In <lb/>this sense, the dynamics of lesson study trigger a process of cultural transposition by modifying professional dispositions (Lewis, <lb/>2012) and deconstructing established practices, reconsidering aspects related to the aims and intentions (Mellone et al., 2019) of <lb/>university teaching. <lb/>A possible limitation of this study is that we only conducted and analyzed one lesson study with this group, which may have <lb/>restricted our understanding of the collaboration that took place among the participants. We believe that conducting a second <lb/>lesson study with these teachers could mobilize other collaborative principles and foster new understandings. <lb/>Another limitation concerns the categories covered. The analysis pointed to various principles of collaboration, such as dialog, <lb/>trust, and mutual support; however, we chose to address professional sharing and decision-making, because both permeated each <lb/>stage of the lesson study in a complementary way. However, future research could analyze the complementarity between other <lb/>principles, such as dialogue and overcoming professional hierarchies. <lb/>Finally, considering that collaboration between university teachers in lesson study is approached from a specific theoretical <lb/>and methodological perspective, we believe that new understandings can be developed by adopting other theoretical and <lb/>methodological bases, which suggests the need for further research on this subject. For example, professional collaboration in <lb/>lesson study has been a context for the development of principles that are fundamental to teaching mathematics in schools and <lb/>universities, such as the principle of creativity (Seckel et al., 2019), modelization as a principle of fostering relevant mathematical <lb/>processes (Ledezma et al., 2023), and general principles of mathematics didactics in lesson study according to the onto-semiotic <lb/>approach (Breda et al., 2018; Font et al., 2023). <lb/></body>
