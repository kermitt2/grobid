			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Parametric estimation from a sample of a stationary time series is an important statistic problem both for <lb/>theoretical research and for its practical applications to real data. Whittle&apos;s approximation likelihood estimate <lb/>is particularly attractive for numerous models like ARMA, linear processes, etc. mainly for two reasons: first, <lb/>Whittle&apos;s contrast does not depend on the marginal law of the time series but only on its spectral density, and <lb/>second, its computation time is smaller than other parametric estimation methods such as exact likelihood. <lb/>Numerous papers have been written on this estimation method after Whittle&apos;s seminal paper and in particular <lb/>Hannan (1973), Rosenblatt (1985), and Giraitis and Robinson (2001), established, respectively, the asymptotic <lb/>normality for Gaussian and causal linear, strong mixing and ARCH(∞) processes. The case of long range <lb/>dependent processes, which is not considered here, was studied by Fox and Taqqu (1986), and Giraitis and <lb/>Surgailis (1990) (note also that in a semi-parametric frame, Robinson (1995) and recently Dalla et al. (2006) <lb/>proposed an estimator of the long-memory parameter based on local Whittle estimation). The main goal of <lb/>the present paper is to provide a unified treatment of this asymptotic normality for a very rich class of weakly <lb/>dependent time processes, including those previously mentioned, but also some never studied non causal or <lb/>non linear processes. <lb/>More precisely, let X = (X k ) k∈Z be a zero mean fourth-order stationary time series with real values. De-<lb/>note by (R(s)) s the covariogram of X, and by (κ 4 (i, j, k)) i,j,k the fourth cumulants of X defined by <lb/>R(s) = Cov (X 0 , X s ) = E (X 0 X s ), for s ∈ Z, <lb/>κ 4 (i, j, k) = EX 0 X i X j X k − EX 0 X i EX j X k − EX 0 X j EX i X k − EX 0 X k EX i X j , for (i, j, k) ∈ Z 3 . <lb/></body>

			<body>We will use the following assumption on X <lb/>Assumption M: X is such that <lb/>γ = <lb/>ℓ∈Z <lb/>R(ℓ) 2 &lt; ∞ and κ 4 = <lb/>i,j,k <lb/>|κ 4 (i, j, k)| &lt; ∞. <lb/>(1) <lb/>The periodogram of X is <lb/>I n (λ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π • n <lb/>n <lb/>k=1 <lb/>X k e −ikλ <lb/>2 <lb/>, for λ ∈ [−π, π[. <lb/>Now, let g : R → R a 2π-periodic function such that g ∈ L 2 ([−π, π[) and define <lb/>J n (g) = <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>g(λ)I n (λ) dλ, the integrated periodogram of X <lb/>and J(g) = <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>g(λ)f (λ) dλ, <lb/>with f denoting the spectral density of X (that exists and is in L 2 ([−π, π[) from Assumption M) defined by <lb/>f (λ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π k∈Z <lb/>R(k) e ikλ for λ ∈ [−π, π[. <lb/>Recall that I n (λ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π <lb/>|k|&lt;n <lb/>R n (k)e −ikλ with R n (k) = <lb/>1 <lb/>n <lb/>(n−k)∧n <lb/>j=1∨(1−k) <lb/>X j X j+k , which is a biased estimate of <lb/>R(k). Thus, the periodogram I n (λ) could be a natural estimator of the spectral density; unfortunately it is not <lb/>a consistent estimator. However, once integrated with respect to some L 2 function, its behavior becomes quite <lb/>smoother and can allow an estimation of the spectral density. A special case of the integrated periodogram is <lb/>Whittle&apos;s contrast, defined as a function β → J n (h β ), where h β is included in a class of functions depending <lb/>on the vector of parameters β. Whittle estimator minimizes this contrast. As a consequence, uniform limit <lb/>theorems for the integrated periodogram J n (•) are the appropriate tools for obtaining uniform limit theorems <lb/>for Whittle&apos;s contrast, that imply, under additional conditions concerning the regularity of the spectral density, <lb/>limit theorems for Whittle&apos;s estimators. <lb/>A uniform strong law of large numbers of integrated periodograms on a Sobolev-type space (included in the <lb/>space of 2π-periodic L 2 -functions) is first established only under assumption M. Additional assumptions on the <lb/>dependence properties of the time series have to be specified for establishing central limit theorems. Our choice <lb/>has been to consider time series satisfying weak dependence properties introduced and developed in Doukhan <lb/>and Louhichi (1999). Numerous reasons may explain this choice. First, this frame of dependence includes a <lb/>lot of models like causal or non causal linear, bilinear, strong mixing processes and also dynamical systems. <lb/>Second, they are independent of the marginal distribution of the time series. Finally, they can be easily used in <lb/>various statistical contexts, in particular in the case of the integrated periodogram which is a quadratic form. <lb/>These uniform limit theorems can be compared with those obtained in Dahlhaus (1988) or Mikosch and Nor-<lb/>vaisa (1997). Roughly speaking, the presented results are obtained under weaker conditions on time series, but <lb/>considering different functional spaces. <lb/>Two frames of weak dependence are considered here. The first one exploits a causal property of dependence, <lb/>the θ-weak dependence property (see Dedecker and Doukhan, 2003). Under certain conditions, the uniform <lb/>limit theorems for integrated periodogram and asymptotic normality of Whittle&apos;s estimate are established. <lb/>These general results are new and extend Hannan&apos;s (1973) and Rosenblatt&apos;s (1985) classical results for causal <lb/>linear or strong mixing processes. For example, parametric and causal ARCH(∞) or bilinear processes (a <lb/>very general class of models introduced by Giraitis and Surgailis (2002), see definition (21)) are considered; <lb/>under certain conditions, the asymptotic normality of Whittle&apos;s estimators for those two classes of models is <lb/>established with the same method. (The case of causal ARCH(∞), and therefore of GARCH(p,q), was already <lb/>treated by Giraitis and Robinson, 2001, under less restrictive conditions. However, their proof is ad hoc and <lb/>cannot be used in a more general context). <lb/>The second type of dependence under consideration is η-weak dependence. This property allows to derive <lb/>central limit theorems for non causal processes, see [2] or [19]. These results can be applied for instance, to <lb/>two-sided linear or Volterra processes (see their definition below in Section 3). Let us remark that usual proofs <lb/></body>

			<body>of central limit theorems for the integrated periodogram are established by considering increments of martin-<lb/>gales or asymptotic results for strong mixing processes, which is not a method adapted for non causal processes, <lb/>even in the simple case of two-sided linear models. The proof of our results is a corollary of a general functional <lb/>central limit theorem for η-weakly dependent processes, established by using Bernstein&apos;s blocks method. Even <lb/>if our results may be sub optimal in terms of the conditions linking the moment assumption with the decay <lb/>rate of weak dependence of the time series, they however cover numerous models and open new perspectives <lb/>of treatment for non causal processes. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, uniform limit theorems are presented with some applica-<lb/>tions to time series. Section 3 is devoted to limit theorems satisfied by Whittle&apos;s estimators, that are applied <lb/>to several examples of causal and non causal processes. Section 4 contains the main proofs, and a useful lemma <lb/>is presented in an appendix (Section 5). <lb/>2 Uniform limit theorems <lb/>2.1 Notations and assumptions <lb/>Afterwards we shall use the zero mean random variables <lb/>Y j,k = X j X j+k − R(k), for all (j, k) ∈ Z 2 . <lb/>We intend to work in a Sobolev space H s of locally L 2 and 2π−periodic functions, defined by <lb/>H s = {g ∈ L 2 ([−π, π[) / g Hs &lt; ∞} with g 2 <lb/>Hs = <lb/>ℓ∈Z <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) 2s • |g ℓ | 2 , and s &gt; 1/2, <lb/>where g(λ) = ℓ∈Z g ℓ e iℓλ . This space H s is included in the space C ⋆ of continuous and 2π−periodic functions <lb/>and g ∞ = sup [−π,π[ |g| ≤ <lb/>√ c s • g Hs with <lb/>c s = <lb/>ℓ∈Z <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s . <lb/>(2) <lb/>As usual H ′ <lb/>s denotes the dual of H s with norm defined from the identity T H ′ <lb/>s = sup g Hs ≤1 |T (g)|. Hence if <lb/>T ∈ H ′ <lb/>s <lb/>T 2 <lb/>H ′ <lb/>s = sup <lb/>g Hs ≤1 <lb/>|T (g)| 2 = <lb/>ℓ∈Z <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s • |T (e iℓλ )| 2 . <lb/>We study the asymptotic behavior of J n − J uniformly in the function space H s or equivalently as elements of <lb/>the Hilbert space H ′ <lb/>s . <lb/>2.2 Uniform Strong Law of Large Numbers for the integrated periodogram <lb/>We develop a uniform strong law of large numbers (Uniform SLLN) for the integrated periodogram (J n (g)) g . <lb/>An important feature is that the assumptions are only stated here in terms of cumulant sums. Thus we need <lb/>no additional assumption on the dependence of the sequence X. <lb/>Theorem 1 (ULLN) If X satisfies Assumption M, then <lb/>J n − J H ′ <lb/>s <lb/>a.s. <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>0. <lb/>(3) <lb/>Remark Let X be a 4-th order causal linear process, i.e. X n = <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=0 a k ξ n−k for n ∈ Z, where (ξ k ) k∈Z is a <lb/>sequence of zero mean i.i.d.r.v. such that k k a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞, k |a k | &lt; ∞ and Eξ 4 <lb/>0 &lt; ∞. From Rosenblatt (1985, <lb/>p. 59), and the multilinearity of cumulants (i.e. |κ 4 | ≤ i,j,k |κ 4 (i, j, k)| = |c 4 | <lb/>k |a k | <lb/>4 where c 4 is the 4-th <lb/>order cumulant of (ξ k ) k∈Z ), then X satisfies Assumption M and therefore the previous uniform SLLN yields. <lb/>In Mikosch and Norvaisa (1997), uniform LLN for the integrated periodogram are also proved for causal linear <lb/>processes. The integrated periodogram is then considered on a general class of functions F endowed with a <lb/>pseudometric space of L 2 . In addition of the fourth moment condition, the assumptions are respectively in <lb/>Theorems 3.3 and 3.4, ∞ <lb/>k=0 k a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞ for a uniform weak LLN and ∞ <lb/>j=1 k 3/2 a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞ for a uniform strong <lb/>LLN. As a conclusion, the uniform strong LLN (3) is satisfied by a larger class of causal linear processes but <lb/>the functional space H s is different from F (with also a different distance). <lb/></body>

			<body>2.3 Uniform Central Limit Theorem for the integrated periodogram <lb/>Now, we would like to establish a uniform central limit theorem (UCLT) for the integrated periodogram J n (•) <lb/>on the space of functions H s . Assumption M is not sufficient for such a result. The dependence between the <lb/>terms of the time series X has to be specified, and we will consider 2 cases. Before this, under Assumption M, <lb/>we define for any λ, µ, ν ∈ R, the bispectral density <lb/>f 4 (λ, µ, ν) = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π) 3 <lb/>∞ <lb/>h=−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>ℓ=−∞ <lb/>κ 4 (h, k, ℓ)e i(hλ+kµ+ℓν) <lb/>the matrix Σ = (σ ℓi,ℓj ) 1≤i,j≤m , where ℓ i are distinct integer numbers, with <lb/>σ k,ℓ = <lb/>h∈Z <lb/>R(h)R(h + ℓ − k) + R(h + ℓ)R(h − k) + κ 4 (h, k, h + ℓ) , <lb/>(4) <lb/>and for g 1 and g 2 in H s , the limiting covariance Γ(g 1 , g 2 ) <lb/>Γ(g 1 , g 2 ) = 4π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>g 1 (λ)g 2 (λ)f 2 (λ) dλ + 2π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>g 1 (λ)g 2 (µ)f 4 (λ, −µ, µ) dλ dµ. <lb/>(5) <lb/>2.3.1 UCLT for causal time series <lb/>This first case follows a classical methodology: the UCLT results from the finite dimensional convergence and <lb/>the tightness of the process Z = (Z n (g)) g∈Hs where Z n (g) = <lb/>√ <lb/>n (J n (g) − J(g)) for n ∈ N * and g ∈ H s . Since <lb/>g → Z n (g) is a linear functional, the finite dimensional convergence is a consequence of the multidimensional <lb/>central limit theorem for empirical covariances. <lb/>In the sequel, for ℓ ∈ Z, we will denote by M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 a σ-algebra such that <lb/>M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 ⊃ σ (Y k,ℓ , k ≤ 0) = σ (X k X k+ℓ , k ≤ 0) . <lb/>Here σ(W i , i ∈ I) represents the σ-algebra generated by (W i ) i∈I . An example of such σ-algebra M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 <lb/>is <lb/>M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 = σ (X k0 , X k0+ℓ ) for a given k 0 ∈ Z. The most classical of such σ-algebra is defined, for any integer p <lb/>such that p ≥ ℓ, <lb/>M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 = B p = σ (X j , j ≤ p) . <lb/>(6) <lb/>Lemma 1 Let (ℓ 1 , . . . , ℓ m ) ∈ Z m be arbitrary distinct non-negative integers (m ∈ N * ). Let X satisfy Assump-<lb/>tion M and be such that <lb/>k≥0 <lb/>E Y 0,ℓi E (Y k,ℓi | M <lb/>(ℓi) <lb/>0 ) &lt; ∞ for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. <lb/>(7) <lb/>Then, if Σ = (σ ℓi,ℓj ) 1≤i,j≤m defined in (4) is a nonsingular matrix, with <lb/>D <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>the weak convergence, <lb/>√ <lb/>n ( R n (ℓ i ) − E R n (ℓ i )) <lb/>1≤i≤m <lb/>D <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>N m (0, Σ). <lb/>(8) <lb/>Remark Lemma 1 is a generalization of a result of Rosenblatt (1985, Theorem 3, p. 58) which asserts the <lb/>CLT if for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=0 <lb/>E E (Y k,ℓi | B 0 ) <lb/>2 1/2 <lb/>&lt; ∞, and this implies (7). An analogue CLT in <lb/>Hall and Heyde (1980) (Theorem 5.4, page 136) does not seem to be adapted to work out the forthcoming <lb/>examples. <lb/>Theorem 2 Under assumptions of Lemma 1, the Uniform Central Limit Theorem (UCLT) holds <lb/>Z n = <lb/>√ <lb/>n (J n − J) <lb/>D <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>Z in the space H ′ <lb/>s , <lb/>(9) <lb/>with (Z(g)) g∈Hs the zero mean Gaussian process with covariance Γ(g 1 , g 2 ) defined in (5). <lb/></body>

			<body>Remark Dahlhaus (1988) and Mikosch and Norvaisa (1997) established also UCLT of the integrated pe-<lb/>riodogram for a general class of multivariate processes with high-order spectra (including certain Gaussian <lb/>processes) and for causal linear processes, respectively. The considered functional spaces require to satisfy <lb/>conditions close to the classical Dudley&apos;s conditions. The UCLT theorem 2 needs the simple assumption s &gt; 1 <lb/>2 , <lb/>besides the conditions for finite dimensional convergence. Recall that assumption s &gt; 1 <lb/>2 is also required for <lb/>obtaining uniform equicontinuity, however additional dependence conditions are always needed (see, for exam-<lb/>ple, Dedecker and Louhichi, 2002). The book edited by Dehling et al. (2002) contains also two other articles <lb/>on empirical spectral processes, concerned respectively with uniform results for Gaussian processes (Dahlhaus <lb/>and Polonik, 2002) and long range dependence processes (Soulier, 2002). Tails of the variables and measures of <lb/>entropy need to be controlled as this is usual for empirical processes (see the paper by Dedecker and Louhichi <lb/>in the same monograph); we do not have such assumption to the price of very specific Hilbert type classes. An <lb/>important feature is the fact that assumption s &gt; 1 <lb/>2 is the best possible assumption for empirical CLT in order <lb/>that the corresponding Dudley entropy integral converges. Uniform theorems on Hilbert classes are indeed <lb/>usually weaker results as stated in several works of Suquet (see for instance Oliveira and Suquet, 1998); using <lb/>De Acosta (1970)&apos;s criterion, entails that essentially the same assumptions that those ensuring fidi convergence <lb/>usually implies functional uniform convergence in Hilbert spaces. <lb/>Examples of time series satisfying Theorem 2. This theorem is first applied to 3 classical examples <lb/>of time series, which extend the known multidimensional CLT for integrated periodogram. Then, the UCLT is <lb/>established for a very rich class of causal time series, the θ-weakly dependent processes. <lb/>1. Causal linear processes: let X be a linear and causal time series such that X n = <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=0 a k ξ n−k for <lb/>n ∈ Z, where (ξ k ) k∈Z is a sequence of zero mean independent identically distributed random variables <lb/>such that Eξ 4 <lb/>0 &lt; ∞. Assume also that the real sequence (a k ) satisfied k k a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞ and k |a k | &lt; ∞ <lb/>(these conditions are weaker than those of Mikosch and Norvaisa, 1997, which are k k 3/2+ε a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞ with <lb/>ε &gt; 0, but the considered function spaces in both the UCLT are different). Thus X satisfies assumption <lb/>M and from Rosenblatt (1985, p. 59), we have for all ℓ ∈ N, <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=0 <lb/>E (Y k,ℓ | B ℓ ) 2 &lt; ∞ and thus (7) is also <lb/>satisfied. Then the UCLT (9) holds. <lb/>2. Gaussian processes: let the sequence (X n ) n∈Z be a zero mean stationary Gaussian process such that <lb/>k R(k) 2 &lt; ∞. Then X satisfies Assumption M for all ℓ ∈ Z and k ∈ N, and, with the σ-algebra defined <lb/>by (6) for m = k + ℓ, E Y 0,ℓ E (Y k,ℓ | M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 ) = E (X 0 X ℓ X k X k+ℓ ) − R(ℓ) 2 . But <lb/>E (X 0 X ℓ X k X k+ℓ ) − R(ℓ) 2 = R(k) 2 + R(k + ℓ)R(k − ℓ) <lb/>for a zero mean stationary Gaussian process. Thus, <lb/>k≥0 <lb/>E Y 0,ℓ E (Y k,ℓ | M <lb/>(ℓ) <lb/>0 ) ≤ <lb/>k∈Z <lb/>R(k) 2 + <lb/>k∈Z <lb/>R 2 (k + ℓ) <lb/>1/2 <lb/>• <lb/>k∈Z <lb/>R 2 (k − ℓ) <lb/>1/2 <lb/>, <lb/>from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for ℓ 2 sequences. Therefore the UCLT (9) applies and the assumption <lb/>( k R(k) 2 &lt; ∞) seems to be sharp in this case. <lb/>3. Strong mixing processes: here, we consider the probability space (Ω, T , P). <lb/>Corollary 1 Let X = (X n ) n∈Z be a sequence of random variables on (Ω, T , P) satisfying Assumption M. <lb/>Assume that X is a α ′ -mixing process, i.e. <lb/>α ′ <lb/>n = sup <lb/>ℓ≥0 <lb/>α σ(X n , X n+ℓ ) , B 0 <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>0, <lb/>where α A , B = <lb/>sup <lb/>A∈A, B ∈B <lb/>P(A ∩ B) − P(A)P(B) for A, B ⊂ T . Moreover, with Q |X| denoting the <lb/>quantile function of |X| and α ′−1 (u) = <lb/>k≥0 <lb/>I <lb/>1 u≤α ′ <lb/>k , assume that <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>α ′−1 (u)Q 4 <lb/>|X0| (u) du &lt; ∞. Then the <lb/>UCLT (9) holds. <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>Remark We note that α ′ <lb/>n ≤ α n = α σ(X k , k ≥ n) , B 0 the standard mixing coefficient in Rosenblatt <lb/>(1985). However, no simple counter example seems to be available. Therefore, if X is a strongly α-mixing <lb/>process satisfying Assumption M such that <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>α −1 (u)Q 4 <lb/>|X0| (u) du &lt; ∞, the UCLT (9) also holds. <lb/>4. Causal θ-weakly dependent processes: Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) introduced the class of θ-weakly <lb/>dependent this notion was developed later on in Dedecker and Doukhan (2003). It includes numerous <lb/>kinds of causal times series, for instance the strong mixing processes (see other examples in Section 3). <lb/>First, for h : R u → R an arbitrary function, with u ∈ N * , denote <lb/>Lip h = <lb/>sup <lb/>(y1,...,yu) =(x1,...,xu) <lb/>| h(y 1 , . . . , y u ) − h(x 1 , . . . , x u ) | <lb/>|y 1 − x 1 | + • • • + |y u − x u | <lb/>. <lb/>The time series X = (X n ) n∈Z is said θ−weakly dependent when there exists a sequence (θ r ) r∈N converging <lb/>to 0 such that for all r ∈ N, all function f : R 2 → R satisfying f ∞ ≤ 1, and all random variable Z ∈ B 0 <lb/>such that Z ∞ &lt; 1, <lb/>|Cov (f (X j1 , X j2 ), Z)| ≤ 2 • Lip f • θ r for all j 1 , j 2 ≥ r. <lb/>(10) <lb/>Let us denote X m = (E|X| m ) 1/m . <lb/>Corollary 2 Let X = (X n ) n∈Z a θ−weakly dependent process satisfying Assumption M. We also suppose <lb/>that there exists m &gt; 4 such that X 0 m &lt; ∞ and <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=0 <lb/>θ <lb/>m−4 <lb/>m−1 <lb/>k <lb/>&lt; ∞. Then the UCLT (9) holds. <lb/>2.3.2 UCLT for non-causal weakly dependent time series <lb/>¿From the seminal paper of Doukhan and Louhichi (1999), a second class of weakly dependent processes can <lb/>be considered. This class includes also non causal time series. A process X = (X n ) n∈Z with values in R d is a <lb/>so-called η−weakly dependent process if there exists a sequence (η r ) r∈N converging to 0, satisfying <lb/>Cov g 1 (X i1 , . . . , X iu ), g 2 (X j1 , . . . , X jv ) ≤ u(Lip g 1 ) g 2 ∞ + v(Lip g 2 ) g 1 ∞ η r <lb/>(11) <lb/>for all <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>   <lb/>• (u, v) ∈ N * × N * ; <lb/>• (i 1 , . . . , i u ) ∈ Z u and (j 1 , . . . , j v ) ∈ Z v with i 1 ≤ • • • ≤ i u &lt; i u + r ≤ j 1 ≤ • • • ≤ j v <lb/>• functions g 1 : R ud → R and g 2 : R vd → R satisfying <lb/>g 1 ∞ ≤ ∞, g 2 ∞ ≤ ∞, Lip g 1 &lt; ∞ and Lip g 2 &lt; ∞; <lb/>As a particular case of the functional limit theorem presented in Bardet et al. (2005) a UCLT for integrated <lb/>periodogram can also be established, and more precisely a convergence rate to the Gaussian law <lb/>Theorem 3 Let X = (X n ) n∈Z be η-weakly dependent process and such that assumption M holds. Suppose also <lb/>that <lb/>∃m &gt; 4, such that X 0 m &lt; ∞ and η n = O(n −α ) with α &gt; max 3 ; <lb/>2m − 1 <lb/>m − 4 <lb/>. <lb/>Then the UCLT (9) holds. Moreover, for φ : R → R a C 3 (R) function having bounded derivatives up to order <lb/>3, and for g ∈ H s <lb/>E φ <lb/>√ <lb/>n(J n (g) − J(g)) − φ γ(g) • N <lb/>≤ C • n − t <lb/>t+3 <lb/>α(m−4)−2m+1 <lb/>2(m+1+α•m) <lb/>where C &gt; 0, t = 2α <lb/>m − 2 <lb/>m − 1 <lb/>− 1 ∧ s − <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>, N ∼ N (0, 1) and γ 2 (g) = Γ(g, g) defined in (5). <lb/>Corollary 3 Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 3, for ℓ ∈ Z and φ : R → R a C 3 (R) function having <lb/>bounded derivatives up to order 3, <lb/>E φ <lb/>√ <lb/>n( R n (ℓ) − R(ℓ)) − φ σ ℓ • N <lb/>≤ C • n − α(m−4)−2m+1 <lb/>2(m+1+α•m) , <lb/>with C &gt; 0, N ∼ N (0, 1) and <lb/>σ 2 <lb/>ℓ = 4π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>cos 2 (λℓ))f 2 (λ)dλ + 2π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>cos(λℓ) cos(µℓ)f 4 (λ, −µ, µ)dλdµ. <lb/></body>

			<body>Remark The convergence rates in both the functional limit theorems in Theorem 3 and the Corollary 3 <lb/>are obtained by using Bernstein&apos;s blocks method. Even if the conditions are perhaps not optimal we derive <lb/>convergence rates n −λ in those theorems with λ &lt; 1/2. This λ could be made as close to 1/2 as one wants by <lb/>taking s and α large enough. <lb/>3 Applications to parametric estimation <lb/>Now we will apply the previous results to finite parameters estimates. Let X = (X n ) n∈Z be a time series <lb/>satisfying Assumption M. We denote by f the spectral density of X. Define <lb/>σ 2 = exp <lb/>1 <lb/>2π <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>log f (λ) dλ . <lb/>(12) <lb/>Following Rosenblatt (1985) we shall assume that the one-step prediction error variance satifies 2πσ 2 &gt; 0. <lb/>Assume that f belongs to the family of functions defined in the form <lb/>f (λ) = f (β,σ 2 ) (λ) = σ 2 • g β (λ) for all λ ∈ [−π, π[, <lb/>(13) <lb/>the function f thus depends on a finite number of unknown parameters, a variance term σ 2 and a R p -vector <lb/>β, where β = (β (1) , . . . , β (p) ). The normalization condition (12) implies: <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>log g β (λ) dλ = 0. <lb/>(14) <lb/>Denote also σ * and β * = (β (1) * , . . . , β (p) * ) the true value of σ and β. As a consequence, for all λ ∈ [−π, π[, we <lb/>will now denote σ * 2 g β * (λ) the spectral density of X. We will also consider the following conditions <lb/>• Condition C1: the true values σ * and β * are such that σ * &gt; 0 and β * lies in a region K ⊂ R p where K is <lb/>an open and relatively compact set. <lb/>• Condition C2: if β 1 , β 2 are distinct elements of K, the set {λ ∈ [−π, π[, g β1 (λ) = g β2 (λ)} has positive <lb/>Lebesgue measure. <lb/>• Condition C3: for all β ∈ K, the function λ → g −1 <lb/>β (λ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>g β (λ) <lb/>∈ H s and sup <lb/>β∈K <lb/>g −1 <lb/>β <lb/>Hs &lt; ∞ with s &gt; 1/2. <lb/>• Condition C4: for all λ ∈ [−π, π[, the function β → g −1 <lb/>β (λ) is continuous on K. <lb/>• Condition C5: for all λ ∈ [−π, π[, the function β → g −1 <lb/>β (λ) is twice continuously differentiable on K and <lb/>β → <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>log(g β (λ)) dλ can be differentiated twice under the integral sign. <lb/>• Condition C6: there exists s &gt; 1/2 such that for all β ∈ K and (i, j) ∈ {1, . . . , p}, the functions <lb/>λ → <lb/>∂g −1 <lb/>β <lb/>∂β (i) <lb/>β <lb/>(λ), λ → <lb/>∂ 2 g −1 <lb/>β <lb/>∂β (i) ∂β (j) <lb/>β <lb/>(λ) belong to H s and sup <lb/>β∈K <lb/>∂ 2 g −1 <lb/>β <lb/>∂β (i) ∂β (j) Hs <lb/>&lt; ∞. <lb/>• Condition C7: for all β ∈ K, the function λ → g β (λ) is continuously differentiable on [−π, π[. <lb/>Let (X 1 , . . . , X n ) be a sample from X. As usually, define Whittle&apos;s maximum likelihood estimators of β * and <lb/>σ * 2 as: <lb/>β n = Argmin β∈K J n (g −1 <lb/>β ) = Argmin β∈K <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>I n (λ) <lb/>g β (λ) <lb/>dλ <lb/>and σ 2 <lb/>n = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π <lb/>J n (g −1 <lb/>βn <lb/>) <lb/>( β n is supposed to be uniquely defined). In the following paragraphs, we will show the strong consistency of <lb/>the estimators β n and σ 2 <lb/>n . <lb/></body>

Therefore (see the details of the proof of Theorem 1 in Hannan, 1973), <lb/>β n = Argmin β∈K J n (g −1 <lb/>β ) converges a.s. to β * and σ 2 <lb/>n = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π <lb/>J n (g −1 <lb/>βn <lb/>) converges to σ * 2 = <lb/>1 <lb/>2π <lb/>J(g −1 <lb/>β * ). <lb/>Remarks on the conditions C1-4 The C1 and C2 conditions are usual and can be found for example <lb/>in Rosenblatt (1985) for mixing time series or in Fox and Taqqu (1986) for strongly dependent times series. <lb/>The condition C4 is weaker than the condition of differentiability generally required. It thus necessitates the <lb/>unusual condition C3 related to the uniform limit theorems 1 and 2. <lb/>Theorem 5 Let X satisfy either the assumptions of Theorem 2 or those of Theorem 3.

Let U n (β) = J n (g −1 <lb/>β ). From Conditions 2 and 5, β → U n (β) exists and is twice differentiable on K. <lb/>Denote <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂β <lb/>U n (β) the vector <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂β (i) U n (β) <lb/>1≤i≤p <lb/>and <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β 2 U n (β) the (p × p) matrix <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β (i) ∂β (j) U n (β) <lb/>1≤i,j≤p <lb/>. <lb/>According to the mean value theorem, <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂β <lb/>U n ( β n ) = <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂β <lb/>U n (β * ) + <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β 2 U n (β n )( β n − β * ), <lb/>where β n − β * p ≤ β n − β * p (with . p denoting the euclidian norm in R p ). Since β n minimizes β → U n (β), <lb/>it follows that <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂β <lb/>U n (β * ) = − <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β 2 U n (β n ) ( β n − β * ). <lb/>(16) <lb/>But, from Theorem 4, β n <lb/>a.s. <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>β * and then β n <lb/>a.s. <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>β * . Consequently, from Condition C5, C6 and Theorem 1 <lb/>(Uniform Law of Large Number), <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β 2 U n (β n ) <lb/>a.s. <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>π <lb/>−π <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β (i) ∂β (j) g −1 <lb/>β * (λ) • σ * 2 g β * (λ) dλ <lb/>1≤i,j≤p <lb/>= σ * 2 W * , <lb/>(see Lemma 3 of Fox and Taqqu, 1986).

The Taylor&apos;s formula implies that <lb/>U n (β * ) = U n ( β n ) + (β * − β n ) ′ • <lb/>∂ 2 <lb/>∂β 2 U n (β n ) • (β * − β n ), <lb/>with probability 1, and with β n − β * p &lt; β n − β * p . From previous Theorem 5, it follows <lb/>√ <lb/>n(U n (β * ) − σ * 2 ) = <lb/>√ <lb/>n(U n ( β n ) − σ * 2 ) + O p (n −1/2 ). <lb/>Under condition C7, E U n (β * ) = σ * 2 + O(log n/n) (see for instance Rosenblatt, 1985, p. 78) and thus <lb/>√ <lb/>n U n (β * ) − E U n (β * ) <lb/>D <lb/>−→ <lb/>n→∞ <lb/>N 0, Γ(g −1 <lb/>β * , g −1 <lb/>β * ) with g −1 <lb/>β * ∈ H s .

The end of the proof follows the same arguments as in Rosenblatt (1985). <lb/>3.2 Examples of Whittle&apos;s parametric estimates for different time series <lb/>Causal GARCH and ARCH(∞) processes <lb/>The famous and from now on classical GARCH(q ′ , q) model was introduced by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev <lb/>(1986) and is given by relations <lb/>X k = ρ k • ξ k with ρ 2 <lb/>k = a 0 + <lb/>q <lb/>j=1 <lb/>a j X 2 <lb/>k−j + <lb/>q ′ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>c j ρ 2 <lb/>k−j , <lb/>(18) <lb/>where (q ′ , q) ∈ N 2 , a 0 &gt; 0, a j ≥ 0 and c j ≥ 0 for j ∈ N and (ξ k ) k∈Z are i.i.d. random variables with zero mean <lb/>(for an excellent survey about ARCH modelling, see Giraitis et al., 2005). Under some additional conditions, <lb/>the GARCH model can be written as a particular case of ARCH(∞) model (introduced in Robinson, 1991) <lb/>that satisfies <lb/>X k = ρ k • ξ k with ρ 2 <lb/>k = b 0 + <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>b j X 2 <lb/>k−j , <lb/>(19) <lb/>with a sequence (b j ) j depending on the family (a j ) and (c j ). Different sufficient conditions can be given for <lb/>obtaining a m-order stationary solution to (18) or (19). Notice that for both models (18) or (19), the spectral <lb/></body>

			<body>density is a constant. As a consequence, the idea of Whittle&apos;s estimation in the GARCH case (see Bollerslev, <lb/>1986) is based on the ARMA representation satisfied by (X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z . Indeed, if (X k ) is a solution of (18) or <lb/>(19), then (X 2 <lb/>k ) can be written as a solution of a particular case of equation (21) of bilinear models below (see <lb/>Giraitis et al., 2005). More precisely, <lb/>X 2 <lb/>k = ε k γ • b 0 + γ <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>b j X 2 <lb/>k−j + λ 1 • b 0 + λ 1 <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>b j X 2 <lb/>k−j <lb/>for k ∈ Z, <lb/>with ε k = (ξ 2 <lb/>k − λ 1 )/γ for k ∈ Z, λ 1 = Eξ 2 <lb/>0 and γ 2 = Var (ξ 2 <lb/>0 ). Moreover, the time series (Y k ) k∈Z defined by <lb/>Y k = X 2 <lb/>k − λ 1 • b 0 • 1 − λ 1 <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>b j <lb/>−1 for k ∈ Z, satisfies the forthcoming equation (21) with parameter c 0 = 0 <lb/>(as in Proposition 2 below). Hence, a sufficient condition for the stationarity of (X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z with X 2 <lb/>0 m &lt; ∞ is <lb/>( ε 0 m + 1) • <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>|b j | &lt; 1 ⇐⇒ <lb/>ξ 2 <lb/>0 − λ 1 m <lb/>γ <lb/>+ 1 • <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>|b j | &lt; 1. <lb/>Let (X k ) k∈Z a stationary solution of (19) and taking β = (β (1) , . . . , β (p) ) ∈ R p such that b j = b j (β) for j ∈ N, <lb/>and σ 2 = E(X 2 <lb/>0 − ρ 2 <lb/>0 ) = b 2 <lb/>0 (β) • h(λ 1 , γ, ∞ <lb/>j=1 b j (β)), where h is a positive real function, the spectral density of <lb/>(X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z is <lb/>f (β, σ 2 ) (λ) = <lb/>σ 2 <lb/>2π <lb/>• 1 − <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>b j (β) • e ijλ −2 <lb/>. <lb/>(20) <lb/>Then a Whittle&apos;s estimate can be used for estimating β and σ 2 parameters in ARCH(∞) process: <lb/>Proposition 1 Let X be a stationary ARCH(∞) time series following equation (19), such that there exists <lb/>m &gt; 8 satisfying E(|ξ 0 | m ) &lt; ∞, satisfying the stationarity condition, <lb/>ξ 2 <lb/>0 − λ 1 m/2 <lb/>ξ 2 <lb/>0 − λ 1 2 <lb/>+ 1 ∧ ξ 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>m • <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>|b j (β)| &lt; 1, and one of the two following assumptions <lb/>• Geometric decay: ∀j ∈ N, 0 ≤ b j (β) and ∃µ ∈]0, 1[ such that b j (β) = O(µ −j ); <lb/>• Riemannian decay: ∀j ∈ N, b j (β) ≥ 0, ∃ν &gt; <lb/>2m − 9 <lb/>m − 8 <lb/>such that b j (β) = O(j −ν ). <lb/>Then, under Conditions C1-7, the central limit theorems (15) and (17) holds. <lb/>Corollary 4 If there exists m &gt; 8 such that X is a m-order stationary GARCH(q&apos;, q) time series satisfying <lb/>equation (18), then with β = (a 1 , . . . , a q , c 1 , . . . , c q ′ ), the central limit theorems (15) and (17) are satisfied. <lb/>Proof. First, Doukhan et al (2005) have shown that ARCH(∞) processes satisfy the θ-weak dependence prop-<lb/>erty: in the &quot;Geometric decay&quot; case, θ r = O(e −c <lb/>√ <lb/>r ) with c &gt; 0 and in the &quot;Riemannian decay&quot; case, with <lb/>ν &gt; 2, θ r = O r −ν+1 . Now by applying the following Lemma 6 (see section 5) for h(x) = x 2 and thus a = 2, <lb/>we deduce that (X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z is a θ <lb/>m−2 <lb/>m−1 -weak dependent time series. Hence, by denoting θ ′ = (θ ′ <lb/>k ) k∈Z the weak <lb/>dependent sequence of X 2 it holds: in &quot;Geometric decay&quot; case θ ′ <lb/>r = O(e −c <lb/>√ <lb/>r ) with c &gt; 0 and in the &quot;Rieman-<lb/>nian decay&quot; case, θ ′ <lb/>r = O r − (ν−1)(m−2) <lb/>m−1 <lb/>. Corollary 2 implies that 1/ in the &quot;Geometric decay&quot; case, for all µ, <lb/>(X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z satisfies the Uniform CLT (9), 2/ in the &quot;Riemannian decay&quot; case, (X 2 <lb/>k ) k∈Z satisfies the Uniform CLT <lb/>(9) if <lb/>(ν − 1)(m − 2) <lb/>m − 1 <lb/>• <lb/>m/2 − 4 <lb/>m/2 − 1 <lb/>&gt; 1, i.e. ν &gt; <lb/>2m − 9 <lb/>m − 8 <lb/>. <lb/>Finally, for GARCH(q ′ , q) the spectral density is explicit f (β,σ 2 ) (λ) = <lb/>σ 2 <lb/>2π <lb/>|1 − Σ q <lb/>j=1 c j e ijλ | 2 <lb/>|1 − Σ q <lb/>j=1 a j e ijλ − Σ q <lb/>j=1 c j e ijλ | 2 and <lb/>satisfies conditions C1-7 (more precisely conditions C3, C6 and C7 using H s with s &gt; 1/2 are checked). Then, <lb/>the proof of the corollary is a special case of the &quot;Geometric decay&quot; case. <lb/></body>

			<body>Remark Zaffaroni (2003) studied the question of the Whittle&apos;s estimation of the parameter of a stationary <lb/>solution of (18), this result was improved later on by Giraitis and Robinson (2001). In this paper, the conditions <lb/>to assure the asymptotic normality of the Whittle&apos;s estimate are better than our Theorem (1), in two senses: <lb/>1/ only the m = 8 is required; 2/ the conditions on the sequence (b j (β)) in the general case of ARCH(∞) <lb/>model are only b 0 (β) &gt; 0 and b j (β) ≥ 0 for j ∈ N * and the stationarity condition ξ 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>m • <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 |b j (β)| &lt; 1. <lb/>However, their method for establishing the central limit theorem for the periodogram is essentially ad hoc <lb/>and can not be used for non causal or non linear time series. The recent book of Straumann (2005) also <lb/>provides an up-to-date and complete overview to this question. Chapter 8 of this book exposed the results <lb/>of Mikosch and Straumann (2002) that considered the case of intermediate moment conditions of order &gt; 4 <lb/>and &lt; 8 only for special case of GARCH(1,1) processes. The convergence rates are slower than the present ones. <lb/>Causal Bilinear processes <lb/>Now, assume that X = (X k ) k∈Z is a bilinear process (see the seminal paper of Giraitis and Surgailis, 2002) <lb/>satisfying the equation <lb/>X k = ξ k a 0 + <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>a j X k−j + c 0 + <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 <lb/>c j X k−j for k ∈ Z, <lb/>(21) <lb/>where (ξ k ) k∈Z are i.i.d. random variables with zero mean and such that ξ 0 m &lt; +∞ with m ≥ 1, and a j , c j , <lb/>j ∈ N are real coefficients.

For m ≥ 2, the covariogram of X is R(k) = a 2 <lb/>0 • ξ 0 2 • 1 − ∞ <lb/>j=1 h 2 <lb/>j <lb/>−1 <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=0 g j g j+k <lb/>and satisfies k |R(k)| &lt; ∞. If we assume that there exists β = (β (1) , . . . , β (p) ) such that for all k ∈ Z, <lb/>a k = a k (β) and c k = c k (β), the spectral density of X exists and satisfies <lb/>f (β, σ 2 ) (λ) = <lb/>a 2 <lb/>0 (β) • σ 2 <lb/>2π 1 − <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 h 2 <lb/>j (β) <lb/>∞ <lb/>k=−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=0 <lb/>g j (β) g j+k (β) e −ikλ , <lb/>with σ 2 = ξ 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 . Like in Doukhan et al. (2006), we consider three different cases of the convergence rate to zero <lb/>of the sequences (a k ) and (c k ). Then, using the previous results for θ-weak dependent time series, Whittle&apos;s <lb/>estimate of parameters β and σ 2 satisfies the following proposition <lb/>Proposition 2 Let X be a stationary bilinear time series satisfying equation (21) with c 0 = 0, E(|ξ 0 | m ) &lt; ∞ <lb/>with m &gt; 4 and such that ξ 0 m • <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 |a j | + <lb/>∞ <lb/>j=1 |c j | &lt; 1.

A η-weak dependence condition for non causal linear random fields could be found in Doukhan and <lb/>Lang (2002, p. 3); under the previous assumptions, X is a η-weak dependent time series with the relation: <lb/>η 2 <lb/>2r = O <lb/>|k|&gt;r <lb/>a 2 <lb/>k (β) =⇒ η r = O <lb/>1 <lb/>r a−1/2 . Proposition 3 is then a consequence of Theorem 3. <lb/>Remark 1/ The Condition C7 of central limit theorem (17) is automatically satisfied by the convergence <lb/>rate of (a k ) and therefore is not required in Proposition 3. <lb/>2/The especial case of ARMA process i.e. f (β,σ 2 ) (λ) = | A(e iλ ) <lb/>B(e iλ ) | 2 , with A and B polynomials <lb/>A(z) = <lb/>q <lb/>k=0 <lb/>a k z k , a 0 = 0, B(z) = <lb/>p <lb/>k=0 <lb/>b k z k , b 0 = 1, <lb/>without zeros in the circle and with no common factors, is interesting. We have β = (a 0 , . . . , a q , b 0 , . . . , b p ) <lb/>(Rosenblatt, 1985 page 206) and σ 2 could be computed by using Jessen formula&apos;s. A factorization as in (13) is <lb/>then possible. In this setting conditions C1-7 are readily checked. <lb/>3/ To our knowledge, the known results about asymptotic behavior of Whittle&apos;s parametric estimators for <lb/>non-gaussian linear processes are essentially devoted to one-sided (causal) linear processes (see for instance, <lb/>Hannan, 1973, Hall and Heyde, 1980, Rosenblatt, 1985, Brockwell and Davis, 1988). In such a case, the con-<lb/>ditions on (a k ) are Conditions C1-6, with: <lb/>k k a 2 <lb/>k &lt; ∞ for the UCLT and the existence of k k a k e −ikλ for <lb/>Condition C7. It holds true if m = 4 and a k = O(|k| −a ) with a &gt; 2. <lb/>4/ There exist very few results in the case of two-sided linear processes. In Rosenblatt (2000, p. 52) a <lb/>condition for strong mixing property for two-sided linear processes was given, but some restrictive conditions <lb/>on the process were also required for obtaining a central limit theorem for Whittle&apos;s estimators: the distri-<lb/>bution of random variables ξ k has to be absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure with a <lb/>bounded variation density, m &gt; 4 + 2δ with δ &gt; 0 and the central limit theorem is obtained by using a tapered <lb/>periodogram, under assumption <lb/>∞ <lb/>m=1 α 4, ∞ (m) δ/(2+δ) &lt; ∞.

Such a Volterra process is a natural <lb/>extension of the previous case of non-causal linear process.

Then, for L &gt; 0, <lb/>p L Z n H ′ <lb/>s = <lb/>sup <lb/>g Hs &lt;1, g∈FL <lb/>|Z n (g)|. <lb/>(28) <lb/>Thus, for g = |ℓ|≥L g ℓ e ℓ ∈ F L and g Hs &lt; 1, using again the decomposition (24), we obtain <lb/>|Z n (g)| 2 ≤ 3n • (|T 1 (g)| 2 + |T 2 (g)| 2 + |T 3 (g)| 2 ). <lb/>First, from a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have <lb/>n(|T 1 (g)| 2 + |T 2 (g)| 2 ) ≤ n <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>|ℓ|≥n∨L <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s R(ℓ) 2 <lb/>|ℓ|≥n∨L <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) 2s g 2 <lb/>ℓ <lb/>+ I <lb/>1 {L&lt;n} <lb/>1 <lb/>n 2 <lb/>L≤|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>|ℓ| 2 (1 + |ℓ|) −2s R(ℓ) 2 <lb/>L≤|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) 2s g 2 <lb/>ℓ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>≤ n(1 + |n ∨ L|) −2s <lb/>|ℓ|≥n∨L <lb/>R(ℓ) 2 + I <lb/>1 {L&lt;n} <lb/>L≤|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>|ℓ|(1 + |ℓ|) −2s R(ℓ) 2 <lb/>≤ γ L(1 + L) −2s I <lb/>1 {L≥n} + L(1 + L) −2s I <lb/>1 {L&lt;n} . <lb/>Thus, we obtain <lb/>sup <lb/>g Hs &lt;1, g∈FL <lb/>n |T 1 (g)| 2 + |T 2 (g)| 2 −→ <lb/>L→∞ <lb/>0. <lb/>(29) <lb/>Also note that <lb/>√ <lb/>n T 3 (g) = <lb/>√ <lb/>n <lb/>|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>( R n (ℓ) − E R n (ℓ))g ℓ <lb/>n |T 3 (g)| 2 ≤ n <lb/>L≤|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s ( R n (ℓ) − E R n (ℓ)) 2 <lb/>E <lb/>sup <lb/>g Hs &lt;1, g∈FL <lb/>n|T 3 (g)| 2 <lb/>≤ <lb/>L≤|ℓ|&lt;n <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s • sup <lb/>ℓ <lb/>n Var ( R n (ℓ)) ≤ <lb/>|ℓ|≥L <lb/>(1 + |ℓ|) −2s (κ 4 + 3γ). <lb/>Since ℓ∈Z (1 + |ℓ|) −2s &lt; +∞, we deduce E <lb/>sup <lb/>g Hs &lt;1, g∈FL <lb/>n|T 3 (g)| 2 −→ <lb/>L→∞ <lb/>0. With (29) and (28), the proof <lb/>ends. <lb/>Now the proof of Theorem 2 can be achieved. Indeed, the tightness allows to establish the functional cen-<lb/>tral limit theorem. Moreover, J n (g) − EJ n (g) = <lb/>ℓ∈Z g ℓ ( R n (ℓ) − E ( R n (ℓ)), and therefore, from (4), the <lb/>limiting covariance of the process (Z n ) n≥1 is given by (5).

For <lb/>an example of the use of such a result, see the paragraph devoted to causal ARCH(∞) time series. <lb/>Lemma 6 Let (X i ) i∈Z be a R d -valued and L p -stationary time series with p &gt; 1, h : R d → R be a function <lb/>such that |h(x)| ≤ c x a and |h(x) − h(y)| ≤ c x − y ( x a−1 + y a−1 ) for (x, y) ∈ R d 2 , • a norm on <lb/>R d , with 0 &lt; c and 1 ≤ a &lt; p. Let (Y i ) i∈Z be the stationary times series defined by Y i = h(X i ) for i ∈ Z. Then <lb/>• If (X i ) i∈Z is θ-weakly dependent time series, then (Y i ) i∈Z is a stationary θ Y -weakly dependent time series, <lb/>such that ∀r ∈ N, θ Y <lb/>r = C • θ <lb/>p−a <lb/>p−1 <lb/>r <lb/>with a constant C &gt; 0; <lb/>• If (X i ) i∈Z is η-weakly dependent time series, then (Y i ) i∈Z is a η Y -weakly dependent time series, such that <lb/>∀r ∈ N, η Y <lb/>r = C • η <lb/>p−a <lb/>p−1 <lb/>r <lb/>with a constant C &gt; 0. <lb/>Proof. We first assume that d = 1. Let f : R u → R and g : R v → R two real functions such that Lip f &lt; ∞, <lb/>f ∞ ≤ 1, Lip g &lt; ∞, g ∞ ≤ 1. Denote x (M) = (x∧M )∨(−M ) for x ∈ R. For simplicity we first assume that <lb/>v = 2. Let i 1 , . . . , i u , j 1 , . . . , j v ∈ Z u+v such that i 1 , . . . , i u ≥ r and j 1 , . . . , j v ≤ 0 and denote x i = (X i1 , . . . , X iu ) <lb/>and x j = (X j1 , . . . , X jv ). We then define functions F : R u → R, F (M) : R u → R and G : R v → R, <lb/>G (M) : R v → R through the relations, F (x i ) = f (h(X i1 ), . . . , h(X iu )), F (M) (x i ) = f (h(X <lb/>(M) <lb/>i1 ), . . . , h(X <lb/>(M) <lb/>iu )) <lb/>and G(x j ) = g(h(X j1 ), . . . , h(X jv )), G (M) (x j ) = g(h(X <lb/>(M) <lb/>j1 ), . . . , h(X <lb/>(M) <lb/>jv )). Then <lb/>|Cov (F (x i ), G(x j ))| ≤ |Cov (F (x i ), G(x j ) − G (M) (x j ))| + |Cov (F (x i ), G (M) (x j ))| <lb/>≤ 2E|G(x j ) − G (M) (x j ))| + 2E|F (x i ) − F (M) (x i )| + |Cov (F (M) (x i ), G (M) (x j ))|. <lb/>The last relation comes from f ∞ ≤ 1. But we also have <lb/>E|G(x j ) − G (M) (x j ))| ≤ v • Lip g • E|h(X 0 ) − h(X <lb/>(M) <lb/>0 <lb/>)| <lb/>≤ 2c • v • Lip g • E |X 0 | a • I <lb/>1 |X0|&gt;M <lb/>(from the assumptions on h), <lb/>≤ 2c • v • Lip g • X 0 p • M a−p <lb/>(from Markov inequality). <lb/>The same thing holds for F . Moreover, the functions F (M) and G (M) satisfy Lip F (M) = Lip F (M) = c • M a−1 , <lb/>with c &gt; 0, and F (M) ∞ ≤ 1, G (M) ∞ ≤ 1. Thus, from the definition of the weak dependence of X <lb/>Cov F (M) (x i ), G (M) (x j ) <lb/>≤ CvLip f M a−1 θ r , with u = 2, under condition θ; <lb/>≤ C(vLip f + uLip g)M a−1 η r , under condition η. <lb/></body>
