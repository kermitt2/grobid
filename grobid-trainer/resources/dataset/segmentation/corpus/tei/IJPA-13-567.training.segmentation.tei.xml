			<body>Introduction <lb/>isceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is an in-<lb/>fectious systemic parasitic disease, <lb/>widespread in the Old and New <lb/>World. Leishmania parasites are obligatory in-<lb/>tracellular protozoans of the genus Leishmania, <lb/>which infects humans as well as domestic and <lb/>wild animals, transmitted via the infective <lb/>bites of Phlebotomine sand flies. Several clini-<lb/>cal syndromes with a wide clinical spectrum of <lb/>the severe disease ranges are exhibited in VL, <lb/>particularly in children and immunocompro-<lb/>mised patients (1). <lb/>VL spreads over the world in tropical and <lb/>subtropical regions reported an average annual <lb/>incidence of 500000 cases of the visceral form <lb/>(2). In six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, <lb/>South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil, more than <lb/>90% of global VL cases occur (2, 3). <lb/>VL is caused mainly by L. infantum in our <lb/>country, follows by splenomegaly and hepa-<lb/>tomegaly, distributes in three foci (four prov-<lb/>inces) in northwest and south of Iran. In a few <lb/>cases, viscerotropic leishmaniasis can occur by <lb/>L. tropica, with no specific manifestation (4, 5); <lb/>and also, L. infantum can be a causative agent <lb/>of CL (6). Dogs (Canis familiaris) and some <lb/>wild canids such as wolves, jackals, and foxes <lb/>are the main reservoir hosts for VL (7). Fur-<lb/>thermore, VL has been reported in a sporadic <lb/>form in Iran, but reports from endemic areas <lb/>in northwestern and south of the country are <lb/>100-300 new cases annually (8). <lb/>In endemic areas as well as in Iran, where <lb/>two or more species are the causative agent of <lb/>VL, the accurate identification of the para-<lb/>site(s) and the analysis of genetic diversity are <lb/>necessary. Prognosis of the disease and choos-<lb/>ing and assessing a specific chemotherapeutic <lb/>regimen, effective control of the disease and <lb/>avoiding the disease transmission are the main <lb/>targets of these kind of the studies (9, 10). <lb/>The main molecular diagnostic technique in <lb/>discriminating of Leishmania parasites in any <lb/>kind of infected tissues is PCR-based. Different <lb/>genetic targets and various post-PCR tech-<lb/>niques provide a wide range of investigations <lb/>with various gains, all over the world (11-14). <lb/>In recent years, few studies have been car-<lb/>ried out to reveal the genetic diversity of Ira-<lb/>nian isolates by different methods, various <lb/>geographical regions for sampling and sample <lb/>sizes on the reservoir or final hosts (15-17). <lb/>The main aim of the present study was to as-<lb/>sess the similarities and proximity among spe-<lb/>cies responsible for the disease in the country. <lb/>This can lead to national policies in order to <lb/>narrow the protocols of treatments and pre-<lb/>vention of diseases in the country. <lb/>Therefore, we have used a conventional PCR <lb/>that amplifies the wide region of ITS for identi-<lb/>fication followed by sequencing and RFLP, <lb/>constructed the phylogenetic tree and analyzed <lb/>a number of visceral host-infecting Leishmania <lb/>isolates from different endemic areas of Iran. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Study Area <lb/>The study was conducted over a couple of <lb/>years (2014-2015), carried out in 7 provinces <lb/>of Iran. Seventy cases with clinical manifesta-<lb/>tion of VL were enrolled in the study: 39 pa-<lb/>tients and 31 isolates from infected dogs. Fars, <lb/>Boushehr, Ardabil, Alborz, East-Azerbaijan, <lb/>Qom and Tehran are the provinces involved <lb/>in this study (Fig. 1). <lb/>Human: The isolates obtained from HVL <lb/>were from Ardabil Province, northwest of <lb/>Iran, and the others from Tehran, Fars, Qom <lb/>and Bushehr provinces. <lb/>Dog: Thirty-one domestic dogs selected <lb/>from endemic areas from East-Azerbaijan, <lb/>Ardabil, and Alborz Provinces (Table 1). <lb/>Specimens <lb/>The characteristics and geographical origins <lb/>of the humans (39 isolates) and dogs (31 iso-<lb/>lates) included in this study are listed in Table <lb/>1. The sampling collection in our investigation <lb/>was performed passively. <lb/>V <lb/></body>

At least 3 ml <lb/>blood samples were collected by trained health <lb/>care workers by venipuncture into 10 ml poly-<lb/>propylene tubes and processed 4-10 h after <lb/>collection. Approximately 2 ml of blood was <lb/>used for serum separation. Blood was centri-<lb/>fuged at 800 gr for 5-10 min and the serums <lb/>were stored at -20 °C. <lb/>Dogs: All the suspected CVL dogs which re-<lb/>ferred to health care centers by their owners; <lb/>were examined by a veterinarian. Based on clin-<lb/>ical evaluation (at least one clinical sign of CVL, <lb/>including loss of weight, lymphadenopathy, dry <lb/>exfoliative dermatitis, skin ulcers, periorbital <lb/>alopecia, diffuse alopecia, or onychogryphosis) <lb/>and DAT results, dogs were chosen. Spleen or <lb/>bone marrow aspirations were only carried out <lb/>from dogs after euthanizing or anesthesia with <lb/>acepromazine or Ketamine. <lb/>Sampling was conducted after gaining accu-<lb/>rate information about the place of infection <lb/>origin. Samples and data sheets were referred <lb/>to Parasitology and Entomology laboratory at <lb/>the Faculty of Medical Sciences of Tarbiat <lb/>Modares University. <lb/>Parasitological Examination <lb/>Spleen/bone marrow smears were collected <lb/>from dead dogs suspected of the disease from <lb/>different regions of Iran, then fixed with <lb/>methanol, stained with Giemsa, and examined <lb/>microscopically for the presence of Leishmania <lb/>amastigotes under high magnification (1000X) <lb/></body>

			<body>(18). Blood samples (3-5 ml) were taken from <lb/>cases (humans-dogs). <lb/>Negative and positive control: Five hu-<lb/>man samples exhibiting no Leishmania antibod-<lb/>ies (DAT ˗˗ ) and 5 dog DAT ˗˗ sera from non-<lb/>endemic areas with no history of VL consti-<lb/>tuted negative controls. Positive control and <lb/>human negative controls were prepared by the <lb/>Leishmaniasis laboratory at the School of <lb/>Public Health (SPH), TUMS. Canine negative <lb/>controls were prepared from the Veterinary <lb/>Faculty of Tehran University of Medical Sci-<lb/>ences, TUMS. Negative and positive control <lb/>and clinical samples were applied for PCR in <lb/>the same condition. <lb/>Serological Tests <lb/>All serum samples were examined by direct <lb/>agglutination test (DAT) and rK39 (recombi-<lb/>nant K39 antigen-based immunochromato-<lb/>graphic strip test) dipstick for detection of <lb/>Leishmaniaʼs antibodies. <lb/>DAT: The Iranian strain of L. infantum was <lb/>used for the preparation of DAT antigen in <lb/>the Leishmaniasis Laboratory, at the School of <lb/>Public Health and Institute of Public Health <lb/>Research, Tehran University of Medical Sci-<lb/>ences. The principal phases of the procedure <lb/>for making DAT antigen were mass produc-<lb/>tion of promastigotes of L. infantum <lb/>[MCAN/IR/07/Moheb-gh. (GenBank acces-<lb/>sion no. FJ555210)] (8). Peripheral blood <lb/>samples from all of 70 VL cases (human and <lb/>canine) were collected into tubes with sodium <lb/>citrate anticoagulant 4% (Merck, Germany) <lb/>for PCR testing and into tubes without antico-<lb/>agulant for DAT. All samples used for serolo-<lb/>gy and PCR were stored at −20 °C until use. <lb/>Based on many investigations carried out in <lb/>Iran, the cut-off values were determined anti-<lb/>Leishmania antibodies titers at ≥1:320 with <lb/>clinical signs considered as the disease of vis-<lb/>ceral leishmaniasis for the dogs and ≥1:3200 <lb/>with clinical signs considered as Leishmania <lb/>infection for human (8, 19). <lb/>rK39 RDT: For all the 70 subjects, rK39 <lb/>was performed from plasma samples accord-<lb/>ing to manufacturer&apos;s instruction provided as <lb/>product inserts (Cypress Diagnostic Company, <lb/>Belgium). The dipsticks were briefly placed <lb/>into 50µl of serum. After 1-4 min a red con-<lb/>trol line and, if positive, a second line ap-<lb/>peared on the test field. The test is based on a <lb/>combination of the protein-A colloidal gold <lb/>conjugate and rK39 Leishmania antigen to de-<lb/>tect anti-Leishmania antibody in serum or <lb/>plasma. Negative controls (10 samples) were <lb/>also negative by Dipstick rK39. <lb/>Culture of Reference Strains of Leishmania <lb/>Reference strains of Leishmania infantum was <lb/>MCAN/IR/96/LON49 that stored in liquid <lb/>nitrogen. Culture was carried out in biphasic <lb/>culture media (prepared from nutrient agar <lb/>containing 10% whole rabbit blood overlaid <lb/>with liver infusion tryptose broth containing <lb/>100-200 UI/ml penicillin G and 1 μg/ml <lb/>streptomycin with 10%-20% heat-inactivated <lb/>fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological, Atlanta, <lb/>CA). The inoculated cultures were incubated <lb/>at 21°C for up to six weeks and examined <lb/>weekly for the presence of promastigotes. <lb/>Meanwhile, Schneider Insect (HIMEDIA) and <lb/>RPMI1640 (GIBCO) media were used for <lb/>mass production of promastigotes. <lb/>DNA Isolation <lb/>Blood samples: Prior to DNA extraction <lb/>from the blood samples, 1 mL distilled water <lb/>was added to 300 µL samples followed by vor-<lb/>texing and centrifuging at 4000 gr for 5 min, to <lb/>completely remove interfering hemoglobin mol-<lb/>ecules. This step was repeated three times, and <lb/>finally, the pellets were washed with PBS (14). <lb/>A noteworthy result obtained in previous <lb/>studies to order to completely remove inter-<lb/>fering hemoglobin molecules from the sam-<lb/>ples prior to DNA extraction is; washing with <lb/>distilled water. <lb/>DNA extraction: DNA was extracted with <lb/>the DNG-plus Extraction Kit (Cinnagen, Iran) <lb/>according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/></body>

DNA concentration and <lb/>quality were determined using Nanodrop ND-<lb/>1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technol-<lb/>ogies, Wilmington, DE, USA) at 260 and 280 <lb/>nm. DNA samples with A260/A280 ratios be-<lb/>tween 1.8 and 2 were selected and stored at -<lb/>20 °C for further analysis. <lb/>PCR Amplification by ITS-primers <lb/>For the first amplification primers were de-<lb/>signed based on the ITS region that identified, <lb/>including forwarding primer MOF (5&apos;-<lb/>GCAGCTGGATCATTTTCCGATG-3&apos;) and re-<lb/>verse <lb/>primer <lb/>MOR <lb/>(5&apos;-<lb/>GAATTCAACTTCGCGTTGGCC-3&apos;). The PCR <lb/>product size stays between 800 and 860 bp. <lb/>RFLP Analysis of Amplified ITS-gene. <lb/>Restriction fragment length polymorphism <lb/>(RFLP) analysis was performed on the ITS <lb/>amplicons which obtained from 70 blood <lb/>samples and 3 the reference strains, by using <lb/>the TaqI (1 μL) (Promega, USA) without prior <lb/>purification. After using the restriction en-<lb/>zyme obtained fragments were subjected to <lb/>electrophoresis in 2% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, <lb/>St. Louis, MO) at 80V in 1x TAE buffer, <lb/>stained with safe stain (5 μL/100 mL), and <lb/>visualized and photographed using a UV <lb/>transilluminator. The obtained restricted <lb/>fragments were compared with the molecular <lb/>profiles of the WHO reference strains of L. <lb/>infantum (MCAN/IR/96/LON49). <lb/>Confirming of Identification of Leishma-<lb/>nia Species by kDNA-snPCR <lb/>A semi-nested PCR for detection of Leish-<lb/>mania spp. DNA was performed for amplifica-<lb/>tion of variable area of the minicircle kDNA <lb/>(with a slight modification) (20). The combi-<lb/>nation of primers LINR4 (forward), LIN17 <lb/>(reverse) and LIN19 (reverse) was used in a <lb/>seminested PCR technique. These primers <lb/>were designed within the conserved area of <lb/>the minicircle and contained conserved se-<lb/>quence blocks (CSB), CSB3, CSB2, and CSB1, <lb/>respectively (21). The mixture was incubated <lb/>at 94 ºC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles, each <lb/>consisting of 30 sec at 94 ºC, 30 sec at 52 ºC <lb/>and 1 min at 72 ºC. After the last cycle, the <lb/>extension was continued for a further 5 min. <lb/>For the second amplification first PCR prod-<lb/>uct was added to PCR-mix with 1μM, LIN19 <lb/>primer for 33 cycles under the conditions as <lb/>follows: 94 ºC for the 30 sec, 58 ºC for 30 sec <lb/>and 72 ºC for 1min) and the final extension at <lb/>72 ºC for 10 min. <lb/>Banding patterns of L. infantum, L. tropica <lb/>and L. major were 720, 760 and 560bp, respec-<lb/>tively; visualized on 2% agarose gel stained <lb/>with safe stain. <lb/>Sequencing and phylogenetic Analyses <lb/>The PCR products from visceral Leishmania <lb/>isolates (Table 1) were extracted from the gel <lb/>using a Vivantis Gel Purification kit (Vivantis, <lb/>Malaysia) according to the manufacturer&apos;s pro-<lb/>tocols, were sequenced using the same forward <lb/>and reverse primers used for amplification by an <lb/>ABI 3730 sequencer (Bioneer, Daejeon, South <lb/>Korea). The sequences were edited and manual-<lb/>ly checked with BioEdit Sequence Alignment <lb/>Editor (22), aligned (data not shown) and com-<lb/>pared with sequences from Critidia fasciculate, <lb/>Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum <lb/>/Uzbekistan <lb/>by <lb/>ClustalX <lb/>2.12 <lb/>(23) <lb/>(http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/).

The <lb/>majority of the visceral cases reported from <lb/>the northwest (Ardabil and East-Azerbaijan) <lb/>and some of the southern provinces, including <lb/>Fars and Bushehr in Iran (5) and sporadic cas-<lb/>es have been reported from other regions (26, <lb/>27). <lb/></body>

			<body>In Iran, DAT is routinely performed for di-<lb/>agnosis and seroepidemiological studies of VL, <lb/>because it is simple and highly sensitive (92%-<lb/>100%) (7); thus in our study, we used DAT as <lb/>the standard serological test. Such passive in-<lb/>vestigations are usually encountered with the <lb/>dilemma of losing samples. Asymptomatic <lb/>dogs (7) and probably asymptomatic humans <lb/>(28) are sources of the parasite for phlebotom-<lb/>ine sandfly vectors and as it has been demon-<lb/>strated previously asymptomatic cases reserve <lb/>a high level of parasitemia in dogs and humans. <lb/>On the other hand, dogs support a larger res-<lb/>ervoir of the parasites than humans (14). In <lb/>this way, the cases which did not refer to <lb/>health centers were not enrolled, so we lost a <lb/>significant number of isolates. Furthermore, <lb/>patients who are in remission after treatment, <lb/>despite having antibody titers, but there are no <lb/>parasites in their bodies. <lb/>To detect Leishmania species in Iranian <lb/>leishmaniasis focuses, conventional and mo-<lb/>lecular methods have been employed (29, 30), <lb/>from different geographical areas of Iran, in-<lb/>cluding small sample sizes obtained from lim-<lb/>ited geographical regions (31, 32) as well as in <lb/>the large scale of sampling in a broad geo-<lb/>graphic area (16) by different molecular targets, <lb/>NAGT gene (16) and nuclear ITS-rDNA (32). <lb/>Semi-nested PCR of kDNA, a high sensitive <lb/>technique of PCR has been used formerly for <lb/>detection of Leishmania in the sandflies (20, <lb/>33) and reservoirs (11), is used in the present <lb/>study in order to confirm of species of Leish-<lb/>mania parasite which is in charge of VL in Iran. <lb/>We used ITS-RFLP and ITS-Sequencing <lb/>approaches for the investigation of genetic <lb/>diversity and population structure of three <lb/>strains of Leishmania spp. from different en-<lb/>demic areas for VL in Iran. RFLP of (TaqI <lb/>enzyme) ITS (18S rRNA-ITS1-5.8S rRNA-<lb/>ITS2)-rDNA gene was diagnostic for Leishma-<lb/>nia spp., and comparative for three Leishmania <lb/>species (L. tropica, L. major and L. infantum) <lb/>because of the size of the DNA fragment after <lb/>the enzyme digestion. The electrophoretic pat-<lb/>terns of 70 VL isolates compared with refer-<lb/>ence strains showed that all (70/70) isolates <lb/>belonged to L. infantum. In terms of molecular <lb/>epidemiology, our results are consonant with <lb/>previous epidemiologic studies performed in <lb/>Iran with introducing L. infantum as the main <lb/>causative agent of VL (34). <lb/>Based on our phylogenetic tree, low diver-<lb/>gence and high likelihood were seen among L. <lb/>infantum isolates of human and dogs from Iran <lb/>with a very slight divergence was seen between <lb/>isolates from northwest and south of Iran, <lb/>thus grouped in a unique clad. No correlation <lb/>was observed between intraspecies divergence <lb/>and geographic distribution of the isolates, as <lb/>all L. infantum isolates from different areas of <lb/>Iran causing VL with an isolate from Uzbeki-<lb/>stan. Despite the large variations in weather <lb/>conditions, geographical regions, vectors or <lb/>hosts and even in reservoirs, the similarity be-<lb/>tween isolates was 97.03%-100%, so there are <lb/>no noticeable differences in Iranian isolates. <lb/>This is in agreement with Waki (35), which <lb/>reported L. infantum as the less divergent <lb/>complexes and in consonant with Hajjaran <lb/>(16), employed ITS1 gene as DNA marker <lb/>and RAPD-PCR techniques, revealed no cor-<lb/>relation between isolates and geographical are-<lb/>as (36). <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Low divergence was seen among L. infantum <lb/>isolates from Iran and no correlation was ob-<lb/>served between intraspecies divergence and <lb/>geographic distribution of the isolates. <lb/></body>
