			<body>Melting of 3D crystals has been a substantial field of <lb/>interest in condensed matter physics for over a century <lb/>[1]. In 1910, Lindemann assumed that melting occurs <lb/>when the thermal vibrations of atoms make them collide <lb/>with each other [2]. Then, it was suggested that the crit-<lb/>ical rms value of the atomic displacement at the melting <lb/>transition is rather given by a constant fraction (≃ 10 %) <lb/>of the interatomic distance [3]. This assumption, now <lb/>known as the Lindemann criterion, has been succesfully <lb/>used to predict melting temperatures of a wide range of <lb/>3D crystals [4]. On the other hand, melting of a 2D solid <lb/>is a less understood phenomenon since 2D lattices do not <lb/>display true long-range translational order at finite tem-<lb/>peratures [5]. Consequently, the Lindemann criterion was <lb/>then long thought inapplicable in 2D [6]. A 2D melting <lb/>theory driven by topological defects has then been de-<lb/>veloped by Kosterlitz, Thouless, Halperin, Nelson, and <lb/>Young (KTHNY) [7]. Numerical studies have then shown <lb/>the validity of the Lindemann criterion in 2D [6], and con-<lb/>sistency with the KTHNY scenario [8]. Although most <lb/>experimental observations are consistent with this the-<lb/>ory, it is quite difficult to establish unambiguously the <lb/>existence of second-order solid-to-hexatic-to-liquid tran-<lb/>sitions [9]. Consequently, the melting transition in 2D <lb/>systems remains an active research field in solid-state <lb/>physics [10], and in numerous domains including thin <lb/>colloidal suspensions [11, 12], liquid films [13], vibrated <lb/>granular monolayers [14, 15], magnetic solid films [16], <lb/>and vortex lattices in superconductors [17]. <lb/>A ferrofluid is a stable suspension of nanometric mag-<lb/>netic particles diluted in a carrier liquid which displays <lb/>striking phenomena such as flows driven by a mag-<lb/>netic field gradient, magnetic levitation, labyrinthine and <lb/>Rosensweig instabilities [18]. This latter occurs when a <lb/>normal static magnetic field applied to a pool of ferrofluid <lb/>exceeds a critical value: the flat free surface becomes <lb/>unstable and a stationary hexagonal pattern of surface <lb/>spikes grows. Following the pioneer work of Bragg et al. <lb/>for the assemblage of soap bubbles [19], one can consider <lb/>the Rosensweig spike lattice as a macroscopic analogous <lb/>of a 2D crystalline structure and expect solid-like be-<lb/>haviors despite the complexity of the ferrohydrodynamic <lb/>interaction between spikes and the dissipative nature of <lb/>the lattice. An interesting feature of this system is that <lb/>both the lattice wavelength and topology can be tuned <lb/>by a single external control parameter (see below). <lb/>In this Letter, we report the first observation of a tran-<lb/>sition (melting) between an ordered phase (solid) and a <lb/>disordered phase (liquid) of a lattice of spikes on the sur-<lb/>face of a ferrofluid submitted to sinusoidal vibrations. <lb/>We study which parameter controls the transition and <lb/>whether a Lindemann criterion can be applied. We char-<lb/>acterize structural changes across this transition using <lb/>classical condensed matter physics concepts. Our system <lb/>being dissipative with nonequilibrium steady states, the <lb/>comparison of 2D melting in out-of-equilibrium systems <lb/>and in equilibrium ones is of primary interest [14, 15]. <lb/>The experimental setup has been described previously <lb/>[20]. It consists of a container filled with a ferrofluid up <lb/>to a depth h = 2 cm. In order to discriminate any finite <lb/>size or boundary condition effects, containers of differ-<lb/>ent shapes and sizes are used: cylindrical containers i) <lb/>20 cm or ii) 12 cm in inner diameter, and iii) a rectan-<lb/>gular container 13 × 9 cm 2 sides. All containers are 4 <lb/>cm depth. The ferrofluid used is a aqueous suspension <lb/>of maghemite particles [20]. Its properties are: density, <lb/>ρ = 1324 kg/m 3 , surface tension, γ = 59 × 10 −3 N/m, <lb/>initial magnetic susceptibility, χ i = 0.69, magnetic satu-<lb/>ration M sat = 16.9 × 10 3 A/m, the viscosity being close <lb/>to the water one. The container is placed in a vertical <lb/>magnetic induction B generated by two horizontal coax-<lb/>ial coils (up to 780G) [20]. A pattern of spikes on the <lb/>surface of the ferrofluid is observed when B is above a <lb/>critical value B c = 294 ± 2 G. This is close to the the-<lb/>oretical value of 292.3 G computed as the threshold of <lb/>the Rosensweig instability of our ferrofluid [20]. We de-<lb/>note the dimensionless magnetic induction B * = B/B c . <lb/>Values B * &gt; 1 will be used in the following. A hexagon-<lb/></body>

			<body>square transition occurs at a second threshold [21, 22], <lb/>and is observed here at B * = 1.45. For a fixed B * , the <lb/>lattice of spikes of ferrofluid is vibrated by means of the <lb/>horizontal motion of a rectangular Teflon plate (plung-<lb/>ing perpendicularly to the fluid at rest) that is driven <lb/>sinusoidally by an electromagnetic vibration exciter at <lb/>frequency f and maximal displacement amplitude a in <lb/>the ranges 5 ≤ f ≤ 50 Hz and 0.5 ≤ a ≤ 7 mm, re-<lb/>spectively. The vibrating plate acceleration is measured <lb/>with an accelerometer. A high resolution camera located <lb/>above the ferrofluid container allows us to measure the <lb/>spike positions by calculating centers of the bright spots <lb/>produced by reflections of light on the top of each spike <lb/>(see Fig. 1 for a typical snapshot). A particle tracking <lb/>method is used to measure the spike displacement d with <lb/>respect to the vibrating plate displacement a. For the <lb/>three containers used, d is found to be a linear function <lb/>of a with a frequency-independent coefficient α = d/a: i) <lb/>α = 0.77 ± 0.04; ii) α = 0.85 ± 0.05; iii) α = 0.65 ± 0.05. <lb/>The slight variations of α with the container may be due <lb/>to different relative positions of the vibrating plate to the <lb/>front row of spikes. Since the vibrations are sinusoidal, <lb/>the acceleration amplitude of the vibrating plate then <lb/>reads Γ = 4πf 2 a = 4πf 2 d/α. <lb/>Figure 1 shows photos of the spike lattice on the fer-<lb/>rofluid surface for two different vibrating plate accelera-<lb/>tions Γ, at a fixed B * . At small Γ (Fig. 1a), the lattice <lb/>vibrates at the same frequency f than the vibrating plate <lb/>one: each spike displacement fluctuates about its equilib-<lb/>rium position as would do atoms of a crystal due to ther-<lb/>mal motion. When Γ is enough increased (at a constant <lb/>f ), the ordered lattice melts: ferrofluid spikes do not have <lb/>a steady position anymore and rows of spikes slide past <lb/>each other. At still higher Γ (Fig. 1b), the spikes display <lb/>highly disordered dynamics and two (or more) colliding <lb/>spikes can fuse into one larger unstable spike. <lb/>The onset of melting is defined once a spike has a mo-<lb/>tion larger than the lattice wavelength. It appears to be a <lb/>sharp transition: the corresponding critical acceleration <lb/>at the melting Γ m can be measured with an experimental <lb/>error of less than 5%. No hysteretic behavior is observed. <lb/>Figure 2 then shows the evolution of the critical acceler-<lb/>ation Γ m as a function of the vibration frequency f for <lb/>5 different applied magnetic inductions. For 8 ≤ f ≤ 20 <lb/>Hz, Γ m is found to follow a power law with a scaling <lb/>exponent 2 ± 0.1. This result means that along the melt-<lb/>ing transition, the quantity Γ m /f 2 is a constant. Since <lb/>the forcing is sinusoidal, this means that the amplitude <lb/>of the spike displacement at melting, d m , is the relevant <lb/>parameter for the transition: <lb/>d m = <lb/>αΓ m <lb/>4πf 2 . <lb/>(1) <lb/>For each B * , the value of d m is extracted, using Eq. (1), <lb/>from the ordinate intercept of the slope of each log-log <lb/>plot in Fig. 2. The inset of Fig. 2 then shows the depen-<lb/>FIG. 1: Top views of the spike lattice on the surface of a <lb/>ferrofluid for two different sinusoidal forcing amplitude: (a) <lb/>hexagonal solid-like phase (Γ = 3 m.s −2 ), δ ≃ 15.8 mm, (b) <lb/>liquid-like phase (Γ = 20 m.s −2 ). The vibrating plate is shown <lb/>in white, on the left-hand side. f = 8 Hz, B * = 1.2. <lb/>dence of the critical displacement d m (rms value) with the <lb/>dimensionless magnetic induction B * for different con-<lb/>tainers. d m is found to increase with B * from 1.6 mm <lb/>to 2.6 mm. Note that these values are one order of mag-<lb/>nitude lower than the typical wavelength between spikes <lb/>λ c = 2π γ/(ρg) ≃ 13.4 mm at the Rosensweig instabil-<lb/>ity threshold [18]. <lb/>In order to establish a criterion for the melting transi-<lb/>tion, both the lattice wavelength, λ, and the spike height, <lb/>h, are measured to be compared to the spike displacement <lb/>at melting, d m . The amplitude h of the ferrofluid spike <lb/>is measured by means of a capacitive wire gauge [20]. <lb/>Right inset of Fig. 3 shows h as a function of B * : data <lb/>can be well fitted by <lb/>√ <lb/>B * − 1 (see dashed line) in good <lb/>agreement with theory [21] and a previous observation <lb/>[23]. The melting displacement, d m (B * ) (inset of Fig. <lb/>2), clearly does not follow the same law than the spike <lb/>amplitude one, h(B * ) (right inset of Fig. 3), both quali-<lb/>tatively and quantitatively. This means that the melting <lb/>mechanism is not induced by surface waves higher than <lb/>spike height. For a fixed B * , the wavelength λ is deter-<lb/>mined by measuring the average spike-to-spike distance <lb/>δ on experimental frames (see Fig. 1). From simple ge-<lb/></body>

Dashed lines have slopes 2 (con-<lb/>stant displacement). Inset: Critical displacement dm as a <lb/>function of B * for 3 different containers: (•) i, (×) ii, and ( ) <lb/>iii. <lb/>ometrical considerations, one has λ = ( <lb/>√ <lb/>3/2)δ for the <lb/>hexagonal pattern (1 &lt; B * &lt; 1.45), and λ = δ for the <lb/>square pattern (B * &gt; 1.45). Left inset of Fig. 3 then <lb/>shows λ as a function of B * . λ is found to increase with <lb/>B * as previously reported [22]. Let us now define an <lb/>analog of the Lindemann ratio in solid-state physics, <lb/>γ m ≡ <lb/>d m (B * ) <lb/>λ(B * ) <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>that is the ratio between the rms value of the spike dis-<lb/>placement, d m , at the melting transition and the lattice <lb/>wavelength λ at a fixed B * . As shown in Fig. 3, γ m <lb/>is found to be independent of B * , even at the hexagon-<lb/>square transition. This is the first experimental obser-<lb/>vation of the Lindemann criterion for the 2D melting <lb/>transition of a crystal of ferrofluid spikes. The melting <lb/>Lindemann ratio γ m is found to be equal to 0.14 ± 0.02 <lb/>which is in the range of 3D crystalline solid values (0.1 <lb/>-0.2) [3] and close to the reported value in 2D granular <lb/>fluids (0.15) [15]. Note that defining the Lindemann ra-<lb/>tio with respect to the lattice wavelength, λ, instead of <lb/>the spike-to-spike distance, δ, leads to a single value for <lb/>both lattice topologies (hexagonal and square). <lb/>To characterize structural changes along the melting <lb/>transition at a fixed B * , one computes standard po-<lb/>sitional and orientational correlation functions, respec-<lb/>tively, g(r) ≡ n(r ′ )n(r + r ′ ) / n(r ′ ) 2 , where n is the <lb/>spike density at a distance r from a reference (brack-<lb/>ets are an average over the spatial variable r ′ ), and <lb/>g 6 (r) ≡ Ψ * <lb/>6 (r ′ )Ψ 6 (r + r ′ ) /g(r) where the star denotes <lb/>the complex conjugate and Ψ 6 (r j ) ≡ exp(i6θ jk ) k with <lb/>θ jk the orientation angle of the bond between the centers <lb/>of the spike j and of the neighbouring spike k [9].

Figure 4 shows experimental curves of the ra-<lb/>dial distribution functions g(r) for different values of the <lb/>dimensionless forcing parameter ε = (γ − γ m )/γ m where <lb/>γ ≡ d/λ. For ε &lt; 0 (before the melting), g(r/δ) displays <lb/>characteristic features of a hexagonal structure: the first <lb/>spikes positions are in very good agreement with values <lb/>predicted from simple geometrical calculations r/δ = 1, <lb/>√ <lb/>3, 2, <lb/>√ <lb/>7, 3 and <lb/>√ <lb/>12 (see dashed lines in Fig. 4a). For <lb/>ε = 0, the positional order is clearly short-ranged al-<lb/>though some of the characteristic spikes of the hexagonal <lb/>lattice remain visible: r/δ = 1, <lb/>√ <lb/>3, <lb/>√ <lb/>7 and <lb/>√ <lb/>12 (see <lb/>dashed lines in Fig. 4b). As ε is further increased, the <lb/>positional-order range becomes shorter, and for ε = 1, <lb/>only the characteristic spikes of an isotropic liquid phase <lb/>are observed: r/δ = 1, 2 and 3 (see dashed lines in Fig. <lb/>4c). These typical structural changes show strong sim-<lb/>ilarities with the ones reported during numerical simu-<lb/>lation of hard-disk fluid when the 2D solid-liquid phase <lb/>transition is approached [10]. Our results are also con-<lb/>sistent with the KTHNY theory in solid physics which <lb/>predicts the existence of a hexatic phase between the <lb/>crystalline and the liquid phases, characterized by a long-<lb/>range orientational order (algebraic decay) and a short-<lb/>range positional order (exponential decay) [7]. Indeed, <lb/>right-hand side insets of Fig. 4 show the orientational <lb/>correlation function, g 6 (r). Just above the melting tran-<lb/>sition (ε <lb/>0), the long-range orientational order (well <lb/>fitted by an algebraic decay) is preserved as required for <lb/>a hexatic phase (see Fig. 4b). Note that to utterly dis-<lb/>criminate it from an exponential decay, a larger number <lb/>of lattice periods should be necessary [14].

As ε is further increased, the <lb/>decay rate increases strongly, and for ε = 1, the orienta-<lb/>tional order is short-ranged (well fitted by an exponential <lb/>decay) as expected for a liquid phase. <lb/>Such an intermediate hexatic phase between the crys-<lb/>tal and liquid ones has been also reported in 2D melting <lb/>of colloidal crystals with absolutely calibrated interaction <lb/>in good agreement with the KTHNY theory [11]. Note <lb/>that the 2D melting of these systems can depend on the <lb/>interaction with their carrier substrate [12]. Our results <lb/>put forward that both the Lindemann criterion and the <lb/>KTHNY scenario are applicable to a more complex 2D <lb/>system such as a crystal of ferrofluid spikes with com-<lb/>plex ferrohydrodynamic interaction. Such a continuous <lb/>solid-liquid transition, via a hexatic phase, also strongly <lb/>differs of the first-order transition in 3D systems. Finally, <lb/>our work emphasizes the analogy between 2D melting of <lb/>equilibrium systems and out-of-equilibrium steady state <lb/>ones. Such a correspondence has been observed in a 2D <lb/>granular fluid [14, 15], where spatial homogeneity of the <lb/>energy injection within the system is underlined to be <lb/>the main ingredient for these similarities with equilibrium <lb/>dynamics [15]. Our results suggest that equilibrium-like <lb/>properties can be observed even though energy injection <lb/>is inhomogeneous. This should deserve more studies to <lb/>have a complete description of the 2D melting transition <lb/>of a dissipative crystal. <lb/></body>
