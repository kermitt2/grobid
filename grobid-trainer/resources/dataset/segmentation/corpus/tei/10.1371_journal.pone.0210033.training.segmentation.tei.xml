			<body>Introduction <lb/>LSCC is one of the most common tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract LSCC, which <lb/>accounts for about 1% to 5% of tumors[1, 2]. Smoking, harmful dust, poor oral hygiene, vita-<lb/>min D metabolism disorder, endocrine disorder, and radiation or virus may lead to LSCC[3-<lb/>6], which is most common in men or women aged 50-70 years[7, 8]. The incidence of LSCC <lb/>in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas, and the incidence of LSCC in heavily pol-<lb/>luted heavy industrial cities was higher than that in lightly polluted light industrial cities. <lb/>The mechanism of postoperative recurrence is complex and many factors act together. <lb/>Inflammation plays a decisive role in the occurrence and development of many tumors[9, 10]. <lb/>In recent years, it has been considered as an important factor affecting the recurrence and <lb/>overall survival of LSCC in patients with laryngeal cancer, such as platelets, neutrophils[11]. <lb/>Early treatment is often missed because people pay less attention to early symptoms such as <lb/>hoarseness and many patients were diagnosed as T3-T4 LSCC at the time of the visit. Consid-<lb/>ering the extremely poor prognosis of T3-T4 LSCC, it is necessary to find a simple and effec-<lb/>tive prognostic index to judge the prognosis[12]. However, limited data on the prognostic <lb/>effects of these indicators in LSCC patients may not be sufficient to accurately estimate the <lb/>prognosis. In addition, the systemic inflammatory responses could be changed through sur-<lb/>gery. In this study, we aim at that whether the change in PLR could serve as an indicator of <lb/>mortality in patients with T3-T4 LSCC. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Study group <lb/>This study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital. All patients signed <lb/>informed consent. All steps were conducted in accordance with the relevant principles. <lb/>Patients identified with T3-T4 LSCC underwent tumor resection at West China Hospital <lb/>(Chengdu, China) between 2007 and 2016 were enrolled in the retrospective study. We had <lb/>access to information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection. <lb/>LSCC was confirmed by postoperative pathology. Exclusion criteria are as follows: any other <lb/>disease influencing blood cell lines including anemia, leukocyte disease, hemorrhagic disease <lb/>and hematopoietic malignancy; patients who had been treated, including surgery, radiation <lb/>and chemotherapy, both in other hospitals and in our hospital, regardless of the length of time <lb/>interval of this surgery; patients who had history of the use of anticoagulant drugs; patients <lb/>who discontinued treatment or were treated outside our hospital; lack of pretreatment exami-<lb/>nation of routine complete blood counts and blood biochemistry; patients with symptoms and <lb/>signs of hepatic function damage that may influence PLR. We screen patients strictly accord-<lb/>ing to inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce bias. <lb/>Follow-up and definitions <lb/>All patients underwent blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation, laryngoscopy, abdomi-<lb/>nal ultrasound, cervical computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and chest <lb/></body>

			<body>radiography before surgery. Blood tests were performed on day of admission and the day <lb/>before surgery. The first follow-up was conducted in the first month after surgery, followed by <lb/>every three months in the subsequent years. The last follow-up date was 83rd month after sur-<lb/>gery. The postoperative projects were blood routine, blood biochemistry, laryngoscopy, neck <lb/>and chest CT, abdominal ultrasound. Postoperative recurrence was defined as the pathological <lb/>examination of laryngoscope biopsy or surgical resection. OS is defined as the time from the <lb/>surgery to the time of death from any cause. RFS is defined as the time from the surgery to the <lb/>time of recurrence. NLR is defined as absolute neutrophils count divided by lymphocyte count <lb/>(109/L). PLR is defined as absolute platelet count divided by lymphocyte count (109/L). Preop-<lb/>erative PLR is defined as the average of two preoperative PLR. Postoperative PLR is defined as <lb/>the average of PLR detected in the first three postoperative follow-up. PLR increase and <lb/>decrease were defined as postoperative PLR minus preoperative PLR was &gt; 0 and postopera-<lb/>tive PLR minus preoperative PLR &lt; 0, respectively. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>SPSS21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for statistical analysis. Continuous <lb/>variables were presented as the mean ± SD and compared by using the t-test for normal distri-<lb/>bution and Mann-Whitney U test for abnormal distribution. Chi-square test is used to com-<lb/>pare the covariate distribution. Survival curve was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and <lb/>Log-Rank test was performed to test the significance of the difference in survival distribution <lb/>between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox hazards analyses were used to evaluate the <lb/>relative effects of change of PLR on overall survival (OS) and (RFS). P &lt; 0.05 was considered <lb/>statistically significant. <lb/>Results <lb/>A total of 477 consecutive patients with LSCC were reviewed, and 362 patients were enrolled <lb/>in this study, including 39 female and 323 male. The mean age of patients was 49.1±12.2 years. <lb/>The differentiation of well, moderate, and poor was detected in 137, 109 and 116 patients, <lb/>respectively. 183 patients were diagnosed with T3 classification, whereas 179 were diagnosed <lb/>with the T4 classification. In addition, 112, 126 and 124 patients had experienced the total, sub-<lb/>total, and partial laryngectomy, respectively. The negative and positive surgical margins hap-<lb/>pened in 336 and 26 patients. 195 patients had increased PLR after surgery and 167 patients <lb/>suffering from decreased PLR. During follow-up, 185 patients suffered the recurrence, while <lb/>191 patients died(Table 1). <lb/>Univariate analyses (Table 2) showed that RFS is associated with the pathological T classifi-<lb/>cation, pathological N classification, and change of PLR. Multivariate analyses showed that <lb/>pathological T classification (HR = 1.878; 95% CI = 1.342-3.023; P&lt;0.001), pathological N <lb/>classification (HR = 1.212; 95% CI = 0.867-2.125; P&lt;0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.158; <lb/>95% CI = 1.332-2.889; P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for a worsened RFS(Table 3). <lb/>The 5-year RFS rates of patients with increased PLR was 32.5%, whereas those of patients with <lb/>decreased postoperative PLR was 68.4% (Fig 1A, P&lt;0.001). <lb/>Univariate analyses (Table 4) showed that pathological T classification, pathological N clas-<lb/>sification, and change of PLR were associated with OS after tumor resection. Pathological T <lb/>classification (HR = 1.901; 95% CI = 1.255-2.999; P&lt;0.001), pathological N classification <lb/>(HR = 1.244; 95% CI = 0.810-2.212; P&lt;0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.011; 95% CI = <lb/>1.354-2.753; P = 0.001) were demonstrated as independent prognostic factors for poor OS rate <lb/>in the multivariate analysis (Table 5). The 5-year OS rate was 41.6% in patients with increased <lb/>PLR and 71.4%, correspondingly, in patients with decreased PLR (Fig 1B, P&lt;0.001). <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>LSCC is a kind of malignant tumor with hoarseness, dysphagia and pharyngeal foreign body <lb/>sensation as the main symptoms. Because of the early symptoms are easy to be ignored by the <lb/>patients, the number of patients with T3-T4 LSCC continues to increase. Despite surgery and <lb/>postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis is still unsatisfactory. In this <lb/>study, we found that PLR is an independent predictor of RFS and OS of LSCC. <lb/>Platelets have long been considered key effector cells for hemostasis while identifying and <lb/>killing invading pathogens and releasing various mediators that regulate immune and <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>endothelial responses. But many previous studies have suggested that platelets may also con-<lb/>tribute to tumor migration and metastasis[13, 14]. Platelets protect tumor cells from immune <lb/>responses and promote cancer-related clotting, thereby promoting tumor growth and develop-<lb/>ment. In addition, platelets contain many proteins that regulate angiogenesis and secrete cyto-<lb/>kines and growth factors, such as VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and FGF, <lb/>leading to the development of the tumor, including angiogenesis, cell migration and, prolifera-<lb/>tion[15-17]. Clinical findings also suggest that the higher the number of platelets, the worse <lb/>the prognosis for cancer patients[18]. Lymphocytes are a special kind of white blood cells pro-<lb/>duced by lymphocytes. As an important part of host immune monitoring system, lymphocytes <lb/>play an important role in tumor growth and migration. It is well known that lymphocytes are <lb/>closely related to the outcome of cancer patients[19, 20]. Therefore, PLR may be a significant <lb/>prognostic indicator for cancer patients. <lb/>As a marker of tumor patients, thrombosis is the product of platelets and various blood <lb/>coagulation factors. Among various cytokines, IL-6 plays a key role in the formation of throm-<lb/>bosis[21, 22]. IL-6 stimulates the production of inflammatory cells, inhibits the amount of <lb/>albumin and the activity of enzymes involved in the synthesis of albumin in the liver. In addi-<lb/>tion, IL-6 can also stimulate the differentiation of megakaryocytes into platelets in the bone <lb/>marrow and increase the number of platelets in the body[23, 24]. In fact, the vascular endothe-<lb/>lial growth factor secreted by tumor cells also promotes platelet interactions with tumor cells, <lb/>thereby accelerating tumor proliferation and metastasis[25]. <lb/>PLR is associated with the prognosis of many cancer patients, including liver cancer, endo-<lb/>metrial cancer, and rectal cancer[26, 27]. Interestingly, PLR has also been shown to be a valu-<lb/>able prognostic marker for heart failure and cerebral hemorrhage[28, 29]. PLR has been <lb/>reported to be associated with the prognosis and mortality of patients with laryngeal cancer, <lb/>which is also consistent with our study. Surgery can stimulate stress state of the body, resulting <lb/>in the body including platelet, neutrophil, white blood cell changes, so that the inflammatory <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>state of the patient changes. In addition, surgical bleeding and infection can also result in the <lb/>release of various inflammatory factors and changes in the number of blood cells. The body <lb/>responds to changes in physiological status after tumor resection through changes in the inter-<lb/>nal environment. Therefore, some changes in inflammatory markers after surgery may be <lb/>more significant in predicting patients&apos; prognosis. Preoperative and postoperative PLR have <lb/>been reported as independent predictors of tumor patients, but it has been neglected that sur-<lb/>gery as a hemorrhagic injury has a significant impact on systemic inflammatory levels. In this <lb/>study, we considered the impact of surgery and confirmed that PLR changes were an indepen-<lb/>dent predictor of the prognosis of T3-T4 LSCC. With the increase of PLR after surgery, the <lb/>survival rate and recurrence rate of T3-T4 LSCC patients showed a significant upward trend. <lb/>However, the decreased PLR showed higher RFS and OS. <lb/>This study has some limitations. First, this is a single-center retrospective study. Second, <lb/>our study only involved patients with T3-T4 LSCC, whether this result is suitable for all LSCC <lb/>needs further study. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This study confirmed PLR&apos;s prediction of LSCC recurrence and mortality. The results show <lb/>that the changes of PLR have strong predictive significance for the prognosis of LSCC. In fact, <lb/>PLR, as a simple and obtained blood indicator, has significant significance in helping clinicians <lb/>with stratified treatment and prognosis prediction. <lb/>Table 4.
