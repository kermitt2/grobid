		<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Thermoelectric power ͑TEP͒ studies are of considerable <lb/>interest in the understanding the nature of the charge carriers <lb/>and transport mechanism in cuprate superconductors. De-<lb/>spite several TEP studies on various cuprate superconducting <lb/>systems, 1-4 discrepancies continue to exist. Uher et al. 1 and <lb/>Kaiser 2 argue in favor of electron-phonon enhancement in <lb/>the temperature dependence of metallic diffusion ther-<lb/>mopower. The idea of the presence of two types of carriers <lb/>was suggested by Uher et al. 1 in the hole-doped <lb/>La 2Ϫx Sr x CuO 4 superconductor system which exhibits a posi-<lb/>tive Hall coefficient as well as negative diffusion ther-<lb/>mopower. Lopez-Morales et al., 3 however, do not favor such <lb/>a separation of carriers into specific negative and positive <lb/>entities. Trodahl 4 attempted to explain thermopower features <lb/>using the usual Fermi-liquid picture. Nevertheless, the tem-<lb/>perature dependence of the TEP still remains unresolved. <lb/>According to this scenario, the discovery of an electron-<lb/>doped R 2Ϫx Ce x CuO 4Ϫ␦ ; RϭNd, Sm, or Pr superconductor <lb/>system becomes significant. 6,7 These superconductors are <lb/>considered to be potential candidates for the crucial test in <lb/>formulating theories to understand the mechanism of super-<lb/>conductivity as the majority charge carriers in superconduct-<lb/>ing cuprates can be either holes or electrons. Electrons are <lb/>apparently doped into the Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y ͑NCCO͒ system 6,8 <lb/>due primarily to ͑i͒ tetravalent Ce substitution for trivalent <lb/>Nd and ͑ii͒ creation of oxygen vacancy through reduction. <lb/>An increase in x leads to enhancement in conduction electron <lb/>density as Ce continues to be in mixed ͑3ϩ and 4ϩ͒ valence <lb/>states. 9,10 Eventually, for xϾ0.18, T c disappears. 6,11 <lb/>Interestingly, superconductivity gets revived in this sys-<lb/>tem when holes are nominally doped by the substitution of <lb/>divalent alkaline earth elements 12 for the trivalent Nd. This <lb/>result suggests that superconductivity is attained for certain <lb/>concentration of charge carriers and the majority of the car-<lb/>riers are electrons in both the parent NCCO and the revived <lb/>Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y ͑NSCCO͒ superconductor systems. <lb/>Our preliminary study showed that the thermopower sign is <lb/>negative, consistent with electron doping. 12,13 However, it is <lb/>not always negative in its sign, thereby posing difficulty in <lb/>explaining the very nature of the transport properties in these <lb/>materials. In this article, we present the results of our inves-<lb/>tigations on the NSCCO system, synthesized in different en-<lb/>vironments. <lb/>II. EXPERIMENTS <lb/>The Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y :р0.18 samples were syn-<lb/>thesized by the usual solid state reaction route. The synthesis <lb/>and characterization details are given elsewhere. An x-ray <lb/>diffraction ͑XRD͒ analysis revealed formation of the TЈ-type <lb/>structure and the presence of negligible impurities. The dc <lb/>four probe resistivity data were obtained in the temperature <lb/>range 5-300 K in a liquid helium bath cryostat using a car-<lb/>bon glass temperature sensor. The entire data acquisition sys-<lb/>tem, comprised of a ͑Keithley 181͒ nanovoltmeter, a ͑Kei-<lb/>thley 224͒ constant current source, a ͑Lakeshore model 82C͒ <lb/>temperature controller, and an indicator, was hooked to a HP <lb/>system controller. <lb/>a͒ <lb/>Present address: Nuclear Science Centre, Aruna Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi <lb/>110067, India. <lb/>b͒ Electronic mail: narlikar@csnpl.ren.nic.in <lb/></body>

		<body>TEP was measured by the differential method in the <lb/>temperature range 35-250 K using a closed cycle refrigera-<lb/>tor ͑CCR͒. 14 The sample, with a uniform surface, was <lb/>clamped between two thin copper plates that served as ref-<lb/>erence samples as well as voltage leads. The voltages were <lb/>measured using a Keithley nanovoltmeter and the tempera-<lb/>tures were recorded using silicon diode sensors attached to <lb/>the plates. The measured thermopower was corrected for the <lb/>͑Cu͒ reference material. A Mylar piece wrapping each sensor <lb/>ensured good thermal contact and electrical insulation. One <lb/>of the copper plates was placed on the cold head of the CCR <lb/>and the other one was kept in contact with the clamp that lies <lb/>in the open space of the vacuum chamber. While the system <lb/>is cooling down, temperature of the cold-head-facing sample <lb/>surface is lower than that at the upper face thereby establish-<lb/>ing a temperature gradient ͑⌬T, typically ϳ2 K͒ across the <lb/>sample. The variation in the temperature gradient ⌬T with <lb/>the lowering of temperature does not seem to affect the re-<lb/>sulting data. The reason is that the TEP goes to zero at Rϭ0 <lb/>͑as expected͒ in all the measurements carried out in our labo-<lb/>ratory using the same setup on the higher T c superconductors <lb/>such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7Ϫ␦ and Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O y and, more im-<lb/>portant, its TEP features compare exactly with those already <lb/>published in the literature. 14 The mean of the temperatures <lb/>read at the two sensors was chosen as the sample tempera-<lb/>ture. For such a temperature, the voltage difference (⌬V) <lb/>between the two terminals was noted to find out the TEP <lb/>ϭ(⌬V/⌬T). In this manner, the data were collected at the <lb/>temperature interval of ϳ0.5 K but the plots were made us-<lb/>ing a few data points for the sake of clarity. The overall error <lb/>in the TEP measurements is ϳ10%. All these steps were <lb/>done automatically as in the dc four-probe method. The sign <lb/>of the TEP was assigned using a conventional criterion: if <lb/>the absolute TEP of the reference metal is zero, the higher <lb/>temperature terminal will be positive potential with respect <lb/>to the lower temperature one, provided the TEP of the <lb/>sample under consideration is positive. <lb/>III. RESULTS <lb/>Figure 1 shows the normalized resistance R vs T plot, <lb/>where RϭR(T)/R(300) for the Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y : <lb/>xϭ0, 0.09, 0.18 ͑all reduced͒, and xϭ0.18 ͑oxygenated͒ <lb/>samples, designated as NCCO, Sr0.09, Sr0.18 and <lb/>Sr0.18͑O͒, respectively. The NCCO sample ͑curve a͒ shows <lb/>superconductivity onset only at 18 K and no Rϭ0 down to 5 <lb/>K. The normal state resistivity exhibits semiconductinglike <lb/>behavior. The Sr0.09 sample ͑curve b͒, on the other hand, <lb/>exhibits a T c onset at 20 K and Rϭ0 at 12 K. A more <lb/>interesting aspect of this sample is exhibition of a normal <lb/>state metalliclike behavior. The metallic behavior in the case <lb/>of electron-doped polycrystalline cuprates is rare, 15,16 indi-<lb/>cating the distinct feature of this ͑NSCCO͒ system. 12 For the <lb/>higher Sr concentration Sr0.18 sample ͑curve c͒ T c onset is <lb/>at 18 K and Rϭ0 at 8 K. The normal state behavior is <lb/>weakly semiconductinglike. The same sample when oxygen-<lb/>ated ͑curve d͒ shows only semiconductinglike resistivity be-<lb/>havior. <lb/>The thermopower S vs T of the NCCO, Sr0.09, Sr0.18, <lb/>and Sr0.18͑O͒ samples is shown in Fig. 2. All the reduced <lb/>samples reveal similar features in thermopower curves; the <lb/>magnitude of S is small and is comparable to that of noble <lb/>metals, electron-doped cuprates, and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 . 5,17,18 For <lb/>the NCCO and Sr0.09 samples, the sign of S is negative in <lb/>the entire temperature range of investigation, consistent with <lb/>electron doping. S suddenly increases below about 50 K sug-<lb/>gesting possible extrapolation to Sϭ0 at 12 K, ͓the observed <lb/>value of T c (Rϭ0)͔ and has a small dip at 55 K. The dip may <lb/>be compared with the phonon-drag peak observed in noble <lb/>metals and in some superconducting cuprates, often with <lb/>positive S values. 5,17 Surprisingly, the thermopower of the <lb/>NCCO sample with vanishing superconductivity ͑T c onset <lb/>ϳ18 K͒ shows an almost similar trend ͑cf. Refs. 11 and 12͒. <lb/>However, the magnitude of S is small, a typical characteristic <lb/>FIG. 1.

		<body>of metals. This feature is in contrast to the semiconducting-<lb/>like behavior exhibited by the sample in the R vs T plot ͓Fig. <lb/>1, curve ͑c͔͒. <lb/>The Sr0.18 sample exhibits almost linear S(T) from 250 <lb/>down to 110 K. Below 110 K, S increases faster and offsets <lb/>from negative to positive value at 75 K. Whether the value of <lb/>S would turn back to zero at T c ϳ18 K is not clear from these <lb/>data ͑the lowest temperature T measured being about 35 K͒. <lb/>On the contrary, after the sample is oxygenated, ͑i͒ the mag-<lb/>nitude of S is 6-8 times larger, ͑ii͒ the phonon-drag peak is <lb/>broadened, with positive S value, and ͑iii͒ the two offsets, <lb/>negative to positive at 110 K and positive to negative at <lb/>͑extrapolated͒ 30 K, are exhibited. However, the enhanced <lb/>magnitude of S is of the same order as that of good quality <lb/>hole superconductors 5 albeit the resistivity data ͓Fig. 1, curve <lb/>͑d͔͒ indicate semiconductinglike behavior. <lb/>IV. DISCUSSION <lb/>For a metal, the sign of diffusion thermopower (S d ) is <lb/>considered to be indicative of the sign of the majority charge <lb/>carriers, and S d is given by 17 <lb/>S d ϭϪ 2 k 2 T/3e͕‫͓ץ‬ln ͑E ͔͒/‫ץ‬E͖ E F , <lb/>͑1͒ <lb/>where (E) is the conductivity at electron energy E, k is <lb/>Boltzmann&apos;s constant, e is the electronic charge, and E F is <lb/>the Fermi energy. Equation ͑1͒ assumes ͑i͒ a common relax-<lb/>ation time for scattering in both a temperature gradient and <lb/>an electric field, ͑ii͒ elastic scattering in pure metals when <lb/>temperature TϾ D and in alloys when the resistance is <lb/>dominated by impurities, and ͑iii͒ no restriction on the shape <lb/>of the Fermi surface provided the Fermi energy E F ӷkT. <lb/>S d is a linear function of temperature; its magnitude and <lb/>sign depend on how the conductivity (E) changes with <lb/>electron energy at the Fermi surface. Generally, conductivity <lb/>is expected to increase with increasing energy of the elec-<lb/>trons, thereby, as a rule, negative thermopowers are expected <lb/>unless other conditions are imposed. The detailed behavior <lb/>of the diffusion thermopower of all metals and alloys there-<lb/>fore depends on 17 <lb/>͑E ͒ϭe 2 /4 3 ប 2 <lb/>ϫ ͭ ‫ץ‬ lnͫ ͵ ͵͑ ‫ץ‬E/‫ץ‬k͒ 2 ͑k͒dA/ٌ k Eͬ Ͳ ‫ץ‬E ͮ <lb/>E F <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>showing that S d is dependent on the Fermi surface through <lb/>(‫ץ‬E/‫ץ‬k) 2 and ٌ k E and on the scattering mechanism through <lb/>(k). Here k is the wave vector. Thus, interpretation of dif-<lb/>fusion thermopower is pretty difficult in the real physical <lb/>situation even for simple metals and alloys. As a result, lin-<lb/>earity of the thermopower with temperature is the theoretical <lb/>idealization. <lb/>The situation in the case of the Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y <lb/>system, therefore, should obviously be more challenging <lb/>than in other high Temperature Superconductors ͑HTSCs͒ 5 <lb/>because the dopants or oxygen nonstoichiometry are lattice <lb/>imperfections in the crystallites of the polycrystalline <lb/>samples. 19 These, in addition to the unaccounted for but un-<lb/>avoidable impurities, are expected to collectively contribute <lb/>to the thermopower for such materials. <lb/>Figure 2 depicts the T dependence of S for the various <lb/>samples. In the Sr0.09 superconducting sample, there is mar-<lb/>ginal, although nonlinear, T dependence. The NCCO and <lb/>Sr0.18 samples, on the other hand, show negligible T depen-<lb/>dence. The Sr0.18͑O͒ sample also exhibits nonlinearity. The <lb/>temperature dependence of thermopower of the <lb/>Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y materials, therefore, is not linear. <lb/>However, it may be mentioned that, in general, the S(T) <lb/>curves have dS/dTϽ0 ͑in the temperature range of 100-250 <lb/>K͒ in agreement with the earlier studies that diffusion is a <lb/>major contribution 13 to S. <lb/>We now consider contributions from the diffusion (S d ) <lb/>and phonon-drag (S g ) parts in the total thermopower S. This <lb/>can be expressed as 20 <lb/>SϭS d ϩS g ϭATϩBT 3 <lb/>or <lb/>S/TϭAϩBT 2 , <lb/>͑3͒ <lb/>where A and B are constants. Using this equation one can <lb/>extract the diffusive thermopower contribution S d through <lb/>the extrapolated intercept of the linear part of the S/T vs T 2 <lb/>plot. Such a plot also indicates the extent of S g contribution. <lb/>For this purpose, the S/T vs T 2 plots for the samples under <lb/>study are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, deviation from <lb/>linear behavior ͑i.e., the phonon-drag enhancement͒ begins <lb/>at temperatures ͑defined as T d ͒ 161, 179, 115, and 152 K for <lb/>the NCCO, Sr0.09, Sr0.18, and Sr0.18͑O͒ samples, respec-<lb/>tively. It is interesting to note that the extent of the phonon-<lb/>drag process is much larger ͑179 K͒ in the maximum T c <lb/>superconductor Sr0.09 than in that ͑115 K͒ of the Sr0.18 <lb/>sample. This is consistent with the general metallic and <lb/>semiconductinglike behavior of the materials. It is also <lb/>worth noting that, in the case of two semiconducting <lb/>samples, NCCO and Sr0.18͑O͒, T d is about 161 and 152 K, <lb/>respectively, which can be understood on the basis of their <lb/>composition and on synthesis conditions. The NCCO sample <lb/>synthesized under reducing conditions with maximum Ce <lb/>content possesses a high density electron concentration. On <lb/>the other hand, the Sr0.18͑O͒ sample prepared under an oxi-<lb/>dizing environment apparently overcompensates the electron <lb/>density generated through Ce incorporation, thereby leading <lb/>to a high density of hole concentration and thus behaving in <lb/>an almost opposite manner to the NCCO sample as far as the <lb/>phonon-drag part is concerned ͑Fig. 3͒. The small although <lb/>negative values of S encountered in the case of the Sr0.18͑O͒ <lb/>sample beyond the crossover at about 100 K indicates the <lb/>dominance of the electron contribution in the diffusive ther-<lb/>mopower region. <lb/>TEP, particularly that contributed from normal electrons <lb/>S that is also the case in the present study, is related to the <lb/>circulatory ( j ) and electronic ( e ) heat conductivities <lb/>j / e ϭ3eS⌬͑T͒/ 2 k 2 T, <lb/>͑4͒ <lb/>where ⌬(T) is the energy per normal carrier relative to the <lb/>superconducting carriers. Assuming that the normal carrier <lb/></body>

		<body>TEP (S) below T c is similar to just below it, the ratio <lb/>j / e ϰS. Using the Wiedmann-Franz law and the electrical <lb/>resistivity, Jezowski and Klamut 22 obtained only a very <lb/>small electronic contribution ͑2.5% at ϳ300 K and 0.1% at <lb/>30 K͒ to the total thermal conductivity. The thermal conduc-<lb/>tivity is thus clearly dominated by phonons and compares <lb/>well with those found in a classical dielectric solid. In other <lb/>words, thermal conductivity associated with the sharp peak <lb/>in the Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y system is extraordinarily large com-<lb/>pared to that in p-type cuprate superconductors. 22 This char-<lb/>acteristic may also be compared with the TEP dips ͑or peaks͒ <lb/>observed in the present samples as these features are found in <lb/>the temperature range where thermal conductivity also <lb/>peaks. However, the discrepancy lies in the peaks in <lb/>conductivity 22 and dips in the TEP of the reduced samples <lb/>that are exhibited. <lb/>Another focal point is the crossover of the TEP from <lb/>negative to positive value in the moderate temperature re-<lb/>gime where TEP diffusion dominates. In a recent theoretical <lb/>approach, model calculations were performed. In that <lb/>model, the simple free-electron scattering from the spherical <lb/>Fermi surface by acoustic phonons alone, without the usual <lb/>electron-phonon mass enhancement effect or Umklapp pro-<lb/>cess, was considered. Sign reversal in the TEP was shown to <lb/>have resulted from a competitive distribution of charge car-<lb/>riers of the different signs with the carriers being inelasti-<lb/>cally scattered. Further, the electron and phonon spectra are <lb/>considered to be on the same footing. Durczewski and <lb/>Ausloos 23 showed that the TEP bump ͑on the positive side͒ <lb/>grows with characteristic Debye energy or with decreasing <lb/>electron energy (⑀ s ), and is always negative for ⑀ s Ͼ48 K. <lb/>These characteristics can be compared with the TEP data of <lb/>the present work in Fig. 2, curves ͑c͒ and ͑d͒. The compari-<lb/>son is more striking in the case of the oxygenated sample <lb/>͓Fig. 2, curve ͑d͔͒. The TEP for the reduced sample ͓Fig. 2, <lb/>curve ͑c͔͒ is however not necessarily very compatible be-<lb/>cause it increases monotonically with decreasing temperature <lb/>down to 35 K. <lb/>We also note that the nonlinear S(T) is associated with <lb/>the decrease in dip as the Sr concentration (x) increases. The <lb/>dip decreases slowly with the introduction of superconduc-<lb/>tivity and may be correlated to the increased disorder due to <lb/>the increased x. 24-27 It is therefore tempting to say that the <lb/>thermopower of NSCCO is something more than the sum of <lb/>diffusion and phonon-drag components as it is in the <lb/>Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y system. 28 <lb/>Presumably both electrons and holes take part in the <lb/>conductivity of ͑NSCCO͒ materials. 12 It, therefore, raises a <lb/>question as to how these two kinds of charge carriers are <lb/>going to respond to the overall transport and electronic prop-<lb/>erties? The observation of a negative sign of thermopower is <lb/>indicative of electrons as the majority carriers that in turn <lb/>corroborates the x-ray spectroscopic ͑XAS͒ data ͑cf. Fig. 2 <lb/>of the Ce L 3 edge of Ref. 10͒. However, in some cases, the <lb/>thermopower offsets to positive value thereby making it dif-<lb/>ficult to understand the transport mechanism. 1-4 Uher et al. 1 <lb/>suggested the presence of two types of carriers in the <lb/>La 2Ϫx Sr x CuO 4 superconductor. Wang et al. 29 made similar <lb/>conclusions in the Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y system. But, Lopez-<lb/>Morales et al. 3 do not favor the idea of the separation of <lb/>carriers into specific negative and positive entities, in line <lb/>with the conclusions of Hu et al. 28 <lb/>For the NSCCO system there is, at present, no evidence <lb/>of the presence of two bands. 10 However, there is a system-<lb/>atic decrease in the unoccupied density of states with oxygen <lb/>depletion. 10 This tends to agree with better conductivity or <lb/>with superconductivity 12 which reflects the change in Fermi <lb/>level in the samples. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out <lb/>that two bands exist 30 in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu O y . This is evident <lb/>from the photoemission data that identify a band with the <lb/>Bi-O characteristic crossing the Fermi level and generating <lb/>an electronlike pocket to supplement the CuO plane holes. 30 <lb/>A similar model was also suggested for the Tl Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O y <lb/>system and was verified. 14,31 Precise understanding of the <lb/>thermopower of the NSCCO system is poor at this juncture <lb/>as it is in the other HTSCs. However, there are some ques-<lb/>tions to be addressed regarding the underlying physics that <lb/>may be hidden in material imperfections such as defects or <lb/>impurities. In Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y and Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y <lb/>systems, the local oxygen as well as cationic distributions <lb/>were investigated. 19,32 We report that, although the ͑cationic͒ <lb/>dopants are uniformly distributed, the lattice oxygen is non-<lb/>uniform locally which is believed to have far-reaching impli-<lb/>cations on the bulk physical properties of these materials. 19,32 <lb/>The oxygen distribution for the oxygenated samples ͑i.e., the <lb/>FIG. 3.

		<body>nonsuperconductors͒ is uniform as anticipated. Such samples <lb/>do not form a Fermi surface as is evident from the observed <lb/>semiconductinglike behavior ͓Fig. 1, curve ͑d͔͒. The reduced <lb/>samples, on the other hand, form Fermi surfaces, as is <lb/>strongly suggested by the observation of better conductivity <lb/>or superconductivity. 6,16,32 <lb/>At this juncture it would be beneficial to see the thermal <lb/>properties in a wider perspective. 33-36 Hansel et al. 33 re-<lb/>ported that the transport entropy of magnetic flux lines in <lb/>Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO y at 18 K in 0.5 T is 1.6ϫ10 Ϫ14 J/km, in <lb/>agreement with the time prediction of Ginzburg-Landau <lb/>theory. On the other hand, the Nernst effect of the same thin <lb/>film composition in the mixed state was found to arise from <lb/>the motion of the vortices in response to thermal force, and it <lb/>is anomalously large. 34 This led Jiang et al. 34 to conclude <lb/>that both electrons and holes participate in the electrical <lb/>transport of the superconducting phase of Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y . <lb/>This is, incidentally, coincidental with what Wang et al. <lb/>concluded. 29 The recent theoretical propositions for the ther-<lb/>mopower of semimetals and semiconductors that consider <lb/>the multiband structure and different types of carriers 37 ap-<lb/>parently describe the observed features of temperature de-<lb/>pendence of the TEP in the regime away from the usual low <lb/>temperature phonon-drag region of the high (xϭ0) and op-<lb/>timum (xϭ0.09) electron density samples ͓Fig. 2, curves ͑a͒ <lb/>and ͑b͔͒ where the majority carriers are doped electrons. <lb/>However, this does not seem to hold for the NSCCO system <lb/>as a whole. <lb/>The <lb/>reduced <lb/>samples <lb/>have <lb/>local <lb/>oxygen <lb/>nonuniformity 19,32 that suggests formation of different <lb/>shapes or sizes of Fermi surfaces locally. Therefore, the <lb/>Fermi surface, being the backbone in understanding the <lb/>mechanism of ͑super͒ conductivity or thermopower of such <lb/>materials delving into the Fermi surface topology, is ex-<lb/>pected to be quite revealing. However, in doing this, one <lb/>should consider the contrasting features of the semiconduct-<lb/>inglike behavior in the resistivity data and the metalliclike <lb/>small magnitude of thermopower in the oxygenated samples. <lb/>In this situation, one may visualize the resistivity and ther-<lb/>mopower arising from conduction by metallic and semicon-<lb/>ducting bands in parallel, 39 with the contribution of the semi-<lb/>conductor band to the total conductivity being small. Its <lb/>contribution to the total thermopower is, however, significant <lb/>owing to a very large intrinsic semiconductor thermopower. <lb/>V. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In summary, we have measured the thermopower S of <lb/>the revived n-type Nd 1.82Ϫx Sr x Ce 0.18 CuO y superconductors <lb/>for different x values. In the Sr0.09 sample, the magnitude of <lb/>S is highly metalliclike and the sign is negative, consistent <lb/>with electron conduction. However, in the Sr0.18 sample, S <lb/>offsets to a positive value below 75 K, in apparent conflict <lb/>with the electron conduction. Similar behavior is observed in <lb/>the case of oxygenated sample. These data show that Sr <lb/>codoping is not a simple addition of holes. Based on the <lb/>estimation of the extent of diffusion thermopower, oxygen-<lb/>ation of the Sr0.18 sample seems to have overcompensated <lb/>the electron density in the material, thereby causing it to <lb/>behave in a mirror-imagelike fashion compared to the NCCO <lb/>sample. The thermopower behavior of the high and optimum <lb/>electron density samples seems to qualitatively match the <lb/>theoretical curves generated for the thermopower of semi-<lb/>metals and semiconductors by Durczewski and Ausloos. Fur-<lb/>ther, the thermopower sign reversal in the reduced and oxy-<lb/>genated (xϭ0.18) samples may be viewed in light of the <lb/>other recent theory by these authors. <lb/></body>
