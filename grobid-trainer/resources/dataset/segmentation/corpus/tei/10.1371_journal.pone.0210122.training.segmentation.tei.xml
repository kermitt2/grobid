The world is presently experiencing a <lb/>series of outbreaks of these diseases, so, we still require to better understand the current <lb/>distributions and possible future shifts of their vectors for successful surveillance and control <lb/>programs. Few studies assessed the influences of climate change on the spatial distribu-<lb/>tional patterns and abundance of these important vectors, particularly using the most recent <lb/>climatic scenarios. Here, we updated the current potential distributions of both vectors and <lb/>assessed their distributional changes under future climate conditions. <lb/>Methods <lb/>We used ecological niche modeling approach to estimate the potential distributions of Ae. <lb/>aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future climate conditions. This approach <lb/>fits ecological niche model from occurrence records of each species and environmental vari-<lb/>ables. For each species, future projections were based on climatic data from 9 general circu-<lb/>lation models (GCMs) for each representative concentration pathway (RCP) in each time <lb/>period, with a total of 72 combinations in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. All ENMs were tested <lb/>using the partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) and a set of 2,048 and 2,003 addi-<lb/>tional independent records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively.

All ecological niche models (ENMs) were statisti-<lb/>cally robust (P &lt; 0.001). ENMs successfully anticipated 98% (1,999/2,048) and 99% (1,985/ <lb/>2,003) of additional independent records for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respec-<lb/>tively (P &lt; 0.001).

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The yellow fever mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) and the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Ste-<lb/>gomyia) albopictus (Skuse) are two major vectors of several arboviruses [1, 2]. These viruses <lb/>include dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika <lb/>virus (ZIKV) which are widely distributed across tropics and subtropics regions of the world [3-<lb/>6]. Arboviruses infect millions of cases annually across the world where almost half of the world&apos;s <lb/>population is at risk of infection with these deadly threats [7-9]. The global emergence of these <lb/>arboviruses was associated with pathogen, vector, host, and environmental interactions [10, 11]. <lb/>Previous studies recognized several factors to influence arboviral disease emergence; these factors <lb/>possibly include further expansion of suitable vector habitats, viral genetic mutations, anthropo-<lb/>logical behavior, poor sanitary services, commercial transportation, and socioeconomic and land <lb/>cover changes [2, 11-14]. This rapid emergence and spread of these deadly arboviruses are always <lb/>associated with the lack of commercially available antivirals or vaccines [6, 15]. <lb/>Aedes aegypti was probably originated in Sub-Saharan Africa from a wild, and zoophilic <lb/>ancestral species named Ae. aegypti formosus [16]. Recently, Ae. aegypti has been introduced <lb/>and established in much of the tropical and subtropical regions owing to globalization and <lb/>human activities [2, 17]. Aedes albopictus was native to Southeast Asia, islands of Indian Ocean <lb/>and the western Pacific [18, 19]. Recently, Ae. albopictus caused public threats by expanding its <lb/>range to Africa, Europe, and the Americas via human activities and active transportations [19, <lb/>20]. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are invasive and container-breeding mosquitoes [12]. <lb/>Aedes aegypti feeds almost mainly on humans during daylight and rests indoors [21]. Aedes <lb/>albopictus alternatively feeds on humans and animals opportunistically and tends to rest out-<lb/>doors [22] but has also been shown to exhibit strongly anthropophagic behavior like Ae. <lb/>aegypti [19, 20, 23]. <lb/></body>

			<body>The global distributional potential of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was found to be limited <lb/>by several factors [1, 12]. These factors include climate, socioeconomic factors, and interspe-<lb/>cific competition between the two species [1, 12]. Thus, the climatic changes and elevated car-<lb/>bon emissions may drive rapid changes in the global distribution of these vector species and <lb/>allow several introduction events into new regions of the world. All these changes may trigger <lb/>the rapid emergence of several arboviral diseases globally [24-26]. So, we still require to better <lb/>understand the current distributions and possible future shifts of these two species for success-<lb/>ful surveillance and control programs of several arboviruses across the world [2]. Here, we <lb/>updated the global potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus using the ecological <lb/>niche modeling approach. We also compared the niches of both species and identified the cli-<lb/>mate change influences on their global distribution under different emission scenarios in 2050 <lb/>and 2070. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Occurrence records <lb/>We drew all occurrence records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from the previously pub-<lb/>lished literature [2, 27]. We avoided using the occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity <lb/>Information Facility (GBIF) and the VectorMap data portal for two reasons; 1) lack of detailed <lb/>spatial uncertainty associated with each record available via GBIF and VectorMap portals, 2) <lb/>GBIF duplicated the same dataset retrieved from literature [2, 27]. We downloaded an initial <lb/>set of 19,929 and 22,137 occurrence records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. <lb/>We reduced these datasets using a variety of quality-control and cleaning steps to reduce any <lb/>possible bias in calibrating ecological niche models (ENMs). First, we excluded records with <lb/>higher spatial uncertainty and included only occurrences with exact geographic coordinates in <lb/>the final dataset. Second, we removed duplicate records, so, only unique records were pre-<lb/>sented in the final occurrences for each species. The initial set of occurrences consists of <lb/>13,991 and 17,280 records with the exact sampling coordinate for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albobic-<lb/>tus, respectively. We removed duplicate records from this set, so, the data yielded only 4,251 <lb/>and 3,341 unique records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Finally, we filtered <lb/>these occurrences based on a distance filter to omit all redundant records occurring in a single <lb/>2.5&apos; pixel (� 5 km) [28, 29]. We divided randomly the final occurrence dataset for each species <lb/>into two halves; 50% for model calibration, and 50% for model evaluation. <lb/>Climatic data <lb/>To characterize the current global climate, we used bioclimatic data v. 1.4 available from the <lb/>WorldClim archive (www.worldclim.org). The WorldClim data include 19 bioclimatic variables <lb/>originally derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values collected from the worldwide <lb/>weather stations during 1950-2000. We used 2.5 0 spatial resolution (� 5 kilometers) in light of <lb/>the global extent of our analysis. For future data, we obtained parallel datasets for diverse general <lb/>circulation models (GCMs) from four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) during <lb/>2050 and 2070 to account for possible distributional changes of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus <lb/>under different scenarios and time periods. Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are <lb/>scenarios that describe alternative trajectories for CO 2 emissions and the resulting atmospheric <lb/>concentration available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5); <lb/>the lowest anthropogenic radiative forcing level scenario RCP 2.6, two median range or stabili-<lb/>zation scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0, and a comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions RCP <lb/>8.5. We used 9 GCMs (S1 File) for each RCP in each time period, with a total of 72 combina-<lb/>tions (i.e. 9 GCMs x 4 RCPs x 2 time periods) in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. <lb/></body>

			<body>Bioclimatic variables 8-9 and 18-19 were omitted from the analysis, considering the <lb/>known spatial artifacts in these variables. The remaining of 15 variables were submitted to a <lb/>principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality and multicollinearity <lb/>between these variables [28, 29]. The component loadings in the present-day data were used to <lb/>transform future-climate data using the PCA Projection script written in R software version <lb/>3.2.0 [30]. <lb/>Ecological niche modeling <lb/>We used the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in M AXENT v3.3.3e [31] to predict <lb/>the distributional potential of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future <lb/>conditions. M AXENT is used to fit species distribution models from occurrence records and <lb/>environmental variables. All models were based on the first 8 principal components (PCs) <lb/>described above in the previous analysis; the first 8 PCs summarized more than 99.99% of the <lb/>overall variance to summarize environmental variation across the world. A crucial step in cali-<lb/>brating the ENMs is determining the calibration area for each species under the analysis [32, <lb/>33]. This area is defined as the accessible area &quot;M&quot; that have been accessible to the species. We <lb/>estimated a very broad accessible area &quot;M&quot; for each species considering their apparent invasive <lb/>potential [1, 2]; accessible areas were estimated for both species as much of the world (i.e. <lb/>between 50.79˚N and 60.96˚S, and 54.67˚N and 41.51˚S for Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus, <lb/>respectively). <lb/>In M AXENT , we used 50% of calibration points for training, with <lb/>10 bootstrapped replicates chosen with a random seed. We used M AXENT with clamping <lb/>and extrapolation deactivated to avoid the risk of over-prediction in non-analogous environ-<lb/>ments [33]. <lb/>To summarize the model results under present-day conditions, we used the median values <lb/>across all runs as an estimate to the ecological niche of each species. For future conditions, we <lb/>calculated medians across all medians of all single GCMs. The final models were thresholded <lb/>based on a maximum allowable omission error rate of 5% (E = 5%; [34]), assuming that up to <lb/>5% of occurrence data may include errors that misrepresented environmental values. We esti-<lb/>mated the uncertainty index of the model predictions via an approach described elsewhere <lb/>[28]. For present-day conditions, the uncertainty index was derived from the range (maxi-<lb/>mum-minimum) of predictions in 10 replicate runs in M AXENT (i.e. uncertainty derived <lb/>from bootstrapped sets of occurrences in M AXENT samples). For the future conditions, an <lb/>uncertainty index of future model predictions was calculated as the range across all combina-<lb/>tions of GCMs in each RCP (i.e. uncertainty derived from the difference in predictions among <lb/>different GCMs in each RCP). <lb/>Model evaluation <lb/>We evaluated the niche models of both species via two approaches; 1) partial receiver operating <lb/>characteristic (pROC) statistics applied to the 50% subset of occurrences left out before model <lb/>calibration for testing. We chose pROC as a significance test in light of critiques of the appro-<lb/>priateness of traditional ROC approaches [34, 35]; pROC avoids possible errors raised with tra-<lb/>ditional ROC provided in M AXENT outputs. pROC statistics were calculated using the <lb/>PartialROC function available in ENMGadgets package based on 1000 iterations. 2) For fur-<lb/>ther evaluation of model robustness to predict the occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, <lb/>we used a set of 2,048 and 2,003 additional occurrence records, respectively. These additional <lb/>records were obtained from data discarded during early phases of data filtering of the original <lb/>dataset [2, 27] and ones from WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region [36]. We used a one-tailed <lb/></body>

			<body>cumulative binomial probability test to assess the probability of obtaining the observed level of <lb/>correct predictions by chance alone given the background expectation of correct predictions <lb/>determined by the proportional coverage of the study area by regions of predicted suitability. <lb/>Niche overlap of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus <lb/>We used background similarity test [37] to assess the similarity between the ecological niches <lb/>of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We first estimated the accessible area (M) for each species in <lb/>the study [37]; the accessible area for both species was defined as in the previous sections. <lb/>To test the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both niches, we used D-statistics and <lb/>Hellinger&apos;s I implemented in ENMTools [37]. Niche similarity was tested with respect to all <lb/>environmental variables used to develop the ENM for each species. The background similarity <lb/>test is based on generating random points from across the accessible area of one species in <lb/>numbers equal to the numbers of real occurrence data available for that species in the study, <lb/>with 100 replicate samples, and comparing an ENM based on these &quot;background&quot; points to <lb/>the ENM of the other species. The null hypothesis of niche similarity was rejected if the D or I <lb/>values fell below the 5 th percentile in the random-replicate distribution of similarity values <lb/>[37]. Finally, we visualized the overlap between both species in 3-dimensional space based on <lb/>the first three principal components (PCs; the first 3 PCs presents 99.46% of the overall vari-<lb/>ance) using the software Niche A [38]. <lb/>Results <lb/>We assembled a total of 2,303 and 1,427 unique occurrence records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopic-<lb/>tus, respectively after detailed cleaning of the initial dataset (Fig 1). Most of the occurrence records <lb/>are geographically distributed across Asia and Americas; &gt; 55% of Ae. aegypti records occurred in <lb/>Brazil, India, Thailand, Mexico, and United States. For Ae. albopictus, &gt; 67% records occurred <lb/>only in Taiwan, United States, and Indonesia. The final dataset of occurrences used for analysis is <lb/>available via online repository available at https://figshare.com/s/6b18c6ce273a3ecaaddc. <lb/>The predicted potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coincided consider-<lb/>ably with the current and historical known distributions of both species. The geographic distri-<lb/>bution of both species coincided in some areas in Asia, and West Africa; however, both species <lb/>differed markedly in Europe, East Africa, United States, and Australia (Fig 2). Aedes aegypti <lb/>showed a markedly broader distributional potential across tropical and subtropical regions <lb/>than Ae. albopictus. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus was markedly broader in distributional poten-<lb/>tial across temperate Europe and United States. <lb/>In Americas, the distributional potential of Ae. aegypti was observed in much of South <lb/>America. The environmentally suitable areas of Ae. aegypti included the Caribbean islands, <lb/>most of Southeast USA, and along a narrow zone in the Pacific coasts of Canada and USA. <lb/>Indeed, Ae. albopictus showed a broader distribution in the continental USA but narrower <lb/>distributional potential across South America (Fig 2); Ae. albopictus broadly extended from <lb/>Southeast to North USA and South Canadian border. <lb/>In Europe, Ae. aegypti was predicted to occur in a limited narrow zone along the Mediterra-<lb/>nean coast of Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Albania, Italy, Spain, France, and the Atlantic <lb/>coasts of Portugal. Interestingly, all Spanish islands in the Atlantic Ocean were environmen-<lb/>tally suitable for Ae. aegypti occurrence (S2 File). Ae. albopictus showed expanded distribu-<lb/>tional potential across much of Western Europe and the Balkan region. <lb/>In Africa, Ae. aegypti was widely distributed across Sub-Saharan countries; however, its <lb/>distributional potential is very limited in Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, Angola, and Zam-<lb/>bia. Indeed, Ae. aegypti was also predicted across West Morocco and Western Sahara, North <lb/></body>

The distribu-<lb/>tional potential of Ae. albopictus was markedly narrower across East Africa; however, the spe-<lb/>cies occurred across the Mediterranean coast extending from Morocco to Egypt (S4 File). <lb/>Indeed, environmentally suitable conditions of Ae. albopictus were identified also on the Red <lb/>Sea coast in Egypt (S5 File). <lb/>In Asia, Ae. aegypti showed distributional patterns across much of the continent including <lb/>Central and Southern Asia. The predicted distributional potential of Ae. aegypti included also <lb/>much of Oceania, Northern Australia, Eastern and Western coasts of Australia and New Zea-<lb/>land.

			<body>Transferring the calibrated models of both species to the future showed a similarity between <lb/>the overall distributional patterns of future-day and present-day conditions (Figs 3 and 4, S7 and <lb/>S8 Files); however, there were few differences in the predictions. Indeed, a northern range expan-<lb/>sion was observed in continental USA for both species and expanded further to include parts of <lb/>Southern Canada in case of Ae. albopictus in both 2050 and 2070 (Fig 4, S8 File). We anticipated <lb/>further expansion of Ae. albopictus to the East to include most Europe in both time periods. Aedes <lb/>aegypti was anticipated to expand to the South in East Australia in 2050 and 2070. <lb/>The predictions showed differences between diverse RCPs in 2050 and 2070 (Figs 3 and 4, <lb/>S7 and S8 Files); both species is anticipated to increase from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5 and from <lb/>2050 to 2070. Between the present-day and 2050, the potential distribution area of Ae. aegypti <lb/>increased by 1.89%, 2.38%, 2.60%, and 3.02% under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, <lb/>respectively. Between the present day and 2070, the potential distributional area of Ae. aegypti <lb/>was anticipated to increase by 2.25%, 2.84%, 3.03%, and 4.47% under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP <lb/>6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively. For Ae. albopictus, the overall distributional potential was antic-<lb/>ipated to increase by 1.56%, 2.24%, 2.30%, 2.70% under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP <lb/>8.5, respectively between the present-day and 2050. Between the present-day and 2070, the <lb/>potential distribution area of Ae. albopictus increased by 2.17%, 2.88%, 3.01%, and 4.21% <lb/>under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively. We provided detailed maps of <lb/>potential distributions under each individual GCM via the supplementary materials; the final <lb/>future projections are summarized as a GeoTIFF data file at https://figshare.com/s/ <lb/>6b18c6ce273a3ecaaddc. <lb/>Detailed maps of model stability for both species illustrated differences among diverse <lb/>RCPs in 2050, and 2070 (Figs 5 and 6; S7 and S8 Files). For Ae. aegypti, the highest stability of <lb/>the models among present-day and future conditions appeared in the belt between 37˚S and <lb/>35˚N, which include South America, Southern USA, Sub-Saharan Africa, Red Sea coast, and a <lb/>narrow zone in West and North Africa, South Asia, and North Australia (Fig 5; S9 File). Areas <lb/>with higher agreement among diverse GCMs included parts of Northern South America, <lb/>Northern USA, Western Africa, Western Saudi Arabia, and Eastern China. <lb/>Aedes albopictus showed high agreement between present-day and future conditions in <lb/>South America, Eastern USA, Western Europe, Central and South Asia; however, Northern <lb/>USA, and Eastern Europe were characterized as areas with higher agreement among all GCMs <lb/>in both time periods (Fig 6; S10 File). <lb/>Under present-day conditions, both species showed variation in uncertainty index among <lb/>different regions (S11 File). Aedes aegypti showed higher uncertainty in parts of Southern <lb/>coast of US, East Africa, parts of Southeast Asia whereas low uncertainty was observed in <lb/>North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, and Central and North Amer-<lb/>ica (S11 File). For Ae. albopictus, higher uncertainty was observed in North Africa, West <lb/>Africa, West of the Red Sea coast, narrow zones in Europe and North America. Lower uncer-<lb/>tainty was observed in North America, most continental Africa, Asia, and Europe. <lb/>Under future conditions, the level of uncertainty varied among different time periods and <lb/>diverse RCPs for both species. Highest variation in model predictions for Ae. aegypti across all <lb/>RCPs was observed in Eastern China, Southern USA, Northern South America. Aedes albopic-<lb/>tus also showed high variation at diverse places across the Americas, parts of Europe, and East-<lb/>ern Asia. <lb/>The background similarity test comparing the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was <lb/>unable to reject the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both species (P &gt; 0.05; Fig 7). <lb/>We used NicheA to visualize overall overlap between the two species based on three dimen-<lb/>sions of PCs (Fig 8), which revealed broad overlap in environmental conditions used by both <lb/>species. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>The present study provided the most updated and detailed maps of the current global potential <lb/>distributions of two arboviral vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and anticipated their <lb/>potential distributions under changing climate. These maps provided significant public health <lb/>importance for several reasons; 1) they estimate probabilities of occurrences for two primary <lb/>vectors of major arboviruses that are increasingly spread across the world, 2) they examine the <lb/>possible climate change influences on the distributional potential of key disease vectors, and 3) <lb/>they provide a primary source for maps used to prioritize surveillance and control programs of <lb/>both vectors and Aedes-borne diseases. <lb/>Two major studies previously identified the global distributional potential of Ae. aegypti <lb/>and Ae. albopictus [1, 2]. One of these studies recognized lack of occurrence data and signifi-<lb/>cantly underestimated the potential distribution of these species [1]. The rest of studies used a <lb/>similar set of occurrences; however, these occurrences have duplicated records, and others that <lb/>are of uncertainty greater than pixel size (i.e. scale mismatch between sampling sites and spa-<lb/>tial resolution of climatic variables); correction of these problems should lead to higher model <lb/>performance [39, 40]. Here, we updated the ecological niches of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus <lb/>based on thinned and unbiased occurrence records with the exact sampling localities; we <lb/>Fig 7.

The vertical blue line shows <lb/>observed niche overlap, and the histograms show the distribution of the background similarity values among 100 random replicates, for the I and D similarity metrics. <lb/>On the maps, dark gray and light red shading indicates the modeled suitable areas for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively; dark purple shading shows areas of <lb/>overlap between the two species. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210122.g007 <lb/></body>

			<body>cleaned occurrences and used the unique records that presented the accurate sampling sites. <lb/>Our ENMs improved the predictions of both species; these ENMs are statistically robust and <lb/>predicted most additional independent records for both species. Interestingly, these models <lb/>predicted about 98% and 99% of additional records of Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus, respec-<lb/>tively. The presence of these species were recently confirmed via active surveillance of these <lb/>two vectors in the same regions anticipated by our models [41-44]. <lb/>Our models were the first to look more closely for the distributional patterns of Ae. aegypti <lb/>in Spanish islands, Chile, and the Red Sea coast in Egypt and Sudan where recent outbreaks of <lb/>arboviral diseases were reported [44]. Recent surveillance of Ae. aegypti suggested known pres-<lb/>ences of this species in almost all of these regions [44, 45]. Aedes albopictus model concurs <lb/>with recent surveillance of this invasive species across the world [41, 43]; our models <lb/>Fig 8.

			<body>anticipated new areas in North Africa, Canada (e.g., Ontario), and United Kingdom where the <lb/>species was also identified [42, 43, 46]. Here, the study added another dimension of novelty by <lb/>using the most updated version of climatic scenarios rather than using the previous version of <lb/>future climatic models as implemented in the previous study [1]. <lb/>The results of our models overlap in most cases with the previously published models by <lb/>Kraemer and colleagues [2]; however, our models recognized different distributional patterns <lb/>to the one predicted by Campbell et al. [1]. The latter study [1] underestimated occurrences of <lb/>both species in many areas where both species are abundant [18, 27, 42-45]. For example, <lb/>Campbell and colleagues [1] underestimated Ae. aegypti in South Western Africa, Arabian <lb/>Peninsula, India, and China and Ae. albopictus in Europe, North Africa, Australia, and Eastern <lb/>Brazil. Surprisingly, our models added some additional sites to the ones predicted by these pre-<lb/>vious studies [1, 2]. In this study, an additional distributional potential of Ae. aegypti was <lb/>observed in other regions including New Zealand, Oman, Yemen, North Africa, Western <lb/>Sahara, Northern coasts of Spain, Western South of France, Mediterranean coasts of Turkey, <lb/>Chile, and the Western coasts of Canada. Indeed, Ae. aegypti was sampled previously from <lb/>some of these sites [42, 45, 47, 48]. For Ae. albopictus models, we still see incongruences <lb/>between our models and the ones published previously in regards to the environmental suit-<lb/>ability predicted by our model in several regions in New Zealand, Southern Australia, Yemen, <lb/>Western Saudi Arabia, Africa, Western Europe, and Chile; all previous models [1, 2] underesti-<lb/>mated the distributional potential of Ae. albopictus in Europe. These previous studies failed to <lb/>better estimate the distributional potential of both species owing to either lack of occurrence <lb/>data [1] or biased dataset with associated uncertainties of occurrences [2]. <lb/>The population dynamics and distribution potential of Ae. Aegypti and Ae. albopictus <lb/>proved to respond positively to elevated temperature [19, 49]. Indeed, both species revealed <lb/>the potential for range expansion under changing climate. The latter may trigger the invasion <lb/>of those species to new habitats where climate and resources allow the establishment of new <lb/>populations of the two species [50]. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were anticipated to invade <lb/>new sites or re-emerge in other sites, for example, the ranges of both species were predicted to <lb/>expand further to include Canada, other sites in Europe, and parts of the Middle East and <lb/>North Africa. These distributional patterns coincided with the patterns observed previously <lb/>for the same vector species [12, 18, 27, 42-45]. <lb/>The global distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were proved to be influenced <lb/>mainly by the climatic conditions [1, 2]. Therefore, under the current and future climatic con-<lb/>ditions, the distribution patterns of both species was shown to be concentrated in the tropical <lb/>and subtropical regions, with a dominant distribution of Ae. albopictus over the temperate <lb/>regions whereas Ae. aegypti showed wider distribution over the tropical and subtropical <lb/>regions (Fig 2). Although weather and climatic factors are important drivers for establishing <lb/>the population of Ae. aegypti as well as Ae. albopictus [49, 51], these mosquitoes also depend <lb/>on the presence of water containers for oviposition and larval development. This concurs with <lb/>human-related activities in rainfall periods or drought periods where lack of water resources is <lb/>predominant [12]. These human activities are important drivers of mosquito population <lb/>dynamics by adding new breeding sites via water storage in tanks. <lb/>Aedes albopictus showed notable suitability over Ae. aegypti in temperate climate (Fig 2) <lb/>concurring with species occurrence in the temperate regions, the same result was anticipated <lb/>by a previous study [2]. The climatic factors in temperate regions are significantly different <lb/>from the characteristic tropical and subtropical climate where the two species occurred. The <lb/>latter suggested the occurrence of other factors affecting the distribution of the two species; <lb/>these factors may include biotic factors, for example, possible interspecific competition <lb/>between both species under the study. <lb/></body>

			<body>Interestingly, both species under the analyses might occupy similar ecological niches (Figs 7 <lb/>and 8). The latter finding is parallel with several other studies that recognized Ae. aegypti and <lb/>Ae. albopictus as sympatric species; both species tend to breed in similar habitats [52, 53]. Com-<lb/>petitive displacement is possibly occurred between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, for example, <lb/>Ae. albopictus has the competitive advantage under local field conditions in North American <lb/>populations [54]. The latter possibly contributed to the displacement of Ae. aegypti in some <lb/>localities of the continental USA, possibly after the invasion of Ae. albopictus. This pattern could <lb/>be indistinguishable to what occurred in Europe; Ae. aegypti populations in Europe may be dis-<lb/>placed by Ae. albopictus owing to the interspecific competition. This displacement may be <lb/>related to several factors [22, 54-56]. First, Ae. albopictus maintains a strong ecological and <lb/>physiological plasticity that allows for its strong capacity to adapt rapidly to wide varieties of <lb/>habitats [22, 55]; this adaptation may include cold temperatures where the species becomes dor-<lb/>mant during the winter of temperate regions [22, 55]. Second, the cross-insemination occurred <lb/>naturally between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and the sterilizing effects of male accessory <lb/>gland products [54, 56]. The latter favors Ae. albopictus in interspecific mating and support <lb/>satyrization which presumably explain the rapid displacements and fitness reduction owing to <lb/>drastic reproductive loss of Ae. aegypti females satyrized by Ae. albopictus males [54, 56]. <lb/>This study updated the potential distribution of both species; however, it identified some <lb/>limitations; 1) absence of human-based variables in model calibration, and 2) models didn&apos;t <lb/>consider the component of interspecific competition between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. <lb/>Johnson et al. [50] excluded human population as a predictor in their model considering that <lb/>even rural areas typically have a population that able to support Ae. aegypti under favorable cli-<lb/>matic conditions. Alternatively, another study identified human population as a key factor to <lb/>shape the ecological niche of at least Ae. aegypti [57]. The inclusion of these factors to the <lb/>model will allow better predictions; however, lack of parallel future data remains a gap in <lb/>knowledge, particularly when we project these models to the future. <lb/>In summary, our study improved the distributional potential of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopic-<lb/>tus and placed several other regions at risk of vector invasions. The latter may trigger emer-<lb/>gence and re-emergence of several diseases to new and historical sites, respectively. These <lb/>diseases included ones of major public health concerns, particularly dengue, chikungunya, as <lb/>well as Zika. The invasion of these species placed several new areas at risk of these deadly dis-<lb/>eases, particularly in the Middle East [36]. <lb/></body>
