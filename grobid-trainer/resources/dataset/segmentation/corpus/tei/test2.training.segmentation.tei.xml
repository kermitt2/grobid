Whilst previous studies have <lb/>demonstrated differences in gene expression, here, we investigated if there are within patient changes in the expression of <lb/>oestrogen-and progesterone-regulated genes (ERGs and PRGs) and PAGs in ER+ breast cancer during the menstrual cycle. Samples <lb/>from 96 patients in two independent prospective studies of the effect of menstrual cycle on ER+ breast cancer were used. Plasma <lb/>hormone measurements were used to assign tumours to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle windows: W1 (days 27-35 and <lb/>1-6; low oestradiol and low progesterone), W2 (days 7-16; high oestradiol and low progesterone) and W3 (days 17-26; <lb/>intermediate oestradiol and high progesterone). RNA expression of 50 genes, including 27 ERGs, 11 putative PRGs and seven PAGs <lb/>was measured. The AvERG (geomean of PGR, GREB1, TFF1 and PDZK1) was used as a composite measure of ERG expression and <lb/>showed significant changes between the three windows of the menstrual cycle increasing over 2.2-fold between W1 and W2 and <lb/>decreasing between W2 and W3 and between W3 and W1. Proliferation gene expression also varied significantly, following the <lb/>same pattern of changes as ERG expression, but the changes were of lower magnitude (1.4-fold increase between W1 and W2). <lb/>Significant changes in the expression of eight individual ERGs, including GREB1, PGR and TFF1, and two PAGs were observed <lb/>between W1 and either W2 or W3 with all genes showing higher levels in W2 or W3 (1.3-2.4-fold; FDR 0.016-0.05). The AvProg, a <lb/>composite measure of PRG expression, increased significantly (1.5-fold) in W3 compared to W1 or W2 but no significant changes <lb/>were observed for individual PRGs. In conclusion, we observed significant changes in ERG, PRG and PAG expression in ER+ breast <lb/>tumours during the menstrual cycle that may affect the assessment and interpretation of prominent biomarkers (e.g. PgR) and <lb/>commonly used multigene prognostic signatures in premenopausal ER+ breast cancer. <lb/>npj Breast Cancer (2019) 5:42 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41523-019-0138-2 <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>In premenopausal women, oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) <lb/>disease constitutes over 80% of breast cancers. 1 The vast majority <lb/>of these patients will receive endocrine therapy, often by ovarian <lb/>ablation, although ER status is an imperfect predictor of response <lb/>to this therapy. In the postmenopausal setting, short-term <lb/>withdrawal of oestrogens using an aromatase inhibitor for two <lb/>weeks between a woman&apos;s diagnosis and surgery has been used <lb/>to assess the oestrogen dependence of ER+ breast cancers. 2-5 <lb/>However, it is not feasible to conduct a similar pharmacological <lb/>pre-surgical test in premenopausal patients as the drugs used, <lb/>tamoxifen or gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists, often <lb/>display early biochemical &quot;flare&quot; which would obscure molecular <lb/>changes over the first few weeks. 6,7 As an alternative way of <lb/>measuring a tumour&apos;s oestrogen-dependency in the premeno-<lb/>pausal setting, we hypothesised that if there are predictable and <lb/>consistent differences in the expression of oestrogen-regulated <lb/>genes (ERGs) and proliferation-associated genes (PAGs) in <lb/>hormone-responsive ER+ breast tumours in premenopausal <lb/>women due to the large variations in plasma concentrations of <lb/>oestrogen (c.100pM to c.1000pM) and progesterone (&lt;3 nM to <lb/>&gt;50 nM) during the menstrual cycle, the absence of such change <lb/>could signify hormone insensitivity. This was driven by the <lb/>observation that the expression of ERGs in ER+ breast tumours <lb/>correlated strongly with circulating levels of oestradiol in <lb/>postmenopausal women. 8 <lb/>In a retrospective study we found ERG expression to be <lb/>50-200% higher in mid-to late cycle (days 7-26), when oestrogen <lb/>levels are higher, compared to very late or earlier in the cycle (days <lb/>27-35 and 1-6) when oestrogen levels are lower. 9 PAGs appeared <lb/>to have a lower level of expression in the progesterone-dominated <lb/>luteal phase of the cycle. 10 We also demonstrated that RANKL <lb/>(TNFSF11), an archetypal progesterone-regulated gene (PRG), <lb/>increased over twofold in the luteal phase. <lb/>In addition to postulating that these differences in gene <lb/>expression in ER+ breast cancer might have the potential to be <lb/>used in an endogenous test of endocrine responsiveness we <lb/></body>

			<body>reasoned that hormone-dependent changes in gene expression <lb/>through the cycle could impact on the interpretation of commonly <lb/>measured biomarkers (e.g. PgR) and multigene prognostic <lb/>signatures (such as Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS), Prosigna <lb/>(PAM50), EndoPredict (EP) and Breast Cancer Index (BCI)). 11-14 <lb/>These signatures contain multiple ERGs and PAGs, whose <lb/>expression might vary in ER+ breast cancer according to when <lb/>during the menstrual cycle they are measured. <lb/>The earlier studies were retrospective in nature and limited to <lb/>cross-sectional comparisons between single samples from <lb/>patients in pre-defined windows of the menstrual cycle. As such, <lb/>while differences in tumoural gene expression through the cycle <lb/>were recorded, actual changes within patients could only be <lb/>implied and the variability between patients in any such changes <lb/>could not be assessed. Here we directly ask (i) whether the <lb/>differences noted previously are explained by consistent within <lb/>patient changes in gene expression through the phases of the <lb/>menstrual cycle and (ii) if these changes reflect the sensitivity of <lb/>the tumours to oestrogen-deprivation and therefore can predict <lb/>the antiproliferative response to ovarian ablation. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Patient demographics <lb/>Patient demographics are described separately for the two <lb/>independent prosepective studies in Supplementary Table 1. All <lb/>patients were ER+, 88% were PgR+ve and 9% HER2+ve; five of <lb/>the six HER2+ve cases were in the Vietnamese cohort. <lb/>Serum hormone levels <lb/>Serum hormone concentrations showed the expected patterns of <lb/>change during the menstrual cycle (Fig. 1a). Levels of oestradiol <lb/>were highest in W2 (median 845 pmol/L; 95% CI 413-991) with <lb/>little overlap of values in W1 (127 pmol/L; 95% CI 96-166); <lb/>concentrations in W3 (364 pmol/L; 95% CI 277-468) were <lb/>intermediate between those in W1 and W2 (Fig. 1b). There was <lb/>nearly complete separation of progesterone concentrations in W3 <lb/>(21.5 nmol/L; 95% CI 12.1-30.1) from the low values in W1 <lb/>(1.1 pmol/L; 95% CI 0.7-1.7) and W2 (1.7 pmol/L; 95% CI 0.8-2.3). <lb/>Sample availability <lb/>RNA was successfully extracted in paired tumour samples <lb/>(diagnosis and surgery) from 54 of the 70 patients recruited in <lb/>MenCER (Consort diagram, Supplementary Fig. 1). Nine of these <lb/>patients were excluded due to ambiguous menstrual cycle data. <lb/>Overall, 45 patients with good quality gene expression and <lb/>consistent menstrual cycle data were available. The median time <lb/>between the tumour samples was 27 days (interquartile range <lb/>20-34 days). <lb/>In the Vietnamese study, paired FFPE tumour samples at <lb/>diagnosis and two weeks later (prior to OvX) were available for 35 <lb/>of 56 patients (Consort diagram, Supplementary Fig. 1). Of these, <lb/>RNA was successfully extracted for 27 sample pairs, seven of which <lb/>were excluded due to ambiguous menstrual cycle data, yielding a <lb/>final set of 20 patients. The median time between the tumour <lb/>samples was 9 days (interquartile range 8-13 days). <lb/>Combining samples from the two studies gave a final group of <lb/>65 patients with the following window comparisons available: <lb/>15 same window comparisons (all MenCER); 14 comparisons of W1 <lb/>vs. W2 (7 MenCER, 7 Vietnamese); 20 comparisons of W2 vs. W3 <lb/>(14 M, 6 V); 10 comparisons of W1 vs. W3 (7 M, 3 V); 28 <lb/>comparisons of W1 vs. (W2 or W3) (14 M, 14 V); 32 comparisons <lb/>of (W1 or W2) vs. W3 (23 M, 9 V) (Supplementary Fig. 2, <lb/>Supplementary Data 1). <lb/>Unsupervised clustering of combined sample set <lb/>Unsupervised clustering of the gene expression data from this <lb/>combined sample set of 130 samples showed that 52 of the 65 <lb/>paired samples clustered together. There were four main clusters <lb/>apparent, labelled A-D in Fig. 2. Cluster A was enriched for <lb/>samples taken in W3 (24% W1, 24% W2, 52% W3) and showed the <lb/>lowest relative expression of PAGs, high expression of most ERGs <lb/>and high PRG expression. Cluster B comprised a more evenly <lb/>mixed group of tumours from the three windows (36% W1, 32% <lb/>W2, 32% W3) and segregated from cluster A based on relatively <lb/>higher PAG and lower PRG expression. Clusters C and D differed <lb/>from the other clusters on the basis of their lower expression of <lb/>ERGs and PRGs and contained 94% (15/16) of the PgR -ve samples. <lb/>Cluster D was enriched for tumour samples taken in W2 (25% W1, <lb/>45% W2, 30% W3) and showed the highest relative expression of <lb/>PAGs and the lowest of PRGs and PGR (30% IHC PgR −ve). Overall, <lb/>in this combined dataset, PGR expression and the AvProg were <lb/>both inversely correlated to the expression of PAGs (Spearman r = <lb/>−0.29, p = 0.0007 and r = −0.36, p = 0.0007, respectively) (Sup-<lb/>plementary Fig. 3). <lb/>Fig. 1 Serum hormone levels in 65 patients assessable in pre-specified window comparisons, a smoothed median (±1 day) concentrations, <lb/>error bars indicate interquartile range, b comparison of oestradiol and progesterone concentrations between windows <lb/></body>

			<body>Comparison of gene expression changes in samples from the <lb/>same window of the menstrual cycle <lb/>We first assessed if there were any significant changes in gene <lb/>expression between the 15 tumour samples taken in the same <lb/>window of the menstrual cycle (but one cycle apart). Five of our <lb/>45 selected genes (GEM, NFKB1A, PTGS2, STAT5A, ZFP36) <lb/>increased significantly (1.6-4.4-fold; FDR 0.04 to 0.0025; Supple-<lb/>mentary Data 2, Supplementary Fig. 4) between diagnosis and <lb/>surgery. It appears that the upregulation of these genes may be <lb/>related to longer time to fixation for the surgical samples rather <lb/>than study-related as four of these genes were also up regulated <lb/>in our studies of changes in gene expression in the absence of <lb/>drug-treatment. 15,16 These five genes were excluded from <lb/>further analysis, as any changes in their expression between <lb/>windows could not be ascribed with confidence to menstrual <lb/>cycle effects. <lb/>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: individual <lb/>window comparisons <lb/>For the individual window comparison between W1 and W3 and <lb/>between W1 and W2, the sample size was small (n = 10 and 14 <lb/>pairs respectively) and none of the changes in individual gene <lb/>expression reached significance after correction for multiple <lb/>testing (FDR &lt; 0.05; Supplementary Data 2). However, for the <lb/>comparison between W1 and W2 whilst no gene had an FDR &lt; <lb/>0.05, the four ERGs comprising the AvERG increased 1.9-2.7 fold in <lb/>W2 compared to W1 (uncorrected p-values 0.003 to 0.068, FDR <lb/>0.068 to 0.23). The expression of all seven PAGs also showed a <lb/>consistent trend to increase between W1 and W2 (FC 1.1-1.5; <lb/>uncorrected p-values 0.002 to 0.19, FDR 0.13 to 0.36; Supplemen-<lb/>tary Data 2). <lb/>Between W2 and W3 (n = 20 pairs), TFF1 and ATP6V1B1 both <lb/>decreased significantly (FC 0.47, BH = 0.008; FC 0.55, BH = 0.034, <lb/>respectively; Supplementary Data 2). Of note FKBP5, a putative <lb/>PRG, increased in 16 of the 20 tumours and this neared statistical <lb/>significance (FC 1.6, BH = 0.051). RANKL, which was expressed to a <lb/>very low extent, and other putative PRGs (RASSF5, EFHD1, TGFB3, <lb/>SGK3, SHROOM3, TNFSF10) did not consistently change between <lb/>W2 and W3. <lb/>The AvERG showed significant changes between the three <lb/>windows (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.0002); increasing between W1 and <lb/>W2 (FC 2.2, p = 0.011), and decreasing between W2 and W3 (FC <lb/>0.62, p = 0.006) and between W3 and W1 (FC 0.58, p = 0.01) (Fig. <lb/>3). Proliferation gene expression (AvProlif), also varied significantly <lb/>(Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.012), increasing between W1 and W2 (FC <lb/>1.41, p = 0.035) with non-significant decreases thereafter between <lb/>W2 and W3 (FC 0.95, p = 0.50) and W3 to W1 (FC 0.74, p = 0.084). <lb/>The AvProg showed a numerically higher level in W3 compared to <lb/>the other windows but this did not approach statistical <lb/>significance (FC 1.2-1.6, p = 0.19-0.23; Fig. 3). <lb/>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: Window 1 <lb/>vs. Window 2 or 3 <lb/>A pre-specified comparison of W1 vs. a combined W2 or W3 (n = <lb/>28) allowed for greater power for assessing the change from a low <lb/>to high/intermediate oestradiol exposure. The expression of 10 <lb/>individual genes (eight ERGs and two PAGs) changed significantly <lb/>between W1 and W2 or W3, with all genes showing higher levels <lb/>in W2-W3 (FC 1.4-2.4; FDR 0.016-0.05; Supplementary Table 2). <lb/>Fig. 2 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from the combined sample set of 130 samples (65 pairs) <lb/></body>

			<body>These genes included three of the four archetypal ERGs (GREB1, <lb/>PGR and TFF1) comprising the AvERG and five putative ERGs <lb/>(IGSF1, MSMB, SERPINA3, ATP6V1B1, CELSR2) whose expression was <lb/>previously shown to be down-regulated after OvX. 17 IGSF1 and <lb/>MSMB showed the greatest magnitude of change between the <lb/>windows (FC 2.4 and 2.3-fold respectively). In agreement with the <lb/>gene expression data, mean protein levels of PgR increased <lb/>between W1 and W2 or W3 (18.3% increase, p = 0.0015, FDR <lb/>0.024; Supplementary Fig. 5) but this did not lead to a change in <lb/>PgR positive/negative status for any tumour. Protein levels of ER <lb/>and Ki67 did not show a statistically significant change between <lb/>W1 and W2 or W3 (p = 0.056, BH 0.11 and p = 0.33, BH = 0.42 <lb/>respectively; Supplementary Fig. 5). <lb/>The AvERG (FC 1.9, p = 0.0005) and AvProlif (FC 1.3, p = 0.013) <lb/>increased significantly between W1 and W2-W3 (Fig. 4). The <lb/>AvProg response was more variable but there was a trend to <lb/>increase in W2-W3 (FC 1.4, p = 0.09). The changes in AvERG and <lb/>AvProlif showed a weak correlation but there was no obvious <lb/>relationship between AvProg and either AvERG or AvProlif <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 6). Individually the genes comprising the <lb/>AvERG increased approximately twofold in W2-W3 compared to <lb/>W1 (FC 1.7-2.2; BH 0.011-0.06) (Fig. 4). A similar pattern was <lb/>observed for PAGs with the exception of AURKA, although the <lb/>change was not as large (FC 1.3-1.5, BH 0.035-0.11) (Fig. 4). <lb/>Correlation of response to oestrogen deprivation with the change <lb/>in AvERG between W1 vs. W2-W3 <lb/>There was no correlation of the response to OvX in the <lb/>Vietnamese study, as measured by % change in Ki67 (r = −0.30, <lb/>p = 0.32) or AvProlif (r = −0.05, p = 0.89), with the change in <lb/>AvERG between W1 vs. W2-W3 in the small group of patients <lb/>in which this could be compared (n = 12-13) (Fig. 5). Anecdotally, <lb/>there was only one clear HER2-ve non-responder to OvX by <lb/>Ki67 and this showed the least increase in AvERG between W1 <lb/>vs. W2-W3. <lb/>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: Window 3 <lb/>vs. Window 1 or 2 <lb/>The effects of the higher level of progesterone in W3 (roughly <lb/>corresponding to the luteal phase) compared to the rest of the <lb/>cycle were examined by comparing gene expression changes <lb/>between W3 vs. a combined W1 or W2 (n = 32) (Supplementary <lb/>Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 7). For this comparison, FKBP5, a <lb/>putative PRG, was the most significant gene and showed the <lb/>greatest fold-change (FC 1.5, p = 0.0057, BH = 0.23), increasing in <lb/>24 of 32 tumours in W3. RANKL was the 5th most significant gene <lb/>and showed the second greatest increase (FC 1.4, p = 0.10, BH = <lb/>0.65).

			<body>significance. Overall, AvProg increased significantly in W3 (FC 1.5, <lb/>p = 0.026) but there were no significant changes in AvERG or <lb/>AvProlif. The change in AvProg showed a borderline significant <lb/>correlation with PGR expression (r = 0.34, p = 0.06), such that the <lb/>tumours with higher PGR expression showed a greater change in <lb/>AvProg. <lb/>Unpaired analysis of differences in gene expression through <lb/>menstrual cycle <lb/>To determine the consistency of these data with our earlier cross-<lb/>sectional analysis we performed an exploratory unpaired analysis <lb/>of all samples assessing the differences in gene expression <lb/>between the three pre-defined windows (103 samples; 29 in W1, <lb/>37 in W2, 37 in W3). The AvERG showed significant differences <lb/>between the three windows (KW p = 0.0014) with the highest <lb/>level in W2; W1 vs. W2 (FC 2.2; p = 0.0005), W2 vs. W3 (FC 0.63, <lb/>p = 0.015), W1 vs. W3 (FC 0.73, p = 0.14) (Fig. 6). The AvProlif <lb/>showed a trend to increase between W1 and W2 (FC 1.3, p = 0.07) <lb/>and there was a strong trend for the AvProg to be higher in W3; <lb/>W2 vs. W3 (FC 1.5, p = 0.056), W1 vs W3 (FC 0.66, p = 0.07). <lb/>Hierarchical clustering of the unpaired gene expression data <lb/>according to the window in which the sample was taken further <lb/>illustrates the differences in gene expression between windows <lb/>and also demonstrates the large variation that occurs within each <lb/>window (Supplementary Fig. 8). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>We have previously reported significant differences in the <lb/>expression of ERGs, PAGs and the PRG, RANKL, in ER+ tumours <lb/>in a retrospective study that related to the major changes in <lb/>hormone levels that occur during the menstrual cycle. 9,10 Here, we <lb/>have extended that observation in a prospective study to show <lb/>significant changes of gene expression of ERGs, PRGs and PAGs <lb/>within individual patients through the menstrual cycle and the <lb/>degree of variability in these changes between patients. <lb/>Previous work investigating changes in breast tumour biology <lb/>during the menstrual cycle is limited and the data are very <lb/>variable 18-25 which is most likely due to difficulties and differences <lb/>in assigning the phase of menstrual cycle. Here, both serum <lb/>hormone concentrations and menstural cycle data were used to <lb/>improve the definition of times through the mentrual cycle and to <lb/>assign patients to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle <lb/>windows. Approximately 20% of cases were excluded due to <lb/>inconsistent menstrual cycle data. Windows 1 and 2 had low and <lb/>high E2 levels, respectively (up to a sevenfold difference) and very <lb/>low progesterone levels; window 3, which largely represents the <lb/>luteal phase, had mean levels of E2 intermediate between those of <lb/>windows 1 and 2 and up to 20-fold higher levels of progesterone. <lb/>We combined tumour samples from patients in two indepen-<lb/>dent trials to increase the power of the study as individually the <lb/>separate studies would have been too small to reach meaningful <lb/>conclusions. Whilst the trials had some differences in their design <lb/>and patient demographics, unsupervised clustering of the gene <lb/>expression data generated did not reveal any clear study-related <lb/>effects. <lb/>Tumour samples taken in the same window of the menstrual <lb/>cycle provided a control group and indicated that the expression <lb/>of five of our selected genes increased between diagnosis and <lb/>surgery irrespective of cycle window. The upregulation of these <lb/>genes does not appear to be study-related as four of these genes <lb/>Fig. 4 Changes in AvERG, AvProlif and AvProg and in expression of their individual component ERGs, PAGs and PRGs between Window 1 vs. <lb/>Windows 2 or 3 (n = 28) <lb/></body>

			<body>were also upregulated in studies of changes in gene expression in <lb/>the absence of drug-treatment 15,16 where the upregulation was <lb/>ascribed to differences in the time taken to fixation for the <lb/>samples at the two time points. These five genes were thus <lb/>excluded from further analysis, as any changes in their expression <lb/>between different windows would not be attributable to <lb/>menstrual cycle effects. <lb/>Unsupervised clustering of the gene expression data from all <lb/>samples showed that most pairs clustered together indicating that <lb/>the changes in gene expression during the menstrual cycle were <lb/>not as great as the variation between patients in the majority of <lb/>cases. Nonetheless, the clustering revealed contrasting clusters <lb/>enriched for tumours taken in W2 and W3 indicating the timing of <lb/>the menstrual cycle had some effect on the clustering. The cluster <lb/>enriched for W2 tumours showed the highest relative expression <lb/>of PAGs and the lowest of PRGs while the cluster enriched for W3 <lb/>tumours showed the lowest relative expression of PAGs and high <lb/>PRG expression. This was reflected by an inverse correlation <lb/>between both PGR expression and signalling and proliferation <lb/>across all samples. These data are consistent with progesterone <lb/>receptor signalling modulating oestrogen-driven proliferation in <lb/>this premenopausal setting. The concept that PR activation in the <lb/>context of oestrogen-driven, ER+ breast cancer, can have an anti-<lb/>proliferative effect has been postulated by others 26,27 and it seems <lb/>that the oestrogenic status can directly affect whether progesto-<lb/>gens are pro-proliferative or antiproliferative. Thus, in the absence <lb/>of a functional oestrogen-activated ER complex, PgR activation <lb/>can stimulate proliferation 28-30 but when oestrogen and a <lb/>progestogen are combined, reductions in the oestrogen-induced <lb/>growth response have been reported both in vitro 28,31 and <lb/>ex vivo. 26 Mechanistically, it appears that in the presence of both <lb/>oestrogen and progesterone ligands, PR can affect ER target gene <lb/>activity by altering the interaction between ER and chromatin <lb/>thereby changing the transcriptional output of the ER <lb/>complex. 26,27 <lb/>The comparison of gene expression between W1 (low <lb/>oestradiol) with W2 (high oestradiol) was the most biologically <lb/>straightforward window comparison in terms of hormone levels <lb/>and this revealed a strong trend for an increase in ERG expression <lb/>between W1 and W2. Thus, the four ERGs comprising the AvERG (a <lb/>pre-defined composite measure of ERG expression) all increased <lb/>two to threefold in W2 compared to W1 but this did not reach <lb/>statistical significance most likely due to the small sample size <lb/>available. Comparison of W2 and W3 is less straightforward to <lb/>interpret as changes could be due to either the lower oestradiol <lb/>levels (approximately 50%), or the much higher progesterone <lb/>levels in W3 (&gt;10-fold) or both; the only two genes that changed <lb/>significantly were ERGs (TFF1, ATP6V1B1) which both decreased by <lb/>approximately 50% in W3. The AvERG, showed significant changes <lb/>between the three individual windows with a mean increase of <lb/>220% between W1 and W2 and approximate 40% decreases <lb/>thereafter between W2 and W3 and between W3 and W1. <lb/>To increase the power to detect changes in gene expression <lb/>from a low to high/intermediate oestradiol exposure we <lb/>performed a pre-specified comparison of W1 vs. a combined W2 <lb/>or W3. This showed that the expression of eight ERGs significantly <lb/>increased (mean of 1.9-fold) between W1 and W2 or W3 including <lb/>three of the four ERGs (GREB1, PGR and TFF1) comprising the <lb/>AvERG. Similar to our earlier retrospective study, 9,10 the fourth <lb/>gene comprising the AvERG, PDZK1, did not show a significant <lb/>change in expression although it showed a strong trend to do so. <lb/>This is in agreement with a recent study which showed a <lb/>correlation of GREB1, PGR and TFF1 but not PDZK1 gene expression <lb/>in ER +ve tumours with serum oestradiol levels in premenopausal <lb/>patients. 32 This latter study concurred with our earlier cross-<lb/>sectional study but lacked the longitudinal aspect of the current <lb/>study to allow consideration of within patient changes. Overall, <lb/>the AvERG showed a near twofold increase in expression between <lb/>W1 and W2 or W3. This compared to a difference of 1.5-fold <lb/>between the same windows in the retrospective study. 9,10 Of the <lb/>other putative ERGs that changed significantly between W1 and <lb/>W2 or W3, IGSF1, a member of the immunoglobulin-like domain-<lb/>containing superfamily and MSMB, an immunoglobulin binding <lb/>factor showed the greatest magnitude of change. Both of these <lb/>genes have been reported to have inhibin activity, 33,34 which may <lb/>be a factor in their increase in expression in W2-W3 vs. W1. <lb/>An unpaired analysis to assess differences rather than changes <lb/>in gene expression between the three pre-defined windows <lb/>demonstrated that the AvERG showed significant differences <lb/>between all windows, mirroring the paired changes reported <lb/>above, and these showed the same pattern to the previous cross-<lb/>sectional retrospective study. 9,10 <lb/>The expression of PAGs across the menstrual cycle mirrored the <lb/>changes observed in ERG expression but the magnitude of effect <lb/>was less. Thus, between W1 and W2, individual PAGs showed a <lb/>trend to increase between W1 and W2 such that the AvProlif, a <lb/>pre-defined composite measure of PAG expression, showed <lb/>significant changes between the three windows characterised <lb/>Fig. 5 Correlation of change in AvERG during menstrual cycle (Window 1 vs. Windows 2 or 3) with % change in Ki67 (a) and % change in <lb/>AvProlif (b) after OvX; • HER2+ ve tumours <lb/></body>

			<body>particularly by a mean increase of 40% between W1 and W2. <lb/>Comparison of W1 vs. W2 or W3 revealed significant increases in <lb/>the expression of two individual PAGs and a 30% increase of the <lb/>AvProlif in W2 or W3 compared to W1. These data are in slight <lb/>contrast to our earlier report of lower PAG expression in W3 with <lb/>no difference between W1 and W2. 9,10 However, the unpaired <lb/>analysis of the current data demonstrated a very similar pattern of <lb/>expression of AvProlif to the previous retrospective study with a <lb/>decline in proliferation at the end of W2 (days 13-16) such that <lb/>the AvProlif is near its nadir at the start of W3. <lb/>The RANK signalling pathway is known to be a key paracrine <lb/>mediator of progestogen action in breast epithelium and its <lb/>protein expression has been shown to correlate with serum <lb/>progesterone levels. 35,36 We previously reported twofold higher <lb/>levels of RANKL in W3, roughly corresponding to the luteal phase <lb/>of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone levels are at their <lb/>highest, compared to the other windows 10 and this has also been <lb/>observed by others. 37 Here, we measured RANKL and 10 other <lb/>putative PRGs to investigate if changes in their expression during <lb/>the menstrual cycle were apparent and used the AvProg as a <lb/>composite measure of PRG gene expression. Whilst the number of <lb/>samples available between W1 and W3 was too small to detect <lb/>any significant changes in individual gene expression, comparison <lb/>of W2 and W3 showed that FKBP5 increased in 80% of the tumours <lb/>in W3 and this was borderline significant. However, RANKL itself <lb/>did not show an increased level of expression in W3, possibly <lb/>because it was expressed to a very low extent in this group of <lb/>tumours. The AvProg did not show any significant changes <lb/>between the individual windows but showed a trend to increase <lb/>in W3 compared to the other windows. A comparison of W3 with a <lb/>combined W1 or W2 increased the power to compare the effects <lb/>of a high progesterone milieu in W3 with the much lower <lb/>progesterone levels in W1 or W2 and demonstrated that the <lb/>AvProg increased significantly in W3 as would be expected due to <lb/>the much higher level of progesterone in W3 compared to the rest <lb/>of the cycle. These changes in PRGs were more modest than those <lb/>in ERG and PAG expression across the cycle as a whole. <lb/>In order to investigate if the changes in gene expression in ER+ <lb/>breast cancer during the menstrual cycle we report here could <lb/>predict the antiproliferative response to ovarian ablation we <lb/>correlated the change in AvERG between W1 and W2 or W3 with <lb/>the response to OvX in samples from the Vietnamese study. 17 <lb/>Only a very weak correlation was observed. Although this analysis <lb/>had only low power due to the small number of samples available, <lb/>even with this small number it appears that this putative <lb/>endogenous test of hormonal sensitivity could not be sufficiently <lb/>reliable for clinical use. <lb/>The main weakness of the current work was the relatively low <lb/>proportion of patients available for comparisons of the individual <lb/>windows of the menstrual cycle, even after combining patient <lb/>samples from two independent studies. Combining windows <lb/>enabled greater power but in some cases (e.g. combining W2 and <lb/>W3) also added possible confounding factors such as widely <lb/>differing progesterone concentrations within the combined <lb/>window. Despite this, the impact of changes in endogenous <lb/>reproductive hormones on gene expression was demonstrated <lb/>very clearly. <lb/>The multigene prognostic signatures which are commonly used <lb/>in ER+ breast cancer such as RS, PAM50, EP and BCI, 11-14 contain <lb/>mulitple ERGs and PAGs and it is well established that the <lb/>expression of these genes are two of the main drivers of the <lb/>scores obtained from these tests. 38 Thus, the possibility that <lb/>the hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle could affect the <lb/>read out from these signatures merits study and we are <lb/>investigating this hypothesis in a follow-up study. <lb/>In conclusion, our data indicate that there are significant <lb/>changes in ERG, PRG and PAG expression in line with the <lb/>hormone changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. These <lb/>Fig. 6 Differences in AvERG, AvProlif and AvProg during the menstrual cycle (n = 103, unpaired); smoothed median (±1 day) values, error bars <lb/>indicate interquartile range, red lines show mean (±95% confidence interval) of each window <lb/></body>

			<body>changes need to be noted in any studies of the hormone-related <lb/>biology of breast cancer in premenopausal patients and may <lb/>affect the interpretation of data from some of the multigene <lb/>prognostic signatures which are commonly used in ER+ breast <lb/>cancer. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Patients and study designs <lb/>Patients were drawn from two prospective studies that assessed the <lb/>possible impact of the menstrual cycle on breast tumour biology in ER+ <lb/>breast cancer. The first of these was MenCER (The Menstrual cycle as a test <lb/>of endocrine responsiveness in premenopausal breast cancer), a UK-based <lb/>multicentre study. In addition, menstrual cycle effects were studied in <lb/>patients from a study of neoadjuvant oophorectomy (OvX) in Vietnam. The <lb/>endocrine and molecular effects of OvX in this Vietnamese study have <lb/>been recently published. 17 <lb/>For the MenCER study, premenopausal women aged &lt;50 years old with <lb/>histologically confirmed ER+ breast cancer who were proceeding to <lb/>surgery with no pre-surgical therapy, had a regular menstrual cycle and <lb/>had not received previous cancer therapy were eligible. Ethical approval <lb/>for the study was received from the local research ethics committee (South <lb/>West London REC 3). All participants provided written informed consent. <lb/>Paired blood and tumour samples were taken both at diagnosis and at <lb/>surgery with no treatment occurring between these time-points. Patient <lb/>reported date of last menstrual period and length of cycle were recorded. <lb/>The timing of surgery in relation to menstrual cycle was not controlled in <lb/>any way and it was expected that the menstrual phase at the time of <lb/>diagnosis and surgery for any given subject would be a chance event. We <lb/>also reasoned that the time between diagnosis and surgery would be <lb/>approximately two weeks and therefore in most patients would involve <lb/>different parts of their menstrual cycle. An accrual target of 70 patients was <lb/>selected on the basis of power calculations based on the magnitude of <lb/>changes (twofold) in ERGs we observed in our previous retrospective <lb/>studies. 9,10 With 70 paired comparisons between the groups it would be <lb/>possible to detect a standardised difference of 0.5 between the groups for <lb/>each of the biomarkers with 80% power, and a standardised difference of <lb/>0.6 with 90% power. <lb/>The Vietnamese study was a single arm study of neoadjuvant OvX in <lb/>patients with ER+ breast cancer, details of which have been described <lb/>previously. 17 In brief, the study recruited 56 premenopausal women with <lb/>ER+ breast cancer for whom modified radical mastectomy and surgical <lb/>bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was planned as part of their breast cancer <lb/>treatment. Patients had to report regular menstrual cycles and must not <lb/>have received any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for their cancer. <lb/>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the <lb/>National Cancer Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam from where all study participants <lb/>were recruited and by the Research Ethics Board of the University of <lb/>Toronto, Canada, from where the study was coordinated. The Committee <lb/>for Clinical Research at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London approved the <lb/>analysis of the samples collected in this trial. All participants provided <lb/>written informed consent. Breast tumour core biopsies (formalin fixed and <lb/>paraffin embedded) taken at diagnosis (A) and intra-operatively at the time <lb/>of OvX (B; 2 weeks later) were used in the current study. No treatment <lb/>occurred between these time-points. A single blood sample taken pre-OvX <lb/>(on day of OvX prior to anaesthesia or pre-operative medication; timepoint <lb/>B) was available for hormone measurements. Similar to the MenCER study, <lb/>the timing of surgery in relation to menstrual cycle was not controlled. <lb/>Exclusion criteria for both studies included: metastatic disease, use of <lb/>oral contraceptives or other hormonal contraceptives and concomitant use <lb/>of medications known to influence oestrogen levels. Informed consent was <lb/>obtained from all participants. <lb/>Serum hormone measurements <lb/>Serum concentrations of oestradiol (E2) were measured by radioimmu-<lb/>noassay following pre-assay purification using an organic extraction as <lb/>described previously. 39,40 Progesterone was measured using a solid phase <lb/>radioimmunoassay (Beckman Coulter IM1188). LH and FSH were measured <lb/>using immunoradiometric assays (IBL International MG12151 and Dia-<lb/>source KIP0841 respectively). The serum hormone measurements were <lb/>used in combination with menstrual cycle information to ascribe patients <lb/>to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle windows prior to considera-<lb/>tion of the biomarker data: window 1 (W1; low oestrogen and <lb/>progesterone milieu) days 27-35 or 1-6; window 2 (W2; high oestrogen <lb/>and low progesterone milieu) days 7-16; window 3 (W3; intermediate <lb/>oestrogen and high progesterone milieu) days 17-26 (Supplementary Fig. <lb/>2). In six patients one of the sample pairs fell on the cusp of two windows <lb/>(two between W1 and W2, four between W2 and W3; Supplementary Data <lb/>1); these samples were not used in the individual window comparisons but <lb/>were included when W1 and W2 or W2 and W3 were combined. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry <lb/>Hematoxylin and eosin sections were prepared for all FFPE tumour <lb/>samples and were reviewed to confirm diagnosis and assess tumour <lb/>content. Samples with tumour content &lt;40% were excluded from further <lb/>analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scoring for ER, PgR and Ki67 <lb/>were performed as reported previously. 41,42 ER and PgR were considered <lb/>positive if ≥1% cells stained positive. HER2 was measured immunohisto-<lb/>chemically using the HercepTest (DakoCytomation) and by fluorescent <lb/>in situ hybridization (Vysis Pathvysion, Downers Grove, IL) according to <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions. HER2 was considered positive if immunohis-<lb/>tochemical staining was scored 3+ or 2+ if the fluorescence in situ <lb/>hybridization analysis indicated an amplification ratio of &gt;2.0. 41 <lb/>Gene selection <lb/>Selection of genes for analysis in the biopsies was based on the set of <lb/>genes we measured previously in a retrospective cross-sectional study. 10 <lb/>This previous set of genes comprised ESR1, 26 ERGs and putative ERGs that <lb/>correlated with variations in plasma E2 concentrations, seven PAGs and a <lb/>single PRG, RANKL. ERGs whose expression did not differ in the <lb/>retrospective study were replaced with 16 other ERGs and putative ERGs <lb/>based on the observation that they were the most highly up or down-<lb/>regulated after OvX. 17 For the PAGs, we selected four of those measured <lb/>previously plus three other PAGs that were the most down-regulated after <lb/>OvX. In addition to RANKL, we selected 10 other putative PRGs for <lb/>measurement based on commonality in at least two literature reports 26,43-48 <lb/>and Mohammed 20 personal communication. In total, 45 genes of interest <lb/>(18 genes in common with the previous study 10 ) were selected for gene <lb/>expression measurement (Table 1). We used the AvERG (average ERGs; the <lb/>geomean of PGR, GREB1, TFF1 and PDZK1 8 ) as a composite measure of ERG <lb/>expression, the AvProlif (average PAGs; geomean of AURKA, CDC20, MKI67, <lb/>TOP2A, UBE2C) as a composite measure of PAGs and the AvProg (average <lb/>PRGs; geomean of FKBP5 and RANKL) as a composite measure of PRG <lb/>expression. We also measured five housekeeping genes (ACTB, MRPL19, <lb/>PSMC4, SF3A1, TBP). <lb/>Measurement of gene expression <lb/>Total RNA was extracted from two 10 μm sections of formalin-fixed <lb/>paraffin-embedded breast tumour samples using the RecoverAll (Ambion) <lb/>kit according to the manufacturer&apos;s procedure. The NanoString nCounter <lb/>gene expression system (GEN2) (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) <lb/>was used to measure gene expression without target amplification. 49 In <lb/>brief, an nCounter CodeSet (NanoString Technologies) containing gene-<lb/>specific probe-pairs for the 50 genes selected above (including the five <lb/>housekeeping genes) as well as six exogenous positive control RNA <lb/>targets, and eight exogenous negative control sequences, was hybridised <lb/>to 200 ng total RNA in a single 30 μl hybridization reaction. After overnight <lb/>hybridization (15-21 h) at 65°C, the samples were processed using the <lb/>NanoString nCounter Prep Station and Digital Analyzer according to the <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Assay validity was confirmed by assessing the <lb/>linearity of six internal positive RNA controls and the non-specific <lb/>background from signal in eight internal negative controls included in <lb/>each reaction. The raw nCounter counts for each gene of interest were <lb/>corrected for background by subtracting the geometric mean of the <lb/>negative controls, normalised to the geometric mean of the five <lb/>housekeeping genes to allow for variation in the amount and quality of <lb/>input RNA and log2 transformed (Supplementary Data 1; raw gene <lb/>expression data; Supplementary Data 3; normalised log-transformed data). <lb/>The housekeeping genes did not show any significant changes in <lb/>expression between individual windows or between the combinations of <lb/>windows (Supplementary Table 4). <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>For paired data, we performed pre-specified analyses of changes in the <lb/>gene expression levels between individual windows (W1 vs. W2, W2 vs. W3, <lb/></body>
