			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme strains on <lb/>health systems, public health infrastructure, and economies <lb/>of many countries. It has significantly impacted the German <lb/>healthcare system on several levels. On March 16, 2020, the <lb/>German Government announced first lockdown restrictions <lb/>(1). For the healthcare system deferral of elective procedures <lb/>was recommended to preserve hospital resources, especially <lb/>intensive care beds, for COVID-19 patients (2). This lockdown <lb/>disrupted routine hospital services for all non-COVID patients, <lb/>for whom required treatments for non-urgent conditions were <lb/>canceled or significantly postponed. The consequences for <lb/>the quality of life and clinical outcomes of non-COVID-19 <lb/>patients affected worldwide by COVID-19 lockdown regulations <lb/>are not known. Moreover, a deterioration of the economic <lb/>situation of the hospitals is to be expected as the DRG-based <lb/>(diagnosis related groups) revenues will considerably decrease. <lb/>As a result, the German Hospital Association (&quot;Deutsche <lb/>Krankenhausgesellschaft&quot;) has already demanded to define a <lb/>lump-sum budget for all German hospitals for the months <lb/>April to December 2020 (3). It was estimated that more than <lb/>28 Mio. Surgical procedures have been canceled or postponed <lb/>worldwide because of COVID-19 (4). In an early German <lb/>correspondence, Kuhlen et al. (5) reported a 42.7% decrease in <lb/>inpatient admissions during a 5-week period starting in mid <lb/>March 2020 based on an analysis of 310 German hospitals that <lb/>are part of the so-called &quot;Initiative Qualitätsmedizin&quot; (IQM). <lb/>The highest decrease observed in their report was for knee <lb/>endoprosthesis with 83.5% (5). <lb/>Importantly, surveys suggest that even patients with life-<lb/>threatening conditions may have avoided hospital admission, <lb/>possibly due to fear of SARS-CoV2 exposure. Thus, anecdotal <lb/>observations (6) and reports especially focusing on cardiac <lb/>and neurological procedures already note decreased patient <lb/>numbers, for example, in the U.S. and Austria: Kansagara et <lb/>al. describe a 39% decrease in the use of stroke imaging based <lb/>on an analysis of the respective numbers in a commercial <lb/>neuroimaging database across 856 hospitals in the U.S. (7), <lb/>whereas Metzler et al. have conducted a nationwide retrospective <lb/>survey and reported a similar major decline (39.4%) in hospital <lb/>admissions/treatment during March 2020 for all subtypes of <lb/>acute coronary syndrome with the beginning of the COVID-19 <lb/>outbreak in Austria (8). In summary, the potential tangible effects <lb/>of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical care for conditions <lb/>other than COVID-19 have been difficult to quantify and, <lb/>consequently, more comprehensive analyses are required (9). <lb/>Thus, one of our research questions was to investigate if the <lb/>reductions in inpatient hospital admissions for critical care <lb/>conditions as reported in the international literature could be <lb/>confirmed in our cohort. <lb/>Within the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII), <lb/>all German university hospitals started to establish data <lb/>integration centers (DIC) in 2018 and 2019 for the purpose <lb/>of managing, computing, and sharing data extracted from <lb/>electronic health records (EHRs) (10). The participating hospitals <lb/>are organized in four consortia (DIFUTURE, HiGHmed, <lb/>MIRACUM and SMITH), all working on different approaches for <lb/>data sharing (11-14). <lb/>The fundamental concept for all consortia and for cross-<lb/>consortial cooperation, however, is a federated approach, that <lb/>is, the data remain locally within each university hospitals&apos; <lb/>data repository and the analysis algorithms are distributed to <lb/>the sites for joint analysis projects. At an early stage, this <lb/>approach was already used to analyze regional differences in <lb/>thrombectomy rates in stroke patients across the 10 MIRACUM <lb/>university hospitals (15). In 2018/2019, the capabilities for data <lb/>sharing across the sites of all MII consortia were illustrated <lb/>by a demonstrator study, which focused on the analysis of <lb/>comorbidity and rare diseases (16). <lb/></body>

			<body>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the four consortia <lb/>have rapidly assembled their joint expertise in data sharing <lb/>infrastructures and established a concept for the National <lb/>University Medicine (NUM) COVID-19 data and technology <lb/>platform. The concept comprises a comprehensive set of <lb/>decentralized as well as central components and will be published <lb/>in the future. Here, we present first results of a preparatory <lb/>groundwork, which was initiated by the MIRACUM consortium <lb/>around its data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) <lb/>architecture based on a FHIR R gateway and the Informatics for <lb/>Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) data repositories (17-<lb/>19). From May to July 2020, the infrastructure was made available <lb/>to all German university hospitals. Twenty of them implemented <lb/>it in their DIC, but only eighteen of those obtained Institutional <lb/>Review Board (IRB) as well as data Use and Access Committee <lb/>(UAC) approval for joint analysis in this initial project before end <lb/>of July 2020. <lb/>The objective of this study is to describe the change of care <lb/>in the German COVID-19 lockdown phase by comparing the <lb/>counts of inpatient hospital admissions and admissions related <lb/>to specific clinical situations during the first 9 weeks (i.e., March <lb/>16 to May 17, 2020) of the German COVID-19 lockdown phase <lb/>with the counts of corresponding timeframes in 2018 and 2019. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>This comparative retrospective study relates the number of <lb/>events (as indicated below) during the lockdown period to the <lb/>number of events in corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019 <lb/>based on the analysis of a claims dataset across 18 German <lb/>university hospitals. We have built on infrastructures and <lb/>regulatory frameworks established at the participating university <lb/>hospitals in the first 2 years of MII funding (2018/2019). All <lb/>sites involved were in the process of setting up local DIC, <lb/>extracting data from a variety of local data sources, harmonizing <lb/>such data and preparing them locally for applying joint <lb/>observational research analyses. Even though the four consortia <lb/>have originally designed different architectural approaches for <lb/>their respective DIC and for sharing data across their consortium <lb/>sites, the national MII steering committee has initiated several <lb/>working groups with the goal of encouraging and maintaining <lb/>inter-consortial interoperability, consent, data sharing and <lb/>communication. During the past years, these working groups <lb/>developed, for example, a template form for acquiring a broad <lb/>patient consent for reusing clinical data for research, common <lb/>process definitions, regulations and governance structures for <lb/>data sharing, as well as a joint core dataset specification, based on <lb/>the international FHIR R standard. Most of the sites had already <lb/>established data UACs, while some used this project to initiate <lb/>their implementation. <lb/>Inclusion Criteria <lb/>All patients fulfilling the following criteria were included in <lb/>the study: <lb/>• Inpatient hospital admission between January 1 and May 31 of <lb/>the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. <lb/>• All cases had to be complete, that is, a discharge date had to be <lb/>present at the time of data retrieval. <lb/>Cases with a missing discharge date were excluded from the <lb/>subsequent analysis. <lb/>Outcomes <lb/>Main outcomes of the study are the number of inpatient hospital <lb/>admissions and the number of admissions in derived groups as <lb/>described below for the lockdown period and the corresponding <lb/>periods in 2018 and 2019 at a temporal granularity of one <lb/>calendar week (&quot;cw&quot;). Changes between periods are represented <lb/>as absolute and relative differences. <lb/>Appropriate cases were grouped by ICD chapters (according <lb/>to ICD-10-GM chapters) and reasons for treatment, defined by <lb/>combining diagnosis codes and procedure codes [as described by <lb/>Günster et al. (20)]. <lb/>The following data elements were queried from each <lb/>participating site&apos;s research data repository for eligible <lb/>inpatient encounters: <lb/>• Principal diagnosis (primary codes based on the tenth revision <lb/>of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and <lb/>Related Health Problems, German Modification, ICD-10-<lb/>GM; www.dimdi.de). <lb/>• Related procedures [available as &quot;Operationen-und <lb/>Prozedurenschlüssel&quot; (OPS)] <lb/>• Begin of inpatient stay (granularity of calendar days) <lb/>• End of inpatient stay (granularity of calendar days) <lb/>• Pseudonymized patient identifier (ID) <lb/>• Pseudonymized encounter ID. <lb/>Data Acquisition and Data Governance <lb/>A dockerized (21) infrastructure environment, consisting of <lb/>prepackaged ETL-processes (including data transformation and <lb/>data pseudonymization), a FHIR-based gateway and an i2b2 <lb/>research database (17, 18), was provided by the DIC team of the <lb/>University Hospital Erlangen (UHE) to the participating sites of <lb/>the German MII (Table 1). This infrastructure supported a quick <lb/>start to load data items of the basic modules from the MII core <lb/>dataset (i.e., demographics, encounter information, diagnosis, <lb/>procedures, laboratory analysis and medication) into a common <lb/>data model (defined by the i2b2 ontology). For this first analysis, <lb/>specific ETL processes were developed to accept the German <lb/>reimbursement claims dataset for inpatient care as input format <lb/>[data formatted according to the data dictionary provided by the <lb/>&quot;InEK-Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus&quot; (22)]. <lb/>The present query was developed and validated at UHE, and <lb/>then distributed to the participating sites as a dockerized shiny <lb/>(23) web application, implemented in R (24), that integrated with <lb/>the abovementioned infrastructure environment. By agreeing <lb/>on a common data model, the environment distributed to all <lb/>participating sites provided the means to perform the same SQL <lb/>statements and analysis scripts across all partnering hospitals <lb/>and to deliver standardized aggregated data back to the UHE <lb/>DIC team. This analysis approach was based on concepts that <lb/>have already been applied for earlier distributed analyses pursued <lb/>within the federated MIRACUM DIC infrastructure (15, 25). <lb/></body>

The dockerized query was then <lb/>executed against the local i2b2 database, loading the data via SQL <lb/>into an R session to further transform and aggregate the data <lb/>and provide the results via the local web user interface. Finally, <lb/>after local review and approval according to the local site&apos;s data <lb/>governance guidelines, these aggregated results were uploaded to <lb/>a secure platform at the UHE DIC by each participating site. <lb/>This retrospective federated analysis was reviewed and <lb/>approved by the ethics committee of the Erlangen-Nürnberg <lb/>University (259_20 Bc). An informed consent was waived <lb/>due to the retrospective design of this analysis and the <lb/>use of de-identified data. All participating sites subsequently <lb/>obtained approval for the proposed analysis by their local ethics <lb/>committees as well as UACs. <lb/>Data Transformation and Statistical <lb/>Analysis <lb/>The aggregated data of all sites was collected and consolidated at <lb/>UHE, where all subsequent statistical analyses were conducted <lb/>with R version 4.0.0 (24). The data was only analyzed in <lb/>a descriptive manner and is based on summary statistics. <lb/>Comparisons of absolute counts between time periods <lb/>of different years are reported as relative differences (in <lb/>percentages). Graphics were created in R with ggplot2 (26) and <lb/>ggpubr (27). We here report the admission numbers of several <lb/>clinical situations in comparison of 2018 and 2020. As a reference <lb/>for the variability in admissions numbers between non-COVID <lb/>years, we further present the differences between 2018 and 2019. <lb/>In Germany, first lockdown restrictions were announced on <lb/>March 16, 2020 in cw 12 (1). In this publication, we refer to this <lb/>point in time as the &quot;lockdown-announcement.&quot; <lb/>In non-COVID-19 years, a decrease in inpatient hospital <lb/>admissions can be observed in connection with holiday periods. <lb/>As the timing of Easter holidays fluctuates between March and <lb/>April, the corresponding cw of 2018 and 2019 were relatively <lb/>adjusted to align with Easter holidays of 2020, analogous as <lb/>described by Günster et al. (20), for a more exact comparison of <lb/>the weeks post lockdown-announcement with the previous years <lb/>(&quot;adjusted weeks&quot;). More precisely, the cw ending with Easter <lb/>Sunday were aligned for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, that is, <lb/>cw 15 in 2020 corresponds to cw 13 in 2018 and cw 16 in 2019. <lb/>Due to the focus of this analysis and for the sake of simplicity, <lb/>we assume the week of the lockdown-announcement (cw 12) <lb/>being the adjusted week 0, with previous weeks numbered with <lb/>negative (adjusted week −1, −2 etc.) and subsequent weeks with <lb/>positive numbers (adjusted week 1, 2 etc.) relative to adjusted <lb/>week 0. <lb/>In order to investigate the implications of the lockdown <lb/>regulations, two periods of time were examined more in detail <lb/>with a first 4-week phase in which stricter restrictions applied and <lb/>a second 4-week phase in which these restrictions were partially <lb/>relaxed again: <lb/>• Weeks 1 to 4 after lockdown-announcement, which are <lb/>referred to as &quot;adjusted weeks 0 to 3&quot; (i.e., cw 10-13 in 2018, <lb/>cw 13-16 in 2019, and cw 12-15 in 2020). <lb/>• Weeks 5 to 8 after lockdown-announcement, which are <lb/>referred to as &quot;adjusted weeks 4 to 7&quot; (i.e., cw 14-17 in 2018, <lb/>cw 17-20 in 2019, and cw 16-19 in 2020). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>The results presented below were derived from 18 German <lb/>university hospitals (with a total of about one Mio. inpatient <lb/>hospital admissions per year), with four hospitals from <lb/>the DIFUTURE, two from the HiGHmed, eight from the <lb/>MIRACUM, and four from the SMITH consortium. Inpatient <lb/>hospital admissions of the year 2018 of the 18 participating <lb/>university hospitals are summarized in Table 1. <lb/>Within our dataset, an admission reduction from 2018 to 2020 <lb/>is present for adjusted weeks 0 to 3 with a median decrease <lb/>of 1,524 admissions (IQR: 743.5, Table 2), which represents <lb/>a relative change of −15.4 to −43.9% per hospital (data not <lb/>shown). Within the 5 months (January to May), the number of <lb/>inpatient hospital admissions across all participating sites only <lb/>differed slightly in 2018 and 2019 (i.e., 449,154 vs. 443,685, which <lb/>represents a decrease of 1.2%), whereas the number of inpatient <lb/>admissions in 2020 were reduced to 383,734, which represents a <lb/>decrease of 14.6% compared to 2018 (Table 3). <lb/>In adjusted weeks 0 to 3, overall inpatient hospital admissions <lb/>were 52,356 in 2020 compared to 80,606 in 2018, which <lb/>corresponds to a decrease of 35%, whereas from 2018 to 2019, <lb/>an increase of 2.8% (80,606 to 82,874) could be observed.

This decline is followed by <lb/>a steep decline in the adjusted week 0, directly after the <lb/>lockdown-announcement in Germany. In adjusted weeks 1 to <lb/>3 the admission numbers remain at a low level, whereas an <lb/>increase can be observed in the subsequent 4 weeks (adjusted <lb/>weeks 4 to 7). <lb/>Table 4 presents the number of inpatient hospital admissions <lb/>grouped by the ICD-10 disease chapters I to IX in more detail: <lb/>for three different time periods (the complete period of January <lb/>1, to May 31, the adjusted weeks 0 to 3 and the subsequent <lb/>adjusted weeks 4 to 7) relative changes in admission rates of <lb/>2019 and 2020 are compared with the corresponding periods of <lb/>2018. Notably, all comparisons between 2018 and 2020 revealed <lb/>a reduction of inpatient hospital admissions. In contrast, within <lb/>the 5 months period from 2018 to 2019, the values in our <lb/>cohort varied between an increase of 4.4% (ICD chapter I) and <lb/>a decrease of −6.5% (ICD chapter III). Within the 4 weeks after <lb/>the lockdown-announcement (adjusted weeks 0 to 3), the highest <lb/>decrease of inpatient admissions in 2020 was associated with <lb/>ICD chapters VIII &quot;Diseases of the ear and mastoid process&quot; <lb/>(61.9%), followed by chapter XII &quot;Diseases of the skin and <lb/>subcutaneous tissue&quot; (57.50%) and chapter XIII &quot;Diseases of the <lb/>musculoskeletal system&quot; (56.7%) in comparison with the adjusted <lb/>period of 2018. In contrast, the largest decrease from 2018 to <lb/>2019 could be observed with 23.2% in ICD chapter X &quot;Diseases <lb/>of the respiratory system.&quot; The lowest reduction in admissions in <lb/>2020 were related to pregnancies/childbirths (chapter XV: 16.1%) <lb/>and conditions originating in the perinatal period (chapter XVI: <lb/>8.1%) as well as neoplasms (chapter II: 12.9%). <lb/>In order to analyze the adaption of routine care processes <lb/>to the restricted resources associated with COVID-19 lockdown <lb/>and legislative regulations, we compared a set of clinical <lb/>situations where the deferral of elective procedures would be <lb/>seen as uncritical or at least less critical (i.e., arthrosis related <lb/>endoprosthesis surgery, surgeries of benign tumors) to situations <lb/>with more critical events such as endoprosthesis surgery after <lb/>hip fracture, surgeries due to malignant tumors, myocardial <lb/>infarction or stroke.

The curves are aligned for Easter holidays as outlined <lb/>above. Vertical lines (gray) mark adjusted weeks 0, 3, 4 and 7, respectively. <lb/>delay during a COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, we analyzed <lb/>critical events for which high reductions in inpatient hospital <lb/>admissions were reported in the international literature [e.g., <lb/>Hoyer et al.: 38 and 46% reduction of stroke admissions at 2 of <lb/>4 sites of a multi-center study in Germany (28); Rodríguez-Leor <lb/>et al.: 40% reduction of STEMI-setting related procedures across <lb/>73 sites in Spain (29)]. <lb/>Figure 2 illustrates inpatient hospital admissions related to <lb/>myocardial infarction and stroke. Within adjusted weeks 0 to <lb/>3, admissions related to myocardial infarction were reduced by <lb/>38.7% (736 to 451) from 2018 to 2020 and admissions related <lb/>to stroke by 19.6% (1,260 to 1,013). In contrast, the respective <lb/>reductions between 2018 and 2019 were 5.2% (736 vs. 698) and <lb/>5% (1,260 vs. 1,197), respectively. <lb/>Figure 3 illustrates inpatient hospital admissions related to <lb/>endoprosthesis implants due to arthrosis and due to hip fracture, <lb/>an example comparing a less critical with an emergency clinical <lb/>situation. Within adjusted weeks 0 to 3, admissions related to <lb/>endoprosthesis implants due to arthrosis were reduced by 82.4% <lb/>(153 to 27) from 2018 to 2020, while admissions related to <lb/>endoprosthesis implants due to hip fracture increased by 0.5% <lb/>(189 to 190). In contrast, from 2018 to 2019 a reduction of 0.7% <lb/>(153 vs. 152) could be observed for endoprosthesis implants due <lb/>to arthrosis, whereas an increase of 1.1% (189 vs. 191) could be <lb/>observed for admissions related to endoprosthesis implants due <lb/>to hip fracture. <lb/>Figure 4 illustrates inpatient hospital admissions related to <lb/>lung cancer and (malignant) brain tumor surgeries, with the <lb/>2020 curve being similar to the curves of 2018 and 2019. Within <lb/>adjusted weeks 0 to 3, admissions related to lung cancer surgeries <lb/>were reduced by 8.8% (102 to 93) from 2018 to 2020 and <lb/>admissions related to (malignant) brain tumor surgeries by 14.7% <lb/>(136 to 116). In contrast, from 2018 to 2019 an increase of 10.8% <lb/>(102 vs. 113) could be observed for lung cancer surgeries whereas <lb/>a decrease of 8.1% (136 vs. 125) could be observed for (malignant) <lb/>brain tumor related surgeries. <lb/>Figure 5 illustrates inpatient hospital admissions related to <lb/>hysterectomies due to benign tumors and due to malignant <lb/>tumors, a further example comparing a less critical with a <lb/>more critical clinical situation. Within adjusted weeks 0 to 3, <lb/>admissions related to hysterectomies due to benign tumors were <lb/>reduced by 78.8% (104 to 22) from 2018 to 2020 and increased by <lb/>15.8% (38 to 44) for hysterectomies due to malignant tumors. In <lb/>contrast, from 2018 to 2019 increases of 6.7% (104 vs. 111) and <lb/>13.2% (38 vs. 43) were observed for these clinical situations. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In this descriptive retrospective analysis, a decrease in overall <lb/>inpatient hospital admissions of 35% was observed across 18 <lb/>university hospitals in Germany in 2020 during the 4 weeks <lb/>directly after the announcement of the lockdown due to COVID-<lb/>19 compared to the adjusted period of 2018. In contrast to this, <lb/>a slight increase of 2.8% could be observed from 2018 to 2019. <lb/>The decrease from 2018 to 2020 is similar to the decrease of <lb/>39% reported by Günster et al. (20), who analyzed a cohort of <lb/>members of the statutory sickness fund &quot;AOK&quot; and were treated <lb/>in German hospitals between March 16 and April 5, 2020. Kuhlen <lb/>et al., however, reported an even larger decrease of 42.7% in <lb/>inpatient hospital admission between March 3 and April 19, 2020 <lb/>in comparison with 2019 (5). <lb/>Thus, overall inpatient hospital admissions in our <lb/>investigation showed a slightly lower decrease than those <lb/>reported by Kuhlen et al. (5) and Günster et al. (20), which <lb/>may have several reasons: First, total numbers of cases analyzed <lb/>differ among the three studies. While our study cohort consisted <lb/>of 52,356 inpatient hospital admissions in the 4 weeks after <lb/>the lockdown-announcement, Günster et al. and Kuhlen et al. <lb/>analyzed 240,774 cases and 294,622 cases, respectively. Second, <lb/>the three studies analyzed slightly different time periods in 2020, <lb/>which are, however, overlapping by the 3 weeks from March 16 <lb/>to March April 5, 2020 (adjusted weeks 0 to 2). Furthermore, we <lb/>have analyzed data exclusively from university hospitals. This <lb/>explain, why inpatient hospital admissions were slightly <lb/>less reduced in our analysis. Lastly, it should be noted that, <lb/>analogous to Günster et al. (20), we compared the numbers of <lb/>2020 with holiday adjusted weeks of 2018 and 2019 to control <lb/>for the decline in inpatient hospital admissions associated <lb/>with the Easter holidays in Germany, which was observed in <lb/>our cohort. <lb/>Our results regarding inpatient hospital admissions due to <lb/>myocardial infarctions (−38.7% from 2018 to 2020) are in <lb/>accordance with those reported by Günster et al. (20) who found <lb/>a 31% reduction within the &quot;AOK&quot; dataset in comparison with <lb/></body>

			<body>compared to the average of 2017 to 2019 reported from Ulm <lb/>University Hospital (33). <lb/>While other researchers observed a reduction of up to 46% in <lb/>admission rates for stroke patients (28), our analysis across the <lb/>18 German university hospitals shows a reduction of 19.6% from <lb/>2018 to 2020. This lesser reduction might be due to our analysis <lb/>of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke which are associated <lb/>with neurological deficits and imaging findings of ischemia or <lb/>hemorrhage, since we did not include patients with transient <lb/>ischemic attack (TIA). Patients with TIA, who experience minor <lb/>and transient neurological deficits, might have in particular <lb/>deferred hospital admission during the COVID-19 lockdown. <lb/>Our findings, however, are in accordance with those reported <lb/>by Günster et al. who reported a reduction of 19% in stroke <lb/>admissions compared to 2019 (20). <lb/>The careful prioritization of critically ill patients by the 18 <lb/>German hospitals is illustrated by the differences in hospital <lb/>admissions for endoprosthesis implants due to arthrosis and due <lb/>to hip fracture. In the 4 weeks after the lockdown-announcement <lb/>in Germany, admissions due to hip fractures were similar <lb/>compared to the adjusted period in 2018 [&lt;-1 % vs. 2020, <lb/>−2 % reported by Günster et al. (20)] whereas admissions for <lb/>endoprosthesis implants due to arthrosis were reduced by 82.4% <lb/>[79% decrease reported by Günster et al. in comparison with 2019 <lb/>(20)]. The high similarity of our results to those of Günster et al. <lb/>(20) confirms their earlier results and illustrates that urgent care <lb/>for hip fractures apparently was not reduced within the COVID-<lb/>lockdown phase, in Germany, in contrast to other European <lb/>countries (34, 35). <lb/>Even though the observed trend in our results concerning <lb/>cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic are in alignment <lb/>with reports from the US, our decreases are less pronounced. <lb/>London et al. reported clear trends suggesting a significant <lb/>decline of care in the cancer cohorts explored in their recent <lb/>analysis of 20 US healthcare institutions based on the TriNetX <lb/>COVID and Cancer Research Network (between 39.1% reduction <lb/>for lung cancer and 51.8% reduction for melanoma) (36). <lb/>When analyzing the inpatient hospital admissions grouped by <lb/>ICD chapters, we observed an overall reduction of only 12.9% <lb/>in neoplasm-related admissions (ICD chapter II) during the <lb/>first 4 weeks after lockdown-announcement compared to 2018. <lb/>Our analyses regarding other cancer related inpatient hospital <lb/>admissions show similar results with a decrease of 8.8% for lung <lb/>cancer related surgeries and 14.7% for (malignant) brain tumor <lb/>related surgeries in 2020 compared to 2018. Günster et al. report <lb/>a reduction of 20% for admissions due to lung cancer related <lb/>surgeries from 2019 to 2020, whereas the reduction in hospital <lb/>admissions for (malignant) brain tumor related surgeries was <lb/>only 2% (20). However, it has to be noted that the decrease from <lb/>2018 to 2020 in our study is based on a difference of only 9 <lb/>admissions for lung cancer and 20 admissions for (malignant) <lb/>brain tumors. <lb/>A further stringent example for the careful prioritization <lb/>of critically ill patients by the 18 German hospitals are the <lb/>inpatient hospital admissions related to hysterectomies due to <lb/>benign tumors compared to the ones due to malignant tumors: <lb/>hysterectomies due to benign tumors were strongly reduced by <lb/>78.8% but even moderately increased in 2020 by 15.8% if due to <lb/>malignant tumors compared to 2018. Günster et al. reported a <lb/>reduction of 66% for hysterectomies due to benign tumors and <lb/>an increase of 23% for malignant tumors from 2019 to 2020 <lb/>(20). While the trend of our results regarding hysterectomies <lb/>is in alignment with the numbers observed by Günster et al., <lb/>it has to be noted, that the reduction observed from 2018 to <lb/>2020 in our study is based on a difference of only six cases for <lb/>malignant tumors. However, our analysis of admissions related <lb/>to hysterectomies underlines that the university hospitals in <lb/>our cohort adapted their care practices to the urgency of the <lb/>clinical situation. <lb/>This study has a number of limitations: First, it is a <lb/>retrospective analysis based on observational data collected in <lb/>EHR. Second, the overall sample size for many of the here <lb/>investigated clinical situations is small with a large variability <lb/>between the 18 participating hospitals. Because of the large <lb/>heterogeneity between German hospitals, for example, in number <lb/>of beds, number of admissions and case mixes (also within those <lb/>included in our study, compare Table 1) our data cannot be seen <lb/>as a full representative picture for all German university hospitals. <lb/>Therefore, we present only descriptive results and have resigned <lb/>from statistical hypothesis testing. Furthermore, other co-variates <lb/>and possible confounding variables have not been controlled, <lb/>for example, the development of the demographic situation <lb/>in Germany, the catchment area of the respective hospitals, <lb/>different age and gender distributions, or different availability <lb/>and distribution of specialist departments at the participating <lb/>hospitals. One of the most important limitations is that data <lb/>was drawn from sets of claims data having a standardized <lb/>format used for quality assurance and for the calculation of <lb/>the new versions of the German DRG system each year (see <lb/> §21 KHEntgG, hospital renumeration law). The procedure and <lb/>quality assurance measures for providing this dataset until the <lb/>yearly deadline (March 31) are highly standardized. However, <lb/>even though datasets with this data structure are regulated by law, <lb/>the data set may differ slightly among hospitals, if it is generated <lb/>during the year (e.g., some hospitals might exclude cases which <lb/>have no discharge event yet from the observed period, others <lb/>might include them). In order to ensure a standardized approach <lb/>across all participating sites, we strictly adhered to the legal <lb/>requirements to format the dataset and thus, for example, <lb/>excluded cases without a discharge date from the analyses. <lb/>Despite its limitations, the existing data set provides the best <lb/>information currently available at German university hospitals <lb/>for this study. <lb/>Those limitations constrain the conclusions we can currently <lb/>draw. However, future studies could add more detail to our <lb/>findings presented here. Furthermore, we believe that the <lb/>sources of our data and the technologies, procedures and <lb/>regulatory framework we have established for sharing them <lb/>are sound, reproducible and scalable. The latter is the most <lb/>important aspect for our project to implement the National <lb/>University Medicine (NUM) COVID-19 data and technology <lb/>platform which will now be extended to include all German <lb/>university hospitals and to cover a broad range of clinical data <lb/>based on the basic modules of the MII core dataset and its <lb/></body>

			<body>extension with the GECCO dataset [GECCO = German Corona <lb/>Consensus (37)]. <lb/>Although we observed large heterogeneity across the 18 <lb/>participating sites, indicated by the large inter-quartile ranges <lb/>(IQR) in Table 3, an admission reduction from 2018 to 2020 is <lb/>present across all 18 participating university hospitals during the <lb/>4 weeks following the announcement of the lockdown (Table 2). <lb/>When using such observational data for statistical modeling in <lb/>the future, the heterogeneity between sites needs to be taken <lb/>into account, which is particularly relevant for future analysis <lb/>based on the NUM data and technology platform. Although we <lb/>expect that some part of the heterogeneity could be explained <lb/>by different case mixes, external site-specific characteristics, <lb/>for example, number of incident COVID-19 cases in the site&apos;s <lb/>catchment area, results will also depend on internal site-specific <lb/>characteristics, for example, availability of resources. Thus, <lb/>global and local effects as well as their interactions need to be <lb/>differentiated carefully in future analyses. <lb/>Within the German Medical Informatics Initiative, all German <lb/>university hospitals have started to establish DIC for the <lb/>purpose of managing, computing, and sharing data extracted <lb/>from EHRs (10). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, <lb/>the four consortia have rapidly assembled their joint expertise <lb/>in data sharing infrastructures and established a concept for <lb/>the National University Medicine (NUM) COVID-19 data and <lb/>technology platform. Even though this analysis was based on <lb/>a first preparatory groundwork and not all German university <lb/>hospitals could yet participate, it nevertheless illustrates the <lb/>potential of such a federated network, which will be extended <lb/>further in the upcoming months. <lb/>As a result of this early effort, we report the results of our <lb/>analysis of inpatient hospital admissions within the German <lb/>COVID-19 lockdown phase compared to the corresponding <lb/>periods in 2018 and 2019, and thus illustrate the change of care <lb/>during the lockdown. Within this work we cannot only reproduce <lb/>and complement other national and international studies with <lb/>results from German university hospitals but can also show that <lb/>the Medical Informatics Initiative&apos;s approach to distributed data <lb/>analysis works for large-scale projects. <lb/>In summary, our study shows that the hospital admission rates <lb/>in Germany were substantially reduced following the national <lb/>COVID-19 lockdown. Notably, these reductions included critical <lb/>clinical situations in which deferral is expected to severely impair <lb/>quality of life and clinical outcomes. Future studies are needed <lb/>to delineate how appropriate medical care of critically ill patients <lb/>can be maintained during a pandemic in particular in the light of <lb/>the anticipated &quot;second wave&quot; of COVID-19. <lb/></body>
