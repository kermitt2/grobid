			<body>Introduction <lb/>Offspring of mothers with a high body mass index (BMI) at the start of pregnancy have a <lb/>higher risk of obesity and obesity-related disorders in later life[1]. Maternal obesity in <lb/>pregnancy is also associated with other offspring outcomes, including neurodevelopmental <lb/>and respiratory outcomes[2-5]. These associations might be explained by shared mother-<lb/>child genetic or postnatal environmental influences, or they could also reflect a causal <lb/>intrauterine mechanism leading to early programming of adverse health in the offspring[6]. <lb/>Disentangling the genetic and shared postnatal environmental effects from a causal <lb/>intrauterine effect is difficult, but there are a number of causal inference approaches that may <lb/>be useful[7]. For example, some studies have used a negative control design whereby the <lb/>association between maternal adiposity and offspring outcome is compared to the association <lb/>between paternal adiposity and the same outcome. The key assumption of the negative <lb/>control design is that both exposures share the same postnatal environmental and genetic <lb/>confounders. A systematic review[8] of such studies, together with subsequent studies not <lb/>included in the review[9-12], have found only limited support for specific effects of maternal <lb/>adiposity on offspring adiposity beyond birth. To our knowledge, similar causal inference <lb/>techniques have not yet been applied to study maternal effects of adiposity in pregnancy on <lb/>other aspects of offspring health. <lb/>If there is a causal intrauterine effect of maternal adiposity on offspring health outcomes, the <lb/>mechanism is unclear. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, might partly <lb/>mediate associations between maternal and offspring phenotypes by causing changes to gene <lb/>expression that are mitotically heritable[6,13-15]. Differential DNA methylation has been <lb/>reported when assessing offspring exposed in utero to extreme maternal undernutrition[16-<lb/>19], maternal morbid obesity[20] and less extreme maternal underweight and maternal <lb/>obesity[21], in comparison to those not exposed; yet weak or no evidence has been found for <lb/>associations between continuous maternal BMI and offspring DNA methylation, whether <lb/>globally[22,23], at specific loci identified in array[21,24,25] or at candidate genes[26]. <lb/>However, individual studies were limited in sample size and thus underpowered to detect <lb/>differential methylation. Meta-analysis of results from multiple individual cohorts increases <lb/>sample size and power to detect differential methylation, but this approach has rarely been <lb/>employed in the field of epigenetic epidemiology. <lb/>Comprising many birth cohorts from around the world, the Pregnancy and Childhood <lb/>Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium 25 was established to facilitate meta-analysis of epigenome-<lb/>wide studies relevant to maternal and childhood health and disease. In this PACE study, we <lb/>meta-analysed harmonised cohort-specific epigenome-wide data on associations between <lb/>maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and DNA methylation in the blood of newborns. We <lb/>then conducted further analyses (Figure 1) to explore whether these associations could be <lb/>reproduced in adolescent samples and implemented causal inference methods to evaluate the <lb/>potential confounding effects of shared environment and genetic variation. <lb/>Results <lb/>Study characteristics <lb/>We meta-analysed results from 19 independent cohorts to test the association between <lb/>maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and epigenome-wide newborn blood DNA <lb/>methylation. A summary of methods used by each cohort is provided in Supplementary File <lb/>S1 Table S1, with a more detailed description in Supplementary File S2. Supplementary File <lb/>S1 Table S2 lists sample sizes and summarises EWAS results for each cohort and meta-<lb/>analysis. For our primary model, with continuous maternal BMI as the exposure, we analysed <lb/>results from 7,523 mother-child pairs. The overall sample size-weighted mean maternal BMI <lb/>was 24.4 kg/m 2 (range of cohort-specific means: 22.8, 27.8). In secondary analyses, we <lb/>examined World Health Organisation categories for maternal BMI, comparing normal weight <lb/>women (n=4,834) to i) overweight or obese women combined (n=2,885 women, of whom <lb/>1,299 were obese) and ii) underweight women (n=211 women). The majority of participants <lb/>were of European ancestry. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of each cohort. <lb/>Maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy is associated with widespread differences in <lb/>newborn blood DNA methylation of modest magnitude <lb/>When treated as a continuous variable, maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy was associated <lb/>with differential methylation in newborn blood at 9,044 sites (Supplementary File S1 Table <lb/>S3) before and 104 sites (Supplementary File S1 Table S4) after adjustment for cell-counts <lb/>(Bonferroni correction for 473,864 tests P&lt;1.06*10 -7 ); 86 sites were common to both models. <lb/>Before adjustment for cell-counts, lambdas (λ), a measure of P-value inflation, were <lb/>generally high and QQ plots showed inflation of P-values in most cohorts (Table 2, <lb/>Supplementary File S1 Table S2, Supplementary File S3). Values for λ were closer to 1 for <lb/>most cohorts after adjustment for estimated cell counts. In a meta-analysis of results from two <lb/>of the larger cohorts, ALSPAC and Generation R (λ=1.60), λ was not substantially further <lb/>reduced after removal of potential outliers using the Tukey method[27] (λ=1.58) or additional <lb/>adjustment for 10 ancestry principal components (λ=1.67). <lb/>Sites associated with maternal BMI were spread over the genome and did not tend to be <lb/>restricted to certain regions (Figure 2). Effect sizes were modest, with the median absolute <lb/>effect at the genome-wide significant sites being a difference in methylation beta value of <lb/>0.0003 per one unit (kg/m 2 ) increase in maternal BMI (i.e. a 0.03% absolute change, range: <lb/>0.15% decrease to 0.13% increase). At most of the Bonferroni-significant sites (8,899/9,044 <lb/>and 96/104), higher maternal BMI was associated with lower newborn blood methylation. <lb/>Results from the primary model, where the exposure was continuous BMI, were consistent <lb/>with those from a binary comparison of maternal overweight/obesity (BMI&gt;25) with normal <lb/>weight (BMI 18.5 to 25): the Spearman&apos;s coefficient for correlation between regression <lb/>coefficients was 0.70. Maternal overweight/obesity was associated with differential newborn <lb/>blood methylation at 4,037 sites (Supplementary File S1 Table S5) before and 159 sites <lb/>(Supplementary File S1 Table S6) after cell-adjustment (P&lt;1.06*10 -7 ), compared with normal <lb/>weight. The crossover between these 159 sites and the 104 identified with P&lt;1.06*10 -7 in the <lb/>cell-adjusted continuous model was just 21/104, but 150/159 were associated with continuous <lb/>BMI after correction for multiple testing at 159 sites (FDR-corrected P&lt;0.05). The direction <lb/>of effect for the binary comparison was consistent with that for the continuous exposure at all <lb/>159 sites. As expected, the magnitude of effect was larger when BMI was binary than when <lb/>BMI was continuous, but the median effect at sites with P&lt;1.06*10 -7 was still modest (0.31% <lb/>decrease in mean methylation beta value in the overweight/obese group compared to the <lb/>normal weight group). <lb/>Eight sites (Supplementary File S1 Table S7) were associated with maternal underweight <lb/>(BMI&lt;18.5) compared to normal weight with P&lt;1.06*10 -7 , but this analysis was likely <lb/>underpowered given the small number of underweight women (n=211), and there was large <lb/>inter-study heterogeneity in results (I 2 median 62.3, range 0 to 91.3). Given these results, we <lb/>did not explore the association between maternal underweight and offspring methylation any <lb/>further. <lb/>Adjusting for cellular heterogeneity greatly attenuates associations between <lb/>maternal BMI and newborn blood DNA methylation <lb/>As mentioned above, adjusting for estimated cell proportions in newborn blood samples <lb/>greatly reduced the number of sites associated with maternal BMI with P-values&lt;1.06*10 -7 <lb/>(Figure 3). This reduction in signal was seen in all meta-analyses and most individual cohort <lb/>analyses (Table 2). At all 9,044 sites associated with continuous maternal BMI, adjusting for <lb/>cell counts shifted the effect size towards the null. The median relative change in estimate <lb/>after adjustment was 52% and 9,007/9,044 sites attenuated by 10% or more. After <lb/>adjustment, the precision of the estimates at 8,984/9,044 sites was increased (i.e. the standard <lb/>error was reduced). Taken together, this suggests that much of the association between <lb/>maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and newborn DNA methylation is due to varying cell <lb/>type proportions. <lb/>Surprisingly, however, estimated cell proportions were not strongly correlated with maternal <lb/>BMI in any of the five cohorts that supplied these data (Supplementary File S1 Table S8). <lb/>Given this, we hypothesised that large changes in estimates might indicate measurement error <lb/>in estimated cell counts, and that this measurement error might be due to an adult whole <lb/>blood reference panel being used to estimate cell counts in cord/newborn blood samples. <lb/>However, we found little evidence for this: Cord blood reference panels by Andrews &amp; <lb/>Bakulski[28], Gervin et al.[29] and deGoede et al.[30] became available after we had <lb/>finalised the meta-analysis results. When we used each of these references to estimate cell <lb/>proportions in ALSPAC cord blood samples, regression coefficients and P-values were <lb/>similar to those obtained when an adult reference panel was used in this cohort. Of the 86 <lb/>sites where maternal BMI was associated with newborn methylation before and after <lb/>adjustment for cell counts in the meta-analysis (P&lt;1.06*10 -7 ), 15 were associated with <lb/>maternal BMI with P&lt;0.05 in ALSPAC when an adult reference panel was used. Of these 15 <lb/>sites, 12 sites also had P&lt;0.05 when any of the cord blood reference panels were used. The <lb/>percentage change in estimates between models using the adult and cord blood reference <lb/>panels was under 10% at 14/15 sites using the Andrews and Bakulski reference (median <lb/>percentage change in estimates: 4.1), under 10% at 14/15 sites using the Gervin et al. <lb/>reference (median percentage change in estimates: 3.4) and under 10% at 12/15 using the <lb/>deGoede reference (median percentage change in estimates: 3.7). Furthermore, cell counts <lb/>estimated using any of the three cord blood references correlated relatively well with each <lb/>other (median Spearman&apos;s correlation coefficient: 0.67, range: -0.05 to 0.95), but were not <lb/>correlated with maternal BMI (median Spearman&apos;s correlation coefficient: 0.007, range: -<lb/>0.10 to 0.15) (Supplementary File S1 Table S8). Although maternal BMI was not associated <lb/>with estimated cell proportions in our data, others have observed that maternal BMI is <lb/>associated with cord blood cellular heterogeneity[31,32], in addition, some random <lb/>variability in cell distribution across the range of maternal BMI can be expected. Therefore, <lb/>we believe that adjustment is appropriate and indeed necessary. <lb/>Further analysis of 86 sites where maternal BMI is associated with newborn DNA <lb/>methylation both before and after adjustment for cell counts <lb/>For further analysis, we selected the 86 sites where maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy <lb/>was associated with offspring newborn blood DNA methylation both before and after <lb/>adjustment for estimated cell proportions (Table 3), and performed subsequent analyses using <lb/>the cell-adjusted model. We used three main strategies to determine the robustness of our <lb/>findings at these 86 sites: <lb/>Firstly, we assessed inter-study heterogeneity and influence of individual studies. There was <lb/>weak to moderate heterogeneity at most sites; I 2 was less than 40% at 57/86 sites (median <lb/>31.2%, range 0.0 to 70.6%) and 31/86 sites had a heterogeneity P-value &lt;0.05. In a <lb/>comparison of estimates from random-and fixed-effects meta-analysis models, the <lb/>percentage change in estimates was &lt;10% for 72/86 sites (median percentage change in <lb/>estimates: 2.8). In the random effects model, the largest p-value at the 86 sites was 0.0058 <lb/>and 20/86 sites had P&lt;1.06*10 -7 , despite lower power compared to the fixed effects model. <lb/>Forest plots and results of a leave-one-out analysis showed that results from most cohorts <lb/>agreed on the direction of effect at the 86 top sites and no single cohort consistently had a <lb/>disproportionately large influence on the meta-analysis (Supplementary File S3). <lb/>Secondly, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricting the meta-analysis to 15/19 cohorts <lb/>comprising participants of European origin only. The results from this sensitivity analysis <lb/>were consistent with those of the main analysis. The Spearman&apos;s correlation coefficient for <lb/>regression coefficients was 0.91, and the percentage change in estimates was &gt;10% for 47/86 <lb/>sites (median percentage change in estimates: 9.7%). While this modest difference could <lb/>reflect confounding by ancestry, it might also result from the fact that the cohorts of non-<lb/>European ancestry tended to have a higher mean maternal BMI and were more variable <lb/>compared to the European ancestry cohorts (Table 1). <lb/>Thirdly, we compared the 86 sites to a list of 190,672 probes on the Illumina 450k platform <lb/>that Naeem et al.[33] suggested might give spurious readings (Supplementary File S1 Table <lb/>S9). Forty-two sites were on this list: seven located in regions containing SNPs, 11 in regions <lb/>containing repeat sequences and four in regions where insertions or deletions are found. <lb/>These sites may be more likely to contain outlier values that influence results, however <lb/>diptests for multimodality[34] and visual inspection of density plots of methylation beta <lb/>values in ALSPAC and GOYA did not support this (P&gt;0.05; Supplementary File S3). <lb/>Additionally, all cohort-specific analyses were conducted using robust linear regression, <lb/>which is designed to be robust to outliers in the outcome variable (methylation). Other <lb/>reasons that probes had been flagged by Naeem et al. as potentially problematic were that <lb/>they hybridise to multiple genomic loci (four sites), did not produce results consistent with <lb/>those produced by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (nine sites) and were particularly <lb/>susceptible to errors in bisulfite conversion (four sites). <lb/>Maternal BMI-associated newborn blood methylation sites are not enriched for <lb/>
			certain biological processes or pathways <lb/>Maternal BMI-associated newborn blood methylation sites were spread throughout the <lb/>genome and did not appear to cluster in certain chromosomal regions. The 86 maternal BMI-<lb/>associated methylation sites are near 77 gene regions, and there were several instances where <lb/>multiple sites mapped to the same gene: RBMS1 [3 sites], POM121L1P [3 sites], VIPR2 [2 <lb/>sites], SQLE [2 sites], RASA3 [2 sites], MIR200B [2 sites], KAT6B [2 sites]. The list of 77 <lb/>genes was not enriched for any gene ontology (GO) term (Supplementary File S1 Table S10) <lb/>or KEGG pathway (Supplementary File S1 Table S11) after FDR-correction for multiple <lb/>testing, but this analysis was likely underpowered. <lb/>Associations between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and newborn DNA <lb/>methylation were reproduced in the whole blood of adolescents at most sites <lb/>In order to assess whether associations at birth are also present in later childhood, four <lb/>cohorts (BAMSE, IOW birth cohort [IOW F1], PIAMA, and RAINE; total n=1,817 mother-<lb/>child pairs) contributed results to a meta-analysis of maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy <lb/>and methylation in the whole blood of adolescent offspring (age range: 15 to 18). Cohorts are <lb/>summarised in Table 4. These cohorts were completely independent of those that contributed <lb/>results to the newborn analysis, therefore we were able to assess reproducibility of our <lb/>newborn results later in life. All models discussed here were corrected for estimated cell <lb/>counts. Full results are provided in Supplementary File S1 Table S12. <lb/>There was evidence for reproducible associations at most of the 86 sites: The direction of <lb/>association at adolescence was the same as that at birth for 72/86 sites (Spearman correlation <lb/>coefficient: 0.67). Twenty-two of these 72 sites had a P-value &lt;0.05 at adolescence, despite <lb/>the much smaller sample size. Although no associations survived correction for multiple <lb/>testing at 86 sites, 22/72 sites with nominal P-values &lt;0.05 is higher than the 5% expected by <lb/>chance alone (Kolmogorov P=3.3*10 -16 ). Across the 72 sites where effects were in the same <lb/>direction, the effect estimates in the adolescence analysis were a median of 2.25 times smaller <lb/>(i.e. closer to the null) than the effect estimates in the newborn analysis (range: 2889 times <lb/>smaller to 1.35 times larger) but at some sites, estimates at both time points were remarkably <lb/>similar (Figure 4). It is also of particular note that six of the top ten sites with the largest <lb/>effect size were the same at birth and adolescence. These sites were cg05837990 (CDHR3), <lb/>cg13403462 (ACTL10/NECAB3), cg27179375 (POM121L1P), cg12009398 (VIPR2), <lb/>cg20594982 (AGRN) and cg21445553 (GGTLC1). One of the top ten sites with the smallest <lb/>P-values was also common to both analyses: cg05086444 (VIPR2). <lb/>Negative control design supports a causal intrauterine effect of maternal BMI on <lb/>newborn blood methylation at nine sites <lb/>We used a negative control design[7] in an attempt to disentangle a potential causal, <lb/>intrauterine effect of maternal BMI on newborn blood methylation from spurious associations <lb/>due to confounding by shared genetics or postnatal environment. Estimates for associations <lb/>between maternal BMI and offspring DNA methylation were compared to the equivalent <lb/>estimates for paternal BMI, which would not normally be expected to affect the intrauterine <lb/>environment. A maternal association that was stronger than a paternal association could <lb/>support a causal intrauterine mechanism, whereas consistent maternal and paternal estimates <lb/>would provide evidence for confounding by genetic or shared postnatal environmental <lb/>factors. It is also important to adjust the maternal estimate for paternal BMI, and vice versa, <lb/>because maternal and paternal BMI are somewhat correlated (range Spearman&apos;s correlation <lb/>coefficients in contributing cohorts = 0.18 to 0.25, p&lt;0.001). <lb/>Seven cohorts contributed results to this analysis: ALSPAC (n=619), CHAMACOS (n=180), <lb/>Generation R (n=829), GOYA (n=422), MEDALL (INMA and EDEN pooled n=316), <lb/>NHBCS (n=96) and RICHS (n=92). The total number of families included in the meta-<lb/>analysis of the mutually adjusted models was 2,554. Results for all models are provided in <lb/>Supplementary File S1 Table S13. <lb/>Based on the above criteria, we found some evidence for a causal intrauterine effect of <lb/>maternal BMI on newborn blood methylation at some sites: At 64 of 86 sites, the paternal and <lb/>maternal effect estimates were in the same direction. At 40 of these 64 sites, the maternal <lb/>BMI estimate was greater than the paternal BMI estimate after mutual adjustment (median <lb/>2.19 times greater, range 1.01 to 142.4 times greater). At nine of these 40 sites, there was <lb/>some evidence of heterogeneity between the mutually adjusted maternal and paternal BMI <lb/>estimates (I 2 &gt;40; Table S13). These criteria were used to define support for a possible <lb/>maternal specific, intrauterine effect. Therefore, at 77/86 sites, evidence from this negative <lb/>control study was more supportive of the association between maternal BMI and newborn <lb/>blood methylation being explained by genetic or shared prenatal environmental factors than a <lb/>causal intrauterine effect. Figure 5 displays the results for the 20 sites where the mutually <lb/>adjusted maternal and paternal BMI estimates were in the same direction, with the maternal <lb/>effect being larger than the paternal effect and having a P-value &lt;0.05 (Figure 5). <lb/>meQTLs at maternal BMI-associated cord blood methylation sites provide further <lb/>support for confounding by genetics at four sites <lb/>To explore the genetic influence on DNA methylation at the 86 maternal BMI-associated <lb/>cord blood methylation sites, we performed a look-up in an online catalogue of methylation <lb/>quantitative trait loci (meQTL) that were previously identified using ALSPAC data[35]. We <lb/>identified 821 meQTLs where genetic variation was associated with cord blood DNA <lb/>methylation at 27/86 sites with P&lt;1*10 -7 . Of these 821 meQTLs, 68 were within 1Mb of the <lb/>methylation site (cis) and 753 were outside of this window (trans). <lb/>Genetic variation at cis-meQTLs could suggest that the association between maternal BMI <lb/>and newborn methylation is confounded by shared genetics. There were 225/821 meQTLs <lb/>available in the results of the largest adult BMI GWAS meta-analysis to date, conducted by <lb/>the GIANT consortium [36]. Of these, 17/225 were only nominally associated (P&lt;0.05) with <lb/>BMI in GIANT. These 17 meQTLs were associated with cis methylation at four CpGs: 11 <lb/>with cg03258665 (EPHA2), four with cg00285394 (SQLE), one with cg03719642 (UCKL1) <lb/>and one <lb/>with cg18268562 (FOXR1). For most of the meQTLs, the associations SNP-BMI and SNP-<lb/>methylation were in opposite directions. Thus, the same effect allele was associated with <lb/>higher BMI (effect estimates ranging 0.007 to 0.015) and lower methylation (effect estimates <lb/>ranging -0.523 to -0.235). Only in the rs8567-cg03719642 association was the effect allele <lb/>associated with lower BMI (effect estimate: -0.012) and higher methylation (effect estimate: <lb/>0.287). <lb/>Using a combination of evidence, we identified 8 sites where maternal BMI may have <lb/>a causal intrauterine effect on newborn blood methylation <lb/>As described above, by employing a negative control design, we found nine sites where the <lb/>estimated effect of maternal BMI was stronger than that of paternal BMI. One of these sites <lb/>(cg18268562 at FOXR1) is an meQTL that was nominally associated with BMI in GIANT. <lb/>Therefore, we find strongest support for a causal intrauterine effect of maternal BMI at the <lb/>start of pregnancy on newborn blood methylation at eight sites (Table 5). At the remaining 78 <lb/>of our top 86 sites, the apparent associations between maternal BMI and newborn blood <lb/>methylation might be more appropriately explained by shared mother-offspring genetic and <lb/>postnatal environmental factors. These findings are summarised in Supplementary File S1 <lb/>Table S14. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We found that maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy is associated with modest variation in <lb/>newborn blood DNA methylation at 86 sites throughout the genome, after adjusting for cell <lb/>types. At around a quarter of these 86 sites, we found nominal associations between maternal <lb/>pre-pregnancy BMI and DNA methylation in an independent cohort of adolescents, <lb/>sometimes with remarkably consistent effect sizes to those found in neonates. However, <lb/>when we employed two causal inference strategies, we found supporting evidence for a <lb/>causal intrauterine effect at only eight sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the <lb/>effects of maternal pre-pregnancy adiposity on neonatal blood DNA methylation are <lb/>primarily related to variations in the cellular distributions in cord blood, as well as shared <lb/>environment and genetic variation. However, 8 CpGs demonstrated consistent associations <lb/>that were unperturbed by confounder adjustment or causal inference methods suggesting a <lb/>causal intrauterine effect. <lb/>While previous studies have concluded that there are strong associations between maternal <lb/>
			BMI/adiposity and DNA methylation in neonates[21,24-26,37,38], there is a lack of <lb/>consistency in terms of the specific loci identified to date. Although we replicated, at look-up <lb/>level of significance, an inverse association between maternal BMI and newborn blood <lb/>methylation at cg01422136 (ZCCHC10) that was reported in a study of African American <lb/>and Haitian mother-child pairs from the Boston Birth Cohort[24], this association was not <lb/>epigenome-wide significant in our study (P=0.0016). We did not replicate specific <lb/>associations reported in other previous studies of maternal BMI and newborn blood <lb/>methylation, including some that were reported in individual studies from the PACE <lb/>consortium[21,25,26,37,38]. This lack of consistency highlights the potential presence of <lb/>false positive findings in small EWAS studies and the importance of meta-analysis for <lb/>improving power and reproducibility. <lb/>As we have mentioned, the effect sizes at our 86 Bonferroni-significant sites were modest; all <lb/>were less than a 0.15% change in methylation per one-unit increase in maternal BMI. This <lb/>could raise questions about the biological significance of these effects, it is also important to <lb/>note that very large differences would not be expected. For example, for a woman of average <lb/>height in a US population (163 cm) a one-unit increase in BMI would correspond to weight <lb/>gain from 59 to 64.4 kg. Furthermore, it should be noted that these modest effects are <lb/>consistent across 19 studies, so they are unlikely to have arisen due to chance, study-specific <lb/>biases, or technical aspects of the array, which should be independent of our exposure. <lb/>Therefore, we believe that the associations at our 86 Bonferroni-significant sites are robust, <lb/>regardless of whether or not they are causal. We also note that it is as yet unclear what <lb/>constitutes a small or a large biologically-significant effect in terms of DNA methylation, and <lb/>studies have shown that small changes in DNA methylation can be related to pronounced <lb/>changes in gene expression and biological function[39,40]. One reason we may not have <lb/>observed larger effect sizes is that the studied cohorts consisted mostly of women whose <lb/>weight fell within the WHO BMI category of normal weight. Perhaps the largest effects only <lb/>exist at the extremities of the BMI distribution, as is the case with some other maternal BMI-<lb/>associated offspring phenotypes, including offspring BMI[6]. . The statistical power afforded <lb/>by meta-analysis has enabled us to detect very small effects that would be missed by <lb/>individual studies, but which may be biologically important. <lb/>Although our 86 maternal BMI-associated methylation sites were not enriched for any GO <lb/>term or KEGG pathway, this analysis was likely underpowered. The sites mapped to 77 <lb/>genes, some of which may have functional relevance linking maternal adiposity to offspring <lb/>health outcomes, either through shared genetic factors or an epigenetic effect. For example, <lb/>GWAS studies have identified variants at some of these loci associated with adiposity-related <lb/>traits: total energy total energy expenditure (CDHR3[41]), energy intake (PTPRN2[41]), <lb/>lipoprotein-a levels (DSCAML1[42]), adiponectin levels (CREG2[43]), and type 2 diabetes <lb/>(ANK1, RBMS1[44-46]). <lb/>The list of 86 maternal BMI-associated differentially methylated sites also includes several <lb/>where methylation and/or gene expression has previously been linked to adiposity-related <lb/>traits. For example, greater whole blood methylation at cg17782974 (TRIM8) was associated <lb/>with higher maternal BMI in our study and higher own BMI in elderly participants in the <lb/>Lothian Birth Cohort study[47]. Another 450k study found that several sites at PTPRN2 were <lb/>hypermethylated in subcutaneous adipose tissue of women before gastric-bypass compared to <lb/>the same women after gastric-bypass and associated weight-loss[48], whereas we found that <lb/>higher maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy was associated with hypomethylation at <lb/>PTPRN2 in newborn blood. Finally, we found that higher maternal BMI at the start of <lb/>pregnancy was associated with lower newborn methylation at a site (cg03221837) near IRX3. <lb/>More copies of the risk allele at the obesity-associated SNP FTO is associated with higher <lb/>blood expression of IRX3 in humans, and IRX3-deficient mice have been shown to have a 25-<lb/>30% reduction in body weight[49]. However, it is important to note that although IRX3 was <lb/>the nearest gene to the maternal BMI-associated methylation site in our study, the site was <lb/>actually 299,591 bp downstream from the gene. <lb/>We were particularly interested to find two sites (cg12009398, cg05086444) on the gene <lb/>body of VIPR2 where greater maternal BMI was associated with lower methylation. The <lb/>associations were consistent in adolescents, with P-values &lt;0.008, although we did not find <lb/>any evidence that the associations were causal. VIPR2 encodes vasoactive intestinal peptide <lb/>receptor 2 (VIPR2), which functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuroendocrine hormone. <lb/>The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family is involved in homeostasis of the immune <lb/>system, with a general anti-inflammatory effect[50], while VIPR2 plays a role in the control <lb/>of digestive function in particular[51]. A GWA analysis in 1,000 participants found that the <lb/>VIP pathway was strongly associated with fat mass and with BMI, suggesting that the VIP <lb/>pathway may play an important role in the development of obesity[52]. In a study using the <lb/>450k array, lower VIPR2 methylation was found in the saliva of children with attention <lb/>deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), relative to controls[53], albeit at different sites than <lb/>those identified in the present study. Given previously identified associations between <lb/>maternal BMI and offspring ADHD[54-57], further work is warranted to explore the extent <lb/>to which VIPR2 gene function (driven either by genetic variation or regulation by <lb/>methylation) might mediate associations between maternal adiposity and neurodevelopment <lb/>of the offspring. <lb/>Of the 86 sites where maternal BMI was associated with methylation in the blood of <lb/>newborns, 72 showed the same direction of association in the blood of an independent <lb/>smaller sample of adolescents. At some sites, effect estimates were remarkably consistent <lb/>between the two age groups. Of particular note, six of the top 10 sites with the strongest <lb/>effect size in the cell-adjusted newborn analysis also had the strongest effect size amongst <lb/>adolescents. This consistency from birth to adolescence could be explained as either i) an <lb/>intrauterine influence of maternal BMI on changes to offspring DNA methylation that persist <lb/>to adolescence, ii) confounding by shared familial genetic and/or environmental influences on <lb/>maternal BMI and offspring methylation that remain stable over time, or iii) the possibility <lb/>that both maternal pre-/early-pregnancy and the child&apos;s own BMI have independent effects on <lb/>the child&apos;s methylation. We did not adjust for child&apos;s BMI because that may introduce a <lb/>collider that would bias the association between shared familial factors and maternal BMI <lb/>away from the null. <lb/>We were interested in whether the 86 maternal BMI-associated sites represented a causal <lb/>intrauterine effect of maternal adiposity on offspring methylation, or if associations were <lb/>better explained by confounding by shared environment or genetics. By employing a negative <lb/>control design, we found nine sites where the estimated effect of maternal BMI was larger <lb/>than that of paternal BMI, after mutual adjustment. Maternal and paternal BMI were not <lb/>strongly correlated in any of the cohorts that took part in this analysis (Spearman&apos;s R ranging <lb/>0.13 to 0.25), so collinearity in the mutually adjusted models is unlikely to bias interpretation <lb/>of results. This is supported by the observation that standard errors did not increase <lb/>substantially between the unadjusted and adjusted models. At one of the nine sites <lb/>(cg18269562 mapping to FOXR1), cord blood methylation has previously been strongly <lb/>associated (P&lt;1*10 -7 ) with common genetic variants[35]. This meQTL was also nominally <lb/>associated (P&lt;0.05) with BMI in the GIANT consortium adult BMI GWAS meta-<lb/>analysis[36,58]. We considered that the association between maternal BMI and newborn <lb/>methylation at this site was likely driven by a shared genetic effect. Therefore we could be <lb/>most confident that at 8/86 sites there may be a causal intrauterine effect of maternal <lb/>adiposity on methylation of blood DNA in newborns. At the remaining 78/86 sites, shared <lb/>genetic and/or postnatal environmental factors, which would be expected to be the same <lb/>whether the exposure were maternal or paternal BMI, may have larger influences on newborn <lb/>blood methylation than maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy. <lb/>These findings are in line with recent studies reporting that a large proportion of variation in <lb/>DNA methylation is explained by genetics. One study estimated that at around 50% of CpG <lb/>sites on the Illumina 450k array methylation has a substantial genetic component[59]. <lb/>Another study of DNA methylation using the same platform in 237 neonates found that, of <lb/>1423 genomic regions that were highly variable across individuals, 25% were best explained <lb/>by genotype alone and 75% by an interaction of genotype with different in utero <lb/>environmental factors (including maternal BMI)[60]. These studies, along with our own, <lb/>highlight complex relationships between genetic inheritance, intrauterine environmental <lb/>exposures and offspring epigenetics. In light of this, we recommend that where the exposure <lb/>is genetically heritable, extra care should be taken to avoid over-interpreting EWAS results as <lb/>representing causal environmental effects[61]. Causal analysis techniques, such as the <lb/>negative control and meQTL analyses conducted in this study, will be useful in this regard. <lb/>It will be interesting to explore in further work how maternal adiposity-associated exposures <lb/>during pregnancy, such as gestational weight gain, maternal hypertension and hyperglycemia, <lb/>influence offspring DNA methylation. Such pregnancy exposures may be more likely to have <lb/>a pronounced intrauterine effect on offspring methylation and/or developmental <lb/>programming of health outcomes than maternal adiposity at the start of pregnancy. Although <lb/>previous studies in ALSPAC[21] and MoBa[62] did not identify any sites where gestational <lb/>weight gain was associated with cord blood methylation, the question should be revisited in a <lb/>consortium context. <lb/>DNA methylation shows strong tissue-specificity, for example, one study found that BMI <lb/>was associated with DNA methylation in adipose tissue, but not in peripheral blood <lb/>leukocytes[63]. Conversely, a large EWAS found that BMI was associated with methylation <lb/>at HIF3A in both blood and adipose tissues[64]. Therefore, further exploration is warranted to <lb/>assess the degree to which methylation in blood correlates with that in other tissues. <lb/>However, in the context of this study, offspring blood might be considered a mechanistically <lb/>relevant tissue: Blood cellular heterogeneity and leukocyte methylation are strongly <lb/>associated with inflammation, which is considered chronic amongst those with obesity. As <lb/>has been shown for maternal smoking[65], newborn blood methylation at our top sites could <lb/>be a useful exposure indicator in samples that are missing data on maternal BMI. For this <lb/>purpose, it does not matter that the associations we identified are not causal. Likewise, <lb/>newborn blood methylation might also be predictive of offspring outcomes, capturing both <lb/>genetic and environmental influences of maternal adiposity. <lb/>There are several strengths to our study, including the large sample size comprised of <lb/>established cohorts, the use of robust statistical methods, the comprehensive analysis of <lb/>results and the application of causal inference techniques. Limitations include: i) adiposity is <lb/>a complex trait that is only crudely and indirectly measured by BMI, therefore an <lb/>investigation of more specific measures of adiposity might yield different results, ii) cohorts <lb/>collected data on BMI in different ways (measured/self-reported) at different times (pre-<lb/>pregnancy/early pregnancy). However, measured and self-reported BMI before and during <lb/>early pregnancy are strongly correlated[66], so we do not believe this will bias our results <lb/>substantially. iii) The analysis was completed before the widespread availability of any cord <lb/>blood reference panels for estimations of cell counts, so all cohorts used an adult whole blood <lb/>reference panel, which may introduce measurement error in cell count estimates[28]. <lb/>However, in ALSPAC, one of the largest participating cohorts, we found that adjusting for <lb/>cell counts generated using any one of three recently released cord blood reference panels <lb/>produced results consistent with those produced using the adult whole blood reference. iv) <lb/>We had very limited data with repeat measures in the same individuals at birth and <lb/>adolescence, so we did not explore change in methylation over time in a longitudinal model. <lb/>v) Cohorts used different methods to normalise data. However, a previous PACE analysis[67] <lb/>found that results obtained using raw betas were similar to those obtained using normalized <lb/>betas generated with various methods, which indicates that this did not impact the inferences <lb/>drawn from the meta-analysis, and at any rate, bias would tend to limit power rather than <lb/>introduce spurious associations. vi) Although we have presented two lines of evidence <lb/>(consistent maternal and paternal estimates and the presence of meQTLs) that provide <lb/>support for a genetic component in explaining associations between maternal BMI and <lb/>newborn blood methylation at some sites, we were unable to formally quantify the relative <lb/>contribution of genetics and the intrauterine environment. Techniques that attempt to do so, <lb/>such as M-GCTA[68], require genetic and methylation data on larger sample sizes than were <lb/>available in any individual cohort. vii) The Illumina 450k array only covers 1.7% of CpG <lb/>sites on the human genome, and most of these are located in promoter regions. We found <lb/>robust associations between maternal BMI and newborn DNA methylation despite this low <lb/>coverage and bias. We therefore encourage more studies on this topic using more advanced <lb/>EWAS platforms (such as the Illumina EPIC array). viii) Finally, it is possible that <lb/>epigenetic markers other than DNA methylation in cord blood may be more closely <lb/>associated with maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy, but this was not explored in this <lb/>study. <lb/>In conclusion, we observed associations between maternal pre/early-pregnancy BMI and <lb/>DNA methylation at 86 sites in the blood of newborns, some of which were reproduced in <lb/>adolescents. However, effect sizes were modest and causal inference strategies provided <lb/>support for causal effects at just eight sites. Therefore, we conclude that the limited range of <lb/>variability in maternal adiposity observed in most of our studies, as measured by BMI, does <lb/>not have a substantial causal effect on newborn blood DNA methylation. This meta-analysis <lb/>highlights the potential for large-scale collaborative research to understand epigenetic effects <lb/>of conditions in early life, and to apply causal inference techniques in epigenetic <lb/>epidemiology. <lb/>

			Methods <lb/>Figure 1 gives an outline of the design of this study. <lb/>Participating cohorts <lb/>A total of 23 independent cohorts participated. Detailed methods for each cohort are provided <lb/>in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary File S2) and summarised in Supplementary <lb/>File S1 Table S1. <lb/>Nineteen cohorts participated in the meta-analysis of maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy <lb/>and newborn blood DNA methylation: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children <lb/>(ALSPAC)[69-71]; two independent datasets from the Californian Birth Cohort <lb/>(CBC_Hispanics and CBC_Caucasians) [72]; Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers <lb/>and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS); Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation <lb/>(EARLI) [73]; the Genome-Wide Population-based Association Study of Extremely <lb/>Overweight Young Adults (GOYA), which is a sample from the Danish National Birth <lb/>Cohort [74,75]; Groningen Expert Center for Kids with Obesity (GECKO); Generation R <lb/>(GENR)[76]; Genetics of Glycemic Regulation in Gestation and Growth (GEN3G)[77]; the <lb/>Isle of Wight Birth Cohort third generation (IOW F2) [78]; two cohorts from the FP7 project <lb/>Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy (MEDALL), INfancia y Medio Ambiente <lb/>(INMA) [79] and a study on the pre-and early postnatal; determinants of child health and <lb/>development (EDEN)[80], were pooled and analysed as a single cohort referred to as <lb/>MEDALL; three independent datasets from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study <lb/>(MOBA1, MOBA2, MOBA3)[81,82]; the Norway Facial Clefts Study (NFCS), the Newborn <lb/>Epigenetic Study (NEST)[83,84]; the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS); the <lb/>Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS)[85] and Project Viva (Viva). <lb/>An additional four independent cohorts participated in the meta-analysis of maternal BMI at <lb/>the start of pregnancy and offspring whole blood DNA methylation at adolescence (ages 15-<lb/>18): the Children Allergy Milieu Stockholm Epidemiology cohort (BAMSE) [86], IOW birth <lb/>cohort second generation (IOW F1), the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite <lb/>Allergy birth cohort (PIAMA), the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort (RAINE). <lb/>All cohorts acquired ethics approval and informed consent from participants prior to data <lb/>collection through local ethics committees. Full details are provided in Supplementary File <lb/>S2. <lb/>Maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy <lb/>In each cohort, maternal BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)) was calculated from either self-<lb/>reported or measured height and weight, either before pregnancy or early in the first trimester <lb/>(Supplementary File S1 Table S1). Cohorts were asked to double check values ≥5 standard <lb/>deviations from the mean to ensure that they were not data entry errors. Primarily, we were <lb/>interested in the effects of maternal BMI as a continuous variable, but also investigated <lb/>World Health Organization categories of maternal overweight or obesity (≥25.0 kg/m2), and <lb/>underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m2), compared to a normal weight reference group (18.5-24.9 <lb/>kg/m2). <lb/>Covariates <lb/>All cohorts ran models adjusted for maternal age (years), maternal social class (variable <lb/>defined by each individual cohort), maternal smoking status (the preferred categorization was <lb/>into three groups: no smoking in pregnancy, stopped smoking in early pregnancy, smoking <lb/>throughout pregnancy, but a binary categorization of any versus no smoking was also <lb/>acceptable) and parity (the preferred categorization was into two groups: no previous <lb/>children, one or more previous children). <lb/>Each cohort also adjusted for technical covariates using methods suitable for that cohort <lb/>(Supplementary File S1 Table S1). Certain cohorts also included additional covariates to <lb/>correct for study design/sampling factors where needed (Supplementary File S1 Table S1). <lb/>For GOYA, which is a case-control study where case mothers have a BMI&gt;32kg/m 2 and <lb/>control mothers have a BMI anywhere within the normal distribution, we restricted the <lb/>continuous maternal BMI models to a randomly selected sub-group with a normal BMI <lb/>distribution to avoid confounding by substructure. Binary comparison models were run using <lb/>the whole GOYA cohort with no additional adjustment for substructure. <lb/>We hypothesised that BMI might influence newborn blood cellular composition, so each <lb/>cohort additionally adjusted for cell proportions by including the estimated variables as <lb/>covariates. All cohorts independently estimated cell counts using the estimateCellCounts <lb/>function in the minfi R package, which is based on the method developed by <lb/>Houseman[87,88]. The cohort-specific analyses, as well as the meta-analyses, were <lb/>completed before a cord blood reference set was widely available, so cohorts used an adult <lb/>whole blood reference to estimate cell counts[89]. This estimated the proportion of B-cells, <lb/>CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, granulocytes, NK-cells and monocytes in each sample. <lb/>NHBCS, RICHS and Project Viva included five estimated cell types (omitting granulocytes) <lb/>and all other cohorts included six. When cord blood references became available[28,30,90],, <lb/>a sensitivity analysis was run in ALSPAC adjusting for cell proportions estimated using these <lb/>reference sets. One of these reference sets includes nucleated red blood cells, which can <lb/>contribute greatly to cord blood DNA methylation profiles[28]. <lb/>Methylation measurements and quality control <lb/>Each cohort conducted its own laboratory measurements. DNA from newborn or adolescent <lb/>blood samples underwent bisulfite conversion using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation kit (Zymo <lb/>Research Corporation, Irvine, USA). For all cohorts, DNA methylation was measured using <lb/>the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay[91,92] at Illumina or in <lb/>cohort-specific laboratories. Each cohort also conducted its own quality control and <lb/>normalisation of methylation data, as detailed in the Supplementary Methods (Supplementary <lb/>File S2) and summarised in Supplementary File S1 Table S1. In all analyses, cohorts used <lb/>normalised, untransformed beta-values, which are on a scale of 0 (completely unmethylated) <lb/>to 1 (completely methylated). <lb/>Cohort-specific statistical analyses <lb/>Each cohort performed independent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) according <lb/>to a common, pre-specified analysis plan. Models were run using M-type multiple robust <lb/>linear regression (rlm in the MASS R package[93]) in an attempt to control for potential <lb/>heteroscedasticity and/or influential outliers in the methylation data. In the primary analysis, <lb/>continuous maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy was modelled as the exposure and <lb/>offspring individual CpG-level methylation (untransformed beta-values) was modelled as the <lb/>outcome, with adjustment for covariates and estimated cell counts. In secondary models, we <lb/>modelled the exposure as binary variables comparing WHO BMI categories to a normal <lb/>weight reference group. We also explored the impact of cellular composition by comparing <lb/>models run with and without adjustment for estimated cell counts. <lb/>Meta-analysis <lb/>Cohorts uploaded their EWAS results files to a server at the University of Bristol, where we <lb/>performed fixed-effects meta-analysis weighted by the inverse of the variance with <lb/>METAL[94]. A shadow meta-analyses was also conducted independently by authors at the <lb/>Erasmus University in Rotterdam to minimise the likelihood of human error. All downstream <lb/>analyses were conducted using R version 2.5.1 or later[95]. We excluded control probes <lb/>(N=65), and probes mapped to the X (N=11,232) or Y (N=416) chromosomes. This left a <lb/>total of 473,864 CpGs measured in at least one cohort (218,350 (46%) of these were <lb/>measured in all 19 cohorts, 393,986 (83%) were measured in at least 18 cohorts). Multiple <lb/>testing was accounted for using the Bonferroni method. CpGs with a Bonferroni-corrected P-<lb/>value &lt;0.05, i.e. P&lt;1.06*10 -7 , in both the cell proportion-unadjusted and cell proportion-<lb/>adjusted models were taken forward for further analysis. To assess heterogeneity, we <lb/>generated forest plots, and ran random effects models and &quot;leave-one-out&quot; analyses using the <lb/>metafor R package[96]. We compared our Bonferroni-siginificant probes to a list of <lb/>potentially problematic probes published by Naeem et al. We did not remove these probes as <lb/>this would risk removing potentially interesting effects. However, we tested whether these <lb/>probes contained large numbers of outlying values by performing dip tests s[97] for <lb/>multimodality using the diptest package[34], where a p&gt;0.05 suggests the distribution is <lb/>unimodal. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare the distribution of P-values to <lb/>that expected by chance and were conducted using the core R function ks.test(). <lb/>Enrichment and functional analysis <lb/>Sites were annotated using the IlluminaHumanMethylation450k.db R package[98], with <lb/>enhanced annotation for nearest genes within 10Mb of each site, as previously described[67]. <lb/>These annotations were then updated using the R package mygene[99]. Gene Ontology <lb/>(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were <lb/>performed using the missMethyl R package[100]. This takes into account the differing <lb/>number of sites associated with each gene on the 450k array. P-values for enrichment were <lb/>adjusted for multiple testing using the FDR method. <lb/>Reproduction of maternal BMI-related differential DNA methylation in adolescence <lb/>Four cohorts independently performed robust linear regression to assess the association <lb/>between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and adolescent whole blood DNA <lb/>methylation. Each of these cohorts ran models adjusted for maternal smoking, maternal age, <lb/>socioeconomic status, parity during the index pregnancy and estimated cell counts. Results <lb/>were uploaded to the server at the University of Bristol where they were summarised using <lb/>fixed effects meta-analysis in the metafor package[96]. A look-up of maternal BMI-related <lb/>sites identified in the newborn meta-analysis (n=86 with P&lt;1.06*10 -7 in the cell-adjusted and <lb/>cell-unadjusted models) was performed and FDR correction applied to account for multiple <lb/>testing. These &quot;reproduction&quot; cohorts were completely independent from the original <lb/>&quot;discovery&quot; cohorts. <lb/>Negative control design <lb/>In an attempt to examine a potential causal effect of maternal BMI on newborn blood <lb/>methylation at identified sites, we used a negative control design[7]. In this analysis, <lb/>estimates for associations between maternal BMI and offspring DNA methylation were <lb/>compared to the equivalent estimates for paternal BMI, with adjustment for the other parent&apos;s <lb/>BMI. <lb/>Seven cohorts (ALSPAC, CHAMACOS, Generation R, GOYA, MEDALL [INMA and <lb/>EDEN pooled], NHBCS, RICHS) with the necessary data independently performed robust <lb/>linear regression to assess the association between paternal BMI (kg/m 2 ) and newborn blood <lb/>DNA methylation at sites identified as associated with maternal BMI. Each cohort ran models <lb/>adjusted for maternal smoking, age, socioeconomic status, parity and estimated cell counts. <lb/>We also explored the independent effect of maternal and paternal BMI in mutually adjusted <lb/>models. Results for each of the seven cohorts were uploaded to the server at the University of <lb/>Bristol where they were summarised using fixed effects inverse-variance weighted meta-<lb/>analysis and compared to meta-analysed results of the maternal effect in these seven cohorts. <lb/>The criteria for evidence of an intrauterine effect were, in the mutually adjusted models, 1) <lb/>maternal BMI and paternal BMI show the same direction of association with offspring <lb/>methylation, 2) the magnitude of association with offspring methylation is larger for maternal <lb/>BMI than for paternal BMI, 3) there is evidence of heterogeneity (an I 2 value &gt;40) in a meta-<lb/>analysis of the maternal and paternal mutually-adjusted estimates. We also calculated <lb/>heterogeneity P-values between the mutually adjusted maternal and paternal BMI estimates <lb/>using the metafor R package[96]. <lb/>Identification of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) <lb/>We performed a look-up of maternal BMI-associated methylation sites in an online catalogue <lb/>of both cis-(within 100kb) and trans-methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) identified <lb/>in an ALSPAC study (http://mqtldb.org/)[35]. The meQTLs were identified in cord blood of <lb/>771 children at birth using 395,625 methylation probes and 8,074,398 SNP loci after <lb/>adjustment for sex, the top ten ancestry principal components, bisulfite conversion batch and <lb/>estimated cell counts. A P-value threshold of 1*10 -7 was used to define meQTLs[35]. We <lb/>compared the list of meQTLs to results of an adult BMI GWAS published by the GIANT <lb/>consortium[36,58]. meQTLs were considered nominally associated with BMI if the GWAS <lb/>P-value was &lt;0.05. FDR correction for multiple testing was also performed <lb/></body>

Comparison of estimates of the effect of maternal and paternal BMI on newborn <lb/>DNA methylation. Of the 86 sites where maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy was <lb/>associated with newborn blood methylation, we found 20 sites (plotted here) where the <lb/>estimated effect of maternal BMI, adjusted for paternal BMI, had a P-value&lt;0.05 and was in <lb/>the same direction and greater than the estimated effect of paternal BMI, adjusted for <lb/>maternal BMI.
