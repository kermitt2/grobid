This analysis evalua-<lb/>ted the proportion of patients who achieved &quot;treatment tar-<lb/>gets&quot; with upadacitinib, using a framework encompassing <lb/>multiple criteria including improvements in skin, itch, and <lb/>quality of life. When treated with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 <lb/>mg, over half of patients achieved the targets after 2 weeks <lb/>of treatment, and over three-quarters of patients achieved <lb/>the targets after 1 year of treatment. These findings high-<lb/>light the positive effects of upadacitinib across multiple as-<lb/>pects of patients&apos; lives and may improve standards of care <lb/>for atopic dermatitis. <lb/>A treat-to-target approach was recently developed to <lb/>guide systemic treatment for adults with atopic der-<lb/>matitis (AD). Recommendations outlined criteria for <lb/>a 3-month initial acceptable treatment target and a <lb/>6-month optimal target, evaluated using global as-<lb/>sessment of patient-reported disease severity, as well <lb/>as Eczema Area and Severity Index, itch assessed on <lb/>an 11-point numerical rating scale, Dermatology Life <lb/>Quality Index, or Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure. <lb/>Achievement of these targets with once-daily upada-<lb/>citinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy was evalua-<lb/>ted using integrated adult data from the Measure Up 1 <lb/>and 2 phase 3 studies. Among the 852 patients treated <lb/>with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg, the 3-month initial <lb/>acceptable target was achieved by &gt;80%, &gt;78%, and <lb/>≥87% of patients, and the 6-month optimal target was <lb/>achieved by ≥53%, &gt;61%, and &gt;73% of patients at <lb/>weeks 2, 16, and 52, respectively. Achievement of all 6 <lb/>individual criteria for each of the target goals also in-<lb/>creased over time. These findings suggest that upada-<lb/>citinib 15 mg and 30 mg may help improve standards <lb/>of care in patients with moderate-to-severe AD by ac-<lb/>hieving 6-month target goals at 16 weeks and as early <lb/>as 2 weeks for most patients. <lb/>Key words: atopic dermatitis; itch; Janus kinase inhibitor; skin <lb/>clearance; treat-to-target; upadacitinib. <lb/>Submitted Aug 21, 2024.

        <body>A topic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory <lb/>disease characterized by eczematous lesions and <lb/>intense pruritus, both of which are associated with <lb/>substantial disease burden and impaired health-related <lb/>quality of life (HRQoL) (1, 2). New targeted systemic <lb/>treatments (such as biologic interleukin inhibitors and <lb/>small-molecule oral Janus kinase inhibitors) are currently <lb/>recommended for patients with moderate or severe forms <lb/>of AD whose symptoms are insufficiently controlled <lb/>with standard topical treatments (3, 4). Systemic thera-<lb/>pies have transformed the AD treatment landscape and <lb/>improved the standard of care for patients with moderate-<lb/>to-severe AD; however, uniform agreement is lacking <lb/>regarding optimal AD treatment goals and targets. <lb/>A treat-to-target approach was recently developed <lb/>by de Bruin-Weller et al. (5) to guide shared decision-<lb/>making concerning disease control with systemic therapy <lb/>in adults with AD. This framework includes a patient-<lb/>reported global assessment of overall disease severity, <lb/>as well as assessments made by patients and/or their <lb/>physicians of specific disease domains such as skin <lb/>signs, itch, and HRQoL using established instruments <lb/>(5). Treatment goals include an initial acceptable target <lb/>to be reached within 3 months and an optimal treatment <lb/>target to be reached within 6 months of systemic therapy <lb/>initiation, each defined as improvements in patient-<lb/>reported global severity of disease (&quot;patient domain&quot;) <lb/>plus at least 1 specific disease domain (Fig. 1) (5). This <lb/>treat-to-target framework may be a valuable aid to guide <lb/>AD treatment continuation, modification, and optimiza-<lb/>tion and can guide patients and their healthcare providers <lb/>in setting achievable treatment goals (5). <lb/>Upadacitinib is an oral selective Janus kinase inhibitor <lb/>(6, 7). Upadacitinib demonstrated superior efficacy com-<lb/></body>

        <body>pared with placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe <lb/>AD in 2 phase 3 studies (Measure Up 1 and Measure Up <lb/>2) and is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-seve-<lb/>re AD (8, 9). In this analysis, we used the treat-to-target <lb/>framework and integrated data from the Measure Up 1 <lb/>and Measure Up 2 studies to investigate improvements <lb/>in AD symptoms and quality of life with once-daily oral <lb/>upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) monotherapy in adults <lb/>with moderate-to-severe AD. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Study design, treatment, and patients <lb/>Measure Up 1 (NCT03569293) and Measure Up 2 (NCT03607422) <lb/>are identical, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase <lb/>3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in <lb/>treating patients with moderate-to-severe AD (8, 10). Enrolment <lb/>criteria for the Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 studies have been <lb/>reported; in brief, eligible patients were adolescents (aged 12-17 <lb/>years, weight ≥ 40 kg) or adults (aged 18-75 years) who had AD <lb/>symptoms for ≥ 3 years, were candidates for systemic therapy, <lb/>and had moderate-to-severe AD at screening (defined as Eczema <lb/>Area and Severity Index [EASI] scores ≥ 16, validated Investigator <lb/>Global Assessment for AD [vIGA-AD] scores ≥ 3, rolling average <lb/>of Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [WP-NRS] scores ≥ 4, <lb/>and ≥ 10% of body surface area affected) (8). Eligible patients were <lb/>randomized 1:1:1 to receive daily, orally administered upadacitinib <lb/>15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, or placebo from baseline to week 16 (8). <lb/>At week 16, patients randomized to placebo were re-randomized 1:1 <lb/>to upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg; all patients continued <lb/>blinded upadacitinib treatment to week 260 (8, 10). <lb/>The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol; <lb/>International Council for Harmonisation guidelines; and appli-<lb/>cable regulations, guidelines, and ethical principles originating <lb/>from the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written <lb/>informed consent. <lb/>Assessments and target criteria <lb/>Patient-reported global severity of disease was assessed using <lb/>the Patient Global Impression of Severity 5-point scale (PGIS-5; <lb/>0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe). PGIS-5 <lb/>is derived from the 7-point PGIS scale (Table SI) (11). Five disease <lb/>domains were used to assess AD signs and symptom severity <lb/>and HRQoL: EASI, SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), <lb/>WP-NRS, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Patient-<lb/>Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). <lb/>This analysis included patients from the Measure Up 1 and <lb/>Measure Up 2 studies who met the following inclusion criteria <lb/>at baseline: age ≥18 years, PGIS-5&gt;2 (i.e., moderate or severe), <lb/>EASI&gt;7, SCORAD&gt;24, WP-NRS&gt;4, DLQI&gt;5, and POEM&gt;7. <lb/>Integrated patient data from the Measure Up 1 and Measure <lb/>Up 2 studies were used to evaluate the proportion of patients <lb/>who achieved the 3-month initial acceptable target goal and the <lb/>6-month optimal target goal at weeks 2, 16, and 52 (time points <lb/>at which all assessments were collected during the Measure Up <lb/>1 and 2 studies). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Data are reported as observed cases based on non-missing mea-<lb/>surements at the time patients were receiving the study drug; sta-<lb/>tistical comparisons between upadacitinib and placebo were not <lb/>performed for observed cases data. Analyses were conducted at <lb/>time points at which all patient and disease domain assessments <lb/>were conducted in the Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 studies <lb/>(weeks 2, 16, and 52). For statistical comparisons of upadacitinib <lb/>vs placebo (weeks 2 and 16), missing data were imputed using non-<lb/>responder imputation with no special handling for data missing <lb/>owing to COVID-19 (NRI-NC). P-values and 95% confidence <lb/>intervals for the adjusted difference were calculated according to <lb/>Fig. 1.

        <body>the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for strata (study and <lb/>baseline vIGA-AD). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Patients <lb/>Overall, this analysis included 1,282 adults (upadacitinib <lb/>30 mg, n = 424; upadacitinib 15 mg, n = 428; placebo, <lb/>n = 430). Baseline demographics and disease characte-<lb/>ristics were generally well balanced across treatment <lb/>groups (Table I). Patients&apos; mean (SD) age was 36.3 (14.5) <lb/>years; 44.5% of patients were female; and most patients <lb/>(66.2%) were White. At baseline, the mean (SD) EASI <lb/>score was 29.6 (12.1); 52.0% of patients had a vIGA-AD <lb/>score of 4 (severe); and the mean (SD) WP-NRS score <lb/>was 7.4 (1.5). <lb/>Achievement of the 3-month initial acceptable target goal <lb/>More than 78% of patients treated with either dose of <lb/>upadacitinib achieved the 3-month initial acceptable tar-<lb/>get goal as early as week 2, with similar results observed <lb/>at week 16 and week 52; a substantially higher propor-<lb/>tion of patients achieved the 3-month initial acceptable <lb/>target goal with upadacitinib than with placebo (Fig. 2A). <lb/>More than 24% of patients who received upadacitinib <lb/>achieved all 6 of the individual criteria for the 3-month <lb/>initial acceptable target goal as early as week 2, and <lb/>over 51% of patients achieved all 6 individual criteria <lb/>at weeks 16 and 52 (Fig. 2B). Results were generally <lb/>consistent using NRI-NC methodology; more patients <lb/>achieved the 3-month initial acceptable target goal with <lb/>upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg than with placebo at weeks <lb/>2 and 16 (nominal p &lt; 0.001; Fig. S1). When considering <lb/>the full distribution of patient responses for the 3-month <lb/>initial acceptable target goal, the proportion of patients <lb/>achieving a higher number of individual target criteria <lb/>increased over time; response rates were substantially <lb/>higher with upadacitinib than with placebo (Fig. 3). <lb/>Among subgroups of patients who achieved the 3-month <lb/>patient domain target (≥ 1-point improvement in PGIS-5) <lb/>and ≥ 1 or exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 individual 3-month target <lb/>Fig. 2.

S2-S6. <lb/>Achievement of the 6-month optimal target goal <lb/>Overall, results for the 6-month optimal target goal fol-<lb/>lowed similar patterns to those observed for the 3-month <lb/>initial acceptable target goal. At week 52, over 73% of <lb/>patients who received upadacitinib achieved the 6-month <lb/>optimal target goal (Fig. 4A) and over 45% achieved all <lb/>6 of the 6-month individual criteria (Fig. 4B). At weeks <lb/>2 and 16, using NRI-NC, more patients achieved the <lb/>6-month optimal target goal with upadacitinib 15 mg or <lb/>30 mg than with placebo (nominal p &lt; 0.001; Fig. S7). <lb/>Similar to the 3-month initial acceptable target goal fin-<lb/>dings, the number of individual 6-month target criteria <lb/>achieved by patients increased over time when looking <lb/>across the full distribution of responses, and response <lb/>rates were substantially higher with upadacitinib than <lb/>with placebo (Fig. 5). Among subgroups of patients <lb/>who achieved the 6-month patient domain target (PGIS-<lb/>5 score ≤ 2) and ≥ 1 or exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 individual <lb/>6-month target components, the proportion of patients <lb/>who achieved specific individual 6-month target com-<lb/>ponents is presented in Figs.

Overall, the 3-month initial <lb/>acceptable target goal and the 6-month optimal target <lb/>goal were achieved with upadacitinib by most patients <lb/>at the time points studied.

        <body>tion of patients achieved the 3-month and 6-month target <lb/>goals with upadacitinib 30 mg than with upadacitinib 15 <lb/>mg, a dose-dependent pattern consistent with previous <lb/>upadacitinib studies (8, 10). <lb/>Patients rapidly achieved the treatment goals with <lb/>upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg: most achieved the 3-month <lb/>initial acceptable target goal and the more stringent <lb/>6-month optimal target goal at week 2, with consistent <lb/>or improved achievement at weeks 16 and 52. Conside-<lb/>ring how quickly many patients achieved the 3-month <lb/>and 6-month targets with upadacitinib therapy, these <lb/>findings suggest that goal targets for AD may need to <lb/>be re-evaluated as new treatments with improved and <lb/>rapid efficacy become available and standards of care <lb/>become elevated. Indeed, evolution and flexibility of <lb/>the treat-to-target consensus criteria have been proposed <lb/>to adapt to the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for <lb/>AD or to account for limitations of different healthcare <lb/>systems (12, 13). <lb/>Overall, the 3-month initial acceptable target goal <lb/>and the 6-month optimal target goal were achieved by <lb/>more than half of patients as early as week 2 and by <lb/>three-quarters of patients at week 52. The proportion <lb/>of patients achieving all 6 individual treatment targets <lb/>also increased over time. As early as week 2, 24-37% <lb/>of patients achieved all 6 individual 3-month targets and <lb/>9-16% of patients achieved all 6 individual 6-month <lb/>targets. At week 52, approximately two-thirds of patients <lb/>achieved all 6 individual 3-month targets and roughly <lb/>half achieved all 6 individual 6-month targets. These <lb/>findings highlight the compelling breadth of effects as-<lb/>sociated with upadacitinib therapy. <lb/>Numerous systemic therapies for AD have been deve-<lb/>loped and approved in recent years; however, no consen-<lb/>sus exists on criteria for treatment selection and treatment <lb/>success. Furthermore, factors guiding treatment decisions <lb/>may be complex, and clinical assessments of treatment <lb/>benefits may be subjective. The treat-to-target framework <lb/>was designed to guide clinicians administering syste-<lb/>mic therapies in various clinical settings and in diverse <lb/>patient populations. Evaluation of prespecified target <lb/>criteria provides a valuable tool to monitor treatment <lb/>response across multiple dimensions and inform shared <lb/>decision-making between patients and healthcare pro-<lb/>viders as appropriate treatments are selected to achieve <lb/>optimal outcomes. Findings from this analysis highlight <lb/>the importance of evaluating and controlling multiple <lb/>dimensions of AD (including patient-reported outcomes <lb/>in addition to clinician-reported outcomes) in impacting <lb/>treatment selection, guiding individualized treatment <lb/>plans, and optimizing patient care and outcomes. <lb/>The results reported herein are generally consistent <lb/>with those in another treat-to-target analysis of a se-<lb/>lective Janus kinase inhibitor, abrocitinib (14), which <lb/>demonstrates the utility of this approach to evaluate the <lb/>efficacy of various systemic AD treatments and optimize <lb/>outcomes. Generally, a numerically higher proportion of <lb/>patients achieved the individual 3-month and 6-month <lb/>target components with upadacitinib treatment at week <lb/>16 than did patients receiving abrocitinib treatment at <lb/>week 12 (although results for abrocitinib at week 16 <lb/>have not been reported to date) (14). Here we also re-<lb/>port the short-term (2-week) and long-term (52-week) <lb/>achievement of 3-month and 6-month target goals with <lb/>upadacitinib therapy, in addition to the proportion of <lb/>patients achieving all 6 individual components of the <lb/>3-month and 6-month target goals; to our knowledge, <lb/>this is the first such report for any systemic AD therapy. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>There are a few limitations of this study. One limitation <lb/>is a restriction to time points during the Measure Up 1 <lb/>and 2 studies when all assessments were conducted; the-<lb/>refore, whether these targets were met before week 2 and <lb/>the nature of the dynamics between weeks 16 and 52 are <lb/>not known. Additionally, findings from this clinical trial <lb/>population may not be generalizable to the real-world <lb/>population of patients with AD seen in the clinic. The <lb/>assessments needed to gauge the achievement of treat-to-<lb/>target criteria may not be comprehensively evaluated and <lb/>fully integrated into clinical practice owing to variables <lb/>such as short clinic visits and clinician preferences for <lb/>specific tools; thus, there may be an increased need to <lb/>implement these assessments so that healthcare providers <lb/>can determine whether targets are being met. In addi-<lb/>tion, these findings may not fully represent treatment <lb/>benefits experienced by patients; current treat-to-target <lb/>goals only reflect &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;optimal&quot; targets, but <lb/>partial improvements in clinical and/or HRQoL outco-<lb/>mes that do not meet the treat-to-target criteria may still <lb/>be meaningful to patients, especially when considering <lb/>their disease history and journey. Current treat-to-target <lb/>criteria do not include direct input from patients regar-<lb/>ding their most bothersome symptoms; thus, additional <lb/>tailoring and shared decision-making between patients <lb/>and physicians may be needed to meet individualized <lb/>treatment goals. <lb/>Conlusion <lb/>Upadacitinib 15-mg or 30-mg treatment led to rapid and <lb/>durable improvements in AD symptoms and quality of <lb/>life based on an evidence-based, treat-to-target approach, <lb/>which may inform shared decision-making between <lb/>patients and their healthcare providers and improve <lb/>standards of care for AD. <lb/></body>
