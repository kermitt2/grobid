			<body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved in <lb/>diverse physiological functions including thermosensation <lb/>and chemosensation. [1,2] The mammalian TRP superfamily is <lb/>composed of 28 members that are grouped into six subfam-<lb/>ilies based on their amino acid sequence homology: TRPC <lb/>(canonical or classic), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melasta-<lb/>tin), TRPA (ankyrin), TRPP (polycystin) and TRPML (mu-<lb/>colipin). [3] TRPM2, a subtype of TRP-melastatin subfamily <lb/>(TRPM), is a multifunctional Ca 2+ permeable and nonselec-<lb/>tive cation channel. [4] It functions as an important Ca 2+ sig-<lb/>nalling regulator in a variety of cells, contributing to cellular <lb/>functions including cytokine production, insulin release, cell <lb/></body>

			<body>motility, oxidative stress and cell death. [5] TRPM2 is activated <lb/>by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen perox-<lb/>ide and is considered as a chanzyme containing a unique C-<lb/>terminal Nudix hydrolase domain, that is homologous to the <lb/>ADPR pyrophosphatase nudix hydrolase 9 (NUDT9). [6-8] <lb/>The NUDT9-homology (NUDT9-H) domain serves a binding <lb/>site for channel activation by adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose <lb/>(ADPR). [6] Accumulating evidence shows that TRPM2 <lb/>channel plays a critical role in sensing internal body tem-<lb/>perature [9-11] and is also implicated in many pathological <lb/>processes such as neurodegeneration, [12,13] diabetes [14,15] and <lb/>ischemic reperfusion injury, [16,17] suggesting TRPM2 as a po-<lb/>tential therapeutic target. Therefore, inhibiting TRPM2 may <lb/>lead to a therapeutic potential for ischemicinjury. <lb/>In the past, several small molecules (Figure 1) have been <lb/>reported to show TRPM2 inhibitory activity with variable <lb/>IC 50 (1.2~76 μm), including flufenamic acid (FFA), [18,19] <lb/>2-(3-methylphenyl) aminobenzoic acid (3-MFA), [19] N-(p-<lb/>amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA), [20] econazole, clotri-<lb/>mazole [21] and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). [22,23] <lb/>However, none of them show any specificity against TRPM2 <lb/>channel. [24] For instance, 2-APB activates TRPV1, TRPV2 <lb/>and TRPV3. [25] In addition, several nucleotide analogues such <lb/>as adenosine monophosphate (AMP), 8-bromoadenosine <lb/>5′-diphosphoribose (8-Br-ADPR) have also been reported to be <lb/>TRPM2 inhibitors (Figure 1). [26,27] Recently, a series of ADPR <lb/>analogues mainly modified at C-8 position of purine such as <lb/>8-phenyl-2′-deoxy-ADPR (Figure 1) have been shown to po-<lb/>tently inhibit TRPM2 current (IC 50 = 3 μm) without interfering <lb/>Ca 2+ release induced by cADPR, NAADP or IP 3 . [28] Despite <lb/>the efforts in searching for TRPM2 inhibitors, no TRP-subtype <lb/>selective TRPM2 inhibitor has yet been identified. Therefore, it <lb/>is critical to discover novel selective inhibitors of TRPM2 that <lb/>can be used to further investigate TRPM2 channel function and <lb/>validate the channel as a therapeutic target. <lb/>Substitution of pyrophosphate linkage oxygen of ADPR <lb/>has rarely been investigated. Xu et al. [29] introduced a meth-<lb/>ylenebisphosphonate linkage to cADPR and found that the <lb/>activity of cADPR is very sensitive to the modifications in the <lb/>pyrophosphate moiety, indicating that pyrophosphate moiety <lb/>contributes to cADPR binding on its receptor. Considering the <lb/>homology of cADPR and ADPR, we, in this study, synthe-<lb/>sized a new series of ADPR analogues (Figure 2) by integrat-<lb/>ing the modifications of pyrophosphate linkage and adenosine, <lb/>in which the pyrophosphate linkage was replaced by meth-<lb/>ylenebisphosphate or difluoromethylenebisphosphate. The <lb/>activity of all synthesized individual ADPR analogues was <lb/>assessed. Their selectivity against other TRP channels includ-<lb/>ing TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 and TRPV3 was also evaluated. <lb/>Two novel TRPM2 inhibitors, 7i and 8a, were identified in <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Structures of TRPM2 inhibitors from reported literatures <lb/></body>

			<body>this study, and both compounds can be primarily used to probe <lb/>physiological and pharmacological functions of TRPM2 chan-<lb/>nel, and their potency can also be further improved. <lb/>2 | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>2.1 | Chemistry <lb/>All commercial chemicals and solvents were purchased from <lb/>commercial suppliers of analytical grade and used without <lb/>further purification. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded <lb/>on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts <lb/>were reported as values from an internal tetramethylsilane <lb/>standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were re-<lb/>corded on a Bruker Apex IV FTMS. LC/MS analyses were <lb/>performed on an Agilent 1200-6110 instruments. Silica <lb/>gel (200~300 mesh) was used for chromatography. HPLC <lb/>(Gilson, France) was used to purify the protected and the <lb/>final deprotected ADPR analogues, whereby a C18 reversed-<lb/>phase column (Venusil XBP C18-2, 21.5 mm×250 mm, <lb/>10 μm, Agela Technologies, Beijing, China) was employed. <lb/>Generally, the synthesis of ADPR analogues could be di-<lb/>vided into two routes (Figure 3). One was adenosine diphosphate <lb/>(ADP) coupled with 5-tosyl ribose (Figure 3), in which ADP ana-<lb/>logues were originally synthesized from C-2 position substituted <lb/>adenosines and 5-tosyl ribose was originally synthesized from <lb/>D-ribose. The other one was 5′-tosyl nucleoside coupled with ri-<lb/>bose diphosphate (RDP) (Figure 3), in which 5-tosyl adenosines <lb/>were originally synthesized from C-2 position substituted ade-<lb/>nosine and RDP analogues were originally synthesized from D-<lb/>ribose. Protected ADPR analogues were synthesized employing <lb/>above synthetic route and were further deprotected with aqueous <lb/>HCl and purified by HPLC to give the final ADPR analogues. <lb/>Detailed characterization data by 1 H, 13 C NMR, MS and HRMS <lb/>for all compounds are available in Supporting information. <lb/>2.1.1 | Synthetic route 1 and general <lb/>procedures <lb/>2′,3′-O-Isopropylidene-5′-O-tosyl adenosine 2a was <lb/>prepared with similar procedures according to the <lb/>references. [30,31] Compound 2a (0.65 g, 1.4 mmol) and <lb/>tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) hydrogen methylenediphos-<lb/>phonate (1.60 g, 1.8 mmol) were mixed with 3 ml dry <lb/>CH 3 CN and stirred at room temperature for 16 hr. The sol-<lb/>vent was evaporated, diluted with H 2 O and eluted through <lb/>a column of Amberlyst A15 resin (NH 4 <lb/>+ form). The eluant <lb/>was concentrated to dryness. The residue was separated on <lb/>silica gel chromatography (iPrOH:H 2 O:aq NH 3 = 8:1:1 to <lb/>6:2:2) to give the ammonium salt of 2′,3′-O-isopropyliden <lb/>e-5′-methylenediphosphate adenosine 3a as a light yellow <lb/>foam solid (0.52 g, yield: 67%). Compound 3a (520 mg, <lb/>1.0 mmol) was treated with tetrabutylammonium hydrox-<lb/>ide (40%wt in water, 1.94 ml, 3.0 mmol) and lyophilized. <lb/>Then 1-O-methyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-O-tosyl ribose 5 <lb/>and 1 ml dry CH 3 CN were added and stirred at room tem-<lb/>perature for 48 hr. The solvent was evaporated, diluted <lb/>with H 2 O and eluted through a column of Amberlyst A15 <lb/>resin (NH 4 <lb/>+ form). The eluant was concentrated to dryness. <lb/>The residue was separated on silica gel chromatography <lb/>(iPrOH:H 2 O:aq NH 3 = 16:1:1 to 8:1:1), followed by fur-<lb/>ther purification with HPLC (H 2 O:CH 3 CN = 9:1 to 1:1) to <lb/>give the ammonium salt of 1″-O-methyl-2″,2′,3″,3′-O-iso <lb/>propylidene-5′-methylenediphoribose adenosine 7a (pro-<lb/>tected CH 2 ADPR) as a white foam solid (140 mg, yield: <lb/>20%).

Human TRPM7 (NCBI Reference Sequence: <lb/>NM_001301212.1, in pcDNA5/TO vector), TRPM8 (NCBI <lb/>Reference Sequence: NM_024080.4, in pcDNA4/TO vec-<lb/>tor), TRPV1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_080704.3, in <lb/>pcDNA4/TO vector) and TRPV3 (NCBI Reference Sequence: <lb/>NM_001258205.1, in pcMV6/TO vector) were transfected into <lb/>HEK-293 T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24~48 hr be-<lb/>fore recordings. HEK293 T cells were cultured at 37°C under <lb/>5% CO 2 in DMEM medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% <lb/>foetal calf serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ <lb/>ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded on coverslips before use. <lb/>2.2.2 | Western blot <lb/>Western blot was conducted as previously described. [34] In brief, <lb/>after transfection for 24-36 hr, HEK293 cells were rinsed with <lb/>ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold protein lysis buffer (RIPA <lb/>buffer, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) for 30 min. <lb/>After centrifuging the lysates at 20,817 g at 4°C for 10 min, the <lb/>supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C until use. The <lb/>protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein <lb/>assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Thirty <lb/>to fifty micrograms of protein/lane was diluted in standard SDS <lb/>sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-<lb/>polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to polyvi-<lb/>nylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA), blocked with <lb/>5% BSA (Sangon Biotech, China) in Tris-buffered saline con-<lb/>taining 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 hr at room temperature <lb/>and incubated with the primary antibody (TRPM2: Ab11168, <lb/>Abcam, UK) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then <lb/>washed with TBST and incubated with the secondary antibody <lb/>(goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP: 31420, Thermo Fisher Scientific, <lb/>USA). Protein bands were visualized using an Odyssey Infrared <lb/>Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, USA). Quantity One soft-<lb/>ware (BioRad, USA) was used for densitometric scanning. <lb/>2.2.3 | Electrophysiology <lb/>Patch-clamp recordings were performed in whole-cell con-<lb/>figuration at room temperature using Axonpatch 200B (Axon, <lb/>USA) or HEKA EPC10 (HEKA, Germany) amplifier. Similar <lb/>to our previously reported protocol, [34] cells were kept in extra-<lb/>cellular solution (ECS) containing (in mm): 147 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 <lb/>MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 13 glucose, pH 7.4. Electrodes <lb/>had a final resistance of 3-5 MΩ when filled with intracellu-<lb/>lar solution (ICS) containing (in mm): 147 NaCl, 0.05 EGTA, <lb/>1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 0.1 ADPR, pH 7.3. Patch pipettes <lb/>(2-4 MΩ) were prepared from the Narishige PC-10 puller <lb/>(Narishige, Japan) with Borosilicate glass (Sutter, USA). <lb/>Test compound was added to either ECS or ICS with a <lb/>concentration of 0.1 mm, to determine the extracellular or in-<lb/>tracellular effect of test compound on TRPM2. The ADPR <lb/>concentration was fixed at 0.1 mm in the ICS that also con-<lb/>tains test compound when tested for intracellular effect. ECS <lb/>with compound was perfused for at least 60 s before switch-<lb/>ing to acidic ECS (pH 5.0) that blocks TRPM2 current. <lb/>Change of extracellular solution was achieved using an <lb/>RSC-160 system (Biologic Science Instruments, France) in <lb/>which the solution changing time was about 300 ms. Cell <lb/>was held at 0 mV. Voltage ramps with 500 ms duration from <lb/>-100 to 100 mV were applied every 5 s. Data were acquired <lb/>at 10 kHz and filtered offline at 50 Hz. Capacitive currents <lb/>and series resistance were determined and corrected before <lb/>each voltage ramp. For analysis, the mean of the first three <lb/>ramps before channel activation was used for leak-subtraction <lb/>of all subsequent current recordings. <lb/>For selectivity evaluation, test compound (0.1 mm) was <lb/>added to the intracellular solution (ICS) to determine intra-<lb/>cellular effect of compound on individual TRPM7, TRPM8, <lb/>TRPV1 and TRPV3, respectively. <lb/>For recordings of TRPM7 channels, the extracellular solution <lb/>(ECS) contains (in mm): 145 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 5 KCl, 10 <lb/>D-glucose, 10 HEPES.

The ICS con-<lb/>tains (in mm): 115 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 5.7 <lb/>CaCl 2 , pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, osmolarity was ad-<lb/>justed to ~290 mOsm with mannitol, and the calculated free Ca 2+ <lb/>was 200 nm. Menthol (1 mm) was added in the ECS to activate <lb/>TRPM8, and 2-APB (0.1 mm) was added in the ECS to inhibit <lb/>TRPM8. Capsaicin (0.01 mm) and ruthenium red (0.1 mm) were <lb/>added in the ECS to activate and inhibit TRPV1, respectively. <lb/>For TRPV3 recordings, both ECS and ICS contained <lb/>130 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA. 0.1 mm 2-APB in the ECS was <lb/>used to activate TRPV3 and was washed out with standard ECS. <lb/>2.3 | Data analysis <lb/>All results from patch-clamp recordings were ex-<lb/>pressed as mean ± SEM, with n indicating the number <lb/></body>

Taken together, in this study, a more ef-<lb/>ficient way for synthesis of ADPR analogues was developed. <lb/>3.2 | Intracellular, but not extracellular, <lb/>inhibition of TRPM2 by two novel ADPR <lb/>analogues 7i and 8a <lb/>To screen for TRPM2 inhibitors, the effects of all synthe-<lb/>sized ADPR analogues (Table 1) were evaluated on TRPM2 <lb/>channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells by whole-cell <lb/>patch-clamp recordings. In HEK293 cells, the expression of <lb/>TRPM2 channel proteins was detected by Western blot anal-<lb/>ysis (Figure 4a). It is known that TRPM2 is only activated <lb/>by intracellular ADPR that binds directly to TRPM2 chan-<lb/>nel&apos;s enzymatic NUDT9-H domain in the C-terminal tail. [6] <lb/>We tested whether extracellular administration of individual <lb/>ADPR analogues had any effect on TRPM2 currents (Table <lb/>S1). When administered extracellularly (100 μm), none of <lb/>the synthesized ADPR analogues showed any inhibition on <lb/>TRPM2 currents induced by intracellular ADPR, in which <lb/>compounds 7i and 8a serving as representatives (Figure 4b). <lb/>In contrast, intracellular administration of 7i or 8a at 3 μm <lb/>resulted in a reduction of TRPM2 current by 39% and 36%, <lb/>respectively, as compared with 100 μm ADPR as a control <lb/>(Figure 4c-e, p &lt; .005). Applying different concentrations of <lb/>7i or 8a gave rise to a dose-dependent inhibition of TRPM2 <lb/>current with IC 50 s for 7i at 5.7 μm and 8a at 5.4 μm (Figure 4f). <lb/>These results suggest compounds 7i and 8a inhibited TRPM2 <lb/>intracellularly, possibly through competing with ADPR by <lb/>binding to the intracellular NUDT9-H domain. <lb/>3.3 | Lack of inhibitory effect on other TRP <lb/>channels by compound 7i or 8a <lb/>To evaluate the compounds selectivity, the effects of both <lb/>7i and 8a on other TRP channels, including the closely re-<lb/>lated channels TRPM7 and TRPM8, and the more distantly <lb/>related channels TRPV1 and TRPV3, were tested. TRPM7 <lb/>currents overexpressed in HEK293T cells were activated by <lb/>low concentrations of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (both in 0.1 mm) in <lb/>the extracellular solution (ECS). Compared with the control <lb/>without 7i (Figure 5k), the intracellular administration of 7i <lb/>(100 μm) showed no effect on TRPM7 currents (Figure 5a). <lb/>Similarly, adding 100 μm 7i compound in the pipette did not <lb/>affect TRPM8 pharmacology in response to either activator, <lb/>menthol (1 mm) or blocker 2-APB (100 μm) (Figure 5b,l). <lb/>Adding compound 7i (100 μm) in the pipette had no effect on <lb/>activating TRPV1 induced by capsaicin, although appeared <lb/>to delay the channel activation (Figure 5c,m). The intracel-<lb/>lular effect of compound 7i on TRPV3 was also tested. As <lb/>shown in Figure 5d,n, application of compound 7i (100 μm) in <lb/>pipette had no effect on TRPV3 currents activated by 100 μm <lb/>S C H E M E 3 Reagents and conditions: (i) methyl p-toluenesulphonate, KOH, DMF, rt, 12 hr; then Py, TsCl, rt, 24 hr; (ii) tris (tetra-n-<lb/>butylammonium) hydrogen methylene phosphate, dry CH 3 CN, rt, 16 hr; (iii) 2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-O-tosyl ribose 5, dry CH 3 CN, rt, 48 hr; (iv) <lb/>0.8 N HCl, 0°C, 8 hr <lb/></body>

			<body>2-APB. These results show that intracellular compound 7i has <lb/>no inhibitory effect on TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 and TRPV3 <lb/>(Figure 5a-e). <lb/>Similarly, the effects of compound 8a on TRPM7, TRPM8, <lb/>TRPV1 and TRPV3 were also tested. Intracellular administra-<lb/>tions of compound 8a (100 μm) did not show any inhibitory ef-<lb/>fect on these TRP channels (Figure 5f-j,k-n). Taken together, <lb/>these results indicate that compounds 7i and 8a are specific in in-<lb/>hibiting TRPM2 channel without affecting other TRP channels. <lb/>3.4 | Structure-activity relationship <lb/>(SAR) of synthesized ADPR analogues for <lb/>TRPM2 inhibition <lb/>Totally, 39 compounds were synthesized to explore the structure-<lb/>activity relationship (SAR) of the ADPR analogues (Figure 6). <lb/>To begin with adenosine modification, ADPR analogues (7h, <lb/>7g, 10h, 10g) with 6-methylamino or 6-dimethylamino substi-<lb/>tution showed no inhibitory activity, indicating the necessity <lb/>of 6-amino for inhibitory activity. This is in accordance with <lb/>Moreau&apos;s report, in which 6-oxygen substituted ADPR (IDPR) <lb/>shows no inhibitory activity. [28] Substitutions at C-2 position <lb/>of purine base showed different influences. Compounds 7i <lb/>(2-chloro) and 8a (2-hydrogen) exhibited moderate activity, <lb/>while other substitutions such as 2-bromo, 2-iodo, 2-amino and <lb/>2-methoxy (7a~7e, 7h, 7j~7o, 10a~10o) did not. Thus, more <lb/>kinds of substitutions should be investigated to further reveal the <lb/>effect of C-2 position modification on inhibitory activity, which <lb/>may lead to novel potent inhibitors. As to adenosine ribose part, <lb/>neither compound 13 nor compound 14 with 2′-methoxy substi-<lb/>tution showed any inhibitory activity indicating the importance <lb/>of C-2′ position for analogues binding. <lb/>F I G U R E 4 The concentration-dependent inhibition of TRPM2 by compounds 7i and 8a.

			<body>With regard to pyrophosphate, both two active com-<lb/>pounds 7i and 8a possess a substituted pyrophosphate <lb/>(O → CH 2 or CF 2 ). In contrast, inactive compound 7o re-<lb/>serves oxygen-linked pyrophosphate. Previous report consid-<lb/>ered pyrophosphate as an activity-keeping group and none <lb/>of the sulphonamide, squarate or triazole substituted ADPR <lb/>analogues showed any activity. [28] Therefore, appropriate <lb/>modifications on the pyrophosphate can be tolerable. <lb/>As to the terminal ribose, it has been shown that a five-<lb/>membered ring but the hydroxyl groups of the terminal ribose <lb/>plays a critical role in filling the binding site. [28] Here, compounds <lb/>7i and 8a (both terminal ribose hydroxyl protected) showed in-<lb/>hibitory activity, while their corresponding deprotected products <lb/>10i and 10a lost inhibitory activity. Taken together, we suppose, <lb/>applying saturated ring mimicking essential terminal ribose is <lb/>feasible, which may improve the inhibitory activity. <lb/>4 | DISCUSSION <lb/>Searching for selective TRPM2 inhibitors as tool molecules is <lb/>critical for probing pharmacological functions of the channel. <lb/>Up to date, there are non-specific TRPM2 inhibitors such as <lb/>2-APB, clotrimazole and FFA. These inhibitors exhibit low <lb/>potency on TRPM2 channel and also are lack of selectivity <lb/>on other TRP channels. Moreau et al. previously reported <lb/>several ADPR analogues as specific TRPM2 inhibitors with-<lb/>out interfering Ca 2+ release induced by cADPR, NAADP or <lb/>IP 3 . [28] However, the selectivity of these analogues against <lb/>other TRP channels remains unclear. <lb/>To discover novel TRPM2 selective inhibitors, we sys-<lb/>tematically synthesized a new series of ADPR analogues <lb/>(Schemes 1-3) in this study. Modifications were mainly fo-<lb/>cused on pyrophosphate linkage and adenosine, to improve <lb/>the potency and membrane permeability. Two major routes <lb/>were employed for ADPR analogue synthesis (Figure 3). <lb/>Both synthetic routes are relative simple, of which ADP <lb/>analogues and RDP analogues were the key intermediates <lb/>(Schemes 1-3). These two key intermediates were obtained <lb/>in moderate yield (50%~70%) and can be employed for ADPR <lb/>analogues derivatization easily. Compared with previous re-<lb/>port of which ADPR analogues are synthesized through quite <lb/>a number of individual synthetic routes, [28] a more efficient <lb/>way for synthesis of ADPR analogues was developed in this <lb/>F I G U R E 5 Selectivity evaluations of intracellular 100 μm 7i (a-d, n = 3) or 100 μm 8a (f-i, n = 3) in the pipette on other TRP channels <lb/>(TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1, TRPV3).

			<body>study, though esterification and deprotection steps give the <lb/>desired products (protected ADPR analogues and ADPR an-<lb/>alogues) in low yield. <lb/>Totally 39 new ADPR analogues were synthesized. <lb/>Compounds 7i and 8a were confirmed as TRPM2 inhibi-<lb/>tors with moderate activity, exerting intracellular inhibition <lb/>of TRPM2 current, and demonstrating selectivity over other <lb/>TRP members including TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 and <lb/>TRPV3. The characters of these two inhibitors probably at-<lb/>tribute to the nature of ADPR analogues. It is well known <lb/>that ADPR gates TRPM2 through binding to the cytosolic <lb/>C-terminal NUDT9-H domain which is a unique structure <lb/>domain among TRP channels. [5] The two inhibitors 7i and <lb/>8a likely compete with ADPR for binding to the NUDT9-H <lb/>domain, serving as intracellular inhibitors. These two new in-<lb/>hibitors are firstly identified TRP-subtype selective TRPM2 <lb/>inhibitors, which are selective over TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 <lb/>and TRPV3, providing new tool molecules for probing phar-<lb/>macological functions of TRPM2 channel. Previous reported <lb/>nonselective inhibitors such as FFA and 2-APB also show <lb/>significant effects on other ion channels. FFA can also inhibit <lb/>TRPM3, TRPM4 and TRPM5, [35,36] while 2-APB also acti-<lb/>vates TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPV3. [25] When employing se-<lb/>lective inhibitors 7i or 8a on probing TRPM2 function, these <lb/>unwanted side-effects will be eliminated, so that the results <lb/>will be more relevant to TRPM2 channel. Though the two <lb/>inhibitors still exhibit poor membrane permeability limiting <lb/>their extracellular application in probing TRPM2 function, <lb/>applying liposomes or nucleotide prodrug technique will <lb/>allow the transport of 7i or 8a across the membrane. These <lb/>newly identified TRP-subtype selective inhibitors can serve <lb/>as new pharmacological tools for probing TRPM2 channel. <lb/>What is more, the identification of ADPR-analogue-<lb/>based TRPM2 inhibitors provides further insights into <lb/>optimizing potency and membrane permeability. With <lb/>regarding to improving membrane permeability, none of <lb/>the ADPR analogues show any inhibitory activity when <lb/>administered extracellularly; thus, it is still insufficient <lb/>though substituting pyrophosphate oxygen with methylene <lb/>or difluoromethylene. Recently, a neutral triazole substi-<lb/>tuted cADPR (P 2 O 6 <lb/>-→ triazole) that retains its ability to <lb/>activate Ca 2+ release was reported by Swarbrick et al. [37] <lb/>This encourages employing more kinds of neutral substi-<lb/>tutes, though the pyrophosphate group seems critical for <lb/>keeping the activity. For potency optimizing, more kinds of <lb/>substitutions at C-2 position should be investigated, which <lb/>may lead to novel potent inhibitors. Other successful cases <lb/>that took purine C-2 position substitution support this <lb/>hypothesis. Fischer et al. reported 2-chloro-adenosine-5′-<lb/>O-α-boranodiphosphate (2-Cl-α-BH 3 -ADP) as a potent ag-<lb/>onist (EC 50 = 7 nm) of P2Y1 receptor, whose endogenous <lb/>substrate is adenosine diphosphate (ADP). [38] Similarly, <lb/>2-methylthio-AMP was reported as an inhibitor of P2Y12 <lb/>receptor, for which ADP serves as the endogenous sub-<lb/>strate as well. [39,40] As far as to terminal ribose, neither <lb/>ribose nor isopropylidene-protected ribose determines the <lb/>inhibitory activity, thus employing more kinds of rings is <lb/>an alternative way. <lb/>5 | CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Searching for selective TRPM2 inhibitors as tool molecules <lb/>is critical for probing pharmacological functions of the chan-<lb/>nel. In this study, we synthesized 39 new ADPR analogues, of <lb/>which the modifications were mainly focused on pyrophos-<lb/>phate linkage and adenosine. Their effects on TRPM2 chan-<lb/>nel were evaluated. Compounds 7i and 8a were confirmed as <lb/>TRPM2 inhibitors with moderate activity, exerting intracellu-<lb/>lar inhibition of TRPM2 current, and demonstrating selectivity <lb/>over other TRP members including TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 <lb/>and TRPV3. Besides, a more sufficient SAR of ADPR-<lb/>analogue TRPM2 inhibitors was summarized in this study. <lb/>In summary, we synthesized and obtained two novel <lb/>subtype selective TRPM2 inhibitors. The newly identified <lb/>TRPM2 inhibitors can serve as new pharmacological tools for <lb/>further investigation and validation of TRPM2 channel as a <lb/>drug target. The summarized SAR may also provide insights <lb/>into further improving existing inhibitors as potential lead <lb/>compounds. <lb/></body>
