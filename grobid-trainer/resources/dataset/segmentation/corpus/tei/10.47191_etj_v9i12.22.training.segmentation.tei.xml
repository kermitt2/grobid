This research was conducted based on information obtained from questionnaires distributed to respondents. <lb/>This research sampling technique uses purposive sampling method. This research uses quantitative methods by distributing <lb/>questionnaires to 132 local officials who work in the Regional Apparatus Organization of Nagan Raya Regency. The data analysis <lb/>technique used is multiple linear regression with analysis tools using SPSS 26 software. The results of this study indicate that <lb/>legislative oversight and leadership style have a positive effect on budget transparency. While regulation and technology utilization <lb/>have a negative effect on budget transparency. <lb/>KEYWORDS: Budget Transparency, Leadership Style, Legislative Oversight, Regulation, Technology Utilization. <lb/></front>

    <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Reforms in local government management aim to realize good governance. The implementation of good governance can be fulfilled <lb/>if it adheres to three basic principles, namely: transparent, accountable, and participatory (Harrison &amp; Sayogo, 2014; Mesak, 2016). <lb/>These three principles can be used by the community as a means of control over local governments in organizing government functions <lb/>and public services. The principle of transparency in local government is more emphasized on aspects of local budget management <lb/>(Nurwanda &amp; Badriah, 2022). <lb/>The obligation to submit local government information has been regulated in the Minister of Home Affairs Regulation No. 13 of 2006 <lb/>concerning Regional Financial Management Guidelines, which states that transparency is the principle of openness that allows the <lb/>public to know and gain access to information more broadly about regional finances. Law No. 14/2008 on Public Information <lb/>Disclosure requires every public body to provide and serve requests for public information in a fast, timely, low-cost and simple <lb/>manner. Article 9 states that local governments are obliged to publish public information in the form of activities and performance as <lb/>well as information on financial reports on a regular basis. In addition, local governments are required to provide public information <lb/>that is accurate, correct and not misleading. <lb/>Government Regulation No. 71 of 2010 concerning Government Accounting Standards explains the concept of transparency is to <lb/>provide open and honest information to the public because the public has the right to know the efforts that have been made by the <lb/>government in managing the resources that have been entrusted. Followed by the Minister of Finance Regulation No. 74 of 2016 <lb/>concerning the Implementation of Regional Financial Information Systems emphasizes that the government is obliged to manage <lb/>financial data to be presented to the public for consideration. The regulation explains that local governments must realize the <lb/>acquisition of financial information in order to create good governance. Transparency is defined as the disclosure of information by <lb/>an organization that allows outsiders to monitor and assess its internal work and performance (Bearfield &amp; Bowman, 2017). <lb/>According to Government Regulation No. 71 of 2010 concerning Government Accounting Standards, transparency is providing open <lb/>and honest financial information to the public based on the consideration that the public has the right to know openly and thoroughly <lb/>about the government&apos;s accountability in managing the resources entrusted to it and its compliance with laws and regulations. <lb/>Nagan Raya Regent Regulation Number 11 of 2020 concerning Guidelines for Management of Information and Documentation <lb/>Services (MIDS) within the Government of Nagan Raya Regency Article 11 states that MIDS is tasked with providing and publishing <lb/>information on the Agency/Service Website to be accessed by the public, one of which is information regarding financial reports. <lb/>However, based on the results of observations of the website, each Agency/Service within the scope of Nagan Raya Regency mostly <lb/>does not have a website that can be accessed by the public. Each Agency/Service uses one website, namely the Nagan Raya Regency <lb/>website. <lb/>Based on observations of the Nagan Raya Regency website which can be accessed via the link https://www.naganrayakab.go.id/, it <lb/>can be seen that the budget information uploaded on the website is only financial reports for the last 2 years, namely 2020 and 2021. <lb/></body>

    <body>Therefore, the use of the budget cannot be compared every year. This is not in accordance with Nagan Raya Regent Regulation <lb/>Number 11 of 2020 concerning Guidelines for Management of Information and Documentation Services within the Government of <lb/>Nagan Raya Regency Article 11. In addition, the uploaded financial report documents are incomplete such as the lack of notes on <lb/>financial statements in the local government financial report section. The components that must be reported at least consist of budget <lb/>realization reports, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and notes to financial statements. These components are contained in <lb/>Government Regulation Number 8 of 2006 concerning Financial and Performance Reporting of Government Agencies Article 5. <lb/>Then the local government of Nagan Raya Regency does not have guidelines for budget transparency like those of other local <lb/>governments, one of which is the local government of East Belitung Regency. <lb/>Budget transparency is considered a necessary condition for a sustainable economy, good governance, and honesty in budget <lb/>management in general (Montes &amp; Luna, 2021). More transparent budgets are associated with increased government effectiveness, <lb/>so higher levels of fiscal transparency have lower inflation rates (Montes et al., 2019; Montes &amp; da Cunha Lima, 2018). The <lb/>importance of transparency to integrate public value into the budgeting process can help balance democratic demands with efficiency <lb/>needs (Bracci et al., 2019). The results of research by Bisogno &amp; Cuadrado-Ballesteros (2021) state that the implementation of reforms <lb/>to embrace the &quot;openness&quot; movement is intended to increase budget transparency, politicians and managers must consider not only <lb/>the effects of public trust and participation but must also pay attention to the link between budget transparency and government <lb/>financial sustainability. <lb/>Based on previous research, there are a number of variables that can affect Budget Transparency such as Legislative Oversight (Ríos <lb/>et al., 2016), Regulation (Fajri et al., 2021), Technology Utilization (Chen et al., 2018), and leadership style (Andriyani, 2016). The <lb/>first factor that affects Budget Transparency is Legislative Oversight. The legislature is a government agency that has the authority <lb/>to make regulations and oversee the implementation of approved regulations. In the supervisory function, the budget that has been <lb/>prepared by the executive will be supervised by the legislature which is useful to avoid misuse of the budget and show the public how <lb/>the legislature supervises the executive. The Legislative Oversight instrument is used to account for the authority delegated to the <lb/>executive in an appropriate manner and can contribute to the prevention of corruption. Research results show that Legislative <lb/>Oversight affects Budget Transparency, as stronger Legislative Oversight results in greater Budget Transparency (Dikmen &amp; Çiçek, <lb/>2019; Ríos et al., 2016, 2018). <lb/>The second factor affecting Budget Transparency is Regulation. In managing the budget, the legislature has approved the stipulation <lb/>of laws, government regulations and local regulations that must be implemented by local governments as budget users. The regulations <lb/>are outlined in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 14 of 2008 concerning Public Information Disclosure, followed by <lb/>Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 16 of 2010 concerning the Implementation of Law of the Republic of <lb/>Indonesia Number 14 of 2008 concerning Public Information Disclosure, then Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs Number <lb/>35 of 2010 concerning Guidelines for Management of Information and Documentation Services within the Ministry of Home Affairs <lb/>and Local Governments, then Information Commission Regulation Number 1 of 2010 concerning Public Information Service <lb/>Standards, in the following year issued Information Commission Regulation Number 1 of 2013 concerning Procedures for Resolving <lb/>Public Information Disputes. This was followed by Regulations from each Region on the Guidelines for Public Information Services <lb/>and Documentation within the Government, on Governance of Public Information Disclosure in the Implementation of Government, <lb/>on the Determination of Information Management and Documentation Officers within the Provincial Government, on Guidelines for <lb/>Public Information Services and Documentation within the Local Government. <lb/>Regulations are used as guidelines or guidelines in the implementation of budget management. Local governments are required to <lb/>carry out budget management as written in the regulations that have been set, if the government violates or does not carry out the <lb/>budget according to the regulations, it will be subject to penalties in the form of sanctions or fines in accordance with what is written <lb/>and determined. The budget is used to measure government policies as seen from the goals and efforts made by the government in <lb/>serving the community (Dikmen &amp; Çiçek, 2019). Regulations set by the government are a tool to fulfill the achievement of future <lb/>goals as a form of policy implementation. Political competition can increase transparency, but governments with high levels of <lb/>political competition can also inhibit changes in regulations and thus hinder transparency (Caamaño-Alegre et al., 2013). <lb/>In Latin America, the Organization of American States (OAS) has called for the adoption of disclosure laws, but research by García-<lb/>Tabuyo et al. (2015) states that many local managers still maintain the use of traditional policies in secret and ignore information <lb/></body>

    <body>disclosure regulations, resulting in many cases of corruption in local governments. This means that better application of regulations <lb/>will increase budget transparency. <lb/>The third factor affecting Budget Transparency is Technology Utilization. Technology is a tool created to facilitate human work <lb/>(Lantu et al., 2023). Not infrequently, the use of technology replaces human labor as the times progress. Technology utilization is <lb/>also felt by the government as a form of making it easier to complete a job. Forms of technology use in local government through <lb/>applications or software in budget preparation, dissemination of budget information, for example through websites, social media, <lb/>email, and others. Utilization of existing technology in government is accompanied by knowledge of the use of technology. One of <lb/>the government activities is to take part in training on the use of technology that will be used by local governments. The transparency <lb/>law requires the government to be more transparent in delivering government programs through the use of technology that can be <lb/>seen by the wider community, commonly referred to as e-government. <lb/>E-government is a technology used by government agencies to improve transparency in both performance and finance. The use of e-<lb/>government provides many benefits to the government and society such as: the public can oversee the course of budget absorption <lb/>being carried out by the Regional Apparatus Organization (RAO), information is received more quickly, information is accurate and <lb/>more reliable. Public accountability and transparency are getting better if they utilize information technology (Nasution &amp; Rizqy <lb/>Ramadhan, 2019). The public can participate and oversee regional finances with the existence of Budget Transparency through the <lb/>use of information technology. Several studies show that Technology Utilization affects Budget Transparency, for example Chen et <lb/>al. (2018), Nasution &amp; Rizqy Ramadhan (2019), and Puron-Cid &amp; Bolívar (2018). Conversely, there are several studies that find that <lb/>Technology Utilization has no effect on Budget Transparency, for example Mourao et al. (2020) and Mutmainnah et al. (2023). <lb/>The fourth factor that can affect Budget Transparency is Leadership Style. A leader is someone who has a role or position that in <lb/>making decisions will influence others in their actions in an organization. Whether or not an organization&apos;s goals are achieved depends <lb/>on the decisions made by a leader. Research by Amelia (2015) and Andriyani (2016) found that Leadership Style has an effect on <lb/>Budget Transparency. Meanwhile, Sari (2017) found that Leadership Style has no effect on Budget Transparency. <lb/>Based on the sequence of phenomena that occur in local governments and the inconsistencies in the results of previous research on <lb/>how the influence of legislative oversight, regulation, technology utilization, and leadership style on budget transparency. The <lb/>limitations of previous research in this area have become an interesting trigger for researchers to conduct further exploration. To <lb/>bridge the gap of previous research, this study takes an innovative approach by integrating the regulation variable as an independent <lb/>variable. The use of regulatory variables as independent variables is a novelty in research, thus providing a unique aspect in this study. <lb/>Therefore, this study re-examines how legislative oversight, regulation, technology utilization, and leadership style affect budget <lb/>transparency with budget transparency regulation as a new variable used in the study. <lb/>Furthermore, to extend the reach of the research, this study adopts a comprehensive approach by investigating each element in budget <lb/>transparency partially. The ultimate goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of legislative oversight, regulation, <lb/>technology use, and leadership style on budget transparency, especially in the context of local government. Therefore, a rigorous <lb/>analysis of each of these elements aims to reveal how legislative oversight, regulation, technology use, and leadership style affect the <lb/>level of budget transparency. Using this approach, researchers hope to make an important contribution to scientific knowledge by <lb/>providing more detailed and contextualized insights into the complex relationships between legislative oversight, regulation, <lb/>technology use, and leadership style with budget transparency. <lb/>THEORETICAL BASE <lb/>Agency Theory <lb/>Agency theory describes an agreement (contract) between a principal and an agent, where the principal authorizes the agent to make <lb/>decisions on their behalf (Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976). According to the literature, transparency can be defined from the principal-<lb/>agent theory, considering it as the ability to know what is happening within public sector organizations through various means such <lb/>as open meetings, access to records or proactive posting of information on Web sites (Piotrowski &amp; Ryzin, 2007). Other scholars <lb/>have framed the determinants of transparency within the confines of agency theory (Alt &amp; Lassen, 2006; Archidona &amp; Gandı, 2008). <lb/>By increasing budget transparency, local governments can address potential moral issues in budget management. Online information <lb/>can reduce uncertainty about agent behavior, thus making principals more confident in delegating power to agents (Holmstrom, 1979). <lb/></body>

    <body>Budget Transparency <lb/>Florini (2000) defines transparency as the release of information by institutions that is relevant for evaluating those institutions. This <lb/>approach emphasizes two fundamental pillars on which transparency is based (Cucciniello et al., 2017). The first pillar is the <lb/>availability of information that is investigated with various issues such as political or budgetary issues, administrative procedures <lb/>(Meijer et al., 2012; Pina et al., 2010), operational issues (Tejedo-Romero &amp; de Araujo, 2018), or the performance of public sector <lb/>entities (Cuadrado-Ballesteros, 2014). The meaning in transparency after testing results emphasizes that it is not just the information <lb/>itself that matters, but the fact that it can be found (Williams, 2015). Therefore, transparency must rely on the quality and quantity of <lb/>information disclosed in order to build trust and accountability (Porumbescu et al., 2017; Wang &amp; Niu, 2020). Budget transparency <lb/>is measured using 4 indicators, namely: 1) availability and accessibility; 2) need and completeness of information; 3) process <lb/>openness; 4) regulatory framework that ensures transparency (Nurhadianto &amp; Khamisah, 2019; Ritonga &amp; Syahrir, 2016). <lb/>Legislative Oversight <lb/>According to Article 20A paragraph 1 of the 1945 Constitution, the House of Representatives (DPR) has a legislative function, a <lb/>budgetary function, and a supervisory function. The legislature has a role in making policies and overseeing the course of policies <lb/>that have been agreed upon and approved. Legislative oversight can be done before, after, or during law enforcement and can be done <lb/>internally or externally to the legislature (Pelizzo &amp; Stapenhurst, 2013). Although legislators in developing countries approve <lb/>government budgets and policies, they tend to be weak in monitoring and evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of these <lb/>policies. There is no guarantee that legislative committees will have control over policy making (Clinton et al., 2012). Higher <lb/>legislative involvement in the budget process will lead to fiscal discipline and budget transparency (Ríos et al., 2018). Further, strong <lb/>legislative power over budget decisions is not only associated with fiscal indiscipline but also with budget transparency. This means <lb/>that legislative oversight affects budget transparency. The results of this study are supported by the research of Ríos et al. (2016) <lb/>which also states that legislative oversight affects budget transparency. Legislative oversight is measured using 3 indicators, namely: <lb/>1) legislative oversight before budget execution (leg.pre); 2) legislative oversight during budget execution (leg.dur); 3) legislative <lb/>oversight after budget execution (leg.post) (Ríos et al., 2016). So it can be concluded that the hypothesis in this study is as follows. <lb/>H1: Legislative oversight affects budget transparency. <lb/>Regulation <lb/>Regulations on budget transparency refer to policies, regulations, or frameworks implemented by governments or other entities to <lb/>ensure that information relating to public budgets or public funds is presented in a transparent, open, clear, and easily accessible <lb/>manner to the public. Strict regulations are more likely to enforce the transparent presentation of financial statements (Costello et al., <lb/>2019). This suggests that regulation is an important role in enforcing budget transparency. The implementation of stronger regulations <lb/>will improve financial information (Watanabe et al., 2019). Lack of transparency regulations and regulatory inconsistencies can hinder <lb/>the implementation of the budget transparency process to be ineffective and efficient (Nurunnabi, 2014). Nurdiansyah&apos;s research <lb/>(2016) states that regulation affects budget transparency. This research is supported by Baharuddin&apos;s research (2020) which states that <lb/>regulation affects transparency in the form of successful implementation of regulations to realize more transparent information <lb/>disclosure. Regulation is measured using 3 indicators, namely: 1) availability, socialization and understanding of regulations; 2) <lb/>consistency and ease of implementation; 3) response and linkages between regulations (Fajri et al., 2021). Therefore, it can be <lb/>concluded that the second hypothesis in this study is as follows. <lb/>H2: Regulation affects Budget Transparency. <lb/>Technology Utilization <lb/>The development of the times that requires an organization to use technology in every job, one of which is in information transparency. <lb/>Many local government organizations use the web to provide information transparency through e-government. The ease of using e-<lb/>government in obtaining information about budget transparency in a complete, accurate, timely, and understandable manner is the <lb/>government&apos;s added value to the public (Cohen et al., 2022) norn (Nor et al., 2021). Governments that want to improve effectiveness <lb/>and efficiency must improve fiscal transparency supported by adopting technology and information (Chen et al., 2018; Montes et al., <lb/>2019). Governments that have smooth internet access can easily use technology to disseminate information and people who have <lb/>internet access can easily search for government financial information (Mourao et al., 2020). Technology utilization is measured using <lb/></body>

    <body>2 indicators, namely: 1) technology suitability and 2) technology complexity (Gil-García &amp; Pardo, 2005; Puron-Cid, 2014; Zhang &amp; <lb/>Hsieh, 2010). So it can be concluded that the third hypothesis in this study is as follows. <lb/>H3: Technology Utilization affects Budget Transparency. <lb/>Leadership Style <lb/>Leadership is a person&apos;s action to influence others in understanding the tasks that must be carried out in order to improve performance, <lb/>the greater the leadership style, the more member performance increases (Mukmin &amp; Prasetyo, 2021). According to Aris (2020), the <lb/>characteristics of this leadership are characterized by upholding moral values such as honesty, justice, loyalty and responsibility so <lb/>that their rights and responsibilities are achieved. Leadership style in government organizations can help in implementing financial <lb/>reporting transparency, because a leader will influence the planning, implementation, and success in achieving the goals of the <lb/>government organization he leads (Andriyani, 2016). Leaders who have a commitment in their leadership style to follow compliance <lb/>with penalties and regulations will realize the goals of government organizations (Amelia, 2015). Leadership style is measured using <lb/>4 indicators, namely: 1) telling style (directing style); 2) selling style (offering style); 3) participating style (participation style); 4) <lb/>delegating style (delegation style) (Henkel &amp; Bourdeau, 2018). So it can be concluded that the fourth hypothesis in this study is as <lb/>follows. <lb/>H4: Leadership style affects budget transparency. <lb/>RESEARCH METHOD <lb/>In this study, the population used was all officials who worked in the regional work unit of Nagan Raya Regency. The sampling <lb/>technique used in this study was purposive sampling. The sampling criteria used in this study are only government officials who act <lb/>directly in budget management, namely the head of the OPD, Secretary of the OPD, Head of the finance subdivision, so that there are <lb/>132 respondents used as samples. The primary data collected in this study will be analyzed with the help of the SPSS program which <lb/>aims to predict the population average and the average value of the dependent variable. To see the effect of the variables studied on <lb/>budget transparency, the study used multiple linear regression analysis with the following regression equation: <lb/>Y = α + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X4 + e <lb/>Where: <lb/>Y = Budget Transparency (dependent variable) <lb/>α = Constant <lb/>β1 = Legislative Oversight regression coefficient <lb/>β2 = Regulatory regression coefficient <lb/>β3 = Technology Utilization regression coefficient <lb/>β4 = Regression coefficient Leadership style <lb/>X1 = Legislative Oversight (independent variable) <lb/>X2 = Regulation (independent variable) <lb/>X3 = Technology Utilization (independent variable) <lb/>X4 = Leadership Style (independent variable) <lb/>e = Standard error <lb/>RESEARCH RESULTS <lb/>The research sample obtained the results of the number of questionnaires totaling 132 questionnaires. The variable descriptions in <lb/>this study include mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. <lb/></body>

    <body>Hypothesis Test Results <lb/>The following are the results of the hypothesis test shown in table 5: <lb/>Table 5. Hypothesis Test Results <lb/>Coefficients a <lb/>Model <lb/>Unstandardized <lb/>Coefficients <lb/>Standardized <lb/>Coefficients <lb/>t <lb/>Sig. <lb/>B <lb/>Std.

Dependent Variable: Budget Transparency <lb/>Based on the results of multiple linear regression tests, legislative oversight has a significance value smaller than 0.05, this means that <lb/>the legislative oversight variable has a significant effect on the budget transparency variable. Regulation has a significance value l <lb/>than 0.05, this means that the regulation variable has a significant effect on the budget transparency variable. Technology utilization <lb/>has a significance value of less than 0.05, this means that the technology utilization variable has a significant effect on the budget <lb/>transparency variable. Leadership style has a significance value of less than 0.05, this means that the leadership style variable has a <lb/>significant effect on the budget transparency variable. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The Effect of Legislative Oversight on Budget Transparency <lb/>Legislative oversight has a positive and significant effect on budget transparency. This means that if legislative members supervise <lb/>more frequently the running of the budget to SKPK, the more transparent the budget used by SKPK will be. This is in line with agency <lb/>theory, namely the conflict of interest between the principal and the agent. The legislature as a representative of the community plays <lb/>an important role in monitoring and evaluating the actions of the government as an agent. Legislative oversight can serve as a control <lb/>mechanism to ensure that policies implemented by the government are in line with the public interest and in accordance with the <lb/>mandate given by the principal. This study is in line with the results of research conducted by Costello et al. (2019), Dikmen &amp; Çiçek <lb/>(2019), Keyifli (2021),and Ríos et al. (2016, 2018) which state that legislative oversight has an effect on budget transparency, where <lb/>the role of legislative institutions can help reduce the obscurity of budgets used by government agencies through their supervision. <lb/>Effect of Regulation on Budget Transparency <lb/>Regulation has a negative and significant effect on budget transparency. These results indicate that regulatory aspects such as certain <lb/>rules or policies can have an impact that hinders transparency in budget management. This can happen if the interval between changing <lb/>one regulation to the next is so fast, thus slowing down the transparency process. The results of this study are inversely proportional <lb/>to agency theory because the results of the study state that regulations can reduce the level of budget transparency. This can happen <lb/>if the application of complex regulations is not accompanied by the quantity and quality of human resources and the utilization of <lb/>technology so that it is difficult to carry out processes in budget transparency. This research is not in line with the research of Montero <lb/>et al. (2020) which states that regulation has a positive effect on transparency so that the application of regulations can increase budget <lb/>transparency. <lb/>Effect of Technology Utilization on Budget Transparency <lb/>Technology utilization has a negative and significant effect on budget transparency. This negative effect indicates that constraints or <lb/>challenges related to technology utilization in the budget process can hinder the level of openness and accountability in the <lb/>management of public funds. The results of this study are inversely proportional to agency theory because the results of the study <lb/></body>

    <body>state that technology utilization can reduce the level of budget transparency. This could happen if government officials do not want <lb/>to disclose the entire budget. The results of this study are in line with previous research which states that technology utilization affects <lb/>budget transparency (Chen et al., 2018; Mutmainnah et al., 2023; Nasution &amp; Ramadhan, 2019; Nugraha &amp; Wibowo, 2020; Valle-<lb/>Cruz et al., 2015). This research is also supported by Pratolo &amp; Fadilah&apos;s research (2022) which states that technology utilization has <lb/>a significant and negative effect on transparency. <lb/>Effect of Leadership Style on Budget Transparency <lb/>Leadership style has a positive and significant effect on budget transparency. This finding indicates that an effective leadership style <lb/>can have a positive impact on increasing openness and accountability in the management of public funds. This is in line with agency <lb/>theory, namely the existence of conflicts of interest when a leader who understands the principles of agency theory will realize the <lb/>importance of minimizing the risk of conflicts of interest through concrete actions that increase transparency. Applying the principles <lb/>of accountability, clearly communicating budget decisions, and opening an open dialog with stakeholders are leadership strategies <lb/>that support budget transparency efforts. Leaders who are able to lead with integrity, promote accountability, and open up to <lb/>information exchange with stakeholders can create an environment that supports budget transparency, reduces the risk of agency <lb/>conflicts, and builds trust in government financial management. The results of this study are in line with previous research which <lb/>states that leadership style affects budget transparency (Andriyani, 2016; Basri et al., 2021; Mensah &amp; Qi, 2016). However, this <lb/>research is not in line with the research of Puspitasari et al. (2022) and Sari (2017) which state that leadership style has no effect on <lb/>budget transparency. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>This study aims to examine the effect of legislative oversight, regulation, technology utilization, and leadership style on budget <lb/>transparency. Based on the test results from primary data, it can be concluded that legislative oversight has a positive effect on budget <lb/>transparency in the local government of Nagan Raya Regency, regulation has a negative effect on budget transparency in the local <lb/>government of Nagan Raya Regency, technology utilization has a negative effect on budget transparency in the local government of <lb/>Nagan Raya Regency, and leadership style has a positive effect on budget transparency in the local government of Nagan Raya <lb/>Regency. <lb/>IMPLICATIONS <lb/>Taking into account the research findings, it is hoped that local governments can increase transparency in budget disclosure by <lb/>involving legislative institutions in overseeing and ensuring budget management. In addition, it needs to be accompanied by the <lb/>procurement of appropriate technology and the need for re-evaluation of existing regulations so as not to hinder the course of budget <lb/>transparency. Finally, local officials can implement a leadership style that prioritizes transparency values in public budget <lb/>management. To achieve the success of this research, it should be recognized that this study has several limitations that need to be <lb/>considered, namely, this research only focuses on one region so that it cannot be a picture that can represent other regions. For future <lb/>researchers, this research can be developed by expanding the object of research such as taking objects throughout Indonesia. Then, <lb/>the selection of respondents should use officials who are not financial managers to avoid sampling bias in the research results. <lb/></body>
