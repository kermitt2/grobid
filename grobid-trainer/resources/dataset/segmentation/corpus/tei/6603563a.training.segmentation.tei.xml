To identify genetic alterations that reflect the characteristics of the <lb/>tumour in vivo, we screened a total of 23 microdissected PDAC tissue samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridisation <lb/>(array CGH) with 1 Mb resolution. Highly stringent statistical analysis enabled us to define the regions of nonrandom genomic <lb/>changes. We detected a total of 41 contiguous regions (43.0 Mb) of copy number changes, such as a genetic gain at 7p22.2 – p15.1 <lb/>(26.0 Mb) and losses at 17p13.3 – p11.2 (13.6 Mb), 18q21.2 – q22.1 (12.0 Mb), 18q22.3 – q23 (7.1 Mb) and 18q12.3 – q21.2 (6.9 Mb). <lb/>To validate our array CGH results, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed using four probes from those regions, showing <lb/>that these genetic alterations were observed in 37 – 68% of a separate sample set of 19 PDAC cases. In particular, deletion of the <lb/> SEC11L3 gene (18q21.32) was detected at a very high frequency (13 out of 19 cases; 68%) and in situ RNA hybridisation for this gene <lb/>demonstrated a significant correlation between deletion and expression levels. It was further confirmed by reverse transcription – <lb/>PCR that SEC11L3 mRNA was downregulated in 16 out of 16 PDAC tissues (100%). In conclusion, the combination of tissue <lb/>microdissection and array CGH provided a valid data set that represents in vivo genetic changes in PDAC. Our results raise the <lb/>possibility that the SEC11L3 gene may play a role as a tumour suppressor in this disease. <lb/> British Journal of Cancer (2007) 96, 373 – 382. doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6603563 www.bjcancer.com <lb/> &amp; 2007 Cancer Research UK <lb/> Keywords: pancreatic cancer; tissue microdissection; array CGH; SEC11L3 <lb/></front>

			<body> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading <lb/>cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Although the <lb/>prognosis of patients with many types of cancer has improved <lb/>recently due to advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, <lb/>the outlook for patients with PDAC still remains dismal with a <lb/>median survival of just 6 months from diagnosis and an overall 5-<lb/>year survival rate of less than 5% (Warshaw and Fernandez-del <lb/>Castillo, 1992; Murr et al, 1994; Jemal et al, 2005). Many previous <lb/>studies have attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms <lb/>underlying pancreatic tumorigenesis, but it is still not fully <lb/>understood. Therefore, a better understanding of the genes <lb/>involved in tumour growth and progression is necessary for the <lb/>development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that <lb/>could improve the outcome of this deadly disease. <lb/>Array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) is <lb/>a powerful technique that has been used to detect DNA copy <lb/>number alterations across the entire genome of malignant tumours <lb/>(Solinas-Toldo et al, 1997; Pinkel et al, 1998; Pollack et al, 1999; <lb/>Albertson et al, 2000; Snijders et al, 2001; Fiegler et al, 2003). <lb/>Compared to conventional CGH, the significantly improved <lb/>resolution of array CGH permits highly accurate mapping of <lb/>DNA copy number changes throughout the genome. In cancer, <lb/>genomic alterations contribute to dysregulation of the expression <lb/>levels of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, the accumula-<lb/>tion of which is correlated with tumour progression (Ried et al, <lb/> 1999). Therefore, array CGH provides a promising starting point <lb/>for the identification of novel candidate genes affected by such <lb/>genomic imbalances. Several array CGH investigations of PDAC <lb/>have already been reported, but all these studies were performed <lb/>on cell lines or whole tissue samples (Aguirre et al, 2004; <lb/>Heidenblad et al, 2004; Holzmann et al, 2004; Mahlamaki et al, <lb/> 2004; Bashyam et al, 2005; Gysin et al, 2005; Nowak et al, 2005). In <lb/>cell lines, culture-induced genetic adaptation may be induced <lb/>during the establishment of cell lines in in vitro conditions. On the <lb/>other hand, PDAC tissues are characterised by a desmoplastic <lb/>reaction, with neoplastic cells constituting only a small proportion <lb/>of the tumour mass. Therefore, cytogenetic analysis using bulk <lb/>tissue samples is invariably hampered by contamination with non-<lb/>neoplastic cells. <lb/></body>

			<body>The aim of this study is to identify novel genetic abnormalities <lb/>that precisely reflect the characteristics of tumour cells in vivo. For <lb/>this purpose, we applied array CGH to 23 microdissected PDAC <lb/>tissue samples that consist of purified populations of cancer cells. <lb/>Then, a subset of identified genetic alterations was evaluated in an <lb/>independent sample set of 19 PDAC cases using fluorescence in <lb/>situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis. Finally, in situ RNA hybridisa-<lb/>tion (ISH) and reverse transcription – PCR (RT – PCR) were <lb/>performed to assess whether the identified genetic alteration could <lb/>lead to significant change in transcript level of the gene in <lb/>question. <lb/> MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/> Tissue samples <lb/> A total of 23 fresh-frozen PDAC specimens were obtained <lb/>surgically or at autopsy from Yamaguchi University School of <lb/>Medicine, Japan, with appropriate ethical approval (Table 1). All <lb/>the tissues were confirmed histologically by a pathologist. Tissue <lb/>microdissection was performed manually to collect more than 90% <lb/>of tumour cells in all the cases as described previously (Harada <lb/> et al, 2002a). Briefly, only cancerous regions were microdissected <lb/>using a sterile 26-gauge needle from several serial tissue sections <lb/>(20 mm thickness) under visualisation with an inverted microscope <lb/>(Nikon 66906, Tokyo, Japan). DNA was extracted from at least <lb/>5000 tumour cells according to the standard protocol. Reference <lb/>DNA was obtained from lymphocytes of both healthy male and <lb/>female volunteers. In addition, another series of 19 formalin-fixed, <lb/>paraffin-embedded tumour sections (4 mm thickness) were pro-<lb/>vided from Yamaguchi University (n ¼ 10) and Tohoku University <lb/>School of Medicine, Japan (n ¼ 9), for FISH and ISH analyses <lb/>(Table 1). Owing to the limited accessibility of clinical specimens, <lb/>the samples used in array CGH were not available for FISH and <lb/>ISH. For RT – PCR, 16 fresh-frozen PDAC tissues and two normal <lb/>pancreas tissues were obtained from the Human Biomaterials <lb/>Resource Centre, Department of Histopathology, Charing Cross <lb/> Table 1 The clinicopathological data of PDAC tissue samples <lb/> Sample <lb/>Age <lb/>Sex <lb/>Location a <lb/> Histology b <lb/> T <lb/>N <lb/>M <lb/>Stage <lb/> (A) Microdissected fresh-frozen tissue samples used for array CGH (n ¼ 23) <lb/> PC1 <lb/>66 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>II <lb/>PC2 <lb/>66 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>well <lb/>3 <lb/>1a <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC3 <lb/>66 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC4 <lb/>59 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC5 <lb/>64 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC6 <lb/>47 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC7 <lb/>66 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC8 <lb/>69 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>poor <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC9 <lb/>73 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC10 <lb/>56 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pt) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC11 <lb/>76 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC12 <lb/>63 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC13 <lb/>78 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pt) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC14 <lb/>68 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC15 <lb/>65 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC16 <lb/>65 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC17 <lb/>60 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC18 <lb/>76 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC19 <lb/>54 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>poor <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC20 <lb/>72 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pt) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC34 <lb/>60 <lb/>M <lb/>LM <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC35 <lb/>75 <lb/>M <lb/>LM <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC36 <lb/>67 <lb/>F <lb/>LM <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1b <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/> (B) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections used for FISH and ISH (n ¼ 19) <lb/> PC37 <lb/>74 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>2 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>I <lb/>PC38 <lb/>72 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pt) <lb/>poor <lb/>3 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>II <lb/>PC39 <lb/>70 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC40 <lb/>58 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC41 <lb/>69 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>well <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC42 <lb/>51 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>poor <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC43 <lb/>73 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC44 <lb/>59 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>III <lb/>PC45 <lb/>53 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC46 <lb/>53 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC47 <lb/>56 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>well <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>IVa <lb/>PC48 <lb/>57 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC49 <lb/>65 <lb/>F <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC50 <lb/>59 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC51 <lb/>61 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Ph) <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC52 <lb/>74 <lb/>M <lb/>P(Pb) <lb/>poor <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC53 <lb/>57 <lb/>F <lb/>LM <lb/>mod <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC54 <lb/>61 <lb/>M <lb/>LM <lb/>mod <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/>PC55 <lb/>74 <lb/>M <lb/>LM <lb/>poor <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>IVb <lb/> a <lb/> P ¼ primary lesion; Ph ¼ head; Pb ¼ body; Pt ¼ tail of the pancreas; LM ¼ liver metastatic lesion. b mod ¼ moderately; poor ¼ poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. <lb/>PDAC ¼ pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; FISH ¼ fluorescence in situ hybridisation; ISH ¼ in situ RNA hybridisation. <lb/>

			Hospital, London, UK, with full ethical approval of the host <lb/>institution. The clinicopathological information was not available <lb/>for these anonymous samples. Haematoxylin – eosin-stained slides <lb/>were examined to ensure a content of 60 – 80% tumour cells before <lb/>use and then, total RNA was extracted directly from homogenised <lb/>tissues using TRIZOL (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK). <lb/> CGH arrays and image acquisition <lb/> The whole-genome CGH arrays were produced at the Wellcome <lb/>Trust Sanger Institute and consist of 3125 BAC/PAC clones that <lb/>cover the entire human genome at 1 Mb resolution (Fiegler et al, <lb/> 2003). All the clone details are available on the Ensembl genome <lb/>browser (v39, June 2006; http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/ <lb/>index.html). <lb/>Array CGH was performed as described previously, with minor <lb/>modifications (Fiegler et al, 2003; Hurst et al, 2004). Briefly, <lb/>tumour and reference DNAs (300 ng) were labelled with Cy5-dCTP <lb/>and Cy3-dCTP, respectively. Hybridisation was carried out at 371C <lb/>for 36 h in a hybridisation chamber (GeneMachines, San Carlos, <lb/>CA, USA). After washing the slides, fluorescence intensities were <lb/>measured on an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments Inc., <lb/>Burlingame, CA, USA) and the raw images were analysed using the <lb/>GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon). Duplicate hybridisations were <lb/>performed for each sample to verify the reproducibility of the data <lb/>except for one case (PC5). The correlation coefficients were <lb/>calculated on the normalised tumour channel and observed to <lb/>range from 0.63 to 0.90 (data not shown). <lb/> Statistical and data analysis <lb/> The CGH arrays were read with the UCSF &apos;SPOT&apos; software to <lb/>produce raw text files (Jain et al, 2002). These files were read into R <lb/>and normalised (using the loess intensity-dependent method), <lb/>using the &apos;limma&apos; package (Smyth, 2005; The R Development Core <lb/>Team, 2006); background correction was omitted in this case, as <lb/>visual inspection showed it increased the scatter in both the MA <lb/>and chromosomal-location plots, and the correlation statistics <lb/>were worse with background subtraction, indicative of low levels of <lb/>background on the slides being misestimated. The log 2 -trans-<lb/>formed normalised data were then pre-processed to average any <lb/>on-slide replicates using the &apos;snapCGH&apos; package from Bioconduc-<lb/>tor and segmented into local regions of constant copy number by <lb/>circular binary segmentation (Gentleman et al, 2004; Olshen et al, <lb/> 2004). The sample levels (two replicates for each tumour per clone) <lb/>were summarised by means to give tumour-level data (one <lb/>measurement per clone for each tumour). These data were then <lb/>used in a linear model that estimated the fold change across the <lb/>tumours, along with a P-value that the average log 2 -fold change <lb/>between the tumour channel and the normal channel was non-zero <lb/>(for both the normalised data and the locally smoothed data – data <lb/>not shown for the latter). Clones that had an uncorrected P-value <lb/> below 0.001 were considered to be significant candidates. <lb/> Two-colour FISH <lb/> Four human BAC clones (RP11-403N12, RP11-232C20, RP11-8H2 <lb/>and RP11-350K6) were purchased from BACPAC Resources <lb/>(Oakland, CA, USA) and these DNAs were labelled with Cy3-<lb/>dCTP using BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling System <lb/>(Invitrogen). Centromeric probes for chromosomes 7 and 18 <lb/>(CEP7 and 18), labelled with SpectrumGreen, were purchased from <lb/>Vysis (Downers Grove, IL, USA). The specificity of all the probes <lb/>was confirmed by hybridisation onto Normal Male Metaphase <lb/>(Vysis). <lb/>Two-colour FISH was performed as described previously (Lu <lb/> et al, 1999). DNA copy number was evaluated for each probe by <lb/>counting spots in at least 100 nuclei. A ratio was calculated <lb/>between the average copy number of the BAC probes and of <lb/>corresponding centromeric probes. Based on hybridisation in 10 <lb/>normal pancreatic tissues (acinar and ductal cells), the threshold of <lb/>gain and loss was defined as the ratios of 41.16 ( þ 2 standard <lb/>deviation (s.d.)) and o0.87 (À2 s.d.), respectively (data not <lb/>shown). Our approach was to use normal samples to estimate <lb/>overall noise levels: choosing the threshold on the tumour samples <lb/>corresponding to a 72 s.d. of the normal samples indicates a <lb/>roughly 5% false-positive rate if the tumour samples were <lb/>commensurate with diploidy. <lb/> In situ RNA hybridisation for SEC11L3 <lb/> The SEC11L3 probe was amplified by PCR from OriGene clone <lb/>TC123085 (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) that <lb/>encodes full-length cDNA of SEC11L3. The primers used to amplify <lb/>a 216-bp SEC11L3 product are as follows: forward 5  0  -TTGGATA <lb/>TCTTCGGGGACCT-3  0  and reverse 5  0  -GTCTTCCCGGAAATTTGT <lb/>GA-3  0  . The PCR product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector <lb/>using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) to create pCR4-SEC11L3-<lb/>ISH. Positive clones were verified by sequence analysis. The pCR4-<lb/> SEC11L3-ISH plasmid was linearised with PstI for the sense probe <lb/>and NotI for the antisense probe. After removing restriction <lb/>endonucleases, riboprobes were synthesised from 1 mg of template <lb/>DNA and digoxigenin (DIG) were labelled using a DIG RNA <lb/>labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). T3 <lb/>and T7 polymerases were used to synthesise antisense probes and <lb/>sense probes, respectively. DIG incorporation of riboprobes was <lb/>verified by DOT blot with anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments <lb/>(Roche). Antisense and sense riboprobes for SEC11L3 were <lb/>hybridised to 19 tissue sections using the Ventana Discovery <lb/>System with Ventana Ribomap and Bluemap kits. Expression of <lb/> SEC11L3 mRNA in cancer cells was compared to that of non-<lb/>neoplastic epithelial cells (ductal, acinar, intestinal and hepatic <lb/>cells) on the identical specimen and judged using a 0 – 2 score <lb/>(0 ¼ no staining, 1 ¼ weak intensity, 2 ¼ intensity comparable to <lb/>non-neoplastic counterparts). <lb/> Reverse transcription – PCR for SEC11L3 <lb/> cDNAs were synthesised from 1 mg of total RNA using an oligo dT <lb/>primer and the Multiscribe reverse transcription kit (Applied <lb/>Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) as instructed by the <lb/>manufacturer. Reverse transcription was followed by 30 PCR <lb/>cycles (1 min of denaturation at 941C, 1 min of annealing at 551C <lb/>and 1 min of extension at 721C). Primers for SEC11L3 are the same <lb/>as those designed in ISH. Primers for 18S ribosomal RNA, which <lb/>was used as an endogenous control for normalisation, are as <lb/>follows: forward 5  0  -CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3  0  and reverse <lb/>5  0  -CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-3  0  . Amplified products were <lb/>separated on 1% agarose gels and visualised with ethidium <lb/>bromide. <lb/> RESULTS <lb/> Comparison of array CGH profiles in microdissected <lb/>tissues and cell lines <lb/> A total of 23 microdissected PDAC tissues were analysed by array <lb/>CGH. Applying highly stringent statistical conditions (Po0.001), <lb/>we could identify the regions of nonrandom genomic changes in <lb/>PDAC. Figure 1 shows overall copy number changes for each <lb/>chromosome and the entire data set of all clones is available in <lb/>Supplementary Table 1 (the raw data set for all the experiments is <lb/>shown in Supplementary Table 2). A total of 1015 clones met the <lb/>statistical criterion; 17% of clones (508 clones including 698 <lb/>candidate genes) showed genetic gain and 17% (507 clones <lb/>including 1254 genes) showed loss.

			have rarely been observed in cell lines. In contrast, losses of 4q and <lb/>13q and gains of 11q and 20q in cell lines were not as frequent as in <lb/>our microdissected samples. Next, we focused on individual clones <lb/>harbouring the genes that are known to be dysregulated in cell <lb/>lines. Increased copy numbers were detected in the regions <lb/>including MYC (8q24.21) and NCOA3/AIB1 (20q13.12), while <lb/>genetic losses were observed in the regions containing SMAD4 <lb/> (18q21.1), TP53 (17p13.1), MAP2K4 (17p11.2) and RUNX3 <lb/> (1p36.11). However, using the rigorous statistical conditions <lb/>employed, we identified neither genetic gains of KRAS (12p12.1), <lb/> MYB (6q23.3), EGFR (7p11.2) and ERBB2 (17q12) nor losses of <lb/> MLH1 (3p22.2), BRCA2 (13q13.1) and CDH1 (16q22.1). (All the <lb/>genes cited here are depicted in Figure 1.) <lb/> Contiguous regions of nonrandom copy number changes <lb/> In addition to numerous localised alterations, we detected a total <lb/>of 41 contiguous regions (43.0 Mb) of nonrandom genomic <lb/>changes (Table 2). For instance, increased copy number was <lb/>detected in the 26.0 Mb region of 7p22.2 – p15.1 that contains 48 <lb/>known or hypothetical protein-coding genes. We also defined the <lb/>regions of genetic gains on 1q, 3q, 5p, 5q, 8q and 12p, which may <lb/>represent loci for candidate oncogenes in PDAC. The largest region <lb/>of copy number loss was from 17p13.3 to 17p12 (13.6 Mb), which <lb/>covers a total of 53 candidate genes including TP53 (17p13.1) as <lb/>well as MAP2K4 (17p11.2). We delineated three contiguous regions <lb/>of genomic loss on 18q, which is known to be a site of frequent <lb/>deletions in PDAC, 18q21.2 – q22.1 (12.0 Mb), 18q22.3 – q23 <lb/>(7.1 Mb) and 18q12.3 – q21.2 (6.9 Mb). The region of 18q21.2 – <lb/>q22.1 harbours 16 candidate genes in addition to SMAD4 (18q21.1) <lb/>that is one of the most recurrently inactivated tumour suppressor <lb/>genes in PDAC. The region of 18q12.3 – q21.2 contains a total of 23 <lb/>putative target genes, whereas seven genes are included in the <lb/>7.1 Mb region of 18q22.3 – q23. Interestingly, the clone encom-<lb/>passing DCC (18q21.2) has shown an apparent discontinuity <lb/>between two broad regions of genetic loss (18q12.3 – q21.2 and <lb/>18q21.2 – q22.1) in our 23 microdissected PDAC sample set <lb/>(Figure 1). <lb/> Verification of genetic changes by two-colour FISH <lb/> To investigate prospectively whether the identified genetic <lb/>abnormalities are prevalent in PDAC, interphase FISH analysis <lb/>was performed using an independent sample set (Figure 2). <lb/>Previous cytogenetic studies have shown that chromosome arms <lb/>7p and 18q may include oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes <lb/>that play a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis (Griffin et al, <lb/> 1995; Hahn et al, 1995; Fukushige et al, 1997, 1998; Mahlamaki <lb/> et al, 1997; Schleger et al, 2000; Harada et al, 2002a; Iacobuzio-<lb/>Donahue et al, 2004). Therefore, we prioritised three regions <lb/>(7p22.3 – p15.1, 18q12.3 – q21.2 and 18q21.2 – q22.1) of nonrandom <lb/>copy number changes detected in array CGH and a subset of four <lb/>BAC clones (RP11-403N12 at 7p21.1, RP11-232C20 at 7p15.2, <lb/>RP11-8H2 at 18q21.1 and RP11-350K6 at 18q21.32) were selected <lb/>from those regions (Table 3). As shown in Table 4, deletion in the <lb/>locus encompassing SEC11L3 (18q21.32) was observed to be the <lb/>most recurrent alteration (13 out of 19 samples; 68%) (Figure 2B). <lb/>The region 18q21.1 defined by RP11-8H2 was deleted in 11 out of <lb/>19 cases (58%) and contains three known candidate genes: <lb/> ATP5A1, PSTPIP2 and CCDC5. RP11-403N12 including BCMP11 <lb/> (7p21.1) showed an increased copy number in 10 out of 19 cases <lb/>(53%) (Figure 2C), whereas gain of the region at RP11-232C20 <lb/>containing SCAP2 (7p15.2) was demonstrated in seven out of 19 <lb/>cases (37%) (Figure 2D). <lb/> SEC11L3 mRNA downregulation detected by ISH and <lb/>RT –PCR <lb/> Subsequently, the SEC11L3 mRNA level was evaluated by ISH <lb/>(Figure 3). Firstly, we tested several different types of normal <lb/>epithelial cells from the pancreas, intestine and liver. Normal <lb/>pancreatic tissues showed strong mRNA expression of SEC11L3 in <lb/>both ductal and acinar cells (score 2), whereas there was weak <lb/>expression in islet cells (score 1). Strong expression was also <lb/>observed in normal intestinal and hepatic cells (score 2). Of 19 <lb/>PDAC cases, SEC11L3 mRNA was downregulated (score 0 – 1) in 11 <lb/>cases (58%), whereas it was unchanged (score 2) in eight cases <lb/> Table 2 Contiguous regions (43.0 Mb) of chromosomal changes in a total of 23 microdissected PDAC tissues <lb/> Locus <lb/>Start (bp) <lb/>End (bp) <lb/>Size (Mb) <lb/>Mean log2 <lb/>Locus <lb/>Start (bp) <lb/>End (bp) <lb/>Size (Mb) <lb/>Mean log2 <lb/> 1q24.1 – q25.1 <lb/>163 809 021 <lb/>173 127 283 <lb/>9.3 <lb/>0.235 <lb/>1p35.1 – p34.3 <lb/>34 152 076 <lb/>38 379 441 <lb/>4.2 <lb/> À0.232 <lb/> 1q25.2 – q25.3 <lb/>177 942 453 <lb/>181 046 133 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>0.208 <lb/>4p16.2 – p16.1 <lb/>5 094 062 <lb/>8 313 477 <lb/>3.2 <lb/> À0.216 <lb/> 1q31.1 – q31.3 <lb/>187 406 225 <lb/>1 957 10 013 <lb/>8.3 <lb/>0.255 <lb/>6p21.32 – p21.31 <lb/>32 031 967 <lb/>34 013 145 <lb/>4.0 <lb/> À0.219 <lb/> 1q41 <lb/>215 371 867 <lb/>219 919 554 <lb/>4.5 <lb/>0.242 <lb/>6q21 <lb/>108 154 127 <lb/>112 486 834 <lb/>4.3 <lb/> À0.181 <lb/> 1q42.2 – q43 <lb/>231 700 764 <lb/>241 495 322 <lb/>9.8 <lb/>0.253 <lb/>6q25.2 – q25.3 <lb/>155 289 734 <lb/>158 440 778 <lb/>3.2 <lb/> À0.204 <lb/> 2p16.1 – p14 <lb/>60 927 185 <lb/>64 676 357 <lb/>4.8 <lb/>0.171 <lb/>8p22 – p21.3 <lb/>17 784 184 <lb/>21 872 595 <lb/>4.1 <lb/> À0.264 <lb/> 2q22.2 – q22.3 <lb/>143 499 638 <lb/>146 775 971 <lb/>3.3 <lb/>0.168 <lb/>9p24.3 – p24.1 <lb/>190 <lb/>6 659 690 <lb/>6.7 <lb/> À0.228 <lb/> 2q32.1 <lb/>185 140 061 <lb/>188 357 186 <lb/>3.2 <lb/>0.161 <lb/>9p22.1 – p21.3 <lb/>19 310 506 <lb/>23 557 472 <lb/>4.2 <lb/> À0.256 <lb/> 2q32.3 <lb/>192 914 919 <lb/>196 752 218 <lb/>3.8 <lb/>0.146 <lb/>9q22.31 – q22.33 <lb/>94 281 893 <lb/>100 889 311 <lb/>6.6 <lb/> À0.171 <lb/> 3q26.1 <lb/>163 532 324 <lb/>167 501 265 <lb/>4.0 <lb/>0.237 <lb/>9q33.3 – q34.11 <lb/>126 127 921 <lb/>129 390 787 <lb/>3.3 <lb/> À0.216 <lb/> 5p15.31 – p15.2 <lb/>7 449 057 <lb/>10 495 937 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>0.165 <lb/>9q34.13 – q34.3 <lb/>133 982 008 <lb/>137 333 442 <lb/>3.4 <lb/> À0.226 <lb/> 5p14.3 – p14.1 <lb/>20 429 524 <lb/>28 918 008 <lb/>8.5 <lb/>0.232 <lb/>17p13.3 – p12 <lb/>800 495 <lb/>14 360 892 <lb/>13.6 <lb/> À0.252 <lb/> 5q11.1 – q11.2 <lb/>50 061 482 <lb/>54 725 678 <lb/>4.7 <lb/>0.174 <lb/>18q12.3 – q21.2 <lb/>41 216 566 <lb/>48 119 508 <lb/>6.9 <lb/> À0.350 <lb/> 5q12.2 – q13.1 <lb/>63 325 516 <lb/>66 888 015 <lb/>3.6 <lb/>0.149 <lb/>18q21.2 – q22.1 <lb/>49 795 841 <lb/>61 752 947 <lb/>12.0 <lb/> À0.252 <lb/> 5q14.1 – q14.3 <lb/>80 075 105 <lb/>86 472 400 <lb/>6.4 <lb/>0.168 <lb/>18q22.3 – q23 <lb/>68 809 458 <lb/>75 940 259 <lb/>7.1 <lb/> À0.294 <lb/> 5q14.3 <lb/>87 676 680 <lb/>90 964 362 <lb/>3.3 <lb/>0.170 <lb/>21q21.3 – q22.11 <lb/>29 627 040 <lb/>34 602 938 <lb/>5.0 <lb/> À0.182 <lb/> 7p22.2 – p15.1 <lb/>2 607 390 <lb/>28 603 446 <lb/>26.0 <lb/>0.207 <lb/>22q11.22 – q12.1 <lb/>21 400 636 <lb/>25 896 652 <lb/>4.5 <lb/> À0.205 <lb/> 7p14.1 <lb/>38 185 228 <lb/>41 345 287 <lb/>3.2 <lb/>0.170 <lb/>22q12.2-q12.3 <lb/>28 379 384 <lb/>31 627 100 <lb/>3.2 <lb/> À0.180 <lb/> 7q21.11 <lb/>79 539 131 <lb/>83 414 012 <lb/>3.9 <lb/>0.219 <lb/>8q21.11 – q21.13 <lb/>77 234 275 <lb/>81 648 851 <lb/>4.4 <lb/>0.225 <lb/>8q21.13 – q21.3 <lb/>82 640 038 <lb/>89 400 934 <lb/>6.8 <lb/>0.271 <lb/>8q24.11 – q24.13 <lb/>118 297 084 <lb/>123 697 997 <lb/>5.4 <lb/>0.254 <lb/>12p12.3 – p12.1 <lb/>19 403 674 <lb/>23 784 534 <lb/>4.4 <lb/>0.268 <lb/> PDAC ¼ pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. <lb/>

			(42%) (Table 4). All 11 cases with downregulated SEC11L3 <lb/> demonstrated genetic losses by FISH. Despite decreased copy <lb/>numbers, SEC11L3 was expressed in two samples (PC46 and <lb/>PC51). A significant correlation between deletion and expression <lb/>levels was found (P ¼ 0.001, Fisher&apos;s exact test), indicating that the <lb/>mRNA level of this gene was highly dependent on its DNA copy <lb/>number. <lb/>RT – PCR was performed further to confirm downregulated <lb/>mRNA of SEC11L3 in PDAC. Figure 4 shows SEC11L3 expression <lb/>in normal pancreas and PDAC tissue samples. Compared to two <lb/>normal pancreas tissues, SEC11L3 was found to be downregulated <lb/>in 16 out of 16 PDAC samples (100%). In particular, the SEC11L3 <lb/> transcript was virtually almost absent in four PDAC tissues (25%; <lb/>lane 5, 6, 7 and 15). <lb/> DISCUSSION <lb/> It is well known that a strong desmoplastic reaction is a typical <lb/>feature of PDAC tissues. A dense stromal component, which <lb/>occupies larger parts of the tumour mass, significantly reduces the <lb/>sensitivity and specificity of cytogenetic analysis. Tissue micro-<lb/>dissection is laborious, but the practical method available to enrich <lb/>the tumour cell population in clinical specimens. In the present <lb/>study, we first identified genomic abnormalities that represent the <lb/>characteristics of tumour cells in vivo by combining CGH arrays <lb/>with tissue microdissection. This approach led to more precise <lb/>definition of chromosomal breakpoints in a panel of 23 PDAC <lb/>tissue samples. To identify nonrandom genomic changes in PDAC, <lb/>we applied a P-value rather than a fixed cutoff value because <lb/>we found that concomitant lack of power in dichotomising the <lb/>data at an early stage in the analysis provided poor resolution <lb/>with which to distinguish between clones. Taking a statistical <lb/>threshold approach allows us to take account of different clones&apos; <lb/>differing variance across samples that a fixed fold-change <lb/>approach does not. <lb/>We compared the CGH profiles to the previously published cell <lb/>line data (Karhu et al, 2006). Despite overall similar spectrum <lb/>patterns, there were clear differences between both profiles. It is <lb/>important to take into account that the resolution of CGH arrays <lb/>used and the type of statistical analysis employed vary widely <lb/>between the reports. However, our results indicated that some <lb/>recurrent genetic alterations, such as losses of 4q and 13q and <lb/>gains of 11q and 20q, seem to be relatively unique to cell lines, <lb/>implying that these genetic changes may have been artificially <lb/>acquired through the establishment of cell lines or in the course of <lb/>culturing. In addition, our data did not demonstrate significant <lb/>copy number changes of some known genes, such as KRAS, <lb/>ERBB2, MLH1 and CDH1. This is probably due to the fact that <lb/>intragenic mutation or promoter methylation is more likely to <lb/>occur in these genes (Lemoine et al, 1992; Scarpa et al, 1994; <lb/>Rozenblum et al, 1997; Ueki et al, 2000). Alternatively, this <lb/>discrepancy could be explained by the intratumoral heterogeneity <lb/>that is characteristically observed in PDAC cells in vitro as well as <lb/> in vivo, or may reflect the differences of the geographic origin of <lb/>the tumours used in this study (a total of 42 Japanese samples were <lb/> Table 4 The results of FISH and ISH analyses a <lb/> Clone ID/candidate <lb/>RP11-403N12/BCMP11 <lb/>RP11-232C20/SCAP2 <lb/>RP11-8H2/ATP5A1 <lb/>RP11-350K6/SEC11L3 <lb/>Analysis <lb/>FISH <lb/>FISH <lb/>FISH <lb/>FISH <lb/>ISH <lb/> PC37 <lb/>1.05 <lb/>0.99 <lb/> 0.71 <lb/>0.83 <lb/>1 <lb/> PC38 <lb/>1.02 <lb/>1.12 <lb/>0.94 <lb/>0.94 <lb/>2 <lb/>PC39 <lb/>0.98 <lb/>1.09 <lb/>1.05 <lb/> 0.77 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC40 <lb/>1.01 <lb/> 1.30 <lb/> 0.95 <lb/> 0.57 <lb/>1 <lb/> PC41 <lb/>1.13 <lb/>0.93 <lb/> 0.20 <lb/>0.46 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC42 <lb/> 1.28 <lb/>1.18 <lb/>0.56 <lb/> 0.91 <lb/>2 <lb/>PC43 <lb/> 1.23 <lb/> 0.94 <lb/>0.91 <lb/> 0.71 <lb/>1 <lb/> PC44 <lb/> 1.35 <lb/>1.52 <lb/>0.66 <lb/> 0.94 <lb/>2 <lb/>PC45 <lb/>1.01 <lb/>1.01 <lb/> 0.63 <lb/>0.71 <lb/>1 <lb/> PC46 <lb/>1.06 <lb/>1.13 <lb/>0.94 <lb/> 0.86 <lb/> 2 <lb/>PC47 <lb/>0.98 <lb/>1.03 <lb/> 0.74 <lb/>0.36 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC48 <lb/> 1.59 <lb/> 0.94 <lb/>0.90 <lb/> 0.51 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC49 <lb/> 1.17 <lb/>1.24 <lb/>0.58 <lb/> 1.04 <lb/>2 <lb/>PC50 <lb/>1.01 <lb/>1.03 <lb/>0.94 <lb/> 0.63 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC51 <lb/> 1.24 <lb/>1.26 <lb/>0.64 <lb/>0.82 <lb/> 2 <lb/>PC52 <lb/> 1.25 <lb/> 0.97 <lb/> 0.85 <lb/> 1.11 <lb/>2 <lb/>PC53 <lb/> 1.49 <lb/> 1.14 <lb/> 0.71 <lb/>0.70 <lb/>1 <lb/> PC54 <lb/> 1.39 <lb/>1.50 <lb/>0.51 <lb/>0.52 <lb/>0 <lb/> PC55 <lb/> 1.41 <lb/>1.50 <lb/> 0.95 <lb/>1.08 <lb/>2 <lb/>Frequency (%) <lb/>10/19 (53%) <lb/>7/19 (37%) <lb/>11/19 (58%) <lb/>13/19 (68%) <lb/>11/19 (58%) <lb/> a <lb/> Significant differences are outlined in bold.

			analysed by array CGH, FISH and ISH) (Scarpa et al, 1994; <lb/>Gorunova et al, 1998; Harada et al, 2002b). Similarly, deletion <lb/>of the DCC gene was not recurrent in our sample set. However, <lb/>a larger scale of study using much higher-resolution genome-<lb/>wide microarrays (tiling-path CGH arrays or single nucleotide <lb/>polymorphism arrays) is required to conclude whether this <lb/>genetic alteration is critically involved in the pathogenesis of <lb/>PDAC. <lb/>As our array CGH profiles revealed that the regions of 7p22.2 – <lb/>p15.1, 18q12.3 – q21.2 and 18q21.2 – q22.1 are nonrandomly altered, <lb/>four clones from those regions were validated by FISH experi-<lb/>ments. The results showed that genetic alterations for these clones <lb/>were observed in 37 – 68% of tumours in a separate sample set, <lb/>supporting the validity of our CGH results. Moreover, copy <lb/>number changes of those four clones were detected in 18 out of 19 <lb/>PDAC cases (95%), implying the potential clinical applicability. <lb/>Among the candidate genes verified by FISH, BCMP11 is newly <lb/>detected in PDAC, although Fletcher et al (2003) demonstrated <lb/>that mRNA and protein of this gene were overexpressed in <lb/>oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This gene lies adjacent <lb/>to the AGR2 gene (7p21.1) and both genes are classified as <lb/>members of the same family (AGR family) due to highly similar <lb/>(approximately 70%) protein sequences. Interestingly, several gene <lb/>expression analyses have shown that AGR2 is upregulated in the <lb/>majority of PDACs as well as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia <lb/>(PanIN) lesions (Crnogorac-Jurcevic et al, 2003; Iacobuzio-<lb/>Donahue et al, 2003a; Iacobuzio-Donahue et al, 2003b; Missiaglia <lb/> et al, 2004; Buchholz et al, 2005). Taken together, BCMP11 is also <lb/>likely to be involved in the development of PDAC.

			showing that mRNA of this gene is frequently overexpressed in <lb/>PanIN lesions (Buchholz et al, 2005). The protein encoded by this <lb/>gene belongs to the src family of kinases. Takahashi et al (2003) <lb/>demonstrated that SCAP2 functions as a downstream target of <lb/>c-Src under various stress conditions (UV light, tumour necrosis <lb/>factor-a and osmotic stress). Therefore, SCAP2 also seems to work <lb/>as a cell-signalling molecule in cancer cells. However, the <lb/>biological function and putative role of these two genes have not <lb/>been investigated in cancer. <lb/>Remarkably, SEC11L3 was deleted in approximately 70% of <lb/>tumours and its expression level was significantly correlated with <lb/>its DNA copy number. Despite the high frequency of this genetic <lb/>abnormality, this gene has not been described in any type of <lb/>cancer. Previous cytogenetic analyses have revealed a frequent <lb/>deletion of 18q in PDAC, but neither the chromosomal breakpoints <lb/>nor the candidate genes included could be clearly identified due to <lb/>technical limitations of the technology employed (Griffin et al, <lb/> 1995; Hahn et al, 1995; Fukushige et al, 1997, 1998; Mahlamaki <lb/> et al, 1997; Hoglund et al, 1998; Schleger et al, 2000; Harada et al, <lb/> 2002a; Iacobuzio-Donahue et al, 2004). SMAD4 (18q21.1) has been <lb/>reported to be deleted or inactivated in about 50% of PDACs and, <lb/>therefore, it is considered to be one of the most likely candidate <lb/>tumour suppressor genes at this locus (Hahn et al, 1996; <lb/>Rozenblum et al, 1997). However, we propose that SEC11L3 <lb/> (18q21.32) could be an equally promising candidate gene on 18q <lb/>because the significance of genetic loss of this gene is comparable <lb/>to that of the SMAD4 gene. In addition, both ISH and RT – PCR <lb/>independently confirmed that SEC11L3 mRNA is downregulated <lb/>in PDAC tissues at a high frequency (53% and 100%, <lb/>respectively), suggesting that dysregulation of this gene is <lb/>likely to be associated with the development of PDAC. Little is <lb/>known about the biological role of this gene, although it belongs to <lb/>the peptidase S26B family and functions as part of the signal <lb/>peptidase complex. <lb/>In summary, we could successfully identify genetic alterations <lb/>that reflect the intrinsic characteristics of PDAC cells in vivo by <lb/>combining array CGH with tissue microdissection. These results <lb/>provided a valid data set to search for novel candidate genes <lb/>involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis. The specificity of our array <lb/>CGH results was confirmed by interphase FISH in an independent <lb/>sample set. Among the identified candidates, we are particularly <lb/>interested in the SEC11L3 gene that is located on 18q21.32. FISH <lb/>and ISH analyses for this gene demonstrated a significant <lb/>correlation between genetic deletion and the corresponding mRNA <lb/>downregulation, raising the possibility that the SEC11L3 gene may <lb/>play a putative role as a tumour suppressor. For these reasons, we <lb/>propose that SEC11L3 should be considered as a potential marker <lb/>gene for the molecular diagnosis of PDAC and a possible candidate <lb/>target for therapeutic intervention. <lb/>
