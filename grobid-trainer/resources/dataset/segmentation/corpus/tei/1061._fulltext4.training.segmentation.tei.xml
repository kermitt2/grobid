			<body>As (inorganic) solid state chemistry moves forward and contributes <lb/>increasingly to the world of materials science, properties of com-<lb/>pounds are being designed through growing complex compositions. <lb/>Basic binary compounds are thought to be understood Ϫ just text-<lb/>book knowledge! &quot;Simple&quot; iodides such as Sc 0.9 I 2 [1] and PrI 2 [2] <lb/>where composition, crystal and electronic structures and synthesis <lb/>play a strongly interdependent role teach us a different lesson. Fur-<lb/>thermore, it appears to be common thought that compounds of <lb/>fourth and fifth period elements are alike, subject to lanthanide <lb/>contraction [3]. A closer inspection exhibits that this is vaguely the <lb/>case for compounds in their highest oxidation states. <lb/>New halides of lower-valent early transition metals with unusual <lb/>structures (&quot;clusters&quot;) have been the target of intensive research <lb/>already some fifty years ago [4]. Since then their structural chemis-<lb/>try has become monograph and even textbook knowledge [3] and <lb/>it is now believed that these systems are well &quot;understood&quot;. <lb/>According to a (compositionϪtemperature) phase diagram deter-<lb/>mination, the binary tantalumϪiodine system contains three com-<lb/>pounds, TaI 5 , TaI 4 and TaI 2.33 [5]. Crystal structures were deter-<lb/>mined for TaI 5 [6] and for TaI 2.33 ϭ Ta 6 I 14 [7]. These two iodides <lb/>mark the most oxidized and the most reduced tantalum iodides. <lb/>Tantalum(IV) iodide, TaI 4 , was prepared several times by different <lb/></body>

It was assumed that TaI 4 might con-<lb/>tain Ta 2 I 8 dimers similar to NbI 4 [10] which consists indeed of <lb/>chains of edge-sharing Nb 2 I 8 ϭ [NbI 4/2 I 2/1 ] 2 dimers [11]. <lb/>The crystal structure of TaI 4 , however, has not been determined <lb/>previously because single crystals had never been obtained.

			<body>of such halides. From powder diffraction it became clear [5] that <lb/>there might be two modifications of TaI 4 mimicking the assumed <lb/>polymorphism of NbI 4 , but none of these are isostructural with the <lb/>crystal structure of α-NbI 4 [11]. <lb/>Quite recently we had obtained single crystals of K 2 TaCl 6 and of <lb/>K 4 [Ta 6 C1 12 ]Cl 6 through oxidation of the wall of the tantalum reac-<lb/>tion container with vanadium(III) chloride [12], reactions that were <lb/>designed for ternary vanadium chlorides such as KVCl 3 . In a simi-<lb/>lar incident, during a reaction of RbI, PrI 3 , Pr and graphite in a <lb/>sealed tantalum container we have obtained a minor amount of <lb/>black well-developed single crystals of TaI 4 attached to the wall of <lb/>the tantalum container [13]. <lb/>The crystal structures of all transition metal tetraiodides MI 4 which <lb/>were characterized by X-ray crystal structure analyses [11, 16] con-<lb/>sist of metal octahedra sharing edges in different ways to infinite <lb/>chains 1 <lb/>ϱ [MI 4/2 I 2/1 ], see also [17].

			<body>ted octahedral chains [11]. (Note that in ThI 4 ϭ [ThI 8/2 ] square <lb/>antiprisms are face-and edge-connected [18]). <lb/>Crystal Structure of TaI 4 <lb/>According to our crystal structure determination [19], tanta-<lb/>lum(IV) iodide, TaI 4 , does indeed form dimers as was assumed <lb/>previously [3, 4, 8]. But they differ remarkably from the dimers in <lb/>NbI 4 . The TaI 6 octahedra do not share common edges. Rather, two <lb/>TaI 6 octahedra are connected via a common face which brings <lb/>the tantalum atoms much closer together, at a distance of only <lb/>297.5(1) pm. The face-sharing octahedra of the composition <lb/>[(TaI 3/2 I 3/1 ) 2 ] ϭ TaI 4.5 must be linked further to allow for the com-<lb/>position TaI 4 . Connection via common vertices would lead to a <lb/>chain as in β-ReCl 4 (below) [20]. Connection via one common edge <lb/>leads to a tetramer Ta 4 I 16 (Fig. 1). Connectivities are as follows: <lb/>I 3/1 Ta2(I 3/2 ) 2 Ta1I 1/1 (I 2/2 ) 2 I 1/1 Ta1(I 3/2 ) 2 Ta2I 3/1 ϭ Ta 4 I 8/1 (I f <lb/>6/2 I e <lb/>2/2 ) 2 ϭ <lb/>Ta 4 I 16 ϭ TaI 2/1 I 4/2 ϭ TaI 4 . <lb/></body>

			<body>The crystal structure of TaI 4 may also be described in terms of an <lb/>ABAC closest packing of iodide spheres in which one fourth of the <lb/>octahedral interstices are occupied such that the just-mentioned <lb/>tetramers are built, which are isolated from each other. <lb/>In the Ta 4 I 16 molecules, the non-bonding Ta-Ta distance through <lb/>the common edge is 439.5(1) pm, much the same as the non-bond-<lb/>ing Nb-Nb distance in NbI 4 (436 pm) [11]. With 297.5(1) pm <lb/>through the common face of three iodide ions, the TaϪTa distance <lb/>is very close to the mean value of the twelve octahedral edges as <lb/>observed in Ta 6 I 14 , 292.3 pm [7b] and with the unbridged Ta-Ta <lb/>attractions in the pentameric (NH 4 ) 6 [{Ta 5 (NH) 4 }]Cl 17 [21], <lb/>293.2(1) pm. The only other tetrahalide which contains face-shar-<lb/>ing octahedra is ReCl 4 in the so-called β polymorph [20]. The <lb/>double octahedra with ReϪRe distances of 272.8(2) pm share, how-<lb/>ever, two common vertices resulting in a chain structure. <lb/>Electronic Structure of TaI 4 <lb/>With one 5d electron per Ta 4ϩ , the TaϪTa distances of 297.5(1) pm <lb/>through the common faces in the tetrameric Ta 4 I 16 molecules in <lb/>TaI 4 may be associated with the formation of two TaϪTa σ bonds, <lb/>or, in other words, two two-center-two-electron bonds as suggested <lb/>in Fig. 1. Extended Hückel Molecular Orbital calculations [22] for <lb/>the molecular Ta 4 I 16 unit essentially support such a localized in-<lb/>terpretation although there are two degenerate HOMOs, which <lb/>correspond to two four-center-two-electron orbitals as depicted in <lb/>Fig. 2. The LUMOs are still bonding and it might, therefore, be <lb/>possible to further reduce TaI 4 . However, there is a considerable <lb/>energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs. This picture of the <lb/>electronic structure of TaI 4 is confirmed by DFT-LMTO-ASA cal-<lb/>culations for the bulk [23]. Here, a HOMO-LUMO separation of <lb/>about 0.4 eV is found as illustrated by the density of states (DOS, <lb/>Fig. 2). States below the Fermi level are dominated by iodine-p <lb/>contributions whereas the empty states above can be mainly attri-<lb/>buted to Ta-d states. The crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations <lb/>(COHP) for Ta-Ta interactions clearly show strongly bonding and <lb/>well localized Ta-Ta bonds, Figure 2. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>We have serendipitously obtained single crystals of TaI 4 during a <lb/>reaction that was designed for Rb{Pr 6 C 2 }I 12 through a reaction <lb/>with the tantalum container. The crystals must have formed in an <lb/>unknown way during the cooling process because TaI 4 does not <lb/>exist in equilibrium above 398°C [5]. Powder X-ray diffraction data <lb/>previously recorded of a sample that was obtained by reduction of <lb/>TaI 5 with aluminium [5] are identical with those calculated from <lb/>the present single-crystal X-ray data, see Fig. 3. Accordingly, TaI 4 <lb/>has an unprecedented molecular tetrameric structure which makes <lb/>it also reasonable that it is able to form complexes with pyridine <lb/>[5] whose structures are so far unexplored. TaI 4 , however, obtained <lb/>through decomposition of its pyridine complexes, has a different <lb/>crystal structure. Assumptions that TaI 4 has the same crystal struc-<lb/>ture as NbI 4 [24] based on powder diffraction data of a tantalum <lb/>&quot;subiodide&quot; which gave a green aqueous solution [8] had already <lb/>been disposed. Both TaI 4 modifications prepared either by alu-<lb/>minium reduction or by decomposition of the pyridine complex <lb/>&quot;hydrolyzed rapidly with formation of a hydrous brown oxide&quot; [5]. <lb/>Thus, our present work represents the first determination of the <lb/>crystal structure (of one modification) of tantalum(IV) iodide. <lb/></body>

For iodine 6s, 5p, 5d and 4f orbitals were con-<lb/>sidered as valence orbitals and 6s, 5d and 4f were downfolded. <lb/>To examine in detail the effect of different atoms on the elec-<lb/>tronic density of states, the partial (l and m quantum number <lb/>decomposed) electronic density of states has been calculated. <lb/>These were calculated by projecting the wave functions onto <lb/>spherical harmonics centered on each atom. For bond analysis <lb/>the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) method <lb/>is used together with its integration, the ICOHP [R. Dron-<lb/>skowski, P. E. Blöchl, J. Phys.
