        <front>Abstract: <lb/>This study investigated the effects of addition of Italian ryegrass with multi-enzyme on growth performance, fecal <lb/>odor, and microbiome. The experiment had a two-factor factorial design, using three levels of Italian ryegrass <lb/>(0%, 2.5%, and 5%) and two levels of multi-enzymes (no enzyme and commercially recommended level) to <lb/>formulate experimental diets. In total, 60 crossbred LYD pigs (88.35 ± 2.57 kg) were allocated into six dietary <lb/>treatments with five replicates. After four weeks, fecal samples were collected via rectal massage for microbiome <lb/>and odorous compound analysis. Results showed no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in growth performance, except <lb/>for feed intake (p&lt;0.05), which was higher in enzyme-added diets. Fecal microbiome exhibited no differences <lb/>(p&gt;0.05) between treatments, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes being the major phyla, similar to the general pig <lb/>population. Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed no significant differences (p&gt;0.05). Odorous compounds <lb/>displayed no significant differences (p&gt;0.05), except for indoles (p&lt;0.05) influenced by the enzyme. In conclusion, <lb/>5% Italian ryegrass with multi-enzymes can be used as an alternative feed ingredient, having no negative effects <lb/>on the growth performance, microbiome, and odorous compounds of growing pigs. <lb/>Keywords: growth performance, Italian ryegrass, manure odor, microbiome, NSP enzyme <lb/></front>

        <body>Introduction <lb/>The demand for alternative feed ingredients is increasing due to unstable costs of universal feed ingredients, <lb/>such as corn and wheat, caused by unstable international situations such as continuous climate change and wars. <lb/>In those circumstance, feed formulators should have considered the various alternatives which has low nutrient <lb/>value or has high price. Thus, we were focused on Italian ryegrass as an alternative feed ingredient for pig. <lb/>Ryegrass has two major species, Lolium perenne, also called English ryegrass and Lolium multiflorum Lam., also <lb/>called Italian ryegrass. Italian ryegrass (IRG) has good characteristics which high-yielding, rapid seedling <lb/>establishment, weed suppression, and palatable forage that is tolerant to various environmental conditions [1, 2]. <lb/>Even in 2004, a new cold-tolerant and early-heading variety of IRG called &quot;Kogreen&quot; was developed to be suitable <lb/>in Korean seasonal conditions [3]. Generally Italian ryegrass regarded as good ingredient for ruminant without <lb/>affecting negative effect on the animal. Recent research also suggests that Hanwoo fed Italian ryegrass improves <lb/>carcass yield 12.5% higher than control diet [4]. However, there is limited research on IRG diets for non-ruminant <lb/>animals due to their high fibers. Despite the characteristics of fibers in monogastric animal diet which generally <lb/>regarded as an anti-nutritional actor because of its lower protein level and energy digestibility, fibers could <lb/>improve gut health with by-product from bacteria which increasing gut length, mass, and villus height [5]. Non-<lb/>starch polysaccharide (NSP), some portion of dietary fibers, in diet is also generally considered as anti-nutritional <lb/>factors for non-ruminant animals because of their characteristics which encapsulate nutrients intracellularly and <lb/>cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes of non-ruminant animals [6]. NSPs also have cation exchange <lb/>capacity, hydration properties, viscosity, and organic compound absorptive properties at animal digestive tract [7]. <lb/>Because of the characteristics of NSP, Choct, Dersjant-Li [8] suggests that NSP in diet, especially for young <lb/>monogastric animals, NSP decrease the nutrient digestibility, proliferation of E. coli causing swine dysentery and <lb/>dehydration of NSP could reduce negative effects of NSP. Therefore, previous dietary NSP studies focused on <lb/>mitigating the effects of NSPs by adding NSP enzymes, and this addition is suggested to have expected and <lb/>unexpected health benefits for swine in NSP diets [9]. Following studies, Li, Feng [10] suggests weaning pig fed <lb/>high barley contained diet with NSP enzymes could improves growth performance and increase gamma GT <lb/>activity in jejunal mucosa and Ao, Meng [11] suggests growing pig fed corn-soy based diet with multi NSP <lb/>enzymes improve average daily gain, G:F, and improve digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and amino acids. <lb/>Besides, the microbiome is also crucial for its host animals, as it can provide various benefits that the host lacks <lb/>due to its genetic diversity [12]. Animals are born without microbial contamination; however, they are continually <lb/>exposed to microbes due to their gastrointestinal structure, which resembles an open tube [13]. Therefore, feed <lb/></body>

        <body>ingredients consumed by animals are important for shaping the gut microbial community. However, research of <lb/>IRG in the monogastric animal diet is very limited. Research by Recharla, Kim [14] suggests that IRG, with <lb/>exogenous enzyme addition, has no impact on growth performance and nutrient digestibility; however, it affects <lb/>the microbial composition in the hindgut. Park, Cho and Hwang [15] propose that adding a maximum of 1.5% <lb/>IRG to swine diets can reduce odorous compounds in manure by altering the microbial community, while <lb/>maintaining consistent growth performance. <lb/>Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate the availability, tolerance level, and effects of IRG with NSP <lb/>enzyme supplementation on growth performance, gut microbiome, blood parameter, and manure odor emission <lb/>in finisher pigs. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Italian ryegrass evaluation <lb/>Following AOAC methods (2005), samples were initially pre-dried at 60°C in a drying oven and ground. <lb/>The feed ingredient was assessed for gross energy using a bomb calorimeter (Model C2000, IKA, Germany), ether <lb/>extract, crude fiber, ash, NDF, and ADF (acid detergent fiber) (Holst, 1973). Calcium was determined using an <lb/>atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer 3300, Perkin Elmer, USA). Phosphorus content in the feed <lb/>ingredients, experimental diets, and feces was measured using a spectrophotometer (Optizen 2120 UV, Mecasys, <lb/>Republic of Korea). The calculated composition of IRG was as follows: 1,447.25 kcal/kg metabolizable energy, <lb/>12.1% crude protein, 3.6% ether extract, 22.3% crude fiber, 0.2% phosphate, and 0.4% calcium. <lb/>Experimental diet, design, and animal housing <lb/>Six experimental diets were formulated and fed to the animals. The diets consisted of two enzyme levels <lb/>(non and recommended) and three dietary IRG levels (0%, 2.5%, and 5%). All experimental diets were formulated <lb/>to match equal nutrient levels of ME and CP. The formulation and calculated values of experimental diets are <lb/>presented in Table 1. In total, 60 crossbred LYD (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) pigs were used to assess the <lb/>effects of dietary IRG and multi-enzyme addition. Multi-enzymes were added to the diet to achieve the <lb/>commercially recommended level (255 U/kg cellulase; 1,250 U/kg beta-mannanase; 6,000 U/kg xylanase). The <lb/>pigs were randomly assigned to six dietary treatments (two enzyme levels × three IRG levels), with each treatment <lb/>replicated five times, and each pen containing two pigs. The average body weight of the allocated pigs was 88.35 <lb/></body>

        <body>± 2.57 kg. All pigs are allotted with completely randomized block design. The experiment lasted for four weeks, <lb/>during which the experimental diet and fresh water were provided ad libitum via metal troughs and nipple drinkers. <lb/>Sample collection and analyses <lb/>Growth performance data were collected to determine the effects of IRG and multi-enzymes present in the <lb/>diet on finisher pig. All measurements were taken on a pen basis. Initial and final body weights were recorded on <lb/>the first and last days of the experiment. Average daily feed intake was determined by measuring the total feed <lb/>consumption. Average daily gain and feed efficiency were calculated using the measured body weights and feed <lb/>intake. <lb/>Fecal samples were analyzed to estimate the effects of IRG and multi-enzymes on fecal microbiome and <lb/>odorous compounds. Fecal samples were collected from the anus after rectal massage and stored in a -80°C deep <lb/>fridge with 50-mL conical tube. <lb/>A G-spinTM genomic DNA extraction kit was used to extract genomic DNA from fecal samples. The <lb/>processed DNA was analyzed using 16S rRNA [16]. All processed sequences were clustered at a 97% similarity <lb/>threshold using QIIME (v.1.8.0). The alpha diversity of the microbiome at the IRG level was assessed by <lb/>calculating ASVs, Chao1, Shannon, and Gini-Simpson diversity indices, whereas beta diversity was evaluated <lb/>using the Bray-Curtis distance, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was employed to visualize it. <lb/>Fecal volatile fatty acids, phenols, and indoles were analyzed following the procedure described by <lb/>Flickinger, Schreijen [17]. Volatile fatty acids were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, 6890N, Agilent, <lb/>USA). Phenols and indoles were extracted by mixing 2 g of feces with 5 mL of methanol containing 2,000 ppm <lb/>of 5-chloroindole (internal standard). The feces-methanol mixture was sealed with parafilm, thoroughly mixed, <lb/>and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with frequent mixing. Thereafter, the tubes were centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 20 min <lb/>at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The remaining pellet was mixed again with 5 mL of methanol and <lb/>extracted as described above. The two supernatant fractions were combined for gas-liquid chromatography <lb/>analysis. The individual concentrations of indole, phenol, p-cresol, and 4-ethylphenol were determined using a <lb/>gas chromatograph (GC, 6890N, Agilent, USA). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>All collected and calculated data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS 26.0 <lb/>(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The pen and individual pig were considered the statistical unit for growth <lb/></body>

        <body>performance analysis and manure analysis, respectively. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In cases <lb/>where significant differences were found, Tukey&apos;s post hoc test was employed to examine the differences between <lb/>the groups. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Table 2 shows the impact of dietary IRG and multi-enzymes on growth performance. Initial BW, final BW, <lb/>ADG, and FE (feed efficiency) showed no significant differences in terms of p-value, IRG, enzyme, or interaction <lb/>effects. However, ADFI had a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05), with enzymes influencing it. Exogenous <lb/>carbohydrase enzymes are considered enhancers, improving energy availability and nutrient digestibility by <lb/>breaking down indigestible bonds in swine diets. They may also enhance intestinal microbiomes, potentially <lb/>improving host health [18-20]. Previous research suggests that adding NSP-degrading enzymes to swine diets can <lb/>boost feed intake [21, 22]. Combining these enzymes with others can enhance swine diet performance more <lb/>effectively than using only one type of enzyme [23]. Our results align with previous studies indicating that <lb/>exogenous NSP-degrading enzymes increase feed intake. However, no significant differences in any growth <lb/>performance parameters were observed until IRG was added at a 5% level. In general, ingredients with higher <lb/>fiber content are considered to have lower nutritional value for non-ruminants because fibers cannot be broken <lb/>down by the host animal&apos;s endogenous enzymes [24]. Previous studies also agreed that a high fiber diet can <lb/>negatively affect the growth performance of pigs at various growth stages [25-28]. However, the effect of dietary <lb/>fiber on growth performance remains controversial. Some research suggests that high fiber diets decreases growth <lb/>performance in growing pigs but have a limited effect on finisher pigs [29, 30], whereas other studies propose that <lb/>high fiber diets have no impact on growing pigs [31, 32]. There are very limited results of IRG in swine diet; <lb/>however, these suggest that a small amount of IRG does not affect the growth performance [14, 15]. Agyekum, <lb/>Sands [28] also suggests that the conflicting results of high fiber effects on swine does not depend only on the <lb/>fiber amount, such as CF, NDF, ADF, and NSP, but on the ratio between the fiber components. The absence of <lb/>interaction effects between IRG and enzymes may be due to the limited role of 5% IRG as an anti-nutritional <lb/>factor in the diet. <lb/>Taxonomic assignment at the phylum level, alpha diversity, and beta diversity are analyzed and illustrated <lb/>in Figures 1 to 3 to check the effect of dietary fibers on the gut microbiome. According to Kim, Borewicz [33], <lb/>the majority of bacteria can be classified into five phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <page>8 <lb/></page>

        <body>and Spirochaetes, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes making up 90% of the bacterial population. These phyla are <lb/>known to interact with resistant starch [34], and Bacteroidetes possess high carbohydrate enzyme gene activity <lb/>for breaking down plant cell wall components like glucuronoxylans, xyloglucans, and pectin [35]. As reported by <lb/>Patil, Gooneratne and Ju [36], the addition of dietary NSP stimulates the commensal microbiome to produce short-<lb/>chain organic acids, lowering the gut pH. Consequently, we aimed to investigate potential changes in microbiome <lb/>diversity with the addition of dietary IRG. Alpha diversity analysis employed ASVs, Chao1, Shannon, and Gini-<lb/>Simpson methods. However, our results did not indicate any significant differences in alpha diversity. Similarly, <lb/>beta diversity showed no significant distinctions between the groups. Agyekum and Nyachoti [5] suggested about <lb/>the ambivalence of the dietary fiber in swine gut which even in the same soluble fiber research which some are <lb/>suggests that soluble fiber in swine diet contribute the risk of colibacillosis and swine dysentery by colonized <lb/>pathogenic bacteria caused by the low viscosity but the others research are not. Zhang, Tun [37] also suggested <lb/>that NSP enzyme addition did not impact alpha diversity in growing pigs. Consequently, the results of this study <lb/>suggested that 5% IRG in the diet with NSP enzymes can be managed without negatively altering microbial <lb/>composition. The results of the analysis of fecal odorous compounds are shown in Table 3. Fecal odorous <lb/>compounds analysis was decided because of believes that the dietary NSP could affect the gut microbiome. The <lb/>major odorous compounds in swine manure are volatile organic compounds, indoles, and phenols [38-40]. <lb/>Furthermore, whether microbiomes affected by substrates in diet, the major end-products in manure are acetate, <lb/>propionate, and butyrate [41]. Based on a previous research, volatile fatty acids produced by Eubacterium and <lb/>Clostridium are the major contributor to odorous compounds. However, various studies presented that the gut <lb/>microbiome is affected by dietary ingredients, especially fibers [42-44]. Additionally, the gut microbial <lb/>metabolism of tryptophan results in the production of indole compounds [45]. Therefore, IRG with additional <lb/>multi-enzymes could possibly change the odorous compounds by reducing the precursor of volatile organic <lb/>compounds, but no significant difference was observed, except for the indole level influenced by the enzyme. We <lb/>speculate that this result arises from the degradation of the fiber structure, leading to the release and utilization of <lb/>entrapped nutrients. From those results, we suggest that adding 5% IRG in finisher pig diets can help achieve the <lb/>desired goals without negatively impacting the growth performance. Also adding enzymes in high fiber diet can <lb/>also enhance feed intake and reduce indole compounds by degrading the fiber source. <lb/>In conclusion, 5% IRG with multi NSP enzymes could be an option for replacing corn in swine diet and <lb/>following research which set the maximum IRG level without affecting growth performance and benefits of <lb/>replacing IRG to corn by economic analyzing are required <lb/></body>
