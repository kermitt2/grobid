        <front>ORIGINAL RESEARCH <lb/>The Efficacy of Adalimumab in Children with Chronic <lb/>Non-infectious Posterior Uveitis and Panuveitis: <lb/>A Retrospective Cohort Study <lb/>Tianyu Tao . Shizhao Yang . Daquan He . Xuening Peng . <lb/>Zhenyu Wang . Qi Jiang . Tianfu Wang . Wenru Su <lb/>Received: August 9, 2023 / Accepted: September 6, 2023 / Published online: March 18, 2024 <lb/>Ó The Author(s) 2024 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Introduction: This study aimed to assess the <lb/>efficacy and safety of adalimumab in pediatric <lb/>patients with chronic non-infectious posterior <lb/>uveitis and panuveitis (not associated with <lb/>juvenile idiopathic arthritis). <lb/>Methods: The medical records of children <lb/>(\ 18 years old) with chronic non-infectious <lb/>posterior uveitis and panuveitis were collected <lb/>and analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. <lb/>Children were allocated to a conventional <lb/>adalimumab-free <lb/>treatment <lb/>(CT) <lb/>or <lb/>adalimumab (ADA) group based on whether <lb/>they additionally received adalimumab. <lb/>Results: In total, 69 children (138 eyes) were <lb/>included, with 21 (42 eyes) and 48 (96 eyes) in <lb/>the CT and ADA groups, respectively. During <lb/>the average follow-up period of 24 months, the <lb/>improvement in all ocular parameters (best-<lb/>corrected visual acuity, intraocular inflamma-<lb/>tion, fluorescein angiography score) was better <lb/>in the ADA group than in the CT group, except <lb/>for changes in central macular thickness, which <lb/>did not significantly differ between the groups. <lb/>The mean time of first alleviation, which was <lb/>after 1.03 ± 0.12 months of therapy, was earlier <lb/>in the ADA group than in the CT group <lb/>(2.30 ± 0.46 months). In the ADA group, 90.6% <lb/>of children had remission within 3 months, and <lb/>47.9% had no relapse during follow-up. Cough <lb/>and cold were the most common adverse events <lb/>in the ADA group; however, the number of <lb/>adverse events was similar between both the <lb/>groups. <lb/>Conclusions: Adalimumab was effective in the <lb/>treatment of chronic noninfectious posterior <lb/>uveitis and panuveitis in pediatric patients, and <lb/>disease inactivity was accomplished in the <lb/>majority of the patients, thereby improving <lb/>visual outcomes and maintaining disease sta-<lb/>bility. Adverse events were limited and <lb/>tolerable. <lb/>Keywords: Adalimumab; Biologics; Intraocular <lb/>inflammation; Pediatric uveitis; Treatment <lb/>Tianyu Tao and Shizhao Yang contributed equally to <lb/>this work and should be regarded as co-first authors. <lb/>T.

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Pediatric uveitis is a severe inflammatory eye <lb/>disease that results in vision loss in one-third of <lb/>patients, eventually leading to permanent <lb/>blindness [1]. More severe complications in <lb/>idiopathic pediatric uveitis require special con-<lb/>siderations [2]. The most commonly identified <lb/>cause of pediatric uveitis is juvenile idiopathic <lb/>arthritis (JIA), presenting mostly as anterior <lb/>uveitis. However, few studies have focused on <lb/>non-JIA uveitis [3, 4]; moreover, research on <lb/>improving treatment options for pediatric <lb/>posterior uveitis or panuveitis is lacking, which <lb/>is often chronic, persistent, and threatens <lb/>vision. <lb/>The goal of pediatric uveitis treatment is <lb/>controlling inflammation and achieving <lb/>stable remission [5]. Topical, peribulbar, or sys-<lb/>temic corticosteroids are used as a first-line <lb/>treatment, <lb/>usually <lb/>combined <lb/>with <lb/>immunomodulatory agents (IMTs), such as <lb/>methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and <lb/>mycophenolate mofetil [6]. However, this can <lb/>result in severe adverse effects not only con-<lb/>cerning ocular conditions, such as cataracts and <lb/>glaucoma, but also physical and mental health <lb/>in children [5]. Randomized controlled trials <lb/>(RCTs) have demonstrated the success of bio-<lb/>logical therapy for JIA-associated uveitis mostly <lb/>in pediatric patients [7-9], and meta-analyses <lb/>have investigated administering anti-tumor <lb/>necrosis factor (TNF)-a drugs for childhood <lb/>chronic uveitis [10, 11]. Therefore, switching to <lb/>biotherapy in the early stages of uveitis has <lb/>recently been considered. <lb/>Anti-TNF-a agents are the most widely used <lb/>biotherapies for noninfectious uveitis (NIU). <lb/>Among these, adalimumab (ADA) is the most <lb/>effective [12] and has the advantage of less <lb/>autoreactive antibodies and higher drug <lb/>responses because its human monoclonal anti-<lb/>body acts against TNF-a [13, 14]. Since ADA was <lb/>approved by the Food and Drug Administration <lb/>(FDA) in 2018 as a second-line therapy for <lb/>uveitis in children ([ 2 years old), the evidence <lb/>of its efficacy in pediatric uveitis has accumu-<lb/>lated. ADA may represent a valid alternative in <lb/>children with anterior refractory uveitis, with <lb/>similar efficacy for JIA, idiopathic uveitis, and <lb/>systemic disorders such as Behc ¸et&apos;s disease (BD) <lb/>[15]. However, there is a paucity of research on <lb/>the efficacy of ADA in pediatric uveitis involv-<lb/>ing posterior inflammation, characterized by <lb/>few case studies and limited assessment <lb/>methodologies. Therefore, we conducted this <lb/>retrospective cohort study to assess the efficacy <lb/>and safety of ADA in the treatment of chronic <lb/>pediatric posterior uveitis and panuveitis com-<lb/>pared to conventional ADA-free treatment (CT). <lb/></body>

        <body>METHODS <lb/>Patient Selection <lb/>This retrospective cohort study was conducted <lb/>in pediatric patients with non-infectious uveitis <lb/>treated at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center <lb/>between March 2019 and September 2022 <lb/>(Fig. 1). This study was performed according to <lb/>the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and <lb/>was approved by the ethics committee of the <lb/>Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (No. 2019058). <lb/>Written informed consent was obtained from <lb/>each patient and/or their caregivers. Before <lb/>treatment, patients were screened for tubercu-<lb/>losis, syphilis, and hepatitis. <lb/>The inclusion criteria were: (1) an onset of <lb/>non-infectious uveitis before 18 years of age; (2) <lb/>diagnosis by uveitis-trained ophthalmologists <lb/>according to the Standardization of Uveitis <lb/>Nomenclature working group guidelines for <lb/>posterior uveitis or panuveitis [16]: inflamma-<lb/>tion observed in the retina combined with or <lb/>without inflammation in the anterior chamber, <lb/>vitreous, or choroid, including retinitis, retinal <lb/>vasculitis, or papillitis; (3) no previous use of <lb/>biological agents, especially anti-TNF-a drugs; <lb/>and (4) regular follow-ups for at least 12 months <lb/>after treatment. Patients with associated sys-<lb/>temic disease, diabetes, ocular infection, <lb/>trauma, or retinitis pigmentosa were excluded. <lb/>Drug Use and Follow-up <lb/>The patients were assigned to two groups (ADA <lb/>and CT) according to whether they additionally <lb/>received adalimumab. Apart from the conven-<lb/>tional treatment, the ADA group received a <lb/>double dose of ADA (HUMIRA; AbbVie Inc., <lb/>North Chicago, IL, USA) for the first time at the <lb/>initial treatment. One week after the first <lb/>injection, 40-mg doses were administered by <lb/>subcutaneous injection every other week, and <lb/>the dose was halved in children weigh-<lb/>ing B 30 kg. The interval could be prolonged in <lb/>patients who remained stable for 1 year with no <lb/>active inflammation confirmed upon slit-lamp <lb/>examination. Relapse was suppressed by repe-<lb/>ated injections of a double dose of ADA. <lb/>In the CT group, as in the basic treatment in <lb/>the ADA group, patients were administered oral <lb/>glucocorticoids (GC) at baseline (1-2 mg/ <lb/>kg/day) and all patients underwent a mandatory <lb/>GC taper upon decreased intraocular inflam-<lb/>mation starting in week 2. Repeated high doses <lb/>of systemic oral GC followed by slow tapering <lb/>suppressed rebound inflammation in relapsed <lb/>patients. Supplemental periocular steroid injec-<lb/>tions could be administered to treat critical <lb/>anterior and posterior segment inflammation. <lb/>Clinical visits were scheduled at screening, <lb/>baseline (biological therapy initiation), at weeks <lb/>1, 2, and 4, and approximately every 4 weeks <lb/>thereafter; visits were conducted every 2 weeks <lb/>for patients in an active phase or relapse. ADA <lb/>was discontinued in the ADA group or biologi-<lb/>cal therapy was initiated in the CT group in the <lb/>case of frequent recurrence of anterior chamber <lb/>inflammation or massive retinal leakage (fluo-<lb/>rescein angiography [FA]) or the appearance of <lb/>systemic adverse events. <lb/>Fig. 1 Study flow diagram illustrating the patient selection <lb/>process; NIU non-infectious uveitis, ZOC Zhongshan <lb/>Ophthalmic Center, CT conventional treatment, ADA <lb/>adalimumab, GCs corticosteroids, IMTs immunomodula-<lb/>tory treatment <lb/></body>

        <body>Data Collection <lb/>The standard tests included best-corrected <lb/>visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular inflammation, <lb/>specialty ocular examination for central macu-<lb/>lar thickness (CMT), and posterior inflamma-<lb/>tion scores, as assessed with FA at the beginning <lb/>of ADA as the baseline and subsequently <lb/>monthly standard tests, such as 3-months ocu-<lb/>lar coherence tomography (OCT) and 6-months <lb/>FA after starting ADA. Moreover, information <lb/>on the number of relapses, IMT reduction, GC-<lb/>sparing effects, and systemic disorders were <lb/>retrospectively collected and analyzed. The <lb/>details are as follows: <lb/>• Visual acuity: The logarithm of the mini-<lb/>mum angle of resolution (logMAR) was used <lb/>to assess BCVA. The &apos;&apos;counting finger/hand <lb/>motion/light perception&apos;&apos; was converted to a <lb/>quantified visual acuity value [17]. <lb/>• Intraocular inflammation: The Nussenblatt <lb/>scale and Standardization of Uveitis Nomen-<lb/>clature Working Group schema were used to <lb/>assess the degree of vitritis and anterior <lb/>chamber inflammation, respectively [16]. <lb/>The definition of alleviation of inflamma-<lb/>tion included patients who achieved either <lb/>complete absence of inflammation or C 2-<lb/>step decrease in inflammation (anterior <lb/>chamber score and vitreous haze score) or <lb/>slight remnants (0.5 ? anterior chamber <lb/>cells). Relapse of uveitis was defined as a <lb/>new flare or aggravation of uveitis, including <lb/>a two-step increase in the inflammation level <lb/>of anterior chamber cells and/or vitreous <lb/>haze or an increase from grade 3 ? to 4 ? , <lb/>retinal vasculitis, optic disc, or macular <lb/>edema. <lb/>• CMT: CMT was defined as the average retinal <lb/>thickness within a 1-mm-diameter region in <lb/>the macular fovea measured using Cirrus <lb/>High-Definition-OCT (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, <lb/>Germany). <lb/>• FA scores of posterior inflammation: oral or <lb/>intravenous FA examination was performed <lb/>at baseline and every half year following <lb/>ADA administration. Angiography Scoring <lb/>for Uveitis Working Group scoring was used <lb/>to assess posterior inflammation in FA <lb/>images [18]. To minimize errors, FA scores <lb/>were evaluated by two specialists (TTY and <lb/>YSZ). In the case of a dispute, the final <lb/>decision was made by the senior specialist <lb/>SWR. <lb/>• IMT reduction and GC-sparing effects: A <lb/>corticosteroid-sparing effect was defined as <lb/>complete withdrawal from systemic corticos-<lb/>teroid therapy while maintaining clinical <lb/>stability. <lb/>• Systemic disorder: Routine blood examina-<lb/>tions and liver and renal function tests were <lb/>performed every 2 months. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Mean ± standard deviation and median (in-<lb/>terquartile range) were used for continuous <lb/>parameters and numbers (%) were used for cat-<lb/>egorical parameters. The Shapiro-Wilk test and <lb/>histograms were used to assess the normality of <lb/>continuous data. Normally distributed variables <lb/>are reported as mean (standard deviation) and <lb/>were compared using the Student&apos;s t test, while <lb/>non-normally distributed variables are summa-<lb/>rized as median (interquartile range) and were <lb/>compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. For <lb/>categorical parameters, groups were compared <lb/>using the chi-squared test or Fisher&apos;s exact test. <lb/>Survival curves were constructed using the <lb/>Kaplan-Meier method. SPSS software 16.0 <lb/>(NCSS, LLC, USA) was used for analysis. P val-<lb/>ues \ 0.05 were considered statistically signifi-<lb/>cant. All significance values were two-tailed. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Patient Characteristics Before Treatment <lb/>Initiation <lb/>In total, 69 patients (138 eyes) with chronic <lb/>non-infectious posterior uveitis and panuveitis <lb/>were included, with 21 (42 eyes) and 48 (96 <lb/>eyes) patients in the CT and ADA groups, <lb/>respectively.

        <body>this study has the highest number of cases <lb/>dedicated exclusively to non-infectious pedi-<lb/>atric posterior uveitis and panuveitis. It offers <lb/>the distinct advantage of encompassing a well-<lb/>defined control group, thereby enhancing the <lb/>robustness of the study. In this study, during an <lb/>average follow-up period of 24 months, <lb/>improvement in all ocular parameters (BCVA, <lb/>intraocular inflammation, FA score) was better <lb/>in the ADA group than in the CT group, except <lb/>for improvements in CMT, which did not differ <lb/>between the groups. The mean time of first <lb/>alleviation often occurred earlier in the ADA <lb/>group than in the CT group. There were signif-<lb/>icantly fewer relapses and more GC-free patients <lb/>in the ADA group at the final follow-up visit. <lb/>Moreover, the number of adverse events was <lb/>similar between the groups. Cough and cold <lb/>were the most common adverse events observed <lb/>in the ADA group. <lb/>Systemic JIA was one of the most common <lb/>causes of pediatric uveitis and the only FDA-<lb/>approved disease for which ADA could be <lb/>administered in children before 2018, studies <lb/>on the effectiveness of ADA have focused on <lb/>pediatric anterior uveitis associated with JIA, <lb/>such as the SYCAMORE and ADJUVITE RCTs <lb/>[19, 20]. After ADA was approved for patients <lb/>aged [ 2 years with uveitis, a small number of <lb/>studies further supported the use of ADA in <lb/>children [3, 4, 21]. Deitch et al. [4] first studied <lb/>the effects of anti-TNF-a agents on outcomes of <lb/>pediatric uveitis of diverse types, including 20 <lb/>(46.5%) cases of panuveitis. The rates of <lb/>achievement of the inactive state and success <lb/>were 23.3% and 46.5%, respectively, during <lb/>1 year of treatment with ADA or infliximab. <lb/>Kouwenberg et al. [3] demonstrated that treat-<lb/>ment with ADA led to prompt inactivity of non-<lb/>JIA uveitis in the majority of children (90.6%), <lb/>whereas this study included 15 (35%) and eight <lb/>(18.6%) patients with anterior and intermediate <lb/>uveitis, respectively. Another study that inclu-<lb/>ded the largest number of panuveitis cases (28 <lb/>patients, 90%) demonstrated that anterior and <lb/>posterior inflammation reached inactivity after <lb/>4 weeks in all cases [21]. Although these studies <lb/>included children with varying anatomies and <lb/>etiologies of uveitis, the results were consistent <lb/>with our findings. <lb/>Our study demonstrated that ADA was <lb/>effective in children with chronic posterior <lb/>uveitis and panuveitis, with 90.6% attaining <lb/>remission after 3 months, which was consistent <lb/>with previous studies [3, 21] including anterior <lb/>uveitis cases. In our study, 46 eyes achieved <lb/>symptom alleviation without relapse during <lb/>follow-up. This suggested that, within 9--<lb/>43 months of follow-up, 52.9% of the patients <lb/>achieving an early response maintained a per-<lb/>sistent state of inactivity. This proportion was <lb/>much higher than that reported in studies of <lb/>chronic pediatric uveitis mostly with JIA, which <lb/>reported a pooled response rate of 56.3-84.5% <lb/>[9, 20, 22]. This could be attributed to the ade-<lb/>quate use of concomitant immunosuppressants <lb/>in our study, which may have reduced the <lb/>production of anti-ADA antibodies and main-<lb/>tained the response to ADA [23].

        <body>compared to other anti-TNF-a therapies [8]. The <lb/>patients in our study were all undergoing their <lb/>first biologic treatment, and 16.7% were treat-<lb/>ment-naive. Notably, this variance in treatment <lb/>response may stem from the potential differ-<lb/>ences between NIU and JIA, which could be <lb/>considered distinct entities in terms of their <lb/>responses to ADA in children. <lb/>There is little evidence regarding when to <lb/>withdraw biologic treatments for pediatric <lb/>uveitis. Guidelines recommend at least 2 years <lb/>of well-controlled immunomodulatory therapy <lb/>before tapering in children with JIA uveitis [24]. <lb/>However, the duration of suppression main-<lb/>tained for over 1.5 years with ADA did not sig-<lb/>nificantly affect the likelihood of reactivation <lb/>[25]. Likewise, the 5-year outcomes of the <lb/>SYCAMORE trial revealed that drug-induced <lb/>remission of JIA uveitis did not persist when <lb/>ADA was withdrawn after 1-2 years of treatment <lb/>[19]. Retrospective studies have documented <lb/>that frequent uveitis recurrence was corelated <lb/>with prolonged drug withdrawal, older age at <lb/>uveitis onset, and shorter time to achieve per-<lb/>sistent <lb/>inactivity <lb/>following <lb/>treatment <lb/>[19, 26, 27]. Interestingly, idiopathic uveitis <lb/>may have a better prognosis than JIA uveitis due <lb/>to the higher probability of maintaining remis-<lb/>sion following ADA discontinuation [27]. This <lb/>suggested that JIA and idiopathic uveitis may be <lb/>different and should be discussed separately. <lb/>However, the exact duration of ADA treatment <lb/>has not been defined for these two uveitides. <lb/>Therefore, in our study, a treatment period of <lb/>2 years was maintained for patients who did not <lb/>develop complications. The first phase-4 RCT <lb/>(NCT03816397) <lb/>is <lb/>currently <lb/>recruiting, <lb/>Fig. 3 A successful case of panuveitis treated with <lb/>adalimumab; A 12-year-old boy with chronic non-infec-<lb/>tious panuveitis; FA and fundus photography before <lb/>adalimumab injection (A), fern-like appearance alleviated <lb/>with less optic disc edema after 1 year (B).

        <body>assessing the feasibility of discontinuing ADA in <lb/>adults and children with quiescent uveitis [28]. <lb/>Although ADA alleviates pediatric uveitis <lb/>activity (even up to the level of complete qui-<lb/>escence), it does not exclude the possibility of <lb/>relapse. In our study, the ADA group could <lb/>maintain <lb/>alleviation <lb/>for <lb/>approximately <lb/>9.7 months longer than the CT group. A total of <lb/>52.1% of patients treated with ADA experienced <lb/>at least one relapse during follow-up, although <lb/>this was fewer than the number of relapses in <lb/>patients treated with CT (90.5%). Uveitis relapse <lb/>occurred in five (26%) patients without an <lb/>identifiable cause and in 14 (33%) with an <lb/>identifiable cause in a similar retrospective <lb/>study of patients with non-JIA chronic uveitis <lb/>[3]. However, the reason for flare-ups following <lb/>ADA therapy remains unclear. Although ADA <lb/>has a relatively lower uveitis recurrence rate <lb/>than other anti-TNF biologics [10, 29], regular <lb/>ophthalmic monitoring of children with uveitis <lb/>is recommended, even in cases of stable poste-<lb/>rior inactivity and panuveitis. <lb/>Adverse events requiring discontinuation of <lb/>therapy were more common in children treated <lb/>with CT than in those treated with ADA. How-<lb/>ever, 16 children in the ADA group (33.3%) <lb/>experienced adverse events, including common <lb/>cold (12.5%), nausea/vomiting (8.3%), rash/ <lb/>eczema (6.3%), fatigue (6.3%), growth retarda-<lb/>tion (4.2%), and weight fluctuation (2.1%). No <lb/>deaths, malignancies, demyelinating diseases, <lb/>serious infections, or lupus-like reactions were <lb/>observed during ADA exposure. Only one child <lb/>discontinued ADA owing to serious eczema. Our <lb/>results coupled with the reports previously <lb/>published in the literature suggest the safety of <lb/>the use of ADA in children with uveitis [3, 30]. <lb/>Moreover, the blood test results in the children <lb/>treated with ADA were similar to those in the <lb/>children in the CT group, which mostly showed <lb/>elevated liver function enzymes. In all the cases, <lb/>adjustment of conventional IMTs and admin-<lb/>istration of liver-protecting Chinese herbs <lb/>resulted in transient abnormal blood test <lb/>results. Therefore, ADA may be well tolerated in <lb/>children with uveitis, with an acceptable side-<lb/>effect profile. <lb/>Another important finding in our study was <lb/>the prompt response time, which was 4 days in <lb/>the CT group and 1 week in the ADA group. <lb/>Notably, until 3 weeks after the initial treat-<lb/>ment, the remission rate in the ADA group <lb/>exceeded that in the CT group. Sonmez et al. <lb/>demonstrated that intraocular inflammation <lb/>significantly improved within 4 weeks, and vit-<lb/>reous haze decreased in the fourth week and <lb/>stabilized in the 12th week [21]. ADA has a <lb/>delayed onset of action and can require up to a <lb/>few weeks to regulate inflammation. Little is <lb/>known about the timing of effects of ADA in <lb/>uveitis; however, lag has been seen in the onset <lb/>of biologics in other rheumatic diseases [31]. <lb/>Therefore, periocular and pulse steroid therapy <lb/>is indispensable, especially in children with <lb/>uveitis who require regulation of ocular <lb/>inflammation to prevent vision-threatening <lb/>complications. Therefore, more rigorous early <lb/>follow-up studies are warranted. <lb/>To date, several before-after cohort studies <lb/>have attempted to identify the efficacy of ADA <lb/>in chronic non-infectious or non-anterior <lb/>uveitis in children [3, 4, 21, 30]; but the data <lb/>have lacked control groups for the maintenance <lb/>of other IMTs and FA assessment, which are <lb/>used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of <lb/>posterior uveitis. Although the samples and <lb/>focuses have been slightly different, these <lb/>studies showed CMT thinning and reduction of <lb/>systemic IMTs in children receiving ADA. <lb/>However, ADA demonstrated no significant <lb/>advantage over CT in reducing macular edema <lb/>and increasing GC-sparing effects; even the rate <lb/>of disappearances of macular edema were 77.8% <lb/>(14/18) to 86.7% (13/15) in a similar study, <lb/>lower than that seen herein [3, 30]. We also <lb/>highlighted that ADA should be administered <lb/>for a certain amount of time to ensure effects in <lb/>children with NIU. Consequently, our study <lb/>provided comprehensive and compelling evi-<lb/>dence concerning the effects and characteristics <lb/>of ADA in children with chronic non-infectious <lb/>posterior uveitis and panuveitis. <lb/>Our study had certain limitations, such as its <lb/>single-center design, lack of objective and <lb/>quantified inflammation indicators, and lack of <lb/>a prospective, randomized, masked, and con-<lb/>trolled clinical trial design. However, certain <lb/>observations herein can be useful owing to the <lb/>paucity of reports on ADA for noninfectious <lb/></body>

A <lb/>larger, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to <lb/>conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of ADA <lb/>therapy in childhood uveitis, and not only in <lb/>JIA-associated anterior uveitis. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>This study demonstrated that ADA was effective <lb/>and tolerated in pediatric patients with non-<lb/>infectious posterior uveitis and panuveitis. <lb/>Although ADA showed no superior advantage <lb/>over CT in reducing macular edema, GC-spar-<lb/>ing, and the speed of remission at early onset, it <lb/>could significantly improve long-term visual <lb/>acuity, stabilize ocular inflammation, and <lb/>ensure a high remission rate in children with <lb/>non-infectious posterior uveitis and panuveitis. <lb/></body>
