			<body>Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) is a key figure of the Renaissance 1,2 . His constant search for novelty allowed him <lb/>to develop new painting techniques he was the only one to master, such as the famous sfumato 3 . However, while <lb/>the exceptional pictorial results obtained by Leonardo can still be admired today, he left no precise indications <lb/>on the recipes he used to achieve them. 500 years after the completion of his artworks, only chemical analysis <lb/>can reveal the materials and secrets of the Master 4-6 . <lb/>Painted between 1503 and Leonardo&apos;s death in 1519, the St. Anne (Fig. 1) is considered one of his ultimate <lb/>masterpieces along with the Mona Lisa. The painting is in the collection of the Musée du Louvre and was studied <lb/>in the framework of its restoration at the Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France (C2RMF) in <lb/>2007 7 . In this context, several microsamples were collected to help in deciphering the materials and techniques <lb/>of Leonardo. Among those samples, one was taken from the composition background, near the frontier between <lb/>the brown rocky landscape and the mountains appearing in a blue haze (white arrow in Fig. 1). <lb/>The optical image of the stratigraphy of this sample (Fig. 2a) shows that the blue hue of the paint was achieved <lb/>using a very small amount of coloring material: only a few particles of ultramarine (a blue pigment composed <lb/>of the mineral lazurite) were dispersed in an almost entirely white layer (layer β). SEM-EDX allowed to detect <lb/>also a few grains of silicates and red lake pigments. This layer was painted on top of the imprimitura (layer α) <lb/>solely composed of white material in oil. A ground layer of gesso is present under the imprimitura. Finally, a layer <lb/>with a more complex composition-notably containing earth and copper pigments, quartz, lead-tin yellow and <lb/>alumino-silicates-was painted on top (layer γ). The white material present in both layers was identified as lead <lb/>white, one of the most widely used pigments in easel paintings prior to the twentieth century. <lb/>Lead white is composed of a mixture of two crystalline phases 8 , namely cerussite (C) PbCO 3 , and hydrocerus-<lb/>site (HC) Pb 3 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 2 . In aqueous media, the formation of the two phases is pH-dependent: C being stable <lb/>in an acidic (pH &lt; 6), and HC in an alkaline (8 &lt; pH &lt; 10) environment 9 .

			<body>Renaissance was based on the dry corrosion of metallic lead by vinegar vapors (containing acetic acid) in the <lb/>presence of CO 2 , O 2 and H 2 O 10 . Lead carbonates (C and HC) were formed at the surface of lead foils, then col-<lb/>lected and sold to painters. As the same synthesis process (often referred to as stack process) was used since antiq-<lb/>uity, one might expect to find a nearly identical material throughout works of art. However, historical sources <lb/>reveal that the obtained raw material could be modified by the paint manufacturers or the painters themselves. <lb/>Numerous post-synthesis treatments were thus used. According to the degree of sophistication of the fabrication <lb/>process of the pigment, different qualities were obtained and sold at various prices to the painters before being <lb/>mixed with the organic binder and employed in a painting 11,12 . Unfortunately, Leonardo, as his contemporaries, <lb/>never revealed what materials he used in his artworks. The sample of the St. Anne with its two adjacent β and α <lb/>lead white layers thus appears as a unique opportunity to provide new clues into Leonardo&apos;s technique, and the <lb/>possible perceptive effects he wanted to achieve. <lb/>Today, quantifying the ratio of the two constitutive phases of lead white appears to be the most efficient way <lb/>to provide clues on the pictorial choices of the Old Masters 13 . Until recently, the only method used to achieve <lb/>this was X-ray diffraction (XRD). In particular, synchrotron-generated X-ray micro-beams allow to quantify <lb/>those compounds inside micrometric cross-sections 14 . However, radiation damage due to long acquisition times <lb/>and the need to use synchrotron facilities pose serious challenges for analysis on precious historical samples. In <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>a recent study, it was shown that HC and C can also be discriminated on the basis of their photoluminescence <lb/>(PL) properties upon excitation in the deep-UV (5 eV, 250 nm) 15 . Still, due to complex emission behaviors, the <lb/>ability to discriminate lead white phases based on PL has so far not been demonstrated in a micro-imaging <lb/>application. This work demonstrates how semi-quantitative information can be obtained on the lead white com-<lb/>position in the different paint layers of the Ste. Anne microsample by employing deep-UV excited hyperspectral <lb/>photoluminescence microspectroscopy and a dedicated spectral unfolding procedure. Beyond the investigation <lb/>of Leonardo&apos;s painting technique, an important goal of this work was to establish photoluminescence-through <lb/>validation with synchrotron-XRD-as a viable non-invasive tool for the spatially resolved characterization of <lb/>lead white in historical microsamples. <lb/>Results <lb/>Synchrotron high-angle resolution X-ray diffraction (SR-HR-XRD). Two fragments about <lb/>50-80 µm in size were collected from layers α and β of the St. Anne sample for XRD analysis at the ID22 beam-<lb/>line (ESRF, Grenoble, France). One fragment is made of pure layer β, while the other is made primarily of the <lb/>imprimitura layer α. It must be noted that this second sample also contains a minor part of layer β, as was con-<lb/>cluded from the detection of small amounts of lazurite. These two fragments will be hereafter referred to as the <lb/>β fragment and α fragment, respectively. <lb/>Zooms of the diffractograms collected on the α and β fragments in the angular range 4.5 ≤ 2θ (°) ≤ 6.5 are <lb/>shown in Fig. 2c. Here, due to the low amount of lead white pigment in layer β, the diffraction pattern of the β <lb/>fragment exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio than the one of the α fragment. <lb/>The full XRD patterns with corresponding Rietveld refinements are given in Supplementary Information. <lb/>The quantitative phase analysis of XRD diagrams (Fig. 2c) shows the prevalence of cerussite in the β fragment <lb/>(R = HC/(HC + C) = 46 ± 2 w%) and of hydrocerussite in the α fragment (R = HC/(HC + C) = 65 ± 2 w%). How-<lb/>ever, taking into account that the α fragment is contaminated by some β component, the actual HC content of <lb/>the former is likely to be somewhat higher than the experimental value. For the sake of realism, the standard <lb/>uncertainties have been multiplied by Bérar&apos;s factor 16 computed by FullProf. <lb/>In addition to layer compositions, HR-XRD can provide information about the average morphologies of lead <lb/>white crystallites. The broadening of a diffraction peak β = FWHM − FWHM ins , where FWHM ins is the instrumen-<lb/>tal width, can be considered as the sum of size and strain-induced contributions β L and β S . Assuming β L = 0.9λ/ <lb/>Lcosθ (&quot;Scherrer broadening&quot; formula) and β S = 4ε tanθ (from the logarithmic differentiation of Bragg&apos;s law), <lb/>where λ is the wavelength, θ the Bragg&apos;s angle, L the mean crystallites size perpendicular to the corresponding <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>(hkl) planes, and ε the strain coefficient, the broadening of diffraction peaks are given by the Williamson &amp; Hall&apos;s <lb/>(WH) linearized form 17 : <lb/>By plotting β cosθ = f (sinθ), the crystallites size L and the strain coefficient ε can be inferred from the <lb/>y-intercept and from the slope, respectively. In the case of anisotropic crystals like HC, straight lines can only <lb/>be plotted from reflections of the same plane at different orders n (nh nk nl series). The crystal geometry can <lb/>then be rebuilt by reporting the corresponding L lengths along the planes&apos; perpendicular directions. The WH <lb/>analysis of the HC phase in the α layer (Fig. 3a) allows to determine the morphology of the average crystallite <lb/>as a platelet 110 ± 20 nm thick, with a 10:1 aspect ratio (Fig. 3b) and a low and quasi-isotropic strain coefficient <lb/>ε = 4.7 ± 0.2 × 10 -4 computed from reflections of different orders. Implementing this procedure proves more deli-<lb/>cate for HC in layer β because of the low lead white content of this layer, but the peak widths are not significantly <lb/>different. Concerning C, the dispersion of the experimental points is not apparently ruled by the orthorhombic <lb/>symmetry, but maybe by the twinning commonly observed in this structure that results in a slight Lorentzian <lb/>broadening. Fitting the whole diagram with a single straight line yields a near-zero Scherrer broadening, cor-<lb/>responding to C particles larger than 500 nm (see Supplementary Information). <lb/>Synchrotron deep UV-excited photoluminescence (SR-µ-PL). Having measured differences in the <lb/>HC content of the α and β fragments by SR-HR-XRD, the possibilities of SR-µ-PL spectroscopy and imaging to <lb/>determine lead white compositions throughout the whole St. Anne cross-section was explored. Figure 2d shows <lb/>an average spectral fit of the PL spectrum in layer β, excited at 5 eV. This photon energy corresponds to the <lb/>3 <lb/>P 1 (6s6p) ← 1 S 0 (6s 2 ) transition of Pb 2+ ions 15,18 . The superposition of six transitions with Gaussian profiles (cen-<lb/>tered at 1.85 eV, 2.03 eV, 2.32 eV, 2.51 eV, 2.94, and 2.97 eV) was necessary to give a satisfactory fit. It was previ-<lb/>ously shown that the excitation of lead white at 5 eV produces emission with very large Stokes shifts, centered at <lb/>2.8-2.9 eV for C and at 2.0-2.1 for HC 15 . Both emissions were attributed to ligand-to-metal (CO 3 -to-Pb) charge <lb/>transfer transitions 15,19 . Thus, we attribute the PL bands at 2.03 eV (green curve on Fig. 2d) and 2.94 eV (blue <lb/>curve on Fig. 2d) to emission of HC and C, respectively. The weak red emission at 1.85 eV is at the lower limit <lb/>of the experimental spectrum and is typical of the 4 T 1 → 6 A 1 emission of Mn 2+ impurities, which occurs around <lb/>1.9 eV in cerussite 20 . Considering the images shown in supporting information (Fig. S3) the emission of the PL <lb/>band at 2.32 eV was found to spatially correlate to that of the band at 2.03 eV. This means that the emission band <lb/>at 2.32 can likely also be attributed to HC, together forming the broad emission feature centered around 2.15 eV <lb/>that was previously found by Gonzalez et al. on pure hydrocerussite samples 15 . <lb/>Finally, without any other plausible origin, the bands at 2.51 and 2.97 eV (two rightmost orange curves in <lb/>Fig. 2d) were attributed to the oxidized drying oil binding medium. The two main arguments are (1) the knowl-<lb/>edge that drying oils do exhibit photoluminescence in the visible 21,22 and (2) the observation that the emission <lb/>intensity of these two bands is distributed more or less homogenously throughout the three paint layers (see <lb/>supporting information, Fig. S3). <lb/>The amplitudes of the Gaussian bands at 1.85, 2.03 and 2.94 eV were mapped out, intensity stretched, and <lb/>combined into a false-color RGB image, displayed in Fig. 2b. Chemical contrast between the different layers can <lb/>clearly be visualized: the bottom layer α exhibits a green signature dominated by the 2.03 eV emission of HC, <lb/>whereas the middle layer β exhibits a blue signature dominated by the emission band of C at 2.94 eV (Fig. 2b). <lb/>The HC and C content per layer could not be quantified directly by PL, due to a lack of information about <lb/>the quantum yields and molecular absorption coefficient of cerussite and hydrocerussite. However, a metric Γ <lb/>is proposed that still allows to relate the unfolded photoluminescence emission amplitudes to the HC content <lb/>R = HC/(HC + C). The emission amplitude A C at 2.94 eV for cerussite (and similarly A HC at 2.03 eV for hydrocer-<lb/>ussite) is proportional to the quantum yield Φ C , the molecular absorption coefficient ε C at the excitation photon <lb/>energy 5 eV, and the concentration [C], i.e. A C ∝ � C ε C [C] .

			<body>are the same in layers α and β for a given lead white component (HC or C), the ratio between emission ampli-<lb/>tudes in the two different paint layers does not depend anymore on Φ and ε, and is equal to the ratio between <lb/>the concentrations of C in the two layers: <lb/>The same equation holds for hydrocerussite, where the subscript C is replaced by HC. Based on this relation, <lb/>the metric Γ is then defined as follows: <lb/>The value Γ ≈ 2.1 is obtained from the average photoluminescence emission amplitudes of layers α and β (see <lb/>supporting information). Γ is also related to the HC content R measured by HR-XRD by: <lb/>The values Γ ≈ 2.1 derived from hyperspectral SR-µ-PL (Eq. 3) and Γ ≈ 2.2 derived from HR-XRD (Eq. 4) <lb/>are sufficiently similar to validate our interpretation of PL data and to confirm that layer α is dominated by HC <lb/>while layer β is dominated by C. The ~ 5% difference in Γ between XRD and PL may be due to a number of fac-<lb/>tors, including deviations in the assumption that ɸ and ɛ are the same in layers α and β, and an imprecise spatial <lb/>definition of those two layers in the hyperspectral PL maps. A table recapitulating the ratios obtained with both <lb/>techniques, SR-HR-XRD and SR-µ-PL for layers α and β is available in supporting information (Table S1). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The combined HR-XRD and SR-µ-PL analysis revealed that the St. Anne sample contains two layers with dif-<lb/>ferent lead white compositions. This observation raises questions about what the intention of the artist could <lb/>have been for using two varieties of lead white. Previous analyses of HC and C compositions in a large corpus of <lb/>Italian Renaissance paintings from the Louvre Museum revealed that in most cases, lead white pigments of this <lb/>period made by the historical stack process exhibited R = HC/(HC + C) values in the range 60 ≤ R ≤ 80 (w%) and <lb/>large average particle sizes 14 . This was corroborated by a reconstruction of the synthesis process used in the past, <lb/>yielding the same composition range 60-80 (w%) 10 Extending the composition range to R &lt; 50 (w%) required a <lb/>very long corrosion time and an increased CO 2 supply, which is limited in the stack process. R &gt; 80 (w%) could <lb/>be obtained by collecting the pigment before complete consumption of lead, as HC appears and grows before C <lb/>during the corrosion process 10 . To obtain pigments deviating from the most usual composition range 60 ≤ R ≤ 80 <lb/>(w%) and with small particle size, the raw material had to be post-processed by the pigment manufacturer or in <lb/>the painter&apos;s workshop, which must therefore be the result of a conscious choice. <lb/>A diagram showing the thickness L HC of HC crystallites as a function of the lead white composition is shown <lb/>in Fig. 4. The data previously collected from 24 samples from Renaissance paintings 14 are represented by the <lb/>colored areas in the diagram: in yellow, the primary stack process; in blue, the various secondary post-process <lb/>(2) <lb/>(A C ) β <lb/>(A C ) α <lb/>= <lb/>[C] β <lb/>[C] α <lb/>(3) <lb/>Ŵ ≡ <lb/>[HC] [C] α <lb/>[HC] [C] β <lb/>= <lb/>A HC <lb/>A C α <lb/>A C <lb/>A HC β <lb/>(4) <lb/>Ŵ ≡ <lb/>[HC] [C] α <lb/>[HC] [C] β <lb/>= <lb/>(R/(1 − R)) α <lb/>(R/(1 − R)) β <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>treatments. Experimental points for layers α and β of the St. Anne sample are shown in red, both falling in a region <lb/>indicating some form of post-synthesis treatment to obtain crystallites of smaller dimensions. <lb/>Ancient recipes indicate two possible ways of obtaining a pigment with submicrometric crystallites: wash-<lb/>ing of the pigment in vinegar or levigation in water. Regarding the first post-synthesis method-consisting in <lb/>washing or grinding the lead white in vinegar-historical sources highlight it was a well-attested process during <lb/>the Renaissance that was said to render the pigment &apos;whiter&apos; 23,24 . This increased whiteness is most likely due <lb/>to the dissolution of the remaining non-corroded dark metallic lead particles in an acidic environment. This <lb/>acidic treatment also induces the partial dissolution of HC crystallites (and the decrease of their size) and the <lb/>subsequent precipitation of C, which is more stable in this pH domain. The size of the reprecipitated C particles <lb/>is also small due to the fast crystallization process 10 . This results in a lead white with R &lt; 50 (w%) and an average <lb/>particle size in the submicrometer range that is highly polydisperse. For that reason, we were unable to estimate <lb/>the size of the finest fraction by XRD. The second post-synthesis method consisted in segregating the particles <lb/>according to their size by levigation in water, without chemical reaction (Fig. 4). This method is not expected to <lb/>significantly alter the composition of the obtained lead white batch. From Fig. 4 we can therefore conclude that <lb/>the lead white pigment in layer β was certainly submitted to an acidic treatment. <lb/>The question now becomes whether or not Leonardo da Vinci could have had access to different lead white <lb/>pigments and used them according their specific qualities and properties. Did he buy the lead whites and then <lb/>treat them himself, or did he buy the two varieties directly from a pigment provider? It is difficult to answer this <lb/>question. However, the idea of the use by Leonardo of a lead white that was treated post-synthesis to produce a <lb/>whiter or &quot;higher&quot; grade of pigment is backed up by notes found in the Arundel 263 notebook by Da Vinci, on <lb/>the recto of folio 228, British Library (Fig. 5) 4 Here, he lists orders for two different lead whites-one of which <lb/>is 30% more expensive. This order by the Master for two lead white pigments at two different prices constitutes <lb/>to our knowledge the earliest mention of distinct lead white qualities in Italian Renaissance history, and gives <lb/>a proof that Leonardo was using different lead white grades. If this hypothesis is correct, one can imagine that <lb/>untreated-or &quot;lower&quot; grades pigments without post-synthesis treatment (R &gt; 60w%)-would typically be found <lb/>in imprimitura layers, whereas the treated, or &quot;higher&quot; grades (R &lt; 50 w%) pigments would be found in the upper <lb/>layers of the painting that are visible to those observing the finished painting. This is in line with the observed <lb/>HC contents in layers α (imprimitura) and β. <lb/>We formulate here two hypotheses to explain the choice by Leonardo to use a lead white with very fine <lb/>particles: The first hypothesis is related to the specific rheological properties Leonardo must have looked for. <lb/>Particle size is indeed a key parameter regarding the rheological properties of lead white paints, as exemplified in <lb/>several works 23,25 . Leonardo is very renowned for his use of extremely thin and subtle glaze paint layers. In order <lb/>to achieve a thin glaze layer, a painter must use a very fine pigment granulometry: this was notably stressed by <lb/>Leonardo himself 4 for the ochre pigment. MA-XRF elemental maps on the entire corpus of da Vinci artworks <lb/>from the Louvre recently highlighted how ochre and lead white pigments were the materials of choice used by <lb/>the Master to achieve the progressive tone gradients in his flesh tones 4 . We can thus safely assume that he was <lb/>looking for pigments with very small particle sizes to achieve those effects in his pictorial layers, in this case <lb/>the β layer of the Ste Anne. The second hypothesis is related to the scattering properties of lead white and their <lb/>relation to the size of the crystallites. Considering the micrometric and submicrometric dimensions of the lead <lb/>white crystallites, Mie scattering is expected to be the dominant scattering process 26,27 . Mie scattering is more-<lb/>or-less wavelength-independent, so it does not affect the color of the pigment. Still, polydisperse lead whites <lb/>with a submicrometric average particle size (such as the one used in layer β of the St. Anne sample), contain <lb/>Figure 5.

			<body>a certain fraction of crystallites that have dimensions significantly smaller than the wavelength of visible light <lb/>(&lt; 100 nm). These crystallites will induce Rayleigh scattering: a process which depends on the wavelength as λ −4 , <lb/>causing blue light to be scattered much more efficiently than red light. A demonstration of how a grade of lead <lb/>white with a submicrometric average crystallite size can exhibit significant Rayleigh scattering is shown in Fig. 6. <lb/>HC mixed with linseed oil was spread on calibrated test paper with controlled thickness. Two different subtypes <lb/>of lead white were selected: the first composed of large size crystallites (&gt; 20 µm), the other of submicrometric <lb/>crystallites (&lt; 400 nm). It was observed that the pigment composed of small particles possessed a strong blue <lb/>hue, observable in the reflectance spectra (Fig. 6). This result clearly shows an evident optical effect of crystal-<lb/>lite size for HC. Still, as the average lead white crystallites-even those in the finer grades-are not expected to <lb/>exhibit significant Rayleigh scattering, polydispersity will strongly affect the light scattering properties of a batch <lb/>of lead white. Therefore, two scenarios are proposed, based on the extent to which the lead white in layer β is <lb/>polydisperse and exhibits Rayleigh scattering. <lb/>The first scenario is related to the common observation that typical lead whites have a slightly off-white <lb/>appearance with a relatively low reflectance towards the shorter wavelengths 28 . Slightly increasing the Rayleigh <lb/>scattering properties of a batch of lead white could have the effect to increase the observed whiteness of the <lb/>pigment, which may be desirable for obtaining certain pictorial results. In case of a more significant Rayleigh <lb/>scattering-related effect, the lead white used in layer β may in fact have exhibited a distinct blue hue, similar <lb/>to what is shown in Fig. 6. For this alternative scenario, it is relevant to consider the location from which the <lb/>analyzed sample was taken. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the sample comes from the foothills of a mountain range <lb/>of which especially the most distant sections appear slightly blue. In fact, the hue of these distant mountains is <lb/>very similar to the blue hue in which Da Vinci painted the sky. <lb/>In the MS. Leic.-a manuscript written c. 1506-1510-Da Vinci expresses (folio 4r) a very early understand-<lb/>ing of how this blue color of the sky is related to the presence of particulate matter in the atmosphere: &quot;I say that <lb/>the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic color, but is caused by warm vapor evaporated in minute and <lb/>insensible atoms on which the solar rays fall, rendering them luminous […]&quot;. He then continues by proposing a <lb/>simple experiment to mimic this effect with lead white: &quot;let him paint a board with various colors, among them <lb/>an intense black […] if he puts on it a very fine and transparent layer of ceruse, he will see that the white of this <lb/>ceruse will actually be a beautiful blue, but it has to be very fine and well ground. &quot; It is therefore possible that Da <lb/>Vinci used a post-processing method in order to give the distant objects in his painting a blue hue according <lb/>to exactly the same physical phenomenon that would make them appear blue in the real world. A connection <lb/>can thus be proposed between the observation Leonardo made of the natural surroundings, his theory on color <lb/>diffusion in the atmosphere, and the processing and selection of his artistic materials. <lb/>To see that the idea of painters using Rayleigh scattering to obtain certain pictorial results is not as far-fetched <lb/>as it may seem, it is interesting to note that the use of a lead white with blue hue scattering properties was previ-<lb/>ously also hypothesized in Dutch Golden Age paintings 29 -although no experimental results were presented. <lb/>Moreover, a recent macro X-ray diffraction (MA-XRD) analysis permitted to identify a cerussite-rich subtype <lb/>of lead white in a specific area of Vermeer&apos;s Girl with a Pearl Earring 30 which was also hypothesized to have been <lb/>used in order to obtain specific optical effects. Possibly painters could have observed that washing their pigment <lb/>in vinegar, in addition to cleaning it from impurities, also gave it a cold blue hue, particularly suited for subtle <lb/>optical effects. A detailed investigation of the artistic materials needed to obtain such blue hues through Rayleigh <lb/>scattering was reported by Checroun et al. 31 . <lb/>Figure 6. Reflectance spectra of two lead white layers (thickness of 60 µm) com-posed respectively of <lb/>sub-micrometric (&lt; 400 nm) and large (&gt; 20 µm) HC crystallites. The sub-micrometric pigment exhibits a <lb/>pronounced decrease of reflectance toward the red region of the visible range, whereas the pigment composed of <lb/>large crystallites exhibits a nearly constant and high reflectance on the entire visible range. The insets represent <lb/>the images of HC grains, and the blue hue of the film composed of the finer grade. <lb/></body>

			<body>Based on the results presented in this paper, an outlook is here proposed that includes four distinct prospec-<lb/>tives. First, it would be of interest to study complementary samples from Leonardo&apos;s paintings to assert whether <lb/>this specific subtype of lead white was used in comparable paint areas where a blue hue was also desirable. <lb/>Second, a thorough fundamental PL study of the various inorganic/organic components of ancient paint layers <lb/>would provide much-needed insight on the interpretation of the data gathered on complex historical samples. <lb/>While this was recently initiated for the lead white pigments, the PL properties of many other pigments are still <lb/>not investigated. Third, in terms of instrumental development, it is important to mention that, due to increased <lb/>commercialization of deep-UV emitting sources, the development of lab-based micro-imaging systems operating <lb/>below 250 nm are now foreseeable. Also, PL microscopy can be coupled to Raman microscopy 32 , and the chemical <lb/>selectivity of PL imaging can be increased by time resolution 33,34 . Such developments could dramatically increase <lb/>the number of applications of PL analysis using lab-based microscopes for the investigation of artistic materials. <lb/>Finally, the main limitation of works such as this one, conducted on micro-samples, is the limited repre-<lb/>sentativity of the results. In the case of Leonardo da Vinci, it is actually even more difficult to obtain samples, <lb/>as the exceptional status of the artworks naturally limits the availability of paint fragments. While the use of <lb/>micro-beams allows to access the complex paint layer build-ups at the micro-scale, by definition the volume of <lb/>probed mater is very limited. Current developments at C2RMF of non-invasive laboratory instruments, such as <lb/>a coupled macro-PL and macro-XRF scanner, permitting to collect PL spectra in each pixel of an entire painting <lb/>surface are thus promising in order to bridge the gap between micro and macro-scale. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This work explores the different grades of lead white that were used by Leonardo da Vinci to construct his final <lb/>masterpiece: The Virgin and Child with St. Anne. Based on the lead white composition and average crystallite <lb/>dimensions that were retrieved through Rietveld refinement of HR-XRD data, it is proposed that a post-synthesis <lb/>treatment was employed on Leonardo&apos;s raw pigments so as to obtain specific pictorial results. These chemical <lb/>results were found to be in agreement with historical manuscripts written by Leonardo himself, in which he left <lb/>clues with regards to the use of different grades of lead white. Moreover, complementary SR-µ-PL data obtained <lb/>on the full stratigraphy reveals how spectral unfolding of hyperspectral PL emission maps can be used to per-<lb/>form semi-quantitative lead white characterization in a spatially resolved manner, without exposing the precious <lb/>sample to high doses of ionizing radiation. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Synchrotron high-angle resolution X-ray diffraction (SR-HR-XRD). The two paint fragments α and <lb/>β were placed in a capillary and rotated in front of a 1 × 1 mm 2 beam at 35 keV. 20 min scans were repeated up <lb/>to a total acquisition time of 1-4 h to record XRD patterns with a satisfactory signal to noise ratio. The exploit-<lb/>able angular range was 2 ≤ 2θ (°) ≤ 22 (corresponding to 0.93 ≤ d (Å) ≤ 10.14) for the α fragment, allowing the <lb/>measurement of 152 reflections for C and 49 for HC. The main advantages of this configuration are the excellent <lb/>angular resolution (0.002°) and the absence of preferential orientation, allowing the collection of high-quality <lb/>datasets. The exploitable domain was narrower for the β fragment (4 ≤ 2θ (°) ≤ 14) due to a lower signal-to-noise <lb/>ratio. <lb/>Rietveld analyses of the XRD patterns were carried out with the FullProf Suite 35 , implementing the Thompson-<lb/>Cox-Hastings profile function with spherical harmonics expansion for the Lorentzian component and axial <lb/>broadening for the Gaussian in order to model the average microstructure. This allowed to derive a precise <lb/>composition (error bars of about ± 1 w% estimated from a C/HC calibration mixture) as well as modelling of <lb/>the morphology and dimensions of the pigment crystallites. <lb/>Synchrotron deep UV-excited photoluminescence (SR-µ-PL). The embedded St. Anne sample <lb/>was analyzed at the POLYPHEME end-station of the DISCO beamline (Synchrotron SOLEIL, Gif-sur-Yvette, <lb/>France). The POLYPHEME end-station performs hyperspectral photoluminescence micro-imaging, yielding <lb/>full emission spectra with high spectral resolution 36,37 . Spectra were recorded with a 40 × /0.6 NA Zeiss Ultrafluar <lb/>objective, a 250 nm excitation wavelength, an emission wavelength range of 400-680 nm (1.82-3.2 eV), and an <lb/>integration time of 8 s per spectrum. A map of 30 × 20 pixels was recorded with a step size of 3 µm, covering a <lb/>total sample area of 90 × 60 µm. <lb/>As a first step in the unfolding approach, the positions of the main constituent emission bands were deduced <lb/>from analysis of the average emission spectrum. In this process, the positions of local minima in the second <lb/>derivative are taken as positions for the constituent emission bands. For a model making use of n Gaussians, the <lb/>average spectrum is smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian of a width such that the second derivative of the <lb/>smoothed spectrum exhibits exactly n local minima. The width of the Gaussian used for smoothing is found <lb/>using an automated, iterative process in which each next guess is based on interpolation of all previous guesses. <lb/>A model consisting of n Gaussians is then fitted to the smoothed averaged spectrum to find the width σ of each <lb/>constituent emission band. The fitting algorithm is based on Newton&apos;s method in optimization, where the residual <lb/>sum of squares (RSS) is taken as the cost function. Soft parameter limits are implemented by adding a metric to <lb/>the cost function that rises exponentially beyond, but is close to zero within the limits. Having previously found <lb/>the positions of the main constituent emission bands and the baseline allows reducing the number of optimiz-<lb/>able variables to 2n (amplitude and σ). Reducing the number of data points in the spectrum from 512 to 8n <lb/>then allows rapid optimization, even for larger values of n, allowing the algorithm to converge several times in a <lb/>short period of time. Requesting twenty convergences on the same set of variables from different initial guesses <lb/>then reduces the chance of finding a local, rather than an absolute minimum. The optimization problem can be <lb/>formally denoted as: <lb/></body>

A graphical representation of the multi-step unfolding process is included <lb/>in the Supplementary Information. <lb/>Knowledge of the baseline, the positions and the widths of the main constituent emission bands now allows <lb/>rapid fitting of the 600 photoluminescence spectra that make up the hyperspectral map. Rather than twenty, <lb/>three convergences on the same set of parameters are requested per spectrum. The result of this fitting procedure <lb/>is a set of n amplitudes per spectrum, which can be displayed as emission amplitude matrices, resembling the <lb/>distribution of the compound emitting that particular emission band. It was found that there is high covariance <lb/>between the different emission amplitude matrices, implying that local absorption and/or reabsorption strongly <lb/>impacts the emission spectra. In a first approximation, these effects are corrected by normalizing each set of n <lb/>amplitudes A to their sum: <lb/></body>
