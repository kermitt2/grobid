The supercooled liquid fraction (SLF) in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) is an essential variable of cloud <lb/>microphysical processes and climate sensitivity. However, the SLF is currently calculated in spaceborne remote <lb/>sensing only as the cloud phase-frequency ratio of adjacent pixels, which results in a loss of the original resolu-<lb/>tion in observations of cloud liquid or ice content within MPCs. Here, we present a novel method for retrieving <lb/>the SLF in MPCs based on the differences in radiative properties of supercooled liquid droplets and ice particles <lb/>at visible (VIS) and shortwave infrared (SWI) channels of the geostationary Himawari-8. Liquid and ice water <lb/>paths are inferred by assuming that clouds are composed of only liquid or ice, with the real cloud water path <lb/>(CWP) expressed as a combination of these two water paths (SLF and 1-SLF as coefficients), and the SLF is <lb/>determined by referring to the CWP from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations <lb/>(CALIPSO). The statistically relatively small cloud phase spatial inhomogeneity at a Himawari-8 pixel level indi-<lb/>cates an optimal scene for cloud retrieval. The SLF results are comparable to global SLF distributions observed <lb/>by active instruments, particularly for single-layered cloud systems. While accessing the method&apos;s feasibility, <lb/>SLF averages are estimated between 74 % and 78 % in Southern Ocean (SO) stratocumulus across seasons, con-<lb/>trasting with a range of 29 % to 32 % in northeastern Asia. The former exhibits a minimum SLF around midday <lb/>in summer and a maximum in winter, while the latter trend differs. This novel algorithm will be valuable for <lb/>research to track the evolution of MPCs and constrain the related climate impact. <lb/></front>

    <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Clouds cover about 70 % of the Earth&apos;s surface and sig-<lb/>nificantly impact the hydrologic cycle and radiative budget <lb/>(Stephens et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2018). Liquid water <lb/>or ice forms in clouds and falls back to Earth as precipitation. <lb/>By reflecting incident solar radiation and trapping upwelling <lb/>radiation within the atmosphere, clouds result in an imbal-<lb/>ance of radiation budget. Mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), com-<lb/>posed of both supercooled liquid droplets and ice particles at <lb/>temperatures between 0 and -38 °C (Pruppacher and Klett, <lb/>2010), are recognized as the great sources of uncertainty in <lb/>precipitation formation and cloud radiative properties (Mc-<lb/>Coy et al., 2014; Mülmenstädt et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2016). <lb/>Cloud ice particles form and grow at the expense of super-<lb/>cooled liquid droplets in MPCs (Bergeron, 1935), and these <lb/>microphysical processes govern the lifecycle of MPCs and <lb/>precipitation formation (IPCC, 2021). Moreover, Lohmann <lb/>(2002) and Sassen and Khvorostyanov (2007) show that the <lb/>net radiative impact of MPCs decreases as supercooled liq-<lb/>uid droplets glaciate. Regarding the cloud-climate feedback, <lb/>if the supercooled liquid water is underestimated in MPCs, <lb/></body>

    <body>the overestimated ice water in a warmer climate will melt <lb/>to more cloud water with higher reflection, let more energy <lb/>back into space, and then offset global warming (Bjordal et <lb/>al., 2020) by about 2 °C at most (Tan et al., 2016). There-<lb/>fore, a comprehensive investigation of the supercooled liquid <lb/>fraction (SLF) in MPCs is imperative to reduce uncertain-<lb/>ties related to precipitation (Silber et al., 2021) and cloud-<lb/>climate feedback (Gettelman and Sherwood, 2016; Lohmann <lb/>and Neubauer, 2018). <lb/>Presently, numerous researchers have focused on assess-<lb/>ing the SLF and disentangling the associated precipitation <lb/>and climate impact (Mülmenstädt et al., 2015; Cesana and <lb/>Storelvmo, 2017; Henneberger et al., 2023). Laboratory ex-<lb/>periments, for instance, DeMott (1990), measure the fraction <lb/>of soot acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) for cloud ice <lb/>but cannot guarantee a good representation of the real atmo-<lb/>spheric conditions. Ramelli et al. (2021) correlate the liq-<lb/>uid, mixed-phase, and ice cloud regimes with an in situ mea-<lb/>sured SLF and calculate the ice particle multiplication with <lb/>respect to ice-nucleating particles -the opposite direction of <lb/>the SLF, but field experiments are naturally limited due to the <lb/>small sample volume and rarely repeated samplings in the <lb/>same cloud. Wang et al. (2023) use post-processed airborne <lb/>data to characterize the microphysical properties of super-<lb/>cooled liquid droplets and ice particles of stratiform mixed-<lb/>phase clouds and indicate that a high concentration of small <lb/>ice particles can be a result of the secondary ice production <lb/>in updraft regions. Besides, different global climate models <lb/>(GCMs) are generally unable to simulate the variation in the <lb/>SLF with temperature obtained from satellite data (Komurcu <lb/>et al., 2014; Desai et al., 2023). <lb/>To obtain a wider range of spatiotemporal scales, polar-<lb/>orbiting satellite observations are exploited to investigate <lb/>the SLF. The experiments using the CERES-CloudSat-<lb/>CALIPSO-MODIS satellite dataset (Kato et al., 2011) and <lb/>radiative transfer calculations show that cloud tops usually <lb/>have a larger SLF over the Southern Ocean (SO) (Bodas-<lb/>Salcedo et al., 2016), where the energy budget is poorly sim-<lb/>ulated in the absorbed shortwave radiation due to the role <lb/>of clouds (Trenberth and Fasullo, 2010; Huang et al., 2021). <lb/>Additionally, Choi et al. (2010), Tan et al. (2014), Zhang <lb/>et al. (2015), Li et al. (2017), Kawamoto et al. (2020), and <lb/>Villanueva et al. (2020, 2021) find that the variation in the <lb/>SLF is generally negatively correlated with the occurrence <lb/>of dust aerosols -effective INPs -using either the Cloud-<lb/>Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations <lb/>(CALIPSO) feature mask or the combined observations from <lb/>active remote sensing (CALIPSO and CloudSat) and pas-<lb/>sive remote sensing (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-<lb/>radiometer (MODIS) and Polarization and Directionality of <lb/>the Earth&apos;s Reflectances (POLDER)). This finding is obvious <lb/>in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) due to a large amount of <lb/>anthropogenic emissions. Once the aerosol effect on nucle-<lb/>ation is not predominant, Li et al. (2017) also demonstrated <lb/>the associated relationship between the SLF and meteorolog-<lb/>ical conditions in northeastern Asia. In these studies, how-<lb/>ever, only phase-frequency ratio, the ratio of liquid pixels to <lb/>the total liquid and ice cloudy pixels in adjacent pixels of <lb/>satellite images, is calculated. This treatment loses the orig-<lb/>inal resolution of observations of cloud liquid water or ice <lb/>content in MPCs and cannot easily investigate the change in <lb/>the SLF throughout the lifespan of clouds. <lb/>Geostationary passive satellite observations enable us not <lb/>only to capture the evolution of clouds at a larger scale (Letu <lb/>et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019), other than a narrow swath <lb/>observed from polar-orbiting satellites, but also to hold fa-<lb/>cility to retrieve the cloud liquid water or ice mass content <lb/>(Nakajima and Nakajima, 1995; Kawamoto et al., 2001; Plat-<lb/>nick et al., 2017; Heidinger et al., 2020; Stengel et al., 2020). <lb/>Coopman et al. (2019) simulated radiances of MPCs with a <lb/>radiative transfer model (RTM) and concluded that the sig-<lb/>nificant variation in cloud effective radius (CER) can serve <lb/>to depict the cloud phase transition from liquid to ice (the <lb/>change in the SLF) in a cloud-tracking algorithm. With these <lb/>insights, we design an experiment to investigate the potential <lb/>to retrieve the ratio of liquid content to total liquid and ice <lb/>content, the SLF, in MPCs using the observations of the new-<lb/>generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8, based on the <lb/>cloud microphysics retrieval. Cloud liquid water or ice con-<lb/>tent of a certain path -in other words, cloud water paths <lb/>(CWPs) -is calculated using cloud optical thickness (COT) <lb/>and CER retrieved based on the traditional cloud retrieval <lb/>scheme (Nakajima and King, 1990) with satellite radiances <lb/>at visible (VIS) and shortwave infrared (SWI) wavelength <lb/>channels. The ice particle shapes or liquid droplets used are <lb/>determined in advance, as their radiative properties may re-<lb/>sult in differences in the derived microphysical properties <lb/>(Baum et al., 2014; Holz et al., 2016; Letu et al., 2016; Yang <lb/>et al., 2018). Thus, differences in radiative properties of ice <lb/>particles and supercooled liquid droplets due to their refrac-<lb/>tive indices, sizes, concentration, and shapes can probably <lb/>be used to test the possibility of determining the cloud ice or <lb/>water mass (Sun and Shine, 1994) and subsequently the ice <lb/>fraction and SLF in MPCs. Nagao and Suzuki (2021, 2022) <lb/>developed a temperature-independent cloud phase retrieval <lb/>method that relies on differences between observed and sim-<lb/>ulated radiances under the assumptions of either liquid or ice <lb/>water when retrieving COT and CER. This approach consol-<lb/>idates our concept of the SLF retrieval. <lb/>In this paper we introduce an algorithm to retrieve the SLF, <lb/>and its first attempts at investigating of the diurnal cycle of <lb/>the SLF in distinct cloud regimes across seasons and hemi-<lb/>spheres, by exploiting different radiative properties of liquid <lb/>droplets and ice particles at VIS and SWI wavelengths. To <lb/>the authors&apos; knowledge, this is the first quantitative analy-<lb/>sis of the SLF at a single-pixel level of passive remote sens-<lb/>ing, especially for geostationary satellite observations with <lb/>the typically broadest spatiotemporal scales. MPCs, which <lb/>we focus on, are an important cloud phase with occurrences <lb/>around 27 % (Mayer et al., 2023) over the field of the geo-<lb/></body>

The paper is organized as follows: <lb/>the collocated datasets, the simulated radiative properties of <lb/>liquid droplets and ice particles, and the concrete SLF re-<lb/>trieval procedure are described in Sect. 2; the main results, <lb/>including the first retrieval of the SLF in MPCs for the se-<lb/>lected cases, the statistical cloud phase spatial inhomogene-<lb/>ity, the validation with the CALIPSO-GOCCP dataset, and <lb/>the feasibility of the method to investigate the diurnal cy-<lb/>cle of the SLF in different cloud systems, are discussed in <lb/>Sect. 3; and the conclusion is given in Sect. 4. <lb/>2 Data and methodology <lb/>2.1 Data collocation and preprocessing <lb/>The SLF retrieval method uses Himawari-8 spectral data <lb/>as the main input. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) <lb/>on board Himawari-8 has 3 VIS, 3 SWI, and 10 longwave <lb/>infrared (LWI) channels (listed in Table 1), with a spatial <lb/>resolution of 5 km (to be consistent with the official cloud <lb/>phase product used) and a time interval of 10 min for full <lb/>disk observations (60°S-60°N and 80°E-160°W; Bessho et <lb/>al., 2016). Each cloudy pixel is classified into (1) ice, (2) wa-<lb/>ter, and (3) MPCs, using reflectance ratios and brightness <lb/>temperature differences (Mouri et al., 2016). Our retrieval is <lb/>capable of providing the SLF in MPCs from this Himawari-8 <lb/>official product. Here, the MPCs consist of various condi-<lb/>tions: liquid on top of ice MPC (or vice versa) or liquid and <lb/>ice in the same cloud layer in 1 px. Cloud-top temperature <lb/>(CTT) is retrieved based on channel observations, vertical <lb/>profiles, and cloud type data and is used to define the tem-<lb/>perature isotherm for the SLF. The reflectance at VIS and <lb/>SWI is effective for retrieving cloud microphysical proper-<lb/>ties. The CALIPSO cloud water path CWP CALIPSO (Garnier <lb/>et al., 2021), estimated using CALIPSO Imaging Infrared <lb/>Radiometer (IIR) effective emissivity datasets and the micro-<lb/>physical index (Parol et al., 1991), provides the truth value of <lb/>cloud water and ice. <lb/>The CALIPSO orbit track passes over the Himawari-8 disk <lb/>between approximately 03:00 and 07:00 UTC each day. We <lb/>collocate the Himawari-8 spectral data with CALIPSO tracks <lb/>for January, May, August, and October 2017, covering re-<lb/>gions such as the North China Plain, the Tibetan Plateau, <lb/>the Indian and Pacific oceans, and the SO. The time dif-<lb/>ference is constrained to be the closest, and the resolution <lb/>of CWP CALIPSO is interpolated from 333 m to 5 km. AHI <lb/>pixels that do not have similar cloud-top heights (CTHs) <lb/>across all CALIPSO pixels are removed. In total, the num-<lb/>ber of collocated observations for model training and valida-<lb/>tion is 336 685 samples. To build the CWP prediction model <lb/>for the full disk of Himawari-8, the input consists of AHI <lb/>channel and geometrics data, including the solar zenith an-<lb/>gle (SZA), viewing zenith angle (VZA), and relative azimuth <lb/>angle (RAA), as well as the Aqua MODIS 16 d averaged <lb/>surface albedo with a resolution of 0.05°, which is adjusted <lb/>to match the AHI resolution using the closest-neighbor ap-<lb/>proach. The output of the model is represented by the vari-<lb/>able CWP CALIPSO . Table 1 provides specific information re-<lb/>garding the data. <lb/>To investigate the potential uncertainty of the SLF retrieval <lb/>from the cloud phase vertical and horizontal inhomogene-<lb/>ity, we use the &quot;ice&quot; and &quot;water&quot; flags found within the <lb/>&quot;Feature_Classification_Flags&quot; parameter of the CALIPSO <lb/>Level 2 Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product (spatial res-<lb/>olution: 333 m; Hu et al., 2009) during the same period in <lb/>2017. Here, the cloud phase is distinguished by the depolar-<lb/>ization ratio and layer-integrated backscatter intensity mea-<lb/>surements, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.5 in over <lb/>90 % of warm-water clouds (Hu et al., 2009).

    <body>layered cloud profiles divided by the number of total cloud <lb/>sample profiles at every 5°of latitude for the analysis of <lb/>zonal distribution. Here, we not only consider the topmost <lb/>cloudy pixel in the VFM product but also include a vertical <lb/>extension of 180 m (6 and 3 boxes at altitudes of 0-8.2 and <lb/>8.2-20.2 km) starting from cloud top. <lb/>We categorize cloudy boxes as belonging to distinct cloud <lb/>layers if there is a vertical cloud gap of at least 2 km be-<lb/>tween them. The horizontal scale of liquid and ice phase in <lb/>the single-layered cloud system is determined by multiply-<lb/>ing the number of continuous cloud-top phase profiles and <lb/>the 333 m along-track resolution of CALIPSO. <lb/>The lidar-only CALIPSO-GOCCP climatology (Chepfer <lb/>et al., 2010) developed to facilitate the evaluation of GCMs <lb/>is exploited for the validation of the SLF retrieval. This prod-<lb/>uct is derived from the original CALIPSO lidar measure-<lb/>ments and contains observational cloud diagnostics consis-<lb/>tent with the &quot;lidar simulator&quot; (resolution: 2°in latitude and <lb/>longitude; Chepfer et al., 2008). &quot;Ratio Ice/(Ice + Liq)&quot;, the <lb/>relative percentage of ice in cloud with respect to the to-<lb/>tal condensate in the &quot;3D_CloudFraction_phase&quot; dataset of <lb/>CALIPSO-GOCCP, is regarded as the &quot;true&quot; ice fraction <lb/>(IF). Himawari-8 retrievals for MPCs are averaged every 2°b <lb/>etween 60°S and 60°N to collocate the nearest CALIPSO-<lb/>GOCCP grids and ensure the closest match between two <lb/>groups of CTHs. <lb/>2.2 Radiative properties of liquid droplets and ice <lb/>particles <lb/>The foundational theory behind SLF retrieval lies in the dif-<lb/>ferences in radiative properties between liquid droplets and <lb/>ice particles. Before delving into their optical properties, <lb/>we have an analysis of cloud phase as a function of CTT <lb/>observed by Himawari-8, considering the direct correlation <lb/>between temperature and cloud glaciation. As depicted in <lb/>Sect. S1 in the Supplement, the distribution of ice phase, <lb/>MPCs (including supercooled), and liquid clouds aligns with <lb/>expected temperature ranges -water phase dominates at <lb/>CTTs larger than 273 K, ice phase occurs at CTTs smaller <lb/>than 233 K, and MPCs are between these thresholds. <lb/>Subsequently, we start to choose appropriate ice particle <lb/>habits, considering their distinct scattering capabilities. On <lb/>a global scale, the relatively high occurrence rate of super-<lb/>cooled water is consistent with that of droxtals, which appear <lb/>at a latitude band of about 30°at high levels in both the NH <lb/>and Southern Hemisphere (SH) (Sato and Okamoto, 2023). <lb/>Yang et al. (2003) also demonstrate that droxtals may pro-<lb/>vide a realistic representation of the smallest nonspherical ice <lb/>crystals. In the ice cloud habit model employed in MODIS <lb/>Collection 5, droxtals are also assigned a 100 % habit frac-<lb/>tion for particle diameters below 60 µm (Baum et al., 2005). <lb/>Thus, we incorporated droxtals, spherical crystals, and Mie-<lb/>scattering databases for ice particles and liquid droplets into <lb/>the RSTAR7 RTM (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986) and ana-<lb/>lyzed the sensitivity of radiative properties to thermodynamic <lb/>phase states and particle shape. The radiative transfer simula-<lb/>tions were performed using the US standard atmospheric pro-<lb/>file. With this RTM, the Himawari-8 radiance in the 2.3 µm <lb/>channel (SWI 2.3), which is used to retrieve the official cloud <lb/>microphysical product of Himawari-8 because of its sensitiv-<lb/>ity to both COT and CER for thin clouds, is simulated. <lb/>In Fig. 1 we present the sensitivity of the SWI 2.3 radi-<lb/>ance to liquid droplets or ice particle shapes with respect to <lb/>SZA, VZA, COT, and CER. In Fig. 1a, radiance decreases <lb/>with increasing SZA, while in Fig. 1b an increasing trend <lb/>with VZA is shown. Figure 1c reveals satellite-observed ra-<lb/>diance generally rising as COT increases, stabilizing beyond <lb/>COT = 15. Conversely, in Fig. 1d, it decreases with rising <lb/>CER, with the rate of decrease gradually slowing. The re-<lb/>sults confirm that changes in COT and CER have a great <lb/>impact on radiance. With respect to the influence from se-<lb/>lected droplets or ice particles, the radiance is generally high-<lb/>est for droxtals and lowest for liquid droplets. The disparity <lb/>due to thermodynamic phase between spherical ice particles <lb/>and liquid droplets is not significant, whereas the simulated <lb/>radiance from droxtals is much larger than that of spherical <lb/>ice particles, which confirms the importance of ice particle <lb/>shape assumptions in the RTM. <lb/>2.3 Retrieval procedure <lb/>COT and CER provide the basics for the calculation of CWP. <lb/>The differences between the liquid water path LWP SCs and <lb/>ice water path IWP of assumed SCs and ice clouds, com-<lb/>posed of liquid droplets or droxtals only, and the reference <lb/>CWP CALIPSO can be used to evaluate the SLF in MPCs. <lb/>The SLF retrieval for MPCs consists of three main steps, <lb/>and the corresponding procedure is shown in Fig. 2. <lb/>1. We retrieve CWP under two extreme assumptions: <lb/>(a) the cloud is fully liquid (supercooled), and ice does <lb/>not contribute to the spectral observations; and (b) the <lb/>cloud is fully glaciated, and liquid droplets do not affect <lb/>the satellite radiances. This provides us with LWP SCs <lb/>and IWP. It is conducted by means of the conventional <lb/>cloud retrieval scheme by Nakajima and King (1990) <lb/>that COT and CER can be determined by the radiances <lb/>at VIS and SWI. The scheme is applied with RSTAR7 <lb/>RTM calculations. To speed up the technique, the ran-<lb/>dom forest (RF) technique (Ri et al., 2022), widely used <lb/>in regression problems by randomly combining multi-<lb/>ple decision trees and demonstrating good performance <lb/>even in the presence of many unknown features and <lb/>noise within the dataset, is used to emulate the RTM <lb/>calculations for VIS 0.64 and SWI 2.3 available from <lb/>Himawari-8. The COT and CER are derived when the <lb/>RTM emulator radiance pairs are closest to the actual <lb/>satellite observations (for details, see Sect. S2, Fig. S2, <lb/>and Table S1 in the Supplement). Then, LWP SCs and <lb/></body>

In addition to LWP SCs and IWP we derive the total <lb/>CWP prediction for the MPC pixels. To this end, we de-<lb/>velop another RF model that is trained mainly with <lb/>channel data (see Table 1) from Himawari-8 observa-<lb/>tions and &quot;Ice_Liquid_Water_Path&quot; from the CALIPSO <lb/>IIR dataset CWP CALIPSO as input and output, re-<lb/>spectively, based on the CALIPSO-Himawari-8 collo-<lb/>cated measurements. Similarly to the model training <lb/>for the RTM, we set &quot;n_estimators&quot;, &quot;criterion&quot;, and <lb/>&quot;min_samples_leaf&quot; in RF as 100, mean squared er-<lb/>ror, and 1. The collocated dataset was split into train-<lb/>ing (90 %) and test (10 %) data randomly. The CWP <lb/>prediction model demonstrates high accuracy, achiev-<lb/>ing an R-squared (R 2 ) value of 0.97 and mean absolute <lb/>error (MAE) of 8.32 g m -2 between the model simula-<lb/>tions and the individual test data. With this procedure, <lb/>the reference CWP prediction can be predicted for the full <lb/>Himawari-8 disk. <lb/>3. For every MPC pixel in the official Himawari-8 product, <lb/>we assume that CWP prediction is the weighted mean of <lb/>LWP SCs and IWP, two extreme situations where no ice <lb/>or no liquid water is contained in the cloud: <lb/>LWP SCs × SLF + IWP × IF = CWP prediction , <lb/>(2) <lb/>SLF + IF = 1. <lb/>(3) <lb/></body>

    <body>Figure 2. Roadmap of the SLF retrieval process and subsequent validation. The retrieval process is delineated into three distinct steps, each <lb/>indicated by color-coded rectangles: blue, green, and yellow. <lb/>The two coefficients SLF and IF in the combination in <lb/>Eq. (2) represent the relative contribution of liquid and ice <lb/>to the total CWP and satisfy the condition that SLF = 0 <lb/>when IF = 1 (only ice) and vice versa for purely supercooled <lb/>clouds. Thus, we set the sum of SLF and IF to 1 in Eq. (3), <lb/>and Eq. (2) can be solved for the SLF. This way, the SLF is <lb/>retrieved for the first time from a cloud water and ice mass <lb/>equation for every single pixel. <lb/>In the detected MPCs, liquid droplets and ice particles <lb/>may be uniformly distributed or spatially separated, and the <lb/>horizontal-length scale varies from 100 km down to 100 m <lb/>according to airborne measurements (Korolev and Milbrandt, <lb/>2022). The ideal scenario for a cloud retrieval is that liquid <lb/>droplets or ice particles group into large, separate pockets <lb/>and reduce the inhomogeneity. For that reason, the cloud <lb/>phase spatial inhomogeneity is estimated (Sect. 3.2). In the <lb/>cloud retrieval scheme, the bi-spectral reflectance method <lb/>with VIS and SWI (e.g., at 1.6, 2.3, or 3.7 µm) is exploited. <lb/>The shorter wavelength shows a larger sensitivity to the CER <lb/>at a deeper location within the cloud, with the SWI 2.3 in <lb/>this study being susceptible to CER below the cloud tops. <lb/>In addition to the cloud phase horizontal extension, the pres-<lb/>ence of a cloud phase overlap scene poses the difficulty for <lb/>algorithm application. Moreover, the variety in ice particle <lb/>habits arising from multiple particle growth regimes (Huang <lb/>et al., 2021) renders the assumption of using a singular ice <lb/>particle shape -droxtals -simplistic. Thus, larger uncer-<lb/>tainty and possibly invalid SLF retrieval are expected for <lb/>ice-dominated MPCs, such as some warm conveyor belts <lb/>(WCBs) or deep tropical convections. In all invalid cases, the <lb/>retrieved SLF manifests as negative values, resulting from IF <lb/>exceeding 100 %. Phase overlap contributes to 63 % of the to-<lb/>tal number of these cases. Focusing on ice-dominated MPCs, <lb/>including WCBs and convection, we utilize Fig. 3 in the sub-<lb/>sequent section as a visual demonstration. The corresponding <lb/>retrieved SLF, approximately 0 % in Fig. 3d, aids in inter-<lb/>preting the uncertainties of retrieval in ice-dominated MPCs <lb/>within the northeastern Asia region depicted in Fig. 3b. Neg-<lb/>ative values of the SLF are set to zero for these invalid re-<lb/>trievals in phase-overlap scenes and ice-dominant MPCs, and <lb/>they are consequently excluded from the statistical analysis. <lb/>The uncertainties in the developed method may arise due to <lb/>the limited dataset. To verify if the combination coefficients <lb/>correspond to the real SLF and IF, and to verify the feasi-<lb/>bility of the method, the retrieved SLF is validated with the <lb/>CALIPSO-GOCCP product on a global scale (Sect. 3.3) and <lb/>in the vertical direction from lidar measurements for different <lb/>cloud regimes (Sect. 3.4). <lb/>3 Results and discussion <lb/>3.1 Retrieval of the SLF in mixed-phase clouds <lb/>As a first application, we perform our retrieval on satellite <lb/>observations on 28 August 2017 at 04:00 UTC, and the out-<lb/>puts are presented in Fig. 3 for the scene of MPCs from the <lb/>official Himawari-8 product. In Fig. 3a, the RGB image, and <lb/>in Fig. 3b, the cloud phase classification, we show that MPCs <lb/>are more prevalent over the middle latitudes, with a particular <lb/>concentration observed over the SO and northeastern Asia. In <lb/>agreement with the RTM simulations in Fig. 1, the COT and <lb/>CER retrieved for the assumed fully supercooled clouds in <lb/>Fig. S3a and c in the Supplement are slightly larger and obvi-<lb/>ously smaller, respectively, than those of the pure ice clouds <lb/>in Fig. S3b and d (for details, please refer to Fig. S3).

The values of the re-<lb/>trieved SLF in Fig. 3d generally tend to have a negative corre-<lb/>lation with the CWP prediction . In this case, the SLF increases <lb/>from the subtropics to the upper middle latitudes, and an SLF <lb/>larger than 80 % is frequently observed over the SO, related <lb/>to either the deactivation of INPs from the increasing sulfate <lb/>aerosol coagulation (Hu et al., 2010) or the low availability <lb/>of INPs due to the remoteness of anthropogenic emissions <lb/>(Matus and L&apos;Ecuyer, 2017).

To depict three-dimensional structures of clouds, <lb/>we collect the CALIPSO VFM datasets and plot the zonal <lb/>distributions of the seasonal averaged single-layered cloud <lb/>fractions, together with cloud liquid and ice phase along-<lb/>track horizontal scales (see Fig. 4). From our statistical re-<lb/>sults we show that the seasonal variations in single-layered <lb/>cloud percentages are small. The high-value and low-value <lb/>centers of the fractions (magenta lines) stand out. One major <lb/>minimum lower than 45 % occurs in the tropics in Fig. 4d, <lb/>and two minor minima occur in the middle to high latitudes; <lb/>two local peaks up to 87 % occur in the subtropics to mid-<lb/>dle latitudes in Fig. 4a from major stratocumulus-dominated <lb/>oceanic areas. <lb/>The along-track horizontal scales of cloud liquid or ice <lb/>in single-layered cloud systems have obvious zonal and sea-<lb/>sonal variations. The liquid phase (black line) has minimum <lb/>scales (approximately 10-15 km) in the tropics and poleward <lb/>of 40°N/S and maximum scales (up to 382 km) at 20°S in <lb/>Fig. 4d. The ice phase generally has the opposite distribution <lb/>of horizontal scales, with a common maximum larger than <lb/>320 km at subtropics, which can be caused by dissipating <lb/>convection and the subsequent horizontal cirrus anvils. The <lb/>local maximum during spring (Fig. 4b; red line) in the north-<lb/>ern midlatitudes may be due to the influences of high-level <lb/>dust on ice nucleation (Choi et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2014; <lb/>Villanueva et al., 2020). In general, cloud phase tends to <lb/>cluster as large pockets (Korolev and Milbrandt, 2022), and <lb/>liquid and ice pixels along the CALIPSO orbit track are <lb/>not homogeneously mixed (Coopman and Tan., 2023) at the <lb/>Himawari-8 pixel level (5 km). <lb/>3.3 Comparison with CALIPSO-GOCCP <lb/>To further estimate the accuracy of our SLF retrieval, we <lb/>perform an evaluation using CALIPSO-GOCCP, which is <lb/>independent of IIR CWP CALIPSO for training the model in <lb/>Sect. 2.3. In Fig. 5 we present the comparison between <lb/>Himawari-8 retrieval results and CALIPSO-GOCCP, focus-<lb/>ing on hemispherical and seasonal differences in the mean <lb/>SLF. The magenta lines represent the number of collocated <lb/>MPC pixels as a function of latitude (longitude: 80°E-<lb/>160°W). Similarly to the SLF pattern in the case study dis-<lb/>cussed in Sect. 3.1, low SLF values are detected from ap-<lb/>proximately 20 to 40°latitude, particularly over the NH. This <lb/>is depicted in Fig. 5c, where the monthly average value hits <lb/>a minimum of 54 %. This phenomenon can be attributed to <lb/>the inverse relationship between the SLF and aerosol load-<lb/>ings (Choi et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2014; Li et <lb/>al., 2017; Villanueva et al., 2020, 2021). The zonal mean SLF <lb/>values exhibit notably higher levels at higher latitudes, par-<lb/>ticularly evident in May in the NH and during both May and <lb/>August in the SH. The reason is that the correlation between <lb/>the SLF and surface temperature is almost negative with de-<lb/>creasing temperature (Li et al., 2017). The MPCs over the <lb/>SO during austral winter (Fig. 5c) show the larger propor-<lb/>tion of supercooled liquid, reaching approximately 90 %.

The smaller <lb/>SLF is possibly due to strong precipitation exhausting the <lb/>large supercooled liquid droplets. The numbers are consis-<lb/>tent with the statistical results of the zonal mean cloud SLF <lb/>for medium clouds (3.36-6.72 km) from Fig. 2c in Guo et <lb/>al.

The average MAE, root-mean-square error (RMSE), <lb/>and correlation coefficient (CC) are 9.18 %, 10.76 %, and <lb/>0.69, respectively. Figure 5 illustrates that the accuracy of <lb/>the SLF retrieval decreases during austral autumn and win-<lb/>ter, notably in January and October in the NH, primarily at-<lb/>tributed to the misclassification of snow-covered surfaces as <lb/>ice clouds on the complex terrain, from the high surface vis-<lb/>ible reflection detected by Himawari-8. In May and August, <lb/>the MAE can decrease to as low as 7.38 %, and the CC can <lb/>reach as high as 0.80. In contrast, in January and October, the <lb/>highest RMSE is 13.25 %, the MAE can increase to 10.24 %, <lb/>and the CC can decline to 0.60. Overall, the SLF retrieval <lb/>is comparable to the CALIPSO-GOCCP lidar observations. <lb/>The results in Fig. 5 indicate that retrieval accuracy is at its <lb/>peak around 20°S, where single-layered cloud systems pre-<lb/>vail, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.

The color of the <lb/>squares represents the SLF values. <lb/>picted in Fig. 6b, the SLF consistently remains below 50 %. <lb/>Notably, the retrieved SLF shows better agreement with the <lb/>CALIOP-GOCCP over the oceanic areas, and the deviation <lb/>is always within the range of ±10 %. The underestimation <lb/>of the retrieved SLF can be found in the WCB, particularly <lb/>around 38°N, with a bias up to 20 %. The values of MAE, <lb/>RMSE, and CC for these two cases are 10.53 % and 13.17 %, <lb/>12.31 % and 14.44 %, and 0.94 and 0.69, respectively. Please <lb/>refer to Fig. S4 in the Supplement for details. This finding is <lb/>consistent with the discussion on the algorithm uncertainty <lb/>from cloud phase overlap and the assumption of ice particle <lb/>shapes in Sect. 2.3. <lb/>The question arises, what factors influence the variations <lb/>in observed values of the SLF over the SO and the WCB in <lb/>northeastern Asia? Possible factors might include thermody-<lb/>namics, air advection, and background aerosols. To test the <lb/>feasibility of the method in examining the driven factors un-<lb/>der different conditions, we illustrate the seasonal variation <lb/>in the diurnal cycle of the retrieved SLF in MPCs includ-<lb/>ing the SO&apos;s stratocumuli and northeastern Asian cloud sys-<lb/>tems represented by red and blue rectangles in Fig. 3, which <lb/>encompass the section of the CALIPSO track at 04:00 UTC <lb/>(two magenta lines) shown in Fig. 6. <lb/>Initially, we calculate the CTT to identify the temperature <lb/>bin where the SLF is located. The average CTT in the diurnal <lb/>cycle for SO stratocumuli (northeastern Asian cloud regimes) <lb/>in January, May, August, and October is -9 °C (-19 °C), <lb/>-24 °C (-14 °C), -18 °C (-14 °C), and -13 °C (-15 °C), <lb/>respectively. In the SO, mean CTTs reach a minimum at <lb/>noon, whereas over northeastern Asia, the warmest CTTs are <lb/>observed at 06:00 UTC, which is consistent with the findings <lb/>in Fig. 11 of Taylor et al. (2017). In Fig. 7a, the SO&apos;s stra-<lb/>tocumuli during austral summer display minimal SLF val-<lb/>ues in the early morning and late afternoon, with an average <lb/>of around 74 % and a peak of 81 % by 06:00 UTC, which <lb/>can be explained by the transformation to supercooled liq-<lb/>uid droplets as temperature decreases in the relatively warm <lb/>environment. This observation aligns with the results from <lb/>Noel et al. (2018) based on measurements obtained from <lb/>the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar aboard <lb/>the non-sun-synchronous International Space Station (ISS) <lb/>to some extent. Noel et al. (2018) indicate that during sum-<lb/>mer, low-level liquid cloud droplets at a similar height ex-<lb/>hibit a peak occurrence in the early afternoon, approximately <lb/>around 14:00 LT. Contrarily, Fig. 7c shows a larger SLF at <lb/>75 % around 02:00 UTC, dropping to a low of 70 % until <lb/>05:00 UTC, then gradually rising to 86 % by 10:00 UTC in <lb/>winter. Wang et al. (2022) also use the CATS lidar dataset <lb/>to analyze the near-global SLF diurnal cycle between 51°S <lb/>and 51°N at isothermal layers between -10 and -30 °C, and <lb/>the minimum and maximum values are consistent with the <lb/>retrieved SLF here. The vertical motion over the SO is rela-<lb/>tively weak, and the atmosphere there remains stable. Naud <lb/>et al. (2006) indicated a relationship between the changes <lb/>in glaciation temperature of supercooled liquid and the sur-<lb/>face temperature pattern, and Li et al. (2017) note a positive <lb/>correlation between the SLF and surface temperature at the <lb/>-10 °C isotherm at middle and high latitudes.

In contrast, dur-<lb/>ing austral winter over northeastern Asia in the NH, the SLF <lb/>peaks at 33 % around 05:00 UTC in Fig. 7a. The differences <lb/>in the diurnal cycle of the SLF are complex and can be at-<lb/>tributed not only to thermodynamics but also to dynamics, <lb/>including vertical up-and downdrafts and advection trans-<lb/>port of dust aerosols over northeastern Asia (Li et al., 2017). <lb/>Wang et al. (2022) further indicate that the correlation be-<lb/>tween the SLF and meteorological parameters is unstable. <lb/>Compared with austral spring, the aerosol effect on nucle-<lb/>ation in the SO (Fig. 7b) becomes apparent in austral autumn <lb/>due to an increase in the frequency of INPs, such as aerosols <lb/>from sea spray due to reduced sea ice (Dietel et al., 2023). <lb/>The SLF value in the SO&apos;s stratocumuli generally decreases, <lb/>ranging between 64 % and 79 %. In contrast, the SLF in aus-<lb/>tral spring (Fig. 7d) is generally larger, averaging between <lb/>69 % and 82 %. Over northeastern Asia, the SLF shows re-<lb/>duced values in austral spring (27 %-32 %; Fig. 7b) com-<lb/>pared to autumn (29 %-37 %; Fig. 7d), likely due to an in-<lb/>crease in aerosol frequencies from dust regions during spring <lb/>(Shang et al., 2018). The trend in the diurnal cycle of the SLF <lb/>in spring and autumn is similar to that in winter and summer, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>The average SLF within these two respective cloud sys-<lb/>tems consistently presents distinct characteristics: a notably <lb/>higher SLF in stratocumulus and a lower SLF over north-<lb/>eastern Asia. The SLF in SO stratocumuli in austral spring, <lb/>summer, autumn, and winter is 76 %, 74 %, 70 %, and 78 %, <lb/>respectively. Over northeastern Asia, the corresponding SLF <lb/>values are 29 %, 32 %, 32 %, and 30 %. The SLF over the <lb/>SO aligns closely with the values depicted in Fig. 5. How-<lb/>ever, in the NH, the SLF appears notably smaller in Fig. 7 <lb/>compared to the statistical results in Fig. 5, possibly because <lb/>the selected cloud regimes primarily cover land areas in the <lb/>NH in Fig. 7, while the statistics in Fig. 5 encompass oceanic <lb/>regions. Huang et al. (2015) suggest that the difference in <lb/>the occurrence of supercooled liquid clouds is fundamen-<lb/>tally controlled by thermodynamics. Latitudinal and seasonal <lb/>variations in atmospheric profiles are influenced by dynamic <lb/>mechanisms (Li et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2022), and the sig-<lb/>nificant influence of aerosols is highlighted in multiple stud-<lb/>ies (Choi et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2014; Li et <lb/>al., 2017; Villanueva et al., 2020, 2021). <lb/>This investigation into the hemispheric and seasonal con-<lb/>trast of the diurnal cycle of the SLF in stratocumuli and cloud <lb/>systems over northeastern Asia is the assessment of the fea-<lb/>sibility of the developed method, and it would not be fea-<lb/>sible without the initial retrieval of the SLF using the algo-<lb/>rithm first developed in this research for geostationary satel-<lb/>lite observations covering a broader range of spatiotemporal <lb/>scales than other measurements.

    <body>to cover the years 2017 to 2019, allowing a comprehensive <lb/>examination of the observed trend in the SLF. <lb/>4 Conclusions <lb/>In this study we present the development of a novel algo-<lb/>rithm to characterize the liquid content ratio to the total liquid <lb/>and ice content, the SLF, instead of the phase-frequency ratio <lb/>in MPCs, using Himawari-8 geostationary satellite observa-<lb/>tions. The algorithm tests utilize the different radiative prop-<lb/>erties of supercooled liquid droplets and droxtal ice particles <lb/>and applies them in the process of retrieving supercooled liq-<lb/>uid and ice cloud microphysical properties with satellite ra-<lb/>diances at VIS and SWI. The CALIPSO-Himawari-8 mea-<lb/>surements provide the reliable reference CWP for inferring <lb/>the SLF and IF. With actual retrievals in our case study, the <lb/>proposed method has been verified, and the SLF can be well-<lb/>constrained. The retrieval results clearly map the distribution <lb/>of liquid or ice water content in MPCs over representative <lb/>areas, for instance, the Southern Ocean. In a broad range <lb/>of spatiotemporal scales, the cloud phase has a small spa-<lb/>tial variability, as observed from satellites, which presents <lb/>an optimal scenario for the application of our algorithm. <lb/>From the zonal comparison results covering different sea-<lb/>sons in 2017, our retrieved SLF agrees well with CALIPSO-<lb/>GOCCP, with an MAE, RMSE, and correlation coefficient of <lb/>9.18 %, 10.76 %, and 0.69, respectively. The new algorithm <lb/>shows higher accuracy, especially in single-layered cloud <lb/>systems with a relatively large deviation of 20 % in lower-<lb/>SLF regimes. <lb/>To verify the effectiveness of the SLF retrieval algorithm, <lb/>this study analyzes the seasonal and hemispheric contrast of <lb/>the diurnal cycle of the SLF in MPCs from distinct cloud <lb/>regimes. The average SLF of stratocumulus over part of the <lb/>Southern Ocean ranges between 74 % and 78 % across var-<lb/>ious seasons, while that in the cloud systems over north-<lb/>eastern Asia falls within the range of 29 % and 32 %. In <lb/>the Southern Ocean, the SLF reaches its minimum around <lb/>noon in summer and its maximum in winter. The trend in the <lb/>Northern Hemisphere is different. Previous studies mainly <lb/>focused on binary cloud thermodynamic phase (Sun and <lb/>Shine, 1994; Hu et al., 2009; Mouri et al., 2016; Schmit et <lb/>al., 2017; Mayer et al., 2023) or SLF measurements and sim-<lb/>ulations (Shupe et al., 2008; McCoy et al., 2015), or they <lb/>have demonstrated the relationship between SLF changes <lb/>and meteorological parameters (Li et al., 2017) and investi-<lb/>gated the leading importance with respect to cloud-climate <lb/>impact (Tan et al., 2016; Lohmann and Neubauer, 2018). <lb/>However, investigations into the diurnal cycle of the SLF <lb/>have received far less attention. While some studies, such as <lb/>the one by Wang et al. (2022), have attempted global-scale <lb/>assessments of the SLF using lidar measurements, tracking <lb/>the life cycle of MPCs remains challenging. This difficulty <lb/>stems from the absence of a retrieval method developed for <lb/>geostationary satellite observations with the rapid revisit rate <lb/>required for comprehensive monitoring. <lb/>Our results ideally fill this research gap and confirm the <lb/>feasibility of utilizing passive geostationary satellite remote <lb/>sensing to retrieve the SLF. The previous phase-frequency <lb/>ratio method leads to an upscaling of satellite observations, <lb/>but our retrieval product can preserve the original resolu-<lb/>tion. In addition to validating the retrieved SLF along the <lb/>lidar track, we propose a more comprehensive analysis of <lb/>the disparities in the global distribution (Himawari-8 disk) of <lb/>multi-annual maps (Stengel et al., 2020) between Himawari-<lb/>8 observations and CALIPSO-GOCCP data. Moreover, aug-<lb/>menting the analysis with statistical insights derived from <lb/>longer-term datasets, spanning multiple years, would further <lb/>consolidate the scientific conclusions regarding the observed <lb/>trends in the SLF. Our approach not only provides the op-<lb/>portunity to track the evolution of MPCs thanks to the high <lb/>spatiotemporal resolution of geostationary observations, but <lb/>it also enhances the ability to constrain the ice production <lb/>processes during MPC glaciation in GCMs. This will be the <lb/>topic for a forthcoming study designed to estimate cloud-<lb/>climate feedback. Moreover, our method can be improved <lb/>with the incorporation of a temperature-dependent ice parti-<lb/>cle habit diagram. Furthermore, our method could be adapted <lb/>for use with the polar-orbiting Earth Cloud Aerosol and Ra-<lb/>diation Explorer (EarthCARE; Wehr et al., 2023) satellite to <lb/>be launched in 2024, which features both a multispectral im-<lb/>ager and an atmospheric lidar instrument on board. This ex-<lb/>tension opens up new possibilities for global studies in the <lb/>field of cloud phase-climate feedback. <lb/></body>
