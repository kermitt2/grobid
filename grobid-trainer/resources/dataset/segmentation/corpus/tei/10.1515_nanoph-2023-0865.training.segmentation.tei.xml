The problem consists in finding the right assumptions on a function K so that it is the Q-Curvature <lb/>of a metric conformal to the standard one on the sphere. Using some pinching condition, we track the change in <lb/>topology that occurs when crossing a critical level (or a virtually critical level if it is a critical point at infinity) <lb/>and then compute a certain Euler-Poincaré index which allows us to prove the existence of many solutions. The <lb/>locations of the levels sets of these solutions are determined in a very precise manner. These type of multiplicity <lb/>results are new and are proved without any assumption of symmetry or periodicity on the function K. <lb/>Keywords: partial differential equations; analysis on manifolds; Q curvature problem <lb/>AMS subject classification: 35A15; 58J05; 58E05 <lb/></front>

        <body>1 Introduction and main results <lb/>In [1], Branson introduced a conformally operator defined on n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with n ≥ 5 <lb/>which generalizes the Paneitz operator defined on 4-manifolds [2]. The conformal Branson operator is defined <lb/>on a smooth compact Riemannian n-manifold (M, g 0 ), n ≥ 5, by the following formula: <lb/>P n <lb/>g 0 <lb/>u = Δ 2 <lb/>g 0 <lb/>u -div g 0 (𝛼 n R g 0 g 0 + 𝛽 n Ric g 0 )du + <lb/>n -4 <lb/>2 <lb/>Q u, <lb/>where <lb/>𝛼 n = <lb/>(n -2) 2 + 4 <lb/>2(n -1)(n -2) <lb/>, <lb/>𝛽 n = <lb/>-4 <lb/>n -2 <lb/>Q := Q n <lb/>g 0 = -<lb/>1 <lb/>2(n -1) <lb/>Δ g 0 R g 0 + <lb/>n 3 -4n 2 + 16n -16 <lb/>8(n -1) 2 (n -2) 2 R 2 <lb/>g 0 -<lb/>2 <lb/>(n -2) 2 |Ric g 0 | 2 <lb/>with R g 0 denotes the scalar curvature of (M, g 0 ) and Ric g 0 denotes the Ricci curvature of (M, g 0 ). <lb/>Notice that, if g = u 4∕(n-4) g 0 is a metric conformal to g 0 , where u is a smooth positive function, then for <lb/>all 𝜓 ∈ C ∞ (M), the conformal Branson operator satisfies the following covariance property: <lb/>P n <lb/>g 0 <lb/>(u𝜓) = u (n+4)∕(n-4) P n <lb/>g (𝜓). <lb/></body>

        <body>Taking 𝜓 ≡ 1, we then obtain <lb/>P n <lb/>g 0 <lb/>(u) = <lb/>n -4 <lb/>2 <lb/>Q n <lb/>g u (n+4)∕(n-4) . <lb/>(1) <lb/>In view of equation (1), a natural question is whether it is possible to prescribe the Q curvature, that is: given <lb/>a function h: M → ℝ, does there exist a metric g, in the conformal class of g 0 , whose Q-curvature is equal to h, <lb/>that is equivalent to solving the following problem <lb/>P n <lb/>g 0 <lb/>(u) = <lb/>n -4 <lb/>2 <lb/>h u (n+4)∕(n-4) , <lb/>u &gt; 0 <lb/>inM. <lb/>(2) <lb/>The Q-Curvature problem has attracted a lot of attention in the last half century. For more background <lb/>information on Q-Curvature problem, we refer to the lecture notes [3], [4] and the survey articles of Chang [5] <lb/>and Chang-Yang [6]. More recently, there are more and more interests in Q-Curvature problem. See [6]-[27] and <lb/>references therein. <lb/>In this paper, we deal with the case of standard sphere 𝕊 n endowed with its standard metric. Thus, we are <lb/>looking for a solution u of the following nonlinear problem involving the critical Sobolev exponent: <lb/>( K ) <lb/>u := Δ 2 u -c n Δu + d n u = Ku <lb/>n+4 <lb/>n-4 , <lb/>u &gt; 0 <lb/>on𝕊 n , <lb/>where c n = 1 <lb/>2 (n 2 -2n -4), d n = n-4 <lb/>16 n(n 2 -4) and where K is a given function defined on 𝕊 n . <lb/>The requirement about the positivity of the function u is necessary for the metric g to be Riemannian. <lb/>Problem ( K ) has a variational structure in the sense that its solutions correspond to the positive critical <lb/>points of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional J K defined by: <lb/>J K (u) = <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝕊 n <lb/>K|u| 2n∕(n-4) <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>(4-n)∕n <lb/>(3) <lb/>defined on the unit sphere Σ of H 2 (𝕊 n ) endowed with the following norm: <lb/>‖u‖ 2 = ⟨u, u⟩  = ∫ <lb/>𝕊 n <lb/>u ⋅ u = ∫ <lb/>𝕊 n <lb/>| Δu | 2 +c n ∫ <lb/>𝕊 n <lb/>| ∇u | 2 +d n ∫ <lb/>𝕊 n <lb/>u 2 . <lb/>Studying problem ( K ) by using variational methods is quite difficult since the functional J K does not satisfy <lb/>the Palais-Smale condition. This means that there exist a sequence (u k ) k along which J K (u k ) is bounded, ∇J K (u k ) <lb/>goes to zero and (u k ) k does not converge. In addition, due to topological obstructions of Kazdan-Warner type <lb/>(see [13] and [28]), problem ( K ) does not have solutions for every function K. <lb/>In dimensions n = 5, 6, we studied problem ( K ) by using the tools of the critical point at infinity theory <lb/>and an Euler-Poincaré counting formula, see [8], [9]. For the case of higher dimensions, problem ( K ) becomes <lb/>difficult due to the complexity of the lack of compactness. Indeed every k -tuple of critical points of K with <lb/>negative Laplacian gives rise a critical point at infinity and under the assumption that there are no solutions the <lb/>above mentioned index counting formulae are always equal to one. Furthermore every solution gives rise to a <lb/>mixed critical point at infinity corresponding to this solution plus a sum of Dirac functions, See [16]. Recently, <lb/>inspired by the results obtained by Malchiodi and Mayer [29] for the conformal Laplacian equation, we have <lb/>proved some existence results under pinching conditions [10]. <lb/>In this paper, we consider the case of higher dimensional spheres and our aim is to give sufficient conditions <lb/>on the function K such that equation ( K ) has multiple solutions. Our approach is based on the theory of the <lb/>critical points at infinity introduced by Bahri [30]. <lb/>This theory deals with the variational problems with lack of compactness, that is, when the associ-<lb/>ated Euler-Lagrange functionals do not satisfy the Palais-Smale condition. In fact, the Palais-Smale con-<lb/>dition is not the best tool to study variational problems. Indeed, if we try to detect the critical points <lb/>of a function by deforming one of its level sets onto the other by using the gradient flow, two types of <lb/>obstruction can occur: a stop at a critical point or the emergence of a critical point at infinity, that is, <lb/></body>

        <body>an orbit of the gradient along which the gradient goes to zero, the functional remains bounded, and the <lb/>orbit does not converge. The second case is forbidden by the Palais-Smale condition. Furthermore, the <lb/>Palais-Smale condition also excludes situations which do not represent any danger from a variational view-<lb/>point [30]. It therefore appears that the important thing is whether or not the Palais-Smale condition is satisfied <lb/>along the flow lines, that is, whether or not critical points at infinity exist. Thus, if we look for critical points of a <lb/>functional by studying the difference of topology between its level sets, we have to determine the critical points <lb/>at infinity in order to compute their contribution to the topological changes of the level sets. In the present paper, <lb/>we make a finer study of the topological contribution of the critical points at infinity which allows us to prove <lb/>the existence of several solutions of the problem ( K ) having their energies close to the same level set of the <lb/>functional J K . To state our results, we need to introduce some notation. <lb/>For 𝜀 &gt; 0, we set <lb/> 𝜀 = <lb/>{ <lb/>K: 𝕊 n → ℝ∕ 0 &lt; K ∈ C 3 (𝕊 n ) and <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>K max <lb/>K min <lb/>-1 <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>&lt; 𝜀 <lb/>} <lb/>, <lb/>where K max := max 𝕊 n K and K min := min 𝕊 n K. <lb/>We introduce the following non degeneracy conditions: <lb/>(H1) The critical points y&apos;s of K are non degenerate and satisfy ΔK(y) ≠ 0. <lb/>(H2) The critical points of J K are non degenerate. <lb/>(H3) m := # ∞ ≥ 2, where  ∞ := {y ∈ 𝕊 n : ∇K(y) = 0 and ΔK(y) &lt; 0} and #A denotes the cardinal <lb/>of A. <lb/>In the first part of this paper, we consider the case where the Euler-Poincaré index formula related to the <lb/>topological contribution of critical points of J K is different from 1, that is, B 1 ≠ 1 where <lb/>B 1 := <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ <lb/>(-1) 𝜄( y) where 𝜄(y) = n -morse index(K, y). <lb/>Taking N an arbitrary integer, our aim is to prove that, for 𝜀 small and 1 ≤ p ≤ N, problem ( K ) has <lb/>solutions whose energies are close to ( pS n ) 4∕n , where S n is defined by (49). Assume that  ∞ = {y 1 , … , y m } with <lb/>y 1 is a maximum point of K. Without loss of generality, we can assume that y 1 , … , y m are ordered so that we are <lb/>in one of the following four cases: <lb/>Case 1. 𝜄(y j ) is even for all j. <lb/>Case 2. 𝜄(y j ) is odd for all j ≥ 2. <lb/>Case 3. For some l ≥ 1 such that 2l ≤ m -2, we have <lb/>𝜄(y 2 j ) is odd and 𝜄(y 2 j+1 ) is even ∀j ∈ {1, … , 𝓁} and 𝜄(y j ) is even <lb/>∀ 2𝓁 + 2 ≤ j ≤ m. <lb/>Case 4. For some 𝓁 ≥ 1 such that 2𝓁 ≤ m -2, we have <lb/>𝜄(y 2 j ) is odd and 𝜄(y 2 j+1 ) is even ∀j ∈ {1, … , 𝓁} and 𝜄(y j ) is odd <lb/>∀ 2𝓁 + 2 ≤ j ≤ m. <lb/>Note that, in cases 3 and 4, we have used the fact that B 1 ≠ 1 which implies that m cannot be equal to 2𝓁 + 1 <lb/>and therefore: m ≥ 2𝓁 + 2. <lb/>In order to give the precise number of solutions obtained by our argument as well as their levels, we will <lb/>present our results for each of the above cases. Under the above notation, our first multiplicity results read as <lb/>follows: <lb/>Theorem 1.1. Let n ≥ 9 and N ∈ ℕ be an integer. There exists 𝜀 N &gt; 0 such that, if 0 &lt; 𝜀 &lt; 𝜀 N and K ∈  𝜀 <lb/>satisfying (H1), (H2), (H3), <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) ≠ 1 and the assumption stated in Case 1 or Case 2, then there hold: <lb/></body>

        <body>for any p ∈ {1, 2, … , N}, ( K ) has at least (m -1) solutions u 1, p , … , u m-1, p satisfying J K (u i, p ) ∈ <lb/>[ <lb/>( pS n (1 -𝜂)) 4∕n , ( pS n (1 + 𝜂)) 4∕n ] <lb/>for any i ∈ {1, … , m -1}, for some small positive constant 𝜂. In particular <lb/>( K ) has at least N(m -1) solutions. (Here and in the sequel S n denotes the constant defined by (49)). <lb/>Theorem 1.2. Let n ≥ 9 and N ∈ ℕ be an integer. There exists 𝜀 N &gt; 0 such that, if 0 &lt; 𝜀 &lt; 𝜀 N and K ∈  𝜀 <lb/>satisfying (H1), (H2), (H3), <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) ≠ 1 and the assumption stated in Case 3 or Case 4, then there exist at least <lb/>N solutions u 1 , . . . , u N of ( K ) satisfying J K (u p ) ∈ <lb/>[ <lb/>( pS n (1 -𝜂)) 4∕n , ( pS n (1 + 𝜂)) 4∕n ] <lb/>for each p ∈ {1, 2, … , N}, for <lb/>some small positive constant 𝜂. <lb/>Remark 1.3. If the cardinal of  ∞ is even then we have: <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) ≠ 1. <lb/>In the second part of this paper, we deal with the case where the above mentioned index counting formula <lb/>is equal to 1, that is <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) = 1. Note that, in this case, # ∞ has to be odd, say 2r + 1 with r + 1 points <lb/>having 𝜄(y) even and r points having 𝜄(y) odd. Furthermore, since we have assumed that # ∞ ≥ 2, we see that <lb/>r ≥ 1. In this part, we fail to prove the existence of solutions at each level set ( pS n ) 4∕n with 1 ≤ p ≤ N. How-<lb/>ever, we are able to show the existence of solutions of ( K ) whose energies are close to the level (2 pS n ) 4∕n for <lb/>1 ≤ p ≤ [ N <lb/>2 ]. More precisely, we have: <lb/>Theorem 1.4. Let n ≥ 9 and N ∈ ℕ be an integer. There exists 𝜀 N &gt; 0 such that, if 0 &lt; 𝜀 &lt; 𝜀 N and <lb/>K ∈  𝜀 satisfying (H1), (H2), (H3) and <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) = 1, then for any p ∈ {1, 2, … , [ N <lb/>2 ]}, ( K ) has at <lb/>least (m -1)∕2 solutions u 1, p , … , u (m-1)∕2, p satisfying J K (u i, p ) ∈ <lb/>[ <lb/>(2 pS n (1 -𝜂)) 4∕n , (2 pS n (1 + 𝜂)) 4∕n ] <lb/>for any <lb/>i ∈ {1, … , (m -1)∕2}, for some small positive constant 𝜂. In particular, ( K ) has at least [N∕2](m -1)∕2 <lb/>solutions. <lb/>The idea of the proof of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.4 is as follows: taking an arbitrary integer N ∈ ℕ and using <lb/>the Pinching condition introduced in the definition of  𝜀 , we first prove that, for 𝜀 small, the Euler-Poincaré <lb/>counting index formula related to the topological contribution of the critical points and the critical points at <lb/>infinity at the first level set of the associated variational functional is equal to 1 while the above mentioned <lb/>index counting formula related to the relative topological contribution of these critical points and critical points <lb/>at infinity at each level set going from 2 to N is equal to zero. Second, we compute the above mentioned index <lb/>counting formula related to the topological contribution of the critical points at infinity at the first level and then <lb/>two cases may occur: <lb/>1. If the above mentioned index counting formula is different from 1 (that means B 1 ≠ 1), we deduce the <lb/>existence of a solution 𝜔 whose energy is close to the first level. Since we have assumed that n ≥ 9, this <lb/>solution gives rise critical points at infinity (y i , 𝜔) (see Proposition 2.6 below) at the 2nd level with y i ∈  ∞ . <lb/>Thus, we have at this level two types of critical points at infinity: Some of them are of type (y i , y j ) with i ≠ j, <lb/>and others are of type (y i , 𝜔) <lb/>( <lb/>y i , y j ∈  ∞ ) <lb/>. But by computing the Euler-Poincaré counting index formula <lb/>related to the contribution of these critical points at infinity we see that it is different from 0. This shows the <lb/>existence of a solution whose energy is close to the second level. This argument is repeated up to the level <lb/>N, which proves the existence of at least N solutions. <lb/>2. If B 1 = 1, we cannot conclude the existence of solutions with energies close to the first level. But using <lb/>assumption (H3), we prove that this mentioned index counting formula is different from 0 at all even levels. <lb/>This gives the existence of solutions at all even levels. <lb/>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we set up the analytical framework of the associated <lb/>variational problem, recall some preliminaries and we give the characterization of the critical points at infinity. <lb/>Lastly, we prove our multiplicity results in Section 3. <lb/></body>

        <body>2 Preliminaries <lb/>This section is devoted to set up the analytical setting of the associated variational problem, to recall the lack of <lb/>compactness and to give the characterization of non converging orbits of the gradient flow, the so called critical <lb/>points at infinity. Note that ( K ) has a variational structure. Namely, the positive critical points of the functional <lb/>J K are in one to one correspondence with the solutions of ( K ). The functional J K fails to satisfy the Palais-Smale <lb/>condition. To recall this failure, we introduce the following notation. <lb/>For a ∈ 𝕊 n and 𝜆 &gt; 0, let <lb/>δ(a,𝜆) (x) = 𝛽 n <lb/>𝜆 (n-4)∕2 <lb/>( <lb/>2 + (𝜆 2 -1)(1 -cos d(x, a)) <lb/>) (n-4)∕2 , <lb/>where d is the geodesic distance on (𝕊 n , g) and 𝛽 n = [(n -4)(n -2)n(n + 2)] (n-4)∕8 . <lb/>It is well known that these functions are the solutions of the problem ([31]) <lb/>u = u (n+4)∕(n-4) , u &gt; 0, in 𝕊 n . <lb/>Let 𝜔 be a non degenerate positive critical point of J K , q ∈ ℕ and 𝜈 &gt; 0, we set <lb/>V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔) = <lb/>{ <lb/>u ∈ Σ + | ∃ a 1 , … , a q ∈ 𝕊 n , ∃ 𝜆 1 , … , 𝜆 q &gt; 𝜈 -1 , <lb/>∃ 𝛼 0 , 𝛼 1 , … , 𝛼 q &gt; 0 with <lb/>∥ u -<lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=1 <lb/>𝛼 i δ(a i ,𝜆 i ) -𝛼 0 𝜔 ∥&lt; 𝜈, 𝜀 i j &lt; 𝜈 ∀i ≠ j, <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>J K (u) <lb/>n <lb/>n-4 𝛼 <lb/>8 <lb/>n-4 <lb/>i K(a i ) -1 <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>&lt; 𝜈 ∀ i ≥ 1, |𝛼 0 J K (u) n∕8 -1| &lt; 𝜈 <lb/>} <lb/>, <lb/>where <lb/>Σ + := {u ∈ Σ: u &gt; 0} and <lb/>𝜀 i j = <lb/>( 𝜆 i <lb/>𝜆 j <lb/>+ <lb/>𝜆 j <lb/>𝜆 i <lb/>+ <lb/>𝜆 i 𝜆 j <lb/>2 <lb/>(1 -cos d(a i , a j )) <lb/>) (4-n)∕2 <lb/>. <lb/>We also set <lb/>(q, 𝜈, 𝜔) := <lb/>{ <lb/>(𝛼, a, 𝜆, h) ∈ ℝ q+1 × (𝕊 n ) q × (𝜈 -1 , ∞) q <lb/>× T 𝜔 (W u (𝜔)): c -1 ≤ 𝛼 i ≤ c, ∀ i, <lb/>‖h‖ ≤ c ′ and 𝜀 i j ≤ 𝜈 <lb/>} , <lb/>(4) <lb/>where c and c ′ are two positive constants and T 𝜔 (W u (𝜔)) denotes the tangent space at 𝜔 of the unstable manifold <lb/>W u (𝜔). <lb/>According to [21], we know that positive non converging Palais-Smale sequences have to enter some <lb/>V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔). To parametrize V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔), we follow the corresponding statement in [32]. Denoting by 𝜔 a non degen-<lb/>erate positive critical point of J K , we are going to prove the following result: <lb/>Proposition 2.1. For any q ∈ ℕ, there is 𝜈 q &gt; 0 such that if 0 &lt; 𝜈 ≤ 𝜈 q and u ∈ V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔), then the following <lb/>minimization problem <lb/>min <lb/>{ ‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>u -<lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=1 <lb/>𝛼 i δ(a i ,𝜆 i ) -𝛼 0 (𝜔 + h) <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>‖ <lb/>, 𝛼 i &gt; 0, 𝜆 i &gt; 𝜈 -1 , a i ∈ 𝕊 n , h ∈ T 𝜔 (W u (𝜔)) <lb/>} <lb/>(5) <lb/></body>

Let 𝜈 k &gt; 0 be a sequence with lim 𝜈 k = 0 and let (𝛼 k , a k , 𝜆 k , h k ) ∈ (q, 𝜈 k , 𝜔) and (α k , ãk , λk , hk ) ∈ <lb/>(q, 𝜈 k , 𝜔) be such that <lb/>lim <lb/>k→∞ <lb/>‖𝜑(𝛼 k , a k , 𝜆 k , h k ) -𝜑(α k , ãk , λk , hk )‖ = 0 <lb/>(6) <lb/>where 𝜑(𝛼, a, 𝜆, h) = <lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=1 <lb/>𝛼 i δa i ,𝜆 i + 𝛼 0 (𝜔 + h). <lb/>(7) <lb/>Then (modulo permutation on (α k , ãk , λk , hk )), <lb/>lim <lb/>k→∞ <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>λk <lb/>i <lb/>= 1 ∀ i ∈ {1, … , q}, <lb/>(8) <lb/>lim <lb/>k→∞ <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i d <lb/>( <lb/>a k <lb/>i , ãk <lb/>i <lb/>) = 0 ∀ i ∈ {1, … , q}, <lb/>(9) <lb/>lim <lb/>k→∞ <lb/>|𝛼 k <lb/>i -αk <lb/>i | = 0 ∀ i ∈ {0, 1, … , q}, <lb/>(10) <lb/>lim <lb/>k→∞ <lb/>‖h k -hk ‖ = 0. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Proof. For sake of simplicity, we will often omit the index k. We start by proving the following claim: <lb/>Claim: For each i ∈ {1, … , q}, there exists j(i) ∈ {1, … , q} such that <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>λk <lb/>j(i) <lb/>+ <lb/>λk <lb/>j(i) <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>+ 𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>λk <lb/>j(i) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(1 -cos(d <lb/>( <lb/>a k <lb/>i , ãk <lb/>j <lb/>) <lb/>)) is bounded. <lb/>(12) <lb/>The proof will be by contradiction.

Observe that, expanding the two functions when |x| is very large, we get <lb/>𝛿 b,μ (x) = <lb/>𝛽 n <lb/>μ(n-4)∕2 <lb/>(1 + μ2 [|x| 2 + | b| 2 -2⟨x, b⟩]) (n-4)∕2 <lb/>(25) <lb/>= <lb/>𝛽 n <lb/>μ(n-4)∕2 |x| n-4 <lb/>( <lb/>1 + (n -4) <lb/>⟨x, b⟩ <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>) ) <lb/>. <lb/>(26) <lb/>On the other hand, (21) implies that <lb/>Π -a (x) = -a + 2 <lb/>x <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>) <lb/>, for |x| very large <lb/>and therefore, we get <lb/>cos(d(b, Π -a (x))) = ⟨b, Π -a (x)⟩ = ⟨b, -a⟩ + 2 <lb/>⟨b, x⟩ <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>) <lb/>which implies that <lb/>2+(𝜇 2 -1)(1 -cos d(b, Π -a (x))) = 1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1)⟨b, -a⟩ -2(𝜇 2 -1) <lb/>⟨b, x⟩ <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>) <lb/>= <lb/>( <lb/>1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1)⟨b, -a⟩ <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>1 -2 <lb/>𝜇 2 -1 <lb/>1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1)⟨b, -a⟩ <lb/>⟨b, x⟩ <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>)) <lb/>. <lb/>Putting this expansion in the definition of 𝜄( δb,𝜇 ), for |x| very large, we obtain <lb/>𝜄( δb,𝜇 )(x) = <lb/>( <lb/>2 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>) n-4 <lb/>2 <lb/>( <lb/>1 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>)) <lb/>𝛽 n 𝜇 (n-4)∕2 <lb/>[1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1)⟨b, -a⟩] <lb/>n-4 <lb/>2 <lb/>× <lb/>( <lb/>1 + <lb/>(n -4)(𝜇 2 -1) <lb/>1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1)⟨b, -a⟩ <lb/>⟨b, x⟩ <lb/>|x| 2 + O <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>|x| 2 <lb/>)) <lb/>. <lb/>(27) <lb/></body>

        <body>Using (26) and (27), by identification, we get <lb/>μ = <lb/>1 <lb/>2𝜇 <lb/>( <lb/>1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1) cos d(b, -a) <lb/>) <lb/>and <lb/>b = <lb/>𝜇 2 -1 <lb/>1 + 𝜇 2 -(𝜇 2 -1) cos d(b, -a) <lb/>P ℝ n (b), <lb/>where P ℝ n (b) is the projection of b on ℝ n . Hence the proof of (2) is completed. <lb/>Finally, (3) follows from (22), (23) and Claims (1) and (2) by using the change of variables y = Π -a (x). This <lb/>ends the proof of the lemma. <lb/>■ <lb/>Now, we are ready to prove Proposition 2.1. <lb/>Proof of Proposition 2.1. From the definition of V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔), for u ∈ V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔), there exists (𝛽, b, 𝜇, h 0 ) ∈ <lb/>(q, 𝜈, 𝜔) satisfying the assumptions stated in (q, 𝜈, 𝜔) such that <lb/>‖u -𝜑(𝛽, b, 𝜇, h 0 )‖ &lt; 𝜈, <lb/>(28) <lb/>where 𝜑 is defined in (7). Note that the variables 𝛼, a, h in the minimizing problem (5) are in compact sets. <lb/>However 𝜆 ∈ (𝜈 -1 , ∞) q . But, by using Lemma 2.2 and (28), it follows that 𝜆 i has to be close to 𝜇 i for each <lb/>i ∈ {1, … , q}. Therefore, it has to be in a compact set. Thus the problem (5) has a minimizing solution (𝛼, a, 𝜆, h). <lb/>It remains to prove that this solution is unique, for 𝜈 small. For this aim, we argue by contradiction. Assume <lb/>that there exist 𝜈 k &gt; 0 (with 𝜈 k → 0) and u k ∈ V(q, 𝜈 k , 𝜔) such that the problem (5) is achieved by two <lb/>different solutions <lb/>(𝛼 k , a k , 𝜆 k , h k ) ≠ (α k , ãk , λk , hk ). <lb/>(29) <lb/>Denoting by 𝑣 k := u k -𝜑(𝛼 k , a k , 𝜆 k , h k ) and ṽk := u k -𝜑(α k , ãk , λk , hk ), it is easy to see that the following <lb/>hold <lb/>0 = ⟨𝑣 k , 𝜓⟩  = ⟨ṽ k , 𝜓⟩  ∀ 𝜓 ∈ T 𝜔 (W u (𝜔)), <lb/>(30) <lb/>0 = ⟨𝑣 k , 𝜔⟩  = ⟨ṽ k , 𝜔⟩  , <lb/>(31) <lb/>0 = ⟨𝑣 k , δa k <lb/>i ,𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>⟩  = ⟨ṽ k , δã k <lb/>i , λk <lb/>i <lb/>⟩  ∀ i ∈ {1, … , q}, <lb/>(32) <lb/>0 = ⟨𝑣 k , 𝜕 δa k <lb/>i ,𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>∕𝜕𝜆 k <lb/>i ⟩  = ⟨ṽ k , 𝜕 δã k <lb/>i , λk <lb/>i <lb/>∕𝜕 λk <lb/>i ⟩  ∀ i ∈ {1, … , q}, <lb/>(33) <lb/>0 = ⟨𝑣 k , 𝜕 δa k <lb/>i ,𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>∕𝜕 <lb/>( <lb/>a k <lb/>i <lb/>) <lb/>j ⟩  = ⟨ṽ k , 𝜕 δã k <lb/>i , λk <lb/>i <lb/>∕𝜕 <lb/>( ãk <lb/>i <lb/>) <lb/>j ⟩  <lb/>∀ i ∈ {1, … , q} ∀ j ∈ {1, … , n}. <lb/>(34) <lb/>Observe that, since ‖𝑣 k ‖ → 0 and ‖ṽ k ‖ → 0, we derive that <lb/>‖𝜑(𝛼 k , a k , 𝜆 k , h k ) -𝜑(α k , ãk , λk , hk )‖ = ‖𝑣 k -ṽk ‖ → 0 <lb/>and therefore, by using Lemma 2.2, we derive that (up permutation on (α k , ãk , λk , hk )), <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>λk <lb/>i <lb/>= 1 + o k (1); 𝜆 i d <lb/>( <lb/>a k <lb/>i , ãk <lb/>i <lb/>) = o k (1); |𝛼 k <lb/>i -αk <lb/>i | = o k (1) ∀ i; ‖h k -hk ‖ = o k (1). <lb/>(35) <lb/>In the following, we will denote by <lb/>∧ i,k := <lb/>𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>λk <lb/>i <lb/>-1; 𝜉 i,k := 𝜆 k <lb/>i <lb/>( <lb/>a k <lb/>i -ãk <lb/>i <lb/>) <lb/>; 𝜁 i,k := |𝛼 k <lb/>i -αk <lb/>i | ∀ i; 𝜃 k := 𝛼 k <lb/>0 h k -αk <lb/>0 hk . <lb/>(36) <lb/></body>

Hence the proof of the lemma is completed. <lb/>■ <lb/>Next, as in [34], we define the critical points at infinity of J K as follows: <lb/>Definition 2.5. A critical point at infinity of J K in Σ + := {u ∈ Σ: u &gt; 0} is defined as a limit of the flow-line <lb/>u(s) of the equation 𝜕u <lb/>𝜕s = -∇J K (u), u 0 ∈ Σ + such that, for s large, u(s) remains in V(q, 𝜈(s), 𝜔), where q ∈ ℕ, <lb/>𝜈(s) tends to zero as s tends to ∞ and 𝜔 is zero or a positive critical point of J K . By Proposition 2.1, u(s) can be <lb/>written as <lb/>u(s) = <lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=1 <lb/>𝛼 i (s) δ(a i (s),𝜆 i (s)) + 𝛼 0 (s)(𝜔 + h(s)) + 𝑣(s). <lb/>Denoting a i = lim s→+∞ a i (s), (a 1 , … , a q , 𝜔) ∞ is called a critical point at infinity of J K . When 𝜔 ≠ 0, we call <lb/>(a 1 , … , a q , 𝜔) ∞ a mixed type of critical point at infinity of J K . <lb/>Note that, on the contrary to the case where n ≤ 7, when n ≥ 9, any solution 𝜔 of ( K ) and a collection <lb/>of critical points y i of K having ΔK(y i ) &lt; 0 create a critical point at infinity of J K . For n = 8, a balance phe-<lb/>nomenon appears; that is, the self-interaction of the functions δa i ,𝜆 i and the scalar product ⟨ δa i ,𝜆 i , 𝜔⟩ are of the <lb/>same size. For n ≥ 9, we have the following characterization of the critical points at infinity. <lb/>Proposition 2.6. Let n ≥ 9. Then, the only critical points at infinity of J K correspond to <lb/>(y i 1 , … , y i q , 𝜔) ∞ and (y i 1 , … , y i q ) ∞ , <lb/>where {y i 1 , … , y i q } are any collections of q critical points of K in 𝕊 n satisfying ΔK(y i k ) &lt; 0 and 𝜔 is a non-<lb/>degenerate positive critical point of J K . <lb/>The Morse index of these critical points (i.e. the number of the decreasing directions for J K ) are equal to <lb/>i ∞ (y i 1 , … , y i q , 𝜔) := index(𝜔) + q + <lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>k=1 <lb/>(n -morse index(K, y i k )), <lb/>i ∞ (y i 1 , … , y i q ) := q -1 + <lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>k=1 <lb/>(n -morse index(K, y i k )). <lb/>Furthermore, the levels of these critical points at infinity are given by <lb/>C ∞ (y i 1 , … , y i q ) := S 4∕n <lb/>n <lb/>( q <lb/>∑ <lb/>k=1 <lb/>1 <lb/>K(y i k ) (n-4)∕4 <lb/>) 4∕n <lb/>710 -M.

El Mehdi: Q-curvature <lb/>C ∞ (y i 1 , … , y i q , 𝜔) := <lb/>( <lb/>S n <lb/>q <lb/>∑ <lb/>k=1 <lb/>1 <lb/>K(y i k ) (n-4)∕4 + ‖𝜔‖ 2 <lb/>) 4∕n <lb/>, <lb/>where S n is defined by <lb/>S n = ∫ <lb/>ℝ n <lb/>𝛿 2n∕(n-4) <lb/>(0,1) <lb/>. <lb/>(49) <lb/>Proof. For 𝜔 = 0, the result is extracted from [10], (see Proposition 3.2). For 𝜔 ≠ 0, the characterization of the <lb/>critical points at infinity and their Morse index are proved in Proposition 3.3 of [16]. We notice that in [16], the <lb/>author assumed that K has only two critical points with ΔK &lt; 0. However its proof is done in the general case. <lb/>Concerning the level C ∞ (y i 1 , … , y i q , 𝜔), using Proposition 5.1 of [16] and the fact that u := <lb/>∑ q <lb/>i=1 𝛼 i δi + 𝛼 0 (𝜔 + <lb/>h) + 𝑣 ∈ V(q, 𝜈, 𝜔) with a i close to a critical point y i for each i, we have <lb/>J K (u) = <lb/>S n <lb/>∑ 𝛼 2 <lb/>i + 𝛼 2 <lb/>0 ‖𝜔‖ 2 <lb/>( <lb/>S n <lb/>∑ 𝛼 2n∕(n-4) <lb/>i <lb/>K(a i ) + 𝛼 2n∕(n-4) <lb/>0 <lb/>‖𝜔‖ 2 <lb/>) (n-4)∕n (1 + o(1)) <lb/>= <lb/>( <lb/>S n <lb/>∑ <lb/>1 <lb/>K(y i ) (n-4)∕4 + ‖𝜔‖ 2 <lb/>) 4∕n <lb/>(1 + o(1)). <lb/>This achieves the proof of the proposition. <lb/>■ <lb/>3 Proof of the theorems <lb/>This section is devoted to the proof of our results. Their proofs are basically based on some deformation argu-<lb/>ments. To see the effect of the pinching condition in  𝜀 on the level sets of the functional J K , we start by proving <lb/>the following proposition which is crucial in the sequel. <lb/>Proposition 3.1. Let N ∈ ℕ and 𝜂 be a positive constant satisfying 𝜂 &lt; 2∕(2N + 1).

Notice that, in 𝕊 n , the only positive solutions of ( 1 ) (that is ( K ) with K ≡ 1) are the functions δ(a,𝜆) with <lb/>a ∈ 𝕊 n and 𝜆 &gt; 0 [31]. Furthermore, it follows from the characterization of the lack of compactness for J 1 (see <lb/>[21]), each Palais-Smale sequence (u q ) q (under the level (N + 1) 4∕n S 4∕n <lb/>n ) has to be close to a sum of δi and therefore <lb/>J 1 (u q ) will be close to k 4∕n × S 4∕n <lb/>n for some k ≤ N.

Then the result <lb/>follows from (52). <lb/>■ <lb/>Next, we are going to study the contribution of solutions in the Euler-Poincaré characteristic formulae. We <lb/>notice that, from (50) and (51), under the level ((N + 1)S n ) 4∕n , each positive critical point 𝜔 of J K (if it exists) has <lb/>to satisfy <lb/>J K (𝜔) ∈ ∪ N <lb/>k=1 <lb/>[ <lb/>(kS n (1 -𝜂)) 4∕n , (kS n (1 + 𝜂)) 4∕n ] <lb/>. <lb/>In the sequel, if J K (𝜔) ∈ <lb/>[ <lb/>(kS n (1 -𝜂)) 4∕n , (kS n (1 + 𝜂)) 4∕n ] <lb/>, we say that the level of 𝜔 is close to (kS n ) 4∕n . Now, <lb/>to proceed further, we need to introduce some notation. Let m be the cardinal of the set  ∞ defined in (H3) and <lb/>for y ∈  ∞ , we denote by <lb/>𝜄(y) = n -morse index (K, y). <lb/>Suppose that  ∞ = {y 1 , … , y m } with y 1 is a maximum point of K. <lb/>In the sequel, denoting by 𝜔 k a positive critical point of J K having an energy close to (kS n ) 4∕n , we will use <lb/>the following notation: <lb/> p ;  ∞, p <lb/>≥k <lb/>and  <lb/>∞, p <lb/>≥k;k <lb/>(53) <lb/>to denote <lb/>- p : the set of positive critical points 𝜔 p of J K , <lb/>- <lb/>∞, p <lb/>≥k : the critical points at infinity 𝜔 ∞,p having the form (y i 1 , … , y i p ) ∞ with k ≤ i 1 &lt; … &lt; i p or <lb/>(y i 1 , … , y i r , 𝜔 p-r ) ∞ with 1 ≤ r &lt; p and k ≤ i 1 &lt; … &lt; i r , <lb/>- <lb/>∞, p <lb/>≥k;k : the subset of  <lb/>∞, p <lb/>≥k satisfying i 1 = k. <lb/>We remark that, if k &gt; m, then  ∞, p <lb/>≥k = ∅.

        <body>Remark 3.2. <lb/>-The number of positive critical points of J K (hence the number of solutions of ( K )) having an energy close <lb/>to ( pS n ) 4∕n is at least equal to |𝜇 p |. <lb/>-SinceΣ + is invariant under the gradient flow [19], the solutions obtained by our argument are positive. <lb/>-The variational solutions of ( K ) are regular [35]. <lb/>In the next two lemmas, we provide some useful information on 𝜇 p , 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k and 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k;k . <lb/>Lemma 3.3. Under the above notation, for each k ≥ 1, it holds <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k = 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k;k + 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k+1 <lb/>and <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k;k = -(-1) 𝜄( y k ) <lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>. <lb/>(54) <lb/>Proof. First, we remark that, for 𝜔 ∞, p ∈  ∞, p <lb/>≥k , two cases may occur: <lb/>-either y k does not appear in the configuration of 𝜔 ∞,p . In this case, 𝜔 ∞, p ∈  ∞, p <lb/>≥k+1 . <lb/>-or y k appears in the configuration of 𝜔 ∞,p . In this case, 𝜔 ∞, p ∈  ∞, p <lb/>≥k;k . <lb/>This implies the first claim of the lemma. <lb/>Second, the above second situation can be divided in three subcases: <lb/>-𝜔 ∞, p = (y k , 𝜔 p-1 ) ∞ and in this case, by Proposition 2.6, we have <lb/>(-1) morse index(𝜔 ∞, p ) = -(-1) 𝜄( y k ) (-1) morse index(𝜔 p-1 ) . <lb/>-𝜔 ∞, p = (y k , y i 2 , … , y i p ) ∞ with k &lt; i 2 &lt; … &lt; i p . Note that 𝜔 ∞, p-1 := (y i 2 , … , y i p ) ∞ ∈  ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥k+1 <lb/>and <lb/>Proposition 2.6 implies that <lb/>(-1) morse index( J K ,𝜔 ∞, p ) = -(-1) 𝜄( y k ) (-1) morse index( J K ,𝜔 ∞, p-1 ) . <lb/>-𝜔 ∞, p = (y k , y i 2 , … , y i r , 𝜔 p-r ) ∞ <lb/>with <lb/>k &lt; i 2 &lt; … &lt; i r <lb/>and <lb/>2 ≤ r &lt; p. <lb/>Note <lb/>that <lb/>𝜔 ∞, p-1 := (y i 2 , … , y i r , 𝜔 p-r ) ∞ ∈  ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥k+1 and Proposition 2.6 implies that <lb/>(-1) morse index( J K ,𝜔 ∞, p ) = -(-1) 𝜄( y k ) (-1) morse index( J K ,𝜔 ∞, p-1 ) . <lb/>Hence the proof of the second claim of (54) is complete. <lb/>■ <lb/>Lemma 3.4. With the above notation, we have <lb/>(i) 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥1 + 𝜇 1 = 1 <lb/>and <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥1 + 𝜇 p = 0 ∀ p ≥ 2. <lb/>(55) <lb/>(ii) 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2 + 𝜇 p = 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>(56) <lb/>Proof. The proof is based on the deformation of the level sets of J K in Σ + := {u ∈ Σ: u &gt; 0}. Taking u 0 ∈ <lb/>J <lb/>[ pS n (1+𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>:= <lb/>{ <lb/>u ∈ Σ + : J K (u) ≤ [ pS n (1 + 𝜂)] 4∕n } <lb/>, we consider the flow <lb/>⎧ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎨ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎩ <lb/>𝜕u <lb/>𝜕s <lb/>= -∇J K (u(s)) = -2 J K (u) <lb/>( <lb/>u -J K (u) <lb/>n <lb/>n-4  -1 <lb/>( <lb/>K|u| <lb/>8 <lb/>n-4 u <lb/>)) <lb/>u(0) = u 0 . <lb/>Notice that Σ + is invariant under the above flow [19]. Now, if we use the above flow in order to deform the <lb/>level set J <lb/>[ pS n (1+𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>onto the level set J <lb/>[ pS n (1-𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>, we see that three cases may occur: <lb/>-there exists s 1 &gt; such that u(s 1 , u 0 ) ∈ J [ pS n (1-𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>. <lb/>-a stop at a critical point of J K and since Σ + is invariant under the flow, such a critical point is positive. <lb/></body>

        <body>-the emergence of a critical point at infinity, that is, for s large, the flow line u(s, u 0 ) enters and remains in <lb/>V(q, 𝜈(s), 𝜔), where q ∈ ℕ, 𝜈(s) tends to zero as s tends to ∞ and 𝜔 is zero or a positive critical point of J K . <lb/>Thus, the Euler-Poincaré theorem implies that <lb/>𝜒( J [ pS n (1+𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>) = 𝜒( J [ pS n (1-𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>) + 𝜇 p + 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥1 <lb/>for p ≥ 2, <lb/>𝜒( J <lb/>S <lb/>4∕n <lb/>n (1+𝜂) 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>) = 𝜇 1 + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥1 . <lb/>Furthermore, Proposition 3.1 implies that J <lb/>[ pS n (1+𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>and J <lb/>[ pS n (1-𝜂)] 4∕n <lb/>K <lb/>are contractible sets. Therefore, Claim <lb/>(i) follows. <lb/>Now, using (54) and (55), we derive that <lb/>(-1) 𝜄( y 1 ) + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥2 + 𝜇 1 = 1 and -(-1) 𝜄( y 1 ) <lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥2 <lb/>+ 𝜇 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2 + 𝜇 p = 0 ∀ p ≥ 2. <lb/>(57) <lb/>Since we have assumed that y 1 is a maximum point of K, it has to satisfy ΔK(y 1 ) &lt; 0 and 𝜄(y 1 ) = 0 is even. <lb/>This implies that the first equation in (57) is equivalent to 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥2 + 𝜇 1 = 0. However, denoting by x p := 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2 + 𝜇 p , <lb/>we see that the second equation in (57) is equivalent to x p = x p-1 for each p ≥ 2. Thus, we obtain Claim (56) <lb/>which completes the proof of the lemma. <lb/>■ <lb/>In the next remark, we explain the importance of the assumption (H3) in our argument. <lb/>Remark 3.5. If  ∞ is reduced to a point, we have 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2 = 0 for any p ≥ 1. This implies that 𝜇 p = 0 for any <lb/>p ≥ 1. Hence we cannot deduce the existence of solutions of ( K ). <lb/>In the sequel, we assume that m := # ∞ ≥ 2. Next we are going to prove the following crucial Lemmas. <lb/>Lemma 3.6. Assume that 𝜄(y j ) is even for each j ≥ 2. Then it holds that <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k + 𝜇 p &lt; 0 ∀ p ≥ 1 ∀ 3 ≤ k ≤ m + 1. <lb/>(58) <lb/>Furthermore, we have <lb/>𝜇 p ≤ -(m -1) <lb/>∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>Proof. Using (54) with k = 2, (56) becomes <lb/>1 + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥3 + 𝜇 1 = 0 and -<lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥3 <lb/>+ 𝜇 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥3 + 𝜇 p = 0 ∀ p ≥ 2 <lb/>which implies that the sequence <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥3 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>p≥1 <lb/>is constant. Thus we get <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥3 + 𝜇 p = -1 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>(59) <lb/>Therefore (58) holds for k = 3. By induction, assume that (58) is true for k, i.e.: <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k + 𝜇 p &lt; 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>(60) <lb/>Arguing as before, using (54) and (60), it holds: <lb/>1 + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 1 &lt; 0 and -<lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 p &lt; 0 ∀ p ≥ 2, <lb/>which implies that <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 1 &lt; -1 and <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>&lt; <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k+1 + 𝜇 1 <lb/>) <lb/>∀ p ≥ 2. <lb/></body>

We will prove the lemma by induction on j.

Thus we deduce that <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥3 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>= (-1) p+1 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>(62) <lb/>Now, using (54), (62) and the fact that 𝜄(y 3 ) is even, we deduce that <lb/>1 + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥4 + 𝜇 1 = 1 and -<lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p-1 <lb/>≥4 <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥4 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>= (-1) p+1 ∀ p ≥ 2. <lb/>(63) <lb/>Denoting by z p := 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥4 + 𝜇 p and using (63), we see that <lb/>z k = <lb/>k <lb/>∑ <lb/>j=2 <lb/>(z j -z j-1 ) = <lb/>k <lb/>∑ <lb/>j=2 <lb/>(-1) j+1 = <lb/>⎧ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎨ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎩ <lb/>0 if k is odd <lb/>-1 if k is even <lb/>. <lb/>Thus we obtain <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥4 + 𝜇 1 = 0; <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥4 <lb/>+ 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>= -1 and <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p+1 <lb/>≥4 <lb/>+ 𝜇 2 p+1 <lb/>) <lb/>= 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>Hence, we obtain the desired result for j = 1. <lb/>Now, we will assume that the result holds for j -1 ≤ 𝓁 0 -1 and we need to prove it for j.

        <body>Then it holds: <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 1 &gt; 0; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 2 p &lt; 0 and 𝜇 ∞,2 p+1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 2 p+1 &gt; 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>Furthermore, if 𝜄(y j ) is odd for each j ≥ 2, it holds that <lb/>𝜇 2 p ≤ -(m -1) ∀ 1 ≤ p ≤ [N∕2]; 𝜇 2 p-1 ≥ (m -1) ∀ 1 ≤ p ≤ [(N + 1)∕2]. <lb/>Proof. The first claim follows immediately from the fact that 𝜄(y k 0 ) is odd and 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k 0 <lb/>= (-1) 𝜄( y k 0 ) + 𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 . For the <lb/>other claims, using (54), it holds: <lb/>0 ≥ <lb/>p <lb/>∑ <lb/>j=2 <lb/>(-1) j <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, j <lb/>≥k 0 <lb/>+ 𝜇 j <lb/>) <lb/>= <lb/>p <lb/>∑ <lb/>j=2 <lb/>(-1) j <lb/>([ <lb/>𝜇 ∞, j-1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 j-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, j <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 j <lb/>)) <lb/>= (-1) p <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 1 <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>which implies that (-1) p <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 p <lb/>) <lb/>&lt; 0. The first claim of the lemma is thereby proved. <lb/>Concerning the second claim, by using the first one, we see that <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥k 0 <lb/>+ 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>= <lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p-1 <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 2 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>&gt; <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥k 0 +1 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>∀ p ≥ 1 <lb/>which implies that <lb/>𝜇 2 p = 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥m+1 + 𝜇 2 p &lt; … &lt; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 <lb/>+ 𝜇 2 p = 0. <lb/>Therefore, we deduce that <lb/>𝜇 2 p ≤ -(m -1) ∀ 1 ≤ p ≤ [N∕2]. <lb/>In the same way we prove that <lb/>𝜇 2 p-1 ≥ (m -1) ∀ 1 ≤ p ≤ [(N + 1)∕2]. <lb/>Thus the proof of the lemma is complete. <lb/>■ <lb/>Now, we are ready to prove our results. We start by considering the case where the Euler-Poincaré index <lb/>formula is equal to 1. <lb/>Proof of Theorem 1.4. We assume that B 1 := <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) = 1. In this case, # ∞ has to be odd, say 2r + 1 with <lb/>r + 1 points having 𝜄(y) even and r points having 𝜄(y) odd. Furthermore, since we have assumed that # ∞ ≥ 2, <lb/>we deduce that r ≥ 1. In addition, since # ∞ = 2r + 1, we derive that 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2r+2 = 0 for each p ≥ 1. <lb/>Now, we order the points y k &apos;s of  ∞ such that 𝜄(y 1 ), 𝜄(y 3 ), . . . ., 𝜄(y 2r+1 ) are even and 𝜄(y 2 ), 𝜄(y 4 ), . . . ., 𝜄(y 2r ) are <lb/>odd. Applying (54), we deduce that <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 j + 𝜇 2 p = <lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p-1 <lb/>≥2 j+1 + 𝜇 2 p-1 <lb/>] <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 j+1 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>= -<lb/>[ <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p-2 <lb/>≥2 j+2 + 𝜇 2 p-2 <lb/>] <lb/>+ <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 j+2 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>Using Lemma 3.7, we obtain <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 j + 𝜇 2 p &gt; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 j+2 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>which implies that <lb/>𝜇 2 p = 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2r+2 + 𝜇 2 p &lt; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2r + 𝜇 2 p &lt; … &lt; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2 <lb/>+ 𝜇 2 p = 0. <lb/></body>

        <body>Therefore we obtain <lb/>𝜇 2 p ≤ -r := -(# ∞ -1)∕2. <lb/>In addition, applying Lemma 3.7 with j = l 0 = r, we deduce that <lb/>𝜇 2 p+1 = 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>Hence the proof of the theorem is completed. <lb/>■ <lb/>Next, we consider the case where B 1 := <lb/>∑ <lb/>y∈ ∞ (-1) 𝜄( y) ≠ 1. More precisely, our aim is to prove Theorems 1.1 <lb/>and 1.2. <lb/>Proof of Theorem 1.1. We assume that the assumption stated in Case 1 or Case 2 is satisfied, that is, we assume <lb/>that y 1 , … , y m are ordered so that we are in one of the following two cases: <lb/>Case 1. 𝜄(y j ) is even for all j. <lb/>Case 2. 𝜄(y j ) is odd for all j ≥ 2. <lb/>-In Case 1, i.e. all the points y k &apos;s of  ∞ satisfy: 𝜄(y k ) is even. Using Lemma 3.6, we derive that 𝜇 p ≤ -(m -1) <lb/>for each p ≥ 1 and therefore, at each level ( pS n ) 4∕n with p ≤ N, there exist at least (m -1) solutions of <lb/>( K ). <lb/>-In Case 2, i.e. we assume that 𝜄(y k ) is odd for each k ≥ 2. Using Lemma 3.9, we derive that, at each level <lb/>( pS n ) 4∕n with p ≤ N, ( K ) has at least (m -1) solutions. <lb/>This completes the proof of the theorem. <lb/>■ <lb/>Proof of Theorem 1.2. We assume that the assumption stated in Case 3 or Case 4 is satisfied, that is, we assume <lb/>that y 1 , … , y m are ordered so that we are in one of the following two cases: <lb/>Case 3. For some l ≥ 1 such that 2l ≤ m -2, we have <lb/>𝜄(y 2 j ) is odd and 𝜄(y 2 j+1 ) is even ∀j ∈ {1, … , 𝓁} and <lb/>𝜄(y j ) is even ∀ 2𝓁 + 2 ≤ j ≤ m. <lb/>Case 4. For some 𝓁 ≥ 1 such that 2𝓁 ≤ m -2, we have <lb/>𝜄(y 2 j ) is odd and 𝜄(y 2 j+1 ) is even ∀j ∈ {1, … , 𝓁} and 𝜄(y j ) is odd ∀ 2𝓁 + 2 ≤ j ≤ m. <lb/>Note that, since B 1 ≠ 1, m cannot be equal to 2𝓁 + 1 and therefore: m ≥ 2𝓁 + 2. <lb/>-In Case 3, we know that 𝜄(y 2k+1 ) is even and 𝜄(y 2k ) is odd for each k ≤ 𝓁 and 𝜄(y j ) is even for each <lb/>j ≥ 2𝓁 + 2. Applying Lemma 3.7 for 𝓁 0 = 𝓁, we have <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥2𝓁+2 + 𝜇 1 = 0; <lb/>( <lb/>𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2𝓁+2 + 𝜇 2 p <lb/>) <lb/>&lt; 0 and 𝜇 ∞,2 p+1 <lb/>≥2𝓁+2 + 𝜇 2 p+1 = 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/>(66) <lb/>Now we notice that (66) implies that the assumptions of Lemma 3.8 are satisfied for k 0 = 2𝓁 + 2 <lb/>and therefore we deduce that 𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥2𝓁+3 + 𝜇 p &lt; 0 for each p ≥ 1. Again, the assumptions of Lemma 3.8 are <lb/>satisfied for k 0 = 2𝓁 + 3. Hence by induction we deduce that <lb/>𝜇 ∞, p <lb/>≥m+1 + 𝜇 p = 𝜇 p &lt; 0 for each p ≥ 1. <lb/>Thus the existence of at least one solution of ( K ) at each level ( pS n ) 4∕n with p ≤ N. <lb/>-In Case 4, we know that 𝜄(y 2k+1 ) is even and 𝜄(y 2k ) is odd for each k ≤ 𝓁 and 𝜄(y j ) is odd for each j ≥ 2𝓁 + 2. <lb/>Clearly, in this case, assumptions of Lemma 3.7 are satisfied for 𝓁 0 = 𝓁. Thus, we see that (66) holds in this <lb/>case. Hence, applying Lemma 3.9 with k 0 = 2𝓁 + 2, we get <lb/>𝜇 ∞,1 <lb/>≥2𝓁+3 + 𝜇 1 &gt; 0; 𝜇 ∞,2 p <lb/>≥2𝓁+3 + 𝜇 2 p &lt; 0 and 𝜇 ∞,2 p+1 <lb/>≥2𝓁+3 + 𝜇 2 p+1 &gt; 0 ∀ p ≥ 1. <lb/></body>

        <body>Observe that the assumptions of Lemma 3.9 are again satisfied for k 0 = 2𝓁 + 3, then by induction, we get <lb/>that 𝜇 2 p-1 &gt; 0 and 𝜇 2 p &lt; 0 for each p ≥ 1. Hence the existence of at least one solution of ( K ) at each <lb/>level ( pS n ) 4∕n with p ≤ N. <lb/>The proof of the theorem is thereby completed. <lb/>■ <lb/></body>
