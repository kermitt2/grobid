			<front>C A S E R E P O R T <lb/>Open Access <lb/>A successful pregnancy and parturition in a <lb/>patient with anuria undergoing maintenance <lb/>hemodialysis for 6 years: a case report of a <lb/>3-year-follow-up <lb/>Panxi Yu 1,2 , Wenqi Diao 2,3 , Qionglan Tang 4 and Xuefeng Jiang 5* <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: Pregnancies in hemodialysis patients are uncommon and difficult to study. Although the chance of a <lb/>successful pregnancy and parturition in hemodialysis women has increased over the years, it still remains extremely <lb/>low with a high maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rate. <lb/>Case presentation: We reported a case of successful pregnancy and parturition in a 22-year-old Chinese female in <lb/>uremic stage of chronic renal failure and undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (three sessions a week) for 6 years. <lb/>At the 22nd gestational week, she was diagnosed as pregnant by ultrasound, and started an enhanced hemodialysis <lb/>routine (Five sessions a week). At the 32nd gestational week, she got hospitalized and received hemodialysis more <lb/>frequently (seven sessions a week). Based on the initial diagnoses, including uremic stage of chronic renal failure, <lb/>stage-3 hypertension, single pregnancy of 32nd gestational week, single umbilical artery and polyhydramnios, a <lb/>drug therapy consisting of compound amino acid, fructosediphosphate sodium, 10 % L-carnitine, erythropoietin, <lb/>polyferose, amlodipine, isosorbidedinitrate, low-molecular weight-heparin, multivitamins and folic acid was given, <lb/>and daily examination of the mother and fetus was performed. Under the joint efforts of various departments, <lb/>the patient underwent caesarean section at the 34th gestational week due to progressive uterine contraction and <lb/>gave birth to a female, well-being baby weighing 1470 g. It has been more than 3 years since the parturition. The <lb/>mother has returned to the previous hemodialysis routine, and the child has been growing up healthily. <lb/>Conclusion: Although pregnancy in hemodialysis patients is rare, with a high rate of risks. Patients could still gain <lb/>a good outcome, if we intensify hemodialysis and enhance the collaboration between the patient, nephrologists, <lb/>obstetricians, neonatologist, nutritionists, and other departments. <lb/>Keywords: Pregnancy, Hemodialysis, Chronic renal failure <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>Pregnancies in hemodialysis (HD) patients are rare [1], <lb/>although the incidence of these pregnancies has increased <lb/>since 1971 Confortini reported the first successful case [2]. <lb/>And compared to normal population, there is a very high <lb/>maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rate in pregnant <lb/>women undergoing HD [3, 4]. In order to achieve a success-<lb/>ful birth, this situation requires the joint efforts of the patient, <lb/>nephrologists, obstetricians, neonatologists, nutritionists and <lb/>other departments [3]. Here we reported a case of successful <lb/>pregnancy and parturition in a HD patient who was in <lb/>uremic stage of chronic renal failure (CRF) and reviewed the <lb/>associated literatures. <lb/>Case presentation <lb/>General information <lb/>The patient was a Chinese woman, 22 years old, married <lb/>and nulliparous. The time scale of the patient care was <lb/>shown in (Fig. 1). <lb/>Past medical history <lb/>At the age of 11 (Year 2001), the patient was diagnosed with <lb/>chronic glomerulonephritis and stage-3 hypertension <lb/></body>

			<body>without a definite etiology. She irregularly took Chinese <lb/>herbs (details were unknown) hoping to alleviate the pro-<lb/>gression of the diseases. Probably due to the treatment <lb/>&quot;nonfeasance&quot;, at her age of 16, she stepped into the uremic <lb/>stage of CRF. And in order to ease the disease progression, <lb/>she started to take 5 mg of amlodipine each day and initi-<lb/>ated a routine HD three sessions a week. Since November <lb/>2011, the patient started to noticea progressive distending <lb/>pain of the abdomen, and was found pregnant for 22 gesta-<lb/>tional weeks (GWs) with polyhydramnios (Amniotic Fluid <lb/>Index-AFI, was unknown) by ultrasound. From that on, her <lb/>HD routine was enhanced into five sessions a week. <lb/>Admission condition <lb/>On 19th January 2012, the patient came to our hospital. <lb/>A comprehensive examination was performed.

			<body>pressure was 152/86 mmHg, body weight 56.6 kg, <lb/>height 146.7 cm, and a calculated body mass index was <lb/>26.3 kg/m 2 . Her blood tests were: Blood Urea Nitrogen <lb/>(BUN)13.02 mmol/L, Serum Creatinine (Cr) 422 μg/L, <lb/>Hemoglobin (Hb) 94 g/L, Hematocrit (Hct) 27 %, Serum <lb/>Ferritin (SF) 10.8 μg/L, Red Blood Cell (RBC) 3.35 × 10 12 /L, <lb/>Platelet (PLT) 186 × 10 9 /L, D-Dimer (DD) 0.43 mg/L FEU, <lb/>Total Protein (TP) 58.8 g/L, Albumin (ALB) 32.6 g/L, <lb/>Serum Potassium (K) 3.7 mmol/L, Serum Sodium (Na) <lb/>137 mmol/L, Serum Chlorine (Cl) 103 mmol/L, Serum <lb/>Calcium (Ca) 2.08 mmol/L, Creatine Kinase (CK) 95 U/L, <lb/>Creatine Kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) 0.6 μg/L, Cardiac <lb/>Troponin I (cTnI) 0.004 μg/L, and N-Terminal pro-Brain <lb/>Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) 124 pg/ml. Abdominal <lb/>ultrasound revealed: single pregnancy of 32 GWs, single <lb/>umbilical artery, polyhydramnios (AFI 19.5) and fetal growth <lb/>restriction (the fetus was as large as that of 29GWs). <lb/>Initial treatment protocol <lb/>According to the examination results and past medical his-<lb/>tory, the patient was initially diagnosed with: CRF (uremic <lb/>stage), stage-3 hypertension, single pregnancy of 32GWs, <lb/>single umbilical artery, polyhydramnios, fetal growth restric-<lb/>tion, and slight anemia. In order to afford a comprehensive <lb/>treatment, nephrologists, obstetricians, neonatologists, nutri-<lb/>tionists and cardiovascular department together established <lb/>the following therapeutic regimen: <lb/>Daily HD of 240 min was performed on the patient, <lb/>followed by intravenous supplement of 250 ml of com-<lb/>pound amino acid, 20 ml of 10 % L-carnitine, and 10 g of <lb/>fructose diphosphate sodium. 5 mg of amlodipine and <lb/>0.296 g of isosorbidedinitrate were given per day to control <lb/>the blood pressure. 0.4 mg of folic acid and 150 mg of poly-<lb/>ferose each day and 300 IU of erythropoietin (EPO) twice a <lb/>week were applied to alleviate anemia. Additionally, close <lb/>observation of maternal and fetal conditions was required: <lb/>auscultation of fetal heart rate (FHR), calculation of fetal <lb/>movement, maternal electrocardiogram (ECG), check of <lb/>maternal vital signs, measurement of maternal abdominal <lb/>circumference, and maternal blood tests were strictly per-<lb/>formed each day. Color Doppler ultrasound was performed <lb/>once a week. Non-Stress-Test (NST) was performed 3 <lb/>times a week. Additionally, blood examination of myocar-<lb/>dial enzymes was executed in case of heart failure. <lb/>Disease progression <lb/>From 4th February 2012, the patient started feeling ab-<lb/>dominal intending pain with paroxysmal severe abdominal <lb/>cramps. Abdominal ultrasound was performed, indicating: <lb/>single pregnancy of 34 +1 GWs, single umbilical artery, <lb/>fetal growth restriction, and polyhydramnios (AFI 22.9). <lb/>The blood tests were: BUN 14.19 mmol/L, Cr368 μg/L, <lb/>Hb 90 g/L, Hct 24 %, SF 11.3 μg/L, RBC 3.26 × 10 12 /L, <lb/>PLT 194 × 10 9 /L, DD 0.24 mg/L FEU, TP 56.8 g/L, ALB <lb/>32.3 g/L, K 3.5 mmol/L, Na 139 mmol/L, Cl 108 mmol/L, <lb/>Ca 2.20 mmol/L, CK 75 U/L, CK-MB 0.3 μg/L, cTnI <lb/>0.000 μg/L, NT-proBNP 119 pg/ml. NST confirmed that <lb/>the paroxysmal abdominal pain was due to uterine contrac-<lb/>tion, indicating a great risk of premature birth. To facilitate <lb/>the maturation of fetal lungs, 6 mg of dexamethasone twice <lb/>a day was given to the patient intramuscularly for 2 days. <lb/>On 7th February 2012 (at the 34 +4th GW), no fetal <lb/>movement was observed, and a non-reaction type of <lb/>NST was presented. The baseline of FHR was 145 beats <lb/>per minute, without obvious FHR fluctuation even during <lb/>HD. Intrauterine fetal distress was highly suspected, and so <lb/>we decided to cease the pregnancy immediately. On that <lb/>day, the patient underwent caesarean section and was deliv-<lb/>ered of a female, well-being baby weighing 1470 g. The <lb/>Apgar score was 5, 8 and 9 at the 1st, 5th and 10th minutes <lb/>respectively. The placenta was pathologically examined <lb/>(Fig. 2), and the result revealed placental dysfunction, single <lb/>umbilical artery and vascular pathological change caused by <lb/>hypertension. <lb/>On 8th February 2012, the patient felt chest tight-<lb/>ness and coughed up foamy sputum. In case of heart <lb/>failure, ECG was performed and blood tests were ex-<lb/>amined: BUN 13.15 mmol/L, Cr376 μg/L, K 6.6 mmol/ <lb/>L, Na 134 mmol/L, Cl 110 mmol/L, Ca 2.14 mmol/L, <lb/>CK 158 U/L, CK-MB 3.3 μg/L, cTnI 0.051 μg/L, NT-<lb/>proBNP 122 pg/ml. Although the ECG and myocardial <lb/>enzymes did not indicate any abnormity, the transient <lb/>hyperkalemia could be malicious and fatal to postpartum <lb/>women with CRF. Therefore HD was imminently per-<lb/>formed to alleviate the hyperkalemia. And fortunately, the <lb/>situation was controlled in time. <lb/>Outcomes and 3-year follow-up <lb/>During the following days, the mother was in a stable <lb/>condition, and there was no evidence of neonatal <lb/>pathology. Therefore, they were discharged from the <lb/>hospital on the 8th post-delivery day. The patient still <lb/>suffered from anuria, and regularly revisited our hospital <lb/>for HD three times a week. <lb/>Recently the mother and child returned to our hospital. <lb/>The mother&apos;s condition had been stabilized by regular <lb/>hemolysis, and the child had been growing up healthily. <lb/>Literature review and discussion <lb/>Uremia-associated hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction and <lb/>malnutrition usually result in amenorrhea and anovulation, <lb/>and thus disturbances in menstruation and fertility are <lb/>commonly encountered in women with CRF, leading to a <lb/>low pregnancy rate in these patients [1, 5]. HD is per-<lb/>formed on CRF patients, especially those suffered from <lb/>anuria, to alleviate the uremic condition. However, dis-<lb/>turbance of body homeostasis is a common complication <lb/>of HD [1, 4, 5]. Long-term nausea and vomiting caused by <lb/></body>

			<body>acid-base and electrolytes imbalance may cover the early <lb/>pregnancy reactions in HD patients, delay the treatment, <lb/>and lower the successful rate of HD parturition. Since <lb/>1971 Confortini et al. [2] reported the first successful case <lb/>of HD pregnancy, further cases followed. In 1980 the <lb/>European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EDTA) <lb/>reported a pregnancy incidence of 0.9 % [6], while recent <lb/>publications reported pregnancy in 1.0-7.0 % women on <lb/>chronic dialysis, and 30-50 % of those pregnancies <lb/>resulted in delivery of a surviving infant [7]. Although the <lb/>successful incidence tends to increase, it is still uncom-<lb/>mon, and with high maternal and fetal mortality and mor-<lb/>bidity rate [3, 4]. <lb/>In women of childbearing age on dialysis, menstrual <lb/>irregularity, amenorrhea, sexual dysfunction, nausea and <lb/>elevated beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin <lb/>(β-HCG) have been observed in some patients with renal <lb/>failure which may give a false-positive pregnant test [8, 9]. <lb/>Early diagnosis is advantageous for maternal fitness <lb/>and fetal viability, since it allows intensified dialysis <lb/>early in pregnancy and an early review of medications <lb/>contraindicated during pregnancy. In our case, the <lb/>patient became pregnant after 6 years of HD, and she <lb/>was not found pregnant until the 22nd GW. The late <lb/>diagnosis might have delayed the intensive antenatal <lb/>care and reduced the successful chance. However, the <lb/>adequate HD might largely contribute to the success-<lb/>ful maintenance of pregnancy and parturition in our <lb/>case [1, 4, 5]. <lb/>Polyhydramnios is a common complication in pregnant <lb/>women undergoing HD with an incidence ranging from <lb/>30-70 % [8-10]. It has been reported that intensified HD <lb/>could alleviate polyhydramnios by reducing fluid over-<lb/>burden and lowering osmotic pressure [7, 11]. In our case, <lb/>the patient received 5 HD sessions a week since the 22nd <lb/>GW. Her AFI was 19.5 at the 32nd GW, and started daily <lb/>HD. It seemed that the intensified HD didn&apos;t reduce the <lb/>amniotic fluidto a better level, as AFI increased to 22.9 at <lb/>the 34th +1 GW, yet the pregnant outcome and fetal viability <lb/>was impressive. This result is corresponding to the previous <lb/>finding that polyhydramnios was associated with a favorable <lb/>fetal outcome in pregnant women undergoing long-term <lb/>HD [12, 13]. <lb/>The pathophysiology of polyhydramnios has not yet <lb/>been clarified. An influence of the fetal osmotic diuresis, <lb/>caused by the increased concentration of urea and related <lb/>substances in maternal blood, has been proposed [12]. <lb/>Although intensified HD may ameliorate the exacerbation <lb/>of polyhydramnios, the influence of osmotic diuresis may <lb/>overwhelm. This may explain why the AFI failed to de-<lb/>crease despite of daily HD. Additionally, fetuses with uter-<lb/>oplacental insufficiency habitually shunt blood away from <lb/>Fig. 2 Placenta and its pathological examination. a Placenta by naked eyes.

			<body>nonessential organs, such as kidneys, to decrease urine <lb/>output and thus amniotic fluid volume, leading to oligohy-<lb/>dramnios [4]. The presence of polyhrydramnios may be <lb/>an indirect evidence of adequate placental function and <lb/>therefore be associated with better fetal prognosis. Further <lb/>studies are in need to discuss the relationship between the <lb/>presence of polyhydramnios and the &quot;doses&quot; of HD. <lb/>Hypertension is the most frequently reported maternal <lb/>complication in this population [14]. Due to combination <lb/>of hypertention and inefficient renal function, the incidence <lb/>of pre-eclampsia is alarmingly high, occurring in 50 % of <lb/>pregnant women with pre-existing renal diseases [15, 16]. <lb/>The presence of pre-eclampsia had a negative impact on <lb/>the successful delivery rate and accounted for 57 % of <lb/>perinatal deaths, and interventions lowering the incidence <lb/>or severity of pre-eclampsia may potentially improve fetal <lb/>outcome [4]. However, the fluctuant blood pressure, pro-<lb/>teinuria as well as BUN and Cr level make the diagnosis <lb/>of pre-eclampsia in patients undergoing HD exceedingly <lb/>difficult, delaying the early medical intervention and in-<lb/>creasing the maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. <lb/>In this case, the patient had taken amlodipine to control <lb/>blood pressure for 6 years. When being found pregnant, <lb/>she continued amlodipine therapy and started intensified <lb/>HD. In case of pre-eclampsia, blood pressure, blood rou-<lb/>tine test, coagulation, and heart function was frequently <lb/>measured, and Color Doppler ultrasound involving the <lb/>uterine arteries was performed at least once a week. This <lb/>patient&apos;s renal dysfunction and hypertion-before-pregnancy <lb/>awfully increased the risk of pre-eclampsia. Yet fortunately <lb/>there were neither clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia <lb/>such as severe headache, blurred vision, and palpitation, <lb/>nor obvious abnormality of the aforementioned tests. The <lb/>combination of antihypertensive medication and en-<lb/>hanced HD might facilitate the balance of body fluid <lb/>and stabilization of blood pressure, contributing to the <lb/>successful outcome. <lb/>Low dose of aspirin had been applied to prevent <lb/>pregnancy-induced hypertension safely [17, 18]. How-<lb/>ever, animal studies have shown the increased risk of <lb/>congenital anomalies caused by aspirin, and data from <lb/>human studies remains conflicting [19]. Moreover, the <lb/>possible preventive effect of aspirin aims at the early <lb/>pregnancy. The patient came to our hospital at the 32nd <lb/>GW, and with a considerable risk of premature delivery. <lb/>Therefore, aspirin was not applied to this patient. <lb/>Anemia occurs during pregnancy presumably due to the <lb/>hemodilution caused by greater vascular volume, EPO re-<lb/>sistance as a result of increased cytokine production during <lb/>pregnancy, and high demand of red blood cell production <lb/>for fetal growth [14]. Pregnant women undergoing HD are <lb/>more likely to have anemia, because of the exceeding loss <lb/>of iron and red blood cells from frequent HD. Previous <lb/>studies have shown an increased rate of preterm delivery in <lb/>women with anemia [20, 21]. The widely accepted indica-<lb/>tors of anemia, hemoglobin level and hematocrit, have <lb/>also been found positively related to the successful rate of <lb/>parturition and fetal birth weight [22]. Therefore, EPO are <lb/>regularly given to pregnant dialysis patients, with doses <lb/>requiring an increase of about 50 %. Also, frequent moni-<lb/>toring of hemoglobin level and hematocrit is required, <lb/>with a target value of 100-110 g/L and &gt;30 % respectively <lb/>[4, 23]. In our case, 0.4 mg folic acid and 150 mg of poly-<lb/>feroseeach day and 300 IU of erythropoietin twice a week <lb/>were given to the patient. Her hemoglobin level and <lb/>hematocrit were kept stable and near the target value. <lb/>Maternal dry weight and weight gain should be regularly <lb/>evaluated and adjustedaccording to the estimated weight <lb/>of the placenta and fetus as well as the increase in plasma <lb/>volume. In the first trimester, the mother should gain a <lb/>minimum of 1-1.5 kg per week. After this, weight <lb/>should increase by 0.45-1 kg per week [14]. There is <lb/>little information on the nutritional status of pregnant <lb/>dialysis patients, but 1 g/kg/day protein intake for the <lb/>mother plus 20 g/day for fetal development has been <lb/>suggested [6, 14, 23]. <lb/>In maintenance HD, carnitine is lost through dialytic <lb/>membranes, leading in selected patients to carnitine deple-<lb/>tion with a relative increase of the esterified forms [24]. <lb/>The concentration of plasma amino acids and glucose also <lb/>falls after HD, resulting a state of fasting and wasting [25]. <lb/>Thus the intravenous supplement of compound amino <lb/>acid, L-carnitine, and fructose diphosphate sodium were <lb/>given to improve the nutritional status of the patient after <lb/>each HD session. <lb/>Fetal anomalies, including spina bifida, encephalocele, <lb/>cystic hygroma, valvular incompetence, and kyphoscoliosis, <lb/>belong to the worst situations of pregnancy. The risk fac-<lb/>tors and/or indications of fetal anomalies include poly-and <lb/>oligohydramnios, single umbilical artery, maternal diseases <lb/>such as diabetes, hypertension and infections [26]. In our <lb/>case, the patient was diagnosed with polyhydramnios, single <lb/>umbilical artery, anemia, hypertension, and uremic stage of <lb/>CRF. Therefore the incidence of fetal anomaly is exceed-<lb/>ingly high. We carried on color Doppler ultrasound for the <lb/>patient once a week tomonitor the fetal condition, and for-<lb/>tunately this was a well-being fetus. <lb/>Maternal mortality is relatively low and less reported <lb/>[1, 4]. Cesarean section delivery is common among <lb/>women on dialysis and is most often prompted by pre-<lb/>mature rupture of membranes. Infants born to women <lb/>on HD are usually premature, with multiple causes, such <lb/>as polyhydramnios, maternal hypertension, premature <lb/>rupture of the membranes and et al. In our case, the <lb/>patient underwent progressive uterine contraction at the <lb/>34th GW, and intrauterine fetal distress was indicated by <lb/>NST. Thus we ceased the pregnancy by caesarean section <lb/>and delivered a female, well-being baby of which the <lb/></body>

			<body>weight was 1470 g. The patient recovered satisfactorily <lb/>and returned to HD regimen of 3 sessions a week with <lb/>good tolerance. Currently, the baby hasn&apos;t yet had any ob-<lb/>vious pathological change. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>The pregnancy of women on chronic dialysis is at very <lb/>high risk but it should reach a good outcome with multi-<lb/>disciplinary management, by nephrologists, obstetricians, <lb/>neonatologists, nutritionists and other departments. We <lb/>advise that all aspects of HD, including duration, ad-<lb/>equacy, nutrition, anemia, and blood pressure control <lb/>should be closely followed throughout the course of preg-<lb/>nancy. Finally, since pregnancy can occur in women on <lb/>dialysis, health care providers should discuss fertility and <lb/>contraception with their premenopausal dialysis patients. <lb/></body>
