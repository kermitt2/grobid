CALGB 80802 (Alliance) randomized phase III trial <lb/>of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular <lb/>carcinoma (HCC), showed no improvement in median overall survival (OS). Whether HCV viral <lb/>load impacts therapy and if any correlation between HCV titers and outcome based on HCV was <lb/>studied. In HCV patients, HCV titer levels were evaluated at baseline and at multiple post-<lb/>baseline time points until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. HCV titer levels were <lb/>evaluated in relation to OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Among 53 patients with baseline <lb/>HCV data, 12 patients had undetectable HCV (HCV-UN). Post-baseline HCV titer levels did not <lb/>significantly differ between treatment arms. One patient in each arm went from detectable to <lb/>HCV-UN with greater than 2 log-fold titer levels reduction. Aside from these two HCV-UN <lb/>patients, HCV titers remained stable on treatment. Patients who had HCV-UN at baseline were <lb/>3.5 times more likely to progress and/or die from HCC compared to HCV detectable (HR=3.51, <lb/>95% CI: 1.58 -7.78; p=0.002). HCV titer levels remained unchanged, negating any sorafenib <lb/>impact onto HCV titer levels. Although an overall negative phase III study, patients treated with <lb/>doxorubicin plus sorafenib and sorafenib only, on CALGB 80802 had worse PFS if HCV-UN. <lb/>Higher levels of HCV titers at baseline were associated with significantly improved PFS. <lb/></front>

    <body>Introduction <lb/>Sorafenib efficiently blocks nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A)-recruited c-Raf-mediated <lb/>hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and viral gene expression (1). Sorafenib a highly specific c-<lb/>Raf-inhibitor and mediated antiviral effects were demonstrated to negate HCV replication and <lb/>viral gene expression (2). In HCV-replicating cells, sorafenib also decreased the <lb/>hyperphosphorylated form of NS5A that led to the formation of added hypophosphorylated <lb/>forms. In comparison, inhibition of targets downstream of c-Raf or inhibition of other tyrosine <lb/>kinase inhibitors like sunitinib did not affect HCV replication. HCV infection of Huh-7 cells has <lb/>been shown to induce VEGF expression that depolarizes hepatocytes and disrupts tight junctions, <lb/>thereby making cells more susceptible to further HCV infection in an autocrine fashion (3). <lb/>Sorafenib treatment inhibited this cycle of events. These data highlight a potential role for VEGF <lb/>antagonists to treat HCV infection in addition to their intrinsic properties of regulating HCC <lb/>growth and development. <lb/>Release of Raf-1-Ask-1 dimer and inhibition of Raf-1 via sorafenib putatively differ in <lb/>the presence or absence of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by the <lb/>pro-apoptotic ASK-1 pathway. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) activity has been <lb/>associated with expression of Raf-1, which binds to and neutralizes ASK1, preventing the cell <lb/>from undergoing apoptosis. Inhibition of Raf-1 by sorafenib would be expected to restore <lb/>chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (4). Potential effects of Raf onto the sensitivity of cells to <lb/>doxorubicin and in regulation of the multi-drug-resistance-1 (mdr-1) gene led to the <lb/>consideration of overcoming doxorubicin resistance by combining it with anti-Raf (5,6). This led <lb/>to a phase I study evaluating the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib four patients with HCC <lb/>achieved prolonged stability of disease, and continued therapy for more than 1 year. Despite a <lb/></body>

    <body>21% area under the curve (AUC) increase of doxorubicin when administered concomitantly with <lb/>sorafenib, no substantial worsening of toxicity over what would be expected from either <lb/>compound administered individually (7). Collectively the above led to a positive randomized <lb/>phase II clinical trial of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus doxorubicin (8). The finding of greater <lb/>median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival with sorafenib plus <lb/>doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy led to Cancer and Leukemia Group B <lb/>(CALGB) 80802, a randomized phase III trial that evaluated doxorubicin and sorafenib <lb/>combination versus (vs) sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9). <lb/>CALGB is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance). Additionally, an <lb/>analysis of prognostic factors of another two randomized phase III studies of sorafenib alone <lb/>suggested better survival in patients with HCV albeit no correlative analyses were performed <lb/>(10). Patients were accrued from 2010 --2015, which predated the availability of anti-HCV <lb/>therapies. <lb/>Despite the pretrial hypothesis of a favorable drug-drug interaction, CALGB 80802 did <lb/>not show an improvement in median overall survival (OS) with the addition of doxorubicin to <lb/>sorafenib compared to sorafenib alone. Median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.3-10.8 months) in <lb/>the doxorubicin plus sorafenib arm and 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.3-12.9 months) in the sorafenib <lb/>alone arm (hazard ratio (HR), 1.05; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). Anticipating the importance of HCV in <lb/>the outcome of advanced HCC patients, preplanned study objectives included an analysis of the <lb/>possible antiviral effect of therapy on HCV, perhaps above and beyond effects on the cancer <lb/>itself. The main objective of the correlative study reported herein was to evaluate HCV titers <lb/>and change with treatment and to examine the correlation with patient outcome. <lb/></body>

    <body>Materials and methods <lb/>Study investigators obtained written informed consent from all subjects. The studies were <lb/>conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and they were approved by the <lb/>institutional review board at all sites and/or the National Cancer Institute (NCI) central IRB <lb/>(NCIRB) and was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01015833). This unblinded randomized <lb/>phase III clinical trial was led by Alliance in collaboration with Canadian Cancer Trials Group, <lb/>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network, and <lb/>Southwest Oncology Group. It was launched in February 2010 and completed in May 2015; data <lb/>were also analyzed during this time frame. Patients with histologically proven advanced HCC, <lb/>no prior systemic therapy, Child-Pugh grade A score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group <lb/>performance status of 0 to 2 (later amended to 0-1), and adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, <lb/>and cardiac function were eligible. The OS primary end point had a final analysis planned with <lb/>364 events observed among 480 total patients with 90% power to detect a 37% increase in <lb/>median OS. <lb/>To determine the endpoint of HCV on outcomes with sorafenib treatment in each arm, <lb/>preplanned study objectives were used to determine the proportion of patients with undetectable <lb/>viral load (&lt;50 copies/mL), and to assess and compare the HCV antiviral effect of sorafenib or <lb/>sorafenib plus doxorubicin. That was performed by comparing patients&apos; rate of undetectable viral <lb/>load or 2-log decline in viral load, and association with overall survival (OS), progression-free <lb/>survival (PFS), and response rate for the whole study population, and on each treatment arm. The <lb/>rate of virologic failure, defined as reversing from undetectable (&lt;50 copies per mL) to <lb/>detectable viral load, or increase in 2 logs above nadir, at any point in time was also to be <lb/>assessed. <lb/></body>

    <body>Peripheral venous blood was collected at baseline and on-treatment from patients who <lb/>provided written informed consent. Samples were processed on-site within 2 hours; serum was <lb/>aliquoted, frozen, and shipped on dry ice to the Alliance Pathology Coordinating Office for <lb/>centralized storage. Aliquots of frozen serum were shipped to the Memorial Sloan Kettering lab <lb/>for all HCV analyses. HCV RNA levels were measured by the Roche cobas AmpliPrep/cobas <lb/>TaqMan HCV Test as previously described (11). Specimens were evaluated by PCR and <lb/>genotyped at baseline on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and HCV titer levels were evaluated on Day 1 of <lb/>Cycles 2, 3, and 4 as well as at time of disease progression and end of active treatment. <lb/>Detectable HCV titers were defined as HCV RNA ≥50 copies/ml. Quasispecies changes for <lb/>resistant mutations were investigated for patients who exhibited &quot;virologic failure&quot; (a reversal <lb/>from undetectable &lt;50 copies/ml to detectable ≥50 copies/ml viral load or an increase of 2 logs <lb/>above nadir) during the study. Samples were stored and analyzed at the end of the follow-up <lb/>period. Laboratory investigators were blinded to patient identity and outcomes. Influence of the <lb/>HCV titer levels was evaluated in relation to the study objectives OS and PFS. <lb/>Biostatistics <lb/>The prevalence of HCV with or without presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was <lb/>evaluated across all patients. Those with HCV at baseline who had stored serum had HCV RNA <lb/>and titer levels assessed. Summary statistics were calculated across all patients with HCV at <lb/>baseline. We further summarized and compared participants who had serum versus those who <lb/>did not have serum available for these analyses. <lb/>The number of copies/mL within each treatment group and across all patients was <lb/>summarized at each time point.

Viral loads were evaluated <lb/>as a continuous measure as well as categorized as undetectable versus detectable (&lt;50 copies/ml; <lb/>≥50 copies/ml). A subset of patients did not have titer data available at baseline; given the <lb/>observed consistency of titer levels over time, we also evaluated the influence of HCV from the <lb/>first sample, where we imputed missing baseline measures using cycle 2 day 1 measures. <lb/>Analyses were conducted using only those with baseline samples and using all patients with <lb/>baseline values imputed. <lb/>The influence of HCV titer levels was evaluated in relation to PFS and OS. PFS was <lb/>defined as the time from randomization to the progression and/or death due to any cause, where <lb/>patients who were progression-free at their last evaluation were censored at that time. OS was <lb/>defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, where patients alive at last <lb/>follow-up were censored at that time. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to evaluate differences <lb/>among those with detectable versus HCV undetectable titer levels. Cox proportional hazards <lb/>models were used to evaluate the influence of continuous HCV titers and detectable versus <lb/>undetectable HCV status in relation to PFS and OS, stratifying by treatment arm and by <lb/>exploring potential effect modification of treatment arm (sorafenib with versus without <lb/>doxorubicin). <lb/>Data collection and statistical analyses were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and <lb/>Data Management Center. Data quality was ensured by review of data by the Alliance Statistics <lb/>and Data Management Center and by the study chairperson following Alliance policies.

    <body>Results <lb/>Of 356 patients enrolled on CALGB 80802, 83 patients were HCV-positive at baseline. <lb/>Of note, the HCV infection rate was significantly higher in Black/African American patients <lb/>(25/50=50%) compared to White patients (54/239=23%) or other race groups (4/67=6%) <lb/>(p&lt;0.0001) (Table 1). <lb/>Among the 83 HCV-positive patients at baseline, serum and thus HCV titer data were <lb/>available on 53 patients. Per arm data is featured in Supp. Figure 1). Among these 83 HCV-<lb/>positive patients, the only baseline clinical factor that was significantly different was that those <lb/>in whom serum was available tended to have a higher percentage of ECOG PS &gt;0 relative those <lb/>who did not have serum available. (68.6% vs. 41.3%, respectively; p=0.042). <lb/>Of the 53 patients with HCV titer data, 12 patients (doxorubicin + sorafenib: 5, and <lb/>sorafenib: 7) had undetectable HCV titer at their first measurement. The HCV titer levels did not <lb/>significantly differ between treatment arms and the values remained very consistent over time <lb/>(Supp. Figure 2).

    <body>Viral load over time per treatment arm is illustrated in Figure 1A for doxorubicin plus <lb/>sorafenib (A), and in Figure 1B for Sorafenib alone. In view of the consistency of the titer levels, <lb/>we imputed the cycle 2 day 1 HCV titer status (detectable vs not) for patients who were missing <lb/>baseline samples, albeit this presumption could not be validated. For the two patients who had a <lb/>significant drop in HCV titer levels, this occurred by the cycle 3 day 1 time point. Among the 12 <lb/>patients who had undetectable HCV at their first sample, 8 had measurements taken from pre-<lb/>treatment cycle 1 day 1 baseline sample and 4 were from a cycle 2 day 1 sample. <lb/>Patient Outcomes <lb/>The study was halted after accrual of 356 patients with a futility boundary crossed at a <lb/>planned interim analysis. In the overall trial, median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.3-10.8 <lb/>months) in the doxorubicin plus sorafenib arm and 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.3-12.9 months) in the <lb/>sorafenib alone arm (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The median PFS was 4.0 months <lb/>(95% CI, 3.4-4.9 months) in the doxorubicin plus sorafenib arm and 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9-4.5 <lb/>months) in the sorafenib alone arm (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.16). <lb/>In this subset of 53 HCV-positive patients with HCV titer data available, the median <lb/>follow-up was 36.1 months (95% CI: 34.7 to NR) and 50 patients had a PFS event (progression <lb/>and/or death) and 47 patients died. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients across <lb/>both treatment arms was 5.5 months vs 2.8 months for HCV-detectable vs undetectable viral <lb/>load, respectively (Figure 2). <lb/>PFS was significantly worse in those with undetectable HCV titer levels at their first sample <lb/>timepoint compared to those with detectable HCV (HR=3.51, 95% CI: 1.58 -7.78; p=0.002). <lb/>This result held even when the analysis was restricted only to those individuals with baseline <lb/></body>

    <body>samples (HR=3.47, 95% CI: 1.47 -8.17; p=0.004; Table 2). Differences in PFS and OS between <lb/>HCV-detectable and HCV-UN viral load both at baseline and post-baseline are delineated in <lb/>Table 2. These differences did not translate into significant differences in OS (HR=1.14, 95% CI: <lb/>0.58 -2.23; p=0.70; Figure 3). These results were consistent even when looking at results by <lb/>treatment arm (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). <lb/>Genotype <lb/>In addition to the HCV titer data, we also assessed the corresponding genotype data for these <lb/>patients. Of the 53 patients with measurable samples, 12 were classified as &apos;undetected&apos; for the <lb/>genotype. Of the remaining 41 patients, the majority (n=23) were 1a, with 8 patients as 1b and <lb/>two additional patients as 1 who were not able to be further differentiated as 1a vs. 1b. The <lb/>remaining 7 patients were classified as 2 (n=3) and 3 (n=4). When looking at PFS in relation to <lb/>genotype, we found that there were no significant differences based on genotypes; however, <lb/>those classified as &apos;undetected&apos; for genotype had significantly worse prognosis compared to all <lb/>others (HR=3.41, 95% CI: 1.66 -6.99; p=0.0008). (Table 3) <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This multigroup study of the addition of doxorubicin to sorafenib therapy did not show <lb/>improvement of OS or PFS in patients with HCC.

    <body>can have very different outcomes (e.g., the SHARP North American/European and the Asia-<lb/>Pacific sorafenib phase III trials) (9). <lb/>Contrary to the preclinical hypothesis that sorafenib could efficiently block HCV <lb/>replication and viral gene expression (2), we observed that sorafenib did not influence HCV titer <lb/>levels in patients with HCC in this study. Only two patients showed conversion from detectable <lb/>to undetectable HCV titer, one on each treatment arm. Patients treated with sorafenib, <lb/>independent of the addition of doxorubicin, and who had HCV-UN had a poorer PFS compared <lb/>to patients with higher titers of HCV titers at baseline; there was no difference in survival <lb/>outcomes based on HCV genotype in patients with HCV infection. Our results are like the <lb/>collaborative effort of two prior phase III clinical trials of sorafenib in Chinese patients with <lb/>advanced HCC (12). It is important to note though that patients with HCV-UN had more T4 <lb/>tumors thus more metastatic disease. Even if not statistically significant this may have influenced <lb/>the suggested worse PFS. In all three studies, patients with HCV had better OS compared to <lb/>patients with HBV infection (9,10). The data presented herein, however, suggest that these <lb/>outcomes are independent of any coincidental anti-HCC viral effect of the anticancer treatment. <lb/>Losses and gains of chromosome regions may differ in HCC caused by HBV as <lb/>compared to HCV infection, which may partly explain the findings presented herein (10-13). The <lb/>therapeutic field has evolved with the advent of checkpoint blockade as an effective treatment for <lb/>HCC. The etiology of HCC is tightly connected to the activation of immune cells, in that CD8 + T <lb/>cells help induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-HCC, rather than the anticipated immune <lb/>surveillance (14). The impact of the tumor immune microenvironment extends beyond exhausted <lb/>CD8+ T cells. An elevation in Ki67+ subset of CD8+ T cells leads to further improvement in <lb/></body>

    <body>outcome, independent of etiology, that is still more enhanced with the addition of anti-CTLA4 <lb/>therapy (15). <lb/>Limitations of this correlative study include the potential invalidity of the hypothesis <lb/>since novel data suggest a considerably more complex tumor immune microenvironment than <lb/>originally thought, as solely impacted by the viral status etiology and extent (16, 17). In chronic <lb/>HCV patients, severe CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell dysfunctions have been reported. This suggests <lb/>that HCV could employ certain mechanisms to counteract or suppress the host T-cell responses <lb/>(18). An understanding of such implied molecular mechanisms has already started. Novel <lb/>molecules that are carcinogenic to hepatitis viruses and activate the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway <lb/>have been identified (19). These include five hub genes, POLR2A, POLR2B, RPL5, RPS6, and <lb/>RPL23A, add to M2-type macrophages. These would be expected to serve as molecular markers <lb/>and targets for diagnosis and treatment of HCC. <lb/>The small number of patients with HCV included and the small number of patient <lb/>samples analyzed is also noted. When CALGB 80802 was initiated, tissue and biospecimen <lb/>acquisition was optional out of concern that mandatory eligibility criteria might inhibit patient <lb/>enrolment. Even though biospecimens were banked in only a subset of these patients, the <lb/>correlative results provide meaningful data despite the disappointing clinical results. <lb/>Future investigation is needed on the outcomes of therapies based on the underlying <lb/>etiology of HCC, particularly given the notable emergence of new therapies for HCC over the <lb/>last half decade (20-21). <lb/>To conclude, despite a strong preclinical rationale, we observed no difference in outcome <lb/>for HCC patients treated with sorafenib and observed an unexplained improvement in PFS in a <lb/>small patient subset. <lb/></body>
