			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Charged-particle measurements in proton-proton (pp) colli-<lb/>sions provide insight into the strong interaction in the low-energy, <lb/>non-perturbative region of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Par-<lb/>ticle interactions at these energy scales are typically described <lb/>by QCD-inspired models implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) event <lb/>generators with free parameters that can be constrained by such <lb/>measurements. An accurate description of low-energy strong inter-<lb/>action processes is essential for simulating single pp interactions <lb/>as well as the effects of multiple pp interactions at high instan-<lb/>taneous luminosity in hadron colliders. Charged-particle distribu-<lb/>tions have been measured previously in pp and proton-antiproton <lb/>collisions at various centre-of-mass energies [1-7] (and references <lb/>therein). <lb/>This paper presents inclusive measurements of primary charged-<lb/>particle distributions in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV, using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment [8] <lb/>at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) corresponding to an integrated <lb/>luminosity of approximately 170 μb −1 . Here inclusive means that <lb/>all processes in pp interactions are included and no attempt to <lb/>correct for certain types of process, such as diffraction, is made. <lb/>These measurements, together with previous results, shed light <lb/>on the evolution of charged-particle multiplicities with centre-of-<lb/></body>

			<body>mass energy, which is poorly constrained. A strategy similar to <lb/>that in Ref. [1] is used, where more details of the analysis tech-<lb/>niques are given. The distributions are measured using tracks from <lb/>primary charged particles, corrected for detector effects, and are <lb/>presented as inclusive distributions in a well-defined kinematic re-<lb/>gion. Primary charged particles are defined as charged particles <lb/>with a mean lifetime τ &gt; 300 ps, either directly produced in pp <lb/>interactions or from subsequent decays of directly produced par-<lb/>ticles with τ &lt; 30 ps; particles produced from decays of particles <lb/>with τ &gt; 30 ps, called secondary particles, are excluded. This def-<lb/>inition differs from earlier analyses in that charged particles with <lb/>a mean lifetime 30 &lt; τ &lt; 300 ps were previously included. These <lb/>are charged strange baryons and have been removed due to the <lb/>low efficiency of reconstructing them. 1 All primary charged parti-<lb/>cles are required to have a momentum component transverse to <lb/>the beam direction, 2 p T , of at least 500 MeV and absolute pseudo-<lb/>rapidity, |η|, less than 2.5. Each event is required to have at least <lb/>one primary charged particle. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 Since strange baryons tend to decay within the detector volume, especially if <lb/>they have low momentum, they often do not leave enough hits to reconstruct a <lb/>track, leading to a track reconstruction efficiency of approximately 0.3%. <lb/></note>

Cylindrical coordinates (r, φ) are used in the transverse plane, φ being the <lb/>azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of <lb/>the polar angle θ as η = − ln tan(θ/2). <lb/></note>

			<body>In these events the following distributions are measured: <lb/>1 <lb/>N ev <lb/>• <lb/>dN ch <lb/>dη <lb/>, <lb/>1 <lb/>N ev <lb/>• <lb/>1 <lb/>2π p T <lb/>• <lb/>d 2 N ch <lb/>dηdp T <lb/>, and <lb/>1 <lb/>N ev <lb/>• <lb/>dN ev <lb/>dn ch <lb/>as well as the mean p T ( p T ) of all primary charged particles ver-<lb/>sus n ch . Here n ch is the number of primary charged particles in an <lb/>event, N ev is the number of events with n ch ≥ 1, and N ch is the to-<lb/>tal number of primary charged particles in the data sample. 3 The <lb/>measurements are also presented in a phase space that is common <lb/>to the ATLAS, CMS [9] and ALICE [10] detectors in order to ease <lb/>comparison between experiments. For this purpose an additional <lb/>requirement of |η| &lt; 0.8 is made for all primary charged particles. <lb/>These results are presented in Appendix A. Finally, the mean num-<lb/>ber of primary charged particles for η = 0 is compared to previous <lb/>measurements at different centre-of-mass energies. The measure-<lb/>ments are compared to particle-level MC predictions. <lb/>The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. The relevant <lb/>components of the ATLAS detector are described in Section 2. The <lb/>MC event generators and detector simulation used in the analysis <lb/>are introduced in Section 3. The selection criteria applied to the <lb/>data and the contributions from background events are discussed <lb/>in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. The selection efficiency and corre-<lb/>sponding corrections to the data are discussed in Sections 6 and 7 <lb/>respectively. The corrected results are compared to theoretical pre-<lb/>dictions in Section 8 and a conclusion is given in Section 9. The <lb/>measurement of primary charged particles in the reduced phase <lb/>space of |η| &lt; 0.8 is presented in Appendix A. <lb/>2. ATLAS detector <lb/>The ATLAS detector covers almost the whole solid angle around <lb/>the collision point with layers of tracking detectors, calorimeters <lb/>and muon chambers. For the measurements presented in this pa-<lb/>per, the tracking devices and the trigger system are of particular <lb/>importance. <lb/>The inner detector (ID) has full coverage in φ and covers the <lb/>pseudorapidity range |η| &lt; 2.5. It consists of a silicon pixel de-<lb/>tector (pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and a transition <lb/>radiation straw-tube tracker (TRT). These detectors span a sen-<lb/>sitive radial distance from the interaction point of 33-150 mm, <lb/>299-560 mm and 563-1066 mm respectively, and are situated in-<lb/>side a solenoid that provides a 2 T axial magnetic field. The barrel <lb/>(each end-cap) consists of four (three) pixel layers, four (nine) <lb/>double-layers of single-sided silicon microstrips with a 40 mrad <lb/>stereo angle between the inner and outer part of a double-layer, <lb/>and 73 (160) layers of TRT straws. The innermost pixel layer, the <lb/>insertable B-layer (IBL) [11], was added between Run 1 and Run 2 <lb/>of the LHC, around a new narrower (radius of 25 mm) and thin-<lb/>ner beam pipe. It is composed of 14 lightweight staves arranged <lb/>in a cylindrical geometry, each made of 12 silicon planar sen-<lb/>sors in its central region and 2 × 4 3D sensors at the ends. The <lb/>IBL pixel dimensions are 50 × 250 μm 2 in the φ and z directions <lb/>(compared with 50 × 400 μm 2 for other pixel layers). The smaller <lb/>radius and the reduced pixel size result in improvements of both <lb/>the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolutions. In <lb/>addition, new services have been implemented which significantly <lb/>reduce the material at the boundaries of the active tracking vol-<lb/>ume. A track from a charged particle traversing the barrel detector <lb/>typically has 12 silicon measurement points (hits), of which four <lb/>are pixel and eight SCT, and more than 30 TRT straw hits. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 The factor 2π p T in the p T spectrum comes from the Lorentz-invariant definition <lb/>of the cross section in terms of d 3 p. The results could thus be interpreted as the <lb/>massless approximation to d 3 p. <lb/></note>

			<body>The ATLAS detector employs a two-level trigger system: the <lb/>level-1 hardware stage (L1) and the high-level trigger software <lb/>stage (HLT). This measurement uses the L1 decision from the <lb/>minimum-bias trigger scintillators (MBTS), which were replaced <lb/>between Run 1 and Run 2. The MBTS are mounted at each end <lb/>of the detector in front of the liquid-argon end-cap calorimeter <lb/>cryostats at z = ±3.56 m and segmented into two rings in pseudo-<lb/>rapidity (2.07 &lt; |η| &lt; 2.76 and 2.76 &lt; |η| &lt; 3.86). The inner ring is <lb/>segmented into eight azimuthal sectors while the outer ring is seg-<lb/>mented into four azimuthal sectors, giving a total of twelve sectors <lb/>per side. The MBTS trigger selection used for this paper requires <lb/>one counter above threshold from either side of the detector and <lb/>is referred to as a single-arm trigger. The efficiency of this trigger <lb/>is studied with an independent control trigger. The control trigger <lb/>selects events randomly at L1 which are then filtered at HLT by <lb/>requiring at least one reconstructed track with p T &gt; 200 MeV. <lb/>3. Monte Carlo event generator simulation <lb/>The pythia 8 [12], epos [13] and qgsjet-ii [14] MC generators <lb/>are used to correct the data for detector effects and to compare <lb/>with particle-level corrected data. A brief introduction to the rele-<lb/>vant parts of these event generators is given below. <lb/>In pythia 8 inclusive hadron-hadron interactions are described <lb/>by a model that splits the total inelastic cross section into non-<lb/>diffractive (ND) processes, dominated by t-channel gluon exchange, <lb/>and diffractive processes involving a colour-singlet exchange. The <lb/>simulation of ND processes includes multiple parton-parton in-<lb/>teractions (MPI). The diffractive processes are further divided into <lb/>single-diffractive dissociation (SD), where one of the initial protons <lb/>remains intact and the other is diffractively excited and dissociates, <lb/>and double-diffractive dissociation (DD) where both protons dis-<lb/>sociate. The sample contains approximately 22% SD and 12% DD <lb/>processes. Such events tend to have large gaps in particle pro-<lb/>duction at central rapidity. A pomeron-based approach is used to <lb/>describe these events [15]. <lb/>epos provides an implementation of a parton-based Gribov-<lb/>Regge [16] theory, which is an effective QCD-inspired field theory <lb/>describing hard and soft scattering simultaneously. <lb/>qgsjet-ii provides a phenomenological treatment of hadronic <lb/>and nuclear interactions in the Reggeon field theory frame-<lb/>work [17]. The soft and semi-hard parton processes are included <lb/>in the model within the &quot;semi-hard pomeron&quot; approach. epos and <lb/>qgsjet-ii calculations do not rely on the standard parton distribu-<lb/>tion functions (PDFs) as used in generators such as pythia 8. <lb/>Different settings of model parameters optimised to reproduce <lb/>existing experimental data are used in the simulation. These set-<lb/>tings are referred to as tunes. For pythia 8 two tunes are used, <lb/>a2 [18] and monash [19]; for epos the lhc [20] tune is used. <lb/>qgsjet-ii uses the default tune from the generator. Each tune <lb/>utilises 7 TeV minimum-bias data and is summarised in Table 1, <lb/>together with the version of each generator used to produce the <lb/>samples. The pythia 8 a2 sample, combined with a single-particle <lb/>MC simulation used to populate the high-p T region, is used to <lb/>derive the detector corrections for these measurements. All the <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Summary of MC tunes used to compare to the corrected data.

			<body>events are processed through the ATLAS detector simulation pro-<lb/>gram [23], which is based on geant4 [24]. They are then recon-<lb/>structed and analysed by the same program chain used for the <lb/>data. <lb/>4. Data selection <lb/>The data were recorded during a period with a special con-<lb/>figuration of the LHC with low beam currents and reduced beam <lb/>focusing, and thus giving a low expected mean number of interac-<lb/>tions per bunch crossing, μ = 0.005. Events were selected from <lb/>colliding proton bunches using a trigger which required one or <lb/>more MBTS counters above threshold on either side of the detec-<lb/>tor. <lb/>Each event is required to contain a primary vertex, recon-<lb/>structed from at least two tracks with a minimum p T of 100 MeV, <lb/>as described in Ref. [25]. To reduce contamination from events <lb/>with more than one interaction in a bunch crossing, events with a <lb/>second vertex containing four or more tracks are removed. Events <lb/>where the second vertex has fewer than four tracks are not re-<lb/>moved. These are dominated by contributions where a secondary <lb/>interaction is reconstructed as another primary vertex or where <lb/>the primary vertex is split into two vertices, one with few tracks. <lb/>The fraction of events rejected by the veto on additional vertices <lb/>due to split vertices or secondary interactions is estimated in the <lb/>simulation to be 0.02%, which is negligible and therefore ignored. <lb/>Track candidates are reconstructed [26,27] in the silicon detec-<lb/>tors and then extrapolated to include measurements in the TRT. <lb/>Events are required to contain at least one selected track, pass-<lb/>ing the following criteria: p T &gt; 500 MeV and |η| &lt; 2.5; at least <lb/>one pixel hit and at least six SCT hits, with the additional require-<lb/>ment of an innermost-pixel-layer hit if expected 4 (if a hit in the <lb/>innermost layer is not expected, the next-to-innermost hit is re-<lb/>quired if expected); |d BL <lb/>0 | &lt; 1.5 mm, where the transverse impact <lb/>parameter, d BL <lb/>0 , is calculated with respect to the measured beam <lb/>line position; and |z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ| &lt; 1.5 mm, where z BL <lb/>0 is the difference <lb/>between the longitudinal position of the track along the beam line <lb/>at the point where d BL <lb/>0 is measured and the longitudinal position <lb/>of the primary vertex, and θ is the polar angle of the track. Finally, <lb/>in order to remove tracks with mismeasured p T due to interactions <lb/>with the material or other effects, the track-fit χ 2 probability is re-<lb/>quired to be greater than 0.01 for tracks with p T &gt; 10 GeV. There <lb/>are 8.87 million events selected, containing a total of 106 million <lb/>selected tracks. <lb/>The performance of the ID track reconstruction in the 13 TeV <lb/>data and its simulation is studied in Ref. [28]. Overall, good agree-<lb/>ment between data and simulation is observed. Fig. 1 shows <lb/>selected performance plots particularly relevant to this analysis. <lb/>Fig. 1(a) shows the average number of silicon hits as a function <lb/>of η. There is reasonably good agreement, although discrepancies <lb/>of up to 2% (in the end-caps) are seen; however, these have a small <lb/>effect on the track reconstruction efficiency. The discrepancies are <lb/>due to differences between data and simulation in the number of <lb/>operational detector elements and an imperfect description of the <lb/>amount of detector material between the pixel detector and the <lb/>SCT. The impact on the results of these discrepancies is discussed <lb/>in Section 6.3. Fig. 1(b) shows the fraction of tracks with a given <lb/>number of IBL hits per track. There is a difference of 0.5% between <lb/>data and simulation in the fraction of tracks with zero IBL hits, <lb/>coming predominantly from a difference in the rate of tracks from <lb/>secondary particles, which is discussed in more detail in Section 5. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 A hit is expected if the extrapolated track crosses an active region of a pixel <lb/>module that has not been disabled. <lb/></note>

			<body>A systematic uncertainty due to the small remaining difference in <lb/>the efficiency of the requirement of at least one IBL hit is dis-<lb/>cussed in Section 6. Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) show the d BL <lb/>0 and z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ <lb/>distributions respectively. In these figures the fraction of tracks <lb/>from secondary particles in simulation is scaled to match the frac-<lb/>tion seen in data, and the separate contributions from tracks from <lb/>primary and secondary particles are shown. This, along with the <lb/>differences between simulation and data, which have a negligible <lb/>impact on the analysis, are discussed in Section 5. <lb/>5. Background contributions and non-primary tracks <lb/>The contribution from non-collision background events, such <lb/>as proton interactions with residual gas molecules in the beam <lb/>pipe, is estimated using events that pass the full event selection <lb/>but occur when only one of the two beams is present. After nor-<lb/>malising to the contribution expected in the selected data sample <lb/>(using the difference in the time of the MBTS hits on each side of <lb/>the detector, which is possible as background events with hits on <lb/>only one side are negligible) a contribution of less than 0.01% of <lb/>events is found from this source, which is negligible and therefore <lb/>neglected. Background events from cosmic rays, estimated by con-<lb/>sidering the expected rate of cosmic-ray events compared to the <lb/>event readout rate, are also found to be negligible and therefore <lb/>neglected. <lb/>The majority of events with more than one interaction in the <lb/>same bunch crossing are removed by the rejection of events with <lb/>more than one primary vertex. Some events may survive because <lb/>the interactions are very close in z and are merged together. The <lb/>probability to merge vertices is estimated by inspecting the dis-<lb/>tribution of the difference in the z position of pairs of vertices <lb/>( z). This distribution displays a deficit around <lb/>z = 0 due to <lb/>vertex merging. The magnitude of this effect is used to estimate <lb/>the probability of merging vertices, which is 3.2%. When this is <lb/>combined with the number of expected additional interactions for <lb/>μ = 0.005, the remaining contribution from tracks from addi-<lb/>tional interactions is found to be less than 0.01%, which is neg-<lb/>ligible and therefore neglected. The additional tracks in events in <lb/>which the second vertex has fewer than four associated tracks are <lb/>mostly rejected by the z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ requirement, and the remaining <lb/>contribution is also negligible and neglected. <lb/>The contribution from tracks originating from secondary parti-<lb/>cles is subtracted from the number of reconstructed tracks before <lb/>correcting for other detector effects. These particles are due to <lb/>hadronic interactions, photon conversions and decays of long-lived <lb/>particles. There is also a contribution of less than 0.1% from fake <lb/>tracks (those formed by a random combination of hits or from a <lb/>combination of hits from several particles); these are neglected. <lb/>The contribution of tracks from secondary particles is estimated <lb/>using simulation predictions for the shapes of the d BL <lb/>0 distribu-<lb/>tions for tracks from primary and secondary particles satisfying all <lb/>track selection criteria except the one on d BL <lb/>0 . These predictions <lb/>form templates that are fit to the data in order to extract the rel-<lb/>ative contribution of tracks from secondary particles. The Gaussian <lb/>core of the distribution is dominated by the tracks from primary <lb/>particles, with a width determined by their d BL <lb/>0 resolution; tracks <lb/>from secondary particles dominate the tails. The fit is performed <lb/>in the region 4 &lt; |d BL <lb/>0 | &lt; 9.5 mm, in order to reduce the depen-<lb/>dence on the description of the d BL <lb/>0 resolution, which affects the <lb/>core of the distribution. From the fit, it was determined that the <lb/>fraction of tracks from secondary particles in simulation needs to <lb/>be scaled by a factor 1.38 ± 0.14. This indicates that (2.3 ± 0.6)% of <lb/>tracks satisfying the final track selection criteria (|d BL <lb/>0 | &lt; 1.5 mm) <lb/>originate from secondary particles, where systematic uncertainties <lb/>are dominant and are discussed below. Of these tracks 6% come <lb/></body>

Comparison between data and pythia 8 a2 simulation for (a) the average number of silicon hits per track, before the requirement on the number of SCT hits is applied, <lb/>as a function of pseudorapidity, η; (b) the number of innermost-pixel-layer hits on a track before the requirement on the number of innermost-pixel-layer hits is applied; <lb/>(c) the transverse impact parameter distribution of the tracks, prior to any requirement on the transverse impact parameter, calculated with respect to the average beam <lb/>position, d BL <lb/>0 ; and (d) the difference between the longitudinal position of the track along the beam line at the point where d BL <lb/>0 is measured and the longitudinal position of <lb/>the primary vertex projected to the plane transverse to the track direction, z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ , prior to any requirement on z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ . The uncertainties are the statistical uncertainties <lb/>of the data. In (c) and (d) the separate contributions from tracks coming from primary and secondary particles are also shown and the fraction of secondary particles in the <lb/>simulation is scaled by 1.38 to match that seen in the data, with the final simulation distributions normalised to the number of tracks in the data. The inserts in the panels <lb/>for (c) and (d) show the distributions on a linear scale. <lb/>from photon conversions and the rest from hadronic interactions <lb/>or long-lived decays. The description of the η and p T dependence <lb/>of this contribution is modelled sufficiently accurately by the simu-<lb/>lation that no additional correction is required. Fig. 1(c) shows the <lb/>d BL <lb/>0 distribution for data compared to the simulation with the frac-<lb/>tion of tracks from secondary particles scaled to the fitted value. <lb/>A small disagreement is observed in the core of the d BL <lb/>0 distribu-<lb/>tion. This has no impact in the tail of the distribution used for <lb/>the fit. The dominant systematic uncertainty stems from the in-<lb/>terpolation of the number of tracks from secondary particles from <lb/>the fit region to the region |d BL <lb/>0 | &lt; 1.5 mm. Different generators <lb/>are used to estimate the interpolation and differences between <lb/>data and simulation in the shape of the d BL <lb/>0 distribution in the <lb/>fit region are considered. Additional, much smaller, systematic un-<lb/>certainties arise from a variation of the fit range, considering the <lb/>η dependence of the fitted fractions and from using special simu-<lb/>lation samples with varying amounts of detector material. <lb/>There is a second source of non-primary particles: charged par-<lb/>ticles with a mean lifetime 30 &lt; τ &lt; 300 ps which, unlike in previ-<lb/>ous analyses [1], are excluded from the primary-particle definition. <lb/>These are charged strange baryons that decay after a short flight <lb/>length and have a very low track reconstruction efficiency. Re-<lb/>constructed tracks from these particles are treated as background <lb/>and are subtracted. The fraction of reconstructed tracks coming <lb/>from strange baryons is estimated from simulation with epos to <lb/>be (0.01 ± 0.01)% on average, with the fraction increasing with <lb/>track p T to be (3 ± 1)% above 20 GeV. The fraction is much smaller <lb/>at low p T due to the extremely low efficiency of reconstructing <lb/>a track from a particle that decays early in the detector. The sys-<lb/>tematic uncertainty is taken as the maximum difference between <lb/>the nominal epos prediction and that of pythia 8 a2 or pythia 8 <lb/>monash, which is then symmetrised. <lb/>6. Selection efficiency <lb/>The data are corrected to obtain inclusive spectra for primary <lb/>charged particles satisfying the particle-level kinematic require-<lb/>ments. These corrections account for inefficiencies due to trigger <lb/>selection, vertex and track reconstruction. <lb/>In the following sections the methods used to obtain these ef-<lb/>ficiencies, as well as the systematic uncertainties associated with <lb/>them, are described. <lb/>6.1.

The trigger efficiency is there-<lb/>fore parameterised as a function of n no−z <lb/>sel , which is defined as the <lb/>number of tracks passing all of the track selection requirements <lb/>except for the z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ constraint, as this requires knowledge of <lb/>the primary vertex position. The trigger efficiency is taken to be <lb/>the fraction of events from the control trigger in which the MBTS <lb/>trigger also accepted the event. This is shown in Fig. 2(a) as a func-<lb/>tion of n no−z <lb/>sel . The efficiency is measured to be just below 99% for <lb/>n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1 and it rapidly rises to 100% at higher track multiplici-<lb/>ties. The trigger requirement is found to introduce no observable <lb/>bias in the p T and η distributions of selected tracks. Systematic un-<lb/>certainties are estimated from differences in the trigger efficiency <lb/>measured on each of the two sides of the detector and from a <lb/>study that assesses the impact of beam-induced background and <lb/>tracks from secondary particles by varying the impact parameter <lb/>requirements on selected tracks. The total systematic uncertainty is <lb/>±0.15% for n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1 and it rapidly decreases at higher track mul-<lb/>tiplicities. This uncertainty is negligible compared to those from <lb/>other sources and is therefore neglected. <lb/>6.2. Vertex reconstruction efficiency <lb/>The vertex reconstruction efficiency, ε vtx , is determined from <lb/>data by taking the ratio of the number of selected events with <lb/>a reconstructed vertex to the total number of events with the re-<lb/>quirement of a primary vertex removed. The expected contribution <lb/>from beam background events is estimated using the same method <lb/>as described in Section 5 and subtracted before measuring the effi-<lb/>ciency. Like the trigger efficiency, the vertex efficiency is measured <lb/>in bins of n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>as the z BL <lb/>0 • sin θ constraint cannot be applied to <lb/>the tracks in this study. The efficiency is measured to be just be-<lb/>low 90% for n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1 and it rapidly rises to 100% at higher track <lb/>multiplicities. In events with n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1 the efficiency is also mea-<lb/>sured as a function of η of the track, and the efficiency increases <lb/>monotonically from 81% at |η| = 2.5 to 93% at |η| = 0. The sys-<lb/>tematic uncertainty is estimated from the difference between the <lb/>vertex reconstruction efficiency measured prior to and after beam <lb/>background removal. The uncertainty is ±0.1% for n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1 and <lb/>rapidly decreases at higher track multiplicities. This uncertainty is <lb/>negligible compared to those from other sources and is therefore <lb/>neglected. <lb/>6.3. Track reconstruction efficiency <lb/>The primary track reconstruction efficiency, ε trk , is determined <lb/>from the simulation, corrected to account for differences between <lb/>data and simulation in the amount of detector material between <lb/>the pixel and SCT detectors in the region |η| &gt; 1.5. In the other <lb/>regions of the detector there is an uncertainty due to the knowl-<lb/>edge of the detector material that will be discussed below, but <lb/>no correction is applied. The efficiency is parameterised in two-<lb/>dimensional bins of p T and η and is defined as: <lb/>ε trk (p T , η) = <lb/>N matched <lb/>rec <lb/>(p T , η) <lb/>N gen (p T , η) <lb/>, <lb/>where p T and η are generated particle properties, N matched <lb/>rec <lb/>(p T , η) <lb/>is the number of reconstructed tracks matched to a generated pri-<lb/>mary charged particle and N gen (p T , η) is the number of generated <lb/>primary charged particles in that bin. A track is matched to a gen-<lb/>erated particle if the weighted fraction of hits on the track which <lb/>originate from that particle exceeds 50%. The hits are weighted <lb/>such that all subdetectors have the same weight in the sum. <lb/>The track reconstruction efficiency depends on the amount of <lb/>material in the detector, due to particle interactions that lead to <lb/>efficiency losses. The relatively large amount of material between <lb/>the pixel and SCT detectors in the region |η| &gt; 1.5 has changed <lb/>between Run 1 and Run 2 due to the replacement of some pixel <lb/>services, which are difficult to simulate accurately. The track re-<lb/>construction efficiency in this region is corrected using a method <lb/></body>

			<body>that compares the efficiency to extend a track reconstructed in the <lb/>pixel detector into the SCT in data and simulation. Differences in <lb/>this extension efficiency are sensitive to differences in the amount <lb/>of material in this region. The correction together with the sys-<lb/>tematic uncertainty, coming predominantly from the uncertainty <lb/>of the particle composition in the simulation used to make the <lb/>measurement, is shown in Fig. 2(b). The uncertainty in the track <lb/>reconstruction efficiency resulting from this correction is ±0.4% in <lb/>the region |η| &gt; 1.5. <lb/>The resulting reconstruction efficiency as a function of η in-<lb/>tegrated over p T is shown in Fig. 2(c). The track reconstruction <lb/>efficiency is lower in the region |η| &gt; 1 due to particles passing <lb/>through more material in that region. The slight increase in ef-<lb/>ficiency at |η| ∼ 2.2 is due to the particles passing through an <lb/>increasing number of layers in the ID end-cap. Fig. 2(d) shows the <lb/>efficiency as a function of p T integrated over η. <lb/>A good description of the material in the detector in the regions <lb/>not probed by the method described above (which only probes <lb/>the material between the pixel and SCT detectors in the region <lb/>|η| &gt; 1.5) is needed to obtain a good description of the track re-<lb/>construction efficiency. The material within the ID was studied <lb/>extensively during Run 1 [29], where the amount of material was <lb/>known to within ±5%. This gives rise to a systematic uncertainty <lb/>in the track reconstruction efficiency of ±0.6% (±1.2%) in the most <lb/>central (forward) region. Between Run 1 and Run 2 the IBL was in-<lb/>stalled, the simulation of which must therefore be studied with <lb/>the Run 2 data. Two data-driven methods are used: a study of sec-<lb/>ondary vertices from photon conversions (γ → e + e − ) and a study <lb/>of secondary vertices from hadronic interactions, where the radial <lb/>position of the vertex is measured with good precision. Compar-<lb/>isons between data and simulation indicate that the material in <lb/>the IBL is constrained to within ±10%. This leads to an uncer-<lb/>tainty in the track reconstruction efficiency of ±0.1% (±0.2%) in <lb/>the central (forward) region. This uncertainty is added linearly to <lb/>the uncertainty from constraints from Run 1, to cover the pos-<lb/>sibility of missing material in the simulation in both cases. The <lb/>resulting uncertainty is added in quadrature to the uncertainty <lb/>from the data-driven correction. The total uncertainty due to the <lb/>imperfect knowledge of the detector material is ±0.7% in the most <lb/>central region and ±1.5% in the most forward region. <lb/>There is a small difference in efficiency, between data and sim-<lb/>ulation, of the requirement that each reconstructed track has at <lb/>least one pixel hit, at least six SCT hits, an innermost-pixel-layer <lb/>hit if expected (if a hit in the innermost layer is not expected, the <lb/>next-to-innermost hit is required if expected) and a track-fit χ 2 <lb/>probability greater than 0.01 for tracks with p T &gt; 10 GeV. This dif-<lb/>ference is assigned as a further systematic uncertainty, amounting <lb/>to ±0.5% for p T &lt; 10 GeV and ±0.7% for p T &gt; 10 GeV. <lb/>The total uncertainty due to the track reconstruction efficiency <lb/>determination, shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), is obtained by adding <lb/>all effects in quadrature and is dominated by the uncertainty from <lb/>the material description. <lb/>7. Correction procedure <lb/>The following steps are taken to correct the measurements for <lb/>detector effects. <lb/>• All distributions are corrected for the loss of events due to the <lb/>trigger and vertex requirements by reweighting events accord-<lb/>ing to the function: <lb/>w ev (n no−z <lb/>sel , η) = <lb/>1 <lb/>ε trig (n no−z <lb/>sel ) <lb/>• <lb/>1 <lb/>ε vtx (n no−z <lb/>sel , η) <lb/>, <lb/>where the η dependence is only relevant for n no−z <lb/>sel <lb/>= 1, as dis-<lb/>cussed in Section 6.2. <lb/>• The η and p T distributions of selected tracks are corrected us-<lb/>ing a track-by-track weight: <lb/>w trk (p T , η) = <lb/>1 − f sec (p T , η) − f sb (p T ) − f okr (p T , η) <lb/>ε trk (p T , η) <lb/>where f sec and f sb are the fraction of tracks from secondary <lb/>particles and from strange baryons respectively, determined <lb/>as described in Section 5. The fraction of selected tracks for <lb/>which the corresponding primary particle is outside the kine-<lb/>matic range, f okr (p T , η), originates from resolution effects and <lb/>is estimated from the simulation to be 3.5% at p T = 500 MeV, <lb/>decreasing to 1% for p T = 1 GeV and is only relevant for <lb/>2.4 &lt; |η| &lt; 2.5. No additional corrections are needed for the η <lb/>distribution. For the p T distribution a Bayesian unfolding [30] <lb/>is applied to correct the measured track p T distribution to that <lb/>for primary particles. <lb/>• After applying the trigger and vertex efficiency corrections, <lb/>the Bayesian unfolding is applied to the multiplicity distribu-<lb/>tion in order to correct from the observed track multiplicity to <lb/>the multiplicity of primary charged particles, and therefore the <lb/>track reconstruction efficiency weight does not need to be ap-<lb/>plied. The correction procedure also accounts for events that <lb/>have migrated out of the selected kinematic range (n ch ≥ 1). <lb/>• The total number of events, N ev , used to normalise the distri-<lb/>butions, is defined as the integral of the n ch distribution, after <lb/>all corrections are applied. <lb/>• The dependence of p T on n ch is obtained by first separately <lb/>correcting <lb/>i p T (i) (summing over the p T of all tracks and <lb/>all events) versus the number of selected tracks and the total <lb/>number of tracks in all events versus the number of selected <lb/>tracks, and then taking the ratio. They are corrected using the <lb/>appropriate track weights first, followed by the Bayesian un-<lb/>folding procedure. <lb/>Systematic uncertainties in the track reconstruction efficiency, <lb/>discussed in Section 6, and the fraction of tracks from non-primary <lb/>particles, discussed in Section 5, give rise to an uncertainty in <lb/>w trk (p T , η), directly affecting the η and p T distributions. For the <lb/>n ch distribution, where the track weights are not explicitly ap-<lb/>plied, the effects from uncertainties in these sources are found <lb/>by modifying the distribution of selected tracks in data. In each <lb/>multiplicity interval tracks are randomly removed or added with <lb/>probabilities dependent on the uncertainties in the track weights <lb/>of tracks populating that bin. This modified distribution is then <lb/>unfolded and the deviation from the nominal n ch distribution is <lb/>taken as a systematic uncertainty. An uncertainty from the fact <lb/>that the correction procedure, when applied to simulated events, <lb/>does not reproduce exactly the distribution from generated parti-<lb/>cles (non-closure) is included in all measurements. An additional <lb/>systematic uncertainty in the measured p T distribution arises from <lb/>possible biases and degradation in the p T measurement. This is <lb/>quantified by comparing the track hit residuals in data and simu-<lb/>lation. The effectiveness of the track-fit χ 2 probability selection in <lb/>suppressing tracks reconstructed with high momentum but origi-<lb/>nating from low momentum particles was also considered; it was <lb/>found that the fraction of these tracks remaining was consistent <lb/>with predictions from simulation. An uncertainty due to the sta-<lb/>tistical precision of the check is included for the p T distribution. <lb/>Uncertainty sources that also affect N ev partially cancel in the fi-<lb/>nal distributions. A summary of the main systematic uncertainties <lb/>affecting the η, p T and n ch distributions is given in Table 2. <lb/>Uncertainties in the p T vs. n ch measurement are found in the <lb/>same way as those in the n ch distribution. The dominant uncer-<lb/>tainty is from non-closure which varies from ±2% at low n ch to <lb/></body>

Results <lb/>The corrected distributions for primary charged particles in <lb/>events with n ch ≥ 1 in the kinematic range p T &gt; 500 MeV and <lb/>|η| &lt; 2.5 are shown in Fig. 3. In most regions of all distributions <lb/>the dominant uncertainty comes from the track reconstruction ef-<lb/>ficiency.

The measured distributions are <lb/>presented as inclusive distributions with corrections that rely min-<lb/>imally on the MC model used, in order to facilitate an accurate <lb/>comparison with predictions. <lb/>Fig. 3(a) shows the multiplicity of charged particles as a func-<lb/>tion of pseudorapidity. The mean particle density is roughly con-<lb/>stant at 2.9 for |η| &lt; 1.0 and decreases at higher values of |η|. epos <lb/>describes the data for |η| &lt; 1.0, and predicts a slightly larger mul-<lb/>tiplicity at larger |η| values. qgsjet-ii and pythia 8 monash predict <lb/>Fig. 3.

			<body>multiplicities that are too large by approximately 15% and 5% re-<lb/>spectively. pythia 8 a2 predicts a multiplicity that is 3% too low in <lb/>the central region, but describes the data well in the forward re-<lb/>gion. <lb/>Fig. 3(b) shows the charged-particle transverse momentum dis-<lb/>tribution. epos describes the data well over the entire p T spec-<lb/>trum. The pythia 8 tunes describe the data reasonably well, but <lb/>are slightly above the data in the high-p T region. qgsjet-ii gives a <lb/>poor prediction over the entire spectrum, overshooting the data in <lb/>the low-p T region and undershooting it in the high-p T region. <lb/>Fig. 3(c) shows the charged-particle multiplicity distribution. <lb/>The high-n ch region has significant contributions from events <lb/>with numerous MPI. pythia 8 a2 describes the data in the region <lb/>n ch &lt; 50, but predicts too few events at larger n ch values. pythia <lb/>8 monash, epos and qgsjet-ii describe the data reasonably well in <lb/>the region n ch &lt; 30 but predict too many events in the mid-n ch <lb/>region, with pythia 8 monash and epos predicting too few events <lb/>in the region n ch &gt; 100 while qgsjet-ii continues to be above the <lb/>data. <lb/>Fig. 3(d) shows the mean transverse momentum versus the <lb/>charged-particle multiplicity. The p T rises with n ch , from 0.8 to <lb/>1.2 GeV. This increase is expected due to colour coherence effects <lb/>being important in dense parton environments and is modelled by <lb/>a colour reconnection mechanism in pythia 8 or by the hydrody-<lb/>namical evolution model used in epos. If the high-n ch region is <lb/>assumed to be dominated by events with numerous MPI, with-<lb/>out colour coherence effects the p T is approximately independent <lb/>of n ch . Including colour coherence effects leads to fewer additional <lb/>charged particles produced with every additional MPI, with an <lb/>equally large p T to be shared among the produced hadrons [31]. <lb/>epos predicts a slightly lower p T , but describes the dependence <lb/>on n ch very well. The pythia 8 tunes predict a steeper rise of p T <lb/>with n ch than the data, predicting lower values in the low-n ch re-<lb/>gion and higher values in the high-n ch region. qgsjet-ii predicts a <lb/>p T of ∼ 1 GeV, with very little dependence on n ch ; this is ex-<lb/>pected as it contains no model for colour coherence effects. <lb/>In summary, epos and the pythia 8 tunes describe the data most <lb/>accurately, with epos reproducing the η and p T distributions and <lb/>the p T vs. n ch the best and pythia 8 a2 describing the multiplicity <lb/>the best in the low-and mid-n ch regions. qgsjet-ii provides an <lb/>inferior description of the data. <lb/>The mean number of primary charged particles in the central <lb/>region is computed by averaging over |η| &lt; 0.2 to be 2.874 ± <lb/>0.001 (stat.) ± 0.033 (syst.). This measurement is then corrected for <lb/>the contribution from strange baryons and compared to previous <lb/>measurements [1] at different <lb/>√ <lb/>s values in Fig. 4 together with the <lb/>MC predictions. The correction factor for strange baryons depends <lb/>on the MC model used and is found to be 1.0241 ± 0.0003 (epos), <lb/>1.0150 ± 0.0004 (pythia 8 monash) and 1.0151 ± 0.0002 (pythia <lb/>8 a2), where the uncertainties are statistical. qgsjet-ii does not in-<lb/>clude charged strange baryons. The prediction from epos is used <lb/>to perform the extrapolation and the deviation from the pythia 8 <lb/>monash prediction is taken as a systematic uncertainty and sym-<lb/>metrised to give 1.024 ± 0.009. <lb/>The mean number of primary charged particles increases by <lb/>a factor of 2.2 when <lb/>√ <lb/>s increases by a factor of about 14 from <lb/>0.9 TeV to 13 TeV. epos and pythia 8 a2 describe the dependence <lb/>on <lb/>√ <lb/>s very well, while pythia 8 monash and qgsjet-ii predict a <lb/>steeper rise in multiplicity with <lb/>√ <lb/>s. <lb/>9. Conclusion <lb/>Primary-charged-particle multiplicity measurements with the <lb/>ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC <lb/>at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV are presented.

The results highlight <lb/>clear differences between MC models and the measured distribu-<lb/>tions. Among the models considered epos reproduces the data the <lb/>best, pythia 8 a2 and monash give reasonable descriptions of the <lb/>data and qgsjet-ii provides the worst description of the data. <lb/></body>
