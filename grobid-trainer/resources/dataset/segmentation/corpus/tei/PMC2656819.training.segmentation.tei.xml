In contrast to the ionotropic <lb/>glutamate receptors which mediate the fast excitatory neurotransmission, mGlu receptors have been shown to play a more modulatory <lb/>role and have been proposed as alternative targets for pharmacological interventions. The potential use of mGluRs as drug targets for <lb/>various nervous system pathologies such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, pain or Parkinson&apos;s disease has triggered an intense <lb/>search for subtype selective modulators and resulted in the identification of numerous novel pharmacological agents capable to modulate <lb/>the receptor activity through an interaction at an allosteric site located in the transmembrane domain. The present review presents the <lb/>most recent developments in the identification and the characterization of allosteric modulators for the mGlu receptors. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Since their identification in the mid eighties [56] and their sub-<lb/>sequent cloning [18,31] in the early nineties, the metabotropic glu-<lb/>tamate receptor (mGluR) family triggered an intensive search to-<lb/>ward the identification of pharmacological agents to determine the <lb/>role of the mGlu receptors in the nervous system physiology and <lb/>patho-physiology. To date eight of such receptors (mGlu1-8) have <lb/>been cloned and based on their amino-acids sequence, pharmacol-<lb/>ogy and second messenger coupling these receptors have been clus-<lb/>tered into three groups (I -III) [4]. mGlu receptors belong to the <lb/>family 3 GPCRs and as such have a large extracellular ligand rec-<lb/>ognition N-terminal domain and seven transmembrane-spanning <lb/>regions that are connected by three intra-cellular and three extracel-<lb/>lular loops with a number of conserved cysteine residues [16]. The <lb/>extracellular ligand recognition N-terminal domain has a so-called <lb/>bi-lobed structure (= Venus fly-trap function) that can adopt an <lb/>open or closed configuration in the absence or presence of an ago-<lb/>nist, respectively [41]. In addition, there are indications that in the <lb/>brain functional mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors may predominantly <lb/>exist as homodimers [52]. Glutamate is the physiological agonist <lb/>for all mGlu receptors subtypes and as such the first selective <lb/>agents identified were glutamate analogs [54] and are acting at the <lb/>receptor by displacing Glutamate from its binding site located in the <lb/>N-terminal domain, the orthosteric site. As such those ligands are <lb/>named competitive agonists or antagonists. The structural analogy <lb/>to Glutamate, with the presence of a distal carboxylic acid to the <lb/>amino-acid functionality, strongly influence the properties of the <lb/>competitive ligands and limits considerably their capacity to cross <lb/>membranes by passive diffusion. As a consequence, these com-<lb/>pounds have a poor oral bioavailability, and do not readily cross the <lb/>blood-brain-barrier. A noticeable exception is illustrated by the <lb/>small molecular weight ligands, LY354740, LY379268 or <lb/>LY404039 [53] which display potent agonist activity at mGlu2/3 <lb/>receptors, are orally bioavailable, and enter the brain in preclinical <lb/>model [36,37] and have been developed throughout the clinic as <lb/>potential anti-panic agents [2]. <lb/>The difficulty to identify suitable glutamate analog with ade-<lb/>quate drug-like properties and subtype selectivity has been an im-<lb/>portant element that fostered the search for alternative structural <lb/>compound classes to inhibit or activate mGlu receptor function. <lb/>DISCOVERY <lb/>The identification of the allosteric modulators is intimately <lb/>linked with the development of in vitro assays allowing the charac-<lb/>terization of the functional activity of agents acting at the receptor. <lb/>For the Group I mGlu receptors, coupled to Gq type of G-proteins, <lb/>two cellular assays based on IP 3 turnover and measurements of <lb/>intracellular Ca 2+ concentration were developed (Fig. 1). <lb/></body>

			<body>For the Group II and III mGlu receptors, which are coupled to <lb/>Gi type of G-proteins, functional assays involving GTP--35 S bind-<lb/>ing and determination of cAMP concentration changes were devel-<lb/>oped (Fig. 2). <lb/>The development of these functional assays and their adaptation <lb/>to a high throughput screening mode allowed the screening of large <lb/>chemical libraries and the identification of numerous ligands with <lb/>no structural analogies to the natural ligand Glutamate acting as <lb/>negative allosteric modulators (NAM) or as positive allosteric <lb/>modulators (PAM). <lb/>A number of excellent reviews describing in the mechanism of <lb/>action and the progresses in the allosteric modulator field have been <lb/>published [13,14,20,44,45,50,55]. Here, we would like to describe <lb/>the most recent developments in the identification and characteriza-<lb/>tion of allosteric ligands for the various mGluR subtypes. <lb/>GROUP I <lb/>mGluR1 NAM <lb/>CPCCOEt (1) was the first non glutamate antagonist described <lb/>for the mGlu1 receptor [1]. This agent has been a useful tool to <lb/>investigate the role of the mGluR1 subtype in vitro, however, its <lb/>limited potency (only low micromolar IC 50 ), its lack of bio-<lb/>availability and brain penetration did not allow a broad use in vivo. <lb/>Nevertheless, CPCCOEt was identified as non-competitive inhibitor <lb/>and allowed to unravel and characterize the allosteric binding site <lb/>located in the transmembrane domain [28]. A more potent com-<lb/>pound, BAY36-7620 (2) was subsequently described to interact at <lb/>the same allosteric binding site and to inhibit the receptor constitu-<lb/>tive activity [3]. The improved in vivo properties of BAY36-7620 <lb/>has allowed the detection of an early signal for analgesic and anti-<lb/>convulsant effect but also for an impaired acquisition of a spatial <lb/>memory task (Morris water maze) [9,58]. This effect on memory <lb/>was later confirmed with highly optimized compounds. However, <lb/>various issues including potency has limited an extensive charac-<lb/>terization using this compound for the use of exploring the potential <lb/>of mGlu1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of various CNS <lb/>disorders. The first described highly potent, selective and systemi-<lb/>cally active mGlu1 receptor antagonist is JNJ16259685 (3) [25]. <lb/>JNJ16259685 is a non competitive antagonist with IC 50 values of <lb/>3.2 and 1.2 nM in glutamate-induced calcium mobilization at rat <lb/>and human receptors, respectively. In addition, systemic application <lb/>of JNJ16259685 resulted in high receptor occupancy at low dosis. <lb/>Together these data provide evidence that JNJ16259685 is an excel-<lb/>lent tool to explore the potential of mGlu1 receptor antagonists as <lb/>therapeutics [25]. Steckler et al. [60] described anxiolytic-like <lb/>properties in punished licking behavior which appeared to have <lb/>synergistic effects with mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Nevertheless, <lb/>the effects seem different from those for mGlu5 receptor antago-<lb/>nists as prominent effects were only seen on conflict procedures but <lb/>not on task based spontaneous exploration. Effects were described <lb/>on locomotor activity as expected from the expression pattern in <lb/>cerebellar structures but following chronic application data suggest <lb/></body>

			<body>tolerance to these motor disturbances. Subsequently, Steckler et al. <lb/>[61] described that JNJ16259685 impaired spatial acquisition proc-<lb/>esses, irrespective of spatial load, as well as spatial re-acquisition, <lb/>already at the lowest dose tested (0.63 mg/kg). Effects on spatial <lb/>retention performance were relatively mild in mice that had learned <lb/>to locate the position of the escape platform prior to treatment. <lb/>These data suggest that blockade of the mGlu1 receptor primarily <lb/>affects learning of new information, but leaves retention of spatial <lb/>information relatively unaffected. <lb/>Another potent and selective non-competitive mGlu1 antagonist <lb/>is A-841720 (4) [10]. At recombinant human and native rat <lb/>mGluR1 receptors, A-841720 inhibited agonist-induced calcium <lb/>mobilization, with IC 50 values of 10.7 and 1.0 nM, respectively, <lb/>while showing selectivity over other mGluR receptors. Intraperito-<lb/>neal injection of A-841720 potently reduced complete Freund&apos;s <lb/>adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain (ED 50 = 8 mg/kg) and mon-<lb/>oiodoacetate-induced joint pain (ED 50 = 15 mg/kg). A-841720 also <lb/>decreased mechanical allodynia observed in both the sciatic nerve <lb/>chronic constriction injury and L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) <lb/>models of neuropathic pain (ED 50 = 10 and 9 mg/kg, respectively). <lb/>Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that systemic administra-<lb/>tion of A-841720 in SNL animals significantly reduced evoked <lb/>firing in spinal wide dynamic range neurons. Importantly, signifi-<lb/>cant motor side effects were observed at analgesic doses and A-<lb/>841720 also impaired cognitive function in the Y-maze and the <lb/>Water Maze tests with no therapeutic index. The analgesic effects <lb/>of a selective mGluR1 receptor antagonist are associated with mo-<lb/>tor and cognitive side effects. <lb/>Taken together, the lack of separation between efficacy and side <lb/>effects in pre-clinical models indicates that mGluR1 antagonism <lb/>may not provide an adequate therapeutic window for the develop-<lb/>ment of such antagonists as therapeutics in humans. <lb/>mGluR1 PAM <lb/>Knoflach et al. [23] were the first to describe two chemical <lb/>series, compounds 5, 6 and 7 (Fig. 3), capable to potently increase <lb/>agonist-mediated responses in cells expressing the rat mGlu1 recep-<lb/>tor and in rat brain tissues. All three compounds were shown to <lb/>enhance the binding affinity of agonists for the orthosteric site. In <lb/>cells recombinantely expressing high level of the receptor and in <lb/>which the receptor shows a significant level of constitutive activity, <lb/>all three compounds were found to elicit a response in the absence <lb/>of orthosteric agonist. No similar effect was seen in native systems. <lb/>From the mechanistically point of view these effects were explained <lb/>by an interaction of the compound with an active form of the recep-<lb/>tor and the stabilization thereof. Compounds 5 and 7, showed selec-<lb/>tivity over the rmGlu2, rmGlu4, rmGlu5, rmGlu8 and hGABA B <lb/>receptors whereas compound 6 displayed a weak activation of the <lb/>glutamate-induced activation at the rmGlu5 receptor. Interestingly, <lb/>when tested on the human mGlu1 receptor only compound 6 acted <lb/>as positive modulator, compounds 5 and 7 being devoid of activity. <lb/>Furthermore, using chimeric receptor constructs and site directed <lb/>mutagenesis, Knoflach et al. [23], could demonstrate that all three <lb/>compounds interact in the transmembrane domain in an overlapping <lb/>pocket compared to the mGluR1 NAMS. Recently, a series of <lb/>structurally different mGlu1 positive modulators obtained by <lb/>chemical derivatization of the mGluR5 PAM CDPPB (15, Fig. 3) <lb/>Fig. (1).

			<body>was described and characterized. In contrast to the compounds 5, 7 <lb/>and 8, the CDPPB series was shown to interact in the transmem-<lb/>brane domain with a different binding mode compared to the <lb/>mGluR1 allosteric negative modulators [8]. <lb/>So far, no in vivo activity has been reported on the effects of <lb/>mGlu1 receptor PAMs, but based on the negative effects of NAMs <lb/>on learning and memory [10,61] it can be hypothesized that en-<lb/>hancement of mGlu1 receptor activity through a selective PAM <lb/>could be beneficial to restore normal learning and memory proc-<lb/>esses. <lb/>mGluR5 NAM <lb/>2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), 8 is the proto-<lb/>typical allosteric mGlu5 receptor antagonist [12]. It is a potent, <lb/>selective and systemically active antagonist. At the human mGlu5a <lb/>receptor expressed in recombinant cells, MPEP completely inhibits <lb/>quisqualate-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis with an <lb/>IC 50 value of 36 nM while having no agonist or antagonist activities <lb/>at other receptors up to 30 M. Schild&apos;s analysis indicated that <lb/>MPEP acts in a non-competitive manner. MPEP also inhibited to a <lb/>large extent constitutive receptor activity in cells transiently over-<lb/>expressing rat mGluR5, suggesting that MPEP may act as an in-<lb/>verse agonist [40]. <lb/>Using chimeras and single amino acid substitutions between <lb/>hmGluR1 and hmGluR5, binding of the mGluR5 radioligand [ 3 H]-<lb/>2-methyl-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl pyridine (M-MPEP) it could <lb/>be determined that the amino acids Ala-810 (TMVII), Pro-655 and <lb/>Ser-658 (TMIII) of the mGlu5 receptor are necessary to mediate the <lb/>binding and the selectivity of the MPEP series of antagonists. Con-<lb/>versely, the introduction of these three amino-acids in the corre-<lb/>sponding reciprocal position of the hmGlu1 receptor led to a mutant <lb/>mGlu1 receptor capable to bind [ 3 H]-M-MPEP with low nanomolar <lb/>affinity [40]. Radioligand binding to these mutants was also inhib-<lb/>ited by 7-hydroxyiminocyclopropan [b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid <lb/>ethyl ester (CPCCOEt), a structurally unrelated non-competitive <lb/>mGluR1 antagonist previously shown to interact within the TM <lb/>region of the mGlu1 receptor [28]. These results indicate that MPEP <lb/>and CPCCOEt bind to overlapping binding pockets in the TM re-<lb/>gion of group I mGluRs but interact with different non-conserved <lb/>residues. Several additional allosteric mGlu5 antagonists based on <lb/>the chemical structure of MPEP have been described and character-<lb/>ized, among those MTEP 9 a close derivative was also extensively <lb/>characterized [5,57]. <lb/>The identification of MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-<lb/>pyridine allowed the exploration of the therapeutic potential of this <lb/>class of compounds. Subsequent behavior studies revealed that--<lb/>with the exception of benzodiazepines--mGlu5 receptor antagonists <lb/>exhibit the widest and most robust anxiolytic activity in preclinical <lb/>models seen to date [59]. <lb/>Fenobam <lb/>Fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N&apos;-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-<lb/>1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea] (10) is an atypical anxiolytic agent, with <lb/>until recently an unknown molecular target, that has previously <lb/>been demonstrated both in rodents and human to exert robust anx-<lb/>iolytic-like activity. During a HTS screen at F. Hoffmann-La <lb/>Roche, Fenobam (McN-3377) was identified as a potent antagonist <lb/>at mGlu5 receptors [49]. Characterization revealed that Fenobam is <lb/>a selective and potent metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 receptor an-<lb/>tagonist acting at an allosteric modulatory site shared with 2-<lb/>methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP). Fenobam inhibited quis-<lb/>qualate-evoked intracellular calcium response mediated by human <lb/>mGlu5 receptor with IC 50 = 58 nM. It acted in a noncompetitive <lb/>manner, similar to MPEP and demonstrated inverse agonist proper-<lb/>ties, blocking 66% of the mGlu5 receptor basal activity (in an over <lb/>expressed cell line) with an IC 50 = 84 nM. [ 3 H]-Fenobam bound to <lb/>rat and human recombinant receptors with K d values of 54 and 31 <lb/>Fig. (3). mGluR1 allosteric modulators. <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>H <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>S <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>F <lb/>N <lb/>S <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>mGluR1 NAMs <lb/>mGluR1 PAM <lb/>1, CPCCOEt <lb/>2, BAY36-7620 <lb/>3, JNJ16259685 <lb/>(R199912) <lb/>4, A841720 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/></body>

			<body>nM, respectively. MPEP inhibited [ 3 H]-fenobam binding to human <lb/>mGlu5 receptors with a Ki value of 6.7 nM, indicating a common <lb/>binding site shared by both allosteric antagonists. Fenobam exhibits <lb/>robust anxiolytic-like activity with efficacy comparable to MPEP in <lb/>the stress-induced hyperthermia model, Vogel conflict test, Geller-<lb/>Seifter conflict test, and conditioned emotional response with a <lb/>minimum effective dose of 10 to 30 mg/kg p.o. Furthermore, Feno-<lb/>bam is devoid of GABAergic activity, confirming previous reports <lb/>that Fenobam acts by a mechanism distinct from benzodiazepines. <lb/>The non-GABAergic activity of Fenobam, coupled with its robust <lb/>anxiolytic activity supports the potential of developing mGlu5 re-<lb/>ceptor antagonists with an improved therapeutic window over ben-<lb/>zodiazepines as novel anxiolytic agents. The confidence in mGlu5 <lb/>receptor antagonists as a treatment for anxiety is obviously strongly <lb/>supported by positive results in clinical trials with patients. There <lb/>are at least two positive trials that indicate that Fenobam is indeed <lb/>efficacious in man including a double blind placebo-controlled and <lb/>standardized (Diazepam) trial [42,43]. It was concluded from these <lb/>studies that Fenobam relieved symptoms of anxiety in broad spec-<lb/>trum psychoneurotic patients which may experience anxiety as <lb/>cognitive, dysphoric or motor autonomic. The anxiolytic activity is <lb/>differentiated from benzodiazepines and fenobam was safe and <lb/>induced less sedation and drowsiness. Clearly, these findings need <lb/>to be confirmed in upcoming clinical trials using highly optimized <lb/>mGlu5 receptor antagonists but provide great promise for future <lb/>studies. <lb/>mGluR5 PAM <lb/>In contrast to the high number of NAM for the mGlu5 receptor, <lb/>relatively few positive allosteric modulators have been described. <lb/>The first series of compounds is based on a benzaldazine core struc-<lb/>ture and the pharmacological activity is determined by the nature <lb/>and the position of the substituents [38]. In this series, DFB (3,3&apos;-<lb/>difluorobenzaldazine, 11, Fig. 5), acts as positive modulator and <lb/>induces a marked increase in glutamate potency (EC 50 ). Interest-<lb/>ingly, a change in the nature of the substituent with a replacement <lb/>of the two fluorine atoms by a methoxy group conferred an antago-<lb/>nistic activity to the resulting DMeOB (3,3&apos;-dimethoxyBenzaldazine, <lb/>12, Fig. 5) derivative. Another very subtle substitution change, <lb/>chlorine for the fluorine atoms, led to the identification of a ligand <lb/>with no functional activity at the receptor, DCB (3,3&apos;-dichloro-<lb/>benzaldazine, 13, Fig. 5). The DFB family of modulators is the first <lb/>to demonstrate the whole range of pharmacological activities from <lb/>activation to inactivation of the receptor as well as neutral/silent <lb/>receptor ligands. All active derivatives of this series are interacting <lb/>in the transmembrane domain in a similar but not identical binding <lb/>site to the mGluR5 NAMs of the MPEP structural family. Shortly <lb/>after, two novel, structurally unrelated series illustrated by the pro-<lb/>totypic compounds CPPHA (14) and CDPPB (15) were described <lb/>by the same research group [27,39]. Both compounds showed a <lb/>potent increase of agonist mediated receptor activation for both <lb/>human and rat receptors with no cross reactivity at the other mGluR <lb/>subtypes nor at other CNS receptors. No activation of the receptor <lb/>was seen when DFB or CPPHA were used in the absence of orthos-<lb/>teric agonist [39] whereas CDPPB alone was capable to induce <lb/>a receptor activation [22]. All three compounds had no effect on <lb/>the binding of the orthosteric ligand [ 3 H]-quisqualate [22,39] <lb/>whereas only DFB and CDPPB did inhibit the binding of [ 3 H]-<lb/>methoxy-PEP-y [5] a derivative of the allosteric negative modulator <lb/>MPEP. Despite intense medicinal chemistry efforts, neither the <lb/>DFB nor CPPHA series did not deliver suitable molecules for in <lb/>vivo evaluation in preclinical models. In contrast, derivatization of <lb/>the CDPPB series not only allowed the identification more potent <lb/>derivatives but also the identification of mGluR1 positive allosteric <lb/>modulators [8]. <lb/>Fig. (4). mGluR5 allosteric modulators. <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>S <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>Cl <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>N <lb/>H <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>F <lb/>OH <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>NH <lb/>O <lb/>CN <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Cl <lb/>Cl <lb/>8, MPEP <lb/>9, MPEP <lb/>10, Fenobam <lb/>mGluR5 NAMs <lb/>mGluR5 PAMs <lb/>11, DFB <lb/>14, CPPHA <lb/>15, CDPPB <lb/>12, DMeOB <lb/>13, DCB <lb/></body>

			<body>In vivo, CDPPB was evaluated in two behavioral models sensi-<lb/>tive to antipsychotic: the amphetamine-induced locomotor activity <lb/>and the amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition <lb/>(PPI) in rat. In both models, CDPPB showed a dose dependent <lb/>beneficial effect without noticeable side-effects [22]. These results <lb/>demonstrated for the first time the in vivo activity of a selective <lb/>mGluR5 allosteric positive modulator and suggested a potential use <lb/>of these type of modulator as anti-psychotics. <lb/>GROUP II <lb/>mGluR2 NAM <lb/>Since the publication of two series of mGluR2 NAMs by Kol-<lb/>czewski et al. [24] and Wichmann et al. [63] no further develop-<lb/>ment nor structurally novel mGluR2 NAMs have been described to <lb/>date. These two series illustrated by the compounds 16 and 17 (Fig. <lb/>4) were shown to inhibit agonist stimulated GTP--[ 35 S] binding on <lb/>a rat mGluR2 transfected cell membranes with sub-micromolar <lb/>IC 50 . Both lead compounds were also shown to be selective over <lb/>mGluR1, mGluR4, mGluR5 and ionotropic GluRs but no data was <lb/>published for the selectivity over the mGluR3 or other CNS recep-<lb/>tors. Based on the effects achieved with orthosteric antagonists, it <lb/>could be speculated that mGluR2 NAMs could improve cognitive <lb/>and or memory disturbances [17]. <lb/>mGluR2 PAM <lb/>Among all mGlu receptor subtypes, the activation of the Group <lb/>II subtypes is by far the best studied thanks to the identification and <lb/>development by Eli Lilly of the orthosteric agonist LY354740 <lb/>[36,37]. This compound and its prodrug derivative (LY544344) <lb/>have been extensively characterized in preclinical model for anxiety <lb/>related disorders and subsequently developed in the clinic where <lb/>their use demonstrate the usefulness of activation of Group II recep-<lb/>tors for the treatment of anxiety related disorders [26]. This proof of <lb/>principle with LY354740 also confirms that activation of the <lb/>mGluR2,3 subtypes display therapeutic activity at doses which are <lb/>devoid of the side effects typically observed with agents interacting <lb/>with the ionotropic glutamate receptors. <lb/>The search for orthosteric ligands derived from the original <lb/>structure, LY354740, with similar pharmacological and drug-<lb/>like properties proved to be extremely difficult and prompted the <lb/>search for alternative structures. As for the Group I, the use of func-<lb/>tional assays combined with the screening of chemical libraries <lb/>allowed the identification of the first series of positive allosteric <lb/>modulators: the sulfonamide derivatives such as LY487379 (18) <lb/>[19]. LY487379 and analog compounds from the same chemical <lb/>class were shown to act as allosteric modulators with an activation <lb/>of the receptor only in the presence of an orthosteric agonist and no <lb/>displacement of the orthosteric antagonist LY341495. In contrast to <lb/>all known orthosteric agonists, LY487379 and its derivatives are <lb/>selective for the mGluR2 over the other seven mGluR subtypes <lb/>including the mGluR3 and over a binding battery of CNS relevant <lb/>receptor. In vivo, LY487379 or its derivatives demonstrated effi-<lb/>cacy in animal models for anxiety (Fear potentiated startle; Stress <lb/>induced hyperthermia) or for anti-psychotic activity (PCP induced <lb/>locomotor activity) [21]. A second series of compound was de-<lb/>scribed shortly after by a research group at Merck and exemplified <lb/>by the phenyl-tetrazolyl acetophenone derivative 19 (Fig. 5) <lb/>[7,46,47,48]. In vitro, this series of compounds showed a similar <lb/>profile to the LY487379 and in vivo the use of a more potent and <lb/>brain penetrable compound, BINA (20), confirmed the potential <lb/>anti-psychotic effects in animal models [11,15,48,51]. <lb/>Fig. (5). mGluR2 allosteric modulators. <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Cl <lb/>Cl <lb/>S <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>Cl <lb/>Cl <lb/>O <lb/>NMe 2 <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>S <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>HN N <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>HO <lb/>16 <lb/>mGluR2 NAMs <lb/>17 <lb/>mGluR2 PAMs <lb/>LY487379, 18 <lb/>19 <lb/>20, BINA <lb/></body>

			<body>Taken together these results that mGluR2 selective modulators <lb/>constitute a potential alternative for a pharmacotherapeutic inter-<lb/>vention to the orthosteric non-selective mGluR2,-3 agonists. <lb/>GROUP III <lb/>mGluR4, 6, 7, 8 NAMs <lb/>Compared to the Group I and II mGluR, the pharmacology of <lb/>the Group III is the least developed with a lack of subtype selective <lb/>negative modulators. To our knowledge, only one series of com-<lb/>pounds claimed in a patent (WO02102807; EP1408042 A1) has <lb/>been described. Within this series compound 23 is described as a <lb/>selective allosteric negative modulator of the mGluR7 with an IC 50 <lb/>of 7 nM. <lb/>mGluR4 PAM <lb/>For the mGlu4 receptor, two compounds have been identified, <lb/>PHCCC, 21 [29] and SIB1893, 22 [33] both originally discovered <lb/>as antagonist for the mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors, respectively. <lb/>MPEP, 8 was also identified as potentiator of the mGluR4 but at <lb/>very high concentrations (50-100 m) which are several order of <lb/>magnitude higher than the effective concentrations needed to inhibit <lb/>the mGlu5 receptor. <lb/>In rat brain slices, using CPCCC Valenti et al. [62] could dem-<lb/>onstrate that the mGlu4 receptor plays a key role in the Group III <lb/>mGluR modulation of the excitatory transmission in the substantia <lb/>nigra pars compacta (SNc), a key region involved in the nigral neu-<lb/>rodegeneration and the resulting movement disorders in Parkinson&apos;s <lb/>Disease. Unfortunately, the limiting drug-like properties of PHCCC <lb/>and the lack of more potent and selective mGluR4 PAM prevent the <lb/>validation in vivo in animal model of this putative use of mGluR4 <lb/>positive modulators. Additional potential pharmacotherapeutic uses <lb/>of mGluR4 modulators have been recently reviewed by Marino et <lb/>al. [30]. <lb/>mGluR7 PAM <lb/>As for the other members of the Group III receptors the lack of <lb/>suitable selective pharmacological tools slowed considerably the <lb/>study of the mGlu7 receptor. However, the generation and the char-<lb/>acterization of the mGluR7 knock-out mice indicated that amygdala <lb/>dependent functions such as conditioned fear, aversive responses <lb/>and responses to anxiety and stress related responses are altered <lb/>[6,32,35]. <lb/>The recent identification of a selective allosteric agonist, <lb/>AMN082 (24, Fig. 6) allowed the confirmation of the data obtained <lb/>with the mGluR7 null mice [34]. In vitro, AMN082 was shown to <lb/>potently activate the recombinantly expressed human mGlu7 recep-<lb/>tor with an EC 50 of 64 nM in the absence of orthosteric agonist. In <lb/>addition, AMN082 increases the orthosteric agonist (Glu, L-AP4) <lb/>induced receptor activation in analogy to the positive modulators at <lb/>the other mGluR subtypes. In vivo, AMN082 was shown to be <lb/>orally bioavailable, to penetrate into the brain and to modulate the <lb/>level of stress hormones (cortisol and ACTH) in wild type animal <lb/>but not in the mGluR7 ko mouse. Taken together this data demon-<lb/>strate that mGluR7 modulation could a valuable mechanism for the <lb/>pharmacotherapy of stress-related psychiatric disorders. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS/OUTLOOK <lb/>The ubiquitous distribution of glutamate in the brain sets off the <lb/>critical role of glutamate receptors in most major functions of the <lb/>CNS. Next to the ionotropic glutamate-gated ion channels, me-<lb/>tabotropic glutamate receptors modulate neuronal excitability, syn-<lb/>aptic transmission, and have various metabolic functions. Albeit <lb/>small, the Family III or Class C of G-protein-coupled receptors <lb/>have become the focal point for the discovery of new and exciting <lb/>modulators of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Exciting medicinal <lb/>chemistry that allowed the interaction of small molecules with re-<lb/>ceptors through soft touched allosteric modulation that modify <lb/>transmembrane signaling rather than compete for binding with the <lb/>natural agonist at orthosteric sites. Indeed, the mGlu receptors are <lb/>illustrative in the discovery of both positive and/or negative allos-<lb/>teric modulators that display a unique degree of subtype selectivity <lb/>within the highly conserved mGlu family of receptors. The combi-<lb/>nation of these pharmacological tools, in conjunction with genetic <lb/>approaches, has led to major advances in our understanding of the <lb/>roles of mGlu receptors in regulating of CNS function and animal <lb/>behavior. From cloning to the identification multiple receptors, sub-<lb/>type selective allosteric modulators and testing in double blind pla-<lb/>cebo controlled trials in less than 15 years is a remarkable story. <lb/>These developments provide us with the unique opportunity for <lb/>better treatments in a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric <lb/>disorders that include complicated disease states such as depression, <lb/>anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. <lb/></body>
