			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major staple crop in Africa, Asia, and South <lb/>America, and its starchy roots provide nourishment for 800 million people worldwide. <lb/>Although native to South America, cassava was brought to Africa approximately 400 <lb/>years ago and is now widely cultivated across sub-Saharan Africa. The widespread use <lb/>of clonal planting material, however, aids the spread of disease. Breeding for disease <lb/>resistance and improved yield began in the 1920s and has accelerated in the last 45 <lb/>years. To assist in the rapid identification of markers for pathogen resistance and crop <lb/>traits, and to accelerate breeding programs, we generated a framework map for M. <lb/>esculenta Crantz derived from reduced representation sequencing (genotyping-by-<lb/>sequencing [GBS]). The composite 2,412 cM map integrates ten biparental maps <lb/>(comprising 3,480 meioses) and organizes 22,403 genetic markers on 18 <lb/>chromosomes, in agreement with the observed karyotype. The map anchors 71.9% of <lb/>the draft genome assembly and 90.7% of the predicted protein-coding genes. The <lb/>resulting chromosome-anchored genome sequence provides an essential framework for <lb/>identification of trait markers and causal genes as well as genomics-enhanced breeding <lb/>of this important crop. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is cultivated as a staple in much of Africa, South <lb/>America and Asia as it is easy to grow with limited inputs (HOWELER et al. 2013). <lb/>Smallholder farmers typically grow cassava in plots of a hectare or less. Its starchy <lb/>roots can be left in the ground until they are needed, making cassava an excellent food <lb/></body>

			<body>security crop. Since cassava can be clonally propagated, desirable varieties can be <lb/>genetically fixed immediately and multiplied for distribution. The crop is relatively <lb/>drought tolerant, and hence likely robust to climate change. Cassava is also grown for <lb/>industrial starch production and biofuel applications, particularly in Southeast Asia <lb/>(HOWELER et al. 2013). <lb/>Despite its advantages, cassava faces several biotic and abiotic challenges. <lb/>Clonal propagation facilitates the rapid spread of bacterial and viral diseases. <lb/>Furthermore, roots of most farmer-preferred varieties are nutrient poor and deteriorate <lb/>rapidly post-harvest, preventing farmers from generating income from the sale of excess <lb/>crop. <lb/>The use of modern genetic and genomic techniques, such as quantitative trait <lb/>locus (QTL) mapping, genomic selection, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), <lb/>and genetic engineering, can accelerate the pace of disease resistance locus <lb/>identification and trait improvement. However, these require a high-quality genome <lb/>assembly and a dense genetic map. A draft cassava genome assembly was generated <lb/>and covers 532.5 Mb (69%) of the estimated 770 Mb cassava genome (AWOLEYE et al. <lb/>1994). This assembly captures half of the genome sequence in the 487 largest <lb/>scaffolds, all longer than 258 kb, and 90% of the assembly is accounted for in 2,654 <lb/>scaffolds all longer than 23 kb; however these are not linked to chromosomes <lb/>(PROCHNIK et al. 2012). To date, a number of genetic maps have been generated for <lb/>cassava using different marker systems: restriction fragment length polymorphism <lb/>(RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), microsatellite, and isoenzyme <lb/>(FREGENE et al. 1997); simple sequence repeat (SSR) (OKOGBENIN et al. 2006); <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and SSR (KUNKEAW et al. 2010); <lb/>expressed sequence tag (EST) and EST-SSR (SRAPHET et al. 2011); SSR and EST-<lb/>derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (RABBI et al. 2012); and GBS-SNP <lb/>(RABBI et al. 2014a; RABBI et al. 2014b). These maps have low marker resolution and/or <lb/>do not resolve a complete set of linkage groups (LGs) representative of the 2n = 36 <lb/>karyotype of cassava (DE CARVALHO AND GUERRA 2002). Furthermore, the densest GBS-<lb/>derived SNP map anchors only 313.3 Mb (58.7%) of the reference genome assembly <lb/>(RABBI et al. 2014b). Since there are many cassava breeding programs, working with <lb/>varying accessions and trait(s) of interest, a broadly useful genetic map should include <lb/>markers that segregate in diverse populations. <lb/>A single biparental cassava cross rarely yields enough progeny to make a dense <lb/>map, and in any event, would only capture markers from a small sample of haplotypes <lb/>segregating in the species. We therefore merged ten maps derived from diverse parents <lb/>to produce a composite genetic map. In order to generate such a composite map, we <lb/>obtained one S1 and nine F1 populations (fourteen parents total) from African cassava <lb/>breeding projects. Markers were generated via GBS (ELSHIRE et al. 2011) and a map <lb/>was constructed from each of the ten crosses with JoinMap (VAN OOIJEN 2011). These <lb/>maps were merged with LPmerge (ENDELMAN AND PLOMION 2014) to generate a 2,412 <lb/>centiMorgan (cM) genetic map comprising 18 LGs, in agreement with the number of <lb/>chromosomes found cytogenetically (DE CARVALHO AND GUERRA 2002). Furthermore, <lb/>71.9% of the genome assembly was anchored to the genetic map. The resulting <lb/>chromosome-scale assembly will accelerate the application of a wide variety of modern <lb/>tools for crop improvement. <lb/></body>

			<body>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Generation of mapping populations: Nine biparental (F1) and one self-pollinated (S1) <lb/>crosses were performed (Table 1). Biparental populations NxA, KAR, NCAR, MT, <lb/>NDLAR and ARAL were generated from crossing blocks planted in four locations in <lb/>Tanzania: Naliendele (10°23&apos; S, 40°09&apos; E, altitude ~137 m above sea level [ASL]), <lb/>Kibaha (6°46&apos; S, 38°58&apos; E, ~162 m ASL), Ukiriguru (2°43&apos;23&quot; S, 33°1&apos;39&quot; E, 1229 m <lb/>ASL) and Maruku (1°24&apos;55&quot; S; 31°46&apos;48&quot; E, 1340 m ASL). Populations 412x425, MP4 <lb/>and MP5 were generated at International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) crossing <lb/>sites in Nigeria. Pedigrees of parents are shown in Table 2. Cassava stakes for <lb/>planting were obtained from research stations or farmers&apos; fields. For populations <lb/>developed in Tanzania (with the exception of ARAL) more than 4,000 hand pollinations <lb/>were performed according to Kawano (KAWANO 1980). Over 10,000 seeds were <lb/>generated with over 1,000 seeds per population except for population MT. After three <lb/>months, seeds were sown in trays and raised in a screen house for one month before <lb/>transplanting into the field at Makutupora research station in Dodoma, Tanzania. Poor <lb/>germination rates resulted in a total of approximately 3,500 seedlings, with further <lb/>losses incurred during field establishment. <lb/>For the TMEB419 S1 cross, cassava stakes for planting were derived from the <lb/>NRCRI cassava breeding experimental plots and planted at a hybridization plot at <lb/>Ubiaja, Nigeria. Up to 5,000 hand pollinations were performed by selfing the same <lb/>variety using it as both male and female parents but with flowers and pollen from <lb/>different plants. About 800 seeds were generated. Seeds were sown in trays and raised <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>in a screen house for one month before transplanting into the field at NRCRI Umudike <lb/>experimental field in Nigeria. Poor germination rates resulted in a total of approximately <lb/>200 seedlings, with further losses incurred during field establishment. <lb/>DNA isolation: Genomic DNA was isolated from the F1 populations according to <lb/>Dellaporta et al. (1983), with some modifications to allow for processing of many <lb/>samples in parallel in small volumes. DNA was extracted from population TMEB419-S1 <lb/>using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer protocol. In all cases, <lb/>young apical leaves were first freeze-dried then ground using a GenoGrinder beadmill <lb/>at 1,500 strokes/min for 2 min. NxA, KAR, NCAR, MT, NDLAR and ARAL populations <lb/>were initially screened as in Kawuki et al. (2013) with approximately 12 SSR markers <lb/>that were polymorphic among the parents, to detect off-types and selfs. These were <lb/>removed from the population prior to GBS. Additional off-types, half-sibs, and selfs were <lb/>later detected by GBS and removed from mapping populations (see below). <lb/>Genotyping-by-sequencing library preparation and sequencing: GBS library <lb/>construction was performed at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) <lb/>using a protocol adapted from Elshire et al. (2011). The restriction enzyme ApeKI [New <lb/>England Biolabs (NEB)] was used in conjunction with the barcode sequences included <lb/>in the Elshire paper. Differences from their protocol following protocol optimization are <lb/>described below and discussed further in the Results and Discussion section. <lb/></body>

			<body>Y-shaped adapters were designed based on the Y-shaped Illumina DNA paired-end <lb/>(PE) adapters (Illumina, Inc.; Figure S1). &quot;Forward&quot; adapter oligos had the sequence 5&apos; <lb/>ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTxxxx, and &quot;reverse&quot; oligos the <lb/>sequence 5&apos; CWGyyyyAGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG; where <lb/>xxxx represents the 4-8 bp barcode and yyyy its reverse complement. CWG is the <lb/>ApeKI-specific overhang. Reverse oligos were phosphorylated at the 5&apos; end. Adapters <lb/>were ordered from IDT as a &quot;primer premix plate&quot;, with standard desalting, in a total <lb/>volume of 50 µl with each oligo at a concentration of 200 µM. Adapters were annealed <lb/>at 50 µM in TE using a thermocycler: 95°C 4 min, ramp -70°C at 0.1°C/5 sec, 25°C 5 <lb/>min, hold at 4°C. Annealing was confirmed by running adapters on a 4% agarose gel <lb/>next to single-stranded oligos of similar length, as annealed adapters run at a larger <lb/>size. Annealed adapters were diluted 1:10 and then to 12 ng/µl in TE, and finally to <lb/>1.25 ng/µl in 10 mM Tris pH 8. Adapter volumes for the last two dilutions were based on <lb/>quantitation with Picogreen reagent (Invitrogen) and an FLx800 microplate reader <lb/>(Biotek Instruments, Inc.). <lb/>Libraries comprised 63-96 samples. Sample DNA quantitation was performed <lb/>with Picogreen. Typically, DNA samples were diluted in water to approximately 20 ng/µl <lb/>and re-quantitated before library preparation. Digests were performed on a 96-well <lb/>plate, and each consisted of 100 ng DNA in 20 µl 1x NEBuffer #3 (NEB) with 5 U ApeKI. <lb/>Three microliters of the desired pre-annealed and diluted adapter was added to each <lb/>well of digested DNA, followed by ligation mix containing 720 cohesive end units T4 <lb/>DNA ligase and 5 µl T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer (NEB), to a final ligation volume of <lb/>50 µl. Ligations were pooled such that each offspring sample contributed an equal <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>amount of DNA. For parental DNA samples, in order to ensure adequate sequence <lb/>coverage a greater amount of digested/ligated DNA was added to the pool. Pools <lb/>contained a total amount of 1-2 µg DNA, and were purified and concentrated using the <lb/>MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). <lb/>Size selection was performed on pooled libraries using a 2% agarose gel run at <lb/>140 V. A size fraction of 400-800 bp was excised from the gel and purified via the <lb/>MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), melting the gel at room temperature to avoid G-C <lb/>bias (QUAIL et al. 2008). Most libraries were amplified with five PCR cycles using <lb/>Phusion polymerase (NEB), 460 ng of each PCR primer, and an extension time of 45 <lb/>seconds. After PCR amplification, libraries were cleaned using 0.7 volumes AMPure <lb/>XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Size distributions of Illumina libraries were <lb/>assayed by the Vincent Coates Genomic Sequencing Laboratory (VCGSL) at UC <lb/>Berkeley using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Library concentrations <lb/>were determined by the VCGSL using a Qubit (Life Technologies) and quantitative <lb/>PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed with Kapa Biosystems&apos; Illumina Library <lb/>Quantification Kits and and Roche LightCycler 480, following all kit protocols. One <lb/>hundred basepair paired-end sequencing was performed by the VCGSL on HiSeq 2000 <lb/>or 2500 instruments (Illumina, Inc.). Some libraries were sequenced more than once, <lb/>usually because the first run was suboptimal. Sequence read totals for each population <lb/>are given in Table 3. <lb/>Genotype calling and filtering: GBS data were analyzed by pipelining several widely <lb/>used sequence analysis tools with custom scripts to extract markers with parental <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>genotype combinations useful for the cross-pollinated (CP) genetic mapping strategy <lb/>implemented by JoinMap (v4.1 2013, July 11 release) (VAN OOIJEN 2011). An outline of <lb/>the pipeline is shown in Figure 1 and step-by-step command-line instructions are <lb/>available at https://bitbucket.org/rokhsar-lab/gbs-analysis. <lb/>To ensure high-quality data for genetic map estimation, the raw read data were <lb/>trimmed of adapter sequences with the fastq-mcf tool from the ea-utils package <lb/>(ARONESTY 2011), demultiplexed with an allowance of one mismatch in the barcode <lb/>sequence using a custom script, and then base-quality trimmed (Q=28) and aligned to <lb/>the cassava v4.1 draft genome assembly using BWA (LI AND DURBIN 2009). Variants <lb/>and genotypes were called using the HaplotypeCaller tool from the GATK (v2.7-2) <lb/>(MCKENNA et al. 2010) with a minimum mapping quality threshold of 25. As map-<lb/>estimation software can be sensitive to excessive missing data and genotyping error, <lb/>genotypes with quality scores and read depths less than 30 and 10x, respectively, were <lb/>marked as missing data and sites with over 20% missing genotypes were discarded. To <lb/>avoid spurious genotype calls within repeat regions, sites with average depth greater <lb/>than approximately 120 reads per individual or with log 10 (GATK HaplotypeScore+1) <lb/>values greater than 0.5 were removed. A maximum log 10 (GATK HaplotypeScore+1) <lb/>value of 1.0 was enforced for the ARAL and 412x425 populations because they had <lb/>been sequenced more deeply. <lb/>Further filtering removed individuals with either insufficient data or half-sib, off-<lb/>type, or (for biparental crosses) self-pollinated individuals (see below). The chi-squared <lb/>P-value for F1 Mendelian ratios was then calculated for each variant site, and sites with <lb/>P &lt; 0.05 were discarded. Parental genotypes were then inferred from the segregation <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>pattern of each marker in the progeny and this information was used to impute missing <lb/>parental genotypes in either parent. Markers were then grouped into non-overlapping 50 <lb/>kb bins and one marker of each segregating type (i.e., lm x ll, nn x np, hk x hk, ef x eg, <lb/>and ab x cd) with the most genotyped individuals was chosen to represent each bin. <lb/>Identification of off-types, half-sibs, and selfs in the progeny: Cassava farmers <lb/>prefer to grow several varieties in a field at one time and this often leads to volunteer <lb/>seedlings and hence genetic variability within nominally clonally propagated cassava. <lb/>This can create spurious genetic variation within varieties used to generate populations. <lb/>We therefore checked the progeny from each biparental mapping population for the <lb/>presence of off-types, half-sibs and selfs. We used metrics of relatedness to determine <lb/>whether a progeny was a full-sib F1 (or S1). First, we used the frequency of genotypes <lb/>violating, or inconsistent with, the expected Mendelian patterns of segregation. We <lb/>defined this as the fraction of genotypes homozygous for the minor/unshared parental <lb/>allele (or contained non-parental alleles) per individual. Individuals with a rate of <lb/>Mendelian inconsistency in excess of 0.005 at a minimum genotype quality of 30 were <lb/>discarded (Figure 2A). <lb/>Secondly, a bivariate clustering analysis was performed with the Mclust (v4.2) R <lb/>package using as the similarity measure the kinship coefficient phi calculated by <lb/>vcftools (v0.1.12) (MANICHAIKUL et al. 2010; DANECEK et al. 2011; FRALEY et al. 2012; R <lb/>CORE TEAM 2014). Values of phi were calculated between all individuals and the <lb/>putative parents, each parent constituting an axis of potential genetic contribution <lb/>(Figure 2B). Mclust calculates the optimal number of clusters under a Bayesian <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>Information Criterion (BIC) regime for a given set of candidate multivariate Gaussian <lb/>mixture models, the parameters for which are estimated via the Expectation-<lb/>Maximization algorithm. Individuals are then classified into clusters by choosing the <lb/>maximum conditional probability among the Gaussian distributions of the chosen <lb/>mixture model (FRALEY et al. 2012). Individuals belonging to a single cluster, or several <lb/>overlapping clusters, near (X,Y) = (0.25,0.25) were kept for downstream analysis. We <lb/>performed a univariate analysis on the S1 population data because Mclust assumes <lb/>that the two variables of the bivariate normal distribution do not have covariance near <lb/>unity, and performing a bivariate analysis on an S1 population would violate this <lb/>assumption. <lb/>Calculating genetic maps for single populations: A genetic map was produced for <lb/>each F1 mapping population using JoinMap software to estimate linkage, map order, <lb/>and distance. To make mapping calculations more tractable, only one marker was <lb/>retained from a set of markers at the same genetic position and individuals with over <lb/>50% missing data were removed. For each population, the minimum LOD threshold for <lb/>grouping was determined by identifying grouping tree branches with stable marker <lb/>numbers over increasing consecutive LOD values. Groups with three or more markers <lb/>at the chosen minimum LOD threshold were retained for mapping. Specific LOD <lb/>thresholds applied to each map are available in Table 4. Marker order and distances <lb/>were determined using JoinMap&apos;s Maximum Likelihood mapping algorithm for cross-<lb/>pollinated (CP) populations. Default mapping parameters were assumed with the <lb/>following modifications: spatial sampling thresholds reduced to 0.050, 0.025, 0.015, <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>0.010 and 0.005, and the number of Monte Carlo EM cycles increased to a value of 7. <lb/>Maps were then compared to each other as a check for internal consistency (see next <lb/>section) and genetically redundant markers that had been removed earlier were <lb/>reincorporated into the component maps by assigning each marker to the LG and <lb/>genetic position of the marker that was physically closest to it. The scaffolds in the draft <lb/>assembly were used to determine physical distance. Finally, each map was converted <lb/>from Haldane to Kosambi map units prior to merging. <lb/>Quality control of component maps: Maps containing inter-marker genetic distances <lb/>of 50 cM or greater were remapped with increased simulated annealing chain length <lb/>and stopping chains. This process was iterated until maps no longer contained such <lb/>distances or JoinMap ran out of memory. If these distances could not be removed <lb/>before memory failure, individual markers near the interval with extreme values of <lb/>&quot;Nearest Neighbor Fit&quot; (a measure reported by JoinMap to indicate the compatibility of <lb/>one marker between two flanking markers) were removed by trial and error <lb/>(recalculating the genetic map after each iteration) (removed markers are listed in File <lb/>S1). If this failed to fix the gap, the LG was split manually into two sets of parent-specific <lb/>markers (i.e. lm x ll and nn x np). Separate linkage maps were calculated for each <lb/>parent using the methods described above. Single-parent maps that broke at the <lb/>location of the initial marker gap were included for merging. <lb/>The relative correspondences and orientations of component LGs between <lb/>populations were determined by examining dotplots, plotting the genetic positions of <lb/>markers between pairs of maps (Figure 3). LGs were split or joined by following majority <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>rule of the set of cognate LGs. For example, a component LG sharing markers with two <lb/>LGs in each of the other component maps was split; multiple smaller LGs in one <lb/>component map sharing markers with a single LG in each of the other component maps <lb/>were joined. In joining, an interval was inserted equal to the average genetic distance <lb/>found in the other corresponding component groups. <lb/>Merging maps with LPmerge: We chose the ARAL map to be the reference for <lb/>numbering and orienting LGs during merging (Table S1) because it was deeply <lb/>sequenced and this map had the best agreement between genetic and physical marker <lb/>order. The initial numbering of LGs followed that produced by JoinMap. As described <lb/>above (Figure 3), a set of corresponding LGs and orientations was constructed for each <lb/>of the 18 chromosomes in cassava. Each of these sets of corresponding LGs was <lb/>merged into a composite map with LPmerge v. 1.4 (ENDELMAN AND PLOMION 2014), with <lb/>maps being weighted by population size. LPmerge was run ten times with the maximum <lb/>interval parameter set to each of the values in the range 1-10. We then chose the <lb/>merged map with the value of maximum interval that gave the shortest total composite <lb/>map length, as described in the documentation for LPmerge. For most LGs, the value of <lb/>maximum interval was 1 (Table S1). <lb/>Each merged map was plotted along with all its component maps on a plot of <lb/>marker number against genetic map distance. We noticed that markers at the end of <lb/>some LGs (see e.g. Supplemental Figure 2) were tens of cM distant from adjacent <lb/>markers. These markers were found to be present in only one contributing map and <lb/>were distorting the merged map distances calculated by LPmerge. To fix this, terminal <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>markers from single contributing maps were removed and another round of merging <lb/>with LPmerge was performed. This process was repeated until there were no singleton <lb/>markers at the end of a LG. <lb/>Correcting scaffolding mis-assemblies: Mapped markers from all ten maps were <lb/>considered simultaneously. Scaffolds from the v4.1 assembly (PROCHNIK et al. 2012) <lb/>containing markers that mapped to different LGs were broken as long as the markers on <lb/>the different LGs were derived from at least two maps or there were at least two <lb/>markers from a single map. Mean pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) r 2 statistics <lb/>(PURCELL et al. 2007) were calculated using vcftools (DANECEK et al. 2011) for all <lb/>variants derived from putatively mis-assembled scaffolds. Scaffolds were broken at <lb/>scaffolding gaps within each region flanked by markers of different LG assignments if no <lb/>evidence of LD was observed. If multiple scaffolding (i.e. sequence) gaps existed <lb/>between flanking markers, the gap with the fewest supporting mate-pairs used for <lb/>scaffolding the v4.1 assembly was broken. If multiple, equally supported gaps existed, <lb/>the scaffold was broken at the largest gap. Minority markers from unbroken candidate <lb/>mis-assembled scaffolds were removed. <lb/>Scaffold anchoring and orienting: After breaking mis-assembled scaffolds, the v4.1 <lb/>genome assembly was anchored to the genetic map and joined with 1000 Ns to <lb/>produce pseudomolecules. Scaffold order was determined by median genetic position <lb/>and orientation by the sign of Kendall&apos;s rank correlation coefficient (tau) between <lb/>physical and genetic positions. Scaffolds that could not be assigned to any LG (due to <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>ambiguity in grouping or lack of markers) were not incorporated into the <lb/>pseudomolecules and retained their original identifiers from the v4.1 assembly. <lb/>Scaffolds that were anchored but could not be oriented were incorporated in their <lb/>original (i.e. arbitrary) orientations. The LGs were then ordered by decreasing genetic <lb/>size and numbered with Roman numerals to provide a canonical nomenclature (Figure <lb/>4). <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>To produce a robust and dense genetic map that can be used to follow traits <lb/>segregating in diverse mapping populations, we generated ten mapping populations <lb/>(Table 1) and genotyped them using a modified GBS approach (ELSHIRE et al. 2011). <lb/>We were stringent in selecting markers, in order to both mitigate the effects of missing <lb/>data inherent in a GBS approach and to ensure that variants were segregating in a <lb/>Mendelian fashion. We then generated ten independent genetic maps from these <lb/>populations. Comparison between them allowed us to identify cases where the <lb/>standard map estimation approach was unable to resolve consistent LGs, and <lb/>reconciling these differences produced a highly concordant set of maps. After <lb/>constructing maps using a reduced set of stringently selected markers, we reintroduced <lb/>genetically redundant markers into the maps, and these individual component maps <lb/>were then integrated into a single composite framework map with the expected 18 LGs. <lb/>Finally, we used this map to organize the v4.1 draft cassava genome sequence <lb/>(PROCHNIK et al. 2012) into 18 pseudomolecules, anchoring 90.7% of the predicted <lb/>genes onto LGs. <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>Mapping populations: We analyzed nine F1 and one S1 mapping populations derived <lb/>from 14 diverse cultivated varieties of cassava segregating for agriculturally important <lb/>traits (Table 1). One population included here was recently used for a QTL analysis for <lb/>cassava mosaic disease (CMD) resistance (RABBI et al. 2014b). Due to their desirable <lb/>agricultural properties, some cultivars were used as parents in multiple crosses. Six <lb/>populations from the Ferguson group at IITA were selected specifically for segregation <lb/>of resistance to cassava brown streak disease. Several of these parents have a known <lb/>wild species component in their pedigree (Table 2). <lb/>Reduced representation sequencing: Several groups have developed inexpensive <lb/>methods for generating a reduced representation of a genome with a restriction enzyme <lb/>and sequencing to obtain genotypes (genotyping-by-sequencing or GBS) (ALTSHULER et <lb/>al. 2000; BAIRD et al. 2008; DAVEY et al. 2011; ELSHIRE et al. 2011). To generate <lb/>mapping markers in cassava, we adapted the GBS approach of Elshire et al. (2011) <lb/>(Materials and Methods). We used Y-shaped GBS adapters to ensure that all pieces of <lb/>DNA with adapter ligated to both ends could cluster and be sequenced. Since the same <lb/>barcode was added to both ends of the DNA extracted from a given individual (see <lb/>Figure S1), checking for the identity of barcodes from both ends provided additional <lb/>quality control. To save time, we dispensed with the DNA and adapter drying step <lb/>before digestion. To allow for robust ligation we phosphorylated the &quot;reverse&quot; oligos of <lb/>our adapters at the 5&apos; end (Figure S1); although this can increase the number of adapter <lb/>dimers, these dimers are effectively removed by size selection as noted below. To <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>maximize the number of DNA fragments that are ligated to adapters, we used adapters <lb/>in excess. This also prevents the formation of DNA concatemers, which would confound <lb/>downstream analysis of reads. To increase the accuracy of mapping reads to the <lb/>genome, the probability of detecting variation adjacent to a cut site, and the amount of <lb/>data, we performed 100 bp paired-end sequencing, rather than the single-end 86 bp <lb/>sequencing of Elshire et al. (2011). <lb/>During protocol optimization, we found that a gel-based size selection step <lb/>amplified the desired size fraction more robustly. Fragments of sizes 400-800 bp <lb/>cluster well on the flow cell yet are unlikely to contain adapter-mers. A gel-based size <lb/>selection also provides for modularity in GBS approach: excising a narrower size range <lb/>from the gel can be a simple way to sample fewer sites in the genome if fewer markers <lb/>or more depth per site are needed, and/or to facilitate multiplexing more samples per <lb/>lane. In the PCR, we used Phusion polymerase rather than Taq to minimize error, and <lb/>we found that increasing the amount of PCR primer yielded more amplified library. We <lb/>reduced the number of PCR cycles to five in order to reduce bias that can interfere with <lb/>accurate variant calling. The 0.7x ratio of SPRI beads to DNA removes fragments less <lb/>than 300 bp in length (QUAIL et al. 2008; LENNON et al. 2010), and thus effectively <lb/>removes any remaining adapter-mers and excess PCR primer (neither of which are <lb/>detected in appreciable amounts by Bioanalyzer on completed libraries). <lb/>Genotyping-by-sequencing performance in cassava: Our adapted GBS protocol <lb/>makes use of the ApeKI restriction enzyme used in the protocol developed by Elshire et <lb/>al. (2011) and recommended by Hamblin &amp; Rabbi (2014) for cassava. This enzyme and <lb/></body>

			<body>our method of library preparation allowed us to sample, per population, an estimated <lb/>85.5k restriction cut sites (with ten reads or more) distributed throughout the genome on <lb/>5,900 scaffolds (approximately 173 cut sites/Mbp) and sampling roughly 42K variable <lb/>loci. Multiplexing up to 96 samples per lane of sequencing was effective for our outbred <lb/>populations: we obtained an average of roughly 3.7M reads per individual in a typical <lb/>96-plex sequencing run. <lb/>Genotype calling, filtering, and quality control: We genotyped all individuals against <lb/>the currently available v4.1 draft cassava genome assembly with the GATK (MCKENNA <lb/>et al. 2010). Based on an examination of the relationship between minimum genotype <lb/>quality (GQ) threshold and the rate of violation of Mendelian segregation, we set a <lb/>minimum GQ of 30, which effectively filtered low-confidence genotype calls (Figure 2A). <lb/>In addition, we removed 44 individuals with excessive genotyping error or in which the <lb/>pattern of marker segregation was inconsistent with that expected in an F1 or S1 <lb/>population. <lb/>Since botanical seed-based fecundity is low in cassava, generating large <lb/>mapping populations often requires crossing multiple cloned parental genotypes over an <lb/>extended period of time, increasing the likelihood of error in tracking parental or progeny <lb/>genotypes. We therefore performed a relatedness analysis (Materials and Methods) to <lb/>identify and remove individuals that were not part of the intended cross (Figure 2B). <lb/>Across the ten populations, we found 14 individuals that were unrelated to both parents, <lb/>68 related to only a single parent (26 selfs, 2 clones, 40 half-sib offspring), and identified <lb/>119 additional individuals with more complex relationships not suitable for mapping. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>Individuals identified by the relatedness and/or the Mendelian violation analyses were <lb/>removed from further analysis. The number of progeny sequenced and used for map <lb/>construction from each population is listed in Table 1. In one extreme case, none of the <lb/>offspring in the MT population were related to the pollen parent that was sequenced <lb/>(putatively TMS4(2)1425) (Figure S3) and furthermore neither these offspring nor the <lb/>putative TMS4(2)1425 parent matched the TMS4(2)1425 parent of the 412x425 <lb/>population. We could, however, confirm that most members of the MT population were <lb/>full sibs. Given this fact, it was nevertheless possible to statistically infer reliable <lb/>genotypes for the true pollen parent and estimate the combined genetic map for the <lb/>population, as was performed for all other populations included in this study (see next <lb/>section). Each population of verified full-sib progeny was then subjected to a <lb/>significance threshold (P &lt; 0.05) for deviation from Mendelian genotype frequencies, <lb/>from which we obtained roughly 4,400 segregating sites per population (Table 4). <lb/>Calculating genetic maps: Genetic maps were estimated for each population using <lb/>the Maximum Likelihood mapping algorithm for CP populations implemented by <lb/>JoinMap (v4.1). Forty-four (22.6%) component LGs contained intervals 50 cM or larger <lb/>that could not be corrected by increasing the simulated annealing parameters and <lb/>required manual curation. In this curation, markers that were causing the large gaps <lb/>were identified by trial-and-error and removed. A total of 179 (out of 24,403 mapped) <lb/>markers were discarded (File S1). After this step, one LG still contained a large gap. For <lb/>this LG, a separate map was made from the markers unique to each parent and the <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>LGs split into two pieces at the position of the gap. Subsequently, shared markers were <lb/>reincorporated based on their scaffold coordinates. <lb/>Resolving discrepancies between maps, refining maps, and gauging accuracy: <lb/>Comparing the ten component linkage maps with each other allowed us to identify and <lb/>correct inconsistencies including incorrectly split or joined LGs. We were able to verify <lb/>long-range colinearity as the median number of markers shared between any two maps <lb/>was 793 (quartiles Q1=656, Q3=983), or approximately 44 per LG (Figure 3A). <lb/>Occasionally, the dotplot pattern of a LG was &apos;V&apos;-shaped (Figure 3B), indicating <lb/>inconsistent marker order (e.g. a mapping error or a possible inversion) in one of the <lb/>maps. In all but two cases (see below), the &apos;V&apos; shapes could be resolved into linear <lb/>relationships by increasing the simulated annealing parameters. <lb/>Most LGs had a one-to-one correspondence with an LG in each of the other <lb/>populations. However, using a majority rule approach, it was clear that two component <lb/>LGs required splitting and nine joins were needed. In one additional case, the decision <lb/>to break or join was ambiguous, as five populations each contained two LGs that <lb/>together corresponded to single LGs in the other five populations. We resolved this <lb/>ambiguity by jointly examining the dotplots for the two-LG component maps against a <lb/>corresponding single-LG map. From this, we discovered that none of the breaks in the <lb/>different two-LG component maps occurred at the same genetic position. It is therefore <lb/>likely that the LGs should be joined in the two-LG component maps to generate single <lb/>LGs. Finally, three component LGs were not included in the merging because they <lb/>could not be resolved into a map with a linear relationship with the corresponding LG <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>from the other maps, and four were discarded because, although they could be <lb/>matched with LGs in other maps, they contained too few markers to be confidently <lb/>oriented. <lb/>Comparing maps to one another using dotplots provides a visual measure of <lb/>internal consistency, while accuracy of marker order may be estimated by comparison <lb/>to the physical sequence. We calculated Kendall&apos;s rank correlation coefficient (tau) <lb/>between physical and genetic positions on scaffolds that contained 10 or more markers <lb/>and were not broken (described below). Across all maps and scaffolds examined, the <lb/>median value tau was 0.84 (quartiles Q1 = 0.748, Q3 = 0.908), indicating good <lb/>agreement between physical and genetic positions. <lb/>Reincorporation of genetically redundant markers: In order to more fully represent <lb/>the genetic diversity found within the mapping populations, 8,418 markers that had been <lb/>excluded earlier based on their genetic redundancy (Materials and Methods) were <lb/>reincorporated into the composite map. By creating datasets with the redundant <lb/>markers included before and after map integration, and then comparing their median <lb/>Kendall&apos;s rank correlation coefficients tau (for 46 scaffolds with 50 or more markers, <lb/>totaling 64.5 Mb of sequence), we found that including the redundant markers prior to <lb/>map integration increased the marker order accuracy (tau = 0.765 vs. tau = 0.726). <lb/>This improvement arises because the same genetically redundant marker is not always <lb/>chosen to represent its genetic position in all component maps, and reincorporating <lb/>redundant such markers increases the number of marker order constraints used by <lb/></body>

			<body>LPmerge (ENDELMAN AND PLOMION 2014) when a marker order conflict is encountered <lb/>during map integration. <lb/>An integrated framework map: With the exception of the three LGs noted above, the <lb/>component maps were colinear with each other (e.g. Figure 3A). We next combined <lb/>them into a single composite map. Genetic maps are merged by finding markers that <lb/>are shared between the individual maps. Ideally all shared markers will be colinear, <lb/>however in many situations discrepancies need to be resolved. Sometimes these <lb/>discrepancies could be due to rearrangements in the genome of one of the parents, but <lb/>most often are due to inaccurate genetic distances between markers because of <lb/>insufficient recombinations, the stochastic nature of recombination, and errors <lb/>introduced in individual map construction by missing and/or erroneous marker data. We <lb/>used LPmerge (ENDELMAN AND PLOMION 2014) to generate a composite map from the <lb/>ten component maps we had generated because it merges maps without recalculating <lb/>recombination frequencies, drastically reducing the computational time required. <lb/>LPmerge generates a consensus map with the minimum absolute error relative to the <lb/>component maps, while preserving the marker order by imposing linear inequality <lb/>constraints and deleting a minimum number of constraints if a marker order conflict is <lb/>observed (ENDELMAN AND PLOMION 2014). <lb/>Combining maps from multiple independent crosses has the advantage of <lb/>increasing the genetic diversity that is captured in the map; increasing support for <lb/>marker order and position; and allowing markers from a single map to be placed relative <lb/>to other markers. Composite maps have been generated from six Diversity Array <lb/></body>

			<body>Technology [DArT]-and RFLP-based maps for sorghum (MACE et al. 2009), six SSR-<lb/>based maps for pigeonpea (BOHRA et al. 2012), and eleven SSR-based maps for <lb/>groundnut (GAUTAMI et al. 2012) but, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to <lb/>integrate this many GBS-SNP based genetic maps. <lb/>After merging, we noticed that markers at the ends of LGs that belonged to a <lb/>single map were placed on the merged map tens of cM from their neighbors (Figure <lb/>S2). To improve the merging, we removed terminal markers belonging to a single map <lb/>and repeated the merging until no further singleton markers remained. This removed a <lb/>total of 182 markers (Table S1) to generate a 2,412 cM map containing 22,403 markers, <lb/>averaging 134 cM and 1,245 markers per LG (Table 5, File S2). The SNP density (~9 <lb/>SNPs per cM) is substantially higher than that of the previous densest map (mean inter-<lb/>SNP distance = 0.52 cM, (RABBI et al. 2014b), although this straightforward statistic <lb/>does not account for the fact that many of the markers are genetically redundant (Table <lb/>5). For the first time, a cassava genetic map recapitulates the coherent set of 18 LGs <lb/>matching the cassava chromosomes (Figure 4). <lb/>We observed a steady increase (albeit with diminishing returns) in the number of <lb/>markers and amount of assembled sequence that can be placed as a function of the <lb/>number of mapping populations that were used (Figure 5). We note, however, that even <lb/>with the addition of the tenth component map, we were still adding more markers and <lb/>able to anchor more genome sequence (Figure 5). Future work will merge additional <lb/>maps to take advantage of this feature. However, because the majority of markers were <lb/>present in only one map (12,474 out of 22,403) they may be placed inaccurately in the <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>merged map as they are not constrained by more than one map. This will be improved <lb/>upon the generation of a less-fragmented genome assembly. <lb/>All maps were to a large extent colinear with the integrated framework map <lb/>(Figure S4), however, component LGs from NxA (see e.g. Chromosome II, Figure S4B) <lb/>as well as 412x425 (see e.g. Chromosome XVII, Figure S4Q) displayed notable <lb/>divergence from this, likely because these maps were of lower quality. Lastly, across <lb/>the whole genome, we observed four gaps larger than 10 cM (terminal portion of <lb/>Chromosome V; two on Chromosome III and one on Chromosome VIII). These could be <lb/>recombination hotspots or regions that are identical-by-descent and thus lack <lb/>polymorphisms. <lb/>Generation of chromosome pseudomolecules: One of our primary goals was to <lb/>organize the fragmented draft genome assembly (PROCHNIK et al. 2012) into <lb/>chromosome-scale sequence, therefore it was necessary to first detect possible <lb/>discrepancies between the genetic map and physical sequence. Of the 1,347 scaffolds <lb/>that contained multiple markers (median size = 174 kb), 41 scaffolds contained markers <lb/>along their lengths that mapped to different LGs. Since all component maps used to <lb/>generate the composite map were internally consistent, these discrepancies were <lb/>unlikely to be due to errors in the genetic map and suggested a sequence mis-assembly <lb/>in the scaffolds in question. Manual review, along with the aid of linkage disequilibrium <lb/>and scaffolding information, allowed us to break likely misjoins where weak scaffolding <lb/>linkages had been made, often in regions with a high density of scaffolding gaps. After <lb/>breaking, we then organized the sequence assembly into pseudomolecules by <lb/></body>

			<body>anchoring the scaffolds onto LGs using their median genetic position. The resulting <lb/>chromosome-scale sequences incorporate 1,608 scaffolds and 382 Mb (71.9%) of the <lb/>v4.1 draft genome sequence (Table 5). This includes 462 (94.9%) of the N50 scaffolds, <lb/>1,430 (53.9%) of the N90 scaffolds, and 27,825 (90.7%) of the 30,666 predicted protein-<lb/>coding genes. Of the scaffolds anchored onto the assembly, we could also orient 1,024 <lb/>(63.7%) of them by calculating the Kendall rank correlation coefficient tau between <lb/>physical and genetic positions. Together, these oriented scaffolds comprise 315 Mb of <lb/>sequence. <lb/>Concluding remarks: Here we present a consensus genetic map of cassava that <lb/>combines 10 mapping populations. Unlike many previous maps (FREGENE et al. 1997; <lb/>OKOGBENIN et al. 2006; KUNKEAW et al. 2010; SRAPHET et al. 2011; RABBI et al. 2012; <lb/>RABBI et al. 2014a; RABBI et al. 2014b) we recovered the 18 LGs predicted by the <lb/>karyotype of M. esculenta (DE CARVALHO AND GUERRA 2002) and at the same time <lb/>dramatically increased the number of markers to over 22,400. The vast majority of <lb/>genes in the current draft genome were placed on a LG and at their approximate <lb/>chromosomal position, resulting in the first chromosome-scale assembly of cassava and <lb/>a map that will serve as a valuable guide for future genome assembly improvements. <lb/>Our approach can be readily extended to include future mapping populations, although <lb/>as seen here care must be taken to explore discrepancies between biparental or selfed <lb/>maps that may arise from mistaken parentage, missing or erroneous data, and the <lb/>details of map construction. Using multiple maps at the same time allows such <lb/></body>

Shared markers hence reveal <lb/>the correspondences and relative orientations between LGs produced by JoinMap (arbitrarily numbered). <lb/>Runs of shared markers appearing as roughly straight, continuous lines demonstrate marker orders <lb/>consistent between the two maps; a positive or negative gradient indicates identical or opposite <lb/>orientation, respectively, in the two maps. In addition, LGs to be joined or split are revealed, respectively, <lb/>as multiple unusually small LGs in one map corresponding to a single LG in another map (NCAR LG 3, <lb/>and KAR LGs 13 and 14) and as a single unusually large LG in one map corresponding to multiple LGs in <lb/>the other (NCAR LGs 7 and 9, and KAR LG 1). (B) An example of a &apos;V&apos;-shaped dotplot pattern, typically <lb/>observed in LGs that required (and could be corrected with) JoinMap parameters that increased the <lb/>sensitivity (see Materials and Methods). <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ + <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+

CW259-42 is a backcross of MTAI 8 (Rayong 60) and an interspecific <lb/>cross between M.e. ssp flabellifolia and CM 2766-5. <lb/>Kiroba <lb/>Farmer variety from Tanzania. <lb/>NDL06/132 <lb/>Breeding line selected at Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) Naliendele in <lb/>southern Tanzania. It is an S1 of variety NAL90/34 which showed strong <lb/>resistance to CBSD (HILLOCKS AND JENNINGS 2003) and is half sib of Kibaha, <lb/>which has M.e. ssp. flabellifolia background. <lb/>Mkombozi <lb/>It is a half sib of 92/0099S2(SM). 92/0099 is a cross 91934 x 81/00032. <lb/>91934 is 58308 x Ogunjobi, and 81/00032 is a cross between U/1421 and P-<lb/>2. Also known as MM96/4684. 58308 is from Amani material selected at <lb/>Moore Estate, and thus has wild species introgression in its pedigree. <lb/>Nachinyaya <lb/>Farmer variety from Tanzania. <lb/>Albert <lb/>Farmer variety from Tanzania. <lb/>TMS-IBA4(2)1425 58308 x Oyarugba Funfun. <lb/>AR37-80 <lb/>A CIAT cross between a CMD resistant line (C33) from IITA and CW259-42. <lb/>TMEB419 <lb/>TMEB419 is a clone collected in Togo with an unknown pedigree, and <lb/>released as a variety in Nigeria in 2005 with the name TME419. It is also <lb/>known by the name Gbasekoute. TMEB419 is very popular all over Nigeria <lb/>and many other African countries where it has been introduced because it <lb/>has high dry matter and starch content. The quality of food products from it <lb/>such as gari and fufu are excellent. It also has erect stems with minimal <lb/>branding, which facilitates intercropping as well as higher planting densities. <lb/>TMS-IBA011412 Cloned in 2001, this is an improved IITA variety with resistance to CMD and it <lb/>accumulates provitamin A carotenoids in its storage roots. It is the progeny of <lb/>a cross between TMS-IBA950971 and TMS-IBA940561. <lb/>TMS-IBA30001 <lb/>One of the early TMS series of clones derived from early CMD resistance <lb/>breeding work in West Africa. It traces its ancestry to variety 58308 which <lb/>came from interspecific crosses with M. glaziovii. <lb/>TMS-IBA961089A TMS-IBA961089A is an improved variety from IITA that shows strong <lb/>resistance to CMD that is likely to be a result of its parentage. Its female <lb/>parent is TMS-MOK940461, a half-sib of Nigerian landrace TMEB9, which <lb/>possesses qualitative resistance to CMD. Its other parent, TMS-IBA9001554, <lb/>is a half-sib of TMS-IBA30572, an improved variety cloned in 1973, with <lb/>quantitative resistance to CMD that is derived from variety 58308, a hybrid <lb/>derived directly from recombination of the M. glaziovii × M. esculenta triple-<lb/>backcrosses. <lb/></body>
