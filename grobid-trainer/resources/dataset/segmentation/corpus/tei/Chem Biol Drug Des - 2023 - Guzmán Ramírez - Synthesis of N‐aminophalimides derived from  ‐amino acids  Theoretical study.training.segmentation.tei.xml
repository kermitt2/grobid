			<body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>Phthalimide is an aromatic imide with two carbonyl groups <lb/>bounded to amine moiety and used in organic synthesis for <lb/>the preparation of a wide variety of compounds with differ-<lb/>ent substituents in both the aromatic ring and the nitrogen <lb/>atom. These compounds are attractive for their biological ac-<lb/>tivities (Sharma et al., 2010) among them, as antibacterial, <lb/>antifungal, antimicrobial, anticancer (Ahmed et al., 2016; <lb/>Akgün et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2009; Tandon et al., 2009; <lb/>Wang et al., 2013), as platelet aggregation, tryptase inhib-<lb/>itors (Krysko et al., 2013; Tetsuhashi et al., 2010), anti-<lb/>inflammatory and immunomodulatory prototypes (Leite <lb/>et al., 2014), hypolipidemic activity (El-Zahabi et al., 2012), <lb/>antiangiogenic activity (Nagarajan et al., 2013), and HDAC&apos;s <lb/>inhibitors (Lee et al., 2007; Shinji et al., 2005, 2006). <lb/></body>

New acetamides <lb/>3(a-c) and 4(a-c) were synthesized and characterized as precursors for novel N-<lb/>aminophalimides 5(a-c) and 6(a-c). Structures of 4a, 5(a-b), and 6(a-b) were <lb/>confirmed by single crystal X-ray. Docking studies identified compounds with <lb/>favorable Gibbs free energy values for binding to histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), <lb/>an enzyme targeted for anticancer drug development. These compounds bound <lb/>to both the orthosteric and allosteric pockets of HDAC8, similar to Trichostatin A <lb/>(TSA), an HDAC8 inhibitor. 6(a-c) contain hydroxyacetamide moiety as a zinc-<lb/>binding group, a phthalimide moiety as a capping group, and aminoacetamide <lb/>moiety as a linker group, which are important for ligand-receptor binding. ΔG <lb/>values indicated that compounds 5b, 6b, and 6c had higher affinity for HDAC8 in <lb/>the allosteric pocket compared to TSA. In vitro evaluation of inhibitory activities <lb/>on HDAC8 revealed that compounds 3(a-c) and 5(a-c) showed similar inhibitory <lb/>effects (IC 50 ) ranging from 0.445 to 0.751 μM. Compounds 6(a-c) showed better <lb/>affinity, with 6a (IC 50 = 28 nM) and 6b (IC 50 = 0.18 μM) showing potent inhibitory <lb/>effects slightly lower than TSA (IC 50 = 26 nM). These findings suggest that the <lb/>studied compounds hold promise as potential candidates for further biological <lb/>investigations. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>acetamides, docking, HDAC8, synthesis of N-aminophalimides, α-amino acids <lb/>This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided <lb/>the original work is properly cited. <lb/>© 2023 The Authors.

			<body>The N-aminophthalimides having an amino group <lb/>bonded to phthalimide moiety have been used to the syn-<lb/>thesis of aziridines, sulfonamides, and hydrazine substituted <lb/>(Bibian et al., 2009; Brosse et al., 2002, 2003; Felten et al., 2008; <lb/>Wang et al., 2018). Also, they have shown biological activities <lb/>like antimicrobial, anticonvulsants, anti-inflammatory, car-<lb/>bonic anhydrase II/IX inhibitor, and chemosensors (Abdel-<lb/>Aziza et al., 2019; Al-Salahi et al., 2010; El-Helby et al., 2017; <lb/>Fakhr et al., 2008; Joo et al., 2017). <lb/>On the other hand, cancer remains one of the lead-<lb/>ing causes of death worldwide (Chakrabarti et al., 2016; <lb/>Falkenberg &amp; Johnstone, 2014; Harrison &amp; Dexter, 2013; <lb/>Kazantsev &amp; Thompson, 2008; Minucci &amp; Pelicci, 2006; <lb/>Nayab et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2019), and cancer treat-<lb/>ments include inhibiting the HDACs that are linked to its <lb/>development. The function of the HDACs is to eliminate <lb/>the acetyl groups of the ε-amino groups of the lysine resi-<lb/>dues of the histones that form the chromatin resulting in <lb/>packing of the structure and preventing gene transcrip-<lb/>tion and causing gene silencing, reversibly regulated by <lb/>histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (Gallinari et al., 2007; <lb/>Struhl, 1998). Aberrant HDAC expression result in er-<lb/>roneous cellular functions, its overexpression has been <lb/>observed in different types of cancer, leading to repres-<lb/>sion of genes, as well as tumor suppressor genes (Marks <lb/>et al., 2001; Roche &amp; Bertrand, 2016). The large family <lb/>of HDAC consists of four classes, according to their se-<lb/>quence homologies to yeast and domain organization, <lb/>those that are zinc-dependent or that require zinc ion to <lb/>carry out their catalytic function: Class I (HDAC1-3, 8), <lb/>class II (HDAC4-7, 9 and 10), and class IV (HDAC11), <lb/>those that are NAD + dependent and structurally different <lb/>from other HDACs called sirtuins: class III (Sir 1-7) (Gre-<lb/>goretti et al., 2004). HDAC8 is the most-studied HDAC <lb/>isoform due to its human oncological relevance and it is <lb/>known that the overexpression of HDAC8 has been linked <lb/>with various types of cancer such as pancreas, colon, <lb/>lung, childhood neuroblastoma, and breast (Falkenberg <lb/>&amp; Johnstone, 2014). Knockdown of HDAC8 has shown <lb/>cell antiproliferative activity, apoptosis in T-cell lympho-<lb/>mas, and gastric adenocarcinoma (Balasubramanian <lb/>et al., 2008; Kang et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2007; <lb/>Oehme et al., 2009; Song et al., 2015; West et al., 2014; Wu <lb/>et al., 2013), as well as cell cycle arrest and induction of <lb/>cell differentiation without affecting global histone acetyl-<lb/>ation or cellular HDAC activity (Witt et al., 2009). In ad-<lb/>dition, in order to understand the catalytic mechanism <lb/>of HDAC8, X-ray crystal structures of various inhibitors <lb/>complexed with this enzyme have been studied, thus re-<lb/>vealing in detail insight into their binding modes (Dowling <lb/>et al., 2008; Somoza et al., 2004; Vannini et al., 2004, 2007). <lb/>Besides, molecular docking study has also been a useful <lb/>tool to design and investigate new HDAC8 inhibitors <lb/>(HDAC8i) (Banerjee et al., 2019; Marek et al., 2018; Uba <lb/>et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). In addition, HDAC8 inhib-<lb/>itors have been developed based on the pharmacophoric <lb/>model, these molecules containing a bulky substituent <lb/>such as tetrahydroisoquinoline, pyrazole, methoxyphe-<lb/>nyl, p(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)phenyl, p(azacyclododec-8-ene-<lb/>5,12-dione)phenyl-derived, aromatic sulphide group, <lb/>3,5-CF 3 -phenyl, bulky heteroaromatic group, as a cap-<lb/>ping group (CG), an aromatic group, phenyl group linked <lb/>to hydrazide or triazole, indolyl group, sulfamoyl motif, <lb/>phenylamides, piperazine as a linker (LG), and ortho-<lb/>aryl N-hydroxycinnamides, hydroxamic acid, triazole, <lb/>anilide, disulphide or azetidine-2-one as a zinc-binding <lb/>group (ZBG) among others (Fontana et al., 2022; Huang <lb/>et al., 2012; Ingham et al., 2016; Neelarapu et al., 2011; Su-<lb/>zuki et al., 2012; Taha et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2011; Wang <lb/>&amp; Dymock, 2009; Zhang et al., 2011, 2018). <lb/>On this background, our research has been interesting <lb/>in the synthesis of compounds derived from α-amino acids <lb/>and in researching their biological properties, for instance, <lb/>we have synthesized and carried out docking studies and in <lb/>vitro assays of some 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole derived from <lb/>α-amino acids as channel blockers, Cox-1 and -2 inhibitors, <lb/>effect over HDAC8 activity and expression, and HDACs in-<lb/>hibitors, as well as effect on the K14E6 transgenic mouse <lb/>model (Mancilla et al., 2001; Mancilla-Percino et al., 2010, <lb/>2016; Rodríguez-Uribe et al., 2018, 2020; Santamaria-<lb/>Herrera et al., 2016; Trejo Muñoz et al., 2014). <lb/>Thus, continuing with our studies, in this work, we <lb/>present the synthesis of novel N-aminophalimides 5(a-<lb/>c) and 6(a-c) derived from α-amino acids, which have <lb/>the phthalimide moiety as analogous compounds stud-<lb/>ied as anticancer agents and HDAC inhibitors, as well <lb/>as new 3(a-c), 4(a-c) acetamides as precursors of N-<lb/>aminophalimides. The compounds under study were se-<lb/>lected to their synthesis from molecular docking results of <lb/>acetamides y N-aminophalimides derived of 20 α-amino <lb/>acids against HDAC8. All compounds synthetized in this <lb/>work were characterized by nuclear magnetic and high-<lb/>resolution mass spectrometry, and confirmation of the <lb/>structures of 4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b by X-ray diffraction. <lb/>Furthermore, evaluation of the inhibitory activity of 3(a-<lb/>c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c) on HDAC8 enzyme is reported. <lb/>2 | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>2.1 | General procedures and materials <lb/>All solvents and chemicals were used as bought without <lb/>further purification. HDAC8 Inhibitor Screening kit was <lb/>bought from Sigma Aldrich Co® Catalog Number EPI007. <lb/> 1 <lb/>H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol 500 ECA <lb/></body>

CCDC-1969858 (4a), <lb/>-1969859 (5a), -1969860 (5b), -1969861 (6a), and -1969862 <lb/>(6b), they are shown in supplementary crystallographic <lb/>(Appendix S1). <lb/>2.4 | Computational methodology <lb/>Molecular docking of the acetamides and TSA (reference <lb/>compound) was performed on the X-ray crystal struc-<lb/>ture of human HDAC8 enzyme, which was retrieved <lb/>from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1T64) (Somoza <lb/>et al., 2004; Vannini et al., 2004). The crystal structure was <lb/>optimized by removing the water and the co-crystallized <lb/>ligands using Discovery Studio Visualizer v19.1.0.18287 <lb/>(Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, 2019), whereas hydrogen <lb/>atoms were added using AutoDockTools-1.5.6. All the <lb/>compounds were drawn using GaussView 5.0.8 and were <lb/>geometrically optimized by density functional theory <lb/>calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level using Gaussian <lb/>09W software (Frisch et al., 2013). Docking calculations <lb/>were conducted using AutoDock 4.2.6® software (Mor-<lb/>ris et al., 2009). The grid box covered the entire volume <lb/>of the HDAC8 (126 Å × 126 Å × 126 Å dimensions) with a <lb/>grid spacing of 0.375 Å. The main Lamarckian Genetic Al-<lb/>gorithm (Morris et al., 2009) parameters were set to 100 <lb/>runs, a population size of 100, and a maximum number <lb/>of 1 × 10 7 energy evaluation. The co-crystallized TSA was <lb/>re-docked on HDAC8 to valid the docking protocol. The <lb/>re-docked was evaluated by calculation of root stand-<lb/>ard deviation (RMSD) using Discovery Studio Visualizer <lb/>v19.1.0.18287 (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, 2019). Dock-<lb/>ing poses of the target compounds and TSA were analyzed <lb/>based on the best energy and were visualized using Dis-<lb/>covery studio 3.5 software v19.1.0.18287 (Dassault Sys-<lb/>tèmes BIOVIA, 2019). <lb/>2.5 | HDAC8 inhibition assay <lb/>The inhibitory activity of 3(a-c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c) on <lb/>HDAC8 was evaluated by detection of lysyl deacety-<lb/>lase activity of the recombinant human HDAC8, using <lb/>HDAC8 Fluorometric Drug Discovery Kit according to <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions (Sigma Aldrich Co® Catalog <lb/>No EPI007). The stock solutions of the compounds and <lb/>TSA (inhibitor control) were prepared in DMSO and di-<lb/>luted in assay buffer to reach the final concentration in <lb/>the range of 0.25 nM-100 μM. The final concentration of <lb/>DMSO was &lt;10% and did not affect the activity of the as-<lb/>says. The assays were performed by preincubating the en-<lb/>zyme with the test compounds, including TSA, at 37°C for <lb/>10 min. Then, the substrate was added, and the mixture <lb/>was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. After, 10 μL of the devel-<lb/>oper were added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C <lb/>for 5 min. The fluorescence signal was measured using a <lb/>fluorescence plate reader (Thermo Scientific Fluoroskan <lb/>Ascent FL) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 <lb/>and 485 nm, respectively. All experiments were performed <lb/>in triplicate. The IC 50 values were calculated using non-<lb/>linear regression dose-response fit in (Prism GraphPad <lb/>Software). <lb/>3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>3.1 | Chemistry <lb/>The synthetic route leading to the formation of the target <lb/>compounds 3(a-c), 4(a-c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c) is outlined <lb/>in Scheme 1. Compound 2, which was raw material, was <lb/>obtained by the reaction of Bromo acetic acid 1 with tert-<lb/>butanol in the presence of NaH. Compound 2 was con-<lb/>verted by a coupling reaction to tert-butoxyacetamides <lb/>methyl ester 3(a-c) with corresponding α-amino methyl <lb/>ester hydrochloride (a, b, and c: Gly, Phe, and Trp derived, <lb/>respectively), using T3P® in DCM or ACN depending on <lb/>their solubility. Compounds 3(a-c) were then converted <lb/>into the corresponding tert-butoxyacetamides 4(a-c) after <lb/>alkaline hydrolysis using potassium hydroxide in aqueous <lb/>methanol. Compounds 5(a-c) were obtained through the <lb/>coupling between N-aminophthalimide and correspond-<lb/>ing 4(a-c), using HATU as coupling reagent with stir-<lb/>ring at room temperature overnight. Finally, 6(a-c) were <lb/>obtained by the deprotection of the hydroxyl group with <lb/>Amberlite® IR120 hydrogen form under methanol reflux <lb/>(Mallesha et al., 2012). <lb/>3.2 | Spectroscopy <lb/>All compounds were characterized by spectroscopic meth-<lb/>ods of 1 H, 13 C NMR (Spectra are given in Appendix S1), <lb/>Infrared and spectrometry of HRMS (Spectra are given <lb/>in Appendix S1). Besides, suitable crystals of compounds <lb/>4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b were obtained for X-ray diffraction, <lb/>which confirmed their structures (X-ray data are given in <lb/>SI). All data for each compound are given in the materials <lb/>and methods section. <lb/>1 <lb/>H NMR spectra of compounds 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b were <lb/>recorded in CDCl 3 , while 3c and 4c in DMSO-d6. The <lb/>spectra of 3(a-c) showed a singlet signal for methoxy and <lb/>tert-butoxy protons in the range of 3.62-3.77 and 1.06-<lb/>1.25 ppm, respectively. H-2 of 3a displayed a doublet at <lb/>4.09 ppm, and that of 3b and 3c showed a quartet at 4.89 <lb/>and 4.61 ppm, respectively. The NH-3 of 3a exhibited a <lb/></body>

Aromatic carbons C-9 to C-11 and carbonyl car-<lb/>bons C-8 of the phthalimide moiety displayed the signals <lb/>in the range of 123.5-135.9 ppm and 164.7-165.6 ppm, re-<lb/>spectively. The high-resolution mass spectra of the target <lb/>compounds showed the ion of the protonated molecules <lb/>[M + H] + , which agreed with their molecular formula, the <lb/>data are given in the experimental section. <lb/>3.3 | X-ray structures <lb/>Suitable crystals of 4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b were obtained <lb/>for X-ray analysis, an ORTEP view, and crystallographic <lb/>numbering are given in the Figures 1-3. Compound 4a, <lb/>5a, 6a, and 6b crystallized with four molecules in the <lb/>unit cell, while 5b crystallized with two molecules to-<lb/>gether with two chloroform molecules, which was used <lb/>to crystallize. In general, all bond distances are within <lb/>the values expected (Bondi, 1964; Zamudio Rivera <lb/>et al., 1999); bond lengths selected are summarized in <lb/>Tables 1-3. <lb/>The molecules in the crystal structure exhibit intra-<lb/>molecular hydrogen bonding between oxygen of alkoxy <lb/>group and hydrogen of NH of the amide moiety as fol-<lb/>lows: O 2 …H 1 2.33, O 5 …H 03 2.19, O 5 …H 03 2.16 for 4a, <lb/>5a, and 5b, respectively. Molecules 6a and 6b show the <lb/>following intermolecular interaction H 03 …O 5 2.22, and <lb/>O 5 …H 03 2.20 Å, respectively. Besides, 4a exhibit the in-<lb/>termolecular interaction H 3 …O 4 2.22 Å of the carboxylic <lb/>group. Therefore, these molecules in the crystal structure <lb/>show intermolecular hydrogen bonding as follows: O 1 … <lb/>H 3 1.81 Å for 4a, H 02 …O 4 1.88, H 03 …O 2 2.50 and H 10B …O 2 <lb/>2.630 Å for 5a, O 4 …H 02 2.08 Å for 5b, H02…O4 1.89, 03… <lb/>H05 2.01, H03…01 2.24 Å for 6a, and H 02 …O 4 1.87, H 03 …O 1 <lb/>2.65, H 05 …O 3 1.874 for 6b, which are significantly shorter <lb/>than the sum of the van der Waals radii of oxygen and <lb/>hydrogen (2.70 Å) (Bondi, 1964). <lb/>In addition, the torsion angles values indicate the pla-<lb/>narity in acetamide moiety in these crystal structures as <lb/>179 (4) o (O 1 -C 3 -N 1 -H 1 ) and 1 (4) o (C 4 -C 3 -N 1 -H 1 ) for 4a, <lb/>180 (2) o (O 4 -C 11 -N 3 -H 03 ) and 0 (2) o (C 12 -C 11 -N 3 -H 03 ) for <lb/>5a, -173 (3) o (O 4 -C 11 -N 3 -H 03 ) for 5b, 176 (1) o (O 4 -C 11 -<lb/>N 3 -H 03 ), -4 (1) o (C 12 -C 11 -N 3 -H 03 ) and -175(2) o (O 3 -<lb/>C 9 -N 2 -H0 2 ) for 6a, and 176 (2) o (O 4 -C 11 -N 3 -H 03 ) and <lb/>-171(2) o (O 3 -C 9 -N 2 -H 02 ) for 6b. <lb/>4 | MOLECULAR DOCKING <lb/>STUDY <lb/>X-ray structures of various HDAC8-inhibitor complexes <lb/>have been described, including TSA among other (Brun-<lb/>steiner &amp; Petukhov, 2012), and considerable structural <lb/>differences were found in the protein surface in the vicin-<lb/>ity of the aperture of the active site, depending on which <lb/>inhibitor is bonded (Estiu et al., 2010), these changes de-<lb/>rived from the presence of two deep pockets one denoted <lb/>as the orthosteric pocket and the second close to the first <lb/>denoted as the allosteric pocket, where Trp141, Phe152, <lb/>and Tyr306 form the wall between both cavities (Estiu <lb/>et al., 2010). In particular, the crystal structure of HDAC8-<lb/>TSA complex (PDB ID: 1T64) (Somoza et al., 2004), shows <lb/>that TSA binds at two pockets, in this sense, it has been <lb/>considered as competitive inhibitor because it is binding <lb/>at catalytic pocket and noncompetitive inhibitor since <lb/>is noncatalytic binding pocket (Su et al., 2008). The or-<lb/>thosteric that is the active site is described as a long and <lb/>narrow tunnel constituted for the amino acids residues <lb/>His142, His143, Gly151, Phe152, His180, Phe208, Met274, <lb/>and Tyr306 (Somoza et al., 2004; Vannini et al., 2004), at <lb/>the bottom of this tunnel, the catalytic site is found, which <lb/>is formed by Zn 2+ ion and the catalytic triad of His142, <lb/>His143, and Tyr306n (Gantt et al., 2016). One of the char-<lb/>acteristics in HDAC8 is loop L1, which is formed by seven <lb/>amino acid residues (Ser30, Leu31, Ala32, Lys33, Ile34, <lb/>Pro35, and Lys36) (Maolanon et al., 2016), is highly flex-<lb/>ible and found toward the proximity of the active site <lb/>and can undergo conformational changes for substrates <lb/>binding. <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Molecular structure of C 8 H 15 NO 4 , and <lb/>crystallographic numbering scheme of 4a. <lb/></body>

			<body>showed that most of the compounds binding in both or-<lb/>thosteric and allosteric site of the enzyme, as it has been <lb/>observed for TSA (Docking data are given in SI). Based <lb/>on the results, compounds 3(a-c), 4(a-t), 5(a-t), and <lb/>6(a-t) were selected for analysis of the binding modes <lb/>on the X-ray structure of HDAC8 (PDB ID: 1T64). The <lb/>docking protocol was confirmed through the re-docking <lb/>of the co-crystallized TSA within the HDAC8 structure. <lb/>It showed that the inhibitor bound into both pockets <lb/>of the enzyme providing an RMSD value of 0.9304 and <lb/>1.3509 Å. Therefore, the docking protocol was reliable <lb/>for the analysis of the binding modes of the target com-<lb/>pounds with HDAC8. <lb/>The Gibbs free energies (ΔG, kcal/mol), along with <lb/>the corresponding dissociation constants (K d , μM) val-<lb/>ues were obtained for the four series HDAC8-ligands <lb/>complexes in each pocket, showing all these compounds <lb/>more affinity at the allosteric pocket than in orthosteric <lb/>pocket, except 5c, and 4a that did not show affinity to <lb/>orthosteric site. Furthermore, compounds 5b, 6b, and 6c <lb/>inhibited more affinity than TSA. The data are summa-<lb/>rized in Table 4. <lb/>The study of binding modes of 3(a-c), 4(a-c), 5(a-<lb/>c), and 6(a-c) and TSA with amino acid residues of both <lb/>pockets of HDAC8 was based on the analysis of the type <lb/>of interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions <lb/>coordination bonds, π-sulfur, π-lone pairs, and π-cation <lb/>interactions, where the analysis of the distances were <lb/>considered as &lt;4 Å for hydrogen bonds and &lt;6 Å for hy-<lb/>drophobic interactions, (Brylinski, 2018; Copeland, 2000) <lb/>between heteroatoms, carbons, or protons coupled to het-<lb/>eroatoms of all target acetamides to atoms of amino acids <lb/>residues of HDAC8. The docking results showed that all <lb/>the binding interactions depended on the conformations <lb/>and functional groups of the acetamides. <lb/>4.1 | Binding modes of compounds 3(a-c) <lb/>with HDAC8 <lb/>Acetamides 3(a-c) showed interactions in the orthosteric <lb/>site of HDAC8, in which binding modes depended on <lb/>the orientation of the molecules based on the substitute <lb/>in position three.

			<body>ester moiety of 3a showed a coordination bond to Zn 2+ at <lb/>2.22 Å, by hydrogen bonds with the proton of OH (side <lb/>chain) of Tyr306 (2.23 Å) and with the NH (backbone) <lb/>of Gly304 (2.51 Å). A carbon atom from the tert-butoxy <lb/>moiety showed hydrophobic binds alkyl-π (side chain) of <lb/>Phe208 (3.71 Å) and Phe152 (4.23 Å). Acetamides 3b and <lb/>3c, which have the phenyl and indole groups at position <lb/>three, respectively, showed that both groups interacted <lb/>with the amino acid residues of the surface of the enzyme <lb/>in the vicinity of the opening of the active site, exhibiting <lb/>different orientation, and bind modes to that observed for <lb/>3a, which does not have a substituent at position three. <lb/>This can be attributed to the different conformations <lb/>adopted by the three acetamides in the pocket. <lb/>Thus, the oxygen atom of tert-butoxy group of 3b exhib-<lb/>ited a hydrogen bond with the proton of NH (backbone) <lb/>of Phe208 at 2.12 Å, phenyl group exhibited π-π T-shaped <lb/>interaction with Phe152 at 4.89 Å, and π-lone pair interac-<lb/>tion (side chain) with His180 at 4.09 Å. Hydrogens, NH-3 <lb/>and NH of indole group of 3c showed hydrogen bonds <lb/>with the oxygen of carbonyl (backbone) of Gly206 (1.99 Å) <lb/>and carbonyl (side chain) of Asp101 (2.09 Å), respectively; <lb/>indole exhibited π-π stacking interactions with Phe208 at <lb/>3.82 and 3.94 Å, and π-sulfur interaction with Met274 at <lb/>5.18 Å. The results show that compounds 3(a-c) bonded <lb/>to the residues of the active site of HDAC8, and 3a ad-<lb/>ditionally bonded to zinc ion, suggesting it bonded in a <lb/>competitive manner. Compounds 3b and 3c also showed <lb/>interactions with the amino acid residues that do not be-<lb/>long to the active site, which are in the L8 loop as Tyr306, <lb/>the L5 loop as Phe 208, and Asp101 residue is strictly con-<lb/>served in the L2 loop of all class I and class II HDAC&apos;s and <lb/>has been established that is important for the substrate <lb/>recognition (Dowling et al., 2008; Estiu et al., 2010; Van-<lb/>nini et al., 2007). The results showed that the ester group <lb/>of 3a oriented toward the catalytic site as the hydroxamic <lb/>group of TSA. Also, acetamides and inhibitor showed in-<lb/>teractions with the same amino residues of the active site <lb/>Phe152, Phe208, Gly304, Met274, and Tyr306. Therefore, <lb/>acetamides 3(a-c) may be considered as possible HDAC8 <lb/>inhibitors. <lb/>Acetamides 3(a-c) exhibited different conformations <lb/>between them at the allosteric site of HDAC8, therefore <lb/>displayed the following binds, 3a showed four hydrogen <lb/>bonds, NH-3 with C=O (backbone) of Cys28 at 2.79 Å, <lb/>with C=O (side chain) of Asp29 at 2.21 Å and the oxygen <lb/>atom of the C=O-4 with NH 2 of guanidine group (side <lb/>chain) of Arg37 at 1.88 Å. A carbon atom from tert-butoxy <lb/>moiety showed alkyl-π interaction with Tyr306 at 5.05 Å. <lb/>Compound 3b showed two hydrogen bonds, the oxygen <lb/>atom of C=O-1 with NH (backbone) of Arg37 at 2.15 Å <lb/>and NH-3 with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 at 2.50 Å, and <lb/>the phenyl group exhibited π-π T-shaped interaction with <lb/>Tyr 306 at 5.03 Å. Indole moiety of 3c showed π-alkyl in-<lb/>teraction with C (side chain) of Arg37 at 4.97 Å and π-<lb/>guanidine group protonated interaction (side chain) at <lb/>4.45 Å. NH of indole moiety exhibited a hydrogen bond <lb/>with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 at 1.88 Å, also indole group <lb/>showed π-π stacked interaction with Trp141 at 4.38 Å. <lb/>Among the common binding of these compounds are to <lb/>Arg37 through C=O-4 and C=O-1 of 3a and 3b, respec-<lb/>tively, and indole group of 3c, acetamides 3a and 3d bind <lb/>to Tyr306 through tert-butoxy moiety and phenyl moiety, <lb/>respectively; 3b and 3c bind to Tyr111 by NH-3 and NH <lb/>of indole moiety, (Figure 4). These results revealed that <lb/>both acetamides and TSA bind to the amino acid residues <lb/>Arg37, Tyr111, and Ser138 in the allosteric site of HDAC8, <lb/>but different binding types depending on their conforma-<lb/>tion adopted at the site. <lb/>4.2 | Binding modes of compounds 4(a-c) <lb/>with HDAC8 <lb/>Compounds 4(a-c), which have a carboxylic group instead <lb/>of the ester group of their precursors 3(a-c), showed dif-<lb/>ferent orientations and binding types in the orthosteric <lb/>site in comparison with those of 3(a-c), except 4a that did <lb/>not show interactions in this pocket. Thus, the tert-butoxy <lb/>group of 4b and 4c orient toward the inside of the tunnel, <lb/>while the groups of 3b and 3c oriented inside were phe-<lb/>nyl and indole, respectively. Two carbon atoms of the tert-<lb/>butoxy moiety of 4b exhibited alkyl-π interactions with <lb/>side chains of His143, Phe152, and His180 at 3.89, 4.44, <lb/>and 4.12 Å, respectively, and two carbon atoms of the tert-<lb/>butoxy group of 4c displayed alkyl-π interactions with the <lb/>side chain of Phe152 (4.20, 4.60 Å), His180 (4.44 Å), Tyr306 <lb/>(4.18 Å), and Met274 at (4.59 Å). C=O-1 of 4b and 4c bind <lb/>by a hydrogen bond to NH (backbone) of Phe208 at 1.88 <lb/>and 1.79 Å, respectively. The hydrogen atom of the carbox-<lb/>ylic acid of 4b exhibited hydrogen bond with N (side chain) <lb/>of His180 at 2.24 Å, NH-3 of 4b and 4c displayed hydrogen <lb/>bonds with N (side chain) of His180 at 2.72 and 2.14 Å, re-<lb/>spectively. C-5 of 4c exhibited alkyl-π interaction with the <lb/>side chain of Phe208 at 3.70 Å. NH of indole moiety of 4c <lb/>bind by a hydrogen bond to C=O (backbone) of Pro273 at <lb/>2.01 Å, although it does not belong to active site residues, <lb/>it is joined to Met274, and indole moiety exhibited bind <lb/>π-alkyl interaction with C (side chain) of Met274 at 4.17 Å. <lb/>These data showed that 4b and 4c interacted to the amino <lb/>acid residues of the active site of HDAC8 and that carbox-<lb/>ylic acid moiety contributed to the orientation of the mole-<lb/>cules where tert-butoxy moiety, although voluminous, was <lb/>oriented in the tunnel.

			<body>showed binding with the same amino residues of the ac-<lb/>tive site Phe152, Phe208, Met274, and Tyr306, where 4c <lb/>displayed more bindings.

			<body>5c conformation let more binding with amino acid resi-<lb/>dues of the surface pocket. <lb/>4.4 | Binding modes of compounds 6(a-c) <lb/>with HDAC8 <lb/>It is known that several classes of small molecule have <lb/>been recognized as HDAC inhibitors, most of these are <lb/>hydroxamic acid derivatives, exemplified by suberoylani-<lb/>lide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), where hydroxamate moiety <lb/>chelate the zinc ion in the active site. While hydroxamic <lb/>acid group is responsible for various potent inhibitors, <lb/>they usually have many problems associated with their <lb/>use such as low oral availability, poor in vivo stability, and <lb/>undesirable side effects. Based on the above, research on <lb/>this topic was focused on the replacement of hydroxam-<lb/>ate by non-hydroxamate groups to find potent molecules <lb/>as inhibitors of HDACs, thus, several suberoylanilide <lb/>hydroxamic acid (SAHA)-based compounds have been <lb/>synthesized containing sulfonamide, sulfone, aminoca-<lb/>tetamide, hydroxyacetamine, and mercaptoacetamide as <lb/>ZBG. The kinetic enzyme assays and molecular modeling <lb/>suggested that compounds with mercaptoacetamide moi-<lb/>ety interacts with the zinc in the active site of HDACs (Su-<lb/>zuki et al., 2005; Wang &amp; Dymock, 2009). <lb/>In this context, compounds 6(a-c) are attractive <lb/>because having a hydroxyacetamide moiety as a zinc-<lb/>binding group (ZBG), a phthalimide moiety as a capping <lb/>group, and aminoacetamide moiety as a linker group, <lb/>which are important in the ligand-receptor binding <lb/>(Marks et al., 2003; Figure 7). The binding modes of these <lb/>compounds with HDAC8 depend on their conformations <lb/>led to different orientations on each site.

			<body>of 6a was orient toward the inner of the orthosteric site, <lb/>where the oxygen of C=O-4 showed binding at zinc ion <lb/>at 2.05 Å. Also, 6a exhibited hydrogen bonds with the <lb/>enzyme as follows, hydrogen of NH-3 with oxygen atom <lb/>(backbone) of Gly151 at 2.5 Å, oxygen of C=O-4 with OH <lb/>(side chain) of Tyr306 at 2.22 Å, hydrogen of NH with oxy-<lb/>gen atom (backbone) of Gly304 at 2.61 Å, and hydrogen of <lb/>OH group bind to an oxygen atom (side chain) of Asp178 <lb/>at 2.10 Å. Phthalimide moiety showed π-π stacking inter-<lb/>actions with Phe208 at 3.83 and 4.44 Å. Due to 6a binding <lb/>to zinc ion and Asp178, Phe208, and Tyr306 just like TSA, <lb/>it may be promising as an HDAC8 inhibitor, and a candi-<lb/>date for additional studies. <lb/>Compounds 6b and 6c were oriented at the active <lb/>site in a different way than 6a because they had different <lb/>conformations. Although these compounds did not show <lb/>interaction with the zinc ion, they showed binding inter-<lb/>actions with the amino acid residues of the active site. <lb/>Compound 6b displayed interactions by hydrogen bonds <lb/>as follows, hydrogen of NH-3 and that of hydroxyl group <lb/>interacted with oxygen (side chain) of Asp101 at 2.08 and <lb/>1.97 Å, respectively, the oxygen atom of C=O-8 with NH <lb/>(backbone) of Phe208 at 1.97 Å. The aromatic moiety of <lb/>phthalimide of 6b exhibited π-π T-shaped interaction <lb/>whit (side chain) of His180 at 5.67 Å and π-alkyl with <lb/>(side chain) of Met274 at 4.38 and 4.60 Å. Compound 6c <lb/>exhibited interactions by hydrogen bonds as follows: Oxy-<lb/>gen atom of C=O-4 with the hydrogen of NH (backbone) <lb/>of Phe208 at 1.69 Å, hydrogen of OH group with oxygen <lb/>(side chain) of Gly206 at 1.77 Å, NH-6 with S (side chain) <lb/>of Met274 at 2.98 Å, and the oxygen atom of C=O-8 with <lb/>NH (side chain) Lys202 at 2.20 Å. The phthalimide moiety <lb/>showed π-alkyl interaction with (side chain) of Met274 at <lb/>5.02 Å, indole moiety showed the π-π T-shaped interac-<lb/>tions with Phe152 (4.78 Å) and His180 (4.31 Å), and the <lb/>π-π stacked with Phe208 at 4.13 and 4.86 Å. As it is men-<lb/>tioned above, although 6b and 6c did not interact with <lb/>zinc ion, they showed binding interactions with the amino <lb/>acid residues of the active site Phe208 and Met274 as well <lb/>as TSA; therefore, these compounds could be considered <lb/>for further studies, (Figure 5). Compounds 6(a-c) in the <lb/>allosteric site showed hydrogen bonds interactions of the <lb/>oxygen atoms of C=O-1 and C=O-4 of 6a with guanidine <lb/>moiety (side chain) of Arg37 at 2.66 and 2.49 Å, respec-<lb/>tively, whereas only oxygen atom of C=O-4 of 6b bind to <lb/>Arg37 at 1.83 Å, NH-6 of 6a and 6b with oxygen (back-<lb/>bone) of Pro35 at 1.78 and 2.18 Å, respectively, oxygen of <lb/>OH group of 6a with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 and hy-<lb/>drogen of HO with of 6a (side chain) of Ser138 at 1.80 and <lb/>2.10 Å, hydrogen of OH group of 6b with oxygen (back-<lb/>bone) of Ser138 at 1.66 Å, and hydrogen of OH group of 6c <lb/>whit OH (side chain) of Tyr111 and oxygen (backbone) of <lb/>Phe152 at 1.95 and 2.07 Å. <lb/>The phthalimide moiety displayed the following in-<lb/>teractions: For that of 6a π-alkyl with CH 2 (side chain) <lb/>of Pro35 (4.13 Å), CH 2 (side chain) of Arg37 (5.15 Å), and <lb/>π-π T-shaped (side chain) of Phe152 at 4.82 Å, for 6b and <lb/>6c a π-π T-shaped with the side chain of Tyr306 at 4.54 <lb/>and 4.53 Å, respectively. Phenyl moiety of 6b displayed <lb/>π-π stacking interaction with the side chain of Tyr111 at <lb/>4.61 Å. The hydrogen of NH of indole moiety of 6c showed <lb/>a hydrogen bond with oxygen (backbone) of Pro35 at <lb/>1.75 Å, and the indole moiety exhibited π-π T-shaped in-<lb/>teraction with (side chain) of Tyr111 at 5.91 (Figure 8). <lb/>The results showed that phthalimide moiety of 6a bound <lb/>with Ile34, Pro35, and Phe152, and that of 6b and 6c with <lb/>Tyr306, while phenyl moiety of TSA bind with Pro35 and <lb/>Phe152. The hydroxy group of these compounds bind with <lb/>Tyr111 (6a, 6c), Ser138 (6a, 6b), and Phe152 (6c), while <lb/>the hydroxamic moiety of TSA did not display interaction <lb/>in this pocket, but the inhibitor showed interactions with <lb/>the same amino acid residues by binding mode different to <lb/>those of the target compounds. Thus, compounds 6(a-c) <lb/>are promising for further studies. <lb/>5 | HDAC8 INHIBITORY ASSAY <lb/>It is known that several drugs have been identified to in-<lb/>hibit class I and/or class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), <lb/>of which Trichostatin A (TSA) is one of the well-known <lb/>HDAC inhibitors. However, little is known about the <lb/>effect of TSA on HDAC8, of which is the inhibition of <lb/>proliferation of Molt-4 cells which express HDAC8 (Jing <lb/>et al., 2006). Another study has been conducted to explore <lb/>whether the function of HDACs was modulated by TSA at <lb/>concentrations that block cancer cell viability by enzyme <lb/>activity assays in purified systems and in cell extracts. <lb/>TSA&apos;s effective killing dose of 400 nM fully inhibited <lb/>HDAC1 and HDAC2, and HDAC8 only partly activity, <lb/>however, 5 mM TSA fully eliminated its activity (Chang <lb/>et al., 2012). <lb/>The inhibitory activity of compounds 3(a-c), 5(a-c), <lb/>and 6(a-c) on HDAC8 was evaluated based on the results <lb/>obtained from the docking study because they presented <lb/>better values of ΔG and K d than 4(a-c), and even 4a did <lb/>not present interactions in the orthosteric site of HDAC8. <lb/>The in vitro inhibitory activity of target acetamides was <lb/>evaluated with the HDAC8 Fluorometric Drug Discovery <lb/>Kit, TSA as a control inhibitor included in the Kit. Table 5 <lb/>shows the IC 50 values, although 5(a-c) showed better <lb/>values of ΔG and K d from the docking study than 3(a-c), <lb/>both series exhibited almost the same inhibitory effect <lb/>in the range of 0.751-0.445 μM. Regarding compounds <lb/>6(a-c), that displayed better affinity in docking, 6a (IC 50 <lb/>of 28 nM) and 6b (IC 50 = 0.18 μM) revealed the best effect <lb/></body>

			<body>inhibitory effect on HDAC8, except for 6c. Compound 6a <lb/>showed the best IC 50 slightly above the TSA. <lb/>6 | CONCLUSION <lb/>Twelve new acetamides and novel N-aminophalimides <lb/>derived from α-amino acids were selected for their syn-<lb/>thesis from docking study and were obtained in good <lb/>yields; they were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR, infra-<lb/>red, HRMS, and structures of 4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b were <lb/>confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The molecular dock-<lb/>ing results showed that all compounds, except 4a binds <lb/>in both pockets, and their orientation within HDAC8 <lb/>depended on the conformation in each site. In general, <lb/>acetamides without and with phthalimide moiety showed <lb/>interactions with the amino acid residues of the active site <lb/>and allosteric site, where binding modes were similar or <lb/>different to those displayed for TSA. Although only 3a and <lb/>6a displayed interaction with the Zn, all target acetamides <lb/>studied may be considered for further studies. According <lb/>to the inhibition assays, all the evaluated acetamides ex-<lb/>hibited inhibitory activity on HDAC8. Among them, 6a <lb/>(IC 50 = 28 nM) and 6b showed better enzymatic inhibitory, <lb/>where 6a showed the greatest effect, slightly less than <lb/>TSA (IC 50 = 26 nM). These results suggested that the tar-<lb/>get acetamides and N-aminophalimides may be promising <lb/>anticancer agents for further biological studies. <lb/></body>
