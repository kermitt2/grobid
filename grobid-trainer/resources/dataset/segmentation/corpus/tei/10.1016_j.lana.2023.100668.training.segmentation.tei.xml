			<body>Epitope Mapping of Human Polyclonal <lb/>Antibodies to the fHbp Antigen of a Neisseria <lb/>Meningitidis Vaccine by Hydrogen-Deuterium <lb/>Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) <lb/>Laura R. Grauslund 1,2 , Susanne Ständer 1,2 , Daniele Veggi 2 , Emanuele Andreano 3 , <lb/>Kasper D. Rand 1,* , and Nathalie Norais 2,* <lb/>Antigen-antibody interactions play a key role in the im-<lb/>mune response post vaccination and the mechanism of <lb/>action of antibody-based biopharmaceuticals. 4CMenB is <lb/>a multicomponent vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis <lb/>serogroup B in which factor H binding protein (fHbp) is one <lb/>of the key antigens. In this study, we use hydrogen/ <lb/>deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to <lb/>identify epitopes in fHbp recognized by polyclonal anti-<lb/>bodies (pAb) from two human donors (HDs) vaccinated <lb/>with 4CMenB. Our HDX-MS data reveal several epitopes <lb/>recognized by the complex mixture of human pAb. <lb/>Furthermore, we show that the pAb from the two HDs <lb/>recognize the same epitope regions. Epitope mapping of <lb/>total pAb and purified fHbp-specific pAb from the same <lb/>HD reveals that the two antibody samples recognize the <lb/>same main epitopes, showing that HDX-MS based epitope <lb/>mapping can, in this case at least, be performed directly <lb/>using total IgG pAb samples that have not undergone Ab-<lb/>selective purification. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) <lb/>were previously produced from B-cell repertoire se-<lb/>quences from one of the HDs and used for epitope map-<lb/>ping of fHbp with HDX-MS. The epitopes identified for the <lb/>pAb from the same HD in this study, overlap with the <lb/>epitopes recognized by the two individual mAbs. Overall, <lb/>HDX-MS epitope mapping appears highly suitable for <lb/>simultaneous identification of epitopes recognized by pAb <lb/>from human donors and to thus both guide vaccine <lb/>development and study basic human immunity to patho-<lb/>gens, including viruses. <lb/>Antigen-antibody interactions are central to pathogen im-<lb/>munity. Antibodies induce immune responses through bind-<lb/>ing to linear or conformational epitopes on their target <lb/>antigen. Identification of these epitopes is crucial for the <lb/>fundamental understanding of immune responses as well as <lb/>for development of therapeutic antibodies and efficient vac-<lb/>cine antigens. Various biochemical techniques can be used to <lb/>identify linear or conformational epitopes, like protein chip, <lb/>etc (1, 2). However, especially identification of conformational <lb/>or discontinuous epitopes can be challenging with such <lb/>routine biochemical methods although it is known that <lb/>structure can be important for immunogenicity (3). Hydrogen-<lb/>deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a sen-<lb/>sitive analytical technique to probe the impact of binding <lb/>between proteins and has therefore emerged as a useful and <lb/>very sensitive technique for epitope mapping of conforma-<lb/>tional epitopes (4). Most HDX-MS epitope mapping studies <lb/>are focused on the complex formed by an antigen and a <lb/>monoclonal antibody (mAb) or the antigen-binding fragment <lb/>(Fab) (5, 6). Such studies reveal detailed structural information <lb/>about the epitopes recognized by individual mAbs, but <lb/>require isolation of B cells, gene sequencing and recombinant <lb/>production and purification of each antibody of interest which <lb/>is a time-consuming process. The B cells used for <lb/>sequencing are most often isolated from peripheral blood <lb/>(PB), which is estimated to account for only 2% of the total <lb/>population of B cells (7, 8). The number of plasma cells, the <lb/>antibody-secreting B cells, in PB depends on the immune <lb/>status of the individual (9). Studies have shown that 1 week <lb/>after vaccination, the antigen-specific plasma cells constitute <lb/>around 30% of the total population of plasma cells in PB (10, <lb/>11). Furthermore, out of the 100 serum IgG clonotypes <lb/>identified, three of the clonotypes were present in such high <lb/>concentrations that they comprised almost half of the total <lb/>serum IgG population (11). The complexity of a human serum <lb/>polyclonal antibody population (pAb) is thus dependent on <lb/>the immune status of the individual and the time after infec-<lb/>tion which means that the number of antigen-specific anti-<lb/>bodies in the pAb sample will vary. Thus, little is known about <lb/>how well the mAbs sequenced from PB represent the serum <lb/>antibodies present after infection or vaccination. In addition, <lb/>individual antibodies present in a serum pAb sample against <lb/></body>

			<body>a given antigen will bind with different binding affinities and <lb/>may be antagonistic. Vice versa, it has been shown that an-<lb/>tibodies without neutralizing or bactericidal activity alone can <lb/>obtain synergistic activity effects as pairs or as oligoclonal <lb/>mixtures (12-15). Thus, the epitopes recognized by individual <lb/>mAbs sequenced from PB-derived B cells cannot be <lb/>assumed to be additive and directly reflect the collective <lb/>epitopes recognized by the full Ab population in a pAb <lb/>sample. <lb/>HDX-MS has proved to be useful for epitope mapping with <lb/>antibody samples of increasing complexity. One study has <lb/>used different combinations of up to four human mAbs (16). <lb/>Other studies have shown the feasibility of using antigen-<lb/>specific pAb purified/enriched from immunized goats (17) or <lb/>mice (18). To our knowledge, HDX-MS has so far not been <lb/>used for epitope mapping of human pAb samples without <lb/>enrichment of antigen-specific pAb (19). <lb/>Here, we use an optimized HDX-MS approach to map the <lb/>binding of both unpurified and enriched human pAb sam-<lb/>ples to the factor H binding protein (fHbp) (20). fHbp is one <lb/>of the main antigens in the 4CMenB vaccine against Neis-<lb/>seria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) (21). In MenB, fHbp is <lb/>a surface-exposed lipoprotein that plays a key role in <lb/>evading human immune responses through binding to hu-<lb/>man complement factor H (22). The C-terminal of fHbp <lb/>consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel while the <lb/>N-terminal consists of an antiparallel β-sheet and two small <lb/>helical segments with high intrinsic flexibility (23). Using <lb/>HDX-MS, we successfully map the collective epitopes on <lb/>fHbp of pAb populations isolated from two human donors <lb/>(HDs) vaccinated with 4CMenB. Our data shows that the <lb/>pAb from both HDs impact similar regions of fHbp providing <lb/>important insights into the immunodominant regions on <lb/>fHbp that are recognized by the human immune response. <lb/>From a methodological perspective, our results highlight <lb/>how HDX-MS can be used to identify the coexisting epi-<lb/>topes that are collectively recognized by distinct human <lb/>pAb populations. <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES <lb/>Enrollment of Bexsero Vaccinees for Human Sample Collection <lb/>Human samples from healthy adults immunized with multicompo-<lb/>nent serogroup B meningococcal vaccines containing recombinant <lb/>fHbp variant 1, were obtained from a Phase I clinical study conducted <lb/>in Krakow, Poland, and sponsored by Novartis Vaccine, now part of <lb/>the GSK group of Companies and from an observational unblinded <lb/>and not randomized clinical trial conducted in Siena, Italy, and <lb/>sponsored by Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences. The Clinical trial <lb/>protocols were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the District <lb/>Medical Doctors&apos; Chamber in Krakow and the Comitato Etico di Area <lb/>Vasta Sud Est ethics committees, respectively. Studies were con-<lb/>ducted according to good clinical practice in accordance with the <lb/>Declaration of Helsinki (European Council 2001, US Code of Federal <lb/>Regulations, ICH 1997). Written informed consents were obtained <lb/>from the subjects. <lb/>Purification of Polyclonal and fHbp-Specific Antibodies <lb/>Antibodies were purified from two 4CMenB-vaccinated human in-<lb/>dividuals, here referred to as HD1 and HD2. Serum from HD1 was <lb/>collected 30 days after administration of the third dose of the vaccine, <lb/>3 months after administration of the first dose. Serum from HD2 was <lb/>collected 30 days after administration of the first dose of the vaccine. <lb/>Extraction of polyclonal antibodies and the subsequent purification of <lb/>fHbp-specific antibodies were performed using a peristaltic pump or <lb/>an ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) using the same workflow. Before <lb/>purification, serum was filtered through a sterile filter (Millex GP <lb/>0.22 μm) and diluted 1:1 (v/v) with binding buffer (300 mM NaCl, <lb/>50 mM NaP, pH 7.2). Purification of polyclonal antibodies was per-<lb/>formed using two connected HiTrap 5 ml HP columns (GE Healthcare) <lb/>containing Protein A and G, respectively. For further purification of <lb/>fHbp-specific antibodies, 10 mg recombinant fHbp was immobilized <lb/>on a 5 ml NHS HP SpinTrap using the corresponding buffer kit (GE <lb/>Healthcare) according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. The samples <lb/>were loaded on the columns at a flow rate of 3 ml/min until complete <lb/>loading of the total sample volume. After complete loading of the <lb/>sample, the column was washed with 50 ml binding buffer at a flow <lb/>rate of 5 ml/min. The antibodies were eluted from the column at a flow <lb/>rate of 5 ml/min with 25 ml elution buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 2.6) into <lb/>0.5 ml fractions collected in tubes containing neutralizing buffer (1 M <lb/>Tris, pH 9.0). Fractions were run on a NuPAGE four to 12% Bis-Tris gel <lb/>(Invitrogen) and fractions containing antibody were pooled and dia-<lb/>lyzed (PBS, pH 7.4) at 5 • C overnight. <lb/>Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange <lb/>HDX-MS analysis was performed using the following samples: a) <lb/>fHbp in absence or presence of pAb (HD1) in Ag:Ab ratios 1:2, 1:6 or <lb/>1:12 (7.5 pmol fHbp and 15 pmol, 45 pmol, or 90 pmol pAb, respec-<lb/>tively), was diluted in 99.9% D 2 O (PBS, pH 7.4) to a final D 2 O content <lb/>of 90% and quenched after 10 min, 100 min and 24 h; b) fHbp in <lb/>absence or presence of pAb (HD1) in Ag:Ab ratio 1:9 (10 pmol fHbp <lb/>and 90 pmol pAb), was diluted in 99.9% D 2 O (PBS, pH 7.4) with or <lb/>without 0.5 M urea to a final D 2 O content of 90% and quenched after <lb/>15 s, 1 min, 10 min (in triplicate), 100 min and 24 h; c) fHbp in absence <lb/>or presence of pAb (HD2) in Ag:Ab ratio 1:20 (7.5 pmol fHbp and 150 <lb/>pmol pAb), was diluted in 99.9% D 2 O (PBS, pH 7.4) with or without <lb/>0.5 M urea or 0.5 M NaCl to a final D 2 O content of 90% and quenched <lb/>after 15 s and 10 min (both in triplicates); d) fHbp in absence or <lb/>presence of fHbp-specific pAb (HD2) in Ag:Ab ratio 1:2 and 1:5 (5 <lb/>pmol fHbp and 10 pmol pAb or 25 pmol pAb, respectively), was <lb/>diluted in 99.9% D 2 O (PBS, pH 7.4) to a final D 2 O content of 90% and <lb/>quenched after 15 s, 10 min, 100 min (all in triplicates). Samples were <lb/>pre-incubated at 30 min followed by deuterium labeling at 25 • C. Al-<lb/>iquots (50 μl) were removed from the labeling reaction at the specified <lb/>time intervals and quenched 1:1 to a final pH of 2.5 in ice-cold quench <lb/>buffer (4 M GndHCl, 215 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 2.3) and immediately frozen <lb/>to -80 • C until LC-MS analysis. Maximally labeled controls were <lb/>prepared in triplicate by incubating fHbp in 6M deuterated GndHCl for <lb/>24 h at 25 • C (final D 2 O content of 90%). <lb/>HDX-MS Analyses <lb/>Quenched deuterated protein samples were quickly thawed and <lb/>immediately injected onto a UPLC system (NanoACQUITY HDX <lb/>technology, Waters) coupled to a hybrid Q-TOF Synapt G2-Si mass <lb/>spectrometer (Waters).

Peptides were <lb/>eluted form the trap and onto the analytical column at a flow rate of <lb/>40 μl/min and a 7 min gradient from 8% to 40% of mobile phase B <lb/>(0.23% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) and into the Synapt G2-Si mass <lb/>spectrometer for mass analysis. The ESI source was operated in <lb/>positive ion mode and the instrument was enabled for ion mobility <lb/>analysis. Glu-Fibrinopeptide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) was used <lb/>for internal calibration and as reference lock-spray signal. <lb/>For the identification of peptides, non-deuterated samples of fHbp <lb/>were analyzed with the same LC method and peptides were frag-<lb/>mented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) using data-dependent <lb/>acquisition (DDA) mode. Peptide identifications were made through <lb/>the processing of MS/MS data using ProteinLynx Global Server <lb/>(PLGS) version 3.0 (Waters) with a peptide tolerance of 15 ppm and a <lb/>fragment tolerance of 0.1 Da. Peptides with a ladder score below four <lb/>were discarded and the remaining peptides were manually evaluated <lb/>through inspection of the fragmentation spectra. HDX-MS data was <lb/>processed in DynamX 3.0 (Waters) and all peptides were manually <lb/>checked and mass spectra with significant signal overlap or a S/N <lb/>ratio below 10 were excluded from the analysis. <lb/>Back-exchange was calculated for each of the analyzed peptides, <lb/>as described in the community-based recommendations for HDX-MS <lb/>experiments (24). The HDX results were mapped onto the fHbp crystal <lb/>structure (PDB code 3KVD) using PyMOL. To allow access to the HDX <lb/>data of this study, the HDX Data Tables and the HDX Summary <lb/>Tables (supplemnetal Tables S1-S10) are included in the Supporting <lb/>Information according to the community-based recommendations <lb/>(24). <lb/>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale <lb/>Samples from epitope mapping with pAb from HD1 and HD2 were <lb/>analyzed as technical triplicates. To provide a robust framework for <lb/>comparing the differences in HDX between two experiments, a <lb/>threshold value for a statistically significant difference was calculated <lb/>based on an approach modified from (25, 26) using all data points in <lb/>both experiments for which triplicate measurements were available. <lb/>A statistical significance threshold was calculated based on the <lb/>pooled standard deviation of all peptides in the HDX measurements <lb/>performed in triplicates with a 99% confidence interval as described <lb/>previously (26). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Optimizing Experimental Conditions for HDX-MS-Based <lb/>Epitope Mapping Using Human pAb <lb/>We extracted pAb from 4CMenB-vaccinated HD1 and per-<lb/>formed a preliminary screening HDX-MS experiment using this <lb/>sample to investigate if: i) the pAb sample contained enough <lb/>fHbp-specific Ab for binding effects to be detected, and ii) an <lb/>optimal ratio of fHbp:pAb required for probing binding effects <lb/>could be established. In this initial HDX-MS experiment, three <lb/>ratios of fHbp:pAb (1:2, 1:6 and 1:12) were used. In this pre-<lb/>liminary experiment, only the HDX of 12 peptides could be <lb/>reliably monitored across all three ratios, providing a <lb/>sequence coverage of 54%. The test showed that peptides <lb/>comprising residues 3 to 31, 44 to 71 and 235 to 246 were <lb/>protected from HDX in presence of pAb in all three ratios <lb/>(Fig. 1). <lb/>Generally, the presence of pAb in ratios 1:6 and 1:12 <lb/>resulted in very similar uptake differences. In peptides 3 to 31 <lb/>and 44 to 71, the 1:2 ratio showed less protection from HDX <lb/>than the two other ratios, while peptides 29 to 42 and 92 to <lb/>184 showed more protection from HDX in the 1:2 ratio. <lb/>Overall, the test showed first that the pAb samples do contain <lb/>enough fHbp-specific Ab for binding effects to be probed. <lb/>Furthermore, fHbp:pAb ratios above 1:6 provides the largest <lb/>HDX differences. Although the test was performed without <lb/>replicates, it indicated that peptides 3 to 31 and 44 to 71 were <lb/>protected from HDX in the presence of pAb, which could <lb/>suggest that those regions are potential epitopes or regions <lb/>that are conformationally linked to binding. <lb/>Epitope Mapping of fHbp With pAb From HD1 <lb/>The pAb extracted from HD1 was subsequently used for a <lb/>comprehensive HDX-MS epitope mapping experiment. The <lb/>epitope mapping experiment was performed using a 1:9 <lb/>fHbp:pAb ratio. To investigate the presence of unwanted un-<lb/>specific binding effects, the HDX-MS experiment was per-<lb/>formed both in the absence and presence of 0.5 M urea as <lb/>described previously (20). A difference plot of fHbp with and <lb/>without 0.5 M urea was plotted to assess any significant in-<lb/>fluence (supplemental Fig. S3). At the 10 and 100 min time-<lb/>points no significant uptake difference could be detected in <lb/>any of the peptides. At the 15 s, 1 min and 24 h timepoint <lb/>some peptides covering residues 3 to 31 and 44 to 71 showed <lb/>small differences in HDX. Thus, 0.5 M urea had only minor <lb/>impact on the HDX of two regions of fHbp and did not appear <lb/>to cause major changes to the native conformation of the <lb/>protein. <lb/>The HDX of a total of 27 peptides of fHbp could be reliably <lb/>monitored, corresponding to a sequence coverage of 88%. <lb/>Peptides that were not covered were in most cases identified <lb/>FIG. 1. Investigating the impact of different pAb concentrations <lb/>on the HDX of fHbp. The ΔHDX is depicted on the y-axis and the <lb/>identified peptides are listed on the x-axis starting from the N-terminus <lb/>of fHbp. Positive and negative ΔHDX values in the presence of pAb <lb/>indicate reduced and increased HDX, respectively.

            <body>in the absence of pAb but could not be confidently identified in <lb/>the presence of pAb due to spectral overlap. The impact of <lb/>pAb on the HDX of fHbp was very similar in the absence and <lb/>presence of urea (Fig. 2). In absence of urea, the peptides <lb/>comprising residues 3 to 31, 44 to 71, and 102 to 132 showed <lb/>significant decreases in HDX in the presence of pAb, while <lb/>peptide 234 to 246 showed a smaller yet significant decrease <lb/>in HDX in presence of pAb (Fig. 2A). In presence of urea, <lb/>peptides comprising residues 3 to 31, 44 to 71, 102 to 118 <lb/>showed significant and pronounced decreases in HDX in <lb/>presence of pAb, while also peptide 234 to 246 showed a <lb/>smaller yet still significant decrease in HDX (Fig. 2B). <lb/>Thus, the main difference observed upon the addition of urea <lb/>was seen in residues 102 to 132, where peptides covering all <lb/>residues showed significant protection from HDX in the <lb/>absence of urea, while only residues 102 to 118 showed a <lb/>significant reduction in HDX in presence of urea. The changes in <lb/>HDX observed in the region of residues 119 to 132 without urea <lb/>present were therefore ascribed to non-specific binding effects <lb/>and was not considered to be part of the dominant epitopes <lb/>recognized by the pAb from HD1. The regions with significant <lb/>decrease in HDX in presence of pAb and urea form a continuous <lb/>surface on fHbp, extending from one side of the bottom of the <lb/>C-terminal β-barrel, across several strands of the N-terminal <lb/>antiparallel β-sheet to encompass the highly dynamic N-ter-<lb/>minal helices (Fig. 2C). In conclusion, the immunodominant <lb/>epitopes of fHbp recognized by pAb from HD1, localize to <lb/>residues 3 to 31, 44 to 71, 102 to 118, while residues 234 to 246 <lb/>might comprise a less dominant epitope. <lb/>Two mAbs (1A12 and 1A3) have previously been produced <lb/>from B-cell repertoire sequences from HD1 (13). The epitopes <lb/>on fHbp recognized by the two mAbs have been investigated <lb/>with HDX-MS (27). The epitope recognized by mAb 1A12 <lb/>comprised residues 228 to 245 and the epitope recognized by <lb/>mAb 1A3 comprised residues 2 to 27 and 101 to 119. The <lb/>immuno-dominant epitopes of fHbp comprising residues 3 to <lb/>31 and 102 to 118 identified for HD1 pAb are thus in excellent <lb/>agreement with encompassing the epitope of mAb 1A3. The <lb/>residues 234 to 246 that showed small yet significant pro-<lb/>tection from HDX in presence of pAb, overlap with the epitope <lb/>recognized by mAb 1A12. The epitope comprising residues 44 <lb/>to 71 is not recognized by any of the two mAbs and has not <lb/>been previously reported for any mAb. This highlights the <lb/>importance of performing epitope mapping experiments also <lb/>with pAb samples and could indicate either that the pAb <lb/>sample has a high concentration of a few high affinity mAbs <lb/>that are responsible for the main humoral response, or that the <lb/>pAb sample consists of many different mAbs that recognize <lb/>the same immunodominant mAbs. <lb/>Epitope Mapping of fHbp With pAb From HD2. <lb/>Having established that the pAb from HD1 contained <lb/>enough fHbp-specific Ab for detecting immunodominant epi-<lb/>topes, we extracted the pAb from a second donor, HD2. <lb/>Epitope mapping was performed in the absence and presence <lb/>of either 0.5 M urea or 0.5 M NaCl to avoid unspecific binding <lb/>as described previously (20). The 10-minute timepoint was <lb/>used for triplicate measurements. A total of 37 peptides were <lb/>identified, corresponding to a sequence coverage of 99% with <lb/>a mean back-exchange of 33%. Generally, the protection from <lb/>HDX in the presence of pAb and in the absence and presence <lb/>of urea or salt did not show any significant differences (Fig. 3). <lb/>In the presence of pAb, significant reduction in HDX was <lb/>observed for all conditions in residues 3 to 71 and 91 to 132, <lb/>while residues 168 to 184 and 235 to 258 showed smaller yet <lb/>significant reductions. In conclusion, the immunodominant <lb/>epitopes of fHbp recognized by the pAb from HD2, localize to <lb/>residues 3 to 71 and 91 to 132, while residues 168 to 184 and <lb/>235 to 258 may comprise less dominant epitopes or be the <lb/>result of allosteric effects upon binding. <lb/>Epitope Mapping of fHbp with Purified fHbp-specific pAb <lb/>from HD2 <lb/>To further investigate impact of pAb sample complexity on <lb/>the binding epitopes on fHbp, we affinity purified the pAb from <lb/>HD2 using a column with immobilized fHbp to obtain a pAb <lb/>with only fHbp-specific Abs. Two ratios (1:2 and 1:5) of the <lb/>fHbp-specific pAb were used for epitope mapping of fHbp. <lb/>Both the 10 and 100 min time points were used for triplicate <lb/>measurements. A total of 50 peptides were identified, corre-<lb/>sponding to a sequence coverage of 99%. In the presence of <lb/>fHbp-specific pAb, significant protection from HDX was <lb/>observed in residues 3 to 15, 32 to 71 and 102 to 166, while <lb/>residues 235 to 258 showed smaller yet significant protection <lb/>(Fig. 4). <lb/>The identified epitopes comprising residues 3 to 15, 32 to <lb/>71 and the less dominant epitope comprising residues 235 to <lb/>258 are in good agreement with the epitope mapping data of <lb/>the total pAb population. The epitope comprising residues 102 <lb/>to 166 recognized by the fHbp-specific pAb overlap with the <lb/>epitope comprising residues 91 to 132 recognized by the pAb. <lb/>Interestingly, the epitope comprising residues 15 to 31 and <lb/>168 to 184 recognized by the pAb was not recognized by the <lb/>fHbp-specific pAb, which could indicate that these are in fact <lb/>not part of the immunodominant epitopes and that the Abs <lb/>recognizing these two epitopes are smaller subpopulation that <lb/>was lost during further purification likely due to lower binding <lb/>affinity. Another explanation could simply be that the 1:2 and <lb/>1:5 ratios used with the fHbp-specific pAb are too low to <lb/>detect all epitopes. Finally, we note that in an HDX-MS epitope <lb/>mapping experiment using pAb samples, there could be <lb/>subpopulations of fHbp with different antibodies bound to <lb/>different epitopes. This could result in broadened isotopic <lb/>envelopes for peptides spanning the regions of fHbp that <lb/>display changes in HDX upon addition of pAb. However, we <lb/>did not detect such phenomenon. One explanation could be <lb/>that the modest magnitude of the differences in HDX observed <lb/>by the presence of pAb (&lt;1 Da) limits detection of a <lb/></body>

            <body>broadening of the isotopic envelope due to any heterogeneity <lb/>in the binding effect. Another explanation could be that the <lb/>identified epitopes are immunodominant and recognized by <lb/>the most abundant antibodies in the pAb. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Here we show that the complex mixture of human pAb <lb/>from vaccinated individuals can be directly used for mapping <lb/>of the immunodominant epitopes on a protein antigen by <lb/>HDX-MS. <lb/>From the epitope mapping of fHbp with pAb from HD1 <lb/>and HD2, it is clear that residues 3 to 15, 44 to 71 and 102 <lb/>to 118 are the shortest common immunodominant epitopes <lb/>recognized by pAbs from both donors. Less dominant epi-<lb/>topes comprising residues 15 to 32 and 235 to 246 were <lb/>also identified in both donors. Epitope mapping of fHbp-<lb/>specific pAb from HD2 revealed immunodominant epitopes <lb/>that overlapped with those identified for the total pAb <lb/>population from the same HD, indicating that epitope <lb/>mapping with a pAb sample does not necessarily require <lb/>purification of the antigen-specific Ab. The main difference <lb/>observed in the epitope mapping of total pAb and fHbp-<lb/>specific pAb from HD2 was the epitope comprising resi-<lb/>dues 168 to 184, which was identified in the total pAb <lb/>sample but not in the fHbp-specific sample. Two mAbs <lb/>produced from the B-cell repertoire of HD1 have previously <lb/>been used for epitope mapping with HDX-MS, and the <lb/>epitopes that they recognize overlap with the epitopes that <lb/>we identified for the pAb from HD1. This indicates that HDX-<lb/>MS epitope mapping with a pAb sample can allow simul-<lb/>taneous identification of epitopes recognized by different <lb/>mAbs. We conclude that the use of HDX-MS for epitope <lb/>mapping with total pAb samples could be an advantageous <lb/>approach for fast screening of immunodominant epitopes in <lb/>all stages of vaccine development and in studies of natural <lb/>immunity against new pathogens. <lb/>FIG. 3.
