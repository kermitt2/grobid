This is because colchicine&apos;s axially chiral methoxytropone-trimethoxybenzene (called the <lb/>AC ring) is directly responsible for tubulin binding and is thermodynamically set into the requisite aR form by a point chiral <lb/>acetamido group on its B ring. Indeed, desacetamidocolchicine (DAAC), a colchicine analogue without the acetamido group, <lb/>racemizes within minutes. Herein, we describe the synthesis as well as physical and biological characterization of a series of AC ring-<lb/>containing molecules that represent B-ring further deconstructed variants of DAAC. These studies revealed a novel analogue with an <lb/>AC ring that is highly stable to epimerization based not on thermodynamic stabilization but rather a high rotational barrier energy. <lb/>Profiling and characterization of the dihedral angles were carried out computationally and experimentally using vibrational circular <lb/>dichroism, demonstrating that the ground state dihedral angles of the new molecules differ significantly from those of colchicine. <lb/>However, despite this difference, the molecule retained antiproliferative, tubulin-binding, and tubulin polymerization inhibitory <lb/>activity. <lb/></front>

			<body>■ INTRODUCTION <lb/>(-)-Colchicine (1, Figure 1A) is one of the world&apos;s oldest <lb/>known medicines, dating back to at least ancient Egypt, when <lb/>its natural product source, the autumn crocus, was used for <lb/>treatment of inflammation. 1 In more recent times, the pure <lb/>form of colchicine has been used as an FDA-approved drug <lb/>most closely associated with gout, but also used for prevention <lb/>of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. 2 There is also <lb/>growing interest in other applications. 3 For example, the FDA <lb/>very recently approved colchicine for use in the prevention of <lb/>cardiovascular disease. 4 Colchicine&apos;s broad value is generally <lb/>tied to its microtubule destabilizing activity, 5 which is the <lb/>mechanism through which many of the most important and <lb/>widely used chemotherapeutics work. While colchicine is not <lb/>currently used clinically as a chemotherapeutic due to its high <lb/>toxicity, there is high active interest in the development of <lb/>antiproliferative agents that target the colchicine-binding site of <lb/>tubulin. 6 <lb/>(-)-Colchicine&apos;s tubulin-binding is directly related to its <lb/>axially chiral AC ring, which is thermodynamically set into the <lb/>preferred tubulin-binding aR (axial R) form by nearby S point <lb/>chirality on its 7-membered B ring. 7 While (+)-colchicine, <lb/>which favors the aS form of the AC ring due to its alternative R <lb/>point chirality, is a substantially less potent tubulin inhibitor, 8 <lb/>the readily racemizable AC ring-bearing desacetamidocolchi-<lb/>cine (2, DAAC, Figure 1A) 9 and [2-methoxy-5-(2,3,4-<lb/>trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one] (3, MTC, Fig-<lb/>ure 1A) 10 each maintain potent tubulin-based antiproliferative <lb/>activity in line with (-)-colchicine. Given the importance of <lb/>the AC ring, there has been considerable interest in <lb/>understanding how its configuration influences both con-<lb/>formation and binding. 11 However, with few exceptions, 12 <lb/>biological studies on AC ring-containing analogs have relied on <lb/>semisynthetic derivatives of the natural product source. 13 <lb/></body>

			<body>Herein, we describe the de novo construction of several <lb/>structural intermediates between DAAC and MTC. These are <lb/>named Methyl on Tropone of MTC (MT-MTC, 4, Figure <lb/>1B), Methyl on Benzene of MTC (MB-MTC, 5), and <lb/>DiMethyl MTC (DM-MTC, 6). These studies were enabled <lb/>by a recently described oxidopyrylium cycloaddition/reductive <lb/>ring-opening approach to methoxytropones. 14 Through the <lb/>course of these studies, we identified a highly configurationally <lb/>stable AC ring analogue, (aR)-6, that has tubulin-inhibition <lb/>and antiproliferative activity despite a ground-state dihedral <lb/>angle and a steep energetic well that varies substantially from <lb/>AC dihedral angle binding of known colchicine analogs. 15 <lb/>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Computational Modeling and Profiling of Torsional <lb/>Angles. The dynamics of the torsional angles of methylated <lb/>AC ring analogs 4-6 were studied computationally by carrying <lb/>out a relaxed coordinate scan with Schrodinger Suite&apos;s Jaguar <lb/>software. 16 In these studies, an optimized geometry was <lb/>generated, and the dihedral angle χ was varied in an iterative <lb/>nature by 10°(Scheme 1A). A full 360°beyond the first <lb/>coplanar orientation was scanned in order to establish a full <lb/>and iterative 0-360°window (Scheme 1B). Of note, the three <lb/>methoxy groups on the A ring did not reorganize during the <lb/>simulations due to their proximity, and this caused <lb/>enantiomers with different energies near the ground-states. <lb/>Thus, for ground-state profiling, the lowest energy of each <lb/>enantiomer was chosen as the most accurate ground-state for <lb/>each pose. These values are plotted from 0-180°in Scheme <lb/>1C. 17 <lb/>The dihedral angle of the minimized structures for MTC (3) <lb/>was 129.1°, although profiling of its dihedral angle revealed an <lb/>energetically comparable pose at ∼50°(blue, Scheme 1C). <lb/>This observation, as well as local energetic maxima at its planar <lb/>and perpendicular orientations, have been observed previ-<lb/>ously. 18 A similar set of two near energetically equivalent local <lb/>minima were also observed for MB-MTC (5) at ∼120°and <lb/>60°, shifted toward the perpendicular orientation (magenta, <lb/>Scheme 1C). We consider these two energetic minima to <lb/>represent a &quot;colchicine-type&quot; pose (∼60°) and an &quot;isocolchi-<lb/>cine-type&quot; pose (∼120°), as they closely match the dihedral <lb/>angles of the AC ring in colchicine and isocolchicine, <lb/>respectively (see Scheme 1A for reference and Scheme 3E <lb/>for structure of isocolchicine). MT-MTC (4), meanwhile, has <lb/>a more defined energetic minimum at 112.9°, and its <lb/>colchicine-type pose (∼60°) is roughly 2 kcal/mol uphill in <lb/>energy (green, Scheme 1C). While 4 and 5 differ significantly <lb/>near their ground state, they share a similar barrier to <lb/>Figure 1. Tubulin-binding AC ring containing molecules.

			<body>enantiomerization (∼17 kcal/mol), which is significantly <lb/>higher than that of MTC (3, ΔG ‡ = 6.8 kcal/mol), but <lb/>below that of DAAC (2, ΔG ‡ = 22.1 kcal/mol). 19 DM-MTC <lb/>(6) has a ground-state profile similar to MT-MTC (4) (red vs <lb/>green, Scheme 1C), but it possesses a sharper energetic well <lb/>and a ground-state closer to a coplanar orientation (χ = <lb/>101.1°). It also possesses a very high rotational barrier (ΔG ‡ <lb/>calc <lb/>= 30.2 kcal/mol), which would place it at the frontier of class 3 <lb/>atropisomer designation. The term &quot;class 3 atropisomer&quot; <lb/>describes molecules with rotational barriers of chiral axes <lb/>above 30 kcal/mol, and medicinal chemists generally view such <lb/>molecules as candidates for single atropisomer drug develop-<lb/>ment. 20 This distinguishes them from compounds with <lb/>moderately stable chiral axes that are not good candidates <lb/>for single atropisomer drug development (ΔG ‡ = 22-30 kcal/ <lb/>mol, &quot;class 2&quot;), and unstable chiral axes (ΔG ‡ &lt; 22 kcal/mol, <lb/>&quot;class 1&apos;). The implications to this are that if (aR)-6 is active, it <lb/>would have a narrow range of accessible dihedral angles that <lb/>are mostly distinct from those accessible for (-)-colchicine 18 <lb/>and could thereby alter its selectivity and physiochemical <lb/>properties. Given that the broad medicinal value of <lb/>(-)-colchicine is directly tied to this AC ring, the synthesis, <lb/>physical, and biochemical evaluation of 6 was warranted. <lb/>Synthesis of AC Ring Analogs. Established methods for <lb/>synthesizing the AC ring of colchicine are almost exclusively <lb/>related to the natural product total synthesis 21 and are not <lb/>easily adaptable to analogs without a B ring. The only <lb/>established AC ring strategy that seemed viable for the <lb/>synthesis of 6 was an 11-step synthesis of a chloro-AC analog <lb/>reported over 30 years ago by Banwell. 12a We recently <lb/>described a convenient oxidopyrylium (5 + 2) cycloaddition/ <lb/>reductive ring-opening approach to access methoxytropones <lb/>that could be used to generate the AC ring system. 14,22 Using <lb/>this strategy, cycloadduct 18 was generated from alkyne 14 and <lb/>oxidopyrylium ylide dimer 12 and treated with samarium <lb/>iodide with an acidic aqueous workup (pH 3 phosphate <lb/>buffer). 23 Excitingly, the only product observed was the AC <lb/>ring analogue iso-6 (Scheme 2). iso-6 was viewed as a valuable <lb/>control molecule, as it has accessible torsional angles of the AC <lb/>ring more consistent with isocolchicine. 24 It could also be <lb/>converted to 6 through demethylation followed by a <lb/>nonselective methylation, 25 providing a separable mixture of <lb/>iso-6 and 6. By substituting alternative oxidopyrylium dimer 11 <lb/>and/or alkyne (13), this route also provided additional analogs <lb/>3, iso-4, 4 and 5. Of note, cycloaddition reactions with dimer <lb/>11 was sluggish and low yielding, and required higher <lb/>temperatures that appears to produce a reaction-compromising <lb/>Scheme 1.

			<body>dimer rearrangement. 26 Fortunately for the present studies, <lb/>cycloadducts derived from 14 were only a single step from the <lb/>target molecules. It is worth noting that this lower reactivity <lb/>presently prevents a more direct route to 6 from oxidopyrylium <lb/>dimer 11 and an even less-reactive alkyne-methylated variant <lb/>of 14, but efforts are underway to address this limitation. <lb/>Chiral Resolution, Characterization, and Configura-<lb/>tional Stability Studies. (aR)-6 and (aS)-6 were readily <lb/>separable from one another and racemic iso-6 through the use <lb/>of a polysaccharide-based chiral column (Diacel IA column) 27 <lb/>fitted to an automated medium-pressure liquid chromatog-<lb/>raphy unit (Biotage Isolera Prime). Racemization was <lb/>observable after heating a solution of either enantiopure <lb/>(aR)-or (aS)-6 at 135 °C in xylenes over a few hours, 16 and <lb/>the rate of enantiomerization was extrapolated using the Eyring <lb/>equation (ΔG ‡ = 31.2 ± 0.3 kcal/mol). 28 (aR)-and (aS)-iso-6 <lb/>were separable in an analogous fashion using a chiral IC <lb/>polysaccharide column. However, no racemization was <lb/>observed, even after heating to 145 °C for 10 h, at which <lb/>point decomposition was observed. Thus, we can project that <lb/>the rotational energy barrier is only 37 kcal/mol. However, a <lb/>computationally determined rotational barrier for iso-6 was <lb/>33.5 kcal/mol, which is roughly 3 kcal/mol more than that <lb/>calculated for 6. One potential explanation for this notable <lb/>difference in configurational stability is the greater double <lb/>bond character of the methyl-bearing C 4 -C 5 carbon of iso-6 in <lb/>comparison to the C 5 -C 6 in 6, as this would both shorten and <lb/>rigidify this steric-bearing bond (see Scheme 3A/B for details). <lb/>Evaluation of the lower-in-energy local maxima from the <lb/>torsional scan (χ = 170°) reveals that the smaller bond <lb/>distance of iso-6 (1.39 Å vs 1.48 Å) leads to a larger torsional <lb/>angle between the methyl and methoxy-bearing oxygens (blue, <lb/>χ 2 = 9.9°vs 6.9°) and smaller distance between the appendages <lb/>(2.60 vs 2.68 Å) (Scheme 3C). Studies have previously <lb/>described differences in rotational barriers of DAAC (2) and <lb/>its analogous isomer that, while less dramatic, are consistent <lb/>with this trend (ΔG ‡ = 22.1 vs 23.4 kcal/mol). 18 <lb/>Absolute stereochemistry of (aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-iso-6, and <lb/>(aS)-iso-6 were determined using VCD (Scheme 3). 29 VCD is <lb/>a technique which evaluates CD spectra in the IR range and <lb/>can be used in combination with density functional theory-<lb/>based modeling to determine absolute stereochemistry and to <lb/>provide insight into conformations in solution. Molecular <lb/>modeling of both (aR) and (aS)-6 yielded 20 unique <lb/>conformations within 7 kcal/mol of one-another, each of <lb/>which underwent further DFT optimization at several levels of <lb/>theory to calculate VCD. 30 Although many of the methods <lb/>gave computed VCD spectra that closely matched the <lb/>Scheme 2. Oxidopyrylium Cycloaddition/Reductive Ring-Opening Approach to AC Ring Analogs <lb/>a <lb/>iso-4 was also isolated in 19% yield. b Represents combined yield of (aR)-6 (20%) and (aS)-6 (19%), following preparatory chiral resolution via <lb/>Diacel AI polysaccharide-based column.

			<body>experimental spectra, optimization at B3LYP/cc-pVTZ pro-<lb/>vided the best match, and in these studies, 6 conformers were <lb/>identified that contributed 1% or greater to the Boltzmann <lb/>weighted average. While most of the conformational flexibility <lb/>was coming from the methoxy groups, there was some small <lb/>variation of the dihedral angle defining the chiral axis (93-<lb/>100°), with 98.6°contributing to 60.5% of the spectra <lb/>(Scheme 3A). A similar treatment was given to iso-6, with <lb/>the B3PW91/cc-pVTZ combination, this time yielding slightly <lb/>better results than the other methods. Unexpectedly, the VCD <lb/>spectra were considerably different from that of 6 on account <lb/>of the greater variation of dihedral angles of contributing <lb/>molecules (77-104°, Scheme 3B). Most significantly, the <lb/>major contributor has a dihedral angle of 77.5°(55.5% <lb/>contribution share), whereas the second greatest contributor <lb/>has a vastly different dihedral angle of 103.8°(27.5% <lb/>contribution share). In DFT-based dihedral profiling (M06-<lb/>2X/6-311G**), iso-6 had two ground state minima�one at <lb/>70°and one at 100°�consistent with these findings. 17 These <lb/>two conformations are roughly equidistant from the <lb/>perpendicular conformation, and consequently, many of their <lb/>VCD peaks are equal to and opposite in signal strength, <lb/>weakening the observed signal. <lb/>Given this unexpected difference, we wanted to gauge <lb/>whether the VCD spectra of colchicine and isocolchicine may <lb/>also provide evidence of larger differences in their conformers. <lb/>While a few VCD spectra of colchicine have been reported, 31 <lb/>we are unaware of any published VCD studies of isocolchicine, <lb/>and thus carried out studies on each (Scheme 3D/E), as well <lb/>as their respective enantiomers. 17 In these studies, both <lb/>colchicine and isocolchicine appeared to have very similar <lb/>ranges of dihedral angles in their VCD-contributing con-<lb/>formers. The only notable, major difference seemed to be in <lb/>the molecules&apos; ability to aggregate into dimers. The presence of <lb/>these aggregates made it necessary to model them and <lb/>combine these with the spectra from monomeric forms to <lb/>get consistent data. 17 This aggregation is well-known with <lb/>colchicine, 32 and in our studies the dimer contributed to <lb/>roughly 50% of the VCD spectra. On the other hand, <lb/>isocolchicine dimer aggregate only accounted for roughly <lb/>12.5% of the VCD spectra, which appears to be due to <lb/>differences in ability to generate appropriate hydrogen bond <lb/>network. 17 Regardless, the differences that were observed for 6 <lb/>and iso-6 did not translate in any notable manner to the B-ring <lb/>containing AC rings. <lb/>Biological Testing. The four atropisomeric compound-<lb/>s�(aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-iso-6, and (aS)-iso-6)�were each <lb/>evaluated in the NCI 60 5-point screen. 33 (aR)-6 showed <lb/>substantial growth suppression across various cell-lines at 10 <lb/>μM (Figure 2A), with a mean GI 50 value of 2.4 μM, a <lb/>selectivity range of 2.39 log units, and total growth inhibition <lb/>(TGI) value of 63 μM. A distinct plateau at the TGI level of <lb/>analysis was also observed for (aR)-6, which is characteristic of <lb/>tubulin interactive agents. 34 Meanwhile, (aS)-6 and (aR)-iso-6 <lb/>Scheme 3.

			<body>were not cytotoxic at the highest concentration tested (100 <lb/>μM), and (aS)-iso-6 was approximately 10-fold less potent in <lb/>the NCI-60 screen than (aR)-6 (GI 50 , mean = 27 μM), with a <lb/>smaller selectivity range (1.46 log units) and TGI mean value <lb/>(91 μM). Growth inhibition of (aR)-6 was 10 to 50-fold less <lb/>potent than colchicine. <lb/>The TGI level of responses for (aR)-6 and (aS)-iso-6 were <lb/>subsequently compared to known tubulin interactors using a <lb/>pattern recognition algorithm (COMPARE analysis, Figure <lb/>2B). 35 Many of these known compounds had been tested at <lb/>multiple different high concentrations, and a single set of high <lb/>concentration tests was chosen for each compound, where it <lb/>displayed the most robust selectivity pattern. Notably, (aR)-6 <lb/>showed a meaningful correlation (Pearson correlation &gt;0.5) to <lb/>(-)-colchicine, while (aS)-iso-6 fell short. However, a few <lb/>tubulin-targeting molecules had a significant correlation with <lb/>both molecules: the colchicine site binder centaureidin, the <lb/>vinca site binder dolastatin 10, and taxol. However, the closest <lb/>correlation was in fact between (aR)-6 and (aS)-iso-6, <lb/>supporting a shared mechanism of action. While several well-<lb/>established tubulin inhibitors did not have meaningful <lb/>correlations with either molecule, enough positive correlations <lb/>supported the testing of the compounds in biochemical assays. <lb/>All of the AC ring-containing molecules synthesized were <lb/>subsequently tested for their ability to bind to tubulin (K d ) and <lb/>inhibit microtubule formation (Figure 2C). MTC (3) had the <lb/>lowest binding constant of all compounds tested, and was the <lb/>only compound to inhibit microtubule polymerization at 3 μM. <lb/>Compounds 4, 5, and (aR)-6 had binding constants 5-30 fold <lb/>less potent than 3, but were each capable of inhibiting <lb/>microtubule polymerization at 33 μM. While iso-4 and (aS)-6 <lb/>each appeared to bind to tubulin near the limits of the assays, <lb/>neither compound nor either enantiomer of iso-6 inhibited <lb/>microtubule polymerization at the concentrations tested. <lb/>Growth inhibition studies were carried out with the library <lb/>against select cancer cell-lines, and this activity was tracked <lb/>closely with biochemical assays. Specifically, molecules that did <lb/>not inhibit microtubule polymerization did not have any <lb/>significant growth inhibition in cells, and the differences in <lb/>binding constants of active molecules tracked closely with <lb/>differences in growth inhibition (Figure 2C). (-)-colchicine <lb/>was also tested as a control in cell-based assays, and showed <lb/>comparable activity to MTC (3), consistent with literature <lb/>Figure 2. Representative Biological Results.

			<body>precedence. 10a This data support that the cytotoxicity of (aR)-<lb/>6 is directly related to microtubule disruption, and the lower <lb/>cytotoxicity is because of its lower affinity for tubulin. <lb/>Furthermore, the activity differences between active com-<lb/>pounds tracks with prior energetic well profiling of 3, 4, and <lb/>(aR)-6, which suggested that 4 and 5 prefer an isocolchicine-<lb/>type pose when unbound, and require uphill energetic climbs <lb/>to achieve a dihedral angle near that of colchicine (see Scheme <lb/>1C). 36 The lower activity of 5 is not as clear based on these <lb/>data, but one possibility is that its broad energy well could lead <lb/>to entropic penalties when bound. <lb/>Computational Studies on AC Analog-Tubulin <lb/>Interaction. To glean additional insight into these differences <lb/>in activity, we turned to computational modeling of the library <lb/>in tubulin. Binding constants were calculated using the <lb/>alchemical Relative Binding Free Energy method (RBFE) <lb/>with the AToM-OpenMM software version v3.5.0 37 (https:// <lb/>github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM), and MTC (3) <lb/>was used as a reference. MTC and the other compounds were <lb/>aligned to the crystal structure of colchicine bound to tubulin <lb/>(PDB 5ITZ). 38 Hamiltonian replica exchange alchemical <lb/>molecular dynamics calculations were performed with 22 <lb/>replicas for 20 ns per replica, and 100 ns molecular dynamics <lb/>simulations for the dihedral angle analysis were conducted for <lb/>each compound bound to tubulin and free in solution. From <lb/>this data, we were able to extract a series of poses, through <lb/>which we could profile AC ring dihedral angles bound and <lb/>unbound (ie, Figure 3A), and obtain computational binding <lb/>constants (Figure 3B). <lb/>What was immediately apparent from these studies was that <lb/>for tubulin-active molecules, modeling gave binding constants <lb/>within 5-fold of 3 (4, 5, and (aR)-6), while those that were <lb/>mostly inactive differed by at least 100-fold (Figure 3B). <lb/>Compounds 4 and 5 both bound to tubulin in silico with <lb/>dihedral angle profiles that were comparable to those of 3, <lb/>whereas (aR)-6 bound with much larger dihedral angles. When <lb/>unbound, each of the compounds had comparable average <lb/>dihedral angles that was near coplanar, but differed noticeably <lb/>in their distribution. Specifically, compound 3 had dihedral <lb/>angle distributions nearly uniformly from 50°to 130°, while <lb/>(aR)-6 was mostly in the 80°to 100°range (Figure 3A). 4 <lb/>profiled more similarly to (aR)-6, and 5 more similar to 3, <lb/>consistent with the energetic profiling results (see Scheme <lb/>1C). Thus, (aR)-6 has the smallest change in structure to <lb/>binding, illustrative of its high conformational rigidity. <lb/>Looking more closely at the structures generated in silico, <lb/>two main hydrogen bond contacts are observed (Figure 4). <lb/>Figure 3.

A second hydrogen bond is <lb/>observed between the thiol hydrogen of a highly flexible <lb/>cysteine 241 and the trimethoxybenzene-associated oxygen <lb/>atoms, and more specifically those of the methoxy groups at <lb/>the meta and/or para positions (illustrated in Figure 4). MTC <lb/>(3) shows consistent hydrogen bonding between this thiol and <lb/>at least one of these two trimethoxybenzene-associated <lb/>methoxy groups, whereas it is less frequent in the case of <lb/>(aR)-6. Given that the para methoxy groups are in line with <lb/>the AC chiral axes, the methoxy at the para position is not <lb/>influenced as much by the differences in dihedral angles as the <lb/>meta methoxy groups would be. This could help explain the <lb/>diminished potency of (aR)-6 as compared to 3 observed <lb/>experimentally. Regardless, the drastically different binding <lb/>pose of (aR)-6 to tubulin as compared to colchicine could <lb/>provide intriguing opportunities for studying dihedral influence <lb/>on tubulin inhibition, potentially even isotype selectivity, as <lb/>well as off-target effects. <lb/>■ CONCLUSIONS <lb/>A simple, deconstructed variant of DAAC (2), DM-MTC <lb/>((aR)-6), is highly stable to epimerization with an <lb/>experimental energy barrier to inversion of 31.2 ± 0.3 kcal/ <lb/>mol, nearly 10 kcal/mol higher than that of the B-ring <lb/>containing desacetomidocolchicine (2). Experimental and <lb/>computational studies demonstrate that (aR)-6 exists with a <lb/>torsional angle of its pharmacoactive AC ring of approximately <lb/>100°, which is nearly 50°from how it exists in colchicine both <lb/>in the solution phase and when bound to tubulin. Despite this <lb/>difference, (aR)-6 still possesses cytotoxicity against many cell-<lb/>lines at low micromolar concentrations and is capable of <lb/>binding to tubulin and inhibiting microtubule polymerization. <lb/>Molecular dynamics studies suggest that (aR)-6 may prefer to <lb/>bind to tubulin with a dihedral angle at or around 80°, which <lb/>differentiates it from the 60°dihedral angle preferred 3, 4, and <lb/>5 in similar modeling experiments. Thus, (aR)-6 represents a <lb/>new and novel tubulin binding analogue that could comple-<lb/>ment existing microtubule destabilizing agents that bind to the <lb/>colchicine-binding site. <lb/>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>General Information. All starting materials and reagents were <lb/>purchased from commercially available sources and used without <lb/>further purification except for CH 2 Cl 2 and benzene, which were <lb/>purified on a solvent purification system prior to the reaction. 1 H <lb/>NMR shifts are measured using the solvent residual peak as the <lb/>internal standard (CHCl 3 δ 7.26, D 2 O δ 4.79) and reported as <lb/>follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, bs = broad singlet, d = <lb/>doublet, t = triplet, dd = doublet of doublet, q = quartet, m = <lb/>multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. 13 C NMR shifts <lb/>are measured by using the solvent residual peak as the internal <lb/>standard (CDCl 3 δ 77.20) and reported as chemical shifts. Infrared <lb/>(IR) spectral bands are characterized as broad (br), strong (s), <lb/>medium (m), and weak (w). Microwave reactions were performed via <lb/>the Biotage Initiator 2.5 in a sealed vessel. Purification via reverse <lb/>phase column chromatography was performed on the Biotage Isolera <lb/>Prime, with Biotage SNAP 12 g cartridges, in a solvent system of <lb/>acetonitrile in water, each solvent containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic <lb/>acid (TFA). Oxidopyrilium dimers (11-12) 39 alkyne 13, cyclo-<lb/>adducts 15 and 16, and methoxytropones 3, 4 and iso-4 were <lb/>synthesized as previously reported. 14 <lb/>DFT Calculations. General Information for DFT Calculations. <lb/>Computational modeling was carried out using Schrodinger Suite&apos;s <lb/>Jaguar software. Unless otherwise noted, all calculations were <lb/>performed using the M06-2X functional and the 6-311G** basis <lb/>set in the gas phase at room temperature (298.15 K). This functional <lb/>and basis set was chosen for its cited accuracy for both conformational <lb/>and energetic accuracy. 40 <lb/>Torsional Angle Profiling. AC ring structures (3-6) were <lb/>submitted to a geometry optimization to provide a preliminary <lb/>ground-state conformation. These structures were used to determine <lb/>ground state dihedral angles provided in Scheme 1A. These were then <lb/>submitted to a relaxed coordination scan of dihedral χ in increments <lb/>of 10°, scanned in an iterative rather than simultaneous fashion by <lb/>selecting &quot;previously optimized geometry&quot;, to a final dihedral angle of <lb/>ˈ540°′. This was done in order to obtain a full and iterative 360°w <lb/>indow for each compound (180-540°), and this full window is <lb/>provided in Scheme 1B, adjusted to -180°to 180°, and plotted <lb/>against change in energy (kcal/mol). Additional details can be found <lb/>in the Supporting Information file. <lb/>Free Energy Barrier Determination. Free energy barriers were <lb/>determined as follows. Single point energy, including vibrational <lb/>frequency measurements, were obtained for each molecules&apos; global <lb/>minima and 2 local maxima. In each case, none of the minima (ie, <lb/>GS) had a vibrational frequency, while all of the local maxima (ie, TS) <lb/>had a single negative frequency, and these values are included in the <lb/>Supporting Information. A folder of compiled text files of Cartesian <lb/>coordinates (xyz) from these computations is provided in a separate <lb/>zip file as a unique Supporting Information file. Expected &quot;observed&quot; <lb/>free energies were extrapolated from these values, and additional <lb/>details on these computations can be found in the main Supporting <lb/>Information document. <lb/>Synthesis and Characterization. 2-Ethynyl-2,3,4-trimethoxy-1-<lb/>methylbenzene (14).

VCD Measurements. <lb/>CDCl 3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Silver Foil) was run through <lb/>a small plug of activated basic alumina immediately before use. To a <lb/>small vial containing ∼ 7 mg of chiral molecule ((aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-<lb/>iso-6, (aS)-iso-6, (-)-colchicine or (aR)-isocolchicine) was added 150 <lb/>μL of CDCl 3 . The resulting solution was transferred to a liquid IR cell <lb/>(BaF 2 , 100 μm cell path) and placed in the measurement chamber. <lb/>Experimental spectra were acquired on a BioTools, Inc. (Jupiter, FL) <lb/>ChiralIR 2X Dual PEM FT-VCD spectrometer, set to 4 cm -1 <lb/>resolution, with PEM (both 1 and 2) maximum frequency set to <lb/>1400 cm -1 . The sample was then measured for 6 to 8 h in 1 h blocks. <lb/>The IR data from the first block was solvent and water vapor <lb/>subtracted, then offset to zero at 2000 cm -1 . The VCD data blocks <lb/>were averaged, and enantiomer subtracted ((E1-E2)/2). Finally, the <lb/>VCD spectrum was offset to zero at 2000 cm -1 . The VCD noise data <lb/>were block averaged and used without further processing. <lb/>VCD Calculations. The aR enantiomer of each compound (6, iso-6, <lb/>colchicine and isocolchicine) were constructed (separately) using <lb/>ComputeVOA (BioTools, Jupiter, FL). A thorough conformational <lb/>search was performed for each at the molecular mechanics level using <lb/>the MMF94 force field in a 7 kcal/mol energy window. All <lb/>conformers were subjected to DFT level optimization and frequency <lb/>calculation with Gaussian &apos;09 (Wallingford, CT) 41 at the B3LYP/6-<lb/>31G(d) and B3PW91/6-31G(d) levels. 42 The resulting lowest energy <lb/>unique conformations were reoptimized using the cc-pVTZ/B3LYP <lb/>and cc-pVTZ/B3PW91 method, 42b and the IR and VCD frequencies <lb/>recalculated at these levels. The resulting spectra from all methods <lb/>were Boltzmann averaged (using both free energy and electronic <lb/>energy), plotted at 5 cm -1 resolution, and then x-axis scaled (range of <lb/>0.968 to 0.985-values obtained using CompareVOA (BioTools, <lb/>Jupiter, FL) and varied with basis set and functional) for comparison <lb/>to the experimental IR and VCD spectra. Two different weighing <lb/>methods (free energy and electronic energy) gave consistent results <lb/>for stereochemistry, with the larger cc-pVTZ basis set and electronic <lb/>energy weighting giving results most similar to those of the <lb/>experimental IR and VCD. These were ultimately used for similarity <lb/>values and plots. The excellent visual agreement and high similarity <lb/>values (IR and VCD) as well as confidence level 30 for both 6 and iso-6 <lb/>leaves no doubt that the absolute configuration has been correctly <lb/>assigned. <lb/>Bioactivity Methods for Colchicine AC Analogs. Binding <lb/>Affinity. Binding affinity to the colchicine site of bovine brain tubulin <lb/>(PurSolutions, LLC (puresoluble.com)) was assayed by competition <lb/>of test compounds with MDL ((E)-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-[4-<lb/>(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2-methylprop-2-en-1-one) as described pre-<lb/>viously. 43 MDL fluorescence increases many-fold upon binding to the <lb/>colchicine site of tubulin. Inhibition of this fluorescence increase was <lb/>measured and converted to K d for the test compound as described. <lb/>Tubulin Polymerization Inhibition. Inhibition of tubulin polymer-<lb/>ization was determined as described previously. 44 In brief, 10 μM <lb/>bovine brain tubulin (PurSolutions, LLC (puresoluble.com)) was <lb/>incubated under conditions strongly promoting polymerization of <lb/>tubulin (1 M NaGlutamate, 0.1 M Mes (Morpholinoethanesulfonic <lb/>acid), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM GTP, pH 6.9), in the absence or <lb/>presence of 3.3 or 33 μM test compound, incubated for 30 min at 37 <lb/>°C, then centrifuged at 100,000g for 8 min, and the top 3/4 of the <lb/>supernatant removed. Protein concentration was measured, and <lb/>polymerization was determined as pelletable protein lost from the <lb/>supernatant. <lb/>Cell-Growth Inhibition Studies. Inhibition of cell growth was <lb/>determined by using standard procedures. Cell lines were obtained <lb/>from the NCI anticancer drug screen and maintained in DMEM <lb/>medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Growing cells <lb/>were exposed to serial dilutions of each compound for 3 days. Cell <lb/>growth was determined with CellTiter Assay Reagent (Promega), and <lb/>growth parameters, including inhibition of growth, were measured by <lb/>using the methods specified by the manufacturer. <lb/>60-Cell Screen. (aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aS)-iso-6, and (aR)-iso-6 were <lb/>submitted to the 60 Cell Screen panel and evaluated at 5 doses (100 <lb/>μM, 10 μM, 1 μM, 0.1 μM, and 0.01 μM). A summary of the data for <lb/>all molecules is in Table S5 in the Supporting Information document, <lb/>and a compilation of GI 50 values of active compounds determined <lb/>from these studies along with prior experiment of colchicine is listed <lb/>in Table S6. The complete report from this submission is available at <lb/>the publisher&apos;s Web site as a separate Supporting Information file. For <lb/>COMPARE analysis, TGI levels of response for (aR)-DM-MTC (6) <lb/>and (aS)-iso-DM-MTC were compared to those of several established <lb/>tubulin inhibitors previously tested in the NCI-60 screen. A complete <lb/>list of these data can be viewed in Table S7 in the Supporting <lb/>Information document. <lb/>Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The molecular dynamics <lb/>relative binding free energy calculations 37 were conducted using the <lb/>AToM-OpenMM package version 3.5.0 45 and the ATM MetaForce <lb/>OpenMM plugin version 0.3.5 46 and the OpenMM MD engine <lb/>version 8.0. 47 We used the 5ITZ PDB structure of the tubulin dimer <lb/>bound to colchicine. 38 The AMBER&apos;s FF14SB force field 48 was used <lb/>for the protein receptor, and the TIP3P model was used for the water <lb/>solvent. The GAFF force field was used for parametrizing ligands. <lb/>Starting with the protein receptor and each ligand pair aligned in the <lb/>protein binding site, the second ligand in the pair was translated by <lb/>the displacement vector. The system was then solvated within a <lb/>rectangle box with a 10 Å TIP3P water buffer by tleap from <lb/>AmberTools. Potassium and chloride ions were added to neutralize <lb/>the system, if needed. Relative binding free energy calculations <lb/>employed 22 alchemical replicas, each simulated for 40 ns. Additional <lb/>molecular dynamics runs of the complexes to collect the dihedral <lb/>angle probability distributions were run for 100 ns. 49 <lb/></body>
