			<body>Many viruses can expand their host range with a few mutations 1-3 that enable the <lb/>exploitation of new cellular receptors 2,3 . Such mutations may be the first steps toward an <lb/>epidemic outbreak; this observation has driven an expansion of theoretical 4 , experimental and <lb/>surveillance studies of host-range shifts in emergent pathogens, including avian influenza 5-8 , <lb/>coronaviruses 9,10 , HIV 11 and ebolavirus 12 . Ideally, laboratory evolution experiments could be <lb/>used to accelerate our understanding of how viruses expand their host range. However, it is not <lb/>clear whether viral evolution observed under the chemical and physical environments of a <lb/>laboratory can faithfully inform us about viral evolution in nature, for at least two reasons. First, <lb/>evolutionary trajectories might be sensitive to differences in environmental conditions between <lb/>the laboratory and nature. Second, the number of evolutionary paths sampled in laboratory <lb/>experiments is very small compared to natural virus diversity due to the enormous size of viral <lb/></body>

			<body>populations. Indeed, some researchers have called for the suspension of virus gain-of-function <lb/>laboratory experiments 13 on the grounds that they would tell us little about real-world viral <lb/>evolution at the risk of constructing viral strains that are pandemic to new hosts. Here, we use a <lb/>harmless virus, bacteriophage l, to demonstrate how gain-of-function experiments can identify <lb/>mutations that mimic those that occur in nature: we find that two amino acid residues that are <lb/>critical for gain of function in the laboratory recurrently evolve in nature. <lb/>Typical laboratory strains of l infect Escherichia coli by binding to the outer membrane <lb/>protein LamB 14 , but the phage rapidly evolves in the laboratory to exploit a different membrane <lb/>protein, OmpF 3 . Since OmpF is not the usual E. coli receptor for l, these experiments are a <lb/>proxy for the ability of the phage to switch hosts. The evolved gain-of-function phenotype in l, <lb/>OmpF + , involves multiple non-synonymous mutations in the host-recognition gene J. Each <lb/>OmpF + isolate had between 4 and 10 single nucleotide substitutions in J, and none had insertions <lb/>or deletions (indels). 97% of the substitutions in 24 independently evolved OmpF + l phage <lb/>occurred in the J protein 3 between residues 960-1132, which we call the &apos;specificity region&apos; of <lb/>J (Figure 1A). <lb/>By comparing J among OmpF + and OmpF -l, Meyer et al. (2012) suggested that the <lb/>OmpF + innovation required four mutations: one at residue 1012, two in the codon for residue <lb/>1107, and a fourth mutation somewhere between residues 990 to 1000 3 . In this study, we directly <lb/>tested this hypothesis by using Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) 15 to <lb/>construct two combinatorial genetic libraries of the J mutations that evolved in Meyer et al. <lb/>(2012). We constructed the first library by focusing on 10 commonly evolved J mutations 3 , from <lb/>which we sequenced 33 OmpF + isolates. All strains possessed the target mutation at residue 1012 <lb/>and both target mutations at residue 1107; by contrast, some strains lacked a fourth mutation <lb/>between residues 990 and 1000 (Figure 1). We call the mutations at residues 1012 and 1107 the <lb/>&quot;canonical mutations&quot;. <lb/>To test whether the three canonical mutations were sufficient to confer the OmpF + <lb/>phenotype, we constructed a synthetic phage with just these mutations. Even though the <lb/>synthetic phage was viable, it proved unable to exploit cells without the ancestral LamB receptor, <lb/>demonstrating that at least four J mutations were necessary for laboratory-evolved OmpF + <lb/>phage. To find what further mutations might be needed to confer the OmpF + phenotype, we <lb/>constructed a second MAGE library using the phage with the three canonical J mutations as the <lb/></body>

			<body>baseline, and random combinations of 19 other J mutations found in the OmpF + l evolved by <lb/>Meyer et al. (2012). Screening this second library produced 88 OmpF + isolates. One OmpF + <lb/>isolate had just a single extra mutation in amino acid position 1083 in addition to the three <lb/>canonical mutations (Figure 1). However, the majority of the OmpF + genotypes did not possess <lb/>this specific mutation, signifying that its function could be substituted by other J mutations. In <lb/>total, this experiment revealed that four mutations are sufficient to evolve the innovation, but <lb/>only two specific amino acid changes (at residues 1012 and 1107) are universally required to <lb/>access OmpF in the context of laboratory experiments. <lb/>We then asked whether natural J sequences reflected the host-shift evolutionary dynamics <lb/>seen in our gain-of-function experiments. We collected and aligned full-length homologous J <lb/>protein sequences from UniRef100 16 (1,207 highly similar sequences). Most sequences were <lb/>prophage uncovered in the genomes of their Enterobacteriaceae hosts, including bacterial genera <lb/>Escherichia, Salmonella, Citrobacter, Edwardsiella, and even Cronobacter. <lb/>Recall that 97% of substitutions in OmpF + gain-of-function experiments occur in the <lb/>specificity region. Likewise, the natural J homologs had disproportionate variation here: 30% of <lb/>the total amino acid variation occurred in the specificity region, despite only being 15% of the <lb/>total length of J (Figure 2A). This nonrandom clustering of variation in the specificity region <lb/>strongly suggests that J has experienced substantial diversifying selection on host attachment. <lb/>Furthermore, the 17 residues engineered into the MAGE libraries were significantly more <lb/>variable than randomly chosen groups of 17 residues from J (non-parametric bootstrap: p &lt; 10 -5 ) <lb/>and from the specificity region 960-1132 (non-parametric bootstrap: p = 0.0054) showing the <lb/>experiments had identified evolutionary hotspots. However, the specific 17 amino acid <lb/>substitutions evolved in the laboratory were not common in natural homologs suggesting that the <lb/>selection experiments had the resolution to predict where changes would evolve, but not the <lb/>exact change (Supplementary Figure 1). <lb/>Focusing in on the two residues critical for the OmpF + gain of function, 1012 and 1107, <lb/>we find that they alone are more variable than random pairs of sites in J (non-parametric <lb/>bootstrap: p = 0.00101) and the specificity region (non-parametric bootstrap: p = 0.036). But <lb/>what is more remarkable is the observation that in-frame indels are common in the regions <lb/>around sites 1012 and 1107 (Figure 2B; Supplementary Data 1). We measured indel variation <lb/>over J homologs using gap entropy: a two-state entropy counting each position in each aligned <lb/></body>

			<body>sequence as a gap or non-gap. Residues 1010-1013 and 1107-1109 have the highest gap entropy <lb/>in J, ranging from 0.799 to 0.893 out of a maximum of 1.000 (Figure 2B; Supplementary Data <lb/>2). For comparison, the typical amino acid site in the J alignment had no indels (mode and <lb/>median gap entropy = 0). That our experiments would correctly identify both regions with the <lb/>most natural indel variation by chance is extremely unlikely (given the size of each region and <lb/>the protein length (2× <lb/>$ <lb/>%%&amp;&apos; <lb/>× <lb/>&amp; <lb/>%%&amp;&apos; <lb/>) = 1.87×10 -5 ). Indels can have large beneficial effects on <lb/>proteins, including altering specificity by changing surface loops 14,17 , or causing structural <lb/>rearrangements that improve function 18 . <lb/>To analyze J protein evolutionary dynamics in more depth, we built maximum-likelihood <lb/>phylogenetic trees for J (Figure 2C) and its specificity region (Figure 2D). The trees are very <lb/>different (normalized Robinson-Foulds distance = 0.94 out of 1.00), indicating that recombination <lb/>has caused the history of the specificity region to differ from the history of the rest of the protein. <lb/>This means that the specificity region is an evolutionary module that commonly recombines and <lb/>circulates as a unit in the phage population. This observation supports the notion that this region <lb/>has elevated rates of evolution and diversification. <lb/>Using the second phylogeny, we calculated site-specific evolutionary rates for the <lb/>specificity region. The 17 residues studied in the MAGE experiments evolve faster than equally-<lb/>sized random samples taken from the specificity region (non-parametric bootstrap, p = 0.0067) <lb/>and residues 1012 and 1107 evolve faster than random pairs of sites sampled from the specificity <lb/>region (non-parametric bootstrap, p = 0.0073). <lb/>Together, the accelerated rate of change and increased entropy at residues 1012 and 1107 <lb/>suggest that these sites have experienced strong diversifying selection. Our combinatorial genetic <lb/>studies showed that these particular residues determine receptor tropism, so it is reasonable to <lb/>conclude that their unique evolution is due to host-range evolution. Mathematical theory has <lb/>demonstrated that receptor-use evolution should lead to diversification since accessing new host <lb/>types alters the phages&apos; ecological niches 19 . Indeed, diversification was observed in a related <lb/>experiment where l evolved to exploit two host cell types with different receptors 20 . To test <lb/>whether indels at 1012 and 1107 cause diversification, we compared the branches where indels <lb/>occur versus all others. If the indels cause ecological differentiation, then they should reduce <lb/>intraspecific competition for hosts and facilitate the long-term maintenance of distinct <lb/>evolutionary lineages. Indeed, the branches on which indels occur are significantly longer than <lb/></body>

			<body>the other branches of the specificity-region phylogeny (Kruskal-Wallis test, p &lt; 10 -8 ; visualized <lb/>by the discrete indel clades colored in lavender and light green in Figure 2D). <lb/>The congruence we find between laboratory and natural evolution in l contrasts with <lb/>work showing that beneficial mutations in Richard Lenski&apos;s long-term experiment anti-<lb/>correlate 21 with natural protein variation in E. coli. By design, Lenski&apos;s experiment lacks the <lb/>complex and variable selection pressures found in E. coli&apos;s natural gut environment, leading the <lb/>bacteria down evolutionary paths not taken in nature. By contrast, the dominant selection <lb/>pressure in evolution experiments with bacteriophage-attachment to bacterial host cells-is <lb/>probably also a dominant selection pressure on phage in the wild. Notably, another study on <lb/>experimental evolution of bacteriophage has observed residues under positive selection in both <lb/>the lab and nature 22 . <lb/>Together, these studies show that selection experiments on viruses cultured in the <lb/>laboratory can inform evolution in nature. Based on the patterns of J sequence variation <lb/>observed, we suggest that host-range evolution is common in this group of viruses, and perhaps <lb/>others too. While the frequency of host-range evolution may be unsettling, our work also <lb/>demonstrates potential methods to combat host shifts. In particular, worrisome mutations can be <lb/>identified with functional genetic experiments as described here or with other laboratory <lb/>techniques such as deep mutational scanning 23 . This information can be combined with genomic <lb/>surveillance efforts underway 24,25 to devise more effective disease management strategies to <lb/>eradicate problematic strains. <lb/>Methods <lb/>MAGE experiments <lb/>We modified λ strain cI857 (provided by Ing-Nang Wang, SUNY Albany) integrated into the <lb/>genome of HWEC106 (provided by Harris Wang, Columbia University). We engineered the J <lb/>substitutions into λ by using MAGE 15,26 on strain HWEC106. MAGE uses the λ-red <lb/>recombineering system provided on the pKD46 plasmid 27 .

			<body>For the first, 10-mutation library, we ran 18 rounds of MAGE and then screened for <lb/>OmpF + isolates. For the second library, we edited λ with oligos &apos;a3034g&apos; and &apos;g3319a t3321a&apos; to <lb/>introduce the canonical three mutations. Next, we performed a number of different MAGE trials <lb/>in order to maximize the number of unique alleles we observed. See Supplementary Table S2 for <lb/>our MAGE strategy. <lb/>To screen the edited phage for OmpF + genotypes, we induced the MAGE lysogen <lb/>libraries and plated the phage on lawns of lamB − E. coli strain JW3996 from the KEIO <lb/>collection 28 . Plaques were picked from the lawns and the C-terminus of the J gene was Sanger <lb/>sequenced at the Genewiz La Jolla, CA facility. Unpurified PCR products (Forward primer: 5&apos; <lb/>CGCATCGTTCACCTCTCACT; Reverse primer: 5&apos; CCTGCGGGCGGTTTGTCATTT) were <lb/>submitted. <lb/>Analysis of natural J variation <lb/>We used the evcouplings pipeline 29 to generate a jackhmmer 30 alignment of 1,207 full-<lb/>length J homologs (parameter settings: bitscore = 0.2 ; theta = 0.999; seqid_filter = 95 and 99 <lb/>(thresholds for filtering highly similar sequences); minimum_sequence_coverage = 99 (require <lb/>sequences to align to 99% of wild-type J protein); and minimum_sequence_coverage = 50. When <lb/>analyzing the specificity region (say, constructing a phylogeny), we used residues 960-1132 of <lb/>this full-length alignment. <lb/>We used RAxML 31 to generate maximum-likelihood phylogenies using automatically <lb/>selected amino acid substitution matrices (PROTGAMMAAUTO) based on model fit. To <lb/>account for recombination when estimating site-specific evolutionary rates in the specificity <lb/>region, we first ran a modified SBP algorithm 32 on the specificity region. We found a putative <lb/>recombination breakpoint at residue 1000, supported by Akaike&apos;s information criterion but not <lb/>the Bayesian information criterion. We therefore partitioned the specificity region at residue <lb/>1000 and re-calculated trees for each partition using FastTree 33 with an LG substitution matrix 34 . <lb/>We next calculated site-specific evolutionary rates with LEISR 35 , a scalable implementation of <lb/>Rate4Site 36 that accounts for recombination breakpoints, using an LG substitution matrix.

We divided the Robinson-Foulds distance (2276.00) <lb/>by its maximum possible value (2412.00) to get the normalized distance (0.94). <lb/>We calculated gap entropy at each position as: -[𝑝 ⋅ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 &apos; (𝑝) + (1 -𝑝) ⋅ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 &apos; (1-𝑝)], <lb/>where p is the frequency of gap characters at that position, and 1 -p is the frequency of all <lb/>amino acids at that position. <lb/>For all non-parametric bootstrap calculations, we used 100,000 bootstraps, and chose <lb/>groups of sites without replacement.

			<body>Supplementary Table S1 | Oligonucleotides (oligos) used to edit l genomes. Oligos were <lb/>designed slightly differently for the two libraries. For the first, we inserted a synonymous change <lb/>near each target. This was done as a silent tag to improve our confidence that an edit had been <lb/>made successfully. We did not do this for the second library because we found that all intentional <lb/>nonsynonymous changes were accompanied by the synonymous change. Additionally, for the <lb/>first library, when mutations fell within 90 bases, we designed a separate oligo for each possible <lb/>mutation combination. For the second library, we ordered a mixed pool of oligos synthesized that <lb/>had all combinations of the mutations. Asterisks indicate phosphorothioated bases. <lb/></body>
