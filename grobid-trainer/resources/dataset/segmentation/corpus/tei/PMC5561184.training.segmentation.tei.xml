			<body>In mammals, NCAM is the predominant carrier of PSA, a polymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid monomers. PSA <lb/>and its carrier NCAM play important roles not only during development, but also in adult central and periph-<lb/>eral nervous system by regulating cell interactions and by affecting synaptic activities and regeneration after <lb/>trauma 1-7 . PSA modulates the functions of NCAM and influences cell interactions by direct binding to histone <lb/>H1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), FGF-2 and MARCKS 8-11 . <lb/>Proteolytic processing of NCAM by different proteases at the cell surface modulates cell interactions, and <lb/>the resulting fragments influence several cellular events, such as neurite outgrowth 12-17 . We had found that <lb/>PSA-lacking and -carrying proteolytic NCAM fragments comprising the intracellular and transmembrane <lb/>domains as well as part of the extracellular domain enter the cell nucleus after their generation at the plasma <lb/>membrane 18, 19 . The PSA-lacking transmembrane NCAM fragment is generated by a serine protease at the plasma <lb/>membrane upon stimulation of cultured cerebellar neurons or NCAM-expressing transfected CHO cells with <lb/>surrogate ligands, e.g. function-triggering NCAM antibody, and reaches the cell nucleus via the endoplasmic <lb/>reticulum and cytoplasm in a calmodulin-dependent manner 18 . In the present study, we addressed the question <lb/>by which mechanisms and pathways the PSA-carrying transmembrane NCAM fragment is generated and reaches <lb/></body>

			<body>the nucleus. Our results show that generation and nuclear import of the PSA-carrying and PSA-lacking NCAM <lb/>fragments are mediated by different mechanisms. <lb/>Results <lb/>Generation of the nuclear PSA-carrying NCAM fragment involves MMP2 and MMP9. After having <lb/>shown that NCAM fragments with or without PSA enter the nucleus 18, 19 , we here tested whether these fragments <lb/>are generated and transferred to the nucleus by the same or different mechanisms. Since the PSA-lacking NCAM <lb/>fragment is generated by a serine protease , we first analysed whether the nuclear PSA-carrying NCAM fragment <lb/>derives from proteolytic cleavage by a serine protease activity. Hence, nuclear fractions were subjected to immu-<lb/>noblot analysis with PSA-specific antibody after treatment of cultured cerebellar neurons with a function triggering <lb/>NCAM antibody in the absence or presence of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, which inhibits the generation <lb/>of the PSA-lacking transmembrane NCAM fragment . The nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were enhanced after stimu-<lb/>lation with NCAM antibody in the absence and presence of aprotinin relative to the nuclear levels of non-stimulated <lb/>neurons (Fig. 1a,c), indicating that serine proteases are not involved in the generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM <lb/>fragment. Since in vitro and in vivo studies have shown cleavage of NCAM by MMP2 and MMP9 16, 17 , we deter-<lb/>mined whether these proteases are involved in the generation of the nuclear PSA-carrying NCAM fragment using <lb/>the broad range metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 or inhibitors specific for MMP2 and/or MMP9. In the presence <lb/>of either inhibitor, nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were not significantly enhanced by the NCAM antibody treatment <lb/>relative to the nuclear levels of non-stimulated neurons and in contrast to the enhanced levels observed after NCAM <lb/>antibody stimulation in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1b,c). Similarly, nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were increased by <lb/>stimulation with NCAM-Fc in the absence of inhibitors relative to Fc treatment, whereas no enhancement in nuclear <lb/>PSA-NCAM levels was observed after NCAM-Fc treatment in the presence of MMP2-, MMP9-or MMP2/9-specific <lb/>inhibitors (Fig. 1d). To substantiate that the nuclear PSA is indeed attached to the NCAM fragment that is gener-<lb/>ated by MMP2-and MMP9-mediated cleavage, we performed immunoprecipitations with PSA antibody using the <lb/>nuclear fractions from cultured cerebellar neurons after treatment with NCAM-Fc in the absence and presence of <lb/>MMP2 or MMP9 inhibitors and treated the immunoprecipitates with peptide-N-glycosidase F to remove N-glycans <lb/>including PSA. Levels of the major N-deglycosylated NCAM fragment were higher in immunoprecipitates from <lb/>neurons stimulated with NCAM-Fc in the absence of inhibitors than in those treated with Fc, whereas levels of the <lb/>N-deglycosylated NCAM fragment were not increased upon NCAM antibody stimulation in the presence of the <lb/>MMP2-or MMP9-specific inhibitors (Fig. 1e). <lb/>In summary, these results indicate that MMP2 and MMP9 are both involved in the generation of the <lb/>PSA-carrying NCAM fragment and that activation of these MMPs and generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM <lb/>fragment are triggered by binding of a surrogate NCAM ligand, e.g. NCAM antibody, and the homophilically <lb/>acting NCAM-Fc to PSA-NCAM. <lb/>The PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is generated at the plasma membrane and is transferred to <lb/>the nucleus via endosomes and the cytoplasm. Next, we addressed the question by which pathway the <lb/>PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is transported to the cell nucleus. To monitor the PSA-NCAM fragment on its <lb/>way from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, PSA-NCAM-expressing CHO cells were subjected to cell surface <lb/>biotinylation and treatment without or with NCAM antibody followed by subcellular fractionation. Thereafter, <lb/>biotinylated proteins were isolated from the fractions and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the PSA anti-<lb/>body. The levels of biotinylated PSA-NCAM in plasma membrane-enriched fractions were reduced after NCAM <lb/>antibody stimulation relative to the levels in fractions from non-treated cells, while the levels of biotinylated <lb/>cell surface-derived PSA-NCAM in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were enhanced after antibody treatment <lb/>(Fig. 2a), indicating that the PSA-NCAM fragment is generated at the plasma membrane and transported to <lb/>the nucleus via the cytoplasm. Since the PSA-lacking NCAM fragment is translocated to endosomes and the <lb/>endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after its generation at the plasma membrane 18 , we also tested fractions enriched in <lb/>ER or endosomes for the presence of biotinylated PSA-NCAM. No biotinylated PSA-NCAM was detectable in <lb/>ER-enriched fractions (Fig. 2a), while biotinylated cell surface-derived PSA-NCAM was found in a fraction show-<lb/>ing high levels of the late endosomal marker rab7 (Fig. 2b). These results indicate that the PSA-carrying NCAM <lb/>fragment is transferred to endosomes, but not to the ER after its generation at the plasma membrane. <lb/>Immunogold staining and electron microscopy revealed high levels of PSA-NCAM in oval or round late <lb/>endosome-like structures of ~100 to ~400 nm 20 and gold grain clusters in nuclei after NCAM antibody stimulation <lb/>(Fig. 2c). In contrast, PSA-NCAM was hardly detectable in endosome-like structures or nuclei of non-stimulated <lb/>neurons (Fig. 2d,e). However, clusters of PSA-NCAM were observed at the cell surface of non-stimulated neu-<lb/>rons, but not of neurons treated with the NCAM antibody (Fig. 2c,d). These results support the notion that the <lb/>PSA-NCAM fragment is translocated from the plasma membrane to the nucleus via endosomes. <lb/>By in vitro translocation assays 18, 21 we analysed whether the PSA-NCAM fragment is released from endo-<lb/>somes into the cytoplasm and imported from the cytoplasm into nuclei. Since calmodulin mediates the release of <lb/>the PSA-lacking NCAM fragment from the ER membrane into the cytoplasm and is required for the import of <lb/>this fragment from the cytoplasm into the nucleus 18 , we in parallel used a function-blocking calmodulin antibody <lb/>and the calmodulin inhibitor CGS9343B 18 to test whether the release of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment from <lb/>endosomes and the nuclear import of this fragment depend on calmodulin. To analyse the release from endo-<lb/>somes into the cytoplasm, a fraction enriched in endosomes was isolated from PSA-NCAM-expressing CHO cells <lb/>after cell surface biotinylation and NCAM antibody treatment and was incubated with a cytoplasmic fraction <lb/>from PSA-lacking NCAM-expressing CHO cells in the absence or presence of the calmodulin antibody or inhibi-<lb/>tor. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody against the endosomal cargo marker transferrin showed the intactness <lb/>of the endosomes after incubation and centrifugation (Fig. 3a). The samples were then subjected to ultracen-<lb/>trifugation followed by isolation of biotinylated proteins from the resulting pellets and supernatants as well as <lb/></body>

			<body>immunoblot analysis of the biotinylated proteins with the PSA antibody. In the presence of the calmodulin anti-<lb/>body or inhibitor, the PSA-NCAM levels in the supernatants were lower and the levels in the pellets were higher <lb/>than those in the absence of the calmodulin antibody and inhibitor (Fig. 3a), indicating that the calmodulin anti-<lb/>body and inhibitor blocked the release of PSA-NCAM from endosomes. In contrast to the calmodulin antibody, a <lb/>non-immune control antibody only slightly affected the release of PSA-NCAM from endosomes (Fig. 3b). These <lb/>results suggest that PSA-NCAM is released from the endosomal membrane in a calmodulin-dependent manner. <lb/>To investigate the import of PSA-NCAM from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, a cytoplasmic fraction was <lb/>isolated from cultured wild-type cerebellar neurons after NCAM antibody treatment and incubated with nuclei of <lb/>PSA-NCAM-lacking cerebellar neurons from NCAM-deficient mice in the absence or presence of the calmodulin <lb/>antibody. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were <lb/>subjected to immunoblot analysis with the PSA antibody. The PSA-NCAM levels in the supernatant and pellet <lb/>fractions in the absence of the calmodulin antibody were only slightly higher and lower, respectively, when com-<lb/>pared to the levels in the absence of antibody (Fig. 3c), indicating that the calmodulin antibody does not inhibit <lb/>the nuclear import of PSA-NCAM. Similarly, the calmodulin inhibitor and a non-immune control antibody also <lb/>did not affect the nuclear import of PSA-NCAM (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that the PSA-NCAM fragment is <lb/>imported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and that calmodulin plays no or only a minor role in this process. <lb/>The NCAM antibody-triggered generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment depends on <lb/>calmodulin and on the activation of the FGF receptor, PLC and PKC.

			<body>effector domain of MARCKS in the plane of the plasma membrane and since a synthetic peptide comprising the <lb/>effector domain (ED peptide) binds to PSA 9 , we investigated whether the MARCKS-derived PSA-binding peptide <lb/>triggers the generation of the nuclear PSA-carrying NCAM fragment. Thus, we treated cerebellar neurons with <lb/>the ED peptide and the ED control peptide, which does not bind to PSA. Relative to the nuclear PSA-NCAM <lb/>fragment level of non-treated cells, the nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were enhanced by treatment of neurons with <lb/>the ED peptide, but not by the ED control peptide (Fig. 4a). Quantification of the nuclear PSA-NCAM levels <lb/>from independent experiments revealed that the ED peptide-triggered increase of nuclear PSA-NCAM levels <lb/>(219 ± 36%; n = 8; p &lt; 0.005, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett&apos;s multiple comparison test) was very similar to the <lb/>increase triggered by the NCAM antibody (235 ± 58%; n = 11; p &lt; 0.001) (data not shown). This result shows that <lb/>the ED peptide triggers the generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment like the NCAM antibody. <lb/>Non-phosphorylated MARCKS, which is predominantly found at the plasma membrane, binds to calmodulin <lb/>and acts as a reservoir of &apos;inactive&apos; calmodulin 22, 23 . Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC leads to the release of <lb/>MARCKS from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and to the dissociation of calmodulin from MARCKS 23 . <lb/>To test whether phosphorylation of MARCKS and the subsequent release of calmodulin from MARCKS are <lb/>required for the generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment, we determined the level of phosphorylated MARCKS <lb/>as an indicator of the level of free &apos;active&apos; calmodulin in the cytoplasm. Relative to the level in non-stimulated <lb/>neurons, the levels of phosphorylated MARCKS were increased after stimulation with the NCAM antibody and <lb/>the ED peptide, but not with the ED control peptide (Fig. 4b). This result suggests that NCAM antibody and ED <lb/>peptide trigger the phosphorylation of MARCKS and the dissociation of calmodulin from MARCKS. <lb/>Since surrogate NCAM ligands trigger co-signalling with the FGF receptor which in turn activates PLC <lb/>and leads to activation of PKC 25 , we used inhibitors of the FGF receptor, PLC and PKC to analyse whether the <lb/>generation of the PSA-carrying fragment depends on activation of the FGF receptor, PLC or PKC. In the presence <lb/>of these inhibitors, nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were not enhanced by NCAM antibody or ED peptide treatment <lb/>when compared to the levels after treatment without inhibitors (Fig. 4c,d). These results indicate that the genera-<lb/>tion of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment by NCAM antibody and ED peptide depends on the activation of FGF <lb/>receptors and subsequent activation of PLC and PKC. <lb/>MARCKS sequesters phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 26-29 which is not only the substrate of <lb/>PLC, but also serves as a docking platform and substrate for activated PI3K. Since phosphorylation of MARCKS <lb/>by PKC leads to liberation of sequestered PIP2 and to activation of PI3K 30, 31 , we determined whether NCAM <lb/>antibody-and ED peptide-triggered generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment depend on the activation of PI3K <lb/>using an inhibitor of PI3K and found that the inhibitor blocked the generation of the nuclear PSA-carrying <lb/>NCAM fragment by either stimulation (Fig. 4c,d). <lb/>Given that the generation and nuclear import of PSA-lacking NCAM fragment depend on calmodulin and acti-<lb/>vation of fyn/fak , we investigated whether the enhancement of nuclear PSA-NCAM fragment levels by treatment <lb/>with NCAM antibody or ED peptide was blocked in the presence of the FAK or calmodulin inhibitor. The FAK <lb/>inhibitor had only a slight effect on the enhancement of nuclear PSA-NCAM levels by either stimulation (Fig. 4c,d). <lb/>In the presence of the calmodulin inhibitor, the nuclear PSA-NCAM fragment levels were not enhanced after <lb/>NCAM antibody stimulation when compared to the enhanced levels observed in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 4c). <lb/>However, enhanced nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were found in neurons after treatment with the ED peptide in the <lb/>presence of the calmodulin inhibitor (Fig. 4d). These results indicate that the activation of the fyn/fak pathway <lb/>is not required for the generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment and that calmodulin is required for the NCAM <lb/>antibody-triggered, but not for the ED peptide-triggered generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment. <lb/>NCAM antibody-induced generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment depends on NOS-mediated <lb/>signalling pathways, while ED peptide-induced generation depends on PLD-mediated sig-<lb/>nalling pathways. Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC not only triggers the release of calmodulin from <lb/>MARCKS but also contributes to activation of calmodulin-mediated signalling, such as activation of NOS 32, 33 . <lb/>Thus, we investigated whether the calmodulin-and PKC-dependent enhancement of nuclear PSA-NCAM frag-<lb/>ment levels by NCAM antibody depends on calmodulin-triggered activation of NOS. In the presence of the NOS <lb/>inhibitor, nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were not enhanced by NCAM antibody stimulation (Fig. 4c). In contrast, <lb/>enhanced nuclear PSA-NCAM levels were found in neurons after treatment with the ED peptide in the presence <lb/>of the NOS inhibitor (Fig. 4d). <lb/>To examine whether NCAM antibody treatment of neurons triggers NO synthesis, we determined the intra-<lb/>cellular NO levels. A strong increase in NO levels was observed in neurons after addition of the NCAM antibody, <lb/>whereas only a slight increase was observed when a control antibody was applied (Fig. 5a). These results indicate <lb/>that the NCAM antibody triggers the activation of NOS and generation of NO, suggesting that NO production is <lb/>required for the generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment by NCAM antibody treatment. <lb/>Since MMP9 is activated by NO via S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiols 34-36 , we tested whether enhanced NO <lb/>levels after NCAM antibody treatment would lead to enhanced S-nitrosylation of MMP9, which indicates the <lb/>without (no inhibitor) or with inhibitors of MMP2 (25 nM) or MMP9 (10 nM) and then treated with the ED <lb/>peptide (25 µg/ml) (e). Nuclear fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the PSA-specific antibody <lb/>or histone H3 antibody to control loading. Nuclear PSA levels were quantified by densitometry and normalized <lb/>to the histone H3 levels. Mean values with standard deviation from 3 independent experiments are shown for <lb/>the normalized PSA levels in treated cells relative to the PSA level of non-treated cells (set to 100%).

			<body>activation of this protease. To determine extracellular S-nitrosylation of MMP9, culture supernatants from <lb/>non-treated and NCAM antibody-treated cerebellar neurons were subjected to conversion of S-nitrosylated <lb/>cysteines into biotinylated cysteines followed by isolation and immunoblot analysis of biotinylated proteins using <lb/>a MMP9-specific antibody. A biotinylated MMP9-immunopositive band of approximately 80 kDa was detecta-<lb/>ble in the supernatant from NCAM antibody-treated neurons, but not in supernatant from untreated neurons <lb/>(Fig. 5b). Culture supernatants from non-treated and NCAM antibody-treated cerebellar neurons were also <lb/>subjected to immunoprecipitation using a MMP9 antibody and to immunoblot analysis with antibody against <lb/>S-nitroso-cysteine. An S-nitroso-cysteine-immunopositive band of approximately 80 kDa was only detectable in <lb/>the MMP9 immunoprecipitate from supernatants of NCAM antibody-treated neurons (Fig. 5c). These results <lb/>suggest that NCAM antibody enhances MMP9 activity via S-nitrosylation of MMP9. <lb/>Since the ED peptide triggers the generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment via calmodulin-and <lb/>NOS-independent pathways, we examined the ED peptide-induced generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment in <lb/>more detail. First, we examined whether the ED peptide triggers the cleavage of PSA-NCAM by MMP9 and MMP2. <lb/>After treatment with the ED peptide, nuclear PSA-NCAM fragment levels were not enhanced in the presence of <lb/>the MMP2 inhibitor, while the levels were enhanced in the presence of the MMP9 inhibitor (Fig. 4e), indicating <lb/>that the ED peptide triggers the activation of MMP2, but not MMP9. Since activation of PLD and generation of <lb/>phosphatidic acid by PLD regulate production and activity of MMP2 37, 38 , we asked whether the ED peptide triggers <lb/>PLD-dependent signal pathways to stimulate MMP2-mediated generation of the nuclear PSA-NCAM fragment. To <lb/>this aim, we treated neurons with ED peptide in the presence or absence of PLD inhibitor and found that this inhib-<lb/>itor blocked the generation of the nuclear PSA-NCAM fragment (Fig. 4d).

			<body>of PLD inhibitor on PSA-NCAM fragment levels were observed after stimulation with NCAM antibody (Fig. 4c), <lb/>indicating that the NCAM antibody treatment does not trigger the activation of PLD. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In previous studies, we showed that PSA-lacking and -carrying NCAM fragments enter the cell nucleus after their <lb/>generation at the plasma membrane 18, 19 . The PSA-lacking NCAM fragment is generated by a serine protease <lb/>and the translocation of this fragment from the plasma membrane via the ER and the cytoplasm to the nucleus <lb/>depends on calmodulin and the fyn/fak pathway . Here, we show that the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is <lb/>generated and transported to the nucleus via a pathway which differs from the pathway by which the PSA-lacking <lb/>NCAM fragment is generated and transported to the nucleus. Based on our results we propose the following <lb/>sequence of events triggered by NCAM and a surrogate ligand or by the MARCKS-derived ED peptide leading to <lb/>the generation and nuclear import of the PSA-NCAM fragment. Binding of NCAM or PSA ligands to the NCAM <lb/>protein backbone or the PSA glycan cause conformational changes and/or interfere with the interaction of <lb/>NCAM with the FGF receptor leading to activation of the FGF receptor (Fig. 6a,b). Changes in NCAM&apos;s structure <lb/>Figure 6. Proposed working model for the generation of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment. (a) PSA-carrying <lb/>NCAM interacts with the FGF receptor and the effector domain (ED) of non-phosphorylated MARCKS which <lb/>sequesters calmodulin to the plasma membrane. Binding of NCAM ligands to PSA-NCAM leads to dissociation <lb/>of the FGF receptor and PSA-NCAM and detachment of the PSA moiety from MARCKS followed by activation <lb/>of the FGF receptor, PLC, PKC, and PI3K. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS effector domain <lb/>triggers the release of membrane-bound MARCKS and dissociation of calmodulin from MARCKS. Free <lb/>calmodulin binds to NOS leading to activation of NOS and production of NO, which is released into the <lb/>extracellular space. S-nitrosylation of MMP-9 by NO leads to activation of MMP-9 and subsequent activation <lb/>of MMP2 and cleavage of PSA-NCAM by active MMP2. After cleavage, the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment <lb/>is internalized, transported to endosomes and released from the endosomal membrane into the cytoplasm <lb/>involving calmodulin and imported calmodulin-independently from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. (b) The <lb/>MARCKS-derived ED peptide like endogenous stimuli affects the interaction of the PSA moiety and MARCKS <lb/>and thereby not only triggers the dissociation of the FGF receptor and PSA-NCAM, the activation of the <lb/>FGF receptor, PLC and PKC and phosphorylation of the MARCKS effector domain, but also the activation <lb/>of PLD, which produces phosphatidic acid. Activation of PLD and production of phosphatidic acid may lead <lb/>to inhibition of calmodulin to activate NOS, but triggers the direct activation of MMP2 which cleaves PSA-<lb/>NCAM. <lb/></body>

			<body>and activation of the FGF receptor signalling pathway lead to activation of PLC, PKC and PI3K. PKC-mediated <lb/>MARCKS phosphorylation results in the dissociation of PSA from MARCKS, detachment of MARCKS from the <lb/>membrane, and liberation of calmodulin and PIP2 from MARCKS (Fig. 6a,b). Activated PI3K binds to liberated <lb/>PIP2 and produces the signal molecule PIP3 (Fig. 6a,b). Free calmodulin activates NOS and NO produced by <lb/>NOS is released into the extracellular space and stimulates the activation of MMP9 and MMP2 (Fig. 6a). Due to <lb/>the fact that MMP9 is activated by NO via S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiols 34-36 and our observation that MMP9 <lb/>is S-nitrosylated upon stimulation with NCAM antibody, it is likely that the attachment of NO to cysteine residues <lb/>of MMP9 leads to activation of this protease. Based on our results, we propose that NO-dependent activation of <lb/>MMP9 results in activation of MMP2 and that MMP2 cleaves cell surface full-length PSA-NCAM (Fig. 6a). <lb/>The MARCKS-derived ED peptide triggers MMP2-mediated and MMP9-independent cleavage of full-length <lb/>PSA-NCAM via activation of PLD which produces the signal molecule phosphatidic acid. Activation of PLD <lb/>depends on PIP3 which is produced from PIP2 by activated PI3K. Since the ED peptide binds to PSA within <lb/>the plane of the plasma membrane 9 , we suppose that this peptide interferes with the interaction of PSA and <lb/>MARCKS within the plane of the plasma membrane and thereby triggers PLD-dependent signal transduction <lb/>pathways leading to the generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment (Fig. 6b), suggesting that the generation of the <lb/>PSA-NCAM fragment can also be triggered by physiological stimuli which may affect the association of PSA <lb/>with MARCKS in the plasma membrane. Since the ED peptide-induced generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment <lb/>is calmodulin-and NOS-independent, it is likely that ED peptide-induced signalling leads to inhibition of the <lb/>calmodulin-induced activation of NOS and the subsequent NO-dependent activation of MMP9, probably by <lb/>phosphorylation of calmodulin which blocks NOS activation 39 (Fig. 6b). <lb/>After its generation, the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is translocated to the nucleus via the endosomal com-<lb/>partment and the cytoplasm. The release of the fragment from the endosomes into the cytoplasm is mediated by <lb/>calmodulin, while the nuclear import of the fragment is not mediated by calmodulin. <lb/>In summary, our results indicate that the generation of the PSA-carrying and PSA-lacking NCAM fragments <lb/>is mediated by different pathways and mechanisms in vitro. <lb/>Surrogate PSA-NCAM ligands, e.g. NCAM-Fc, NCAM antibody and the MARCKS-derived ED peptide, used <lb/>in the present study may mimic the functions of endogenous NCAM ligands and PSA ligands that trigger different <lb/>signal pathways leading to the generation and nuclear import of the PSA-carrying NCAM fragment in vivo. Since <lb/>soluble extracellular NCAM forms with and without PSA have been documented in the brain and cerebrospinal <lb/>fluid 40 , it is conceivable that soluble NCAM forms act as PSA-NCAM ligands in vivo besides other endogenous <lb/>ligands. Soluble NCAM forms with and without PSA may bind to the protein core of PSA-NCAM and thereby <lb/>trigger NO-dependent, MMP9-mediated generation of the PSA-NCAM fragment, while the PSA moiety of solu-<lb/>ble PSA-NCAM forms may interfere with the interaction of membrane-bound PSA-NCAM and MARCKS within <lb/>the plasma membrane and thereby triggers NO-independent, MMP2-mediated generation of the PSA-NCAM <lb/>fragment. Since NO regulates numerous processes in the nervous system including synaptic plasticity and con-<lb/>trol of circadian rhythm 41, 42 , NCAM-induced NO production may be involved in regulation of NO-dependent <lb/>processes. MMP2 and MMP9 which have numerous substrates play important roles in the nervous system during <lb/>development and in the adulthood as well as after injury and have been implicated in neurological disorders and <lb/>diseases . Thus, the activation of MMP9 and MMP2 through NCAM-induced signal pathways not only leads to <lb/>cleavage of NCAM but also to cleavage of other cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins and may contribute to <lb/>PSA-NCAM&apos;s role in regulation of processes in normal, injured or diseased developing and adult nervous system. <lb/>In this context it is important to mention that elevated levels of soluble NCAM have been found in brains or cere-<lb/>brospinal fluids of patients with Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia or medulloblastoma 40 , and that overexpression <lb/>of soluble extracellular NCAM in mice causes defects in synaptic connectivity and produces abnormal behaviour <lb/>relevant in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders 44 . Based on these findings it can be speculated that <lb/>the PSA-NCAM fragment upon import into the nucleus contributes to PSA-NCAM&apos;s functions in the developing <lb/>and adult nervous system. Since PSA participates in regulation of cell interactions during development, affects syn-<lb/>aptic activities and regeneration after trauma in the adult nervous system and is important in regulating the diurnal <lb/>internal clock 19 , it is likely that the generation and nuclear import of the PSA-NCAM fragment is required for these <lb/>PSA-NCAM-mediated functions. Moreover, dysregulated generation and altered nuclear levels of the PSA-NCAM <lb/>fragment may be involved in the development of neural disorders. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Animals and cell lines.
