			<front>Surface Molecular Self-Assembly for <lb/>Organophosphate Pesticide Imprinting in <lb/>Electropolymerized Poly(p-aminothiophenol) <lb/>Membranes on a Gold Nanoparticle Modified <lb/>Glassy Carbon Electrode <lb/>Chenggen Xie,* , † Huaifen Li, † Shanqi Li, † Ju Wu, † and Zhongping Zhang* , ‡ <lb/>Department of Chemistry and Life Science, West Anhui University, Lu&apos;an, Anhui 237012, P. R. China, and Institute of <lb/>Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui 230031, P. R. China <lb/>This paper reports a surface molecular self-assembly strat-<lb/>egy for molecular imprinting in electropolymerized polyami-<lb/>nothiophenol (PATP) membranes at the surface of gold <lb/>nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified glassy carbon (gc) electrode <lb/>for the electrochemical detection of pesticide chlorpyrifos <lb/>(CPF). Electropolmerizable p-aminothiophenol (ATP) was <lb/>first assembled on the AuNPs at the gc electrode surface <lb/>by the formation of Au-S bonds, and subsequently, the CPF <lb/>template was further assembled onto the monolayer of ATP <lb/>through the hydrogen-bonding interaction between amino <lb/>group and CPF. A conductive hybrid membrane was fabri-<lb/>cated at the assembled gc electrode by the electropolymer-<lb/>ization in a mixing solution containing additional ATP and <lb/>CPF templates, and meanwhile, the CPF was spontaneously <lb/>imprinted into the PATP/AuNP film. The amount of im-<lb/>printed sites at the PATP/AuNP film was significantly <lb/>increased due to the additional replenishment of CPF <lb/>templates. The cyclic voltammetric response of the im-<lb/>printed PATP-AuNP-gc sensor to CPF is about 3.2-fold as <lb/>compared with the imprinted PATP-Au sensor, and the <lb/>detection limit for CPF is about 2 orders of magnitude lower <lb/>than that by the imprinted PATP-Au sensor. An excellent <lb/>electrochemical selectivity for CPF over other pesticides was <lb/>also achieved. The combination of surface molecular self-<lb/>assembly with electropolymerized molecular imprinting on <lb/>a larger surface area of a AuNP-modified electrode produces <lb/>a high ratio of imprinted sites and, thus, provides an <lb/>ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of organophosphate <lb/>pesticide. <lb/></front>

			<body>Organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely used <lb/>in agriculture, household, and urban insecticide applications, <lb/>because of its high toxicity as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase <lb/>that is necessary for normal function of nervous system. 1 The <lb/>residue of CPF in agricultural products and the natural environ-<lb/>ment is extremely harmful to human health and zoology. Up to <lb/> now, various methods have already been proposed to assay CPF <lb/>and its metabolites by the use of complicated instruments such <lb/>as gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) <lb/>detection 2-4 and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry <lb/>(LC/MS). 5-7 However, these instrumental analysis are usually <lb/>expensive, time-consuming, and tedious, and require sample <lb/>pretreatment and highly trained technical personnel. On the other <lb/>hand, enzyme/antibody-based immunoassay has also been de-<lb/>veloped for the detection of organophosphate CPF 8-14 by the <lb/>readout of various electrochemical or optical transducers, such <lb/>as voltammetric response, 15,16 surface plasmon resonance (SPR), 17,18 <lb/>and optical approach. 19-21 Although a high sensitivity can be <lb/>achieved, the poor chemical/physical stability of the antibodies <lb/></body>

			<body>or enzymes prevents their use in the harsh environments of acids <lb/>or bases, organic solvents, and high temperatures. Accordingly, <lb/>it still remains a great challenge to develop a rapid, inexpensive <lb/>but sensitive method for the detection of CPF in environments. <lb/>Recently, numerous attempts have been made to replace <lb/>biological receptors with synthetic counterparts as a recognition <lb/>element in chemo/biosensors. Of various approaches, the mo-<lb/>lecular imprinting technique has become a powerful tool for the <lb/>preparation of polymeric materials that have the ability to specif-<lb/>ically bind a chemical species. 22,23 Molecular imprinting typically <lb/>involves the preassembly of template molecule and functional <lb/>monomer and the subsequent copolymerization with cross-linking <lb/>monomers. The removal of template molecules from the polymer <lb/>matrix generates the recognition sites (cavities) complementary <lb/>to the shape, size, and functionality of the template molecule. 24-29 <lb/>Because of mechanical/chemical stability, low cost, and easy <lb/>preparation, molecularly imprinted materials have widely been <lb/>used as sensitive components in chemical/biological sensors for <lb/>pesticide detection. 30,31 For the construction of the molecularly <lb/>imprinted polymer (MIP)-based sensor, the molecularly imprinted <lb/>membranes can be synthesized in situ at an electrode surface by <lb/>an electropolymerization technique 32 at the surface of gc <lb/>electrode, 33,34 gold electrode, 35,36 graphite electrode, 37 etc. It is <lb/>well-known that the sensitivity of the imprinted sensor is dictated <lb/>by the amount of effective imprinted sites on the sensor surface. <lb/>Although the amount of the imprinted sites increases with the <lb/>increase of the imprinted membrane thickness, thick imprinted <lb/>membranes can lead to slow diffusion of the analytes to the <lb/>recognition sites and to inefficient communication between the <lb/>binding sites and transducers. 38 To further increase the amount <lb/>of effective imprinted sites on the sensor surface, the simplest <lb/>method is to use a higher surface area electrode, 39 through the <lb/>assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) at the surface of <lb/>electrodes 40-43 due to its large specific surface area, good <lb/>biocompatibility, and high conductivity. 44 <lb/>Herein, we report a surface molecular self-assembly strategy <lb/>for molecular imprinting in electropolymerized aminothiophenol <lb/>(ATP) membranes at the AuNP-modified gc electrode for the <lb/>electrochemical detection of pesticide CPF. The combination of <lb/>surface molecular self-assembly with electropolymerization of ATP <lb/>on a larger area of AuNP-modified electrode was expected to <lb/>produce a high ratio of imprinted sites and to enhance the total <lb/>amount of effective imprinted sites. The electrochemical sensor <lb/>not only can strikingly improve the sensitivity and selectivity of <lb/>CPF analysis but also obtains good repeatability and, thus, can <lb/>be potentially exploited for the detection of pesticide residuals or <lb/>other deleterious chemicals in environment. <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>Reagents. Figure 1 displays the structural formulas of the <lb/>pesticide compounds used in this study. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) and <lb/>2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) were purchased from <lb/>Fluka. Other pesticides were kindly provided by Anhui Huaxing <lb/>Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. p-Aminothiophenol (ATP) was ob-<lb/>tained from Alfa Aesar. Tetarachloroaurate (III) acid (HAuCl 4 ) <lb/>and potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ) were purchased from <lb/>Shanghai Chemicals Ltd. Other reagents were commercially <lb/>available as analytical reagent grade and used without further <lb/>purification. Stock solutions of 1.0 × 10 -2 M pesticide were <lb/>prepared in acetonitrile and stored at 4°C in a refrigerator to <lb/>avoid exposure to light. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH <lb/>) 6.86, 0.05 M) was prepared from KH 2 PO 4 and K 2 HPO 4 with <lb/>doubly distilled water. KCl (0.1 M) was used as the supporting <lb/>electrolyte. <lb/></body>

			<body>Apparatus. Electrochemical measurements were performed <lb/>using an electrochemical analyzer LK98B∏ (Tianjin, China) <lb/>connected to a personal computer. A three-electrode configuration <lb/>was employed, consisting of a bare or modified gc electrode (2 <lb/>mm in diameter) as a working electrode and an Ag/AgCl/ <lb/>saturated KCl electrode and a platinum wire (1 mm in diameter) <lb/>as the reference electrode and auxiliary electrode, respectively. <lb/>Preparation of AuNP-gc Electrode. A gc electrode was <lb/>polished carefully to a mirrorlike surface with 0.3-0.05 µm of <lb/>alumina aqueous slurry and then successively washed in an <lb/>ultrasonic cleaner with water and ethanol. Prior to the deposition <lb/>of AuNPs, the bare gc electrode was cyclic-potential scanned in <lb/>the potential range -0.2 to +0.6 V in 0.01 M K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] solution <lb/>containing 0.1 M KCl supporting electrolyte until a pair of well-<lb/>defined redox peaks was observed. To electrochemically <lb/>deposit AuNPs on the surface of the gc electrode, the gc <lb/>electrode was immersed in 0.2 g L -1 HAuCl 4 solution and <lb/>treated by the use of a constant potential of -0.2 V for 60 s. 45-48 <lb/>After being cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and doubly distilled <lb/>water, the AuNP modified gc electrode (AuNP-gc) was immersed <lb/>in a fresh piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2 , 7:3) for about 5 min, <lb/>rinsed again with doubly distilled water, and finally dried under <lb/>nitrogen gas. Caution: The piranha solution is dangerous to <lb/>human health and should be used with extreme caution and <lb/>handled only in a small quantity. <lb/>ATP Modification and CPF Self-Assembly on a AuNP-gc <lb/>Electrode. ATP modification was carried out by methods that <lb/>were reported in the literature. 49-51 The pretreated AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode was immersed into a 10 mM solution of ATP in ethanol. <lb/>After a reaction period of 24 h at room temperature, the electrode <lb/>was taken out and rinsed with ethanol and water. Then, the ATP-<lb/>modified AuNP-gc electrode was immersed into a 1 mM solution <lb/>of CPF in acetonitrile for 6 h. The electrode was taken out, rinsed <lb/>with ethanol, and then dried under nitrogen flow at the room <lb/>temperature. CPF molecules accordingly assembled onto the ATP-<lb/>modified AuNP-gc electrode through hydrogen bond interactions <lb/>between the residual amino groups (-NH 2 ) of ATP and the <lb/>nitrogen/oxygen atom of CPF. <lb/>Preparation of Imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc Electrode. The <lb/>ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode with CPF assembly on the <lb/>electrode surface was immersed in the aqueous electrolyte <lb/>solution containing 5 mM ATP, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mM CPF, and 0.05 <lb/>M PBS (pH ) 6.86). After the solution was deoxygenated by <lb/>bubbling nitrogen gas for about 15 min, the electropolymerization <lb/>was performed by seven consecutive cyclic scans in the potential <lb/>range of -0.2 and +0.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s -1 . After the <lb/>electropolymerization, the polyaminothiophenol (PATP) mem-<lb/>brane modified AuNP-gc electrode (PATP-AuNP-gc) was rinsed <lb/>with 0.5 M HCl three times for 20 min each to remove the <lb/>CPF template. Then, the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>was rinsed with doubly distilled water and ethanol and dried <lb/>under nitrogen for further use. At the same time, the imprinted <lb/>PATP membrane modified gold (PATP-Au) electrode (2 mm <lb/>in diameter) was also produced under identical chemical <lb/>conditions. As a control, the nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode was prepared and treated in the same way except <lb/>that the template molecule was omitted from electropolymer-<lb/>ization stage. <lb/>Electrochemical Measurements. The imprinted PATP-AuNP-<lb/>gc electrode was dipped into 0.1 M KCl containing the desired <lb/>concentration of CPF for 10 min, washed with doubly distilled <lb/>water carefully to remove the possible adsorptive substances on <lb/>the electrode surface, and then transferred to the electrochemical <lb/>cell containing 0.05 M PBS (pH ) 6.86) and 0.1 M KCl as the <lb/>supporting electrolyte. Before electrochemical measurements, <lb/>the electrolyte solution was purged with nitrogen for 10 min. The <lb/>cyclic voltammogram was recorded between -1.0 and +1.2 V at <lb/>a scan rate of 100 mV s -1 . The electrochemical impedance <lb/>spectroscopy was scanned in 0.01 M Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-and 0.1 M <lb/>KCl solution at the formal potential of 0.25 V with a frequency <lb/>range of 1-10 5 Hz and a signal amplitude of 5 mV. All <lb/>measurements were performed at room temperature. <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Figure 2A illustrates the preparation procedures of the im-<lb/>printed PATP-AuNP-gc electrode. The preparation procedures <lb/>were summarized as three steps: electrodeposition of AuNPs on <lb/>the surface of gc electrode; electropolymerization of ATP on the <lb/>surface of AuNP-gc electrode; removal of the imprinting CPF <lb/>molecules from the imprinted PATP membranes. Prior to the <lb/>electropolymerization, the deposition of AuNPs was performed <lb/>on the gc electrode surface in the 0.2 g L -1 HAuCl 4 solution by <lb/>the use of a constant potential of -0.2 V. The deposition time <lb/>was used to control the amount of AuNPs on the gc electrode <lb/>for obtaining an adequate coverage of AuNPs on the gc <lb/>electrode surface. The ideal deposition time was determined <lb/>by measuring the voltammetric response of corresponding <lb/>electrodes in 0.01 M K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] and 0.1 M KCl solution. The <lb/>results showed that the redox peak currents of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-<lb/>were the strongest with the first 60 s deposition and then <lb/>decreased slowly with deposition time. Although the longer <lb/>deposition time could increase the amount of AuNPs on the gc <lb/>electrode surface, aggregations of AuNPs on the gc electrode <lb/>surface would decrease the surface area of AuNPs, leading to the <lb/>decrease of redox peak current of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-<lb/>. As illustrated <lb/>in Figure 2B, when the AuNP-gc electrode was immersed into a <lb/>10 mM solution of ATP in ethanol for 24 h at room temperature, <lb/>a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of ATP molecules was formed <lb/>on the AuNP surface by Au-S bonds between AuNPs and the <lb/>thiol groups (-SH) of ATP molecules. 49-51 The SAM of ATP can <lb/>serve as an initial polymerizable monolayer to improve the <lb/>&quot;wetting&quot; of the surface by the polymer, 52 which drives the <lb/>selective occurrence of electropolymerization at the surface of <lb/>AuNPs. <lb/>On the other hand, when the ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>was immersed into a 1 mM solution of CPF in acetonitrile for <lb/></body>

			<body>6 h. CPF molecules in solution phase could be assembled onto <lb/>the ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode through hydrogen bond <lb/>interactions between the residual amino groups (-NH 2 ) of ATP <lb/>and nitrogen/oxygen atom of CPF. The intermolecular interac-<lb/>tion between ATP and CPF could be confirmed by UV <lb/>absorbance spectra. The maximum absorption wavelength of <lb/>ATP slightly shifted to red wavelength in the presence of CPF, <lb/>and the maximum absorbance of ATP was also largely <lb/>increased with the addition of CPF (Figure 3). These suggest <lb/>the formation of hydrogen bond interactions between the amino <lb/>group (-NH 2 ) of ATP and the nitrogen/oxygen atom of CPF <lb/>in the solution system. Therefore, the strong hydrogen bond <lb/>interactions would drive CPF molecules to assemble onto the <lb/>surface of the ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode. These CPF <lb/>molecules assembled onto the ATP-modified AuNP-gc elec-<lb/>trode surface were embedded into the imprinted PATP mem-<lb/>branes and formed surface imprinted sites, which would <lb/>increase the amount of imprinted sites on the electrode surface <lb/>and enhance the sensitivity of the electrode. Our detailed <lb/>experiments also reveal that if the preincubation step was <lb/>omitted from the preparation procedures of the imprinted <lb/>PATP-AuNP-gc electrode, the cyclic voltammetric responses <lb/>to CPF would decrease to about 10%-20% under the same <lb/>experimental condition. <lb/>The imprinted PATP membranes were electrodeposited onto <lb/>the ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode surface in the 0.1 M KCl <lb/>solution containing 5 mM ATP and 0.1 mM CPF by the scanning <lb/>potential between -0.2 and +0.6 V for seven consecutive cycles <lb/>at a scan rate of 50 mV s -1 . Figure 4A shows representative cyclic <lb/>voltammograms for electropolymerization process of ATP on the <lb/>ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode surface in the presence of CPF. <lb/>The voltammetric behavior of ATP showed that it was an entirely <lb/>irreversible oxidation process. An oxidation peak of ATP was <lb/>clearly observed at a potential of 0.48 V on the first scan. Then, <lb/>the anodic peak current decreased slightly under a continuous <lb/>cyclic scan. Finally, the peak currents almost became stable after <lb/>a seven-cycle scan. Moreover, the oxidation peak potential of ATP <lb/>slightly shifted to more anodic potentials from 0.48 to 0.53 V. The <lb/>results indicate that electro-oxidation of the ATP monomer <lb/>occurred at the anode and the PATP membranes deposited onto <lb/>the surface of the AuNP-gc electrode. The decrease of the peak <lb/>current seems to be related with the continual formation of PATP <lb/>membranes that leads to the suppression of the voltammetric <lb/>response. The SEM image in Figure 4B confirms the formation <lb/>of PATP/AuNP membranes on the AuNP-gc electrode surface. <lb/>The rough surface provides a large surface area for the adsorption <lb/>of target species at the modified electrode. In addition, similar <lb/>cyclic voltammograms of the electropolymerization processes of <lb/>ATP on the AuNP-gc electrode surface in the absence of CPF <lb/>had also been observed. Meanwhile, there is not any difference <lb/>in the cyclic voltammograms obtained in the presence/absence <lb/>of CPF template, indicating that CPF does not exhibit any <lb/>electroactivity in the potential range chosen for the polymerization <lb/>and its structure was not electrochemically altered during elec-<lb/>tropolymerization. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>In order to confirm whether CPF molecules had been embed-<lb/>ded in the imprinted PATP membranes, cyclic voltammograms <lb/>of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode before and after the <lb/>removal of the imprinted CPF molecules as well as the nonim-<lb/>printed PATP-AuNP-gc electrode were, respectively, recorded in <lb/>the N 2 -saturated PBS containing KCl solution as supporting <lb/>electrolyte (Figure 5). Before the removal of the imprinting CPF <lb/>molecules, a very sharp and well-defined oxidation peak at ∼0.93 <lb/>V and two broad and small reduction peaks at ∼0.23 V and ∼-0.65 <lb/>V were clearly recorded with the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode (Figure 5a). However, the nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-<lb/>gc electrode only exhibited a broad and small reductive peak at <lb/>∼-0.70 V, and no oxidation peak at ∼0.93 V was observed in the <lb/>cyclic voltammogram (Figure 5c). Since the electrochemical <lb/>measurements were carried out in CPF-free solutions, it is clearly <lb/>confirmed that the strong oxidation peak (E pa ) ∼0.93 V) was <lb/>entirely due to the oxidation reaction of CPF molecules <lb/>embedded into the imprinted PATP membranes. From the <lb/>imprinting procedures used in this work, there are two types <lb/>of imprinted sites in the imprinted PATP/AuNP membranes. <lb/>First, CPF molecules were assembled onto the ATP-modified <lb/>AuNP-gc electrode surface in advance through hydrogen bond <lb/>interactions between the residual amino groups (-NH 2 ) of ATP <lb/>and CPF molecules, forming surface imprinted sites. Second, <lb/>CPF templates in the solution of the electropolymerization <lb/>precursors were further embedded inside the PATP/AuNP <lb/>membranes and formed interior imprinted sites because of the <lb/>formation of hydrogen bonds between the amino group (-NH 2 ) <lb/>of ATP and the nitrogen/oxygen atom of CPF in the solution <lb/>system. Therefore, the combination of surface molecular self-<lb/>assembly with the electropolymerization technique was ex-<lb/>pected to produce a high ratio of imprinted sites and to enhance <lb/>the total amount of effective imprinted sites. <lb/>Furthermore, the CPF embedded in the PATP membranes <lb/>could be efficiently removed from the PATP membranes by <lb/>rinsing with 0.5 M HCl solution three times for 20 min each. As <lb/>shown in Figure 5b, the characteristic oxidation peak of CPF <lb/>molecules disappeared completely after the rinsing process, and <lb/>the cyclic voltammogram became almost identical to that of the <lb/>nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode (Figure 5c). Therefore, <lb/>electrochemical polymerization of ATP can give rise to the <lb/>recognition sites complementary to the molecular shape, size, and <lb/>functionality of CPF molecules. <lb/>Obviously, in comparison with the voltammetric behavior for <lb/>the electropolymerization process of ATP (Figure 4A), no oxida-<lb/>tion peak at ∼0.48 V was observed in the cyclic voltammograms <lb/>of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode, and the nonimprinted <lb/>PATP-AuNP-gc electrode (Figure 5b,c, respectively). The results <lb/>indicate that the PATP membranes are difficult to be oxidized <lb/>under this experimental condition, which can effectively avoid an <lb/>interference with CPF signal and enhance sensitivity of CPF. Our <lb/>detailed experiments reveal that the pH of the solution has a <lb/>significant influence on the stability of the imprinted PATP <lb/>membrane. At more acidic and basic pH, there is a strong <lb/>background signal resulting from the PATP polymer in the scan <lb/>range, producing a strong interference with the CPF signal to <lb/>make the detection of the CPF signal difficult. Therefore, in this <lb/>work, the mixture solution of PBS (0.05 M, pH ) 6.86) and 0.1 M <lb/>KCl was used for all electrochemical experiments. <lb/>Figure 6A shows the cyclic voltammograms of K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] <lb/>at the bare gc electrode, AuNP-gc electrode, imprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc electrode, and nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc elec-<lb/>trode. The cyclic voltammogram at the bare gc electrode <lb/>showed a quasi-reversible redox reaction with the peak <lb/>potential difference (∆E P ) of 140 mV and the ratio of the peak <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>currents of about 1:1, respectively (Figure 6A, curve a). The <lb/>cyclic voltammetric peak currents increased after the AuNP <lb/>deposition onto the gc electrode surface (Figure 6A, curve b). <lb/>The peak current increase may be contributed to a small increase <lb/>of surface roughness and effective surface area. Meanwhile, the <lb/>anodic peak potential (E pa ) shifted to the negative direction <lb/>followed by the decrease in the peak potential difference (∆E P ). <lb/>The negative shift of anodic peak potential (E pa ) was due to <lb/>the electrocatalytic effect of the AuNPs, which lowered the <lb/>activation energy of electrochemical reaction and then facili-<lb/>tated the redox reaction of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-<lb/>/ 4-at the AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode. <lb/>Moreover, cyclic voltammograms were also employed to verify <lb/>the formation of the PATP membranes on the AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>surface. Curve c and d in Figure 6A showed the cyclic voltam-<lb/>mograms of the AuNP-gc electrode modified with the imprinted <lb/>PATP membranes and the nonimprinted PATP membranes under <lb/>the same condition. As expected, almost no electrochemistry <lb/>response could be observed with the nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-<lb/>gc electrode (Figure 6A, curve d). This is likely because electron <lb/>transfer was blocked by the PATP membranes which completely <lb/>covered the surface of the AuNP-gc electrode. However, after the <lb/>removal of template CPF molecules from the imprinted PATP <lb/>membranes, a pair of redox peaks was recorded as shown in Figure <lb/>6A, curve c. This suggested that cavities were produced in the <lb/>imprinted PATP membranes after the removal of template CPF <lb/>molecules. The porosity enhanced the diffusion of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-<lb/>through the imprinted PATP membranes and promoted the <lb/>redox reaction of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-on the electrode surface. In <lb/>comparison with the cyclic voltammogram of the AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode (Figure 6A, curve b), it can be found that the redox <lb/>peak potential difference (∆E P ) remarkably increased and the <lb/>redox peak currents evidently decreased. The results indicate <lb/>that the imprinted PATP membranes had assembled on the <lb/>AuNP-gc electrode surface and retarded the electron transfer <lb/>between the electrolyte and the electrode. <lb/>On the other hand, the electrochemical impedance spectros-<lb/>copy is an effective method for probing the features of a surface-<lb/>modified electrode. In the electrochemical impedance spectros-<lb/>copy, the semicircle portion at higher frequencies corresponds <lb/>to the electron-transfer limited process and the linear portion at <lb/>lower frequencies may ascribe to diffusion. The semicircle <lb/>diameter equals the electron-transfer resistance (R et ), which <lb/>depends on the dielectric and insulating features at the <lb/>electrode/electrolyte interface. 18,36,48 Curves a and b in Figure <lb/>6B showed the electrochemical impedance spectra of the bare <lb/>gc electrode and the AuNP-gc electrode, respectively. Almost <lb/>straight lines were exhibited, which were characteristic of a mass <lb/>diffusional limiting electron-transfer process. 53,54 The results show <lb/>faster electron-transfer kinetics of Fe(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-on the bare gc <lb/>electrode and AuNP-gc electrode. However, after the PATP <lb/>membranes were electrodeposited onto the AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>surface (Figure 6B, curve c and d), the impedances were <lb/>significantly enlarged and the semicircle diameters of the im-<lb/>printed PATP-AuNP-gc electrode and the nonimprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc electrode were about 923 and 2900 Ω, respectively. <lb/>These results indicate PATP membranes have the larger obstruc-<lb/>tion effect, which results in reducing electron-transfer rate or <lb/>increasing resistance to the flow of electrons. Furthermore, in <lb/>comparison with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of <lb/>the nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode (Figure 6B, curve d), <lb/>the semicircle diameters of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>(Figure 6B, curve c) was much less than that of the nonimprinted <lb/>APTP-AuNP-gc electrode. The reason may be that there were <lb/>large numbers of the imprinted cavities of CPF in the imprinted <lb/>PATP membranes, which enhanced the diffusion rate of Fe-<lb/>(CN) 6 <lb/>3-/4-through the PATP membranes and made it easier <lb/>for electron transfer to take place. <lb/>We tested the electrochemical response of the imprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc electrode to the CPF analyte by the comparison with <lb/>the bare gc, AuNP-gc, nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc, and im-<lb/>printed PATP-Au electrode. Figure 7 shows the cyclic voltammo-<lb/>grams of the bare gc, AuNP-gc, the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc, <lb/>nonimprinted PATP-AuNP-gc, and imprinted PATP-Au electrodes <lb/>to 6.0 × 10 -6 M CPF. The bare gc electrode exhibited a broad <lb/>and small reductive peak at ∼0.32 V and a very weak oxidative <lb/>peak at 0.87 V (Figure 7a), suggesting a bad sensitivity to CPF. <lb/>When the gc electrode was modified with the AuNPs, an obvious <lb/>oxidation peak of CPF at ∼0.98 V was observed (Figure 7b) due <lb/>to the large surface area and good electrocatalytic activity of <lb/></body>

			<body>AuNPs. After the imprinted PATP membranes were further <lb/>modified onto the AuNP-gc electrode surface, we clearly observed <lb/>a very strong and well-defined oxidation peak at ∼0.85 V and broad <lb/>and small reduction peaks at ∼0.03 V (Figure 7c). The anodic <lb/>peak current of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode is about <lb/>7.3-fold compared to that of the AuNP-gc electrode. Meanwhile, <lb/>the anodic peak potential shifted to more negative potentials from <lb/>0.98 to 0.85 V with the modification of the imprinted PATP <lb/>membrane, which may result from the catalytic activity of the <lb/>imprinted matrix to the oxidation of CPF entering in the imprinted <lb/>sites. With regard to the sensitivity of determination of CPF, the <lb/>oxidation peak at 0.85 V was selected for quantitative analysis <lb/>because this peak was the most separated and intense. <lb/>Moreover, the imprinted PATP-Au electrode exhibited a well-<lb/>defined oxidation peak at ∼0.94 V and broad and small reduction <lb/>peaks at ∼0.24 V in 6.0 × 10 -6 M CPF (Figure 7e). With a <lb/>comparison with the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode (Figure <lb/>7c), the anodic peak current was decreased greatly by ap-<lb/>proximately 3.2-fold and was accompanied by a positive shift of <lb/>90 mV in the anodic potential direction. On the other hand, there <lb/>was no anodic signal of CPF observed at the nonimprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc electrode (Figure 7d). These above comparisons suggest <lb/>that the much higher sensitivity to CPF by the imprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc electrode should be mainly attributed to two advantages: <lb/>(i) the AuNPs provide a conductive roughened surface and have <lb/>a good electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation reaction of <lb/>CPF and (ii) a high ratio of imprinted sites by the molecular self-<lb/>assembly greatly improves the enrichment of electrode to CPF <lb/>species in solution. <lb/>It is known that the amount of the imprinted PATP on the <lb/>AuNP surface strikingly influences the amount of CPF molecules <lb/>embedded into the PATP membranes. However, if the imprinted <lb/>PATP membranes are too thick, template molecules situated at <lb/>the central area of the PATP membranes cannot completely be <lb/>removed from the polymer matrix. Moreover, the imprinted sites <lb/>situated at the central area are difficult to access by target <lb/>molecules due to the high mass-transfer resistance. As a result, <lb/>thick imprinted polymer membranes would exhibit low binding <lb/>capacity, poor site accessibility, and slow binding kinetics. 27-29 <lb/>Thus, the formation of thinner polymer membranes on the <lb/>electrode surface is preferred to improve the sensitivity of the <lb/>imprinted membranes. 55 The thickness of polymer membranes <lb/>can easily be adjusted by controlling the number of cycles during <lb/>the electropolymerization process. Figure 8 shows the evolution <lb/>of the peak current of CPF oxidation at the imprinted AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode with different scanning cycles in the imprinting elec-<lb/>tropolymerization. The voltammetric response to CPF obviously <lb/>rises and reaches a maximum with the seven cycles and then <lb/>decreases with a further increase of cycle number. Therefore, <lb/>seven cycles can obtain a suitable membrane thickness to provide <lb/>the highest sensitivity to CPF analyte. <lb/>The accumulation step is usually a simple and effective way of <lb/>enhancing the sensitivity of the imprinted sensor. 56 After template <lb/>molecules were removed from the imprinted PATP membranes, <lb/>the imprinted PATP electrode was preconcentrated in a stirring <lb/>0.1 M KCl solution containing 6.0 × 10 -6 M CPF before <lb/>measurement. Figure 9 shows the change of the anodic peak <lb/>current with the preconcentration time. The anodic peak current <lb/>increased significantly with the increase of preconcentration time <lb/>at the initial stage, and a stable response was obtained after 10 <lb/>min, suggesting that the adsorption equilibrium was reached. <lb/>Thus, the preconcentration time of 10 min before the determina-<lb/>tion of CPF can obtain the strongest electrochemical response. <lb/>The selectivity of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode to <lb/>CPF was evaluated by testing its cyclic voltammotric responses <lb/></body>

			<body>in the presence of some possible interfering substances including <lb/>methyl parathion (MP), methamidophos (MA), triazophos (TAP), <lb/>cartap (CP), and 2,4-dDichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D), re-<lb/>spectively. The selectivity of the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc elec-<lb/>trode to CPF molecules was evaluated by calculating the peak <lb/>current ratio (I s /I 0 ), where I s and I 0 were anodic peak current <lb/>of CPF at 0.85 V in the present and absence of interfering <lb/>substances. As shown in Figure 10, a 10-fold excess of MP, MA, <lb/>TAP, CP and 2,4-D over CPF hardly causes the significant change <lb/>of peak current of CPF, in which peak current ratio only slightly <lb/>varied from 0.95 to 1.06. These results indicate that the imprinted <lb/>PATP-AuNP-gc electrode showed higher recognition selectivity <lb/>for CPF than for other pesticides. This may be explained by the <lb/>fact that the delicate recognition sites of CPF molecules in the <lb/>imprinted PATP membranes have the capability to recognize <lb/>target molecules, allowing the detection of CPF from a complex <lb/>matrix without separation. On the other hand, the reproducibility <lb/>of the measurements was evaluated by measuring the cyclic <lb/>voltammeric responses of 6.0 × 10 -6 M CPF at the same <lb/>imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode. The relative standard <lb/>deviation (RSD) for seven successive determinations is about <lb/>2.3%. The imprinted PTAP-AuNP-gc electrode was stored under <lb/>desiccated conditions at room temperature when not in use. <lb/>The lifetime of the imprinted electrode was investigated by <lb/>measuring the voltammetric responses for 6.0 × 10 -6 M CPF <lb/>every 3 days. The response of the imprinted electrode de-<lb/>creased to 90% after storing for 30 days, and 82% of the original <lb/>responses were retained after 90 days. Furthermore, our <lb/>detailed experiments reveal that the response of CPF at the <lb/>imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode hardly changed after the <lb/>imprinted electrode was used at least 50 times with subsequent <lb/>washing and measuring operations. <lb/>Figure 11 displays the cyclic voltammetric responses of the <lb/>imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc electrode to CPF after being precon-<lb/>centrated in CPF solution. The sharp and well-defined peak <lb/>current increased with CPF concentration. A calibration curve <lb/>between the anodic peak current at 0.85 V and the CPF concentra-<lb/>tion was exhibited in the inset of Figure 11. As can be seen, at <lb/>the high concentration range, the anodic peak currents tend to <lb/>be stable, indicating that the imprinting sites were almost occupied <lb/>by CPF molecules. A linear relationship between the anodic peak <lb/>current and CPF concentration was obtained covering the con-<lb/>centration range from 5.0 × 10 -7 to 1.0 × 10 -5 M; the linear <lb/>regression equation is I (µA) ) 26.80 + 10.93C (µM), with a <lb/>correlation coefficient of 0.9968. The detection limit is calcu-<lb/>lated to be 3.3 × 10 -7 M based on the 3σ of the blank signals. <lb/>However, with the imprinted PATP-Au electrode as a working <lb/>electrode, the linear range, the detection limit, and the standard <lb/>deviation for 1.0 × 10 -5 M CPF were 5.0 × 10 -5 M to 1.0 × 10 -4 <lb/>M, 2.5 × 10 -5 M, and 3.6% (n ) 7), respectively. Therefore, the <lb/>detection limit for CPF by the imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc <lb/>electrode is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that by <lb/>the imprinted PATP-Au electrode. Moreover, the proposed <lb/>method was utilized for the determination of CPF in environ-<lb/>mental water samples. The environmental water samples were <lb/>directly spiked with 6.0 × 10 -6 M in tap water. The results show <lb/>that the recoveries from the environmental water samples were <lb/>excellent and varied from 90.5% to 107.3%. Therefore, the <lb/>method may be applicable to detect CPF in the real environ-<lb/>mental water sample analysis without the pretreatment of <lb/>samples. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In this work, we have demonstrated a sensitive electrochemical <lb/>sensing protocol for the detection of organophosphate pesticide <lb/>Figure 9.

			<body>CPF by a surface molecular self-assembly strategy for electropo-<lb/>lymerized molecular imprinting at the AuNP-gc electrode. CPF <lb/>molecules assembled on the ATP-modified AuNP-gc electrode <lb/>surface were embedded into the imprinted PATP membranes and <lb/>formed surface imprinted sites. Meanwhile, the imprinted sites <lb/>were further replenished by CPF molecules in the electropoly-<lb/>merization precursor mixture. It has clearly been demonstrated <lb/>that the cyclic voltammetric response of the imprinted PATP-<lb/>AuNP-gc sensor is about 3.2-fold compared to that of the imprinted <lb/>PATP-Au sensor and that the detection limit for CPF by the <lb/>imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc sensor is about 2 orders of magnitude <lb/>lower than that by the imprinted PATP-Au sensor. Moreover, the <lb/>imprinted PATP-AuNP-gc sensor also shows specific recognition <lb/>selectivity for CPF molecules over other pesticides. Therefore, <lb/>this novel, facile strategy reported herein can be further expected <lb/>to fabricate various electrochemical sensors for detecting the <lb/>pesticide residuals and other environmentally deleterious chemicals. <lb/></body>
