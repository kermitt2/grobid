			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Corn, as a carbohydrates producer, is a strategic agricultural commodity. Currently, the demand for corn is rising <lb/>along with the increase of the population. In addition to human consumption, corn commodity is used as a food <lb/>ingredient for animals. Corn yields fluctuate depending on the season [1]. Fig. 1 displays the national corn production <lb/>trend line for 2010-2020. According to reference [2], the major cause of the decline in the overall amount of corn <lb/>production is the frequent conversion of agricultural land and the decline in land productivity per hectare. On the other <lb/>hand, the demand pattern for corn tends to increase throughout the year. According to the Ministry of Agriculture of <lb/>the Republic of Indonesia, more than 58% of the nation&apos;s corn demand is utilized for feed, with the remaining <lb/>percentage going toward food and other industrial uses [3]. Therefore, corn production as a strategic commodity needs <lb/>to be increased in line with increasing demand and population. Low productivity and ineffective production are some <lb/>of the problems facing corn farming [4]. Some of the issues in corn growing that lead to low output, as in [5], include <lb/>critical land status, inappropriate fertilization techniques, problems with food crop seeds, and problems with marketing <lb/>agricultural products. <lb/>Based on the issues listed above, strategies are needed to boost the harvesting of corn. Various studies related to <lb/>corn farming have been conducted. An artificial neural network model was used in reference [6] to estimate the <lb/>production of corn for the next few years. Meanwhile, the SALTMED model was used to analyse the effect of <lb/>fertigation applications on increasing corn productivity [7]. The possible effects of climate change on corn cultivation <lb/>were evaluated as in reference [8], using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) with the Decision Support <lb/>Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop module. An investigation into the effect of water systems on <lb/>corn farming was conducted as in reference [9]. It was discovered that reducing moisture and making a few minor <lb/>adjustments to the way irrigation is currently done can boost corn yields. Meanwhile, the development of a conceptual <lb/>model for corn farming was carried out by reference [10] using a system thinking approach. The authors developed a <lb/></body>

			<body>conceptual model that has some important information regarding internal and external factors that influence corn <lb/>productivity and production. Table 1 illustrates a comparison of previous research. <lb/>Fig. 1 National Corn Production (tons) in Indonesia 2010-2020 [1] <lb/>Several previous studies have conducted in-depth analysis of corn farming systems. However, the aspects of <lb/>causality and behavioral changes in the system over time are not considered. The corn farming system is far more <lb/>intricate due to a growing variety of individuals and their interactions [11]. Studying corn farming systems in detail <lb/>and depth can help in understanding the circle of interaction between actors and factors universally. Therefore, this <lb/>study intends to develop a model that supports the linkages between factors and capture the dynamics in the corn <lb/>farming system. System dynamics approach is a model-based decision support method that has been widely applied <lb/>to analyse nonlinear systems, with various interactions between elements in complex systems. A system dynamics <lb/>approach is quite effective in studying the elements of complex systems [12], [13]. This study aims to analyse the <lb/>behaviour and dynamics in corn farming to increase its productivity. A system dynamics approach was used in this <lb/>study because of its ability to generate insights into the complexity of structures and behaviours in corn farming, and <lb/>understanding how various factors influence each other. To facilitate the analysis of information flow in the model, <lb/>the model was broken down into three sub-models: corn demand, corn productivity, and farmer profit. After that, the <lb/>model was subjected to behavioral validity testing to validate the model. Then, multiple scenarios that might boost <lb/>corn productivity were created. <lb/>TABLE 1 <lb/>RESEARCH COMPARISON <lb/>Purpose <lb/>Reference [6] <lb/>Increase corn productivity to maintain consistency to supply demand and <lb/>reduce corn imports to a minimum <lb/>Reference [7] <lb/>Optimize their utilization for corn production by examining the impact of <lb/>various fertility levels on the yield of the crop based on three irrigation <lb/>frequencies <lb/>Reference [8] <lb/>Examining how water use and the output of maize under both full and <lb/>deficit irrigation are affected by climate change <lb/>Reference [9] <lb/>Optimizing irrigation methods and agronomic systems <lb/>Reference [10] <lb/>Developing a conceptual model (Causal Loop Diagram) to increase <lb/>environmentally friendly corn production <lb/>This Study <lb/>Explore the causal relationship and behavior of elements in corn farming <lb/>systems to increase productivity <lb/>In this study, we simulated two scenarios: the adoption of a drip irrigation system and the Farmer Field School <lb/>(FFS) program. In the first scenario, the use of drip irrigation system technology was proposed because it considers <lb/>the fact that this system is able to overcome the problem of prolonged drought [14]. In these situations, using a drip <lb/>irrigation system was a suitable option as corn farmers could increase water efficiency and conservation by <lb/>implementing drip irrigation technology. In the second scenario, the Farmer Field School program was proposed <lb/>because through this program, farmers will have improved knowledge on corn production. About 59% of farmers <lb/>were small farmers with land holdings of less than 0.5 ha. Because these farmers were often poorly educated, they <lb/>were not able to adopt advanced agricultural technologies [15]. Through the farmer field school program, farmers <lb/>would be equipped with the knowledge to make better input modifications, including dosage and application time <lb/></body>

			<body>[16]. By implementing these two scenarios, corn production was hoped to increase not only in terms of quantity but <lb/>also in terms of quality. <lb/>II. METHODS <lb/>This research applied a system dynamics approach to analyse the behaviour of complex systems in corn farming. <lb/>System Dynamics (SD) model was introduced by Jay W. Forrester in 1956 [12]. SD is an effective method to recognize <lb/>the connections and interactions between variables within a particular system. SD is a simulation technique for <lb/>evaluating decision-making. This research consists of several basic stages in the creation of a model of system <lb/>dynamics, namely: in-depth understanding of the corn farming system, determination of key variables and data <lb/>collection, conceptual model development, simulation model development, model testing, and policy scenario <lb/>formulation. <lb/>A. System Understanding <lb/>At this stage, we defined the problem along with the variables that have an important impact on the system. System <lb/>understanding is the stage where the modeler needs to properly understand the system to be modelled, including all <lb/>its constituent parts, their interrelationships, and its long-term operation. The system understanding stage in system <lb/>dynamics modeling is very important because it is a fundamental first step in designing and analysing a system. This <lb/>understanding helps modelers to understand system behavior and identify relationships between interrelated variables. <lb/>System understanding was done by exploring various related literature on corn farming. The literature can be in the <lb/>form of journals, books, theses, or online references related to both corn cultivation and system dynamics modeling. <lb/>Corn is a type of food crop that belongs to the grass family which is classified as a grain crop. Corn is widely <lb/>recognized by the population in Indonesia as it is the second staple food after rice. Apart from food, corn is also in <lb/>high demand as animal feed. Over 50% of Indonesia&apos;s total corn demand is used for animal feed [17]. The weather, <lb/>illnesses, pests, cultivation technology and management, agricultural regulations, innovations, and many other factors <lb/>can affect the final output of corn production in corn farming [18]. Meanwhile, corn productivity is strongly influenced <lb/>by land area, fertilizer, labour, pesticides, climate, and seeds [19]. In addition, handling during harvest and afterward <lb/>has an impact on both production quantity and quality. Large losses might result from harvesting and post-harvest <lb/>handling errors. Picking is the first step in the harvesting process, and this is referred to as harvesting. Post-harvest <lb/>handling refers to the processes involved in processing agricultural goods following harvesting [20]. <lb/>B. Determination of Key Variables and Data Collection <lb/>At this stage, key variables are determined to make it easier to interpret the corn farming system. The determination <lb/>of key variables requires the SD model to be divided into three sub-models: Corn Demand, Corn Productivity, and <lb/>Farmer Profit. This division was done to help understand the system better. Focusing on small parts of the system <lb/>allows for better understanding of the dynamics and interactions between these components. In addition, splitting the <lb/>model into sub-models is a common practice in the development of system dynamics models to improve efficiency, <lb/>understanding, and overall project manageability. Then, through a comprehensive literature review, key variables in <lb/>corn farming were assembled. The literature used as references to capture key variables related to corn farming were <lb/>[3], [6], [10], [19], [21], [22]. <lb/>The variables collected were classified into endogenous variables and exogenous variables (see Table 2). <lb/>Endogenous variables are those that represent internal characteristics of the system under study. Exogenous variables, <lb/>on the other hand, represent outside factors outside the system&apos;s control. Furthermore, data collection was carried out <lb/>on historical data which were used as input values and validation instruments in the model with the actual system. <lb/>Data collection as a validation instrument was performed based on data availability. Historical data was acquired from <lb/>the online websites of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and the East Java Agriculture Office. The data employed <lb/>as instruments to validate the model were Population, Corn Harvest Area, Corn Productivity, and Corn Production. <lb/>C. Conceptual Model Development <lb/>Conceptual model development was developed through Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). CLD is developed to <lb/>properly recognize the system&apos;s variables&apos; causal relationships. It is a crucial tool for replicating the system&apos;s feedback <lb/>mechanism [13]. CLD draws a system structure that describes the variables in the system, the nature of the causal <lb/>relationships between the variables, and the behavior of the loop interactions formed [23]. Each causal relationship <lb/>across variables is linked with an arrow and its polarity. Positive loops marked with the symbol &quot;+&quot; indicate the <lb/>behavioral qualities of the loop as reinforcing, while negative loops marked with the symbol &quot;-&quot; indicate the behavioral <lb/>properties of the balancing loop. Vensim PLE x64 software was used to construct the system dynamics model in this <lb/>study. Fig. 2 illustrates the CLD of corn farming in this study. <lb/></body>

In loop B1, an increase in the total population will result in an increase in the death rate. In contrast, an increase <lb/>in the death rate will result in a decrease in the total population. In loop R1, an increase in the total population will <lb/>cause an increase in the birth rate. Likewise, an increase in the birth rate will upsurge the total population. In loop B2, <lb/>increasing harvest land area increases land conversion. However, increasing land conversion will reduce the harvest <lb/>land area. In loop R2, increasing the harvest land area will increase total land expansion. Likewise, increasing land <lb/>expansion will increase the harvest land area. In loop B3, an increase in harvest land area will result in an increase in <lb/>corn production. An increase in corn production can increase the corn fulfillment ratio. Increasing the corn fulfillment <lb/>ratio will increase the total population. However, an increase in the total population will reduce the harvest land area <lb/>because an increase in population will increase the demand for land for residence. <lb/></body>

			<body>D. Simulation Model Development <lb/>Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) serves as the basis for simulation modeling. SFD depicts a more detailed system <lb/>structure than CLD. In SFD, information and material flows are distinguished and the importance of consistency of <lb/>units and dimensions throughout the diagram is emphasized [24]. Building SFD is based on the structure of CLD, but <lb/>in the SFD new components and information flows can be added, without changing the big picture of the system in <lb/>the CLD structure [23]. SFD can also display a timeline model, which refers to how the development of events in a <lb/>system is depicted on a timeline and how the time model is used to simulate system dynamics. Simulation of the corn <lb/>farming system was executed with a simulation time period of 15 years, ranging from 2006 to 2021. Historical data <lb/>and information used are based on the condition of the corn farming system in East Java Province, Indonesia. The <lb/>East Java Agriculture and Food Security Office and Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) websites were used to get the <lb/>statistics and information. Fig. 3 describes the SFD of the corn demand sub-model. In this sub-model, the population <lb/>and corn consumption need variables influence corn demand. The population variable is a cumulative variable that <lb/>describes the total population. The population increase and population decrease variables are called inflow and outflow <lb/>variables which represent the increase and decrease in total population. Population increase is influenced by several <lb/>variables, namely birth rate, immigration rate, corn fulfillment ratio, and total population. Meanwhile, population <lb/>decrease is influenced by the death rate, emigration rate and total population variables. <lb/>Fig. 3 Corn Demand Sub-model <lb/>Furthermore, in the SFD of the corn productivity sub-model, corn production is influenced by corn productivity <lb/>and harvest area. The corn harvest area is the portion of a crop that has been lifted after it has matured. Meanwhile, <lb/>corn productivity is a value that shows the average yield of corn production per unit area of corn plants in a certain <lb/>period. Corn production is a result of the influence of agriculture input factors such seeds, fertilizers, the availability <lb/>of irrigation, pesticides, and others. Fig. 4 shows the SFD for the corn productivity sub-model. The corn fulfillment <lb/>ratio variable is obtained from the division between the amount of corn production and corn demand. This is the <lb/>relationship between corn demand and corn productivity. <lb/>Switching to the farmer profit sub-model, the farmer&apos;s gross income is the result of multiplying productivity per <lb/>hectare for corn by the price of corn in the market. The greater the yield of corn produced per hectare, the greater the <lb/>farmer&apos;s gross income. Furthermore, based on gross income, farmers get a net profit based on the amount of cultivation <lb/>costs incurred. Corn production costs are determined by fertilizer costs, labor costs, land rental costs, equipment rental <lb/>costs, fuel costs, and seed costs [25]. Fig. 5 illustrates the SFD of the farmer profit sub-model. <lb/>E. Model Testing <lb/>After the simulation was carried out, verification and validation were also necessary to determine the model&apos;s <lb/>viability. Model verification needs to be carried out to ensure whether the model structure is correct both in terms of <lb/>dimensions and units. Verification in this study was carried out using features in the Vensim PLE x64 simulation <lb/>software. A model structure that is correct will display the result &quot;Model is OK.&quot;, while &quot;Units are OK.&quot; indicates that <lb/>the units used are appropriate. Once verified, the model structure proceeded to the model validation stage. The aim of <lb/>model validation was to compare the model&apos;s simulated behavior to the real system&apos;s actual behavior. It is crucial to <lb/>compare the output values generated by the simulation using the model with the output values obtained from the actual <lb/>system in this stage. As in [26], if the error rate (E1) and error variance (E2) are less than 5% and 30%, respectively, <lb/></body>

			<body>the model is considered valid. Testing was applied to several variables with a significant effect on corn farming and <lb/>based on the availability of data. Validation is performed using a formulation that considers error rate and error <lb/>variance as in [26]. Equations (1) and (2) are the testing equations for error rate and error variance. <lb/>1 = <lb/>100% <lb/>(1) <lb/>Where, = the mean of the simulation data, = the mean of the historical data. <lb/>2 = <lb/>100% <lb/>(2) <lb/>Where, <lb/>= the results of the simulation&apos;s standard deviation, <lb/>= the results of the historical data&apos;s standard <lb/>deviation. <lb/>Fig. 4 Corn Productivity Sub-model <lb/>Fig. 5 Farmer Profit Sub-model <lb/>F. Model Scenario Formulation <lb/>Scenario formulation is a planning strategy effort that reflects the future behavior of the system [27]. The process <lb/>of creating a scenario involves updating or adding feedback loops or model parameters, as well as introducing new <lb/></body>

			<body>parameters and feedback loops [28]. This stage can also be called the time forecast model which involves predicting <lb/>or forecasting the future state or behavior of the system dynamics. The process of utilizing historical data or known <lb/>parameters to project how a system will develop over time. To achieve the objective of increasing corn productivity, <lb/>two scenarios were formulated, namely: (1) a drip irrigation system implementation scenario; and (2) a farmer field <lb/>school program scenario. <lb/>III. RESULTS <lb/>A. Baseline Model <lb/>In this part, the simulation results of the basic SFD model of corn farming are presented. During the period from <lb/>2006 to 2021, corn productivity experienced a good upward trend. On aggregate, corn productivity increased by an <lb/>average of 3.06% per year. Based on the simulation results, the highest peak of productivity occurred in 2021 with a <lb/>productivity rate of 5.70 tons/hectare. Fig. 6 shows the simulation results of corn productivity in East Java. Increased <lb/>corn productivity is influenced by various variables such as the availability of irrigation systems, corn seeds, <lb/>temperature, fertilization, and pesticides. Meanwhile, the effects of rainfall, and the influence of corn pests and <lb/>diseases affect the accumulation of corn productivity. <lb/>Fig. 6 Simulation Results of Corn Productivity Base Model <lb/>B. Model Testing Results <lb/>Model verification, also known as model structure testing, is the initial test performed on the model. Fig. 7 depicts <lb/>the results of the model verification. In this verification, the Vensim software displayed the results &quot;Model is OK.&quot; <lb/>and &quot;Units are OK.&quot; indicating that the model structure was appropriate. After the model structure was verified, it was <lb/>then validated. Model validation was executed during the simulation period from 2006 to 2021. As mentioned in the <lb/>Methods section, historical data was acquired from the online websites of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and <lb/>the East Java Agriculture Office. The population, corn harvest area, corn productivity, and corn production were the <lb/>variables in this study that have been validated. Table 3 shows the results of model testing by considering the <lb/>evaluation of error variance and error rate. The validation results shows that the Population variable had an E1 value <lb/>of 0.21 and an E2 value of 4.41. Then the Corn Harvest Area variable had an E1 value of 3.61 and an E2 value of <lb/>29.14. Corn Productivity variable had an E1 value of 2.89 and an E2 value of 1.27. Finally, the Corn Production <lb/>variable had an E1 value and an E2 value of 0.04 and of 8.09 respectively. These results show that the error rate (E1) <lb/>and error variance (E2) values for the validated variables are below 5% and 30%. This proves that the model developed <lb/>can be said to be valid and has represented the real system. <lb/>C. Scenario Formulation Results <lb/>In this research, scenario simulations were run until 2035 to study the future behavior of the system. As previously <lb/>planned, the scenarios were formulated to increase corn productivity include the implementation of a drip irrigation <lb/>system and a farmer field school program. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 7 Model Verification Results <lb/>1) Drip Irrigation System Scenario <lb/>In 2019, 34006 hectares of agricultural land experienced drought in East Java, Indonesia -the largest compared to <lb/>other provinces such as Central Java (32809 hectares) and West Java (25416 hectares). This was due to the fact that <lb/>there was an extreme drought until the middle of the year [14]. This is also what disrupts the supply of corn production. <lb/>The use of a drip irrigation system is a very suitable solution for such conditions. Drip irrigation technology can help <lb/>corn farmers conserve water and improve utilizing water efficiently. Fig. 8 illustrates the drip irrigation scenario. <lb/>This scenario changes the irrigation effect variable in the corn productivity sub-model to a drip irrigation effect. <lb/>This will minimize water waste by distributing the water equally and straight to the root zone of the plant. When plants <lb/>receive the right amount of water based on their demands, their growth and productivity are enhanced [29]. The goal <lb/>of drip irrigation, which applies water in small amounts and continuously, is to keep soil moisture levels high enough <lb/>to meet plant water requirements. The results of the drip irrigation system implementation scenario can be seen in Fig. <lb/>9. <lb/>Based on the simulation results of the drip irrigation scenario, corn productivity, which initially had an average <lb/>productivity of 5.51 tons/hectare per year until 2035, increased to 6.07 tons/hectare per year until 2035. The increase <lb/>demonstrates that a 10.09% annual improvement in corn yield is projected under the drip irrigation scenario. <lb/>Meanwhile, the average corn production also increases to 7902769 tons per year. Meanwhile, in the no scenario <lb/>condition, the average corn production is 6987397 tons per year. This suggests an average 13.10% increase in corn <lb/>production under a drip irrigation system scenario. <lb/></body>

Through this initiative, farmers <lb/>can observe and learn firsthand how new technologies are applied both in terms of technology management and input <lb/>use [16], [30]. Over the past ten years, Farmer Field Schools (FFS) have been employed as an intensive training <lb/>method to promote awareness and the usage of ecologically friendly farming practices in many developing nations <lb/>[31]. Fig. 10 below is a scenario model from the Farmer Field School (FFS) program. In this scenario, we add a new <lb/>variable, namely the farmer field school effect. By implementing the FFS program, farmers will have sufficient <lb/>knowledge regarding how to use agricultural inputs efficiently and effectively, which will influence the use of <lb/>fertilizers and pesticides. Through this initiative, farmers receive training in the efficient management of corn farms <lb/>and the correct use of inputs. Fig. 11 is the result of the FFS program scenario. <lb/></body>

			<body>average corn production was 6987397 tons. After the farmer field school, the average corn production increased slowly <lb/>in 2013 to 8085923 tons. This indicates that a 16% average increase in corn production can be achieved by holding <lb/>farmer field schools. <lb/>IV. DISCUSSION <lb/>A technique called System Dynamics (SD), which is ideal for dealing with complicated dynamical systems and <lb/>nonlinear interactions, was used in the simulation of this study. Farming system is a complex system that has a <lb/>structure with predominant feedback complexity. The two presented scenarios in this study focus on increasing <lb/>productivity in corn farming. While the drip irrigation scenario focuses directly on productivity, the farmer field school <lb/>scenario focuses more on improving farmers&apos; understanding of better corn crop management to manage crop <lb/>productivity. <lb/>Drip irrigation scenario refers to the technique of applying water to plants formed from pipe lines that are usually <lb/>small in diameter. It sends the filtered water directly to the ground near the plants. An &quot;emitter&quot; transmitter, which is <lb/>the name of the water-transmitting mechanism on the pipe, releases many liters of water every hour [32]. By leveraging <lb/>this technology, farmers can maintain corn productivity [33], [34]. <lb/>Meanwhile, farmer field schools, integrating crop management, allows farmers to better customize inputs both in <lb/>terms of dosage and timing of application. Productivity gains are largely determined by differences in input use. To <lb/>ensure that farmers may buy agricultural inputs at a lower cost and can use the inputs as advised, the government must <lb/>establish a competitive input market. At the farm level, inadequate funding and low farmer education are key issues. <lb/>Therefore, both central and local governments should frequently provide technical help to farmers to encourage them <lb/>to grow their agricultural output. Such support could take the shape of increased access to tenable credit programs, <lb/>successful marketing techniques, instruction, extension, and a deeper comprehension of farmers [16]. <lb/>According to our findings, maintaining stable corn production involves maintaining corn productivity per hectare, <lb/>which is often influenced by many variables. Not only does a growing population raise the demand for corn, but it <lb/>also results in a reduction in harvested area since more people need more land to live on. Apart from that, the use of <lb/>plant inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides are also no less important. Fertilizers and pesticides that are used <lb/>excessively or do not match the required portions can cause water and soil pollution, which can disrupt corn <lb/>productivity. Therefore, several relevant stakeholders can consider the scenario that has been implemented, namely <lb/>by conducting training and counselling on the importance of the farmer field school program. This program is <lb/>necessary, because through the program, farmers are provided with technical knowledge related to crop management <lb/>such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides according to the required portions. Furthermore, it is crucial to adopt <lb/>agricultural technology, such as drip irrigation systems, so plants receive water and nutrients optimally, even during <lb/>the dry season. <lb/>V. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In this article, corn farming systems were analysed with the aim of increasing corn productivity. Corn productivity <lb/>is a complex system where various variables are interrelated within it. The amount of water available for irrigation, as <lb/>well as the amount of fertilizer, pesticide, and seed used, can all affect corn output. To achieve this goal, an SD model <lb/>of corn farming system was established. Furthermore, SD models were used to project future corn farming systems. <lb/>Data and information from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) website and the East Java Provincial <lb/>Agriculture and Food Security Office were used as the basis for analysis and input for model validation. SD model <lb/>development was carried out starting from conceptual model development (CLD), simulation model (SFD), to <lb/>scenario formulation. <lb/>It was known that the variables that influence corn production include the harvest area and the level of corn <lb/>productivity. Different inputs including seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, the availability of irrigation, and weather <lb/>conditions like rainfall have an impact on corn productivity. Furthermore, scenarios were formulated for the objective <lb/>of increasing corn productivity. The first scenario was the application of drip irrigation to increase and maintain land <lb/>productivity even during the dry season. The average corn productivity and production might increase by 10.09% and <lb/>13.10% annually under the drip irrigation scenario. The second scenario was the implementation of farmer field <lb/>schools -integrated crop management. This scenario has a higher yield increase because it emphasizes increasing <lb/>farmers&apos; knowledge in corn crop management. With the farmer field school scenario, the average corn productivity <lb/>can increase by 13% and the average corn production by 16% per year. Future research could expand the analysis by <lb/>considering the factor of corn products for food diversification strategies, animal feed needs, and bioethanol. <lb/></body>
