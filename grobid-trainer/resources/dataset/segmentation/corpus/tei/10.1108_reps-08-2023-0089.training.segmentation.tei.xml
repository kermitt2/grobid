			<front>A quantitative analysis of <lb/>cosmeceuticals: business service <lb/>quality and client satisfaction <lb/>Mariah C. Bond <lb/>School of Advanced Studies, University of Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona, USA <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Purpose -The purpose of the quantitative correlational research study was to determine the relationship, if <lb/>any, between the predictor variable, cosmeceutical business service quality, and the outcome variable, <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction, in the southeast region of the United States of America. Cosmeceuticals were <lb/>cosmetics and medications administered by estheticians. <lb/>Design/methodology/approach -Literature on business service quality and client satisfaction theories was <lb/>synthesized after extensive review. Quantitative research data were collected and statistically analyzed on the <lb/>following subscales of consumer satisfaction: general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, <lb/>communication, financial aspects, time spent with professionals and accessibility/convenience. The <lb/>hypotheses addressed the research question (RQ) of whether cosmeceutical business service quality affects <lb/>client satisfaction. The Cosmeceutical Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 18 (CCSQ-18), a web-based research <lb/>instrument, had strong reliability with a Cronbach&apos;s alpha of 0.84. The target population (N 5 50) included <lb/>randomly selected female cosmeceutical consumers in the southeast region of the United States of America. <lb/>The researcher did not digress from the detailed research protocol, instrumentation, data collection or data <lb/>analyses. Through the Likelihood Ratio (LR) chi-squared statistic (18) 5 65.35 and its associated probability, <lb/>Prob &gt; chi-squared 5 0.000, the researcher determined the predictor variable cohesively has a statistically <lb/>significant effect on the outcome variable. <lb/>Findings -Research results concluded that a significant relationship exists between cosmeceutical business <lb/>service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the southeast region of the United States of America. <lb/>Originality/value -The findings detailed in the results complimented the argument that, generally, business <lb/>service quality is important to consider, because good business is based on client satisfaction. <lb/>Keywords Cosmeceuticals, Customer satisfaction, Business service quality, Quantitative research, <lb/>Popular culture, Beauty industry <lb/>Paper type Research paper <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Growth in cosmeceutical sales and demand within the past ten years is associated with the <lb/>change in the popular beauty culture (Laham, 2020; Lee, 2016). Clients believe the <lb/>cosmeceutical services consumed would help increase self-image in comparison to popular <lb/>beauty standards (Laham, 2020). A continued success of esthetic businesses is contingent to <lb/>the business service quality of administering and facilitating the clients&apos; needs (Kumar and <lb/>Reinartz, 2018). There is little guarantee any degree of the cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality results in beauty consumer satisfaction (Laham, 2020). Globalization, brand <lb/>awareness, an increase in popular culture media exposure and the classic adage for <lb/>American women to look good and feel good has help fuel the rapidly growing cosmetic <lb/>market (Laham, 2020). <lb/></body>

			<body>The global cosmeceuticals market size is projected to grow from $83.60 billion in 2023 to <lb/>$155.80 billion by 2030 (McMullen and Dell&apos;Acqua, 2023). The American Academy of Facial <lb/>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS), the largest association of facial cosmetic <lb/>surgeons in the world, found 80% of all treatments performed by cosmetic professionals in <lb/>2022 were non-surgical procedures, predicting the cosmeceutical sector growing at a rate <lb/>almost double in comparison to the rest of the beauty industry (McMullen and Dell&apos;Acqua, <lb/>2023; Shehan et al., 2023). Cosmeceuticals are cosmetic formulations containing bioactive <lb/>ingredients known for their medical benefits. Cosmeceuticals, a combination of cosmetic <lb/>products and pharmaceuticals like Botox injections, anti-aging lotions and collagen creams <lb/>are generally more invasive than traditional cosmetics and must be professionally <lb/>administered through the service of a cosmeceutical business (Lee, 2016). Cosmeceutical <lb/>businesses are commonly known in the United States as an esthetic center or medical spa <lb/>(medi-spa; Laham, 2020). <lb/>There are known health and medical benefits, as well as an increase in satisfactory <lb/>appearance and self-image perceptions, from the consumption of cosmeceuticals (Laham, <lb/>2020). Client satisfaction ensures business profits and relates to client perceptions of the <lb/>business service quality (Olsen et al., 2014). A basic marketing practice for any business to <lb/>increase profits is to increase business sales. An increase in sales can be achieved through <lb/>favorable client satisfaction, therefore, the primary desire of the cosmeceutical business is to <lb/>maximize business profits through client satisfaction (Lee, 2016). Business and research <lb/>administrators alike have great concern in the continuous assessment of client satisfaction <lb/>(Lee, 2016). There is a dearth of literature on consumer satisfaction; however, little research <lb/>exists on the client satisfaction of cosmeceutical businesses (McMullen and Dell&apos;Acqua, 2023). <lb/>The researcher examined if a relationship exists between cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality and client satisfaction, because identifying the relationship between business service <lb/>quality, regarding client satisfaction, is imperative for cosmeceutical businesses to remain <lb/>competitive and achieve business success. <lb/>1.1 Background of the literature <lb/>Client satisfaction is not a novel business concept, although the notion has often been <lb/>overlooked (Baumann, 2014). During the 1950s development of the marketing era, clients <lb/>became the focus of businesses (Olsen et al., 2014). The concept of client satisfaction was <lb/>introduced as a marketing concept of business by Cardozo in 1965 (Ok et al., 2018). In the <lb/>United States, the cosmeceutical business market has increased in consumer consumption <lb/>and has undergone enormous market growth in value since the early 1990s (Baumann, 2014; <lb/>Bellad et al., 2017). Continuing well into the 2000s, cosmeceutical businesses mainly attracted <lb/>clients with the desire to purchase products such as anti-aging creams, hair removals and <lb/>facial cleansers (Kumar and Reinartz, 2018; Lee, 2016; Pandey and Sonthalia, 2019). <lb/>Since 2010, the growth in the United States population has increased the number of women <lb/>over the age of 40 (Cox et al., 2016). Cosmetic enhancements to obtain a more youthful <lb/>appearance have become increasingly common in current popular culture and have overcome <lb/>the barriers of being taboo (Monteverde, 2016; Pandey and Sonthalia, 2019). Public figures, <lb/>such as Kimberly Kardashian and her notoriously famous family, who as a family have <lb/>earned a combined net worth of over two billion dollars from branded sales of cosmetic and <lb/>beauty products alone, have set the beauty standards of popular culture. With audiences <lb/>reaching over 2 million viewers for over 230 episodes, the glamorous family openly <lb/>showcases beauty on the highly viewed reality television series Keeping Up with the <lb/>Kardashians (Monteverde, 2016; Wissinger, 2016). Each member of the Kardashian family is <lb/>candidly open about personal cosmetic enhancements and the consumption of cosmeceutical <lb/>products and services. <lb/></body>

			<body>Beauty consumers have found satisfaction in the trend of looking like a Kardashian, hence <lb/>the popular moniker, keeping up (Monteverde, 2016; Pandey and Sonthalia, 2019). <lb/>Cosmeceutical businesses employ a widely accepted popular culture beauty standard. <lb/>Through comparisons with other women, an esthetic business may use a woman&apos;s anxiety <lb/>over her appearance to market clients, boosting business sales and enhancing business <lb/>profits (Bellad et al., 2017; Griva et al., 2018; Wirtz and Ehret, 2017). Cosmeceutical businesses <lb/>may attract consumers who expect the cosmeceutical service would help better align one&apos;s <lb/>self-image with popular beauty standards (Milam and Rieder, 2016). The quality of service <lb/>provided by a business and the level of satisfaction with business service quality can become <lb/>the leading factor in a business&apos; success. <lb/>A focus on cosmeceutical client satisfaction requires a review of business service quality <lb/>(Bansal and Taylor, 2015). Business service quality is important to consider because to <lb/>facilitate good business, clients must be satisfied with the business service quality received <lb/>(Lang et al., 2023). The costly nature of cosmeceutical business service quality places high <lb/>emphasis on client satisfaction, leading to successful business. Marketers contend client <lb/>satisfaction is the most valuable tool a business can employ to drive an increase in sales and <lb/>profits (Lang et al., 2023; Peppers and Rogers, 2016). In business, the client is the most <lb/>important resource related to business performance. <lb/>For a cosmeceutical business, every business service is centered on the client (Lun et al., <lb/>2016). A cosmeceutical client feels satisfied when the esthetic business&apos; service quality meets <lb/>predefined expectations (Sivakumar et al., 2018). In business, the client is dissatisfied when <lb/>the service quality is lower than expected, whereas the client is satisfied when the service <lb/>quality is higher than expected (Sivakumar et al., 2018). Client satisfaction is a strong <lb/>marketing tool and value-added benefit for a business, often seen by clients as just as <lb/>important as the business products and services sold (Gupta et al., 2022; Lun et al., 2016). <lb/>Exceptional service quality is a key component of the cosmeceutical business and may even <lb/>be ultimately responsible for business survival and success (Kasiri et al., 2017). <lb/>The value of clients in the business realm emerged in the 1980s. It is important to <lb/>continuously research the clients&apos; satisfaction before, during and after consumption, because <lb/>variable business service qualities have remained prevalent (Kitapci et al., 2014). <lb/>As discovered in the literature, businesses consistent with client satisfaction display <lb/>greater business profits and accomplishments (Arslanagic-Kalajdzic and Zabkar, 2017; Griva <lb/>et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2022). Businesses satisfy clients to maintain client relationships, <lb/>increase sales and ensure productivity. Client satisfaction as a concept has been extensively <lb/>researched, as the success of any business is greatly dependent on the satisfaction level of the <lb/>business&apos; clients (Baumann, 2014; Ok et al., 2018). <lb/>Client satisfaction has been researched in various ways, from a standard of measure to a <lb/>correlation with other business processes (Olsen et al., 2014). Business research has led to <lb/>probable methods of determining client satisfaction, with business service quality as the lead <lb/>determinant (Oliver, 1980; Parasuraman et al., 1985). Client satisfaction is largely based on the <lb/>level of service quality of the business (Baumann, 2014; Galib and Paymaei, 2022; Kasiri et al., <lb/>2017). As evidence businesses are still discovering the facets of client satisfaction, research is <lb/>steadily being conducted in the field. To create satisfaction in clients, cosmeceutical <lb/>businesses need to conduct research to answer questions on how clients perceive business <lb/>service quality, before, during and after consumption (Bellad et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2022; <lb/>Lee, 2016). <lb/>1.2 Purpose <lb/>A prosperous 108 million cosmeceutical client base throughout the United States exists <lb/>(Feetham et al., 2018). A financial and performance of over $28 billion is at risk if <lb/></body>

			<body>cosmeceutical business service quality does not result in cosmeceutical client satisfaction <lb/>(Feetham et al., 2018; Meng and Pan, 2012). Little research focuses on the relationship between <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (Lee, 2016). The <lb/>problem is there is limited empirical evidence on what relationship, if any, exists between <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast <lb/>Region of the United States. Specifically, there is a gap in the literature on the relationship of <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (Olsen <lb/>et al., 2014). <lb/>The lack of empirical knowledge is an indication there is a considerable need for additional <lb/>research on the topic to establish the relationship between cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (Black, 2005; Lee, 2016). Client expectations <lb/>determine the level of satisfaction. For favorable satisfaction to be achieved, the <lb/>cosmeceutical client expectations with business service quality must remain consistent <lb/>with the service quality delivered by the cosmeceutical business (Baumann, 2014). Client <lb/>satisfaction with business service quality is the most important part of a business&apos; challenge <lb/>in building lasting consumer relationships (Baumann, 2014; Peppers and Rogers, 2016). To <lb/>remain lucrative in the beauty market, cosmeceutical business service quality must facilitate <lb/>the integration of cosmeceutical client satisfaction and expectations (Laham, 2020). <lb/>The purpose of the quantitative research study was to determine what relationship, if any, <lb/>exists between the predictor variable, cosmeceutical business service quality, and the <lb/>outcome variable, cosmeceutical client satisfaction, in the Southeast Region of the United <lb/>States. Research participants included female cosmeceutical consumers over the age of 18 in <lb/>the Southeast Region of the United States. Cosmeceutical clients&apos; responses to the <lb/>Cosmeceutical Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 18 (CCSQ-18) concerning the satisfaction <lb/>with cosmeceutical business service quality were used to determine results of the research. <lb/>The hypotheses and research questions (RQs) were the focus of the entire cosmeceutical <lb/>research study. As a RQ construct, the research study sought to determine what relationship, <lb/>if any, exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client <lb/>satisfaction. For the research study, correlative hypotheses were tested to determine what <lb/>relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical <lb/>client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the United States. The hypothesis and RQ <lb/>became the focus of the cosmeceutical research study. <lb/>2. Methodology and design <lb/>The research study used the quantitative methodology with a correlational research design. <lb/>Quantitative research encompasses significant issues where research aims to establish an <lb/>understanding of the assumptions identified in a given research study, a phase of hypothesis <lb/>formulation and discipline during the development of the research design (Black, 2005; <lb/>Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). To determine what relationship, if any, exists between <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction was the objective <lb/>of the quantitative correlational research study. A quantitative analysis was appropriate <lb/>because the research is led by theory that describes models, study instruments and <lb/>approaches to the topics of research, including descriptive data for demographics, sample <lb/>size and tests for data normality (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). In quantitative method designs, the <lb/>hypothesis analysis frames the study and the development of the RQs, which gives the <lb/>researcher more control over the study (Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014). <lb/>Correlational research designs aim to identify a relationship between sets of variables <lb/>(Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). Using technological resources, the relationship is computable <lb/>(Black, 2005; Konerding, 2016; Vogt, 2007). The quantitative correlational research included a <lb/>research instrument that enabled the study to benefit from the method design with an <lb/></body>

			<body>efficient use of statistics for data analysis (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). If a significant <lb/>relationship existed, the researcher could then determine the strength and direction of the <lb/>relationship (Sekaran and Bougie, 2016). Quantitative research with a correlational design <lb/>was the most suitable method to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the <lb/>variables, because it gives the researcher the opportunity to make deductions from the data <lb/>(Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007; Vogt et al., 2014). <lb/>The use of an appropriate research method was based on the objective and approach of <lb/>the research study and the evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of each method <lb/>(Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). Although a correlational research design was <lb/>the optimal choice for determining the relationship of the variables of the research study, <lb/>other research designs such as descriptive research, quasi-experimental research and <lb/>experimental research were also considered (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). Descriptive research <lb/>design&apos;s data collection is observational in nature and not an ideal choice because the <lb/>researcher&apos;s bias may negate the data&apos;s validity (Black, 2005; Vogt et al., 2014). A quasi-<lb/>experimental research design would not be beneficial because quasi-experimental research <lb/>design is used to determine the cause-effect relationship between research variables <lb/>(Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007; Vogt et al., 2014). Experimental research would not be valuable <lb/>because the design seeks to determine the cause and effect or manipulate variables (Black, <lb/>2005; Vogt, 2007; Vogt et al., 2014). <lb/>The survey instrument was the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire 18 (PSQ-18) in a <lb/>distinctive Likert format, choices denoted the degree of agreement each participant had on <lb/>the inquiry to assess client opinion of each item (Meng and Pan, 2012). The researcher <lb/>obtained permissions to use the PSQ-18, scoring tables and other instrumental figures, both <lb/>electronically and in print, as evidenced in the License for PSQ-18 Usage. Text used in the <lb/>PSQ-18 was altered to specify the specific business service setting of research interest <lb/>without losing any psychometric tested properties or strength (Marshall and Hays, 1994; <lb/>Rand Corporation, 2019). The research questionnaire, the Cosmeceutical CCSQ-18, is an <lb/>adaptation of the PSQ-18 with the text altered only for specification of the research. Along <lb/>with the survey questions, the CCSQ-18 presented demographic questions (categorical <lb/>variables) for age, income and racial identity. <lb/>Data collection for the study was administered online through SurveyMonkey™ as the <lb/>survey instrument to examine the cosmeceutical client satisfaction for cosmeceutical <lb/>business services received. The researcher used SurveyMonkey™, a self-service secured <lb/>online interface for users to input, create, deploy and analyze surveys, to input the CCSQ-18 <lb/>survey instrument with licensed permission for the quantitative research study. Data <lb/>analysis was completed using version 26 of the statistical testing software by IBM known as <lb/>the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014). <lb/>A correlational Point biserial model two-tail test was used to help the researcher reject or <lb/>approve the hypothesis in 95% reliability level (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand Corporation, <lb/>2019; Vogt, 2007). A 5% error and effect size of 0.50 was used in the research study (Black, <lb/>2005; Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand Corporation, 2019; Vogt, 2007; Vogt et al., 2014). <lb/>The quantitative correlational research study focused on business service quality and <lb/>consumer satisfaction. The theoretical basis for the research study is presented in the <lb/>framework. The hypotheses addressed the RQ of whether cosmeceutical company service <lb/>quality affects client satisfaction. Quantitative research data collected was statistically <lb/>analyzed against the following subscales of consumer satisfaction: general satisfaction, <lb/>technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with <lb/>professionals and accessibility/convenience. The CCSQ-18, a web-based research instrument, <lb/>had strong reliability with a Cronbach&apos;s alpha of 0.84. The target population (N 5 50) <lb/>included randomly selected female cosmeceutical consumers in the Southeast Region of the <lb/>United States. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.1 Methodology literature <lb/>A fundamental step of research a researcher faces is deciding between quantitative or <lb/>qualitative research methods. The choice is based on the decision of which data collection <lb/>method would answer the RQ (Black, 2005; Dzwigol, 2020; Vogt, 2007). In the Likert survey <lb/>design of a quantitative effort, options are offered for each question or statement (Joshi et al., <lb/>2015). The presented options represent the degree of agreement a research participant has on <lb/>each item of inquiry. The Likert design format allows participants to openly respond (Joshi <lb/>et al., 2015). With the efficient use of statistics for data analysis, the research instrument <lb/>enables the study to benefit from the quantitative method design. <lb/>In the quantitative method, the researcher is given more control over the study, and the <lb/>opportunity to make more deductions from the data collected (Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; <lb/>Gupta et al., 2022; Sekaran and Bougie, 2016). The quantitative method is best for the <lb/>exploration of perceptions to provide further insight into cosmeceutical client satisfaction <lb/>(Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). The assessment of cosmeceutical business <lb/>services and client satisfaction provides an opportunity for quantitative method research to <lb/>help determine whether a relationship exists between cosmeceutical business service quality <lb/>and client satisfaction (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). Quantitative research involves the use of <lb/>computational, statistical and mathematical tools to derive results (Dzwigol, 2020). Using a <lb/>questionnaire as the research instrument, the study can benefit from the quantitative method <lb/>with a correlational design (Black, 2005; Marshall and Hays, 1994; Vogt, 2007). <lb/>Quantitative data is associated with functioning in the deductive research approach <lb/>against a hypothesis to be tested (Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). Quantitative <lb/>methods focus on a statistical assessment of numerical and scientific data to establish <lb/>relationships that may exist between variables (Black, 2005; Dzwigol, 2020; Oliver, 2014). <lb/>Sarstedt et al. (2022) posited that although quantitative data is focused on statistical <lb/>components, business research benefits significantly from the data and statistics discovered. <lb/>Sarstedt et al. (2022), described quantitative as being used principally to describe all parts of <lb/>the data collection process. The research instrument in a true Likert format, the PSQ-18, was <lb/>tested and proven to be strong in reliability and validity (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Sarstedt <lb/>et al., 2022; Valdes et al., 2021). <lb/>Valdes et al. (2021) conducted a review of periodical articles to determine whether <lb/>careful consideration of measurement goals can be encompassed using the PSQ-18.

(2018) <lb/>determined the selection of the most appropriate scale is dependent upon the purpose of the <lb/>research, the setting of the research, the scope of the research and the allotted time for the <lb/>research. In quantitative research conducted by Ng and Luk (2019) satisfaction surveys <lb/>were administered to patients to determine satisfaction with quality and to pinpoint <lb/>possible opportunities for quality improvement. The researchers determined the <lb/>instrument to have great reliability and validity to precisely function in the collection of <lb/>the patient&apos;s feedback on service quality (Ng and Luk, 2019). The PSQ-18 has been selected <lb/>to assess client satisfaction in various settings, but no study has assessed cosmeceutical <lb/>client satisfaction. <lb/>Merk and Michel&apos;s (2019) study, &quot;How to measure satisfaction with the service quality of <lb/>luxury beauty salons,&quot; used a quantitative non-experimental descriptive-correlational design <lb/>to measure service quality and customer satisfaction. The study used primary data from <lb/>respondents at six beauty salons, with each salon having a quota of 50 customers to rate. The <lb/>study employed a convenient sampling technique and mean (μ x ) to measure the level of <lb/>service quality and customer satisfaction. The purpose of the study was to identify the <lb/>determinants of client satisfaction and the characteristics of service quality favored by <lb/>luxury salon clients (Ajitha and Sivakumar, 2017). When factor analysis was executed on <lb/>sixteen variables, the researcher determined four preferred service quality characteristics <lb/></body>

			<body>based on customer support, service, relations and communication (Herhausen et al., 2019). <lb/>Responsiveness was found to be most influential concerning client satisfaction in comparison <lb/>with other characteristics (Mori and Lee, 2019). A significant relationship between luxury <lb/>salon service quality and client satisfaction was determined. The luxury salon services were <lb/>assessed, which differs from the business service quality in the administration of <lb/>cosmeceutical products. <lb/>Even though the general topic was an area of research like Merk and Michel&apos;s (2019) <lb/>study, different aspects and variables within the domain of cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality were assessed. A focus on different geographic regions, customer demographics <lb/>and specific components of business service quality led to additional constructs. <lb/>A variation in the correlational research design and statistical analyses used helped to <lb/>contribute to the existing literature. The current research incorporated variables to offer <lb/>an avenue for exploring the intricate dynamics shaping customer perceptions and <lb/>experiences within the cosmeceutical industry. Differences in industry trends between <lb/>luxury beauty salons and the cosmeceutical industry, regulatory environments of each, <lb/>basic consumer preferences and the competitive landscape emphasized the insights of the <lb/>findings and indications of the current research. <lb/>Correlational research involves the determination of the degree of association between <lb/>quantitative research variables. In correlational research, variables are not manipulated or <lb/>controlled like variables are in an experimental design (Bell et al., 2018). The most appropriate <lb/>methodology to describe and measure the degree of association between cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality (the predictor variable) and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (the <lb/>outcome variable) was a quantitative, correlational design. <lb/>Correlational designs search for relationships between variables (Vogt et al., 2014). If a <lb/>relationship exists, the researcher can gather data about the strength and direction of the <lb/>relationship (Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). With evidence of a significant <lb/>correlation between variables, some statistical inferences can be made to provide answers to <lb/>the RQ and test the hypotheses (Bell et al., 2018; Vogt et al., 2014). Results also produced <lb/>descriptive data for demographics and sample size, tests for data normality and independent <lb/>t-tests (Jeon, 2015; Levine et al., 2017). The statistical tests were used to determine what <lb/>relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and client <lb/>satisfaction. <lb/>Studies based on a correlational design uses variables the researcher is unable to control. <lb/>Even though the variables are not manipulated as in an experimental design, a correlational <lb/>research study is a chance to recognize the relationship among the research variables <lb/>(Jeon, 2015; Levine et al., 2017). In correlational research, the research concepts are defined in <lb/>terms of the variables. The correlation statistic is used to describe or measure the relationship <lb/>between two or more variables or sets of scores (Black, 2005; Jeon, 2015; Levine et al., 2017; <lb/>Vogt, 2007). The research studied the relationship between cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality (i.e. the predictor variable) and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (i.e. the outcome <lb/>variable) while incorporating an understanding of theory. <lb/>Quantitative research using a correlation design involves statistical measurement instead <lb/>of an experimental manipulation of variables (Black, 2005; Jeon, 2015; Vogt, 2007). <lb/>A correlational design allows the researcher to identify relationships or predictive <lb/>relationships which may exist between the variables (Jeon, 2015; Levine et al., 2017). The <lb/>goal of the presented correlational research was to determine the relationship, if any, existing <lb/>between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction (Jeon, <lb/>2015; Levine et al., 2017). In the research study, a primary objective included examining and <lb/>evaluating the variables in the research to determine what relationship, if any, exists between <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast <lb/>Region of the United States. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2 Theoretical framework <lb/>The theoretical basis for the research study was the expectancy disconfirmation theory (EDT) of <lb/>satisfaction (Oliver, 1980; Oliver, 2014; Williams, 2015). The EDT, developed by Oliver (1980), <lb/>served as the underpinning theory in examining the constructs of customer or client satisfaction. <lb/>One of the most accepted theories of client satisfaction is the EDT (Oliver, 1980; Williams, 2015). <lb/>EDT considers client satisfaction as an outcome of the gap between the client&apos;s expected and <lb/>perceived business service quality performance (Arslanagic Kalajdzic and Zabkar, 2017; Oliver, <lb/>1980). Applying the theory to the present research study aided in understanding the <lb/>relationship, if any, between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client <lb/>satisfaction for clients in the Southeast Region of the United States because the constructs of <lb/>business service quality were assessed for client satisfaction (Bellad et al., 2017; Lee, 2016). <lb/>High-quality service can lead to high levels of client satisfaction, which in turn facilitates <lb/>an increase in business sales and performance (Kumar and Reinartz, 2018). The EDT of <lb/>satisfaction is based on the needs and wants of business clients (Oliver, 2014; Williams, 2015). <lb/>According to the interpretations of business researchers, client satisfaction is a sense <lb/>occurring after the client evaluates what was expected to what was received from a product <lb/>or service. Client satisfaction occurs when the client assesses whether the business service <lb/>has met perceived needs and expectations (Olsen et al., 2014; Parasuraman et al., 1985). <lb/>Business clients perceive service quality as favorable when expectations are met or exceeded <lb/>(Olsen et al., 2014; Parasuraman et al., 1991). As displayed in Figure 1, Oliver (2014) believed a <lb/>consumer will only choose a product or service expected to provide the most satisfaction with <lb/>the consumer experience. <lb/>To better understand the relationship between cosmeceutical business service quality and <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction, the relationship between the constructs in the research <lb/>study was explained by using the Oliver (1980) satisfaction and service quality model. Oliver <lb/>(1980) defined the difference between pre-consumption and post-consumption expectations <lb/>and pre-consumption and post-consumption observed performance as disconfirmation. <lb/>A positive disconfirmation is the result of the client&apos;s observed business service performance <lb/>exceeding pre-consumption expectations (Oliver, 1980; Oliver, 2014; Parasuraman et al., <lb/>1991). In contrast, a negative disconfirmation is the result of the observed business service <lb/>performance failing to meet 16 pre-consumption expectations. Theoretically, in a cohesive <lb/>manner, expectation and disconfirmation conjointly produce a measure of client satisfaction. <lb/>2.3 Research questions/hypotheses <lb/>As the fundamental principle of a research study, the RQ framed the study, determined the <lb/>methodology and defined all phases of analysis and reporting (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). As a <lb/>RQ construct, the study sought to determine the relationship, if any, between cosmeceutical <lb/>Figure 1. <lb/>Simplified expectation <lb/>disconfirmation model <lb/></body>

			<body>business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction. A cross-sectional <lb/>questionnaire was administered to women in the Southeast Region of the United States to <lb/>address the following RQ. <lb/>RQ. What relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the United States? <lb/>For the research study, correlative hypotheses were tested to determine the relationship, <lb/>if any, between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction <lb/>in the Southeast Region of the United States (Black, 2005; Burns et al., 2014; Vogt, 2007). <lb/>The research study tested the following null hypothesis. <lb/>H0. There is no significant relationship between cosmeceutical business service quality <lb/>and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the United States. <lb/>The alternative hypothesis is: <lb/>H1. There is a significant relationship between cosmeceutical business service quality <lb/>and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the United States. <lb/>For the research study, the variables were defined as. <lb/>Variable 1. The predictor variable, cosmeceutical business service quality, was <lb/>categorized as prepaid beauty services and represented the integrated working of the <lb/>ten service quality determinants. <lb/>Variable 2. The outcome variable, cosmeceutical client satisfaction, was measured by the <lb/>PSQ-18 and represented the cosmeceutical client&apos;s satisfaction with cosmeceutical <lb/>business services received (Rand Corporation, 2019). <lb/>2.4 Data analysis <lb/>Data analysis applied the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software to <lb/>statistically assess what relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical business services <lb/>quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction. First, a correlation Point biserial model two-tail <lb/>test was used at 95% reliability level and 5% error to specify the impact or non-impact of each <lb/>questionnaire sub-category (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Parasuraman et al., 1985; Vogt et al., <lb/>2014). The two-tail test was used to help the researcher reject or approve the hypothesis in <lb/>95% reliability level, 5% error and effect size of 0.50 (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand <lb/>Corporation, 2019; Vogt, 2007). A priori analysis was used to compute the required sample <lb/>size. While the noncentrality parameter output was 3.741657, the critical t was 2.021075, the <lb/>df was 40, the total sample size was 42, and the actual power was 0.954528. <lb/>The SPSS helped to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the research study&apos;s <lb/>variables. In the case of the research study, the predictor variable was the cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality, and the outcome variable was cosmeceutical client satisfaction. The <lb/>CCSQ-18 inquiry items were asked in a way an indication of agreement reflected satisfaction <lb/>with services, while other inquiry items were asked in a way disagreement reflected <lb/>dissatisfaction with services (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand Corporation, 2019; Vogt et al., <lb/>2014). Rand Corporation (2019) explained how the PSQ-18 produces separate scores for each of <lb/>seven different subscales: General Satisfaction (Items 3 and 17); Technical Quality (Items 2, 4, 6 <lb/>and 14); Interpersonal Manner (Items 10 and 11); Communication (Items 1 and 13); Financial <lb/>Aspects (Items 5 and 7); Time Spent with Professionals (Items 12 and 15); Accessibility and <lb/>Convenience (Items 8, 9, 16 and 18) as shown in Table 1. <lb/>The conventional way to analyze a Likert scale instrument, such as the CCSQ-18, is to find <lb/>the sum of each selection and determine a score for each value (Joshi et al., 2015; Vogt et al., <lb/></body>

			<body>2014). Responses from each of the 18 items of the CCSQ-18 are coded 1-5 from strongly agree <lb/>to strongly disagree. In the CCSQ-18, negatively worded questions are reverse scored (1 5 5, <lb/>etc.) so in all cases a low score indicated satisfaction (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand <lb/>Corporation, 2019). Determined scores represent specific traits which are used in the data <lb/>analysis of the research, and the scores were useful for determining a research participant&apos;s <lb/>opinion of the perceived satisfaction (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand Corporation, 2019; Vogt <lb/>et al., 2014). After item scoring, items within the same subscale were averaged together to <lb/>create the seven subscale scores as shown in Tables 1 and 2, and the scores could then be <lb/>analyzed and depicted on a chart of the distribution of opinions across the population <lb/>(Marshall and Hays, 1994). <lb/>The descriptive statistics defined a depiction of the results to determine if a relationship <lb/>exists, while inferential statistics determined the strength and direction of the relationships <lb/>(Jeon, 2015; Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007; Vogt et al., 2014). A correlation in the same direction is <lb/>referred to as a positive correlation, meaning if one variable increases the other also increases <lb/>(Jeon, 2015; Vogt, 2007). More so, when one variable decreases the other also decreases (Jeon, <lb/>2015; Vogt, 2007). In a negative correlation, the variables move in the inverse, or the opposite, <lb/>direction as one variable increases, the other variable decreases (Jeon, 2015; Vogt, 2007). In an <lb/>effort of more in-depth data exploration, the researcher cross-tabulated the means of <lb/>contributing service quality factors (Marshall and Hays, 1994). <lb/>3.

			<body>reporting an income of $41,000-50,000, 22% reporting an income of $51,000-60,000, 16% <lb/>reporting an income of $61,000-70,000 and 14% reporting an income of $71,000 and above. <lb/>An initial analysis to test the assumption that the research data is normally distributed <lb/>was performed on the research data. From the data represented in the table, the researcher <lb/>found the data is normally distributed. A normal distribution was determined because the <lb/>absolute numbers for positive kurtosis and skewness were low. In addition, the absolute <lb/>numbers for the negative skewness and kurtosis were not very high. The mean, standard <lb/>deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the variables are displayed in Table 4. <lb/>As a first approach to determine the existence of a relationship between cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction, the estimated results of <lb/>Pearson&apos;s chi-squared test were used. According to the coefficient and the level of statistical <lb/>significance, the results are mostly consistent for each item. Through the results, the <lb/>alternative hypothesis can be accepted for each item except for I have to pay more for my <lb/>cosmeceutical services than I can afford, I have some doubts about the ability of the <lb/>cosmeceutical professionals who service me and I find it hard to get an appointment for <lb/>cosmeceutical services, whose level of significance is greater than 0.05. However, the test only <lb/>provides valuable information in which it is determined if there is a relationship, and it is not <lb/>possible to know whether this is positive or negative and the expected effect by including <lb/>Pearson&apos;s chi-squared test analysis. The results presented in Table 5 compare Items 2 <lb/>through 18 against Item 1 to determine the relationship. <lb/>To determine whether there is a significant relationship between cosmeceutical business <lb/>service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the United <lb/>States, an estimate of an ordered probit model was used to determine the influence of the <lb/>categorical variables corresponding to the responses to items of the CCSQ-18. The model is <lb/>expressed in the functional form: <lb/>y i * ¼ x 0 <lb/>i β þ μ i <lb/>The predictor variable y * is the measure of the observed quality of service for each individual <lb/>i. The variable x represents the matrix of the predictor variables and β as the vector of the <lb/>estimated coefficients of the model. Finally, μ is presented as the error term for each <lb/>individual i. According to the pseudo-R 2 of the model, it is considered that there is a good fit of <lb/>the model with a 0.626 for 50 observations. Through the Likelihood Ratio (LR) chi-squared <lb/>statistic (18) 5 65.35 and its associated probability, Prob &gt; chi-squared 5 0.000, the <lb/>researcher determined the predictor variable cohesively has a statistically significant effect <lb/>on the outcome variable, which indicates the correct specification and validity of the model. In <lb/>further evaluation, it was observed that Item 2 and Item 3 are not statistically significant with <lb/>a p-value greater than 0.05. However, Item 4 is significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), and the estimated <lb/>coefficient indicates the existence of a negative relationship with cosmeceutical business <lb/>service quality. Table 6 presents the results, which reflect different effects depending on the <lb/>CCSQ-18 items. Observations reveal that Item 5 also presents a statistically significant <lb/>p-value, but the variable has a positive relationship with cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality. Item 4, Item 7 and Item 14 are also negatively related to the other variables, whereas <lb/>Item 17 has a positive association. <lb/>Finally, the income level of the participants was included and was determined to be <lb/>statistically significant, given a p-value of less than 0.05. According to its estimated <lb/>coefficient, a positive relationship with the variable is observed; that is, at a higher level of <lb/>income, there is a greater probability that there is a better degree of cosmeceutical client <lb/>satisfaction. Although some variables had a p-value greater than 0.05 and were not <lb/>significant, it is possible to determine that the sign of each coefficient can provide an intuition <lb/>of the expected effect. Nonetheless, the evidence shows that there is a positive and negative <lb/></body>

			<body>cosmeceutical client satisfaction. Relationships among cosmeceutical clients&apos; perceived <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality satisfaction through a self-reported research <lb/>questionnaire, the Cosmeceutical CCSQ-18. This research study is unique because the <lb/>measure applied to assess the relationship existing between cosmeceutical client <lb/>satisfaction and cosmeceutical business service quality consists of a research <lb/>instrument that has been deemed valid and reliable across a multitude of previous <lb/>research settings. Before the present research study, minimal empirical evidence linking <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality with cosmeceutical client satisfaction was <lb/>discovered. Consistent with the hypothesis set forth in the study, the results from this <lb/>study indicate that a significant relationship exists between the predictor variable, <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality, and the outcome variable, cosmeceutical client <lb/>satisfaction, in the Southeast Region of the United States. <lb/>The research findings remain consistent with previous research, which revealed that <lb/>consumer satisfaction is based upon and directly related to the service quality determinants <lb/>and the disconfirmation theory of customer satisfaction (Herhausen et al., 2019; Marshall and <lb/>Hays, 1994; Oliver, 2014; Parasuraman et al., 1985, 1991). Research results from evaluating the <lb/>RQ presented in the current study indicate that cosmeceutical business service quality is <lb/>significantly related to cosmeceutical client satisfaction. Specifically, research results from <lb/>studies conducted by Ramya et al. (2019) revealed that the more favorable business service <lb/>quality was perceived, the more clients were satisfied, which was affirmed through the <lb/>findings of the current cosmeceutical research. The findings directly support the arguments <lb/>of Hill and Alexander (2017) who believed client satisfaction is one of the most critical issues <lb/>faced by businesses of all types. Although the relationships between business service quality <lb/>and consumer satisfaction have been researched in past research, the introduction of <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction facets is innovative to the industry literature. <lb/>The research results did not reveal any data to support the arguments of Kumari and <lb/>Khurana (2013), who believed the cosmeceutical sector has a raised competitive advantage over <lb/>the cosmetics industry. However, the results supported previous literature stating the <lb/>cosmeceutical business&apos; focus has been on remaining unique through providing favorable <lb/>service quality and not just selling cosmetic products (Lee, 2016; Bellad et al., 2017). Being <lb/>innovative with operations and strategies has made the cosmeceutical market what it is today, <lb/>and the research results have helped determine favorable business service quality and have <lb/>helped push the market forward. In addition, the results did not reveal any data to support <lb/>women use cosmetics to change the appearance of age or to appear sexier (Walker et al., 2021). <lb/>Variable <lb/>Coef <lb/>Std.

			<body>More importantly, the research results revealed data in opposition to the Walker et al. (2021) <lb/>argument women do not consider the use of cosmetics as favorable. <lb/>The research findings clearly support the arguments of Kumar and Reinartz (2018), who <lb/>posited business leaders should constantly seek opportunities to apply technical knowledge, <lb/>skills, abilities and proficiency to improve business service quality to create consumer <lb/>satisfaction. Research assessing client satisfaction in the cosmeceutical market is significant, <lb/>because with the proper strategic response, the twofold goal of cosmeceutical businesses <lb/>satisfying clients and generating business success may be accomplished (Bellad et al., 2017). <lb/>4. Conclusions <lb/>Beauty consumers have interest in the trend to look like a Kardashian-hence the popular <lb/>moniker, keeping up (Monteverde, 2016). Through a research design which business <lb/>administrators and industry leaders have had a long interest in understanding, the study <lb/>explores the problem of client satisfaction. The purpose of the quantitative correlational <lb/>research study was to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the predictor <lb/>variable, cosmeceutical business service quality, and the outcome variable, cosmeceutical <lb/>client satisfaction, in the Southeast Region of the United States. Cosmeceutical business <lb/>service quality, the predictor variable, was categorized as prepaid beauty services. <lb/>Cosmeceutical client satisfaction, the outcome variable, which occurs after the client <lb/>evaluated what was expected to what was received from a product or service was measured <lb/>by the CCSQ-18 (Konerding, 2016; Marshall and Hays, 1994; Olsen et al., 2014; Rand <lb/>Corporation, 2019). The significance of the study was based on the increasing global <lb/>cosmeceuticals market valued at $83.60 billion in 2023 (Cosmeceuticals Market, 2023; <lb/>McMullen and Dell&apos;Acqua, 2023). The global cosmeceuticals market is projected to reach <lb/>around USD 155.80 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about <lb/>8.09% from 2023 to 2030 (Cosmeceuticals Market, 2023). The nature of the study used the <lb/>quantitative method with a correlational design, with a theoretical basis as the EDT of <lb/>satisfaction (Bellad et al., 2017; Oliver, 1980). <lb/>Research participants included female cosmeceutical consumers over the age of 18 in <lb/>the Southeast Region of the United States. The RQ probed what relationship, if any, exists <lb/>between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction in <lb/>the Southeast Region of the United States. With the results detailed, a correlational Point <lb/>biserial model two-tail test helped the researcher reject or approve the hypothesis in 95% <lb/>reliability level, 5% error and effect size of 0.50 (Marshall and Hays, 1994; Rand <lb/>Corporation, 2019). <lb/>The recommendation is made for cosmeceutical businesses to improve brand loyalty <lb/>through personalized customer experiences, while for consumers, identifying high-quality <lb/>products and services is key. Focus was put on presenting practical insights that businesses <lb/>can readily implement, such as optimizing online engagement strategies or enhancing <lb/>employee training programs. The engagement of stakeholders throughout the research <lb/>process was valuable and further research may include conducting interviews with industry <lb/>professionals and hosting workshops to gather input and disseminate findings. This <lb/>collaborative approach will ensure the research resonates with stakeholders and has a <lb/>meaningful impact on the cosmeceutical industry as a whole. <lb/>The research findings are aligned with the disconfirmation theory of satisfaction <lb/>concepts. The disconfirmation theory of satisfaction emphasizes consumer perceived quality <lb/>with each of the business service quality determinants (Oliver, 1980). The main takeaway <lb/>from the results of the research study is a significant relationship between cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction exists, hence key decisions may <lb/>be based on the concept within the parameters of identified limitations. <lb/></body>

			<body>The continual success of the cosmeceutical market, both globally and domestically in the <lb/>United States, brings up extensive consumer attention on cosmeceuticals and the functional <lb/>promises that have been emphasized in popular culture media. The combined nature of <lb/>cosmeceuticals (cosmetics and pharmaceuticals) presents the beauty industry as an <lb/>exploratory experience to target consumers in both topical and ingestible forms. To <lb/>understand female consumers&apos; satisfaction with cosmeceuticals and the business service <lb/>quality, the research investigates what relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction. More importantly, female <lb/>cosmeceutical consumers&apos; perception of cosmeceutical business service quality is assessed in <lb/>the cosmeceutical research. As detailed in the manuscript, research results can be used by <lb/>industry leaders and providers to make informed business decisions. <lb/>The purpose of the quantitative correlational research study was to determine what <lb/>relationship, if any, exists between the predictor variable, cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality, and the outcome variable, cosmeceutical client satisfaction, in the Southeast Region <lb/>of the United States. For the research study, cosmeceuticals were defined as non-invasive <lb/>cosmetic services and procedures often performed by esthetic professionals to modify <lb/>physical appearance. Cosmeceutical business service quality, the predictor variable, was <lb/>categorized as prepaid beauty services. Cosmeceutical client satisfaction, the outcome <lb/>research variable, was measured by the PSQ-18, which is a tool to examine the client <lb/>satisfaction for cosmeceutical business services received (Rand Corporation, 2019). As <lb/>primary objective, examining and evaluating the research&apos;s variables to determine what <lb/>relationship, if any, exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical <lb/>client satisfaction in the Southeast Region of the USA is essential. <lb/>The hypotheses addressed the RQ, which questioned what relationship, if any, exists <lb/>between cosmeceutical business service quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction. <lb/>General satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial <lb/>aspects, time spent with professionals and accessibility and convenience were scored to help <lb/>determine if a relationship exists between cosmeceutical business service quality and <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction. The CCSQ-18, the questionnaire used in the current <lb/>research, was web-based. The target population consisted of N 5 50 randomly selected <lb/>female cosmeceutical consumers residing in the Southeast Region of the United States. <lb/>Adding to the limitations of the study was the geographic selection of the Southeast Region of <lb/>the United States, instead of the entire country, excluding the male gender and accessing only <lb/>cosmeceutical consumers instead of medical esthetic or marketing professionals as well. <lb/>The research had 50 total participants who responded to all questions and items of the <lb/>CCSQ-18 which fueled the RQ used in the study. Rand Corporation (2019) detailed how the <lb/>CCSQ-18 produces separate scores for each of seven different subscales: General Satisfaction <lb/>(Items 3 and 17); Technical Quality (Items 2, 4, 6 and 14); Interpersonal Manner (Items 10 and <lb/>11); Communication (Items 1 and 13); Financial Aspects (Items 5 and 7); Time Spent with <lb/>Professionals (Items 12 and 15); Accessibility and Convenience (Items 8, 9, 16 and 18) as <lb/>shown in Table 2. Responses to the survey questions were contingent upon a 5-point Likert <lb/>scale (5 5 strongly disagree, 4 5 disagree, 3 5 neither agree nor disagree, 2 5 agree and <lb/>1 5 strongly agree). The average estimations were computed for each of the 18 items in the <lb/>data analyzation of the survey responses, with the means presented in Table 4. Through the <lb/>LR χ 2 statistic (18) 5 65.35 and its associated probability Prob &gt; χ 2 5 0.000, it was <lb/>determined that the research study variables have a statistically significant effect on one <lb/>another which indicates the correct specification and validity of the research model. <lb/>The research study was executed as a response to the need for a deeper understanding of <lb/>what relationship that may exist between cosmeceutical business service quality and <lb/>cosmeceutical client satisfaction. The relationships among cosmeceutical clients&apos; perceived <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality satisfaction through a self-reported research <lb/></body>

			<body>factors of the research narrowing the scope of the study (Black, 2005; Vogt, 2007). Every <lb/>research design, despite the strength of the method, has some limitations (Simon and Goes, <lb/>2013). Furthermore, limitations reveal why it is impractical to employ the words &quot;prove&quot; and <lb/>&quot;disprove&quot; when referencing research results (Simon and Goes, 2013). Identifying the <lb/>limitations of the research helps strengthen the significance of the study. <lb/>The main limitation of the study is that the direction of the effect on the variables, as a <lb/>whole, cannot be determined. Differentiating positive or negative influences on cosmeceutical <lb/>business service quality is not possible; however, an observation of the individual effect of <lb/>each of the questions is probable. The research is based on EDT of satisfaction, but the <lb/>construct can be improved with the use of additional variables and mediation thereof. Simon <lb/>and Goes (2013) noted individual research designs might only be significant to a group, or the <lb/>relationship among the variables in a correlational analysis might only be tested in specific <lb/>research settings. The relationship discovered among the variables may not be sufficiently <lb/>informative enough for the researcher to rule out all alternative explanations for correlational <lb/>findings and offer evidence for causation. Another limitation is the researcher was not <lb/>allowed to go beyond the data collected in the study; therefore, no additional inferences in the <lb/>research transpired (Simon and Goes, 2013). <lb/>General satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial <lb/>aspects, time spent with professionals and accessibility and convenience were scored to <lb/>help determine whether a relationship exists between cosmeceutical business service <lb/>quality and cosmeceutical client satisfaction. The CCSQ-18, the questionnaire used in the <lb/>current research, was web-based. The target population consisted of N 5 50 randomly <lb/>selected female cosmeceutical consumers residing in the Southeast Region of the United <lb/>States. Adding to the limitations of the study was the geographic selection of the Southeast <lb/>Region of the United States. Instead of the entire country, excluding the male gender and <lb/>accessing only cosmeceutical consumers instead of medical esthetic or marketing <lb/>professionals. <lb/>The research instrument of the study had high internal validity as the instrument had <lb/>undergone extensive psychometric testing, as the PSQ-18 is in its third iteration (Rand <lb/>Corporation, 2019). With the high external validity of the research, the researcher was <lb/>confident that the preference is relevant to all cosmeceutical consumers&apos; decisions. In <lb/>evaluating the research design, the construct validity was extremely high because the <lb/>research processes were aligned with the RQ. The appropriate sample size of 42 participants <lb/>for the research was determined using G*Power Analysis. Cronbach&apos;s alpha for the CCSQ-18 <lb/>questionnaire instrument was 0.84, which indicated strong reliability (Dzwigol, 2020; <lb/>Marshall and Hays, 1994). The researcher did not digress from the detailed research protocol, <lb/>instrumentation, data collection and data analyses at any time. <lb/>The generalizability, trustworthiness, validity and reliability of the research is based on <lb/>the research results revealing most participants (N 5 23, 46%) from the questionnaire agreed <lb/>the cosmeceutical services are available as desired as well as agreed to the providers <lb/>delivering the services desired. Many participants (N 5 28, 56%) also agreed with <lb/>cosmeceutical professionals explaining services well, while (N 5 26, 52%) disagreed with <lb/>cosmeceutical professionals making them wonder about diagnosis. A high percentage of <lb/>participants (N 5 29, 58%) agreed that when going for services, cosmeceutical professionals <lb/>are thorough; additionally, majority of participants (N 5 25, 50%) agreed that the <lb/>professionals deliver treatments in a friendly manner and (N 5 25, 50%) disagreed with not <lb/>being able to afford the services. Notably, participants (N 5 24, 48%) agreed the <lb/>cosmeceutical business service quality received was just about perfect and (N 5 28, 56%) <lb/>indicated disagreement with being dissatisfied. The results showed and confirmed the <lb/>significance of cosmeceutical client satisfaction to cosmeceutical businesses and the beauty <lb/>industry. <lb/></body>
