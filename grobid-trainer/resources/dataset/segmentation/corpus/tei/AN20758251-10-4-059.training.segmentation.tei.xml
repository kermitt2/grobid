			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Uncontrolled aggregation of certain proteins, with <lb/>the formation of histopathological inclusions (pro-<lb/>teinopathy), is a major aspect of the pathogenesis of <lb/>many neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including <lb/>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Hence, the devel-<lb/>opment of drugs capable of inhibiting proteinopathy <lb/>progression is considered as an important direction in <lb/>the development of pathogenic therapy for NDDs. Data <lb/>from recent studies, which have been independently <lb/>obtained at various laboratories in different countries, <lb/>have convincingly proved the ability of a drug that <lb/>belongs to a gamma-carboline group -Dimebon (La-<lb/>trepirdine) -to effectively inhibit the progression of <lb/>model proteinopathies in various transgenic animals. <lb/>Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of Dimebon and <lb/>its derivatives in inhibiting proteinopathy progression <lb/>in model transgenic systems with a ALS phenotype. <lb/>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a serious condition <lb/>of the nervous system, with specific loss of motor neu-<lb/>rons, and it is a type of proteinopathy caused by the ag-<lb/>gregation of certain proteins. The association between <lb/>pathogenic aggregation of these proteins and the de-<lb/>velopment of a ALS phenotype has been demonstrated <lb/>in numerous experimental studies on the modeling of <lb/>the main mechanisms of a neurodegenerative process <lb/>affecting motor neurons [1-3]. In a histopathological <lb/>analysis of idiopathic ALS, the autopsy material of <lb/>most patients contains intracellular protein inclusions. <lb/>Of particular interest are deposits formed by TDP-43 <lb/>and FUS DNA/RNA-binding proteins [4-6]. The direct <lb/>mechanisms underlying the pathogenic aggregation <lb/>of these proteins, leading to dysfunction and death of <lb/>motor neurons, may be a specific trait of a given pro-<lb/>tein. There is little doubt that the process of pathogenic <lb/>protein aggregation plays an important role in the <lb/></body>

The <lb/>intermediate products of this aggregation are toxic to neurons and may be lethal. The development strategy of <lb/>pathogenic therapy for proteinopathy is based on the design of drugs capable of both inhibiting proteinopathy <lb/>progression and increasing the survival of affected neurons. The results of a decade-long research effort at <lb/>leading Russian and international laboratories have demonstrated that Dimebon (Latrepirdine), as well as a <lb/>number of its derivatives from a gamma-carboline group, show a strong neuroprotective effect and can mod-<lb/>ulate the course of a neurodegenerative process in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. The accumulated <lb/>data indicate that gamma-carbolines are promising compounds for the development of pathogenic therapy for <lb/>proteinopathies. <lb/>KEYWORDS ALS, Dimebon, gamma-carbolines, proteinopathy, transgenic animals. <lb/>ABBREVIATIONS ALS -amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FUS -fused in sarcoma; NDD -neurodegenerative disease; <lb/>TDP-43 -transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. <lb/></front>

			<body>pathogenesis of all ALS forms and might be an obvious <lb/>target for therapeutic interventions. <lb/>NEUROPROTECTIVE PROPERTIES <lb/>OF GAMMA-CARBOLINES <lb/>Data from independent studies at several laboratories <lb/>have demonstrated that compounds belonging to the <lb/>gamma-carboline class are potential neuroprotective <lb/>agents leading to reduced levels of pathogenic ag-<lb/>gregation and/or activating the intracellular defense <lb/>mechanisms of controlled degradation of aggregated <lb/>proteins [7, 8]. Initial findings for these gamma-car-<lb/>bolines properties were obtained in Dimebon stud-<lb/>ies showing a correction of the cognitive function in <lb/>patients with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), which is the <lb/>most common neurodegenerative disease in the pro-<lb/>teinopathy group [9, 10]. Furthermore, clinical trials <lb/>conducted at several centers have revealed a positive <lb/>effect from Dimebon on the cognitive function of pa-<lb/>tients with Huntington&apos;s disease [11]. Yet, phase III <lb/>clinical trials have indicated that Dimebon treatment is <lb/>not considered effective compared to other developed <lb/>drugs for the pathogenic therapy of AD [12], which is <lb/>most likely due to the extremely high heterogeneity of <lb/>nosological forms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. However, the <lb/>mechanisms of action of the drug and its derivatives on <lb/>proteinopathy progression have remained the object <lb/>of intense research at several laboratories [13]. For ex-<lb/>ample, the results of a recent meta-analysis revealed <lb/>a positive effect from Dimebon on neuropsychiatric <lb/>status indicators in AD patients [14] and provided an <lb/>additional incentive to continue research in this di-<lb/>rection. In addition, in a homogeneous model system <lb/>of transgenic animals, Dimebon was shown to inhibit <lb/>the development of tau proteinopathy, which is one <lb/>of the key components of AD pathology [15]. Another <lb/>key proteinopathy in the pathogenesis of AD is cere-<lb/>bral amyloidosis, which was also inhibited by Dimebon <lb/>in TgCRND8 [16-18] and 3xTg-AD [19] mice, but not <lb/>in a 5xFAD model characterized by a more aggres-<lb/>sive course of amyloidosis [20]. These data served as <lb/>grounds for expanding the range of research areas of <lb/>gamma-carbolines effects on the progression of oth-<lb/>er proteinopathies that play an important role in the <lb/>pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. <lb/>EFFECT OF GAMMA-CARBOLINES ON THE <lb/>PROGRESSION OF PROTEINOPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH <lb/>THE SPECIFIC INVOLVEMENT OF MOTOR NEURONS <lb/>Chronic administration of Dimebon to a transgenic <lb/>mouse model with the pan-neuronal expression of <lb/>gamma-synuclein which reproduced the main features <lb/>of ALS pathogenesis [21, 22] delayed the progression of <lb/>proteinopathy [23, 24]. In this case, there was a signifi-<lb/>cant decrease in the level of aggregated detergent-in-<lb/>soluble gamma-synuclein isoforms in affected areas <lb/>of the nervous system in transgenic mice [25] and a <lb/>decrease in gamma-synuclein-reactive inclusions in the <lb/>affected spinal cord parts of the experimental animals <lb/>[21, 22]. This effect was more pronounced if administra-<lb/>tion was begun at the pre-symptomatic stage, long be-<lb/>fore the first manifestations of the pathological process, <lb/>according to both clinical symptoms and histological <lb/>analysis. The same feature of Dimebon was observed <lb/>in SOD1 G93A transgenic mice: if Dimebon was adminis-<lb/>tered long before the expected age of manifestations of <lb/>ALS phenotype-associated symptoms, then the onset <lb/>of model disease symptoms occurred later, leading to <lb/>an increased lifespan for the animals [26]. However, if <lb/>Dimebon administration was started at an age closer <lb/>to the expected onset of model disease symptoms, then <lb/>the drug effects were much less pronounced [27]. We <lb/>confirmed the ability of Dimebon and its derivatives to <lb/>inhibit proteinopathy progression in a FUS 1-359 trans-<lb/>genic mouse line [28, 29] which was recently generated <lb/>and represents an adequate model of specific involve-<lb/>ment of motor neurons with the ALS phenotype. In the <lb/>nervous system of these mice, similarly to patients with <lb/>FUS-associated forms of ALS, the histopathological <lb/>analysis reveals an accumulation of aberrant FUS iso-<lb/>forms in characteristic cytoplasmic protein aggregates. <lb/>Both Dimebon and its derivatives could modify, albeit <lb/>with different efficacies, the progression of FUS pro-<lb/>teinopathy in the nervous system of the FUS 1-359 mice <lb/>[30]. For example, the lifespan of model animals treated <lb/>with Dimebon increased statistically significantly. Fur-<lb/>thermore, transfer of the FUS 1-359 mouse line from the <lb/>C57Bl/6J genetic background, which was initially used <lb/>in most studies in various laboratories, to the CD-1 ge-<lb/>netic background did not affect the proteinopathy-in-<lb/>hibiting effect of gamma-carbolines and may not be <lb/>explained by increased sensitivity of the C57Bl/6J line <lb/>to gamma-carbolines [30]. In addition to an increased <lb/>lifespan, the FUS 1-359 mice treated with Dimebon or its <lb/>derivative were characterized by a delayed onset of <lb/>model disease symptoms with the development of a <lb/>pronounced ALS phenotype if administration of the <lb/>compounds was initiated at early latent stages of FUS <lb/>proteinopathy [31]. However, the exact mechanism <lb/>of Dimebon action remains unclear. The existing data <lb/>from biochemical studies, as well as experiments on cell <lb/>cultures and animals, suggest that Dimebon is a mul-<lb/>titarget drug capable of affecting many intracellular <lb/>processes and various pathogenic pathways in neurons <lb/>and other cells affected by neurodegenerative changes <lb/>[7]. <lb/>Particularly, Dimebon can modulate the functioning <lb/>of receptors and channels, change the kinetics of sig-<lb/></body>

			<body>naling enzymes [9, 32-35], as well as stabilize mitochon-<lb/>drial activity [36, 37]. But perhaps, the most significant <lb/>property of Dimebon, which makes it a basic compound <lb/>in the development of approaches for the treatment of <lb/>proteinopathy, lies in its ability to inhibit the accumu-<lb/>lation of cellular pathogenic protein aggregates. <lb/>GAMMA-CARBOLINE-BASED INHIBITION OF <lb/>ACCUMULATION OF PATHOHISTOLOGICAL <lb/>PROTEIN INCLUSIONS IN NEURONAL CYTOPLASM <lb/>The ability of Dimebon to prevent an accumulation <lb/>of pathogenic protein inclusions in neuronal bodies <lb/>was first demonstrated in our joint research with <lb/>M. Hasegawa&apos;s and M. Goedert&apos;s laboratories on cell <lb/>cultures producing the aberrant and highly aggre-<lb/>gating RNA-binding protein TDP-43 [38, 39]. The <lb/>effect was confirmed using another cell model with <lb/>the aggregation of the RNA-binding protein FUS. We <lb/>demonstrated that addition of Dimebon and/or its de-<lb/>rivatives to cultured human neuroblastoma cells with <lb/>FUS proteinopathy reduces both the amount of insol-<lb/>uble protein forms in the cytoplasmic fraction and the <lb/>amount of protein inclusions formed in the cytoplasm <lb/>(unpublished data). Subsequent studies performed <lb/>on various model proteinopathy systems confirmed <lb/>these effects, and in our view they are associated with <lb/>the activation of the autophagosome system in Dime-<lb/>bon-treated groups [16, 40-42]. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>The results of a decade-long research effort conducted <lb/>at leading Russian and international laboratories have <lb/>demonstrated that compounds from the gamma-car-<lb/>boline series are indeed capable of suppressing the <lb/>progression of certain types of proteinopathies and, as <lb/>in the case of ALS models, slow down the development <lb/>of the model phenotype of neurodegenerative process-<lb/>es in vivo. It is the modulation of aggregation of the <lb/>proteins involved in proteinopathy mechanisms that is <lb/>considered as the major element behind the concept of <lb/>developing pathogenic therapy for neurodegenerative <lb/>diseases [43]. At present, there is enough supporting <lb/>evidence for considering Dimebon and its derivatives <lb/>as promising compounds for the development of new <lb/>therapeutic agents with improved pharmacokinetics <lb/>and efficacy, which may be used as part of a complex <lb/>pathogenic therapy for socially significant neurodegen-<lb/>erative diseases. <lb/></body>
