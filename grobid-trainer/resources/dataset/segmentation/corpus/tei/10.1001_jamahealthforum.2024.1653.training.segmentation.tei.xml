Risk assessment models (RAMs) have been developed to stratify VTE risk, <lb/>but a prospective head-to-head comparison of validated RAMs is lacking. <lb/>OBJECTIVES To prospectively validate an easy-to-use RAM, the simplified Geneva score, and <lb/>compare its prognostic performance with previously validated RAMs. <lb/>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study was conducted from June <lb/>18, 2020, to January 4, 2022, with a 90-day follow-up. A total of 4205 consecutive adults admitted <lb/>to the general internal medicine departments of 3 Swiss university hospitals for hospitalization for <lb/>more than 24 hours due to acute illness were screened for eligibility; 1352 without therapeutic <lb/>anticoagulation were included. <lb/>EXPOSURES At admission, items of 4 RAMs (ie, the simplified and original Geneva score, the Padua <lb/>score, and the IMPROVE [International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism] <lb/>score) were collected. Patients were stratified into high and low VTE risk groups according to <lb/>each RAM. <lb/>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Symptomatic VTE within 90 days. <lb/>RESULTS Of 1352 medical inpatients (median age, 67 years [IQR, 54-77 years]; 762 men [55.4%]), 28 <lb/>(2.1%) experienced VTE. Based on the simplified Geneva score, 854 patients (63.2%) were classified <lb/>as high risk, with a 90-day VTE risk of 2.6% (n = 22; 95% CI, 1.7%-3.9%), and 498 patients (36.8%) <lb/>were classified as low risk, with a 90-day VTE risk of 1.2% (n = 6; 95% CI, 0.6%-2.6%). Sensitivity of <lb/>the simplified Geneva score was 78.6% (95% CI, 60.5%-89.8%) and specificity was 37.2% (95% CI, <lb/>34.6%-39.8%); the positive likelihood ratio of the simplified Geneva score was 1.25 (95% CI, <lb/>1.03-1.52) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.28-1.18). In head-to-head <lb/>comparisons, sensitivity was highest for the original Geneva score (82.1%; 95% CI, 64.4%-92.1%), <lb/>while specificity was highest for the IMPROVE score (70.4%; 95% CI, 67.9%-72.8%). After adjusting <lb/>the VTE risk for thromboprophylaxis use and site, there was no significant difference between the <lb/>high-risk and low-risk groups based on the simplified Geneva score (subhazard ratio, 2.04 [95% CI, <lb/>0.83-5.05]; P = .12) and other RAMs. Discriminative performance was poor for all RAMs, with an area <lb/>under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 53.8% (95% CI, 51.1%-56.5%) for the <lb/>original Geneva score to 58.1% (95% CI, 55.4%-60.7%) for the simplified Geneva score. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This head-to-head comparison of validated RAMs found <lb/>suboptimal accuracy and prognostic performance of the simplified Geneva score and other RAMs to <lb/>predict hospital-acquired VTE in medical inpatients. Clinical usefulness of existing RAMs is <lb/>questionable, highlighting the need for more accurate VTE prediction strategies. <lb/>JAMA Network Open. 2024;7(5):e249980. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.9980 <lb/>Key Points <lb/>Question What is the prognostic <lb/>performance of the simplified Geneva <lb/>score and other validated risk <lb/>assessment models (RAMs) to predict <lb/>venous thromboembolism (VTE) in <lb/>medical inpatients? <lb/>Findings In this cohort study providing <lb/>a head-to-head comparison of validated <lb/>RAMs among 1352 medical inpatients, <lb/>sensitivity of RAMs to predict 90-day <lb/>VTE ranged from 39.3% to 82.1% and <lb/>specificity of RAMs ranged from 34.3% <lb/>to 70.4%. Discrimination was poor, with <lb/>an area under the receiver operating <lb/>characteristic curve of less than 60% for <lb/>all RAMs. <lb/>Meaning This study suggests that the <lb/>accuracy and prognostic performance of <lb/>the simplified Geneva score and other <lb/>validated RAMs to predict VTE is limited <lb/>and their clinical usefulness is thus <lb/>questionable. <lb/>+ Invited Commentary <lb/>+ Supplemental content <lb/>Author affiliations and article information are <lb/>listed at the end of this article. <lb/>Open Access.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents one of the leading avoidable causes of death among <lb/>hospitalized patients. 1 Although particularly common among patients undergoing surgery, 2 about <lb/>75% of hospital-acquired cases of VTE occur in nonsurgical patients. 3 Pharmacologic <lb/>thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of VTE among selected medical inpatients. 4-6 However, given <lb/>the associated small increase in bleeding risk and the low baseline VTE incidence in the overall <lb/>population of medical inpatients, 4,7 its provision should be targeted to patients at increased risk <lb/>of VTE. 4,7,8 <lb/>Although risk stratification in surgical patients is based mostly on the type of intervention, 2 <lb/>assessment of VTE risk among medical patients is more challenging and requires integration of <lb/>various individual risk factors. 9,10 To simplify and standardize VTE risk assessment among medical <lb/>inpatients, risk assessment models (RAMs) such as the original Geneva score, 11 the Padua score, 12 or <lb/>the IMPROVE (International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism) score 13 <lb/>have been developed, and their use is encouraged by clinical guidelines. 7,8,14 The practical usefulness <lb/>of current RAMs is, however, limited by suboptimal sensitivities, 15 nonuniform cutoff values to define <lb/>risk groups, 13,16 or a large number of variables. 11 With the aim of developing a more usable RAM, the <lb/>simplified Geneva score has been derived. 17 A retrospective external validation study showed good <lb/>discrimination and calibration of the simplified Geneva score 18 ; however, prospective validation is <lb/>currently lacking. In addition, the comparative performance of validated RAMs has not been <lb/>examined prospectively. Using data from a prospective multicenter cohort of medical inpatients, we <lb/>aimed to validate the simplified Geneva score and to perform a head-to-head comparison of its <lb/>prognostic performance with previously validated RAMs. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study Design and Setting <lb/>RISE (Risk Stratification for Hospital-Acquired Thromboembolism in Medical Patients) is a <lb/>multicenter prospective cohort study of medical patients admitted to 3 Swiss tertiary care hospitals <lb/>from June 18, 2020, to January 4, 2022 (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04439383). The methods have been <lb/>previously described. 19 Reporting conforms to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable <lb/>Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) reporting guideline and checklist <lb/>for prediction model validation. 20 The study was conducted in accordance with all applicable legal <lb/>and regulatory requirements. Authorization was granted from the responsible ethics committees <lb/>(Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern, Commission cantonale d&apos;éthique de la recherche sur l&apos;être <lb/>humain CER-VD, and Commission Cantonale d&apos;Ethique de la Recherche sur l&apos;être humain [CCER]), <lb/>and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. <lb/></body>

			<body>Population <lb/>Consecutive adults hospitalized in general internal medicine were screened on weekdays, and <lb/>eligible patients were enrolled within 72 hours of admission. We included acutely ill patients aged 18 <lb/>years or older who were admitted for hospitalization for more than 24 hours. Exclusion criteria were <lb/>indication for therapeutic anticoagulation, estimated life expectancy less than 30 days, transfer from <lb/>the intensive care unit or other wards, insufficient German or French language proficiency, prior <lb/>enrollment in the study, and unwillingness to provide informed consent. For patients unable to <lb/>consent due to mental illness or cognitive impairment, written consent was obtained from an <lb/>authorized representative. <lb/>VTE RAMs <lb/>At baseline, study personnel collected data on demographics, comorbidities, and VTE risk factors <lb/>(Table 1; eMethods in Supplement 1).

            <body>and the Padua score were calculated and patients were categorized as high or low VTE risk according <lb/>to each RAM (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). 11-13,17 Treating physicians were not informed of the scores <lb/>and the use of thromboprophylaxis was not influenced by the study. No RAM was implemented in <lb/>order sets, but internal guidelines suggested to use the Padua score in 2 centers and the simplified <lb/>Geneva score in 1 center to assess the indication for thromboprophylaxis. For patients at high risk of <lb/>VTE, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis was recommended, or nonpharmacologic prophylaxis for <lb/>those at high bleeding risk. <lb/>Outcome <lb/>The primary outcome was symptomatic, objectively confirmed fatal and nonfatal VTE, including <lb/>pulmonary embolism as well as distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis of the lower and upper <lb/>extremity within 90 days of admission (eMethods in Supplement 1). To exclude preexisting VTE, we <lb/>did not consider VTE diagnosed within 48 hours of admission. 21 To assess VTE outcomes, study <lb/>personnel blinded to RAM scores conducted follow-up visits on the day prior to discharge or the day <lb/>of discharge, and contacted participants, their contact persons, and/or primary care physicians by <lb/>telephone 90 days after admission. 11,22 In case of a VTE outcome, medical and radiologic reports <lb/>were collected to assess the date, type, and circumstances of the event. For participants who died, <lb/>the cause was recorded based on medical reports, death certificates, and autopsy reports, if available <lb/>(eMethods in Supplement 1).

			<body>simplified Geneva score, and assuming a 90-day VTE incidence of 2.8% among patients at high risk <lb/>and 0.6% among patients at low risk based on a previous study, 17 we determined that recruitment of <lb/>1308 patients would be required to detect an absolute risk difference of 2.2%, with a power of 80% <lb/>at a 2-sided α of .05. To account for potential dropouts, we aimed to recruit 1350 participants. <lb/>Standard descriptive statistical tests were used to compare low and high VTE risk groups based <lb/>on the simplified Geneva score. Time-to-event analyses with competing risk methods were used to <lb/>assess the prognostic performance of the simplified Geneva score and the other RAMs and their <lb/>association with VTE, with non-VTE death representing the competing risk, using a subdistribution <lb/>hazard model of Fine and Gray. 23 Subhazard ratios with 95% CIs were calculated, first unadjusted and <lb/>then adjusted for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis use as a time-varying covariate and for study <lb/>site. Cumulative incidences of VTE among patients at low risk and patients at high risk were assessed <lb/>using Kaplan-Meier curves, with calculation of P values based on log-rank tests. Sensitivity, <lb/>specificity, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios were determined for <lb/>each RAM. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the discriminative power of each <lb/>continuous score using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, considering <lb/>censored data and competing events. Calibration was determined using the Hosmer-Lemeshow <lb/>goodness-of-fit test; use of a calibration plot was not possible because 2 of the RAMs were derived <lb/>empirically (ie, based on literature or clinical expertise) rather than data driven. 12,17,18 <lb/>Patients for whom therapeutic anticoagulation was started for reasons other than VTE during <lb/>follow-up were censored in the main analysis. Patients who were lost to follow-up were censored at <lb/>the last visit. <lb/>We performed a subgroup analysis of patients who did not receive pharmacologic <lb/>thromboprophylaxis at any time during hospitalization, and a subgroup analysis stratified by <lb/>antiplatelet treatment during hospitalization. In a sensitivity analysis, we investigated how different <lb/>outcome scenarios among patients lost to follow-up would be associated with discriminative <lb/>performance of RAMs. The scenarios included VTE occurring (1) in all patients lost to follow-up, (2) in <lb/>patients at high risk, and 3) in patients at low risk only. <lb/>Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC), and R, version 4.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing), were <lb/>used for all analyses. A 2-sided P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. <lb/>Results <lb/>Of 4205 patients screened, 1352 were included in the RISE cohort (eFigure in Supplement 1). The <lb/>median age was 67 years (IQR, 54-77 years) (vs 76 years [IQR, 64-85 years] for those excluded), with <lb/>590 women (43.6%) and 762 men (56.4%) (Table 1). Overall, 263 patients (19.5%) had active cancer, <lb/>and 88 (6.5%) had a previous VTE event. Immobilization for 3 days or more was recorded for 382 <lb/>patients (28.3%), and 698 (51.6%) had a prescription for pharmacologic or mechanical VTE <lb/>prophylaxis at baseline. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR, 5-11 days). The proportion of <lb/>patients in the low-risk category receiving thromboprophylaxis was 37.9% (174 of 459) based on the <lb/>original Geneva score. The proportion of patients categorized as high risk of VTE was 63.2% <lb/>(n = 854) based on the simplified Geneva score, slightly higher with the original Geneva score (66.1% <lb/>[n = 893]), and lower with the Padua score (47.8% [n = 646]) and the IMPROVE score (29.8% <lb/>[n = 403]) (eFigure in Supplement 1). <lb/>Of all 1352 study participants, 10 (0.7%) were lost to follow-up and 88 (6.5%) died during the <lb/>90-day follow-up period. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 28 patients (2.1%); 18 events were <lb/>pulmonary embolism (no fatal pulmonary embolism), and 10 were deep vein thrombosis. <lb/>According to the simplified Geneva score, VTE occurred in 2.6% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.9%) of <lb/>patients at high risk (22 of 854) and 1.2% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.6%) of patients at low risk (6 of 498) <lb/>(eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Similarly, VTE risk was 2.6% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.8%) (23 of 893) in the high-<lb/>risk group and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.5%-2.5%) (5 of 459) in the low-risk group according to the original <lb/>Geneva risk score, 2.8% (95% CI, 1.8%-4.4%) (18 of 646) in the high-risk group and 1.4% (95% CI, <lb/></body>

			<body>the original Geneva score, the Padua score, and the IMPROVE score. The cumulative incidence of VTE <lb/>within 90 days for low-risk and high-risk categories of all 4 RAMs did not significantly differ. Overall, <lb/>our results suggest that existing RAMs do not perform particularly well in identifying medical <lb/>inpatients at risk for VTE. <lb/>We found no association between risk group and time to a first VTE event for all 4 RAMs. <lb/>Although the overall incidence of VTE within 90 days was similar in our study compared with the <lb/>derivation cohorts of the Geneva score, Padua score, and IMPROVE score, VTE incidence among <lb/>those in the low-risk categories of our validation cohort was surprisingly high (1.1%-1.8% vs 0.3%-<lb/>0.6% in the derivation cohorts of the RAMs) 11-13 and above the 1% threshold that has been suggested <lb/>for provision of thromboprophylaxis. 7 A potential explanation for the comparatively high VTE <lb/>incidence in the low-risk groups could possibly be associated with the differing proportions of <lb/>patients with pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. 11,17 The proportion of patients in the low-risk <lb/>category receiving thromboprophylaxis was lower in our cohort (37.9% [174 of 459] based on the <lb/>original Geneva score) 24 than in the derivation cohort (49%) of the original and simplified Geneva <lb/>score, 17 or other large cohorts. 1,10 <lb/>The sensitivities of the RAMs based on our study were lower than in previous cohorts. 11,25,26 For <lb/>example, sensitivity ranged from 73% to 90% (for the original and simplified Geneva scores, Padua <lb/>score, and IMPROVE score) in a post hoc analysis from a Swiss prospective cohort, and from 74% to <lb/>92% (for the Caprini score, IMPROVE score, and Padua score) in a retrospective analysis from the <lb/>French PREVENU (Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism Disease in Emergency Departments) <lb/>study. 17,26 Sensitivity is critical in RAMs to select patients for whom a preventive intervention (ie, <lb/>thromboprophylaxis) can be safely forgone. 27 However, specificity should also be considered: use of <lb/>the simplified and original Geneva scores to target thromboprophylaxis prescription may result in <lb/>overtreatment due to their low specificity and high sensitivity. <lb/>The discriminative performance for 90-day VTE was poor in our study, with an AUC of 53.8% to <lb/>58.1%. Although some previous validation studies (based on retrospective data or post hoc analyses <lb/>of prospectively collected data) showed better discriminative performance (AUC &gt;70%), 16,17 poor <lb/>results had also been reported in an external validation study of RAMs (including the Padua score and <lb/>the IMPROVE score) using medical record data from Michigan hospitals, 28 as well as the <lb/>retrospective analysis of the PREVENU study. 26 <lb/>There are several potential explanations for the different results of our study and derivation or <lb/>other validation studies of the Geneva score, Padua score, and IMPROVE score. 16,17 First, VTE risk in <lb/>low-and high-risk groups based on RAMs can be overestimated or underestimated by differing <lb/>thromboprophylaxis use in the risk groups. Second, differences could be due to the definition of <lb/>immobility, which differs between RAMs. 29 Subjective estimation of mobility is inaccurate, 30 and <lb/>often surrogates such as the ability to go to the bathroom are used to quantify mobility. 11,16,17 As <lb/>mobility is a highly weighted item in all these RAMs, objective mobility measures (eg, from <lb/>accelerometry) may improve estimation of VTE risk. Third, data of derivation studies and some <lb/>validation studies have been collected more than 10 years ago, 11,13,16,18 and inpatient care practices <lb/>have changed within the last decade (eg, with shorter hospital stays, intensified in-hospital <lb/>mobilization), with a direct association with VTE risk. 14 Fourth, although our cohort is generally <lb/>comparable with the population of the derivation studies (eTable 9 in Supplement 1), there may be <lb/>unmeasured variations in characteristics associated with VTE risk. For example, approximately <lb/>one-third of the patients in our cohort received antiplatelet therapy, while these data are not <lb/>reported for previous derivation and validation studies. 11-13,16,17 However, antiplatelet treatment did <lb/>not have a relevant association with accuracy measures in our study. In addition, subsequent <lb/>hospitalizations and subsequent use of thromboprophylaxis may be associated with 90-day VTE risk. <lb/>Given the overall limited accuracy and prognostic performance of all analyzed RAMs, our results <lb/>cast doubts on their reliability to identify medical inpatients at risk of VTE for whom <lb/>thromboprophylaxis is warranted. Even though guidelines, including those from the American <lb/>College of Chest Physicians or the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, encourage the <lb/></body>

            <body>use of RAMs to identify medical inpatients at high VTE risk, 7,14 our results emphasize the need for <lb/>more accurate risk prediction strategies, as already advocated by others. 8 For example, it is unclear <lb/>whether the use of objective mobility measures or artificial intelligence-based models could improve <lb/>VTE risk prediction. 19,31 In addition, the clinical benefit associated with applying RAMs is unclear. 8,25 <lb/>Except for a single randomized trial that showed a reduction in VTE rates with a computer-alert <lb/>program incorporating the Kucher RAM, 32 no prospective comparative study has, to our knowledge, <lb/>demonstrated improved clinical or economic outcomes with the application of RAMs in clinical <lb/>practice. 33 The overall necessity of VTE risk stratification to implement targeted thromboprophylaxis <lb/>may be questioned in light of the uncertain net clinical benefit associated with thromboprophylaxis <lb/>for medical inpatients. 34,35 Randomized clinical trials conducted more than 15 years ago showed up <lb/>to 63% reductions in VTE with pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis compared with placebo, <lb/>although the results were mainly due to a reduced risk of asymptomatic VTE of unclear clinical <lb/>relevance. 6,36,37 The recently published SYMPTOMS (Systematic Elderly Medical Patients <lb/>Thromboprophylaxis: Efficacy on Symptomatic Outcomes) trial did not show significant differences <lb/>in symptomatic VTE at 30 days in more than 2500 older medical inpatients randomized to <lb/>enoxaparin or placebo, albeit the trial was underpowered due to premature termination. 38 In <lb/>addition, thromboprophylaxis does not reduce mortality in medical inpatients, 5 but may be <lb/>associated with a small increase in bleeding risk based on results of a meta-analysis, 4 although we did <lb/>not find such an association in data from our cohort. 39 <lb/>Limitations <lb/>Our study has some limitations. First, results may have been affected by thromboprophylaxis use, <lb/>and unadjusted accuracy measures are therefore difficult to interpret. To address this limitation, we <lb/>conducted a subgroup analysis among patients without thromboprophylaxis, but the size of the <lb/>subpopulation was small and thus the analysis was underpowered. Thromboprophylaxis was not <lb/>assigned at random, which may have had a negative association with measures of accuracy and <lb/>discrimination due to lower actual VTE rates among patients at high risk for VTE. However, the <lb/>potential for this bias is reduced by the relevant proportion of underuse of thromboprophylaxis for <lb/>patients at high risk and overuse for patients at low risk, as previously demonstrated in our <lb/>cohort. 11,24,40 In addition, all 4 RAMs were derived in populations of patients with or without <lb/>thromboprophylaxis, and withholding thromboprophylaxis to perform a derivation or validation <lb/>study would be unethical. Second, the number of VTE events was low, with large 95% CIs around the <lb/>estimates. Even though differences in VTE risk between low-risk and high-risk groups were not <lb/>statistically significant, they may still be clinically relevant. Third, given that patients were recruited <lb/>from Swiss university hospitals, our results may not be generalizable to health care settings outside <lb/>of high-income countries or White populations. Fourth, patients at high risk may have been <lb/>underrepresented in our cohort, given that patients screened but excluded were older than those <lb/>included, although this may be mostly explained by exclusion of populations for whom RAMs are <lb/>irrelevant (eg, those receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or with a life expectancy &lt;30 days). Fifth, <lb/>we did not use specific criteria to define recurrent deep vein thrombosis. 41 However, only 1 deep vein <lb/>thrombosis event occurred in a patient with prior VTE. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>To our knowledge, this cohort study provides the first prospective head-to-head comparison of <lb/>validated RAMs. The easy-to-use simplified Geneva score showed similarly poor performance in <lb/>predicting the risk for hospital-acquired VTE among medical inpatients compared with other <lb/>validated RAMs. Overall, accuracy and prognostic performance of all analyzed RAMs were limited, <lb/>questioning their clinical usefulness. More accurate strategies to predict VTE risk among medical <lb/>inpatients as well as randomized studies evaluating the effect of risk assessment strategies <lb/>are needed. <lb/></body>
