			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>More and more natural DNA variants are being linked to physiological traits. Yet, <lb/>understanding what differences they make on molecular regulations remains challenging. <lb/>Important properties of gene regulatory networks can be captured by computational models. If <lb/>model parameters can be &apos;personalized&apos; according to the genotype, their variation may then <lb/>reveal how DNA variants operate in the network. Here, we combined experiments and <lb/>computations to visualize natural alleles of the yeast GAL3 gene in a space of model <lb/>parameters describing the galactose response network. Alleles altering the activation of Gal3p <lb/>by galactose were discriminated from those affecting its activity (production/degradation or <lb/>efficiency of the activated protein). The approach allowed us to correctly predict that a non-<lb/>synonymous SNP would change the binding affinity of Gal3p with the Gal80p transcriptional <lb/>repressor. Our results illustrate how personalizing gene regulatory models can be used for the <lb/>mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>In the past decade, countless DNA variants have been associated to physiological <lb/>traits. A major challenge now is to understand how they operate at the molecular level. This is <lb/>a difficult task because the mechanistic consequences resulting from each variant are not easy <lb/>to identify. Even when the function of a gene is well documented, investigators need to <lb/>determine the tissues, cells or organelles in which a mutant allele makes a biological <lb/>difference, the developmental stage at which this may happen, the metabolic or regulatory <lb/>network that may be involved, as well as possible molecular scenarios. A mutation may alter <lb/>the regulation of transcription or mRNA splicing; the enzymatic activity of the target protein; <lb/>its rate of production, maturation, or degradation; its intracellular localisation; its binding <lb/>affinity to an interacting partner or the specificity of its molecular interactions. In the vast <lb/>majority of cases, information from the DNA sequence alone is not sufficient to delimit the <lb/>perimeter of possible implications. <lb/>Systems biology has opened new opportunities to better predict the action of DNA <lb/>variants. First, &apos;omics&apos; data that are gathered at various levels (DNA, transcripts, proteins, <lb/>metabolites...) establish relations between target sequences and functional pathways. <lb/>Information about molecular and genetic interactions, expression profiles, chromatin <lb/>landscapes, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations can be exploited to derive <lb/>functional predictions of DNA variants. Various methods have been proposed to do this, such <lb/>as Bayesian genetic mapping 1 , visualization of SNPs on relational protein networks 2 , <lb/>prioritization based on negative selection 3 , or inference of miRNA:RNA binding defects 4 . In <lb/>addition, structural data of biomolecules can also highlight functional perturbations in specific <lb/>domains such as catalytic sites or interaction surfaces 5,6 . <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>Another alternative is to model the quantitative and dynamic properties of molecular <lb/>reactions and to explore which feature(s) may be affected by a DNA variant. The functional <lb/>consequences of mutations can then be inferred by considering their impact on specific <lb/>parameters of the model. In other words, assigning function to a DNA variant may be <lb/>straightforward after it is linked to parameters of a model. This perspective may also, on the <lb/>long term, generate developments in personalized medicine: if a model can be personalized <lb/>according to the patient&apos;s genotype then it can help predict disease progress or treatment <lb/>outcome and therefore adapt medical care to the patient&apos;s specificities. For this to become <lb/>reality, the model must be i) informative on the biological trait of interest and ii) identifiable <lb/>and sufficiently constrained so that model parameters can be reliably inferred, accounting for <lb/>the patient&apos;s specificities. These two requirements antagonize each other regarding the <lb/>complexity of the model to be used. The former asks for completeness: the molecular control <lb/>of the trait must be correctly covered by the model, describing known reactions as best as <lb/>possible. The latter asks for simplicity: if too many parameters are allowed to be adjusted to <lb/>the data, then the validity of the personalized model is questionable and none of the <lb/>adjustments are informative. It is therefore important to determine if and how personalizing <lb/>model parameters can be productive. <lb/>For a given molecular network, individuals from natural populations have different <lb/>genotypes at several nodes (genes) of the network, as well as in numerous external factors that <lb/>can affect the network properties. Such external factors can modify, for example, global <lb/>translation efficiencies, metabolic states, or pathways that cross-talk with the network of <lb/>interest. Adapting model parameters to specific individuals is challenging when so many <lb/>sources of variation exist. A way to circumvent this difficulty is to study the network <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>experimentally in the context of a more reduced and focused variation. If investigators have <lb/>access to nearly-isogenic individuals that differ only at specific genes of the network, they can <lb/>then characterize the differences in network behaviour that result from these specific allelic <lb/>differences. The numerous external factors affecting the network can then be ignored or <lb/>drastically simplified in the model because they are common to all individuals. This way, the <lb/>parameter space is constrained and only potentially-informative parameters are allowed to be <lb/>adjusted to fit individual-specific data. <lb/>Some model organisms such as the yeast S. cerevisiae offer this possibility. They can <lb/>be manipulated to generate single allelic changes, which provides an ideal framework to link <lb/>DNA variants to model parameters. In particular, the gene regulatory network controlling the <lb/>yeast response to galactose (GAL network) is well characterized, both in vivo and in silico. <lb/>This circuit controls galactose utilization by upregulating the expression of regulatory and <lb/>metabolic genes in response to extracellular galactose 7 . Regulation is based on the <lb/>transcriptional activator Gal4p, the galactose transporter Gal2p, a signal transducer Gal3p and <lb/>the transcriptional inhibitor Gal80p. In addition, the galactokinase Gal1p, involved in <lb/>galactose metabolism is also a coinducer of the response 8 . This system can display either a <lb/>gradual induction (where the rate of transcription progressively increases in each cell <lb/>according to the timing and intensity of the stimulus) or a probabilistic induction (where the <lb/>probability of having high/low rate of transcription in each cell varies). This dual behaviour <lb/>has received a lot of attention and important molecular features have been elucidated by <lb/>experimental and theoretical approaches 9-12 . In particular, the dynamic response of a <lb/>population of cells to galactose can be described by two quantities: the inducibility of the <lb/>network is defined as the proportion of activated cells in the population, and the amplitude of <lb/>the response refers to the expression level that is reached by induced cells. Regulatory <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>feedback loops of the network are critical to the switch-like behaviour. They were shown to <lb/>feed back the dynamics of transcription bursts rather than the levels of expression 13 . They <lb/>regulate the amplitude response by reducing noise in GAL gene expression 14 , they control the <lb/>inducibility by fine-tuning the timing of the switch 14 , and they participate to the memory of <lb/>previous inductions 15,16 . As a consequence, bimodal distributions of expression of the GAL <lb/>genes can be observed in isogenic populations exposed to intermediate concentrations of <lb/>inducer 17-19 , and this population heterogeneity can confer a growth advantage during the <lb/>transition from glucose to galactose metabolism (diauxic shift) 20 . Interestingly, wild yeast <lb/>isolates present diverse types of induction dynamics during the diauxic shift, ranging from <lb/>strictly unimodal to transient bimodal distribution of expression levels 21,22 . This indicates that <lb/>natural genetic variation can modify the network dynamics. <lb/>The GAL3 gene plays a central role in the network. Its protein product Gal3p is <lb/>activated by binding to galactose and ATP and then binds as a dimer to Gal80p dimers to <lb/>release the repression on Gal4p at target promoters 7 . The protein is enriched in the cytoplasm <lb/>prior to stimulation and in the nucleus after the stimulation, although this cyto-nuclear <lb/>transfer does not account for the dynamics of activation 23,24 . Expression of GAL3 is itself <lb/>under Gal4p/Gal80p control (positive feedback). In addition, the sequence of GAL3 differs <lb/>between natural isolates of S. cerevisiae and this allelic variation was recently associated to <lb/>different sensitivities of the network to galactose (Lee et al. PLoS Genetics, in press). There <lb/>are multiple ways that a GAL3 variant could affect the dynamics of induction: by modifying <lb/>the production or degradation rates of the Gal3p protein or of its messenger RNA, by <lb/>changing the affinity of Gal3p to galactose or ATP, by changing the capacity of Gal3p to <lb/>dimerize, by changing the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of Gal3p molecules, or by changing the <lb/>affinity of Gal3p to Gal80p. A GAL3 variant may also affect the background expression level <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>of Gal3p prior to stimulation, which is known to be critical for network memory of prior <lb/>stimulations 25 . Thus, it is difficult to predict the functional consequence of sequence variation <lb/>in GAL3. <lb/>Using the yeast GAL3 gene as a model framework, we show here that experimental <lb/>acquisitions combined with network modeling is efficient to predict the effect of sequence <lb/>variants. The principle of the approach is to link genetic variation to informative changes of <lb/>parameter values of the model. We show that replacing natural GAL3 alleles can be sufficient <lb/>to transform a gradual response into a probabilistic activation, and the approach allowed us to <lb/>distinguish between different types of GAL3 alleles segregating in S. cerevisiae populations: <lb/>those altering the activation of Gal3p by galactose, and those altering the strength with which <lb/>activated Gal3p alleviates the transcriptional inhibition operated by Gal80p. In particular, our <lb/>approach was efficient to associate a non-synonymous SNP with a change of binding affinity <lb/>for Gal80p. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>Natural variation in GAL3 affects the dynamics of network induction <lb/>We constructed a panel of yeast strains that were all isogenic to the reference <lb/>laboratory strain BY, except for GAL3. At this locus, each strain carried an allele that was <lb/>transferred from a natural strain of the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project 26 <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 1). All strains of the panel also harboured a P GAL1 -GFP reporter of <lb/>network activity, where the promoter of the GAL1 gene controlled the expression of a GFP <lb/>fluorescent protein destabilized by a degradation signal 27,28 . GAL1 is a paralogous gene of <lb/>GAL3 29 and transcription at its promoter is commonly used as a proxy of GAL network <lb/>activity 15,20,22 . Using flow cytometry, we monitored the dynamics of network activation in <lb/>each strain (Fig. 1). This was done by first culturing cells for 3 hours in a medium containing <lb/>2% raffinose, a sugar known to be neutral on network activity, adding galactose (0.5% final <lb/>concentration), and quantifying fluorescence at multiple time points for 4 hours. Significant <lb/>differences in the dynamics of activation were observed between the strains. Those <lb/>harbouring the GAL3 NCYC361 , GAL3 K11 , GAL3 BY , GAL3 DBVPG1788 , GAL3 DBVPG1853 and <lb/>GAL3 JAY291 alleles displayed a gradual response, all cells of the population were induced and <lb/>responded with similar rate of expression, maintaining population homogeneity (see example <lb/>shown in Fig. 1a). In contrast, strains harbouring the GAL3 Y12 and GAL3 YJM978 alleles <lb/>displayed a binary response, with a transient co-existence of induced (ON) and uninduced <lb/>(OFF) cells in the population (example in Fig. 1b). <lb/>We quantified induction using two metrics: the mean level of reporter expression in <lb/>activated cells (response amplitude), and the proportion of activated cells in the population <lb/>(inducibility of the network). We observed that the response amplitude varied little among the <lb/>strains, all of them approaching steady state with comparable kinetics (Fig. 1c). In contrast, <lb/>inducibility of the network differed between strains (Fig. 1d). As expected, in strains showing <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>a gradual response, the fraction of ON cells increased significantly during the first two hours <lb/>of induction, reaching full inducibility (all cells activated) by the end of the experiment. On <lb/>the opposite, the strains showing a transient binary response displayed reduced inducibility <lb/>over time. For instance, 21% of GAL3 Y12 cells were still not induced after 250 minutes of <lb/>stimulation. These results indicate that natural genetic variation in GAL3 is sufficient to <lb/>modify the inducibility of the network and to convert a gradual response into a binary <lb/>response, or vice versa. <lb/>A quantitative model of inducibility over time <lb/>To examine what functional properties of the GAL3 gene could determine a gradual or <lb/>a binary response, we constructed a dynamic stochastic model of the network (Fig. 2a). We <lb/>based our quantitative model on the following current molecular knowledge. In absence of <lb/>galactose, a homodimer of the transcription factor Gal4p is constitutively bound to upstream <lb/>activation sites (UAS) of promoter regions of GAL genes. However, transcription is inactive <lb/>because of the homodimeric Gal80p inhibition of Gal4p 30,31 . When intracellular galactose <lb/>binds Gal3p, it changes conformation and associates with Gal80p dimers 32 , thereby releasing <lb/>Gal80p from promoters and allowing Gal4p-mediated transcriptional activation. It was <lb/>initially thought that activated Gal3p sequestered Gal80p in the cytoplasm, preventing it from <lb/>its inhibitory role in the nucleus 30 . Later studies revised this view by showing that Gal3p <lb/>molecules were not exclusively cytoplasmic 23 , that forcing Gal3p to be mostly nuclear did not <lb/>alter the kinetics of induction 23 , and that the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking were <lb/>too slow to explain the fast induction of transcription 24 . This implies a direct role of Gal3p in <lb/>promoting the dissociation of Gal80p from UAS. In addition, the galactokinase Gal1p (a <lb/>paralog of Gal3p) can also act as a co-inducer of the regulatory circuit, presumably using <lb/>similar mechanisms as Gal3p 18 . <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Our model covers the mRNA and protein species of three major players of GAL <lb/>network induction: GAL1, GAL3 and GAL80, as well as of the reporter gene. We considered <lb/>that promoters of each GAL gene could switch between an ON state (full transcription) and <lb/>an OFF state (leaky transcription) at rates that depended on the concentration of Gal80 <lb/>dimers, activated Gal3p dimers and activated Gal1p dimers. A detailed description of the <lb/>model is given in Materials and Methods and in Supplementary Text 1. Most of the <lb/>parameters of the model were fixed at values obtained from previous studies (Table S1). <lb/>Stochastic simulations reproduce the two types of induction observed experimentally <lb/>We first explored if our model captured the two types of responses of allele-<lb/>replacement strains (i.e. binary and gradual). We ran stochastic simulations 33 that accounted <lb/>for intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise (see Supplementary Text 1). We observed that <lb/>tuning the parameters related to GAL3, while keeping all other parameters constant, was <lb/>sufficient to modify inducibility and to obtain either a gradual (Fig. 2b) or a binary (Fig. 2c) <lb/>response of the network at a given concentration of galactose. In the gradual system, the <lb/>simulated single-cell trajectories were all similar; in the binary system, the simulated single-<lb/>cell trajectories bifurcated with a subset of cells having a stochastic lagging time before <lb/>responding. The single-cell value of this lag time is directly correlated with the number of <lb/>potential inducer proteins (Gal1p and Galp3p) present in the cell just before induction <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 2). This is in very good agreement with recent single-cell experiments on <lb/>galactose induction 25 . <lb/>We then studied the response predicted by the model when stimulating the network <lb/>with various concentrations of galactose while keeping model parameters constant <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 3). Inducibility increased with the concentration of galactose, with low <lb/>concentrations causing a probabilistic induction (binary) and high concentrations a <lb/></body>

			<body>deterministic one (gradual). <lb/>Two parameters related to GAL3 control network behaviour <lb/>A detailed analysis of the model showed that inducibility of the system was mainly <lb/>controlled by the average values of promoter switching rates k on and k off at the time of <lb/>induction (see Material and Methods, Supplementary Text 1 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and <lb/>4). Rates k off depend only on GAL80 and are therefore invariant to GAL3 allelic variation. <lb/>Rates k on depend on GAL3 in two ways: via Gal3p*, the amount of galactose-activated Gal3p, <lb/>and via K 3 , which corresponds to an effective concentration encompassing the dissociation <lb/>constants of the Gal3p-Gal80p interaction and of Gal3p dimerization (see Supplementary <lb/>Text 1). Gal3p* is determined by the level of Gal3p and by parameter K gal , which represents <lb/>the typical concentration of galactose needed to efficiently activate Gal3p. While K gal was <lb/>identifiable, several other GAL3-related parameters, such as those controlling the level of <lb/>Gal3p, were not and we grouped them in a meta-parameter, ρ Gal3 , which we termed the <lb/>strength of GAL3. ρ Gal3 corresponds to the invert ratio between K 3 and the mean <lb/>concentration of Gal3p at the time of induction, which depends on the leaky transcription rate, <lb/>the translation rate and the degradation rates of GAL3 mRNA and protein product. <lb/>This formalism made the network sensitive to only two identifiable GAL3-related <lb/>parameters, K gal and ρ Gal3 . At a fixed concentration of galactose induction, high ρ Gal3 values <lb/>correspond to high numbers of Gal3p dimers that can rapidly be activated to release Gal80 <lb/>repression. The model predicted that high values of ρ Gal3 would generate a gradual response <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 5a) because the number of potential activators was high enough in each <lb/>cell to rapidly trigger the GAL1/GAL3-mediated positive feedback loop. In contrast, low <lb/>values of ρ Gal3 would generate a binary response (Supplementary Fig. 5b) because the number <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>of activators is more stochastic, with many cells having too few initial Gal1p or Gal3p dimers <lb/>to directly trigger the response. These cells need a lag time before fast activation (Fig.2b,c and <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 2). The other important parameter, K gal , corresponded to a threshold of <lb/>galactose concentration below which induction was limited and favoured a binary response, <lb/>and above which induction was efficient and favoured a gradual response (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. 3c). In summary, both ρ Gal3 and K gal values can determine whether the network adopts a <lb/>gradual or a binary response at a given concentration of galactose induction. <lb/>Linking GAL3 alleles to specific parameter values <lb/>In order to test the predictions of the model, we measured the transcriptional response <lb/>of the GAL3 BY , GAL3 Y12 and GAL3 YJM978 strains at different galactose concentrations (0.05%, <lb/>0.1% and 0.5%). Our experimental observations confirmed that the inducibility increases with <lb/>galactose concentration (Fig. 3a). We then used this experimental data to infer parameters <lb/>! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# for each of the three strains. This was done by selecting a set of parameters <lb/>that minimized a global chi2-score of deviation between the measured and predicted fractions <lb/>of induced cells at different times after induction and for the different galactose <lb/>concentrations (for details, see methods and Supplementary Text 1). To evaluate the <lb/>usefulness of the inferred parameter values, we used the fitted model to predict the behaviour <lb/>of each strain at a galactose concentration that was not used for model training (0.2%) (Fig. <lb/>3b). Finally, to test model predictions, we experimentally monitored GAL3 BY , GAL3 Y12 and <lb/>GAL3 YJM978 induction at 0.2% galactose. Without any additional fitting procedure, we <lb/>observed that inducibility (fraction of activated cells over time) differed between strains in a <lb/>way that was entirely consistent with model predictions. Thus, the differences among <lb/>parameter values assigned to the different GAL3 alleles are relevant outside the specific <lb/>experimental conditions used for parameters estimation. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Natural GAL3 alleles map to distinct locations of the parameter space <lb/>We sought to classify GAL3 alleles based on the parameter values assigned to them. <lb/>We made experimental measurements on two additional strains (GAL3 NCYC361 and <lb/>GAL3 DBVPG1788 ) and we determined best-fit ρ Gal3 and K gal values to them as for the three <lb/>strains described above. This data and the corresponding fitted models are shown in <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 6. Fig. 4a,b shows the obtained parameters, ! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# , normalized <lb/>by the corresponding values of our reference strain GAL3 BY . Different data points represent <lb/>results obtained by applying the inference process to models with different GAL3-<lb/>independent parameters (see Supplementary Text 1). <lb/>The fold change of a parameter between two different strains is indicative of the <lb/>functional nature of the genetic variations between the two GAL3 alleles. In agreement with <lb/>the model predictions (Supplementary Fig. 3), we observed that more gradual strains <lb/>(GAL3 NCYC361 and GAL3 DBVPG1788 ) display a high GAL3 strength ! !&quot;#! and a low &apos;typical&apos; <lb/>galactose concentration ! !&quot;# . Interestingly, we observed that ! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# can be de-<lb/>correlated. In particular, although both GAL3 YJM978 and GAL3 Y12 strains were binary <lb/>responders at all galactose concentrations tested, the model attributed this behaviour to <lb/>different functional effects: a low sensitivity to galactose (high K gal ) for the Gal3 protein <lb/>originating from YJM978 and a reduced strength of the GAL3 gene originating from Y12. <lb/>Thus, the induction specificities of the strains can be attributed to distinct GAL3-related <lb/>parameters. <lb/>To address the direct relationship between the network properties (gradual or binary <lb/>response) and the GAL3-related parameters, we positioned each of the tested strains within a <lb/>phenotypic landscape according to their relative ! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# parameters (Fig 4c). <lb/>According to our model, ! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# parameters are sufficient to predict the behaviour <lb/></body>

			<body>(gradual or binary) associated with a given GAL3 allele at a given concentration of galactose. <lb/>As an illustration of these predictions, we specifically observed the dynamics of <lb/>transcriptional activation of the network for the strain GAL3 DBVPG1788 (Fig. 4d). The position <lb/>of the GAL3 DBVPG1788 allele on the phenotypic landscape corresponded to a transient <lb/>probabilistic activation at low concentration ([gal]=0.05%) converted into a gradual response <lb/>at higher concentration ([gal]=0.1% and [gal]=0.5%). <lb/>Variation in induction dynamics is consistent with variation in diauxic shift decision <lb/>The physiological relevance of the GAL network regulation is to switch from the <lb/>consumption of glucose (the preferred carbon source) to the consumption of galactose when <lb/>glucose supply is running out. This diauxic switch is controlled not only by galactose <lb/>induction but also by glucose-mediated repression. When both sugars are present, their <lb/>relative concentration ratio determines whether cells activate the switch or not 20,21,34 . At some <lb/>ratio values, only a fraction of the cells are induced, even at the steady-state. Given this dual <lb/>regulation, the propensity of a strain to activate GAL metabolism can be quantified by <lb/>measuring the fraction of induced cells after a prolonged period (8 hours) of simultaneous <lb/>induction (by galactose) and repression (by glucose). If this measurement is repeated at a <lb/>given concentration of galactose and various concentrations of glucose, a useful score can be <lb/>computed (called &apos;decision threshold&apos; hereafter): the concentration of glucose needed to <lb/>maintain half the population of cells in the repressed (OFF) state (Fig. 5a). A high decision <lb/>threshold corresponds to an early activation of GAL genes during the diauxic shift. <lb/>A previous study identified GAL3 as an important genetic determinant for this <lb/>decision: the concentration ratio at which cells turn GAL expression ON differs between <lb/>strains harbouring different natural alleles of GAL3 (Lee et al. PLoS Genetics, in press). We <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>asked if this variation was correlated with the variation observed on the dynamics of network <lb/>induction. We chose four strains that showed different decision thresholds because of <lb/>different GAL3 alleles (Fig 5b) (Lee et al. PLoS Genetics, in press) and we monitored their <lb/>dynamics of induction at three different concentrations of galactose (with no glucose). We <lb/>then used our model to assign ! !&quot;#! and ! !&quot;# parameter values to each strain. Experimental <lb/>data and model fitting are shown in Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 7. We used the inferred <lb/>parameter values to visualize the four strains in the parameter space where binary and gradual <lb/>responses upon stimulation at [gal] = 0.25% are delimited (Fig. 5d). Remarkably, the <lb/>properties of induction dynamics in absence of glucose were fully consistent with the decision <lb/>threshold during diauxic shift from glucose to galactose. Strains having a low decision <lb/>threshold, such as GAL3 YJM421 , displayed a transient binary response, and strain GAL3 BC187 <lb/>had a high decision threshold and responded gradually. Coordinates of strains in the <lb/>parameter space indicate that ! !&quot;#! values are highly informative on the decision threshold <lb/>(Fig. 5d). Thus, mapping allelic variation to dynamic parameters of induction is also useful to <lb/>understand trade-offs that are observed at steady-state. <lb/>A quantitative parameter change predicts a role of H352D SNP on Gal3:Gal80 complex <lb/>formation <lb/>We noticed that, at position 352 of the Gal3p protein, all natural strains harboured an <lb/>aspartic acid, whereas the reference laboratory strain BY harboured a histidine. This aspartic <lb/>acid was also conserved in S. mikatae, S. paradoxus and S. uvarum protein sequences 35 . <lb/>Given the prevalence of this aspartic acid, we hypothesized that a single H352D amino-acid <lb/>change could have consequences on Gal3p regulatory function. <lb/>To test this, we generated an artificial GAL3 BY-H352D allele by introducing the H352D <lb/>mutation in the GAL3 BY strain and we monitored the dynamics of induction of the resulting <lb/></body>

			<body>strain. At similar concentrations of galactose, induction was faster for the modified strain than <lb/>for the original strain (compare Fig. 6a with Fig. 2a). We then used our model to make <lb/>functional predictions. We fitted our model to experimental data of induction as described <lb/>above for natural alleles. Induction dynamics of the modified strain were fully explained by <lb/>preserving parameter ! !&quot;# and increasing ! !&quot;#! (Fig. 6b). This suggested that the H352D <lb/>mutation did not affect activation of Gal3p by galactose but rather the strength of Gal3p, <lb/>which summarizes six biochemical features: the basal level of GAL3 transcription prior to <lb/>induction, its translation and degradation rate, the degradation rate of its coding mRNA, its <lb/>capacity to homodimerize and the affinity of activated Gal3p for Gal80p. <lb/>How the implicated SNP could change either the leaky transcription level prior to <lb/>induction or the transcription rate during induction is difficult to imagine. In addition, the <lb/>amino-acid change was not surrounded by any particular peptide motif, nor was it located at <lb/>the extremity of the protein. This did not support for an effect on translation or degradation <lb/>rates. Thus, the most plausible interpretation of the parameter change of the model was that <lb/>the H352D modification would increase either the capacity of Gal3p* to dimerize or the <lb/>affinity of the Gal3p* dimer for Gal80p. <lb/>To explore these possibilities, we analyzed the structure of the heterotetramer <lb/>[Gal3p*] 2 -[Gal80p] 2 that was previously solved 32 . We made three important observations. <lb/>First, His352 is located at the binding interface of the Gal3p* dimer with the Gal80p dimer <lb/>(Fig. 6c), and distant from the pocket containing galactose and ATP. Secondly, it is spatially <lb/>close to the Gal80p site where the acidic domain of Gal4p is known to bind 36 . Finally, the <lb/>Gal80p dimer exhibits a positive electrostatic surface potential in the vicinity of Gal3p-<lb/>His352, suggesting that the replacement of the neutral His352 by a negatively charged <lb/>aspartic acid would stabilize the Gal3p*-Gal80p complex. Stabilization refers here to a gain in <lb/>thermodynamic stability relative to the Gal4p-Gal80p complex, or in other words, to a <lb/></body>

A molecular dynamics simulation of the <lb/>Asp352 mutant (in a model system of the Gal3p*-Gal80 complex) indicates that two <lb/>positively charged amino acids, Gal3p-Arg362 and Gal80p-Lys287, are able to form direct <lb/>salt bridges with Asp352 (Fig. 6d).

Also, the polar solution (water + counter ions) could partially reduce the <lb/>stabilization effect of the H352D mutation because residue 352 is better solvated in the <lb/>Gal3p* dimer than in the Gal3p*-Gal80p tetramer. Thus, to quantify a possible stabilization <lb/>effect of the H352D mutation, we computed the change in the Gibbs free energy difference, <lb/>ΔΔG sub = ΔG sub <lb/>D352 -ΔG sub <lb/>H352 , with the aid of the thermodynamic cycle depicted in Fig. 6e. <lb/>The actual free energy calculations (see Methods) yielded ΔΔG sub = -2.8 ± 0.9 kcal/mol, <lb/>which indicates that the H352D mutation indeed increases the thermodynamic stability of the <lb/>Gal3p*-Gal80p complex with respect to the Gal4p-Gal80p complex. Thus, as predicted by the <lb/>dynamic model of network induction, the H352D mutation increases the cellular response by <lb/>facilitating the formation of the complex. <lb/></body>

			<body>DISCUSSION <lb/>We experimentally monitored the induction dynamics of the yeast GAL network in the <lb/>context of natural genetic variation at the GAL3 gene. We built a stochastic model of the <lb/>network and used it to link GAL3 alleles to functional network parameters. This approach <lb/>discriminated alleles that increased the strength of activated Gal3p (e.g. of strains NCYC361 <lb/>and DBVPG1788) from alleles that desensitized Gal3p to galactose activation (e.g. of strain <lb/>YJM978). Alleles showing different glucose/galactose trade-offs at equilibrium displayed <lb/>different dynamics of induction, and they were associated to different strength of activated <lb/>Gal3p. Our approach also predicted a functional effect of a single non-synonymous SNP that <lb/>was validated by atomistic simulations of the binding interface between Gal3p and Gal80p <lb/>dimers. These results provide further details on the yeast GAL system and, perhaps more <lb/>importantly, they constitute a proof-of-concept of the feasibility and usefulness of linking <lb/>genetic variants to model parameters. <lb/>Genetic variability of the yeast GAL network <lb/>Our in vivo and in silico analysis of the induction kinetics of yeast GAL activation <lb/>reveals properties of this system and how it is sensitive to genetic variation. Previously, <lb/>several computational models of the network have been proposed, usually in an effort to <lb/>understand the properties of the system at steady-state 11,15,18 . Particularly, they highlighted the <lb/>important role of Gal3p, Gal1p and Gal80p-mediated feedback loops. Our in silico analysis <lb/>suggests that the gradual or binary kinetic response is mainly controlled by the initial number <lb/>of repressors (Gal80p) and inducers (Gal1p and Gal3p), the efficacy of galactose to activate <lb/>the inducers and the efficiency of the activated inducers to release the effect of repressors. In <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>particular, a low mean number of inducers at the time of induction may lead to high cell-to-<lb/>cell variability in their actual number. Cells with few inducers (as compared to repressors) <lb/>display a lag time before responding, leading to a binary response pattern at the population <lb/>level. This prediction from our model is fully consistent with recent experiments that tracked <lb/>the induction of the network at the single-cell level and showed that the initial concentrations <lb/>of Gal1p and Gal3p are predictive of the transient bimodal response 25 . We also observed that <lb/>feedback loops were important to control the strength of cell-to-cell variability before <lb/>induction (Gal80-mediated negative feedback) and the duration of lag times (Gal3/Gal1-<lb/>mediated positive feedbacks), which agrees with the previous observation that disabling the <lb/>Gal80p and Gal3p feedback loops can transform a gradual response into a binary one 14 . Our <lb/>results on GAL3 genetic variants also complement previous genetic manipulations of the <lb/>feedback loops, where their effect on bimodality was tested by modulating promoter <lb/>activities 14,15,18,19 . Here, we showed that a non-synonymous variant affecting Gal3p:Gal80p <lb/>interaction directly affects the dynamics of transient bimodality. This is a novel <lb/>experimentally-based observation that is totally coherent with the conclusions of Venturelli et <lb/>al. who showed computationally that steady-state bimodality of the network could rely on <lb/>protein-protein binding affinities 18 . <lb/>We also observed that genetic variation at GAL3 could affect its propensity to be <lb/>activated by galactose/ATP binding. In particular, the GAL3 YJM978 allele was associated with <lb/>increased values of the ! !&quot;# parameter (more galactose needed for its activation). This allele <lb/>harboured 3 non-synonymous SNPs: M179I, R312I and H352D. As shown above, H352D is <lb/>found in all natural alleles that we tested and it therefore does not explain a change in ! !&quot;# <lb/>specifically for GAL3 YJM978 . According to the structure of the Gal3p:Gal80p tetramer <lb/>complexed with galactose and ATP 32 , the other two polymorphic sites do not map close to the <lb/></body>

			<body>pocket containing the ligands. Met179 is located at the surface of the complex, distant from <lb/>any binding interface and distant from the bound galactose (30 Å) and ATP (25 Å). The <lb/>mutational effect of the rather conservative amino acid change (methionine to isoleucine) on <lb/>the ! !&quot;# parameter might therefore be negligible. In contrast, the non-conservative arginine to <lb/>isoleucine mutation at site 312 could influence ! !&quot;# in several ways: first, the positively <lb/>charged arginine contributes favorably to the binding of the negatively charged ATP through <lb/>long-range electrostatic interactions. The charge-neutral Ile312 variant lacks this favorable <lb/>interaction and may have lower affinity for ATP, thereby penalizing activation by the two <lb/>ligands. Second, residues Arg312 of the two Gal3p units are in direct contact with each other, <lb/>and the non-conservative R312I change may affect the dimerization of Gal3p. Lavy et al. 32 <lb/>reported that, in absence of galactose, Gal3p is monomeric in solution and adopts an open <lb/>conformation that differs from the conformation generating the Gal3p:Gal3p dimeric interface <lb/>found upon interaction with Gal80p. If the R312I modification alters Gal3p dimerization, this <lb/>could modify the overall activation by galactose because these processes are coupled. <lb/>We observed that genetic variation of the strength of activated Gal3p (! !&quot;#! ), <lb/>estimated from the dynamic properties of network activation, was correlated with variation of <lb/>the glucose/galactose trade-off at steady state. This implies that the two traits co-evolve in <lb/>natural populations of S. cerevisiae. Given the relatively short time-scale of network <lb/>induction, mild differences in the dynamics of activation alone are unlikely to cause fitness <lb/>differences unless environmental galactose concentrations are highly dynamic. In contrast, <lb/>variation in the sensitivity of the network to the ratio of external sugars corresponds to the <lb/>triggering of an adaptive metabolic process, which is highly related to fitness even for slow <lb/>environmental changes. The induction dynamics that we observed on short time-scales are <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>probably not themselves under selection, but they provide valuable information on the <lb/>molecular mechanism affecting a fitness-related trait operating on longer time scales. <lb/>The H352D variant is interesting in this regard. At this position in Gal3p, a histidine <lb/>residue was found in all laboratory strains (BY4741, CEN.PK, D273-10B, FL100, FY1679, <lb/>JK9-3d, SEY6210, W303, X2180-1A, YPH499), while nearly all natural isolates as well as <lb/>distant species possess an aspartic acid. Our results showed the importance of this aspartic <lb/>acid for interaction with Gal80p, which suggests that its conservation in wild population <lb/>results from purifying selection. The presence of slightly-deleterious mutations in laboratory <lb/>strains is well-known. Examples from the reference strain BY/S288c include mutations in <lb/>AMN1 37 , BUL2 38 , ERC1 39 , FLO8 40 , GPA1 37 and HAP1 41 . These mutations likely resulted <lb/>from a release of purifying selection caused by strong population bottlenecks when <lb/>propagating yeast on petri dishes. As for the genes listed above, the implication for GAL3 is <lb/>that most mechanistic studies refer to a &quot;Wild-Type&quot; protein that is in fact a slightly-<lb/>hypomorphic allele not found in nature. <lb/>We also noted cases where the specificities of a GAL3 allele in the context of the BY <lb/>strain did not reflect the properties of the donor strain. An extreme example of this was the <lb/>GAL3 DBVPG1853 allele which improved the response of the BY strain (Fig. 1d) while the <lb/>DBVPG1853 strain itself did not respond at all to galactose (not shown), presumably because <lb/>of genetic defects in other genes. Background-specific effects are common and should be <lb/>taken into account when interpreting the functional impact of natural alleles in their original <lb/>strain context 42 . <lb/>Linking DNA variants to model parameters: feasibility and potential <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>We developed our approach using a model system, the yeast GAL network, which was <lb/>an ideal context for investigation: molecular players were well known, important network <lb/>properties had been previously described, genetic engineering could be used to study the <lb/>effect of a single gene in an otherwise isogenic background, and experimental measurements <lb/>were relatively cheap. If network modeling had provided no added value in such a context, it <lb/>would be hard to imagine how it could be useful in more complex frameworks. We report that <lb/>it did: observing different dynamics experimentally was not sufficient to make functional <lb/>inferences, but combining data and modeling was. The concept is therefore fruitful and it is <lb/>interesting now to consider how it can be extended to other biological systems. <lb/>First, it is important to realize that inference is based on the wealth of information <lb/>contained in the dynamics of activation. Evidently, studying the system at equilibrium would <lb/>not be sufficient. Mapping DNA variants to model parameters is therefore promising for <lb/>systems where time-course data is available. <lb/>Second, even in the simple context of our study, not all parameters of the model were <lb/>identifiable and it was necessary to aggregate several of them into a meta-parameter (! !&quot;#! ). <lb/>We admit that this constitutes a limit of the approach: when the H352D SNP was linked to <lb/>this meta-parameter, additional assumptions were needed to infer biochemical effects. Similar <lb/>difficulties will likely be encountered in other systems and the identifiability and sensitivity <lb/>analysis of the model is therefore crucial to determine the nature of biological information <lb/>that can be retrieved by the approach. <lb/>Third, our method here was to infer function and then to validate a prediction by <lb/>exploring the structural data of a protein complex. Depending on the system under <lb/>consideration and the data available, it may be judicious to reverse the approach: scanning <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>protein structures first in order to identify variants modifying binding affinities and then <lb/>studying these variants specifically using experimental measurements and model-fitting. This <lb/>way, a parameter change is first inferred from structural data and a dynamic model of the <lb/>network then allows one to predict its phenotypic effect. The SAAP database 6 , which registers <lb/>structurally-relevant variants of human proteins, may constitute a very helpful resource to do <lb/>this. <lb/>Fourth, while we based our approach on cell population distributions, tracking the <lb/>response dynamics of individual cells over time is also possible 25 and can provide more <lb/>information on the network response. In other contexts, such methods had been very useful to <lb/>infer parameters associated to individual cells 43 . A variant may then be associated to one <lb/>parameter by a whole distribution of values, which likely carries more information than a <lb/>single scalar value as presented here. <lb/>Fifth, additional work is now needed to extend the approach to more than one gene. At <lb/>the level of an entire network, the overall genotype of the individual is a combination of <lb/>alleles. The number of such combinatorial genotypes of the network segregating in natural <lb/>populations can be very large and mapping this diversity to the parameter space would be <lb/>very interesting. In particular, models accounting for genetic changes might predict and <lb/>explain genetic interactions (epistasis) within the network. The challenge to achieve this will <lb/>likely reside in the number of free parameters: if the genotype is allowed to vary at too-many <lb/>genes, parameters cannot be constrained efficiently. Mapping variants one gene at a time, as <lb/>we did here, and then in combination would maintain this necessary constraint while <lb/>evaluating epistasis. A more difficult task would be to infer the contribution of genes that are <lb/>external to the network while nonetheless affecting its behavior (e.g. by modifying widely <lb/>transcription rates or the stability of proteins, or cross-talks with other networks). Studying <lb/>these factors by our approach is only possible after they are identified and connected to the <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>network. Their identification can be obtained by genetic mapping. For example, we recently <lb/>identified a locus on yeast chromosome V that affects the variability of the GAL response at <lb/>transient times of activation 28 . Once identified, these factors must be integrated in the network <lb/>model, which may be a complex task. <lb/>Network modeling is expected to help the development of personalized medicine and <lb/>the fact that it is possible, in a yeast system, to personalize model parameters according to <lb/>DNA variants is encouraging. Can the approach described here be applied to human variants? <lb/>This requires overcoming several difficulties that could be avoided in our framework. First, <lb/>most regulatory networks of human systems are incompletely known. Second, most of these <lb/>networks comprise numerous genes, implying many model parameters and, possibly, too-<lb/>many degrees of freedom for adjustments and identifiability issues. The first task is therefore <lb/>a careful identifiability and sensitivity analysis of the model and, as much as possible, a <lb/>reduction of its complexity. The work of Zhao et al. 44 is encouraging in this regard. The <lb/>authors studied the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization network controlling entry <lb/>in apoptosis. Their model comprised ~50 parameters and ~20 molecular species, but the <lb/>network critical behaviour (bifurcation point) was sensitive to less than half of the parameters. <lb/>The authors then searched for enrichment of cancer mutations in protein domains involved in <lb/>molecular interactions and they used molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the affinity <lb/>changes caused by these mutations. Interestingly, most mutations that were predicted to affect <lb/>sensitive parameters of the model caused a significant change of affinity in the expected <lb/>direction, illustrating that the model was able to highlight relevant vulnerabilities. Similarly, <lb/>Nijhout et al. 45 studied a model of the folate-mediated one carbon metabolism system. They <lb/>reported that human mutations that strongly perturb enzymatic activities could have little <lb/>phenotypic effect if they targeted parameters that are poorly sensitive. Another type of <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>difficulties when studying human networks are experimental limitations: manipulating human <lb/>cells needs more time and funds than manipulating yeast; replacing alleles of specific genes is <lb/>possible via CRISPR/Cas9 editing but the large physical size of human genes as well as the <lb/>functional redundancy between paralogues can be problematic; and setting up dynamic <lb/>experimental acquisitions is often not straightforward. Thus, applying our approach to a <lb/>minimal network in human cells compatible with genetic editing and time-series acquisitions <lb/>will probably constitute an important step in the near future. <lb/></body>

			<body>METHODS <lb/>Yeast strains and plasmids. <lb/>The strains used is this study are listed in Table S3. We used the strain BY4711 (GY145, <lb/>isogenic to s288c) as BY reference strain. The P GAL1 GFP reporter cassette was obtained from <lb/>plasmid pGY338 previously described 28 . pGY338 was linearized by NheI and integrated at <lb/>the HIS3 locus of BY4711 to create strains GY1648 and GY1649, two independent <lb/>transformants. To replace endogenous GAL3 BY allele by natural variants in GY1648 strain, we <lb/>PCR amplified the TRP1-GAL3 locus of natural wild isolates using primers 1D28(5&apos;-<lb/>AGAGGCGGTGGAGATATTCCTTATG-3&apos;) <lb/>and <lb/>1D56(5&apos;-<lb/>ACGTCCGCTATACCTTCGTTTTCTC-3&apos;). The endogenous locus was then replaced by in <lb/>vivo homologous recombination and positive transformants were selected on SD-TRP plates. <lb/>GAL3 NCYC361 , GAL3 K11 , GAL3 Y12 , GAL3 DBVPG1788 , GAL3 DBVPG1853 , GAL3 YJM978 , GAL3 JAY291 <lb/>were PCR amplified from NCYC3451, NCYC3452, NCYC3445, NCYC3311, NCYC3313, <lb/>NCYC3458 (wild isolates from the Saccaromyces Genome Resequensing Project, SGRP 26,46 ) <lb/>and JAY291 (Argueso et al. 47 ), respectively. The strains used to characterize the effect of <lb/>natural variants on galactose response were GY1648, GY1689, GY1692, GY1695, GY1698, <lb/>GY1704, GY1707 and GY1713, all isogenic to S288c except for GAL3 BY , GAL3 NCYC361 , <lb/>GAL3 K11 , GAL3 Y12 , GAL3 DBVPG1788 , GAL3 DBVPG1853 , GAL3 YJM978 , GAL3 JAY291 , respectively. <lb/>Strains genotype was verified by PCR and either high-resolution melting curves, restriction <lb/>fragment length polymorphism typing or sequencing.

The mutated GAL3 BY-H352D allele was synthesized by <lb/>GeneScript and subcloned into pGY409 using MscI-BstEII restriction sites, generating <lb/>plasmid pGY418. The TRP1-GAL3 BY-H352D locus was PCR-amplified from pGY418 using <lb/>primers 1D28 and 1D56 and transformed into GY1649 to create strain GY2009. Genotype <lb/>was validated by PCR and sequencing. Strains of figure 5 were MPJ125-E06 (GAL3 BY ), <lb/>MPJ143-H01 (GAL3 YJM428 ), MPJ143-F01 (GAL3 YJM421 ) and MPJ125-A07 (GAL3 BC187 ) which <lb/>were described in another study (Lee et al. PLoS Genetics, in press); they all derived from a <lb/>S288c hoΔ::GAL1pr-YFP-mTagBFP2-kanMX4; gal3∆::hphNT1 parental strain. <lb/>Galactose response measurements. <lb/>Liquid cultures in synthetic medium with 2% raffinose (Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o amino acids <lb/>6.7g/L, Raffinose 2%, Dropout Mix 2g/L, adjusted to pH=5.8) were inoculated with a single <lb/>colony and incubated overnight, then diluted to OD600 = 0.1 (synthetic medium, 2% <lb/>raffinose) and grown for 3 to 6 hours. The galactose induction experiments were carried out in <lb/>96-well sterile microplates using a Freedom EVO200 liquid handler (Tecan) equipped with a <lb/>96-channel pipetting head (MCA), a high precision 8-channel pipetting arm (LiHa), a robotic <lb/>manipulator arm (RoMa) and a MOI-6 incubator (Tecan). All robotic steps were programmed <lb/>in Evoware v2.5.4.0 (Tecan). Cells were resuspended in synthetic medium with 2% raffinose <lb/>and the appropriate galactose concentration (0.01, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5%) and grown for the <lb/>desired time (from 0 to 250 minutes). Cells were then washed with PBS1X, incubated for 8 <lb/>min in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature, followed by 12 min of incubation in <lb/>PBS supplemented with Glycine 0.1M at room temperature and finally resuspended in PBS. <lb/>They were then analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer to record <lb/></body>

Each set of data is representative of the results of two independent <lb/>experiments (each comprising 3 technical replicates). <lb/>Flow cytometry data was analysed using the flowCore package from Bioconductor 48 . Cells of <lb/>homogeneous size were dynamically gated as follows: (i) removal of events with saturated <lb/>signals (FSC, SSC or FL1 = 1023 or = 0), (ii) correction by subtracting the mean(FL1) at t=0 <lb/>to each FL1 values, (iii) computation of a density kernel of FSC, SSC values to define a <lb/>perimeter of peak density containing 60% of events, (iv) cell gating using this perimeter, (v) <lb/>removal of samples containing less than 3,000 cells at the end of the procedure and (vi) <lb/>correction of the data according to an eventual experimental bias during cytometer <lb/>acquisitions. For the twelve time-points (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 130, 160, 205 and 250 <lb/>minutes) experimental design, the time course for a given strain was acquired on different <lb/>plates on the flow cytometer. In order to correct an eventual plate effect, we systematically <lb/>included 24 replicates on each plate acquired on flow cytometer. We then tested the fixed <lb/>effect of plates using an ANOVA. The FL1 values of each cell were subsequently corrected <lb/>according to the plate offset of the ANOVA. For the six time-points (0, 30, 60, 80, 130 and <lb/>210 minutes) experimental design, all the timepoints being acquired on the same experimental <lb/>plate, we did not apply the normalization filter. The GFP expression values presented here in <lb/>arbitrary units were the FL1 signal of the retained cells (normalized for the plate effect, if <lb/>required). <lb/>Analysis of flow cytometry distributions. All statistical analysis were done using R (version <lb/>3.2.4). <lb/>Calculation of the response amplitude. The response amplitude Α was defined as the mean of <lb/>P GAL1 GFP expression in activated cells.

(! !&quot;&quot; ) = ! ! !&quot;&quot; + ! ! !&quot; !). If the distribution was unimodal, we calculated: <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>Α = ! !&quot;&quot; . Otherwise, bimodal distributions were considered as mixtures of two normal <lb/>distributions, such as: ! (! !&quot;&quot; ) = ! !&quot;&quot; ! ! !&quot;&quot;, ! !&quot;&quot; + ! !&quot; ! ! !&quot;, ! !&quot; , with Α = ! !&quot; . We <lb/>used the function mixtools::normalmixEM() to calculate Α for mixture distributions. <lb/>Calculation of inducibility. Inducibility was defined as the proportion of ON cells in the <lb/>population. The threshold t between OFF and ON cells was calculated as follows: i) a subset <lb/>of OFF cells (all cells acquired at t=0min) and ON cells (activated cells belonging to <lb/>unimodal distributions, acquired at the latest time point of the experiments) was defined for <lb/>each experiments , ii) the mean and standard deviation were extracted from each OFF and ON <lb/>normal distributions using the function mixtools::normalmixEM(), iii) these <lb/>parameters were used to determine t such as ℙ ! !&quot; &lt; ! = ℙ(! !&quot;&quot; &gt; !) , with ! !&quot; the <lb/>observed fluorescence FL1 in ON_cells and ! !&quot;&quot; the observed fluorescence FL1 in <lb/>OFF_cells, iv) we finally calculated Ι = <lb/>!&quot;_!&quot;##$ !&quot;!!! <lb/>!&quot;_!&quot;##(!&quot;!#$) !for each time point, for each strain. <lb/>Stochastic modeling <lb/>We model the stochastic gene expression of GAL1, GAL3, GAL80 and of the reporter gene <lb/>(under a GAL1 promoter). For each gene we account for the status of the promoter (ON/OFF) <lb/>and for the production and degradation of mRNAs and proteins. In addition, for the reporter <lb/>gene, we account for the maturation of the fluorescent protein. The promoter switching rate <lb/>from ON to OFF for gene i is driven by GAL80p: ! ! <lb/>!&quot;&quot; = ! ! <lb/>!&quot;&quot; <lb/>!&quot;#!&quot;! <lb/>! !&quot; <lb/>! ! ! <lb/>with n i the <lb/>number of strong GAL4p binding sites in the promoter.

Most <lb/>of the parameters of the model (except K 1 , K 3 , K 80 and K gal ) were fixed based on the literature <lb/>(see Table S1 in Supplementary Text 1). The model had 7 GAL3-dependent parameters: α 3 <lb/>(leaky transcription rate), γ 3 (translation rate), β 3 (mRNA degradation rate), µ 3 (protein <lb/>degradation/dilution rate), Δα 3 (full transcription rate), K 3 and K gal . The phenotypic response <lb/>of a strain (gradual vs binary) at a given galactose concentration mainly depends on K gal and <lb/>on the strength of GAL3 defined by ρ Gal3 =α 3 γ 3 /(β 3 µ 3 K 3 ) (see main text and Supplementary <lb/>Text 1). For a given set of parameters, the stochastic dynamics of galactose induction was <lb/>simulated using the stochastic simulation algorithm from Gillespie 33 . The system was first <lb/>allowed to reach steady-state at [gal]=0.
