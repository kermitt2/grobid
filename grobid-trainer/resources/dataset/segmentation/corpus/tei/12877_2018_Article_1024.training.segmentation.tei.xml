Our main aim is to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent physical activity <lb/>program, versus regular medical practice, on reverting pre-frailty status among the elderly, 12 months post-intervention. <lb/>Methods: Randomized parallel group multicenter clinical trial located in primary care setting, among non-dependent <lb/>and pre-frail patients &gt; 70 years old, including 190 patients (95 intervention, 95 control group). Intervention: <lb/>Multicomponent physical activity program (MEFAP, for its acronym in Spanish) with twelve 1.5 h-weekly sessions <lb/>comprised of: 1. Informative session; 2. Exercises for improving aerobic resistance, muscle strength, propioception-<lb/>balance and flexibility; and 3. Handing out of at-home exercise chart (twice/week). Main variable: pre-frailty according <lb/>to the Fried phenotype. Secondary variables: sociodemographic, clinical and functional variables; exercise program <lb/>adherence, patient satisfaction with the program and quality of life. We will perform an intention-to-treat analysis by <lb/>comparing the retrogression from pre-frailty (1 or 2 Fried criteria) to robust status (0 Fried criteria) by the end of the <lb/>intervention, 6 months and 12 months post-intervention. The accumulated incidence in each group will be calculated, <lb/>as well as the relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) with their corresponding 95% confidence <lb/>intervals. Protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee Hospital la Paz. <lb/>Discussion: Within the context of regular clinical practice, our results will provide evidence regarding the effects of <lb/>exercise interventions on frailty among pre-frail older adults, a key population given their significant potential for <lb/>functional, physical, and mental health improvement. <lb/>Trial registration: NCT03568084.

			<body>Background <lb/>Worldwide, Spain enjoys one of the highest life expect-<lb/>ancies and population projections point to a continuing <lb/>population ageing process [1]. <lb/>The 2012 European region committee for The World <lb/>Health Organization approved the &quot;Strategy and action <lb/>plan for healthy aging in Europe 2012-2020&quot; [2]. Simi-<lb/>larly, the European Union, within the framework pro-<lb/>gram Horizon 2020, launched a program for &quot;the <lb/>cooperation for innovation in Europe regarding active <lb/>and healthy ageing.&quot; One of the program&apos;s pillars of ac-<lb/>tion is the prevention, screening, and early diagnosis of <lb/>frailty and functional deficit [3]. <lb/>In the context of healthy ageing, the older person stays <lb/>healthy and remains independent longer thus reducing <lb/>the family burden in terms of informal care. The oppos-<lb/>ite scenario is functional decline, i.e., frailty, defined as a <lb/>decrease in the homeostatic reserve of the individual <lb/>leading to increased vulnerability to stressors. Frailty is a <lb/>reliable predictor of short, medium, and longterm ad-<lb/>verse health events such as falls, multimorbidity, <lb/>institutionalization, hospitalization, and even death [4]. <lb/>Frailty prevention and control is currently an important <lb/>public health challenge clearly associated to the hastened <lb/>population ageing. <lb/>Frailty and pre-frailty are commonly found among the <lb/>elderly. A recent systematic review estimates that about <lb/>10 and 44% of 65-year-olds or older are frail or pre-frail, <lb/>respectively [5]. It is worth underlining that the frailty syn-<lb/>drome is reversible, that is, a frail individual can turn the <lb/>clock back and become robust again as long as frailty is <lb/>detected and treated at the onset [6]. Therefore, identify-<lb/>ing and treating pre-frailty is effective in preventing dis-<lb/>ability and other adverse events, improving quality of life, <lb/>and reducing care-related costs [7, 8]. Further, pre-frailty <lb/>is the most appropriate time to implement interventions <lb/>by the health care system as it is when the best patient re-<lb/>sponse to these interventions can be expected [9]. <lb/>Lowering frailty rates requires reducing inactivity, one <lb/>of its main risk factors [10]. Both a 2012 and a 2014 <lb/>meta-analysis studying fragile individuals showed that <lb/>physical activity delays and even reverses frailty and dis-<lb/>ability [11, 12], improves cognitive status and promotes <lb/>emotional well-being and socialization [13]. Specifically, <lb/>multicomponent physical exercise programs comprised <lb/>of muscle strength development, cardiovascular endur-<lb/>ance, and joint mobility and balance, are the most effect-<lb/>ive interventions to delay disability and other adverse <lb/>events as well as to maintain the highest degree of inde-<lb/>pendence possible for each individual [14]. However, <lb/>how different trials measure interventions varies which <lb/>difficults results comparisons. Therefore, physical activ-<lb/>ity, insofar as it prevents and even reverses early stages <lb/>of frailty, has the potential of averting falls, disability, and <lb/>improving quality of life [15]. Not to be dismissed, mood <lb/>enhancement and the socialization inherent to group ex-<lb/>ercise programs may also contribute to these benefits. <lb/>Furthermore, physical inactivity is also the primary cause <lb/>of most chronic pathologies [16]. Therefore, it is of interest <lb/>to analyze the evolution of the control parameters of these <lb/>pathologies (especially those related to cardiovascular risk) <lb/>usually monitored by primary care medical staff, from <lb/>baseline through the follow-ups while performing physical <lb/>exercise regularly for any substantial amount of time. <lb/>Other interventions such as increasing vitamin D <lb/>levels, resolving an underlying anemia, or increasing <lb/>protein intake have shown improvement in the elderly&apos;s <lb/>physical function, independently from regular exercise&apos;s <lb/>benefit, and should be implemented within the context <lb/>of usual clinical practice [17]. <lb/>In Spain, primary care, is not only the point of entry <lb/>into the health system but it also provides accessibility <lb/>to diverse strata of the population with low disease bur-<lb/>den. Further, it offers continuity of care along with a <lb/>comprehensive approach including disease prevention <lb/>and health promotion [18]. Thus, primary care is ideally <lb/>positioned to play a crucial role in this intervention pro-<lb/>gram, through the maintenance and improvement of <lb/>physical, cognitive, and social functioning among the <lb/>elderly, as well as the promotion of individual self-care <lb/>for as long as possible. <lb/>In addition, primary care is also the default for <lb/>pre-frail individuals (close to 50% of all elderly) to re-<lb/>ceive care. Therefore, it is the ideal place for &quot;exercise <lb/>prescription,&quot; for teaching the necessary skills, and, last <lb/>but not least, for promoting self-care, participation, and <lb/>individual empowerment [19]. Consequently, it is pri-<lb/>mary care&apos;s responsibility to implement this type of pro-<lb/>gram, upon documented evidence of its effectiveness in <lb/>the context of clinical practice. Unfortunately, this evi-<lb/>dence is scarce in Mediterranean countries [13, 20], es-<lb/>pecially with pre-fragile individuals [21, 22]. <lb/>Long-term multifactorial interventions have been <lb/>shown to be more cost-effective than regular clinical <lb/>practice [9]. However, implementating these programs in <lb/>clinical practice usually encounters significant barriers <lb/>thus limiting their effectiveness. These barriers include, <lb/>among others, inadequate planning and coordination <lb/>among professionals, insufficient support at the service <lb/>provider level, inadequate dedication of the personnel <lb/>involved, and not active enough attitudes on the part of <lb/>key participants [23, 24]. <lb/>Adherence to exercise among previously sedentary <lb/>frail or pre-frail elderly fails to reach even 50% [22], al-<lb/>though it is somewhat higher for aerobic exercises such <lb/>as walking or cycling versus strength exercises, and is <lb/>also higher for group exercises versus proposed home <lb/>exercises [25]. An exercise intervention pilot study in <lb/></body>

			<body>frail 65 year-olds and older performed by our team in <lb/>the Primary Care Health Center Doctor Castroviejo (un-<lb/>published data), yielded a 28.3% adherence rate when <lb/>defining adherence as participation in at least 70% of the <lb/>sessions. Among the barriers limiting the recruitment <lb/>and adherence to exercise programs, the more common <lb/>included already getting enough exercise, not being mo-<lb/>tivated or ready and having poor health [26]. <lb/>Currently in Spain, significant lines of research on ex-<lb/>ercise and healthy ageing are underway, although not of <lb/>them has involved primary care [27, 28]. In fact and as <lb/>far as we know, there have been few interventions per-<lb/>formed exclusively with pre-frail individuals [21, 22], <lb/>thus, such studies are needed to provide evidence <lb/>generalizable to this population [9]. <lb/>Based on this evidence, this project aims to create a <lb/>multicomponent physical exercise program for pre-frail <lb/>individuals. In contrast to previous ones, our project <lb/>would be nestled within the structure and practice of <lb/>primary care. We would examine its effectiveness as well <lb/>as all and every aspect related to the implementation of <lb/>such a program in the context of primary care. <lb/>Aims <lb/>Main goal of the MEFAP-project is to evaluate the effect <lb/>of a multicomponent physical activity program in the pri-<lb/>mary care setting, versus regular medical practice, in re-<lb/>versing pre-frailty status [4] 12 months post-intervention <lb/>among patients over 70 years of age. <lb/>Secondary Objectives of the study are: <lb/>-To evaluate the effect of MEFAP versus regular med-<lb/>ical practice at 0-and 6-months post-intervention re-<lb/>garding: pre-frailty status according to the Fried scale, <lb/>quality of life, and clinical parameters such as blood <lb/>pressure, body mass index (BMI), cognitive status, mood <lb/>and chronic pain, and biological parameters such as <lb/>metabolic and inflammatory markers. <lb/>-Assess adherence to MEFAP and participant <lb/>satisfaction. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Design and setting <lb/>Pragmatic multicenter randomized clinical trial with par-<lb/>allel groups followed for 12 months. The setting is the <lb/>primary health care of the Spanish national health sys-<lb/>tem. Figure 1 shows the study design which was in-<lb/>formed by SPIRIT guidelines, which will also guide the <lb/>study reporting (Table 1). <lb/>Study participants <lb/>The study population is composed of non-dependent, <lb/>pre-frail elderly patients over the age of 70 and attending <lb/>the participating health centers. <lb/>Inclusion criteria <lb/>Following the 2014 Consensus Document on the pre-<lb/>vention of frailty and falls in the elderly patient [29] we <lb/>will recruit individuals &gt; 70 years of age, with a Barthel <lb/>test score ≥ 90 and meeting at least one of the following <lb/>two criteria: a score between 9 and 11 in the short phys-<lb/>ical performance battery (SPPB) [30] or FRAIL question-<lb/>naire with values 1 or 2 [31, 32]. At baseline (t1), <lb/>pre-frail patients will be included (1 or 2 frailty criteria <lb/>according to Fried: unintentional weight loss, exhaus-<lb/>tion, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity) [4]. <lb/>Exclusion criteria <lb/>1. Inability to go to the Primary Care Health Center <lb/>for any reason. <lb/>2. Moderate to severe cognitive impairment (MEC 30 <lb/>Lobo ≤21) [33]. <lb/>3. Severe pathology for which physical activity is <lb/>contraindicated at the physician&apos;s discretion <lb/>including but not limited to: recent acute <lb/>myocardial infarction (6 months), uncontrolled <lb/>cardiac arrhythmia, severe cardiac valve disease, <lb/>non-controlled hypertension (&gt; 180/100), non-<lb/>controlled/severe heart failure, severe respiratory <lb/>insufficiency disease, and diabetes mellitus with <lb/>acute decompensation/frequent hypoglycemia. <lb/>Sample size <lb/>We calculated the sample size based on two data points: <lb/>the published figure of 15% of pre-frail individuals that tran-<lb/>sition to robust status in the absence of an intervention [12] <lb/>and our 35% estimated percentage of pre-frail elderly in the <lb/>intervention group becoming robust again. Therefore, we <lb/>expect a difference of 20% of favorable evolution (from <lb/>pre-frail to robust) between both control and intervention <lb/>groups. Considering a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, <lb/>the sample size would be 146 patients (73 patients in the <lb/>intervention group and 73 patients in the control group). <lb/>Assuming an attrition of 30%, the final number needed to <lb/>recruit is 190 patients (n = 95 in IG and n = 95 in CG). <lb/>Recruitment <lb/>Primary Care Health Centers <lb/>All 32 Primary Care Health Centers (HC) in the Northern <lb/>Primary Care Health Directorate of the Community of <lb/>Madrid referring patients to the 7 physiotherapy units <lb/>available in this catchment area will be offered to partici-<lb/>pate in the study. The principal investigator will contact <lb/>and recruit each center personally. <lb/>Patients <lb/>Participating HC&apos;s doctors and nurses will recruit patients <lb/>&gt; 70 years of age consecutively until reaching their HC&apos;s <lb/></body>

This is a 12 session-intervention to take place on <lb/>a weekly basis in the physical therapy units with each <lb/>session lasting for an hour and a half. To reduce inter-<lb/>professional variability in the intervention, the partici-<lb/>pating physiotherapists will be trained to standardized <lb/>the delivery of the intervention. Control group (CG): <lb/>Participants assigned to this group will receive the usual <lb/>clinical practice. <lb/>All participants will receive a document with simple <lb/>physical activity recommendations as well as their report <lb/>with the results from all the clinical and analytical tests <lb/>after the baseline interview. Attrition will be minimized <lb/>by contacting participants by telephone after missing <lb/>just one intervention session. <lb/>Data collection <lb/>Data will be collected using an electronic data collection <lb/>notebook (eDCN) designed for the study. There are four <lb/>visits planned: enrolment (-t1) baseline (t1), at 6 months <lb/>(t2) and at 12 months (t3) of the end of the intervention. <lb/>The flowchart according to SPIRIT guidelines can be <lb/>seen in Table 1. <lb/>Analysis strategy <lb/>Analyses will compare the intervention group (IG) and the <lb/>control group (CG) and corresponding changes in frailty <lb/>status, physical performance, cognitive level, mood, and <lb/>chronic pain between baseline, and three post-intervention <lb/>points (0, 6, and 12-month post-intervention). Base-<lb/>line characteristics will be described according to <lb/>qualitative or quantitative variables: description and <lb/>analysis of the distribution of each variable, normality <lb/>tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and scatter charts. Par-<lb/>ticipant attrition will be described in detail. A base-<lb/>line comparison will be made between the groups: in <lb/>terms of descriptive, outcome, and prognostic vari-<lb/>ables. The appropriate bivariate statistical tests will be <lb/>used according to type of variable (qualitative or <lb/>quantitative). <lb/>Main analysis of effectiveness <lb/>Data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat analyses. <lb/>A positive event for the main outcome variable, inter-<lb/>vention effectiveness, will be defined as the transition from <lb/>pre-frailty (1 or 2 Fried criteria) to robust status (zero <lb/>Fried criteria) during the study period. The accumulated <lb/>incidence in each group, the relative risk (RR), the <lb/>number-needed-to-treat (NNT) will be calculated, with <lb/>their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We will per-<lb/>form the analysis with the statistical programs SPSS v.24. <lb/>Outcome evaluation (changes in frailty) and statistical <lb/>analyses will be conducted by skilled study staff blind to <lb/>treatment allocation. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The main goal of health services, and primary care spe-<lb/>cifically, is the prevention of morbidity and mortality. To <lb/>this end, the proposal of the Consensus on the preven-<lb/>tion of frailty and falls [29] aims to introduce exercise <lb/>into the regular routine of the elderly population to pre-<lb/>vent and reduce functional decline. Within this frame-<lb/>work, the study&apos;s desirable outcome is to encourage the <lb/>implementation of an exercise intervention tested in the <lb/>community sphere so physical activity becomes a regular <lb/>habit in the older adult population. A key characteristic <lb/>of the study is its pragmatic design of primary care im-<lb/>plementation, which not only allows to evaluate the pro-<lb/>gram&apos;s effectiveness but also its feasibility in conditions <lb/>and settings similar to those where it would be imple-<lb/>mented in the future. Therefore, it is also crucial to <lb/>evaluate aspects such as accessibility to the intervention, <lb/>adherence to the program, user satisfaction, and increase <lb/>in quality of life. <lb/>The study presents the following limitations: First, <lb/>there could be confounding effects if those assigned to <lb/>the CG were to follow the intervention. In order to <lb/>minimize this possibility and avoid attrition in the CG, <lb/>these participants will be offered participation in a simi-<lb/>lar multicomponent exercise program at the end of the <lb/>study period. Second, we expect a lower participation <lb/>rate among individuals whose Primary Care Health Cen-<lb/>ter is further away or the corresponding physical therapy <lb/>center is not easily accessible by private or public trans-<lb/>port. This information will become an important data <lb/>point as social and health services must be highly access-<lb/>ible to the user. Thus, we propose to analyze the rela-<lb/>tionship between user accessibility (in time, distance and <lb/>comfort) and adherence to program. <lb/>Third, participants will not be blind to group assign-<lb/>ment due to the trial&apos;s design. However, outcome evalu-<lb/>ation will be conducted by skilled interviewers that are <lb/>blinded for treatment allocation. The statistician con-<lb/>ducting the analysis will neither know to which study <lb/>group a given patient has been assigned. <lb/>One of the main strengths of the study is its pragmatic <lb/>design placing the program implemention within <lb/></body>

			<body>primary health care, that is, in similar conditions to <lb/>real-world implementation. This, in turn, may help the <lb/>prescription of exercise become a therapeutic tool within <lb/>the comprehensive care of the elderly patient. <lb/>Here we propose a multicomponent exercise interven-<lb/>tion implemented at the primary care level based on <lb/>healthcare professionals´solid commitment to pursue the <lb/>program participation and socialization of individuals. <lb/>Based on our knowledge of the characteristics of primary <lb/>care in the Community of Madrid, the program&apos;s successful <lb/>implementation is feasible and, furthermore, we expect <lb/>higher levels of adherence than those reported previously <lb/>[23]. Favorable results in this endeavor would encourage us <lb/>to support the implementation of periodic programs for <lb/>the improvement of the quality of life and physical and <lb/>mental function of the population served in primary care. <lb/></body>
