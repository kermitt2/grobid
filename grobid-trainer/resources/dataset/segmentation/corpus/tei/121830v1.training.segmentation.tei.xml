Recently, it has been shown that <lb/>high-throughput experimental measurements of mutational effects made via deep <lb/>mutational scanning can inform site-specific phylogenetic substitution models of <lb/>gene evolution. However, there is currently no software tailored for such analyses. <lb/>Results: We describe software that efficiently performs phylogenetic analyses <lb/>with substitution models informed by deep mutational scanning. This software, <lb/>phydms, is ∼100-fold faster than existing programs that accommodate such <lb/>substitution models. It can be used to compare the results of deep mutational <lb/>scanning experiments to the selection on genes in nature. For instance, phydms <lb/>enables rigorous comparison of how well different experiments on the same gene <lb/>describe natural selection. It also enables the re-scaling of deep mutational <lb/>scanning data to account for differences in the stringency of selection in the lab <lb/>and nature. Finally, phydms can identify sites that are evolving differently in <lb/>nature than expected from experiments in the lab. <lb/>Conclusions: The phydms software makes it easy to use phylogenetic <lb/>substitution models informed by deep mutational scanning experiments. As data <lb/>from such experiments becomes increasingly widespread, phydms will facilitate <lb/>quantitative comparison of the experimental results to the actual selection <lb/>pressures shaping evolution in nature. <lb/>Keywords: deep mutational scanning; ExpCM; amino-acid preferences; codon <lb/>substitution model; site-specific substitution model; positive selection; dN/dS <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>It is widely appreciated that experiments in the lab can inform understanding of pro-<lb/>tein evolution in nature [1, 2]. Efforts to synthesize findings from experiments with <lb/>evolutionary data have typically involved generating protein variants of interest, <lb/>assaying their functionality in the lab, and qualitatively comparing the measured <lb/>functionality of each variant to its evolutionary fate in nature [1, 2]. The recent <lb/>advent of high-throughput deep mutational scanning techniques [3] has greatly ex-<lb/>panded the potential of such research. For instance, numerous recent papers have <lb/>reported measuring the effects of all amino-acid mutations on the functionality of a <lb/>range of proteins [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This flood of <lb/>data necessitates new methods for comparing experimental measurements to evolu-<lb/>tion in nature, since simple qualitative inspection is insufficient when measurements <lb/>are available for tens of thousands of mutants. <lb/></body>

			<body>A solution is provided by the methods of molecular phylogenetics. Longstand-<lb/>ing phylogenetic algorithms enable calculation of the statistical likelihood of an <lb/>alignment of naturally occurring gene sequences given a phylogenetic tree and a <lb/>model for the evolutionary substitution process [20, 21]. Deep mutational scan-<lb/>ning data can be incorporated into this statistical framework via the substitution <lb/>model [9]. Such experimentally informed codon models (ExpCM) of substitution <lb/>can be used to test whether a deep mutational scanning experiment provides evo-<lb/>lutionarily relevant information [9], compare the stringency of selection in nature <lb/>and the lab [22, 23], assess how well different experiments describe natural selection <lb/>on the same gene [12, 15], and identify sites that are evolving differently in nature <lb/>than expected from experiments in the lab [23]. <lb/>However, a hindrance to such analyses has been the lack of appropriate software. <lb/>Prior work using ExpCM has involved re-purposing an existing software package <lb/>(HyPhy [24] or Bio++ [25]) to optimize the phylogenetic likelihood. Because these ex-<lb/>isting software packages are not designed for such site-specific models, the resulting <lb/>analyses have been slow and cumbersome. Other software packages [26, 27, 28, 29] <lb/>that handle site-specific codon substitution models are also not suitable, as they are <lb/>designed to treat the effects of mutations as unknowns to be inferred rather than <lb/>as values that have been measured a priori. <lb/>Here we describe phydms, software for phylogenetics informed by deep mutational <lb/>scanning. We show that phydms is ∼100-fold faster than existing alternatives for <lb/>performing analyses with ExpCM, and demonstrate how it can be used to quan-<lb/>titatively compare measurements from deep mutational scanning with selection on <lb/>genes in nature. Readers who are interested in technical details of how phydms <lb/>works should read the Implementation section; readers who are primarily interested <lb/>in simply using phydms may prefer to jump directly to the Results and Discussion <lb/>section. <lb/>Implementation <lb/>Substitution models <lb/>Here we briefly describe the codon substitution models implemented in phydms. <lb/>Experimentally informed codon models (ExpCM) <lb/>The basic ExpCM implemented in phydms are identical to those described in [23]. <lb/>We recap these ExpCM to introduce nomenclature needed to understand the ex-<lb/>tensions described in the next few subsections. <lb/>In an ExpCM, rate of substitution P r,xy of site r from codon x to y is written in <lb/>mutation-selection form [30, 31, 32] as <lb/>P r,xy = Q xy × F r,xy <lb/>(1) <lb/>where Q xy is proportional to the rate of mutation from x to y, and F r,xy is pro-<lb/>portional to the probability that this mutation fixes. The rate of mutation Q xy is <lb/></body>

			<body>assumed to be uniform across sites, and takes an HKY85-like [33] form: <lb/>Q xy = <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>   <lb/>φ w <lb/>if x and y differ by a transversion to nucleotide w <lb/>κφ w if x and y differ by a transition to nucleotide w <lb/>0 <lb/>if x and y differ by &gt; 1 nucleotide. <lb/>(2) <lb/>The κ parameter represents the transition-transversion ratio, and the φ w values give <lb/>the expected frequency of nucleotide w in the absence of selection on amino-acid <lb/>substitutions, and are constrained by 1 = w φ w . <lb/>The deep mutational scanning data are incorporated into the ExpCM via the F r,xy <lb/>terms. The experiments measure the preference π r,a of every site r for every amino-<lb/>acid a (see the Results and Discussion section for more details on these preferences). <lb/>The F r,xy terms are defined in terms of these experimentally measured amino-acid <lb/>preferences as <lb/>F r,xy = <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/>1 <lb/>if A (x) = A (y) <lb/>ω × <lb/>ln (πr,A(y)/πr,A(x)) <lb/>β <lb/>1−(π r,A(x) /π r,A(y)) <lb/>β <lb/>if A (x) = A (y) <lb/>(3) <lb/>where A (x) is the amino-acid encoded by codon x, β is the stringency parameter, <lb/>and ω is the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions after ac-<lb/>counting for the amino-acid preferences. As shown in Figure 1, Equation 3 implies <lb/>that mutations to more preferred amino acids are favored, and mutations to less pre-<lb/>ferred amino acids are disfavored. The functional form in Equation 3 was derived by <lb/>Halpern and Bruno [30] and under certain (probably unrealistic) population-genetic <lb/>assumptions; under these assumptions, β is related to the effective population size. <lb/>When β &gt; 1, natural evolution favors the same mutations as the experiments but <lb/>with greater stringency. The ExpCM have six free parameters (three φ w values, κ, <lb/>β, and ω). The preferences π r,a are not free parameters since they are determined <lb/>by an experiment independent of the sequence alignment being analyzed. <lb/>ExpCM with empirical nucleotide frequency parameters <lb/>Phylogenetic substitution models commonly set the nucleotide frequency param-<lb/>eters (φ w in the case of an ExpCM) so that the model&apos;s stationary state equals <lb/>the empirical frequencies of the characters in the alignment. Setting the frequency <lb/>parameters in this way reduces the number of parameters that must be optimized <lb/>by maximum likelihood. Empirically setting the nucleotide frequency parameters <lb/>is easy for substitution models where the stationary state only depends on these <lb/>parameters. <lb/>However, the situation for an ExpCM is more complex. The φ w values give the <lb/>expected nucleotide frequencies in the absence of selection on amino acids, but in <lb/>an ExpCM there is site-specific selection on amino acids. Therefore, the stationary <lb/>state of an ExpCM also depends on other quantities: the stationary state frequency <lb/>p r,x of codon x at site r is [23] <lb/>p r,x = <lb/>π r,A(x) <lb/>β φ x0 φ x1 φ x2 <lb/>z π r,A(z) <lb/>β φ z0 φ z1 φ z2 <lb/>, <lb/>(4) <lb/></body>

			<body>where x k indicates the nucleotide at position k in codon x. As this equation makes <lb/>clear, the stationary state of an ExpCM depends on the preferences π r,a and strin-<lb/>gency parameter β as well as the nucleotide frequency parameters φ w . <lb/>So for an ExpCM, setting φ w empirically means choosing their values such that <lb/>the alignment frequency g w of nucleotide w is as expected given the stationary state <lb/>p r,x . This will be the case if the following equation holds for all w: <lb/>g w = <lb/>1 <lb/>L r x <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>N w (x) p r,x <lb/>(5) <lb/>where L is the length of the gene in codons, r ranges over all codon sites, x ranges <lb/>over all codon identities, and N w (x) is the number of occurrences of nucleotide w <lb/>in codon x. We could not analytically solve this system of equations for φ w in terms <lb/>of g w , so we instead used a non-linear equation solver to determine the values as <lb/>detailed in Additional file 1. Calculating φ w empirically in this fashion is the default <lb/>for phydms. If you instead want to fit the φ w values, use the --fitphi option. <lb/>ExpCM with gamma-distributed nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate parameter <lb/>A common extension to traditional non-site-specific codon substitution models is <lb/>to allow the dN/dS ratio ω to come from several discrete categories by making the <lb/>overall likelihood at each site a linear combination of the likelihood computed for <lb/>each category [34, 35]. Such models are not site-specific since sites are not assigned <lb/>to a category during likelihood optimization, but they do capture the idea that <lb/>there are different strengths of selection on nonsynonymous mutations across sites. <lb/>One variant of this approach draws ω from a discrete gamma distribution. This <lb/>variant is referred to as the M5 variant [35] in PAML [36]. We implemented a similar <lb/>approach for ExpCM, following [37] to draw the ω in Equation 3 from the means <lb/>of equally weighted gamma-distributed categories (by default there are four cate-<lb/>gories). This option can be used via the --gammaomega switch to phydms, and adds <lb/>one free parameter, since there are two parameters controlling the gamma distri-<lb/>bution (a shape and inverse-scale parameter) rather than a single ω. This option <lb/>increases the runtime by ∼5-fold. <lb/>Using a gamma-distributed ω typically leads to less of an improvement in fit for <lb/>ExpCM than for non-site-specific models, since much of the site-to-site variation in <lb/>the selection is already captured by the amino-acid preferences. However, it can still <lb/>lead to substantial improvements if a subset of sites are under diversifying selection <lb/>or if the preferences do not fully capture selection on nonsynonymous mutations. <lb/>Traditional YNGKP-style models <lb/>To enable comparison of ExpCM with non-site-specific substitution models, phydms <lb/>implements several of these more traditional models. These models are referred to as <lb/>YNGKP as they are variants of the Goldman-Yang style models described by Yang, <lb/>Nielsen, Goldman, and Krabbe-Pedersen [35]. The M0 and M5 YNGKP models are <lb/>implemented in phydms. The M0 variant optimizes a single dN/dS ratio (ω) and so <lb/>is comparable with the basic ExpCM, while the M5 variant draws ω from a gamma <lb/>distribution and so is comparable to ExpCM with the --gammaomega option.

			<body>equilibrium codon frequencies are calculated empirically after correcting for stop <lb/>codons as described in [38] (the so-called CF3X4 method). The M0 variant has 11 <lb/>parameters (9 empirical nucleotide frequencies plus ω and κ), while the M5 variant <lb/>has 12 parameters (there are two parameters for the gamma distribution over ω). <lb/>YNGKP models are less computationally expensive than ExpCM since they are <lb/>not site-specific. Therefore, YNGKP models are faster than ExpCM in phydms. <lb/>However, phydms is not optimized for maximal speed with YNGKP models, so if <lb/>you are only using those models then consider using PAML [36] or HyPhy [24]. <lb/>Gradient-based optimization of the likelihood <lb/>Given one of the substitution models described above and a fixed phylogenetic tree <lb/>topology, phydms numerically optimizes the model parameters and branch lengths <lb/>to their maximum likelihood values via the Felsenstein pruning algorithm [21]. Nu-<lb/>merical optimization generally requires fewer steps if the gradient of the objective <lb/>function with respect to free parameters is computed explicitly [39], although this <lb/>advantage can be offset by the cost of computing the gradient. We were unable to <lb/>find clear published comparisons of the efficiency of phylogenetic optimization with <lb/>and without an explicit gradient, although there is literature describing how the <lb/>gradient (and Hessian matrix of second derivatives) can be computed [40]. <lb/>We chose to use gradient-based optimization for phydms under the supposition <lb/>that it might be more efficient. The first derivatives with respect to branch lengths <lb/>and virtually all the model parameters can be computed analytically, propagated <lb/>through the matrix exponentials using the formula provided by [41] (see also [40, <lb/>42]), and evaluated along the tree by applying the chain rule to the Felsenstein <lb/>pruning algorithm. For the ExpCM empirical nucleotide frequencies φ w and the <lb/>gamma-distributed ω, we used the numerical finite-difference method to compute <lb/>small portions of the derivatives for which we could not derive analytic results. <lb/>Additional file 1 details how phydms computes the likelihood and its gradient. <lb/>For the optimization, we used the limited-memory BFGS optimizer with <lb/>bounds [43, 44, 45]. This optimizer uses the gradient, although this can be turned <lb/>off with the --nograd option to phydms (doing so is not recommended as the ac-<lb/>curacy of phydms without gradients has not been extensively tested). Rather than <lb/>optimizing model parameters and branch lengths simultaneously, phydms takes an <lb/>iterative approach. First the model parameters are simultaneously optimized along <lb/>with a single scaling parameter that multiplies all branch lengths. After this op-<lb/>timization has converged, all branch lengths are simultaneously optimized while <lb/>holding the model parameters constant. This process is repeated until further opti-<lb/>mization leads to negligible improvement in the likelihood. Note that simultaneous <lb/>optimization of all branch lengths appears to be the minority approach in phyloge-<lb/>netics software [46] and is stated to be less efficient than one-at-a-time optimization <lb/>in [47]; however, we found it to work effectively on the trees that we tested. The <lb/>rationale for iterating between model parameters and branch lengths is that op-<lb/>timization of the former tends to be more difficult and more costly in terms of <lb/>the gradient computation. If you simply want to scale branch lengths by a single <lb/>parameter rather than optimize them, you can use the --brlen scale option. In <lb/>other contexts, scaling but not individually optimizing branch lengths has been <lb/></body>

			<body>shown to reduce runtime with little effect on final model parameters if the initial <lb/>tree is reasonably accurate [47, 48]. <lb/>Design and implementation of phydms <lb/>The phydms software is written in Python. Most of the numerical computation is <lb/>performed with numpy and scipy, and a few parts of the code are written in com-<lb/>piled C extensions created via cython. The limited-memory BFGS optimizer used <lb/>by phydms is the one provided with scipy.optimize. The most computationally <lb/>costly part of the optimization performed by phydms is the matrix-matrix multipli-<lb/>cation performed when computing exponentials of the transition matrix, and the <lb/>second most costly part is the matrix-vector multiplication performed while imple-<lb/>menting the Felsenstein pruning algorithm. Both these steps are performed using <lb/>BLAS subroutines called via scipy. <lb/>In addition to the core phydms program, the software is distributed with auxillary <lb/>programs that make it easy to prepare alignments (phydms prepalignment) and <lb/>run multiple models for comparison (phydms comprehensive). Importantly, phydms <lb/>currently does not infer phylogenetic tree topologies, but rather optimizes branch <lb/>lengths and model parameters given a topology. The tree topology must therefore <lb/>be inferred using another program such as RAxML [49] with a simpler substitution <lb/>model. <lb/>Visualization of the results with logoplots <lb/>It is often instructive to visualize the amino-acid preferences that are used to in-<lb/>form ExpCM, as these preferences determine the unique properties of the models. <lb/>In addition, visualization can help understand how the stringency parameter β <lb/>optimized by phydms re-scales the preferences to increase concordance with natu-<lb/>ral selection. To aid such visualizations, phydms comes with an auxiliary program <lb/>(phydms logoplot) that renders the amino-acid preferences in the form of logoplots <lb/>via the weblogo libraries [50]. The Results and Discussion section below shows ex-<lb/>ample logoplots. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Testing phydms on two different genes <lb/>In the sections below, we use phydms to compare deep mutational scanning measure-<lb/>ments to natural sequence evolution for two genes: influenza hemagglutinin (HA) <lb/>and β-lactamase. We choose these genes because there are multiple published deep <lb/>mutational scanning datasets for each. <lb/>Analysis with ExpCM requires three pieces of input data: the experimentally mea-<lb/>sured amino-acid preferences, an alignment of naturally occurring gene sequences, <lb/>and a phylogenetic tree topology. The tree topology can be inferred from the se-<lb/>quence alignment. But like most other software for codon-based phylogenetic anal-<lb/>yses [24, 36], phydms is not designed to infer the tree topology -instead, it provides <lb/>easy ways to infer this tree using other software such as RAxML [49]. <lb/>To prepare the required input data, we followed the workflow in Figure 2. The deep <lb/>mutational scanning experiments on HA [10, 15] directly reported amino-acid pref-<lb/>erences. However, the two β-lactamase deep mutational scanning experiments [6, 11] <lb/></body>

			<body>reported enrichment ratios for each mutation rather than amino-acid preferences. <lb/>There is a simple relationship between enrichment ratios and amino-acid prefer-<lb/>ences: the preferences are the enrichment ratios after normalizing the values to sum <lb/>to one at each site, enabling easy conversion between the two data representations <lb/>(Figure 2). <lb/>We also created codon-level alignments of naturally occurring HA and β-lactamase <lb/>sequences using phydms prepalignment. The alignments were trimmed to contain <lb/>only sites for which amino-acid preferences were experimentally measured. Table 1 <lb/>summarizes basic information about these alignments. <lb/>Test if deep mutational scanning is informative about natural selection <lb/>A first simple test is whether the deep mutational scanning experiment provides any <lb/>information that is relevant to natural selection on the gene in question. This can be <lb/>determined by testing whether an ExpCM that uses the experimental data outper-<lb/>forms a standard substitution model that is agnostic to the site-specific preferences <lb/>measured in the experiments. <lb/>To perform such a test, we used phydms comprehensive to fit several substitution <lb/>models to the alignment of HA sequences. This program automatically generates <lb/>a phylogenetic tree topology from the alignment using RAxML [49]. It then fits an <lb/>ExpCM (in this case informed by the deep mutational scanning data in Doud and <lb/>Bloom [15]) as well as several substitution models that do not utilize site-specific <lb/>experimental information. The analysis was performed by running the following <lb/>command on the input data in Additional file 2: <lb/>phydms_comprehensive results/ HA_alignment.fasta HA_Doud_prefs.csv --raxml raxml <lb/>Table 2 lists the four tested substitution models: the ExpCM, an ExpCM with <lb/>the amino-acid preferences averaged across sites, and the M0 and M5 variants of <lb/>the standard Goldman-Yang style substitution models [35]. The ExpCM with aver-<lb/>aged preferences is a sensible control because averaging the preferences eliminates <lb/>any experimental information specific to individual sites in the protein. Because <lb/>the models have different numbers of free parameters, they are best compared us-<lb/>ing Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [51], which compares log likelihoods after <lb/>correcting for the number of free parameters. Table 2 shows that the ExpCM has a <lb/>much smaller AIC than the other models (∆AIC &gt; 2000 for all of the other models). <lb/>This result shows that the experimentally measured amino-acid preferences contain <lb/>information about natural selection on HA, since a substitution model informed <lb/>by these preferences greatly outperforms generic substitution models that do not <lb/>utilize experimental information. <lb/>Re-scale deep mutational scanning data to stringency of natural selection <lb/>Even if a deep mutational scanning experiment measures the authentic natural <lb/>selection on a gene, the stringency of selection in the experiment is not expected to <lb/>match the stringency of selection in nature. Differences in the stringency of selection <lb/>can be captured by the ExpCM stringency parameter β. If selection in nature prefers <lb/>the same amino acids as the selection in lab but with greater stringency, β will be <lb/>fit to a value &gt; 1. Conversely, if selection in nature does not prefer the lab-favored <lb/>mutations with as much stringency as the deep mutational scan, β will be fit to a <lb/></body>

			<body>value &lt; 1. Table 2 shows that ExpCM for HA informed by the experiments in [15] <lb/>have β = 2.11, indicating that natural selection favors the experimentally preferred <lb/>amino acids with higher stringency than selection in the lab. <lb/>The effect of this stringency re-scaling of the preferences can be visualized using <lb/>phydms logoplot as shown in Figure 3. Re-scaling by the optimal stringency pa-<lb/>rameter of 2.11 exaggerates the selection for experimentally preferred amino acids. <lb/>Conversely, if the analysis had fit a stringency parameter &lt; 1, this would have flat-<lb/>tened the experimental measurements, and when β = 0 all information from the <lb/>experiments is lost (Figure 3). Because selection in the lab can probably never be <lb/>tuned to exactly match that in nature, stringency re-scaling is a valuable method <lb/>to standardize measurements across experiments. <lb/>Compare how well different experiments capture natural selection <lb/>The amino-acid preferences for both HA and β-lactamase have each been measured <lb/>by two independent experiments. For each gene, which of these experiments better <lb/>captures natural selection? <lb/>We can address this question by comparing ExpCM informed by each experiment. <lb/>For β-lactamase, this means comparing the preferences measured by Stiffler et al [11] <lb/>to those measured by Firnberg et al [6]. We did this with phydms comprehensive <lb/>by running the following command on the input data in Additional file 4: <lb/>phydms_comprehensive results/ betaLactamase_alignment.fasta <lb/>betaLactamase_Stiffler_prefs.txt betaLactamase_Firnberg_prefs.txt --raxml raxml <lb/>Table 3 shows that the ExpCM informed by the data of Stiffler et al [11] out-<lb/>perform ExpCM informed by the data of Firnberg et al [6], with a ∆AIC of 96.2. <lb/>Therefore, the former experiment better reflects natural selection on β-lactamase. <lb/>However, both experiments are clearly informative, as they both greatly outperform <lb/>the traditional YNGKP models. <lb/>We made a similar comparison of the two deep mutational scans of HA. As sum-<lb/>marized in Table 4 (and detailed in Additional file 5), the deep mutational scanning <lb/>of Doud and Bloom [15] better describes the natural evolution than the experiments <lb/>of Thyagarajan and Bloom [10] (∆AIC of 44.2). Again, both experiments are clearly <lb/>informative, as they both greatly outperform the YNGKP models. <lb/>Overall, these results show how phydms can rigorously compare how well different <lb/>experiments describe the evolution of a gene. <lb/>Identify sites of diversifying selection <lb/>In some cases, a few sites may evolve differently in nature than expected from the <lb/>experiments in the lab. For instance, sites under diversifying selection for amino-<lb/>acid change will experience more nonsynonymous substitutions than expected given <lb/>the experimentally measured amino-acid preferences. Such sites can be identified <lb/>by using the --omegabysite option to fit a parameter ω r that gives the relative <lb/>rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions after accounting for the ex-<lb/>perimentally measured preferences for each site r [23]. If the preferences capture <lb/>all the selection on amino acids, then we expect ω r = 1. Sites with ω r &gt; 1 are un-<lb/>der diversifying selection for amino-acid change, while sites with ω r &lt; 1 are under <lb/>additional purifying selection not measured in the lab. <lb/></body>

			<body>We tested for diversifying selection in HA by running the following command on <lb/>the data in Additional file 6: <lb/>phydms HA_alignment.fasta HA_RAxML_tree.newick ExpCM_HA_Doud_prefs.csv results/ <lb/>--omegabysite <lb/>The results are visualized in Figure 4. While the majority of sites are evolving <lb/>with ω r not significantly different from one, some sites show evidence of ω r &gt; 1. As <lb/>described in [23], these sites may be under diversifying selection due to immune pres-<lb/>sure. Overall, this analysis shows how phydms can identify individual sites evolving <lb/>differently in nature than expected from experiments in the lab. <lb/>phydms has vastly superior computational performance to existing alternatives <lb/>Our rationale for developing phydms was to enable the analyses described above to <lb/>be performed faster than with existing software. To validate the improved compu-<lb/>tational performance, we compared phydms (version 2.0.0) to alternative programs <lb/>that have been used to fit ExpCM. The comparisons used the HA sequences de-<lb/>scribed in Table 1 with ExpCM informed by the deep mutational scanning in [15], <lb/>and were performed on a single core of a 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon CPU. <lb/>Table 5 shows the results. With default settings, phydms took 10 minutes to op-<lb/>timize the model parameters and branch lengths. This runtime could be decreased <lb/>by scaling the branch lengths by a single parameter rather than optimizing them <lb/>individually (--brlen scale option); other work has shown that when the initial <lb/>tree is reasonably accurate, this approximation can improve runtime while only <lb/>slightly affecting model fit [47, 48]. Fitting the nucleotide frequency parameters φ w <lb/>(--fitphi option) rather than determining them empirically doubled the runtime. <lb/>The log likelihood and values of the model parameters β and ω were nearly identical <lb/>for all three of these settings of phydms. Interestingly, the gradient-based optimiza-<lb/>tion appears to be important: using phydms without gradients (--nograd option) <lb/>increased the runtime over 5-fold while also yielding a poorer log likelihood. <lb/>Two alternative programs have previously been used to fit ExpCM. Early work [22] <lb/>with these models used a Python program phyloExpCM (https://github.com/ <lb/>jbloom/phyloExpCM) to run HyPhy to optimize ExpCM similar to the ones used <lb/>here. Subsequent work [23] used an old version of phydms to fit ExpCM identical <lb/>to the ones here using the Bio++ libraries [25]. We ran both these programs on the <lb/>HA data set, using phyloExpCM version 0.3 with HyPhy version 2.22, and phydms <lb/>version 1.3.0 with Bio++. Table 5 shows that these programs were ∼100-fold and <lb/>∼200-fold slower than phydms version 2.0.0 with default settings. A small portion <lb/>of the slower runtime is because these earlier implementations cannot calculate <lb/>empirical nucleotide frequency φ w parameters; however they remain much slower <lb/>than phydms even when these parameters are fit. Divining the reasons for the per-<lb/>formance differences was not possible, as the programs differ completely in their <lb/>implementations. But reassuringly, all programs yielded similar model parameters <lb/>β and ω despite independent implementations of the likelihood calculations and the <lb/>optimization. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>We have described a new software package, phydms, that facilitates efficient phy-<lb/>logenetic analysis of gene sequences using substitution models informed by deep <lb/></body>

			<body>mutational scanning experiments. Using these ExpCM, phydms can quantitatively <lb/>compare deep mutational scanning measurements to selection on genes in nature. <lb/>It can re-scale deep mutational scanning data to account for differences in the strin-<lb/>gency of selection between the lab and nature, identify sites evolving differently in <lb/>nature than expected from the experiments, and compare how well different exper-<lb/>iments on the same gene describe natural selection. <lb/>The ability to perform these comparisons is useful because the rationale for many <lb/>deep mutational scanning experiments is to provide information about the effects of <lb/>mutations on genes in nature. For instance, there are many ways to design an exper-<lb/>iment, and it is often not obvious which choices are best if the goal is to make the <lb/>experiment reflect natural selection -using phydms, it is possible to quantitatively <lb/>compare how well different experiments describe natural selection. Likewise, it is <lb/>often useful to know which specific sites in a gene are evolving differently in nature <lb/>than expected from experiments in the lab [23]; phydms makes statistically rigorous <lb/>identification of these sites possible. The speed and ease of use of phydms makes <lb/>these analyses practical for real datasets. As deep mutational scanning data become <lb/>available for an increasing number of genes, phydms will facilitate comparison of the <lb/>experimental measurements to selection in nature. <lb/></body>

Analysis with phydms requires amino-acid <lb/>preferences measured by deep mutational scanning, a codon-level alignment of naturally occurring <lb/>sequences, and a phylogenetic tree topology. Deep mutational scanning involves performing a <lb/>functional selection on a library of mutant genes, and using deep sequencing to quantify the <lb/>enrichment or depletion of each mutation after selection. To process the deep mutational scanning <lb/>data referred to in Table 1, we converted enrichment ratios into amino-acid preferences by <lb/>normalizing the values to sum to one at each site. We created a filtered, codon-level alignment of <lb/>naturally occurring sequences using phydms prepalignment. We used phydms comprehensive to <lb/>automatically generate a tree topology from the filtered alignment using RAxML. <lb/></body>

When β = 1, <lb/>the preferences are same as the values measured in the lab, suggesting a similar stringency of <lb/>selection in the experiments and in nature. When β &gt; 1, selection in nature prefers the same <lb/>amino acids as selection in lab but with greater stringency -therefore, highly preferred amino <lb/>acids increase in preference while lowly preferred amino acids decrease. When β &lt; 1, selection in <lb/>nature has less preference than the experiments for mutations favored in the lab, and when β = 0 <lb/>then all site-specific information is lost. The actual optimized stringency parameter reported in <lb/>Table 2 is β = 2.11. We generated the logoplots shown above from the input data in Additional <lb/>file 3 with the following commands: <lb/>phydms_logoplot HA_Doud_1.pdf --prefs HA_Doud_prefs_short.csv <lb/>phydms_logoplot HA_Doud_2_11.pdf --prefs HA_Doud_prefs_short.csv --stringency <lb/>2.11 <lb/>phydms_logoplot HA_Doud_0.pdf --prefs HA_Doud_prefs_short.csv --stringency 0 <lb/></body>

The phydms option --omegabysite fits a site-specific <lb/>value for ωr, which gives the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions at site <lb/>r after accounting for the selection due to the amino-acid preferences. This figure shows the <lb/>results of such an analysis for HA. The overlay bar represents the strength of evidence for ωr <lb/>being greater (red) or less (blue) than one. Because this approach accounts for the constraints <lb/>due to the amino-acid preferences, it can identify sites evolving faster than expected even if their <lb/>absolute relative rates of nonysnonymous to synonymous substitutions do not significantly differ <lb/>from one [23]. The logoplot in this figure uses the stringency parameter value of β = 2.11, and <lb/>was generated by running the following command on the data in Additional file 3: <lb/>phydms_logoplot results/omegabysite.pdf --prefs HA_Doud_prefs.csv --omegabysite <lb/>results/omegabysite.txt --stringency 2.11 --minP 0.001 <lb/>In this figure, the HA sequence is numbered sequentially beginning with 1 for the first site with <lb/>deep mutational scanning data, which is the second residue in the protein. <lb/></body>
