			<body>Report <lb/>A 54-year-old woman visited our emergency department <lb/>because of repeated vomiting for one day. Physical exami-<lb/>nation and blood analysis revealed subtle tenderness of <lb/>the right upper abdomen and mild elevation of white <lb/>blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. She under-<lb/>went pre-and post-contrast abdomino-pelvic computed <lb/>tomography (CT). A small gallstone was detected, and <lb/>slight edema of the gallbladder was suspected. She was <lb/>admitted with the suspicion of mild cholecystitis. <lb/>On the morning after the admission, she reported <lb/>headache and collapsed. Brain CT revealed a large suba-<lb/>rachnoid hematoma with hydrocephalus (Figure 1). <lb/>Considering the distribution of the hematoma and the <lb/>existence of hydrocephalus, repeated aneurysm rupture <lb/>was suspected. The abdomino-pelvic CT data were re-<lb/>assessed, and increased density of the cerebrospinal fluid <lb/>(CSF) (more than that of the spinal cord) was noted in the <lb/>spinal canal (Figure 2). We suspected that the first rup-<lb/>ture occurred before the admission. Her family confirmed <lb/>that she experienced relatively severe headache three days <lb/>prior to admission. <lb/></body>

			<body>Comment <lb/>The symptoms of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage <lb/>(SAH) are usually sudden and include severe headache. If <lb/>brain CT is performed within 24 hours of onset, SAH can <lb/>be diagnosed in over 90% of cases. However, with time, <lb/>SAH becomes more difficult to detect on CT because of <lb/>CSF clearance [1]. When the initial rupture is not severe <lb/>and the headache is mild, the onset is usually overlooked, <lb/>and the patient visits the hospital for other vague symp-<lb/>toms or visits the emergency room only after a second rup-<lb/>ture. In this setting, if previous body CT data are available <lb/>that show SAH within the spinal canal, the findings may <lb/>help speculating the onset of aneurysm rupture. <lb/>Conversely, if SAH is incidentally found within the <lb/>spinal canal, the most frequent cause is traumatic medical <lb/>procedures, such as lumbar puncture and surgery, and it is <lb/>followed by intracranial SAH. In patients without a history <lb/>of recent lumbar puncture or surgery, SAH in the spinal <lb/>canal may be the first finding of intracranial SAH. <lb/></body>
