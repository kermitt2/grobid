To comply, California passed the Public <lb/>Safety Realignment Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 109), representing the largest ever court-ordered <lb/>reduction of a prison population in U.S. history. AB109 was successful in reducing the state <lb/>prison population; however, although the policy was precipitated by inadequate healthcare in <lb/>state prisons, no studies have examined its effects on prisoner health. As other states grap-<lb/>ple with overcrowded prisons and look to California&apos;s experience with this landmark policy, <lb/>understanding how it may have impacted prisoner health is critical. We sought to evaluate <lb/>the effects of AB109 on prison mortality and assess the extent to which policy-induced <lb/>changes in the age distribution of prisoners may have contributed to these effects. To do so, <lb/>we used prison mortality data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the California Deaths <lb/>in Custody reporting program and prison population data from the National Corrections <lb/>Reporting Program to examine changes in overall prison mortality, the age distribution of pris-<lb/>oners, and age-adjusted prison mortality in California relative to other states before and after <lb/>the implementation of AB109. Following AB109, California prisons experienced an increase <lb/>in overall mortality relative to other states that attenuated within three years. Over the same <lb/>period, California experienced a greater upward shift in the age distribution of its prisoners <lb/>relative to other states, suggesting that the state&apos;s increase in overall mortality may have <lb/>been driven by this change in age distribution. Indeed, when accounting for this differential <lb/>change in age distribution, mortality among California prisoners exhibited a greater reduction <lb/>relative to other states in the third year after implementation. As other states seek to reduce <lb/>their prison populations to address overcrowding, assessments of California&apos;s experience <lb/>with AB109 should consider this potential improvement in age-adjusted mortality. <lb/></front>

			<body>criminal justice and recent legislation has successfully decreased incarceration rates [2, 3], a <lb/>substantial population remains incarcerated in prisons and jails in the US. <lb/>California has the nation&apos;s second largest prison population. Following substantial popula-<lb/>tion growth in the 1980&apos;s and 1990&apos;s, California&apos;s prisons were characterized by extreme over-<lb/>crowding during the 2000&apos;s. Although California&apos;s prisons were not unique in this regard, the <lb/>circumstances surrounding its efforts to resolve the problem of overcrowding were. Two class <lb/>action lawsuits filed on behalf California state prisoners alleged that inadequate mental (Cole-<lb/>man v. Brown, filed 1990) and physical (Brown v. Plata, filed 2001) healthcare stemming from <lb/>overcrowded conditions violated prisoners&apos; constitutional rights. In connection with Brown v. <lb/>Plata, federal courts established a receivership with full authority over the state&apos;s prison health-<lb/>care system in 2006. Components of both lawsuits were ultimately consolidated before a single <lb/>three-judge court, which in 2009 declared overcrowding to be the primary reason for health-<lb/>care deficiencies and mandated the state to reduce its prison population by nearly 50,000 indi-<lb/>viduals, corresponding to approximately a 30% reduction. This order was upheld by the U.S. <lb/>Supreme Court in 2011 and California was required to meet the mandated reduction target <lb/>within three years of the ruling [4]. To comply with the court&apos;s decision, California passed the <lb/>Public Safety Realignment Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 109) in October 2011. <lb/>AB109 sought to decrease the prison population by prospectively shifting the custodial <lb/>responsibility of non-violent, non-serious, and non-sexual offenders from state prisons to <lb/>county jails and probation departments, which was motivated by the idea that local agencies <lb/>could do a better job of rehabilitating offenders [5, 6]. In addition, by limiting the funds pro-<lb/>vided to counties for these additional inmates, the policy incentivized more cost-effective alter-<lb/>natives to incarceration, such as the use of day reporting centers, shorter post-release <lb/>community supervision, intensive probation, and home detention with GPS monitoring, with <lb/>the aim of lowering the overall rate of incarceration across both prisons and jails [5, 6]. <lb/>Empirical studies and policy analyses have examined the effects of AB109 on a variety of <lb/>outcomes, including state prison and county jail populations [7-10], recidivism [7, 11-16], <lb/>corrections spending [7], and crime [7, 8, 17-19]. Research suggests that AB109 significantly <lb/>reduced the state prison population and extent of overcrowding, though not enough to reach <lb/>the court-mandated target, while increasing the county jail population [7-9, 11]. The increase <lb/>in the county jail population was smaller than the decrease in the state prison population, <lb/>resulting in a lower rate of incarceration overall. However, one study found that AB109 may <lb/>have exacerbated racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in incarceration in California&apos;s prison <lb/>system [10]. AB109 appears to have led to modest increases in recidivism statewide, but <lb/>increases were smaller for counties that prioritized reentry programs [7, 11-15]. As of 2015, <lb/>the policy appears to have had no effect on rates of violent crime, but may have increased rates <lb/>of property crime, particularly auto theft [7, 8, 17-19]. <lb/>Despite the fact that AB109 was precipitated by inadequate healthcare in California prisons, <lb/>no independent studies have examined its effect on the health of prisoners. However, monthly <lb/>reports tracking a wide variety of healthcare performance indicators did document improve-<lb/>ments following the implementation of AB109 [20, 21]. Indeed, in 2013, Governor Jerry <lb/>Brown of California declared that prison overcrowding no longer inhibited the delivery of <lb/>timely and effective healthcare to prisoners. <lb/>AB109 was implemented amidst an evolving prison healthcare system in California, includ-<lb/>ing documented improvements under the federal receivership and the opening of a new medi-<lb/>cal complex that was constructed in 2013 in response to decisions in both the Plata and <lb/>Coleman cases [20]. As such, it is not possible to isolate the effects of AB109 from those due to <lb/>other concurrent changes prompted by these lawsuits. However, given that overcrowding was <lb/>identified as the primary reason for California&apos;s inadequate prison healthcare [4], it is plausible <lb/></body>

			<body>that any changes in health outcomes over this period are at least partially attributable to the <lb/>de-crowding effects of AB109. Furthermore, the changes initiated by AB109 were unprece-<lb/>dented in state-level criminal justice reform, representing the largest ever court-ordered reduc-<lb/>tion of a prison population in the U.S. Indeed, AB109 has been characterized as &quot;the biggest <lb/>criminal justice experiment ever conducted in America&quot; [22]. At the end of 2020, 10 states <lb/>exceeded at least one measure of prisoner capacity [23]. As these states continue to grapple <lb/>with overcrowded prisons and look to California&apos;s experience with AB109, it is critical that we <lb/>understand how the policy may have impacted all relevant outcomes, including prisoner <lb/>health. <lb/>Leveraging several complementary data sources, we aimed to evaluate the effects of AB109 <lb/>on California state prisoner mortality. By shifting the responsibility of low-level offenders to <lb/>county jails, AB109 impacted both the number of composition of prisoners in California state <lb/>prisons. Because of these dynamics, we also sought to assess the extent to which effects of <lb/>AB109 on prisoner mortality might be attributable contemporaneous changes in the age distri-<lb/>bution of prisoners. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Overview <lb/>To evaluate the effects of AB109 on California state prisoner mortality and assess the extent to <lb/>which changes in the age distribution may have contributed to these effects, we conducted <lb/>four complementary analyses. First, we evaluated the effects of AB109 on crude mortality (i.e., <lb/>not accounting for temporal changes in age distribution) using the synthetic control method. <lb/>Second, we examined how the age distribution of California state prisoners changed following <lb/>AB109 and compared these changes to those occurring in other states over the same time-<lb/>frame. Third, we compared trends in crude and age-standardized mortality among California <lb/>state prisoners before and after AB109. Lastly, we compared pre-to post-AB109 changes in <lb/>mortality among California state prisoners to those occurring in other states while accounting <lb/>for differential changes in prisoner age distributions between states. This study was approved <lb/>by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley <lb/>(Protocol Number 2018-09-11405) and granted a waiver of informed consent because it only <lb/>involved coded administrative data with no personal identifiers. <lb/>Data sources <lb/>To comprehensively answer our research question, we would ideally leverage data on the uni-<lb/>verse of state prisoners in the US, including their ages and dates of incarceration, as well as if <lb/>and when they died in prison. However, such comprehensive data were not obtainable. <lb/>Instead, we leveraged three complementary data sources that were either publicly available or <lb/>practically obtainable in order to conduct the four analyses outlined above. <lb/>First, we obtained the annual counts of deaths and crude mortality rates among state pris-<lb/>oners for all 50 states for years 2001-2015 from publicly available reports published by the <lb/>Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) [24, 25]. <lb/>Next, we obtained individual-level state prison inmate term records for California and sev-<lb/>eral other states for years 2000-2015, including month and year of birth and prison term dates, <lb/>from the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) [26]. Annually, the NCRP collects <lb/>offender-level administrative data on prison admissions and releases and yearend custody <lb/>populations from participating jurisdictions. The number of states submitting data to NCRP <lb/>has varied over time, with at least 38 states providing some amount of data since 2000. These <lb/></body>

			<body>data were available from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research <lb/>under restricted conditions. <lb/>Lastly, we obtained de-identified individual-level data for all deaths among California state <lb/>prisoners, including age of the decedent and date of death, from the California Deaths in Cus-<lb/>tody (DIC) reporting program [27]. The DIC Data includes all deaths that occur in law <lb/>enforcement custody. To capture deaths among California state prisoners, we retained only <lb/>deaths for which the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had custody of <lb/>the subject immediately preceding death. We excluded decedents held in out-of-state correc-<lb/>tional facilities, those who died by execution, and those released on medical parole. These data <lb/>were publicly available through California Department of Justice&apos;s Open Justice program [28]. <lb/>Collectively, these data sources provide us with or allow us to calculate crude annual mor-<lb/>tality rates for California and comparison states (BJS Data), annual total mortality counts for <lb/>California and comparison states (BJS Data), annual age-specific prisoner person-time for Cal-<lb/>ifornia and comparison states (NCRP Data), and annual age-specific mortality counts for Cali-<lb/>fornia only (DIC Data). Supplemental Table 1 in S1 Appendix provides an overview as to <lb/>which components of these data sources were used in each of our four analyses. <lb/>Crude mortality <lb/>To evaluate the effect of AB109 on crude mortality, we used the synthetic control method with <lb/>the annual crude mortality rates from the BJS as the outcome variable [29, 30]. Specifically, we <lb/>considered California as the single treated unit, and included other states in the donor pool <lb/>from which to construct the synthetic control. The synthetic control approach uses pre-policy <lb/>covariates and outcome data to identify a weighted combination of control units whose <lb/>weighted pre-policy covariates and outcomes best fit those of the treated unit. For our analysis, <lb/>the pre-policy period included years 2001-2010 and the post-policy period included years <lb/>2012-2014. The year 2011 was excluded because AB109 was implemented in October 2011. <lb/>Years after 2014 were excluded because California implemented Proposition 47, another <lb/>major criminal justice law that reduced penalties for many low-level crimes, in November <lb/>2014. The effect of AB109 on prisoner mortality is estimated by comparing the observed Cali-<lb/>fornia state prisoner mortality rate to that of the synthetic control unit in the post-policy <lb/>period. Full methodological details of this analysis are provided in S1 Appendix. <lb/>Changes in prisoner age distributions <lb/>In order to investigate the extent to which the effects of AB109 on crude mortality may be <lb/>attributable to changes in California&apos;s prisoner age distribution, we first sought to assess how <lb/>the age distribution of California state prisoners changed following AB109 relative to other <lb/>states over the same timeframe. If California experienced a change in age-distribution follow-<lb/>ing AB109 that was extreme relative to concurrent changes in other states, this would support <lb/>the plausibility that effects of AB109 on mortality could be attributable to a shift in the Califor-<lb/>nia&apos;s prisoner age-distribution. To do this, we calculated the proportion of prisoner person-<lb/>time corresponding to specific age groups (under 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, over <lb/>74) for 2010 and each year 2012-2014 for California and each comparison state. Prisoner per-<lb/>son-time was derived from the NCRP individual-level term records. Here, prisoner person-<lb/>time for a given year refers to the total number of days incarcerated among all individuals <lb/>incarcerated in that year; for example, if two prisoners were incarcerated in 2010, one for the <lb/>entire year (i.e. 365 days) and one for only 30 days, these two prisoners would represent 365 <lb/>+ 30 = 395 days of prisoner person-time in 2010. For each state and year, calculating the pro-<lb/>portion of prisoner person-time corresponding to specific age groups involved summing up <lb/></body>

			<body>the incarcerated person-time among prisoners falling within each age group and dividing by <lb/>the total incarcerated person-time to obtain proportions. We then calculated the relative <lb/>change in each age group proportion from 2010 to each of the three post-policy years for each <lb/>state. <lb/>Comparing crude and age-standardized mortality among California state <lb/>prisoners <lb/>Next, we sought to investigate differences between the trend in crude California state prisoner <lb/>mortality and the trend in California state prisoner mortality that accounts for changes in the <lb/>age-distribution of prisoners over time and, particularly, following AB109. To do so, we com-<lb/>pared the annual crude mortality rates among California state prisoners from 2008-2014 to <lb/>annual age-standardized mortality rates over the same period, both calculated with death <lb/>counts from the DIC data and person-time measures from the individual-level NCRP data. To <lb/>calculate the annual age-standardize mortality rates, California&apos;s annual age-specific mortality <lb/>rates for each year from 2008-2014 were applied to the California state prisoner age-distribu-<lb/>tion from 2008, which preceded the implementation of AB109. This procedure is known as <lb/>direct standardization. The age-standardized mortality rates for each year were thus calculated <lb/>as: <lb/>l AS <lb/>CA;j Â¼ <lb/>X K <lb/>kÂ¼1 l CA;j;k pt CA;2008;k <lb/>X K <lb/>kÂ¼1 pt CA;2008;k <lb/>for years j Â¼ 2008; 2009; . . . ; 2014 <lb/>Where Î» AS <lb/>CA,j is the California age-standardized rate for year j; Î» CA,j,k is the California mortal-<lb/>ity rate for year j and age group k; and pt CA,2008,k is the California incarcerated person-time for <lb/>2008 and age group k. The age-standardized mortality trend illustrates how crude mortality <lb/>would have changed if the California state prisoner age-distribution were static from 2008 to <lb/>2014. We were only able to standardize California&apos;s age-specific prisoner mortality rates in this <lb/>way because we had access to annual age-specific mortality rates for California but not for any <lb/>comparison states. <lb/>Comparing age-standardized mortality between California and other states <lb/>Lastly, we sought to evaluate the effects of AB109 on mortality net of any effect due to resultant <lb/>changes in the age distribution of California state prisoners and any secular trends approxi-<lb/>mated by the experience of other states. To do so, we compared California&apos;s change in state <lb/>prisoner mortality from pre-to post-policy years to that experienced by other states, while con-<lb/>trolling for differential changes in age distribution between California and other states over the <lb/>same period. Standard approaches to adjust for differential changes in age distribution <lb/>between California and other states would require that annual age specific mortality rates <lb/>among California and other states be compared directly or standardized to and summed over <lb/>the same age distribution, such as California&apos;s age distribution in a given year (i.e., direct stan-<lb/>dardization). However, as previously noted, the data available for this analysis precluded the <lb/>ability to calculate age-specific rates for any state but California and thus we could not evaluate <lb/>trends in age-adjusted mortality across states using the synthetic control method. We did, <lb/>however, have access to the annual age-specific person-time from the NCRP data and the total <lb/>number of deaths from the BJS data for comparison states. <lb/>To compare mortality trends between California and other states while accounting for dif-<lb/>ferential changes in age distribution, this combination of data is amenable to an extension of <lb/>the method of indirect age standardization, in which a set of &quot;standard&quot; age-specific mortality <lb/></body>

			<body>rates are standardized to and summed over a target age distribution to obtain the total number <lb/>or rate of deaths expected in the target population had it experienced the &quot;standard&quot; age-spe-<lb/>cific mortality rates. We calculated a single measure for each control state and post-policy year <lb/>that captured the excess (or deficit) change in mortality that would have occurred in the con-<lb/>trol state had it experienced California&apos;s age-group specific mortality rates in the pre-and rele-<lb/>vant post-policy year. Specifically, we used California&apos;s annual age-specific mortality rates as <lb/>the &quot;standard&quot; set of rates, which we standardized to and summed over the age distribution of <lb/>each control state for each corresponding year. Thus, for each control state, we obtained four <lb/>quantities that corresponded to the marginal mortality rate expected in each control state had <lb/>it experienced California&apos;s age-group specific mortality rates in 2010 and each year 2012-2014. <lb/>Then, for each control state and post-policy year, we calculated the difference between the <lb/>change in the expected marginal mortality rate from 2010 to a post-policy year and the change <lb/>in the control state&apos;s observed marginal mortality rate over the same period. Thus, the age-<lb/>adjusted excess mortality was calculated as: <lb/>EM i;j Â¼ <lb/>X K <lb/>kÂ¼1 l CA;j;k pt i;j;k <lb/>X K <lb/>kÂ¼1 pt i;j;k <lb/>Ã <lb/>X K <lb/>kÂ¼1 l CA;2010;k pt i;2010;k <lb/>X K <lb/>iÂ¼1 pt i;2010;k <lb/>0 <lb/>@<lb/>1 <lb/>A Ã CR i;j Ã CR i;2010 <lb/>ï¿½ <lb/>ï¿½ <lb/>for comparison states i Â¼ 1; . . . ; n and years j Â¼ 2012; 2013; 2014 <lb/>Where EM i,j is the age-adjusted excess mortality for comparison state i and post-policy year j; <lb/>Î» CA,j,k is the mortality rate for California in post-policy year j for age group k; pt i,j,k is the incar-<lb/>cerated person-time for comparison state i, post-policy year j, and age group k; and CR i,j is the <lb/>crude mortality rate for comparison state i and post-policy year j. A positive value for this <lb/>quantity suggests that the change in the marginal mortality rate associated with California&apos;s <lb/>pre-and post-policy age-specific mortality rates was greater than the change associated with <lb/>the control state&apos;s pre-and post-policy age-specific mortality rates, a negative value suggests <lb/>the opposite, and a value of zero suggests that there was no difference between the two. This <lb/>quantity can also be framed as a difference-in-differences estimate, for which California&apos;s age-<lb/>specific mortality rates applied to a control state&apos;s age distribution represent the treated unit <lb/>and the control states observed mortality rates represent the control unit. <lb/>For each post-policy year, we present the age-adjusted excess mortality rate estimates for <lb/>each control state, the median value, and exact confidence intervals. Exact confidence intervals <lb/>were obtained for the closest confidence levels above and below the 95% level via inversion of <lb/>the one-sample sign test. The sign test is a non-parametric statistical test that makes no distri-<lb/>butional assumptions about the underlying data distribution other than that data are drawn <lb/>independently from a continuous distribution. <lb/>We also conducted a placebo test using 2008 as the pre-policy year and 2010 as the post-pol-<lb/>icy year and present the median and exact confidence intervals as described above. These years <lb/>were selected so as to skip a single &quot;implementation&quot; year as in the main analysis and because <lb/>2010 is the last year prior to the actual implementation of AB109. <lb/>Comparison states <lb/>A full summary of comparison states included in the crude and age adjusted mortality analyses <lb/>and rationale for any exclusions are provided in S1 Appendix. <lb/>Sensitivity analysis for differences in mortality reporting <lb/>As previously described, our comparison of changes in age-standardized mortality rates <lb/>between California and other states leveraged multiple complementary datasets.

			<body>small differences between the annual number of deaths among California state prisoners in the <lb/>DIC and BJS data, with DIC data consistently reporting fewer deaths than the BJS data (Sup-<lb/>plemental Table 3 in S1 Appendix). For the main analysis, we used the deaths present in the <lb/>DIC data. To account for the possibility that DIC data are not comprehensive and that the BJS <lb/>data represent the truth, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we added deaths to the <lb/>DIC data such that the annual number of deaths matched the number in the BJS data for 2010 <lb/>and each post-policy year 2012-2014. Over 1000 iterations, we randomly assigned the added <lb/>deaths to different age groups (with equal probability), calculated the age-adjusted excess mor-<lb/>tality rate estimates for each state and post-policy year, and calculated the median value for <lb/>each post policy year. We then present the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the distributions of the <lb/>median values for each post-policy year. <lb/>Bias analyses for concurrent policy changes <lb/>Two sources of potential bias in estimating the effects of AB109 on California state prisoner <lb/>mortality are the nearly concurrent introduction of the medical parole program and the subse-<lb/>quent introduction of the elderly parole program in the California state prison system. The <lb/>medical parole program began in January 2011, granted its first parole in June 2011, and was <lb/>expanded in July 2014. This program initiated a parole hearing process that allowed grantees <lb/>who are permanently medically incapacitated and who require 24-hour care to be placed in a <lb/>licensed healthcare facility in the community. The elderly parole program began in October <lb/>2014 and initiated a parole hearing process by which prisoners over 60 years old who have <lb/>served at least 25 years of continuous incarceration could be assessed for parole. An elderly <lb/>parole hearing differs from a standard parole hearing in that the panel gives special attention <lb/>to the prisoner&apos;s age, physical condition, and long-term confinement when determining a pris-<lb/>oner&apos;s suitability for parole. <lb/>These two programs may have implications for our analysis because they were introduced <lb/>after the end of the pre-policy period and could have impacted the mortality rate among Cali-<lb/>fornia state prisoners if those granted parole through the programs were at systematically <lb/>higher or lower risk of death than those who remained incarcerated. If this were the case, any <lb/>changes in mortality in the post-policy period could be at least partially due to the initiation of <lb/>these parole programs. <lb/>We sought to assess the impact of these parole programs on the results of our comparison <lb/>of age-standardized mortality rates between California and other states. It seems reasonable to <lb/>assume that medical parolees would be at greater risk of death than other age-comparable pris-<lb/>oners, and thus their release from custody may have resulted in a reduction in age-specific <lb/>prisoner mortality rates. However, two points are worth noting. First, medical parole differs <lb/>from compassionate release, which involves a recall of sentence for California state prisoners <lb/>who are terminally ill and are estimated to have less than six months to live. Although medical <lb/>parolees are permanently medically incapacitated, they are not necessarily terminally ill. Sec-<lb/>ond, there were never more than seven medical parole deaths during any post-policy year <lb/>(Supplemental Table 4 in S1 Appendix), which represent a small fraction of the annual number <lb/>of deaths among California state prisoners. Regarding the elderly parole program, we have no <lb/>specific reason to expect elderly parolees to be more or less at risk of death than age-compara-<lb/>ble prisoners who remained incarcerated. <lb/>To assess the sensitivity of our age-standardized analysis results to the introduction of the <lb/>medical parole program, we calculated age-standardized excess mortality rates as described <lb/>above but included deaths among California medical parolees and person time attributed <lb/>among these deceased medical parolees in the calculation of the age-specific annual California <lb/></body>

			<body>mortality rates. Deaths among medical parolees were present in the DIC data and were <lb/>excluded from our main analysis. In addition, we re-ran the sensitivity analysis described <lb/>above to correct for differences in death counts between DIC and BJS data, but for each itera-<lb/>tion we added medical parolee deaths after updating the annual DIC death counts to match <lb/>those reported by BJS. <lb/>Because the medical parole program began after the end of the pre-policy period, including <lb/>deaths among California medical parolees had no effect on the synthetic control fit for our <lb/>crude mortality analysis. Their inclusion increased California&apos;s observed mortality rate by <lb/>&lt;2% for each post-policy year and thus we do not present this sensitivity analysis for crude <lb/>mortality. <lb/>To explore the potential impact of the elderly parole program on the California prison mor-<lb/>tality rate, we compared the trend in the mortality rate among California state prisoners aged <lb/>60 and older before and after the start of the elderly parole program to the trend in rate among <lb/>prisoners younger than 60. Specifically, we calculated mortality rates separately among prison-<lb/>ers above and below age 60 for each calendar quarter in 2013 and 2014. Because the variance <lb/>of quarterly mortality rates among prisoners aged 60 and older were substantially larger than <lb/>those among prisoners under 60 (60 and older variance = 100,463; under 60 variance = 530), <lb/>we calculated the change in quarterly mortality rate since the rate in the first quarter (Q1) of <lb/>2013 standardized by the standard deviation of quarterly rates in 2013-2014 for each group. If <lb/>the beginning of the elderly parole program led to a meaningful change in the mortality rate <lb/>among prisoners aged 60 and older, we might expect to observe a standardized change in the <lb/>mortality rate among this group in Q4 2014 that is not evident among prisoners under 60. <lb/>Results <lb/>Crude mortality <lb/>The composition of the synthetic California is presented in Supplemental Table 5 in S1 Appen-<lb/>dix, the crude mortality rates for California and the synthetic California are presented in Fig 1, <lb/>and the difference between California&apos;s annual mortality rate and those for the synthetic Cali-<lb/>fornia are presented in Fig 2. Mortality among California state prisoners increased after the <lb/>implementation of AB109 in 2011 relative to those of the synthetic California, but the two <lb/>rates converged by 2014. These estimates suggest that, without accounting for age distribution <lb/>changes, the mortality rate among California state prisoners was higher in 2012 and 2013 than <lb/>would have been expected in the absence of AB109. Results of all permutation tests and robust-<lb/>ness checks are provided in S1 Appendix. <lb/>It is worth noting that the 2012 crude mortality rate for California reported by the BJS is <lb/>and used in this analysis likely to over-estimate the true mortality rate (in deaths per person-<lb/>time). The BJS uses the year-end custody population as the denominator for calculating annual <lb/>rates, and AB109 led to a large and rapid reduction in the prison population that did not stabi-<lb/>lize until the end of 2012. Specifically, the yearend custody populations reported by BJS for <lb/>2011 and 2012 were 147,051 and 132,624, respectively. As a result of this reduction from year-<lb/>end 2011 to yearend 2012, the yearend population will under-estimate the true incarcerated <lb/>person-time more in 2012 than in other years. <lb/>Changes in prisoner age distributions <lb/>After the implementation of AB109, the proportion of California state prisoners in older age <lb/>groups increased and those in lower age groups decreased (Fig 3).

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Following the implementation of AB109, California prisons experienced an increase in crude <lb/>mortality that attenuated by 2014 and appears to be attributable to a concurrent shift in the age <lb/>distribution of California state prisoners. When accounting for this change in the age distribu-<lb/>tion, California&apos;s change in mortality rate appeared consistent with those of other states in the <lb/>first two post-policy years but exhibited a greater reduction relative to other states in the third <lb/>year after implementation. This is the first study evaluating California state prisoner mortality <lb/>following the implementation of California&apos;s historic criminal justice initiative, and our analy-<lb/>sis suggests improved mortality outcomes three years after implementation. <lb/>The results of our synthetic control analysis suggest that the crude mortality among Califor-<lb/>nia state prisoners increased relative to what would have occurred in the absence of AB109, <lb/>with the largest increase occurring in 2012. This finding is supported by our permutation test <lb/>when restricting to control states with good pre-policy fits and our robustness checks. How-<lb/>ever, as previously noted, the crude mortality among California state prisoners that is reported <lb/>by BJS and used in this analysis over-estimates the true mortality rate in 2012, thus the magni-<lb/>tude of the effect in this year is likely exaggerated. Importantly, our age-focused analyses sug-<lb/>gest that this increase is attributable to a substantial shift in the age distribution of California <lb/>state prisoners as opposed to other mechanisms elevating prisoners&apos; mortality risk. We <lb/>explored this possibility in three ways. <lb/>First, we found that California experienced a shift in age distribution among prisoners that <lb/>was more extreme than most comparison states, particularly in regards to increasing propor-<lb/>tions of older prisoners, following the implementation of AB109. AB109 provisions were <lb/>implemented prospectively such that that new low-level offenders would be incarcerated in <lb/>county jails instead of state prisons but existing state prisoners would not be transferred to <lb/>county jails or granted early release. Although both admissions and releases declined after <lb/>AB109, the reduction in California&apos;s prison population was driven by a decline in admissions <lb/>that exceeded the corresponding decline in releases. The rapid change in the age distribution <lb/>of California&apos;s prisoner population following AB109 aligns with the fact that that older prison-<lb/>ers are more likely to be serving longer sentences [31], such that prisoners released in a given <lb/>year are disproportionately younger than the overall prisoner population. Prior to AB109, <lb/>these releases would be approximately offset by new admissions, but new admissions were <lb/>reduced under AB109, a dynamic that resulted in a smaller and older prisoner population. It is <lb/>well established that mortality risk increases with age both in and out of prisons [24, 32], thus <lb/>it is plausible that the age-shift precipitated by AB109 could increase the crude mortality rates. <lb/>Second, we found that the California state prisoner age-specific mortality rates actually <lb/>declined for nearly all age groups following the implementation of AB109. This is also reflected <lb/>in our finding that while the crude mortality rate increased from 2010 to 2012 and subse-<lb/>quently declined through 2014, the age-standardized rate declined over the entire period. <lb/>Lastly, in our comparison of changes in age-standardized mortality rates between California <lb/>and other states, we found no evidence that changes in California age-specific mortality rates were <lb/>systematically different from those of 13 comparison states from 2010 to 2012 or 2013, but we did <lb/>find that California&apos;s age-specific rates decreased more than those of all but one comparison state <lb/>in 2014. Furthermore, we presented evidence that if each comparison state had experienced Cali-<lb/>fornia&apos;s age-specific mortality rates before and after AB109, the median state would have experi-<lb/>enced nearly 50 fewer deaths per 100,000 prisoners compared to what was actually observed, or <lb/>approximately 20% relative to the median 2014 mortality rate among comparison states. <lb/>Taken together, our findings suggest that crude mortality increased among California state <lb/>prisoners following AB109 due to an evident change the age distribution and corresponding <lb/></body>

			<body>risk profile of California&apos;s incarcerated population, but that mortality within age strata <lb/>declined both relative to the year before implementation and relative to contemporaneous <lb/>changes in other states. Understanding the overall (i.e. crude) mortality risk of the incarcerated <lb/>population is critical for surveillance and healthcare planning; however, to understand how <lb/>the de-population of California&apos;s state prisons under AB109 may have impacted the health of <lb/>individual prisoners, it is essential to account for the concurrent change in age distribution <lb/>and the corresponding mortality risk. <lb/>The discrepant findings between our crude and age-adjusted analyses highlight an impor-<lb/>tant methodological consideration when studying trends or impacts of policies on population <lb/>measures. Specifically, researchers must take special care when applying methods and inter-<lb/>preting results when the internal composition of an aggregate population being studied may <lb/>change in a manner that impacts the outcome of intertest. In the present scenario, a careless <lb/>interpretation of the results of our synthetic control analysis might conclude that AB109 <lb/>increased the mortality risk among California state prisoners, which our age-adjusted analyses <lb/>suggest is not the case. Importantly, any approach effectively accounting for such dynamics <lb/>requires data at a level more granular than crude population measures (e.g., individual-level <lb/>data or measures stratified by relevant covariates), which might not always be available. <lb/>It is important to place our findings within the broader context of the California prison <lb/>healthcare system leading up to and following the implementation of AB109. As noted in the <lb/>Introduction, California&apos;s prison healthcare system has a unique and complex history dating <lb/>back decades from the implementation in AB109. Most notably, from 2006 through the end of <lb/>the study period, California&apos;s healthcare system was under full authority of a federal receiver <lb/>specifically tasked with improving the quality of care [20]. From 2008 to 2010, both the crude <lb/>and age-standardized mortality rates among California state prisoners increased; in fact, when <lb/>calculating age-standardized excess mortality rates for this period, California appeared to have <lb/>a greater increase in age-specific mortality rates than comparison states. Despite these <lb/>increases in the early years of the receivership, a 2015 report by the receiver summarized sub-<lb/>stantial improvements to the structure, processes, and outcomes related to medical care in Cal-<lb/>ifornia prisons since 2008, though it also noted extensive variability in quality of care at the <lb/>institutional level [20]. Also, from 2006 to 2014, a comprehensive death review process docu-<lb/>mented a reduction in the rate of medically preventable deaths [33]. In addition to these <lb/>changes that spanned the pre-and post-AB109 periods, the state opened the California Health <lb/>Care Facility (CHCF) in July 2013. The CHCF is a 54-building and nearly 3000-prisoner <lb/>capacity medical complex for prisoners with long-term medical or acute mental-health needs. <lb/>It is thus clear that the de-population of California prisons under AB109 occurred in tandem <lb/>with dedicated and seemingly effective efforts to improve the quality of medical care provided <lb/>to prisoners. Indeed, although the original court decision and subsequent Supreme Court <lb/>opinion for Coleman/Plata vs. Brown declared overcrowding as the primary reason for health-<lb/>care deficiencies, they also made clear that resolving overcrowding alone would not be suffi-<lb/>cient to improve the quality of care for prisoners. <lb/>The changes that spanned or occurred during the post-policy period offer potential expla-<lb/>nations for why we only observed the reduction in age-adjusted prisoner mortality in 2014, the <lb/>third year after the implementation of AB109. Although the CHCF opened in July 2013, the <lb/>receiver halted intake in January 2014 citing inadequate staffing and supply chain issues that <lb/>precluded effective provision of healthcare at the facility [34]. Following a series of improve-<lb/>ments, intake at CHCF resumed in July 2014 [35]. Thus, after a challenging first 6-12 months <lb/>in operation, CHCF may have impacted system-wide mortality rates by admitting and provid-<lb/>ing care for prisoners with the most complex and severe medical needs in 2014. Indeed, <lb/>CHCF&apos;s average end-of-month population was 366 across all 12 months in 2013 and 1,620 in <lb/></body>

			<body>2014 [36]. In addition, the state&apos;s death review process determined that the rate of medically <lb/>preventable deaths was relatively stable from 2009 to 2013 but decreased by one-third in 2014, <lb/>which aligns with our findings [33]. On the other hand, the average number of identified lapses <lb/>in care per prisoner death showed no meaningful trend prior to 2010 but decreased from 1.1 <lb/>in 2010 to 0.8 in 2012-2013 and to 0.5 in 2014 [33], which aligns with the timing of AB109 <lb/>implementation. It is worth noting that death is the most severe health outcome and that <lb/>improvements in medical care are likely to impact intermediate health outcomes before ulti-<lb/>mately impacting mortality. This is particularly true in the context of chronic conditions such <lb/>as diabetes or hypertension, which require ongoing care and management and are more preva-<lb/>lent among incarcerated populations [37]. In addition, the decline in California&apos;s prison popu-<lb/>lation resulting from AB109 mostly occurred in the first year after implementation, stabilizing <lb/>around 133,000 inmates by September 2012 [38]. Accordingly, it seems plausible that de-popu-<lb/>lation under AB109, not fully realized until late 2012, could have facilitated subsequent <lb/>improvements in the quality of prisoner care that would correspond to the observed lag <lb/>between the implementation of AB109 and changes in mortality. <lb/>Our study is novel in that it evaluates the impacts of decarceration on individuals who <lb/>remain incarcerated and that it focuses on a health outcome. Prior work has noted the poten-<lb/>tial for decarceration efforts to improve the health and well-being of prisoners by reducing <lb/>overcrowding and decreasing prisoner-to-staff ratios [39]; indeed, AB109 was predicated on <lb/>this idea [4]. However, as illustrated by other research evaluating AB109 [7, 8, 11-19], out-<lb/>comes related to public safety and recidivism tend to receive more attention among efforts to <lb/>understand the impacts of decarceration. Our findings that AB109 may have decreased the <lb/>risk of mortality among California state prisoners provides an important complement to this <lb/>other work, and allows for a more comprehensive view of the impacts of AB109 and of decar-<lb/>ceration more broadly. <lb/>The present study has several limitations. First, our synthetic control analysis and our age-<lb/>standardized excess mortality rate measures both rely on the assumption that the mortality <lb/>experience of other states can be used to approximate what would have occurred in California <lb/>in the absence of AB109, which is untestable. Second, we are unable to disentangle the mortal-<lb/>ity effects of de-population under AB109 and concurrent improvements in the quality of medi-<lb/>cal care in California&apos;s prisons that were prompted by the same lawsuits as AB109; however, <lb/>given that these were intended as concurrent and complementary strategies for improving <lb/>prisoner healthcare, we are not certain that it would be meaningful to do so. Third, only 29 <lb/>and 13 control states were included in the crude and age-adjusted analyses, respectively; how-<lb/>ever, the majority of states were excluded due to small population sizes and numbers of pris-<lb/>oner deaths or having integrated prison and jail systems, which may limit their comparability <lb/>to California, which has the nation&apos;s second largest state prison system. In addition, among <lb/>states included in the crude mortality analysis, there was no difference in the distributions of <lb/>crude mortality trends between those that were included and excluded from the age-adjusted <lb/>analysis. Fourth, our age-adjusted analysis combines data from multiple sources, which <lb/>involved population data of variable quality in NCRP data and discordant counts of annual <lb/>deaths among California state prisoners in the BJS and DIC data. We sought to address the <lb/>variable quality in the NCRP data by validating year-end custody counts against NPS data and <lb/>only retaining states that exhibited reasonable quality over the entire study period. We sought <lb/>to address the discordant death counts in our stochastic sensitivity analysis, which had trivial <lb/>effects on our estimates and no impact on our conclusions. It is important to note that broader <lb/>availability of reliable data on US prison populations, including health-related measures, <lb/>would mitigate the majority of these limitations and improve the ability of researchers to rigor-<lb/>ously evaluate the impacts of changes to the nation&apos;s prison systems. Indeed, a study surveyed <lb/></body>

Although the crude mortality rate increased initially, our findings suggest this <lb/>was due to an expected shift in age distribution of California state prisoners. When accounting <lb/>for this shift in age distribution, we found that mortality decreased more in California relative <lb/>to comparison states three years after the implementation of AB109. As other states seek to <lb/>reduce their prison populations to address overcrowding and corresponding healthcare defi-<lb/>ciencies, any assessment of California&apos;s experience with AB109 should consider this potential <lb/>benefit. <lb/></body>
