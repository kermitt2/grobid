			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Although breast cancer has conventionally been classified based <lb/>on the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), <lb/>progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor <lb/>receptor 2 (HER2), recent studies have indicated that the genomic <lb/>landscape of breast cancer extends far beyond these 3 receptors. 1 <lb/>Genomic profiling of tumor specimens has helped identify other <lb/>targets that may serve as driver mutations for the development of <lb/>breast cancer, contributing to the heterogeneity of this disease. 1-4 <lb/>The androgen receptor (AR) may be expressed in breast cancer. <lb/>Lehmann and colleagues identified a subtype of triple-negative <lb/>breast cancer (TNBC) characterized by the presence of the <lb/>androgen receptor (AR) and expression of other luminal genes <lb/>termed the luminal-androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. This <lb/>expression-based subtype was subsequently confirmed by other <lb/>authors. 1,2 <lb/>A better understanding of the relationship of AR, clinical <lb/>characteristics, and patient outcomes is needed to further <lb/>individualize patient care based on tumor biology. A recent study <lb/>demonstrated that varying subtypes of TNBC may respond <lb/>differently to neoadjuvant therapy. 5 It is likely that varying <lb/>subtypes within each of the conventional types of breast cancer <lb/>(hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2+, TNBC) may have <lb/>different clinical and prognostic features, and AR expression may <lb/>factor into this heterogeneity, across breast cancer subtypes. In <lb/>this study, we evaluated associations between AR gene expression <lb/>in primary breast cancer, clinical characteristics, and patient <lb/>outcomes in a well characterized subset of patients with early <lb/>stage breast cancer in the I-SPY 1 cohort. We also explored gene <lb/>correlations with AR and selected other genes involved in the <lb/>development of breast cancer, using three publically available <lb/>databases including I-SPY 1 (Investigation of Serial Studies to <lb/>Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging and Molecular <lb/>Analysis), 6,7 METABRIC, 4 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 8 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>I-SPY 1 tumor characteristics <lb/>Of the 149 patients with microarray data available, 25% (37) were <lb/>TNBC, 30% (45) were HER2+, and 58% (86) were hormone <lb/>receptor (HR)+. Of the patients with TNBC 86% were found to be <lb/>basal by expression profiling. <lb/>Association between AR expression and primary tumor <lb/>characteristics <lb/>In the I-SPY 1 dataset, AR expression was found to be significantly <lb/>lower in TNBC (i.e. HR−/HER2−) than HR+/HER2− and HER2+ <lb/>disease (Fig. 1a, p &lt; 0.00001), as expected and concordant with <lb/>previous literature. 9 When evaluated by intrinsic subtype, AR <lb/>expression was the lowest in basal breast cancer (Fig. 1b, p &lt; <lb/>0.00001). Significantly higher AR expression was also observed in <lb/>grade I/II versus grade III tumors (Fig. 1c, p &lt; 0.00001), and was <lb/>associated with older age &gt;50 (median AR expression, age &gt;50: <lb/>0.36 vs. age ≤50: −0.35, p = 0.05). These findings were also <lb/>observed in METABRIC. Additionally, in I-SPY 1 higher AR <lb/>expression was found in node negative versus node positive <lb/>disease (Fig. 1d, p = 0.006); no association was seen with <lb/>menopausal status (p = 0.70), clinical stage (p = 0.31), or lympho-<lb/>vascular invasion (p = 0.22). <lb/>Association between AR expression with patient chemotherapy <lb/>response and outcome <lb/>No significant association was observed between AR expression <lb/>and pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant <lb/>chemotherapy (median AR expression, pCR: −0.81 vs. non-pCR: <lb/>0.24, p = 0.12). At an optimal cut off point that maximizes survival <lb/>differences between AR-stratified groups (−0.89), higher AR <lb/>expression (&gt;−0.89) was associated with better recurrence-free <lb/>survival (RFS) (Fig. 2a, log-rank p = 0.0007). In a multivariable Cox <lb/>model adjusting for HR/HER2 subtypes, high AR expression <lb/></body>

			<body>remained significantly associated with better RFS (Wald test p = <lb/>0.01), suggesting that AR expression has prognostic value <lb/>independent of receptor subtypes. The Kaplan-Meier survival <lb/>plots of the AR-High vs. Low groups within each HR/ <lb/>HER2 subtypes are shown in Fig. 2b-d. High AR expression has <lb/>a significant or strong trend for association with better outcomes <lb/>within the HER2+ and HR+/HER2−, but not the HR-/HER2-<lb/>subtype (likely due to the small number of HR-/HER2-patients <lb/>with AR expression above −0.89). <lb/>Gene correlations with AR expression <lb/>We determined correlations between the gene expression of AR <lb/>and a set of 79 selected genes which may be involved in the <lb/>development of breast cancer, using the I-SPY 1, METABRIC, and <lb/>TCGA datasets in the population as a whole, and in the triple <lb/>negative (TN) cohorts of METABRIC and TCGA. Table 1 shows the <lb/>Pearson correlation coefficient of genes showing significant <lb/>correlation with AR expression in ≥2 datasets. <lb/>AR gene expression positively correlated with the expression of <lb/>multiple luminal genes including FOXA1, GATA3, AGR2, PIP, CA12, <lb/>ESR1, PGR, TOX3, MUC1, DHRS2, ITGB5, CCND1, and RET as well as <lb/>with the expression of steroid hormone genes such as ADRA2A, <lb/>PTGER3, GHR, and ADRB2. In addition, AR gene expression <lb/>positively correlated with the expression of HER2 pathway genes <lb/>including ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4, and the expression of <lb/>TNFSF10, KRAS, and PTEN. Most these gene correlations were <lb/>also apparent in the TN cohorts. <lb/>Significant inverse gene correlations with AR were noted with <lb/>the basal genes FOXC1, MYC, HORMAD1, SERPINB5, SOX10, ELF5, <lb/>VTCN1, SOX6, SOX8, TUBB2B, KIT, KRT5, and KRT14; in most cases, <lb/>these were observed in the TN cohorts as well. AR gene expression <lb/>also inversely correlated with the expression of DNA damage <lb/>repair genes, TOP2A and the PARPi-7 gene signature in the <lb/>population as a whole, and in the TN cohorts alone. Finally, a <lb/>significant inverse correlation between AR gene expression and <lb/>the expression of CRYAB was observed, both in the population as <lb/>a whole, and in the TN cohorts alone. <lb/>In addition, significant inverse correlations of AR expression <lb/>with mesenchymal genes, CDK6, EGFR, and PTGFR, and immune <lb/>genes FOXP3, RARRES1, CXCL9, CXCL10, STAT5A, STAT1, CTLA4, <lb/>PSMB9, LCK, CD2, and PDCD1 were noted; however, these <lb/>correlations were generally not seen in the TN cohorts, suggesting <lb/>that this may be related to HR/HER2 status rather than AR <lb/>expression. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The androgen receptor may characterize a discrete subtype of <lb/>breast cancer. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in the AR <lb/>pathway in patients enrolled in I-SPY 1, and utilized the METABRIC <lb/>and TCGA datasets for validation.

			<body>than in HR+/HER2− and HER2+ disease, and the lowest <lb/>expression in basal type breast cancer. Similarly, other authors <lb/>have noted increased expression of AR in HR+ than ER-disease, 10-<lb/>13 and a lower expression of AR in TNBC. 9 <lb/>We also observed that AR expression correlated with features of <lb/>less aggressive disease when evaluated across subtypes, with <lb/>higher expression in grade I/II versus III tumors in both I-SPY 1 and <lb/>METABRIC, and higher expression in node negative versus node <lb/>positive tumors in I-SPY 1. Our findings are concordant with those <lb/>of other authors who have demonstrated increased AR expression <lb/>in well differentiated tumors 11,14 and node negative disease. 13,15 <lb/>Additionally, higher AR expression correlated with older age (&gt;50) <lb/>in both I-SPY 1 and METABRIC, concordant with other data-<lb/>sets. 14,16 We did not find a correlation of increased AR expression <lb/>with lower disease stage in I-SPY 1, although others have observed <lb/>this finding. 15 <lb/>In concordance with the association of AR expression with <lb/>lower risk disease, we demonstrated that higher AR expression <lb/>correlated with better RFS in the I-SPY 1 dataset. The prognostic <lb/>significance is particularly interesting as the patients in the I-SPY 1 <lb/>cohort were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and AR <lb/>expression was not associated with higher rates of pathologic <lb/>complete response, suggesting that the prognostic impact may <lb/>not be as tightly related to chemotherapy response. The <lb/>association between AR and receptor subtypes may be a potential <lb/>confounding factor as the subtypes have distinct pathologic <lb/>complete response rates and prognosis. Indeed, AR expression <lb/>was high in HR+/HER2− patients who had the lowest pathologic <lb/>complete response rates but the best prognosis. 6 Nevertheless, AR <lb/>remained an independent prognostic factor in a Cox model <lb/>adjusting for receptor subtypes. <lb/>However, a caveat to these findings is that given the sample <lb/>size of the I-SPY1 dataset (n = 149), the number of patients with <lb/>various subtypes is small, limiting our ability to draw firm <lb/>conclusions about the impact of AR gene expression on outcomes. <lb/>Additionally, the cut point used for AR gene expression in this <lb/>analysis was data-derived and therefore the outcome data are <lb/>hypothesis generating and require validation in a different cohort <lb/>of patients. We recognize that I-SPY1 has a higher proportion of <lb/>high risk patients (due to the eligibility criteria of ≥3 cm and the <lb/>subtype distribution has a lower proportion of HR+/HER2− <lb/>tumors than one would expect based on the general population. <lb/>However, the association between AR gene expression and <lb/>subtypes (receptor or intrinsic), grade, and age were observed in <lb/>both the I-SPY 1 and METABRIC, which has a much higher <lb/>proportion (71%) of HR+/HER2− cases. Based on this assessment, <lb/>it is unlikely these findings are attributable to the skewed subtype <lb/>distribution of the I-SPY 1 cases. <lb/>Nevertheless, the majority of literature also suggests that AR <lb/>positivity may be associated with better outcomes. Several recent <lb/>studies have demonstrated an improvement in both disease free <lb/>survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in AR positive <lb/>tumors. 12,14,17-21 However, some authors have demonstrated the <lb/>opposite finding, i.e. that AR over-expression is associated with <lb/>worse survival outcomes, including an association with poor OS in <lb/>one study 22 (149 patient study), and worse DFS in AR + TNBC in <lb/>2 studies (Asano et al. 9 (61 patient study) and Jiang et al. 23 (137 <lb/>patient study)), with all of these studies utilizing immunohisto-<lb/>chemical (IHC) testing for AR assessment.

			<body>differences and variations in treatment patterns, a possible <lb/>explanation for these discordant findings is variability in the IHC <lb/>methodology used to assess AR expression.

Clearly there is not a consensus definition <lb/>for AR positivity by IHC, and in prospective clinical trials, the <lb/>optimal approach to defining AR positivity is also still being <lb/>debated, with recent clinical trials defining AR+ disease as <lb/>≥0-10% by IHC or by utilizing a genomic profiling assay. 24-26 An <lb/>advantage of the I-SPY 1 database is that AR positivity was defined <lb/>using expression microarrays, which have less variability than non-<lb/>standardized IHC analyses. <lb/>Consistent with our findings that AR expression is lower in triple <lb/>negative and basal subtype breast cancer, using the I-SPY 1, <lb/>METABRIC, and TCGA datasets (defining a positive gene correla-<lb/>tion as one seen in ≥2 datasets), we were able to demonstrate that <lb/>the gene expression of AR positively correlates with the <lb/>expression of a multitude of luminal genes. As expected, AR <lb/>expression also correlated with the gene expression of other <lb/>steroid hormones. AR also anti-correlated with basal, mesenchy-<lb/>mal, and immune genes. Many of these observations were also <lb/>noted in the TNBC cohorts of METABRIC and TCGA, suggesting <lb/>that AR receptor positivity may define a subset of TNBC with <lb/>luminal features consistent with the previously described LAR <lb/>subtype of TNBC. 1,10 <lb/>Understanding AR+ disease is particularly important in TNBC <lb/>where the mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, and few <lb/>targeted therapies are available. A recent phase II study evaluated <lb/>the use of bicalutamide, an androgen antagonist, in patients with <lb/>AR+/ER-metastatic breast cancer, defining AR positivity as IHC <lb/>&gt;10%. 24 Altogether 424 patients with ER-/PR-breast cancer were <lb/>screened of which 12% were AR positive. A clinical benefit rate <lb/>(CBR) of 19% (95% CI: 7-39%) was noted in the 26 evaluable <lb/>patients, and the median PFS was 12 weeks (95% CI: 11-22 weeks). <lb/>A second phase II study evaluated enzalutamide, an androgen <lb/>receptor inhibitor, in advanced AR + TNBC. 26 In the 118 intent-to-<lb/>treat population (AR &gt;0% by IHC), the CBR at 16 weeks was 25% <lb/>(95% CI: 17-33%) and median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI: <lb/>1.9-3.7 months), and these endpoints were slightly improved in <lb/>the evaluable population of 78 patients (AR ≥10% by IHC) where <lb/>the CBR at 16 weeks was 33% (95% CI: 23-45%) and the median <lb/>PFS was 3.3 months (95% CI: 1.9-4.1 months). Using a genomic <lb/>assay for AR expression (PREDICT AR+), 56 patients with a positive <lb/>PREDICT AR assay had a clinical benefit rate of 39% at 16 weeks, <lb/>and a median PFS of 16.1 weeks. 25 A third study evaluated <lb/>seviteronel, a selective CYP17 lyase and AR inhibitor in advanced <lb/>breast cancer, including TNBC, demonstrating the initial safety and <lb/>efficacy in TNBC (2 patients with clinical benefit at 4 months). 27 <lb/>These findings suggest potential value for therapies targeted to <lb/>AR. While response rates may be low, some of them are durable <lb/>which is encouraging for TNBC. Additional studies are exploring <lb/>orteronel in TNBC disease, 28 as well as combination therapy in AR+ <lb/>TNBC, including a study of enzalutamide and paclitaxel in the pre-<lb/>operative setting 29 and one study evaluating enobosarm, a <lb/>selective androgen receptor modulator, with pembrolizumab, an <lb/>immunotherapy agent. 30 <lb/>However, better definitions of AR positivity are clearly required <lb/>to identify patients likely to benefit from AR targeted therapies. <lb/>Our work establishes the feasibility in utilizing gene expression <lb/>microarrays for evaluating AR expression in tumor tissue, and this <lb/>is one potential platform that could be considered in future trials, <lb/>as it may circumvent the issue of non-standardization of <lb/>immunohistochemical assays to identify patients who may benefit <lb/>from AR blockade. However, further research is needed to <lb/>compare AR IHC and genomic assays. Unfortunately, this could <lb/>not be done using the I-SPY1 dataset as AR IHC results are not <lb/>available for this cohort. However, we noted a 0.73 correlation <lb/>coefficient between AR protein level as assessed using reverse <lb/>phase protein array (RPPA) and AR gene expression levels in TCGA <lb/>cohort. Additional research is needed to help AR gene expression <lb/>levels translate into routine clinical practice, similar to other <lb/>expression-based multi-gene signatures such as the Oncotype and <lb/>MammaPrint which are used in clinical decision making. The <lb/>development of a validated AR gene expression signature or <lb/>validated AR IHC threshold may enable clinicians to identify those <lb/>patients with metastatic breast cancer who may benefit from AR <lb/>targeted therapies, and for earlier stage disease, to aid in risk <lb/>prognostication. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Due to the retrospective nature of this study using only publicly available <lb/>data, ethics approval for the study was not required. <lb/>Study population <lb/>The I-SPY 1 (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic <lb/>Response With Imaging and Molecular Analysis) study was a multicenter <lb/>initiative performed by the American College of Radiology Imaging <lb/>Network (ACRIN), Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE), <lb/>and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). The design of this trial is <lb/>described elsewhere. 6,7 In summary, I-SPY 1 enrolled patients with early <lb/>stage breast cancer and ≥3.0 cm of disease in breast, without evidence of <lb/>distant metastases. Patients underwent a core biopsy of their breast tumor <lb/>at the time of enrollment, then during, and after completing neoadjuvant <lb/>chemotherapy. Patients received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant anthracycline <lb/>plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with 95% receiving a taxane prior <lb/>to undergoing surgery. Starting in 2005, patients with HER2+ disease also <lb/>received trastuzumab. Following surgery, patients received adjuvant <lb/>chemotherapy, trastuzumab, hormonal therapy (given to all patients with <lb/>HR+ disease), and/or radiation per physician discretion. <lb/>I-SPY 1 gene expression dataset <lb/>For 149 patients enrolled in I-SPY 1 (GSE22226), high quality gene <lb/>expression data, assayed with the Agilent 44K arrays, was generated from <lb/>the pre-neoadjuvant treatment biopsies; the clinical features of these 149 <lb/>patients did not vary significantly from the total sample size of 221 patients <lb/>evaluable. Previous studies have described the methodology by which the <lb/>microarray data was generated and processed, and the manner in which <lb/>molecular profiling was performed. 6 Specifically, the expression of AR was <lb/>taken as the median-centered log2-scaled loess-normalized expression <lb/>value of the A_23_P113111 probe. <lb/>METABRIC gene expression dataset <lb/>Normalized expression matrices of the METABRIC discovery and validation <lb/>cohorts, generated on the HT-12 v3 platform were obtained from http:// <lb/>www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/ (accession number EGAS00000000083). 4 ComBat was <lb/>used for batch adjustment when combining the discovery and validation <lb/>cohorts to yield a dataset containing 1992 samples. Data was annotated <lb/>using the corresponding array annotation file from GEO, and genes <lb/>represented by multiple probes are collapsed by averaging. The normal-<lb/>ized, batch-adjusted, gene-level expression data was median-centered <lb/>prior to analysis. <lb/>TCGA gene expression dataset <lb/>Normalized gene-level expression data, assayed by RNA-sequencing, for <lb/>817 primary breast cancers analyzed as part of the TCGA program was <lb/>obtained from the TCGA data portal website (http://tcga-data.nci.nih. <lb/>gov/tcga). Details of the data processing can be found in Ciriello et al. 8 <lb/>Association between AR primary tumor expression, clinical and <lb/>tumor characteristics, chemotherapy response, and outcome <lb/>Associations between AR expression and clinical and tumor characteristics <lb/>were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (for two-level factors) or <lb/>the Kruskal-Wallis test (for multi-level factors).

			<body>assessed in both I-SPY and METABRIC datasets included: patient age (≤50 <lb/>or &gt;50), menopausal status, clinical stage (stage I/I vs. III or inflammatory), <lb/>tumor HR and HER2 status, intrinsic subtype (basal vs. non basal), nodal <lb/>status (node positive vs. node negative), histologic grade (grade I/II vs. <lb/>grade III). <lb/>In addition, in the I-SPY 1 dataset, the associations between AR and <lb/>tumor lymphovascular invasion (presence vs. absence), as well as <lb/>chemotherapy response (pathologic complete response vs. not) were <lb/>assessed. We also evaluated the association of AR expression and <lb/>recurrence-free survival (RFS). First, we identified an optimal AR cut-point <lb/>which maximizes the survival difference between the AR-stratified groups. <lb/>Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed to visualize the survival <lb/>differences between AR-stratified groups in the overall I-SPY cohort and <lb/>within HR/HER2 subtypes. Significance in curve separation was assessed <lb/>using a log-rank test. A multivariate Cox analysis was used to evaluate the <lb/>association between AR and RFS, adjusting for HR/HER2 subtype. <lb/>Determination of external gene correlations with AR expression <lb/>We determined correlations between the gene expression of AR and a <lb/>selected set of genes that may be involved in the development of breast <lb/>cancer, including genes shown to be associated with the luminal, <lb/>mesenchymal, basal, and immune subtypes of TNBC, 2 as well as DNA <lb/>damage repair deficiency genes including TDG and a seven gene <lb/>signature shown to be associated with response to the poly ADP ribose <lb/>polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib, the PARPi-7. 31 This signature was <lb/>calculated on median-centered expression data in simplified form as <lb/>PARPi-7 = −0.5320*BRCA1 + 0.5806*CHEK2 + 0.0713*MAPKAPK2 − <lb/>0.1396*MRE11A − 0.1976*NBN − 0.3937*TDG −0.2335*XPA. Gene corre-<lb/>lations were determined in all 3 datasets, I-SPY 1, METABRIC, and TCGA, <lb/>as well as in the triple negative (TN) subsets of the 2 larger datasets, <lb/>METABRIC and TCGA. Gene associations were determined using Pearson <lb/>correlations with the Benjamini Hochberg correction for multiple testing <lb/>(p &lt; 0.05). <lb/></body>
