Asano 1 6 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>The capabilities of natural language models <lb/>trained on large-scale data have increased im-<lb/>mensely over the past few years. Downstream <lb/>applications are at risk of inheriting biases con-<lb/>tained in these models, with potential negative <lb/>consequences especially for marginalized groups. <lb/>In this paper, we analyze the occupational biases <lb/>of a popular generative language model, GPT-2, <lb/>intersecting gender with five protected categories: <lb/>religion, sexuality, ethnicity, political affiliation, <lb/>and name origin. Using a novel data collection <lb/>pipeline we collect 396k sentence completions <lb/>of GPT-2 and find: (i) The machine-predicted <lb/>jobs are less diverse and more stereotypical for <lb/>women than for men, especially for intersections; <lb/>(ii) Fitting 262 logistic models shows intersec-<lb/>tional interactions to be highly relevant for occu-<lb/>pational associations; (iii) For a given job, GPT-2 <lb/>reflects the societal skew of gender and ethnicity <lb/>in the US, and in some cases, pulls the distribu-<lb/>tion towards gender parity, raising the normative <lb/>question of what language models should learn. <lb/>Code is available at https://github.com/ <lb/>oxai/intersectional_gpt2. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>The advent of deep learning and massive growth in training <lb/>data have led to natural language models surpassing humans <lb/>on numerous benchmarks (Wang et al., 2018; 2019; He et al., <lb/>2020; Adiwardana et al., 2020). However, as Bender et al. <lb/>(2021) states, these models can exacerbate existing biases <lb/>in data and perpetuate stereotypical associations to the harm <lb/>of marginalized communities. Simultaneously, pre-trained <lb/>models have become readily accessible via APIs, allowing <lb/>non-experts to apply these tools in their own applications. <lb/></body>

Related Work <lb/>Bias in classical NLP models. Extensive research has <lb/>shown that unrestricted training of natural language mod-<lb/>els inherits human biases and, in some cases, amplifies <lb/>them. (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Zhao <lb/>et al., 2018; Gonen &amp; Goldberg, 2019). Negative generaliza-<lb/>tions, stereotypes, or misrepresentations of particular social <lb/>groups can be learned by generative language models (Blod-<lb/>gett et al., 2020). These learned associations can persist in <lb/>tasks such as machine translation (Stanovsky et al., 2019), <lb/>dialogue systems (Liu et al., 2020), and hate speech classi-<lb/>fiers (Kennedy et al., 2020). There have been many attempts <lb/>to identify, quantify, and de-bias context-independent word <lb/>embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe (Bolukbasi et al., <lb/>2016; Zhao et al., 2019; Diaz et al., 2018). While these <lb/>earlier works investigate low-capacity models, we analyze a <lb/>high-capacity transformer-based generative language model, <lb/>GPT-2 (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019). <lb/>Bias in generative language models. Transformer-based <lb/>language models are increasingly replacing approaches us-<lb/>ing static word embeddings and current state-of-the-art lan-<lb/>guage models are trained on immense amounts of text col-<lb/>lected from the Internet (Fedus et al., 2021; Radford et al., <lb/>2019; Brown et al., 2020). The vastly improved model per-<lb/>formance and capacity has motivated many downstream ap-<lb/>plications, such as dialogue generation (Dinan et al., 2020), <lb/>automatically generated video captions (Tatman, 2017), and <lb/>job application assessment (Bhatia et al., 2019; Li et al., <lb/>2020). In terms of models, GPT-2, a transformer-based lan-<lb/>guage model trained on 40GB of text from over 8 million <lb/>documents from the Internet, has been the subject of various <lb/>studies (Wick et al., 2020; Budzianowski &amp; Vulic, 2019; <lb/>Ethayarajh, 2019). <lb/>Researchers have attempted to quantify and mitigate bi-<lb/>ases in generative language models: Zhao et al. (2019) find <lb/>systematic gender biases in ELMo&apos;s contextualized word <lb/>vectors and Bhardwaj et al. (2020) measure the ways in <lb/>which gender bias in BERT affects emotion and sentiment <lb/>intensity. Kurita et al. (2019) quantify gender bias in BERT <lb/>by measuring gendered occupations and adjectives, while <lb/>Sheng et al. (2019) utilize template-based methods to quan-<lb/>tify gender bias in texts generated by GPT-2, with sentiment <lb/>scores as a proxy for bias. Building on these methodologies, <lb/>we focus on intersectional biases of GPT-2 with regards to <lb/>the domain of occupations. <lb/>Intersectional biases. As Crenshaw (1989) explains, in-<lb/>tersectional biases are a necessary consideration because a <lb/>single axis of analysis treating gender and race as mutually <lb/>exclusive categories distorts the reality of marginalized com-<lb/>munities (such as Black women). More recently, Foulds &amp; <lb/>Pan (2020) provides definitions of fairness in machine learn-<lb/>ing systems informed by the framework of intersectionality. <lb/>The intersections between gender and racial biases have <lb/>been studied in sentiment analysis (Kiritchenko &amp; Moham-<lb/>mad, 2018) and generative language models such as BERT <lb/>and GPT-2 (Tan &amp; Celis, 2019). As well as race and gender, <lb/>we extend our analysis to intersections with other legally <lb/>protected categories that have historically been subject to <lb/>discrimination: religion, sexuality, and political affiliation. <lb/>3.

To proxy for the most popular model version, we <lb/>use the 124M hyperparameter model as it was the most-<lb/>downloaded version of GPT-2 available on HuggingFace <lb/>(see Appendix A, Tab. 1) ). We also confirm that our results <lb/>hold true for another generative model, XLNet (Yang et al., <lb/>2019) (see Appendix B). <lb/>Our data collection pipeline is shown in Fig. 2. We prompt <lb/>GPT-2 with prefix templates, as defined by Sheng et al. <lb/>(2019). The template is &quot;The [X][Y ] works as a&quot;, where <lb/>X is one of the following protected classes: ethnicity, reli-<lb/>gion, sexuality, and political affiliation, and Y is &apos;man&apos; or <lb/>&apos;woman&apos;. For a baseline to intersectional effects, we leave <lb/>X blank (i.e. &quot;The man/woman works as a&quot;). From these <lb/>28 unique templates (Tab.1), we generate 7,000 sentences <lb/>using GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) through the Hugging-<lb/>Face API with a top-k parameter of 3 and model size &apos;small&apos;. <lb/>Generated sentences are limited to a maximum length of 10 <lb/>words to capture immediate occupation associations. <lb/>Name-based templates. An additional prefix template is <lb/>created of the form &quot;[Z] works as a&quot;, where Z is a name <lb/>sampled from the most popular male and female first names <lb/>per country, obtained from Wikipedia. 2 We aggregate the <lb/>names into five geographic groups: Africa, Americas, Asia, <lb/>Europe, Oceania. We sample 20 names for each geographic <lb/>group and gender pair, yielding 200 unique templates, from <lb/>which we generate 1,000 sentences each. By prompting <lb/>GPT-2 with a template devoid of inherently gendered or <lb/>racialized terms, such as &apos;man/woman&apos; or &apos;Asian/Black&apos;, <lb/>we can better examine the latent associations when GPT-2 <lb/>estimates the ethnicity and gender from first names. <lb/>Occupation entity recognition. For each generated sen-<lb/>tence, we use the Stanford CoreNLP Named Entity Recog-<lb/>nizer (NER) (Manning et al., 2014) to extract &quot;job titles.&quot; 3 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ <lb/>ner.html <lb/></note>

			<body>NER was unable to detect titles for some sentences which <lb/>were removed from the dataset, losing 10.6% of gender-<lb/>occupation sentences and 19.6% of name-occupation sen-<lb/>tences. 4 We then create a one-hot encoded frequency ma-<lb/>trix for returned job tokens, combining duplicate jobs (e.g. <lb/>nurse/nurse practitioner). However, we do not merge job <lb/>tokens with inherent hierarchies (e.g. assistant profes-<lb/>sor/professor) or implicit gender associations (e.g. sales-<lb/>man/salesperson, waitress/waiter). Sentences returning mul-<lb/>tiple titles (e.g. &quot;The woman works as a waitress and a <lb/>maid&quot;) were treated as two separate entries in the frequency <lb/>matrix given that individuals can have more than one job. <lb/>3.2. Empirical Analysis <lb/>The distribution of returned jobs is highly-skewed with long <lb/>tails: a few jobs comprise a significant share and many jobs <lb/>are mentioned infrequently. Therefore, we apply a lower-<lb/>bound threshold to focus our analysis, removing tokens men-<lb/>tioned in fewer than 0.25% of total calls which preserves <lb/>approximately 80% of the sample (Tab.1). For jobs above <lb/>the threshold, we run a logistic regression on the one-hot <lb/>matrix and output frequencies to predict p([job] = 1|X, Y ) <lb/>for the input &quot;The [X][Y ] works as a [job]&quot;. While GPT-2 <lb/>is a &apos;black-box&apos; model, this predictive modelling attempts <lb/>to estimate how intersectional categories change GPT-2&apos;s <lb/>prior on the probability of job associations. By using in-<lb/>teraction terms, we can study whether intersectionality has <lb/>additional influence beyond main effects (e.g. the isolated <lb/>effect of gender and ethnicity). The logistic regression equa-<lb/>tion includes &apos;man&apos; from the baseline case as the reference <lb/>group, with dummy variables added for woman, for each <lb/>intersectional category C, and for interaction terms: <lb/>log odds(p(job i |c)) = β 0 + β 1 Woman i + <lb/>(1) <lb/>C <lb/>c=1 <lb/>γ ic Category i c + <lb/>C <lb/>c=1 <lb/>δ ic Category ic * Woman i + i , <lb/>where log odds(p) = log(p/(1 − p)) is the log-odds ratio. <lb/>4. Results <lb/>We analyze the effect of gender on returned occupational <lb/>distributions in Sec 4.1 and on particular occupations in <lb/>Sec 4.2. We extend these analyses to intersectional associa-<lb/>tions in Sec 4.3 and present empirical results derived from <lb/>logistic regressions in Sec 4.4. Finally, we compare and <lb/>quantify the predicted distributions against real-world US <lb/>occupational data in Sec 4.5. <lb/></body>

GPT-2 occupational stereotyping. GPT-2 stereotypes <lb/>the occupational distribution of women more than that of men. <lb/>4.1. Gender differences in distributions <lb/>Fig. 3 ranks the frequency of jobs against the cumulative <lb/>share. While 16 jobs account for 50% of the outputs for <lb/>men, only 8 jobs account for the same share for women. <lb/>Similarly, at the 90% level, men are associated with more <lb/>jobs than women (66 vs 43, respectively). This suggests <lb/>that GPT-2 predicts a wider variety of jobs for men and a <lb/>narrower set of jobs for women. The Gini coefficients 5 in <lb/>Tab. 2 confirm this more unequal distribution for women. <lb/>4.2. Gender differences in occupations <lb/>In addition to distributional differences, the set of returned <lb/>jobs also differ by men and women. In Fig. 4, we show the <lb/>proportion of genders in all jobs mentioned more than 35 <lb/>times for baseline man and woman. We make two obser-<lb/>vations: first, there is a greater number of jobs dominated <lb/>by men as compared to women, reflecting the greater di-<lb/>versity of occupations for men. Second, the occupations <lb/>seem stereotypical: men are associated with manual jobs <lb/>such as laborer, truck driver, and mechanic, and with profes-<lb/>sional jobs such as software engineer and private investiga-<lb/>tor. Women are associated with domestic and care-giving <lb/>roles such as babysitter, maid, social worker, and house-<lb/>wife. Furthermore, over 90% of the returns for &apos;prostitute&apos; <lb/>were women, and over 90% of returns for &apos;software engi-<lb/>neer&apos; were men. We only find three jobs for which GPT-2&apos;s <lb/>outputs suggest a gender-neutral prior over occupations: <lb/>reporter, lawyer, and sales representative. <lb/></body>

Intersectional analysis <lb/>The previous analysis indicates considerable differences be-<lb/>tween genders. We ask the following question: Do these <lb/>stereotypical male and female jobs change when inter-<lb/>sectionality is considered? The Gini coefficients (Tab. 2) <lb/>for gender-intersection pairs indicate a greater clustering of <lb/>women into fewer jobs across all intersections, especially for <lb/>sexuality and religion. To analyze differences in job associa-<lb/>tions for each intersection, we display a scatter plot with the <lb/>equi-proportion line given by (1/|c|, 0) to (0, 1/|c|), where <lb/>|c| is the number of choices for intersection c. We normalize <lb/>the axis such that 1/|c| = 1x so that jobs lie on this line if <lb/>adding intersections has no effect on the gender ratio. We <lb/>further include a bar plot showing the extremes of the dis-<lb/>tribution with the top ten jobs with the largest man-woman <lb/>range. <lb/>Ethnicity. For gender and ethnicity intersections (Fig. 5), <lb/>we find a similar pattern of occupations associated with <lb/>men (plumber, guard, contractor, and police officer) and <lb/>others with women (secretary, prostitute, model, babysitter). <lb/>While all ethnicities of women are associated with prostitute, <lb/>only Black men are. Overall, few occupations are solely <lb/>associated with men or women of a certain ethnicity, and <lb/>are mostly distributed over several ethnicities. <lb/>Religion. For gender and religion intersections (Fig. 6), <lb/>Hindu men and women only have associations with non-<lb/>religious professions (e.g. bouncers and massage therapists). <lb/>For Christian, Buddhist, and Jewish religions, there is a <lb/>tendency of GPT-2 towards generating occupations with <lb/>large man-woman disparities, especially for professional <lb/>religious occupations: nuns are dominated by Buddhist <lb/>women, rabbis are dominated by Jewish men, and monks, <lb/>pastors, and priests are dominated by Buddhist and Christian <lb/>men. <lb/>Sexuality. For gender and sexuality intersections (Fig. 7), <lb/>we find professions such as massage therapist, counselor, <lb/>and graphic designer to be almost unique to lesbian women, <lb/>while professions such as detective, plumber, guard, and <lb/>coach are dominated by straight men.

The exception <lb/>is that liberal men are strongly associated with critic and <lb/>banker, and conservative men with driver and host. <lb/>Name origin. For gender and continent name origin inter-<lb/>sections (Fig. 9), jobs are more tightly distributed around <lb/>the equi-proportion line. This suggests that name origin has <lb/>less of an effect on the token returned by GPT-2 than when <lb/>adding an explicit categorical intersection (e.g. ethnicity <lb/>or religion). Gender continues to be the more significant <lb/>determinant on the occupations generated by GPT-2, with <lb/>men being associated with jobs such as mechanic and leader, <lb/>and women being associated with jobs such as nurse and <lb/>receptionist. <lb/>4.4. Logistic Regression <lb/>The previous visual analyses demonstrate the considerable <lb/>differences in the jobs associated with women and men, <lb/>and further show that these gender splits remain when inter-<lb/>sections are added. Next, we address the question: quan-<lb/>titatively, how important are gendered intersections in <lb/>determining the job returned by GPT-2? Tab. 3 presents <lb/>summary results from 262 logistic regressions, which pre-<lb/>dict the likelihood of a job being associated with a given sen-<lb/>tence prompt. We focus on two metrics indicating how often <lb/>the addition of regressors adds explainability of the outcome: <lb/>i) The proportions of regressions where the woman dummy <lb/>and the interactions were significant (p &lt; 0.05), and ii) <lb/>The change in Pseudo-R 2 on the addition of the woman <lb/>dummy and the interactions. 6 Statistical results, including <lb/>the coefficients, for all regressions are in Appendix D. The <lb/>aggregated results in Tab. 3 show that the woman dummy <lb/>is frequently significant, most commonly so in ethnicity <lb/></body>

These results suggest that some <lb/>intersections are more salient in changing the returned job <lb/>from a given sentence prompt, and may anchor GPT-2 on <lb/>a stereotypical occupation set. In general, across a wide <lb/>range of jobs, gender and intersectionality are significant <lb/>determinants of the token returned by GPT-2. <lb/>4.5. Comparison to Labor Market Ground Truth <lb/>A comparison of GPT-2&apos;s predictions to the true labor mar-<lb/>ket distribution requires recent data disaggregated by gender <lb/>and intersection for a granular set of occupations. The <lb/>2019 US Labor Force Statistics from the Current Popula-<lb/>tion Survey (US Labor Bureau of Statistics, 2019) reports <lb/>the gender and ethnicity shares of workers in 567 occupa-<lb/>tional categories. We recognize a number of limitations <lb/>of this data, which we address in the discussion. We first <lb/>select the 50 most frequently mentioned jobs by GPT-2. <lb/>Then from these, we match GPT-2&apos;s job tokens to real <lb/>US occupation titles, finding correspondences for 41/50 <lb/>titles (see Appendix C). We compute GPT-2&apos;s predicted <lb/>proportional representation for each gender-ethnicity pair, <lb/>assuming the percentage of women is equal across ethnic-<lb/>ities: The &apos;predicted&apos; labor force has equal representation <lb/>across groups because we generate the same number of <lb/>sentence prompts per pair (n = 7,000). This is not the <lb/>case in reality, so the predicted proportions are scaled by <lb/>the true distribution of gender and ethnicity reported in the <lb/>US Labor Statistics and summarised in Appendix C. The <lb/></body>

			<body>scaling factor is γ(c) = G(c)E(c) <lb/>D(c) , where G(c), E(c) are the <lb/>gender-and ethnicity-shares of the US data, respectively <lb/>and D(c) = 12.5% is our artificial &quot;population&quot;-share: <lb/>adj. Pred(i, c) = γ(c) × Pred(i, c), <lb/>(2) <lb/>where Pred(i) is the share of job i for characteristics c. For <lb/>jobs reported in the US data, we calculate the difference <lb/>between the predicted proportions and the true proportions. <lb/>For a given job, how well does GPT-2 predict the gender-<lb/>ethnicity split? There are three possible cases: GPT-2 <lb/>overestimates the true representation of women in female-<lb/>dominated jobs (exacerbates societal skew), GPT-2 matches <lb/>the true proportional representation (directly inherits skew), <lb/>or GPT-2 underestimates the true proportional represen-<lb/>tation (corrects for skew). In Fig. 1, we find that most <lb/>predicted values lie close to the ground-truth given by the <lb/>identity line, indicating a high accuracy in prediction (mean-<lb/>squared errors of &lt; 2%). In particular, for the gender-<lb/>ethnicity intersections, the low mean-squared errors indicate <lb/>a considerable degree of similarity between GPT-2&apos;s pre-<lb/>dicted distribution and the ground truth distribution, espe-<lb/>cially for Asian and Black workers. Furthermore, it appears <lb/>that GPT-2 pulls the distribution further from the extremes; <lb/>that is, it under-predicts the extent of occupational segre-<lb/>gation. This is demonstrated by the fact that GPT-2 pre-<lb/>dicts a higher proportion of women than the ground truth in <lb/>male-dominated jobs with less than 25% women-share (on <lb/>average +8.7%) and predicts lower proportions of women in <lb/>jobs with more than 75% women-share (on average -6.5%). <lb/>The exceptions to this pattern are courier, bus driver and <lb/>photographer, for which GPT-2 under-predicts the propor-<lb/>tion of women, and social worker and model, for which <lb/>GPT-2 over-predicts the proportion of women. <lb/>For a given gender-ethnicity pair, how well does GPT-2 <lb/>predict the top jobs? This question aims to answer the ex-<lb/>tent of stereotyping of GPT-2 predictions. Tab. 4 shows the <lb/>top five predicted and ground truth jobs for each intersection. <lb/>GPT-2 predicts a high proportion of baseline women to be <lb/>waitresses (14%) but only Hispanic women have waitress <lb/>in the top five occupations, according to the US Labor data. <lb/>While GPT-2 predicts 18% of Hispanic women to be wait-<lb/>resses, in reality only 3% of Hispanic women in America <lb/>work as waitresses. Some of this strong association may <lb/>be because waitress is an inherently gendered job. GPT-2 <lb/>also over-predicts the number of nurses, predicting 11% <lb/>of women to be nurses when in reality only about 4% of <lb/>American women are nurses. Security guard is consistently <lb/>overpredicted for men of all ethnicities. Yet security guard <lb/>only appears as a top job for Black men and at a lower <lb/>frequency (2%) than the predicted frequency (8%). GPT-2 <lb/>over-predicts the proportion of janitors for all ethnicities, <lb/>especially for White and Asian men, for whom janitor does <lb/>not appear as a top job. <lb/>The share of the most popular occupation for each gender is <lb/>significantly higher for women (waitress at 14%) than for <lb/>men (security guard at 8%). The cumulative share of the top <lb/>five occupations is 41% for women, which is more than dou-<lb/>ble the ground truth observation (17%). While GPT-2 also <lb/>over-predicts the cumulative share of top five occupations <lb/>for men, the discrepancy to the US data is smaller (24% vs <lb/>10%). While GPT-2&apos;s tendency to aggregate women into a <lb/>small set of stereotypical jobs was identified in prior analysis <lb/>(Fig. 3 and Tab. 2), the comparison to US data corroborates <lb/>this result. <lb/>5. Discussion <lb/>Demographic distribution per occupation. Overall, we <lb/>find strong differences in the occupational tokens returned <lb/>by GPT-2 for gendered sentence prompts. At first glance, <lb/>it may seem biased that GPT-2 predicts so many women to <lb/>be maids or secretaries and so few to be plumbers or truck <lb/>drivers, but in fact, the model predicts less occupational <lb/>segregation by gender as compared to the US ground truth <lb/>distribution. It appears that GPT-2 is pulling the skews of <lb/>the distribution found in reality towards gender parity. <lb/>For ethnicity, GPT-2 accurately predicts the distribution of <lb/>occupations in real-world data with low mean-squared er-<lb/>rors, especially for Asian and Black workers. In addition to <lb/>gender and ethnicity, adding a religious intersection consid-<lb/>erably changes the returned jobs, especially for men. For <lb/>example, GPT-2 predicts 4% of Buddhist men to be monks. <lb/>There are an estimated 3.75 million Buddhists in the US <lb/>and approximately 1,000 Buddhist centers and monasteries <lb/>(Pew Research, 2020; Institute for Genealogical Studies, <lb/>2020). A back of the envelope calculation shows each of <lb/>these centers would need to employ more than 70 monks <lb/>each to reach the 4% threshold. Therefore, it is likely that <lb/>GPT-2 infers too strong of an association between practising <lb/>a religion and working in a religious profession. Intersec-<lb/>tions with continent-based names show that the returned <lb/>occupations are more similar to those of baseline man and <lb/>woman. This finding indicates that prompting GPT-2 with <lb/>explicit intersections like &apos;Buddhist man&apos; or &apos;Black woman&apos; <lb/>changes the probabilities of returned tokens to a greater ex-<lb/>tent than a name prompt where GPT-2 must independently <lb/>ascertain the gender and background of the individual. <lb/>Occupation distribution per demographic. Despite re-<lb/>flecting the gender-ethnicity proportions per real-world oc-<lb/>cupation, GPT-2 notably displays a bias towards predicting <lb/>greater occupational clustering for both genders, especially <lb/>for women. The Gini coefficients confirm that the female <lb/>distribution is more unequal than that of men. For the pre-<lb/>dictions generated by GPT-2, a larger and more diverse set <lb/>of occupations are associated with men than with women. <lb/>Gender-ethnicity predictions do not deviate much from the <lb/></body>

This signifies that <lb/>GPT-2 predicts the occupations for women with less variety <lb/>than for men, regardless of what ethnicity. <lb/>This is a different kind of bias than that normally discussed <lb/>in the algorithmic fairness literature. In reality, large propor-<lb/>tions of women do work as secretaries, receptionists, and <lb/>maids, and large proportions of men do work as mechanics, <lb/>plumbers, and carpenters. Therefore, GPT-2&apos;s bias is not in <lb/>the jobs associated with women, but in the rate at which it <lb/>associates women with such a small set of jobs, a pattern <lb/>exacerbated from the ground truth occupation data. <lb/>Limitations. This paper is subject to a number of limita-<lb/>tions. First, our chosen comparison to labor market data <lb/>renders the ground truth baseline inherently US-centric. Sec-<lb/>ond, without consistent, granular data on occupational splits <lb/>by religion, sexuality and political affiliation, we cannot <lb/>comment on how accurately GPT-2 reflects the ground truth <lb/>for these intersections. Third, for jobs in the informal sec-<lb/>tor, such as &apos;prostitute&apos;, we cannot compare to real-world <lb/>incidences. Additionally, if terms such as &apos;prostitute&apos; are <lb/>commonly used as slurs, GPT-2 may display a bias towards <lb/>over-estimating their proportion. Finally, by focusing only <lb/>on two genders, the results do not adequately reflect occu-<lb/>pational biases which may be associated with non-binary <lb/>gender identities. Future research is recommended to inves-<lb/>tigate ground truth comparisons across a broader range of <lb/>countries against the set of gender-intersections examined in <lb/>this paper and to comment on a broader spectrum of gender <lb/>identities. Doing so would be valuable in establishing poten-<lb/>tial areas of bias which risk being inherited by downstream <lb/>applications of generative language models such as GPT-2. <lb/>6. Conclusion <lb/>What should be the goal of generative language models? <lb/>It is certainly appropriate that they should not exacerbate <lb/>existing societal biases with regards to occupational segre-<lb/>gation. It is less clear whether they should reflect or seek <lb/>to correct skewed societal distributions. Compared to US <lb/>data, we identify a bias towards returning a small number <lb/>of stereotypical jobs too many times, especially for women. <lb/>However, for a given job, we find that GPT-2 reflects soci-<lb/>etal skew and, in some cases, errs on the side of correcting <lb/>for it. One proposed reason for this observed pattern is <lb/>over-representation in the training data towards &apos;exceptional <lb/>cases&apos;. If society expects women to be teachers and nurses, <lb/>it is possible that there are more training examples scraped <lb/>from social media platforms or newspaper articles of when <lb/>men occupy these stereotypes, or vice-versa with plumbers <lb/>and software developers. It remains to be seen whether <lb/>a larger training set improves or impairs occupational bi-<lb/>ases for intersections. Using the methodology developed <lb/>in this paper, it is possible and would merit future research <lb/>to determine the effect of model and training set size by <lb/>comparing GPT-3 relative to its younger sibling analyzed in <lb/>this work, GPT-2. This work presents the first comprehen-<lb/>sive analysis of protected class intersections with gender in <lb/>generative language models, and we hope that it will spark <lb/>new research further investigating biases on topics relevant <lb/>to downstream applications and intersectionality in AI more <lb/>broadly. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Supplementary Material: <lb/>How True is GPT-2? <lb/>An Empirical Analysis of Intersectional Occupational Biases <lb/>Note on language used in this paper <lb/> In our paper, we focus on the occupational associations with binary gender identities i.e. &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot;. While we do <lb/>sometimes refer to jobs dominated by women as &apos;female-dominated jobs&apos;, we do not make an explicit comparison to sex, i.e. <lb/>prompting GPT-2 with the &apos;female worker is a...&apos;. We feel strongly about the importance in studying non-binary gender and <lb/>in ensuring the field of machine learning and AI does not diminish the visibility of non-binary gender identities. In future <lb/>work, we hope to extend our analysis with the same data collection pipeline. For example, womxn is a umbrella term used in <lb/>the intersectional feminist community to be inclusive of transgender woman and non-binary individuals. The sentences <lb/>returned when prompting GPT-2 with &apos;womxn&apos; are primarily of two types: (i) stereotypical job associations e.g. &apos;drag <lb/>queen&apos;, &apos;feminist&apos;, &apos;crossdresser&apos; or &apos;nurse&apos;, and (ii) not recognizing &apos;womxn&apos; as a person noun e.g. &apos;The womxn works as a <lb/>kind of a noodle shop&apos;, &apos;The womxn works as a battery&apos;, &apos;The womxn works as a mauve-wool hat&apos; or &apos;The womxn works as <lb/>a kind of virtual sex toy&apos;. These preliminary findings suggest it is critical for future work to study occupational biases with <lb/>non-binary gender identities in generative language models. <lb/>A. GPT Model Downloads <lb/>We select the most downloaded version of GPT-2 available on HuggingFace as a proxy for popularity in use-cases by <lb/>experts and non-experts alike. In Tab. 5 we show the original GPT-2 models released by OpenAI (Radford et al., 2019) <lb/>and available on HuggingFace. The small version has an order of magnitude more downloads as compared to the medium <lb/>and XL versions. Further, larger models of GPT-2 have been shown to have an increased capability to memorize training <lb/>information, introducing privacy concerns (Carlini, 2020). Finally, while the environment cost of inference is cheap, Bender <lb/>et al. (2021) discuss how the environmental impact of training scales with model size, and the associated consequences <lb/>likely disproportionately affect marginalized populations. <lb/>Table 5. GPT-2 model available on Huggingface by number by total downloads (accessed 3rd February 2021) <lb/>Model <lb/># Hyperparameters # Public Downloads <lb/>GPT-2 Small <lb/>124M <lb/>623k <lb/>GPT-2 Medium <lb/>355M <lb/>77k <lb/>GPT-2 Large <lb/>774M <lb/>14k <lb/>GPT2 XL <lb/>1.5B <lb/>70k <lb/>B. Comparison with XLNet <lb/>XLNet sample generation. In addition to the suite of models released by Open-AI, XLNet is a generalized autoregressive <lb/>pre-training method which outperforms BERT across a number of benchmark tasks (Yang et al., 2019). To assess <lb/>the generalizability of our findings, we generate 7,000 sentences for the gender-occupation template (X = {}, Y = <lb/>{Man, Woman}), and analyze the returned occupational tokens from XLNet. Out of the total 14,000 returned sentences, <lb/>4,442 had no title recognized by the Stanford NLP Named Entity Recognizer. This sample loss of 31% is higher than GPT-2 <lb/>(Tab. 6). A plausible reason for this higher sample loss is in the way XLNet generates text which includes extra inverted <lb/></div>

Fig. 10 shows the rank of jobs against the cumulative share. While 11 jobs account for 50% of the <lb/>outputs for men, only 5 jobs account for the same share for women. Similarly, considering 90% of the output, women are <lb/>associated with fewer jobs than men (31 vs 46, respectively). This disparity is similar to the one that we found in GPT-2, <lb/>suggesting that XLNet also predicts a wider variety of jobs for men and a narrower set of jobs for women. <lb/>Table 7. XLNet: Top five jobs for base man and base woman <lb/>XLNet Jobs (Proportions) <lb/>Sum <lb/>Woman maid (0.27), waitress (0.14), prostitute (0.05), servant (0.04), nurse (0.04) <lb/>0.54 <lb/>Man <lb/>carpenter (0.11), mechanic (0.07), maid (0.05), waiter (0.05), taxi driver (0.04) 0.32 <lb/>Top occupations. Tab. 7 shows the top five jobs for men and women as predicted by XLNet. Similar to our observations for <lb/>gender differences predicted by GPT-2, we see a higher cumulative share in the top jobs for women as compared to men. <lb/>The top job for woman (maid at 27%) represents a substantially larger proportion than the top job for man (carpenter at <lb/>11%). Interestingly, men are predicted to be maids 5% of the time, which was a pattern that we did not see with GPT-2. <lb/>Fig. 11 shows the proportion of genders in all jobs mentioned more than 35 times for baseline man and woman. This is the <lb/>same threshold as the one we used to calculate the analogous gender parity graph for GPT-2 jobs. Men and woman are <lb/>associated with stereotypical jobs, but slightly different ones than those predicted by GPT-2. In this case, we see that men <lb/>are associated with a variety of jobs, such as courier, barber, teller, magician, and builder. Women are, yet again, associated <lb/>with domestic and care-giving jobs, such as nanny, housewife, and nurse.

Processing <lb/>C.1. Named Entity Recognition <lb/>We used Stanford CoreNLP Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract job titles from the sentences generated by GPT-2. <lb/>Using this approach resulted in the sample loss of 10.6% for gender-occupation sentences and 19.6% for name-occupation <lb/>sentences (see Tab. 6). The sample loss was due to Stanford CoreNLP NER not recognizing some job titles e.g. &quot;Karima <lb/>works as a consultant-development worker&quot;, &quot;The man works as a volunteer&quot;, or &quot;The man works as a maintenance man at a <lb/>local...&quot;. <lb/>C.2. Adjustment Factors <lb/>When comparing to the US data, some adjustments are made to ensure fair comparison. Firstly, there are no breakdowns <lb/>by gender and ethnicity in the US Labor Bureau data so we assume the proportion of women are equal across ethnicities. <lb/>Secondly, for each gender-ethnicity pair, we generate the same number of sentence prompts per pair (n = 7,000). This <lb/>implies the &apos;predicted&apos; labor force has equal representation across groups which is not the case in reality. Accordingly, the <lb/>predicted proportions are scaled by the true distribution of gender and ethnicity reported in the US Labor Statistics. The <lb/>scaling factor is: γ(c) = G(c)E(c) <lb/>D(c) , where G(c), E(c) are the gender-and ethnicity-shares of the US data, respectively and <lb/>D(c) = 12.5% is our artificial &quot;population&quot;-share: <lb/>adj. Pred(i, c) = γ(c) × Pred(i, c), <lb/>(3) <lb/>where Pred(i) is the share of job i for characteristics c. Tab. 8 shows the true proportions and the steps made in the adjustment <lb/>process. <lb/></div>

Matching GPT-2 and US Jobs <lb/>The US data has four nested levels of disaggregation e.g. Management, professional, and related occupations → Professional <lb/>and related occupations → Computer and mathematical occupations → Computer Programmer. For GPT-2&apos;s 50 most <lb/>frequently mentioned jobs, we match the GPT-2 job title to one in the US data at the lowest nested level, apart from <lb/>&apos;salesperson&apos; and &apos;manager&apos; which are too general to match to the lowest disaggregation. For these, we match to &apos;sales and <lb/>related occupations&apos;, and &apos;management occupations&apos;, respectively. In total, we find correspondences for 41/50 jobs. Jobs <lb/>were not matched for three reasons: (i) there were too many varied mentions of a job e.g. &apos;clerk&apos; was associated with 25 <lb/>different jobs spanning finance, law and hospitality sectors, (ii) there was no match for a job e.g. &apos;prostitute&apos; and &apos;translator&apos;, <lb/>(iii) the jobs were inherently gendered e.g. &apos;waitress&apos; and &apos;salesman&apos;. There are two further considerations in matching. First, <lb/>when a GPT-2 job is less general than the US categories. For example, while GPT-2 gave separate predictions for taxi drivers <lb/>and chauffeurs, the US data only reports &apos;taxi drivers and chauffeurs&apos;. Similarly, while GPT-2 gives separate predictions for <lb/>maids, housekeepers and cleaners, the US category amalgamates these into &apos;maids and housekeeping cleaners&apos;. For these <lb/>cases, we average across GPT-2&apos;s predictions for the relevant jobs, i.e. combining the predictions for maid, housekeeper and <lb/>cleaner. Second, when GPT-2&apos;s predictions are more general than the US categories. For example, when GPT-2 returns the <lb/>token of &apos;teacher&apos; but the US data reports &apos;postsecondary teachers, &apos;preschool and kindergarten teachers&apos;, etc. For these <lb/>cases, we sum across the US sub-categories. Tab. 9 gives details on these matches. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">D. Regression Analysis <lb/>D.1. Percentage of Significant Coefficients <lb/>Tab. 10 shows the percentage of significant coefficients for each intersection. To produce these results, we run regressions <lb/>for all jobs mentioned more times than the same threshold values used in the paper. Each regression includes all main effects <lb/>and interaction terms. We then compute the percentage of significant coefficients for each term across all regressions with <lb/>baseline man as the reference group. We repeat these steps for each intersection: ethnicity, religion, sexuality and political <lb/>affiliation. We did not run regression for continent name origin because there was no suitable baseline category given every <lb/>first name has geographic and gender associations. <lb/>Considering religion, the Buddhist term has the higher percentage significance across all regressions (78%), while the <lb/>Hindu term has the lowest (55%). This supports the findings in the paper that some religions are stronger determinants <lb/>of jobs than others. Of the interaction terms, woman:buddhist is the least significant (19%). This finding suggests that <lb/>male jobs are more highly determined by Buddhist membership, but female jobs are less strongly associated with this <lb/>affiliation. Considering ethnicity, the Hispanic term is most commonly significant (64%), while the Asian term is less <lb/>commonly significant (42%). The interactions for Hispanic and Black women are more frequently significant than those <lb/>for White and Asian women. This finding suggests some ethnicity-gender pairs more saliently affect GPT-2&apos;s priors on <lb/>job associations. Considering sexuality, both sexuality categories (gay/straight) are significant in approximately 50% of <lb/>regressions. A woman&apos;s intersectional association with being lesbian is more commonly significant than an association with <lb/>being straight. Considering political affiliation, the liberal term is more commonly significant than the conservative term, <lb/>and the same pattern apply to gender-political interaction terms. <lb/>Finally, we can compare the average significance of categories, gender and their intersections across religion, ethnicity, <lb/>sexuality and political regressions. Religion main effects are on average significant in 66% of regressions, ethnicity main <lb/>effects in 53% of regressions, sexuality main effects in 48% of regressions and political main effects in 60% of regressions. <lb/>This suggests for men, there is higher across-religion variation in predicted jobs than say for across-sexuality variation. <lb/>The woman dummy is significant in 61% of religion regressions, in 71% of ethnicity regressions, in 61% of sexuality <lb/>regressions and in 59% of political regressions. This finding demonstrates the woman and man variation is more influential <lb/>in distinguishing between job affiliations for ethnicity and least influential for political affiliation. Across all regressions, the <lb/>woman dummy is highly significant suggesting gender is an important determinant of job predictions. Finally, the interaction <lb/>terms are significant in 26% of religion regressions, in 30% of ethnicity regressions, in 31% of sexuality regressions and in <lb/>27% of political regressions. This suggests for women, sexuality and ethnicity are stronger determinants of job associations. <lb/>Interaction terms are significant in approximately one-third of regressions, while the woman dummy is significant in <lb/>approximately two-thirds of regressions. This finding suggests, while intersectionality is an relevant determinant of predicted <lb/>job, gender more strongly influences GPT-2&apos;s priors over occupational associations. <lb/>Table 10.

			<div type="annex">D.2. All Regression Results <lb/>Fig. 12 presents the significant p-values in all regressions for main effects and interaction terms. Significant p-values <lb/>(p &lt; 0.05) are shaded in black, while non-significant terms are left as white. Considering for example ethnicity, there are <lb/>two axes of variation. First, some jobs have significant p-values across all terms such as supervisor and teacher, indicating <lb/>these jobs are highly segmented by gender and by ethnicity, but also by their interaction. Jobs with no significant p-values <lb/>represents cases where the model did not converge which occurred when there was insufficient variation across different <lb/>demographics. In Fig. 13, we present the direction and magnitude of significant coefficients. Any negative coefficients, <lb/>i.e. those that make the job prediction less likely, are shaded in red. Any positive coefficients, i.e. those that make the <lb/>job association more likely, are shaded in blue. Any insignificant coefficients (p &gt; 0.05) are left as white. A darker color <lb/>indicates a larger strength of coefficient. We present all the results so an interested reader can select a certain job and find <lb/>the associated coefficients for gender and intersections, alongside their interaction terms. <lb/>Finally, Fig. 14 presents the change in Pseudo-R 2 for all job regressions across ethnicity when the woman dummy is added <lb/>and when the interaction terms are added. To produce these results, we first run a regression with all the main effects of <lb/>categorical membership e.g. (&apos;Asian&apos;, &apos;Black&apos;, &apos;Hispanic&apos;, &apos;White&apos;) but without the woman dummy. Given baseline &apos;man&apos; <lb/>is the reference group, all gender variation resides in the intercept. Next, we re-add the woman dummy, and observe how <lb/>the model fit improves. Finally, we run a regression with all main effects and all interaction terms and see what additional <lb/>variation is explained. The general pattern observed is that the woman dummy has a greater effect on the model fit than the <lb/>interactions. This finding suggests that while interaction terms for intersectional associations are significant in approximately <lb/>one-third of job regressions, they explain a lower proportion of variation than gender.

The proportion of White workers is less accurately predicted but the same pattern is observed <lb/>towards under-predicting the proportion of women in female dominated jobs and over-predicting the proportion of women <lb/>in male-dominated jobs. <lb/>asian_W <lb/>asian_M <lb/>black_W <lb/>black_M <lb/>hispanic_W <lb/>hispanic_M <lb/>white_W <lb/>white_M <lb/>mechanic <lb/>plumber <lb/>carpenter <lb/>construction worker / laborer <lb/>truck driver <lb/>taxi driver / chaffeur / driver <lb/>police officer <lb/>computer programmer <lb/>courier <lb/>guard / security guard / bouncer <lb/>chef <lb/>barber <lb/>lawyer <lb/>janitor <lb/>manager <lb/>doctor <lb/>cook <lb/>reporter / journalist <lb/>bus driver <lb/>salesperson <lb/>photographer <lb/>bartender <lb/>barista <lb/>writer <lb/>model <lb/>teacher <lb/>social worker <lb/>nurse <lb/>cleaner / housekeeper / maid <lb/>receptionist <lb/>secretary / assistant <lb/>babysitter <lb/>0.18 2.4 0.76 4 <lb/>1.5 -12 1.3 10 <lb/>-0.02 8.8 -0.23 8.5 -0.73 -25 -2.4 17 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>3 <lb/>2.6 <lb/>5 <lb/>4.2 -24 18 -17 <lb/>0.92 1.1 1.3 3.2 3.3 -26 4.3 0.05 <lb/>-0.19 2.3 -1.2 -3.9 4.6 3.3 -5 -11 <lb/>-0.07 -5.2 -2 -15 0.67 -5.2 8.2 0.94 <lb/>-0.02 2.4 1.9 7.3 -1.7 -5.8 8.8 4.2 <lb/>-4.2 -8.8 -1.7 1.6 -1.8 12 -14 35 <lb/>2.5 5.3 -3.6 -0.24 -3.8 -15 -12 24 <lb/>-0.34 0.2 -3.5 -4.1 -2.1 -4.8 0.21 25 <lb/>-0.19 -7.6 1 -5.4 0.24 -12 18 3.6 <lb/>-0.55 1.2 -4.4 -7.8 -4.7 -16 0.39 41 <lb/>0.12 -0.87 3.4 3.5 4.5 <lb/>6 <lb/>3.5 7.5 <lb/>0.45 1.2 -2.6 -3.1 -4.5 -4.2 -1.2 3 <lb/>0.49 1.3 0.58 0.54 3 <lb/>7 -7.2 -7.3 <lb/>-5.4 -6.5 0.82 3.5 2.9 3.7 -0.16 27 <lb/>1.3 -0.31 -1.1 -5.3 -6 -14 12 -8.1 <lb/>-1.4 -2.4 5.7 4.8 -2.9 -4.4 12 <lb/>24 <lb/>1.5 3.3 -5.3 -7 3.1 2.2 -28 -7.1 <lb/>0.54 2.5 -1.8 -2.6 1.1 8.2 -18 -6.3 <lb/>-0.26 4.3 4.1 6.1 -6.1 -6.2 11 <lb/>10 <lb/>-0.26 0.89 2.7 <lb/>8 -1.5 5 <lb/>-16 <lb/>9 <lb/>0.59 2.3 0.25 0.6 -3.1 4.3 -13 -8 <lb/>2.7 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>3.1 -1.7 -1.8 -13 20 <lb/>4.3 -0.28 5.6 -3 -2.5 -3.5 21 -21 <lb/>0.28 0.67 1 0.56 2.1 <lb/>2 -4.9 8.4 <lb/>2.6 -0.67 -8.2 -3.6 4.8 3.4 1.4 -13 <lb/>-4 -0.47 -1.3 0.71 10 2.2 -0.28 1.5 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>3 -6.8 1.9 -34 0.33 -28 7.5 <lb/>0.05 1.2 -7.7 0.44 -1.6 6.6 -21 5.1 <lb/>0.77 1.3 -0.01 1.5 -4.5 3.6 -11 42 <lb/>-3.1 -0.22 -3.8 -1.1 2.8 -1.6 25 <lb/>-5 <lb/>GPT &lt; True <lb/>GPT &gt; True <lb/>30 <lb/>20 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>Figure 24.
