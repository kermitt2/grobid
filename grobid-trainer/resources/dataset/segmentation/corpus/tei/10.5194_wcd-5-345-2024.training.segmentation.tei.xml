Rising seas are a threat to human and natural systems along coastlines. The relation between global <lb/>warming and sea level rise is established, but the quantification of impacts of historical sea level rise on a <lb/>global scale is largely absent. To foster such quantification, here we present a reconstruction of historical hourly <lb/>(1979-2015) and monthly (1900-2015) coastal water levels and a corresponding counterfactual without long-<lb/>term trends in sea level. The dataset pair allows for impact attribution studies that quantify the contribution of <lb/>sea level rise to observed changes in coastal systems following the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on <lb/>Climate Change (IPCC). Impacts are ultimately caused by water levels that are relative to the local land height, <lb/>which makes the inclusion of vertical land motion a necessary step. Also, many impacts are driven by sub-daily <lb/>extreme water levels. To capture these aspects, the factual data combine reconstructed geocentric sea level on <lb/>a monthly timescale since 1900, vertical land motion since 1900 and hourly storm-tide variations since 1979. <lb/>The inclusion of observation-based vertical land motion brings the trends of the combined dataset closer to tide <lb/>gauge records in most cases, but outliers remain. Daily maximum water levels get in closer agreement with tide <lb/>gauges through the inclusion of intra-annual ocean density variations. The counterfactual data are derived from <lb/>the factual data through subtraction of the quadratic trend. The dataset is made available openly through the <lb/>Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) at https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.749905 (Treu <lb/>et al., 2023a). <lb/>Published by Copernicus Publications. <lb/></front>

    <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Sea level rise is a threat to a significant proportion of <lb/>the world&apos;s population, which is concentrated near the sea. <lb/>Global sea levels rose by 15 to 25 cm from 1901 to 2018 <lb/>and are expected to rise by a further 28 (lower bound of the <lb/>SSP-1.9 scenario) to 101 cm (upper bound of the SSP-8.5 <lb/>scenario) relative to the period 1995-2014 by 2100 (Fox-<lb/>Kemper et al., 2021). There are still gaps in the understand-<lb/>ing of fast Antarctic ice loss, which may lead to sea level rise <lb/>above the upper bound of the SSP-8.5 scenario. The trend <lb/>in relative sea level (RSL) rise is stated as a climate impact <lb/>driver (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) for seven of the eight Repre-<lb/>sentative Key Risks identified in the Working Group II con-<lb/>tribution to the sixth assessment report of the Intergovern-<lb/>mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, AR6, WGII, Chap-<lb/>ter 16; O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a). It contributes in particular as a <lb/>driver of risks to low-lying coastal socio-ecological systems <lb/>through irreversible long-term loss of land, critical ecosys-<lb/>tem services, livelihoods, wellbeing or culture in combina-<lb/>tion with other drivers of risk. <lb/>Several studies assessed the future coastal risks from sea <lb/>level rise and incorporated important drivers such as socio-<lb/>economic development and population change (Hallegatte et <lb/>al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2014; Neumann et al., 2015; Hunter <lb/>et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2018; Tiggeloven et al., 2020; <lb/>Vousdoukas et al., 2020; Kirezci et al., 2023). There is, how-<lb/>ever, an absence of works on observed impacts attributed to <lb/>sea level rise, though similar modeling approaches could be <lb/>used. In particular, there is a lack of studies to attribute his-<lb/>torical coastal change or disturbances to sea level rise in a <lb/>global setting (O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a). <lb/>Studies on a regional scale exist. They attributed changes <lb/>in the physical quantities of historic flood events, e.g., for <lb/>Hurricane Katrina (Irish et al., 2014) and Hurricane Sandy <lb/>(Lin et al., 2016), coastal retreat to sea level rise in Senegal <lb/>(Enríquez-de-Salamanca, 2020) and Pakistan (Kanwal et al., <lb/>2020), abrupt beach retreat in Tasmania to sea level rise and <lb/>wind changes (Sharples et al., 2020). Strauss et al. (2021) <lb/>quantified the role of historical sea level rise in economic <lb/>damages for the individual event of Hurricane Sandy. Ob-<lb/>served damages in Solomon Islands and Fiji have been as-<lb/>sessed to be driven by relative sea level rise (Albert et al., <lb/>2016; McNamara and Des Combes, 2015). These examples <lb/>are taken from the literature review on impact attribution for <lb/>the IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 16 (O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a); see <lb/>O&apos;Neill et al. (2022b) for a comprehensive overview of stud-<lb/>ies 1 . <lb/>Challenges for studies on impact attribution to sea level <lb/>rise include the sparse observational data on flood extent re-<lb/>quired to validate historical impact simulations on the global <lb/></body>

    <body>scale, with improvements becoming available only recently, <lb/>e.g., through the Global Flood Database (Tellman et al., <lb/>2021) and the Flood Inundation Archive (Yang et al., 2021) <lb/>for flooded coastal areas. Few datasets exist for longer-term <lb/>change of coastlines (Mentaschi et al., 2018; Luijendijk et <lb/>al., 2018). Global digital elevation datasets are another im-<lb/>portant source of uncertainty as their vertical precision is <lb/>largely below that of historical sea level change (e.g., Van <lb/>de Sande et al., 2012; Gesch, 2018), but there are promising <lb/>recent advances (Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021; Vernimmen <lb/>and Hooijer, 2023). There is, however, also a lack of forcing <lb/>data to facilitate impact attribution to sea level rise. <lb/>With this study we aim to address the lack of forcing data <lb/>and facilitate works that quantify the role of sea level rise <lb/>in historically observed phenomena at the coast. Such phe-<lb/>nomena can be slowly evolving changes like the retreat of <lb/>sandy beaches or extreme-event-driven effects like economic <lb/>damages from coastal flooding. Here we build on the impact <lb/>attribution framework outlined in the IPCC AR6 WG2, ch16 <lb/>(O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a). The IPCC defines an &quot;observed im-<lb/>pact as the difference between the observed state of a natural, <lb/>human or managed system and a counterfactual baseline that <lb/>characterizes the system&apos;s state in the absence of changes in <lb/>the climate-related systems&quot; and further that the &quot;difference <lb/>between the observed and the counterfactual baseline state <lb/>is considered the change in the natural, human or managed <lb/>system that is attributed to the changes in the climate-related <lb/>systems (impact attribution)&quot; (O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a). <lb/>As the counterfactual impact baseline cannot be observed, <lb/>it needs to be modeled by an impact model. A precondition <lb/>for impact attribution is that the impact model explains the <lb/>observed phenomenon under consideration reasonably well <lb/>given its drivers. This necessitates a model evaluation step, <lb/>which is followed by the attribution step itself. The presented <lb/>work aims to make forcing data available for both steps: <lb/>(i) factual forcing data to evaluate impact models and pro-<lb/>duce factual historical impact simulations and (ii) counter-<lb/>factual forcing data to produce counterfactual impact simu-<lb/>lations. <lb/>While the factual data should stay as close as possible to <lb/>reality and are thus in principle set, the counterfactual data <lb/>depend on the specific attribution question. As coastal sys-<lb/>tems changed fast over the past century, with climate and <lb/>sea level presumably two drivers but often not the dominant <lb/>ones, here we ask the following attribution question: &quot;how <lb/>did historical sea level rise affect observed phenomena in dy-<lb/>namic coastal systems with a multitude of drivers, irrespec-<lb/>tive of the origin of the sea level rise?&quot; We thus aim to de-<lb/>lineate sea level rise from other drivers of change like pop-<lb/>ulation change, construction activity at the coast or ecosys-<lb/>tem degradation through direct human intervention. We do <lb/>not focus on the causes of sea level rise itself but treat it as <lb/>one driver of coastal change or disturbance in line with the <lb/>IPCC definition (O&apos;Neill et al., 2022a).

    <body>would need investigation of the causal chain from emissions <lb/>to sea level rise to impacts through a more complex attribu-<lb/>tion setup based on climate model ensembles (Hope et al., <lb/>2022). <lb/>Coastal systems ultimately experience the change of the <lb/>water level at the coast relative to the height of the land, <lb/>which we term relative water levels. As relative water lev-<lb/>els are the most direct input for impact models, we provide <lb/>factual and counterfactual relative water levels. This neces-<lb/>sitates the inclusion of vertical land motion (VLM), which -<lb/>though an important driver of coastal impacts -has been less <lb/>rigorously observed and researched on a global level than sea <lb/>level, and global datasets have only recently become avail-<lb/>able (Oelsmann et al., 2024; Hammond et al., 2021; Fred-<lb/>erikse et al., 2020; Hawkins et al., 2019b; Pfeffer et al., <lb/>2017). Consistent with the impact attribution definition of <lb/>the IPCC, we do not investigate the drivers of VLM itself <lb/>but treat it as a driver of impacts as a part of the relative sea <lb/>level. There is no predecessor for a global relative water level <lb/>dataset. <lb/>We construct relative hourly and extended monthly coastal <lb/>water levels globally for the historical period and a respective <lb/>counterfactual -the hourly coastal water levels with counter-<lb/>factual (HCC) dataset. We describe the approach in the &quot;Ma-<lb/>terials and methods&quot; section, present the main features of the <lb/>dataset in the subsequent &quot;Results&quot; section, and provide a <lb/>discussion in the final section. <lb/>2 Materials and methods <lb/>Many impacts manifest through extreme sea level condi-<lb/>tions that occur on the timescale of hours, which necessi-<lb/>tates a product that resolves these timescales. The construc-<lb/>tion of factual relative hourly coastal water levels in our HCC <lb/>dataset can be broken down into the sum of four components: <lb/>h = h LF + h HF + h T + h SC , <lb/>(1) <lb/>where h is the water level relative to the coast, h LF is a low-<lb/>frequency component that includes the long-term evolution <lb/>of water levels and VLM, h HF is a high-frequency compo-<lb/>nent that describes hourly changes in water levels, h T is the <lb/>tidal component, and h SC is the regular seasonal cycle. We <lb/>derive them as follows: <lb/>-h LF (low frequency). This was derived from a geocen-<lb/>tric, deseasonalized version of the hybrid reconstruc-<lb/>tion (HR) dataset from Dangendorf et al. (2019) and <lb/>a probabilistic VLM reconstruction from Oelsmann et <lb/>al. (2024). This combined dataset is low-pass-filtered by <lb/>taking its 90 d running mean value to retain only contri-<lb/>butions with frequency longer than 3 months. To yield <lb/>hourly resolution, the result is interpolated with cubic <lb/>spline interpolation. <lb/>-h HF (high frequency). This was sourced from desea-<lb/>sonalized non-tidal residuals of the Coastal Dataset for <lb/>the Evaluation of Climate impact (CoDEC; Muis et al., <lb/>2020) to cover the high-frequency variation of storm <lb/>tides. This is then high-pass-filtered by removing the <lb/>90 d running mean value, to represent water level fre-<lb/>quencies higher than 3 months. <lb/>-h T (tidal levels). This was derived from the tidal com-<lb/>ponent of CoDEC. <lb/>-h SC (seasonal cycle). This denotes the multiyear sea-<lb/>sonality computed over the years 1993 to 2015 from <lb/>the satellite altimetry dataset used in Dangendorf et <lb/>al. (2019). To yield hourly resolution, the seasonal cycle <lb/>is interpolated with cubic spline interpolation. <lb/>To ensure no overlap, the regular seasonal cycle is excluded <lb/>from both h LF and h HF components. Barotropic water level <lb/>changes due to wind and atmospheric pressure on timescales <lb/>longer than or equal to 1 month are covered in both the <lb/>HR and the CoDEC dataset. We use frequency filtering to <lb/>prevent double counting. CoDEC models these water level <lb/>changes explicitly, whereas HR is based on a statistical re-<lb/>construction method based on sparse observations. However, <lb/>HR is not restricted to barotropic variations alone and covers <lb/>the full spectrum of intra-annual and longer sea level varia-<lb/>tions (including sterodynamic and barystatic processes). The <lb/>dominating process at different timescales depends on lo-<lb/>cal conditions (Zhu et al., 2021; Dangendorf et al., 2014). <lb/>We thus expect that it depends on the location which prod-<lb/>uct performs better. Our method&apos;s cutoff frequency deter-<lb/>mines which scale of variations is captured by each product. <lb/>CoDEC captures variations with higher frequencies than the <lb/>cutoff, while HR captures variations with lower frequencies. <lb/>We have tested for different cutoff frequencies and how it <lb/>affects the performance of the combined product when com-<lb/>pared to tide gauges. We varied the cutoff frequency for val-<lb/>ues of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months and found an optimal <lb/>cutoff frequency of 3 months (90 d). <lb/>We apply the same process but exclude the VLM re-<lb/>construction to yield a geocentric version of the combined <lb/>dataset. To yield a common vertical reference, we shift the <lb/>geocentric version of our dataset vertically to yield instan-<lb/>taneous height above the WGS 84 geoid, which is also <lb/>called absolute dynamic topography. To that end, we re-<lb/>move the mean value for the time period 1993-2012 from <lb/>our geocentric dataset and add the mean dynamic topogra-<lb/>phy from Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Ser-<lb/>vice (CMEMS) SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_MDT_008_063 <lb/>https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00150 (E.U. Copernicus Ma-<lb/>rine Service Information (CMEMS), 2024) that is derived <lb/>from satellite altimetry over the same time period. We align <lb/>our relative version of the dataset with the geocentric version <lb/>such that the water levels in both datasets are equal on the <lb/>last date of the record. <lb/>We describe in Sect. 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 the different source <lb/>datasets and how we adjusted them for this application. <lb/></body>

    <body>We describe how we derived the counterfactual dataset in <lb/>Sect. 2.5, &quot;Counterfactual water levels&quot;. <lb/>2.1 Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate impact <lb/>(CoDEC) <lb/>CoDEC is an update of the Global Tide and Surge Reanaly-<lb/>sis (GTSR; Muis et al., 2016) dataset and uses a newer mod-<lb/>eling framework, with higher-resolution and newer climate <lb/>forcing data. It is based on the hydrodynamic Global Tide <lb/>and Surge Model (GTSMv3.0), which uses the unstructured <lb/>Delft3D Flexible Mesh software (Kernkamp et al., 2011) as <lb/>the shallow-water flow solver and resolves coastal areas at <lb/>high detail while being efficiently coarse in the open ocean. <lb/>GTSM uses the depth-averaged, barotropic mode of Delft3D, <lb/>assuming a constant density of ocean waters. It explicitly <lb/>models tides and storm surges at a high temporal resolution. <lb/>The model has global coverage and thus no open boundaries. <lb/>The coastal resolution is 1.25 km at European coasts and <lb/>2.5 km at other global coasts. To produce CoDEC, GTSM <lb/>is forced with the 10 m wind speed and atmospheric pressure <lb/>from the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2020). ERA5 de-<lb/>termines the time coverage of CoDEC from 1979 to 2017. <lb/>The spatial resolution of ERA5 is 0.25°× 0.25°(∼ 31 km). <lb/>Time series are saved at approximately 18 000 output loca-<lb/>tions that are located at 10-50 km distance along a smoothed <lb/>global coastline. Validation by Muis et al. (2020) has demon-<lb/>strated that CoDEC has an average root mean squared error <lb/>(RMSE) of 0.26 m (SD 0.73 m) for the comparison between <lb/>modeled and observed annual maxima at 485 tide gauge sta-<lb/>tions in the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis database <lb/>(GESLA-2; Woodworth et al., 2016). For tropical cyclones <lb/>with wind fields of relatively small spatial extent, extreme <lb/>water levels are expected to be underestimated due to poor <lb/>representation of the meteorological forcing in ERA5 (Dul-<lb/>laart et al., 2020). Polar regions are not well resolved due <lb/>to low-quality atmospheric forcing, poor bathymetry and the <lb/>poor representation of ice dynamics. <lb/>For the HCC dataset we separate the total CoDEC water <lb/>levels into components of tidal elevation and non-tidal storm <lb/>surge residuals. We deseasonalize the storm surge residuals <lb/>by removing the monthly average climatology over the years <lb/>1993-2015, which is interpolated to hourly resolution with <lb/>cubic spline interpolation. <lb/>2.2 The hybrid reconstruction (HR) dataset <lb/>The HR dataset (Dangendorf et al., 2019) combines two <lb/>methodologies to reconstruct historical sea level rise from <lb/>tide gauge and satellite observations. Both methodologies are <lb/>prominent sea level reconstruction approaches on their own <lb/>(Church et al., 2011; Hay et al., 2015) and have their distinct <lb/>advantages and shortcomings. HR applies each methodology <lb/>at timescales where they have well-proven performance. The <lb/>HR dataset covers the period 1900-2015 and has monthly <lb/>time resolution. Thus it cannot provide sea level variability <lb/>on timescales shorter than months, which needs to be intro-<lb/>duced by CoDEC. Since HR is based on observations, the <lb/>data include all sea level processes that are not explicitly re-<lb/>moved. Most importantly, it includes the effects of gravita-<lb/>tion, rotation and deformation of the Earth accompanying the <lb/>sea level change from mass addition through melting glaciers <lb/>and ice sheets, changes due to density variations of the ocean <lb/>water and dynamic ocean currents, and variations induced by <lb/>the inverse barometer effect. By construction, HR includes <lb/>the sea level variability from wind and atmospheric pressure <lb/>changes, which are also represented in the CoDEC dataset. <lb/>Note that modulations due to the nodal cycle driven by the <lb/>varying declination of the moon in time are not explicitly <lb/>modeled within the HR framework. <lb/>We remove VLM contributions from HR to represent the <lb/>evolution of water levels relative to the geoid (geocentric). <lb/>HR contains VLM from long-term glacial isostatic adjust-<lb/>ment (GIA) since the glacial maximum 21 000 years ago <lb/>and from short-term crustal responses to present-day ice melt <lb/>since 1900 (Pfeffer et al., 2017; Spada, 2017; Riva et al., <lb/>2017). GIA is explicitly modeled in HR and can thus be read-<lb/>ily taken out. The crustal responses to present-day ice melt <lb/>are implicitly contained in HR through cryostatic fingerprints <lb/>that are fitted to tide gauges. We use the annual reconstruc-<lb/>tions of the crustal responses to present-day ice melt from <lb/>glaciers and the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice <lb/>sheet from Frederikse et al. (2020) to remove this contribu-<lb/>tion. For the HCC dataset we deseasonalize the geocentric <lb/>version of HR by removing the monthly average climatology <lb/>over the years 1993-2015. <lb/>2.3 Vertical land motion dataset <lb/>We use VLM data from Oelsmann et al. (2024) that provide <lb/>a probabilistic annual VLM reconstruction from 1995-2020 <lb/>based on more than 10 000 time series from global naviga-<lb/>tion satellite system (GNSS) stations and differences of al-<lb/>timetry and tide gauge observations. Their approach incor-<lb/>porates long-term secular VLM based on present-day obser-<lb/>vations of the combined effects of GIA and various other <lb/>VLM processes. In regions that are dominated by GIA, such <lb/>as the Baltic Sea and the NE-US coast, the trends of the <lb/>VLM reconstruction align well with a GIA model by Caron <lb/>et al. (2018) (as can be seen in Fig. 3c in Oelsmann et al., <lb/>2024). They explicitly account for a linear trend component <lb/>and non-linear variations with time. Oelsmann et al. (2024) <lb/>adapt methods so far used for the reconstruction of abso-<lb/>lute sea level changes (e.g., Church and White, 2011) us-<lb/>ing empirical orthogonal functions. The spatiotemporal vari-<lb/>ations are interpolated along the world&apos;s coastlines using <lb/>adaptive Bayesian transdimensional processes (Hawkins et <lb/>al., 2019a). By accounting for the non-linear components of <lb/>the temporal evolution, the estimated linear trends over the <lb/>last century (1900-2000) are expected to be more robust. The <lb/></body>

    <body>non-linear components capture, for example, the present-day <lb/>effects (since 1995) of earthquakes, which can introduce ex-<lb/>treme variations in observed VLM trends up to centimeters <lb/>per year or instantaneous displacements with a magnitude <lb/>of several centimeters to meters. For this study, we derive <lb/>VLM from 1900-2015 by interpolating the annual VLM re-<lb/>constructions linearly to a monthly scale and extrapolate it <lb/>back to the year 1900 with the reconstruction of the linear <lb/>component of VLM. <lb/>We incorporated this VLM dataset, which is directly de-<lb/>rived from observations, as the most independent source for <lb/>such data. Alternatives to this approach exist and have al-<lb/>ready been used in earlier datasets. One possibility is to only <lb/>account for VLM that is caused by GIA which can directly be <lb/>modeled or implicitly through cryostatic fingerprints in the <lb/>case of responses to present-day ice melt (Dangendorf et al., <lb/>2019). Another possibility is to approximate non-linear ef-<lb/>fects from the residual between tide gauge observations and <lb/>reconstructions (Hay et al., 2015; Kopp et al., 2014; Dangen-<lb/>dorf et al., 2021), which can be valuable to extend observa-<lb/>tions in time when no GNSS data are available. This residual <lb/>approach depends on long tide gauge records which have an <lb/>uneven and sparse global coverage and is thus not fully suit-<lb/>able to generate a densely interpolated coastal estimate. <lb/>2.4 Tide gauge datasets <lb/>We use two different tide gauge datasets to evaluate the HCC <lb/>dataset. To evaluate long-term sea level change, we use the <lb/>tide gauge measurements of monthly mean sea level from <lb/>the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL, 2022; <lb/>Holgate et al., 2013). We restrict our analysis to 663 PSMSL <lb/>records of at least 20 years&apos; length and with at least 30 % <lb/>data coverage in the 1993-2012 period. To align PSMSL <lb/>with HCC or HR we remove the 1993-2012 average from <lb/>each of those datasets respectively. We specifically calculate <lb/>the average only over all time steps where the associated ob-<lb/>servational record has valid data. This reduces the alignment <lb/>error between the observations and modeled data. <lb/>To evaluate the higher frequencies shorter than a month we <lb/>use the tide gauge data provided by the GESLA-3 database <lb/>(Woodworth et al., 2016; Haigh et al., 2022a, b, 2023; Cald-<lb/>well et al., 2015), which is provided on an hourly or sub-<lb/>hourly sampling frequency. We aggregated all records with <lb/>higher sampling frequency to hourly resolution by taking the <lb/>average over all time samples that fall within plus or minus <lb/>30 min of a specific hour. We use GESLA-3 records to eval-<lb/>uate the HCC dataset at daily maximum water levels and to <lb/>assess the 99th percentile of the storm surge residual. Both <lb/>analyses have slightly different requirements for the data <lb/>availability. For the first analysis we use daily maximum wa-<lb/>ter levels, which are detrended by removing their respective <lb/>annual mean value. Here we only include years in the calcu-<lb/>lation that have at least 11 months of valid data. For compara-<lb/>bility between stations, we require at least 30 % of valid years <lb/>between 1979 and 2015. Observations and modeled data are <lb/>aligned by the annual detrending, and thus no further vertical <lb/>alignment is necessary. With these restrictions we use 1040 <lb/>tide gauge records from GESLA-3 for this analysis. <lb/>The second analysis is based on storm surge time series <lb/>from GESLA-3. To remove the tidal contribution we esti-<lb/>mate tides for the observations by fitting harmonic functions <lb/>with 69 harmonic components as described by Annunziato <lb/>and Probst (2016). To preserve variability with frequencies <lb/>that are larger than or equal to 1 month, we predict harmonic <lb/>tides based on fitted parameters for 65 sub-monthly harmonic <lb/>components only, leaving out 4 components with frequencies <lb/>larger than or equal to 1 month. We then remove the predicted <lb/>harmonic tides from the observations. <lb/>We evaluate the performance of HCC on the 99th per-<lb/>centile of daily maxima storm surge in the 2011-2015 pe-<lb/>riod. To that end, we vertically align the observational and <lb/>factual datasets by removing their respective mean value for <lb/>time steps with valid observations in this period. We require <lb/>at least 90 % data coverage in this period. With these restric-<lb/>tions we use 999 tide gauge records from GESLA-3 for this <lb/>analysis. In Text S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplement, we per-<lb/>form a statistical test on how sensitive the vertical alignment <lb/>is on different percentages of data coverage in the alignment <lb/>period. <lb/>The tide gauge stations used in this study are illustrated <lb/>in Fig. 1, with colors referring to ocean basins following the <lb/>definition of Thompson and Merrifield (2014). <lb/>2.5 Counterfactual water levels <lb/>We generate counterfactual water levels that exclude the <lb/>trends since the beginning of the 20th century but preserve <lb/>the short-term sea level variability of the factual dataset. <lb/>There is increased evidence for an acceleration in global sea <lb/>level rise (Church and White, 2011; Hay et al., 2015; Fred-<lb/>erikse et al., 2020; Dangendorf et al., 2017, 2019). To ac-<lb/>count for the accelerated trend in sea level rise, we employ <lb/>a quadratic trend model. For each location, we estimate this <lb/>trend using linear regression on the annual mean time series, <lb/>setting the intercept to the average sea level from 1900-1905. <lb/>After removing this long-term trend, we obtain the counter-<lb/>factual time series. We evaluate the robustness of this trend <lb/>estimate using the moving block bootstrapping algorithm, as <lb/>described by Mudelsee (2019). We find that the total sea <lb/>level rise derived from the trend estimate varies depending <lb/>on the location, with standard deviations ranging from 3.4 to <lb/>16.7 mm and an average standard deviation of 8.1 mm (See <lb/>supplement Text S2 and Fig. S2). While uncertainties exist, <lb/>this demonstrates that the quadratic model provides a robust <lb/>representation of the long-term trend in sea level rise. Im-<lb/>portantly, the uncertainty associated with our model is rela-<lb/>tively small when compared to the uncertainties in the factual <lb/>dataset itself. <lb/></body>

The respective ocean basins are shown as <lb/>colored areas. Map adapted from Thompson and Merrifield (2014) with an additional division of the North Atlantic into West and East and <lb/>are extended by nearest-neighbor interpolation. <lb/>As the water height relative to the coast is needed as in-<lb/>put for impact models, the factual/counterfactual pair can be <lb/>used as forcing in such models directly. We additionally pro-<lb/>vide a counterfactual of the geocentric version of the factual <lb/>dataset excluding the effects of VLM. The geocentric factu-<lb/>al/counterfactual pair can be used if it is known from other <lb/>sources that VLM is negligible or if better VLM estimates <lb/>are available regionally. To yield a counterfactual consistent <lb/>with our approach, the VLM quadratic trend since 1900-<lb/>1905 would need to be estimated from the regional VLM <lb/>data and then subtracted from the geocentric counterfactual <lb/>dataset. <lb/>3 Results <lb/>We provide the factual and counterfactual datasets with <lb/>hourly resolution for the time period 1979-2015 and monthly <lb/>resolution for the time period 1900-2015. <lb/>3.1 Long-term sea level trends <lb/>We evaluate the performance of our dataset by comparing it <lb/>to tide gauge measurements from the PSMSL database. In <lb/>the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section we describe in more de-<lb/>tail how we select tide gauge measurements from PSMSL <lb/>and how we align it with the HCC and HR datasets. To vi-<lb/>sualize long-term sea level change we plot the linear trend <lb/>from the tide gauge records and the modeled coastal wa-<lb/>ter levels respectively for years with valid observations. Our <lb/>dataset reflects the different trends in different world re-<lb/>gions well (Fig. 2a) and shows a comparable RMSE against <lb/>observations. Figure 2b shows the RMSE of the monthly <lb/>HCC dataset and the HR dataset against observations. Fig-<lb/>ure 2c depicts latitudes for all tide gauge stations from the <lb/>PSMSL record that were used to analyze monthly water lev-<lb/>els, aligned by ocean basins. <lb/>We evaluate the performance of the HCC dataset through <lb/>its RMSE against observations and compare it to the perfor-<lb/>mance of the HR dataset (Table 1). The HCC dataset shows <lb/>a median RMSE of 5.43 cm (SD 5.34 cm) over all tide gauge <lb/>stations, which is an improvement compared to the HR, with <lb/>a median RMSE of 5.69 cm (SD 6.00 cm). We performed a <lb/>Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the RMSE samples <lb/>and found that the improvement is statistically significant, <lb/>with a p value of 5.36 × 10 -10 . However, the improvement <lb/>of 0.26 cm is only modest when compared to the total er-<lb/>ror magnitudes. The improvement occurs in all seven basins <lb/>and is pronounced in the Subtropical North Atlantic, with <lb/>a median RMSE of 4.55 cm (SD 2.79 cm) as compared to <lb/>5.45 cm (SD 6.2 cm) in HR. Figure 2b provides more de-<lb/>tail, showing RMSE per tide gauge. In the higher latitudes <lb/>of the East Pacific, our dataset has a lower RMSE than HR <lb/>for most stations (Fig. 2b). The performance also decreases <lb/>at tide gauges in the lower northern latitudes of the East Pa-<lb/>cific. As these regions are all located at plate boundaries and <lb/>are thus highly prone to tectonically induced VLM, this may <lb/>hint at problems in the extrapolation back in time to 1900 <lb/>from recent VLM data for such regions. However, in sum-<lb/>mary, for all locations we see the inclusion of observational <lb/>VLM and its backward extrapolation superior to approaches <lb/>that only include the GIA component of VLM and neglect <lb/>other contributing processes, as can be seen in the overall <lb/>improvement of median RMSE. <lb/>3.2 Intra-annual variability <lb/>To evaluate our dataset on timescales shorter than a year, we <lb/>compare it with observations from the GESLA-3 database. <lb/>For illustration, in Fig. 3 we first show daily mean values for <lb/></body>

For the example of Stockholm, Sweden, the den-<lb/>sity variations modulating sea level during the annual cycle <lb/>as present in HR bring the atmospheric wind-and pressure-<lb/>driven variability from CoDEC significantly closer to obser-<lb/>vations and thus improve the performance in our combined <lb/>dataset. A similar effect is evident for Toyama, Japan, and <lb/>Miami, USA. Notably, also after including HR, the HCC wa-<lb/>ter levels do not perfectly match the observations. Discrep-<lb/>ancies remain, e.g., in Miami, USA, between October and <lb/>November 2001. However this falls well within the uncer-<lb/>tainty margins of the HR dataset, given that it represents a <lb/>global statistical reconstruction of water levels. For the sta-<lb/>tions of Zanzibar, Tanzania, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, sea <lb/>level variation of HR is low as compared to the total sea level <lb/>amplitude; thus the factual dataset and CoDEC evolve sim-<lb/>ilarly, and an improvement is not evident. Both stations are <lb/>located in areas that are barely covered by tide gauges used <lb/>in HR. <lb/>We assess if improvements are visible over all tide gauges <lb/>in Fig. 4. We compare coastal water levels from our dataset, <lb/>CoDEC and HR through their respective RMSE against <lb/>tide gauge observations. Following Muis et al. (2020), each <lb/>dataset is detrended by subtracting the annual mean from <lb/>each time series and each year respectively. This means that <lb/>a performance improvement is due to better alignment of <lb/>intra-annual variability with tide gauges as inter-annual mean <lb/>sea level change is explicitly excluded. For most locations <lb/>the RMSE against tide gauge observations from GESLA-3 <lb/>is lower for our detrended monthly dataset than for HR, vi-<lb/>sualized by blue bars in Fig. 4a. The global median RMSE <lb/>of our dataset is 3.35 cm (SD 2.60 cm) compared to 3.71 cm <lb/>(SD 2.55 cm) for the HR dataset. The improvement is consis-<lb/>tent over all basins except for the Northwest Pacific, where <lb/>the median RMSE for our dataset of 3.59 cm (SD 1.82 cm) is <lb/>slightly higher than for HR with 3.47 cm (SD 1.87 cm) (Ta-<lb/>ble 1). The improved performance of our dataset is stronger <lb/>in midlatitudes to higher latitudes of the North Atlantic and <lb/>some stations in the East Pacific. In the East Pacific and <lb/>Indian Ocean-South Pacific, there is a mixed picture, with <lb/>some stations showing a lower performance than HR (green <lb/>bars Fig. 4a). Wind-driven and air-pressure-driven barotropic <lb/>sea level variability is more pronounced in midlatitudes to <lb/>higher latitudes (Merrifield et al., 2013), which might explain <lb/>the improved performance of our dataset in these regions <lb/>since it uses sea level variability from CoDEC on a timescale <lb/>up to 3 months. This is plausible as wind-driven variabil-<lb/>ity and air-pressure-driven sea level variability are explicitly <lb/>modeled in CoDEC and only interpolated from sparse obser-<lb/>vations in HR. Daily maximum water levels in our dataset <lb/>have a global median RMSE of 12.02 cm (SD 22.15 cm), <lb/></body>

This improvement is evident for <lb/>almost all stations, as illustrated by the blue bars in Fig. 4b. <lb/>The largest performance increases are in the Northwest Pa-<lb/>cific where our dataset has a median RMSE of 8.11 cm (SD <lb/>9.77 cm) compared to 10.93 cm (SD 9.13 cm) for CoDEC <lb/>and is almost halved to values as low as 50 mm for some <lb/>stations (Fig. 4b). The more important role of ocean den-<lb/>sity variations as compared to wind-driven and air-pressure-<lb/>driven variability is a plausible explanation for the stronger <lb/>increase in performance in the lower latitudes. Density varia-<lb/>tions are captured in our dataset through the inclusion of HR <lb/>and the seasonal cycle from AVISO. <lb/>3.3 Extreme water levels <lb/>To illustrate the role of the long-term trend in sea level ex-<lb/>tremes, we investigate extreme water levels in our factual and <lb/>counterfactual dataset and compare them to tide gauge ob-<lb/>servations from GESLA-3. We only consider extreme events <lb/>from 2011-2015 because this period is covered well in the <lb/>observations, and sea level rise is close to its maximum. We <lb/>restrict our analysis of extreme water levels to tide gauge <lb/>stations with at least 90 % of data in the considered period <lb/>which leaves a total of 999 stations. As astronomical tides in-<lb/>troduce a strong offset in extreme water levels and thus make <lb/>the comparison between different locations difficult, here we <lb/>remove astronomical tides from the modeled and observed <lb/>water levels and focus on the surge component. As coasts are <lb/>historically adapted to their tides, extreme surges are an im-<lb/>portant cause for extreme impact events and their damages. <lb/>We therefore analyze the 99th percentile of daily maximum <lb/>surge levels. To that end, we pick the 1 % highest daily max-<lb/>imum surge levels from the observational data in the years <lb/>2011-2015 and compare those to our factual and counter-<lb/>factual dataset. We focus solely on sea level anomalies, to <lb/>level out differences in surge height between different sta-<lb/>tions, caused by permanent differences to the geoid. We cal-<lb/>culate sea level anomalies for tide gauge records by remov-<lb/>ing the mean sea level over time steps with valid observations <lb/>in the period 2011-2015. To reduce the alignment error, we <lb/>calculate the mean sea level for the factual dataset only for <lb/>time steps with valid observations in the tide gauge record. <lb/>From that we derive sea level anomalies for the factual and <lb/>counterfactual by removing the factual mean sea level from <lb/>both datasets. This maintains the difference between the fac-<lb/>tual and counterfactual datasets resulting from long-term sea <lb/>level rise. <lb/>We show these top 1 % highest water levels for our fac-<lb/>tual and counterfactual dataset and the tide gauge obser-<lb/></body>

We show daily mean values for the year 2001 that are vertically aligned by removing the respective annual <lb/>mean sea level. <lb/>vations in Fig. 5a. In general, there is a good agreement <lb/>between modeled extreme water levels (blue bars) and ob-<lb/>servations (black markers). However, our dataset underesti-<lb/>mates the extreme water levels at most locations, with a me-<lb/>dian bias of -12.78 cm (SD 22.22 cm). This underestima-<lb/>tion is pronounced for the East Pacific with -18.22 cm (SD <lb/>20.07 cm) and Subpolar North Atlantic West with -15.03 cm <lb/>(SD 24.51 cm) (Table 1). There is a known low bias in the <lb/>model, in particular for the highest water levels originating <lb/>from the CoDEC dataset. It is largely attributed to the spatial <lb/>resolution of the atmospheric inputs (Muis et al., 2020). <lb/>By design, the counterfactual dataset preserves the daily, <lb/>monthly and inter-annual variability of the factual dataset. <lb/>Extreme sea level events have the same timing in the coun-<lb/>terfactual and the factual. We can thus pick the timings of the <lb/>1 % highest water levels from the factual dataset and assess <lb/>the events in the counterfactual dataset in Fig. 5a. The trend <lb/>in relative coastal water levels increased extreme water lev-<lb/>els for almost all world regions with the counterfactual lying <lb/>below the factual for most tide gauge locations. In particular, <lb/>for regions with low surge magnitudes, it often contributes <lb/>a significant fraction to the extreme event. The situation is <lb/>different for the high northern latitudes where counterfactual <lb/>sea level rise is above the factual. In these regions the extreme <lb/>event magnitude is reduced, primarily due to the influence of <lb/>GIA (Emery and Aubrey, 1985). In some regions the coun-<lb/>terfactual is below zero. These are regions where the highest <lb/>surge levels are close to the mean sea level from 2011-2015. <lb/>With the factual not much higher than zero, the counterfac-<lb/>tual without the sea level trend since 1900 easily falls below <lb/>zero. <lb/></body>

Copernicus <lb/>Marine Service Information (CMEMS), 2024). <lb/>5 Code availability <lb/>Data and code used to produce the table and figures pre-<lb/>sented in this study, based on v1.2 of the source code, are <lb/>archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10354898 (Treu <lb/>et al., 2023b). <lb/>6 Discussion <lb/>In this work, we combine datasets of long-term sea level <lb/>change, short-term coastal water level variability and VLM <lb/>to yield a forcing dataset for historical simulations with <lb/>coastal impact models. To facilitate the attribution of histori-<lb/>cal impacts to sea level rise, we complement the dataset with <lb/>a counterfactual. <lb/>The task poses several challenges. A major one is the in-<lb/>clusion of VLM to yield relative coastal water levels. Given <lb/>the sparsity of direct observational data, particularly prior to <lb/>the 1990s, extrapolating VLM back to the early 20th century <lb/>makes our estimates error prone, and anthropogenic influ-<lb/>ence post-WWII adds additional difficulties. It is difficult to <lb/>exclude anthropogenic influences like fluid extraction from <lb/>the trend estimation. Further advances in this field should be <lb/>incorporated in future sea level assessments. By providing a <lb/>geocentric version of the HCC dataset, it is possible to com-<lb/>bine our water levels with other reconstructions of VLM. <lb/>Another challenge originates from the different nature of <lb/>the source datasets that we combine. HR and the VLM data <lb/>are built from observations; thus they include all contribut-<lb/>ing processes, but there are limits for the disentanglement <lb/>of components in these datasets. CoDEC is a simulation-<lb/>based dataset in which the individual components are avail-<lb/>able, but CoDEC does not capture all processes. We avoid <lb/>double counting atmospherically driven barotropic sea level <lb/>changes by frequency filtering, which affects all processes. <lb/>The choice of a specific cutoff frequency is a trade-off as <lb/>it means that processes with higher frequencies come from <lb/>the CoDEC dataset without coverage of density-driven sea <lb/>level variability. Partly, we can account for that by fre-<lb/>quency filtering only deseasonalized data and adding the sea-<lb/>sonal cycle from AVISO satellite altimetry. For processes <lb/>with lower frequencies than the cutoff, sea level variability <lb/></body>

    <body>comes from HR which covers density-driven variability but <lb/>is for many regions not as good at covering atmospherically <lb/>driven variability as CoDEC. Future work could explore us-<lb/>ing region-specific cutoff frequencies to better harness the <lb/>individual strengths of HR and CoDEC. This approach, how-<lb/>ever, would necessitate a comprehensive analysis of the dom-<lb/>inant timescales of variability within each dataset for differ-<lb/>ent regions. <lb/>HR does not cover regions with sea ice because there is <lb/>no continuous coverage of altimetry for those regions. Our <lb/>coastal water levels in those regions are based on extrapola-<lb/>tion of HR and need to be used with extreme care. We pro-<lb/>vide a mask along with the dataset so users can exclude sea <lb/>ice areas. For some of these regions, namely for Greenland, <lb/>Siberia and Antarctica, VLM data are also absent (Oelsmann <lb/>et al., 2024). <lb/>To derive a counterfactual dataset in line with the concept <lb/>of impact attribution of the IPCC, we use a quadratic model <lb/>to first estimate and then remove the sea level trend since <lb/>1900 from the factual dataset. The quadratic model assumes <lb/>a constant acceleration of sea level rise over time. Analy-<lb/>sis of sea level rise shows variation throughout the last cen-<lb/>tury, with an acceleration phase early in the century, followed <lb/>by a deceleration and then again an acceleration until today <lb/>(Frederikse et al., 2020; Dangendorf et al., 2019; Slangen et <lb/>al., 2016). By design, this variation is not included in our <lb/>quadratic trend estimate. In general, we expect our trend es-<lb/>timation to largely exclude natural variability due to its low <lb/>dimension and the long data period. This is a desired out-<lb/>come and preserves the natural variability in the counterfac-<lb/>tual. The quadratic model provides robust trend estimates, <lb/>given the fact that we do not extrapolate the trend into the fu-<lb/>ture, which would increase uncertainties. To further increase <lb/>the robustness of the trend estimate, future studies should in-<lb/>clude predictors for the main modes of climate variability as, <lb/>for example, in Menéndez and Woodworth (2010), Marcos <lb/>and Woodworth (2017), and Wang et al. (2021). <lb/>In contrast to atmospheric climate change, there is no pre-<lb/>industrial period in which sea level was stable over time. <lb/>There is therefore not a clear indication for the time pe-<lb/>riod that we can reference as the baseline for the counterfac-<lb/>tual. Here we took the practical choice of making the years <lb/>1900-1905 the reference time because this is when the HR <lb/>dataset starts. In a strict sense, with the counterfactual forc-<lb/>ing data, we thus mimic a sea level world of the beginning <lb/>of the 20th century and not a world in which sea level rise <lb/>has not occurred. The approach produces counterfactuals that <lb/>are largely stationary but incorporates the same shorter-term <lb/>variability as the factual dataset. The data thus also allow <lb/>for impact attribution of individual coastal extreme events. <lb/>For an extended discussion of the concept, see Mengel et <lb/>al. (2021). <lb/>Without additional analysis, the presented work does not <lb/>allow for the attribution of coastal impacts to anthropogenic <lb/>greenhouse gas emissions, mediated through sea level rise. <lb/>Such additional steps would need the differentiation between <lb/>climate variability and forced climate response. This is usu-<lb/>ally done via large model ensembles and dedicated experi-<lb/>mental setups like DAMIP (Gillett et al., 2016). While at-<lb/>tribution of global mean sea level change to anthropogenic <lb/>emissions is possible (e.g., Slangen et al., 2016), the task of <lb/>separating variability from the forced signal is more chal-<lb/>lenging on the regional level that is necessary for impact as-<lb/>sessments and not yet possible over the 20th century (Fox-<lb/>Kemper et al., 2021). Here we deliberately exclude the sep-<lb/>aration of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic forcing of <lb/>sea level rise as it often becomes the focus of impact attri-<lb/>bution studies and sidelines the more difficult and less re-<lb/>searched but, in our view, very relevant issue of separation <lb/>of climate change from direct human interventions as drivers <lb/>of observed changes in natural, human and managed systems. <lb/>Additionally, large Earth system model ensembles that would <lb/>allow for the attribution to emissions but also reliably capture <lb/>all major sea level components are not available so far. <lb/>We provide the factual and counterfactual dataset as part <lb/>of the ISIMIP3a simulation round. This simulation round is <lb/>dedicated to the evaluation of impact models and to impact <lb/>attribution. ISIMIP already provides datasets on some addi-<lb/>tional drivers of coastal impacts, such as change in popula-<lb/>tion, land use, economy or urban area 2 . With the presented <lb/>data, we aim to facilitate the development of a new gen-<lb/>eration of coastal impact models that explicitly resolve the <lb/>observed spatial and temporal coastal changes and distur-<lb/>bances. <lb/></body>
