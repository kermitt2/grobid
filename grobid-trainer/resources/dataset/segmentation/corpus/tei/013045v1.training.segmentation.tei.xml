			<front>Abstract <lb/>Genome wide association studies provide an unbiased discovery mechanism for <lb/>numerous human diseases. However, a frustration in the analysis of GWAS is that <lb/>the majority of variants discovered do not directly alter protein-coding genes. <lb/>We have developed a simple analysis approach that detects the tissue-specific <lb/>regulatory component of a set of GWAS SNPs by identifying enrichment of <lb/>overlap with DNase I hotspots from diverse tissue samples. Functional element <lb/>Overlap analysis of the Results of GWAS Experiments (FORGE) is available as a <lb/>web tool and as standalone software and provides tabular and graphical <lb/>summaries of the enrichments. Conducting FORGE analysis on SNP sets for 260 <lb/>phenotypes available from the GWAS catalogue reveals numerous overlap <lb/>enrichments with tissue-specific components reflecting the known aetiology of <lb/>the phenotypes as well as revealing other unforeseen tissue involvements that <lb/>may lead to mechanistic insights for disease. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>Genome Wide Association; GWAS; Hypersensitive sites; Regulatory Elements. <lb/></front>

			<body>Identifying Regulatory Components of Genome Wide Association Study Hit <lb/>Lists <lb/>A primary motivation for sequencing the human genome was to shed light on <lb/>mechanisms involved in human disease. Since finishing the sequence there has <lb/>been much activity in two areas towards that goal. In the first, extensive re-<lb/>sequencing of individual genomes has provided comprehensive lists of human <lb/>variations, which can in turn be examined for association with disease and other <lb/>phenotypes in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) [1]. In the second area, <lb/>efforts have been undertaken to identify the specific sequences that enact <lb/>function within the genome including, but not restricted to, regions defining <lb/>genes and their controlling elements [2-4]. The aim, of course, is to understand <lb/>the associations uncovered in the first approach in the context of the annotations <lb/>delivered from the second. <lb/>The past few years have seen a dramatic growth in the number of variants <lb/>associated with disease by GWAS [1]. An extensive catalogue of GWAS <lb/>associations has been compiled containing nearly 14,000 associations of variants <lb/>to phenotypes [5]. However, a crucial observation is that the majority of the <lb/>variants observed do not directly affect the coding regions of protein coding <lb/>genes. Notwithstanding that the reported variant for an association may be in <lb/>linkage disequilibrium with a causal variant affecting a protein coding sequence, <lb/>regulatory regions have been demonstrated to be linked to both specific diseases <lb/>associations [6-18] (see [19] for review and further examples) and to be <lb/>enriched in bulk in SNPs found across all GWAS [2, 20-22]. The ENCODE <lb/>consortium reported that GWAS single nucleotide variants are substantially <lb/>enriched in regulatory regions and up to 80% of GWAS variants have a potential <lb/>regulatory interpretation via overlap with regulatory annotation [2, 21, 22]. <lb/>Furthermore, Maurano et al [21] showed that regulatory regions revealed by the <lb/>DNase-seq method show a cell specific enrichment for GWAS variants in specific <lb/>phenotypes consistent with probable physiological mechanisms. Trynka et al <lb/>[23] similarly found that regulatory elements identified by the histone <lb/>modification H3K4me3 show a phenotypically relevant cell specific overlap with <lb/>GWAS SNPs. Several tools exist to highlight the specific overlaps of individual <lb/>GWAS SNPs with potential regulatory regions [24, 25]. To date however, much of <lb/>the focus on this work has been on prioritising variants, rather than exploring <lb/>the extensive cell type information present in the large-scale projects. <lb/>We have developed a simple but powerful approach that identifies significant <lb/>cell specific enrichments in regulatory regions for sets of single nucleotide <lb/>variants, typically from GWAS. We name the approach Functional element <lb/>Overlap analysis of the Results of GWAS Experiments or FORGE, and have <lb/>implemented it as both a rapid web tool for ENCODE[26] and Roadmap <lb/>Epigenome project DNase-seq data[27] and a free-standing open source <lb/>software. The web tool produces two alternative graphical outputs for <lb/>exploration alongside tabulated enrichment data. FORGE analysis across all <lb/>eligible phenotypes in the entire GWAS catalog [5] identifies numerous <lb/>interesting patterns of enrichment by cell type and suggests tissues to focus on <lb/>for future follow up studies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Forge Analysis approach <lb/>FORGE analysis provides a method to view the tissue specific regulatory <lb/>component of a set of variants. In its current implementation, FORGE analysis <lb/>takes a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as those <lb/>SNPs reported above the genome wide significance threshold (p &lt; 5e-8) in a <lb/>GWAS study, optionally filters the SNPs to remove all bar one SNP from a region <lb/>in high LD (&quot;LD pruning&quot;) and determines whether there is enrichment for <lb/>overlap with putative regulatory elements compared to a matched background <lb/>of SNP sets. Initially the elements considered are DNase I hotspots generated <lb/>from either the ENCODE [26] or Roadmap Epigenomics projects DNase I data by <lb/>the Hotspot method [28, 29], because of both the comprehensiveness of the sites <lb/>identified and the broad range of cell types for which DNase I data was available. <lb/>DNase I hotspots can be regarded as regions of general DNase I sensitivity. <lb/>For each set of test SNPs, an overlap analysis is performed against the DNase I <lb/>hotspots for each available cell sample separately (125 samples for ENCODE, 299 <lb/>for Roadmap, described in Supplementary Table S1), and the number of overlaps <lb/>is counted. Major potential confounders in this analysis are the many biases of <lb/>GWAS SNP distribution on the genome. To account for this a background <lb/>distribution of the expected overlap counts for this SNP set is obtained by <lb/>identifying 1000 matched background SNP sets of the same number of SNPs, <lb/>matching each test SNP with an equivalent SNP by decile bin for each of G+C <lb/>content (GC), minor allele frequency (maf) and distance to the nearest <lb/>transcription start site (TSS). The matched background SNPs sets are overlapped <lb/>with the DNase I hotspots and the background distribution of overlap counts is <lb/>determined. The enrichment of the test SNP set for each sample is expressed as <lb/>the binomial P value of the test SNP set given the background overlap <lb/>distribution. The FORGE results are presented in interactive and static graphical <lb/>and tabular forms by cell type. Enrichments above the background distribution <lb/>with binomial P values less than 0.01 corrected for multiple testing <lb/>are considered significant and are highlighted in red in the graphical output. <lb/>Enrichments with p &lt;= 0.05 are also highlighted in pink (Figure 1). As the DNase <lb/>I patterns are not independent between cell types, we conducted simulation <lb/>experiments with randomly selected input SNPs. We chose 1000 random test <lb/>SNP sets for each of a series of SNP counts ranging between 5 and 100 SNPs and <lb/>conducted FORGE analysis on both ENCODE and Roadmap data. The false <lb/>positive rate was determined as the number of cell type enrichments identified <lb/>greater than the significance thresholds used by FORGE expressed as the <lb/>proportion of the total number of sample overlap tests performed (424,000) for <lb/>each SNP count. This analysis showed that the P value thresholds are reasonably <lb/>well calibrated to false positive levels around 0.5-0.75 %. In practice we correct <lb/>the thresholds further for multiple testing across different tissues so as to be <lb/>more stringent and so expect typical false positive levels to be less. As discussed <lb/>below, many of the GWAS SNP sets do not reveal any enrichment, consistent with <lb/>low false positive rates. <lb/></body>

			<body>The FORGE tool <lb/>We have implemented FORGE as a web tool available at <lb/>http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/UserData/Forge. The <lb/>interface accepts a list of SNPs by dbSNP RefSNP identifier (RSID) or by genomic <lb/>location on human genome build GRCh37 in either Variant Call Format (VCF, <lb/>http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-<lb/>variant-call-format-version-41) or Bed format (Personal Genome SNP format, <lb/>http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format10), and allows <lb/>specification of the background selection from two common sets of GWAS SNP <lb/>typing microarrays. LD filtering is achieved at either r <lb/>2 &gt;= 0.8 or r 2 &gt;= 0.1 using <lb/>1000 genomes project population data. The outputs of the analysis are an <lb/>interactive graphic for exploration of the analysis, a static pdf for printing or <lb/>publication (Figure 1), and a table of enrichments in either an interactive or <lb/>standard tab separated format. <lb/>In addition the code is available to download from <lb/>https://github.com/iandunham/Forge, with the required database files available <lb/>at ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/browser/forge. Installed <lb/>on a Macbook Pro with core i7 processor, 16Gb RAM and a solid state hard drive, <lb/>a typical FORGE analysis of a set of 55 SNPs with 1000 background tests is <lb/>accomplished in around 30s, and in 35s with LD filtering. <lb/>Gallery of Examples <lb/>We ran FORGE analysis on 260 phenotypes in the NCBI GWAS catalog NCBI <lb/>GWAS catalog [5, 30] with a reported associated SNP count of 5 or more after LD <lb/>pruning (see Supplementary Table S2 for list of phenotypes analysed and <lb/>references) at genome-wide significance. Complete tables of results for all SNP <lb/>sets analysed are included in the data directory of the Github release, <lb/>https://github.com/iandunham/Forge. 35 and 60 out of 260 SNP sets had at <lb/>least one significant enrichment at the P value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 after <lb/>correction for multiple testing, respectively (Table 1). A set of example positive <lb/>outputs from this analysis is available from <lb/>http://www.1000genomes.org/forge-gwas-catalog-example-gallery11 (PDF <lb/>format). Removing SNPs that directly alter a protein coding exon from the GWAS <lb/>catalog sets did not substantively alter the patterns of enrichments (data not <lb/>shown). <lb/>Figure 1 shows a series of example FORGE analyses for autoimmune disease <lb/>studies on the Roadmap Epigenome samples (references for the studies are <lb/>provided in Supplementary Table S2). In each case there is a clear signal for <lb/>enrichment of overlap with DNase I hotspots in the blood-derived samples <lb/>including cells of immune function. In more detail, for those phenotypes where <lb/>there is involvement of T cell activation or invasion in the aetiology (e.g. Crohn&apos;s <lb/>disease, Multiple Sclerosis) there is enrichment in the CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive <lb/>samples containing T cells as well as enrichment in the CD56 positive sample <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>including NK cells. In addition, these disease SNPs overlap with hotspots present <lb/>in the fetal thymus samples, consistent with the location of T cells maturation. <lb/>Further signals specific to the individual aetiologies are also identified. Crohn&apos;s <lb/>disease SNPs show enrichment of overlap with hotspots in the fetal small and <lb/>large intestine samples, as well as fibroblasts and skin cells. For inflammatory <lb/>bowel disease SNPs there is a much more general enrichment, in addition to the <lb/>specific immune cells, which may be consistent with the more generalized <lb/>inflammation. In contrast, for autoimmune diseases where the primary <lb/>involvement is a B cell response (Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Systemic lupus <lb/>erythematosus (SLE)), the most pronounced overlap enrichment is in CD19 <lb/>positive samples characteristic of B cell activation or circulating plasma cells. In <lb/>rheumatoid arthritis there is also some overlap enrichment for samples <lb/>characteristic of T cells and thymocytes, but it is relatively less, and this is much <lb/>less pronounced for SLE. Thus, FORGE analysis reveals tissue specific <lb/>enrichment of overlap for GWAS SNPs with regulatory regions indicative of <lb/>known tissue involvement in the disease aetiology. <lb/>The tissue specific enrichment of overlap is not specific to just autoimmune <lb/>disease (see results gallery at http://www.1000genomes.org/forge-gwas-<lb/>catalog-example-gallery11). For instance, for QRS duration the GWAS associated <lb/>SNPs are strongly enriched for overlap with fetal heart samples. GWAS SNPs <lb/>associated with pulmonary function measured by spirometry are enriched for <lb/>overlap with hotspots in fetal lung cells and lung cell lines. For red blood cell <lb/>traits and platelet count the major overlap enrichment signal is in CD34 positive <lb/>hematopoietic progenitor cells consistent with their role in both red blood cell <lb/>and platelet development. In contrast for GWAS SNPs involved in height, the <lb/>overlap enrichment is not tissue specific but is more general over many tissues <lb/>and cell lines. There are further examples displayed in the results gallery at <lb/>http://www.1000genomes.org/forge-gwas-catalog-example-gallery11, in most <lb/>case consistent with expected disease aetiologies. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>FORGE (Functional element Overlap analysis of the Results of GWAS <lb/>Experiments) analysis is a straightforward and fast method to examine sets of <lb/>nucleotide variants, typically identified in GWAS studies, for tissue specific <lb/>regulatory signals. It presents a graphical overview of overlap enrichment with <lb/>DNase I hotspots that quickly provides evidence of a regulatory component to <lb/>SNPs associated with a phenotype, and highlights potentially mechanistically <lb/>relevant cells or tissues. A typical usage scenario would be to analyse a set of <lb/>GWAS SNPs identified above genome wide significance to reveal the regulatory <lb/>component of the association. Furthermore the cell or tissue enrichments might <lb/>be consistent with prior expectation of the disease aetiology providing additional <lb/>confidence in the SNP set identified, or might provide new insights as to <lb/>potential sites of disease mechanism. <lb/>The statistical approach we used here relies on the careful matching of <lb/>background behaviour of SNPs with calibrations by randomization for the per <lb/>cell type enrichment. The underlying biases of GWAS SNP distributions with <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>respect to TSS distance, maf and GC are not easy to model parametrically. <lb/>However other approaches which would make assumptions of homogeneity <lb/>(such as the Poisson distribution) or of regional heterogeneity (Genome <lb/>Structure Correction, [31]) would not be able to capture these known biases. It <lb/>is important to note that as alternate SNP resources are utilized in GWAS, the <lb/>appropriate background SNPs must be used for control. For instance a switch to <lb/>genotyping by genome sequencing or extensive use of imputation requires <lb/>revision of the background. New and updated background sets can be <lb/>implemented as required in particular for genome sequencing GWAS approaches <lb/>and higher density genotyping arrays. <lb/>Not all GWAS study SNP sets downloaded from the GWAS catalog showed <lb/>overlap enrichment with the DNase I hotspots. In these cases all sample points <lb/>were above the P value thresholds (blue points). This could occur because there <lb/>is no regulatory component underlying the GWAS association in these <lb/>phenotypes, because the associated SNPs do not contain mechanistically causal <lb/>SNPs, because the relevant tissue is not present in the available DNase I datasets <lb/>or because of low power in the GWAS study to detect regulatory effects. As <lb/>further data sets are release by the ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenome and other <lb/>projects these can be incorporated into the database to provide coverage of <lb/>further cell types. In addition the approach could be readily extended to other <lb/>data types including regions of specific histone modification as used by Trynka et <lb/>al [23] or relevant transcription factor binding regions. <lb/>60 out of 260 sets of GWAS SNPs from the GWAS catalog for specific phenotypes <lb/>had overlap enrichments detected in at least one DNase I hotspot sample (Table <lb/>1). As described above in several cases, the patterns of tissue-specific <lb/>enrichment are highly evocative of the known aetiologies of the phenotypes, but <lb/>can also reveal additional tissue involvements that require further investigation. <lb/>We encourage interested parties to peruse the gallery of results for their own <lb/>phenotypes, as well as running new SNP sets discovered in GWAS either through <lb/>the web interface or with the standalone software. <lb/>Methods <lb/>DNase I Data <lb/>ENCODE consortium hotspots [26] were obtained from <lb/>ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/b <lb/>yDataType/openchrom/jan2011/combined_hotspots/. Roadmap Epigenome <lb/>DNAse1 sequencing tag alignments were obtained <lb/>from http://www.genboree.org/EdaccData/Current-Release/experiment-<lb/>sample/Chromatin_Accessibility/. The files used correspond to that part of the <lb/>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE18927 beyond the data use <lb/>embargo date. These alignments were processed by the Hotspot <lb/>(http://www.uwencode.org/proj/hotspot/) [28, 29] method with the default <lb/>parameters to give hotspot and peak files. For this analysis we choose to use the <lb/></body>

			<body>hotspots which are regions of general DNase I sensitivity rather than peaks <lb/>which are more similar to DNase I hypersensitive sites because, although the <lb/>method works with peaks, hotspots reveal more tissue specific signal (data not <lb/>shown). Cell and tissue assignments for each of the data sets were made using <lb/>the decodings available from the ENCODE Data Coordination Center tables <lb/>(https://genome.ucsc.edu/encode/cellTypes.html) or from the BioSamples <lb/>database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) sampleGroup SAMEG31306. A list <lb/>of samples used is provided in Supplementary Table S1. <lb/>GWAS SNP data <lb/>The complete collection of SNPs discovered in GWAS studies curated in the <lb/>NHGRI GWAS Catalog [5] were downloaded from <lb/>http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/ [30](Accessed 3rd September 2014). <lb/>SNPs were grouped according to the annotation provided in the Disease/Trait <lb/>field and only sets with 5 or more non-redundant SNPs were retained. See <lb/>Supplementary Table S2 for list of SNP sets analysed. A set of files of the SNPs <lb/>included in analysis for each phenotype is available in the data directory of the <lb/>GitHub release, https://github.com/iandunham/Forge. For Forge analysis SNP <lb/>sets were further filtered by LD pruning removing all but one SNP from a set of <lb/>SNPs at r 2 &gt;= 0.8 in the 1000 genomes data (see below) and were analysed for <lb/>both ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome DNase I hotspots, selecting background <lb/>SNP sets from the default GWAS genotyping array SNPs. <lb/>Preparation of FORGE overlaps <lb/>The FORGE tool utilises either an SQLite (command line tool, <lb/>http://www.sqlite.org) or MySQL (web tool, http://www.mysql.com) database <lb/>of the overlaps of every 1000 genomes project (http://www.1000genomes.org) <lb/>[32] SNP with the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap DNase1 hotspots. To <lb/>prepare this database, SNPs from the 1000 genomes phase 1 integrated call data <lb/>set were downloaded from <lb/>ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_c <lb/>all_sets and compared to indexed DNase I hotspots using tabix from the <lb/>SAMtools package (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml) [33] using a <lb/>distributed approach on the EBI compute farm. The overlaps for each SNP were <lb/>stored in a single large indexed table of SNP location and identifier with binary <lb/>strings representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of overlap in each sample <lb/>for each of the hotspot data sets (ENCODE or Roadmap). <lb/>Background SNP parameters <lb/>To prepare sets of background SNPs matched to the test SNP set, FORGE matches <lb/>SNPs based on GC, maf and TSS distance, and repeats the overlap analysis for <lb/>each of 1000 background sets. Overall population mafs were obtained from the <lb/>1000 genomes project phase 1 integrated call data set at <lb/>ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_c <lb/></body>

			<body>all_sets. To control for the processes involved in selecting SNPs for genotyping, <lb/>only 1000 genomes phase 1 SNPs that had been included on one of the common <lb/>genotyping platforms as described in Ensembl <lb/>(http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/data_description.html#variat <lb/>ion_sets) were considered further. This left either 1875813 SNPs across various <lb/>platforms (Affy GeneChip 100K Array, Affy GeneChip 500K Array Affy SNP6, <lb/>HumanCNV370-Quadv3, HumanHap300v2, HumanHap550v3.0, Illumina Cardio <lb/>Metabo, Illumina Human1M-duoV3, Illumina Human660W-quad) or 2231212 <lb/>SNPs across the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 array. TSS distance was determined for <lb/>each remaining SNP relative to the TSS defined by the Gencode project [34, 35] <lb/>given in <lb/>ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDat <lb/>aType/gencode/jan2011/Gencodev7_CAGE_TSS_clusters_June2011.gff.gz using <lb/>Bedops closest-features [36]. GC was determined for a 100 bp window centred <lb/>on the SNP at base 50. The SNPs were then sorted into 1000 bins partitioned by <lb/>deciles for each of GC, maf and TSS. For each SNP in a test set, the corresponding <lb/>bin is identified based on its GC, maf and TSS distance, and background <lb/>selections are made from that bin. <lb/>FORGE analysis <lb/>A set of SNPs can be presented to FORGE as a list of RSIDs or by genome location <lb/>on human genome build GRCh37 in either VCF or Bed formats. If RSIDs are not <lb/>provided in one of these formats, the genome coordinates are used to identify <lb/>the RSID. SNPs not present in the 1000 genomes phase 1 integrated call data set <lb/>are excluded from the analysis. With LD pruning selected a single SNP (the first <lb/>in the file) is chosen from LD clusters within either r <lb/>2 &gt;= 0.8 or r 2 &gt;= 0.1 as <lb/>specified. For each analyzable SNP in the test set, overlaps are retrieved from the <lb/>FORGE database, and a count of total hotspot overlaps is recorded for each <lb/>DNase I sample (cell) for the test SNP set. One hundred matching background <lb/>SNP sets containing the same number of SNPs as the test SNP set are selected, <lb/>matched for GC, maf and TSS distance by decile bins as described above. <lb/>Overlaps for each of the SNPs in each of the background SNP sets are also <lb/>retrieved from the database and an overlap count for each background set in <lb/>each DNase I sample is recorded. For each test SNP set, the background <lb/>probability of overlap is determined from the 1000 background set overlap <lb/>counts and the probability of the observed test result under a binomial <lb/>distribution is calculated. The P value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 are corrected <lb/>for multiple testing by division by the number of tissue groupings tested, and the <lb/>corrected threshold is used. The use of tissue as the unit for sample grouping is <lb/>consistent with the groupings obtained by hierarchical clustering of samples by <lb/>Dnase 1 data (results not shown). The corrected thresholds are therefore more <lb/>stringent than established by the random trials. <lb/>FORGE outputs <lb/>FORGE generates both tabular and graphic descriptions of the enrichment of <lb/></body>

			<body>overlap for the test SNPs for each DNase I hotspot sample. A tab-separated <lb/>values (TSV) file is output including columns for the binomial P value, cell, tissue, <lb/>filename of the sample hotspots, SNPs that contribute to the enrichment, and the <lb/>GEO accession for each sample. This data is also provided as an interactive table <lb/>produced using the Datatables (https://datatables.net/) plug-in for the jQuery <lb/>Javascript library accessed through the rCharts package <lb/>(http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/). <lb/>Each of the graphic outputs presents the -log10 binomial p by cell sample. A pdf <lb/>graphic is generated using base R graphics (http://www.r-project.org ). The <lb/>interactive Javascript graphic is generated using the rCharts package <lb/>(http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/) to interface with the dimple d3 libraries <lb/>(http://dimplejs.org). In both cases cells are grouped alphabetically by tissue, <lb/>and for the pdf alphabetically by cell. The interactive graphic stacks replicate <lb/>samples at the same x coordinate. In each of the graphics the colouring of results <lb/>by P value is consistent, blue (p &gt; 0.05 equivalent after correction), pink (0.05 =&gt; <lb/>p &lt; 0.01), and red (p &lt;= 0.01). The corrected P value threshold is given on the pdf <lb/>output. <lb/>False positive rates <lb/>To estimate false positive rates, 1000 sets of SNPs at each of a series of SNP <lb/>counts between 5 and 300 SNPs were randomly chosen from the 1000 genome <lb/>phase 1 integrated SNP set. FORGE analysis was run for each set across the <lb/>ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome data, and the number of tests with P values <lb/>less than thresholds ranging from 0.05 to 0.001 were recorded. These represent <lb/>the false positives from 1000 trials at each of 424 samples i.e. 424,000 tests, and <lb/>were used to calculate false positive rates at each significance threshold. <lb/>Hierarchical Clustering of DNase I samples <lb/>The hierarchical clustering solution was obtained using a multi-scale bootstrap <lb/>resampling approach. We first computed a binary regulatory signature for each <lb/>cell type classifying each DNase I site as active or inactive in each cell type <lb/>sample. Hierarchically clustering of the binary regulatory signatures was by <lb/>Euclidean distance with Ward&apos;s agglomerative method using the pvclust R/CRAN <lb/>package with default values (http://cran.r-<lb/>project.org/web/packages/pvclust/index.html). Finally, we identified clusters <lb/>supported by the data at a bootstrap probability p value &lt; 0.01. <lb/></body>
