How-<lb/>ever, it is rarely considered in a holistic view, considering local resources, agro-environmen-<lb/>tal effects and harmonization with farmers&apos; needs. Organic inputs, like compost and biochar, <lb/>could represent a sustainable solution to massive current challenges associated to the inten-<lb/>sification of agriculture, in particular for tropical regions. Here we assess the potential of agri-<lb/>cultural residues as a resource for farmer communities in southwestern India to reduce their <lb/>dependency on external inputs and sustain ecosystem services. We propose a novel joint <lb/>evaluation of farmers&apos; aspirations together with agro-environmental effects of organic inputs <lb/>on soils. Our soil quality evaluation showed that biochar alone or with compost did not <lb/>improve unilaterally soils in the tropics (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol). Many organic <lb/>inputs led to an initial decrease in water-holding capacities of control soils (-27.3%: coconut <lb/>shell biochar with compost on Anthroposol). Responses to organic matter inputs for carbon <lb/>were strongest for Ferralsols (+33.4% with rice husk biochar), and mostly positive for Anthro-<lb/>posols and Vertisols (+12.5% to +13.8% respectively). Soil pH responses were surprisingly <lb/>negative for Ferralsols and only positive if biochar was applied alone (between -5.6% to <lb/>+1.9%). For Anthroposols and Vertisols, highest increases were achieved with rice husk bio-<lb/>char + vermicomposts (+7.2% and +5.2% respectively). Our socio-economic evaluation <lb/>showed that farmers with a stronger economical position showed greater interest towards <lb/>technology like biochar (factor 1.3 to 1.6 higher for farmers cultivating Anthroposols and/or <lb/>Vertisols compared to Ferralsols), while poorer farmers more skepticism, which may lead to <lb/>an increased economical gap within rural communities if technologies are not implemented <lb/>with long-term guidance. These results advocate for an interdisciplinary evaluation of agricul-<lb/>tural technology prior to its implementation as a development tool in the field. <lb/>PLOS ONE <lb/>PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263302 January 28, 2022 <lb/>1 / 24 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>OPEN ACCESS <lb/>Citation: Bellè S-L, Riotte J, Backhaus N, Sekhar <lb/>M, Jouquet P, Abiven S (2022) Tailor-made <lb/>biochar systems: Interdisciplinary evaluations of <lb/>ecosystem services and farmer livelihoods in <lb/>tropical agro-ecosystems.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Agricultural intensification over the last decades has contributed substantially to the decrease <lb/>of ecosystem services provided by soils [1, 2]. The (over)use of synthetic inputs in agricultural <lb/>production has unbalanced biogeochemical cycles, depleted natural resource pools, contami-<lb/>nated water bodies, polluted and degraded the arable soils as the backbone of agriculture and <lb/>ultimately increased the dependency of farmers [2-4]. In India, the liberalization of agriculture <lb/>during the green revolution in the 1960ies induced a trend towards cash crop production [5, <lb/>6] and contributed to major ecological as well as socio-economic crises [7]. The reduction of <lb/>soil fertility, and accordingly decreasing crop yields, has led to significant farmers&apos; distress and <lb/>indebtedness [5, 8], necessitating an urgent, yet possible [9] shift towards sustainable agricul-<lb/>tural practices and simultaneous support to ecosystem services essential for food production <lb/>and farmers livelihoods [10, 11]. Organic matter management (OMM) can regulate essential <lb/>biochemical and physical processes in soils and sufficient, long-term amounts of soil organic <lb/>matter (SOM) is precondition for soils to provide the ecosystem services needed for durable <lb/>soil fertility and agricultural production [12-14]. Availability of organic matter (OM; crop resi-<lb/>dues, animal excreta) in India can be between 320 up to 840 Million tons annually [9, 15], <lb/>which equals on average 2.5 tons OM per hectare (considering a total cropping area of 180.9 <lb/>million hectares [9]). The surplus OM (i.e. OM not used for any other domestic purposes) is <lb/>between 25-72%, including major crops grown in the study area in Karnataka (sugarcane <lb/>bagasse, wheat, coconut shell, rice straw, banana) [16, 17]. <lb/>Agriculture in tropical regions is highly relevant regarding food production and security at <lb/>the global scale [18]. However, the tropics are more vulnerable to global changes such as cli-<lb/>mate and land-use change across climate zones of the Earth [4]. The state of Karnataka, mostly <lb/>located in sub-humid to semi-arid climates in the southern part of the Indian peninsula, is <lb/>among the most vulnerable Indian states to climate change [19]. Major parts are prone to <lb/>drought and soil degradation, which are only two of the challenges in relation to climate and <lb/>land-use changes observed in many places in the tropics [19, 20]. In many parts of India, espe-<lb/>cially in the South, irrigation and consequently agricultural production depends to a large <lb/>extent on monsoonal rainfall patterns and groundwater irrigation [19, 21]. In addition, soils <lb/>are highly depleted in SOM, because of conditions favorable to high export of carbon through <lb/>crop production, limited inputs of OM to soils [22, 23]; and high mineralization rates [18]. <lb/>These soils are subject to leaching of major macro-and micronutrients, and reduction in <lb/>aggregate stability [24-26], resulting in a limited potential to provide essential ecosystem ser-<lb/>vices [1]. <lb/>OM inputs are also key for securing agricultural sustainability of rural livelihoods through <lb/>appropriate income generation [11] and reducing dependency on external inputs [4, 27]. <lb/>Adaptive OMM to site-specific agro-ecosystems, which identifies and embeds traditional <lb/>(local) knowledge (defined as &quot;tacit and explicit knowledge possessed and used by people who <lb/>share the same culture&quot; according to the Oxford Dictionary of Human Geography ([28])) and <lb/>agricultural practices of rural communities, is critical to be a successful solution to the current <lb/>challenges as it include site-specific adaptation barriers for farmer communities. Tailor-made <lb/>OMM considers social issues such as traditional perception and livelihood practices of farm-<lb/>ers, autonomy and participation concerns, knowledge dissemination in existing networks and <lb/>the farmers&apos; need satisfaction [29]. Barriers also refer to site-specific economical concerns like <lb/>agricultural residue availability [11, 29] and resource competition for different uses of OM <lb/>[23]. <lb/>Among existing OMM techniques, composting and vermicomposting (utilizing earth-<lb/>worms to digest pre-composted OM), involving a process of aerobic or anaerobic degradation <lb/></body>

			<body>of mostly lingo-cellulosic biomass and/or animal excreta [30], are already perceived as valuable <lb/>methods of converting OM into soil amendments [31, 32] and are applied by rural farmer <lb/>communities in India [33]. Biochar, a carbonaceous product of intended heating of OM under <lb/>the absence or low levels of oxygen and temperatures above 200˚C (&quot;pyrolysis&quot;) [34], has been <lb/>shown to have multifaceted effects on soil properties including changes in soil pH, porosity, <lb/>water-retention potential and plant-available nutrients [35-38]. Both composts and biochar <lb/>have been proposed to increase soil fertility and agricultural productivity, while simultaneously <lb/>reducing the environmental impact of agriculture and socio-economic dependency of farmers <lb/>[39, 40]. Next generation of OM inputs, like biochar-based fertilizers, consider the comple-<lb/>mentarity of inputs combined together. In this case, inputs with synergic and antagonistic <lb/>properties are added together to the soil, for example biochar and compost, combining amend-<lb/>ment (physico-chemical capacity of biochar) and fertilizers (compost) [38, 41]. <lb/>Besides the prerequisite of a certain financial capital, availability of agricultural residues, <lb/>knowledge and technical skills, biochar is considered to be a sustainable tool for helping rural <lb/>farmer communities managing agricultural residues and reducing their dependency on exter-<lb/>nal inputs [12, 42, 43]. Adaptation of biochar technology to specific agro-ecological and socio-<lb/>economic settings, inclusion of traditional (local) knowledge and practices of rural farmer <lb/>communities, and resource competition with domestic usage of OM are further concerns that <lb/>need to be addressed when implementing tailor-made biochar systems to any site-specific con-<lb/>text [3, 42, 43]. In this regard, biochar-based fertilizer can be a solution to both environmental <lb/>as well as socio-economic concerns [38]. <lb/>The challenges described above call for an agriculture that fulfills in the same time ecologi-<lb/>cal, socio-economic as well as political aspects of sustainability [11, 44]. The benefits of OMM <lb/>according to soil types and agro-ecosystems as well as the site-specific, socio-economic barriers <lb/>are currently studied separately, in particular regarding applicability and alignment with the <lb/>agricultural sector [29, 45]. However, there is an urgent need to connect these evaluations in <lb/>an interdisciplinary effort across multiple scientific communities from the natural and social <lb/>sciences in order to develop and implement innovative cropping systems adaptive to specific <lb/>agro-ecosystems that improve rural farmers&apos; livelihoods in parallel to soil ecosystem services <lb/>[46-48]. We propose a novel, joint assessment of soil quality and farmers&apos; aspiration in order <lb/>to evaluate the conformity of OMM to existing rural farming communities by using a variety <lb/>of complementary methodologies rooted in human geography and the soil sciences. Our inter-<lb/>disciplinary approach could be seen as a first practical example on how to link agro-ecological <lb/>and socio-economic questions in agricultural research that can form the basis for future in-<lb/>depth, long-term field trials on OMM together with local farmer communities in tropical <lb/>regions [46, 47]. This could ultimately help to develop sustainable agricultural technologies for <lb/>the development or local agricultural and industrial sectors. We led in parallel qualitative inter-<lb/>views and a soil manipulative study to evaluate the potentials of OM inputs ((vermi-) composts <lb/>(derived from OM such as crop residues, cow dung, leaves, etc.), biochar (derived from coco-<lb/>nut shell and rice husk) or next generation combination of inputs) to common tropical soil <lb/>types from southwestern India (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol). To do so, we estimated <lb/>effect sizes of soil quality indicators, selected from a list of commonly used parameters, such as <lb/>water-holding capacity (WHC), total carbon, total nitrogen (TC and TN) and pH after OM <lb/>application [14]. Then, we evaluated farmers&apos; aspiration through in-depth, qualitative inter-<lb/>views based on a predefined topic guide and by selecting farmers cultivating the same soils <lb/>as those experiments took place. The study was conducted in the cultivated watershed of <lb/>Berambadi in southwestern India, which is part of the Kabini CZO and SNO M-TROPICS <lb/>program [49]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Material and methods <lb/>Case study: The Berambadi watershed in southwestern Karnataka (India) <lb/>Research was carried out in the Berambadi watershed (11˚43&apos;00&apos;&apos; to 11˚48&apos;00&apos;&apos; N, 76˚31&apos;00&apos;&apos; to <lb/>76˚4&apos;&apos;00&apos;&apos; E) in Chamarajanagar district in southwestern Karnataka. The watershed is situated <lb/>on the Deccan plateau east of the Western Ghats and represents a sub-humid tropical water-<lb/>shed. It belongs to the Kabini CZO and SNO M-TROPICS program, and is a collaboration <lb/>between the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and IRD [49, 50]. <lb/>The geology in the southern parts of the Deccan plateau is characterized by granitic gneiss, <lb/>which represent the basis of the predominantly occurring red soils (Ferralsols and chromic <lb/>Luvisols) on hills/hill slopes and the black soils (Vertisols and Vertic integrades) close to the <lb/>river banks [51, 52]. The topography induced by the Western Ghats mountain range results in <lb/>an increasing water availability from east towards west as well as an spatially heterogeneous <lb/>pattern of soil types. These natural factors, which cause a variable environment on a small <lb/>scale, make the Berambadi watershed a critical geographical region for scientific observations <lb/>[50]. <lb/>Agriculture in the region is dictated by monsoon dynamics and groundwater tables, and <lb/>crops are grown either in Kharif season (June to September) and/or Rabi Season (October to <lb/>December), whereas in summer (January to May) only limited, irrigated agriculture is prac-<lb/>ticed [50, 52]. Farmers either grow perennial (turmeric, sugarcane, banana), annual (Jowar, <lb/>sunflower, Ragi) or short-term (vegetables, pulses, grams) crops, mainly dependent on the irri-<lb/>gation type with farmers owning bore wells cultivating all year round [49, 52]. <lb/>Soil sampling and characterization <lb/>We excavated three pits for each of the three prevalent soil types cultivated by farmers <lb/>(Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol) in Berambadi watershed to a depth of 20 centimeters <lb/>(agricultural horizon), subsequently mixed the soil to one composite sample for each soil, <lb/>which was air-dried and packed for transportation. Samples of the Anthroposol (Ferralsol <lb/>where river (tank) sediments were applied [53]) were taken on the farm of F23 in Berambadi <lb/>town. Samples of the Ferralsol (field along a gentle hillslope) and Vertisol (field next to the <lb/>streambed) were taken on the farm of F11 and F12 in Gopalpura town respectively. The main <lb/>characteristics of the studied soils are shown in Table 1. <lb/>Organic matter inputs <lb/>Substrates were liberally provided by the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS Bangalore, <lb/>Prof. Prakash Nagabovanalli), by the Indo-French Cell for Water Sciences (Indian Institute of <lb/>Science, Bangalore) and by Karthik Vermicompost and Earthworm Consultancy. Five OM <lb/>inputs have been used: a compost (C1), produced in rotating drums from a mixture of cow <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>dung and crop residues (dried OM, leaves, etc.) where a microbial inoculum was added (UAS <lb/>Bangalore), two vermicomposts (VC1: produced in heaps of cow dung and crop residues in <lb/>the first phase, then filled in long solid tanks to which a earthworm culture was introduced <lb/>and then covered by plastic sheets (UAS Bangalore) and VC2: produced by farmers in heaps of <lb/>cow dung and organic waste (crop residues, food waste, leaves, branches) in a ratio 3:1, then <lb/>filled in solid tanks along an earthworm culture (Karthik Vermicompost and Earthworm Con-<lb/>sultancy)) and two types of biochar (coconut shell (B1), produced with the Kiln technique for <lb/>charcoal purposes and rice husk (B2), produced at the UAS Bangalore, using a retort pyroly-<lb/>ser). Main characteristics of the OM inputs are shown in Table 2 below. <lb/>Soil manipulative experiment <lb/>To study the effect of individual and combined OM inputs on four selected properties (WHC, <lb/>TC, C:N (TN), pH) of the three studied soils (Table 1), a static incubation experiment under <lb/>controlled conditions was performed over 70 days (based on [26, 54]). Soils were pre-incu-<lb/>bated with 15% deionized water of total mass for eight days. A total of 60 grams dry-equivalent <lb/>soil was put into 0.2 liter plastic cups and then thoroughly mixed with the OM. The amount of <lb/>OM to be added was calculated based on approximate application rates of farmers in Beram-<lb/>badi watershed. The empirical material from farmer interviews shows that farmers can gener-<lb/>ally apply between 5-10 tons of OM per hectare (t ha -1 ). With an approx. bulk density of 1.3 <lb/>tons per cubic meter (t m -3 ), the amount is calculated as followed: <lb/>OM input ¼ Soil mass � <lb/>AR OM <lb/>Soil depth xSoil area xSoil BD <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>where OM input represents the OM input for each cup (converted from tons (t) to milligrams <lb/>(mg), Soil mass the dry-equivalent soil mass for each cup (60 g = 0.00006 t), AR OM the applica-<lb/>tion rate of OM by farmers (we took the upper value of the range from 5-10 t ha -1 = 10 t ha -1 ), <lb/>Soil depth the depth of the agricultural horizon (20 centimeters = 0.2 meter), Soil area the refer-<lb/>ence area of one hectare in square meters (1 ha = 10&apos;000 m 2 ) and Soil BD represents the approx-<lb/>imated soil bulk density (1.3 t m -3 ). For single OM inputs (only biochar or only composts), <lb/>this resulted in an OM input of 230 mg to the soil (0.00006t � (10t/(0.2m � 10&apos;000m 2� 1.3 t m -3 )) = <lb/>2.3 � 10 −7 t = 230 mg), for combined OM inputs a mass equivalent of 115 mg of two OM (e.g. <lb/>C1 + B1). The OM was carefully mixed with the first few centimeter of soil. The soil was <lb/>slightly compressed and plastic cubs were put in 2 liter glass jars alongside a 20 milliliter glass <lb/>vial filled with deionized water. The jars were put into an incubator and kept at 24 ˚C, which <lb/>corresponds to the mean annual air temperature of Berambadi weather station. Each OM <lb/>input for each soil was prepared in triplicates. The samples were periodically weighed to track <lb/>loss of moisture and the jars were regularly opened to renew oxygen. Controls were prepared <lb/>the same way without application of OM in triplicates. <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Soil analysis <lb/>After the experiment, (soil) samples were dried for 24 hours at 40 ˚C and then milled using a <lb/>planetary mill (Fritsch pulverisette 5, Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). Biochar sub-<lb/>samples were further milled with a horizontal mill (Retsch MM400, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Ger-<lb/>many). The pH was measured with a Methrom 692 pH/Ion meter (Methrom Schweiz AG, <lb/>Zofingen, Switzerland) in a 1:5 soil:water solution according to ISO 10390:2021. The sieved <lb/>(&lt; 2 mm) samples were preliminary stirred for 30 minutes at a rate of &lt; 500 rpm, then put to <lb/>settle for one hour before measurement, and then the pH was measured in the soil suspension <lb/>with a glass electrode. Water-holding capacity (WHC) was assessed with a pF laboratory sta-<lb/>tion from ecoTech (ecoTech Umwelt-Messsysteme GmbH, Bonn, Germany). Each replicate <lb/>was weighed by volume into metal rings and the material was held by a fine tissue net. Weights <lb/>were noted down and subsequently put into a water bath for 24 hours until saturation <lb/>occurred. Samples were placed on a suction plate and the suction tension was set for field <lb/>capacity at -325 to -335 millibar (= 33 kPa). Samples were regularly weighed and measure-<lb/>ments stopped when only minor variations occurred (&lt;0.5 grams). Samples were dried for 24 <lb/>hours at 105 ˚C and then weighed. The volumetric water content (or the WHC) was calculated <lb/>as the difference between the weight in equilibrium at field capacity and the dry weight. Total <lb/>C and N contents were measured by an Elemental Analyzer-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer <lb/>(EA-IRMS; Flash 2000-HT Plus, linked by Conflo IV to Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spec-<lb/>trometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>We performed an analysis of variance for the full dataset derived from the incubation experi-<lb/>ment, testing for significant differences of measured soil properties (WHC, TC, C:N, pH) <lb/>between soils, OM and their interactions (two-way ANOVA, n = 3). Subsequently, we per-<lb/>formed another analysis of variance on the measured soil properties (WHC, TC, C:N, pH) for <lb/>each soil type separately, with the OM inputs as the independent variable (one-way ANOVA, <lb/>n = 3). For both ANOVA&apos;s, we used Levene&apos;s test to check the assumption of homogeneity of <lb/>variance (center = mean), a Shapiro-Wilk test on the ANOVA residuals to check for the <lb/>assumption of normality and a Fisher&apos;s least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc test to check <lb/>for significance (alpha = 0.05, p.adj. = bonferroni). Statistical analysis was carried out using R <lb/>Studio 1.3.1093 (2009-2020), R Version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2020). All values reported repre-<lb/>sent means with one standard deviation. <lb/>While it would have been possible to use simple, descriptive statistics on the numbers <lb/>derived from the coding of empirical data of farmers&apos; interviews, we refrained from doing so <lb/>because these numbers (mainly percentages) represent assigned codes to text sequences that <lb/>originate from the statements of farmers during the interviews, and not measured data (see <lb/>next section). However, there is an ongoing debate in qualitative research if simple statistics <lb/>can be used for qualitative data [55]. <lb/>Assessment of farmers&apos; traditional (local) knowledge, practices and <lb/>aspirations-Grounded Theory Methodology <lb/>Qualitative data collection followed the order of: 1) Explorative expert interviews (n = 9) with <lb/>scientists to get an overview over the agrarian context of the research area and to initialize a <lb/>network to the research area [56-58], 2) Familiarization with the area of research, leading dis-<lb/>cussions with local experts (scientists, NGO-workers and private companies) were done <lb/>(n = 5) and 3) In-depth, qualitative interviews with farmers (n = 29; Anthroposol: n = 13, <lb/></body>

The empirical material (transcripts) <lb/>was subsequently coded and categorized according to Grounded Theory [61-63] with the cod-<lb/>ing software MAXQDA 12 (VERBI GmbH). Analysis and comparison of codes and categories <lb/>was stopped when theoretical saturation occurred, i.e. additional empirical material and their <lb/>conceptualization (codes) did not contribute to new insights within the created categories <lb/>[61]. Results of this process were formulated in theses about the traditional (local) knowledge, <lb/>practices and aspirations of farmers on OMM (including biochar applications) in the research <lb/>area. Codes about specific dimensions of the research (i.e. expectations or doubts about tech-<lb/>nology) from interview data were used to calculate the amount of farmers designating a spe-<lb/>cific point of interest (i.e. number of farmer designating interest in biochar divided by all <lb/>farmers (or all farmers of each soil type)). <lb/>Qualitative research was conducted according to the &quot;Guidelines on Ethics and Safety in <lb/>Fieldwork for Researchers in Human Geography&quot; of the Department of Geography, University <lb/>of Zurich (accessible online at https://www.geo.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:d546eb46-376b-4109-ae9d-<lb/>719d2d400f3d/Ethics_Guidelines.docx) and the guidelines of data protection in qualitative <lb/>research described in ref [64]. Farmers were informed about the aim and content of the <lb/>research study and verbally asked for their consent to participate in the interview campaign. <lb/>Permission to conduct and record interviews and subsequently transcribe and analyze inter-<lb/>view data anonymously was obtained prior to each interview. Each farmer was assigned a <lb/>unique, anonymous code (F1-F29). <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Effect sizes of soil quality indicators after organic matter inputs <lb/>Neither application of biochar, composts nor combined OM inputs had a clear unilateral bene-<lb/>ficial effect on the studied soil properties of the Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol (Figs 1 and <lb/>2; Tables 3 and 4), in line with the most recent review on the effect of biochar systems on soil <lb/>and plant responses [38]. In consequence, OMM results in tradeoffs for the farmer (Fig 3) <lb/>[65]. Studied parameters (WHC, TC, C:N and pH) showed strong differences between soils <lb/>and OM inputs, as well as their interaction (Table 3). <lb/>Almost all OM inputs led to an initial reduction of the WHC of soils after 70 days of incuba-<lb/>tion (Fig 1a and Table 4). In case of the Anthroposol (initial WHC = 14.02 ± 0.69%), except for <lb/>coconut shell biochar (B1 = 13.52 ± 0.54; p &gt; 0.05), all OM inputs resulted in significant <lb/>decreases in WHC, up to -27.29 ± 0.97% compared to the control (B2+C1 = 10.12 ± 0.14%; <lb/>p &lt; 0.05). Despite low initial value (5.97 ± 0.24%-Table 1; characteristic of soils from the sub-<lb/>humid tropics [51, 67]), the WHC of the Ferralsol only tends to increase with coconut shell <lb/>biochar alone (B1 = 6.07 ± 0.16%; p &gt; 0.05) or the same biochar mixed with composts <lb/>(B1+C1 = 6.57 ± 0.07%, B1+VC1 = 6.26 ± 0.31% and B1+VC2 = 6.12 ± 0.02%), but only the <lb/>first two of the mixed OM inputs were significantly different from the control soil (Table 4; <lb/>p &lt; 0.05). All other OM inputs led to a significant relative decrease compared to the control <lb/></body>

			<body>(-1.91 ± 5.20% to -17.70 ± 0.96%; Fig 1a), with lowest WHC when rice husk biochar was <lb/>applied in combination with vermicompost to the Ferralsol (B2+VC2 = 4.91 ± 0.06%; <lb/>p &lt; 0.05). For the Vertisol, most OM inputs led to a slight, not significant decrease in WHC <lb/>(initial WHC = 16.38 ± 1.20%; comparable to the volumetric water contents of Vertisols stud-<lb/>ied elsewhere in the research area [51]). This was not the case for three treatments where the <lb/>WHC increased for B2+VC2 = 16.89 ± 0.21%, B1+C1 = 18.16 ± 3.28% and B2+-<lb/>C1 = 18.90 ± 1.87%; however only significantly in the last case (Table 4; p &lt; 0.05). Overall, <lb/>highest increases were observed for coconut shell biochar + compost added to the Ferralsol <lb/>(+10.07 ± 1.14%) and Vertisol (+10.87 ± 20.04%), and rice husk biochar and compost added to <lb/>the Vertisol (+15.4 ± 11.42%), but with considerable variability (Fig 1a). The positive responses <lb/>of soil WHC after a combined application of biochar with either compost [68] or vermicom-<lb/>post [69] were also found in previous research. Application of OM to soils is expected to <lb/>improve soil moisture content, micro-and macro-pore density, and thus infiltration [70-72]. <lb/>Despite its initial very low WHC and general poor characteristics (Table 1), the Ferralsol gen-<lb/>erally did not benefit from these OM applications. This contradicts several studies where bio-<lb/>char [73-75] or compost [69-72] increased water storage in soils, particularly also for sandy <lb/>soils with low initial WHC common in tropical regions [38, 73, 74] and also for other Ferral-<lb/>sols [68]. In addition, we observed the strongest negative responses in soil WHC in the pres-<lb/>ence of rice husk biochar, which contradicts a study using the same biochar feedstock [75]. <lb/>Fig 1.

			<body>Reduction of soil WHC in presence of biochar may be linked to initial hydrophobic properties <lb/>of its surface, which disappear over the long-term with the oxidation of hydrophobic func-<lb/>tional groups [73, 76]. Another possible explanation for the low and/or mostly negative WHC <lb/>responses observed in our study could be related to the application rate of 10 t OM ha -1 (based <lb/>on local conditions of farmers in the research area), which is much lower compared to rates <lb/>(133 and 40 t biochar ha -1 respectively) in controlled-condition experiments [74] or summa-<lb/>rized in a recent review [38]. <lb/>Fig 2.

Even if all OM inputs except for one of <lb/>the vermicomposts (VC2 = 1.04 ± 0.06%; possibly due to fast decomposition of the added and/ <lb/>or native C [40]) increased the C content of the control Anthroposol (1.13 ± 0.03%), these <lb/>changes were not significant (Table 4; p &gt; 0.05). Highest relative changes in TC contents <lb/>(+12.54 ± 10.29%; Fig 1b) were observed after applying coconut shell biochar mixed with ver-<lb/>micompost for the Anthroposol (B1+VC2 = 1.27 ± 0.11%). Also in case of the Ferralsol with <lb/>the lowest initial C content (0.45 ± 0.03%), all OM inputs, except for the combination of coco-<lb/>nut shell biochar and compost (B1+C1 = 0.66 ± 0.26%; p &lt; 0.05), resulted in no significant <lb/>increase in the C content of the soil (Table 4). For the Vertisol (initial C content of <lb/>1.56 ± 0.05%), only the combination of rice husk biochar and compost (1.77 ± 0.13% <lb/>(13.84 ± 8.15%; Fig 1b) led to a significant increase in C contents (Table 4; p &lt; 0.05). For this <lb/>specific parameter, the initial C contents of soil, lower for the Ferralsol, explain directly our <lb/>observations that for a given OM input, the relative increases compared to control soils were <lb/>mostly highest for the Ferralsol and lowest for the Vertisol (Fig 1b). The relative changes <lb/>observed for the Ferralsol are in the same magnitude as for a Ferralsol amended with different <lb/>mixtures of biochar, composts and fertilizer in tropical, northern Australia [68] or lateritic, <lb/>low-quality soils in plot studies in Tamil Nadu, India [18]. However, the effects were not <lb/>strictly additive, but rather synergetic for certain OM inputs and soils (Fig 2b) [37]. Consider-<lb/>ing the relative short duration of our experiment, it is probable that biochar protected the asso-<lb/>ciated compost from decomposition, which is in line with our observation of higher soil C <lb/>contents after 70 days of incubation for biochars mixed with composts compared to composts <lb/>only [40]. The amplitude of the TC increase was also very dependent on the type of biochar <lb/>and compost and the initial soil [38]. However, no clear trend can be associated to these <lb/>changes and most positive responses in C contents of amended soils where not significant <lb/>Fig 3.

			<body>compared to the three control soils (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol), which is in line with <lb/>similar incubation studies with biochar and tropical soils [26]. <lb/>C:N ratios increased when biochar was applied alone or in mixture with composts, and gen-<lb/>erally remained close to the initial soil C:N value with no significant difference after applica-<lb/>tion of composts alone (Figs 1c and 2c; Table 3). The Anthroposol with an initial C:N ratio of <lb/>9.55 ± 0.10 showed highest increases when biochar was applied alone (B1 = 10.84 ± 0.53 <lb/>(+13.54 ± 5.56%) and B2 = 11.00 ± 0.22 (+15.16 ± 2.33%)) or in combination with vermicom-<lb/>post (B1+VC2 = 10.88 ± 0.56 (+13.91 ± 5.82%)). All OM inputs including biochar significantly <lb/>increased the C:N ratio of the Anthroposol (Table 3; p &lt; 0.05). For the Ferralsol, the same <lb/>effect for the application of biochar alone or in combination with composts could be observed <lb/>on the initial soil C:N ratio as for the Anthroposol (Fig 1c and Table 3). In contrast however, <lb/>only biochar alone and coconut shell biochar with composts (up to 12.42 ± 2.71 (+43.72 ± <lb/>31.43%) for B1+C1) were significantly different from the control, but not the combination of <lb/>rice husk biochar and composts (Table 3; at p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the OM inputs had gener-<lb/>ally more influence on the C:N ratio of the Ferralsol (mostly &gt; 20% increase; Figs 1c and 2c) <lb/>than the Anthroposol. No differences between the Vertisol treated with OM and the control <lb/>soil could be observed in our data in terms of C:N (Table 3; p &gt; 0.05), probably because the <lb/>initial C:N of the Vertisol was already high (15.89 ± 0.30). The highest effect was achieved with <lb/>application of coconut shell biochar (e.g. B1 = 17.02 ± 0.17). Our observations of steady C:N <lb/>ratios after application of composts [39, 77], and increases after application of biochar alone <lb/>[37, 78] or in combination with composts are in line with previous field and/or laboratory <lb/>studies [77, 79]. Considering C:N values of the OM inputs (Table 2), we expected that compost <lb/>would compensate for C:N increase due to biochar. On the contrary, the C:N became very <lb/>high in presence of biochar, in particular for the Ferralsol (Fig 1c). Considering that this nitro-<lb/>gen can be a source of nutrients for plants on the long-term, the increase of C at the detriment <lb/>of N may be a potential issue for soil fertility, as already pointed out in the literature [80, 81]. <lb/>However, even if the C:N increases in presence of sole ore mixed biochar applications with <lb/>composts, the (surface) properties of biochar may have positive effects on the N availability <lb/>through reduced losses of ammonium and nitrate by volatilization or leaching [69, 79, 82]. <lb/>All OM inputs resulted in a pH increase of the Anthroposol compared to the control <lb/>(6.97 ± 0.06), but the effect was mostly only significant when biochar was applied in combina-<lb/>tion with composts and highest for rice husk biochar mixed with vermicompost (B2+VC1 = <lb/>7.46 ± 0.06 (+7.18 ± 0.83%); Fig 1d and Table 4). The Ferralsol included in our study had a <lb/>higher pH (7.10 ± 0.10) compared to the values generally reported for Ferralsols in literature <lb/>[67, 68]. Only applying biochar alone slightly increased the pH (+1.88 ± 0.81% (coconut shell) <lb/>resp. +0.94 ± 0.81% (rice husk)), while all other inputs led to a relative decrease by up to <lb/>-5.63 ± 1.41% for biochar in combination with composts (B2+VC2 = 6.70 ± 0.10; Table 4; <lb/>p &lt;0.05). This initial high pH could have resulted from application of alkaline fertilizers (ashes <lb/>from slash-and-burn agriculture) by the farmer prior to our sampling. The addition of rice <lb/>husk biochar and composts resulted in a significant relative increase of up to +5.15 ± 1.49% in <lb/>the Vertisol (+0.4 in pH for B2+VC1 (8.17 ± 0.11)), whereas all other OM inputs were not dif-<lb/>ferent from the control soil (7.77 ± 0.11; Table 4). The effect of biochar application depends <lb/>largely on intrinsic soil properties such as initial soil pH and cation exchange capacity, but <lb/>also on biochar quality (pH, exchangeable base cation concentration, CaCO 3 content and <lb/>therefore acid (H + ) buffer capacity) and quantities applied [37, 83, 84]. Biochar application <lb/>results mainly in positive, increasing effects on pH of non-amended soils with a larger effect <lb/>on acidic soils [37, 38]. This is what we observed here, with stronger increases in the Anthro-<lb/>posol. We did not observe differences in soil pH responses related to the biochar quality (input <lb/>material, production conditions); probably because the differences in pH between soils were <lb/></body>

			<body>not so strong resp. important (no significant differences in soil pH between OM inputs includ-<lb/>ing coconut shell resp. rice husk biochar). In addition, and in contrast to the slight and signifi-<lb/>cant positive effect size of biochar application on soil pH found in a global meta-analysis [37], <lb/>we could not observe any significant response in soil pH after biochar was applied alone <lb/>(Table 3). Application of composts may lead to reduction of soil pH through the release of <lb/>organic acids during decomposition of added OM or salts leaching [85], or an increase because <lb/>of the production of base cations or hydroxide anions during decomposition. Our data showed <lb/>effects in both directions: a decrease of the pH of the Ferralsol, and an increase of pH for <lb/>Anthroposol and Vertisol (Fig 1b). Fig 2d shows that mixed application of biochar and com-<lb/>posts resulted in a decreased pH of the Ferralsol, but increased pH for the Anthroposol and <lb/>Vertisol. An increase in soil pH after application of mixtures of biochar and composts was also <lb/>observed under field conditions for Acrisols in the tropics [39, 69] and in pot experiments [86, <lb/>87]. In contrast, and, in line with our findings, a Ferralsol in the tropics of northern Queens-<lb/>land also showed reduced or similar pH to control soils after mixed OM inputs [88], which <lb/>may be the result of the increased mineralization of SOM after application of fresh OM to the <lb/>Ferralsol with low TC content [89, 90]. <lb/>Contrary to what was expected from the literature, and what was expected for the farmers, <lb/>biochars alone or in mixture did not improve unilaterally the soil properties of these tropical <lb/>soils, particularly of the Ferralsol, nicely highlighting the diverse responses of plant-soil sys-<lb/>tems to biochar applications [37, 38]. While it seems relatively simple to increase the TC con-<lb/>tent and to certain extends the pH of the soil [37], water and long-term nutrient status did not <lb/>improve, or degraded with the OM inputs (Figs 1 and 2; Table 3). It is likely that the duration <lb/>of the present incubation (70 days) could not capture the transition of biochar surfaces from <lb/>hydrophobicity towards higher affinity to water [76], but increases in the WHC of biochar-<lb/>amended soils on the long-term have already been proven in many cases [38, 73]; however, in <lb/>terms of nutrients such as N, our observations are to be seen more critical if these are not <lb/>plant-available on the longer-term [80, 81]. This divergent effect was even more marked for <lb/>the Ferralsol, which was identified with lower fertility, so where the largest impact was <lb/>expected [38, 91]. In addition, contrarily to our expectations, the mixture between composts <lb/>and biochar did not compensate systematically the shortcomings of OM inputs when applied <lb/>alone (as compared in Fig 2) [40]. While the TC content and C:N were almost systematically <lb/>higher for the mix, showing a synergetic effect between the two inputs [79], this was soil-<lb/>dependent for the WHC and for the pH. These two aspects highlight the versatility of biochar <lb/>inputs to soil properties [37], and so the need to locally estimate its multi-seasonal impact, <lb/>under specific pedo-climatic conditions [38, 42]. <lb/>Traditional (local) knowledge and practices of farmers in the Berambadi <lb/>watershed regarding organic matter management <lb/>Tailor-made compost and biochar systems need to be adopted by the practices of rural farmer <lb/>communities as well as their aspirations towards working with the new OMM techniques in <lb/>their farming system [42, 43, 47]. To evaluate this, we conducted expert interviews (n = 14) <lb/>with scientists, NGOs and private companies active in the field of agricultural development, <lb/>and in-depth, qualitative interviews based on a standardized topic guide with farmers of the <lb/>Berambadi watershed (n = 29), cultivating the same soil types used for the manipulative soil <lb/>study (Anthroposol n = 13, Ferralsol n = 10 and Vertisol n = 6). The topic guide included ques-<lb/>tions about farming practices in general, about specific practices and perceptions regarding <lb/>OMM (i.e. composting, slash-and-burn, other usage of OM) and finally on aspirations upon <lb/>the introduction of new technologies like biochar (see Material and methods and S1 File). <lb/></body>

			<body>Our empirical data from the interviews revealed that farmers used specific traditional prac-<lb/>tices of composting (97% of farmers). These could range from traditional techniques like Jee-<lb/>vamrutha (liquid compost made of ten liters of cow urine, ten kilograms of cow dung, two <lb/>kilograms of black bean (powder), two kilograms of (black) Jaggery and one fist of soil, 17%) <lb/>or farmyard manure preparation (97%) to more knowledge-intensive setups of composting <lb/>(i.e. vermicomposting, 28%). Most of these practices have already been described in detail in <lb/>the literature, also specific methods practiced in India, but they are normally highly variable <lb/>locally [30]. Other traditional usage of OM included mulching (90%), forage for animals <lb/>(52%), fuel for cooking (72%), application of river sediments (17%; see ref [53]) and the appli-<lb/>cation of ash/charcoal from slash-and-burn agriculture or indoor cooking (59%), and these <lb/>were also found in a farmer survey in Karnataka, India [33]. Farmers&apos; knowledge about these <lb/>OM inputs originated from traditions (family/community, practical experience, 72%), individ-<lb/>uals (55%), local agricultural department (41%) or media (TV, books: 41%). Knowledge <lb/>included awareness regarding the preparation (materials, setup), application (rate), timing and <lb/>effects on soils (structure, moisture and nutrient contents, soil biota (earthworms)) and plants <lb/>(growth dynamics and yield) (Quote 1). <lb/>Quote 1 (F4): «So when he introduces this into the soil, there&apos;s a rotation happening because <lb/>of the worms and the soil. And then they form pores. Because of this, the soil becomes more <lb/>nutrient and when it becomes more nutrient, it gives a better yield.» <lb/>We further asked farmers about their knowledge on vermicomposting and biochar inputs. <lb/>Regarding vermicomposting, we found a gap between farmers&apos; knowledge and its practical <lb/>application (Quote 2). Even if farmers had such knowledge (97%) and some of them were will-<lb/>ing to apply the technology in their farming system (35%), the implementation level was found <lb/>to be low according to our data (28%). Information on implementation levels provided by <lb/>local scientists and NGO-workers in the study area (25% of farmers are using installed vermi-<lb/>composting units) and in scientific literature [33] confirm our results. Farmers stressed their <lb/>lack of practical experience (52%) or their negative experiences, i.e. weed growth, heat genera-<lb/>tion and short effect duration (21%) and lack of institutional guidance (14%; Table 5 and <lb/>Quote 3). <lb/>Quote 2 (F18): «So he says, he makes a bed of the cow dung first and then he puts the green <lb/>leaves. And then he puts the worms. And then he sprinkles it with water. Because it has to be <lb/>cold. Else the worms die. And once this is done, these eat and then you have the compost.» <lb/>Quote 3 (F22): «They have a communication problem from the officials. Because nobody <lb/>guided him so that he can do this. And there is a problem in our administrative system and in <lb/>the Karnataka government that whatever they want to do, is not reaching the farmers. So the <lb/>implementation is not there. Nobody is there to guide them properly and communicate ideas <lb/>to them.» <lb/>According to our discussions with experts, biochar systems in India were limited to scien-<lb/>tific studies and a broader public interest at the time of fieldwork, which is confirmed by recent <lb/>reports on the topic [16, 92]. Interview data showed that only few farmers knew about biochar <lb/>systems (31%) and even fewer who actively engaged in the concept (Quote 4). Nonetheless, <lb/>even if the level of knowledge can be considered low, still many farmers showed great interest <lb/>in biochar systems (83%, Fig 3) and 17% asked about implementing it in their farming system <lb/></body>

			<body>Quote 5 (F15): «How come we have not heard about it and nobody has told us about it?» <lb/>When discussing about biochar technology, farmers often related to their traditional (local) <lb/>knowledge and practice of ash/charcoal application (59%; Table 5). Application of ash/char-<lb/>coal was considered to be beneficial (28%) or hazardous (21%) for soil fertility and plant <lb/>growth by farmers (Quotes 6 and 7), including positive (improvement in moisture and nutri-<lb/>ent contents and soil structure) and negative (heat generation, death of earthworms, decreased <lb/>crop growth) effects. The rationales of adopting slash-and-burn agriculture (or applying ash/ <lb/>charcoal to soils) of farmers in the research area are in line with the literature [93]. Further-<lb/>more, in accordance with the divided opinions of farmers towards the benefits and risks of this <lb/>practice (Quotes 6 and 7), the sustainability of slash-and-burn agriculture is highly debated in <lb/>the scientific literature until today [93-95]. <lb/>Quote 6 (F1): «Because of the water-holding capacity he is using the ash.» <lb/>Quote 7 (F18): «And the remains is an ash. Nobody puts that ash back into the soil because if <lb/>you put that, you&apos;ll never get a yield. The plants will never grow well. So nobody uses that.» <lb/>Farmers&apos; perceptions about ash/charcoal application greatly influenced their attitude <lb/>towards the introduction of biochar-based fertilizer systems, and farmers who engaged in <lb/>these traditional practices were generally more open to biochar technology. The occurrence of <lb/>such soil fertilization practices involving ash/charcoal applications from various sources <lb/>(slash-burn agriculture, home cooking, and processing agricultural residues) could increase <lb/>the implementation potential of biochar-based fertilization [43, 48]. A shift from slash-and-<lb/>burn to slash-and-char farming practices could be viable since farmers possess significant <lb/>knowledge about OMM and burning processes; however, site-specific concerns such as the <lb/>availability and suitability of OM for charring and potential increased labor requirements due <lb/>to collection of OM on fields instead of burning need to be addressed [12, 48]. <lb/>Farmers&apos; aspirations towards the introduction of tailor-made biochar-<lb/>based fertilizer systems <lb/>Interviewed experts pointed out three socio-economic and three agro-ecological categories <lb/>that are crucial for a successful implementation of biochar-based fertilizer systems (Table 5). <lb/>Socio-economic categories included educational issues (long-term guidance, knowledge <lb/>requirements), financial issues (cost-efficiency, labor, level of effort, resource availability and <lb/>competition) and technological issues (low-tech setups, duration). Agro-ecological categories <lb/>included soil related issues (increase nutrient level and soil fertility), plant related issues <lb/>(increase crop growth/yield) and ecosystem related issues (OM inputs, suitability for agro-eco-<lb/>systems). Empirical data from interviews with farmers showed that farmers could precisely <lb/>name their socio-economic and agro-ecological aspirations towards tailor-made OMM <lb/>(Table 5, according to expert categories). Farmers especially emphasised their need for guid-<lb/>ance and acquisition of practical knowledge in a participatory way when it came to new OMM <lb/>(79%), and they expressed doubts about the long-term institutional support (21%), which con-<lb/>stitute major adaptation barriers to technology [29, 48]. Another crucial socio-economic <lb/>aspect concerns the implementation costs especially regarding additional labor requirements <lb/>and investment capacities (48%) [42, 43]. Both farmers and experts stressed out resource avail-<lb/>ability and suitability as well as the competition with other local usages of OM as major con-<lb/>straints for tailor-made, site-specific biochar systems (Table 5), which was also emphasized in <lb/>a recent review on biochar systems [38, 48]. Whether OM was perceived as a viable agronomic <lb/></body>

			<body>input for OMM, including biochar production, depended on the site-specific cropping systems <lb/>(farming system (organic or conventional), traditional OMM practices, type of plants grown) <lb/>of individual farmers (Quotes 8 and 9) [17, 23]. The production of biochar from on-farm (hor-<lb/>ticulture) or forest trees was considered to be problematic and concerns were expressed <lb/>regarding the need for collecting wood biomass when engaging with biochar technology [3]. <lb/>In this regard, it could well be that implementation of biochar systems could compete with tra-<lb/>ditional practices of OM usage (as defined above) for resources [6], and needs to be considered <lb/>in further agricultural development projects [48]. <lb/>Quote 8 (F7): «Yes it is good that what we can put into the soil, the remains of the plants. He <lb/>puts it into the soil.» <lb/>Quote 9 (F23): «So he feels that if you remove that it&apos;s just a waste. So what can you do with <lb/>it? So they burn it and put it into the field.» <lb/>Interview data further revealed that improved soil fertility and crop growth/yield were the <lb/>major agro-ecological aspirations of farmers towards vermicomposting and biochar technol-<lb/>ogy (Table 5). These aspirations could be met with biochar-based fertilizers (see Figs 1 and 2 <lb/>and explanations above) and literature suggests that the site-specific environmental (water <lb/>scarcity if no bore well irrigation) and soil quality problems (low SOC, generally low pH, poor <lb/>structure) of sub-humid tropical regions like Berambadi watershed could be tackled through <lb/>OM inputs such as biochar [12, 38, 42]. <lb/>Matching the effect of biochar-based fertilizers on soil quality with <lb/>farmers&apos; aspirations on organic matter management <lb/>Interviews with farmers (Table 5) and the manipulative soil study (Figs 1 and 2) revealed that <lb/>the site-specific contexts, to which OMM techniques such as biochar systems are intended to <lb/>be applied to, are key for successful implementation and sustainable agricultural development <lb/>as suggested also in recent literature [29, 38, 42]. Our dual interdisciplinary approach <lb/>highlighted a series of strong clear trends as well as contradictions or mismatches between <lb/>farmer&apos;s expectations and measured soil quality changes (Fig 3). The data from our socio-eco-<lb/>nomic study indicated that farmers were generally more interested in biochar technology than <lb/>composting irrespective of the farming system, which follows partially our soil quality evalua-<lb/>tion (Fig 3). However, farmers cultivating more fertile Vertisols and/or farmers who experi-<lb/>enced a stronger economic position based on bore well irrigation capacities (year round crop <lb/>production; see ref [50]) and land ownership, showed a greater interest towards new technol-<lb/>ogy like biochar, but a lower interest in existing, traditional (local) practices such as compost-<lb/>ing. Farmers who cultivated Ferralsols with poorer soil quality felt more confident with <lb/>traditional (local) practices rather than biochar technology, and greater skepticism towards <lb/>biochar indicated their low investment capacity and readiness to assume risks [29, 48]. <lb/>According to these findings, there is a clear danger that new technology implementation will <lb/>mainly benefit to the wealthiest, and may increase the gap between farmers within a commu-<lb/>nity if innovations are not widely accessible to all [3]. <lb/>Besides their interest and skepticism, farmers could further exactly rate the relative impor-<lb/>tance of soil quality criteria such as water and nutrient levels, and soil fertility in general (Fig <lb/>3), which allowed to assess which technology would match their aspirations (Table 5). Even if <lb/>water represented a major problem in the study area [50, 52], farmers did not designate it as <lb/>the major criteria during fieldwork (&lt;50% mentioned water as a criteria), partially because <lb/>irrigation is still possible year round using groundwater for farmers possessing bore wells <lb/></body>

			<body>(compared to rain-fed irrigation) [50]; however, with depletion of groundwater resources and <lb/>climate change, water availability will likely become a major concern for many more farmers <lb/>in the semi-arid areas of southwestern India [52]. Biochar-based fertilizer (mixture of biochar <lb/>and composts) only improve WHC for the Vertisol and Ferralsol in some cases, but not for the <lb/>Anthroposol, which represented the soil cultivated by farmers that rated water as most impor-<lb/>tant (Fig 3), but these effects likely change over longer-term [76]. More generally, while aspira-<lb/>tions and global effects of biochar and compost are in line, we observed several mismatches at <lb/>local level between the absolute soil quality criteria, the expectations from the farmers given a <lb/>particular soil, and the potential of new OM inputs to improve the soil quality. These very local <lb/>contradictions could only be detected by combining interviews and experimentations, so we <lb/>can only strongly encourage such approaches to design the implementation of new cropping <lb/>systems [38, 42]. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Our study demonstrates that OM inputs such as biochar for sustainable agricultural develop-<lb/>ment need to be tailor-made for site-specific socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts. By <lb/>applying an interdisciplinary research approach, we could identify OMM techniques that can <lb/>increase the ecosystem services of soils with specific ecological challenges that needed to be <lb/>solved in order to sustain or increase agricultural production and rural farmer livelihoods, and <lb/>that simultaneously address the site-specific adaptation barriers and aspirations of farmer <lb/>communities towards biochar technology. <lb/>Biochar-based fertilizers that include a mixture of biochar and other OM such as composts <lb/>represented a viable solution for soil quality improvements of three tropical, agricultural soils <lb/>(Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol) along with their suitability to incorporate traditional <lb/>(local) knowledge and practices of small-scale farmers in a sub-humid tropical watershed. <lb/>Including traditional (local) knowledge and practices related to OMM, farmers&apos; aspirations <lb/>towards new technologies and concerns regarding resource availability, suitability and compe-<lb/>tition for biochar-based fertilizers will ultimately increase the implementation potential of <lb/>such applications for sustainable agricultural development. <lb/>The substantial interest of farmers in biochar technology, irrespective of farming systems, <lb/>provides scope for in-depth field trials, where biochar-based fertilizers can directly be tested <lb/>together with farmers, including the site-specific socio-economic and agro-ecological chal-<lb/>lenges faced by rural farmer communities in different environmental settings. Future research <lb/>could therefore provide answers to questions regarding type, quality and rates of OM applied, <lb/>the influence of a changing climate on tropical agro-ecosystems as well as future cropping <lb/>strategies of rural farmer communities. <lb/></body>
