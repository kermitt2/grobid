			<body>Background: Elderly patients undergoing surgery are prone to cognitive decline known as peri-<lb/>operative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Several studies have shown that the microglial acti-<lb/>vation and the decrease of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in gut induced by surgery may be <lb/>related to the pathogenesis of PND. The purpose of this study was to determine whether microglia <lb/>and short-chain fatty acids were involved in cognitive dysfunction in aged rats. <lb/>Methods: Male wild-type Wistar rats aged 11-12 months were randomly divided into control <lb/>group (Ctrl: Veh group), propionic acid group (Ctrl: PA group), exploratory laparotomy group <lb/>(LP: Veh group) and propionic acid + exploratory laparotomy group (LP: PA group) according to <lb/>whether exploratory laparotomy (LP) or PA pretreatment for 21 days was performed. The motor <lb/>ability of the rats was evaluated by open field test on postoperative day 3 (POD3), and then the <lb/>cognitive function was evaluated by Y-maze test and fear conditioning test. The expression of IL-<lb/>1β, IL-6, RORγt and IL-17A mRNA in hippocampus was detected by RT-qPCR, the expression of IL-<lb/>17A and IL-17RA in hippocampus was detected by Western blot, and the activation of microglia <lb/>was detected by immunofluorescence. <lb/>Results: The PND rat model was successfully established by laparotomy. Compared with Ctrl: Veh <lb/>group, the body weight of LP: Veh group decreased, the percentage of spontaneous alternations in <lb/>Y maze decreased (P &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of freezing time in contextual fear test <lb/>decreased (P &lt; 0.001). Surgery triggers neuroinflammation, manifested as the elevated levels of <lb/>the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (P &lt; 0.001) and IL-6 (P &lt; 0.001), the increased expression of <lb/>the transcription factor RORγt (P = 0.0181, POD1; P = 0.0073, POD5)and major inflammatory <lb/>cytokines IL-17A (P = 0.0215, POD1; P = 0.0071, POD5), and the increased average fluorescence <lb/>intensity of Iba1 (P &lt; 0.001, POD1; P &lt; 0.001, POD5). After PA preconditioning, the recovery of <lb/>rats in LP: PA group was faster than that in LP: Veh group as the body weight lost on POD1 (P = <lb/>0.0148) was close to the baseline level on POD5 (P = 0.1846), and they performed better in <lb/>behavioral tests. The levels of IL-1β (P &lt; 0.001) and IL-6 (P = 0.0035) inflammatory factors in <lb/></body>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) commonly observed in elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia [1]. The <lb/>incidence of PND ranged from 41 % to 75 % on POD7 and from 18 % to 45 % on the 3rd month after operation. PND is associated with <lb/>suboptimal functional recovery and increased mortality following major surgery [2,3]. Surgical interventions can trigger acute sys-<lb/>temic inflammation, subsequently leading to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, thereby contributing to <lb/>hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment [4-6]. Despite numerous studies highlighting pathological alterations linked to PND [7, <lb/>8], effective clinical strategies for prevention or treatment remain elusive. <lb/>T helper 17 cells (Th17 cells) are a distinct subset of CD4 + T cells, independent of Th1 and Th2 cells. They predominantly reside in <lb/>the lamina propria of intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes, playing a crucial role in acquired immune response, autoimmune <lb/>diseases, and transplant immune rejection. The transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) and signal <lb/>transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are specifically expressed by Th17 cells [9], regulating the differentiation of in-<lb/>testinal T cells into Th17 cells to significantly alleviate the neuroinflammation caused by their infiltration in multiple sclerosis and <lb/>experimental encephalomyelitis models [10,11]. IL-17 is primarily produced by Th17 cells, with six isoforms known as IL-17A~IL-17F <lb/>[12]. Among them, IL-17A is considered as one of the pro-inflammatory factors contributing to the pathogenesis of central nervous <lb/>system (CNS) inflammatory diseases [13,14]. The IL-17 receptor family consists of five members from IL-17RA to IL-17RE, of which <lb/>IL-17RA serves as a common receptor subunit for all subtypes [15]. The signal transduction of IL-17A occurs through the heterodimer <lb/>formed by IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptor subunits [16]. Although there is ongoing debate regarding neuronal expression of the IL-17A <lb/>receptor within CNS [17-19], microglia clearly express IL-17RA [20,21]. Given its pivotal role in neuroinflammation and neuro-<lb/>degeneration, we hypothesize that through interaction with microglia, IL-17A may contribute to the development and progression of <lb/>PND. <lb/>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are saturated fatty acids consisting of 1-6 carbon atoms in their chain length. They are the primary <lb/>byproducts of dietary fiber fermentation by Escherichia coli. Depending on different fiber content, approximately 500-600 mmol SCFAs <lb/>are produced daily in the intestine [22], with acetic acid, propionic acid (PA) and butyric acid being the most abundant among them <lb/>[23]. Large amounts of studies have demonstrated that SCFAs can upregulate tight junction protein expression and increase the <lb/>transmembrane electrical resistance (TEER) to enhance intestinal barrier function, regulate Th17/Treg balance in the colon, and <lb/>maintain immune homeostasis [24-27]. The interaction between SCFAs and gut-brain pathways can directly or indirectly modulate <lb/>physiological processes associated with neural function, learning, memory, and emotion [28]. Although PA is less abundant than acetic <lb/>acid in the intestine, some experiments have shown its effective inhibition of abnormal immune activation in both the intestine and <lb/>CNS. In Th17 cells specifically, PA inhibits IL-17A expression thereby ameliorating autoimmune inflammation within CNS. These <lb/>findings provide valuable insights into how PA regulates tolerance versus adverse immune reactions. <lb/>Our study aimed to investigate the potential of PA in regulating Th17 pathogenicity, reducing IL-17A secretion, and improving <lb/>neuroinflammation in PND model, with the goal of providing novel insights for PND prevention and treatment. <lb/>2. Materials and methods <lb/>2.1. Animals <lb/>Male Wistar rat about 12 months old were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University. Laboratory <lb/>conditions were maintained at 22 • C ± 2 • C with a relative humidity of 60 % ± 5 % and on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water are <lb/>plentiful for these animals. <lb/>2.2. Drugs <lb/>Rats were pretreated for 21 days with sodium propionate (150 mM) in the drinking water or pH and sodium-matched water, and <lb/>both were changed every three days [29]. <lb/>2.3. Exploratory laparotomy <lb/>The rat was placed in a transparent semi-closed respiratory loop box, which was prefilled with 7 % sevoflurane +30 % oxygen. <lb/></body>

			<body>When the righting reflex disappeared, the rat was placed in the right lateral position and the eyes were smeared with terramycin eye <lb/>ointment. The anesthetic concentration was adjusted to 3 % sevoflurane +30 % oxygen to maintain anesthesia. Apply lidocaine gel to <lb/>the wound for analgesia. After abdominal disinfection, a 5 cm long incision was made along the midline of the abdomen to explore the <lb/>abdominal organs in a clockwise direction slowly for 10 min, and to ensure that the direction of the intestines did not change to prevent <lb/>intestinal torsion. During the operation, part of the intestinal tract about 10 cm was carefully pulled out of the abdominal cavity, gently <lb/>squeezed with wet cotton swabs or gloves for 30-60 s. After the exploration, the muscle and skin were sutured with 5-0 and 4-0 sterile <lb/>silk threads, respectively. Finally, the rat was placed back in the home cage for recovering. A heating plate was used to maintain the <lb/>body temperature during operation and recovery period. <lb/>2.4. Behavioral tests <lb/>Open field test (OFT) was used to detect the motor ability of mice. The animals were placed in the center of the bottom of the box <lb/>(100 cm × 100 cm × 40 cm). The rats were allowed to explore freely for 10 min. The movement track was observed, and the moving <lb/>distance was recorded. The equipment of Y-maze test consisted of three equally long arms (50 cm × 10 cm × 8 cm) labeled A, B, and C. <lb/>The sequence of the animals entering each arm within 8 min was recorded. Alternation is defined as consecutive entry into three arms, <lb/>such as (ABC, BCA, or CAB). Then calculate the percentage = alternation/(sum of arm passes -2) × 100 %. The fear conditioning (FC) <lb/>test included training and test periods. Rats were placed into the Skinner box for 180 s and then received sound stimulation (80 dB, <lb/>3000 Hz) for 30 s. Foot shock (0.8 mA) was performed during the last 2 s of sound stimulation. Then the rats were returned to their <lb/>home cage. Contextual fear test was performed 24 h after training. The rats were placed into the Skinner box without any stimulus for <lb/>5 min. After 6 h, cued fear test was performed. The rats were placed into the Skinner box with deferent decoration and presented with <lb/>the same sound used in the training period for 3 min. Calculate the percentage of freezing time (the state without any other behavior <lb/>except respiratory movement) to observation time in each period. <lb/>2.5. Western blot <lb/>After extraction of hippocampal protein, loading 20 μg of protein into the 12.5 % SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. Then the <lb/>isolated protein was transferred to the PVDF membrane. After blocking the membrane with 5 % bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room <lb/>temperature (RT), the target protein was incubated with primary mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1:8000, Proteintech), rabbit anti-IL-<lb/>17A antibody (1:1000, Bioss), rabbit anti-IL-17RA antibody (1:1000, Abcam) overnight at 4 • C. The next day, the membranes were <lb/>washed with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT. Protein bands were then detected by chemiluminescence, <lb/>and the intensities were measured on ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA). <lb/>2.6. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) <lb/>Total RNA was hippocampus using Trizol reagent, according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Reverse tran-<lb/>scription to cDNA was performed using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR reagents (Vazyme, China). All gene transcripts were <lb/>analyzed using the SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme industry, China) and detected using an ABI 7500 fast instrument (Applied Bio-<lb/>systems, CA). The relative mRNA expression in each sample was displayed as 2 -ΔΔCT values and was representative of at least three <lb/>independent replicates. The following primer sequences were used for the real-time PCR analysis: <lb/>RORγt Forward: TGCAAGACTCATCGACAAGG. <lb/>Reverse: TCAGAGGGCTGAAGGAAGTAGA. <lb/>IL-17A Forward: ATTCCATCCATGTGCCTGAT. <lb/>Reverse: GAGTCCAGGGTGAAGTGGAA. <lb/>IL-1β Forward: GCAATGGTCGGGACATAGTT. <lb/>Reverse: GACTTGGCAGAGGACAAAGG. <lb/>IL-6 Forward: ACCACCCACAACAGACCAGT. <lb/>Reverse: AACGGAACTCCAGAAGACCA. <lb/>GAPDH Forward: TGTGAACGGATTTGGCCGTA. <lb/>Reverse: GATGGTGATGGGTTTCCCGT. <lb/>2.7. Immunofluorescence <lb/>After deep anesthesia with sevoflurane, the rats were perfused with precooled PBS and 4 % PFA. Brain tissue was immediately <lb/>collected, then fixed with 4 % PFA overnight and dehydrated with 30 % sucrose overnight at 4 • C. The collected specimens were cut <lb/>into 30 μm thick coronal sections. After rinsing with PBS, the brain slices were infiltrated with PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 (PBT) <lb/>for another 30 min, and then blocked with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Next, these brain slices were incubated with primary <lb/>antibodies (rabbit anti-Iba1, 1:500, Wako) at 4 • C. The next day, the secondary antibodies were incubated up for 2 h at RT. Nuclei were <lb/>stained with DAPI (Sigma). Finally, brain sections were photographed under Olympus laser confocal microscope and analyzed on <lb/>ImageJ. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.8. Statistics <lb/>GraphPad Prism 9.3 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Multiple-group comparisons <lb/>were performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests followed by Tukey&apos;s test. Unpaired two-tailed Student&apos;s t tests were <lb/>used for comparisons of two conditions. Pearson simple correlation and linear correlation were used to estimate the correlation be-<lb/>tween the two variables. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. P &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. Operation leads to cognitive impairment related to hippocampus in rats <lb/>We first performed exploratory laparotomy on rats in the LP: Veh group and evaluated whether their motor ability was affected by <lb/>OFT on POD3. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the total movement distance between Ctrl: Veh group and <lb/>LP: Veh group (Fig. 1A). Next, we evaluated the cognitive function of rats. The results of the Y-maze test showed that the working <lb/>memory ability of the rats in the LP: Veh group decreased as a percentage of the number of spontaneous alternations in the total <lb/>number of arm entry (Fig. 1B). FC test was conducted on POD4. There was no significant difference between the two groups at the <lb/>baseline level during the training phase (Fig. 1C). In contextual fear teat, the percentage of freezing time in the LP: Veh group was <lb/>significantly lower than that in the Ctrl: Veh group (Fig. 1D), while there was no difference between the two groups in the cued fear test <lb/>(Fig. 1E), indicating that the operation damaged the hippocampus related cognitive function. <lb/>3.2. PA preconditioning accelerates postoperative rehabilitation of PND rats and improves hippocampal cognitive dysfunction <lb/>To explore the therapeutic effect, we conducted PA pretreatment for 21 days in rats before operation. By monitoring the weight of <lb/>rats, we found that on the first day after operation, the weight of rats in the LP: Veh group and the LP: PA group decreased significantly <lb/>compared with the baseline before operation. On POD5, the weight of rats in the LP: PA group returned to the baseline level, while the <lb/>weight of rats in the LP: Veh group always showed a downward trend (Fig. 2A-C), indicating that PA, as an effective factor of intestinal <lb/>flora, may promote the recovery of intestinal function after operation. The results of OFT showed that the motor ability of the four <lb/>groups of rats was similar (Fig. 3A). On this basis, the cognitive function was further evaluated. The percentage of spontaneous <lb/>alternation in the Y-maze test of rats in LP: Veh group was significantly lower than that in Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group (Fig. 3B). <lb/>After fear conditioning training, the percentage of freezing time in the situational fear test of LP: Veh group was also significantly lower <lb/>Fig. 1.

			<body>than that in Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group; The percentage of spontaneous alternation and the percentage of freezing time of rats <lb/>in the LP: PA group were significantly higher than those in the Ctrl: Veh group and the Ctrl: PA group (Fig. 3C-F). Above results show <lb/>that PA pretreatment can prevent cognitive dysfunction caused by surgery. <lb/>3.3. PA preconditioning attenuates neuroinflammatory response in PND rats <lb/>Neuroinflammatory response is considered as one of the important mechanisms leading to PND. The results of RT-qPCR showed <lb/>that the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in hippocampus were up-regulated on POD1, while PA preconditioning significantly decreased the <lb/>expression of inflammatory factors (Fig. 4). The activation of microglia is one of the important signs of neuroinflammatory response. <lb/>After immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections of rat brain tissue, it was found that the quantity of Iba1 positive staining cells in <lb/>hippocampal CA1 region of LP: Veh group was significantly higher than that of Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group on POD1(Fig. 5A-B) <lb/>and POD5(Fig. 5C-D), accompanied by cell body thickening, which was partially reversed by PA pretreatment. These results suggest <lb/>that PA preconditioning can improve the cognitive impairment of PND rats by reducing postoperative neuroinflammatory response. <lb/>3.4. PA pretreatment reduced the infiltration of peripheral Th17 cells in the central nervous system and the level of IL-17A in the <lb/>hippocampus <lb/>To further explore the possible mechanism of PA pretreatment in reducing neuroinflammation, we first detected the expression of <lb/>Th17 cell-specific transcription factors and characteristic cytokines in the hippocampus at the transcriptional level. The results of RT-<lb/>qPCR showed that compared with Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group, the expression of RORγt mRNA and IL-17 mRNA in hippocampus <lb/>of LP: Veh group increased, while PA preconditioning decreased the expression of both on POD1(Fig. 6A) and POD5 (Fig. 6B). <lb/>Next, we detected the expression of major cytokines IL-17A in Th17 cells at the protein level. WB results showed that the hip-<lb/>pocampal IL-17A level in LP: Veh group was significantly higher than that in Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group, while the hippocampal <lb/>IL-17A level in LP: PA group was significantly lower than that in LP: Veh group on both POD1(Fig. 7A-C) and POD5 (Fig. 7B-D). <lb/>3.5. PA preconditioning down-regulates the expression of IL-17RA in hippocampus <lb/>Finally, we detected the level of IL-17RA in hippocampus. The results showed that the expression of IL-17RA in LP: Veh group was <lb/>significantly higher than that in Ctrl: Veh group and Ctrl: PA group, while that in LP: PA group was decreased (Fig. 8A-B).

			<body>impairment. We found that preoperative supplementation of PA promoted the recovery of intestinal function of rats after surgery. <lb/>More importantly, it alleviated neuroinflammation and hippocampus-dependent memory damage caused by surgical trauma, which <lb/>may be related to the regulatory effects of PA on Th17 cell-mediated function. By reducing the infiltration of Th17 cells in CNS as well <lb/>as lowering the expression of IL-17A and the activation of microglia mediated by IL-17A/IL-17RA, neurocognitive function could be <lb/>improved. <lb/>The induction of PND by exploratory laparotomy is a widely used research method [30-32] and highly reconstructs clinical sce-<lb/>narios. Therefore, we adopted this method to establish an animal model of PND. Our Y-maze and FC tests showed that exploratory <lb/>laparotomy resulted in significant cognitive impairment. The hippocampus dependent memory in rats is particularly sensitive to <lb/>surgical shocks [33-35], therefore, we chose the hippocampus as the target for molecular biology experimental analysis.

			<body>fear test, we observed that the percentage of freezing time in the LP: Veh group was significantly lower than that in the Ctrl: Veh group, <lb/>while the results in cued fear test were opposite. This may be due to cued fear is exclusively associated with the amygdala [36], while <lb/>contextual fear is strongly related to hippocampus and basolateral amygdala complex [37]. Hippocampus is also crucial to the gen-<lb/>eration of spontaneous alternation behavior. Research shows that hippocampal injury can reduce spontaneous alternation behavior <lb/>[38], but the enhancement of neuroplasticity or signal in the hippocampus can increase spontaneous alternation behavior [39]. Our <lb/>Y-maze test results indicated that PA pretreatment can improve the reduction of spontaneous alternation behavior caused by surgery. <lb/>Microglia are innate immune cells in the CNS, accounting for 10-15 % of glia [40]. They are involved in the development of CNS <lb/>and help maintain dynamic equilibrium of tissues by supporting neuron survival, cell death and synapse formation [41]. Surgery may <lb/>activate the originally silent microglia and promote the release of inflammatory factors into CNS, thus triggering neuroinflammation. It <lb/>is reported that inhibiting microglia can reduce the level of IL-1β and IL-6, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and enhancing <lb/>neurocognitive function [42]. IL-1β plays an important role in PND, and the innate immune response induced by peripheral surgery <lb/>triggers IL-1β in the hippocampus mediated inflammatory processes, which is one of the foundations of cognitive impairment [43,44]. <lb/>Our results showed that PA pretreatment inhibited the activation of microglia and the expression of these inflammatory factors, <lb/>thereby improving the cognitive function damage caused by neuroinflammation. <lb/>Among the six isoforms of IL-17, no other subtypes have been found to be expressed or related signaling pathways in CNS except IL-<lb/>17A [45]. In vivo and in vitro experiments show that Th17 cells can infiltrate into the brain [46,47], while IL-17A can destroy the <lb/>blood-brain barrier (BBB) [48]. Intrathecal injection of Aβ-42 peptides was used to establish an AD rat model, and it was found that <lb/>after Th17 cells entered the central nervous system, the permeability of BBB increased, and the levels of IL-17A and RORγt in the <lb/>hippocampus, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum increased [49]. With the destruction of BBB integrity, more Th17 cells migrate to brain <lb/>parenchyma, producing more IL-17A and leading to serious neuronal dysfunction [50,51]. The presence of Th17 cells in CNS promotes <lb/>the activation of astrocyte and microglia and amplifies neuroinflammation by targeting resident glia cells [52,53]. Neutralizing IL-17A <lb/>can slow down the progress of neuroinflammation by reducing the production of pathogenic cytokines. Studies have shown that the <lb/>addition of IL-17A to the co-culture of microglia and neurons can cause the activation of microglia and the death of neurons. Inter-<lb/>estingly, only when microglia exist, IL-17A can aggravate the loss of neurons, while inhibiting the IL-17A receptor on microglia <lb/>weakens these effects [54]. There may be some communication network between glia and Th17 cells, and in-depth understanding of <lb/>this interaction may provide a new therapeutic approach for neuroinflammation. <lb/>Microbial host communication is currently receiving increasing attention, particularly the bidirectional communication between <lb/>the gut microbiota and CNS, known as the gut-brain axis [55,56]. The communication between gut and brain can be established <lb/>through the modulation of metabolites on BBB and the systemic immune effect mediated by the intestinal endocrine factors and <lb/>microbial metabolites (such as SCFAs, tryptophan metabolites, phytoestrogen and bile acid metabolites) [57]. SCFAs are a diverse class <lb/>of metabolites generated through the fermentation of dietary fiber by the gut microbiota. Acetic acid, propionic acid (PA), and butyric <lb/>acid represent the most abundant SCFAs, with molar ratios of 60:20:20 [58]. Numerous in vitro [59-61], in vivo [62,63] and clinical <lb/>[64-66] studies have semonstrated the regulatory role of propionic acid on T cells. Exogenous supplementation of PA can increase the <lb/>activity and quantity of Treg cells while reducing the quantity of Th17 cells and inhibiting their pathogenicity. Additionally, it slightly <lb/>suppresses Th1 cells by inhibiting histone deacetylase [67]. A consistent finding among studies investigating the microbiota <lb/>composition in MS patients is a decrease in the populations of bacteria that produce SCFAs [68-70], suggesting potential physiological <lb/>implications. Further clinical studies have revealed lower levels of PA in both feces and plasma of MS patients compared to healthy <lb/>controls [71-74]; however the correlation between acetic acid and butyric acid is weak. Similarly, reduced SCFAs levels were observed <lb/>in the serum of PD patients compared with healthy controls; notably, only PA level exhibited correlations with the Unified Parkinson&apos;s <lb/>Disease Rating Scale (UPDRs) part III score, Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) <lb/>score [75]. Surgical interventions significantly decreased gut microbiota production of SCFAs in mice according to animal experiments <lb/>[76]. Furthermore, a separate animal study has confirmed that PA exerted neuroprotective effects on streptozocin (STZ)-induced type <lb/>1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mice through modulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase <lb/>Fig. 8.

			<body>(Akt)/endothelial nitrogen monoxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway [77]. However, the impact of PA on PND remains ambig-<lb/>uous, and preliminary exploration efforts have been conducted, constituting the novelty of this study. <lb/>This study has several limitations: Firstly, the concentration of PA in CNS was not detected. Secondly, an experimental group <lb/>receiving intrathecal injection of IL-17A neutralizing antibody as a parallel control for assessing the therapeutic effect of PA was not <lb/>included. In addition, further investigation using Th17 cells-knockout mice is necessary to elucidate the role of Th17 cells in the <lb/>occurrence and development of PND. In the future, we will continue to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects and mechanisms <lb/>underlying PA in PND with the aim of translating relevant research findings into clinical practice. <lb/>5. Conclusion <lb/>In summary, our study suggests a significant decrease in the intestinal content of PA in PND rats. Preconditioning with PA alleviated <lb/>postoperative neuroinflammation and enhanced cognitive function in rats. This mechanism may be attributed to the regulatory effects <lb/>of PA on Th17 cell-mediated immune function. Our findings present a novel therapeutic strategy for treating neuroinflammation-<lb/>induced cognitive impairment. However, further investigations employing advanced tools such as chemical genetics or optogenetic <lb/>manipulations are warranted to validate our findings. <lb/>Ethics statement <lb/>This experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University (No. <lb/>IACUC-2102026). All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In <lb/>Vivo Experiments) and the National Research Council&apos;s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. <lb/></body>
