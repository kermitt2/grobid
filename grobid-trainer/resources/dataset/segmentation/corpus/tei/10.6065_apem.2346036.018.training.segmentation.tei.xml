			<front>Original article <lb/>Purpose: The impacts of growth restriction and programming in the fetal stage on <lb/>metabolic and bone health in children and adolescents are poorly understood. <lb/>Moreover, there is insufficient evidence for the relationship between current <lb/>growth status and metabolic components. Herein, we compared the growth status, <lb/>metabolic and body compositions, and bone mineral density in Korean children <lb/>and adolescents based on birth weight at gestational age. <lb/>Methods: We studied 1,748 subjects (272 small for gestational age [SGA], 1,286 <lb/>appropriate for gestational age [AGA], and 190 large for gestational age [LGA]; <lb/>931 men and 817 women) aged 10-18 years from the Korean National Health <lb/>and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V (2010-2011). Anthropometric <lb/>measurements, fasting blood biochemistry, and body composition data were <lb/>analyzed according to birth weight and gestational age. <lb/>Results: The prevalence of low birth weight (14.7% vs. 1.2% in AGA and 3.2% in LGA, <lb/>P&lt;0.001) and current short stature (2.237 [1.296-3.861] compared to AGA, P=0.004) <lb/>in SGA subjects was greater than that in other groups; however, the prevalence of <lb/>overweight and obesity risks, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and MetS component <lb/>abnormalities was not. Moreover, no significant differences were found in age-and <lb/>sex-adjusted lean mass ratio, fat mass ratio, truncal fat ratio, bone mineral content, <lb/>or bone density among the SGA, AGA, and LGA groups in Korean children and <lb/>adolescents. <lb/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that birth weight alone may not be a <lb/>determining factor for body composition and bone mass in Korean children and <lb/>adolescents. Further prospective and longitudinal studies in adults are necessary to <lb/>confirm the impact of SGA on metabolic components and bone health. <lb/>Keywords: Small for gestational age, Obesity, Metabolic syndrome <lb/>©2024 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism <lb/>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http:// <lb/>creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any <lb/>medium, provided the original work is properly cited. <lb/>ISSN: 2287-1012(Print) <lb/>ISSN: 2287-1292(Online) <lb/>Highlights <lb/>• We studied whether the impact of birth weight on current growth, metabolic alterations, <lb/>body composition, and bone mineral density in korean children and adolescents. <lb/>• Children and adolescents born small for gestational age had increased risk of short stature <lb/>and underweight, not metabolic component abnormalities, compared to those born <lb/>appropriate gestational age. <lb/>• The birth weight at gestational age alone may not be a determinant factor for the <lb/>Comparison of anthropometric, metabolic, and body <lb/>compositional abnormalities in Korean children <lb/>and adolescents born small, appropriate, and large <lb/>for gestational age: a population-based study from <lb/>KNHANES V (2010-2011) <lb/>Tae Kwan Lee 1 , <lb/>Yoo Mi Kim 2,3 , <lb/>Han Hyuk Lim 1,2 <lb/>1 Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam <lb/>National University Hospital, Daejeon, <lb/>Korea <lb/>2 Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam <lb/>National University College of Medi <lb/>cine, Daejeon, Korea <lb/>3 Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam <lb/>National University Sejong Hospital, <lb/>Sejong, Korea <lb/>Received: 14 February, 2023 <lb/>Revised: 27 March, 2023 <lb/>Accepted: 17 May, 2023 <lb/>Address for correspondence: <lb/>Han Hyuk Lim <lb/>Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam <lb/>National University Hospital, Depart <lb/>ment of Pediatrics, Chungnam <lb/>National University College of Medi <lb/>cine, 282, Munhwaro, Junggu, <lb/>Daejeon, 35015, Korea <lb/>Email: damus@cnuh.co.kr <lb/>https://orcid.org/000000025297 <lb/>5913 <lb/>https://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2346044.022 <lb/>Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2024;29:2937 <lb/></front>

			<front>achievement of body composition and bone mass for <lb/>growing Korean children and adolescents. Rather, current <lb/>body weight could be more important. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are known <lb/>to have long-term metabolic effects. Many studies have <lb/>demonstrated that weight gain during the fetal, perinatal, and <lb/>infant periods is associated with cardiometabolic parameters <lb/>in childhood and adolescents. Intrauterine growth restriction <lb/>and fetal programming are known to influence cardiometabolic <lb/>health in childhood and adolescents. In observational studies <lb/>of adults, a larger number of metabolic abnormalities, such as <lb/>hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, have been observed in <lb/>individuals born SGA. 1-4) Furthermore, during the last decade, <lb/>the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) has increased <lb/>with increasing calorie-dense food intake in Korean children <lb/>and adolescents. 5) <lb/>A few studies have revealed that the SGA group with obesity <lb/>has more severe problems with obesity than the non-SGA <lb/>group, even with the same state of high body mass index (BMI), <lb/>suggesting that birth weight has an impact on adult bone mass. <lb/>Some studies showed that birth weight is positively associated <lb/>with greater bone mineral content (BMC). In SGA infants, rapid <lb/>postnatal catch-up growth is a risk factor for many problems, <lb/>such as body composition alteration, later obesity, and MetS. <lb/>Both children born SGA and large for gestational age (LGA) <lb/>have obesity and obesity-related morbidities; however, the <lb/>evidence for whether this association is only mediated by <lb/>adiposity is conflicting. 6,7) <lb/>In growing children, there are little data on the relationship <lb/>between current growth status and metabolic components based <lb/>on birth weight at gestational age. The potential impact of birth <lb/>size on bone accrual and its interaction with body composition <lb/>in SGA children is under debate. Several studies have revealed <lb/>that, compared to children born appropriate for gestational age <lb/>(AGA), SGA infants are lighter and have less body fat. However, <lb/>other studies have shown that SGA individuals are more likely <lb/>to experience obesity during childhood, particularly when they <lb/>exhibit catch-up growth. Stefan et al. found that the known <lb/>cardiovascular risks among infants born SGA, AGA, and LGA <lb/>are not reflected in metabolic consequences at the ages of 6-12 <lb/>years. 8,9) <lb/>In this study, we examined the effect of birth weight at <lb/>gestational age on current growth, metabolic alterations, bone <lb/>mineral density (BMD), and body composition in children and <lb/>adolescents using Korean population data. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>1. Subjects <lb/>This study used data from the Korean National Health and <lb/>Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V (2010-2011). <lb/>The KNHANES is a nationally representative, periodically <lb/>conducted, cross-sectional survey conducted by the Division <lb/>of Chronic Disease Surveillance of the Korea Centers for <lb/>Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Ministry of <lb/>Health and Welfare (https://knhanes.kdca.go.kr/). Procedures <lb/>performed in the KNHANES adhered to ethical guidelines. In <lb/>total, 2,018 children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were <lb/>enrolled. Among the participants, 270 participants without <lb/>anthropometric or laboratory data were excluded. A total <lb/>of 1,748 participants (931 men and 817 women) finally was <lb/>included in the analysis, representing the total population of <lb/>4,328,424 individuals aged 10-18 years in Korea. Subjects <lb/>were categorized into 3 groups according to birth weight by <lb/>gestational age (BWGA) and sex based on a study using Korean <lb/>statistics 10) and by definition 11) : SGA (BWGA &lt; 10th percentile), <lb/>AGA (10th percentile ≤ BWGA ≤ 90th percentile), and LGA <lb/>(BWGA &gt; 90th percentile). <lb/>2. Data collection <lb/>Demographic characteristics were age, sex, height, weight, <lb/>BMI, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), birth <lb/>weight, gestational age, delivery type, household income, <lb/>physical activity, current smoking and alcohol status, and daily <lb/>calorie and food intake. The percentiles of height, weight, <lb/>BMI, WC, and BP were calculated based on the 2007 Korean <lb/>National Growth Chart. 12) Household income was stratified <lb/>into quartiles as 1-4. Physical activity was defined as moderate <lb/>or vigorous exercise. Dietary data were evaluated via a 24-hour <lb/>recall nutrition survey. Biochemical samples were obtained <lb/>after ≥8 hours of fasting. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid <lb/>profiles, and liver enzyme levels were measured using a Hitachi <lb/>Automatic Analyzer 7600 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Fasting <lb/>insulin levels were evaluated using an immunoradiometric <lb/>assay (INS-IRMA; Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium) with a 1470 <lb/>Wizard gamma counter (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). The <lb/>homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-<lb/>IR) result was assessed as follows: fasting insulin (mU/L) × FPG <lb/>(mmol/L)/22.5. <lb/>Body composition and BMD were measured using whole-<lb/>body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with a QDR Discovery <lb/>fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). <lb/>BMD z-scores for the lumbar spine (LS), femur neck (FN), and <lb/>whole bone except the head (WB) were calculated according to <lb/>the reference values for Korean children and adolescents. 12,13) <lb/>3. Definition of the metabolic component abnormalities <lb/>and MetS in children and adolescents <lb/>Underweight status was defined as BMI &lt;10th percentile by <lb/>age and sex, while overweight and obesity were defined as 85th <lb/>percentile ≤BMI &lt;95th percentile and BMI ≥95th percentile, <lb/>respectively. For diagnosis of MetS in Korean children and <lb/>adolescents, both the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) <lb/>and the modified National Cholesterol Education Program-<lb/>Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria were used. 14) <lb/></body>

            <body>For diagnosing MetS, the IDF criteria includes central obesity <lb/>(WC ≥90 cm in boys or ≥80 cm in girls or ≥90th percentile) <lb/>and at least 2 of the following characteristics: (1) triglyceride <lb/>(TG) level ≥150 mg/dL; (2) high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-<lb/>cholesterol level ≤40 mg/dL (or, in adolescents aged &gt;16 years, <lb/>≤40 mg/dL in boys and ≤50 mg/dL in girls); (3) systolic BP <lb/>≥130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg; and (4) FPG ≥100 <lb/>mg/dL. For diagnosing MetS, the modified NCEP-ATP-III <lb/>criteria include the presence of 3 or more of the following <lb/>characteristics: (1) WC ≥90th percentile; (2) TG ≥110 mg/dL; <lb/>(3) HDL cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL; (4) systolic BP or diastolic BP <lb/>≥ 90th percentile; and (5) FPG ≥110 mg/dL. 15) The metabolic <lb/>abnormality score was calculated as a total score of 5 points <lb/>across the 5 parameters (central obesity, high TG, low HDL-C, <lb/>high BP, high FPG), with each contributing 1 point. <lb/>4. Statistical analyses <lb/>For continuous variables, the numerical data are presented <lb/>as mean±standard deviation, while categorical variables are <lb/>presented as percentage and frequency. One-way analysis of <lb/>variance with post hoc analysis (Tukey test) and the chi-square <lb/>test were used to identify significant differences among the <lb/>3 groups (SGA, AGA, and LGA).

            <body>analysis was used to assess the odds ratios (ORs) of the <lb/>prevalence of short stature, underweight status, and metabolic <lb/>changes in the SGA and LGA groups compared to the AGA <lb/>group. Graphs were arranged using GraphPad Prism version 6 <lb/>for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). <lb/>IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was <lb/>used to analyze data, and P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically <lb/>significant. <lb/>5. Ethical statement <lb/>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of <lb/>Chungnam National University Hospital (approval No. 2023-<lb/>02-096). <lb/>Results <lb/>1. Clinical and laboratory characteristics <lb/>Anthropometric and laboratory characteristics are summari-<lb/>zed in Table 1. The prevalence rates of SGA, AGA, and LGA <lb/>were 15.5% (n=272), 73.6% (n=1,286), and 10.9% (n=190), <lb/>respectively. In the SGA group, the height, weight, BMI, WC, <lb/>birth weight, and gestational age were significantly less than <lb/>those in the AGA or LGA groups. However, age, sex, BP, lipid <lb/>profile, alanine transaminase, fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-<lb/>IR score, maternal age, delivery type, socioeconomic status, <lb/>physical activity, lifestyle behaviors, and food intake were not <lb/>significantly different among the 3 groups. <lb/>2. Comparison of current growth status according to <lb/>BWGA <lb/>The prevalence rates of short stature (height &lt;3rd percentile) <lb/>and near-short stature (height &lt;10th percentile) in children and <lb/>adolescents born SGA were 2.6% and 9.2%, respectively, which <lb/>were higher than those in subjects born AGA (1.0%, P=0.187; <lb/>3.7%, P&lt;0.001, respectively) or LGA (0%, P=0.045; 1.6%, <lb/>P&lt;0.001). 16) In the case of height &lt;10th percentile, SGA births <lb/>were most common at 9.2%, while AGA births composed 2.7% <lb/>and LGA births composed 1.6% of all individuals with height <lb/>&lt;10th percentile (P&lt;0.001). The prevalence of underweight <lb/>in those born SGA (16.5%) was also greater than that of those <lb/>born AGA (10.3%, P=0.009) or LGA (9.5%, P=0.046) (Fig. 1A). <lb/>However, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not <lb/>significantly different among subjects born SGA, AGA, and <lb/>LGA (Fig. 1B). <lb/>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate <lb/>the risk of current short stature or underweight according to <lb/>BWGA. Children and adolescents born SGA had increased risk <lb/>of short stature (OR, 2.237; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.296-<lb/>3.861; P=0.004), underweight (OR, 1.669; 95%, CI 1.133-2.458; <lb/>P=0.010), and short stature with underweight (OR, 4.376; 95% <lb/>CI, 1.317-14.542; P=0.016) compared to those born AGA, after <lb/>adjusting for confounding factors (Table 2). <lb/>3. Comparison of metabolic abnormalities according <lb/>to BWGA in children and adolescents with/without <lb/>overweight or obesity <lb/>The metabolic abnormality score and the prevalence of <lb/>metabolic component abnormalities and MetS did not differ <lb/>significantly among subjects born SGA, AGA, or LGA (Fig. 2A1, <lb/>A2).

            <body>Discussion <lb/>This study revealed that (1) children and adolescents born <lb/>SGA had increased risk of short stature, underweight and short <lb/>stature with underweight compared to those born AGA; (2) the <lb/>metabolic abnormality score and the prevalence of metabolic <lb/>component abnormalities and MetS did not differ significantly <lb/>among subjects born SGA, AGA or LGA; and (3) there was no <lb/>significant difference in body composition or bone density in <lb/>Korean children and adolescents among the groups. <lb/>Our study examined anthropometric measures and growth <lb/>status, metabolic and body component proportions, and BMD <lb/>among Korean children and adolescents born SGA, AGA, <lb/>and LGA from Korean population data. The prevalence rates <lb/>of SGA, AGA, and LGA births were 15.5%, 73.6%, and 10.9%, <lb/>respectively, which are similar to those in other countries (e.g., <lb/>the United States, Norway). 17,18) <lb/>A significant risk factor for onset of MetS is low birth weight, <lb/>which increases the risk of morbidity in adulthood. Byberg <lb/>et al. 19) observed that BWGA has a negative association <lb/>insulin resistance, truncal fat, and hypertension over a long-<lb/>term period. In another study, no correlations were found <lb/>between low birth weight and MetS in children and young <lb/>adults. 20,21) Height and weight at birth were positively correlated <lb/>with adult height and weight; however, only a weak correlation <lb/>was observed for BMI and waist/hip ratio. 22,23) <lb/>In the current study, we found no significant differences in <lb/>the prevalence of metabolic abnormality scores, component <lb/>abnormalities, or MetS. Moreover, we found no differences <lb/>in BWGA in the overweight and obesity groups. Our results <lb/>showed that SGA with obesity did not induce larger increased <lb/>metabolic alterations with obesity than AGA or LGA in Korean <lb/>children and adolescents. There is a need for additional research <lb/>on the association between low birth weight and metabolic risk. <lb/>Being born SGA may facilitate excessive abdominal fat <lb/>accumulation in children and could be a significant factor of <lb/>MetS. These children have less subcutaneous fat but the same <lb/>amount of visceral fat as AGA children, with an increased <lb/>ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat. 24-27) SGA individuals had <lb/>significantly more total abdominal fat mass along with higher <lb/>proportions of truncal and abdominal fat mass. 28) Some studies <lb/>have revealed that adiposity in SGA subjects is the adaptive <lb/>mechanism to increase energy balance or leptin resistance. 29) <lb/>LGA infants are more likely to become overweight or obese <lb/>children, adolescents, and young adults. They also have an <lb/>increased risk of MetS in later life. Despite their larger bodies, <lb/>children born LGA have a balanced body composition and fat <lb/>distribution. Conversely, regardless of body size, children born <lb/>SGA have increased central adiposity. 30) <lb/>However, from studies on the correlation <lb/>Table 3.

            <body>between BWGA and current fat mass in adolescents and young <lb/>adults are conflicting. Several studies have reported a correlation <lb/>between birth weight for gestational age and childhood body fat <lb/>in adolescents and young adults. 31,32) Meanwhile, other studies <lb/>have revealed a negative association. 33,34) It is unclear whether <lb/>such a correlation might be the result of rapid postnatal catch-<lb/>up growth, a low birth weight, or the combination of the two. <lb/>In the current study comparing body composition, our data <lb/>showed that body composition, including lean mass ratio, fat <lb/>mass ratio, and truncal fat ratio, did not significantly differ <lb/>according to BWGA. A study on Brazilian adolescents reported <lb/>an association between fat mass and postnatal weight gain. 35) <lb/>Leunissen et al. 36) reported that childhood weight gain is a <lb/>significant factor in young adult body composition, but that <lb/>birth size is less important. The heterogeneity of the SGA group <lb/>might be a contributing factor to the discrepancy between these <lb/>results. <lb/>In preterm and SGA children, low birth weight negatively <lb/>influences BMD and BMC. In AGA infants, postnatal growth <lb/>patterns have been linked to bone mineral accumulation. 37,38) <lb/>However, the effect of catch-up growth in infancy on bone <lb/>accumulation in SGA infants has not been consistently studied. <lb/>Previous studies on SGA bone health have suggested that SGA <lb/>infants born with rapid catch-up growth encounter negative <lb/>effects of bone development. BMD accrual during infancy and <lb/>later was correlated with the rates of free fat mass, fat mass, and <lb/>weight gain during first month of life. It remains unknown <lb/>whether birth size is always a major component of bone mass in <lb/>adolescence and later life, though fat mass and postnatal growth <lb/>are normal. 39) Deodati et al. 40) suggested that SGA children with <lb/>compensatory catch-up growth achieve body composition and <lb/>bone mass similar to those born AGA. <lb/>In our study, we recorded no significant differences in age-<lb/>and sex-adjusted lean body mass ratio, fat mass ratio, truncal <lb/>fat ratio, BMC, and bone density in Korean children and <lb/>adolescents between the SGA, AGA, and LGA groups. Our data <lb/>demonstrated that birth weight at gestational age alone might <lb/>not be a determining factor for body composition and bone <lb/>density during growth in Korean children and adolescents. <lb/>Therefore, we suggest that current low body weight and short <lb/>stature may be more important factors than birth size, affecting <lb/>bone health in the AGA, LGA, and SGA groups. <lb/>This investigation was a cross-sectional study conducted only <lb/>from 2010-2011 and had limitations, as information on sexual <lb/>maturity, catch-up growth, bone age, and genetic background <lb/>was not provided and is subject to recall bias of dietary records. <lb/>Although it is strengthened by a large-scale nationwide study, <lb/>it has other limitations because studies conducted periodically <lb/>have not been merged. <lb/>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that birth weight at <lb/>gestational age alone may not determine body composition, <lb/>including metabolic alterations and bone density, during growth <lb/>in Korean children and adolescents. Rather, current body <lb/>weight could be more important. It is advised that SGA children <lb/>should be regularly followed up by pediatricians to monitor <lb/>catch-up growth, body composition, and metabolic parameters. <lb/>Prospective longitudinal studies in childhood and adolescence <lb/>are necessary to confirm the impact of SGA on metabolic <lb/>components and bone health. Overall, our study could help <lb/>support the effective management of SGA infants for better <lb/>long-term metabolic consequences. <lb/></body>
