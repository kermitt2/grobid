			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>In B 0 <lb/>s decays some final states can be reached either by a di-<lb/>rect decay amplitude or via a mixing amplitude. For the case of <lb/>B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ decays, the interference between these two ampli-<lb/>tudes allows observation of a CP violating phase. In the Stan-<lb/>dard Model (SM) this phase is −2β s = −0.036 +0.0020 <lb/>−0.0016 radians, <lb/>where β s = arg(−V ts V * <lb/>tb /V cs V * <lb/>cb ), and the V ij are CKM matrix el-<lb/>ements [1]. This is about 20 times smaller in magnitude than the <lb/>measured value of the corresponding phase 2β in B 0 mixing. Be-<lb/>ing small, this phase can be drastically increased by the presence <lb/>of new particles beyond the SM. Thus, measuring β s is an impor-<lb/>tant probe of new physics. <lb/>Attempts to determine β s have been made by the CDF and D0 <lb/>experiments at the Tevatron using the B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ decay mode [2]. <lb/>While initial results hinted at possible large deviations from the <lb/>SM, recent measurements are more consistent [3,4]. However, the <lb/>Tevatron limits are still not very constraining. Since the final state <lb/>consists of two spin-1 particles, it is not a CP eigenstate. While <lb/>it is well known that CP violation can be measured using angular <lb/>analyses [5], this requires more events to gain similar sensitivi-<lb/>ties to those obtained if the decay proceeds via only CP-even or <lb/>CP-odd channels. In Ref. [6] it is argued that in the case of J /ψφ <lb/>the analysis is complicated by the presence of an S-wave K + K − <lb/>system interfering with the φ that must be taken into account, <lb/>and that this S-wave would also manifest itself by the appearance <lb/>of f 0 (980) → π + π − decays. This decay B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψ f 0 (980) is to a <lb/>single CP-odd eigenstate and does not require an angular analysis. <lb/>Its CP violating phase in the Standard Model is −2β s (up to correc-<lb/>✩ © CERN, for the benefit of the LHCb Collaboration. <lb/>Fig. 1. Decay diagram for B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψ( f 0 or φ) decays. <lb/>tions due to higher order diagrams). In what follows, we use the <lb/>notation f 0 to refer to the f 0 (980) state. <lb/>By comparing D + <lb/>s → f 0 π + decays where the f 0 was detected <lb/>in both K + K − and π + π − modes it was predicted that [6] <lb/>R f 0 /φ ≡ <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψ f 0 , f 0 → π + π − ) <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ, φ → K + K − ) <lb/>≈ 20%. <lb/>(1) <lb/>A decay rate at this level would make these events very useful for <lb/>measuring β s if backgrounds are not too large. <lb/>The dominant decay diagram for these processes is shown in <lb/>Fig. 1. It is important to realize that the ss system accompanying <lb/>the J /ψ is an isospin singlet (isoscalar), and thus cannot produce a <lb/>single meson that is anything but isospin zero. Thus, for example, <lb/>in this spectator model production of a ρ 0 meson is forbidden. The <lb/>dominant low mass isoscalar resonance decaying into π + π − is the <lb/>f 0 (980) but other higher mass objects are possible. <lb/>Although the f 0 mass is relatively well estimated at 980 ± <lb/>10 MeV (we use units with c = 1) by the PDG, the width is poorly <lb/>known. Its measurement appears to depend on the final state, and <lb/>is complicated by the opening of the K K channel close to the <lb/>pole; the PDG estimates 40-100 MeV [11]. Recently CLEO mea-<lb/>sured these properties in the semileptonic decay D + <lb/>s → f 0 e + ν, <lb/>where hadronic effects are greatly reduced, determining a width <lb/>of (91 +30 <lb/>−22 ± 3) MeV [12]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 2. The μ + μ − invariant mass for candidates satisfying the trigger and analysis <lb/>requirements and having t z &gt; 0.5 ps. The data points are shown as circles; the error <lb/>bars are smaller than the circle radii. The dashed line shows the Crystal Ball signal <lb/>function [10], the dotted line the background and the solid line the sum. <lb/>2. Data sample and analysis requirements <lb/>We use a data sample of approximately 33 pb −1 collected with <lb/>the LHCb detector in 2010 [7]. The detector elements are placed <lb/>along the beam line of the LHC starting with the Vertex Locator <lb/>(VELO), a silicon strip device that surrounds the proton-proton in-<lb/>teraction region and is positioned 8 mm from the beam during <lb/>collisions. It provides precise locations for primary pp interaction <lb/>vertices, the locations of decays of long-lived particles, and con-<lb/>tributes to the measurement of track momenta. Other devices used <lb/>to measure track momenta comprise a large area silicon strip de-<lb/>tector (TT) located in front of a 3.7 Tm dipole magnet, and a <lb/>combination of silicon strip detectors (IT) and straw drift chambers <lb/>(OT) placed behind. Two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors <lb/>are used to identify charged hadrons. Further downstream an Elec-<lb/>tromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is used for photon detection and <lb/>electron identification, followed by a Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL), <lb/>and a system consisting of alternating layers of iron and chambers <lb/>(MWPC and triple-GEM) that distinguishes muons from hadrons <lb/>(MUON). The ECAL, MUON, and HCAL provide the capability of <lb/>first-level hardware triggering. <lb/>This analysis is restricted to events accepted by a J /ψ → <lb/>μ + μ − trigger. Subsequent analysis selection criteria are applied <lb/>that serve to reject background, yet preserve high efficiencies on <lb/>both the J /ψπ + π − and J /ψ K + K − final states, as determined by <lb/>Monte Carlo events generated using PYTHIA [8], and LHCb detector <lb/>simulation based on GEANT4 [9]. Tracks are reconstructed as de-<lb/>scribed in Ref. [7]. To be considered as a J /ψ → μ + μ − candidate <lb/>opposite sign tracks are required to have transverse momentum, <lb/>p T , greater than 500 MeV, be identified as muons, and form a com-<lb/>mon vertex with fit χ 2 per number of degrees of freedom (ndof) <lb/>less than 11. The μ + μ − invariant mass distribution is shown in <lb/>Fig. 2 with an additional requirement, used only for this plot, that <lb/>the pseudo proper-time, t z , be greater than 0.5 ps, where t z is <lb/>the distance that the J /ψ candidate travels downstream parallel <lb/>to the beam, along z, times the known J /ψ mass divided by the z <lb/>component of the candidate&apos;s momentum. The data are fit with a <lb/>Crystal Ball signal function [10] to account for the radiative tail <lb/>towards low mass, and a linear background function. There are <lb/>549,000 ± 1100 J /ψ signal events in the entire mass range. For <lb/>subsequent use only candidates within ±48 MeV of the known <lb/>J /ψ mass are selected. <lb/>Pion and kaon candidates are selected if they are inconsistent <lb/>with having been produced at the closest primary vertex. The im-<lb/>pact parameter (IP) is the minimum distance of approach of the <lb/>track with respect to the primary vertex. We require that the χ 2 <lb/>formed by using the hypothesis that the IP is equal to zero be &gt; 9 <lb/>Fig. 3. The invariant mass of J /ψ K + K − combinations when the K + K − pair is re-<lb/>quired to be with ±20 MeV of the φ mass. The data have been fit with a Gaussian <lb/>signal function whose mass and width are allowed to float and linear background <lb/>function shown as a dashed line. The solid curve shows the sum. <lb/>for each track. For further consideration these tracks must be pos-<lb/>itively identified in the RICH system. Particles forming opposite-<lb/>sign di-pion candidates must have their scalar sum p T &gt; 900 MeV, <lb/>while those forming opposite-sign di-kaon candidates must have <lb/>their vector sum p T &gt; 1000 MeV, and have an invariant mass <lb/>within ±20 MeV of the φ mass. <lb/>To select B 0 <lb/>s candidates we further require that the two pions <lb/>or kaons form a vertex with a χ 2 &lt; 10, that they form a candidate <lb/>B 0 <lb/>s vertex with the J /ψ where the vertex fit χ 2 /ndof &lt; 5, and <lb/>that this B 0 <lb/>s candidate points to the primary vertex at an angle not <lb/>different from its momentum direction by more than 0.68 • . <lb/>Simulations are used to evaluate our detection efficiencies. For <lb/>the J /ψφ final state we use the measured decay parameters from <lb/>CDF [3]. The J /ψ f 0 final state is simulated using full longitudinal <lb/>polarization of the J /ψ meson. The efficiencies of having all four <lb/>decay tracks in the geometric acceptance and satisfying the trigger, <lb/>track reconstruction and data selection requirements are (1.471 ± <lb/>0.024)% for J /ψ f 0 , requiring the π + π − invariant mass be within <lb/>±500 MeV of 980 MeV, and (1.454 ± 0.021)% for J /ψφ, having <lb/>the K + K − invariant mass be within ±20 MeV of the φ mass. The <lb/>uncertainties on the efficiency estimates are statistical only. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>The J /ψ K + K − invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 3. <lb/>The di-muon invariant mass has been constrained to have the <lb/>known value of the J /ψ mass; this is done for all subsequent B 0 <lb/>s <lb/>invariant mass distributions. The data are fit with a Gaussian sig-<lb/>nal function and a linear background function. The fit gives a B 0 <lb/>s <lb/>mass of 5366.7 ± 0.4 MeV, a width of 7.4 MeV r.m.s., and a yield <lb/>of 635 ± 26 events. <lb/>Initially, to search for a f 0 (980) signal we restrict ourselves <lb/>to an interval of ±90 MeV around the f 0 mass, approximately <lb/>two full f 0 widths [12]. The B 0 <lb/>s candidate invariant mass distri-<lb/>bution for selected J /ψπ + π − combinations is shown in Fig. 4. <lb/>The signal is fit with a Gaussian whose mean and width are al-<lb/>lowed to float. We also include a background component due to <lb/>B 0 → J /ψπ + π − that is taken to be Gaussian, with mass allowed <lb/>to float in the fit, but whose width is constrained to be the same <lb/>as the B 0 <lb/>s signal. Other components in the fit are B 0 → J /ψ K * 0 , <lb/>combinatorial background taken to have an exponential shape, <lb/>B + → J /ψ K + (or π + ), and other specific B 0 <lb/>s decay backgrounds <lb/>including B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψη , η → ργ , B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ, φ → π + π − π 0 . The <lb/>shape of the sum of the combinatorial and B + → J /ψ K + (π + ) <lb/>components is taken from the like-sign events. The shapes of the <lb/>other components are taken from Monte Carlo simulation with <lb/>their normalizations allowed to float. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 4. (a) The invariant mass of J /ψπ + π − combinations when the π + π − pair <lb/>is required to be with ±90 MeV of the f 0 (980) mass. The data have been fit <lb/>with a signal Gaussian and several background functions. The thin (red) solid curve <lb/>shows the signal, the long-dashed (brown) curve the combinatorial background, the <lb/>dashed (green) curve the B + → J /ψ K + (π + ) background, the dotted (blue) curve <lb/>the B 0 → J /ψ K * 0 background, the dash-dot curve (purple) the B 0 → J /ψπ + π − <lb/>background, the barely visible dotted curve (black) the sum of B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψη and <lb/>J /ψφ backgrounds, and the thick-solid (black) curve the total. (b) The same as <lb/>above but for like-sign di-pion combinations. (For interpretation of the references to <lb/>color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this Letter.) <lb/>We perform a simultaneous unbinned likelihood fit to the <lb/>π + π − opposite-sign and sum of π + π + and π − π − like-sign event <lb/>distributions. The fit gives a B 0 <lb/>s mass of 5366.1 ± 1.1 MeV in good <lb/>agreement with the known mass of 5366.3 ± 0.6 MeV, a Gaus-<lb/>sian width of 8.2 ± 1.1 MeV, consistent with the expected mass <lb/>resolution and 111 ± 14 signal events within ±30 MeV of the B 0 <lb/>s <lb/>mass. The change in twice the natural logarithm of the fit like-<lb/>lihood when removing the B 0 <lb/>s signal component, shows that the <lb/>signal has an equivalent of 12.8 standard deviations of significance. <lb/>The like-sign di-pion yield correctly describes the shape and level <lb/>of the background below the B 0 <lb/>s signal peak, both in data and <lb/>Monte Carlo simulations. There are also 23 ± 9 B 0 → J /ψπ + π − <lb/>events. <lb/>Having established a clear signal, we perform certain checks to <lb/>ascertain if the structure peaking near 980 MeV is a spin-0 ob-<lb/>ject. Since the B 0 <lb/>s is spinless, when it decays into a spin-1 J /ψ <lb/>and a spin-0 f 0 , the decay angle of the J /ψ should be distributed <lb/>as 1 − cos 2 θ J /ψ , where θ J /ψ is the angle of the μ + in the J /ψ <lb/>rest frame with respect to the B 0 <lb/>s direction. The polarization an-<lb/>gle, θ f 0 , the angle of the π + in the f 0 rest frame with respect <lb/>to the B 0 <lb/>s direction, should be uniformly distributed. A simula-<lb/>tion of the J /ψ detection efficiency in these decays shows that <lb/>it is approximately independent of cos θ J /ψ . The acceptance for <lb/>f 0 → π + π − as a function of the π + decay angle shows an in-<lb/>efficiency of about 50% at cos θ f 0 = ±1 with respect to its value at <lb/>cos θ f 0 = 0. It is fit to a parabola and the inefficiency corrected in <lb/>what follows. <lb/>The like-sign background subtracted J /ψ helicity distribution <lb/>is fit to a 1 − α cos 2 θ J /ψ function as shown in Fig. 5(a). The fit <lb/>gives α = 0.81 ± 0.21 consistent with a longitudinally polarized <lb/>J /ψ (spin perpendicular to its momentum) and a spin-0 f 0 me-<lb/>son. The χ 2 of the fit is 10.3 for 8 degrees of freedom. Similarly, <lb/>we subtract the like-sign background and fit the efficiency cor-<lb/>rected π + π − helicity distribution to a constant function as shown <lb/>in Fig. 5(b). The fit has a χ 2 /ndof equal to 15.9/9, still consistent <lb/>with a uniform distribution as expected for a spinless particle. <lb/>To view the spectrum of π + π − masses, between 580 and <lb/>1480 MeV, in the J /ψπ + π − final state we select events within <lb/>±30 MeV of the B 0 <lb/>s and plot the invariant mass spectrum in Fig. 6. <lb/>The data show a strong peak near 980 MeV and an excess of <lb/>events above the like-sign background extending up to 1500 MeV. <lb/>Our mass spectrum is similar in shape to those seen previously <lb/>in studies of the S-wave π + π − system with ss quarks in the ini-<lb/>tial state [13-15]. To establish a value for R f 0 /φ requires fitting the <lb/>shape of the f 0 resonance. Simulation shows that our acceptance <lb/>is independent of the π + π − mass, and we choose an interval <lb/>between 580 and 1480 MeV. Guidance is given by the BES Collab-<lb/>oration who fit the spectrum in J /ψ → φπ + π − decays [14]. We <lb/>include here the f 0 (980) and f 0 (1370) resonances, though other <lb/>final states may be present, for example the f 2 (1270) a 2 ++ state <lb/>[13,14]; it will take much larger statistics to sort out the higher <lb/>mass states. We use a coupled-channel Breit-Wigner amplitude <lb/>(Flatté) for the f 0 (980) resonance [16] and a Breit-Wigner shape <lb/>(BW) for the higher mass f 0 (1370). Defining m as the π + π − in-<lb/>variant mass, the mass distribution is fit with a function involving <lb/>the square of the interfering amplitudes <lb/>A(m) <lb/>2 = N 0 mp(m)q(m) Flatté f 0 (980) <lb/>+ A 1 exp (iδ) BW f 0 (1370) <lb/>2 , <lb/>(2) <lb/>where N 0 is a normalization constant, p(m) is the momentum <lb/>of the π + , q(m) the momentum of the J /ψ in the π + π − rest-<lb/>frame, and δ is the relative phase between the two components. <lb/>The Flatté amplitude is defined as <lb/>Flatté(m) = <lb/>1 <lb/>m 2 <lb/>0 − m 2 − im 0 (g 1 ρ ππ + g 2 ρ K K ) <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where m 0 refers to the mass of the f 0 (980) and ρ ππ and ρ K K are <lb/>Lorentz invariant phase space factors equal to 2p(m)/m for ρ ππ . <lb/>The g 2 ρ K K term accounts for the opening of the kaon threshold. <lb/>Here ρ K K = 2p K (m)/m where p K (m) is the momentum a kaon <lb/>would have in the π + π − rest-frame. It is taken as an imaginary <lb/>number when m is less than twice the kaon mass. We use m 0 g 1 = <lb/>0.165 ± 0.018 GeV 2 , and g 2 /g 1 = 4.21 ± 0.33 as determined by <lb/>BES [14]. <lb/>The f 0 (1370) mass and width values used here are 1434 ± <lb/>20 MeV, and 172 ± 33 MeV from an analysis by E791 [15]. We <lb/>fix the central values of these masses and widths in the fit, as well <lb/>as m 0 g 1 and the g 2 /g 1 ratio for the f 0 (980) amplitude. The mass <lb/>resolution is incorporated as a Gaussian convolution in the fit as a <lb/>function of π + π − mass. It has an r.m.s. of 5.4 MeV at 980 MeV. <lb/>We fit both the opposite-sign and like-sign distributions simulta-<lb/>neously. The results of the fit are shown in Fig. 6. The χ 2 /ndof is <lb/>44/56. We find an f 0 (980) mass value of 972 ± 25 MeV. There are <lb/>265 ± 26 events above background in the extended mass region, <lb/>of which (64 +10 <lb/>−6 )% are associated with the f 0 (980), (12 ± 4)% are <lb/>ascribed to the f 0 (1370) and (24 +2 <lb/>−6 )% are from interference. The <lb/>fit determines δ = 61 ± 36 • . The fit fraction is defined as the in-<lb/>tegral of a single component divided by the coherent sum of all <lb/>components. The f 0 (980) yield is 169 +31 <lb/>−21 events. The lower mass <lb/>cutoff of the fit region loses 1% of the f 0 (980) events. The change <lb/>in twice the log likelihood of the fit when removing the f 0 (980) <lb/>component shows that it has an equivalent of 12.5 standard devi-<lb/>ations of significance. <lb/>Using the 169 f 0 events from J /ψπ + π − , and the 635 φ events <lb/>from J /ψ K + K − , correcting by the relative efficiency, and ignor-<lb/></body>

The dashed curve is the like-sign background <lb/>that is taken from the data both in shape and absolute normalization. The dotted <lb/>curve is the result of the fit using Eq. (2) and the solid curve the total. <lb/>ing a possible small S-wave contribution under the φ peak [17], <lb/>yields <lb/>R f 0 /φ ≡ <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψ f 0 , f 0 → π + π − ) <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ, φ → K + K − ) <lb/>= 0.252 +0.046+0.027 <lb/>−0.032−0.033 . <lb/>(4) <lb/>Here and throughout this Letter whenever two uncertainties <lb/>are quoted the first is statistical and the second is system-<lb/>atic. This value of R f /φ depends on the decay amplitudes used <lb/>to fit the π + π − mass distribution and could change with dif-<lb/>ferent assumptions. To check the robustness of this result, an <lb/>incoherent phase space background is added to the above fit <lb/>function. The number of signal f 0 (980) events is decreased <lb/>by 7.3%. If we leave the f 0 (1370) out of this fit, the origi-<lb/>nal f 0 (980) yield is decreased by 6.5%. The larger number of <lb/>these two numbers is included in the systematic uncertainty. <lb/>The BES Collaboration also included a σ resonance in their fit <lb/>to the π + π − mass spectrum in J /ψ → φπ + π − decays [14]. <lb/>We do not find it necessary to add this component to the <lb/>fit. <lb/>The systematic uncertainty has several contributions listed in <lb/>Table 1. There is an uncertainty due to our kaon and pion iden-<lb/>tification. The identification efficiency is measured with respect <lb/>to the Monte Carlo simulation using samples of D * + → π + D 0 , <lb/>D 0 → K − π + events for kaons, and samples of K 0 <lb/>S → π + π − de-<lb/>cays for pions. The correction to R f 0 /φ is 0.947 ± 0.009. This cor-<lb/>rection is already included in the efficiencies quoted above, and <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Relative systematic uncertainties on R f0 /φ (%).

The <lb/>simulation underestimates the φ efficiency relative to the π + π − <lb/>efficiency by (6 ± 9)%, so we take 9% as the systematic error. <lb/>Besides the sources of uncertainty discussed above, there is a <lb/>variation due to varying the parameters of the two resonant con-<lb/>tributions. We also include an uncertainty for a mass dependent <lb/>efficiency as a function of π + π − mass by changing the acceptance <lb/>function from flat to linear and found that the f 0 yield changed <lb/>by 2.3%. The difference <lb/>/ between CP-even and CP-odd B s <lb/>eigenstates is taken as 0.088. <lb/>In order to give a model independent result we also quote the <lb/>fraction, R , in the interval ±90 MeV around 980 MeV, correspond-<lb/>ing to approximately two full-widths, where there are 111 ± 14 <lb/>events. Then <lb/>R ≡ <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψπ + π − , |m(π + π − ) − 980 MeV| &lt; 90 MeV) <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ, φ → K + K − ) <lb/>= 0.162 ± 0.022 ± 0.016. <lb/>(5) <lb/>This ratio is based on the fit to the B 0 <lb/>s mass distribution and does <lb/>not have any uncertainties related to the fit of the π + π − mass <lb/>distribution. Based on our fits to the π + π − mass distribution, <lb/>there are negligible contributions from any other signal compo-<lb/>nents than the f 0 (980) in this interval. <lb/>The original estimate from Stone and Zhang was R f 0 /φ = 0.20 <lb/>[6]. More recent predictions have been summarized by Stone [19] <lb/>and have a rather wide range from 0.07 to 0.50. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Conclusions <lb/>Based on the polarization and rate estimates described above, <lb/>the first observation of a new CP-odd eigenstate decay mode of the <lb/>B 0 <lb/>s meson into J /ψ f 0 (980) has been made. Using a fit including <lb/>two interfering resonances, the f 0 (980) and f 0 (1370), the ratio to <lb/>J /ψφ production is measured as <lb/>R f 0 /φ ≡ <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψ f 0 , f 0 → π + π − ) <lb/>(B 0 <lb/>s → J /ψφ, φ → K + K − ) <lb/>= 0.252 +0.046+0.027 <lb/>−0.032−0.033 . <lb/>(6) <lb/>By selecting events within ±90 MeV of the f 0 (980) mass the ratio <lb/>becomes R = 0.162 ± 0.022 ± 0.016. <lb/>The events around the f 0 (980) mass are large enough in rate <lb/>and have small enough backgrounds that they could be used to <lb/>measure β s without angular analysis. It may also be possible to <lb/>use other data in the π + π − mass region above the f 0 (980) for <lb/>this purpose if they turn out to be dominated by S-wave. <lb/></body>

Their best fit value is 2% [3]. <lb/>[18] We measure the K + K − π + yield from D + decays. Then the φ yield is extracted <lb/>and compared with the 0.28 ±0.05 measured fraction of K + K − within 20 MeV <lb/>of the φ mass from the CLEO-c Dalitz analysis. See P. Rubin, et al., CLEO Collab-<lb/>oration, Phys. Rev. D 78 (2008) 072003. Finally we use the measured branching <lb/>fraction ratio of K + K − π + /K + π − π + in D + decays of (10.58 ± 0.29)% [11] to <lb/>compare with Monte Carlo simulation. <lb/>[19] S.
