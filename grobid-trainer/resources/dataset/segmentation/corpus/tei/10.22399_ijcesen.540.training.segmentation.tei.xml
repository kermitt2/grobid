Their <lb/>damage often results in the collapse of the transport system and particularly affects <lb/>traffic safety. To avoid such a thing, it is necessary to carry out certain checks before <lb/>putting the bridges into traffic, which will provide information in advance about <lb/>whether there is a possibility of future damage. One of them is the so-called test load for <lb/>new bridge before it is taken into service. Therefore, bridge testing is the last external <lb/>monitoring action to be performed when a new bridge is built. The objective of these <lb/>tests is to verify that the mechanical behavior of the loaded structure conforms to its <lb/>design model. The system evaluated as part of this study was the Bridge Diagnostics, <lb/>Inc. (BDI) Wireless Structural Testing System (STS-Wi-Fi). All results are compared <lb/>with theoretic values based on the FE-model of the bridge and are calculated using <lb/>software SOFISTIK AG. Both the experimental results as well as the and analytical <lb/>results are presented in this paper and compared. The comparison of the analytical <lb/>results showed good agreement with the experimental results. <lb/></front>

        <body>1. Introduction <lb/>In order to provide an assessment regarding the use <lb/>of new bridges, it is necessary to compare the <lb/>results of the actual behavior of the bridge structure <lb/>with test loads corresponding to the respective <lb/>static design calculation. In general, it will be <lb/>verified that the finished construction of the <lb/>structure is technically correct, the behavior of the <lb/>structure under test load is in accordance with the <lb/>static calculation of the project, and that there are <lb/>no functional deficiencies during use. On the other <lb/>hand, the main objectives of the load testing is to <lb/>better understand the response of the bridge to <lb/>static and dynamic loads and conclude if the bridge <lb/>can be used in the future. <lb/>Within the framework of the standard for bridge <lb/>testing, HRN U.M1.046, the following are defined: <lb/>types of loads for testing, testing procedures and <lb/>evaluation of test results.[1] Verifications are made <lb/>for the relevant situations for reinforced concrete <lb/>bridges, pre-stressed concrete bridges, steel bridges <lb/>and composite structures.[2], [3] According to the <lb/>procedures defined by this standard, the response of <lb/>the bridge structure under the action of static and <lb/>dynamic loads is determined. It is estimated, <lb/>however, that the construction work has fulfilled <lb/>quality control/assurance requirement according to <lb/>the standard and project specifications for <lb/>the design life of service. <lb/>Environmental factors such as temperature, <lb/>humidity, and wind can affect structural response <lb/>and should be properly accounted for during the <lb/>load test preparation, the testing, and also the post-<lb/>test analysis [4].Temperature changes can affect the <lb/>results of a load test by: <lb/>a) causing an unexpected response of the sensor or <lb/>measuring technique, and <lb/>b) inducing thermal stresses and strains to the <lb/>structure. <lb/>The next sections compile information from load <lb/>tests on concrete bridges reported in the <lb/></body>

        <body>literature, and the measuring techniques or sensors <lb/>used during these tests[4][5]. <lb/>During the testing of the bridge in our case, the <lb/>atmospheric conditions were suitable for the testing <lb/>equipment, so they were within the criteria <lb/>required by these equipment&apos;s. <lb/>The approach of increasing refinement of the <lb/>assessment is in line with the Levels of <lb/>Approximation, first introduced in the fib Model <lb/>Code 2010 (fib, Citation2012). Figure 1 illustrates <lb/>the concept of the Levels of Approximation. For <lb/>assessment, this approach is called Levels of <lb/>Assessment [6] Many of the techniques mentioned, <lb/>such as the use of nondestructive testing, structural <lb/>monitoring [7], and assessment using nonlinear <lb/>finite element analysis currently do not form part of <lb/>the structural or bridge engineering curriculum, but <lb/>these techniques are becoming increasingly <lb/>important tools for bridge engineers. <lb/>A load testing has been carried out on the fully <lb/>completed bridge in Arllat, Km 7+817.86, Road <lb/>M9. Before conducting the test, the project <lb/>documentation was reviewed and the elements of <lb/>the structure were checked. <lb/>The purpose of this research is based on the <lb/>comparison of the results of the deflections, the <lb/>results of the strains, the angle of rotation in the <lb/>supports as well as the determination of the <lb/>dynamic response through the acceleration and <lb/>frequency from the mathematical model determined <lb/>by the software with the results obtained from the <lb/>test load carried out through the loaded with <lb/>assigned loads. <lb/>The program and testing were performed under the <lb/>leadership of the IPE-PROING team using the <lb/>System Test Framework -Wireless (STS-Wi-Fi) <lb/>from Bridge Diagnostics, Inc. (BDI).[8] <lb/>2. Materials and methods <lb/>2.1 Loading tests on bridges <lb/>Testing of the finished bridge under a specific <lb/>load is necessary after the work is completed. <lb/>This procedure, based on which it will be <lb/>established whether there are conditions to <lb/>conclude that the constructed bridge is <lb/>technically correct, that the behavior of the <lb/>structure under load is in accordance with the <lb/>static calculation provided by the project, and <lb/>that there are no functional defects during <lb/>loading.[9] Both static and dynamic test loads <lb/>are mandatory for road bridges with a span of <lb/>15 meters or more, railway bridges with a span <lb/>of 10 meters or more, and bridges with <lb/>exceptional test loads regardless of the <lb/>span.[10] <lb/>During static load testing it is mandatory to <lb/>measure the vertical displacement between each <lb/>span of the bridge, measure the displacements of <lb/>the supports, evaluate the appearance of cracks, <lb/>measure the deformations at the positions of the <lb/>maximum expected impacts, measure the <lb/>permanent deformations and deformations after <lb/>unloading. <lb/>If additional measurements are required by the test <lb/>program, then the following must be evaluated: <lb/>rotation <lb/>angle, <lb/>horizontal <lb/>displacements, <lb/>displacements of supports and foundations. <lb/>During dynamic load testing, it is mandatory to <lb/>measure the velocity of the moving load passing on <lb/>the bridge as well as the vertical displacement <lb/>between <lb/>certain <lb/>locations <lb/>during <lb/>the <lb/>3 passage of the vehicle. [11][12] If additional <lb/>measurements are required by the test program, <lb/>then these additional measurements must also be <lb/>evaluated: measurement of transverse and <lb/>longitudinal displacements between the selected <lb/>locations and measurement of the dynamic <lb/>characteristics of the structure (vibration <lb/>frequencies, mode shapes and damping value). [10] <lb/>In order to be able to start applying the test load, it <lb/>is necessary to do the following: review the project <lb/>documentation, compile a test program that <lb/>includes the size and distribution of the load by <lb/>stages, the calculation of the expected deformations <lb/>and deflections, the layout of the measuring points <lb/>and the test scheme. Furthermore, it is necessary to <lb/>look at the documentation on the quality of the <lb/>materials and finally to carry out a macroscopic <lb/>inspection of the bridge. <lb/>The bridge will be considered a correct construction <lb/>if: <lb/>-Measured deflections and displacements <lb/>are less than or equal to the theoretical <lb/>ones. <lb/>-Measured permanent deflections after <lb/>unloading less than 15% max. of measured <lb/>deflections at the same place for steel and <lb/>coupled bridges, 20% of measured <lb/></body>

For the structure of <lb/>the bridge, grade C 30/37 concrete was used in the <lb/>foundations, C 35/45 in the piers and C 40/50 in the <lb/>beam-slab. [13], [14], [15]. <lb/>For the materials used, relevant certificates have <lb/>been provided from which it can be concluded that <lb/>the elements of the structure are made of materials <lb/>with physical-mechanical characteristics that meet <lb/>project requirements. <lb/>Figure 1. Longitudinal and cross sections of the bridge <lb/>The Structural Testing System -Wireless (STS-Wi-<lb/>Fi) from Bridge Diagnostics, Inc.[16] (BDI) was <lb/>used to perform load testing of the bridge. The BDI <lb/>test equipment system consists of the STS-Wi-Fi <lb/>Base Station, STS-Wi-Fi Node and corresponding <lb/>sensors. Each component of the system is involved <lb/>in the data collection process. (Figure 2) <lb/>When BDI system is used, it is organized into an <lb/>infrastructure. This means that the Mobile Base <lb/>Station is used to run the system. The Mobile Base <lb/>Station serves two purposes: first, it extends the <lb/>range of the system using antennas, and second, it <lb/>increases the efficiency of the system by acting as a <lb/>relay between the PC and the STS-Wi-Fi nodal <lb/>point. The diagram below shows the infrastructure&apos;s <lb/>shape (Figure 2) <lb/>Figure 2. The wireless Structural Testing System (STS-<lb/>WiFi) by Bridge Diagnostics, Inc. The BDI test <lb/>equipment system. <lb/>As seen in this figure, everything is controlled on <lb/>the PC.

Consequently, by installing sensors <lb/>in the primary elements of the structure and using <lb/>the data 5 recorded from each node, a clear picture <lb/>of how the applied actions distribute those effects is <lb/>presented. <lb/>The BDI Software Packet is the analytical modeling <lb/>part of the testing system and consists of three main <lb/>components: WinGRF -data presentation, <lb/>WinGEN -model generator, and WinSAC -<lb/>structural analysis and correlation. All elements <lb/>serve different purposes, but each is essential to the <lb/>overall process. Each component has been <lb/>developed to move data from one application to <lb/>another seamlessly. WinGRF is used for graphical <lb/>data presentation and is the first step in modeling, <lb/>while WinGEN is a finite element model <lb/>generator.[8], [17], [15] <lb/>Instrumentation of the bridge in this case study <lb/>consisted of: 10-LVDT (Linear Variable <lb/>Differential Transducer), 10-Accelerometers, 4 <lb/>Tiltmeters and located as shown in (Figure 3).[18] <lb/>Figure 3. Instrument positioning in the Bridge and basse <lb/>station <lb/>2.1.2 Testing Loads <lb/>Static loading is usually conducted with trucks <lb/>filled with sand or gravel that have been weighed, <lb/>and the load is distributed along the axles (Figure <lb/>4).[10][19] The bridge was loaded in accordance <lb/>with the phases and the load scheme that were <lb/>drawn up before the start of the measurement. [20] <lb/>For static load, 4 trucks were used with the <lb/>following loads: <lb/>Tr. 1 = 40520 kg, Tr. 2 = 39380 kg, Tr. 3 = 39380 <lb/>kg and Tr. 4=39660 kg. <lb/>Figure 4. Loaded trucks, axle dimensions and loads <lb/>For static load, 4 trucks were used, which were <lb/>directed <lb/>and <lb/>positioned <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>most <lb/>unfavorable positions on the bridge (Figure 5,and <lb/>Figure 6). During the loading-unloading 6 <lb/>process of the bridge, the following measurements <lb/>were taken: delflection, acceleration and rotation <lb/>angle at the characteristic points of the bridge.[21], <lb/>[22], [23], 24] <lb/></body>

        <body>Dynamic loads were selected from the ranks of <lb/>static loads used. For dynamic load, 2 trucks = ~ <lb/>800kN were used (the number of vehicles is equal <lb/>to the number of lanes). These vehicles moved <lb/>uniformly from the beginning to the end of the <lb/>bridge, with velocity of ~5 and 20 km/h. In the case <lb/>of the action of moving loads, the deflection, <lb/>rotation angle vibration acceleration and dynamic <lb/>characteristics of the bridge were measured at the <lb/>characteristic points of the bridge.[11] <lb/>Figure 5.

Results and discussion <lb/>In principle, during load testing, subject of <lb/>measurement in the relevant elements of the bridge <lb/>are displacements, deformations, rotation angle, <lb/>oscillation phenomena, etc. <lb/>After the measurement, the data is processed and <lb/>displayed as presented: Figures 8-13 present the <lb/>results of deflections from the action of the static <lb/>load as well as from the action of the dynamic load <lb/>during the movement of trucks at a speed of 20 <lb/>km/h for spans I, II and III, while in figures 9, 11, <lb/>13, they are presented the results of the magnitudes, <lb/>the angle of rotation in the first span, while the <lb/>results of the accelerations in spanss II and III from <lb/>the action of the dynamic load (load movement <lb/>speed 20km/h). Figure 14 shows the results of the <lb/>deflections in the first area calculated in the <lb/>mathematical model with the Sofistic software. In <lb/>the end, the obtained results are compared with the <lb/>calculations by measurement phases. As a final step <lb/>in the load testing of bridges , is the compilation of <lb/>a report issued by the entity that conducts the test. <lb/>Modeling and analysis of the structure was <lb/>performed using &quot;SOFISTIK&quot; software.[25] The <lb/>load is modeled same as in the test phase and traffic <lb/>loads. Based on the results obtained from the <lb/>experimental measurements and the theoretical <lb/>values from the analysis, the maximum <lb/>displacement values from the respective analysis <lb/>are presented below. The maximum values of span <lb/>displacements in the static system of the bridge as a <lb/>function of static loads for 4-vehicles and from <lb/>dynamic loads for 2-parallel vehicles are given in <lb/>table 1. <lb/>Figure 8.

        <body>well. This shows that the dynamic behavior of <lb/>the bridge is satisfactory and that the numerical <lb/>model used in the analysis of the existing <lb/>structure is realistic. <lb/>-It is also estimated that the bridge was built in <lb/>accordance with the quality of the works <lb/>according to the requirements of the project and <lb/>the design lifetime of service. <lb/>-It is generally verified that the finished <lb/>construction of the structure is technically <lb/>correct, the behavior of the structure under test <lb/>load is in accordance with the static calculation <lb/>of the project and that there are no functional <lb/>deficiencies during use. <lb/>3.

In the same way, documentation of <lb/>the quality of the materials should be checked, as <lb/>well as a complete overview of the bridge. <lb/>The nature and geometry of the bridge, and in <lb/>particular, the characteristics of the superstructure <lb/>and the nature of the supports, influence on the <lb/>choice and positioning of the measuring equipment. <lb/>Through comparison of frequency values from <lb/>experimental measurements with dynamic loads <lb/>and those calculated from free oscillations of the <lb/>structure, it is shown that the dynamic behavior of <lb/>the bridge is satisfactory and the numerical model <lb/>used in the analysis of the existing structure is real. <lb/>In general, load testing of road bridges will prove <lb/>that the finished construction of the structure is <lb/>technically correct, the behavior of the structure <lb/>under test load is in accordance with the static <lb/>calculation of the project and that there are no <lb/>functional deficiencies during service. <lb/></body>
