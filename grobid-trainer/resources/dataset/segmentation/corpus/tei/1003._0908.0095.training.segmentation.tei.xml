			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>The old standard cosmological model of a universe full <lb/>of baryon matter only and regulated by the laws of Ein-<lb/>stein General Relativity provided a remarkable picture to <lb/>consistently explain the background evolution of the uni-<lb/>verse from the initial singularity up to the present day. <lb/>Unfortunately, two observational facts then putted in se-<lb/>rious trouble this elegant scenario. On the one hand, <lb/>it turned out that the gravitational field measured on <lb/>different scales may not be reconciled with what is in-<lb/>ferred from baryonic matter only, the most famous ex-<lb/>ample being represented by the flat rotation curves of <lb/>spiral galaxies [1]. On the other hand, recent data on the <lb/>Hubble diagram of Type Ia Supernovae (hereafter SNeIa) <lb/>provided the first evidence for an accelerated expansion <lb/>[2]. Surprising as it was, the cosmic speed up has been <lb/>then confirmed by updated SNeIa data [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], <lb/>the anisotropy spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Back-<lb/>ground Radiation (CMBR) as measured by both balloon <lb/>[8] and satellites [9, 10] experiments, and the data on the <lb/>large scale clustering of galaxies [11] as estimated from <lb/>large spectroscopic galaxy surveys. <lb/>Both these problems have been traditionally solved by <lb/>adding new ingredients to the cosmic pie, while leav-<lb/>ing unchanged the underlying theory. Cold dark matter <lb/>(CDM) has been then invoked to fill the gap between the <lb/>baryon mass (constrained by the Big Bang nucleosynthe-<lb/>sis) and what is needed to reproduce the observed gravi-<lb/>tational field. Moreover, this mysterious component must <lb/>not interact with anything but gravitationally so to have <lb/>escaped any detection notwithstanding the incredible ef-<lb/> </body>

			<body>forts spent up to now to find direct evidence for any dark <lb/>particle. At the cosmological scales, dark matter still be-<lb/>haves as normal matter so that a further component is <lb/>needed in order to drive the accelerated expansion. This <lb/>new actor on the scene must, moreover, have an unusual <lb/>negative pressure and not cluster on galactic and clus-<lb/>ter scales in order to not oppose gravitational clustering. <lb/>Referred to as dark energy, the nature and nurture of this <lb/>new term is still debated with the cosmological constant <lb/>Λ [12] being the simplest candidate. Although added by <lb/>hand ad hoc, the cosmological model comprising both <lb/>of them and known as ΛCDM is able to fit extremely <lb/>well the full dataset at disposal [13] thus worthing the <lb/>name of concordace model. Notwithstanding this remark-<lb/>able success, the ΛCDM is theoretically unappealing be-<lb/>cause of several well known shortcomings which moti-<lb/>vated the search for other dark energy candidates such <lb/>as quintessence scalar fields [14] and modified gravity the-<lb/>ories, either introducing higher dimensions [15] or corret-<lb/>ing the gravitational Lagrangian [16, 17]. <lb/>It is worth noting that both dark matter and dark <lb/>energy can be avoided if one accepts that the problem <lb/>is not with what is missing, but rather with how we <lb/>describe gravity. From this point of view, all the evi-<lb/>dences for dark matter and dark energy should be rather <lb/>seen as evidence that something is wrong with the New-<lb/>ton -Einstein theory of gravity. As a next step, one has <lb/>therefore to look for a way to modify gravity at both the <lb/>galactic and cosmological scales possibly finding a unified <lb/>mechanism explaining phenomena taking place on very <lb/>different scales such as the flatness of rotation curves and <lb/>the acceleration of the universe expansion. <lb/>Generalized Einstein -Aether theories are one of these <lb/>proposed mechanisms based on the introduction of dy-<lb/>namical timelike vector field with noncanonical kinetic <lb/>terms. Such a proposal is not fully new, but builds upon <lb/>the extensive analysis of standard Einstein -Aether theo-<lb/></body>

			<body>ries [18] as phenomenological probes of Lorenz violation <lb/>in quantum gravity. Indeed, the nonvanishing expec-<lb/>tation value of the Aether field will dynamically select <lb/>a preferred frame in the spacetime, namely the one in <lb/>which the time coordinate basis vector ∂ t is aligned with <lb/>the direction of the vector field, thus leading to viola-<lb/>tion of the Lorenz and gauge invariance. The interest in <lb/>these models was then renewed after the demonstration <lb/>[20] that TeVeS, i.e. the fully relativistic and complete <lb/>MOND theory [19], can be reformulated as a generalized <lb/>Einstein -Aether theory. Later, it has been shown that <lb/>it is possible to get a MOND -like behaviour in the weak <lb/>field regime of vector models [21]. Motivated by these <lb/>considerations, we explore here the cosmological viabil-<lb/>ity of these theories by suitably setting the vector field <lb/>Lagrangian in such a way that the successfull MOND <lb/>phenomenology is recovered in the Newtonian limit. <lb/>The structure of the paper is as follows. The basic <lb/>equations and properties of the vector models are de-<lb/>scribed in Sect. II where we also explain how we choose <lb/>the vector field Lagragian. Sect. III is devoted to a de-<lb/>tailed description of the statistical methodology and the <lb/>data used to test the models in the low redhift regime <lb/>with a discussion of the results obtained from the like-<lb/>lihood analysis. A similar test is then presented and <lb/>discussed in Sect. IV where we add high redhift data to <lb/>probe this complementary redshift range. Conclusions <lb/>and perspectives are finally given in Sect. V. <lb/>II. THE MODEL <lb/>A general action for a vector field A coupled to gravity <lb/>can be written as <lb/>S = d 4 x <lb/>√ −g <lb/>R <lb/>16πG N <lb/>+ L(g, A) + S M <lb/>(1) <lb/>where G N is the Newton gravitational constant, g the <lb/>metric (with the signature -, +, +, +), R the Ricci scalar <lb/>and S M the matter action. The vector field Lagrangian <lb/>L may be a whatever covariant and local function, but, <lb/>following [21], we will only consider the case : <lb/>L(g, A) = <lb/>M 2 <lb/>16πG N <lb/>F (K) + <lb/>λ(A α A α + 1) <lb/>16πG N <lb/>(2) <lb/>where F is a generic function of <lb/>K = M −2 K αβ <lb/>γσ ∇ α A γ ∇ β A σ <lb/>(3) <lb/>K αβ <lb/>γσ = c 1 g αβ g γσ + c 2 δ α <lb/>γ δ β <lb/>σ + c 3 δ α <lb/>σ δ β <lb/>γ . <lb/>(4) <lb/>It is worth noticing that K represents all the possible <lb/>canonical kinetic terms that we introduce in the vector <lb/>Lagrangian through the generic function F (K) thus al-<lb/>lowing to have also a noncanonical contribution by these <lb/>terms. The c i quantities are dimensionless constants, <lb/>while M is a scaling mass parameter and λ a nondynami-<lb/>cal Lagrange multiplier with dimensions of mass squared. <lb/>It is possible to show [21, 22, 23] that the Einstein field <lb/>equations may still be formally written as <lb/>G αβ = T αβ + 8πG N T M <lb/>αβ <lb/>(5) <lb/>with G αβ and T M <lb/>αβ the usual Einstein and matter stress -<lb/>energy tensors, while T αβ contains the terms related to <lb/>the vector field and some of its derivatives (see, e.g., [21] <lb/>for its full expression), while the equation of motion for <lb/>the vector field reads : <lb/>∇ α (F ′ J α <lb/>β ) + F ′ y β = 2λA γ <lb/>(6) <lb/>with F ′ = dF /dK and <lb/>J α <lb/>σ = K αβ <lb/>σγ + K βα <lb/>γσ ∇ β A γ <lb/>(7) <lb/>and defined the functional derivative : <lb/>y β = ∇ σ A η ∇ γ A ξ <lb/>δ K σγ <lb/>ηξ <lb/>δA β <lb/>. <lb/>(8) <lb/>Introducing the flat Robertson -Walker metric in Eq.(5) <lb/>then gives the modified Friedmann equations which read : <lb/>1 − αK 1/2 d <lb/>dK <lb/>F <lb/>K 1/2 <lb/>H 2 = <lb/>8πG N <lb/>3 <lb/>ρ , <lb/>(9) <lb/>d <lb/>dt <lb/>α <lb/>dF <lb/>dK <lb/>− 2 H = 8πG N (ρ + p) , <lb/>(10) <lb/>where, because of the metric symmetry, it is : <lb/>K = 3α <lb/>H 2 <lb/>M 2 = <lb/>3α <lb/>ε 2 <lb/>H 2 <lb/>H 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Here, we have defined two new parameters, namely ε = <lb/>M/H 0 and α = c 1 + 3c 2 + c 3 , while (ρ, p) are the total <lb/>energy density and pressure of the source terms (matter, <lb/>radiation, neutrinos, etc.) and H =ȧ/a is the usual <lb/>Hubble parameter. Hereafter, we will denote derivatives <lb/>with respect to t with a dot and to K with a prime, and <lb/>use a subscript ′′ 0 ′′ to label present day quantities. <lb/>It is convenient to rearrange the above equations in a <lb/>different form. To this end, we first solve Eq.(9) to get : <lb/>αF ′ (K) = 1 − <lb/>ρ(z) <lb/>ρ crit E 2 (z) <lb/>+ <lb/>αF (K) <lb/>2K <lb/>(12) <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>with E(z) = H(z)/H 0 the dimensionless Hubble param-<lb/>eter. Inserting Eq.(12) into Eq.(10) and using <lb/>d <lb/>dt <lb/>= −(1 + z)H 0 E(z) <lb/>d <lb/>dz <lb/>to change variable, one finally gets : <lb/>d <lb/>dz <lb/>ε 2 F (K) <lb/>6E 2 (z) <lb/>− <lb/>ρ/ρ crit <lb/>E 2 (z) <lb/>− 1 E 2 (z) = − <lb/>3(ρ + p)/ρ crit <lb/>(1 + z)E(z) <lb/>(13) <lb/>with ρ crit = 3H 2 <lb/>0 /8πG N the present day critical density. <lb/>Let us now assume that the universe is filled by a matter -<lb/>like term and radiation. Since the vector field is only <lb/>coupled to gravity, the continuity equatioṅ <lb/>ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0 <lb/>still holds for both matter and radiation and we can <lb/>therefore write the rhs of Eq.(13) as <lb/>3(ρ + p)/ρ crit <lb/>(1 + z)E(z) <lb/>= <lb/>[3Ω M + 4Ω r (1 + z)] (1 + z) 2 <lb/>E(z) <lb/>(14) <lb/>with Ω i = ρ i (z = 0)/ρ crit the present day density pa-<lb/>rameter of the i -th component. <lb/>Eqs.(12) -(13) clearly show that a key role in deter-<lb/>mining the cosmic evolution is played by the functional <lb/>expression adopted for F (K). A guide to the choice of <lb/>this quantity is provided by the observation that, in the <lb/>nonrelativistic regime, the field equations reduce to : <lb/>∇ • 2 + c 1 <lb/>dF <lb/>dK <lb/>∇Φ = 8πG N ρ <lb/>(15) <lb/>with <lb/>K = −c 1 <lb/>|∇Φ| 2 <lb/>M 2 , <lb/>(16) <lb/>being Φ the gravitational potential sourced by the density <lb/>distribution ρ. By using the above expression, we get : <lb/>∇ • [µ(|∇Φ|/M )∇Φ] = 8πG N ρ <lb/>(17) <lb/>which is the modified Poisson equation for the MOND <lb/>theory 1 , provided we identify the MOND interpolating <lb/>function µ(a/a 0 ) with <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">1 Actually, such a modified Poisson equation was proposed for <lb/>MOND in the framework of the so called AQUAL theory [26], <lb/>one of the first attempts to work out a relativistic MOND theory. <lb/>AQUAL was later abandoned since it turned out to be unable to <lb/>account for lensing data without cold dark matter thus being in <lb/>contrast with the original MOND philosophy. <lb/></note>

			<body>µ(a/a 0 ) = µ( <lb/>√ <lb/>K) = 2 + c 1 <lb/>dF <lb/>dK <lb/>. <lb/>(18) <lb/>Note that, by this position, the MOND acceleration scale <lb/>a 0 turns out to be related to the mass scale M as <lb/>a 0 = <lb/>εcH 0 <lb/>√ <lb/>−c 1 <lb/>⇐⇒ c 1 = − <lb/>εcH 0 <lb/>a 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>, <lb/>(19) <lb/>where we have reintroduced the speed of light c. It is <lb/>worth noting that such a model thus provides a natural <lb/>mechanism to explain why one observationally finds that <lb/>a 0 ∼ cH 0 which now emerges as a consequence of the <lb/>local and cosmological phenomena being different mani-<lb/>festations of the same underlying theory. <lb/>Since we know that MOND makes it possible to fit the <lb/>flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies (see, e.g., [24] and <lb/>refs. therein), it is reasonable to assume that a viable <lb/>expression for F (K) should lead to the same interpolat-<lb/>ing function µ(a/a 0 ) which is successfully used on local <lb/>scales. Two such functions are the simple form [25] <lb/>µ(x) = <lb/>x <lb/>1 + x <lb/>, <lb/>(20) <lb/>and the standard form [26] <lb/>µ(x) = <lb/>x <lb/>√ <lb/>1 + x 2 <lb/>. <lb/>(21) <lb/>Although Eq.(21) has been the first proposal to be tested <lb/>with success [24], recent analyses [25, 27] seem to favour <lb/>Eq.(20). However, in order to gain further insight on <lb/>the problem of which interpolating function is better <lb/>motivated, we will consider both cases contrasting them <lb/>against data probing radically different scales. <lb/>Inserting alternatively Eqs.(20) and (21) into Eq.(18) <lb/>gives respectively : <lb/>F (K) = − <lb/>4 <lb/>c 1 <lb/>√ <lb/>K − ln 1 + <lb/>√ <lb/>K <lb/>, <lb/>(22) <lb/>F (K) = − <lb/>2 <lb/>c 1 <lb/>K − K (1 + K) + ln <lb/>√ <lb/>K + <lb/>√ <lb/>1 + K <lb/>. <lb/>(23) <lb/>Hereafter, we will refer to the models assigned by <lb/>Eqs.(22) and (23) as the simple and standard MONDian <lb/>vector model in order to clearly remember that the main <lb/>ingredient of this kind of cosmological theory is the pres-<lb/>ence of a vector field with a Lagrangian constructed in <lb/>such a way to recover the simple or standard MOND in-<lb/>terpolating function. Both expressions for F (K) depend <lb/>on <lb/>√ <lb/>K so that it must be α &gt; 0 in the cosmological <lb/>setting. In the small K limit, F (K) ∼ K for both the <lb/>simple and standard MONDian vector models so that we <lb/></body>

			<body>can use the perturbative analysis in [28] for the Einstein -<lb/>Aether models to see whether the condition α &gt; 0 is com-<lb/>patible with the constraints on the coefficients c i . The <lb/>requirement that the Hamiltonian for the perturbations <lb/>is positive definite implies c 1 &lt; 0, while the constraint <lb/>(c 1 + c 2 + c 3 )/c 1 ≥ 0 has to be set in order to avoid tachy-<lb/>onic propagation of spin -0 modes. On the other hand, if <lb/>we allow superluminal propagations of both spin -0 and <lb/>spin -2 modes, as supported in [29], we then get that for <lb/>c 2 &gt; 0 and <lb/>−(c 1 + 3c 2 ) ≤ c 3 ≤ −(c 1 + c 2 ) <lb/>it is indeed α &gt; 0 so that we can safely consider <lb/>the MONDian vector models without violating any con-<lb/>straint on the c i coefficients. <lb/>A. The simple MONDian vector model <lb/>In order to determine the dynamics for this case, we <lb/>have to insert Eq.(22) into the master equation (13) and <lb/>solve with respect to E(z). Somewhat surprisingly, after <lb/>some algebra, we get : <lb/>Q[z, E(z)] × <lb/>dE <lb/>dz <lb/>= 0 <lb/>with Q[z, E(z)] an algebraic function of redshit z, the <lb/>dimensionless Hubble parameter E(z) and the constant <lb/>parameter of the model. Since we know that the uni-<lb/>verse is expanding, dE/dz &gt; 0 so that we must solve <lb/>Q[z, E(z)] = 0. Rearranging the different terms gives : <lb/>ηy 3 + y 2 − η {κ[1 − ln (1 + ηy)] + [Ω M + Ω r (1 + z)] <lb/>×(1 + z) 3 y + κ ln (1 + ηy) = [Ω M + Ω r (1 + z)](1 + z) 3 } , <lb/>(24) <lb/>where we have set y = E(z) and defined : <lb/>η = <lb/>√ <lb/>3α <lb/>ε <lb/>, <lb/>(25) <lb/>κ = <lb/>2ε 2 <lb/>3c 1 <lb/>= − <lb/>2a 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>3c 2 H 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>≃ −0.01 h −2 . <lb/>(26) <lb/>with h = H 0 /(100/km/s/Mpc). Note that, in the rhs <lb/>of Eq.(26), we have used Eq.(19) and set a 0 = 1.2 × <lb/>10 −10 m/s 2 in agreement with the estimates coming from <lb/>the MOND fit to the galaxy rotation curves. <lb/>In order to reduce the number of parameters of the <lb/>model, we can insert Eq.(22) into (12) and evaluate it at <lb/>z = 0. Remembering that E(z = 0) = 1 by definition, <lb/>we then get : <lb/>ln (1 + η) − <lb/>η <lb/>1 + η <lb/>= <lb/>1 − Ω M − Ω r <lb/>κ <lb/>(27) <lb/>which can be solved numerically for given values of <lb/>(Ω M , Ω r , h). Actually, since Ω r is typically set by the <lb/>CMB temperature, the simple MONDian vector model <lb/>is fully characterized by only two parameters. This is <lb/>the same as the concordance ΛCDM model where the <lb/>same parameters (Ω M , h) have to be assigned in order <lb/>to compare the theory with the data. However, in that <lb/>scenario, two different ingredients are invoked in order to <lb/>explain the dynamics of galaxies and the cosmic speed <lb/>up, while here the solution to both problems comes out <lb/>as a consequence of the presence of a single vector field. <lb/>B. The standard MONDian vector model <lb/>We can repeat the same steps as before to get the mas-<lb/>ter equation for the case when F (K) is given by Eq.(23). <lb/>Not surprisingly given the similarities of the models, we <lb/>still get an algebraic relation : <lb/>2 + κη 2 + <lb/>κη <lb/>y 1 + η 2 y 2 <lb/>− <lb/>κη 3 y <lb/>1 + η 2 y 2 <lb/>= <lb/>2 [Ω M + Ω r (1 + z)] (1 + z) 3 + κ ln ηy + 1 + η 2 y 2 <lb/>y 2 <lb/>(28) <lb/>with y, η and κ defined as above. The relation between <lb/>η and the other model parameters may be obtained as <lb/>before and turns out to be : <lb/>ln η + 1 + η 2 − <lb/>η(1 − η 2 ) <lb/>1 + η 2 <lb/>= <lb/>2(1 − Ω M − Ω r ) <lb/>κ <lb/>(29) <lb/>which has still to be solved numerically. Note that, as <lb/>for the simple case, also the standard MONDian vector <lb/>model is characterized by only two quantities, namely the <lb/>total matter density parameter Ω M and the present day <lb/>scaled Hubble constant h. <lb/>III. TESTING THE LOW REDSHIFT REGIME <lb/>Any model that aims to describe the evolution of the <lb/>universe must be able to reproduce what is indeed ob-<lb/>served. This is particularly true for the models we are <lb/>considering since we are introducing a single vector field <lb/>to get rid of both dark matter and dark energy. Match-<lb/>ing the model with observations is also a powerful tool to <lb/>constrain its parameters and, as an interesting byprod-<lb/>uct, allows us to estimate some quantities common to <lb/>every model (such as the age of the universe t 0 and the <lb/>transition redshift z T ) to previous literature values. <lb/>As a first test, we are here interested in exploring the <lb/>behaviour of our models in the low redshift regime so <lb/>that we start by only considering data probing up to <lb/>z ∼ 1.5. To this end, we therefore maximize the following <lb/>likelihood function : <lb/></body>

Before <lb/>discussing in detail the term related to the SNeIa data, <lb/>we concentrate on the two Gaussian priors. The first one <lb/>takes into account the constraints on the the physical <lb/>baryon density ω b = Ω b h 2 with <lb/>ω obs <lb/>b <lb/>± δω b = 0.0228 ± 0.0055 <lb/>as estimated in [30] and in agreement with what is in-<lb/>ferred from the abundance of ligth elements [31]. The <lb/>HST Key Project [32] has estimated the Hubble constant <lb/>H 0 using a well calibrated set of local distance scale es-<lb/>timators thus ending up with <lb/>h HST ± δh = 0.720 ± 0.008 <lb/>as a final model independent constraint. <lb/>A. The SNeIa data <lb/>Since the first announcement [2] of the evidence of cos-<lb/>mic speed up, the importance of the SNeIa Hubble dia-<lb/>gram as a probe of the universe background evolution <lb/>has always been clear. It has therefore become a sort of <lb/>ground zero for every proposed cosmological model to fit <lb/>the SNeIa data. To this end, one relies on the predicted <lb/>distance modulus 2 : <lb/>µ th (z, p) = 25 + 5 log <lb/>c <lb/>H 0 <lb/>(1 + z)r(z, p) <lb/>(31) <lb/>with r(z) the dimensionless comoving distance : <lb/>r(z, p) = <lb/>z <lb/>0 <lb/>dz ′ <lb/>E(z ′ , p) <lb/>. <lb/>(32) <lb/>The likelihood function is then defined as <lb/>L SN eIa (p) = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π) NSNeIa/2 |C −1 <lb/>SN eIa | 1/2 <lb/>× exp − <lb/>∆µ • C −1 <lb/>SN eIa • ∆µ T <lb/>2 <lb/>, (33) <lb/></body>

			<body>where N SN eIa is the total number of SNeIa used, ∆µ is a <lb/>N SN eIa -dimensional vector with the values of µ obs (z i ) − <lb/>µ th (z i ) and C SN eIa is the N SN eIa × N SN eIa covariance <lb/>matrix of the SNeIa data. Note that, if we neglect the <lb/>correlation induced by systematic errors, C SN eIa is a di-<lb/>agonal matrix so that Eq.(33) simplifies to : <lb/>L SN eIa (p) ∝ exp [−χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa (p)/2] <lb/>(34) <lb/>with <lb/>χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa (p) = <lb/>NSNeIa <lb/>i=1 <lb/>µ obs (z i ) − µ th (z i ) <lb/>σ i <lb/>2 <lb/>(35) <lb/>with σ i the error on the observed distance modulus <lb/>µ obs (z i ) for the i -th object at redshift z i . As input data, <lb/>we use the Union SNeIa sample assembled in [33] by re-<lb/>analysing with the same pipeline both the recent SNeIa <lb/>SNLS [5] and ESSENCE [6] samples and older nearby <lb/>and high redshift [4] datasets. <lb/>B. How many model parameters ? <lb/>As shown by Eqs.(24) and (28), in order to deter-<lb/>mine the cosmic dynamics, one has to set the value of <lb/>the present day total matter density parameter Ω M . On <lb/>the other hand, the Gaussian prior on ω b in the likeli-<lb/>hood function (30) and of the distance priors introduced <lb/>later asks for discriminating between the baryons only <lb/>and total matter physical densities. It is therefore worth <lb/>wondering how Ω M and Ω b are related. Since our the-<lb/>ory reduces to MOND in the low energy limit and MOND <lb/>does not need any cold dark matter on the galactic scales <lb/>(hence no other matter than the visible one), we could ar-<lb/>gue that Ω M = Ω b should hold. On the other hand, large <lb/>amounts of missing matter are needed in order MOND to <lb/>reproduce the observed phenomenology on cluster scales <lb/>[34]. It was therefore postulated [35] that massive neu-<lb/>trinos (with m ν ∼ 2 eV) can play the role of dark mass <lb/>in galaxy clusters. Moreover, solar and atmospheric neu-<lb/>trinos experiments [36] have shown that the three active <lb/>neutrinos from the standard model of particle physics <lb/>mix their flavours which is only possible if they are mas-<lb/>sive. Finally, it is also worth noting that it has been <lb/>claimed [37] that a single sterile neutrino with mass in <lb/>the range 4 -6 eV is better suited to explain the results <lb/>of the Miniboone experiment, while a 11 eV sterile neu-<lb/>trino has been indeed advocated [38] in order to solve the <lb/>MOND problems on cluster and cosmological scales. <lb/>Massive neutrinos decoupled at ∼ 1 MeV and since <lb/>last scattering they have been non relativistic particles <lb/>so that, from a cosmological point of view, they behave <lb/>exactly as matter. Assuming three families of degenerate <lb/>neutrinos, the total matter density parameter will there-<lb/>fore read : <lb/></body>

The upper <lb/>and lower part of the table refers to the simple and standard <lb/>MONDian vector model respectively. <lb/>Ω M = Ω b + <lb/>3m ν <lb/>94h 2 eV <lb/>(36) <lb/>so that the number of model parameters is increased by <lb/>one updating from (Ω M , h) to (Ω b , m ν , h). <lb/>It is worth stressing, however, that discriminating be-<lb/>tween Ω M as a single quantity and Ω M as function of <lb/>(Ω b , m ν , h) is only possible if the data at hand depend <lb/>on them separetely. To understand this point, let us <lb/>consider the SNeIa Hubble diagram. In order to fit this <lb/>dataset, we just need the dimensionless Hubble parame-<lb/>ter E(z) which is obtained by solving, e.g., Eq.(24). To <lb/>this end, we just have to set the value of Ω M so that all <lb/>the SNeIa likelihood will be a function of (Ω M , h) only <lb/>and we cannot set any constraint on (Ω b , m ν ). That is <lb/>why we have added the Gaussian priors on ω b and h <lb/>in order to make the likelihood explicitly dependent on <lb/>Ω b . However, since the likelihood is mainly driven by <lb/>the SNeIa term, one can forecast that the constraints on <lb/>(Ω b , m ν ) will be quite weak because of the degeneracy <lb/>being only partially broken. <lb/>C. Results <lb/>In order to maximize the likelihood function (30), we <lb/>run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to <lb/>efficiently explore the parameters 3 space. We use a sin-<lb/>gle chain with ∼ 100000 points reduced to ∼ 3100 after <lb/>burn in cut and thinning. The histograms of the values of <lb/>each parameter are then used to infer the median and the <lb/>mean and the 68 and 95% confidence ranges summarized <lb/>in Table I. The best fit parameters (i.e., the set maximiz-<lb/>ing the likelihood) for the simple MONDian vector model <lb/>turns out to be : <lb/>(Ω b , log m ν , h) = (0.056, 0.54, 0.70) , <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">3 Note that, hereafter, we use log mν rather than mν as neutrino <lb/>mass parameter since this choice allows to explore a wider range. <lb/></note>

			<body>while the standard case gives : <lb/>(Ω b , log m ν , h) = (0.050, 0.55, 0.70) . <lb/>For both models we get χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa /d.o.f. ≃ 1.02 thus in-<lb/>dicating a very good agreement. Moreover, the physical <lb/>baryon density reads ω b = 0.0276 (0.0246) for the simple <lb/>(standard) model in good agreement with the observed <lb/>value well within the 1σ error, while both models predict <lb/>values for h very close to the HST Key Project result. <lb/>It is worth noting that a baryon only universe may be <lb/>safely excluded since the reduced χ 2 values are of order <lb/>2.15 for both cases thus definitevely ruling out models <lb/>with no massive netrinos. <lb/>A look at Table I shows that the constraints on both <lb/>Ω b and log m ν are quite weak. Moreover, the best fit <lb/>values of both parameters radically differ from their me-<lb/>dian values. This is, however, not an unexpected result. <lb/>As we have said, should the prior on ω b be neglected, the <lb/>model should collapse into a two parameter one with Ω M <lb/>replacing the set (Ω b , log m ν ). The prior on ω b thus helps <lb/>in discriminating between the two, but, from the point <lb/>of view of maximizing the likelihood, it is of little help. <lb/>Indeed, the only reliable constraint is on Ω M reading : <lb/>Ω M = 0.28 , Ω M,med = 0.28 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.25, 0.31) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.23, 0.34) , <lb/>for the simple MONDian vector model and <lb/>Ω M = 0.28 , Ω M,med = 0.28 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.25, 0.31) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.22, 0.33) , <lb/>for the standard case. Note that these values are in <lb/>very good agreement with typical estimates from previ-<lb/>ous analyses of comparable datasets [7, 10, 33]. It is also <lb/>worth noting that the results are almost fully indepen-<lb/>dent on the functional expression adopted for F (K) which <lb/>is an expected consequence of the two models matching <lb/>each other in order to fit the same SNeIa Hubble diagram. <lb/>Provided that the above constraints on Ω M are met, we <lb/>can choose whatever value of Ω b (for a given h) and then <lb/>find a corresponding log m ν value giving rise to a model <lb/>with a given likelihood value, i.e. L depends only on <lb/>(Ω M , h). As a consequence, it is therefore not surprising <lb/>that the constraints on (Ω b , log m ν ) are so weak. <lb/>With this caveat in mind, it is nevertheless interesting <lb/>to look at the neutrino mass. Converting the constraints <lb/>on log m ν into constraints on m ν (in eV), we get : <lb/></body>

			<body>m ν = 2.3 , m ν,med = 2.5 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.7, 3.6) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.1, 4.2) , <lb/>for the simple MONDian vector model and <lb/>m ν = 2.0 , m ν,med = 2.2 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.1, 3.4) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.0, 4.4) , <lb/>for the standard case. As yet stated, atmospheric and so-<lb/>lar neutrino experiments have shown that the three fami-<lb/>lies of standard model neutrinos are massive, but they are <lb/>unable to put any constraints on their exact masses be-<lb/>ing only sensitive to mass squared differences. An upper <lb/>limit on the mass may instead be set from the study of the <lb/>tritium β decay. By this method, the Mainz -Troitz ex-<lb/>periment [39] was able to find m ν ≤ 2.2 eV. The median <lb/>m ν values quoted above are smaller than this upper limit, <lb/>while the 68 and 95% confidence ranges do indeed suggest <lb/>that it is possible to fit the data equally well with still <lb/>lighter neutrinos. On the other hand, it is worth stressing <lb/>that such estimates rely on our assumption that three de-<lb/>generate massive neutrinos are present so that their total <lb/>density parameter reads Ω ν = 3m ν /94h 2 . It has, how-<lb/>ever, been claimed [37] that a single sterile neutrino with <lb/>mass in the range 4 -6 eV is better suited to explain the <lb/>results of the Miniboone experiment. Should this be the <lb/>case, the constraints above should be multiplied by three <lb/>thus giving a single sterile neutrino with mass in the 95% <lb/>confidence range (0.3, 12.6) eV. It is worth noting that a <lb/>11 eV sterile neutrino has been indeed advocated [38] in <lb/>order to solve the MOND problems on cluster and cos-<lb/>mological scales. It is therefore tempting to investigate <lb/>whether the results in [38] still hold for our vector models <lb/>since on cluster scales both theories reduce to MOND. <lb/>The MCMC algorithm makes also possible to infer con-<lb/>straints on some interesting derived quantities. To this <lb/>end, one just has to evaluate a given function f (p) for <lb/>each point of the chain and then use the values thus ob-<lb/>tained as yet done for the parameters p.

The upper and lower part of the table refers to the <lb/>simple and standard MONDian vector model respectively. <lb/>As a first issue, let us consider the value of q 0 . Its esti-<lb/>mate is typically model dependent since it comes out as <lb/>a derived quantity given a model parametrization. In <lb/>order to escape this problem, one may resort to cos-<lb/>mographic analyses based only on Taylor expanding the <lb/>scale factor. Using this approach, Cattoën and Visser <lb/>[40] have found values between q 0 = −0.48 ± 0.17 and <lb/>q 0 = −0.75±0.17 depending on the details of the method <lb/>used to fit the SNLS dataset. A similar analysis but us-<lb/>ing the GRBs as distance indicators allowed Capozziello <lb/>and Izzo [41] to find values between q 0 = −0.94 ± 0.30 <lb/>and q 0 = −0.39 ± 0.11 still in accordance with our esti-<lb/>mates. A different approach has been instead adopted by <lb/>Elgarøy and Multamäki [42] advocating a model indepen-<lb/>dent parametrization of q(z). Depending on the SNeIa <lb/>sample used and the parametrization adopted, their best <lb/>fit values for q 0 range between -0.29 and -1.1 in good <lb/>agreement with the estimates in Table II. <lb/>On the contrary, there is some conflict with the previ-<lb/>ous estimates of the transition redshift z T . For instance, <lb/>using the Gold SNeIa sample and linearly expanding q(z), <lb/>Riess et al. [4] found z T = 0.46 ± 0.13 in agreement with <lb/>the updated result z T = 0.49 +0.14 <lb/>−0.07 obtained by Cuhna <lb/>[43] using the Union sample. Although there is a possi-<lb/>ble marginal agreement within the 95% confidence range, <lb/>we nevertheless consider this unsatisfactory result not a <lb/>serious flaw of our models since the estimate of z T is <lb/>strongly model dependent so that it is not possible to <lb/>decide whether the disageement is with the data or with <lb/>the fiducial model used to fit the data. <lb/>Finally, we note that the age of the universe is in <lb/>agreement with previous estimates in the literature. Fit-<lb/>ting the WMAP5 data and the SNLS SNeIa sample <lb/>with a prior on the acoustic peak parameter gives [10] <lb/>t 0 = 13.73 ± 0.12 Gyr in almost perfect agreement with <lb/>the results in Table II. Moreover, the shape of the colour -<lb/>magnitude diagram of globular clusters provides a model <lb/>independent estimate, namely t 0 = 12.6 +3.4 <lb/>−2.6 Gyr [44], <lb/>still in considerable good agreement with our values. <lb/>Summarizing, the very good fits to the SNeIa data <lb/>and the agreement between observed and predicted de-<lb/>rived quantities make us confident that both the simple <lb/>and standard MONDian vector models successfully re-<lb/></body>

PROBING THE HIGH REDSHIFT REGIME <lb/>The SNeIa Hubble diagram and the Gaussian priors <lb/>on ω b and h allow us to test the behaviour of the MON-<lb/>Dian vector models only over the redshift range probed <lb/>by these data. Considering that the farthest SN has red-<lb/>shift z ≃ 1.6, it is worth wondering whether the mod-<lb/>els work well for higher z. To answer this question, we <lb/>change the likelihood function adding a further term : <lb/>L(p) ∝ L low (p) × L dp (p) <lb/>(38) <lb/>with L low (p) the likelihood term related to low redshift <lb/>data given by Eq.(30), while L dp (p) is the distance priors <lb/>dependent term which we detail below. <lb/>A. The distance priors <lb/>While SNeIa probe only the background evolution of <lb/>the universe over a limited redshift range (up to z ≃ 1.5), <lb/>the CMBR anisotropy spectrum and the matter power <lb/>spectrum measured by galaxy surveys make it possible <lb/>to both constrain the dynamics of perturbations and test <lb/>the model up to the last scattering surface. However, <lb/>such a program is both theoretically difficult and com-<lb/>putationally demanding. On the one hand, we must de-<lb/>velop the full theory of perturbations to compute the <lb/>C l coefficients of the multipole expansion of the CMBR <lb/>anisotropies and the matter power spectrum P (k). While <lb/>this is yet done for the standard dark energy models, <lb/>a full perturbation theory for the vector models we are <lb/>considering is still to be developed. On the other hand, <lb/>even for popular dark energy models, computing both the <lb/>C l and P (k) represents a bottleneck for the algorithms <lb/>matching data with theories. Fortunately, many features <lb/>of the CMB and matter power spectra may be expressed <lb/>as a function of a limited subset of quantities which are <lb/>instead easy and straightforward to compute. Motivated <lb/>by this consideration, it has become popular to summa-<lb/>rize the main constraints coming from CMBR and matter <lb/>power spectra in what are defined distance priors 4 . <lb/>In the analysis of the WMAP5 data [10], Komatsu et <lb/>al. demonstrated that most of the information in the <lb/>WMAP power spectrum may be summarized in a set of <lb/>constraints on the following quantities : <lb/>(i.) the physical baryon density : <lb/></body>

			<body>datasets. The median and mean values and 68 and 95% <lb/>confindence ranges are summarized in Table III for both <lb/>the simple and standard MONDian vector model. The <lb/>best fit parameters, i.e. the values of (Ω b , log m ν , h) that <lb/>maximizes the likelihood, are not forced to be equal to <lb/>the median values because of correlations among the pa-<lb/>rameters. Indeed, we find : <lb/>(Ω b , log m ν , h) = (0.0392, −0.038, 0.753) <lb/>for the simple MONDian vector model, while it is : <lb/>(Ω b , log m ν , h) = (0.0387, −0.001, 0.753) <lb/>for the standard case. Both models, however, do not <lb/>offer a good performace in fitting the data. Indeed, for <lb/>the best fit parameters, we get : <lb/>χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa /d.o.f = 1.32 , ω b = 0.0222 , z LS = 1081.7 , <lb/>l A = 300.0 , R = 1.52 , G(z m ) = 1424 , <lb/>for the simple case and <lb/>χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa /d.o.f = 1.31 , ω b = 0.0219 , z LS = 1082.3 , <lb/>l A = 300.4 , R = 1.54 , G(z m ) = 1424 , <lb/>for the standard model. It is immediately clear from the <lb/>unusually high reduced χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa value signals that some-<lb/>thing is going wrong with fitting the SNeIa Hubble dia-<lb/>gram. Indeed, with d.o.f. = N SN eIa −3 = 304, a reduced <lb/>χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa /d.o.f. ≃ 1.3 has just a tiny ∼ 3×10 −5 probability <lb/>to occur so that we can safely conclude that both mod-<lb/>els are not correctly fitting the SNeIa Hubble diagram <lb/>data. This conclusion is further enforced comparing the <lb/>above best fit distance priors whose median values and <lb/>standard deviation 6 are as follows : <lb/>ω b = 0.0228±0.0055 , z LS = 1090.1±0.9 , l A = 301.6±0.7 , <lb/>R = 1.701 ± 0.018 , G(z m ) = 1175 ± 21 . <lb/>While the values of (ω b , z LS , l A ) are in reasonable agree-<lb/>ment, there are strong discrepancies for both the shift R <lb/>and the G(z m ) parameters.

The upper and lower part of the table refers to the <lb/>simple and standard MONDian vector model respectively. <lb/>It is worth investigating why this happens. Actually, <lb/>a hint is given by noticing that the most discrepant pa-<lb/>rameters are those involving E(z) both directly, as for <lb/>G(z m ), or indirectly through an integral, as both R and <lb/>χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa . Taking the ΛCDM model as a comparison, we <lb/>indeed find that both the simple and standard MONDian <lb/>vector models systematically underestimates E(z). As a <lb/>consequence, the dimensionless comoving distance r(z) <lb/>turns out to be overestimated thus leading to µ(z) be-<lb/>coming increasingly higher than the concordance model <lb/>prediction as the redshift increases in accordance with the <lb/>result that µ(z) is larger than µ obs for SNeIa with z &gt; 1. <lb/>This also explains why G(z m ) gets larger than observed, <lb/>while the situation is different with the shift parameter. <lb/>Indeed, according to Eq.(45), a larger r(z) should lead <lb/>to a larger R, while we observe the opposite result. This <lb/>can, however, be easily explained considering that R is <lb/>also proportional to Ω M and we get : <lb/>Ω M = 0.091 , Ω M,med = 0.091 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.089, 0.094) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.086, 0.096) , <lb/>for the simple MONDian vector model and <lb/>Ω M = 0.095 , Ω M,med = 0.095 , <lb/>68% CL : (0.094, 0.097) , <lb/>95% CL : (0.092, 0.098) , <lb/>for the standard case. These values are much smaller <lb/>than the typical Ω M ≃ 0.26 [7, 10, 33] values obtained in <lb/>literature thus explaining why our shift parameter turns <lb/>out to be so small notwithstanding the higher r(z LS ). <lb/>Par x x <lb/>x med <lb/>68% CL <lb/>95% CL <lb/>q0 -0.861 -0.862 (-0.865, -0.858) (-0.869, -0.855) <lb/>zT <lb/>1.71 1.71 <lb/>(1.68, 1.73) <lb/>(1.66, 1.76) <lb/>t0 <lb/>16.93 16.93 (16.84, 17.01) (16.76, 17.10) <lb/>q0 -0.856 -0.856 (-0.859, -0.854) (-0.861, -0.852) <lb/>zT <lb/>1.67 1.67 <lb/>(1.65, 1.68) <lb/>(1.64, 1.70) <lb/>t0 <lb/>16.77 16.77 (16.66, 16.87) (16.60, 16.98) <lb/>TABLE V: Constraints on derived quantities (with t0 in Gyr). <lb/>The upper and lower part of the table refers to the simple and <lb/>standard MONDian vector model respectively. <lb/>For completeness, we also summarize in Table V the <lb/>values of the present day deceleration parameter q 0 , the <lb/>transition redshift z T and the age of the universe t 0 . <lb/>These results strengthen our conclusion that both mod-<lb/>els, while performining well in the low redshift regime, are <lb/>actually quite poor in reproducing data probing higher z. <lb/>Indeed, the values of q 0 are in reasonable agreement with <lb/>the results quoted in Sect. IIIC, even if our q 0 values are <lb/>somewhat extreme. On the contrary, there is a clear dis-<lb/>agreement with the previous estimates of the transition <lb/>redshift z T with our results being very high (also outside <lb/>the range probed by SNeIa Hubble diagram). Such a re-<lb/>sult furtherly signals that indeed the expansion rate and <lb/>hence the transition from acceleration to deceleration of <lb/>our models is too slow. Another evidence in favour of <lb/>this interpretation is provided by t 0 which turns out to <lb/>be in strong disagreement with both the WMAP5 and <lb/>globular clusters estimate. Indeeed, Eq.(37) shows that, <lb/>should we underestimate E(z), the age of the universe <lb/>turns out to be higher which is just what happens for <lb/>both MONDian vector models. <lb/>C. A problem with the models or the data ? <lb/>The large reduced χ 2 <lb/>SN eIa values, the disagreement be-<lb/>tween the best fit predicted and observed distance priors <lb/>and the unacceptably high z T and t 0 results should make <lb/>us conclude that both MONDian vector models are un-<lb/>able to fit both the low and high redshift data. Com-<lb/>paring the results in Table I and III, however, makes it <lb/>evident that the two fitting procedures select very differ-<lb/>ent regions of the parameter space. It is therefore worth <lb/>wondering whether there is a problem with the distance <lb/>priors data rather than with the models. <lb/>To this end, it is worth stressing that, although widely <lb/>used in the recent literature (see, e.g., [7, 10, 33, 48, 49]), <lb/>their estimate is actually model dependent. Indeed, in or-<lb/>der to obtain their central values and covariance matrix, <lb/>one first fits a given model (typically, the concordance <lb/>ΛCDM one) to the full CMBR anisotropy and galaxy <lb/>power spectra dataset using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo <lb/>(MCMC) method to sample the posterior probability. <lb/>This same model is then used to compute the distance <lb/></body>

As correctly <lb/>stressed in [50], this procedure relies on three main as-<lb/>sumptions : <lb/>1. the posterior probability from the CMBR <lb/>anisotropies and galaxy power spectra is cor-<lb/>rectly described by the distance priors, i.e. no <lb/>information is lost when giving away the full <lb/>dataset in favour of the simplified one; <lb/>2. the mean and covariance matrix of the distance pri-<lb/>ors parameters do not change when the model space <lb/>is enlarged, i.e. the choice of the fiducial model does <lb/>not impact the estimate of the priors; <lb/>3. these summary parameters are weakly correlated <lb/>with the input fiducial model parameters so that <lb/>they can be used as independent constraints. <lb/>While the first and third assumptions have indeed been <lb/>verified [48, 50], the second hypothesis can not be fully <lb/>addressed. On the one hand, one could argue that, un-<lb/>less a significative amount of dark energy in the early <lb/>universe is present, all reliable models should match at <lb/>high redshift, when the effect of dark energy fades away. <lb/>As a consequence, using the ΛCDM as a fiducial model <lb/>to compute quantities that mainly depend on the high <lb/>redshift behaviour should not affect the final estimate. <lb/>However, even if the background evolution could be the <lb/>same, it is still possible that the dynamics of perturbation <lb/>is radically different as is the case with modified gravity <lb/>theories. This is indeed what also happens for the MON-<lb/>Dian vector models we are considering. Fixing the model <lb/>parameters to the best fit values from the fit to the low <lb/>redshift data only, we can easily compare the luminosity <lb/>distance with that for a fiducial ΛCDM scenario. As ex-<lb/>pected (since they both reproduce the same data), the <lb/>two can hardly be discriminated over the range probed, <lb/>while the Hubble parameter only differ by a few percent. <lb/>While the background evolution is therefore comparable, <lb/>perturbations evolve in a completely different way be-<lb/>cause of the presence of the vector field. As such, one can <lb/>not be sure that the information contained in the CMBR <lb/>spectrum may still be summarized in the distance priors <lb/>quantities as for the ΛCDM model.

As a conservative conclusion, we are therefore <lb/>forced to only report the results being unable to decide <lb/>whether the problem is with the data or with the fiducial <lb/>model used to retrieve them. <lb/>D. The effective EoS and the high z limit <lb/>An alternative way to compare the proposed MON-<lb/>Dian vector models with standard dark energy models in <lb/>both the low and high redshift regime may be obtained by <lb/>considering the effective EoS. Indeed, from the point of <lb/>view of the background evolution, our models are equiv-<lb/>alent to a cosmological scenario made out of dust matter <lb/>and a dark energy with an effective EoS given by : <lb/>1 + w ef f (z) = <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>d ln E(z) <lb/>d ln (1 + z) <lb/>− <lb/>Ω M (1 + z) 3 <lb/>E 2 (z) <lb/>× 1 − <lb/>Ω M (1 + z) 3 <lb/>E 2 (z) <lb/>−1 <lb/>, <lb/>(50) <lb/>so that the dark energy density parameter reads : <lb/>Ω DE (z) = <lb/>1 − Ω M <lb/>E 2 (z) <lb/>exp 3 <lb/>z <lb/>0 <lb/>1 + w ef f (z ′ ) <lb/>1 + z ′ <lb/>dz ′ .

Note that the value of <lb/>Ω M in Eqs.(50) and (51) is related to Ω b and m ν through <lb/>Eq.(36) so that changing m ν is the same as varying Ω M . <lb/>Both figures shows that the value of m ν set the present <lb/>day EoS with w ef f (z = 0) increasing as a function of m ν , <lb/>even if there is a saturation at small m ν as can be easily <lb/>understood considering that the smaller is m ν , the less <lb/></body>

			<body>is the impact of massive neutrinos in the energy budget. <lb/>It is worth noting that for log m ν ≃ 0.5, it is w ef f (z = <lb/>0) ≃ −1.0 and dw ef f /dz takes very small values over <lb/>the redshift range (0, 1), i.e. we recover (for both cases) <lb/>a present day cosmological constant. It is therefore not <lb/>surprising that the fit to the SNeIa dataset points towards <lb/>such values of log m ν since these make both MONDian <lb/>vector models as similar as possible to the ΛCDM one <lb/>over the range probed by SNeIa themselves. <lb/>On the contrary, in the high redshift regime, the neu-<lb/>trino mass only plays a marginal role in determining the <lb/>value of w ef f (z) which stays almost constant at value <lb/>close to the dust one w ef f = 0, i.e. the effective EoS <lb/>approximately tracks the matter term. However, the <lb/>amount of dark energy is different depending on m ν with <lb/>lower values of the neutrino density giving rise to a larger <lb/>Ω DE (z) in the high z regime. Such a behaviour is some-<lb/>what counterintuitive since one expects that the effective <lb/>dark energy fades away in the early universe in order to <lb/>recover the matter dominated epoch. Actually, one must <lb/>take into account that our matter term is made out of <lb/>baryons and massive neutrinos only. The lower is the <lb/>neutrino mass, the higher must be the contribute of the <lb/>effective dark energy (that in this regime behaves as mat-<lb/>ter being w ef f ≃ 0) to compensate for the missing cold <lb/>dark matter. Such a result can also be forecasted going <lb/>back to Eq.(9) and noting that, for our best fit models, <lb/>we find η &gt;&gt; 1 so that, for z &gt;&gt; 1, it is K &gt;&gt; 1 too. <lb/>Let us then consider the simple MONDian vector model. <lb/>Inserting Eq.(22) and taking the limit for ηE(z) &gt;&gt; 1, <lb/>we approximately get : <lb/>Ω M (1 + z) 3 ≃ E 2 + ln ηE ≃ E 2 <lb/>so that we indeed recover the usual expression for the <lb/>Hubble parameter for a matter dominated universe with <lb/>Ω M the total (baryons and massive neutrinos) matter <lb/>term (having neglected radiation). From the point of <lb/>view of the effective dark energy formalism, if we reduce <lb/>the neutrinos contribution, we must add a further term <lb/>acting as matter and this is indeed provide by the effec-<lb/>tive dark energy. This also explains why Ω DE (z &gt;&gt; 1) <lb/>increases decreasing log m ν . A similar discussion also ap-<lb/>plies to the standard MONDian vector models so that in <lb/>both cases the final scenario is the one of a universe where <lb/>the matter term disappears to be replaced by a dark en-<lb/>ergy fluid acting approximately as matter. This explains <lb/>why the inclusion of the distance priors (probing the high <lb/>z regime) pushes the best fit towards smaller log m ν since, <lb/>in this case, both MONDian models recovers the usual <lb/>Friedmann models which are known to successfully fit <lb/>these high redshift probes. As yet said, however, de-<lb/>creasing log m ν makes w ef f (z = 0) = −1 thus worsening <lb/>the fit to the SNeIa Hubble diagram. <lb/>V. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>The astonishing successes of MOND on the galactic <lb/>scales and the emergence of a relativistic theory playing <lb/>the role of its counterpart on cosmological scales have re-<lb/>newed the interest in the search for a possible common <lb/>explanation of both dark matter and dark energy phe-<lb/>nomenology. Vector theories are another way of recov-<lb/>ering MOND in the low energy limit so that it is worth <lb/>wondering whether they can also offer an elegant way <lb/>of speeding up the cosmic evolution without the need of <lb/>any dark energy source. The ignorance about the form <lb/>of the vector field Lagrangian may be bypassed relying <lb/>on the link between the function F (K) and the MOND <lb/>interpolating function µ(a/a 0 ). Since dark matter is no <lb/>more present, one should postulate the presence of mas-<lb/>sive neutrinos in order to fill the gap between the total <lb/>matter density parameter and the baryons density alone. <lb/>Moreover, such massive neutrinos are also advocated in <lb/>order to reconcile the results of solar and atmospheric <lb/>neutrino experiments on the flavour mixing with the pre-<lb/>dictions of the standard model of particle physics. <lb/>Motivated by these considerations, we have there-<lb/>fore investigated the viability of two different MONDian <lb/>vector models characterized by F (K) expressions corre-<lb/>sponding to the simple and standard MOND interpo-<lb/>lating function. To this aim, we have first fitted them <lb/>against the Union SNeIa Hubble diagram using Gaussian <lb/>priors on the physical baryon density ω b and the present <lb/>day Hubble constant h in order to break the (Ω b , log m ν ) <lb/>degeneracy. Both models performs quite well giving a <lb/>perfect agreement with the SNeIa data and previous es-<lb/>timates of the total matter density parameter Ω M , the <lb/>deceleration parameter q 0 and the age of the universe t 0 . <lb/>Moreover, the (weak) constraints on the neutrino mass <lb/>are consistent with the upper limits set by the Mainz -<lb/>Troitz experiment assuming three families of degenerate <lb/>neutrinos. Should, instead, a single sterile neutrino be <lb/>the mass dominant component, its estimated mass is in <lb/>agreement with the constraints from the Miniboone ex-<lb/>periment also falling in the right range advocated to solve <lb/>MOND problems on cluster scales. <lb/>In order to investigate the high redshift behaviour of <lb/>the models, we have repeated the likelihood analysis <lb/>adding the extended set of distance priors. It turns out <lb/>that both models should be rejected since they provide <lb/>now a poor fit to the SNeIa data and strongly disagree <lb/>with the observed shift R and G(z m ) parameters. Dis-<lb/>tance priors are, however, estimated through a model <lb/>dependent procedure so that one can not safely rely on <lb/>them to exclude models that are radically different from <lb/>the fiducial one used to extract the constraints on R and <lb/>G(z m ). As a consequence, we are unable to conclude <lb/>whether the disagreement is a failure of the MONDian <lb/>vector models or an expected outcome of the different <lb/>evolution of perturbations with respect to usual dark en-<lb/>ergy models because of the action of the vector field. <lb/>It is worth remembering that the search for a cosmolog-<lb/></body>

Applying a <lb/>procedure which is simply the generalization of the clas-<lb/>sical derivation of the Friedmann equation from the New-<lb/>tonian force law, but now starting from the MOND force <lb/>law, Lue &amp; Starkman [51] derived an expression for the <lb/>Hubble parameter without referring to any underlying <lb/>modified gravity theory. Defining g(x) = H 2 /H 2 <lb/>0 and <lb/>x = Ω M (1 + z) 3 , they indeed find : <lb/>g(x) = <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/>(β ln x + c 2 )x 2/3 x &lt; x c <lb/>x + c 1 x 2/3 <lb/>x &gt; x c <lb/>(52) <lb/>with c 1 = c 2 + 3β[ln (3β) − 1]. Moroever, they also pro-<lb/>posed a modified (by hand) version of this expression to <lb/>better account for the low redshift behaviour : <lb/>g(x) = <lb/> <lb/>      <lb/>      <lb/>Ω Λ <lb/>x ≤ 0.1 <lb/>βx 2/3 ln (1 + z) <lb/>0.1 ≤ x ≤ (3β) 3 <lb/>x + 3β[ln (3β) − 1]x 2/3 x &gt; (3β) 3 <lb/>. <lb/>(53) <lb/>Following [51], we set (β, x c , Ω Λ ) = (15, 7 × 10 4 , 0.7) with <lb/>c 2 = 0 and show in Figs. 3 and 4 how Eqs.(52) and (53) <lb/>compares to the standard and simple MONDian vector <lb/>models. As it is better appreciated from the right pan-<lb/>els, both Eqs.(52) and (53) agree reasonably well with <lb/>the g(x) expression of our MONDian models for very <lb/>high x, that is in the early universe.

On the contrary, for small x, i.e. in the very <lb/>low z regime, only the modified expression (53) matches <lb/>reasonably well those for the standard and simple MON-<lb/>Dian vector models as a consequence of both mimicking <lb/>an effective cosmological constant. In the intermediate <lb/>region, however, matching the Lue &amp; Starkman mod-<lb/>els to our own is impossible signalling that the strategy <lb/>adopted by these authors is unable to trace the tran-<lb/>sition region to General Relativity.

This is not the case for vector theories [52] so <lb/>that the two approaches differ from the very beginning. <lb/>As yet quoted in the introduction, much interest has <lb/>been devoted to the TeVeS theory as a relativistic MOND <lb/>counterpart. In particular, Skordis et al. [53] has also <lb/>investigated the growth of structure in TeVeS also com-<lb/>puting the CMBR anisotropy spectrum. It turned out <lb/>that the inclusion of a cosmological constant term and of <lb/>massive neutrinos with m ν ≃ 2 eV may lead to a reason-<lb/>ably good agreement with the data, although a detailed <lb/>fitting has not been performed. Since both the vector <lb/>and scalar fields present in TeVeS do not contribute sig-<lb/>nificantly to the dynamics, it is likely that this TeVeS + Λ <lb/>model matches well both the SNeIa Hubble diagram and <lb/>the distance priors. However, comparing the Skordis et <lb/>al. model to our MONDian vector theories is not possible <lb/>given the radical differences betwee the two approaches. <lb/>Indeed, TeVeS needs the scalar field to act as a dark <lb/>matter like term on galactic scales, while the vector field <lb/>boosts the growth of perturbations during the Λ driven <lb/>background expansion. On the contrary, in our approach, <lb/>the vector models modify the low energy limit Poisson <lb/>equation thus recovering the MOND -like behaviour, but <lb/>also originates the cosmic speed up. In a sense, our ap-<lb/>proach is more economical claiming for the lowest possible <lb/>number of ingredients. <lb/>The positive results obtained in the low redshift regime <lb/>may be considered only as a ground zero level analysis. <lb/>Indeed, fitting the SNeIa Hubble diagram only tells us <lb/>that the two considered MONDian vector models predict <lb/>the correct background evolution over the redshift range <lb/>probed by the data, i.e. up to z ∼ 1.5. Needless to <lb/>say, more tests are needed in order to assess the viabil-<lb/>ity of these models. On one hand, we can still investigate <lb/>the background evolution by extending the redshift range <lb/>through the use of the GRBs Hubble diagram [54]. On <lb/>the other hand, a more significative and demanding test <lb/>should be fitting both the galaxy power spectrum and <lb/>the CMBR dataset. However, both these tasks are quite <lb/>daunting from the theoretical point of view. Indeed, as <lb/>far as we know, the CMBR spectrum has never been <lb/>computed for the class of vector theories we are consid-<lb/>ering so that one should first write down the full set of <lb/>perturbation equations to then modify a numerical code <lb/></body>

			<body>like CAMB [55]. Somewhat easier (even if still difficult) <lb/>is to deal with the problem of growth of structures in <lb/>vector models. Indeed, such a study has although been <lb/>performed in [56] where the authors considered a simple <lb/>power -law choice for F (K). Although a detailed fitting <lb/>to the data was not performed, these authors have convic-<lb/>ingly shown that the new degrees of freedom sourced by <lb/>the vector field may indeed boost the growth of structure <lb/>even in absence of any dark matter. This result is a good <lb/>starting point for testing our proposed MONDian vec-<lb/>tor models provided one accordingly changes the F (K) <lb/>function and introduces massive neutrinos into the game. <lb/>Note that, since we want to recover MOND on galactic <lb/>scales, we are postulating no cold dark matter so that the <lb/>observed galaxy power spectrum should be matched to <lb/>the predicted one with a bias parameter determined by <lb/>the clustering properties of the massive (sterile or not) <lb/>neutrino. Therefore, such a test is particularly powerful <lb/>and worth addressing as the next step of our analysis. <lb/>It is worth noting that help investigating the viability <lb/>of our MONDian vector models may come from a non <lb/>astrophysical experiment. Indeed, one of the key ingre-<lb/>dients in both MONDian vector models is the presence <lb/>of massive neutrinos with m ν ∼ 2 eV. The KATRIN <lb/>experiment [57] on the tritium β decay should be able <lb/>to constrain the electron neutrino mass with a sensitity <lb/>of ∼ 0.2 eV. Should this experiment indeed find that <lb/>neutrinos are less massive than, e.g., ∼ 1 eV, our model <lb/>could be in serious trouble unless one assumes that a <lb/>single massive sterile neutrino does indeed exist. <lb/>As a final remark, one could note that we have titled <lb/>our paper with a question so that the reader could now <lb/>claim for an answer. Unfortunately, because of the un-<lb/>certainties on the use of the distance priors and the small <lb/>redshift range probed, the unique answer we can give af-<lb/>ter our analysis is only a (somewhat frustrating) maybe. <lb/></body>
