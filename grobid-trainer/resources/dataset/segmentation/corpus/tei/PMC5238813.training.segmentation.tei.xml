It is <lb/>vital to have in-depth understanding of the material properties and governing parameters of its <lb/>processes in response to different formulations. Understanding the mentioned aspects will allow <lb/>tighter control of the process, leading to implementation of quality-by-design (QbD) practices. <lb/>Computational intelligence (CI) offers an opportunity to create empirical models that can be <lb/>used to describe the system and predict future outcomes in silico. CI models can help explore <lb/>the behavior of input parameters, unlocking deeper understanding of the system. This research <lb/>endeavor presents CI models to predict the porosity of tablets created by roll-compacted binary <lb/>mixtures, which were milled and compacted under systematically varying conditions. CI models <lb/>were created using tree-based methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and symbolic regres-<lb/>sion trained on an experimental data set and screened using root-mean-square error (RMSE) <lb/>scores. The experimental data were composed of proportion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) <lb/>(in percentage), granule size fraction (in micrometers), and die compaction force (in kilonewtons) <lb/>as inputs and porosity as an output. The resulting models show impressive generalization abil-<lb/>ity, with ANNs (normalized root-mean-square error [NRMSE] =1%) and symbolic regression <lb/>(NRMSE =4%) as the best-performing methods, also exhibiting reliable predictive behavior when <lb/>presented with a challenging external validation data set (best achieved symbolic regression: <lb/>NRMSE =3%). Symbolic regression demonstrates the transition from the black box modeling <lb/>paradigm to more transparent predictive models. Predictive performance and feature selection <lb/>behavior of CI models hints at the most important variables within this factor space. <lb/>Keywords: computational intelligence, artificial neural network, symbolic regression, feature <lb/>selection, die compaction, porosity <lb/></front>

		<body>Introduction <lb/>Pharmaceutical companies rely on solid dosage forms, which constitute a majority of <lb/>the total manufactured and marketed product. Powder characteristics, manufacturing <lb/>process parameters, and various other tangible entities have profound effects on the <lb/>quality of a solid dosage form in a complex way. The quality of a solid dosage form, <lb/>among other factors, can be assessed based on its hardness and porosity, which can <lb/>be used as indirect measurements of its capability and rate to dissolve. 1 In most cases, <lb/>the complexity of relationships among the possible material parameters and upstream <lb/>processes diminishes the understanding of the system as a whole. <lb/>Porosity, known as the ratio of volume of void space to the bulk volume and gen-<lb/>erally represented as a percentage, is an important property that controls the micro-<lb/>structure of the tablet during compression. It can assist in the understanding of the <lb/>dispersion mechanism, behavior after ingestion, moisture penetration, and with certain <lb/></body>

		<body>prerequisites, even bioavailability. Porosity measurements <lb/>are also known to be relevant indicators of drug stability. 2 <lb/>The effect of shape and porosity of granules has been stud-<lb/>ied by Johansson and Alderborn, 3 suggesting that stronger <lb/>tablets are formed when granules with irregular porosity are <lb/>compressed. Theoretically, the porosity of a tablet can be a <lb/>predictor of its dissolution behavior as well. 4 <lb/>Previous works on this topic have revealed that porosity <lb/>influences tablet strength; lactose tablets with larger pores <lb/>were weak 5-7 and similar relationships were observed with <lb/>other excipients such as glucose and mannitol. 7,8 The impor-<lb/>tance of porosity as an indirect measurement of dissolution <lb/>was demonstrated using rate of water uptake, and solvent <lb/>penetration was studied in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) <lb/>tablets with different porosities. Results showed that tablets <lb/>with 10% and 15% porosity take up water much faster (30 s) <lb/>and expand by up to 50% of original thickness, while tablets <lb/>with 5% porosity are much slower in water uptake behavior <lb/>(148 s), in addition to showing less expansion. 9 The corre-<lb/>lation of porosity with die compaction force has been well <lb/>studied in the past. 10,11 It was explained that tablets made from <lb/>pharmaceutical powders do not exhibit the quasi-exponential <lb/>trend proposed by Heckel 12 for evolution of porosity against <lb/>pressure. Pharmaceutical powders exhibit plastic deformation <lb/>properties, while Heckel&apos;s model works well with metal-<lb/>lic powders. 11 Tablet brittleness has been described as an <lb/>exponential growth function of porosity using a diverse set <lb/>of pharmaceutical tablets by Gong et al. 13 <lb/>Data-driven empirical models established using compu-<lb/>tational intelligence (CI) methods can be used as surrogates <lb/>to run in silico experiments to predict porosity. Use of CI <lb/>offers reduction in experiments, leading to cost and time sav-<lb/>ings and broader understanding of the system. CI tools have <lb/>been used in works addressing the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s <lb/>various problems, including tensile strength, porosity, and <lb/>dissolution problems. 14-18 <lb/>Generally, modeling and simulation (M-and-S) is a huge <lb/>area of science, in which various paradigms of modeling are <lb/>used, mostly based on well-established theory. In pharma-<lb/>ceutical sciences, a broad area of molecular modeling, using <lb/>ab initio techniques such as molecular docking offers profound <lb/>examples of such an approach. 19-21 However, when no such <lb/>theory is present, only empirical modeling is a suitable alterna-<lb/>tive, in particular with data-driven modeling in focus. <lb/>The aim of this work is to create data-driven intelligent <lb/>models using well-known and established approaches to <lb/>compute the porosity of tablets based on average granule size, <lb/>proportion of MCC, and die compaction force. Furthermore, <lb/>it aims to show that CI models can be represented in the <lb/>form of an equation as a result of modeling through sym-<lb/>bolic regression -a shift from the black box paradigm to <lb/>transparency. Last, this work attempts to dissect CI models <lb/>to ascertain which of the input variables are more important <lb/>to predict porosity. The models are based on experimental <lb/>data generated by Perez-Gandarillas et al. 22 <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>ethics <lb/>Since this study is conducted purely in silico, no ethics review <lb/>was sought or granted here. <lb/>Training data <lb/>The experimental data set contains records of binary tablets <lb/>made from MCC and lactose. Powder mixtures were roll <lb/>compacted under constant conditions. Ribbons were milled to <lb/>produce granules of three different size ranges (315-500; 630-<lb/>800, and 800-1,000 μm). In continuation of the process, the <lb/>feed powders (binary mixtures) and their granules from each <lb/>size range were die compacted using six different die compac-<lb/>tion forces. The experiments were done in triplicates. 22 <lb/>The tablets were characterized through the porosity. <lb/>Therefore, the porosity is an outcome (Table 1A). After <lb/>ejection, the tablet dimensions (diameter and thickness) were <lb/>measured with a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Takatsu-ku, <lb/>Japan), and tablet mass was weighed with an electronic bal-<lb/>ance (CP224S). These data were used to calculate the relative <lb/>density (ρ r ) of each tablet, as follows: <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>r <lb/>t <lb/>= <lb/>4 <lb/>2 <lb/>m <lb/>hD <lb/>π <lb/>(1) <lb/>where m is the mass, h is the tablet thickness, D is the tablet <lb/>diameter, and ρ t is the true density of each binary mixture. <lb/>Once the relative density is obtained, the porosity (ε) is <lb/>calculated as follows: <lb/>ε <lb/>ρ <lb/>= − <lb/>1 r <lb/>(2) <lb/>Validation data <lb/>An additional data set from single-powder tableting experiments <lb/>was used to validate the CI models. The data set is explained in <lb/>Perez-Gandarillas et al. 23 The validation set is composed of data <lb/>generated by varying roll compaction over two sets of tooling <lb/>(cheek plates and sealed rim rolls) and two roll compaction <lb/>forces (4 kN/cm and 8 kN/cm). The ribbons were milled under <lb/>constant settings and granules were compacted under seven <lb/></body>

            <body>different die compaction forces (Table 1B). Variation in roll <lb/>compactor tooling and roll compaction/die compaction forces <lb/>introduces a challenge to trained CI models. <lb/>Model training <lb/>The models were built using three different approaches: <lb/>1. Tree-based predictive models <lb/>i. Decision trees (Cubist) <lb/>ii. Random forests (randomForest) <lb/>2. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) (monmlp) <lb/>3. Symbolic regression (rgp). <lb/>Extensive combinations of algorithm parameters in all <lb/>the approaches were tried. The data set was divided into <lb/>10 folds, where nine of the folds were used for training and <lb/>one for testing. Tenfold cross-validation (10cv) is a renowned <lb/>method to create a &quot;real-world&quot; depiction of a problem from <lb/>the data representing it. 24 Models were selected based on their <lb/>RMSE values calculated according to Equation 1. The RMSE <lb/>values are a measure of the differences between the predicted <lb/>and the observed values and are completely independent of <lb/>the modeling technique. Hence, they are reliable and widely <lb/>accepted measures for evaluating a model. R statistical envi-<lb/>ronment was used to create the models. <lb/>RMSE <lb/>pred obs <lb/>= <lb/>∑ <lb/>− <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>n <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>(3) <lb/>where &quot;pred&quot; is the predicted value from the models, &quot;obs&quot; <lb/>is the observed value from the experiments, and &quot;n&quot; is the <lb/>total number of test cases. <lb/>The RMSE values were normalized using Equation 2. <lb/>NRMSE <lb/>RMSE <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>× <lb/>X <lb/>X <lb/>max <lb/>min <lb/>100 <lb/>(4) <lb/>where RMSE was calculated in Equation 1, X max and X min are <lb/>the highest and the lowest observed values for the outcome <lb/>in the data set, respectively. <lb/>CI methods <lb/>Decision trees -cubist <lb/>Cubist is a tree-based modeling approach wherein a linear <lb/>model is fit iteratively, resulting in a set of linear models at <lb/>each node starting from the root to the last node of the tree. <lb/>Cubist is an ensemble-based technique. All variables that are <lb/>covered by a linear function at a single node are then dis-<lb/>carded from the future iterations for that particular tree. This <lb/>process is recursively continued until all the input variables <lb/>have been covered by a single or a set of rules in a tree. This <lb/>is also known as the separate-and-conquer approach. At every <lb/>step, the response of the model is analyzed and adjusted to <lb/>be used by the next model, until the final model is achieved. <lb/>The final prediction is a simple average of the predictions <lb/>from each tree in the ensemble. 25 <lb/>random forest <lb/>Random forests are well known tree-based models. One <lb/>model is shaped by numerous trees in the collection. Indepen-<lb/>dent trees are generated based on sample data randomly taken <lb/>out of the training data set. Errors exhibited by individual <lb/>trees are collectively representative of the generalization <lb/>error of the randomForest model. 26 An extensive search for <lb/>the best architecture was carried out using a 10cv scheme, <lb/>followed by training of the best-performing architecture on <lb/>the full data set. <lb/>anns -monmlp <lb/>Monmlp is the implementation of ANN in R.

            <body>enhanced by the nonlinear minimization algorithm (nlm) for <lb/>training. Neural networks imitate the structure of the human <lb/>brain, whereby information is passed on between neurons <lb/>in the form of synapses. Monmlp allows two hidden layers <lb/>of neurons, with hyperbolic tangent and linear activation as <lb/>transfer functions. 27 In monmlp, signals move forward from <lb/>the input layer through sigmoid neurons before reaching the <lb/>linear output layer. <lb/>Neurons in each layer consist of N inputs (X i ), which <lb/>multiplies by the proper generated weight element (W i,j ) for <lb/>the layer named j. Summation of the weighted inputs plus bias <lb/>(b j ) produces the input (n j ) for the activation function, using <lb/>which the output of each neuron (y i ) can be calculated. <lb/>Moreover, different activation functions, such as hyper-<lb/>bolic tangent sigmoid (TAN-SIG) transfer function, loga-<lb/>rithm sigmoid (LOGSIG) transfer function, and pure linear <lb/>(PURELIN) transfer function, are the potential transfer <lb/>functions that can be used in each layer. 28 The neural net-<lb/>work package monmlp was run extensively to find the best-<lb/>performing network architecture with 10cv. The whole data <lb/>set was used to retrain the model on the best architecture. <lb/>symbolic regression by rgp <lb/>Genetic programming (GP) is a bioinspired algorithm based <lb/>on evolution principles to solve complex problems. A com-<lb/>plex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler problems <lb/>with random solutions. These solutions are then evolved <lb/>through the biologically mimicked process of variation and <lb/>selection until the end condition is reached or a workable <lb/>solution is generated. Thus, rgp is an implementation of GP <lb/>methods in the R environment. 29 Package rgp results are <lb/>simple representations of the problem without being exposed <lb/>to a priori information. rgp offers various options for initial-<lb/>ization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. <lb/>GP implements a tree structure representation to show the <lb/>mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of <lb/>two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). 30 <lb/>The function set can be chosen through the operators {+, -, <lb/>*, /, sin, cos, log, abs}, mathematical functions, conditional <lb/>statements, or even the user-defined operators. In addition, <lb/>the terminal set includes constants and model variables. 31,32 <lb/>To find the best solution, different runs were conducted <lb/>by iterating over GP tuning parameters. The most important <lb/>tuning parameters are maximum size of the chromosome, <lb/>the number of generations, and population size. 30 The size <lb/>of the chromosome, which governs the maximum length of <lb/>the equation, was varied from 5 to 100. The population size <lb/>was set to 1,000, and the number of generations was set to <lb/>500 million evolution steps divided into 100 stages. <lb/>These equations can be optimized by different strategies. 33,34 <lb/>For this experiment, equations were created on the whole <lb/>data set, and then selected ones were optimized using the <lb/>simulated annealing (SANN) algorithm, followed by a quasi-<lb/>Newton (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno [BFGS]) <lb/>method. 35,36 <lb/>independent feature selection by fscaret <lb/>The package fscaret allows semiautomatic feature selection, <lb/>working as a wrapper for the caret package in R. Fscaret <lb/>is specialized for in silico feature selection experiments, <lb/>whereby approximately 120 different packages are used to <lb/>fit models. 37 Input feature ranking is extracted from trained <lb/>models by using weighted averages. Sum of squared errors <lb/>(SSE), mean squared errors (MSEs), and RMSEs are used to <lb/>evaluate models. fscaret has been successfully implemented <lb/>in recent studies. 38,39 <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Approximately 10,000 models with different architectures <lb/>were developed using the CI methods mentioned herein. <lb/>External validation of the models was done using a data <lb/>set on tableting with MCC under different roll compaction <lb/>conditions. <lb/>Model performance <lb/>Results for best models from all the different CI methods are <lb/>shown in Table 2. All CI methods perform well on the data <lb/>sets. The multiple linear regression (MLR) model, shown <lb/>in Table 3, does not represent the process adequately (15% <lb/>error), suggesting that nonlinearity needs to be addressed <lb/>with a robust method.

            <body>model, decision trees, ANNs, and GP algorithms were used. <lb/>RGP was performed as an early-stage experiment at this <lb/>point. Nonetheless, RGP shows results comparable to those <lb/>from other methods, which is evidence that evolutionary <lb/>computational methods are quite robust and can fit complex <lb/>data well. <lb/>ann model <lb/>ANNs show best 10cv generalization results among all the <lb/>experiments conducted, although they fail to maintain the <lb/>performance on the external data set. A simple network of <lb/>two hidden layers of 13 and 11 nodes, respectively, with <lb/>10 ensembles and 100 iterations was found out to be the <lb/>best-performing architecture. Hyperbolic tangent was used <lb/>as the transfer function within the ANN (Figure 2). <lb/>Recent works 39,40 demonstrate the ANN as a much coveted <lb/>CI modeling tool. ANNs show plausible results in super-<lb/>vised learning, a behavior that can be attributed to the high <lb/>generalization ability of the ANNs. Moreover, 10cv ANN <lb/>models exhibit a meager 1% normalized root-mean-square <lb/>error (NRMSE) (Table 1). Although ANNs are robust, are <lb/>widely used, and have great generalization capabilities, they <lb/>are generally black-box models. The resulting ANN models <lb/>cannot be dissected with certainty to establish how different <lb/>input features are interacting with each other to predict <lb/>porosity. Furthermore, ANN models are unstable where <lb/>retraining could lead to a slightly different understanding <lb/>of the system. The source of instability and inconsistency <lb/>lies within the design and strategy used to train an ANN. <lb/>Weights in the ANN are generated at random to expedite <lb/>the learning process while the process of learning itself <lb/>is deterministic. Hence, the randomness introduced while <lb/>generating the weights could lead to a completely different <lb/>model after retraining. <lb/>symbolic regression <lb/>GP is a stable, a transparent method that can offer structural <lb/>insights into the models. Symbolic regression exhibits a good <lb/>model fit (4% 10cv error, 3% external). The advantage of <lb/>symbolic regression is that the result can be represented in <lb/>the form of a mathematical formula. 41 The model for poros-<lb/>ity can be represented as in Equation 4.

Tablets were made with MCC. The <lb/>external data set was particularly challenging for the models <lb/>because roll compaction conditions were kept constant in <lb/>the training data set while being systematically changed in <lb/>the external data set. Table 1 shows the results of external <lb/>validation. The models were able to predict porosity with <lb/>substantial accuracy using unseen input data. The external <lb/>data set is composed of experiments with two different roll <lb/>compactor tooling (cheek plates and rim rolls) and two dif-<lb/>ferent roll compaction forces (4 kN and 8 kN) for each. The <lb/>variety of roll compactor settings introduces variance in the <lb/>external data set unknown to the trained models. Although <lb/>CI systems are not known for their extrapolation abilities, 42 <lb/>the models presented herein are able to extrapolate success-<lb/>fully in a small range. Regardless of the complexity in the <lb/>external data set, the rgp model represented by Equation 4 <lb/>makes accurate predictions of the test cases from all different <lb/>tooling and force conditions (Figure 4). Table 4 shows the <lb/>levels of accuracy of prediction for the external validation <lb/>data set. Non-roll-compacted powder is predicted with the <lb/>most accuracy (NRMSE: 7%), followed by prediction of roll <lb/>compaction using rim rolls at 4 kN (NRMSE: 9%). <lb/>Model description <lb/>Further analysis of trained CI models gives interesting <lb/>insights into the governing parameters within this tableting <lb/>experiment. <lb/>Feature selection by gP <lb/>Symbolic regression model exhibits feature selection <lb/>behavior. The resulting model represents two inputs in the <lb/>equation as compared to the original three inputs presented <lb/>to it while training. Feature selection process discards the <lb/>input variables which are not contributing decisively toward <lb/>the outcome; in this case, the average granule fraction size. <lb/>Considering granule fraction range as a disposable input <lb/>characteristic for the outcome of porosity is contrary to pre-<lb/>vious works, 43 but justified within the range of this training <lb/>data set. 22 A comparison between the GP model and the ANN <lb/>model shows that the average granule fraction size does not <lb/>exercise significant effect on the outcome (Figure 5), also <lb/>supported by MLR (Table 3). ANN model does not perform <lb/>feature selection on its own and is bound to use all three <lb/>inputs in the final model. Therefore, GP model discarding <lb/>the average granule fraction size makes it less complex and <lb/>improves performance on the external data set (Table 2). <lb/>Further RSM analysis based on the GP equation shows <lb/>that variation in the amount of MCC does not have a profound <lb/>effect on the porosity of the tablet, while an increase in the <lb/>die compaction force considerably reduces the porosity of <lb/>tablets (Figure 6), a behavior that can be attributed to particle <lb/>rearrangement followed by plastic deformation during the <lb/>compression stage. 44 <lb/>Feature selection on the external data set to <lb/>establish the surplus of discarded variables <lb/>Plausible performance of the trained CI models on a signifi-<lb/>cantly different external data set could be an occurrence of <lb/>chance.

            <body>Conclusion <lb/>CI models for MCC-based tablets are presented herein. The <lb/>models have been rigorously tested internally using 10cv and <lb/>then externally validated by using a challenging data set. The <lb/>models exhibit reliable prediction behavior, with the best <lb/>achieved 10cv-NRMSE of 1% on using ANNs. The models <lb/>also exhibit understanding of the tableting process within the <lb/>design space. The equation for porosity is presented as the <lb/>result of symbolic regression models with 10cv-NRMSE of <lb/>4% and external validation NRMSE of 3%. Presentation of <lb/>CI models in the form of an equation makes them transpar-<lb/>ent to scrutiny and shows how the input variables interact <lb/>with each other plus contribute toward the specific outcome <lb/>of porosity. Contrary to common knowledge, roll compac-<lb/>tion parameters such as tooling and compression force do <lb/>not influence the porosity of tablets. Such conclusions are <lb/>confined to the local design space and cannot be treated as <lb/>general rules governing the tableting process. <lb/></body>
