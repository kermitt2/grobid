In plants, this technique is highly efficient since it is relatively easy to grow and screen the <lb/>phenotypes of hundreds or thousands of individuals. The cost-efficiency and ease of data <lb/>production afforded by next-generation sequencing techniques have created new opportunities <lb/>for mapping induced mutations. The principles of genetic mapping remain the same. However, <lb/>the details have changed, which allows for rapid mapping of causal mutations. Current mapping <lb/>tools are often not user-friendly and complicated or require extensive preparation steps. To <lb/>simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next <lb/>generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Identifying genetic mutations that underlie phenotypic changes is essential for understanding a <lb/>wide variety of biological processes. A forward genetic screen is one of the most powerful tools <lb/>for searching for such mutations. Spontaneous and induced mutations have been used to identify <lb/>genes underlying aberrant phenotypes for over one hundred years (Morgan 1910). In the <lb/>common case, a mutagen is used to generate a few thousand random mutations in the genome <lb/>by physical (radiation; (Muller 1927)), chemical (EMS; (Lewis and Bacher 1968)) or biological <lb/>(transposons; (McClintock 1950)) agents followed by a screen for the desired phenotype caused <lb/>by one of the mutations. Once a plant with the desired phenotype is isolated, the researcher <lb/>must identify the causal mutation. This is done by testing for an association between known <lb/>genetic markers and the phenotype. Such genetic linkage (assessed by co-segregation) indicates <lb/>that the causal mutation is located in the vicinity of the genetic marker. The introduction of next-<lb/>generation sequencing (NGS) for mapping purposes has proven to be very promising, as it is <lb/>possible to quickly identify a small number of potential causal SNPs. However, the currently <lb/>available tools e.g., SNPtrack (Leshchiner et al. 2012), SHOREmap (Schneeberger et al. 2009) and <lb/>NGM (Austin et al. 2011) are either inoperable (SNPtrack) or require coding knowledge. We have <lb/>developed the SIMPLE tool (SImple Mapping PipeLinE), which operates on the input of the NGS <lb/>fastq files generated from WT and mutant bulked DNA pools, and produces tables and a plot <lb/>showing the most likely candidate genes and locations, respectively. The tool can be easily <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>downloaded and executed with no prior bioinformatics knowledge and requires only a few simple <lb/>preparatory steps to initiate. Once the program runs, the user accesses a table with the most <lb/>likely candidate genes and a figure file that marks the location(s) of these candidates. Our <lb/>pipeline has several advantages in comparison to other mapping tools. First, the entire process <lb/>is user-friendly. It does not require any prior programming knowledge or NGS analysis skills. <lb/>Second, it is &quot;all-inclusive&quot;; besides a few initial steps such as downloading the fastq files to the <lb/>right folder and naming them, the user only needs to paste three lines into the terminal <lb/>application to run the program. These steps are described in the README file. Third, the program <lb/>can accept as input any paired-end or single-end fastq combination from the WT and mutant <lb/>bulks. Fourth, this tool accepts, based on our experience, several types of segregating <lb/>populations such as M2, M3, back-cross and map-cross. The project is currently hosted on GitHub <lb/>and is available for download at https://github.com/wacguy/Simple. <lb/>Results <lb/>The concept behind the mapping tool <lb/>All methods that aim to map a causal DNA change implement a similar strategy. For bulk-<lb/>segregant analysis, a segregating F2 population is divided into mutant phenotype and WT <lb/>phenotype. DNA from each of the two bulked samples is sequenced by next-generation <lb/>sequencing. For recessive mutations, the basic principle is to find the DNA changes that have only <lb/>non-reference reads (i.e., locations that differ from the reference genome) in the mutant bulk <lb/>and ~1:2 mutant to WT ratio of reads in the WT bulk (since the WT bulk is comprised of +/-and <lb/>+/+ individuals in a 2:1 ratio). For dominant mutations, the concept is similar, but the non-<lb/></body>

			<body>segregating (with a reference linked locus) bulk would be the WT batch (+/+) whereas the mutant <lb/>bulk is comprised of mixed genotypes of mutant individuals (+/-and -/-). Our pipeline is based <lb/>on a short BASH script that calls BWA (Li and Durbin 2009), Samtools (Li et al. 2009), Picard <lb/>(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard), GATK (McKenna et al. 2010; DePristo et al. 2011; Van <lb/>der Auwera et al. 2013), SnpEff (Cingolani et al. 2012) and R (R Core Team 2013) in order to <lb/>generate two VCFs (variant call files) and a plot. The first VCF lists all candidate genes and the <lb/>second one contains the entire SNP population found by the GATK HaplotypCaller tool. <lb/>Generation of the candidate list is based on several criteria. First, and most importantly, the <lb/>mutation has to segregate in the correct ratio. Additionally, we chose to focus on SNPs that are <lb/>consistent with a specific set of criteria to identify the most likely causal mutation. However, <lb/>these criteria can be readily changed by manipulating the simple.sh file. For example, we select <lb/>only single nucleotide changes, since single nucleotide mutagens such as EMS are commonly <lb/>used. We also select for mutations that have a significant effect on the protein rather than <lb/>synonymous mutations or changes in intergenic regions. Figure 1a shows a flowchart of the <lb/>pipeline concept. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1. The SIMPLE pipeline workflow <lb/>User-required actions are in yellow and SIMPLE actions are in blue. The specific program that executes the action(s) <lb/>of SIMPLE is indicated at the bottom of each blue box. <lb/>To test our pipeline, we sequenced ten populations that were generated in three independent <lb/>EMS screens. We used four different population types including M2 (a segregating population <lb/>generated by selfing a heterozygous plant from a mutagenized population), M3 (a segregating <lb/>population generated by selfing a heterozygous M2 plant), back-cross (an F2 segregating <lb/>population generated by crossing a mutant plant with the original parental line) and map-cross <lb/>(an F2 segregating population generated by crossing a mutant plant with another accession, e.g., <lb/>L. erecta). Some of the mutants were sequenced more than once or in successive generations, if <lb/>they had more than one mapping population or if initial mapping failed (see Table 1 for details). <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Table 1. Mapping populations that were used to test the SIMPLE pipeline <lb/>Column 1 denotes the line number. Line 300-4 was generated by selfing a heterozygous plant from line 300. <lb/>1 Each <lb/>color represent a different EMS mutagenizing experiment; <lb/>2 asterisk indicates a stop codon; <lb/>3 see methods for more <lb/>information. <lb/>The pipeline produces three files, cands4.txt, plot4.txt and Rplot.pdf (see details below) to help <lb/>identify the causal mutation. In most cases, the candidate list output file (cands4.txt files) <lb/>together with the position to SNP-ratio plot were sufficient to identify the causal mutation (Fig. <lb/>2a). In line 194 no genes were found in the candidate list, most likely due to an erroneous <lb/>inclusion of WT seedlings in the mutant bulk. Nevertheless, the program provides additional <lb/>information to help identify strong candidates. For example, the plot indicates a linked locus near <lb/>the center of chromosome 3 (Fig. 2b). Browsing the SNP population in this region identifies a <lb/>premature stop codon in RHD3 (AT3G13870). Indeed, this line has a short root and wavy root <lb/>hair phenotype similar to the mapped M2-300/M3-300-4 line and to rhd3-1 (Wang et al. 1997; <lb/>2015). <lb/>There are two parameters that appear to strongly influence the success of the pipeline in <lb/>identifying the causal mutation or at least a short list of potential SNPs. First, incorrect inclusion <lb/>of WT plants in the mutant bulk leads to reference reads in the mutant fastq file. As a result, the <lb/>causal SNP and linked mutations are viewed as heterozygous. Therefore, it is essential that all <lb/>individuals in the mutant bulk be correctly phenotyped as mutant. In cases where the phenotype <lb/>is difficult to recognize, for example, as often happens with QTLs, it is recommended to work with <lb/>line 1 <lb/>generation <lb/>mapped gene <lb/>At_num <lb/>mut/wt <lb/>seedlings <lb/>CDS <lb/>changes <lb/>protein <lb/>change 2 <lb/>number of reads <lb/>(mut.ref/mut.alt <lb/>; wt.ref/wt.alt) <lb/>mean <lb/>coverage <lb/>(mut/wt) <lb/>validation 3 <lb/>remarks <lb/>474-3 <lb/>M3 <lb/>SHR <lb/>AT4G37650 23/23 <lb/>664C&gt;T <lb/>Arg222* <lb/>0/43;38/22 <lb/>73/75 <lb/>allelic test &amp; similar phenotype to known allele <lb/>300 <lb/>M2 <lb/>19/19 <lb/>1751C&gt;T <lb/>0/13;10/0 <lb/>21/25 <lb/>300-4 <lb/>M3 <lb/>50/100 <lb/>1751C&gt;T <lb/>0/64;76/42 <lb/>89/156 <lb/>300-7 <lb/>M3 <lb/>50/100 <lb/>2254C&gt;T <lb/>0/19;30/9 <lb/>23/61 <lb/>300-7 <lb/>M3 <lb/>55/50 <lb/>2254C&gt;T <lb/>1/16;110/41 <lb/>90/198 <lb/>633 <lb/>M2 <lb/>GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE 2 <lb/>AT3G54660 30/30 <lb/>790G&gt;A <lb/>Ala264Thr 1/33;38/9 <lb/>61/57 <lb/>similar phenotype to known allele (Yu et al., 2013) <lb/>couldn&apos;t be mapped with M3 population <lb/>M381 <lb/>F2-map cross on Ler <lb/>50/100 <lb/>0/21;14/0 <lb/>32/21 <lb/>wt plants from Ler parental line <lb/>B381 <lb/>F2-back-cross on Col-0; CASP1::GFP <lb/>50/100 <lb/>0/20;60/1 <lb/>31/83 <lb/>wt plants from Col-0;CASP1::GFP parental line <lb/>EMS608 M3 <lb/>BIN4 <lb/>AT5G24630 47/150 <lb/>971G&gt;A <lb/>Gly324Glu 1/20;18/1 <lb/>46/39 <lb/>similar phenotype to known allele (Breuer et al., 2007) <lb/>194 <lb/>M2 <lb/>RHD3 <lb/>AT3G13870 23/49 <lb/>1951C&gt;T <lb/>Gln651* <lb/>10/22;49/6 <lb/>23/49 <lb/>similar phenotype to known allele <lb/>MYB36 <lb/>AT5G57620 <lb/>174G&gt;A <lb/>Trp58* <lb/>complementation &amp; similar phenotype to known allele <lb/>SECA1 <lb/>RHD3 <lb/>AT3G13870 <lb/>Ser584Phe <lb/>allelic test &amp; similar phenotype to known allele <lb/>AT4G01800 <lb/>Arg752* <lb/>allelic test &amp; similar phenotype to known allele <lb/></body>

			<body>smaller but high confidence populations rather than include potentially wild-type individuals in <lb/>the mutant bulk. Alternatively, mutant plants can be tested based on the segregation of their <lb/>offspring. A second crucial parameter is sequencing depth. This is important because different <lb/>genomic regions have variable coverage depth and even when mean coverage appears to be <lb/>sufficient, some regions may still have very few reads, which renders them almost impossible to <lb/>genotype. We recommend a minimum of 30x coverage. <lb/>We recommend working with an F2/M2 generation rather than an F3/M3 generation for two <lb/>reasons. First, a segregating F3/M3 population generated from a single F2/M2 heterozygous <lb/>plant is homozygous for one quarter of the loci as well as being homozygous for the causal SNP <lb/>whereas an F2/M2 population is homozygous only for the causal mutation and the genetically <lb/>linked region. Therefore, there is substantial information loss in the F3/M3 generation and <lb/>mapping is heavily dependent on the segregation of the WT bulk. This bulk is less informative <lb/>because its 2:1 WT to mutant ratio in the binomial read-distribution has a higher potential to vary <lb/>from the expected values. In contrast, the mutant bulk is expected to have strictly no reference <lb/>reads and a few dozen alternate reads. Another reason to prefer the F2/M2 generation is that <lb/>the following generation goes through a second round of recombination that generates <lb/>chromosomes and chromosomal regions with more complex haplotypes that are more difficult <lb/>to interpret. <lb/>Input files <lb/>The user provides the fastq files that are generated by a next-generation sequencing platform <lb/>such as Illumina 2000 and places them in the fastq folder. Each bulk (mutant or WT) can have <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>either a single file in the case of single-end sequencing or two files for paired-end. All other <lb/>dependencies such as reference files and programs are either present or downloaded as part of <lb/>the pipeline, with two exceptions. The user has to provide the GATK executable due to licensing <lb/>issues; Java and R should also be pre-installed. A short description of how to run the pipeline is <lb/>provided in the short README file (Supplementary file 3). <lb/>Output files <lb/>The program generates more than 30 files, although most of them are not necessary for non-<lb/>programmers. There are three files that can help identify the causal mutation. The file Rplot.pdf <lb/>(looks similar to Figure 2a or 2b) shows the chromosomal location of each SNP, plotted against a <lb/>LOESS-fitted ratio variable. This variable was generated using this equation: <lb/>𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = <lb/>𝑤𝑡 ()* <lb/>𝑤𝑡 ()* + 𝑤𝑡 ,-. <lb/>− <lb/>𝑚𝑢𝑡 ()* <lb/>𝑚𝑢𝑡 ()* + 𝑚𝑢𝑡 ,-. <lb/>where, <lb/>𝑤𝑡 ()* is the number of reads in the WT bulk that are called with the reference genome <lb/>nucleotide, <lb/>𝑤𝑡 ,-. is the number of reads in the WT bulk that are called with a non-reference genome <lb/>nucleotide, <lb/>𝑚𝑢𝑡 ()* is the number of reads in the mutant bulk that are called with the reference genome <lb/>nucleotide <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>and, <lb/>𝑚𝑢𝑡 ,-. is the number of reads in the mutant bulk that are called with a non-reference genome <lb/>nucleotide. <lb/>The ratio should be around zero for unlinked SNPs and approximately 0.66 for the causal <lb/>mutation and genetically linked SNPs (Figure 2). We removed all SNPs with a ratio lower than 0.1 <lb/>and applied LOESS smoothing with degree=2 and span=0.3. <lb/></body>

(Supplementary file 1 <lb/>as an example). These candidates are selected based on the following criteria. 1) The SNP has to <lb/>be homozygous-alternate (namely, only reads that are different from the reference genome) in <lb/></body>

			<body>the mutant bulk and with approximately 2:1 reference to alternate read ration in the WT bulk. <lb/>Second, the SNP must be a single nucleotide change rather than an indel. Third, the mutation <lb/>should have a significant effect on the protein, i.e., splice acceptor, splice donor, start lost, stop <lb/>gained or missense variant. <lb/>The third important file is plot4.txt (Supplementary file 2 as an example). This file lists all the SNPs <lb/>with their locations, the change in the coding sequence, the effect on the protein and the number <lb/>of reads for each allele in each bulk. This file is important in case the cands4.txt did not yield any <lb/>candidate genes. For example, in some cases, the phenotype of the sampled mutants is difficult <lb/>to distinguish from WT, such as the case when mapping QTLs or mutants with subtle phenotypes. <lb/>In these scenarios, WT plants might be included in the mutant bulk and the causal SNP is <lb/>interpreted as heterozygous for both bulks. In such cases, the user can manually browse the <lb/>plot4.txt file to identify: 1) SNPs that are nearly homozygous-alternate in the mutant bulk and <lb/>approximately 2:1 reference to alternate allelic ratio in the WT bulk and 2) SNPs with a significant <lb/>effect on the coding region. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Approximately half of the Arabidopsis genes have unknown molecular functions <lb/>(http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/genome_snapshot.jsp) which creates a <lb/>large opportunity for discovering novel gene functionalities through relatively simple forward-<lb/>genetic screens. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies offers new and <lb/>rapid opportunities for identification of the genes affected by such screens. The main advantage <lb/>of genome sequencing over traditional map-based cloning methods that use molecular markers <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>such as RFLP and AFLP is that NGS provides single-nucleotide resolution. While pre-NGS methods <lb/>could identify a genomic region, this had to be further mined for potential mutation(s) in <lb/>candidate genes. By contrast, sequencing a mutagenized genome reveals the entire population <lb/>of genetic changes. The causal mutation is then precisely identified using <lb/>bioinformatics/computational tools. Another important benefit of using NGS for mapping is that <lb/>a small population (a few dozen individuals) is usually sufficient for mapping. Since the mapping <lb/>resolution is as high as a single nucleotide, the importance of each and every recombinant for <lb/>reducing the region of the causal mutation (&quot;chromosome walking&quot;) is less important. In other <lb/>words, the size of the region bounded by recombination events in which the causal mutation lies <lb/>is not important as the researcher is able to visualize each and every SNP, evaluate it, and choose <lb/>the one that has the highest likelihood of being causal. Mapping by NGS is especially fruitful when <lb/>a large mapping population can be easily generated and screened which is the case for many <lb/>plant species, nematodes and yeast. We have developed an easy to use tool that allows mapping <lb/>of single-nucleotide induced mutations, even by researchers that have very little experience with <lb/>bioinformatics tools. Our pipeline will take the fasq files as input and will identify causal SNPs <lb/>with no pre-processing steps required. The output tables and plots can be readily used to identify <lb/>the most likely mutation. Even in the case where no candidate gene is present, the list of SNPs <lb/>with their read calls number in the mutant and WT bulks and their effect, will most likely point <lb/>towards the correct gene. In theory, the SIMPLE pipeline can be used with any diploid species <lb/>that has bulked mutant and WT mapping populations. Although not many species are currently <lb/>covered, it is easy to add any species of interest to the pipeline (see README file). The program <lb/>runs on Mac OSX version 10.11.6 and Linux release 6.7 (GNOME 2.28.2) with Java 1.7 installed <lb/></body>
