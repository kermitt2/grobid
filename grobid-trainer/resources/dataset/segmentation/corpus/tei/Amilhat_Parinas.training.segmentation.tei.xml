			The impact of growing trans-mountain mobilities : first conclusions of a <lb/>comparative Alpine / Andean research <lb/> ABSTRACT <lb/> Traffic flows have little in common in the Western Alps and the tropical Central Andes, <lb/>However the rhythm of circulation increase, the stress produced by the recent construction of <lb/>new infrastructures (accelerated in the Andes since the 1990&apos;s), the growing concentration of <lb/>traffic justify bringing together such different worlds in a parallel analysis. Mobilities are here <lb/>considered as much more than a moving capacity. They are defined as a social relation to <lb/>movement: transportation therefore appears as only one aspect of mobility analysis. A special <lb/>emphasis is put on the link between mobilities and mountains because of a complex relation <lb/>between the existence of an old interaction (mountains are mobile worlds) and new mobility <lb/>patterns derived from the growing importance of transit traffic. Through this interaction, we <lb/>question societies&apos; adaptations to the globalised world and the sustainibility of their choices. <lb/>The paper first settles on the recent changes of mobility patterns in mountain areas, insisting <lb/>on the context of these evolutions (i.e. the opening of borders in an exchange economy <lb/>favourable to the growth of international freight traffic). After reviewing the adaptation of the <lb/>transport infrastructures offer in terms, it considers the traffic regulation frame in both the <lb/>Andean and the Alpine contexts. This crossed analysis allows us to offer an interpretation of <lb/>the mountain populations&apos; self-consciousness as perceived through the adaptation of their <lb/>mobility patterns. By evidencing their vulnerability, we also illustrate the difficulties in the <lb/>implementation of sustainable principles in contexts where they have not been re-<lb/>appropriated. <lb/>

			<body> Introduction <lb/> This paper assesses the results of a comparative study on the impact of growing mobilities in <lb/>mountain regions, the latter being considered as original, as well as fragile, social and natural <lb/>environments. If considered on a quantitative basis, the traffic flows have little in common in <lb/>the Western Alps and the tropical Central Andes, our two study areas. However the stress <lb/>produced by the recent construction of new infrastructures and the rhythm of circulation <lb/>increase justify bringing together such different worlds in a parallel analysis. Knowing that <lb/>mountains have long been very mobile universes, characterized indeed by a multiscalar <lb/> movement tradition of their populations, the idea of our research project was to see if this <lb/>characteristic mobility pattern could be updated and adapted to the globalised world in which <lb/>mountain areas are now inserted. On one hand, the Alps, standing in the heart of Europe, <lb/>constituted our reference, defined as mountains to be crossed to link the dense markets of the <lb/>European Union. On the other hand, the southern altiplano Andes represented a loosely <lb/>occupied area, recently under the pressure of its insertion into the MERCOSUR and through <lb/>which a number of new roads are being launched: classically considered as mountains to be <lb/>travelled through, how would they react to such abrupt changes ? The paper first presents the <lb/>important changes in circulation patterns in the respective studied mountain areas. It then <lb/>discusses the weight of the political and historical context in the understanding of the two <lb/>environmental conservation contexts. The demonstration emphasizes the link between social <lb/>and natural systems, sine qua non condition to the implementation of a realistic protection <lb/>frame for the mountains of the Southern hemisphere. <lb/> Is crossing mountains so much easier today ? The recent evolution of <lb/>trans-mountain infrastructures and mobility patterns. <lb/> Traditional mobility patterns <lb/>

			Although commonly perceived as closed, hermetic worlds, mountains can interestingly be <lb/>characterized by the mobility processes that they host. This is true in terms of physical <lb/>environments (due to the multiple gravity effects, especially erosion) as well as in terms of <lb/>social organisations. It was put in evidence long ago that the indigenous populations of the <lb/>Andes organized themselves in order to ensure each community an access to the natural <lb/>resources offered at different heights, in varied ecosystems or so-called &quot; ecological floors &quot; <lb/>(Murra 1975; Murra 1985; Murra 1992; Troll 1931). This specific territorial pattern was <lb/>defined as the &quot; archipelagic &quot; model; its originality was based on the simultaneous control of <lb/>discontinuous portions of space which are dispersed at various heights and exposed to <lb/>different expositions. <lb/>This model has revealed a very powerful tool of interpretation of mountain environments <lb/>from a double point of view. On one hand, it has since been shown that the archipelagic <lb/>complementarity is a common characteristic of mountain areas worldwide (Bourliaud et al. <lb/>1990; Fontaine 1993), and on the other, globalisation has generally imposed a reticular <lb/>approach of territoriality. The research programme on which this article is based aimed to <lb/>update these two proposals. We sought to show how, through renewed uses of the <lb/>archipelagic figure, the understanding of mountain spaces could be useful in a much broader <lb/>geography of territories and networks. This objective could only be completed through the <lb/>elaboration of a pertinent comparative methodology. Our main object of investigation was <lb/>thus defined as the evolution of the mobility behaviours in mountain zones. <lb/>What we mean by spatial mobility is more than a moving capacity, but &quot; a vast set of practices, <lb/>knowledges and techniques which aim at reducing the distance friction which characterises all <lb/>human activities &quot; (Torricelli 2003). Mobility is thus considered in its full social spectrum, <lb/>product of the interaction between social and individual strategies, as a &quot; social relation to the <lb/>changing of place &quot; (Lévy 2000). Transportation therefore appears as only one aspect of <lb/>mobility studies, to be analysed conjointly with development models, technological contexts <lb/>and political environments. Thus, if mobilities depend on the existing transport system in the <lb/>studied areas, they cannot be understood without a more global approach. In the same way, <lb/>their impact needs to be estimated in a quite extensive way, through a social as well as <lb/>environmental analysis. <lb/> As far as mountain environments are concerned, the issues raised by the notion of mobility <lb/>appear to be very fertile indeed. First of all the assessment of old mobility patterns allow long-<lb/>term comparisons and tendency studies. Then it appears that mountain mobilities can be <lb/>divided into two sub-entities which interact through various processes. This scientific object <lb/>can be sub-divided, distinguishing between intra-massif movements (Cortès 2000; Cortès <lb/>2002; Juge 2003), and transit crossing (or so-called &quot; trans-mountain &quot; ) mobilities. The first <lb/>can be mainly understood as the local population&apos;s movement capacity, the second is often <lb/>defined as a phenomenon imposed on the mountain inhabitants by external actors. In our <lb/>Westernly centred (mainly built on the Alpine experience) vision, transit traffic is denounced <lb/>on the basis that the crossed mountain territories suffer more than they benefit from it. In the <lb/>Andes however, the recent evolutions reveal a more complex inter-relation between local and <lb/>long-scale mobilities (Juge 2003) which we will develop here. <lb/> Recent trends and growing impact of international traffic <lb/> As we have suggested, mobility patterns are very linked to the socio-environmental context. <lb/>Needless to insist on the fact that the process of globalisation of our economies and its <lb/>consequent boom of commercial exchanges, information circulation and people&apos;s movements <lb/>has profoundly transformed the problem . The volume of exchanged goods has increased <lb/>noticeably, inducing larger distance freight transportation. In 2003 for example, 103,9 <lb/>millions of tons of freight have crossed the Alps along the Mont-Cenis/Fréjus – Brenner <lb/>itinerary (by road and rail), representing twice as much as the 1980 figure (50,700,000 t). <lb/>Swiss analysts reveal that this evolution is sustained by the growth of long distance, trans-<lb/>boundary traffics, based on importation and exportation flows, underlining that transit <lb/>circulation is bound to follow its rapid progression in the years to come. The ARE (2004) has <lb/>elaborated three scenarios covering the 2002-2030 period: if the actual growth rhythm <lb/>persists, the freight traffic will grow of 54%; loosening the pressure to reduce the transit <lb/>flows, the latter would grow even faster (+78%) whereas a more constraining policy could <lb/>allow a significant change (+32% only accompanied by a concentration of traffic on the rail <lb/>rather than on the road). However, these figures are totally linked to the exchange volumes, <lb/>the latter depending on commercial growth (regional annual growth of 3,6% in 1980-2000) <lb/>and there are signs of a slow decrease in the period to come. The transportation policies <lb/>aiming at reducing road traffic in the Alps, especially on Swiss territory 1 , could contribute to <lb/>an inversion of tendencies (cf. Löshberg 2008, St Gothard 2012, Brenner, Lyon-Turin railway <lb/>projects). <lb/>In the central Andes, the rhythm of growth can be compared, although quantities have little in <lb/>common, for various reasons which we will explain. On the Arica-La Paz road, the traffic <lb/>from Chile to Bolivia was estimated to 200 000 tons/year in the beginning of the 1990&apos;s and <lb/>jumped to 350-380 000 tons/year when the road was asphalted in 1996, stabilising itself <lb/>around 500 000 tons/year in the beginning of the 2000&apos;s. Similarly, the modernisation of the <lb/>Jama pass between Chile Argentina induced a progression from less than 20 000 tons/ year in <lb/>the early 90&apos;s to 50-60 000 tons/year when the improvement work started in 1995-96 and up <lb/>to 95 000 tons in 2003. This evolution is not only due to the improvement of the roads quality, <lb/>as revealed by the traffic measured at the Colchane customs house, on a dirt road (very <lb/>partially asphalted) uphill from the big duty free zone of Iquique. At this point, the <lb/>exportations have grown exponentially: from some tens of thousand of tons in the beginning <lb/>of the 1990&apos;s they reached 50 000 t in 1993, 90 000 t in 1995-96, 112 000 t in 1998, and, after <lb/>a sheer drop, fell down to 60 000 t in 2003. In the Andes, the main projects concern road <lb/>

			infrastructures, the railway interconnexions being left to private initiative, are only partly <lb/>maintained (Blanc 2004). <lb/>Along with freight traffic, touristic frequentation has increased inducing another type of long <lb/>distance passenger circulation. More than ever, it is thought that the structural barrier effect <lb/>traditionally attributed to mountains can be fought and won. 2 However, a retrospective <lb/>outlook allows to qualify this assertion. Although topographic and climatic factors have <lb/>always made mountain circulations somehow perilous, the history of the Alps teaches us how <lb/>the existence of politically and economically linked populations in Central, Mediterranean <lb/>and Western Europe have driven to the building and maintenance of altitude paths, roads and <lb/>railways (Torricelli 2002). Whenever markets needed to be put into relation, commercial <lb/>itineraries have crossed the mountains. The situation is quite different in the Andes: their <lb/>Pacific piedmont concentrate the population since the colonial conquest, with no comparable <lb/>densities on the eastern slopes, especially at the Amazonian latitudes. However, the <lb/>demographic heart of the South American continent is located far away from the Cordillera, <lb/> on the Atlantic coast. In the mountain regions, the old commercial routes have traditionally <lb/>linked regional cost-mountain-forest exchanges and larger distance altiplanic circulations. The <lb/>Spanish colonisation, followed by the insertion of the nineteenth century-born independent <lb/>republics in the liberal economy have superimposed extraction flows towards the maritime <lb/>façades. What withstands from this rapid presentation is that, up to now, although regional <lb/>links have been very strong up to the past century (Benedetti 2003); Conti 1994; Conti 2000a; <lb/>Conti 2000b; Conti &amp; Lagos 2002; González Pizarro 2000) no necessary long distance <lb/>commercial relations existed through out these mountains. <lb/>The past decade has witnessed the realisation of a number of new infrastructures in the <lb/>Central Andes, inducing some interrogations on the evolution of trans-Andean mobilities: has <lb/>the globalised context been favourable to the emergence of new markets? Is this a <lb/>consequence of the continental integration dynamics (MERCOSUR). This is certainly what is <lb/>announced locally, by regional, national and continental stake-holders. All our field work has <lb/>revealed opposite conclusions: in this case, it is hoped that new roads will induce commercial <lb/>traffic and be propitious to the constitution of new markets. This quest for development <lb/>through economical growth is essential in marginalised mountain regions. The impact of the <lb/>new roads is therefore always presented through this prism, avoiding quasi-systematically the <lb/>sustainability issues which arise. <lb/>Cultural and commercial contexts are different, so are current transport policies… so why <lb/>thrive to compare Alpine and Andean mobility patterns? Because it seems that they offer two <lb/>types of answers to a comparable stress, that of the growth of transit traffic in fragile <lb/>mountain environments. The parallel analysis of the two situations, far from concluding on <lb/>the necessity to transfer occidental models in other continents, enlightens some of the <lb/>contradictions of our conservation policies. <lb/> Comparative methodology: beyond figures, discourse analysis and morphologic <lb/>approaches <lb/> The article is based on a collective project, which has lead young investigators from Alpine <lb/>and Andean countries to work together over the past three years. The field work has led to <lb/>cooperation between geographers, core of the team, with historians, archaeologists and <lb/> 
			
			<note place="footnote">2 <lb/> Long distance transit movements are not the only type of mobilities that can be considered as characteristic of <lb/>our globalised world. It can also be assumed that at a regional scale, mobilities have also been affected. What is <lb/>at stake is no longer the acceleration of the rural exodus towards the aspect cities, which used to generate <lb/>temporary or definitive migrations from the rural settlements to the regional or national capitals. A reverse <lb/>movement is now occurring, due to the expansion and changing morphology of urban entities: especially in <lb/>metropolitan or metropolised areas, pendular movements are increasing, notably affecting the Alpine peri-urban <lb/>spaces.

			economists. As far as first conclusions can be drawn, a diachronic approach appears <lb/>fundamental in this field. <lb/>The innovation consists in avoiding to apply European-centred conclusions to the South <lb/>American realities or vice-versa. One other important methodological aspect of this project <lb/>consisted in &quot; exchanging &quot; field applications and questioning mountain socio-environmental <lb/>relations with an international eye. The Alpine specialists were sent to study Andean terrains <lb/>and vice-versa, hoping to instigate some sort of the neophyte&apos;s curiosity into the specialist&apos;s <lb/>analysis. This crossing of experiences has proved very fertile indeed, allowing to set up a <lb/>debate on the cultural references of planning policies. The central place of the sustainable <lb/>development debate in the Alps was thus questioned by its absence from the Andean scene. <lb/>The terms of a comparative research are based on a qualitative methodology since the key <lb/>figures are very disproportionate. The number of vehicles which crosses annually the recently <lb/>asphalted Jama pass (at the border between Chile and Argentina), which varies annually <lb/>between 15 000 and 2000, corresponds to a figure that corresponds to a few days traffic <lb/>through Chamonix Mont-Blanc tunnel (3,000 trucks and 2,000 light vehicles daily) or through <lb/>the Fréjus one (3,000 daily and 2,000 light vehicles). The investigation was thus centred on <lb/>qualitative investigation, as well as on the establishment of a good mapping of the transport <lb/>system related to our study zones, inexistent in the Andean zone. The used data consisted <lb/>mainly in semi-directive interviews archives, local leaflets, press and media analysis. Even the <lb/>elaboration of a regional mapping of the transport system in the central Andes was based on <lb/>this approach, since the required information is very dispersed between public and private <lb/>sources and the statistic series not always corroborating. <lb/>Our approach of mobility systems is built on the confrontation of different stakeholders <lb/>discourses and representation, mainly expert-based vs. inhabitants&apos; representations. This <lb/>opposition has been put in evidence in the Andes as well as in the Alps. Interestingly, <lb/>mobility practices are connected to the integration of an international border in the different <lb/>stakeholders territorialities. <lb/> Results: comparable mobility systems, diverging transportation policies <lb/>and infrastructure realisations <lb/> Morphologic proximities <lb/> In spite of all the differences between the Alpine and Andean contexts that we have pointed <lb/>out, the analysis of the mobility networks in both massifs reveal morphologic homologies. <lb/>First of all, the globalisation of the economies seems to have induced a strong concentration <lb/>of flows along a selected number of trunk roads. This is very notable in the Alps where the <lb/>network is very diversified and branched out. The contemporary conditions of <lb/>competitiveness ( &quot; just-in time &quot; industrial and commercial supplying) impose regular inflows <lb/>into polarised activity centres. The latter need to be linked efficiently and directly, with no or <lb/>scarce preoccupation for the intermediate spaces. The combination of flows concentration and <lb/>exchange growth has led to an unprecedented selection of traffic itineraries. This tendency has <lb/>a very worrying environmental consequence, since it provokes the concentration of <lb/>contaminating emissions in a few Alpine valleys where the environmental situation has <lb/>rapidly deteriorated. <lb/> Figure 1: Evolution of infrastructure interconnections between Chile&apos;s Norte Grande and its Andean <lb/>hinterland <lb/> This situation brings the Alpine situation closer to the Andean one: in south American <lb/>mountains, the communication network is far from being as tightly woven as in Europe <lb/>(fig.1). It is somehow difficult to speak of &quot; interconnected &quot; infrastructures in some cases. <lb/>Most of the modern roads and railways have been opened to serve the draining of the natural <lb/>resources which were exploited in this region, among which nitrates, copper and other mining <lb/>products. This explains the primary &quot; backbone &quot; organisation of the infrastructures. Most of <lb/>the local sections have been linked together as they were also partially united to the national <lb/>network (through the Panamerican Highway for example, but there is no corresponding train <lb/>line). The number of new roads has been increasing at a steady rhythm in the past decade, but <lb/>always according to similar logics, that of an extraction-based economy. The recently opened <lb/>mining projects being located in high altitude (Doña Inès de Collahuasi is above 4,000 m), the <lb/>companies which run them have been faced with the necessity of opening quality altitude <lb/>infrastructures to ensure the exportation of their production. In most cases, the public <lb/>authorisation is given to the company to build the road on its own budget, but the Chilean <lb/>government binds to finance the maintenance. Interestingly enough, public documents foresee <lb/>the possibility to connect these new roads with the main itineraries (cf. the option of joining <lb/>the Escondida mine&apos;s road to the Jama pass complex, figure n°2). <lb/> Figure 2 Joining projects : <lb/> (http://www.iirsa.org) <lb/> The possible connection of the <lb/>Escondida mine road to the Jama Itinerary <lb/>(Capricorn Tropic &quot; corridor &quot; ) <lb/> The traffic concentration implies important atmosphere degradation (noise and air quality) <lb/>along the new infrastructures. In the localities which cross these main itineraries, the situation <lb/>can also degrade itself rapidly. Initially, as shows the Andean contemporary reality, local <lb/>communities do not denounce the projects but, on the contrary, welcome the change which <lb/>the new road is supposed to bring them. In remote areas where there used to be no good links <lb/>to the main cities, transit means connectivity. The flows of goods and passengers which are <lb/>announced are expected to stop in the villages and therefore to benefit a local service offer <lb/>(small restaurants and garages, etc.). The touristic Chilean village of San Pedro de Atacama <lb/>has not done anything to claim for a diversion to make sure that the traffic generated by the <lb/>recently opened Jama pass road outskirts the picturesque historical centre. On the Argentinean <lb/>slope of the same pass, Susques has proclaimed itself &quot; gateway to the Andes &quot; … The village <lb/>pretends to transform itself into a service centre, but at present, the most significant <lb/>progression is that of prostitution (Benedetti &amp; Argarañaz 2003). Although this configuration <lb/>may seem very naïve, it must be said that if the perception of the situation is gradually <lb/>changing in the Alps, the most significant difference in the mobility patterns is the importance <lb/>of the railway network. <lb/> L.

			Figure 3: Central Andean networks updated <lb/> Network complementarities and transport regulation frameworks <lb/> The exceptionality of the Alpine model is the close interrelation between two transportation <lb/>modalities: although rail and road are often presented as antagonistic, the efficiency of the <lb/>European Alpine system is based on this multimodal resource (Martin &amp; Chateau 2000). The <lb/>Andean situation is quite different: a number of railways have been built in the turn of the <lb/>nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but the company-owned lines present technical and <lb/>financial interconnection problems (they were designed without this preoccupation). There is <lb/>a wide range of gauges, but the most represented is the meter one. The main obstacle to the <lb/>functioning of a continental network is more complex: most of the Bolivian lines work on the <lb/>same gauge and could facilitate the junction of the different itineraries which connect with the <lb/>Pacific harbours. Their exploitation is now under private concession. The privatisation was <lb/>organised respecting the regionally organised pre-existing networks. The Arica-La Paz line <lb/>(opened in 1913) has been sold in two distinct shares. The Chilean portion has been acquired <lb/>by a Bolivian company 3 whereas the Bolivian segment is controlled by Chilean capital 4 . This <lb/>line undergoes big difficulties due to the competition with a newly asphalted road (1996), <lb/>partial destructions due to bad weather (2001) and to the strategy of the Chilean Luksic group. <lb/>His interest is to operate traffic through the lines he owns, with a tendency to divert the traffic <lb/>between Bolivia and Chile (including the freight originated in or directed to La Paz) to the <lb/>Chilean harbours ofAntofagasta and Mejillones harbours (which he also partly controls). With <lb/>a network organisation dispersed between so many private and public stakeholders, it is very <lb/>difficult to initiate a regional policy aiming at a sectorial regulation effort. Where the State <lb/>strongly disengages from the railway system, the question of the identification of a superior <lb/>authority that could guarantee the territorial coherence of transportation networks surges . <lb/>In spite of some fundamental differences, the public debate often seems to turn around the <lb/>same issues in the Andes and in the Alps: international cooperation, integration processes, <lb/>network interconnection are presented as the key words. An analysis of public discourse must <lb/>thus ensure that it underlines the respective positioning of the various parties, an element as <lb/>essential to the global comprehension of the problem as the contents of the message itself. In <lb/>the Alps, the effort is being put on international cooperation in order to complete national <lb/>regulation and, in some cases, to overcome what local or national authorities impede. The <lb/>difficulties in the application of the Alpine Convention road transport dispositions illustrate <lb/>the complexity of this process. The political debate on the Lyon-Turin line in France is <lb/>another illustration of these obstacles. When the tools of a more global policy are being <lb/>discussed in the Alps, working on the improvement of rail traffic for freight, the political <lb/>context is not as favourable as it seems in the Andes. <lb/>The central Andes are marginal to the MERCOSUR construction, since Bolivia, Chile and <lb/>Peru are only associated members of the great market, Argentina being the latter&apos;s only <lb/>foundation member. However, there is a strong will to develop an international, or better said <lb/> &quot; inter-regional &quot; process of integration. Most of the mountain regions of the concerned area <lb/>resent the marginalised position in which the centralised States to which they belong has <lb/>maintained them, even when an official decentralisation process in operating or in the case of <lb/>the federal Republic of Argentina. They wish to found an alliance of peripheries, built on the <lb/>conviction that unity will help them fight their common handicap. In a way, this process <lb/>opens a vast effort of requalification of mountain areas, especially in Chile and Argentina, <lb/>countries where the national territory turned its back on the Andes, forgetting their central <lb/>

			status in the precolombian period These provinces have been taking contacts and establishing <lb/>the basis for collaboration over the past twenty years: the initiative was first taken by people <lb/>thriving to develop international business at a regional scale (multiplication of international <lb/>fairs) and was then relayed by the regional governments (representing their respective <lb/>national politics and sometimes taking a step ahead) before being supported by international <lb/>organisations such as the IIRSA, Iniciativa para la Integración Regional de Sur América. <lb/> This allows constructive contacts even between territories belonging to countries that do not <lb/>share diplomatic relations such as Bolivia and Chile . The related provinces have self-<lb/>proclaimed themselves ZICOSUR, Zona de Integración del Centro del Cono Sur but the <lb/>difficulties in the implementation of their initiative questions the necessary status of the State <lb/>in continental integration processes. <lb/>We tried to measure the impact of these joint political efforts on mobility patterns. The <lb/>conclusions are far from being homogeneous. The desire for integration has certainly <lb/>influenced the funding of new infrastructures, but only road trunks . The rail system cannot be <lb/>integrated to this common effort, due to the global privatisation of the networks and to the <lb/>importance of the needed investments to build some missing junctions which could ensure a <lb/>better connectivity at the continental scale. The balance of the ultimate decade is thus an <lb/>improvement of the transit capacity in the central Andes (new roads, gaz pipelines and high <lb/>tension electric lines) but a much slower evolution of the mobility patterns. <lb/>We clearly face an opposite evolution. In the Alps, we probably testimony the beginning of a <lb/>diminution in the transit rhythm of progression, due to a very active political will to face the <lb/>environmental impact of such mobility. On the contrary, in the Andes, we face a claim for <lb/>traffic growth perceived as the vector of economic development, regardless of the <lb/>environmental and social impact of trans-mountain transit. In the second case, it seems <lb/>essential to the regional populations to attract flows towards themselves to prove their <lb/>existence whereas in the first one it was vital to reject them to live… But exist as what, as a <lb/>community with a claimed mountain identity, an ethnic basis, a regional identification, a <lb/>common sense of economic development, a territorial project ? <lb/>

			Mobility argumentation and practises: the status of traditional mountain <lb/>populations <lb/> The presentation of the networks and the updating of knowledge on the Andean area was a <lb/>necessary step in the process of understanding the mobility patterns in the Alps and the <lb/>Andes. These appear as preliminary elements in the study of territorial practises. What does <lb/>mobility represent today in the life of mountain inhabitants ? Is its importance due to intense <lb/>movements throughout the massifs or to the opinion and arguments that these people develop <lb/>around the mobility issues? In other terms, how do local movements articulate themselves <lb/>with transit circulations and how do they interact with one another ? <lb/> Field work has put into evidence that the more mobile are not no longer those whose <lb/>culture used to integrate the movement tradition that we described above. It is <lb/>paradoxally demonstrated that the opening of an international border does not imply <lb/>an immediate growth of crossing movement: on the contrary the populations living <lb/>close-by often reduce their trans-boundary movements. Every thing occurs as if <lb/>depriving this practise of its norm transgression aspect takes a good part of its <lb/>meaning away. This does not mean that the populations who live in altitude have <lb/>forgotten these &quot; patrimonial &quot; practises. Some of them invert in this heritage to ensure <lb/>their economic survival in the piedmont cities. L. Juge (2004) has shown that some of <lb/>the tradesmen who take in charge the consumption goods imports from the duty free <lb/> zone of Iquique into Bolivia (Oruro, Cochabamba) belong to families whose roots are <lb/>communities originally located around the boundary line : the historical know-how <lb/>accumulated through centuries of lama caravans traffic has been reinvested in truck <lb/>driving on the new international roads. However this is no longer the main activity of <lb/>the community members. <lb/> Those who live closer to the border, within the mountain zone, are not necessarily those who <lb/>are the most mobile although some of them use the old schemes in the new transit schemes. <lb/>The investigation reveals that experts and dominant stakeholders as well as inhabitants, talk a <lb/>lot about mobility and transboundary crossing. Town dwellers (among whom emerge the <lb/>political and economical regional elites) have on the contrary appropriated <lb/>themselves this aspect of mountain patrimony. Their discourse not only integrates <lb/>mobility and trans-mountain crossing but gives a central place to these arguments, <lb/>as if they were able to substantiate their territorial basis. The latter do not need to <lb/>experiment personally the mobility practises to make a political instrument out of <lb/>them. Their instrumentation of mobility is transformed into a territorial argumentation, <lb/>susceptible to enable them to extend their power over the mountain hinterland which <lb/>they are mostly ignorant of. The present day mobility patterns bring together those <lb/>who practise movement and those who instrumentalise it. <lb/> This paradox illustrates the difficulty to integrate the cultural patrimony of the ancient <lb/>mountain groups into the contemporary territorial projects which are designed to sustain the <lb/>development of mountain zones. It also puts into light another incoherence of the <lb/>contemporary planning orientations dictated by the international organisation. Aiming at the <lb/>reducing inequalities, they have induced a global effort to finance the &quot; accessibility &quot; of <lb/>remote territories. This has been raised as a dogma which power reveals in the Andean case. <lb/>The idea is not only to allow all population a capacity of movement (which in this case they <lb/>already managed) but to ensure the growth of markets by the extension of the goods <lb/>circulation perimeter. Sustainable development appears in a very second position, as a <lb/>corrective value rather than as a prior principle. Since the same international organisations <lb/>often fund both orientations, new projects usually contain a good degree of contradiction in <lb/>their meaning. On the field in less developed countries, it often appears that the impact studies <lb/>are seldom carried out by neutral experts and that development overtakes sustainability. <lb/> Conclusion : is conservation possible in politically vulnerable <lb/>environments ? <lb/> In a certain way, the sustainability discourse and the conservation measures it <lb/>recommends could be interpreted through the prism we were able to put into light <lb/>through this study of mobility patterns. Stakeholders who pretend to extend their <lb/>influence on the mountain areas may be using sustainability as a form of <lb/>territorialisation. Local populations who would be the first to benefit the environmental <lb/>bettering take a lot more time to react favourably to environmentally friendly <lb/>predictions. This often surprises the observer who often arrives with a pre-<lb/>established conception of the original mountain population&apos;s tradition of living in <lb/>cultural and environmental harmony with their universe. In the Andes, the indigenous <lb/>habitants still offer a symbolic part of their meal to the Pacha Mama (Mother Earth), <lb/>but they do no longer rely on ecological mobilities for a living; those who survive are <lb/> the ones who have managed to catch on the globalisation process, sometimes by <lb/>selling lamas to buy a truck. In other words, the sustainable development seems to <lb/>be valid only in two types of mountain contexts. It concerns on one hand the remote <lb/>areas where the culture equilibrium has not been damaged and where the traditional <lb/>lifestyles are in harmony with nature and do not question the ecosystem <lb/>reproduction. And on the second hand it can be applied to mountains which are <lb/>integrated with their urban environments. There, the dominant stakeholders look out <lb/>for correctives to the globalisation process and its correlated environmental and <lb/>social damages. In the intermediary phase, recommending sustainability has little <lb/>sense, since the populations that are newly connected to the occidental way of life <lb/>first perceive its power of attraction, and often devaluation correspondingly their <lb/>traditional values. Through its review of the evolution of the transport sector in the <lb/>Andes, the article has also shown that environmental conservation requires a good <lb/>level of political regulation. Even before entering the top-down or bottom-up debate, the <lb/>public stakeholders&apos; lack of intervention means questions the possibility of a local <lb/>mobilisation around the design of a territorial project. Some conservation projects are <lb/>emerging in the Andean regions we studied, due to the effort to classify Chungara lake as an <lb/>UNESCO world patrimony area which lead to the opening of a national park which limits are <lb/>set, on the northern side, on the international Arica-La Paz road: a transborder park is under <lb/>study, incorporating Bolivian and Chilean territories. But sustainable cannot be limited to <lb/>localised conservation measures which appear as a corrective of the general tendencies <lb/>revealed by the mobility analysis. <lb/></body>
