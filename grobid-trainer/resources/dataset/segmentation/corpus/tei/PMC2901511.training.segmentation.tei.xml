The planar structures of <lb/>fijiolides A (1) and B (2) were elucidated by interpretation of 2D NMR spectroscopic data, while <lb/>the absolute configurations of these compounds were defined by interpretation of circular <lb/>dichroism (CD) and 2D NMR data combined with application of the advanced Mosher&apos;s method. <lb/>Fijiolides A and B are related to several recently isolated chloroaromatic compounds, which <lb/>appear to be the Bergman cyclization products of enediyne precursors. Fijiolide A reduced TNF-α <lb/>induced NFκB activation by 70.3%, with an IC 50 value of 0.57 µM. Fijiolide B demonstrated less <lb/>inhibition, only 46.5%, without dose-dependence. The same pattern was also observed with <lb/>quinone reductase (QR) activity: fijiolide A was found to induce quinone reductase-1 (QR1), with <lb/>an induction ratio (IR) of 3.5 at a concentration of 20 µg/mL (28.4 µM). The concentration <lb/>required to double activity (CD) was 1.8 µM. Fijiolide B did not affect QR1 activity, indicating <lb/>the importance of the nitrogen substitution pattern for biological activity. Based on these data, <lb/>fijiolide A is viewed as a promising lead for more advanced anticancer testing. <lb/></front>

			<body>Nature is an important resource for the discovery of anticancer drugs. The relevance of the <lb/>marine environment as a source of novel anticancer compounds has been validated by <lb/>discovery ca. 2,500 new metabolites with antiproliferative activity.1 Bacteria belonging to <lb/>the order Actinomycetales, commonly known as actinomycetes, have provided nearly 50% <lb/>of the bioactive microbial natural products discovered as of 2002.2 Although most microbial <lb/>small molecule discovery efforts have focused on actinomycetes from terrestrial <lb/>environments, marine-derived actinomycetes are proving to be an important resource that <lb/>has led to the discovery of biologically active molecules with unique chemical structures.3 <lb/>Excellent examples are the salinosporamides4a and marinomycins.4b Salinosporamide A, <lb/>isolated from Salinispora tropica, is a potent 20S proteasome inhibitor that recently <lb/>completed phase I clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors, lymphomas, and multiple <lb/>myeloma. The marinomycins isolated from a &quot;Marinispora&quot; sp. showed significant <lb/>antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and selective cancer cell <lb/>cytotoxicity against melanoma cell lines.4b <lb/></body>

			<body>As part of a program to explore marine bacterial metabolites as inhibitors of tumor initiation <lb/>and promotion, we have targeted nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), a transcription factor that <lb/>regulates the expression of more than 400 different genes. NFκB is an inducible, well-<lb/>characterized protein, responsible for the regulation of complex phenomena, with a pivotal <lb/>role in controlling cell signaling.5 Many genes activated by NFκB encode proteins that are <lb/>involved in tumorigenesis, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and matrix metalloproteinase <lb/>(MMP)-9, adhesion molecules, chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide <lb/>synthase (iNOS), and antiapoptosis proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl.6 Constitutive expression of <lb/>NFκB is a frequent occurrence in tumor cells, and inhibitors of NFκB have the potential of <lb/>suppressing carcinogenesis.7 Since NFκB represents an important and attractive therapeutic <lb/>target for drugs to treat many disorders, including arthritis, asthma, auto-immune diseases, <lb/>as well as different types of cancer, it has become a focal point for drug discovery from <lb/>different sources, including the marine environment. Over the last decade, several <lb/>compounds have been discovered that selectively interfere with the NFκB pathway. <lb/>Examples include phenols and polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, caffeic acid <lb/>phenethyl ester, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate), lignans, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, <lb/>and triterpenes.8 The majority of these compounds are antioxidants, which act by blocking <lb/>the protein kinase-mediated IκB degradation thereby preventing NFκB activation. <lb/>An additional strategy for protecting cells from cancer initiation involves decreasing <lb/>metabolic enzymes responsible for generating reactive species (phase I enzymes) while <lb/>increasing phase II enzymes that can deactivate radicals and electrophiles known to <lb/>intercede in normal cellular processes. Reduction of electrophilic quinones by quinone <lb/>reductase (QR) is an important detoxification pathway, and induction of this enzyme often <lb/>correlates with induction of other phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase. Based <lb/>on the evaluation of approximately 3,800 marine organism extracts, the percentage <lb/>characterized as &quot;active&quot; QR activators was established in the range of 17% of the total. <lb/>About 60 QR inducers have been isolated from a diversity of sources, and substantial <lb/>molecular diversity has been observed. These active compounds comprise ceramides, <lb/>terpenoids, withanolides, flavonoids, chalcones, alkaloids, and diarylheptanoids.8 <lb/>As part of our collaborative program to define new modulators of NFκB and QR, the <lb/>marine-derived actinomycete strain CNS-653, isolated from a marine sediment sample <lb/>collected from the Beqa Lagoon, Fiji, was evaluated. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene <lb/>sequence places this strain within the genus Nocardiopsis (GQ374440). Strain CNS-653 <lb/>shares a nearly identical (99.8%) 16S sequence with another marine-derived strain, <lb/>CNR-712 (EF392847), which produces the modified peptides lucentamycins A-D, and was <lb/>isolated from a marine sediment sample collected in the Bahamas.9 LCMS analysis of a <lb/>whole culture extract of this strain revealed peaks illustrating the characteristic MS isotopic <lb/>patterns of dichlorinated secondary metabolites ([M+H] + :[M+H+2] + :[M+H+4] + = 10:6:1). <lb/>Fractionation of a 30 L culture extract of this strain by standard silica column <lb/>chromatography, followed by reversed-phase HPLC separation, yielded fijiolides A (1, 31.0 <lb/>mg) and B (2, 3.0 mg) as colorless non-crystalline solids. Herein, we report details of the <lb/>isolation and structure elucidation of fijiolides A and B, and their effects on TNF-α induced <lb/>NFκB activity and QR induction. <lb/>The molecular formula of 1 was deduced as C 34 H 39 Cl 2 N 2 O 10 , based on analysis of <lb/>HRESIMS data (a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 705.1997 [M+H] + ) and on interpretation <lb/></body>

			<body>of 13 C NMR data. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 displayed ortho-coupled aromatic protons <lb/>[δ H 7.08 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.64 (d, J = 8.0 Hz)], meta-coupled aromatic protons [δ H 6.52 (d, J <lb/>= 2.0 Hz), 5.98 (d, J = 2.0 Hz)], three olefinic protons [δ H 6.76 (d, J = 2.1 Hz), 6.65 (dd, J = <lb/>5.3, 2.1 Hz), 6.62 (d, J = 5.3 Hz)], and three downfield methine protons [δ H 5.87 (s), 4.66 <lb/>(dd, J = 11.0, 4.0 Hz), 4.61 (ddd, J = 13.4, 13.4, 3.8 Hz)]. The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR <lb/>spectra also revealed two N-methyl groups [δ H 2.79 (δ C 44.4 and 42.9)], three methyl <lb/>singlets [δ H 1.46 (δ C 20.6), δ H 1.43 (δ C 31.5), δ H 1.70 (δ C 22.6)], and six exchangeable <lb/>protons [(4-OH, 2-NH); δ H 9.09, 8.45, 8.41, 5.86, 5.73, 4.95]. Interpretation of 2D NMR <lb/>spectoscopic data allowed three partial structures to be constructed: a <lb/>benzodihydropentalene, a 3′-chloro-5′-hydroxy-β-tyrosine, and an aminosugar unit. COSY <lb/>NMR data, including crosspeaks from H-11 (δ H 6.65, dd, J = 5.3, 2.1 Hz) to H-10 (δ H 6.62, <lb/>d, J = 5.3 Hz) and H-12 (δ H 6.76, d, J = 2.1 Hz), along with the 1D proton coupling <lb/>constants of these three protons, indicated that they belonged to a cyclopentadienyl spin <lb/>system. The presence of ortho-coupled aromatic protons [H-5 (δ H 6.64, d, J = 8.0 Hz) and <lb/>H-6 (δ H 7.08, d, J = 8.0 Hz)] indicated a 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrasubstituted benzene ring. The <lb/>connection between the cyclopentadienyl moiety and the 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrasubstituted benzene <lb/>ring was established by long-range HMBC correlations observed from H-12 (δ H 6.76) to <lb/>C-1 (δ C 148.8), C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-9 (δ C 99.8), and C-10 (δ C 135.5); from H-8 (δ H 5.87) to <lb/>C-1 (δ C 148.8), C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-6 (δ C 125.3), C-7 (δ C 147.7), C-9 (δ C 99.8), and C-10 (δ C <lb/>135.5); and from H-6 (δ H 7.08) to C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-7 (δ C 147.7), and C-8 (δ C 83.2). The <lb/>oxygenated methine proton H-13 (δ H 4.66), which was coupled to the methylene protons <lb/>H 2 -14 (δ H 4.23, and δ H 3.64), also displayed long-range HMBC correlations to carbons C-3 <lb/>(δ C 126.7), C-4 (δ C 139.3), and C-5 (δ C 129.1). These data allowed construction of the <lb/>benzodihydropentalene unit in 1 (C-1 to C-12). <lb/>The 3′-chloro-5′-hydroxy-β-tyrosine amino acid component was established by the <lb/>observation of COSY NMR crosspeaks between a downfield methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.61) <lb/>and the methylene protons H 2 -16 (δ H 2.57, and δ H 2.07)]. In addition, these assignments <lb/>were also confirmed by long-range HMBC NMR correlations from H-17 to C-15 (δ C 170.0), <lb/>C-18 (δ C 138.8), C-19 (δ C 114.2), C-23 (δ C 113.9), and C-24 (δ C 168.4), and from the <lb/>phenol proton 22-OH (δ H 8.45) to C-21 (δ C 138.3), C-22 (δ C 151.0), and C-23 (δ C 113.9). <lb/>The connection between C-8 and C-21 was established by a three-bond HMBC correlation <lb/>from H-8 (δ H 5.87) to C-21 (δ C 138.3). <lb/>The 4-deoxy-4-dimethylamino-5,5-dimethyl-ribopyranose sugar was constructed based upon <lb/>analysis of COSY and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data. COSY NMR correlations permitted <lb/>construction of the spin system from the anomeric proton H-1′ through H-4′ [H1′ (δ H 4.45, <lb/>d, J = 8.0 Hz)-H-2′ (δ H 2.92, dd, J = 8.0, 3.4 Hz)-H-3′ (δ H 4.06, d, J = 8.0, 3.4 Hz)-H-4′ <lb/>(δ H 2.98)] of the aminosugar. Long-range HMBC correlations from the N-dimethyl protons <lb/>(δ H 2.79) to C-4′ (δ C 69.6) and from the dimethyl protons (δ H 1.46, 1.43) to C-4′ (δ C 69.6), <lb/>and C-5′ (δ C 75.0) allowed placement of these protons at C-4′ and C-5′, respectively. A <lb/>long-range HMBC correlation from the anomeric proton H-1′ (δ H 4.45) to C-9 (δ C 99.8) <lb/>provided evidence for placing the sugar at C-9. The three-bond HMBC correlations from the <lb/>methylene protons H-14 (δ H 4.23, 3.64) to the carbonyl carbon C-15 (δ C 170.0) and from the <lb/>methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.61) to the carbonyl carbon C-24 (δ C 168.4) permitted the ester <lb/>linkage between C-14 and C-15, and the amide linkage between C-17 and C-24, <lb/>respectively. Lastly, placement of the chlorine at C-3 completed the structure assignment of <lb/>1. <lb/>The molecular formula of 2 was assigned as C 32 H 36 <lb/>35 Cl 2 N 2 O 9 , based upon the <lb/>pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 663.1871 [M+H] + observed in the HRESIMS spectrum. <lb/>The 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 was almost identical to that of 1 except for an up-field shifted <lb/>methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.09) and the absence of one methyl singlet. This difference <lb/></body>

			<body>indicated 2 possessed a primary amine at C-17 instead of an acetamide group. Interpretation <lb/>of 2D COSY, HSQC, and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data allowed the planar structure of 2 <lb/>to be assigned as shown. <lb/>The relative and absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by analysis of CD <lb/>spectroscopic data, application of the advanced Mosher&apos;s method, and by combined <lb/>spectroscopic methods. Fijiolides A (1) and B (2) were assigned identical absolute <lb/>configurations based upon the virtually identical CD curves observed for these two <lb/>metabolites (Figure 1). <lb/>The relative configuration of the ribopyranose ring of 1 was determined by analysis of <lb/>vicinal coupling constants and by analysis of NOESY spectroscopic data. The magnitude of <lb/>the 1 J CH coupling constant for the anomeric proton (H-1′, 162 Hz) indicated that this center <lb/>possesses a β-configuration.10 A large diaxial coupling constant (8.0 Hz) between H-1′ and <lb/>H-2′ indicated an axial configuration for H-2′, while a small vicinal coupling constant (3.4 <lb/>Hz) between H-2′ and H-3′ and strong NOESY correlations between H-2′ and H-3′ and <lb/>between H-3′ and H-4′ established that H-2′ and H-3′ are in the equatorial and axial <lb/>positions, respectively (Figure 2). Determination of the absolute configuration of the <lb/>ribopyranose of 1 was achieved using the advanced Mosher method involving NMR <lb/>analysis of MTPA ester pairs produced by derivatization with (R)-and (S)-MTPACl (α-<lb/>methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl) phenylacetyl chloride).11 Calculation of Δδ S-R values of bis-<lb/>MTPA esters (3a/b) clearly established the absolute configuration of C-2′ as R and allowed <lb/>the absolute configuration of the ribopyranose to be assigned as 1′S, 2′R, 3′R, 4′S (Figure <lb/>3a). <lb/>The absolute configurations at C-17 and C-13 in 1 and 2 were determined as S and R, <lb/>respectively, also by the application of the advanced Mosher&apos;s method. Treatment of 2 in <lb/>pyridine R-(-)-MTPA-Cl and (S)-(+)-MTPA-Cl yielded the MTPA amides 4a and 4b. <lb/>Positive Δδ S-R values for H-19 and H-23, and negative Δδ S-R values for H 2 -16 allowed the <lb/>absolute configuration of C-17 to be assigned as S (Figure 3b). To assign the absolute <lb/>configurations at C-13, the 1, 2-diol groups of the ribopyranose in 1 were first protected by <lb/>conversion to the acetonide 5 using 2,2-dimethoxypropane and pyridinium p-toluenesulfate <lb/>in methanol (Scheme 1). Treatment of 5 in pyridine with R-MTPA-Cl and S-MTPA-Cl <lb/>yielded the S-MTPA ester 6a and R-MTPA ester 6b, respectively. Calculation of Δδ S-R <lb/>values of MTPA esters of 6a/b established the absolute configuration of C-13 as R (Figure <lb/>3c). <lb/>The absolute configurations of the remaining components of 1 were determined by <lb/>interpretation of NOESY NMR correlations. A NOESY correlation between H-8 (δ H 5.87) <lb/>and the anomeric proton H-1′ (δ H 4.45) of the ribopyranose suggested a trans-orientation of <lb/>the C-9 glycoside and C-8 ether bonds.12 There were the only two possible stereoisomers, <lb/>(8R, 9R) or (8S, 9S), for fijiolides as shown in Figure 4. A NOESY correlation between <lb/>H-12 and 22-OH revealed that ester and ether linkages between the two aromatic rings of 1 <lb/>restrict free rotation of the β-tyrosine moiety in fijiolides (Figure 4a/b). The strong NOESY <lb/>correlations, between H-5 and H-13, and between H-17 and H-23, suggeste that C-8 and C-9 <lb/>could be assigned R, and R configurations, respectively (Figure 4a).13 <lb/>The chloro-cyclopenta[a]indene carbon skeleton of the fijiolides resembles that of the <lb/>cyanosporasides14a and sporolides,14b isolated from strains of the marine actinomycete <lb/>genus Salinispora (Figure 5). Both cyanosporasides A and B (7/8) and sporolides A and B <lb/>(9/10) are equally represented in the respective fermentation extracts of the producing <lb/>strains. This is what would be expected for the cycloaromatization of the enediyne <lb/>precursors to Bergman diradical intermediates followed by nonspecific quenching with <lb/></body>

			<body>hydrogen15a or chloride, a process that has been experimentally verified.15b Interestingly, <lb/>chloride addition occurred primarily at the C-3 position in fijiolides A and B. Energy <lb/>minimized modeling of fijiolides revealed that C-6 in the benzene ring is in closer proximity <lb/>to the chlorine atom of β-tyrosine than C-3 is to the 22-OH group of β-tyrosine (Figure 6). <lb/>The ribopyranose is also located near C-6 in the fijiolides, further restricting chloride <lb/>addition to that site. <lb/>With the exception of the chlorine substituents, the fijiolides are nearly identical to the <lb/>aromatization product from the bacterial metabolite C-1027 chromophore (11), derived from <lb/>an antitumor antibiotic enediyne, C-1027 (12), isolated in 1988 by Marunaka et al. from the <lb/>culture broth of Streptomyces globisporus.16 C-1027 is responsible for the activity of the <lb/>complete C-1027 natural product, which consists of an apo-protein with a single polypeptide <lb/>chain of 110 amino acid residues and a chromophore with the nine-membered enediyne and <lb/>benzoxazine moieties. In 1995, Yu et al. demonstrated that loss of the benzoxazine moiety <lb/>in the aromatization product of C-1027 resulted in a substantial decrease of DNA binding <lb/>affinity (~400 fold).17 Fijiolides A and B, which resemble the aromatization product of <lb/>C-1027 chromophore without its benzoxazine moiety, do not display significant activity <lb/>against either HCT-116 or methicillin-resistant Stapyhlococcus aureus (MRSA) (data not <lb/>shown). <lb/>NFκB plays a central role in a variety of disease states, including cancer. As a transcription <lb/>factor, activated NFκB regulates the expression of numerous genes, which subsequently <lb/>influence cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation.18 , 19 Numerous <lb/>studies demonstrating the effects of different compounds on NFκB activity have been <lb/>reported. However, the results of these studies are often inconsistent, which is likely due to <lb/>the use of diverse cell types and assay methods. For assessment of NFκB activity, we used <lb/>stably transfected 293 human embryonic kidney cells that demonstrated NFκB activation by <lb/>treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, as well as TNF-α. We observed a 5 to <lb/>15-fold NFκB activation by treatment with 0.14 nM TNF-α, high values for luciferase <lb/>luminescence, and good reproducibility.20 With this assay, fijiolide A inhibited TNF-α <lb/>induced NFκB activity by 70.3%, and dose-dependence demonstrated an IC 50 value of 0.57 <lb/>µM. Fijiolide B was less active, showing only 46.5% without a dose-dependent response. <lb/>An established mechanism of cancer chemoprevention involves the stimulation of metabolic <lb/>detoxification activity. The detoxification enzyme quinone reductase 1 (QR1) is an <lb/>important phase II enzyme (one that deactivates reactive and potentially carcinogenic <lb/>species) which converts quinones to hydroquinones, reducing oxidative cycling.21 The <lb/>enzyme exhibits broad specificity, reducing a wide range of hydrophobic quinones of <lb/>varying structure.22 The induction of QR often coincides with induction of other phase II <lb/>enzymes, and is therefore useful in the study of chemopreventive agents. Hepa 1c1c7 <lb/>(mouse hepatoma) cells were used to assess quinone reductase activity via a color change as <lb/>MTT is reduced to a blue formazan.23 Fijiolide A (1) was found to enhance QR1 activity <lb/>with an induction ratio (IR) of 3.5 at 20 µg/mL (28.4 µM). The concentration required to <lb/>double induction (CD) was 1.8 µM (The CD value of 4-bromoflavone, as a positive control, <lb/>is 0.013 µM). Fijiolide B did not demonstrate QR1 induction activity, indicating that <lb/>substitutions on the nitrogen atom affect activity. Differential activity of this type was also <lb/>observed with the NFκB assay. <lb/>QR1 is well established to undergo transcriptional activation through NFκB signaling <lb/>pathways.24 Although NFκB alone seems to account for only 20-30% of QR promoter <lb/>activity, revealed by mutational analysis, NFκB is responsible for a proportion of the <lb/>immediate response of the QR gene promoter.25 Significant inhibition of luciferase NFκB <lb/>activity and QR activation was detected with fijiolide A at reasonably low concentrations <lb/></body>

			<body>(IC 50 for NFκB, 0.57 µM; CD for QR1, 1.8 µM). It is likely that QR activation is NFκB <lb/>independent. In summary, fijiolide A modulates distinct and important mechanisms, and this <lb/>would be worthy of more detailed investigation. <lb/>General Experimental Procedures <lb/>The optical rotations were measured using a Rudolph Research Autopol III polarimeter with <lb/>a 10-cm cell. UV spectra were recorded in a Varian Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer <lb/>with a path length of 1 cm and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FTIR <lb/>spectrometer. CD spectra were collected in an AVIV model 215 CD spectrometer with a 0.5 <lb/>cm long cell. 1 H and 2D NMR spectra data were recorded at 500 or 600 MHz in DMSO-d 6 , <lb/>CDCl 3 , or methanol-d 4 solution containing Me 4 Si as internal standard on Varian Inova <lb/>spectrometers. 13 C NMR spectra were acquired at 150 MHz on a Varian Inova spectrometer. <lb/>High resolution ESI-TOF mass spectra were provided by The Scripps Research Institute, La <lb/>Jolla, CA or by the mass spectrometry facility at the Department of Chemistry and <lb/>Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA. Low resolution LC/ <lb/>MS data were measured using a Hewlett-Packard series 1100 LC/MS system with a <lb/>reversed-phase C 18 column (Phenomenex Luna, 4.6 mm × 100 mm, 5 µm) at a flow rate of <lb/>0.7 mL/min. <lb/>Collection and Phylogenetic Analysis of Strain CNS-653 <lb/>The marine-derived actinomycete, strain CNS-653, was isolated from a surf zone sediment <lb/>sample collected near Beqa Island in Beqa Lagoon in Fiji, July 2006. NCBI BLAST analysis <lb/>of the partial 16S rDNA sequence of CNQ-653 (deposited with GenBank as accession <lb/>number GQ374440) indicates that this strain is affiliated with the genus Nocardiopsis. <lb/>Cultivation and Extraction <lb/>The bacterium (strain CNS-653) was cultured in 30 2.8 L Fernbach flasks each containing 1 <lb/>L of a seawater-based medium (10 g starch, 4 g yeast extract, 2 g peptone, 1 g CaCO 3 , 40 <lb/>mg Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 •4H 2 O, 100 mg KBr) and shaken at 230 rpm at 27 °C. After seven days of <lb/>cultivation, sterilized XAD-16 resin (20 g/L) was added to adsorb the organic products, and <lb/>the culture and resin were shaken at 215 rpm for 2 h. The resin was filtered through <lb/>cheesecloth, washed with deionized water, and eluted with acetone.
