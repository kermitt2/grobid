This reaction proceeded with <lb/>high stereoselectivity, yielding mostly saponins with an α <lb/>configuration (hexoses) or predominantly with a β configuration <lb/>(pentoses). The diversity of the glycals used and the glycosides <lb/>obtained enabled a deep discussion of the Ferrier rearrangement <lb/>mechanism. The mechanism was supported by DFT calculations <lb/>concerning the intermediate ions. It was concluded that the <lb/>vinylogous anomeric effect may influence the reactivity of the <lb/>glycals. Two possible Ferrier rearrangement intermediates, <lb/>dioxolenium and allyloxycarbenium ions, were hypothesized to <lb/>exist in thermodynamic equilibrium that shifted toward the former. <lb/>The allyloxycarbenium ion participates in the final rearrangement <lb/>step and determines the reaction regioselectivity. Furthermore, the conformational stability of the 2,3-unsaturated pyranose ring <lb/>determines the stereoselectivity of the reaction. Factors influencing this stability, as well as the NMR data enabling recognition of the <lb/>0 <lb/>H 5 and 5 H 0 conformations, were identified. Chemoselective hydrogenation of 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides provided a series <lb/>of 2,3-dideoxy analogues. The anticancer, hemolytic, and antibacterial activities of the synthesized saponins are presented alongside a <lb/>discussion of the structure-activity relationships. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Diosgenin is a phytosteroidal sapogenin found in nature in the <lb/>form of glycosides. 1 Due to its impressive pharmacological <lb/>profile, 2-7 diosgenin is commonly isolated from plants. 8-13 <lb/>Methods of its synthesis have also been investigated. 14 To <lb/>enhance its pharmacological properties, diosgenin is often <lb/>chemically modified. 15-20 <lb/>Diosgenyl glycosides constitute a group of intensively <lb/>explored diosgenin derivatives. Much attention is devoted to <lb/>dioscin, a natural diosgenyl trisaccharide, 21-26 but other <lb/>glycosides of diosgenin have also been investigated. 27-31 <lb/>Among them, diosgenyl glucosaminosides are of great interest <lb/>because it was found that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-<lb/>glucopyranoside hydrochloride induces apoptosis and necrosis <lb/>in some leukemic B-cells. 32 The amino group in glucosamine <lb/>creates the possibility of chemical modifications, which is why <lb/>diosgenin is often glycosylated with this sugar. 33 <lb/>This work presents the application of the Ferrier rearrange-<lb/>ment to the synthesis of 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides. <lb/>The Ferrier rearrangement, introduced to sugar chemistry in <lb/>1962, 34 is a useful route leading to 2-enopyranoses that hold a <lb/>high synthetic potential, as described in subsequent re-<lb/>views. 35-38 The structural diversity of the obtained 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides and their substrates allowed for a <lb/>thorough discussion of Ferrier rearrangement mechanism and <lb/>provided novel insight into its course and the factors <lb/>influencing it. The obtained saponins have an atypical pyranose <lb/>ring structure and, in most cases, α configuration of the <lb/>anomeric carbon atom, which have not been reported in the <lb/>literature so far. Chemoselective hydrogenation of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides provided 2,3-dideoxy dio-<lb/>sgenyl glycosides. The cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of <lb/>all synthesized saponins are presented along with a discussion <lb/>on the structure-activity relationships. <lb/>2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>2.1. Synthesis. Six O-acetylated glycals, namely, D-glucal <lb/>(1), D-galactal (2), L-rhamnal (3), L-fucal (4), D-xylal (5), and <lb/>L-arabinal (6), were prepared by adopting the procedures <lb/>described in the literature. 39 These were then subjected to <lb/>Ferrier rearrangement, where diosgenin acted as a nucleophile <lb/></body>

			<body>and subsequently de-O-acetylated (Scheme 1). Two catalysts, <lb/>boron trifluoride etherate (BF 3 × OEt 2 ) and iron(III) chloride <lb/>(FeCl 3 ), were tested for coupling glycals 1-6 with diosgenin. <lb/>FeCl 3 was found to be more efficient in these reactions. Among <lb/>the tested solvents, the best yields were obtained in a 2:1 <lb/>mixture of diethyl ether (Et 2 O) and dichloromethane (DCM). <lb/>The reactions of glycals with diosgenin, carried out in the <lb/>presence of FeCl 3 , took 5 min for acetylated D-glucal (1), L-<lb/>rhamnal (3), D-xylal (5), and L-arabinal (6). Acetylated D-<lb/>galactal (2) and L-fucal (4) required 15 min to complete the <lb/>reaction. All these reactions were highly stereoselective, <lb/>yielding 2,3-unsaturated glycosides with the α configuration <lb/>solely in the case of 8-10, the highly predominant α <lb/>configuration in the case of 7 (α/β ∼ 10:1), and the clearly <lb/>predominant β configuration in the case of 11 (α/β ∼ 1:3) and <lb/>12 (α/β ∼ 1:4). <lb/>To obtain 2,3-dideoxy diosgenyl glycosides (13-18), <lb/>hydrogenation of 7 using palladium on activated charcoal <lb/>under a hydrogen atmosphere was tested first. Unfortunately, <lb/>this procedure led to several compounds, including diosgenin <lb/>hydrogenation products and the products of hydrogenolysis of <lb/>the glycosidic bond. The latter reaction is justified because the <lb/>anomeric carbon in a 2,3-unsaturated glycoside is an allylic <lb/>carbon. It is known that allylic alcohols, 40 ethers, and esters 41 <lb/>Scheme 1.

			<body>tend to undergo hydrogenolysis. A similar unwanted reaction <lb/>was observed for 2,3-unsaturated sugar 1-O-pivalate when <lb/>subjected to transition-metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of a <lb/>double bond. 42 <lb/>Next, the azo compound diimide (HN�NH) was selected <lb/>for the transformation of 7-12 glycosides into 13-18. <lb/>Diimide is a reactive species used for hydrogenation of <lb/>multiple bonds and is known to react more efficiently with <lb/>disubstituted rather than with trisubstituted olefins. 43 Notably, <lb/>diimide did not cause hydrogenolysis of the C1-OPiv bond in <lb/>2,3-unsaturated sugar. 42 Hydrazine hydrate, oxidized by <lb/>hydrogen peroxide, 44 was used for the in situ generation of <lb/>diimide. We found this reagent to be efficient and selective, <lb/>causing hydrogenation of the double bond in the sugar part <lb/>only without disturbing the glycosidic bond or the double <lb/>bond in diosgenin. <lb/>2.2. Course of the Ferrier Rearrangement. 2.2.1. Gen-<lb/>eral Considerations. Acetylated glycals treated with nucleo-<lb/>philes in the presence of protic acid tend to undergo acid-<lb/>catalyzed electrophilic addition, where protonation of the <lb/>double bond is followed by the attack of the nucleophile at the <lb/>C1 carbon atom, leading to the formation of 2-deoxyglycosides <lb/>(Scheme 2). 35 The same glycals treated with a nucleophile in <lb/>the presence of a Lewis acid undergo a reaction, leading to 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides. This reaction is named the Ferrier <lb/>rearrangement after its researcher. 34 While the Ferrier <lb/>rearrangement can be carried out with the use of protic <lb/>acids, this procedure is often limited in terms of the chemical <lb/>yields due to a competitive addition reaction. Similarly, <lb/>synthesizing 2-deoxyglycosides from glycals in the presence <lb/>of a protic acid can yield the formation of 2,3-unsaturated <lb/>glycosides as byproducts. Unlike a protic acid, a Lewis acid <lb/>cannot initiate electrophilic addition; instead, it cleaves the 3-<lb/>OAc group, leading to the Ferrier rearrangement. <lb/>Two pathways of the Ferrier rearrangement are considered, <lb/>both involving a two-step process. The first pathway (Scheme <lb/>3A) should be formally classified as a nucleophilic substitution <lb/>reaction of the S N 1′ type. It involves an allylic carbon atom and <lb/>is characterized by the nucleophile attacking a position <lb/>different from where the nucleofuge leaves. 45 In the first step <lb/>of this pathway of the Ferrier rearrangement, a Lewis acid <lb/>cleaves the 3-OAc group in the acetylated glycal, leading to the <lb/>formation of a resonance-stabilized allyloxycarbenium ion <lb/>(Scheme 3A). Cleavage of any other OAc group in the <lb/>acetylated glycal would not result in the formation of such a <lb/>stable cation 46 and, therefore, does not occur. In the second <lb/>step of the first pathway, nucleophilic attack occurs in the <lb/>position where the partial positive charge of the formed cation <lb/>is the greatest, namely, on the anomeric carbon atom (C1). <lb/>This regioselectivity leads exclusively to the formation of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides. Rare cases of substitution at the C3 <lb/>carbon atom occur when using soft nucleophiles, e.g., RSH, <lb/>N 3 <lb/>-. 47 <lb/>The second considered pathway of the Ferrier rearrange-<lb/>ment (Scheme 3B) assumes that the departure of the 3-OAc <lb/>group is anchimerically assisted by the attack of the <lb/>neighboring 4-OAc group. In this case, the mechanism <lb/>involves a combination of two nucleophilic substitutions. <lb/>The first one is an S N 2 substitution where the trans-oriented 4-<lb/>OAc group acts as a nucleophile, pushing out the 3-OAc group <lb/>to form a dioxolenium ion. In the second step of this pathway <lb/>of the Ferrier rearrangement, the dioxolenium ion should <lb/>undergo an S N 2′ substitution where the nucleophile attacks the <lb/>less hindered C1 carbon atom. Importantly, anchimeric <lb/>assistance requires the 3-OAc and 4-OAc groups in glycal to <lb/>be antiperiplanarly oriented, which excludes the possibility of <lb/>such assistance in the cases of acetylated galactal, fucal, and <lb/>arabinal. <lb/>2.2.2. Influence of the Glycal Structure on the Course of <lb/>the Reaction. Regardless of which mechanism of the Ferrier <lb/>rearrangement (Scheme 3) is more likely, it is the first stage of <lb/>the reaction that determines its rate. This step involves <lb/>Scheme 2.

			<body>breaking of the C3-O3 bond and may be influenced by the <lb/>structure of the glycal. <lb/>The double bond of glycals, positioned between the C1 and <lb/>C2 carbon atoms of the pyranoid ring, forces the half-chair <lb/>conformation (H), where the O5, C1, C2, and C3 atoms lie in <lb/>one plane. The remaining two ring atoms (C4 and C5) are <lb/>located either above (superscript) or below (subscript) this <lb/>plane. This means that glycals remain in the 4 H 5 ⇄ 5 H 4 <lb/>conformational equilibrium (Figure 1). <lb/>The vinylogous anomeric effect (VAE), independently <lb/>introduced by Curran and Suh 48 and Denmark and Dappen, 49 <lb/>is an important factor influencing the conformational <lb/>equilibrium of acetylated glycals. 50,51 Actually, this is an <lb/>anomeric effect extended to the C3 carbon atom via a double <lb/>bond. Thus, VAE favors the pseudoaxial orientation of the <lb/>allylic ester group at the C3 carbon in acetylated glycals, and it <lb/>is rationalized by the n → π → σ* delocalization of electrons <lb/>(Figure 2A). Importantly, VAE not only stabilizes a given <lb/>glycal conformation (Figure 1) but it also weakens the C3-O3 <lb/>bond (Figure 2B), facilitating its dissociation and thereby <lb/>promoting the Ferrier rearrangement. 52 The ease of under-<lb/>going the Ferrier rearrangement is indeed correlated with the <lb/>population of conformations in which the VAE operates. The <lb/>populations of the respective conformations for glycals (Figure <lb/>1) were established based on the 1 H NMR spectra for 1 and <lb/>2 53 and based on the DFT calculations for 3-6. 51 Comparing <lb/>the stereoisomers in pairs, glucal (1) with a population of 40% <lb/>of the conformer is one in which VAE operates reacts more <lb/>readily than galactal (2) with a population of 12%. Similarly, <lb/>rhamnal (3) with 34% population reacts faster than fucal (4) <lb/>with a population of 26%. Both xylal (5) and arabinal (6) <lb/>reacted equally easily with our reaction, and both adopt mainly <lb/>the conformation in which VAE operates (93% and 92%, <lb/>respectively). <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>An appropriate glycal structure is undoubtedly necessary to <lb/>enable anchimeric assistance (Scheme 3A). Stereodirecting <lb/>participation of the ester neighboring group has a rich history <lb/>concerning the typical glycoside synthesis. 54 In the case of the <lb/>Ferrier rearrangement, the occurrence of anchimeric assistance <lb/>is cited to explain why acetylated glucal undergoes reaction <lb/>more readily than the acetylated galactal. 55 However, it is <lb/>evident that not all glycals require such assistance from the 4-<lb/>OAc group for effective Ferrier rearrangement. 37,56 The Ferrier <lb/>rearrangements presented herein also do not fully confirm the <lb/>involvement of the anchimeric assistance in the course of the <lb/>reaction mechanism. Such anchimeric assistance would be <lb/>expected in the cases of acetylated D-glucal (1), L-rhamnal (3), <lb/>and D-xylal (5), which possess trans-oriented 3-OAc and 4-<lb/>OAc groups (Figure 1). Indeed, reactions under identical <lb/>conditions proceed more rapidly for 1, 3, and 5 compared to 2 <lb/>and 4. However, there was no difference in the reaction time <lb/>between acetylated D-xylal (5) and L-arabinal (6); both were <lb/>completed within 5 min, suggesting that anchimeric assistance <lb/>does not determine these reaction times. This conclusion, <lb/>however, remains uncertain, as we did not examine the kinetics <lb/>of these reactions minute by minute. <lb/>2.2.3. Influence of the Intermediate&apos;s Structure on the <lb/>Course of the Reaction. Two different intermediates are <lb/>considered in the Ferrier rearrangement (Scheme 3): the <lb/>allyloxycarbenium ion and the dioxolenium ion. The <lb/>allyloxycarbenium ion derived from acetylated glucal was <lb/>identified and fully characterized by using a superacid. 57 In <lb/>turn, respective dioxolenium ions were identified when both <lb/>acetylated glucal and galactal were subjected to nano-<lb/>electrospray ionization followed by in-source fragmentation <lb/>of sodiated glycal precursor ions. 58 Meanwhile, anchimeric <lb/>assistance is impossible in the case of the acetylated galactal, <lb/>where the 3-OAc and 4-OAc groups are cis-oriented. <lb/>Therefore, the interconversion of the allyloxycarbenium ion <lb/>into the dioxolenium ion is the only explanation for the <lb/>formation of the latter in the case of the acetylated galactal. <lb/>This equilibrium state means that the formation of the <lb/>dioxolenium ion is not synonymous with anchimeric <lb/>assistance. <lb/>To gain knowledge about the stability of the intermediate <lb/>products of the Ferrier rearrangement, both the allyloxycarbe-<lb/>nium ions and the dioxolenium ions derived from glycals 1-5 <lb/>were optimized by using DFT methods. Glycal 6 was excluded <lb/>from these calculations because the intermediates formed from <lb/>it are enantiomers of the analogous intermediates formed from <lb/>glycal 5. All possible rotations of the exocyclic substituents in <lb/>both ions and in both the 5 H 4 and 4 H 5 conformations were <lb/>considered in these calculations. The optimized, lowest-energy <lb/>structures of the allyloxycarbenium ions (1′-5′) and the <lb/>dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) along with their relative Gibbs free <lb/>energies are presented in Figure 3. Cartesian coordinates of the <lb/>optimized structures are given in Table S3. <lb/>According to the results of DFT calculations (Figure 3), all <lb/>dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) are more stable than their <lb/>allyloxycarbenium counterparts (1′-5′), the difference being <lb/>2.04 (1″/1′), 4.57 (2″/2′), 2.61 (3″/3′), 4.31 (4″/4′), and <lb/>5.31 (5″/5′) kcal/mol. However, the most stable dioxolenium <lb/>ions cannot be formed directly from acetylated galactal (2), <lb/>fucal (4), nor arabinal (6). In these cases, if the dioxolenium <lb/>ion exists in the reaction mixture, it is a product of the <lb/>transformation of the respective allyloxycarbenium ion <lb/>(Scheme 3). This process is justified by the greater stability <lb/>of the dioxolenium ion compared to that of the allylox-<lb/>ycarbenium ion. An analogous state of equilibrium was <lb/>postulated between the acyloxonium ion (product of the <lb/>anchimeric assistance) and oxacarbenium ion (product of the <lb/>glycosidic bond dissociation) in the proposed mechanism of <lb/>acid hydrolysis of methyl glucosides. 59 The question is whether <lb/>the dioxolenium ion can react with diosgenin. Formally, it <lb/>would be a nucleophilic substitution of the S N 2′ type, which is <lb/>possible in the case of steric hindrance at the allylic C3 carbon <lb/>atom. However, such a reaction requires a strong nucleophile, <lb/>while diosgenin is not one. The S N 1′ mechanism seems more <lb/>likely in this situation. According to this mechanism, in the first <lb/>stage, the C3-O3 bond in the dioxolenium ion dissociates, <lb/>leading to the formation of the allyloxycarbenium ion, which is <lb/>attacked by the nucleophile in the second stage. Thus, the <lb/>presence of the allyloxycarbenium ion seems inevitable and <lb/>necessary for Ferrier rearrangement to occur, although the <lb/>existence of the dioxolenium ion in the reaction mixture <lb/>Figure 3. Lowest-energy structures of the allyloxycarbenium (1′-5′) and the dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) and their relative Gibbs free energies <lb/>[kcal/mol], related to the most stable form within a given group of stereoisomers. <lb/></body>

			<body>cannot be excluded. On the other hand, dioxolenium ions may <lb/>not form at all in the case of acetylated galactal (2), fucal (4), <lb/>and arabinal (6) if it is assumed that the rate constant of <lb/>glycoside formation is higher than the rate constant of the <lb/>allyloxycarbenium ion transformation into the dioxolenium ion <lb/>(k 4 &gt; k 3 ). <lb/>2.2.4. Influence of the Product&apos;s Structure on the Course <lb/>of the Reaction. The attack of the nucleophile on the C1 <lb/>carbon atom in the intermediate product of the Ferrier <lb/>rearrangement led to the formation of the α anomer and/or <lb/>the β anomer of the 2,3-unsaturated glycoside (Scheme 4). As <lb/>shown below, the ratio of the two anomers formed is closely <lb/>correlated with their conformational stability. <lb/>The double bond in the Ferrier rearrangement products <lb/>causes the C1, C2, C3, and C4 carbon atoms to lie in one <lb/>plane. Therefore, 2,3-unsaturated glycosides adopt the 0 H 5 or <lb/>5 <lb/>H 0 half-chair conformation (Figure 4). The conformational <lb/>stability of such a sugar ring depends on three factors. First, to <lb/>avoid unfavorable 1,3 pseudodiaxial interactions, the molecule <lb/>tends to favor the equatorial orientation of the terminal group <lb/>(red in Figure 4). Second, due to the anomeric effect (Figure <lb/>2C), a molecule tends to favor the pseudoaxial orientation of <lb/>the aglycone (green in Figure 4). Third, according to the allylic <lb/>effect, introduced and named by Ferrier and Sankey, 60 the <lb/>allylic ester group in 2,3-unsaturated pyranoses favors the <lb/>pseudoaxial orientation (Figure 2D). As proved below, not <lb/>only the allylic ester group but also the allylic hydroxyl group <lb/>prefers the pseudoaxial orientation (blue in Figure 4). <lb/>Probably, the allylic effect also applies to the pseudoaxial <lb/>orientation of the aglycone and overlaps with the anomeric <lb/>effect (Figure 2C). <lb/>All favorable factors mentioned above are found in the 0 H 5 <lb/>conformation identified for 8α and in the 5 H 0 conformation <lb/>identified for 10α (Figure 4). These 2,3-unsaturated glycosides <lb/>were formed by the reactions of per-O-acetyl-D-galactal (2) <lb/>and per-O-acetyl-D-fucal (4), respectively. The accumulation of <lb/>favorable factors makes the α glycosides 8α and 10α <lb/>particularly stable and causes the equilibrium of the <lb/>anomerization (Scheme 4) to be clearly shifted toward them. <lb/>It is worth noting that galactal (2) and fucal (4) react more <lb/>slowly than other glycals (kinetic aspect), but reactions <lb/>Scheme 4.

			<body>involving them are highly stereoselective and lead to the <lb/>thermodynamically most stable products. <lb/>It appears that the equatorial orientation of the terminal <lb/>group and the pseudoaxial orientation of the aglycone are <lb/>enough to make the half-chair conformation stable. This <lb/>statement concerns the 0 H 5 conformation identified for 7α and <lb/>the 5 H 0 conformation identified for 9α. Due to this <lb/>conformational stability, the equilibrium between the formed <lb/>anomers in the reaction of glucal (1) and rhamnal (3) with <lb/>diosgenin is again shifted toward the α anomer (7α and 9α), <lb/>but not as strongly as in the case of galactal (2) and fucal (4). <lb/>Small amounts of 7β are also obtained in the reaction of glucal <lb/>(1) with diosgenin. This anomer, however, is not thermody-<lb/>namically favored because it is conformationally unstable. In <lb/>the 0 H 5 conformation of 7β, the terminal group is oriented <lb/>favorably, but the aglycone and 4-OH groups are oriented <lb/>unfavorably. It is exactly the opposite in the 5 H 0 conformation <lb/>of 7β. None of the half-chair conformations of 7β are stable <lb/>enough to be fully adopted. Therefore, 7β remains in the 0 H 5 <lb/>⇄ 5 H 0 conformational equilibrium, which was proven based <lb/>on its 1 H NMR spectrum (see Section 2.3). The fact that 7β is <lb/>in conformational equilibrium indicates that the equatorial <lb/>orientation of the terminal hydroxymethyl group is the most <lb/>important factor in determining the conformational preference <lb/>of 2,3-unsaturated glycosides. This effect in the 0 H 5 <lb/>conformation of 7β is offset by both the anomeric effect and <lb/>the allylic effect in the 5 H 0 conformation of 7β. The lack of this <lb/>important factor in 11 and 12 completely changes the <lb/>anomeric preferences in the Ferrier rearrangement in the <lb/>case of acetylated xylal (5) and arabinal (6). The products of <lb/>their reactions are dominated by β anomers, which can adopt a <lb/>conformation where the other two favorable effects occur. This <lb/>is the 5 H 0 conformation in the case of 11β and the 0 H 5 <lb/>conformation in the case of 12β (it should be added that the <lb/>sugar parts of 11β and 12β are mirror images). The α <lb/>configuration of 2,3-unsaturated glycosides 11α and 12α, <lb/>unlike the β configuration of 11β and 12β, does not allow for <lb/>the aglycone and 3-OH groups to be pseudoaxially oriented at <lb/>the same time. As a result, the α anomers are thermodynami-<lb/>cally less stable than the β anomers, which shifts the <lb/>anomerization equilibrium in favor of the latter. The fact <lb/>that α anomers adopt a conformation in which the aglycone is <lb/>pseudoaxially oriented may mean that the anomeric effect is <lb/>stronger than the allylic effect caused by the 3-OH group. It is <lb/>also possible that both the anomeric and allylic effects act in <lb/>the pseudoaxial arrangement of the aglycone. On the other <lb/>hand, the fact that the β anomers (11β and 12β) dominate <lb/>over the α anomers (11α and 12α) in the products of reaction <lb/>of xylal (5) and arabinal (6) is evidence of the allylic effect <lb/>action caused by the 3-OH group. <lb/>2.3. Identification of the 0 H 5 and 5 H 0 Conformations. <lb/>The J 4′,5′ coupling constant is the most diagnostic for <lb/>distinguishing between the 5 H 0 and 0 H 5 conformations. If <lb/>the J 4′,5′ is in the range of 8-9 Hz, it means that the H5 proton <lb/>is axially oriented and the H4 proton is pseudoaxially oriented. <lb/>Such a situation takes place in the 0 H 5 conformation of 7α and <lb/>the 5 H 0 conformation of 9α (Figure 4). The J 3′,4′ ∼ 0 Hz <lb/>recorded for 7α and 9α is an additional confirmation of the <lb/>pseudoaxial orientation of the H4 proton. This value means <lb/>that the H3-C3-C4-H4 torsion angle is close to 90°. In the <lb/>half-chair conformations where the C1, C2, H2, C3, H3, and <lb/>C4 atoms are arranged in one plane, such a value of the torsion <lb/>angle occurs with the pseudoaxial orientation of the H4 <lb/>proton. The pseudoequatorial orientation of the H4 proton is <lb/>in accordance with the allylic effect and takes place in the most <lb/>stable conformations, i.e., the 0 H 5 for 8α and the 5 H 0 for 10α. <lb/>In these cases, the J 4′,5′ coupling constants are 2.14 or close to <lb/>zero. These values, in particular J 4′,5′ ∼ 0 Hz, clearly confirm <lb/>the conformation assigned to compounds 8α and 10α because <lb/>these are characteristic of the antiperiplanar orientation of the <lb/>H4 proton and the ring oxygen atom. 61 In turn, J 3′,4′ = 5.49 Hz <lb/>is typical for a torsion angle of about 10°. 62 <lb/>There is no terminal group on the C5 carbon atom in <lb/>pentopyranoses; thus, two different J 4′,5′ coupling constants are <lb/>recorded for them. The larger constant is for the axial H5 <lb/>proton, and the smaller one is for the equatorial H5 proton. If <lb/>one of these constants is 7.93 Hz and the other is 5.49, then <lb/>the H4 proton is pseudoaxially oriented. This situation occurs <lb/>in the 0 H 5 conformation of 11α and the 5 H 0 conformation of <lb/>12α. If one of these constants is 2.75 Hz and the other is 1.22 <lb/>Hz, then the H4 proton is pseudoequatorially oriented. This <lb/>situation takes place in the 5 H 0 conformation of 11β and the <lb/>0 H 5 conformation of 12β. The coupling constant J 3′,4′ = 5.19 <lb/>Hz additionally confirms the pseudoequatorial orientation of <lb/>the H4 proton in 11β and 12β. <lb/>The coupling constants recorded for 7β, particularly J 3′,4′ = <lb/>3.05/3.35 Hz and J 4′,5′ = 3.96 or 5.50 Hz, indicate the <lb/>conformational equilibrium of the 2,3-unsaturated sugar ring. <lb/>2.4. Cytotoxic Activity. The MTT assay was performed to <lb/>specify the cytotoxicity of 7-12 and 13-18 against prostate <lb/>cancer cells (PC3 line), breast cancer cells (MCF7 line), and <lb/>human keratinocytes (HaCaT line). The mentioned cell lines <lb/>were assayed by exposing them for 48 h to a medium <lb/>containing the studied compounds over a wide range of <lb/>concentrations. The viabilities of PC3 (A), MCF7 (B), and <lb/>HaCaT (C) cells with the tested compounds are presented in <lb/>Figure S16. The IC 50 values (dose of the compound which <lb/>caused a 50% reduction of cell viability) and the selectivity <lb/>indexes (SI), which show the ratio of IC 50 for normal cell line <lb/>to IC 50 for cancer cell line, are shown in Table S2. <lb/>The majority of the presented saponins, both 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated (7-12) and 2,3-dideoxy (13-18), are effectively <lb/>active against PC3 cancer cells at concentrations above 18-19 <lb/>μM (Figure S16). The effective action of these saponins on <lb/>MCF7 cancer cells requires rather high concentrations. The <lb/>2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycoside with the α-D-erythro <lb/>configuration (7α), which is derived from D-glucal (1) and <lb/>adopts the 0 H 5 conformation, is the most active saponin <lb/>against PC3 cancer cells. The respective IC 50 value for 7α is <lb/>16.84 μM (Table S2). This means that 7α exhibits larger <lb/>cytotoxicity against PC3 cancer cells than diosgenyl β-D-<lb/>glucopyranoside (7β) and diosgenin alone, both tested on <lb/>cervical HeLa and CaSki cancer cells. 31 Importantly, saponin <lb/>7α has a slightly stronger effect on PC3 cancer cells than on <lb/>the healthy cells tested (SI = 1.20). <lb/>Among the 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides, saponin <lb/>12β with β-L-glycero configuration and the 0 H 5 conformation <lb/>exhibits the best selectivity (SI 2.08). It has relatively good <lb/>activity against PC3 cells (IC 50 = 27.85 μM). The selectivity of <lb/>12β is twice as high as the selectivity of 8α. The latter saponin <lb/>differs from the former only in the presence of a terminal <lb/>hydroxymethyl group. It seems that the lack of a terminal <lb/>hydroxymethyl group is a good predictor of the selectivity of <lb/>the anticancer effect of saponins. Those that have a favorable <lb/>SI value (Table S2) for both cancer cell lines (ca. 2) have <lb/></body>

			<body>hydrogen (12β, 18β) or methyl (15α) in place of the CH 2 OH <lb/>group. <lb/>The configuration of the anomeric carbon atom of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated saponin 11 influences its anticancer activity. While <lb/>the α anomer (11α) exhibits activity against the PC3, MCF7, <lb/>and HaCaT cell lines at the IC 50 level of 24.44, 40.59, and <lb/>24.48 μM, respectively, the β anomer (11β) is completely <lb/>inactive in the case of all tested cell lines. This completely <lb/>inactive saponin 11β is a diastereoisomer of saponin 12β, <lb/>which is active against the tested cell lines at the IC 50 level of <lb/>27.85, 35.61, and 57.87 μM, respectively. In diastereoisomers <lb/>11β and 12β, the sugar parts are mirror images. This means <lb/>that the absolute configuration (D or L) of the sugar part is <lb/>relevant to the saponin activity. This situation changes when <lb/>we consider the analogous anomers of diosgenyl 2,3-dideoxy <lb/>glycosides (17). In their case, the β anomer (17β) is definitely <lb/>more active against all tested cell lines than the α anomer <lb/>(17α). In turn, the pair of diastereoisomers 17β and 18β, in <lb/>which the sugar parts are mirror images, do not differ <lb/>significantly in activity toward the tested cancer cell lines. The <lb/>presented results indicate that the presence or absence of a <lb/>double bond, which, among other things, determines the shape <lb/>of the pyranose ring, half-chair in the case of 11, and chair in <lb/>the case of 17, has a significant impact on the activity of the <lb/>tested compounds. <lb/>2.5. Hemolytic Activity. Regardless of numerous <lb/>pharmacological properties, saponins are known to induce <lb/>hemolysis, which limits their potential. 63 Therefore, the <lb/>hemolytic activities of compounds 7-12 and 13-18 were <lb/>determined. The results revealed that the tested compounds <lb/>have no hemolytic activity. The level of hemolysis for samples <lb/>exposed to the compounds at the highest concentrations was <lb/>not higher than 1% as compared to the positive controls. <lb/>2.6. Antimicrobial Activity. 2,3-Unsaturated (7-12) and <lb/>2,3-dideoxy (13-18) diosgenyl glycosides were tested for their <lb/>in vitro antimicrobial activity against seven strains of Gram-<lb/>positive bacteria and four strains of Gram-negative bacteria. <lb/>The measured minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) <lb/>values for G(+) bacteria are summarized in Table S2. The <lb/>MIC values for G(-) bacteria are not presented because these <lb/>are &gt;256 μg/mL in each case, which means a lack of activity at <lb/>the highest tested concentration. <lb/>Lack of activity against G(-) bacteria is typical for diosgenyl <lb/>glycosides. None of the diosgenyl glycosaminosides previously <lb/>tested by us showed such activity. 64-66 However, it is <lb/>surprising that 7-12 and 13-18 show such low activity <lb/>against G(+) bacteria (Table S2). In the best cases, some of <lb/>the 2,3-unsaturated saponins (7-12) are active against some <lb/>of the bacterial strains and cultures used only when the <lb/>compounds are applied at the highest tested concentration <lb/>(256 μg/mL). The same can be said about 2,3-dideoxy <lb/>saponins (13-18), although compounds 14α and 17α are an <lb/>exception here. These inhibit the growth of the Staphylococcus <lb/>aureus strains tested, including methicilin-resistant S. aureus <lb/>(ATCC codes 43,300 and 33,591). The antistaphylococcal <lb/>activity was achieved when 14α and 17α were applied at <lb/>concentrations of 64-256 and 128-256 mg/L, respectively <lb/>(Table S2). S. aureus is one of the most health-threatening <lb/>bacteria due to its ability to develop resistance to <lb/>antimicrobials and form biofilms on biomaterials. The results <lb/>obtained for compounds 14α and 17α encourage further study <lb/>of their antistaphylococcal activity. <lb/>3. SUMMARY <lb/>This work presents an efficient and stereoselective synthesis of <lb/>2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides mainly with the atypical α <lb/>configuration of the anomeric carbon atom. These saponins <lb/>were subsequently chemoselectively hydrogenated to 2,3-<lb/>dideoxy diosgenyl glycosides. <lb/>The configurational diversity of the used glycals and <lb/>obtained 2,3-unsaturated glycosides enabled an in-depth <lb/>discussion of the Ferrier rearrangement mechanism. This <lb/>discussion led to the following conclusions: (1) the VAE in <lb/>glycals may have a beneficial impact on the reaction course. (2) <lb/>Although the structure of glucal, rhamnal, and xylal allows for <lb/>anchimeric assistance, the latter is not necessary for the <lb/>formation of the dioxolenium ion. (3) The intermediate <lb/>product of the Ferrier rearrangement represents an equilibrium <lb/>mixture of the dioxolenium ion and allyloxycarbenium ion, <lb/>shifted in favor of the former. (4) It is the allyloxycarbenium <lb/>ion that undergoes the farther reaction with the nucleophile. <lb/>(5) The high stereoselectivity of the Ferrier rearrangement is <lb/>clearly correlated with the conformational stability of the <lb/>products. (6) Factors influencing this stability are ranked as the <lb/>equatorial orientation of the terminal group &gt; pseudoaxial <lb/>orientation of the aglycone &gt; pseudoaxial orientation of the 3-<lb/>OH group. <lb/>The new type of saponins presented exhibits moderate <lb/>anticancer activity and almost no antibacterial activity. The <lb/>structure-activity relationship discussion indicates the follow-<lb/>ing: (1) the absence of a terminal hydroxymethyl group in a <lb/>sugar moiety is a good predictor of cytotoxic selectivity. (2) <lb/>The anomeric carbon atom configuration influences anticancer <lb/>activity. (3) Both the configuration and conformation of the <lb/>pyranose ring affect the activity of the tested saponins. <lb/>4. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>4.1. Synthetic Procedures and Results of Analysis. <lb/>4.1.1. General Methods. Solvents and chemical reagents were <lb/>purchased and used without further purification. The 1 H and 13 C <lb/>NMR spectra were recorded on the Bruker Avance III 500 MHz <lb/>(500.13/125.76 MHz), using CDCl 3 as a solvent with internal Me 4 Si. <lb/>Structural assignments were made with additional information from <lb/>COSY and HSQC experiments. The digital resolution of the 1 H NMR <lb/>spectra was 0.305 Hz/point. Positive-ion mode MALDI-TOF mass <lb/>spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex III spectrometer with 4-<lb/>cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrixes. <lb/>High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were recorded <lb/>using a Nexera X2 ultra high performance liquid chromatographyin-<lb/>strument coupled to a Triple TOF 5600+ (SCIEX) mass <lb/>spectrometer equipped with a duoelectrospray interface, operated in <lb/>the negative ionization mode as the monoisotopic formate adducts. <lb/>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum <lb/>plates coated with E. Merck Kieselgel 60 F 254 , using the following <lb/>eluent systems (v/v): A, 2:1 toluene/AcOEt; B, 6:1 toluene/AcOEt; <lb/>C, 9:1 toluene/AcOEt; D, 1:2 toluene/AcOEt; E, 2:1 n-heptane/ <lb/>AcOEt; F, 4:1 n-heptane/AcOEt. For the compounds detection, the <lb/>dry plates were sprayed with 1% H 2 SO 4 in MeOH and heated at ca. <lb/>200 °C in a stream of hot air. Filtration through silica gel was <lb/>performed on MN Kieselgel 60 (&lt;0.08 mm). Column flash <lb/>chromatography was conducted using a PuriFlash 450 instrument <lb/>with a UV-DAD detector on PuriFlash SI-HP 50 μm columns, using <lb/>one of the above-mentioned eluent systems. <lb/>4.1.2. Per-O-acetylated Glycals (1-6).

Cytotoxicity Assay. An MTT assay was performed to specify <lb/>the cytotoxicity of the studied compounds against breast cancer cells <lb/>(MCF-7 line, ATCC), prostate cancer cells (PC3 line, ATCC) and <lb/>human keratinocytes (HaCaT line, CLS). The MCF-7 cell line was <lb/>cultured in an RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher <lb/>Scientific), the PC3 cell line in a F-12K medium (Gibco, Thermo <lb/>Fisher Scientific), and the HaCaT cell line in a high-glucose DMEM <lb/>(Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each medium was supplemented <lb/>with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and <lb/>antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Gibco, Thermo Fisher <lb/>Scientific). Cells were seeded at a density of 4000 per well into 96-<lb/>well plates and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The cells <lb/>were treated with studied compounds in a concentration range of <lb/>0.1-100 μg/mL or with a vehicle (1% DMSO) as a control and <lb/>subsequently incubated for 48 h. Thereafter, the MTT salt solution <lb/>(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, <lb/>VWR) was added at a concentration of 4 mg/mL (25 μL per well), <lb/>and the obtained product (formazan) after 3 h of incubation was <lb/>dissolved in DMSO. An EnSpire microplate reader (PerkinElmer) was <lb/>used to measure absorbance at 570 nm (the reference wavelength was <lb/>660 nm). The viability of the control cells was taken as 100%. Three <lb/>independent experiments were conducted in triplicate. Statistical <lb/>analysis of the results and estimation of IC 50 values were performed <lb/>using GraphPad Prism 7 software. <lb/>4.3. Hemolysis Assay. The hemolytic activity was determined on <lb/>erythrocytes from defibrinated sheep blood (Graso, Poland). The red <lb/>blood cells were suspended in phosphoric buffer (PBS; AppliChem, <lb/>Germany) to a final concentration of 4% and added to a polystyrene <lb/>96-well plate and exposed to tested compounds (concentration range <lb/>of 256-0.25 mg/L) for 1 h at 37 °C. The compounds were <lb/>suspended in DMSO and serially diluted in PBS (the final <lb/>concentration of DMSO in samples did not exceed 5%; it was <lb/>confirmed that such concentration of DMSO did not cause <lb/>hemolysis). After incubation, the plates were centrifuged (800g, 10 <lb/>min, 4 °C) and absorbance of supernatant was measured with a <lb/>microplate spectrophotometer under a wavelength of 590 nm <lb/>(Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO, Thermofisher). Sheep erythrocytes <lb/>exposed to 1% Triton X-100 served as a positive control (100% <lb/>hemolysis), while the suspensions were in PBS. <lb/>4.4. Determination of Antibacterial Activity. MIC was <lb/>determined with the dilution method in Mueller-Hinton II broth <lb/>(MHB II) on 96-well polystyrene plates. The reference strains (Polish <lb/>Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland) of Gram-positive bacteria <lb/>(Enterococcus faecium ATCC 29,212, S. aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus <lb/>ATCC 43,300, S. aureus ATCC 12,598, S. aureus ATCC 25,923, S. <lb/>aureus, ATCC 33,591, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14,990) and <lb/>Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumanii ATCC 23,506, <lb/>Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700,603, <lb/></body>

			<body>Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027) were suspended in MHB II <lb/>medium to initial inoculum of 10 5 cfu/mL. The microbes were <lb/>exposed to graded concentrations of tested compounds (range 0.5-<lb/>256 mg/L) for 18 h at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. The <lb/>compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with PBS. The <lb/>final concentration of DMSO in a sample with microbes did not <lb/>exceed 5% (it was confirmed that this amount of DMSO did not affect <lb/>the microbial growth). MIC was taken as the lowest concentration at <lb/>which no microbial growth was observed. The experiments were <lb/>performed in triplicate. <lb/>4.5. Methodology of DFT Calculations. All the calculated <lb/>structures were built in the MOLDEN program. 67 The structures <lb/>were optimized using M06-2X functional 68 and Pople&apos;s 6-311+G** <lb/>basis set. The M062X function is recommended to solve a wide <lb/>variety of chemical problems, including the study of conformational <lb/>equilibria. 69 It was previously used by us in conformational studies of <lb/>glycals, giving high agreement with the experiment. 70 The <lb/>optimizations were considered satisfactory if the standard criteria <lb/>were fulfilled, that is, the energy difference between the optimization <lb/>cycles was lower than 1 × 10 -6 hartree and a gradient of &lt;1 × 10 -4 au <lb/>was achieved. Standard convergence criteria were employed for all <lb/>calculations. The Hessian calculations were performed for any <lb/>geometry optimized to confirm that the stationary points correspond-<lb/>ing to the minimum have been obtained with no negative eigenvalues. <lb/>The Hessian calculations were also used to estimate zero-point <lb/>vibrational effects, molecular entropies, and thermal energy <lb/>contributions according to statistical thermodynamics formulas. The <lb/>relative energy of the ith conformer is the sum of electronic and zero-<lb/>point energy, referring to the energy of the most stable conformer. In <lb/>turn, the relative Gibbs free energy of the ith conformer is the sum of <lb/>its electronic energy and thermal correction to Gibbs free energy, <lb/>referred to as the Gibbs free energy of the most stable conformer. All <lb/>calculations were performed in the gas phase at standard temperature <lb/>and pressure conditions (298.15 K and 1 atm.), using the GAUSSIAN <lb/>09 package. 71 <lb/></body>
