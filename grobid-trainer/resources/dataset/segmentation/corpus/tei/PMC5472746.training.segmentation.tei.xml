			<body>A <lb/>naplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a member of the <lb/>insulin receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and is <lb/>primarily expressed in the central nervous system 1,2 . Over <lb/>a dozen ALK fusion partners have been identified in several <lb/>cancer types 1-4 , and this has ultimately led to clinical translation <lb/>and United States Food and Drug Administration approval of <lb/>ALK inhibitors 5 as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive lung <lb/>cancer patients. Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a next-generation, <lb/>small-molecule inhibitor of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase <lb/>c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which has a kinase domain that is <lb/>physiologically related to and also inhibits ALK 6 . This orally <lb/>available, ATP-competitive inhibitor has shown excellent <lb/>therapeutic potential against ROS1-driven fusion cancers, <lb/>and significantly improved inhibitory activity compared with <lb/>the first-generation-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) <lb/>including the ALK/mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor/ROS <lb/>inhibitor, crizotinib (Xalkori) 7 , as well as next-generation ALK <lb/>and ALK/ROS1 inhibitors, ceritinib and alectinib 8,9 . Most ALK <lb/>inhibitors (and all known TKIs) are limited by acquired resistance <lb/>to therapy, generally driven by mutations that alter the kinase <lb/>domain of ALK, activation of other oncogenic signals or <lb/>pharmacokinetic (PK) issues with the drug and are generally <lb/>not optimized for brain penetration 10 . A common site of <lb/>metastases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is in <lb/>the brain where previous generation ALK inhibitors have limited <lb/>effectiveness, and may be attributed to poor blood-brain barrier <lb/>(BBB) penetration or active transport out of the brain by efflux <lb/>pumps 11-13 . Lorlatinib was specifically designed to address this <lb/>unmet clinical need for robust brain penetration and activity <lb/>against TKI-resistant ALK mutants, including the crizotinib-, <lb/>alectinib-and ceritinib-resistant fusion of echinoderm <lb/>microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML-4)-ALK Gly1202Arg <lb/>mutant 14 . This drug is presently undergoing Phase I/II clinical <lb/>trial investigations (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01970865) <lb/>in ROS1 and ALK fusion-positive NSCLC patients 13,15-21 . <lb/>Unfortunately, imaging receptor tyrosine kinases and their <lb/>associated signal transduction pathways with isotopologues of <lb/>potent and selective drugs are rarely explored for oncology and <lb/>neuroimaging 22-27 with positron emission tomography (PET). <lb/>This lack of effort is partially attributed to the additional <lb/>challenges of imaging intracellular targets, compared to high-<lb/>density receptor and enzyme targets at the extracellular domain, <lb/>and competition at binding sites with high intracellular levels of <lb/>ATP. These difficulties are further exacerbated by the challenging <lb/>radiochemistry required to prepare isotopologues of the <lb/>structurally complex potent and selective TKIs. A PET <lb/>radiotracer for ALK could aid many ongoing clinical trials with <lb/>ALK-targeted therapeutics by indicating the success and extent of <lb/>engagement by ALK in the periphery and central nervous system, <lb/>as well as for occupancy studies to assess dose-response and to <lb/>understand the PK properties of a labelled drug. Although this <lb/>effort has been hindered by the low BBB permeability of <lb/>crizotinib 28 and related compounds, there is a critical need to <lb/>develop a PET neuroimaging agent for ALK; hence, our goal is to <lb/>evaluate the PK of lorlatinib by PET for clinical oncology. Such a <lb/>radiotracer would enable us to further our understanding <lb/>of ALK-drug concentrations in normal brain and in brain <lb/>metastases. In the present work, we synthesize carbon-11 <lb/>( 11 C; b þ , t ½ ¼ 20.4 min) and fluorine-18 ( 18 F; b þ , t ½ ¼ 109.7 min)-<lb/>labelled isotopologues of lorlatinib and carry out preliminary <lb/>biodistribution and PET imaging using [ 11 C]lorlatinib in <lb/>tumour-bearing rodents and non-human primates (NHPs). <lb/>Results <lb/>Precursor synthesis. With the goal of exploring both 11 C and 18 F <lb/>radiolabelling of lorlatinib, ((10R) À 7-amino-12-fluoro-2,10, <lb/>16-trimethyl-15-oxo-10,15,16,17-tetrahydro-2H À 8,4-(metheno) <lb/>pyrazolo[4,3 À h][2,5,11]-benzoxadiazacyclotetradecine-3-carbo-<lb/>nitrile (PF-06463922; (R)-1), five compounds ((R)-2 À (R)-6; <lb/>Fig. 1) were synthesized to serve as potential precursors. <lb/>Compounds (R)-2 and (R)-3 were intended to be evaluated <lb/>for 11 C labelling through methylation of the amide nitrogen, <lb/>whereas compound (R)-6 was a desirable intermediate to assess <lb/>an iodonium ylide labelling strategy 29-31 . Compounds (R)-4 and <lb/>(R)-5 were attractive from the perspective of utilizing nucleophilic <lb/>aromatic substitution approach to access the 18 F-labelled material. <lb/>Synthesis of labelling precursors for lorlatinib ((R)-1). <lb/>Compound (R)-2 was originally synthesized as a standard for <lb/>metabolite studies and also serves as a precursor for 11 C labelling <lb/>with [ 11 C]CH 3 I (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 2). With compound <lb/>(R)-2 in hand, it may be possible to selectively methylate the <lb/>amide nitrogen with [ 11 C]CH 3 I; however, a more likely labelling <lb/>strategy would involve protection of the aminopyridine motif, <lb/>and carry out a two-step alkylation/deprotection sequence. <lb/>Attempting to simply selectively bis-Boc-protect the aminopyr-<lb/>idine compound (R)-2, led under standard conditions, to mainly <lb/>the tri-Boc-protected compound, and all attempts to selectively <lb/>remove the Boc group from the amide nitrogen failed. With these <lb/>results, and a limited amount of materials in hand, an alternative <lb/>approach to (R)-3 was devised. As we have previously reported 6 , <lb/>a direct arylation can be utilized to form the macrocyclic ring, <lb/>although the success of this approach is to some degree enabled <lb/>by protection of the amino pyridine 6 . This is reinforced by a poor <lb/>yield (o5%) being obtained when direct cyclization was <lb/>attempted to form compound (R)-2. However, this approach is <lb/>successful for (R)-3 (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 3). <lb/>Synthesis of [ 11 C]Lorlatinib ([ 11 C](R)-1). Owing to the <lb/>short half-life of carbon-11, our initial attempts to synthesize <lb/>[ 11 C](R)-1 employed a one-step direct methylation of unpro-<lb/>tected precursor (R)-2 with [ 11 C]CH 3 I using the &apos;Loop Method&apos; 32 <lb/>(Fig. 2). In this established method, the entire reaction is carried <lb/>out on an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) loop <lb/>prior to purification, and no losses to transfer of reagents occur. <lb/>The &apos;Loop Method&apos; is commonly used instead of vial-based <lb/>11 C-methylation reactions, because of its simplicity (no heating or <lb/>cooling required) as well as ease of automation, including <lb/>adaptation to the commercial radiosynthesis modules. Labelling <lb/>of precursor (R)-2 was initiated by flowing [ 11 C]CH 3 I through <lb/>an HPLC loop coated with a thin film of (R)-2 (1 mg) in <lb/>N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with 0.7 equivalents of <lb/>tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH, 1 M in methanol) at <lb/>room temperature. After 5 min, the contents of the HPLC loop <lb/>were eluted with 10% water in acetonitrile to give 25% <lb/>uncorrected radiochemical yield (RCY) of a labelled compound. <lb/>Analysis of the crude reaction mixture by HPLC indicated that <lb/>the major radiolabelled product had a similar retention time as <lb/>the desired product, but was not easily separated from the <lb/>precursor (R)-2, using semipreparative HPLC. It cannot be ruled <lb/>out that the major radiolabelled product in this reaction was not <lb/>the desired product, [ 11 C](R)-1, but was the methyl pyridinium <lb/>salt [ 11 C](R)-7. Methylation of 2-aminopyridines occurs <lb/>favourably at the pyridine nitrogen because of resonance <lb/>electron-releasing properties of the amino group, which leads <lb/>to enhanced nucleophilicity of the pyridine 33 . In light of the <lb/>challenge to isolate [ 11 C](R)-1 from the reaction mixture <lb/>with confidence and suitable radiochemical purity for clinical <lb/>translation, we abandoned the 1-step strategy and focused <lb/>on a more robust 2-step 11 C-labelling process that employs a <lb/>diBoc-protected amine for routine radiotracer production. <lb/></body>

			<body>In order to attenuate the reactivity of the pyridine and to <lb/>favour selective labelling of the amide functionality, a doubly <lb/>Boc-protected molecule, precursor (R)-3, was used in a two-step <lb/>labelling employing [ 11 C]CH 3 I via the aforementioned &apos;Loop <lb/>Method&apos;, followed by purification and hydrolysis on a modified <lb/>commercial radiofluorination unit (GE TracerLab FX FN ; <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 13). By using the two-step methylation <lb/>procedure (Fig. 2), the labelled intermediate [ 11 C](R)-8 could be <lb/>easily separated from the precursor (R)-3, by semipreparative <lb/>HPLC, and could then be rapidly deprotected and purified <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 14). A slow stream of [ 11 C]CH 3 I in helium <lb/>was pushed into an HPLC loop containing (R)-3, TBAOH and <lb/>DMF over 4 min. The mixture was allowed to react in the loop, <lb/>and after 5 min the solution was injected directly into the HPLC <lb/>system for semipreparative purification. The large difference in <lb/>the chromatographic properties of protected labelled product <lb/>[ 11 C](R)-8 allowed for the complete separation of (R)-8 from the <lb/>starting precursor (R)-3. The desired radiolabelled product, <lb/>[ 11 C](R)-8, was collected by HPLC separation and the Boc <lb/>groups were deprotected with HCl (6 N) in ethanol at 80 °C for <lb/>5 min. The resulting solution was cooled, and then neutralized <lb/>with NaOH (1 N) and buffered with sodium acetate (3 M). The <lb/>final product was purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) and <lb/>reformulated in 10% ethanol in saline to provide [ 11 C]lorlatinib <lb/>([ 11 C](R)-1), in 3% uncorrected RCY (17% decay-corrected) at <lb/>end of synthesis (50 min) and a high specific activity of <lb/>3 Ci mmol À 1 , with 495% radiochemical purity. <lb/>This work demonstrates the proof of concept labelling of a <lb/>two-step 11 C reaction that can be obtained on a commercial <lb/>radiofluorination unit with a rapid and simple reversible <lb/>modification that does not alter the standard plumbing of the <lb/>GE TracerLab FX FN . We anticipate that this methodology may <lb/>find applications in other 11 C-labelling sequences involving <lb/>two-step reactions 34,35 . <lb/>In vivo PET imaging of [ 11 C](R)-1. PET imaging studies were <lb/>initially performed with [ 11 C](R)-1 in NHPs. In each of two <lb/>rhesus macaques, high initial uptake was seen in the brain after <lb/>intravenous injection of [ 11 C](R)-1, and is consistent with the <lb/>previously reported brain penetration properties of the <lb/>non-radioactive molecule 6 . Whole-body dynamic PET imaging <lb/>revealed radioactivity primarily in the liver and kidneys (Fig. 3a), <lb/>the latter exhibiting signal primarily at early time points that <lb/>progressively shifted to the urinary bladder (Supplementary <lb/>Figs 22 and 23). The peak-measured brain concentrations were <lb/>locally high with the cerebellum exceeding a standardized uptake <lb/>value (SUV) of 2 at B10 min post injection (Fig. 3b); the <lb/>maximum measured per cent injected dose in the brain was 1.4% <lb/>at B10 min post injection. SUV time activity curves exhibit rapid <lb/>uptake, followed by fast washout of the radiotracer in normal <lb/>NHPs (Fig. 3c). Regional uptake exhibits modest heterogeneity <lb/>but is generally concordant with expected ALK distribution, with <lb/>highest [ 11 C]lorlatinib concentrations in the cerebellum, frontal <lb/>cortex and thalamus; intermediate levels in other cortical grey <lb/>matter; and lowest values in the white matter 36 . <lb/>It is noteworthy that a preliminary assessment of tumour <lb/>uptake of this radiotracer was also carried out in mice bearing <lb/>subcutaneous human H3122 (EML4-ALK-positive) NSCLC <lb/>xenografts and evaluated by PET-CT imaging in conjunction <lb/>with blocking studies (Supplementary Figs 24 and 25). Briefly, our <lb/>initial results show that the tumour uptake reached its plateau in <lb/>B30-60 min after injection of [ 11 C](R)-1 (with 2.2-2.37% ID/g) <lb/>and co-injection with (R)-1 resulted in a significant decrease in <lb/>the tumour uptake (o0.4% ID/g) during the entire imaging <lb/>course of 90 min. <lb/>The dosimetry of the 11 C-tracer was determined in NHPs after <lb/>the injection of [ 11 C](R)-1. Doses from any carbon-11 compound <lb/>are generally low, because of the short physical half-life 37 . <lb/>Radioactivity levels were measured in various organs of the <lb/>animals at 13 time points at up to B120 min post injection. <lb/>With these data, the liver dose appears to be 0.021 mSv MBq À 1 , <lb/>and the effective dose appears to be 0.0035 mSv MBq À 1 <lb/>(Supplementary Table 1). The dosimetry estimates from NHPs <lb/>are consistent with those of other 11 C-labelled compounds. <lb/>Clinical translation of this radiotracer is warranted and regulatory <lb/>10 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>0.020 <lb/>Frontal cortex <lb/>Thalamus <lb/>Cerebellum <lb/>White matter <lb/>0.015 <lb/>0.010 <lb/>0.005 <lb/>0.000 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0 <lb/>c <lb/>b <lb/>a <lb/>30 <lb/>60 <lb/>Time (min) <lb/>90 <lb/>120 <lb/>0 <lb/>Whole body PET (SUV) <lb/>%I.D./g <lb/>Brain PET (SUV) <lb/>Regional uptake (SUV) <lb/>0 <lb/>Figure 3 | Non-human primate PET imaging of [ 11 C]lorlatinib.

			<body>submissions should be facilitated, given that further toxicity <lb/>studies are not required. <lb/>Synthesis of labelling precursors for [ 18 F]lorlatinib. The longer <lb/>half-life of fluorine-18 offers many advantages for radiosynthesis <lb/>and imaging protocols compared to carbon-11. Specifically, <lb/>the ability to conduct several scans from a single production <lb/>of an 18 F-labelled radiotracer, facilitation of widespread use <lb/>and multicentre trials, as well as longer scanning protocols <lb/>can be achieved. Therefore, 18 F-labelling is a preferred option, <lb/>particularly since a direct isotopologue of lorlatinib could be <lb/>prepared. For the corresponding nitro-aromatic precursors <lb/>needed for 18 F-labelling (4 and 5; Supplementary Fig. 7), both the <lb/>standard amidation and the direct arylation approaches were also <lb/>investigated to access this novel core. Rather than start with <lb/>enantiopure starting material, we pursued a less labour-intensive <lb/>late-stage chiral separation, and then correlated the product to the <lb/>desired enantiomer. <lb/>Our current synthetic methodology was useful in securing <lb/>enough substrate for initial labelling investigations; however, <lb/>in order to provide a sustainable supply of key intermediates, <lb/>a higher-yielding methodology was needed. Synthesis of cores <lb/>such as (R)-4, (R)-5 and potentially (R)-6 became key to the <lb/>success of the project. A logistical challenge was to determine at <lb/>what point to carry out the chiral separation. Having correlated <lb/>the stereochemistry of the chiral alcohol (S)-19 to the final <lb/>macrocycles, we decided that it would be more facile in terms of <lb/>scale to carry out the separation on either 4 or 5 with the final <lb/>decision being based on which displayed better solubility and <lb/>more efficient chiral separation. In addition, investigating a direct <lb/>arylation route to these compounds could potentially lead to an <lb/>improvement in yield, avoidance of issues with nitrile hydrolysis <lb/>as well as a shortening in the synthetic route (Fig. 4). <lb/>Using the syntheses outlined in Fig. 4, multigram quantities of <lb/>racemic 5 could be obtained, which could then be separated by <lb/>chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Correlation of <lb/>the materials obtained with the compound obtained from (S)-19 <lb/>enabled the isolation of (R)-5 on a gram scale. <lb/>The harsh conditions required for fluorodenitration of <lb/>both (R)-4 and (R)-5 lead to significant decomposition of the <lb/>macrocycle, in particular with respect to the sensitivity of the <lb/>nitrile moiety (vide infra). As such, alternative approaches to <lb/>18 F-labelling were also investigated. We recently reported on a <lb/>spirocyclic hypervalent iodine(III)-mediated radiofluorination <lb/>strategy, based on iodonium ylides to afford 18 F-aryl <lb/>fluorides in high RCYs 29 . The technique involves stable, easily <lb/>purified precursors and is readily implemented with standard <lb/>workup procedures. The conceptual advantages of excellent <lb/>regioselectivity and viability of incorporation of 18 F into a wide <lb/>array of non-activated (hetero) arenes make this methodology <lb/>suitable for use on non-activated aromatic rings. With this <lb/>methodology in mind, access to (R)-6 became attractive, and we <lb/>were confident that this compound could be accessed from the <lb/>enantiopure (R)-5. As shown in Fig. 5, Boc-protection again <lb/>provides (R)-4, which could be reduced to (R)-12 using sodium <lb/>dithionite. Diazotization/iodination was then utilized to install <lb/>the requisite iodide to form (R)-6. <lb/>The corresponding ylide (R)-13 was prepared following the <lb/>general literature procedure 29 (Supplementary Fig. 10); in short, <lb/>the aryl iodide (R)-6 was reacted with Selectfluor and <lb/>trimethylsilyl acetate to form the intermediate iododiacetoxy <lb/>compound. A basic solution of 6,10-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane-7, <lb/>9-dione was added to the iododiacetoxy intermediate and <lb/>the reaction allowed to proceed until full conversion of the <lb/>iododiacetoxy starting materials. After purification, the iodonium <lb/>ylide (R)-13 was isolated in 36% yield. <lb/>Radiosynthesis of [ 18 F]lorlatinib. Attempted manual fluor-<lb/>odenitration with [ 18 F]Et 4 NF ([ 18 F]TEAF) was performed using <lb/>the nitro precursors (3-4 mg) in dimethylsulphoxide with heating <lb/>ranging from 160 to 215 °C for 15 min; however, [ 18 F](R)-1 could <lb/>not be identified in the reaction mixture. The radiosynthesis was <lb/>then attempted using the commerical microfluidic system 38 ; <lb/>however, complete HPLC separation of the nitro precursor from <lb/>the final product proved to be problematic (Supplementary <lb/>Figs 16 and 17).

			<body>our iodonium ylide-based radiochemistry 29-31 proved to be the <lb/>most effective method for preparation of the 18 F isotopologue of <lb/>(R)-1 (Fig. 5), resulting in a 14% uncorrected RCY, relative to <lb/>starting [ 18 F]fluoride (compared to the 1% RCY by microfluidic <lb/>fluorodenitration 39 ), and in a radiochemical purity of 497%. <lb/>We anticipate that this methodology will be applicable for <lb/>18 F-labelling of other mildly activated aromatic clinical <lb/>candidates 40 . This development of [ 18 F](R)-1 is also worthy of <lb/>further investigations in vivo. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Clinically useful amounts of the 11 C-and 18 F-isotopologues of <lb/>the ROS1/ALK inhibitor lorlatinib were synthesized, enabling the <lb/>possibility for in vivo quantification of ALK-drug concentrations <lb/>and brain metastases. To accommodate the non-traditional <lb/>radiolabelling strategies that were required, five precursor <lb/>molecules were synthesized via multistep syntheses and <lb/>strategically placed chiral separations. Carbon-11-and fluorine-<lb/>18-labelled lorlatinib were prepared in good RCYs and purities <lb/>via a unique and fully automated 2-step 11 C-labelling strategy, as <lb/>well as our iodonium ylide-based radiofluorination methodology. <lb/>The initial PET imaging study was designed to confirm that <lb/>[ 11 C]lorlatinib readily crosses the BBB. Our future work <lb/>with [ 11 C]lorlatinib includes further PET imaging in rodent <lb/>tumour models, normal NHPs, with concurrent automation and <lb/>preclinical translation of [ 18 F]lorlatinib. <lb/>Methods <lb/>General chemistry experimental procedures. Starting materials and other <lb/>reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further <lb/>purification unless otherwise stated. Lorlatinib, also known as PF-06463922, is now <lb/>commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich. All reactions were under a <lb/>positive pressure of nitrogen, argon or with a drying tube, at ambient temperature <lb/>(unless otherwise stated), in anhydrous solvents, unless otherwise indicated. <lb/>Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on glass-backed Silica <lb/>Gel 60_F 254 plates (Analtech (0.25 mm) and eluted with the appropriate solvent <lb/>ratios (v/v). Flash column chromatography was performed using a Biotage Isolera <lb/>One system and preloaded Biotage columns. Silica gel for flash chromatography <lb/>was high-purity grade 40-63 mm pore size and was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. <lb/>Reactions were monitored by HPLC or TLC and terminated as judged by the <lb/>consumption of starting material. The TLC plates were visualized by ultraviolet, <lb/>phosphomolybdic acid stain or iodine stain. Microwave-assisted reactions were <lb/>carried out in a Biotage Initiator. All test compounds showed 495% purity as <lb/>determined by combustion analysis or by HPLC. HPLC conditions were as follows: <lb/>X-Bridge C18 column at 80 °C, 4.6 mm Â 150 mm, 5 mm, 5-95% MeOH/H 2 O <lb/>buffered with 0.2% formic acid/0.4% ammonium formate, 3 min run, flow rate <lb/>1.2 ml min À 1 , ultraviolet detection (l ¼ 254, 224 nm). <lb/>Spectroscopy. Multi-NMR spectra were recorded on either a Bruker 300 MHz, a <lb/>Bruker 400 MHz, or a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer, and resonances <lb/>are given in parts per million (p.p.m.) relative residual solvent. 1 H NMR spectra <lb/>were obtained as DMSO-d 6 or CDCl 3 solutions as indicated (reported in p.p.m.), <lb/>using chloroform as the reference standard (7.25 p.p.m.) or DMSO-d 6 <lb/>(2.50 p.p.m.), unless otherwise stated. Peak multiplicities are reported using the <lb/>following abbreviations: s ¼ singlet, d ¼ doublet, t ¼ triplet, m ¼ multiplet, <lb/>br ¼ broadened, dd ¼ doublet of doublets, dt ¼ doublet of triplets. J coupling <lb/>constants, when given, are reported in hertz (Hz). HRMS spectra were recorded on <lb/>an Agilent 6,220 ESI TOF mass spectrometer using flow injection analysis. Mass <lb/>spectrum data were also obtained by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry <lb/>(LCMS) on an Agilent instrument using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization <lb/>(APCI) or electrospray ionization (ESI). Selected infrared spectra were recorded <lb/>from neat compounds on a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR. <lb/>Synthesis of labelling precursors for [ 11 C]lorlatinib. Compound (R)-2 was <lb/>originally synthesized as a standard for metabolite studies and also serves as a <lb/>precursor for 11 C-labelling with [ 11 C]CH 3 I (Supplementary Fig. 1). Initial one-pot <lb/>Suzuki coupling between (R)-15 and the pyrazole 16, using B 2 pin 2 and CataCXium <lb/>A as a ligand followed by N-Boc deprotection then ester hydrolysis led to (R)-19, <lb/>the precursor for the macrolactamization. Ring-closure is known to be the <lb/>challenging step in the formation of macrocycles, and often strategies such as <lb/>high dilution and slow addition techniques are utilized to address this. The <lb/>conformational preferences of the precursor also have a strong influence on the <lb/>success of the ring formation 41 , and herein a modest yield was obtained after <lb/>EDCI-mediated ring formation (it is interesting to contrast this with the yields <lb/>obtained in the case of the clinical candidate (R)-2, which differs by an additional <lb/>methyl group on the amide nitrogen, which leads to a 10-20% increase in yield for <lb/>the cyclization step probably due to the greater nucleophilicity of the secondary <lb/>amine). Other amide-bond-forming reagents were not tested in this step, and the <lb/>presence of cis/trans diastereomers (1/3) around the amide bond can clearly be <lb/>observed in the NMR spectroscopic and LCMS analysis of (R)-2. <lb/>Methyl 2-[(1R)-1-{[2-amino-5-(3-{[bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]methyl}-<lb/>5-cyano-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl]oxy}ethyl]-4-fluorobenzoate <lb/>(R)-17. To a solution of methyl 2-{(1R)-1-[(2-amino-5-bromopyridin-3-yl)ox-<lb/>y]ethyl}-4-fluorobenzoate (R)-15 (0.3 g, 0.81 mol), di-tert-butyl [(4-bromo-5-<lb/>cyano-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)methyl]imidodicarbonate 16 (505 mg, <lb/>1.22 mmol) and B 2 Pin 2 (620 g, 2.44 mmol) in methanol (60 ml) was added <lb/>cataCXium A (40 mg, 0.1057 mmol) and Pd(OAc) 2 (25 mg, 0.1057 mmol). The <lb/>reaction mixture was degassed three times with N 2 gas and an aqueous solution of <lb/>NaOH (12 ml, 0.14 M) was added to the mixture under a blanket of N 2 gas. The <lb/>resulting mixture was again degassed with N 2 gas three times prior to being heated <lb/>to reflux for 16 h and the reaction was monitored by TLC (petroleum ether/EtOAc <lb/>3:1). Upon completion of the reaction, the resulting mixture was extracted with <lb/>EtOAc (3 Â 50 ml), and the combined organic layers washed with brine <lb/>(2 Â 30 ml), dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated in vacuo to afford a residue, <lb/>which was purified via column chromatography on silica gel eluting with <lb/>petroleum ether/EtOAc (from 10:1 to 5:1) to give methyl 2-[(1R)-1-{[2-amino-5-<lb/>(3-{[bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]methyl}-5-cyano-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl) <lb/>pyridine-3-yl]oxy}ethyl]-4-fluorobenzoate (R)-17 (340 mg, 52%) as a brown solid. <lb/>LCMS (APCI) m/z 647.1 [M þ Na] þ . <lb/>Methyl 2-[(1R)-1-({2-amino-5-[3-(aminomethyl)-5-cyano-1-methyl-1H-pyr-<lb/>azol-4-yl]pyridin-3-yl}oxy)ethyl]-4-fluorobenzoate (R)-18. To a stirred <lb/>solution of (R)-17 (340 mg, 0.42 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (2 ml) was added in a dropwise <lb/>manner at room temperature hydrogen chloride (4 M in dioxane, 10 ml).

One-step radio-<lb/>synthesis of [ 11 C]lorlatinib. Following the &apos;loop method&apos; on a GE Tracerlab FX FN <lb/>radiofluorination module was cleaned and the HPLC loop cleaned and dried <lb/>according to standard methods. Briefly, the methyl iodide delivery line and HPLC <lb/>loop were washed with 10 ml of water, 10 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of acetone. The <lb/>methyl iodide delivery line was reattached to the GE FX M module and helium <lb/>purged through the system for 20 min to ensure that the HPLC loop was dried. <lb/>One milligram of the unprotected precursor (R)-2 was dissolved in 100 ml of a <lb/>solution prepared from 12 ml of 1 M TBAOH in methanol dissolved in 1 ml of <lb/>anhydrous DMF. Eighty millilitre of this solution was transferred to the HPLC loop <lb/>just prior to the release of the activity from the cyclotron. A concentration of 0.7 <lb/>equivalents of the TBAOH base was used to allow for only the partial removal of <lb/>the amide proton and to insure that no other acidic protons should be removed. <lb/>11 CO 2 (800 mCi) was converted to 11 CH 3 I using the GE FX M (gas-phase methyl <lb/>iodide production module) and the carbon-11-labelled methyl iodide formed <lb/>(B365 mCi) was transferred to the HPLC loop in 4 min with a slow stream of <lb/>helium. Then, the 11 CH 3 I was allowed to react on the loop for a further 5 min. <lb/>Semi-prep purification of the crude material is shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. <lb/>This trace shows that it is not possible to separate the product [ 11 C](R)-1 from the <lb/>starting precursor (R)-2. <lb/>Two-step radiosynthesis of [ 11 C]1. 1 mg of the diBOC-protected precursor (R)-3 <lb/>was dissolved in 100 ml of a solution prepared from 12 ml of 1 M TBAOH dissolved <lb/>in 1 ml of anhydrous DMF. A volume of 80 ml of this solution was transferred to the <lb/>HPLC loop just prior to the release of the activity from the cyclotron. 11 CO 2 <lb/>(1,270 mCi) was converted to 11 CH 3 I and the methyl iodide formed (B620 mCi) <lb/>was transferred to the HPLC loop in 4 min with a slow stream of helium. Then, the <lb/>methyl iodide was allowed to react on the loop for a further 5 min. The crude <lb/>reaction mixture was purified by semi-prep HPLC 60:40 Acetonitrile: 0.1 M <lb/>ammonium formate, 5 ml min À 1 , Phenomenex Luna C18, 10 mm, 10 Â 250 mm. <lb/>The labelled protected intermediate was collected at B16 min and the collection <lb/>was restricted to only 1 min to allow the pH in the subsequent hydrolysis step to be <lb/>reproducible. The collected peak was transferred to the reaction vessel through the <lb/>Red path (see Supplementary Fig. 13). The line between Valve 18 and the collection <lb/>bulb was cut, and a male and female leur connection was placed there, allowing <lb/>easy conversion between the standard set-up and the set-up for the two-step <lb/>carbon-11-labelling reaction. <lb/>Prior to collecting the methylated intermediate, valves 13, 24 and 25 were <lb/>energized and valve 11 was de-energized, once V18 was energized, 1 min of the <lb/>peak was collected. Since the concentration and volume of the acid to be used in <lb/>the hydrolysis are fixed (0.7 ml of 6 M HCl), only 5 ml of the HPLC solvent <lb/>containing 0.1 M ammonium formate may be collected. If a larger amount is <lb/>collected (1.5 min), then there was a significant amount of the protected material <lb/>observed in the final product. A typical semi-prep HPLC trace is shown in <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 14. <lb/>The hydrolysis was performed at 80 °C for 5 min, and then the reaction mixture <lb/>was transferred back to the collection bulb. The bulb was preloaded with sodium <lb/>hydroxide (4.5 ml, 1 M), sodium acetate (6 ml, 3 M) and water (6 ml).

			<body>neutralization of the reaction mixture and thus the trapping of the desired product <lb/>on the HLB Light Sep-Pak cartridge. The cartridge was then washed with sterile <lb/>water for irrigation (10 ml) to remove any remaining salts and acetonitrile. The <lb/>product was eluted from the SPE cartridge with ethanol (1 ml, USP, 200 proof) and <lb/>diluted with sterile saline (9 ml, 0.9% solution). <lb/>Analysis of the HLB Sep-Pak indicated that 499% of the radioactivity was <lb/>trapped on the cartridge. The trapped radioactive material was eluted with ethanol <lb/>(1 ml) followed by elution with saline (9 ml, 0.9%). Final analysis of the HLB <lb/>Sep-Pak indicated that o0.01% of the radioactivity remained on the cartridge. <lb/>Quality control of the final product is shown in Supplementary Fig. 15. <lb/>[ 18 F]Fluoride production. A GE PETtrace 16.5 MeV cyclotron was used <lb/>for [ 18 F]fluoride production by the 18 O(p,n) 18 F nuclear reaction to irradiate <lb/>18 O-enriched water. A GE high-yield niobium target containing 497% enriched <lb/>O-18 water (Isotec, Taiyo Nippon Sanso or Rotem) was bombarded with protons at <lb/>integrated currents up to 65 mA to produce [ 18 F]fluoride. [ 18 F]Fluoride was <lb/>delivered to a lead-shielded hot cell in 18 O-enriched water by nitrogen gas pressure. <lb/>[ 18 F]Fluoride was prepared for radiofluorination as follows: a solution of base (for <lb/>example, tetraethylammonium bicarbonate, 3 mg) in acetonitrile and water (1 ml, <lb/>v/v 7:3) was added to an aliquot of target water (r1 ml) containing the appropriate <lb/>amount of [ 18 F]fluoride in a V-shaped glass vial sealed with a teflon-lined septum. <lb/>The vial was heated to 110 °C while nitrogen gas was passed through a P 2 O 5 -<lb/>Drierite column followed by the vented vial. When no liquid was visible in the vial, <lb/>it was removed from heat, anhydrous acetonitrile (1 ml) was added and the heating <lb/>was resumed until dryness. This azeotropic drying step was repeated an additional <lb/>three times. The vial was then cooled at room temperature under nitrogen pressure. <lb/>Manual synthesis of [ 18 F](R)-1 via (R)-5. Manual radiolabelling with tetraethyl <lb/>ammonium [ 18 F]fluoride ([ 18 F] TEAF) was carried out following standard labelling <lb/>procedures using precursor (R)-5 (3-4 mg) in DMSO and heated at 215 °C for <lb/>15 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were measured by radioTLC and showed <lb/>no significant yield of the desired product. Subsequent analysis of the reaction <lb/>mixture by radioHPLC indicated that o0.1% of the [ 18 F](R)-1 was being <lb/>produced. <lb/>Microfluidic synthesis of [ 18 F]1 via (R)-4. It has been well documented that the <lb/>use of microfluidic technology may lead to increased radiochemical conversion for <lb/>reactions with challenging substrates, where there is loss of material due to <lb/>decreased incorporation, degradation or inability to use high temperatures on a <lb/>conventional system. To this end, radiosynthesis of (R)-1 was repeated and the <lb/>reaction parameters optimized using a commercial microfluidic system and <lb/>following the optimization procedure. The radiosynthesis was then attempted using <lb/>the Discovery mode of the Advion NanoTek microfluidic system 38 , and the <lb/>optimal conditions were determined to be B14 mg ml À 1 (3 mg) of the nitro <lb/>precursor (R)-4 in DMSO (200 ml), a 100 mm Â 2 m reactor at a temperature of <lb/>220 °C, with a flow rate of 40 ml min À 1 . To ensure complete deprotection of all <lb/>labelled materials, the product was hydrolysed using 1 ml of ethanolic HCl, at <lb/>100 °C for 3 min; however, complete HPLC separation of the nitro precursor from <lb/>the final product proved to be problematic. <lb/>However, despite these efforts, the isolated yield of this reaction was only just <lb/>over 1%. Efforts to improve the RCY by carrying out the reaction under less basic <lb/>conditions by using tetrabutylammonium sulfate in lieu of tetraethylammonium <lb/>carbonate yielded similar results and we focused our attention on preparing (R)-13 <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 10). <lb/>Manual labelling [ 18 F]1 via iodonium ylide (R)-13. Precursor (R)-13 (2 mg) was <lb/>dissolved in DMF (400 ml) and added to a V-vial containing azeotropically dried <lb/>[ 18 F]Et 4 NF (typically 2-4 mCi). The reaction was heated at 80 °C for 10 min. The <lb/>reaction mixture was cooled for 3 min and then HCl was added (4 M, 1 ml) and the <lb/>reaction heated at 80 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room <lb/>temperature and neutralized to pH 5 with the addition of a mixture of NaOH (5 M, <lb/>0.8 ml) and NaOAc (3 M, 0.2 ml). The resulting mixture was further diluted with <lb/>water (16 ml) and passed through a Waters C18 Sep-Pak, which had been activated <lb/>by flushing sequentially with ethanol (1 ml) and water (5 ml). The Sep-Pak was <lb/>flushed with water (2 ml) and the desired product was eluted with ethanol (1 ml). <lb/>Product identity and purity were determined by radioHPLC (30:70 CH 3 CN:H 2 O <lb/>þ 0.1 N ammonium formate, Waters X-Bridge phenyl column) and radioTLC <lb/>(EtOAc þ 5% EtOH; Supplementary Fig. 19). The product was 485% <lb/>radiochemically pure. RCY was determined as the percentage of radioactivity that <lb/>was isolated as the final product from the amount of activity present in the V-vial <lb/>before the addition of (R)-13 to dried [ 18 F]Et 4 NF, and is not decay-corrected. <lb/>Using SPE only for the purification of the final product, [ 18 F]lorlatinib (R)-1 is not <lb/>sufficient to purify the radiotracer as there is a radiochemical by-product that is not <lb/>removed during the C18-SPE purification, as well as a number of cold impurities as <lb/>evidenced by the ultraviolet HPLC trace. <lb/>Purification of (R)-8 on the GE TracerLab FX FN . Precursor (R)-13 (2 mg) was <lb/>dissolved in DMF (400 ml) and added to a V-vial containing azeotropically dried <lb/>[ 18 F]Et 4 NF (24.7 mCi). The reaction was heated at 80 °C for 10 min. The reaction <lb/>mixture was cooled at 0 °C for 1 min and then diluted with water (2 ml). The crude <lb/>reaction mixture (19 mCi) was placed into RV2 of FX FN synthesis module and <lb/>manually loaded onto HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex Luna C18 5 u <lb/>Semi-Prep column that was previously equilibrated with 60:40 MeCN/0.1 M <lb/>ammonium formate. The desired compound eluted B17 min at 5 ml min À 1 HPLC <lb/>flow and was collected in a bulk vessel with water (25 ml). The contents of the bulk <lb/>vessel were passed through a C18-SPE cartridge that has been previously installed <lb/>on the FX FN module. The SPE cartridge was washed with water (10 ml) and taken <lb/>off line. The total activity on Sep-Pak ¼ 4.64 mCi. A volume of 1 ml of EtOH was <lb/>used to elute product into a clean V-vial À 4.64 mCi, RCY ¼ 19% non-decay-<lb/>corrected. To the contents of the v-vial was added HCl (4 M, 1 ml) and the reaction <lb/>heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and <lb/>neutralized to pH 5 with the addition of a mixture of NaOH (5 M, 0.8 ml) and <lb/>NaOAc (3 M, 0.5 ml). The contents of the vial was loaded onto a prepared HLB <lb/>cartridge (3.55 mCi) and [ 18 F]Lorlatinib (R)-1 was eluted with EtOH (1 ml) <lb/>À 3.36 mCi in a RCY of 14% (non-decay corrected). Radiochemical <lb/>purity ¼ 497%; specific activity ¼ 101 mCi mmol À 1 . <lb/>Automation of [ 18 F]lorlatinib. After all reagents and materials were installed on <lb/>the GE TracerLab FX FN , the [ 18 F]fluoride, 7 mCi, was transferred to the GE <lb/>TracerLab FX FN and the automated sequence was initiated. After completing the <lb/>HPLC purification of intermediate (R)-8, the compound was eluted from the <lb/>Sep-Pak using 1 ml of ethanol into a clean V-vial À 3.5 mCi. To the contents of the <lb/>V-vial was added HCl (4 M, 1 ml) and the reaction heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The <lb/>reaction was cooled to room temperature and neutralized to pH 5 with the addition <lb/>of a mixture of NaOH (5 M, 0.8 ml) and NaOAc (3 M, 0.5 ml). The contents of <lb/>the vial were loaded onto a prepared HLB cartridge (3.55 mCi) and [ 18 F]lorlatinib <lb/>(R)-1 was eluted with EtOH (1 ml) to give 1.22 mCi at 84 min of [ 18 F]lorlatinib (R)-<lb/>1, which was 497% radiochemically pure. <lb/>Animal husbandry. All animal experiments for both rodents and NHPs were <lb/>conducted in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee <lb/>(IACUC) guidelines and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. <lb/>PET image acquisition. All experiments were performed in compliance with the <lb/>procedures authorized by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at <lb/>Massachusetts. Studies were performed on two adult male rhesus macaques <lb/>(B10 kg body weight). Animals were sedated with ketamine (10 mg kg À 1 , <lb/>intramuscularly) and transported from housing to the imaging suite where <lb/>anaesthesia was maintained by isoflurane (1-2% in 100% O 2 at 2 l min À 1 ). <lb/>A flexible catheter was placed in the saphenous vein for administration of <lb/>radiotracer and the animal was positioned in the bore of an ECAT EXACT HR þ <lb/>PET scanner. Transmission data were acquired for 210 s at each of six consecutive <lb/>bed positions, with location and overlap corresponding to those used for <lb/>subsequent emission data collection and with field of view covering the entire head <lb/>and spanning down approximately to the knees. Approximately 4.5 mCi of <lb/>[ 11 C]lorlatinib prepared at high specific activity was infused intravenously over 60 s <lb/>followed by flush with sterile saline. Collection of emission data was initiated <lb/>concurrent with the start of administration of radiotracer. The dynamic multibed <lb/>acquisition consisted of six bed positions (matching the transmission scan <lb/>described above) and 11 passes. Emission data were acquired in a three-<lb/>dimensional mode for 60 s at each bed position during the first eight passes and <lb/>180 s per bed position for the final three passes. Accounting for latencies during <lb/>transition between bed positions, the emission data were collected out to 128 min <lb/>with data acquisition starting at the follow times for the successive passes: 0, 8.5, 17, <lb/>25.5, 34, 42.5, 51, 59.5, 68, 88.5 and 109 min after start of scan. PET images were <lb/>reconstructed on a grid with 2.57 mm voxels in plane and 2.43 mm slice thickness <lb/>using the manufacturer&apos;s implementation of the filtered backprojection algorithm <lb/>with corrections for photon scatter and attenuation, random coincidences, system <lb/>deadtime and detector inhomogeneity. PET radioactivity concentrations were <lb/>decay-corrected to the start of the scan and normalized by injected dose and subject <lb/>body weight to produce images in units of SUV. Images are shown below for each <lb/>animal, with data summed either prior to decay correction (displayed in units of <lb/>Bq/cc) or after decay correction (in SUV units). <lb/></body>
