By highlighting embodied perceptual-motor engagement with the <lb/>world, embodied cognitive learning emphasizes the importance of experience and perceptual-motor mechanisms in modulating the <lb/>development of person-environment systems. The field currently calls for research that combines such conceptual frameworks with <lb/>the complex everyday material and sociocultural landscapes that resource infants&apos; developmental trajectories. We, therefore, aim to <lb/>connect the conceptual refinement of bodily-anchored exploration to the contextual reality of everyday settings of early childhood <lb/>education (ECE)-here situated in the Brazilian context-as relevant social and cultural suppliers and modulators of the developmental <lb/>trajectories of babies. Secondarily, we ponder on the premises of national pedagogical curricula and their role in mediating the quality <lb/>of experiences and systems of person-environment relations more closely. Cultural-historical psychology, in dialogue with the <lb/>principles of Ecological Psychology, constitutes the theoretical framework that underpins the microgenetic analyses conducted. By <lb/>analyzing episodes of exploratory actions of a focal baby situated in the ECE context, we seek to apprehend motor-perceptual <lb/>indicators of embodied cognitive processing by considering the modes of appropriation entailed in episodes of embodied exploration. <lb/>We reflect on pedagogical implications considering official national documents of early childhood education. This work contributes <lb/>by providing complementary insights into the nature of infants&apos; everyday sociocultural embodied experiences and their development <lb/>in pedagogically oriented settings. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>babies, early childhood education, exploration, embodiment, cultural-historical <lb/>We turn our attention to an eight-month-old baby playing on the floor of an early childhood education (ECE) center. <lb/>Why is she there? What does she do in that space? Which objects does she play with? What is expected of this <lb/>baby in terms of development and learning? Analyzing processes of learning and appropriation entailed by educational <lb/>environments requires problematizing notions that antagonize the (seemingly) private character of individual cognitive <lb/>processes to (seemingly) collective material conditions of development. The current state of institutional pedagogical <lb/>services for infants goes beyond providing a place to stay while families work, as it implicates ensuring the right of the <lb/>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons <lb/>Attribution 4.0 International License, CC BY 4.0, which permits unrestricted use, <lb/>distribution, and reproduction, provided the original work is properly cited. <lb/></front>

			<body>child to be in that space, to be cared for, to be educated, and to develop. The shared responsibility among educators, the <lb/>school community, families, and the state converges on the need to be aware of the implications of decisions related to <lb/>policy, practice, and institutional provision that impact the construction of many childhoods. <lb/>The Distinctiveness of Early Childhood <lb/>Early childhood is characterized as a period of prolonged motor and neurological immaturity and rapid learning <lb/>(Tamis-LeMonda &amp; Rodriguez, 2008). Due to high brain plasticity, the first three years of life account for the most <lb/>prominent transformations in neurological development. Within this period of prolonged immaturity, survival can only <lb/>be ensured by the solidarity, care, and social complementarity of the other, which the baby activates via a potent <lb/>expressive and perceptual apparatus that allows intimate connection with the other and multimodal engagement with <lb/>the world (Almeida, 2014; Wallon, 1959). All of this takes place in complex cultural and social environments that are <lb/>the feeding sources of the development of the so-called higher psychological functions, such as thinking, memory, and <lb/>language (Vygotsky, 1995). Such functions cater to the semiotic substance of cultural practices that are propagated <lb/>across generations within the human realm of the world. <lb/>The combination of the above-mentioned elements accounts for early human learning and development as a highly <lb/>complex period. The condition of early immaturity is disputed as a legitimate asset in relation to psychological develop <lb/>ment (Pino, 2005). As culture influences, enhances, and integrates itself to biological development (Bussab &amp; Ribeiro, <lb/>1998), this allows the flourishment and transformation of a vast, flexible, and sophisticated repertoire of development <lb/>and learning that is unparalleled to any other period of human life. <lb/>Contributions From Cultural-Historical Psychology to Systemic and Ecological Thinking <lb/>Across various schools of thought, the field of Psychology has long grappled with dualistic divisions of human phenom <lb/>ena, such as the separation of nature and culture, the individual and the environment, and the mind and the body <lb/>(Dennett, 1991; Gallagher, 2013; Maturana &amp; Varela, 2001; Vygotsky, 2018; Wallon, 1959). The advocacy for overcoming <lb/>such dichotomy is emphasized throughout the works of Lev Semionovich Vygotsky. The concept of &quot;unity&quot; recurs in <lb/>various texts (Vygotsky, 1984, 2004, 2018) as an important basis for understanding the psyche as an integrated system of <lb/>functions that interrelates the body, emotions, intellect, and cognition (Sawaia &amp; Silva, 2015). Del Río and Álvarez (2007) <lb/>underline that: <lb/>Vygotsky&apos;s work could be considered as a bridge that connects the human organism to its medium, <lb/>the mind to the body. It rests on the ecological, biofunctionalist and sociogenetic theories of his age, <lb/>seeking within them the means of breaching the frontiers established by Cartesian thought. (p. 282) <lb/>Vygotsky&apos;s appeal to a multidisciplinary study of the human condition (biopsychosocial-cultural) encompasses choices <lb/>of words that are used to demarcate what is not only a linguistic position but also an epistemological one <lb/>(Meshcheryakov, 2010). Terms such as &quot;systems, &quot; &quot;unities, &quot; &quot;complex functions, &quot; &quot;experiences, &quot; and &quot;environment&quot; can <lb/>be understood as resources that the author employed to concretize/condense/exemplify the materiality of overcom <lb/>ing dichotomies and attending to integrity in the study of human development. Seeking to overcome reductionist <lb/>methods, Vygotsky paved pioneering paths for the study of human development during his time and asserted the <lb/>dialectical alliance between the biological, social, cultural, and historical dimensions of development. Building up on <lb/>cultural-historical premises, in this paper we also engage with contemporary frameworks dedicated to the intricate <lb/>subject-environment relationship, due to their updated conceptual and empirical refinement regarding early bodily <lb/>development and environmental apprehension, which we now turn to. <lb/>The Corporeal Turn and the Role of Early Motor and Perceptual Development in the <lb/>Paradigm of Embodied Cognition <lb/>More recent scholarly development has underscored the nature of one&apos;s awareness of and relation to the environment <lb/>in the new light of the so-called corporeal turn (Español, 2018). Such a paradigm poses that engagement with oneself, <lb/>others, and the environment can only take place through an embodied subject, which is found nested within a partic <lb/></body>

			<body>ular enabling organism/environment system (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017; Amorim, 2011). As scholars have embraced <lb/>a systemic comprehension of human development according to ecological and bodily constraints, the unity of the <lb/>person-environment has been enriched by a greater consideration of both the corporeal dimension and the role of <lb/>movement in advertising the nature of the psychological engagement of infants with the world (Español, 2018; Overton, <lb/>2008). This has led the status of motor development to be renovated in the field of Psychology by adding layers of <lb/>complexity to the study of motor acquisition (Thelen, 1995). <lb/>Inspired by the ecological and body/mind alliance under systemic frameworks, research employing the paradigm of <lb/>embodied cognition have further examined (Berger et al., 2021; Thelen, 2000) how interdependent mechanisms across <lb/>locomotor onset and multiple developmental domains (such as the cognitive, social, emotional, and neurological) are <lb/>related and affect development (Campos et al., 2000). Empirical findings have suggested that the process of locomotor <lb/>acquisition entails a family of experiences that demand, enable, and elevate the use of more complex psychological <lb/>functions, such as gestural communication, perception of self-motion, strategies of spatial coding and search, among <lb/>others (Campos et al., 2000; Mulder et al., 2017). <lb/>Such a synergy between contemporary research and further conceptual elaboration has strengthened the argument <lb/>that cognition is an embodied phenomenon. Being deeply grounded on the body, the integration of motor and sensorial <lb/>systems modulates the awareness, engagement and learning that one can have with the world (Adolph &amp; Franchak, <lb/>2017; Mulder et al., 2017; Thelen, 2000). As a result, it is argued that the combination of factors that compose complex <lb/>psychological processes, found both in distant abstraction and here-and-now cognition, is always intricated in a bodily <lb/>matrix (Berger et al., 2021; Del Río, 2002; Español, 2018; Thelen, 2000). This means that cognition caters to a larger range <lb/>of everyday experiences that require and produce cognitive processing as a process distributed across the body (Thelen, <lb/>2000) and that the role of perception and action throughout motor development are key modulators in the integration of <lb/>person/environment dynamics (Gibson, 1988; Thelen, 1995). <lb/>A pertinent theoretical framework within this paradigm originates from the scholarly contributions of James Gibson <lb/>and Eleanor Gibson (Gibson, 1966, 1979; Gibson, 1988). Such a framework suggests that infants are deeply attuned <lb/>and pursuant to environmental information through embodied mobile exploration that nests itself intimately within <lb/>the dynamics of their sensorial systems. Exploration generates perceptual information related both to their own <lb/>bodies as well as the environment that is codetermined by materialized action through surveillance and detection of <lb/>environmental information, which has been conceptualized as the action-perception coupling (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017; <lb/>Gibson, 1966, 1988). <lb/>Under such terms, the conceptual complexity of motor exploration is heightened. According to Adolph and Franchak <lb/>(2017), the development of action systems related to facial action (head movement and facial expressions), manual <lb/>action, posture, and locomotion are highly significant to the psychological and bodily supply that infants are equipped <lb/>with to perceive, plan and control interactions with their surroundings The dynamic interplay among such factors <lb/>enriches the perception of opportunities for what children come to learn and do. The perception of the relationality <lb/>between the organism and the environment according to the gathering and actualization of organism-environment <lb/>information relates to the concept of affordance (Gibson, 1979). Affordance refers to the recognition of body/environ <lb/>mental information whereby unique environmental arrangements are perceived as inviting and enabling or prohibiting <lb/>and disabling to a particular combination of bodily actions that might require adjustments between the organism and <lb/>the environment, which operate in mutual constitution (Gibson, 1979). In this sense, exploration is a vital process for <lb/>the generation of relevant environmental information for action (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017; Gibson, 1988). Exploration <lb/>enables perceptual learning by activating perception-action cycles which disclose affordances and allow thereby the <lb/>antecipation of requirements and assessment of outcomes of specific action. <lb/>Rationale and Aim <lb/>Given the centrality of systems of relations between the individual and the environment, advancing the study of <lb/>processes of exploration and embodied manifestations of cognitive processing requires social, cultural, and temporal <lb/>delimitation of the everyday contexts in which early development is rooted. In the everyday of ECE, objects are intro <lb/>duced, directly or indirectly to children with pedagogical purpose. Learning about and with the materiality of objects <lb/></body>

			<body>and physical furnishings implies apprehending embodied ways of acting upon them, the cultural meanings attributed by <lb/>the cultural group, as well as the potential for action constructed in the intricate relationship between the subject and <lb/>the object. Thus, there is the need to address the cultural inscriptions of ecological humanity embedded in the physical <lb/>and semiotic mediums of pedagogical materiality (Costall, 1995; Pedersen &amp; Bang, 2016; Tomasello, 1999). How do they <lb/>both invite and are met with children&apos;s attention and action? Hence, the social genesis of development, the symbolic <lb/>materiality of technical and semiotic tools, and the inseparability between the subject and the environment serve <lb/>as paradigms for understanding learning through mastering one&apos;s own conduct as a form of subjective constitution <lb/>(Vygotsky, 2018). <lb/>Therefore, by combining and applying both frameworks of cultural-historical psychology and embodied cognition, <lb/>this paper aims to investigate how processes of exploration entail indicators of motor-perceptual development and how <lb/>such process integrates itself into how the baby experiences their bodily engagement with the contextual materiality of <lb/>ECE. We recognize children&apos;s movement within their environment as the unit of experience of both lived and produced <lb/>relations with others and objects. <lb/>The research reported in this paper is situated in the Brazilian context. We start by briefly presenting current <lb/>Brazilian educational policies (National Curricular Guidelines for Early Childhood Education-DCNEI and the Common <lb/>National Curricular Base for Early Childhood Education-BNCC-EI). We then proceed to microgenetic analysis of <lb/>processual change of the motor development and exploration of a baby according to her ways of apprehending and <lb/>relating to the materiality of the ECE environment. We finalize by discussing the role of the pedagogical orientation <lb/>of conditions for the care and education within ECE across the first years of life (Amorim &amp; Rossetti-Ferreira, 1999; <lb/>Gobbato &amp; Barbosa, 2017). <lb/>Method <lb/>The Brazilian Context of ECE <lb/>Acknowledged as a right of the child, an obligation of the state and an option of families, the segment of early childhood <lb/>education in Brazil (Brasil, 1996, 1998) covers the age group from 0 to 5 years of age. Having interaction and play <lb/>as its structuring axes, pedagogical practice promotes education and care as inseparable dimensions embedded in the <lb/>everyday moments of pedagogically oriented environments. <lb/>Among changes in contemporary regulatory documents and policies of ECE that have impacted the work with <lb/>the youngest children, we highlight the homologation of the &quot;National Curricular Guidelines for Early Childhood <lb/>Education&quot; (DCNEI) (Brasil, 2010) and its incorporation into the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) (Brasil, <lb/>2018). These curricular guidelines entail a pedagogical orientation focused not on learning outcomes but, instead, on <lb/>the recognition of pertinent enabling competences associated with early development. As a proposal for curricular <lb/>organization, the advancement of skills and abilities is posited as inherent rights within the realms of learning and <lb/>development (Barbosa &amp; Fernandes, 2020). <lb/>According to these documents (Brasil, 2010, 2018) learning rights refer to the possibilities for children and their <lb/>others to live together, play, participate, explore, express, interact and learn from each other. Such rights are made <lb/>possible through the organization of so-called fields of experience, namely &quot;The I, the other and us&quot;; &quot;Body, gestures and <lb/>movements&quot;; &quot;Strokes, sounds, colors, and shapes&quot;; &quot;Listening, speaking, thinking and imagining&quot;; and &quot;Spaces, times, <lb/>quantities, relationships and transformations&quot;. <lb/>The fields of experience resort to the pedagogical responsibility of educators providing and promoting enriched <lb/>opportunities for babies to engage with multiple languages, ways of knowing and everyday practices. Exploration <lb/>is outlined as a right of learning and development of the baby and &quot;body, gesture and movement&quot; composes one <lb/>category of the fields of experiences that educators must attend to (Brasil, 2018). This perspective opens up interesting <lb/>possibilities for the interpretation of the daycare experience, prompting us to consider what occurs in babies&apos; developing <lb/>bodies and how this affects their engagement with objects, routines and environments within these spaces. <lb/>Therefore, having described underlying premises of the ECE context in Brazilian, we now turn to our theoretical-<lb/>methodological framework. <lb/></body>

			<body>Theoretical-Methodological Framework <lb/>The theoretical-methodological conception of this investigation is based on historical and dialectical materialism, which <lb/>also supports cultural-historical psychology. This assumption asserts that the object of study is not predetermined and <lb/>defined a priori; instead, both the object and the methodology are constructed dynamically throughout the research <lb/>process (Vygotsky, 1995). As Vygotsky (1995) states, the study should not &quot;start from the object and move to its parts, <lb/>but from the process to its isolated moments&quot; (Vygotsky, 1995, p. 66). Therefore, the conversion should be from the <lb/>&quot;object to process, &quot; which involves the study of the movement of ideas, the historical and cultural conditions, and the <lb/>potentialities and limitations of subjective interpretation. <lb/>In analyzing pedagogical and social stances, the general genetic law of cultural development (Vygotsky, 1995) may <lb/>or may not be realized. This law states that higher psychological functions always emerge twice: first in the collective <lb/>plane of social relations (called interpsychic) and then in the individual plane (called intrapsychic) (Vygotsky, 1995, <lb/>2018). In the &quot;unit&quot; of an experience in educational institutions, we can identify how toys/objects, spaces, and social <lb/>relationships mutually contribute to the possibility or lack thereof of cognitive development, i.e., the development of <lb/>attention, perception, memory, language, logical reasoning, imagination, and affection. It is considered a premise that <lb/>the environment influences a child&apos;s development in different ways at different stages of life, and at the same time, the <lb/>child modifies themselves, changing their subjective constitution and, therefore, changing their relationship with the <lb/>environment (Vygotsky, 2018). <lb/>Hence, the research methodology outlined here considers the context formed by policies that ensure the possibility <lb/>of pedagogical practices. The choice of this methodological approach aligns with what Álvarez (1994) previously men <lb/>tioned when stating that historically, research has focused on microanalyses and dyadic interactions while neglecting <lb/>broader aspects that constitute the entire relationship. As a result, &quot;The relevance both of the global systems and the <lb/>historical changes in these systems for the study of psychological processes have been neglected, and consequently, a <lb/>methodology accounting for this relevance has been ignored&quot; (Álvarez, 1994, p. 29). Therefore, according to Del Río and <lb/>colleagues (Del Río &amp; Álvarez, 2007; Del Río et al., 2022), the analytical proposal considers both micro-events (focused <lb/>on meaningful gestures in interaction) and macro-events (focused on objects and social practices). <lb/>Empirical Material and Context <lb/>We present three episodes of exploration involving a focal case study of an initially 8-month-old baby whom we refer <lb/>to as Sofia. The episodes are part of a doctoral research conducted by the first author of this paper (Costa, 2021) which <lb/>resorts to episodes originated from video recordings of the project&apos;s database (Costa, 2021). The research was approved <lb/>by a local Research Ethics Committee in Brazil (CAAE 1 68655317.9.0000.5407) and had the parents&apos; authorization for <lb/>image display for academic purposes. The ECE center in question was located in a medium-sized city in Brazil. The <lb/>temporal selection for this paper pertains to changes observed over the course of one month, capturing the transition <lb/>from assisted sitting to initial autonomous crawling. <lb/>Procedure of Analysis <lb/>The episodes of exploration were analyzed based on the cultural historical principles of microgenesis (Lavelli et al., <lb/>2005; Moreno-Núñez et al., 2017; Wertsch, 1985), which is an interpretation aimed at understanding the processes of <lb/>appropriation considering the novelty, and the potential of experience and the dialectics of development (Vygotsky, <lb/>2018). Microgenesis entails a thematic selection of the phenomenon of interest and detailed monitoring of the minutiae <lb/>of the actions of the focal subjects across the temporal course of transformation and development of the events (Góes, <lb/>2000; Rossetti-Ferreira et al., 2008). It recomposes a micro-story of the developmental trajectory by pondering the condi <lb/>tions in which the transformations take place. Focus is given to the interdependence and synergy among contextual <lb/>conditions, interactions, modes of expression, and different actions taking place across the connection of different <lb/>temporal events as something that relates to wider spheres of semiotic, cultural, and historical dimensions (Góes, <lb/>1) Certificates of Ethical Appraisal Submission <lb/></body>

			<body>2000; Rossetti-Ferreira et al., 2008). Taking the individual and the environment as an inseparable unity, the experience <lb/>apprehended in microgenetic analysis integrates action-cognition-emotion processes and manifests the refraction of the <lb/>person-environment unity through the particularities of the situation being experienced (Del Río et al., 2022; Vygotsky, <lb/>1995, 2018). In terms of refining this interpretation, the challenge of identifying how this process of understanding or <lb/>learning occurs in infants still requires the study of the biopsychosocial mechanisms involved. <lb/>The thematic selection of episodes (Rossetti-Ferreira et al., 2008) has employed the concepts of exploration (Gibson, <lb/>1988) and affordances (Gibson, 1979) viewed in situations of potential motor challenges for the baby. Exploration was <lb/>defined as the motor-perceptual investment, particularly made visible through the use of visual and haptic strategies <lb/>(Adolph et al., 2019), engendered in situations in which the baby displayed a differential investment towards an <lb/>apparent challenge or focus of interest. Affordances were hinted in the analytical work by apparently prominent percep <lb/>tion-action couplings that entailed interrelated adjustment of the action of the baby in face of the motor challenge. <lb/>The orchestration of both exploration and affordances are here assumed as indicators of manifestations of embodied <lb/>cognition (Thelen, 2000). Such concepts help us elucidate how the baby perceives the environment (sounds, textures, <lb/>weights, contours, etc.) while simultaneously creating meanings about themselves within that environment. Hence, the <lb/>analysis also draws attention to the inevitably implicated process of subjective constitution. <lb/>We shall now turn to the presentation of the empirical material. The three microgenetic episodes are presented in <lb/>chronological order and articulated in discussion with pertaining issues of the frameworks of cultural historical psychol <lb/>ogy and embodied cognition. Following the episodes, considerations are made regarding implications for pedagogical <lb/>practice. <lb/>Findings and Discussion <lb/>The microgenetic process of the focal baby starts at the sitting posture. The postural base provides an axial organization <lb/>for motor action (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017). It is essential for aligning the head and trunk and affects how babies <lb/>distribute their body weight and liberate their extremities while moving or looking around (Adolph et al., 2019). As <lb/>infants learn to explore upright postures, like sitting and standing, one of their primary challenges is mastering balance <lb/>over a smaller physical base (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017). In one episode titled &quot;to grab or let go of the ball&quot; (Figure <lb/>1), we see an eight-month-old baby, Sofia, when she was becoming more experienced in sitting without back support. <lb/>Such a posture was found to have been a preferential form of positioning by the different teachers in this center. The <lb/>stimulation of upright posture can be attributed to cultural and socially negotiated meanings of corporeal practices <lb/>proposed by traditions of education that strive to legitimize development-promoting practices in ECE. In dialectical <lb/>tension, new cultural propositions confronting usual perceptual-sensory circuits, motor tonicity, and means of mobility <lb/>previously experienced by the baby here produce the zone of instability and potential of transformation that constitutes <lb/>the exploratory challenge (Amorim, 2011; Wallon, 1959). <lb/>Figure 1 <lb/>Illustration of the Episode &quot;To Grab or Let Go of the Ball&quot; <lb/>Note.

			<body>As a &quot;novice seater&quot;, in Sofia&apos;s experience, reaching for distal moving objects while seated was significantly challenging. <lb/>She experienced restricted amplitude of back-and-forth trunk inclination, struggled with reinstating balance when <lb/>changing her gravitational center. In this episode, her exploration was visible through the sustained gaze focus accom <lb/>panied by slowly raising up both arms, and the stretching out both legs while inclining the trunk forward. Such <lb/>exploration was deeply attuned to incidental movements of the ball. However, despite Sofia&apos;s prolonged interest and <lb/>exploratory investment, the environmental and bodily challenges were too much to overcome as the ball rolled far <lb/>ahead. The whole situation seemed to enable perceptual assessment that struggles with trunk inclination and unstable <lb/>balance did not afford sufficient bodily extension for reaching the now distant ball. Such a perception of (lack of) <lb/>affordances seemed to lead to an abandonment of the prior exploratory investment: Sofia leaned back in straight sitting, <lb/>looked around, and went on to manipulating her own pacifier, the only object at immediate reach. <lb/>The paradigm of embodied cognition proposes that across the development of new motor skills, the baby needs <lb/>to constantly deal with trade-offs between attention and behavior according to tasks or perceptual information that <lb/>prevails across the perception-action couplings (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017; Berger et al., 2021). High investment in <lb/>adjusting restrictions to balance and postural control at the cost of the pace of exploration, as described in the episode, <lb/>is an example of these prepotent trade-offs (Berger et al., 2021). Such dynamics are suggested to impose an embodied <lb/>cognitive load that requires the baby to actively canalize more persistent and specialized adjustments of their actions <lb/>implicated with the exploratory challenge (Berger et al., 2021). However, it is not always the case that the baby is <lb/>successful. In fact, errors, struggles and conflicting situations are productive virtues of the process (Adolph &amp; Tamis-<lb/>LeMonda, 2014). As the baby has the opportunity to resort to new attempts across events that reinstate themselves daily, <lb/>the baby becomes more experienced and skilled by learning to regulate oneself and master the prepotent task. (Berger <lb/>et al., 2021). When this happens, the baby is then able to re-allocate attentional and bodily resources to other sources of <lb/>learning (Berger et al., 2021). We can observe such a description &quot;in action&quot; in a similar experience taking place a month <lb/>later. <lb/>In the episode &quot;pull to move&quot; (Figure 2), Sofia tackled the challenge of reaching yet another distal object, an occupied <lb/>baby (car) seat. The equipment was stabilized on the ground due to the weight of another baby inside. Sofia had now <lb/>developed more control, strength, and stability over the back-and-forth trunk plunging and initiated transitioning to <lb/>seated crawling (Adolph, 2008). In the scene, the focal baby explored the borders of the seat via focal and distal visual <lb/>alternation resourced by back-and-forth trunk inclination. When temporarily approaching the seat in deep plunging, <lb/>Sofia was able to visualize a swaddling quilt placed underneath the other baby hanging over the edges of the car <lb/>seat. Such an orchestration of her own bodily capacities in relation to the stable support entailed by this rather <lb/>unconventional set-up afforded the quilt to function as a sort of &quot;rope&quot;. In the wake of this creative affordance, Sofia <lb/>grabbed the blanket and, by gradual approximation, skillfully pulled herself closer to the car seat until she was close <lb/>enough to caress the little head of its patient occupant. <lb/>Figure 2 <lb/>Illustration of the Episode &quot;Pull to Move&quot; <lb/>Note. Source: Costa (2021). <lb/>This time, Sofia employed greater persistence towards reaching a target. She explored more creatively both her own <lb/>locomotor resources as well as intermediate sources of support. Such new forms of motor action can enable features <lb/></body>

			<body>perceived both in the baby&apos;s bodily matrix and the spatial set-up that come in intricate connection across an exploratory <lb/>flow that engenders cognitive skills such as active attentional focus, means-end problem solving, spatial locations and <lb/>tool use (Adolph &amp; Franchak, 2017; Campos et al., 2000). In light of the historical construction of the microgenetic <lb/>process, picking up on elements of structure, significance and dynamicity of the context helps us understand that such <lb/>change is meaningful to Sofia&apos;s development (Amorim, 2011; Del Río, 2002). The focal baby experiences a differentiated <lb/>possibility to explore the space. She makes use of her own perceptual-motor capacities and embodies roles and <lb/>itineraries of action that open up new possibilities of skills and affordances. Experiencing one&apos;s own body and physical <lb/>elements of the space with greater dexterity enhances pervasively the exploratory flow and transforms dialectically <lb/>the relationship within the body/environment system that social and culturally feed and (re)signifies developmental <lb/>trajectories. <lb/>This renders the exploratory process a new lease of life, which we also see in the episode &quot;take and turn the wagon&quot;, <lb/>taking place on the same day (Figure 3). After displaying conspicuous visual focus and bodily projection (Pedrosa &amp; <lb/>Carvalho, 2005) towards a wagon toy, Sofia approached it via active locomotion (seated crawling). When in possession <lb/>of the toy, the baby explored multiple affordances in relation to the wagon in skillful and diversified ways. She tumbled <lb/>the object over, hit the wheels, causing it to spin repeatedly, reached inside, taps the lateral border rhythmically, lifted <lb/>it up with her feet, and held it up with both arms while rotating her whole body. Actions such as object rotation, <lb/>high variability of hand (and feet) movement and orientation to functional features (e.g., spinning the wheel) and use <lb/>of whole-body exploration are indicators of a more complex apprehension and engagement with the world. Following <lb/>this prolonged bout of exploration with this single object, she put the wagon down and changed her attentional <lb/>focus. Henceforth, in contrast to what we have observed initially, the exploration came full circle as Sofia was able to <lb/>take initiative regarding the selection, start, development and conclusion of this exploratory episode showing greater <lb/>appropriation of her actions in relation to her foci of interest. <lb/>Figure 3 <lb/>Illustration of the Episode &quot;Take and Turn the Wagon&quot; <lb/>Note. Source: Costa (2021). <lb/>As depicted in our findings and posited by cultural-historical psychology, the role, and the meaning of the environment <lb/>vary according to the nature of the relation established between interacting factors at a given moment of their develop <lb/>ment (Pino, 2010; Vygotsky, 2018). The constitution of such relative parameters of development regards the historical <lb/>process through which human semiotic heritage becomes significant to culture, and culture becomes significant to <lb/>the child by means of the mediation of cultural processes (Pino, 2010; Rossetti-Ferreira et al., 2009; Vygotsky, 2018). <lb/>Mediated action entails the introduction of cultural tools that provoke tensions between sociocultural provision and the <lb/>concreteness of unique events that function in mutual interdependence which dialectically transform apprehension of <lb/>culturally relevant bodily/environmental information that supply the formation higher psychological functions (Del Río, <lb/>2002; Valsiner, 1997; Wertsch, 1994). <lb/>Overcoming the immediacy of the senses, mediated action can perpetrate even basic motor-perceptual mechanisms <lb/>that are gradually complexified. Mediational means furnish the semiotic texture of person/environment systems of <lb/></body>

			<body>development conveyed by cultural, interactive, and instrumental resources that substantiate children&apos;s recurrent en <lb/>counters with the world and the ontogeny of higher psychological functions (Del Río, 2002). As both a functional and <lb/>phenomenological embodied materialization of such process (Amorim, 2011), the subtle transformation of motor action <lb/>hints at trails of prior itineraries of internalization that have led to the construction of bodily mastery (re)composing <lb/>what can be metaphorically described as &quot;motor biographies&quot; of cognitive processing. (Del Río, 2002; Wallon, 1968). <lb/>Hence, recapitulating the history of Sofia&apos;s developmental trajectory of exploration on account of embodied cogni <lb/>tion, the episodes depict the focal baby developing a different relation with the exploratory phenomenon itself, that is, <lb/>anchored at a state of body/environment dynamic unity that affords greater mastery in taking the initiative and diver <lb/>sifying actions creatively. Throughout this microgenetic process, we see how exploration is processual and gradually <lb/>integrated to greater body control, sharper perceptiveness, and unconventional action with objects. This dialectically <lb/>engenders a transformed relation of the baby with the phenomenon of embodied exploration-here exemplified via <lb/>nuances of trunk inclination, reaching and manual manipulation-as a developmental trajectory that has transitioned <lb/>from hindered capacity to inaugurated possibilities of expanded motor-perceptual ways of being and acting in/with the <lb/>world. <lb/>Based on the discussions presented so far, we draw to a close of this paper by suggesting pedagogical implications <lb/>according to the premise of the fields of experience and the rights of learning and development. <lb/>Final Considerations <lb/>Early childhood education has undisputed historical importance in bolstering within the societal realm the notion that <lb/>children, and even babies, are historical, competent, and active subjects. Even seemingly small exploratory episodes of <lb/>babies in safeguarded educational settings represent the concretization of sociohistorical transformations (Campos et al., <lb/>2001; Kuhlmann, 2015). Children are now conceived as persons deserving of rights, care, education and socialization in <lb/>spaces of pedagogical quality ensured by political commitment (Brasil, 2010; Rossetti-Ferreira et al., 2009). Yet, babies are <lb/>still much less visible in policy, professional development, and practice, thus urging the pedagogical work to meet the <lb/>need of tailoring spaces, curricula, and educational guidance accordingly (Gobbato &amp; Barbosa, 2017). <lb/>To effectively support babies&apos; exploration, intentional pedagogical planning must be considerate of their diverse <lb/>and complex manifestations of ways of learning and being in the world. These develop through the diversification <lb/>of afforded actions, materials and physical spaces implicated in the pedagogical provision of time-spaces across the <lb/>institutional every day that enrich constitutive processes of subjectivity and body awareness of the baby, both of <lb/>oneself and others. The findings indicate the variability, flexibility and originality of creative solutions and exploratory <lb/>investment that babies engage themselves so avidly with. According to the processes hereby discussed, voluntary <lb/>motor-perceptual attention emerges as higher psychological functions through mediational means encapsulated in the <lb/>dialectics of embodied relations between the person and environment (Amorim, 2011; Del Río, 2002; Vygotsky, 2018; <lb/>Wertsch, 1994). Therefore, the access to more complex forms of cognitive functioning requires articulation between the <lb/>values and heritage of culture (Brasil, 2018), also carved into the materiality of toys, artifacts, objects that are made <lb/>available according to the regulating direction derived from official documents and policy. Pedagogical intentionality <lb/>provides thereof attentional direction to the meaning and the functions of objects, things, practices, and interactive <lb/>arrangements as means of enlarging cultural references of the child. It also affects children&apos;s apprehension of their ways <lb/>of knowing according to discovered interests, preferences, and curiosity about themselves and others (Oliveira et al., <lb/>2020). <lb/>Henceforth, the environment of exploration is materialized through the curative work of pedagogical intentionality <lb/>coupled with how teachers, spaces, objects, and interactive practices allow (or not) certain forms of bodily engagement. <lb/>Such mediational means act as transformative forces in the amplitude of experiences (Wertsch, 1994) that later converge <lb/>to &quot;... the development of thought and generalization&quot; in the child (Vygotsky, 2018, p. 83). In this sense, we posit that the <lb/>curricular matrix of ECE operates as an important consolidator of the cultural environment that pertains to the integral <lb/>development of the child, even pertaining to perceptual-motor exploratory processes of embodied cognitive learning. <lb/></body>
