			<other>tissue expansion, and staged surgery were all considered <lb/>and discounted at the patient&apos;s request. <lb/>

			With the patient remaining in a supine position throughout <lb/>surgery, the left mastectomy with skin excision was per-<lb/>formed. Planning in reverse, a fasciocutaneous flap from the <lb/>contralateral breast based on the right 2nd internal mam-<lb/>mary artery perforator was designed. The flap was raised in <lb/>the mastectomy plane, isolated on the perforator, and trans-<lb/>posed into the defect in a propeller fashion. The sternal skin <lb/>bridge was excised to avoid tunnelling the flap. The donor <lb/>site closed directly, no drains were used. As planned, the <lb/>patient was discharged home on post-operative day 1, with <lb/>only 1 dressing change required in clinic at 2 weeks. <lb/>Excision margins were clear of tumor, and both the flap <lb/>and donor site healed without complication. The patient is <lb/>happy and remains free of local recurrence at 4 months. <lb/>Disclosure/Financial support: None of the <lb/>authors has a financial interest in any of the products, <lb/>devices, or drugs mentioned in this manuscript. <lb/></other>

			<front>Why the P-Value Alone is Not Enough: <lb/>The Impact of Reporting Confidence <lb/>Intervals in the Plastic Surgery Literature <lb/>Mona T. Al-Taha, MD Candidate, BBA; <lb/>Osama A.

			<body>PURPOSE: The p-value is one of the most utilized descrip-<lb/>tors in statistical analysis; however, when reported in isola-<lb/>tion, it does not convey the effect size of a treatment. 1,2 The <lb/>reporting of confidence intervals is an essential adjunct to <lb/>determine the clinical value of a treatment, as it permits an <lb/>assessment of the effect size. 1,3 The objective of this study <lb/>was to assess the reporting of confidence intervals in clini-<lb/>cal trials within the plastic surgery literature. <lb/>METHODS: The seven highest impact plastic surgery <lb/>journals of different domains were screened using MED-<lb/>LINE for clinical trials in the years 2006, 2009, 2012, and <lb/>2015. Studies were randomized based on a predetermined <lb/>sample size. Various characteristics including the Jadad <lb/>quality score, statistical significance of the study findings, <lb/>year of publication, journal impact factor, and participation <lb/>of a methodologist were documented and their influence on <lb/>the use of confidence intervals was examined. <lb/>RESULTS: Two independent reviewers analyzed 135 <lb/>articles. There was substantial inter-rater agreement <lb/>(kappa=0.78). Although, 86% of the studies reported a <lb/>p-value, only 27% reported the confidence intervals. The <lb/>quality of the studies had a median Jadad score of 2 out of <lb/>5 (IQR 0-3.75). Bivariate analysis revealed that a higher <lb/>Jadad score (p=0.023) and inclusion of a research meth-<lb/>odologist (p=0.002) were associated with the reporting of <lb/>confidence intervals. Multivariate analysis revealed similar <lb/>findings, while journal impact factor, year of publication <lb/>and statistical significance were not correlated with confi-<lb/>dence interval reporting. <lb/>CONCLUSION: Confidence intervals are under-reported <lb/>in the plastic surgery literature. The main reason for report-<lb/>ing confidence intervals is that they focus on effect size and <lb/>statistical significance of results, whereas p-values do not <lb/>reveal all the information needed to interpret study findings. <lb/>To improve the reporting quality of clinical trials, results <lb/>should always include the confidence intervals to avoid the <lb/>misinterpretation of the effect size of a statistically signifi-<lb/>cant result. <lb/></body>
