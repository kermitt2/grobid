Activation of the <lb/>GLP-1 receptor potentiates the synthesis and release of insulin <lb/>from pancreatic -cells in a glucose-dependent manner. The <lb/>GLP-1 receptor belongs to class B of the G-protein-coupled recep-<lb/>tors, a subfamily characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular <lb/>ligand binding domain. Exendin-4 and GLP-1 are 50% identical, <lb/>and exendin-4 is a full agonist with similar affinity and potency for <lb/>the GLP-1 receptor. We recently solved the crystal structure of the <lb/>GLP-1 receptor extracellular domain in complex with the compet-<lb/>itive antagonist exendin-4(9 -39). Interestingly, the isolated extra-<lb/>cellular domain binds exendin-4 with much higher affinity than the <lb/>endogenous agonist GLP-1. Here, we have solved the crystal struc-<lb/>ture of the extracellular domain in complex with GLP-1 to 2.1 A ˚ <lb/>resolution. The structure shows that important hydrophobic <lb/>ligand-receptor interactions are conserved in agonist-and antago-<lb/>nist-bound forms of the extracellular domain, but certain residues <lb/>in the ligand-binding site adopt a GLP-1-specific conformation. <lb/>GLP-1 is a kinked but continuous -helix from Thr 13 to Val 33 when <lb/>bound to the extracellular domain. We supplemented the crystal <lb/>structure with site-directed mutagenesis to link the structural <lb/>information of the isolated extracellular domain with the bind-<lb/>ing properties of the full-length receptor. The data support the <lb/>existence of differences in the binding modes of GLP-1 and <lb/>exendin-4 on the full-length GLP-1 receptor. <lb/></front>

			<body>GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a peptide hormone pro-<lb/>duced by post-translational processing of proglucagon in the <lb/>intestinal L-cells (1). GLP-1 is an incretin that potentiates the <lb/>synthesis and release of insulin from pancreatic -cells in a <lb/>glucose-dependent manner (2) and has a number of other ben-<lb/>eficial effects that contribute to reducing blood sugar (3-6). In <lb/>addition, GLP-1 has been shown to reduce body weight (3, 5, 7), <lb/>which is favorable for many people with type 2 diabetes. Hence, <lb/>GLP-1-based therapies are becoming increasingly attractive for <lb/>the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The actions of GLP-1 are <lb/>mediated through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), 3 which is a <lb/>seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) <lb/>coupled to adenylyl cyclase (8). The human GLP-1R was first <lb/>cloned in 1992 and belongs to class B of GPCRs (9). This class <lb/>includes a wide range of receptors for peptide hormones like <lb/>glucagon, GLP-2 (glucagon-like peptide-2), glucose-<lb/>dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), pituitary aden-<lb/>ylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), vasoactive <lb/>intestinal polypeptide, secretin, calcitonin, corticotrophin-<lb/>releasing factor, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (10). The <lb/>receptors are distinguished by their large extracellular <lb/>N-terminal domain (ECD), which is important for ligand <lb/>binding and selectivity (11, 12). The current binding model <lb/>suggests a two-domain mechanism where the C-terminal <lb/>part of the ligand binds the ECD and the N-terminal part of <lb/>the ligand binds the extracellular loops and transmembrane <lb/>-helices (TM domain), which leads to receptor activation <lb/>(reviewed in Ref. 13). <lb/>The first structure of an isolated ECD of a class B GPCR <lb/>was solved recently by NMR spectroscopy (14). Subse-<lb/>quently, structures of ligand-bound ECDs were solved, includ-<lb/>ing the ECD of the human type 1 corticotrophin-releasing fac-<lb/>tor receptor 1 (15), the human type 1 PACAP receptor (16), the <lb/>human GIP receptor (17), the human GLP-1R (18), and the <lb/>human type 1 PTH receptor (19). The ECDs of class B receptors <lb/>have a common structure, the secretin recognition fold, which <lb/>is stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds and five con-<lb/>served residues (Asp 67 , Trp 72 , Pro 86 , Gly 108 , and Trp 110 in GLP-<lb/>1R). The receptor-bound ligands are primarily in -helical con-<lb/></body>

			<body>formation, and the C-terminal part of the ligands binds the <lb/>ECD in agreement with the two-domain binding mechanism. <lb/>Several receptor models have been proposed for full-length <lb/>class B receptors (20 -23). However, the orientation of the ECD <lb/>relative to the TM domain is uncertain. <lb/>Exendin-4 is a 39-amino acid peptide, which was originally <lb/>isolated from the venom of the lizard Heloderma suspectum <lb/>(24). GLP-1 and exendin-4 are 50% identical, and exendin-4 is a <lb/>full agonist with similar affinity and potency for the full-length <lb/>GLP-1R (25). However, structure-activity studies have demon-<lb/>strated interesting differences between the binding modes of <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4. 1) The isolated ECD binds exendin-4 <lb/>with high affinity (IC 50 of 6 nM) and GLP-1 with low affinity <lb/>(IC 50 500 nM) (26, 27). 2) GLP-1 binding is more sensitive to <lb/>site-directed mutagenesis of the TM domain compared with <lb/>exendin-4 binding (28 -30). 3) GLP-1 is much more sensitive to <lb/>N-terminal truncation than exendin-4 (31). N-terminally trun-<lb/>cated exendin-4 variants maintain high affinity but are unable <lb/>to activate GLP-1R, i.e. competitive antagonist, whereas N-ter-<lb/>minal truncation of GLP-1 severely affects both binding and <lb/>activation (31). Clearly, the interaction between the N-terminal <lb/>part of GLP-1 and the TM domain is critical for binding and <lb/>activation of GLP-1R. <lb/>Exendin-4(9 -39) is a truncated form of exendin-4, and a <lb/>competitive antagonist that maintains high affinity for GLP-1R <lb/>through interactions with the ECD (IC 50 value of 6 nM for the <lb/>isolated ECD) (27, 32). We recently solved the crystal structure <lb/>of the GLP-1R ECD in complex with exendin-4(9 -39) (18). <lb/>Exendin-4(9 -39) is -helical in the ECD-bound conformation <lb/>except for the C-terminal segment, the so-called Trp cage (33, <lb/>34). In solution, the helical propensity of exendin-4 is higher <lb/>than that of GLP-1 (27, 33). Biophysical studies showed a pos-<lb/>itive correlation between -helical propensity in solution and <lb/>affinity for the GLP-1R ECD (27). Moreover, charged residues <lb/>of exendin-4 interact with the ECD in a manner not possible for <lb/>GLP-1 (18). Hence, the high affinity of exendin-4 for the ECD <lb/>may be a combination of high helical propensity in solution and <lb/>unique receptor interactions. <lb/>Here, we report the crystal structure of the GLP-1R ECD in <lb/>complex with its endogenous agonist GLP-1. We supple-<lb/>mented the crystal structure with site-directed mutagenesis to <lb/>link the structural information of the isolated ECD with the <lb/>binding properties of the full-length receptor. <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES <lb/>Protein and Peptide Preparation-The GLP-1R ECD was <lb/>prepared as described previously (27). Briefly, N-terminal His 6 -<lb/>tagged ECD was expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, <lb/>isolated as inclusion body protein, solubilized in guanidine-HCl <lb/>and dithiothreitol, dialyzed against guanidine-HCl to remove <lb/>the dithiothreitol, and refolded using L-Arg and a 1:5 molar <lb/>ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The refolded ECD <lb/>was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and <lb/>size exclusion chromatography in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 <lb/>M Na 2 SO 4 , 2% glycerol. The His 6 tag was removed by thrombin <lb/>cleavage. The purified GLP-1R ECD consisted of four amino <lb/>acids, Gly-Ser-His-Met, of the linker attached to the N-termi-<lb/>nus of ECD (Arg 24 -Tyr 145 ), M r 14,723 g/mol after removal of <lb/>the His 6 tag. Native GLP-1(7-37)-OH was synthesized as <lb/>described previously (12). <lb/>Purification and Crystallization of the GLP-1-bound Extra-<lb/>cellular Domain-The purified GLP-1R ECD was concentrated <lb/>to 1.2 mg/ml, mixed with 3-fold molar excess of GLP-1(7-37) <lb/>(dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and incubated overnight <lb/>at 4 °C. The GLP-1-bound ECD was purified by size exclusion <lb/>chromatography on a Superdex 75 column in 10 mM Tris-HCl, <lb/>pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and characterized by SDS-<lb/>PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). The complex was concentrated <lb/>to 4 mg/ml and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. <lb/>The crystallization conditions were initially identified using the <lb/>Crystal Screen from Hampton Research and subsequently opti-<lb/>mized to 0.1 M N(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.9, 14 <lb/>volume % ()-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 9 mM n-decyl--<lb/>D-thiomaltoside. Single crystals were flashed cooled in liquid N 2 <lb/>using 30% glycerol in the cryo solution. <lb/>Data Collection and Structure Determination-Diffraction <lb/>data were collected from a single crystal using beamline 1911-3 <lb/>at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden). The data were integrated and <lb/>scaled using XDS (35). The crystals belonged to space group <lb/>P2 1 22 1 with the unit cell dimensions a 35.7 Å, b 42.7 Å, and <lb/>c 95.1 Å. The phases and electron density map were obtained <lb/>by molecular replacement using Phaser running in the CCP4 <lb/>program interface with one complex in the asymmetric unit. <lb/>Refinement was done using COOT (36) and REFMAC5 (37). <lb/>Well defined electron density was obtained for GLP-1 residues <lb/>Thr 11 *-Val 33 * and for ECD residues Val 30 -Glu 128 . Poor den-<lb/>sity was observed for GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *, Lys 34 *, and Gly 35 * <lb/>and ECD residues Thr 29 and Asn 115 . No electron density was <lb/>observed for His 7 *-Glu 9 * and Arg 36 *-Gly 37 * of GLP-1. Our <lb/>final structure contains GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *-Gly 35 * and ECD <lb/>residues Thr 29 -Glu 128 , but it should be noted that the confor-<lb/>mation of Lys 34 * of GLP-1 is very uncertain, and because of the <lb/>poor density we have chosen to show Asn 115 as Gly. The final <lb/>GLP-1-bound ECD structure has 116 residues in preferred <lb/>regions, 5 in allowed regions and only 1 outlier (Glu 68 in the <lb/>-turn between 1 and 2 shown in Fig. 1A) in the Ramachan-<lb/>dran plot. The structure containing 73 water molecules and a <lb/>detergent molecule (n-decyl--D-thiomaltoside) has a working <lb/>R-factor of 0.181% and a free R-factor of 0.226%. Data collection <lb/>and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Coordi-<lb/>nates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data <lb/>Bank under accession code 3IOL. Molecular graphics were pre-<lb/>pared in PyMOL (46). <lb/>Receptor Constructs-The cDNA encoding the human GLP-<lb/>1R was originally obtained from Dr. B. Thorens (9) and sub-<lb/>cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/ <lb/>v5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The presence of the C-terminal <lb/>His 6 tag was previously shown not to influence the functional <lb/>response of the receptor (12). Site-directed mutagenesis of <lb/>GLP-1R was done using QuikChange TM (Stratagene). Plasmid <lb/>DNA was generated using the NucleoBond Xtra Maxi Plus kit <lb/>(Macherey-Nagel), and the desired mutations were confirmed <lb/>by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. <lb/>Cell Culture and Receptor Expression-Human embryonic <lb/>kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco&apos;s modified <lb/>Eagle&apos;s medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10 volume <lb/></body>

			<body>% fetal bovine serum and 1 volume % penicillin/streptomycin <lb/>(100 units/ml) in T175 flasks. HEK293 cells were transiently <lb/>transfected with 21 g of GLP-1R DNA using the FuGENE TM <lb/>transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), harvested <lb/>24 h after transfection, and used directly in functional exper-<lb/>iments or plasma membrane preparations as described pre-<lb/>viously (12). <lb/>Functional Assay-Transiently transfected HEK293 cells <lb/>expressing wild-type GLP-1R or mutant receptors were har-<lb/>vested and resuspended in assay buffer (Flashplate, <lb/>PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a cell density of 2.4 10 6 cells/ <lb/>ml. GLP-1(7-37)-acid and exendin-4 were diluted in phos-<lb/>phate-buffered saline with 0.02 volume % Tween 20. Cells in <lb/>assay buffer (50 l) and GLP-1 or exendin-4 (50 l) were mixed <lb/>in 96-well FlashPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), gently agi-<lb/>tated for 5 min, and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. <lb/>The resulting intracellular level of cAMP was measured accord-<lb/>ing to supplier&apos;s manual and analyzed by nonlinear regression/ <lb/>sigmoidal dose-response fitting using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad <lb/>Software, Inc.). <lb/>Receptor Binding Assay-Freshly <lb/>thawed plasma membrane prepara-<lb/>tions from transiently transfected <lb/>HEK293 cells expressing GLP-1R <lb/>(20 g protein/well) were pulled <lb/>through a 25-gauge needle three <lb/>times and diluted in assay buffer (50 <lb/>mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM <lb/>EGTA, 0.005 volume % Tween 20, <lb/>pH 7.4). GLP-1 and exendin-4 were <lb/>diluted in assay buffer. The concen-<lb/>tration range was 1 pM to 100 nM <lb/>for GLP-1 and exendin-4. 125 I-GLP-<lb/>1(7-36)-amide (2.2 Ci/mol) was <lb/>dissolved in assay buffer and added <lb/>at 50,000 cpm per well to a final <lb/>concentration of 50 pM. Nonspe-<lb/>cific binding was determined with <lb/>1 M GLP-1. Membrane prepara-<lb/>tion and radioligand were mixed in <lb/>96-well 0.65-m filter plates (Milli-<lb/>pore) with either diluted GLP-1 or <lb/>exendin-4 and incubated for 1 h at <lb/>37 °C. Subsequently, bound and <lb/>unbound radioligands were sepa-<lb/>rated by vacuum filtration (Milli-<lb/>pore vacuum manifold). The filters <lb/>were washed twice in 100 l of cold <lb/>assay buffer and left to dry. Data <lb/>were analyzed by nonlinear regres-<lb/>sion, and the expression level (B max ) <lb/>was calculated using Prism 5.0 <lb/>(GraphPad Software, Inc.). <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Purification, Crystallization, and <lb/>Structure Determination-The GLP-<lb/>1R ECD was expressed in E. coli <lb/>inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as described previously <lb/>(27). A complex of GLP-1 and the ECD was purified by size <lb/>exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The purified <lb/>complex was characterized by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. <lb/>S1), concentrated, and crystallized by hanging drop vapor dif-<lb/>fusion. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal <lb/>using the beamline 1911-3 at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden), and <lb/>the structure of GLP-1 in complex with the GLP-1R ECD was <lb/>solved to 2.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Fig. <lb/>1A). We removed exendin-4(9 -39) from the structure of the <lb/>exendin-4(9 -39)-ECD complex (Protein Data Bank code <lb/>3C59) and used the apo-form of GLP-1R ECD as the search <lb/>model for the molecular replacement. GLP-1 was then built <lb/>into the model; its position was unambiguous due to good elec-<lb/>tron density for most of the ligand. Data collection and refine-<lb/>ment statistics are summarized in Table 1. Throughout the text, <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4 residues are designated with * and **, <lb/>respectively. Exendin-4 is numbered 1-39 and GLP-1 is num-<lb/>bered 7-37, due to post-translational processing. The aligned <lb/>sequences are illustrated in Fig. 1B. <lb/>FIGURE 1.

			<body>Structure of the GLP-1R Extracellular Domain-The crystal <lb/>structure of the ECD in the GLP-1-bound form shown here is <lb/>very similar to the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound form shown previ-<lb/>ously (root mean square deviation of 0.79 Å for C atoms of the <lb/>ECD) (18). The ligand-binding sites are identical, which is not <lb/>surprising given the competitive binding of GLP-1 and <lb/>exendin-4 for the full-length GLP-1R as well as the isolated <lb/>ECD (27). However, we have previously shown that divergent <lb/>residues in the two ligands are responsible for their different <lb/>physical properties in solution and their different affinity for <lb/>the ECD (27). As described below, these divergent residues give <lb/>rise to structural differences in the two ligand-bound forms of <lb/>the ECD at the level of specific side chain conformations. <lb/>Structure of GLP-1 and Its Interactions with the Extracellular <lb/>Domain of GLP-1R-GLP-1 is a continuous -helix from <lb/>Thr 13 * to Val 33 *, with a kink around Gly 22 *. The residues <lb/>between Ala 24 * and Val 33 * interact with the ECD (Fig. 1, A and <lb/>B). The amphiphilic nature of this -helical segment enables <lb/>hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions through opposite <lb/>faces of the -helix. The hydrophilic face is comprised by resi-<lb/>dues Gln 23 *, Lys 26 *, Glu 27 *, and Lys 34 *. Lys 26 * is the only one of <lb/>these that may interact directly with the ECD (Fig. 2A). The side <lb/>chain of Lys 26 * may form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of <lb/>Glu 128 (3.0 Å), but the B-factor is rather high for both residues <lb/>(25 compared with 10 for well defined residues), suggesting <lb/>that this is not a strong interaction. In particular, the electron <lb/>density of the Lys 26 * side chain is rather weak. In exendin-4(9 -<lb/>39), the amphiphilic character is more pronounced, and the <lb/>-helical conformation is further stabilized by intramolecular <lb/>interactions between Glu 16 **, Glu 17 **, Arg 20 **, Glu 24 **, and <lb/>Lys 27 ** on the hydrophilic face (18). In addition, Arg 20 ** and <lb/>Lys 27 ** interact with Glu 128 and Glu 127 of the ECD, respectively <lb/>(18). The corresponding intramolecular stabilization is not pos-<lb/>sible in GLP-1 due to a less favorable alignment of oppositely <lb/>charged residues (Fig. 1B), and Glu 127 of the ECD is not <lb/>involved in binding of GLP-1 (Fig. 2A). <lb/>The hydrophobic face of GLP-1, which interacts with the <lb/>ECD, is defined by Ala 24 *, Ala 25 *, Phe 28 *, Ile 29 *, Leu 32 *, and <lb/>Val 33 * (Fig. 2B). The importance of Phe 28 *, Ile 29 *, and Leu 32 * in <lb/>GLP-1 binding has been demonstrated previously by Ala scan-<lb/>ning of GLP-1 (38). Substitution of Phe 28 * with Ala had the <lb/>most severe effect on GLP-1 affinity in the Ala scan (IC 50 value <lb/>increased by 1300-fold), and indeed Phe 28 * is centrally posi-<lb/>tioned in the ligand-receptor interface emphasizing the impor-<lb/>tance of this hydrophobic ligand-receptor interaction. The <lb/>I29*A and L32*A substitutions also reduced GLP-1 affinity sig-<lb/>nificantly (IC 50 value increased by 93-and 17-fold, respectively) <lb/>(38). Trp 31 * is also on the hydrophobic face of GLP-1 but is <lb/>rather solvent-exposed and does not interact with the ECD <lb/>(Fig. 2B). Trp 31 * is conserved in the <lb/>glucagon peptide family (GLP-1, <lb/>exendin-4, glucagon, GIP, and <lb/>GLP-2, see Fig. 1B), which implies a <lb/>unique role of this residue. How-<lb/>ever, substitution of Trp 31 * with Ala <lb/>only reduced the binding affinity of <lb/>GLP-1 slightly at the full-length <lb/>GLP-1R (38), so the role of Trp 31 * in <lb/>receptor binding is unclear. <lb/>Val 33 * is the final residue in the <lb/>-helix of GLP-1, and it is the final <lb/>residue in the C terminus of GLP-1 <lb/>that interacts with the ECD (Fig. 2, <lb/>A and C). The side chain of Val 33 * <lb/>makes hydrophobic contacts with <lb/>Tyr 69 and Leu 123 , and the backbone <lb/>carbonyl of Val 33 * interacts through <lb/>a hydrogen bond with one of the ter-<lb/>minal nitrogens of Arg 121 (Fig. 2, A <lb/>and C). The other terminal nitrogen <lb/>of Arg 121 interacts with a water mol-<lb/>FIGURE 2. Interactions between GLP-1 and GLP-1R ECD.

			<body>ecule, which is also coordinated by the backbone carbonyl <lb/>groups of Asp 67 and Leu 32 * (Fig. 2C). A water molecule is coor-<lb/>dinated by the same residues in the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound <lb/>ECD, and Arg 121 interacts with the backbone carbonyl of <lb/>Lys 27 ** of exendin-4(9 -39) in a manner similar to the interac-<lb/>tion with Val 33 * of GLP-1. Even though exendin-4 has a C-ter-<lb/>minal nine-residue extension, the so-called Trp cage, the extent <lb/>of the -helix is similar for GLP-1 and exendin-4, and this par-<lb/>ticular length of the -helix fits nicely into the ECD binding <lb/>pocket. <lb/>Judging from the two ligand-bound ECD structures, the <lb/>hydrophobic ligand-receptor interface is highly conserved, and <lb/>the C-terminal -helical structure of the ligands ends at the <lb/>same position with a similar arrangement of receptor interac-<lb/>tions mediated by the backbone of the ligand. Hence, the dif-<lb/>ferential affinity for the ECD may best be explained by the lower <lb/>-helical propensity of GLP-1 in solution and by weaker recep-<lb/>tor interactions compared with exendin-4, as suggested previ-<lb/>ously (27). <lb/>Unique Structural Features of the GLP-1-bound Extracellu-<lb/>lar Domain-The divergent residues in GLP-1 and exendin-4 <lb/>are not only responsible for the different physical properties <lb/>of the ligands in solution and their differential affinity for the <lb/>GLP-1R ECD, they also influence the conformation of certain <lb/>residues in the ECD structures. The crystal structure presented <lb/>here suggests that one diverging residue in the two ligands <lb/>(Val 33 * of GLP-1 and Lys 27 ** of exendin-4(9 -39)) causes a shift <lb/>in the conformations of four residues in (or close to) the binding <lb/>pocket of the ECD, namely Glu 127 , Leu 123 , Arg 121 , and Pro 119 <lb/>(Fig. 3A). In exendin-4(9 -39), Lys 27 ** interacts with Glu 127 , <lb/>and the positioning of the Lys 27 ** side chain appears to be <lb/>guided by a hydrophobic interaction with Leu 123 . In GLP-1, <lb/>Val 33 * is unable to interact with Glu 127 causing Glu 127 to <lb/>change rotamer conformation and point its side chain away <lb/>from GLP-1. The side chain of Leu 123 is flipped toward Arg 121 , <lb/>which again is flipped toward <lb/>Pro 119 , thereby closing an otherwise <lb/>water-accessible cavity observed in <lb/>the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound struc-<lb/>ture (Fig. 3A). The closing of this <lb/>cavity is assisted by a side chain flip <lb/>of Pro 119 toward Arg 121 . The appar-<lb/>ent GLP-1-specific conformations <lb/>affect the conserved core of the ECD <lb/>by rotating the guanidine group of <lb/>Arg 102 and by decreasing the dis-<lb/>tance between Asp 67 and Arg 102 <lb/>compared with the exendin-4(9 -<lb/>39)-bound structure without affect-<lb/>ing the relative position and confor-<lb/>mation of Trp 72 and Trp 110 (Fig. <lb/>3B). This enables a direct interac-<lb/>tion through a hydrogen bond <lb/>between Asp 67 and Arg 102 unlike <lb/>what we observed in the exendin-<lb/>4(9 -39)-bound structure, where a <lb/>water molecule mediated the inter-<lb/>action between Asp 67 and Arg 102 <lb/>(Fig. 3B). The functional consequences of the ligand-specific <lb/>conformational differences are not known. <lb/>Site-directed Mutagenesis of the GLP-1R-To link the struc-<lb/>tural information of the isolated ECD with the binding and <lb/>functional properties of the full-length receptor, we targeted <lb/>the ligand-binding site of the ECD by site-directed mutagene-<lb/>sis. The mutants were characterized by their ability to bind <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4, using the agonist 125 I-GLP-1 tracer, and <lb/>by their ability to stimulate cAMP production in response to <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4 (Table 2). The main objective was to <lb/>search for mutations with differential effect on GLP-1 and <lb/>exendin-4. We initially focused on Glu 127 , which showed an <lb/>obvious conformational difference in the two ligand-bound <lb/>structures (Fig. 3A), Glu 127 interacts directly with exendin-<lb/>4(9 -39) but not with GLP-1 (18). The ECD structures suggest <lb/>that the hydrogen-bonding potential of Glu 127 is important for <lb/>exendin-4 binding but not for binding of GLP-1, and this is <lb/>supported by the site-directed mutagenesis data (Table 2). <lb/>Mutation of Glu 127 to Ala reduced the affinity for exendin-4 but <lb/>not for GLP-1 (6.8-versus 1.7-fold, respectively). Glu 128 inter-<lb/>acts with a positively charged residue in both GLP-1 and <lb/>exendin-4, which may explain why the E128A substitution did <lb/>not have a differential effect on the binding affinity of GLP-1 <lb/>and exendin-4. The differential effect of the E127A mutation on <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4 binding is rather small compared with <lb/>the differential affinity of the isolated ECD shown previously <lb/>(27). Clearly, the superior helical propensity of exendin-4 con-<lb/>tributes strongly to its high affinity for the ECD. <lb/>Several interactions are conserved in the two ECD structures, <lb/>and mutagenesis of the implicated receptor residues was not <lb/>expected to have differential effects on ligand binding (Table 2). <lb/>Surprisingly, the L32A mutation reduced both the affinity <lb/>and potency of exendin-4 relative to GLP-1 (7.1-and 9.5-fold, <lb/>respectively, see Table 2 and Fig. 4), demonstrating a ligand-<lb/>specific effect of the L32A mutation. Neither the potency nor <lb/>FIGURE 3. Differences between the GLP-1-and exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure of ECD.

			<body>the affinity of GLP-1 was affected by the L32A mutation (Fig. 4), <lb/>and the expression level of the receptor was similar to wild-type <lb/>GLP-1R, which confirmed the structural integrity of this <lb/>receptor mutant. Leu 32 is the first <lb/>residue in the -helix of the GLP-1R <lb/>ECD, and it defines the border of <lb/>the hydrophobic binding cavity by <lb/>interacting with Ala 24 *, Ala 25 *, and <lb/>Phe 28 * (Fig. 2B). The results suggest <lb/>that Leu 32 is important for the bind-<lb/>ing of exendin-4 but not for the <lb/>binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R. It is <lb/>difficult to give a structural explana-<lb/>tion of the ligand-specific effect of <lb/>the L32A mutation by comparing <lb/>the two ligand-bound forms of the <lb/>ECD, because the structural differ-<lb/>ences in this region are quite subtle. <lb/>Nevertheless, the ligand-specific <lb/>effect of the L32A mutation sup-<lb/>ports the existence of differences in <lb/>the binding modes of GLP-1 and <lb/>exendin-4 to the full-length GLP-1R. <lb/>Clearly, the two-domain binding <lb/>mechanism of the full-length GLP-<lb/>1R is more complex than binding of <lb/>the isolated ECD. <lb/>Conformation of GLP-1, Recep-<lb/>tor-bound and in Solution-GLP-1 <lb/>is highly flexible in aqueous buffers, <lb/>whereas in trifluoroethanol a single-<lb/>stranded -helix forms (Thr 13 * to <lb/>Lys 34 *) with a less defined -helical <lb/>region around Gly 22 *, as demon-<lb/>strated by NMR spectroscopy (33, <lb/>39). Structure-activity studies of <lb/>GLP-1 showed that side chain to <lb/>side chain cyclization by lactam <lb/>bridge formation of residues 16 -20 <lb/>and 18 -22 were well tolerated.

			<body>terpart (40, 41). These data support the existence of an -helical <lb/>conformation in the N-terminal part of GLP-1 when bound to <lb/>the full-length GLP-1R. It is interesting that in the ECD-bound <lb/>structure, the Thr 13 *-Glu 21 * segment of GLP-1 adopts an <lb/>-helical conformation even though this segment does not <lb/>interact with the ECD. The C-terminal segment of GLP-1 <lb/>(Ala 24 *-Val 33 *) is stabilized in a specific -helical conformation <lb/>through binding to the ECD. This may subsequently stabilize an <lb/>-helical conformation in the N-terminal part of the ligand <lb/>(Thr 13 *-Glu 21 *). This hypothesis is supported by the solution <lb/>structure of GLP-1 in different concentrations of trifluoroetha-<lb/>nol (39). GLP-1 is a random coil in pure water, but adding tri-<lb/>fluoroethanol enables the C-terminal segment of GLP-1 to <lb/>adopt an -helix conformation. The C-terminal -helix is grad-<lb/>ually extended toward the N-terminus of the peptide with <lb/>increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (39), and it seems <lb/>possible that a similar mechanism is initiated upon binding of <lb/>GLP-1 to the ECD. It was recently proposed that -helix for-<lb/>mation of the ligand upon binding <lb/>to the ECD is an important step in <lb/>the activation of class B GPCRs (23). <lb/>As shown in Fig. 5A, the -helix <lb/>of GLP-1 has a central distortion of <lb/>the backbone around Gly 22 *, which <lb/>is not observed in the exendin-4(9 -<lb/>39)-bound structure. The distortion <lb/>is also observed in the NMR struc-<lb/>tures of GLP-1 in solution (39). <lb/>However, we cannot exclude that <lb/>the kink observed in the crystal <lb/>structure is a result of crystal pack-<lb/>ing between the N-terminal part of <lb/>GLP-1 (Gly 10 *-Glu 21 *) and symme-<lb/>try-related ECDs rather than a func-<lb/>tionally important characteristic of <lb/>GLP-1 (Fig. 5, B-D). Substitution of <lb/>Gly 22 * with Ala was previously shown <lb/>not to affect the functionality or the <lb/>binding affinity of GLP-1, which sug-<lb/>gests that flexibility around Gly 22 * is <lb/>not required for binding to or acti-<lb/>vation of GLP-1R (38). Interest-<lb/>ingly, Leu 32 of the ECD is positioned <lb/>right next to the kink of GLP-1 (Fig. <lb/>5A). Thus, we have demonstrated a <lb/>ligand-specific effect of the L32A <lb/>mutation and have shown that <lb/>ECD-bound GLP-1 has a kink right <lb/>next to Leu 32 , whereas ECD-bound <lb/>exendin-4(9 -39) is straight. This <lb/>may be a coincidence, but it is <lb/>tempting to speculate that there is a <lb/>connection between the structural <lb/>difference of the ligands (kinked or <lb/>straight helix) and the differential <lb/>effect of the L32A mutant on bind-<lb/>ing of the ligands. <lb/>A three-dimensional model of <lb/>GLP-1R was recently published (21). From the NMR structure <lb/>of GLP-1 in trifluoroethanol (Protein Data Bank code 1D0R <lb/>(39)), it was suggested that GLP-1 might assume one of two <lb/>forms when bound to GLP-1R, a slightly kinked -helix or an <lb/>L-shaped -helix, and the authors concluded that the L-shaped <lb/>-helix conformation of GLP-1 seemed more reasonable <lb/>(21). The crystal structure presented here is more compatible <lb/>with the kinked conformation of GLP-1. <lb/>The structure of His 7 *-Gly 10 * was not determined in this <lb/>study probably due to the inherent flexibility in this part of <lb/>GLP-1 and other peptide ligands for class B receptors (33, 39, <lb/>42, 43). The only structural evidence showing a unique confor-<lb/>mation comes from a structural study of PACAP(1-21) com-<lb/>paring micelle-and receptor-bound states. Residues 1-7 of <lb/>PACAP(1-21) adopt a specific -coil structure upon receptor <lb/>binding followed by an -helical structure of residues 8 -21 <lb/>(44). The relevance of the receptor-bound PACAP(1-21) struc-<lb/>ture for GLP-1 in particular is supported by a previous study of <lb/>FIGURE 5. Crystal packing. A, superposition of ECD-bound GLP-1 (blue) and exendin-4(9 -39) (cyan). GLP-1 <lb/>residue Gly 22 * denotes a kink in the -helix, which is situated in close proximity to Leu 32 of the ECD. B, crystal <lb/>packing involving symmetry-related complex molecules. C, ribbon diagram of GLP-1 (blue) and its interactions <lb/>with the ligand of a symmetry-related molecule. Residues Tyr 19 *, Gln 23 *, and Glu 27 * are shown as sticks, and the <lb/>surface of the GLP-1R ECD is shown in gray. The packing of complex molecules allows Tyr 19 * to interact with <lb/>Gln 23 * (3 Å) and Glu 27 * (2.5 Å) in a symmetry-related ligand molecule. D, interactions between GLP-1 and <lb/>residues of symmetry-related ECD molecules. GLP-1 residues Thr 11 * , Thr 13 *, Ser 14 *, and Glu 21 * are shown as <lb/>sticks. The backbone carbonyl of Thr 11 * could form a weak hydrogen bond (3.2 Å) to the backbone amide of <lb/>Gln 112 , the backbone amide of Thr 13 * could form a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) to the backbone carbonyl of Gln 112 , <lb/>and the backbone amide of Ser 14 * may form a hydrogen bond (3 Å) to the side chain of Asp 114 . The side chain <lb/>of Glu 21 * forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Phe 80 (2.6 Å). <lb/></body>

			<body>chimeric PACAP/GLP-1 peptides (45). Substituting five resi-<lb/>dues from the N-terminus of GLP-1 with those of PACAP (three <lb/>nonconserved, Fig. 1B) had no effect on either the affinity or <lb/>potency for GLP-1R. Thus, on the basis of both sequence <lb/>homology and structure-activity, GLP-1 would be expected to <lb/>adopt a similar conformation upon binding to the GLP-1R TM <lb/>domain. <lb/>Conclusion-The crystal structure presented here shows <lb/>the molecular details of GLP-1 binding to the GLP-1R ECD, <lb/>an essential step in the two-domain binding mechanism of <lb/>GLP-1R and class B GPCRs in general. Collectively, results <lb/>from structural characterization of GLP-1 in solution, struc-<lb/>ture-activity analyses of GLP-1 analogues, and the crystal struc-<lb/>ture of GLP-1 bound to the GLP-1R ECD presented here sug-<lb/>gest that GLP-1 is a continuous -helix from Thr 13 * to Val 33 * <lb/>when bound to the full-length GLP-1R. This is important infor-<lb/>mation for the design of peptide therapeutics targeting GLP-<lb/>1R. GLP-1 and exendin-4 share the same binding site of the <lb/>GLP-1R ECD, but the ligand-specific effects on the ECD struc-<lb/>ture and the ligand-specific effects of receptor mutagenesis <lb/>support the existence of differences in the binding modes of <lb/>GLP-1 and exendin-4 to the full-length GLP-1R. The nature of <lb/>these differences as well as the active conformation of peptide <lb/>agonists (kinked or not) and a better understanding of the two-<lb/>domain binding mechanism await structural characterization <lb/>of the full-length GLP-1R. <lb/></body>
