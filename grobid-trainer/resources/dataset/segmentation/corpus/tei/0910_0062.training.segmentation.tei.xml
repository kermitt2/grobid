Rolandi <lb/>PACS: <lb/>13.15.+g <lb/>13.85.Lg <lb/>14.60.Lm <lb/>Keywords: <lb/>Coherent pion neutrino neutral current <lb/>We present a study of exclusive neutral pion production in neutrino-nucleus Neutral Current interactions <lb/>using data from the NOMAD experiment at the CERN SPS. The data correspond to 1.44 × 10 6 muon-<lb/>neutrino Charged Current interactions in the energy range 2.5 <lb/>E ν <lb/>300 GeV. Neutrino events with <lb/> only one visible π 0 in the final state are expected to result from two Neutral Current processes: <lb/>coherent π 0 production, ν + A → ν + A + π 0 and single π 0 production in neutrino-nucleon scattering. <lb/>The signature of coherent π 0 production is an emergent π 0 almost collinear with the incident neutrino <lb/>while π 0 &apos;s produced in neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering have larger transverse momenta. In <lb/>this analysis all relevant backgrounds to the coherent π 0 production signal are measured using data <lb/>themselves. Having determined the backgrounds, and using the Rein-Sehgal model for the coherent π 0 <lb/>production to compute the detection efficiency, we obtain 4630 ± 522(stat) ± 426(syst) corrected <lb/>coherent-π 0 events with E π 0 <lb/>0.5 GeV. We measure σ (νA → νAπ 0 ) = [72.6 ± 8.1(stat) ± 6.9(syst)] × <lb/>10 −40 cm 2 /nucleus. This is the most precise measurement of the coherent π 0 production to date. <lb/>© 2009 Elsevier B.V. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Motivation <lb/>Precise measurement of π 0 production when a neutrino scat-<lb/>ters coherently off a target nucleus, ν + A → ν + A + π 0 , de-<lb/>picted in Fig. 1, is challenging: the cross-section (σ ) of coherent-<lb/>π 0 (Coh π 0 ) is 0.003 of the inclusive neutrino charged current <lb/>(CC) interactions at E ν <lb/>25 GeV [1]; the single π 0 is notori-<lb/>ously refractory to accurate identification in neutrino detectors. <lb/>Consequently the past cross-section measurements of Coh π 0 have <lb/>been poor, with a precision no better than <lb/>30% [2-6]; recently <lb/>the MiniBOONE experiment has reported the fraction of Coh π 0 <lb/>in all exclusive NC π 0 production [7]. This challenge is the pri-<lb/>mary motivation for the present analysis. The second motivation is <lb/>utilitarian. Since Coh π 0 is almost collinear with the incident neu-<lb/>trino, in massive neutrino detectors a Coh π 0 event will manifest <lb/>itself as a forward electromagnetic shower posing a background <lb/>for the ν e -induced signal. This is relevant to the long baseline <lb/>experiments searching for ν e appearance with the purpose of mea-<lb/>suring the mixing angle Θ 13 . A precise measurement of Coh π 0 , <lb/>although conducted at energies higher than those of the long base-<lb/>line projects at Fermilab (MINOS/NOνA), will constrain the error <lb/>on a model-prediction of this background to the ν e appearance. Fi-<lb/>nally, the study of coherent pion production provides an insight <lb/>into the structure of the weak hadronic current [1,8], and offers <lb/>a test of the partially conserved axial-vector current hypothesis <lb/>(PCAC) [9]. Ref. [10] presents an excellent review of these topics. <lb/>A coherent interaction, Fig. 1, where no charge or isospin is ex-<lb/>changed between the ν and the target nucleus (A) which recoils <lb/>without breakup, leads to an enhancement in the cross-section. In <lb/>the Coh π 0 process the interaction is mediated by a pomeron-like <lb/>particle bearing the quantum number of the vacuum. The cross-<lb/>section is dominated by the axial vector current. The contribution <lb/>of the isovector current to the Coh π 0 process is minimal where Z 0 <lb/>can be viewed as a ρ meson which produces a π 0 exchanging an <lb/>isoscalar ω with A. This minimal contribution of the isovector cur-<lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 1. Diagram of the Coh π 0 process, ν + A → ν + A + π 0 . <lb/>rent to the Coh π 0 arises from two reasons: (a) the cross-section <lb/>of the isovector ρ-A interaction is zero in the forward direction, <lb/>a direction preferred by the nuclear form factor; and (b) the vec-<lb/>tor component has a contribution proportional to (1 − 2 sin 2 θ W ) 2 <lb/>reducing the isovector contribution further, the net reduction with <lb/>respect to the axial part being a factor of 3.5. The PCAC hypoth-<lb/>esis stipulates that for zero-momentum transfer ( Q 2 = 0, where <lb/>Q 2 is the negative of the square of the four-momentum transfer <lb/>from the incident neutrino to the target), the ν-A cross-section <lb/>can be related to the π-A cross-section. The ν-A cross section in <lb/>the forward direction is related to the strong π-A interaction as <lb/>follows: <lb/>d 3 σ (νA → νAπ 0 ) <lb/>dx dy dt <lb/>Q 2 =0 <lb/>= <lb/>G 2 M E ν <lb/>π 2 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>f 2 <lb/>π (1 − y) <lb/>dσ (π A → πA) <lb/>dt <lb/>yE ν =E π <lb/>. <lb/>(1) <lb/>In Eq. (1) G is the Fermi coupling constant, M is the nucleon mass, <lb/>x = Q 2 /2Mν and y = ν/E ν , where ν is the energy of the hadronic <lb/>system in the final state, are the standard scaling variable, and <lb/>f π = 0.93m π is the pion decay constant. The variable t quantifies <lb/>the coherence (forwardness) and is defined as t = p 2 <lb/>T = (q − P π ) 2 , <lb/>i.e. the square of the four-momentum transfer to the nucleus. In <lb/>a neutral current (NC) event since the emergent neutrino remains <lb/>invisible, |t| cannot be measured. Instead the very small transverse <lb/>momentum expected in a coherent interaction can be quantified <lb/>using the variable ζ defined as: ζ π 0 = E π 0 [1 − cos(θ π 0 )]. This vari-<lb/>able has the property that its distribution depends weakly on the <lb/>incident neutrino energy. <lb/>For low but non-zero Q 2 values, the hadron dominance <lb/>model [11] provides a guide to extend the cross-section formula <lb/>Open access under CC BY license. <lb/></body>

Beam and detector <lb/>The Neutrino Oscillation MAgnetic Detector (NOMAD) exper-<lb/>iment at CERN used a neutrino beam [12] produced by the <lb/>450 GeV protons from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) inci-<lb/>dent on a beryllium target and producing secondary π ± , K ± , and <lb/>K 0 <lb/>L mesons. The positively charged mesons were focussed by two <lb/>magnetic horns into a 290 m long evacuated decay pipe. Decays <lb/>of π ± , K ± , and K 0 <lb/>L produced the SPS neutrino beam. The aver-<lb/>age neutrino flight path to NOMAD was 628 m, the detector being <lb/>836 m downstream of the Be-target. The SPS beamline and the <lb/>neutrino flux incident at NOMAD are described in [13]. The ν-flux <lb/>in NOMAD is constrained by the π ± and K ± production mea-<lb/>surements in proton-Be collision by the SPY experiment [14-16] <lb/>and by an earlier measurement conducted by Atherton et al. [17]. <lb/>The E ν -integrated relative composition of ν μ : νμ : ν e : νe CC <lb/>events, constrained in situ by the measurement of CC-interactions <lb/>of each of the neutrino species, is 1.00 : 0.025 : 0.015 : 0.0015. <lb/>Thus, 95% of ν-events are due to ν μ -interactions with a small νμ -<lb/>contamination. <lb/>The NOMAD experiment was designed to search for ν μ ; ν τ <lb/>oscillations at m 2 5 eV 2 , and in large m 2 range it set strin-<lb/>gent limit [18] on this search, along with the CHORUS experi-<lb/>ment [19]. The NOMAD apparatus [20] was composed of several <lb/>sub-detectors. The active target comprised 132 planes of 3 × 3 m 2 <lb/>drift chambers (DC) with an average density similar to that of liq-<lb/>uid hydrogen (0.1 gm/cm 3 ). On average, the equivalent material <lb/>in the DC encountered by particles produced in a ν-interaction <lb/>was about half a radiation length and a quarter of an hadronic <lb/>interaction length (λ). The fiducial mass of the NOMAD DC-target, <lb/>2.7 tons, was composed primarily of carbon (64%), oxygen (22%), <lb/>nitrogen (6%), and hydrogen (5%) yielding an effective atomic num-<lb/>ber, A = 12.8, similar to carbon. Downstream of the DC, there <lb/>were nine modules of transition radiation detectors (TRD), fol-<lb/>lowed by a preshower (PRS) and a lead-glass electromagnetic <lb/>calorimeter (ECAL). The ensemble of DC, TRD, and PRS/ECAL was <lb/>placed within a dipole magnet providing a 0.4 T magnetic field <lb/>orthogonal to the neutrino beam line. Two planes of scintillation <lb/>counters, T 1 and T 2 , positioned upstream and downstream of the <lb/>TRD, provided the trigger in combination with an anti-coincidence <lb/>signal, V , from the veto counter upstream and outside the magnet. <lb/>Downstream of the magnet was a hadron calorimeter, followed by <lb/>two muon-stations each comprising large area drift chambers and <lb/>separated by an iron filter placed at 8-and 13-λ&apos;s downstream of <lb/>the ECAL, that provided a clean identification of the muons. The <lb/>schematic of the detector in the Y -Z view is shown in Fig. 2. The <lb/>charged tracks in the DC were measured with an approximate mo-<lb/>mentum (p) resolution of σ p /p = 0.05/ <lb/>√ <lb/>L ⊕ 0.008p/ <lb/>√ <lb/>L 5 (p in <lb/>GeV/c and L in meters) with unambiguous charge separation in <lb/>the energy range of interest. The detailed individual reconstruc-<lb/>tion of each charged and neutral track and their precise momen-<lb/>tum vector measurement enabled a quantitative description of the <lb/>event kinematics: the strength and basis of NOMAD analyses. The <lb/>experiment recorded over 1.7 million neutrino interactions in its <lb/>active drift-chamber (DC) target. These data are unique in that <lb/>they constitute the largest high resolution neutrino data sample <lb/>with accurate identifications of ν μ , νμ , ν e , and νe charged current <lb/>interactions in the energy range O(1) E ν 300 GeV. In addi-<lb/>tion, the experiment recorded over 2 million ν-interactions in the <lb/>Al-coil and over 20 million in the Fe-scintillator calorimeter, both <lb/>upstream of the active-DC target. <lb/>3. The Coh π 0 signature and models <lb/>The signature for Coh π 0 is a single forward π 0 and nothing <lb/>else. The π 0 will promptly decay into two forward photons (γ ). <lb/>In massive neutrino detectors the signal will manifest itself as an <lb/>electromagnetic shower, short and compact, with a forward direc-<lb/>tion. The accompanying irreducible backgrounds will be ν e , νe , and <lb/>ν-NC events dominated by π 0 &apos;s. In NOMAD, however, the Coh π 0 <lb/>signal will reveal two distinct photons. The photons will either <lb/>both convert in the DC target, or one of the photons will convert in <lb/>the tracker and the other will be measured in the electromagnetic <lb/>calorimeter (ECAL), or both photons will be measured in the ECAL. <lb/>In this analysis we focus on the event sample where both photons <lb/>convert in the DC target. Fig. 2 shows such an event. The momenta <lb/></body>

			<body>of the associated e − and e + are measured in the magnetic field. <lb/>Each event thus provides a complete π 0 -momentum vector. We <lb/>use the Rein-Sehgal (RS) model [1] to simulate the Coh π 0 in-<lb/>teraction in the NOMAD detector. As a check we also simulated <lb/>the Coh π 0 interaction following the Belkov-Kopeliovich (BK) [8] <lb/>model. The π 0 reconstruction efficiency computed using the BK <lb/>model is similar to that determined by the RS model. <lb/>Recently a set of new Coh π 0 calculations has been proposed <lb/>(see [21,22] and [23]). They focus on Coh π 0 production in low-<lb/>energy neutrino interaction (O(1) GeV). However, the present <lb/>Coh π 0 measurement at an average E ν 25 GeV, more precise by <lb/>about a factor of three than currently available, could be used to <lb/>constrain parameters used in these calculations. <lb/>4. Selection of exclusive 2-γ events <lb/>We select events with two converted photons in the DC tar-<lb/>get. The analysis uses the entire NOMAD data and the associated <lb/>Monte Carlo (MC) samples as described in [24]. The number of <lb/>fully corrected ν μ -CC in the standard fiducial volume of NOMAD is <lb/>1.44 × 10 6 events: the denominator for the present measurement. <lb/>The NC-DIS sample, defined by requiring that the generated invari-<lb/>ant hadronic mass squared (W 2 ) be <lb/>1.96 GeV 2 , is normalized <lb/>to 0.53 × 10 6 events which corresponds to 0.37 of the ν μ -CC. The <lb/>NC-Resonance (W 2 <lb/>1.96) sample is set at 3.5% of the NC-DIS. <lb/>The MC sample specific to this analysis is the RS Coh π 0 simu-<lb/>lation. Motivated by the ν μ -induced coherent-π + cross-sections <lb/>presented in [8] and the fact that the NC/CC coherent pion cross-<lb/>section ratio should be (1/2), the Cohπ 0 sample is normalized <lb/>to 5000 events with generated E π 0 <lb/>0.5 GeV. The large sam-<lb/>ple of data and those of the NC and CC deep inelastic scattering <lb/>(DIS) MC events are subjected to a preselection. The preselection <lb/>includes the following requirements: (a) the presence of one con-<lb/>verted photon whose reconstructed conversion point is defined as <lb/>the event vertex ( X , Y , Z ); (b) no identified muons; (c) vertex <lb/>coordinates of the converted photon within the fiducial volume, <lb/>|X, (Y −5)| 130 cm and Z Min Z 405 cm where Z Min depends <lb/>upon the detector configuration (see [24] for detail); (d) the in-<lb/>variant mass (M ee ) of the e − and e + less than 100 MeV/c 2 which <lb/>selects both the converted photons -the upstream being γ 1, and <lb/>the downstream being γ 2, with 95% purity and 97% efficiency. The <lb/>preselection reduces the data and the NC-MC samples by a factor <lb/>of about a hundred. <lb/>The cuts for the final selection of the Coh π 0 events are set <lb/>to maximize the selection efficiency of two photon conversions <lb/>in the DC tracker. The cuts are optimized to reduce the NC-DIS <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Selection of exclusive 2-γ events in the MC samples: The MC samples have been <lb/>normalized as presented in Section 4. <lb/>Cut <lb/>Coh π 0 -R S <lb/>N C -D I S <lb/>N C -R e s <lb/>Raw <lb/>1435.4 <lb/>4743.2 <lb/>1132.8 <lb/>No μ-ID <lb/>1435.4 <lb/>4687.9 <lb/>1125.7 <lb/>γ 1 Fid-cuts <lb/>1373.0 <lb/>4682.3 <lb/>1 0 3 0 .4 <lb/>γ 1 M ee 50 MeV <lb/>917.5 <lb/>3664.9 <lb/>2 7 .2 <lb/>No upstream track <lb/>862.2 <lb/>1717.7 <lb/>2 3 .8 <lb/>No veto <lb/>858.4 <lb/>1659.5 <lb/>2 3 .7 <lb/>γ 2 Fid-cuts <lb/>128.9 <lb/>311.7 <lb/>1 .2 <lb/>γ 2 M ee 50 MeV <lb/>117.5 <lb/>236.7 <lb/>1 .1 <lb/>E π 0 <lb/>0.5 GeV <lb/>117.5 <lb/>236.7 <lb/>1 .1 <lb/>DCA-| X, (Y − 5)| 130 cm <lb/>115.9 <lb/>225.2 <lb/>1 .0 <lb/>DCA-Z <lb/>Z Min <lb/>112.6 <lb/>222.5 <lb/>1 .0 <lb/>DCA-Z <lb/>Z Min <lb/>3.3 <lb/>2 .7 <lb/>0 .0 <lb/>background while keeping the Coh π 0 signal high. We also look <lb/>at about 10% of the data to check the efficacy of cuts used in re-<lb/>ducing the background induced by ν-interactions occurring outside <lb/>the fiducial volume -the outside background (OBG). The remain-<lb/>ing data have no influence on the choice of the cuts. The results <lb/>presented here include the entire data sample. Among the gener-<lb/>ated Coh π 0 , only about 29% of events trigger the apparatus. The <lb/>loss arises from the non-converted photons ( 50%) and, among <lb/>the converted photons, from the e − /e + tracks that do not reach <lb/>the downstream trigger counters ( 20%). <lb/>The final event selection follows the preselection cuts with <lb/>more stringent requirement. The M ee cut is tightened to 50 MeV/c 2 <lb/>which increases the photon conversion purity to <lb/>98% while re-<lb/>ducing the efficiency to 93%. Two additional cuts are imposed to <lb/>reduce outside background by requiring that there be no tracks <lb/>upstream of the first photon conversion (γ 1) and that there be no <lb/>hits associated with the tracks composing the γ 1 in the most up-<lb/>stream DC. The second photon conversion, γ 2, occurs downstream. <lb/>The two reconstructed photon momentum vectors enable one to <lb/>determine the ν-interaction vertex by extrapolating the vectors <lb/>upstream and finding the coordinates of their distance of closest <lb/>approach (DCA). The procedure defines the DCA-vertex with co-<lb/>ordinates denoted as DCA-X , DCA-Y , and DCA-Z . The DCA-vertex <lb/>resolution is well understood using ordinary ν-interactions where <lb/>the primary charged tracks composing the event vertex are ignored <lb/>Fig. 3.

Therefore we have principally relied <lb/>upon angular variables to determine the signal. Table 1 summa-<lb/>rizes the selection of events in the MC samples. The reconstruction <lb/>efficiency of the Coh π 0 signal is 7.8% (the BK model yields 7.7%). <lb/>Table 1 also shows that the NC-Resonance production contributes <lb/>less than 1% to the sample. In the following the resonance contri-<lb/>bution is simply added to the NC-DIS component. The preselected <lb/>Fig. 5. Data and MC comparison of the P T γ γ distribution. <lb/>data are subjected to identical cuts. Having identified the two <lb/>photons, and having imposed the DCA-X/Y cuts, data can be com-<lb/>pared with the respective predictions as shown in Table 2. Note <lb/>that the fraction of events failing the DCA-Z cut is larger in data <lb/>than those in the Coh π 0 and NC-DIS simulations. This is due to <lb/>neutrinos interacting in material just outside the fiducial volume <lb/>cut such as the magnet, coil, etc., which are not simulated in the <lb/>MC. Some of these interactions will also produce events with DCA-<lb/>Z <lb/>Z Min . The measurement of this background and the calibration <lb/>of the NCDIS and Coh π 0 predictions are presented in the follow-<lb/>ing section. <lb/>5. Extraction of the Coh π 0 signal <lb/>The extraction of Coh π 0 signal is data driven. Monte Carlo <lb/>simulations can neither reliably provide the normalization of the <lb/>outside-background, nor the normalization of the NC-DIS induced <lb/>π 0 where nothing else is visible, nor the shape of the ζ variables. <lb/>Distinct control samples in the data provide a measure of these <lb/>backgrounds, including the integral and the shape of the variables <lb/>relevant to this analysis. <lb/>First we present the measurement of background induced by <lb/>ν-interactions outside the fiducial volume (OBG). As shown in Ta-<lb/>ble 1, the fraction of MC events in the fiducial region but with <lb/>DCA-Z <lb/>Z Min is negligible. The 169 data events that fail the DCA-<lb/>Z cut (see Table 2) are dominated by interactions upstream of <lb/>the detector ( Z <lb/>Z Min ); the contribution from the events entering <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 6. Data and MC comparison of the M γ γ distribution. <lb/>from the sides give a small contribution ( 2% of the background). <lb/>This is for two reasons: first, since the transverse resolution of <lb/>DCA-vertex is accurate to <lb/>±3 cm, the DCA-X and DCA-Y cuts <lb/>largely eliminate these events; second, among the events relevant <lb/>to the Coh π 0 selection the two photons travel along the beam <lb/>while particles entering the detector from the sides have much <lb/>larger angles. <lb/>The 169 events failing the DCA-Z cut (Table 2) are the key to <lb/>providing the normalization for the outside-background (OBG). To <lb/>determine the OBG a different data sample is selected in which a <lb/>vertex is reconstructed upstream of the detector ( Z <lb/>Z Min ). In this <lb/>control sample the primary tracks are then ignored and the events <lb/>are subjected to the Coh π 0 analysis. A total of 1378 events sur-<lb/>vive this selection of which 451 (927) events have the DCA vertex <lb/>within (outside) the fiducial volume. Fig. 3 compares the shape of <lb/>the Z -distribution of the DCA of the 169 events that fail the DCA <lb/>cut in the Coh π 0 signal sample with the 927 events that fail this <lb/>cut in the control sample. The shapes agree well. <lb/>We thus measure the normalized OBG prediction to be: <lb/>[451/927] × 169 = 82.2 ± 6.9 events. The distributions of the OBG <lb/>variables (vertex position, ζ , M γ γ , etc.) are measured using the <lb/>two-photon data with DCA-Z <lb/>Z Min normalized to 82.2 events. <lb/>Table 2 presents the calibrated OBG background. <lb/>Second, we present the measurement of the NC-DIS back-<lb/>ground. The NC-DIS component of the 2-γ sample is selected using <lb/>the kinematic variables. We use events with M π 0 0.2 GeV/c 2 or <lb/>ζ γ 1/γ 2 0.05, where the Coh π 0 contribution is minimal, to obtain <lb/>the normalization of the NC-DIS, 0.86, with a 7.5% statistical preci-<lb/>Fig. 7. Data and MC comparison of the ζ γ 1 distribution. <lb/>sion. The distributions of the NC-DIS variables predicted by the MC <lb/>are corrected using the Data-Simulator (DS) technique: first, NC <lb/>events with a reconstructed primary vertex are selected from both <lb/>data and MC; then, after removing the primary tracks, these events <lb/>are subjected to the Coh π 0 analysis; finally, the ratio Data/MC pro-<lb/>vides the DS-correction. This correction is found to be unity within <lb/>±10%. Table 2 presents the calibrated NC-DIS background. <lb/>Finally, we present the extraction of the Coh π 0 signal which is <lb/>based upon three variables: ζ γ 1 , ζ γ 2 , and Θ 12 , where Θ 12 is the <lb/>opening angle between γ 1 and γ 2. The choice of variables is dic-<lb/>tated by the resolution. The variables ζ γ 1 and ζ γ 2 are correlated <lb/>while Θ 12 displays no correlation with the former variables. A χ 2 <lb/>between data and prediction is defined using two distributions: <lb/>the two-dimensional ζ γ 1 and ζ γ 2 distribution, and the Θ 12 distri-<lb/>bution. The χ 2 between the data and the prediction is minimized <lb/>with respect to the Coh π 0 normalization factor, α. The expected <lb/>numbers of OBG and NC-DIS events are determined as described <lb/>above, and are kept fixed, while the simulated Coh π 0 sample is <lb/>normalized to 5000 generated events. The χ 2 is minimized with <lb/>respect to α which is varied between 0 and 2 in steps of 0.01. The <lb/>minimum χ 2 , 45.1 for 44 degrees of freedom (DoF), is obtained <lb/>for α = 0.985 ± 0.113. The probability of this fit is 0.44. Using the <lb/>number of Coh π 0 signal (112.6) in Table 1 and α = 0.985, we ex-<lb/>tract the observed signal: 110.9 ± 12.5. The error is statistical and <lb/>corresponds to a χ 2 change by one unit. <lb/>To check if the two photon data can be explained using only <lb/>OBG and NC-DIS component, we set the Coh π 0 contribution to <lb/></body>

The error in the π 0 reconstruction efficiency is estimated <lb/>to be 2.7% determined using γ -conversions from standard DIS in-<lb/>teractions. Finally, the error in the absolute flux determination is <lb/>determined to be 2.5% which comes about as follows: the error <lb/>is 2.1% for E ν <lb/>30 GeV, 2.6% for 10 E ν <lb/>30 GeV, and 4.0% for <lb/>2.5 E ν <lb/>10 GeV as determined in [24]; these errors are folded <lb/>in with the Coh π 0 cross section as a function of E ν yielding an <lb/>overall flux normalization error of 2.5%.
