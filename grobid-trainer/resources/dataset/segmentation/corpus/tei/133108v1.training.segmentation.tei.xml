We observe that <lb/>this bias leads biomedical researchers to focus on richly annotated genes instead of those with <lb/>the strongest molecular data. We advocate for researchers to reduce these biases by pursuing <lb/>data-driven hypotheses. <lb/></front>

			<body>2 Introduction <lb/>After analyzing samples with a high throughput technology, the de facto first step is to perform <lb/>pathway or network analysis to identify biological processes that are statistically enriched in the <lb/>data. 1 Researchers typically form hypotheses for their follow up experiments based on the genes <lb/>or proteins involved in the enriched processes. Commonly used resources for identifying gene <lb/>functions and interactions include the Gene Ontology (GO), 2 Reactome, 3 Comparative Toxi-<lb/>1 <lb/>cogenomics Database (CTD), 4 DrugBank, 5 Protein Data Bank (PDB), 6 Pubpular, 7 and NCBI <lb/>GeneRIF. Since these resources are created by curation of the scientific literature, they typi-<lb/>cally only contain functional annotations for genes with published experimental data. Although <lb/>GO includes predicted functional annotations for genes, they are considered of low quality. 8 <lb/>Consequently, researchers select those genes or proteins for further validation that have prior <lb/>experimental evidence, which, in turn, leads to more functional annotations for those genes at <lb/>the expense of under-studied genes. <lb/>We hypothesized that this experimental paradigm has led to a gene-centric disease research <lb/>bias where hypotheses are confounded by the streetlight effect of looking for &quot;answers where <lb/>the light is better rather than where the truth is more likely to lie&quot;. 9-11 To test this hypothesis, <lb/>we examined the annotation inequality for the human genome across a number of biomedical <lb/>databases using gini coefficient, which is a measure of inequality such that high coefficient <lb/>value indicates higher inequality. 12 <lb/>3 Results <lb/>3.1 Gene annotation inequality persists across databases <lb/>Despite the tremendous growth of GO from 20,826 annotations in 2004 for 7,524 human <lb/>genes to 122,926 annotations for 16,173 genes in 2017, annotation inequality in GO has in-<lb/>creased from a gini coefficient of 0.34 in 2004 to 0.50 in 2017. The growth in inequality <lb/>over time validates that genes with existing annotations continue to receive even more anno-<lb/>tations. Pathway databases, including Reactome (gini=0.33) 3 and the CTD (gini=0.47), 4 have <lb/>a similarly high level of inequality. Indeed, every gene annotation resource we examined dis-<lb/>played a similarly high level of annotation inequality, including: CTD chemical-gene associa-<lb/>tions (gini=0.63); 4 PDB 3D protein structures (gini=0.68); 6 DrugBank drug-gene associations <lb/>(gini=0.70); 5 GeneRIF gene publication annotations (gini=0.79); and Pubpular disease-gene <lb/></body>

			<body>publication associations (gini=0.82). 7, 13 We calculated global gene annotation gini coefficient <lb/>of 0.63 when considering the number of annotations pooled across all these databases. When <lb/>comparing annotation inequality in gene resources to income inequality in the world, we ob-<lb/>served that the inequality index for many of the gene resources is higher than any nation in the <lb/>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 14 <lb/>3.2 Annotation inequality bias affects biomedical research <lb/>Next, we explored whether disease research may be affected by the inequality in gene annotation <lb/>databases. General concern that most published findings are false, 15 many results are inflated, 16 <lb/>and research funding is being wasted 17, 18 has led to searches for solutions that will yield re-<lb/>producible and clinically relevant findings. Using a multi-cohort analysis framework, 19, 20 we <lb/>have repeatedly demonstrated that it can identify novel disease-gene relationships that lay out-<lb/>side the &quot;halo of the streetlight&quot;, and which have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic utility <lb/>across diverse diseases including cancer, 21-23 organ transplantation, 19 infectious diseases, 24-27 <lb/>and autoimmunity. 28 <lb/>In our manually curated meta-analyses of 104 distinct human conditions, we have inte-<lb/>grated transcriptome data from over 41,000 patients and 619 studies to calculate an effect size <lb/>for disease-gene associations. 20 Our meta-analyses covered diverse classes of human condi-<lb/>tions, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, viral infection, neurodegenerative and psychiatric <lb/>disorders, pregnancy, and obesity. For these conditions, we extracted all disease gene asso-<lb/>ciations with at least ten publications. 7, 13 Published disease-gene associations exhibited no <lb/>significant correlation with differential gene expression false discovery rate (FDR) rank [Figure <lb/>2A, Spearman&apos;s correlation= -0.005, p = 0.716]. Overall, only 19.5% of published disease-gene <lb/>associations were identified in gene expression meta-analyses at a FDR of 5% [Figure S1a]. <lb/>This result is consistent with previous publications that have successfully replicated between <lb/></body>

(A) The <lb/>number of publications for every disease-gene pair was not significantly correlated with the <lb/>gene expression meta-analysis effect size FDR rank [Spearman&apos;s correlation = -0.005, p = <lb/>0.716]. (B) The number of publications for every disease-gene pair correlated with the number <lb/>of non-inferred from electronic annotation (non-IEA) Gene Ontology annotations [Spearman&apos;s <lb/>correlation = 0.100, p=8.7e-13]. Orange points represent disease-gene associations published <lb/>in our prior meta-analyses. 19, 23, 24 Purple points have at least 1000 publications. See also Figure <lb/>S1. <lb/></body>

			<body>11% -25% of research studies. 29, 30 <lb/>To observe whether this phenomenon was specific to gene expression, we extracted genome <lb/>wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the GWAS catalog. 31 We ob-<lb/>served a nominally significant correlation between the number of publications and SNP p-<lb/>values, indicating moderate concordance between genetic mutations and disease-gene publi-<lb/>cations [Figure S1b, Spearman&apos;s correlation = -0.127, p = 0.015]. <lb/>Based on these results, we hypothesized that the lack of correlation with molecular evidence <lb/>may have been an artifact of research bias towards well-characterized genes. Therefore, we ex-<lb/>amined correspondence between publications about a disease-gene pair and existing knowledge <lb/>about that gene as indicated by the number of GO annotations. Indeed, the number of GO <lb/>annotations for a gene of interest was significantly correlated with the published disease-gene <lb/>associations [Figure 2B, Spearman&apos;s correlation = 0.100, p=8.7e-13], but not with gene expres-<lb/>sion effect size FDR rank in disease [Figure S1c, Spearman&apos;s correlation = -0.010, p = 0.136]. 2 <lb/>Many of the highly published disease-gene associations may have been studied for reasons <lb/>that would not be directly reflected in gene expression analysis, including BRCA1 in breast <lb/>cancer and CD4 in human immunodeficiency virus. The more troubling bias occurs when <lb/>associations with strong molecular evidence have no publication record. Disease-gene associ-<lb/>ations we have reported in our published meta-analyses were typically novel findings with few <lb/>Gene Ontology annotations, despite having extremely low false discovery rates and high effect <lb/>sizes 19, 21, 24 [orange points in Figure 2]. We observed similar patterns when we performed the <lb/>same analysis on similar publication and GWAS data from HuGE Navigator 32, 33 [Figures S1d, <lb/>S1e, S1f]. <lb/></body>

			<body>4 Discussion <lb/> Collectively, our results provide evidence of a strong research bias in literature that focuses on <lb/>well annotated genes instead of the genes with the most significant disease relationship in terms <lb/>of both gene expression and genetic variation. While focusing research on the best character-<lb/>ized genes may be natural because it is easy to formulate a mechanistic hypothesis of the gene&apos;s <lb/>function in disease, we propose that omics-era researchers should instead allow data to drive <lb/>their hypotheses. Our prior work shows that expanding research outside of the streetlight of <lb/>well characterized genes identifies novel disease-gene relationships, leads to successful repur-<lb/>posings of drugs, and provides clinically actionable diagnostics. 19, 21-27, 34 To enable researchers <lb/>to pursue data-driven hypotheses, we have made our gene expression meta-analysis data pub-<lb/>licly available at [http://metasignature.stanford.edu] where it may be explored based on either <lb/>diseases or genes of interest. By focusing on genes with the strongest molecular evidence in-<lb/>stead of the most annotations, researchers will break the self-perpetuating annotation inequality <lb/>cycle that results in research bias. <lb/>5 Materials and Methods <lb/>5.1 Gini coefficient calculation. <lb/>We calculated the gini coefficients using the R package ineq. 35 We included all human genes <lb/>with at least one annotation in the gini calculations. We used the Entrez Gene list downloaded in <lb/>February 2017 of 20,698 current, protein-coding, human genes as our source of human genes. <lb/>We calculated the number of annotations for each human gene in the Gene Ontology. 2 We <lb/>only considered the biological process and molecular function categories and excluded terms <lb/>with evidence codes IEA and ND. Duplicate annotations that only differ in evidence codes <lb/>were counted once. We calculated the number of annotations in the January 2004 release and <lb/></body>

We converted UniProt identifiers to gene names using the UniProt identifier conversion <lb/>tool. 36 We calculated the number of pathways including each gene name. <lb/>We downloaded the CTD 4 data in February 2017, with the chemical-gene associations and <lb/>the gene-pathway associations. We calculated the number of chemical-gene and gene-pathway <lb/>associations for each gene name. <lb/>We downloaded GeneRIFs from the NCBI in February 2017. We included all human <lb/>GeneRIFS (Tax ID: 9606). We calculated the number of GeneRIFs for each gene. <lb/>We downloaded the gene names associated with protein structures from the Protein Data <lb/>Bank 6 in February 2017 and calculated the number of structures per gene name. <lb/>We downloaded the DrugBank 5 database version 5.0.5 and identified all drugs with known <lb/>activities on human genes. We calculated the number of drugs targeting each gene. <lb/>We downloaded OECD 14 nation income inequality gini coefficients from the July 2016 data <lb/>release at http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database. <lb/>htm. <lb/>The code and data we used to run this analysis is available at http://khatrilab. <lb/>stanford.edu/researchbias. <lb/></body>

			<body>5.2 Gene expression data collection and meta-analysis. <lb/>Gene expression meta-analysis data was compiled from the MetaSignature database. 20 MetaSig-<lb/>nature includes data from manual meta-analysis of over 41,000 samples, 619 studies, and 104 <lb/>diseases. Briefly, relevant data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and Array-<lb/>Express. 37, 38 Cases and controls were manually labeled for each disease and meta-analysis was <lb/>performed using the MetaIntegrator package. 20 We used the Hedges&apos; g summary effect size, <lb/>standard error, and false discovery rate which the MetaIntegrator package calculates for every <lb/>gene. <lb/>5.3 Data collection for disease-gene publications and SNP data. <lb/>We downloaded the number of publications for each disease-gene relationship from PubPular <lb/>and HuGE Navigator in August 2016 for as many of the 104 disease in MetaSignature as were <lb/>present in the databases (102 in PubPular and 81 in HuGE). 7, 13, 32 PubPular gave the top 261 <lb/>gene associations, and HuGE gave all known associations. For all correlations, we only consid-<lb/>ered disease-gene associations with at least 10 publications to limit false positive associations. <lb/>We downloaded disease-SNP relationships, including gene mappings, odds ratios, and p-<lb/>values, from the GWAS Catalog and HuGE Navigator for 61 and 54, respectively, of the 103 <lb/>diseases in MetaSignature. 31, 33 From Gene Ontology, we calculated the counts of non-Inferred <lb/>from Electronic Annotation annotations for all the genes in the MetaSignature database. 2 The <lb/>Spearman rank correlation was used for all correlations. <lb/>Our plots show the top 10,000 gene associations for each disease by effect size FDR rank. <lb/>Correlation calculations do not include a similar limit. <lb/></body>
