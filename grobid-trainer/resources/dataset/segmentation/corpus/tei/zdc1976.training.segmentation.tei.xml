NESTO, MD 9 <lb/>FOR THE NHLBI-SPONSORED PTCA AND <lb/>DYNAMIC REGISTRIES INVESTIGATORS <lb/>OBJECTIVE -To evaluate the association of successive percutaneous coronary intervention <lb/>(PCI) modalities with balloon angioplasty (BA), bare-metal stent (BMS), drug-eluting stents <lb/>(DES), and pharmacotherapy over the last 3 decades with outcomes among patients with dia-<lb/>betes in routine clinical practice. <lb/>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -We examined outcomes in 1,846 patients with <lb/>diabetes undergoing de novo PCI in the multicenter, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-<lb/>sponsored 1985-1986 Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry and <lb/>1997-2006 Dynamic Registry. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the ad-<lb/>justed risk of events (death/myocardial infarction [MI], repeat revascularization) over 1 year. <lb/>RESULTS -Cumulative event rates for postdischarge (31-365 days) death/MI were 8% by <lb/>BA, 7% by BMS, and 7% by DES use (P ϭ 0.76) and for repeat revascularization were 19, 13, and <lb/>9% (P Ͻ 0.001), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower risk of repeat <lb/>revascularization with DES use when compared with the use of BA (hazard ratio [HR] 0.41 [95% <lb/>CI 0.29 -0.58]) and BMS (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.39 -0.76]). After further adjustment for discharge <lb/>medications, the lower risk for death/MI was not statistically significant for DES when compared <lb/>with BA. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS -In patients with diabetes undergoing PCI, the use of DES is associated <lb/>with a reduced need for repeat revascularization when compared with BA or BMS use. The <lb/>associated death/MI benefit observed with the DES versus the BA group may well be due to <lb/>greater use of pharmacotherapy. <lb/>Diabetes Care 33:1976-1982, 2010 <lb/></front>

			<body>T <lb/>he practice of percutaneous coro-<lb/>nary intervention (PCI) has evolved <lb/>rapidly in the past 3 decades, with <lb/>technological advancements from balloon <lb/>angioplasty (BA) to bare-metal stents <lb/>(BMS) and the more recent drug-eluting <lb/>stents (DES) (1). Comparisons of device-<lb/>specific outcomes have yielded similar <lb/>results, with a recent meta-analysis re-<lb/>porting a significant reduction in the rate <lb/>of target lesion revascularization, but not <lb/>mortality, with DES use compared with <lb/>BMS use (2). <lb/>Coronary angioplasty in patients with <lb/>diabetes has been shown to have a higher <lb/>rate of infarction and a greater need for <lb/>additional revascularization procedures <lb/>(3). In a large consecutive series of pa-<lb/>tients treated by elective stent implanta-<lb/>tion, patients with diabetes were at higher <lb/>risk for in-hospital mortality and subse-<lb/>quent revascularization, which ultimately <lb/>resulted in a significantly lower cardiac <lb/>event-free survival rate (4). Yet, the bene-<lb/>fit of DES over BMS remains unclear. A <lb/>pooled analysis (5) reported a significant <lb/>difference in survival in favor of BMS over <lb/>the DES, whereas no significant difference <lb/>in mortality was observed in another anal-<lb/>ysis of 14 randomized controlled trials <lb/>(6). Given these inconsistent findings and <lb/>the growing percentage of diabetic pa-<lb/>tients undergoing PCI, the impact of ad-<lb/>vances in PCI technology and adjunct <lb/>improvement in pharmacotherapy on <lb/>outcomes in patients with diabetes needs <lb/>to be assessed. <lb/>We, therefore, investigated the effec-<lb/>tiveness of PCI in patients with diabetes <lb/>by comparing 1-year rates of death/ <lb/>myocardial infarction (MI) and repeat re-<lb/>vascularization across the three device <lb/>modalities: BA, BMS, and DES. Data from <lb/>the multicenter, National Heart, Lung, <lb/>and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored <lb/>1985-1986 Percutaneous Transluminal <lb/>Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry <lb/>and the 1997-2006 Dynamic Registry <lb/>were used for this purpose. <lb/>RESEARCH DESIGN AND <lb/>METHODS -The NHLBI-sponsored <lb/>PTCA and Dynamic Registries were pro-<lb/>spective multicenter studies that enrolled <lb/>patients undergoing coronary interven-<lb/>tions in centers from North America (7-<lb/>9). The 1985-1986 PTCA Registry <lb/>recruited 2,000 consecutive patients un-<lb/>dergoing de novo BA. The Dynamic Reg-<lb/>istry was initiated after the advent of BMS <lb/></body>

			<body>and enrolled patients in recruitment <lb/>waves of ϳ2,000 patients (1: 1997-1998, <lb/>n ϭ 2,524; 2: 1999, n ϭ 2,105; 3: 2001-<lb/>2002, n ϭ 2,047; 4: 2004, n ϭ 2,112; 5: <lb/>2006, n ϭ 2,178). Information on patient <lb/>characteristics and detailed angiographic <lb/>and procedural data were ascertained at <lb/>baseline. Written informed consent was <lb/>obtained from participants, all of whom <lb/>agreed to be contacted annually after dis-<lb/>charge. The study protocol was approved <lb/>by the Institutional Review Boards of the <lb/>coordinating center (University of Pitts-<lb/>burgh) and all the clinical sites. <lb/>Data on events including all-cause <lb/>death, MI, coronary artery bypass surgery <lb/>(CABG), and repeat PCI were ascertained, <lb/>and hospital records were examined to <lb/>ensure consistency with protocol defini-<lb/>tions. Specifically, the definition of MI <lb/>was revised to match prevailing expert <lb/>consensus; in the PTCA Registry, it was <lb/>defined as evidence of two or more of the <lb/>following: 1) typical chest pain Ͼ20 min <lb/>not relieved by nitroglycerin, 2) serial <lb/>ECG recordings showing changes from <lb/>baseline or serially in ST-T and/or Q-<lb/>waves in two or more contiguous leads, or <lb/>3) serum enzyme elevation of CK-MB <lb/>Ͼ5% of total creatinine kinase (CK) (total <lb/>CK more than twice that of normal; LDH <lb/>subtype 1 Ͼ LDH subtype 2); in the Dy-<lb/>namic Registry, cardiac troponin level <lb/>was incorporated as a major criteria. <lb/>This analysis was restricted to pa-<lb/>tients with reported diabetes at baseline. <lb/>In the PTCA Registry, history of diabetes <lb/>was ascertained through review of medi-<lb/>cal records by site coordinators and <lb/>through patient self-report. Baseline <lb/>treatment status (insulin or hypoglycemic <lb/>agent versus diet controlled) was not <lb/>identified or recorded by site coordina-<lb/>tors (7). The Dynamic Registry identified <lb/>study patients with diabetes according to <lb/>the use of oral hypoglycemic agents, diet, <lb/>or treatment with insulin (9). Both regis-<lb/>tries did not explicitly identify the type of <lb/>diabetes (type 1 versus type 2). Patients <lb/>were then categorized by the type of de-<lb/>vice received (BA, BMS, or DES) at the <lb/>time of the index procedure. Because of <lb/>the availability of multiple treatment mo-<lb/>dalities in some recruitment waves, a se-<lb/>lection bias was anticipated. Given this, <lb/>BA patients were drawn from the PTCA <lb/>Registry and only from wave 1 of the Dy-<lb/>namic Registry, BMS patients were se-<lb/>lected from waves 1-3 of the Dynamic <lb/>Registry, and DES patients were from <lb/>waves 4 and 5 of the Dynamic Registry. <lb/>Patients who received both BA and BMS <lb/>were categorized as BMS, and those who <lb/>received both BMS and DES were classi-<lb/>fied as DES. <lb/>Statistical methods <lb/>Differences in baseline patient and proce-<lb/>dural characteristics across the three de-<lb/>vice types were evaluated using the <lb/>Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous vari-<lb/>ables and the 2 test for categorical vari-<lb/>ables. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of <lb/>1-year event rates for combined death/MI <lb/>and repeat revascularizations (repeat PCI <lb/>or CABG) were compared using the log-<lb/>rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI <lb/>for events 31-365 days after index PCI <lb/>(&quot;late&quot; events) were estimated using Cox <lb/>regression analysis models for 1) BMS and <lb/>DES versus BA groups, and 2) DES versus <lb/>BMS groups. For multivariable adjust-<lb/>ment, only those data available in both <lb/>registries with significant univariate dif-<lb/>ferences across the three device categories <lb/>and outcomes were considered. All anal-<lb/>yses were performed with SAS version 9.1 <lb/>(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Baseline patient characteristics <lb/>Table 1 shows baseline characteristics by <lb/>the type of device used for the 1,846 pa-<lb/>tients with diabetes who underwent de <lb/>novo PCI. On average, although the BMS <lb/>patients were older, patients who re-<lb/>ceived DES were more likely to report <lb/>concomitant comorbidities (history of hy-<lb/>pertension, dyslipidemia, and renal dis-<lb/>ease). No significant differences were <lb/>noted in the type of treatment for diabetes <lb/>among the BMS-and DES-treated <lb/>patients. <lb/>Angiographic, procedural, and lesion <lb/>characteristics <lb/>The DES patients were more likely to have <lb/>triple vessel disease and more significant <lb/>lesions at baseline (Tables 2 and 3).

			<body>who underwent PCI for acute MI, the pro-<lb/>portion of patients in cardiogenic shock <lb/>was higher in the BA group (BA 32%, BMS <lb/>14%, DES 2%; P Ͻ 0.001). Procedural <lb/>use of thienopyridine was higher in the <lb/>DES patients (BA 7%, BMS 57%, DES <lb/>87%; P Ͻ 0.001).

Rates of in-<lb/>hospital mortality, MI, and repeat revas-<lb/>cularizations were significantly higher in <lb/>the BA group (Fig. 1A). The average <lb/>length of stay among patients alive at dis-<lb/>charge was higher for those in the BA <lb/>group (mean number of days: BA 4.2, <lb/>BMS 2.8, DES 2.1 days, P Ͻ 0.001). The <lb/>prescribed use of recommended medica-<lb/>tions such as aspirin, ACE inhibitors, <lb/>␤-blockers, lipid-lowering therapy, and <lb/>antiplatelet therapy among those alive at <lb/>discharge was significantly higher in the <lb/>BMS and DES groups (Fig. 1B). <lb/>Significant differences were observed <lb/>in the 1-year unadjusted cumulative <lb/>event rates by device type following index <lb/>PCI. The overall incidence rates of <lb/>death/MI (BA 16%, BMS 13%, DES 10%; <lb/>P ϭ 0.01) and repeat PCI/CABG (BA <lb/>30%, BMS 20%, DES 13%; P Ͻ 0.001) <lb/>were much lower in the BMS and DES <lb/>patients than in the BA groups. However, <lb/>the restriction of the analysis to late events <lb/>(31-365 days) revealed similar rates of <lb/>mortality or MI (Fig. 2). Multivariable <lb/>Cox regression analysis models compar-<lb/>ing BMS and DES with BA, and adjusting <lb/>for baseline characteristics, showed a <lb/>lower risk of mortality/MI, which did not <lb/>achieve statistical significance for BMS <lb/>(Fig. 3). Further adjustment for the dis-<lb/>charge use of cardiac medications altered <lb/>the pattern for death/MI for DES, which <lb/>became statistically nonsignificant with <lb/>BA as reference (DES, HR 0.60 [95% CI <lb/>0.29 -1.22]; P ϭ 0.16), and the risk of <lb/>repeat revascularization remained statisti-<lb/>cally significant only with DES use with <lb/>BA as reference (DES, 0.57 [0.36 -0.91]; <lb/>P ϭ 0.02).

			<body>the need for repeat revascularization <lb/>(Fig. 3). <lb/>CONCLUSIONS -Using data from <lb/>the multicenter, NHLBI-sponsored PTCA <lb/>and Dynamic Registries, we describe the <lb/>characteristics of patients with diabetes <lb/>undergoing de novo PCI and compare <lb/>related outcomes across the three key <lb/>devices-BA, BMS, and DES in the field. <lb/>The profile of patients and lesions un-<lb/>dergoing PCI today has expanded to in-<lb/>clude sicker cases with greater disease <lb/>burden. Compared with BA, patients <lb/>treated with BMS or DES were also more <lb/>likely to be discharged on evidence-<lb/>based cardiac medications. Impor-<lb/>tantly, DES use was associated with a <lb/>comparable risk of death/MI once ad-<lb/>justed for pharmacotherapy in this <lb/>high-risk subset. <lb/>There have been questions regarding <lb/>the risk of late stent thrombosis associated <lb/>with DES in higher-risk patients, and the <lb/>danger of early discontinuation of anti-<lb/>platelet therapy (10). Recent data from <lb/>Europe however has shown that com-<lb/>pared with BMS, DES is associated with a <lb/>similar long-term incidence of death or <lb/>MI but provides a clinically important re-<lb/>duction in the rate of restenosis among <lb/>high-risk patients (11). Our analysis <lb/>found significant reductions in the need <lb/>for repeat revascularization with DES use <lb/>compared with BA and BMS and no dif-<lb/>ference in death/MI once adjusted for <lb/>pharmacotherapy. <lb/>Unrestricted use of DES has been <lb/>shown to have better outcomes than BMS, <lb/>with fewer clinically driven revasculariza-<lb/>tion procedures and similar rates of death <lb/>and MI at 1 year (12). However, pooled <lb/>analyses in patients with diabetes have <lb/>shown conflicting results regarding sur-<lb/>vival when comparing BMS-and DES-<lb/>treated patients (5,6). In a previous report <lb/>from the 1997-1999 Dynamic Registry <lb/>patients with diabetes were shown to have <lb/>Figure 1-In-hospital outcomes (A) and discharge medication* use (B) after PCI by device type in patients with diabetes. *Percentages of <lb/>antiplatelets and lipid-lowering drugs predominantly reflect information from the NHLBI-sponsored Dynamic Registry patients. <lb/></body>

			<body>had a significantly higher adjusted risk of <lb/>mortality and need for repeat revascular-<lb/>ization than those without diabetes (13). <lb/>Another study from the Dynamic Registry <lb/>compared the efficacy of DES with BMS in <lb/>patients with insulin-and non-insulin-<lb/>treated diabetes and showed that DES was <lb/>associated with a lower risk for repeat re-<lb/>vascularization compared with BMS in <lb/>both insulin-and non-insulin-treated pa-<lb/>tients (14). More recent data from this <lb/>group extended these findings to show <lb/>that, among this high-risk subset, PCI <lb/>outcomes did not differ by the type of <lb/>DES (sirolimus-or paclitaxel-eluting) <lb/>used (15). <lb/>Pharmacotherapy has also evolved <lb/>over recent decades and has contributed <lb/>to the reduction in the number of cardiac <lb/>deaths (16). The impact of the evolution <lb/>of both devices and pharmacotherapy, es-<lb/>pecially among patients with diabetes un-<lb/>dergoing PCI over the last 3 decades, <lb/>remains a matter of interest. Our study <lb/>explored the use of pharmacotherapy at <lb/>discharge to show that recommended <lb/>medications such as aspirin, ACE inhibi-<lb/>tors, ␤-blockers, lipid-lowering therapy, <lb/>and antiplatelet therapy is considerably <lb/>higher in the BMS and DES groups and <lb/>may have played an important role in the <lb/>observed favorable outcomes in these <lb/>groups. <lb/>Study limitations <lb/>For the purposes of this analysis, only <lb/>those variables available in both the reg-<lb/>istries were considered. Compared with <lb/>the PTCA Registry, ascertainment of data <lb/>in the Dynamic Registry was revised to <lb/>incorporate information related to the <lb/>prevailing concerns in the field. Specifi-<lb/>cally, data regarding the treatment of dia-<lb/>betes and presence of renal disease or <lb/>biochemical parameters of renal function <lb/>were unavailable in the PTCA Registry, <lb/>thus limiting our ability to account for dif-<lb/>ferences in these parameters. Information <lb/>on duration of diabetes, extent of glucose <lb/>controls, or specific dosages of discharge <lb/>pharmacotherapy was also not available. <lb/>The registries did not specify, a priori, es-<lb/>timates of detectable effect sizes for indi-<lb/>vidual devices used or subgroup analyses. <lb/>Nonetheless, post hoc power calculations <lb/>based on the observed late event rates <lb/>showed an 80% power (two-sided type I <lb/>error rate of 0.05 and 5% lost to follow-<lb/>up) to detect modest-to-large effect sizes <lb/>of 0.46 and 0.63 for death/MI and repeat <lb/>revascularization, respectively, with DES <lb/>use compared with BA use. Finally, as <lb/>with all observational studies, there may <lb/>be residual confounding not fully ac-<lb/>counted for in the standard multivariable <lb/>analyses. <lb/>In conclusion, our report from the <lb/>large, prospective, multicenter, NHLBI-<lb/>sponsored 1985-1986 PTCA (BA era) <lb/>and 1997-2006 Dynamic Registry (BMS <lb/>and DES era) documents the rapid evolu-<lb/>tion in PCI treatment options for patients <lb/>with diabetes. Contemporary devices of <lb/>PCI were used more often in patients with <lb/>severe comorbidities and multivessel dis-<lb/>ease and were associated with improved <lb/>discharge use of recommended cardiac <lb/>medications.
