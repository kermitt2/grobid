Dried distillers&apos; grains with solubles <lb/>(DDGS) is a byproduct of the fermentation process in the beverage industry and can be used <lb/>as a large supply source of fiber in feed. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with male <lb/>broiler chickens to investigate the effect of various types of enzymes on DDGS and compare <lb/>the efficacy of single enzyme and multienzyme complexes on growth performance and gut <lb/>environments in broiler chickens. We used 420 1-day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308), and they <lb/>were allotted into 4 dietary treatments with seven replications (CON, corn-SBM diet; NC, <lb/>DDGS supplemented diet; SE, 0.05 % of mannanase supplemented DDGS-based diet; MC, <lb/>0.10 % of multienzyme complex (mannanase and xylanase, glucanase) supplemented DDGS-<lb/>based diet. The dietary exogenous enzyme in the DDGS-supplemented diet could improve <lb/>growth performance as much as the growth of the control group, and digestibility of dry matter, <lb/>crude protein, and gross energy were significantly increased by enzyme addition in groups of <lb/>chicks fed DDGS-supplementation diet. Moreover, the populations of pathogenic bacteria, <lb/>coliforms, and Bacteroidetes were significantly decreased by enzyme supplementation, which <lb/>might lead to improved gut mucus-secreting cells and inflammatory cytokines in the jejunum. <lb/>Collectively, dietary single enzyme and multienzyme complexes could improve gut <lb/>environments, including intestinal immune responses and gut microbial population, and lead <lb/>to improvement of growth performance in broiler chickens. <lb/>Keywords: enzyme, multienzyme complex, growth performance, nutrient digestibility, gut <lb/>environment, broiler chicken. <lb/>A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/></front>

        <body>Introduction <lb/>Nutrient digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract are vital factors in the <lb/>growth and metabolic functions of animals because only digested nutrients can be used as the <lb/>backbone of fat and protein in livestock animals. Accordingly, the use of easily digested feed <lb/>ingredients (soybean meal, dairy products, plasma protein, corn meal, etc.) could dramatically <lb/>improve the productivity of livestock compared to high-nonstarch polysaccharide-containing <lb/>feed ingredients (wheat, barley, cottonseed meal, etc.) [1, 2]. As the price of easily digested <lb/>feed ingredients gradually increases, the livestock industry has difficulty applying these <lb/>materials in feed; nevertheless, developing new feed ingredients is difficult due to the limitation <lb/>of the cultivation area and competition between humans and animals [3]. Therefore, recent <lb/>studies have focused on improving the nutritional value of the feed itself by using additional <lb/>feed supplements, including enzymes, probiotics, emulsifiers, etc. [4-6]. <lb/>One of the methods to solve the grain-price problem is using ingredients that are less <lb/>expensive but have the same or increased nutritional value [7, 8]. A byproduct of the beverage <lb/>industry with several different grains used in the fermentation process, dried distillers&apos; grains <lb/>with solubles (DDGS), was introduced to the feed industry in the 1930s [9]. However, the <lb/>inclusion of DDGS in broiler rations reduced digestibility and nutrient availability due to the <lb/>high fiber content of DDGS [10]. Lio and Wang reported that supplementary enzymes in animal <lb/>diets, such as xylanase or cellulase, could be used to overcome this problem [11]. Another <lb/>experiment demonstrated that supplementary xylanase was proven to promote animal <lb/>performance by improving digestibility [12]. Nian explained that chicks fed a diet including <lb/>xylanase improved nutrient and energy utilization and reduced heat increment [13]. Because <lb/>of the activity of xylanase, more dietary fiber in the diet was degraded, and hemicellulose <lb/>digestibility was also increased. <lb/></body>

        <body>There are various types of enzymes used as feed supplements in the livestock industry, <lb/>which can be largely divided into a single enzyme (SE) and a multienzyme complex (MC) [14, <lb/>15]. An example of a single enzyme (β-mannanase) is a type of enzyme that targets hard-to-<lb/>75 <lb/>digest ingredients in feed, and an enzyme complex is intended to simultaneously increase the <lb/>digestibility of various nutrients in feed by adding diverse enzymes at the same time [16, 17]. <lb/>However, since the effects of multienzyme complexes on livestock growth performance are <lb/>still controversial, further comparison studies will be needed on the efficacies of single <lb/>enzymes and multienzyme complexes. Collectively, we conducted an experiment with broiler <lb/>80 <lb/>chickens to investigate the feed supplementation effect of a single enzyme and multienzyme <lb/>complex, and we also analyzed the feed dependence of dietary enzymes. <lb/></body>

        <body>Materials and Methods <lb/>Birds and diets <lb/>Four hundred twenty male Ross-308® broiler chicks (1 day old) were individually <lb/>weighed and allotted into a 4 experimental treatment groups with 7 replications, and 15 chicks <lb/>were housed in each pen. The experimental treatments was as follow: CON, control group fed <lb/>with corn-SBM diet; NC, group fed with DDGS supplemented diet; SE, group fed with 0.05% <lb/>of mannanase supplemented DDGS-based diet; MC, group fed with 0.10 % of multienzyme <lb/>complex (mannanase and xylanase, glucanase) supplemented DDGS-based diet. The <lb/>experiment was conducted for 35 days, feeding a starter diet for the first 7 days, a grower diet <lb/>for the next 14 days, and a finisher diet for the last 14 days. Diets were formulated based on <lb/>National Research Council in mash form to meet or exceed the nutrient requirements of broilers <lb/>except for energy content (NRC, 1994). The starter diet included 5% DDGS, and the grower <lb/>and finisher diets included 10% DDGS as commercially used in the Korean feed industry. The <lb/>compositions of the experimental diets are given in Table 1. Body weight (BW) and feed intake <lb/>were measured at the end of each phase after 8 hours of feed deprivation, and average daily <lb/>gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency (FE) were calculated. <lb/>Sample collection <lb/>After 35 days of the growth experiment, 3 broilers from each pen were sacrificed, and <lb/>cecum content and jejunum tissue were collected. Cecum content was used to determine the <lb/>microbial population between Lactobacillus, coliforms, and Bacteroidetes by employing <lb/>quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with specific primers after <lb/>genomic DNA extraction. Additionally, jejunum samples were used for morphological <lb/>determination (villus height and crypt depth and mucus-secreting cells). mRNA was extracted <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <body>from jejunum samples, and the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined <lb/>with real-time PCR. <lb/>Digestibility <lb/>Digestibility was determined after the end of the growth experiment [18, 19]. Broilers <lb/>were fed a diet containing Cr2O3 for two days, 3 birds were sacrificed in each pen, and digesta <lb/>were collected. Total tract apparent digestibility was calculated by measuring the dry matter of <lb/>consumed feed and excreta from each bird (replicate) and employed for determining dry matter <lb/>(DM), crude protein (CP), and gross energy (GE). <lb/>Histological analysis of the jejunum <lb/>Jejunum samples were fixed in formalin solution and embedded into paraffin blocks. <lb/>We prepared 5-μm cross sections using a Rotary Microtome CUT 5062 (SLEE MAINZ, Mainz, <lb/>Germany), and these sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Alcian blue staining <lb/>methods. Fifteen villi and crypts were randomly selected and measured to calculate the ratio of <lb/>villus height to crypt depth. A blind observer measured villus height and crypt depth and <lb/>counted the goblet cell numbers. <lb/>mRNA analysis by qRT-PCR analysis <lb/>TRIzol® (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) was used to extract total RNA from <lb/>jejunum samples according to the manufacturer&apos;s procedure, and the RNA purity and <lb/>concentration were measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, <lb/>Wilmington, DE, USA). cDNA samples were synthesized with the High-Capacity cDNA <lb/></body>

        <body>Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Gene expression levels <lb/>related to the immune response in the jejunum (IL-2, interleukin-2; IL-4, interleukin-4; IL-6, <lb/>interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TGF-β, transforming <lb/>growth factor β) were determined using a RealHelix TM Premier qPCR kit (NanoHelix, Daejun, <lb/>Korea) with a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). <lb/>Primers for the target genes are listed in Table 2. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase <lb/>(GAPDH) was used as a housekeeping gene, and the 2 -ΔΔCt method was used to quantify relative <lb/>mRNA expression levels. <lb/>Bacterial DNA extraction in cecal contents <lb/>A Quick-DNA TM Fecal/Soil Microbe Microprep Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) was <lb/>used to extract total genomic DNA from the cecal samples according to the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>protocol. The concentration and purity of bacterial DNA were determined using a Nanodrop <lb/>spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). <lb/>Cecal bacteria analysis by qRT-PCR <lb/>The population of cecal bacteria (Lactobacillus, coliforms, and Bacteroidetes) was <lb/>determined using a RealHelixTM Premier qPCR kit (NanoHelix, Daejun, Korea) with a <lb/>StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the <lb/>expression level of total bacteria was used as a housekeeping gene. Primers for the target genes <lb/>are listed in Table 2, and the 2 -ΔΔCt method was used to quantify relative gut microbial <lb/>population levels. <lb/></body>

        <body>Statistical Analysis <lb/>All data were analyzed using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Statistical System <lb/>9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The experimental unit of growth performance was a pen, <lb/>and the experimental units of results related to digestibility, gut morphological indices, cecal <lb/>microbial population, and jejunal inflammatory cytokines were a chick. Significant differences <lb/>between treatments were determined using Duncan&apos;s multiple-range tests and were defined at <lb/>the P &lt; 0.05 level. <lb/>Results <lb/>Growth performance <lb/>Broiler chickens fed the control diet showed better growth performance than DDGS-<lb/>supplemented diet-consuming chickens. On Day 35, the BWs of birds in the MC group was <lb/>significantly heavier than the BWs in the NC group (Table 1; P &lt; 0.05). In finisher phase, ADFI <lb/>of MC group was significantly increased compared to CON and NC treatment groups, and the <lb/>FE of DDGS-supplemented diet groups were significantly lower compared to CON group (P &lt; <lb/>0.05). In the overall experimental period, MC supplementation significantly increased ADG <lb/>compared to the CON group; however, ADFI also increased by SE and MC supplementation <lb/>compared to CON group (P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, dietary SE and MC could increase growth in <lb/>DDGS-supplemented diet groups as much as that of CON group, and it might be due to the <lb/>increment of ADFI by SE and MC supplementation. <lb/>Digestibility <lb/>All kinds of nutrient digestibility (DM, CP, and GE) were significantly decreased by <lb/>DDGS supplementation in the basal diet (Figure 1). However, dietary SE and MC <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <body>supplementation in the DDGS diet could restore DM, CP, and GE digestibility as much as those <lb/>of the corn-SBM diet group. <lb/>Cecal bacterial population <lb/>The cecal bacterial population is shown in Figure 2. The population of Lactobacillus <lb/>was significantly increased by dietary MC supplementation compared to the CON group <lb/>(Figure 2A, P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the population of coliforms was significantly decreased by <lb/>SE and MC supplementation in the DDGS-supplemented diet groups compared to NC group <lb/>(Figure 2B; P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, dietary addition of SE and MC significantly decreased the <lb/>population of Bacteroidetes compared to the CON and NC groups (Figure 2C; P &lt; 0.05). <lb/>Gut histological analysis <lb/>The jejunal morphological indices are presented in Figure 3, and representative <lb/>pictures of jejunum cross sections stained by the hematoxylin and eosin method and Alcian <lb/>blue method are shown in Figure 4. The villus height in the enzyme-supplemented groups were <lb/>significantly higher than those of NC group without affecting the crypt depth (Figure 3A and <lb/>3B; P &lt; 0.05). The ratio of villus height to crypt depth was significantly decreased in the DDGS <lb/>group among treatments; however, dietary SE and MC supplementation significantly increased <lb/>as much as that of CON group (Figure 3C; P &lt; 0.05). DDGS supplementation decreased the <lb/>goblet cell count; however, the dietary enzyme-supplemented groups showed restoration of <lb/>goblet cells compared to the NC group (Figure 3D; P &lt; 0.05). <lb/>Gene expression levels in the jejunum <lb/>The gene expression levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines are presented in Figure 5. <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <body>Dietary SE supplementation in the DDGS diet significantly increased the expression level of <lb/>IL-4 compared to NC and MC treatment groups, and dietary DDGS supplementation also <lb/>significantly decreased the expression level of IL-6 compared to CON group (Figure 5A and <lb/>5B; P &lt; 0.05). Otherwise, dietary DDGS supplementation could increase the expression level <lb/>of TGF-β, however the SE and MC supplementation could decrease the TGF-β level as much <lb/>as that of CON group (Figure 5C; P &lt; 0.05). <lb/>The mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines are shown in Figure 6. <lb/>The expression level of IL-2 was significantly lower in NC group compared to CON and SE <lb/>groups (Figure 6A; P &lt; 0.05). However, dietary SE supplementation in DDGS-supplemented <lb/>diet showed significantly lower expression level of TNF-α compared to the levels of NC and <lb/>MC diet groups (Figure 6B; P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the expression level of IFN-γ was increased <lb/>by DDGS supplementation; however, SE could reduce the IFN-γ expression level to as much <lb/>as the level of the CON group (Figure 6C; P &lt; 0.05). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of SE and MC when they are <lb/>supplemented in two types of diets, corn-SBM diet and DDGS-supplemented diet, and the <lb/>results of this study demonstrated that each enzyme additive improves the growth of broiler <lb/>chickens via different mechanisms according to diet type. All kinds of enzymes in the DDGS-<lb/>supplemented diet could increase nutrient digestibility, including DM, CP, and GE, and we can <lb/>assume that dietary enzymes could improve nutrient bioavailability by modulating the gut <lb/>microbiome population. In particular, dietary enzymes significantly reduce the population of <lb/>Bacteroidetes, which is related to the host&apos;s hepatic lipid metabolism. However, SE and MC1 <lb/>supplementation in the corn-SBM diet showed improved growth performance, and MC2 <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <body>supplementation in the DDGS diet also showed better growth performance compared to the <lb/>DDGS group. In the corn-SBM diet groups, SE addition decreased proinflammatory cytokines <lb/>by decreasing the pathogenic bacterial population. Coliforms and Bacteroidetes were found in <lb/>the gut microbiome. Otherwise, MC1 supplementation in the corn-SBM diet increased the <lb/>Lactobacillus population and could lead to improved gut morphological environments and <lb/>accelerated growth. In the DDGS-supplemented diet groups, MC2 addition significantly <lb/>upregulated growth performance, with an increased beneficial bacterial population and a <lb/>reduced pathogenic bacterial population. Dietary MC2 in the DDGS diet also significantly <lb/>improved gut microenvironments, including the local immune response and gut morphological <lb/>indices. <lb/>Dietary exogenous enzyme addition in a DDGS-supplemented diet could increase the <lb/>bird&apos;s growth performance to as much as the growth performance of the control group. This <lb/>result indicates that dietary supplementation with exogenous enzymes could increase the <lb/>nutrient availability of feed itself by supplementing the fiber contents of DDGS. In 2021, Van <lb/>Hoeck et al. demonstrated that dietary xylanase and wheat supplementation could increase the <lb/>growth of birds [20]. In addition, Klarie also proposed that dietary β-mannanase <lb/>supplementation could accelerate growth in diverse livestock animal models, including broiler <lb/>chickens, laying hens, turkeys, sows, and nursery-finishing pigs [21]. Collectively, dietary <lb/>enzymes with their proper high-NSP-containing feed ingredients could be advantageous in the <lb/>livestock industry. <lb/>Exogenous enzyme supplementation in a DDGS-supplemented diet resulted in <lb/>increased DM, CP, and GE digestibility compared to no enzyme-supplemented groups. In <lb/>accordance with our study, Fries-Crast et al. also demonstrated that DDGS as a dietary <lb/>ingredient could reduce nutrient digestibility [22]. However, the results of the study of Hussain <lb/></body>

        A C <lb/>C <lb/>E P T E D <lb/>

        <body>et al. indicated that dietary exogenous enzyme supplementation could recover nutrient <lb/>digestibility, including dry matter, crude protein, and energy, as much as that of the control <lb/>group [23]. In particular, SE supplementation presented the highest GE digestibility among <lb/>treatments, and this result agreed with the studies performed by Latham and White. They <lb/>demonstrated that β-mannanase supplementation could increase energy utilization and <lb/>digestibility in both laying hens and broiler chickens [24, 25]. Additionally, Ko and colleagues <lb/>also demonstrated that dietary enzyme addition could increase DM and GE digestibility [26]. <lb/>Altogether, this study could propose that DDGS would decrease nutrient availability when it is <lb/>used as a feed ingredient; however, dietary enzyme supplementation could restore these <lb/>harmful effects. <lb/>Dietary inclusion of DDGS could increase the representative pathogenic bacteria and <lb/>coliforms; however, cosupplementation of DDGS and xylanase could decrease the population <lb/>of coliforms in broiler chickens [27]. Coliforms could have a negative effect on gut microbial <lb/>ecology, and the decrease in the coliform population can be considered a more balanced <lb/>intestinal microecosystem with the improvement of beneficial bacteria [28]. In this study, all <lb/>kinds of exogenous enzymes could restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria such as coliforms <lb/>and Bacteroidetes. Additionally, this study proposed that MC2 supplementation could increase <lb/>the population of beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillus, in both the corn-SBM diet and DDGS diet, <lb/>and MC1 supplementation could upregulate the Lactobacillus population in only the corn-SBM <lb/>diet. In accordance with this study, Mountzouris et al. also demonstrated that β-galactosidase <lb/>supplementation could be attributed to the increased level of the Lactobacillus population [29]. <lb/>In addition, gut microbial modulation by Lactobacillus has a positive relationship with gut <lb/>immune homeostasis and defense systems [30]. These results proposed that dietary DDGS <lb/>could increase pathogenic bacteria and decrease beneficial bacteria populations; however, <lb/></body>

        <body>proper enzyme inclusion could reverse the population of the pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. <lb/>Alizadeh et al. demonstrated that dietary DDGS supplementation could destroy villus <lb/>morphology by upregulating immune responses [31]. However, Amer et al. also proposed that <lb/>dietary enzyme supplementation could restore gut histology [32]. These results were consistent <lb/>with our study; however, further studies will be needed to investigate the exact mode of action <lb/>of dietary exogenous enzymes. However, the gut mucus layer is important because it is the first <lb/>line of defense protecting the epithelium against luminal threats, including physical forces, <lb/>pathogens, and the gut microbiome [33]. Consistent with the results of this study, Alizadeh et <lb/>al. also demonstrated that dietary DDGS could demolish the mucus layer in the small intestine <lb/>[31]. However, the inclusion of enzymes restored the number of goblet cells. Walk and <lb/>colleagues also proposed that dietary enzyme supplementation could reconstruct the mucus <lb/>layer by the reestablishment of goblet cells [34]. <lb/>Dietary enzyme supplementation could improve gut immune status by strengthening <lb/>the gut mucosal layer and regulating inflammatory cytokine secretion. Min et al. demonstrated <lb/>that dietary DDGS supplementation could increase representative inflammatory cytokines such <lb/>as IL-1β and IL-6 [35]. In accordance with this study, our study also demonstrated that the <lb/>DDGS diet increased the populations of TGF-β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ; however, the expression <lb/>levels of the interleukin family members IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were conversely decreased by <lb/>DDGS supplementation. TGF-β is a major immune regulator in livestock animals, and dietary <lb/>DDGS supplementation significantly increased the expression level of TGF-β [36]. However, <lb/>dietary exogenous enzymes could decrease the level of TGF-β, and it might be a key mediator <lb/>leading to improved gut environments and growth performance. Additionally, MC1 in the <lb/>DDGS diet increased IL-4 and IL-6, and this result indicated that MC1 could regulate immune <lb/>responses in the jejunum by modulating the interleukin family. In the corn-SBM diet groups, <lb/></body>

        <body>SE decreased all kinds of inflammatory cytokine secretion, and this result could suggest that <lb/>SE in the corn-SBM diet is more suitable than MC for improving the immune status of broiler <lb/>chickens. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Dietary DDGS supplementation decreased growth; however, exogenous enzymes in a <lb/>DDGS-supplemented diet improved growth performance as much as the growth performance <lb/>of birds fed the corn-soy diet. In particular, exogenous enzymes could improve nutrient <lb/>digestibility by increasing villus height and the villus crypt ratio through the downregulation <lb/>of the key immune factor TGFβ. Additionally, dietary single enzyme and multienzyme complex <lb/>supplementation showed lower expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which might <lb/>be due to the improved gut defense system by increasing the number of mucin-secreting cells. <lb/>Collectively, the effects of dietary single enzymes and multienzyme complexes were similar, <lb/>and further studies will be needed to investigate the selection of enzymes that directly target <lb/>NSPs in feed ingredients. <lb/></body>
