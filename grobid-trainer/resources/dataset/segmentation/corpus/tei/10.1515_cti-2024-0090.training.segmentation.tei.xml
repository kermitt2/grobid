What qualities are important to consider <lb/>about the human experience when designing work tech-<lb/>nologies for the future? Exploring the potentials of artis-<lb/>tic practices for epistemological inquiry, we demonstrate <lb/>Research through Art as a novel futuring approach for <lb/>CSCW research, leveraging the power of artistic practice <lb/>for exploring questions of human experience. We engaged <lb/>with young artists who created art pieces that manifested <lb/>their hopes, intuitions, and anxieties on the future of work. <lb/>Our analytical inquiry of these artistic practices allowed us <lb/>to explore what different futures might be imaginable and <lb/>what might these futures feel like. We find that futuring <lb/>entails engaging with ambiguities, which can be a produc-<lb/>tive resource for design. We identified the ambiguities of <lb/>time, purpose, body, identity, and agency as foundational <lb/>for the imaginaries produced by the artists. By intersecting <lb/>the ambiguities, we can begin to systematically frame novel <lb/>design questions for CSCW technologies of the future by <lb/>conceptualizing these ambiguities as multifinalities -single <lb/>points from which many possibilities emerge. <lb/>Keywords: future of work; Research through Art; multifi-<lb/>nality; ambiguity; design; futuring <lb/></front>

        <body>you want, and it&apos;s not something you are captured in. [If] it&apos;s not <lb/>something that you really need because it&apos;s something that you <lb/>want to do. So it&apos;s like you&apos;re free.&quot; (artist interview, December <lb/>2022) <lb/>Traditional CSCW research is concerned with understand-<lb/>ing current work practices with the aim of designing new <lb/>technologies supporting these practices. 1,2 By implementing <lb/>new technologies, organizational members transform the <lb/>nature of the workplace, 1 enabling some activities while <lb/>constraining others. Thus, new cooperative technologies <lb/>create new technological futures for work. However, tech-<lb/>nological futures are not easily predictable, and CSCW <lb/>research has shown that to fully understand how new tech-<lb/>nologies impact work practices, we need access to observe <lb/>how practitioners adapt and transform their work practices <lb/>in relation to new technologies over time. As work is shift-<lb/>ing towards flexible employment, platform economies, and <lb/>hybrid work, 3-8 it is worth asking whose futures are being <lb/>made, who gets to decide, and how these changes impact our <lb/>lived experiences. What is a future of work where the meta-<lb/>verse is a routine workplace, or where bossware 9 becomes <lb/>an expected norm? <lb/>To explore such questions, traditional CSCW <lb/>approaches are inadequate, since they are focused on <lb/>what is currently here, rather than what will or should exist <lb/>in the future. To address this concern, contemporary CSCW <lb/>should explore and experiment with new methodological <lb/>approaches which challenge assumptions and ideas while <lb/>pushing the design of CSCW technologies into the future. <lb/>One such contemporary methodological approach is to <lb/>explore the potential of cross-fertilization between artistic <lb/>practices and CSCW design as Research through Art. We <lb/>propose Research through Art as an epistemic form of <lb/>inquiry for CSCW research, which is not about making <lb/>artists design technologies, 10 nor is it about Research <lb/>through Design. 11 Instead, engaging with Research through <lb/>Art as an approach to CSCW futuring is about broadening <lb/>our understanding of a qualitative phenomenon or concept <lb/>-in our case the future of work. <lb/>Research through Art as an approach to CSCW research <lb/>complements existing efforts of futuring through specula-<lb/>tive and critical design. 12,13 Speculative and critical design <lb/>research has introduced many productive approaches for <lb/>thinking about and exploring technological futures as a <lb/></body>

        <body>way to critique current technologies and to inform future <lb/>technology design. Yet as Haraway 14 and Suchman 15 remind <lb/>us, knowledge is always made &quot;from somewhere&quot; in situ-<lb/>ated practice. Futures are also imagined and made within <lb/>the same geography of knowing. Louise Amoore 16 calls the <lb/>attempt to use imagined futures to inform decisions &quot;a pol-<lb/>itics of possibility,&quot; warning that no matter how creatively <lb/>we might want to imagine the future, it is always defined <lb/>by the patterns of our past. Thus, futuring as a practice of <lb/>informing design risks being fraught with problematic past <lb/>assumptions and taken-for-granted knowledge. We attempt <lb/>to push forward CSCW&apos;s traditional focus on existing work <lb/>practices, emphasizing exploration of the qualitative and <lb/>ambiguous human experience of work to augment the prac-<lb/>tical foundations of CSCW, so that we can embrace ambi-<lb/>guities in the creation of work futures as the ground for <lb/>technology design. We do this by utilizing artistic practices <lb/>as the epistemological approach, engaging with artists on <lb/>the topic of work. <lb/>We asked a group of young-adult artists to explore the <lb/>future of work through their artistic practice, creating art <lb/>pieces that allowed them to manifest their hopes, intuitions, <lb/>and anxieties on this subject. We used the artists&apos; artistic <lb/>practices, meaning the art pieces they produced as the result <lb/>of deeply engaging with the topic, in combination with the <lb/>articulations about the art pieces by the artists themselves, <lb/>to identify which epistemological directions they volunteer <lb/>for CSCW as exploration mechanisms for the future of work. <lb/>Analyzing the artistic practices, we ask: What qualities are <lb/>important to consider about the human experience in the <lb/>future of work? <lb/>The result of our analytical inquiry includes not what <lb/>singular future someone might be able to imagine, but <lb/>rather what possibilities of different futures might be imag-<lb/>inable and what might they feel like. Imagining futures is a <lb/>process necessarily fraught with ambiguities. However, in <lb/>line with Gaver, we found that such ambiguities can become <lb/>an important resource in design. 17 We identified five main <lb/>ambiguities (time, purpose, body, identity, and agency) that <lb/>underpinned the imaginaries the artists produced as a col-<lb/>lective. We view each ambiguity as a continuum of potential <lb/>futures, and by intersecting the ambiguities into a mesh, we <lb/>can pull certain stories about the qualities of human experi-<lb/>ences apart from others, following the threads similarly to <lb/>when Donna Haraway pulled strings out of a tangled ball of <lb/>yarn as a metaphor for unpacking the multiplicity of mean-<lb/>ings that comprise modern culture. 18 We argue that exam-<lb/>ining artistic practices as a methodological approach allows <lb/>us to systematically frame novel design questions for CSCW <lb/>technologies of the future. Strings of questions, pulled from <lb/>the mesh, can be understood as multifinalities (single points <lb/>from which many possible futures can emerge), 19 allowing <lb/>ambiguities to entwine and enable structured explorations <lb/>of a new type of design space for the future of work. <lb/>This paper makes two primary contributions. First, we <lb/>demonstrate the value in engaging an alternative approach <lb/>to futuring in contemporary CSCW research, that seeks to <lb/>evoke hopes and anxieties by taking artistic practice seri-<lb/>ously as an epistemic process. Second, we offer a discussion <lb/>of five key ambiguities of human experience in the future <lb/>of work, and demonstrate a way for designers of CSCW <lb/>technologies to structure inquiry on this topic through the <lb/>exploration of these ambiguities as multifinalities. In this <lb/>way, we produce a mesh of intersecting agenda to explore <lb/>continuums of ambiguities, challenging and opening up the <lb/>design space of the future of work. <lb/>In the remainder of the paper, we first situate our work <lb/>within contemporary CSCW research, and describe how we <lb/>are extending the CSCW agenda. We then introduce our <lb/>method -particularly how we engaged with and analysed <lb/>artistic explorations. We follow Gaver et al. 20 presenting our <lb/>findings as annotated portfolios, demonstrating five types <lb/>of ambiguity pertaining to the human experience of work. <lb/>Finally, using the example of a recent case study of phys-<lb/>iotherapists practicing remote medicine by Sergeeva, 21 we <lb/>demonstrate how our results can be used to extend exist-<lb/>ing CSCW research. We discuss how these ambiguities are <lb/>intertwined and connected -and how paying attention to <lb/>these can create new possibilities for design explorations for <lb/>future technologies. <lb/>2 Situating human experience <lb/>in contemporary CSCW research <lb/>We are making three agential shifts in CSCW by identifying <lb/>and exploring qualities of human experience in contem-<lb/>porary CSCW research. The first shift is from focusing on <lb/>the mechanics of cooperative work towards focusing on the <lb/>human experience of work. The second shift is from a focus <lb/>on understanding current cooperative practices towards <lb/>focusing on futuring. The third shift is from considering <lb/>merit in CSCW as centering efficiency and productivity, <lb/>towards recognizing merit in exploring ambiguities. We will <lb/>visit each shift in turn below. <lb/>2.1 From mechanics of cooperative work <lb/>to human experience <lb/>CSCW research has traditionally focused on identifying <lb/>important concepts about cooperative work, which can <lb/></body>

        <body>help inform the design of cooperative technologies. 1,2 This <lb/>research has centered around a detailed understanding <lb/>of different and complex work practices, as conceptual <lb/>work is a long-term CSCW research endeavor. Such concept-<lb/>oriented focus in CSCW research has most often been devel-<lb/>oped through in-depth ethnographic studies of work prac-<lb/>tices 22,23 producing insights about aspects of cooperative <lb/>work such as awareness, 24 coordination, 25 and knowledge. 26 <lb/>The work most often takes its starting point in the funda-<lb/>mental difference between work and articulation work, and <lb/>then identifies different ways in which practitioners man-<lb/>age to align, coordinate, and interrelate their complex work <lb/>practices using technologies. In this way, CSCW research <lb/>centers around the basic understandings of what work <lb/>entails by zooming in on practices, artefacts, activities, and <lb/>technologies. 27 -29 <lb/>While CSCW has developed deep theoretical knowl-<lb/>edge about the mechanics of cooperative work, there is a <lb/>lack of research that zooms out to consider work as part <lb/>of a broader human affective experience. Exploring which <lb/>qualities of the human experience of work we should con-<lb/>sider when we design CSCW technologies is rarely the main <lb/>focus of CSCW studies, however, the existential experience <lb/>of work has been included as a factor in some contem-<lb/>porary CSCW research. For example, research on global <lb/>work has shown that &quot;being a software developer&quot; means <lb/>something different depending on where in the world this <lb/>work is performed, even if the mechanics and goals of <lb/>the job are very similar. 30 -33 The interest in human expe-<lb/>rience in CSCW has thus begun to enter the concerns <lb/>that CSCW researchers have when designing technologies, <lb/>since clearly specific design might produce barriers which <lb/>are counter-productive to the nature of the work. 34,35 Fur-<lb/>ther, CSCW reveals how the actual detailed work required <lb/>to get work done is often invisible from afar, leading to <lb/>the risk of dehumanization. 36,37 These experiential aspects <lb/>of work deserve further study in the field, and we con-<lb/>tribute here an exploration focused specifically on this <lb/>topic. <lb/>If we are to fully create cooperative technologies span-<lb/>ning boundaries and facilitating cooperation across the <lb/>global north and the global south, we have to include the <lb/>holistic human experience of work into the mix. However, <lb/>until now only little CSCW research considers or reflects <lb/>upon what working feels like as part of daily life. Thus, the <lb/>first shift we suggest is to expand the scope of CSCW inquiry <lb/>beyond the cooperative mechanics of work to include focus <lb/>on the human experience of work. <lb/>2.2 From contemporary practice towards <lb/>futuring <lb/>Besides the shift towards human experiences, the authors <lb/>also take another turn in this research: namely to move <lb/>away from current work practices as the main concern, <lb/>towards future work practices as central for our work. In <lb/>CSCW, the majority of research exploring the conceptual <lb/>nature of cooperative work is done through ethnographic <lb/>studies or workplace studies. These approaches have been <lb/>demonstrated to be excellent vehicles allowing for detailed <lb/>ethnographic description which serves as the background <lb/>for theoretical conceptualization. However, we are shifting <lb/>our focus beyond the current work as it is accomplished <lb/>within organizations today, and looking toward the poten-<lb/>tial futures of work. The systematic approach to exploring <lb/>alternate futures is commonly referred to as futuring. <lb/>Technologists and researchers have embraced some <lb/>well-established futuring practices such as design fic-<lb/>tion 38 -40 and speculative design. 41 There are also exam-<lb/>ples of futuring methods with connections to traditional <lb/>CSCW research methods, such as fictional ethnography, 42 <lb/>ethnographic experiential futures, 43,44 participatory spec-<lb/>ulative design, 45 and participatory futuring. 46 These have <lb/>been shown to be interesting and useful design-oriented <lb/>methods, using the design of fictional or speculative arti-<lb/>facts from a narrative imagined future as the primary tool <lb/>of investigation. <lb/>Our attempt in this paper is complementary to these <lb/>design approaches. An important difference is our interest <lb/>in finding ways to do futuring which are a priori: as a way <lb/>to inform meaningful design intentions before design. All <lb/>design inquiries are iterative, however design activities can <lb/>still have different connotations and dedications, such as <lb/>the work on use-before-use, design-before-use, design-after-<lb/>use, etc. by Bjögvinsson et al. 47 Our interest is to provide <lb/>a way for CSCW designers to take a step back and engage <lb/>in epistemological futuring inquiry prior to design. This <lb/>ensures that we keep the field of concern productively open, <lb/>rather than risk closing it down prematurely and jumping <lb/>straight to solutions. By embracing the expansiveness of the <lb/>human experience more deeply when we design for the <lb/>future, we might better avoid the pitfall of heedlessly using <lb/>the same tools to solve a problem that created the problem <lb/>in the first place. When conceptualizing and navigating this <lb/>expansive futuring practice for CSCW, we follow the threads <lb/>of multifinalities. <lb/>The concept of multifinality was introduced by Berta-<lb/>lanffy in General System Theory 19 to describe how one event <lb/></body>

        <body>may lead to multiple outcomes (in contrast to equifinality, <lb/>where multiple events may lead to the same outcome.) The <lb/>notion of multifinality was appropriated in social psychol-<lb/>ogy by Kruglanski 48 to describe motivated cognition, where <lb/>&quot;a single behavior is performed in the service of multi-<lb/>ple goals&quot;. 49 This term was also used by communications <lb/>scholar Sillars 50 to describe how the same communication <lb/>strategy may result in different consequences depending on <lb/>the context in the relationship between parties. We intro-<lb/>duce the concept of multifinality to CSCW for the ways <lb/>in which we think about futuring practices. Multifinalities <lb/>allow us to acknowledge that many different futures can <lb/>be designed based on what we know right now. We find <lb/>the concept of multifinality useful in our futuring practice <lb/>for describing prompts that have the power to spawn many <lb/>possible futures. <lb/>We can imagine an infinite number of futures from <lb/>our starting points in the present, and it can be a daunting <lb/>challenge to decide which of these future imaginings will <lb/>matter. As such, we turn to the work of Elsden et al. 51 and <lb/>their focus on consequentiality in their futuring approach of <lb/>speculative enactments. When faced with an overwhelming <lb/>multiplicity of possible futures, they argue it is necessary <lb/>to ground these futures with consequences in the present, <lb/>through material or social engagement, to maintain the use-<lb/>fulness of the futuring practice. Without consequentiality, <lb/>futures can become untethered, abstract, and meaningless. <lb/>While Elsden et al. work to generate circumstances where <lb/>elements matter to their participants as they imagine differ-<lb/>ent futures, our approach focused on embedding the idea of <lb/>the future of work into artistic process, where the creation <lb/>of an art piece as a way of imagining a future in itself <lb/>becomes consequential. <lb/>Thus, our contemporary CSCW approach is not only <lb/>to focus on human experience (rather than mechanics of <lb/>cooperative work), we also focus on how to produce mul-<lb/>tifinalities as part of futuring (before-design and beyond <lb/>ethnographic studies). The third shift we enact concerns <lb/>what counts as meritorious in design for cooperative work. <lb/>2.3 From valuing efficiency to valuing <lb/>ambiguity <lb/>Focusing on the mechanics of cooperative work using ethno-<lb/>graphic studies most often results in design-oriented inter-<lb/>ests, developing and defining merit in CSCW technologies as <lb/>centering the aim of reducing efforts of articulation work. <lb/>When we shift our focus towards human experience and <lb/>futuring, we also need to shift our intention and under-<lb/>standing of merit in design. We therefore shift our focus <lb/>from reducing the efforts of articulation work (and thus <lb/>achieving efficiency and productivity) as meritorious ambi-<lb/>tions, to recognizing the value of ambiguities in defining the <lb/>ambitions for CSCW design spaces. <lb/>Researchers agree that dedication to ambiguity when <lb/>futuring is a cornerstone for such ventures. There is inher-<lb/>ent ambiguity in imagining consequential futures, but <lb/>which ambiguities become prominent and how we might <lb/>employ them can be an important insight. The advantages <lb/>of ambiguity have been well documented in research. The <lb/>merit of allowing &quot;uncertainty&quot; to exist outside of neatly <lb/>quantifiable scientific control was eloquently argued by <lb/>Gaver et al. 52 in their use of cultural probes in the early <lb/>2000s. Moreover, Gaver et al. 17 identified three types of <lb/>ambiguity in human-computer interaction (information, <lb/>context, and relationship) and detailed tactics for using <lb/>these types of ambiguity in HCI design. Highlighting the <lb/>persistence of the tendency to over-rationalize qualitative <lb/>ambiguities in research, in 2016 Blythe and Encinas 53 argued <lb/>for the value of ambiguity, asserting that much futuring <lb/>research has the pitfall of being &quot;scientistic,&quot; meaning that <lb/>it is artificially and needlessly construed as scientific rather <lb/>than left to stand on its own genuine merits. <lb/>Leveraging ambiguity is also a strategy for reject-<lb/>ing solutionism in design work, 54 embracing the absurdist <lb/>potential of fictions, unuseless artifacts, and silly design to <lb/>explore questions. This strategy is also explored in coun-<lb/>terfunctional design such as the Zoom Obscura project by <lb/>Elsden et al., 10 which subverted the function of video con-<lb/>ferencing software to explore themes of agency and per-<lb/>sonal privacy. In another example of applying ambiguity in <lb/>research, Sanches et al. 55 illustrated how scaffolding ambi-<lb/>guities during an intentionally open phase of a design pro-<lb/>cess can lead to a richness of interpretations and new prac-<lb/>tices in a given field (in their case, biodata tracking). This <lb/>hearkens back to the argument by Sengers and Gaver 56 <lb/>for strategically encouraging and embracing flexibility and <lb/>ambiguity in the form of multiple and even contradictory <lb/>user interpretations in the design and evaluation of HCI sys-<lb/>tems. A recent example of this strategy is the Beatfield musi-<lb/>cal device by Masu et al. 57 and subsequent case study by <lb/>Morreale et al. 58 exploring appropriation in open-meaning <lb/>interaction design. In another recent study, Gatehouse and <lb/>Chatting interrogated the benefits and challenges of grap-<lb/>pling with ambiguity via inarticulacy while hacking net-<lb/>work technologies in a Research through Design practice. 59 <lb/>While ambiguity has been thoroughly explored as a <lb/>research and design resource in HCI more broadly, as <lb/>shown in the examples above, CSCW research has remained <lb/>largely concerned with mitigating or resolving ambiguities: <lb/>answering questions, describing phenomena, and solving <lb/></body>

        <body>problems in the domain of work and cooperation. These <lb/>goals have obvious value, however we look to extend the <lb/>scope of the knowledge informing such practical CSCW <lb/>research with the inclusion of the unquantifiable experien-<lb/>tial parts of work. Qualitative human experience, which is <lb/>important to understand in the domain of work and cooper-<lb/>ation, is not a problem to be solved but rather a dimension <lb/>to be explored. We look to Haraway, and argue that &quot;staying <lb/>with the trouble&quot; 60 and engaging with these open-ended <lb/>ambiguities to construct a more nuanced awareness of the <lb/>existential aspects of work can have benefits for research <lb/>and design in CSCW. <lb/>Following the work on ambiguity as a feature of futur-<lb/>ing, while combining the interest in work and work prac-<lb/>tices from CSCW, our approach can be considered as artistic <lb/>futuring towards extending current conceptual research in <lb/>CSCW concerning work, with the aim of producing a set <lb/>of questions and tactics which CSCW researchers need to <lb/>explore if we are to take active part in developing a future <lb/>of work which might look different than the past of work. <lb/>3 Methods <lb/>We incorporated Research through Art alongside standard CSCW <lb/>research methodologies, and below we describe the empirical context <lb/>for our study, detail our data sources and data collection methods, and <lb/>introduce our data analysis process and presentation of the data in the <lb/>form of annotated portfolios. We conclude the section with an introduc-<lb/>tion to the art pieces featured in this paper, as well as a positionality and <lb/>limitations statement. <lb/>3.1 Research through Art <lb/>In order to understand what qualities are important to consider about <lb/>the human experience in constructing the futures of work in contempo-<lb/>rary CSCW, we engaged with artists as a means to explore what different <lb/>kinds of futures might feel like. Thus, we utilized artistic practices as a <lb/>means to learn about human experience as a quality of work. Not all <lb/>research involving artists or the arts is necessarily Research through <lb/>Art as we are defining it. There are multiple examples of research <lb/>encompassing co-design with artists, design of systems and products <lb/>for use by artists, and interaction design for art-related experiences <lb/>such as museums or theatrical events. When we refer to Research <lb/>through Art, however, it is not design research, and is not simply any <lb/>research related to art. Instead, we propose Research through Art as <lb/>artistic approaches, methods, and processes (or artistic practices) used <lb/>as epistemic forms of conceptual inquiry. We collected data through <lb/>more traditional approaches such as observations and interviews to <lb/>capture the details and nuances of the artistic practices. <lb/>Artists are an especially relevant group for researchers to col-<lb/>laborate with on subjects such as human experience, because skillful <lb/>artistic practice entails divergent deep thinking about existential topics. <lb/>This specific expertise afforded by artists offers considerable insights, <lb/>and is currently under-utilized in CSCW research. There is precedent <lb/>for productive CSCW collaborations with other non-CSCW designers <lb/>and participants (many examples of this exist). Research through Art <lb/>is another instance in the tradition of cross-disciplinary collaboration, <lb/>however, we emphasize that if we are specifically seeking to leverage <lb/>artistic practice as a legitimate form of inquiry, it is important to recog-<lb/>nize artistic practice as a legitimate field of expertise and to work with <lb/>qualified artists. This may include professional artists as well as people <lb/>deeply engaged in the serious study of artistic practice, as presented in <lb/>this study. <lb/>Artistic practices have been shown to contribute knowledge about <lb/>concepts and phenomena of inquiry for tech design. For example, in <lb/>the field of interactive technology design, Sarah Fdili Alaoui 61 demon-<lb/>strates knowledge-making through iterative choreographic dance prac-<lb/>tice with the use of technology mapping live biometric data to outputs <lb/>of sound and video, questioning the relationships between technology, <lb/>art, and human experience. Jones et al. 62 used performance art to <lb/>investigate how algorithmic systems fail to understand or account for <lb/>human bodies, by studying ways that artists interpreted performance <lb/>instructions generated by GPT-3. The results of their research describe <lb/>the ways that artists make sense of and relate to algorithmic systems. <lb/>Holmer et al. 63 focus on the conceptual understanding of participatory <lb/>design, by studying an instance of environmentalist participatory art at <lb/>a festival, identifying the strategies used by the artists to engage partic-<lb/>ipants, and observing the ways that participation was encouraged and <lb/>inhibited by the context of the art interventions. They apply this knowl-<lb/>edge to case studies in HCI to inform the use of participatory strate-<lb/>gies in future research. Kang et al. 64 applied theories of improvisation <lb/>from art and music to extend methodologies for design, identifying the <lb/>concept of &quot;intermodulation&quot; as a tool of inquiry across disciplines. <lb/>Finally, in the Zoom Obscura project, Elsden et al. 10 engaged with artists <lb/>using counterfunctional design to explore and challenge the norms and <lb/>culture permeating the use of videoconferencing technology. <lb/>We complement existing research on art interventions and design <lb/>for artists in CSCW by contributing research with artists -proposing <lb/>Research through Art as a methodological approach which is well <lb/>suited to exploring the experiential and existential aspects of work in <lb/>contemporary CSCW research. Thus, we extend the CSCW toolkit with <lb/>the inclusion of epistemic artistic research as a futuring practice. We do <lb/>this with the aim of including human experience into CSCW modes of <lb/>inquiry as complementary to studies of the mechanics of cooperative <lb/>work. <lb/>3.2 The empirical setting <lb/>The data for this study comes from research activities in the fall of 2022 <lb/>with a group of young adult artists. The project engaged with a 2-month <lb/>long art school course at BGK ArtLab in Denmark, providing the theme <lb/>of the future of work as the foundation for the course. The artists in the <lb/>course worked with the instructors to explore ideas around the topic. <lb/>As the major output from the course, the artists produced art pieces <lb/>for a themed public exhibition at the arts and culture organization <lb/>that was part of organizing the course. In total 13 students showed art <lb/>about the future of work at their exhibition, and 5 of those students <lb/>volunteered to participate in interviews. Our research involvement <lb/>in this process included planning sessions with the facilitators of the <lb/>student art exhibition, visiting some of the artists&apos; work sessions during <lb/>the course to talk with them and to observe their process, attending <lb/>the opening night of their exhibition, and then conducting group and <lb/>individual interviews with a subset of five artists. <lb/></body>

        <body>We extended the invitation to interview with us to the entire <lb/>class (an ask for extra time from the artists) which we relayed through <lb/>the instructor of the course, and five (aged 17-24, three women, two <lb/>men) agreed to participate, as well as granting us permission to use <lb/>their words and photos of their work here. All of the participants <lb/>intended to make art in their future lives, but not all were convinced <lb/>that they would have a future career exclusively in the fine arts, with <lb/>some describing other interests and possibilities as well. All of our <lb/>participants had some kind of work or volunteer experience at the <lb/>time of the interviews, describing retail jobs in grocery and hardware <lb/>stores, service jobs in bars and restaurants, farming and gardening, <lb/>cleaning, being an assistant sports coach, and working in a mini golf <lb/>park. The younger participants predictably had less time and experi-<lb/>ence working in jobs, but the older ones described as many as six years <lb/>of work experience in various settings. However, all of the participants <lb/>we interviewed were still relatively unconcerned with the traditional <lb/>conventions of how things are supposed to be and therefore in a unique <lb/>position to freely imagine other possible futures and ways of working <lb/>and living. <lb/>The artists engaged the future of work together through discussion <lb/>and artistic practice in regular sessions in their art school course for <lb/>two months. They produced art pieces about work in many forms of <lb/>media, including paintings, drawings, mixed media works, sculptures, <lb/>videos, animations, digital art, and written words. Through their art <lb/>and interviews, the artists expressed complex and thoughtful ideas <lb/>about the future of work. They articulated hopes and desires while also <lb/>expressing fears, anxieties, and doubts about whether the futures they <lb/>wanted would be possible or achievable. <lb/>3.3 Data sources and collection <lb/>The data set for this study includes photos and memo notes from plan-<lb/>ning meetings and researcher visits to the artists&apos; work sessions, photos <lb/>and video of the finished art pieces and the exhibit space, written <lb/>statements from some of the artists that accompanied their art pieces <lb/>(not all of the artists chose to exhibit written statements with their <lb/>pieces), and recorded semi-structured group and individual interviews <lb/>with five participants. As we have the richest data about the art works <lb/>created by the interview participants, these are the works we present <lb/>in our results in this paper; however, the qualitative analysis included <lb/>all of the art in the exhibition. The data sources and participant infor-<lb/>mation are detailed in Table 1, and this subset of five art pieces are <lb/>introduced in Figure 1 and described below in 3.5. The methods used <lb/>in this research adhere to the ethical guidelines of the University of <lb/>Copenhagen. All photos published here were taken by the authors, at <lb/>the public exhibition, and are shared, including the titles of the works, <lb/>with the permission of the artists. <lb/>The interviews took place in one day, in the exhibit space allowing <lb/>participants to directly see and reference the finished art pieces as <lb/>part of the conversation. All interviews were conducted in English. <lb/>The group discussion was 30 min long, and prompted each artist to <lb/>briefly introduce their pieces, followed by discussion of their creation <lb/>processes, the intended meanings behind the art, what they thought <lb/>was important for others to know about it, and making comparisons <lb/>and connections. The artists had been working together on site for the <lb/>duration of the course, they were already familiar with each other&apos;s <lb/>work, and the researcher had also already attended the exhibition and <lb/>had also interacted with the artists previously. This allowed us to keep <lb/>the introductions to the pieces brief and spend most of the time in dis-<lb/>cussion. The individual interviews were 10-15 min long (being longer <lb/>with participants with more extensive work histories) and focused <lb/>specifically on the topic of work and its futures. The art pieces were <lb/>sometimes mentioned by the interviewer or participant as a point of <lb/>reference or explanatory device in the individual interviews, to illus-<lb/>trate a statement, expression, or complex concept, but unlike the group <lb/>interview, the art pieces were not the main focus of these discussions. <lb/>The individual interview protocol contained questions about their past <lb/>and current experiences with work, their fantasies and hopes for the <lb/>Table 1: Data sources. <lb/>Research activity <lb/>Data type <lb/>Description <lb/>Project planning <lb/>Notes, emails, slideshow <lb/>Researcher 2 and BGK ArtLab <lb/>Work session visit 1 <lb/>Notes, photos <lb/>Researcher 2 <lb/>Work session visit 2 <lb/>Notes, photos <lb/>Researcher 2 <lb/>Work session visit 3 <lb/>Notes, photos <lb/>Researcher 1 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>Fremtidens Dominans sculpture by P1 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos <lb/>Fremtidens Dominans statement card by P1 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>The Future Homunculus sculpture by P2 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>The 4 Levels of Freedom sculpture by P3 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos <lb/>The 4 Levels of Freedom artist statement by P3 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>Furry Supremacy digital art prints by P4 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>Proces video by P5 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos <lb/>Proces artist statement by P5 <lb/>Art exhibit <lb/>Photos, videos <lb/>Art pieces and statements by 8 other artists <lb/>Group interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 <lb/>Individual interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P1, age 17 <lb/>Individual interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P2, age 17 <lb/>Individual interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P3, age 24 <lb/>Individual interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P4, age 21 <lb/>Individual interview <lb/>Audio, notes <lb/>P5, age 18 <lb/></body>

These were not questions about what tasks they will do at work, <lb/>rather they were questions about what it could be like to be a working <lb/>person. We concluded with open invitations to share any other thoughts <lb/>or information they deemed relevant. <lb/>By the time of the interviews, the artists had been working <lb/>together and thinking on this topic for an extended period of time <lb/>(two months) and had well-developed thoughts and feelings on the <lb/>subject. They held complex opinions and ideas about the topic and <lb/>could imagine many futures. Art affords a freedom from the con-<lb/>straints of what is actionable, literal, or realistic, and this means that <lb/>there is room to unpack complicated feelings and concepts without <lb/>the mandate of identifying a problem and devising a solution in the <lb/>same conversation. The artists understood that exploring the topic and <lb/>being expressive about it was the entirety of what they were there <lb/>to do. The researcher verbally set the expectations for the interviews <lb/>with the participants by emphasizing that there were no good or bad, <lb/>right or wrong answers, and that our interest was to document their <lb/>thoughts, ideas, experiences, and opinions on the subject which they <lb/>had explored quite deeply through their artistic processes. The insights <lb/>that these artists shared with us in their art and their words are not <lb/>limited to a particular job or type of work, but instead extend the <lb/>conversations about the basic nature of future jobs or workspaces. <lb/>The audio recordings of interviews were transcribed with Otter.ai <lb/>software and then manually corrected by the interviewing researcher. <lb/>The written artist statements were translated from Danish to English <lb/>with Google Translate, and all translations were checked and corrected <lb/>by a native Danish speaker. <lb/>3.4 Data analysis and annotated portfolios <lb/>All of the data were uploaded into MaxQDA qualitative data anal-<lb/>ysis software, and the data originating from the artists (photos <lb/>and descriptions of art, statements, interview transcriptions) were <lb/>coded with an initial set of 15 a priori codes developed to capture <lb/></body>

        <note place="headnote">-K. Dunn et al.: What Research through Art can bring to CSCW <lb/></note>

        <body>positive/neutral/negative statements, descriptions of work experiences, <lb/>and particular values that appeared prominent in the exhibition and <lb/>interviews. Examples of codes were: enjoyment, security, respect, and <lb/>descriptions of physicality such as body and work environment. We ini-<lb/>tiated our analytical process with an open-ended approach focusing on <lb/>identifying experiences, imaginaries, wants and needs as experessed <lb/>across the data material. We added inductive codes to the codebook <lb/>while analyzing the data, e.g. we annotated all mentions of money, time, <lb/>and additional values and attitudes. The next step in the data analysis <lb/>included inductive refinement and reorganization of codes into sub-<lb/>codes, resulting in a final codebook of 36 unique codes and subcodes. <lb/>The remaining uncoded data (from project planning and researcher <lb/>notes) was organized and referred back to for context in data anal-<lb/>ysis and researcher discussions. Through thematic analysis and iter-<lb/>ative analytical discussions, we noticed a pattern of contradictions <lb/>and ambiguities that were contained within the overarching themes <lb/>in the dataset. Thus our analysis of the artistic practices unveiled the <lb/>qualities of human experience as shaped by dimensions of ambiguity. <lb/>Reconsidering and comparing the dimensions, we ultimately organized <lb/>them under the headings of time, purpose, body, identity, and agency, <lb/>which we describe in detail in the next section. <lb/>The dimensions of ambiguity were then combined with the photos <lb/>and the words of the artists and organized in virtual whiteboards on <lb/>Miro.com to create annotated portfolios 20 to document and present the <lb/>results of the research. Annotated portfolios are a recognized format <lb/>used by artists and designers for presenting, critiquing, and document-<lb/>ing the outputs of their creative work, and have been established as <lb/>useful in HCI research. 43,65-69 Rather than a prescriptive or &quot;scientistic&quot; <lb/>presentation, the annotated portfolio captures artifacts, ideas, and the <lb/>relationships between them, in a way that leaves space for discussion <lb/>and expansion. We are extending Gaver&apos;s version of the annotated <lb/>portfolio by documenting not only the artifacts and artists&apos; words, but <lb/>also the input of the researchers with the inclusion of the themes from <lb/>our qualitative analysis. By making such a combination, we insist on the <lb/>cooperative engagement between artists and researchers to be part of <lb/>the productive nature of Research through Art in contemporary CSCW <lb/>research. The open-ended and conceptual aspects of the annotated <lb/>portfolio concept make it an appropriate format for capturing the <lb/>results of our collaborative artistic futuring process. The negotiation, <lb/>discussion, and reflection would not have existed about the future of <lb/>work, if we as researchers had not collaborated with the art course <lb/>organizers and young artists. It was only through these interactions <lb/>that the qualities of human experience were identified as dimensions <lb/>of ambiguities for the future of work. <lb/>3.5 Art pieces by the interview participants <lb/>The art works created by our interview participants are detailed in <lb/>Figure 1. We introduce them here to add context to our findings in the <lb/>next section. <lb/>1. The 4 Levels of Freedom is a four-part sculpture created by P3. It <lb/>presents four roughly life-sized head-and-shoulders of a worker in <lb/>four alternate futures, each differing based on how much of the <lb/>future worker&apos;s life is devoted to -and consumed by -their job. In <lb/>a one-page written statement accompanying the set of sculptures, <lb/>the artist has introduced the set with this text: &quot;. . . a work in <lb/>four parts, each of which represents a possible future. Each future <lb/>tells the story of how humanity is willing to sell itself to achieve <lb/>something greater. Whether it is materialistic ideals or prestige. We <lb/>are all willing to sell our time for something. Time is the only thing <lb/>we own that cannot be taken from us.&quot; [Translated from Danish] <lb/>Each part of the set is named: Free (right), For Rent (left), Owned <lb/>(center bottom), and Sold (center top). <lb/>2. Fremtidens Dominans (&quot;Future Dominance&quot; in English) is a sculp-<lb/>ture and accompanying postcard by P1. The sculpture features a <lb/>tall tower in the middle of an abstract cityscape made of black <lb/>painted blocks. The tower has a representation of smoke coming <lb/>out of the top of it, and wires connecting it to each block in the <lb/>cityscape, representing a panoptic surveillance state. The card is a <lb/>greyscale image of an urban scene with tall buildings and vehicles, <lb/>with red letters superimposed that read: &quot;FUTURE DOMINANCE. <lb/>The dominant future of the so-called rat race. The dominant <lb/>monopoly that controls everything with a pulse, a metropolis that <lb/>cannot be tamed by the individuals. Dominance over the animal <lb/>world. A director that dominates regardless of the conditions. A <lb/>hidden dictatorial system. An inflation of corruption.&quot; [translated <lb/>from Danish] <lb/>3. The Future Homunculus sculpture by P2 is approximately the size <lb/>of a small child and stands on the floor. It has a very large head <lb/>with exaggerated ears and enormous compound eyes, atop a small <lb/>body. The hands are disproportionately large and have only two <lb/>big fingers each, and the feet are shaped like boots with no toes. <lb/>The artist&apos;s choice of the word &quot;homunculus&quot; in the title of the <lb/>piece evokes the historic meaning of the word as a representation <lb/>of a small person, as well as the use of the word as part of the <lb/>famous &quot;cortical homunculus&quot; illustrations of a human with the <lb/>body parts shrunk or enlarged to represent how much area of <lb/>the brain is dedicated to each part. This Future Homunculus has <lb/>its body parts distorted according to the artist&apos;s speculation about <lb/>how our patterns of technology use could affect our bodies in the <lb/>future. <lb/>4. Furry Supremacy is a series of four digital art prints created by P4 <lb/>using 3D modeling software. Each print shows a greyscale head <lb/>and neck of a different fantastical creature, against a black back-<lb/>ground. The creatures have features that evoke ambiguous animal, <lb/>alien, and even mystical aesthetics. They are offered as possible <lb/>digital avatars, ways to present ourselves in a future digital world <lb/>that allows for an expanded idea of who -and what -we could be <lb/>in a work environment. <lb/>5. Proces is a video by P5, which shows the artist&apos;s hands using scis-<lb/>sors to cut apart a large piece of reddish-brown fabric, and then <lb/>sewing the fabric back together into one piece along two random <lb/>edges with thick black thread. The video does not contain sound, <lb/>and it is set to loop, with the gentle, methodical cutting apart and <lb/>stitching together of the fabric never stopping or resulting in an <lb/>identifiable finished product. The artist included a written state-<lb/>ment in the exhibition, which says: &quot;The work shows an endless <lb/>process without an end point. The fabric that is sewn and cut again <lb/>and again shows the aim or product sought for. In today&apos;s society <lb/>it is growth that is the most valuable factor in success. You will <lb/>see achievements and results are expected, rather than immersion <lb/>and curiosity. What is our goal? In the future, growth has been <lb/>abolished, and work may still have an impact on society, but it <lb/>primarily is meaningful to the person who does the work. The <lb/>process will be in focus and those things that have value will be <lb/>what drives passion.&quot; [Translated from Danish] <lb/></body>

        <body>3.6 Positionality and limitations <lb/>The first author has a background which includes university level arts <lb/>education as a student and teacher, as well career experience in the fine <lb/>arts; the other authors also draw from expertise in CSCW, education, <lb/>and art history. This study occurred in Denmark, and consequently the <lb/>researchers and participants all come from a place of western privilege, <lb/>and our results should be viewed in that context. <lb/>As with all qualitative research, our analysis of the data cannot <lb/>be divorced from our positionality as adult researchers rather than <lb/>peers of the participants. The inclusion of the artists&apos; own commen-<lb/>tary on their peers&apos; work (in the interview data) is one attempt to <lb/>expand the scope of viewpoints captured in our data set. Additionally, <lb/>all interpretations of art are inevitably subjective, with no singular <lb/>&quot;correct&quot; interpretation being possible. Without going too far down the <lb/>rabbit hole of art criticism and theory, we have attempted to embrace <lb/>an open-minded multiplicity of interpretations and viewpoints in our <lb/>analysis, as well as in our presentation of these art works and the other <lb/>expressions of the artists in this study. Like all instances of artistic <lb/>interpretation and qualitative research, our results are not exhaustive. <lb/>Focused artistic practice and arts education are well placed for <lb/>exploring existential qualitative human experiences, however our <lb/>methods are not necessarily suited to the practical investigation of spe-<lb/>cific jobs or work practices, and must be applied to the right questions. <lb/>The dimensions of ambiguity we offer can be used to interrogate the <lb/>existential aspects of any field of work (we demonstrate with the case <lb/>of physiotherapy in 5.1) because these ambiguities are ultimately about <lb/>people, not about tasks. For example, it would not make sense to use <lb/>art to analyze the communication patterns in a hospital emergency <lb/>room (and there already exist well-developed CSCW methods for this <lb/>question) but it does make sense to use artistic practice to capture the <lb/>complicated human experience of what it feels like to be an emergency <lb/>room nurse. There are many possibilities for future Research through <lb/>Art studies to extend contemporary CSCW, but these methods must be <lb/>applied to appropriate research questions. <lb/>Finally, this study is limited to the imaginaries of participant <lb/>artists who are very early in their work-lives with limited experience <lb/>in specific careers, and we may have found different results with an <lb/>older or differently-experienced group of participants. We contend that <lb/>young adults should be included in discussions of possible futures, <lb/>which they have an undeniable stake in as people who will be spending <lb/>the most time in said future. However, our focus on young adults in this <lb/>particular study should not be taken to argue for the exclusion of other <lb/>generational cohorts, and we encourage future studies with additional <lb/>groups. The authors are also currently engaged in Research through Art <lb/>with established professional artists, which will be reported on in our <lb/>own future work. We contribute the voices of the young people in this <lb/>study as one part of the broader ongoing discussion about the future of <lb/>work in CSCW. <lb/>4 Results: qualities of human <lb/>experience in the future of work <lb/>There are few certainties in imagining and speculating <lb/>about futures, and the artists in our study explored their <lb/>hopes and their fears through artistic expression. In our <lb/>analysis, we found that the knowledge about human <lb/>experiences of work that the artists contributed was char-<lb/>acterized by contradictions and complexities, and we rec-<lb/>ognized that the defining theme of these qualities was their <lb/>embedded ambiguity. <lb/>We identified five primary dimensions of ambiguity <lb/>about imagined futures that productively capture consid-<lb/>erations of work: time, purpose, body, identity, and agency. <lb/>In this section, we introduce the insights developed about <lb/>each of these ambiguities as qualities to consider for the <lb/>future of work, indexed in Table 2. To illustrate these five <lb/>dimensions we assembled annotated portfolios detailing <lb/>art pieces created by our participants on the topic of the <lb/>future of work, along with text from their artist statements <lb/>and interviews (shown inside the boxes in the figures), and <lb/>research findings from the thematic analysis of these data. <lb/>In this way we are able to capture complex considerations <lb/>about the future by treating artistic expression as a legiti-<lb/>mate epistemic process of exploration, in combination with <lb/>more traditional qualitative approaches. <lb/>4.1 The ambiguity of time <lb/>Considerations of time in the future of work were a major <lb/>theme for the artists. In addition to expressing desires about <lb/>the quantity of time they wanted to spend working, they also <lb/>considered quality: thoughts about the value of their time <lb/>and what it is worth spending on. They explored the bound-<lb/>aries (or lack thereof) that we place around work time, <lb/>and the impacts of work across time scales from immediate <lb/>to long term to infinite. An annotated portfolio containing <lb/>some of the images and words related to time is in Figure 2. <lb/>Unsurprisingly, there was no consensus among the <lb/>artists about the ideal amount of time to spend on work. <lb/>Some described a desire to deprioritize work in favor of <lb/>more time for what they thought of as truly important. In his <lb/>four-part sculpture (pictured on the right side of Figure 2) <lb/>P3 depicts a worker living in alternate futures depending <lb/>on the amount of time they spend at work, ranging from <lb/>part time to 24/7. He described the worker as having more <lb/>time for a healthy social and family life while working part <lb/>time, and shows them progressively losing their humanity <lb/>and becoming a machine as they are more permanently <lb/>absorbed into the work. Voicing his own goals, he said, &quot;I&apos;m <lb/>going for the first one, I&apos;m going to work, get my education <lb/>and then work as little as possible.&quot; When asked to describe <lb/>his biggest fear about work in the future, he said: &quot;That it <lb/>would be constant and longer hours and mandatory.&quot; P5 <lb/>expressed similar concern about a life dominated by work: <lb/>&quot;Yeah, but also maybe that I have to give too much of my <lb/>time away for that [security]. So don&apos;t have time for any-<lb/>thing else that I want to do.&quot; These artists seemed to see <lb/></body>

All words outside of boxes <lb/>are researcher insights from thematic analysis. <lb/>work as something inevitable and necessary but encroach-<lb/>ing on freedom to be. The amount of time they might be <lb/>required to spend at work was one way this frustration <lb/>manifested for them. <lb/>Others were open to spending more time at work under <lb/>the right conditions, acknowledging that there can be dif-<lb/>ferent kinds of experiences in work. P2 said: &quot;I have heard <lb/>stories of people who&apos;s just working all the time and can not <lb/>let go of it. [. . . ] But still, it could also be nice if you have <lb/>the motivation to work all the time, because you liked it as <lb/>much.&quot; <lb/>Rather than a straight answer about how much work <lb/>time is ideal, flexibility was a common wish. P2 elaborated <lb/>on this further: &quot;I think it would be nice if it depends on <lb/>what you want to do. If you can feel you need the time to be <lb/>at home, and maybe focus on other things, then you didn&apos;t <lb/>have to work as much. And maybe in periods when you&apos;re <lb/>motivated for what you&apos;re doing at work, you could do a lot <lb/>more, [. . . ] instead of like, you have to go from nine to five.&quot; <lb/>Evoking a binary distinction between work and life <lb/>was a common way to highlight the artificiality of restric-<lb/>tions and pressures that workplaces can create, yet this <lb/></body>

        <body>distinction in itself was not necessarily always seen as a <lb/>negative. P3 described how having some time dedicated <lb/>to work meant he appreciated his time off of work, and <lb/>it helped him make the most of both. How he valued his <lb/>time was realized through contrast: &quot;I like working too. I <lb/>like doing something because there has to be some sort <lb/>of yin and yang. I tried not working. And then suddenly <lb/>that art or the creating became sort of my work or there <lb/>became no breaks, no bad things in it. So it stopped being so <lb/>interesting at a point. So I like to have something you have to <lb/>go to, and then something you can enjoy, so that free time is <lb/>created.&quot; <lb/>These notions of flexibility about how much time to <lb/>spend working are built on an assumption of a clear delin-<lb/>eation between work time and non-work time. Some of <lb/>the artists questioned this assumption entirely, raising the <lb/>possibility of an experience of time with blurry or even <lb/>nonexistent boundaries around it. The distinction between <lb/>working time and non-working time need not be binary <lb/>at all, according to P1: &quot;I feel like my work would be very <lb/>open and free. So I don&apos;t think there would be any time <lb/>out of work, because it would just be my life that was the <lb/>work.&quot; <lb/>In addition to considering the amount of time to be <lb/>spent working, the artists also identified the quality of that <lb/>time as a factor for exploration. Proces, seen in the bottom <lb/>left of Figure 2, depicts the artist&apos;s hands cutting fabric and <lb/>sewing it back together in an endless video loop. There is <lb/>an element of pointlessness and anxiety in this depiction: <lb/>it never rests, and we never see the finished result of this <lb/>labor. However, it also expresses a meditative softness and <lb/>calmness in the pacing, lighting, and sensuousness of the <lb/>materials. It balances on an edge between anxiety and self-<lb/>soothing. This piece led to a discussion about whether it <lb/>might not always be a bad thing to work without a con-<lb/>clusion, if the process itself is one that you find satisfying <lb/>or meaningful. The artist, P5, said: &quot;The clips loop, because <lb/>I feel the work system now is never ending. So I should <lb/>illustrate that. Or maybe also in the future, it should be <lb/>never ending. But the goal to be [. . . ] the process of it instead <lb/>of the money, like what you get out of it should be the time <lb/>that you spent.&quot; <lb/>Time was not only defined by its quality, quantity, and <lb/>boundaries of use. It was also explored with regard to <lb/>scale. The 4 Levels of Freedom shows the impact of work <lb/>time choices on an individual, as a more or less immedi-<lb/>ate consequence. The worker&apos;s decision (or presumed con-<lb/>sent) to sell their time to the employer manifests in visible <lb/>effects on their body and immediate environment, which <lb/>are felt in the moment, in that worker&apos;s own lifetime. Future <lb/>Homunculus, by P2, in the top left of Figure 2, is a depiction <lb/>of a hypothetical future human that has evolved over many <lb/>generations in adaptation to working habits and tools. This <lb/>future human has lost some parts we have today due to <lb/>disuse (such as little fingers and taller height) but its eyes <lb/>and brain have become much more powerful, an advan-<lb/>tageous adaptation over many generations of processing <lb/>intense sensory input. This sculpture shows an example of <lb/>a time scale longer than one lifetime, looking many genera-<lb/>tions into the future. The Proces video, with its neverending <lb/>sewing task which is impossible to finish, where experience <lb/>can be equal parts empty and generative, grapples with a <lb/>time scale that could be infinite. <lb/>On the surface, time may seem like an easily quantifi-<lb/>able thing, but we identify it as a dimension of ambiguity <lb/>due to the many grey areas the concept of time can contain. <lb/>For example, when considering time in discussions about <lb/>work, it is very easy to stay on the well-traveled roads <lb/>of the optimal number of work hours, or the value of a <lb/>person&apos;s time. However, the artists also highlighted other <lb/>aspects of time to think about in futures of work. We could <lb/>question whether the boundary around what is considered <lb/>working time is natural rather than a construct, where so-<lb/>called work-life balance is an ideal to strive for. We could <lb/>explore what it means to define the value of work time in <lb/>relation to other kinds of time, rather than quantitatively. <lb/>We might also consider the unexpected implications and <lb/>consequences of our practices over long-term, generational, <lb/>or even infinite time scales. <lb/>4.2 The ambiguity of purpose <lb/>Whereas time elicits familiar concerns of when and how <lb/>long, we must also consider purpose: why and what for. The <lb/>young artists in our study were still early in their work-<lb/>lives and their artistic careers, in a place where they could <lb/>imagine work-life but had not yet experienced many of its <lb/>realities. While they struggled with the idea of being con-<lb/>strained by workplace demands and reacted to what they <lb/>observed around them as forms of work encroaching on life <lb/>and freedom, they also saw the necessity and the generative <lb/>potential of work in their own futures. There is weight and <lb/>consequentiality to these imaginings anchored in the art <lb/>they created, which offered a multiplicity of futures up for <lb/>interpretation. The artists explored different kinds of pur-<lb/>pose in work, as well as whether purpose is located inside <lb/>or outside of the work, and who might benefit from these <lb/>conceptions of purpose. Images and text related to purpose <lb/>are shown in Figure 3. <lb/>There is a need for a purpose of some kind in work, but <lb/>how to define that purpose is open to many interpretations. <lb/></body>

All words outside of boxes are researcher <lb/>insights from thematic analysis. <lb/>Purpose in work could be a simple concept of capacity, as <lb/>articulated by P1: &quot;I&apos;d just do what I was most capable of <lb/>doing.&quot; P5 expressed frustration in her Proces video (on the <lb/>left of Figure 3) about the futility -the purposelessness -she <lb/>sees in the current state of work. Rather than proposing a <lb/>well-defined purpose in response to this void, she proposed <lb/>enjoyment of the process of work itself as a purpose: &quot;What <lb/>should be the goal for working? Because now I feel like there <lb/>isn&apos;t a goal and we&apos;re all working for something that&apos;s never <lb/>ending, or we don&apos;t get to the point where we are satisfied. <lb/>So I see that work in the future [. . . ] the goal will be that it <lb/>should be enjoyable. And it should be something that you <lb/>like.&quot; <lb/>Rather than finding meaning in the work itself, the <lb/>purpose of a given form of work could also be outside of the <lb/>work altogether, as simple as a means to an end: working in <lb/>order to enable, finance, or otherwise facilitate activities in <lb/>a non-work part of life, as described by P4: &quot;I&apos;m doing it only <lb/>so I get the skills to do my own projects on the side. That&apos;s <lb/>why I want to do it. And because I&apos;m skilled in that sense, and <lb/>I will learn more about this thing that I find very interesting <lb/>by also working in it, I can earn money from a thing that I&apos;m <lb/>good at, and I love.&quot; <lb/>Doing what you love, or loving what you do, seems like <lb/>a good prospect for having purpose in work. However, the <lb/>artists also considered the pitfalls of making your passion <lb/>your career. The possibility that the thing you love doing <lb/>might be drained of joy once you become dependent on it <lb/>to make money, is a hazard further described by P4: &quot;When <lb/>I talk to my friends, we&apos;re all very depressed that we have <lb/>to work the rest of our lives. So the thing is that we&apos;re all <lb/>working towards getting to work with something that we <lb/>like, but we all know that you&apos;ll get tired of that at some <lb/>point, and you will also be exploited and it&apos;s wherever you <lb/>go [. . . ] it&apos;s gonna suck pretty much, so I have a really hard <lb/>time about it.&quot; <lb/>There is a tinge of resignation to many of these imag-<lb/>inings, where personal passions might be cannibalised by <lb/>the inevitability of having to become part of the consumer <lb/>society. Some artists, however, insisted on holding on to their <lb/></body>

        <body>passions and making them work. Whether or not it was <lb/>desirable for a personal purpose and a work purpose to <lb/>blur together varied among the artists. When speculating <lb/>about a future working as an artist with a lot of freedom, <lb/>P1 elaborated further: &quot;If I want to do any work, I&apos;ll do it. <lb/>And if I don&apos;t want to, I will still think about it, because it&apos;s <lb/>my hobby. So, I don&apos;t really see it as my work, just see it as <lb/>a thing I do.&quot; Alternatively, P3 saw work as an impediment <lb/>to the important things in life, not something that should <lb/>become a life&apos;s defining purpose: &quot;I don&apos;t think your work <lb/>should define you. It&apos;s cool if you like your work, but that&apos;s <lb/>sort of a fear in me that some people rather want to focus <lb/>on their work than their relationships with other people or <lb/>their family.&quot; <lb/>Personal enjoyment, facilitating other parts of one&apos;s <lb/>life, or the question of blending together one&apos;s work purpose <lb/>and life purpose, are all intrinsic conceptions of purpose: <lb/>purpose that is oriented inward, that feeds the workers <lb/>themselves. The artists also imagined finding extrinsic pur-<lb/>pose in work by looking outward, in doing something that <lb/>matters to others. Knowing that whatever labor you are <lb/>performing has a positive effect as part of a bigger whole is a <lb/>point that came up several times. P4 expressed: &quot;I would like <lb/>that we all had this idea and knew that we&apos;re actually con-<lb/>tributing to something good as a society because I feel like <lb/>a lot of people are willing to work if we know we&apos;re going <lb/>to [. . . ] help each other. [. . . ] But now, it&apos;s being exploited a <lb/>lot. So, that whole idea has just gotten lost because we hate <lb/>the people who hire us, when we don&apos;t feel like we&apos;re giving <lb/>anything.&quot; <lb/>The purpose of work is a complex topic with many <lb/>dimensions to consider. It is clear that without a purpose, <lb/>there is little motivation to engage with work. However, find-<lb/>ing or creating a purpose in work could take many shapes <lb/>beyond simple notions of accomplishment, productivity, or <lb/>completion of a task. Is the worker&apos;s purpose located inside <lb/>or outside of the work context? Is this purpose intrinsic (for <lb/>their own benefit) or extrinsic (for the benefit of others), <lb/>individualized or part of a bigger whole? What are the <lb/>advantages and disadvantages when work purpose and life <lb/>purpose overlap? How does the sense of purpose affect the <lb/>well-being of a worker? <lb/>4.3 The ambiguity of the body <lb/>Well-being is not only a mental concept, but also a physical <lb/>one. Some jobs depend on the worker&apos;s physical presence <lb/>in the workspace, but even when people have the ability to <lb/>appear virtually or remotely at work, our physical bodies <lb/>remain part of the arrangement and need to be considered. <lb/>The artists explored aspects of what it is to have a body in <lb/>possible futures of work. Images and text about the body are <lb/>shown in Figure 4. What do our bodies look like? What do <lb/>they feel like? How do they function and not function? What <lb/>are the borders of our bodies when we integrate technology <lb/>into our work lives? <lb/>Figure 4: An annotated portfolio exploring the ambiguity of the body.

        <body>The Future Homunculus sculpture (on the right side of <lb/>Figure 4), a vision of a future human who has evolved in <lb/>response to the technology we all might constantly use, deals <lb/>directly with this concept. It looks in some ways disturbingly <lb/>weak and alien, and in other ways capable and cute. The <lb/>atrophy of muscle tone and stature, as well as the loss of <lb/>toes and some fingers due to disuse, is unsettling. However, <lb/>the eyes, ears, and brain look much more powerful and <lb/>exciting than what humans have today, almost suggesting <lb/>a superpower level of sensory and mental ability. Is it desir-<lb/>able to become this homunculus? The artist, P2, specifically <lb/>embraced the ambiguity of that possibility: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s <lb/>a negative thing. It&apos;s just my thoughts about how we use <lb/>our body now. How are we going to do in the future? So <lb/>I&apos;ve tried to make this as neutral as possible.&quot; In contrast <lb/>to the prospect of a natural evolution with technology, P3&apos;s <lb/>The 4 Levels of Freedom shows scenarios of a worker&apos;s body <lb/>being invaded by technology that is foreign to it, perhaps a <lb/>dystopian progression of today&apos;s fledgling experiments with <lb/>biohacking. (Part three of the sculpture is shown in the bot-<lb/>tom center of Figure 4). In the most extreme versions of this <lb/>colonization, the worker&apos;s body has been almost completely <lb/>absorbed by the technology and isn&apos;t recognizable as human <lb/>anymore: &quot;And then, I just took it to the next level [. . . ] where <lb/>people start to you know, have the code to their doors in <lb/>their skin so they could beep in their hand, or going out. So <lb/>that would become even more part of your work. [. . . ] This <lb/>one is even more submerged, to the point where you kind of <lb/>just sort of sold yourself and you don&apos;t know what you are <lb/>anymore, you&apos;re just a part of your work.&quot; <lb/>With regard to bodies, physical health and ability <lb/>informed a lot of ideas, fears, and discussions about the <lb/>future of work as well. The artists spoke about disability, <lb/>mental health, and burnout in relation to the larger prob-<lb/>lems of exploitation or lack of humanity in a work culture. <lb/>Concurrent with a desire for people to be treated equally, <lb/>was an anxiety that standardized work expectations will be <lb/>applied to all people regardless of their individual bodies. <lb/>P2 expressed: &quot;I think that some people can work. And that&apos;s <lb/>just how it is. We have to respect that we are different also <lb/>in the way we are built. And maybe that the fear could <lb/>also be that all people have to work as much as the other <lb/>person.&quot; P4 also concurred, comparing an ideal future to the <lb/>problematic present: &quot;You don&apos;t get burned out and [. . . ] you <lb/>get to take those breaks that we need as human. Right now <lb/>we&apos;re using our bodies in a way that was never meant for <lb/>bodies. That&apos;s why we&apos;re all really stressing out. And that&apos;s <lb/>why it&apos;s so normalized the way that we&apos;re all getting really <lb/>sick mentally. Which is always neglected.&quot; <lb/>When considering future work sites, systems, and tech-<lb/>nologies, there are many aspects to consider for the physical <lb/>bodies of workers beyond the traditional human factors <lb/>issues considered by industries today. The ergonomics of <lb/>a particular device or workspace are certainly important, <lb/>but we could also take an open-minded look beyond these <lb/>traditional concerns for bodies in the workplace, and con-<lb/>sider the long term or generational physical effects of a work <lb/>practice, the rest requirements of a person, the spectrum <lb/>of disability (inclusive of both physical and mental health), <lb/>and where the boundaries of a worker&apos;s body truly are <lb/>in any given scenario. The boundaries of bodies are also <lb/>connected with our ideas of self and identity, as physical <lb/>manifestations are as important as internal balance. <lb/>4.4 The ambiguity of identity <lb/>One manifestation of having a body at work is the way a <lb/>worker uses that body to express identity. In the artists&apos; <lb/>conceptions of identity at work, a tension emerged: how <lb/>much of yourself can you bring to work, and how much of <lb/>work might you bring into yourself? <lb/>To be human is to have many facets to our identities <lb/>which exist simultaneously. 70 These facets are only partially <lb/>displayed in different situations, depending on what aspects <lb/>of our humanity are considered acceptable to reveal in <lb/>given contexts. P4 commented on the unspoken rules of <lb/>presenting yourself at work: &quot;There&apos;s quite a lot of judg-<lb/>ment for people who go outside of the norm of the way <lb/>you can look, or you can look in a workspace.&quot; However, <lb/>how you are allowed to present yourself while working <lb/>goes beyond issues of physical appearance. The decisions a <lb/>worker may make about their self-presentation can be an <lb/>expression of who they know themselves to be and what <lb/>they want to show, beyond the image narrowly defined <lb/>by their workplace. As workplaces get more digital, possi-<lb/>bilities for alternative forms of self-presentation and self-<lb/>expression increase as well. Images and text related to iden-<lb/>tity are presented in Figure 5. <lb/>P4&apos;s Furry Supremacy is a series of four images (on <lb/>the left in Figure 4) proposed as future workplace digital <lb/>avatars. The artist grappled with the concept of identity <lb/>and expressed some pessimistic views about the present <lb/>and the future in the interviews. However, there is also a <lb/>hopefulness in the vision of the avatars as fantastical non-<lb/>human expressions, the idea that we could be unlimited <lb/>and able to have control over how we are perceived by <lb/>others and how we express ourselves, and the desire to have <lb/>complete freedom to construct an identity for the self in the <lb/>future. P4 imagined how this opportunity could be part of <lb/>an online workplace via the use of creative avatars: &quot;If we <lb/></body>

        <body>Figure 5: An annotated portfolio exploring the ambiguity of identity. Clockwise from top left: quote by P5, Future Homunculus sculpture by P2, The 4 <lb/>Levels of Freedom (part 4) sculpture by P3, excerpt of artist statement by P3, Furry Supremacy digital art prints by P4. Center: quote by P4. All words <lb/>outside of boxes are researcher insights from thematic analysis. <lb/>work in digital spaces, [. . . ] we have a whole new thing of <lb/>actually visualizing ourselves, which I think is a positive <lb/>thing. Yeah, so my idea is [. . . ] expressing yourself kind of <lb/>digitally now. And who you are, not based on what you were <lb/>given at birth that how you look, but how when we work <lb/>in computers, we get to decide ourselves how we present <lb/>ourselves.&quot; This is also a critique of the lack of imagination <lb/>in present-day digital self-presentation, which P4 sees as <lb/>unnecessarily limited by our preconceived norms from the <lb/>physical world: &quot;I thought that was kind of funny how these <lb/>norms we have for how we look also go into the online world <lb/>[. . . ] which I find baffling because you have all this whole <lb/>world of opportunities of how you want to present yourself.&quot; <lb/>The artist held hopefulness about the freedom of expression <lb/>in this potential future, simultaneously with doubtfulness <lb/>that it would actually become a reality: &quot;I actually, to be <lb/>honest, don&apos;t really see this as a thing. [. . . ] I&apos;d like to see <lb/>a place where people who kind of feel that way, that need <lb/>to visualize themselves to show people who they are, get <lb/>the opportunity to do that. [. . . ] You know, but I don&apos;t see <lb/>it happening.&quot; This hopefulness about the potential of self-<lb/>expression within the workplace as something that offers <lb/>myriad creative possibilities is tinged with resignation that <lb/>workplace norms of self-presentation will not be so easily <lb/>overcome. Can workplaces be safe for open self-expression <lb/>and still take workers seriously for the work they do? After <lb/>all, why can&apos;t your lawyer be a cat online and still represent <lb/>you in court? 71 <lb/>Expanding the identity beyond the traditional confines <lb/>of what we consider to be human was a complex topic raised <lb/>by several of the artists, who had very different takes on <lb/>the idea. As expressed in Furry Supremacy, P4 finds the idea <lb/>of becoming a nonhuman freeing: &quot;I don&apos;t really vibe with <lb/>the human look [. . . ] I also do makeup, and even when I <lb/>do that, I never want to do anything human. But I think <lb/>that&apos;s how I see myself that always goes into my work. That&apos;s <lb/>just kind of non human, because I kind of resent it. So I <lb/>tried to create something else.&quot; As mentioned above, P2 <lb/>described Future Homunculus as intentionally emotionally <lb/>neutral on the idea of this evolution into a creature that <lb/>appears nonhuman, or more-than-human, in many ways. <lb/>And at the other end of the spectrum, P3&apos;s The 4 Levels <lb/>of Freedom presents the prospect of becoming nonhuman <lb/>not as an opportunity, but as a horrific loss of the human <lb/>identity. He described part four of the piece (on right of <lb/>Figure 5) as follows: &quot;And then you come to the last stage, <lb/>which is Sold, where it has lost his body and is hanging <lb/>up. And it&apos;s just a big face connected with the whole thing, <lb/>now it&apos;s even more submerged into the computer and work <lb/>environment. So now you&apos;re just a number, and not even a <lb/>person anymore. So this one doesn&apos;t nearly have feelings <lb/>or know anything better.&quot; Describing an acceptable work <lb/></body>

        <body>role and identity, P5 stated it succinctly: &quot;You are not the <lb/>machine.&quot; <lb/>Who we are at work is a multifaceted question. How <lb/>much of our identities are we able and willing to share at <lb/>work? How does working change our identities and affect <lb/>our humanity? What are the potential advantages, losses, <lb/>and freedoms associated with this question? What aspects <lb/>of ourselves must we give up to fit into our work envi-<lb/>ronments, whether online or on site? How much of our <lb/>workplace ideals and norms do we internalize in the end, as <lb/>these convictions shape our selves and actions throughout <lb/>our lives? <lb/>4.5 The ambiguity of agency <lb/>Agency isn&apos;t only a capacity to act, it is also about the poten-<lb/>tial impact of your actions. How effective can you be? What <lb/>can you effect? This is internal and also external. What <lb/>power is constraining what is possible? Images and text <lb/>pertaining to the ambiguity of agency are shown in Figure 6. <lb/>The artists found many ways to explore agency through <lb/>the concepts of freedom, personal power, and the lack <lb/>thereof at work. The 4 Levels of Freedom expresses this <lb/>multiplicity of visions as four parts which relate and con-<lb/>trast with each other. These &quot;levels&quot; exist on a spectrum <lb/>of &apos;hopeful&apos; to &apos;absolute nightmare.&apos; Each piece is a person, <lb/>possibly the same person, expressed in alternate realities of <lb/>the future ranging from a person completely unencumbered <lb/>by work, to a person who has become so invaded by work <lb/>technology that they no longer exist separate from their <lb/>job. These pieces depict a spectrum of choice: the subject <lb/>in the earlier pieces has the power to opt out of the &quot;rat <lb/>race&quot; altogether, and in each subsequent piece that subject <lb/>has chosen to engage at progressively deeper levels with the <lb/>artist&apos;s conception of a capitalist work system. It is up for <lb/>debate whether this person may have lost their ability to <lb/>give ongoing consent to the circumstances in the final stages. <lb/>The middle two pieces are particularly interesting <lb/>because they aren&apos;t all-good or all-bad, and leave a lot of <lb/>interpretation up to the viewers. These ambiguous pieces <lb/>Figure 6: An annotated portfolio exploring the ambiguity of agency.

        <body>can elicit a variety of reactions: for example, one of the <lb/>authors was excited by part two (the person surrounded by <lb/>devices, seen top center of Figure 6) as an accurate depiction <lb/>of a functional ecology of devices in a work environment, <lb/>whereas the artist himself described it as an uncomfortable <lb/>lack of privacy and personal space, as the person has opted <lb/>into a state of surveillance, choosing to &quot;rent&quot; out their <lb/>time, privacy, and body in exchange for resources: &quot;You&apos;re <lb/>sacrificing your time and your privacy. We see the cameras <lb/>all over, and then he has his phone, in his own hand, your <lb/>whole life in your phone. And there&apos;s stamps on the back, <lb/>like you are a letter or part of something bigger. So you are <lb/>renting your time to buy the things you want, at the cost of <lb/>your time and privacy.&quot; <lb/>The ideas of surveillance and control as they relate <lb/>to future work arrangements were explored as a personal <lb/>problem (as in The 4 Levels of Freedom) and also as a soci-<lb/>etal problem. Fremtidens Dominans, a sculpture by P1 (seen <lb/>on the right side of Figure 6) depicts a future cityscape <lb/>dominated by an enormous surveillance tower which is <lb/>connected to every building. It is a version of the panop-<lb/>ticon, all-seeing and all-knowing. It leaves the viewer to <lb/>wonder whether this is an image of the future at all, or <lb/>simply an interpretation of the present: a lot of its elements <lb/>(for example, being connected everywhere all the time, and <lb/>negative environmental impact) are features of our current <lb/>world, particularly in big cities. P1 makes the connection: <lb/>&quot;It&apos;s about the future&apos;s dominance, where the government <lb/>is connected to every single one of the people living in the <lb/>city, like in a metropol, where it&apos;s all connected. So even <lb/>though you walk around on the street, you will always be <lb/>connected to something. And in this example, it&apos;s connected <lb/>to the government. [. . . ] I mean, this example is far into the <lb/>future, because it&apos;s a whole city that is connected. But now <lb/>I also see it because of our phones, or in China where they <lb/>have cameras everywhere.&quot; In the statement card accom-<lb/>panying the sculpture (bottom center of Figure 6), the artist <lb/>describes this landscape of power and the lack of agency of <lb/>the individuals in such a system, emphasizing the ruthless <lb/>&quot;dominance&quot; of a corrupt system over the people subject <lb/>to it. These works engage with some very large questions. <lb/>Where do people have choices, and where are those choices <lb/>made for them? Do people genuinely have agency when they <lb/>exist inside different kinds of systems, some openly coercive <lb/>and exploitative systems, and others busy gently nudging <lb/>and motivating in the supposed right direction? <lb/>In opposition to the experience of being under the <lb/>thumb of an entity which has power over you, the artists <lb/>described ways that their own personal power -or agency <lb/>-was relevant in a workplace. P5 related the frustrating <lb/>experience of being expected to wield agency she did not <lb/>actually possess in a job: &quot;People [. . . ] just see something, <lb/>someone that works. And they often think that we know <lb/>everything and can do everything. So if there is a problem, <lb/>we should just solve it. And sometimes we don&apos;t have the <lb/>power to do it. We can just call our boss and be like, we have <lb/>this problem, do something.&quot; Sometimes, having agency in <lb/>work means having dignity, and being trusted by others. <lb/>One participant talked about how workers need to have the <lb/>power to decide how much they are able to give to a job, <lb/>and described the respect of that agency as trust: &quot;Yeah, <lb/>exactly. And like trusting that each person, trusting. Right <lb/>now I&apos;m on [unemployment assistance], and that&apos;s horrible <lb/>because they don&apos;t trust us to want to give back to society. <lb/>So, we need to get a feeling of actually wanting to have a <lb/>working community and that we&apos;re working towards some-<lb/>thing together. Except that right now we&apos;re being exploited.&quot; <lb/>Personal agency could also take the form of being your own <lb/>boss, and having the ability to keep the benefit of your own <lb/>labor, as expressed by P1: &quot;I don&apos;t want to sit in an office <lb/>from 8 to 5 everyday just doing something for somebody <lb/>else. I don&apos;t. I want to do it for myself.&quot; This is having the <lb/>power to pursue an intrinsic purpose, as described earlier <lb/>in this section. Taken one step further, agency could extend <lb/>not just to yourself, but also to collaborations. P4 described <lb/>a goal of having the agency to take a leadership role in <lb/>future projects: &quot;Working with other artists, I think working <lb/>with creative people, making some ideas I have come to life <lb/>and, and maybe sometime far in the future, having some <lb/>authority to do a creative project with others.&quot; <lb/>It&apos;s easy to equate the idea of a worker&apos;s personal <lb/>agency with the simple idea of being your own boss. How-<lb/>ever, the artists highlighted that expressions of agency can <lb/>exist in other hierarchies and work structures, when people <lb/>are properly empowered to achieve their tasks, trusted to <lb/>make decisions, and able to see paths to advancement. On <lb/>the other hand, expressions of a lack of agency ask: where <lb/>are the limits of our power to choose, when we work in <lb/>oppressive or exploitative contexts? <lb/>5 Discussion <lb/>Traditional CSCW research has focused on identifying, <lb/>defining, and describing practices, artifacts, processes, and <lb/>technologies. There is no tradition in CSCW research for <lb/>exploring what is undefinable, ambiguous, or yet to come. <lb/>We want to push CSCW research to not only study and <lb/>design for what is, but also to consider what will be -or <lb/>rather what could be.

        <body>it as a problem to be solved. We frequently try to spec-<lb/>ify, explain, and ultimately resolve ambiguities -to make <lb/>them go away. However, as Gaver et al. and others have <lb/>argued, ambiguities can be useful, and there are advantages <lb/>to engaging with them in the field of CSCW. Our findings sug-<lb/>gest that ambiguities are not only useful, they are inevitable <lb/>and necessary. Ambiguities are a key part of exploring a <lb/>complex problem space, and to eliminate ambiguities pre-<lb/>maturely is to limit possibilities for innovation and design. <lb/>We suggest to embrace ambiguities, stay with the trouble, <lb/>and acknowledge that grappling with ambiguities can be a <lb/>powerful practice for shaping possibilities for the future of <lb/>work. <lb/>5.1 Enriching inquiry by attending to <lb/>ambiguities <lb/>What qualities are important to consider about the human <lb/>experience in the future of work when we design future <lb/>CSCW technologies? Based upon our analyses of the artist <lb/>statements, art pieces, and interview data, we identified <lb/>five dimensions of ambiguity (time, purpose, body, identity, <lb/>and agency) relevant to exploring the future of work. We <lb/>depict these ambiguities and their connections in Figure 7, <lb/>calling back to Donna Haraway&apos;s tangled ball of yarn from <lb/>which she can metaphorically pull out different connected <lb/>threads of meaning. 18 Each dimension of ambiguity listed <lb/>in our findings is labeled as a node in the yarn tangle. <lb/>Each node represents a multifinality: a starting point which <lb/>can lead to many different outcomes, conceptualized by its <lb/>connection to the other nodes via the strings. In the fashion <lb/>of Haraway, following any one of the strings would prompt a <lb/>story: in this case, a question waiting to be asked, traversing <lb/>between nodes. This exploration of multifinalities acknowl-<lb/>edges that precision is illusory. It offers these ambiguities <lb/>Figure 7: Multifinalities of ambiguities, depicted as tangled pieces of <lb/>string. <lb/>as touchpoints to begin from, return to, and entangle with <lb/>each other -and possibilities for where these ambiguities <lb/>might be useful. As our goal in this process is to expand the <lb/>problem space for the future of work and enrich the inquiry <lb/>therein, the outcomes of these multifinalities are questions <lb/>that researchers and designers can ask. <lb/>A researcher investigating the future of work might <lb/>logically begin by asking questions about one ambiguity, <lb/>and then move into a deeper, more nuanced exploration of <lb/>the problem space by looking at the possible entanglements <lb/>of these dimensions. Inquiries can start at any node in the <lb/>diagram, and then join with the other nodes to form sub-<lb/>inquiries, extending into new territories of ideas, questions, <lb/>and concerns. The choice of the starting point will structure <lb/>the resulting questions, making clear that where we begin <lb/>always affects where we will end up. After all, our multiple <lb/>possible futures remain defined by our present. <lb/>To illustrate how an exploration of these multifinalities <lb/>about the future of work could take place, we present below <lb/>a hypothetical line of questioning. To ground our example <lb/>in a current work context and demonstrate how it can <lb/>augment existing research practices in CSCW while orient-<lb/>ing toward human experience in the future, we will base <lb/>this line of questioning on Anastasia Sergeeva&apos;s insightful <lb/>postphenomenological case study 21 of Dutch physiothera-<lb/>pists practicing remote care during the Covid-19 pandemic <lb/>lockdown. <lb/>Beginning our inquiry, we choose to consider the ambi-<lb/>guity of the body in the future of work, as it is a natural <lb/>starting place for a case about physiotherapy. As detailed in <lb/>the previous section, our findings revealed body ambiguities <lb/>pertaining to disability or altered functionality of bodies, <lb/>and the boundaries of our bodies with regard to technology, <lb/>as well as issues such as rest and mental health. In this <lb/>example, we choose to focus on the idea of affected ability. <lb/>Inspired by the sensory evolutions depicted by P2 in the <lb/>Future Homunculus sculpture, we choose to start by asking <lb/>one specific question about the body related to the work <lb/>experience of the physiotherapists described in Sergeeva&apos;s <lb/>study: <lb/>(body) How might physiotherapists cope with the loss of <lb/>their sense of touch when working remotely? <lb/>Exploring this question might lead us to unpack the human <lb/>experience of the physiotherapist who must treat patients <lb/>via videoconferencing. <lb/>We could then move a step beyond the singular focus <lb/>on body, and look at this specific sensory deficit question <lb/>entangled with each of the other ambiguities in the possible <lb/>futures of work. Our question about coping with the lack <lb/></body>

        <body>of haptic ability is, in itself, a multifinality, with the poten-<lb/>tial to spawn new sub-questions in multiple directions. By <lb/>prompting in this way, we expand the depth of our inquiry. <lb/>Here is one round of inquiry which begins with our first <lb/>question, and teases out the strings connecting it to the other <lb/>ambiguities in the illustration, asking a new sub-question <lb/>for each string: <lb/>(body) How might physiotherapists cope with the loss of <lb/>their sense of touch when working remotely? <lb/>1. (body + time) Will patients take longer to progress <lb/>when physiotherapists cannot use their sense of <lb/>touch to help them? <lb/>2. (body + purpose) If the &quot;hands-on&quot; (touch) aspect <lb/>of physiotherapy is lost, do physiotherapists still <lb/>want to do this job? <lb/>3. (body + identity) Does a change in how you <lb/>accomplish your job tasks (without the sense <lb/>of touch) impact the professional identity of <lb/>physiotherapists? <lb/>4. (body + agency) Does the loss of precision when <lb/>verbalizing instead of using the sense of touch feel <lb/>like a loss of control for physiotherapists? <lb/>Any of these resultant questions could then be explored <lb/>further, by repeating the above process reflexively in sub-<lb/>sequent rounds of inquiry. For example, we could treat <lb/>our final body + agency question as a new multifinality, <lb/>beginning with it again and entangling it with the remaining <lb/>ambiguities once more: <lb/>(body + agency) Does the loss of precision when verbal-<lb/>izing instead of using the sense of touch feel like a loss <lb/>of control for physiotherapists? <lb/>(body + agency + time) How long would it take a <lb/>physiotherapist to feel confidently precise at ver-<lb/>balizing instructions rather than demonstrating <lb/>them through touch? <lb/>(body + agency + purpose) Does a lack of control <lb/>due to the loss of touch hinder a physiotherapist&apos;s <lb/>goal of helping patients? <lb/>(body + agency + identity) Could a <lb/>physiotherapist&apos;s reduced control due to <lb/>compensating for loss of touch impact how <lb/>patients respect or relate to them? <lb/>In this way, we can expand questions and ideas at any <lb/>node by subjecting them to the other nodes, and ultimately <lb/>use the dimensions of ambiguity as a prism to reveal new <lb/>connections, relationships, and entanglements related to <lb/>the future of work in a given domain. As a designer of <lb/>future work technology, these questions have the potential <lb/>to inform what or how you choose to design, or who you are <lb/>designing for. As a researcher, these questions can inspire <lb/>new research questions, or deep dives into aspects of your <lb/>existing dataset or case, revealing more areas for future <lb/>exploration. <lb/>We contribute the demonstration of one way to struc-<lb/>ture such an exploration. As CSCW researchers, we applied <lb/>this to the problem space of the human experience in the <lb/>future of work, and offer these multifinalities for the use of <lb/>anyone engaged in futuring for CSCW. However, the process <lb/>of Research through Art and qualitative analysis we used <lb/>to identify these dimensions of ambiguity for the future <lb/>of work could also be replicated for other domains, for <lb/>example the future of education, the future of fashion, or <lb/>the future of architecture, resulting in the identification of <lb/>(possibly) different sets of multifinalities and entanglements <lb/>to explore in those respective domains. Further, while it is <lb/>beyond the scope of this paper, the explorations of ambi-<lb/>guities could also take the form of exploratory prototyping, <lb/>utilizing prototypes as forms of inquiry unpacking the phe-<lb/>nomenon rather than solving a concrete problem. <lb/>5.2 Extending CSCW with multifinalities <lb/>We extend the ways in which contemporary CSCW can <lb/>engage with the study of work, by expanding the focus of <lb/>the field from studying what work is to include the study of <lb/>the experience of work and what work can become. Studying <lb/>work is fundamental for CSCW research, 1 as the core analyt-<lb/>ical focus of the field is to design technologies which enable <lb/>rather than constrain actors in their endeavors. 72 The tra-<lb/>dition of ethnography in CSCW, in particular, provides rich <lb/>insights into work practices in the present day context. On <lb/>the other hand, through artistic futuring CSCW research can <lb/>produce a different set of insights into work. We identified <lb/>ambiguities as particular areas of concern that are present <lb/>now and that structure the artist&apos;s imaginaries of the future. <lb/>These ambiguities are relevant to current and future tech <lb/>development efforts because they point to fundamentally <lb/>important considerations of what work is or could be. In the <lb/>wake of the global pandemic and the attendant seismic shift <lb/>in work practices, this is a particularly opportune time for <lb/>those engaged in the study of work to reflect not just about <lb/>what work is, but also what we want work to be. <lb/>The five ambiguities we present in this paper are not <lb/>novel concepts on their own, because as qualities of human <lb/>experience they encapsulate fundamental parts of being a <lb/>person who works -parts which have often been under-<lb/>valued in research. Prior CSCW research has studied and <lb/>designed for time, and to some extent considered purpose, <lb/></body>

        <body>agency and body as important features to explore in work, <lb/>for the design of technologies and artifacts. 28 However, <lb/>rather than seeing these as ambiguities, the conceptual <lb/>understandings in prior CSCW research have been driven <lb/>by an attempt to comprehend these qualities as elements <lb/>or concrete features for design. In contrast, we extend the <lb/>conceptual understanding of fundamental concepts such <lb/>as time, agency, and body by redirecting our attention to <lb/>these qualities as ambiguous multifinalities rather than as <lb/>features for design, arguing for the benefit of keeping these <lb/>ambiguities as deliberately open-ended starting points for <lb/>possible futures. Exploring what we want work to be in <lb/>the future through multifinalities influences our design <lb/>endeavors by foregrounding fundamental concerns about <lb/>human experience (such as the dimensions of ambiguity <lb/>we identified), making them worthy of attention equal to <lb/>traditional concerns about work such as reducing the efforts <lb/>of articulation work across distance. It is not a method of <lb/>problem solving, but rather a technique for interrogating <lb/>which problems we might choose to solve in the first place, <lb/>and why. <lb/>6 Conclusions <lb/>Seeking to extend the scope of contemporary CSCW <lb/>research, in this study we adopt a broadened agenda for <lb/>CSCW: growing from a focus on the mechanics of work <lb/>to a focus inclusive of human experience, engaging with <lb/>futuring practices that expand from the rich foundation <lb/>of grounded knowledge in the present state of CSCW, <lb/>and calling for a recognition of the value of ambiguity <lb/>in research and design about work. We also contribute <lb/>Research through Art as form of epistemic inquiry to the <lb/>CSCW research toolkit. <lb/>We asked: What qualities are important to consider <lb/>about the human experience in the future of work? Through <lb/>artistic research engaging with young artists early in their <lb/>careers, we explored the &quot;human experience&quot; of work: what <lb/>it feels like to work, how work affects you and changes <lb/>you, what a work-life means. This research question is not <lb/>about how to successfully accomplish work tasks, how to <lb/>structure work, or how to define work, which are more <lb/>traditional CSCW questions. Instead we question what it&apos;s <lb/>like to be a person who is working, and how we might con-<lb/>sciously incorporate that experiential knowledge into our <lb/>ideas, designs, and conceptions of work for the future. We <lb/>discovered that the &quot;qualities to consider&quot; in our research <lb/>question are not a straightforward set of recommendations <lb/>to &quot;do this, not that&quot; with an implied value judgment, nor <lb/>are they a checklist of requirements to meet. Instead, we <lb/>identified five interconnected dimensions of ambiguity <lb/>which, when explored, can produce thoughtful open-ended <lb/>considerations about the potential experience and impact <lb/>of future work technologies, systems, and scenarios. We <lb/>conceive of these ambiguities as multifinalities (able to open <lb/>up many different possible futures from the same starting <lb/>point), and demonstrate an approach for expanding these <lb/>ambiguities that CSCW researchers and designers can use <lb/>for exploration about the future of work. <lb/></body>
