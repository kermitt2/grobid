        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>A business model comprises several components, in-<lb/>cluding the value proposition and the organizational <lb/>and technological architecture that enables the val-<lb/>ue creation and appropriation among diverse stake-<lb/>holders through a specific configuration of activities. <lb/>A company&apos;s business model encapsulates all en-<lb/>deavors to address the challenges of value creation, <lb/>configuration, and appropriation (Foss &amp; Saebi, 2017, <lb/>p. 61; Osterwalder &amp; Pigneur, 2010; Wirtz et al., 2016). <lb/>Nevertheless, it is impossible to generate value without <lb/>the company having secured a viable business mod-<lb/>el. Moreover, firms frequently lack insights into how to <lb/>configure or appropriate value (Teece, 2010). <lb/>Companies consistently engage in experimenta-<lb/>tion to discover a suitable business model, particularly <lb/>evident in open business models like alliances (Hagiu <lb/>&amp; Wright, 2015; Kortmann &amp; Piller, 2016) or service eco-<lb/>systems (Frow et al., 2014). <lb/>A business ecosystem is a space of interdepen-<lb/>dencies between a multilateral set of actors from var-<lb/>ious industries (suppliers, customers, competitors, and <lb/>complementors). Firms that operate in a business eco-<lb/>system by a platform business model have come to <lb/>dominate the world today, in terms of both scale and <lb/>performance (market capitalization). Some popular ex-<lb/>amples include Airbnb, Uber, Facebook, Amazon, and <lb/>Google (Srinivasan, 2021). For that reason, incumbent <lb/>firms must make alliances with these platforms to cre-<lb/>ate value collaboratively, while also striving to main-<lb/>tain competitiveness. Nevertheless, given their nature <lb/>as value networks (Stabell &amp; Fjeldstad, 1998), multisid-<lb/>ed platforms entail coordination challenges (Evans &amp; <lb/>Schmalensee, 2013). <lb/>With such scenario in mind, some questions are <lb/>prone to appear, e.g., how to implement a coopeti-<lb/>tive strategy on a multisided platform business model? <lb/>How does a platform harmonize the actions of vari-<lb/>ous participants through technologies, products, and <lb/>services? <lb/>Numerous scientific studies delve into the success <lb/>of major multilateral platforms, which predominantly <lb/>belong to the technology sector. Nonetheless, the sci-<lb/>entific literature presents a notable scarcity of concrete <lb/>examples of multilateral platforms operating in tradi-<lb/>tional markets outside the realm of technology firms, <lb/>particularly in sectors like pharmaceutical retail, as pre-<lb/>sented here in this paper. <lb/>Can a non-technological multilateral platform serve <lb/>as a viable solution for value creation among diverse <lb/>actors within a coopetitive environment, in traditional <lb/>industries, such as retail? <lb/>To answer this question, this study specifically in-<lb/>vestigates the distinct challenges faced by FEBRAFAR <lb/>(Brazilian Federation of Independent Drugstore <lb/>Chains), a non-technological, non-profit organization, <lb/>in the development and maintenance of an effective <lb/>and valuable multisided business model. <lb/>Established in February 2000, FEBRAFAR is a multi-<lb/>sided platform encompassing drugstore retailers, man-<lb/>ufacturers, and service providers in Brazil. Currently, it <lb/>supports 58 small and medium-sized drugstore chains, <lb/>comprising approximately 14,000 stores serving all <lb/>Brazilian states in 2,832 cities and generating a com-<lb/>bined revenue of around US$ 32 billion annually -an <lb/>impactful figure in the Brazilian market. <lb/>Despite currently presenting relevant and even <lb/>superlative numbers for the Brazilian market, arriving <lb/>at the current highly refined and well-oiled business <lb/>model constituted a journey of several years of intense <lb/>intellectual and practical effort that is worth analyzing. <lb/>THEORETICAL REVIEW <lb/>Multisided platforms as a coopetition <lb/>organizational form to cocreate value <lb/>According to Cozzolino et al. (2017), coopetition is a <lb/>strategic choice. It emphasizes the integration of com-<lb/>petition and cooperation as a method to enhance <lb/>innovative capabilities, to leverage complementary <lb/>assets being beneficial for sharing the risks and costs, <lb/>especially when it comes to innovation activities. <lb/>These authors also state that coopetition also leads to <lb/>increased innovation outputs, as it enables firms to find <lb/>new combinations of knowledge and capabilities that <lb/>might not be possible in purely competitive or cooper-<lb/>ative scenarios. <lb/>Platforms have transformed how companies gen-<lb/>erate value for customers and compete in the market. <lb/>Cennamo (2021) highlights this evolution, emphasizing <lb/>the role of platforms in altering traditional business dy-<lb/>namics and, consequently, value creation. <lb/>The recent trends of business toward digital plat-<lb/>form-based ecosystems show how cooperation and <lb/>competition is a solution to gain competitive advan-<lb/>tage. These multisided platforms have had a significant <lb/>impact on the strategic approach of firms in various do-<lb/>mains, such as social networks, internet marketplaces, <lb/>and media (Cozzolino et al., 2021). These platforms act <lb/>as intermediaries, facilitating compatibility and interac-<lb/>tion in B2B and BTC contexts. They serve as a bridge <lb/>between two or more &apos;sides&apos; that otherwise would not <lb/>be able to easily engage with each other (Cusumano <lb/>et al., 2020; Hagiu, 2014; McIntyre &amp; Srinivasan, 2017; <lb/>Rochet &amp; Tirole, 2003; Thomas et al., 2014). <lb/></body>

        <body>Multisided platforms, as Evans and Schmalensee <lb/>(2013) explain, orchestrate demand among various <lb/>interdependent customer groups, forming ecosys-<lb/>tems for value co-creation. These ecosystems typ-<lb/>ically comprise a variety of stakeholders, including <lb/>demand-side participants, suppliers, and governance <lb/>entities, which collectively facilitate the creation of val-<lb/>ue for all members. <lb/>An important aspect of multisided platforms is that <lb/>no side of the platform will join without the other or <lb/>others (Hagiu, 2014). As a result, it is common that <lb/>most multisided platforms subsidize at least one side <lb/>of their platform (demand side) to attract other partici-<lb/>pants (supply side). Multisided platforms also encounter <lb/>transversal network effects (Carrillo &amp; Tan, 2021), where <lb/>demand from one side boosts participation from the <lb/>other. Network effect refers to the phenomenon where <lb/>the value of a product or service increases as more <lb/>people use it (Granfeldt &amp; Nyqvist, 2019). Figure 1, be-<lb/>low, shows the possible network effects on a three-sid-<lb/>ed platform (Øverby &amp; Audestad, 2021, p. 6). <lb/>User Group A <lb/>User Group B <lb/>User Group C <lb/>Same-side <lb/>network <lb/>effects <lb/>Same-side <lb/>network <lb/>effects <lb/>Service delivery and <lb/>mediation <lb/>Same-side network effects <lb/>Multisided <lb/>platform <lb/>Cross-side network effects <lb/>Source: Øverby, H., &amp; Audestad, J. A. (2021). Multisided platforms: Classification and analysis. Systems, 9(85), 1-23. https://doi.org/10.3390/systems. <lb/>Figure 1. A multisided platform featuring three user groups (A, B, and C) and the potential network effects. <lb/>Although platforms have been the subject of re-<lb/>search for some time, the presence of several typol-<lb/>ogies and taxonomies indicates that platforms rep-<lb/>resent a phenomenon that calls for better in-depth <lb/>investigation (refer to Table 1). <lb/>The evolving dynamics of competitive strategy in <lb/>the context of platform adoption, and understanding <lb/>the ramifications of scaling on competition, necessi-<lb/>tate further investigation. Managing interactions and <lb/>dependencies among diverse groups on multisided <lb/>platforms is essential for sustaining a balanced eco-<lb/>system that benefits all participants and maintains <lb/>network effects, even when one side comprises solely <lb/>competitors. <lb/>Research efforts also need to address how tech-<lb/>nology can overcome existing architectural and gov-<lb/>ernance obstacles, transform current value-creating <lb/>interactions, rectify misaligned incentive structures, <lb/>and tackle various labor issues that multisided plat-<lb/>forms introduce (Constantinides et al., 2018). <lb/>Additionally, scholarship should delineate clear <lb/>methods to address inherent issues within multisided <lb/>platforms, such as selecting the primary stakeholders <lb/>of the platform, resolving the &apos;chicken-or-egg&apos; problem <lb/>to initiate crucial network effects for growth and sus-<lb/>tainability, formulating a sustainable business model, <lb/>and establishing and upholding rules to prevent mis-<lb/>use, thereby ensuring an effective and well-governed <lb/>platform ecosystem (Cusumano et al., 2020). <lb/></body>

        <body>The cycle of value in multisided <lb/>platforms business model <lb/>Multisided platform is a business model that can serve <lb/>as a solution to the intricate challenge related to val-<lb/>ue creation, configuration, and appropriation within an <lb/>ecosystem characterized by multifaceted services and <lb/>diverse value perspectives from various stakeholders. <lb/>Within a multisided platform, each group of participants <lb/>constitutes a substantial customer (Hagiu, 2014), ac-<lb/>tively involved in value co-creation processes (Oliveira <lb/>&amp; Cortimiglia, 2017). At the same time, participant firms <lb/>on a multisided platform may be able to capture val-<lb/>ue through knowledge produced by other participants <lb/>of the platform. Nevertheless, the journey toward a <lb/>value-centric multisided platform is replete with intri-<lb/>cacies and challenges, particularly in deciphering the <lb/>accurate mechanisms of governance in value configu-<lb/>ration and also of value appropriation. <lb/>According to Meirelles (2019), the construction of a <lb/>business model derives from entrepreneurs&apos; intercon-<lb/>nections as they navigate through the intricacies of <lb/>value creation, configuration, and appropriation pre-<lb/>dicaments (refer to Figure 2). These interconnections <lb/>fundamentally embody a dialectical process (Van de <lb/>Ven, 2007) rooted in the internal quandaries that arise <lb/>amongst stakeholders -whether internal among <lb/>members and partners or external between the com-<lb/>pany and the market. This process-oriented approach <lb/>harmonizes seamlessly with the coopetition observed <lb/>within the context of multisided platforms business <lb/>model, since the inherent tensions and conflicts are in-<lb/>tricately linked to the paradoxical nature of &apos;coopetitive&apos; <lb/>strategies. <lb/>Table 1 (continued) <lb/>Authors <lb/>Classification subject <lb/>Classes <lb/>Reimers et al.

        <note place="footnote">BAR-Brazilian Administration Review, 21(1), e230099, 2024. <lb/></note>

        <body>Coopetition&apos; is a concept that embodies the simulta-<lb/>neous occurrence of cooperation and competition be-<lb/>tween firms (Bengtsson &amp; Johansson, 2014; Jakobsen, <lb/>2020; Raza-Ullah, 2018; Raza-Ullah et al., 2014; Seepana <lb/>et al., 2020). This paradoxical relationship arises from <lb/>the coexistence of collective interests to create greater <lb/>value (cooperation aspect) alongside the pursuit of pri-<lb/>vate gains from the value created (competition aspect). <lb/>This dynamic leads to the creation and appropriation <lb/>of value in various contexts (Oliveira-Ribeiro &amp; Chim-<lb/>Miki, 2022). <lb/>The comprehension of the mechanisms of coop-<lb/>etition involves the analysis of the trade-offs between <lb/>joint value creation and firm value creation (Gnyawali <lb/>&amp; Charleton, 2018). <lb/>Precisely because coopetition is characterized by <lb/>the coexistence of convergent interests (favorable to <lb/>cooperation) and divergent interests (inducing compe-<lb/>tition), it brings tensions and ambiguities that call for <lb/>solutions. Mohamed et al. (2023) point out that ambi-<lb/>guities and tensions may arise from unbalanced lead-<lb/>ership power, which may impede the establishment <lb/>of collective governance agreements, especially when <lb/>incumbents in a coopetition setting impose its gov-<lb/>ernance to maintain market dominance and prevent <lb/>sudden competition. Ambiguities and tensions may <lb/>also stem from the multi-layered nature of coopetition, <lb/>knowledge sharing, and when the balance between <lb/>complementarity and competition among platforms is <lb/>unclear, leading to potential conflicts. <lb/>One of the biggest challenges on a multisided <lb/>platform is to overcome the resistance and conflict-<lb/>ing interests among potential constituents. Tensions <lb/>may arise in such situation due to disputes regard-<lb/>ing who has produced the knowledge and who gets <lb/>the actual benefits of it (Chanal &amp; Caron-Fasan, 2010, <lb/>p. 318). Another tricky issue is that the customers of <lb/>a multisided platform should be complementary to <lb/>avoid conflicts of interest (Carrillo &amp; Tan, 2021; Evans <lb/>&amp; Schmalensee, 2013), no side will engage without the <lb/>presence of others. <lb/>Other tensions may arise from the lack of trust be-<lb/>tween coopeting firms, opportunistic behavior, knowl-<lb/>edge exposure, and cultural gaps, and the scope and <lb/>timeframe of the coopetition, when clearly delim-<lb/>ited, can lead to tensions regarding the distribution <lb/>of responsibilities and benefits (Kalanit et al. 2022). <lb/>Despite the coopetition advantages, the similarity in <lb/>resource and knowledge domains between competi-<lb/>tors in a &apos;coopetitive&apos; relationship can pose challenges <lb/>(Cozzolino et al., 2017). Another important aspect that <lb/>may bring tensions is related to the need to balance <lb/>the positive and negative interdependencies with key <lb/>actors in the ecosystem (Cozzolino et al., 2021). <lb/>Despite these problems, several authors explain that <lb/>platforms constitute an effective coopetitive mecha-<lb/>nism to create value. Mohamed et al. (2023) and Yoo <lb/>et al. (2022) highlight balancing cooperation and com-<lb/>petition in platform ecosystems, managing tensions <lb/>and enhancing relationships among firms. Czakon and <lb/>Rogalski (2014) explain that coopetition creates value <lb/>by enabling firms to pool resources, to develop com-<lb/>plementary activities, and share risks to achieve com-<lb/>petitive advantage over other market actors. Ritala and <lb/>Sainio (2014) complement the previous authors explor-<lb/>ing how coopetition creates value, particularly in the <lb/>context of radical innovation, a context that enables <lb/>firms to combine their similar and complementary re-<lb/>sources for joint value creation, thereby sharing risks <lb/>and costs of innovation activities. <lb/>The functionality of multisided platforms revolves <lb/>around three key aspects: the interdependence of <lb/>various customer groups, their facilitated interactions, <lb/>and the reliance on the platform to catalyze mutually <lb/>beneficial interactions. Such platforms generate value <lb/>through network externalities, stemming from network <lb/>effects or side effects. The value of a product or service <lb/>on these platforms increases with user participation, <lb/>underlining the importance of understanding network. <lb/>Stabell and Fjeldstad (1998) compare a platform&apos;s <lb/>function to a value network, coordinating stakehold-<lb/>ers through various interventions. The platform&apos;s ef-<lb/>fectiveness hinges on addressing coordination and <lb/>transaction costs, where each customer group&apos;s wel-<lb/>fare impacts the others (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013). <lb/>Ceccagnoli et al. (2012) stress the importance of com-<lb/>patibility, avoiding investment duplication, and robust <lb/>intellectual property rights in enabling efficient value <lb/>co-creation within these ecosystems. <lb/>Rochet and Tirole (2003; 2006) suggest a combined <lb/>membership and usage fee model to resolve proper-<lb/>ty rights issues, aligning with Coase&apos;s theorem (Coase, <lb/>1960). However, this perspective may not fully capture <lb/>the dynamic nature of platform evolution and compe-<lb/>tition, as noted by Gawer (2014). Gawer (2014) also cri-<lb/>tiques the technological view of platforms, proposing a <lb/>resilient architecture that innovates through modules <lb/>and interfaces, adapting to customer needs. Platform <lb/>coordinators should facilitate rather than intervene in <lb/>negotiations to maintain neutrality and maximize val-<lb/>ue realization. The platform&apos;s success depends on its <lb/>liquidity, influencing its attractiveness to buyers and <lb/>sellers (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013). <lb/>In innovative ecosystems, anchor tenants like uni-<lb/>versities and public research organizations (Clarysse et <lb/></body>

As demon-<lb/>strated next, this is exemplified by FEBRAFAR, operat-<lb/>ing within the fiercely competitive market of drugstore <lb/>chains. <lb/>METHOD <lb/>This is a case study paper of FEBRAFAR, a multisided <lb/>platform that interconnects various stakeholders (re-<lb/>tailers, manufacturers, dealers, and service providers) <lb/>within the Brazilian drugstore retail industry. Employing <lb/>Yin&apos;s (2008) protocol, the research leveraged primary <lb/>and secondary data sources (refer to Table 2). <lb/>Primary data collection was conducted through <lb/>in-depth semi-structured interviews with three ex-<lb/>ecutives, including the CEO himself and two direc-<lb/>tors of the organization, and one lawyer. Field ob-<lb/>servations were conducted through participation <lb/>at two conferences where we had conversations <lb/>with approximately 20 employees from the general <lb/>staff, including managers, coordinators, and analysts. <lb/>The total amount of interviews and filed observa-<lb/>tions is approximately 50 hours spent on a dozen <lb/>on-site visits over a period of about 12 months. The <lb/>interviews and meetings were conducted through <lb/>in-person visits to the organization, the use of video <lb/>conferences, and telephone calls. <lb/>The secondary data sources encompassed a <lb/>published historical account of the organization <lb/>(Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016) and its official website, <lb/>including FARMARCAS website, a spin-off from <lb/>FEBRAFAR. In addition, various documents were <lb/>consulted, such as institutional videos, videos from <lb/>the FEBRAFAR channel on the YouTube website, and <lb/>drugstore management artifacts, such as electronic <lb/>spreadsheets and information systems. <lb/>The technique deployed to analyze data is nar-<lb/>rative (Feldman et al., 2004), facilitating the iden-<lb/>tification of problems and solutions to value con-<lb/>figuration, creation, and appropriation (Meirelles &amp; <lb/>Thomaz, 2018). Data analysis was performed with <lb/>the assistance of NVivo 11 software for data coding <lb/>and analysis. No artificial intelligence resources were <lb/>used in this study except for a spelling and grammar <lb/>checker (Grammarly) to enhance the text quality. <lb/>Data source <lb/>Type of data <lb/>Use in analysis <lb/>(1) Primary data <lb/>(interviews and field <lb/>observations) <lb/>• Five interviews (approximately 25 hours): four at FEBRAFAR <lb/>(CEO, two directors, and a manager) and one lawyer hired to <lb/>solve legal issues. <lb/>• Two conferences held on FEBRAFAR (registered in video, <lb/>each lasting approximately 2 hours) to discuss the company&apos;s <lb/>business model. <lb/>• Search for information about FEBRAFAR&apos;s business model, how <lb/>the organization works and issues regarding its operations. <lb/>• Gaining insights into how FEBRAFAR can foster collaboration <lb/>among competitors, including drugstore chains, <lb/>manufacturers, product distributors, and service providers. <lb/>(2) Secondary data <lb/>(archival) <lb/>Websites: <lb/>• FEBRAFAR <lb/>• FARMARCAS <lb/>Videos: <lb/>• 25 videos published on the internet totaling about 30 hours of <lb/>recording. <lb/>Press coverage: <lb/>• 14 articles covering the period of 2017 to 2022 published by <lb/>newspapers, business magazines, and internet news portals <lb/>(O Estado de S.

        <body>of value creation, configuration, and appropriation <lb/>(Meirelles, 2019) reverberating to the platform itself. <lb/>From its inception, the organization has assumed <lb/>a role extending beyond just being a consortium <lb/>of drugstores with significant negotiating power in <lb/>commercial transactions, giving rise to a network ef-<lb/>fect (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013; Hagiu, 2014). The <lb/>platform fundamentally embodies the identification <lb/>of value-creation opportunities (Meirelles, 2019). Its <lb/>core mission has consistently involved sharing suc-<lb/>cessful experiences, disseminating relevant informa-<lb/>tion, acting as a foundation for strategic planning, <lb/>and providing unique services to its members. <lb/>As defined by Meirelles (2019), value configura-<lb/>tion entails the process of operationalizing oppor-<lb/>tunities by orchestrating resources and activities <lb/>both internally and externally, thereby pursuing a <lb/>dynamic and streamlined value framework in align-<lb/>ment with the organization&apos;s evolutionary trajectory. <lb/>Furthermore, value configuration entails an ongoing <lb/>enhancement of the quality of interactions among <lb/>participants within the multisided platform. These <lb/>connections serve as conduits for the involved par-<lb/>ties to uncover optimal solutions tailored to their <lb/>respective needs (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. 8). <lb/>The initial hurdle was securing essential resourc-<lb/>es. One manufacturer, Eurofarma, notably exhibited <lb/>keen interest in spearheading a novel entity with <lb/>nationwide coverage. As a result, garnering resourc-<lb/>es found an early resolution through the patronage <lb/>extended by drug manufacturers. However, this <lb/>marked just the inception of the journey toward <lb/>cultivating an integrated network. It was, therefore, <lb/>imperative to bridge both platform facets: unit-<lb/>ing entrepreneurs affiliated with small and medi-<lb/>um-sized drugstore chains alongside manufacturers <lb/>and dealers. The groundwork for a solution was laid <lb/>with a convergence-driven meeting orchestrated to <lb/>align diverse interests. This gathering facilitated the <lb/>engagement of CEOs and directors from associat-<lb/>ed drugstore chains, fostering negotiations that in-<lb/>volved manufacturers and distributors. <lb/>The inaugural event encompassed deliberations <lb/>and presentations addressing topics such as generic <lb/>drugs. The triumph of this occasion effectively chart-<lb/>ed the course for FEBRAFAR: disseminating pertinent <lb/>market insights to its members to preempt trends <lb/>and sustain competitiveness, even amidst transfor-<lb/>mative shifts. The efficacy of this model proved so <lb/>substantial that it continues to be embraced to this <lb/>day, materializing in biennial convention cycles. <lb/>A larger influx of buyers inherently draws in a <lb/>more significant number of suppliers and vice versa, <lb/>amplifying the intrinsic worth of the platform. When <lb/>constructive feedback loops emerge amongst the <lb/>diverse customer categories within the platform, <lb/>heightened demand from each group contributes to <lb/>elevating the platform&apos;s value. Consequently, foster-<lb/>ing these favorable feedback loops becomes a crucial <lb/>facet of value configuration, achieved through the <lb/>unwavering commitment to customer contentment. <lb/>Initiatives such as implementing best management <lb/>practices manifest in augmented sales and revenue <lb/>alongside mitigated financial losses, encompassing <lb/>aspects like lessening tax burden. Nevertheless, a <lb/>challenge emerged as resistance toward embracing <lb/>optimal management practices. <lb/>The initiative to introduce these practices was <lb/>set in motion during an event focused on outlining <lb/>the future activities of the &apos;Brazil Farma&apos; Committee. <lb/>Tamascia, the head of FEBRAFAR, engaged in a col-<lb/>laborative session orchestrated by management <lb/>specialists, and the outcome generated substantial <lb/>interest, prompting him to introduce the methodolo-<lb/>gy to fellow FEBRAFAR members. Notably, Tamascia <lb/>authored a comprehensive document addressing <lb/>all participating drugstore chains, underscoring the <lb/>requisite managerial modifications imperative for <lb/>realizing the targeted objectives. Each drugstore <lb/>chain received this document, culminating in a sub-<lb/>sequent meeting convened to approve these pro-<lb/>posed changes. Subsequently, the drugstore chains <lb/>acquired a definitive guiding compass (Tamascia &amp; <lb/>Corbó, 2016). <lb/>Nonetheless, effecting the diffusion of nov-<lb/>el practices was not a straightforward endeavor. <lb/>Generally characterized as family-run businesses <lb/>established among acquaintances, small and me-<lb/>dium-sized drugstore chains encountered initial <lb/>reservations toward embracing the management <lb/>practices endorsed by FEBRAFAR. The provision of <lb/>these services required a focused effort toward legit-<lb/>imization, which included developing research ini-<lb/>tiatives and engaging in collaborative ventures with <lb/>respected institutions, as well as conducting audits. <lb/>These efforts were directed toward validating and <lb/>demonstrating the effectiveness of the provided ad-<lb/>ministrative methods and tools, using empirical data <lb/>and statistical evidence. <lb/></body>

Developed by the authors. <lb/>An alternative strategy to enhance adherence <lb/>to more effective management practices at drug-<lb/>stores entailed establishing a new drugstore chain, <lb/>FARMARCAS, which demonstrated consistently supe-<lb/>rior performance compared to its competitors. Joining <lb/>this network requires drugstore owners to comply with <lb/>the tools and best practices provided by FEBRAFAR. <lb/>Additionally, pursuing optimal management practic-<lb/>es engenders an ongoing commitment to training. In <lb/>this regard, FEBRAFAR gave rise to the IFEPEC (Institute <lb/>for Research and Continuing Education), a dedicated <lb/>arena designed to cater to the perennial demand for <lb/>enhancing drugstore entrepreneurs&apos; qualifications and <lb/>professional competence. Through a series of business <lb/>management education initiatives, the institute stands <lb/>resolute in its mission to disseminate expertise about <lb/>the paramount management practices (Tamascia &amp; <lb/>Corbó, 2016, p. 121). <lb/>A constellation of dilemmas concerning compet-<lb/>itive circumstances was equally a notable challenge <lb/>regarding value appropriation, which includes pricing <lb/>strategies (Meirelles, 2019). Small and medium-sized <lb/>drugstore chains lack the competitive leverage wielded <lb/>by their larger counterparts to engage in price negoti-<lb/>ations with manufacturers. In response, FEBRAFAR in-<lb/>stituted an initiative called Fonte Saúde (Health Source), <lb/>aimed at engendering more favorable negotiation dy-<lb/>namics. Furthermore, as part of its commitment to the <lb/>holistic well-being of all stakeholders, FEBRAFAR ex-<lb/>tends support to transactions executed between drug-<lb/>stores and manufacturers. Operating on a dual-front <lb/>approach, FEBRAFAR aggregates the cumulative prod-<lb/>uct demands voiced by drugstore chains, subsequently <lb/>sharing this consolidated data with manufacturers and <lb/>dealers. In parallel, the platform compiles and com-<lb/>pares the quotations submitted by manufacturers and <lb/>dealers, furnishing the drugstores with the most ad-<lb/>vantageous terms. Simultaneously, manufacturers and <lb/>dealers proffer appreciable discounts to drugstores, <lb/>who reciprocate by furnishing strategic insights on <lb/>product sales, thus engendering a symbiotic exchange <lb/>(Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016, p. 46). <lb/>The operationalization of this initiative demanded <lb/>the digitalization of drugstore operations. The sales <lb/>data reports produced by drugstores, a predominantly <lb/>manual undertaking, culminated in a voluminous ac-<lb/>cumulation extending to hundreds of pages. &quot;We could <lb/>not present the data in that format to drug manufactur-<lb/>ers. Nobody would buy it&quot; (Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016, p. <lb/>49). To render this endeavor viable, a company named <lb/>BRASFANTA undertook the sponsorship of procuring <lb/>hundreds of computers. In the nascent stages, a man-<lb/>ual procedure was employed to consolidate the final <lb/>tallies, involving the utilization of Excel spreadsheets for <lb/>each merchandise item. <lb/>Notably, the endeavor to enhance value appropria-<lb/>tion for FEBRAFAR&apos;s constituents exerted a discernible <lb/>influence on the platform&apos;s value configuration. This <lb/>service provision engendered the establishment of a <lb/>dedicated commercial division, entrusted with the re-<lb/>sponsibility of orchestrating price negotiations and fos-<lb/>tering the engagement of novel suppliers. <lb/>In 2007, the Brazilian drugstore retail sector experi-<lb/>enced a swift shift toward professionalization, leading <lb/>to a demand for efficient management in drugstores, <lb/>supported by solid data and efficient operational soft-<lb/>ware. Cognizant of this void, the affiliated drugstore <lb/>chains petitioned FEBRAFAR to devise an operation-<lb/>al system that would centralize the procurement and <lb/>sales data of all drugstore chains. In response to this <lb/>entreaty, a software system was developed, denot-<lb/>ed as the Business Indicators Measurement System. <lb/>Harnessing the insights furnished by this system&apos;s data, <lb/>FEBRAFAR acquired the capacity to, for instance, mit-<lb/></body>

        <body>igate tax liabilities. &quot;We realized that several drugstores <lb/>were overpaying taxes, not due to an excessive tax bur-<lb/>den, but because of inaccuracies in accounting proce-<lb/>dures. Armed with the data gleaned from the Indicators <lb/>Measurement System, FEBRAFAR identified these dis-<lb/>crepancies and dispensed appropriate guidance. Several <lb/>retailers were able to save up to R$ 9,000.00 per month&quot; <lb/>(Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016, p. 89). <lb/>This endeavor marked the initiation of advancements <lb/>in digital transformation. A strategic competitive initiative <lb/>known as the Competitive Strategic Program introduced <lb/>an information system catering to both established play-<lb/>ers and fresh entrants. Within this framework, the drug-<lb/>store manager populates a comprehensive database <lb/>encompassing diverse variables, including payroll out-<lb/>lays, operational expenditures, and tax disbursements. <lb/>Leveraging this data repository, the system enables a <lb/>comparative analysis of the drugstore&apos;s performance vis-<lb/>à-vis its peers within the same cohort. The juxtaposition <lb/>of revenues, expenditures, and resultant outcomes en-<lb/>genders valuable insights germane to decision-making <lb/>and strategic reassessment. <lb/>With the internal framework effectively in place, <lb/>there emerged a need to appoint a manager to oversee <lb/>the management platform. At this point, an individual <lb/>with the necessary qualifications and ability to assume <lb/>this additional role was notably lacking. Consequently, <lb/>FEBRAFAR embarked on a search to find an appropriate <lb/>professional from within its network of associated drug-<lb/>store chains (Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016, pp. 88-89). <lb/>After addressing the initial challenges in creating <lb/>and appropriating value for both sides of the platform, <lb/>FEBRAFAR has successfully evolved into a well-struc-<lb/>tured multisided platform. This evolution is supported by <lb/>various funding sources, including monthly association <lb/>fees and marketing promotion fees. Participants, includ-<lb/>ing dealers, manufacturers, and service providers, can <lb/>choose from three distinct membership tiers: Level 1, of-<lb/>fering access to two annual national conferences; Level <lb/>2, which includes monthly webinars in addition to the <lb/>two annual conferences; Level 3, providing monthly we-<lb/>binars, two annual national conferences, and an annual <lb/>market research report customized for each member. <lb/>As per the encompassed literature, the utilization of <lb/>exclusive contracts emerges as a viable strategy to bind <lb/>customers (Meirelles, 2019), particularly in the presence <lb/>of competing multisided platforms. This maneuver ex-<lb/>tends benefits not solely to the clientele under the <lb/>purview of the exclusivity agreement but also rever-<lb/>berates positively onto clients belonging to other par-<lb/>ticipant groups within the multisided platform (Evans &amp; <lb/>Schmalensee, 2013, p. 30). However, despite FEBRAFAR&apos;s <lb/>status as a de facto monopoly, it abstains from imposing <lb/>exclusivity contracts. Consequently, customers retain <lb/>the capacity to access value without necessarily teth-<lb/>ering themselves to FEBRAFAR&apos;s multisided platform. <lb/>Notably, facilitating value appropriation becomes less <lb/>noticeable when opting for FEBRAFAR&apos;s multisided plat-<lb/>form. Without this multisided platform, the avenues for <lb/>value capture among the network&apos;s clientele would be <lb/>severely constrained or potentially absent altogether. <lb/>When a platform eclipses its rivals in attractiveness, it <lb/>consequently garners a more extensive customer base <lb/>and accrues more excellent value for its proprietors, es-<lb/>tablishing a quasi-monopoly that curtails competitive <lb/>forces (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. 13). FEBRAFAR <lb/>effectively stands as a multisided platform monopoly, <lb/>catering to the needs of small and medium-sized drug-<lb/>store chains within the Brazilian market. Notably, the <lb/>authors of this paper did not unearth any analogous <lb/>multisided platforms operating within the same market <lb/>niche as FEBRAFAR, specifically targeting small and me-<lb/>dium-sized chains of drugstores. In fact, there is another <lb/>multisided platform within the Brazilian drugstore do-<lb/>main: ABRAFARMA (Brazilian Association of Drugstore <lb/>Chains). However, it is pertinent to note that this entity <lb/>does not vie with FEBRAFAR. ABRAFARMA serves as an <lb/>organization that advocates for the interests of major <lb/>nationwide drugstore chains in Brazil, including industry <lb/>giants like Extrafarma, Pague Menos, Raia Drogasil, and <lb/>DPSP (Drogarias São Paulo and Drogarias Pacheco), col-<lb/>lectively amassing about 58% of the Brazilian drugstore <lb/>market share. While ABRAFARMA stands as a formidable <lb/>contender for drugstore chains, it remains distinct from <lb/>FEBRAFAR&apos;s sphere of competition. <lb/>It is equally imperative to underscore that strategic <lb/>determinations wielding an impact on the value ap-<lb/>propriation of distinct customer cohorts inevitably yield <lb/>ramifications for the capacity to extract value via the <lb/>platform (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. 11). Throughout <lb/>its 15 years of operation, FEBRAFAR has cultivated the <lb/>capability to engage with a myriad of drugstores na-<lb/>tionwide, thereby enhancing value creation and ap-<lb/>propriation for all its stakeholders. The initial challenges <lb/>of resource acquisition and intermediation have now <lb/>become historical artifacts. Presently, manufacturers <lb/>frequently allocate funds to facilitate the promotion of <lb/>their products at point-of-sale locations. In its interme-<lb/>diary role, FEBRAFAR orchestrates promotion of these <lb/>products within the drugstores affiliated with its chains. <lb/>Consequently, the association accrues remuneration <lb/>for enabling such promotional endeavors. Furthermore, <lb/>these initiatives facilitate marketing activities at the point <lb/>of sale without imposing financial burdens on the drug-<lb/>stores, amplifying the potential for value appropriation. <lb/>The outcomes of these initiatives have proven decid-<lb/></body>

        <body>edly positive. Results were quantified across product <lb/>categories. Those categories previously overlooked <lb/>or underutilized experienced sales growth up to 300% <lb/>(Tamascia &amp; Corbó, 2016, p. 77). <lb/>Aligning complementary demands across all cus-<lb/>tomer segments is a persistent value configuration en-<lb/>deavor. FEBRAFAR consistently seeks fresh liquidity pro-<lb/>viders (drugstore chains) for its customer base, thereby <lb/>ensuring a substantial clientele that upholds its monop-<lb/>olistic stance in catering to the requirements of small <lb/>and medium-sized drugstore chains within the Brazilian <lb/>market. <lb/>A multisided platform stands poised to bolster profits <lb/>by aggregating customers capable of amplifying sales <lb/>volumes (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. 14). This the-<lb/>oretical tenet finds its resonance within the context of <lb/>FEBRAFAR. An exemplification of this is evident in the in-<lb/>corporation of payment service providers into the roster <lb/>of FEBRAFAR&apos;s clientele. Services centered on payment <lb/>methods, such as the processing of credit card transac-<lb/>tions, inherently demonstrate a high degree of scalabil-<lb/>ity, given their indispensable nature to every drugstore. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>FEBRAFAR operates on a business model that engen-<lb/>ders value across an intricate web of stakeholders en-<lb/>compassing drugstore proprietors, drugstore chains, <lb/>customers, employees, dealers, manufacturers, service <lb/>providers, governmental entities, and FEBRAFAR itself. A <lb/>comprehensive analysis of the stakeholder ecosystem <lb/>within the platform (refer to Figure 3) reveals the distinct <lb/>value propositions directed at each of these constituents. <lb/>On one platform facet, stakeholders include suppliers, <lb/>dealers, manufacturers, and service providers. The value <lb/>proposition offers them privileged access to an exten-<lb/>sive network of drugstores, facilitating the provisioning <lb/>of products and services. Conversely, on the opposite <lb/>side, there are drugstore retailers, predominantly com-<lb/>prising small and medium-sized chains. The value prop-<lb/>osition for these retailers encompasses the facilitation <lb/>of proficient drugstore management based on business <lb/>intelligence, leveraging established methodologies, and <lb/>cultivating competitive edges via initiatives like prod-<lb/>uct sales campaigns and market research. In return, the <lb/>drugstores furnish manufacturers and distributors with <lb/>pertinent information. <lb/>It should be noted that FEBRAFAR is not a digital plat-<lb/>form akin to a website where drugstore networks create <lb/>accounts to become affiliates. Nor is it a digital multilat-<lb/>eral platform similar to social networks like Facebook or <lb/>B2B digital platforms such as Alibaba, Amazon Business, <lb/>or ThomasNet. FEBRAFAR does maintain an institutional <lb/>website and various computerized systems to support <lb/>its operations, which clients access for certain services. <lb/>However, its primary services are rendered through di-<lb/>rectly facilitating advantageous offers for its participants, <lb/>via negotiations between drugstore networks and its <lb/>suppliers, processing and analyzing drugstore perfor-<lb/>mance data, and continuously promoting virtual and <lb/>in-person meetings for the exchange of experiences <lb/>and best practices among drugstore chains and its prod-<lb/>uct and service providers. <lb/>This finding not only contributes to the theoretical <lb/>understanding of multisided platforms but also offers <lb/>practical insights, from a managerial perspective, into <lb/>the establishment of a multilateral platform business <lb/>model.

        <body>This research highlights the strategic considerations <lb/>necessary for effectively managing coopetition and <lb/>fostering a mutually beneficial environment among <lb/>competitors in a multisided platform context. To con-<lb/>sistently align small and medium-sized regional drug-<lb/>store chains with the prevailing landscape and mar-<lb/>ket dynamics, this multisided platform systematically <lb/>seeks out advice from researchers and market analy-<lb/>ses concerning optimal strategies, emerging business <lb/>prospects, novel technologies, products, and services, <lb/>as well as collaborative networks. Teece (2017) pre-<lb/>sented a comprehensive four-stage framework (birth, <lb/>expansion, leadership, and self-renewal) designed to <lb/>illuminate the essential considerations for nurturing the <lb/>evolution of a platform throughout its distinct life cycle <lb/>phases. Drawing from this perspective, it becomes ev-<lb/>ident that the trajectory of FEBRAFAR is characterized <lb/>by an ongoing stream of emerging challenges. <lb/>Despite the accomplishments inherent to <lb/>FEBRAFAR&apos;s business model, it confronts persistent <lb/>challenges. As pointed out by Mercado &amp; Consumo <lb/>(2020), &quot;with an index of 32%, the Brazilian pharma-<lb/>ceutical retail is one of the least concentrated in the <lb/>sector in the Americas.&quot; Nevertheless, a discernible <lb/>growth trajectory characterizes the Brazilian drugstore <lb/>retail sector (Vito, 2021). Noteworthy is the entry of the <lb/>North American company CVS into the Brazilian market <lb/>through the acquisition of the drugstore chain Onofre <lb/>between 2013 and 2019. Although CVS subsequent-<lb/>ly exited the Brazilian market in 2019 (Estadão, 2019) <lb/>this acquisition underscored the allure of the Brazilian <lb/>drugstore retail sector to foreign corporations. The po-<lb/>tential advent of other foreign entrants in the Brazilian <lb/>market could exert heightened pressure on FEBRAFAR <lb/>and its associated stakeholders. <lb/>FEBRAFAR&apos;s predominant stance engenders chal-<lb/>lenges for prospective competitors in the multisided <lb/>platform landscape. The CEO of the organization ac-<lb/>knowledges that endeavors to establish rival platforms <lb/>have been undertaken. Nevertheless, these endeavors <lb/>have thus far met with limited success. This predica-<lb/>ment stems from the network&apos;s cascading effects -a <lb/>manifestation wherein a surge in participants&apos; interest <lb/>to join gains momentum. This phenomenon is com-<lb/>pounded by the existing plethora of participants on the <lb/>platform. Consequently, this dynamic substantiates a <lb/>formidable entry impediment for prospective multisid-<lb/>ed platforms (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. 19). <lb/>Another pertinent consideration involves the phe-<lb/>nomenon of multi-homing. This phenomenon emerg-<lb/>es when a multisided platform does not maintain a <lb/>monopoly. Multi-homing denotes the practice of cus-<lb/>tomers utilizing more than one platform. Consequently, <lb/>the platform necessitates differentiating its array of <lb/>products and services (Evans &amp; Schmalensee, 2013, p. <lb/>19). Despite FEBRAFAR&apos;s monopolistic standing within <lb/>its market segment (small and medium-sized drug-<lb/>store chains), the potential for multi-homing cannot <lb/>be discounted if another platform were to successfully <lb/>penetrate the Brazilian market, offering enhanced ser-<lb/>vices and a larger customer base. Hence, FEBRAFAR&apos;s <lb/>enduring existence within its monopolistic context at-<lb/>tests to the robustness of its business model. An exem-<lb/>plar of this accomplishment is INTERPLAYERS, a spin-<lb/>off originating from a drugstore chain nurtured under <lb/>FEBRAFAR&apos;s auspices. This entity devised a data con-<lb/>solidation solution, employed by select drugstore retail <lb/>chains affiliated with FEBRAFAR. <lb/>Finally, it is imperative to underscore the significance <lb/>of governance mechanisms in curbing opportunis-<lb/>tic behavior. Scholars such as Evans (2012) and Hagiu <lb/>(2009) elucidate the necessity of a robust governance <lb/>framework to mitigate opportunistic conduct among <lb/>the platform&apos;s clientele. Such behavior not only erodes <lb/>the platform&apos;s credibility but also diminishes the poten-<lb/>tial for value capture, both for the multisided platform <lb/>and its customers. A multisided platform should facil-<lb/>itate direct interaction among its participants (Hagiu, <lb/>2014). Nonetheless, the role of the multisided platform <lb/>coordinator should strictly be that of a facilitator, re-<lb/>fraining from intervening in negotiations. Since trans-<lb/>actions occur directly between suppliers and buyers, <lb/>FEBRAFAR has not established a distinct governance <lb/>framework aimed at preventing opportunistic behavior <lb/>across all customer groups. To date, the need for such <lb/>a governance structure has not arisen. <lb/>The bedrock of FEBRAFAR&apos;s achievements is unde-<lb/>niably the foresight and capabilities of its CEO, Edison <lb/>Tamascia. Nonetheless, in the coming years, the orga-<lb/>nization will inevitably face the challenge of leadership <lb/>transition. Navigating the succession of an immensely <lb/>successful CEO is a complex undertaking. <lb/>Another FEBRAFAR&apos;S challenge lies in achiev-<lb/>ing growth and diversification in a cohesive manner. <lb/>Despite the backing of FEBRAFAR, not all drugstore <lb/>chains can achieve uniform expansion across Brazil. <lb/>As attested by one of FEBRAFAR&apos;s directors, certain re-<lb/>gions, such as the southern part of Brazil, display resis-<lb/>tance to the entry of drugstore chains originating from <lb/>other regions of the country. <lb/>The FARMARCAS spin-off constitutes another <lb/>drugstore chain within the ecosystem nurtured by <lb/>FEBRAFAR. Notably, FARMARCAS is demonstrating a <lb/>more rapid growth trajectory compared to the other <lb/>drugstore chains that benefit from FEBRAFAR&apos;s support. <lb/>It is noteworthy that both FEBRAFAR and FARMARCAS <lb/></body>

        <body>are overseen by the same executive team, led by CEO <lb/>Edison Tamascia. As the expansion of FARMARCAS <lb/>gains momentum, FEBRAFAR&apos;s executives will need <lb/>to allocate their attention between these two distinct <lb/>entities. Existing scholarly literature underscores that in <lb/>a multisided platform, the collective well-being of all <lb/>participants is a pivotal factor for its triumph (Evans &amp; <lb/>Schmalensee, 2013, p. 11). Nevertheless, if FARMARCAS <lb/>continues its current growth trajectory, there exists a <lb/>potential risk of the executive team&apos;s attention becom-<lb/>ing disproportionately skewed toward this new venture <lb/>at the expense of other FEBRAFAR&apos;s stakeholders. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>This study elucidates how FEBRAFAR surmounted chal-<lb/>lenges to establish a thriving multisided platform within <lb/>the Brazilian drugstore retail sector. Functioning as a <lb/>multisided platform, FEBRAFAR&apos;s value proposition en-<lb/>hances the economic and financial outcomes of small <lb/>and medium-sized drugstore chains, while simultane-<lb/>ously facilitating lucrative interactions for distributors, <lb/>manufacturers, and service providers. Furthermore, the <lb/>platform fosters improved price negotiation and pay-<lb/>ment terms, a benefit extended to dealers and man-<lb/>ufacturers due to the extensive network of drugstores <lb/>it encompasses. The outcome is a mutually beneficial <lb/>situation for competing drugstore chains that engage <lb/>in &apos;coopetition&apos; within the platform. <lb/>By establishing clear rules and interaction proto-<lb/>cols, a multisided platform can facilitate coordination <lb/>among competing entities, thereby enabling collabora-<lb/>tive value co-creation for all involved stakeholders. This <lb/>finding contributes to the broader understanding of <lb/>strategic management in multisided platforms, partic-<lb/>ularly in non-technology contexts. Even in the absence <lb/>of a technological foundation, operating outside the in-<lb/>formation technology sector, a multisided platform can <lb/>effectively navigate the complexities of value creation <lb/>in a coopetitive environment. <lb/>While the FEBRAFAR business model has demon-<lb/>strated considerable efficacy within the retail drugstore <lb/>sector, its principles, at least theoretically, hold poten-<lb/>tial for broader applicability. The replicability of the <lb/>FEBRAFAR model is particularly fitted to contexts where <lb/>smaller entities form a significant portion of the de-<lb/>mand side for services and products, and where there <lb/>exists a corresponding supply side comprising diverse <lb/>product and service providers. This includes a range of <lb/>retail and service provider establishments, like beauty <lb/>clinics, bakeries, restaurants, and retail in general. <lb/>This study presents an evident limitation: it is a case <lb/>study focused solely on the experience of a single and <lb/>unique organization operating within the Brazilian <lb/>business environment. The research does not encom-<lb/>pass information on other types of businesses beyond <lb/>drugstores chains and their suppliers of products and <lb/>services. Additionally, the study does not address mul-<lb/>tilateral platforms in other countries. While the focal <lb/>multilateral platform may potentially be effective in <lb/>other business sectors and national contexts, it is clear <lb/>that the specific characteristics of each market could <lb/>influence the effectiveness of a multilateral platform <lb/>like the one described. Therefore, it is evident that the <lb/>results of this research cannot be generalized. <lb/>In terms of future research directions concerning <lb/>multilateral platforms, there are numerous possibilities. <lb/>Proposed areas for future investigation on multisided <lb/>platforms akin to FEBRAFAR include, but are not limited <lb/>to, the following: <lb/>FEBRAFAR is a multilateral platform that leverages <lb/>technology to support its operations and those of <lb/>its participants. However, FEBRAFAR is not a digi-<lb/>tal platform per se. Despite this fact, one can envi-<lb/>sion a transition of the FEBRAFAR platform toward <lb/>a more digital format, with increased service auto-<lb/>mation and a more automated process for affiliat-<lb/>ing drugstore chains (demand side) and suppliers <lb/>(supply side). This could be particularly important in <lb/>economic sectors where demand-side players are <lb/>simpler entities unable to afford significant platform <lb/>fees. In this context, digitalization of the platform <lb/>may present an attractive option. In such context, <lb/>identifying the critical success factors for creating a <lb/>more digitally inclined platform is a crucial task. <lb/>The study did not identify issues regarding oppor-<lb/>tunistic behavior within the FEBRAFAR&apos;s multisid-<lb/>ed platform, nor did it detect sophisticated formal <lb/>mechanisms for dispute resolution among partici-<lb/>pants. However, this does not imply that such issues <lb/>should not be addressed through rigorous scientific <lb/>analysis to get to a better understanding on how to <lb/>prevent conflicts. <lb/>A crucial aspect underlying FEBRAFAR&apos;s success is <lb/>its knowledge regarding drugstore management, <lb/>product distribution, and service provision. With the <lb/>emergence of new artificial intelligence technolo-<lb/>gies, the role of this new technology will be an un-<lb/>deniably important research topic. <lb/>Currently, FEBRAFAR operates nearly as a monopoly <lb/>within its market niche, facing minimal competition. <lb/>However, as one of FEBRAFAR&apos;s directors has indi-<lb/>cated, initiatives for similar platforms are emerging. <lb/></body>
