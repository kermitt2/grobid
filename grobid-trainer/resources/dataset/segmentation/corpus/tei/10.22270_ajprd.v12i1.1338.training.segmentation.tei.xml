Meanwhile, most children&apos;s oral hygiene (49.4%) was in the poor category. The <lb/>results of the correlation test showed (p-value) that the child&apos;s oral hygiene with the mother&apos;s <lb/>education = 0.000, the mother&apos;s occupation = 0.001, the mother&apos;s exposure to information = <lb/>0.000, the family&apos;s income = 0.014, and the mother&apos;s age = 0.596. In the correlation test between <lb/>the mother&apos;s actions in maintaining her child&apos;s oral health and the children&apos;s oral hygiene, it <lb/>was found that p-value = 0.000. <lb/>Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between maternal characteristics which include: <lb/>education, occupation, family income, and the mother&apos;s actions. Meanwhile, the mother&apos;s age is <lb/>not significantly related to the mother&apos;s actions. There is a significant relationship between the <lb/>mother&apos;s actions in maintaining her child&apos;s oral health and the oral hygiene of primary school-<lb/>aged children. <lb/>Keywords: characteristic, perspective actions, oral hygiene <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Parents, especially mothers, have an important role in <lb/>maintaining the oral health of elementary school-aged children. <lb/>Parental concern can be seen from their attitude and attention <lb/>to their child&apos;s oral health 1 . Oral health in elementary school-<lb/>aged children is one factor in children&apos;s growth and <lb/>development that needs to be considered. A study states that in <lb/>the last decade, health services, including dental and oral health, <lb/>have prioritized prevention rather than treatment of disease 2 . <lb/>It is therefore important to realize that prevention of dental <lb/>disease plays an important role in a patient&apos;s overall health care. <lb/>Tooth decay that occurs in children can be one of the causes of <lb/>disrupted children&apos;s tooth growth at a later age 3 . Preventive <lb/>dental care should begin early in infancy, during the first year <lb/>of a child&apos;s life to ensure a successful outcome. The main <lb/>concern for dental health is damage to the primary teeth. Early <lb/>childhood caries, rotten teeth in children under 6 years of age, <lb/>is a multi-factorial childhood disease with socio-cultural and <lb/>socio-economic determinants 4 . Dental caries is a dental health <lb/>problem that is quite high in Indonesia with a prevalence of <lb/>more than 80% 5 . <lb/>Data shows that 91.1% of the Indonesian population <lb/>aged 10 years and over have brushed their teeth every day, but <lb/>only 7.3% have brushed their teeth twice at the correct time, <lb/>namely in the morning and night before bed 5 . For elementary <lb/>school-age children, maintaining their oral health still depends <lb/>on their parents, especially their mothers, as the person closest <lb/>to their children. Starting to grow teeth is an important process <lb/>of a child&apos;s growth 6 . Parents, especially mothers, must know <lb/>how to care for their children&apos;s teeth and must also guide their <lb/>children in how to brush their teeth properly and correctly 7 . In <lb/>elementary school-age children, this is the period when teeth <lb/>change from milk teeth to permanent teeth, so a child must <lb/>receive serious attention from his parents. However, many <lb/>parents do not consider dental health problems as a serious <lb/>health problem and do not attach much importance to their <lb/>children&apos;s oral hygiene. Ten out of thirty parents who have <lb/>elementary school-age children still have the wrong perception <lb/>about the incidence of dental caries in their children 8 . <lb/>The role of parents, especially mothers, in <lb/>maintaining healthy teeth is very important in underlying the <lb/>formation of behavior that supports children&apos;s oral hygiene so <lb/>that children&apos;s oral health can be well maintained. Dental caries <lb/></body>

        <body>interferes with a child&apos;s growth and development. Because the <lb/>pain that arises from dental caries affects the child&apos;s appetite, <lb/>thus affecting the intake of nutritious food, and ultimately <lb/>affecting the child&apos;s nutritional status 9 . Apart from that, the pain <lb/>caused by dental caries also really interferes with children&apos;s <lb/>concentration in studying and ultimately affects their academic <lb/>performance 10 . Therefore, the role of parents is very necessary <lb/>for guiding, providing attention, providing understanding, <lb/>reminding, and providing facilities to children so that in the <lb/>future children can maintain the cleanliness of their teeth. Oral <lb/>health education should be introduced to children as early as <lb/>possible so that they can know how to maintain healthy teeth <lb/>and it is hoped that parents will also play a role in supervising <lb/>their children&apos;s dental hygiene by teaching them how to brush <lb/>their teeth properly 11 . <lb/>Children&apos;s oral health is one of the factors supporting <lb/>the success of children&apos;s growth and development. Children&apos;s <lb/>oral health affects their well-being, skills, and competencies and <lb/>influences overall health outcomes 12 . Apart from parental <lb/>concern, school performance, in this case, oral health education <lb/>in schools also has a relationship with children&apos;s good oral <lb/>health 13,14 . So parents need to collaborate with schools in <lb/>increasing their perspective and concern for the health of <lb/>children&apos;s teeth. In this research, factual data will be presented <lb/>regarding the perspectives and concerns of parents, especially <lb/>mothers, regarding children&apos;s oral health which can be used as <lb/>a reference in determining solutions for children&apos;s oral health. <lb/>This study aims to analyze the relationship between maternal <lb/>characteristics and actions to maintain children&apos;s oral health <lb/>with oral hygiene in elementary school-aged children. <lb/>MATERIAL AND METHOD <lb/>This type of research is quantitative analytical with <lb/>a correlation method, analyzing the relationship between a <lb/>maternal characteristic and the perspective of actions to <lb/>maintain children&apos;s oral health with the children&apos;s oral hygiene. <lb/>The population of this study was elementary school students <lb/>attending SD Negeri Seberang Masjid 1 Banjarmasin, South <lb/>Kalimantan, totaling 480 students. The sample was taken using <lb/>a purposive sampling technique, namely grade 5 students and <lb/>their mothers. So the sample size is 85 students and 85 <lb/>mothers. <lb/>Variable characteristics and perspectives of <lb/>mothers&apos; actions in maintaining their children&apos;s oral health <lb/>include: providing teeth brushing facilities, teaching them to <lb/>brush their teeth properly, reminding children to brush their <lb/>teeth in the morning after breakfast, reminding children to <lb/>brush their teeth in the evening before going to bed, and <lb/>reminding children to always rinse your mouth after eating <lb/>sticky sweet foods, and check your teeth regularly every six <lb/>months, measured using a questionnaire consisting of 15 <lb/>question items using the recall method, and each respondent&apos;s <lb/>answer is categorized on a Likert scale, with a score: Always=2, <lb/>Sometimes=1, Never=0. Furthermore, the respondent&apos;s actions <lb/>were categorized using the criteria: Good, if: mean+1SD≥ X ; <lb/>Moderate, if: mean -1SD ≤ X &lt; mean+1SD; Less, if: X&lt;mean-1SD <lb/>Meanwhile, the variable level of children&apos;s oral <lb/>hygiene is measured by selecting six specific index tooth <lb/>surfaces that can adequately represent the front and back <lb/>segments of all tooth surfaces in the oral cavity, then measured <lb/>with the OHI-S Index which is categorized as good, if the OHI-S <lb/>value =0 -0.6; moderate, if OHI-S index = 0.7-1.8; and bad if <lb/>OHI-S index= 1.9 -3.0. Data analysis used an alternative <lb/>relationship test, namely Fisher&apos;s Exact Test because there was <lb/>an expected count value of less than five (50%). <lb/>RESULT <lb/>Seberang Masjid 1 State Elementary School is the <lb/>object of this research. Located on Jl. Kampung Melayu Darat <lb/>No.32, Seberang Masjid, Central Banjarmasin District, <lb/>Banjarmasin City. SD Negeri Seberang Masjid 1 Banjarmasin is <lb/>one of two elementary schools in the city of Banjarmasin <lb/>designated as a school that promotes independent learning 15 . <lb/>Namely, schools that in the teaching and learning process <lb/>mobilize the entire educational ecosystem to realize student-<lb/>centered education. The students of SD Negeri Seberang Masjid <lb/>1 Banjarmasin have received educational intervention from a <lb/>social enterprise startup that focuses on health, especially teeth <lb/>and mouth, in the form of a healthcare platform with <lb/>teledenstry features 15,16 . <lb/>Based on data collection from student respondents <lb/>and their mothers, data on the characteristics of respondents <lb/>was obtained as shown in Table 1. Based on Table 1 regarding <lb/>the characteristics of respondents, it was found that the <lb/>majority of mother respondents were 30-39 years old (72.9%), <lb/>which is of productive age, both physically and economically. <lb/>The majority of mothers (48.2%) have a senior high school <lb/>education which means that the parents&apos; education level is at <lb/>the upper middle level, which is assumed to be quite capable of <lb/>receiving and analyzing health information and then being able <lb/>to apply it in the education and care of children, especially for <lb/>the sake of children&apos;s dental and oral health. The majority of <lb/>mothers (29.4%) are pure housewives, meaning they do not <lb/>have productive economic activities, even though they do it <lb/>from within the home. Most respondents (38.8%) had a family <lb/>income of between 3 -3.9 million rupiah per month. This <lb/>family&apos;s income is sufficient because according to the Central <lb/>Bureau of Statistics, the criteria for a poor family is if the total <lb/>family income is less than IDR 2.3 million per month (in 2023). <lb/>Most mothers (56.5%) stated that they had received <lb/>information about how to maintain the health of their <lb/>children&apos;s teeth and mouth at least once, namely when there <lb/>was dental health education using the Gigi.id application which <lb/>was held at SD Negeri Seberang Masjid 1 Banjarmasin in <lb/>December 2021. The majority of mothers&apos; actions in <lb/>maintaining the cleanliness of their children&apos;s teeth (47.1%) <lb/>were in the sufficient category. Meanwhile, the oral hygiene <lb/>level of students at SDN Seberang Mosque 1, Banjarmasin City, <lb/>who were respondents to this research, was mostly (49.4%) in <lb/>the poor category. <lb/></body>

Meanwhile, for mothers who had been exposed to <lb/>information once, most (48%) of their actions were in the <lb/>sufficient category. For mothers who were exposed to <lb/>information more than once, most of their actions (50%) were <lb/>in the adequate category in maintaining their child&apos;s oral health. <lb/>Furthermore, in the Fisher&apos;s Exact Test analysis, the <lb/>p-value = 0.000 was obtained.

While the mother&apos;s actions are quite good, the <lb/>majority of their children&apos;s oral hygiene levels (67%) are in the <lb/>adequate category. Mothers whose actions to maintain their <lb/>children&apos;s oral health were in the good category, most of their <lb/>children&apos;s oral hygiene levels (50%) were in the good category. <lb/>In the Fisher&apos;s Exact Test correlation analysis, the p-<lb/>value = 0.000 was obtained. This shows that the mother&apos;s <lb/>actions in maintaining the child&apos;s oral health are significantly <lb/>related to the child&apos;s oral hygiene level. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The children&apos;s oral health is a factor that must be considered as <lb/>early as possible because tooth decay at a child&apos;s age can affect <lb/>tooth growth at a later age. <lb/>1. Factors that influence children&apos;s oral hygiene levels <lb/>The practice of oral hygiene by individuals is the most <lb/>important preventive measure recommended, it also means <lb/>that the individual has taken actual preventive measures, this <lb/>oral hygiene practice can be carried out by individuals by <lb/>brushing their teeth 17 . Brushing teeth functions to remove and <lb/>disrupt the formation of plaque and debris, clean food residue <lb/>stuck to the teeth, stimulate gingival tissue, and eliminate <lb/>unwanted bad breath 13 . The behavior of brushing teeth in <lb/>children must be carried out in everyday life without feeling <lb/>forced. The ability to brush your teeth properly and correctly is <lb/>an important factor for oral health care. The success of brushing <lb/>your teeth is also influenced by the use of tools, the method of <lb/>brushing your teeth, as well as the correct frequency and timing <lb/>of brushing your teeth 14,18 . <lb/>From an early age, elementary school students need to be <lb/>educated to maintain healthy teeth. At the age of 10 -12 years, <lb/>children enter the beginning of the permanent dentition phase, <lb/>although the change from primary teeth to permanent teeth is <lb/>still ongoing, many permanent teeth have already emerged. At <lb/>this age, they can grasp an understanding and can explain <lb/>things realistically 8,19 . Apart from that, at the age of 10-12 years <lb/>they can be given responsibility for brushing their teeth. At the <lb/>age of 10-12 years, they can brush their teeth systematically <lb/>compared to the age group below 20 . For this reason, oral health <lb/>needs to be maintained from the start so that children have <lb/>good permanent teeth. <lb/>Most students spend their daily time at home, not at <lb/>school, so parents have an important role in growing and <lb/>developing their children. In this case, parents play a nurturing <lb/>role and provide understanding about the importance of <lb/>getting used to brushing their teeth, providing examples of how <lb/>to brush their teeth correctly, and telling them the right time to <lb/>brush their teeth, parents must prepare the means for brushing <lb/>their teeth 21 . This is to the theory put forward by Green <lb/>regarding behavior change that one of the factors that influence <lb/>a person&apos;s behavior is reinforcing factors, including social <lb/>support, peer influence, and advice and feedback from health <lb/>workers that will strengthen behavior 22 . One of the social <lb/>supports is from parents because of their ignorance or ability <lb/>and some parents have less time to supervise and communicate <lb/>with their children, so children will choose sources of <lb/>information from peers whose truth cannot be guaranteed. <lb/>2. Parental mentoring in students&apos; teeth-brushing actions <lb/>Parents and family are the first social environments <lb/>where a human interacts. Individuals learn not only by how <lb/>they interact with their parents or other family members but <lb/>also by seeing how their parents or family members interact <lb/></body>

        <body>with them or how they interact with each other. Parents and <lb/>other family members provide a model of life skills learned by <lb/>the individual in the early years of life. Parents can play their <lb/>role in improving good habits in brushing their teeth to prevent <lb/>the high prevalence of dental caries in school-aged children 3,23 . <lb/>Parents&apos; role, apart from supervising, is also to teach good <lb/>habits and provide positive reinforcement or feedback when <lb/>children implement good habits in caring for their teeth. Good <lb/>habits in brushing teeth in children can be improved through <lb/>teaching and reinforcing behavior from parents 24 . <lb/>Parents must know how to care for their children&apos;s <lb/>teeth and must care for their children&apos;s teeth and guide their <lb/>children on how to brush their teeth properly. Successful dental <lb/>care for children requires the participation of parents. The role <lb/>of parents is as a figure and as a role model who will provide a <lb/>good example for children in carrying out dental care. The role <lb/>of parents is to guide, remind, and provide facilities so that <lb/>children can maintain the cleanliness of their teeth and <lb/>mouth 25 . Apart from that, parents also play a role in preventing <lb/>plaque and caries in children 3 . In this case, parents play an <lb/>important role in paying attention to children&apos;s discipline <lb/>towards their responsibility in maintaining healthy teeth. <lb/>Preventing a child&apos;s dental caries requires the participation of <lb/>parents and influences the maintenance of dental health and <lb/>hygiene. The participation of parents is needed by school-aged <lb/>children to prevent dental caries in children 10,24 . <lb/>The cause of dental caries in children is a lack of <lb/>supervision from parents when their children brush their teeth. <lb/>Parents must teach personal hygiene actions of brushing their <lb/>teeth before going to bed at night or brushing their teeth after <lb/>waking up 1,8 . Health education carried out by parents by <lb/>teaching, and supervising when children brush their teeth <lb/>shows that parents are considered responsive to children&apos;s <lb/>teeth and mouth. The role of parents can be a motivation for <lb/>children so that it becomes a supporting factor in the success of <lb/>children&apos;s health 26 . In this way, children&apos;s dental and oral health <lb/>is maintained. The important role of parents in maintaining <lb/>children&apos;s dental and oral health is so that child respondents <lb/>are able and able to maintain good dental and oral health 21 . <lb/>Another factor that can influence the success of children&apos;s <lb/>dental health is the use of a toothbrush. So far, children rarely <lb/>pay attention to the toothbrush they use and how to brush their <lb/>teeth correctly. The role of parents is very necessary in <lb/>providing a toothbrush that is appropriate for the child&apos;s age <lb/>and demonstrating how to brush teeth correctly 27 . Brushing <lb/>techniques should be simple, understandable to the child, <lb/>precise and efficient in a timely manner. Brushing your teeth in <lb/>the wrong direction with too much pressure can cause tooth <lb/>wear and gums to recede (gum recession) 28 . Choosing a good <lb/>toothbrush is one that is neither hard nor too soft, because <lb/>toothbrush bristle tips that are too hard will injure the gums, <lb/>making them susceptible to bleeding and abrasion of the tooth <lb/>layer 6 . <lb/>3. The role of mothers in maintaining their children&apos;s oral <lb/>hygiene <lb/>The basic health research 2018 shows that 75.0% of <lb/>the Indonesian population has a history of dental caries with a <lb/>prevalence level of dental severity with a national DMF-T Index <lb/>of 4.6 (or 5 teeth per person) 5 . As many as 23.0% of the <lb/>population were aware of problems with their teeth and mouth, <lb/>and 30.0% of them received treatment or treatment from <lb/>dental health professionals 5 . However, the rate of dental <lb/>treatment is very low and there are many delays in treatment <lb/>and most tooth decay ends extraction. Preventing dental <lb/>disease is very easy, one way is to maintain oral hygiene to <lb/>remove plaque and bacteria by brushing your teeth regularly, <lb/>after breakfast and dinner before bed. <lb/>A mother should have good attitudes, and <lb/>actions regarding dental and oral health to provide oral health <lb/>education to her child 4 . Research by Suryawati, et al (2009) in <lb/>Ciputat and Pasar Minggu Districts, Jakarta showed that 76.8% <lb/>of mothers under five had little knowledge of their children&apos;s <lb/>dental and oral health, 84.1% had a good attitude and 89.0% <lb/>did not take enough action in business. maintaining children&apos;s <lb/>dental health 3,4 . The mother&apos;s knowledge, attitudes and actions <lb/>towards maintaining oral and dental health will determine the <lb/>future dental health status of her child. Starting to grow teeth is <lb/>an important process of a child&apos;s growth. Parents must know <lb/>how to care for their children&apos;s teeth and teach them how to <lb/>care for them properly (29) . Even though they still have milk <lb/>teeth, a child must receive serious attention from their parents <lb/>because they determine the growth of permanent teeth. <lb/>However, many parents think that milk teeth are only <lb/>temporary and will be replaced by permanent teeth, so they <lb/>often think that damage to milk teeth due to poor oral hygiene <lb/>is not a problem 30 . <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>The majority of mothers&apos; actions to maintain their <lb/>children&apos;s oral health (47.1%) are in the sufficient category. <lb/>Meanwhile, the school-age children&apos;s oral hygiene was mostly <lb/>(49.4%) in the poor category. There is a significant relationship <lb/>between maternal characteristics which include: education, <lb/>occupation, family income, and the mother&apos;s actions in <lb/>maintaining her child&apos;s oral hygiene. Meanwhile, the mother&apos;s <lb/>age is not significantly related to the mother&apos;s actions. There is <lb/>a significant relationship between the mother&apos;s actions in <lb/>maintaining her child&apos;s oral health and the school-age <lb/>children&apos;s oral hygiene. <lb/></body>
