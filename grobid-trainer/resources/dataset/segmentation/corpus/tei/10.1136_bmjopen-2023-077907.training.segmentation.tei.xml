Published by <lb/>BMJ. <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Introduction Asthma is the most prevalent obstructive <lb/>pulmonary disease, with drastically improved treatment <lb/>options over the past decades. However, there is still a <lb/>proportion of patients with suboptimal level of asthma <lb/>control, leading to multiple hospitalisation due to severe <lb/>acute exacerbation (SAE) and earlier death. In our study, <lb/>we aimed to assess the risk of SAEs and mortality in <lb/>patients who suffered an SAE. <lb/>Methods The database of the National Health Insurance <lb/>Fund was used to retrospectively analyse the data of <lb/>all asthmatic patients who had been hospitalised for an <lb/>SAE between 2009 and 2019. We used a competing risk <lb/>model to analyse the effect of each exacerbation on the <lb/>risk of further SAEs with age, sex, Charlson index and the <lb/>number of severe and moderate exacerbations included as <lb/>covariates. <lb/>Result Altogether, 9257 asthmatic patients suffered at <lb/>least one exacerbation leading to hospitalisation during <lb/>the study time. The majority (75.8%) were women, and <lb/>the average age was 58.24 years. Most patients had at <lb/>least one comorbidity. 3492 patients suffered at least one <lb/>further exacerbation and 1193 patients died of any cause. <lb/>In the competing risk model, each SAE increased the risk <lb/>of further exacerbations (HR=2.078-7.026; p&lt;0.0001 <lb/>for each case) but not death. The risk of SAEs was also <lb/>increased by age (HR=1.008) female sex (HR=1.102) and <lb/>with the number of days of the first SAE (HR=1.007). <lb/>Conclusions Even though asthma is generally a well-<lb/>manageable disease, there still are many patients who <lb/>suffer SAEs that significantly increase the risk of further <lb/>similar SAEs. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Asthma is among the most common non-<lb/>communicable diseases, affecting more than <lb/>250 million patients worldwide, including <lb/>approximately 300 000 registered cases in <lb/>Hungary. 1 The diagnosis and treatment of <lb/>asthma has significantly improved over the <lb/>past decades, resulting in a marked decrease <lb/>in mortality. Currently, asthma is consid-<lb/>ered a manageable disease; however, there <lb/>is a sizeable proportion of patients whose <lb/>asthma control is difficult to achieve. About <lb/>17% of all asthma cases fall in the category <lb/>of difficult-to-treat asthma, with 3.7% of them <lb/>considered as severe, according to the Global <lb/>Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. 2 The <lb/>main difference between the aforementioned <lb/>groups is the optimisation of treatment-to <lb/>consider someone a severe asthmatic patient, <lb/>their adherence, inhaler training and other <lb/>contributing factors have to be managed <lb/>properly. Even though severe patients make <lb/>up less than 5% of all asthmatics, their care <lb/>is estimated to account for more than 60% of <lb/>all costs associated with asthma care. 3 Uncon-<lb/>trolled asthma is much more common in the <lb/>difficult-to-treat and severe asthma popu-<lb/>lations, and this results in a higher risk for <lb/>exacerbations and mortality in these patient <lb/>groups 3-6 ; however, up to 30% of asthma <lb/></body>

        <front>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC <lb/>⇒ There is ample knowledge on the natural course of <lb/>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerba-<lb/>tions and their effect on mortality; however, there <lb/>is scarcity of data on risk factors of exacerbations <lb/>and mortality of asthmatic patients, especially in <lb/>Central-Eastern-Europe. <lb/>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS <lb/>⇒ With the inclusion of more than 9000 patients, we <lb/>assessed the effect of asthma exacerbations on <lb/>subsequent hospitalisation due to flare-ups and <lb/>mortality. We found that in asthma each exacerba-<lb/>tion significantly increased the risk of further exac-<lb/>erbations but not mortality. <lb/>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, <lb/>PRACTICE OR POLICY <lb/>⇒ Our study highlights the importance of the preven-<lb/>tion of asthma exacerbations and the fact that de-<lb/>spite the advancements in asthma treatment over <lb/>the past decades, there is still need for further im-<lb/>provements in asthma management. <lb/></front>

        <body>exacerbations and deaths affect patients with mild, infre-<lb/>quent symptoms. 7 Exacerbations and mortality, as worst <lb/>asthma outcomes, have been associated with several risk <lb/>factors. Most available studies list gender, older age, the <lb/>number and severity of comorbidities, severity of asthma <lb/>and earlier exacerbations as the main risk factors for <lb/>death. 8-10 According to the latest results the risk of severe <lb/>acute exacerbation (SAEs) and mortality also increases <lb/>incrementally with higher short-acting beta agonist <lb/>(SABA) use, and with multiple important biomarkers, <lb/>such as fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosino-<lb/>phils. 2 11 At the same time, recent data on prevalence of <lb/>frequent exacerbating phenotype and mortality rates in <lb/>asthma is scarce. <lb/>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and <lb/>asthma share multiple similarities, resulting in the diffi-<lb/>culty of differential diagnosis. 12 The main risk factors for <lb/>mortality also seem to be similar in the two diseases. In <lb/>our earlier publication, whose methodology was based <lb/>on the well-known study by Suissa et al, 13 we assessed the <lb/>effect of severe COPD exacerbations on future exacerba-<lb/>tion and mortality risk and found that despite the ther-<lb/>apeutic advances in the past decade, the natural course <lb/>of the disease remained the same. 14 However, no studies <lb/>assessed the same questions in general asthmatic popu-<lb/>lation-in the current database analysis, we present the <lb/>results of the same investigational model in asthma. 14 <lb/>Finally, as many comorbid conditions are among the <lb/>main risk factors for uncontrolled asthma, we also exam-<lb/>ined the prevalence and co-occurrence of comorbidities <lb/>in this patient population. 8 15 <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Data source <lb/>A longitudinal, retrospective analysis using the National <lb/>Health Insurance Fund&apos;s (NHIF) database (DB) was <lb/>performed. This is a complex database that encom-<lb/>passes the entire population of Hungary, collecting <lb/>certain healthcare data, including all reimbursement <lb/>drug prescriptions, inpatient and outpatient visits, labo-<lb/>ratory and imaging examinations, and the 10th edition <lb/>of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes <lb/>for all these events. Further details on the DB had been <lb/>reported in our previous publication. 14 The analysis was <lb/>performed under the same regulatory approval. Patients <lb/>or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, <lb/>or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. <lb/>Patients <lb/>First, all patients who received at least one inhalation drug <lb/>(inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta agonist <lb/>(LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or <lb/>any fixed combination of these or SABA or short-acting <lb/>muscarinic antagonist (SAMA)) with the ICD-10 code of <lb/>asthma (J45), between 1 January 2010 and 31 December <lb/>2019. A total of 906 461 patients were identified. After <lb/>the first respiratory medication, at least one SAE was <lb/>required for enrolment. A severe asthma exacerbation <lb/>was defined as a hospital admission (inpatient hospital <lb/>or ambulatory emergency care) with the ICD-10 code of <lb/>asthma as the primary discharge diagnosis. This event was <lb/>referred to as the index hospitalisation for exacerbation <lb/>Figure 1 Flow chart of cohort formation.

        <body>event in the following sections (20 089 patients-100%). <lb/>The baseline period was defined as 1 year before the <lb/>index hospitalisation event.

        <body>Data analysis <lb/>Descriptive parameters such as gender, age (calculated at <lb/>the first event of exacerbation) and length and type (acute <lb/>inpatient care/rehabilitation) of the first hospitalisation <lb/>were collected on the index date. One year before the <lb/>first SAE, a baseline period was applied, which was used <lb/>to collect information on comorbidities and dispensed <lb/>treatments. Data on comorbidities were collected to form <lb/>the Charlson index based on the ICD-10 codes definition <lb/>by Sundararajan et al. 16 We also collected data on several <lb/>psychological disorders to explore their prevalence <lb/>in the asthmatic population. Collective cardiovascular <lb/>disease (CVD) umbrella term was formed, encompassing <lb/>ischaemic heart disease, heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, <lb/>previous myocardial infarcts and cardiogenic shock. The <lb/>prevalence and co-occurrence of comorbid conditions <lb/>at baseline were analysed based on the reported ICD-10 <lb/>codes of prescriptions, inpatient and outpatient events. <lb/>Finally, moderate exacerbation was also investigated. It <lb/>was defined as prescription dispensation for oral corti-<lb/>costeroids with the ICD-10 of asthma. If a moderate event <lb/>was followed by a severe event within 7 days, both events <lb/>were considered as a single SAE. <lb/>The main outcomes of the study were subsequent exac-<lb/>erbations and death of any cause. The start of follow-up <lb/>was defined as the date of live discharge from hospital. <lb/>The overall hazard function of successive severe asthma <lb/>exacerbations was estimated using two approaches. In the <lb/>first approach a competing risk model was used, where <lb/>the event was defined as the next severe asthma exacer-<lb/>bation or death, whichever occurred first, while in the <lb/>second approach Kaplan-Meier method was used, where <lb/>beside the lost to follow-up the occurrence of death was <lb/>also censor event. 13 For graphically representation of the <lb/>hazard function of successive SAE over time, the hazard <lb/>functions of each successive SAE were combined with the <lb/>median interexacerbation time. Competing risk model <lb/>was also used to estimate the relative risk of each succes-<lb/>sive SAE on the subsequent one and on mortality. The <lb/>number of previous severe and moderate exacerbations <lb/>was included in the model as a time-dependent covariate, <lb/>maximised at a value of 9, with sex, age, duration of the <lb/>Figure 2 Most common single and co-occurring comorbidities in the study population.

The values of the Charlson <lb/>index were classified in the model as mild (values of 1-2), <lb/>moderate (3-4) or severe (5). 17 Finally, as a sensitivity <lb/>analyses the effect of subsequent SAEs on mortality was <lb/>also analysed using a simple Cox proportional hazards <lb/>model. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Descriptive results <lb/>After the application of all exclusion criteria, a final <lb/>cohort of 9257 patients was formed. Their average age <lb/>was 58.24 years. 75.8% of all patients were women. All <lb/>patients were prescribed at least one inhaled medica-<lb/>tion prior to their first SAE including agents such as ICS, <lb/>β agonists and muscarinic antagonists. Most patients <lb/>(88.1%) received ICS-containing treatment, with 74.3% <lb/>of them receiving a LABA treatment as well 1 year prior <lb/>to their index hospitalisation. 11.9% of patients did not <lb/>receive any ICS-containing medications, and 9.9% used <lb/>only SABA treatment in the baseline period. 68.8% of all <lb/>patients were prescribed at least one SABA medication, <lb/>while 30.6% of them used at least three canisters of SABA <lb/>as reliever therapy. The average Charlson index score was <lb/>2.25 with CVDs (42.7%), anxiety (25.7%), depression <lb/>(19.3%) and cerebrovascular diseases (18.2%) being the <lb/>most common comorbidities. Details on all descriptive <lb/>statistics are shown in table 1. <lb/>Data on prevalence and co-occurrence of comorbidities <lb/>are shown in figure 2. The majority of patients suffered <lb/>from at least one comorbidity. As seen on the figure, the <lb/>most common comorbidities were CVDs, anxiety, depres-<lb/>sion and diabetes, while the most common co-occurring <lb/>comorbidities were CVD and anxiety, CVD and HF and <lb/>anxiety depression. <lb/>A total of 3492 patients (37.7%) experienced at least <lb/>one subsequent SAE and 1193 patients (12.9%) died <lb/>during follow-up. There were important differences in <lb/>Figure 3 Hazard function of all subsequent SAEs (per 10 000 per day) from the time of the first SAE over the follow-up <lb/>period, with the time between successive exacerbations estimated using: (A) the median interexacerbation times as time to <lb/>the next exacerbation or death, whichever occurs first and (B); the median interexacerbation times to the next exacerbation, <lb/>conditional on survival with death as a censor event.

        <body>baseline parameters among the overall population and <lb/>those who suffered at least one subsequent SAE and <lb/>those who died during the follow-up period. The latter <lb/>were the oldest (average age of 70.95 years) but with the <lb/>smallest proportion of female patients, but still greater <lb/>than that of men. Their average Charlson index score <lb/>was 3.13, with most diseases being much more prevalent, <lb/>except for anxiety (25.8%) and depression (17.1%), <lb/>which showed a similar prevalence. The proportion of <lb/>each prescribed inhaled respiratory medication was <lb/>similar in all groups, although among those who died, the <lb/>percentage of SABA overusers (prescribed ≥3 canisters <lb/>annually) was higher compared with the others (table 1). <lb/>All included patients had dispensed at least one reliever <lb/>or maintenance therapy in the baseline period. <lb/>During the index hospitalisation, 16% of our patients <lb/>were treated for a single day (most likely at an emergency <lb/>ward), while the second most frequent time of hospital-<lb/>isation was 4 days (12% of all patients were treated for <lb/>4 days exactly). <lb/>Figure 3A displays the hazard function of the time <lb/>between SAEs and the next SAE or death, whichever <lb/>occurred first. The average time between exacerba-<lb/>tions decreased markedly between later exacerbations. <lb/>Figure 3B shows a similar pattern regarding the time to <lb/>the next SAE after the first severe asthma exacerbation <lb/>leading to hospitalisation, however, the median time to <lb/>first event was much longer. <lb/>Model results <lb/>In the competing risk model for next exacerbation, a <lb/>relevant and statistically significant increase was seen in <lb/>the risk for next SAE event, after each SAE (HR 2.078, <lb/>95% CI 1.969 to 2.193 after the second SAE and HR 7.026 <lb/>95% CI 5.980 to 8.256 after the ninth SAE).

        <body>Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR 2.087, 95% CI 1.772 <lb/>to 2.457 for severe Charlson scores) and older age (HR <lb/>1.092 95% CI 1.085 to 1.098) caused significant increase <lb/>in risk of mortality. Length of index hospitalisation also <lb/>had a minor increasing effect on mortality (HR 1.005, <lb/>95% CI 1.004 to 1.006). Female patients had a signifi-<lb/>cantly lower risk for death than their male counterparts <lb/>(HR 0.560 95% CI 0.495 to 0.633). <lb/>Moderate exacerbations did not have a consistent <lb/>significant effect on either outcomes. HR values and CIs <lb/>can be seen in figure 4. <lb/>There was a possibility that within the competing risk <lb/>model, a higher risk for exacerbations might diminish <lb/>the increased risk for mortality after multiple SAEs, so we <lb/>created a separate Cox regression model where the event <lb/>was death without competing risk for next SAE. <lb/>In the Cox regression model for mortality, after the <lb/>second SAE (HR 1.222; 95% CI 1.041 to 1.435), we did <lb/>not see a significant effect of subsequent SAEs on the risk <lb/>of death. Similarly, to the competing risk model older <lb/>age, male gender, longer index hospitalisation and more <lb/>severe Charlson score were risk factors for death. All HR <lb/>values and CIs are shown in figure 5. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In our retrospective financial database analysis, we could <lb/>prove that SAEs significantly increase the risk for future <lb/>SAEs in asthma patients. These results, based on the long-<lb/>term follow-up of more than 9000 asthma patients, are in <lb/>line with our previous work assessing the same endpoints <lb/>in COPD, during the same time frame. 14 Similarly, to <lb/>that study, the risk for subsequent SAEs increased mark-<lb/>edly after each SAE event, resulting in an HR of &gt;7 after <lb/>the ninth event. However, the risk for mortality did not <lb/>increase with the number of SAEs in the competing risk <lb/>model and only increased after the second SAE in the <lb/>Cox regression model. This result might be due to the <lb/>low number of deaths and the relatively short time of <lb/>follow-up. <lb/>Interestingly, there were some differences in the <lb/>results of this asthma population and the patients with <lb/>COPD reported in our earlier publication. 14 While in <lb/>both studies and both populations, a risk for next SAE <lb/>increased significantly after each successive SAE, the <lb/>increase in risk differed after certain events. In our <lb/>previous study in patients with COPD, the risk for next <lb/>event showed a steady increase after each SAE, while in <lb/>current study in asthmatics, the risk peaked after the <lb/>second and third events. At the same time, the median <lb/>time to next event was much longer after the first SAE <lb/>in asthma patients than with COPD, but with the events <lb/>stacking up, median times decreased as well. These data <lb/>might suggest that the first few SAEs focus the clinicians&apos; <lb/>attention to asthmatics much more than to patients with <lb/>COPD that might result in higher level of care and thus <lb/>longer median time between events. Also in contrast <lb/>to patients with COPD, in the case of frequent exacer-<lb/>bator asthmatic patients, the changes in treatment (dose <lb/>increase of corticosteroids and in a certain patient popu-<lb/>lations, usage of biological therapies) could have a higher <lb/>effect on disease management. Patients with asthma may <lb/>also have higher medication adherence after the first <lb/>Figure 5 Model-estimated HRs and respective 95% CIs for risk of death. <lb/></body>

        <body>SAE than those of COPD thus achieving higher disease <lb/>control. Interestingly moderate exacerbations did not <lb/>have any significant effect on SAE and mortality risk in <lb/>asthma. <lb/>It is also important to stress the effect of hospitalisa-<lb/>tion length of the first SAE. Both in the exacerbation and <lb/>death models longer hospital stays resulted in a higher <lb/>risk for both outcomes. Even though the numerical effect <lb/>was little, it was conveyed by even a single day of further <lb/>hospital stay. This result highlights the importance of <lb/>optimal patient management to minimise the need for <lb/>hospital admission duration. In this research, we did <lb/>not assess the effect of the length of further hospitalisa-<lb/>tions due to SAEs but uncovering the possible additional <lb/>risks of the days spent in hospitals, further analysis is <lb/>warranted. <lb/>Uncontrolled comorbidities can worsen asthma <lb/>control, decrease therapeutic effect of and adherence to <lb/>asthma treatment and can also mimic asthma symptoms <lb/>resulting in needless treatment escalation. 15 18 In our <lb/>study, the prevalence of most measured comorbidities <lb/>was higher than reported in the work of Tomisa et al from <lb/>Hungary 8 and was about the upper limit of prevalence <lb/>reported in international studies. 15 19 20 This might be <lb/>among the causes for worse disease control and higher <lb/>risk for exacerbations than the general asthma popula-<lb/>tion. The most common co-occurring comorbidities were <lb/>CVDs and their complications, with psychiatric disor-<lb/>ders being present at the same time. The occurrence <lb/>of psychiatric disorders was frequent, even the preva-<lb/>lence of schizophrenia far exceeded that of the general <lb/>population. 21 <lb/>The overuse of short-acting bronchodilators is an <lb/>important risk factor for exacerbations and death. <lb/>Overuse is defined as the use of 3 or more canisters of <lb/>reliever therapy in 12 months. 2 In our study, among the <lb/>patients who died, the prevalence of SABA overusers was <lb/>much higher than in the general study population. The <lb/>risk associated with high SABA use had recently been <lb/>investigated in the SABINA nationwide cohort study, <lb/>which found that even 3-5 dispensation of SABA canis-<lb/>ters a year was associated with a significant increase in <lb/>mortality risk. 22 It is paramount to check medication <lb/>usage and to reassess patients&apos; treatments and inhalation <lb/>technique if their control is not achieved despite proper <lb/>adherence. Increasing the ICS dose or adding additional <lb/>medications (tiotropium or leukotriene receptor antago-<lb/>nist) might be necessary to decrease the need for rescue <lb/>medications. <lb/>The main strength of our study is the possibility for <lb/>long-term follow-up of a huge number of patients. <lb/>Furthermore, due to a single health insurance fund in <lb/>our country, presumably nearly all treated asthmatic <lb/>patients could be identified. With the use of the NHIF&apos;s <lb/>DB it is possible to include a much larger number of <lb/>patients than what would be feasible in clinical settings. <lb/>Also, as a financial database, the collected data are very <lb/>accurate making the overall analysis very reliable. Finally, <lb/>through this database the examination of comorbidities <lb/>is much easier and more accurate than what could be <lb/>achieved in clinical setting. <lb/>The key limitation of our study is the missing clinical <lb/>parameters from the financial database. Also, we have <lb/>no way of acquiring spirometry results, so the selection <lb/>of patients has to be based solely on their prescription <lb/>history. To ensure the exclusion of patients with COPD, <lb/>we had to apply very strict criteria which might have also <lb/>excluded some asthmatic patients. Another limitation of <lb/>our study stems from its retrospective nature. Also it is <lb/>not appropriate to equate prescription of a drug with the <lb/>actual use; hence, it is not possible to attribute any of our <lb/>results as therapeutic effect. Finally, the NHIF database <lb/>does not include the cause of death for patients who did <lb/>not die in a hospital, so we could not determine the exact <lb/>cause for all patients. <lb/>To summarise, we have performed a long-term retro-<lb/>spective study to assess future exacerbation and mortality <lb/>risk in more than 9000 asthma patients, who had been <lb/>hospitalised due to an asthma exacerbation. Our results <lb/>suggest that each SAE event significantly increases the <lb/>risk for further asthma exacerbation, showing a similar <lb/>pattern to that of patients with COPD. Even though <lb/>asthma is generally a well-manageable disease a smaller <lb/>proportion of patients still suffer from very serious symp-<lb/>toms, resulting in multiple hospitalisations, probably <lb/>leading to earlier death. <lb/></body>
