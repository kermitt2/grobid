The potential energy of the Higgs field is transferred <lb/>to particles. Hence they acquire mass. These ideas were essential in fulfilling the basic <lb/>need for a particle, called Higgs, with mass. These particles are called Higgs particles <lb/>with spin zero with its mass to be ∼ 125 GeV. This raises the question as to its physical <lb/>effects. If these particles are present, will they exhibit a Casimir effect and also obey the <lb/>Stefan-Boltzmann Law? Assuming the dynamics of this field, will these effects change <lb/>with temperature. The present calculation uses thermo field dynamics formalism to <lb/>calculate temperature effects. <lb/>Keywords: Casimir effect; Higgs field; finite temperature. <lb/>PACS numbers: 03.65.−w, 11.10.Wx <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>The Standard Model provides a framework for our present understanding of forces of <lb/>nature and fundamental particles. This model describes three types of forces: weak, <lb/>electromagnetic and strong nuclear. In 1970s, weak and electromagnetic interactions <lb/>were unified as the electroweak force. The weak force describes interaction of elec-<lb/>trons, neutrinos, quarks and other particles with exchange of W and Z particles. <lb/></body>

			<body>Electromagnetism describes interaction of charged particles with exchange of pho-<lb/>tons. The photon is massless while W and Z have mass, nearly 100 times that of a <lb/>proton. To solve this problem the Higgs mechanism was proposed. 1-6 This mecha-<lb/>nism gives a mass to the W and Z particles when they interact with the Higgs field. <lb/>The potential energy of the Higgs field is transferred to particles that leads to the <lb/>Higgs boson that is uncharged, even parity and zero spin, which has been observed <lb/>at LHC. 7,8 There are speculations that a charged Higgs particle may exist. However, <lb/>this has not been established yet. Will Higgs particles with spin zero and no charge <lb/>display properties similar to those of other fundamental particles? It is well known <lb/>that the Casimir effect is a phenomenon observed for the electromagnetic field. Is <lb/>there a Casimir effect due to the presence of the Higgs field? Since it has a quantum <lb/>nature, it is expected to show Casimir force and the Stefan-Boltzmann effect. <lb/>The Casimir effect 9 has been measured when two parallel conducting plates <lb/>are attracted due to vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The first <lb/>experimental to observe the Casimir effect was made by Sparnaay. 10 Now this effect <lb/>has been established to a high degree of accuracy for the electromagnetic field. 11,12 <lb/>There are some practical applications, such as, micro-and nanotechnologies 13,14 <lb/>and superconductors at high temperature. 15,16 Finite temperature corrections to <lb/>the Casimir effect involving the electromagnetic field have been calculated. 17 Our <lb/>objective in this paper is to calculate the Casimir effect for the Higgs particles. <lb/>Studies at zero temperature on this issue has been carried out. 18 However, what is <lb/>the effect of temperature for the Higgs particles? The thermo field dynamics (TFD) <lb/>formalism is used to find the finite temperature effect on both the Casimir effect as <lb/>well as on the Stefan-Boltzmann effect. <lb/>TFD 19-24 is a thermal quantum field theory. In this formalism, the statistical <lb/>average of an arbitrary operator is interpreted as an expectation value in a thermal <lb/>vacuum, i.e. A = 0(β)|A|0(β). The thermal vacuum, defined by |0(β), describes <lb/>a system in thermal equilibrium, where β = 1 <lb/>kB T , with T is the temperature and <lb/>k B is the Boltzmann constant (we use k B = 1). This formalism is composed of two <lb/>elements: (i) doubling, tilde and nontilde components, of the original Hilbert space <lb/>and (ii) using the Bogoliubov transformation of the Hilbert space. Bogoliubov trans-<lb/>formation introduces a rotation in the tilde and nontilde operators. The physical <lb/>quantities are described by nontilde operators. <lb/>This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, a brief introduction to the TFD <lb/>formalism is presented. In Sec. 3, the Higgs field Lagrangian is given. The energy-<lb/>momentum tensor is calculated. In Sec. 4, some applications are developed. The <lb/>Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Casimir effect for the Higgs field at zero and finite <lb/>temperature are calculated. In Sec. 5, some concluding remarks are presented. <lb/>2. TFD Formalism <lb/>Here, a brief introduction to the TFD formalism 19-24 is presented. In this formalism, <lb/>the Hilbert space S is doubled, S T = S ⊗ ˜ <lb/>S, where˜Swhere˜ where˜S is the dual Hilbert space. <lb/>

			The map between the tilde˜Atilde˜ tilde˜A i and nontilde A i operators is defined by the following <lb/>tilde (or dual) conjugation rules: <lb/>(A i A j ) ∼ = ˜ <lb/>A i ˜ <lb/>A j , <lb/>(cA i + A j ) ∼ = c * ˜ <lb/>A i + ˜ <lb/>A j , <lb/>(A † <lb/>i ) ∼ = ˜ <lb/>A i <lb/> † , <lb/>( ˜ <lb/>A i ) ∼ = −ξA i , <lb/>(1) <lb/>with ξ = −1 for bosons and ξ = +1 for fermions. For an arbitrary operator A, the <lb/>standard doublet notation is <lb/>A a = <lb/>A 1 <lb/>A 2 <lb/>= <lb/>A <lb/>˜ <lb/>A † <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where a has the values 1 and 2. The tilde operators are auxiliary degrees of freedom <lb/>which allow accommodation of the thermal properties of the system. Thermal effects <lb/>are introduced using the Bogoliubov transformation. For an arbitrary operator and <lb/>using the doublet notation, we get <lb/>A(α, k) <lb/>˜ <lb/>A † (α, k) <lb/>= U(α) <lb/>A(k) <lb/>˜ <lb/>A † (k) <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where <lb/>U(α) = <lb/>u(α) −v(α) <lb/>ξv(α) u(α) <lb/>(4) <lb/>is the Bogoliubov transformation with u 2 (α) + ξv 2 (α) = 1. As an example, con-<lb/>sider d(α) = A(α), where d(α) are the bosons operators. Then the Bogoliubov <lb/>transformations becomes <lb/>d(α) = u(α)d(k) − v(α) ˜ <lb/>d † (k) , <lb/>(5) <lb/>˜ <lb/>d † (α) = u(α) ˜ <lb/>d † (k) − v(α)d(k) , <lb/>(6) <lb/>where <lb/>d † , ˜ <lb/>d † <lb/>are creation operators, (d, ˜ <lb/>d) are destruction operators, and the alge-<lb/>braic rules for thermal operators are <lb/>d(k, α), d † (p, α) <lb/>= δ 3 (k − p) , <lb/>˜ <lb/>d(k, α), ˜ <lb/>d † (p, α) <lb/>= δ 3 (k − p) , <lb/>(7) <lb/>and other commutation relations are null. The quantities u(α) and v(α) are related <lb/>to the Bose distribution and are given as <lb/>v 2 (α) = <lb/>1 <lb/>e αω − 1 <lb/>, u 2 (α) = 1 + v 2 (α) . <lb/>(8) <lb/>We have ω = ω(k) and α = β. <lb/>

			Here, a field theory on the topology Γ p <lb/>D = (S 1 ) p × R D−p with 1 ≤ p ≤ D, is <lb/>considered. D are the space-time dimensions and p is the number of compactified <lb/>dimensions. This establishes a formalism in such way that any set of dimensions <lb/>of the manifold R D can be compactified, where the circumference of the nth S 1 is <lb/>specified by α n . Then, the α parameter is assumed as the compactification param-<lb/>eter defined by α = (α 0 , α 1 , . . . , α D−1 ). The effect of temperature is described by <lb/>the choice α 0 ≡ β and α 1 , . . . , α D−1 = 0, where β = 1/k B T with k B being the <lb/>Boltzmann constant. <lb/>Using the TFD formalism, any propagator is written in terms of the α-<lb/>parameter. For the scalar field, the propagator is <lb/>G <lb/>(ab) <lb/>0 <lb/>(x − x ′ ; α) = i0, ˜ 0|τ [φ a (x; α)φ b (x ′ ; α)]|0, ˜ 0 , <lb/>(9) <lb/>where a, b = 1, 2, τ is the time ordering operator and φ(x; α) = U(α)φ(x)U −1 (α). <lb/>In the thermal vacuum |0(α) = U(α)|0, ˜ 0, the propagator is <lb/>G <lb/>(ab) <lb/>0 <lb/>(x − x ′ ; α) = i <lb/>d 4 k <lb/>(2π) 4 e −ik(x−x ′ ) G <lb/>(ab) <lb/>0 <lb/>(k; α) . <lb/>(10) <lb/>Then the physical Green function, nontilde part, (there is similar function for the <lb/>tilde part) is <lb/>G <lb/>(11) <lb/>0 <lb/>(k; α) = G 0 (k) + v 2 (k; α)[G * <lb/>0 (k) − G 0 (k)] , <lb/>(11) <lb/>where v 2 (k; α) is the generalized Bogoliubov transformation 25 which is given as <lb/>v 2 (k; α) = <lb/>p <lb/>s=1 <lb/>{σs} <lb/>2 s−1 <lb/>∞ <lb/>lσ 1 ,...,lσ s =1 <lb/>(−η) s+ <lb/>s <lb/>r=1 lσ r exp <lb/>− <lb/>s <lb/>j=1 <lb/>α σj l σj k σj <lb/>, <lb/>(12) <lb/>with p being the number of compactified dimensions, η = 1(−1) for fermions <lb/>(bosons), {σ s } denotes the set of all combinations with s elements and k is the <lb/>4-momentum. <lb/>3. The Model <lb/>The Lagrangian for the Higgs field in the thermal representation is <lb/>ˆ <lb/>L = L − ˜ <lb/>L = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(∂ µ φ) † (∂ µ φ) + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>m 2 φ † φ − <lb/>λ <lb/>2 <lb/>(φ † φ) 2 <lb/>− <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(∂ µ ˜ <lb/>φ) † (∂ µ ˜ <lb/>φ) − <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>m 2 ˜ <lb/>φ † ˜ <lb/>φ + <lb/>λ <lb/>2 <lb/>( ˜ <lb/>φ † ˜ <lb/>φ) 2 , <lb/>(13) <lb/>where λ is a positive constant.

			and the Casimir pressure is <lb/>T 33(11) (β, d) = − <lb/>2 <lb/>π 2 <lb/>∞ <lb/>l0,l3=1 <lb/>3(2dl 3 ) 2 − (βl 0 ) 2 <lb/>[(βl 0 ) 2 + (2dl 3 ) 2 ] 3 . <lb/>(43) <lb/>5. Conclusions <lb/>The Higgs field is present everywhere in the universe. The interaction of this funda-<lb/>mental field with any particle results in the appearance of mass through the Higgs <lb/>mechanism and the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Although Higgs boson has <lb/>been observed experimentally, there remains several other questions with regards <lb/>to the presence of charged Higgs bosons. This brings to the possibility to observe <lb/>the Casimir effect. The Higgs field is present since the beginning of the universe, this <lb/>must have other implications for particle physics and how the finite temperature <lb/>effects may modify the Casimir effect? The Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Casimir <lb/>effect for the Higgs field at zero and finite temperature are calculated. Experiments <lb/>are likely to confirm some of these results. <lb/></body>
