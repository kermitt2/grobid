The single-cell model showed that the high <lb/>cell-to-cell variability in nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 is caused by variability in the amount <lb/>of EpoR:JAK2 complexes and of SHP1 as well as the extent of nuclear import due to the large <lb/>variance in the cytoplasmic volume of CFU-E cells. 24 to 118 pSTAT5 molecules in the <lb/>nucleus for 120 min are sufficient to ensure cell survival. Thus, variability in membrane-<lb/>associated processes are responsible to convert a switch-like behavior at the single-cell level <lb/>to a graded population level response. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>single-cell modeling * JAK/STAT * signal transduction * Epo <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Signal transduction has been intensively studied in the last decades at the cell population <lb/>level utilizing immunoblotting and bulk gene-expression analyses. However, information <lb/>processing is highly dynamic and occurs at the single-cell level with considerable cell-to-cell <lb/>variability (Taniguchi et al, 2010). This variability can be beneficial in some contexts and <lb/>harmful in others (Raj &amp; van Oudenaarden, 2008). For example, cell-to-cell variability can <lb/>improve robustness of signal transduction responses (Paszek et al, 2010) but also lead to <lb/>incomplete growth inhibition of tumor cells (Niepel et al, 2009). It has been reported that while <lb/>cell-to-cell variability is fundamental to most molecular processes in cells, quantitative <lb/>assessment of how this influences information processing through intracellular signal <lb/>transduction networks is almost completely lacking (Pelkmans, 2012). Furthermore, several <lb/>cellular responses such as apoptosis, cell cycle entry or epithelial to mesenchymal transition <lb/>are binary cell fate decisions in single cells, but typically appear to occur as a graded response <lb/>at the population level due to cell-to-cell variability. <lb/>For the adequate production of mature erythrocytes, which is essential to maintaining <lb/>constant plasma concentrations of hemoglobin, the survival of erythroid progenitor cells at <lb/>the colony forming erythroid stage (CFU-E) has to be tightly controlled (Nijhof &amp; Wierenga, <lb/>1983). A homogenous switch-like induction of survival in all CFU-E cells by the hormone <lb/>erythropoietin (Epo), a key regulator of erythropoiesis (Richmond et al, 2005), would lead to <lb/>detrimental fluctuations in hemoglobin levels. Therefore, a graded input-output relationship <lb/>of survival of CFU-E cells as a function of Epo concentrations is beneficial (Koulnis et al, 2014). <lb/>Yet, since in individual CFU-E cells Epo-induced signal transduction that promotes cell <lb/>survival triggers a binary decision, to achieve a graded output at the population level, <lb/>heterogeneity in the sensitivity of CFU-E cells to Epo is required. <lb/>In CFU-E cells, the JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway is a key mediator of cell survival <lb/>(Socolovsky et al, 2001). It facilitates rapid signal transduction and connects binding of Epo <lb/>to its cell surface receptor, the EpoR, with gene expression in the nucleus (Swameye et al, <lb/>2003) and cell survival (Bachmann et al, 2011). The Epo-EpoR complex activates the receptor-<lb/>associated Janus kinase JAK2, which phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of the EpoR on <lb/>multiple tyrosine residues (Klingmüller et al, 1996). STAT5 is recruited to the phosphorylated <lb/>receptor complex and is in turn phosphorylated by JAK2 (Gouilleux et al, 1995). <lb/>Phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) molecules form dimers (Boehm et al, 2014), translocate to <lb/>the nucleus and induce the expression of anti-apoptotic target genes, e.g. Bcl2l1 for <lb/>immediate control of cell survival (Socolovsky et al, 1999). Other STAT5 target genes include <lb/>Cish (Yoshimura et al, 1995) and Socs3 (Sasaki et al, 2000) that encode the negative feedback <lb/></body>

			<body>regulators cytokine-inducible SH2 domain containing protein (CIS) and suppressor of <lb/>cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which attenuate signal transduction. The SH2 domain-<lb/>containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) is a cytosolic protein that is recruited to the <lb/>activated receptor via its SH2 domain (Neel et al, 2003). Receptor recruitment activates the <lb/>phosphatase activity of SHP1 and thereby causes dephosphorylation of JAK2 leading to <lb/>termination of signal transduction (Klingmüller et al, 1996). Since the activation of the core <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction cascade is controlled by multiple transcription-induced <lb/>feedbacks and an induced activity feedback, the reaction network coupling Epo to survival of <lb/>CFU-E cells are non-linear. This renders the outcome difficult to predict. <lb/>Dynamic pathway models provide suitable tools to identify systems properties in such non-<lb/>linear reaction networks. Previously, we established a dynamic pathway model of the Epo-<lb/>induced JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway in CFU-E cells and calibrated the model <lb/>parameters using population-average data (Bachmann et al, 2011). This population average <lb/>model of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway enabled us to discern that the activation of the pathway <lb/>is terminated by two dose-dependent transcriptional feedback regulators, SOCS3 and CIS, <lb/>which show maximal expression after approximately 60 min of Epo stimulation and operate <lb/>as noise filters in the pathway. Further, the model showed that the integral of pSTAT5 in the <lb/>nucleus observed within 60 min of Epo stimulation correlates with the extent of survival of <lb/>CFU-E cells (Bachmann et al, 2011). However, this mathematical model only described the <lb/>average activation of the pathway in a population of CFU-E cells without taking cell-to-cell <lb/>variability into account. Therefore, it remained elusive how the gradual Epo-induced increase <lb/>in STAT5 phosphorylation and survival of CFU-E cells at the cell population level relates to <lb/>the switch-like all-or-none survival decision that occurred in an individual cell. <lb/>The elucidation of mechanisms that lead to cell-to-cell variability in responses requires <lb/>mechanistic modeling approaches capturing properties in individual cells. While <lb/>computational frameworks for the quantitative dynamical modeling of population-level data <lb/>are well established (Balsa-Canto &amp; Banga, 2011; Hoops et al, 2006; Raue et al, 2015), <lb/>mechanistic modeling of single-cell data remains challenging. Available approaches for the <lb/>mechanistic description of cell-to-cell variability include stochastic modeling for gene <lb/>expression (Neuert et al, 2013), mixed-effect modeling for signal transduction (Karlsson et al, <lb/>2015) and a variety of hybrid approaches (Fröhlich et al, 2018; Loos et al, 2018; Toni &amp; Tidor, <lb/>2013; Zechner et al, 2012). However, these mathematical modeling techniques are <lb/>computationally very demanding, which renders model establishment and comparison <lb/>challenging. Therefore, it was of importance to establish a method that enables efficient and <lb/>yet accurate parameter estimation in single-cell models. For the calibration of such <lb/>mathematical models, appropriate quantitative experimental data is required. Recently, <lb/></body>

			<body>single-cell RNA sequencing approaches have been utilized (Buettner et al, 2015; Dalerba et <lb/>al, 2011) to study gene expression in single cells. Clustering algorithms facilitated the <lb/>identification of distinct cell populations based on these data sets. While these data could <lb/>also be employed to analyze cell-to-cell variability in a specific cell population, usually only a <lb/>few hundred unique transcripts are sequenced per cell, limiting the resolution of these <lb/>methods. More importantly, since it has been shown that the correlation between mRNA <lb/>expression levels and protein abundance is low (Schwanhausser et al, 2011) and intracellular <lb/>information processing, which links e.g. changes in ligand concentration to cell fate decisions, <lb/>is executed by complex non-linear reaction networks, it is essential to assess alterations of <lb/>proteins at the single-cell level. While single-cell time-lapse microscopy allows to follow <lb/>changes in proteins in individual cells over time, options for monitoring signal transduction <lb/>components and multiplexing are limited in this technique because only few fluorophores for <lb/>simultaneous quantification are available and the required tagging with fluorophores might <lb/>change the properties of proteins (Weill et al, 2019). In contrast, flow cytometry and mass <lb/>cytometry enable snapshot measurements of dozens of markers in individual cells <lb/>(Bodenmiller et al, 2012; Perfetto et al, 2004). <lb/>Studies combining experimental data and mathematical modeling previously investigated <lb/>molecular mechanisms for cell fate decisions. Several studies suggested that if the <lb/>abundance of certain components exceeds a limit, a cellular decision is taken suggesting the <lb/>existence of an absolute threshold. For example, the absolute abundance of the spindle <lb/>assembly checkpoint proteins were reported to be crucial for mitosis in fission yeast. Because <lb/>even small variations in checkpoint protein abundance can strongly impact spindle assembly <lb/>checkpoint signaling, the level of the relevant checkpoint proteins was shown to be kept <lb/>within a narrow window by stoichiometric inhibition (Heinrich et al, 2013). Likewise, for <lb/>apoptosis mediated by TRAIL in human cell lines, it was demonstrated that naturally occurring <lb/>differences in protein abundances are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing <lb/>and probability of death. If the cellular abundance of tBid reaches a certain value, an <lb/>irreversible process mediated by positive feedback loops is triggered leading to apoptosis <lb/>(Spencer et al, 2009). However, other studies showed that for some cellular decisions, a fold-<lb/>change can be decisive suggesting a relative threshold. For example, it was shown in the Wnt <lb/>signal transduction pathway that gene expression and the embryonic phenotype correlated <lb/>with the fold-change in β-catenin abundance (post stimulation/pre-stimulation), rather than <lb/>the absolute abundance (Goentoro &amp; Kirschner, 2009). Similarly, in the EGF signal <lb/>transduction pathway, H1299 human non-small cell lung cancer cells showed a high cell-to-<lb/>cell variability in ERK2 nuclear abundance. Evidence was provided that the amount of ERK2 <lb/>entering the nucleus upon EGF stimulation is proportional to the basal level of nuclear ERK2 <lb/></body>

			<body>in each cell, suggesting a fold-change response mechanism (Cohen-Saidon et al, 2009). Our <lb/>previous studies on Epo-induced survival of CFU-E cells showed that at the cell population <lb/>level the integration of the amount of nuclear pSTAT5 for 60 min after Epo-stimulation <lb/>correlated with survival of CFU-E cells suggesting that cell survival is an early decision <lb/>(Bachmann et al, 2011). However, it remained unresolved whether in an individual CFU-E cell <lb/>an absolute or relative threshold of pSTAT5 in the nucleus is decisive for Epo-induced cell <lb/>survival. <lb/>Here we report the development of a population average model of the Epo-induced <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway in primary murine erythroid progenitor cells that <lb/>captures cellular population-average data. This model in combination with flow cytometric <lb/>analyses of STAT5 and pSTAT5 is utilized to create a mixed-effect model of pathway <lb/>activation at the single-cell level. Analysis of the single-cell model suggests that a high <lb/>variability in the amounts of the EpoR:JAK2 complex and the phosphatase SHP1 and in the <lb/>nuclear translocation rates of STAT5 contribute to the detected high variability in nuclear <lb/>pSTAT5. With this approach we identify a relative threshold of nuclear pSTAT5 deciding <lb/>survival in CFU-E cells and elucidate the mechanisms converting the switch-like survival <lb/>decision in individual CFU-E cells to a graded response at the population level. <lb/>Results <lb/>Cell-to-cell variability of phosphorylated STAT5 in primary erythroid progenitor <lb/>cells <lb/>As previously reported, the application of an increasing dose of erythropoietin (Epo) results in <lb/>a graded increase of surviving CFU-E erythroid progenitor cells (Bachmann et al, 2011) (Figure <lb/>S1). The key intracellular integrator of Epo-induced survival signal transduction is the latent <lb/>transcription factor STAT5 that is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (pSTAT5). We <lb/>hypothesized that variability in the expression level of total STAT5 in individual cells causes <lb/>variability in pSTAT5 and explains that a binary decision in individual cells is converted to a <lb/>graded response at the cell population level. <lb/>To experimentally evaluate the expression of STAT5 in CFU-E cells, we stimulated the cells <lb/>for 15 min with a broad range of Epo doses that support cell survival (Figure S1) and <lb/>monitored the expression of total STAT5 and of Epo-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 by <lb/>flow cytometry (Figure 1A-E). In this study we used -similar to most studies in the field <lb/>(Herzenberg et al, 2006; Moore &amp; Parks, 2012; Parks et al, 2006) -the logicle scale for the <lb/>visualization and analysis of the flow cytometry data. The logicle scale allows to deal with the <lb/>negative values resulting from signal compensation. <lb/></body>

(A) Unstimulated growth factor-depleted <lb/>CFU-E cells were fixed, permeabilized and intracellularly stained with goat anti-STAT5 primary antibody and anti-<lb/>goat FITC secondary antibody (brown) or only the secondary antibody (grey line). Growth factor-depleted CFU-E <lb/>cells were (B) unstimulated or were stimulated with (C) 0.16 U/ml Epo or (E) 4 U/ml Epo for 15 min and were <lb/>subjected to intracellular staining with rabbit anti-pSTAT5 antibody and with anti-rabbit APC secondary antibody <lb/>-dark grey (unstimulated), blue (0.16 U/ml Epo), purple (4 U/ml Epo) -or secondary antibody only (grey line). Raw <lb/>fluorescence intensities are plotted in a bi-exponential manner and in each panel the corresponding logicle scale <lb/>is indicated. (D) Growth factor-depleted CFU-E cells were stimulated for 20 h with the indicated Epo <lb/>concentrations and the corresponding fraction of surviving CFU-E cells was extrapolated (Figure S1) based on <lb/>previously published data (Bachmann et al, 2011). For each of these Epo concentrations the extracted mean and <lb/>standard deviation (SD) of flow cytometric measurements of total STAT5 and pSTAT5 transformed to the logicle <lb/>scale are displayed. <lb/>As shown in Figure 1A, in unstimulated CFU-E cells, total STAT5 was detected with a mean <lb/>fluorescence intensity of 0.49 on the logicle scale and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.10. <lb/>Intracellular staining with the secondary antibody alone revealed that a substantial fraction of <lb/>the detected signal was due to non-specific binding of the secondary antibody. Upon <lb/>stimulation with increasing doses of Epo the mean fluorescent intensity of total STAT5 varied <lb/>between 0.45 and 0.48 and showed an SD of 0.10 to 0.11 and was thus rather unaffected by <lb/>Epo. The flow cytometric detection of pSTAT5 yielded in the unstimulated situation a mean <lb/>fluorescence intensity of 0.23 and a SD of 0.10. The detected signal was to a large extent <lb/>overlapping with the signal generated by an incubation with the secondary antibody alone <lb/>(Figure 1B). However, upon stimulation with 0.16 U/ml Epo, the mean fluorescence intensity <lb/>measured for pSTAT5 shifted to a higher mean value (0.25) and was distributed more broadly <lb/></body>

			<body>(SD of 0.12) (Figure 1C). This effect was even more pronounced upon stimulation with 4 U/ml <lb/>Epo, with a mean fluorescence intensity of 0.32 and a SD of 0.16 (Figure 1E), which remained <lb/>the same upon adding even higher Epo doses (Figure 1D). While the fraction of surviving cells <lb/>for the respective Epo concentration as interpolated from our previously reported data <lb/>(Bachmann et al, 2011) increased in a graded fashion (Figure S1), the mean fluorescence <lb/>intensities and SD of total STAT5 did not change with increasing Epo doses. On the contrary, <lb/>for pSTAT5 we observed a gradual increase in the mean fluorescence intensity that saturated <lb/>similar to the Epo-induced cell survival at a concentration of 4 U/ml Epo. Interestingly, the SD <lb/>observed for pSTAT5 was considerably larger than for total STAT5 and showed an increase <lb/>in response to rising Epo doses that correlated with the survival responses (Figure 1D). <lb/>Thus, we concluded that cell-to-cell variability in the expression of total STAT5 alone was not <lb/>sufficient to explain the Epo dose-dependent increase in the variance of the key integrator of <lb/>survival signaling pSTAT5. Rather, variability in components and non-linear reactions <lb/>controlling the formation of pSTAT5 might have a major impact on survival decisions in <lb/>individual cells. <lb/>Dynamical modeling of Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction at the <lb/>population level <lb/>To identify pathway components and reaction rates in the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway <lb/>that vary from cell to cell and could cause the observed variability in STAT5 phosphorylation, <lb/>a strategy had to be developed that permits an in-depth analysis of cell-to-cell variability by <lb/>mechanistic modeling. <lb/>First, we established a mechanistic mathematical model which describes the system on a <lb/>population-average level utilizing our previously published mathematical model of the <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway. This model consists of coupled ordinary differential <lb/>equations (ODE) and describes Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling and cell survival at the <lb/>cell population level (Bachmann et al, 2011) (Figure 2A). So far, calibration of model <lb/>parameters in dynamic pathway models was performed using quantitative immunoblotting <lb/>data, quantitative mass spectrometry and qRT-PCR data that assess the average dynamic <lb/>behavior of the cell population. However, flow cytometry offers the advantage to determine <lb/>the average behavior of the cell population by calculating the mean fluorescence intensities, <lb/>but also provides information on the distribution of the fluorescence intensity across the cell <lb/>population and thus enables a link to the single-cell level. Therefore, to calibrate the <lb/>parameters of our population average model, we collected quantitative data acquired in CFU-<lb/>E cells with a wide variety of experimental approaches and conditions: (i) Quantitative <lb/>immunoblotting analysis of total cell lysates for pSTAT5 and tSTAT5 and of cytoplasmic <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>lysates for pEpoR, pJAK2, CIS, SOCS3 and SHP1 served as a readout to determine the <lb/>average Epo-induced activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (Figure 2B and S2 B5, B7, C5-<lb/>C6, D1-D4, D7-E4, E6-F2, F5-G4, G6, H7, K1-K4, K6-K7). (ii) Targeted mass spectrometry <lb/>using one-source peptide/phosphopeptide ratio standards (Boehm et al, 2014) allowed to <lb/>determine relative average amounts of pSTAT5 in response to Epo stimulation (Figure 2C and <lb/>S2 L1, L2). (iii) Cell fractionation experiments, separating the cytoplasmic and the nuclear <lb/>compartment, provided access to the average dynamics of pSTAT5 localization (Figure 2D-E <lb/>and S2 B1-B4, B6, C1-C4, C7, D5, D6, E5, F3, F4, G5, G7, H6, K5). (iv) qRT-PCR experiments <lb/>(Figure S2 I5-I7, J1-J7) revealed the induction dynamics of the transcriptional feedbacks. (v) <lb/>The mean fluorescence intensities of the flow cytometry data on pSTAT5 provided time and <lb/>Epo-dose resolved information on the average pSTAT5 concentration in the cell population <lb/>(Figure 2F and S2 A1-A3, B7). Altogether a curated data set of 516 published data points <lb/>(Bachmann et al, 2011) and 469 newly acquired data points providing information on the <lb/>average dynamic behavior of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in the cell population was assembled <lb/>(Figure 2G). A major challenge for the calibration of the population-average model was the <lb/>use of data with such different scaling and error structures, e.g. immunoblotting data and flow <lb/>cytometry data. It turned out that it is crucial to simultaneously estimate model parameters <lb/>and the measurement noise (Raue et al, 2013) on the scale given by the measurement <lb/>technique: The measured values are given for immunoblotting and qRT-PCR measurements <lb/>on a log10 scale (Kreutz et al, 2007), for mass spectrometry as a percentage of pSTAT5 relative <lb/>to total STAT5 (Boehm et al, 2014) and for flow cytometry data on a logicle scale (Moore &amp; <lb/>Parks, 2012). For the estimation of the model parameters based on these data sets we used <lb/>a multi-start local optimization. Additionally, we reduced the complexity of the model without <lb/>substantially impairing the model agreement to the comprehensive data set. We applied an <lb/>iterative method, which relies on profile likelihood calculation (Maiwald et al, 2016). The <lb/>resulting population-average model (Figure 2A) differed from the previously published model <lb/>in three aspects: (i) SHP1 activation was simplified by considering the total amount of SHP1 <lb/>as not-limiting, (ii) SOCS3 transcription and translation process were summarized in a single <lb/>reaction and (iii) the CIS transcriptional delay was shortened, which was modeled by the linear <lb/>chain trick (MacDonald, 1976) (for details and biological interpretation, see STAR Methods <lb/>section &quot;Model reduction&quot;). Calibrating the reduced model to the experimental data showed <lb/>a favorable convergence (Raue et al, 2013) during parameter optimization (Figure 2H), a good <lb/>agreement (see Figure S2) and a high correlation (𝜌=0.978, see Figure S4A, B) of experimental <lb/>data and model output for the best fit. The profile likelihood calculation revealed that 19 out <lb/>of 21 of the estimated dynamic parameters of the population-average model are practically <lb/>identifiable at a confidence level of 95%, and all 21 parameters are practically identifiable at <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>a confidence level of 68% (Figure S3). Accordingly, the calibrated population-average model <lb/>accurately described the experimental data (Figure S2). For example, the mathematical model <lb/>was capable to capture the dynamics of pSTAT5 upon stimulation of CFU-E cells with 5 U/ml <lb/>Epo such as the rapid activation dynamics with a peak of absolute pSTAT5 at 33 min <lb/>measured by quantitative immunoblotting in the whole cell lysates (Figure 2B) and the sharp <lb/>peak of 67% phosphorylation of cytoplasmic STAT5 at 23 min returning to a steady state level <lb/>of 24% after 120 min as determined by quantitative mass spectrometry (Figure 2C). <lb/>Furthermore, by cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting analysis, a peak of absolute <lb/>pSTAT5 was detected at 13 min after stimulation with 5 U/ml Epo in the cytoplasmic lysates <lb/>of CFU-E cells (Figure 2D), while nuclear pSTAT5 was rather sustained (Figure 2E) and both <lb/>features were faithfully represented by the mathematical model. Likewise, the mathematical <lb/>model was able to describe the Epo dose-dependent shift of the peak of STAT5 <lb/>phosphorylation in CFU-E cells to earlier time points with a peak at 82 min for 0.032 U/ml <lb/>Epo, a peak at 46 min for 0.8 U/ml Epo and a peak at 28 min for 20 U/ml Epo, as measured <lb/>by flow cytometry (Figure 2F). Finally, the mathematical model was also able to describe <lb/>dynamics of STAT5 phosphorylation detected for the stimulation with additional Epo doses <lb/>(Figure S2). <lb/>To conclude, we established a calibrated population-average model for the JAK2/STAT5 <lb/>signal transduction pathway in CFU-E cells that is capable to accurately describe the <lb/>dynamics of pathway activation in these cells including the average level of pSTAT5 measured <lb/>by flow cytometry, which thereby forms the basis for the analysis of the pathway at the single-<lb/>cell level. <lb/></body>

A faithful representation of the cell-to-cell variability at a given time point in a cell <lb/>population had to be balanced with computational costs of the utilized multi-start parameter <lb/>estimation. Because the number of molecules ranged from around 1000 molecules for the <lb/>EpoR to around 20 000 molecules per cell for STAT5 (Bachmann et al, 2011) and was <lb/>therefore sufficiently large, we employed a deterministic mixed-effect modeling approach <lb/>(Fröhlich et al, 2017). Mixed-effect modeling allowed each parameter to be either fixed or <lb/>variable across cells. Parameters, which are assumed to be variable across cells, were <lb/>referred to as &quot;random effects&quot;, otherwise they were called &quot;fixed effects&quot;. Random effects <lb/>should follow a multivariate normal distribution, which was parametrized by the population <lb/>mean and a covariance matrix. Hence, compared to the population-average JAK2/STAT5 <lb/>model, the single-cell JAK2/SAT5 model was extended by additional degrees of freedom, <lb/>which parametrize the covariance matrix of the random effects. <lb/>The calibration of the single-cell model was computationally much more demanding, because <lb/>(i) the additional degrees of freedom increased the dimensionality of the estimation problem, <lb/>and (ii) the evaluation of the cell-population dynamics required a large number of single-cell <lb/>simulations, with parameters sampled from the multivariate normal distribution. Hence, we <lb/>had to improve the feasibility of previously proposed approximation methods. The key <lb/>challenge was the computational complexity of simulating the population dynamics, a step <lb/>which needs to be repeated during every step of the model calibration. To reduce the <lb/>computational costs, the mean and the covariance can be approximated using sigma points <lb/>(Loos et al, 2018; Toni &amp; Tidor, 2013). However, as shown in Figure 3A, this method possesses <lb/>a low accuracy for the considered problem. Thus, we introduced a Dirac-mixture distribution <lb/>(Gilitschenski &amp; Hanebeck, 2013), which allows for a high approximation accuracy via the <lb/>specification of an appropriate number of samples. The sample points were chosen such that <lb/>the corresponding Dirac-mixture distribution provided an accurate approximation of the <lb/></body>

			<body>multivariate normal distribution (Hanebeck &amp; Klumpp, 2008) describing cell-to-cell variability <lb/>(Figure 3B). We used 42 sample points for this approximation, thus we required about 250 <lb/>times fewer simulations than for a corresponding Monte-Carlo-based trajectory (Figure 3C). <lb/>Our approach allowed to flexibly balancing the computational complexity, as determined by <lb/>the number of points, and approximation accuracy. The validity of this approximation, on <lb/>which all results of the parameter estimation and the model selection relied, was ensured by <lb/>comparing the final approximate simulations after the model calibration (Figure 3B) to an <lb/>accurate Monte Carlo simulation with 10 000 samples, which is considered to be as close as <lb/>possible to the truth (Figure 3C). To further enhance computational efficiency and optimizer <lb/>convergence, we derived the respective forward sensitivity equations for the gradient <lb/>calculations, optimized logicle-and log-transformed parameters and used a novel <lb/>parametrization approach for the covariance matrix (for details, see STAR Methods). <lb/>Figure 3: Modeling of population-average dynamics.

			<body>parameter estimation method for the single-cell model, we enabled its calibration using a <lb/>combination of population-average and single-cell snapshot data. <lb/>Model selection reveals that abundance of pathway components and <lb/>nucleocytoplasmic transport rates determine cell-to-cell variability of pSTAT5 <lb/>Based on the data shown in Figure 1, we hypothesized that the cell-to-cell variability of <lb/>phosphorylated STAT5 arises from the variability in the abundance of components or reaction <lb/>rates of the Epo-induced-JAK2/STAT5 pathway that determine the formation of nuclear <lb/>pSTAT5 in individual cells. Because the high variability of pSTAT5 was already present 15 min <lb/>after Epo stimulation, when CIS and SOCS3 were not yet expressed (Figure S2 D3/4, E3/4, <lb/>F5, G3/4, G6), we excluded contributions arising from transcription or translation rates of <lb/>these negative feedback regulators to the cell-to-cell variability. To identify the relevant <lb/>components and reactions and to quantify their contribution to the variability of <lb/>phosphorylated STAT5, we established three nested single-cell models (Single-Cell Model 1-<lb/>3). <lb/>For Single-Cell Model 1 we considered our previously established concept that intracellular <lb/>information processing is largely determined by the abundance of signaling components <lb/>(Adlung et al, 2017) and allowed the initial amount of EpoR, SHP1 and total STAT5 to vary <lb/>between cells. Additionally, the measured basal phosphorylation of STAT5 was represented <lb/>by a cell-specific offset parameter, which comprised ligand-independent phosphorylation and <lb/>the background-signal of the secondary antibodies (see Figure 1A). Accordingly, these <lb/>parameters of an individual cell were a combination of fixed and random effects, while all <lb/>other parameters were only defined by fixed effects (for details, see STAR Methods). To <lb/>account for interdependencies between the initial amount of EpoR, SHP1 and total STAT5 as <lb/>well as the pSTAT5 offset (i.e. basal activation plus measurement background), we estimated <lb/>variances as well as the full covariance structure of the random effects (Figure 4B, blue). <lb/>In Single-Cell Model 2 we additionally assumed that the nucleocytoplasmic import and export <lb/>rate constants are variable between cells, since we showed previously that due to the rapid <lb/>nucleocytoplasmic cycling behavior of STAT5, both the nucleocytoplasmic import and export <lb/>rates strongly influence the transcriptional yield of nuclear pSTAT5 (Swameye et al, 2003). <lb/>This could be due to cell-to-cell variability in the cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes of CFU-E <lb/>cells, which influences the effective import and export rates of individual CFU-E cells (for <lb/>details, see STAR Methods). We estimated covariances between these two parameters to <lb/>account for their correlation, but we disregarded possible interdependencies between the <lb/>translocation rate constants and other entries of the covariance matrix to limit the overall <lb/>complexity (Figure 4B, green). <lb/></body>

			<body>In Single-Cell Model 3, we further allowed the input Epo to vary between cells, since we <lb/>previously observed rapid receptor-mediated ligand internalization (Becker et al, 2010) and <lb/>therefore considered the possibility of an uneven distribution of the ligand in the medium or <lb/>differential ligand accessibility of individual CFU-E cells. We considered the random effect of <lb/>Epo to be independent from the other cell-to-cell variabilities (Figure 4B, orange). <lb/>Figure 4.

(G) Bayesian information <lb/>criterion (BIC) values of the three candidate models. <lb/>Each of the three single-cell models was calibrated by multi-start local optimization with <lb/>analytical gradient information of the aforementioned approximation using Dirac-mixture <lb/>distributions. In addition to the population-average data used for the population-average <lb/>model (Figure 4C-E, upper panels), the three single-cell models were also parameterized <lb/>using variances of total STAT5 and pSTAT5 (Figure 4C-E, lower panels), and their <lb/>covariances, and the means of total STAT5 as measured by flow cytometry, which comprised <lb/>a total of 960 additional data points. As demonstrated in Figure 4F, the optimizations for all <lb/>three single-cell models converged well. We performed model selection using the Bayesian <lb/>information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) and found that Single-Cell Model 2 provides an <lb/>appropriate balance between goodness-of-fit and model complexity (Figure 4G). The optimal <lb/>values of the log-likelihood functions for Single-Cell Model 2 and 3 were identical, and the <lb/>difference of 7.5 in the BIC values was due to the penalization of the additional parameters of <lb/>Single-Cell Model 3. The additional random effect of Epo implemented in Single-Cell Model 3 <lb/>did not improve the model&apos;s performance. Overall, there was a good agreement and high <lb/>correlation (𝜌=0.974, see Figure S4C, D) between model simulations and experimental data <lb/>(Figure 4C-E), but the single-cell model output was markedly improved by assuming cell-to-<lb/>cell variability in the import rate of pSTAT5 and the export rate of STAT5 in Model 2 (Figure <lb/>4D). <lb/>In summary, model selection identified Single-Cell Model 2 that considers cell-to-cell <lb/>variability for the initial amount of EpoR, SHP1 and total STAT5, as well a cell-specific offset <lb/>for pSTAT5, and cell specific nucleocytoplasmic import and export rate constants of STAT5, <lb/>as most suitable to represent the comprehensive experimental data. Thus, we demonstrated <lb/>that variability in protein abundance of pathway components and in nucleocytoplasmic <lb/>translocation of STAT5 had a major influence on Epo-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in <lb/>individual CFU-E cells and proceeded with this model structure. <lb/>Predictions of cell-to-cell variability in individual cellular states and rate <lb/>constants <lb/>To validate our parameter estimation method based on Dirac-mixture distributions, we <lb/>compared the single-cell JAK2/STAT5 model output of the distributions of pSTAT5 and total <lb/>STAT5 to the flow cytometry data for the time-course at 4 U/ml Epo.

			<body>agreement of the mean (Figure 5A, circles) and covariances (Figure 5A, crosses) computed <lb/>from the flow cytometry measurements and the simulation of the single-cell JAK2/STAT5 <lb/>model. As these means and covariances were used in the parameter estimation process, this <lb/>was unsurprising. However, we further compared the population densities, corresponding to <lb/>two-dimensional histograms with total STAT5 versus pSTAT5 at each time point. Although <lb/>these densities have not been considered for parameter estimation, the simulated density <lb/>plots based on the mathematical model and the experimentally determined density plots <lb/>based on flow cytometry of total STAT5 versus pSTAT5 were comparable (Figure 5A, shades <lb/>of purple). <lb/>To identify the pathway components and reactions rates that were responsible for the cell-<lb/>to-cell variability of phosphorylated STAT5, we plotted the fitted variances and covariances <lb/>of the random effects (Figure 5B). Based on the model calibration, we predicted higher <lb/>variances for the membrane-associated EpoR:JAK2 complex and for SHP1 than for total <lb/>STAT5. Additionally, the inferred covariance matrix revealed correlations between individual <lb/>cellular states. For instance, the model simulation suggested that the initial abundances of <lb/>the EpoR:JAK2 complex and SHP1 exhibit a positive correlation of ρ=0.8. The positive <lb/>correlation argued for post-transcriptional co-regulation of the receptor-phosphatase <lb/>complex for example due to the recruitment of the phosphatase to the phosphorylated EpoR <lb/>and joint internalization as well as degradation of the SHP1 and the EpoR:JAK2 complex. <lb/>Further, the model simulations revealed a strong negative correlation between the initial <lb/>abundance of SHP1 and total STAT5. Because STAT5 is a direct target gene of the <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 pathway, this negative correlation of protein abundance might be due to <lb/>transcriptional downregulation of STAT5 in cells with high SHP1 abundance due to enhanced <lb/>termination of signal transduction through the EpoR. <lb/></body>

Interestingly, the inferred variance for the nuclear import of <lb/>pSTAT5 was larger than the inferred variance of the nuclear export of STAT5 (Figure 6A). We <lb/>quantified this by the ratio of their coefficients of variation, which we assessed by simulating <lb/>1000 in-silico populations with 100 000 CFU-E cells each.

			<body>computation of the dependence of expected translocation times of these two quantities <lb/>(Figure 6C) confirmed this assumptions. <lb/>To experimentally validate the prediction of this ratio of variability in the rate constants of <lb/>STAT5 nuclear translocation, we measured the cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes of CFU-E <lb/>cells. We stained the plasma membrane and the nucleus of CFU-E cells and reconstructed <lb/>their 3D structure from confocal fluorescence microscope z-stack images (Figure 6D). In <lb/>agreement with the predictions of our single-cell JAK2/STAT5 model, the measured nuclear <lb/>volume of CFU-E cells, which we considered as a proxy for the nuclear export rate constants, <lb/>showed lower variance than the measured cytoplasmic volume, which we consider as a proxy <lb/>for the thickness of the cytoplasmic shell and hence for the nuclear import constants <lb/>(Figure 6E). Furthermore, we quantified the ratio of the coefficients of variation of the <lb/>corresponding quantities to be <lb/>&quot;#;thickness of cytoplasmic shell B C <lb/>&quot;#(radius of nucleus core B ) <lb/>= 3.1, <lb/>which was in line with our model prediction. In conclusion, we identified that besides STAT5, <lb/>variability of the EpoR:JAK2 complex and SHP1 as well as of the nuclear import and export <lb/>rates of STAT5 are responsible for the cell-to-cell variability of STAT5 phosphorylation. The <lb/>variability of the nuclear import rate is a consequence of the large cell-to-cell variability of the <lb/>cytoplasmic volumes of CFU-E cells. <lb/>Figure 6.

(E) Distributions of reconstructed <lb/>cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes from CFU-E cells are shown (n=58 cells). See Figure S6 for the volume of nucleus <lb/>and cytoplasm in relation to the volume of the whole cell. <lb/>Threshold of nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 determines cell survival <lb/>In each individual CFU-E cell survival is ensured by the Epo-induced production of <lb/>phosphorylated STAT5 that enters the nucleus and induces sufficient amounts of anti-<lb/>apoptotic gene products. However, it remained unresolved (i) whether the model-predicted <lb/>cell-to-cell variability of nuclear pSTAT5 was sufficient to explain the experimentally observed <lb/>survival data, (ii) whether the cells had to acquire a certain amount of nuclear pSTAT5, <lb/>corresponding to an absolute threshold, or (iii) whether a certain fraction of total STAT5 was <lb/>required to be phosphorylated and in the nucleus, corresponding to a relative threshold. To <lb/>address these questions, we established a link between the abundance of nuclear pSTAT5 in <lb/>each cell given by the single-cell mathematical model of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway to the <lb/>observed probability for cell survival, depending on the Epo dose. The calibrated single-cell <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 model was used to simulate the amount of pSTAT5 in the nucleus in each <lb/>individual cell for different Epo concentrations for time windows between 30 and 180 min. For <lb/>each of these time windows, the area-under-curve of the nuclear pSTAT5 was calculated for <lb/>all applied Epo doses and divided by the corresponding time window to obtain the time-<lb/>averaged abundance of nuclear pSTAT5. Subsequently, the time-averaged abundance of <lb/>nuclear pSTAT5 was compared to the fraction of surviving cells at the corresponding Epo <lb/>concentrations. We tested with our single-cell JAK2/STAT5 model if a relative threshold, <lb/>indicating that a certain fraction of total STAT5 has to be phosphorylated and present in the <lb/>nucleus to ensure cell survival, or an absolute threshold, meaning that a certain number of <lb/>nuclear pSTAT5 molecules is required to ensure CFU-E survival, is more consistent with the <lb/>experimental data. For both single-cell JAK2/STAT5 models we fitted the threshold for <lb/>different time windows by simulating a population of 10 000 cells and compared the <lb/>respective goodness-of-fit to the survival data (Figure S7A). The results indicated that the <lb/>single-cell model realizing a relative threshold to be significantly more informative than the <lb/>single-cell model with an absolute threshold. Further, the results indicated that the optimal <lb/>time frame for integrating the amount of nuclear pSTAT5 was the first 120 min after Epo <lb/></body>

			<body>stimulation. The model simulation considering a relative threshold for the nuclear pSTAT5, <lb/>calculated for a time window of 120 min after Epo stimulation, was in line with the <lb/>experimentally observed data of the fraction of surviving CFU-E upon stimulation with <lb/>increasing Epo concentrations (Figure 7A). Additionally, the model simulations predicted that <lb/>a surprisingly low fraction of about 0.29% of the total STAT5 had to be present as pSTAT5 in <lb/>the nucleus to ensure the survival of an individual CFU-E cell (Figure 7B and Figure S7B). This <lb/>means that 24 to 118 pSTAT5 molecules are required in the nucleus of a single cell for 120 <lb/>min, corresponding to 12 to 59 pSTAT5 dimers. <lb/>To determine which of the components of the JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway with <lb/>a considerable cell-to-cell variability primarily determine the Epo-dependent life-or-death <lb/>decision in individual CFU-E cells, the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus versus the parameter <lb/>values of these components in single cells was plotted and surviving and apoptotic cells were <lb/>indicated. While the amount of the EpoR:JAK2 complex (Figure 7C) and SHP1 (Figure 7D) <lb/>vary substantially in individual cells, only a weak positive correlation of the EpoR:JAK2 <lb/>complex and a weak negative correlation of SHP1 with the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus <lb/>and thus survival was detected. However, for low amounts of EpoR:JAK2, there was a distinct <lb/>positive correlation with with the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus, which turned into a negative <lb/>correlation for higher amounts of EpoR:JAK2. The same effect was observed for SHP1, <lb/>although here the negative correlation area was more pronounced. This quadratic <lb/>dependence emerged from a positive correlation of EpoR:JAK2 and a negative correlation of <lb/>SHP1 with the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus. A common internalization and degradation of <lb/>the activated complex and the activated negative regulator might result in this strong <lb/>correlation of total EpoR:JAK2 and total SHP1 (cf. Figure 5B), which leads to this turning <lb/>effect. The amount of total STAT5, while not having a large coefficient of variation, positively <lb/>correlated with the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus (Figure 7E), while the estimated offset of <lb/>pSTAT5 in the cytoplasm was not correlated. Interestingly, a positive correlation with the <lb/>fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus was predicted for the STAT5 import rate (Figure 7G), whereas <lb/>on the other hand the STAT5 export rate showed a weak negative correlation with the fraction <lb/>of STAT5 in the nucleus of individual CFU-E cells stimulated with Epo (Figure 7H). <lb/>Taken together, we confirmed that cell-to-cell variability in Epo-induced phosphorylated <lb/>STAT5 is derived from several non-linear regulatory steps. A surprisingly low threshold <lb/>amount of total STAT5 present as pSTAT5 in the nucleus of an individual CFU-E cell is <lb/>sufficient to prevent apoptosis and ensure survival of CFU-E cells upon stimulation with Epo. <lb/>We demonstrated that the STAT5 import rate, which depends on the cytoplasmic volume, <lb/>had the largest contribution to the fraction of STAT5 in the nucleus and thus to survival of <lb/>individual CFU-E cells. <lb/></body>

The number of EpoR:JAK2 complexes, as well as the abundance of the <lb/>phosphatase SHP1 and the cytoplasmic volume are responsible for the variability in STAT5 <lb/>phosphorylation in CFU-E cells upon Epo stimulation. In addition, we identified a relative <lb/>threshold of 0.29% of total STAT5 being present as pSTAT5 in the nucleus, which <lb/>corresponds to as little as 24 to 118 molecules of nuclear pSTAT5 in single CFU-E cells, that <lb/>is required for the survival of CFU-E cells upon Epo stimulation. <lb/>CFU-E cells exhibit the advantage that they rely on Epo as the only factor ensuring cell <lb/>survival, proliferation and differentiation, which was demonstrated in vitro by colony formation <lb/>(Cooper et al, 1974) and verified in vivo using knock-out mice lacking either Epo or its receptor <lb/>(Wu et al, 1995). Additionally, by deletion of the STAT5a and STAT5b genes it was shown that <lb/></body>

			<body>survival is primarily controlled by the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (Socolovsky et al, 2001). Binding <lb/>studies with 125 I-Epo revealed that murine erythroid progenitor cells exhibit differences in their <lb/>binding capacities suggesting that the amount of Epo-receptors present on their cell surface <lb/>is heterogenous (Kelley et al, 1993). We found that variability in the number of EpoR:JAK2 <lb/>complexes contributes to the cell-to-cell variability in nuclear pSTAT5 in CFU-E cells. In line <lb/>with our findings, it was shown that variability in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor <lb/>(EGFR) accounts for cell-to-cell variability in the amount of ERK in the nucleus of rat PC12 <lb/>pheochromocytoma cells stimulated with EGF (Iwamoto et al, 2016). <lb/>Based on theoretical analysis of mathematical models of IFNγ-induced JAK/STAT1 signal <lb/>transduction it was proposed that the structure of the JAK/STAT pathway renders the <lb/>pathway relatively insensitive to fluctuations of kinetic parameters and thus ensures <lb/>robustness (Shudo et al, 2007). Compared to other malignancies of myeloid hematopoiesis, <lb/>acute erythroleukemia is very rare as it represents only 1% of overall de novo AML (Boddu et <lb/>al, 2018), which could in part be attributed to robustness of the Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 <lb/>pathway controlling survival of erythroid progenitor cells. Possibly, because the latent <lb/>transcription factor STAT5 permits a direct link from the activated EpoR at the cell surface to <lb/>target gene expression in the nucleus and thereby facilitates cell survival decisions within two <lb/>hours, the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is less error-prone than more complex pathways with signal <lb/>amplifications, such as the MAP-kinase pathway that is frequently mutated in human cancer <lb/>(Dhillon et al, 2007). <lb/>While cell fate decisions such as survival or apoptosis are inherently switch-like, at the cell <lb/>population level the relationship between Epo concentration and fraction of surviving cells <lb/>shows a graded response curve (Bachmann et al, 2011). Using T cell activation as an <lb/>example, Zikherman and Au-Yeung recently reviewed how cell-to-cell variability can <lb/>transform single-cell digital behavior into analog behavior at the population level. At the <lb/>single-cell level T cells exhibit high variability with respect to their integrated response of T <lb/>cell receptor signaling. The broad distribution of responses in individual cells leads to a <lb/>graded dose response at the cell population level and enables the T cell population to <lb/>distinguish a broad range of antigen dose (Zikherman &amp; Au-Yeung, 2015). <lb/>The analysis of our mathematical model identified the hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase <lb/>SHP1 as another key component contributing to the observed variability in nuclear pSTAT5 <lb/>in CFU-E cells upon Epo stimulation. The abundance of SHP1, a phosphatase that is activated <lb/>by the recruitment to the tyrosin phosphorylated EpoR (Klingmüller et al, 1996), is positively <lb/>correlated with the amount of the EpoR:JAK2 complex and negatively correlated with the <lb/>abundance of total STAT5. The positive correlation of the abundance of SHP1 with the <lb/>amount of the EpoR:JAK2 complex is in line with the mass spectrometric observation that the <lb/></body>

			<body>abundance of proteins forming a common complex is often highly correlated (Wilhelm et al, <lb/>2014). The results obtained by metabolic pulse-chase labeling and quantitative mass <lb/>spectrometry showed that the degradation rates of the free and the bound form differ <lb/>(McShane et al, 2016) and thus provide a potential explanation for the observed correlation <lb/>of protein abundance in complexes. Since STAT5 induces its own expression (Yamaji et al, <lb/>2013) and the recruitment of the negative regulator SHP1 to the phosphorylated EpoR:JAK2 <lb/>complex terminates STAT5 signal transduction, heterogeneity in SHP1 levels potentiates the <lb/>variability in total STAT5 expression across the cell population. This potentiation, together <lb/>with the heterogeneity in the EpoR:JAK2 complex, contributes to the even higher cell-to-cell <lb/>variability of pSTAT5 in the nucleus of individual CFU-E cells. Therefore, we speculate that <lb/>the non-linear impact of SHP1 on both the EpoR:JAK2 complex and on total STAT5 causes <lb/>that CFU-E cells with an intermediate level of SHP1 are most likely to survive upon Epo <lb/>stimulation. <lb/>Furthermore, we found that the STAT5 import rate, which depends on the cytoplasmic <lb/>volume, had the largest contribution to the heterogeneity in survival of individual CFU-E cells <lb/>upon Epo stimulation. In general, nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation rates depend on <lb/>compartment volumes as proposed by Chara and Brusch (2015). Here, we show a tight <lb/>coupling between STAT5 transport parameters and cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic volumes. The <lb/>large variability in the nuclear import rate of STAT5 in CFU-E cells identified with the model is <lb/>explained by the experimentally observed large cell-to-cell variability of the cytoplasmic <lb/>volume of CFU-E cells. This variability in volume might originate from two major sources: It <lb/>was reported that CFU-E cells can ex vivo undergo up to four divisions within 27 h and thus <lb/>exhibit a rather short cell cycle duration (Nijhof et al, 1984), which might propagate volumetric <lb/>fluctuations due to rapid successions of cell division. Further, during the differentiation of <lb/>CFU-E cells to erythroblasts, the cell volume decreases gradually. The proposed <lb/>interdependency between CFU-E cell cycle progression and differentiation (Pop et al, 2010) <lb/>could lead to a propagation of the variability that occurs in the cytoplasmic volumes during <lb/>the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when CFU-E cells have to grow rapidly to reach a critical size <lb/>for division and differentiation. <lb/>The observed larger variability in nuclear import of pSTAT5 compared to nuclear export of <lb/>pSTAT5 could be explained by recently reported observations suggesting that binding of <lb/>transcription factors to DNA can act as a passive noise filter and reduce the cell-to-cell <lb/>variability in nuclear export processes (Battich et al, 2015; Stoeger et al, 2016). The <lb/>comparison of Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling between mouse CFU-E cells and the <lb/>human lung cancer cell line H838 by employing L1 regularization to infer cell type-specific <lb/>parameters in the mathematical model predicted that one of the seven parameters <lb/></body>

			<body>differentially regulated between the cell types was the import rate of pSTAT5 to the nucleus <lb/>(Merkle et al, 2016) underscoring the potential importance of nuclear import of pSTAT5 for <lb/>the outcome of the response. <lb/>Strikingly, the three components or processes contributing most to the cell-to-cell variability <lb/>of pSTAT5 in the nucleus are membrane-linked: EpoR:JAK2 and SHP1, which is activated by <lb/>recruitment to the phosphorylated EpoR (Klingmüller et al, 1996), are localized in the plasma <lb/>membrane and nuclear import of STAT5 occurs by translocation through the nuclear <lb/>membrane. Likewise, a previously reported microscopy-based study analysing factors <lb/>contributing to cell-to-cell variability of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection revealed that the cell-<lb/>to-cell variability of SV40 infection was caused by differences in the abundance of the <lb/>sphingolipid GM1 and of the membrane-associated protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK) <lb/>(Snijder et al, 2009). This indicates that membrane-associated processes frequently exhibit <lb/>large cell-to-cell variability and are decisive for the regulation of cell fate decisions in single <lb/>cells. <lb/>Our study provides evidence that the threshold of pSTAT5 in the nucleus necessary in the <lb/>first 120 min after Epo stimulation to ensure survival of a single CFU-E cell is established by <lb/>a relative fraction of 0.29% of total STAT5. Depending on the cellular amount of total STAT5, <lb/>this corresponds to 24 to 118 molecules of pSTAT5 present in the nucleus of a CFU-E cell in <lb/>the first two hours after Epo stimulation. Recently, Frick et al. suggested based on their single-<lb/>molecule FISH studies of the TGFb/SMAD signal transduction pathway, in particular the <lb/>dynamics of SMAD3 nuclear translocation and corresponding gene expression, that relative <lb/>amounts of transcription factors represent a robust feature to transmit information from the <lb/>extracellular medium to the nucleus despite cell-to-cell variability in cellular components <lb/>(Frick et al, 2017). Given our findings this property may also apply to the JAK2/STAT5 signal <lb/>transduction pathway. <lb/>Since we developed a mechanism-based mathematical model of the Epo-stimulated <lb/>JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway in individual CFU-E cells, the model parameters are <lb/>directly interpretable. On the contrary, the majority of currently pursued mathematical models <lb/>remain phenomenological and contain parameters that frequently do not have a direct <lb/>representation. Data based on single-cell mRNA sequencing in several systems has <lb/>demonstrated large variability on the mRNA level across cell populations (Buettner et al, 2015; <lb/>Dalerba et al, 2011). However, it remains unresolved to which extent these differences are <lb/>translated to variability at the proteome level, in particular since it was reported that the <lb/>correlation of mRNA expression and protein abundance in mammalian cells can be rather low <lb/>(Schwanhausser et al, 2011). Furthermore, in these studies dynamic changes in the extent of <lb/>post-translational modifications are not captured, which are essential for signal transduction <lb/></body>

			<body>and therefore the regulation of cell fate decisions. Currently, to propose temporal ordering <lb/>and cell fate hierarchies, frequently diffusion pseudotime is estimated from single-cell <lb/>snapshot expression data (Haghverdi et al, 2016). However, the relationship of this <lb/>pseudotime to the actual time of each single-cell trajectory is complex. In our study we <lb/>estimated that a time window of 120 min is required for connecting the nuclear pSTAT5 with <lb/>cell survival in individual CFU-E cells. This time window estimated for individual CFU-E cells <lb/>is considerably prolonged compared to the 60 min identified for the cell population to be <lb/>sufficient to link the integral of pSTAT5 to the survival of CFU-E cells (Bachmann et al, 2011), <lb/>demonstrating that the time frame of an individual cell can be different from the average <lb/>population response. <lb/>The identification of the causes and consequences of cell-to-cell variability in the JAK2/STAT5 <lb/>signal transduction pathway in CFU-E cells was only possible by developing a mechanism-<lb/>based single-cell model that required the combination of experimental data obtained at the <lb/>population-average and at the single-cell level together with the identification of Dirac-mixture <lb/>distributions as a suitable approximation approach. Similar to signal transduction addressed <lb/>in this study, transcriptional regulation can now be experimentally addressed using genome-<lb/>wide population-average measurements and single-molecule techniques and also there it <lb/>was realized that it is crucial to combine these information levels and consider the binding <lb/>energy of transcription factors to DNA as well as the different rates of transcription initiation <lb/>to develop a quantitative model of transcriptional regulation (Coulon et al, 2013). <lb/>In conclusion, we present a two-step mathematical modeling strategy to integrate population <lb/>average data and single-cell data to determine a threshold for binary cell fate decisions. This <lb/>approach is scalable and can readily be applied to other cell fate decisions such as <lb/>proliferation, migration and differentiation that are controlled by multiple transcription factors <lb/>in health and disease. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">METHOD DETAILS <lb/>Mathematical modeling of population-average data <lb/>Model topology and data integration <lb/>The published ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and the corresponding experimental <lb/>data (Bachmann et al, 2011) were used as a basis for the mathematical modeling. To ensure <lb/>comparability on absolute scales with the mixed-effect models, parameter transformations <lb/>implemented in the published model were avoided. To focus the analysis, we neglected the <lb/>nine data points for the CIS overexpression condition and removed the mechanism of <lb/>unspecific binding of CIS to EpoR in the absence of Epo. These adaptions reduced the <lb/>computational effort when simulating the model output without dropping any other key <lb/>features of the original model. Complementary, the error of relative pSTAT measured by mass <lb/>spectrometry was kept constant to 5.55% as previously defined (Boehm et al, 2014; Hahn et <lb/>al, 2013). <lb/>The fluorescence intensities recorded in the flow cytometry experiments were transformed to <lb/>logicle scale, which is a biexponential scale (Herzenberg et al, 2006; Moore &amp; Parks, 2012; <lb/>Parks et al, 2006): <lb/>𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 L,N,O,P,Q (𝑥) = 𝑎 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑏𝑥) − 𝑐 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑑𝑥) + 𝑓. <lb/>The coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, and 𝑓 are determined from the following quantities, which only <lb/>depend on the data set: <lb/>• 𝑇: Top of the data scale. We used 𝑇 = 2 \] . <lb/>• 𝑊: Width of the data range in approximately linear scale in decades. We used 𝑊 = <lb/>0.74 as suggested in Moore and Parks (2012). <lb/>• 𝑀: Width of data range in approximately logarithmic scale in decades. We used 𝑀 = <lb/>4.5, as suggested in Moore and Parks (2012). <lb/>• 𝐴: Additional width of data range in negative scale. We used 𝐴 = 0, which reproduces <lb/>the standard logicle scale as introduced in Parks et al. (2006). <lb/>We employed a MATLAB implementation which determines the coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, and 𝑓 <lb/>directly from 𝑇, 𝑀, 𝑊, and 𝐴 according to Moore and Parks (2012). <lb/>Utilization of this scale is common practice for the visualization and statistical analysis of flow <lb/>cytometry data and is specifically useful for cases in which negative values appear after <lb/>background correction of the raw data and when a more accurate representation of the <lb/>distribution of intensities around zero is favorable. While the traditional logarithmic scaling of <lb/>the fluorescence intensities yields a clear data distribution for higher values, it cannot cope <lb/>with negative values and it tends to &apos;piling up&apos; of intensities on the lower end of the scale. By <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">construction, the logicle scale is able to combine the advantages of the logarithmic scale for <lb/>higher values with a linear-like scale for the lower end. <lb/>For each time point and Epo dose the mean of the logicle scale-transformed fluorescence <lb/>intensities was used as data point for the fitting of the population-average model. For the <lb/>quantitative immunoblotting, real-time PCR and mass spectrometry experiments the <lb/>measured intensities, which should correspond to the mean of the measured cell population, <lb/>were considered as data points. <lb/>Parameter estimation and profile likelihood <lb/>All calculations and analyses of the ODE system describing the pathway model were done <lb/>within the MATLAB-based modeling environment D2D (www.data2dynamics.org) (Raue et al, <lb/>2015). The ODEs were solved by a parallelized implementation of the CVODES initial value <lb/>problem solver (Hindmarsh et al, 2005). The ODE model was calibrated using maximum <lb/>likelihood estimation (Raue et al, 2015). We used the local deterministic Gauss-Newton <lb/>gradient-based trust-region optimizer implemented in the MATLAB function lsqnonlin which <lb/>is part of the MATLAB optimization toolbox. Multi-start optimization runs with in each case at <lb/>least 2500 initial guesses were performed using the afore-described model and dataset as <lb/>well as for each reduced model (see section &quot;Model reduction&quot;). To assess the uncertainty <lb/>and identifiability of the estimated parameters the profile likelihood (Raue et al, 2010; Raue et <lb/>al, 2009) was calculated using D2D. <lb/>Model reduction <lb/>Based on the comprehensive experimental data set and the original population-average <lb/>model topology, a systematic data-based model reduction was performed by iteratively <lb/>analyzing the profile likelihood (Hass et al, 2017; Maiwald et al, 2016; Tönsing et al, 2018). By <lb/>this, non-identifiabilities can be resolved without changing the dynamics of the observed <lb/>model entities. <lb/>First, we observed the inverse coupling of the non-identifiable parameters for the activation <lb/>rate of SHP1 by the active form of the EpoRJAK2 (EpoRpJAK2 and pEpoRpJAK2) complex <lb/>and the rate by which the pEpoRpJAK2 state is recycled to its deactivated form by activated <lb/>SHP1 (SHP1Act). This suggests a weak activation of SHP1. Analogously to scenario 3 in <lb/>Maiwald et al. (2016), the SHP1 activation is so weak that it merely changes the level of the <lb/>inactive SHP1 state, although the amount of active SHP1 is not negligible, as it mediates the <lb/>deactivation of the EpoRJAK2 receptor. As a result, the profile likelihood of the activation rate <lb/>is open to minus infinity on the log10 scale, i.e. to zero on the linear scale, while the SHP1Act <lb/>mediated deactivation rate compensates for this and its profile is open to infinity. We resolved <lb/>this non-identifiability by reparametrizing the SHP1 mediated deactivation rate with the <lb/></div>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">inverse of the SHP1 activation rate, which yields the new, practically identifiable parameter <lb/>DeaEpoRJAKActSHP1 and structural non-identifiability of the SHP1 activation rate. The latter <lb/>is resolved by fixing it to an arbitrary value, which in the end is equivalent to a constant SHP1 <lb/>state with fixed functional relation between SHP1 and its active form. <lb/>Secondly, we observed the non-identifiability of the CISmRNA turnover parameter <lb/>(CISRNATurn) with a profile likelihood open to infinity. This parameter is related to the <lb/>modeling of a transcriptional delay in the synthesis of CISmRNA via the linear chain trick <lb/>(MacDonald, 1976). We resolved this non-identifiability by iteratively reducing the chain length <lb/>from five to two. <lb/>Thridly, we observed that the SOCS3mRNA transcription process showed a similar behavior <lb/>in the SOCS3mRNA turnover parameter (SOCS3TurnRNA) and the corresponding delay <lb/>parameter (SOCS3RNADelay), as well as the SOCS3 translational process in the parameter <lb/>(SOCS3Turn). All three model parameters showed a practically non-identifiability with profile <lb/>likelihoods open to infinity. This implies that the measured data of SOCS3 mRNA and SOCS3 <lb/>protein can be described by the model without delay but a single step. This is consistent with <lb/>the experimental data for SOCS3 mRNA and SOCS3 protein, which do not indicate a delay. <lb/>As a consequence, the transcriptional delay, the transcriptional and the translational process <lb/>of the synthesis of SOCS3 were merged into one single reaction. <lb/>The three model reduction steps yielded a model with only two remaining practically non-<lb/>identifiable parameters: the rate of Epo receptor mediated STAT5 phosphorylation <lb/>(STAT5ActEpoR) and the parameter capturing the inhibition STAT5 phosphorylation by CIS <lb/>(CISInh). These parameters cannot be determined from the available experimental data, but <lb/>related studies showed the relevance of these processes (Gobert et al, 1996; Yoshimura et <lb/>al, 1995). To ensure biological plausibility of the model and because these non-identifiabilities <lb/>do not diminish the predictive power of the model&apos;s output, we did not perform an additional <lb/>model reduction step. <lb/>The different parameter and state eliminations provide a reduced model (see model equations <lb/>below) which captures the core features of the original model and is able to describe all <lb/>available population-average data. However, the identifiability of the remaining model <lb/>parameters improved considerably when compared to the model suggested from Bachmann <lb/>et al. (2011) and provides finite profile likelihood based confidence intervals at a confidence <lb/>level of 0.95 for 19 of the 21 dynamic parameters. At a confidence level of 0.68, all dynamic <lb/>parameters have finite profile likelihood-based confidence intervals. In addition, the described <lb/>model reduction resulted in a substantial improvement of optimizer performance and <lb/>convergence. On average 4.1 fits per hour converged to the global optimum for the reduced <lb/>model and the complete data set, whereas only 2.6 fits per hour converged to the global <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Mixed-effect modeling for cell population <lb/>In this study we account for cell-to-cell variability be allowing the protein abundances and <lb/>parameters of individual cells to differ. This is a common approach to capture (slow) extrinsic <lb/>noise. As the abundance of most biochemical species involved in the process is rather high, <lb/>we assume that the influence of intrinsic noise (stochasticity of cellular processes causes <lb/>differences) is minimal. Mathematically, considering differences between the parameters of <lb/>individual cells yield a mixed-effect model of the process. As we propagate this model through <lb/>an ODE -providing a non-linear map from parameters to outputs -, we obtain a nonlinear <lb/>mixed-effect model (NLMEM). <lb/>To simulate the NLMEM, we create an in-silico population of cells, in which each single-cell <lb/>has its own parameter vector. The parameter vector 𝜙 y for the i-th cell is given as <lb/>𝜙 y = 𝐹𝛽 + 𝑅𝑏 y , <lb/>in which 𝐹 and 𝑅 are called design matrices for fixed and random effects, 𝛽 ∈ 𝑅 z ‹ is the <lb/>vector of fixed effects (i.e., the parameter set describing the population mean), 𝑏 y ∈ 𝑅 z OE is the <lb/>vector of random effects for the i-th cell. The fixed effects 𝛽 influence the parameters of all <lb/>cells, while the random effects 𝑏 y are specific to one single-cell. We assume the random <lb/>effects to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix 𝛴, 𝑏 y ∼ <lb/>𝑁(0, 𝛴). The covariance matrix 𝛴 is parameterized by a vector 𝛿, yielding the parameter vector <lb/>𝜃 = (𝛽, 𝛿) , which describes the population dynamics. Hence, the parameter estimation <lb/>problem of the population average model (where only 𝛽 has to be inferred) is extended for the <lb/>mixed effect model by the parameters of the population distribution which are grouped in 𝛿. <lb/>The term &quot;NLMEM&quot; is typically used when analyzing single-cell time-lapse data (Karlsson et <lb/>al, 2015), however, many of the models used for single-cell snapshot data are also NLMEM <lb/>(Loos et al, 2018). As the cells from different time points in a time series of flow cytometry <lb/>data are not the same and are hence not directly comparable, we did not fit single-cell <lb/>trajectories to the whole dataset. Instead, we simulated a heterogeneous population, <lb/>propagated it through the ODE and fitted the shapes of the simulated distributions of certain <lb/>protein abundances to the snapshots. As a measure of the shape of these distributions, we <lb/>used means, variances and covariances. <lb/>In more detail, this means that for a population with 𝑀 individuals, we simulated 𝑀 trajectories <lb/>of state variables <lb/>𝑥 y (𝑡) = ∫ { &quot; <lb/>{ 𝑓;𝑠, 𝑥;𝑠, 𝜙 y C, 𝜙 y C𝑑𝑠 <lb/>for each random effect vector 𝑏 y , where 𝑓 is the vector field of the considered ODE model: <lb/>𝑥 <lb/>• y (𝑡) = 𝑓;𝑡, 𝑥 y (𝑡), 𝜙 y C with 𝑥 y (𝑡 -) = 𝑥 -;𝜙 y C. This yielded 𝑀 trajectories of observables <lb/>𝑦 y (𝑡) = ℎ;𝑥 y (𝑡), 𝜙 y C <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">from which the means, variances and the covariances (and possibly higher moments) can be <lb/>computed and fitted to measurement data. <lb/>Approximations to simulate cell populations <lb/>Monte Carlo sampling <lb/>The simplest way to approximate the means, variances and the covariances is to directly <lb/>simulate a cell population using parameters obtained from Monte Carlo sampling. For each <lb/>individual cell 𝒊 ∈ 𝟏, … , 𝑴, the random effect vector 𝒃 𝒊 is given by <lb/>𝒃 𝒊,𝑺𝒂𝒎𝒑 = 𝝍 𝑺𝒂𝒎𝒑 (𝒊, 𝑴, 𝜮): = 𝑳𝜺 𝒊 , <lb/>in which 𝑳 is the lower factor of the Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrix 𝜮 and 𝜺 𝒊 is <lb/>th 𝒊-th sample from a set of 𝑴 standard normally distributed points in 𝑹 𝒏 . Outputs like mean <lb/>and covariance of observables are obtained from the outputs of each sample. <lb/>The size 𝑴 of the sampled population must be large enough to reflect the behavior of the <lb/>distribution function. For this purpose, sample sizes of e.g. 10 000 simulated cells are <lb/>common, which means that the computation time necessary for model parametrization must <lb/>be multiplied with the size of the cell population. While this may be feasible for analytic or very <lb/>simple ODE models, it is computationally intractable for the model considered in this work, <lb/>since this would result in millions of hours of computation time. However, simulating a full <lb/>population of cells represents the most faithful method for describing the actual biological <lb/>system. Hence, we compared the final simulation results obtained from other approximation <lb/>methods regularly to simulation results obtained using Monte Carlo sampling. <lb/>Sigma point methods <lb/>The sigma point approach (Van Der Merwe, 2004) is one of the computationally most efficient <lb/>methods to approximate a population of cells. Given 𝒏 𝒃 random effects, we need to compute <lb/>𝟐𝒏 𝒃 + 𝟏 (sigma) points and propagate them through the ODE. These points are usually <lb/>located at 0 and ±𝒉 along the parameter axes in each random effect direction, where 𝒉 is a <lb/>chosen step size, which is set to ¬𝟎. 𝟓 ⋅ 𝒏 𝒃 . If 𝜮 is the unit matrix, this will yield 𝒃 𝒊,𝑺𝑷 = 𝒉𝒆 𝒊 <lb/>with 𝒆 𝒊 being the 𝒊-th unit vector. In the general case, the sigma points get transformed with <lb/>the lower Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix: <lb/>𝒃 𝒊,𝑺𝑷 = 𝝍 𝑺𝑷 (𝒊, 𝑴, 𝜮): = 𝑳𝒉𝒆 𝒊 , for 𝒊 ∈ {𝟏, … , 𝒏 𝒃 }, <lb/>𝒃 𝒊,𝑺𝑷 = 𝝍 𝑺𝑷 (𝒊, 𝑴, 𝜮): = −𝑳𝒉𝒆 𝒊 , for 𝒊 ∈ {𝒏 𝒃 + 𝟏, … , 𝟐𝒏 𝒃 }, <lb/>and <lb/>𝒃 𝟎,𝑺𝑷 = 𝟎. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Additionally, the sigma points carry weights 𝒘 𝒎 <lb/>𝒊 , 𝒊 ∈ {𝟎, … , 𝟐𝒏 𝒃 } for the means and weights <lb/>𝒘 𝑪 <lb/>𝒊 , 𝒊 ∈ {𝟎, … , 𝟐𝒏 𝒃 } for the covariances. They are computed as: <lb/>𝒘 𝒎 <lb/>𝟎 = <lb/>𝝀 <lb/>𝝀 + 𝒏 𝒃 <lb/>𝒘 𝒎 <lb/>𝒊 = <lb/>𝟏 <lb/>𝟐(𝝀 ¶𝒏 𝒃 ) <lb/>, for 𝒊 &gt; 𝟎 <lb/>𝒘 𝑪 <lb/>𝟎 = <lb/>𝟐𝝀 + 𝒏 𝒃 <lb/>𝝀 + 𝒏 𝒃 <lb/>+ 𝒒 − 𝒂 𝟐 <lb/>𝒘 𝒎 <lb/>𝒊 = <lb/>𝟏 <lb/>𝟐(𝝀 ¶𝒏 𝒃 ) <lb/>, for 𝒊 &gt; 𝟎 <lb/>where we fixed 𝒂 = 𝟎. 𝟕 (it should hold: 𝟎 &lt; 𝒂 ≤ 𝟏), 𝒒 = 𝟐 (it should hold 𝒒 ≥ 𝟏) and 𝝀 = <lb/>𝒏 𝒃 (𝒂 𝟐 − 𝟏). These weights are then used to compute means, variances and covariances of <lb/>observables. <lb/>Dirac mixture models <lb/>The sigma point approximation may be computationally efficient, but it reflects the mean and <lb/>variance only for linear systems exactly. Therefore, it can be inaccurate for highly nonlinear <lb/>applications such as nonlinear ODE systems. Since in our case, massive Monte Carlo <lb/>sampling was computationally infeasible and sigma points approximations provided poor <lb/>results, we decided to use Dirac mixture distribution (DMD) approximations (Gilitschenski &amp; <lb/>Hanebeck, 2013). A DMD is a small set of points, which attempts to accurately reflect a <lb/>multivariate normal distribution by fulfilling an optimality condition on the approximation <lb/>quality. The number of these Dirac points can be freely chosen, in order to adapt the <lb/>approximation quality. Thus, a DMD can either be interpreted as a small, but optimal sample, <lb/>or as a sigma point method with adjustable accuracy. This allowed us to balance <lb/>computational effort and numerical accuracy with high flexibility. However, this has the <lb/>disadvantage that the DMD with the desired properties must be computed before it can be <lb/>used for parameter estimation. To do so, a multivariate standard normal distribution with the <lb/>desired dimension 𝒏 𝒃 is approximated by a mixture of 𝒏 𝑫 Dirac-delta distributions. We <lb/>decided to use 𝒏 𝑫 = 𝟒𝟐, since this yields 𝒏 𝑫 𝒏 𝒃 <lb/>⁄ = 𝟔, which are three times as many points <lb/>as in the case of the sigma point approximation, which has 𝒏 𝑫 = 𝟐𝒏 𝒃 + 𝟏. This guarantees <lb/>a substantially higher approximation accuracy than the sigma point approximation. <lb/>The DMD for the smaller models (𝒏 𝒃 = 𝟔 and 𝒏 𝒃 = 𝟒) were computed from the largest one <lb/>by integrating out the corresponding columns. In this way, we could make sure that the <lb/>calibrated models are really nested and can be analyzed with means such as the BIC. <lb/>Otherwise, slightly different approximation accuracies due to different numbers of mixture <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">points can dominate the parameter estimation results and may lead to incorrect conclusions <lb/>when applying model criteria such as the BIC. <lb/>In order to compute the locations of the 𝒏 𝑫 Dirac-points 𝒛 = ;𝒛 𝟏 , … , 𝒛 𝒏 𝑫 C ∈ 𝑹 𝒏 𝒃 ×𝒏 𝑫 , a <lb/>modified Cramér-von Mises-distance between distributions is defined based on a measure <lb/>called localized cumulative distribution (LCD) (Hanebeck &amp; Klumpp, 2008). The LCD is a <lb/>substitute for the cumulative distribution for multivariate probability density functions. For an <lb/>𝒏 𝒃 -dimensional probability density function 𝒇: 𝑹 𝒏 𝒃 ⟶ 𝑹 ¶ , the corresponding LCD is defined <lb/>as <lb/>𝑭 𝒇 (𝒎, 𝑩) = 𝒑 𝒇 Ç𝒙 𝒊 − 𝒎 ∨≤ <lb/>𝟏 <lb/>𝟐 <lb/>𝑩 𝒊 Ê <lb/>with 𝑩 ∈ 𝑹 𝒏 𝒃 , ¶ , 𝒎 ∈ 𝑹 𝒏 𝒃 , ¶ and 𝒑 𝒇 being the probability given the density function 𝒇.

This yields <lb/>𝛴 = 𝑈 ã 𝛬𝑈. <lb/>Since none of these methods led to satisfactory results, we designed a novel approach based <lb/>on Lie-theoretic considerations: We parametrized the eigenvalues logarithmically as diagonal <lb/>matrix <lb/>𝛬 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔 Ö𝑒𝑥𝑝;𝜆 \ , … , 𝜆 z OE C× <lb/>and defined <lb/>𝛴 = 𝑈 ã 𝛬𝑈 <lb/>with 𝑈 being a rotational matrix. However, we parametrized 𝑈 not directly, as done in the <lb/>Givens-formula, but indirectly, via the Lie algebra of the rotation group 𝑆𝑂(𝑛), i.e., we set <lb/>𝑈 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝐴), with = −𝐴 ã , <lb/>which we assume to have entries 𝐴 yae ∈ [−𝑏, 𝑏], with 𝑏 ≫ 1, where 𝑏 is an arbitrarily chosen <lb/>bound, for which we used 𝑏 = 20. Thus, we only need to parametrize the antisymmetric matrix <lb/>𝐴, which is a much simpler task than parametrizing the rotations. <lb/>This approach takes advantage of the fact that the exponential map is a local diffeomorphism <lb/>around the unit elements of the Lie group and the Lie algebra. Furthermore, 𝐴 = 0 being a <lb/>natural initial guess for the optimization problem, lies at the center of the parameter interval. <lb/>Compared to the Givens parametrization, this has the advantage of reducing the dependence <lb/>of the 𝜑 y on each other and hence improving the optimizer convergence. <lb/></div>

The BIC accounts for the <lb/>maximum log-likelihood of each model (as a measure for fit quality) and model complexity. <lb/>The BIC is computed as follows: <lb/>𝐵𝐼𝐶(𝑀) = −2𝑙;𝜃 ì <lb/>ìíî C + 𝑛 ï ð 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛 P ), <lb/>where 𝑀 is the model, 𝑙 log-posterior (or the log-likelihood) with the maximum a posteriori (or <lb/>maximum likelihood) estimate 𝜃 ìíî , 𝑛 ï ð is the number of parameters of 𝑀 and 𝑛 P is the <lb/>number of data points. Especially for models with many data points (like in our case), the BIC <lb/>penalizes model complexity stronger than the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and may <lb/>hence give stronger indications for model selection. <lb/>Translocation rates and compartmental volumes <lb/>Our single-cell model selection reveals the import and export rates to be variable, and it <lb/>predicts the heterogeneity of the import rates to be higher than the heterogeneity of the export <lb/>rates (Figure 6A): In order to quantify this difference more precisely, we used the estimated <lb/>decadic translocation rate constants 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 óãíãô and 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 óãíãô and the estimated <lb/>covariance matrix of random effects 𝛴 for the simulation of 1000 cell population with 100 000 <lb/>cells each.

We confirmed the first relation by simulating 10 000 random walks in three <lb/>dimensions with for different nucleic radii (Figure 6C). In such a random walk, which we always <lb/>started in the center of the nucleus, a molecule could move along each coordinate axis either <lb/>forward or backward with a fixed step size until it reached the boundary of the nucleic sphere. <lb/>The mean of the computation times of these walks was computed and used as a <lb/>proxy for the expected export time of a STAT5 molecule.

The <lb/>necessary thresholds for the respective survival signals were fitted to the survival data based <lb/>on the selected single-cell model at the optimal parameter value.
