			<front>A complete bacterial genome assembled de novo using <lb/>only nanopore sequencing data <lb/>Nicholas J. Loman 1 , Joshua Quick 1 &amp; Jared T. Simpson 2 <lb/>1 Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK <lb/>2 Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada <lb/> A method for de novo assembly of data from the Oxford Nanopore MinION instrument is pre-<lb/>sented which is able to reconstruct the sequence of an entire bacterial chromosome in a single <lb/>contig. Initially, overlaps between nanopore reads are detected. Reads are then subjected to <lb/>one or more rounds of error correction by a multiple alignment process employing partial <lb/>order graphs. After correction, reads are assembled using the Celera assembler. We show <lb/>that this method is able to assemble nanopore reads from Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 into <lb/>a single contig of length 4.6Mb permitting a full reconstruction of gene order. The resulting <lb/>assembly has 98.4% nucleotide identity compared to the finished reference genome. <lb/></front>

			<body>The Oxford Nanopore MinION is a portable, single molecule genome sequencing instrument <lb/>no larger than a typical smartphone. As this instrument directly senses native, individual DNA <lb/>fragments without the need for amplification, it is able to sequence extremely long fragments (&gt;10 <lb/>kilobases) of DNA without a reduction in sequence quality 1 . <lb/>The availability of very long reads is important when assembling genomes as they span <lb/>repetitive elements and anchor repeat copies within uniquely occurring parts of the genome. Many <lb/></body>

			<body>bacterial genomes can be assembled into single contigs if reads greater than eight kilobases are <lb/>available, as these reads span the conserved ribosomal RNA operon which is typically the longest <lb/>repeat sequence in a bacterial genome 2 . <lb/>The accuracy of the sequence reads is another potentially limiting step for genome assem-<lb/>bly; at launch, data from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing instrument was hard to use for de <lb/>novo assembly due to the lack of bioinformatics tools designed for long reads with a high error <lb/>rate. Several algorithmic improvements have led to this platform becoming the gold standard for <lb/>genome assembly; Koren et al. demonstrated that hybrid techniques could generate contiguous <lb/>assemblies 3 . This method uses accurate short-read data, or Pacific Biosciences circular consensus <lb/>reads, to correct error-prone long reads sufficiently for assembly 4 . Non-hybrid de novo assemblies <lb/>of PacBio data in absence of short-read data remained an open problem until Chin et al. developed <lb/>the HGAP (Hierarchical Genome-Assembly Process) assembler 5 . HGAP typically uses a subset <lb/>of the longest reads in the sequencing data set to use as the input for the assembly process. This <lb/>subset of long reads is corrected using the entire data set, and this corrected set of reads is assem-<lb/>bled with the Celera Assembler. The final assembly is &apos;polished&apos; using a signal-level consensus <lb/>algorithm to high accuracy. This assembly strategy has revolutionized genome assembly of small <lb/>genomes and is now being applied to large genomes 6, 7 . <lb/>Nanopore sequencing data has clear similarities to Pacific Biosciences data, with reads suf-<lb/>ficiently long to be of great use in de novo assembly 7, 8 . Recently, a hybrid approach to assembly <lb/>which used Illumina short reads to correct nanopore reads prior to assembly was shown to give <lb/></body>

			<body>good results a bacterial and a yeast genome 9 . However, non-hybrid assemblies have not yet been <lb/>described. Recent versions of nanopore chemistry (R7.3) coupled with the latest base caller (Met-<lb/>richor ≥ 1.9) permits read-level accuracies of between 78-85% 1, 8 . While this is slightly lower <lb/>than the latest version of Pacific Biosciences chemistry 6 , we hypothesised that a similar assembly <lb/>approach where nanopore data reads are self-corrected may result in highly contiguous assemblies. <lb/>Overlaps can be detected more easily with higher accuracy data. Therefore for this study we <lb/>exclusively used high-quality &quot;passing filter&quot; two-direction (2D) reads. DNA strands which have <lb/>been read in both directions by the MinION and combined during base-calling are higher quality <lb/>than the individual template and complement strands 8 . All 2D reads from four separate MinION <lb/>runs using R7.3 chemistry were combined. Each run was made using a freshly prepared sequencing <lb/>library using library protocol SQK-MAP-003 (first run) or SQK-MAP-004 (three further runs). In <lb/>total, 22,270 2D reads were used comprising 133.6Mb of read data, representing ˜29x theoretical <lb/>coverage of the 4.6 megabase E. coli K-12 MG1655 reference genome (Supplementary Table 1). <lb/>The FASTA sequences for reads were extracted using poretools 10 . Potential overlaps <lb/>between the reads were detected using the DALIGNER software 11 . Each read and the reads it <lb/>overlaps were used as input to the partial order aligner (POA) software 12 . POA uses a directed <lb/>acyclic graph to compute a multiple alignment, which we use to determine a consensus sequence. <lb/>The use of partial order graphs permits a more sensitive reconstruction of consensus sequences <lb/>in the presence of large numbers of insertions or deletions. This step is analogous to the pre-<lb/>correction step of the HGAP pipeline, which also uses partial order graphs (implemented in the <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>pbdagcon software) to compute a consensus sequence. We run this correction process multiple <lb/>times, using the corrected reads as the new input. The results of this correction process increased <lb/>the mean percentage identity from 80.5% to 95.9% after the first iteration and 97.7% on the second <lb/>iteration (Supplementary Figure 1). <lb/>The reads resulting from two rounds of correction were used as input to version 8.2 of the <lb/>Celera Assembler 13 . The Celera Assembler was run with settings specified in Supplementary <lb/>Figure 4. The critical parameter for tuning is the overlap minimum identity, which should be <lb/>double the raw read error rate, in this case set to 6% (ovlMinIdentity=0.06). This resulted <lb/>in a highly contiguous assembly with four contigs, the largest being of length 4.6Mb and covering <lb/>the entire E. coli chromosome (Figure 1). The other three contigs were small (6-15kb) and their <lb/>sequences were present in the long contig and so we did not include them in further analysis. <lb/>The final assembly has 3,949 mismatches (85 per 100kb) and 47,395 indels of ≥1 base (1021 <lb/>errors per 100kb), as determined by the QUAST validation tool when compared to the E. coli K-12 <lb/>MG1655 reference genome (NC 000913.3) 14 . <lb/>QUAST reported two misassemblies with respect to the reference sequence. On visual in-<lb/>spection of an alignment generated by the Mauve software we determined one large (&gt;500 base) <lb/>region of difference between our assembly and the reference. This represented an insertion of a <lb/>transposase-encoding region into our assembly. This sequence (approximately 750 bases long) is <lb/>present nine times in the reference genome. Insertion events involving transposons are common in <lb/>bacterial genomes and can affect wild-type strains commonly used in laboratory experiments, but <lb/></body>

			<body>are difficult to detect using draft assemblies from short-read sequencing technologies. <lb/>We explored the sequence context of errors in our assembly by comparing 5-mer counts <lb/>in our assembled sequence and the reference genome. While most 5-mers are equally well-<lb/>represented in our assembly and the reference, we found a significant under-representation of <lb/>poly-nucleotide tracts in our assembly (Figure 4). As the MinION relies on a change in elec-<lb/>tric current to detect base-to-base transitions, which may not occur or may not be detectable as <lb/>locally repetitive sequence transits the pore, this error mode is expected. We anticipate that the <lb/>error profile of our assembly may be improved through an additional assembly &apos;polishing&apos; stage <lb/>employing signal-level information from the raw reads. <lb/>We conclude that long read data from the Oxford Nanopore MinION can be used to assemble <lb/>complete bacterial genomes to give an accurate view of gene order and synteny, without the need <lb/>for complementary sequencing technologies. Further improvements in modeling sequence errors <lb/>from this platform will be required to improve the base accuracy of the assembly. We have not <lb/>evaluated the impact of greater sequencing coverage on accuracy, but this may result in further <lb/>improvements. The software pipeline used to generate these assemblies is freely available online <lb/>at https://github.com/jts/nanocorrect. <lb/></body>
