			<front>Abstract: <lb/>Urodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and <lb/>develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects. However, in <lb/>animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder <lb/>pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research <lb/>confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, <lb/>propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder <lb/>compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart <lb/>rate [∆HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated <lb/>cystometrograms across five adult male cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder <lb/>capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-<lb/>chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the <lb/>initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane <lb/>of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared <lb/>to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery <lb/>was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and <lb/>anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices. <lb/>Key words: anesthesia, bladder, cats, urodynamics <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Urodynamic studies such as cystometrograms (CMGs) are used to study bladder function, <lb/>diagnose bladder disease, and even develop treatments for bladder dysfunctions. Ideally, the <lb/>subject should be awake and unanaesthetized during these studies 1 . However anesthesia, <lb/>which can confound urodynamic outcomes 2-4 , is often required in many animal models of <lb/>urodynamic studies, particularly when treatments for bladder dysfunctions are being tested in <lb/>experimental paradigms that require control over the animal&apos;s state. <lb/>Cats are a common animal model for spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology. <lb/>Despite their relatively small body size, their spinal cord is of similar length and anatomy to the <lb/>human spinal cord 5-7 . Urodynamic studies in awake cats are challenging. Placement of <lb/>indwelling bladder catheters for awake studies is invasive, and can lead to complications such <lb/>as cystitis. Temporary catheter placement for urodynamic trials necessitates the administration <lb/>of anesthetic agents 8 that interfere with autonomic reflexes to varying degrees 9,10 . Agents <lb/>minimally inhibitory towards autonomic reflexes such as α-chloralose or urethane, are not <lb/>recommended for survival procedures due to concerns of prolonged recovery or carcinogenicity <lb/>11 <lb/>. <lb/>While current literature has shown differences in CMG parameters such bladder capacity, <lb/>peak pressure, and non-voiding contractions (NVCs) based on different anesthetic agents, <lb/>studies are limited especially in cats. To our knowledge, no studies have characterized the <lb/>following agents used in clinical veterinary medicine for cats on CMG parameters: 1) alfaxalone, <lb/>2) dexmedetomidine, and 3) propofol (without the use of another anesthetic). <lb/>Dexmedetomidine is commonly used as a sedative-anesthetic in veterinary medicine (and to <lb/>facilitate CMG testing in our laboratory 12 ), due to its ease of administration (intramuscular [IM], <lb/>and rapid recovery through the reversal agent atipamezole). However, in a rat study, <lb/>dexmedetomidine was inhibitory to the volume evoked micturition reflex and peak pressure <lb/>compared to urethane and awake trials 13 . Propofol, an anesthetic agent used to facilitate CMG <lb/>testing in clinical veterinary medicine 14,15 , has not been compared directly to dexmedetomidine <lb/>in cat trials, but is suspected to be less inhibitory than dexmedetomidine due to its mechanism <lb/>of action (propofol has no analgesic properties, while dexmedetomidine does) and ability to <lb/>carefully titrate anesthetic depth through intravenous [IV] infusion. Unfortunately, propofol can <lb/></body>

			<body>only be given IV, so it often requires another agent to secure IV access. Alfaxalone, recently <lb/>approved in the United States for use in cats, has a similar mechanism of action and clinical <lb/>application as propofol, but has not been used in cats in the context of urodynamic studies. <lb/>Unlike propofol, alfaxalone is formulated for IM dosing and does not require an additional agent <lb/>16 <lb/>. <lb/>In this study we anesthetized male cats with alfaxalone, dexmedetomidine, and propofol at <lb/>the lowest anesthetic doses practical to facilitate CMG testing prior to terminal procedures that <lb/>used isoflurane and α-chloralose. We assessed the effect of anesthetic agent on CMG and <lb/>anesthetic parameters, hypothesizing that some anesthetic agents would be more inhibitory <lb/>towards bladder function than others. Vascular access ports (VAPs) were placed prior to trials, <lb/>to ensure propofol could be studied independently without the need for another agent. <lb/>Results <lb/>Five cats were anesthetized at least 3 times with each agent (Supplementary Table S1). At <lb/>least 2 CMG trials were conducted per session. We only collected terminal (isoflurane and α-<lb/>chloralose) trials from four of five cats due to one unexpected death. <lb/>Cystometrogram Parameters <lb/>Bladder capacity differed significantly between agents (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S2, <lb/>Supplementary Table S3). Bladder capacity was greatest with α-chloralose (59.6 ± 9.2 ml), and <lb/>significantly increased compared to alfaxalone (46.7 ± 8.6 ml, p = 0.02), dexmedetomidine (42.9 <lb/>± 8.6 ml, p &lt; 0.001), and propofol (44.2 ± 8.6 ml, p = 0.003). Bladder capacity under isoflurane <lb/>(54.5 ± 9.1 ml) was significantly increased compared to dexmedetomidine (p = 0.03). <lb/>Additionally, Δpressure also differed significantly between agents (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table <lb/>S2, Supplementary Table S3. Trials under propofol had the greatest Δpressure (116.5 ± 9.6 cm <lb/>H20), and were significantly increased compared to isoflurane (84.2 ± 13.1 cm H20, p = 0.04) <lb/>(Fig. 1b). Compliance did not differ significantly between agents (p &gt; 0.05 for all pairwise <lb/>comparisons, Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Table S3). <lb/>Non-voiding contraction rate was highest with α-chloralose (0.033 ± 0.004 NVCs/s) and <lb/>significantly higher than all other agents (p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons; Fig. 1c, Supplementary <lb/>Table S2, SupplementaryTable S3). Alfaxalone (0.012 ± 0.003 NVCs/s) had the second highest <lb/>rate of NVCs, and was significantly greater than dexmedetomidine which had the lowest rate of <lb/>NVCs (0.002 ± 0.003 NVCs/s, p = 0.008). The amplitude of non-voiding contractions was not <lb/>different between agents (p &gt; 0.05). <lb/>The trends of the CMG bladder pressure responses changed with agent, with different <lb/>agents having variable periods of passive filling compared to active contraction over the trial. <lb/>Notably, propofol CMG responses were characterized by an early and gradual rise (longer <lb/>period of active contraction), compared to dexmedetomidine responses which were <lb/>characterized by a long period of low pressure (passive contraction) and a rapid rise <lb/>immediately before voiding (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S2). The bladder pressure trends for <lb/>other agents fell between the propofol and dexmedetomidine extremes. This was further <lb/>described through quantification of slopes at select time points (Fig. 2b). During slope 1 (start to <lb/>100 seconds before void), propofol (0.06 ± 0.01 cm H20/s) was significantly increased compared <lb/>to alfaxalone (0.03 ± 0.01 cm H20/s, p &lt; 0.0001) and dexmedetomidine (0.02 ± 0.01 cm H20/s, <lb/>p &lt; 0.001). During slope 2 (100s before void to 50s before void), α-chloralose had the highest <lb/>slope (0.51 ± 0.08 cm H20/s), significantly higher than dexmedetomidine (0.17 ± 0.05 cm H20/s, <lb/>p = 0.001) and alfaxalone (0.27 ± 0.05 cm H20/s, p = 0.03). During slope 3 (50s before void to <lb/>void event) dexmedetomidine (1.45 ± 0.11 cm H20/s) was significantly greater than all other <lb/>agents: alfaxalone (1.10 ± 0.11 cm H20/s p = 0.009), α -chloralose (0.63 ± 0.18 cm H20/s, p &lt; <lb/></body>

Mean HR, compared across all five agents, was highest <lb/>under alfaxalone (215.16 ± 5.69 bmp), and significantly greater than all other agents: α-<lb/>chloralose (163.29 ± 9.49 bmp, p &lt; 0.001), dexmedetomidine (110.66 ± 5.75, p &lt; 0.001), <lb/>isoflurane (130.73 ± 8.18 bmp, p &lt; 0.001), and propofol (176.72 ± 5.81 bmp, p &lt; 0.001). All <lb/>other agents fell in between the two extremes. Mean change in heart rate (ΔHR), compared <lb/>across only non-terminal agents, was lowest with dexmedetomidine (13.79 ± 6.80 bmp), and <lb/>significantly different from propofol (37.50 ± 7.05 bmp, p = 0.0082) and alfaxalone (45.36 ± 6.65 <lb/>bmp, p &lt; 0.001). Mean ΔHR did not differ significantly between propofol and alfaxalone (p = <lb/>0.76). Two trials (both propofol) were excluded from the averaged continuous HR plot (Fig. 3a) <lb/>due to suspect artifacts. <lb/>Time to lateral recumbency and time to head up and walking differed significantly between <lb/>the non-terminal agents (Supplementary Table S5, Supplemental Table S6). The time to lateral <lb/>recumbency was shortest under propofol due to IV administration (2.42 ± 1.62 minutes), and <lb/>significantly shorter than alfaxalone (9.49 ± 1.49 minutes, p = 0.009). The time to head up and <lb/>walking were shortest under dexmedetomidine (1.73 ± 6.07, 2.53 ± 10.58 minutes) due to use of <lb/>the reversal agent atipamezole compared to alfaxalone (37.24 ± 6.10 [p &lt; 0.001], 55.26 ± 10.64 <lb/>[p &lt; 0.001] minutes) and propofol (43.22 ± 6.28 [p &lt; 0.001], 73.70 ± 10.64 [p &lt; 0.001] minutes) <lb/>(Fig. 3c). In general, reflexes showed greater anesthetic depth under dexmedetomidine <lb/>compared to alfaxalone and propofol, although jaw tone was tighter under dexmedetomidine <lb/>(Fig. 4). <lb/>Adverse Consequences <lb/>Adverse consequences associated with VAP placement included surgical dehiscence (1/5), <lb/>and port failure (1/5). In the cat with port failure, the last propofol trial was performed through <lb/>isoflurane induction, in order to facilitate IV catheter placement. Dexmedetomidine caused <lb/>vomiting immediately after injection in 7/15 (46.7%) of sessions. Cats did not vomit under other <lb/>agents. Each cat vomited at least once under dexmedetomidine. One cat had an independent <lb/>incidence of lethargy and vomiting unassociated with an anesthetic event, and was diagnosed <lb/>with disseminated lymphoma at necropsy. One cat displayed significant bradycardia with 2 nd <lb/>degree atrioventricular (AV) block arrhythmia under dexmedetomidine in 2 separate <lb/>anesthetized events. Echocardiogram and subsequent necropsy of this cat suggested evidence <lb/>of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and myofibril degeneration and atrophy. Finally, 1/13 <lb/>(7.7%) alfaxalone trials resulted in unexpected death. During recovery, after the CRI had been <lb/>discontinued, one cat became apneic and was not able to be resuscitated. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study we demonstrated differences in urodynamic parameters and anesthetic depth <lb/>at minimal doses needed to perform CMG testing in male cats. To our knowledge, this was the <lb/>first study to examine CMG parameters under alfaxalone, propofol in isolation without another <lb/>agent, or dexmedetomidine in comparison to the other agents used here. Our study <lb/>incorporates a novel method of CMG assessment (bladder pressure slopes) in conjunction with <lb/>traditional CMG parameters and careful evaluation of anesthetic depth. Together, our results <lb/>provide recommendations for anesthetic choice based on study parameters of interest and <lb/>logistic feasibility for CMG studies in male cats. Due to cross-species commonalities in <lb/>response to anesthetic agents, select information from this study may be able to be guide <lb/></body>

			<body>preliminary anesthetic choice to other species, including humans. However, feasibility and effect <lb/>on urodynamic and anesthetic parameters should be confirmed for the species in question. <lb/>Bladder capacity increases due to inhibition of central nervous system reflexes under <lb/>anesthesia (post-operative urinary retention) 9 . In this study, the bladder increases seen under <lb/>terminal agents (isoflurane and α-chloralose) (Fig. 1a) were strongly correlated with prolonged <lb/>anesthesia (isoflurane [2-6 hours before CMG trials, 8-10 hours total], followed by α-chloralose <lb/>[12-22 hours before CMG trials]) and repeated bladder fills for other experimental objectives. <lb/>Although we did not see significant differences between survival agents, dexmedetomidine has <lb/>been reported to cause polyuria through blockage of arginine-vasopressin release 22,23 . <lb/>Maximum detrusor pressure [Pdet(max)] can also be used to assess bladder function 15 . We <lb/>reported Δpressure to account for any positioning differences between trials that may have <lb/>affected baseline pressures. Consistent with previous studies examining Pdet(max) 3,14 , we <lb/>found that Δpressure was higher with propofol, and lower with isoflurane (Fig. 1b). While this <lb/>may be attributed to the lighter plane of anesthesia under propofol (general anesthetics <lb/>depresses Pdet(max) in a dose-dependent manner 3,14 ), a human study showed that even under <lb/>comparable anesthetic depth, propofol showed less suppression of cortical somatosensory <lb/>evoked potentials compared to isoflurane 24 . Alternatively, the increase in Δpressure may be <lb/>related to loss of function and initiation of the voiding reflex under propofol, as evidenced by <lb/>bladder slopes drastically different from the awake state. While the results of propofol are <lb/>difficult to interpret, isoflurane should be avoided in studies where Pdet(max) or Δpressure is a <lb/>key parameter of interest. <lb/>Non-voiding contractions are phasic pressure increases seen during bladder filling 25 that <lb/>may be linked to sensations relating to bladder volume 26 . They are more likely and more <lb/>frequently occur with urinary bladder pathologies 25,27,28 . Consistent with our understanding that <lb/>α-chloralose maintains spinal reflexes relative to other anesthetic agents 2 , the greatest number <lb/>of NVCs were observed with α-chloralose (Fig. 1c). Alfaxalone trials had the next greatest <lb/>number of NVCs, and the most out of the non-terminal agents studied. Notably, <lb/>dexmedetomidine almost completely eliminated NVCs compared to other agents. The α2 <lb/>mediated analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine may block the sensation of bladder filling at <lb/>the spinal or supra-spinal level 16,29 . Clinically, dexmedetomidine has been used for analgesia <lb/>and prevention of post-operative catheter-related bladder discomfort 30 . However, awake CMG <lb/>trials have significantly less NVCs than anesthetized trials 12 , so absence of NVCs is not <lb/>necessarily pathological. When NVCs are desired (ex: overactive bladder models), α-chloralose <lb/>(non-survival) and alfaxalone (survival) can be considered, and dexmedetomidine should be <lb/>avoided. <lb/>In this study CMG bladder pressure slopes differed between agents (Fig. 2), interpreted as <lb/>previously described variable periods of passive filling and active contraction 31 . Pressure slopes <lb/>under dexmedetomidine (characterized by a flat filling period, followed by a sharp rise to the <lb/>void event) are most similar to awake animal cystometrograms 32,33 . In contrast, pressure slopes <lb/>under propofol had the most obvious change from the awake slope, characterized by an early <lb/>rapid rise and less obvious void event. Although there are no standardized criteria for defining <lb/>passive filling and active contraction, we found propofol consistently reached a higher <lb/>normalized pressure compared to dexmedetomidine across normalized time, with the most <lb/>obvious separation noted between 900 -950 normalized time, where the mean normalized <lb/>pressure ± standard deviation range of dexmedetomidine is distinctly separate from the <lb/>corresponding range for propofol (Fig. 2a). A previous rat study using a single anesthetic agent <lb/>(tiletamine-zolazepam) at varying doses found lighter anesthesia was associated with more <lb/>awake-like bladder curves 32 . However, our study found dexmedetomidine (deeper plane of <lb/>anesthesia) was associated with more awake-like bladder responses compared to GABA-ergic <lb/>agonists with a lighter plane of anesthesia. This discrepancy suggests that suppression of <lb/>bladder reflexes may not be directly correlated with others of anesthetic depth (anesthetic <lb/></body>

			<body>reflexes measured in this study, heart rate, ΔHR). The exact significance of bladder pressure <lb/>slopes is unclear, but we recommend further investigation of bladder pressure response trends <lb/>in future studies in association to anesthetic depth, pharmacokinetics, and preservation of spinal <lb/>reflexes, as well as potential bladder pathology. <lb/>In addition to affecting CMG and urodynamic parameters, each agent offers unique logistical <lb/>benefits and constraints. Dexmedetomidine (α2 agonist), conveniently administered through IM <lb/>boluses (CRI only recommended for analgesia, not for sedation or anesthesia 16 ) and rapidly <lb/>reversed through atipamazole, provides a convenient method of anesthetizing cats. Due to the <lb/>nature of IM bolus administration, depth of anesthesia and therefore bladder function can vary <lb/>as plasma levels of dexmedetomidine increase or decreases. Common adverse effects of <lb/>dexmedetomidine include bradycardia, arrhythmias (AV block), and vomiting 16 , all of which <lb/>were noticed in our experiments. <lb/>Propofol and alfaxalone (GABAA agonistics) are used clinically to both induce (IV) and <lb/>maintain (CRI or repeat IV bolus) anesthesia 11 . Maintenance of anesthesia using a CRI allows <lb/>for steady-state drug plasma levels and a more stable plane of anesthesia. While propofol is <lb/>limited to IV administration, alfaxalone can be given IM for single-agent anesthesia. Common <lb/>side effects of both propofol and alfaxalone are apnea, although one study showed alfaxalone <lb/>had less respiratory depression compared to propofol 34 . Unexpectedly, we experienced a death <lb/>during the recovery phase (most common time of anesthetic-related death 35 ) of one alfaxalone <lb/>trial. To our knowledge, this was an isolated incident and not representative of the general <lb/>safety of alfaxalone. <lb/>In this study, we were able to decease concentrations of GABA-ergic agonists below <lb/>recommended labelled dosing in part due to the stable plane of anesthesia associated with CRI <lb/>administration. This could be one explanation for the lighter plane of anesthesia (more <lb/>preserved reflexes, higher average heart rate, and greater change in heart rate over trial) <lb/>observed in GABA-ergic agonistics compared to dexmedetomidine (Figs. 3 and 4). However, <lb/>another concurrent explanation for increased heart rate under the GABA-ergic agonists is <lb/>hypotension with reflex tachycardia 36 . This is in contrast with dexmedetomidine, which causes <lb/>vasoconstriction, leading to hypertension and reflex bradycardia 16 . Consistent with previous <lb/>studies in dogs showing alfaxalone causes less cardiovascular depression than propofol 36 , we <lb/>observed the mean heart rate under alfaxalone (at or slightly above the upper limit of awake <lb/>reference range 37 ) was significantly higher than under propofol (Fig. 3). <lb/>Isoflurane (exact mechanism of action unknown 16,38 , but suspected to affect GABA <lb/>receptors 39 ) is the primary inhalant anesthetic used in veterinary medicine, especially in <lb/>prolonged invasive procedures 16 . <lb/>Although in this study it was only used during terminal procedures, in clinical veterinary <lb/>medicine isoflurane is commonly used during recovery procedures. Its inhaled route of <lb/>administration allows dosing to be easily titratable to adjust the depth of anesthesia. However, <lb/>inhaled agents are logistically more challenging, either requiring technical expertise to intubate <lb/>the animal, or risking personnel exposure. Since recovery from isoflurane is rapid, and <lb/>isoflurane has been previously used to facilitate propofol administration for urodynamic <lb/>procedures 40 , the effects of isoflurane on subsequent α-chloralose and propofol trials in this <lb/>study are assumed to be minimal. <lb/>The non-survival hypnotic α-chloralose (mechanism unknown) provides light long-lasting <lb/>anesthesia with minimal analgesia, and minimal effect on normal spinal and sympathetic reflex <lb/>function 2,11 . Unfortunately, α-chloralose is not recommended for survival studies due to <lb/>involuntary excitement and prolonged recovery 11 although several studies have successfully <lb/>recovered animals following α-chloralose anesthesia 41,42 . <lb/>Limitations of this study include the following: 1) lack of direct comparison to awake CMG <lb/>trials, 2) inability for full randomization due to logistical constraints (drug availability, ability to <lb/>secure IV access, etc), although effort was made to spread out agents, so that each agent was <lb/></body>

These animals were available from other <lb/>study, and the cohort size is similar to other relevant studies 3,14,17 . Animals were group housed <lb/>in a temperature (72 ± 2 °F) and humidity (30 -70%) controlled room on a 12:12 hour light/dark <lb/>cycle with ad libitum access to water and fed a complete diet for adult cats (Purina One Urinary <lb/>Tract Health Formula and Purina ProPlan EN, Nestle Purina, Neenah, WI). Cats were free of <lb/>feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, panleukopenia, coronavirus, feline immunodeficiency virus, <lb/>chlamydia, and toxoplasmosis. All experimental procedures were performed at an AAALAC <lb/>accredited institution, according to the standards established by the Guide for the Care and Use <lb/>of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal <lb/>Care and Use Committee. <lb/>Vascular Access Port <lb/>Each cat was implanted with a VAP (ClearPort Mid VAPs 5Fr with a rounded tip, 24&quot; <lb/>catheter; Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) to guarantee immediate IV access. IV access was <lb/>essential for avoiding a second agent in propofol experiments, and useful in providing a <lb/>constant rate infusion (CRI) in the alfaxalone and propofol experiments to maintain anesthesia. <lb/>Cats were induced with dexmedetomidine (0.02 mg/kg, Dexmedseed, Dechra, Overland Park, <lb/>KS), ketamine (6.6 mg/kg, Zetamine, Vet One, Boise, ID), and butorphanol (0.66 mg/kg, <lb/>Torbugesic, Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI), and maintained on isoflurane (0-2.5 %, Fluriso, Vet One, <lb/>Boise, ID). Incisions were made on the left ventral neck and dorsal neck or back. A catheter was <lb/>inserted and secured in the left jugular vein, and tunneled to a subcutaneous port secured to the <lb/>muscle between the shoulder blades 18,19 .

			<body>3 trials, and once within the final 3 trials), but full randomization could not be achieved due to <lb/>logistical constraints (agent availability, repeat trials, etc.). Each session was on a different day, <lb/>at least 2 days after the previous anesthetized session. <lb/>During terminal procedures in conjunction with other studies, cats were anesthetized with <lb/>the same dexmedetomidine/ketamine/butorphanol combination as for the VAP surgery, and <lb/>transitioned to isoflurane, then α-chloralose (70 mg/kg induction, 20 mg/kg maintenance every <lb/>4-6 hours or as needed [MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA]), supplemented with 0.01 mg/kg <lb/>buprenorphine 20 . <lb/>Cystometrograms <lb/>At least two CMG trials were conducted in each session. Warmed saline (41 °C) was <lb/>pumped at 2 mL/min (AS50 infusion pump, Baxter, Deerfield, IL; or PHD 2000, Harvard <lb/>Apparatus, Holliston, MA) through a fluid warmer (Hotline Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical, <lb/>Minneapolis, MN) and one lumen of a dual-lumen urethra catheter (Umbili-Cath™ 3.5 Fr <lb/>Polyurethane UVC Catheter, Utah Medical, Midvale, UT) into the urinary bladder. For non-<lb/>terminal sessions, sterile preparation of the perineal region and catheter was performed to <lb/>mitigate against infection. The other lumen of the catheter was connected to a pressure <lb/>transducer (V6402 pressure transducer, Smiths Medical, Minneapolis, MN) and Labchart <lb/>Colorado Springs, CO) for recording. At bladder capacity a void event occurred <lb/>and urine would leak around the catheter into a collecting tray (Fig. 5). The bladder was emptied <lb/>and a break of at least 10 minutes was given between trials to allow the bladder to relax. <lb/>Bladder capacity was calculated as the maximum of the total volume infused or the sum of urine <lb/>collected from bladder and collecting tray. The variables analyzed for each CMG were bladder <lb/>capacity, change in pressure from baseline to maximum (Δpressure), compliance <lb/>(capacity/Δpressure), number and amplitude of non-voiding contractions (NVCs), and slopes of <lb/>the bladder pressure (&quot;pressure slopes&quot;) over three intervals as defined below. <lb/>Anesthetic Parameters <lb/>The time to lateral recumbency after initial agent injection and times to head up and walking <lb/>(ten consecutive steps without falling) were recorded for each anesthetic session with non-<lb/>terminal agents. During each session, vitals (heart rate [electrocardiogram or pulse oximetry], <lb/>O2 hemoglobin saturation (pulse oximetry; tongue, lip, or ear), non-invasive blood pressure <lb/>[forelimb] and temperature [rectal]) were monitored once every 15 minutes using a vitals monitor <lb/>(Surgivet, Smiths Medical, Minneapolis, MN). Respiratory rate was taken manually. The <lb/>average heart rate (mean HR) for a trial appeared to be a consistent indicator of anesthetic <lb/>plane and was later included in statistical analysis. Other vitals either did not fluctuate across <lb/>sessions or were subject to artifact and were not analyzed across sessions. During procedures <lb/>for three of the five cats, a data logger was used for continuous vitals recording once per <lb/>second and the calculation of change in heart rate over trial (ΔHR) in non-terminal studies. <lb/>Reflexes (palpebral, withdrawal, jaw tone, pupil dilation) were checked before each CMG trial. <lb/>Palpebral and withdrawal reflexes were categorized as &quot;yes (strong withdrawal)&quot;, &quot;some (weak <lb/>withdrawal)&quot; or &quot;no (no withdrawal)&quot;. Jaw tone was categorized as &quot;tight,&quot; &quot;mid&quot; (intermediate), <lb/>or &quot;loose.&quot; Pupil dilation was categorized as &quot;constricted,&quot; &quot;mid&quot; (intermediate), or &quot;dilated.&quot; In <lb/>general, as anesthetic depth increases, palpebral and withdrawal reflexes decrease, jaw tone <lb/>loosens, and pupils become more dilated 21 . <lb/>Data Acquisition and Analysis: <lb/>Bladder pressure data was processed using MATLAB (R2019a, MathWorks, Natick, MA) <lb/>and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Bladder pressure was smoothed using a 1 second <lb/>moving average. NVCs were identified in MATLAB using the findpeaks function, defining a peak <lb/>as at least 3 cm H2O, at least 0.5 seconds away from another peak, and then manually <lb/></body>

			<body>confirmed. To account for the range of trial lengths, NVC counts were divided by the total length <lb/>of the trial to calculate NVCs per second. To quantify overall bladder pressure trends seen <lb/>between agents, pressure slopes were calculated for three distinct time periods: (1) infusion <lb/>start to 100 seconds before void, (2) 100 to 50 seconds before void, and (3) last 50 seconds <lb/>before void. To visualize the changes seen during slope calculations over different pressure and <lb/>time ranges across cats and test sessions, the bladder pressure was normalized from 0 (start) <lb/>to peak/void (1000) on the x (time) axis. After noting that pressures did not significantly fluctuate <lb/>from resting baseline pressure until about 675 normalized time units, the 675-1000 normalized <lb/>time unit range was targeted, and the pressure was normalized from 0 to 1 within that window. <lb/>Continuous heart rate readings during non-terminal trials for the last 3 cats were also processed <lb/>similarly, but over the entire length of the trial. Statistics were analyzed using JMP Pro 14.2.0 <lb/>(SAS Institution Inc. Cary, NC), using a mixed model approach, setting anesthetic agent as a <lb/>fixed variable and animal as a random variable. For analysis of bladder capacity, the cat weight <lb/>was set as an additional fixed variable. Nominal categorical data was converted to ordinal <lb/>categorical data in order to fit the mixed model. Yes/some/no, tight/mid/loose, and <lb/>constricted/mid/dilated were converted to 0/0.5/1 respectively. Pairwise comparisons were <lb/>made using Tukey&apos;s HSD. Significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Where relevant, data is <lb/>reported as mean ± standard deviation. <lb/></body>
