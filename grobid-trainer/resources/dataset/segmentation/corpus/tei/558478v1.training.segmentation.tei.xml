According to these theories, the precision of cortical unsigned prediction error <lb/>(i.e., surprise) signals plays a key role in learning and decision-making, to be controlled by <lb/>dopamine, and to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis. To test these hypotheses, we <lb/>studied learning with variable outcome-precision in healthy individuals after dopaminergic <lb/>modulation and in patients with early psychosis. Behavioural computational modelling <lb/>indicated that precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors benefits learning in health, <lb/>and is impaired in psychosis. FMRI revealed coding of unsigned prediction errors relative to <lb/>their precision in bilateral superior frontal gyri and dorsal anterior cingulate, which was <lb/>perturbed by dopaminergic modulation, impaired in psychosis, and associated with task <lb/>performance and schizotypy. We conclude that precision-weighting of cortical prediction <lb/>error signals is a key mechanism through which dopamine modulates inference and <lb/>contributes to the pathogenesis of psychosis. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>A common theme in contemporary theories of brain function, ranging from perception (Rao <lb/>&amp; Ballard, 1999) to reinforcement learning (Mathys et al., 2011), is an emphasis on the <lb/>critical role played by prior predictions in inference (Rao &amp; Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2009; <lb/>Bastos et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Mathys et al., 2011 &amp; 2014; Iglesias et al., 2013; <lb/>Clark, 2013 &amp; 2015; Hohwy, 2013). According to these theories, predictions and incoming <lb/>sensory input each have an associated precision (inverse variance), reflecting their <lb/>confidence or reliability. Predictions and sensory input are thought to be compared against <lb/>one other, generating a discrepancy signal termed the prediction error which indicates the <lb/>difference between the expectation and sensory input. Such prediction error signals update <lb/>prior beliefs in a manner that is weighted by their associated precision, such that more is <lb/>learned from precise and reliable prediction errors compared to noisy and unreliable <lb/>prediction errors (Friston, 2009; Bastos et al., 2012; Mathys et al., 2011 &amp; 2014; Iglesias et <lb/>al., 2013). Several theorists have suggested that neuromodulator systems, including <lb/>dopamine, play an important role in mediating the precision of these prediction errors, and <lb/>that impaired precision-weighting of prediction errors (through dopaminergic or other <lb/>neuromodulator dysfunction) may be part of the cascade that result in psychotic symptoms <lb/>(Bastos et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Friston, 2009; Mathys et al., 2014; Fletcher &amp; Frith <lb/>2009). However, to the best of our knowledge no direct evidence for these hypotheses <lb/>exists. Specifically, whilst several neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormal brain <lb/>prediction error signals in schizophrenia and related psychoses (Corlett et al 2007, Murray et <lb/>al 2008, Schlagenhauf et al 2014, Ermakova et al 2018), none of these studies have <lb/>addressed precision-weighting of prediction errors in patients. <lb/>In the context of reinforcement learning models, a distinction can be made between two <lb/>types of prediction errors. First, the signed prediction error indicates whether an outcome is <lb/>better or worse than expected, and thereby plays a crucial role in changing the value <lb/>allocated to cues, thereby guiding future decisions (Schultz et al., 1997; O&apos;Doherty et al., <lb/>2003 &amp; 2004; Pessiglione et al., 2006; D&apos;Ardenne et al., 2008; Diederen et al., 2016 &amp; 2017, <lb/>Tian et al., 2016). A second type of prediction error, the unsigned prediction error, signals <lb/>the degree of surprise, without indicating valence (better/ worse than expected). In addition <lb/>to signed prediction errors, unsigned prediction error are included in various reinforcement <lb/></body>

			<body>learning models to control how much should be learned from new information. Large <lb/>unsigned prediction errors signal that the brain&apos;s model of the world is inaccurate, thereby <lb/>increasing the amount that is learned from new information. This can be achieved in various <lb/>ways, including a non-Bayesian approach by using a dynamic learning rate parameter <lb/>(Pearce &amp; Hall, 1980; Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998) or a Bayesian approach by decreasing the <lb/>precision of prior beliefs (Courville et al., 2006; Gershman, 2015) across different levels in <lb/>the hierarchy so that new sensory information has more of an impact on learning (Mathys et <lb/>al., 2011 &amp; 2014; Iglesias et al., 2013). In these hierarchical models both signed and unsigned <lb/>prediction errors are weighted by their precision. Whilst evidence has been provided for a <lb/>dopamine-mediated precision-weighted signed prediction error in learning (Diederen et al., <lb/>2015, 2016 &amp; 2017), no such evidence exists for dopaminergic modulation of the precision-<lb/>weighting of unsigned prediction errors. This is despite many computational theorists <lb/>hypothesizing a role for neuromodulator systems in precision-weighting of unsigned <lb/>prediction errors (Bastos et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Mathys et al., 2014), and that the <lb/>dysfunctional precision-weighting is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of psychosis <lb/>(Fletcher &amp; Frith 2009; Adams et al 2013, Sterzer et al 2018, Heinz et al 2018). <lb/>Here we therefore studied whether unsigned prediction errors are indeed coded relative to <lb/>their associated precision; whether dopamine modulates the precision of these prediction <lb/>errors; where precision-weighted prediction errors are represented in the cortex and <lb/>whether and how precision weighting of cortical prediction error signals is disrupted in <lb/>psychosis. Our methods elicit reliable measures of prediction error, as we use a task where <lb/>prediction error is directly observable, rather than inferred as a latent variable as is common <lb/>in many paradigms. To probe the role of precision-weighted prediction errors in learning, <lb/>and the influence of dopamine, we employed pharmacological modulation in healthy <lb/>volunteers, combined with fMRI, associative learning and computational modelling. We next <lb/>examined how individual differences in computational learning signals and brain precision <lb/>weighting signals relate to clinical psychosis, and psychotic-like thinking in health <lb/>(schizotypy). We show that unsigned prediction errors are coded in superior frontal cortex, <lb/>where the unsigned prediction error signal is coded relative to the precision of <lb/>environmental outcomes; that the degree of precision-weighting benefits learning, is <lb/></body>

			<body>mediated by dopamine, is perturbed in first episode psychosis, and relates to schizotypy in a <lb/>health. <lb/>Results <lb/>Participants undertook a cognitive task in which they were presented with <lb/>rewards/monetary outcomes on each trial that were drawn from distributions with specific <lb/>degrees of precision (i.e. inverse variance). They were instructed to best-predict drawn <lb/>rewards, with the most accurate prediction corresponding to the mean of the reward <lb/>distribution. Crucially, we manipulated the precision of reward information by including <lb/>distributions with different degrees of precision. We first examined the role of precision <lb/>weighting of unsigned prediction errors on learning and the effect of dopaminergic <lb/>modulation, by applying a novel, theoretically motivated, analysis to a dataset from an <lb/>experiment (Diederen et al 2017) in which healthy volunteers were randomised to receive <lb/>either placebo, sulpiride (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), or bromocriptine (a <lb/>dopamine receptor agonist) and undertook the task in the MRI scanner. Subsequently, we <lb/>repeated the same fMRI task in patients with early psychosis and matched controls. Finally, <lb/>we also examine inter-individual differences in trait psychosis &quot;schizotypy&quot; in relation to <lb/>precision-weighting. <lb/>Figure 1: Example of a trial. The participants were instructed to learn the mean of a reward distribution. First a fixation <lb/>cross was presented after which the participants were informed about the standard deviation (which indicated the <lb/>precision) of the reward distribution. Subsequently the participants were asked to make a prediction regarding the <lb/>upcoming reward, which was presented to the participant in combination with the prediction error (in yellow) after an <lb/>anticipation period. <lb/>High Low <lb/>(Cue; Precision = medium) <lb/></body>

			<body>Study 1: Dopamine modulation study <lb/>Environmental precision and dopamine D2 receptor antagonism modulate task performance. <lb/>In the dopamine modulation study we explored the influence of precision and dopaminergic <lb/>medication on performance, which was defined as the distance between the participants <lb/>prediction and the mean of the distribution, as the latter corresponds to the most accurate <lb/>prediction. We found that participants&apos; performance increased when the precision of the <lb/>reward distributions increased, and reduced average performance under sulpiride (a <lb/>dopamine D2 receptor antagonist). Trial-by-trial analysis revealed lower performance in low-<lb/>precision conditions at the start of the experiment, but no significant group differences. We <lb/>studied whether dopaminergic modulation influenced scrolling distance, missed trials and <lb/>reaction times as this might explain differences in performance. However, dopaminergic <lb/>modulation did not affect scrolling distance or missed trials, although reaction times were <lb/>increased under sulpiride (see Fig. 2 and supplementary information). <lb/></body>

			<body>Reinforcement learning modelling of behavioural data indicates precision-weighted unsigned <lb/>and signed prediction errors <lb/>We used two complementary approaches to demonstrate the contribution of unsigned <lb/>prediction errors. First we used a general linear model with signed and unsigned prediction <lb/>errors and their interaction term as independent variables and learning -defined as the <lb/>change in predicted reward from one trial to the next -as the dependent variable. Here we <lb/>showed that the unsigned*signed prediction error interaction term was highly significant in <lb/>predicting learning (F{1,10763}=51.7, p&lt;.0001), demonstrating the importance of unsigned <lb/>prediction errors (for more details, see supplementary results). In addition, we fitted various <lb/>reinforcement learning models to the participants&apos; trial-wise predictions to investigate <lb/>whether participants were likely to make use of precision-weighted unsigned and signed <lb/>prediction errors. In all three medication groups a Pearce-Hall model with separate <lb/>estimated precision weighted signed and unsigned prediction errors best predicted <lb/>participants&apos; predictions (model comparison using AIC to penalize models for the number of <lb/>free parameters; see table 1 for an overview of the model (free) parameters and models&apos; fits <lb/>and comparisons). These results indicate that both unsigned and signed prediction errors are <lb/>precision-weighted to facilitate efficient learning under uncertainty. By simulating data using <lb/>the estimated model parameters and correlating this with the acquired data, we show that <lb/>the correlation between the simulated and the real data is comparable across groups (R 2 <lb/>placebo: .20 (SE= .035), sulpiride: .18 (SE= .034), bromocriptine: .19 (SE= .026), similar to <lb/>other studies (e.g. Powers et al., 2017). <lb/></body>

PH -Pearce-Hall. <lb/>Bromocriptine increases learning rates <lb/>The best-performing computational model contained 4 free parameters (initial learning rate, <lb/>decay parameter, precision-weighting of signed prediction error and unsigned prediction <lb/>error -see methods for details). As the model with a precision-weighting parameter <lb/>outperformed the models without, precision is expected to affect the learning rate and <lb/>decay parameters in the model. In order to explore this question further, we fitted the data <lb/>to each precision condition separately for each participant and tested for an effect of <lb/>precision on the model parameters. We tested for a main effect of group and precision on <lb/>the initial learning rate and decay parameter (see methods), and their interactions. We <lb/>found a significant effect of precision on the initial learning rate in the winning model, <lb/>reflecting higher learning rates when reward information was more precise (F{1,52}=16.83, <lb/>p&lt;.001). In addition we found a small, but significant, effect of group (F{2,52}=3.252, <lb/>p=.047), which was driven by higher learning rates in the bromocriptine group compared to <lb/>the sulpiride group (F{1,36}=7.266, p=.011).

			<body>Unsigned prediction errors are coded in the SFC and pre SMA/dACC <lb/>Trial-by-trial unsigned prediction error (absolute difference between predicted and observed <lb/>rewards) was included as a parametric modulator in our fMRI model. Whilst correcting for <lb/>whole brain comparisons, unsigned prediction errors were coded in various regions within <lb/>the frontal cortex, and parietal cortex (see Table 2). We used the left and right SFC and dACC <lb/>clusters as ROIs, as informed by previous work, to take forward our analysis of dopaminergic <lb/>effects on precision weighting. Secondary analyses examined these effects in occipital and <lb/>parietal regions (supplementary materials). <lb/>Table 2: Regions coding unsigned prediction error voxelwise whole brain corrected &lt;.05.

We used a two-factor mixed model ANOVA with medication group as <lb/>the between-subjects variable and precision condition as the within-subjects variable, using <lb/>a linear contrast across precision conditions for the main effect of precision and interaction. <lb/>In the left SFC cluster, there was a significant interaction across precision conditions and <lb/>medication group, suggesting that medication had a significant effect on precision-weighting <lb/>of unsigned prediction errors (F{2,56}=4.025 p=.023; Fig.6B). We then explored whether the <lb/>effect was driven by bromocriptine or sulpiride compared to placebo. We found a significant <lb/>interaction between medication group (placebo vs sulpiride) and precision condition (F{2,37} <lb/></body>

			<page>1 0 <lb/></page>

			<body>= 5.44, p=.025), with less precision-weighting in the sulpiride than in the placebo group, <lb/>which suggests that sulpiride dampens precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors. <lb/>Comparing the placebo and bromocriptine group, there was a significant effect of precision <lb/>(F{1,37} = 14.93, p&lt;.001), but no significant effect of medication group (placebo vs <lb/>bromocriptine) (F{1,37} = 2.781, p=.104) or interaction between medication group and <lb/>precision (F{2,36} = 0.02, p=.894). This finding suggests that left SFC unsigned prediction <lb/>error signals are precision-weighted, but relatively unaffected by bromocriptine. <lb/>In the right SFC we did not find a significant interaction between medication and precision <lb/>condition (F{2,56}=1.70, p=.193; Fig. 3C). However, signal changes in the right SFC are largely <lb/>the same as in the left SFC (see Fig. 3B). We did find a significant main effect of medication <lb/>(F{2,56}=3.65, p=.032). This effect was driven by a stronger main effect of unsigned <lb/>prediction error in the bromocriptine group compared to the placebo group (F{1,37}=6.740, <lb/>p=.013), whereas the difference was only trend-level significant between the sulpiride and <lb/>placebo group (F{1,38}=3.55, p=.067). <lb/>In the dACC we found a trend-level significant interaction between precision and medication <lb/>(F{2,56}=2.81, p=.069; Fig. 3D). Post-hoc tests between the placebo and sulpiride group <lb/>revealed a trend-level interaction between precision and medication (F{1,38}=3.043, <lb/>p=.089). Testing the placebo and bromocriptine group revealed a significant effect of <lb/>precision (F{1,37}=9.32, p=.004), but no effect of group (F{1,37}=1.17, p=.29) or interaction <lb/>(F{1,37}=.172, p=.68). A similar pattern was thus found in the dACC as in the left SFC (see Fig. <lb/>3B+D). <lb/>The degree of precision-weighting in the left and right SFC and dACC correlated with task <lb/>performance (controlling for group), such that higher precision-weighting relates to better <lb/>performance (Left Rho=-.45, p&lt;.001; Fig. 7A, Right: Rho=-.37, p=.005; Fig. 7B, dACC: Rho=-<lb/>.25, p=.057). Performance was quantified as the mean performance error (abs(actual mean -<lb/>predicted mean)) on the last three trials in each session (Fig. 4). <lb/>Figure. 3: A. Unsigned prediction errors were coded in bilateral superior frontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate <lb/>cortex. The left side of the brain is the left side of the image. B-D. When exploring these regions further, we find that <lb/>unsigned prediction errors are coded in a precision-weighted fashion as indicated by the strong unsigned prediction error <lb/>signal in the high precision condition which declines over the medium and low precision condition in the placebo and <lb/>bromocriptine group. Importantly, sulpiride perturbed precision-weighting significantly in the left SFC. Error bars <lb/>represent standard error of the mean. <lb/></body>

G: Learning rates were higher in the high precision condition compared to the <lb/>low precision condition in HC and ARMS, but not for FEPS, although an interaction was not significant. H: Precision did <lb/>not affect the learning rate decay parameter. I: HC had slightly fewer missed trials than FEP. J: Reaction times were equal <lb/>across groups. K: Scrolling distance was equal across groups. <lb/>FEP is associated with a lack of precision-weighting as revealed by computational modelling <lb/>As before, we compared two different families of computational models; two Rescorla-<lb/>Wagner reinforcement learning models and four Pearce-Hall learning models. We found that <lb/>for the HCS and ARMS participants the best model was the Pearce-Hall model with a <lb/>precision-weighting parameter for both the signed and unsigned prediction error term. <lb/>However, the FEP group followed a simple RW-learning rule without precision-weighting of <lb/>prediction error. This suggests that the FEP group specifically is not precision-weighting <lb/>prediction errors (Table 3). <lb/>To confirm the lack of precision-weighting in the FEP group compared to control <lb/>participants, we modelled the data separately for the high precision and low precision <lb/>condition, and compared the model parameters between the two conditions. We found that <lb/>both the HCS group T{29}=4.26, p&lt;.001) and the ARMS group T{22}=4.99, p&lt; .001) <lb/>presented with significantly higher learning rates in the high precision condition compared <lb/>to the low precision condition. By contrast, the FEP group did not show such a significant <lb/>difference between high and low precision conditions (T{18}=1.5, p=.15). However, when we <lb/>tested the precision by group interaction using a mixed (3x2) two-way ANOVA we did not <lb/>see a significant interaction (F{2,76}=1.68 , p=.193) (Fig. 5G). We found no differences in <lb/>learning rate decay between precision conditions for the HC group (T{29}=1.52, p= .14), <lb/>ARMS group (T{22}=-.26, p= .74), and FEP group (T{18}=-1.39, p= .18) (Fig. 5H). <lb/></body>

From these participant measures of <lb/>schizotypy (trait levels of schizophrenia-like thoughts and behaviour that occur on a <lb/>continuum in the general population) were taken around the time of scanning (Schizotypal <lb/>Personality Questionnaire, SPQ (Raine et al., 1991)). We tested for a relationship between <lb/>SPQ scores and precision-weighting of prediction error, while controlling for experimental <lb/>group. There was a significant correlation between performance and SPQ scores (Rho=-.23, <lb/>p=.034). This was mirrored by a significant brain signal-schizotypy correlation between SPQ <lb/>scores and the extracted right SFC precision-weighting parameter estimates (Rho=-.25, <lb/>p=.024)(Figure 6C). The higher schizotypal personality, the less the participants exhibited <lb/>cortical precision-weighting of prediction errors. Importantly, no relationship was observed <lb/>between schizotypy and the main-effect of prediction error (p&gt;.3), suggesting that the effect <lb/>is specific to the precision-weighting of prediction error. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Recent theories (Friston, 2009; Bastos et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Fletcher &amp; Frith, <lb/>2009; Sterzer et al., 2018) have hypothesised that precision-weighting of cortical prediction <lb/>errors is mediated by neuromodulators (including dopamine), and link a malfunctioning <lb/>dopamine system to psychosis through aberrant precision-weighting of these prediction <lb/>errors. However, to our knowledge, no direct evidence for any of these claims exists. Here <lb/>we showed that separately estimated precision-weighted signed and unsigned prediction <lb/>errors provided the best description of the behavioural data, thus suggesting that both <lb/>precision-weighted and unsigned prediction errors should be represented in the brain. The <lb/>representation of precision weighted signed prediction errors in subcortical areas was <lb/>confirmed previously by fMRI in humans (Diederen et al., 2016). In the present study, we <lb/>tested the prediction that unsigned prediction errors would be represented in the brain, and <lb/>found evidence for a precision weighted cortical representation of unsigned prediction in <lb/>the bilateral superior frontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary <lb/>motor area (that we collectively referred to as SFC). Importantly, this precision weighting <lb/>was significantly diminished in the sulpiride (dopamine D2 receptor antagonism) group in <lb/>comparison to the other groups in the right SFC; there was marginal evidence of a <lb/>medication effect in the dACC. This finding suggests that the dopamine D2 receptor plays a <lb/>key role in the mechanisms underlying precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors. <lb/>We furthermore found that a greater degree of superior frontal precision-weighting of <lb/>unsigned prediction error was significantly correlated to performance on the task, where an <lb/>increase in precision-weighting resulted in more accurate predictions of upcoming rewards. <lb/>These results confirm the hypothesis that there exist cortical unsigned prediction error <lb/>signals, which influence performance and are precision weighted by dopamine. <lb/>The coding of unsigned prediction errors in the superior and middle frontal gyri and dACC is <lb/>in line with earlier findings by Hayden (et al., 2011) who found unsigned prediction errors in <lb/>the dACC of monkeys, and with prior fMRI studies in humans (Fletcher et al 2001, Turner et <lb/>al 2004, Fouragnan et al., 2017; Fouragnan et al 2018; Metereau et al., 2013; Ide et al., <lb/>2013). Our findings are consistent with those of Katthagen et al 2018, who used reaction <lb/>time data (rather than choice data) from a human fMRI reversal learning study to derive a <lb/></body>

			<page>2 0 <lb/></page>

			<body>relevance weighted unsigned prediction error signal, which was also represented in the <lb/>dACC. Our data in both the dopaminergic modulation dataset, and in the psychosis study <lb/>dataset show that SFC prediction error signals based on choice data are precision-weighted <lb/>in humans. We note that dopaminergic innervation of cortex is greatest in superior frontal <lb/>regions (Lewis et al., 1987; Berger et al., 1991; Paus, 2001), compatible with the hypothesis <lb/>that precision weighting is influenced here by dopaminergic input. <lb/>If the precision-weighting of prediction errors is important in learning, we can expect <lb/>aberrant learning to occur when prediction errors are not scaled optimally to the <lb/>environmental statistics determining the precision of available information. We tested <lb/>whether this mechanism could be of importance to psychosis, which is characterized by <lb/>delusional beliefs and hallucinatory perception (Fletcher &amp; Frith et al., 2009). Previous work <lb/>showed aberrant cortical and subcortical prediction error coding in people with psychosis <lb/>(Murray et al., 2008; Corlett et al., 2007, Ermakova et al., 2018). As psychosis has <lb/>consistently been associated with dopamine dysfunction (Howes et al., 2009), it is likely that <lb/>a dopamine mediated precision-weighting process would be impaired in psychosis. Indeed, it <lb/>has been suggested that dopamine dysregulation causes psychosis due to affecting the <lb/>brains capacity to precision-weight prediction error (Adams et al., 2013). That is, if unreliable <lb/>prediction errors were given excessive weight, they could have an exaggerated influence on <lb/>driving changes in the brain&apos;s model of the world, thereby contributing to the formation of <lb/>abnormal beliefs. <lb/>We extended previous studies showing abnormal brain prediction error signals in psychosis <lb/>by testing the degree of precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors in a clinical <lb/>psychosis population. Here we found several lines of evidence suggesting that FEP in <lb/>particular is associated with a failure to precision-weight prediction errors. First, FEP was <lb/>associated with decreased performance on the task. Furthermore, the FEP group did not <lb/>benefit as much from more precision reward information than the healthy controls and <lb/>ARMS group did. This could potentially be driven by a ceiling effect, where the performance <lb/>in the FEP group is so poor that the difference between the high precision and low precision <lb/>condition is attenuated. However, this is unlikely: the distance between the participants <lb/>predictions and actual mean of the distribution towards the end of the experiment (the <lb/></body>

			<page>2 1 <lb/></page>

			<body>measure of performance used in the present study) were below 14 points in both precision <lb/>conditions, which is better than expected from random guessing on a 100 point scale. <lb/>Secondly, computational modelling suggests that the FEP group does not precision-weight <lb/>prediction errors, as they follow a simple RW learning rule without precision-weighted <lb/>prediction errors. By contrast, controls and ARMS follow a Pearce-Hall learning rule with <lb/>precision-weighted prediction errors. This invites the question whether the poor <lb/>performance of the FEP group might have more to do with the failure to diminish their <lb/>learning rate appropriately over time (as this is what characterizes a Pearce-Hall model). <lb/>However, subsequent analysis revealed that whereas controls and ARMS show a clear effect <lb/>of precision on learning rate, the FEP group does not. In contrast, no differences were found <lb/>for the decay parameter, suggesting that the differences lie in how much prediction errors <lb/>are used in different precision conditions. Thirdly, neural evidence suggests that the FEP <lb/>group does not precision-weight cortical prediction errors to the extent that healthy controls <lb/>do, and that the degree of neural abnormality may relate to positive psychotic symptom <lb/>severity. <lb/>Although we demonstrate that in health, dopaminergic modulation influences precision <lb/>weighting of the prediction error signal in the superior cortex, and we demonstrate <lb/>abnormal SFC precision weighting in psychosis, we cannot conclude that the abnormalities in <lb/>patients were of dopaminergic origin, as we make no neurochemical measures in patients. <lb/>Such inference would require either a pharmacological design in patients, or the use of <lb/>neurochemical imaging such as PET. One possible confound in the patient study is the use of <lb/>anti-psychotic medication in some patients, given that we showed that precision-weighting <lb/>of prediction errors is diminished after healthy controls take a dopamine D2-receptor <lb/>antagonist in controls. We addressed this issue by showing that there are no differences in <lb/>precision-weighting within the participants who take anti-psychotics and those who do not. <lb/>We furthermore showed that there is no relationship between anti-psychotic dosage and <lb/>the degree of precision-weighting in this study. Furthermore we demonstrated evidence for <lb/>aberrancies in cortical precision-weighting of prediction errors, and impaired task <lb/>performance, relating to schizotypal personality in the healthy population, where <lb/>medication cannot be a confound. We thus conclude that there is no evidence in the <lb/></body>

			<body>present study that the reported effects in patients are driven by the use of anti-psychotic <lb/>medications. <lb/>Several other studies have used this computational framework to study learning in <lb/>individuals with psychosis that imply a failure to precision weight prediction errors. For <lb/>example in a pharmacological model of psychosis, Vinckier (et al., 2015) found that ketamine <lb/>modulated a confidence parameter in a reinforcement learning model, which controls the <lb/>degree to which prediction errors influence learning. Confidence might be implicated in the <lb/>brain through a precision-weighting process, where prediction errors are coded as less <lb/>precise when confidence increases, so less is learned from new prediction errors. <lb/>Furthermore, Deserno (et al., 2017) and Powers (et al., 2017) have used hierarchical <lb/>Bayesian models to make inferences about the way individuals with schizophrenia and <lb/>psychosis respectively form beliefs about the environment. Critically in these models a <lb/>prediction error is weighted by the precision of beliefs regarding cue-outcome <lb/>contingencies, and the volatility of these relationships (Mathys et at., 2011 &amp; 2014; Iglesias <lb/>et al., 2013). As such, these models imply precision-weighting of prediction, however they <lb/>do not test the degree to which these prediction errors are precision-weighted explicitly. <lb/>Our results complement these studies and provide an additional direct test of the degree of <lb/>precision weighting of prediction errors in psychosis. <lb/>A previous study has reported differences between healthy controls and individuals with <lb/>schizophrenia in the degree to which they adapt the coding of value to the variability in the <lb/>environment (Kirschner et al., 2016). This process of adaptive coding is similar to precision <lb/>weighting of unsigned prediction errors, as it reflects the brains capacity to scale neural <lb/>signals to what is referred to as economic &apos;risk&apos;, in other words the spread of possible <lb/>reward outcomes. In combination with the present findings, psychotic disorder might be <lb/>associated with a broader failure to adapt neural signals to the statistics of the environment. <lb/>We thus conclude that there is evidence for a diminishment in precision-weighting of <lb/>unsigned prediction errors in individuals with first episode psychosis. This was most strongly <lb/>related to the intensity of the positive symptoms experienced by the patients in this study. <lb/>Our current study provides evidence for a key hypothesis in the field of predictive coding <lb/>theories of psychosis, which is that psychosis is associated with a failure to accurately take <lb/></body>

			<page>2 3 <lb/></page>

			<body>into account the reliability of new information, leading to the formation of aberrant <lb/>inferences about the world, predisposing to delusional beliefs. <lb/>Our findings are in line with the wide literature on adaptive coding of neural signals to <lb/>context. Adaptive coding seems to be a feature of many neural systems (Brenner et al., <lb/>2000; Fairhall et al., 2001; Barlow et al., 1961; Laughlin et al., 1981), ranging from the <lb/>perceptual system (Ohzawa et al., 1982; Smirnakis et al., 1997) to reward systems (Tobler et <lb/>al., 2005; Park et al., 2012). Indeed, previous studies that used the present paradigm have <lb/>framed these questions in terms of adaptive coding of signed reward prediction errors <lb/>rather than precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors (Diederen et al., 2016 &amp; 2017). <lb/>However, adaptive coding of neural signals to the statistics of the environment follows <lb/>directly from predictive coding models of neural functioning which suggest that prediction <lb/>errors should be weighted by their precision (Srinivasan et al., 1982). Here the adaptive <lb/>coding of prediction errors equals precision-weighting. Therefore, we believe that the <lb/>framework of adaptive coding and precision-weighting do not constitute competing <lb/>interpretations of the data, but rather that adaptive coding is a feature that follows from <lb/>predictive coding models. <lb/>In the present study, no differences were found with regards to the ARMS group. This is in <lb/>line with recent work showing intact cortical prediction error responses in ARMS (Ermakova <lb/>et al., 2018). There might be different reasons for this. First, considering that the effects <lb/>were correlated with severity of symptoms, and the symptoms in the ARMS group were <lb/>significantly lower, the lack of a significant finding for the ARMS group might be a matter of <lb/>severity. Indeed, if we separate the ARMS group and FEP group and correlate the degree of <lb/>precision-weighting with positive symptoms, we find comparable r values for both groups <lb/>(ARMS: r=-.30, FEP: r=-.36), although neither is significant in isolation due to the small N. An <lb/>alternative is that the aberrancies are disease category specific, which could be relevant as <lb/>only a minority of ARMS patients will go on to develop psychotic illness (Morrison et al 2012 <lb/>BMJ). Future studies with more power, ideally including longitudinal follow-up, would clarify <lb/>these issues. <lb/></body>

			<page>2 4 <lb/></page>

			<body>In conclusion, we found evidence of precision-weighted unsigned prediction errors in the <lb/>superior frontal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. Furthermore, we found that the <lb/>precision-weighting of prediction errors was modulated by the dopaminergic antagonist <lb/>sulpiride, and we found that the degree of precision-weighting in this area was correlated to <lb/>performance on the task, providing evidence for the first time that dopamine plays a role in <lb/>precision-weighting of unsigned prediction error signals during learning. We demonstrate <lb/>the clinical relevance of the unsigned prediction error signal by showing that it is, as <lb/>predicted, abnormal in psychotic illness, and that it relates to trait levels of schizotypy in the <lb/>healthy population. <lb/></body>

A further 63 participants were recruited, of which 4 were excluded due to <lb/>feeling unwell during scanning and/or a failure to complete the paradigm, or side-effects of <lb/>the medication. All participants were recruited via the distribution of flyers in Cambridge and <lb/>advertisements on Gumtree. Drug screenings were all negative. After receiving detailed <lb/>information about the study, all participants gave written informed consent. Schizotypy was <lb/>measured on these participants using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. <lb/>Pharmacological dopaminergic challenge <lb/>Participants received a single dose of the D2-antagonist sulpiride (600mg), the dopamine <lb/>agonist Bromocriptine (2.5 mg), or placebo, in a double-blind fashion.

Optimal performance on this task required the participant to estimate the mean of <lb/>the distribution from which the rewards were drawn. The task consisted of three sessions of <lb/></div>

			<page>2 8 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">10 minutes each. The rewards were drawn from six different pseudo-Gaussian distributions <lb/>that differed with respect to their precision (i.e. inverse variance) and expected value (i.e. <lb/>mean of the distribution; EV). For the dopamine and Schizotypy study, the standard <lb/>deviations from the distributions were 5, 10 &amp; 15, corresponding to precision of .01, .04 and <lb/>.004. For the psychosis study, the standard deviation of the distributions were either 5 or 15, <lb/>corresponding to precision of .01 and .004. Distributions were counterbalanced to ensure <lb/>that the two conditions within each session differed with respect to the EV and precision. <lb/>The conditions were presented in short blocks, each including 4-6 trials. Each distribution <lb/>consisted of 31 trials, which resulted in a total number of trials of 62 per session. The <lb/>participants were informed beforehand that each distribution (of which two per session) had <lb/>a different level of precision, which could be one of three levels: low, medium or high <lb/>precision, corresponding to precisions of 0.004, 0.04 and 0.01 although the exact precisions <lb/>were not revealed to the participants (in the psychosis study there was no medium <lb/>condition). Each trial started with a fixation cross that was presented between 2100 and <lb/>4200ms. The fixation cross was followed by a cue that was presented for 500ms. This cue <lb/>informed the participant from which of two distributions (high, medium or low) in that block <lb/>the upcoming reward was being drawn. After the cue was presented the participants were <lb/>required to predict the magnitude of the upcoming reward. They had 3500ms to make this <lb/>prediction. Making the prediction involved scrolling a mouse ball with their fingers up and <lb/>down, and clicking the left mouse button to state their prediction. This resulted in moving a <lb/>bar up and down the screen on a scale that ranged from 0 to 100. The starting point on the <lb/>bar was randomized throughout the experiment, to ensure that scrolling distance did not <lb/>correlate with participants&apos; predictions. The participants were instructed to minimize the <lb/>prediction error, i.e. the difference between the expected and the actual obtained reward. <lb/>After the prediction, another fixation cross was presented for duration between 2100 and <lb/>5250ms. Thereafter, the obtained reward was presented in addition to the prediction and <lb/>the reward prediction error for 1000ms (see Fig. 7 for an example trial). <lb/>Pay-off <lb/>If the participants would always receive the amount of money drawn by the computer, this <lb/>might have reduced their motivation to reveal their true prediction. Therefore, the <lb/>participants were rewarded according to their accuracy (i.e., proximity to the mean of the <lb/></div>

In order to test the performance of the <lb/>participants, we analysed whether the predictions of the participants approached the mean <lb/>of the distribution (or expected value (EV)), during the experiment. We calculated the <lb/>absolute difference between the EV and the prediction in across all trials and averaged <lb/>across the 3 sessions. We computed bonferonni corrected paired t-tests to test the effect of <lb/>precision across and within groups and the differences across groups (see figure 2&amp;5A-E). <lb/>We also tested for an effect of group and precision on average distance across the <lb/>experiment. In addition, we analysed differences in scrolling distance to exclude the <lb/>possibility that drug effects influenced willingness to do the task, resulting in a decrease in <lb/>scrolling distance. We also analysed differences in reaction times and missed trials for the <lb/>same reason. <lb/>Linear regression model <lb/>In order to explore the contribution of signed and unsigned prediction error to learning we <lb/>used a linear regression model with belief-updating as dependent variable and both <lb/>unsigned and signed prediction error as independent variables. Belief updating here is <lb/>defined as the change in value estimate from t n to t n+1 . That is, when the participant expects <lb/>a value of 20 on t 1 and expect as value of 30 on t 2 there was a belief update of 10, which is <lb/>expected to be explained by a prediction error experienced at t 1 . Since signed prediction <lb/>errors, but not unsigned prediction errors inform the participant about the direction of <lb/>learning, we expect the former but not the latter to have a main effect on belief-updating. <lb/>Furthermore, since formal learning models like the Pearce-Hall model (Pearce &amp; Hall, 1980), <lb/>suggest that unsigned prediction errors increase learning, we expect an interaction between <lb/>unsigned and signed prediction error on belief-updating. In order to visualise the effect of <lb/>signed and unsigned prediction errors on belief-updating, we will create bins on the basis of <lb/>signed prediction errors and plot belief-updating on the y-axis. If unsigned prediction errors <lb/>interact with signed prediction error in predicting belief-updating we should expect to see a <lb/>logit or sigmoid relationship between signed prediction error and belief updating. <lb/></div>

This is a standard reinforcement learning model, and allows to <lb/>estimate to which degree prediction errors are being used by the participant by estimating <lb/>the learning rate parameter (Sutton &amp; Barto et al., 1998). <lb/>The first model consisted of a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) reinforcement learning model with a <lb/>fixed learning rate. A fixed learning rate prescribes that each prediction error is weighted <lb/>equally during learning (e.g., independent of whether a prediction error occurred at the <lb/>start, or the end of a session): <lb/>k n = α <lb/>Equation 2 <lb/>The second model consisted of a Pearce-Hall (PH) model with a trial-wise, dynamic, learning <lb/>rate, which prescribes higher weighting of prediction errors (i.e., more learning) at the start <lb/>of a task session compared to later trials (Pearce et al., 1980). In uncertain environments, it <lb/>is more optimal to decrease the weighting of prediction errors as learning progresses (once <lb/>participants become more certain of their predictions) as prediction errors will continue to <lb/>occur as a result of the imposed uncertainty. The PH learning rate decays as trial progress, as <lb/>a function of the previous learning rate and the experienced prediction error, which allows <lb/>for fast updating of predictions at the beginning of each task session: <lb/>k n = +C|δ n-1 | + (1 -+) k n-1 <lb/>Equation 3 <lb/>in which |δ| is the absolute prediction error, C is an arbitrary scaling coefficient and X is the <lb/>learning rate decay. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">We additionally explored whether scaling prediction error to the reliability of the <lb/>environment (i.e., precision-weighting) benefitted learning by comparing models that scaled <lb/>the prediction error term and models that did not. We both explored models that simply <lb/>precision-weighted the prediction error by a constant term ω (equation 4&amp;5), and models <lb/>that estimated the degree υ of precision-weighting for each individual (equation 6). The <lb/>precision here is the true precision, and not the trial-by-trial estimated precision as <lb/>participants were informed prior to the experiment which of the cues indicated the high, <lb/>medium and low variance condition. We estimated both models that had a single estimated <lb/>υ for both signed and unsigned prediction errors and a model that had a separate variable <lb/>for signed and unsigned prediction errors. In contrast to earlier studies (Diederen et al., <lb/>2015, 2016 &amp; 2017) we used a more simplified model that utilised a linear precision-<lb/>weighted model to ease interpretation. <lb/>y n = y n-1 + k n (δ/ ω) n <lb/>Equation 4 <lb/>k n = +C|(δ n-1 / ω)| + (1 -+) k n-1 <lb/>Equation 5 <lb/>ω = 1-υ+ υ*(SD) <lb/>Equation 6 <lb/>For the Pearce-Hall model we explored the scaling of the signed and unsigned prediction <lb/>error separately, as well as combined. <lb/>We fitted the free parameter φ to the subjective predictions Y by maximizing the likelihood <lb/>‫‬ሺܻ|߶ሻ ൌ ߎ ெ ‫ݕ‪ሺ‬‬ |߶ሻ , where ‫ݕ‪ሺ‬‬ |߶ሻ ൌ ߋሺߤ , ߪ ො ଶ ሻ , and ܻ ൌ ሾ‫ݕ‬ ଵ ‫ݕ‬ ଶ . . ‫ݕ‬ ሿ are the <lb/>subjective predictions.

Using SPM8 the functional images were <lb/>realigned first, after which the four different echoes were summed and averaged in order to <lb/>minimize signal intensity inhomogeneity due to differences in T2* relaxation times across <lb/>the brain (Poser et al., 2006). The functional images were subsequently coregistered to the <lb/>T1-weighted anatomical image in native-space by first coregistering one averaged functional <lb/>image, after which the coregistration parameters of this registration were applied to the all <lb/>the functional images in order to registered to native space. Unified segmentation was used <lb/>in order to achieve the normalization of the functional and anatomical images to MNI space <lb/>(Ashburner et al., 2005). Unified segmentation is a single iterative model that combines <lb/>segmentation, bias correction and normalization in order to achieve optimal results. The <lb/>segmentation step was omitted for one of the participants; since it gave erroneous <lb/>segmentation parameters resulting in distortions in the normalized anatomical T1 scan. The <lb/>segmentation step was later conducted using a different template, namely the East-Asian <lb/>template, which resulted in a correct segmentation. Spatial smoothing was performed using <lb/>8mm Gaussian kernels.

			<div type="annex">Supplementary results <lb/>Study 1: Dopamine study <lb/>Environmental precision and D2 antagonism modulate task performance. <lb/>First, we explored whether performance increases when environmental precision is high (i.e. <lb/>when the standard deviation of rewarding outcomes is low). We measured performance by <lb/>investigating how close participants&apos; predictions were to the actual mean of the distribution <lb/>on average (i.e., the average difference between the mean of the reward distribution). We <lb/>used a two-factor mixed model ANOVA with medication group as the between-subjects <lb/>variable and precision conditions as the within-subjects variable, using a linear contrast <lb/>across precision conditions for the main effect of precision and interaction between <lb/>precision and medication. We found that performance increased when the precision <lb/>increased (F{1,56}=11.3, p=.001), but there was no significant interaction between precision <lb/>and medication group (F{2,56}=1.3, p=.27). However, there was a trend-level effect of group <lb/>on average final performance (F{2,56}=2.5, p=.094).

Comparing the bromocriptine <lb/>group to placebo there was no significant overall difference (F{1,37}=2.01, p=.17) and no <lb/>significant interaction (F{1,37}=1.70, p=.20) (See Fig.2). <lb/>Elimination of possible confounding by effects on motivation <lb/>Since dopamine also plays an important role in motivation, we explored whether the <lb/>dopaminergic manipulation influenced measures of motivation, such as response times <lb/>(Crespi, 1942; Niv, 2007), how much the participants moved the mouse ball to state their <lb/>prediction (Fig. 3B; see methods section for more detail), and the number of missed trials <lb/>(Fig. 3D). Using one-way ANOVAs, we found that only response times were significantly <lb/>different across medication groups, with the sulpiride group being faster than placebo (RT: <lb/>F{2,55}=4.21, p=.019; Misses: F{2,55}=0.33, p=.72; Scrolling distance: F{2,55}=0.56, p=.57; <lb/>Fig. 3B-D).

Signed <lb/>prediction errors are defined in this task as the signed difference between predicted and <lb/>received reward. Unsigned prediction errors are defined as the absolute difference between <lb/>predicted and received reward. Both of these prediction errors can be observed directly in <lb/>our task, and thus in contrast to many other experimental paradigms, do not have to be <lb/>inferred as a latent variable using a modelling procedure. We expected a main effect of <lb/>signed prediction error on learning, but not of unsigned prediction as the former informs the <lb/>participants about the direction of belief updating, whereas the latter does not, and can <lb/>therefore not drive learning directly. However, Pearce-Hall reinforcement learning models <lb/>suggest that unsigned prediction errors increase the amount of attention devoted to a <lb/>stimulus. Thus we expect that when unsigned prediction errors are high, the effect of signed <lb/>prediction errors on learning is higher. That is, we expect there to be an interaction between <lb/>unsigned and signed prediction errors. In line with this expectation, we found a significant <lb/>interaction between signed and unsigned prediction errors (F{1,10763}=51.7, p&lt;.0001), <lb/>suggesting that learning is a function of both the signed and unsigned prediction error. In <lb/>addition, we observed a significant effect of signed prediction errors on learning <lb/>(F{1,10763}=246.95, p&lt;.0001), whereas the effect of unsigned prediction errors was <lb/>insignificant (F{1,10763}=.95, p=.33). We furthermore tested whether the precision <lb/>condition interacted with signed prediction errors on belief updating. Although there was no <lb/>main-effect of precision (F{2,10761}=.25, p=.78), there was indeed a significant interaction <lb/>between precision and signed prediction error (F{2,10761}=25.8, p&lt;.0001).
