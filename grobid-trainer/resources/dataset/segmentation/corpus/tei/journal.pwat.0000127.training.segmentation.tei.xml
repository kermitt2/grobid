This study aimed to assess the added value of utility and regu-<lb/>lator data for international monitoring by assessing factors affecting piped water availability <lb/>in urban and peri-urban Zambia. Household &apos;user&apos; data from the 2018 Demographic and <lb/>Health Survey (n = 3047) were spatially linked to provider data from an international utility <lb/>database and regulator reports. Multilevel modelling quantified provider-related and socio-<lb/>economic risk factors for households reporting water being unavailable for at least one day <lb/>in the previous fortnight. 47% (95% CI: 45%, 49%) of urban and peri-urban households <lb/>reported water being unavailable for at least one full day, ranging from 18% (95% CI: 14%, <lb/>23%) to 76% (95% CI: 70%, 81%) across providers. Controlling for provider, home owner-<lb/>ship (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; p &lt;0.01), speaking Luvale, Kaonde, Lunda (OR = 2.06; p <lb/>&lt;0.05) or Tonga (OR = 1.78; p &lt;0.1) as an ethnicity proxy, and dry season interview dates <lb/>(OR = 1.91; p &lt;0.05) were associated with household-reported interruptions. Households <lb/>using a neighbour&apos;s tap (OR = 1.33; p &lt;0.1) and in mid-wealth neighbourhoods (OR = 4.31; <lb/>p &lt;0.1) were more likely to report interruptions. For every $1000 increase in utility-level GDP <lb/>per capita, the odds of an interruption were 0.51 times less (p&lt;0.01). Substantial inequalities <lb/>in drinking-water availability were found between provider coverage areas. Spatial integra-<lb/>tion of user, provider and regulator data enriches analysis, providing a finer-scale perspec-<lb/>tive than otherwise possible.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to &apos;ensure the availability and sustainable <lb/>management of water and sanitation for all&apos; by 2030 [1]. The accompanying target 6.1, is to <lb/>achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking-water. The associated <lb/>indicator, 6.1.1, measures progress towards this target via the proportion of the population <lb/>using safely managed drinking-water services, requiring that drinking-water from an <lb/>improved service be available when needed [2]. Additionally, the World Health Organization <lb/>(WHO) outlines a global drinking-water availability benchmark which recommends that a <lb/>minimum of 50 litres/capita/day (LPCD) is needed to meet domestic needs, including wash-<lb/>ing, personal hygiene and cleaning [3, 4]. <lb/>Between 2000 and 2020 the proportion of the sub-Saharan African (SSA) population using <lb/>improved drinking-water sources that were available when needed increased from 41% to 59% <lb/>[5]. Over the same period, the population in SSA using piped water doubled from 185 to 380 mil-<lb/>lion. However, coverage of piped water services in urban areas has not kept up with population <lb/>growth, declining from 65% to 59% between 2000 and 2020 [5]. In 2015, an estimated 116 million <lb/>people in Africa were supplied by an unreliable piped water system prone to interruptions [6]. <lb/>Water services that are not available when needed may result in damage to water service infra-<lb/>structure, compromise water safety [7], adversely impact health [8, 9], and lead to additional <lb/>household expenditure on water storage, treatment and purchasing supplementary water [10], <lb/>with the latter often sourced from informal service providers and unimproved services [11]. <lb/>The transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the SDGs saw the spe-<lb/>cific addition of water availability to the international agenda, resulting in new demand for <lb/>data sources for monitoring [12]. Multiple sources, including household surveys (hereafter <lb/>&apos;user data&apos;), utility companies (hereafter &apos;provider data&apos;) and government regulators [13], hold <lb/>data on water service intermittency. Historically household survey questions on the availability <lb/>of drinking water services have not been harmonised, thus different countries may not use <lb/>consistent question and response wording. This complex data landscape is further exacerbated <lb/>by the challenges of measuring water availability, for which methods vary between studies <lb/>[14]. Metrics used include hours of service a day alongside service in the last week or month, <lb/>using household or per capita consumption per day, or the number of interruptions or break-<lb/>ages in a given time period [15]. In 2018, the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of the WHO <lb/>and United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF), who are responsible for international moni-<lb/>toring of SDG target 6.1, published a core question, &apos;In the last month, has there been any time <lb/>when your household did not have sufficient quantities of drinking-water when needed?&apos;, for <lb/>greater harmonisation and incorporation into household surveys for availability monitoring. <lb/>Since this is a new question and household surveys are implemented only every three to five <lb/>years, availability of internationally comparable survey data remains patchy. <lb/>As a result of patchy data and the use of multiple metrics of availability, national and inter-<lb/>national monitoring has been reliant on numerous data sources, presenting challenges for data <lb/>integration. Under the MDGs, monitoring was primarily dependent on household surveys <lb/>and census data [16], whereas more recently under the SDGs, there has been a shift towards <lb/>using information from regulators of providers alongside these more traditional sources [17]. <lb/>Regulators often produce annual reports which benchmark levels of service between different <lb/>providers. An additional data source concerning piped water service levels is available directly <lb/>from service provider records [18]. Many service providers report their performance data to <lb/>the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET). At pres-<lb/>ent, IBNET provides the most systematic international data on provider reported water avail-<lb/>ability [18]. <lb/></body>

			<body>To date, most studies that have sought to quantify risk factors for interruptions in water ser-<lb/>vices have focused almost exclusively on household surveys [19-21]. In comparing provider <lb/>and user data, one study conducted bespoke household surveys within four case study provider <lb/>coverage areas (PCAs) in Kenya and Ghana [11], whilst a second compared user-reported and <lb/>provider-reported service continuity at regional level in Peru [18]. However, since many <lb/>household surveys are now georeferenced [22], the new household survey question on service <lb/>continuity provides an opportunity for spatial integration of household reports of water service <lb/>interruptions with related statistics reported by service providers and regulators. Such spatial <lb/>integration would enable more detailed assessment of household versus regulator-or pro-<lb/>vider-reported service continuity for consistency, alongside evaluation of provider-level risk <lb/>factors for household-reported interruptions such as supply-side service management <lb/>indicators. <lb/>Barriers inhibiting household access to uninterrupted water services may exacerbate urban-<lb/>rural and socio-economic disparities that are evident in drinking-water services. In 2020, only <lb/>13% of the rural SSA population used services that were safely managed compared to 54% of <lb/>the urban population [5]. With the SDGs seeking to &apos;leave no one behind&apos;, identifying and <lb/>addressing drivers of inequalities in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is critical. <lb/>In a city-scale study of Lilongwe, Malawi, water rationing of the formal water system led to <lb/>more irregular supply in low-income informal settlements [23], highlighting one driver of <lb/>such inequalities. However, whilst wealth quintile was associated with rural household access <lb/>to continuous water in Bangladesh and Pakistan [19], there is little evidence on urban or per-<lb/>urban inequalities in household access to continuous piped water in addition to such inequali-<lb/>ties at city or PCA scale. <lb/>The primary objective of this study was therefore to assess the added value of utility and <lb/>regulator data in estimating piped water availability and quantifying risk factors for piped <lb/>water intermittency and related inequalities. As secondary objectives, the study aims to assess <lb/>whether household survey data are sufficient in isolation to quantify water availability and <lb/>related risk factors, alongside identifying barriers to more widespread integrated analyses of <lb/>household survey, utility, and regulatory data sets. Data on water service availability from <lb/>users, providers and regulators were first mapped to identify a suitable case study country to <lb/>examine risk factors for user-reported interruptions in piped water services in SSA. Since <lb/>Africa shows the least progress towards SDG 6 [5], and Zambia had near contemporaneous <lb/>data from users, providers and regulators that could be spatially linked, it was selected as the <lb/>case study. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Ethical approval <lb/>Ethical approval for the use of all data was received from the University of Southampton Ethics <lb/>Committee (Submission ID # 55516) on 10th March 2020. <lb/>Study country selection <lb/>A systematic secondary data audit (S1 Fig; S1-S3 Tables) was undertaken via the JMP&apos;s 2019 <lb/>country files [24] and IBNET database [25] to identify an African Union (AU) member state <lb/>for which household survey or population census data, government regulator data and water <lb/>providers all report at least one water availability metric (i.e. a measure of the quantity of <lb/>household water supplied, or continuity of water service provision) covering the same year(s). <lb/>To facilitate subsequent multi-level analysis, countries eligible for inclusion required <lb/></body>

			<body>determined whether subsequent integration of the three data streams was possible. Zambia <lb/>was the only country where the administrative geography of drinking-water supply was suffi-<lb/>ciently simple to facilitate spatial linkage of household survey and provider data since PCA <lb/>(which are also used by the regulator) coincided with province boundaries. All three Zambian <lb/>data sources also covered the same year (S1 Table). <lb/>Study site <lb/>Located in southern-central Africa, Zambia is a landlocked country with a 2019 population of <lb/>nearly 19 million [26]; 45% live in urban areas [27]. Zambia&apos;s trans-boundary catchment areas <lb/>result in fluctuations of surface water availability because of the varying water demands of <lb/>neighbouring states [28]. Renewable water resources are affected by inconsistent seasonal rain-<lb/>fall, characterised by periodic drought [29]. Mismanagement and rapid urban growth have <lb/>also caused considerable stress on groundwater resources [30]. <lb/>Urban and peri-urban piped drinking-water is supplied to over six million people by 11 <lb/>commercial Water and Sewerage Companies (WSCs) [31]. Approximately 4,656,375 piped <lb/>water connections supply drinking-water in 91 towns (S4 Table). In total, an estimated 46% of <lb/>the urban population have a safely managed water service, that is available when needed [32]. <lb/>In rural Zambia, 35% have an unimproved service compared to 9% of the urban population <lb/>[32]. The National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO), a statutory body, is <lb/>responsible for regulating water and sanitation services across Zambia [33]. <lb/>Data sources and availability metrics <lb/>We used three main data sources in our study: <lb/>1. User data: nationally representative data from the Zambian Demographic and Health Sur-<lb/>vey (DHS) was used. This was implemented as a multi-stage cluster household survey from <lb/>18 th July 2018 to 24 th January 2019 [34]. Interviews were undertaken concurrently across all <lb/>provinces, using a stratified two-stage sample design [34]. We used geospatial data, geore-<lb/>ferenced to cluster level (comprising groups of approximately 25 households, selected at <lb/>random from a given census enumeration area). Cluster locations are provided as the mean <lb/>GPS coordinates for all participating households within each cluster, displaced within 2km <lb/>(for urban areas) to retain anonymity [35]. No sampling clusters were displaced outside of <lb/>their administrative district. To assess drinking-water availability, participating households <lb/>are asked &apos;In the last two weeks, was the water from your main source not available for at <lb/>least one full day?&apos;. <lb/>2. Provider data: To assess provider-level risk factors for reported interruptions, provider-<lb/>reported availability of piped services for all 11 WSCs was obtained from the IBNET data-<lb/>base for 2017, the most recent year available [36]. This includes metrics of availability, such <lb/>as continuity of service, as yearly average hours of service per day (hrs/day) [37], and yearly <lb/>average residential consumption in LPCD [38]. Details of non-revenue water, the difference <lb/>in water supplied and sold as a percentage of net water supplied [39], which inherently <lb/>affects service availability [40, 41] were also of interest as these reflect illegal use of piped <lb/>networks and water that has been stolen or leaked from the system. <lb/>3. Regulator data: since 2001, NWASCO have also annually reported on each WSC&apos;s perfor-<lb/>mance based on nine key indicators [33]. The annual average duration of water service <lb/>(hours/day) at the customer connection, and the average amount of water consumed in <lb/>LPCD were extracted from the publicly available 2018 NWASCO report [42] for each <lb/>WSC. <lb/></body>

			<body>Household inclusion criteria and data integration <lb/>With less than 5% of rural households using piped drinking-water services [5], provider and <lb/>regulator data from NWASCO do not cover rural areas [43]. Given this, 8,117 households in <lb/>347 rural clusters (comprising 16% of households nationally reporting piped water as their <lb/>drinking-water source) were excluded (Fig 2). 47 households in two clusters which had miss-<lb/>ing GPS coordinates were also excluded.

			<body>provider data were derived through aggregation of district administrative boundaries for Zam-<lb/>bia from the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database [44] and spatially joined to DHS <lb/>household clusters in ArcMap 10.7.1. The final dataset therefore included information on the <lb/>provider and regulator perspective of water availability at the PCA level (henceforth &apos;provider-<lb/>level&apos;) and the user perspective at household-level. <lb/>Households that did not drink piped water (whether from a connection in dwelling, yard/ <lb/>plot, neighbour or public tap/standpipe) were excluded (n = 1574) as they were not asked <lb/>about water service continuity [45], as were those who did not know about their piped water <lb/>continuity (n = 46) (Fig 2). <lb/>Outcome and explanatory variables <lb/>A binary outcome variable &apos;user reported availability of piped water&apos; was defined as respon-<lb/>dents reporting at least one full day of interruptions in the two weeks prior to being surveyed. <lb/>Explanatory variables at the household-, cluster-and provider-level were chosen to represent <lb/>socio-economic, water source, or neighbourhood characteristics that could constitute risk fac-<lb/>tors for piped water interruptions (S5 and S6 Tables). Household cluster-level variables were <lb/>created by aggregating data on households within each DHS cluster. <lb/>In modelling user-reported availability of piped water, the following household-level <lb/>explanatory variables were included: <lb/>• Since different types of connection are prone to different types of interruptions [46], type of <lb/>piped service (piped into dwelling, piped to neighbour, piped to yard/plot or public tap/ <lb/>standpipe) was included as a covariate. Users may also consume more water if it is piped to <lb/>the yard or home, than if located further afield, such as at a neighbour&apos;s or a public tap/ <lb/>standpipe [47]. <lb/>• The DHS&apos;s urban/rural wealth index was used as a household wealth variable. This considers <lb/>assets and services owned by rural populations alongside those owned by urban populations <lb/>[48]. Wealth relates to the type of piped service used [49] and affects household vulnerability <lb/>to interruptions. The wealthier pay tariffs more regularly, are less exposed to illegal connec-<lb/>tions or pipeline breakages, can afford to consume more water [50] and purchase storage <lb/>tanks which may protect from interruptions [51]. <lb/>• Month of interview was included as a proxy for seasonal water shortages [52]. Lower bore-<lb/>hole yields seasonally restrict groundwater-fed piped systems, while lower reservoir levels <lb/>seasonally affect piped networks drawing on surface waters [53]. Date of interview was <lb/>grouped into categories to align with the April-September dry season in 2018/19 [54] (dry <lb/>season: &apos;September 2018&apos;; &apos;July-August 2018&apos;, rainy season: &apos;October-November 2018&apos;; <lb/>&apos;December 2018-January 2019&apos;). <lb/>• Belonging to a minority ethnic group may restrict water access, since for example, locations <lb/>of public standpipes and household connections to mains services often disproportionately <lb/>favour majority ethnic groups [55]. Native language (English, Bemba, Lozi, Tonga, Kaonde/ <lb/>Lunda/Luvale or other) was therefore included as a proxy for ethnicity. <lb/>• Household size was included as it correlates with water consumption [51, 56], including <lb/>depletion rates of household stored water, ultimately affecting continuity. It also relates to <lb/>choice of service type [57, 58]. <lb/>• Home ownership relates to the choice of water service and ability to cope with piped water <lb/>interruptions. For example, home-owners can choose to invest in a water tank as an <lb/></body>

			<body>important coping strategy [59]. Home ownership as reported by the men&apos;s and women&apos;s <lb/>DHS questionnaire respondents was included. <lb/>At DHS household cluster level, we included the following variables: <lb/>• Degree of urbanisation (classified as: urban centres/cities; urban clusters/towns/suburbs; <lb/>rural localities; and unpopulated) was included as a systematic review found lower reported <lb/>availability in rural settings [15]. This DHS variable was derived from 2015 settlement data <lb/>from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project [60]. <lb/>• Since recently urbanised areas may have water infrastructure that has undergone develop-<lb/>ment and is less prone to maintenance-related interruptions, we included change in urbani-<lb/>sation (less urbanised; more urbanised; no change), based on the difference in GHSL <lb/>settlement class between 1990 and 2015. <lb/>• Neighbourhood wealth was included to reflect societal factors such as crime levels and disad-<lb/>vantaged communities [61], which in turn affect neighbourhood water infrastructure and <lb/>local capacity to cope with water intermittency. Cluster-level averages of the DHS&apos;s urban/ <lb/>rural wealth index were created. <lb/>• Newer neighbourhoods are less likely to have water infrastructure that is prone to failure, <lb/>due to general aging of materials and poor upkeep [11, 62] and neighbourhoods comprising <lb/>newly arrived migrants may lack sufficient social cohesion to lobby for services [63]. The <lb/>men&apos;s and women&apos;s DHS questionnaires ask respondents their length of residence in their <lb/>current home. As a proxy for the age of a cluster&apos;s neighbourhood and social cohesion, we <lb/>calculated the maximum length of residency for any men or women within a given cluster. <lb/>Water service provider-level variables were as follows: <lb/>• Since local economic development affects investment in WASH infrastructure [46, 64], we <lb/>calculated GDP per capita at the service provider level. 2015 provincial GDP [65] data were <lb/>converted to GDP per capita using 2015 provincial population statistics [66] (S7 Table), esti-<lb/>mating this via areal interpolation for those service provider areas that did not match to pro-<lb/>vincial boundaries. <lb/>• Non-revenue water was included to account for leakage or illegal use of piped networks [40, <lb/>41]. 2017 IBNET data which comprised the difference between water supplied and water <lb/>sold that is &apos;lost&apos; before it reaches the consumer, expressed as a percentage of net water sup-<lb/>plied [39]. <lb/>• Provider and regulator availability-reported average service hours expressed as hrs/day <lb/>and LCPCD were used and treated as continuous variables. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Stata 16.1 was used for all analysis [67]. Initially, provider, regulator and user-reported avail-<lb/>ability were compared through scatter plots and calculation of Pearson&apos;s correlation coeffi-<lb/>cients. The LPCD measures reported by providers and the regulator were also assessed against <lb/>the WHO benchmark of �50 LPCD to estimate the proportion of population within each <lb/>PCA not meeting this benchmark. <lb/>Descriptive and bivariate analysis for the outcome and explanatory variables, and associated <lb/>95% confidence intervals (CIs) and chi-square tests, used household survey weights [68] and <lb/>accounted for the complex survey design. Collinearity and missingness were examined for the <lb/>explanatory variables. <lb/></body>

			<body>Comparison of a single-level unconditional model and a two-level variance components <lb/>model quantified the clustering in the dataset, confirming the appropriateness of multilevel <lb/>models. Households (level 1) were nested in household clusters (level 2). Two final models <lb/>were specified. Model 1 included significant household and household cluster level variables, <lb/>and accounted for provider-level variation using dummy variables, as the small number of <lb/>PCAs (&lt;25) made it inappropriate to include the PCA as a level [69]. Model 2 included signifi-<lb/>cant household, household cluster and provider explanatory variables. Backward elimination <lb/>with a significance threshold of p = 0.05 was used for both models and type of piped service <lb/>was retained as a control, despite not reaching this level of significance. An interaction term <lb/>was considered when a valid hypothesis existed and was subsequently deemed meaningful. <lb/>Survey weights were not used in the multilevel models, since the DHS only make weights avail-<lb/>able at the household level due to concerns about disclosure risk [70]. Therefore, they were <lb/>unavailable at the household cluster or provider level, as was required for this analysis. Lastly, <lb/>random effects were added to the two models to calculate the proportion of variance within <lb/>household clusters that could not be attributed to observed variables. <lb/>Issues of multicollinearity were found between regulator-and provider-reported LPCD or <lb/>service hours/day. Analysis found regulator and provider reporting for the same year (2017) to <lb/>be very similar for LPCD, and identical for hrs/day (see section entitled &apos;Data Sources and <lb/>Availability Metrics&apos;). Detailed analysis found a clear relationship between regulator LPCD in <lb/>2017 and 2018 (S2 Fig). LPCD was therefore used as the measure of availability. When com-<lb/>paring regulator and provider perspectives during initial descriptive analysis, 2017 data was <lb/>used for consistencies of the year. For all modelling however, to eliminate multicollinearity, <lb/>only 2018 regulator data was used as it matched the year of user-reported availability and <lb/>reflected the provider perspective. <lb/>Results <lb/>Comparison of provider, regulator and user availability <lb/>In 2017, regulator records for service continuity (hrs/day) perfectly matched the provider data <lb/>reported to IBNET. No utilities reported a continuous service for 24 hrs/day, with households <lb/>receiving piped water for 18.4 hrs/day on average. The regulator and providers reported simi-<lb/>lar quantities of water supplied (in LPCD). Reported quantities were positively correlated (r s = <lb/>0.86, p&lt;0.001), though higher average LPCD was reported by providers (S16 Table). <lb/>2018 regulator-reported service continuity (hrs/day) is associated with user-reported avail-<lb/>ability at PCA level (χ(4) = 56.04, p&lt;0.001). Where the regulator reported continuity of 20 <lb/>hrs/day, 54% of users reported interruptions. 2018 regulator LPCD and user-reported avail-<lb/>ability were associated (χ(9) = 220.63, p&lt;0.001), with evidence of a significant weak positive <lb/>correlation (r s = 0.05, p = 0.007). Where the regulator reported supplying �50 LPCD and sub-<lb/>sequently met the WHO benchmark, 55% of users reported an interruption to their supply. <lb/>User-reported availability by provider coverage areas <lb/>Overall, 47% (95% CI: 44%, 49%) of users reported experiencing at least one full day of inter-<lb/>ruptions in the two weeks prior to being surveyed in 2018. The proportion of households <lb/>reporting an interruption ranged from 77% (95% CI: 71%, 82%) in Kafubu WSC to 19% (95% <lb/>CI: 15%, 24%) in Lukanga WSC (S8 Table). Fig 3 shows 2018 user-reported availability along-<lb/>side regulator/provider-reported hrs/day. Only six of 177 household clusters had no household <lb/>reports of piped water interruptions. Lusaka WSC supplied piped drinking-water to 44% of <lb/>households in the sample. Southern WSC supplied a further 14% of sampled households. All <lb/>other WSCs provided drinking-water to between 2% and 9% of sampled households. <lb/></body>

Month of interview was sig-<lb/>nificantly associated with interruptions to drinking-water service (p&lt;0.05), as was native lan-<lb/>guage (p&lt;0.05). As expected, type of piped service was significantly associated with household <lb/>wealth (p&lt;0.01). 68% of households in the richest wealth quintile had a piped service into <lb/>their dwelling, compared to 2% in the poorest wealth quintile. 45% of those in the poorest <lb/>wealth quintile used a public standpipe/tap compared to less than 1% in the richest wealth <lb/>quintile. <lb/>At the household cluster level, only degree of urbanisation and maximum length of resi-<lb/>dency were significantly associated with interruptions (p&lt;0.01) (Table 2).

Differences in household interruptions between those <lb/>speaking the majority and minority language are consistent between each PCA. Households <lb/>interviewed in the drier months of July-August were more likely to report an interruption <lb/>than those interviewed in wetter December-January, regardless of PCA. <lb/>Some patterns of socioeconomic inequalities in households reporting an interruption may <lb/>be mediated by PCA characteristics. In urbanised PCAs, the gap between households speaking <lb/>the majority language that report an interruption, compared to the minority language, is nar-<lb/>rower than for less urbanised PCAs.

			<body>Multi-level logistic regression <lb/>Table 4 includes the multi-level logistic regression results for two models. Model 1 includes <lb/>selected household and household cluster factors that explain inequalities in piped-water inter-<lb/>ruptions with provider accounted for via dummy variables. Model 2 shows the association <lb/>between socioeconomic characteristics at the household, household cluster and provider-level <lb/>and the likelihood of households reporting an interruption. <lb/>When provider is accounted for in model 1, type of piped service is not significant, whereas <lb/>in model 2 it is. Households using a neighbour&apos;s water had 33% greater odds of reporting an <lb/>interruption than those with water piped to their dwelling (p&lt;0.1). In model 1, households <lb/>interviewed at the peak of the dry season had 1.91 times the odds of an interruption than those <lb/>interviewed in the middle of the rainy season (p&lt;0.05). In model 2, households interviewed <lb/>outside the wettest months of December-January had 2-3 times the odds of experiencing an <lb/>interruption (p&lt;0.05). <lb/>In both models, household ownership is significantly associated with experiencing an inter-<lb/>ruption. The odds of experiencing an interruption were 1.31-1.32 times higher for those that <lb/>at least partly owned their home (p&lt;0.001). Availability of services varies significantly with <lb/>household native language. In both models, those who speak Luvale/Kaonde/Lunda have <lb/>greater odds of experiencing an interruption than English speaking households (p&lt;0.05). <lb/>When accounting for provider, compared to English speaking households, Tonga speakers <lb/>were 1.78 times more likely to have an interruption (p&lt;0.1) whereas in model 2, Bemba speak-<lb/>ing households had 1.88 time the odds (p&lt;0.1). <lb/>Households in neighbourhoods classed as having mid-level wealth had 4.31 times the odds <lb/>of experiencing an interruption than those in poor neighbourhoods (p&lt;0.01) (model 2). <lb/>Neighbourhood wealth was found to interact with regulator-reported service availability. <lb/>Compared to poor clusters, for every one litre increase in regulator reported LPCD, house-<lb/>holds in mid-wealth clusters had 3% lower odds of reporting an interruption (p&lt;0.05). <lb/>GDP per capita is the only provider-level factor associated with household availability <lb/>(model 2). For each $1000 increase in GDP per capita, the odds of reporting an interruption <lb/>are 0.51 times less (p&lt;0.01). GDP per capita at service provider level interacts with regulator-<lb/>reported LPCD. For every one unit increase in regulator-reported LPCD and GDP per capita <lb/>at service provider level, the odds of having an interruption were 1.02 times greater (p&lt;0.01). <lb/>Substantial variations between providers are evident when controlling for home ownership, <lb/>type of piped service, month of interview and native language (model 1). When comparing the <lb/>odds of households reporting an interruption to areas supplied by Lusaka WSC, households <lb/>supplied by Lukanga WSC had 64% lower odds of experiencing an interruption (p&lt;0.05) <lb/>whilst in Nkana the odds were 2.24 times higher (p&lt;0.05) and Mulongo WSC 3.77 times <lb/>higher (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, in Chambeshi WSC the odds of having an interruption were 2.43 <lb/>times higher (p&lt;0.05) and in Luapula they were 2.89 (p&lt;0.05). In Kafubu WSC, households <lb/>have eightfold increased odds of reporting experiencing an interruption than those whose pro-<lb/>vision is from Lusaka WSC (p&lt;0.01). <lb/>The variability in households&apos; likelihood of experiencing an interruption that was not <lb/>explained by the household and household cluster factors used in the multilevel models was exam-<lb/>ined through the Intra-Class Correlation (ICC). The ICC for model 1 shows that 27% of the <lb/>remaining unexplained variation in reported interruptions lies between household clusters, whilst <lb/>73% lies within household clusters. In model 2, 31% of the variation lies between clusters whereas <lb/>69% is within clusters. These results suggest that between a quarter and a third of the likelihood of <lb/>experiencing an interruption is related to the cluster that someone lives in, with the remainder <lb/>due to the specific household, after accounting for the variables within the models. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Insights into equalities in piped water continuity through integrated <lb/>analysis of survey, regulator, and provider data sets <lb/>Integrated analysis of utility, regulator, and household survey data provides some insights into <lb/>inequalities and risk factors for piped water continuity in urban Zambia that would not be <lb/>apparent from analysing any one data set in isolation. There are few statistically significant <lb/>inequalities at the household level (S17 Table, Model 2) and significant cluster-and provider-<lb/>level predictors. After controlling for household characteristics, this nationally representative <lb/>analysis of urban DHS data highlights provider-level inequality in service continuity (Fig 3) <lb/>[13]. 19% of households reported an interruption in Lukanga, compared to 77% in Kafubu <lb/>WSC (Table 1), with Kafubu, Mulongo, and several other WSCs having significantly higher <lb/>odds of household-reported interruptions relative to Lusaka after controlling for household <lb/>characteristics (Table 4). Similarly, a study [18] comparing DHS with IBNET for Peruvian <lb/>regions also found high inter-provider and inter-province intermittency, with lower house-<lb/>hold-reported intermittency in Lima, the capital, than most other regions. Whilst there is <lb/>some tentative evidence in our models that such provider-level variation in water continuity <lb/>may relate to utility operational indicators such as LPCD, this variation is also associated with <lb/>regional socio-economic variation such as in GDP per capita (Table 4). <lb/>Alongside provider-level patterns, variation in household-reported water continuity is evi-<lb/>dent at the household and household cluster level (Tables 2 &amp; 4). Regulatory reports and pro-<lb/>vider performance databases such as IBNET do not differentiate the level of service provided <lb/>to different household groups within their PCAs. However, it is known that ethnic minorities, <lb/>the poor, and other disadvantaged groups may receive poorer quality services [13]. In this <lb/>analysis, we integrated PCA boundaries with household survey data to examine such inequali-<lb/>ties. We find some evidence of urban inequalities in the availability of piped water services in <lb/>relation to ethnicity (measured via native language), home ownership and seasonality, but not <lb/>household wealth. We find no significant evidence that such inequalities vary between PCAs. <lb/>Key findings concerning household-and cluster-level risk factors were as follows: <lb/>• We found native English speakers less likely to report interruptions compared to respon-<lb/>dents speaking all other native languages. This could reflect the regional distribution of eth-<lb/>nicity in relation to service availability. Ethnicity is an important factor contributing to water <lb/>inequalities globally, with indigenous populations comprising 15% of the world&apos;s poor [1]. <lb/>• Households in mid-wealth clusters were less likely to experience an interruption than those <lb/>in poor clusters. This could reflect households in wealthier neighbourhoods adopting <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>protective measures against interruptions [10, 71] and having greater capacity to address ser-<lb/>vice network failures. <lb/>• Counter to our hypothesis, we found households who owned their home were more likely to <lb/>experience interruptions than those that did not. <lb/>• Households using a neighbour&apos;s piped water also had higher odds of experiencing an inter-<lb/>ruption than those with water piped to their dwelling. This could reflect household reluc-<lb/>tance to sell their water to neighbours during times of water scarcity. <lb/>• As suggested by other authors [18], reported water continuity varied seasonally, with house-<lb/>holds interviewed in peak rainy season having lower odds of reporting an interruption <lb/>(Tables 1 and 4). <lb/>Although multi-country analyses suggest exposure to microbially contaminated or inade-<lb/>quately chlorinated water is often greater among poorer households [72, 73], we found Zam-<lb/>bian households in both poor and wealthy clusters were more exposed to water interruptions <lb/>relative to those in mid-wealth clusters. Criteria concerning availability and water safety may <lb/>therefore affect socio-economic inequalities in access to safely managed water services. <lb/>Comparability and consistency of survey versus provider and regulatory <lb/>data <lb/>It is clear the data landscape is complex, which is exacerbated by the contrasting approaches to <lb/>measuring availability [14, 15]. The extent of our analysis has been limited due to the use of <lb/>two very different metrics of availability: regulator and provider reported yearly mean service <lb/>hours or LPCD, whilst DHS household survey respondents reported service interruptions in <lb/>the past fortnight. <lb/>Despite this, we find household survey reporting is correlated with provider/regulator <lb/>reporting (S17 Table). Differences existed between provider and regulator reporting depend-<lb/>ing on the metric in question, however generally they are highly consistent with one another <lb/>(S16 Table). This is as expected given NWASCO regulator reports use provider data, but the <lb/>use of regulator data is preferable for monitoring, given regulator independence from service <lb/>provision and incentives for providers to report higher service continuity [11]. <lb/>In linking household survey, regulator and provider data sets to evaluate their consistency, <lb/>we adopted a different approach to a previous study in Peru [18]. This study aggregated data <lb/>for PCAs to region level and compared household-and regulator-reported metrics at the <lb/>region level. In contrast, we used multi-level modelling to assess whether contextual provider-<lb/>or regulator-reported water continuity metrics were associated with household-level reports of <lb/>service interruptions. Our approach thus enables simultaneous evaluation of provider-level <lb/>versus household-level risk factors for supply interruptions, whilst avoiding the known prob-<lb/>lems of areal aggregation [74]. Particularly for larger service providers, our approach also pro-<lb/>vides insights into intra-provider socio-economic inequalities in access to an uninterrupted <lb/>water service via household reports collected independent of the service provider (Table 2). <lb/>Limitations affecting Zambia study <lb/>This analysis only captures household respondents who report an interruption of at least one <lb/>full day in the two weeks prior to being surveyed. As such, recall bias will likely exist in the <lb/>user data [75] whereby respondents may fail to remember or misremember interruptions in <lb/>their service. For example, respondents using a 2-week recall period systematically under-<lb/>reported child diarrhoea relative to a 1-week period [76]. Additionally, respondents who <lb/></body>

			<body>spend more time away from their homes may be unaware of short duration outages. Thus, <lb/>there are likely to be households who experience shorter-and longer-term service interrup-<lb/>tions, that are not captured in household survey data. Source of drinking-water and water used <lb/>for other purposes form inputs to the DHS wealth index, but not reported supply interrup-<lb/>tions. This complicates WASH inequality analyses [77] and could have increased collinearity <lb/>between the wealth index and source type in our models, but we did not find empirical evi-<lb/>dence for this. <lb/>The quality of provider and regulator data depends greatly on the accuracy of the data <lb/>reported by each WSC [14]. Data supplied by providers may be of limited reliability as they <lb/>may lack any form of independent verification [78]. <lb/>Between datasets, definitional differences existed in the classification of urban/rural areas <lb/>[31, 34]. Households were excluded based on the DHS urban/rural classification, despite the <lb/>regulator or provider potentially classifying them as urban. Additionally, given the DHS used a <lb/>2010 rural/urban classification [34, 79], it is likely that some rural areas may have become <lb/>urbanised. The issue of differing classifications is exacerbated by the use of GHSL population <lb/>data to create cluster-level locality and change in urbanisation variables. GHSL data uses a <lb/>finer spatial scale classification [80] that differs to the DHS classification. Thus, despite exclud-<lb/>ing all rural households from the analysis, inconsistencies between datasets are evident. For <lb/>both variables, some household clusters are classified as rural or unpopulated areas, despite the <lb/>DHS classifying them as urban. This could also be a result of the DHS&apos;s displacement of house-<lb/>hold cluster locations [35], though the effect is likely minimal as GPS clusters were not dis-<lb/>placed across province boundaries and WSCs are coincident with provinces. <lb/>The higher-level explanatory variables for wealth also have limitations. The neighbourhood <lb/>wealth variable was calculated by aggregating household-level DHS wealth index values to <lb/>household cluster level. This will however mean that closely located extreme differences in <lb/>wealth are unaccounted for. The provincial wealth variable used provincial GDP data that is <lb/>based on where industries produce their goods or where their head office is located. Therefore, <lb/>the data may not be a true representation of wealth in each PCA [65]. <lb/>Additional explanatory variables were considered for analysis, including &apos;voice&apos; [9], gender <lb/>of the person collecting water [81], storage tank ownership [82] and blue water scarcity [83]. <lb/>In all instances, inclusion was not possible as there was either no available data, limited vari-<lb/>ability across Zambia or reasonable proxies did not exist. <lb/>Barriers to methodological transferability <lb/>Our integrated analysis of household survey and water utility databases highlights data-related <lb/>barriers at present to methodological transferability at both international and national level. In <lb/>the context of Zambia, comparison has been made possible by a relatively simple data land-<lb/>scape, where PCAs largely coincide with DHS regions. At present, exploring inequalities else-<lb/>where via this methodology would only be possible in countries where household surveys have <lb/>measured service interruptions and for WSCs serving large populations, with known geo-<lb/>graphic coverage areas. Given that household survey cluster coordinates are randomly dis-<lb/>placed to preserve confidentiality [22], misallocation of households to providers is more likely <lb/>where PCAs are small. Thus, our approach is more suited to countries with several large-scale <lb/>water service providers, as opposed to countries dominated by small-scale providers or a single <lb/>national provider (e.g. Ghana Water Company Limited). Elsewhere, the availability of data <lb/>from all three streams is currently restricted to eastern and southern Africa (Fig 1 and S1 Fig; <lb/>S1-S3 Tables), but analysis will become possible in more countries as data availability <lb/>increases. By 2030, the data landscape may change considerably with greater availability of <lb/></body>

			<body>household survey data on water service continuity, from government via regulators, from utili-<lb/>ties as service providers and potentially other new forms of data such as via social media or <lb/>sensors [84]. Therefore, whilst the current transferability of methods is reliant on present-day <lb/>data availability, as monitoring expands, the applicability and transferability of this analysis <lb/>may broaden. <lb/>Within Zambia, data were only available for urban and peri-urban services from the pro-<lb/>vider and regulator, which limited the scope of this analysis to include only the urban and <lb/>peri-urban third of the Zambian population. Compared to user data which has national cover-<lb/>age, both datasets only include the population served by large-scale reporting commercial utili-<lb/>ties and may exclude services from small-scale private schemes/companies [85], micro-<lb/>operators managing delegated services [86], and community-managed piped services [18]. <lb/>Implications for international monitoring <lb/>The JMP only makes estimates for safely managed drinking-water when there are data avail-<lb/>able on water quality and at least one other element (accessibility or availability) that repre-<lb/>sents at least half of the population in question (e.g. country) [87]. The development of <lb/>methods which could help to reach this criterion threshold, for example by using data from <lb/>multiple perspectives, will be critical in better analysing WASH for international agendas such <lb/>as the SDGs. Improvements in data, coupled with a standardised process by which data are <lb/>processed to give nationally representative and internationally comparable insights into drink-<lb/>ing-water availability are needed, especially in order to understand inequalities between popu-<lb/>lation groups [16]. <lb/>Definitions of provider-reported average service hours requires further clarity. For exam-<lb/>ple, does it represent the hours a pump in a piped network is operated or the average duration <lb/>of service households receive? Several suggestions have been made to address this, such as reg-<lb/>ular random household surveys by providers or the use of sensors to detect outages [18]. At <lb/>present, provider reporting of hrs/day is unclear and it is unknown what the number of days <lb/>between service is. <lb/>We recommend further smaller scale studies of drinking-water availability. Whilst our anal-<lb/>ysis bears similarities to Rawas et al. [18] in its regional/provincial analysis, future work that <lb/>resonates more closely with Bellaubi et al.&apos;s [11] finer scale case study analysis would give <lb/>more detailed understanding of the availability of piped services. To achieve this, we recom-<lb/>mend providers and regulators report availability for smaller geographical units so that house-<lb/>holds can be better matched with provider jurisdictions. This would also be enhanced by <lb/>utilities providing their service areas as coverage area boundaries to IBNET to facilitate data <lb/>integration. Additionally, a future multi-country study could potentially explore other IBNET-<lb/>derived management indicators (e.g. concerning staff training or adequacy infra-structure <lb/>investment [88]) alongside those relating to service availability. However, care would be <lb/>needed to control for other regional covariates that could explain water service continuity, <lb/>such as regional GDP. <lb/>Greater uptake of the JMP&apos;s expanded WASH questions by national statistical agencies via <lb/>household surveys, such as the DHS, would facilitate further, more widespread evaluation of <lb/>regulator and provider data concerning water availability. Alongside the DHS question ana-<lb/>lysed in our study, these expanded questions also include asking households &apos;how many hours <lb/>per day is water supplied on average?&apos; [2]. Whilst uptake such questions depends on survey <lb/>implementation resources and national priorities [15], it would enable direct comparison with <lb/>regulator and provider reporting of service availability via a metric common to all data <lb/>sources. <lb/></body>

			<body>Conclusion <lb/>This study demonstrates the additional insights into risk factors associated with piped drink-<lb/>ing-water availability by incorporating utility and regulatory data into household survey analy-<lb/>sis for urban and peri-urban Zambia. At household and household cluster (neighbourhood) <lb/>level, when adjusting for confounders through multi-level modelling, inequalities are minimal. <lb/>Wealth was the only neighbourhood risk factor found to influence service availability. At the <lb/>household level, home ownership, month of interview, native language and type of service had <lb/>a modest effect. At provider-level, inequalities between PCAs were found in household report-<lb/>ing of interruptions to services. <lb/>Our analysis builds on existing assessments of drinking-water services [11, 18] by including <lb/>the additional perspective of the regulator. We find correlations between user, provider and <lb/>regulator reports of service availability, but direct comparison is difficult, due to variations in <lb/>availability metrics used. Limited data availability also restricts more widespread, integrated <lb/>analyses of these data in rural areas and across SSA. Moving forward, greater availability of <lb/>water service continuity data from all three data sources should enable assessment of socio-<lb/>economic and geographic inequalities in access to uninterrupted water services and potential <lb/>for understanding how water management indicators relate to household-related interruptions <lb/>in a wider set of countries. However, more widespread, integrated use of utility or regulator <lb/>data requires investment in government monitoring of intermittency in small-scale commu-<lb/>nity supplies to better understand rural service access. It also requires investment in utility cov-<lb/>erage area map layers to facility spatial data integration with household surveys. <lb/></body>
