			<body>Life Insurance Overview <lb/>A life insurance policy provides a cash payment when <lb/>a person dies. This payment is known as the death <lb/>benefit. Many people buy life insurance to protect the <lb/>people who are dependent on them. Others buy life <lb/>insurance as a way to leave a cash gift to their spouse, <lb/>children, grandchildren, and charities at their death. If <lb/>you have made the decision to buy a policy, you may <lb/>wonder which type of policy to choose since there are <lb/>several different types of policies. <lb/>The policy is written on the life of a person, known as the <lb/>insured. The owner makes payments, known as premi-<lb/>ums, to the insurance company for the policy. In return, <lb/>the insurance company agrees to pay the death benefit to <lb/>the beneficiary if the insured dies within the stated term. <lb/>Term <lb/>Term insurance is the most basic type of life insurance. <lb/>The policy is written for the term of the policy, usu-<lb/>ally from one to 30 years. If the insured dies within the <lb/>stated term, the insurance company pays the death ben-<lb/>efit to the beneficiary. When the term ends, the insur-<lb/>ance ends. The premiums for term insurance are usually <lb/>the lowest among the different types of life insurance, <lb/>but will increase with the age of the insured. There is <lb/>no cash value in a term life policy. (Cash value will be <lb/>discussed in greater detail later.) This means there is no <lb/>money for loans or to pay for the insurance if you can&apos;t <lb/>pay the premiums. <lb/>Many employers offer a type of term insurance known <lb/>as &quot;group&quot; term to their workers. Group policies cost <lb/>less, and many companies pay the premiums. Generally, <lb/>the policy is only good for as long as the worker stays <lb/>with the company. <lb/>Term insurance is suggested for those who only need <lb/>the death benefit for a certain period of time. See Life <lb/>Insurance: Term Insurance, Virginia Cooperative <lb/>Extension publication 354-144, for more information <lb/>on term insurance. <lb/>Whole-Life <lb/>A whole-life policy pays a death benefit no matter when <lb/>the insured dies. In most cases, the policy will guaran-<lb/>tee the death benefit. The premiums are usually much <lb/>higher than a term policy and the full premium must be <lb/>paid each year. Whole-life policies have cash value. The <lb/>difference between the premium and the actual cost of <lb/>the insurance is put into a special account, known as <lb/>the cash-value account. This cash-value account may <lb/>be used to help the insured pay the &quot;fixed&quot; premium <lb/>payments in later years. The policy owner may bor-<lb/>row against the cash value or receive the cash value <lb/>if the policy is canceled. There may be charges asso-<lb/>ciated with borrowing against the cash value or can-<lb/>celing the policy before the death of the insured. The <lb/>insurance company may charge interest if the money is <lb/>borrowed and fees to close out the account if the policy <lb/>is canceled. At death, the beneficiary only receives <lb/>the death benefit, not the death benefit and the cash <lb/>value. <lb/>Whole-life works well for those who want a guaranteed <lb/>death benefit no matter how long the insured lives, and <lb/>who have enough money to pay the premiums. See Life <lb/>Insurance: Whole-Life Insurance, Virginia Cooperative <lb/>Extension publication 354-145, for more information on <lb/>whole life. <lb/>

			Universal-Life <lb/>A universal-life policy is similar to a whole-life policy. <lb/>However, a universal-life policy gives the policy owner <lb/>the choice of changing the premium and even the death <lb/>benefit. <lb/>For example, the owner may decide to double the pre-<lb/>mium paid one year. The extra money will go in the <lb/>cash-value account. Most universal life policies have <lb/>cash-value accounts that pay at least 3 percent or 4 per-<lb/>cent interest. Another year, the owner may decide not <lb/>to pay any premium, and use money in the cash-value <lb/>account to pay the costs for that year. Policy owners <lb/>may have a higher death benefit while their children are <lb/>young, and a lower the death benefit once their children <lb/>are grown. <lb/>There are some limits to the changes that can be made. <lb/>The policy owner needs to be careful not to pay too <lb/>little, and end up with no cash value. If this happens, <lb/>and the owner still wants the insurance, he or she will <lb/>need to buy a new policy. Some policies allow the <lb/>beneficiary to receive both the death benefit and the <lb/>cash-value account at the death of the insured. Be <lb/>sure to read the policy closely as some only pay the <lb/>death benefit. <lb/>Universal-life works well for people who want lifetime <lb/>coverage with added flexibility. See Life Insurance: <lb/>Universal-Life Insurance, Virginia Cooperative <lb/>Extension publication 354-146, for more information <lb/>on universal life. <lb/>Variable Universal-Life <lb/>A variable universal-life policy is a special type of <lb/>universal policy. It allows the cash-value account to be <lb/>invested in stock funds, bond funds, and other assets <lb/>(much like mutual funds). These funds may allow <lb/>the cash value to grow at higher rates than fixed-rate <lb/>whole-life or universal-life policies. The down side is <lb/>that these funds may also have losses. Many variable <lb/>policies also offer a fixed account with a low guaran-<lb/>teed interest rate as one of the options. If the returns are <lb/>low (or negative) then the owner may need to pay more <lb/>premiums to keep the policy. <lb/>A variable universal-life policy is for people who <lb/>want lifetime coverage, and who can tolerate risk. The <lb/>buyer of a variable universal-life policy would prefer <lb/>to invest money in stocks and bonds to safer assets. <lb/>See Life Insurance: Variable Universal-Life Insurance, <lb/>Virginia Cooperative Extension publication 354-147, <lb/>for more information on variable life. <lb/>Insurance <lb/>Type <lb/>Premiums <lb/>Cash Value <lb/>Lifetime Coverage?
