			<front>Abstract <lb/>Background: Navigating the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 pandemic is challenging and ongoing critical appraisal of this output is essential. <lb/>We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus <lb/>disease (COVID-19). <lb/>Methods: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of <lb/>Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO&apos;s Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were <lb/>searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing <lb/>primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook <lb/>screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological <lb/>and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and <lb/>radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on <lb/>prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed. <lb/>Results: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR <lb/>2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as &quot;critically low&quot;, one as &quot;low&quot;, <lb/>one as &quot;moderate&quot; and two as &quot;high&quot;. Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of <lb/>point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea <lb/>(26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-<lb/>12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in <lb/>men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate <lb/>dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were <lb/>commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and <lb/>cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a <lb/>frequent pattern of uni-or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review <lb/>investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical <lb/>data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%. <lb/>Conclusions: Confidence in the results of most reviews was &quot;critically low&quot;. Future <lb/>studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The <lb/>majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy <lb/>and no previous protocol submission. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Background <lb/>Spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of <lb/>COVID-19, has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization <lb/>(WHO) and has triggered an international public health emergency [1]. The virus is <lb/>easily transmitted through person-to-person contact and virus contamination of surfaces <lb/>or objects [2,3]. As of April 7, 2020, more than 1,359,398 people have been confirmed <lb/>to be infected with the virus and over 75,945 people have died as a result of severe <lb/>complications of the disease [4]. These numbers are likely to be underestimates, as <lb/>countries are unable to test all patients suspected of having the disease due to worldwide <lb/>shortages of testing reagents [5]. Estimates put the economic impact of COVID-19 as <lb/>surpassing trillions of dollars when global trade, travel and business costs are added to <lb/>healthcare and public health expenses [6,7]. <lb/>Given the novelty of the situation and dozens of daily publications in peer reviewed <lb/>journals and preprints, there is an overwhelming avalanche of information from research <lb/>articles to sift through. For healthcare professionals and government policy makers, the <lb/>ability to sort through relevant research results, in order to clearly identify the most up-<lb/>to-date and reliable information, is essential. Having filtered, accurate information at <lb/>their disposal allows stakeholders to make timely decisions regarding the best course of <lb/>action. Hence, our aim was to summarize the data from all available systematic reviews <lb/>regarding COVID-19 in humans and to rigorously assess the level of confidence that we <lb/>can have in this evidence. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. Methodology <lb/>2.1. Protocol and Registration <lb/>This overview is a systematic review of systematic reviews. It is an extension of a <lb/>recently submitted PROSPERO protocol (CRD42020170623) [8]. The protocol has also <lb/>been published on Open Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.io/6xtyw) for <lb/>transparency. It was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for <lb/>Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [9]. The methodology <lb/>used in this review was adapted from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews <lb/>of Interventions and also followed established methodological considerations for <lb/>analyzing existing systematic reviews [10,11]. <lb/>2.2. Ethics <lb/>Approval of a research ethics committee was not necessary as the study analyzed only <lb/>publicly available articles. <lb/>2.3. Eligibility Criteria <lb/>Systematic reviews were included if they analyzed primary data from patients infected <lb/>with SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed by RT-PCR or another pre-specified diagnostic <lb/>technique. Eligible reviews covered all topics related to COVID-19, including, but not <lb/>limited to those that reported clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, therapeutic <lb/>interventions, laboratory findings or radiological results. Both full manuscripts and <lb/>abbreviated versions, such as letters, were eligible. <lb/>No restrictions were imposed on the design of the primary studies included within the <lb/>systematic reviews, date of last search, whether or not the review included meta-<lb/>analyses, or language. A systematic review was defined as a publication where: I. the <lb/>search was conducted in at least two databases (at least one being electronic); and II. <lb/>detailed description of the methods with explicit inclusion criteria was provided. We <lb/>excluded narrative reviews as these are less likely to be replicable and are more prone to <lb/>bias. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.4. Information Sources <lb/>Nine databases were searched for eligible records published between December 1 2019 <lb/>and March 24, 2020: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, <lb/>PubMed EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health <lb/>Literature), Web of Sciences, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences <lb/>Literature), PDQ-Evidence, WHO&apos;s Global Research on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-<lb/>19), and Epistemonikos. <lb/>2.5. Search <lb/>The comprehensive search strategy for each database is provided in Appendix 1 and <lb/>was designed and conducted in collaboration with an information specialist. All <lb/>retrieved records were primarily processed in EndNote, where duplicates were removed, <lb/>and records were then imported on Covidence Platform [12]. In addition to database <lb/>searches, we screened reference lists of reviews included, after screening records <lb/>retrieved via databases. <lb/>2.6. Study Selection <lb/>All searches, screening of titles and abstracts, as well as record selection, were <lb/>performed independently by two investigators using the Covidence Platform [12]. <lb/>Articles deemed potentially eligible were retrieved for full-text screening by two <lb/>independent investigators. Discrepancies in both stages of screening were resolved by <lb/>consensus. During screening, records published in languages other than English were <lb/>translated by a native/fluent speaker. <lb/>2.7. Data Collection Process <lb/>We custom designed a data extraction table for the purpose of this study, which was <lb/>piloted by two authors independently. Data extraction was performed independently by <lb/>two authors. Conflicts were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third researcher. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.8. Data Items <lb/>We extracted the following data: article identification data (authors&apos; name and journal <lb/>of publication), range of period associated with the search, number of databases <lb/>searched, population or settings considered, main results and outcomes observed, and <lb/>number of participants. From Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, <lb/>USA) we extracted journal rank (quartile) and Journal Impact Factor (JIF). <lb/>We categorized the following as primary outcomes: all-cause mortality, need for and <lb/>length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization (in days), admission to <lb/>intensive care unit (yes/no) and length of stay in intensive care unit. <lb/>The following were categorized as exploratory outcomes: diagnostic methods used for <lb/>detection of the virus, male to female ratio, clinical symptoms , pharmacological and <lb/>non-pharmacological interventions, laboratory findings (full blood count, liver enzymes, <lb/>C-reactive protein, d-dimer, albumin, lipid profile, serum electrolytes, blood vitamin <lb/>levels, glucose levels, and any other important biomarkers), and radiological findings <lb/>(using radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound). <lb/>We also collected data on reporting guidelines and requirements for publication of <lb/>systematic reviews and meta-analyses from journal websites where included reviews <lb/>were published <lb/>2.9. Quality Assessment in Individual Reviews <lb/>Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the reviews using the &quot;A <lb/>MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2)&quot;, designed to assess <lb/>systematic reviews that include both randomized and non-randomized studies. <lb/>Adherence to each item was rated as follows: yes, no, partial yes, not applicable or <lb/>unclear. We rated overall confidence in the results of the review as &quot;critically low&quot;, <lb/>&quot;low&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;high&quot;, according to the AMSTAR 2 guidance based on seven <lb/>critical domains defined by AMSTAR 2 authors [13]. If a review did not find any <lb/>studies to include (i.e., it was an ˝empty review˝), we scored each individual item, but <lb/>we did not conduct summary confidence assessment for such reviews. <lb/></body>

			<body>One of the included systematic reviews was conducted by some members of this author <lb/>team. To prevent risk of bias in assessing methodological quality of this particular <lb/>review, it was assessed independently by two authors who did not co-author it. <lb/>2.10. Synthesis of Results <lb/>For data synthesis, we prepared a table summarizing each systematic review. Graphics <lb/>illustrating mortality rate and clinical symptoms were created. We then prepared a <lb/>narrative summary of the methods, findings, study strengths and limitations. <lb/>For analysis of prevalence of clinical outcomes, we extracted data on the number of <lb/>events and total number of patients to perform proportional meta-analysis using <lb/>RStudio © software, with the &quot;meta&quot; package (version 4.9-6), using the &quot;metaprop&quot; <lb/>function for reviews that did not perform meta-analysis, excluding case studies because <lb/>of the absence of variance. For reviews that did not perform meta-analysis, we <lb/>presented pooled results of proportions with their respective confidence intervals (95%) <lb/>by the inverse variance method with a random-effects model, using the DerSimonian-<lb/>Laird estimator for τ 2 . We adjusted data using Freeman-Tukey double arcosen <lb/>transformation. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method <lb/>for individual studies. Forest plots were generated showing data from individual <lb/>systematic reviews, but results were not pooled because some studies were included in <lb/>multiple reviews. We developed the using RStudio © software, with the &quot;metafor&quot; <lb/>package (version 2.1-0) and &quot;forest&quot; function. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. Results <lb/>Our search retrieved 1,063 publications, of which 175 were duplicates. Most <lb/>publications were discarded after title and abstract analysis (n = 860), 28 were selected <lb/>for full text screening and 18 were included in the final analysis (Figure 1) [14-31]. <lb/>Reference list screening did not retrieve any additional systematic reviews. <lb/>3.1. Characteristics of included reviews <lb/>Summary features of the 18 systematic reviews are presented in Table S1. Included <lb/>reviews were published in 14 different journals. Only four of these journals had specific <lb/>requirements for submission of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis): <lb/>European Journal of Internal Medicine, Journal of Clinical Medicine, Ultrasound in <lb/>Obstetrics and Gynecology and Clinical Research in Cardiology. Two journals reported <lb/>that they published only invited reviews (Journal of Medical Virology and Clinica <lb/>Chimica Acta). Three reviews were published as a letter, and one was labelled as a rapid <lb/>review (Table S2). <lb/>All the reviews were published in English in a first quartile (Q1) journal, with JIF <lb/>(Journal Impact Factor) ranging from 1.692 to 6.062. The 18 systematic reviews <lb/>covered more than 120 individual primary studies, involving in total at least 60,000 <lb/>participants. Ten systematic reviews included meta-analyses. Primary studies included <lb/>in the reviews were published between December 2019 and March 18, 2020, and <lb/>comprised case reports, case series, cohorts and other observational studies. We did not <lb/>find any review with randomized clinical trials. In these reviews, systematic literature <lb/>searches were performed from 2019 (entire year) up to March 9, 2020. <lb/>3.2. Population and study designs <lb/>Most of the reviews analyzed data from patients with COVID-19 who developed <lb/>pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or any other correlated <lb/>complication. Two reviews were based on in vitro investigations, one review aimed to <lb/>evaluate the effectiveness of using surgical masks on preventing transmission of the <lb/>virus [25], one review was focused on pediatric patients [23] and one review <lb/></body>

			<body>investigated COVID-19 in pregnant women (Figure 1) [26]. Most reviews assessed <lb/>clinical symptoms, laboratory findings or radiological results. <lb/>3.3. Systematic review findings <lb/>The summary of findings from individual reviews is shown in Table S2. Overall, all-<lb/>cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14% (Figure 2). <lb/>3.3.1. Clinical symptoms <lb/>Seven reviews described the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 <lb/>[14,15,22,23,24,28,30]. Three of them provided only a narrative discussion of <lb/>symptoms [14,23,24]. Four reviews performed a statistical analysis of the incidence of <lb/>different clinical symptoms. Overall, symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were (range <lb/>values of the point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-<lb/>72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), <lb/>headache (8-12%), gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting <lb/>(5.0-9.0%), and others (including, in one study only: dizziness 12.1%) (Figure 3-9). <lb/>Three reviews assessed cough with and without sputum together; only one review <lb/>assessed sputum production itself (28.5%). <lb/>3.3.2. Diagnostic aspects <lb/>Three reviews described methodologies, protocols and tools used for establishing the <lb/>diagnosis of COVID-19 [14,23,27]. Use of respiratory swabs (nasal or pharyngeal) or <lb/>blood specimens to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using RT-PCR <lb/>assays was the most commonly used diagnostic methods mentioned in the included <lb/>studies. These diagnostic tests are widely used, but their precise sensitivity and <lb/>specificity remain unknown. One review included a Chinese study in which there was <lb/>clinical diagnosis with no confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (patients were <lb/>diagnosed with COVID-19 if they presented with at least 2 symptoms suggestive of <lb/>COVID-19, as well as laboratory and chest radiography abnormalities) [23]. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.3.3 Therapeutic possibilities <lb/>Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (supportive therapies) used in <lb/>the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were reported in five reviews <lb/>[16,17,23,24,27]. Most reviews were descriptive, as the original studies did not assess <lb/>the impact of therapies. Antivirals have been used empirically for COVID-19 treatment <lb/>with the most commonly used being protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir), <lb/>nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (tenofovir), nucleotide analog (remdesivir, <lb/>galidesivir, ganciclovir), and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). Umifenovir, a <lb/>membrane fusion inhibitor, was investigated in several studies [16,24]. Possible <lb/>supportive interventions analyzed were different types of oxygen supplementation and <lb/>breathing support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation). Use of antibiotics, both <lb/>empirically and to treat secondary pneumonia, was reported in some studies. One <lb/>review specifically assessed evidence on the efficacy and safety of the anti-malaria drug <lb/>chloroquine [17]. It identified 23 ongoing trials investigating the potential of <lb/>chloroquine as a therapeutic option for COVID-19, but no verifiable clinical outcomes <lb/>data. Use of mesenchymal stem cells, antifungals and glucocorticoids were seldom <lb/>described. <lb/>3.3.4 Laboratory and radiological findings <lb/>Of the 18 reviews included in this overview, eight analyzed laboratory parameters in <lb/>patients with COVID-19 [16,19-24,28]. Elevated C-reactive protein levels, associated <lb/>with lymphocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, as well as slightly elevated <lb/>aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST, ALT) were commonly described. Lippi et <lb/>al. assessed the variation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), procalcitonin, and platelet count <lb/>between severe COVID-19 patients and non-severe COVID-19 patients [19-21]. <lb/>Elevated levels of procalcitonin and cTnI were more likely to be associated with a <lb/>severe disease course (requiring intensive care unit admission and intubation). <lb/>Furthermore, thrombocytopenia was frequently observed in patients with complicated <lb/>COVID-19 infections. <lb/>Chest imaging (chest radiography and/or computed tomography) features were assessed <lb/>in six reviews, all of which described a frequent pattern of local or bilateral multilobar <lb/>ground-glass opacity [16,23,24,28-30]. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural and <lb/></body>

			<body>cardiac effusions, halo signs and pneumothorax were observed in patients suffering <lb/>from COVID-19. <lb/>3.4 Quality of evidence in individual systematic reviews <lb/>Table S3 shows the detailed results of the quality assessment of 18 systematic reviews, <lb/>including assessment of individual items and summary assessment. Overall confidence <lb/>in results of reviews was assessed for 17 reviews; for one empty review summary <lb/>assessment was not made [25]. Using AMSTAR 2 criteria, confidence in the results of <lb/>13 out of 17 reviews with included studies was rated as &quot;critically low&quot;, one as &quot;low&quot;, <lb/>one as &quot;moderate&quot; and two as &quot;high&quot;. Common methodological drawbacks were: <lb/>omission of prospective protocol submission or publication; use of inappropriate search <lb/>strategy: lack of independent and dual literature screening and data-extraction (or <lb/>methodology unclear); absence of explanation for heterogeneity among the studies <lb/>included; lack of reasons for study exclusion (or rationale unclear). <lb/>Risk of bias assessment, based on a clearly reported methodological tool, and quality of <lb/>evidence appraisal, in line with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, <lb/>Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, were reported only in one review. 16 <lb/>Systematic reviews should perform a risk of bias assessment of included primary <lb/>studies, but only five (27.7%) of the included reviews presented a table summarizing <lb/>bias. Review authors used a varied number of risk of bias tools. Of these, four reviews <lb/>classified studies as being of ˝fair˝ or ˝appropriate quality˝ and one review classified <lb/>studies as having a high risk of bias. One review mentioned the risk of bias assessment <lb/>in the methodology but did not provide any related analysis. It is worth mentioning that <lb/>the reviews used a varied amount of risk of bias tools. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Discussion <lb/>This overview of systematic reviews, to our knowledge the first of its kind on COVID-<lb/>19, included 18 reviews published up to March 24, 2020, and involving more than <lb/>60,000 patients. Ten reviews included meta-analyses. The reviews presented data on <lb/>clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings and interventions. We <lb/>found no systematic reviews on the utility of diagnostic tests. <lb/>Symptoms were reported in seven reviews; the majority of the patents had fever, cough, <lb/>dyspnea, myalgia or muscle fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, <lb/>nausea or vomiting. Olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or dysosmia) has been reported in <lb/>the scientific literature to occur in some patients infected with COVID-19 but this was <lb/>not reported in any of the assessed systematic reviews [32,33,34]. During the SARS <lb/>outbreak in 2002, there were reports of impairment of sense of smell associated with the <lb/>disease [35,36]. Nasal obstruction and post-viral olfactory disorders are possible reasons <lb/>for this symptom [37]. <lb/>The reported mortality rates ranged from 0.3 to 14% in the included reviews. Mortality <lb/>estimates are influenced by the transmissibility rate (basic reproduction number), <lb/>availability of diagnostic tools, notification policies, asymptomatic presentations of the <lb/>disease, resources for disease prevention and control and treatment facilities. Even with <lb/>more than 1,359,398 people infected as of April 7, 2020 [4], variability in the mortality <lb/>rate fits the pattern of emerging infectious diseases [38]. Furthermore, the reported cases <lb/>do not consider asymptomatic cases, mild cases where individuals have not sought <lb/>medical treatment, and the fact that many countries have limited access to diagnostic <lb/>tests or have implemented testing policies only very recently [39]. The lack of reviews <lb/>assessing diagnostic testing (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of RT-PCT or <lb/>immunoglobulin tests), and the preponderance of studies that assessed only <lb/>symptomatic individuals, means that considerable imprecision remains around the <lb/>calculated mortality rate. <lb/>Few reviews included treatment data. Those that did described studies offering a very <lb/>low level of evidence: usually small, retrospective studies with very heterogenous <lb/>populations. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions therefore remains extremely <lb/>unclear. Encouragingly, on April 7, 2020 there were 366 clinical trials for COVID-19 <lb/>registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, with many pharmacological interventions being tested, <lb/>so hopefully this gap in the evidence will be filled soon [40]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Seven reviews analyzed laboratory parameters. Elevated CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, <lb/>AST and ALT were commonly reported; elevated cTnI and procalcitonin, and lower <lb/>platelet count, appear to be associated with more severe disease. This information may <lb/>be useful for clinicians who attend patients suspected of COVID-19 in emergency <lb/>services worldwide, for example, to assess which patients need to be reassessed more <lb/>frequently. Further research is required to assess their relation to mortality and other <lb/>patient outcomes, as well as prognosis, in order to investigate whether they can <lb/>contribute to decision-making. <lb/>Most systematic reviews scored poorly on the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool for <lb/>systematic reviews. Thirteen of the 17 included reviews achieved the lowest rating of <lb/>&quot;critically low&quot; in the confidence readers can have in the results of the review. In <lb/>contrast, only two reviews achieved the top rating of &quot;high&quot; confidence in the results. <lb/>Most of the original studies included in the reviews were case series and case reports, <lb/>which impacts on the quality of evidence. This has major implications for clinical <lb/>practice and use of these reviews in evidence-based practice and policy. Clinicians, <lb/>patients and policymakers can only have the highest confidence in systematic review <lb/>findings if high-quality systematic review methodologies are employed. The urgent <lb/>need for information during a pandemic does not justify poor quality reporting. <lb/>A limitation of our study is that for AMSTAR 2 assessment we relied on information <lb/>available in publications; we did not attempt to contact study authors for clarifications <lb/>or additional data. Appraisal of methodological quality of three reviews was hindered <lb/>because they were published as letters, labelled as rapid communications. As a result, <lb/>various details about their review process were not included, leading to AMSTAR 2 <lb/>questions being answered as not reported and thus to low confidence scores. Full <lb/>manuscripts might have provided additional information that could have led to higher <lb/>confidence in the results. In other words, low scores could reflect incomplete reporting, <lb/>not necessarily low quality review methods. In seeking to make their review available <lb/>more rapidly and more concisely, methodological details may have been omitted. This <lb/>reflects a general issue during a crisis where speed and completeness must be balanced. <lb/>Given that some included reviews scored &quot;high&quot;, the two factors are not mutually <lb/>exclusive. However, this requires proper resourcing and commitment to ensure users of <lb/>systematic reviews can have high confidence in the results. <lb/></body>

			<body>Despite this limitation, this overview adds to the current knowledge by providing a <lb/>comprehensive summary of all the currently available evidence about COVID-19 from <lb/>published systematic reviews. This overview followed strict methodological criteria, <lb/>including a comprehensive and sensitive search strategy and a standard tool for <lb/>methodological appraisal of systematic reviews. Another potential limitation is that <lb/>several authors from this study have contributed to one of the reviews identified. To <lb/>reduce risk of any bias, two authors who did not contribute to the review in question <lb/>undertook the assessment of its quality and limitations. <lb/>Further research is of the utmost importance to assess the impact of antivirals, <lb/>chloroquine and other interventions on patient outcomes. Additionally, it is essential to <lb/>determine the accuracy of available diagnostic tests. Understanding the role of different <lb/>biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes, and whether they could be used in association <lb/>with validated scores, such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, to <lb/>help the decision of choosing patients for scarce intensive care unit beds would be very <lb/>useful. <lb/>5. Conclusion <lb/>In conclusion, by conducting this overview of systematic reviews, we have quantified <lb/>the overall incidence of clinical manifestations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>and described its more common laboratory and radiological abnormalities. The evidence <lb/>is sufficient to guide medical doctors and health-related professionals on the <lb/>construction of clinical rationale of non-tested cases, but insufficient to provide any <lb/>specific endorsement of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In <lb/>order to fill evidence-based gaps, high quality primary studies should be carried out <lb/>initially, so that well-designed systematic reviews can be performed in the future. <lb/></body>

Epidemiological findings showed that both the immunosuppressed and normal population appear <lb/>susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Biological analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to β coronaviruses found in bats. The effective reproductive <lb/>number of SARS-CoV-2 (2.9) is higher than that of SARS (1.77). Virus transmission originated in Wuhan and from there it spread internationally. It is likely to <lb/>be transmitted from human-to-human contact (via droplets or aerosol) as well as via surface contact. Prevention and control consist of isolation, identification and <lb/>follow-up of contacts, environmental disinfection, and use of personal protective equipment. <lb/>Clinical Symptoms <lb/>The most commonly reported clinical symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, pneumonia, and complicated dyspnea, whereas less commonly <lb/>reported symptoms include headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, runny nose, and phlegm producing cough. Patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after <lb/>1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus, which may lead to death. <lb/>Diagnosis <lb/>Diagnosis of suspected cases used real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) to detect the positive nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, throat swabs, and <lb/>secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples. <lb/>Not available <lb/>Critically Low <lb/>Early scoping report. <lb/>Broad range of topics <lb/>addressed. <lb/>Good review methods, <lb/>incompletely reported. <lb/>Narrative presentation <lb/>of many results. <lb/>Bo et al <lb/>15 <lb/>Comorbidities evaluated <lb/>The most prevalent comorbidities among confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hypertension (17.1%), cardiocerebrovascular disease (16.4%) and diabetes <lb/>(9.7%). Patients with severe disease/in ICU were more likely to have hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes than patients with non-severe <lb/>disease/not in ICU; 8.0% of patients with COVID-19 suffered acute cardiac injury. Incidence of myocardial injury was ~13 times higher in patients with severe <lb/>disease/in ICU than patients with non-severe disease/not in ICU. <lb/>Not available <lb/>Critically Low <lb/>Addresses important <lb/>comorbidity. <lb/>Good review methods, <lb/>incompletely reported. <lb/>Borges do <lb/>Nascimento et al <lb/>16 <lb/>General summary <lb/>All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%-1.0%). Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients. <lb/>Clinical Symptoms <lb/>The incidence of symptoms were shown as following: Fever 82%, (CI) 56%-99%; Cough 61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; Muscle aches and/or fatigue 36%, 95% <lb/>CI 18%-55%; Dyspnea 26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; Headache 12%, 95% CI 4%-23%; Sore throat 10%, 95% CI 5%-17% and gastrointestinal symptoms 9%,95% <lb/>CI 3%-17%. <lb/>Laboratory findings <lb/>Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 10 9 /L, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 × 10 9 /L and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54-<lb/>45.91mg/dL. <lb/>Radiological findings <lb/>Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation. <lb/>Therapeutic findings <lb/>Antivirals (oseltamivir, umifenovir, ganciclovir, ritonavir) were reported as the most commonly used agents. Use of antibiotics was also reported <lb/>(vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, cefaclor, cefepime and tazobactam).
