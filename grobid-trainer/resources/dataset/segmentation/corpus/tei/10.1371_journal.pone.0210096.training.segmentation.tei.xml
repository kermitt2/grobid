			<body>Introduction <lb/>In recent years, the HIV cascade has become an important framework for monitoring HIV <lb/>care, identifying gaps and informing/evaluating appropriate interventions [1]. The HIV cas-<lb/>cade refers to the components of HIV diagnosis and care that people living with HIV (PLWH) <lb/>progress through to achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load (VL). These components <lb/>include testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in medical care, and initiation of and <lb/>adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) [2]. With recent evidence supporting earlier initi-<lb/>ation of ART to improve individual health and prevent HIV transmission to a partner [3,4], <lb/>as well as a growing interest in the use of ART to reduce HIV incidence at a population-level <lb/>[5-7], HIV policy and programming has increasingly focused on measuring and improving <lb/>engagement in the HIV cascade. Indeed, the cascade framework has become the basis of sev-<lb/>eral regional, national and international HIV policies, including the recent UNAIDS 90-90-90 <lb/>strategy which calls for 90% of people living with HIV (PLWH) to be diagnosed, 90% of diag-<lb/>nosed PLWH to be on ART, and 90% of PLWH on ART to be virally suppressed by 2020 [8]. <lb/>Although relatively simple in concept, there are several methodological challenges to <lb/>measuring the cascade in ways that are representative of and comparable across jurisdictions <lb/>[9-14]. These challenges include the lack of standardized cascade metrics, as well as limitations <lb/>inherent to the varied data sources available. To understand and overcome these challenges, <lb/>Medland and co-authors published a systematic review of cascade studies in 2015 [15]. In <lb/>addition to proposing standardized metrics, the authors identified only six jurisdictions world-<lb/>wide with optimal cascades; that is, &quot;broad&quot; cascades (i.e. include data on the number of <lb/>infected/diagnosed PLWH through to the number suppressed) [10] constructed from popula-<lb/>tion-based data sources (i.e. individual-level data collected across an entire population). These <lb/>jurisdictions included New York City [16], King County in Washington State [17], British <lb/>Columbia (BC) [18], Denmark [19], Georgia [20] and a study of 18 states and the District of <lb/>Columbia representing approximately 40% of diagnosed PLWH in the US [21]. Further, only <lb/>one of these studies used a cohort-based approach, which is optimal for longitudinal cascade <lb/>measurement [10]. Instead, most published cascade analyses use clinical cohorts of PLWH <lb/>who have already entered care and thus cannot be used to construct &quot;broad&quot; cascades [22-25], <lb/>or extrapolate from non-population-based data sources and thus lack individual-level linkage <lb/></body>

			<body>from diagnosis to suppression (i.e. conduct analyses at the aggregate level) [26-30]. The lack of <lb/>optimal data sources/approaches [10,15] means that accurate and comprehensive knowledge <lb/>across the full continuum of care may be lacking for most jurisdictions worldwide. <lb/>Analysis of the HIV cascade in Ontario-Canada&apos;s largest province (population 14.0 mil-<lb/>lion) [31]-has been limited. Ontario has experienced the greatest burden of HIV in the coun-<lb/>try and about 40% of the ~80,000 HIV cases between 1985 and 2016 in Canada were <lb/>diagnosed in Ontario [32,33]. In 2016, the HIV diagnosis rate per 100,000 people in Ontario <lb/>(6.3) was comparable to the national average (6.4) [33]. Despite an overall decrease in the rate <lb/>of HIV diagnoses and mortality among PLWH over time [34,35], approximately 800 to 900 <lb/>HIV infections continue to be diagnosed in Ontario each year [34] and mortality remains <lb/>higher for PLWH than the general population [35]. These data suggest there is room for <lb/>improvement in HIV prevention and treatment in Ontario, and the provincial HIV/AIDS <lb/>strategy launched in 2018 prioritizes cascade measurement to guide and evaluate HIV policy <lb/>and programming [36]. However, analyses of cascade components to date have mostly been <lb/>limited to a clinical cohort following approximately 25-30% of PLWH actively receiving medi-<lb/>cal care in the province [37], as well as a population-based administrative cohort of PLWH <lb/>who have entered care that lacks information on viral suppression-a key component of the <lb/>cascade [35,38,39]. While both of these data sources have important strengths, they are not <lb/>optimal for assessing the full continuum of care at the level of Ontario&apos;s population. <lb/>To improve our understanding of Ontario&apos;s cascade, we created a population-based cohort <lb/>of diagnosed PLWH (referred to as the Ontario HIV Laboratory Cohort) using a centralized <lb/>laboratory database with HIV diagnostic and viral load (VL) test records linked at the individ-<lb/>ual-level. In this paper, we assess cascade indicators over time and by sex and age among diag-<lb/>nosed PLWH in the Ontario HIV Laboratory Cohort. Our primary objectives were to measure <lb/>trends in the annual proportion of diagnosed PLWH who were in care, on ART and virally <lb/>suppressed. We also aimed to measure time from diagnosis to linkage to care and viral sup-<lb/>pression among individuals who were newly diagnosed with HIV in Ontario. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Setting <lb/>Ontario is Canada&apos;s most populous province [31]. Access to medically necessary services <lb/>(including HIV medical care visits and laboratory testing) are free for those living in Ontario <lb/>who are eligible (e.g. Canadian citizens, permanent residents) and registered with the prov-<lb/>ince&apos;s health care plan. However, in Ontario, there is no universal coverage of ART medica-<lb/>tions. Individuals can obtain coverage through private health insurance or may be eligible for <lb/>government-sponsored programs [40]. However, private and public coverage is not always full <lb/>and often requires some form of payment to cover deductibles/co-payments [41]. <lb/>Data sources <lb/>Public Health Ontario Laboratory HIV datamart and Ontario HIV Laboratory <lb/>Cohort. The Ontario HIV Laboratory Cohort is a retrospective, population-based cohort of <lb/>diagnosed PLWH in Ontario, Canada. This cohort was created using the HIV datamart at <lb/>Public Health Ontario Laboratory (PHOL). The HIV datamart and creation of the Ontario <lb/>HIV Laboratory Cohort are described below. <lb/>The HIV datamart was developed using HIV clinical laboratory databases housed at PHOL. <lb/>All HIV diagnostic and VL testing conducted by health care providers in Ontario is done by <lb/>PHOL. Centralized databases contain information on test results and information docu-<lb/>mented by the ordering provider on test requisition/surveillance forms. The diagnostic test <lb/></body>

			<body>requisition collects information on sex, age and HIV exposure category while the VL test req-<lb/>uisition collects information on sex, age, ART medications and most recent CD4 count. A fol-<lb/>low-up surveillance form (the Laboratory Enhancement Program, LEP, questionnaire) is sent <lb/>to an ordering provider if a diagnostic test result is HIV-positive in order to collect further <lb/>information on the diagnosed individual. This includes information collected on the diagnos-<lb/>tic test requisition (e.g. exposure category), as well as information not collected on the requisi-<lb/>tion (e.g. race/ethnicity and country of birth). The LEP form was introduced in 1999 and race/ <lb/>ethnicity and country of birth were added to the questionnaire in 2009. The previously sepa-<lb/>rate diagnostic and VL databases were recently integrated by Public Health Ontario and rec-<lb/>ords linked at the individual-level to create a single population-based data source (hereafter <lb/>referred to as the &quot;HIV datamart&quot;). Of note, the majority of HIV diagnostic testing in Ontario <lb/>is conducted nominally (i.e. using the name of the person tested), although non-nominal <lb/>forms of testing (i.e. using anonymous or coded identifiers) are permitted. VL testing in <lb/>Ontario is conducted as part of routine care for people already diagnosed with HIV. While <lb/>anonymous VL testing has been permitted as of July 1 st 2015, all VL tests in the database were <lb/>nominal as of the end of 2015. <lb/>We used the HIV datamart to create a cohort of diagnosed PLWH in Ontario for retrospec-<lb/>tive measurement of cascade indicators. Individuals in the datamart enter the cohort with first <lb/>record of a nominal HIV-positive diagnostic test or VL test. Non-nominal HIV-positive diag-<lb/>noses are excluded due to insufficient identifying information to allow linkage to other diag-<lb/>nostic/VL tests (thus precluding the ability to identify possible duplication in the nominal <lb/>data, as well as measure subsequent engagement in care). However, while non-nominal tests <lb/>are excluded, individuals diagnosed non-nominally enter the cohort when they link to care <lb/>and receive a nominal VL test. As such, individuals with a VL test only (no linked HIV-positive <lb/>diagnostic test) are included in the cohort to capture individuals diagnosed non-nominally, as <lb/>well as previously diagnosed individuals migrating into the province. All individuals who enter <lb/>the cohort are defined as a person with diagnosed HIV. <lb/>Individuals in the cohort remain unless administratively lost-to-follow up (LTFU), <lb/>defined as having had no VL test for &gt;2 consecutive years and no VL test in later years. <lb/>The LTFU rule was applied to indirectly censor for death and migration out of the province <lb/>(out-migration), as this information was lacking from our laboratory databases. Importantly, <lb/>participants assessed as LTFU are not permanently censored and, as time progresses, these <lb/>individuals can re-enter the cohort with subsequent record of a VL test. We selected 2 years <lb/>for the LTFU criteria given that this would capture most individuals experiencing a known <lb/>gap in care in our cohort (i.e. no VL test in �1 year but record of a VL test in a later year). The <lb/>duration of this LTFU criteria is similar to what has been used elsewhere [18,37]. We define <lb/>cohort individuals who are not LTFU as diagnosed people living with HIV (PLWH) in <lb/>Ontario. <lb/>Newly diagnosed sample. We also used the datamart to create a subset of individuals <lb/>who were newly diagnosed with HIV in Ontario (i.e. were not initially diagnosed elsewhere <lb/>and then moved to Ontario) in order to measure longitudinal cascade indicators (i.e. time <lb/>from diagnosis to linkage to care and viral suppression). This newly diagnosed subset includes <lb/>individuals with record of a nominal HIV-positive diagnostic test and excludes individuals <lb/>with 1) a VL test only (i.e. no linked HIV-positive diagnostic test-as this precludes measure-<lb/>ment of time from HIV diagnosis) and 2) evidence of having received an HIV-positive diagno-<lb/>sis prior to their first nominal HIV-positive diagnostic test record in Ontario (i.e. record of a <lb/>CD4 or detectable VL test before diagnosis, or a first VL test after diagnosis that was <lb/>suppressed). <lb/></body>

			<body>contrast to Medland et al [15], we used the term &quot;in care&quot; instead of &quot;retention in care&quot;, as <lb/>we felt this is more reflective of what the indicator is measuring (i.e. while our dataset is <lb/>longitudinal, the measure of �1 VL test in a given year is cross-sectional in nature and <lb/>doesn&apos;t track an individual&apos;s retention longitudinally). In addition to the elements recom-<lb/>mended by Medland et al, we also measured time from diagnosis to viral suppression, as <lb/>done by others [42,43]. While linkage to care is defined as the percent of individuals who <lb/>linked to care within 3 months of diagnosis [15], there is no recommended threshold for time <lb/>from diagnosis to suppression. In the presentation of our results, we focus on the percent sup-<lb/>pressed within 6 months. Of note, the national HIV/AIDS strategy in the United States short-<lb/>ened the threshold for their linkage to care indicator from 3 months to 1 month in 2015 [44]. <lb/>Therefore, we also include the proportion linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis in respec-<lb/>tive figures. <lb/>Medland et al recommend that cascade indicators be presented as both the percent of all <lb/>PLWH in a jurisdiction (diagnosed and undiagnosed) as well as all diagnosed PLWH [15]. In <lb/>our analysis, we only present cascade indicators as the percent of diagnosed PLWH, as the <lb/>total HIV-infected population in the province was not measurable in our cohort and modeling <lb/>estimates over this time period are currently under development in Ontario. To quantify attri-<lb/>tion at each cascade step and facilitate comparison to the third UNAIDS 90-90-90 estimate, we <lb/>also calculated conditional estimates of those &quot;on ART&quot; and &quot;virally suppressed&quot; by limiting <lb/>the denominator to individuals who had already achieved the previous indicator(s) (i.e. were <lb/>already &quot;in care&quot; or &quot;on ART&quot;). <lb/>For each cascade indicator, we created a &quot;main&quot; definition based on the most commonly <lb/>used and recommended approach. In keeping with recommendations to present a range of <lb/>plausible estimates (as opposed to what may be artificially precise single estimates) [14], we <lb/>also calculated &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; bounds. These upper/lower bounds were calculated using <lb/>alternative assumptions/definitions for each indicator, where possible. Alternative assump-<lb/>tions/definitions were employed to improve our ability to compare across studies (as there is <lb/>no consistent standard for cascade metrics across the literature) and to accommodate possible <lb/>biases due to inherent aspects unique to our data source. Of note, for our alternative (&quot;upper&quot;) <lb/>definition of the number of diagnosed PLWH (cohort individuals not LTFU), we altered our <lb/>eligibility criteria to include non-nominal HIV-positive diagnoses and extended the LTFU cri-<lb/>teria from two to three years. We used this &quot;upper&quot; diagnosed PLWH definition in the denom-<lb/>inator to calculate &quot;lower&quot; estimates of the percent &quot;in care&quot;, &quot;on ART&quot; and &quot;virally <lb/>suppressed&quot;. For our main definition of &quot;virally suppressed&quot;, we used the most recent VL test <lb/>in a given year, which is the approach most commonly used [16,17,21] and recommended [45] <lb/>by others, but is not specified by Medland et al [15]. <lb/>Our &quot;on ART&quot; indicator was based on documentation of specific antiretroviral medications <lb/>by the ordering provider on VL test requisition forms. This information was missing for <lb/>approximately 17-20% of requisitions each year. To address these missing data in our analysis, <lb/>we made conservative assumptions regarding ART status (i.e. on or off ART) for requisitions <lb/>with missing information. In order to calculate conservative estimates, our assumptions dif-<lb/>fered depending on whether &quot;on ART&quot; was used in the numerator or denominator of the indi-<lb/>cator calculated. When &quot;on ART&quot; was in the numerator (to calculate the percent of diagnosed <lb/>PLWH who were on ART), requisitions missing information were only assumed to be on ART <lb/>if the VL was suppressed. When &quot;on ART&quot; was in the denominator (to calculate the percent of <lb/>PLWH on ART who were suppressed), all requisitions with missing ART information were <lb/>assumed to be on ART. <lb/></body>

			<body>Analysis <lb/>We restricted our analyses to the period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015. Although <lb/>VL testing was implemented in 1996, it took several years to become a routine part of HIV <lb/>care and thus serve as an accurate proxy for linkage to and engagement in care [46]. <lb/>We used data from the Ontario HIV Laboratory Cohort to measure trends in the annual <lb/>percent of diagnosed PLWH who were in care, on ART and virally suppressed, as well as con-<lb/>ditional estimates for the on ART and virally suppressed indicators. Cohort participants were <lb/>included in the analyses of annual cascade measures until administratively LTFU. Individuals <lb/>were assumed to be off ART and unsuppressed if they did not have a VL test in a given year. <lb/>Individuals who re-entered the cohort after being LTFU were counted as being a diagnosed <lb/>PLWH who did not meet any of the cascade indicator definitions for the years in which they <lb/>were LTFU. <lb/>We used data from the newly diagnosed subset to measure trends in the annual percent of <lb/>newly diagnosed individuals who linked to care within three months of diagnosis (i.e. linkage <lb/>to care) and achieved viral suppression within six months of diagnosis. Among those with <lb/>record of a VL test or suppressed VL, we also calculated the median number of days from diag-<lb/>nosis-to-care and diagnosis-to-suppression, respectively. To minimize truncation bias, we <lb/>excluded individuals newly diagnosed in 2015 from the diagnosis-to-care analyses and those <lb/>diagnosed in 2014 and 2015 from the diagnosis-to-suppression analyses, given that individuals <lb/>diagnosed in these years may not have had sufficient time to reach these endpoints by end of <lb/>2015. <lb/>We assessed cascade indicators by sex and age, both of which are collected on the diagnostic <lb/>and VL test requisition forms and missing for less than 1% of the cohort. We did not explore <lb/>indicators by race/ethnicity or HIV exposure category as this information was missing for <lb/>approximately half of participants or more. This missing information was due to a combina-<lb/>tion of factors, including providers not filling out diagnostic requisition forms and race/eth-<lb/>nicity not being collected on the LEP prior to 2009. In addition, race/ethnicity and HIV <lb/>exposure category are not collected on VL test requisition forms and are therefore missing for <lb/>participants with no linked HIV diagnostic test (approximately 25% of participants). <lb/>All analyses were descriptive and no formal statistical testing across time or populations <lb/>was conducted. We considered this reasonable as our data is population-based (not a random <lb/>sample) [47] and the large sample size would mean even small differences are statistically sig-<lb/>nificant [48]. <lb/>Ethical approval <lb/>This applied research study was approved by the Ethics Review Board at Public Health <lb/>Ontario. <lb/>Results <lb/>Cohort creation and follow-up <lb/>As of 2015, there were a cumulative total of 40,372 confirmed HIV-positive diagnostic test rec-<lb/>ords (1985-2015) and 23,851 unique individuals with a record of �1 VL test (1996-2015) in <lb/>the HIV datamart (Fig 1). Of the HIV-positive diagnostic tests, 18,683 (46.3%) were conducted <lb/>non-nominally and excluded from the cohort. Of note, the percent of diagnostic tests that <lb/>were non-nominal decreased from 48.9% in 2000 to 15.0% in 2015 (S1 Table). <lb/>Overall, 29,587 unique individuals with a nominal HIV-positive diagnostic test and/or �1 <lb/>VL test were included in the cohort. As of the end of 2015, these individuals had been followed <lb/></body>

Between 2000 and 2015, <lb/>the number of diagnosed PLWH (cohort individuals not LTFU) increased from 8,859 (upper <lb/>bound: 11,389) to 16,110 (upper bound: 17,423) (Fig 2A). <lb/>Cohort sociodemographic profile <lb/>In 2015, the majority of the 16,110 diagnosed PLWH in the cohort were male (79.6%) or 45 <lb/>years of age or older (62.6%) (Table 2). The percent of diagnosed PLWH who were 45 years of <lb/>age or older doubled from 29.1% in 2000 to 62.6% in 2015, while the percent who were female <lb/>increased from 15.0% in 2000 to 20.0% in 2008 and has since remained relatively stable (Tables <lb/>A and B in S2 Table). <lb/>Date of diagnosis, race/ethnicity and HIV exposure category were missing for a large pro-<lb/>portion of participants (Table 2). Where this information was known, the majority of individu-<lb/>als in 2015 were diagnosed between 2006 and 2015 (54.9%), the most common race/ethnicity <lb/>was White (51.4%) followed by Black (26.9%), and the most common HIV exposure category <lb/>was men who have sex with men (46.4%) followed by heterosexual (18.5%). <lb/>Cascade indicators <lb/>Indicator estimates for the most recent years of analysis (2014/2015) are summarized in <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Differences by age were more noticeable, with indicator estimates generally consistently <lb/>higher for older age groups. In 2015, the percent of diagnosed PLWH who were virally sup-<lb/>pressed was 64.2%, 67.9%, 76.4%, 82.2%, and 85.9% among those aged &lt;25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-<lb/>54, and 55+, respectively (Fig 5C).

Our study is one of few published efforts to have measured <lb/>the cascade using a population-based data source with individual-level linkage from diagnosis <lb/>to suppression [15], and to our knowledge only the second of these to use a cohort-based <lb/>approach [15,18], despite such data sources/approaches being recommended as optimal for <lb/>cascade measurement [10,15]. In our study, the &quot;linked to care&quot; and &quot;in care&quot; indicators were <lb/>both relatively high across the 16-year study period and increased only slightly, while there <lb/>were more dramatic increases in the &quot;on ART&quot;, &quot;virally suppressed&quot;, and time from diagnosis-<lb/>to-suppression indicators. These trends are similar to those observed in other population-<lb/>based HIV cascade studies [16,18]. Improvements in cascade indicators over time are likely <lb/>Fig 4.

			<body>due to a combination of factors, such as better access to care and ART, availability of ART regi-<lb/>mens that are more effective and easier to take, changes to ART guidelines recommending ear-<lb/>lier initiation of treatment and opposing treatment interruptions, the success of care and <lb/>treatment initiatives, and/or changes in the diagnosed population over time. <lb/>Our results fill an important gap in HIV cascade knowledge in Ontario and complement <lb/>other related studies. The Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study (OCS) follows over <lb/>4000 PLWH actively receiving medical care from specialty HIV clinics across the province and <lb/>includes approximately a quarter of all PLWH receiving care in Ontario [49,50]. Our results <lb/>are similar to those observed in the OCS: a relatively stable percent in care, increases in ART <lb/>use beginning in the mid-2000s and a relatively constant increase in the percent who are virally <lb/>suppressed [37]. Another study team in Ontario has developed an administrative cohort of <lb/>PLWH using population-based data on physician billing claims housed at the Institute of Clin-<lb/>ical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Between 2009-2012, the majority of individuals in this cohort <lb/>accessed HIV-related care through family physicians (55%) followed by HIV specialists (36%), <lb/>while the remainder received little-to-no usual care (9%) [38]. Our estimate of about 15% of <lb/>diagnosed PLWH who were not in care is higher than the 9% reported through the ICES <lb/>cohort, which is expected as our cohort includes those who never enter care after diagnosis. <lb/>Fig 5.

			<body>Despite high and improving cascade estimates, we still identified gaps where improvement <lb/>is needed. In 2015, 13% of diagnosed PLWH were not in care, 7% were in care but not on ART <lb/>and 6% were on ART but not virally suppressed. These gaps were larger if the lower bounds <lb/>for these indicators were considered. In addition, 18% were not linked to care within three <lb/>months of diagnosis and 59% did not achieve viral suppression within six months. <lb/>Cascade indicators were also generally lower for younger individuals, as observed in a clini-<lb/>cal HIV cohort in Ontario (the OCS) [37,51] and other jurisdictions [16,30,52]. While our <lb/>analyses did not adjust for time since diagnosis (many older individuals may have had more <lb/>time to progress through the cascade stages), others in Ontario have reported that the associa-<lb/>tion between older age and higher indicator estimates remains after adjustment for this poten-<lb/>tial confounder [37]. Further, we observed more timely viral suppression among individuals <lb/>who were newly diagnosed with HIV at older ages, an analysis which inherently adjusts for <lb/>time since diagnosis. Possible barriers to HIV care and treatment among youth include <lb/>stigma, housing instability, transportation, mental health and substance use issues, difficulty <lb/>accessing appropriate support services, and challenges in transitioning from pediatric to adult <lb/>care [53-55]. <lb/>In contrast to studies from the United States [16,30], but similar to an analysis from the <lb/>Canadian province of BC [52], our indicator estimates among diagnosed PLWH were consis-<lb/>tently slightly lower for females. Importantly, however, we did not explore cascade estimates <lb/>by sub-populations of males and females, and other studies have demonstrated lower engage-<lb/>ment in care among heterosexual males compared to men who have sex with men <lb/>[16,37,51,52]. Interestingly, we did not observe a consistent difference by sex in our longitudi-<lb/>nal indicators among newly diagnosed cases. This may be due to dissimilarities between preva-<lb/>lent and newly diagnosed cases, or due to bias introduced by excluding individuals with a VL <lb/>test only from the newly diagnosed sample. The latter may be true as many of these excluded <lb/>individuals were likely non-nominally diagnosed individuals, and non-nominal diagnoses in <lb/>Ontario are more likely to be MSM (Table A in S3 Table) who, as already mentioned, are a <lb/>population that tends to experience better engagement in the cascade. <lb/>Comparisons to estimates from other population-based cascades are challenged by the het-<lb/>erogeneity and limitations of data sources available across jurisdictions, as well as the varied <lb/>approaches used to censor for out-migration and death. Cascade indicators calculated with <lb/>greater uniformity/certainty may be more useful for comparing between studies, such as the <lb/>percent of VL tests in a given year that are virally suppressed. Our 2010 estimate for the per-<lb/>cent of VL tests that were suppressed (79%) was higher than the US 19-jurisdiction study (69% <lb/>in 2010) [21] and New York City (~72% in 2010) [16] but similar to King County (79% in <lb/>2011) [17] and Denmark (80% in 2010) [19]. However, even these comparisons may be limited <lb/>by the different VL thresholds used to define viral suppression. Regardless, a potentially more <lb/>valid and informative use of cascade data is to focus on intra-jurisdiction comparisons, such as <lb/>analyses by time, age, sex and other sociodemographic characteristics. Future analyses of our <lb/>cohort will attempt to stratify cascade measures by region and Ontario&apos;s priority populations <lb/>(e.g. gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, including trans men; African, Carib-<lb/>bean and Black communities; Indigenous persons; people who use drugs; at-risk women, <lb/>including trans women), where possible, in order to identify further opportunities for cascade <lb/>improvement. <lb/>Perhaps the most relevant comparison is to the cascade in BC (given the similar cohort-<lb/>based methodology and Canadian setting), but this is particularly challenged by the different <lb/>measurement approaches. The more stringent approach used in BC means that the province is <lb/>often referenced as having lower cascade estimates compared to others [15], a result that <lb/>would seem at odds with the province&apos;s universal access to ART and progressive HIV policies <lb/></body>

			<body>and programming. In sensitivity analyses-where authors of the BC study adopt indicator def-<lb/>initions more similar to ours and others-the percent of diagnosed PLWH who were sup-<lb/>pressed in 2010 increased from 49% to 70% [18], putting it on the higher end of cascade <lb/>estimates compared to other jurisdictions. These sensitivity analyses further highlight the chal-<lb/>lenge in comparing between studies and the importance of a standardized approach. <lb/>We altered our main indicator definitions in order to calculate upper/lower bounds and <lb/>found estimates to be particularly sensitive to the more conservative definitions. Alternative <lb/>definitions/assumptions were based on the range of definitions used in the literature and the <lb/>nature of our data source. Use of our more conservative &quot;on ART&quot; and &quot;virally suppressed&quot; <lb/>definitions in the numerator (in which individuals must be on ART or suppressed on all VL <lb/>tests in a year vs. the most recent test) lowered estimates among diagnosed PLWH by 5-9% <lb/>and 6-8% absolute percentage points, respectively. In addition, use of our alternative &quot;Upper&quot; <lb/>diagnosed PLWH definition in the denominator (in which non-nominal HIV-positive diagno-<lb/>ses were included and the LTFU criteria extended to 3 years) decreased these estimates by a <lb/>further 6-12% and 6-9%, respectively. While these differences are not insignificant, an alterna-<lb/>tive approach to measuring the number of diagnosed PLWH in New York City led to a 23% <lb/>absolute change in the percent virally suppressed [56]. The use of these alternative definitions/ <lb/>assumptions demonstrates how indicator estimates can be impacted by both definitions and <lb/>methodological assumptions, and the importance of presenting a range of plausible estimates <lb/>instead of what is likely an artificially precise single estimate [14]. <lb/>Measuring progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target is a priority for cascade analyses. <lb/>According to our 2015 estimates, roughly 81% of diagnosed PLWH were on ART (2 nd <lb/>UNAIDS 90 target) and 94% of PLWH on ART were virally suppressed (3 rd UNAIDS 90 tar-<lb/>get). Assuming the national Canadian estimate for the 1 st UNAIDS 90 target (80%) [57] applies <lb/>to Ontario, then approximately 61% of all PLWH in the province would have been virally sup-<lb/>pressed in 2015, which is short of the UNAIDS target of 73% when all 90-90-90 targets are <lb/>simultaneously met. Modeling efforts are underway to estimate the total number of PLWH in <lb/>Ontario in order to better measure progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target. <lb/>The main strengths of our study were the adoption of methodological recommendations <lb/>from several reviews and studies. These recommendations include the use of population-based <lb/>data sources to maximize representativeness of our jurisdiction [10,15], individual-level link-<lb/>age from diagnosis to suppression to ensure &quot;denominator-denominator&quot; and &quot;numerator-<lb/>denominator&quot; linkage and to maximize the internal consistency of our outcomes [10], use of a <lb/>cohort-based approach to facilitate analysis of trends over time and measures of delay (i.e. <lb/>time to care and suppression) [10,11], use of standardized cascade elements and definitions to <lb/>improve comparability to other jurisdictions [15], and use of alternative definitions/assump-<lb/>tions to create a range of plausible bounds around main estimates [14]. <lb/>Our study had limitations related to the analyses. ART status was based on the recording of <lb/>this information on VL test requisition forms-data that was missing on 17-20% of requisi-<lb/>tions. However, we made conservative assumptions on ART status for requisitions with miss-<lb/>ing data. Further, we relied solely on VL tests as a proxy for care visits and not VL and CD4 <lb/>tests as done in most studies (CD4 laboratory testing is not centralized in Ontario) [15]. In one <lb/>cascade analysis, the percent of diagnosed PLWH who were in care was 4% absolute percent-<lb/>age points higher when both CD4 and/or VL tests were used as opposed to VL tests alone [21]. <lb/>Information on HIV exposure category and race/ethnicity were missing for a large proportion <lb/>of cohort participants, making it difficult to stratify indicators by these characteristics. Of note, <lb/>our study team is currently evaluating multiple imputation approaches to address missing <lb/>sociodemographic and ART data. Although our data were linked at the individual-level and <lb/>longitudinal in nature, our analyses were mostly cross-sectional by year and based on a linear <lb/></body>

			<body>conceptualization of the HIV cascade (as this is the traditional approach to measuring the cas-<lb/>cade). Cross-sectional approaches fail to account for changes in a population over time and do <lb/>not reflect the dynamic nature of HIV care [10,14]. Unlike many other cascade studies, we did <lb/>not estimate engagement in &quot;continuous care&quot;, a cross-sectional measure typically defined as <lb/>two care visits �3 months apart in a given year [16,17,21,51]. We were concerned about the <lb/>potential impact of changing VL testing practices on the validity of this measure. For example, <lb/>clinicians may recommend less frequent visits/measurement of VL for individuals who are <lb/>healthy and durably suppressed, with the risk that such individuals could be misclassified as <lb/>not engaged in continuous care if assessed by frequency of VL testing. A recent clinical cohort <lb/>study found that 10% of participants not defined as being engaged in continuous care were <lb/>virally suppressed, yet these individuals would be excluded from the numerator of subsequent <lb/>cascade steps [58]. Future analyses of our cascade will explore longitudinal approaches <lb/>informed by non-linear cascade frameworks and measure transitions in and out of different <lb/>stages [59-62]. Finally, all our analyses were descriptive and future research will explore <lb/>regression analyses to identify predictors of cascade engagement (pending strategies to address <lb/>missing data). <lb/>There were also limitations related to the nature of our cohort. While we believe our cohort <lb/>captures the vast majority of diagnosed PLWH in the province, a small number of individuals <lb/>may have been missed due to the exclusion of non-nominal diagnoses and our indirect censor-<lb/>ship for out-migration and death. However, we assume that the majority of non-nominally <lb/>diagnosed individuals will present for HIV care and be included in the cohort as an individual <lb/>with a VL test only (no linked diagnostic test). Of note, those diagnosed non-nominally who <lb/>never connect to care are not included in our cohort, while non-nominally diagnosed individ-<lb/>uals are less likely to be included in the newly diagnosed sample (as this sample excludes indi-<lb/>viduals with a VL test only). Further, as a result of indirectly censoring for death and out-<lb/>migration (&gt;2 years with no VL test and no VL test in later years), it is likely that some diag-<lb/>nosed individuals were inappropriately removed from our cohort. Indirect censorship is com-<lb/>mon in other studies of diagnosed PLWH but there is no standardized approach (LTFU rules <lb/>range from 1.5 to 7 years with no healthcare use) [16,18,35]. Finally, our retrospective LTFU <lb/>rule may have biased estimates in more current years, as those recently LTFU may not have <lb/>had time to return to care and be retrospectively included as diagnosed PLWH. Linkage of our <lb/>cohort to other administrative health care databases is planned in order to strengthen our data <lb/>source. <lb/>In conclusion, our population-based assessment of HIV cascade indicators in Ontario dem-<lb/>onstrates substantial improvement from 2000 to 2015. Our results also indicate room for fur-<lb/>ther improvement, particularly among younger individuals. The results in this paper are the <lb/>first to emerge from our newly created data source, the Ontario HIV Laboratory Cohort, and <lb/>fill an important gap in our understanding of Ontario&apos;s cascade. Notable limitations inherent <lb/>to our data source include the exclusion of non-nominal diagnoses; missing ART, CD4 and <lb/>sociodemographic information; and indirect censorship for out-migration and death. Future <lb/>efforts will build upon these analyses by exploring non-linear cascade frameworks, stratifying <lb/>estimates by region and priority population, and strengthening our data source via linkage to <lb/>additional administrative health care databases. <lb/></body>
