			In the field of molecular evolution, we commonly calculate site-<lb/>specific evolutionary rates from alignments of amino-acid se-<lb/>quences. For example, catalytic residues in enzymes and interface <lb/>regions in protein complexes can be inferred from observed relative <lb/>rates. While numerous approaches exist to calculate amino-acid <lb/>rates, it is not entirely clear what physical quantities the inferred <lb/>rates represent and how these rates relate to the underlying fitness <lb/>landscape of the evolving proteins. Further, amino-acid rates can <lb/>be calculated in the context of different amino-acid exchangeabil-<lb/>ity matrices, such as JTT, LG, or WAG, and again it is not well un-<lb/>derstood how the choice of the matrix influences the physical inter-<lb/>pretation of the inferred rates. Here, we develop a theory of mea-<lb/>surement for site-specific evolutionary rates, by analytically solving <lb/>the maximum-likelihood equations for rate inference performed on <lb/>sequences evolved under a mutation-selection model. We demon-<lb/>strate that for realistic analysis settings the measurement process <lb/>will recover the true expected rates of the mutation-selection model <lb/>if rates are measured relative to a naïve exchangeability matrix, in <lb/>which all exchangeabilities are equal to 1/19. We also show that rate <lb/>measurements using other matrices are quantitatively close but in <lb/>general not mathematically equivalent. Our results demonstrate that <lb/>insights obtained from phylogenetic-tree inference do not necessar-<lb/>ily apply to rate inference, and best practices for the former may be <lb/>deleterious for the latter. <lb/>Protein evolution | Theory of measurement | Rate heterogeneity <lb/></front>

			<body>A quantity of broad interest in molecular evolution is the <lb/>site-specific rate of evolution, defined as the rate at which <lb/>a given nucleotide, amino-acid, or codon position evolves in <lb/>a gene or genome (1). Site specific evolutionary rates can be <lb/>used, for example, to identify sites of structural or functional <lb/>importance in proteins, as those sites tend to evolve at the <lb/>lowest rates (2-10). Several methods have been proposed to <lb/>measure site-wise rate of evolution in protein sequences (11-18). <lb/>These methods all measure rates as scaling factors in front of a <lb/>fixed exchangeability matrix describing the relative likelihood <lb/>that certain amino acids are substituted by other ones. The <lb/>exchangeability matrix is usually not estimated from the data, <lb/>because it contains many more parameters than can be reliably <lb/>estimated from moderately sized alignments. Significant effort <lb/>has been expended into empirically deriving exchangeability <lb/>matrices from large sequence databases (19-27). However, <lb/>recent analysis has shown, somewhat surprisingly, that rate <lb/>estimates are largely insensitive to the choice of exchangeability <lb/>matrix used in the inference process (16). And yet, a simplistic <lb/>equal-rates exchangeability matrix could uniquely identify <lb/>rapidly-evolving sites that models with empirically-derived <lb/>exchangeabilities could not (16). These observations highlight <lb/>that the optimal choice of the exchangeability matrix is both <lb/>non-obvious and consequential in practical applications. <lb/>The rate parameters of interest are generally estimated <lb/>via maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods, and they are <lb/>expressed as scalar variables inside the model likelihood func-<lb/>tion. While the estimation process for such scalar parameters <lb/>is well understood from a statistical modeling perspective, <lb/>the statistical perspective does not provide insight into the <lb/>physical meaning of the estimated rate parameters. What ac-<lb/>tual physical quantities do the parameter estimates represent? <lb/>To make progress on this question, it helps to think of the <lb/>model fitting process as a measurement process. By fitting <lb/>a likelihood model to an alignment of sequence data, we are <lb/>choosing numbers (the parameter estimates) that are in some <lb/>quantifiable way linked to the reality that created the data. <lb/>Importantly, how changes in the real world are reflected in <lb/>the estimated parameters is not obvious from inspecting the <lb/>likelihood function. It requires a careful calculation of the ex-<lb/>pected parameter estimates given specific underlying realities. <lb/>The link between a parameter estimate and the real world <lb/>is called a theory of measurement (28), and we develop here <lb/>such a theory for site-specific evolutionary rates in amino-acid <lb/>sequences. <lb/>Our overall approach is to assume we know the process that <lb/>generates the data (i.e., describes the real world), and then we <lb/>use maximum likelihood to calculate evolutionary rates under <lb/>different estimation procedures. We show that this procedure <lb/>can be performed analytically for a broad class of generating <lb/>models and it produces meaningful closed-form solutions. Our <lb/>analysis reveals that by measuring rates with a naïve, equal-<lb/>rates exchangeability matrix we can recover the true expected <lb/>rates of the generating process. Thus, in a precise, quantifiable <lb/>sense, we can state that the naïve exchangeability matrix is <lb/>Significance Statement <lb/>Maximum likelihood inference is widely used to infer model pa-<lb/>rameters from sequence data in an evolutionary context. One <lb/>major challenge in such inference procedures is the problem <lb/>of having to identify the appropriate model used for inference. <lb/>Model parameters usually are meaningful only to the extent that <lb/>the model is appropriately specified and matches the process <lb/>that generated the data. However, in practice, we don&apos;t know <lb/>what process generated the data, and most models in actual <lb/>use are misspecified. To circumvent this problem, we show <lb/>here that we can employ maximum likelihood inference to make <lb/>defined and meaningful measurements on arbitrary processes. <lb/>Our approach uses misspecification as a deliberate strategy, <lb/>and this strategy results in robust and meaningful parameter <lb/>inference. <lb/></body>

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>the ideal matrix for performing meaningful measurements of <lb/>evolutionary rates. Our analysis also explains why commonly <lb/>used exchangeability matrices yield rate inferences that are <lb/>similar to each other and to the naïve substitution matrix. <lb/>Results <lb/>The evolution of a genetic sequence can be thought of as a <lb/>single ancestor sequence changing over time and diverging into <lb/>multiple descendant sequences. Different sites evolve at differ-<lb/>ent rates (1), which will cause the descendant sequences to vary <lb/>at some sites from each other and from the ancestor sequence <lb/>(Figure 1A). The evolutionary divergence of sequences over <lb/>time is commonly modeled with a continuous-time Markov <lb/>model (29), and most models currently in practical use assume <lb/>that each site evolves independently and thus can be described <lb/>by its own Markov chain (but see (30, 31)). A mutation may <lb/>occur at any site, and it subsequently either fixes or is lost to <lb/>drift. The Markov model simplifies the substitution process <lb/>by capturing only the mutations that fix (32-35), and the <lb/>states of the Markov chain correspond to the set of possible <lb/>mutations that can arise and fix. <lb/>Here, we specifically study the evolution of protein se-<lb/>quences, and therefore the state space of a Markov chain <lb/>describing the evolutionary process of an individual site con-<lb/>sists of the 20 amino acids. We write the probability of being <lb/>in the state corresponding to amino acid i as πi. State changes <lb/>from amino acid i to j occur according to the generator matrix <lb/>Q = qij, which describes the transition probabilities dur-<lb/>ing an infinitesimally small time interval. For finite times t, <lb/>transition probabilities can be written as P (t) = e tQ , where <lb/>P (t) <lb/>ij = pij(t) is the probability that amino acid i is sub-<lb/>stituted by amino acid j during a time interval t. <lb/>In a conventional data analysis scenario, we will know the <lb/>sequences from which we want to infer rates but we don&apos;t <lb/>know the process that guided the evolution of these sequence. <lb/>Here, to obtain insight into the inference process, we assume <lb/>that we know the sequence-generating process, and that it can <lb/>be described by a Markov process as described in the previous <lb/>paragraph. We will call this model the &quot;true model&quot;, and <lb/>we denote it with a subscript T, as follows: P <lb/>(k) <lb/>T (t) = e tQ (k) <lb/>T . <lb/>Here, the superscript k indicates the site in the sequence <lb/>described by this model. We assume we have multiple sites, <lb/>all with their own generating matrix Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T . However, t is not <lb/>site dependent. It is shared by all sites. We emphasize that in <lb/>an actual inference scenario, neither t nor Q T nor P T (t) would <lb/>be known. <lb/>To measure site-wise rates of evolution from the sequences <lb/>generated by the true model, we fit a different Markov model to <lb/>the sequences. We call this model the &quot;measurement model&quot;, <lb/>and we denote it with a subscript M, as follows: P M ( t, r(k) ) = <lb/>e tr (k) Q M . The measurement model is similar but not identical <lb/>to the true model. First, because we don&apos;t know the elements <lb/>of the true model matrix Q T , we cannot guarantee that the <lb/>measurement matrix Q M is identical to the true matrix at <lb/>any site. In fact, for most of this paper, we assume the same <lb/>matrix Q M is used at all sites. Second, instead of a single <lb/>scalar parameter t describing divergence time/branch length, <lb/>we have two, t and r(k) . t is the estimated branch length, <lb/>shared among all sites, and r(k) is the estimated evolutionary <lb/>rate at site k. Because the three quantities t, r(k) , and Q M <lb/>enter the term P M ( t, r(k) ) via a product, the choice of Q M will <lb/>generally affect the inferred branch length t and site-specific <lb/>rate of evolution r(k) . We also note that t and r(k) always <lb/>appear as the product tr (k) , and hence they are only uniquely <lb/>specified up to a multiplicative constant. We resolve this <lb/>ambiguity by enforcing the mean of r(k) over all sites k to be <lb/>one. <lb/>Because our inference model a priori makes no specific <lb/>assumptions about the elements of the measurement matrix <lb/>Q M , we have a wide range of different choices. We can arrange <lb/>these choices along a line from most realistic to least realistic <lb/>when compared to the true matrix. At one end of this line <lb/>lies the true matrix Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T (Figure 1B). At the other end lies <lb/>the completely uninformative, naïve matrix, which has no <lb/>knowledge about the substitution rates between amino acids. <lb/>It assumes that all rates of substitution are equal to each <lb/>other. Thus, it can be thought of as a Jukes-Cantor-like <lb/>matrix (36) for amino acids, and we refer to it as Q JC (Figure <lb/>1B). Commonly used substitution matrices, such as JTT (19), <lb/>WAG (20), and LG (21) fall somewhere in between these two <lb/>extremes. They will be more realistic (and hence closer to the <lb/>true matrix) than Q JC , but they certainly are not equal to <lb/>Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T , in particular since the true substitution process has to be <lb/>assumed to be different at each site. Because any matrix Q M <lb/>we may use falls somewhere on this line from completely true <lb/>to entirely uninformative, we can systematically explore how <lb/>the choice of measurement matrix influences the estimates <lb/>of site-wise rates. In particular, we can analytically solve <lb/>the inference equations at the two extreme ends, and we can <lb/>also solve the inference equations in the limit of t → 0. In <lb/>combination with numerics for cases where an analytic solution <lb/>is not available, this analysis provides for a comprehensive <lb/>characterization of the choice of measurement matrix on the <lb/>inference process. <lb/>Rate measured with an arbitrary measurement matrix for <lb/>t <lb/>1. We assume that the measurement model is fit to the <lb/>sequence data by maximum likelihood (ML). As is customary, <lb/>we assume that the measurement model and the true model are <lb/>time-reversible (29). For analytic tractability, we consider the <lb/>simplest possible case of two sequences that have diverged for <lb/>some time t. Because site-wise parameters cannot be reliably <lb/>inferred from an alignment consisting of only two sequences, <lb/>we employ a mathematical trick and assume each site in the <lb/>alignment is duplicated n times. As part of our derivation, <lb/>we can show that the choice of n is irrelevant, and our re-<lb/>sults remain valid (on average) in the limit of n → 1. The <lb/>detailed mathematical formulation of our theory and detailed <lb/>derivations are provided in the SI Appendix. <lb/>First, we analytically derive site-wise rates measured with <lb/>an unspecified measurement matrix Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M in the limit of t → 0. <lb/>In this limit, we can assume that the estimated time t is <lb/>proportional to the true time t, t = Ct for some constant <lb/>C. Without loss of generality, we set C = 1. (We implicitly <lb/>obtain the correct C when we normalize the rates r(k) .) In <lb/>this scenario, we find (SI Appendix) <lb/>r(k) = <lb/>i,j =i π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ij <lb/>i,j =i π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M,ij <lb/>r <lb/>[1] <lb/></body>

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>Fig. 1. Inference context and framework. (A) We study the process of site-specific rate inference at the amino-acid level in a phylogenetic context. As a protein sequence <lb/>evolves, substitutions (shown by colored dots and letters) along specific branches introduce site-specific variation. Some sites (e.g., here, site 3) change much faster than <lb/>others (e.g., sites 1, 4, or 5). The goal of rate inference is to obtain a numeric value that accurately represents the rate at which a site changes. (B) Substitution matrices <lb/>used for rate inference can have different degrees of realism, indicated along a line from left to right. All the way to the left, we assume there is a true substitution matrix that <lb/>describes the exact physical process governing the evolution of site k. This matrix exists only hypothetically and it can never be known for a natural system. All the way to the <lb/>right, we have the completely uninformative Jukes-Cantor-like matrix Q JC , which assumes that all substitution rates are the same for all possible amino-acid substitutions. In <lb/>between these two extremes reside actual matrices used for rate inference, such as JTT, WAG, or LG. <lb/>Fig. 2. Comparison of the inferred rates and the analytically derived rates, in a model of two sequences diverged for time t and with n = 100, 000 site duplicates. Rates are <lb/>inferred with the Jukes-Cantor-like matrix and normalized to their mean across sites. The black line represents the analytically derived rate for arbitrary time t (equation 3). The <lb/>blue line represents the analytically derived rate when time t is small (equation 4). The green line represent the analytically derived rate when time t is large (equation 5). The <lb/>red dots represent the mean inferred rate at each time point across 30 simulations. The error bars represent the standard error. For all points, the bars are smaller than the <lb/>symbol size. The horizontal line at 1 represents the average rate in the sequence. (A-D) Rate over time for sites 1, 2, 4, and 5, respectively, in egg white lysozyme (PDB ID: <lb/>132L)(37). Convergence to the predicted mean rate with increasing number of site duplicates n is shown in Fig. S1. <lb/>with <lb/>r = <lb/>1 <lb/>m <lb/>k <lb/>r(k) . <lb/>[2] <lb/>Here, m is the total number of sites in the sequence, and r <lb/>is the mean rate across sites, which we use for normalization. <lb/>By π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i <lb/>we denote the stationary probabilities of the true <lb/>model at site k. Note that <lb/>i,j =i π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ij is the steady-<lb/>state rate of substitutions under the true model at site k, <lb/>and <lb/>i,j =i π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M,ij is the rate with which the process would <lb/>leave the true-model steady state if the transition matrix were <lb/>switched to the measurement matrix. Thus, the inferred rate <lb/>r(k) is the ratio of the true steady-state substitution rate to <lb/>the substitution rate under the measurement matrix, starting <lb/>from the true equilibrium state. <lb/>Eq. (1) provides several key insights. First, if the measure-<lb/>ment matrix equals the true matrix, then the relative rate <lb/>r(k) = 1. Second, for any measurement matrix for which all <lb/>the column sums are equal, <lb/>i,n =i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M,in = j,n =j q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M,jn ∀i, j, <lb/>the denominator drops out of the equation and the estimated <lb/>rate equals the steady-state rate under the true model. Third, <lb/>when the column sums of the measurement matrix are not <lb/>equal, the meaning of the inferred r(k) is unclear. <lb/>Rates measured at arbitrary t, using the naïve substitution <lb/>matrix. The two extremes described in Figure 1B, where the <lb/>measurement matrix is either the true matrix or the naïve <lb/>matrix, can be further analyzed for any divergence time t. If <lb/>the measurement matrix is the same as the site&apos;s true substitu-<lb/>tion matrix, then the true model and the fitted model become <lb/>the same. In this case, the inference model recovers true time <lb/>( t = t) and the estimated rate becomes 1 (r (k) = 1). So, for <lb/>any site, if inference is performed using the true substitution <lb/>matrix, then inference of a relative rate is meaningless, since <lb/>that rate will always be measured as 1. <lb/>Next we consider the case where the site-wise rate is mea-<lb/>sured using the naïve substitution matrix, which we also refer <lb/>to as the Jukes-Cantor-like matrix (JC). In this matrix, the <lb/>substitution rate from any amino acid to any other amino <lb/>acid is 1/19. After solving the ML equations, we find (SI <lb/>Appendix) <lb/>r(k) (t) = log 1 − <lb/>20 <lb/>19 <lb/>i,j =i <lb/>π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i p <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ij (t) <lb/>r(t) . <lb/>[3] <lb/>We note that this equation depends on t; the estimated rate <lb/>is not constant. In the limit of t → 0, the estimated rate <lb/>becomes <lb/>r(k) (0) = <lb/>i,j =i <lb/>π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ij <lb/>r(0) , <lb/>[4] <lb/>consistent with Eq. (1). <lb/>For completeness, we also report the limit of Eq. (3) for <lb/>t → ∞, which is <lb/>r(k) (∞) = log 1 − <lb/>20 <lb/>19 <lb/>i,j =i <lb/>π <lb/>(k) <lb/>i π <lb/>(k) <lb/>j <lb/>r(∞) . <lb/>[5] <lb/>To test our theory numerically, we simulate sequences under <lb/>a given true model and then infer rates via the standard <lb/></body>

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>maximum likelihood approach. To generate realistic simulated <lb/>sequences, we use a mutation-selection (MutSel) model (38, <lb/>39) which we parameterize from predicted stability effects of <lb/>mutations in a protein structure (37). We find that when we <lb/>use Q JC in the maximum likelihood inference, as assumed in <lb/>the derivation of equations 3-5, the predicted rate estimates <lb/>agree perfectly with the average inferred rate estimates, at all <lb/>times t (Figure 2). <lb/>Measurement using a matrix that is proportional to the true <lb/>matrix. As equation 3 shows, in the general case of measure-<lb/>ment using the JC-like matrix the estimated rates change with <lb/>divergence time t. Only in the limit of small t (equation 4) do <lb/>we recover the result that the estimated rate corresponds to <lb/>the mean substitution rate in the true model. To investigate <lb/>the cause of this time dependency, we derive the estimated <lb/>rate under the assumption that the measurement matrix is <lb/>proportional to the true matrix. Specifically, we assume that <lb/>the true matrix Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T = r (k) Q, where Q is any arbitrary sub-<lb/>stitution matrix, and we then set Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M = Q. In this case, <lb/>we can show that the fitted model recovers true time ( t = t) <lb/>and the true rate parameter modulating Q (r (k) = r (k) ) (SI <lb/>Appendix). <lb/>To numerically validate this calculation, we simulate evo-<lb/>lution using a true model with Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T = r (k) Q JC and the r (k) <lb/>at each site drawn from a gamma distribution (see Methods). <lb/>After performing rate inference with Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>M = Q JC , we recover <lb/>the original r (k) , and the estimates do not depend on t as <lb/>predicted (Figure S2). <lb/>These results suggest that the time dependence of the in-<lb/>ferred rate seen in equation 3 and Fig. 2 is caused by the <lb/>mismatch between the true model and the JC inference model. <lb/>Even though the rate should be a separate parameter indepen-<lb/>dent of t, when we use a JC inference model the inferred rate <lb/>depends somewhat on divergence time. However, this artifact <lb/>disappears when the measurement matrix is proportional to <lb/>the true matrix, in which case ML can recover the true model <lb/>parameters. Of course, in any real-world application it is never <lb/>possible to have the measurement matrix be exactly propor-<lb/>tional to the true model matrix, and hence moderate time <lb/>dependence of the inferred rate parameter has to be expected <lb/>in all realistic rate-inference applications. <lb/>Rate measured with commonly used matrices. We have been <lb/>able to analytically solve the maximum likelihood equations for <lb/>the JC-like matrix, but in practice that matrix is rarely used <lb/>for rate inference. Instead, commonly used matrices include <lb/>matrices such as JTT, WAG, and LG, as shown in Figure <lb/>1. Moreover, we have solved the ML equations for a pair of <lb/>diverged sequences and with site duplicates, but in a realistic <lb/>application we would perform inference on individual sites in <lb/>a multiple sequence alignment and corresponding phylogenetic <lb/>tree. To assess the extent to which matrix choice affects rate <lb/>inference, we use the JTT, WAG, and LG matrices in addition <lb/>to the JC-like matrix for inference on simulated multiple <lb/>sequence alignments without site duplicates. For reference, we <lb/>compare the inferred rates to the predicted rates at small t <lb/>(equation 4), which we hypothesize to generalize to inference <lb/>on multiple sequences. We find that the rates inferred with <lb/>JTT, WAG, and LG behave very similar to each other and to <lb/>the JC matrix for all branch lengths (Figures 3 and S3). In <lb/>addition, and as expected from the results in the preceding <lb/>section, the inferred rates are also similar to the analytically <lb/>derived rates. In aggregate, these results are consistent with a <lb/>recent study on the impact of matrix choice on rate inference, <lb/>which has found that inferred rates are largely independent of <lb/>the chosen matrix (16). <lb/>Any general time-reversible model can be decomposed into <lb/>a symmetric matrix called the exchangeability matrix and <lb/>a vector of equilibrium frequencies (29). Strictly speaking, <lb/>the various matrices JTT, WAG, and LG are exchangeability <lb/>matrices that need to be combined with equilibrium frequencies <lb/>to specify the full model matrix. If we were to use any of these <lb/>matrices as is, we would implicitly assume uniform amino-acid <lb/>frequencies. This is not normally done, however. Instead, <lb/>the observed amino-acid frequencies in the multiple sequence <lb/>alignment are commonly used as equilibrium frequencies, and <lb/>we follow this practice here for JTT, WAG, and LG (see <lb/>Methods). By contrast, our theoretical derivation with the <lb/>JC-like matrix uses the matrix as is and thus assumes uniform <lb/>frequencies in the measurement model. To assess the impact <lb/>of this choice, we also perform inference with the JC-like <lb/>matrix and observed frequencies. We find that the choice of <lb/>assumed equilibrium frequencies in the measurement model <lb/>has virtually no effect on the inferred rates (Figure S4). <lb/>Codon rates measured with a naïve amino acid substitution <lb/>model. Gene sequences in natural organisms do not evolve <lb/>according to an amino acid matrix Q. Protein sequences are <lb/>encoded in DNA, and the DNA is the substrate that mutates <lb/>and evolves. Yet inference models are frequently formulated <lb/>as amino-acid models. To investigate the effect of this model <lb/>mismatch, we derive expected inferred rates when the true <lb/>model is a codon model and the inference model is an amino-<lb/>acid model using the JC-like matrix (SI Appendix). The <lb/>derivation follows the same logic as before, and for small t we <lb/>find <lb/>r(k) = <lb/>i,j =i a∈C i b∈C j <lb/>π (k) <lb/>a q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ab <lb/>r . <lb/>[6] <lb/>Here, π <lb/>(k) <lb/>a <lb/>is the true codon equilibrium frequency for a codon <lb/>a and q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T,ab is the true substitution rate between codons a and <lb/>b. Ci is the set of codons that encode amino acid i, and the <lb/>first sum (over i and j) runs over all possible amino-acid pairs. <lb/>As before, our analytic predictions of inferred mean rate agree <lb/>well with simulations (Figure S5). <lb/>Equation 6 demonstrates that the inferred rate reproduces <lb/>(on average) the true mean substitution rate between all non-<lb/>synonymous codons. Thus, it is meaningful to perform an <lb/>amino-acid based inference on codon-level data. However, <lb/>because this inference only considers changes between amino <lb/>acids, we cannot infer rates between synonymous codons. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The conventional inference approach in molecular evolution <lb/>consists of fitting a series of models by maximum likelihood <lb/>or Bayesian methods, identifying the best fitting model via <lb/>likelihood ratio test or some information criterion, and then <lb/>taking the inferred parameters of the best fitting model as the <lb/>best estimate for the parameter(s) of interest. However, an <lb/>increasing body of work shows that this process can go wrong <lb/>when the model is misspecified (39-42).

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>Fig. 3. Relationship between analytically derived rates and rates inferred with either the Jukes-Cantor-like (JC) matrix (top row) or the LG matrix (bottom row). Sequence <lb/>alignments were simulated for binary trees with 512 taxa and 124 sites, parameterized using data from egg white lysozyme (see Methods). No site duplicates were used in <lb/>these simulations. The inference with LG matrix assumed that each amino acid&apos;s equilibrium frequency is equal to the frequency of that amino acid in the entire alignment. The <lb/>inference with JC matrix assumed that each amino acid&apos;s equilibrium frequency is 1/20. The inferred rates plotted above are mean inferred rates over 50 simulations for each <lb/>time point and site. The analytically derived rate was calculated with equation 4. The numbers on top of the plot panels indicate the time t used for each simulation. The labels <lb/>on the right indicate the substitution matrix used for inference. Each point represents one site, and the diagonal line represents x = y. <lb/>closer to the true value in poorly fitting models (as evaluated <lb/>by an information criterion) than in the best fitting models <lb/>(39). A recent paper has proposed the term phenomenological <lb/>load to describe this effect (41). On the flip side, models with <lb/>very different information scores can also produce substantively <lb/>similar parameter estimates (16). We believe that the approach <lb/>we have described here, which relies neither on good model fit <lb/>nor on proper model specification but instead treats the model <lb/>fitting as a measurement process, can provide a solution to the <lb/>problems of model misspecification, phenomenological load, <lb/>and model selection. If we know what kind of a measurement <lb/>a model performs on a given dataset, we immediately obtain <lb/>an interpretable result, from one fit of one single model. For <lb/>example, in the case described here, measurement with the <lb/>Jukes-Cantor-like matrix returns rates that correspond to <lb/>the mean substitution rate in the true model. Of course, as <lb/>our calculations have shown, this statement is strictly true <lb/>only in the limit of low sequence divergence. However, the <lb/>systematic deviations for higher sequence divergence tend to <lb/>be moderate, in particular when compared to the measurement <lb/>noise inherent in making singe-site estimates, and hence we <lb/>believe that making rate measurements with the Jukes-Cantor-<lb/>like matrix is a principled approach that is as good as or better <lb/>than the alternatives at any sequence divergence level. <lb/>In phylgenetic inference, it remains an open question which <lb/>empirical matrix is the most appropriate, though LG tends <lb/>to produce better likelihood scores than do JTT or WAG <lb/>(21). We have seen here, however, that in the context of rate <lb/>inference, the rates inferred by LG, JTT, WAG, or JC are <lb/>nearly identical. A similar observation was recently published <lb/>in an empirical survey of different approaches to rate inference <lb/>(43). While JC is uninformative whereas LG, JTT, and WAG <lb/>are derived from natural protein sequences, we believe that all <lb/>these matrices are sufficiently similar to each other that they <lb/>are nearly identical for inference purposes. The explanation <lb/>for the matrices&apos; similarities lies in how they were derived <lb/>and what they represent. JC assumes that any amino acid is <lb/>permissible at any site, i.e., it assumes a completely flat fitness <lb/>landscape. JTT, WAG, and LG allow almost as wide of a <lb/>range of amino acids at each site (44), because they have been <lb/>derived by pooling data from many sites in many proteins, <lb/>thus averaging over the fitness differences between different <lb/>amino acids at different sites and not actually representing <lb/>any specific site in a protein (45). While one could conclude <lb/>from these observations that the choice of the inference matrix <lb/>is irrelevant (43), we believe that JC has a clear theoretical <lb/>advantage over the other matrices: Equation 4, which states <lb/>that in the limit of small divergence time t the inferred rate <lb/>converges to the mean substitution rate in the true model, is <lb/>generally not true for the other matrices, because of equation <lb/>1. The denominator of 1 cancels for the JC-like matrix but it <lb/>does not do so for the empirically derived matrices. <lb/>The model we have discussed here for measuring site-specific <lb/>rates has a separate rate parameter at each site, and thus is a <lb/>fixed-effects model. While some existing inference tools simi-<lb/>larly implement fixed-effects inference (43), others fit a rate <lb/>distribution to all sites at once, in a random-effects framework <lb/>(14, 15). A priori, our theory does not apply to random-effects <lb/>inference. However, empirically it is found, across a variety of <lb/>different modeling scenarios and frameworks, that fixed-effects <lb/>approaches and random-effects approaches yield rates esti-<lb/>mates that are highly correlated (43, 46, 47). Therefore, we <lb/>expect that our theoretical predictions will be approximately <lb/>correct for inference approaches based on random-effects frame-<lb/>works as well. <lb/>In our theory, evolutionary distances between amino acid <lb/>sequences are measured by the site-wise rate r(k) and time t. <lb/>In all derivations, these two quantities appear as the product <lb/>tr (k) . This product is invariant to a rescaling of r(k) = r (k) /C <lb/>and t = Ct, and rate, therefore, is not unique. To obtain <lb/>unique rates, we have to impose a normalization condition. <lb/>We have here normalized site-wise rates by the average rate <lb/>among all sites of the sequence, 1 <lb/>m <lb/>l <lb/>r(l) . This normalization <lb/>allows for simple interpretation of the rate as the relative <lb/>increase or decrease compared to the average rate of evolution <lb/>in the sequence. Alternatively, we could normalize rates to the <lb/>median, which may be advantageous when rate distributions <lb/>are overdispersed (43). <lb/></body>

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>We note several limitations to our findings. First, our cal-<lb/>culations assume that sites evolve independently of each other. <lb/>Yet epistatic interactions among protein sites are widespread, <lb/>in particular among sites that are in direct contact in the 3D <lb/>structure (48-51). Strictly speaking, our results do not hold <lb/>for interacting sites. However, we note that in our derivation, <lb/>interacting sites would only enter the true model, not the <lb/>measurement model. Thus, to the extent that the true evo-<lb/>lutionary dynamic (with interactions) generates a stochastic <lb/>process at individual sites that looks Markovian, our results <lb/>should carry over. Future work will have to test this hypothe-<lb/>sis more systematically. Second, in our simulations, we used <lb/>uniform mutation rates, so that the site-specific variation in <lb/>evolutionary rates was fully determined by fitness differences <lb/>among amino acids or codons. For more complex mutation <lb/>schemes, the inferred rates would be influenced by both the <lb/>mutation scheme and the fitness differences, and thus, with <lb/>the measurement process we describe here it is not possible <lb/>to disentangle mutation and selection. However, we empha-<lb/>size that similar problems arise in other inference approaches <lb/>(41) as well, and that the rate equations we have derived are <lb/>correct regardless of the chosen mutation scheme. Finally, our <lb/>entire analysis is true only on average and/or in the limit of <lb/>infinitely large samples. We have ignored what (if any) effect <lb/>the choice of the measurement matrix has on the variation in <lb/>the estimate at finite sample sizes. Numerically, it appears <lb/>that some matrix choices result in less variable estimates than <lb/>others (Figure 3). Future work will have to address whether <lb/>different measurement matrices generate different amounts of <lb/>variability in rate estimates. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>For detailed mathematical derivations, see SI Appendix. <lb/>Parameterizing a MutSel model using stability effects of mutations <lb/>in a protein. To parameterize a MutSel model for simulation, we <lb/>need to define site-specific scaled selection coefficients S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ij for all <lb/>pairs of amino acids i and j. To arrive at a somewhat realistic <lb/>parameterization, we used a recently proposed framework to link <lb/>protein stability to protein evolution (37). Under this framework, <lb/>we can write (SI Appendix) <lb/>S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ij = ∆∆G <lb/>(k) <lb/>oi − ∆∆G <lb/>(k) <lb/>oj . <lb/>[7] <lb/>Here, S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ij is the scaled difference in fitness between amino acid i <lb/>and amino acid j at site k and ∆∆G <lb/>(k) <lb/>oi is the change in stability of <lb/>the protein structure when a reference amino acid (which can be <lb/>arbitrarily chosen) is substituted with amino acid i at site k. We <lb/>used ∆∆G <lb/>(k) <lb/>oi data for egg white lysozyme (PDB ID: 132L) from <lb/>Ref. (37), and we calculated scaled selection coefficients for all sites <lb/>for which ∆∆G values were available (124 sites in total). From the <lb/>selection coefficients, we then calculated a substitution matrix Q <lb/>following standard MutSel theory (38) (see SI Appendix for details). <lb/>Generation of simulated sequence alignments. In all cases, we first <lb/>generated binary trees with chosen branch lengths and numbers of <lb/>taxa, using the R package ape (52). We then evolved sequences <lb/>along each tree using the python library pyvolve (53), and each site <lb/>was evolved according to a site-specific MutSel model. The MutSel <lb/>models were parameterized according to equation 7 as described <lb/>above, except in the case where Q <lb/>(k) <lb/>T = r (k) Q JC . In this latter case, <lb/>we did not have to choose scaled selection coefficients but instead <lb/>values of the true rate r (k) at each site. We assumed that the true <lb/>rates are gamma distributed, as is commonly observed in empirical <lb/>work, and we randomly drew true rates from a gamma distribution <lb/>with shape parameter α = 0.312 and rate parameter β = 1.027. <lb/>These are parameter values that have been estimated for HIV-1 <lb/>integrase (Table 2 in (54)). <lb/>Generating amino-acid alignments to verify rate derivations. Our sim-<lb/>ulations directly mimicked the assumptions made in the analytical <lb/>derivations. We simulated two sequences that have evolved from <lb/>a common ancestor and that have diverged over time. We took <lb/>the first ten sites from the egg white lysozyme and duplicated <lb/>each site n times. The site duplicates were simulated to all evolve <lb/>independently under identically parameterized models. <lb/>In a first set of simulations, we set n = 100, 000 and varied branch <lb/>lengths across 25 different values. Each tree in our simulations had <lb/>2 branches of equal lengths, and the length of the branches ranged <lb/>from 0.02 to 0.5 in the increments of 0.02 (this is equivalent to a <lb/>time range from 0.04 to 1 in the increments of 0.04). We simulated <lb/>30 replicates per tree, for a total of 750 alignments. <lb/>In a second set of simulations, we set branch length along the <lb/>two branches to 0.24 each (t = 0.48) and varied n from 10 to 100,000 <lb/>in multiples of 10. We simulated 50 replicates per number of site <lb/>duplicates, for a total of 250 alignments. <lb/>Generating codon alignments to verify rate derivations. For the case <lb/>when the true model is a codon model, we simulated two codon <lb/>sequences according to a codon MutSel model. Each site was <lb/>simulated according to a codon substitution matrix, which was <lb/>derived and parameterized similarly to the amino-acid case. We <lb/>introduced codon scaled selection coefficients S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ab analogously to <lb/>equation 7. We set codon ∆∆G values equal to the ∆∆G of <lb/>the amino acid the codons translate to. The S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ab between two <lb/>synonymous codons a and b, therefore, was 0. The S <lb/>(k) <lb/>ab between <lb/>two non-synonymous codons a and b was set to equal the difference <lb/>in the ∆∆G values between the two codons. We set the mutation <lb/>rate between any two codons to 1. As in the amino-acid case, <lb/>we simulated 10 sites of egg white lysozyme with n = 100, 000 <lb/>duplicates each. The sequences were evolved along 25 different trees. <lb/>Each tree had 2 branches of equal lengths, and the length of the <lb/>branches ranged from 0.02 to 0.5 in the increments of 0.02 (this is <lb/>equivalent to a time range from 0.04 to 1 in the increments of 0.04) <lb/>with one tree per branch length value. We simulated 30 replicates <lb/>per tree, for a total of 750 alignments. <lb/>Generating alignments to compare rates inferred with JTT, WAG, LG, <lb/>and JC matrices. We generated 4 binary trees with four different <lb/>branch lengths (0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, and 0.05) and with 512 <lb/>taxa each. We set the number of taxa to 512 because higher <lb/>numbers of taxa reduces the variation in inferred site-wise rates (55). <lb/>We simulated amino acid sequences with 124 sites parameterized <lb/>according to the ∆∆G values for egg white lysozyme, as described <lb/>above. No site duplicates were simulated, so that each site appeared <lb/>in each sequence exactly once. We simulated 50 replicates per tree, <lb/>for a total of 200 simulated alignments. <lb/>Rate inference. Similarly to our simulation approach, our inference <lb/>approach was intended to closely follow the assumptions made in <lb/>the analytical derivations of site-wise rate. We inferred rates and <lb/>time (branch length) from simulated sequences via HyPhy (11), <lb/>using code similar to the recently published LEISR model (43). For <lb/>all simulations, before inferring site-wise rates, we inferred time <lb/>t by fitting a model with r(k) set to 1 jointly to all sites in the <lb/>alignment. Subsequently, we inferred site specific rates by fitting a <lb/>separate model at each site by maximum likelihood while fixing <lb/>t <lb/>to the previously inferred global value. <lb/>To confirm rate derivations for equations 3-5, we performed <lb/>inference using the Jukes-Cantor-like (JC) matrix (every off-diagonal <lb/>element is 1/19 and every element on the diagonal is −1) with <lb/>uniform amino-acid equilibrium frequencies (the frequency of each <lb/>amino acid is equal to 1/20). We inferred one rate per site, with the <lb/>n duplicates counting as one joint site, for a total of 10 inferences <lb/>per 10 simulated sites. The rates were normalized by the average <lb/>inferred rate in the sequence. <lb/>To assess the effect of other measurement matrices, we performed <lb/>similar inferences on the simulated alignments. For each simulated <lb/>alignment, we inferred site-wise rates five times, once each for the <lb/>matrices JTT, WAG, and LG, and twice for the JC-like matrix, using <lb/>different assumptions of equilibrium amino acid frequencies.

			<body>D <lb/>R A F T <lb/>JTT, WAG, and LG, the equilibrium frequencies were assumed to <lb/>be equal to the observed amino-acid frequencies. For JC, we inferred <lb/>rates once under the same assumption about equilibrium frequences, <lb/>and once under the assumption that the equilibrium frequency for <lb/>each amino acid is 1/20, the assumption made in the theoretical <lb/>derivations. Both assumptions yield almost identical rates (Figure <lb/>S4). We inferred one rate per physical site (no duplicates were <lb/>simulated). For each alignment, the final rates were normalized by <lb/>their mean. <lb/>When the true model was assumed to be a codon MutSel model, <lb/>we translated codon sequences to amino acid sequences prior to <lb/>inference. To match branch lengths between codon and amino-acid <lb/>alignments, we multiplied codon times by 0.77, the expected number <lb/>of amino-acid substitutions per nucleotide substitution according <lb/>to the genetic code. We inferred site-wise rates with the JC-like <lb/>matrix and uniform amino-acid frequencies. For each site, one joint <lb/>rate was inferred from the site&apos;s duplicates. For each alignment, the <lb/>final rates were normalized by their mean. <lb/></body>
