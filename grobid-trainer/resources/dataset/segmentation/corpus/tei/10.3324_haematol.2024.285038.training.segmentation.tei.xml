Some studies have, however, reported strokes in children with <lb/>SCD but without CA. In order to better understand the etiology and risk factors of these strokes, we retrospectively analyzed <lb/>ischemic strokes occurring in a large cohort of children over a 13-year period. Between 2007 and 2020, 25 of 1,500 children <lb/>with SCD had an ischemic stroke in our center. Among them, 13 (52%) had CA, described as anatomical arterial stenosis, <lb/>while 12 (48%) did not. Patients with stroke without CA were older than patients with stroke attributed to SCD-CA (9.0 years <lb/>old vs. 3.6 years old; P=0.008), and more frequently had SC genotype (25% vs. 0%, respectively). Their strokes more fre-<lb/>quently involved the posterior circulation, with cerebellar involvement in 42%. Retained stroke etiologies in patients without <lb/>typical SCD-related CA were reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral fat embolism, arterial thrombosis or <lb/>thromboembolism, hyperviscosity, vasculitis in a context of infectious meningo-encephalitis, and severe hemodynamic <lb/>failure. No recurrence was observed in the 24 months following stroke, even though 67% of the patients in this group were <lb/>no longer receiving exchange transfusions. In conclusion, in a cohort of pediatric SCD patients with an efficient stroke <lb/>screening strategy, half of the ischemic strokes that occurred were related to causes other than CA. They affected a differ-<lb/>ent population of SCD children and systematic long-term transfusion programs may not be necessary in these cases. <lb/></front>

        <body>Introduction <lb/>Stroke is one of the most severe complications affecting <lb/>children with sickle cell disease (SCD), 1 occurring in about <lb/>7.4% of children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) by the age <lb/>of 14 years old in the absence of a preventive strategy. 2 <lb/>Children with SCA between 2 and 5 years of age have the <lb/>highest risk of ischemic stroke, with an incidence of 1% per <lb/>year. 3 Overt stroke is mainly related to chronic stenosis and <lb/>occlusion of large cerebral arteries in the anterior circulation <lb/>resulting from intimal thickening, 4,5 described as cerebral <lb/>arteriopathy (CA) related to SCD (SCD-CA). The internal <lb/>carotid, including its extracranial part, 6 middle cerebral, <lb/>and anterior cerebral arteries are often involved in isch-<lb/>emic stroke 7,8 and up to 71% of SCA patients with a history <lb/>of overt stroke have been reported to have large-vessel <lb/>arteriopathy in the anterior circulation territories. 9 Without <lb/>secondary prevention based on a long-term transfusion <lb/>program, the recurrence rate after a first ischemic stroke <lb/>is very high, reaching 67% for a mean observation period <lb/>of 9 years in the Powars study, with 50% of the events <lb/>occurring within 2 years after the initial event. 10 <lb/>Screening for SCD-CA is based on routine annual transcranial <lb/>Doppler sonography (TCD) for all children with SCA, starting <lb/>in the second year of life. In patients with abnormally high <lb/>blood flow velocity in one or more arteries, brain mag-<lb/>netic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance <lb/>angiography (MRA) are also performed to quantify se-<lb/>verity and to investigate possible parenchymal injury or <lb/>anatomical arterial stenosis. The primary stroke preven-<lb/>tion strategy consists in monthly transfusion or exchange <lb/>transfusion until normalization of blood flow on TCD and <lb/>sometimes regression of stenosis, if any, on MRA. 11 This <lb/>preventive strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of <lb/>ischemic stroke in children with SCA to less than 2% by <lb/>18 years of age. 12 <lb/>Although the natural history of CA in SCD is relatively well <lb/>known, as is its correlation with the risk of ischemic stroke, <lb/>several cases of ischemic stroke in children with SCD who <lb/>did not have &quot;typical&quot; SCD-CA, i.e. as described above, <lb/></body>

        <body>have been reported. 8,9,13,14 This suggests that other patho-<lb/>physiological processes may be present in SCD patients. <lb/>Indeed, SCD is responsible for a hypercoagulability state 13 <lb/>and a higher risk of severe bacterial infections, 15 which <lb/>can lead to neurological complications. Our study aimed <lb/>to investigate the prevalence of ischemic stroke without <lb/>abnormal TCD or anatomical stenosis of the intracranial <lb/>or cervical arteries in a large cohort of children with SCD. <lb/>The secondary objective was to provide an overview of the <lb/>etiological diagnoses of these ischemic strokes and to raise <lb/>questions regarding the specific therapeutic management <lb/>of these patients. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Patients <lb/>The SCD Referral Center at Robert Debre Hospital (Paris, <lb/>France) is in charge of an active list of 1,300 children with <lb/>SCD. All patients with SCA (homozygous or Sβ 0 genotype) <lb/>undergo routine annual TCD from 18-24 months of age. If <lb/>the TCD is abnormal, cerebral MRI is performed to com-<lb/>plete the neurological screening. In accordance with in-<lb/>ternational recommendations, patients with abnormal TCD <lb/>are re-evaluated in the next 3 months and, in the event <lb/>of persistent abnormality or pathological Doppler (&gt;200 <lb/>cm/s), transfusion therapy is promptly initiated. Around 15% <lb/>of the patients in our SCD cohort have the SC genotype <lb/>and are not involved in the routine screening for cerebral <lb/>vasculopathy, as recommended. 11 <lb/>In this study, we retrospectively analyzed data from all <lb/>patients with SCD (any genotype), aged 0-18 years who <lb/>had a stroke between 2007 and 2020. Stroke was defined <lb/>as an acute neurological deficit with a consistent recent <lb/>arterial infarction on brain MRI. Patients with hemorrhagic <lb/>stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, or posterior reversible <lb/>encephalopathy syndrome were excluded. <lb/>As SCD-related CA is a chronic CA involving the anterior <lb/>circulation, in this study only arteriopathies involving an <lb/>internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery or anterior <lb/>cerebral artery and with persisting MRA or TCD abnormal-<lb/>ity at 3 months after the stroke 16 were labeled SCD-CA. <lb/>Stroke was thus termed as &quot;typical&quot; if (i) associated with <lb/>SCD-related CA (SCD-CA) and (ii) located in the cerebral <lb/>territory of the identified stenosis or abnormal TCD. Stroke <lb/>was termed as &quot;atypical&quot; in patients who did not meet <lb/>these criteria. <lb/>Steady-state biological data were collected at least 4 weeks <lb/>before the stroke and at a distance from any clinical event <lb/>or therapeutic escalation. To evaluate the context in which <lb/>the stroke occurred we reviewed the results of biological <lb/>tests performed in the 24 hours preceding the neurological <lb/>episode, when available. <lb/>The study was approved by the local ethics advisory com-<lb/>mittee (registration number: 20200113123118) and oral in-<lb/>formation about the database and its use was provided to <lb/>the patients and their legal guardians. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>The results of the descriptive analysis were expressed as <lb/>numbers and percentages for categorical variables and as <lb/>quartiles for quantitative variables. Because of the relatively <lb/>small sample size, all statistical analyses were performed <lb/>using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney). Statistical sig-<lb/>nificance was set at P&lt;0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. <lb/>All the results of the statistical analyses were generated <lb/>using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.00). <lb/>Results <lb/>Between 2007 and 2020, 25 patients were managed for an <lb/>acute ischemic stroke at our Sickle Cell Referral Center. <lb/>In about half of the patients in our study (n=13/25), the <lb/>stroke was considered as &quot;typical&quot; in the context of SCD. <lb/>Although all of them were theoretically eligible for routine <lb/>screening for CA, six of the 13 patients had not actually <lb/>undergone TCD in the preceding 12 months: four were lost <lb/>to follow-up, one had just arrived from Africa and one <lb/>had failed to undergo adequate cerebral blood flow mea-<lb/>surement on TCD because of narrow temporal windows. <lb/>Among the seven patients with proper screening for CA, <lb/>six had normal TCD in the previous 12 months, but ab-<lb/>normalities after stroke occurrence, showing progression <lb/>of CA between the two screening examinations, and one <lb/>had known abnormal TCD and was undergoing chronic <lb/>exchange transfusion for stroke prevention at the time <lb/>of the neurological event. <lb/>In 12 patients (48%), the classical definition of stroke relat-<lb/>ed to SCD-CA was not met and the stroke was classified <lb/>as &quot;atypical&quot;. In this group, in the nine of 12 patients who <lb/>were eligible for routine screening for CA, i.e. patients <lb/>with SS and Sβ 0 genotype, seven had normal TCD and/or <lb/>cerebral MRI findings in the 12 months before the stroke <lb/>occurred. For the two patients without brain imaging in the <lb/>preceding 12 months, one had no temporal bone window <lb/>and the other had missed appointments. <lb/>While the majority of patients with stroke (80%) had a <lb/>homozygous genotype, SC genotype was more frequent <lb/>in the group with &quot;atypical&quot; strokes, 25% versus 0% in <lb/>the group with &quot;typical&quot; stroke. The main baseline char-<lb/>acteristics of the 25 patients prior to their strokes are <lb/>presented in Table 1. <lb/>Considering biological parameters, we observed a lower <lb/>leukocyte count and a lower percentage of fetal hemoglo-<lb/>bin (HbF) in the group with &quot;atypical&quot; strokes compared to <lb/>the group with &quot;typical&quot; strokes (11.3x10 9 /L vs. 15.8x10 9 /L, <lb/>P=0.04 and 6.2% vs. 13.2% P=0.01, respectively), probably <lb/>related to the older age and higher proportion of children <lb/>with SC genotype in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group. <lb/></body>

        <body>Stroke characteristics <lb/>The median age at stroke onset was significantly higher in <lb/>the group with &quot;atypical&quot; strokes than in the group with <lb/>&quot;typical&quot; strokes, being 9.0 years of age versus 3.6 years of <lb/>age (P=0.008). While clinical presentation was similar in the <lb/>two groups with hemiplegia and/or language impairment <lb/>and, in some patients, headaches, seizures and impaired <lb/>consciousness, stroke occurred in significantly different set-<lb/>tings. In the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group, seven of the 12 strokes <lb/>(58%) occurred during or shortly after a hospital stay in the <lb/>intensive care unit (ICU) for delayed hemolytic transfusion <lb/>reaction (n=1), severe parvovirus B19 infection with bone <lb/>marrow necrosis and macrophage activation syndrome <lb/>(n=1), severe acute chest syndrome (n=2), decompensated <lb/>nephrotic syndrome (n=1), decompensated septic shock <lb/>(n=1), or hospitalization for a procedure requiring general <lb/>anesthesia (n=1). Conversely, in the &quot;typical&quot; stroke group, <lb/>only one child was in the ICU at stroke onset, the reason <lb/>being acute chest syndrome. Notably, three children in the <lb/>&quot;atypical&quot; stroke group had received intravenous cortico-<lb/>steroids during the 2 weeks preceding the stroke compared <lb/>to only one in the &quot;typical&quot; stroke group. The symptoms <lb/>accompanying the event, i.e. hypoxia, acute anemia, fever, <lb/>and vaso-occlusive crisis did not differ between the two <lb/>groups. Stroke characteristics are summarized in Table 2. <lb/>Laboratory assessments showed that in the &quot;atypical&quot; <lb/>stroke group, hemoglobin levels at the time of the stroke <lb/>were significantly higher than in the &quot;typical&quot; stroke group <lb/>at 11.0 g/dL versus 7.4 g/dL (P=0.027). Notably, 58% of the <lb/>children in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group had hemoglobin <lb/>levels above 10.5 g/dL at the time of the stroke, which <lb/>can lead to a risk of increased blood viscosity in patients <lb/>with SCD. <lb/>Infarct location and acute management <lb/>In accordance with the common topography of CA and <lb/>ischemic strokes in children with SCD, 92% of the children <lb/>in the group with &quot;typical&quot; strokes had ischemic lesions in <lb/>the territory of the anterior cerebral circulation and 100% <lb/>of them had, by definition, arterial stenosis in an artery <lb/>upstream of the ischemic territory on three-dimensional, <lb/>time-of-flight MRA, i.e. within the anterior cerebral circu-<lb/>lation, specifically the cervical internal carotid, intracranial <lb/>internal carotid, middle cerebral or anterior cerebral arteries. <lb/>In contrast, patients in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group present-<lb/>ed ischemic lesions in the territory of the vertebro-basilar <lb/>arterial circulation in 42% of cases.

        <body>In the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group, arterial abnormalities on <lb/>three-dimensional, time-of-flight MRA were observed in <lb/>four of the 12 patients. Two patients had diffuse arterial <lb/>caliber abnormalities in both the anterior and posterior <lb/>brain circulation (patients 1 and 2; Table 3), one patient had <lb/>major bilateral arterial thrombosis of the carotid arteries, <lb/>the left middle cerebral and the left anterior cerebral ar-<lb/>teries with a downstream ischemic lesion (patient 3), and <lb/>one patient had thrombosis of the basilar artery with a <lb/>downstream ischemic lesion (patient 4). For the remaining <lb/>eight patients in this group, no arterial abnormalities were <lb/>found on MRA at the time of the stroke or 3 months after. <lb/>Acute stroke management was globally similar in the two <lb/>groups (Table 3). <lb/>Etiologies of &quot;atypical&quot; strokes <lb/>When the cerebral ischemic lesions identified on cerebral <lb/>MRI after the stroke were in the territory of an artery whose <lb/>blood flow continued to be abnormally high on TCD and/ <lb/>or when persistent stenosis was identified on cerebral <lb/>MRI, the patient was considered to have a &quot;typical&quot; stroke <lb/>related to CA in SCD. <lb/>If not, various other etiological mechanisms of stroke were <lb/>discussed in multidisciplinary team meetings. Overall, six <lb/>different diagnoses were put forward for the 12 patients <lb/>with &quot;atypical&quot; stroke (see Table 3, with a selection of rel-<lb/>evant images in Figure 1). <lb/>Two patients had a diagnosis of reversible cerebral vaso-<lb/>constriction syndrome (RCVS). RCVS is a clinical-radio-<lb/>logical entity typically seen in middle-aged women and <lb/>is relatively rare in children; it is associated with acute <lb/>&quot;thunderclap&quot; headaches with multifocal alternation of <lb/>segmental narrowing and dilatation of the cerebral arteries <lb/>on angiography (MRA, computed tomography angiography <lb/>or conventional angiography). These radiological abnormal-<lb/>ities are reversible in 1 to 3 months. A triggering factor is <lb/>often reported. One of our cases (patient 1; Table 3) was <lb/>a 4-year-old girl with Sβ 0 SCA hospitalized in the ICU for <lb/>a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.

        <body>posterior stroke 72 hours after beginning the corticosteroid <lb/>therapy and died 2 days later. <lb/>One patient had a stroke in a context of infectious me-<lb/>ningo-encephalitis due to pneumococcus with systemic <lb/>inflammatory syndrome (patient 11; Table 3, Figure 1D). <lb/>Another patient, a 5-year-old boy with SS genotype (patient <lb/>12; Table 3) had a hemodynamic stroke related to systemic <lb/>hemodynamic failure. During hospitalization for a painful <lb/>vaso-occlusive crisis, he had a generalized seizure during a <lb/>sudden episode of hypotension requiring volume resuscita-<lb/>tion, after inhalation of an equimolar mixture of oxygen and <lb/>nitrous oxide (EMONO) used as a painkiller. The stroke was <lb/>confirmed on MRI showing ischemia of the antero-poste-<lb/>rior watershed territories (Figure 1E). In the absence of any <lb/>other etiology to explain the sudden drop in blood pressure, <lb/>EMONO use was incriminated as a diagnosis of exclusion <lb/>and the stroke was considered of iatrogenic origin. <lb/>Lastly, in two cases the main etiologic factor was con-<lb/>sidered to be blood hyperviscosity, based on a combi-<lb/>nation of clinical, laboratory and radiological features. <lb/>Indeed, both patients had hemoglobin levels &gt;13 g/dL and <lb/>hematocrit higher than 35% at the time of the stroke. <lb/>One patient, a 2-year-old boy with SS genotype, had a <lb/>relapse of nephrotic syndrome treated with corticoste-<lb/>roid therapy and blood transfusion, with hyperleukocy-<lb/>tosis at 48x10 9 /L 24 hours before stroke onset (patient <lb/>9; Table 3). MRI showed ischemic-hemorrhagic lesions <lb/>of the centrum semiovale. The second patient (patient <lb/>8; Table 3), a 14-year-old girl with SC genotype, had a <lb/>stroke within minutes of waking up, with aphasia and <lb/>right hemiparesis. Her first blood analysis showed a he-<lb/>moglobin of 13.6 g/dL, 3 g higher than her baseline level. <lb/>MRI revealed ischemia in the deep left middle cerebral <lb/>artery territory indicating involvement of perforating ar-<lb/>teries, potentially related to hyperviscosity (Figure 1F). <lb/>The only observation was the administration of intranasal <lb/>vasoconstrictor therapy the evening before; however, the <lb/>causal relationship was not confirmed. <lb/>Long-term treatment and outcome <lb/>Excepting the patient with a delayed hemolytic transfusion <lb/>reaction, all patients received monthly exchange transfu-<lb/>sions for at least 6 months after the acute phase. <lb/>Among the ten patients surviving 12 months after the stroke, <lb/>100% of children with &quot;typical&quot; stroke were still receiving <lb/>monthly exchange transfusions, whereas 40% (4/10) of <lb/>the children with &quot;atypical&quot; stroke were considered not <lb/>to require exchange transfusions any longer as their MRA <lb/>findings were normal (Figure 3). One child in this group <lb/>was lost to follow-up. <lb/>Two years after the stroke, all but one patient with a <lb/>&quot;typical&quot; stroke were still receiving exchange transfusions <lb/>due to persistent cerebral arterial stenosis. One patient <lb/>stopped the exchange transfusions because of bone mar-<lb/>row transplantation. <lb/>In the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group, 2 years after the stroke, 70% <lb/>(7/10) of the children were no longer receiving exchange <lb/>transfusions (Figure 3). The three remaining patients were <lb/>still receiving monthly exchange transfusions due to cor-<lb/>ticosteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in one case, <lb/>occurrence of stroke on hydroxyurea therapy with elevated <lb/>hemoglobin with no other apparent contributing factors in <lb/>one case, and appearance of SCD-related CA contralat-<lb/>eral to the ischemic territory in the last case. Among the <lb/>seven patients who stopped the transfusion program, four <lb/>received, or continued to receive, treatment with hydroxy-<lb/>urea, the other three children had SC genotype. <lb/>Overall, the rate of neurological sequelae was similar in the <lb/>two groups, with motor deficiency in 65% of patients and <lb/>cognitive impairment in 61%. No recurrence of stroke was <lb/>observed in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group, including among <lb/>the patients who had stopped the transfusion program, <lb/>whereas 38% (n=5) of the patients with &quot;typical&quot; stroke had <lb/>a further stroke in the following 2 years despite monthly <lb/>exchange transfusion.

        <body>currence of stroke had Moya-Moya, underlying the strong <lb/>correlation between Moya-Moya and risk of recurrence of <lb/>stroke in SCD. 17 <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Cerebral arteriopathy, described as stenosis of one or more <lb/>cerebral arteries in the circle of Willis occurring in children <lb/>with SCA between 2 and 15 years of age, is known to be <lb/>the main etiology of ischemic stroke in SCD patients. Nev-<lb/>ertheless, our study shows that ischemic stroke can also <lb/>occur in children with SCD with genotypes other than SS <lb/>or Sβ 0 , and in patients without &quot;typical&quot; CA. In the past 15 <lb/>years in our referral SCD center, almost half of the strokes <lb/>in SCD children were due to an etiology other than SCD-as-<lb/>sociated CA, which led us to question the circumstances <lb/>of these strokes, their etiologies, the patients at risk and <lb/>the appropriate long-term treatments. <lb/>The prevalence of stroke in our cohort is low compared to <lb/>the number of patients followed in our SCD Referral Center, <lb/>i.e. 25 strokes in 15 years in an active database of around <lb/>1,300 patients per year. The proportion of strokes without CA <lb/>may appear high at 12/25 cases; however, the two results can <lb/>be explained by the routine implementation of preventive <lb/>measures to screen for CA, which has drastically reduced the <lb/>number of strokes due to undiagnosed CA in SCA children <lb/>over the past 15 years. 12,18 Paradoxically, this highly effective <lb/>strategy for reducing the risk of stroke in children with SCA <lb/>highlights the risk of stroke in other patients with SCD, in <lb/>whom it is more difficult to prevent. As regards the profile <lb/>of pre-stroke patients, on the whole they are patients with a <lb/>mild disease (4% had more than 3 hospitalized vaso-occlu-<lb/>sive crises in the past 12 months and 28% had been treated <lb/>with hydroxyurea). The only criterion of severity we found <lb/>surprisingly high was the rate of history of acute splenic <lb/>sequestration (44% in the whole cohort of patients, 58% in <lb/>the group with &quot;atypical&quot; vasculopathy). Recently, our group <lb/>published findings on the consequences of early splenec-<lb/>tomy in a large cohort of children with SCA and showed an <lb/>increased proportion of cerebral vasculopathy in children with <lb/>early splenic dysfunction who were splenectomized before <lb/>3 years old. 19 This relation between splenic dysfunction and <lb/>neurological complications in children should probably be <lb/>investigated further. <lb/>Apart from those with cerebral arteriopathy, which <lb/>children with sickle cell disease are at risk of stroke? <lb/>The first conclusion of our study is that stroke without CA <lb/>can occur in children older than expected, at a median of 9 <lb/>years of age and maximum of 15 years old in our study. As <lb/>expected, patients with SCA had the highest risk of stroke, 3 <lb/>but stroke can also occur in patients with SC genotype <lb/>(3/12 in our study). The second important observation is <lb/>that 58% of the children in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke group were <lb/>hospitalized in the ICU for another reason at stroke onset <lb/>or had been in the preceding week. This suggests that <lb/>acute complications related to SCD can aggravate baseline <lb/>vascular instability, coagulation disorders, and precarious <lb/>tissue oxygenation, thus promoting cerebral ischemia. Our <lb/>results are consistent with published studies, including that <lb/>by Kwiatkowski et al., 14 who reported that 57% of ischemic <lb/>strokes occur as part of a recent medical event in SCD <lb/>children with a low risk of stroke. Particular clinical circum-<lb/>stances such as corticosteroid therapy, severe infections <lb/>or severe pulmonary dysfunction represented half of the <lb/>secondary stroke settings in our study, even after efficient <lb/>transfusion therapy leading to HbS levels below 30%. <lb/>For various reasons, children with SCD have a lower cerebro-<lb/>vascular reserve compared to healthy controls, i.e. a reduced <lb/>capacity of their cerebral vessels to dilate in response to <lb/>increased requirements. 20 Moreover, SCD is characterized <lb/>by basal endothelial dysfunction related to chronic inflam-<lb/>mation, which promotes long-term vascular wall thicken-<lb/>ing and, potentially, inappropriate vascular response. 13 The <lb/>ischemic lesions observed in our study may be due to local <lb/>phenomena affecting cerebral blood flow through vascular <lb/>wall damage and/or arterial obstruction, often in a systemic <lb/>context that itself promotes cerebral hypoperfusion (acute <lb/>anemia or acute hypoxia). 21,22 Conversely, increased blood <lb/>viscosity was suspected to be implicated in two cases of <lb/>stroke in our study and has been reported as responsible <lb/>for complications in SCD. 23,24 Given the underlying vascular <lb/>dysfunction, the impaired microcirculation may be unable <lb/>to compensate for a rapid increase in hemoglobin level by <lb/>increasing vascular resistance and promoting red blood cell <lb/>aggregation. 25 In addition, major hyperleukocytosis promot-<lb/>ed by inflammation or corticosteroid therapy may increase <lb/>blood viscosity. 26,27 Involvement of leukocytes, particularly <lb/>neutrophils, in vascular and organ damage, including stroke, <lb/>in SCD patients is well described above counts of 20 x10 9 /L. 28 <lb/>Inflammation could also promote increased adhesion of <lb/>white blood cells to the endothelial wall, contributing to <lb/>reduced blood flow and vascular damage. 29 <lb/>Necrosis of bone marrow in the long bones adds an em-<lb/>bolic risk of another nature via the cerebral fat embolism <lb/>syndrome. This follows the release into the systemic cir-<lb/>culation of fatty lobules associated with extensive bone <lb/>marrow infarction. Classically, patients in this situation <lb/>present with signs of respiratory failure and encephalopa-<lb/>thy associated with pancytopenia. In the majority of cases <lb/>(80%), patients have a non-SS genotype. A background of <lb/>parvovirus B19 infection is found in 24% of cases in patients <lb/>with SCD and fat embolism. 30 <lb/>Among our patients with &quot;atypical&quot; stroke, we identified <lb/>two cases of RCVS, a rare vascular disorder of imperfectly <lb/>understood etiology, characterized by diffuse sudden vaso-<lb/>constriction of the cerebral arterial vasculature, sometimes <lb/>associated with neurological deficits due to hemorrhage <lb/>or infarct, and spontaneous reversibility in 1 to 3 months. <lb/></body>

        <body>The best described predisposing factors are physical ex-<lb/>ercise, immersion in cold water, the Valsalva maneuver <lb/>(forced expiration with a closed glottis) or vasoconstrictor <lb/>treatment. 31 In SCD, several underlying risk factors may <lb/>increase the risk of RCVS, such as blood viscosity fluctua-<lb/>tions, disrupted regulation of vascular tone and endothelial <lb/>dysfunction. Transfusion is also an identified risk factor in <lb/>SCD children, 32,33 as are corticosteroids and immunomod-<lb/>ulatory therapies. Lastly, exposure to cannabinoids, known <lb/>to be a potential trigger, 34 should be considered in the case <lb/>of RCVS in a SCD patient. <lb/>Overall, this suggests that, in the absence of CA, SCD itself, <lb/>its complications and sometimes the therapies required <lb/>may be additional factors for stroke in these patients. Any <lb/>SCD child who experiences a variation in blood viscosity, <lb/>acute severe inflammatory reaction or hypotension should <lb/>be considered at risk of ischemic stroke. <lb/>What long-term treatment for sickle cell disease <lb/>children with stroke without cerebral arteriopathy? <lb/>In accordance with guidelines, 35 all patients were managed <lb/>in the acute phase to reduce HbS below 30%, regardless <lb/>of the presumed mechanism of the stroke or the SCD <lb/>genotype, in order to improve cerebral perfusion. In the <lb/>same perspective, in the absence of consensus guidelines, <lb/>antiplatelet therapy was added when platelet levels were <lb/>&gt;450 x10 9 /L in all the patients in our cohort and in both <lb/>groups, to prevent thrombotic complications. <lb/>In patients without arterial stenosis, the rationale of main-<lb/>taining a long-term transfusion program may be questioned. <lb/>During the first 6 months, we considered that the benefit <lb/>of long-term exchange transfusion, by maintaining an HbS <lb/>rate below 30% and a total hemoglobin level around 10 g/ <lb/>dL, was to facilitate the recovery of the cerebral parenchy-<lb/>ma, and to limit neurological sequelae. Thus, taking into <lb/>account the transient nature of the precipitating factors <lb/>as well as potential adverse effects and constraints of this <lb/>therapy, in most of the patients in the &quot;atypical&quot; stroke <lb/>group, we decided to interrupt the transfusion program <lb/>when arterial stenosis or other identified risk factors for <lb/>stroke recurrence were absent. <lb/>No acute neurological events were reported in the 24 months <lb/>following the stroke in the cohort of patients with &quot;atypical&quot; <lb/>strokes whereas, in the &quot;typical&quot; stroke group, recurrent <lb/>seizures were reported in 46% of patients (P=0.045) and <lb/>recurrent strokes in 38% (P=0.034) despite the continua-<lb/>tion of exchange transfusion programs. The risk of stroke <lb/>recurrence is known to be very high in children with CA in <lb/>the absence of a transfusion program, 36 however, our small <lb/>descriptive study suggests that, following &quot;atypical&quot; stroke, <lb/>exchange transfusions can be stopped on a case-by-case <lb/>basis, with no major risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, hy-<lb/>droxyurea treatment should be systematically considered <lb/>for these patients, in order to prevent future complications <lb/>that may again lead to an atypical stroke. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Although CA is the main etiology of ischemic stroke in <lb/>children with SCA, at least in those who do not receive <lb/>primary stroke prevention, the occurrence of stroke without <lb/>arterial stenosis in SCD children is not rare, particularly in <lb/>adolescents and HbSC patients. These atypical strokes have <lb/>been happening all along, but they were probably missed <lb/>or under-appreciated or, before the advent of an effective <lb/>stroke prevention strategy, they constituted a minority of <lb/>events and were wrongly attributed to sickle cell-specif-<lb/>ic causes. Nevertheless, even in the absence of CA, SCD <lb/>seems to be a favorable terrain for other stroke etiologies <lb/>in children, which need to be explored and specifically <lb/>treated. Finally, even if silent ischemic strokes were not <lb/>the subject of this study, they fall within the scope of fre-<lb/>quent ischemic phenomena, the etiology of which remains <lb/>uncertain. 37,38 The same pathological processes should be <lb/>considered to explain them. <lb/>Atypical strokes seem to be facilitated by severe compli-<lb/>cations related to SCD. In the absence of specific guide-<lb/>lines, we suggest that any factors favoring hyperviscosity, <lb/>thrombosis or low cerebral blood flow should alert physi-<lb/>cians to the risk of stroke in a child with SCD. In second-<lb/>ary prevention, after the acute phase, stopping exchange <lb/>transfusion programs does not seem to increase the risk <lb/>of stroke recurrence. In the absence of arterial cerebral <lb/>stenosis, continuation of long-term transfusion programs <lb/>should be discussed on a case-by-case basis in order to <lb/>avoid side effects associated with chronic transfusions. <lb/></body>
