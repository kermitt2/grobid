			Abstract <lb/> The self-assembly of organic molecules (octylamine) is studied by means of periodic DFT calculations <lb/>including Grimme D2 dispersion scheme. It has been found that in the gas-phase dispersive forces <lb/>are crucial when packing is considered, modifying considerably the potential energy surface <lb/>compared to the case of a molecular dimer. In interaction with a metallic surface (platinum), the <lb/>electronic interaction between adsorbate and substrate is predominant, dispersion forces mainly <lb/>increasing the adsorption strength. A detailed study on the structural parameters of the molecule-<lb/>metal system is reported to gain understanding on the factors affecting their stability. The <lb/>intermolecular bonding in these systems is analyzed by means of the non-covalent interactions NCI <lb/>index. The decomposition of the 2D packing along each direction (x,y) highlights the importance of <lb/>the diagonal contributions in the stabilization of the square pattern. Moreover, the stabilizing nature <lb/>of H-H interactions between neighboring molecules is supported in this model. <lb/>Keywords: SAM, DFT, NCI, platinum, amine <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The binding of long alkyl chain molecules to metal surfaces is being deeply investigated for <lb/>application in many technological fields such as films, electronic junctions, tribology or coating [1]. <lb/>The stability of such systems is mainly due to a competition between metal-molecule and molecule-<lb/>molecule interactions, whose strength critically determines their physicochemical properties. For <lb/>instance, in gold/thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), the surface-molecule interaction must be <lb/>strong to immobilize the alkyl chains on the metal surface [1,2]. Another example is the synthesis of <lb/>metal nanoparticles in mild conditions, where the alkylamine chains are used as surfactant to <lb/>stabilize the metallic surface [3, 4]. Here, the metal-surface strength must be intermediate: if it is too <lb/>strong, the molecule blocks the surface site and the particle cannot grow further leading to small <lb/>nanocrystals, but if it is too weak the particle surface is not stabilized and it grows isotropically <lb/>leading to large spherical nanoparticles without control on the size or shape. Understanding the <lb/>nature and the strength of the interactions between surfaces and long chain molecules is thus of <lb/>great importance and may help in the design of systems with a specific molecule-surface and <lb/>molecule-molecule strengths. <lb/>The intermolecular interactions in SAMs come from the vicinity of the neighboring molecules that <lb/>form an ordered two-dimensional layer and are mainly caused by dispersion forces. The role of the <lb/>dispersion forces between the alkyl chains is poorly understood although it may become crucial in <lb/>the stabilization of the system. Dispersion forces are commonly estimated from different theoretical <lb/>approaches. Semi-hybrid functionals have been used to study thiol/gold SAMs [5]. Recently, the <lb/>implementation of the Grimme approach [6, 7] in solid state codes has allowed exploring their role in <lb/>adsorption systems. It has been found that the inclusion of Grimme DN corrections can significantly <lb/>affect the calculated geometry of adsorption as well as its strength [8]. Also, the self-assembling of <lb/>polymers in vacuo has been successfully described by using such approach [9]. In the last years, <lb/>dispersion in short alkyl chains assembly on metals has been studied with ab initio methods [10, 11]. <lb/>

			As regards bonding analysis on SAMs, the reactivity of the tail groups has been studied by conceptual <lb/>DFT methods [12] and the chemical bond between surfactant and surface studied with the electron <lb/>localization function ELF [13]. However, little is known about the weak interactions involved in the <lb/> packing of molecules, as in self-assembled monolayers on a solid surface. The aim of the present <lb/>paper is to highlight the crucial role of dispersion forces in the organization of long alkyl molecules in <lb/>two dimensions. It will be shown that in the gas-phase the energetic profile of a packing of molecules <lb/>is dramatically affected by such interactions. Standard Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations <lb/>are used combined with Grimme D2 approach. A bonding analysis based on Non Covalent <lb/>Interactions (NCI) index is applied to illustrate the nature of the intermolecular interactions. <lb/> 2. Models and methods <lb/> The platinum (100)-octylamine (NH 2 C 8 H 17 ) system has been chosen because it has been recently <lb/>reported to lead to stable cubic platinum nanoparticles [3, 14]. Such particles are synthesized in mild <lb/>conditions at the interface between an organic and an aqueous phase. The octylamine is used as <lb/>surfactant to stabilize the metal particle in the organic (toluene) phase. The particles obtained are <lb/>cubic and the metal will be modeled by a (100)-terminated five layers-thick slab. The octylamine is <lb/>investigated in the gas-phase as well as supported on the platinum slab in order to decompose the <lb/>parameters affecting stability: molecule-molecule distance, molecule packing, surface-molecule <lb/>distance and coverage. <lb/>The calculations are carried out with the revised Perdew Burke Ernzerhof [15, 16] functional as <lb/>implemented in the VASP code [17, 18]. Test calculations on the Pt fcc bulk lattice parameter and <lb/>cohesive energy are shown in Figure S1, they support the choice of rPBE+D2 level of theory. Projector <lb/>Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [19, 20] combined to plane waves (cutoff=400 eV) <lb/>represent the electronic distribution. An appropriate set of k-points is used to sample the Brillouin <lb/>zone. Periodic boundary conditions apply and a vacuum of at least 15 Å is included to avoid <lb/>

			interaction between successive layers. Starting from the gas-phase optimized geometry at the rPBE <lb/>level, calculations are done without geometrical optimization for the gas-phase studies and with the <lb/>conjugate-gradient algorithm for the surface-molecule interaction studies, with the geometrical <lb/>constrains specified in each case (see Table S1). The interaction energies are calculated by the <lb/> formula: <lb/>A+ B = [AB] where E int = E [AB]- E A -E B <lb/> thus negative for exothermic reactions. <lb/>Dispersion interactions are included by using the Grimme D2 approach as implemented in the VASP <lb/>code (parameters for Pt: radius=1.676 Å and C 6 =19.46 Jnm 6 mol -1 obtained from [7]). As noticed in the <lb/>literature [8], the problem of metal screening of dispersive forces can be roughly corrected by <lb/>including dispersion only on the uppermost slab layer. We have considered this possibility together <lb/>with the pure rPBE and full D2, denoted as 1L, rPBE and D2 respectively. Tests on the propilamine <lb/>dimer potential energy curve have been carried out at the MP2/6-311++g(3df,2pd), BSSE corrected, <lb/>together with the rPBE and rPBE+D2 levels, and show very good agreement with the rPBE+D2 setting <lb/>used in the present work, as can be seen in Figure S2. <lb/>It has been recently shown that although the energetic balance at weak interactions is cumbersome <lb/>to detect from energetics, the density (r) reconstruction by those methods is accurate enough to <lb/>reveal the interactions present in the system. This is the principle lying behind the recently reported <lb/>index for detecting Non-Covalent-Interactions, NCI [21]. This index enables the identification and <lb/>characterization of weak interactions of various strengths as chemically intuitive reduced density <lb/>gradient isosurfaces that reveal both stabilizing (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals) and destabilizing <lb/>(steric clashes) interactions. It can also be applied to ionic interactions [22]. In order to achieve a <lb/>better comprehension of the nature of bonding and packing, representative systems will be studied <lb/>by means of the NCI method. The NCI analysis has been carried out with the critic2 code [23] and <lb/>visualized in VMD [24]. <lb/>

			3. Results and discussion <lb/> We have chosen to investigate independently the key factors in the stabilization of the system <lb/>surface-molecule so we can derive the nature and the strength of the forces responsible for each <lb/>interaction. Thus, we have computed the gas-phase molecule-molecule interaction as regards their <lb/>interatomic distance, the relative orientation and the packing effect. Then, we have studied the <lb/>surface-molecule interaction concerning the adsorption site, the distance surface-molecule, the <lb/>tilting angle and the coverage. <lb/>3.1 The molecule-molecule interaction in the gas-phase <lb/>The potential energy surface of an octylamine dimer in the gas-phase is presented in Figure 1. It can <lb/>be seen that the curve decays asymptotically and reaches a minimum for a distance of 5.5 Å (rPBE) <lb/>and 5.0 Å (D2). The energy gain with respect to the isolated molecule in the gas-phase is almost <lb/>athermic for rPBE and only slightly exothermic, -0.12 eV, for D2. Compared to the propilamine results <lb/>(Figure S2), the energy gain is of 0.05 eV. Such gain is due to the longest alkyl chain that increases the <lb/>dispersive interactions. <lb/>The packing effect of the molecule on the surface has been calculated by considering the molecule in <lb/>a tetragonal unit cell repeated in three dimensions. The a parameter is modified so as to consider the <lb/>distance between consecutive neighboring molecules. The curves obtained, presented in Figure 1, <lb/>show a behavior similar to that of the dimer for the pure rPBE functional. Instead, a qualitative <lb/>change is observed for the D2 calculations: a minimum in the curve appears at a distance of 4.5 Å, <lb/>with an energy gain of -0.28 eV. Therefore, dispersion forces seem to be crucial for representing <lb/>packing in two-dimensions in the gas-phase. <lb/>

Right: profile for a square 2D packed <lb/>system (one molecule in the unit cell). <lb/>3.2 Molecule-surface interaction <lb/>The adsorption site preferred for the NH 2 C 8 H 17 molecule is a quasi-top site [14], as found also for NH 3 <lb/> [25]. Concerning the molecule orientation on the surface, previous calculations on Au/thiol SAMs <lb/>show that the alkyl chains are not perpendicular to the surface but tilted [26-28], and is also the case <lb/>in Ag/thiol systems [29]. Our calculated value for the tilting angle a (see Figure 2) is ~23 deg (rPBE), <lb/>~27 deg (D2) with a gain in energy of -0.33 eV (rPBE) -0.55 eV (D2) with respect to the molecule <lb/>perpendicular to the slab. Also, the relative orientation of the molecule with respect to the surface <lb/>sites has been explored through the radial angle beta, 45 deg being the optimal angle for all the <lb/>methods (see Figure 2). The system is much less sensitive to this radial angle than to the tilting angle, <lb/>the gain in energy is small (0.09 eV for rPBE, 0.05 eV for rPBE+D2). <lb/>

Left: tilting angle to the vertical a (side view) Right: radial angle b (top view) <lb/>The coverage effect has been investigated for coverage values q from 0.11 to 0.5. The coverage is <lb/>defined as the number of molecules per surface Pt atom as in Table 1. For all the coverages <lb/>considered the adsorption occurs on a quasi-top position, the platinum atom to which the amine is <lb/>bonded slightly moving upwards. The most favorable adsorption energy is found for q=0.125, and <lb/>becomes less favorable as the coverage increases. For a coverage of q= 0.5 the amine is almost <lb/>vertical to the surface, but as the coverage decreases the tilting angle increases reaching values <lb/>around 30 deg. This is an indication of the higher intermolecular interaction occurring when the <lb/>molecules are close to each other (high coverage). Low coverage involves almost exclusively <lb/>molecule-surface interaction due to long distances between neighboring molecules. The Pt-N <lb/>distance is higher than 2 Å in all cases. <lb/>

			Figure 3. Energy profile for the molecule-surface interactions as a function of the coverage (left) and <lb/>Pt-N distance (right). Lines are a guide for the eye. <lb/>In order to investigate the interaction between the molecule and the surface we have selected the <lb/>coverage q=0.25. At this coverage the adsorption energy is quite exothermic and the neighboring <lb/>molecules interact at a distance of 5.65 Å which means that the adsorbate-substrate interaction is <lb/>predominant. We have studied the potential energy curves for the molecule as a function of the <lb/>distance with the surface, d Pt-N , keeping the geometry fixed. Figure 3 right displays the curve <lb/>obtained. The rPBE calculations lead to a shallow minima (d Pt-N =2.2-2.4 Å, E int = -0.39 eV). The D2 <lb/>calculations result in a deeper well (d Pt-N =2.2 Å, E int =-1.26 eV). The 1L calculations lie in between the <lb/>curves (d Pt-N =2.2 Å , E int =-1.14 eV), closer to the full D2 values. It can be concluded that the <lb/>equilibrium distance between the octylamine and the Pt slab is around 2.2 Å, which indicates a <lb/>physisorption. The adsorption energy is moderate, around -1.2 eV when considering dispersion <lb/>forces and -0.39 eV at the rPBE level. Dispersion is therefore more important in the energetics of <lb/>adsorption, which results in a significant increase from -0.39 eV to -1.2 eV, than in the geometry, that <lb/>results in a slightly shorter Pt-N bond upon inclusion of the Grimme correction. <lb/> -1.2 <lb/>-1.0 <lb/>-0.8 <lb/>-0.6 <lb/>-0.4 <lb/>-0.2 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>4.5 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>6.5 <lb/>7.5 <lb/>rPBE <lb/>rPBE+D2 <lb/>rPBE+D2+1L <lb/> DE vs distance Pt-N <lb/>coverage <lb/> DE <lb/> in eV <lb/> d Pt-N /Å <lb/> q <lb/> E <lb/> ads in eV <lb/> -1.50 <lb/>-1.00 <lb/>-0.50 <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.50 <lb/>1.00 <lb/>1.50 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/> rPBE D2 1L <lb/>

			As shown in Section 3.1, Figure 1, the gas-phase packing of octylamine molecules leads to a <lb/>significant stabilization of the square 2D arrangement. In the ordered superstructure the interaction <lb/>between neighboring molecules depend on the relative orientation. Figure 4 displays the relative <lb/>orientation of two neighboring octylamines in the x and y directions. It can be observed that they are <lb/>not equivalent since they involve different H-H interactions. Along the y direction, octylamine <lb/>molecules are oriented in such a way that the hydrogen atoms in the chains face those of the <lb/>neighboring molecule. Instead, there is no such orientation when molecules arrange along the x <lb/>direction and hydrogens are not face to face. <lb/>A closer look at the geometries enables understanding that this difference comes from a different <lb/>geometrical arrangement (Figure 4). In these figures, the y alignment is clearly different than the x <lb/>one as regards H-H interactions. In order to gain more information on the role of the relative <lb/>orientation of the two chains, we have considered polymers of octylamine in the x and y directions <lb/>separately. Tests on the propilamine dimer at MP2 level are displayed in Figure S3. They indicate that <lb/>the x dimer is slightly more stable than the y one (-0.054 eV for x, -0.04 eV for y), and the equilibrium <lb/> 
			
			<page>11 <lb/></page> 
			
			intermolecular distance is longer for the former (4.7 Å vs 4.4 Å). The same system calculated at the <lb/>rPBE+D2 level gives x and y dimers almost isoenergetic (-0.05 eV) with d NN distaces at equilibrium of <lb/>4.8 Å (x) 4.4 Å (y). This indicates a slight overestimation of the y interactions compared to the x ones <lb/>in the D2 approach used. <lb/>Figure S4 shows the energetic profile of 1D polymers along x and y directions as a function of the <lb/>distance between neighboring molecules d NN . It can be observed that the stabilization in the <lb/>alignment along y direction is higher than in the x direction which is in part due to the method as we <lb/>have seen above. Comparing now the 2D pattern to the addition of x and y polymers (Figure S3 right) <lb/>the result is a net stabilization of the 2D square pattern with respect to the addition of x plus y, <lb/>almost inexistent for rPBE but significant when using the D2 approach. Although the method used <lb/>overstabilizes the interactions in the y direction, the overall stabilization of the 2D pattern compared <lb/>to the sum of the polymers is significant. This result highlights the key role of second neighbors in the <lb/>stabilization of the squared superstructure. <lb/>Figure 4.

			The relative orientation of the neighbors plays thus a key role in stabilizing extended systems. In <lb/>order to have a better insight on the energetics we have calculated the energy profile of a gas-phase <lb/>octylamine dimer as a function of the relative orientation of the two molecules. It can be seen in <lb/>Figure S4 that the molecules rotated c=80 deg in the z-axis is the most favourable situation. This <lb/>orientation is similar to the one obtained for the y-polymer that would correspond to c=90 deg <lb/>(Figure 4, right). On the other side, having the molecules face to face, c=0 deg, is less favourable and <lb/>corresponds to the x-polymer in Figure 4 left. Note that both the rPBE and D2-corrected series give <lb/>very similar energetic profiles. <lb/>3.4 Bonding <lb/>In order to understand the effects of these geometrical arrangements at the bonding level, we have <lb/>carried out NCI calculations at the rPBE+D2 level. Figure 5 shows the isocontour plots of the NCI <lb/>index of the octylamine molecule polymer model along the x and y directions. Note that NCI is very <lb/>little affected by the level of calculation at a given geometry: the same features are found with the <lb/>MP2 curves of the propylamine dimer, see Figure 5 right. The reduced density s vs  r  diagrams for the <lb/>three systems can be found in Figure S5. <lb/>

			Figure 5: NCI isocountours (in green) for the interaction of octylamines in periodic systems as found <lb/>for the the x and y polymers and the square 2D packed system. <lb/>As expected, NCI isosurfaces are anisotropic, differentiating between delocalized and localized <lb/>interactions along x and y directions respectively. The symmetric arrangement along the y direction <lb/>gives rise to localized H-H interactions between them, whereas delocalized H-CH 2 interactions appear <lb/>along the x direction. The directionality of H-H interactions is characterized within the NCI approach <lb/>by the small, round shape of the regions and the strength by the relatively large accumulation of <lb/>electron density. Weak interactions such as the ones found in the x polymer give rise to interaction <lb/>regions, rather than localized NCI domains, and present a relatively low electron density. In both <lb/>cases, the colour of the NCI isosurfaces reveals the weak non-bonding nature of all the interactions, <lb/>which agrees with the need to resort to D2 corrections to account for them. <lb/>Moreover, the stabilizing effect of H-H interactions along the y direction raises a fundamental <lb/>problem in crystal packing, which is still an open question. These interactions are usually assumed to <lb/> 
			
			<page>14 <lb/></page> 
			
			give rise to steric clashes, and contribute to the destabilization of the crystal. However, topological <lb/>approaches such as QTAIM point towards their stabilizing nature. <lb/>The H–H BCPs were first interpreted by Cioslowski and Mixon in kekulene [30] and ortho-substituted <lb/>biphenyls [31] and assigned to &apos;&apos;non-bonded repulsive contacts&apos;&apos;, a view supported by later studies <lb/>with different energy partitions [32, 33]. QTAIM atomic energies, on the other hand, predict a <lb/>stabilization caused by H–H contacts of up to 10 kcal/mol in the general case of polybenzenoid <lb/>molecules [34] . It should be noted that the weakness of dihydrogen interactions and the <lb/>arbitrariness in the choice of energy partition precludes determining how much these interactions <lb/>contribute to the total binding energy of a crystal, so it would be extremely difficult to determine in <lb/>an unbiased manner the strength and character of these interactions, except in those cases where <lb/>the total stabilization is to a good approximation, only given by those interactions. This is the case of <lb/>the y polymer. Being hydrogen interactions the main source of interaction in the y direction (very <lb/>little dispersion is observed), the attractive interaction observed in this polymer can only be <lb/>attributed to H-H interactions. <lb/>In the case of octylamine 2D square packing, the stabilizing nature of H-H interactions in the y <lb/> direction is supported by i) the presence of clear NCI maps regions instead of atom-atom contacts <lb/>and ii) the energetic curves obtained after inclusion of the D2 Grimme correction. <lb/>From the visual analysis of NCI isosurfaces of the linear polymers and the 2D arrangement (Figure 5), <lb/>the x and y components are perfectly recovered, along with an extra region between interactions <lb/>along x and y direction. This interaction between diagonal elements of the arrangement, may be <lb/>identified as the responsible of its relative stability. In other words, the additive effect of the diagonal <lb/>interactions is related to packing. It is interesting to note that once again, these interactions are <lb/>dispersive-like, which explains why they are so difficult to track in solids. The use of NCI index allows <lb/>therefore revealing the packing interactions in a visual way and provides a new tool to analyse <lb/>dispersion interactions in extended systems. <lb/>

			4. Conclusion <lb/> A combined periodic DFT and NCI approach has been used to describe the geometry, energetics and <lb/>bonding in a model of self-assembled monolayer octylamine-platinum. The dispersion effects are <lb/>found to play a major role in the molecular packing energetics and a moderate effect in the <lb/>adsorption geometry. We have been able to identify the stabilizing nature of dispersive H-H <lb/>interactions in packing thanks to the NCI index. The NCI analysis combined with dispersive <lb/>corrections in standard DFT calculations are thus powerful tools to understand molecular packing in <lb/>extended systems. <lb/>
