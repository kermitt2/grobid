			<body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>The formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are a family of G <lb/>protein-coupled receptors that play an important role in <lb/>host defense and inflammation (Migeotte et al., 2006; Ye <lb/>et al., 2009). Three different isoforms are known in hu-<lb/>mans: FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. FPR1, the first receptor of <lb/>the family to be identified, was discovered for its ability to <lb/>transduce the chemotactic effect of a formylated bacterial <lb/>product, formyl-methionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF; <lb/>Boulay et al., 1990). FPR1 is mainly expressed in cells of <lb/></body>

Therefore, FPRs <lb/>represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of both cancer and in-<lb/>flammatory diseases. Previously, we identified selective or mixed FPR agonists with <lb/>pyridazinone or pyridinone scaffolds showing a common 4-(bromophenyl)acetamide <lb/>fragment, which was essential for activity. We report here new pyrazole and pyra-<lb/>zolone derivatives as restricted analogues of the above 6-membered compounds, all <lb/>exhibiting the same 4-bromophenylacetamide side chain. Most new products had <lb/>low or absent FPR agonist activity, suggesting that the pyrazole nucleus was not ap-<lb/>propriate for FPR agonists. This hypothesis was confirmed by molecular modeling <lb/>studies, which highlighted that the five-membered scaffold was responsible for a <lb/>worse arrangement of the molecules in the receptor binding site. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>Agonist, cancer, formyl peptide receptor, inflammation, neutrophil, pyrazole, pyrazolone <lb/></front>

			<body>the immune system, such as neutrophils and monocytes/mac-<lb/>rophages, but is also found in the lungs, brain, and gastroin-<lb/>testinal tract. FPR2 is distributed similarly to FPR1, but it <lb/>is also present in hepatocytes, pancreas, glial cells, and as-<lb/>trocytes (Compernolle et al., 2003; Lacy et al., 1995; Uhlen <lb/>et al., 2015). Finally, information about FPR3 is limited, <lb/>and its role is not clear. It is present in monocytes, macro-<lb/>phages, and dendritic cells but not in neutrophils (Migeotte <lb/>et al., 2005, 2006). <lb/>The primary role of FPR1 is the activation of chemotaxis <lb/>in response to agonists, and recent studies have shown that <lb/>it also contributes to direct phagocytosis of bacteria by neu-<lb/>trophils (Wen et al., 2019). Moreover, FPR1 and FPR2 have <lb/>been shown to play a dual role in the progression/suppres-<lb/>sion of some types of cancer. For example, FPR1 is impli-<lb/>cated in tumorigenesis and cell proliferation in glioblastoma <lb/>and neuroblastoma (Cussel et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2009; <lb/>Maris, 2010; Snapkov et al., 2016), and FPR2 may pro-<lb/>mote the malignancy of colon cancer (Xiang et al., 2016). <lb/>Conversely, FPR1 and FPR2 have been shown to have tumor <lb/>suppressor properties in gastric cancer (Prevete et al., 2005) <lb/>and melanoma development (Liu et al., 2014), respectively. <lb/>Interestingly, depending on the nature of the ligand, FPR2 <lb/>can have an opposing effect on the inflammatory response, <lb/>as some ligands can induce inflammatory processes to solve <lb/>infection, while other ligands activate pro-resolving and anti-<lb/>inflammatory pathways. Recently, it has been shown that the <lb/>switch between FPR2-mediated pro-and anti-inflammatory <lb/>cell responses is due to a conformational change of the re-<lb/>ceptor following ligand binding: In fact, the binding of anti-<lb/>inflammatory mediators such as annexin A1 (ANXA1) or <lb/>lipoxin A4 (LXA4) results in FPR2 receptor homodimeriza-<lb/>tion and in the release of inflammation-resolving cytokines, <lb/>neutrophil apoptosis, and macrophage efferocytosis (Sodin-<lb/>Semrl et al., 2004). Conversely, inflammatory ligands such <lb/>as serum amyloid A do not cause receptor homodimeriza-<lb/>tion, and their binding with FPR2 induces an increase in <lb/>expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <lb/>(Cooray et al., 2013; Krepel &amp; Wang, 2019). <lb/>Currently, the FPR family represents an interesting phar-<lb/>macological target for the treatment of some pathologies, such <lb/>as inflammatory lung diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury, <lb/>neuroinflammation, and cancer (Bozinovski et al., 2013; <lb/>Burli et al., 2006; Cussel et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2009; <lb/>Liu et al., 2014; Maris, 2010; Perretti et al., 2015; Prevete <lb/>et al., 2005, 2015; Snapkov et al., 2016; Xiang et al., 2016). <lb/>Despite the great numbers of FPR ligands identified over the <lb/>recent years, the pharmacological profile has been character-<lb/>ized in animal model studies for only a few compounds, and <lb/>even less have reached clinical trials. In Figure 1 are reported <lb/>two interesting compounds: Cpd43, synthesized by Amgen <lb/>and exhibiting an excellent profile in animal models of rheu-<lb/>matoid arthritis (Burli et al., 2006; Odobasic et al., 2018), <lb/>and compound Act-389949 which, recently tested in a phase <lb/>I clinical trial, has been found to be safe and well tolerated in <lb/>healthy human subject (Lind et al., 2019; Stalder et al., 2017). <lb/>Our research in the field of FPR ligands led us to identify a <lb/>large number of FPR agonists, including mixed FPR1/FPR2/ <lb/>FPR3 agonists, as well as FPR1-or FPR2-selective agonists <lb/>(Cilibrizzi et al., 2009, 2012, 2013; Crocetti et al., 2013; <lb/>Giovannoni et al., 2013). They are small molecules with dif-<lb/>ferent scaffolds, all displaying a common N-(4-bromophenyl) <lb/>acetamide fragment. The most potent compounds, with <lb/>EC 50 values in nanomolar or submicromolar range, are the <lb/>pyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives EC10 (Vergelli et al., 2016), <lb/>EC3 (Vergelli et al., 2017), and the pyridinone 2a (Crocetti <lb/>et al., 2020; Figure 2). These three compounds were also <lb/>evaluated in vivo in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis and <lb/>were found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity (Crocetti <lb/>et al., 2020). <lb/>In the present study, we investigated further modification <lb/>of these nitrogen heterocyclic scaffolds, in particular five-<lb/>membered pyrazoles (A) and pyrazolones (B) as restricted <lb/>analogues of the previously synthesized pyridazinones <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Structures of FPRs <lb/>agonists <lb/></body>

All reac-<lb/>tions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) <lb/>using commercial plates precoated with Merck silica gel 60 <lb/>F-254. Visualization was performed by UV fluorescence <lb/>(λ max = 254 nm). Chromatographic separations were per-<lb/>formed on a silica gel column by gravity chromatography <lb/>(Kieselgel 40, 0.063-0.200 mm; Merck) or flash chromatog-<lb/>raphy (Kieselgel 40, 0.040-0.063 mm; Merck).

			<body>derivatives 6a,b by treatment with a solution of 2.5N NaOH <lb/>in EtOH and then alkylated with the fragment 2 the <lb/>same conditions as previously described. <lb/>In Scheme 3 is described the synthetic procedure for <lb/>the novel pyrazolones 9a, b, 10, and for 13a-f, which lack <lb/>the 4-Br-phenylacetamide chain at the pyrazolone N-1 po-<lb/>sition. Alkylation of the appropriate pyrazolones 8a and 8b <lb/>(O&apos;Brain &amp; Gates, 1966) with fragment 2 resulted in com-<lb/>pound 9a and the intermediate 9b, which was transformed <lb/>into the final compound 10 through a coupling reaction with <lb/>3-methoxybenzeneboronic acid. For synthesis of derivatives <lb/>of type 13, which present an alkyl chain at N-1 of pyrazolone, <lb/>the starting compound 11 (O&apos;Brain &amp; Gates, 1966) was re-<lb/>acted with the suitable alkyl bromide under standard condi-<lb/>tions, resulting in intermediates 12a-c, which in turn were <lb/>transformed into compounds 13a-f through a cross-coupling <lb/>reaction with appropriate arylboronic acid, palladium(0)-<lb/>tetrakis triphenylphosphine (Tetrakis), and Na 2 CO 3 in anhy-<lb/>drous toluene. <lb/>Finally, when the commercially available pyrazolone 14 <lb/>was reacted with 2 under the same conditions, a mixture of <lb/>the O-alkylated pyrazolone 15 and di-alkylated derivative <lb/>16 was obtained (Scheme 4). Formation of the O-alkylated <lb/>derivative agrees with the numerous possible tautomeric <lb/>forms reported by Katritzky and co-workers for this nucleus <lb/>(Katritzky &amp; Maine, 1964), which can exist as eight different <lb/>tautomers. Among them, the most representative is form C, <lb/>followed by D and E (Arakawa et al., 1974; Figure 3). <lb/>In order to assign the correct structure to compounds <lb/>15 and 16, we performed an extensive nuclear magnetic <lb/>resonance (NMR) study using monodimensional ( 1 H-and <lb/>13 C-NMR) and bidimensional ( 1 H-13 C HSQC and 1 H-13 C <lb/>HMBC) NMR techniques (see Supporting Information <lb/>for the spectra, Figures S1-S8). The first observation was <lb/>that the chemical shift ( 1 H-NMR) of the CH 2 of chain 2 in <lb/>compound 15 (δ = 4.62 ppm) differed from the chemical <lb/>shift value of the same group in the N-alkylated compounds <lb/>of type 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10, all exhibiting a δ value around <lb/>4.80 ppm. These data allowed us to hypothesize that in com-<lb/>pound 15 the alkylation reaction with 2 probably results in <lb/>the O-substituted derivative. This hypothesis is consistent <lb/>with results from the double alkylation product 16 whose <lb/>1 H-NMR spectrum shows two signals at δ = 4.62 ppm and <lb/>δ = 4.72, both compatible with the chemical shifts of O-<lb/>CH 2 and N-CH 2 , respectively. <lb/>Moving to analysis of the 13 C-NMR spectra, we <lb/>found that the chemical shift value of CH 2 from the <lb/>4-Br-phenylacetamide chain in the N-alkylated compounds <lb/>of type 4, 7, and 9 was always around 52-53 ppm. The 13 C-<lb/>NMR analysis indicated that a peak at δ = 67.57 ppm was <lb/>present in compound 15, corresponding to the CH 2 group, <lb/>while the spectrum of compound 16 exhibited two signals <lb/>at δ = 67.62 ppm and at δ = 52.06 ppm. Moreover, for <lb/>compound 15, additional 2D NMR techniques such as het-<lb/>eronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and hetero-<lb/>nuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) were used (see <lb/>Supporting Information). Through HSQC, the correlation <lb/>between the protons and the corresponding carbons was <lb/>assigned (Cα). Using HMBC, which correlates protons <lb/>with carbons in the long range, it was possible to confirm <lb/>that the 4-bromophenylacetamide chain was not bound to <lb/>the N-1, since the correlation between CH 2 of the chain <lb/>and C5 and C5-CH 3 of the pyrazolo nucleus was missing. <lb/>On the contrary, it was not possible to determine whether <lb/>the 4-bromophenylacetamide chain was at the N-2 or at <lb/>the oxygen of the heterocycle. In fact, the alkylation to <lb/>nitrogen at position 2 or to oxygen at position 3 would give <lb/>a similar coupling. In both spectra, it would be possible to <lb/>observe a correlation between CH 2 and CO of the chain <lb/>and CH 2 and C3 of heterocycle. Thus, this result did not <lb/>allow us to distinguish the structure. These data strongly <lb/>suggest a single O-alkylation for compound 15 and a two-<lb/>fold alkylation for compound 16 (N-1 and oxygen), both <lb/>according to the most representative tautomer C shown <lb/>in Figure 3 and to a minor steric hindrance in comparison <lb/>with a double alkylation at N-2 and O. By using single-<lb/>crystal X-ray diffraction, we confirmed our hypothesis, as <lb/>described below. <lb/>S C H E M E 4 Reagents and conditions: (a) K 2 CO 3 , anhydrous <lb/>CH 3 CN, reflux, 2-7 hr <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2 | Solid-state structure from single-<lb/>crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) <lb/>In order to univocally assign the correct structure to com-<lb/>pound 15, crystallographic analysis was performed, and <lb/>the molecular structure of 15 is shown in Figure 4. <lb/>In the asymmetric unit, just one molecule of 15 is present. <lb/>The choice of the correct tautomer of the pyrazole scaffold <lb/>between the two most representative C and D forms (see <lb/>Figure 3) was made on the basis of the position of the hydro-<lb/>gen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom N1, as observed in the <lb/>difference Fourier map. A search of the Cambridge Structural <lb/>Database (CSD, v. 5.41 update 3 August 2020; Groom <lb/>et al., 2016) for molecules containing fragments C and D of <lb/>Figure 3 identified five molecules containing tautomer C and <lb/>two containing tautomer D (only organic compounds were <lb/>considered). Table 1 reports the bond distances involving the <lb/>atoms of the five-membered ring in 15 and those retrieved in <lb/>the CSD. The trend of the bond distances in 15, as compared <lb/>with the values found in the CSD, supports our observations <lb/>reported above using SCXRD, that is, the tautomer of the <lb/>pyrazole scaffold present in 15 is the C tautomer. <lb/>The overall shape of the molecule is definitely planar <lb/>(see Figure 5), with the two rings forming an angle of 3.5 <lb/>(1)°.

			<body>to the interaction with the FPR system or whether a different <lb/>non-specific mechanism can coexist. <lb/>Looking at the biological results, we can observe that only <lb/>a few compounds show some activity, which is in any case <lb/>very modest. <lb/>In particular, among the pyrazoles of types 4 and 7, all <lb/>containing the 4-bromophenylacetamide chain at N-1, and <lb/>the O-alkylated derivative 15 (Table 2), only 4e, 7a, and 15 <lb/>showed moderate FPR agonist activity in the micromolar <lb/>range (4e: EC 50 = 13.2 µM for FPR1, 23.4 µM for FPR2; <lb/>7a: EC 50 = 18.4 µM for FPR1, and 6.1 µM for FPR2; 15: <lb/>EC 50 = 9.8 µM for FPR1 and 25.9 µM for FPR2). Compound <lb/>7a had a threefold preference for FPR2, while 15 displays a <lb/>similar selectivity for FPR1. <lb/>In the pyrazolone series, only compound 9b, bearing the <lb/>4-bromophenylacetamide chain at N-2, showed moderate, but <lb/>selective activity for FPR2 (EC 50 = 23.1 µM; Table 3), while <lb/>among the pyrazolones lacking the 4-bromophenylacetamide <lb/>chain, only compound 13f, the N-2 hexyl derivative, had <lb/>slight non-selective activity (EC 50 = 20.2 µM for FPR1 and <lb/>EC 50 = 10.5 µM for FPR2), Table 3. <lb/>As regard the evaluation on hPMN, with the exception <lb/>of compound 9b which is inactive, all the other compounds <lb/>exhibit a moderate activity in the micromolar range, compa-<lb/>rable with the values reported for the tests on HL-60 cells <lb/>transfected with FPR1 or FPR2, thus indicating that the in-<lb/>crease in intracellular calcium is due to activation of the FPR <lb/>system. <lb/>The low or absent activity of these new compounds sug-<lb/>gests that the pyrazole nucleus was not appropriate for the <lb/>synthesis of FPR agonists. We can further speculate that this <lb/>five-member scaffold could be responsible for a worse ar-<lb/>rangement in the receptor binding site, as the same substitu-<lb/>ents (the 4-bromophenyl acetamide chain or methoxyphenyl <lb/>group) previously inserted into the six-member pyridazinone <lb/>and pyridinone scaffolds resulted in very potent FPR ago-<lb/>nists.

			<body>interactions according to PDS are given in Table S3 reported <lb/>in Supporting Information. <lb/>The non-HB interactions are mostly van der Waals in na-<lb/>ture. The strongest interaction with the participation of Phe102 <lb/>residue can be due to π,π-stacking between the aromatic rings. <lb/>The other strong interaction of fMLF with Arg84 is caused by <lb/>an attraction between charged guanidine and carboxylic moi-<lb/>eties in the peptide and ligand, respectively (Figure 6, panel b). <lb/>The experimentally obtained structure of FPR2 com-<lb/>plexed with WKYMVm (PDB 6OMM; Zhuang et al., 2020) <lb/>contains five protein chains (Figure 7). As shown in Figure 7, <lb/>WKYMVm (stick representation) is complexed with Chain <lb/>R of FPR2 (secondary structure view, Figure 7 panel a; PDB <lb/>6OMM; Zhuang et al., 2020). <lb/>Residues within 3 Å of the peptide are shown in Figure 7 <lb/>panel b, where the peptide forms H-bonds with Arg201, <lb/>Arg205, Asp281, Glu89 (weak), and Asp106 (weak). The <lb/>strongest interaction with the ligand, according to the PDS <lb/>analysis (Table S5 in Supporting Information) corresponds <lb/>to Arg205 of FPR2, as this residue forms three H-bonds <lb/>with different atoms of WKYMVm (Figure 7, panel b). In <lb/>addition, the charged carboxyl groups of Glu89 and Asp281 <lb/>electrostatically interact with the protonated amine group and <lb/>N-H bond of the WKYMVm lysine residue, which leads to <lb/>high PDS values for Glu89 and Asp281 (Table S5). <lb/>According to our docking results, the compounds form <lb/>H-bonds with Asp106 (EC3), Arg201 (EC10, 2a, 4e, 7a, <lb/>10, 15), Arg205 (EC3, 4e, 7a, 10), Gln258 (EC3, 2a, 4e, <lb/>10), or Ser287 (2a) upon their binding with FPR1 (see <lb/>examples in Figure 8 and Figures S11-S16 in Supporting <lb/>Information). <lb/>In particular, EC3 (Vergelli et al., 2017) has H-bond in-<lb/>teractions via the oxygen of the 3-methoxyphenyl group and <lb/>the acetamido carbonyl oxygen with Gln258 and Arg205, <lb/>respectively. The NH of the same acetamido chain interacts <lb/>with Asp106, Figure 8 panel a. Compound 4e, taken as a rep-<lb/>resentative example of the new derivatives, shows a three-<lb/>centered H-bond interaction with Arg201 and Arg205 via the <lb/>oxygen carbonyl of the acetamido chain; the oxygen atom of <lb/>the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety interacts with Gln258, Figure 8 <lb/>panel b. <lb/>In this regard, there were no significant differences in hy-<lb/>drogen bonding patterns between highly potent and moder-<lb/>ately active FPR agonists. Nevertheless, positioning of FPR1 <lb/>agonists containing six-membered and five-membered het-<lb/>erocycles visibly differed (Figure 9, panels a-c). <lb/>The 4-bromophenyl substituents of all investigated <lb/>molecules (EC3, EC10, 2a, Figure 9, panel a; 4e, 7a, 15, <lb/>Figure 9, panel b) in their docking poses are located in <lb/>the same area of space in the vicinity of Leu156, Arg201, <lb/>and Ile204. In addition, the 3-methoxyphenyl groups of <lb/>EC3, EC10, 2a (panel a) and 4e, 7a, 15 (panel b) occupy <lb/>a pocket between Gly209, Trp254, and Gln258. However, <lb/>six-membered pyridazinone and pyridinone moieties of po-<lb/>tent FPR1 agonists EC3, EC10, and 2a occupy a quite dif-<lb/>ferent area of space (close to Tyr257, Ser287, and Phe291) <lb/>than pyrazole heterocycles of moderately active compounds <lb/>4e, 7a, and 15, which could explain their reduced activity. <lb/>In Figure 9 panel c is reported the superimposition of EC3 <lb/>with new compounds 4e and 15 where it is possible to ob-<lb/>serve this situation. <lb/>F I G U R E 1 0 Superimposed docking poses of compounds EC3 <lb/>(violet) and 10 (green skeleton) in FPR1 binding site.

			<body>orientations of ligands with respect to FPR1. In Figure 11, <lb/>FPR1 is shown with a 663 Å 3 cavity that was built by the <lb/>MVD program using a default probe size of 1.2 Å. <lb/>The heterocyclic moieties of potent agonists EC3, <lb/>EC10, and 2a occupy a sub-pocket of the FPR1 binding site <lb/>located between Tyr257 and Phe291, which is not occupied <lb/>by low-active molecules 4e, 7a, and 15. Correspondingly, <lb/>compounds EC3, EC10, and 2a have relatively high PDS <lb/>values with respect to Tyr257 and Phe291 (see Table S4 in <lb/>Supporting Information). Inactive compound 10 also inter-<lb/>acts with Tyr257 and Phe291; however, it has a reverse ori-<lb/>entation in the binding site. It should be noted that p-bromo <lb/>substituted benzene rings of potent and moderately active <lb/>FPR1 agonists occupy a branch of the cavity protruding <lb/>in the vicinity of Arg201 and Arg205. This branch corre-<lb/>sponds to a &quot;hole&quot; in the receptor, which is quite narrow <lb/>and was not included into the cavity with the default probe <lb/>size. A surface of FPR1 is shown together with these poses <lb/>(Figure 12). <lb/>Docking of the compounds into the FPR2 binding site led <lb/>to docking poses in which the molecules were H-bonded to <lb/>Asp106 (2a-weak H-bond, 4e), Arg201 (EC10-weak H-<lb/>bond, 7a), Arg205 (EC10, 7a, 15-weak H-bonds, 4e), and <lb/>Ser288 (10; see examples in Figure 13 and Figure S17-S22 <lb/>in Supporting Information). <lb/>When compound 4e has docked into the FPR2 binding site <lb/>(PDB 6OMM; Zhuang et al., 2020), the H-bonds with Asp106 <lb/>and Arg205 were evident and the 4-bromophenylacetamido <lb/>substituent was oriented toward Leu109 and Phe110, <lb/>Figure 13 panel b. It should be noted that agonist EC3 does <lb/>not form H-bonds with FPR2. However, according to the <lb/>docking scores, compound EC3 has significant attractive van <lb/>der Waals interactions with Arg201, Arg205, His106, and <lb/>Asp106 of FPR2, which are likely to be responsible for FPR <lb/>agonist activity Figure 13 panels a-b. <lb/>The superimposed docking poses of potent and moder-<lb/>ately active agonists onto the FPR2 binding site are shown in <lb/>Figure 14 panel a-c. The highly active agonists EC3, EC10, <lb/>and 2a containing pyridazinone and pyridinone moieties are <lb/>positioned similarly to each other within the binding site: their <lb/>4-bromophenyl and 3-methoxyphenyl fragments are corre-<lb/>spondingly overlaid (Figure 14, panel a). For the pyrazole-<lb/>containing compound 4e, the 4-bromophenyl substituent is <lb/>oriented differently and directed toward Leu109 and Phe110. <lb/>The docking pose of compound 7a is very similar to the poses <lb/>found for agonists EC3, EC10, and 2a (Figure 14, panel b). <lb/>This observation agrees with the relatively high FPR2 ago-<lb/>nist activity of 7a compared with other the pyrazole deriva-<lb/>tives evaluated. While the substituted pyrazole 15 in its best <lb/>docking pose had its 4-bromophenyl moiety nearly overlaid <lb/>with that of potent agonists, the methylpyrazole group of 15 <lb/>protruded toward Leu109 and Phe110 (Figure 14, panels b <lb/>and c). <lb/>As for inactive pyrazolone 10, its docking pose also has an <lb/>altered orientation within the FPR2 binding site (Figure 15) <lb/>with respect to the poses of the potent agonists. <lb/>Regarding FPR2, its binding site is represented by a cavity <lb/>of 628 Å 3 in volume, and the related figures are presented <lb/>similarly to the corresponding FPR1 model.

Based <lb/>on these results, we can say that our assumptions of prob-<lb/>able different arrangements in the FPR1 and FPR2 binding <lb/>site of compounds with a six-membered core like the pyri-<lb/>dazinones/pyridinones versus a five-membered-core like the <lb/>pyrazoles/pyrazolones have been confirmed. In particular, <lb/>comparing binding of compounds EC3, EC10, and 2a (six-<lb/>membered core, high activity) with the new compounds 4e, <lb/>7a, and 15 (moderate/low activity) into the FPR1 binding site, <lb/>it is possible to see that the two fragments essential for activ-<lb/>ity (4-bromophenyl acetamide chain and 3-methoxyphenyl <lb/>group), occupy an area delimited by the same amino acids <lb/>(Leu156, Arg201 and Ile204, and Gly209, Trp254, and <lb/>Gln258). Moreover, the p-bromo substituted benzene rings <lb/>of the potent or moderately active FPR1 agonists occupy a <lb/>branch of the cavity similar to a &quot;hole&quot; in the receptor pro-<lb/>truding into the vicinity of Arg201 and Arg205. The only <lb/>difference between the two types of scaffolds is a worse ar-<lb/>rangement in the binding site of the five-membered ring com-<lb/>pared with the active six-membered scaffolds, which could <lb/>satisfactorily explain the lower FPR1 agonist activity of the <lb/>pyrazoles and pyrazolones studied here. In contrast, inactive <lb/>compound 10 orients the 3-methoxyphenyl group and the <lb/>4-bromophenylacetamide chain oppositely in the binding site <lb/>with respect to the pyridazinone EC3, explaining/justifying its <lb/>complete inactivity. We can conclude that the presence of H-<lb/>bonds is not fundamental for ligand activity in FPR2 and that <lb/>probably other types of interactions could take place. Even in <lb/>this case, the worse arrangement of the five-membered core <lb/>in the binding site compared with the previous series could be <lb/>the main reason for the low activity or inactivity of these new <lb/>pyrazole derivatives. <lb/>5 | SUPPORTING INFORMATION <lb/>The following are available online, NMR spectra of com-<lb/>pounds 4a, 4c, 7a, 7b, 10, 13a, 13d, 13f, 15 (Figures S1-S9); <lb/>selected view of the crystal packing showing molecules of <lb/>15 interacting via hydrogen bonds (Figure S10); selected H-<lb/>bonds in 15 (Table S1) and crystallographic data and refine-<lb/>ment parameters for compound 15 (Table S2); docking poses <lb/>of EC10, 2a, 7a, 10, and 15 in FPR1 and FPR2 binding site <lb/>and superimposed docking poses (Figures S11-S22); analy-<lb/>sis of partial docking scores (PDS) using MolDock scoring <lb/>functions for FPR1 (Tables S3 and S4) and FPR2 (Tables S5 <lb/>and S6). <lb/></body>
