			<body>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the pulmonary disease, tuberculosis (TB), is considered <lb/>to be the world&apos;s most successful pathogen 1 . According to a WHO survey in 2015 2 , Mtb was shown to be respon-<lb/>sible for 10.4 million new cases of TB, which included 480,000 new cases of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB, with <lb/>an estimated 1.8 million deaths and 400,000 deaths resulting from co-infection with HIV. In 2015, the United <lb/>Nations adopted the objective to end the global TB epidemic by 2030 2 . To achieve this goal, there is an urgent <lb/>requirement to develop new diagnostics, vaccines and treatment regimens. <lb/>To limit the potential for resistance, TB therapy has, for decades, used a 4-drug cocktail consisting of isoni-<lb/>azid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide and ethambutol, which inhibit a diverse set of essential metabolic <lb/>nodes 3-6 . Nonetheless, strains with dual resistance to INH and RIF (classed as multi-drug resistant), and more <lb/>extensively against fluoroquinolones and injectable second-line drugs, are on the rise. Clearly, an effective strategy <lb/>to counter resistance has to include not just novel compounds, but perhaps more importantly targets that have not <lb/>yet been subjected to selective pressure by antibiotics. <lb/>In recent years, TB drug discovery has been dominated by whole cell phenotypic high throughput screening <lb/>(HTS) campaigns of extensive compound libraries against Mtb 7, 8 . In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) published a <lb/>collection of 177 non-cytotoxic compounds, known as the &apos;TB box set&apos; , with activity against Mtb H37Rv 7 . This <lb/>set has been extended to include a total of 227 compounds 8 and has led to a broad effort of target assignment. <lb/>However, to progress these hit compounds to leads and clinical candidates, target validation is crucial, enabling <lb/>optimization of chemical scaffolds by medicinal chemistry efforts. Target assignment also offers the potential <lb/>to discover novel drug targets, which can be exploited in inhibitor design. In this work, we have recognized the <lb/></body>

			<body>potential of an exciting novel anti-tubercular drug target, tryptophan synthase, which catalyzes the final step in <lb/>tryptophan biosynthesis. Tryptophan is classified as an essential amino acid in humans and must be acquired <lb/>through the diet. This requirement alleviates the concern of common targets within humans. Here, we describe <lb/>the target identification and hit optimization for compounds 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 1), and have characterized their <lb/>interaction with the target tryptophan synthase. Finally, the target assignment of the tryptophan synthase high-<lb/>lights the plausibility of amino acid biosynthesis pathways as suitable and underexploited Mtb drug targets. <lb/>Results <lb/>Identification of sulfolanes and indoline-5-sulfonamides as anti-TB hits. GSK continuously <lb/>screens the new chemical diversity in its compound collection in search for new hits with anti-tubercular poten-<lb/>tial. As part of these efforts, we have recently identified two new chemical scaffolds with in vitro activity against <lb/>Mtb: sulfolanes, represented by compound 1 and indoline-5-sulfonamides, represented by compounds 2 and <lb/>3 (Fig. 1). The in vitro profile of these compounds is shown in Table 1. All three compounds have good poten-<lb/>cies against Mtb. Importantly, the compounds do not show cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells up to 50-100 µM. <lb/>Lipophilicity is in the desired range (cLogP varies between 1.63 and 2.05) while Property Forecast Index (PFI), <lb/>that has shown a great potential to predict drug developability 9 , is slightly high for compound 3. This fact, together <lb/>with the considerable planarity of the molecule, may explain its poor solubility. The other representative of the <lb/>indoline-5-sulfonamide series (2) exhibits enhanced solubility but low stability in the presence of not only mouse <lb/>but also human microsomal fraction. Disappointingly, medicinal chemistry optimization and structure-activity <lb/>relationship (SAR) explored around the initial hits (compounds 2 and 3) was found to be very limited and after a <lb/>significant number of analogues had been synthesized and evaluated, the series was abandoned. <lb/>The overall profile of the sulfolane 1 is very encouraging. Additional chemical space around the active com-<lb/>pounds in the sulfolane series, allowed further optimization, which is exemplified by compounds 4 and 5. For <lb/>instance, compound 4 presents a reasonable compound with in vitro activity and high metabolic stability, and it <lb/>is therefore suitable for oral in vivo efficacy studies. We also decided to progress compound 5, due to its enhanced <lb/>potency. However, in this case we used a subcutaneous administration to avoid first pass metabolism and mitigate <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>the effect of its low microsomal stability. The structures and in vitro data of compounds 4 and 5 are shown in Fig. 1 <lb/>and Table 1, respectively. <lb/>Figure 2a shows the results obtained when the efficacy of both compounds was measured in an acute infection <lb/>assay in C57BL/6 mice. Compound 4 (oral, 100-500 mg/Kg) proved to be efficacious and a dose/response curve <lb/>was obtained. At the maximum dose evaluated, 350 mg/Kg (the mouse dosed at 500 mg/Kg had to be withdrawn <lb/>due to adverse effects), a reduction of 1.4 log colony forming units (CFU) was observed when compared with <lb/>untreated mice. In the same study and despite its higher in vitro potency, compound 5 did not show a statistically <lb/>significant response. Blood samples were taken from the mice used in the efficacy experiment to quantify the <lb/>concentration of compounds 4 and 5. The data is depicted in Fig. 2b. Although the number of time points was <lb/>limited and accurate pharmacokinetic parameters cannot be calculated, a significant maximum concentration <lb/>and exposure of both compounds was evident. The reason for the lack of efficacy of compound 5 is still unknown. <lb/>A major difference in distribution to the lungs between compounds 4 and 5 is not expected considering their <lb/>structural similarity. The lower half-life of compound 5 could help explain its inactivity in vivo if the minimum <lb/>inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a relevant driver for the efficacy. Further in vivo experiments will be needed to <lb/>test this hypothesis. The anti-tubercular in vivo efficacy observed with compound 4 constitutes a successful hit <lb/>optimization for the sulfolane series and for the value of tryptophan synthase as a therapeutic target. <lb/>Target identification of the sulfolanes and indoline-5-sulfonamides series. Establishing the mode <lb/>of action of inhibitory compounds is an essential step in drug discovery. The identification of biological targets <lb/>is often pursued using a variety of omics-based techniques, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of resistant <lb/>mutants a proven successful starting point 10-12 . Accordingly, this was the preliminary method employed to eluci-<lb/>date the targets of compounds 1, 2 and 3. <lb/>The MICs of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were established in the Mtb model organism, Mycobacterium bovis BCG <lb/>and determined to be 1 μM, 5 μM and 0.7 μM, respectively. Spontaneous resistant mutants were generated at 5× <lb/>and 10× MIC for each compound. The frequency of resistance (FoR) for each compound at 5× and 10× MIC, <lb/>respectively, were as follows: compound 1, 2 × 10 -8 and 1 × 10 -8 ; compound 2, 3 × 10 -8 and 7 × 10 -8 ; compound <lb/>3, 9 × 10 -8 and 2 × 10 -8 . The gDNA from a number of spontaneous resistant mutants generated was extracted <lb/>and subjected to WGS as detailed in Table 2. High frequency, high-quality (statistically relevant) single nucleotide <lb/>polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the mutant gDNA compared to the sequenced wild-type reference <lb/>strain (Genbank accession number NC_008769.1). SNPs located to: ansP2, encoding asparagine permease; trpA, <lb/>α-subunit of tryptophan synthase; trpB, β-subunit of tryptophan synthase. TrpA and TrpB form tryptophan <lb/>synthase, a heterotetramer of α-and β-subunits (with the configuration of αββ&apos;α&apos;). Asparagine permease is an <lb/>asparagine transporter 13 and tryptophan synthase catalyzes the final step in tryptophan biosynthesis. <lb/>Target validation. The results from the WGS indicate that the inhibitors target a process involving amino <lb/>acid transport or metabolism. Therefore, to pursue this line of investigation, the MIC of wild-type (WT) M. <lb/>bovis BCG with compound 1 was evaluated in minimal media (solid) in the presence and absence of 0.01% <lb/>Figure 2.

The mice were treated orally once a day from day 1 to day 8 and sacrificed on day <lb/>9. (b) 4 and 5 were measured in the blood of the infected mice (oral and sc, subcutaneous).

			<body>l-tryptophan, with glycerol as a carbon source. The results are displayed in Fig. 3a. In the absence of l-tryptophan, <lb/>the MIC was &lt;1 μM. However, in the presence of l-tryptophan, the MIC was increased to &gt;8 μM. This indicates <lb/>that l-tryptophan rescues the inhibition by compound 1, where the availability of the amino acid in the media <lb/>alleviates the necessity of l-tryptophan de novo synthesis. The same response was observed with compounds 2 <lb/>and 3; in liquid minimal medium, l-tryptophan rescued the inhibition by the compounds at 1×, 5× and 10× <lb/>MIC as shown in Fig. 3b. In combination with the WGS results, it was highly plausible that compounds 1, 2 and <lb/>3 target tryptophan synthase. <lb/>The enzymes involved in de novo tryptophan biosynthesis are encoded on the trp operon (5′-3′): trpE, Rv1610, <lb/>trpC, trpB, trpA. To confirm that compounds 1, 2 and 3, target biological components of the tryptophan biosyn-<lb/>thesis, and more specifically tryptophan synthase, the MIC of M. bovis BCG strains over-expressing constituents <lb/>of the trp operon in the presence of the inhibitors was evaluated (Fig. 4). The mycobacterial over-expression <lb/>plasmid, pVV16, was used to generate constructs containing the trp operon (trpE-A), trpB, trpB-N185S, trpA <lb/>and trpA-D64E. The mutation trpB-N185S was selected because it was present in a number of sequenced spon-<lb/>taneous resistant mutants (Table 2). For the generation of a mutant TrpA, the mutation D64E was chosen. D64 <lb/>is a conserved residue involved in the communication between the α-and β-subunits, as well as playing a role in <lb/>the opening and closing of the substrate tunnel between the subunits 14 . Over-expression of the individual WT <lb/>subunits did not alter the MIC of the compounds. The over-expression of one subunit would not increase the <lb/>copy number of tryptophan synthase complexes within the cell. With no impact on the MICs, this indicates that <lb/>the inhibitors do not bind into the active site of either subunit and are targeting the whole complex. This coin-<lb/>cides with SNPs observed in both trpA and trpB. It is noteworthy that the individual subunits may not exist in a <lb/>conformation conducive to inhibitor binding, which could change upon complex formation. Nevertheless, the <lb/>MICs were increased with the over-expression of the individual mutant subunits; the tryptophan synthase com-<lb/>plex would exist as mixed mutant and WT copies, and although the total copy number of tryptophan synthase <lb/>complexes would remain the same, the mutation enabled the mutant complexes to function in the presence of <lb/>the compounds. Over-expression of the trp operon also resulted in an increase in the MIC. All components of <lb/>the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway would have been over-expressed, including both subunits of the tryptophan <lb/>synthase. Therefore, the total copy number of tryptophan synthase would have been increased, allowing the cell to <lb/>survive at higher concentrations of inhibitors. These results confirm that tryptophan synthase is the target of the <lb/>anti-tubercular compounds 1, 2 and 3. The involvement of AnsP2 in the resistance phenotype is currently under <lb/>investigation and is yet to be determined. <lb/>Mechanism of inhibition evaluation. Once a target has been confirmed, establishing the mode of inhi-<lb/>bition by a compound is important in its progression through the drug discovery pipeline. Given that the three <lb/>compounds target the tryptophan synthase complex, and not the individual subunits, there are a number of ways <lb/>the compound can exert its effect: preventing complex formation, disrupting the complex after it has formed, <lb/>blocking the conformational changes required for activity, or obstructing the substrate channel between the <lb/>Compound <lb/>Mutant <lb/>× MIC <lb/>Genome position <lb/>of SNP <lb/>Gene <lb/>Base change <lb/>Amino acid <lb/>substitution <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tCg <lb/>W110S <lb/>1817251 <lb/>trpB <lb/>tTt/tGt <lb/>F293C <lb/>2 <lb/>5 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tCg <lb/>W110S <lb/>1816935 <lb/>trpB <lb/>Ttc/Ctc <lb/>F188L <lb/>3 <lb/>10 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tCg <lb/>W110S <lb/>1816935 <lb/>trpB <lb/>Ttc/Ctc <lb/>F188L <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>1816927 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aAt/aGt <lb/>N185S <lb/>2 <lb/>5 <lb/>1816927 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aAt/aGt <lb/>N185S <lb/>3 <lb/>5 <lb/>1816924 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aTc/aGc <lb/>I184S <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>1816924 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aTc/aGc <lb/>I184S <lb/>5 <lb/>5 <lb/>1818011 <lb/>trpA <lb/>Gac/Aac <lb/>D136N <lb/>6 <lb/>10 <lb/>1816996 <lb/>trpB <lb/>cCg/cTg <lb/>P208L <lb/>7 <lb/>10 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tTg <lb/>W110L <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tTg <lb/>W110L <lb/>2 <lb/>5 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tTg <lb/>W110L <lb/>3 <lb/>10 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tCg <lb/>W110S <lb/>4 <lb/>10 <lb/>447564 <lb/>ansP2 <lb/>tGg/tTg <lb/>W110L <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>1816927 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aAt/aGt <lb/>N185S <lb/>6 <lb/>10 <lb/>1816927 <lb/>trpB <lb/>aAt/aGt <lb/>N185S <lb/>7 <lb/>10 <lb/>1816937 <lb/>trpB <lb/>ttC/ttA <lb/>F188L <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>The purified enzymes in different conditions (specifically using the substrates to monitor TrpB activity) were eval-<lb/>uated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by gel filtration <lb/>high-pressure liquid chromatography (GF-HPLC). <lb/>TLC was used to analyze the activity of TrpB and TrpB-F188L in combination with compound 2 (Fig. 5). This <lb/>method enables the production of l-tryptophan to be visualised, confirming TrpB activity. It has been reported <lb/>that TrpB can function in the absence of TrpA, but the presence of the α-subunit enhances activity 15 . We were <lb/>unable to establish TrpB activity in the absence of TrpA (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, both enzymes were <lb/>incubated in equimolar quantities. Figure 5 shows that TrpB actively synthesised l-tryptophan from l-serine and <lb/>indole (lane 8), and that the synthesis was markedly decreased in the presence of inhibitor (lane 9). TrpB-F188L <lb/>was also shown to produce l-tryptophan (lane 11), although comparatively less to the WT enzyme (lane 8). <lb/>However, in the presence of compound 2, TrpB-F188L generated relatively the same amount of tryptophan (lane <lb/>12) compared to when in the absence of inhibitor (lane 11). Although this method of tryptophan production is <lb/>not quantifiable, it is apparent that the mutation imparts a fitness cost, but concurrently alleviates the impact of <lb/>the inhibitor. <lb/>The native PAGE analysis of the tryptophan synthase is shown in Fig. 6. The individual subunits of TrpA, TrpB <lb/>and TrpB-F188L were analyzed individually (lanes 1-3) and in equimolar combinations (TrpA with either TrpB <lb/>or TrpB-F188L) (lane 4 and 8). Discrete bands for each subunit were observed in each case. In the presence of <lb/>the inhibitor (compound 3) (lanes 6 and 10), this result does not change, indicating that the compound cannot <lb/>induce complex formation. In the presence of the TrpB substrates, however, an additional band was observed, <lb/>suggesting the formation of WT and mutant complexes (lanes 5 and 9). Furthermore, additional bands were <lb/>observed in the presence of substrates and inhibitor for the WT complex (lane 7), but not for the mutant (lane 11). <lb/>Tryptophan synthase is a dynamic enzyme, traversing through a number of conformational states in the synthesis <lb/>of l-tryptophan 16 . In the presence of the inhibitor, complex formation appeared to be enhanced. It is possible that <lb/>the inhibitor locks the enzyme in one conformation, preventing structural fluctuations required for activity. These <lb/>results warranted further investigation by GF-HPLC. <lb/>The GF-HPLC results corroborate the observations made from the native PAGE. TrpA and TrpB each eluted as <lb/>a single peak from the gel filtration column, where TrpB exists as a dimer in solution. The subunits were analyzed <lb/>in equimolar concentrations, individually, together and in combination with compound 2 (Fig. 7a). Under these <lb/>conditions, there was no observable peak shift illustrating complex formation. To probe the precise requirements <lb/>of complex formation as observed using native PAGE, the cofactor and substrates were incubated with TrpA and <lb/>TrpB. PLP alone was found to be capable of driving complex formation, as signified by peak shifts: the TrpA peak <lb/>Figure 5. TLC analysis of tryptophan synthase activity and compound 2 inhibition. TrpA and TrpB or TrpB-<lb/>F188L were incubated with substrates and the tryptophan produced was analyzed by TLC. In the presence <lb/>of compound 2, the TrpB activity of the complex was clearly inhibited. However, the TrpB-F188L activity in <lb/>the presence or absence of inhibitor was comparable. The individual reaction components were analyzed as <lb/>controls. The bands representing l-serine and l-tryptophan are shown, and the remaining reaction components <lb/>had no concernable bands in the solvent system and stain used. <lb/></body>

			<body>reduced and the TrpB peak shifted to a higher elution volume, signifying a higher molecular weight and complex <lb/>formation. Interestingly, upon incubation of the enzymes with PLP and compound 2, there was further reduction <lb/>in the TrpA peak and an additional subtle shift to a higher molecular weight of the peak representing the complex. <lb/>There was no peak shift of TrpB when it was incubated with PLP and inhibitor. These results indicate that the <lb/>inhibitor does not block complex formation, nor disrupts the complex once it has formed. Intrinsic tryptophan <lb/>fluorescence binding assays were performed with compounds 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig. S2) indicating binding <lb/>of both inhibitors to the PLP-induced tryptophan synthase complex. <lb/>l-tryptophan production by the WT TrpB and TrpB-F188L was also visualised using GF-HPLC (Fig. 7b). In <lb/>the presence of TrpA, substrates and cofactor, WT TrpB is able to synthesise l-tryptophan. However, with the <lb/>addition of compound 3 (inhibitor does not co-elute with l-tryptophan, unlike compound 2), there was a signif-<lb/>icant decrease in the l-tryptophan produced. The same analyzes were performed using TrpB-F188L. It is clear, <lb/>that even with the inhibitor present, l-tryptophan was produced. To determine whether the F188L mutation pre-<lb/>vents the binding of the inhibitor to the complex, enabling l-tryptophan synthesis, TrpA and TrpB-F188L were <lb/>incubated with PLP (to generate the complex) and compound 3 (Fig. 7c). Surprisingly, the complex peak shifted <lb/>to a lower elution volume as observed with the WT subunits. These results demonstrate that the inhibitor was still <lb/>able to bind to the mutant complex. <lb/>Structural insights into the location of resistance conferring mutations. We attempted to deter-<lb/>mine the structure of Mtb tryptophan synthase complex bound to compound 2 by X-ray crystallography, yielding <lb/>a low resolution (4.0 Å) structure (Fig. 8a). The 4.0 Å X-ray diffraction data set could be phased by molecular <lb/>replacement (MR, see Methods for details). Despite the limited resolution, confidence in the MR solution is jus-<lb/>tified by several criteria: a) high Z-scores (Phaser: Z &gt; 10); b) a complete crystallographic lattice (i.e. all subunits <lb/>make packing interactions with either crystallographic or non-crystallographically related neighbors); c) clearly <lb/>discernible difference in density for the PLP co-factor in all β-subunits plus additional density for the N-terminal <lb/>helix of the TrpA subunit, which was absent in the search model. In total, 6 copies of the α 2 β 2 heterotetrameric <lb/>complex were placed in the orthorhombic unit cell (space group F222), to yield a crystallographic lattice in which <lb/>4 copies of the α 2 β 2 complex form a ring-like structure, and rings assemble to form pseudo-trigonal nodes in the <lb/>3-dimensional lattice (Supplementary Fig. S3). <lb/>We mapped the sites of spontaneous resistance-conferring mutations onto the (partially refined) MR <lb/>solution (Fig. 8). The resistance-conferring mutations cluster at the interface between the α-and β-subunits <lb/>(Fig. 8a). While mutations on the β-subunit dominate, the mutation α:D136N is situated on a surface element <lb/>of the α-subunit that covers the substrate tunnel between the α-and β-subunits (Fig. 8b). This structural evi-<lb/>dence is consistent with the size-exclusion chromatography results, indicating that adding inhibitor to the <lb/>PLP-loaded α 2 β 2 complex further promotes complex formation between the two subunits. Finally, we observe <lb/>a well-defined patch of difference density at contour levels of 2.5 σ in a site surrounded by the resistance muta-<lb/>tions (Supplementary Fig. S3). This density patch is clearly visible in 9 of the 12 α-β interfaces. Shape and extent <lb/>of this density patch are entirely compatible with the molecular structure of the compound 2, and indicate a <lb/>consistent orientation of the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S3). The sulfoxide group faces the hydrophilic α-β <lb/>interface, packing against α:Asp136, one of the resistance sites. The fluorine substituted phenol ring packs against <lb/>a hydrophobic environment, formed by Phe202, Phe211 and the resistance site Pro208. The central indole moiety <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>forms stacking interactions with Phe188, also a resistance site. While the structural detail revealed by a 4 Å map is <lb/>evidently limited, the location of the difference density, its consistent appearance in 9 of 12 β-subunits at contour <lb/>levels distinctly above noise, and the immediate proximity to the sites of resistance-conferring mutations, includ-<lb/>ing α:D136, clearly support the interpretation of this density patch as the inhibitor. Thus, the crystallographic <lb/>evidence in conjunction with the location of resistance conferring mutations strongly suggest that the inhibitor <lb/>binds at the interface between the two subunits and may inhibit diffusion of the indole ring from the active site of <lb/>the α-subunit to that of the β-subunit. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb has made more urgent the need for novel inhibitor <lb/>scaffolds targeting unexploited biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic HTS strategies have driven the identification <lb/>of small molecule inhibitors of Mtb 7, 8 and equally important, inhibitors from these screens are directing the dis-<lb/>covery of novel targets, whilst also renewing the potential of recognized, unexploited ones 10-12, 17-19 . In this work, <lb/>we have identified two new chemical scaffolds with anti-tubercular activities. Through a number of in vivo and in <lb/>vitro experiments, we have confirmed tryptophan synthase as the target of the two structurally distinct inhibitor <lb/>series. <lb/>Tryptophan synthase, composed of a heterotetramer of TrpA and TrpB subunits, catalyzes the final step in <lb/>tryptophan biosynthesis. The α-subunit cleaves indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and glycerophosphate, the <lb/>former diffusing to the active site of the β-subunit where it is covalently bound to l-serine forming l-tryptophan <lb/>in a PLP-dependent oxidation/reduction reaction. We have shown that the tryptophan synthase complex, rather <lb/>than its individual subunits, is the target of compounds 1, 2 and 3. This is supported by evidence from the <lb/>sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants raised against the compounds, which revealed mutations in both <lb/>trpA and trpB. <lb/>Figure 8.

			<body>Assignment of the tryptophan synthase complex as the drug target is also supported by over-expression data <lb/>in M. bovis BCG. Over-expression of the individual WT subunits did not alter the MIC of compounds 1, 2 and <lb/>3. In contrast, in the strains where the tryptophan synthase complex was over-expressed (trpA-E), an increase in <lb/>resistance was observed. Furthermore, there was an increase in resistance of strains that over-expressed mutant <lb/>copies of the individual subunits. Finally, supplementing minimal media with l-tryptophan rescued the growth <lb/>inhibition of M. bovis BCG caused by compounds 1, 2 and 3. Taken together, the resistance, overexpression and <lb/>supplementation data clearly support the notion of the tryptophan synthase complex as the validated target of <lb/>the three compounds. <lb/>Biochemical studies were used to probe the mechanism of action of inhibitors, and establish how the specific <lb/>mutations imparted resistance. First, TLC (Fig. 5) was used to establish TrpB activity (in the presence of TrpA) <lb/>(lane 8). The activity was markedly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor compound 2 (lane 9). Conversely, the <lb/>activity of TrpB-F188L (lane 11) was significantly less than the WT counterpart, but it retained comparable levels <lb/>of activity in the presence of the inhibitor (lane 12). Therefore, the resistance conferring mutation, whilst alleviat-<lb/>ing the impact of the inhibitor, imparts a fitness cost on enzyme activity. In a whole cell setting, the activity of the <lb/>mutant enzyme must be sufficient because it allows cell survival in high concentrations of drug. <lb/>Native PAGE (Fig. 6) and gel filtration (Fig. 7) were used to analyze the effect of the inhibitor on complex <lb/>formation. Native PAGE demonstrated that complex formation occurred in the presence of all substrates (lanes <lb/>5 and 9), and this could not be induced by the inhibitor alone (lanes 6 and 10). These results were corroborated <lb/>by gel filtration. Native PAGE also demonstrated that inhibitor appeared to drive complex formation (lane 7), <lb/>potentially trapping the complex in one conformational state. This was not observed with TrpB-F188L (lane <lb/>11), and led us to investigate further using gel filtration. As anticipated from the native PAGE, the inhibitor was <lb/>shown to drive and not disrupt complex formation of the subunits, and that PLP specifically was a requirement <lb/>for complexation. Surprisingly, this result was emulated by TrpB-F188L. Therefore, the inhibitors were still able <lb/>to bind to the mutant complex, and in the presence of indole and l-serine, l-tryptophan was produced. The α-<lb/>and β-subunits are proposed to switch between catalytically inactive (open) and active (closed) conformations 20 . <lb/>Communication between the two sites enables the activities to be coordinated, preventing the escape of indole <lb/>and enabling this product of the α-subunit to be channeled through a hydrophobic tunnel to the β-subunit. It is <lb/>therefore plausible that whilst the inhibitor is still able to bind to the mutant complex, the F188L mutation allows <lb/>a degree of flexibility, enabling substrate channeling and communication between the subunits. <lb/>Inter-subunit communications of tryptophan synthase subunits are under allosteric control, and mediated <lb/>by a region named the COMM domain 21 . Changes at either active site result in a disruption of interactions with <lb/>the COMM domain, causing molecular movements to transmit the signal 22 . The cooperativity between the sub-<lb/>units ensures that indole is only synthesized at the α-site following the reaction of l-serine at the β-site. The <lb/>well-studied Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase crystal structure reveals a 25 Å hydrophobic tunnel <lb/>connecting the catalytic sites of the α-and β-subunits, which is modulated by a molecular gate formed by the <lb/>residues β-Tyr279 and β-Phe280 21 . The COMM domain controls the opening of the gate to allow the passage <lb/>of indole through the tunnel for reaction at the β-site and l-tryptophan formation. To establish the roles of the <lb/>resistance conferring mutations, we have aligned the Mtb TrpA and TrpB protein sequences (former residue), <lb/>with those of the S. typhimurium TrpA and TrpB (latter residue): α-D136/D130; β-I184/C170; β-N185/N171; <lb/>β-F188/L174; β-P208/P194; β-F293/Y279. These residues locate to the α-β inter-subunit interface, also confirmed <lb/>by the X-ray crystal structure, and are involved in the global motion of the α-subunit relative to the β-subunit, <lb/>particularly residues β-174-179 21 . There are a number of closely interacting inter-and intra-subunit pairs includ-<lb/>ing α-D130-βPro18, α-D56-N171 and β-N171-βY279 14, 21 . The β-N171 residue of the latter pair is involved in the <lb/>reorientation of the β-Y279 gate. β-C170 is located on the wall of the tunnel, where mutations to bulky side chains <lb/>restrict tunnel access and impair α-β subunit communication 22 . It is therefore plausible that the inhibitors bind <lb/>at the interface, blocking substrate channeling or inter-subunit communication. The resistance conferring muta-<lb/>tions could introduce an additional level of flexibility, alleviating any rigidity imposed by the inhibitor, or in the <lb/>case of the β-F293C (equivalent to β-Y279), the mutation to a less bulky side chain might prevent access restric-<lb/>tion of the tunnel caused directly by the inhibitor or through the blocking of the conformational communications. <lb/>Tryptophan biosynthesis represents an attractive drug target. The genes encoding the tryptophan synthase <lb/>subunits are essential, as are the remaining genes in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. In fact, mycobacteria <lb/>have a number of essential genes to synthesise all amino acids de novo. Inhibition of the synthesis of a single or <lb/>multiple amino acids would impose auxotrophism in Mtb, necessitating an external amino acid source for cell <lb/>survival. In the case of tryptophan biosynthesis, the bioavailability of l-tryptophan is limited; in response to <lb/>Mtb infection, macrophages in the granuloma express the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO), metabolizing <lb/>l-tryptophan to l-kynurenine, thus enhancing the impact of inhibitors 23, 24 . Therefore, inhibition of l-tryptophan <lb/>biosynthesis in the setting of IDO activity is an innovative strategy for TB chemotherapy. In this work we have <lb/>validated the therapeutic relevance of tryptophan synthase in vivo: in a mouse model with an incipient immune <lb/>response (IDO activation and tryptophan catabolism are limited), compound 4 was efficacious. Better results are <lb/>expected in clinical environments in which the host response has tryptophan starvation mechanisms fully active. <lb/>Mtb amino acid biosynthesis has been largely unexplored from a drug target perspective. The fundamen-<lb/>tal requirement of amino acids for viability makes the inhibition of these processes suitable targets to pursue. <lb/>Importantly, the clinical use of inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis would have a minimal effect on the normal <lb/>gut flora because it is rich in amino acids that can protect against compound toxicity 25 . Additionally, there is a <lb/>dietary requirement of a number of amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, thre-<lb/>onine, tryptophan and valine. Targeting the biosynthetic pathways against these amino acids, which are likely <lb/>to lack human orthologues, would reduce the toxic potential of inhibitors. These factors further encourage our <lb/>exploration into tryptophan biosynthesis as a target of anti-tubercular compounds. <lb/></body>

Liquid medium: Middlebrook 7H9 <lb/>(Difco), 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80, 10% (v/v) Middlebrook ADC and 0.25% (v/v) glycerol. Solid medium: Middlebrook <lb/>7H11 agar (Difco) with 10% (v/v) Middlebrook OADC and 0.5% (v/v) glycerol. Where applicable, 25 μg/mL kan-<lb/>amycin was added to the media to select for mycobacterial plasmids. The MIC was determined by plating 10 4 , 10 3 , <lb/>10 2 , and 10 1 cells from a mid-log culture of M. bovis BCG on solid medium containing increasing concentrations of <lb/>inhibitor in a dose response. The MIC was the lowest concentration of compound that caused complete inhibition of <lb/>bacterial growth. M. bovis BCG spontaneous resistant mutants were generated on solid media at 5×, 10×, and 20× <lb/>MIC. Resistant isolates were confirmed by first culturing in liquid media (in the absence of compound) before retest-<lb/>ing on solid media containing 5× MIC of each compound.

The <lb/>DNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, 300 cycles). The genome <lb/>sequence of M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 (accession: NC_008769.1) was used as a reference to align reads. <lb/>Generation of plasmid expression constructs. The mycobacterial and Escherichia coli over-expression <lb/>constructs were generated in the plasmids pVV16 and pET28a respectively, both of which encode kanamycin <lb/>selection. For constructs generated in pVV16, the stop codon was not included in the antisense primer, enabling <lb/>the C-terminal vector-encoded histidine tag to be exploited. Conversely, primers designed for the generation of <lb/>pET28a constructs, the stop codon was included, where a vector encoded N-terminal histidine tag is employed. <lb/>Initially, primers were designed to clone trpA, trpB (and the mutant equivalents) and the trp operon (pVV16 <lb/>only) into the multiple cloning sites of pVV16 and pET28a, exploiting the restriction sites NdeI and HindIII. The <lb/>primers are listed in Table 3. Following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions, the genes were amplified by PCR from <lb/>M. bovis BCG (WT or mutant) genomic DNA using Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Following <lb/>purification (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen), the PCR products and the vectors were digested with the <lb/>restriction enzymes specified (FastDigest, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the digest products were purified via gel <lb/>extraction from a 1% agarose gel (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen). Digest products were ligated using T4 <lb/>DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells. The constructs in positive clones <lb/>were verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). <lb/>Electroporation of mycobacterial expression constructs. Electrocompetent M. bovis BCG cells were <lb/>prepared by pelleting and subsequently washing a mid-log culture with decreasing volumes of ice-cold 10% (v/v) <lb/>glycerol. The cells were incubated on ice with 1 μg plasmid DNA, before being transferred to a 0.1 cm electrode <lb/>gap electroporation cuvette. A single pulse of 1.8 kV was applied, and the cells were recovered by incubation over-<lb/>night in liquid media, before positive clones were selected on solid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. <lb/>l-Tryptophan supplementation experiments. The MIC of compound 1 against M. bovis BCG was ana-<lb/>lyzed on solid minimal medium in the presence of 0.01% l-tryptophan. The minimal media (pH7.5) contained <lb/>11 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.8 mM MgSO 4 , 4.6 μM ferric ammonium citrate, 25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 19 mM NH 4 Cl, 0.14 mM CaCl 2 , <lb/>14.5 mM NaCl using 0.1% glycerol as a carbon source and 1.5% agar. The MIC was evaluated as previously described. <lb/>The impact of M. bovis BCG viability in the presence of 1×, 5× and 10× compound 2 or 3 was analyzed in liq-<lb/>uid minimal media with and without 0.01% l-tryptophan. Cells were cultured to OD 600 nm 0.6-0.8 and diluted to <lb/>1 × 10 6 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (OD 600 nm 1.0 = 2.5 × 10 8 CFU/mL) in minimal media with and without <lb/>0.01% (v/v) l-tryptophan. 1 μL compound (100% DMSO) (using stocks of 5 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM compound <lb/>2 or 0.7 mM, 3.5 mM and 7 mM compound 3 (1×, 5× and 10× MIC)) and appropriate controls (1 μL DMSO or <lb/>1 μL 1 mM INH) were aliquoted into a 96-well plate (flat, black bottom, polystyrene) in duplicate. 99 μL 1 × 10 6 <lb/></body>

			<body>CFU/mL ( +/-l-tryptophan) were added to each well and then the plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 7 <lb/>days. 30 μL 0.02% (w/v) resazurin and 12.5 μL 20% (v/v) Tween 80 was added and the plate was incubated in the <lb/>same conditions for 24 h. Fluorescence was measured by λ excitation at 530 nm and λ emission at 590 nm using <lb/>a POLARstar Omega plate reader. <lb/>Expression and purification of recombinant TrpA and TrpB. Recombinant TrpA and TrpB were <lb/>over-expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells from the pET28a constructs. TrpA over-expression was optimised using <lb/>the Studier method of autoinduction 26 . Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 180 rpm, until OD 600 nm 0.2 was reached. <lb/>The temperature was reduced to 20 °C and the cells were cultured overnight before harvesting. Recombinant TrpB <lb/>was over-expressed by 0.5 mM IPTG induction of a mid-log culture grown in terrific broth at 37 °C, 180 rpm. <lb/>Following induction, the cells were cultured overnight at 16 °C before harvesting. <lb/>Recombinant TrpA and TrpB were purified using identical methods. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer <lb/>(50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl and 25 mM imidazole) containing DNAse and Complete pro-<lb/>tease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Cells were sonicated, 30 s on, 30 s off, for 12 cycles. Insoluble material <lb/>was pelleted at 18,000 rpm. The clarified lysate was applied to a 1 mL, pre-equilibrated (in buffer) nickel-charged <lb/>IMAC column. A step gradient of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1000 mM imidazole (in buffer) was used to wash <lb/>the column and elute the recombinant proteins. TrpA eluted at 100 mM imidazole, whereas the cleanest fraction <lb/>of TrpB eluted at 150 mM imidazole. The proteins were immediately buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, <lb/>10% (v/v) glycerol. Anion exchange was performed, where the proteins eluted from a 1 mL Q HP anion exchange <lb/>column over an increasing NaCl gradient. Purified proteins were stored at -20 °C. <lb/>TLC. In order to visualise amino acids by TLC, 5 μg is needed (10 μL loaded). Therefore, each reaction was per-<lb/>formed in 100 μL with substrates (indole and l-serine) and control (l-tryptophan) at 0.5 μg/μL. Each reaction was <lb/>performed in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. TrpA and TrpB/TrpB-F188L were present in equimolar quan-<lb/>tities (10 μM each). PLP was added to 100 μM. Where applicable, compound 2 was added to 100 μM, and replaced <lb/>by an equivalent volume of DMSO. The final DMSO concentration of reactions was 1% (v/v). The reactions were <lb/>incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Once loaded, the TLC (silica gel 60) was developed in butanol:acetic <lb/>acid:H 2 O (12:3:5 (v/v/v)). Ninhydrin was used to detect the amino acids. TLCs were imaged using a Canon EOS <lb/>5D Mark III and processed using Adobe Illustrator 5.0 software. <lb/>Native PAGE. Samples were prepared for native PAGE with the following concentrations in combinations <lb/>as stated (buffer, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl; total volume, 10 μL): 3.6 μM TrpA, 3.6 μM TrpB, 20 μM <lb/>compound 3, 1 mM indole, 1 mM PLP, 100 mM serine. Samples were diluted in an equal volume of sample buffer <lb/>(62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% (w/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and resolved in 25 mM Tris, <lb/>192 mM glycine, using a precast gel (Biorad). Images were taken using a Biorad Gel Doc XR+ with Image Lab <lb/>software, and processed using Adobe Illustrator 5.0 software. <lb/>GF-HPLC. HPLC using a gel filtration column (TSKgel G3000SW XL , 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) was <lb/>used to analyze TrpA and TrpB, measuring absorbance at 210 nm or 280 nm. Samples were prepared in 50 μL with <lb/>the following components (in combinations as stated): 20 μM TrpA, 20 μM TrpB/TrpB-F188L, 100 μM PLP, 100 μM <lb/>indole, 100 μM serine, 100 μM compound 2/3. The reaction buffer was 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Samples <lb/>were incubated at room temperature for 1-2 h (as specified). GF-HPLC was performed on a Thermo Scientific <lb/>Ultimate 3000, and data was recorded on Chromeleon software. Images were generated using GraphPad Prism 5. <lb/>Crystallisation conditions. Purified recombinant TrpA and TrpB were incubated together in equimolar con-<lb/>centrations (8.64 μM) with 86.4 μM PLP, 400 μM indole and 40 mM l-serine in a final volume of 6 mL. After incu-<lb/>bation at room temperature for 1 h, compound 2 was added to 86.4 μM and the reaction was incubated for a further <lb/>1 h before concentrating to 120 μL (equivalent to 10 mg/mL TrpA). Crystallisation conditions were screened using a <lb/>number of sparse matrix screens (Molecular Dimensions) with 300 nL sitting drops (150 nL drops of protein solu-<lb/>tion and screen) dispensed by a liquid handling robot.

			<body>X-ray crystallographic structure determination. X-ray data to 4.0 Å resolution were recorded on beam-<lb/>line I04 at the Diamond Light Source (Supplementary Table S1), using a Pilatus 6 M area detector (DECTRIS). <lb/>The X-ray diffraction images were integrated and scaled using the software XDS, XSCALE 27 , and AIMLESS of <lb/>the CCP4 package 28 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the PHASER software 29, 30 and <lb/>the heterotetrameric TrpAB complex from Pyrococcus furiosus as a search model (pdb entry 5E0K 31 , 33% identity <lb/>for TrpA, 58% for TrpB). The search model was stripped of side chains that are not conserved between the target <lb/>and the P. furiosus structure. Given the large unit cell, the Matthews coefficient analysis did not yield a definitive <lb/>guide to the number copies present in the asymmetric unit. Nevertheless, placing copies of the heterotetrameric <lb/>complex consecutively and selecting the correct solution based on the Z-score (18.5 to 21.3) of the translation <lb/>function allowed to unequivocally determine the position of 6 copies of the αββα complex, leading to a crystal-<lb/>lographically plausible 3D lattice (Supplementary Fig. S3). Later on, coordinates of the refined structure of the <lb/>TrpAB complex of M. tuberculosis became available in the PDB (entry 5TCG, 2.4 Å resolution 32 ). This coordinate <lb/>set was stripped of water molecules and co-factors, mapped onto the molecular solution, and used to correct the <lb/>structural model. The resulting density map consistently showed density for the PLP co-factor, the coordinates of <lb/>which were excluded from the search model. Density was also visible for N-terminal helix of the TrpA subunit, <lb/>which is absent in the P. furiosus ortholog. The additional density, together with the high translation function <lb/>Z-scores, gave confidence that the correct solution had been found. A partial refinement of the molecular replace-<lb/>ment solution led to an R free of 36.9%, refining coordinates, and modelling temperature factors through TLS <lb/>refinement and a uniform B-factor for each protein chain. The difference density map in Supplementary Fig. S3 <lb/>was calculated based on protein coordinates, prior to incorporation of the co-factor or ligands in the model. The <lb/>model of the inhibitor compound 2 was placed manually into the unbiased difference density and adjusted using <lb/>real space refinement 33 , but not included in the crystallographic refinement of the model. <lb/>Mice. Specific Pathogen-free 6-8-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice (18-20 g) were obtained from Envigo <lb/>(Barcelona, Spain). The experiments were performed at AAALAC-accredited GlaxoSmithKline Laboratory Animal <lb/>Science animal facilities in Tres Cantos (Madrid, Spain). The mice were kept in air-filtered isolators with twenty air <lb/>changes per hour. Room temperature and relative humidity were 22 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 10%, respectively. The mice <lb/>were accommodated in groups of up to five individuals in Tecniplast ® type IV cages with autoclaved dust free corn-<lb/>cob bedding (Rettenmaier Iberica, S. L., Barcelona, Spain). The mice were maintained under a 12 h light/dark period. <lb/>Filtered tap water and γ-irradiated pelleted diet from Envigo (Barcelona, Spain) were provided ad libitum. <lb/>In vivo efficacy assessment. The experimental design has been previously described 34 . In brief, mice were <lb/>intratracheally infected with 100,000 CFU/mouse (Mtb H37Rv). Products were administered for 8 consecutive <lb/>days starting one day after infection. Lungs were harvested 24 h after the last administration. All lung lobes were <lb/>aseptically removed 24 h after the last administration, homogenized and frozen. Homogenates were plated in 10% <lb/>OADC-7H11 medium for 14 days at 37 °C. Homogenates from compound treated mice were incubated for 18 <lb/>days at 37 °C in plates supplemented with 0.4% (wt, vol) activated charcoal (Sigma Aldrich) to prevent the effect of <lb/>product carryover. Moxifloxacin (Sequoia Research Products Ltd) was prepared as solution in 20% Captisol(R)/ <lb/>water. <lb/>Blood samples (aliquots of 15 μL) were taken from the infected mice by the lateral tail vein at the following time <lb/>points: compound 4 (oral route): 0.5, 2, 6, 24, 48, 120, 168 and 192 h; compound 5 (subcutaneous route): 0.17, 1, 6, <lb/>24, 48, 120, 168 and 192 h. LC-MS/MS was used as the analytical method for the determination of compound con-<lb/>centration in blood. Plots of blood levels were generated with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc). <lb/>Statistical analysis. Graphic data were prepared with GraphPad Prism software and the results were ana-<lb/>lyzed as stated in the text. <lb/></body>
