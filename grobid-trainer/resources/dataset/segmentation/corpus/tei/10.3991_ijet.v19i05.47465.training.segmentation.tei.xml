Published under CC-BY. <lb/>Online-Journals.org <lb/>PAPER <lb/>Natural Language Processing Approach to Evaluate <lb/>Real-Time Flexibility of Ideas to Support Collaborative <lb/>Creative Process <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a valuable approach to assist in solving <lb/>complex challenges in educational settings. This study explores NLP techniques, particu-<lb/>larly sentence embedding models, to evaluate the flexibility dimension of divergent thinking <lb/>during an open-ended collaborative creative (cocreative) process. The methodology involved <lb/>a case study in which 25 secondary education students participated. The students worked in <lb/>five collaborative groups to solve a real-life challenge through a cocreative process. During <lb/>this study, we focus on evaluating flexibility, defined as the shift from one semantic cate-<lb/>gory to another, grounded in the semantic similarity of ideas. Initially, we measured semantic <lb/>similarity with eight-sentence embedding models and experts. We also conducted a correla-<lb/>tion analysis of the experts and sentence embedding models to choose one highly correlated <lb/>model. Subsequently, we evaluated the flexibility of ideas in creative techniques using experts <lb/>and the high-correlated sentence embedding model. The results disclose that among the <lb/>eight applied sentence embedding models to evaluate the semantic similarity of open-ended <lb/>ideas, the Universal Sentence Encoder Transformer (USE-T) is highly correlated with experts. <lb/>Moreover, USE-T strongly aligns with experts&apos; evaluation to evaluate flexibility. These results <lb/>will be valuable for designing and providing immediate feedback during cocreation, enabling <lb/>AI-driven support to foster innovative solutions to real-world challenges. <lb/>KEYWORDS <lb/>creativity, collaboration, flexibility, divergent thinking, evaluation, automatic, AI, NLP <lb/>1 <lb/></front>

        <body>a classroom setting. The Collaborative Creative (cocreative) processes help students <lb/>to generate creative solutions to real-world challenges by promoting creative think-<lb/>ing, such as Divergent Thinking (DT). DT refers to the ability to find creative poten-<lb/>tial solutions to open-ended problems. Thus, educational researchers have sparked <lb/>interest in exploring ways to enhance DT to promote cocreativity within human <lb/>groups during the cocreative process. This exploration includes evaluating students&apos; <lb/>divergent thinking and providing real-time feedback to boost DT and improve the <lb/>cocreative process. <lb/>Creative potential is often evaluated using DT tests [3]. These tests focus on three <lb/>dimensions of creativity: fluency (number of ideas), originality (unique or unusual <lb/>ideas), and flexibility (number of distinct conceptual categories). Among these dimen-<lb/>sions, flexibility is strongly associated with divergent capacity-making, associating <lb/>thinking with different semantic categories, and possibly producing more originality [4]. <lb/>Creativity research has provided empirical links between individual creative outcomes <lb/>and the flexibility of their thinking [5]. However, flexibility evaluation and its role in <lb/>promoting creativity still need to be explored in comparison with the other dimen-<lb/>sions. Therefore, the present study focuses on the flexibility dimension of creativity. <lb/>Flexibility is conceptualised as the cognitive ability to explore the conceptual cat-<lb/>egories during ideation by moving from one semantic category to another to reach a <lb/>more creative solution [6]. It is one of the key mechanisms of DT&apos;s underlying creative <lb/>process [7], which refers to the key executive function of creative thinking [8]. It is asso-<lb/>ciated with the agility of thoughts, adaptability, and avoidance of cognitive rigidity and <lb/>fixation [9]. It drives individuals to follow diverse directions, dimensions, and path-<lb/>ways [10], which may be more likely to produce highly creative ideas [11]. Therefore, <lb/>exploring and supporting the flexibility of ideas in the cocreative process could help <lb/>students reach their creative potential. In this line of argument, we pursue to automat-<lb/>ically evaluate the flexibility of the cocreative ideas, which could provide feedback <lb/>to the students about their creative performance to achieve high creative goals. To <lb/>achieve the goal of automatically evaluating the flexibility of ideas cocreated in open-<lb/>ended contexts, the question emerges: Which Natural Language Processing (hence-<lb/>forth NLP) techniques are more reliable for automatic evaluation of ideas&apos; flexibility <lb/>dimension of divergent thinking in open-ended learning scenarios? <lb/>Prior studies reported different semantic distance NLP approaches to evaluate <lb/>flexibility automatically [12]. The reason for using semantic distance is twofold. <lb/>Firstly, semantic distances are helpful to model the organisation of knowledge in <lb/>the mind [13]. In particular, if humans associate two concepts more easily, it shows <lb/>that two concepts have a lower distance from each other and vice versa [14] [15]. <lb/>Secondly, semantic distances are a common representation in NLP to measure <lb/>the relatedness of two texts and offer a rich toolbox of distance measures for this <lb/>purpose [16]. To measure semantic distance, two extensively used frameworks are <lb/>semantic networks and semantic embeddings. Semantic networks propose to orga-<lb/>nise the concepts in a graph and that the shortest path distance represents seman-<lb/>tic relatedness [17]. Thus, semantic networks are based on graph theory, consisting <lb/>of nodes representing concepts and links between them signifying relationships. <lb/>In contrast, semantic embeddings assume that concepts are implicitly represented in <lb/>a vector space and that their distance corresponds to their semantic relatedness [15]. <lb/>Based on the previous two frameworks of semantic distance to evaluate flexi-<lb/>bility, different computational techniques are used in the literature. Firstly, seman-<lb/>tic network-based methods [18] using ontologies are used [15] [19] [20]. Ontologies <lb/>represent a language in the structure and hierarchy of millions of words, such <lb/>as Wordnet. However, ontologies have practical implications for open-ended ideas <lb/></body>

        <body>that have limitations, including having a fixed hierarchical structure, limited con-<lb/>textual understanding, difficulty handling polysemy, and struggles with generalisa-<lb/>tion and capturing scientific language in open-ended ideation. Secondly, semantic <lb/>embedding techniques, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [21], are widely used. <lb/>LSA limitations include struggles with polysemy and a need for explicit semantic <lb/>context modelling. Later, word embedding models Word2Vec [22] and especially <lb/>Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) are currently superior to other <lb/>techniques that have been previously developed [23] [24]. However, word embed-<lb/>ding models cannot differentiate between a list of keywords and a sentence, which <lb/>can lose meaningful information about the context and semantic meaning among <lb/>constituents of sentences. Therefore, next, we explore the recent advancement of <lb/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, which has provided opportunities for creativ-<lb/>ity evaluation research. <lb/>AI techniques, particularly pre-trained sentence embedding models, have the <lb/>potential to evaluate the flexibility of open-ended ideas generated for the follow-<lb/>ing three reasons: Firstly, the ideas generated in the open-ended cocreation are few <lb/>and open-ended (no pre-existing domain-specific data is available); thus, sentence <lb/>embedding is pre-trained over a large corpus of data, and then the learned knowl-<lb/>edge is transferred to other downstream NLP tasks. Secondly, ideas are presented <lb/>in a sentence structure (more complex than single-word ideas). Hence, sentence <lb/>embedding models encode the whole sentences in the vector space, keeping the <lb/>semantic and contextual meaning of words as constituents of the sentences. Thirdly, <lb/>the nature of the task evaluates flexibility as category switching from one semantic <lb/>concept to another based on semantic distance. The sentence embedding models <lb/>tackle the limitations of previously used NLP techniques for measuring the seman-<lb/>tic distance between textual ideas [25]. Despite their potential, there is a significant <lb/>research gap, as sentence embedding models have not been extensively tested to <lb/>evaluate the flexibility of ideas in PBL environments, particularly in cocreative con-<lb/>texts. Therefore, this paper expands this exploration by using sentence embedding <lb/>models to evaluate the flexibility of the co-generated ideas during the complex cocre-<lb/>ative process to find answers to the following research question: How could deep <lb/>learning sentence embedding models evaluate the flexibility of ideas generated in a <lb/>complex, open-ended, and cocreative ideation process? <lb/>Automatic flexibility evaluation in an open-ended cocreative process has <lb/>wide-ranging pedagogical impacts by facilitating teachers to design and deliver real-<lb/>time flexibility feedback in a classroom environment. Real-time flexibility feedback <lb/>can promote cognitive adaptability, flexible mindsets, and the avoidance of rigidity <lb/>in thinking [8] because moving to a different category might counteract getting stuck, <lb/>which makes room for new ideas [26]. Moreover, it encourages diversity in topics, <lb/>fosters the generation of novel ideas, and enhances problem-solving and cocreative <lb/>skills among students. Integrating real-time flexibility evaluation and feedback can <lb/>enhance teaching and learning through the cocreative processes within the school <lb/>environment [27]. <lb/>2 <lb/>METHOD <lb/>2.1 Participants <lb/>This study involved 25 students from an urban secondary school in Lleida, <lb/>Spain. The participants were organised into five small groups, each comprising <lb/>five students. The teacher randomly assigned the groups to solve an open-ended <lb/></body>

        <body>scientific challenge related to identifying the causes of pollution in the Segre River in <lb/>Lleida, Spain. Among the participants, 60% were female and 40% were male, with <lb/>an average age of 15 to 16 years. The research received ethical approval from the <lb/>University&apos;s ethical committee. <lb/>2.2 Research context <lb/>This study adopts a case-study research design using a quantitative approach <lb/>[28] to solve an open-ended scientific challenge about river&apos;s pollution in Lleida, <lb/>Spain. Students work collaboratively for 18 hours to solve the challenge through <lb/>technology-supported cocreative processes using the Viacocrea application [29]. <lb/>The Viacocrea application is a prototype that offers a multi-user collaborative <lb/>platform. Viacocrea designs the cocreative process by providing a graphical rep-<lb/>resentation of the cocreative techniques, structuring the creative phases, and orches-<lb/>trating small group cocreative problem-solving endeavours. In this study, students <lb/>solved 13 creative techniques of the Viacocrea repertoire organised in six phases: <lb/>1) Starting up (creating a group and gaining inspiration from various resources); <lb/>2) Defining (defining and understanding the problem); 3) Designing (designing an <lb/>action plan to solve the problem); 4) Building up (building up new knowledge, its <lb/>organisation, and analysis); 5) Summing Up (highlighting the relevant solutions); <lb/>6) Communicating (sharing their creative solutions with others). Following the <lb/>six phases of the cocreative process, students worked within a shared multi-user <lb/>collaborative digital space in which all the small-group students were engaged in <lb/>face-to-face and technology-based interactions. All small-group members can anno-<lb/>tate in Viacocrea space and collaborate with group members within the group; how-<lb/>ever, there were no inter-group interactions. <lb/>In this paper, for evaluation of flexibility of ideas, researchers agreed and selected <lb/>two creative techniques, such as the Learning Chain (Build Up phase) and Telescope <lb/>(Sum Up phase), illustrated in Figure 1. The Learning Chain technique aims to go <lb/>deeper into a topic by thinking about different key questions and answering them <lb/>from different perspectives, as shown in Figure 1 (Left). Also, the Telescope technique <lb/>aims to propose different ideas and then narrow them down to the most relevant <lb/>ones in Figure 1 (Right). <lb/>Fig. 1.

        <body>2.3 Study procedure <lb/>In this section, firstly, we provide insights into the collection and preparation of our <lb/>dataset, which originates from the creative techniques employed during the cocre-<lb/>ative process. Secondly, we compute ideas&apos; semantic similarity using eight-sentence <lb/>embedding models and expert evaluations. This semantic similarity computation <lb/>is the basis for the subsequent flexibility evaluation. We perform this step because <lb/>flexibility evaluations are based on semantic similarity. Subsequently, we identify a <lb/>sentence embedding model that correlates highly with experts&apos; scores. Thirdly, we <lb/>conduct a flexibility evaluation of the cocreative ideas using the highly correlated <lb/>model and experts&apos; scores. Lastly, the data analysis methodology employed in this <lb/>study is presented. <lb/>Dataset collection and preparation. As described in Research Context 2.2, <lb/>students shared their cocreative ideas using creative techniques. We collected data <lb/>in small groups using two creative techniques: Learning Chain and Telescope in the <lb/>Building Up and Sum Up phases, respectively. For the Learning Chain technique, we <lb/>focused on the ideas generated in the three sections: subject, question asked, and <lb/>conclusion, highlighted in Figure 1 Left). In the subject section, eight ideas were <lb/>introduced, resulting in 36 similarity comparisons after comparing each idea with <lb/>the remaining seven ideas, excluding duplicates. In the questions asked section, par-<lb/>ticipants shared 20 ideas, yielding 210 similarity comparisons from comparing each <lb/>idea with the other 19, excluding duplicates. In the conclusion section, 11 ideas were <lb/>shared, resulting in 66 similarity comparisons from comparing each idea with the <lb/>other 10. Overall, the Learning Chain technique produced similarity comparisons of <lb/>a total of 282 (36 + 210 + 66 = 282). For the Telescope technique, participants shared <lb/>23 ideas, so by comparing each idea with the rest of the 22 ones, excluding the dupli-<lb/>cates, leads to 276 comparisons of ideas. Combining both techniques, we obtained <lb/>588 (282 + 276 = 588) ideas. This dataset is used for computing the semantic similar-<lb/>ity of ideas by experts and sentence embedding models, described in Section 2.3.2. <lb/>For flexibility evaluation, we created response pairs from the list of responses <lb/>of each collaborative group to assess the flexibility of thinking. Similar to previous <lb/>studies [6, 30], we paired the ideas based on the design of the two creative tech-<lb/>niques, Learning Chain and Telescope. For example, each group shared four ideas in <lb/>the question-asked section of the Learning Chain. So, within the group, we compare <lb/>the first idea with the second, the second with the third, and so on. Also, each group <lb/>shared at least two ideas in the selected section of the Telescope, so we compared the <lb/>similarity between the consecutive ideas. Flexibility evaluation is further described <lb/>in Section 2.3.3. <lb/>**Text similarity with experts and sentence embedding models. Flexibility <lb/>evaluation depends on the semantic distance between the ideas. Therefore, first, we <lb/>need to compute the semantic similarity of ideas with expert scores and sentence <lb/>embedding models. This evaluation determines which sentence embedding model <lb/>highly correlates with experts&apos; scores. Therefore, we accomplished this through the <lb/>following two actions. <lb/>Firstly, in the experts&apos; flexibility evaluation, three experts evaluated the ideas <lb/>based on semantic similarity by following two key criteria: 1) the general mean-<lb/>ing of the ideas and 2) the use of key concepts, key topics, and details of the ideas <lb/>(details can change the meaning). Experts rate each idea according to a similarity <lb/>scale from 0 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar). The three experts indi-<lb/>vidually score each idea based on semantic similarity with other ideas. After individ-<lb/>ual scoring, the three experts revised the ideas and discussed their scores to achieve <lb/></body>

        <body>agreed-upon expert scores. The agreed expert scores will be used to compare cor-<lb/>relation with sentence embedding models. <lb/>Secondly, we employ eight off-the-shelf, widely used sentence embedding models <lb/>to test which model correlates highly with experts&apos; evaluation in automatic evalu-<lb/>ation, which include: a) The Language Model (ELMo) [31] has been selected, which <lb/>has a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture trained on the <lb/>one billion word benchmark; b) Two InferSentence embedding models [32], namely, <lb/>InferSent with GloVe [33] and InferSent with FastText [34], have the architecture <lb/>of Bi-directional LSTM with softmax trained on the Stanford Natural Language <lb/>Inference (SNLI) dataset [35]; c) two unsupervised general-purpose universal sen-<lb/>tence encoders [36], namely, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Transformer and <lb/>USE Deep Averaging Network (DAN), trained on large corpora of Wikipedia, SNLI, <lb/>web news, and web questions and answers, are used; and d) three Sentence-BERT <lb/>were taken into account, namely, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 [37], all-mpnet-base-v2 [38], and <lb/>SRoBERTa-large [39], that are fine-tuned on NLI [40]. <lb/>From the eight embedding models above, the one with the highest correlation <lb/>with experts&apos; scores will be used for flexibility evaluation. <lb/>Flexibility evaluation. Flexibility evaluation involves counting the number <lb/>of switches from one concept to another between two successive ideas generated <lb/>during the cocreative process. Therefore, in this study, we measure the semantic <lb/>similarity of ideas from 0 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar) in the <lb/>Learning Chain and Telescope creative techniques. Semantic similarity identifies <lb/>any change in a category switch (dissimilar or closer to dissimilar means the ideas <lb/>are related to different concepts) or if there is a category stay (e.g., similar or close <lb/>to similar means the ideas are related to the same concept). A similarity threshold <lb/>of 0.5 is applied because it shows the 50% probability of category stay or category <lb/>switch if the semantic similarity scores span from 0 to 1(0, 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7, <lb/>0.8,0.9,1.0). <lb/>A similar methodology has also been applied in other studies related to creativ-<lb/>ity [6]. If values lie between to 0 and 0.5 or equal to 0.5 (closer to 0 means related <lb/>to a different category), there is a category switch, and if the value lies between <lb/>0.5 and 1 (closer to 1 means related to a similar category), there is a category stay. <lb/>Each idea was coded for category switch (1) and category stay (0) [9], and finally, the <lb/>number of switches as a flexibility score. <lb/>Data Analysis. We performed the following two analyses. Firstly, we adopted <lb/>Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis to measure the correlation between <lb/>experts and automatic scores to examine which sentence embedding model highly <lb/>correlates with experts&apos; scores. Secondly, we use descriptive statistics to compare <lb/>the flexibility score of experts and the model, which is highly correlated with <lb/>experts&apos; scores. <lb/>3 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Flexibility evaluation relies on semantic concept similarity to assess category <lb/>shifts or continuations across two consecutive responses. The flexibility evaluation <lb/>involved a two-step approach with two results. Initially, we employed eight sentence <lb/>embedding models alongside expert ratings to evaluate semantic similarity among <lb/>ideas extracted from the two creative techniques. The correlation analysis between <lb/>the embedding models and experts&apos; scores to identify the most correlated model for <lb/>flexibility computation is presented in Section 3.1. Subsequently, Section 3.2 presents <lb/></body>

        <body>the flexibility evaluation scores of ideas generated during the Learning Chain and <lb/>Telescope creative techniques. <lb/>3.1 Comparing automatic scores from sentence embedding models <lb/>with experts&apos; scores <lb/>In the automatic evaluation of flexibility, firstly, we tested eight sentence embed-<lb/>ding models to select which embedding model correlates highly with the experts&apos; <lb/>score on the dataset used in this study. So, referring to the correlation between <lb/>the sentence embedding models and experts&apos; scores, the results are illustrated in <lb/>Table 1. Our results revealed that the USE-T model displayed a substantial correla-<lb/>tion with the expert scores (r = .860, Spearman = .784), followed by USE DAN (r = .827, <lb/>and Spearman = .728), all-MiniLM (r = .839, and Spearman = .753), and all-mpnet <lb/>(r = .804, and Spearman = .713). The results show that USE-T can be used for flex-<lb/>ibility evaluation, a highly correlated model among the eight-sentence embedding <lb/>models. This result aligns with those of another study that found that USE-T highly <lb/>correlates with experts&apos; score-based semantic similarity criteria [41]. <lb/>Table 1.

Next, we present the flexibility <lb/>scores based on semantic similarity using USE-T and expert evaluations. <lb/>3.2 Flexibility evaluation <lb/>We performed a flexibility evaluation using expert evaluation and USE-T, a model <lb/>that strongly correlates with expert evaluations.

Firstly, and in contrast to existing manual approaches in creativitiy assess-<lb/>ment, this approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with subjective <lb/>creativity evaluation of open-ended ideation, such as concerns regarding reliability <lb/>(e.g., different experts can have different opinions and scoring), cost (needs several <lb/>experts to do manual evaluation), and time constraints [42] [43] [44]. <lb/>By contrast, sentence embedding models provide consistent and objective scor-<lb/>ing, reduce resource expenditure without involving human resources, and auto-<lb/>matically produce quick evaluations. These capabilities enable sentence embedding <lb/>models to be integrated into technology-supported environments to evaluate <lb/>and provide timely feedback on students&apos; creativity performance. Secondly, our <lb/>approach outperforms previous research in automatic creativity evaluation, which <lb/>has already explored various techniques, including statistical methods (such as LSA), <lb/>knowledge-based similarity (ontology-based approaches), and deep learning meth-<lb/>ods such as GloVe and other word embedding models. These computational tech-<lb/>niques exhibit limitations, e.g., LSA is a counting-based method, knowledge-based <lb/>presents ideas in a graph structure, and word embedding models are based on word <lb/>embedding. Therefore, when ideas are generated in sentence structure, these tech-<lb/>niques consider those lists of keywords and lose the semantic and contextual meaning <lb/>among the words that constitute a meaningful sentence. Therefore, our study shows <lb/>that sentence embedding outperforms the previously existing techniques, which are <lb/>able to vectorise the whole idea (sentence) into numerical vector space, keeping the <lb/>semantic and contextual meaning of words&apos; constituents in the sentences. In sum, <lb/>this capability addresses the shortcomings of previous techniques used in creativity <lb/>research and sets a new standard in evaluating creativity in educational settings. <lb/>Transitioning into the specific learning context of open-ended cocreation devel-<lb/>oped in our study, we discuss three arguments underscoring that sentence embed-<lb/>ding models emerge as highly effective solutions for addressing flexibility evaluation <lb/>challenges. Firstly, the cocreative ideas are expressed in sentence structures and sen-<lb/>tence embedding models are specialised to effectively encode the entire sentence <lb/>while preserving its syntactic and semantic meanings [45]. This capability ensures <lb/></body>

        <body>a comprehensive representation of the ideas, making the models well-suited for <lb/>assessing sentence-level creativity. Secondly, the limited availability of datasets in <lb/>cocreative scenarios is efficiently handled by the unsupervised nature of sentence <lb/>embedding models, which excel in zero-shot tasks, allowing them to generalise to <lb/>new and unseen data without extensive training [46]. This adaptability enables <lb/>accurate evaluations even with small datasets. Lastly, as flexibility evaluation <lb/>relies on semantic similarity tasks, sentence embedding models outperform earlier <lb/>approaches for text similarity computation [47]. In conclusion, these effective solu-<lb/>tions through sentence embedding models further solidify their role as a robust tool <lb/>in evaluating open-ended cocreation within educational settings. <lb/>Furthermore, our study reveals that four sentence embedding models exhibit <lb/>high correlations with expert evaluations Specifically, the USE and SBERT mod-<lb/>els, such as USE-T, USE-DAN, all-MiniLM, and all-mpnet, stand out in performance <lb/>(see Table 1). In our view, several factors could contribute to these promising high <lb/>correlation results with experts&apos; scores. Firstly, these models are trained using a <lb/>combination of unsupervised training on unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning on <lb/>supervised datasets like the SNLI dataset. The inclusion of SNLI training is crucial <lb/>for obtaining higher-quality sentences. Secondly, the nature of the datasets used <lb/>for training these four models proves advantageous for our context. These models <lb/>are trained on vast and diverse data sources, including Wikipedia, SNLI, web news, <lb/>web questions, and the answers book corpus, which align well with our dataset. <lb/>Lastly, the variation in results can be attributed to the different abilities and archi-<lb/>tectures of the pre-trained embedding models [48], essential for learning contex-<lb/>tual representations of words and the semantic vectorisation of whole sentences. <lb/>Architectures like transformers, deep averaging networks, and finSoftmax BERT on <lb/>SNLI with Softmax have demonstrated superior performance in our evaluations. <lb/>In conclusion, among these four models, we selected the USE-T to compute the flexi-<lb/>bility further because it is most highly correlated with experts&apos; scores on computing <lb/>the semantic similarity of ideas. <lb/>Finally, our research reveals that the USE-T model consistently produced flexibil-<lb/>ity scores that closely matched expert evaluations in Table 2. However, there was a <lb/>difference in flexibility scores on only one score. For example, experts calculated two <lb/>categories while USE-T computed three, which can be observed in Group 4 of the <lb/>Learning Chain technique in Table 2. This minute variation occurs with ideas hav-<lb/>ing scores closer to 0.5, whereas ideas with similarity scores significantly different <lb/>from 0.5 exhibit clear distinctions in similarity or dissimilarity. We argue that this <lb/>variability in the results is not dependent on the choice of the similarity threshold <lb/>(0.5). Even if we were to select a different threshold, we might still encounter similar <lb/>minute variations in the scores. In conclusion, the high validity of USE-T&apos;s scores, <lb/>and similar to the experts&apos; scores, demonstrates that USE-T can effectively assess <lb/>the flexibility of open-ended ideas in a real classroom setting, facilitating the cocre-<lb/>ation process. <lb/>To sum up, our study has provided experimental evidence regarding using sen-<lb/>tence embedding models, especially USE-T, to evaluate the flexibility of open-ended <lb/>ideas generated during the cocreative process. The study contributes to ecological <lb/>and pedagogical value in learning and teaching environments. This AI technique <lb/>could be integrated into the Viacocrea technology-supported creative process and in <lb/>other digitalised educational settings to provide feedback to teachers and particularly <lb/>to a group of students. Flexibility feedback could suggest new categories to avoid fix-<lb/>ating on one category, which could help improve divergent thinking. Moreover, real-<lb/>time flexibility feedback during the cocreative process would facilitate, orchestrate, <lb/></body>

        <body>and regulate students&apos; cocreation actions, which would grow into fruitful group cre-<lb/>ative-thinking mechanisms [49]. <lb/>5 <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>This paper aims to automatically evaluate the flexibility of open-ended ideas <lb/>generated while solving a real-life challenge. To meet this objective, we explore our <lb/>research question: &quot;How could deep learning sentence embedding models evaluate <lb/>the flexibility of ideas generated in the context of a complex, open-ended, and cocre-<lb/>ative ideation process?&quot;. To answer the research question, this study made mainly <lb/>the following two contributions. <lb/>Firstly, we proposed using sentence embedding models for flexibility evaluation <lb/>as a semantic category switch between consecutive ideas. The use of sentence embed-<lb/>ding models tackles the computational challenges faced by previously developed <lb/>techniques (e.g., semantic networks, LSA, word embedding models) for automati-<lb/>cally evaluating the flexibility of open-ended ideas. Furthermore, our study revealed <lb/>that sentence embedding models effectively evaluate the flexibility of open-ended <lb/>ideas generated during the cocreative process in the real classroom context. <lb/>Secondly, we conducted a case study to validate the reliability of the sentence <lb/>embedding models to evaluate the flexibility of open-ended ideas. Our results dis-<lb/>closed that among the eight applied sentence embedding models considered, four <lb/>models, namely, USE-T, USE-DAN, all-MiniLM, and all-mpnet, produced highly cor-<lb/>related results with experts&apos; scores on evaluating the semantic similarity of ideas. <lb/>Furthermore, we used the highly correlated model USE-T and experts&apos; scoring to eval-<lb/>uate the flexibility of ideas during the cocreative process. We found that USE-T yielded <lb/>significantly similar results to the experts&apos; scores when evaluating flexibility based on <lb/>the number of category switches during cocreation. These contributions are based <lb/>on psychometric evidence that provides scalable, valid, replicable, and cost-effective <lb/>tools for evaluating the flexibility of open-ended ideas during the cocreative process. <lb/>Our study contributions hold significant ecological, pedagogical and practical <lb/>implications in real classroom settings. The design of technology capable to sup-<lb/>port cocreative problem solving is becoming increasingly prevalent in educational <lb/>settings. Our study makes strides towards AI-supported orchestration of cocreation <lb/>processes by examining the possibilities that sentence embedding models offer to <lb/>evaluate the flexibility of ideas cogenerated during the process of solving a complex <lb/>and open-ended challenge. This contribution also situates its application in other <lb/>educational technologies and e-learning platforms by incorporating creativity and <lb/>AI into teaching and learning environments. Simultaneously, our study could be <lb/>integrated into these platforms to facilitate AI assistance in real-time flexibility feed-<lb/>back on students&apos; solutions to assist them to generate diverse solutions and improve <lb/>their divergent thinking. These contributions aim to equip individuals with the com-<lb/>petencies to generate creative solutions for complex economic, environmental, and <lb/>social challenges, leading towards a more innovative and sustainable future. <lb/>5.1 Limitations and future work <lb/>In our view, our research exhibits certain limitations that offer opportunities for <lb/>future enhancements. In creativity research, flexibility can be evaluated through <lb/>two primary approaches: one involves category switching, which signifies a shift <lb/></body>

        <body>from one semantic idea to another, while the other entails the identification of <lb/>semantic categories or topics. Our study specifically focused on evaluating flexibility <lb/>through the lens of category switching. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that flex-<lb/>ibility can also be assessed by identifying semantic categories or topics within a <lb/>broader and more open-ended cocreative process. However, this approach necessi-<lb/>tates to predefine or limit the number of categories. Therefore, it can constrain the <lb/>emergence of new categories, as students&apos; thoughts are compartmentalised within <lb/>predetermined categories, hindering the natural evolution of innovative categories. <lb/>Furthermore, our study employed eight widely used pre-trained sentence embed-<lb/>ding models with a relatively limited dataset. However, it is important to note that, in <lb/>this particular case study, we used pre-trained models and did not involve model train-<lb/>ing to learn from the large data. Nevertheless, the dataset, generated within a real-world <lb/>context, retains its value in reaching our research objectives by successfully evaluating <lb/>the flexibility of ideas generated in the cocreative techniques. This research aims to <lb/>enhance the synergies between AI and creativity support to facilitate the development <lb/>of effective teaching and learning methodologies within the cocreation context. <lb/></body>
