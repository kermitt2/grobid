			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>The concept of spin waves as dynamic eigenmodes of a magnetically ordered medium was introduced <lb/>by Bloch 80 years ago 1 . From a classical point of view, a spin wave represents a phase-coherent precession <lb/>of microscopic vectors of magnetisation of the magnetic medium 2,3 . Holstein and Primakoff 4 and Dyson 5 <lb/>introduced quanta of spin waves called magnons. They have predicted that magnons should behave as <lb/>weakly interacting quasiparticles obeying the Bose-Einstein statistics. Therefore, term magnonics should in <lb/>principle describe a subfield of magnetism connected with quantum magnetic dynamic phenomena. <lb/>However, in a similar way as electronics addresses a broad variety of effects that are not limited by a <lb/>quantized structure of the electrical current (e.g. single electron devices, shot noise etc.), it is now a broad <lb/>consensus to use the term magnonics to cover a broad field of magnetism connected with spin waves in <lb/>general. <lb/>Early experimental evidence for the existence of spin waves came from measurements of <lb/>thermodynamic properties of ferromagnets, in particular the temperature dependence of their saturation <lb/>magnetization M 0 . The famous T 3/2 Bloch law is an indirect confirmation of the existence of spin waves in <lb/>nature 6 . The first direct observation of spin waves was made using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) by <lb/>Griffiths for the case of uniform precession 7 , which can be viewed as a spin wave with a wave vector k=0. <lb/>Later, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) experiments performed by Fleury et al confirmed the existence of spin <lb/>waves with non-zero wave vectors 8 . In many aspects, a spin wave can be considered as a magnetic analogue <lb/>of a sound or light wave. Several decades of experimental and theoretical research have demonstrated that <lb/>spin waves exhibit most of the properties inherent to waves of other origins. In particular, the excitation and <lb/>propagation 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 , <lb/>reflection <lb/>and <lb/>refraction 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 , <lb/>interference <lb/>and <lb/>diffraction 28,29,30,31,32,33 , focusing and self-focusing 34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 , tunnelling 44,45 of spin waves and <lb/>Doppler effect 46,47,48 as well as formation of spin-wave envelope solitons 49,50,51,52 were observed. Spin-wave <lb/>quantization due to finite size effect was discovered very early in thin films 53,54 . Recently it was observed <lb/>and extensively studied in laterally confined magnetic structures 55,56,57,58,59,60,61 . The macroscopic quantum <lb/>phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons was demonstrated in a few different <lb/>magnetic systems 62,63,64 . In yttrium-iron-garnets (YIG) BEC of magnons was observed at room temperature. <lb/>As it will be discussed later, this effect might be used to generate microwave signals by conversion of the <lb/>energy of incoherent broadband electromagnetic radiation into monochromatic spin waves or <lb/>electromagnetic radiation. In spintronics, spin waves are considered as a mechanism responsible for phase <lb/>locking of arrays of spin transfer torque oscillators 65,66,67,68,69,70 and for rectification of microwave currents <lb/>passed through ferromagnetic microwave guides 71,72,73 . <lb/>Such broad variety of observations have stimulated the field of magnonics 74,75,76,77 . Similar to <lb/>spintronics 78,79 , the main application direction of magnonics is connected with the ability of spin waves to <lb/>carry and process information on the nanoscale. Here, research is in particular challenging since spin waves <lb/>exhibit several peculiar characteristics that make them different from sound and light waves. The dependence <lb/>(k) for spin waves is highly dispersive and usually contains a gap  0 =(k=0) that depends on the strength <lb/>and orientation of the applied magnetic field as well as on the size of the ferromagnetic sample. Also, the <lb/>(k)-law is anisotropic even in case of an isotropic magnetic medium. In addition, spin waves are governed <lb/>by different interactions dominating on different length scales, e.g. by the exchange and dipolar interactions <lb/>dominating on nanoscopic and microscopic length scales, respectively. These characteristics have turned out <lb/>to be decisive to understand spin waves propagating in micro-and nano-patterned magnonic wave <lb/>guides 80,81,82 . <lb/>Nanostructured magnetic materials are known to possess further functionalities that cannot be <lb/>achieved in their bulk constituents. So, the discovery of the phenomenon of giant magneto-resistance <lb/>(GMR) in magnetic multilayers was marked by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 83,84 . GMR read heads and <lb/>those based on the tunnelling magneto-resistance (TMR), consisting of nano-patterned magnetic multilayers, <lb/>are used in modern hard disk reading heads, showing magneto-resistive characteristics remarkably superior <lb/>to those found in natural continuous magnetic materials. Other examples are given by metallic magnetic <lb/>multilayers with high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy 85,86 and multilayered magnetic dielectric films (so <lb/>called magneto-photonic crystals 87 ) that show such noteworthy effects as giant Faraday rotation 88 and <lb/>unidirectional propagation of light 89 . <lb/>The properties of spin waves in nano-structured systems win a new degree of freedom connected with <lb/>a inhomogeneous internal magnetic field due to the structuring. Periodically structured materials play a <lb/>special role for magnonics. Indeed, the propagation of waves in periodically structured materials is of <lb/></body>

			<body>fundamental interest for modern physics and technology 90 . In particular, a lot of research efforts have been <lb/>applied to artificial electromagnetic materials with periodic modulation of the refractive index in one, two or <lb/>three dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D respectively), with periodicity comparable to the wavelength of light. <lb/>These materials are known as photonic crystals or photonic band gap structures 91 , and are already finding <lb/>practical applications in opto-electronics 92 . Plasmonic 93 and phononic 94 crystals and semiconductor <lb/>superlattices 95 are other typical and widely known examples of exploitation of the spatial periodicity for <lb/>controlling propagation and scattering of light, phonons and electrons in electronic, opto-electronic, and <lb/>acousto-electronic devices. <lb/>Therefore, periodically modulated magnetic materials are now explored to form magnonic crystals 96 , <lb/>i.e., a magnetic analogue of photonic crystals. Indeed, the spin wave spectrum has been modified by <lb/>patterning 97 and shows a tailored band structure in periodic magnetic materials 98 . The band spectrum <lb/>consists of bands of allowed magnonic states and forbidden-frequency gaps (&quot;band gaps&quot;), in which there are <lb/>no allowed magnonic states. One of the first attempts to study the propagation of spin waves in periodic <lb/>magnetic structures was made by Elachi 99 . Nowadays, the number of studies on this topic has surged and <lb/>continues to grow at a fast pace. <lb/>Here, we review the history and current state of the art in magnonics and discuss challenges that need <lb/>to be addressed in the future in order to implement magnonic devices in real-life applications. <lb/>2. MAGNONIC DEVICES <lb/>The modern research on fundamental properties of materials is increasingly driven by their anticipated <lb/>potential for technological applications. Generally speaking, due to particular properties of spin-wave <lb/>spectra, magnonic devices should offer important new functionalities that are currently unavailable in e.g. <lb/>photonic and electronic devices. For example, magnonic devices are easily manipulated by the applied <lb/>magnetic field. Moreover, magnetic nano-structures are non-volatile memory elements, and therefore, their <lb/>integration will enable programmable devices with the ultrafast re-programming at the sub-nanosecond time <lb/>scale. In magnetic data storage media magnetic nano-structures have already been combined with nano-<lb/>electronics (e.g. in read heads and magnetic random access memories) and optics (e.g. in magneto-optical <lb/>disks). Hence, magnonic devices offer the integration with microwave electronics and photonic devices at <lb/>the same time. Since for all practically relevant situations (at the GHz to THz frequency range), the <lb/>wavelength of spin waves is several orders of magnitude shorter than that of electromagnetic waves, <lb/>magnonic devices offer better prospects for miniaturisation at these frequencies. <lb/>Macroscopic magnetic devices have been demonstrated and implemented in microwave technology <lb/>already some time ago 100 . Indeed, soft ferrites were used to fabricate linear and nonlinear devices based on <lb/>magnetostatic spin waves (MSSWs) and operated at frequencies up to 70 GHz. Recently, the interest to <lb/>ferrites has been revived to study fundamental wave properties of magnetisation dynamics in <lb/>patterned 101,102,103 and, specifically, periodic 104,105 structures. However, in order to truly demonstrate the rich <lb/>technological potential of magnonics, one has to design and to build nanoscale functional magnonic devices, <lb/>in particular those suitable for monolithic integration into existing complementary metal-oxide-<lb/>semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. For example, the integration into monolithic microwave integrated circuits <lb/>(MMIC) has so far been a severe challenge for ferrites. Metallic ferromagnets need to be explored to <lb/>substitute ferrites for integration at the nanoscale. This motivates the discussion of potential applications of <lb/>nanoscale (presumably metallic) magnonic crystals and devices presented below. <lb/>Let us begin by considering a generic magnonic device shown in Figure 1. Typically, any such device <lb/>should contain at least four structural elements: a source and a detector of spin waves, a functional medium <lb/>by which the spin wave signal is manipulated between the input and the output, and an external control block <lb/>which is required to either re-program or to dynamically control the device. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1 <lb/>(Colour online) A block diagram of a generic magnonic device is shown. The <lb/>device comprises a source, a detector of spin waves (SWs), and a functional <lb/>medium in which the spin wave signal is manipulated (controlled) using an <lb/>external means. The red arrows denote coupling between the different <lb/>structural elements of the device. <lb/>The most commonly and thoroughly studied magnonic device is shown in Figure 2. MSSWs are <lb/>injected into a ferrite (usually YIG) waveguide (C) using an inductive input antenna (A). The latter can have <lb/>a number of different geometries used in microwave engineering, e.g. a coplanar wave guide (CPW) or <lb/>transmission line. The phase and / or amplitude of MSSWs are varied in the functional region (D) and the <lb/>result is read out inductively by a further antenna (B). The functional region can have a form of either a <lb/>&quot;built in&quot; profile of magnetic / structural parameters 105,106,107 , a local modification of the magnetic <lb/>field 44,102,108,109,110 , or a uniform magnetic field 108,111 , in which case region D virtually coincides with C. The <lb/>waveguide C itself has been used as the functional region D in that the inherent non-linearity of <lb/>magnetisation dynamics and hence the MSSWs has been exploited e.g. as a phase shifting mechanism 112,113 . <lb/>Region D can host a functional non-uniformity provided by a local barrier (&quot;defect&quot;) for SW <lb/>propagation 44,108,109 or an extended (distributed) device such as a magnonic crystal 105,106,107,114 . When an <lb/>Oersted magnetic field is used to manipulate MSSWs, the functional region can be either static 102,108,109 , or <lb/>dynamic 110,114 . In the latter case, &quot;slow&quot; (quasi-static) and fast manipulation (at the frequency close to or <lb/>higher than that of the signal) should also be distinguished. <lb/>When the functional region D is uniform and exhibits (quasi-)static characteristics, the device can act <lb/>as a phase shifter or a delay line. If D is operated in a fast or dynamic mode, the device can be used to <lb/>manipulate the frequency and / or to amplify the amplitude of the SW signal 115 , i.e. as a frequency mixer and <lb/>/ or SW amplifier, respectively. If D is non-uniform, the device acts as a magnonic filter. In the non-linear <lb/>regime, the device can be used to construct a power selective filter 113 . With D consisting of two localised <lb/>magnetic field regions, the device can act as a dynamically controlled source of short trains of MSSWs 110 . <lb/>A <lb/>D <lb/>C <lb/>B <lb/>Figure 2 <lb/>(Colour online) A generic MSSW device is schematically shown. A and B <lb/>denote the input and output antennas. C is the waveguide for spin waves. D is <lb/>the functional region, where spin wave manipulation takes place. <lb/>The devices of the type shown in Figure 2 can be connected together to build interferometers and logic <lb/>gates, as was demonstrated e.g. in Refs. 108,109,111,112. However, such devices have used external <lb/>microwave circuits to evaluate results of the manipulation of spin waves and hence had macroscopic <lb/>dimensions. Logic architectures in which logic output is derived directly from the spin wave signal (e.g. via <lb/>spin wave interference) were proposed theoretically in Refs. 116,117,118. Experimentally, spin wave <lb/>interference was observed in the response of microscopic rings to uniform microwave field 119,120,121,122 . <lb/>However, experimental demonstration of an all-magnonic interferometer or logic gate is still a challenge for <lb/>the researchers. The closest to all-magnonic design of logic gates was developed in Refs. 123,124, and <lb/></body>

			<body>recent progress will be reviewed by the authors in a separate paper of this cluster. It is also important to note <lb/>that in all-magnonic logic gate designs developed so far non-magnonic signals (e.g. electrical currents) are <lb/>used as the input whereas the output is based on spin waves. Therefore, combining several such gates in <lb/>series necessarily involves conversion of the spin waves into electrical currents, which is always associated <lb/>with additional power losses. <lb/>Magnonic devices discussed in Refs. 116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124 were all based on <lb/>magnonic waveguides made of ferromagnetic metals. Such waveguides are known to experience a larger <lb/>SW damping if compared to ferrites. Moreover, the geometric confinement of spin waves in the nanostripe <lb/>geometry can itself affect the SW damping, e.g. via enhancement of damping due to a nonlinear resonant <lb/>three-magnon confluence process that occurs at a particular bias field determined by the quantised SW spin-<lb/>wave spectrum in the waveguide 125 . However, it has been demonstrated that spin waves in such metallic <lb/>magnonic waveguide can also be confined to the sub-100-nm length scale in channels that are remote from <lb/>the edges 80,81 . Such spin waves can be expected to experience reduced scattering from the always present <lb/>edge roughness, and thus to have a longer relaxation length. <lb/>In order to use the magnonic device shown in Figure 2 as a magnetic field controlled logic element, <lb/>one must be able to shift the SW phase by π in region D shown in Figure 2. This might be accomplished by <lb/>changing the SW wave number k by varying the value of the bias magnetic field H, which is used as to <lb/>control the magnonic device performance. The required variation of H depends upon the derivative <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> g <lb/>v <lb/>H <lb/>k <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>k <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where v g and ω are the group velocity and frequency of the spin wave, respectively 117 . Considering <lb/>exchange-dominated spin waves at this point one gets <lb/>2 <lb/>k <lb/>h  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>, where α is the exchange constant of the <lb/>material. From this, one finds <lb/>h <lb/>h <lb/>k <lb/> <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>, where h=H/M 0 . Thus, the shorter is the wavelength of the <lb/>spin waves, the larger change of the bias magnetic field is required to change the output from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;1&quot;. <lb/>This may present a serious limitation if miniaturisation of magnonic logic devices is desired. Furthermore, <lb/>since the group velocity of spin waves appears in the denominator of equation (1), one may also need to <lb/>compromise between the efficiency of the magnetic field control and the speed of operation of such a device. <lb/>The most efficient control by the applied magnetic field is achieved for dipole-exchange spin waves in the <lb/>backward volume geometry, which have a characteristic minimum in their frequency at a particular finite <lb/>value of the wave number. This might explain why all magnonic logic devices demonstrated so far have <lb/>been implemented using MSSWs. A way around might be offered by either using a localized domain wall as <lb/>a phase shifter 116 or embedding a magnonic crystal into the magnonic wave guide. In magnonic crystals (e.g. <lb/>such as those from Refs. 126,127), the dispersion of spin waves contains regions of reduced group velocity <lb/>in the vicinity of magnonic band gaps 128 . Hence, the use of spin waves with frequency near the band gap <lb/>edges as signal carriers could lead to more efficient and miniature magnonic logic devices. Of course, this <lb/>consideration is not limited to devices based on inductive antennas and ferrite magnonic waveguides, but is <lb/>of general relevance. <lb/>A particular type of magnonic devices is associated with BEC of magnons. Contrary to the above <lb/>discussed systems, such devices are not connected with data processing, but they can be used to build a <lb/>source of coherent microwave radiation 129 . In fact, although the currently implemented microwave sources <lb/>span a very broad spectrum of devices (from vacuum klystrons to spin-torque nano-oscillators), all of them <lb/>convert dc-current into microwaves. A completely different physical mechanism for creation of spin waves <lb/>via the conversion of an incoherent electromagnetic radiation into coherent microwaves, which takes <lb/>advantage of BEC is illustrated in Figure 3 (a), where the dependence of the magnon frequency in an in-<lb/>plane magnetized ferromagnetic film is plotted as a function of the two-dimensional in-plane wavevector of <lb/>the magnon. The dependence shows two degenerated minima, corresponding to two symmetric points on the <lb/>wavevector plane. Magnons with frequencies higher than that of the minima are excited by means of an <lb/>external incoherent source as it is shown in Figure 3 (a). Due to magnon-magnon interaction the excited <lb/>magnons are thermalized and a quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic distribution in the magnon gas is <lb/>achieved 130 . If the density of magnons at quasi-equilibrium reaches a certain critical limit, BEC of magnons <lb/>occurs, which is illustrated in Figure 3 (a) by two narrow peaks in the magnon distribution close to the <lb/>minima As a result, the coherent macroscopic magnon state appears, accumulating an essential part of the <lb/>energy of the magnon gas. In this way the energy accumulated by the magnon gas from the incoherent <lb/>pumping field is transformed by the Bose-Einstein condensation into monochromatic microwave radiation. <lb/>Figure 3 (b) shows the frequency spectrum of the radiation detected in YIG films under condition of BEC 129 . <lb/></body>

			<body>While the frequency of the emitted coherent radiation is controlled by the applied magnetic field, its spectral <lb/>width is below 6 MHz. <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>Figure 3 <lb/>(Colour online) (a) The frequency of magnons in an in-plane magnetized <lb/>YIG-film is shown as a function of the in-plane wavevector. Magnons are <lb/>excited by microwave photons and form a quasi-equilibrium magnon gas due <lb/>to thermalization. Two peaks in the magnon population indicate formation of <lb/>BEC. (b) The spectrum of the microwave radiation emitted by the condensate <lb/>is shown. Note that the value of the maximum frequency is determined by the <lb/>applied magnetic field (After Ref. 129). <lb/>3. MAGNONIC CRYSTALS <lb/>Spin waves in individual magnetic thin films have attracted enormous interest in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s of <lb/>the last century 131 . Following Ref. 99, the research focus shifted to magnetic superlattices in the 80&apos;s. Along <lb/>the growth direction these superlattices can be viewed as 1D magnonic crystals. They consist of a sequence <lb/>of layers with alternating magnetic properties and are probably the best studied systems in which the <lb/>spectrum <lb/>of <lb/>magnons <lb/>has <lb/>a <lb/>band <lb/>structure <lb/>and <lb/>contains <lb/>band <lb/>gaps 132,133,134,135.136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162 . We note that the <lb/>authors of Ref. 163 have shown that the strong dispersion in the vicinity of band-gaps in the magnonic <lb/>spectrum of magnetic superlattices could be used to excite dipole-exchange spin wave envelope solitons. <lb/>Such solitons might prove useful for creation of digital rather than analogue magnonic logic. Also, <lb/>interesting spectra can be observed not only in the case of periodic but also quasi-periodic and fractal <lb/>magnetic structures 158,164,165 . <lb/>From the point of view of fabrication and practical applications, magnonic crystals and devices with a <lb/>planar geometry and, ideally, fabricated from a single magnetic material are preferred. Magnonic crystals <lb/>fabricated by periodic corrugation of YIG and ferromagnetic metallic films were studied in Refs. 166,167 <lb/>and 168 respectively. <lb/>Magnonic crystals formed by lateral patterning of a magnetic film with uniform thickness were <lb/>theoretically studied in Refs. 169,170 (1D comb-like structures represented by a ferromagnetic wire with <lb/>periodically situated dangling branches) and in Ref. 171 (asymmetric loops). A combination of the two <lb/>structures was studied in Ref. 172. More details of the studies can be found in a review published in Ref. <lb/>173. However, due to the complicated geometry, it can be difficult, if at all possible, to take into account <lb/>analytically the long-range magneto-dipole interaction within such samples. Hence, numerical methods have <lb/>to be used instead. So, magnonic crystals produced by periodically varying the width of a magnetic stripe <lb/>were proposed and numerically studied in Refs. 126,127. Planar 1D magnonic crystals formed by alternating <lb/>stripes of two different magnetic materials were studied in Refs. 174,175, although magnonic band gaps <lb/>were observed only in the latter work. <lb/>2D magnonic crystals were proposed in Ref. 176,177, where the spectrum of dipole-exchange spin <lb/>waves propagating in the plane of a magnonic crystal was discussed. The magnonic crystal consisted of <lb/></body>

			<body>periodically arranged infinitely long ferromagnetic cylinders embedded in a matrix of a different <lb/>ferromagnetic material. The position and width of band gaps in the magnonic spectrum were investigated as <lb/>a function of the period of the structure and the depth of modulation depth (&quot;contrast&quot;) of the magnetic <lb/>parameters. It was found that the depth of modulation of the exchange parameter has a drastic effect upon <lb/>the position and width of the band gaps. In Ref. 106, it was shown that a ferrite film with periodically etched <lb/>holes can serve as a filter for MSSWs propagating in the film plane. Collective dynamics of lattices of <lb/>magnetic vortices was studied in Refs. 178,179. FMR and time resolved scanning Kerr microscopy <lb/>(TRSKM) were used to study localisation of spin waves in an array of antidots formed in a metallic <lb/>ferromagnetic film in Ref. 180. Vector network analyser ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) <lb/>measurements and micromagnetic simulations were used to demonstrate a control of spin wave transmission <lb/>through a similar array of antidots by an external magnetic field in Refs. 181,182 (Figure 4). Recently, such <lb/>VNA-FMR measurements were complemented by Brillouin light scattering experiments on the same antidot <lb/>array 183 . By this means standing and propagating waves were evidenced. <lb/>(a) <lb/>i rf <lb/>(b) <lb/>Figure 4 <lb/>(Colour online) (a) Sketch of a CPW integrated to an antidot lattice prepared <lb/>from a thin Permalloy film. The CPW consists of three metallic leads <lb/>(ground-signal-ground leads). Adjusting the dimensions of the CPW allows <lb/>one to vary the profile of the magnetic field generated by microwave current i rf <lb/>supplied by the VNA. This defines the wave vector transferred to the sample. <lb/>The same CPW picks up the voltage induced by precessing spins. (b) <lb/>Simulated spatial distributions of spin precession amplitudes reflecting two <lb/>different standing spin-wave excitations. The film is assumed to be 26 nm <lb/>thick. The period (hole diameter) is 490 (240) nm. A magnetic field of a few <lb/>10 mT is applied in horizontal direction. The mode pattern shown on the right <lb/>belongs to a localized mode that has frequency higher than that of the <lb/>extended mode shown on the left. (After Ref. 182) Bright colours correspond <lb/>to large amplitudes. The holes are shown in white. <lb/>Generally, patterning of thin magnetic films leads to creation of arrays of non-ellipsoidal magnetic <lb/>elements. In such elements, the internal magnetic effective field is non-uniform, breaking the translational <lb/>symmetry and introducing additional complexity into the SW mode spectrum. The interpretation of the <lb/>precessional dynamics in non-ellipsoidal elements becomes even more involved at small values of the <lb/>applied magnetic field when the elements have a non-uniform static magnetic state. Recent studies of micro-<lb/>and nanoscale magnetic elements revealed phenomena of localisation of magnons 119,121,184,185,186,187,188,189 , <lb/>magnonic nano-optics 80 , guiding of magnons via deep sub-µm SW channels 81,82 (Figure 5), and anisotropic <lb/>coupling of square arrays of disc shaped magnetic elements 190 . Recently, the emphasis of such research has <lb/>shifted to collective dynamic phenomena. For example, the spectrum of magnons in closely packed 1D <lb/>arrays of magnetic nano-elements was shown to have band structure, with Brillouin zone boundaries <lb/>determined by the artificial periodicity of the arrays 191 . Giovannini et al showed that spin waves in closely <lb/>packed 2D arrays of magnetic nano-elements also form a magnonic band structure 192 . <lb/></body>

Magnonic band structure of 3D all-ferromagnetic magnonic crystals was calculated by <lb/>Krawczyk and Puszkarski 195,196 . Here, again the depth of modulation of magnetic parameters is essential to <lb/>generate magnon bands and forbidden-frequency gaps of significant width. <lb/>4. EXCITATION AND DETECTION OF SPIN WAVES <lb/>The excitation and detection of spin waves is the major technological challenge for realization of <lb/>magnonic devices. Experimentally, even small signal levels are often sufficient to study spin waves either <lb/>propagating or forming standing eigenmodes in magnonic crystals and more generally magnetic <lb/>nanostructures. In commercial applications, the efficiency of the spin wave excitation and detection will <lb/>determine the power consumption and error rates of magnonic devices. Hence, it is instructive to revisit <lb/>techniques used in research labs to detect spin waves and to consider them through the prism of their <lb/>potential use in applications, e.g. within devices shown in Figure 2. <lb/>To excite the precessional motion of the magnetisation, one can use harmonic 197 or pulsed 198 rf <lb/>magnetic fields, ultrashort optical pulses 199,200,201 , or dc or rf spin polarized currents 202 . The stimuli can <lb/>therefore be referred to as a &quot;pump&quot;. The same basic interactions and phenomena facilitate the detection of <lb/>spins and spin waves. For example, a magnonics researcher can take advantage of inductive 203,204 , <lb/>optical 205,206 , or electrical 207,208 probes to detect spin waves. The main challenge and limitations of any such <lb/>technique are associated with difficulties to match the frequency and wavelength of spin waves and those in <lb/>the spectra of the pump and / or the probe. <lb/>The cavity based FMR was historically the first experimental technique used to detect precession of <lb/>magnetisation 7 by measuring spectra of the absorption of microwaves in the cavity containing a magnetic <lb/>sample. The spectra are determined by the density of states of spin waves that can resonantly couple to the <lb/>microwave field. The very long wavelength of microwaves, as compared to the length scale of magnetic <lb/>structures of interest, limits the application of the FMR in magnonics to studies of magnonic modes with <lb/>significant Fourier amplitude at nearly zero values of the wave vector 54 . This mimics potential applications <lb/>in which either the electromagnetic response of a magnonic device containing nano-structured functional <lb/>magnetic elements is read out by electromagnetic field, or the magnonic (meta-)material 209 is supposed to <lb/></body>

			<body>absorb the incident electromagnetic radiation. Continuous magnetic materials and arrays of non-interacting <lb/>magnetic elements appear preferred for such applications near the frequency of the uniform FMR. However, <lb/>more sophisticated micromagnetic engineering is required to push up the frequency of operation of such <lb/>materials e.g. using the exchange field 210,211 , which originates from the strongest of the magnetic interactions, <lb/>rather than the uniform anisotropy or applied magnetic field. <lb/>The FMR is conventionally used to study magnetisation dynamics at frequencies up to about 100 GHz. <lb/>At higher frequencies, the mismatch between the linear momentum of free space electromagnetic radiation <lb/>(photon) and that of a magnon increasingly prohibits an efficient coupling. Therefore, higher frequencies <lb/>require one to use different experimental and technical concepts by which to interrogate and measure e.g. <lb/>THz magnons. Here, methods, known e.g. from plasmonics, might help to couple light to magnons. For <lb/>example, the attenuated total reflection technique has been successfully applied to studies of magnons in <lb/>antiferromagnets 212,213,214 . This field of research is still at its infancy. <lb/>The VNA-FMR technique represents a relatively new twist in the FMR spectroscopy where VNA <lb/>highlights the use of a broadband vector network analyzer (VNA) operated in the GHz frequency regime. <lb/>Microwaves applied to a waveguide locally excite spin waves that in turn induce a high-frequency voltage <lb/>due to precessing magnetisation (Figure 4 (a)). The VNA-FMR technique measures spectra of both the <lb/>amplitude and phase change of microwaves passing through a magnetic sample integrated with the <lb/>waveguide 215,216,217 . The geometrical parameters of the waveguide determine the spatial distribution of the rf <lb/>magnetic field and therefore the wavelength spectrum addressed by the microwave field. Hence, the VNA-<lb/>FMR can be also referred to as a &quot;near field&quot; FMR. In the same way as e.g. near field optical microscopy 218 , <lb/>the microwave near field allows one to couple to spin waves with wavelengths of the order of the size of the <lb/>microwave waveguide. The technique is therefore limited mainly by the resolution of lithographical tools <lb/>used to pattern the wave guides as well as by the electrical noises in the circuitry and Joule losses in narrow <lb/>waveguides. Due to the large penetration depth of microwaves, both thin film and bulk samples can be <lb/>successfully investigated using the VNA-FMR. Sensitivity necessary to detect magnons in a single micron-<lb/>sized magnet has been demonstrated 138 . Measurements have also been performed down to helium <lb/>temperatures 219 , which is essential for studies of samples that are super-paramagnetic at room and <lb/>ferromagnetic at cryogenic temperatures. Time resolved pulsed inductive microwave magnetometry (TR <lb/>PIMM) represents a variation of the VNA-FMR technique in which the electric signal inductively picked up <lb/>by the waveguide is analysed using a fast oscilloscope 220 . The FMR technique can also be used in a FMR-<lb/>force spectroscopy 221 and localised probe 222,223 modes to study spin waves locally, e.g. in individual <lb/>micrometer sized magnetic elements. <lb/>The BLS technique is based on the phenomenon of Brillouin-Mandelstam inelastic scattering of <lb/>photons from either thermal, or externally pumped magnons 205 . The frequency and the wave vector of the <lb/>scattered photons are shifted by amounts equal to the frequency and the wave vector of the scattering <lb/>magnons, respectively. This facilitates a direct mapping of the magnonic dispersion in the reciprocal <lb/>space 98,175 . Because of the wave vector conservation in the magnon-photon interaction, the wavelength of <lb/>spin waves that can be detected in extended systems is of the same order of magnitude as that of light. <lb/>Recently, the technique was modified to allow spatially resolved detection (imaging) of spin wave modes in <lb/>magnetic structures of finite size (micro-focus BLS) 224,225,226 . In the micro-focus BLS measurements, the <lb/>wave vector resolution is sacrificed in favour of the spatial resolution. The latter is determined by the <lb/>smallest achievable optical spot size (about 250 nm for blue light), which is again limited by the optical <lb/>wavelength. Recently, a phase sensitive micro-focus BLS technique has also been demonstrated 227,228 . BLS <lb/>measurements are quite demanding to the surface quality of studied samples. Nonetheless, they have been <lb/>applied to such &quot;rough&quot; samples as granular 229 and rod 230 nanocomposites. <lb/>At present, it is difficult to envisage the BLS technique to be implemented in commercial magnonic <lb/>devices for detection of spin waves. However, an interesting opportunity lies in using the inelastic light <lb/>scattering for spin wave amplification 231 , in particular in light of the recent discovery of room temperature <lb/>BEC of magnons 63 . The sensitivity of BLS is limited to the surface region thinner than optical skin depth <lb/>and requires a high surface quality of the studied samples. Cochran pointed out that only &quot;acoustic&quot; spin <lb/>wave modes of a superlattice, in which magnetic moments of different layers precess in phase and which <lb/>corresponds to the first Brillouin band of the spectrum, can be observed in a BLS experiment 232 . The higher <lb/>frequency modes have an &quot;optical&quot; character with magnetic moments precessing out of phase, which reduces <lb/>the BLS signal from such modes dramatically. <lb/>Another way of probing magnetisation is offered by measuring a change in polarisation of light <lb/>reflected from or transmitted through a magnetic sample, due to the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday <lb/></body>

			<body>Effects, respectively. In a time-resolved magneto-optical experiment, the sample is pumped by a method <lb/>capable of exciting spin waves (cf. techniques discussed above), provided that the pump is both repetitive <lb/>and coherent, i.e. it has a well defined phase with respect to the probe beam. By changing the optical path of <lb/>the probe beam one can trace the time evolution of the excited dynamics. To probe, one uses ultrashort <lb/>optical pulses and controls their arrival time relative to the pump. The so-called time-resolved scanning Kerr <lb/>microscopy (TRSKM) uses a focussed probe beam which is scanned on the surface of the sample. The <lb/>TRSKM provides images of the dynamic magnetisation with a spatial resolution of down to 250 nm in real <lb/>space 233,234,235,236 , and is suitable for studying both continuous and nanostructured samples, as demonstrated <lb/>in Figure 6. This is complementary to the micro-focus BLS. The temporal resolution of TRSKM can be <lb/>well on the sub-ps time scale, therefore offering the detection of spin waves in the THz frequency regime. <lb/>The TRSKM performs a 3D vectorial analysis of the time dependent magnetization 237 and is therefore phase <lb/>sensitive. Alternatively, one can combine the magneto-optical detection with a VNA-FMR setup to image <lb/>spin wave modes in the frequency rather than time domain 238 . The experimental setup is analogous to that in <lb/>the VNA-FMR, except that the magnetisation dynamics (spin waves) in the sample are probed using a <lb/>combination of a continuous wave laser and a GHz bandwidth polarisation sensitive photo-detector rather <lb/>than an inductive probe. <lb/>Figure 6 <lb/>(Colour online) The fast Fourier transform (FFT) power spectrum calculated <lb/>from a time resolved Kerr signal acquired from the center of a 4 x 4 μm 2 array <lb/>of 40 x 80 nm 2 stadium shaped ferromagnetic elements at a bias magnetic field <lb/>of 197 Oe is shown on a logarithmic scale together with the fit to a Lorentzian <lb/>3-peak function. The inset shows images of the modes confined within the <lb/>entire array and corresponding to the peak frequencies identified from the fit. <lb/>The darker shades of gray correspond to greater mode amplitude. With <lb/>respect to the long wavelength spin wave modes, the array acts as a continuous <lb/>element made of a magnonic metamaterial. Such arrays will also act as <lb/>metamaterials with respect to microwaves. Reproduced with permission from <lb/>Ref. 209.

The spatial resolution of the time resolved technique <lb/></body>

			<body>could be improved using the magnetic second harmonic generation (MSHG) to detect magnetization <lb/>dynamics at surfaces and interfaces 242 . <lb/>The magneto-optical techniques have a modest outlook for being implemented with magnonic <lb/>applications due to the large sizes of lasers and microwave detectors currently involved in the corresponding <lb/>experiments. However, the situation might well change in future due to the ongoing research to miniaturise <lb/>devices in optical recording and microwave communication technologies. <lb/>At synchrotron radiation facilities, techniques based on time resolved x-ray magnetic circular <lb/>dichroism (TR XMCD) have recently advanced a lot and provide the advantage of element selectivity 243,244 . <lb/>However, in order to probe high frequency magnonic excitations, the time resolution needs to be improved <lb/>further. Inelastic scattering using particle-like waves is known to address short wavelength spin waves due <lb/>to increased momentum transfer. For example, there is also a promise from the inelastic neutron scattering <lb/>to map spectra of short wavelength spin waves in superlattices 245 . Spin-polarized electron energy loss <lb/>spectroscopy has already been shown to generate and detect high energy, large wave vector spin waves in <lb/>ultrathin ferromagnetic films 246 . Shortly afterwards magnonic dispersions on the nanoscale have been <lb/>recorded using inelastic tunnelling of electrons from a scanning probe microscope 247 , 248 . <lb/>Let us now analyse the limitations imposed on SW frequency and wavelength addressed by the <lb/>various methods. For electrical techniques, the spectrum of excited spin waves is generally determined by <lb/>that of the transient behaviour of the dynamical stimulus (pump). The inductive excitation is suggested to be <lb/>powerful up to the frequency range up to about 100 GHz. A higher coupling efficiency can be provided by <lb/>&quot;wrapping&quot; the magnonic waveguide around the microwave one 249 . Although some recipes for producing <lb/>near field microwave wave forms have been proposed even for THz range 250,251 , at higher frequencies, it <lb/>becomes increasingly difficult to couple microwaves to metallic waveguides. The maximum wave vector <lb/>that is transferred by such waveguides scales with the inverse width of the signal line. Considering state of <lb/>the art lithography one might reach a deep-sub-micrometer width here. However, at the same time the <lb/>resistance increases and Ohmic losses as well as Joule heating will become a problem. In order to reduce the <lb/>magnonic wavelength beyond lithographic limitations, one has to take advantage of the exchange interaction, <lb/>which offers the shortest range, i.e., the atomistic length scale, and is the strongest of magnetic interactions. <lb/>For example, in Ref. 252, it was demonstrated that the reversal of the magnetic vortex core results in a strong <lb/>emission of short-wavelength spin waves. One could extend this concept of SW excitation via &quot;exchange <lb/>explosion&quot; to the annihilation of domain walls in narrow nanowires. The required technology of domain wall <lb/>creation is already well developed 253,254,255,256 . <lb/>An attractive solution seems to be in use of interfaces providing exchange coupling between the <lb/>ferromagnetic material of a magnonic waveguide and some further magnetic material offering ultrafast <lb/>dynamics, e.g. an antiferromagnet 257,258 . One such scheme was proposed in Ref. 76. First, the <lb/>antiferromagnet is excited e.g. using either a femtosecond optical pulse 257,258,259,260 or THz wave 212,214 . The <lb/>THz waves can directly couple to spin waves in antiferromagnets more easily than in ferromagnets since the <lb/>spin wave frequency in the former generally scales with the square root of the exchange field 214,257 . The <lb/>optical excitation can be either thermal 259,260 or non-thermal 200,257,258 . The spin wave in the antiferromagnet <lb/>then couples to the ferromagnet, in which the spin wave can be manipulated e.g. using means discussed <lb/>above. The coupling is possible since the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet interact via the exchange field <lb/>localised in the atomically thin region at the interface. The spin wave signal is then transferred from the <lb/>ferromagnet to another antiferromagnet (again across the interface) from which the signal is read out. In <lb/>principle, the magnonic waveguide could also be antiferromagnetic, in which case any scattering at the <lb/>interfaces is avoided but new means to manipulate the spin wave will have to be developed. <lb/>Finally, we note rich opportunities existing in application of spintronics methods to magnonic <lb/>studies 48,67,261,262 . This however is very broad field of research that can well be a subject of a separate review <lb/>and is therefore beyond the scope of this review. <lb/>5. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS <lb/>Arguably, nano-fabrication is the core of modern technological progress and will remain such in <lb/>future. In the context of nanoscale magnonics, the principle nano-manufacturing challenge is to fabricate <lb/>micrometer to millimetre scale periodic structures consisting of or containing magnetic materials precisely <lb/>and controllably tailored at the nanometre scale. This challenge is certainly at the limit of current <lb/>lithographic tools. Hence, bottom-up technologies might have to be exploited instead. For example, protein <lb/>based colloidal crystallisation techniques can be used to produce macroscopic 3D ordered magnetic <lb/></body>

			<body>arrays 263,264 . In order to integrate such arrays into magnonic devices, researchers will need to combine the <lb/>protein based nano-manufacturing with such more conventional top-down techniques as laser-interference <lb/>lithography 265 , focused ion beam (FIB) and electron-beam lithography and with such advanced 3D material <lb/>deposition techniques as atomic layer deposition (ALD) 266 and electrodeposition tailored for use with <lb/>multiple magnetic materials. ALD film growth is self-limited, thereby achieving atomic scale control of the <lb/>deposition. Recently, ALD was used to deposit ferromagnetic thin-films (such as Ni, Co, Fe 3 O 4 ) into deep-<lb/>etched trenches and membranes 267,268,269 . The complementary topology is also possible by, e.g., conformal <lb/>coating of templates consisting of tailored nanowires 270 . Such possibilities make ALD a promising tool by <lb/>which to fabricate 3D magnonic devices. Electrodeposition is also very well suited for deposition into <lb/>complex templates 271 . It is fast and thereby suitable for scaling-up to produce large numbers of devices. For <lb/>example, arrays of cylindrical magnetic nanowires deposited electrochemically within porous <lb/>membranes 272,273,274 have attracted much attention due to their potential for use as microwave 275 and THz 276 <lb/>devices, and recording media 277 . Reprogrammable dynamic response has been demonstrated through <lb/>different remanent states of planar arrays of nanomagnets 278 . The reconfiguration of a 1D magnonic crystal <lb/>has recently been demonstrated via variation of the orientation of neighbouring ferromagnetic nanowires <lb/>from a parallel to anti-parallel magnetic states (Figure 7) 279 . Experiments and simulations have shown that <lb/>spin waves propagating perpendicular to the long axis of such coupled nanowires experience different <lb/>artificial magnonic band structures in configurations (a) and (b). Magnonic dispersions have thus become <lb/>reprogrammable. Such characteristics applied to complex 3D magnonic devices might generate unforeseen <lb/>functionalities. Quasi-static 280 , 281 and, more visionary, GHz-modulated strain by surface acoustic waves 282 <lb/>might also be used to reconfigure the magnetic state 283 and the dynamic response at remanence. These <lb/>techniques offer new routes to the control of magnonic devices by electrical fields complementing already <lb/>existing means based, e.g., on external magnetic fields and electric currents 228 . Magnonic devices fabricated <lb/>directly from multiferroic materials or multilayers 284 promise unprecedented characteristics and multi-<lb/>functionality. <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>Figure 7 <lb/>(Colour online) Two different remanent magnetic configurations of a 1D <lb/>magnonic crystal formed by interacting ferromagnetic nanowires are shown <lb/>for (a) parallel and (b) anti-parallel alignment of neighbouring nanowires. <lb/>Arrows illustrate the orientation of the magnetization of the individual <lb/>nanowires. In (b), the magnetic unit cell of the magnonic crystal is twice as <lb/>large as the geometrical one, suggesting zone folding effects of magnon <lb/>dispersions in the reciprocal space. <lb/>Concerning materials research it is of utmost importance to create materials with greatly reduced <lb/>values of the magnetic damping parameter. Such materials should be in particular compatible with the <lb/>advanced nano-fabrication techniques. For example, the latter requirement renders existing microwave <lb/>ferrites unsuitable for magnonic architectures. Permalloy is currently the most widely used ferromagnetic <lb/>material with a low damping parameter down to α = 0.008 285,286,287 . This has so far been sufficient to <lb/>generate coherent effects such as spin-wave interference on the micrometer scale 122 . However, at least an <lb/>order of magnitude reduction of the value is required to make the magnonic technology competitive. It is <lb/>interesting to note that the same issue is faced by the spin transfer torque technology 288,289,290 . Effects <lb/>connected with modulation of the damping strength that is expected to occur in magnonic crystals were <lb/>studied in Refs. 75,156,291 for 1D magnonic crystals. In particular, it was found that the effective damping <lb/>of spin waves varies from a band to band, leading to anomalously weak attenuation in cases when the <lb/>amplitude of spin waves is &quot;concentrated&quot; in layers with weaker damping. Recently, in Ref. 292, the <lb/>calculations have been extended to the case of 2D magnonic crystals similar to those considered in Refs. <lb/>74,177. It was suggested that the variation of the effective damping could be used for channelling of spin <lb/>waves along directions where the reduced damping is observed. <lb/></body>

			<body>The periodicity of magnonic crystals and inherent non-uniform magnetic fields within their constituent <lb/>elements not only offer a range of opportunities to control magnons, but also make their propagation <lb/>remarkably more intricate than propagation of e.g. electrons and electromagnetic waves through <lb/>semiconductor superlattices and photonic crystals, respectively. Due to the complexity of magnon <lb/>propagation, the theory of magnonics requires a major improvement in the case of involved 3D topologies. <lb/>In particular, theoretical tools suitable for calculation of the spin wave dispersion and susceptibilities in <lb/>samples with irregular geometries are required. This has led to the development and successful use of <lb/>numerical algorithms to simulate the high frequency magnetization dynamics in real space and <lb/>time 293,294,295,296,297 . However, despite the continuous improvements in the processor speed and computational <lb/>power, micromagnetic simulations are not yet capable of handling large 3D magnetic nano-structures. In the <lb/>dynamical matrix method 298,299 , the sample of an arbitrary shape is discretised into a mesh of cells of equal <lb/>size. The system of linearised equations of motion of magnetisation of individual cells is reduced to an <lb/>eigenvalue problem, with a corresponding system of algebraic equations solved numerically. So far, the <lb/>dynamic matrix method has only been applied to periodic arrays of magnetic particles embedded in a non-<lb/>magnetic medium. Future theoretical approaches will need to incorporate, both, modified magnetic <lb/>interaction between nanoelements and effects of non-linearity in case of large-amplitude spin precession <lb/>excitation in nanomagnet arrays 300 . <lb/>In order to study coupling of magnonic devices to other excitations, a number of further challenges in <lb/>micromagnetic modelling should be addressed. The mathematical formalism of micromagnetic solvers <lb/>should be extended beyond the classical Landau-Lifshitz equation, crossing boundaries with such sub-fields <lb/>of magnetism and, more generally, solid state physics, including e.g. antiferromagnetism and <lb/>ferrimagnetism, semiconductor and metallic spintronics, optics and electromagnetic emission, <lb/>thermodynamics and statistical physics. In many cases, modelling at the atomic scale and a proper account <lb/>of quantum-mechanical effects are essential. To line up with the recent progress in ultrafast science, non-<lb/>equilibrium electron and lattice dynamics should be also rigorously treated. Such diverse phenomena <lb/>naturally extend through very different time and length scales. The anisotropy and exchange fields define <lb/>the frequency of spin waves with wavelengths from the nanometer to micrometer length scales. Magnetic <lb/>domain walls have widths of a few (tens of) nanometers, while the domain structure depends upon the size <lb/>and global shape of the entire sample. The time scales on which magnetic systems respond to external <lb/>perturbation by fields, stress, or temperature vary from femtoseconds in the case of the ultrafast <lb/>demagnetization to hours in the case of slow thermal decay of the magnetisation. A simultaneous and <lb/>accurate account of these different phenomena within the same formalism is infeasible, due to unrealistic <lb/>demands for computational power. Hence, new algorithms and methods are required to bridge the time and <lb/>length scales each extending over several orders of magnitude. Finally, the global challenge for magnonics <lb/>is to scale the experimental research reviewed in the previous sections of this paper to the nanoscale. Indeed, <lb/>the experimental techniques used in magnonics are operated at the limits of their resolution and / or <lb/>sensitivity. Hence, novel techniques breaking the limits are urgently required. <lb/>6. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Brought about by major advances in nanotechnology and magnetic experimental techniques, <lb/>magnonics is a novel interdisciplinary research field benefitting from old roots. Alongside remarkable <lb/>challenges, there are also numbers of unexplored opportunities for further exciting advances and a significant <lb/>potential for practical applications. We hope that this review will guide current and future researchers <lb/>through the challenges towards new fundamental and applied achievements in the field of magnonics. <lb/></body>
