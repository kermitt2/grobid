Kingan 2 ✉ <lb/>Haplotype-resolved genome assemblies are important for understanding how combinations <lb/>of variants impact phenotypes. To date, these assemblies have been best created with <lb/>complex protocols, such as cultured cells that contain a single-haplotype (haploid) genome, <lb/>single cells where haplotypes are separated, or co-sequencing of parental genomes in a trio-<lb/>based approach. These approaches are impractical in most situations. To address this issue, <lb/>we present FALCON-Phase, a phasing tool that uses ultra-long-range Hi-C chromatin <lb/>interaction data to extend phase blocks of partially-phased diploid assembles to chromosome <lb/>or scaffold scale. FALCON-Phase uses the inherent phasing information in Hi-C reads, <lb/>skipping variant calling, and reduces the computational complexity of phasing. Our method is <lb/>validated on three benchmark datasets generated as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project <lb/>(VGP), including human, cow, and zebra finch, for which high-quality, fully haplotype-<lb/>resolved assemblies are available using the trio-based approach. FALCON-Phase is accurate <lb/>without having parental data and performance is better in samples with higher hetero-<lb/>zygosity. For cow and zebra finch the accuracy is 97% compared to 80-91% for human. <lb/>FALCON-Phase is applicable to any draft assembly that contains long primary contigs and <lb/>phased associate contigs. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20536-y <lb/>OPEN <lb/>1 Phase Genomics, Seattle, WA, USA. 2 Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA. 3 Genome Informatics Section, Computational and Statistical Genomics <lb/>Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. 4 Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, <lb/>Seattle, WA, USA. 5 US Meat Animal Research Center, ARS USDA, Clay Center, NE, USA. 6 Davies Research Centre, School of Animal and Veterinary <lb/>Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA, Australia. 7 Vertebrate Genomes Laboratory, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. 8 Howard <lb/>Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 9 Dipartimento di Scienze Animali, della Nutrizione e degli Alimenti, Università <lb/>Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 29122 Piacenza, Italy. 10 Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. 11 Howard <lb/>Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA. ✉ email: zkronenberg@pacificbiosciences.com; skingan@pacificbiosciences.com <lb/>NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:1935 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20536-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications <lb/>1 <lb/>1234567890():,; <lb/></front>

			<body>H <lb/>igh-quality reference genomes are an indispensable <lb/>resource for basic and applied research in biology, geno-<lb/>mics, agriculture, medicine, and many other fields 1-3 . <lb/>Technological innovations in DNA sequencing, long-range gen-<lb/>otyping, and assembly algorithms have led to rapidly declining <lb/>costs of sequencing and computation for genome assembly pro-<lb/>jects 4 . A major challenge for de novo assembly of genomes of <lb/>outbred, non-model, diploid and polyploid organisms is accurate <lb/>haplotype resolution. Most genome assemblers collapse multiple <lb/>haplotypes into a single consensus sequence to generate a pseudo-<lb/>haploid reference. Unfortunately, this process results in mosaic <lb/>haplotypes with erroneously associated variants not present in <lb/>either haplotype, with concomitant negative impacts on biological <lb/>inference 5-7 . <lb/>Four approaches to haplotype resolution in long-read diploid <lb/>genome assembly have been described. Trio binning uses short-<lb/>read sequence data of the parents to identify parent-specific k-<lb/>mers, which are then used to bin long-read sequence data of the <lb/>offspring into maternal and paternal bins 8-10 . These parent-<lb/>specific read bins can be separately assembled into two haploid <lb/>genomes, as with TrioCanu 9 or binned within the assembly <lb/>graph, as with hifiasm 10 . Trio binning provides accurate phased <lb/>assemblies but requires that samples of the parents are available, <lb/>which is often not possible. A second approach phases reads by <lb/>mapping to an existing reference genome to infer haplotypes, <lb/>followed by long-read partitioning and assembly 11-14 . Read-based <lb/>phasing methods require that a reference assembly is available <lb/>and depends on single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calling, which <lb/>has associated errors. A third approach is to use Strand-seq 15 to <lb/>sequence DNA template strands only, but not the nascent strands <lb/>that have been selectively labeled and targeted for removal. The <lb/>advantage of this method is that structural contiguity of indivi-<lb/>dual homologs is maintained, but it requires living cells and at <lb/>least one cell division with BrdU labeling, and thus is not easily <lb/>scalable for many species or individuals of a species. The fourth <lb/>approach is to separate haplotypes during the genome assembly <lb/>process as implemented by FALCON-Unzip for long reads 16 , <lb/>DipAsm for Hi-C and long reads 17 , and Supernova for short <lb/>reads 18 . The length of the phase blocks produced by these <lb/>methods are, however, limited by sequence read length and depth <lb/>of coverage in the diploid genome. <lb/>To address these issues, we developed FALCON-Phase, an <lb/>assembly processing pipeline that uses the natural intra-<lb/>chromosomal interactions identified by Hi-C to phase paternal <lb/>and maternal contigs and their associated haplotigs from a long-<lb/>read assembly of a diploid organism. A haplotig is an assembled <lb/>sequence from a single haplotype and there are typically several <lb/>haplotigs interspersed along their primary contig (Fig. 1). A <lb/>fundamental limitation of partially phased long-read assemblies is <lb/>that the phase between neighboring haplotigs is unknown. <lb/>FALCON-Phase solves this problem in an efficient fashion, not <lb/>by calling or phasing SNP variants relative to an existing refer-<lb/>ence genome, but by using the ultra-long-range (&gt;1 Mb) infor-<lb/>mation from the mapping of unique, haplotype-specific, Hi-C <lb/>read pairs 19-21 and a stochastic algorithm to establish correct <lb/>linkage between haplotigs along a contigs. <lb/>FALCON-Phase uses a partially phased contig assembly and <lb/>Hi-C data, which can be obtained for many samples, including <lb/>field-collected organisms for which trio samples may not be <lb/>available. We apply our method to PacBio long-read de novo <lb/>genome assemblies of three species with different levels of het-<lb/>erozygosity. Performance of our method is best with high het-<lb/>erozygosity samples: zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and an <lb/>intersubspecies cross of Bos taurus 8,9 (a male fetus, but referred to <lb/>as cow for simplicity), achieving 97% accuracy, whereas the <lb/>lower-heterozygosity human samples have phasing accuracy of <lb/>80-91%. By applying our phasing method to contigs and scaffolds <lb/>in two separate iterations it is possible to extend haplotype <lb/>phasing to chromosomes scale. <lb/>Results <lb/>FALCON-Phase: a Hi-C haplotype-phasing tool for long-read <lb/>assemblies. FALCON-Phase inputs a partially phased long-read <lb/>assembly, such as one from FALCON-Unzip, and extends the <lb/>phasing on the contigs using Hi-C reads from the same sample. <lb/>The method leverages the higher density of cis-interactions for <lb/>Hi-C read pairs to regroup phase blocks (haplotigs) into haplo-<lb/>types along a contig 11 . First, the haplotype phase blocks are <lb/>defined by aligning the alternate haplotigs to their associated <lb/>primary contigs (Fig. 1b). Breaks (minces) in the contigs are <lb/>introduced to separate phased from unphased (collapsed haplo-<lb/>type) regions (Fig. 1c). Hi-C read pair mapping density is then <lb/>used to classify haplotype blocks that are in the same phase (same <lb/>parental homolog) along each contig (Fig. 1d, e). The assembly <lb/>sequences are then expanded by integrating the collapsed <lb/>sequences into both haplotypes to obtain two contig sets that <lb/>contain either maternal or paternal phase blocks interspersed <lb/>with the collapsed regions (Fig. 1f). Although FALCON-Phase <lb/>groups maternal and paternal sequences from the same chro-<lb/>mosomes, it is agnostic as to which parent the assembled chro-<lb/>mosomes came from. Details of the method, including equations <lb/>and algorithms, are described in the methods. <lb/>Over 90% of paternal and maternal contigs correctly phased. <lb/>We tested FALCON-Phase on three vertebrate species for which <lb/>we had trio-binned assemblies from the same data: two human <lb/>samples (HG00733 and mHomSap3), zebra finch, and cow (see <lb/>&quot;Data availability&quot;). In order to most accurately assess the per-<lb/>formance of our method, we removed errors in the starting de <lb/>novo assembly first by breaking chimeric contigs containing <lb/>sequences from different chromosomes for all samples using <lb/>visualization of Hi-C read density with Juicebox 22 . Second, for the <lb/>highest heterozygosity sample, zebra finch, it was also necessary <lb/>to run purge haplotigs 23 to remove haplotype duplications in the <lb/>primary contig set. After this assembly curation, the primary <lb/>contig assemblies ranged from ~1 to 3 Gb in size, matching the <lb/>expected haploid genome size, with contig N50 values from ~3 to <lb/>30 Mb in length and 81-88% of the genomes present in phased <lb/>haplotigs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Average alternate <lb/>haplotig assembly length, which is equivalent to average phase <lb/>block size, ranged from 188 to 452 kb (Table 1). <lb/>In the next stage, Hi-C read pairs were aligned to both the <lb/>collapsed regions and phase blocks using the software BWA-<lb/>MEM 24 . By requiring both Hi-C read pairs to have a map quality <lb/>greater than 10, we obtained a haplotype-specific set of Hi-C <lb/>reads. We found that depending on sample heterozygosity level <lb/>(Table 1), between ~11 and 44% of the Hi-C read pairs contained <lb/>haplotype-specific variants (Supplementary Table 2). A matrix <lb/>was then generated from the counts of retained Hi-C read pairs <lb/>mapping between phase blocks, and the phasing algorithm was <lb/>then applied. We assessed phasing performance of our method by <lb/>counting parental k-mers identified in Illumina sequence data <lb/>from the parents and used a stringent measure that penalized <lb/>every k-mer that was contained within an erroneous phase switch. <lb/>We ran FALCON-Phase on 64 CPUs, with 488GB RAM, and a <lb/>600GB magnetic disk. For the mHomSap3 dataset the total wall <lb/>time was 46 h and the total CPU time was 579 h. The majority of <lb/>time was spent mapping the HiC data (549 CPU hours) and <lb/>running the phasing algorithm (25 CPU hours). <lb/>Before applying FALCON-Phase, ~61-75% of the primary <lb/>contig k-mers and ~95-98% of the haplotig k-mers were <lb/></body>

Emission of pseudohaplotypes with extended-phasing <lb/>Fig. 1 Overview of FALCON-Phase method. a Partially phased long-read assembly consists of primary contigs (blue) and shorter alternate haplotigs (red). <lb/>The region where a haplotig overlaps a primary contig is a phase block and is referred to as being unzipped because two haplotypes are resolved.

			<body>accurately phased into their paternal or maternal haplotypes <lb/>(Fig. 2a, c, e, g and Table 2; see also ref. 25 ). After applying <lb/>FALCON-Phase, the accuracy of the phasing of the new contigs <lb/>was 91-96% for cow, zebra finch, and mHomSap3 (Fig. 2b, d, f, h <lb/>and Table 2). The accuracy for the HG00733 human was lower at <lb/>80.3%, likely due to poor quality Hi-C data (see below for more <lb/>detail). In comparison, trio-binned Canu assemblies have &gt;99% <lb/>parental phasing accuracy for these genomes. We also evaluated <lb/>the phase accuracy of a supernova assembly of the <lb/>HG00733 sample and determined it to be 74% for parental <lb/>haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1). We also applied FALCON-<lb/>Phase to a PacBio HiFi assembly of HG002 and saw similar <lb/>performance to the other humans (Supplementary Table 3). <lb/>The FALCON-Unzip assemblies of the two human samples <lb/>had similar contiguity (primary contig N50 = 22.4 for mHom-<lb/>Sap3 and 26.3 Mb for HG00733), mean phase block length (0.351 <lb/>Mb for mHomSap3 and 0.312 Mb for HG00733), and percent of <lb/>the genome unzipped (81% for mHomSap3 and 84% for <lb/>HG00733; Table 1), although the heterozygosity for mHomSap3 <lb/>is slightly higher than for HG00733 (0.26% versus 0.21%). <lb/>Interestingly, both the absolute number and percentage of long-<lb/>range Hi-C contacts for mHomSap3 are much higher than that of <lb/>HG00733: 12M versus 4.5M Hi-C read pairs have mapping <lb/>distance greater than 100 kb (6.6% versus 3.5% of filtered reads <lb/>have &gt;100 kb mapping distance, Supplementary Table 3 and <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 2). A possible explanation for the poorer Hi-<lb/>C data of HG00733 is that it was collected from a frozen cell line <lb/>whereas the mHomSap3 Hi-C data were collected from <lb/>fresh blood. <lb/>Over 85% of paternal and maternal scaffolds correctly phased. <lb/>One set of the resulting contigs from FALCON-Phase (phase 0) <lb/>was scaffolded into chromosome-scale sequences using Proximo <lb/>Hi-C (Phase Genomics, Table 1 and Fig. 3). A second round of <lb/>phasing was performed on the scaffolds using FALCON-Phase <lb/>and performance was evaluated using parental k-mer counts in <lb/>the unphased versus phased scaffolds (Table 2). We compare the <lb/>phasing accuracy of the scaffolds before running FALCON-Phase <lb/>as a baseline to assess performance for the second round of <lb/>phasing. In the non-human samples, the unphased scaffolds had <lb/>between ~62% (zebra finch) and ~78% (cow) phasing accuracy <lb/>(Table 2); after the second round of FALCON-Phase, accuracy <lb/>increased to ~88% and ~92%, respectively (Table 2). For the <lb/>human samples, unphased scaffolds had ~63% (HG00733) and <lb/>~78% (mHomSap3) phasing accuracy. Phasing performance in <lb/>mHomSap3 was good (85% accuracy), compared to HG00733 <lb/>(74%), which had similarly bad performance for contig phasing <lb/>due to the poor quality of the Hi-C data (see above). It is <lb/>important to note that, unlike trio binning, additional informa-<lb/>tion is necessary to compile the maternal or paternal scaffold sets <lb/>as the phase 0 and phase 1 scaffolds are a mix of maternal and <lb/>paternal scaffolds. Also, sex chromosomes and other hemizygous <lb/>sequence should be treated separately from autosomes. <lb/>To independently verify the parental phasing and structural <lb/>correctness of our human scaffolds, we compared FALCON-<lb/>Phase HG0733 scaffolds to Strand-seq data from the same <lb/>individual. Only a small fraction of total length of FALCON-<lb/>Phase scaffolds genotyped discordantly as homozygous (~0.6%) <lb/>or heterozygous (~1.6%) (Supplementary Fig. 3). There were 10 <lb/>putative misassembles at the contig level, which is a commonly <lb/>observed number for FALCON-or Peregrine-based 26 assemblies <lb/>when compared to Strand-seq data 27 . The scaffolds had a phasing <lb/>switch error rate of 0.78 and a hamming distance of 36% <lb/>(Supplementary Table 4). The hamming distance reported <lb/>correlates well with the 74% phasing accuracy measured by our <lb/>k-mer counting approach for HG00733. Unfortunately, Strand-<lb/>seq data were not available for the samples with high-quality Hi-<lb/>C data so we could not assess them in the same way. <lb/>We also explored the performance of our method in the highly <lb/>heterozygous and repetitive major histocompatibility complex <lb/>(MHC) region in the mHomSap3 dataset. We identified <lb/>haplotype phase blocks using Merqury 28 in the chromosome <lb/>6 scaffold before and after running FALCON-Phase (Supple-<lb/>mentary Fig. 4). Phase blocks were large in the unphased <lb/>scaffolds: two phase blocks spanned the 4 Mb region around the <lb/>MHC with a switch between paternal and maternal haplotype <lb/>near the C4A gene. FALCON-Phase corrected this phase switch, <lb/>and the final sequence contained only a short segment of paternal <lb/>haplotype (50 kb) in an otherwise maternal phase block. This <lb/>phasing error overlaps a putative structural error in our assembly, <lb/>nested in an array of segmental duplications with greater than <lb/>99% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. 4). Additional <lb/>orthogonal data are necessary to resolve the discrepancy between <lb/>our assembly and the hg38 reference. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The ultimate goal of genome assembly is to faithfully represent <lb/>each chromosome in the organism from telomere-to-telomere. To <lb/>do so, assembly methods must account for sequence divergence <lb/>between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes in <lb/>order to prevent collapsed haplotypes and false sequence dupli-<lb/>cations, which may result in incomplete or erroneous repre-<lb/>sentations of the underlying biological sequence 7,9,29 . Long-read <lb/>genome assemblers like FALCON-Unzip identify heterozygous <lb/>regions of a genome as bubbles in assembly graphs and unzip <lb/>those bubbles further by phasing and reassembling reads using <lb/>single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) 16 .

			<body>FALCON-Phase, in conjunction with long-read assembly, is <lb/>thus an attractive method for generating high-quality reference <lb/>genomes of samples for which parents are not available. This <lb/>approach should be useful for large-scale genome initiatives that <lb/>source samples of diverse origins, including invertebrate disease <lb/>vectors, agricultural pests, or threatened or endangered wild-<lb/>caught individuals. The method utilizes two technologies <lb/>common in generating highly contiguous genome assemblies: <lb/>PacBio long reads and Hi-C. While Hi-C is commonly used for <lb/>scaffolding 30,31 , our study finds that similar high-quality data can <lb/>also be used for contig or scaffold phasing. The accuracy of <lb/>phasing increases with Hi-C data quality, specifically the pro-<lb/>portion of long-range contacts greater than 100-kb.

			<body>M reads per Gb of genome size and coverage recommendations <lb/>for PacBio long reads is at least 60-fold coverage and for PacBio <lb/>HiFi reads 30-fold coverage. A feature of FALCON-Phase is that <lb/>it can also be applied to scaffolds in order to link phased scaffold <lb/>regions. Thus, we suggest the following genome assembly work-<lb/>flow: (1) partially phased long-read assembly, (2) FALCON-Phase <lb/>on primary contigs and haplotigs, (3) scaffolding with Hi-C data, <lb/>and (4) FALCON-Phase on scaffolds. <lb/>FALCON-Phase relies on a diploid assembly that is curated as <lb/>a haploid set of primary contigs plus alternate haplotigs that are <lb/>each assigned to a primary contig. Generating a high-quality <lb/>assembly requires the removal of chimeric contigs that join <lb/>unlinked loci 22,31 in the primary assembly using tools, such as <lb/>purge haplotigs 32 , or purge_dups 33 . Any primary contig is treated <lb/>as if it were diploid and will be duplicated in the pseudo-<lb/>haplotype output. Contigs from hemizygous regions of the gen-<lb/>ome, such as the non-pseudoautosomal regions of sex chromo-<lb/>somes and mitochondrial sequences (i.e., haploid), cannot have <lb/>phase-switch errors and should be removed prior to running <lb/>FALCON-Phase or they will be duplicated as an artifact of the <lb/>method. <lb/>The phasing algorithm at the core of FALCON-Phase could be <lb/>adapted to use other long-range contact data types and higher <lb/>ploidies. The input matrix is simply a count of contacts between <lb/>all pairs of sequences in an assembly. Instead of Hi-C data, BAC-<lb/>end sequences, read clouds/linked-reads, or optical maps could be <lb/>transformed into the required input for FALCON-Phase. Hi-C <lb/>was chosen over the other technologies because it provides ultra-<lb/>range contact information (&gt;1 Mb), which enables chromosome-<lb/>scale phase blocks to be created. Similarly, the input sequences <lb/>could consist of phase blocks generated through resequencing and <lb/>variant calling, or pseudo-haplotypes generated from assemblies <lb/>of PacBio HiFi reads or Oxford Nanopore reads (see Supple-<lb/>mentary Table 3 where we apply the method to a PacBio HiFi <lb/>assembly of HG002). The simple approach of skirting variant <lb/>calling reduces the number of steps and overall runtime of <lb/>phasing pseudo-diploid assemblies. There are additional finishing <lb/>steps before the assembly is ready for genome annotation, e.g., <lb/>gap filling with a tool such as PB Jelly 34 . For these reasons, we <lb/>believe FALCON-Phase will be an important algorithmic con-<lb/>tribution to the goal of diploid, high-quality genome assemblies. <lb/>Methods <lb/>FALCON-Phase method. FALCON-Phase has three stages: (1) processing partially <lb/>phased contigs and Hi-C data; (2) application of the phasing algorithm; and (3) <lb/>emission of phased pseudo-haplotypes (Fig. 1). We implemented FALCON-Phase <lb/>using the Snakemake language to provide flexibility and pipeline robustness 35 . The <lb/>pipeline can be run interactively, on a single computer, or submitted to a cluster job <lb/>scheduler. The code is open source under a Clear BSD plus attribution license and <lb/>is available through github (https://github.com/phasegenomics/FALCON-Phase). <lb/>In stage one, the contigs are processed to identify phase blocks: regions of the <lb/>genome that have been unzipped into a maternal and paternal pair of haplotypes. <lb/>For example, FALCON-Unzip generates contiguous primary contigs representing <lb/>pseudo-haplotypes and shorter phased alternate haplotigs. A haplotig placement <lb/>file is generated in the pairwise alignment format 36 that specifies the alignment <lb/>location of each haplotig on the primary contig (Fig. 1). Briefly, haplotigs are <lb/>aligned, filtered, and processed with three utilities of the mummer v4 package: <lb/>nucmer, delta-filter, and show-coords 37 . Sub-alignments for each haplotig are <lb/>chained in one dimension to find the optimal start and end of the placement using <lb/>the coords2hp.py script. Finally, non-unique haplotig mappings and those fully <lb/>contained by other haplotigs are removed with filt_hp.py. <lb/>The haplotig placement file is used to generate three minced FASTA files <lb/>(Fig. 1), A_haplotigs.fasta, B_haplotigs.fasta, and collapsed_haplotypes.fasta. The A <lb/>haplotigs are the original haplotigs (red in Fig. 1), the B haplotigs are the <lb/>corresponding homologous region of the primary contigs (the alternate haplotype, <lb/>blue in Fig. 1c, d), and the collapsed haplotypes are the unphased or collapsed <lb/>regions of the assembly (gray in Fig. 1). The pairing of the A and B minced <lb/>haplotigs in the phase blocks and their order along the primary contig is <lb/>summarized in an index file, ov_index.txt generated by primary_contig_index.pl. <lb/>The Hi-C reads are mapped to the minced contigs using BWA-MEM, with the <lb/>Hi-C option (-5) enabled 24 . The mapped reads are streamed to SAMtools, <lb/>removing unmapped, secondary, and supplementary alignments (SAMtools -F <lb/>2316) 38 . This operation ensures that each mate-pair only contains two alignment <lb/>records. In the last step of read processing, a map quality score filter of Q10 (for <lb/>both reads) is applied, removing reads without haplotype-specific sequence. <lb/>Additionally, we set an edit distance from the reference of less than 5 for both <lb/>reads. Both more stringent (60) and relaxed (0) map quality filtering resulted in <lb/>lower phasing accuracy. <lb/>The Hi-C mate-pair counts between minced contigs are enumerated into a <lb/>contact matrix, M. Each element, M i,j , in the matrix is later normalized by the <lb/>number of Hi-C restriction enzyme sites, z, in both the ith and jth minced contigs <lb/>as shown in Eq. (1). The raw count matrix is encoded into a binary matrix format. <lb/>Mi;j :¼ <lb/>M i;j <lb/>z i þ z j <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>We designed an algorithm to extend phasing between haplotig phase blocks <lb/>based on Hi-C read pair mapping. The algorithm searches for the optimum set of <lb/>phase block configurations along a primary contig using a stochastic model. The <lb/>algorithm is given a list, C, of tuples for the phase blocks and their sequential <lb/>ordering along each primary contig. During initialization, each member of the <lb/>phase block, except the first, is randomly assigned one of the two possible phase <lb/>configurations for a diploid organism ∈({[0, 1],[1, 0]}). The phase assignment is <lb/>stored in array T where 0 corresponds to phase configuration [0, 1]. The first phase <lb/>block along the primary contig is always assigned to the phase configuration [0, 1] <lb/>as its orientation is arbitrary. By fixing the first phase block, the search results are <lb/>comparable across iterations. Phase blocks are only randomly initialized once <lb/>before the search begins. The algorithm sweeps along the phase blocks of each <lb/>primary contig, assigning a phase for the blocks, conditioned on the phase <lb/>assignment of all previous phase blocks and the Hi-C links between them. The <lb/>phaseFreq function (Eq. 2) calculates the frequency of Hi-C links from the current <lb/>region, i, to all past regions, j, that have the same phase, i.e., T i = T j = 1 = [1, 0]. <lb/>phaseFreqði; T; M; CÞ ¼ <lb/>P j&lt;i <lb/>j¼0 γ i; j <lb/>ð Þ*αði; jÞ <lb/>P j&lt;i <lb/>j¼0 βði; jÞ <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>The phaseFreq function takes the index of the current phase block, i, the phase <lb/>assignment of all regions associated with a given primary contig, array T, the <lb/>normalized Hi-C count matrix, M, and the C array of the phase block tuples. The <lb/>gamma function (Eq. 3) determines if two phase blocks have the same phase <lb/>assignment, T, and if so returns 1. The alpha function (Eq. 4) gives the normalized <lb/>cis counts of Hi-C links between a pair of phase blocks whereas the beta function <lb/>(Eq. 5) returns both the cis and trans counts, which is a normalizing constant. <lb/>γ i; j <lb/>ð Þ ¼ <lb/>1; T i <lb/>½ ¼ T½j <lb/>0; T i <lb/>½ ≠ T½j <lb/>&amp; <lb/>ð3Þ <lb/>α i; j; M; C <lb/>À <lb/>Á <lb/>¼ M C i; 0 <lb/>½ ; C j; 1 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>þ M C i; 1 <lb/>½ ; C j; 0 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>ð4Þ <lb/>β i; j; M; C <lb/>À <lb/>Á <lb/>¼ M C i; 0 <lb/>½ ; C j; 0 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>þ M C i; 1 <lb/>½ ; C j; 1 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>þ M C i; 0 <lb/>½ ; C j; 1 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>þ M C i; 1 <lb/>½ ; C j; 0 <lb/>½ <lb/>½ <lb/>ð5Þ <lb/>The process of phase assignment across a primary contig is iterated for a burn-<lb/>in period followed by a scoring period (see Algorithm 1).

The <lb/>order of minced sequences (phase blocks plus collapsed regions) is determined <lb/>by the haplotig placement file and the phase assignment is determined by the <lb/>phasing algorithm. An alternate output similar to the FALCON-Unzip format <lb/>of primary contigs and haplotigs is also available as a user-specified option. <lb/>Users can specify pseudo-haplotype or unzip output formats, the former <lb/>having the same collapsed sequence in both pseudo-haplotypes, the latter <lb/>matching the FALCON-Unzip assembly output format (primary contigs plus <lb/>haplotigs). <lb/>We scaffolded the contigs from FALCON-Phase for the non-human datasets <lb/>using default Proximo 30,39 settings (Phase Genomics, WA). Briefly, reads were <lb/>aligned to phase 0 pseudo-haplotypes using BWA-MEM 40 (v. 0.7.15-r1144-<lb/>dirty) with the -5SP and -t 8 options. SAMBLASTER 41 (commit <lb/>37142b37e4f0026e1b83ca3f1545d1807ef77617) was used to flag PCR duplicates, <lb/>which were later excluded from analysis. Alignments were then filtered with <lb/>SAMtools (v1.5, with htslib 1.5) using the -F 2304 filtering flag to remove non-<lb/>primary and supplementary alignments, as well as read pairs in which one or <lb/>more mates were unmapped. The Phase Genomics Proximo Hi-C genome <lb/>scaffolding platform (commit 145c01be162be85c060c567d576bb4786496c032) <lb/>was used to create chromosome-scale scaffolds from the draft assembly as <lb/>previously described 39 . As in the LACHESIS method 30 , this process computes a <lb/>contact frequency matrix from the aligned Hi-C read pairs, normalized by the <lb/>number of restriction sites on each contig, and constructs scaffolds in such a way <lb/>as to optimize expected contact frequency and other statistical patterns in Hi-C <lb/>data. Juicebox v1.8.8 was used to correct scaffolding errors 22,42 . After <lb/>scaffolding, we applied the phasing algorithm a second time, using as input the <lb/>pairing of the phase 0 and phase 1 pseudo-haplotypes and their order along the <lb/>chromosomes as determined by scaffolding. <lb/>We evaluated FALCON-Phase on three vertebrate species with different levels <lb/>of heterozygosity: The VGP zebra finch female trio (T. guttata, high); the male <lb/>bovine trio (B. taurus taurus × B. taurus indicus moderate); Puerto Rican human <lb/>female trio, (HG00733, low); the VGP admixed human male trio (mHomSap3, <lb/>low). For each genome, we had high-coverage PacBio CLR data for de novo <lb/>genome assembly, Hi-C data for phasing and scaffolding, paired-end Illumina data <lb/>from the parents, and trio-binned Canu assemblies (see &quot;Data availability&quot;). <lb/>Heterozygosity was estimated two ways. First, from k-mers (k-length sequence) <lb/>in Illumina whole-genome sequencing reads (see &quot;Data availability&quot;). Fastq files <lb/>were converted to fasta files, then the canonical k-mers were collected using meryl <lb/>in canu 1.7 (ref. 9 ) to include all the high frequency k-mers using the <lb/>following code. <lb/>meryl -B -C -s $name.fa -m $k_size -o $name.$k <lb/>meryl -Dh -s $name.$k &gt; $name.$k.hist <lb/>Given the k-mer histogram, Genomescope 43 was used to estimate the level of <lb/>heterozygosity. k = 21 was used for HG00733 and cow, and k = 31 was used for the <lb/>zebra finch and mHomSap3. A higher k-mer size was used for zebra finch for more <lb/>accurate estimates of heterozygosity due to its higher level of polymorphism. This <lb/>k-mer size was also used for other samples in the VGP, from which this sample was <lb/>selected. Second, with mummer v 3.2.3 (ref. 44 ), trio-binned parental Canu <lb/>assemblies were aligned with nucmer (nucmer -l 100 -c 500 -maxmatch mom.fasta <lb/>dad.fasta) and heterozygosity was computed as 1-average identity from 1 to 1 <lb/>alignments output by dnadiff using default parameters. <lb/>As a precursor to FALCON-Phase, we performed de novo genome assembly <lb/>with FALCON-Unzip 16 using pb-assembly from pbbioconda (v 0.0.6 for <lb/>mHomSap3, v 0.0.2 for zebra finch and cow) and a binary build from13 August <lb/>2018, for HG00733. <lb/>Zebra finch parameters: (length_cutoff = 13,653; length_cutoff_pr = 5000; <lb/>pa_daligner_option = -e0.76 -l2,000 -k18 -h70 -w8 -s100; ovlp_daligner_option <lb/>= -k24 -h1024 -e.95 -l1800 -s100; pa_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; <lb/>ovlp_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; pa_HPCTANmask_option = -k18 <lb/>-h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; pa_HPCREPmask_option = -k18 -h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; <lb/>pa_DBsplit_option = -x500 -s400; ovlp_DBsplit_option = -s400; <lb/>falcon_sense_option =-output-multi-min-idt 0.70-min-cov 2-max-n-read 400-n-<lb/>core 24; overlap_filtering_setting =-max-diff 100-max-cov 150-min-cov 2-n-<lb/>core 24) <lb/>Cow parameters: (length_cutoff = 14,850; length_cutoff_pr = 12000; <lb/>pa_daligner_option = -e0.76 -l1200 -k18 -h480 -w8 -s100; ovlp_daligner_option <lb/>= -k24 -h480 -e.95 -l1800 -s100; pa_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; <lb/>ovlp_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; pa_HPCTANmask_option = -k18 <lb/>-h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; pa_HPCREPmask_option = -k18 -h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; <lb/>pa_DBsplit_option = -x500 -s400; ovlp_DBsplit_option = -s400; <lb/>falcon_sense_option = -output_multi-min_idt 0.70-min_cov 4-max_n_read <lb/>200-n_core 24; overlap_filtering_setting = -max_diff 120-max_cov 120-min_cov <lb/>4-n_core 24) <lb/>mHomSap3 parameters: (length_cutoff = 20,375; length_cutoff_pr = 10,000; <lb/>pa_daligner_option = -k18 -e0.8 -l1000 -h256 -w8 -s100; ovlp_daligner_option <lb/>= -k24 -e.92 -l1000 -h1024 -s100; pa_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; <lb/>ovlp_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; pa_HPCTANmask_option = -k18 <lb/>-h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; pa_HPCREPmask_option = -k18 -h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; <lb/>pa_DBsplit_option = -x500 -s400; ovlp_DBsplit_option = -s400; <lb/>falcon_sense_option =-output-multi-min-idt 0.70-min-cov 3-max-n-read 100-n-<lb/>core 4; falcon_sense_skip_contained = False; overlap_filtering_setting = -max-diff <lb/>60-max-cov 60-min-cov 2-n-core 12). <lb/>HG00733 parameters: (length_cutoff = 5000; length_cutoff_pr = 10,000; <lb/>pa_daligner_option = -k18 -e0.75 -l1200 -h256 -w8 -s100; ovlp_daligner_option <lb/>= -k24 -e.92 -l1800 -h600 -s100; pa_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; <lb/>ovlp_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24; pa_HPCTANmask_option = -k18 <lb/>-h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; pa_HPCREPmask_option = -k18 -h480 -w8 -e.8 -s100; <lb/>pa_DBsplit_option = -x500 -s400; ovlp_DBsplit_option = -s400; <lb/>falcon_sense_option =-output-multi-min-idt 0.70-min-cov 4-max-n-read 200-n-<lb/>core 8; falcon_sense_skip_contained = False; overlap_filtering_setting =-max-diff <lb/>60-max-cov 60-min-cov 1-n-core 12). <lb/>We identified and corrected chimeric contigs between nonadjacent genomic <lb/>regions in HG00733, mHomSap, and cow assemblies using Juicebox Assembly <lb/>Tools 22 and D-GENIES 45 . We interrogated the concordance of the Hi-C data with <lb/>the PGA scaffolds visually in JBAT. Off-diagonal signals in the heatmap of Hi-C <lb/>read density are indicative of contig/scaffolding errors. Human and cow contigs <lb/>and scaffolds with discordant Hi-C signals were aligned, using minimap2 with the <lb/>-x asm5 setting, to the human or cow reference genomes. If the contig/scaffold in <lb/>question mapped chimerically (inter-or intra-chromosomally) to each genome, <lb/>they were flagged. We manually broke these contigs between phase blocks and <lb/>reassociated the haplotigs to the two new contigs. <lb/>To remove duplicated haplotypes in the primary contigs from the zebra finch <lb/>FALCON-Unzip assembly, as suggested for highly heterozygous genomes from the <lb/>VGP 46 , we ran purge haplotigs 23 on zebra finch using default settings and coverage <lb/>estimates from PacBio subreads mapped to the primary contigs 23 . We <lb/>recategorized 67.1 Mb of primary contigs as haplotigs (N = 632) and 25.4 Mb of <lb/>repetitive sequences (N = 329) were discarded. <lb/>To evaluate phase assignment, parent-specific k-mers were counted in the <lb/>pseudo-haplotypes before and after contig phasing, before and after scaffold <lb/>phasing, and in trio-binned Canu assemblies. Parental k-mers were identified using <lb/>Illumina data from the parents 9 using k = 21. Parental k-mers were counted in the <lb/>assemblies using the simple-dump utility from Canu v1.7. The proportion of <lb/>correct parental k-mers was used as an overall measure of contig or scaffold <lb/>phasing and was plotted for each contig or scaffold in Fig. 2. <lb/>To evaluate the structural contiguity of FALCON-Phase scaffolds we aligned <lb/>available Strand-seq data 47 to the HG00733 scaffolds. We used breakpointR 48 in <lb/>order to detect regions that are consistently genotyped as &quot;HOM&quot; (majority of <lb/>reads in minus direction) or &quot;HET&quot; (mixture of plus and minus reads) across all <lb/>Strand-seq libraries. Regions genotyped as HOM suggest a homozygous inversion <lb/>or misorientation, while regions genotyped as HET points to either a heterozygous <lb/>inversion, chimerism, or collapsed repetitive region. Phasing accuracy was <lb/>evaluated using SNVs detected based on alignments of contig stage assemblies to <lb/>GRCh38 using minimap2 (version 2.17). We evaluate phasing accuracy of our <lb/>assemblies in comparison to trio-based phasing for HG00733 (ref. 47 ). We compare <lb/>only SNV positions that are shared between phased assemblies and those from trio-<lb/>based phasing. Then the switch error rate and Hamming distance were calculated <lb/>as described in Porubsky et al. 49 . <lb/></body>
