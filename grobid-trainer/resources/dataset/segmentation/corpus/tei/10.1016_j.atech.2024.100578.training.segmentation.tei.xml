Current imaging tools struggle to differentiate GISTs from leiomyomas. This study aimed <lb/>to create and assess a real-time artificial intelligence (AI) system using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) images to <lb/>differentiate between GISTs and leiomyomas. <lb/>Methods The AI system underwent development and evaluation using EUS images from 5 endoscopic centers in <lb/>China between January 2020 and August 2023. EUS images of 1101 participants with SELs were retrospectively <lb/>collected for AI system development. A cohort of 241 participants with SELs was recruited for external AI system <lb/>evaluation. Another cohort of 59 participants with SELs was prospectively enrolled to assess the real-time clinical <lb/>application of the AI system. The AI system&apos;s performance was compared to that of endoscopists. This study is <lb/>registered with Chictr.org.cn, Number ChiCT2000035787. <lb/>Findings The AI system displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.921-0.969) for discriminating <lb/>GISTs and leiomyomas. The AI system&apos;s accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and <lb/>negative predictive value (NPV) reached 91.7% (95% CI 87.5%-94.6%), 90.3% (95% CI 83.4%-94.5%), 93.0% (95% <lb/>CI 87.2%-96.3%), 91.9% (95% CI 85.3%-95.7%), and 91.5% (95% CI 85.5%-95.2%), respectively. Moreover, the AI <lb/>system exhibited excellent performance in diagnosing ≤20 mm SELs (ACC 93.5%, 95% CI 0.900-0.969). In a <lb/>prospective real-time clinical application trial, the AI system achieved an AUC of 0.865 (95% CI 0.764-0.966) and <lb/>0.864 (95% CI 0.762-0.966) for GISTs and leiomyomas diagnosis, respectively, markedly surpassing endoscopists <lb/>[AUC 0.698 (95% CI 0.562-0.834) for GISTs and AUC 0.695 (95% CI 0.546-0.825) for leiomyomas]. <lb/>Interpretation We successfully developed a real-time AI-assisted EUS diagnostic system. The incorporation of the <lb/>real-time AI system during EUS examinations can assist endoscopists in rapidly and accurately differentiating <lb/>various types of SELs in clinical practice, facilitating improved diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. <lb/>Funding Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Shanghai Municipality, Science and Technology <lb/>Commission Foundation of the Xuhui District, the Interdisciplinary Program of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and <lb/>the Research Funds of Shanghai Sixth people&apos;s Hospital. <lb/>*Corresponding author. <lb/>**Corresponding author. <lb/>***Corresponding author.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Subepithelial lesions (SELs) are commonly encountered <lb/>in routine gastrointestinal tract screening endoscopy, <lb/>occurring in approximately 0.8-3.1% of patients. 1-3 Most <lb/>SELs, typically measuring &lt;20 mm in diameter, are <lb/>incidentally discovered. 3,4 Gastrointestinal stromal <lb/>tumors (GISTs) are the predominant type of gastroin-<lb/>testinal SELs and are deemed potentially malignant in <lb/>biological behavior. 4,5 Small GISTs, with a diameter <lb/>&lt;2 cm, constitute a subset, and their reported incidence <lb/>ranges from 35% to 40.6%. 6,7 While small GISTs are <lb/>often asymptomatic and clinically benign, those <lb/>displaying high-risk features may manifest malignant <lb/>behaviors such as rapid progression or metastasis. 8,9 <lb/>Consequently, surgical or endoscopic resection, or <lb/>long-term endoscopic monitoring, is recommended. 10,11 <lb/>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) presently stands <lb/>as the most effective imaging modality for SELs evalu-<lb/>ation, relying on echogenic features, shape, origin layer, <lb/>and size. 4,12 However, distinguishing GISTs from other <lb/>SELs, particularly leiomyomas, remains challenging for <lb/>endoscopists due to their similar EUS image features. <lb/>Furthermore, the subjective interpretation of EUS im-<lb/>age features, reliant on endoscopists&apos; experience, results <lb/>in insufficient accuracy for human diagnosis, ranging <lb/>from 45.5% to 66.7%. 13,14 Consequently, histopathology <lb/>remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; for accurate diagnosis. <lb/>Despite the use of EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-<lb/>FNB) or mucosal cutting biopsy for confirmation, <lb/>diagnostic accuracy remains low, especially for small <lb/>SELs. 15,16 Moreover, the invasive nature of these <lb/>procedures, associated risks of bleeding and peritoneal <lb/>seeding, along with varying global availability and <lb/>increased medical expenses, hinder their clinical appli-<lb/>cation. 15,17 Hence, there is an urgent need for a more <lb/>reliable and non-invasive diagnostic method to distin-<lb/>guish GISTs from leiomyomas. <lb/>Recently, AI-based image recognition has shown <lb/>promise in endoscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal <lb/>mucosal lesions and SELs. 18,19 AI-assisted EUS <lb/>diagnostic models have demonstrated promising <lb/>results. 20-23 However, these studies were limited by small <lb/>case numbers, single-institution involvement, retro-<lb/>spective designs, or the absence of real-time application <lb/>in clinical scenarios. <lb/>Therefore, this study aims to develop a real-time <lb/>AI-assisted EUS diagnostic system for distinguishing <lb/>GISTs from leiomyomas and to assess the utility and <lb/>accuracy of the AI system in a clinical setting. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Ethics statement <lb/>The study follows the Standards for Reporting of Diag-<lb/>nostic Accuracy (STARD) reporting guideline and was <lb/>approved by the ethics committees of all participating <lb/>hospitals in China (Shanghai JiaoTong University <lb/>Affiliated Sixth People&apos;s Hospital, Shanghai General <lb/>People&apos;s Hospital, Ruijin Hospital, Huadong Hospital, <lb/>and Shanghai East Hospital) (No. 2020-146, dated <lb/>August 25, 2020). The research adhered to the principles <lb/>outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed <lb/>Research in context <lb/>Evidence before this study <lb/>We conducted a PubMed search up to August 31, 2023, for <lb/>research articles containing the terms of &quot;(artificial <lb/>intelligence OR deep learning OR machine learning OR <lb/>convolutional neural network) AND &quot;(endoscopic OR <lb/>endoscopy)&quot; AND &quot;(ultrasound OR endosonography OR echo-<lb/>endosonography)&quot; AND &quot;(gastrointestinal subepithelial tumor <lb/>OR subepithelial tumor OR subepithelial lesion OR stromal <lb/>tumor OR GIST)&quot;, without any date or language restrictions. <lb/>We found previous studies focused on developing screening <lb/>systems for gastrointestinal SELs using EUS images, but these <lb/>primarily restricted to classifying of lesions or determining the <lb/>malignant potential of GIST. There was no real-time AI-aid <lb/>EUS diagnostic system that could be directly applied in clinical <lb/>setting. <lb/>Added value of this study <lb/>Here, we successfully developed a real-time AI-aid EUS <lb/>diagnostic system, which can automate the identification, <lb/>localization and diagnosis of SELs in clinical setting. To the <lb/>best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the <lb/>application of a real-time AI-aid EUS diagnostic system with <lb/>excellent performance in clinical setting. Inclusion of AI <lb/>system during EUS procedures significantly enhanced the <lb/>diagnostic efficiency, especially for small SELs. <lb/>Implications of all the available evidence <lb/>The incorporation of the real-time AI system during EUS <lb/>examinations can assist endoscopists in rapidly and accurately <lb/>differentiating various types of SELs in clinical practice, <lb/>facilitating improved diagnostic and therapeutic decision-<lb/>making. <lb/></body>

			<body>consent was obtained from all participants for prospec-<lb/>tive clinical trial. Registration for this study was <lb/>completed at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry <lb/>(Registration number: ChiCTR2000035787). <lb/>Participants and study design <lb/>3 cohorts of participants with SELs were collected for <lb/>development and testing (including the AI system <lb/>development cohort, the external evaluation cohort and <lb/>the prospective clinical evaluation cohort) of the AI <lb/>system. The study flowchart is presented in Fig. 1. <lb/>In the AI system development cohort, participants <lb/>with gastrointestinal SELs were retrospectively identi-<lb/>fied from the aforementioned five tertiary hospitals in <lb/>China, spanning January 2013 to December 2020. The <lb/>inclusion criteria for SELs patients were: (1) age be-<lb/>tween 18 and 75 years; (2) prior completion of an EUS <lb/>examination with comprehensive EUS image data; (3) <lb/>availability of complete clinical data. Ultimately, 1101 <lb/>participants with SELs were enrolled, and all pertinent <lb/>medical information was digitally recorded. Among <lb/>these participants, 629 individuals met the inclusion <lb/>criteria, with pathologically confirmed diagnoses of <lb/>GISTs or leiomyomas. They were randomly assigned to <lb/>the training cohort and the internal validation cohort in <lb/>a 7:3 ratio. The training cohort comprised 439 patients <lb/>(1128 EUS images from 212 patients with leiomyomas <lb/>and 1286 EUS images from 227 patients with GISTs). <lb/>The internal validation cohort included 190 patients <lb/>(483 EUS images from 91 leiomyoma cases and 551 <lb/>EUS images from 99 GISTs). Image data from 472 <lb/>participants lacking confirmed pathological diagnoses, <lb/>having pathological diagnoses as other types of SELs, or <lb/>possessing poor EUS images (poor echogenic quality, <lb/>blurred, or artifacts) were used for self-supervised <lb/>learning model training, along with data from 439 <lb/>participants in the training cohort. In total, 5419 EUS <lb/>images from 1101 subjects were utilized for the devel-<lb/>opment of the AI model. <lb/>In the external evaluation cohort, an additional <lb/>cohort of 241 participants with SELs was recruited from <lb/>five centers between January 2021 and December 2022. <lb/>Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 18 <lb/>and 75; (2) complete EUS image data; (3) confirmed <lb/>pathological diagnosis of GISTs or leiomyomas; <lb/>(4) complete clinical data. The exclusion criteria were as <lb/>follows: (1) the clinical data and histopathological data <lb/>are incomplete; (2) poor echogenic quality couldn&apos;t meet <lb/>the data processing requirement. The external evalua-<lb/>tion cohort comprised 1100 EUS images (542 EUS im-<lb/>ages from 113 leiomyoma cases and 558 EUS images <lb/>from 128 GIST cases). This cohort was also utilized to <lb/>compare the performance of the AI model with that of <lb/>endoscopists. Six endoscopists, comprising three senior <lb/>endoscopists (with 5-10 years of experience in EUS) and <lb/>three junior endoscopists (with less than 5 years of <lb/>experience in EUS), independently evaluated EUS im-<lb/>ages from each case within this cohort. They were <lb/>informed that each case was pathologically confirmed to <lb/>have either GIST or leiomyoma, however, they were <lb/>blinded to the information of the pathological results. <lb/>The endoscopists were required to classify each case as <lb/>either GIST or leiomyoma after assessment of all <lb/>anonymized EUS images. Regardless of their expertise, <lb/>all endoscopists was trained using EUS images obtained <lb/>from 10 patients with GIST or leiomyoma not included <lb/>in the study sample. An average method was used to <lb/>combine assessment results within sub-groups with <lb/>different experienced endoscopists in the study. The <lb/>diagnostic results of the AI system and the endoscopists <lb/>were then compared with the final pathological results. <lb/>Furthermore, subgroup analyses by size (≤20 mm and <lb/>Fig. 1: Flow chart depicting the study process.

			<body>&gt;20 mm) or pathological type (GISTs and leiomyomas) <lb/>were conducted to investigate the performance of the AI <lb/>system in the external evaluation cohort. <lb/>Data preprocessing <lb/>The EUS images collected for AI model development <lb/>underwent meticulous selection and review by two <lb/>expert endoscopists. Representative images for each <lb/>patient were chosen, and all EUS images were retrieved <lb/>in JPEG format. Identical information, including patient <lb/>identity, number, name, and acquisition time, was <lb/>cropped out from the EUS images. The region of in-<lb/>terest (ROI) containing a GIST or leiomyoma in the <lb/>training dataset was manually delineated using Labelme <lb/>software (version 4.2.10, https://github.com/wkentaro/ <lb/>labelme) and saved as a JSON file. Annotation was <lb/>performed independently by each expert, and consensus <lb/>was reached. All labeled lesion images were resized to <lb/>256 × 256 pixels before AI model training. To enhance <lb/>the diversity of training data and improve the model&apos;s <lb/>generalization ability, while minimizing the risk of <lb/>overfitting, image augmentation techniques were <lb/>applied. These techniques included flipping, rotation <lb/>(random rotation between 0 and 60 • for each image), <lb/>and random cropping (cropping size of 224 × 224 <lb/>pixels). To mitigate the impact of image data from <lb/>different ultrasound endoscopes and probes at various <lb/>centers on AI model development, the image data from <lb/>different centers were randomly divided into the <lb/>training cohort and internal validation cohort in a 7:3 <lb/>ratio for AI model development. <lb/>AI system development <lb/>The comprehensive development process of the AI <lb/>system is illustrated in Fig. 2. Briefly, a two-stage <lb/>training approach was employed to fully leverage the <lb/>potential semantic information in the EUS images (see <lb/>Supplementary Figure S1). In the first stage, a self-<lb/>supervised learning approach was utilized. In the sec-<lb/>ond stage, input images underwent a region of interest <lb/>(ROI) detection model, FROI (⋅), to identify the tumor <lb/>ROI. The feature encoder Fe (⋅) replicated the parame-<lb/>ters of Ge (⋅) from the first stage and, combined with a <lb/>fully connected layer classifier (Classifier), performed a <lb/>binary classification task. Through this two-stage <lb/>training approach, a deep learning model capable of <lb/>accurately extracting and predicting tumor information <lb/>based on EUS images was successfully established. <lb/>During the development of the AI system, given the <lb/>potential diagnostic correlations among multiple images <lb/>from the same patient, we employed a voting mecha-<lb/>nism to consolidate the AI analysis results of these <lb/>images. Specifically, multiple consecutive endoscopic <lb/>images from the same patient (patient-level assessment) <lb/>were integrated to obtain the AI analysis results. If the <lb/>majority of images from a patient are categorized as a <lb/>specific lesion, then the patient is diagnosed with that <lb/>lesion. Specific details regarding the development of the <lb/>AI system are outlined in Supplementary Materials. <lb/>Prospective clinical application evaluation <lb/>To further assess the diagnostic performance of the AI <lb/>system in clinical application, a prospective clinical <lb/>evaluation was conducted at Shanghai JiaoTong Uni-<lb/>versity School of Medicine Affiliated Sixth People&apos;s <lb/>Hospital from January 2023 to August 2023. Inclusion <lb/>criteria were as follows: (1) age between 18 and 75; (2) <lb/>endoscopists identified subepithelial lesions as potential <lb/>GISTs or leiomyomas during EUS examination; (3) pa-<lb/>tients consented to endoscopic resection and were <lb/>Fig. 2: Comprehensive overview of the AI system model development.

			<body>followed up until a definitive pathological diagnosis was <lb/>obtained. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pa-<lb/>tients who underwent upper gastrointestinal emergency <lb/>examination or treatment for symptoms such as hema-<lb/>temesis or abdominal pain; (2) pregnant or lactating <lb/>individuals; (3) potential participants with gastrointes-<lb/>tinal submucosal bulges that were determined to be <lb/>normal vessels, organ oppression, or extra-<lb/>gastrointestinal lesions. During the application evalua-<lb/>tion, a separate monitor with the AI system was installed <lb/>adjacent to the original EUS monitor. The AI system <lb/>was linked to the endoscopy generator, and the video <lb/>stream was captured synchronously. If the SEL was <lb/>suspected to be a GIST or leiomyoma during EUS ex-<lb/>amination, the endoscopists were required to classify it <lb/>as one of the two types. Herein, two endoscopists with <lb/>over 5 years of experience in EUS participated in the <lb/>prospective evaluation. In cases of disagreement, a <lb/>consensus was reached through discussion with a third <lb/>reviewer who had over 10 years of experience in EUS. <lb/>Subsequently, the AI system was turned on and applied, <lb/>the system processed each frame and displayed the <lb/>location of the detected SELs with a rectangular tracing <lb/>box on monitor and provided a tumor type with diag-<lb/>nostic confidence. Concurrently, an independent data <lb/>collector recorded the diagnostic data from the endo-<lb/>scopists and AI system. The AI system conducted real-<lb/>time video analysis at a minimum of 30 frames per <lb/>second (30fps), with the detection delay being barely <lb/>noticeable for the endoscopists. <lb/>Sample size estimation <lb/>The sample size for the prospective clinical application <lb/>evaluation was determined using Tests for Two ROC <lb/>Curves by the NCSS PASS software (version 15.0). <lb/>Based on previous research indicating that the AUC for <lb/>the diagnostic yield for SELs of EUS-AI and EUS experts <lb/>was 0.861-0.965 and 0.684-0.739, respectively. 24 The <lb/>AUC of the AI system and endoscopists in this study <lb/>was estimated to be 0.900 and 0.650, respectively. The <lb/>sample size of 29 patients in each trial group would be <lb/>needed for the primary outcome based on an alpha level <lb/>of 0.05, power of 0.9, and 15% dropout rate. In the end, <lb/>a total of 59 patients with potential GISTs or leiomyo-<lb/>mas, as identified by endoscopists, were enrolled. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 <lb/>(IBM, CA, USA) and R software (version 4.1.3). Nor-<lb/>mally distributed continuous variables were presented <lb/>as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while non-normally <lb/>distributed variables were expressed as median and <lb/>range. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Q-Q plots were <lb/>used to evaluate and check normality. One-way ANOVA <lb/>was used for comparing continuous variables that <lb/>adhere to a normal distribution, while the Kruskal-<lb/>Wallis test was employed for comparing continuous <lb/>variables that do not conform to a normal distribution, <lb/>and categorical variables were compared using the Chi-<lb/>square test or Fisher&apos;s exact test. The Wilson method <lb/>was employed to calculate 95% confidence intervals <lb/>(95% CI). The performance of the AI system was <lb/>assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, <lb/>and NPV. The overall performance was evaluated <lb/>through the ROC curves and AUC. DeLong&apos;s test was <lb/>utilized to compare differences in ROC curves. Cali-<lb/>bration curves were generated to evaluate diagnostic <lb/>performance in both the model development and in-<lb/>ternal validation cohorts. Decision curve analysis (DCA) <lb/>was conducted to assess the clinical utility of the model. <lb/>Interobserver agreement of the endoscopists was <lb/>assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). <lb/>ICC values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indi-<lb/>cating higher consistency; generally, ICC ≥0.75 in-<lb/>dicates good consistency and ICC &lt;0.4 indicates poor <lb/>consistency. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a <lb/>two-tailed significance level of 0.05 was considered. <lb/>Role of the funding source <lb/>The funder of the study had no role in study design, data <lb/>collection and analysis, data interpretation, preparation <lb/>of the manuscript, or decision to publish. <lb/>Results <lb/>Clinical characteristics of participants <lb/>A total of 870 participants [mean (Standard Deviation, <lb/>SD) age, 55.5 (11.3) years; 505 females (58.0%)] with <lb/>pathologically confirmed diagnosis of GISTs or leio-<lb/>myomas were included in the AI system training and <lb/>evaluation cohort. GISTs (n = 454) and leiomyomas <lb/>(n = 416) accounted for 52.2% and 47.8%, respectively. <lb/>84.7% of GISTs and leiomyomas had a size ≤20 mm. <lb/>The majority of SELs were located in the stomach. The <lb/>training cohort consisted of 439 participants, with 261 <lb/>(59.5%) being female. The mean (SD) age for this cohort <lb/>was 55.7 (11.1) years. The internal validation cohort <lb/>included 190 participants (53.2% female) with a mean <lb/>(SD) age of 54.9 (11.0) years. The external evaluation <lb/>cohort comprised 241 participants (59.3% female) with a <lb/>mean (SD) age of 55.9 (11.9) years. Additionally, the <lb/>prospective clinical application cohort included 59 par-<lb/>ticipants (61% female) with a mean (SD) age of 59 (10.5) <lb/>years. Detailed information of sample distribution <lb/>within each cohort is shown in Table 1. No significant <lb/>differences were noted in age, sex, tumor location, tu-<lb/>mor size on EUS images, and pathological type among <lb/>the training cohort, internal validation cohort and the <lb/>external evaluation cohort. <lb/>The performance of AI system in the internal <lb/>validation and external evaluation cohort <lb/>The overall diagnostic performance of the AI system <lb/>was assessed in both the internal validation and external <lb/></body>

			<body>evaluation cohorts. In the internal validation cohort, the <lb/>AI system accurately diagnosed 177 out of 190 tumors, <lb/>achieving an accuracy of 93.1% (95% CI, 88.6%-96.0%). <lb/>The AUC of the AI system was 0.949 (95% CI: <lb/>0.918-0.973). Calibration curves demonstrated that <lb/>the model was well-calibrated (see Supplementary <lb/>Figure S3). Additionally, Decision Curve Analysis <lb/>(DCA) indicated the added benefits of using the AI <lb/>system (Supplementary Figure S4). In the external <lb/>evaluation cohort, the AI system correctly diagnosed 221 <lb/>out of 241 tumors, resulting in an accuracy of 91.7% <lb/>(95% CI, 87.5%-94.6%). The AI system showed sensi-<lb/>tivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.3% (83.4%-<lb/>94.5%), 93.0% (87.2%-96.3%), 91.9% (85.3%-95.7%), <lb/>and 91.5% (85.5%-95.2%), respectively. The AUC of the <lb/>AI system in the external evaluation cohort was 0.948 <lb/>(95% CI: 0.921-0.969) (see Table 2). The ROC curves for <lb/>the internal validation and external evaluation cohorts <lb/>are depicted in Fig. 3. <lb/>Comparison on the performance between AI <lb/>systems and endoscopists <lb/>To assess diagnostic performance, three senior and <lb/>three junior endoscopists, who were not involved in the <lb/>AI model development, analyzed 1100 EUS images <lb/>from 241 cases in the external evaluation cohort. The <lb/>accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC of <lb/>each endoscopist for the diagnosis of SELs are shown in <lb/>Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S5. <lb/>In addition, the confusion matrix for the per-category <lb/>diagnostic performance of the AI system and endo-<lb/>scopists is also shown in Supplementary Table S1. All <lb/>endoscopists showed a diagnostic ability of less <lb/>than 0.75 for distinguishing GISTs from leiomyomas <lb/>(accuracy range, 67.2%-74.3%).

			<body>the diagnostic accuracies for leiomyomas and GISTs <lb/>(P = 0.448). <lb/>The application assessment of AI system in a <lb/>prospective cohort <lb/>Following evaluation in an external cohort, the AI model <lb/>was transformed into a real-time application system for <lb/>use during EUS procedures, named the AI-aid EUS <lb/>diagnostic system (Supplementary Figure S6). The <lb/>diagnostic performance of the AI-aid EUS diagnostic <lb/>system was assessed in a prospective cohort of 59 <lb/>patients. SELs identified as potential GISTs or leio-<lb/>myomas by endoscopists during EUS procedures were <lb/>further diagnosed by the AI-aid EUS diagnostic system. <lb/>The diagnostic results of the AI-aid EUS diagnostic <lb/>system and endoscopists were then compared with the <lb/>final histopathological results. Results indicated that the <lb/>AI-aid EUS diagnostic system exhibited excellent <lb/>discrimination between GISTs (AUC: 0.865, 95% CI: <lb/>0.782-0.977) and leiomyomas (AUC: 0.864, 95% CI <lb/>0.762-0.966) (Fig. 5). The corresponding accuracy, <lb/>sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the AI system <lb/>for GISTs were 86.5%, 89.7%, 83.3%, 83.9%, and <lb/>89.3%, respectively. In contrast, the AUC of the endo-<lb/>scopist was only 0.698 (95% CI 0.562-0.834). The <lb/>DeLong test revealed that the diagnostic efficiency of the <lb/>AI system was significantly superior to that of the <lb/>endoscopist (P = 0.010). Similar results were found in <lb/>the diagnosis of the AI system for leiomyomas. The <lb/>diagnostic confidence of the AI system (Supplementary <lb/>Figure S7) for GISTs and leiomyomas, along with the <lb/>real-time application video in a clinical setting (video 1), <lb/>can be found in the supplementary information. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>GISTs and leiomyomas are the most prevalent SELs in <lb/>the gastrointestinal tract, with an increasing incidence. <lb/>However, no definitively specific imaging features exist <lb/>to reliably differentiate GISTs from leiomyomas. <lb/>Despite improvements in diagnostic yield through tis-<lb/>sue acquisition methods like EUS-FNB or mucosal <lb/>cutting biopsy, variations in endoscopists&apos; experience in <lb/>EUS image interpretation and procedural techniques <lb/>limit diagnostic accuracy. 10,11,25 Recently, AI has been <lb/>widely applied to the field of digestive endoscopy and <lb/>demonstrated promising performance. 26,27 Previous <lb/>studies have highlighted the effectiveness of AI in <lb/>diagnosing SELs: Hirai et al. 18 developed an AI system <lb/>for multi-category classifications by retrospective anal-<lb/>ysis of 631 SELs, the accuracy of the AI system for <lb/>differentiating SELs achieved 86.1%. Yoon et al. 28 <lb/>established a convolutional neural network computer-<lb/>aided diagnosis system based on 212 EUS images, the <lb/>diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing GISTs was <lb/>79.2%. However, the limited case numbers, retrospec-<lb/>tive designs and the absence of prospective external <lb/>evaluation were the common drawbacks in these <lb/>studies. Yang et al. 20 have published a prospective study <lb/>on an AI-assisted EUS system for distinguishing GIST <lb/>from leiomyomas, while the AUC of their AI system <lb/>was only 0.642 in the external testing set. Cai MY et al. 29 <lb/>established an automatically optimized radiomics <lb/>modeling system for small SELs based on 383 SELs, <lb/>while the accuracy for identifying GISTs was only <lb/>74.2%. The poor performance may hinder the practical <lb/>implementation of these AI models in clinical settings. <lb/>Compared with these previous studies, the current <lb/>study had several notable novelties. First, a multicenter <lb/>dataset comprising of 1401 patients in the current study <lb/>were employed to develop the AI-assisted EUS diag-<lb/>nostic system, to our understanding, which is the largest <lb/>dataset reported in this field. Second, the AI system was <lb/>successfully implemented in real-time during clinical <lb/>practice and evaluated in a prospective cohort, to the <lb/>best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting <lb/>5: Real-time application assessment of the AI system in a prospective clinical cohort. Performance metrics (including AUC, ACC, SE, SP, PPV, <lb/>NPV) in diagnosing GISTs and leiomyomas evaluated in a prospective clinical cohort.

			<body>the application of a real-time AI-aid EUS diagnostic <lb/>system in a prospective clinical trial. Third, the AI sys-<lb/>tem demonstrated superior performance in both inter-<lb/>nal and external evaluation cohorts as well as in clinical <lb/>practice. <lb/>In the current study, the AI system demonstrated an <lb/>accuracy of 93.1%, sensitivity of 94.4%, and specificity of <lb/>93.0% in distinguishing GISTs from leiomyomas in the <lb/>internal validation cohort. When the AI system was <lb/>evaluated in an external evaluation cohort, it achieved an <lb/>accuracy of 91.7%, sensitivity of 90.3%, and specificity of <lb/>93.0%, surpassing the performance of previous <lb/>studies. 18,20,23,29 Consistent with these studies, 18,20,23,29 the <lb/>diagnostic efficiency of the AI system (ACC 91.7%) was <lb/>significantly superior to that of endoscopists (67.2%-<lb/>74.3%) in distinguishing GISTs from leiomyomas. <lb/>It is noteworthy that the majority of SELs are small in <lb/>size, with this study revealing that over 80% of SELs <lb/>were ≤20 mm. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EUS <lb/>in discriminating small SELs remains suboptimal. Even <lb/>with the addition of tissue diagnosis, the reported <lb/>diagnostic yield for small SELs ranges only from 62% to <lb/>82%. 30,31 Moreover, there is a significant discrepancy in <lb/>guidelines regarding the optimal management strategy <lb/>for small SELs. The American College of Gastroenter-<lb/>ology (ACG) recommends endoscopic follow-up for <lb/>small GISTs, 32 while Asian guidelines and the European <lb/>Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) prefer endoscopic <lb/>resection. 11,33 In contrast, the European Society of <lb/>Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) suggests limiting <lb/>endoscopic resection to patients with pathologically <lb/>confirmed GIST. 34 The lack of consensus on manage-<lb/>ment and the absence of effective diagnostic methods <lb/>posed a challenge for endoscopists when encountering <lb/>&lt;20 mm SELs. Previous studies have reported that EUS-<lb/>based AI models have higher diagnostic accuracy for <lb/>larger SELs (93.3-96.3% for SELs ≥20 mm). 18,20 In this <lb/>study, it is encouraging that the AI system demonstrated <lb/>better diagnostic performance for small SELs (93.5% for <lb/>SELs ≤20 mm, 83.3% for SELs &gt;20 mm). Cai MY et al. <lb/>established an automatically optimized radiomics <lb/>modeling system for small SELs based on 383 SELs with <lb/>&lt;20 mm in size; however, the accuracy for identifying <lb/>GISTs was only 74.2%, 29 significantly lower than the <lb/>performance of the AI system in this study. Possible <lb/>reasons include: 1) the larger sample size of small SELs <lb/>(≤20 mm) in the present study; 2) the EUS images of <lb/>small SELs exhibit relatively well-defined boundaries <lb/>and higher contrast with normal tissues than those of <lb/>large SELs. <lb/>In the prospective evaluation cohort, the AI system <lb/>exhibited favorable performance in discriminating be-<lb/>tween GISTs and leiomyomas. The real-time application <lb/>of the AI system suggests its potential in mitigating <lb/>disparities in diagnostic proficiency across various re-<lb/>gions, particularly benefiting patients in medically un-<lb/>derserved areas and contributing to the scientific <lb/>diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal SELs. <lb/>Moreover, the AI system is intended to serve as an <lb/>assisting decision-making system. Drawing from results <lb/>in the prospective evaluation cohort, the real-time AI-<lb/>assisted system have the potential to improve the diag-<lb/>nostic accuracy even for experienced endoscopists and <lb/>would therefore, change the treatment decisions. In the <lb/>future, we anticipate that the utilization of AI system <lb/>can significantly enhance the capabilities of endo-<lb/>scopists in EUS procedures. This will be especially <lb/>valuable for endoscopists with lower procedural vol-<lb/>umes to help reduce their variability and maintain high <lb/>standards of EUS evaluation for patients. In terms of <lb/>training, experienced endoscopists may have more <lb/>confident in allowing trainee endoscopists to perform <lb/>EUS examination on their behalf under direct or over-<lb/>sight supervision. For trainees, having the opportunity <lb/>to perform more endoscopic examinations could also <lb/>potentially hasten their path to proficiency and expedite <lb/>their advancement towards competence. <lb/>Despite the promising performance demonstrated by <lb/>the AI system, certain limitations should be acknowl-<lb/>edged. Firstly, the AI system was exclusively employed <lb/>for the binary classification of GISTs and leiomyomas, <lb/>requiring the involvement of experienced endoscopists <lb/>during its utilization. Attempts were made to incorpo-<lb/>rate other types of SELs into the development of the AI <lb/>system. However, due to their low prevalence and the <lb/>risk of overfitting without sufficient data, a dependable <lb/>model for the multi-classification of SELs could not be <lb/>trained. Addressing these challenges necessitates larger-<lb/>scale multicenter or international studies. Secondly, the <lb/>real-time evaluation of the AI system was conducted <lb/>solely at one center with a limited sample size. There-<lb/>fore, a prospective study involving multiple centers with <lb/>a more extensive sample size is required to further <lb/>validate the real-time diagnostic efficiency of the AI <lb/>system. Thirdly, although we have endeavored to ensure <lb/>the representativeness of the cohorts and the univer-<lb/>sality of the research findings in this study. It is possible <lb/>that they may not fully encompass all possible clinical <lb/>scenarios and patient characteristics, Future studies will <lb/>further seek to broaden the diversity of samples and <lb/>enhance the representativeness of cohorts to strengthen <lb/>the universality of research conclusions. Furthermore, <lb/>the present study focused on the real-time diagnostic <lb/>efficiency of the AI system. However, it is also impor-<lb/>tant to assess its impact on clinical outcomes, such as <lb/>patient management decisions, treatment strategies, <lb/>and long-term prognosis. Future research could involve <lb/>prospective studies to assess the clinical usefulness and <lb/>cost-effectiveness of integrating the AI system into <lb/>routine practice. Lastly, the interpretability of the AI <lb/>system&apos;s decisions remains a challenge. Despite its <lb/>excellent performance, the ability to provide explana-<lb/>tions for its diagnoses would greatly enhance trust and <lb/>acceptance among healthcare providers.

This novel tool could provide a relatively <lb/>accurate, convenient, and noninvasive method, serving <lb/>to assist endoscopists in real-time differentiation of <lb/>various types of SELs in clinical practice and facilitating <lb/>improved diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. <lb/></body>
