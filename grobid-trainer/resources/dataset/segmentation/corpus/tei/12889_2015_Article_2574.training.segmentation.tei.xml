Depledge 2 <lb/> Abstract <lb/> Background: The global disease burden resulting from climate change is likely to be substantial and will <lb/>put further strain on public health systems that are already struggling to cope with demand. An up-stream <lb/>solution, that of preventing climate change and associated adverse health effects, is a promising approach, <lb/>which would create win-win-situations where both the environment and human health benefit. One such <lb/>solution would be to apply methods of behaviour change to prompt pro-environmentalism, which in turn <lb/>benefits health and wellbeing. <lb/> Discussion: Based on evidence from the behavioural sciences, we suggest that, like many social behaviours, <lb/>pro-environmental behaviour can be automatically induced by internal or external stimuli. A potential trigger <lb/>for such automatic pro-environmental behaviour would be natural environments themselves. <lb/>Previous research has demonstrated that natural environments evoke specific psychological and physiological <lb/>reactions, as demonstrated by self-reports, epidemiological studies, brain imaging techniques, and various <lb/>biomarkers. This suggests that exposure to natural environments could have automatic behavioural effects, <lb/>potentially in a pro-environmental direction, mediated by physiological reactions. <lb/>Providing access and fostering exposure to natural environments could then serve as a public health tool, together with <lb/>other measures, by mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable health in sustainable ecosystems. However, <lb/>before such actions are implemented basic research is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved, and applied <lb/>investigations are needed to explore real world impacts and effect magnitudes. As environmental research is still not <lb/>sufficiently integrated within medical or public health studies there is an urgent need to promote interdisciplinary <lb/>methods and investigations in this critical field. <lb/> Summary: Health risks posed by anthropogenic climate change are large, unevenly distributed, and unpredictable. <lb/>To ameliorate negative impacts, pro-environmental behaviours should be fostered. Potentially this could be achieved <lb/>automatically through exposure to favourable natural environments, with an opportunity for cost-efficient nature-based <lb/>solutions that provide benefits for both the environment and public health. <lb/> Keywords: Pro-environmentalism, Automatic mind, Neuro-psychology, Anthropogenic, Behaviour change, Nature-based <lb/>solutions, Ecosystem degradation, Nudging, Climate change <lb/></front>

			<body> Background <lb/> We are in urgent need of finding methods for protecting <lb/>public health from the negative effects of climate change. <lb/>A wide range of approaches will be needed to face the <lb/>many levels of health effects. Basically, the methods can <lb/>be of a mitigating character, i.e. acting on factors that <lb/>cause climate change in the first place such as reducing <lb/>greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or adaptive, i.e. various <lb/>ways to protect health of already present climate change <lb/>effects, like establishing early heat wave alarm systems. <lb/>Both approaches are necessary, but mitigating methods <lb/>hold a promise to contribute to broader health benefits as <lb/>it prevents the threat rather than treating the effects once <lb/>harm is already done. This is at the core of public health <lb/>work. In addition, this creates co-benefit situations, that is <lb/>both beneficial to environment and public health. As <lb/>human behaviour is the cause of climate change a logical <lb/>approach to mitigation would be to change human behav-<lb/>iour into manners where environmental concerns are <lb/>included in our actions. <lb/></body>

			<body> This paper will discuss why it is a major task for public <lb/>health to tackle climate change and how behavioural <lb/>change may potentially be induced to act as a mitigation <lb/>tool. We suggest that exposure to nature may induce be-<lb/>havioural change. By drawing on research on humans&apos; <lb/>reactions to nature as well as neuroscience for under-<lb/>standing biological fundaments of behaviour, the paper <lb/>wants to draw attention to this area and how further <lb/>investigation into the topic could spur research, policies, <lb/>and actions resulting in improved environmental condi-<lb/>tions and public health. <lb/> Healthy planet, healthy people <lb/> Climate change is now recognised as one of today&apos;s domin-<lb/>ating threats to human health [1]. Alterations in infectious, <lb/>parasitic and zoonotic diseases, heat-and cold related mor-<lb/>tality, and consequences of extreme events provide overt <lb/>examples of expected health impacts [2, 3]. Insidious, <lb/>chronic effects of climate change are less well recognised, <lb/>but may be very significant and will most probably increase <lb/>over time. Such include for example secondary impacts, <lb/>like impaired fresh water flow, and tertiary impacts, like <lb/>health risks associated to escalating resource conflicts [4]. <lb/>The latest report from the World Health Organization <lb/>(WHO) concludes that climate change is expected to <lb/>cause approximately 250 000 additional, unequally dis-<lb/>tributed deaths annually between 2030 and 2050 [5]. <lb/>Yet, these figures probably represent underestimations <lb/>as longer term secondary and tertiary impacts are not <lb/>accounted for. <lb/> The health sector and the public are waking up at last <lb/> Climate change has, by convention, been considered a <lb/>topic to be dealt with by ecologists and other environ-<lb/>mentally related disciplines, and has been underesti-<lb/>mated as a serious health issue. The awareness among <lb/>both health professionals and the public has conse-<lb/>quently been insufficient. The direct link to human be-<lb/>haviour has neither been acknowledged. This has <lb/>resulted in insufficient investments in preparing for cli-<lb/>mate change impacts on health and an unawareness of <lb/>the urgent necessity of interactive collaborations be-<lb/>tween the environmental, behavioural and health sector. <lb/>However, as immediate health consequences of climate <lb/>change are now emerging the topic is gaining increased <lb/>attention amidst the health sector and in policies [1]. A <lb/>few studies have also investigated the knowledge of <lb/>health impact of climate change among the general pub-<lb/>lic, showing that although awareness of health impacts <lb/>exist the salience is lacking [6]. This demonstrates the <lb/>value of communicating the health risks that our unsus-<lb/>tainable behaviour results in and it has been called for <lb/>reframing climate change as a public health issue for a <lb/>better understanding of our dependence on healthy eco-<lb/>systems [7–9]. <lb/> More must be done and novel ideas must be explored <lb/> Studies and reports from medicine and public health are <lb/>increasingly addressing the issue of health impacts from cli-<lb/>mate change [1, 2, 10–12]. However, much more research <lb/>is needed, particularly in low-income countries, often the <lb/>most vulnerable to health effects of climate change [4]. <lb/>Environmental threats do not fall into individual risk <lb/>factor categories (in the way that tobacco consumption <lb/>can be readily studied by, for example, epidemiological <lb/>methods) but are inherently more complex and elude <lb/>causality studies and efficient interventions at individual <lb/>or family levels. In spite of some efforts of interdisciplinary <lb/>research projects, we do not yet have sufficient knowledge <lb/>to predict which interventions are most appropriate for <lb/>particular environmental threats. This obstructs the devel-<lb/>opment of efficient policies and actions for facing and <lb/>managing current and future environmental challenges in <lb/>the public health sector. <lb/>Many of today&apos;s health care approaches regarding the <lb/>health impacts of climate change are of a downstream <lb/>character, based on preparing for what to do when extreme <lb/>events occur, rather than working upstream to hold disas-<lb/>ters at bay. An upstream approach by the health sector to <lb/>reducing climate change would involve mitigating strat-<lb/>egies with possibly much larger and cost-efficient health <lb/>and environmental benefits. <lb/>Engineering and economic system changes for reducing <lb/>GHG emissions and revert the rapid speed of climate <lb/>change are promising, but insufficient to meet the climate <lb/>stabilisation targets of the Sustainable Development Goals <lb/>(SDGs). Individual and household behaviour changes are <lb/>also necessary and this is an area for the health sector to <lb/>urgently start exploring and implying. Dietz et al. [13] <lb/>showed that environmentally aware household actions <lb/>could substantially reduce carbon emissions, with little or <lb/>no impact on general wellbeing. <lb/>In a recent editorial on climate change and human sur-<lb/>vival in the British Medical Journal, McCoy et al. write that <lb/>health professionals  &quot; should each use whatever influence <lb/>we have to change the minds and behaviour of others &quot; <lb/>[14]. This is an ethical call for the health sector to adopt a <lb/>novel model for achieving sustainable health, and resisting <lb/>and mitigating the severe consequences of climate change. <lb/>We must learn how to adopt such a model and what eth-<lb/>ical tools to use for changing  &quot; the minds and behaviour of <lb/>others &quot; , and not the least ourselves. <lb/> What is the desired behaviour? <lb/> Pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) is a behaviour that can <lb/>have major impact on preserving ecosystems and mitigat-<lb/>ing climate change [13]. It can be defined as the propensity <lb/></body>

			<body> to take actions and decisions with pro-environmental im-<lb/>pact and is commonly understood to be a consequence of <lb/>attitudes and concerns related to ecosystem destruction, <lb/>climate change, and other adverse ecological impacts of <lb/>human activity [15]. PEB is exemplified by behaviours such <lb/>as decreased use of motorised transport, adopting of <lb/>recycling, choosing environmentally labelled products, or <lb/>changing eating habits to more vegetarian food. It can be <lb/>measured using, for instance, the General Ecological <lb/>Behaviour (GEB) scale, a reliable and validated measure <lb/>determining the function of environmental values and <lb/>intentions, and responsibility feelings [16]. <lb/>Incorporating efforts towards PEB into public health <lb/>research and actions, and also explore how such behav-<lb/>iours may be induced, would be one way to reply to the <lb/>call for health professionals to change human behaviour <lb/>and actively embrace climate change as part of the med-<lb/>ical curriculum. <lb/> How can behaviour be changed? <lb/> Behaviour change for the environment has been <lb/>approached on a societal level through, for example, <lb/>provision of information, policies, legislations, or en-<lb/>forcements, often with limited success in terms of de-<lb/>sired behavioural outcomes and particularly sustained <lb/>behaviour change is rarely achieved [17]. Although <lb/>public awareness about climate change is relatively high <lb/>the behavioural response is small, referred to as the so <lb/>called  &quot; attitude-behaviour &quot;  or  &quot; value-action &quot;  gap [18]. <lb/>Theories, with more or less empirical support, con-<lb/>cerning factors that influence PEB, include the Theory of <lb/>Planned Behaviour [19], the Value-Belief-Norm [20], and <lb/>the Theory of Normative Conduct [21]. In research on <lb/>motivational factors, concepts like  &quot; warm glow &quot; or <lb/> &quot; helper&apos;s high &quot; [22, 23] have been suggested, which link <lb/>evolutionary adaptive traits of humans (by doing good to <lb/>others your chance for survival increases and is therefore <lb/>an inherited quality) to biological development, as the <lb/>brain reacts on us  &quot; doing good &quot; by releasing &apos;feel-good&apos; <lb/> neurotransmitters, like oxytocin [24]. These concepts <lb/>have mostly been applied in relation to pro-social behav-<lb/>iour, but links have also been drawn to PEB [25]. <lb/> Behaviour change from a biological perspective <lb/> Physiological reactions are evoked by internal or external <lb/>stimuli. These reactions, steered by the brain, result in <lb/>particular behaviours that are beyond our control of will. <lb/>For example, stress stimuli automatically induce less <lb/>cognitively influenced behaviours, by impeding or sup-<lb/>pressing activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the <lb/>brain [26]. PFC is in charge of higher order cognitive <lb/>functions, memory, and decision making and stressful <lb/>stimuli may therefore induce less rationally based behav-<lb/>iours as consequence [27]. Thus, depending on type of <lb/>stimuli our decision making is unconsciously directed in <lb/>various ways. <lb/>Research in psychology and neuroscience has shown that <lb/>individual decision-making and subsequent behaviours <lb/>depend on both rational and non-deliberative, automatic <lb/>thinking [28, 29]. The rational system is controlled and <lb/>deductive, while the automatic is uncontrolled, associative <lb/>and environmentally determined [30]. External stimuli, <lb/>affecting the automatic system, activates various parts of <lb/>the brain, determining physiological reactions which in <lb/>turn guide our behaviour [31]. <lb/>Most research on human automatic processes has <lb/>examined social stimuli and social behaviour [25]. <lb/>Two major neuro-cognitive systems have been pro-<lb/>posed as being responsible for socialising behaviour; the <lb/>mirror neuron system [32] and the mentalizing system <lb/>[32, 33], especially the mirror neuron system believed to <lb/>occur automatically [29]. <lb/>Other studies in the field of social psychology have <lb/>looked at inducing commitment [16], but to date no con-<lb/>sistent solution has been proposed. More importantly, the <lb/>potential consequences of the theories and changes in <lb/>behaviour are seldom taken into account in public health <lb/>policies and activities. <lb/> Environmental stimuli and behaviour change <lb/> Compared to social factors or motivators, less research has <lb/>considered physical environmental stimuli and subsequent <lb/>automatically induced processes with behavioural impacts. <lb/>Some studies looking at effects of enriched environments <lb/>in rat models have revealed that stimulating environments <lb/>increase levels of neurotrophic factors with consequences <lb/>for behaviour, rats becoming more socially interactive [34]. <lb/>This demonstrates how environments with positive cues <lb/>induce certain behaviours, which might provide a first <lb/>insight into what environments may be particularly im-<lb/>portant for automatically changing also human behaviour. <lb/>However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown and <lb/>comparable human studies have not been performed. <lb/>Other studies on environment and behaviour, defined <lb/>within the scope of place-based determinants of life-style <lb/>behaviour, have suggested that physical activity levels can <lb/>increase by access to healthy environments [35]. <lb/>Research on concepts like  &quot; choice architecture &quot; or  &quot; nudg-<lb/> ing &quot; , have also touched on the idea of how more or less dis-<lb/>guised modifications of environmental features influence <lb/>life-style behaviour [36, 37]. However, far less attention has <lb/>been devoted to study health effects of behaviours other <lb/>than those that are directly life-style related. <lb/>Recent research, examining behavioural differences <lb/>along an urban-rural scale has opened a window of under-<lb/>standing on how environments influence neural process-<lb/>ing and behaviour. Epidemiological and neuroscientific <lb/>studies have demonstrated that urban (as compared to <lb/></body>

			<body> rural) dwellers have a higher risk of developing mental <lb/>disorders [38, 39] and also differ in their capacity to cope <lb/>with stress as indicated by changes in brain structure and <lb/>function [40]. There is reason to suspect, therefore, that <lb/>environmental cues may affect behaviour through auto-<lb/>matic reactions initiated by the brain&apos;s responses to the <lb/>environment, but the area is insufficiently explored and it is <lb/>unclear which environments might evoke particular behav-<lb/>iours. As urban environments seem to have a specific effect <lb/>on brain function and behaviour it may be interesting to <lb/>look into what is known about its counterpart -the natural <lb/>environment, including urban green spaces. <lb/> Natural environments and automatic behaviour <lb/> Natural environments, such as woodlands or urban green <lb/>spaces, are recognised for their positive effects on stress <lb/>relief, health, and wellbeing, partly mediated by automatic <lb/>physiological and neurophysiological reactions [41, 42]. <lb/>Nature also seems to have an impact on our cognitive <lb/>function [43]. Even brief encounters with nature and <lb/>passive exposure may result in immediate effects [44, 45]. <lb/>A recent brain-imaging study showed that exposure to na-<lb/>ture decreases rumination resulting in a reduced risk for <lb/>depression [46]. The evidence on improved human health <lb/>and wellbeing by green and natural environments is in-<lb/>creasing, showing effects on mental health [47, 48], phys-<lb/>ical condition with effects on for example cardiovascular <lb/>health [49], pregnancy outcomes [50], and cognitive and <lb/>behavioural development [51, 52]. As part of WHO&apos;s <lb/>environment and health programme, an urban green <lb/>space indicator has been developed as a proxy for a <lb/>city&apos;s public health potential [53]. <lb/>Drawing on these studies, one may suspect that expos-<lb/>ure to natural environments can have an immediate, <lb/>spontaneous behavioural impact through automatic <lb/>neuro-physiological reaction (see Fig. 1). That this be-<lb/>havioural impact would be in a pro-environmental direc-<lb/>tion is supported by a recently published study that <lb/>actually demonstrated that nature exposure may pro-<lb/>mote environmentally sustainable behaviour, at least in a <lb/>laboratory setting [54]. However, long-term effects and <lb/>mechanisms remain to be explored. <lb/>Other studies have shown that aesthetically pleasing na-<lb/>ture leads to prosocial behaviour [55], which in turn is con-<lb/>nected to PEB [56]. Another study revealed that increased <lb/>concern about marine sustainability was engendered by <lb/> &quot; nature exposure &quot; through visiting an aquarium [57]. It has <lb/>also been suggested that feelings of connectedness to, and <lb/>restoration from nature are linked to PEB [58, 59]. Even <lb/>childhood experiences in nature appear to enhance adult <lb/>environmentalism [60] a perturbing fact as children of <lb/>today spend less and less time outdoors [61]. <lb/>Much of the research on natural environments&apos; impact <lb/>on human beings sets itself within theoretical <lb/> Fig. 1 Relation between external stimuli, behaviour, environment and health.

			<body> frameworks referring to humans&apos; evolutionary develop-<lb/>ment in nature and how this might make us prone to <lb/>wellbeing and automatically induced stress recovery [62, <lb/>63]. Other theories focus on how attention restoration <lb/>in nature reduces mental fatigue and improves cognitive <lb/>functioning [64, 65]. Altogether, these theories point in <lb/>the same direction as suggested above – that nature may <lb/>indeed induce immediate unconscious and automatic re-<lb/>sponses. An evolutionary fundament to potential effects <lb/>on PEB by nature would suggest that the effect could <lb/>also be retained over time. <lb/> Discussion <lb/> Urbanisation, behaviour change, and future policies <lb/> In an increasingly urbanised society contact with nature <lb/>is diminishing [66]. In urban planning, densification <lb/>demands threaten parks and other urban green spaces. <lb/>We know about some of the negative health conse-<lb/>quences of this, such as increased prevalence of cardio-<lb/>vascular disease [67] as well as loss of ecosystem <lb/>services (ESS) for health [68]. Adding the potentially <lb/>negative effect on PEB by loss of green space makes the <lb/>health risks even more complex. <lb/>Efficient public health policies that manage to change <lb/>behaviours in an environmentally-friendly direction can <lb/>make substantial, as well as cost-efficient, long-term <lb/>contributions to climate-change mitigation and, as a co-<lb/>benefit, to public health [13]. <lb/>As results of media campaigns or education programmes <lb/>are often discouraging we may draw the conclusion that <lb/>rationality based approaches are probably not the best way <lb/>forward for changing behaviour that benefits environment <lb/>and health [69]. Instead we must focus on automatically <lb/>induced behaviour change and public policies should invest <lb/>in case studies, programmes and trials on such approaches, <lb/>in particular for promoting PEB [25]. In this context, we <lb/>argue that such efforts should stimulate research and <lb/>actions exploring links between natural environments and <lb/>PEB, creating an opportunity for nature-based solutions. <lb/> What we need to know <lb/> From existing studies we cannot predict what natural <lb/>environments would induce PEB, to what populations, <lb/>for how long the effect would remain, or what kind of <lb/>interactions would be required or even desirable and in <lb/>what type of settings. The notion of nature as health <lb/>promoting as such would still encourage studies and <lb/>attempts to look closer into the matter, especially since <lb/>interventions would most likely be cost-efficient and <lb/>with a low risk of harmful effects. There are already pol-<lb/>icies and programmes at hand which encourage  &quot; green <lb/> planning &quot; for healthier cities [70], though insufficiently <lb/>implied and the co-benefit of potential PEB and how to <lb/>optimise this outcome is rarely, if ever, considered. <lb/>There is a risk for wear off over time, i.e. if people <lb/>are continuously exposed to an abundance of nature <lb/>automatically induced PEB responses would decline It is <lb/>plausible that by establishing new urban green areas we <lb/>would get the same effect as by a campaign for PEB, where <lb/>people would initially respond positively [25], but as the <lb/>green area becomes the normative environment people <lb/>would shift to baseline in terms of behaviour. We would <lb/>argue that this is less likely. Various studies have in general <lb/>shown sustained effects of for example moving to greener <lb/>areas [71]. Nature as such is also an inherently changing <lb/>setting, in terms of for example growth and seasonality <lb/>and could re-evoke fascination and stimulation over time. <lb/>The various possible interactions with nature are also <lb/>close to infinite. However, these matters are essential to <lb/>investigate before any green investment are promoted, at <lb/>least if based on a PEB-inducing argument. <lb/>Another aspect, similar to studies on health–nature <lb/>associations, is the self-selection effect. It is possible that <lb/>people choosing to live in green areas are per se more <lb/>interested in the environment and thus maintain a <lb/>higher level of PEB. This calls for carefully designed <lb/>studies, including both longitudinal investigations as <lb/>experimental trials. <lb/> All we need is green? <lb/> If green spaces are indeed promoting PEB on a general <lb/>and automatic level, attention should be paid to establish <lb/>and maintain greenery where it is most needed, such as <lb/>areas of environmental degradation and where people <lb/>are less prone to ecological awareness. <lb/>From psychology and behavioural research, we know <lb/>that behaviour is not changed with one intervention [72]. <lb/>Multiple interventions are required, where nature expos-<lb/>ure could only be one. Likewise, we must acknowledge <lb/>that any measures taken to mitigate climate change and <lb/>its consequences represent only a small contribution to <lb/>the wider whole of redirecting our path from a grim future <lb/>towards one of greater wellbeing in a sustainable and <lb/>healthy environment. Attempting to increase PEB will not <lb/>result in a  &quot; silver bullet &quot; solution. However, as often is the <lb/>case in public health interventions, although the individual <lb/>effect sizes may be small, the consequences for entire pop-<lb/>ulations, and in this case, for the environment too, be-<lb/>come substantial. <lb/>Even if the evidence on nature&apos;s automatic effect on <lb/>PEB is lacking, we argue that the topic is worth further <lb/>exploration for informing future policies on an area call-<lb/>ing for innovative solutions – that of climate change and <lb/>public health. <lb/>By implying a  &quot; nature-exposure &quot;  model for PEB there <lb/>are also opportunities for  &quot; win-win-situations &quot;  by adding <lb/>the ecosystem services provided by green spaces, such as a <lb/>reduced urban heat island effect [73] and lower air <lb/></body>

			<body> pollution levels [74] to the indirect and long-term positive <lb/>health effects of PEB. There is even a potential for  &quot; win-<lb/> win-win-situations &quot; , as the use of green spaces in policies <lb/>and planning offer wider aspects of sustainability, includ-<lb/>ing economic, social, and environmental resilience [75]. <lb/> Conclusions <lb/> In the health sector there is as yet insufficient recognition <lb/>that our health is intimately linked to the sustainability of <lb/>ecosystems, wherein we live our lives. There is also a need <lb/>for increased understanding of how automatic decisions <lb/>and behaviour are evoked and the consequences this has <lb/>for our health and the environment. From the above cited <lb/>research a few inquiries arise –If the social environment <lb/>and other external stimuli affect the automatic system of <lb/>our brains to induce varied kinds of behaviours, is it <lb/>plausible that stimuli from the physical environment <lb/>would also generate specific brain reactions automatically <lb/>spurring us to behave in environmental friendly ways? <lb/>Can improved accessibility in people&apos;s daily lives to green <lb/>spaces be used as public health tools by automatically <lb/>evoking PEB? <lb/>This essay is a call for directing resources towards <lb/>and expanding the public health research agenda to <lb/>explore environmental factors that automatically may <lb/>induce PEB and as a consequence improve health. In-<lb/>vestigating specifically natural environments, may be a <lb/>particularly interesting line of research, partly because <lb/>of existing evidence on nature&apos;s automatic effects on <lb/>human physiological reactions, but also because of the <lb/>co-benefits in terms of ecosystem services to be <lb/>provided by more greenery. Apart from basic research <lb/>of neuro-anatomical, −functional, and -physiological <lb/>correlates, there are a wide range of interdisciplinary <lb/>challenges for applied research to disentangle. We need <lb/>to know what senses are involved, which environmental <lb/>factors stimulate the greatest responses, for which be-<lb/>haviours, in which populations, and also how we effi-<lb/>ciently and effectively can implement what we learn. <lb/>These challenges demand our attention now. <lb/> </body>
