			<front>RESEARCH ARTICLE <lb/>A validation of the PAWPER XL-MAC tape for <lb/>total body weight estimation in preschool <lb/>children from low-and middle-income <lb/>countries <lb/>Mike Wells ID * <lb/>Division of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, <lb/>South Africa <lb/>* mike.wells@emergencymedicine.co.za <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Importance <lb/>The PAWPER tape system is one of the three most accurate paediatric weight estimation <lb/>systems in the world. The latest version of the tape, which does not rely on a subjective <lb/>assessment of habitus, is the PAWPER XL-MAC method which uses length and mid-arm <lb/>circumference (MAC) to estimate weight. It was derived and validated in a population in the <lb/>USA and has not yet been fully validated in a population from a resource-limited setting. <lb/>Objective <lb/>The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PAWPER XL-MAC tape <lb/>weight estimation system in a large dataset sample of children from resource-limited <lb/>settings. <lb/>Methods <lb/>This was a &quot;virtual&quot; study in which weight estimates were generated using the PAWPER XL-<lb/>MAC tape and Broselow tape 2007B and 2011A editions in a very large open access data-<lb/>set. The dataset contained anthropometric information of children aged 6 to 59 months from <lb/>standardised nutritional surveys in 51 low-and middle-income countries. The performance <lb/>of PAWPER XL-MAC method was compared with the Broselow tape and a new length-and <lb/>habitus-based tape, the Ralston method. <lb/>Main outcomes and measures <lb/>The bias of the weight estimation methods was assessed using the mean percentage error <lb/>(MPE) and precision using the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of the MPE. The overall accu-<lb/>racy was denoted by the percentage of weight estimates falling within 10% and 20% of <lb/>actual weight (abbreviated as p10 and p20 respectively). <lb/>PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210332 January 7, 2019 <lb/>1 / 17 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>OPEN ACCESS <lb/>Citation: Wells M (2019) A validation of the <lb/>PAWPER XL-MAC tape for total body weight <lb/>estimation in preschool children from low-and <lb/>middle-income countries.

The p10 and p20 for each method were 79.3% and 96.9% for the PAWPER <lb/>XL-MAC tape, 64.3% and 91.0% for the Broselow tape 2007B, 55.5% and 85.9% for the <lb/>Broselow tape 2011A and 67.4 and 94.0% for the Ralston method respectively. The PAW-<lb/>PER XL-MAC system was statistically significantly more accurate than the Broselow tape <lb/>2011A, the Broselow tape 2007B and the Ralston method. The relative difference in accu-<lb/>racy (p10) was 43% (odds ratio 4.4 (4.4, 4.5), p&lt;0.001), 23% (odds ratio 2.9 (2.8, 2.9), <lb/>p&lt;0.001) and 18% (odds ratio 1.8 (1.8, 1.8), p&lt;0.001) compared to each method, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>Conclusions and relevance <lb/>The PAWPER XL-MAC tape performed well in this study and was statistically significantly <lb/>more accurate than both the Broselow tape editions and the Ralston method. This difference <lb/>was substantial and clinically important. The tape did not perform as well at extremes of hab-<lb/>itus-type, however, and might benefit from recalibration. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The importance of weight estimation <lb/>There are two sets of circumstances under which a child&apos;s bodyweight must be estimated: dur-<lb/>ing emergency care when a child cannot be weighed even if a scale is available and in resource-<lb/>limited settings where a scale might not be available at all [1, 2]. In both these examples, a <lb/>weight estimation system that could estimate weight accurately would be ideal to allow for the <lb/>correct calculation of drug doses [3]. <lb/>The PAWPER tape is one of the three most accurate weight estimation systems in the world <lb/>today, along with the Mercy method and parental estimates of weight [4, 5]. The PAWPER <lb/>tape system and the Mercy method are both dual length-and habitus-based methods which <lb/>have consistently been shown to be more accurate than one-dimensional systems. The PAW-<lb/>PER tape has also proven to be accurate both in high-income countries as well as low-and <lb/>middle-income countries [5, 6]. <lb/>The PAWPER tape systems <lb/>There are three versions of the PAWPER tape system: the original PAWPER tape (developed <lb/>in 2009), the PAWPER XL tape (developed in 2014) and the PAWPER XL-MAC tape (devel-<lb/>oped in 2016)-see Fig 1 for a description of the PAWPER XL-MAC tape system [3, 7, 8]. The <lb/>original PAWPER tape and the PAWPER XL tape both make use of body length and a visual <lb/>assessment of habitus to allow a weight estimate to be read directly off the tape [7]. The PAW-<lb/>PER XL tape is longer than the original tape (180cm vs 145cm) and has additional capabilities <lb/>to produce weight estimates in obese children (seven habitus categories vs five) [3]. The PAW-<lb/>PER XL-MAC tape is a completely objective system which makes use of mid-arm circumfer-<lb/>ence (MAC) to define habitus instead of relying on a visual assessment of habitus [8].

The PAWPER XL-MAC tape system. There are three steps to the use of the PAWPER XL-MAC tape.

			<body>The PAWPER XL-MAC tape was developed and validated using a combined National <lb/>Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey dataset from the USA [8]. <lb/>Although the tape performed very well in children of all weight categories, it would be of great <lb/>value to further evaluate the system in a population of much younger children from low-and <lb/>middle-income countries. <lb/>The Ralston tape was designed following a study using this dataset [9]. It is essentially a <lb/>(still theoretical) device with three side-to-side tapes: one to estimate the weight of &quot;normal&quot; <lb/>children (MAC&gt;125mm), one for &quot;moderately wasted&quot; children (MAC from 115 to 125mm) <lb/>and one for &quot;severely wasted&quot; children (MAC&lt;115mm). It was shown to be more accurate <lb/>than the Broselow tape but has not been compared to other contemporary dual length-and <lb/>habitus-based systems. <lb/>Objectives <lb/>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the PAWPER XL-MAC sys-<lb/>tem in this large dataset of children from low-and middle-income countries. The secondary <lb/>objective was to compare the performance of the PAWPER XL-MAC system with that of the <lb/>Broselow tape (the existing &quot;gold standard&quot;) and the tape proposed by Ralston et al [9]. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study design <lb/>This was a retrospective, observational, &quot;virtual&quot; weight estimation study (a virtual study is one <lb/>in which weight estimations are calculated from a database of anthropometric measurements, <lb/>rather than a study in which a weight estimation system is directly applied to an individual <lb/>child). The performance of the PAWPER XL-MAC system was evaluated using data from a <lb/>very large, recently-published, open-access dataset [9]. This dataset is comprised of anthropo-<lb/>metric data for children aged 6 to 59 months derived from growth studies conducted in multi-<lb/>ple low-and middle-income countries. <lb/>Dataset <lb/>The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6026504.v1. A full description of <lb/>the dataset can be found in the article by Ralston et al from which it was obtained [9]. The <lb/>dataset contains data from 2,434 nutritional anthropometric surveys from 51 low-and middle-<lb/>income countries. The data was collected over a period of 25 years, from August 1992 to May <lb/>2017 and contains information on 1,717,172 children aged from 6 to 59 months. The number <lb/>of data points differed slightly from the study by Ralston et al as some of the shared data <lb/>required permissions from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and was not <lb/>included in this study (83,150 children). The data included the country of origin, year of col-<lb/>lection, sex, measured weight, length (or height), mid-arm circumference, weight-for-age Z-<lb/>score, height-for-age Z-score and weight-for-age Z-score. The data collection methodology <lb/>was consistent across the surveys. Weight, height, and MAC measurements were standardized <lb/>and performed by teams of trained researchers. <lb/>Ethics <lb/>Ethical approval and informed consent was obtained for each individual surveys as described <lb/>by Ralston et al [9]. The source data were only collected after ethical approval was obtained <lb/>from locally responsible ethics committees. When no such ethics committees were function-<lb/>ing, ethical approval was acquired from the institutional review bodies of the non-<lb/></body>

			<body>governmental organization which collected the data. In addition, permissions were obtained <lb/>from the local ministries of health and, where appropriate, other governmental organizations. <lb/>Participation in the surveys was strictly voluntary. In all surveys, the consent procedure was <lb/>approved by institutional review boards and informed consent was obtained from the primary <lb/>caregiver of the child. Identifying data were removed before the dataset was made available <lb/>online. <lb/>The image of the child model in Fig 1 was included with written informed consent (as out-<lb/>lined in PLOS consent form) to publish this illustration. <lb/>Data generation <lb/>Although the weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores were available in <lb/>the dataset, the BMI and BMI-for-age Z-scores were not. These were calculated for each child <lb/>using a custom-designed spreadsheet formula based on the WHO BMI-for-age growth chart <lb/>data. <lb/>PAWPER XL-MAC weight estimations were generated from the dataset using the available <lb/>measurements of length (or height) and mid-arm circumference for each child. The cut-off <lb/>values of mid-arm circumference for each length-division of the PAWPER XL-MAC tape have <lb/>been published previously [8]. These values were incorporated into an excel formula which <lb/>then automatically calculated the estimated weights. The excel formula can be found in the <lb/>Supplementary material (S1 file). In order to provide a standard against which to compare the <lb/>PAWPER XL-MAC system, a similar process was followed to obtain weight estimations using <lb/>two versions of the Broselow tape (the 2007B and 2011A editions), using the length data only. <lb/>The length-segment data for the Broselow tape was obtained from a recent systematic review <lb/>on the tape [10]. The data on the performance of the Ralston method was obtained from the <lb/>paper in which it was described [9]. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>The data analysis followed the recommended methods for weight estimation studies which <lb/>focus on evaluating the bias, precision and overall accuracy of the weight estimation systems <lb/>[5]. Bias was determined using the mean percentage error (MPE), shown in Formula 1 below. <lb/>Percentage error ¼ 100 � <lb/>Estimated weight À Actual weight <lb/>Actual weight <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>A negative value would thus be indicative of an underestimation of weight. The precision <lb/>was determined using the Bland &amp; Altman 95% limits of agreement of the MPE as well as the <lb/>root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), shown in Formulae 2 and 3 below. <lb/>Limits of agreement ¼ MPE � 1:96 � standard deviation <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>where MPE represents mean percentage error. <lb/>Root mean square percentage error ¼ <lb/>S <lb/>ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi <lb/>PE 2 <lb/>p <lb/>n <lb/>ð3Þ <lb/>where PE represents percentage error and n the sample size. <lb/>Percentage error calculations were preferred over absolute values (in kg). The true, mea-<lb/>sured weights ranged from 3.3kg to 25kg in the dataset, almost a 10-fold difference in weight. <lb/>The implication of an error of 1kg is thus significantly different for a 3kg infant compared to a <lb/>25kg 5-year-old child. Therefore, the mean bias and limits of agreement (in kg) of untrans-<lb/>formed or unscaled data is not statistically or clinically useful. Either logarithmically <lb/></body>

			<body>transformed data or percentage error data is more useful but percentage error data is more <lb/>intuitive and easier to interpret. The overall accuracy of each weight estimation system was <lb/>determined by calculating the proportion of weight estimations falling within 10% and 20% of <lb/>actual, measured weight (p10 and p20 respectively). <lb/>Outcome measures <lb/>The overall accuracy (represented by the p10 and p20 data) was used as the primary outcome <lb/>measure as it best reflects the global performance of the weight estimation systems. It also most <lb/>closely reflects the implications of the weight estimation on drug dosing accuracy. An acceptable <lb/>outcome, based on previous studies, was a p10 of 70% and a p20 of 95% [5]. While the measures <lb/>of bias and precision were evaluated, they are more statistically useful for refining and calibrating <lb/>a weight estimation system and offer less intuitive information than overall accuracy. <lb/>Subgroup analyses <lb/>The data was analysed according to subgroups of age, weight and BMI-for-age z-score. The <lb/>age subgroups used were 6 to 12 months, 13 to 24 months, 25 to 36 months, 37 to 48 months <lb/>and 49 to 59 months. The weight subgroups were �10kg, 10.1 to 15kg and &gt;15kg. The BMI-<lb/>for-age subgroups used were Z�-2.0 (underweight), -2.0&lt;Z�-1.4 (thin), -1.4&lt;Z&lt;1.4 (&quot;nor-<lb/>mal&quot; weight), 1.4�Z&lt;2.0 (overweight) and Z�2.0 (obese). Since BMI-for-age subgroup data <lb/>was not available for the Ralston method, subgroup analyses and comparisons were performed <lb/>using their published weight-for-height data. The consistency of the outcomes was also evalu-<lb/>ated across the regions represented in the dataset. <lb/>Comparisons between systems <lb/>In order to facilitate comparisons of accuracy between the PAWPER and Ralston methods, <lb/>especially in subgroups, it was necessary to impute p10 and p20 data for the Ralston method. <lb/>This was done by calculating these data using Formula 4 below. This formula is accurate in <lb/>normally distributed data, as was true in this case. <lb/>p10 ¼ 100 � <lb/>R xþ10 <lb/>xÀ 10 f ðx; m; sÞ ¼ <lb/>1 <lb/>ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi <lb/>2ps <lb/>p <lb/>� e <lb/>À <lb/>ðxÀ mÞ 2 <lb/>2s 2 <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>ð4Þ <lb/>where p10 represents the proportion of weight estimates falling within 10% of actual weight, x <lb/>is the mean actual weight of the sample, μ is the mean estimate error and σ is the standard <lb/>deviation of the mean estimate error. <lb/>Where statistical comparisons between the weight estimation systems were considered nec-<lb/>essary, the paired t-test was used for comparisons of MPE and RMSPE and the McNemar test <lb/>was used for paired comparisons of p10 and p20. A difference of more than 10% between any <lb/>parameter was considered to be clinically or operationally important. Given the very large size <lb/>of the dataset, and the use of multiple statistical tests to compare weight estimation methods, a <lb/>0.1% significance level (p&lt;0.001) was used throughout to denote statistical significance and <lb/>reduce the likelihood of type I error. The effect sizes were quantified using odds ratios with <lb/>95% confidence intervals. <lb/>Software <lb/>Microsoft excel (Microsoft Excel for Mac version 16.14.1) and Graphpad Prism (GraphPad <lb/>Prism version 8.00 for Mac, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com) <lb/>were used for all data management and statistical analysis. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>A total of 1,717,172 children in the dataset had data available to produce a weight estimation <lb/>by the PAWPER XL-MAC system as well as two Broselow tape editions and were included in <lb/>the study. <lb/>Demographic data <lb/>A description of the demographic data of the sample population from the dataset can be found <lb/>in Table 1. <lb/>The distribution of children according to WHO weight-for-height, height-for-age and <lb/>weight-for-age Z-score classification is shown in Table 2. The majority of children were classi-<lb/>fied as &quot;normal&quot; (i.e. without severe malnutrition, major wasting or stunting), but there were <lb/>sufficient numbers of children in each category to test the weight estimation systems. Accord-<lb/>ing to the BMI-for-age classification, 23.1% of the children were underweight (Z�-2.0), 13.2% <lb/>were &quot;thin&quot; (-2.0&lt;Z�-1.4), 59.7% were of normal weight (-1.4&lt;Z&lt;1.4), 2.5% were overweight <lb/>(1.4�Z&lt;2.0) and 1.5% were obese (Z�2.0). <lb/>The overall results of the assessment of the performance of the three weight estimation sys-<lb/>tems are shown in Figs 2 and 3. The PAWPER XL-MAC system was statistically significantly <lb/>more accurate than the Broselow tape 2011A, the Broselow tape 2007B and the Ralston <lb/>method. The absolute and relative differences in accuracy (p10) were 24% and 43% (odds ratio <lb/>4.4 (4.4, 4.5), p&lt;0.001) compared to the Broselow tape 2011A, 15% and 23% (odds ratio 2.9 <lb/>(2.8, 2.9), p&lt;0.001) compared to the Broselow tape 2007B and 12% and 18% (odds ratio 1.8 <lb/>(1.8, 1.8), p&lt;0.001) compared to the Ralston method. These differences were all clinically rele-<lb/>vant. The details of the statistical analyses for the subgroup comparisons can be found in the <lb/>Supplementary material (S1 Table). <lb/>Figs 4, 5 and 6 show the accuracy outcome data for each system according to BMI-for-age <lb/>weight status (normal weight, underweight and overweight/obese). <lb/>Tables 3-6 show the results of the subgroup analyses of the performance of the weight esti-<lb/>mation systems according to sex, age, weight and weight status. <lb/>The subgroup analyses of accuracy using weight-for-height cutoffs for the PAWPER <lb/>XL-MAC and the Ralston method are shown in Fig 7. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>When comparing the most and least accurate systems (the PAWPER XL-MAC tape and the <lb/>Broselow tape 2011 edition A), there was between a 1.4-and 80.4-fold difference in accuracy. <lb/>This difference was substantially less between the PAWPER XL-MAC tape and the Ralston <lb/>method ranging between 1.2-and 1.4-fold differences. The full analyses can be found in the <lb/>Supplementary material (S1 Table). <lb/>There were no clinically important differences in the accuracy outcomes between the chil-<lb/>dren from the geographical regions represented in the dataset (Africa, Americas, South-East <lb/>Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East and the Western Pacific). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Performance of the PAWPER XL-MAC system <lb/>The PAWPER XL-MAC system performed well in this study and surpassed the predetermined <lb/>acceptable outcome criteria. It was substantially more accurate than both editions of the Brose-<lb/>low tape as well as the Ralston method (which was originally developed and validated from <lb/>this dataset). It was also consistently accurate across the geographical regions represented in <lb/>the dataset, between boys and girls and across the spectrum of age groups and weight catego-<lb/>ries represented. The PAWPER XL-MAC system was also accurate in all habitus groups except <lb/>severely underweight and obese children. Despite the lower accuracy at the extremes of habi-<lb/>tus, it was substantially and significantly more accurate than the other methods evaluated. <lb/>With respect to its accuracy at extremes of habitus, the performance of the PAWPER <lb/>XL-MAC system was not quite as good in this study as it was in the original validation study <lb/>[8]. The NHANES dataset used in that study, from a USA population, was markedly different <lb/>to the one used in this study, however [11]. The children were older (median 120 vs 30 <lb/>months), heavier (median 40.5 vs 11.1kg) and more overweight (median BMI-for-age Z-score <lb/>0.6 vs -0.9). The proportion of &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; weight children was also higher (70.6% <lb/>vs 59.7%). These differences may account for the difference in outcomes. For this system to <lb/>become truly globally accurate across the age and habitus spectrum, it will need to undergo <lb/>recalibration or fine-tuning and revalidation to maximise its accuracy (see below). It will also <lb/>need to be evaluated in prospective studies to determine the impact of human-factor errors <lb/>and inter-rater reliability. <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Performance of the Broselow tapes <lb/>The performance of the Broselow tapes in this dataset was similar to that reported in two <lb/>recent meta-analyses, which found a p10 range of 50 to 60% to be common [5, 10]. In this <lb/>study the Broselow tapes were accurate in children with &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; weight but <lb/>were very inaccurate in underweight and overweight/obese children. Since the Broselow tape <lb/>produces an estimate that more closely approximates ideal body weight (IBW) than total body <lb/>weight (TBW) this was to be expected [12]. Since IBW may far exceed TBW in underweight <lb/>Fig 2. Analyses of the overall accuracy of the weight estimation systems. The chart shows the proportion of weight <lb/>estimations falling within 10% and 20% of actual weight (p10 and p20 respectively) as well as the proportion of critical <lb/>weight estimation errors (&gt;20% error). The data for the Ralston method was obtained from the published study [9]. <lb/>The McNemar test was significant at the p&lt;0.001 level for every comparison of p10 and p20. The PAWPER XL-MAC <lb/>method&apos;s p10 beached the 10% improvement criterion when compared with the other methods.

			<body>children, the use of IBW could result in large drug overdoses in these children [13]. An accu-<lb/>rate estimation of TBW is required in all children, irrespective of habitus, to allow accurate <lb/>drug dosing [13, 14]. <lb/>The Broselow tape 2007B edition was actually more accurate than the more recent 2011A <lb/>edition. This was not surprising as the 2011A was the end-result of modifications to the 2007B <lb/>to reduce its underestimation of weight in children from well-nourished populations with a <lb/>high prevalence of obesity. This resulted in a worsening of overestimation of weight in children <lb/>from resource-limited settings. This has also been shown in previous studies from low-and <lb/>middle-income countries and emphasises the concerns about using the Broselow tape in these <lb/>settings [15-17]. <lb/>Fig 4. Accuracy of the three systems in &quot;normal weight&quot; children. The chart shows the proportion of weight <lb/>estimations falling within 10% and 20% of actual weight (p10 and p20 respectively) as well as the proportion of critical <lb/>weight estimation errors (&gt;20% error) for children with a BMI-for-age Z-score between -1.4 and 1.4. This subgroup <lb/>data was not available for the Ralston method as it information was not presented in the original publication.

			<body>These findings further highlight the value of the modern two-dimensional (length-and <lb/>habitus-based) weight estimation systems over one-dimensional (length-or age-based) sys-<lb/>tems [4]. The Broselow tape should no longer be considered as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in weight <lb/>estimation. The presence of drug dosing information on the tape is not sufficient to counter its <lb/>inaccuracy, as this information is incomplete and has not been shown to be beneficial without <lb/>additional resources [10]. <lb/>Performance of the Ralston method <lb/>The Ralston method performed reasonably well and was more accurate than the Broselow <lb/>tapes in the whole sample. It was less accurate than the Broselow tape 2007B in children with <lb/>&quot;average&quot; weight, but substantially more accurate in underweight children. <lb/>Fig 6.

			<body>PAWPER uses the 15 th and 5 th weight-for-height centiles to define weight categories while the <lb/>Ralston method uses the 1 st and the 5 th centiles. More importantly, the PAWPER system uses <lb/>MAC cut-off values within each length-segment to define habitus while the Ralston method <lb/>uses the WHO cut-off values for wasting for all children. This enables the PAWPER system to <lb/>fine tune the weight estimations to a greater degree. <lb/>There was no available data on the accuracy of the Ralston method in overweight children. <lb/>It is likely to be less accurate than both the Broselow 2011A tape and the PAWPER XL-MAC <lb/>method as it has no mechanism for habitus modification in these children and they are <lb/>grouped with the &quot;normal&quot; habitus. To be fair, the Ralston method was specifically designed <lb/>for resource-limited settings, but it must also be remembered that there can still be a signifi-<lb/>cant prevalence of overweight and obese children in low-and middle-income countries [18]. <lb/>A system that can provide an accurate weight estimation for a wide range of children is there-<lb/>fore required. Further work on the Ralston method may produce useful information to <lb/>advance length-and habitus-based weight estimation. <lb/>Other methods <lb/>The Mercy method makes use of humeral length (as a surrogate for body length) and MAC to <lb/>generate a weight estimate [19]. Some previous studies have shown the Mercy method to be <lb/>very accurate in populations with a high prevalence of young and underweight children [20, <lb/>21], while others have found it to be less accurate in these children [17].

			<body>The &quot;sophistication of simplicity&quot; <lb/>In order for a weight estimation system to be successful, it must be accurate and easy to use: <lb/>the &quot;sophistication of simplicity&quot; [12]. The PAWPER XL-MAC system fulfils these require-<lb/>ments as it makes use of straightforward, reliable anthropometric parameters from which a <lb/>weight estimation can be read directly off the tape, without requiring any calculations. Both <lb/>the PAWPER XL tape and Mercy methods have been tested in simulated paediatric <lb/>Fig 7. Accuracy outcomes by subgroups of weight-for-height. The p10 data is shown in the upper panel and the p20 <lb/>data in the lower panel. Children with a weight-for-height Z-score of �-2.0 were categorised as &quot;normal&quot;, between -2.0 <lb/>and -3.0 as &quot;moderately wasted&quot; and below -3.0 as &quot;severely wasted&quot;. The p10 data for the Ralston method was imputed <lb/>from the MPE data. The McNemar test was significant at the p&lt;0.001 level for every comparison of p10 and p20. We <lb/>considered the PAWPER XL-MAC method p10 to be clinically superior to all the other methods in all subgroups. The <lb/>Ralston method p10 was clinically superior to the Broselow tapes in wasted children. The PAWPER XL-MAC method <lb/>p20 was clinically superior to all other methods in all wasted children. The Ralston method p20 was also clinically <lb/>superior to the Broselow tapes in all wasted children. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210332.g007 <lb/></body>

			<body>resuscitations under adverse, clinically realistic circumstances and have been shown to be resil-<lb/>ient (i.e. maintain their accuracy) [22]. The use of MAC measurements is therefore reasonable <lb/>and appropriate as part of the weight estimation process, whether it is during an emergency <lb/>when a child cannot be weighed or in an environment where a scale is not available. <lb/>The need for recalibration <lb/>Although the PAWPER XL-MAC system achieved the predetermined acceptable outcome cri-<lb/>teria, its performance in severely underweight and obese children was not as good as in other <lb/>habitus types. A previous study with the original PAWPER tape in an obese USA population <lb/>had similar findings, even though the tape was still the most accurate of the methods evaluated. <lb/>It is not yet clear whether the inherent biological variability in the relationship between MAC <lb/>and body habitus will allow an increase in weight estimation accuracy using this methodology. <lb/>Nonetheless, the possibility of recalibrating the corrected weights or the MAC cut-off values in <lb/>the upper habitus categories needs to be explored in future versions of the tape. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>One of the major limitations of every weight estimation study is that it is not known what <lb/>degree of accuracy is required by a weight estimation system to prevent patient harm resulting <lb/>from drug dosing errors. Although we regard a p10 of 70% and a p20 of 95% as an indicator of <lb/>acceptable outcome, this is based on expert speculation only. <lb/>The second limitation of this study is that this was a &quot;virtual&quot; study with anthropometric <lb/>data obtained from a database rather than from the tape actually being used in clinical practice. <lb/>This provides very useful information on the potential accuracy of the weight estimation sys-<lb/>tems but does not provide evidence on human-and patient-factor errors and inter-user reli-<lb/>ability. However, the difference between &quot;virtual&quot; and &quot;in real life&quot; testing has never been <lb/>evaluated and it is not clear whether there would be a substantial difference in outcomes. <lb/>Finally, the need to impute some of the subgroup accuracy data for the Ralston method <lb/>may have influenced the statistical analysis. This was not likely to have altered any of the find-<lb/>ings to any significant degree, however. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>The PAWPER XL-MAC tape was the most accurate of the weight estimation systems evalu-<lb/>ated. It achieved the acceptable outcome criteria in the dataset of children from low-and mid-<lb/>dle-income countries as a whole and in all subgroups except children at the extremes of <lb/>habitus. Even in these subsets it outperformed the other systems. The tape needs to be vali-<lb/>dated in prospective studies to establish whether this accuracy can be maintained in clinical <lb/>practice. <lb/>The Ralston method showed promise, especially in profoundly wasted children, but needs <lb/>to be evaluated further, especially to see whether its methodology can be sustained in real-<lb/>world situations. <lb/>Both editions of the Broselow tape performed worse than the two-dimensional methods. <lb/>The Broselow tape should no longer be regarded as a &quot;gold standard&quot; method. <lb/></body>
