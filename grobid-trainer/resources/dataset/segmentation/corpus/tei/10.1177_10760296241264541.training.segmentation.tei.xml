Vitamin D deficiency is associated <lb/>with several severe health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, various cancers, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, <lb/>the objective of the current study is to investigate the correlation between Vitamin D levels and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in both <lb/>patients and controls. Materials and Methods: The study enrolled 163 T2DM (Group I) and 174 healthy (Group II) subjects to estimate <lb/>the level of Vit.-D and HbA1c in the blood serum of all subjects, using radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography, <lb/>respectively. Results: The results revealed that Group I had a lower level of Vit.-D (17.82 ± 2.23 ng/mL) than Group II. Similarly, they <lb/>have high HbA1c levels, showing significant (P &lt; 0.001; Student&apos;s t-test). Further, in Group I, Vit.-D levels were negatively correlated with <lb/>HbA1c levels (P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.07, linear regression). Group I and II combined analysis revealed an inverse relationship between Vit.-D <lb/>levels and HbA1c (P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.021). Conclusion: The study concluded a negative correlation between Vit.-D levels and HbA1c levels <lb/>in T2DM. However, Vit.-D therapy can recover this correlation, which helps control glycemic levels. <lb/>Keywords: Cholecalciferol, glycosylated hemoglobin, high-performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay, type 2 diabetes <lb/>mellitus, Vitamin D <lb/></front>

    <body>IntroductIon <lb/>Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become <lb/>increasingly prevalent. [1] The World Health Organization <lb/>reports that diabetes affects over three hundred and sixty <lb/>million people. World top scientists and experts predicted <lb/>that the number will rise to 552 million in 2030. [1] T2DM can <lb/>be screened by decreased insulin secretion, persistent <lb/>hyperglycemia, poor glucose tolerance, and complications <lb/>brought on by oxidative stress. [2] Vitamin D (Vit.-D) is <lb/>an essential secosteroid hormone associated with skeletal <lb/>integrity, bone health, and function. [3] In addition, various <lb/>studies have reported that T2DM seems to be associated <lb/>with an insufficient level of Vit.-D [3,4] and acts as a risk factor <lb/>for T2DM; it has been identified as mild-to-moderate Vit.-D <lb/>deficiency. [5] Furthermore, metabolic syndrome has been linked <lb/>to Vit.-D insufficiency [6] and specific polymorphisms in the <lb/>Vit.-D receptor gene associated with metabolic syndrome <lb/>symptoms. [7] However, some reports show that high levels <lb/>of Vit.-D have been linked to a decreased possibility of <lb/>developing diabetes mellitus (DM). [5-7] <lb/>Sunlight, nutrition, and supplements are all individual Vit.-D <lb/>sources. [8] The skin produces Vit.-D3 (cholecalciferol) through <lb/>exposure to ultraviolet rays. [8] Vit.-D in Vit.-D2 may be found <lb/>in various plant foods and supplements (ergocalciferol). Vit.-D <lb/></body>

    <body>each subject&apos;s weight in kilograms (kg) was divided by the <lb/>square of their height (H) in meters. This calculation yields a <lb/>numerical value to determine whether a person is underweight, <lb/>normal, overweight/or obese. It is important to note that the <lb/>BMI calculation has limitations and may not accurately <lb/>indicate body fatness for specific individuals, such as athletes <lb/>or older adults. However, for the general population, BMI can <lb/>be useful for assessing health risks associated with weight. <lb/>Sampling technique <lb/>To collect blood samples for serum separation, drew 3 mL of <lb/>blood from each enrolled subject. These samples were carefully <lb/>labelled and then stored in vials at a temperature of 4°C. Then, <lb/>the centrifuge vials were placed in the centrifuge for the serum <lb/>separation at 5000 rpm for 10 min; the further serum was used <lb/>for the Vit.-D estimation through radioimmunoassay (RIA). <lb/>Radioimmunoassay technique for measurement of <lb/>Vitamin D level <lb/>RIA was used to estimate Vit.-D through two steps. In the <lb/>first step, acetonitrile was used to extract Vit.-D and other <lb/>hydroxylated metabolites from serum quickly. Following <lb/>extraction, an antibody with specificity for Vit.-D was used in <lb/>a competitive RIA to analyze the treated samples. At 20°C to <lb/>25°C, the sample (serum), antibody (ab), and tracer were <lb/>incubated for 90 min. After 20 min of 20°C to 25°C incubation <lb/>with a second ab precipitating complex, phase separation <lb/>was achieved. After this incubation, the buffer was added <lb/>before centrifugation to lessen nonspecific binding. The <lb/>assay&apos;s sensitivity was 1.6 ng/mL or less. With 25(OH)D3, <lb/>recovery was close to 100%. The precision within and <lb/>between batches was 12% and 11%, respectively. <lb/>High-performance liquid chromatography techniques <lb/>for a measure of glycosylated hemoglobin <lb/>High-performance liquid chromatography was used to estimate <lb/>the level of HbA1c, with a total precision of 1.16%, a within-<lb/>run coefficient of variation of 0.78%, and a between-run <lb/>coefficient of variation of 0.52%. HbA1c was separated through <lb/>chromatography and a cation-exchange cartridge. The process <lb/>used for hemoglobin (Hb) analysis involved ion-exchange liquid <lb/>chromatography principles. The first step was to dilute and inject <lb/>the samples into an analysis cartridge automatically. In the <lb/>cartridge, the Hbs were separated based on their ionic interactions <lb/>with the cartridge material, and then, this separation was <lb/>achieved by using a programmed buffer gradient of increasing <lb/>ionic strength. Once the Hb was separated and directed to a filter <lb/>photometer&apos;s flow cytometer, in this case, the flow cytometer <lb/>was used to measure the amount of Hb present in the sample. <lb/>The filter photometer within the flow cytometer used filters to <lb/>select specific wavelengths of light, which were then used to <lb/>detect and measure the Hbs in the sample. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>The statistical software SPSS-19 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, <lb/>New York, United States) was used to assess the findings <lb/>statistically. Group I was compared with Group II (control <lb/>refers to both of these types, Vit.-D3 and Vit.-D2. Vit.-D has <lb/>two phases of hydroxylation to obtain biological activity: the <lb/>first phase in the C-25 position, completed in the liver with the <lb/>synthesis of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25[OH]D); the second <lb/>phase in the C-1 position. Universally, the substance 25(OH) D <lb/>is recognized as the primary indicator of Vit.-D status. [8] <lb/>In addition, it has been shown that Vit.-D levels in people with <lb/>T2DM negatively correlate with glycosylated hemoglobin <lb/>(HbA1c); however, Vit.-D may also affect how glucose is <lb/>regulated. [9] In addition, lacking or low level of Vit.-D appears to <lb/>increase the risk of developing T2DM in people of all ages. [9,10] <lb/>This present study aimed to estimate the levels of 25(OH) D3 <lb/>and HbA1c and also examined the association between those <lb/>levels and glycemic management in individuals with T2DM <lb/>and non-T2DM (NT2DM). <lb/>MaterIals and Methods <lb/>Study subjects, study design, and sample size <lb/>In the current study total sample size, 336 subjects were recruited <lb/>and further divided into two groups: in Group I, 163 patients <lb/>with T2DM were enrolled, while Group II considered 176 <lb/>healthy individuals of the same sex and age (20-70). The <lb/>inclusion criteria were age 20-70, mean age 56.64 ± 11.27 years, <lb/>and 25(OH) D3 levels, and those with 6.5% or more than HbA1c <lb/>levels are T2DM. This cross-sectional study was carried <lb/>out from June 2021 to June 2022. Subjects were enrolled after <lb/>taking signed informed consent forms from participants in the <lb/>present study. All participants were screened to determine <lb/>whether they should be as the inclusion criteria (age-related <lb/>Vit.-D deficiency in participants who have T2DM). The current <lb/>study was conducted in the Department of Internal Medicine <lb/>and Obstetrics and Gynaecology of two hospitals -(1) Moti <lb/>Lal Nehru Hospital, Allahabad, and (2) Sir Sunderlal Hospital, <lb/>Varanasi, of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The ethics <lb/>committees have provided approval for the study. <lb/>The study applied specific exclusion criteria, including the <lb/>following: patients who had taken Vitamin D supplements within <lb/>three months prior to or during the study, individuals with extreme <lb/>obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] of ≤35 kg/m²), <lb/>pregnant participants, individuals with granulomatous diseases, <lb/>those with depression, individuals with malabsorption syndrome <lb/>(MAS) or liver failure, participants with a glomerular filtration <lb/>rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m², individuals with hypercalcemia, and <lb/>those who had experienced allergic reactions to Vitamin D therapy. <lb/>Additionally, having 25(OH) D3 levels ≤60 ng/mL was considered <lb/>a potential risk factor for hypercalcemia. <lb/>Anthropometric data collection <lb/>The anthropometric analysis involved measuring the heights <lb/>and weights of enrolled subjects using specific instruments. <lb/>The subjects&apos; heights were measured to the nearest <lb/>centimeter (cm) using a wall-mounted stadiometer machine. <lb/>The subjects&apos; weights were assessed on a medical scale while <lb/>wearing light indoor attire.

    <body>(P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.07; linear regression analysis) [Figure 1], and it <lb/>found that Vit.-D levels were negatively correlated with HbA1c <lb/>levels (P &lt; 0.001: r2 = 0.021) [Figure 2]. <lb/>dIscussIon <lb/>Vit.-D is an essential steroid hormone that plays several vital <lb/>roles in the body, including supporting bone health, promoting <lb/>immune function, and regulating mood and mental health. [11] <lb/>However, many people are unaware of the importance of <lb/>Vit.-D and may not receive enough of it through their diet or <lb/>exposure to sunlight. [11] <lb/>In tropical regions, people may avoid indoor activities to <lb/>increase their exposure to sunlight, a natural source of Vit.-D. <lb/>However, even in these regions, people may still be at risk <lb/>of Vit.-D deficiency if they spend most of their time indoors <lb/>or have darker skin, which can reduce the skin&apos;s ability to <lb/>produce Vit.-D from sunlight. In addition to sunlight, Vit.-D <lb/>can be obtained through regular intake of foods such as fatty <lb/>fish, fortified dairy products, and some mushrooms. It is <lb/>essential to consider these natural sources of Vit.-D when <lb/>considering the body&apos;s overall Vit.-D status. Thus, adequate <lb/>intake of Vit.-D through sunlight and diet can help promote <lb/>optimal health and prevent deficiency-related health <lb/>problems. [11] <lb/>Vit.-D is critical in regulating cellular, neuromuscular, and <lb/>ossification functions. [11] Children who lack Vit.-D can develop <lb/>rickets, while adults who lack Vit.-D can develop osteocalcin, <lb/>osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and autism; [12] therefore, its <lb/>supplements are essential to treat Vit.-D deficiency-related <lb/>diseases such as diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), and <lb/>cardiovascular-disease. [9] <lb/>The Canadian Dietary Guidelines for Recommendation <lb/>propose 600 international units (IU) of Vit.-D for the age <lb/>group from 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for people aged 71 years <lb/>and above 71. [13] However, developed and developing <lb/>countries have been shown to lack sufficient Vit.-D [14] and <lb/>also noted that more than 36% of individuals in the United <lb/>States (US) are associated with Vit.-D. [15] In developing <lb/>countries, 41% of Children in developing countries suffer <lb/>from a severe Vit.-D deficiency, and around 87% of pregnant <lb/>women revealed an epidemic in females. [16,17] <lb/>In this study, the Vit.-D levels were observed within the <lb/>normal range in only Group II (control). Still, they were <lb/>group) using the Student&apos;s t-test. The correlation between <lb/>Vit.-D and HbA1c levels was analyzed using regression. <lb/>Regression analysis parameters were tested for normality <lb/>using histograms of standardized residuals and p-p plots of <lb/>standardized regression residuals. A Chi-squared test was <lb/>used to compare how many people in the patient and control <lb/>groups had Vit-D deficiency and insufficiency. <lb/>results <lb/>Table 1 represents sociodemographic data -the ages, sexes, <lb/>and different forms of BMI of DM and NT2DM after analysis. <lb/>Age between study groups and between the sexes was not <lb/>significantly different. We found that having DM usually <lb/>correlated with a high BMI. <lb/>HbA1c percentages were 8.03% ±0.49% in Group I (T2DM) <lb/>and 4.62% ±1.06% in Group II (control), respectively (P &lt; <lb/>0.001). The study revealed that higher concentration of HbA1c <lb/>in Group I (T2DM) than Group II [Table 2]. Similarly, levels of <lb/>Vit.-D was lower in Group I than in Group II (17.82 ± 2.23 ng/ <lb/>mL and 24.31 ± 3.20 ng/mL), respectively (P &lt; 0.001) [Table 1]. <lb/>Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) <lb/>values for the two groups (T2DM and control), 25(OH) D3 (ng/ <lb/>mL), and HbA1c (%), as well as their statistical significance <lb/>(Student&apos;s t-test), as well as the number and percentage of <lb/>subjects with 25(OH) D3 deficiency and insufficiency (25[OH] <lb/>D3 10 ng/mL and 20 [Chi-squared test]).

    <body>Although the proper mechanisms underlying the association <lb/>between Vit.-D and glucose metabolism are not fully <lb/>understood, some studies suggest that Vit.-D may improve <lb/>insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, essential for <lb/>maintaining healthy glucose metabolism. [20] These findings <lb/>highlight the importance of maintaining adequate Vit.-D levels <lb/>for optimal glucose metabolism and overall health. However, <lb/>further research is needed to fully understand the relationship <lb/>between Vit.-D and glucose metabolism and the potential <lb/>benefits of Vit.-D supplementation in preventing or managing <lb/>T2DM. [20] <lb/>Other studies have shown that higher plasma Vit.-D levels <lb/>were linked to a decreased risk/possibility of T2DM. [21] <lb/>However, higher plasma Vit.-D evaluated repeatedly was <lb/>related to a decreased probability of developing diabetes in <lb/>high-risk patients, as reported in a prospective observational-<lb/>clinical trial study with a mean follow-up of 2.7 years. [20,21] <lb/>A robust negative connection between baseline 25(OH) <lb/>D3 and fasting glucose at follow-up was found in a <lb/>longitudinal study of the factors influencing insulin resistance <lb/>and metabolic syndrome. [22] Vit.-D levels were inversely <lb/>related (negative relationship) to an incidence of diabetes. [5] <lb/>T2DM patients had lower 25(OH) D3 levels than controls in <lb/>the current study. A previous study discovered an increased <lb/>risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome <lb/>associated with Vit.-D deficiency. [23,24] In another study, the <lb/>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-III, it <lb/>was found that people (8421 participants) with metabolic <lb/>syndrome had significantly associated with lower levels of <lb/>Vit.-D. [5] <lb/>found below average (lower or insufficient) ranges in Group <lb/>I (T2DM) subjects. Furthermore, there was an inverse <lb/>correlation with Group II, which suggests that Vit.-D levels <lb/>may affect glucose control in T2DM. [18] <lb/>In our study, when we combined Type 2 diabetes patients <lb/>(Group I) and controls (Group II), we observed an inverse <lb/>relationship between the levels of Vitamin D and HbA1c. This <lb/>means that as Vitamin D levels increased, HbA1c levels <lb/>decreased in the combined group. The study was supported <lb/>by several authors [17] . Thus, it seems that Vit.-D appears to <lb/>be associated with T2DM glucose control. Furthermore, <lb/>percentage wise, T2DM patients had significantly higher rates of <lb/>Vit-D insufficiency or deficiency. Subsequently, a few studies <lb/>have shown a higher prevalence of Vit.-D deficiency in T2DM, <lb/>which is significantly associated with depressive symptoms. [17] <lb/>Individuals with severe impairment were usually older than 70 <lb/>years and more likely to have a mood problem. Although several <lb/>studies have produced contradictory findings, Vit.-D deficiency <lb/>has been linked to anxiety and depression. [17,18] <lb/>Several other cross-sectional studies have found an inverse <lb/>correlation between Vit.-D and markers of glucose metabolism, <lb/>such as fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and glucose tolerance <lb/>test readings. [19] This suggests that low levels of Vit.-D may be <lb/>associated with impaired glucose metabolism and an increased <lb/>risk of developing T2DM. [20] <lb/>Further, a recent study supports this association by <lb/>demonstrating an inverse relationship between 25(OH) D3 <lb/>levels and insulin resistance, which is a crucial feature of <lb/>T2DM. This relationship was most substantial at 25(OH) D3 <lb/>levels between 16 and 36 ng/mL.

Furthermore, the discovery of a negative <lb/>correlation between Vitamin D levels and HbA1c levels is an <lb/>exciting finding. It is well-established that Vit.-D plays a vital <lb/>role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity; therefore, <lb/>its deficiency can contribute to the development and <lb/>progression of T2DM. <lb/>The intervention studies that showed improvement in glucose <lb/>control with Vit.-D supplementation are consistent with <lb/>previous research on the topic. However, it is essential to note <lb/>that the optimal dosage and duration of Vit.-D supplementation <lb/>for individuals with T2DM is still debated among researchers. <lb/>While the recommendation for clinicians to recommend 2000 <lb/>IU of cholecalciferol daily for 16 weeks is a good starting <lb/>point, it is essential to consider each individual&apos;s Vit.-D status, <lb/>medical history, and any potential drug interactions before <lb/>making a recommendation. A personalized approach to Vit.-D <lb/>supplementation is necessary to ensure safety and efficacy. Our <lb/>study highlights the importance of assessing Vit.-D status in <lb/>individuals with T2DM and the potential benefits of Vit.-D <lb/>supplementation in improving glucose control. <lb/>lIMItatIon of study <lb/>The current study was not eligible to conclude a cause-and-<lb/>effect relationship between Vit.-D deficiency and T2DM due <lb/>to the observational nature of the investigation. Furthermore, <lb/>as recommended, Vit.-D was selected as a marker of Vit.-D <lb/>inadequacy. However, the active form of Vit.-D is 25(OH)2 <lb/>D3, which circulates in the blood in various forms. Assessing <lb/>Vit.-D deficiency in humans, particularly those with diabetes, <lb/>requires more research using better instruments. Long-term <lb/>glycemic control and Vit.-D supplementation monitoring <lb/>require additional research in T2DM. <lb/></body>
