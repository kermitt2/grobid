CBC pro-<lb/>grams often rely on the distribution of wildlife benefits to communities to fos-<lb/>ter tolerance of wildlife, with the idea that those benefits can offset costs <lb/>arising from human-wildlife conflict. A survey of residents in four Namibian <lb/>CBC areas found that different benefit types varied significantly in their rela-<lb/>tionship with whether respondents felt that wildlife improved their lives. Some <lb/>higher monetary value benefits evidenced a negative and/or non-significant <lb/>relationship with respondents&apos; perceptions, whereas meat-based benefits were <lb/>associated with a greater likelihood of residents feeling that they benefited <lb/>from wildlife. These findings suggest that the impact of different benefit types <lb/>in CBC programs may depend on a host of cultural/social, psychological, and <lb/>community-specific factors. From a practical standpoint, the form of direct <lb/>monetary benefits may matter, and cultural considerations likely play an <lb/>important role in determining which and when specific benefits are more <lb/>effective. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>Africa, benefits, CBNRM, community-based conservation, conservancy, human-wildlife <lb/>conflict, Namibia, wildlife <lb/></front>

        <body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>Community-based conservation (CBC) is a popular wildlife <lb/>governance approach 1 that has been adopted across the <lb/>global south, particularly in southern and eastern Africa <lb/>(Carpenter, 2021, 2022; Gruber, 2010; Roe et al., 2009). CBC <lb/>seeks to incentivize local communities to actively partici-<lb/>pate in wildlife conservation efforts by devolving to them <lb/>control over and the right to profit from wildlife resources <lb/>(Child &amp; Barnes, 2010; Pienaar et al., 2013; Störmer <lb/>et al., 2019). As implemented, the approach generally relies <lb/>on the distribution of wildlife-generated benefits to increase <lb/>the tolerance of wildlife by rural populations (Scanlon &amp; <lb/>Kull, 2009), hinging on the central tenet that people will <lb/>participate in the sustainable management of wildlife if the <lb/>perceived benefits associated with wildlife outweigh (or at <lb/>least equal) the perceived costs (Gosling et al., 2017; <lb/>Mogende &amp; Kolawole, 2016; Thakadu, 2005). <lb/>At the level of the individual, costs associated with <lb/>wildlife management arise because of human-wildlife con-<lb/>flict (HWC), a term referring to monetary and <lb/>non-monetary harm experienced by people because of <lb/></body>

        <front>Received: 8 January 2024 <lb/>Revised: 17 July 2024 <lb/>Accepted: 29 July 2024 <lb/>DOI: 10.1111/csp2.13217 <lb/>This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided <lb/>the original work is properly cited. <lb/>© 2024 The Author(s).

        <body>wildlife. HWC can manifest in multiple direct forms, <lb/>including livestock predation, crop-raiding and food stores <lb/>destruction, disease transmission to livestock and people, <lb/>and attacks on humans (Dickman, 2010; Meyer &amp; <lb/>Börner, 2022). HWC can also include passive forms of con-<lb/>flict, such as limitations on economic opportunities or life-<lb/>style choice. Examples of this form of conflict can include <lb/>loss of grazing territory, foregone schooling or employment <lb/>opportunities because of the need to guard crops or live-<lb/>stock, or social stigmas associated with the loss of a family <lb/>member due to HWC (Barua et al., 2013; Carpenter, 2022). <lb/>The presence of HWC can significantly decrease the will-<lb/>ingness of individuals to tolerate (and, hence, sustainably <lb/>manage) &quot;problem&quot; wildlife (Pienaar et al., 2013). <lb/>CBC has realized mixed results in practice, and a <lb/>robust body of research explores both the governance <lb/>approach and the impact of benefits as a whole on the <lb/>opinions or attitudes of CBC participants toward conserva-<lb/>tion efforts (e.g., Cooney et al., 2018; Sampaio dos Reis &amp; <lb/>Benchimol, 2023). CBC outcomes have been found to be <lb/>associated with a host of factors both internal and external <lb/>to participating communities, including the size and distri-<lb/>bution of conservation benefits (e.g., Calfucura, 2018; <lb/>Meyer et al., 2021; Waylen et al., 2010). A range of theoret-<lb/>ical frameworks, including but not limited to social <lb/>exchange theory, behavioral economics, environmental <lb/>criminology, social-ecological systems, and expectancy <lb/>models (e.g., theory of reasoned action and theory of <lb/>planned behavior), have also been applied to explain indi-<lb/>viduals&apos; tolerance of wildlife and decision-making in the <lb/>presence of HWC (e.g., McCleery, 2009; Mogomotsi <lb/>et al., 2020; Ntuli et al., 2021; Sethi, 2022). <lb/>Limited field research suggests that a substantive dif-<lb/>ference may exist between direct and indirect (individual <lb/>or household-level vs. community-level) benefits, as well <lb/>as between monetary and non-monetary benefit types in <lb/>fostering greater tolerance of wildlife (e.g., Kansky &amp; <lb/>Knight, 2014). However, CBC benefits can take myriad <lb/>forms (Ashley, 1998; Jani et al., 2022; Suich, 2013), and <lb/>few field studies have evaluated the individual effects of <lb/>each of those different benefit types on residents&apos; atti-<lb/>tudes toward wildlife. This article addresses this gap in <lb/>our understanding by examining the perceptions of resi-<lb/>dents in four Namibian Conservancies (CBC areas). Spe-<lb/>cifically, I examine the relationship between the benefit <lb/>types received by residents and their perceptions regard-<lb/>ing the impact of wildlife on their lives. <lb/>2 | PREDICTIONS <lb/>I was unable to identify any previously tested, systematic <lb/>predictions regarding the respective impacts of different <lb/>benefit types. However, a small body of relevant field <lb/>research supports the generation of the following two <lb/>predictions: <lb/>Prediction 1: The receipt of any type of direct house-<lb/>hold benefit will increase the likelihood that a person <lb/>feels that wildlife improves his or her life. <lb/>Prediction 2: The receipt of direct monetary benefits, <lb/>such as wages or cash distributions, will have a greater <lb/>positive effect on recipients&apos; opinions regarding the <lb/>impact of wildlife on their lives than will the receipt of <lb/>direct non-monetary benefits, such as meat distributions. <lb/>Field studies of CBC regimes find that widely distrib-<lb/>uted and higher-value benefits increase residents&apos; support <lb/>for conservation efforts (Angula et al., 2018; MacKenzie <lb/>et al., 2017). Residents in CBC areas rarely directly <lb/>receive benefits, compared with indirect community-level <lb/>benefits such as schools or infrastructure improvements, <lb/>but even a limited distribution of direct benefits can be <lb/>significant as these areas often lack economic opportuni-<lb/>ties (Gosling et al., 2017). Households prioritize the <lb/>receipt of food, cash, and jobs from CBC programs, with <lb/>cash and employment being particularly desired (Naidoo, <lb/>Fisher, et al., 2016; Pienaar et al., 2014). Cash distribu-<lb/>tions can be especially important because they allow <lb/>households to purchase provisions and pay for school <lb/>fees (Pienaar et al., 2014; Scanlon &amp; Kull, 2009). <lb/>Monetary benefits are linked to increased tolerance of <lb/>certain wildlife species and higher support for CBC <lb/>efforts (Kansky et al., 2020; Meyer &amp; Börner, 2022). 2 <lb/>However, while cash payments may demonstrate overall <lb/>efficacy, distributions in the form of predation compensa-<lb/>tion payments may not meaningfully counteract lowered <lb/>perceptions of CBC efforts caused by experience with <lb/>HWC (Meyer &amp; Börner, 2022). <lb/>In comparison to cash, the impact of meat is less clear. <lb/>Suich (2013) found that meat benefits have little impact on <lb/>recipients&apos; perceptions of wildlife because of the benefit&apos;s <lb/>relatively low economic value. On the other hand, Störmer <lb/>et al. (2019) found that both meat benefits and the pres-<lb/>ence of high levels of hunting benefits were associated <lb/>with positive attitudes toward wildlife, while Jones and <lb/>Weaver (2009) observed that recipients of direct benefits <lb/>such as meat and employment tend to have a more posi-<lb/>tive view of the impact of CBC on their lives. <lb/>It is important to note the limitations of the above <lb/>predictions. First, I rely only on existing field-based CBC <lb/>research that allows for differentiation of the impact of <lb/>different benefit types, rather than on broader literature <lb/>that discusses the role of undifferentiated benefits. Sec-<lb/>ond, I do not turn to literature outside of field-based CBC <lb/>studies, and I therefore do not make any predictions <lb/>based on socio-cultural factors or behavioral/ <lb/>psychological frameworks discussed therein. 3 Rather, the <lb/></body>

        <body>predictions stated above are narrowly designed to test <lb/>the applicability of findings from prior field studies to the <lb/>CBC jurisdictions included in this study. It is my hope <lb/>that the findings from this study will inform future, <lb/>broader investigations into the efficacy of different bene-<lb/>fit types. <lb/>3 | MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>3.1 | Site selection and development of <lb/>surveys <lb/>This study administered household-level surveys in four <lb/>conservancies (formally recognized CBC areas) in <lb/>Namibia&apos;s northwestern Kunene region (Figure 1). The <lb/>selected conservancies-from West to East, Puros, Ses-<lb/>fontein, Anabeb, and Omatendeka (collectively referred <lb/>to here as the &quot;study area&quot;)-are of similar age and each <lb/>reported earning greater wildlife-generated income than <lb/>losses from HWC during the period of 2014-2017 <lb/>(Namibian Association of CBNRM Support Organisations <lb/>[NACSO], 2017). The conservancies earn their income <lb/>through various combinations of phototourism, safari <lb/>hunting, and external governmental and non-<lb/>governmental support. <lb/>I met with traditional authorities and conservancy <lb/>representatives for each of the conservancies in May 2017 <lb/>to administer semi-structured interviews of those individ-<lb/>uals and to obtain permission to administer the survey. I <lb/>pretested the survey instrument used in this study in the <lb/>Otjambangu Conservancy, which sits east of the Puros <lb/>Conservancy and north of the remaining three selected <lb/>conservancies. Additional information about the study <lb/>area and development of the survey can be found in the <lb/>Supporting Information. <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Map of Namibia&apos;s Conservancies with highlighted study area.

        <body>3.2 | Survey administration <lb/>Household-level survey administration took place <lb/>between September and December 2017. Measurement at <lb/>the household-level is appropriate given that direct bene-<lb/>fits in these conservancies are often distributed at that <lb/>level. <lb/>The population in the study area was widely dis-<lb/>persed with a low population density, preventing the use <lb/>of probability sampling. To ensure that the respondents <lb/>to the survey reflected the composition of the overall <lb/>population as closely as possible, this study used non-<lb/>proportional quota sampling. Otherwise, the administra-<lb/>tors attempted, where possible, to randomize the pattern <lb/>by which households were selected for participation. <lb/>The participants were assured of anonymity, their <lb/>names were not recorded by the survey administrators, <lb/>and the research received both Institutional Review Board <lb/>approval and permission from Namibia&apos;s Ministry of Envi-<lb/>ronment and Tourism. Additional information regarding <lb/>participant sampling and survey design/administration <lb/>can be found in the Supporting Information. <lb/>3.3 | Selected survey questions <lb/>Respondents were asked the following questions regard-<lb/>ing both their perceptions of wildlife impact and the ben-<lb/>efits they received from the conservancy: <lb/>3.3.1 | Perceptions of wildlife impact <lb/>(outcome variable) <lb/>• Respond to the question: &quot;Overall, has wildlife made <lb/>your own life better, worse, or about the same?&quot; <lb/>3.3.2 | Benefits (explanatory variables of <lb/>interest) <lb/>• Identify if they or anyone in their household was <lb/>employed by their conservancy. <lb/>• Identify whether they had received any of the follow-<lb/>ing benefits from their conservancy: <lb/>1. Cash payments <lb/>2. Meat from animals killed by a trophy hunter <lb/>3. School scholarship or other educational expenses <lb/>4. Funeral assistance 4 <lb/>5. Business loans <lb/>6. Use of infrastructure improvement (e.g., borehole <lb/>or conservancy vehicle) <lb/>7. Other <lb/>The question regarding participants&apos; perception of <lb/>wildlife was purposefully undefined, and preceded more <lb/>specific questions regarding predation, monetary payouts, <lb/>meat distributions, and the like. Individuals can and do <lb/>include both tangible (e.g., meat or money) and intangi-<lb/>ble (e.g., symbolic or esthetic) considerations in their <lb/>evaluation of wildlife (ex., Jones &amp; Weaver, 2009). The <lb/>positioning and wording of this question allowed respon-<lb/>dents to weigh any and all considerations in assessing <lb/>whether they gain from wildlife. The full survey is con-<lb/>tained in the Supporting Information, together with <lb/>demographic information regarding respondents. <lb/>3.4 | Alternate explanatory variables <lb/>Respondents were asked to provide information regard-<lb/>ing the following alternate explanatory variables, which <lb/>were included across various models as discussed below: <lb/>• Respondent&apos;s gender; <lb/>• Respondent&apos;s age; <lb/>• Household wealth (measured by number of livestock); <lb/>• Respondent&apos;s level of education; <lb/>• Household size; <lb/>• The conservancy in which the respondent resides; and <lb/>• Whether the household had suffered any loss of live-<lb/>stock or crops from predation within the prior <lb/>12 months. <lb/>Females are often found to be less likely to view wild-<lb/>life positively than are men (Dressel et al., 2015; <lb/>Kaltenborn et al., 1999; Kellert &amp; Berry, 1987; <lb/>Sundaresan et al., 2012), although some studies have not <lb/>found any meaningful gender-based differences in per-<lb/>ceptions of wildlife (Dressel et al., 2015; Parry &amp; <lb/>Campbell, 1992; Störmer et al., 2019) or have found that <lb/>women perceive wildlife more favorably (Barthwal &amp; <lb/>Mathur, 2012; Dressel et al., 2015). Age is frequently neg-<lb/>atively associated with attitudes toward wildlife (Angula <lb/>et al., 2018; Bjerke et al., 1998; Dressel et al., 2015; <lb/>Kaltenborn et al., 1999). Increased education levels are <lb/>generally associated with more positive views of wildlife <lb/>(Barthwal &amp; Mathur, 2012; Bjerke et al., 1998; Dressel <lb/>et al., 2015; but see Störmer et al., 2019). <lb/>Wealth has sometimes been identified as impacting <lb/>views of wildlife and wildlife conservation, although no <lb/>clear direction for that relationship exists, with prior <lb/>studies finding both that wealth is positively correlated <lb/>(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009; Romañach et al., 2007) and <lb/>negatively correlated (Kanapaux &amp; Child, 2011; Silva &amp; <lb/>Mosimane, 2012) with attitudes toward wildlife. House-<lb/>hold size appears to be negatively associated with <lb/></body>

        <body>attitudes toward wildlife and formal wildlife conservation <lb/>(Ochieng et al., 2021; Shrestha &amp; Alavalapati, 2006). <lb/>Finally, past exposure to HWC is associated with the <lb/>development of negative attitudes toward wildlife and/or <lb/>specific wildlife species (Carter et al., 2014; Kansky <lb/>et al., 2016; Ochieng et al., 2021; Songorwa et al., 2000; <lb/>Spiteri &amp; Nepalz, 2006). <lb/>3.5 | Method of analysis <lb/>I employed a two-stage exact logistic regression (ELR) <lb/>(Carpenter, 2021), in which the first stage examined the <lb/>probability that a respondent would select a response <lb/>coded higher than &quot;À1&quot; for the outcome variable <lb/>(i.e., that she feels wildlife made her life about the same <lb/>or better), and the second stage explored the probability <lb/>that a respondent would select a response of &quot;1&quot; <lb/>(i.e., wildlife made her life better). This two-stage analysis <lb/>mirrors the approach used in generalized ordered logit <lb/>models (GOLMs) (a.k.a., proportional odds models), in <lb/>that both methods of analysis utilize a series of cumula-<lb/>tive logistic regressions, avoiding the &quot;parallel lines&quot; <lb/>assumption, employed by ordinal logit models, that all <lb/>coefficients except for intercepts are the same across mul-<lb/>tiple regressions (Williams, 2016). This assumption is <lb/>often problematic when respondents assess their own <lb/>well-being, as it would assume that the effect of a vari-<lb/>able would necessarily have the same impact on an indi-<lb/>vidual choosing a neutral response (e.g., selecting that <lb/>they are &quot;OK&quot; over &quot;bad&quot;) as it would on an individual <lb/>choosing a positive response (e.g., selecting that they are <lb/>&quot;great&quot; over &quot;OK&quot;) (Cracolici et al., 2013; Harzing, 2016). <lb/>The difference between the two-stage ELR used here <lb/>and the GOLM approach is that the latter relies on a <lb/>maximum likelihood approach, the assumptions of which <lb/>are inappropriate for two conditions that occur within <lb/>my data: (1) smaller data sets and (2) some variable com-<lb/>binations (i.e., cell counts) having few or no observations <lb/>(Faghih et al., 2020; Gao &amp; Shen, 2007; King &amp; <lb/>Ryan, 2002; Mehta &amp; Patel, 1995; Quintero et al., 2007). <lb/>ELRs produce more accurate inferences under these con-<lb/>ditions because the approach does not use maximum <lb/>likelihood; rather, the estimate of each variable is sepa-<lb/>rately calculated while conditioning out all the other <lb/>explanatory variables (Giannakis &amp; Bruggeman, 2015). <lb/>ELR is computationally intensive, making it infeasi-<lb/>ble to include multiple explanatory variables for anything <lb/>other than the smallest datasets (Quintero et al., 2007). <lb/>Therefore, to allow for the inclusion of potentially impor-<lb/>tant explanatory benefits, I generated 148 different ELR <lb/>models representing all combinations of potential explan-<lb/>atory variables (each of the six direct variables <lb/>individually, and variable pairs of each of the direct vari-<lb/>ables regressed with each other and 16 alternate explana-<lb/>tory variables 5 ). 6 <lb/>3.5.1 | Addressing &quot;missing&quot; data <lb/>The various benefit categories received differing response <lb/>rates. To ensure that the findings of the study were not <lb/>unduly influenced by different levels of nonresponses, I <lb/>generated predicted responses and reran the paired <lb/>regressions discussed above. The findings from the pre-<lb/>dicted dataset were consistent with the findings <lb/>presented here. I therefore do not further discuss the <lb/>findings from the predicted dataset. Results and addi-<lb/>tional information regarding predicted responses are in <lb/>the Supporting Information. <lb/>4 | RESULTS <lb/>Two hundred and seventy-two people fully or substan-<lb/>tially completed the survey, although the number of <lb/>responses varied for each of the questions asked. Approx-<lb/>imately 42% of respondents answered that wildlife made <lb/>their lives better, 39% stated that wildlife made their lives <lb/>worse, and the remainder replied that their lives were <lb/>about the same (Table 1). <lb/>Respondents most frequently reported receiving one <lb/>or more of the following six direct benefit types: meat <lb/>(84.16%), funeral assistance (68.34%), cash benefits <lb/>(16.42%), conservancy employment (14.07%), tuition <lb/>assistance (13.66%), and business loans (7.77%) (the cash, <lb/>tuition, business loans, and employment benefits are col-<lb/>lectively referred to here as &quot;rare benefits&quot;). Approxi-<lb/>mately 28% of respondents identified receiving indirect <lb/>benefits in the form of infrastructure, such as access to <lb/>community vehicles or boreholes. <lb/>The &quot;other&quot; category of benefits received noticeably <lb/>fewer responses than did the rest of the benefit categories, <lb/>but of those individuals that answered this sub-question, <lb/>around 10% received some additional benefit. Written <lb/>comments on the surveys indicate that respondents <lb/>included in this category both direct benefits (e.g., seeds <lb/>for planting, construction materials, and food to individ-<lb/>uals in need) and indirect benefits (e.g., a community <lb/>school and funding for conservancy-based soccer teams). <lb/>Thus, for the purposes of this analysis, this category is <lb/>included in the model as an indirect category of benefits. <lb/>None of the direct or indirect benefits are highly cor-<lb/>related. However, some of the rare benefits do evidence <lb/>moderately positive correlation with each other <lb/>(Table 2). 7 <lb/></body>

        <body>4.1 | Analyses without alternative <lb/>explanatory variables <lb/>When no alternate explanatory variables were included, the <lb/>total number of benefit types received was positively and <lb/>significantly correlated with the likelihood that respondents <lb/>selected a more positive response about the impact of wild-<lb/>life on their lives (Table 3). 8 For each additional benefit type <lb/>received, respondents were approximately 23% more likely <lb/>to feel that wildlife at least had a neutral impact on their <lb/>lives (i.e., select either the &quot;about the same&quot; or &quot;better&quot; <lb/>choice) and 65% more likely to feel that wildlife made their <lb/>lives better. 9 However, the individual benefit types varied <lb/>widely in the direction, magnitude, and significance of their <lb/>respective relationship with respondents&apos; perceptions. <lb/>When each of the benefits were individually regressed <lb/>with the outcome measure, the employment, funeral, <lb/>and meat benefits all had significant, positive associations <lb/>with the respondents&apos; perceptions.

        <body>the likelihood that a resident feels that wildlife makes <lb/>her life better. However, the findings in this study suggest <lb/>that different benefit types may vary greatly in their indi-<lb/>vidual influence on residents&apos; perceptions, with some <lb/>individual benefit types even potentially undermining <lb/>recipients&apos; attitudes toward wildlife. <lb/>The data also fails to support Prediction 2 (direct <lb/>monetary benefits in the form of wages or cash distribu-<lb/>tions will have a greater positive impact than direct non-<lb/>monetary benefits), but these findings warrant additional <lb/>discussion, as it appears that the form of the payment <lb/>may matter. The receipt of cash or tuition payments evi-<lb/>denced no statistically significant relationship with peo-<lb/>ple&apos;s opinions of the impact of wildlife on their lives, <lb/>while those who received business loans were signifi-<lb/>cantly less likely to feel that wildlife at least had a neutral <lb/>impact. But, by contrast, respondents in households <lb/>receiving conservancy wages were over three times more <lb/>likely to feel that wildlife made their lives better, and <lb/>recipients of funeral benefits (which include both meat <lb/>and money) were over two times more likely to perceive <lb/>both that wildlife had a neutral and positive impact on <lb/>their lives. Interestingly, my findings suggest that the <lb/>receipt of trophy meat may have had the greatest and <lb/>most consistent impact on participants&apos; views of wildlife. <lb/>Across all variable pairs, recipients of meat benefits were <lb/>approximately three times and four times more likely to <lb/>feel that wildlife had either a neutral or beneficial effect, <lb/>respectively, on their lives. <lb/>The large, positive association of the funeral and <lb/>employment benefits is perhaps unsurprising. Pre-survey <lb/>interviewees stated that funeral benefits provide both <lb/>meat and cash benefits. As such, they likely represent a <lb/>social service that can be directly attributed to wildlife-<lb/>both via the game meat provided and the payment of <lb/>money by the conservancy, which exists to collect and <lb/>manage wildlife-generated income. Absent these funeral <lb/>benefits, the families of the deceased would presumably <lb/>have to rely exclusively on their own resources to feed <lb/>funeral guests and cover any associated funeral costs. <lb/>Thus, funeral assistance likely represents significant eco-<lb/>nomic value-the gift of which is strongly linked to <lb/>wildlife-at a time when the household may be most in <lb/>need of financial, logistical, and emotional support. <lb/>Regarding the employment benefit, jobs in many CBC <lb/>areas are scarce and any form of employment is highly <lb/>coveted (Gosling et al., 2017; Naidoo, Fisher, et al., 2016). <lb/>Thus, individuals who have secured conservancy employ-<lb/>ment are highly likely to feel like their lives have signifi-<lb/>cantly improved. Since the employment is through the <lb/>conservancy, which was created for the purpose of govern-<lb/>ing wildlife, those individuals are also likely to attribute <lb/>the employment to the existence of wildlife. <lb/>The negative or non-significant association of some <lb/>cash benefits in this study, on the other hand, is unex-<lb/>pected, although not entirely unprecedented. For <lb/>instance, the percentage of direct household wildlife ben-<lb/>efits in Botswana was not correlated with positive atti-<lb/>tudes toward wildlife (Parry &amp; Campbell, 1992). The <lb/>receipt of either cash or employment benefits in <lb/>Namibia&apos;s Zambezi region was not associated with any <lb/>sizeable or significant change in participants&apos; support for <lb/>their conservancy (Muyengwa, 2015). 10 Finally, individ-<lb/>uals in Indonesia directly benefiting from tourism to a <lb/>nearby national park voiced lower than expected support <lb/>for conservation of the park (Walpole &amp; Goodwin, 2002). <lb/>Still, each of the business loans, tuition, and cash bene-<lb/>fits has tangible monetary value, and the bulk of the field <lb/>literature discussed in the predictions section suggests that <lb/>they should therefore be expected to have a significant, <lb/>positive correlation with recipients&apos; views of wildlife. My <lb/>available data do not allow me to conclusively explain my <lb/>finding that some form of cash-based benefits may be <lb/>more effective than others. However, I present three possi-<lb/>ble explanations for this finding. 11 <lb/>First, participants&apos; perceptions may be the result of a <lb/>psychological phenomenon. It is generally observed that <lb/>individuals evaluate their well-being by comparing their <lb/>current circumstance to a subjectively derived standard <lb/>(McBride, 2010; Medvec et al., 1995). 12 Individuals that <lb/>perceive themselves better off than that benchmark are <lb/>more likely to be satisfied with their current situation, <lb/>while those perceiving themselves worse off are more <lb/>likely to feel dissatisfied (Castilla, 2012; Hafner <lb/>et al., 2016; McBride, 2010; Villano et al., 2020). <lb/>Individuals&apos; benchmarks can be based on factors such <lb/>as the individuals&apos; past experiences, the perceived circum-<lb/>stances of peers, or hypothetical scenarios (Castilla, 2012; <lb/>Epstude &amp; Roese, 2008; Hafner et al., 2016; <lb/>McBride, 2010; Roese &amp; Morrison, 2009). The use of these <lb/>psychological benchmarks appears to be universal, hav-<lb/>ing been observed across different countries and cultures <lb/>(Arkes et al., 2010; Epstude &amp; Roese, 2008; Gilovich <lb/>et al., 2016; Hafner et al., 2016). Individuals adjust these <lb/>standards over time in response to changes in circum-<lb/>stances and personal experiences (Arkes et al., 2010; <lb/>Bertoni &amp; Corazzini, 2015; Chao et al., 2017; <lb/>McBride, 2010; Mentzakis &amp; Moro, 2009; Van Hoeck <lb/>et al., 2015). <lb/>In this study, the lack of significance of several forms <lb/>of cash-based benefits may be the result of recipients feel-<lb/>ing that the benefits they received fell short of their own <lb/>subjective benchmarks. This feeling might arise in two <lb/>circumstances. <lb/>Benefit recipients may have experienced &quot;expectation <lb/>creep&quot; where, in response to the past receipt of a cash <lb/></body>

        <body>benefit, they adjusted their economic benchmarks <lb/>upwards and were consequently disappointed by the lack <lb/>or size of subsequent payments. Welch (2018) observed <lb/>expectation creep of this sort in Namibia&apos;s N#a-Jaqna <lb/>Conservancy, where a false rumor of additional benefit <lb/>payments caused residents to be dissatisfied with their <lb/>(usually well received) benefits. In my pre-survey inter-<lb/>views, multiple individuals indicated that cash benefits <lb/>had not been made in many years, and one traditional <lb/>authority specifically told me that the needs and expecta-<lb/>tions of residents had grown over that time. Thus, a simi-<lb/>lar sort of expectation creep might have been experienced <lb/>by participants in my study who had previously received <lb/>now discontinued cash benefits. <lb/>Cash recipients could also feel dissatisfied if they were <lb/>well-connected individuals who anticipated an even <lb/>greater payout from their conservancies. Elite capture is <lb/>an issue frequently observed in CBC communities <lb/>(Groom &amp; Harris, 2008; Lubilo &amp; Hebinck, 2019; <lb/>MacKenzie et al., 2017; Morton et al., 2016; Naidoo, <lb/>Weaver, et al., 2016) and my data suggest that it may be <lb/>occurring in my project&apos;s study area. Roughly half <lb/>(49.98%) of the recipients of one rare benefit in my <lb/>response group received at least one additional rare bene-<lb/>fit, as opposed to the 12.46% of recipients that should be <lb/>expected to have received two rare benefits if distribution <lb/>was truly random. In their survey responses, most <lb/>respondents indicated that they believed that favoritism <lb/>was occurring within the conservancies, as did some par-<lb/>ticipants in pre-survey interviews (Cruise and Sasada <lb/>(2021) reported similar complaints of favoritism). To the <lb/>extent that elite capture is occurring in the study area, it <lb/>could be that well-connected individuals may have antici-<lb/>pated receiving a much greater magnitude of benefits and <lb/>were disappointed when they received smaller-<lb/>than-expected payments. <lb/>A second possible explanation for this study&apos;s findings <lb/>(that meat benefits had a positive relationship with per-<lb/>ceptions of wildlife while most of the monetary benefits <lb/>did not) is that meat may have particular socio-cultural <lb/>resonance with recipients. Multiple studies across sub-<lb/>Saharan Africa observe that meat has both symbolic and <lb/>dietary significance. Meat is considered by many to be an <lb/>integral part of a meal (Erasmus &amp; Hoffman, 2017), and <lb/>its consumption is associated with celebration, wealth, <lb/>and hospitality (Asamane et al., 2021). Livestock are con-<lb/>sidered monetary assets and important symbols of <lb/>wealth, so consumption of those animals can be reserved <lb/>for special occasions or to feed important visitors <lb/>(Bundala et al., 2020). Hunting has traditionally occurred <lb/>in the study area, especially as a supplemental food <lb/>source during times of scarcity (Jacobsohn, 1995; Morais <lb/>et al., 2015). Wildlife meat is also valued by inhabitants <lb/>of the study area for its taste (depending on the species) <lb/>and because of the perception that it is healthier due to <lb/>being free of harmful chemicals (Crandall, 2002; Morais <lb/>et al., 2015). <lb/>Thus, distributions of game meat may represent a <lb/>meaningful form of wealth distribution to recipients, and <lb/>the provision of that meat at funerals could have impor-<lb/>tant social significance, while also mitigating the need for <lb/>the family to utilize its own livestock resources. Regular <lb/>meat distributions may therefore be perceived by recipi-<lb/>ents in my study as imbuing greater total wealth than the <lb/>occasional monetary payment. <lb/>A third possible explanation of this study&apos;s findings is <lb/>that employment, trophy meat, and funeral benefits may <lb/>have a more obvious link to wildlife than the cash, loans, <lb/>and tuition benefits. Meat distributions come from wild-<lb/>life hunted within the conservancies, and employment <lb/>directly involves the governance of the conservancies&apos; <lb/>wildlife resources, including occupations such as game <lb/>guards or lion spotters. <lb/>By contrast, the direct link with wildlife is less obvi-<lb/>ous for tuition, business loans, and cash benefits. While <lb/>the benefits are distributed through the conservancy, it <lb/>may be unclear to many recipients whether the money <lb/>for those payments was derived directly from wildlife or <lb/>from other outside sources of funding (e.g. from govern-<lb/>mental or non-governmental sources). As such, it may be <lb/>that recipients of non-employment cash benefits are less <lb/>likely to associate the positive impacts of those benefits <lb/>with wildlife and are consequently less likely to feel that <lb/>wildlife has a positive impact on their lives. <lb/>6 | CONCLUSIONS <lb/>At minimum, my findings indicate that perceptions sur-<lb/>rounding wildlife-generated benefits are complex. Partici-<lb/>pants may attribute greater or lesser importance to <lb/>particular benefit types than is traditionally assumed in <lb/>the design of payment-based conservation programs, <lb/>where it is taken for granted that monetary payouts will <lb/>have the greatest possible impact. The impact of mone-<lb/>tary and non-monetary benefits on community support <lb/>for wildlife conservation likely depends on a host of dif-<lb/>ferent factors, including but not limited to the frequency <lb/>and timing of benefit distributions, relevant social factors, <lb/>and how easily the benefits are linked to wildlife. <lb/>The findings presented here give rise to two key prac-<lb/>tical recommendations. First, the form of direct monetary <lb/>benefits likely matters. Meyer and Börner (2022) previ-<lb/>ously found that monetary distributions in the form of <lb/>compensation payments may not materially change <lb/>recipients&apos; perceptions of CBC among those that have <lb/></body>

        <body>experienced HWC. My findings suggest that other forms <lb/>of monetary payments may also be highly variable, or <lb/>even counterproductive, at positively influencing recipi-<lb/>ent perceptions. Policymakers should carefully consider <lb/>and evaluate the effectiveness of the specific forms of <lb/>monetary benefits distributed within CBC communities. <lb/>Second, cultural considerations likely play an impor-<lb/>tant role in determining which and when benefits are more <lb/>effective. In the study area for this paper, meat benefits are <lb/>significantly and positively correlated with recipients&apos; per-<lb/>ceptions of whether they benefit from wildlife. It is proba-<lb/>bly no coincidence that residents in that area have been <lb/>found to have a positive view of bushmeat consumption. <lb/>However, other studies have found that bushmeat con-<lb/>sumption can be highly variable based on tribe, nationality, <lb/>and religion (e.g., Ceppi &amp; Nielsen, 2014; East et al., 2005). <lb/>Therefore, while meat benefits appear to be highly effective <lb/>in my study area, their efficacy elsewhere may depend on <lb/>the socio-cultural makeup of the target community. <lb/>Further research is warranted into how, why, and the <lb/>degree to which benefit types may relate to CBC resi-<lb/>dents&apos; perceptions of whether they benefit from wildlife, <lb/>so that benefit design and distribution can be tailored to <lb/>specific CBC projects. For instance, understanding the <lb/>role of benefit frequency on efficacy could inform the <lb/>form and timing of benefit distributions. Research into <lb/>how, if at all, recipients use psychological benchmarks to <lb/>evaluate their benefits could influence communication <lb/>regarding benefit distributions and facilitate the active <lb/>management of community expectations. <lb/></body>

        <div type="endnote">ENDNOTES <lb/>1 CBC can also be used to refer to the community-based manage-<lb/>ment of other natural resources, such as water, fish, or forests. <lb/>For purposes of simplicity, in this paper the term refers only to <lb/>wildlife-based CBC programs. <lb/>2 Meyer and Börner (2022) found that &quot;additional benefits&quot; (other <lb/>than compensation payments) were positively associated with <lb/>conservation efforts. The authors, however, included both cash <lb/>and unspecified &quot;in-kind&quot; payments in this category. <lb/>3 I do, however, turn to some of this literature when introducing <lb/>potential explanations for my findings. <lb/>4 Funeral assistance generally consists of game meat along with an <lb/>additional small cash payment to help defray funeral costs. <lb/>5 Computational limitations required that I create individual <lb/>models for each of four ethnicity and five conservancy selections. <lb/>Further explanation of these models can be found in the Support-<lb/>ing Information. <lb/>6 The use of multiple individual models gives rise to concerns <lb/>about a multiple hypothesis problem. Unfortunately, the same <lb/>limitation (smaller data set) that requires me to use exact logistic <lb/>regression also constrains my ability to correct for multiple <lb/>hypothesis. Existing approaches protect against Type I errors <lb/>(false positives) at the expense of statistical power and an <lb/>increased likelihood of Type II errors (false negatives) <lb/>(Nakagawa, 2004). Given the number of models used here, multi-<lb/>ple hypothesis testing would render it virtually impossible to find <lb/>any significant relationships at all. In effect, I would be selecting <lb/>a virtual certainty of at least one Type II error over the unknown <lb/>likelihood of a Type I error, and my findings would actually be <lb/>more likely to be biased. <lb/>As an admittedly imperfect substitute for correcting for multiple <lb/>hypotheses, I instead analyzed the data using traditional ordinal <lb/>logit models, one for each of the benefit types individually and <lb/>one that included all the benefit types and alternate explanatory <lb/>variables. The direction and, for the most part, the significance of <lb/>the relationships between the benefit types and the outcome vari-<lb/>able were the same for both approaches, although the two <lb/>approaches differed regarding the magnitude of the observed <lb/>relationships. A comparison of the results using the traditional <lb/>ordinal logit models with those presented herein can be found in <lb/>the Supporting Information. <lb/>7 Fitz-Gibbon and Morris (1987) suggest describing correlation <lb/>coefficients from 0.0 to 0.2 as &quot;probably no correlation,&quot; from 0.2 <lb/>to 0.4 as &quot;weak correlation,&quot; and 0.4-0.6 as &quot;moderately positive <lb/>correlation.&quot; <lb/>8 Table 3 (as does Table 4, below) reflects the likelihood that <lb/>respondents will select a higher level than the current one. Thus, <lb/>for instance, an odds ratio value greater than &quot;1&quot; for level À1 <lb/></div>

        <div type="annex">(wildlife makes my life worse) indicates an increased likelihood <lb/>that a respondent will select either 0 (about the same) or 1 (makes <lb/>my life better). That same odds ratio value for level 0 (about the <lb/>same) indicates an increased likelihood that a respondent would <lb/>select 1 (wildlife makes my life better). <lb/>9 The odds ratio refers to the likelihood of a unit change in an out-<lb/>come measure for every unit change in the variable of interest. <lb/>Here, the odds ratio refers to the likelihood of a unit increase <lb/>(from À1 to 0 or from 0 to 1) in whether respondents feel that <lb/>wildlife makes their lives better given a unit change in a benefits <lb/>variable. It should be noted that the percent change refers to the <lb/>percent by which the baseline odds change, not the magnitude of <lb/>that change. <lb/>10 Muyengwa&apos;s survey asked about support for conservancies, <lb/>rather than perceptions of wildlife. Consequently, the responses <lb/>in that study may be shaped by non-wildlife-related factors such <lb/>as corruption, conservancy responsiveness (or lack thereof) to <lb/>constituent concerns, or perceived favoritism in conservancy gov-<lb/>ernance. Still, Namibia&apos;s conservancies are designed to allow resi-<lb/>dents to utilize and benefit from their wildlife resources, so it is <lb/>likely that participants&apos; views of their conservancies are related, <lb/>at least in part, to whether they feel they personally benefit from <lb/>wildlife. <lb/>11 As discussed in the Predictions section, the findings in Meyer and <lb/>Börner (2022) suggest that monetary compensation payments may <lb/>materially differ in their impact from other &quot;in-kind&quot; cash pay-<lb/>ments (although that article combines both cash and other unspe-<lb/>cified in-kind benefits). Unfortunately, I conducted this survey <lb/>prior to the publication of that article, so my data does not differ-<lb/>entiate whether recipients of cash payments received them in the <lb/>form of compensation and/or as some other form of payment. A <lb/>review of the raw data from my survey, however, does not identify <lb/>any facially clear pattern involving whether individuals applied <lb/>for compensation and/or received cash and their opinions as to <lb/>whether wildlife makes their lives better. Therefore, while this dis-<lb/>tinction may be important and certainly warrants future investiga-<lb/>tion, I do not further discuss it here. <lb/>12 These standards are often referred to as &quot;counterfactuals&quot; in the <lb/>psychological literature (Epstude &amp; Roese, 2008; Roese &amp; <lb/>Morrison, 2009) and &quot;reference points&quot; in economic writings <lb/>(Castilla, 2012; McBride, 2010). <lb/></div>
