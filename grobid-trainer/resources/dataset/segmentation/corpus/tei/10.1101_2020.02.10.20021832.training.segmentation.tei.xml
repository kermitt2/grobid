			<body>Introduction <lb/>2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was discovered due to viral pneumonia cases in <lb/>Wuhan in 2019, was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 10 January 2020. The <lb/>main source of infection is pneumonia patients infected by new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets <lb/>are the main route of transmission and it can also be transmitted through contact. People are <lb/>generally susceptible. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and <lb/>immune status of patients with 2019-nCoV are still unclear. 1 This study intends to detect the <lb/>peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients with 2019-nCoV infection by <lb/>using four-color immunoflow cytometry and multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence to <lb/>investigate the cellular immunity status and cytokine levels of 2019-nCoV infected patients, to <lb/>explore the correlation between cellular immune statuses, cytokine levels and the severity of 2019-<lb/>nCoV infection. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Patients <lb/>From January 26, 2019 to February 4, 2020, 123 inpatients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV <lb/>infection were collected in the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital. All patients were <lb/>confirmed to be positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. Patients <lb/>were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided <lb/>into mild and severe (including severe and critical) groups <lb/>Blood sampling <lb/>Blood samples of the patients were collected by the nurse according to the doctor&apos;s order, and <lb/>all patients were not treated before the blood sampling or did not receive the standardized treatment <lb/>according to the diagnosis and treatment scheme of NCP. <lb/>Lymphocyte subsets detection <lb/>Two test tubes were taken for each patient, and were numbered A and B respectively. 5 μL of <lb/>CD3/ CD8/ CD45/ CD4 antibody (Beijing Tongshengshidai Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was added to <lb/>the tube A and 5 μL of CD16 + 56/ CD45/ CDl9 antibody was added to tube B. After adding 50 μL <lb/>of EDTA anticoagulant whole blood to each tube, the tubes were vortexed and kept at room <lb/>temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. Then the samples were detected by four-color fluorescence <lb/>labeled flow cytometry (Mindray BriCyte E6; Mindray, Shenzhen, China). <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>Cytokine detection <lb/>The detection reagent of cytokine was provided by Qingdao Raisecare Biotechnology Co., Ltd <lb/>(calibrator lot number: 20190801). Six cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF and IFN <lb/>were detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>instructions. After the blood sample and the corresponding flow tube be numbered 101, 102, 103, <lb/>104, and 105, EDTA-K2 anticoagulant whole blood was centrifuged at 2365 r / min for 30 min. <lb/>Then 25 μL of experimental buffer, 25 μL of centrifuged plasma, 25 μL of capture microsphere <lb/>antibody, and 25 μL of detection antibody were added to the corresponding flow tube. After <lb/>incubating at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark with gentle shaking, 25 μL SA-PE was added <lb/>into the flow tube respectively, and then incubation was continued for 30 minutes. Subsequently, <lb/>the diluted wash buffer (1:10) was added to the flow tube. After a few seconds of vortex shaking, <lb/>the flow tube was centrifuged at 1500r / min for 5 minutes, the liquid was slowly poured out, and <lb/>the flow tube was inverted on the absorbent paper. Then 100 μL of diluted washing buffer (1:10) <lb/>was added to the flow tube according to the requirements of the flow cytometer, and the test was <lb/>performed after shaking for 10 seconds. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). <lb/>Descriptive analyses were performed for categorical variables such as gender. Continuous variables <lb/>such as inspection results were expressed as x ± s and compared using the independent samples t-<lb/>test. Correlation analysis results were expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and a larger r 2 <lb/>indicates better linear correlation. P&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. <lb/>Ethics approval <lb/>This study was approved by the ethical committee of Chongqing Three Gorges Central <lb/>Hospital and informed consent was obtained from each patient. <lb/>Results <lb/>Baseline data <lb/>The study population included 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCP. 102 NCP <lb/>patients (55 males and 47 females) with a mean age of 43.05 ± 13.12 (15~82) years in the mild <lb/>group and 21 NCP patients (11 males and 10 females) with a mean age of 61.29±15.55 (34~79) <lb/>years in the severe group were enrolled. <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of NCP patients <lb/>According to the results of each index, CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + <lb/>T were divided into below normal value, within normal value and above normal value. The <lb/>corresponding quantities and proportions were respectively calculated, and the results were shown <lb/>in Table 1. <lb/>Among the mild patients, 54 (52.90%) patients had CD4 + T below normal values, 48 (47.10%) <lb/>were within normal values; 73 (71.60%) patients had CD8 + T within normal values, and 29 (28.40%) <lb/>were lower than normal; 26 (25.49%) patients had B cell lower than normal, 75 (73.50%) were <lb/>within normal, 1 (0.01%) was higher than normal; 35 (34.31%) patients had NK cell below normal <lb/>values, 66 cases (64.71%) were within normal values, 1 case (0.01%) was higher than normal values; <lb/>95 patients (93.14%) had CD4 + T / CD8 + T within normal values, 3 cases (2.94%) were lower <lb/>than normal, 4 cases (3.92%) were higher than normal values. <lb/>In severe patients, CD4 + T was lower than normal in 20 patients (95.24%), within normal in <lb/>1 patient (4.76%); CD8 + T was lower than normal in 13 patients (61.90%), within normal in 8 <lb/>patients (38.10%); B cell was lower than normal in 6 patients (28.57%), within normal in 15 patients <lb/>(71.43%); NK cell was lower than normal in 10 patients (47.62%), and within normal in 11 patients <lb/>(52.10%) 38%, 18 (85.71%) patients had CD4 + / CD8 + ratio within the normal value, 2 (9.53%) <lb/>patients were lower than the normal value, 1 (4.76%) was higher than the normal value. <lb/>Cytokines in peripheral blood of NCP patients <lb/>IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF, and IFN were divided into values of 0, within the normal value <lb/>(normal values other than 0), and above the normal value according to the results of various <lb/>indicators. The corresponding quantities and proportions were counted (Table 2). <lb/>Among the mild patients, 102 (100%) patients had IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 all within normal <lb/>values; 57 (55.88%) patients had IL-6 values of 0 and 14 (13.73%) within normal values, 31 <lb/>(30.39%) were higher than normal; 100 (98.04%) patients had TFN values within normal values, 2 <lb/>(1.96%) were higher than normal values; 92 (90.20%) patients had IFN within the normal values, 5 <lb/>cases (4.90%) had IFN values of 0, and 5 cases (4.90%) were higher than normal values. <lb/>In severe patients, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF were all within the normal values in 21 (100%) <lb/>patients; IL-6 was 0 in 3 patients (14.29%), 2 patients (9.52%) were within the normal values, 16 <lb/>patients (76.19%) were higher than the normal values; IFN was within the normal values in 20 <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>patients (95.24%), and 1 patient (4.76%) was higher than the normal values. <lb/>Correlation between lymphocyte subsets and IL-6 in NCP patients <lb/>Considering that the value of IL-6 changed most in the mild and severe groups, the correlation <lb/>between the lymphocyte subsets and the cytokine IL-6 was analyzed. The data with IL-6 value of 0 <lb/>in each group (57 cases in light group and 3 cases in severe group) were excluded, and 45 cases in <lb/>the mild group and 18 cases in severe group were included in the correlation analysis. As shown in <lb/>Table 3, the correlation analysis between IL-6 and lymphocyte subsets showed that the Pearson <lb/>correlation coefficients of IL-6 and CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + T were <lb/>very low, and there was no significant linear correlation. <lb/>Comparison of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood between patients with mild <lb/>and severe NCP <lb/>The data (57 cases of IL-6 and 3 cases of IFN in the mild group) with the index value of 0 in <lb/>the two groups were excluded. Two independent-samples t test was performed on the lymphocyte <lb/>subsets and cytokines of the mild group and the severe group, with α= 0.05 as the inspection level. <lb/>Significant differences were observed in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 between the mild group <lb/>and the severe group (P &lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in B cell, NK cell, <lb/>CD4 + T / CD8 + T, IL-4, IL-17, TNF, IFN between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05, Table 4). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body&apos;s cellular immune regulation, and each <lb/>cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate <lb/>of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction <lb/>rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating <lb/>that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV <lb/>infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen 2 in SARS coronavirus, <lb/>revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus <lb/>infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe <lb/>group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for <lb/>34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV <lb/>infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune <lb/>adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>ideas and evidence for clinical treatment. 3 <lb/>Chaolin Huang et al. 4 showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-<lb/>1, MIP-1A were significantly higher in 2019-nCoV infected patients in ICU than those in non-ICU <lb/>patients, and the incidence of ARDS, secondary infection, shock, acute heart, and kidney injury was <lb/>significantly higher in patients with ICU than in non-ICU patients. The results of this study indicated <lb/>that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and <lb/>IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild <lb/>and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and <lb/>30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains <lb/>to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity <lb/>in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the <lb/>severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the <lb/>concept of &quot;Cytokine Storm&quot;, which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become <lb/>severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In <lb/>addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital <lb/>noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain <lb/>significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease. <lb/>The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between <lb/>lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and <lb/>cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, <lb/>CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting <lb/>that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which <lb/>was consistent with the opinions of many experts. 5, 6 For several results of this study, for example, <lb/>the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there <lb/>was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of <lb/>patients, both B cell and NK cell decreased in different degrees in two groups of patients, the <lb/>possible reasons are as follows. (1)The conclusion of this study is a true reflection of the <lb/>characteristics of 2019-nCoV itself; (2) In the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection, due to the strong <lb/>variability and good concealment of the virus, it cannot be quickly recognized by the body; (3) <lb/>2019-nCoV releases certain special factors after entering the body and interferes with the body&apos;s <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>initiation of a specific immune response; (4) Other reasons that have not yet been confirmed. <lb/>This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for <lb/>patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample <lb/>size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some <lb/>impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the <lb/>middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively <lb/>reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there <lb/>was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale <lb/>outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank <lb/>controls. <lb/>In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further <lb/>explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with <lb/>2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to <lb/>carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the <lb/>sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen <lb/>the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient&apos;s peripheral <lb/>blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. <lb/></body>
