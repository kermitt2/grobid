Pérez 3,4 <lb/>Identifying accurate topographic variations associated with volcanic eruptions plays a key role in <lb/>obtaining information on eruptive parameters, volcano structure, input data for volcano processes <lb/>modelling, and civil protection and recovery actions. The 2021 eruption of Cumbre Vieja volcano is <lb/>the largest eruptive event in the recorded history for La Palma Island. Over the course of almost 3 <lb/>months, the volcano produced profound morphological changes in the landscape affecting both the <lb/>natural and the anthropic environment over an area of tens of km 2 . We present the results of a UAS <lb/>(Unoccupied Aircraft System) survey consisting of &gt;12,000 photographs coupled with Structure-<lb/>from-Motion photogrammetry that allowed us to produce a very-high-resolution (0.2 m/pixel) <lb/>Digital Surface Model (DSM). We characterised the surface topography of the newly formed volcanic <lb/>landforms and produced an elevation difference map by differencing our survey and a pre-event surface, <lb/>identifying morphological changes in detail. The present DSM, the first one with such a high resolution <lb/>to our knowledge, represents a relevant contribution to both the scientific community and the <lb/>local authorities. <lb/></front>

			<body>Background &amp; Summary <lb/>The morphology of active volcanoes is dynamically shaped by eruptive activity and erosional processes acting <lb/>at different timescales. Consequently, a precise digital elevation model is fundamental for mapping volcanic <lb/>hazards, modelling volcanic processes, and complementing further analysis. Furthermore, in urbanised areas, <lb/>detailed post-eruption topography is important for land recovery actions. Volcano morphologies can be quan-<lb/>tified using different techniques 1-9 . Recently, the increased capability of UASs and their applications for aerial <lb/>observation 10,11 , together with the parallel development of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) process 12 , brought <lb/>important and valuable advantages compared to the classical ground-based, satellite, and crewed aircraft sur-<lb/>veys. Nowadays, UAS-based photogrammetry is routinely applied on volcanoes to obtain very-high-resolution <lb/>DSMs 13-16 . <lb/>Cumbre Vieja is the active volcanic rift on La Palma and has seen the largest number of eruptions of the <lb/>Canary archipelago in historic times 17 , and its 2021 eruption was the largest eruptive event in recorded his-<lb/>tory for La Palma. The previous eruption occurred in the southern part of the island between September and <lb/>November 1971. The 2021 eruption was preceded by an unrest phase characterised by increased ground defor-<lb/>mation starting from 2009 18 , increased seismicity from 2017 19-22 , and detection of geochemical anomalies from <lb/>2010 23 . A dramatic evolution of the seismicity began on 11 September 2021 with a seismic swarm characterised <lb/>by an upward migration of the hypocentres reflecting the rising of magma towards the surface. <lb/>The volcanic eruption at Cumbre Vieja started on September 19, interrupting its 50-years-long period of <lb/>quiescence, and lasted until December 13 (85 days and 8 hours 24 ). During this period, the volcanic activity <lb/></body>

			<body>was distributed along a fissure where a multiple-vents volcanic edifice formed (called &quot;Volcán de Tajogaite&apos;&apos;). <lb/>The explosive activity was characterised by alternating strombolian explosions and lava fountaining episodes, <lb/>accompanied by abundant lava effusion. All such phenomena produced profound morphological changes in <lb/>the landscape and severely affected settlements and industry. A total of about 12 km 2 of territory, more than <lb/>1,600 buildings and 200 hectares of banana plantations (the island&apos;s main economic resource after tourism), and <lb/>important infrastructures (roads, powerlines, waterlines, etc.) were buried and destroyed by lava flows in their <lb/>6-km-long-path to the ocean. Here they expanded into two lava deltas, forming new land. In addition, the tephra <lb/>fallout further affected the whole island and, to a smaller extent, the nearby islands of El Hierro, La Gomera and <lb/>Tenerife. <lb/>Here, we present the results of a UAS survey carried out between 24 and 28 January 2022 using a DJI Phantom <lb/>4 RTK (real-time kinematic). The aerial images were georeferenced using an onboard RTK receiver capable of <lb/>cm-level positioning accuracy. The dataset was then processed using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogram-<lb/>metry and 40 Ground Control Points (GCPs) acquired between 23 and 27 January using the Differential Global <lb/>Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) positioning. This allowed us to achieve horizontal and vertical centimetre <lb/>accuracy and to produce a very-high-resolution (0.2 m/pixel) Digital Surface Model (DSM) and orthophotomo-<lb/>saic (0.1 m/pixel), covering an area of about 17 km 2 . <lb/>Topographic change detection was obtained by differencing our survey and a pre-event (2015) 2m-pixel <lb/>DTM 25 , thus identifying elevation changes at decimetre level precision. We characterised the whole topography <lb/>of the new volcanic edifice and related lava field to detect elevation, areal, and volume variations. <lb/>Summary of the main findings: <lb/>• Subaerial deposit of lava flows and proximal fallout: volume 217.4 ± 6.6 Mm 3 (voids in the lava field and sub-<lb/>merged portion of the two deltas are not considered), subaerial deposition rate 29.5 m 3 /s. In a previous survey <lb/>carried out on 27/9, 35.8 ± 3.0 Mm 3 and 59.2 m 3 /s were recorded 26 . Moreover, considering the volume differ-<lb/>ence between the 27/09 survey 26 and the post-event survey, the resulting subaerial deposition rate is 27.2 m 3 /s. <lb/>• Volcanic edifice: volume 36.5 ± 0.3 Mm 3 (8.9 ± 0.2 Mm 3 on 27/9 26 ); surface 0.6 km 2 ; major and minor axes <lb/>of the cone, calculated along the main eruptive fracture, approximately 770 (N 140°) and 660 m, respectively; <lb/>maximum elevation difference 187 m; maximum height 1071.2 m a.s.l. <lb/>• Subaerial lava flows: volume 177.6 ± 5.8 Mm 3 (including fallout deposit on lava flows); surface 11.8 km 2 <lb/>(deltas 0.48 km 2 ); maximum and average thickness 65 and 15.2 m, respectively; effusion rate 24.1 m 3 /s (sub-<lb/>merged volume of lava deltas is not considered). <lb/>The present DSM represents a relevant contribution to both the scientific community and the authorities in <lb/>charge of the restoration activities management. <lb/>Methods <lb/>UAS survey and DSM generation. We conducted a photographic survey campaign (Fig. 1 and Table 1) <lb/>between 24 and 28 January 2022, collecting multiple sets of UAS-based high-resolution imagery. We acquired <lb/>over 12000 aerial pictures using a DJI Phantom 4 RTK UAS with a 1&quot; CMOS 20MP and a field of view (FOV) 84° <lb/>and 8,8 mm/24 mm (35 mm equivalent) focal length lens. <lb/>A total of 10 multi-flight missions were conducted for the survey, for a cumulative flight path of over 800 km <lb/>(Fig. 1). All flights except two were nadir image data collection missions, conducted at an approximate altitude <lb/>of 200 metres above ground level (a.g.l.), resulting in a nominal ground-sampling-distance (GSD) of 5.4 cen-<lb/>timetres per-pixel. The 24 and 28 January 2022 flights carried out in the area of the cone were both nadir and <lb/>oblique image data collection missions conducted at a variable altitude of 50-200 metres a.g.l. For the nadir <lb/>flights, we flew the UAS using predefined missions. Flight planning was designed with 80% forward and side <lb/>overlap at ground level. Before each flight, we adjusted the camera&apos;s digital ISO, aperture, and shutter speed <lb/>according to ambient light conditions. <lb/>With respect to other terrains, several additional difficulties characterised the aerial photographic survey <lb/>campaign at Cumbre Vieja. The cone area has a highly irregular topography, characterised by notched cra-<lb/>ters and slopes. In addition, viewing conditions at Cumbre Vieja were still partially limited by the presence of <lb/>vapour/gas plumes and, at times, by atmospheric haze and clouds. <lb/>The data on camera position were collected using GNSS-RTK information embedded in the image metadata <lb/>by means of a DJI D-RTK 2 Mobile Station. In addition, 40 ground control points (GCPs) were distributed along <lb/>the outer boundary of the lava flow and in the cone area to establish survey control (Fig. 1). In detail, 33 points <lb/>were used as proper GCPs (i.e., used to georeference and scale the photogrammetric model and for camera <lb/>calibration purposes), whereas 7 points were used as checkpoints (i.e., not directly used in the photogrammetric <lb/>modelling process but available to check the accuracy of the generated model). GCPs were measured with a <lb/>GNSS survey using a DJI D-RTK 2 Mobile Station in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode, with differential correc-<lb/>tions sent in real-time by the Instituto Geográfico Nacional differential positioning service available at https:// <lb/>www.ign.es/web/ign/portal/gds-gnss-tiempo-real. The surveyed GCPs have an accuracy of 1-2 cm in horizontal <lb/>coordinates and 2-4 cm in elevation. <lb/>Following image collection, we culled the photoset, removing dark and/or blurry photos. We then pro-<lb/>cessed 9970 georeferenced images using the Agisoft Metashape ® software package (version 1.6.3) based on the <lb/>Structure-from-Motion and multi-view stereo photogrammetry algorithm (SfM-MVS) 12 . The workflow of our <lb/>photogrammetric analysis included the following: (1) image masking for areas with strong degassing and/or <lb/>unnecessary background; (2) camera triangulation with image position and orientation and generation of sparse <lb/>point cloud; (3) filtering of the sparse point cloud to remove points with bad geometry, large pixel matching <lb/>errors, and large pixel residual errors; (4) generation of the dense point cloud; (5) cleaning of the dense point <lb/></body>

			<body>cloud by using the &quot;filter by confidence&quot; tool and by manually removing anomalous floating points caused by the <lb/>presence of the volcanic plume; and (6) generation of DSMs and orthomosaics. We set the processing param-<lb/>eters in Agisoft Metashape ® to &quot;high&quot; for photo alignment accuracy and &quot;high&quot; quality and &quot;aggressive&quot; depth <lb/>filtering for dense point cloud generation. For the details of the photogrammetric survey data and elaboration <lb/>refer to Table 1. <lb/>We generated a 0.2 m/pixel DSM (Fig. 2) and a 0.1 m/pixel orthophotomosaic, covering an area of about 17 <lb/>km 2 . Unlike a digital elevation model (DEM), the DSM represents the elevation of the highest object within the <lb/>bounds of a cell. Vegetation, buildings, and other objects have not been removed from the data. <lb/>The dataset was processed and analysed in the REGCAN95/UTM zone 28 N [EPSG:4083] Coordinate <lb/>System. The transformation from ellipsoidal to orthometric heights has been performed using the Geoid model <lb/>EGM08-REDNAP (https://datos-geodesia.ign.es/geoide/). <lb/>Elevation change detection. Elevation change detection (Fig. 3) was obtained by differencing our surveys <lb/>and a pre-event 2m-pixel DTM acquired in 2015 for the Spanish PNOA-LiDAR project 25 . The assumption is that <lb/>between the acquisition of the pre-event DTM (2015) and the beginning of the volcanic activity (19 September <lb/>2021), no significant height variation took place in the study area, so that elevation differences obtained in our <lb/>analysis are mainly linked to the volcanic eruption. To subtract the post-and pre-event surveys, we resampled <lb/>our DSM to 2 m/pixel resolution (same resolution as the 2015 DTM).

			<body>Error (RMSE) of 0.26 m for our model (before resampling), we set the threshold elevation change (minimum level <lb/>of detection or minimum elevation change that can confidently be considered a true change) to 0.5 m. It is worth <lb/>mentioning that the pre-event reference surface is a DTM while our product is a DSM. Such difference must be <lb/>considered when subtracting both layers as height contributions from vegetation and buildings are still present <lb/>on the DSM. However, the contribution of such areas is negligible as they are not present above lava flows and <lb/>in the cone area. <lb/>Data Records <lb/>The data record consists of a high-resolution (0.2 m/pixel) photogrammetric Digital Surface Model processed <lb/>from survey campaign photographs using Agisoft Metashape ® . Details of the photogrammetric survey data <lb/>and elaboration are summarised in Table 1. The Digital Surface Model was processed and analysed in the <lb/>REGCAN95/UTM zone 28 N [EPSG:4083] Coordinate System. The dataset is stored in GeoTIFF file format in <lb/>the OpenTopography repository 27 and is shared under the CC BY 4.0 use license. <lb/>technical Validation <lb/>Errors in our photogrammetrically-generated DSM result from a complex interplay of geometric and physical <lb/>parameters, such as image scale, GSD, camera network geometry (nadiral, cross, oblique strips), percentages <lb/>of image overlap (forward and sidelap), camera shutter speed and exposure settings, lens specifications, image <lb/>sharpness, camera calibrations, flight design (e.g., flight-line geometry and altitude), surface texture and albedo, <lb/>lighting conditions, accuracy and distribution of GCPs, disturbances from volcanic activity, as well as on pro-<lb/>cessing: SfM, BBA, image matching, point cloud noise, and outlier removal algorithms. <lb/>We therefore applied several strategies to mitigate errors, among which the most important were the fol-<lb/>lowing: (1) the use of fast (&gt;1/400 s) camera shutter speeds (i.e., exposure times) whenever possible, (2) the <lb/>variation of flight altitudes and camera orientation, (3) the application of best practices for processing in Agisoft <lb/>Metashape, (e.g. 12 ), and (4) the removal of sparse cloud points with large uncertainty via Metashape&apos;s gradual <lb/>selection tools. <lb/>The technical quality of the reconstructed DSM was assessed by using the survey report generated by Agisoft <lb/>Metashape ® and by comparing our DSM to a pre-event DTM 25 . According to the Agisoft Metashape ® survey <lb/>report the GCPs and check points error estimates are as follows: the total GCPs Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) <lb/>Fig. 2 Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the 2021 eruption deposit of Cumbre Vieja volcano.
