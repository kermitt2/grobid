			<body>Dear Editor, <lb/>Stella (also known as PGC7 or Dppa3) was identified as <lb/>a highly expressed protein in primordial germ cells (PGC). <lb/>Expression of Stella is maintained throughout oocyte <lb/>maturation and persists into the preimplantation <lb/>embryos 1 . Stella knockout females display a strongly <lb/>reduced fertility due to the impaired developmental <lb/>competence of early embryos 2 . The potential involvement <lb/>of Stella in embryogenesis and generation of induced <lb/>pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been examined 3,4 . How-<lb/>ever, the effects of Stella on oocyte development, espe-<lb/>cially at cellular and molecular level, remain unknown. To <lb/>do this, we generated Stella mutant mice using the <lb/>CRISPR/Cas9 system (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Mice <lb/>carrying homozygous mutations were born alive in a <lb/>knockout line containing 153-bp deletion (Stella Δ ). We <lb/>confirmed the successful deletion of Stella in the mutant <lb/>mice by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1b). <lb/>Stella Δ females were infertile when crossed with mutant <lb/>males despite the ovulation of eggs with normal appear-<lb/>ance (Supplementary Fig. S1c-e). After fertilization, <lb/>Stella Δ embryos are compromised in the preimplantation <lb/>development and rarely reach the blastocyst stage (Sup-<lb/>plementary Fig. S1f-g), consistent with published data 2 . It <lb/>is worth noting that this truncated protein was absent in <lb/>the nucleus, but was still detectable in the cytoplasm of <lb/>Stella Δ zygotes based on immunostaining (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. S2, arrows). Recently, Shin et al., revealed that <lb/>maternal Stella is partially cleaved by the ubiquitin-<lb/>proteasome system and an N-terminal fragment remains <lb/>in the cytoplasm where it participates in vesicular traf-<lb/>ficking 5 . Therefore, our mutant mouse model may pro-<lb/>vide novel insights into Stella function compared to the <lb/>conventional knockout mice reported previously 6,7 . <lb/>Given that Stella modulates the epigenetic asymmetry in <lb/>zygotes, we asked whether Stella is also involved in the <lb/>establishment of DNA methylation during oogenesis. To <lb/>address this question, ovulated oocytes from Stella Δ and <lb/>wild-type (WT) mice were isolated, and then base-<lb/>resolution methylomes were generated using the bisul-<lb/>fite sequencing (BS-Seq) method for small samples <lb/>(Fig. 1a). We found that, in WT oocytes, the global DNA <lb/>methylation level was ~38%, as expected 8 . However, in <lb/>Stella Δ oocytes, the average methylation level was dra-<lb/>matically increased to ~68% (Fig. 1b-c). This extensive <lb/>elevation of DNA methylation was observed across all <lb/>genomic features examined, such as promoter, untrans-<lb/>lated region (UTR), CpG island (CGI), intron, exon, as <lb/>well as the major repetitive-elements (Fig. 1d-g; Supple-<lb/>mentary Fig. S3). Such a pattern indicates that the changes <lb/>in DNA methylation of Stella Δ oocytes are in general <lb/>universal throughout the entire genome. To gain a better <lb/>understanding of the altered methylation landscape, we <lb/>also conducted a search for differentially methylated <lb/>regions (DMRs) between WT and Stella Δ oocytes. In total, <lb/>21,036 DMRs were identified, of which 20,998 were <lb/>hypermethylated (hyper-DMRs; 99.8%) and only 38 were <lb/>hypomethylated (hypo-DMRs; 0.2%) (Fig. 1h; Supple-<lb/>mentary Table S1), showing a predominance of hyper-<lb/>DMRs. In the female germline, de novo methylation takes <lb/>place during the postnatal growth phase of oocytes. Stella <lb/>was shown to be able to inhibit recruitment of the DNA <lb/>methyltransferase, DNMT1, through the binding of <lb/>UHRF1 9 , which might be the critical pathway mediating <lb/></body>

			<body>the effects of Stella on methylation landscape in oocytes. <lb/>Together, our findings clearly suggest that Stella is a novel <lb/>and essential factor preventing excessive DNA methyla-<lb/>tion during oocyte development. <lb/>To track the effects of Stella on the DNA methylation of <lb/>parental genome, individual female and male pronuclei of <lb/>late-stage zygotes were isolated separately for genome-<lb/>wide profiling (Fig. 1a). Limited change was observed in <lb/>the methylation levels of maternal DNA between oocytes <lb/>and zygotes from WT mice, as expected 8 . However, <lb/>maternal DNA methylome is markedly demethylated <lb/>from oocytes (68%) to zygotes (55%) in Stella Δ mice <lb/>(Fig. 1b-c). In support of this, we found a significant <lb/>increase in 5hmC signal in the female pronuclei of Stella Δ <lb/>zygotes; whereas female pronuclei in WT zygotes showed <lb/>a much less intense 5hmC staining (Fig. 1i-j). These <lb/>results strongly indicate the active demethylation of <lb/>maternal genome during Stella Δ zygote development, <lb/>supportive of the model proposed by Wang et al., Naka-<lb/>mura et al., and Armouroux et al. 8,10 . TET3 is a critical <lb/>dioxygenase that catalyzes conversion of 5mC to 5hmC in <lb/>the paternal genome, while Stella could block TET3 <lb/>activity to maintain DNA methylation of the maternal <lb/>DNA 4,7 . Heavy demethylation of maternal genome in <lb/>Stella Δ zygotes was likely due to the TET3 gaining access <lb/>to female pronuclei. Next, in order to search for those <lb/>potential loci and genes whose methylation is protected <lb/>by Stella, we analyzed the difference in DNA methylation <lb/>level of 20 kb windows between oocyte and maternal <lb/>pronuclei from WT and Stella Δ mice, respectively. <lb/>Totally, 6388 genomic loci and 2203 genes were identified <lb/>(Fig. 1k-l; Supplementary Table S2), such as the <lb/>development-related genes Csmd1 (Fig. 1m), Zdhhc6, and <lb/>Erbb4 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Gene ontology (GO) <lb/>analysis further indicates that these genes are enriched in <lb/>the pathways that play important roles in nervous system <lb/>and metabolic process (Supplementary Fig. S4). <lb/>Interestingly, compared to WT zygotes, the average <lb/>methylation level of paternal genome in Stella Δ zygote was <lb/>increased significantly, although not dramatically <lb/>(Fig. 1b-c). More assays are needed to clarify this issue. <lb/>Cumulatively, our findings suggest that Stella participates <lb/>in the DNA methylation maintenance of maternal gen-<lb/>ome during mouse zygotic development. <lb/>On the other hand, we noticed that, although the DNA <lb/>demethylation has occurred, the average methylation level <lb/>of female pronuclei was still elevated in Stella Δ zygotes <lb/>when compared to WT zygotes (Fig. 1b-c). This obser-<lb/>vation prompted us to propose that such a high level of <lb/>maternal DNA methylation in Stella Δ zygotes was likely <lb/>originated from the global hypermethylation in oocytes. <lb/>To test this possibility, we evaluated the contribution of <lb/>different genomic features to the DNA hypermethylation <lb/>in Stella Δ oocytes and zygotes. Gain of methylation was <lb/>detected in all elements of Stella Δ oocytes, with the largest <lb/>proportion contributed by intergenic region (48%; Sup-<lb/>plementary Fig. S5a-b). Maternal genome of Stella Δ <lb/>zygotes displayed the similar pattern compared with their <lb/>WT counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S5a-b). Of note, <lb/>the extent of demethylation of distinct elements was <lb/>almost identical between oocytes and female pronuclei in <lb/>either WT or Stella Δ mice, as evidenced by similar <lb/>methylation patterns (Supplementary Fig. S5b-c). This <lb/>observation indicates that Stella has no preference for the <lb/>specific genomic regions when protecting maternal DNA <lb/>against demethylation in zygotes. Moreover, we found <lb/>that 91% of genes with hyper-DMR (621/680) identified in <lb/>maternal genome of Stella Δ zygotes were indeed inherited <lb/>from their oocytes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Altogether, <lb/>these data suggest that global hypermethylation across the <lb/>oocyte methylome in Stella Δ mice results in the higher <lb/>level of DNA methylation in female pronuclei than that in <lb/>WT mice. Considering that BS-Seq measures the sum of <lb/>5mC and 5hmC, and the strong 5hmC signals were <lb/>(see figure on previous page) <lb/>Fig. 1 Differing roles of Stella in the control of DNA methylation during oocyte and zygotic development. a Diagram illustrating the BS-seq <lb/>procedure for genome-wide methylation analysis.

			<body>detectable in Stella Δ pronuclei, more dramatic <lb/>DNA demethylation perhaps occurred during the transi-<lb/>tion from oocytes to zygote in Stella Δ mice. <lb/>In summary, by constructing a Stella mutant mouse <lb/>model, we identified Stella as a novel factor essential for <lb/>preventing excessive DNA methylation during oogenesis. <lb/>Following fertilization, Stella participates in the main-<lb/>tenance of maternal genome methylation during zygotic <lb/>development. After we submitted this manuscript, Li et al. <lb/>reported the function of Stella in safeguarding the oocyte <lb/>methylome 11 , further supporting our conclusion. Our <lb/>work also provides a comprehensive atlas at the genome-<lb/>wide scale of the DNA methylation landscape in oocytes <lb/>and zygotes from Stella Δ mice, which offers new insights <lb/>into the Stella function in epigenetic control. <lb/></body>
