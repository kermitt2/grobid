Heffner 2 , Emily B.

A growing number of studies are probing the role of specific <lb/>cerebellar subregions, such as Crus I and Crus II, in higher-order cognitive functions including <lb/>receptive language processing. In the current fMRI study, we show evidence for the <lb/>cerebellum&apos;s sensitivity to variation in two well-studied psycholinguistic properties of <lb/>words-lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density-during passive, <lb/>continuous listening of a podcast. To determine whether, and how, activity in the cerebellum <lb/>correlates with these lexical properties, we modeled each word separately using an <lb/>amplitude-modulated regressor, time-locked to the onset of each word. At the group level, <lb/>significant effects of both lexical properties landed in expected cerebellar subregions: Crus I <lb/>and Crus II. The BOLD signal correlated with variation in each lexical property, consistent <lb/>with both language-specific and domain-general mechanisms. Activation patterns at the <lb/>individual level also showed that effects of phonological neighborhood and lexical frequency <lb/>landed in Crus I and Crus II as the most probable sites, though there was activation seen in <lb/>other lobules (especially for frequency). Although the exact cerebellar mechanisms used <lb/>during speech and language processing are not yet evident, these findings highlight the <lb/>cerebellum&apos;s role in word-level processing during continuous listening. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>During spoken language perception, the brain performs a breathtaking array of functions to <lb/>transform the incoming speech signal into a meaningful message. From segmenting the con-<lb/>tinuous speech signal into discrete words to assigning each speech stream to the correct <lb/>talker-all while simultaneously building a coherent narrative-it is no wonder that this pro-<lb/>cess engages interacting brain networks comprising cortical and subcortical structures. Despite <lb/>evidence that subcortical areas and the cerebellum are recruited for higher-order cognitive <lb/>processing (Ackermann et al., 2007; Ashida et al., 2019; Guediche et al., 2015; Stoodley &amp; <lb/>Schmahmann, 2010), neuroanatomical research of speech and language has almost entirely <lb/>focused on the cerebral cortex (e.g., Hickok &amp; Poeppel, 2007).

        <body>relatively well studied in the sensorimotor domain (for review, see Ohyama et al., 2003), it <lb/>remains a neural underdog in the language domain. Due in part to significant developments in <lb/>understanding the cerebellum&apos;s neural circuitry and its connections to cortical and subcortical <lb/>areas (Alvarez &amp; Fiez, 2018; Balsters et al., 2013; Bostan et al., 2013; Buckner, 2013; Diedrichsen, <lb/>2006; Fiez et al., 1992; Kelly &amp; Strick, 2003; Leiner et al., 1994; Marek et al., 2018; Middleton <lb/>&amp; Strick, 2000; Ramnani, 2012; Stoodley &amp; Schmahmann, 2009; Xue et al., 2021), and insight <lb/>into its contributions to the perception and production of language (Argyropoulos, 2016; <lb/>Booth et al., 2007; Guediche et al., 2015; Kotz &amp; Schwartze, 2010; Manto &amp; Mariën, 2015; <lb/>Marek et al., 2018; Mariën et al., 2014; Moberget &amp; Ivry, 2019; Pleger &amp; Timmann, 2018; <lb/>van Dun et al., 2016), interest in the role of the cerebellum in mapping the speech signal <lb/>to phonetic and lexical units has grown over the past few decades. <lb/>The uniform microarchitecture of the cerebellum has led to the hypothesis that a single (or <lb/>multiple) universal cerebellar mechanism(s) may be adaptable to motor and non-motor <lb/>domains (Diedrichsen et al., 2019; Ito, 2008), perhaps achieved through unique structural and <lb/>functional connections with cortex (Booth et al., 2007; Guell et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2021). <lb/>The cerebellum has a remarkable amount of functional diversity in involvement in non-motor <lb/>language-related tasks (Desmond et al., 1997; Desmond &amp; Fiez, 1998; D&apos;Mello et al., 2017; <lb/>Durisko &amp; Fiez, 2010; Moberget &amp; Ivry, 2016; Stoodley et al., 2012; Stoodley &amp; Schmahmann, <lb/>2009; van Dun et al., 2016), inspiring calls to determine a potential cerebellar system perhaps <lb/>comprised of one or multiple adaptable mechanisms that contribute to language processing <lb/>(Argyropoulos, 2016; Ito, 2005, 2008; Moberget &amp; Ivry, 2016; Skipper &amp; Lametti, 2021; Sokolov <lb/>et al., 2017). If the cerebellum recruits spatially segregated regions, then characterizing its contri-<lb/>butions to higher-order language processes can be informed by precisely defining the specific <lb/>loci for processing the basic properties of language, including the lexical properties of words. <lb/>Although recent work suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in word-level concep-<lb/>tual processing (LeBel et al., 2021), no studies to date have directly measured cerebellar <lb/>responses to lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density-two properties <lb/>known to influence word recognition during speech perception. Examining the cerebellar <lb/>response to these two fundamental properties of the lexicon allows for the exploration into <lb/>the potential roles of the cerebellum during the dynamic process of lexical retrieval. One <lb/>potential mechanism is that the cerebellum encodes and adjusts internal models (Argyropoulos, <lb/>2016; E et al., 2014; Ishikawa et al., 2016) which can serve as the basis for generating and <lb/>adjusting linguistic predictions. Put simply, an internal model is an adaptive, context-specific <lb/>representation that allows for efficient processing of an incoming sensory experience (Moberget <lb/>et al., 2014). A critical affordance of internal models, both in the motor and cognitive domains, <lb/>is the ability to predict what will happen next and to calculate prediction errors that capture <lb/>the unexpected (Ito, 2008). An increasing number of empirical studies have tested hypotheses <lb/>related to the cerebellum&apos;s role in linguistic predictions (Guediche et al., 2015; Lesage et al., <lb/>2012, 2016; Moberget et al., 2014) prompting a number of review articles on the topic (e.g., <lb/>Pleger &amp; Timmann, 2018; Skipper &amp; Lametti, 2021). <lb/>Another proposed role for the cerebellum concerns semantic integration. Focal disruption <lb/>of the right posterior cerebellum interrupts judgments on the semantic relatedness of word <lb/>pairs (Gatti et al., 2020). Further, in studies of continuous listening, the cerebellum is shown <lb/>to be sensitive to dissociable conceptual feature dimensions of single words (LeBel et al., <lb/>2021). Prediction and integration-the proposed cerebellar roles sketched here-are both <lb/>connected to the dynamic process of lexical retrieval, though we note that the current study <lb/>is unable to fully distinguish between them during continuous listening. Rather, here, we focus <lb/>on identifying the spatial loci of cerebellar sensitivity to lexical frequency and phonological <lb/>Lexical frequency: <lb/>Indicates the commonness of a word, <lb/>with words that are more commonly <lb/>encountered having higher <lb/>frequency values. <lb/>Phonological neighborhood density: <lb/>Indicates the number of words that <lb/>differ from a target word by one <lb/>phoneme, with higher values <lb/>describing words with more <lb/>neighbors (e.g., cat). <lb/>Internal models: <lb/>Context-specific representations that <lb/>allow for efficient processing of <lb/>incoming sensory and motor <lb/>information. <lb/></body>

        <body>neighborhood density during task-free continuous listening; conditions that best approximate <lb/>natural lexical processing. <lb/>Lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density have shaped theoretical and <lb/>computational accounts of lexical processing (Benkı , 2003; Besner &amp; Young, 2022; Brysbaert <lb/>et al., 2018; Chen &amp; Mirman, 2015; Dahan et al., 2001; Luce &amp; Pisoni, 1998; Savin, 1963). <lb/>Lexical frequency is a measure of the commonness of a word, while phonological neighbor-<lb/>hood density refers to the number of words that differ from a target word by one <lb/>phoneme-whether added, subtracted, or changed (Vitevitch et al., 1999; Vitevitch &amp; Luce, <lb/>2016). The lexical frequency effect describes the impact of frequency on the ease of word <lb/>recognition. Less frequent words tend to slow access to a word&apos;s form (Dahan et al., 2001). <lb/>This effect emerges in a variety of active tasks including word naming, lexical decision, and <lb/>priming (for reviews, see Brysbaert et al., 2011; Brysbaert et al., 2018). Studies of phonological <lb/>neighborhood density have generally shown that word recognition is slowed for words occu-<lb/>pying denser neighborhoods compared to sparser ones (for review, see Vitevitch &amp; Luce, 2016) <lb/>though this effect is not monotonic (Chen &amp; Mirman, 2015). Beyond recognition, these prop-<lb/>erties are also likely to affect a word&apos;s integration into the broader context (Cibelli et al., 2015). <lb/>Taken together, a word&apos;s frequency and number of phonological neighbors likely modulates <lb/>online word recognition as well as integrative processing. <lb/>In the cerebral cortex, word frequency and phonological neighborhood density modulate <lb/>activity in canonical language regions including the middle temporal gyrus and supramarginal <lb/>gyrus (Gow, 2012; Peramunage et al., 2011; Prabhakaran et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2011). <lb/>Frontal lobe activation associated with these two properties has also led to domain-general <lb/>arguments regarding differences in cognitive control demands such as those associated with <lb/>challenges to lexical selection (Binder et al., 2004; Luthra et al., 2019; Righi et al., 2010; <lb/>Zhuang et al., 2011). While the effects of frequency and neighborhood density have emerged <lb/>in the cerebral cortex, of interest is whether activity in the cerebellum is also modulated by <lb/>lexical-level properties during continuous listening. <lb/>The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was passive in nature; par-<lb/>ticipants only listened to a podcast without any additional task. The vast majority of studies <lb/>(behavioral and neural) examining lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density <lb/>effects have used artificial active tasks that involve making decisions about words presented in <lb/>isolation (e.g., lexical decision in Dahan et al., 2001); leaving open whether these effects <lb/>emerge in more ecologically valid contexts, such as when listening to a podcast. Recent stud-<lb/>ies using fMRI have shown substantial success in modeling semantic, syntactic, and lexical-<lb/>level properties of continuous speech and text (Brennan, 2016; Brennan et al., 2016; LeBel <lb/>et al., 2021; Wehbe et al., 2014) despite the sluggish nature of the hemodynamic response <lb/>in relation to the rapid nature of conversational speech. The potential for fMRI to capture these <lb/>rapidly occurring lexically modulated effects in the cerebellum is especially appealing as <lb/>other neuroimaging techniques are not as well suited for capturing responses in such deep-<lb/>seated structures. Thus, we follow the precedent set by other studies and model words (verbs, <lb/>nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and function words) using individual, canonical hemodynamic <lb/>response functions (HRFs) to assess how word-level processing modulates cerebellar activity <lb/>during continuous listening (Brennan et al., 2016). Critically, we chose an analysis approach-<lb/>amplitude modulated regression-that allows us to model the relationship between activity in <lb/>the cerebellum with variation in each lexical property over time. This analysis identifies <lb/>regions for which by-item differences in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal cor-<lb/>relates with by-item variation in each lexical property above and beyond activity associated <lb/>with the time course alone (see Mechtenberg et al., 2021; Xie &amp; Myers, 2018). For example, a <lb/>Amplitude modulated regression: <lb/>In fMRI, an analysis technique that <lb/>models how changes in neural <lb/>activity correlate with changes in a <lb/>continuous variable of interest. <lb/></body>

        <body>positive correlation reflects that for each step that lexical frequency increases, activity in the <lb/>cerebellum also increases proportionally. <lb/>We hypothesize that the effects of both lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood <lb/>density should emerge in the postero-lateral cerebellar cortex-Crus I and/or Crus II. <lb/>Meta-analyses of cerebellar activation across a range of tasks-language, motor, spatial pro-<lb/>cessing, working memory, executive control, and emotion-shows Crus I, Crus II, and Lobule <lb/>VI (see Figure 1A in Materials and Methods for labeled cerebellar atlas) emerging as the most <lb/>likely regions to support receptive language processing (Mariën et al., 2014; Pleger &amp; Timmann, <lb/>2018; Schmahmann, 2019; Stoodley et al., 2012). Highly relevant to the current paper, <lb/>activation differences associated with lexical predictability have been observed in Crus I and <lb/>Crus II. When semantic predictability and sentence-final target-word congruency were syste-<lb/>matically manipulated, a region in Crus I/Crus II was activated when final words could be <lb/>predicted based on context (compared to scrambled sentences) and had even greater activa-<lb/>tion when final words violated predictions, thought to reflect both predictive processing and <lb/>cerebellar involvement in error processing (Moberget et al., 2014). The Crus I/Crus II response <lb/>to lexical prediction also co-occurs with changes in the cortical language network (D&apos;Mello <lb/>et al., 2017), supporting its contribution (at least in part) to language processes. Further, during <lb/>continuous listening, Crus I/Crus II (as well as Lobules VIIIA and VIIIB) showed sensitivity to <lb/>conceptual feature dimensions at the word-level (LeBel et al., 2021). <lb/>Despite some confidence in where we expect to find cerebellar sensitivity to lexical fre-<lb/>quency and phonological neighborhood density, studies report variability in regards to other <lb/>subregions-such as Lobule VII, VIII, and IX-that may be recruited for language processing <lb/>due to additional cognitive demands (e.g., working memory and executive control) that are <lb/>not a result of processing speech or lexical information specifically (Balsters et al., 2013; <lb/>Schmahmann, 2019). If effects are observed in these regions, they may reflect differences in <lb/>domain-general cognitive demands associated with variation in frequency and phonological <lb/>neighborhood density. Activity in Lobules IV and V (and even portions of Lobule VI; see Figure 1A <lb/>in Materials and Methods for a labeled cerebellar atlas) has been correlated with language pro-<lb/>duction tasks that engage motor output such as writing and speaking (Manto &amp; Mariën, 2015; <lb/>Pleger &amp; Timmann, 2018; Schmahmann, 2019; Stoodley et al., 2012). As our &quot;task&quot; is entirely <lb/>passive and does not require any motor output it would be unexpected, but interesting, if we <lb/>observed activity in these regions (Galantucci et al., 2006). Finally, it is worth noting that activity <lb/>in Crus I/Crus II has not exclusively been associated with language-related tasks. For instance, <lb/>other cognitive functions also reliably activate different subregions of Crus I/Crus II including tasks <lb/>requiring executive control and working memory (Ashida et al., 2019; Balsters et al., 2013; <lb/>D&apos;Mello et al., 2020; Habas, 2021). The design of the present study does not allow us to untangle <lb/>what is language-specific or not during naturalistic listening. As such, our interpretation of poten-<lb/>tial effects of lexical information will also consider domain-general explanations. <lb/>Precise localization of cerebellar effects at the group level can be challenging owing to <lb/>considerable individual variability in cerebellar anatomy (Diedrichsen, 2006; Kong et al., <lb/>2021; Kozlova, 1984). For this reason, in addition to group-level analyses, we also report <lb/>the results of individual-level analyses, which are spatially aligned to a probabilistic atlas of <lb/>the cerebellum (Diedrichsen, 2006). The individual-level analyses allow for a more precise <lb/>spatial localization tailored to each individual. Similar approaches have been used in auditory <lb/>cortex (see Okada &amp; Hickok, 2006), where variability in the precise location of activity seen at <lb/>the individual level would have been obscured at the group level. Reporting the individual-<lb/>level spatial maps also helps to verify that group-level results were not driven by only a few <lb/>participants. <lb/></body>

        <body>In the current study, we scanned 79 adults via fMRI while they passively listened to 10 min <lb/>of a popular podcast. We aim to provide insight into cerebellar involvement in word-level <lb/>processing by modeling the effects of lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood den-<lb/>sity during continuous listening at the group and at the individual level. We interpret these <lb/>findings through both language-specific and domain-general mechanisms. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Participants <lb/>Seventy-nine participants (male = 17, female = 61, other = 1) were recruited from the Univer-<lb/>sity of Connecticut community as part of a larger project from our group (Heffner &amp; Myers, <lb/>2021). All reported that they were native speakers of American English, had no hearing loss <lb/>or neurological disorders, and were over 18 years of age (M = 23.94, range: 18-43). Partici-<lb/>pants provided written consent based on the University of Connecticut&apos;s Institutional Review <lb/>Board guidelines and were screened for MRI safety. Each participant was compensated <lb/>$30/hour. <lb/>Podcast <lb/>All participants listened to the same clip of the first 10 min of an episode of National Public <lb/>Radio&apos;s podcast Fresh Air With Terry Gross called &quot;A Science Writer Explores the &apos;Perversions <lb/>and Potential&apos; of Genetic Tests,&quot; with interviewee Dr. Carl Zimmer (Gross, 2018). The use of <lb/>this podcast in a research context falls under Fair Use Laws. Please visit https://www.copyright <lb/>.gov/fair-use/more-info.html for more information. The podcast features a female host and a <lb/>male interviewee in an interview-style turn-taking discourse. Both talkers spoke in their native <lb/>language, American English. <lb/>Word boundaries were identified by the Penn Forced Aligner (Yuan &amp; Liberman, 2008) and <lb/>were manually checked for good fit. Word boundaries were adjusted when appropriate. Our <lb/>two lexical dimensions of interest, lexical frequency (SUBTLWF US , Brysbaert &amp; New, 2009) <lb/>and phonological neighborhood density (complete lexicon, no homophones) were determined <lb/>for each word within the 10-min segment using the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., <lb/>2007). Excluded words included personal names (e.g., Terry Gross and Carl Zimmer), acro-<lb/>nyms (e.g., DNA), and the word &quot;epigenetic&quot; as it did not appear in the SUBTLWF US corpus. <lb/>Values of lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density were log-transformed and <lb/>then z-scored. There was a statistically significant correlation between lexical frequency and <lb/>phonological neighborhood density (R 2 = 0.37, p &lt; 0.01). We checked the severity of the col-<lb/>linearity by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor ( VIF), which came to 1.587. VIF values <lb/>below five are considered to be of low concern (O&apos;Brien, 2007). Thus, the relationship <lb/>between the lexical factors is unlikely to limit our ability to accurately model word frequency <lb/>and neighborhood density. The timing for each word&apos;s onset was extracted using the software <lb/>Praat (Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2022). These were used as the stimulus onset times in the <lb/>amplitude-modulated regression, which is described in detail in the fMRI Data Analysis <lb/>section. <lb/>MRI Procedure <lb/>After obtaining high-resolution structural scans, each participant was told that they were going <lb/>to listen to 10 min of a podcast.

        <body>(i.e., fixation cross) or behavioral component; participants merely listened to the podcast and <lb/>were instructed to keep their eyes open and listen attentively. <lb/>fMRI Acquisition <lb/>Structural and functional MRI images were acquired from a 3-T Prisma Scanner (Erlanger, Ger-<lb/>many). T1-weighted structural images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid <lb/>gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2,400 ms, echo time [TE] = <lb/>2.22 ms, inversion time = 1,000 ms, flip angle = 8°, 300 × 320 matrix, voxel size = 0.8 × <lb/>0.8 × 0.8 mm 3 ). Functional volumes were collected every 1,000 ms (TR = 1,000 ms, TE = <lb/>25 ms) in an ascending, interleaved order with an accelerated multiband sequence (multi-<lb/>band factor = 4, 52 slices, 2.5-mm thick, 110 × 110 acquisition matrix, flip angle = 62°). <lb/>fMRI Data Analysis <lb/>All analyses were completed using AFNI (Cox, 1996). Functional images were preprocessed <lb/>using a standard pipeline. Images were de-obliqued, outlier volumes were censored, motion <lb/>corrected via a six-parameter rigid body transform and the aligned functional images to each <lb/>participant&apos;s skull-stripped anatomical images. Initial normalization used the Talairach atlas <lb/>(Talairach &amp; Tournoux, 1988), but for the purpose of mapping to the Montreal Neurological <lb/>Institute (MNI)-transformed cerebellar atlas, output of the first-level regression was then <lb/>warped to MNI space. After normalization, images were smoothed using a 4-mm Gaussian <lb/>kernel and all motion and signal outliers were removed following standard AFNI procedures. <lb/>As the current study is exclusively concerned with patterns of activity within the cerebellum, <lb/>we created individual participant masks using a native AFNI cerebellum mask to restrict the <lb/>analysis of the functional data to the cerebellum. We then combined the individual masks to <lb/>create a group cerebellum mask with overlapping voxels for at least 75 out of 79 participants. <lb/>To do this, we first created by-participant masks (generated during AFNI pre-processing) to <lb/>identify all voxels with functional data that fell within the cerebellum. These masks were <lb/>aligned and overlaid, and we excluded any voxel for which there was not usable functional <lb/>data for at least 75 participants. This procedure ensures that each voxel will have representa-<lb/>tion from the majority of participants, and also avoids shrinking the size of the group mask <lb/>unduly if a few participants have atypical anatomy. <lb/>To assess word-level sensitivity to variation in lexical frequency and phonological neigh-<lb/>borhood density, we used amplitude-modulated regression. For this approach, we created a <lb/>single time-series vector containing the onset of each word in the podcast together with both <lb/>the corresponding lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density values. The <lb/>participant-level regression using this time-series vector was implemented using the &quot;-stim_ <lb/>times_AM2&quot; flag in the 3dDeconvolve function in AFNI. The vector was convolved with a <lb/>canonical HRF function and further regressed with the six movement parameters generated <lb/>during preprocessing. The output, for each participant, was two amplitude-modulated <lb/>by-voxel fit coefficients-one modeling sensitivity to lexical frequency and the other to pho-<lb/>nological neighborhood density. As this was a simultaneous regression, we were able to <lb/>evaluate the cerebellar sensitivity to lexical frequency while controlling for phonological <lb/>neighborhood density and vice versa. <lb/>We ran two group-level analyses, each estimating the main effects of BOLD signal changes <lb/>to lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density (separately) versus an implicit <lb/>baseline (see Figure 1B and 1D). Group-level comparisons were done with a t test using the <lb/>3dttest++ function in AFNI. Outputs of each test were constrained to the group-level <lb/></body>

        <body>cerebellum mask described above and cluster thresholded. Cluster thresholding was deter-<lb/>mined using the 3dClustSim function via a mixed autocorrelation function that used 10,000 <lb/>Monte Carlo simulations (Cox et al., 2017) on the group mask. We estimated the group-level <lb/>spatial smoothness by averaging across all participants&apos; noise smoothness values by extracting <lb/>their ACF parameters using 3dFWHMx and including the &quot;-acf&quot; flag within 3dClustSim. This <lb/>approach to thresholding fMRI data has been shown to address the concerns associated with <lb/>Type I error rates in fMRI analyses (Eklund et al., 2016). The corrected group-level threshold <lb/>was set at a voxelwise threshold of p &lt; 0.001 with an alpha value of 0.01, used a two-sided <lb/>thresholding, and a cluster size of 32 voxels. <lb/>To visualize individual differences and capture variability in the localization of the effect of <lb/>our regressors of interest, we constructed a heat map (limited to the bounds of the cerebellum) <lb/>that layered individual activation clusters by combining the betas from the first-level regres-<lb/>sion. For individual-level activation thresholds, we set the cluster threshold to a voxelwise <lb/>threshold of p &lt; 0.01 at an alpha of 0.05, using two-sided thresholding, cluster size: 78 voxels. <lb/>At this threshold, eight participants did not have any significant clusters for lexical frequency <lb/>(Figure 2A; n = 71) and nine participants did not have any significant clusters for phonological <lb/>neighborhood density (Figure 2B; n = 69). The heat maps are additionally constrained depict-<lb/>ing only voxels that were shared by at least six participants. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Group-Level Effects of Lexical Frequency and Phonological Neighborhood Density <lb/>At the group-level, a significant effect of lexical frequency emerged in three cerebellar clusters <lb/>(corrected at a threshold of p &lt; 0.01; voxelwise threshold of p &lt; 0.001, 32 voxel minimum <lb/>Figure 2.

        <body>cluster size). Each cluster showed a positive correlation with lexical frequency such that <lb/>increased lexical frequency was associated with increased activation in these regions. As <lb/>shown in Figure 1B, the two largest clusters were in right and left Crus I-extending into infe-<lb/>rior and lateral portions of Crus II-and superior parts of Lobule VI (see Figure 1A for labeled <lb/>cerebellar atlas). A small cluster was also found in Lobule IX (see Table 1). <lb/>Phonological neighborhood density effects emerged in two bilateral clusters-located in <lb/>Crus I and extended into Crus II (see Figure 1D). The size of the two clusters differed, however, <lb/>showing a right-hemisphere bias with the right cluster spanning 463 voxels and the left cluster <lb/>with only 77 voxels (see Table 1). Phonological neighborhood measures were negatively cor-<lb/>related with changes in BOLD (i.e., words with sparse neighborhoods were associated with <lb/>greater activity in both clusters). <lb/>To facilitate spatial comparison of the two bilateral Crus I/Crus II clusters for each lexical <lb/>factor, we computed the overlap using 3dcalc and 3dABoverlap-with the resulting overlap <lb/>shown in Figure 1B. There was a remarkable degree of overlap. For the left cluster, the overlap <lb/>encompassed an extensive area with only two voxels uniquely sensitive to phonological <lb/>neighborhood density. In the right cerebellar cluster, 41 voxels were uniquely sensitive to pho-<lb/>nological neighborhood density. <lb/>Individual Variability <lb/>To explore potential variability in the localization of lexical sensitivity in the cerebellum, we <lb/>mapped clusters sensitive to lexical frequency (see Figure 2A) and phonological neighborhood <lb/>density (see Figure 2B) for each participant. Overlap across participants is shown qualitatively <lb/>via a heat map, with hotter colors indicating a greater number of participants activating the <lb/>same voxel. For lexical frequency, the greatest overlap was found primarily in a region corre-<lb/>sponding to the left cerebellar Crus I/Crus II cluster, which also emerged in the group results. <lb/>There was less consistency in the activation pattern in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Over-<lb/>all, there were widespread effects of lexical frequency. Across individuals, effects of frequency <lb/>were additionally observed in Lobules V, VII, VIII, and IX. Activation associated with phonol-<lb/>ogical neighborhood density was more focal across participants and landed mostly in Crus <lb/>I/Crus II. For phonological neighborhood density, the hottest regions were similar to those <lb/>Table 1.

        <body>found at the group-level. However, there seemed to be less of a right-hemisphere bias <lb/>observed in the group-level results. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The current study&apos;s aims were twofold. First, we built on existing fMRI studies of naturalistic <lb/>continuous speech processing (Brennan et al., 2016; LeBel et al., 2021). We modeled word-<lb/>by-word variation in two lexical statistics, which have been pivotal in our understanding of <lb/>language processing, while participants passively listened to 10 min of a popular podcast. As <lb/>evident in the results, an amplitude-modulated regression approach identified variation of the <lb/>BOLD signal in the cerebellum associated with lexical properties during continuous <lb/>listening. Our second aim was concerned with the nature of the cerebellum&apos;s response to <lb/>variation in lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density. At the group level, <lb/>functional sensitivity to both lexical frequency and phonological neighborhood density fell <lb/>in predicted subregions-primarily bilateral Crus I and Crus II, extending somewhat into <lb/>Lobule IX. At the individual level, there was a considerable amount of variability in the loca-<lb/>tion and degree of activation to both factors. <lb/>There was a positive relationship between activation and lexical frequency and a negative <lb/>relationship between activation and phonological neighborhood density. The correlations <lb/>between cerebellar activity and each lexical measure were in a consistent direction, suggest-<lb/>ing that the cerebellum is sensitive to lexical-level properties that are known to affect word <lb/>recognition. Of further interest is whether sensitivity to phonological neighborhood density <lb/>and lexical frequency in Crus I/Crus II emerged in common voxels. Figure 1 shows the extent <lb/>of the overlap; the majority of the voxels sensitive to phonological neighborhood density were <lb/>shared with those activated for frequency effects. Since both factors are known to impact lex-<lb/>ical processing, this naturally leads to the question: What role might the cerebellum play in <lb/>online language comprehension? <lb/>When listening to spoken language, the statistical distributions of the incoming speech sig-<lb/>nal are tracked at multiple levels of processing (e.g., Luthra et al., 2021; Theodore &amp; Miller, <lb/>2008). However, much of what we know about the neural responses associated with these <lb/>distributions has almost exclusively been restricted to the cerebral cortex. With a growing con-<lb/>sensus that the cerebellum is integral to the neural architecture that supports spoken language <lb/>comprehension (Bonhage et al., 2015; Geva et al., 2021; Moberget &amp; Ivry, 2016; Stoodley &amp; <lb/>Schmahmann, 2009), we focus on how the cerebellum might rely on internal models (Ito, <lb/>2005; Ivry, 1997; Ivry &amp; Keele, 1989; Wolpert et al., 1998) that represent word-sound relation-<lb/>ships. The cerebellum has been proposed to generate perceptual and linguistic predictions, <lb/>and also to integrate single words with the broader linguistic context, by &quot;tracking&quot; word-level <lb/>behaviorally relevant distributions. <lb/>The work on the cerebellum and language-based internal models has focused primarily on <lb/>the role of the cerebellum in generating linguistic predictions; for example, investigating the <lb/>cerebellum&apos;s role in semantically generated lexical predictions from a preceding sentence <lb/>context (Moberget et al., 2014). While there is strong evidence for cerebellar involvement <lb/>in this process, there is debate regarding the nature of these linguistic predictions; whether <lb/>they are generated from motor processes (Pickering &amp; Gambi, 2018), involve associative <lb/>semantic relationships (e.g., Argyropoulos, 2011), or occur at multiple levels (Skipper &amp; <lb/>Lametti, 2021). Our finding of a common area that is sensitive to both lexical frequency <lb/>and phonological neighborhood density suggests that phonological-lexical statistics are <lb/>tracked by the cerebellum and may help in generating predictions and/or encoding prediction <lb/></body>

        <body>errors at multiple levels of processing. Importantly, the clusters associated with lexical varia-<lb/>tion were located in Crus I/Crus II. These subregions are not associated with motor processing <lb/>(Stoodley et al., 2012), suggesting that the predictions generated during listening and compre-<lb/>hension are not limited to motor-based processes. <lb/>The current study used a natural, continuous speech stimulus. Continuous speech contains <lb/>rich cues, at the sentential and the conversational level, motivating a more active <lb/>listening experience that is conducive for generating predictions about upcoming linguistic <lb/>elements and for integrating words into the broader context. There is little dispute that predic-<lb/>tions are beneficial when deciphering ambiguous speech and listening in noisy environments <lb/>(for review, see Mattys et al., 2012). In noise, prediction accuracy is modulated by lexical fre-<lb/>quency; high frequency words are more easily and accurately predicted than low frequency <lb/>words (Benkı , 2003; Besner &amp; Young, 2022; Huizeling et al., 2022). Words with denser pho-<lb/>nological neighborhoods are likely to generate a greater number of potential candidates (or <lb/>predictions) compatible at different time points of the unfolding speech signal (Luce &amp; Pisoni, <lb/>1998). Thus, our findings are broadly consistent with a prediction interpretation in which <lb/>lexical knowledge contributes to predictions about what we hear. In particular, the voxels sen-<lb/>sitive to both frequency and neighborhood density in Crus I/Crus II may be due to their <lb/>involvement in lexically generated phonological predictions, as has been previously suggested <lb/>(Guediche et al., 2014; Guediche et al., 2015; Lesage et al., 2017). <lb/>Prediction is only one possible framework for interpreting the cerebellum&apos;s role in speech <lb/>comprehension that fits with the current results. For instance, semantic integration of a given <lb/>word with surrounding words-and the entire discourse-is also affected by the word&apos;s prop-<lb/>erties. Evidence points to higher frequency words being processed faster than lower frequency <lb/>words (reviewed in Huizeling et al., 2022). If higher frequency words are accessed more easily <lb/>and more rapidly, we might expect that these same words are easier to integrate with previ-<lb/>ously heard context (Ferreira &amp; Chantavarin, 2018; Roodenrys et al., 2002). Further, frequency <lb/>effects tap into retrieval and integration mechanisms at multiple levels of processing including <lb/>the word&apos;s phonological form (Fox, 1984) and discourse-level context (Brodbeck et al., 2022). <lb/>Phonological neighborhood density may also affect word recognition as it unfolds over time. <lb/>Since the relatedness of a preceding semantic context is also known to modulate the magni-<lb/>tude of neighborhood density effects (Chen &amp; Mirman, 2015), phonological neighborhood <lb/>density may also impact ease of contextual semantic integration. <lb/>It may be that the cerebellum reflects the ease of processing individual words as modulated <lb/>solely by a given word&apos;s lexical properties (either in terms of prediction, integration, or both); <lb/>an interpretation that cannot be disentangled from the ease of processing words that vary in <lb/>their demands on domain-general resources (e.g., working memory demands). To this point, <lb/>the Crus I/Crus II subregions that emerged in the current study are also implicated in domain-<lb/>general processes via functional connectivity with cortex. Resting state functional connectivity <lb/>studies have shown that portions of Crus I/Crus II are associated with the default mode network <lb/>(Buckner et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2021) as well as fronto-parietal executive control networks <lb/>(Habas, 2021; Habas et al., 2009). Resting state approaches, however, speak to whether cer-<lb/>tain regions pattern together at rest. Thus, they are limited in their ability to speak to task-<lb/>specific connectivity. Studies that have used task-based functional connectivity analyses for <lb/>language processes tend to show Crus I/Crus II patterning with the canonical cortical lan-<lb/>guage network (Ashida et al., 2019; King et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2021). There does appear <lb/>to be some overlap between language-specific and more domain-general functional net-<lb/>works in cognitive cerebellar regions (Ashida et al., 2019), and there is growing evidence <lb/>that domain-general networks might contribute to various aspects of language processing. <lb/></body>

        <body>Concerning the default mode network specifically, the traditional view was that it supported <lb/>task disengagement functions such as mind-wandering (for review, see Raichle, 2015). More <lb/>recently, the default mode network is shown to have potential involvement in language-<lb/>related tasks such as narrative comprehension and semantic access (Chang et al., 2022; <lb/>Simony et al., 2016), as well direct overlap with the semantic network (Binder et al., <lb/>2009). Interestingly, the default mode network (including the cerebellum) can be subdivided <lb/>into multiple networks, some of which are implicated in language processing (Buckner &amp; <lb/>DiNicola, 2019; Gordon et al., 2020). Regardless of whether sensitivity to word-level infor-<lb/>mation in the cerebellum is due to domain-general or language-specific mechanisms, there <lb/>is mounting evidence pointing toward the cerebellum&apos;s involvement in language processing <lb/>(Schmahmann, 2019) that cannot be discounted. Differences in connectivity findings may <lb/>indicate that traditional boundaries between online language processing and domain-<lb/>general functions are rather artificial (Binder et al., 2009; Dohmatob et al., 2020). Further <lb/>work is needed to carefully parcellate the cortical functional networks in specific subregions <lb/>of the cerebellum across a wide range of tasks including continuous listening. <lb/>On the issue of specificity, group-level effects do not necessarily capture what emerges at <lb/>the individual level, especially if there is some degree of functional and/or structural variability <lb/>(e.g., Okada &amp; Hickok, 2006). In the current study, we observed a considerable amount of <lb/>overlap at the individual level in location and degree of activation to both factors, and also <lb/>variation across individuals (see Figure 2). Individual activation maps indicate that articulatory <lb/>(Lobule V), perceptual (Lobule VI), and other cognitive processes (Lobules VII, VIII, and IX) <lb/>might also contribute to the emergence of lexical frequency effects in the cerebellum. Individ-<lb/>ual variation in sensitivity to neighborhood density was not as widespread as that of lexical <lb/>frequency nor was it as variable across individuals. Density effects were more restricted to Crus <lb/>I/Crus II and to closely surrounding areas and was more right lateralized. Since cerebellar con-<lb/>nections to cerebral cortex are contralateral, the right-lateralized effects of phonological neigh-<lb/>borhood density in the cerebellum are consistent with the involvement of the more dominant <lb/>left-hemisphere language network (Murdoch, 2010). These findings suggest a potential cas-<lb/>cading influence of frequency and neighborhood density across the language system that var-<lb/>ies across individuals. Despite this variability, Crus I/Crus II remained the most probable sites <lb/>of activation across participants for both factors, supporting the group level results. Visualizing <lb/>the individual-level data helps to confirm the group-level results, lending confidence to the <lb/>patterns and functional loci of activity in the cerebellum reported in the current study. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>We add to mounting evidence that calls for including the cerebellum (especially Crus I/Crus II) <lb/>into neuroanatomical accounts of language processing as a critical part of the underlying func-<lb/>tional architecture, and for investigating the cerebellum&apos;s role during language processing <lb/>more broadly. While our findings cannot identify the specific cerebellar mechanisms involved <lb/>in spoken language processing, as they are consistent with many possible interpretations, they <lb/>do highlight the cerebellum&apos;s role in word-level processing. Importantly, future work can <lb/>further tease apart the contributions of specific subregions in different aspects of language pro-<lb/>cessing by using targeted manipulations of stimulus features, analyses methods (including con-<lb/>nectivity), and other methodological tools that improve localization precision and accuracy. <lb/></body>
