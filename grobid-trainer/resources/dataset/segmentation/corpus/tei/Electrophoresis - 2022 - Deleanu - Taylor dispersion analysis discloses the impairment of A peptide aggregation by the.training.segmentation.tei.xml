In this work, native amyloid peptides Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) and <lb/>fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC), tagged ones, were studied using Taylor <lb/>dispersion analysis coupled with a simultaneous UV and light-emitting diode-<lb/>induced fluorescence detection, to unravel the effect of FITC on the aggregation <lb/>process. For that, a total concentration of 100 µM of peptides consisting of a <lb/>mixture of native and tagged ones (up to 10% in moles) was applied. Results <lb/>demonstrated that FITC had a strong inhibition effect upon the aggregation <lb/>behaviour of Aβ(1-42), whereas for Aβ(1-40), only a retardation in kinetics was <lb/>observed. It was also shown that when mixed solutions of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-<lb/>42) are used, the Aβ(1-42) alloform was the leading peptide in the aggregation <lb/>process, and when the latter was tagged, the aggregation kinetics decreased but <lb/>the lifetime of potentially toxic oligomers was drastically increased. These results <lb/>confirmed that the hydrophilicity of the N-terminus part of the peptide plays a <lb/>major role in the aggregation process. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>Alzheimer, amyloid peptides, diffusion coefficient, fluorescence, Taylor dispersion analysis <lb/>1 <lb/></front>

			<body>main hallmarks of AD is the presence of amyloid β peptide <lb/>(Aβ) plaques in the brain of patients and several evidence <lb/>points that Aβ peptides are one of the main reasons behind <lb/>the symptoms of AD either in its oligomeric form (thought <lb/>to be neurotoxic) [1, 2] or in its fibrillary form [3]. <lb/>In all cases, there is a necessity to better understand <lb/>the aggregation mechanism of Aβ peptides.

			<body>the in vivo ones (nM range [4]). Studying the aggregation <lb/>process of amyloid peptides in detail is a challenging task <lb/>especially at concentrations in the order of magnitude of <lb/>physiological ones. For that, the use of selective and sensi-<lb/>tive detection methods such as fluorescence-based ones is <lb/>highly desirable to study peptides at lower concentrations <lb/>[5]. This strategy implies a modification of the peptide <lb/>structure by adding a label often on its N-terminal end. <lb/>However, the attached tag may affect the physical and <lb/>chemical properties of the amyloid peptides [6] and their <lb/>propensity to form beta-sheets and thus fibrillar structures. <lb/>Wägele et al. [6] studied, by fluorescence correlation spec-<lb/>troscopy (FCS), the effect of four fluorescent tags (HiLyte <lb/>647, HiLyte 488, Atto 655 and Atto 488) on the oligomer dis-<lb/>tribution of both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). They concluded <lb/>that HiLyte 647 and Atto 655, compared to the other two <lb/>tags, had high peptide-tag interactions which promoted <lb/>the formation of the high molecular weight oligomers <lb/>of Aβ(1-40) and consequently the fibrillation step. In <lb/>this experiment, Atto 488 seemed to be the most suitable <lb/>as no significant interaction was noted. Quinn et al. <lb/>[7] demonstrated that HiLyte Fluor 555-labelling of Aβ <lb/>peptides on its N-terminus did not alter the self-assembly <lb/>kinetics or the resulting aggregated structures. On the <lb/>contrary, Taverna et al. demonstrated that a fluorescent tag <lb/>(FluoProbes 488 NHS Ester) attached on a side-chain of <lb/>amyloid Aβ(1-42) (on the amines of Lys-16, Lys-28 and/or <lb/>N-terminus Asp residues) inhibited the aggregation [8]. In <lb/>another study by Zheng et al. [9], the effect of five different <lb/>dyes introduced in the form of N-hydroxysuccinimidyl <lb/>esters (BP, RB and 5-SFX) or as isothiocyanates (RITC and <lb/>5-(6)-FITC [fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate]) was evaluated. <lb/>The authors concluded that 5-SFX and 5-(6)-FITC inhib-<lb/>ited the aggregation, as no change in the R h was observed <lb/>during the incubation period of 4 h, whereas the other <lb/>three promoted it. However, this study showed limitations <lb/>as a concentration of 5 µM in peptide was used and the <lb/>aggregation was monitored for only few hours at 25 • C. <lb/>Under these conditions, the aggregation of the Aβ peptides <lb/>would take a few days (even weeks) [10] to start, and it <lb/>seems difficult to judge on the inhibition effect of these <lb/>dyes. In our opinion, in order to study the aggregation <lb/>process of amyloid peptides at relevant physiological <lb/>concentrations, one might consider the use of preformed <lb/>seeds known to accelerate the aggregation process at such <lb/>low concentrations [11]. Even though, when labelled pep-<lb/>tides are used, it is important to understand if the attached <lb/>label is not introducing a bias in the aggregation process. <lb/>Amyloid peptides exist under different isoforms, the <lb/>most common ones being Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), which <lb/>differ from the former by two extra amino acids at the C-<lb/>terminus, making it more hydrophobic. These co-existing <lb/>isoforms aggregate differently when separate [12, 13]. <lb/>However, in vivo these isoforms coexist, which is not <lb/>clear how they influence each other. In fact, it was found <lb/>that the amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients <lb/>were mainly, and sometimes exclusively, constituted of <lb/>Aβ(1-42) [14], despite that Aβ(1-40) concentration is <lb/>several-fold higher than Aβ(1-42) one. The co-aggregation <lb/>of these two isoforms was intensively studied over the last <lb/>decade [15, 16]. Some authors claimed that the peptide <lb/>mixing only influences the elongation phase by seeding <lb/>the fibrillation, but no heteromolecular fibrils are formed <lb/>[16]. But other reports suggested that mixed fibrils could <lb/>be formed [15, 17]. <lb/>In previous works, we showed the potential of Tay-<lb/>lor dispersion analysis (TDA) to speciate the aggregation <lb/>process of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), as pure or mixed pep-<lb/>tide solutions [13, 18]. In this work, we present the use <lb/>of TDA coupled with simultaneous UV and light-emitting <lb/>diode-induced fluorescence (LEDIF) detections to study <lb/>the influence of the fluorescent tag FITC on the Aβ pep-<lb/>tide aggregation and to unravel if heteromolecular species <lb/>are formed along the aggregation course. <lb/>2 <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Materials <lb/>Aβ(1-40) was prepared by fast conventional SPPS using <lb/>an Fmoc orthogonal strategy, as described elsewhere [13]. <lb/>Aβ(1-42) (batch number 100002591, &gt;95% purity by HPLC) <lb/>was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). <lb/>Both FITC peptides were tagged on their N-terminal side, <lb/>and the molar mass of the tagged peptides was confirmed <lb/>by MALDI-MS (provider) and HPLC-ESI-MS in this <lb/>work (4790 and 5016 g/mol for tagged Aβ (tAβ)(1-40) and <lb/>tAβ(1-42), respectively). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate <lb/>and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich <lb/>(France). All buffers were prepared using ultrapure water <lb/>obtained from a MilliQ system (Millipore, France). <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Peptide pretreatment and sample <lb/>preparation <lb/>Both native Aβ (nAβ) and tagged Aβ (tAβ) peptides were <lb/>pretreated independently using the protocol previously <lb/>described [13, 19]. Briefly, the peptides were first dissolved <lb/>at a concentration of 2 g/L in an ammonium hydroxide <lb/>solution (NH 4 OH), which differed between the two stud-<lb/>ied peptides (0.10% (m/v) for Aβ(1-40), 0.16% (m/v) for <lb/>Aβ(1-42)). The peptide solutions were then incubated for <lb/>10 min at room temperature then aliquoted and freeze-<lb/>dried. The stock aliquots contained 10 nmol of peptide, <lb/></body>

The pure tagged or native peptide solutions were pre-<lb/>pared directly from the aliquoted fractions and dissolved <lb/>in the adequate amount of buffer to reach the desired final <lb/>peptide concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 µM. <lb/>The mixed aliquots containing both nAβ and tAβ were <lb/>prepared so that the final sample contained either 7% of <lb/>tAβ(1-40) or 10% of tAβ(1-42). First stock aliquot of native <lb/>or tagged peptides was dissolved in 100 µl of 0.16% (m/v) <lb/>NH 4 OH, then appropriate volumes were used to obtain the <lb/>desired combinations having a total Aβ content of 10 nmol, <lb/>as detailed in Table 1. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show pie charts <lb/>with the proportion of the native and tagged peptides in the <lb/>samples. The final aliquots were immediately subjected to <lb/>freeze-drying and then stored at -20 • C before being dis-<lb/>solved in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 to perform the <lb/>aggregation study. <lb/>2.3 <lb/>Study of Aβ aggregation by Taylor <lb/>dispersion analysis <lb/>TDA was performed using an Agilent 7100 (Waldbronn, <lb/>Germany) capillary electrophoresis system with bare fused <lb/>silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, USA), having <lb/>60 cm × 50 µm i.d. dimensions and a UV detection window <lb/>at 51.5 cm from the inlet end. The system was coupled with <lb/>a Zetalif LEDIF detector (Picometrics, Toulouse, France) <lb/>with a window at 33 cm from the inlet end. The capillary <lb/>was conditioned with the following flushes: 1 M NaOH <lb/>(30 min) followed by a flush with ultrapure water (30 min). <lb/>Between each analysis, the capillary was rinsed with a <lb/>20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 2 min. Sam-<lb/>ples were injected hydrodynamically on the inlet end of <lb/>the capillary (44 mbar, 4 s), and the injected volume was <lb/>about 6.5 nl, corresponding to 1% of the capillary volume <lb/>to the LEDIF detection point and 0.64% with respect to the <lb/>UV detection window. In the case of the 1, 10 and 100 µM <lb/>tAβ(1-42) samples, the solutions were injected hydrody-<lb/>namically by applying for 3 s a pressure of 33, 55 and <lb/>6 mbar, respectively. The injection volumes were modified <lb/>to prevent detector saturation. <lb/>Experiments were performed at a mobilization pressure <lb/>of 100 mbar. The temperature of the capillary cartridge was <lb/>set at 37 • C and the vial carrousel was thermostated using <lb/>an external circulating water bath 600F from JULABO <lb/>(Germany). The solutes were simultaneously monitored by <lb/>UV with an absorbance measured at 191 nm and by flu-<lb/>orescence with an excitation at 480 nm. Emission light <lb/>was collected through a ball lens and a high-pass filter <lb/>in the wavelength range from 515 to 760 nm. The propor-<lb/>tion of tagged peptide in the mixtures was chosen so that <lb/>the obtained LEDIF signal was as high as possible without <lb/>saturating the detector. The higher fluorescence intensity <lb/>observed for tAβ(1-40) presumably stems from the pres-<lb/>ence of unreacted FITC during synthesis, as observed for <lb/>these samples from the taylorgrams (see Figures S1-S8). <lb/>The mobile phase was a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer <lb/>(pH 7.4; viscosity at 37 • C: 0.7 × 10 -4 Pa s). Peptide aliquots <lb/>were first dissolved in 100 µl of a 20 mM sodium phosphate <lb/>buffer solution (pH 7.4) to reach a final concentration <lb/>of 100 µM and then immediately transferred to a vial to <lb/>be incubated at 37 • C in the capillary electrophoresis car-<lb/>rousel. The aggregation was conducted by injecting the <lb/>sample (V inj ≈ 7 nl) every 11 min for 100% Aβ(1-42) experi-<lb/>ments, and each 30 min for all the experiments containing <lb/>Aβ(1-40). The total average of TDA injections was between <lb/>124 and 185 TDA runs per sample, corresponding to a total <lb/>sample volume consumption between 870 and 1300 nl (0.87 <lb/>and 1.3 µl). Finally, to prevent sample evaporation, the vial <lb/>cap was changed three times a day. All taylorgrams were <lb/>recorded using Agilent ChemStation software and then <lb/>exported to Microsoft Excel for subsequent data process-<lb/>ing. The data obtained from the UV signal were treated on <lb/>the right side of the taylorgram to avoid the spikes detected <lb/>on the left part, as described elsewhere [13, 18]. <lb/>3 <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Influence of the peptide <lb/>concentration <lb/>The effect of the peptide concentration on the kinetics of <lb/>the aggregation process was first investigated by TDA at <lb/>different tagged peptide (tAβ(1-42)) concentrations rang-<lb/>ing from 1 to 100 µM.

			<body>F I G U R E 1 Peak area evolution of the monomer and small oligomer populations obtained for both nAβ + tAβ systems and 100% nAβ <lb/>experiments at 100 µM total peptide concentration (except for 3:1 native peptides mixture where the concentration was of 133 µM) as obtained <lb/>from the analysis of the UV-TDA (Taylor dispersion analysis) elution profile: (A) 100% nAβ(1-40), (B) 75% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42), (C) <lb/>100% nAβ(1-42), (D) 93% nAβ(1-40) + 7% tAβ(1-40), (E) 68% nAβ(1-40) + 7% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42), (F) 75% nAβ(1-40) + 15% <lb/>nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42) and (G) 90% nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42). Peak area was normalized to obtain a better comparison of the species <lb/>evolution, by dividing the area of each data point to the total peak area obtained for the first run at t ag = 0 h. The pie charts in inset denote the <lb/>proportion of the nAβ and tAβ content in the studied samples. <lb/>the case of the lowest concentrations (1 and 10 µM), over <lb/>the wholly studied incubation time (352 h for the 1 µM sam-<lb/>ple and 162 h for the 10 µM sample), suggesting that the <lb/>kinetics of the aggregation at these concentrations is very <lb/>slow, as shown in the literature the kinetics of the aggre-<lb/>gation increase with increasing concentration [20]. The <lb/>normalization of the peak area in Figure 4A was realized <lb/>for the sake of comparison and was obtained by dividing <lb/>each peak area of each run by the peak area obtained at <lb/>t ag = 0 h. <lb/>In the case of the highest concentration (i.e., 100 µM), <lb/>the peak area decreased to reach a plateau after ∼3 h of <lb/>incubation. The comparison, with a sample having the <lb/>same 100 µM total peptide concentration but with a mixing <lb/>of 90 µM nAβ(1-42) with 10 µM of tAβ(1-42), demonstrated <lb/>similar kinetics of aggregation from the LEDIF peak area. <lb/>In addition, Figure 4B shows the average R h obtained <lb/>for the 100 µM samples by the integration of the LEDIF <lb/>elution profiles as described elsewhere [21]. At t ag = 0 h <lb/>and during the first hour of incubation, the average R h <lb/>was around 1.9 nm (corresponding to the size of the Aβ(1-<lb/>42) monomer and small oligomer population, in good <lb/>agreement with previously published works [13, 18]). After <lb/>about 1 h, the R h value decreased to reach a plateau around <lb/>0.8 nm, which most likely corresponds to the free fluores-<lb/>cent tag or free tagged amino acids (FITC, theoretical R h <lb/>obtained from modelization [13] using HydroPro software <lb/>[22] on an energy-minimized 3D structure is 0.64 nm). <lb/>In the case of the low concentration samples, the R h at <lb/>t ag = 0 h was of 1.95 and 1.85 nm for the 1 and the 10 µM <lb/>samples, respectively. The average R h value decreased <lb/>very slowly with the appearance of the small population <lb/>(R h ∼ 0.8 nm) and reached the plateau after 2 weeks for the <lb/>1 µM sample (see Figure S9). Even though it is theoretically <lb/>possible to follow the aggregation process at these two low <lb/>concentrations and for a relatively long period of time, it is <lb/>not possible to do a control run without the fluorescent tag <lb/>at these concentrations because of the low sensitivity of <lb/>the UV detection as compared to fluorescence. Therefore, <lb/>in order to study the impact of the fluorescent tag, it seems <lb/></body>

The residuals plot <lb/>in the upper part of the graphs is the <lb/>difference between the experimental data and <lb/>the theoretical fit. Experimental conditions: <lb/>Sample: 100 µM of 3:1 Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) <lb/>mixture (68% nAβ(1-40) + 7% <lb/>tAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42)) at t ag = 16 h; <lb/>20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Incubation: <lb/>quiescent conditions at 37 • C. Fused silica <lb/>capillaries: 50 µm i.d. × 60 cm × 51.5 cm. <lb/>Mobile phase: 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH <lb/>7.4. Mobilization pressure: 100 mbar. <lb/>Injection: 44 mbar for 4 s. Analyses were <lb/>performed at 37 • C. UV detection at 191 nm. <lb/>Baseline treatment was performed in <lb/>Microcal Origin. The experimental fitting of <lb/>the taylorgrams was performed by using the <lb/>sum of four Gaussian functions in Microsoft <lb/>Excel. <lb/>of aggregation which can be compared in the presence or <lb/>in the absence of tagged peptide. In a recent work [13], we <lb/>showed by TDA that the products of Aβ peptide aggrega-<lb/>tion could be divided into four main populations differing <lb/>by their size. The first population is that of monomeric <lb/>and small oligomeric forms of the peptides having an <lb/>R h &lt; 5 nm. The second population corresponds to higher <lb/>molar mass oligomers with R h between 4 and 50 nm. The <lb/>third population shows R h &gt; 50 nm and corresponds to <lb/>soluble protofibrillar structures. Finally the fourth one is <lb/>that of insoluble fibrils which size is not accessible by TDA. <lb/>Figure 5 displays one example of taylorgram deconvolution <lb/>with the contributions of the different populations to the <lb/>total UV signal. The residual trace shown in the upper part <lb/>of Figure 5 (difference between the experimental data and <lb/>the theoretical fit) represents the soluble fibril fraction. <lb/>In Figure 1 are presented the area of the monomer and <lb/>small oligomers population obtained by deconvolution <lb/>of the elution profile by UV detection over the whole <lb/>aggregation process for all the studied systems. The evo-<lb/>lution of this population was found to be representative <lb/>of the aggregation kinetics [13, 18] via the consumption <lb/>of the monomeric units. As can be seen from Figure 1A, <lb/>nAβ(1-40) showed a lag phase of about 18 h before a rapid <lb/>decrease in the monomeric population to reach a final <lb/>lower plateau after ∼26 h. Aβ(1-40) is thought to follow a <lb/>secondary nucleation mechanism, where monomers add <lb/>to already existing fibrils to produce larger fibrils, without <lb/>going through intermediate states as discussed in the lit-<lb/>erature [20, 23, 24]. Conversely, the nAβ(1-42) (Figure 1C) <lb/>decreased rapidly (less than 1 h) without showing any <lb/>lag phase. The 3:1 nAβ(1-40):nAβ(1-42) mixture showed <lb/>a similar trend as for the nAβ(1-42) sample but with <lb/>slower kinetics (the plateau was reached after 16 h). As <lb/>displayed in Figure 1D, the addition of 7% of tAβ(1-40) to <lb/>nAβ(1-40) did not seem to affect the lag phase; however, <lb/>it affected the kinetics of the monomer consumption <lb/>which reached a plateau after ∼60 h instead of 26 h for <lb/>the 100% native sample. This observation suggests that <lb/>the tagged peptide influenced the elongation phase of <lb/>the aggregation mechanism but not the nucleation step. <lb/>When the tAβ(1-42) (10%) was added to the nAβ(1-42) <lb/>sample (see Figure 1G), the kinetics of the aggregation <lb/>decreased as well and the time to reach the final lower <lb/>plateau changed from less than 1 h to about 3 h. Similarly, <lb/>in the case of the 3:1 mixture of Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42), when <lb/>7% of tAβ(1-40) peptides were added to the sample, <lb/>the aggregation pathway was not significantly changed <lb/>compared to the native mixture. However, slower kinetics <lb/>were observed (lower plateau reached after 36 h instead <lb/>of 16 h for the native mixture; see Figure 1E compared <lb/>to Figure 1B). These results suggest that the nAβ(1-42) <lb/>peptide is driving the aggregation process: It rapidly <lb/>formed the nucleus (no lag phase) and the elongation step <lb/>was slowed by the tAβ(1-40). Likewise, when a fraction <lb/>of tAβ(1-42) was added to the mixture, the aggregation <lb/>mechanism resembled to the aggregation mechanism of <lb/>Aβ(1-40) solutions, that is, a lag phase was observed up to <lb/></body>

			<body>about 30 h and then the monomer population proportion <lb/>decreased until it reached a final plateau at about 60 h. <lb/>These observations confirmed that the tAβ(1-42) delayed <lb/>the formation of the Aβ(1-42) nucleus serving as a seed <lb/>for the elongation of Aβ(1-40). In a study by Zheng et al. <lb/>[9], the effect of several fluorescent tags, among which <lb/>FITC tag used in this work, on the aggregation process <lb/>of tAβ(1-42) was investigated using FCS. The authors <lb/>concluded that the FITC tag decreased the propensity of <lb/>oligomers to aggregate and they attributed this effect to the <lb/>increase of the peptide hydrophilicity by the fluorescent <lb/>tag. Further, it was reported that the nAß(1-42) monomer <lb/>and its fibrillary structures adopt compacted confor-<lb/>mations [25], in which the N-terminus is supposedly <lb/>water-shielded. In this work, the FITC tag can change <lb/>the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of the peptides, can <lb/>induce steric hindrance or may change the peptide con-<lb/>formation, leading to a lower propensity for aggregation. <lb/>For instance, it was reported in the literature that the <lb/>N-terminally truncated amyloid peptides were more prone <lb/>to aggregation than the full length ones [26-29] because <lb/>the truncated peptides would become more hydrophobic, <lb/>which supports that an increase in hydrophilicity at the <lb/>N-terminus region would impair the aggregation. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the hydrodynamic radii obtained for all <lb/>studied samples and for all populations obtained by decon-<lb/>volution of the UV elution profile. The monomers and low <lb/>molar mass oligomers have an R h of 1.60-2.25 nm which <lb/>was relatively constant during the whole aggregation pro-<lb/>cess (Figure 2, monomers). According to our previous <lb/>study, these values suggest that this population mainly <lb/>comprises monomers and dimers [13]. As for the higher <lb/>mass oligomer population, it varied from ∼4 to ∼30 nm for <lb/>all studied samples with an average value around 10 nm. <lb/>Then the R h of protofibrils ranged from 50 to 250 nm for all <lb/>studied systems. These results suggest that the fluorescent <lb/>tag did not influence the size of the different populations <lb/>when compared to native samples. <lb/>When a deeper look is taken at the higher mass oligomer <lb/>population for the 3:1 mixtures with and without tagged <lb/>peptides (Figure 6), the following observations could be <lb/>made: first, in the native peptides mixture, this population <lb/>increased in proportion and reached a maximum value <lb/>after 6 h incubation and then decreased and reached a <lb/>lower plateau after 15 h. Then, the addition of tAβ(1-40) <lb/>did not seem to significantly influence the evolution of <lb/>this population, which seemed to disappear after 24 h in <lb/>both cases (with and without tAβ(1-40)). Finally, when <lb/>tAβ(1-42) was added to the mixture, the bell-shaped dis-<lb/>tribution extended from 0 h up till 60 h with a maximum <lb/>reached around 30 h, suggesting that the oligomers are <lb/>more stabilized under these conditions. <lb/>F I G U R E 6 Peak area evolution of the higher molar mass <lb/>oligomer population obtained from the UV analysis of the Taylor <lb/>dispersion analysis (TDA) elution profile for 3:1 <lb/>Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -75% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42) (squares); 3:1 <lb/>Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -68% nAβ(1-40) + 7% nAβ(1-40) + 25% <lb/>nAβ(1-42) (circles); and 3:1 Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -75% <lb/>nAβ(1-40) + 15% nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42) (triangles). Peak area <lb/>was normalized, to obtain a better comparison of the species <lb/>evolution, by dividing the area of each data point to the total peak <lb/>area obtained for the first run at t ag = 0 h. <lb/>The comparison of the evolution of the monomer and <lb/>small oligomer populations, obtained from the elution pro-<lb/>files from the UV and the LEDIF detections (Figure 3), <lb/>showed no difference in the pathway between the tagged <lb/>peptide (selectively detected by LEDIF) and the total pep-<lb/>tides (detected by UV; composed of tagged and non-tagged <lb/>peptides), suggesting that the aggregation involves all the <lb/>different peptides at all steps and that the formed assem-<lb/>blies might be heteromolecular (mixture of Aβ(1-40) and <lb/>Aβ(1-42)). Figure 3C helps supporting this claim as a rapid <lb/>decrease of tAβ(1-42) is observed during the first hours of <lb/>incubation, probably corresponding to the formation of a <lb/>nucleus, followed by a plateau. Then, another decrease in <lb/>the tAβ(1-42) fraction is observed after about 24 h suggest-<lb/>ing the onset of the elongation phase with the participation <lb/>of the Aβ(1-40) (predominantly present in the sample) <lb/>where the decrease of the monomer population in UV is <lb/>observed as well. <lb/>4 <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>In this work, we showed the ability of TDA to follow <lb/>the aggregation process of labelled Aβ peptides by flu-<lb/>orescence detection and to study the effect of the label <lb/>on the aggregation propensity of amyloid peptides. It was <lb/></body>

			<body>found that at very low concentrations (lower than 10 µM), <lb/>the aggregation kinetics were drastically decreased and <lb/>the monitoring of the aggregation at these concentrations <lb/>would be a long process (days or weeks). To increase <lb/>the kinetics and the experimental throughput, the con-<lb/>centration was increased up to 100 µM with a certain <lb/>proportion of fluorescent-tagged peptides. At this concen-<lb/>tration, it was possible to monitor the aggregation process <lb/>of Aβ peptide mixtures in a reasonable amount of time. <lb/>Further, it was reported that the aggregation of Aβ(1-40) <lb/>and Aβ(1-42) was affected by a small proportion of FITC <lb/>label. The effect of the fluorescent tag was observed on <lb/>the elongation phase rather than on the nucleation one. <lb/>Further, in the case of Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) mixtures, when <lb/>the tagged peptide was Aβ(1-42), it was observed a higher <lb/>influence of the FITC label on the aggregation mechanism <lb/>than with the tAβ(1-40). As a consequence, the formed <lb/>oligomers in Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) mixtures (with a defined <lb/>proportion of tAβ(1-42)) had a substantial increase of their <lb/>lifetime and potentially of their toxicity. Finally, the com-<lb/>parison of both detection modes allowed to assume that <lb/>the aggregation mechanism was a heteromolecular pro-<lb/>cess involving both peptide isoforms and both tagged and <lb/>untagged peptides in the aggregates. In perspective, the <lb/>study of seeding at low Aβ concentrations and the effect of <lb/>the truncation on the aggregation process, monitored and <lb/>speciated by TDA would be an important input into the <lb/>huge amount of literature dealing with the aggregation of <lb/>amyloid peptides. <lb/></body>
