Here we investigated the clinical presentation and outcome <lb/>in a large cohort of 143 patients with pHLH diagnosed in the last 15 years and enrolled in the Italian registry. The median <lb/>age at diagnosis was 12 months (interquartile range, 2-81), and 92 patients (64%) fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria. Of 111 pa-<lb/>tients who received first-line combined therapy (HLH-94, HLH-2004, Euro-HIT protocols), 65 (59%) achieved complete <lb/>response and 21 (19%) partial response. Thereafter, 33 patients (30%) reactivated, and 92 (64%) received hematopoietic stem <lb/>cell transplantation, 78 of whom (85%) survived and were alive at a median follow-up from diagnosis of 67 months. Thirty-six <lb/>patients (25%) died before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 14 (10%) after. Overall, 93 patients (65%) were alive <lb/>after a median follow-up of 30 months. Unadjusted predictors of non-response were age &lt;6 months and high ferritin and <lb/>bilirubin levels, while predictors of pre-transplant and overall mortality were high ferritin and bilirubin levels. At multivari-<lb/>able analysis, high levels of ferritin predicted non-response, while high levels of bilirubin predicted pre-transplant and <lb/>overall mortality. Despite recent advances in therapeutic management, pHLH remains a life-threatening condition with <lb/>significant early mortality. Liver dysfunction is the main predictor of poor prognosis. <lb/>Correspondence: E.

        <body>Introduction <lb/>Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) is a <lb/>rare and severe genetic syndrome first described in 1952. 1 <lb/>It encompasses different monogenic disorders caused in <lb/>most cases by defects in genes of the granule-dependent <lb/>cytotoxic pathway of natural killer (NK) or CD8 T cells, <lb/>which were first described in the late &apos;90s. 2-6 Before that, <lb/>the diagnosis of pHLH relied on the presence of clinical and <lb/>laboratory criteria, the demonstration of deficient NK-cell <lb/></body>

        <body>function, and the anamnestic finding of familial recurrence <lb/>of the syndrome. Since the &quot;genetic era&quot;, pHLH is classified <lb/>as follows, based on the detected mutation: familial he-<lb/>mophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), defined by biallelic <lb/>mutations of PRF1 (FHL2), UNC13D (FHL3), STX11 (FHL4), <lb/>or STXBP2 (FHL5); pigmentary disorders associated with <lb/>HLH, defined by mutations of RAB27A (Griscelli syndrome <lb/>type 2, GS2), LYST (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, CHS), or <lb/>AP3B1 (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2, HPS2); X-linked <lb/>lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), caused by mutations <lb/>of SH2D1A (XLP1) or XIAP (XLP2). Other HLH-associated <lb/>syndromes include gain-of-function mutations of NLRC4, <lb/>CDC42 heterozygous mutations, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <lb/>susceptibility diseases other than XLP, primary immune <lb/>deficiencies, and inborn errors of metabolism. 7,8 <lb/>The clinical presentation of pHLH is indistinguishable from <lb/>that of secondary HLH, and includes fever, cytopenias, and <lb/>hepatosplenomegaly in most cases. Involvement of the cen-<lb/>tral nervous system (CNS) and multiorgan failure (typically <lb/>affecting the liver) are also common. Typical laboratory <lb/>abnormalities include low fibrinogen, high triglycerides, <lb/>and abnormal elevation of ferritin and soluble IL2 recep-<lb/>tor (sIL2R). Moreover, before genetic testing is performed, <lb/>pHLH in patients with FHL2-5 or pigmentary disorders <lb/>can be postulated based on the demonstration by flow <lb/>cytometry of impaired either intracytoplasmic perforin or <lb/>surface CD107a expression by NK and CTL cell. 9 <lb/>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the on-<lb/>ly curative treatment for pHLH. A chemotherapy regimen <lb/>based on the combination of etoposide and dexamethasone <lb/>has been developed in two consecutive trials promoted by <lb/>the Histiocyte Society as a bridge to HSCT, 10,11 and is now <lb/>considered the standard of care for the disease. Alterna-<lb/>tive therapeutic strategies include an immunotherapeutic <lb/>approach based on antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and meth-<lb/>ylprednisolone 12 and, more recently, biologic drugs such as <lb/>alemtuzumab, 13 emapalumab, 14 and ruxolitinib. 15 Nevertheless, <lb/>pHLH remains a difficult-to-treat disease with high early <lb/>mortality and long-term disabilities. <lb/>In the last decades, there has been a rapid evolution of <lb/>diagnostic strategies, allowing more rapid genetic diagnosis <lb/>in patients with HLH syndrome. However, many aspects of <lb/>the syndrome, in terms of presentation and outcome of <lb/>the genetic forms, remain to be understood. Herein, we <lb/>analyzed a large cohort of patients with pHLH diagnosed <lb/>in the last 15 years and enrolled in the Italian HLH registry, <lb/>to analyze their clinical presentation and long-term out-<lb/>come. In addition, we sought to identify predictors of poor <lb/>response and of early and late mortality. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study population <lb/>Clinical data and biologic samples from patients who re-<lb/>ceived a diagnosis of HLH 16 are collected in the Italian HLH <lb/>registry held at the Meyer Children&apos;s Hospital in Florence, <lb/>Italy. For the purposes of the present study, we retrieved the <lb/>registry data on patients who received a genetic diagnosis <lb/>of pHLH in the last 15 years. Data on genetic testing are <lb/>reported in the Online Supplementary Appendix. Patients <lb/>diagnosed after 2007 were eligible for study inclusion if <lb/>they had available data on clinical and laboratory presen-<lb/>tation, and outcome, with a minimum follow-up duration <lb/>of 12 months. Patients referred to our laboratory from <lb/>other countries or with unavailable follow-up data were <lb/>excluded. Although most patients included in the registry <lb/>were infants or children, also adults were considered for <lb/>study inclusion if they met the inclusion criteria. <lb/>Data collection <lb/>Baseline data included demographics, family history, and <lb/>clinical features of patients at diagnosis. The complete <lb/>laboratory assessment, as recommended by the HLH-<lb/>2004 diagnostic criteria (full blood count, liver enzymes, <lb/>triglycerides, fibrinogen, ferritin, sIL2) was also included. <lb/>Follow-up data included information on treatment received <lb/>(including HSCT), response to treatment, disease reacti-<lb/>vation, sequelae, and the status at the last follow-up. All <lb/>these data were pseudo-anonymized, collected in dedicated <lb/>forms, and stored in an electronic, password-protected <lb/>database. Response to first-line treatment was catego-<lb/>rized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), <lb/>and non-response (NR). Details on outcome definition are <lb/>provided in the Online Supplementary Appendix. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Continuous variables were presented as median and <lb/>interquartile range (IQR) while categorical variables as <lb/>absolute number and percentage. For continuous vari-<lb/>ables, multiple-group comparisons were performed by the <lb/>Kruskal-Wallis test, while for two-group comparisons the <lb/>Mann-Whitney U test was used. For the analysis of fre-<lb/>quency, statistical analyses were performed using χ 2 test, if <lb/>applicable, or Fisher&apos;s exact test with the associated odds <lb/>ratio (OR). For each OR, a 95% confidence interval (95% <lb/>CI) was applied. For tables larger than 2X2, Fisher&apos;s exact <lb/>test with hybrid approximation and Monte Carlo simula-<lb/>tion were used to compute the P value. For time-to-event <lb/>(survival analysis) we designed Kaplan-Meier curves with <lb/>the log-rank test. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards <lb/>regression model was used for multivariate analysis. For <lb/>multivariate analyses, we also applied generalized linear <lb/>models (binomial and Gaussian family). Some continuous <lb/>variables were binarized by drawing a ROC curve using <lb/>the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity to obtain <lb/>an optimal threshold or applying a threshold based on <lb/>relevant clinical values. Two-sided P&lt;0.05 was considered <lb/>significant. Statistical analysis was performed using R <lb/>software version 4.2.2. <lb/></body>

        <body>ARTICLE -Outcome of primary HLH in Italy <lb/>F. Pegoraro et al. <lb/>Ethics statement <lb/>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declara-<lb/>tion of Helsinki and its later amendments. 17 Written informed <lb/>consent was obtained for all patients included in the registry. <lb/>Results <lb/>Three hundred and eighty-one patients with pHLH were <lb/>included in the Italian HLH registry. Of them, 116 were <lb/>excluded because they were diagnosed before 2007, 42 <lb/>because they were not followed in a national center, 63 <lb/>because of insufficient follow-up data, 12 because they <lb/>had received a post mortem diagnosis, and five because <lb/>of a revision of the genetic diagnosis. Finally, 143 patients <lb/>were included in the study (Table 1). <lb/>Patients&apos; characteristics at diagnosis <lb/>The baseline characteristics of the 143 included patients <lb/>are detailed in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was <lb/>12 months (interquartile range [IQR], 2-81). While most <lb/>patients were diagnosed before the second year of life, 14 <lb/>patients (10%) were older than 14 years at diagnosis and 11 <lb/>(8%) were adults. Around two thirds of patients were males <lb/>(N=88, 62%). They were in most cases of Caucasian origin <lb/>(N=113, 79%), while the remaining patients originated from <lb/>North Africa (N=12, 8%), the Indian subcontient (N=9, 6%), <lb/>Latin America, Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa (N=3, <lb/>2%, for each of them). Thirty patients (21%) had related <lb/>parents, and 38 (27%) had familial disease. <lb/>Ninety-two patients (64%) fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria at <lb/>diagnosis. 16 A hundred and twenty-eight patients (90%) had <lb/>fever, 120 (84%) splenomegaly, and 84 (59%) hepatomegaly. <lb/>CNS involvement (defined as neurological impairment and/ <lb/>or abnormalities at magnetic resonance imaging or cere-<lb/>brospinal fluid analysis) was reported in 49 patients (34%). <lb/>At least bilinear cytopenia was found in 97 patients (68%): <lb/>the median hemoglobin level was 8 g/dL (IQR, 7.7-10), the <lb/>median neutrophil count 7.6x10 9 /L (IQR, 0.33-1.72), and the <lb/>median platelet count 48x10 9 /L (IQR, 24-100). Seventy-two <lb/>patients (50%) had liver enzyme abnormalities: the median <lb/>aspartate and alanine aminotransferase values were 164 <lb/>and 132 U/L (IQR, 66-386 and 56-279, respectively), and <lb/>the median value of total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL (IQR, 0.5-2.9). <lb/>The median values of ferritin, triglycerides, and fibrinogen <lb/>were 2,538 ng/mL (IQR, 1,061-11,550), 278 mg/dL (IQR, 185-<lb/>428), and 121 mg/dL (IQR, 80-228), respectively. Infectious <lb/>triggers were detected in 42 patients (29%) and mostly <lb/>consisted of EBV (N=21, 50%) and cytomegalovirus (N=4, <lb/>10%). Four patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed <lb/>based on familial screening. <lb/>Genetic diagnosis <lb/>The genetic diagnoses of the 143 patients are reported in <lb/>Figure 1. Forty-seven patients (33%) had FHL2, 41 (29%) <lb/>FHL3, two (1%) FHL4, 15 (11%) FHL5, 12 (8%) XLP1, nine <lb/>(6%) XLP2, eight (6%) CHS, and nine (6%) GS2. We found <lb/>Table 1.

        <body>differences in baseline characteristics depending on the <lb/>genetic diagnosis (Online Supplementary Table S1; Online <lb/>Supplementary Figure S2) in terms of sex, age at diagnosis, <lb/>consanguinity, and severity of clinical presentation (includ-<lb/>ing the prevalence of complete HLH criteria, hematologic <lb/>abnormalities, ferritin and ALT values, and infectious trig-<lb/>gers). In particular, patients with XLP had higher age and <lb/>lower rates of hematologic involvement at diagnosis (higher <lb/>platelet and neutrophil count, lower rates of cytopenia). <lb/>When we analyzed the distribution of the genetic diagnosis <lb/>in three age groups (0-6 months, 7-24 months, and &gt;24 <lb/>months; Online Supplementary Figure S1), the proportion <lb/>of patients with FHL2 and FHL3 remained stable in the <lb/>three age groups, while most patients with XLP were older <lb/>than 2 years, and patients with FHL5, CHS, and GS2 were <lb/>typically younger. <lb/>Response to treatment <lb/>Thirteen patients (9%) did not receive any treatment, ei-<lb/>ther for the rapidly fatal outcome (N=5), a mild clinical <lb/>presentation (N=3), or the absence of symptoms (N=5). <lb/>First-line therapies in the 130 treated patients included <lb/>chemotherapy according to the HLH-94 10 and HLH-2004 11 <lb/>trials in 29 (22%) and 75 (58%) patients, respectively, while <lb/>seven patients (5%) were included in the Euro-HIT trial <lb/>(EUDRACT2011-002052-14).

        <body>The overall response rate to chemotherapy was 78% (86/111; <lb/>Figure 2). CR was documented in 65 of 111 patients and PR <lb/>in 21 additional patients (Online Supplementary Table S2). <lb/>In 11 of these patients, additional treatment was required: <lb/>rituximab in four patients with EBV infection, ATG, ruxoli-<lb/>tinib, and infusion of maternal NK cells in two each, and <lb/>tacrolimus in one. Twenty-five of 111 patients (22%) did <lb/>not respond to chemotherapy: one received emapalumab <lb/>as salvage therapy and was successfully transplanted, the <lb/>remaining 24 patients (including 4 patients who respond-<lb/>ed to re-intensification therapy but reactivated), died at a <lb/>median follow-up of 1 month (IQR, 0-3) (Figure 2). Among <lb/>patients who received a steroid-based treatment, 16 of <lb/>19 (84%) responded (11 CR, 5 PR), and five died. Of note, <lb/>all these five patients had severe central nervous system <lb/>(CNS) involvement at diagnosis. <lb/>Eight patients were not treated either because they refused <lb/>treatment (N=1), were asymptomatic (the 4 patients diag-<lb/>nosed due to familial screening), or paucisymptomatic (N=3); <lb/>these latter patients were transplanted and were alive at <lb/>a median follow-up of 28 months (IQR, 23-67) (Figure 2). <lb/>No significant differences in terms of response to treat-<lb/>ment or survival were detected depending on the received <lb/>therapeutic protocol (Online Supplementary Table S2), but <lb/>patients who responded to first-line treatment had older <lb/>age, higher platelets, and lower ferritin values at diagnosis <lb/>(Figure 3). <lb/>Reactivation <lb/>Thirty-three of 100 (33%) patients who responded to treat-<lb/>ment reactivated, at a median time from diagnosis of 6 <lb/>months (IQR, 3-11). Of them, 23 patients responded to <lb/>first-line chemotherapy and then reactivated at a me-<lb/>dian time from diagnosis of 5.5 months (IQR, 2.5-9): one <lb/>child died for abrupt disease progression without receiving <lb/>treatment, while six received frontline HSCT and were all <lb/>alive at last follow-up except for one patient that died for <lb/>disease progression despite HSCT (Figure 2).

        <body>Nine of them were transplanted and eight survived, while <lb/>six of the seven patients who did not receive HSCT died <lb/>(Figure 2). In four patients, after initial non-response to <lb/>chemotherapy, partial disease control was obtained after <lb/>re-intensification treatment, but they rapidly reactivated: <lb/>two received HSCT but all four eventually died at a median <lb/>time from diagnosis of 4.5 months (IQR, 2-6; Online Supple-<lb/>mentary Table S3; Figure 2). Six patients reactivated after <lb/>steroid treatment and received second-line treatment, and <lb/>four of them were transplanted; all six were alive after a <lb/>median follow-up duration of 61 months (IQR, 32-64). The <lb/>reactivation-free survival of the study cohort is reported in <lb/>Figure 4. No differences in reactivation-free survival were <lb/>found according to the genetic diagnosis and the study <lb/>period (Online Supplementary Figures S3-5). <lb/>Transplantation <lb/>Ninety-two of 143 patients (64%) received HSCT, at a me-<lb/>dian time from diagnosis of 5 months (IQR, 4-8.5). Four <lb/>of them required a second HSCT for graft loss, and one <lb/>an additional third transplant. Among the 92 transplanted <lb/>patients, 78 patients (85%) survived and were alive at a <lb/>median time of 67 months (IQR, 34-106) from diagnosis <lb/>and 56 months (IQR, 25-97) from HSCT (Figure 4). Of the <lb/>14 patients who died after HSCT, three were transplanted <lb/>due to treatment failure and died from disease progression, <lb/>and 11 for transplant-related mortality. Patients who were <lb/>able to receive HSCT were older and had higher platelet <lb/>counts and lower bilirubin values at diagnosis (Figure 3). <lb/>Interestingly, 15 patients (10%) did not receive HSCT and <lb/>were alive at a median follow-up duration of 34 months <lb/>(IQR, 13-55; Online Supplementary Table S4). Ten patients <lb/>responded to first-line treatment, including four patients <lb/>who reactivated and then responded to second-line treat-<lb/>ment. Five patients did not receive any treatment: four <lb/>were diagnosed due to familial screening and remained <lb/>disease-free through follow-up, while one patient with <lb/>isolated CNS disease refused treatment and was lost after <lb/>follow-up at 14 months. <lb/>Survival <lb/>Ninety-three patients (65%) were alive at the last follow-up <lb/>(Figure 4). The median follow-up duration was 30 months <lb/>(IQR, 6-74) in the whole cohort and 57 months (IQR, 29-<lb/>97) for patients alive at the last follow-up. Among the 50 <lb/>patients who died, five (10%) did not receive treatment <lb/>because they died within day 30 from diagnosis, and five <lb/>(10%) received only steroids (median time to death 1 month; <lb/>IQR, 1-6). The remaining 40 patients received chemotherapy <lb/>(9 HLH-94, 28 HLH-2004, and 3 Euro-HIT). Among these 40 <lb/>patients, 16 died after initial response to first-line treat-<lb/>ment (9 for transplant-related mortality, 6 after disease <lb/>reactivation, and 1 for severe CNS disease), while 24 did <lb/>not respond and died at a median time from diagnosis <lb/>of 1 month (IQR, 0-3) for disease progression (Figure 2). <lb/>Thirty-six patients of 143 (25%) died before receiving HSCT <lb/>(Figure 4).

        <body>ectomy in one and requiring long-term parenteral nutrition <lb/>in both (these patients had XLP2 and FHL4, respectively); <lb/>two had liver function impairment, requiring liver trans-<lb/>plant in one of them, two had chronic kidney disease, and <lb/>one pulmonary hypertension; two patients had peripheral <lb/>nervous system impairment, while six patients had CNS <lb/>complications (paresis in two, and intellectual delay and <lb/>epilepsy in one each; the remaining two patients had fa-<lb/>tal spastic tetraplegia). Finally, one patient had prolonged <lb/>hypogammaglobulinemia and one osteoporosis. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Primary HLH is a severe condition that carries a high burden <lb/>of early mortality and long-term complications. The clinical <lb/>course of pHLH can be misleading, and its management is <lb/>critical. 8 In this study, we describe the presentation and <lb/>investigate the long-term outcome of a large cohort of pa-<lb/>tients with pHLH and identify predictors of non-response <lb/>and mortality. <lb/>In historic cohorts, most pHLH patients were diagnosed <lb/>within the first year of age, but in recent years the rate <lb/>of diagnosis in older children -or even in adults -has in-<lb/>creased. 18,19 Similarly, in our cohort, only half the patients <lb/>were younger than 1 year at diagnosis, and 10% of them <lb/>were adolescents or adults. This data is probably due to <lb/>the improvement of familial screening but also reflects an <lb/>increased awareness of this condition outside the pediatric <lb/>domain. Moreover, compared to previous studies, 7 we report <lb/>a higher rate of XLP, accounting for around 12% of patients <lb/>in our cohort. These patients were older at diagnosis and <lb/>had less hematologic involvement at presentation. Thus, <lb/>unsurprisingly, the proportion of patients presenting with <lb/>the traditional combination of HLH-related symptoms was <lb/>lower compared to data from an older international cohort 20 <lb/>and from large international HLH studies. 11,21 <lb/>With regard to treatment, two large international trials <lb/>coordinated by the Histiocyte Society 11,21 have defined the <lb/>standard of care, providing the first, marked improvement <lb/>of survival of patients with HLH. Yet, HLH-2004 did not pro-<lb/>vide any further improvement compared with HLH-94, with <lb/>mortality rate remaining up to about 35%. Thus, HLH-94 <lb/>remained the standard of care. In our study, most patients <lb/>received one of the two standard chemotherapy regimens, <lb/>HLH-94 or HLH-2004. Not surprisingly, overall survival and <lb/>early mortality rates did not differ from the study results, to <lb/>which those patients largely contributed. Two more recent <lb/>Turkish studies on pHLH reported higher mortality rates, of <lb/>63% 22 and 81%. 19 Compared to the HLH-94 and HLH-2004 <lb/>studies, we found a lower rate of post-transplant mortality <lb/>(15% vs. 34% and 30%, respectively), which probably par-<lb/>tially reflects the improvement of transplant procedures <lb/>and supportive care in more recent years. <lb/>A minority of patients received novel treatments (i.e., <lb/>emapalumab, ruxolitinib, and alemtuzumab) at reactiva-<lb/>tion, and these molecules were effective in most cases. <lb/>However, we were unable to properly evaluate their im-<lb/>pact due to the limited number of treated patients. In <lb/>contrast, patients not responding to first-line treatment <lb/>experienced adverse outcomes in almost all cases, even <lb/>those few patients who were able to receive second-line <lb/>treatment (only 1 patient was successfully rescued using <lb/>emapalumab). This subgroup of patients is more likely to <lb/>benefit from alternative treatments. <lb/>Thus, early identification of a subset of HLH patients at <lb/>highest risk who could benefit from alternative therapeu-<lb/>tic approaches remains of interest. Data from the HLH-94 <lb/>study indicated that jaundice, edema, and kidney function <lb/>abnormalities were associated with early mortality. 21 Ad-<lb/>ditional analysis of the same study reported bilirubin &gt;50 <lb/>μmol/L, hyperferritinemia, and CSF pleocytosis as adjusted <lb/>predictors of early mortality. 23 More recently, a monocentric <lb/>Turkish study identified hepatic involvement as associat-<lb/>ed, at unadjusted analysis, with inferior 5-year survival in <lb/>patients with pHLH younger than 2 years. 19 In the present <lb/>study, we analyzed predictors of non-response to first-line <lb/>treatment, and of pre-transplant and overall mortality in <lb/>patients with pHLH. Younger age at diagnosis was signifi-<lb/>cantly associated with non-response, while higher ferritin <lb/>values were associated with non-response, pre-transplant, <lb/>and overall mortality. Of note, the ferritin cut-off of 2,000 <lb/>ng/mL previously used by Trottestam et al. 23 did not reach <lb/>statistical significance in our cohort, probably depending <lb/>Table 3.

        <body>on the different study population (HLH vs. pHLH). Moreover, <lb/>bilirubin values &gt;2 mg/dL were significantly associated with <lb/>all three outcomes. At multivariable analysis, liver dysfunc-<lb/>tion, demonstrated by hyperbilirubinemia, was confirmed <lb/>as a reliable predictor of early and overall mortality, and <lb/>high burden of inflammation, suggested by hyperferritin-<lb/>emia, predicted non-response to first-line treatment. In <lb/>contrast, we did not confirm the association between CNS <lb/>involvement and outcome, while data on kidney function <lb/>were not analyzed. <lb/>HSCT is considered the only curative treatment for pHLH. <lb/>In previous studies, the finding of pHLH patients surviving <lb/>without HSCT was anecdotic (2/168 in the HLH-2004 study, <lb/>both harboring a p.Ala91Val PRF1 mutation; and none in the <lb/>60 pHLH patients enrolled in the HLH-94 study). Unexpect-<lb/>edly, 15 patients (10%) in the present series were alive at <lb/>a median follow-up of 34 months without receiving HSCT. <lb/>Out of them, four were asymptomatic and diagnosed due <lb/>to familial screening: they neither developed HLH nor re-<lb/>ceived HLH-directed treatments, at a time to last follow-up <lb/>ranging from 12 to 105 months. One patient with isolated <lb/>CNS disease refused treatment, while the remaining ten <lb/>patients responded to first line HLH-directed treatment <lb/>and remained disease free after 13 to 86 months. <lb/>Overall, our study included a large pHLH cohort, diagnosed <lb/>over the last 15 years, allowing us to depict an updated <lb/>picture of the genetic subtype distribution and the out-<lb/>come of patients with pHLH in Italy. However, we must <lb/>acknowledge that this study has limitations. First, to in-<lb/>clude such a large number, an extended time interval is <lb/>embraced during which medical and transplant practices <lb/>have changed. However, since the second therapeutic study <lb/>HLH-2004 has not shown a significant improvement in <lb/>treatment results, accumulation of the two cohorts should <lb/>not result in a significant bias in outcome and prognos-<lb/>tic investigation. When looking at diagnostic studies, the <lb/>diagnostic criteria have remained unchanged, but we se-<lb/>lected patients based on genetic diagnoses. It has to be <lb/>acknowledged that a minority of the included patients had <lb/>mutations with a debatable pathogenicity, but in these cases <lb/>the genetic diagnosis was supported by abnormal func-<lb/>tional studies and/or stringent clinical criteria (HLH-2004). <lb/>These patients were clinically managed as pHLH and were <lb/>therefore included in the analyses of the present study. Of <lb/>note, we also included ten patients harboring homozygous <lb/>or compound heterozygous A91V PRF1 mutations, whose <lb/>pathogenicity is still debated. However, while four of them <lb/>were alive without HSCT, three received HSCT for active <lb/>HLH and three died before being able to be transplanted. <lb/>Although it increases the heterogeneity of the cohort, we <lb/>believe that reporting these patients could support clinical <lb/>management in these ambiguous cases. <lb/>In conclusion, pHLH is a rare and very severe inheritable <lb/>condition that still carries an invariably dismal prognosis, if <lb/>not rapidly and appropriately identified and treated. Patients <lb/>failing to achieve disease control with first-line treatment <lb/>remain at highest risk of fatal outcome. These patients <lb/>usually present with high levels of ferritin and bilirubin, <lb/>and an early shift to alternative approaches including new <lb/>agents, appears warranted. For patients achieving disease <lb/>control allowing HSCT, improved transplant skills may offer <lb/>a higher chance of cure. Identification of the small subset <lb/>of patients with pHLH with potential to maintain disease <lb/>control after initial therapy even without HSCT, may profit <lb/>from a careful, pin-point analysis, maybe supported also <lb/>by an accurate genotype-phenotype study. <lb/></body>
