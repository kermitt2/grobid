			We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of body fat distribution, measured by <lb/>waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), and identified 463 signals in 346 loci. Heritability <lb/>and variant effects were generally stronger in women than men, and the 5% of individuals carrying <lb/>the most WHRadjBMI-increasing alleles were ~1.62 times more likely than the bottom 5% to have a <lb/>WHR above the thresholds used for metabolic syndrome. These data, made publically available, will <lb/>inform the biology of body fat distribution and its relationship with disease. <lb/></front>

			<body>One in four adults worldwide are either overweight or obese 1,2 and are at increased risk of metabolic <lb/>disease. While higher adiposity increases morbidity and mortality, 1,3 epidemiological studies indicate <lb/>that the location and distribution of excess fat within particular depots is more informative than general <lb/>adiposity for predicting disease risk. Independent of their overall body mass index (BMI), individuals with <lb/>higher central adiposity have increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) <lb/>and stroke 4,5 ; in contrast, individuals with higher gluteal adiposity have lower risk of such outcomes. 5 <lb/>Previous studies indicate that fat distribution, as assessed by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), is a trait with a <lb/>strong heritable component, independent of overall adiposity (measured by BMI) 5,6 , and recent Mendelian <lb/>randomisation studies using known WHR-associated genetic variants showed putative causal effects of <lb/>higher WHR on T2D and coronary artery disease independently of BMI. 7 <lb/>With the goal of pinpointing genetic variants associated to body shape and fat distribution, and motivated <lb/>by the recent release of genetic data from half a million individuals, 8 we performed a meta-analysis of <lb/>WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). WHRadjBMI is an easily-measured fat distribution phenotype that <lb/>correlates well with imaging-based fat distribution measures. 9 We performed genome-wide association <lb/>studies (GWAS) of WHRadjBMI in the UK Biobank data set, 8 a collection of 484,563 individuals with <lb/>densely-imputed genotype data, using a linear mixed model 10 to account for relatedness and ancestral <lb/>heterogeneity. We then combined the results with publicly-available GWAS data generated by the GIANT <lb/>consortium for the same phenotype (Table 1 and Methods) 5 , resulting in a meta-analysis of 694,649 <lb/>samples (Table 1) and ~27.4M SNPs (Methods). As a sensitivity analysis and to evaluate the robustness <lb/>of our results, we also performed a GWAS of WHR unadjusted for BMI (Table 1). <lb/>We identified 346 loci (300 novel) containing 463 independent signals associated with WHRadjBMI (p &lt; 5 <lb/>x 10 -9 , to account for the denser imputation data 11 ; Methods, Supplementary Table 1 and <lb/>Supplementary Fig 1). The Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Score Regression 12 intercept (1.0346) of the <lb/>meta-analysis results indicated that the observed enrichment in genomic signal was primarily due to <lb/>polygenicity and not confounding (Supplementary Table 2). Of the 300 novel signals, 234 (78%, pbinomial&lt;1 <lb/>x 10 -7 ) were directionally-consistent in an independent dataset with a relatively small sample size (N = <lb/>7,721) and signals were consistent in several sensitivity checks (Supplementary Tables 3-5 and <lb/>Supplementary Fig 2-3). These variants combined explained ~3.9% of the variance in WHRadjBMI in the <lb/>independent study (Methods and Table 1). We constructed a weighted polygenic score using the 346 <lb/>index SNPs discovered in the combined meta-analysis and tested this score in the same independent <lb/>study. The 5% of individuals carrying the most WHRadjBMI-raising alleles were approximately 1.62 times <lb/>more likely to meet the WHR threshold for metabolic syndrome 13 than the 5% carrying the fewest <lb/>(Methods). <lb/>A number of analyses indicated that the majority of signals identified have genuine effects on body shape <lb/>and that any bias caused by adjusting WHR for a correlated covariate (BMI) 14,15 was minimal. Of the 346 <lb/>index variants, 311 were associated with stronger standard deviation effect sizes for WHR (unadjusted) <lb/>than with standard deviation effect sizes for BMI (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig 4). <lb/>This analysis also indicates that the WHR association is unlikely to be secondary to the known effect of <lb/>higher BMI leading to higher WHR. Furthermore, the common SNP associated with the largest known <lb/>effect on BMI, that in the FTO gene, was not associated with WHRadjBMI (rs1421085, p = 0.40), despite <lb/>a very strong association with WHR (4 x 10 -118 ). Finally, carrying each additional WHRadjBMI-raising allele <lb/>(weighted) was associated with 0.0199 SD higher WHRadjBMI (p = 6 x 10 -62 ; adjusted R 2 = 4%), 0.0111 SD <lb/>higher WHR (unadjusted; p = 3 x 10 -20 ; adjusted R 2 = 0.12%) and 0.0038 SD lower BMI (P-value = 0.0014; <lb/>adjusted R 2 = 0.13%) in our independent dataset (consistent with the results obtained from an unweighted <lb/>polygenic score; Methods). <lb/>Given the sex-dimorphism of fat distribution in humans, previously shown to have a genetic basis 5 , we <lb/>next performed meta-analyses of WHRadjBMI in women and men separately (Table 1 and Supplementary <lb/>Fig 5). We found SNP-based heritability (ℎ 𝑔 <lb/>2 ) of WHRadjBMI, estimated using the restricted maximum <lb/>likelihood method implemented in BOLT-REML 10 (Methods), to be stronger in women (ℎ 𝑔 <lb/>2 = 25.6%) <lb/>compared to men (ℎ 𝑔 <lb/>2 = 16.7%, pdifference = 9 x 10 -85 ; Table 1, Supplementary Table 6, and Equation 2). In <lb/>addition to the heritability dimorphism, and in keeping with previous studies 5 , we found signatures of <lb/>sex-dimorphism amongst associated loci: a total of 266 loci associated with WHRadjBMI in women, <lb/>compared to 91 loci in men (p &lt; 5 x 10 -9 ). The consistency between the effect size of 266 female index <lb/>SNPs on WHRadjBMI in women and men (slope = 0.31; p = 2 x 10 -33 ; adjusted R 2 = 51%) was greater than <lb/>the consistency between the effect size of 91 male index SNPs on WHRadjBMI in men and women (slope <lb/>= 0.20; p = 0.002; adjusted R 2 = 9%). Of all associated index SNPs (p &lt; 5 x 10 -9 in the combined or sex-<lb/>specific analyses), 105 SNPs were sex-dimorphic (pdiff 16 &lt; 3.3 x 10 -5 ; Methods). Variants discovered in the <lb/>combined sex analysis, will be enriched for those with similar effects in each sex, and variants discovered <lb/>in sex-specific analyses will be enriched for those with different effects between sexes. In the absence <lb/>of any sex-specific effects, we would only expect a slight shift towards stronger associations in women <lb/>because the sample size for women was slightly larger. However, we observed that of the 105 sex-<lb/>dimorphic signals, 97 (92.4%) showed stronger effects in women compared to men (Figure 1, <lb/>Supplementary Fig 6, and Methods). <lb/>Previous studies have shown that in addition to redistributing body fat, some WHRadjBMI variants are <lb/>also associated with total body fat percentage (BF%) 5,17-19 . Of relevance to the biology of adipose tissue <lb/>storage capacity, these studies have shown that these pleiotropic associations can occur in both <lb/>directions -some alleles associated with higher WHRadjBMI are associated with higher total BF%, whilst <lb/>others are associated with lower BF%. 5,17-19 To test the hypothesis that alleles associated with higher <lb/>WHRadjBMI could have pleiotropic effects on total BF%, and that these effects could occur in both <lb/>directions, we next investigated whether the 346 index variants associated with WHRadjBMI also <lb/>associated with BF%. Of the 59/346 variants associated with BF% in 443,001 European-ancestry UK <lb/>Biobank individuals (p &lt; 0.05/346 = 1.44 x 10 -4 ), 25 alleles were associated with higher WHR and higher <lb/>BF%, whilst 34 alleles were associated with higher WHR but lower BF% (Supplementary Fig 7). <lb/>Additionally, a large proportion (29%) of WHRadjBMI index SNPs with a stronger effect in women had a <lb/>BF% phenotype in men (28 of the 97 female-specific WHRadjBMI SNPs were associated with BF% in men <lb/>and 25 were associated with BF% in women (p &lt; 0.05/105 = 4.8 x 10 -4 )) (Supplementary Fig 8). These <lb/>variants appear to alter total BF% in men and women to a similar extent, but distribute body fat between <lb/>the upper and lower body to a much greater extent in women (Supplementary Table 7-9 and <lb/>Supplementary Fig 8). Finally, we tested the index SNPs from each of the meta-analyses (combined and <lb/>sex-specific) in a recent GWAS of CT and MRI image based measures of ectopic and subcutaneous fat <lb/>depots. 20 Adjusting for the three sample groups and the 8 depots examined in the imaging-based GWAS <lb/>(p &lt; 0.05/24 = 2.1 x 10 -3 ), the alleles associated with higher WHRadjBMI were collectively associated with <lb/>lower measures of subcutaneous fat, and higher measures of visceral fat, including pericardial and <lb/>visceral adipose tissue (Supplementary Fig. 9). <lb/>While we have performed the largest meta-analysis of a measure of body-fat distribution to date, a <lb/>number of limitations remain. First, the substantially larger number of signals with a stronger effect in <lb/>women compared to men may be influenced by the smaller sample size in the men-only analysis (Table <lb/>1), although we would not expect the difference in sample size to result in 92% of signals being stronger <lb/>in women. Second, our replication sample was too small (~1% of the discovery) to formally replicate <lb/>individual SNP associations, but the fact that 78% of the 300 previously unknown index associations <lb/>showed consistent direction of effect suggests a low false positive rate. Finally, our meta-analysis focused <lb/>only on European-ancestry samples. Given the very different body-fat distributions between people of <lb/>European and non-European ancestry, and their very different risks of adiposity-related disease, studies <lb/>in non-Europeans are urgently needed. 21,22 <lb/>In summary, the genetic variants and loci identified by this meta-analysis will likely provide starting <lb/>points for further understanding the biology of body fat distribution and its relationship with disease. <lb/>

			Tables and Figures <lb/>Table 1 | Large-scale meta-analysis in body fat distribution. We performed a meta-analysis of fat <lb/>distribution as measured by WHRadjBMI in up to 694,649 individuals. We performed analyses of WHR as <lb/>a sensitivity measure. Our analyses increase the number of WHRadjBMI-associated loci (p &lt; 5 x 10 -9 , to <lb/>account for SNP density in UK Biobank) to 346 loci. SNP-based heritability (𝒉 𝒈 <lb/>𝟐 ) results (estimated using <lb/>the restricted maximum likelihood method implemented in BOLT-REML 10 (Methods)) and top-associated <lb/>loci indicate patterns of sex-dimorphism.

			<div type="annex">Phenotypes <lb/>To generate phenotypes for the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass <lb/>index (WHRadjBMI) analyses in the UK Biobank data (Supplementary Table 10), we followed a phenotype <lb/>conversion consistent with that performed in previous efforts investigating WHR and WHRadjBMI by the <lb/>GIANT consortium. 5,23 Using phenotype information from UK Biobank, we divided waist circumference by <lb/>hip circumference to calculate the WHR measure, and then regressed the WHR measure on age at <lb/>assessment, age at assesment squared, and assessment centre. To generate the WHRadjBMI phenotype, <lb/>we followed the same procedure and included body mass index (BMI) as an additional independent <lb/>variable in the regression. We performed rank inverse normalization on the resulting residuals from the <lb/>regression (Supplementary Fig 10), and used these normalized residuals as the tested phenotype in <lb/>downstream genome-wide association testing. To generate phenotypes for the sex-specific analyses, we <lb/>followed this same procedure but ran the regressions in sex-specific groups. <lb/>Genome-wide association analyses <lb/>The UK Biobank data <lb/>We conducted genome-wide association testing in the second release (June 2017) version of the UK <lb/>Biobank data 8 ; this release did not contain the corrected imputation at non-Haplotype Reference <lb/>Consortium (HRC 24 ) sites and we therefore subsetted all of the SNP data down to HRC SNPs only. The UK <lb/>Biobank applied quality control to samples and genotypes, and imputed the resulting genotype data using <lb/>sequencing-based imputation reference panels. We performed all of our genome-wide association testing <lb/>and downstream analyses on the publicly-available imputation data (released in bgen format). <lb/>We excluded samples as suggested by the UK Biobank upon release of the data (Supplementary Table <lb/>11). Sample exclusions included samples with genotype but no imputation information, samples with <lb/>missingness &gt; 5%, samples with mismatching phenotypic and genotypic sex, and samples that have <lb/>withdrawn consent since the initiation of the project. <lb/>LD scores and genetic relationship matrix for BOLT-LMM <lb/>We implemented all genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in BOLT-LMM 10 , which performs association <lb/>testing using a linear mixed model. To run, BOLT-LMM requires three primary components: the (imputed) <lb/>genotypic data for association testing; a reference panel of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) scores per SNP, <lb/>calculated using LD Score Regression 12 ; and genotype data used to approximate a genetic relationship <lb/>matrix (GRM), which is the best method available in this sample size to account for all forms of <lb/>relatedness, ancestral heterogeneity in the samples, and other (potentially hidden) structure in the data. <lb/>We performed sensitivity testing (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Tables 12-13 and <lb/>Supplementary Fig 11) using three LD Score reference datasets and four SNP-sets to construct the GRM. <lb/>For our final GWAS, we used LD scores calculated from a randomly-selected, 9,748 unrelated UK Biobank <lb/>samples (~2% of the full UK Biobank sample set; Supplementary Information) and a GRM constructed <lb/>using: imputed SNPs with imputation info score &gt; 0.8; MAF &gt; 1%; Hardy Weinberg P-value &gt; 1 x 10 -8 ; <lb/>genotype missingness &lt; 1%, after converting imputed dosages to best-guess genotypes; LD pruned at a <lb/>threshold (r 2 ) of 0.2; and excluding the major histocompatibility complex, the lactase locus, and the <lb/>inversions on chromosomes 8 and 17 (Supplementary Information). <lb/>Association testing <lb/>For genome-wide association testing, we used BOLT-LMM to run a linear mixed model (LMM). We tested <lb/>SNPs with imputation quality (info) &gt; 0.3, minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.01%, and only those single-<lb/>nucleotide variants (SNVs) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represented in the Haplotype <lb/>Reference Consortium 25 imputation reference panel. We used only the standard LMM implementation <lb/>(i.e., infinitesimal model, using --lmm) in BOLT-LMM (Supplementary Fig 12-13); we did not run <lb/>association testing using a non-infinitesimal model. The only covariate used in the LMM was the SNP array <lb/>used to genotype sample; we included no other covariates. <lb/>After association testing, we looked at known SNPs already reported in WHR, WHRadjBMI, and BMI. 5,23 At <lb/>the previously-described loci, we checked correlation of frequency, beta, standard error, and -log10(P-<lb/>value) between our UK Biobank GWAS and the previous GWAS results (Supplementary Fig 14). <lb/>Additionally, we estimated genomic inflation (lambda) and the LD Score Intercept to check if the P-<lb/>values were well calibrated (Supplementary Table 2); calculations were performed using the LD Score <lb/>software (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). 12 <lb/>Meta-analysis of results from UK Biobank and GIANT <lb/>Data preparation and quality control <lb/>We downloaded summary-level results from previous meta-analyses of WHR and WHRadjBMI <lb/>(https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files <lb/>and <lb/>Supplementary Information) performed by the GIANT consortium. 5 Marker names in both the GIANT data <lb/>and UK Biobank were lifted over to their dbSNP151 identifier. We additionally renamed markers as <lb/>&quot;rsID:A1:A2&quot; to avoid ambiguity at multiallelic SNPs in the UK Biobank data. As the GIANT data was <lb/>imputed with HapMap 2 25,26 data (hg18), we additionally lifted chromosomal positions to hg19 for this <lb/>data. SNPs with a frequency difference &gt; 15% between GIANT and UK Biobank were removed from the <lb/>data (Supplementary Fig 15). <lb/>Meta-analysis and downstream quality control <lb/>We performed inverse variance-weighted fixed effects meta-analysis in METAL. 28 To estimate LD score <lb/>intercepts and genomic inflation (lambda) for the meta-analysis results, we first estimated LD scores <lb/>from the same samples used to estimate the LD score reference for BOLT-LMM. LD scores were only <lb/>estimated at high-quality SNPs (using the same criteria as used for SNPs included in the GRM in BOLT-<lb/>LMM, but without applying a MAF threshold; Supplementary Information). We then calculated LD Score <lb/>Regression intercepts and lambda with the LDSC software. 12 <lb/>As an additional quality control check, we reran all of our GWAS using two different subsets of the UK <lb/>Biobank samples: (1) the unrelated samples only, and (2) the unrelated white British samples only. These <lb/>subsamples were selected to test if our initial UK Biobank-wide GWAS was confounded by either <lb/>relatedness or ancestral heterogeneity. After running these GWAS, we meta-analyzed the results with <lb/>the existing GIANT summary-level data, and checked the concordance of our signals (Supplementary Fig <lb/>2-3). <lb/>Identification of index and secondary signals <lb/>Linkage disequilibrium clumping <lb/>To identify genomic loci (i.e., genomic windows) containing independent association signals, we first <lb/>constructed a reference dataset of best-guess genotypes from 20,275 unrelated UK Biobank samples <lb/>(equivalent to 5% of the unrelated sample). We converted imputed dosages of SNPs with info score &gt; 0.3 <lb/>and MAF &gt; 0.001% to best-guess genotypes using PLINK (version 1.9), 29,30 and a conversion threshold (--<lb/>hard-call-threshold) of 0.1 (Supplementary Information). SNPs with missingness &gt; 5% after conversion <lb/>or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p &lt; 1 x 10 -7 were removed. <lb/>We then used the PLINK &apos;clumping&apos; algorithm to select top-associated SNPs (p &lt; 5 x 10 -9 ) and identify all <lb/>SNPs in LD (r 2 &gt; 0.05) with the top associated SNP and ±5Mb away. We determined the genomic span of <lb/>each LD-based clump and added 1kb up-and downstream as buffer to the region. If any of these windows <lb/>overlapped, we merged them together into a single (larger) locus. As a sensitivity analysis, we ran <lb/>clumping also using a smaller genomic window to calculate LD (±2Mb); the results were effectively <lb/>unchanged, as &lt;5 loci appeared independent using the ±2Mb window but were found to correlate using <lb/>±5Mb windows. Therefore we report loci using the ±5Mb window. <lb/>Proximal conditional and joint testing <lb/>To identify index and secondary signals within each of the clumping-based loci, we ran proximal joint <lb/>and conditional analysis as implemented in the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software 30 . <lb/>We ran this model (--cojo-slct) using the summary-level data within each locus, the LD reference panel <lb/>constructed from UK Biobank data and also used for the locus &apos;clumping,&apos; and setting genome-wide <lb/>significance with p &lt; 5 x 10 -9 . <lb/>Collider bias analysis <lb/>Given that we had conditioned WHR on the BMI phenotype for analysis (and BMI and WHR are correlated; <lb/>r = 0.433 in the UK Biobank data; Supplementary Fig 16 ), we tested all index signals found in the <lb/>WHRadjBMI analysis for evidence of collider bias. 15,31 To do this, we ran meta-analyses of BMI and WHR <lb/>using the UK Biobank samples and pre-existing summary-level data from GIANT 5,23 (Supplementary <lb/>Methods). We performed these meta-analyses using identical methods to the meta-analysis of <lb/>WHRadjBMI. <lb/>Then, for each index SNP from the WHRadjBMI meta-analyses (combined as well as sex-specific) we <lb/>extracted the association results from the BMI and WHR meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig 4). <lb/>WHRadjBMI-associated SNPs with a stronger association for BMI than WHR show evidence of collider bias <lb/>or pleiotropy. We additionally looked at the effect size and direction of effect in BMI and WHR, but <lb/>whether the effects are from collider bias or pleiotropy cannot be determined from this data. <lb/>Identification of sex-dimorphic signals <lb/>We performed sex-specific GWAS in UK Biobank and meta-analyzed the results with publicly-available <lb/>sex-specific data from the GIANT consortium. We identified the primary and secondary signals from these <lb/>meta-analyses using methods identical to those performed in the combined analysis. We tested each <lb/>primary and secondary signal for a sex-dimorphic effect by estimating the t-statistic: <lb/>𝑡 = <lb/> 𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 −  𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 <lb/>√𝑆𝐸𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 + 𝑆𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 + (2𝑟 × 𝑆𝐸 𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 × 𝑆𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 ) <lb/>(1) <lb/>where r is the genome-wide correlation between SNP effects in females and males. We estimated the t-<lb/>statistic and the resulting so-called pdiff 16 (P-value from a t-distribution with one degree of freedom) as <lb/>implemented in the EasyStrata software. 32 We tested a total of 2,162 different index SNPs for sex-<lb/>dimorphism; we tested all of the secondary signals as well, but these signals are by definition in linkage <lb/>disequilibrium with the index SNPs (and therefore not independent). Given that we tested for sex-<lb/>dimorphism at index SNPs in not only WHRadjBMI but WHR and BMI as well, we performed a test at 1,502 <lb/>distinct genomic loci. Therefore, we set significance for sex-dimorphism at a Bonferroni-corrected p = <lb/>0.05/1,502 = 3.3 x 10 -5 . <lb/>SNPs were determined to have a stronger effect in women if they fell into one of the following categories <lb/>(abs: absolute value): <lb/>(a) betafemales ≤ 0 and betamales ≤ 0 and abs(betafemales) &gt; abs(betamales) <lb/>(b) betafemales ≥ 0 and betamales ≥ 0 and abs(betafemales) &gt; abs(betamales) <lb/>(c) betafemales ≤ 0 and betamales ≥ 0 and pfemales &lt; pmales and abs(betafemales) &gt; abs(betamales), or <lb/>(d) betafemales ≥ 0 and betamales ≤ 0 and pfemales &lt; pmales and abs(betafemales) &gt; abs(betamales) <lb/>Heritability calculations <lb/>SNP-based heritability calculations <lb/>We implemented all heritability calculations in BOLT-LMM. 10 We used the same genetic relationship <lb/>matrix (GRM) to estimate SNP-based heritability as we did to run our GWAS (see Genome-wide association <lb/>analyses). This GRM included 790,000 SNPs. Heritability was estimated using only the UK Biobank <lb/>samples, for which we had individual level data; these estimates are likely more accurate than those <lb/>resulting from only summary-level data. We used Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation, <lb/>implemented as --reml in BOLT. <lb/>To test the impact of including lower-frequency SNPs in the heritability estimates, we constructed an <lb/>additional GRM identically as we had for association testing, but including no minor allele frequency <lb/>threshold. This GRM included ~1.7M SNPs. Heritability analyses were calculated identically using this GRM <lb/>and --reml in BOLT. <lb/>To calculate whether heritability estimates in men and women were sex-dimorphic, we used the <lb/>following equation to generate a z-score: <lb/></div>

We extracted the index SNPs <lb/>from the HRC imputed genotypes. To generate the WHRadjBMI variable, we regressed WHR on BMI, age, <lb/>age-squared, sex and principal components 1-5. We then performed rank based inverse normalization on <lb/>the resulting residuals. We validated the findings in 3 steps: <lb/>(1) Directional consistency. We checked for directional consistency between the effect of index SNPs on <lb/>WHRadjBMI from the main meta-analysis and EXTEND. We performed linear regression of WHRadjBMI on <lb/>each individual SNP. We ensured all alleles were aligned to the WHRadjBMI increasing allele in the original <lb/>meta-analysis. We compared directions between all 346 index SNPs and then split these into novel and <lb/>known signals to determine the number of novel signals showing consistent directionality. <lb/>(2) Variance explained. We evaluated the proportion of variance explained by including all the index <lb/>SNPs into a linear regression model and calculated the adjusted R 2 . We performed these analyses using <lb/>the lm() function in R. <lb/>(3) Polygenic scores. We created a weighted polygenic score based on the 346 index SNPs associated with <lb/>WHRadjBMI. The weighted polygenic score was calculated by summing the dosage of the WHRadjBMI-<lb/>increasing alleles (weighted by the effect size on WHRadjBMI from the meta-analysis). We then <lb/>performed linear regression to test the association between WHRadjBMI and the GRS in our independent <lb/>dataset. <lb/>To determine how likely 5% of individuals carrying the most number of WHRadjBMI increasing alleles were <lb/>to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) WHR threshold for metabolic syndrome 13 comparing to 5% <lb/>carrying the least, we used the WHR reference levels of &gt; 0.9 in men and &gt; 0.85 in women to define <lb/>cases and WHR &lt; 0.9 in men and &lt; 0.85 in women to define controls. We excluded all individuals with <lb/>missing data leaving a sample size of 7,513. We took 5% of individuals (7,513 x 0.05 = 376) from the two <lb/>ends of weighted GRS and coded them as 1 or 2 respectively. We tested for the likelihood of the top 5% <lb/>meeting the WHR threshold for metabolic syndrome (WHO criteria) compared to the bottom 5% using a <lb/>binomial logistic regression model adjusting for age, age-squared, sex and principal components 1-5. <lb/>Comparison of WHRadjBMI-associated SNPs in other fat distribution phenotypes <lb/>Comparison with body fat percentage <lb/>Similarly to Shungin et al 5 , we carried out analysis on the 346 index SNPs and their association with BF%. <lb/>We obtained association statistics for the 346 SNPs with BF% from a GWAS of 443,001 unrelated, <lb/>European-ancestry UK Biobank individuals. We aligned all results to the WHRadjBMI increasing allele and <lb/>used a Bonferroni-corrected P-value (0.05/346 = 1..44 X 10 -4 ) to determine if a SNP was also associated <lb/>with BF%. To determine whether sex-specific WHRadjBMI index SNPs have an adiposity phenotype, we <lb/>took the 97 (female-specific) and 8 (male-specific) SNPs and independently compared their effects on <lb/>WHR and BF% in men and women. To identify which sex-dimorphic SNPs were strongly associated with <lb/>BF% in men and women separately, we used a Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 0.05/105 (4.8 x 10 -4 ) <lb/>(Supplementary Fig 8 and Supplementary Table 9). We obtained Pearson&apos;s r correlations using the cor() <lb/>function in R for each comparison. <lb/>Comparison with genome-wide analysis of depot-specific traits <lb/>Recently, Chu et al 20 performed a genome-wide association study of subcutaneous and ectopic fat depots, <lb/>as measured by CT and MRI imaging, in a multi-ancestry sample. Since the meta-analysis results are <lb/>publicly-available (https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov/FullResults.aspx and Supplementary Information for <lb/>further details), we took the index SNPs from our WHRadjBMI meta-analyses (combined sample as well <lb/>as sex-specific), checked for allele consistency, aligned effects to the reference allele, and tested for <lb/>associations with the imaging based measures of subcutaneous and ectopic fat. We repeated these <lb/>analyses in men and women separately. The depots investigated in the imaging-based GWAS were: <lb/>pericardial tissue (PAT), PAT adjusted for height and weight (PATadjHtWt), subcutaneous adipose tissue <lb/>(SAT) ,SAT Hounsfield units as measured by MRI (SATHU), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), VAT Hounsfield <lb/>units (VATHU), ratio of VAT to SAT (VAT/SAT), and VAT adjusted for BMI (VATadjBMI). <lb/>We calculated Pearson&apos;s r correlations between z-scores in WHRadjBMI (calculated by dividing the SNP <lb/>beta by the standard error) and SNP z-scores reported in Chu et al. 20 We evaluated significance of the <lb/>correlation by performing a t-test (implemented as cor.test() in R). Correlations were considered <lb/>significant if P-value &lt; 0.05/3 sample groups/9 phenotypes = 1.9 x 10 -3 . <lb/></div>
