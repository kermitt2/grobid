			<body> 1 INTRODUCTION <lb/> Fishways are hydraulic structures that enable fish to overcome obstructions in the passage to the <lb/>spawning and other upstream migrations and are built when they are required for ecological, <lb/>economical or legal considerations. The vertical slot fishway is the commonly used fish ladders <lb/>because it allows variations in discharge and water levels [1]. It consists of a rectangular channel <lb/>with a sloping floor which is divided into a number of pools. Water runs downstream in this channel <lb/>through a series of vertical slots from one pool to the next one below. The water flow forms a jet as it <lb/>goes through the slot and the energy is dissipated by jet mixing in the pool [2]. The baffles are so <lb/>shaped that part of the flow is turned back upstream to create recirculation regions in the pools where <lb/>the fish would rest to recover their swimming ability before ascending the fishway through the slots <lb/>at any depth it chooses. The flow patterns are very important in order to guide the fish and make <lb/>possible its way along the structure. <lb/>Several vertical slot fishways have been built in France over the last twenty years as part of the <lb/>plan to restore or enhance migratory fish stocks. This may be considered to the best type of pool fish <lb/>pass and is usually very effective in ensuring unhindered passage of the target species (generally <lb/>salmon, sea trout, shad, marine lamprey...) as well as several riverine species such as trout, grayling, <lb/>barbel, bream....However observations have shown that some small species seem to have difficulty <lb/>in rapidly passing through very large pools. The recent European Water Framework Directive <lb/>

			confirmed the importance of ecological continuity in rivers, not only for migratory species, but also <lb/>for all fish species, including small species and more generally river fauna. <lb/>This experimental study was thus undertaken to characterize the turbulent flow for various <lb/>configurations of vertical slot fishways and to determine how their characteristics may be modified <lb/>in order to facilitate passage of the small species. The characteristics of mean flow and turbulence <lb/>were studied by PIV for several different slopes, flow discharges and pool widths. In order to study <lb/>the extent to which the dimensions of recirculation zones can be reduced, the effect of the insertion <lb/>of vertical cylinders within the pools was visualized by laser tomography. <lb/> 2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE <lb/> The experimental work was undertaken in the Laboratoire d&apos;Etudes Aérodynamiques (LEA) of <lb/>the University of Poitiers (France) on a physical model, related to the prototype by the Froudian <lb/>similitude, of geometrical scale 1/4. The velocity scale is 1/2 and the discharge scale is 1/32. The <lb/>width of the slot is b = 0.075 m. The vertical slot fishway model consists of five pools, L/b = 10 long <lb/>and H/b = 7.33 deep. The width of each pool could be set to four values: B/b = 9, 7.66, 6.66 and <lb/>5.66. The channel slope could take three values: I = 5, 10 and 15 %. The crosswalls between pools <lb/>are perfectly vertical for a channel slope I = 10 %. Three flow discharges are studied: Q = 18, 23 and <lb/>27 L/s. The discharge velocities in the slot are respectively V d  = 0.72, 0.94 and 1.09 m/s for the three <lb/>channel slope I = 5, 10 and 15 %. The equivalent Reynolds numbers, calculated with the slot width b <lb/> and the discharge velocities in the slot V d  , are respectively R e  = 60600, 79100 and 91800 according <lb/>to the slope. The experimental measurements were taken in the third pool in order to ensure an <lb/>established symmetrical flow. The X-axis is in the longitudinal direction and the Y-axis is in the <lb/>transverse direction of the fishway. The XY plane is parallel with the channel bed. All the geometric <lb/>dimensions are divided by the slot width b and the velocities are normalized by the discharge <lb/>velocities in the slot V d  . <lb/> Fig. 1 -Pool configuration and example of vertical slot fishway <lb/> Velocity measurements were taken by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in two <lb/>planes parallel with the channel bed of the fishway (Z/b = 0.26 and 2) and in the vertical plane (Y/b = <lb/>1.82) passing by the slots. The acquisition and treatment PIV system is composed of a laser lighting <lb/>a flow section, a camera system and a synchronization unit. The correlator Flowmap PIV 2000 <lb/>

			Processor (Dantec) allows to synchronize the laser system and the cameras. A laser Nd-Yag double <lb/>cavity Spectra-Physics (2x200 mJ) has been used to highlight a flow section seeded by particles 11 <lb/> 񮽙m diameter. The frequency of each cavity is approximately 10 Hz and the wavelength is 532 nm. <lb/>The beams coming from the two cavities are then conveyed, through a telescopic arm towards a <lb/>system of double lens system making it possible to produce a narrow laser sheet which have a <lb/>thickness of about 1.5 mm. In order to record the successive images of the flow, two cameras <lb/>FlowIntense are used with objectives of 28 mm and placed in parallel to visualize the whole pool. <lb/>The resolution of these cameras is 1376x1040 pixels², coded on 12 bits. The cameras make it <lb/>possible to acquire two successive images of the flow separated by a very short time 񮽙t (between <lb/>3000 and 4000 񮽙s) which is generated between the two cavities of the laser. By means of a PC, the <lb/>FlowManager software (Dantec) controls PIV system (i.e. to regulate the specific parameters to each <lb/>measurement) and computes cross-correlation between the successive images and postprocessing on <lb/>the calculated data. An initial interrogation area of 64x64 pixels², a final interrogation area of 32x32 <lb/>pixels² with an overlap of 50 % and window deformation are used to compute the cross-correlation. <lb/>For each camera, five bursts of 175 image acquisitions (separated by T = 200 ms) allow to obtain <lb/>875 instantaneous velocity fields which are then averaged. The two mean velocity fields calculated <lb/>are combinated in order to have the complete mean velocity field of the pool. <lb/>Visualizations completed the study of the flow and were achieved by laser tomography (with a <lb/>laser optic fibre) and recorded with a camera Panasonic NV-MX300EG (resolution:1568x1152 <lb/>pixels², dynamic: 12 bits) at several depths within a pool, with and without cylinder. <lb/> 3 RESULTS <lb/>3.1 Turbulent flow in vertical slot fishways <lb/> Fig. 2 shows the streamlines and velocities in the plane Z/b = 2 for four configurations of vertical <lb/>slot fishways (slope I = 10 % and width B/b = 9, 7.66, 6.66 and 5.66) for a flow discharge Q = 23 <lb/>L/s. For all the configurations, the flow in a pool is mainly composed of three important areas [6]: a <lb/>principal jet caused by the slot, passing through the pool with decreasing velocity and two large <lb/>recirculation zones generated on each side of this principal flow. The recirculations around an axis <lb/>perpendicular to the channel bed allow for dissipation of the jet energy in each pool [5]. Swirling <lb/>cells of variable sizes, created by the principal recirculations, occur in all the corners of the pool, due <lb/>to the velocity differential between the recirculating flow and the zero velocities on the wall. Two <lb/>different flow patterns occur according to the ratio length/width of the pool. <lb/> Fig. 2 -Streamlines and velocity in a vertical slot fishway: I = 10 %, B = 9, 7.66, 6.66 and 5.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 2 <lb/>

			The first flow pattern is for the largest width (B/b = 9). The principal flow leaving the slot <lb/>enters the pool as a curved jet which opens out before converging towards the following slot. The jet <lb/>creates on a side, between the large baffles, an important recirculation area occupying roughly half of <lb/>the pool surface. On the other side of the principal flow, a swirling zone of smaller size, rotating in <lb/>the opposite sense to the preceding one, is generated between the small wall deflectors. The highest <lb/>velocities are found in the jet, at a maximum when leaving the slot and decreasing progressively as <lb/>the flow enters the pool while the lowest values are found in the recirculation areas (Fig. 3). The <lb/>great difference between the velocities of the principal flow and those of the recirculation areas <lb/>creates a high shear layer at the jet boundaries near the slot. <lb/> Fig. 3 -Flow visualizations in a vertical slot fishway: I = 10 %, B/b = 9, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/>Fig. 4 -Flow visualizations in a vertical slot fishway: I = 10 %, B/b = 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/> A second flow pattern occurs for the pools of low width (B/b = 6.66 and 5.66): the jet has a very <lb/>curved form and directly hits the opposite side wall (Fig. 2 and 4). Two large contra-rotating swirls <lb/>are then generated in the corner upstream of the pool and in the convex part of the jet and a smaller <lb/>one occurs close to the large baffle. The reduction in width of the pool changes the dimensions and <lb/>the shapes of the swirling cells: the area of principal recirculation occurring for the first flow pattern <lb/>is divided into two small swirls. The first is moved towards the upstream corner of the pool with a <lb/>reduction in its surface area compared to the first pattern and the second is pushed back along the <lb/>

			large deflector. On the other side of the flow, the vortex tends to occupy the open space left in the <lb/>convex part of the curved jet. It contracts in the longitudinal direction and is stretched in the <lb/>transverse direction. Its size relative to the pool surface area increases. The velocities are high in the <lb/>principal flow, at a maximum in the slot, while the values are low in the centre of the large swirls, <lb/>creating zones of strong velocity gradients on the edges of the jet (Fig. 4). <lb/>For all the fishway configurations studied, the slope variation does not generate different flow <lb/>patterns: the two large countra-rotating cells are found on each side of the principal jet. Thus when <lb/>the slope increases, the jet widens slightly whereas the sizes of the recirculation zones are reduced <lb/>slightly. <lb/> Fig. 5 -Streamlines and velocity in a vertical slot fishway: I = 5, 10 and 15 %, B/b = 7.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 2 <lb/> For an intermediate pool width (B/b = 7.66), the flow topology varies according to the channel <lb/>slope [7]. For the lower slopes (I = 5 and 10 %) the flow pattern looks like that observed for a pool <lb/>of width B/b = 9: two great recirculation areas, one on each side of a jet, including one composed of <lb/>two swirls separated by a singular point (Fig. 5). Whereas for the higher slope (I = 15 %) the flow <lb/>pattern is similar to the topology obtained for widths B/b = 6.66 and 5.66 namely a curved jet, a <lb/>considerable recirculation occupying the convex part of the principal flow, a swirl in the upstream <lb/>corner and another along the large deflector. <lb/>For all pool widths tested and the two principal flow models, the velocities values undergo <lb/>strong variations when the slope changed (Fig. 5). These values grow with the slope and are very <lb/>more important for a slope of I = 15 % as compared to a slope of I = 5 %. The velocity gradients at <lb/>the jet boundaries, mainly close to the slots, also increase with the slope. <lb/>

			Fig. 6 -Streamlines and velocity in a vertical slot fishway: I = 10 %, B/b = 9, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/> The flow topology is independent of the height of the measurement section [3] within the pool <lb/>(Fig. 2 and 6). There are few variations of the recirculation shape and the location of their centres <lb/>whatever the height, while velocities remain on the whole identical in the pool from the channel bed <lb/>to the free surface. Except in the slot zone (Fig. 7), the vertical component of the velocity is less <lb/>significant than the longitudinal and transverse velocities and the flow structure can thus generally be <lb/>considered to be two-dimensional in the pool [4]. <lb/> Fig. 7 -Streamlines in a vertical slot fishway: I = 10 %, B/b = 9 and 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Y/b = 1.82 <lb/> The discharge parameter has very little influence on the flow in vertical slot fishways. The flow <lb/>topology as well as velocities remain similar for the three discharges. The main consequence of a <lb/>flow increase is a rise in the water height, controlled by the slots, without velocity variation. <lb/> 3.2 Flow control <lb/> Visual observations made in large vertical slot fish passes showed that certain small species can <lb/>remain trapped a very long time in the large reciculation zones in the pools. All these areas, which in <lb/>principle are designed to be resting areas, become in fact so many traps for small fish. The drastic <lb/>increase of transit times in each pool can compromise the efficiency of the fish pass, particularly in <lb/>the case of a facility composed of numerous pools. Such examples of disorientation of fish have been <lb/>observed when the size of eddies becomes too large compared to that of the fish, then the fish will <lb/>tend to orient themselves in relation to local components of the velocity and to bump into baffles. <lb/>The disorientated fish seems to have difficulty in penetrating through the jet and rapidly finding the <lb/>

			exit slot. This may have reduce the efficiency of the facility [1]. A first solution for small species, <lb/>would consist in reducing both the drop between pools and the dimensions of the pools, so as to <lb/>reduce the maximum velocities, the turbulence and the size of recirculation areas. On existing <lb/>facilities, the most realistic and economical solution is to adapt the internal flow in the pools. <lb/>Considering that it is not easy to reduce the drop between pools, the only way is to reduce the sizes <lb/>of recirculating areas and to attenuate the obstacle of the strong shear layers at the jet boundaries. <lb/>First tests were carried out by inserting obstacles (of dimension equal to the slot width b) within <lb/>the pools in order to break the large swirling structures. In order to check the effectiveness of such <lb/>configuration on the shear layers and recirculation zones, flow visualizations were thus made for two <lb/>geometric configurations (slope I = 10 % and width B/b = 9 and 6.66 for a discharge Q = 23 L/s) <lb/>which represent the two flow models. <lb/>An obstacle of diameter equal to the slot width b, judiciously placed in the pool, modifies the <lb/>flow topology. The obstacle must be insert in the jet near the slot. Indeed, the jet resulting from the <lb/>slot widens in the pool before converging towards the following slot. For an obstacle located in the <lb/>jet in the middle of the pool, the principal flow, of width higher than the geometry diameter, turns <lb/>around the obstacle on each side. However the weak deviation does not make it possible to break or <lb/>reduce notably the recirculations. The shear layers which are more intense at the slot exit are not <lb/>affected by the obstacle. The insertion of obstacles within the recirculations does not modify the <lb/>velocity gradients nor flow topology because the flow recirculates around the geometries which do <lb/>not influence the jet and the swirls. It is thus necessary to establish the obstacles at the slot exit. In <lb/>this zone, the jet has a minimal width of the same order as the slot. An obstacle of size identical to <lb/>the jet has more effect on the flow in order to break or reduce the structures and to attenuate the <lb/>velocity gradients at the jet boundaries. <lb/> Fig. 8 -Flow visualizations in a fishway with a half-cylinder (plane face directed towards the flow): I = 10 %, B/b = 9 <lb/>and 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/> The insertion in the jet of a half-cylinder, whose plane face is directed towards the flow, <lb/>changes basically the topology. The jet impacts the plane face of the half-cylinder and turns around it <lb/>on the two sides with an important separation due to the presence of arrises (Fig. 8). For the two <lb/>

			configurations, the same flow topology exists when the obstacle is placed at the slot exit. A part of <lb/>the jet impacting the plane face of the half-cylinder is directly conveyed along the small deflectors <lb/>towards the following slot, creating a recirculation behind the small baffle. The other part of the jet is <lb/>directed towards the opposite wall between the large deflectors and then joined the direct flow in the <lb/>slot entry. The recirculating flows which exist in the case of pools without obstacles are removed but <lb/>an important recirculation zone is created downstream from the obstacle between the two principal <lb/>flows resulting from the slot and getting around the half-cylinder. The fluid separation on the edges <lb/>of the half-cylinder generates intense shear zones which amplify the problem of the velocity <lb/>gradients at the jet boundaries when the fish penetrates the jet. This solution of breakable structure is <lb/>not satisfactory since the number and the site of the recirculations are modified but a more important <lb/>recirculation is created in the central part of the pool, which increases the trap risk and disorientation <lb/>for fish. <lb/> Fig. 9 -Flow visualizations in a fishway with a cylinder: I = 10 %, B/b = 9 and 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/> The insertion of cylinder was thus tested in order to modify the flow without changing it <lb/>radically. The presence of a cylinder in the jet at the slot exit makes it possible to obtain some <lb/>aspects of a half-cylinder while mitigating its effects. The flow resulting from the slot turns around <lb/>the cylinder on the two sides of the obstacle by generating a less important separation due to the <lb/>absence of arrises on the obstacle. Nevertheless separation is sufficient to widen the jet significantly <lb/>what reduces by the same occasion the two contrarotating cells located on both sides (Fig. 9). For the <lb/>two configurations, a recirculation is generated downstream from the cylinder between the two <lb/>principal flows resulting from the slot. The two direct flows reattach behind the cylinder. The <lb/>dimension of the recirculation and the localization of the reattachment point depend on the <lb/>configuration and the site of the cylinder. The more the cylinder is placed close to the slot, the more <lb/>the two principal flows are diverted far from the cylinder near the walls with very curved <lb/>trajectories. In this case the reattachment point takes place far downstream from the cylinder and the <lb/>recirculation behind the cylinder is more important. On the contrary when the cylinder is far from the <lb/>slot, the principal flows are less curved, the recirculation is smaller and the reattachment point is <lb/>closer to the cylinder. The absence of arrises decreases the intensity of the velocity gradients and <lb/>makes it possible to have shear layers that the fish could penetrate. An acceptable compromise <lb/>between the recirculation dimension downstream from the cylinder, the fish passage in the slot and <lb/>

			the reduction of the two principal swirls makes it possible to place the cylinder approximately at X/b <lb/> = 2.1 and Y/b = 3.1 (variable according to the configuration). Such a location of the cylinder <lb/>influences significantly the flow topology (deviation of the jet, shear layer, reduction of the <lb/>recirculations) while allowing the passage of the large fishes. <lb/>The test with a half-cylinder whose round face is placed in the flow direction does not improve <lb/>the flow topology for the fish because the profit obtained on the reduction of the principal swirls on <lb/>both sides of the jet is compensated by the separation on the arrises which increases the recirculation <lb/>behind the obstacle (Fig. 10). <lb/> Fig. 10 -Flow visualizations in a fishway with a half-cylinder (round face directed towards the flow): I = 10 %, B/b = 9 <lb/>and 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/>Fig. 11 -Flow visualizations in a fishway with 2 cylinders: I = 10 %, B/b = 9 and 6.66, Q = 23 L/s at Z/b = 0.26 <lb/> A last configuration with two cylinders was tested for the two configurations (Fig. 11). The first <lb/>is placed at the slot exit in order to widen the jet and to reduce the two contrarotating cells on both <lb/>sides. The second cylinder is placed downstream from the first, slightly shifted in the pool according <lb/>to the configuration, in order to break the direct flow resulting from the deviation of the first <lb/>

			cylinder. This configuration makes it possible to reduce the recirculation located between the small <lb/>deflectors. But this reciculation becomes more intense and the rotation rate is stronger than for the <lb/>configuration with only one cylinder. The second cylinder creates downstream a small swirling zone <lb/>which could be an additional rest area for fish. <lb/>Finally two solutions were obtained to optimize the flow pattern and to facilitate the fish <lb/>passage. The insertion of a vertical cylinder at the slot exit allows to reduce the recirculations <lb/>dimensions and to attenuate the shear layers at the jet boundaries. It provides rest area for fish when <lb/>they ascend the fishway. The insertion of a second cylinder reduces the swirl located near the small <lb/>baffle which becomes more intense. <lb/> CONCLUSION <lb/> The flow for various configurations of vertical slot fishways was finally limited to two principal <lb/>topology models according to the ratio length/width of the pool. The first which occurred for L/B = <lb/>10/9 was composed of two great recirculation areas located on each side of the jet leaving the slot. <lb/>The second occurred when the ratio L/B was lower than 3/2. The large recirculation area was then <lb/>divided by the jet hitting the side wall, into two swirling cells one of which was located at the <lb/>upstream corner of the pool and the other along the large baffle. A third swirl then occupied the <lb/>convex part of the jet. Depending on the channel slope, the intermediate pool widths generated one <lb/>or other of the models. For these two topologies, the flow within the pool was rather two-<lb/>dimensional so the fish, which swim up the vertical slot, encounter the same characteristics at any <lb/>depth of the flow from the bottom to the water surface. Moreover a discharge variation caused a <lb/>variation of the water depth in the fishway without modifying the flow patterns. Velocities increased <lb/>with the channel slope. The insertion of vertical obstacles judiciuously placed at the slot exit allows <lb/>to reduce the recirculations and to attenuate the shear layers at the jet boundaries. The velocities in <lb/>the principal flow are within the swim capacities of the small fish and the swirl created downstream <lb/>from the cylinders provides rest area. <lb/> </body>
