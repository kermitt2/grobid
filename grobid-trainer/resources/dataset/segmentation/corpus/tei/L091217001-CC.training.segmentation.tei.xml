			<body>I. Introduction <lb/>The cobalt oxide superconductor Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O [1] has characteristic features in <lb/>its structure and Co valence state[2]. The structure is composed of thick insulating layers <lb/>of Na atoms and H 2 O molecules, as well as conducting CoO layers. In the CoO layer, <lb/>CoO 6 octahedra are connected to each other by edge sharing with the Co sites forming a <lb/>triangular lattice. On the other hand, the valence of the Co ion is between 3+ (3d ) and 4+ <lb/>(3d 5 ) as in the case of Na 0.5 CoO 2 [3]. Co 3+ and Co 4+ ions often have low spin states with <lb/>S=0 and 1/2, respectively. At the early stage of research, this compound was considered <lb/>as a system of S=1/2 triangular lattice doped with electrons and the doped resonating-<lb/>valence-bond (RVB) model[4] was expected to be valid for explaining its superconductivity. <lb/>Now, it is widely recognized that the electron density of this compound is so large that the <lb/>doped RVB model can not be applied simply. Most of studies reported thus far suggest <lb/>strongly that the superconductivity of this compound is unconventional. <lb/>The symmetry of superconducting gap function is one of the most important param-<lb/>eters to elucidate the mechanism of superconductivity, and our understanding of super-<lb/>conductivity has become deeper with finding of various types of superconductivity with <lb/>different symmetries. Thus, many researchers have been greatly interested in the super-<lb/>conducting symmetry of Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O since its discovery. <lb/>Theoretically, various possibilities have been proposed on the superconducting sym-<lb/>metry of the compound (or more generally, for the triangular lattice system), for example, <lb/></body>

			<body>d-, chiral d-, chiral p-, and f -waves[5]. These states can be distinguished from each other <lb/>by microscopic experiments such as nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), muon spin ro-<lb/>tation/relaxation (µSR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the NQR measure-<lb/>ments, no Hebel-Schlichter peak (coherence peak) was observed in a 1/ 59 T 1 T -T curve (T 1 : <lb/>relaxation time, and T : temperature)[6, 7], which means that the superconducting gap <lb/>has nodes on the Fermi surface. Thus, the symmetry of s-, chiral d-, and chiral p-waves <lb/>are denied. It was pointed out previously for the case of chiral d-or chiral p-wave that if <lb/>superconductivity is disturbed by impurities, the coherence peak is reduced and may not <lb/>be observed[8]. However, an internal magnetic field should exist if chiral d or chiral p is the <lb/>case, and it has never observed by µSR[9]. These results are consistent with specific heat <lb/>data, which suggest the presence of line-nodes[10] in the superconducting gap. Therefore, <lb/>the superconducting symmetry is limited to d-or f -wave. The d-and f -wave symmetries <lb/>can be distinguished from T -dependence of Knight shift, K; sudden change of K below <lb/>T c is expected for spin singlet Cooper pairs with the d-wave symmetry, while invariable <lb/>K below T c along a certain direction for spin triplet pairing with the f -wave symmetry. <lb/>Unfortunately, inconsistent results have been reported thus far on K [11, 12]. The NMR <lb/>measurement usually needs an external magnetic field, and the magnetic field makes it <lb/>difficult to obtain the real (intrinsic) Knight shift, that is, K may apparently change below <lb/>T c caused by demagnetization effect resulting from the superconducting diamagnetism, or <lb/>on the contrary, K may be apparently invariant if the applied magnetic field is close to or <lb/>higher than the upper-critical field, H c2 . Thus, the estimation of H c2 is quite important <lb/>to interpret the NMR data. <lb/>Recently, many H c2 data have been reported. According to magnetic measurements, <lb/>we obtained an extremely high initial slope of dH c2 /dT c | H=0 = 19.3 T/K, by which H c2 <lb/>was calculated to be approximately 60 T if Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model <lb/>is applied[13]. This value of the initial slope is close to that estimated from the specific heat <lb/>data[10]. However, by transport measurements, much smaller H c2 has been obtained even <lb/>for the case that the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to c-axis[14]. In the present <lb/>study, we prepared samples carefully and elucidated influence of synthesis conditions on <lb/>the superconducting properties including H c2 . <lb/>II. Experimental <lb/>The powder samples of Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O were synthesized from Na 0.7 CoO 2 essen-<lb/>tially in the same way as reported in the previous paper[1]. Synthesis of the precur-<lb/>sor of Na 0.7 CoO 2 was described elsewhere[15]. The duration times of the immersion in <lb/>Br 2 /CH 3 CN and water were both 5 days. Volume of water, V w , was varied to find an op-<lb/>timum condition; each sample of Na x CoO 2 (x ∼ 0.4)[2], which was made from Na 0.7 CoO 2 <lb/>with the mass of 1 g, was immersed in water with V w = 10, 50, 100, 300, 500, or 1000 ml. <lb/>The samples were filtered and stored in atmosphere of relative humidity of 70%. The sam-<lb/>ples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductive-coupled plasma <lb/>atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). XRD measurements were carried out using a <lb/>Bragg-Brentano-type diffractometer (RINT2200HF, Rigaku) with Cu K α radiation. ICP-<lb/></body>

The magnetization, M , of the sample was measured using a com-<lb/>mercial magnetometer with a superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS-XL, <lb/>Quantum Design). Before each measurement under zero-field cooling (ZFC) condition, the <lb/>magnetic field, H, was reset to 0 Oe at T = 10 K or 300 K. <lb/>III. Results and Discussion <lb/>The XRD patterns of all the samples, which were measured just day after the <lb/>filtration, are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in the figure, all the samples immersed in water <lb/>with V w ≤ 500 ml included Na x CoO 2 as an impurity phase. The Na content decreased with <lb/>increasing V w as seen in Fig. 2(a) which means that the Na ions were partly deintercalated <lb/>in the hydration process[2]. The pH of the water was nearly independent of V w being <lb/>approximately 11 and this fact is consistent with the almost linear decrease of x with <lb/>increasing V w . The hydration proceeded completely only for x ≤ 0.35, and thus for <lb/>V w &gt; 500 ml, <lb/>The relative intensity of the impurity peak at 2θ = 15.9˚to the 002 peak of the <lb/>hydrated phase is shown in Fig. 2(b). After the sample was stored for 10 days under 70% <lb/>humidity, amount of the impurity of Na x CoO 2 decreased in every sample and the 500 ml <lb/>sample became single phase. This suggests that the intercalation and/or deintercalation of <lb/></body>

Obviously, the samples immersed in the water with V w ≤ 300 ml showed better <lb/>superconducting properties, although they are not single phase. On the other hand, the <lb/>superconducting properties changed after the storage as seen in Fig. 4. The superconduct-<lb/>ing properties of the 500 ml and 1000 ml samples were improved drastically after they were <lb/>stored for 2 weeks, while those of the 300 ml sample became rather bad after the 2 month <lb/>storage. These facts are consistent with the idea that, during the storage, the intercalation <lb/>and/or deintercalation of water can proceed through the gas and the Na atoms can also <lb/>be deintercalated being extracted as NaOH.

According to the present <lb/>study, the best synthesis condition is the immersion to 500 ml water for 1 g of the starting <lb/>oxide followed by 2 weeks storage under 70% humidity. <lb/>The M/H-T curves measured under various magnetic fields are shown in Fig. 5. <lb/>The samples A and B are different from those mentioned above. Each sample was single <lb/>phases. The transition temperatures of samples A and B without magnetic field, T c (0), <lb/>are approximately 4.2 and 4.6 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, T c under H ≥ 5 T is <lb/>hard to determine for the both samples, because the superconducting transitions are broad <lb/>[13]. However, it is notable that the superconductivity of sample A is suppressed almost <lb/>completely under 7 T while M/H of sample B shows clear downturn below, at least, 3.5 K <lb/>even under 7 T. Two explanations are possible for this result. First, H c2 depends strongly <lb/>on the sample quality and is improved greatly with slight increase of T c . Second, since 7 T <lb/>M/H-T curves of samples A and B both start to deviate from the linear lines near T c (0) <lb/>(see Fig. 5), their T c do not decrease significantly under 7 T but their superconducting <lb/>volume fractions are different under 7 T. In either case, H c2 seems to be quite high if it is <lb/>measured for a high quality of sample. <lb/>The important thing is that the superconductivity under high magnetic field depends <lb/>strongly on T c , and T c is influenced by the synthesis conditions such as the volume of water <lb/></body>

The dotted lines <lb/>are visual guides. <lb/>in the hydration process or the storage time as mentioned above. This seems to be the <lb/>reason for the inconsistent experimental results reported for the present system especially <lb/>in the estimations of H c2 and the NMR measurements. Our high quality samples with <lb/>high T c values have been investigated by µSR, NMR, specific heat measurements, and <lb/>magnetic measurements[9, 12, 13, 16] to give consistent results. In 1/ 59 T 1 T determined by <lb/>NMR, superconducting transition is detected clearly with T c at approximately 4 K even <lb/>under a high magnetic field of ∼7 T[17] consistent with the high H c2 estimated from the <lb/>specific heat and magnetic measurements. <lb/>IV. Summary <lb/>We synthesized powder samples of Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O by changing the volume of water <lb/>in the hydration process, and investigated their superconducting properties. The single <lb/>phase of Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O was obtained when the volume of water was 500 ml and 1000 <lb/>ml per 1 g of starting materials of Na 0.7 CoO 2 . T c of the sample changed gradually while <lb/>it was stored in the atmosphere of the humidity of 70%. The superconducting properties <lb/>under high magnetic field were very sensitive to T c , and thus, to the synthesis conditions. <lb/>These facts suggest that discrepancies in experimental results for the present compound <lb/>result from the difference in sample quality. H c2 is obviously higher than 7 T in a high <lb/>quality sample. <lb/></body>
