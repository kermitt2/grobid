There are no evidence-based suicide <lb/>prevention interventions developed specifically for autistic people. We undertook a pilot feasibility randomised <lb/>controlled trial of autism adapted safety plans (AASP) to reduce self-harm and suicide for autistic people. <lb/>Methods This study took place in the United Kingdom and followed a randomised, two-arm, controlled design. <lb/>Autistic adults (n = 53, mean age = 39, gender = 49% female, 29% not male or female) were recruited via third <lb/>sector organisations and self-referral between 11.8.21 and 19.10.22. Participants were randomised without <lb/>stratification to usual care with or without AASP. The AASP was completed by the autistic adults together with <lb/>someone trained to support them. Research staff who completed follow-up assessments were blind to participant <lb/>allocation. Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability. Participants were assessed at baseline, 1 and 6 <lb/>months. Primary data were analysed under the intention to treat principle. Study protocol is published. The trial <lb/>is closed to new participants. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN70594445. <lb/>Findings 53 participants consented, 49 were randomised to either AASP with usual care (n = 25) or usual care (n = 24). <lb/>68% of participants in the AASP arm were satisfied with the AASP and 41% rated it as useable. Feedback on the <lb/>AASP and research methods were positive with suggested adaptations to some outcome measures. Retention and <lb/>completion of outcomes measures in both arms was excellent, as was fidelity of delivery of the AASP. <lb/>Interpretation Study progression criteria were met, suggesting that the parameters of a future definitive trial of <lb/>clinical and cost effectiveness of AASP to reduce self-harm and suicide in autistic adults are achievable, with minor <lb/>recommended adaptions to outcome measures and AASP. Future research should explore the use of AASP in routine <lb/>clinical practice. <lb/>Funding This study is funded by the NIHR [Public Health Research Programme (NIHR129196)]. <lb/>Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Autistic people are at high risk of suicide. 1 In the UK, <lb/>autism prevalence is estimated at 1-2% of the general <lb/>population but a recent psychological autopsy study re-<lb/>ported evidence of possible autism amongst 41% of <lb/>people who died by suicide. 2 There are currently no <lb/>evidence-based supports which have been specifically <lb/>developed for autistic people who experience self-harm <lb/>or suicidal thoughts and behaviours, even though <lb/>these experiences are more commonly reported by <lb/>autistic than non-autistic people. 3 Accessing main-<lb/>stream mental health services is often reported to <lb/>contribute to, rather than alleviate, distress for autistic <lb/>people. 4 This reflects growing recognition that the way <lb/>we measure, conceptualise and understand suicide and <lb/>self-harm for the general population does not describe <lb/>the experiences of autistic people. 5 An international <lb/>priority setting exercise has highlighted the importance <lb/>of developing effective tailored clinical tools for suicide <lb/>prevention for autistic people, 6 which has been reiter-<lb/>ated in the new UK suicide prevention strategy <lb/>2023-2028. 7 Overall, this suggests an urgent need for <lb/>data to inform the clinical effectiveness of tailored sui-<lb/>cide prevention approaches for autistic people. This <lb/>study is the first step towards achieving this ultimate <lb/>aim. <lb/>Suicide safety plans are a recommended intervention <lb/>for a range of clinical groups including autistic adults. 8 <lb/>Suicide safety plans are a series of hierarchical steps <lb/>to be followed to help people to stay safe during periods <lb/>of acute crisis that have demonstrated effectiveness in <lb/>reducing self-harm and suicidal behaviour amongst <lb/>non-autistic people. 9,10 They can be delivered by a range <lb/>of professionals and can be adapted to meet the het-<lb/>erogeneous presentations of autistic people, including <lb/>sensory and communication preferences or areas of <lb/>passionate interest. 8 One previous study in the United <lb/>States reported that clinicians were less confident in <lb/>using safety plans with autistic clients, but, as yet there <lb/>is no evidence to inform how to adapt and use safety <lb/>plans with autistic people. 11 Our work developed Autism <lb/>Adapted Safety Plans (adapted from safety plans devel-<lb/>oped by Stanley &amp; Brown), in partnership with autistic <lb/>adults and those who support them. 12,13 However, no <lb/>research has yet tested the feasibility and acceptability of <lb/>AASP, in a randomised controlled trial. <lb/>The primary aim was to establish the feasibility and <lb/>acceptability of the AASP and inform the parameters of <lb/>a definitive randomised controlled trial. Measuring <lb/>outcomes of a mental health or suicide intervention trial <lb/>for autistic people represents a significant challenge <lb/>given evidence that standardised questionnaires <lb/>designed to capture the experiences of non-autistic <lb/>people often lead to spurious results for autistic peo-<lb/>ple. 14,15 Thus, secondary aims of this study are to explore <lb/>the extent to which clinical and health economics out-<lb/>comes can be accurately measured and reported in a <lb/>future definitive trial. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study design <lb/>This is an external pilot randomised control trial of a <lb/>suicide prevention intervention tool aimed at mitigating <lb/>Research in context <lb/>Evidence before this study <lb/>We searched OVID (Psychinfo, Embase and Medline <lb/>databases) for articles published from database inception to <lb/>16 October 2023, with the terms &quot;ASC&quot; or &quot;ASD&quot; or &quot;Asperg*&quot; <lb/>or &quot;Autis*&quot; or &quot;high functioning&quot; or &quot;pervasive developmental <lb/>disorder*&quot; or &quot;PDD&quot; or &quot;HFA and &quot;safety plan*&quot; and &quot;suicid*&quot; <lb/>or &quot;suicide plans&quot; or &quot;suicide attempts&quot; or &quot;attempted suicide&quot; <lb/>or &quot;parasuicide&quot; &quot;self-harm&quot; or &quot;self-inj*&quot; without language <lb/>restrictions. We identified no previous pilot or definitive trials <lb/>of suicide safety plans for autistic adults. One empirical study <lb/>reported that clinicians use safety plans with similar frequency <lb/>for autistic and non-autistic adults but report less confidence <lb/>in using them to support autistic adults. One commentary <lb/>drew together existing evidence in support of safety planning <lb/>as an intervention that has the potential to be tailored to be <lb/>effective for autistic adults. This commentary concludes that <lb/>an evidence-based trial is warranted. Other papers echo these <lb/>findings in children and youth clinical settings though these <lb/>studies are small, draw on practitioner case studies and call for <lb/>larger, formal studies. <lb/>Added value of this study <lb/>This pilot RCT provided important feasibility and acceptability <lb/>data regarding the use of Autism Adapted Safety Plans and <lb/>describing achievable parameters for a future definitive trial to <lb/>test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the AASP to reduce <lb/>suicide and self-harm. Our findings are the first to show that <lb/>autistic adults currently experiencing self-harm and suicidal <lb/>behaviour can be successfully and safely supported to develop <lb/>an AASP with the potential to reduce rates of self-harm and <lb/>suicidal behaviour. We found high rates of retention within <lb/>the study, and overall reports of feasibility and acceptability of <lb/>research processes. <lb/>Implications of all the available evidence <lb/>The AASP is a promising intervention to reduce the incidence <lb/>of self-harm and suicide risk amongst autistic adults. A full-<lb/>scale randomised controlled trial is required to ascertain <lb/>definitive clinical and cost effectiveness. With minor <lb/>adaptations the AASP and study processes can inform the <lb/>delivery of a definitive trial. <lb/></body>

			<body>the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour in autistic <lb/>adults. Participants were assessed at baseline and 1 and <lb/>6-month follow-up. The study was carried out in the <lb/>United Kingdom with participants from diverse loca-<lb/>tions. Ethical approval was obtained from the National <lb/>Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority and <lb/>Wales Research Ethics Committee (Wales REC 5; REC <lb/>Reference: 20/WA/0101; IRAS Project ID: 280742). As <lb/>outlined in the protocol, 12 stage 1 included Patient <lb/>Involvement (PPI) focus groups to inform adaptations to <lb/>the safety plan for autistic people and stage 2 was a <lb/>single arm feasibility study. Progression criteria were <lb/>met to inform this stage 3 pilot study randomised <lb/>controlled trial. <lb/>Participants <lb/>Autistic adults with experience of self-harm, suicidal <lb/>thoughts and behaviours were recruited via non-NHS <lb/>services (charities, higher education and third sector <lb/>organisations) and via self-referral route following social <lb/>media announcements. Inclusion criteria were: (i) a <lb/>formal diagnosis of autism; (ii) accessing services via <lb/>social care or third sector organisation or self-referred <lb/>into the study; (iii) self-reported self-harm, suicidal <lb/>thoughts or behaviours within the last 6 months; (iv) <lb/>sufficient English language fluency to complete the <lb/>safety plan; and (v) aged over 18. Insufficient English <lb/>language fluency and current psychotic symptoms were <lb/>exclusion criteria. Participants self-reported their sex/ <lb/>gender using a free text option and provided written <lb/>informed consent to take part. 32.1% of the sample self-<lb/>reported having completed a safety plan at some point. <lb/>However, no participants reported using safety plans <lb/>currently. <lb/>Randomisation and masking <lb/>Participants completed baseline assessments (see <lb/>Table 1) and were then randomised to receive either the <lb/>AASP in addition to usual care or usual care only, on a 1 <lb/>to 1 basis without stratification. Randomisation was <lb/>done via Sealed Envelope (https://www.sealedenvelope. <lb/>com) facilitated by an unblinded researcher who <lb/>informed participants of their randomisation status. The <lb/>unblinded researcher did not undertake follow up as-<lb/>sessments or data analysis. <lb/>Procedure <lb/>Interested individuals completed an expression of in-<lb/>terest form granting permission for the research team to <lb/>make contact to provide more information.

			<body>who self-referred were either linked to a support worker <lb/>from a partner organisation or completed the AASP with <lb/>a researcher. Data consent, data collection and comple-<lb/>tion of the safety plan took place via telephone or video <lb/>call to meet the access preference of the participant. <lb/>Training for support workers and researchers was co-<lb/>designed with autistic people and included information <lb/>about suicide and self-harm in autistic people, adapta-<lb/>tions from standard safety planning, considerations when <lb/>working with autistic people, helpful insight into autism, <lb/>such as the double empathy problem (where both autistic <lb/>and non-autistic people struggle to understand and <lb/>empathise with one another), 16 opportunities to discuss <lb/>and practise the AASP. With consent AASP completion <lb/>was audio recorded to determine fidelity. Follow up as-<lb/>sessments were undertaken at 1 and 6 months with a full <lb/>list of measures administered at each time point detailed <lb/>below and available in the study protocol. 12 All partici-<lb/>pants completed a wellbeing plan with a researcher prior <lb/>to being randomised. 17 This included information about a <lb/>trusted person to contact if the research team were <lb/>worried about a participants wellbeing. The study also <lb/>utilised a standard operating procedure for categorising <lb/>and reporting SAE and ESI according to funder guide-<lb/>lines, as detailed in the study protocol. 12 <lb/>The AASP <lb/>The original Stanley &amp; Brown safety plan consists of six <lb/>sections, involving the identification of: (1) warning <lb/>signs; (2) internal coping strategies; (3) social contacts <lb/>and locations; (4) family members or friends that may <lb/>offer help; (5) professionals or agencies to help and (6) <lb/>how to keep the environment safe. 9 Adaptations from <lb/>Stage 1 PPI included clarifying the template to meet <lb/>autistic thinking and communication styles, inserting <lb/>&quot;what is important to me&quot; in place of &quot;reasons for <lb/>living&quot;. The AASP was accompanied by an optional <lb/>resource pack, which included tools to identify emo-<lb/>tions, scales, pictorial representations, and support ser-<lb/>vices to support the autistic person. This resource pack <lb/>was developed in collaboration with autistic people, their <lb/>families, and those who support them through PPI <lb/>focus groups in stage one, and feasibility interviews in <lb/>stage two of the study. 13 <lb/>Outcomes <lb/>Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of <lb/>the research methods and the AASP to inform a future <lb/>definitive trial. How feasibility and acceptability would <lb/>be judged were defined a priori in the study protocol 12 : <lb/>we assessed acceptability of outcome measures, inter-<lb/>vention materials, any perceived benefits of the AASP, <lb/>whilst feasibility assessed experience of recruitment and <lb/>randomisation. Specifically, to inform a definitive trial, <lb/>we recorded: (i) number of autistic people who <lb/>completed the AASP; (ii) response rates for completion <lb/>of outcome measures, follow up rates, response rates for <lb/>questionnaires; (iii) time needed to collect and analyse <lb/>data; (iv) feedback from participants and service pro-<lb/>viders on methods of recruitment, randomisation, pro-<lb/>posed outcome measures, possible use of reinforcement <lb/>activities, research procedures and data collection <lb/>methods; (iv) data from participants and service pro-<lb/>viders about what comprises treatment as usual. Pro-<lb/>gression criteria for a definitive trial were: (i) number of <lb/>participants who completed assessments; (ii) the per-<lb/>centage of participants who rate the usability of the <lb/>Safety Plans (SPs) on the System Usability Scale 18 as 68 <lb/>or above; (iii) the percentage of participants who report <lb/>satisfaction with the AASP intervention (indicated as a <lb/>score &gt;20 on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 19 ; <lb/>and (iv) fidelity of delivery of the AASP manual using a <lb/>bespoke fidelity checklist (see Supplementary File S1). <lb/>We collected data on a number of secondary out-<lb/>comes to assess their acceptability and usefulness to be <lb/>able to measure clinical and cost effectiveness of a <lb/>definitive trial. Secondary outcomes included: the Self-<lb/>injurious Thoughts and Behaviours Inventory (SITBI) 20 <lb/>which records the number of incidents of self-harm <lb/>and suicidal thoughts and behaviours in a 6-month <lb/>period. We also assessed suicidal thoughts and behav-<lb/>iours using the Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire -<lb/>Autism Spectrum Condition 21 and a measure of life <lb/>disadvantage using the Vulnerabilities Experience <lb/>Quotient (VEQ). 22 We evaluated the feasibility of health <lb/>economics measures for a future definitive trial by <lb/>determining the acceptability (clarity, ease of use) and <lb/>completeness of bespoke questionnaires about: (i) <lb/>healthcare resource utilisation; and (ii) time and travel <lb/>related to healthcare. Data regarding health-related <lb/>quality of life as a health outcome measure were <lb/>collected using the EQ-5D-5L. 23 The Mini-International <lb/>Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 24 was administered <lb/>at baseline to characterise the sample. <lb/>Choice of primary outcome <lb/>Our primary aim was to establish the feasibility of un-<lb/>dertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial of the <lb/>AASP to determine its effectiveness. To determine this, <lb/>we measured multiple parameters using the: (i) System <lb/>Usability Scale (SUS) 18 and Client Satisfaction <lb/>Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) 19 (administered in the <lb/>AASP + arm only); and (ii) bespoke acceptability and <lb/>feasibility semi-structured interview for autistic adults <lb/>and support workers (see Supplementary File S2). The <lb/>SUS is quick, easy to administer quantitative and can <lb/>reliably differentiate between useable and unusable <lb/>systems in small samples. 18 The CSQ-8 assesses satis-<lb/>faction with care and has high internal consistency and <lb/>good validity in mental health outpatient settings. 19 <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>An overview of the statistical analysis plan is included <lb/>in the protocol, 12 published before the analysis.

			<body>statistical analysis plan and health economics analysis <lb/>plan were signed off prior to beginning the analysis. The <lb/>pilot trial was not designed to estimate a target differ-<lb/>ence in relative effectiveness but to address outcomes to <lb/>estimate the parameters for a future trial. 25,26 However, <lb/>due to difficulties recruiting during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic, the final sample was 53. As this was a pilot <lb/>trial, the reported confidence intervals are for guidance <lb/>only. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat princi-<lb/>ple. Measures of usability (SUS) and satisfaction (CSQ-<lb/>8) were summarized using descriptive statistics in the <lb/>AASP arm only. Analysis of secondary outcomes, <lb/>including SITBI, SBQ-ASC, and VEQ, were analysed <lb/>using logistic regression (binary outcomes) or general <lb/>linear models (continuous outcomes). All models were <lb/>adjusted for baseline values, age, and gender; ethnicity <lb/>was intended to be included as a covariate but due to <lb/>small numbers across groups this was omitted. To <lb/>inform a randomisation scheme for a future definitive <lb/>trial, adaptive LASSO regression models were fit to <lb/>examine associations between multiple demographic <lb/>characteristics (household income, educational attain-<lb/>ment, employment status, housing situation, physical <lb/>health, and service access) and SITBI outcomes, with <lb/>adjustment for allocation and baseline values. De-<lb/>mographics whose coefficients were not forced to zero <lb/>were considered potentially important. This method has <lb/>been recently used to identify predictors of non-suicidal <lb/>self-injury. 27 Acceptability of health economics outcome <lb/>measures was analysed using descriptive statistics <lb/>(number and percentages of questionnaires and <lb/>missing items). Time needed to administer these tools <lb/>was summarised from interviewer/participant notes. <lb/>Safety was analysed in line with the safety reporting <lb/>criteria in the protocol. Only Serious Adverse Events <lb/>(SAEs) were captured for participants, none were ex-<lb/>pected for participants, so all SAEs were classed as un-<lb/>expected. SAEs were tabulated in frequency tables per <lb/>trial arms, action taken, outcome and causality in the <lb/>opinion of the investigator. Events of special interest <lb/>(ESI) e.g., participant no longer attending work/college, <lb/>relationship breakdown, housing/financial changes, <lb/>mental health decline -were summarised per trial arm <lb/>using frequency tables. Analyses were undertaken in R <lb/>and Excel. This study is registered with the ISRCTN <lb/>registry, ISRCTN70594445. <lb/>An independent rater (IG) was randomly allocated <lb/>20% of recorded AASP sessions to rate for fidelity, using a <lb/>checklist with a three-point scale (see Supplementary File <lb/>S1). An additional independent rater (JR) met with IG to <lb/>ensure inter-rater reliability using the fidelity checklist. <lb/>Role of the funding source <lb/>This study was funded by National Institute for Health <lb/>Research (grant number: PHR NIHR129196). The <lb/>funders had no role in study design, data collection, data <lb/>analysis, data interpretation or writing of this report. <lb/>Results <lb/>Recruitment took place between 11.8.21 and 19.10.22. <lb/>The first participant was consented 11/8/21 and the last <lb/>participant was consented 19/10/22. The last participant <lb/>completed their final follow up assessment 25/4/23. The <lb/>database was locked on 20/06/23 and the SAP was first <lb/>approved 17/05/23. Of the 53 participants consented, <lb/>four were not randomised due to withdrawal (n = 2) or <lb/>lost contact (n = 2). Forty-nine participants were rand-<lb/>omised to either AASP + usual care (n = 25) or usual <lb/>care (n = 24). One participant in the AASP arm was lost <lb/>to contact after randomisation; all participants were <lb/>retained in the usual care arm. In the AASP arm, seven <lb/>and two participants did not complete any assessments <lb/>at 1 and 6 months, respectively (see Fig. 1). <lb/>Participant characteristics are summarised in <lb/>Table 1. The mean age of participants was 39 years <lb/>(range 18-70) and mean age at diagnosis of autism was <lb/>31 years (range 2-58 years). Approximately half the <lb/>sample identified as female, and 29% identified with a <lb/>gender other than man or woman. In both trial arms, <lb/>the most common mental health diagnosis at baseline <lb/>based on the MINI questionnaire was generalised anx-<lb/>iety disorder, followed by post-traumatic stress disorder <lb/>and current suicidality (Table 1). <lb/>All retained participants randomised to the AASP <lb/>completed a safety plan. Completion of the outcomes <lb/>measures was high. Retention of those randomised was <lb/>excellent to six-month follow-up (95%). Twenty-two <lb/>participants in the AASP completed the SUS. Scores <lb/>on the SUS can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores <lb/>indicating better usability. The mean score was 61.2 (SD <lb/>20.5; range of 19-96). Nine respondents (41%) reported <lb/>a score of 68 or higher, indicating satisfaction with us-<lb/>ability. Satisfaction with the AASP was assessed using <lb/>the CSQ-8. Of the 19 AASP participants who completed <lb/>the CSQ-8, the mean score was 24.8 (SD 6.5; range <lb/>10-32. Thirteen respondents (68%) indicated they were <lb/>satisfied with the intervention based on a CSQ-8 score <lb/>greater than 20. <lb/>Descriptive statistics and analyses of the SITBI <lb/>questionnaire are shown in Supplementary File S3 <lb/>(Tables 1 and 2). Participants were asked to indicate <lb/>whether they had ever experienced each of the thoughts/ <lb/>behaviours ever in their life (baseline) or in the past <lb/>month (at one and six months). Except for gestures, the <lb/>vast majority of respondents in both arms had reported <lb/>experiencing each of the thoughts/behaviours at base-<lb/>line (Supplementary File S3, Supplementary Table S1). <lb/>These proportions were smaller at one-and six-month <lb/>follow-up, although a large proportion in both arms <lb/>(&gt;20%, sometimes up to 96%) reported NA/unable to <lb/>answer across domains, except for attempts at six <lb/>months where &gt;85% answered yes or no. <lb/>The SITBI also asked participants how likely they <lb/>were to have thought/behaviour in the future. Mean <lb/>likelihood scores for each domain at each time point are <lb/></body>

At baseline, the mean score in the <lb/>AASP + usual care arm was 16.48 (SD 2.77) and the <lb/>mean score in the usual care arm was 15.05 (SD 3.17) <lb/>(Supplementary File S3, Supplementary Fig. S2). <lb/>Response to a singular question on the SBQ-ASC, <lb/>&apos;When you experience intense thoughts about ending <lb/>your life, how likely are you to act on them?&apos;, was also <lb/>explored separately in a pre-specified analysis. Mean <lb/>responses to this question at baseline and 6 months, <lb/>respectively, were 2.95 (SD 1.95) and 2.95 (SD 1.22) in <lb/>the AASP arm and 2.88 (SD 1.12) and 3.00 (SD 1.27) in <lb/>the usual care arm. <lb/>Descriptive statistics and analysis of the VEQ, in <lb/>which higher scores correspond to more negative life <lb/>experiences in ten different domains and summed <lb/>overall, are shown in Supplementary File S3, <lb/>Supplementary Table S1. <lb/>Table 2 shows the results of applying the adaptive <lb/>LASSO method, with univariate logistic regression for <lb/>comparison, to explore the associations between base-<lb/>line sociodemographic variables and binary SITBI out-<lb/>comes at six months. Broadly speaking, education level <lb/>and employment status were most consistently retained <lb/>in the adaptive LASSO models: compared with educa-<lb/>tion to A-levels or below, education to a postgraduate <lb/>level was associated with lower likelihood of ideation, <lb/>NSSI, and any behaviour, while self-employment was <lb/>associated with lower likelihood of suicide plans, NSSI, <lb/>and any behaviour at six months. This suggests educa-<lb/>tion level and/or employment status may be important <lb/>stratification variables in future definitive trials. <lb/>All the participants in the study responded to the <lb/>health economics questionnaire tools. The completion <lb/>rates when measured as a proportion of all returned <lb/>questionnaires were generally high (&gt;85%) in both <lb/>groups of participants. In a definitive trial data from the <lb/>Resource Utilisation Questionnaire will be used to <lb/>determine TAU. Completion rates were excellent for <lb/>most items across all time point, however there were <lb/>lower completion rates (∼42% in the comparator and ∼ <lb/>52% in the intervention at follow-up) for a question on <lb/>medication details. It is reasonable to have lower <lb/>completion rates for this question on medication details <lb/>as it would generally be hard to recall the drug dose, <lb/>start date or end date of all the medication the partici-<lb/>pants listed. However, the participants in this study <lb/>were very committed to providing accurate data and so <lb/>would rather not answer when they were not sure. The <lb/>completion rates for time travel questionnaire (&gt;79% in <lb/>both groups), EQ-5D-5L (∼96%) and EQ-5D-VAS <lb/>(∼87%) were also high. Overall, the health economics <lb/>analysis showed that it would be feasible to collect data <lb/>from autistic participants using the resource utilisation, <lb/>time-travel questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L (including the <lb/>EQ-5D-VAS) in a future definitive trial. <lb/>Forty-seven interviews were undertaken with partic-<lb/>ipants after the completion of the six-month follow-up. <lb/>All interviews included information regarding the <lb/>research process (see Supplementary File S2). Partici-<lb/>pants generally found the research methods to be <lb/>Fig. 1: Trial profile. <lb/></body>

			<body>acceptable. The research process was seen as well-<lb/>designed and accessible for autistic people due to the <lb/>flexible approach which accommodated individual <lb/>needs. However standardized measures needed less <lb/>ambiguous language and space for open questions to <lb/>capture the autistic experience of suicidality. Most par-<lb/>ticipants experienced benefits from taking part in the <lb/>research, including contributing to autism research, <lb/>increased self-understanding, validation and being able <lb/>to express themselves. <lb/>Participants in the AASP arm completed additional <lb/>questions related to the Safety Plan. They reported a <lb/>helpful process, receiving varying levels of support to <lb/>identify and communicate their feelings, needs and ex-<lb/>periences. They were motivated to use it by meaningful <lb/>content and varied formats and suggested different <lb/>versions, further prompts and navigation to increase <lb/>usage. <lb/>In the AASP arm there were 3 Serious Adverse <lb/>Events (SAEs) impacting 3 participants and there were <lb/>8 Events of Special Interest (ESIs) impacting 5 <lb/>participants. In the control arm there were 9 SAEs <lb/>impacting 5 participants and 16 ESIs impacting 11 <lb/>participants. None were related to study participation. <lb/>Analysis of fidelity of delivery of the AASP was un-<lb/>dertaken by an independent rater (IG). An additional <lb/>independent rater (JR) met with IG to ensure inter-rater <lb/>reliability using the fidelity checklist. 20% (n = 5) of <lb/>AASP session recordings were assessed for therapeutic <lb/>components and adherence to content.

            <body>adaptations to outcome measures to clarify language <lb/>and better capture autistic experiences of self-harm and <lb/>suicidality. There was excellent retention in both the <lb/>AASP and control arms, and the majority of all study <lb/>outcome measures were completed with few missing <lb/>data points. Fidelity of delivery of AASP was excellent. <lb/>Results suggest that a definitive randomised <lb/>controlled trial to determine the effectiveness and cost-<lb/>effectiveness of AASPs is feasible and acceptable. <lb/>However, results also suggest that some minor changes <lb/>are needed to the outcome measures and to the AASP <lb/>prior to a future definitive trial. For example, the SUS <lb/>indicated that 41% of autistic participants rated the <lb/>AASPs as useable. However, this is not surprising as <lb/>the scale prioritises patients being able to complete the <lb/>intervention independently and quickly, whereas feed-<lb/>back from autistic adults indicated that they required a <lb/>flexible approach to completing AASP, with support of a <lb/>trusted person to help identify warning signs and <lb/>coping strategies, across more than one session if <lb/>needed. Autistic adults also suggested adaptations to <lb/>measures to make them clearer and more relevant to <lb/>their unique experiences. These results are consistent <lb/>with previous research, showing that outcome measures <lb/>and interventions developed for the general population <lb/>need to be adapted to better meet the needs of autistic <lb/>people, including clearer language/instructions, more <lb/>time for processing and to build rapport, and support to <lb/>identify warning signs and support strategies. 13,21,28,29 <lb/>There is evidence that safety plans can reduce self-<lb/>harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours in a wide <lb/>range of clinical groups, 10 and safety plans have been <lb/>recommended for use with autistic adults. 8 Ours is the <lb/>first study of AASP. Limitations include the small <lb/>sample size below the initially intended sample of 70 <lb/>participants due to difficulties with recruitment during <lb/>the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is no single <lb/>recommended sample size for a pilot or feasibility study, <lb/>and the data gathered from the sample was sufficient to <lb/>estimate the parameters of a future definitive trial. As <lb/>autistic participants self-referred into the study from <lb/>public adverts, data are not available regarding how <lb/>many participants were approached with an invitation to <lb/>take part in the study, compared to how many of these <lb/>participants consented to take part. The study sample <lb/>was not representative of the autism population gener-<lb/>ally. However, the high rates of low income, non-binary <lb/>gender, female gender and late diagnosis of autism in <lb/>adulthood may actually be representative of autistic <lb/>people at higher risk of self-harm and suicide. 5 Never-<lb/>theless, a future definitive trial will need to take further <lb/>steps to ensure a more representative sample, particu-<lb/>larly in terms of ethnicity. Autistic participants particu-<lb/>larly favoured the flexible approach to the research and <lb/>AASP, with one of the key adaptations of the opportu-<lb/>nity of completing the plan with a trusted person across <lb/>more than one session if needed. 13 Such adaptations <lb/>have been shown to improve effectiveness of other <lb/>autism adapted interventions 28,29 and will also likely be <lb/>needed for the AASP. 13 However, this does mean that <lb/>AASPs may be more feasible to be conducted in settings <lb/>with repeat appointments with patients (e.g., longer <lb/>term psychological therapy), as opposed to more time <lb/>pressured environments such as emergency de-<lb/>partments. Additionally, clinicians in time pressured <lb/>contexts may choose not to take up the AASP for the <lb/>autistic people they support in favour of the original <lb/>briefer version of the safety plan. Future research <lb/>should explore clinician uptake of AASP in different <lb/>clinical settings, and what key components of AASP <lb/>could be prioritised in more time pressured clinical <lb/>settings. <lb/>Despite autistic people being at high risk of self-<lb/>harm and suicide, this study addressed a key research <lb/>gap, namely that there are no suicide prevention in-<lb/>terventions yet developed or evaluated in this group. <lb/>Previous research has shown that outcome measures <lb/>and interventions adapted for autistic adults improve the <lb/>appropriateness and effectiveness of these tools. 21,28,29 In <lb/>England, the new government suicide prevention strat-<lb/>egy 7 prioritises adapted suicide prevention interventions <lb/>such as safety plans developed with and for autistic <lb/>people. The present findings from the first pilot rand-<lb/>omised control trial of autism adapted safety plans <lb/>suggests that a future definitive trial testing the efficacy <lb/>of AASP is both feasible and acceptable. Future research <lb/>should further explore the effectiveness and cost-<lb/>effectiveness of AASP in routine clinical practice. <lb/></body>
