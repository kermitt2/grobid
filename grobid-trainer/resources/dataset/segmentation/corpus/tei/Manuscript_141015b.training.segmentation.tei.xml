			<front>Abstract <lb/>This paper focuses on the effects of the observation scale and sampling on the dispersion of tracers in <lb/>periodical heterogeneous porous media. A Model Heterogeneous Porous Medium (MHPM) with a <lb/>high degree of heterogeneity was built. It consists of a preferential flow path surrounded by glass <lb/>beads. 44 tracer experiments were carried out on several series of periodic MHPM to investigate the <lb/>effect of the observation scale on solute dispersion. Each series was replicated several times, allowing <lb/>for a statistical description of the unit transfer function of the MHPM. No significant trend was found <lb/>for the dispersion coefficient as a function of the size of the MHPM. However, given the variability of <lb/>the breakthrough curves from one experiment replicate to another, under-sampling might easily lead to <lb/>conclude that the dispersion coefficient is variable with distance. Depending on the samples used, it <lb/>would be as easy to (wrongly) detect an increasing trend as to detect a decreasing one. A confidence <lb/>interval analysis of the experimental breakthrough curves in the Laplace space shows that (i) there <lb/>exists a model with scale independent parameters that can describe the experimental breakthrough <lb/>curves within the limits of experimental uncertainty, (ii) this model is not the Advection-Dispersion <lb/>(AD) model, (iii) the modelling error of the AD model decreases with the number of periods, (iv) the <lb/>size of the Reference Elementary Volume for the dispersion coefficient is between 10 and 20 periods. <lb/>The effects of sampling prove to override those of scaling. This, with the invalidity of the AD model, <lb/>leads to question attempts to calibrate and/or identify trends in the dispersion coefficient at <lb/>intermediate scales from a limited number of experiment replicates. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>Dispersion modelling <lb/>Intermediate Scale Experiment <lb/>Heterogeneous media <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Understanding solute transport in porous media is important to predict the fate of contaminants in <lb/>natural soils. Natural soils are highly heterogeneous and implicate various transport mechanisms. <lb/>Tracer experiments on laboratory soil columns made a big contribution to identify these mechanisms. <lb/>The most widespread transport model for inert solute is the Advection-Dispersion (AD) model. Fitting <lb/>this model against real-world tracer tests has been reported to induce an increase in the dispersion <lb/>coefficient with the travelled distance (see e.g. Dagan, 1989; Gelhar et al., 1992; Zhou and Selim, <lb/>2003). The variability of the dispersion coefficient with distance has motivated a strong interest for <lb/>alternative models. Recently, laboratory tracer experiments have been used as a benchmarking basis to <lb/>test the respective accuracy of a variety of normal and anomalous transport models (see e.g. the review <lb/>in Gao et al., 2009). It has also been suggested by some authors that the dispersion coefficient in <lb/>mobile-immobile models should be made exponentially dependent on distance in order to accurately <lb/>reproduce experimental breakthrough curves in laboratory column experiments (Gao et al., 2010). <lb/>A number of laboratory tracer experiments in porous media are available from the literature (Silliman <lb/>et al., 1998). Laboratory experiments on heterogeneous porous media are very few in comparison to <lb/>those done on homogeneous porous media. One cause might be the practical difficulty to conceive and <lb/>construct heterogeneous porous media. <lb/>Silliman and Simpson (1987) used fine sand inclusions (small cubes) with coarse sand surrounding. <lb/>They found a change in the shape of the breakthrough curve at each of five measurement sections, and <lb/>inferred a continuous increase in dispersivity with distance. Saiers et al. (1994) used a coarse sand <lb/>inclusion (tubule) with finer sand surrounding. The inclusion constituted a preferential flow path and <lb/>contributed to more than 60% of the mass balance. The breakthrough curves exhibited multiple <lb/>inflection points that cannot be accounted for by the classical Advection Dispersion (AD) model. In <lb/>comparison to other studies, the work of Saiers et al. (1994) is distinguished by the high degree of <lb/>heterogeneity of the porous media. This fact is reflected in the shape of the breakthrough curves. Much <lb/>

			more than a mere tailing effect, the breakthrough curves exhibited a clear two-step shape. Li et al. <lb/>(1994) used coarse inclusions (polyethylene porous cylinders) with finer sand surrounding. The <lb/>resulting breakthrough curves exhibited asymmetry. Huang et al. (1995) used a 12.5 m long column <lb/>with a wide range of soil materials. Their breakthrough curves exhibited irregular and nonsigmoidal <lb/>distributions and were in most cases poorly described by the AD model. <lb/>Sternberg et al. (1996) and Irwin et al. (1996) were the first to use a periodical heterogeneous porous <lb/>media, where the heterogeneity consisted of a succession of several glass bead sets tested in several <lb/>serial orders. The breakthrough curves were used to infer the variation of the dispersion coefficient <lb/>with distance. Unfortunately, the breakthrough curves are not shown in the publications and no <lb/>estimate is provided for the goodness-of-fit of the AD model. It is thus impossible to determine <lb/>whether fitting the coefficients of the AD model was meaningful. However, both studies present the <lb/>results of dispersion estimations. Sternberg et al. (1996) found that dispersion does not necessarily <lb/>increase with scale, but that it can increase and decrease depending on the particular arrangement of <lb/>properties in the medium. They deduced that the system length was unimportant in observing the scale <lb/>effect. Conversely, in the study of Irwin et al. (1996), dispersion appeared to be scale dependent up to <lb/>a certain travel distance. But, quoting the authors&apos; own words, &quot;because of the scatter in the data, it <lb/>could be argued that the apparent increase in longitudinal dispersion is simply a result of the variation <lb/>in the data&quot;. This raises the issue of sampling effects. <lb/>Greiner et al. (1997) used aggregates of lower permeability in a surrounding of higher permeability. <lb/>Niehren and Kinzelbach (1998) used cylindrical cellpore filters (less permeable) in a quartzsand <lb/>surrounding (more permeable). Tran Ngoc et al. (2011) used spherical clay inclusions (micro porosity) <lb/>surrounded by sand (macro porosity). Danquigny et al. (2004) performed tracer tests on two kinds of <lb/>heterogeneous porous material: a channel structured medium (5.6m×1m×1m), with channels crossing <lb/>the whole tank, and a statistically correlated random structure. They found that the breakthrough <lb/>curves of the statistically correlated random structure could be fitted with the AD model (at least for <lb/>long distances), but that the fit is quite poor for channel structured model due to the non-Gaussian <lb/>distribution of the concentration. <lb/>Zin et al. (2004) designed an artificial porous medium with several conductivity contrasts, using low <lb/>conductivity inclusions (small beads) surrounded by a high conductivity matrix (large beads). They <lb/>found that the breakthrough curves of the low-contrast medium showed no tailing, while those of high-<lb/>contrast medium showed tailing. Golfier et al. (2011) used fine sand inclusions (lenses) with coarse <lb/>sand surrounding. Their breakthrough curves showed asymmetry. The low degree of heterogeneity in <lb/>the studies of Sternberg et al. (1996) and Irwin et al. (1996) might have led to some contradictory <lb/>conclusions concerning the dispersion scale dependence. As to the study of Saiers et al. (1994), the <lb/>authors were not mainly interested in the problematic of dispersion scale dependence, but rather in <lb/>colloidal mobilization and transport in a structured porous media. <lb/>In the light of the abovementioned studies, it appears that studying the effect of heterogeneity on <lb/>solute transport requires two conditions: (i) a high degree of heterogeneity of the porous media (as the <lb/>experimental model of Saiers et al. (1994)), and (ii) a periodical heterogeneous porous media (as the <lb/>experimental protocol of Sternberg et al. (1996) and Irwin et al. (1996)). The first condition guarantees <lb/>that the effects of material heterogeneity are clearly visible, while the second allows the influence of <lb/>scale effects to be assessed. This also allows for a better quality of the experimental data, with easily <lb/>replicable experiments yielding reliable statistics. <lb/>In this study, we conceived a Model Heterogeneous Porous Medium (MHPM) with a high degree of <lb/>heterogeneity. The purpose is to (i) enrich the experimental database of laboratory tracer tests with <lb/>high quality data, (ii) answer the following six questions. <lb/>(Q1) Can a scaling trend be observed for the dispersion coefficient in this highly heterogeneous <lb/>MHPM? <lb/>(Q2) If this is not the case, can the variations of the dispersion with the observation scale be <lb/>attributed to experimental artefacts such as sampling effects? <lb/></body>

			<body>(Q3) Does there exist a model with uniform coefficients (thus scale-independent) to describe <lb/>adequately the present MHPM response? <lb/>(Q4) Can the AD model be considered valid at the scale of this MHPM? <lb/>(Q5) If it cannot, does a scale exist above which the AD model can be deemed a satisfactory <lb/>approximation of the experimental response of the MHPM? <lb/>(Q6) Can more advanced models such as the Mobile-Immobile (MI) or Continuous Time Random <lb/>Walk (CTRW) models be considered as better candidates than the AD model to simulate small-<lb/>distance and short-time MHPM behaviour? <lb/>The detailed characteristics of the experimental setup is described in Section 2 of the paper. The <lb/>results of experimental breakthrough curves are shown in Section 3. Such experiments are usually <lb/>termed Intermediate Scale Experiments (ISE) in that they involve a scale larger than the typical size of <lb/>the heterogeneity but they do not achieve the size of the Reference Elementary Volume (REV) above <lb/>which the continuous medium formalism should be expected to be valid (Bear, 1972). <lb/>Section 3 is also devoted to an analysis of the transfer function of the MHPM. Section 4 is devoted to <lb/>discussion. A point-by-point answer to the six questions above is given throughout Section 3 and 4. <lb/>2. Materials and methods <lb/>2.1 Model heterogeneous porous media <lb/>The MHPM consists of a set of PVC columns (10 cm in diameter, 15 cm in length each) containing <lb/>1 mm glass spheres (40 % porosity) surrounding a cylindrical cavity (2.5 cm in diameter, 10 cm in <lb/>length) placed in the centre of the column (Figure 1). The cylindrical cavity has 100 % porosity and <lb/>thus acts as a wide pore that induces preferential water and solute transfer. The pore volume V 0 of one <lb/>MHPM period is about 461 ml. <lb/>The water and solute flow enters and leaves the column by 4 inlets and outlets (4 mm in diameter). A <lb/>500 µm sieve prevents the glass spheres from clogging the inlets and outlets, possibly blocking the <lb/>flow. Figure 2 shows real captures of the MHPM. The incoming discharge (imposed by a peristaltic <lb/>pump) is equally distributed between the 4 inlets. It is expected that the flow of the central inlet will <lb/>mainly transfer through the central cavity, while the flow of the three remaining inlets will mainly <lb/>transfer through the surrounding glass beads. <lb/>After carrying out the series of experiments, four randomly chosen columns were disassembled. In <lb/>each of them, the position of the sieve was compared to what it was before the experiment. No <lb/>detectable displacement was noted. <lb/>2.2 Experimental setup <lb/>Step tracing experiments are done by injecting salty water (deionised water supplemented with NaCl <lb/>at C 0 = 0.1 Mol/l) in a study column initially containing deionised water. A flow of 7.5 l h -1 salty water <lb/>is induced into the study column until the outlet concentration C stabilizes to C 0 . In these experiments, <lb/>the stable C 0 level was generally reached after injecting three times the pore volume V 0 of the study <lb/>column. The outlet concentration is measured using a conductimeter (WTW TetraCon 325) and saved <lb/>on a data logger (Campbell CR1000) every 5 s. The cumulated outlet volume V is measured by <lb/>weighing the effluent every 5 s and saved on the data logger (Figure 3). <lb/>The study column consists of a series of N connected MHPM. In this study, four series were <lb/>investigated with N = 3, 5, 10 and 15. The series with N = 3 corresponds to the smallest scale of <lb/>periodical heterogeneity because the first MHPM has a divergent flow inlet and a parallel flow outlet <lb/>while the last MHPM has a parallel flow inlet and a convergent flow outlet. Only the in-between <lb/>MHPM have the same parallel flow inlets and outlets (Figure 3). Therefore, N = 3, 5, 10, and 15 <lb/>correspond to 1, 3, 8, and 13 periodical heterogeneities. <lb/>In this study, 15 MHPM columns were built, named A, B, C,…, N, O. For each series, four replicates <lb/>of the step tracing experiment were conducted for four 90° rotations of the study column, from which <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>a mean breakthrough curve was deduced. The purpose of the 90° rotation is to eliminate biases <lb/>resulting from a possible interaction between density-driven effects and the 120° spacing between the <lb/>column inlets and outlets.

Experimental results <lb/>3.1 Experimental breakthrough curve <lb/>For each value of N, four experimental signals are computed: the average breakthrough concentration <lb/>) <lb/>(t <lb/>C , its standard deviation C <lb/> , the minimum and maximum breakthrough concentrations, defined as <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>max <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>), <lb/>( <lb/>min <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>, <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>, <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>max <lb/>min <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>R <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>R <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>R <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>C <lb/>R <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>(1) <lb/>where C i (t) is the concentration at time t for the ith replicate and R is the number of replicates. The <lb/>standard deviation and the difference between the minimum and maximum signals provide a measure <lb/>of experiment variability. <lb/>Figure 4 (top) shows the experimental signals obtained for the four values N = 3, 5, 10 and 15. As <lb/>expected from previously published studies (Danquigny et al., 2004; Huang et al., 1995; Saiers et al., <lb/>1994), the breakthrough curve for small N strongly differs from the analytical S-shaped solution of the <lb/>AD model (see the graphs for N = 3, N = 5). As N increases, however, the breakthrough curves tend to <lb/>behave similarly to a classical advection-dispersion model output (N = 10 and N = 15 in Figure 4). <lb/>It is also worth stressing the strong variability of the breakthrough curve from one replicate to another <lb/>for a given N. The amplitude of the standard deviation <lb/>) <lb/>(t <lb/>C <lb/> <lb/>shown in Figure 4 is consistently about <lb/>5×10 -2 regardless of N. The amplitude of the min-max interval seems to decrease for larger N, but this <lb/>might be due only to the smaller number of experiments (the min and max indicators being biased <lb/>contrarily to the standard deviation). <lb/>This experimental result has two main consequences. First, it clearly shows that the observed <lb/>behaviour (atypical or typical breakthrough curve) depends on the observation scale. Second, it leads <lb/>to question the use of the AD approach to model solute transfer in porous media for small spatial <lb/>scales. Indeed, the AD is adequate to reproduce breakthrough curves with a typical &apos;S&apos; shape but not <lb/>those with atypical behaviour. Several studies on heterogeneous porous media have already shown that <lb/>the AD model is inadequate to describe the resulting breakthrough curves (Saiers et al., 1994; Huang <lb/>et al., 1995; Danquigny et al., 2004; Li et al., 1994). <lb/>Additional information is brought by the Laplace transform of dC*/dt (t) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>0 <lb/>d <lb/>) <lb/>exp( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>t <lb/>st <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>s <lb/>s <lb/>P <lb/>(2) <lb/>where s is the Laplace variable. Since the input concentration is a unit step, P(s) is the Laplace <lb/>transform of the response of the N columns to a concentration unit pulse. The graphs P(s) are shown in <lb/>Figure 4 (bottom). The graphs are drawn for <lb/>Hz <lb/>1 <lb/>. <lb/>0 <lb/> <lb/>s <lb/>because the sampling time step is 5 seconds, <lb/>thus making the numerical computation of (2) inaccurate for larger s. The response P(s) behaves as a <lb/>decreasing exponential for large s, as indicated by the linear asymptote in the graphs (P is plotted <lb/>using logarithmic coordinates). This is the typical signature of a delay. That the asymptotic linear <lb/>

			behaviour is reached for smaller s as N increases indicates that advection phenomena become <lb/>predominant as N increases, a well-known feature of the advection-dispersion model for increasing <lb/>Peclet number values. This, however, is not sufficient to validate the AD model, an issue that is <lb/>addressed in Section 4.1. <lb/>3.2 Scaling trend for the dispersion coefficient <lb/>Questions (Q1) and (Q2) are answered assuming that the AD model is valid, with governing equations <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>D <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>u <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/>(3a) <lb/>  <lb/>L <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>, <lb/>) <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>( <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>(3b) <lb/>where D is the dispersion coefficient, and u the flow velocity.

Several remarks can be made at this stage. <lb/>Firstly, the variations in the average D with L are smaller than the standard deviation of D for any <lb/>given L. Since the individual variations between the replicates for a given N override by far any visible <lb/>trend, it can be concluded that no significant trend of distance-dependent dispersion D(L) is detected <lb/>given the experimental uncertainty. <lb/>Secondly, given the range of variations between the minimum and maximum values, it is possible to <lb/>find a sequence among all the experimental values in Tables A1-4 such that an increasing trend D(L) <lb/>is detected. An example of such a sequence is (ABC1, ABCDE2, A-J4, A-O4). But it would be just as <lb/>easy to detect a decreasing trend D(L) by choosing the values in Tables A1-4 appropriately, for <lb/>instance the sequence (KLM4, FGHIJ3, K-O2, A-O3). Such trends, however, would only be sampling <lb/>artefacts. <lb/>It can be concluded as an answer to question (Q1) that, in the limit of experimental uncertainty, no <lb/>significant scaling trend can be identified for the dispersion coefficient in the present MHPM. As an <lb/></body>

Since the various replicates C i (t) all <lb/>give different time series for a given number N of columns, the unit transfer function is different for <lb/>each replicate. The proposed approach consists in determining the envelope of all possible C(t) signals <lb/>for a Dirac input.

Discussion <lb/>4.1 Validity of the AD model <lb/>The purpose of the present section is to answer questions (Q4-5).

The L 2 -norm for N = 1 is large, <lb/>indicating that the AD model provides a poor description of the transfer process at the scale of a single <lb/>column. However, the L 2 -norm decreases quickly with N, which is an indication that the AD model <lb/>gains worth with the number of MHPM periods. The driving mechanism for this is interesting to <lb/>notice. As shown by Figures 6a-g, the AD transfer function lies outside the confidence interval for <lb/>s &gt; 3×10 -2 Hz in all graphs. In other words, in terms of relative error, the AD model is equally <lb/>inaccurate for all values of N. However, the amplitude of the transfer function decreases quickly as N <lb/>increases. The absolute value of the error thus becomes smaller as N increases. <lb/>N <lb/>D <lb/>u <lb/>L 2 <lb/>Figure <lb/>1 <lb/>1.57×10 -4 <lb/>1.98×10 -3 <lb/>2.13×10 -3 <lb/>6a <lb/>3 <lb/>2.85×10 -4 <lb/>1.18×10 -3 <lb/>1.27×10 -4 <lb/>6b <lb/>5 <lb/>2.36×10 -4 <lb/>9.98×10 -4 <lb/>1.70×10 -6 <lb/>6c <lb/>10 <lb/>2.24×10 -4 <lb/>7.97×10 -4 <lb/>1.75×10 -10 <lb/>6d <lb/>15 <lb/>2.07×10 -4 <lb/>7.71×10 -4 <lb/>6.51×10 -15 <lb/>6e <lb/>20 <lb/>2.07×10 -4 <lb/>7.71×10 -4 <lb/>2.045×10 -18 <lb/>6f <lb/>30 <lb/>2.07×10 -4 <lb/>7.71×10 -4 <lb/>2.66×10 -25 <lb/>6g <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>Note that the value for D is found to be consistently about 2×10 -4 m 2 s -1 (except for N = 3), while <lb/>formula (7) gives an average value of about 1.2×10 -4 m 2 s -1 (see Table 2). This striking difference <lb/>between the two sets of values can be explained by the calibration approach. The values given in <lb/>Table are computed separately for each individual experiment, under the assumption that the AD <lb/>model provides an accurate description of the transport processes for each experiment. However, a <lb/>(D, u) combination calibrated for a given replicate will fail totally to predict the behaviour of another <lb/>replicate. <lb/>In contrast, the dispersion coefficient values in Table 3 account for the variability of experimental <lb/>uncertainty. It is not requested that the AD model should satisfy each individual experiment as <lb/>accurately as possible, but that its response should lie within the intersection of all the confidence <lb/>intervals associated with different MHPM lengths. As a consequence, smoother unit responses (thus <lb/>larger dispersion coefficient values) are allowed compared to the former approach. Moreoever, both <lb/>calibration approaches use different variables (pointwise C(t) values in the first approach, <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>( <lb/>s <lb/>Nl <lb/>C <lb/>over an interval in the second approach). <lb/>4.2 Validity of alternate transport models <lb/>This section is motivated by Question (Q6). Since the classical AD model fails to reproduce the unit <lb/>pulse response of the column, the question arises whether alternate transport models may be more <lb/>successful. To start with, examining Figure (5g) indicates an asymptotically linear behaviour in semi-<lb/>logarithmic coordinates. In other words, the unit transfer function is asymptotically equivalent to a <lb/>decreasing exponential in the Laplace space. The experimental unit transfer function thus verifies the <lb/>following property: <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>t <lb/>f <lb/>Bx <lb/>t <lb/>H <lb/>t <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>Bxs <lb/>A <lb/>s <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>t <lb/>s <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>exp <lb/>, <lb/>(14) <lb/>where A and B are constants and H is Heaviside&apos;s step function. In other words, the signal propagates <lb/>at a finite velocity B -1 , with a breakthrough concentration rising from 0 at t = Bx to 1 for <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>t <lb/>. The <lb/>inadequacy of the AD model for small times and distances precisely stems from the infinite front <lb/>propagation speed associated with the Fickian flux model. <lb/>The Mobile-Immobile (MI) model (Van Genuchten and Wierenga, 1977) is one of the earliest and <lb/>most probably best-known non-Fickian models for dispersion. Later on, generalizations such as the <lb/>multirate model (Haggeerty and Gorelick, 1995) have been proposed. The governing equations for the <lb/>MI model are: <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>m <lb/>i <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>C <lb/>C <lb/>k <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>D <lb/>x <lb/>C <lb/>u <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>(15a) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>i <lb/>m <lb/>i <lb/>C <lb/>C <lb/>k <lb/>t <lb/>C <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>1 <lb/>(15b) <lb/>where C i and C m are respectively the concentrations in the immobile and mobile regions, k is an <lb/>exchange rate constant and  is the relative volume fraction of the mobile region.

			<body>Although attractive in theory, anomalous transport models may fail in a number of cases, not because <lb/>they are not valid in general, but because they are not applied at the right space/time scales. Fractional <lb/>derivatives are introduced in anomalous transport models under the assumption of heavy-tailed <lb/>waiting time and travel distances probability density functions. The CTRW analysis (Klafter et al., <lb/>1987; Metzler and Klafter, 2000) shows that fractional derivatives stem naturally from this assumption <lb/>as the Laplace variable s tends to zero. For the CTRW analysis to be valid, the observation time and/or <lb/>travelled distance must be sufficient for a significantly large number of solute molecule jumps to <lb/>occur. Moreover, the solute must cover a sufficient number of medium heterogeneities so that the <lb/>ergodicity of the transport process be ensured. This underlying assumption is in contradiction with the <lb/>present experimental setup, that obviously deals with space and time scales smaller than those required <lb/>for ergodicity. As mentioned by Gao et al. (2009), the reason why anomalous transport models may <lb/>succeed better to reproduce experimental column behaviour may simply be that they incorporate more <lb/>degrees of freedom than classical transport models. As stressed by these authors, more degrees of <lb/>freedom do not necessary induce a better model. <lb/>5. Conclusions <lb/>This paper presents the results of intermediate scale tracer experiments carried out using a model <lb/>heterogeneous porous medium with a variable length. The periodic character of the medium allows the <lb/>stationarity of the medium properties to be preserved. The large number of replicates (44 experiments <lb/>for 4 different column lengths) allows sampling artefacts to be minimized and reliable statistics to be <lb/>derived. A confidence interval for the unit transfer function of a single period of the model medium is <lb/>derived from a Laplace transform analysis. <lb/>In the light of this work, the answers to questions (Q1-6) raised in the Introduction are the following. <lb/>(A1) No clear scaling trend can be identified for the dispersion coefficient within the range of <lb/>experimental uncertainty for the present MHPM. <lb/>(A2) Given the strong individual variability observed from one replicate to another, sampling <lb/>artefacts may lead to wrongly conclude that the dispersion coefficient is scale-dependent. <lb/>(A3) There exists a model with scale-independent parameters that can provide a correct description of <lb/>the solute transfer in the MHPM from N = 3 to N = 15. <lb/>(A4) This model is not the AD model, because it does not allow the experimental breakthrough <lb/>curves to be reproduced accurately within the range of the experimental uncertainty. <lb/>(A5) The AD model can be deemed to provide an accurate description of the present MHPM after the <lb/>solute has been transported over at least 10 (and most probably 20) periods. The size of the <lb/>REV for this MHPM is thus between 10 and 20 MHPM periods. <lb/>(A6) The MI and CTRW models will fail to reproduce the small-time and short-distance <lb/>experimental behaviour of the MHPM because of the second-order derivative used in the <lb/>modelling of dispersion. <lb/>We should like to stress the strong variability of the experimental results, even in the case of the <lb/>present artificial MHPM, that was intentionally made strictly periodic. This should make modellers <lb/>extremely cautious when dealing with natural media, the geometry of which is often poorly known and <lb/>does not exhibit the degree of determinism of the present MHPM. This makes the systematic <lb/>replication of breakthrough experiments indispensable in seeking reliable conclusions on scaling <lb/>effects, as well as in model calibration attempts. It is a useful reality check of the assumptions of <lb/>stationarity and ergodicity (Kulasiri and Verwoerd, 2002) of the AD model. From a more general <lb/>perspective, one might also question the relevance of investigating the scaling behaviour of the AD <lb/>model for spatial scales where it is invalid. This questioning also holds for alternate models such as <lb/>anomalous transport models. <lb/>Lastly, the present work shows the usefulness of a high resolution sampling in analyzing the MHPM <lb/>transfer functions (each of the breakthrough curves used in this study is made of 500 to 1500 records). <lb/>Further research focuses on (i) an experimental design from which the boundary effects arising from <lb/>the inlet distribution is absent, which would allow the unit response r to be derived directly for a single <lb/>column, (ii) carrying out series of experiments at identical N for several discharge values, so as to <lb/>analyze the dependence of the dispersion coefficient on the flow velocity, and (iii) developing and <lb/>applying alternative transport models (among which variations of the multirate model) to better <lb/>3 <lb/>simulate the ISE using scale-independent parameters. The present experiments clearly indicate that <lb/>such a model exists. However, it should most probably not be based on a Fickian description of <lb/>5 <lb/>dispersion. <lb/>6 <lb/></body>
