Weight change <lb/>was calculated using the difference between the baseline weight and the weight at health <lb/>screening four years prior to the baseline. The occurrence of newly-diagnosed ischemic <lb/>stroke was observed until the end of 2015. We categorized the study population according <lb/>to weight change and performed multivariable analysis to compare the risk. <lb/>Results <lb/>Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 113,591 subjects. The crude incidence rates of <lb/>ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years according to the change in body weight were 3.059, <lb/>1.906, and 1.491 in the &lt;-5%, ±5%, and �+5% groups, respectively. After adjusting all vari-<lb/>ables, the hazard ratio (HR) of ischemic stroke was higher in subjects who underwent weight <lb/>loss (HR 1.152) or weight gain (HR 1.087) than in those who maintained their weight.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Obesity is steadily increasing worldwide and is a serious problem associated with approxi-<lb/>mately 3.5 million deaths [1]. In 2013, 10.3 million cases of stroke occurred, of which two-<lb/>thirds were ischemic strokes [2]. <lb/>The association between overweight and the risk of ischemic stroke is well known [3], and <lb/>overweight and obesity are independently associated with a gradual increase in ischemic stroke <lb/>risk [4]. In addition, the major risk factors for stroke are also closely linked to obesity [5]. <lb/>Thus, the recent guideline published by the American Stroke Association recommends weight <lb/>reduction for overweight or obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 25 kg/m 2 <lb/>or greater for the primary prevention of ischemic stroke [6]. <lb/>However, the effect of weight change on ischemic stroke risk remains controversial. Weight <lb/>gain is known to increase the risk of ischemic stroke [7], and weight loss, through maintaining <lb/>a negative energy balance, reduces the risk [8,9]. However, in an observational study based on <lb/>the Framingham study participants, cardiovascular mortality was increased for both men and <lb/>women who lost weight compared to those who maintained their weight [10]. Other studies <lb/>on middle-aged participants also showed higher cardiovascular mortality in the case of losing <lb/>weight [11,12]. Furthermore, studies have shown an increased risk of ischemic stroke in weight <lb/>loss [13,14]. However, some controversies remain regarding whether weight gain or loss could <lb/>affect the occurrence of ischemic stroke. <lb/>Therefore, we investigated the relationship between weight change and the incidence and <lb/>risk of ischemic stroke to clarify its relevance by using the Korean Nationwide Health Screen-<lb/>ing Database. We hypothesized that the risk of ischemic stroke is greater for those who gained <lb/>or lost weight than for those who maintained their weight. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Korean nationwide health screening database <lb/>The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) organized by the Korean government provides <lb/>health insurance services for more than 97% of Koreans. The demographic information of <lb/>beneficiaries such as disease codes, medical examinations, and claims for treatment are secured <lb/>by the NHIS. Beneficiaries of the NHIS older than 40 years and insured workers older than 20 <lb/>years undergo annual or biennial health screening supported by the NHIS. The health screen-<lb/>ing database includes information on health behaviors, self-questionnaires, anthropometric <lb/>measurements, and laboratory findings; the demographic information of beneficiaries was <lb/>combined to constitute a nationwide population-based cohort [15]. All researchers had access <lb/>to the database without restrictions. <lb/></body>

			<body>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kangbuk Samsung Hos-<lb/>pital (approval number: KBS12089), and authorized by the NHIS (research number NHIS-<lb/>2017-1-201). All data were fully anonymized before we accessed them and IRB of Kangbuk <lb/>Samsung Hospital waived the requirement for informed consent. <lb/>Study population <lb/>Our study involved 23,503,802 Koreans aged �20 years who underwent the health screening <lb/>more than once, from 2009 to 2012. If the participants received multiple health screenings dur-<lb/>ing that period, the first health checkup was set as the baseline. <lb/>We defined weight change as the difference between the baseline weight of the participants <lb/>and their weight four years earlier by checking health screening records four years prior to the <lb/>baseline. Therefore, participants without a health screening record from four years prior to the <lb/>baseline were not eligible for the study (n = 11,827,274) (Fig 1).

In addition, people who had a history of cancer <lb/>(n = 248,397) were also excluded because cancer is a key cause of unintentional weight loss. <lb/>Finally, 11,084,683 participants were enrolled in our study (Fig 1). <lb/>Baseline assessments <lb/>Basic information and health-related behaviors, including smoking (never or current), drink-<lb/>ing alcohol (none or heavy; more than 30 g per day), and regular physical activity (vigorous <lb/>exercise more than three days per week or moderate exercise more than five days per week), <lb/>were collected with standardized health screening questionnaires. All data of BMI and body <lb/>weight were measured by trained examiners. Blood pressure was measured using a blood pres-<lb/>sure monitor after five minutes of rest, and all blood tests were performed after eight hours of <lb/>overnight fasting. <lb/>Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level �126 mg/dL (�7 mmol/L) or the pres-<lb/>ence of one or more claims per year for anti-hyperglycemic medications with ICD-10 code <lb/>E10-14. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure �140 mmHg and diastolic blood <lb/>pressure �90 mmHg or the presence of one or more claims per year for anti-hypertensive <lb/>medications with ICD-10 code I10-I15. Dyslipidemia was defined as total cholesterol levels <lb/>�240 mg/dL (�6.21 mmol/L) according to the 2015 Korean Guidelines for the Management <lb/>of Dyslipidemia or the presence of one or more claims per year for anti-hyperlipidemic medi-<lb/>cations with ICD-10 code E78 [16]. <lb/>Study design and outcomes <lb/>We defined the weight maintenance group as weight change within ±5% and categorized the <lb/>study participants into three and eight groups according to weight change by 5% intervals [11,12]. <lb/>The primary endpoint was the occurrence of first ischemic stroke, defined as the event-<lb/>related hospitalization along with the ICD-10 code I63 or I64 and the presence of a claim for <lb/>computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This outcome was observed by check-<lb/>ing the NHIS database until the end of 2015. <lb/>In addition, we stratified the BMI at baseline and the BMI four years prior to the baseline <lb/>into five levels according to the Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Korean Society for the <lb/>Study of Obesity [17] and investigated how the risk of stroke differed according to the changes <lb/>in BMI over four years: BMI level 1, BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 ; BMI level 2, 18.5� BMI &lt; 3.0 kg/m 2 ; <lb/>BMI level 3, 23.0� BMI &lt;25.0 kg/m 2 ; BMI level 4, 25.0� BMI &lt;30.0 kg/m 2 ; BMI level 5, BMI <lb/>�30.0 kg/m 2 . <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data of baseline characteristics presented as con-<lb/>tinuous variables, while chi-square tests were used for the analysis of categorical variables. The <lb/>incidence rate (IR) was defined as the prevalence of the outcome per 1000 person-years. If fol-<lb/>low-up was lost due to death, the period of observation until that time was included in the <lb/>total follow-up duration. The risk of ischemic stroke according to weight change was analyzed <lb/>using Cox regression to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We <lb/>compared the HRs of weight change groups using the group that maintained initial weight as a <lb/>reference. To identify independent relationships, we performed further adjustments including <lb/>variables that were associated with weight change and ischemic stroke. The confounding vari-<lb/>ables to be included in multivariate analysis were the variables that affected the outcome of the <lb/>model. As the size of the total study population was huge, all variables showed significant <lb/></body>

			<body>differences according to the presence or absence of the outcome. Therefore, we selected the <lb/>variables considering clinical significance and multicollinearity. The HRs for ischemic stroke <lb/>in subgroups divided according to various risk factors related with weight change were ana-<lb/>lyzed by Cox regression analyses with P for interaction between the subgroups. Diabetes, <lb/>hypertension and dyslipidemia were categorized as the mediators, not confounding variables. <lb/>We performed subgroup analyses according to the presence or absence of these mediators, <lb/>instead of including them in the model. <lb/>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, <lb/>USA). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <lb/>Results <lb/>Baseline characteristics of the participants <lb/>Of the 11,084,683 participants (mean age 49.7±13.5 years, range 20-114), 1,528,869 people lost <lb/>more than 5% of their weight, 7,341,936 people maintained their weight within ±5% of the ini-<lb/>tial measurement, and 2,213,878 people gained weight by more than 5% (Table 1). The weight <lb/>loss group had a higher proportion of women, participants aged �60 years, non-smokers, reg-<lb/>ular physical activity, low income, no abdominal obesity, pre-BMI &gt;25 kg/m 2 , and a higher <lb/>prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive <lb/>pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease than the weight gain group. <lb/>Incidence and HRs of ischemic stroke <lb/>From 2009 to the end of 2015, 113,591 participants (approximately 1.02% of the total) were <lb/>newly diagnosed with ischemic stroke. The mean follow-up period of participants was 5.18 <lb/>±1.18 years, and the median time to ischemic stroke development was 2.81 years. <lb/>The crude IRs of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years was 3.06 (&lt;-5%), 1.91 (±5%), and <lb/>1.49 (�+5%) for the entire population (Table 2). A larger adjusted IR (adjusted for age and <lb/>sex) and HR after adjusting for age and sex (Model 1) were confirmed for the weight gain <lb/>group (adjusted IR 0.96; HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.12) than for the weight maintenance group <lb/>(adjusted IR 0.87; HR 1.000, reference), contrary to the results of the crude IR. After adjusted <lb/>analyses considering all variables (Model 3), the HRs of ischemic stroke were higher in partici-<lb/>pants who underwent weight loss (&lt;-5%) (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19-1.22) or weight gain (�+5%) <lb/>(HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.08) than in those who maintained their weight. When these analyses <lb/>were performed in subgroups of mediators, that is, presence or absence of diabetes, hyperten-<lb/>sion or dyslipidemia, similar results were observed, and all mediators showed interaction with <lb/>the association between weight change and ischemic stroke (S1 Table). <lb/>The results according to sex were similar for the entire study group (Table 2). In subgroup <lb/>analyses that could affect the incidence of ischemic stroke, age of 60 years or older, presence of <lb/>ischemic heart disease, smoking status and physical activity showed interaction with the asso-<lb/>ciation between weight change and ischemic stroke (S2 Table). <lb/>After the analyses of the eight groups divided by 5% intervals (Fig 2), the risk showed a U-<lb/>shaped curve with those who maintained their weight within ±5% showing the lowest risk; the <lb/>risk gradually increased as weight was lost or gained in the entire population. <lb/>When the analyses were performed separately according to ICD-10 codes I63 or I64, similar <lb/>trends were observed, although absolute risk was higher in those with I63 than in those with <lb/>I64 due to differences in the absolute number of events (S3 Table). <lb/>When similar analyses were performed in subgroups stratified by the presence and absence <lb/>of three diseases that could affect weight (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic <lb/>heart disease, and chronic kidney disease), the results were similar (S4 Table). <lb/></body>

			<body>Comparison of the risk for ischemic stroke according to the interval <lb/>changes in BMI <lb/>The risk was analyzed according to the changes in BMI between baseline and four years prior <lb/>to baseline with the reference group being those who maintained their BMI level (Table 3). <lb/>The proportion of participants in low BMI levels decreased and those in high BMI levels <lb/>increased after four years (S5 Table). Regardless of BMI levels four years prior to the baseline, <lb/>the lowest risk was always observed in the group who maintained BMI after adjusting for all <lb/>variables. The only exceptions were those with a BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 and post 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 <lb/>four years prior to baseline (Table 3). <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Discussion <lb/>In this study of more than ten million Korean adults, nearly a quarter of the entire population, <lb/>we report that the risk of ischemic stroke gradually increased in those who lost or gained more <lb/>than 5% of their weight after adjustment for confounders compared to those who maintained <lb/>their weight in the mean follow-up period of five years.

			<body>In a previous study in Asian men who were not obese on average [18], long-term weight <lb/>loss from a young age had the effect of lowering the incidence of coronary heart disease <lb/>(CHD), despite an increased risk for CHD in middle-aged individuals with short-term weight <lb/>loss over six years. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study demonstrated the different <lb/>effects of long-term (within approximately 30 years) and short-term (within three years) <lb/>weight loss on cardiovascular disease (CVD) [13]. In our study which assessed a relatively <lb/>short-term change in body weight over a 4-year period, the immediate risk of ischemic stroke <lb/>was increased after weight loss, similar to the above mentioned results.

			<body>more CVD-related covariates than the above Japanese study did not show a significant differ-<lb/>ence between men and women; both sexes had a greater risk of ischemic stroke with weight <lb/>loss than with the maintenance or gain of weight. In addition, our study was designed for a <lb/>homogenous population of Korean adults; therefore, bias related to sex and age-specific timing <lb/>of enrollment would be less than for previous studies. <lb/>In a study that assessed CVD-related prognoses due to differences in the mechanism of <lb/>weight loss, it was found that the effects of intentional and unintentional weight loss might be <lb/>different [19]. Intentional weight reduction, such as decreasing calorie intake and increasing <lb/>physical activity, had a positive effect on CVD risk, and the benefit increased with increased <lb/>weight loss, especially in obese Caucasian women [7,20,21]. Nevertheless, whether intentional <lb/>or unintentional, weight loss had a negative effect on the CVD outcome in older Caucasian <lb/>men [22]. Additionally, increased CVD mortality was observed in overweight middle-aged <lb/>Caucasian women with intentional weight loss, regardless of obesity-related health problems <lb/>[11]. Because of our study design, we were unable to distinguish clearly between intentional <lb/>and unintentional weight loss and did not get information about diet. However, in the study <lb/>by Yaari et al., both voluntary and involuntary weight loss, including diet, appeared to increase <lb/>CVD mortality [12]. In addition, considering that the calibration of fitness is of great impor-<lb/>tance in examining the relationship between obesity and CVD outcomes, adjusting for exercise <lb/>is important in interpreting the risk [23,24]. We performed an additional adjustment involving <lb/>exercise as a variable, and a subgroup analysis according to regular physical activity was also <lb/>performed. The risk of ischemic stroke further increased as the weight decreased regardless of <lb/>exercise. Therefore, we suggest that weight loss could have a negative effect on the risk of ische-<lb/>mic stroke, independent of intentionality. <lb/>Presumably, a loss of lean body mass with frailty increased the risk of ischemic stroke in <lb/>our subjects. Previously, a study showed an increase in mortality in relatively healthy over-<lb/>weight subjects despite intentional weight loss, indicating the adverse effects of weight loss <lb/>regardless of intentionality on human health. In addition, frail health was associated with ath-<lb/>erosclerosis and subclinical CVD risk [25,26]. In our study, the weight loss group contained a <lb/>higher proportion of elderly subjects as well as underlying diseases associated with frailty, such <lb/>as ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease. <lb/>In a study by Look AHEAD researchers, two-thirds of participants with a moderate to large <lb/>intentional weight loss (more than 3%) showed a partial or whole weight regain [21]. It was <lb/>reported that weight regain after diet-induced intentional weight loss weakened any cardiovas-<lb/>cular benefits obtained by weight loss [27]. <lb/>Interestingly, a recent study suggested that body-weight variability serves as an independent <lb/>risk factor for CVD, and the level of this risk increased with increasing body weight fluctuation <lb/>[28]. Although we could not confirm the detailed individual variability in weight, these find-<lb/>ings might be helpful in interpreting the results of our study, which were that a larger weight <lb/>loss had a greater impact on the risk of ischemic stroke. <lb/>Our study has several limitations. First, diet is an important factor in assessing the inten-<lb/>tionality of weight change, and our observational study using existing data without diet infor-<lb/>mation could lower the accuracy of our findings. For decades, Korean adults have been <lb/>consuming less energy compared to their increasing energy intake, and the proportion of fat <lb/>intake is also increasing [29]. Bearing this in mind, diet would have contributed proportionally <lb/>more to weight gain in our study population. Second, we only studied the first diagnosed <lb/>ischemic stroke, not other types of stroke such as hemorrhagic or recurrent stroke. However, <lb/>in Korea, most strokes (approximately 60% of the total) were ischemic in nature [30]. More <lb/>than 70% of stroke patients experienced their first attacks, suggesting that primary prevention <lb/>plays an important role in stroke prevention [31]. Third, there was no washout period from <lb/></body>

			<body>enrollment to the onset of ischemic stroke, and this could be a problem in establishing a causal <lb/>relationship. However, most (approximately 75%, data not shown) participants identified as <lb/>having had an ischemic stroke were enrolled in 2009 and 2010, and the incidence in those <lb/>two years was only 10% within the entire study period. Fourth, only those with a health screen-<lb/>ing record from four years prior to the baseline were eligible for the study; therefore, selection <lb/>bias cannot be ruled out. Fifth, the ischemic stroke risk was lower in the smoking subgroup <lb/>than in non-smokers, contrary to what is known about smoking as a risk factor for ischemic <lb/>stroke. This may be due to the high percentage of non-smokers in the weight loss group, or a <lb/>misinterpretation of the bias regarding causality in the study population. Sixth, atrial fibrilla-<lb/>tion, a major risk factor for embolic stroke was not included as a covariate. Finally, many meta-<lb/>bolic characteristics of the participants at baseline showed big differences compared to those <lb/>from four years prior, although we made attempts to adjust the covariates that could confound <lb/>the results in any way. As fluctuations in body weight had deleterious effects and this was <lb/>affected by multiple factors, statistical adjustments for these factors cannot lessen this limita-<lb/>tion [32]. However, the finding that large changes in body weight over a 4-year period had <lb/>deleterious effects on stroke development is valuable for the prevention of stroke in this <lb/>population. <lb/>To our knowledge, this is the first study worldwide that confirms the relationship between <lb/>weight change and ischemic stroke based on a large, nationwide population-based cohort <lb/>comprising more than ten million individuals. The risk of a first ischemic stroke was observed <lb/>to be lowest in the group that maintained their weight, and it gradually increased in those who <lb/>experienced a weight loss or gain of more than 5% within four years. Furthermore, weight loss <lb/>had a greater impact on ischemic stroke than weight gain after adjusting for confounders. It is <lb/>important to keep this increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with weight change in <lb/>mind and to identify the cause of weight change to facilitate appropriate action in clinical prac-<lb/>tice. Further follow-up studies are required to identify the long-term and casual relationships <lb/>between weight change and ischemic stroke. <lb/></body>
