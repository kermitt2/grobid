			<body>O xindole alkaloids are an important group of mono-<lb/>terpene alkaloids with spirocyclic oxindole nuclei and are <lb/>often associated with significant pharmacological activity. 1,2 <lb/>Among these, spiro-bridged oxindole frameworks are core <lb/>structures widely encountered in many natural products <lb/>(Figure 1). For example, chitsenine I and alkaloid II exhibit <lb/>short-lived inhibitory activity in vivo of ganglionic transmission <lb/>in both rats and rabbits. 3 Spiro-bridged oxindole III, prepared <lb/>by Sakai and co-workers as an analogue of II, has been <lb/>employed in a formulation known to inhibit ulcers. 4 On the <lb/>other hand, gelsemine IV is a spiro-bridged oxindole alkaloid <lb/>isolated from flowering plants of the genus Gelsemium and <lb/>exhibited potent and specific antinociception in chronic pain <lb/>by acting at the three spinal glycine receptors. 5 <lb/>The combinatorial pharmacophore strategy has played a <lb/>central role in the search of leading compounds for new drug <lb/>development. 6 Oxindole, 7 indanone, 8 and amide 9 fragments <lb/>are three well-known pharmacophores and are found in various <lb/>natural and bioactive molecules (Figure 2). However, most <lb/>established protocols furnish the products containing only <lb/>oxindole and indanone pharmacophores in spiro-fused <lb/>heterocyclic systems. 10 To the best of our knowledge, there <lb/>have been no reports on the construction of compounds <lb/>combining all of them in one spiro-bridged heterocyclic <lb/>molecule, which may potentially have biological activities. <lb/>Hence, it is highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic <lb/></body>

			<body>procedures for the synthesis of spiro-bridged heterocyclic <lb/>compounds containing these three potential pharmacophores. <lb/>Isatylidene-malononitriles, which are a class of α,α-<lb/>dicyanoolefins, have been widely employed as versatile <lb/>acceptors or dienophiles in various reactions. 11 In the past <lb/>few years, significant progress has been made in the <lb/>development of organocatalyzed annulation reactions using <lb/>isatylidene-malononitriles as electrophiles by a number of <lb/>publications in the literature. 12 In this regard, the annulation <lb/>reactions are known to take place exclusively at the α position <lb/>first by nucleophilic addition, and then electrophilic sites are <lb/>attacked from the β position (Scheme 1a, path A). In contrast, <lb/>the annulation reactions take place exclusively at the β position <lb/>first by nucleophilic addition, and then electrophilic sites are <lb/>attacked from the α position, which remains rare (Scheme 1a, <lb/>path B). Recently, Namboothiri and co-workers reported a <lb/>vinylogous Michael addition of nitroalkylideneoxindoles to <lb/>isatylidene-malononitriles in the regioselective synthesis of <lb/>dispirocyclopentylbisoxindoles. 13 To the best of our knowl-<lb/>edge, this is the only example of nucleophilic addition to <lb/>isatylidene-malononitriles at the β position first. Hence, <lb/>inspired by the work mentioned above, we envisioned that <lb/>2-ethylidene 1,3-indandiones 2 will also proceed via vinylogous <lb/>Michael addition at the β position of isatylidene-malononitriles <lb/>1 to the construction of spirooxindoles with an indandione <lb/>moiety. However, we found that the obtained products <lb/>contained amide, indanone, and oxindole moieties. Moreover, <lb/>we discovered that the amide group formed via a [1,3]-O-to-N <lb/>rearrangement of allylic imidates A. 14 It is interesting because <lb/>this type of rearrangement usually has been accomplished in <lb/>the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. 15 The base-catalyzed <lb/>[1,3]-O-to-N rearrangement is underexplored. Continuing our <lb/>efforts to develop efficient vinylogous reactions with 2-<lb/>ethylidene indane-1,3-diones, 16 we herein report the successful <lb/>execution of an unusual cascade reaction to establish unique <lb/>spiro-bridged heterocyclic compounds containing amide, <lb/>indanone, and oxindole moieties. <lb/>At the outset of the investigation, the reaction between 2-<lb/>ethylidene 1,3-indandione 1a and isatylidene-malononitrile 2a <lb/>was employed as the model reaction for optimization (Table <lb/>1). First, several inorganic bases were evaluated in CH 2 Cl 2 , and <lb/>all of them yielded moderate results (entries 1-3). <lb/>Subsequently, various organic bases were used to catalyze the <lb/>reaction. However, both the yield and diastereoselectivity were <lb/>lower than those of inorganic bases (entries 4-6). To our <lb/>delight, quinine, which forms one hydrogen bond between <lb/>reactants, delivered the product with the highest yield and <lb/>good diastereoselectivity (entry 7). The investigations of <lb/>various solvents showed that THF gave a similar diaster-<lb/>eoselectivity and a better product yield (entries 8-11). <lb/>Upon treatment of the reaction mixture with different <lb/>concentrations, 0.1 M was identified as the best concentration <lb/>to promote diastereoselectivity with a slightly increased yield <lb/>(entries 12-14). Reducing the amount of base resulted in a <lb/>decreased yield (entry 15). Finally, the optimal conditions <lb/>were selected by conducting the reaction at room temperature <lb/>in THF with 20 mol % quinine at a substrate concentration of <lb/>0.1 M (entry 13). <lb/>With the optimal conditions established, we next examined <lb/>the scope of various isatylidene-malononitriles 1 and 2-<lb/>ethylidene 1,3-indandiones 2. As depicted in Scheme 2, all <lb/>reactions proceeded well under the described conditions, <lb/>affording the desired products in moderate to high isolated <lb/>yields with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. First, the <lb/>positions and electronic properties of isatin substituents were <lb/>tested. <lb/>Notably, the 5-F-and 7-F-substituted isatylidene-malononi-<lb/>triles gave lower yields of products 3b (69%) and 3j (54%), <lb/>respectively. The lower reactivity of fluoro-substituted <lb/>isatylidene-malononitriles was observed. It is possible that <lb/>the fluorine atom generates hydrogen bonding with the catalyst <lb/>and retards the turnover efficiency of the catalyst. <lb/>Scheme 1.

			<body>Indandione 2a could react with electron-rich and electron-<lb/>deficient isatylidene-malononitriles and provided products 3c-<lb/>i in high yields (80-90%) with high diastereoselectivity <lb/>(&gt;20:1). The scale-up reaction for 1h and 2a also proceeded <lb/>smoothly to give product 3h in 74% isolated yield and &gt;20:1 <lb/>dr. This result is also similar to the small-scale reaction. <lb/>Subsequent investigations then focused on the different aryl <lb/>substitutions on 2-ethylidene 1,3-indandiones 2. In all cases, <lb/>the reactions proceeded well, affording 3k-q in good to high <lb/>yields (68-91%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20:1 dr). <lb/>Furthermore, the effect of protecting groups of isatylidene-<lb/>malononitriles 1 was also investigated, leading to the formation <lb/>of products 3r-3v with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1). <lb/>However, complex mixtures were observed without protection <lb/>or when the protecting group was replaced with an electron-<lb/>withdrawing group (Boc) (3w and 3x). The structure of 3 was <lb/>confirmed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 3f <lb/>(CCDC 2370395). 17 <lb/>We then carried out the functionalization of product 3h. <lb/>Treatment of 3h with Boc 2 O under basic conditions resulted in <lb/>the protection of amide and ketone groups, leading to the <lb/>formation of di-Boc-protected product 4 in 75% reaction yield <lb/>(Scheme 3a). The protection of ketone was unexpected, and it <lb/>might be from the deprotonation of the γ position of the <lb/>ketone by a base. To prove this, we then performed a <lb/>deuterium labeling study under basic conditions and obtained <lb/>product 3h-d 2 in 69% yield with 76% deuterium labeling <lb/>(Scheme 3b). <lb/>On the basis of previous work 12,13 and a deuterium labeling <lb/>study (Scheme 3b), a plausible catalytic cycle for the tertiary <lb/>amine-catalyzed reaction is proposed in Scheme 4.

			<body>acidic hydrogen of 2-ethylidene 1,3-indandione 2a is <lb/>deprotonated by the catalyst to generate Int-1. Furthermore, <lb/>Int-1 undergoes Michael addition to the β position of <lb/>electrophile 1a, forming intermediate Int-2. Next, conjugated <lb/>electrons attack the carbonyl group of indandione to form Int-<lb/>3. The 1,2-addition of alkoxide to nitrile afforded imidate Int-4 <lb/>after protonation. Finally, the deprotonation of the γ position <lb/>of ketone by a base triggered a [1,3]-O-to-N rearrangement of <lb/>allylic imidate Int-4 and delivered product 3a. <lb/>To gain further mechanistic insights into the process, we <lb/>conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations <lb/>performed at the M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP/SMD(THF)// <lb/>B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/IEFPCM(THF) theoretical level. <lb/>In the catalytic cycles listed in Scheme 4, a comprehensive <lb/>depiction of the energy profiles for this cascade reaction is <lb/>provided in Figure 3. The structure of the catalyst was <lb/>simplified to DABCO for the following DFT calculation. The <lb/>energy of TS2, where the nucleophile adds to the β position of <lb/>1a, is lower than the energy of the nucleophile addition at the <lb/>α position of 1a (TS1). Hence, the vinylogous Michael <lb/>addition of 1,3-indandione 1a at the β position of 1a is <lb/>preferred. Enolate Int-6, which originates from the addition of <lb/>a nucleophile to the β position of 1a, then attacks the carbonyl <lb/>group of indandione with a barrier of 9.5 kcal mol -1 . The 1,2-<lb/>addition of alkoxide to nitrile afforded imidate Int-8 after <lb/>protonation. Although the deprotonation of the γ position of <lb/>ketone by a base has a higher energy barrier (14.8 kcal mol -1 ), <lb/>the barrier for the rearrangement of allylic imidate Int-9 to <lb/>amide anion Int-10 is lower than that of the deprotonation <lb/>step (10.9 kcal mol -1 ). The intramolecular aza-Michael <lb/>addition to enone to form product 3a suffers a high barrier <lb/>of 24.8 kcal mol -1 due to steric hindrance. However, product <lb/>3a is exothermically formed by 39.2 kcal mol -1 , indicating the <lb/>formation of 3a is thermodynamically favorable. <lb/>The asymmetric version of this cascade reaction was also <lb/>investigated. Preliminary screening of chiral organocatalysts <lb/>was conducted in CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. The <lb/>enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity were moderate (see <lb/>the Supporting Information for more details). We have not <lb/>obtained satisfactory results so far. <lb/>In summary, we have developed an organocatalytic cascade <lb/>reaction of 2-ethylidene 1,3-indandiones 2 and isatylidene-<lb/>malononitriles 1 using quinine as the catalyst. The unexpected <lb/>vinylogous Michael addition at the β position of isatylidene-<lb/>malononitriles, followed by aldol cyclization, 1,2-addition of <lb/>alkoxide to nitrile, and [1,3]-O-to-N rearrangement, led to the <lb/>generation of unique spiro-bridged heterocyclic compounds <lb/>containing amide, indanone, and oxindole moieties in good to <lb/>excellent yields with high diastereoselectivities. The DFT <lb/>calculations were conducted to demonstrate why the vinyl-<lb/>ogous Michael addition occurred at the β position of the <lb/>isatylidene-malononitriles. <lb/>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>All commercially available reagents were used without further <lb/>purification unless otherwise stated. All of the reaction solvents <lb/>were purified before use. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H <lb/>NMR) spectra were recorded on a commercial instrument at 400 <lb/>MHz. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13 C{ 1 H} NMR) <lb/>spectra were recorded at 100 MHz. The proton signal for a residual <lb/>nondeuterated solvent (δ 7.26 for CHCl 3 ) was used as an internal <lb/>reference for 1 H NMR spectra. For 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra, chemical <lb/>shifts are reported relative to the δ 77.0 resonance of CHCl 3 . <lb/>Coupling constants are reported in hertz. Melting points were <lb/>determined on a BUCHI B-545 melting point apparatus and were <lb/>uncorrected. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a <lb/>Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. The <lb/>single crystal was measured by a Bruker D8 VENTURE X-ray single-<lb/>crystal diffractometer. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) <lb/>was performed on silica gel 60 F254 precoated plates with <lb/>visualization under UV light. Column chromatography was generally <lb/>performed using 40-63 μm (230-400 mesh) silica gel, typically using <lb/>a 50-100:1 weight ratio of silica gel to the crude product. Isatylidene-<lb/>malononitriles 1 and spiroindane-1,3-diones 2 were prepared <lb/>according to known procedures. 18,19 <lb/>General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 3. To a <lb/>7 mL vial equipped with a stirring bar were added 1 (0.10 mmol, 1 <lb/>equiv), 2 (0.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and quinine (20 mol %). Then, 1.0 <lb/>mL of THF was added to the mixture, and the resulting reaction <lb/>mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 48 h. After <lb/>completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the solvent was <lb/>removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was <lb/>purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a hexane/ethyl <lb/>acetate eluent at 7:1 to 5:1 to 3:1 to afford 3. <lb/>Figure 3.
