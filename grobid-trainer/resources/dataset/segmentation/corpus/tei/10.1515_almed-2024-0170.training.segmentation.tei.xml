These procedures aim not <lb/>only to ensure the efficacy and safety of operations but also to <lb/>establish a clear chain of responsibility. They align with <lb/>established best practices. Certification grants formal authori-<lb/>zation to qualified individuals to perform specific tasks. For <lb/>new hires, a comprehensive training program is designed <lb/>to facilitate their integration and empower them from the <lb/>onset. We propose training objectives structured around a <lb/>competency-based approach, highlighting objective evaluation <lb/>criteria applicable in real-world practical settings. These <lb/>training objectives address critical aspects such as the handling <lb/>of hazardous substances, weighing and mixing of powders, and <lb/>capsule filling. They also emphasize the importance of docu-<lb/>mentation and traceability. Specialized preparations and tools <lb/>are offered to facilitate the assessment of learning outcomes. <lb/>Keywords: education; continuous learning; drug com-<lb/>pounding; pharmaceutical technology; capsules <lb/></front>

        <body>Introduction and scope <lb/>The manual compounding of capsules in pharmacy is a <lb/>multifaceted process that often requires careful handling of <lb/>potentially hazardous substances. This procedure generally <lb/>begins with the exact weighing and volume measurement of <lb/>various powders to ensure consistent dosage levels. Once <lb/>accurately measured, these powders are meticulously mixed <lb/>to create a uniform blend, a crucial step before they are used <lb/>to fill the capsules. The traceability of the operations carried <lb/>out is an important aspect of this process, and it is essential to <lb/>document any nonconformity or problems encountered <lb/>throughout the procedure so that any difficulties can be re-<lb/>ported. These measures should help to strengthen quality <lb/>assurance, facilitate accountability, and encourage contin-<lb/>uous improvement of the process. Therefore, production of <lb/>capsules in pharmacies requires appropriately trained and <lb/>authorized personnel to carry out these tasks. This training <lb/></body>

        <body>and authorization of staff are crucial components of a quality <lb/>system and are essential prerequisites for ensuring optimal <lb/>quality control. This validation of skills and knowledge is also <lb/>an essential element when delegating technical tasks. <lb/>The aim of this document is to provide comprehensive <lb/>guidelines describing the essential training objectives and <lb/>staff authorization requirements for the manual prepara-<lb/>tion of capsules in pharmacies. <lb/>Key considerations <lb/>As effective training is a critical part of quality assurance in a <lb/>compounding process, comprehensive capsule compounding <lb/>training, including the knowledge and skills required to <lb/>perform the steps of weighing raw materials, measuring <lb/>apparent volumes, mixing, and distributing powders, should be <lb/>designed, and delivered to employees. This training program <lb/>shall be documented and designed to allow validation of all, or <lb/>part of the achievements related to the target process. The <lb/>approval of training protocols and the training and authori-<lb/>zation of personnel must be carried out by an authorized <lb/>pharmacist and approved by the pharmacist in charge of the <lb/>production. <lb/>Learners should also be familiarized with local best <lb/>practices for compounding and the applicable regulations. <lb/>These local guidelines, often setting broad quality standards, <lb/>serve as essential prerequisites and compliance with these <lb/>standards is crucial to ensure the quality and safety in <lb/>capsule compounding. <lb/>Assessment of knowledge and skills <lb/>Pharmacists should make the purposes of training explicit, <lb/>encompassing knowledge, know-how, and attitudes, by <lb/>formalizing the didactic contract between learners and <lb/>instructors. Both objective-based and competence-based <lb/>approaches could be used to build the training program <lb/>and contribute to comprehensive learning. The former <lb/>approach ensures a thorough acquisition of domain-specific <lb/>knowledge, while the latter prioritizes the development of <lb/>skills pertinent to the practical application (1). <lb/>It&apos;s crucial that the assessments used for certification <lb/>predominantly evaluate the demonstration of skills within <lb/>real-world professional contexts, rather than primarily relying <lb/>on traditional written exams that focus on knowledge acqui-<lb/>sition. While knowledge can be evaluated through e-learning <lb/>methods and a variety of questionnaires, either in-person or <lb/>online, it&apos;s advisable to avoid the use of indexed answers as <lb/>they may not adequately gauge a student&apos;s understanding. <lb/>Competence can be verified using practical methodologies such <lb/>as direct observation, simulations, case studies, and problem-<lb/>solving exercises. The assessments should accurately reflect the <lb/>skills acquired, those being developed, and those yet to be <lb/>mastered. This way, subsequent steps can be tailored appro-<lb/>priately, and the evaluations should occur on multiple occa-<lb/>sions to track progress effectively. <lb/>Main topics and training objectives <lb/>Essential principles and procedures in <lb/>working areas <lb/>Within the scope of pharmaceutical production, learners are <lb/>required to grasp vital principles and methodologies con-<lb/>cerning workplace hygiene and the prevention of contami-<lb/>nation as it may impact both quality and security (2). This <lb/>encompasses a thorough understanding and mitigation of <lb/>cross-contamination risks, ensuring that the production line <lb/>is empty and adhering to the &apos;forward flow&apos; principle for the <lb/>flow of materials. Finally, cleaning is an integral part of this <lb/>process and plays a major role in ensuring that the envi-<lb/>ronment and the product are free from contamination. <lb/>Mastery of cleaning and biocleaning procedures is funda-<lb/>mental to preserving product quality and maintaining a safe <lb/>operating environment (3). In light of these considerations, <lb/>the following points should be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should understand the concept of cross-<lb/>contamination, its potential sources in the pharmaceu-<lb/>tical production process, and its impact on product quality <lb/>and safety. They should develop skills to identify risks and <lb/>implement measures to prevent cross-contamination. <lb/>-Learners should understand the principle of line clear-<lb/>ance and be able to ensure that a production line or area <lb/>is clear of materials not needed for the next batch, <lb/>preventing product mix-up and cross-contamination. <lb/>-Learners should understand the &apos;forward flow&apos; princi-<lb/>ple and ensure a unidirectional flow of materials in the <lb/>production process, from receiving raw materials to <lb/>dispatching finished products, thereby preventing cross-<lb/>contamination, and maintaining process integrity. <lb/>-Learners should understand and implement standard <lb/>procedures for equipment cleaning and workspace <lb/>maintenance. Their skills should cover effective clean-<lb/>ing practices and proper material handling to ensure <lb/>quality and prevent contamination. <lb/>The handling of hazardous drug substances <lb/>The administration of hazardous medicinal substances is a <lb/>pivotal component of pharmaceutical operations, necessitating <lb/></body>

        <body>specialized attention and proficiency due to their inherent <lb/>risks. Management of these substances, especially those <lb/>categorized as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to repro-<lb/>duction (CMR), demands the capability to accurately identify <lb/>potential hazards and implement effective mitigation stra-<lb/>tegies throughout their lifecycle -from receipt to disposal -<lb/>following stipulated procedures and existing regulations (4). <lb/>These substances, their labelling, and their handling align <lb/>with REACH and CLP regulations (5). Crucial information for <lb/>handling these substances is encapsulated in Safety Data <lb/>Sheets (SDS), detailing the use of appropriate personal pro-<lb/>tective equipment (PPE) for enhanced safety (6). In light of <lb/>these considerations, the following points should be <lb/>addressed: <lb/>-Learners should be able to proficiently manage the <lb/>entire lifecycle of hazardous and carcinogenic, muta-<lb/>genic, or toxic for reproduction (CMR) substances from <lb/>receipt to disposal. This includes understanding the <lb/>storage requirements, handling procedures, tracking <lb/>methods, and safe, environmentally responsible waste <lb/>disposal practices for CMR substances in line with <lb/>relevant regulations. <lb/>-Learners should be able to accurately identify and <lb/>interpret hazard labels in compliance with REACH and <lb/>CLP regulations, including comprehending the signifi-<lb/>cance of pictograms, hazard statements, and precau-<lb/>tionary statements. <lb/>-Learners should be able to locate, interpret and effec-<lb/>tively apply the information contained in Safety Data <lb/>Sheets (SDS) for various hazardous chemicals, including <lb/>the application of protective measures and emergency <lb/>procedures. <lb/>-Learners should be able to correctly select and use indi-<lb/>vidual protective equipment (PPE) suitable for handling <lb/>various hazardous chemicals. This skill includes under-<lb/>standing the different types of PPE, such as gloves, safety <lb/>glasses, and respiratory protective equipment, and their <lb/>appropriate use based on the nature of the chemical <lb/>hazard and the task at hand. <lb/>-Learners should be able to effectively use and maintain <lb/>collective protective equipment (CPE) specific to <lb/>handling hazardous chemicals. This includes the un-<lb/>derstanding of different types of CPE such as fume <lb/>hoods, biosafety cabinets, and ventilation systems, and <lb/>their appropriate use and operation. <lb/>Weighing powders <lb/>Powder weighing is a key element in the quality of capsule <lb/>preparation. Among the factors influencing the quality of <lb/>this step, knowledge of the operating principles of precision <lb/>balances, their characteristics, handling and maintenance is <lb/>a key element in guaranteeing both measurement accuracy <lb/>and equipment durability (7). In light of these consider-<lb/>ations, the following points should be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should understand the operating principle of <lb/>precision scales and their different characteristics (e.g. <lb/>range, accuracy, linearity). <lb/>-Learners should know the correct handling and main-<lb/>tenance practices for precision scales to ensure their <lb/>accuracy and durability. <lb/>-Learners should know about common weighing errors <lb/>and the factors that can cause them (e.g. scale instability, <lb/>air currents, vibrations, static electricity). <lb/>-Learners should know the regulations and standards <lb/>applicable to weighing in pharmacies (e.g. calibration, <lb/>control, traceability). <lb/>-Learners should be able to select a valid and appropriate <lb/>scale for the quantities to be weighed. <lb/>-Learners should be able to properly set up and calibrate <lb/>a precision balance, taking into account environmental <lb/>conditions and specific weighing requirements. <lb/>-Learners should be able to handle powders appropri-<lb/>ately to minimize contamination, material loss, and dust <lb/>generation, using suitable tools and techniques. <lb/>-Learners should be able to identify and troubleshoot <lb/>weighing issues during the process, adjusting balance pa-<lb/>rameters, or applying appropriate corrective techniques. <lb/>Measuring a volume of powder <lb/>Measuring the apparent volume of a powder is a key step in <lb/>capsule preparation, as it directly influences the accuracy of <lb/>the dosage obtained. This apparent volume corresponds to <lb/>the space occupied by a powder, including the empty spaces <lb/>between the particles, and is strongly influenced by the size, <lb/>shape, distribution, and arrangement of the particles. Fac-<lb/>tors such as humidity, static loading and handling methods <lb/>can further alter the flow characteristics and apparent vol-<lb/>ume of the powder, which can affect the reproducibility of <lb/>the specimen filling process (8). A preliminary powder <lb/>sieving step may be necessary to standardize particle sizes. <lb/>In light of these considerations, the following points should <lb/>be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should know the factors affecting the apparent <lb/>volume of powders, such as particle size, particle shape, <lb/>moisture content, and packing. <lb/>-Learners should comprehend the integral role of sieving <lb/>in ensuring particle size uniformity during capsule <lb/>compounding, refine techniques for optimal sieve <lb/></body>

        <body>usage, and recognize the criticality of rigorous sieve <lb/>sanitation to mitigate cross-contamination risks (9). <lb/>-Learners should know the difference between bulk and <lb/>tapped density (7). <lb/>-Learners should know the different types of measuring <lb/>cylinders and their respective characteristics (e.g. ac-<lb/>curacy, graduation) that are suitable for powder volume <lb/>measurements. <lb/>-Learners should be able to select a valid and appropriate <lb/>measuring cylinder for the quantities to be measured. <lb/>-Learners should be able to accurately and consistently <lb/>fill the measuring cylinder with the powder, minimizing <lb/>air pockets and avoiding compaction or segregation of <lb/>particles. <lb/>-Learners should be able to read the apparent volume of <lb/>the powder in the measuring cylinder, taking into <lb/>account the meniscus and potential sources of error or <lb/>bias. <lb/>Mixing powders <lb/>Mixing powders in capsule compounding is essential for <lb/>achieving uniform active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) <lb/>distribution, a key determinant of dosage accuracy. The <lb/>homogeneity of the mixture depends on particle size, dis-<lb/>tribution, and physical characteristics like density, shape, <lb/>and surface properties (10). Additionally, factors such as <lb/>equipment selection, mixing technic, velocity, and duration <lb/>influence blending efficacy (11). Errors during the mixing <lb/>process may contribute to inconsistencies in content uni-<lb/>formity during the capsule assay procedure. In light of these <lb/>considerations, the following points should be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should know which factors related to powders <lb/>may impact the quality of the mixtures. <lb/>-Learners should know about the importance of particle <lb/>size reduction and even distribution of particles when <lb/>mixing powders for pharmaceutical applications. <lb/>-Learners should know about the different types of <lb/>mortars and pestles (e.g. glass, porcelain, and stainless <lb/>steel) and their respective characteristics and suitability <lb/>for various powder types. <lb/>-Learners should be able to select the appropriate mortar <lb/>and pestle for a specific powder type and mixing appli-<lb/>cation, considering factors such as material compati-<lb/>bility, size, and ease of cleaning. <lb/>-Learners should be able to use the proper techniques for <lb/>mixing powders with a mortar and pestle, such as trit-<lb/>uration, and geometric dilution, to achieve a uniform <lb/>and homogenous mixture. <lb/>-Learners should be able to monitor the mixing process <lb/>to ensure that the desired particle size reduction and <lb/>distribution are achieved, making adjustments to the <lb/>technique or mixing time as necessary unless otherwise <lb/>specified in a procedure. <lb/>-If using machines, learners should know how to correctly <lb/>load and unload powders from the mixing machine to <lb/>minimize material loss and cross-contamination. This <lb/>includes the correct use of containers, scoops, or other <lb/>tools. <lb/>-If using machines, learners should be able to effectively <lb/>operate the mixing machine, including adjusting set-<lb/>tings for mixing time, speed, and intensity. They should <lb/>understand the implications of these settings on the <lb/>quality of the final mix. <lb/>Filling capsules <lb/>Manual filling of capsules plays a significant role in com-<lb/>pounding, that can directly impact the mass uniformity of <lb/>capsules. This process, when conducted using manual filler, <lb/>relies heavily on the operator&apos;s skill, accuracy, and consis-<lb/>tency. The powder&apos;s flow properties, including particle size <lb/>and distribution, external factors such as humidity and <lb/>temperature that may affect the powder&apos;s characteristics <lb/>can affect filling uniformity (12, 13). Similarly, variations in <lb/>applied pressure during the filling process may cause dis-<lb/>parities in fill volume and, subsequently, mass uniformity. <lb/>Hence, meticulous operator technique and understanding of <lb/>powder characteristics are essential for maintaining mass <lb/>uniformity in manually filled capsules. In light of these <lb/>considerations, the following points should be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should know about the different types of <lb/>capsule fillers, such as manual, semi-automatic, and <lb/>automatic, as well as their respective characteristics and <lb/>suitability for various production scales and powder <lb/>types. <lb/>-Learners should know about the factors affecting <lb/>capsule filling accuracy, such as powder flow properties, <lb/>capsule shell quality, and equipment settings. <lb/>-Learners should be able to select the appropriate <lb/>capsule size, colour and type (e.g. gelatin or vegetable-<lb/>based) based on the intended dosage and patient <lb/>population. <lb/>-Learners should be able to select the appropriate <lb/>capsule filler for a specific powder formulation and <lb/>production scale, considering factors such as material <lb/>compatibility, dosage accuracy, and production <lb/>efficiency. <lb/></body>

        <body>-Learners should be able to set up the capsule filler, ac-<lb/>cording to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>-Learners should be able to operate the capsule filler to <lb/>fill capsules accurately and consistently with the powder <lb/>formulation, monitoring the process for any issues or <lb/>inconsistencies, and adjusting as necessary. <lb/>Documentation and traceability <lb/>In capsule compounding, documentation serves as a crucial <lb/>element for consistency, traceability, adherence to local best <lb/>practices for compounding, and facilitates continuous pro-<lb/>cess improvement. It encompasses recording of each com-<lb/>pounding step, materials utilized, and any encountered <lb/>deviations. Through this, any batch of compounded capsules <lb/>can be traced back through its production and distribution, <lb/>improving accountability and enabling rapid response if <lb/>quality issues arise. Insufficient or inaccurate documenta-<lb/>tion, however, can compromise these aspects and potentially <lb/>affect the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the finished <lb/>product and future productions. In light of these consider-<lb/>ations, the following points should be addressed: <lb/>-Learners should know how to properly document each <lb/>step of the compounding process, including the <lb/>recording of raw materials (source, lot number, expi-<lb/>ration date), equipment used, environmental condi-<lb/>tions, and the specifics of each procedure performed. <lb/>-Learners should be able to prepare and maintain <lb/>comprehensive and up-to-date batch production records <lb/>that document each step of the compounding process, <lb/>including the specific raw materials, equipment, and <lb/>personnel involved. <lb/>-Learners should ensure to record any deviations from <lb/>the established procedure and the corrective actions <lb/>taken in response to these deviations. <lb/>-Learners should understand the importance of trans-<lb/>parent error reporting. They should be trained to <lb/>document any errors promptly and thoroughly, <lb/>including details of the incident, the root cause, the <lb/>corrective actions taken, and the steps planned to <lb/>prevent recurrence. <lb/>Suggested test formulations <lb/>In order to evaluate the learner&apos;s skills, the following for-<lb/>mulations are suggested. The selection of the appropriate <lb/>capsule size is among the skills to be tested. The number of <lb/>capsules (e.g. 100, 200 or 300) to be prepared is left to the <lb/>examiner&apos;s discretion, depending on the skills to be <lb/>evaluated, particularly regarding the use of small or large <lb/>capsule filler. <lb/>Microcrystalline cellulose capsules <lb/>Without an active ingredient present, these capsules <lb/>(Table 1) serve as a safe method for testing the standard <lb/>operating procedures in capsule preparation, and for <lb/>assessing the learner&apos;s proficiency during the capsule filling <lb/>stage. The accuracy of measuring the apparent volume may <lb/>significantly impact the success of this stage.

As the <lb/>powder density varies with the granulometric reduction of <lb/>the active ingredient, any lack of homogeneity may be <lb/>perceived in terms of mass. The preparation could be <lb/>controlled by conducting a mass uniformity test (see sup-<lb/>plementary material). A uniformity of content test can also <lb/>be carried out. <lb/>Micronized spironolactone (1 mg) capsules <lb/>The challenge in the preparation of these capsules (Table 3) <lb/>lies in the dilution of a micronized active ingredient present <lb/>in a very small quantity.

        <body>the proper application of procedures for handling dangerous <lb/>substances is essential. This preparation must be tested for <lb/>both mass and content uniformity to reveal any preparation <lb/>flaws. It is recommended to calculate the corrected contents <lb/>to attribute the source of error to either the blending or the <lb/>capsule filling process (see supplementary material). <lb/>Amiodarone hydrochloride (60 mg) capsules <lb/>Amiodarone hydrochloride is a powder that tends to be very <lb/>sticky due to its hygroscopic nature (i.e. it absorbs moisture <lb/>from the air). This property can make it difficult to mix <lb/>amiodarone hydrochloride with excipients when preparing <lb/>capsules (Table 4), as it can clump together and not disperse <lb/>uniformly. Amiodarone is also classified as a hazardous <lb/>substance, with CMR (Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, or toxic to <lb/>Reproduction) therefore the proper application of proced-<lb/>ures for handling dangerous substances is essential. This <lb/>preparation must be tested for both mass and content <lb/>uniformity to reveal any preparation flaws. It is recom-<lb/>mended to calculate the corrected contents to attribute the <lb/>source of error to either the blending or the capsule filling <lb/>process (see supplementary material). <lb/>Conclusion and perspective <lb/>From the perspective of a pharmacy manager, this document <lb/>underscores the criticality of structured training and quali-<lb/>fication for pharmacy staff involved in manual capsule <lb/>preparation. It highlights the multifaceted nature of the <lb/>process and the potential risks if not done correctly, making <lb/>it clear that staff training cannot be overlooked. Effective <lb/>training can reduce content and mass uniformity errors in <lb/>capsule compounding. This results from enhanced under-<lb/>standing and execution of powder handling, equipment <lb/>operation, and capsule filling procedures. While recognizing <lb/>the importance of knowledge acquisition, it underscores the <lb/>significance of practical skills applicable in real-world sce-<lb/>narios, thereby indicating the necessity for competence-<lb/>based certification. <lb/></body>
