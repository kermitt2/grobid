Since SFs target a broad range of nucleophilic amino acids, <lb/>they deliver an approach for the covalent modification of proteins without requirement for a proximal cysteine residue. Further to <lb/>this, libraries of reactive fragments present an innovative approach for the discovery of ligands and tools for proteins of interest by <lb/>leveraging a breadth of mass spectrometry analytical approaches. Herein, we report a screening approach that exploits the unique <lb/>properties of SFs for this purpose. Libraries of SF-containing reactive fragments were synthesized, and a direct-to-biology workflow <lb/>was taken to efficiently identify hit compounds for CAII and BCL6. The most promising hits were further characterized to establish <lb/>the site(s) of covalent modification, modification kinetics, and target engagement in cells. Crystallography was used to gain a detailed <lb/>molecular understanding of how these reactive fragments bind to their target. It is anticipated that this screening protocol can be <lb/>used for the accelerated discovery of &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; covalent inhibitors. <lb/></front>

			<body>■ INTRODUCTION <lb/>The impact of cysteine-targeting covalent modifiers has <lb/>spurred interest in the development of complementary <lb/>&quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; approaches to target additional amino acid <lb/>residues and thus expand applicability across the proteome <lb/>(Figure 1a). 1-5 Sulfur(VI) fluorides (SFs) have emerged as <lb/>useful electrophiles for this application, targeting multiple <lb/>nucleophilic amino acid residues, including lysine, 6 tyrosine, 7 <lb/>and serine. 8 The prevalence of these residues in almost all <lb/>protein pockets makes SFs promising functional groups for the <lb/>development of covalent inhibitors for proteins and expansion <lb/>of the liganded proteome. 9-16 Recently, several SF-containing <lb/>modulators have been reported, which enabled covalent <lb/>modification of protein pockets without targeting a cysteine. <lb/>Examples include &quot;XO44&quot; for broad-spectrum kinase profil-<lb/>ing, 17 various SF-containing ligands for targeting G protein-<lb/>coupled receptors including the human adenosine A 3 <lb/>receptor, 18 and &quot;EM12-SO 2 F&quot;/&quot;EM12-FS&quot; which modulate <lb/>cereblon. 19 These were developed by structure-based, rational <lb/>installation of the SF group on optimized noncovalent <lb/>scaffolds. The development of complementary &quot;bottom-up&quot; <lb/>approaches will be useful for discovering ligands for targets that <lb/>have low tractability to noncovalent ligands. 20 <lb/>Reactive fragment screening has emerged as a useful strategy <lb/>for the discovery of chemical probes for protein targets of <lb/>interest. 21 These approaches couple the utility of fragments in <lb/>enabling the efficient coverage of chemical space, with a <lb/>reactive functionality that traps weak protein-ligand inter-<lb/>actions to improve binding, and enable robust detection by <lb/>intact protein liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry <lb/>(LC-MS) (Figure 1b). 22,23 Covalent capture provides access <lb/>to a suite of follow-up studies that further characterize the <lb/>interaction, including determination of the site(s) of binding, <lb/>measurement of kinetic parameters, and assessment of in-cell <lb/>target engagement. 3,24,25 To date, the approach has been <lb/>limited to cysteine-targeting covalent inhibitors for challenging <lb/>targets, including HOIP and KRAS G12C , which led to the <lb/>discovery of the Food and Drug Administration-approved <lb/>therapeutic AMG 510. 3,26 Chemistries that enable the <lb/>screening of electrophilic libraries to target alternative <lb/>nucleophilic residues would greatly expand the number of <lb/></body>

			<body>an expedient and accessible method for the rapid and iterative <lb/>generation of SF-reactive fragment libraries. 27-29 <lb/>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>The SF-based reactive fragment screening approach was <lb/>developed in two stages: first, the development of an <lb/>appropriate SF fragment library and second, the application <lb/>of this library in screens against three protein targets. A <lb/>modular library was employed by linking a diverse set of <lb/>amine-functionalized fragments to an SF-containing reactive <lb/>moiety. Three SFs were selected that spanned a range of <lb/>intrinsic reactivities, based on previous profiling of SF <lb/>functionalities. 14 These included aromatic sulfonyl fluorides 1 <lb/>(meta-substituted) and 2 (para-substituted with a methylene <lb/>spacer), as well as sulfamoyl fluoride 3 (azetidine-linked) <lb/>(Figure 2a). <lb/>HTC Synthesis of an SF-Reactive Fragment Library. <lb/>An HTC protocol for the generation of the reactive fragment <lb/>libraries was pursued to enable the rapid generation of SF <lb/>fragments in 384-well plates. This allowed for screening in a <lb/>D2B format as crude reaction mixtures, circumventing the <lb/>requirement for purification and thus accelerating reactive <lb/>fragment library screens. 29 <lb/>A succinimide-activated (OSu) amide coupling was <lb/>employed using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-ethyl-<lb/>morpholine (NEM) as the solvent and base, respectively. 29 <lb/>The conditions were initially trialed on a panel of 12 diverse <lb/>amine-functionalized fragments by the addition of SF-reactive <lb/>moieties (1a, 2a, and 3a) in both dry DMSO and DMSO/ <lb/>water (9:1) to assess robustness to hydrolysis under the <lb/>reaction conditions. After 1 h incubation, reactions with OSu <lb/>esters 2a and 3a afforded good conversion to the desired <lb/>products and tolerance of 10% water, while meta-substituted <lb/>OSu ester 1a gave poorer conversions due to hydrolysis of the <lb/>SF group to the sulfonic acid (see Figures S1 and S2). 14 Thus, <lb/>compounds 2a and 3a were selected for library synthesis. Over <lb/>longer incubation times, the SF products were observed to <lb/>slowly hydrolyze to the sulfonic acids under the basic reaction <lb/>conditions. As such, library synthesis was performed using a 1 <lb/>h reaction incubation time, followed by direct transfer to <lb/>protein-containing buffer solution to limit base catalyzed <lb/>hydrolysis of the SF fragments. <lb/>Two 352-membered SF-reactive fragment libraries were <lb/>subsequently synthesized employing para-substituted reactive <lb/>moiety 2 and azetidine-linked reactive moiety 3. A set of 352 <lb/>amine-functionalized fragments were selected from the GSK <lb/>compound collection by first filtering for fragment-like <lb/>properties (aromatic ring count ≤2; HBDs/HBAs ≤4; heavy <lb/>atoms ≤ 15; 150 &lt; M W ≤ 250) and then selecting for maximal <lb/>chemical diversity by clustering on chemical fingerprints (see <lb/>Figure S3). 30 Owing to the slow hydrolysis of the products <lb/>under basic reaction conditions, it was not possible to perform <lb/>LC-MS analysis of the whole plate, which would require ∼24 <lb/>h. Thus, LC-MS analysis was performed on six wells selected <lb/>at random, which indicated good conversion to the desired <lb/>products, and conversions were found to be highly <lb/>reproducible across three library syntheses conducted on <lb/>separate occasions (see Figure S4). The high yields and <lb/>reproducibility observed were consistent with related HTC-<lb/>D2B protocols developed in our group employing photo-<lb/>reactive fragments. 29 <lb/>D2B Screening against a Range of Purified Proteins. <lb/>A panel of three proteins were selected for screening SF-<lb/>reactive fragment libraries: CAII, KRAS4B G12D , and BCL6. <lb/>These proteins were selected to sample broad structural <lb/>diversity and biological function while also being of therapeutic <lb/>relevance. None of the proteins contain a catalytic nucleophilic <lb/>amino acid residue, which allowed us to probe the utility of the <lb/>SFs in targeting nucleophilic amino acid residues present in the <lb/>vicinity of binding pockets. <lb/>Initially, the more reactive library, containing para-<lb/>substituted aryl sulfonyl fluoride 2, was screened against the <lb/>three proteins (24 h incubation, 4 or 20 °C) and directly <lb/>analyzed by intact protein LC-MS (0.5 or 1 μM protein and <lb/>20 or 50 μM SF) (Figure 2b). Across all screens, the majority <lb/>of wells contained unmodified protein, indicating that the SF-<lb/>reactive moieties were not yielding nonspecific covalent <lb/>modifications. However, for some of the wells, the resultant <lb/>mass spectra displayed additional peaks with mass shifts <lb/>consistent with the covalent modification of the protein by the <lb/>SF fragment, accompanied by the loss of HF as expected for <lb/>the reaction between the nucleophilic amino acid residue with <lb/>the SF group: [protein + SF -HF]. A range of modification <lb/>yields were observed, and the hit threshold for each screen was <lb/>defined as the mean percentage modification + 2 standard <lb/>deviations. Hits were also prioritized based on the overall <lb/>extent of modification, with some showing modification greater <lb/>than 50% (e.g., 2b-e with CAII), while others showed <lb/>modification less than 50% (e.g., 2f-i with BCL6) (Figure 2c). <lb/>All hits gave a single modification event on the protein, <lb/>consistent with recognition-driven modification. Hits contain-<lb/>ing reactive moiety 2 from the screens against CAII and BCL6 <lb/>were resynthesized and purified for use in further inves-<lb/>tigations. Disappointingly, no hits were observed for <lb/>KRAS G12D , consistent with the fact that this is considered to <lb/>be a poorly tractable target. 25 The library containing the less-<lb/>reactive sulfamoyl fluoride 3 was screened against CAII but <lb/>afforded no hits, suggesting an insufficient intrinsic reactivity of <lb/>the electrophile. <lb/>Site(s) of Binding for CAII Hits. Carbonic anhydrase II <lb/>(CAII) is a metalloenzyme responsible for the interconversion <lb/>of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate for which noncovalent <lb/>inhibitors have been developed as treatments for glaucoma, <lb/>oedema, and cancer. 31,32 CAII inhibitors are typically based on <lb/>aromatic sulfonamide pharmacophores, which interact with the <lb/>Zn 2+ ion via the sulfonamide group. 33 <lb/>The HTC-D2B screen with CAII afforded four hits (2b-e) <lb/>with modification yields of 66-75% (see Figure S5). Three of <lb/>these hits contained an aromatic sulfonamide, consistent with <lb/>known inhibitors, while one of the four (2c) was an aliphatic <lb/>sulfonamide, of which there are few prior reports. These four <lb/>compounds were the only primary sulfonamides in the library, <lb/>and the remainder of the library gave an average modification <lb/>yield of &lt;1%, indicating negligible nonspecific modification <lb/>and high specificity of the hit fragment interactions. <lb/>The site of binding was investigated by displacement <lb/>studies. 34 For this, we used the CAII inhibitor ethoxzolamide <lb/>(4) (K i = 8 nM), which is known to bind within the Zn 2+ <lb/>pocket. 31 The resynthesized and purified SFs (100 μM) were <lb/>coincubated with either ethoxzolamide (50 μM) or DMSO as <lb/>a control, with CAII (0.5 μM). Inspection of the resultant mass <lb/>spectra after a 24 h incubation revealed that the presence of <lb/>ethoxzolamide had abolished covalent modification for all hits <lb/>2b-e, indicating binding to the same site (Figure 3a). <lb/>Tandem MS analyses were subsequently employed for <lb/>identification of the amino acid residue(s) that was covalently <lb/></body>

			<body>modified. Samples of CAII modified by the resynthesized and <lb/>purified SFs 2d and 2e were digested using trypsin and <lb/>analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This identified peptides 59 ILNN-<lb/>GH*AFNVEFDDSQDKAVLK 80 and 59 ILNNGH*AFN-<lb/>VEFDDSQDK 76 as the major site(s) of modification on <lb/>His64 for both 2d (366 Da) (see Figure S6) and 2e (380 Da) <lb/>(Figure 3b), respectively. Further to this, minor modifications <lb/>were observed on the N-terminal peptide 1 MSHHWGYGK 9 at <lb/>His3 (2d and 2e) and Tyr7 (2d only). <lb/>To rationalize these observations, virtual dockings were <lb/>carried out on SFs 2d and 2e, based on the reported binding <lb/>mode of ethoxzolamide (PDB: 3CAJ). For 2e, the docking <lb/>indicated that the sulfonamide was bound to the Zn 2+ cofactor, <lb/>and the His64 residue was proximal to the SF group, just 7 Å <lb/>away, and appears well poised for reaction (Figures 3c and <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>S7). 35 Similarly, for 2d, the Zn 2+ -sulfonamide interaction was <lb/>observed, and the SF group was in the vicinity of His64, as well <lb/>as residues His3 and Tyr7 which were also found to carry <lb/>minor modifications (see Figure S8). <lb/>Kinetic Analyses of CAII Hits. The kinetics of binding <lb/>were investigated by incubation of the resynthesized and <lb/>purified SFs 2b-e with CAII at a range of concentrations and <lb/>analysis by intact protein LC-MS over a 24 h period (see <lb/>Figure S9). The concentration-response was analyzed based <lb/>on a two-step model of reversible ligand (L) binding and <lb/>subsequent irreversible covalent modification of the protein <lb/>(P) (P + L ⇌ P•L → PL) (see Figure S10). 24 Time courses <lb/>were fit to a single exponential function to give a k obs for each <lb/>concentration (Figure 3d). These were then fitted using a <lb/>Michaelis-Menten model to determine k inact (corresponding <lb/>to the rate of covalent-bond formation) and K I (corresponding <lb/>to the recognition of the ligand for the protein pocket) (Figure <lb/>3e,f). All fragments were found to have strong reversible <lb/>affinity (K I ), and these were below the minimum concentration <lb/>screened for 2d and 2e (&lt;5 μM). This is consistent with the <lb/>strong binding of aryl sulfonamides to the CAII Zn 2+ binding <lb/>pocket. 33 The SFs exhibited unexpectedly slow rates of <lb/>covalent modification, with 50% modification achieved <lb/>between 6.5 and 10.5 h for all 100 μM conditions. The slow <lb/>rate of the reaction may be attributed to a suboptimal <lb/>trajectory of the SF group toward the His64 residue in the <lb/>reversible bound conformation and/or low nucleophilicity of <lb/>the residue. 14 <lb/>An advantage of the HTC-D2B approach taken with this <lb/>screening strategy is the opportunity to rapidly explore iterative <lb/>libraries of compounds which are structurally similar to the <lb/>original hits identified. Such iteration-based screens allow for <lb/>faster design-make-test cycles in contrast to traditional <lb/>methods in early-stage drug discovery, leading to the more <lb/>efficient identification of potent and selective probes. 29 To <lb/>explore whether any alternative sulfonamide-containing frag-<lb/>ments would give high modification yields at a faster rate, a <lb/>new library was designed. For this, 96 amine-functionalized <lb/>fragment analogues of hits 2b-e were selected, coupled to <lb/>OSu ester 2a, and the resultant library was incubated with <lb/>CAII for 1 h prior to analysis by intact protein LC-MS. <lb/>Inspection of the resultant mass spectra after this short <lb/>incubation revealed many fragment hits that exhibited <lb/>significantly higher modification yields (&gt;70%, see Figure <lb/>S11) when compared with the original hits (&lt;15% at 1 h, see <lb/>Figure 3d). This improvement in rate of modification is <lb/>particularly notable given that the second-generation HTC-<lb/>D2B library would be unlikely to have 100% purity as <lb/>compared to the purified hits from the first-generation library. <lb/>The improvement in potency demonstrates the utility of the <lb/>HTC-D2B approach as a means to rapidly optimize kinetic <lb/>parameters, with respect to both reversible recognition (K i ) <lb/>and also the electrophile trajectory in determining k inact . <lb/>Assessment of Target Engagement in Cells for CAII <lb/>Hits. Hits from the CAII screen were progressed to <lb/>chemoproteomic profiling to determine cellular target engage-<lb/>ment and to measure their off-target profiles. SFs 2d and 2e <lb/>were functionalized with an alkyne handle at the linking amide <lb/>group to give probes 2j and 2k. A structurally similar negative <lb/>control was also designed by substitution of the sulfonamide <lb/>for a methoxy group, 2l (Figure 4a). The three probes were <lb/>first incubated with purified CAII, which confirmed that SFs 2j <lb/>and 2k covalently modified CAII following addition of the <lb/>alkyne group and that the methoxy group-containing negative <lb/>control 2l did not. The proteins engaged by these three probes <lb/>were subsequently studied in HEK293T cells. <lb/>HEK293T cells were treated for 1 h with probes 2j, 2k, or 2l <lb/>(10 μM) or the DMSO vehicle. Competition-based experi-<lb/>ments were also conducted where cells were pretreated with <lb/>parent hits 2d (40 μM) or 2e (40 μM) for 1 h, before the <lb/>addition of alkyne-containing probes 2j (10 μM) or 2k (10 <lb/>μM), respectively. Following incubation, treated cells were <lb/>lysed and conjugated with biotin-azide by Cu-click, and <lb/>biotinylated proteins were enriched using NeutrAvidin beads. <lb/>Enriched proteins were digested with LysC and trypsin, prior <lb/>to analysis by LC-MS/MS (Figure 4b). <lb/>All three probes (2j-l) were found to enrich multiple <lb/>proteins by comparison to the DMSO control (523, 501, and <lb/>447, respectively, log 2 ratio ≥0.58, p-value ≤0.05, and #unique <lb/>peptides ≥2), highlighting the promiscuity of the reactive <lb/>fragments in this environment. A good correlation was <lb/>observed between all three probes and the proteins enriched, <lb/>indicating that most of the enrichment was driven by the SF <lb/>moiety, rather than the fragment portion of the probes (Figure <lb/>4c). The most significantly enriched proteins included FABP5, <lb/>APMAP, and CRABP2. Previous reports identified that FABP5 <lb/>and CRABP2 were targeted by an arylfluorosulfate probe by <lb/>reaction at a tyrosine residue in each of these proteins. 36 While <lb/>some enrichment of CAII was observed for 2j and 2k, this was <lb/>poorly resolved among the many other enriched proteins. To <lb/>further investigate CAII engagement of the sulfonamide-<lb/>containing active probes (2j and 2k) in live cells, we compared <lb/>the enriched proteins to those enriched by the methoxy-<lb/>containing negative control (2l). This highlighted CAII as one <lb/>of the few differentially enriched proteins, suggesting that the <lb/>aryl sulfonamide fragment hits were driving cellular engage-<lb/>ment of CAII (Figure 4d,e). <lb/>Interestingly, competition experiments with 2d and 2e <lb/>showed relatively few significantly competed proteins, <lb/>suggesting that many of the interactions involved substoichio-<lb/>metric binding. This was true for CAII, where neither probes <lb/>2j nor 2k showed competition with parents 2d or 2e, <lb/>respectively. This is consistent with the slow rate of covalent <lb/>modification of CAII by 2d and 2e in the biochemical kinetic <lb/>analyses, which suggested that the protein would only be <lb/>partially modified after a 1 h incubation. Together, these <lb/>results indicate that while the aryl sulfonamide fragment hits <lb/>did engage CAII in cells, it was with low stoichiometry and <lb/>poor selectivity over many additional off-targets. <lb/>Further investigation of the off-targets revealed that some <lb/>proteins were competed in the presence of a parent, indicating <lb/>high levels of engagement; these included FABP5, PEBP1, <lb/>ABHD6, and LYPLA1 (Figure 4f,g). 37 ABHD6 and LYPLA1 <lb/>catalyze the hydrolysis of esters and thioesters, respectively, <lb/>and have nucleophilic catalytic residues which are likely to <lb/>react with the SF moiety. 38,39 Similarly, PEBP1 is a <lb/>phospholipid binder and is the prototype of a novel family <lb/>of serine protease inhibitors. 40 More specifically, each of these <lb/>proteins bind molecules containing hydrophobic alkyl chains, <lb/>consistent with previous reports involving SF-containing <lb/>probes targeting FABP5 in cells. 36 An alternative explanation <lb/>for these observations is the presence of a consistent benzene <lb/>SF group on each of the probes, which may be preferentially <lb/>bound by these proteins. The high levels of occupancy at these <lb/>targets suggest that they may be amenable to the development <lb/>of potent SF-based covalent inhibitors. <lb/></body>

			<body>BCL6 Follow-Up Studies: Site(s) of Binding and Hit <lb/>Expansion. The transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 <lb/>(BCL6) has been identified as a driver of oncogenesis in <lb/>lymphoid malignancies. BCL6 is implicated in several protein-<lb/>protein interactions with corepressors, and disruption of these <lb/>interactions is currently being investigated as a strategy for <lb/>cancer treatment. 41 A range of small molecules that target <lb/>BCL6 have been reported, including reversible inhibitors such <lb/>as compound 11 (GSK137) and macrocyclic compound <lb/>12. 41,42 Compounds with alternative mechanisms have also <lb/>been reported, including degraders such as compound 13 (BI-<lb/>3802) and more recently rationally designed covalent inhibitor <lb/>14 (TMX-2164) that targets Tyr57 (Figure 5a,b). 43,44 <lb/>The top hits from the SF screen with BCL6 represented two <lb/>distinct chemotypes: meta-substituted benzamides (2f and 2g) <lb/>and azetidine aryl ethers (2h and 2i). These were <lb/>resynthesized and purified for follow-up studies. Tandem MS <lb/>was used to identify the amino acid residue(s) responsible for <lb/>covalent modification, and interestingly, the two different <lb/>chemotypes were found to target two different residues (Figure <lb/>5c,d). The results showed that meta-substituted benzamides 2f <lb/>(373 Da) and 2g (344 Da) modified Tyr57 on the peptide <lb/>47 TVLMACSGLFY*SIFTDQLKR 66 , and azetidine aryl ethers <lb/>2h (365 Da) and 2i (372 Da) modified His115 on the peptide <lb/>98 EGNIMAVMATAMYLQMEH*VVDTCR 121 (see Figure <lb/>S12). Tyr57 has previously been targeted by a BCL6 inhibitor <lb/>(14, TMX-2164); however, the targeting of His115 is a novel <lb/>modification; these residues are located on opposite sides of <lb/>the binding site of previously reported BCL6 inhibitors (11-<lb/>14) (see Figure 5b). <lb/>An iterative screen was subsequently carried out with the <lb/>intention of expanding the pool of hit compounds and <lb/>identifying BCL6 hits with higher covalent modification yields. <lb/>For this, a new 352-membered library of SF-based reactive <lb/>fragments was designed based on a similarity search of <lb/>available amine-functionalized fragments using the top four <lb/>original hits (2f-i). The library was generated by HTC, <lb/>incubated with BCL6 in a D2B fashion, and subsequently <lb/>Figure 5. BCL6 hits validated and expanded upon with iterative screen.

			<body>analyzed by intact protein LC-MS. The extent of covalent <lb/>modifications observed for this screen was markedly higher, <lb/>with many further hits discovered (2m-t). This included five <lb/>reactive fragments which gave covalent modification yields <lb/>greater than the maximum modification yields observed in the <lb/>original screen and three hits with over 50% modification <lb/>(Figure 5e,f). The meta-substituted benzamides gave the <lb/>higher modification yields, and several different groups in the <lb/>meta position were well-tolerated. Other hits showed that <lb/>different N-containing saturated heterocycles with alternative <lb/>heteroatom links to aryl groups were also tolerated by the <lb/>binding pocket. <lb/>Structural and Biophysical Investigations into BCL6 <lb/>Hits. With additional hits identified from the iterative screen, <lb/>we sought to obtain further structural and biophysical <lb/>information to better understand how these reactive fragments <lb/>bind to BCL6. A total of eight SF hits were resynthesized and <lb/>purified: the four from the original screen (2f-i) and four from <lb/>the iterative screen (2p, 2q, 2s, and 2t). To confirm that these <lb/>eight hits targeted the same binding site as previously reported <lb/>binders, GSK137 (biochemical pIC 50 = 8) was used as a <lb/>known inhibitor for a displacement experiment. 42 The SFs <lb/>(100 μM) were incubated for 24 h with BCL6 in the presence <lb/>of GSK137 (100 μM) or DMSO as a control, and the samples <lb/>were analyzed by intact protein LC-MS. The resultant mass <lb/>spectra showed that covalent modification was attenuated by <lb/>78-96% for all eight SFs, indicating that all hits were <lb/>competing for the same site (Figure 6a). 42 <lb/>We subsequently analyzed protein-fragment interactions <lb/>using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore the <lb/>impact of these binding events on protein stability. 45 The <lb/>azetidinyl/piperidinyl fragments exhibited negligible thermal <lb/>shifts (see Figure S13b,c); however, the meta-substituted <lb/>benzamide complexes were highly thermally stabilized (ΔT m ∼ <lb/>7 °C) relative to unmodified BCL6, which implied the <lb/>presence of intermolecular interactions from ligand binding <lb/>(Figure 6b). This level of stabilization was comparable to that <lb/>observed for the potent, noncovalent inhibitor GSK137 (ΔT m <lb/>∼ 12 °C, see Figure S13d). 42 Kinetic analyses of the four hits <lb/>from the original screen (2f-i) revealed that for the meta-<lb/>substituted benzamides, the reversible affinities of these <lb/>fragments were relatively weak, with K I = 56 and 80 μM for <lb/>2f and 2g, respectively (see Figure S14). Therefore, it was <lb/>interesting to observe a thermal shift similar to an inhibitor <lb/>with biochemical pIC50 = 8; this illustrates the impact of <lb/>covalent modification on protein-ligand binding. <lb/>Crystal structures of SFs 2f and 2s within BCL6 were <lb/>generated to further investigate the binding mode of the <lb/>fragments; this used a previously published protocol. 42 <lb/>Cocrystal structures of 2f and 2s with BCL6 (solved to 1.6 <lb/>and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed Tyr57 covalently <lb/>conjugated to the fragments via a sulfonate ester, consistent <lb/>Figure 6. Investigations of BCL6 hits provide further structural insights into binding modes of hit SFs. (a) Incubation of GSK137 with BCL6 <lb/>abolishes covalent modification by meta-substituted benzamide and azetidinyl/piperidinyl SF fragments.

			<body>with tandem MS studies for SF 2f (Figure 6c,d). The residue <lb/>Arg27 was observed to be in close proximity to the sulfonyl <lb/>groups of 2f and 2s which may have catalyzed the covalent <lb/>modification of Tyr57 via hydrogen-bonding interactions. <lb/>While the meta-substitutions of the benzamides showed <lb/>opposite trajectories, a common binding surface of the <lb/>benzamide aryl ring was observed, suggesting that a <lb/>trisubstituted aryl group might be tolerated here (Figure 6e). <lb/>The twisted conformation of 2s could also represent a <lb/>premodified state of the protein-SF complex, which may <lb/>have become disrupted for 2f upon covalent modification with <lb/>Tyr57 to afford the extended conformation observed. The <lb/>structures of GSK137 and 2s were overlaid, revealing that the <lb/>two binding sites had significant overlap in the final <lb/>crystallographic state (Figure 6f). This suggested that 2s may <lb/>have similar inhibitory action to GSK137 on the BCL6 BTB/ <lb/>POZ domain. 42 <lb/>■ CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Covalent inhibitors are of high interest in chemical biology and <lb/>drug discovery for expansion of the liganded proteome and for <lb/>liganding challenging therapeutic targets. 46 The majority of <lb/>efforts to develop covalent inhibitors have focused on the <lb/>targeting of cysteine residues in the vicinity of protein pockets. <lb/>However, to tackle the increasing number of genetically <lb/>validated targets that drug discovery teams are presented with, <lb/>approaches to covalent ligand discovery without reliance on <lb/>cysteine are highly sought after. SFs offer the opportunity to <lb/>target a broad repertoire of nucleophilic amino acids and hence <lb/>are effective reactive moieties to consider for &quot;beyond-<lb/>cysteine&quot; covalent inhibitors. To date, SF-containing chemical <lb/>probes have been rationally designed based on structure-<lb/>guided approaches; this typically entails the installation of an <lb/>SF group onto a potent reversible scaffold. 47 Here, we have <lb/>demonstrated that sulfonyl fluoride-reactive fragments offer an <lb/>expedient approach to identify novel &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; <lb/>covalent ligands. <lb/>Screening a modest library of 352 fragments afforded hits for <lb/>two of the three proteins assessed, which were found to <lb/>interact with functionally relevant pockets. An advantage of <lb/>screening with reactive fragments over classical reversible <lb/>fragments is the facile identification of the site(s) of covalent <lb/>modification using tandem MS. Hits identified here were found <lb/>to modify tyrosine and histidine residues. The observation of <lb/>histidine modification under the denaturing MS workflows was <lb/>perhaps surprising since previous reports have suggested that <lb/>histidine adducts of SFs can be unstable. The multiple <lb/>examples of histidine modification provide evidence that this <lb/>is not always the case and that SFs are suitable electrophiles for <lb/>targeting histidine residues. 10,19,48,49 <lb/>Kinetic analyses of the CAII hits provided a measure of <lb/>covalent modification efficiencies and parameters k inact and K I . <lb/>Interestingly, the CAII original hits exhibited good non-<lb/>covalent affinity (K I ) but slow rates of covalent modification <lb/>(k inact ). This suggested either low nucleophilicity of the <lb/>histidine residue or suboptimal geometry for covalent <lb/>modification. An HTC-D2B screen of analogues close to the <lb/>original hits identified fragments that gave fast rates of <lb/>modification (&gt;70% covalent modification in &lt;1 h), high-<lb/>lighting the potential roles of electrophile position and <lb/>reactivity in the design of covalent inhibitors and the utility <lb/>of the HTC-D2B approach as a means to optimize both k inact <lb/>and K I . <lb/>The chemoproteomic analyses of the CAII hits revealed that <lb/>they engaged CAII in cells, however, at low stoichiometry, <lb/>likely due to the low k inact rates for these hits. The two CAII <lb/>hits and the negative control were also found to interact with <lb/>many additional proteins in cells (&gt;100), many of which were <lb/>common to all three SF compounds. This highlighted that <lb/>specificity is likely to be a key challenge to overcome when <lb/>developing SF-based inhibitors. Previous work in our group <lb/>has demonstrated that the reactivity of the SF electrophile is <lb/>highly tunable. 14 Therefore, it is anticipated that selective <lb/>target engagement in cells would be achievable through <lb/>reduction of the intrinsic reactivity of the SF while optimizing <lb/>k inact and K I for the target. The HTC-D2B approach described <lb/>here provides a useful strategy for performing this <lb/>optimization. <lb/>The SF fragment screen also identified novel hits for BCL6, <lb/>a therapeutic target under investigation for conditions such as <lb/>blood, breast, and lung cancers. 42 Interestingly, the screen <lb/>afforded two hit series that were found to covalently modify <lb/>residues on opposite sides of the same pocket, one to a <lb/>tyrosine and one to a histidine, highlighting the versatility of <lb/>the approach in targeting nucleophilic amino acid residues <lb/>within a binding pocket. In this case, the pool of hit <lb/>compounds was rapidly expanded upon by an iterative screen, <lb/>and the hits represented two novel chemotypes for BCL6. The <lb/>attenuation of covalent modification when incubated in the <lb/>presence of GSK137, a published BCL6 inhibitor, implied that <lb/>the fragments target a known small-molecule binding surface. 42 <lb/>Cocrystal structures of BCL6 with hit SFs were obtained, <lb/>which confirmed that the binding conformations overlapped <lb/>with that of GSK137, positing the fragment as a covalent probe <lb/>to aid the discovery of novel inhibitors of the BCL6 BTB/POZ <lb/>domain. <lb/>Collectively, these results demonstrate that SF-reactive <lb/>fragment screening offers an efficient approach for the <lb/>discovery of &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; covalent ligands. The HTC-<lb/>D2B approach enables rapid iterative design-make-test cycles <lb/>to drive toward more potent and selective chemical tools. This <lb/>HTC-D2B workflow facilitates the exploration of alternative <lb/>SF groups as the reactive moiety, which can be exploited to <lb/>reduce the intrinsic reactivity, and thus promiscuity, of the <lb/>fragments while simultaneously optimizing k inact and K I for the <lb/>target of interest. This will support the development of <lb/>covalent chemical probes to expand the liganded proteome and <lb/>ultimately further our understanding of disease biology. <lb/>■ METHODS <lb/>Full experimental details including synthesis and data processing are <lb/>provided in the Supporting Information. <lb/>HTC-D2B Protocol.
