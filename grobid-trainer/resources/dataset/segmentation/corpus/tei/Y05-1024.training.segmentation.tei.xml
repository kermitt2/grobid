			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Cellular phones are now widely used and those with Web browsing capability are becoming very <lb/>popular. Users can easily browse information provided on the World Wide Web such as news, <lb/>weather, and traffic report with the cellular phone screen in mobile environment. However, <lb/>obtaining necessary information from large database such as user&apos;s manual or travelers&apos; guide is <lb/>quite a task for users since searching for appropriate information from seas of data requires <lb/>cumbersome key operations. I n m o s t cases, users have to carefully navigate through deep <lb/>hierarchical structures of menus or have to type in complex combination of keys to enter some <lb/>keywords. <lb/>Text retrieval by voice input is one of the solutions for this problem. This paper presents a <lb/>telephone-based voice query retrieval system in Japanese which enables cellular phone users to <lb/>search through the user&apos;s manual. This system accepts spoken queries over the cellular phone with <lb/>large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and retrieves relevant parts from the <lb/>user&apos;s manual with text retrieval. T h e r e s u l t s a r e p r o v i d e d t o t h e u s e r a s a W e b p a g e b y <lb/>s y n c h r o n o u s l y activating the Web and the voice systems (Yoshida et al., 2002). Users can input <lb/>queries without complicated keystrokes and can view the list of results on the cellular phone screen. <lb/>With respect to voice input systems, a large number of interactive voice responses (IVR) systems <lb/>and spoken dialogue systems has been designed and developed over the years (Zue, 1997). As for <lb/>user&apos;s manual retrieval systems which accept voice input, Kawahara et al. (2003) has developed a <lb/>spoken dialogue system for appliance manuals. However, they mainly focus on the dialogue strategy <lb/>to select the appropriate result on screen-less systems such as VTR and FAX. On the other hand, <lb/>retrieval methods for voice input have been examined on a TREC query set (Barnett et al., 1997; <lb/>Crestani, 2000). <lb/>. However, text retrieval in TREC mainly aims to search open domain documents from long <lb/>queries, while our system is required to search closed domain documents such as user&apos;s manuals <lb/>based on short queries spoken over the cellular phone. <lb/>In order to apply text retrieval technique to speech-activated user&apos;s manual retrieval, we have <lb/>investigated queries for searching manuals in addition to the text of the manuals from a linguistic <lb/>viewpoint. We found that text retrieval for a user&apos;s manual has the following three difficulties. <lb/>1) The difficulty of identifying passages in a user&apos;s manual based on an individual word. <lb/>2) The difficulty of distinguishing affirmative and negative sentences which mean two different <lb/>features in the manual. <lb/>3) The difficulty of retrieving appropriate passages for a query using words not appearing in the <lb/>manual. <lb/>This paper presents how we overcome these difficulties using three techniques: 1) utilizing word <lb/>pairs with dependency relations, 2) distinguishing affirmative and negative expressions by auxiliary <lb/>verbs, and 3) converging synonyms with synonym dictionary. <lb/>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system configuration of our <lb/>speech-activated text retrieval system and how it works. Section 3 discusses the difficulties in text <lb/>retrieval in our system and presents our proposed techniques in detail. Section 4 shows the <lb/>developed prototype system and Section 5 reports its evaluation results. Finally Section 6 concludes <lb/>the paper. <lb/> 2. Speech-Activated Text Retrieval System <lb/> Our system receives spoken queries on the usage of the cellular phone and provides the list of <lb/>relevant passages in the user&apos;s manual. In this paper, a passage denotes a part of the document <lb/>corresponding to a feature in the user&apos;s manual. <lb/> 2.1. System Configuration <lb/> Figure 1 shows the configuration of our retrieval system. <lb/>The telephone service module receives a phone call from the user. This module prepares the search <lb/>operation by calling the LVCSR module, which recognizes the query spoken over the phone, and the <lb/>text retrieval module, which provides the search result for the query. <lb/> Telephone <lb/>Service <lb/>Module <lb/>Web <lb/>Service <lb/>Module <lb/>LVCSR <lb/>Module <lb/>Text <lb/>Retrieval <lb/>Module <lb/> User&apos;s <lb/>Manual <lb/>Index <lb/>Telephone <lb/>Network <lb/>The Internet <lb/>The Internet <lb/> Figure 1: The configuration of the prototype system. <lb/> Figure 2: The screen of the <lb/>cellular phone displaying the <lb/>search result. <lb/> </body>

			<body>The telephone service module sends the list of the relevant passages to the Web service module, <lb/>and then hangs up the phone. The Web service module provides the result to the user according to <lb/>the user&apos;s request via the internet. <lb/>We assume that the cellular phone screen displays about 30 letters per line and 15 lines of text <lb/>according to the specifications of recent popular cellular phones in Japan. We assign top ten <lb/>potential passages as the search result and display the title of them in order for the user to see with <lb/>ease. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the screen of the cellular phone displaying the search result. <lb/> 2.2. Example of Using the System <lb/> This section describes how our system works. Our system works in Japanese, but in the following <lb/>section, English translation is provided for the reader&apos;s convenience. In our system, the user obtains <lb/>the relevant passage in the user&apos;s manual with the voice query according to the following steps. <lb/> Step 1: The user first accesses the system&apos;s main page of our system with the cellular phone (Figure <lb/>3). The page contains two hyperlinks along with brief instructions and query examples. <lb/> Step 2: The user follows the first link labeled  &quot; Input query by voice. &quot; It is linked to the telephone <lb/>service module, allowing the user to call the telephone service module. <lb/> Step 3: The user inputs a query following the voice guidance from the system. The LVCSR module <lb/>recognizes it and outputs the result text. The text retrieval module searches the user&apos;s manual <lb/>from recognized text and outputs the top ten results. The user goes back to the main page after <lb/>the telephone service module hangs up the phone. <lb/> Step 4: The user follows the second link labeled  &quot; Show search results, &quot; which is linked to our Web <lb/>service module. Then the user views the result page which contains the title list of top ten results <lb/>(each passage consists of a title and a body). Figure 4 shows the example of the result page <lb/>responding to the voice query  &quot; How to change my email address. &quot; <lb/> Step 5: By selecting a title of a passage from the result list, the user retrieves the corresponding <lb/>body of the passage (Figure 5). If the result list contains no relevant passages, the user can go <lb/>back to the homepage and re-enter a query by speech. <lb/> Figure 3: The main page <lb/>of our system. <lb/> Figure 4: The result page <lb/>displaying the title list of <lb/>top ten results for the <lb/>query. <lb/> Figure 5: The body of <lb/>the passage displayed <lb/>when the user selects the <lb/>title in Figure 4. <lb/> 3. Text Retrieval for a User&apos;s Manual <lb/>3.1. The Problems on User&apos;s Manual Retrieval <lb/> In general, user&apos;s manual of equipment explains all functions extensively. Since the phrasing used in <lb/>a user&apos;s manual is often similar, expressions with small difference might appear in completely <lb/>different entries. We have investigated queries for searching manuals in addition to the text of the <lb/>manuals from a linguistic viewpoint and found that text retrieval for user&apos;s manual has the following <lb/>three difficulties. <lb/>1) It is difficult to identify passages in a user&apos;s manual based on an individual word. For example, a <lb/>word  &quot; mail &quot;  shows up in passages explaining various functions such as sending mails, receiving <lb/>mails, composing mails, and many others. In order to overcome this difficulty, we need to use <lb/>relations between words. <lb/>2) It is difficult to distinguish affirmative and negative sentences based on independent words. <lb/>Sentences with the same set of content words can mean two different features depending on <lb/>whether the sentence is in the affirmative or in the negative. This is often true in manual writings <lb/>where each function is described in pair: one activating and the other deactivating the function (ex. <lb/> &quot; Sending the caller number &quot; and  &quot; Not sending the caller number &quot; ). In order to overcome this <lb/>difficulty, we need to handle polarity indicated by auxiliary verbs. <lb/>3) It is difficult to retrieve appropriate passages for a query using words not appearing in the manual. <lb/>While the expression denoting an object is generally standardized in a user&apos;s manual, users often <lb/>indicate the object with other expressions. In order to overcome this difficulty, we need to <lb/>assimilate difference of various synonymous expressions. <lb/> 3.2. The Approaches for User&apos;s Manual Retrieval <lb/> The system retrieves relevant passages from the user&apos;s manual with a word-based text retrieval <lb/>method. The system generates indexes for content words in passages and obtains relevant passages <lb/>from the words in the query based on Okapi BM25 probabilistic retrieval model without relevance <lb/>feedback in principle (Robertson et al., 1993). In this model, the weight W of a passage P for a <lb/>query Q is defined as follows: <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> Q <lb/>T <lb/> T <lb/>TW <lb/>W <lb/> ) <lb/>( <lb/> qtf <lb/>k <lb/>qtf <lb/>k <lb/>tf <lb/>K <lb/>k <lb/>tf <lb/>k <lb/>w <lb/>T <lb/>TW <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/> ) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/> 5 <lb/>. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>. <lb/>0 <lb/>log <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> n <lb/>n <lb/>N <lb/>w <lb/>AVPL <lb/>PL <lb/>b <lb/>b <lb/>K <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> ) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/> Here T denotes a term in the query Q, N denotes the number of passages in the whole text, n <lb/> denotes the number of passages containing the term T, tf denotes the frequency of occurrence of the <lb/>term T within the passage P, qtf denotes the frequency of occurrence of the term T within the query <lb/> Q, PL denotes the length of the passage P, and AVPL denotes the average length of all passages. k  1 , <lb/> k  2 , and b are predefined constants. <lb/>

			In order to overcome the difficulties stated previously, we have expanded the retrieval model with <lb/>the following three techniques. <lb/>1) Utilization of word pairs with dependency relations <lb/>This technique assigns larger weight for passages including the same word pairs with dependency <lb/>relations as in the query. The system uses the following weight W  wp , which is simple extension of W: <lb/>W <lb/>k <lb/>W <lb/> NP <lb/>  <lb/>   wp <lb/>wp <lb/> where NP denotes the number of word pairs which appear both in the passage P and the query Q <lb/> with dependency relations. k  wp is predefined constants. <lb/>We detect the dependency between words by shallow dependency analysis without parsing. The <lb/>system assigns depend-to and depend-from attributes to each word based on its part of speech and <lb/>connects them according to the surrounding relationship (Satoh et al., 2003). <lb/>2) Distinction between the negative and the affirmative phrases by auxiliary verbs <lb/>This technique assigns the different weight on the term according to the condition whether an <lb/>auxiliary verb indicating negative polarity follows after the term. The system adds this condition to <lb/>each word after morphological analysis, and distinguishes words with different conditions. The <lb/>system uses the following weight W  aux instead of W: <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> Q <lb/>T <lb/>Q <lb/>T <lb/> T <lb/>TW <lb/>k <lb/>T <lb/>TW <lb/>T <lb/>TW <lb/>k <lb/>T <lb/>TW <lb/>W <lb/> ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/> aux <lb/>aux <lb/>aux <lb/> where T +  denotes the term T with this condition and T - denotes the term T without this condition. <lb/> k  aux is predefined constants. <lb/>3) Converging synonyms <lb/>This technique assumes the occurrence of synonymous expressions for a word as the occurrence of <lb/>the word itself in calculating the weight. The system converges various synonymous expressions <lb/>into the standard expression by using predefined synonym dictionary. The system accepts a set of <lb/>words with dependency relations as a synonymous expression in order to converge complex <lb/>synonymous expressions. <lb/>Table 1 shows an example of a synonym dictionary. An arrow sign denotes a dependency relation <lb/>between words. <lb/> Table 1: An example of a synonym dictionary <lb/>Standard Expression <lb/>Synonymous Expressions <lb/> saito <lb/>webu <lb/>hômupêji <lb/> (site) <lb/>(web) <lb/>(homepage) <lb/> chakushin&apos;on <lb/>chakushinmerodî <lb/>yobidashion <lb/> (ringtone) <lb/>(ring melody) <lb/>(phone beep) <lb/> ridaiaru <lb/>môichido  kakeru <lb/> (redial) <lb/>(again  call) <lb/> 4. Prototype System <lb/> We have constructed a prototype system to search through the manuals for cellular phone users <lb/>(Ishikawa et al., 2004). The user&apos;s manual contains about 14,000 passages and consists of about <lb/>4,000 unique words. The prototype system works in real time according to the user&apos;s operation. <lb/> 4.1. LVCSR Module <lb/>4.1.1. Language Model <lb/> A statistical language model (LM) with word and class n-gram estimates is used in our system. <lb/>Word 3-gram is backed off to word 2-gram, and word 2-gram is backed off to class 2-gram. Part-<lb/>of-speech patterns are used as the classes of each word. The LM is trained on a text corpus of query <lb/>samples for our target user&apos;s manual. Nouns in the manual document are added to the recognition <lb/>dictionary apart from the training. <lb/>A total of 15,000 queries were manually constructed and used for training the LM. The final LM <lb/>for the prototype system has about 4,000 words in the recognition vocabulary, about 20,000 word 2-<lb/>gram entries, and about 40,000 word 3-gram entries. <lb/> 4.1.2. Acoustic Model <lb/> A speech signal is sampled at 8kHz, with MFCC analysis frame rate of 10ms. Spectral subtraction <lb/>(SS) is applied to remove stationary additive noises. The feature set includes MFCC, pitch, and <lb/>energy with their time derivatives. The LVCSR decoder supports triphone HMMs with tree-based <lb/>state clustering on phonetic contexts. The state emission probability is represented by Gaussian <lb/>mixtures with diagonal covariance matrices. <lb/>For the prototype system, Gender-dependent acoustic models were prepared by the training on the <lb/>speech corpus with 200,000 sentences read by 1,385 speakers collected through telephone line. <lb/> 4.1.3. LVCSR Decoder <lb/> The LVCSR decoder recognizes the query utterances with the triphone acoustic model, the <lb/>statistical language model, and a tree-structured word dictionary. It performs two-stage processing. <lb/>On the first stage, input speech is decoded by frame-synchronous beam search to generate a word <lb/>candidate graph using the acoustic model, 2-gram language model, and the word dictionary. On the <lb/>second stage, the graph is searched to find the optimal word sequence using the 3-gram language <lb/>model. <lb/>Both male and female acoustic models are used and decoding is performed independently for each <lb/>model except for the common beam pruning in every frame. Recognition results by male and female <lb/>acoustic models are compared and the one with better score is used as the result. Gender-dependent <lb/>models improve the recognition accuracy while curbing the increase of the computational amount by <lb/>common beam pruning. <lb/> 4.2. Text Retrieval Module <lb/> All the techniques described in Section 3.2 are implemented on the text retrieval module in the <lb/>system. We fixed the constants as follows according to the preliminary experiments using query <lb/>samples developed for training the LM: <lb/> 3 <lb/>. <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>3 <lb/>. <lb/>1 <lb/>, <lb/>3 <lb/>. <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>1000 <lb/>, <lb/>100 <lb/> aux <lb/>wp <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> k <lb/> k <lb/>b <lb/>k <lb/>k <lb/> We developed the synonym dictionary with about 500 entries to converge synonymous expressions <lb/>used to describe cellular phone functions. <lb/>

			5. Evaluation <lb/> In order to evaluate the usefulness of our system, we have composed 150 new queries independently <lb/>of the query corpus used for configuring the system. We have used 110 queries for evaluation, <lb/>eliminating 40 queries without relevant passages in the manual. Table 2 shows some examples of the <lb/>queries used for the evaluation. Each query contains 3.8 words in average. <lb/>The retrieval success rate, which we adopted as a criterion, measures how well the system is able to <lb/>provide a relevant passage within the top predefined number of result passages. We have calculated <lb/>the retrieval success rates at 1, 5, and 10 passages for several conditions. <lb/>In order to discuss the effect of each technique presented in Section 3.2, we first present the result <lb/>for transcriptions of the queries among the following text retrieval methods. <lb/>Method BL: This is the baseline method with no techniques applied. <lb/>Method WP: This method utilizes word pairs with dependency relations. <lb/>Method WP+AUX: This method distinguishes between the negative and the affirmative phrases by <lb/>auxiliary verbs in addition to the method WP. <lb/>Method ALL: This method converges synonyms in addition to the method WP+AUX. This is the <lb/>same condition as the prototype system. <lb/>Table 3 summarizes the result. The result shows each of the three techniques has contributed to <lb/>the improvement of the retrieval success rate. Especially, converging synonyms enhances the <lb/>performance as derived from the difference between methods WP+AUX and ALL. <lb/> Table 2: Examples of queries used for evaluation. <lb/> Shashin-o mêru-de okuritai <lb/> (I want to send a picture via email) <lb/> Aikon-o desukutoppu-ni tôroku shitai <lb/> (I want to register a new icon on the desktop) <lb/> Jushin-shita mêru-o minagara henshin mêru-o sakusei-suru hôhô <lb/> (How to write a reply mail while looking at the incoming mail) <lb/> Table 3: The retrieval success rate for the transcriptions of queries. <lb/>Retrieval Success Rate for Transcriptions <lb/>Number of <lb/>Result <lb/>Passages <lb/>BL <lb/>WP <lb/>WP+AUX <lb/>ALL <lb/>1 <lb/>40.0% <lb/>42.7% <lb/>44.5% <lb/>49.1% <lb/>5 <lb/>65.5% <lb/>69.1% <lb/>70.0% <lb/>77.3% <lb/>10 <lb/>73.6% <lb/>73.6% <lb/>74.5% <lb/>87.3% <lb/> Table 4: The retrieval success rate for the utterances of queries. <lb/>Number of <lb/>Result Passages <lb/>Retrieval Success Rate <lb/>for Utterances <lb/>1 <lb/>44.3% <lb/>5 <lb/>72.5% <lb/>10 <lb/>81.4% <lb/> Next we present the performance of the total system. Table 4 shows the result for 660 utterances <lb/>of the queries by 18 speakers where the LVCSR module and the text retrieval module in the <lb/>prototype system are used. The retrieval success rates for utterances are almost the same as those <lb/>for transcription. Since the cellular phones used in this system can display about 10 lines on the <lb/>average, the 10th retrieval rate represents the rate of successfully delivering the passage requested by <lb/>the user. The result shows that the system designed for cellular phone user&apos;s manual was able to <lb/>direct user to appropriate information at 81.4%, which is sufficient for practical use. <lb/> 6. Conclusions <lb/> In this paper, we presented a voice query retrieval system in Japanese applied to document search on <lb/>user&apos;s manual for cellular phones with Web access capability. The system recognizes user&apos;s naturally <lb/>spoken queries over the cellular phone by LVCSR and retrieves the relevant passages by text <lb/>retrieval and then provides the output on the cellular phone screen. In order to improve the <lb/>performance for spoken short queries, we apply three techniques into text retrieval: 1) utilizing word <lb/>pairs with dependency relations, 2) distinguishing affirmative and negative expressions, and 3) <lb/>converging synonyms. With respect to LVCSR for speech over the cellular phone, we adopt <lb/>acoustic and language models derived from a query corpus for the target user&apos;s manual. The <lb/>evaluation on the system designed for cellular phone user&apos;s manual shows that the system is able to <lb/>direct users to appropriate data at 81.4% of the time, if the matching passage exists in the manual. <lb/>Our next step is to apply this system to different contents such as travelers&apos; guide and customer <lb/>surveys. We plan to clarify the problems for different contents and to enhance the portability of this <lb/>system. <lb/></body>
