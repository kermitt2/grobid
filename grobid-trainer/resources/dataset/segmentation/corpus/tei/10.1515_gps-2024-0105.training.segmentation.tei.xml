        <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Carbon emission reduction has become a worldwide <lb/>consensus for future sustainable development. Current <lb/>compressor-based active air conditioning relies on electric-<lb/>ity for operation and may contribute around 30 % of total <lb/>electricity consumption [1], [2], rendering it a major carbon <lb/>emission source in urban regimes [3]. Thus, cooling tech-<lb/>nologies [4]-[6] that require less to net-zero energy con-<lb/>sumption have been actively sought out and investigated <lb/>in recent decades. Radiative cooling is an emerging eco-<lb/>friendly cooling approach requiring zero energy input. It <lb/>achieves cooling by emitting thermal radiation in the atmo-<lb/>spheric windows (normally within the 8-13 μm wavelength <lb/>range) [7], [8] to the higher sky and preventing further heat <lb/>generation by reflecting solar irradiation. Various radia-<lb/>tive cooling coatings have been developed over the recent <lb/>years and succeeded in cooling to sub-ambient tempera-<lb/>tures [9]-[23], such as inorganic particles dispersion [9], <lb/>[10], porous polymers [11]-[13], micro-structures [14], and <lb/>nano-fabricated layered structures [15]-[18]. Among the dif-<lb/>ferent cooling coatings, radiative cooling paints are widely <lb/>considered one of the most cost-effective and scalable solu-<lb/>tions, which can be potentially applied in diverse scenarios <lb/>including buildings, textiles, chemical storage, and other <lb/>outdoor facilities, owing to their merits such as low cost, <lb/>high throughput production, and easy implementation. Var-<lb/>ious cooling paints that used calcium phosphate [19], sili-<lb/>con oxide beads [20], and other fillers [9], [21]-[28] have <lb/>shown high solar reflectivity and excellent sub-ambient <lb/>cooling performance. While they show that radiative cool-<lb/>ing by paint is possible, certain issues arise. First, the paints <lb/>reported in the literature generally need a large thickness <lb/>ranging from 300 to 500 μm to achieve high solar reflectance <lb/>[19], [24], [29]. This can lead to significant weight bearing on <lb/></body>

        <body>the substrate of interest, high cost to paint and maintain, <lb/>and over-insulation for heat dissipation from the buildings. <lb/>Meanwhile, most of the reported cooling paints are based on <lb/>volatile and flammable organic solvents such as toluene and <lb/>dimethylformamide (DMF). They may raise concerns about <lb/>operation/storage safety, odor, and health hazards including <lb/>volatile organic compounds (VOC) emission. Non-toxic and <lb/>eco-friendly aqueous cooling paints of high performance <lb/>and low mass loading are thus highly desirable for practical <lb/>applications [30]-[32]. <lb/>This work proposes a double-layer structure that <lb/>exploits a complementary spectrum strategy to reduce the <lb/>thickness of a painted coating while maintaining good <lb/>radiative cooling performance. This structure consists of a <lb/>top layer that strongly reflects UV radiation and a bottom <lb/>layer that mainly scatters the visible and NIR light, thus <lb/>realizing near-perfect full solar spectrum reflection with a <lb/>small thickness down to 150 μm. To optimize the design, <lb/>Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to determine the <lb/>key parameters that influence the scatterings in different <lb/>wavelength regimes for minimizing the coating thickness. <lb/>An aqueous Y 2 O 3 -ZnO double-layer paint is then developed, <lb/>which shows a high solar reflectance of 95.4 % and a thermal <lb/>emissivity of 0.93 with a total thickness of 150 μm. Field tests <lb/>of the developed ultrathin paint were conducted in summer <lb/>in Hong Kong, a coastal city with a hot humid sub-tropic cli-<lb/>mate, demonstrating a sub-ambient cooling of 2 • C at noon <lb/>and 4 • C at night without convection cover. The paint also <lb/>shows good hydrophobicity, strong adhesion, and excellent <lb/>durability such as high UV and water resistance, which <lb/>are critical for practical large-scale applications. We further <lb/>demonstrated that this design strategy can be extended for <lb/>the development of other thin radiative cooling paints such <lb/>as Y 2 O 3 -TiO 2 paints. <lb/>2 Design and modelling <lb/>Cooling paints reported in the literature are often a single-<lb/>layer design, which consists of white pigments (or fillers) <lb/>and other additives embedded in a resin matrix. These <lb/>paints rely on the multiple scatterings by the microparticles <lb/>or pores in the matrix, which can hardly be optimized to <lb/>produce superior scattering efficiency throughout the entire <lb/>solar spectrum and thus generally need a large thickness <lb/>(∼400-500 μm) to achieve a high solar reflectance. There-<lb/>fore, the thickness of paint coating can be reduced by adopt-<lb/>ing a multilayer design, in which different layers may be <lb/>optimized for targeted irradiation regimes. On the other <lb/>hand, the number of layers should not be too many consid-<lb/>ering the cost and easiness in large-scale implementation. <lb/>Figure 1: Schematic of double-layer paint structure and its working <lb/>principle. <lb/>Figure 1 shows the schematic of the double-layer design, in <lb/>which two different layers are used to scatter solar radia-<lb/>tion in different wavelength regimes. As UV light, with its <lb/>short wavelength, normally has a much smaller penetration <lb/>depth than visible and near-infrared radiation, it is a nat-<lb/>ural idea to first scatter the UV radiation and some short-<lb/>wavelength visible light using a wide-bandgap material as <lb/>the top layer while the other layer to reflect visible light and <lb/>near-infrared radiation. <lb/>To study the effects of different parameters of the <lb/>double-layer painted film and achieve the optimal design, <lb/>numerical simulations were conducted by combining the <lb/>Mie theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Mie scattering <lb/>[44] is the main scattering mechanism being considered for <lb/>cooling paints as the sizes of the particles are normally com-<lb/>parable with the solar radiation wavelength (0.25-3 μm) <lb/>while the Rayleigh scattering starts to play a role when the <lb/>particle sizes are much smaller than the light wavelength. <lb/>The Lorentz-Mie theory models the interactions between <lb/>the light of a wavelength 𝜆 and a spherical particle of a <lb/>diameter d and a complex refractive index of m + ki by a set <lb/>of governing equations. In this study, we adopt the approach <lb/>from Bohren [33], where the complex refractive index of <lb/>the particle is normalized by the index of the matrix. How-<lb/>ever, the corresponding governing equations of Mie scat-<lb/>tering are often formulated for a single particle, and they <lb/>need to be adjusted for a group of particles when studying <lb/>paints. <lb/>The open-source code by Maetzler [34] is used to cal-<lb/>culate the Mie scattering properties by a group of particles <lb/>[35], [36], including the effective scattering efficiency (𝜎 T ), <lb/>effective absorbing efficiency (𝜅 T ) and effective asymmetric <lb/>factor (g T ), as shown in Equations (1)-(3), where c is the <lb/></body>

These events <lb/>occur according to the values of scattering and absorption <lb/>efficiencies from Mie scattering theory [37], [38], and the <lb/>effective complex refractive index of the composite from <lb/>effective medium theory [39]. The Monte Carlo simulation <lb/>was conducted using an open-source code called Monte <lb/>Carlo for multi-layer media by Wang et al. [40]. 500,000 <lb/>photons were emitted into the paint film at a selected wave-<lb/>length value. In total, 451 wavelength values are uniformly <lb/>sampled from 250 nm to 2500 nm. The statistical results <lb/>were then used to determine the reflectance, absorptance, <lb/>and transmittance spectra. Because of the high concen-<lb/>tration of the particles, a dependent scattering correction <lb/>was implemented to improve accuracy [41]. More details <lb/>can be found in studies by Li et al. and Peoples et al. [29], <lb/>[36]. The simulation and calculation process are shown <lb/>in Figure 2a. <lb/>A 50 μm thick paint film was first selected for the Monte <lb/>Carlo simulation, which consists of an acrylic resin matrix <lb/>with a refractive index of 1.49 and filler particles of differ-<lb/>ent refractive indexes. The volume concentration of the fill <lb/>material is set at 50 % and the particle size of the material <lb/>is 800 nm. When the refractive indexes of the filler par-<lb/>ticles are 1.00, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, and 2.50, the corresponding <lb/>reflectance of the film is 87.7 %, 67.3 %, 84.5 %, 90.4 %, and <lb/>92.3 %, respectively. Apparently, for the same matrix and <lb/>filler size, increasing the refractive index contrast between <lb/>the particles and the matrix can improve the reflectance. <lb/>For example, a 37 % increase in reflectance can be achieved <lb/>when changing the refractive index from 1.75 to 2.5. A 30 % <lb/>increase in reflectance can also be achieved when changing <lb/>the refractive index from 1.75 to 1.00, showing air pores <lb/>to be efficient in scattering light (Figure 2b). On the other <lb/>hand, Figure 2c shows that to achieve the same reflectance, <lb/>a larger refractive index contrast can lead to much-reduced <lb/>Figure 2: Simulation and calculations.

        <body>thickness. For example, to achieve the same reflectance of <lb/>92 %, the required film thickness can be reduced by 87.5 % <lb/>when increasing the refractive index from 1.75 to 2.5. Thus, <lb/>selecting fillers with a higher refractive index is critical for <lb/>reducing the thickness of a painted film. <lb/>Common materials that have high refractive indexes <lb/>and are widely used in white paints are titanium dioxide <lb/>and zinc oxide due to their white appearance. However, <lb/>these materials have their drawbacks since they also have <lb/>an intrinsic nature to absorb UV radiation which can pre-<lb/>vent effective radiative cooling. This absorption comes from <lb/>their relatively narrow band gaps of around 3 eV so that <lb/>the corresponding paints generally show reflectance below <lb/>92 % [36]. Thus, we propose to adopt two different filler <lb/>materials that can target different regions of the solar spec-<lb/>trum based on their refractive indices. Y 2 O 3 was chosen to <lb/>be the top layer of the double-layer structure because of its <lb/>relatively high refractive index of approximately ∼2.0 in the <lb/>UV regime [42] to achieve strong UV scattering and a wide <lb/>band gap of 5.5 eV [43] to avoid UV absorption. ZnO with a <lb/>band gap of around 3.4 eV was chosen for the bottom layer <lb/>for its high refractive index of ∼2.1 in the visible and NIR <lb/>regimes, which can lead to strong scattering in visible and <lb/>NIR light. <lb/>The scattering efficiency depends on the intrinsic opti-<lb/>cal properties of the filler materials as well as the parti-<lb/>cle size. The scattering efficiencies are shown in Figure 2d. <lb/>Figure 2d shows that the scattering efficiency peaks in dif-<lb/>ferent wavelength regimes for particles of different sizes, <lb/>indicating that a wide distribution of particle size is bene-<lb/>ficial to scatter light throughout the wide spectrum. This is <lb/>also supported by a study by Peoples [36]. According to the <lb/>Mie scattering results shown in Figure 2d, Y 2 O 3 particles of a <lb/>size between 300 and 800 nm show the highest efficiency in <lb/>the UV region while ZnO particles of a size of 800-1200 nm <lb/>show the highest scattering performance in the visible range <lb/>and NIR regimes. The average scattering efficiency was <lb/>also calculated by taking the weighted average of the solar <lb/>spectrum shown in Figure S1. The Y 2 O 3 particles with sizes <lb/>ranging from 500 to 800 nm show the highest scattering <lb/>efficiency in the UV region, while ZnO particles ranging from <lb/>800 to 1200 nm have the highest scattering efficiency in the <lb/>visible regime. Based on these calculations, powders from <lb/>different vendors were tested to select the optimal sizes of <lb/>Y 2 O 3 and ZnO particles. Simulations were further conducted <lb/>based on the actual distribution of particle sizes. The vol-<lb/>ume concentrations of particles were determined by Monte <lb/>Carlo simulations at a set thickness of 50 μm. The volume <lb/>concentration was varied from 50 % to 65 % as shown in <lb/>Figure S2. For the Y 2 O 3 paint, the reflectance increases from <lb/>83.1 % to 85.3 % as the concentration increases while for the <lb/>ZnO paint, the reflectance increases from 82.0 % to 83.8 %. <lb/>Although the simulations suggest the values of the volume <lb/>concentration of the paints, the volume concentration of <lb/>Y 2 O 3 was set to 55 % and ZnO to 60 % because tests showed <lb/>that a too-high volume concentration could cause difficul-<lb/>ties such as cracking and low adhesion in fabrication. <lb/>The optical properties of different double-layer designs <lb/>were simulated by the Monte Carlo simulations and the <lb/>results are shown in Figure 2e and f. The purpose is to <lb/>study the effects of the top and bottom layer thicknesses <lb/>and to optimize the design while keeping the film no thicker <lb/>than 200 μm and with a predetermined volume of Y 2 O 3 <lb/>and ZnO paint of 55 % and 60 %, respectively. The top layer <lb/>thicknesses of 25 μm, 50 μm, and 100 μm were chosen for <lb/>illustration while maintaining a thickness of 100 μm for <lb/>the bottom layer. From Figure 1e, increasing the top layer <lb/>thickness mainly improves the UV reflectance while the <lb/>reflectance in the NIR region is also enhanced. The over-<lb/>all solar reflectance improves from 93.5 % to 95.7 % when <lb/>the top layer thickness increases from 25 μm to 100 μm. <lb/>Then, the top layer thickness was set as 50 μm while the <lb/>bottom layer was set to be 50 μm, 100 μm, and 150 μm. The <lb/>reflectance increases over the entire visible and NIR spectra <lb/>when the bottom layer is thicker, as shown in Figure 1f. <lb/>However, the UV reflectance remains constant, indicating <lb/>the dominant contribution of the top layer in scattering UV. <lb/>To achieve both a high solar reflectance and a low overall <lb/>thickness, a paint structure with a 50-μm Y 2 O 3 top layer and <lb/>100-μm ZnO bottom layer was selected, with a simulated <lb/>reflectance of ∼95 %. <lb/>3 Fabrication and characterization <lb/>From the above simulations, the optimal average parti-<lb/>cle size for the Y 2 O 3 top layer should be in the range <lb/>of 300-500 nm, and that for the ZnO bottom layer is <lb/>800-1000 nm. Y 2 O 3 and ZnO powders from different ven-<lb/>dors were tested for the particle sizes and the powders <lb/>that were purchased from Hebei Badu Metal Materials Co., <lb/>Ltd showed the best match for the optimal particle sizes. <lb/>Figure 3a shows the fabrication process of the double-layer <lb/>coating. First, acrylic resin (Xuzhou Lvyuan Chemical Co., <lb/>Ltd) and the fillers (Y 2 O 3 or ZnO particles in this work) <lb/>with simulated volume concentration (55 % for Y 2 O 3 and <lb/>60 % for ZnO in this work) are mixed. Water with the same <lb/>amount as the resin is added to the mixture and the solution <lb/>is stirred using a homogenizer. The bottom ZnO layer and <lb/>the top Y 2 O 3 layer were applied in sequence onto a 1-mm-<lb/>thick aluminum substrate by multiple times coating with <lb/></body>

        <body>peak distribution near 800 nm. The SEM images of the <lb/>Y 2 O 3 and ZnO layers also reveal that the layers are porous <lb/>structures while the top layer is denser, which may lead to <lb/>some discrepancies between the simulation and experimen-<lb/>tal results. From the SEM of the cross-section of the mul-<lb/>tilayer paint, the thickness is approximately 141 μm with <lb/>a clear separation of the two layers. Figure 3h shows the <lb/>energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results, which <lb/>verify the distinct separation of the ZnO and Y 2 O 3 lay-<lb/>ers. Figure 3i compares the reflectance spectra of differ-<lb/>ent paints from 250 to 2500 nm, which were measured <lb/>with a UV-visible-near-infrared spectrometer (Perkin Elmer <lb/>Lambda 1050+). The 150-μm-thick double-layer paint shows <lb/>a solar reflectance of 95.4 % which is much higher than that <lb/>of 79.1 % of a typical commercial heat-reflecting paint based <lb/>on TiO 2 (Beijing Zhisheng Weihua Technology Co., Ltd.). The <lb/>simulated reflectance spectra are similar to the measured <lb/>results of the double-layered paint, verifying the reliability <lb/>of the simulation results. The double-layered paint was also <lb/>compared with Y 2 O 3 and ZnO monolayer paints with the <lb/>same thickness of 150 μm. The Y 2 O 3 and ZnO monolayer <lb/>paints show reflectances of 89.8 % and 90.8 % respectively, <lb/>both of which are lower than that of the double-layer struc-<lb/>ture (95.4 %). This indicates the synergetic effects of the Y 2 O 3 <lb/>and ZnO layers in the double-layer design. It is also noted <lb/>that the reflectance of the 150-μm-thick double-layer paint <lb/>is very close to that of a 500-μm-thick painted film of Y 2 O 3 <lb/>(96.3 %), despite its much smaller thickness. <lb/>To clarify the relative contribution of each layer and <lb/>their interaction, the spectra of a separate 100-μm ZnO layer <lb/>and 50-μm Y 2 O 3 layer are also measured for comparison in <lb/>Figure 3j. The 100-μm ZnO layer shows a solar reflectance <lb/>of 89.2 % while that of the 50-μm Y 2 O 3 layer is 82.7 %. It <lb/>is noted that the ZnO layer has a very high reflectance in <lb/>the visible light and near-infrared regimes, but it shows <lb/>high absorption in the UV regime (&lt;400 nm), which limits <lb/>its overall solar reflectance. In contrast, the 50-μm Y 2 O 3 <lb/>layer demonstrates a high solar reflectance below 400 nm, <lb/>although the reflectance above 400 nm is generally less than <lb/>that of the ZnO layer. The complementary spectra of these <lb/>two layers enable the double-layer design, i.e., the UV light <lb/>can be mainly reflected by the Y 2 O 3 layer while the light <lb/>in the visible and near-infrared regimes can be mainly <lb/>reflected by the ZnO layer. The measured thermal emissivi-<lb/>ties of the 50-μm Y 2 O 3 paint, 100-μm ZnO paint, and 150-μm <lb/>double-layer paint are 0.92, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively, in <lb/>the atmospheric window. From Figure 3g, it can be seen <lb/>that the emissivity of the double-layer paint seems to be <lb/>mainly contributed by the top Y 2 O 3 paint layer as its ther-<lb/>mal emission spectrum is almost the same as that of 50-μm <lb/>Y 2 O 3 paint but quite different from that of the separate ZnO <lb/>layer. Further studies are shown in the higher thickness of <lb/>the Y 2 O 3 and ZnO paint in Figure S4a. In addition, another <lb/>type of double-layer paint was fabricated with the same <lb/>method but with TiO 2 as the bottom layer and the test also <lb/>shows improved performance (Figure S4b) similar to those <lb/>of Y 2 O 3 -ZnO paints, implying that this design can adopt <lb/>different white high-refractive-index fillers for the bottom <lb/>layer. <lb/>4 Field tests <lb/>To evaluate the cooling performance of the cooling paint, <lb/>field tests were conducted on sunny summer days on the <lb/>roof of a building in HKUST (Figure 4b), Hong Kong dur-<lb/>ing 2-3 August 2023. The samples were painted using a <lb/>brush to the required thickness after drying on 10 × 10 cm <lb/>aluminium plates. The painted samples were then directly <lb/>placed on a white polystyrene foam cube (30 × 30 × 30 cm) <lb/>with a low thermal conductivity (∼0.03 W/mK) to prevent <lb/>heat transfer from the edge and backside, as shown in <lb/>Figure 4a. Note that we adopted the &quot;roof cooling mode&quot;, <lb/>i.e., no convention cover was used during the test to show <lb/>its performance in practical applications. To further ther-<lb/>mally isolate the samples, a commercial radiative cooling <lb/>film with 93 % solar reflectance was placed around the sam-<lb/>ples to reduce the solar absorption by the adjacent foam <lb/>surface. The plate temperature was measured continuously <lb/>by a T-type thermocouple attached to the backside of the <lb/>sample. A calibrated commercial weather station was used <lb/>to record the real-time weather data, including solar irra-<lb/>diation, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and wind <lb/>speed. The data collected from the weather station are in <lb/>good agreement with the data from the HKUST Air Quality <lb/>Research Supersite Facility shown in Figure S5d-f. <lb/>The weather station showed a peak solar irradiation of <lb/>∼950 W/m 2 at noon and the highest air temperature of 34 • C <lb/>appeared at around 3:00 pm. The average relative humid-<lb/>ity was 60 % during the daytime and 90 % at nighttime. <lb/>Figure 4c shows the real-time temperatures of the ambient <lb/>air, 150-μm double-layer paint, and 500 μm Y 2 O 3 paint. Both <lb/>paints were able to maintain a sub-ambient temperature <lb/>throughout the field-testing period. Both paints achieved a <lb/>sub-ambient cooling temperature of ∼2 • C when the ambi-<lb/>ent air temperature was the highest and ∼4 • C during the <lb/>night. This test shows that the 150-μm double-layer paint has <lb/>comparable performance with the 500-μm Y 2 O 3 paint even <lb/>at a much smaller thickness. <lb/>Other than the cooling temperature, the cooling power <lb/>of the sample was also measured by the setup shown <lb/></body>

(e) Cooling power versus ambient temper-<lb/>ature throughout the field test. (f) Calculated daytime cooling power at various surface temperature in different climate regions. <lb/>in Figure 4a on the same day of the field test. An elec-<lb/>tric heater was attached to the backside of the plate, of <lb/>which the temperature was monitored by a thermocouple. <lb/>Another shaded thermocouple was used to measure the <lb/>ambient air temperature. The measured temperature differ-<lb/>ence was input to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) <lb/>controller to control the heating power of the heater to <lb/>match the sample&apos;s temperature to the ambient tempera-<lb/>ture. The cooling power was then obtained from the heating <lb/>power of the heater according to the first law of thermody-<lb/>namics, which is displayed in Figure 4e. The highest cooling <lb/>power of ∼50 W/m 2 was achieved at night while around <lb/>10 W/m 2 when the air temperature was highest. <lb/>The cooling performance of a radiative cooler will vary <lb/>under different climates, depending on solar irradiation, <lb/>humidity, wind speed, and cloud coverage. To assess the <lb/>cooling capability of the double-layer paint in different cli-<lb/>mates, we calculated the cooling power and cooling temper-<lb/>ature at 300 K during daytime in three different climates <lb/>using Equation (4). The atmospheric conditions are set in <lb/>the Sub-arctic, mid-latitude, and tropical areas provided by <lb/>MODTRAN during the summer. The non-radiative heat loss <lb/>(P nrad ) was assumed to be zero. The solar radiation (P sun ) is <lb/>also set to be 1000 W/m 2 in the daytime with the ambient <lb/>temperature set at 300 K. The results are shown in Figure 4f. <lb/>The figure shows that different climates affect the cooling <lb/>potential of the radiative cooler performance. The perfor-<lb/>mance is the lowest in the Tropical climate but highest in <lb/>the sub-artic climates. During the daytime, the equilibrium <lb/>cooling powers are 60.5 W/m 2 , 39.0 W/m 2 , and 20.5 W/m 2 <lb/>during the nighttime. This shows the different climates can <lb/>have approximately 20 W/m 2 difference between each cli-<lb/>mate. This is due to the relative humidity of each climate <lb/>affecting the transparency of the atmospheric window [44]. <lb/>Sub-arctic regions have the lowest relative humidity and <lb/>tropical regions have the highest while the mid latitude is <lb/>between the two. <lb/>P cooling = P rad -P sun -P atm -P nrad <lb/>(4) <lb/>5 Durability test <lb/>Most organic materials including paints tend to degrade <lb/>under UV irradiation or moisture, which may limit their <lb/>lifetime and cooling performance in long-term applications <lb/>[45]. To test the UV resilience of the paint, an accelerated UV <lb/>durability test was conducted with a 40-W UV test chamber <lb/>with a UV radiation intensity equivalent to that in the stan-<lb/>dard 1-sun irradiation. The optical properties of the painted <lb/>samples before and after the UV test are shown in Figure 5a, <lb/>illustrating negligible change in the reflectance spectrum. <lb/>The total solar reflectance before the UV test was 94.8 % <lb/>while that after the UV test was 94.9 % after 16 weeks of day-<lb/>time UV exposure. The variation may be due to the uncer-<lb/>tainties in the spectrometer. During practical applications, <lb/></body>

(c) Comparison of reflectance of double layer paint and commercial paint before and after soiling test. (d) Comparison of soiling test of <lb/>commercial paint and radiative cooling paint. (e) Adhesion test. <lb/>moisture may cause the degradation of the cooling perfor-<lb/>mance of the coating, especially when water is absorbed <lb/>or trapped in the coating structure. To test the resistance <lb/>to water, a paint sample was submerged in water for five <lb/>days and then dried. Its optical properties were measured <lb/>before and after the test, as shown in Figure 5b. The total <lb/>solar reflectance before the test is 94.2 % and 94.4 % after <lb/>the test, showing good water resistance. <lb/>The soiling test was conducted by mixing carbon black <lb/>powder with water at a concentration of 0.03 g of powder <lb/>per 1 L of water, as performed by a study by Song [27]. <lb/>The mixture was then dropped on the painted samples and <lb/>heated. The samples were then washed, and the reflectance <lb/>spectra were compared. Figure 5d shows the result of the <lb/>soiling testing of the commercial white paint and the radia-<lb/>tive cooling paint. Due to the higher hydrophobicity of <lb/>the radiative cooling paint, the carbon black dust can be <lb/>easily washed away while the commercial paint had large <lb/>spots of carbon black. Their reflectance spectra were also <lb/>measured and shown in Figure 5c. The solar reflectance <lb/>of the commercial paint decreased from 79.1 % to 65.1 % <lb/>after the soiling test while the double-layer paint showed <lb/>a higher resistance, only showing a 3.5 % reduction in the <lb/>solar reflectance. To test the stability over time, a sample of <lb/>Y 2 O 3 painted film of 500 μm that was exposed to air at room <lb/>temperature for more than a half year was tested multiple <lb/>times with the UV-vis spectrometer. It was observed that <lb/>there was negligible variation in the reflectance spectra of <lb/>the film (Figure S6), which showed a solar reflectance of <lb/>96.1 % at the beginning and 96.0 % after half a year. <lb/>A good paint must be able to adhere to a surface well <lb/>and will not peel off easily. The standard cross-cut tape test <lb/>according to the ISO2409-2020 standard was conducted, in <lb/>which a tool was used to scratch grids on the painted film <lb/>and then a standard tape was then placed on the grid and <lb/>peeled off the film. Figure 5e shows there was little to no <lb/>paint peeling off after the test, indicating that the paint has <lb/>a high grade of adhesion ISO1 to the surface. <lb/>6 Conclusions <lb/>We have reported a double-layer design to produce a thin <lb/>radiative cooling painted film with a high solar reflectance <lb/>by utilizing a multilayer structure painted film. The struc-<lb/>ture and the performance of the painted film were stud-<lb/>ied by numerical simulations and experiments. The 150-um <lb/>painted film was able to have a 95.2 % reflectance and 0.93 <lb/>emissivity which is the same as a Y 2 O 3 paint of 500 um <lb/>thickness, showing significant thickness reduction by the <lb/>design. From the field test, the painted film was able to <lb/>maintain a cooling temperature of 2 • C at noon time and 4 • C <lb/>at nighttime. The cooling power was also recorded through <lb/>field testing, resulting in a peak cooling power of 50 W/m 2 at <lb/>nighttime and 10 W/m 2 during the daytime. The painted film <lb/>also illustrates good hydrophobicity, high adhesion strength, <lb/></body>
