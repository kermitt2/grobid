However, grazing <lb/>is the only mortality process considered by the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of dilution method <lb/>experiments. We show an alternative interpretation arises when there is concurrent niche competition within the <lb/>plankton community. We find that grazing rates may be overestimated -the degree of overestimation is related to <lb/>the importance of niche competition relative to zooplankton grazing. Thus, we propose a modification to the dilution <lb/>method to disentangle the effects of niche competition and zooplankton grazing. Our theoretical results suggest <lb/>the revised &quot;Z-dilution&quot; method can robustly infer grazing mortality, regardless of the dominant plankton mortality <lb/>driver. Further, we show it is possible to independently estimate both grazing mortality and niche competition <lb/>when the classical and Z-dilution methods are used in tandem. We discuss the significance of these results for <lb/>quantifying plankton mortality rates. <lb/>Key words: <lb/>dilution method, mortality rates, zooplankton, plankton, niche competition, Z-dilution <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Plankton are responsible for primary productivity in the oceans, form the base of the ocean food web, and are <lb/>drivers of major ocean biogeochemical cycles. Zooplankton grazing is thought to be one of the dominant drivers <lb/>of plankton mortality (Sherr and Sherr, 2002; Calbet and Landry, 2004); and is a core process within the marine <lb/>microbial loop (Azam et al., 1983; Turner, 2015). However, other processes such as nutrient limitation, sinking <lb/>and viral lysis compete and interact with grazers as sources of plankton mortality (Barbeau et al., 1996; Kirchman, <lb/>2010; Weitz and Wilhelm, 2012; Brum et al., 2014). Understanding the dynamics of microbial food webs is therefore <lb/>key to understanding their role in oceanic biogeochemical fluxes (Falkowski et al., 1998; Follows et al., 2007; Lima-<lb/>Mendez et al., 2015). <lb/>Estimates of the relative importance of grazing versus other mortality drivers depends on the quality and robust-<lb/>ness of experimental techniques. The dilution method (Landry and Hassett, 1982) is a long-established and popu-<lb/>lar technique used to measure the impact of micro-and nano-zooplankton on plankton communities. The method <lb/>is outlined in Figure 1. A sample of seawater is taken and prefiltered so only the microbial fraction remains. Some <lb/>of this whole seawater (WSW) sample is further filtered, to remove plankton and zooplankton, creating a diluent. <lb/>The dilution method procedure creates a series of bottles each containing a different proportion of WSW mixed <lb/>with diluent to create a dilution series. <lb/>By measuring the differences in plankton population sizes between two time points within each bottle, the cor-<lb/>responding approximate per capita growth rates can be calculated. The dilution curve represents a plot of the <lb/>approximate growth rates within each bottle against the dilution level (the proportion of WSW within a bottle). The <lb/>plankton growth rate and the grazing rate are reported as the intercept and slope, respectively, of the dilution curve. <lb/>This is due to the underlying theoretical model of plankton dynamics presumed to operate in the bottle. This model <lb/>introduced by Landry and Hasset is: <lb/>dP <lb/>dt <lb/>= <lb/>growth <lb/>rP − <lb/>grazing <lb/>aP Z <lb/>(1) <lb/>in which P is the density of plankton, which grow at rate r; and are grazed upon by zooplankton Z at a rate of a. <lb/>Consider that the whole seawater sample initially contains a plankton density of P 0 and a zooplankton density of <lb/>Z 0 . A particular bottle within the dilution series containing a proportion F of whole seawater will initially contain <lb/>plankton and zooplankton densities of F P 0 and F Z 0 respectively. Evaluating the apparent growth rate, calculated <lb/>as the population change per capita, under these conditions shows that: <lb/>1 <lb/>P <lb/>dP <lb/>dt F P0,F Z0 <lb/>= r − (aZ 0 ) F. <lb/>(2) <lb/>Equation (2) implies that the relationship between dilution level and apparent growth rate will be linear with an <lb/>intercept equal to the intrinsic per capita growth rate and a gradient equal to the initial per capita grazing mortality <lb/>rate. However, the model given by equation (1) may be an insufficient description of bottle plankton dynamics for <lb/>several reasons. <lb/>Zooplankton grazing may respond non-linearly with respect to plankton densities in the bottle for example due to <lb/>feeding saturation. This could significantly alter the shape of the dilution curve and how grazing mortality estimates <lb/>can be made (Evans and Paranjape, 1992; Landry et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2014). Additional sources of plankton <lb/>mortality such as losses due to sinking or viral lysis (e.g. Evans et al. 2003; Kimmance and Brussaard 2010) are <lb/>not accounted for in this model, yet incorporating these processes may be important for interpreting empirical data <lb/>from dilution experiments. We also note that the model intends to describe bulk community dynamics. Diversity <lb/>is not considered as plankton and zooplankton communities are each treated as a single population, neglecting <lb/>potential important functional differences between species. Calbet and Saiz (2013) consider trophic chains; but <lb/>overall limited attention has been given to diversity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1: Schematic of the classical dilution method of Landry and Hassett. 1. Sample Environmental samples <lb/>are prefiltered to focus on microbial communities -this is termed whole seawater (WSW). Dilution method theory <lb/>assumes WSW contains zooplankton and the plankton they graze upon. 2. Filtration The classic dilution method <lb/>filters some WSW to create a diluent containing no plankton or zooplankton. 3. Dilution series A series of bottles <lb/>are filled with a proportion F of WSW and mixed with a proportion (1 − F ) of the diluent creating a dilution series. <lb/>The blue and red bars represent the relative abundance of plankton and zooplankton. Apparent growth rates are <lb/>calculated by measuring the differences in plankton population sizes in each bottle across the dilution series at two <lb/>time points (the beginning and end of an incubation period). The zooplankton grazing rate is estimated by finding <lb/>the gradient of a linear regression model between the dilution level F and the apparent growth rate. <lb/>Another critique of the method is that it does not take into account the resource requirements for plankton growth. <lb/>In the absence of zooplankton (Z 0 = 0) this model predicts the plankton population will grow without bounds to <lb/>infinity as niche competition between plankton is not considered. Subsequent modifications of the dilution method <lb/>included a nutrient enrichment step so that plankton could grow near their idealized maximum rates (Landry et al., <lb/>1995). Even if nutrients are added to bottles to attempt to keep plankton growing in the exponential growth phase, <lb/>this does not eliminate the potential of competition occurring between plankton. In this paper we focus on how the <lb/>inclusion of niche competition may alter the interpretation of dilution experiment measurements. <lb/>A common way to represent niche competition between plankton is by using a logistic growth model (Verhulst, <lb/>1845). Logistic growth is a phenomenological model used to implicitly represent competition for resources, whilst <lb/>not tracking those resources explicitly. It has long been used in mathematical ecology and has been used to <lb/>describe plankton growth dynamics (e.g. Lewis et al., 2012). Using a logistic growth function has the effect of <lb/>bounding plankton populations to a carrying capacity K. We note that the inclusion of logistic growth could be <lb/>interpreted to mean that plankton mortality increases as P approaches K or that plankton growth decreases as P <lb/>approaches K, or a combination thereof. A candidate model considering the effect of niche competition is: <lb/>dP <lb/>dt <lb/>= <lb/>logistic growth <lb/>rP 1 − <lb/>P <lb/>K <lb/>− <lb/>grazing <lb/>aP Z . <lb/>(3) <lb/>Using equation (3) as the description for plankton dynamics we find the apparent growth rate within a bottle in the <lb/>dilution series is predicted as: <lb/>1 <lb/>P <lb/>dP <lb/>dt F P0,F Z0 <lb/>= r − <lb/>rP 0 <lb/>K <lb/>+ aZ 0 F. <lb/>(4) <lb/>This model, including niche competition, also predicts a linear relationship between dilution level and apparent <lb/>growth rates. Here, the intercept of the dilution curve represents the maximum growth rate, just as in the classical <lb/></body>

			<body>model. However, the slope is now interpreted as the combined effect of niche competition and grazing, both of <lb/>which necessarily have positive signs. Therefore, dilution experiments may overestimate grazing rates should <lb/>niche competition be important. <lb/>In this manuscript we demonstrate potential limits of the performance and robustness of the classical dilution <lb/>method using in silico simulations of dilution experiments. We do so while varying the relative strength of zoo-<lb/>plankton grazing to niche competition. Next, we propose a revision to the dilution method which, in theory, should <lb/>provide robust estimates of zooplankton grazing. We discuss how the effects of niche competition and zooplankton <lb/>grazing could be estimated by using the two approaches in tandem. We close by discussing how these results <lb/>affect the interpretation and implementation of dilution method experiments. <lb/>2 Methods <lb/>For the in silico dilution experiments, whole seawater is mixed with the diluent at 10 dilution levels (with proportions <lb/>F = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 of WSW) to create a dilution series with 10 bottles. The apparent <lb/>growth rate, r , within each bottle is calculated from recordings of the simulated population dynamics as: <lb/>r = <lb/>1 <lb/>T <lb/>log <lb/>P 0 <lb/>P T <lb/>(5) <lb/>where P 0 is the plankton density at the beginning of the simulation and P T is the plankton density after time T <lb/>(Landry and Hassett, 1982). Here the apparent growth rate is calculated using an incubation time of 24h in length. <lb/>Dilution method estimates of grazing mortality are then calculated by finding the slope of the linear regression fit <lb/>of apparent growth rates within each simulated bottle in the dilution series (response) against the proportion, F , of <lb/>WSW it contains (predictor). The intercept of this regression is understood as representing plankton growth rate, <lb/>whilst the slope is interpreted as the grazing mortality rate. Model parameters for in silico dilution experiments are <lb/>shown in Table S1. <lb/>3 Results <lb/>3.1 Top-down pressure as indicator of control of plankton by grazers <lb/>In the absence of zooplankton the steady state solution for plankton population density within the bottle is P * <lb/>A = K. <lb/>Similarly, the steady state in the presence of zooplankton is P * <lb/>Z = K 1 − aZ0 <lb/>r <lb/>. Neither of these densities are <lb/>necessarily reached during the dilution experiment. Nonetheless, these densities provide a means to quantify the <lb/>relative importance of grazing. To see why, note that increasing zooplankton pressure will lead to a reduction in <lb/>P * <lb/>Z , away from P * <lb/>A . Zooplankton pressure is maximised when the per capita mortality rate due to grazing, aZ 0 , <lb/>is equal to the per capita intrinsic plankton growth rate, r . We can quantify top-down control of plankton by the <lb/>zooplankton by using δ Z as a measure of zooplankton pressure: <lb/>δ Z = 1 − <lb/>P * <lb/>Z <lb/>P * <lb/>A <lb/>= <lb/>aZ 0 <lb/>r <lb/>. <lb/>(6) <lb/>In the absence of zooplankton, all plankton mortality is driven by competition between plankton and δ Z = 0 . If <lb/>top-down zooplankton grazing were to drive steady state plankton density to half of the resource limited density <lb/>then δ Z = 0.5 . When zooplankton grazing results in the plankton population being drawn to extinction ( P * <lb/>Z = 0 <lb/>), then top-down control by zooplankton is maximised and δ Z = 1 . We use three specific levels of zooplankton <lb/>pressure (low: δ Z = 0.048 , aZ 0 = 0.002 , intermediate: δ Z = 0.48 , aZ 0 = 0.02 , high: δ Z = 0.96 , aZ 0 = 0.04 <lb/>) to highlight the performance and sensitivity of the dilution method to the dominance of zooplankton grazing as a <lb/>driver of plankton mortality. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2 Mortality rates inferred from classical dilution method experiments are sensitive to <lb/>the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down pressure <lb/>The ability of the dilution method to estimate zooplankton associated mortality rates is potentially affected by the <lb/>relative level of bottom-up (i.e., niche competition) and top-down (i.e., zooplankton) pressure. This is highlighted in <lb/>Figure 2a using simulations with the three chosen levels of zooplankton pressure. Each level of zooplankton pres-<lb/>sure corresponds to a steady state zooplankton density (see Table S1) from which a steady state plankton density, <lb/>P * , is calculated while keeping the growth rate, r, fixed at 1 per day. The grazing mortality rate was estimated <lb/>using the dilution experiment, in order to compare to the baseline mortality value aZ 0 . Estimates made using the <lb/>classical dilution method were closest to the baseline rates when zooplankton pressure was high, but substantially <lb/>higher than the expected baseline rates when zooplankton pressure was low. Mortality rate bias is calculated as <lb/>the estimated grazing mortality rate (by the dilution method) divided by the baseline grazing mortality rate. Looking <lb/>across the perceived bias in mortality rates (Figure 2b) we find that baseline mortality is overestimated by a factor <lb/>of ≈ 20 at the highlighted low zooplankton pressure, a factor of ≈ 2 at the highlighted intermediate zooplankton <lb/>pressure and by less than 5% at the highlighted high zooplankton pressure. Thus mortality rate bias is lowest <lb/>when zooplankton pressure is highest, corresponding to situations where plankton densities approach 0. This <lb/>suggests that the classical dilution method provides more accurate estimates of zooplankton associated mortality <lb/>rates when zooplankton pressure is high i.e., when grazing is significantly more important than niche competition. <lb/>Zooplankton pressure (δ Z ) <lb/>Mortality rate (d −1 <lb/>) <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Low <lb/>Intermediate <lb/>High <lb/>Baseline rate <lb/>Classical estimate <lb/>Maximum rate ( m=r ) <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>Zooplankton pressure (δ Z ) <lb/>Mortality rate bias <lb/>Classical estimate <lb/>±10% baseline rate <lb/>±25% baseline rate <lb/>Low <lb/>Intermediate <lb/>High <lb/>Figure 2: The classical dilution method may overestimate rates of mortality via grazing.

			<body>3.3 The classical dilution method is an estimator of both grazing and population growth <lb/>inhibition <lb/>Grazing mortality rates are overestimated by the classical dilution method when zooplankton pressure is low. <lb/>Indeed, the estimated grazing mortality rates appear closer to the maximum plankton growth rate (see Figure <lb/>2a). This feature of the classical dilution method arises due to the inability of the method to disentangle grazing <lb/>and niche competition as shown in equation (4). As a simple modification, we assume that the WSW sample is <lb/>dynamically at steady state; P * and Z * denoting the steady state densities in the environment. Therefore, the <lb/>initial conditions for our in silico experiments for a bottle with dilution factor F are P = F P * and Z = F Z * , where <lb/>Z * = Z 0 and P * = K 1 − aZ0 <lb/>r <lb/>. Substituting these quantities into (4) we find: <lb/>1 <lb/>P <lb/>dP <lb/>dt F P * ,F Z * <lb/>= r (1 − F ) . <lb/>(7) <lb/>In the limit when F = 0 , we find that the per capita rate of change is r ; whilst at F = 1 , the per capita rate of <lb/>change is 0. At steady state plankton growth is balanced by plankton mortality. When zooplankton pressure is <lb/>high, mortality due to grazing is much greater than mortality due to niche competition and so r ≈ aZ 0 . However, <lb/>as zooplankton pressure decreases the relative importance of mortality due to competition between plankton <lb/>increases and r is no longer a good estimate of grazing mortality. Thus, an alternative interpretation for the <lb/>slope calculated by the classical dilution method is that it represents the rate of plankton mortality by both <lb/>zooplankton grazing and by niche competition. <lb/>3.4 Diluting zooplankton alone can yield accurate grazing mortality estimates <lb/>In the classical dilution method the incubated samples contain diluted levels of both plankton and zooplankton <lb/>(Landry and Hassett, 1982). Rather than enriching the medium (see Landry et al. 1995) we propose a new <lb/>approach: altering the filter to exclude zooplankton but not plankton cells. Thus, altering the proportion of WSW <lb/>used within each treatment will only change the initial zooplankton density -representing a linear gradient between <lb/>no zooplankton and ambient levels of zooplankton; whilst maintaining ambient levels of plankton. The proposed <lb/>&quot;Z-dilution&quot; method, is depicted in Figure 3. <lb/>Figure 3: Proposed revision to the classical dilution method. Whilst the classical dilution method (see Figure 1) <lb/>uses a filter excluding plankton and zooplankton, the proposed method instead uses an alternative filter, able to <lb/>exclude zooplankton, but through which plankton can pass. Thus constituent levels of zooplankton and plankton <lb/>within each bottle, shown by red and blue bars respectively, differ to those in the classical dilution experiment. <lb/></body>

			<body>mortality rate we hope to estimate using the dilution method. This analytical result suggests this revised method <lb/>should accurately estimate grazing mortality rates, regardless of the level of zooplankton pressure. <lb/>As before, we can investigate the expected per capita growth rate in silico using the Z-dilution method under steady <lb/>state dynamics. By substituting the initial conditions for this revised dilution method, P = P * and Z = F Z * , into <lb/>equation (4) we obtain the per capita plankton rate of change as: <lb/>1 <lb/>P <lb/>dP <lb/>dt P * ,F Z * <lb/>= aZ 0 (1 − F ). <lb/>(9) <lb/>Under steady state conditions we expect the dilution curve to have a slope of aZ 0 and an intercept of aZ 0 . <lb/>3.5 Comparison of classical and revised dilution methods <lb/>We now compare the performance and robustness of the classical and Z-dilution methods. We do so by varying <lb/>the strength of zooplankton pressure. Figure 4 shows the dilution curves measured for both methods after 24h <lb/>incubation for the three highlighted conditions of zooplankton pressure. The linear regression fits for the classical <lb/>dilution method have a slope (and intercept) close to the intrinsic growth rate under all three conditions. In contrast, <lb/>the slope (and intercept) found by the Z-dilution method is closer to the identified baseline rates of zooplankton as-<lb/>sociated mortality rate. This provides confirmatory evidence to support the analytical results found in equation <lb/>and equation (9). <lb/>As a consequence, the classical and Z-dilution methods give substantially estimates of grazing mortality <lb/>rates (Figure 5).

			<body>mortality rate after a 24h incubation period. However, the ability to estimate mortality rates declines with reduced <lb/>zooplankton pressure. The classical dilution method overestimates zooplankton associated mortality. The revised <lb/>method, in which only zooplankton are subject to dilution, tends to underestimate the true rate. The degree to <lb/>which the revised method underestimates the expected rates is substantially less than that by which the classical <lb/>dilution method overestimates the expected rates. This is particularly evident when zooplankton pressure is low. <lb/>4 Discussion <lb/>Estimated zooplankton grazing rates are central to efforts to understand the relative importance of top-down vs. <lb/>bottom-up forces in the global oceans. We find that the performance of mortality rate estimates is dependent on <lb/>the filtering apparatus used by the dilution method and species life-history traits. In this paper we reviewed the <lb/>robustness of the classical dilution method and a proposed alternative, the &quot;Z-dilution&quot; method. Classical dilution <lb/>theory works well when niche competition is low relative to zooplankton grazing. But, in circumstances when <lb/>niche competition is an important control of plankton populations, we predict that the classical method will lead to <lb/>an overestimation of grazing mortality. Instead, we find that diluting zooplankton, but not plankton, represents a <lb/>feasible approach to isolate the effects of grazing from niche competition. In doing so, the method goes beyond <lb/>efforts to estimate grazing exclusively -whether in the classical dilution method or in extensions that include <lb/>enrichment (Landry and Hassett, 1982; Landry et al., 1995). <lb/>We found that the slope of the dilution curve in the classical dilution method is the combined effect of niche com-<lb/>petition and zooplankton grazing (equation (4)). Our work suggests that if equation (3) is a reasonable description <lb/>of the population dynamics within each dilution bottle, then finding the differences between the slopes (or equiva-<lb/>lently the intercepts) of the classical and the Z-dilution methods would provide a way to quantify the effects of niche <lb/>competition. We note that an alternative and complementary approach for assessing the relative impact of niche <lb/>competition could be found by measuring the differences between the slopes of the classical (Landry and Hassett, <lb/>1982) and nutrient-enriched (Landry et al., 1995) dilution experiments. If niche competition is unimportant, then <lb/>one should expect to recover the same dilution curve for the classical, the nutrient-enriched, and the Z-dilution <lb/>methods. We also note that in the Z-dilution method we assume the use of a filter that can exclude zooplankton, <lb/>but allow all plankton to pass through. In practice, it will be important to evaluate the extent to which size-or <lb/>feature-specific filtering can be achieved. <lb/>This is not the first time that the use of the dilution method has been critically assessed (e.g. Evans and Paranjape <lb/>1992; Landry et al. 1995; Agis et al. 2007; Calbet and Saiz 2013; Chen et al. 2014) or suggested to overestimate <lb/>the impact of grazing. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis found that many studies erroneously applied tests that <lb/>assessed the significance of mortality rates based on whether they were greater than or less than zero, rather than <lb/>strictly greater than zero (Latasa, 2014; Landry, 2014). Other studies have also suggested that grazing rates may <lb/>be overestimated due to changes within the grazer communities (Dolan and McKeon, 2005). Assuming grazer <lb/>communities are constant on the timescale of dilution experiments we found that zooplankton associated mortality <lb/>rates, found via the classic dilution method, may be overestimated in environments when zooplankton pressure <lb/>is low. However, we suggest that previous rate estimates made by the classical dilution method could potentially <lb/>be used as an upper bound for the true grazing mortality rate. Similarly, estimates made via nutrient-enhanced <lb/>approaches could be compared to those here as a means to gauge the relative importance of grazing with respect <lb/>to niche competition. We encourage those who use the dilution method to investigate the Z-dilution method as <lb/>a way to gain quantitative understanding of the importance of niche competition. The present analysis further <lb/>supports the need to combine theory and experiments together to improve understanding of marine microbial <lb/>ecology. <lb/></body>
