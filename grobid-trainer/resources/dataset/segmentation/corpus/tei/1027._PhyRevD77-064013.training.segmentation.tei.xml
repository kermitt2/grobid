			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Almost four decades ago, Bekenstein argued that if the <lb/>second law of thermodynamics is not to be violated in the <lb/>presence of a black hole, the black hole must possess an <lb/>entropy proportional to its horizon area [1]. The signifi-<lb/>cance of this result became clear with Hawking&apos;s demon-<lb/>stration of black-hole thermal radiation [2]. Hawking <lb/>showed that quantum effects in the background of a body <lb/>collapsing to a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) of mass M, <lb/>will lead, at late times, to a radiation of particles in all <lb/>modes of the quantum field, with a characteristic thermal <lb/>spectrum at a temperature equal to <lb/>T H <lb/>@c <lb/>k B <lb/>2 <lb/>@c 3 <lb/>Gk B <lb/>1 <lb/>8M <lb/>; <lb/>(1) <lb/>where is the surface gravity of the black-hole, G is the <lb/>four-dimensional Newton&apos;s constant, and k B is the <lb/>Boltzmann constant. Since the Hawking temperature fixes <lb/>the factor of proportionality between temperature and sur-<lb/>face gravity, one finds the Bekenstein-Hawking area law <lb/>S BH <lb/>k B <lb/>4 <lb/>A H <lb/>&apos; 2 <lb/>Pl <lb/>where &apos; Pl <lb/>G@ <lb/>c 3 <lb/>s <lb/>; <lb/>(2) <lb/>A H is the horizon area, and &apos; Pl is the four-dimensional <lb/>Planck length. All known black holes in n&gt;2 space-time <lb/>dimensions satisfy the area law (AL). <lb/>The universality of the AL has raised some important <lb/>questions that remain unanswered: what is the dynamical <lb/>mechanism that makes S BH a universal function, indepen-<lb/>dent of the black hole&apos;s past history and detailed internal <lb/>condition? Why is S BH proportional to A H ? What is the <lb/>microscopic origin of BH entropy? Are there corrections to <lb/>the entropy and if so, how generic are these corrections? <lb/>Where are the degrees of freedom, responsible for the <lb/>entropy, located? These questions often seem related, <lb/>which a correct theory of quantum gravity is expected to <lb/>address. <lb/>Naturally, there has been considerable work attempting <lb/>to address some of the above questions (for recent reviews, <lb/>see Refs. [3,4]). Broadly, there have been two approaches: <lb/>(i) associating S BH with fundamental degrees of freedom of <lb/>a microscopic theory of quantum gravity [5] and <lb/>(ii) associating S BH with quantum matter fields propagating <lb/>in a fixed BH background [6 -8]. <lb/>In this work, we focus on the second approach and, in <lb/>particular, we attribute S BH to the entanglement of the <lb/>quantum fields inside and outside the horizon. We show <lb/>that it is possible to: (a) obtain generic power-law correc-<lb/>tions to Eq. (2) which are small for large horizon radii, can <lb/>become significant for small horizons, (b) identify the <lb/>degrees of freedom that give rise to entanglement entropy, <lb/>and (c) test the robustness of Eq. (2) and its corrections for <lb/>massive quantum fields. <lb/>Consider a quantum scalar field (in a pure state) prop-<lb/>agating in the BH space-time. For an outside observer, the <lb/>BH horizon provides a boundary and (s)he can only have <lb/>information of the state restricted to outside the horizon. <lb/>Consequently, while the full state of the field is pure, the <lb/>state restricted to outside the horizon is mixed which leads <lb/>to a nonzero entropy. This entropy, aka Von Neumann <lb/>entropy, can formally be written as <lb/>S ÿk B Tr ln <lb/>(3) <lb/>where is the mixed (or reduced) density matrix. The <lb/>above microcanonical definition of entropy will be used <lb/>here. Although it is also possible to compute the entangle-<lb/>ment entropy in the canonical picture [8], its usage is <lb/>restrictive due to the fact that it implicitly assumes positive <lb/>specific heat. On the contrary, however, a Schwarzschild <lb/>BH has a negative specific heat. <lb/>About two decades ago, Bombelli et al [6] showed that <lb/>the entanglement entropy of scalar fields is proportional to <lb/></body>

			<body>A H =a 2 , where A H is the area of the boundary of the <lb/>region being traced over (the &apos;&apos;horizon&apos;&apos;), and a is the <lb/>ultraviolet cutoff at the horizon (equivalently, the lattice <lb/>spacing, when space is discretized). Identifying a with the <lb/>Planck length &apos; Pl , one recovers the Bekenstein-Hawking <lb/>AL (2). These results were later reproduced by Srednicki <lb/>[7], where by tracing over the degrees of freedom inside a <lb/>spherical surface of radius R, he showed that the entangle-<lb/>ment entropy <lb/>S <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 ; <lb/>(4) <lb/>where A 4R 2 . Thus, the area law can be considered as <lb/>a consequence of the entanglement of the quantum fields <lb/>across the horizon. 1 (An analytical proof of the area pro-<lb/>portionality has recently been given in Ref. [10]. For an <lb/>application of entanglement in stringy black holes, see <lb/>Refs. [11,12].) <lb/>Now, why is such a computation involving scalar fields <lb/>in flat space-time relevant for black holes at all? Here, we <lb/>try to provide at least a plausible answer to this question: in <lb/>Appendix A, we consider gravitational perturbations in a <lb/>black-hole background, and show that for certain modes of <lb/>these perturbations, the effective action reduces to that of a <lb/>scalar field. Further, in Appendix B, we write the corre-<lb/>sponding scalar field Hamiltonian in the black-hole back-<lb/>ground in Lemaître coordinates, and show that for a fixed <lb/>Lemaître time, it reduces to that in a flat space-time. Thus, <lb/>for time-independent quantities such as entropy, scalar <lb/>fields of the type considered here appear to play an im-<lb/>portant role. <lb/>The computation and the area proportionality of entan-<lb/>glement entropy in [6] and Srednicki [7] is based on the <lb/>simplifying assumption that the quantum field is in the <lb/>vacuum (i.e., ground) state (GS). Recently, two of the <lb/>authors (S. D. and S. Sh.) investigated the robustness of <lb/>the entanglement entropy: area-law relation by considering <lb/>nonvacuum states [13,14]. It was shown that while replac-<lb/>ing the vacuum state by a generic coherent state (GCS) or a <lb/>class of squeezed states (SS) does not affect the AL, doing <lb/>so with a class of n-particle or excited states (ES) results in <lb/>a significant deviation from the AL. More specifically, if <lb/>the scalar field is in a class of 1-particle ES, it was shown <lb/>that the entropy scales as <lb/>S <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 <lb/>; <lb/>(5) <lb/>where the power is always less than unity, and decreases <lb/>with the increase in the number of excitations [14] (see <lb/>Appendix C for details). Thus, it was shown that the <lb/>entanglement entropy does not always lead to AL and its <lb/>form crucially depends on the choice of the quantum state. <lb/>Given the above results, one may draw two distinct <lb/>conclusions: first that entanglement entropy is not ro-<lb/>bust-and reject it as a possible source of BH entropy. <lb/>Second-since entanglement entropy for ES scales as a <lb/>lower power of area -it is plausible that when a generic <lb/>state (consisting of a superposition of GS and ES) is <lb/>considered, corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking en-<lb/>tropy will emerge. In order to determine which one is <lb/>correct, it is imperative to investigate various generaliza-<lb/>tions of the scenarios considered in Refs. [6,7,14]. To this <lb/>end, in this work we calculate the entanglement entropy of <lb/>the mixed superposition of vacuum and 1-particle state <lb/>(MS). We show explicitly that the MS entanglement en-<lb/>tropy is given by <lb/>S c 0 <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 <lb/>1 c 1 fA where fA <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 <lb/>ÿ <lb/>; <lb/>(6) <lb/>c 0 , c 1 are constants of order unity, and is a fractional <lb/>power which depends on the amount of mixing. Thus, we <lb/>show that, for large horizon area (A a 2 ), the contribu-<lb/>tion of fA is negligible and the MS entanglement en-<lb/>tropy asymptotically approaches the GS entropy. This is <lb/>significantly different from the 1-particle state considered <lb/>in Ref. [14] for which the entropy always scales as power <lb/>of area, cf. Eq. (5), the power being less than unity. Thus, if <lb/>black-hole entropy is a consequence of quantum entangle-<lb/>ment, the AL is valid for large horizons, as long as the <lb/>quantum field is in a superposition of vacuum and 1-<lb/>particle states. <lb/>From a physics point of view, we expect power-law <lb/>corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the follow-<lb/>ing two reasons: (a) S BH is a semiclassical result and is <lb/>valid for large black holes, i.e. when r h &apos; Pl (r h is the <lb/>radius of the horizon). It is not clear whether the AL will be <lb/>valid for the small BHs (r h &apos; Pl ). (b) There is no reason to <lb/>expect that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy to be the <lb/>whole answer for a correct theory of quantum gravity. <lb/>For instance, it was shown by Wald [15] that if one takes <lb/>into account higher curvature corrections to the Einstein-<lb/>Hilbert action, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is the <lb/>leading term in a series expansion. <lb/>As mentioned earlier, in this paper, we also identify the <lb/>precise location of the microscopic degrees of freedom <lb/>(DOF) for the entanglement entropy of the superposition <lb/>of vacuum and 1-particle states [16]. We find that the DOF <lb/>close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy. <lb/>However, there are small contributions from the DOF far <lb/>away from the horizon as well. These far-away DOF con-<lb/>tributions are least in the case of vacuum state and increase <lb/>as the number of excitations and/or the mixing weight of 1-<lb/>particle state with vacuum state increases. Correspon-<lb/>dingly, deviations from the AL increases as well. Thus, <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 Although one recovers the area law, the divergence of the <lb/>entanglement entropy has been a puzzle. The reason for the <lb/>divergence is due to the fact that the boundary delineating the <lb/>region being traced over is sharp [9]. <lb/></note>

			<body>the corrections to the AL may, in a way, be attributed to the <lb/>far-away DOF. <lb/>Finally, we investigate the effect of massive fields on <lb/>entanglement entropy. We show that in all cases (vacuum, <lb/>1-particle, and superposed states), the massive scalar field <lb/>entanglement entropy (S m ) contains an exponential damp-<lb/>ing factor in comparison with the massless scalar field <lb/>entanglement entropy (S 0 ). The Gaussian fits of the ratio <lb/>S m =S 0 with the mass (in appropriate units) show that the <lb/>exponential factor depends explicitly on the mass squared <lb/>and hence falls off rapidly as the mass is increased. <lb/>However, there is not much variation of the fitting parame-<lb/>ters for the different -vacuum, 1-particle, and mixed-<lb/>states, even when a fairly high amount of excitation is <lb/>taken into account. This shows that the mixing proportions <lb/>in the GS and ES superposition have little influence on the <lb/>ratio S m =S 0 . We thus show that the mass overall reduces <lb/>the entropy exponentially. <lb/>The organization of this paper is as follows: In the next <lb/>section, we briefly review the procedure of obtaining the <lb/>entanglement entropy of massless scalar fields in flat <lb/>space-time. In Sec. III, we obtain the (reduced) density <lb/>matrix for the scalar field which is in a superposition of GS <lb/>and 1-particle ES. We compute the entanglement entropy <lb/>numerically for such a superposition and estimate the <lb/>corrections to the BH area law. In Sec. IV, we identify <lb/>the locations of the scalar field degrees of freedom that are <lb/>responsible for the entanglement entropy for the superpo-<lb/>sition of GS and ES. In Sec. V, we obtain the entanglement <lb/>entropy for a massive scalar field. We conclude with a <lb/>summary and open questions in Sec. VI. In Appendix A, <lb/>we discuss the motivation for considering a massless or <lb/>massive scalar field for computing the entanglement en-<lb/>tropy, and as mentioned before, we show that for certain <lb/>modes of gravitational perturbations, the relevant action <lb/>reduces to that of a scalar field. In Appendix B, we obtain <lb/>the Hamiltonian of a scalar field in a general BH space-<lb/>time. We show that this Hamiltonian in Lemaître coordi-<lb/>nates, and at a fixed Lemaître time, reduces to the scalar <lb/>field Hamiltonian in flat space-time. Thus this Hamiltonian <lb/>is relevant for the computation of time-independent quan-<lb/>tities such as entropy. In Appendix C we briefly review the <lb/>results obtained in the earlier works [6,7,14] for the ground <lb/>state and 1-particle state. <lb/>Before we proceed, a few comments on the notation we <lb/>use are in order: The metric is four-dimensional with the <lb/>signature ÿ; ; ; . We use units with k B c @ 1 <lb/>and set M 2 <lb/>Pl 1=16G. The quantum field &apos; is a mini-<lb/>mally coupled scalar field. <lb/>II. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY OF SCALAR <lb/>FIELDS <lb/>In this section, we briefly review the procedure of ob-<lb/>taining entanglement entropy for scalar fields propagating <lb/>in flat space-time. The motivation for considering scalar <lb/>fields for the entanglement entropy computations is dis-<lb/>cussed in Appendix A. The relevance of the scalar field <lb/>Hamiltonian in flat space-time for computing entropy in a <lb/>black-hole space-time is discussed in Appendix B. <lb/>The Hamiltonian of a massless scalar field propagating <lb/>in flat space-time is given by Eq. (B15). In order to obtain <lb/>the entropy, we need to discretize this Hamiltonian on the <lb/>radial lattice with lattice spacing a. Discretizing the <lb/>Hamiltonian such that r ! r i ; r i1 ÿ r i a and L <lb/>N 1a is the infrared cutoff, 2 we get <lb/>H lm <lb/>1 <lb/>2a <lb/>X N <lb/>j1 <lb/>2 <lb/>lm;j <lb/>j <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>&apos; lm;j <lb/>j <lb/>ÿ <lb/>&apos; lm;j1 <lb/>j 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>ll 1 <lb/>j 2 &apos; 2 <lb/>lm;j <lb/>; <lb/>H <lb/>X <lb/>lm <lb/>H lm ; <lb/>(7) <lb/>where <lb/>&apos; lm;j &apos; lm r j ; lm lm;j r j <lb/>and <lb/>&apos; lm;j ; l 0 m 0 ;j 0 i ll 0 mm 0 jj 0 .

			<body>(iii) an equal mixing (MS Eq ) of ES with GS (c 0 c 1 <lb/>1= <lb/>2 <lb/>p <lb/>), and <lb/>(iv) a high mixing (MS Hi ) of ES with GS (c 0 1=2, <lb/>c 1 <lb/>3 <lb/>p <lb/>=2). <lb/>The computations have been done with a precision 4 of <lb/>0.0% for the set of values: N 300, n 100-200 and o <lb/>30, 40, 50 o being the last nonzero columns of the vector <lb/>T . The conditions (C18) as well as (27) are satisfied for <lb/>these values of the parameters. <lb/>The expectation value of energy, E, for MS can be ex-<lb/>pressed as <lb/>E E 0 <lb/>c 2 <lb/>1 <lb/>o <lb/>X N <lb/>iNÿo1 <lb/>k 1=2 <lb/>Di ; <lb/>(36) <lb/>where E 0 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>P N <lb/>i1 k 1=2 <lb/>Di is the (zero-point) GS energy. Now <lb/>the excess of energy over the zero-point energy is given by <lb/>the second term in the above Eq. (36). As the value of c 1 is <lb/>between 0 and 1 and since the k Di &apos;s are in ascending order <lb/>(k Di &gt; k Dj for i &gt; j), the fractional change in energy E ÿ <lb/>E 0 =E is at most about 5% (corresponding to the extreme <lb/>situation c 1 1, i.e., ES), for N 300 and o 50. <lb/>Moreover, since there are o number of terms in the sum <lb/>in the second term of Eq. (36), the excitation energy (E ÿ <lb/>E 0 ) is of the order unity (in units of 1=a, where a is the <lb/>lattice spacing). Therefore if a is chosen to be of the order <lb/>of the Planck length, then the above energy is of the order <lb/>of the Planck energy. The mass of a semiclassical BH, on <lb/>the other hand, is much larger than the Planck mass. Hence, <lb/>one may safely neglect the backreaction of the scalar field <lb/>on the background geometry. <lb/>In Fig. 1, we have plotted the logarithm of the entropy S <lb/>versus lnR=a lnn 1=2, for different values of the <lb/>excitation (o 30, 40, 50), for GS, ES, and MS (Eq/Hi). <lb/>For GS, the plot is very nearly the same as the numerical <lb/>straight line fit obtained in Ref. [7], S 0:3R=a 2 with <lb/>N 60 lattice points. For the MS (Eq/Hi) cases, as well as <lb/>for ES, the plots are nearly linear for different values of the <lb/>excitations o 30, 40, 50 and appear to coincide with the <lb/>plot for GS for large areas (A 4R 2 a 2 ). Numerical <lb/>straight line fittings of the logarithm of the ES entropy, S ES , <lb/>with lnR=a shown in [14] revealed that for smaller areas <lb/>S ES A , where is always &lt;1 and decreases as the <lb/>number of excitation o increases. To have a closer look at <lb/>the behavior of MS entropy, S MS , (for both equal and high <lb/>mixings) and the ES entropy S ES with respect to the GS <lb/>entropy, S GS , we have plotted in Fig. 2 the ratios S MS =S GS , <lb/>S ES =S GS and the inverse ratios S GS =S MS , S GS =S ES , versus <lb/>the area A. For the range of excitations (o 30, 50), all <lb/>the ratios tend to unity as the area increases. Thus the <lb/>general criterion of &apos;&apos;asymptotic equivalence&apos;&apos; [17] is ful-<lb/>filled, i.e., <lb/>lim <lb/>A!1 <lb/>S XS A <lb/>S GS A <lb/>1; <lb/>lim <lb/>A!1 <lb/>S GS A <lb/>S XS A <lb/>1 <lb/>(37) <lb/>where XS MS (Eq or Hi) or ES. In other words, the MS <lb/>(Eq/Hi) and the ES entropies coincide asymptotically with <lb/>the GS entropy. However, as is evident from Fig. 2, the <lb/>MS(Eq) entropy is closer to the GS entropy for large A, <lb/>than the MS(Hi) entropy and the ES entropy, the latter <lb/>being the farthest. This implies that the asymptotic behav-<lb/>ior is strongly influenced by the relative weight c 1 of the <lb/>mixing of ES with GS-the smaller the value of c 1 the <lb/>sharper is the asymptote. <lb/>In order to make things more transparent we have plot-<lb/>ted in Fig. 3 the best fit ratios of the MS entropies (for equal <lb/>and high mixings, with o 30, 40, 50) to the GS entropy <lb/>using a simple formula: <lb/>S MS <lb/>S GS <lb/>0 <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 <lb/>ÿ <lb/>: <lb/>(38) <lb/>The fitting parameters 0 , , and are shown in Table I. <lb/>4 . 8 <lb/>5 <lb/>5 . 2 <lb/>8 <lb/>8.2 <lb/>8.4 <lb/>8.6 <lb/>8.8 <lb/>9 <lb/>9.2 <lb/>9.4 <lb/>ln (R/a) <lb/>ln S <lb/>o = 30 <lb/>GS <lb/>ES <lb/>MS <lb/>Eq <lb/>MS Hi <lb/>4.8 <lb/>5 <lb/>5.2 <lb/>8 <lb/>8.2 <lb/>8.4 <lb/>8.6 <lb/>8.8 <lb/>9 <lb/>9.2 <lb/>9.4 <lb/>ln (R/a) <lb/>ln S <lb/>ln S vs ln (R/a) plots for GS, ES &amp; MS(Eq/Hi) <lb/>o = 40 <lb/>4.8 <lb/>5 <lb/>5.2 <lb/>8 <lb/>8.2 <lb/>8.4 <lb/>8.6 <lb/>8.8 <lb/>9 <lb/>9.2 <lb/>9.4 <lb/>ln (R/a) <lb/>ln S <lb/>o = 50 <lb/>FIG. 1 (color online).

			<body>The parameter 0 is very close to unity for all values of <lb/>o 30, 40, 50, for both MS(Eq) and MS(Hi) cases. <lb/>However, there is a slight increase in 0 as o increases <lb/>or for greater relative weight c 1 of mixing of ES with GS <lb/>for a particular o [i.e., 0 is greater in the MS(Hi) case than <lb/>in the MS(Eq) case for fixed o]. Neglecting this variation in <lb/>0 and noting that the GS entropy can be written as S GS <lb/>n 0 A=a 2 , where n 0 is a constant, we can approximately <lb/>express <lb/>S MS S GS <lb/>A <lb/>a 2 <lb/>1ÿ <lb/>; <lb/>(39) <lb/>where n 0 . As the value of the exponent (1 ÿ ) lies <lb/>between 0 and ÿ1 for both equal and high mixings (see <lb/>Table I) the second term in the above Eq. (39) may be <lb/>regarded as a power-law correction to the AL, resulting <lb/>from entanglement, when the wave function of the field is <lb/>chosen to be a superposition of GS and ES. It is important <lb/>to note that the correction term falls off rapidly with A <lb/>(due to the negative exponent) and in the semiclassical <lb/>limit (A 1) the AL is hence recovered. This lends <lb/>further credence to entanglement as a possible source of <lb/>black-hole entropy.

For the GS, there is a peak at <lb/>l 0 (s-wave), followed by another one at l 40 due to <lb/>the degeneracy factor (2l 1). The first peak shifts to a <lb/>value l &gt; 0 for the ES, and the shift is greater as o is <lb/>increased. There is, however, no second peak in this case, <lb/>although there seems to be an increase towards higher <lb/>values of l. Thus, higher partial waves are seen to get <lb/>excited with greater excitations. In each of the MS cases, <lb/>there is a trace of the first peak at l 0 as for GS, however <lb/>the amplitude of that peak is very small compared to the <lb/>second peak which appears between l 10-30 depending <lb/>on the value of the excitations o. As in the case of ES, the <lb/>second peaks for MS (Eq/Hi) are higher and far away from <lb/>l 0 for increasing values of o. However, relative to the <lb/>ES case, there is a broadening of the half-width of the <lb/>peaks for MS, though not as broad as that of the second <lb/>peak for GS. Thus, as expected, the 2l 1S l vs l curves <lb/>for MS show features that are intermediate between those <lb/>for GS and ES. <lb/>IV. LOCATION OF THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM <lb/>Let us now examine closely the expression for the <lb/>interaction matrix K ij , Eq. (9), for the system of N HOs. <lb/>The last two terms, which signify the nearest-neighbor <lb/>(NN) interaction between the oscillators, are solely respon-<lb/>sible for the entanglement entropy of black holes, i.e., <lb/>S BH 0 if these two terms are set to zero. Let us, however, <lb/>consider the situation where the NN interactions, and <lb/>hence the off-diagonal elements of K ij , are set to zero <lb/>(by hand) everywhere except in a &apos;&apos;window,&apos;&apos; such that <lb/>the indices i, j run from q ÿ s to q s, where s q. Thus <lb/>the interaction region is restricted to a width of d 2s 1 <lb/>radial lattice points. Now, choosing the position of the <lb/>center of the window q to vary between 0 and a value <lb/>q max &gt; n, we allow the window to move rigidly across <lb/>from the origin to a point outside the horizon. Figure 5 <lb/>shows the variation of the percentage contribution of the <lb/>entropy for a fixed window size of 5 lattice points (d 5, <lb/>s 2), i.e., <lb/>pcq <lb/>Sq; d 5 <lb/>S tot <lb/>100 <lb/>(40) <lb/>as a function of q for fixed values N 300, n 100 in <lb/>each of the cases GS, ES, and MS (Eq/Hi) with o 30, 50. <lb/>Here S tot is the total entropy with all the NN interactions <lb/>present, i.e., i, j running from 0 to N. <lb/>In all the cases of GS, ES, and MS (Eq/Hi) the first <lb/>observation is that pcq 0 when q is far away from n. <lb/>There is no contribution to the total entanglement entropy <lb/>if the interaction window does not include the horizon.

			<body>q n. For ES and MS, however, the peaks tend to shift <lb/>towards a value q &gt; n, their exact positions depending on <lb/>the amount of excitation o. Moreover, the amplitudes of the <lb/>peaks gradually diminish as the value of o and/or the <lb/>mixing weight c 1 increases. Thus, we infer that: <lb/>(i) The contribution to the total entropy is more from the <lb/>DOF that are in the vicinity (inside or outside) of the <lb/>horizon, rather than far from it. <lb/>(ii) The contributions, however small, from the DOF far <lb/>away from the horizon are more for MS(Eq/Hi) and <lb/>ES, compared to the GS. In other words, the con-<lb/>tributions from the far-away DOF increases with <lb/>increase in the number of excitations and amount <lb/>of mixing of ES with GS. <lb/>Further investigations have been carried out recently in <lb/>Ref. [16] to check the effects of the far-away DOF on the <lb/>total entropy, by keeping fixed the center of the window at <lb/>the horizon, i.e., q n, while increasing the window width <lb/>d from 0 to n. It is found that for GS about 85% of the total <lb/>entropy is obtained within a width of just one lattice <lb/>spacing, and within a width of d 3 almost the entire <lb/>GS entropy is recovered. Thus most of the GS entropy <lb/>comes from the DOF very close to the horizon and a small <lb/>part (about 15%) has its origin deeper inside. For ES, <lb/>however, the corresponding figures are about 60% (d <lb/>5), and the total ES entropy is recovered when d is as much <lb/>as 15-20, depending on the number of excitations o <lb/>30-50. Thus the far-away DOF contribute more to the <lb/>entropy for the ES. This, in turn, may be looked upon as <lb/>follows: the larger the deviation from the area law, the <lb/>larger is the contribution to the total entropy from the DOF <lb/>that are far away from the horizon. The situation is inter-<lb/>mediate for the MS (which itself interpolates between the <lb/>GS and ES): This is evident from Fig. 5 (and also from <lb/>Fig. 1) where unlike the curves for ES, those for the MS <lb/>cases do not show much deviations from the curve for GS, <lb/>even for high excitations o. <lb/>V. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY OF MASSIVE <lb/>SCALAR FIELD <lb/>As shown in Appendix A, the equation of motion for <lb/>metric perturbations in a general space-time with a cosmo-<lb/>logical constant jj coincides with that of a test massive <lb/>scalar field propagating in the background metric.

II will lead to the N coupled HO Hamiltonian, with <lb/>the interaction matrix K m <lb/>ij given by <lb/>K m <lb/>ij K ij ma 2 <lb/>(42) <lb/>where K ij is the interaction matrix, given by Eq. (9), for a <lb/>massless scalar field. Following the steps discussed in <lb/>Secs. II and III, we can compute the entanglement entropy <lb/>for the massive field (S m ). In Fig. 6, we have plotted S m =S 0 <lb/>(where S 0 is the entropy for the massless scalar) for the GS, <lb/>ES, and MS(Eq/Hi) for N 300, n 100, o 50. The <lb/>Gaussian fits indicate an exponential fall-off of S m with <lb/>respect to S 0 as the mass increases: <lb/>S m S 0 expÿ 1 ma 2 <lb/>(43) <lb/>where 1 , 2 , and are the fitting parameters. Depending <lb/>on the state (GS, ES, or MS), the parameter 1 varies <lb/>between 2.77 and 3.24, 2 is between 0.077 and 0.001, <lb/>and the power is close to 2. Thus approximately S m =S 0 <lb/>scales as e ÿm 2 a 2 . There is, however, a small variation in the <lb/>power for the different cases. The exponential damping <lb/>is strongest for GS, and gradually slows down as more and <lb/>more ES oscillators are mixed with GS, the damping is <lb/>slowest for the ES case. <lb/>Although S m scales as S 0 times a mass-dependent ex-<lb/>ponential term, the fitting parameters 1 , 2 , and change <lb/>very little for the different cases GS, MS(Eq/Hi), and ES, <lb/>even for a fairly high amount of excitation o 50. As <lb/>such, for a fixed mass m, the variations lnS vs lnR=a for <lb/>all the cases remain almost the same as those for massless <lb/>scalar field, cf. Fig. 1. The analysis and inferences of the <lb/>previous sections for the massless scalar go through for the <lb/>massive scalar field, resulting in correction terms obtained <lb/>before. <lb/>VI. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In this work, we have obtained power-law corrections to <lb/>entanglement entropy, which may be relevant for the en-<lb/>tropy of BH. Indeed, as shown in Appendices A and B, <lb/>certain modes of gravitational perturbations in black-hole <lb/>space-times behave as minimally coupled scalar fields. <lb/>Also for computation of time-independent quantities <lb/>done at a fixed value of Lemaître time, it suffices to <lb/>consider an effective flat space Hamiltonian. Extending <lb/>the analysis of the earlier work [14], we have shown that <lb/>for small black-hole areas the area law is violated not only <lb/>when the oscillator modes that represent the scalar DOF <lb/>are in ES, but also when they are in a linear superposition <lb/>of GS and ES. We found that the corrections to the AL <lb/>become increasingly significant as the proportion of ES in <lb/>the superposed state increases. Conversely, for large hori-<lb/>zon areas, these corrections are relatively small and the AL <lb/>is recovered. <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>m * a <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>for GS (n = 100) <lb/>S m = S 0 exp[−2.77*(m*a + 0.077) <lb/>2.246 <lb/>] <lb/>Data <lb/>Best Fit <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>m * a <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>S m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>for ES (n = 100, o = 50) <lb/>S m = S 0 exp[−3.24*(m*a + 0.001) <lb/>2.078 <lb/>] <lb/>Data <lb/>Best Fit <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>m * a <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>S m /S 0 for MS Eq (n = 100, o = 50) <lb/>S m <lb/>= S <lb/>0 <lb/>exp[−2.85*(m*a + 0.061) 2.201 ] <lb/>Data <lb/>Best Fit <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>m * a <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>/S <lb/>0 <lb/>S m /S 0 for MS Hi (n = 100, o = 50) <lb/>S <lb/>m <lb/>= S <lb/>0 <lb/>exp[−2.99*(m*a + 0.044) 2.158 ] <lb/>Data <lb/>Best Fit <lb/>FIG. 6 (color online).

			<body>It is interesting to compare and contrast the power-law <lb/>corrections obtained here to those derived in the case of <lb/>higher-derivative gravity [15]. The power-law corrections <lb/>to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy derived in both-en-<lb/>tanglement and higher-derivative gravity-these ap-<lb/>proaches have the same features. For instance, it was <lb/>shown that the entropy of a 5-dimensional Boulware-<lb/>Deser black hole [18] is given by <lb/>S <lb/>A <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>c <lb/>A 2=3 <lb/>; <lb/>c constant: <lb/>(44) <lb/>As in Eq. (39) the above entropy is proportional to area for <lb/>large horizon radius, however it strongly deviates in the <lb/>small horizon limit. It is important to note that the correc-<lb/>tions to the black-hole entropy are generic and valid even <lb/>for black holes in general relativity without any higher <lb/>curvature terms. 5 It is interesting to investigate the relation <lb/>between the entanglement entropy with that of the Noether <lb/>charge approach [19]. <lb/>The location of the DOF that give rise to the entangle-<lb/>ment entropy has important implications as far as the <lb/>corrections to the AL is concerned. It is found that for <lb/>GS, ES, and MS, the contributions to the total entropy from <lb/>the DOF that are nearest to the horizon are maximum. <lb/>However, there are small contributions from DOF that <lb/>are far away from the horizon, which also need to be taken <lb/>into account in order for the AL to emerge. These contri-<lb/>butions are least in the case of GS and gradually increase as <lb/>the proportion of mixing of ES with GS and/or the amount <lb/>of excitation increases. Correspondingly, there are increas-<lb/>ing deviations from the AL. Thus one is led to conclude <lb/>that the AL is intimately linked with near horizon DOF. <lb/>We have also shown that the mass of the scalar field does <lb/>not have much influence on the corrections to the AL. The <lb/>total entropy for the massive field scales as that of the <lb/>massless field times a mass-dependent exponentially <lb/>damping term that varies very slowly with the mixing <lb/>proportion and the amount of excitation which are key to <lb/>producing the AL corrections. <lb/>Open problems in the context of entanglement entropy <lb/>include: (i) The proportionality constant in the relation S <lb/>0:3R=a 2 for GS obtained in Ref. [7] differs from the 1=4 <lb/>in the Bekenstein-Hawking relation [Eq. (2)]. This discrep-<lb/>ancy persists for MS and ES. A probable reason behind this <lb/>mismatch is the dependence of the prefactor on the type of <lb/>the discretization scheme. For example, another discreti-<lb/>zation scheme, resulting in the NN interactions between <lb/>four or more immediate neighbors, would result in a differ-<lb/>ent prefactor. Is it then at all possible to obtain the <lb/>Bekenstein-Hawking value? (ii) Can a temperature emerge <lb/>in the entanglement entropy scenario, and if so, then along <lb/>with the current entropy, will it be consistent with the first <lb/>law of BH thermodynamics? (iii) Are the second and third <lb/>laws of thermodynamics valid for this entropy? (iv) Can <lb/>the entanglement of scalar fields help us to understand the <lb/>evolution or dynamics of BHs and the information loss <lb/>problem? We hope to report on these in the future. <lb/>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <lb/>The works of S. D. and S. Sur are supported by the <lb/>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of <lb/>Canada. <lb/>Note added.-Recently, in Ref. [20], the authors have <lb/>calculated the subleading power-law corrections to the <lb/>Bekenstein-Hawking entropy using the canonical en-<lb/>semble (aka brick wall) approach [8]. The results reported <lb/>there agree with the numerical results derived in this work. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">APPENDIX A: WHY CONSIDER SCALAR FIELDS? <lb/>In this appendix, we briefly discuss the motivation for <lb/>obtaining the entanglement entropy of a scalar field.

We can remove the gauge arbitrariness by im-<lb/>posing the harmonic gauge condition @ h <lb/>0 [21]. <lb/>Assuming h to be small, we can keep only the first <lb/>derivatives of h . With these two conditions, the action <lb/>(A2) reduces to (for more details see Ref. [22], pp. 330-<lb/>332) <lb/></div>

However, 0 is a Gaussian that <lb/>attenuates virtually to zero beyond its few sigma limits. <lb/>Therefore, if <lb/>1 t T <lb/>max t max 1; <lb/>2 t T <lb/>max t max 1 <lb/>(C18) <lb/>where <lb/>t T <lb/>max <lb/>3N ÿ n <lb/>2Tr ÿ <lb/>p <lb/>1; 1; . . . <lb/>(C19) <lb/>corresponding to 3 limits of the Gaussian inside 0 , then <lb/>one may approximate <lb/>1 ÿ <lb/>t T t t 0T t 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>t T t 0 <lb/>exp <lb/>ÿ <lb/>t T t t 0T t 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>t T t 0 <lb/>: <lb/>(C20) <lb/>As such, with the following shift of parameters, <lb/>0 ; <lb/>0 ; <lb/>(C21) <lb/>the approximated ES density matrix is also a Gaussian, <lb/>1 t; t 0 exp <lb/>ÿ <lb/>t T 0 t t 0T 0 t 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>t T 0 t 0 <lb/>: (C22) <lb/>This can be factorized once again into two HO density <lb/>matrices, and the associated entanglement entropy can be <lb/>computed. For the following set of values: N 300, n <lb/>100-200, o 10-50, o being the number of last nonvan-<lb/>ishing entries in the vector T , i.e., T 1= <lb/>o <lb/>p <lb/>0; ; 0; 1; ; 1, the entropy computation is done nu-<lb/>merically (using MATLAB) in [14]. The precision setting <lb/>in the computation had been 0.1% and the criteria (C18) is <lb/>satisfied for the above choice of the parameters N, n, and o. <lb/>The results show that the ES entropy scales as a power of <lb/>the area. The power, however, is always less than unity (for <lb/>any o &gt; 0) and is lesser and lesser, the higher the value of <lb/>o. The AL is thus always violated for the chosen range of <lb/>values of n 100-200. The other interesting observation <lb/>made in [14] is the shifting of peaks in the variation of the <lb/>partial waves 2l 1S l with l for ES as compared to the <lb/>case for GS. <lb/></div>
