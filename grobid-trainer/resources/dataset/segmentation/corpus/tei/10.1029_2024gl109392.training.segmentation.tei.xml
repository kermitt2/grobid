        <body>1. Introduction <lb/>Sea-ice is a crucial component in the Earth&apos;s system. The rapid decrease of Arctic sea ice cover within the past <lb/>few decades is a convincing signal of climate change and Arctic Amplification which is mainly indicated by <lb/>the rising surface air temperature (SAT) (Cohen et al., 2014; Graversen et al., 2008; Johannessen et al., 2004; <lb/>Polyakov et al., 2002; Serreze &amp; Francis, 2006). Satellite observations showed that there has been a downward <lb/>trend in the annual Arctic minimum sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) since 1979 (Comiso et al., 2017; <lb/>Serreze &amp; Meier, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). The SIE is defined as the total region with at least 15% ice cover. <lb/>The SIA is defined as the total area covered by sea ice. Meanwhile, the pronounced interannual retreat of <lb/>multiyear-ice (MYI) and the increasing extent of first-year ice (FYI) make a &quot;seasonal ice free&quot; Arctic possible <lb/>in the future (Jahn et al., 2016; Stroeve &amp; Notz, 2015), which would result in a profound influence on the global <lb/>climate (Curry et al., 1995; Graversen &amp; Wang, 2009; Katlein et al., 2019) and regional ecosystems (Moline <lb/>et al., 2008; Sweetman et al., 2017; Tynan &amp; DeMaster, 1997). Therefore, it is essential to monitor sea ice change, <lb/>especially during melting season, before this great transformation. <lb/>Satellite remote sensing detects electromagnetic radiation from features on the Earth&apos;s surface and in the atmos-<lb/>phere without requiring direct contact. Since sea-ice has a higher albedo than the surrounding ocean, it reflects <lb/>more solar radiation and is therefore represented as a brighter object in spaceborne visible imagery such as <lb/>from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Guenther et al., 2002) and Visible Infrared <lb/>Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS; Xiong et al., 2014). However, clouds and darkness frequently prevent the <lb/>observation of sea ice from visible sensors. Passive microwave (PM) radiometry can detect sea-ice since the <lb/>surface emissivity, the ratio of emitted energy from a surface to that of a perfect emitter, is different than that of <lb/>liquid water. The surface emissivity of water, ice and snow are close to unity in the thermal infrared (wavelengths, <lb/>λ, of 8-14 μm) (Sobrino &amp; Cuenca, 1999) but are much more variable at microwave frequencies, depending on <lb/>wavelength and polarization. <lb/></body>

        <front>Abstract Passive microwave (PM) observations have been used to monitor ice retreat in the Arctic. <lb/>However, various PM sea ice concentration (SIC) algorithms are prone to underestimate ice fraction during <lb/>summer. We evaluated the accuracy of 2002-2019 low SICs in the Central Arctic Ocean of four PM products <lb/>from the University of Bremen, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the Ocean and Sea Ice <lb/>Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF), and two reanalysis data sets from the fifth generation of European <lb/>ReAnalysis (ERA5) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 <lb/>(MERRA-2). Three reference fields were used: (a) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <lb/>and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) true-color composites, (b) MODIS sea ice extent, and <lb/>(c) multi-product ensemble (MPE-SIC) comprising the median of collocated SIC estimates. Our results indicate <lb/>SICs derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer -Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and <lb/>the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) high frequency channels have the best accuracy. <lb/>Reanalysis SICs indicate almost identical patterns as their remote sensing inputs. The assessment shows that the <lb/>Bremen (+1.06%) and NSIDC (+0.99%) SICs are higher than the median field, while the OSI-401 (-6.65%) <lb/>and OSI-408 (-4.64%) have negative mean deviations. The mean error of MODIS-derived SIC (-0.80%) is <lb/>smaller than PM SICs. These small mean values belie wide distributions of values. The correlation coefficients <lb/>of pairs of time series of Low sea-Ice Concentration Index range from 0.37 to 0.96. <lb/>SONG AND MINNETT <lb/>© 2024 The Authors.

        <body>The sea-ice concentration (SIC) is defined as the proportion of an ocean area that is ice-covered and has been <lb/>derived from PM measurements, expressed as brightness temperature (Tb), since the 1970s. The Electrically <lb/>Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) on Nimbus-5 provided the first global sea-ice cover data (Parkinson <lb/>et al., 1987). ESMR measured radiation at 19.35 GHz and this leads to a limited accuracy of the retrieved sea-ice <lb/>cover because the ambiguity caused as well by the variations of surface emissivity and temperature as by atmos-<lb/>pheric water vapor and cloud liquid water cannot be interpreted correctly from measurements taken at a single <lb/>frequency. The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on Nimbus-7 was in operation from <lb/>November 1978 to August 1987 and collected sea-ice data with improved accuracy compared to its predecessors <lb/>due to its dual-polarized microwave channels (Cavalieri et al., 1984). Beginning in 1987, SMMR was replaced by <lb/>a series of similar sensors called the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Micro-<lb/>wave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS). The SSMISs are conical scanning sensors, as were SMMRs and SSM/Is, and the <lb/>Instantaneous Fields of Views (IFOVs) of the SSMIS range from 13.1 × 14.4 km at 91.655 GHz to 45 × 68 km at <lb/>19.35 GHz, determined by the antenna dimensions of 61 × 66 cm. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiom-<lb/>eter -Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was launched on Aqua in May 2002. It measured horizontally (H) and <lb/>vertically (V) polarized radiation in six channels: 6.9 GHz, 10.7 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, 89 GHz. <lb/>Its successor, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) on the Japan Aerospace Exploration <lb/>Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W), has the same frequencies with the <lb/>addition of a 7.3 GHz channel that is used for radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation for sea-surface <lb/>temperature retrievals. AMSR-E had a 1.6 m antenna, increased to 2.0 m for AMSR2, so the spatial resolutions <lb/>are improved approximately threefold over those of SMMR and SSM/I. <lb/>The annual variations of SIE and SIA are similar, but SIA is always the smaller and is more sensitive to the <lb/>summertime SIC (Ivanova et al., 2014). However, the seasonal and decadal trends of SIA and SIE produced by <lb/>different algorithms have discrepancies since each algorithm has different sensitivities to surface emissivity and <lb/>atmospheric effects (Andersen et al., 2007; Comiso et al., 2017). When assimilating SIC product into climate <lb/>models, an inaccuracy of 10% in SIC is usually assumed (Kimmritz et al., 2018; Tietsche et al., 2012). Never-<lb/>theless, various surface properties (e.g., ice type, melt ponds, leads), can contribute ∼30% inaccuracy in satellite <lb/>derived summer SICs. A study by Han and Kim (2018) evaluated the performance of four PM SIC algorithms <lb/>of the summertime Chukchi Sea by comparison with 78 KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) <lb/>enhanced wide-swath X-band high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Their results showed <lb/>mean biases in the NASA Team algorithm (NT; Cavalieri et al., 1984) of -25.65%, the Bootstrap algorithm <lb/>(Comiso, 1986) of +1.53%, OSI SAF (Breivik et al., 2001) of -7.59% and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence <lb/>Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI; Spreen et al., 2008) of -8.53% over the consolidated pack ice zone <lb/>with 100% ice concentration. In a case study by Rösel and Kaleschke (2012b), three SIC images from AMSR-E, <lb/>derived with the ASI, the enhanced NASA Team algorithm (NT2; Markus &amp; Cavalieri, 2000), and Bootstrap <lb/>algorithms for the area of the Canadian Archipelago, were compared with MODIS-derived SIC and melt pond <lb/>fraction (MPF). The MPF is defined as the ratio of melt pond areas to SIA. In the same region with mean 93% ice <lb/>cover and around 40% MPF determined from MODIS data, the ASI algorithm had a 45% mean ice concentration, <lb/>the NT2 result was 65%; and the Bootstrap algorithm showed 55%. Although in this case the NT2 algorithm was <lb/>closest to the MODIS result, it was still far from the 93% ice concentration determined from the MODIS data. <lb/>The misinterpretation of sea ice with melt ponds has been found among 13 SIC algorithms (Ivanova et al., 2015). <lb/>The long-term PM SICs play important roles in representing Arctic climate change and in evaluating climate <lb/>models. Hence, a concern emerges regarding our confidence in the extent and distributions of low ice concentra-<lb/>tion or ice-free sea surface indicated by satellite observations. Although previous studies have concluded that in <lb/>addition to there being a general underestimation of SIC during summer conditions, the size of the discrepancy <lb/>is likely to be dependent in the SIC itself, with increasing errors as SIC declines. Even though some ice retrieval <lb/>methods use dynamic tie points (values for pure surface types), the tie-point defined for 100% ice during summer <lb/>are likely to contain melt ponds, so that the resulting ice concentration uncertainty is correlative to the onset of <lb/>melt ponds. Furthermore, research focused on small areas, usually along the ice pack edge that is affected by open <lb/>ocean processes (Wadhams, 1986), known as the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and/or short sampling times, does not <lb/>necessarily support indications of sea ice change in the Central Arctic, an area which used to be covered by high <lb/>concentration ice with different ice types, but where reliable observations are rare compared with the MIZ. The <lb/>uncertainty in SIC retrievals from various sensors and algorithms mainly results from the inaccurate interpreta-<lb/>tion of measurements of radiative energy which is influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of the atmosphere and <lb/></body>

        <body>of the surface (Andersen et al., 2006, 2007). And the different algorithm sensitivities to atmospheric and surface <lb/>conditions are likely to cause different errors in the low and high SIC regions (Han &amp; Kim, 2018). Therefore, by <lb/>analyzing the agreement of PM SIC products we have the chance to explore relative sensitivities of measurements <lb/>in various microwave channels to the presence of melt ponds, which can give us further knowledge to optimize <lb/>SIC retrieval methods. <lb/>The lack of assessment of reanalysis SIC products has the potential to be problematic since ice cover from opera-<lb/>tional reanalysis data sets, for example, the fifth generation European ReAnalysis (ERA5; Hersbach et al., 2020) <lb/>and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2; Gelaro <lb/>et al., 2017), offers temporally and spatially complete representation of sea ice, but biases and uncertainties of <lb/>reanalysis SIC data sets are not well understood. Even though Graham et al. (2019) evaluated the performance <lb/>of six reanalysis data sets over Arctic sea ice, only atmospheric variables, such as the 2-m temperature, 10-m <lb/>wind speed, and total column water vapor, were validated using observations from the Norwegian Young Sea Ice <lb/>campaign. In this study, we investigated the performance of two reanalysis SIC and four PM SIC products using <lb/>the same criteria; this provides valuable knowledge about the accuracy of daily reanalysis SICs. <lb/>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the research area and evaluated SIC data sets. <lb/>Section 3 introduces the MODIS SIC retrieval algorithm, Low sea-Ice Concentration Index (LICI), and the eval-<lb/>uation methods of this study. The correlation results of LICI and the accuracy evaluation of SIC products via <lb/>different methods are presented in Section 4. Section 5 is a discussion and Section 6 summarizes the work and <lb/>resulting conclusions as well as giving some suggestions for future research. <lb/>2. Research Area and Data <lb/>2.1. Research Area <lb/>There are several definitions of the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) based on hydrography, international accord, <lb/>and absolute coordinates. We focus on the SIC retrieval within the zone between 84°N and 88.3°N-hereinafter <lb/>referred to as CAO. The southern limit is set to 84°N to eliminate areas with land ice. The northern limit removes <lb/>the influence of missing data near the North pole due to the combination of satellite orbital geometry and swath <lb/>widths of the microwave radiometers. The summertime is defined here to be from June 1 to October 31. <lb/>2.2. Passive Microwave (PM) SIC Products <lb/>2.2.1. ARTIST Sea Ice (ASI) SIC Product From AMSR-E/AMSR2 <lb/>Researchers at the University of Bremen applied the ASI algorithm to swath AMSR-E L1A and AMSR2 L1B <lb/>data and mapped swath-width SIC for each calendar day (UTC) into a 6.25 km polar stereographic grid, a resolu-<lb/>tion based on considering the size of IFOV of AMSR-E 89 GHz (Spreen et al., 2008). The ASI algorithm uses the <lb/>Tb differences at 89V and 89H to retrieve SIC because different ice surfaces show similar emissivity differences <lb/>while water has a much larger value. Since high frequency channels are used, the ASI algorithm is sensitive to <lb/>weather conditions. In this study, we used ASI SIC products from 2002 to 2019 and this data set is hereafter <lb/>referred as Bremen. <lb/>2.2.2. NASA-Team2 (NT2) SIC Product From AMSR-E and AMSR2 <lb/>The NSIDC provides daily SIC products with a grid scale of 12.5 km based on measurements of AMSR-E (Data <lb/>Set ID: AE_SI12) (Cavalieri et al., 2014) and AMSR2 (Data Set ID: AU_SI12) (Meier et al., 2018). These prod-<lb/>ucts use the NT2 algorithm which assumes three surface types (first-year ice, multi-year ice, and open water) and <lb/>estimates SIC by applying a set of coefficients to the observed polarization ratio (PR) of 19 GHz and the spectral <lb/>gradient ratio (GR) between 19 and 37V. The difference between GR (85V/19V) and GR (85H/19H) are used to <lb/>resolve the errors due to surface snow effects of the NT algorithm. The time periods are from 1 June 2002 to 4 <lb/>October 2011 and 2 July 2012 to 2019, respectively. These products are hereafter referred as NSIDC. <lb/>2.2.3. OSI-SAF SSMIS SIC Product <lb/>The OSI-401-b data set (identified as OSI-401-d from 25 April 2023), hereafter OSI-401, is one of the European <lb/>Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Appli-<lb/>cation Facility (OSI-SAF) global SIC products (Tonboe &amp; Lavelle, 2016). It is derived from SSMIS observations <lb/></body>

        <body>using the OSI SAF algorithm. Prior to calculating SIC, Tb measurements were corrected for wind roughening <lb/>over open water and water vapor in the atmosphere using several variables from the ECMWF weather forecast <lb/>fields: surface wind speed, 2 m air temperature, total column water vapor, and total column cloud liquid water. <lb/>The OSI SAF algorithm is a hybrid of the Bootstrap frequency (BF) mode (Comiso, 1995) and the Bristol <lb/>algorithm (Smith, 1996). The BF algorithm assumes two surface types (sea ice and open water) and uses Tbs <lb/>of 19 and 37V to estimate SIC. The Bristol algorithm uses both PR and GR information from 19V, 37V and <lb/>37H. If the BF algorithm indicates open water (SIC BF = 0), then SIC OSISAF = SIC BF . For ice concentration up to <lb/>40%, SIC OSISAF is the average from the BF and Bristol algorithms. When the BF algorithm indicates SIC &gt; 40%, <lb/>the SIC OSISAF = SIC Bristol . This algorithm has been in operation since 1 March 2005. The spatial resolution of <lb/>this SIC product is 10 km. However, it is an over-sampled grid since the footprints of 19 and 37 GHz channels of <lb/>SSMIS are 73 × 47 km and 41 × 31 km. This data set has been the remote sensing input to the ERA5 SIC since <lb/>September 2007, and MERRA-2 SIC since April 2006. Both ERA5 and MERRA-2 data sets will be discussed <lb/>below. <lb/>2.2.4. OSI-SAF AMSR2 SIC Product <lb/>The OSI-408 data set (identified as OSI-408-a from 25 April 2023), here after OSI-408, is another operational <lb/>SIC product from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF (Tian et al., 2015) which uses AMSR2 observations as an input. <lb/>The Tb correction approach is as the same as the one described in Section 2.2.3. The SIC retrieval algorithm was <lb/>developed at the Technical University of Denmark (TUD) and utilizes the 19 GHz, 37 GHz, and 89 GHz chan-<lb/>nels. First, the SIC is estimated from the BF algorithm at a low spatial resolution and then by a linear function of <lb/>Tbs at 89V and 89H. The final SIC is the geometric mean of the two values. Therefore, the TUD hybrid algorithm <lb/>reduces the atmospheric sensitivity inherent in measurements near 90 GHz while providing increased resolution <lb/>for concentrations above 10%-20% (Andersen et al., 2006). The SIC estimates are gridded on the same 10 km <lb/>grid as the OSI-401 and are also over-sampled. The time coverage of this product is from 19 September 2016. <lb/>2.3. Reanalysis SIC Products <lb/>2.3.1. ECMWF ERA5 SIC Product <lb/>ERA5 is the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis released by ECMWF (Hersbach et al., 2020). The ERA5 SIC <lb/>has 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution and the values are updated once per day. The ERA5 is based on ECMWF <lb/>Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 and ingested the Operational Sea-surface Temperature and Sea Ice <lb/>Analysis (OSTIA; Good et al., 2020) data set, which uses OSI-401 for SIC, from 2007 to present. <lb/>2.3.2. NASA Goddard MERRA-2 SIC Product <lb/>MERRA-2 is produced using the Goddard Earth Observing System atmospheric data assimilation system, <lb/>version 5.12.4 (GEOS-5.12.4) (Gelaro et al., 2017). Unlike MERRA (Rienecker et al., 2011) which used 1° <lb/>weekly (monthly before 29 October 1981) sea surface temperature (SST) and SIC from Reynolds et al. (2002) <lb/>as input, MERRA-2 has used the daily, 0.25° Reynolds et al.

        <body>3. Methodology <lb/>3.1. MODIS SIC Retrieval <lb/>To calculate the MODIS SIC, we adapted the approach used by Cavalieri et al. (2010). They retrieve SIC from <lb/>broadband top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from three MODIS bands. Cavalieri et al. (2010) first calculated <lb/>the broadband albedo (0.46-0.67 μm) from MODIS bands 1, 4, and 3 corresponding to the red, green, and blue <lb/>parts of visible spectrum using the following weights derived by Liang et al. (1999): <lb/>broadband TOA albedo = band1 * 0.3265 + band4 * 0.2366 + band3 * 0.4364 <lb/>(1) <lb/>Then, they use the same thresholds as Cavalieri et al. (2006) to classify surface cover into four different types <lb/>(open water, new ice, young ice, and first-year ice). For our study, we simplified the thresholds to provide a <lb/>binary classification map. If albedo &lt;0.06, the pixel is evaluated as pure water, and if albedo &gt;0.60, it is pure ice <lb/>(Perovich, 1996). The final step is to project MODIS SIC onto the target resolution grid. <lb/>3.2. Low Sea-Ice Concentration Index <lb/>The Low sea-Ice Concentration Index (LICI) proposed by Li et al. (2018) describes the proportion of low SIC <lb/>values within an area. Following Li et al. (2018), we put 15%-75% as the low SIC range and calculated the ratio <lb/>of low SIC area and the area of the Central Arctic. The formula is defined by: <lb/>LICI = <lb/>∑ <lb/>𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖(15% &lt; 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 &lt; 75%)∕ <lb/>∑ <lb/>𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 <lb/>(2) <lb/>where A i is the area of each grid cell, C i is estimated SIC in each cell. <lb/>The LICI time series generated from daily LICI values provides an effective way to quantify the progression of <lb/>melting sea ice and greatly simplifies the comparisons of SIC products with different resolutions. Peaks in the <lb/>LICI time series, detected using a 7-day window and 5% threshold (at least 5% area of SICs in the Central Arctic <lb/>are &lt;75%), will be used to obtain a selection of low ice concentration cases for validation of the accuracy of the <lb/>satellite retrievals of SIC. <lb/>3.3. Correlation Analysis <lb/>Firstly, the linear relationships of LICI time series (four from PM SICs and two from reanalysis SICs) were inves-<lb/>tigated by analyzing Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficient (CC), r XY : <lb/>𝑟𝑟XY = <lb/>∑ 𝑛𝑛 <lb/>𝑖𝑖=1 <lb/>( <lb/>𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 -𝑋𝑋 <lb/>)( <lb/>𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 -𝑌𝑌 <lb/>) <lb/>√ <lb/>∑ 𝑛𝑛 <lb/>𝑖𝑖=1 <lb/>( <lb/>𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 -𝑋𝑋 <lb/>) 2 <lb/>√ <lb/>∑ 𝑛𝑛 <lb/>𝑖𝑖=1 <lb/>( <lb/>𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 -𝑌𝑌 <lb/>) 2 <lb/>(3) <lb/>The value of r XY lies between -1 and +1 indicating the extent two variables are linearly related. A symmetri-<lb/>cal autocorrelation matrix is obtained by calculating CC of each pair of LICI time series. To further assess the <lb/>temporal variability, that is, &quot;leader-follower&quot; relationships, of highly related signals, we use Time Lagged Cross <lb/>Correlation (TLCC) which is derived by incrementally shifting one of the time series vectors in time and repeat-<lb/>edly calculating the correlation between two signals. If the peak correlation is where the offset = 0, it indicates <lb/>the pair of time series is mostly synchronized. However, the peak correlation may be at a different offset if one <lb/>signal leads the other. <lb/>3.4. Reference Fields and Accuracy Validation Approaches <lb/>3.4.1. Human-Inspection Based on Composite True-Color Imagery <lb/>NASA Worldview (https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) provides near real-time, true-color imagery from both <lb/>MODIS and VIIRS. This imagery is termed as &quot;corrected reflectance&quot; because it is generated from L1B radi-<lb/>ances using a simple atmospheric correction algorithm to remove gross atmospheric effects, such as Rayleigh <lb/>scattering, but ignoring aerosol effects. For MODIS, Band 1 (red) at 250 m resolution is used to sharpen Bands <lb/></body>

        <body>3 (blue) and 4 (green) at 500 m resolution so the resulting geometric imagery resolution is 250 m; the temporal <lb/>resolution of composite reflectance imagery is daily and is available since 24 February 2000 for MODIS on Terra <lb/>and 3 July 2002 for MODIS on Aqua. The corrected reflectance gives a true color representation of the Earth&apos;s <lb/>surface and atmospheric features, but it is subject to loss of clarity due to uncorrected atmospheric effects. In <lb/>contrast, the MODIS land surface reflectance product (MOD09, described below) is based on a more complete <lb/>atmospheric correction algorithm including an aerosol correction (Vermote &amp; Kotchenova, 2008), made it also <lb/>available over sea ice. So, the MODIS corrected reflectance imagery and MODIS land surface reflectance prod-<lb/>uct are very similar in clear atmospheric conditions, which facilitates our assessment, but they will be different <lb/>when aerosols are present. As for VIIRS imagery visualized in Worldview, band I1 (red), band M4 (green) and <lb/>band M3 (blue) are used. The sensor resolution is 750 m for the M Bands and 375 m for the I Band, and imagery <lb/>resolution is 250 m. The VIIRS pixels have limited growth in the scan direction away from nadir through the <lb/>process of pixel aggregation (Minnett et al., 2020; Schueler et al., 2013). <lb/>The preliminary evaluation was based on the spatial distribution of sea ice shown in the corrected reflectance <lb/>imagery from MODIS and VIIRS. By visual inspection, it was straightforward to identify ice and open water in <lb/>a true-color image, however, dark nilas might be hard to discern from open water in rare cases. This supports the <lb/>idea that people can make use of the landscape scale (1-10s km) organization of sea ice from MODIS and VIIRS <lb/>corrected reflectance imagery from NASA Worldview to estimate SIC under clear-sky conditions. Table 2 lists <lb/>some common sea ice organization types and corresponding characteristics Sea Ice Glossary (n.d). By identifying <lb/>the spatial distribution of ice, we can obtain a reference range of SIC values. <lb/>In Figure 1, the left panel shows SIC derived using the ASI algorithm and the image on the right is the MODIS/ <lb/>Aqua corrected reflectance corresponding to the region inside the black box in the SIC map on the left.

        <body>MODIS true-color imagery is a daily composite with dimensions ∼400 km × ∼300 km at 500 m spatial resolu-<lb/>tion. Dark pixels are open water and white structures with sharp edges are floes and pack ice. The bright object <lb/>at the top of this image is a cluster of dense clouds which contain small patterns of waves and rolls. The edges of <lb/>clouds are vague, sometimes with shadows in the surrounding pixels. The color tones of thin clouds vary since <lb/>part of the light penetrates to reveal underlying features at the sea surface. In the upper left, ice-free water as well <lb/>as a cluster of small floes can be recognized outside the consolidated pack ice boundary, which is evidence of <lb/>the low ice concentration, approximately 10%-20% in this sub-area. The surrounding open pack ice, composed <lb/>of individual floes and many leads, has ice cover 40%-60%. The range of values is consistent with the low ice <lb/>concentration area in the PM SIC map. <lb/>Figure 2, however, is an example of disagreement between ice cover determined by PM algorithms and from <lb/>visible images. The corrected reflectance from MODIS/Aqua on the right indicates typical consolidated pack ice <lb/>in which the floes are frozen together with some cracks or rifts. Though there is a subregion showing less reflec-<lb/>tance/albedo probably due to melt ponds, the ice cover is practically 100%. With this information, we can confirm <lb/>that the lower PM-derived SIC (50%-70%) in the selected region underestimates the human-derived ice cover <lb/>by at least 30%. The underestimations might be from the melting surface which makes its characteristics close to <lb/>open water in the microwave range. <lb/>We repeated this evaluation process for LICI time series peaks which correspond to independent low SIC cases. <lb/>Images within a 7-day window (±3 days from the date when low SICs occurred) were taken into consideration <lb/>to reduce the effect of cloud contamination. We classified our results into four groups based on the difference <lb/>between visually inspected SIC and the SIC estimates to be validated: Accurate (-20% to +20%), Inaccurate <lb/>(underestimated if &lt;-20% and overestimated if &gt;+20%) and Mixed (contain two or more categories). <lb/>3.4.2. Validation Using MODIS SIE Product <lb/>MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua SIE Daily L3 Global 1 km Equal Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) Day <lb/>(MOD29P1D and MYD29P1D), Version 5, was the second validation reference (Hall et al., 2006). The EASE <lb/>Grids (Brodzik et al., 2012) are intended to minimize the amount of areal distortion over the poles so that compar-<lb/>isons and analyses of different fields are facilitated. The SIE field was provided as tiles of data gridded in the <lb/>original EASE-Grid Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area map projection, with 1 km cell size and 951 × 951 cells of <lb/>each tile. The &quot;MOD&quot; prefix represents Terra-derived data and &quot;MYD&quot; means Aqua-derived. The ice detection <lb/>algorithm of this product assumes that sea ice is snow covered and snow dominates the reflectance characteristics <lb/>(Riggs et al., 1999). It uses the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) as the main criterion. Since snow has <lb/>high reflectance at visible wavelengths and low reflectance at wavelengths of ∼1.6 μm, the MODIS NDSI is <lb/>Figure 2. Left is daily SIC map from Bremen for 07/01/2008. Right is corrected reflectance image from an overpass of <lb/>MODIS/Aqua on the same day in the relatively low SIC regions inside the black box in the left image. <lb/></body>

        <body>defined as the ratio of the difference between band 4 (Green) and band 6 <lb/>(Short Wave Infrared) and their sum. The details of this algorithm can be <lb/>found in Riggs et al. (1999). <lb/>To validate all LICI peak cases using daily MODIS SIE, we firstly mask out <lb/>clouds and assign a value of 1 to ice pixels and 0 to ocean pixels. Then, we <lb/>re-project and down-sample cloud-free MODIS SIE into the target resolution <lb/>grids (Bremen, NSIDC and OSI-408 polar stereographic grids, respectively, <lb/>6.25, 12.5 and 10 km; ERA5: 0.25°). We use ERA5 as a proxy of OSI-401 <lb/>and MERRA-2 due to high correlations among those three data sets (see <lb/>details in Section 4.2). Then, if more than 10 pixels show low ice concentra-<lb/>tions (&lt;75%), we calculate the mean of these pixels and use the outcome to <lb/>compare with the means of the target data sets (Bremen, NSIDC, OSI-408, <lb/>and ERA5) using the same array of pixels. On the contrary, if fewer cells <lb/>(&lt;10) show low ice concentrations, we use the mean of all valid pixels to <lb/>compare with the average of the target data sets with the same array of pixels. <lb/>Finally, a simpler criterion was used to evaluate the SIC accuracy based on <lb/>the mean SIC difference: if the difference is within the range of ±20%, the <lb/>evaluated case was considered to be Accurate, and if the absolute value of <lb/>the difference exceeds 20%, the evaluated case was classified as Inaccurate. <lb/>3.4.3. Validation Using Multi-Product Ensemble SIC (MPE-SIC) <lb/>Since optical data are rendered problematic by the effects of clouds, we <lb/>devised a way of using the median values of all visible and PM SICs in a <lb/>common grid to determine the relative accuracy of the individual SICs. <lb/>This method is taken from the GHRSST multi-product ensemble (Martin <lb/>et al., 2012) which used the median field of independent SST retrievals as the <lb/>reference to assess the relative accuracy of each retrieved SST. <lb/>The MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global <lb/>1 km and 500 m sinusoidal grid (MOD09GA and MYD09GA), Version <lb/>6 was used to retrieve MODIS SIC (details in Section 3.1). The Level 2G <lb/>format was developed by mapping Level 2 granules onto a geolocated grid <lb/>based on sinusoidal projection without compositing and averaging results. <lb/>The grid consists of 460 nonoverlapping tiles which measure approximately <lb/>10° × 10°. Each tile can be located by its horizontal and vertical indices. For <lb/>the Central Arctic, we downloaded four tiles: h16v00, h17v00, h18v00, and <lb/>h19v00. <lb/>The first step to retrieve MODIS SIC was to re-project L2G MODIS surface reflectance maps on a 1 km polar <lb/>stereographic grid and generate one mosaic map covering the Central Arctic from the four tiles. Cloud infor-<lb/>mation was then derived from the Quality Assessment (QA) values to generate the cloud mask for the mosaic <lb/>map. Secondly, the SICs within clear sky pixels were derived using the methodology described in Section 3.1. <lb/>After obtaining 1 km MODIS SIC, the data were remapped into the coarsest resolution cells (12.5 km). SIC data <lb/>sets at finer resolutions, that is, Bremen, OSI-401 and OSI-408, were downscaled into the 12.5 km grid as well. <lb/>Once all data sets had the same projection and grid scale, the median value of each 12.5 km cell was calculated to <lb/>generate the multi-product ensemble (MPE) SIC field which was used for intercomparisons. <lb/>Figure 3 shows the four remapped SIC maps and their median field (MPE-SIC) for 1 July 2008. All images are on <lb/>12.5 km polar stereographic grids. We overlayed the MODIS cloud mask on PM SIC maps to display the common <lb/>cloud-free, blind-hole-free regions, so the shape of MODIS tile is outlined on the polar stereographic grids. For <lb/>our study, we only use data within the 84°N, so the shape of the tile would not impact analyses. The invalid pixels, <lb/>that is, North Pole blind holes and pixels in the cloud mask are black, and the exterior regions are colored brown. <lb/>The mean deviation of satellite derived SICs with respect to the reference inside the 84°N circle was calculated. <lb/>The deviation distribution and root mean square error (RMSE) of the samples were statistically analyzed, as well <lb/>as further inspection of the human-derived accuracy labels was conducted. <lb/>Figure 3.

        <body>4. Results <lb/>4.1. SIC LICI Time Series <lb/>From LICI plots of 2002-2019 (Figures 4-6), the maximum LICI usually appears in September when the Arctic <lb/>SIE reaches its annual minimum (Shu et al., 2020). Strong inter-annual variability of LICI is demonstrated, for <lb/>instance, all data sets have low values in 2014/2015 and consistently high values in 2016/2017. Since 2007, the <lb/>LICI profiles of ERA5, MERRA-2 and OSI-401 almost overlay each other and provide near identical depictions <lb/>of sea ice change. Another interesting feature is that, during 2007-2012, the LICI peaks of ERA5 and MERRA-2 <lb/>always appear later than those of OSI-401 by a constant time interval. Though OSI-408 data are available from <lb/>September 2016 to 2019, profiles of two years (2018 and 2019) demonstrate similar patterns to those of OSI-401. <lb/>The LICI disparities among OSI-401, Bremen, and NSIDC data sets are distinct for the years 2005, 2008, 2009, <lb/>and 2011. Bremen and NSIDC usually have moderate values of LICI peaks which mean smaller areas of low <lb/>concentration estimates in the Central Arctic. Their highest peaks usually appear later than for the other products, <lb/>in late August and September. <lb/>Figure 7 summarizes the evolution of the summer LICI starting in 2002. The x-axis is selected summer periods <lb/>(June-October) from 2002 to 2019. The y-axis indicates the six SIC products. There are several missing days of <lb/>OSI-401, Bremen, and NSIDC, so gaps can be seen along their timelines-the most evident one is from October <lb/>2011 to June 2012, the observation time gap between AMSR-E and AMSR2. This plot also reveals the similarity <lb/>Figure 4. 2002-2007 LICI time series. Starting in 2002: Blue line: Bremen. Pink line: NSIDC. Green line: ERA5. Light blue <lb/>line: MERRA-2.

        <body>among LICIs of ERA5, MERRA-2 and OSI-401, both in magnitude and occurrence. Furthermore, in some years, <lb/>such as 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2019, the prominent LICI values of these three products are not apparent in the <lb/>Bremen and NSIDC. <lb/>4.2. Cross-Correlation of SIC LICIs <lb/>CC was calculated for 18-year LICIs, providing the general relationships among various SIC products. The <lb/>correlation matrix is shown in Table 3 which provides quantitative results of the linear relationship between <lb/>every pair of SIC products. LICIs of two reanalysis data sets and OSI-401 have high positive correlations (r OSI-<lb/>401,ERA5 = 0.95, r OSI-401,MERRA-2 = 0.94, r MERRA-2,ERA5 = 0.96). The next highest CCs are OSI-408 with the reanalysis <lb/>data sets MERRA-2 (0.81) and ERA5 (0.83), and with the methodologically similar data set OSI-401 (0.84). <lb/>NSIDC and OSI-408 have the lowest CC (0.37), indicating the NT2 and the TUD algorithms show significant <lb/>discrepancies with each other. The CCs of the Bremen data set show consistent values from 0.68 to 0.74. The <lb/>NSIDC CCs are in most cases lower (from 0.37 to 0.61), with the exception Bremen (0.68). <lb/>Annual TLCC analyses were used to elucidate whether &quot;leader-follower&quot; relationships exist between OSI-401 and <lb/>ERA5 (MERRA-2). We only selected OSI-401 because we observed that the LICI time series of OSI-401, ERA5, <lb/>and MERRA-2 demonstrate almost the same patterns from 2013 onwards, but with a little temporal offset from <lb/>2008 to 2012 (OSI-401 vs. ERA5) and 2007 to 2012 (OSI-401 vs. MERRA-2). The TLCC peak value can infer <lb/>the temporal offset between two LICI time series at a specific year. LICI of Bremen, NSIDC, and OSI-408 were <lb/>Figure 5. 2008-2013 LICI time series.

        <body>excluded from the TLCC analysis due to a lack of correlation and temporal <lb/>alignment with the reanalysis data sets. The TLCC results indicate that the <lb/>peak correlation of OSI-401 and two reanalyzes SIC LICIs may appear with <lb/>a 1-day offset (top panels of Figures 8 and 9). So, we can infer that OSI-401 <lb/>has been leading ERA5 (MERRA-2) since 2008 (2007) to 2012, and these <lb/>&quot;leader-follower&quot; relationships end in 2013. We suspect that the regular time <lb/>shift before 2013 probably comes from the confusion of zero-based number-<lb/>ing and one-based numbering of year-day when indexing input SIC product. <lb/>Note that certain years, such as 2006 with an offset of 45 days and 2019 with <lb/>an offset of 90 days, display elevated correlations. This could be attributed to <lb/>either multiple peaks in LICC or recurring variation patterns. <lb/>We can conclude the similarity of ERA5 and MERRA-2 SICs falls into three <lb/>distinct periods: (a). 2002-2006, when they have different inputs of remote-sensing SIC and the LICI is an inde-<lb/>pendent feature; (b). 2007/2008-2012, LICIs are highly correlated but reveal a 1-day offset compared to OSI-401 <lb/>LICI; (c). 2013-2019, LICI of ERA5 and MERRA-2 show near identical patterns as OSI-401. Both reanalysis <lb/>SICs appear to be directly derived by interpolation of the OSI-401 fields into their target grids. Thus, we should <lb/>not expect that reanalysis SICs to have improved accuracy compared to PM SICs. <lb/>The LICIs of ERA5, MERRA-2 and OSI-401 are highly correlated which also indicates both reanalysis products <lb/>introduce little improvement to OSI-401. Hence, ERA5 LICI peaks can be used as a representative of the other <lb/>highly correlated time series for the next step, which is accuracy assessment. <lb/>Bremen MERRA-2 NSIDC OSI-401 OSI-408 ERA5 <lb/>Bremen <lb/>1 <lb/>0.74 <lb/>0.68 <lb/>0.71 <lb/>0.73 <lb/>0.74 <lb/>MERRA-2 <lb/>1 <lb/>0.61 <lb/>0.94 <lb/>0.81 <lb/>0.96 <lb/>NSIDC <lb/>1 <lb/>0.57 <lb/>0.37 <lb/>0.59 <lb/>OSI-401 <lb/>1 <lb/>0.84 <lb/>0.95 <lb/>OSI-408 <lb/>1 <lb/>0.83 <lb/>ERA5 <lb/>1 <lb/>Table 3 <lb/>Pearson&apos;s Correlation Coefficients of 2002-2019 LICI Time Series <lb/>Figure 8.

        <body>4.3. Evaluation Through Human Inspection <lb/>During 2002-2019, there are 96 ERA5 LICI peaks of which 65 have available matches with composite true-color <lb/>imagery from MODIS and VIIRS. As a result of human-inspection, 35 of 65 daily ERA5 SIC estimates are <lb/>considered Accurate, 29 are identified as Underestimated, and one case is Overestimated. The comparisons are <lb/>summarized in Table 4. <lb/>Bremen has 48 LICI peaks in the same time period. The number of peaks is half that of ERA5 and 37 peaks match <lb/>with valid MODIS and VIIRS imagery.

        <body>OSI-408 is available for only the last four years of the study, and 13 peaks are used in the comparison. The <lb/>percentage of Accurate cases is 77%. Underestimated cases account for 23%. This is better than ERA5, but worse <lb/>than Bremen and NSIDC. <lb/>Based on SIC estimates from the spatial distribution shown in the composite true-color imagery, all SIC products <lb/>tend to underestimate summer ice concentration, but SIC products retrieved from AMSR-E/AMSR2 Tb have <lb/>better performance compared to reanalysis SIC products, though Bremen, NSIDC, and OSI-408 use three differ-<lb/>ent retrieval algorithms and are at various spatial resolutions. <lb/>4.4. Evaluation Using MODIS SIE <lb/>Since the cloud mask used in MODIS SIE product has a 14.2% false positive rate (false cloud) and 7.1% false <lb/>negative rate (missing cloud) during polar day in summer (Frey et al., 2019), we have fewer cloud-free pixels <lb/>identified than occur in nature and fewer reference samples to be used in the validation. <lb/>The comparisons with MODIS SIE used as the reference are summarized in Table 5. ERA5, Bremen and NSIDC <lb/>have similar outcomes compared to the values in Table 4, but lower accuracies. The relatively low accuracy <lb/>probably results from the difference between the MODIS sea ice identification method based on NDSI and PM <lb/>SIC algorithms using Tb properties. As for OSI-408, all seven cases are considered as Inaccurate. This result is <lb/>inconsistent with 77% Accuracy of the human-inspection, which may be due to the false positives in cloud mask-<lb/>ing, as well as a small sample size. <lb/>4.5. Evaluation Based on Ensemble SIC (MPE-SIC) <lb/>We summarized LICI peaks for ERA5, Bremen, NSIDC, and OSI-408 and there is a total of 75 LICI peak cases. <lb/>The scatter plot (Figure 10) shows the deviations of 75 cases with respect to the median fields, excluding 14 cases <lb/>with data error, illumination issues, or cloud contamination. The OSI-401 (orange) and OSI-408 (dark gray) <lb/>points almost all lie below zero, which means these two products usually have lower ice concentrations than the <lb/>median values.

        <body>tend to have higher estimates of SICs. The deviations of MODIS-derived SIC (light gray) have a complicated <lb/>distribution, ranging from -10% to +10%. <lb/>The box plot (Figure 11) summarizes the information in Figure 10. The minima and maxima outside the first and <lb/>third quartiles are depicted with lines and the median is marked by the line in each box. The black cross denotes <lb/>the mean value. An outlier is identified if it exceeds 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) below the first quartile <lb/>or 1.5 times the IQR above the third quartile. We further group the MODIS SIC statistics into two clusters based <lb/>on the PM SIC accuracy on the same day. The first cluster is under the condition that the PM SIC at LICI peak <lb/>is Accurate. For example, if LICI of Bremen shows a peak on 2008/07/01 and our human inspection identifies it <lb/>is Accurate, then the MODIS SIC on 2008/07/01 will be in the first cluster. There are 35 cases in the first cluster <lb/>and the mean of MODIS SIC deviations of these 35 cases with respect to MPE is -2.1%. The second cluster is <lb/>under the condition that PM SIC at LICI peak is Inaccurate (most are underestimation according to Table 4) and <lb/>contains 21 cases, the mean deviation is +1.3%. Rösel and Kaleschke (2012a) investigated the effects of melt <lb/>ponds on PM SICs in the Canadian Archipelago on 18 June 2011 and presented SIC maps derived from MODIS <lb/>and AMSR-E using ASI, NT2 and Bootstrap algorithms. In the areas without melt ponds identified in MODIS <lb/>data, the PM SICs were larger than the MODIS SIC. Thus, a reason for the mean negative deviation and large <lb/>variance of the MODIS SIC compared to the MPE-SIC in our analysis is likely to be that SICs derived from <lb/>MODIS are smaller than the PM SICs in regions free of melt ponds. <lb/>The mean of Bremen and NSIDC deviations are 1.06% and 0.99%, respectively and the greatest negative deviation <lb/>is around -6%. The standard deviation of NSIDC is a little larger than that of Bremen, excluding the outliers. The <lb/>mean deviations of OSI-401 and OSI-408 are -6.65% and -4.64%, respectively. <lb/>The RMSE of the five SICs with respect to the MPE-SIC are: MODIS (4.44%), Bremen (3.57%), NSIDC (3.48%), <lb/>OSI-401 (8.15%) and OSI-408 (6.86%). The Bremen and NSIDC SICs have small RMSEs, in accordance with <lb/>results in Sections 4.3 and 4.4. <lb/>5. Discussion <lb/>Accurate SIC measurement is necessary in terms of monitoring, understanding, and modeling Arctic Amplifica-<lb/>tion. PM SIC products provide daily distribution of ice cover and open water, determining the regions where SST <lb/>can be estimated. Although the surface temperature of ice and water can be very close in the summer melt season, <lb/>their different albedos result in contrasting levels of solar radiation absorption and distinct contributions to the <lb/>Arctic radiation budget. By incorporating SIC into climate models, scientists can better understand the mecha-<lb/>nisms of surface energy budget and project future Arctic warming. Our study provides a comprehensive compar-<lb/>ison and evaluation of four PM and two reanalysis SIC data sets. The limitations of this study are as follows. <lb/>Figure 11. Box plot of deviations of the LICI cases of five satellite-derived SIC products with respect to the MPE-SIC. The <lb/>mean is marked by a cross.

        <body>1. The statistics of SIC accuracy assessments are influenced by several factors including the size and random-<lb/>ness of the sample. In this study, we detect peaks of LICI time series and assign multiple peaks that happened <lb/>within 7 days as one low SIC event. For different SIC products, we have different numbers of events that are <lb/>used in the accuracy validation. Larger sample sizes tend to produce higher confidence level results and vice <lb/>versa. Another influence relevant to low SIC samples is that we cannot prevent missing matches due to the <lb/>unavailability of optical imagery. <lb/>2. Since we derive SIC from MODIS surface reflectance, the values are, to some extent, sensitive to the selec-<lb/>tions of reflectance thresholds for water and ice. We also recognize that the effects of clouds may have impacts <lb/>on the validation when using SIC estimated from MODIS SIE and broadband albedo. We assume that the <lb/>geophysical value of pixels under clouds within a retrieval grid could be represented by the value of adjacent <lb/>or nearby clear-sky pixels. This may also introduce errors into the SIC from MODIS and MPE-SIC. <lb/>3. Another limitation of this study is that using MPE-SIC as reference might provide biased results since this <lb/>is not perfect independent validation data, though this method is good at identifying individual outliers and <lb/>algorithms that give &quot;out-of-family&quot; results. <lb/>Nevertheless, these assessments have several significant consequences for future sea ice studies. <lb/>1. Many sea ice studies used MODIS-derived SIC as the reference to validate the accuracy of PM SICs (Cavalieri <lb/>et al., 2010; Rösel &amp; Kaleschke, 2012b; Shi &amp; Su, 2018). However, the limitations of the MODIS SICs, such <lb/>as being prone to underestimate ice cover when the ice is thin (Ludwig et al., 2020), should be kept in mind in <lb/>evaluating their analyses as well as ours. <lb/>2. Even though all PM SIC algorithms appear likely to underestimate ice cover with very high concentration <lb/>values, the likelihood varies with algorithms more than with sensors. The BF and Bristol SIC algorithms <lb/>appear to be more sensitive to a wetter surface condition, indicating that algorithms using Tb gradient differ-<lb/>ence and polarization difference at low frequencies may not correctly retrieve SIC in the presence of melt <lb/>ponds. The ASI and NT2 algorithms which utilize polarization ratio (PR) at 89 or 85 GHz provide more <lb/>Accurate matches with respect to the validating data. Thus, the polarization difference or polarization ratio at <lb/>high frequencies are probably more robust when the surface becomes wetter in summer. But the modification <lb/>by a linear expression of the 85 GHz polarization difference in the TUD algorithm seems inadequate. Future <lb/>work could use radiative transfer models to investigate the sensitivity of PM Tb to the presence and area of <lb/>melt ponds and the effectiveness of tie points in ASI and NT2 algorithms. <lb/>3. Further, a more fundamental question is how to exploit the strengths of optical and microwave sensors to <lb/>obtain PM SIC retrievals with errors consistently &lt;10%? A traditional approach is to improve the algorithm <lb/>by tuning the tie points for sea ice, but the outcomes vary spatially and temporally (Hao &amp; Su, 2015). Since <lb/>MODIS SIC is derived from a few optical channels with 500 m resolution, some physical mechanisms related <lb/>to the sea ice features, such as melt ponds, can probably be better described. If we can use collocated MODIS <lb/>and PM images to build a training data set, machine learning methods may offer a means of classifying open <lb/>water and different types of sea ice with little concern about tie point selection (Chi et al., 2019). Ludwig <lb/>et al. (2019) merged MODIS SIC and AMSR2 SIC by each 5 km by 5 km box-if MODIS data are availa-<lb/>ble, the grid value is the MODIS SIC plus the difference between the mean of MODIS SIC and the mean of <lb/>AMSR2 SIC; if MODIS are not available, the grid value is the AMSR2 SIC. The merged SIC provides another <lb/>approach that can be used as an ensemble SIC to investigate the evolution of melt ponds. <lb/>6. Conclusions <lb/>Comparisons of summer-time CAO sea-ice fields derived from PM and optical remote sensing data show similarities, <lb/>but also marked differences. The differences are dependent not only on the method of measurements but also on the <lb/>algorithms to derive the sea-ice fields, especially on ice surface properties, including the presence of melt-ponds. The <lb/>extent of low sea-ice concentrations in the summer CAO was investigated using Low sea-Ice Concentration Index <lb/>(LICI) time series calculated from four PM products and two reanalysis data sets (Figures 4-6). Pearson&apos;s correlation <lb/>coefficients (CC, Table 3) indicate that LICIs of OSI-401, OSI-408, ERA5 and MERRA-2 fields are highly correlated <lb/>(&gt;0.8), while correlations of other sets range between 0.37 and 0.74. The LICI time series in together with the results <lb/>of Time Lagged Correlation Coefficients (TLCC, Figures 8 and 9) show the development of reanalysis SIC products: <lb/>a) 2002-2006, ERA5 and MERRA-2 have different inputs of PM SIC and the LICIs have independent features. <lb/>b) 2007/2008-2012, LICIs are highly correlated but indicate 1-day offset compared to OSI-401 LICI. <lb/></body>

        <body>c. 2013-2019, LICI of ERA5 and MERRA-2 show identical patterns as the OSI-401 from which we can infer that <lb/>both reanalysis SICs directly interpolate OSI-401 into their target grids. <lb/>The accuracies of low ice concentration cases with respect to three reference fields in the CAO in the summers <lb/>from 2002 to 2019 were evaluated. Results regarding the likelihood of a SIC product misinterpreting summer ice <lb/>cover are summarized in Table 6. <lb/>Using SIC estimates from the sea ice distribution shown in the optical imagery as the reference, all PM SIC prod-<lb/>ucts were found to underestimate ice fraction (Table 4). The Accurate cases of ERA5 only account for 53.9%. SIC <lb/>products retrieved from AMSR-E/AMSR2, that is, using the Bremen, NSIDC, and OSI-408 algorithms, provide <lb/>higher accuracies 83.8%, 70.4%, and 76.9%). <lb/>MODIS SIE was used as the validation reference revealing all PM and reanalysis SICs have less Accurate cases: <lb/>ERA5 (36%), Bremen (69%), NSIDC (53%), OSI-408 (0%). When compared to human inspections, the accuracy <lb/>values are lower. This may result from the reduced amount of LICI peak cases which are able to be matched with <lb/>cloud-free MODIS SIE, as well as the ice identification method employed in the MODIS SIE product. <lb/>We also estimate SIC from MODIS broadband surface albedo and obtain a median SIC field from PM SICs and <lb/>MODIS-derived SIC. Using the median field as a representative reference, the ice concentration deviations of each <lb/>product were analyzed. From 64 valid cases, the majority of Bremen and NSIDC deviations are positive meaning <lb/>they are likely to produce higher ice concentrations than the median. The mean deviations of Bremen (1.06%) and <lb/>NSIDC (0.99%) are small. In contrast, OSI-401 and OSI-408 are prone to have lower values of ice concentration and <lb/>their mean deviations are -6.65% and -4.64%, respectively. The errors of MODIS-derived SIC have a complicated <lb/>pattern with a mean deviation -0.8%, but this results from the compensation of two clusters in which (a) PM SIC <lb/>is Accurate/Overestimated, and (b) PM SIC is Inaccurate/Underestimated, giving mean deviations of these clusters <lb/>MODIS SIC of -2.1% and +1.3% compared to the median. This probably indicates that ice concentrations derived <lb/>from MODIS could have distinct biases due to the influence of ice thickness (Ludwig et al., 2020) and melt pond <lb/>fractions (Kern et al., 2020). The root mean square errors (RMSE) of these five SICs with respect to the MPE-SIC <lb/>are: MODIS (4.44%), Bremen (3.57%), NSIDC (3.48%), OSI-401 (8.15%) and OSI-408 (6.86%) (Table 6). <lb/>The recognition that the properties of SIC in the central Arctic Ocean is an important factor in the response of <lb/>the changing Arctic, and that satellite remote sensing is the only feasible method of monitoring the seasonal and <lb/>interannual changes, we have quantified the accuracies of several widely used SIC products. We have introduced <lb/>the concept of a median SIC field as a reference. Our results could guide future analyses and interpretations of <lb/>the satellite-derived SICs. <lb/></body>
