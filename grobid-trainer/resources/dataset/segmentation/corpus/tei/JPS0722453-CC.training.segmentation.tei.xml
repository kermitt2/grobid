			<front>59 Co-NMR Knight Shift of Superconducting Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O <lb/>Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Mai Yokoi and Masatoshi Sato <lb/>Department of Physics, Division of Material Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku <lb/>Nagoya, 464-8602 Japan <lb/>(Received June 12, 2003) <lb/>Layered Co oxide Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O with the superconducting transition temperature T c =4.5 K has <lb/>been studied by 59 Co-NMR. The Knight shift K estimated from the observed spectra for powder <lb/>sample exhibits almost temperature(T)-independent behavior above T c and decreases with decreasing T <lb/>below T c .

			<body>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the layered cobalt oxide Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O 1) has attracted <lb/>much attention, because it has the triangular lattice of Co atoms. The system can be obtained from <lb/>Na x CoO 2 by deintercalating Na + ions and simultaneous intercalating H 2 O molecules. The <lb/>superconducting transition temperature T c was reported to be ~5 K. Up to now, v arious kinds of <lb/>experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanism of the <lb/>superconductivity 1-16) . <lb/>In the previous report, the present authors ha ve shown by 59 Co-NQR studies of the system, that the <lb/>coherence peak of the 59 Co-nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/T 1 exists just below T c . It has been also <lb/>pointed out, based on detailed comparison of the relaxation rates 1/T 1 and the magnetic susceptibilities <lb/>χ between Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O and Na x CoO 2 that the former system is closer to the ferromagnetic phase <lb/>than the latter 7) . <lb/>In the present paper, the temperature (T) dependence of Knight shift K studied by 59 Co-NMR of <lb/>Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O is reported. Then, based on the observed behaviors of K and 1/T 1 , the paring symmetry <lb/>is argued. <lb/>The powder sample of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O with T c ~4.5 K was prepared from Na 0.75 CoO 2 by the method <lb/>described in Ref. 1. The structural and magnetic properties of the sample were reported in the previous <lb/>paper 7) . The NMR experiments were carried out using a standard phase coherent type pulse <lb/>spectrometer. 59 Co NMR spectra were obtained by recording the spin-echo intensity with the applied <lb/>magnetic field changed step by step in a magnetic field range of 1-2 T. Measurements were carried out <lb/>on two kinds of samples of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O, randomly oriented and aligned samples. The latter sample <lb/>was prepared by mixing the Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O powder with epoxy adhesive (Stycast 1266) and keeping <lb/>the mixture in a magnetic field of 11T at room temperature for ~12 h. Its X ray diffraction pattern <lb/>indicates that the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O crystallites align along the direction of the magnetic field <lb/>with the spreading of about (±6°). ( The lattice parameter c was found not to exhibit significant change <lb/>after the alignment processes, which indicates no drastic change of the structure.) The former sample <lb/>does not have epoxy adhesive. It was just put into a cylindrical holder made by cellophane tapes. The <lb/>obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) for randomly oriented powder and aligned samples, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>The positions of the peaks and shoulders of the 59 Co-NMR spectra observed for both kinds of <lb/>samples were well explained by considering the anisotropic Knight shifts K x ≠ K y ≠ K z ≠ K x and the <lb/>effects of electric quadrupole interaction up to the second order. The directions of the principal axes of <lb/>Knight shift are assumed to be same as those of the electric quadrupole interaction. In the present case, <lb/>the z-axis was defined along the direction, for which the component of the electric quadrupole tensor, <lb/>ν zz is larger than the other components. This z direction was found to be along the c-axis by fitting the <lb/>positions of calculated spectra to those of aligned sample. The fitted result for the data taken at 5 K in <lb/>the magnetic field H within the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O is shown in Fig. 1(b) and the parameters <lb/></body>

			<body>determined by the fitting are, K x = ~3.5±0.1 %, K y = ~3.1±0.05 %, the electric quadrupole resonance <lb/>frequency ν Q =3.6±0.05 MHz and the asymmetric parameter of the electric field gradient at nuclei <lb/>η=0.28±0.02. For the spectra of the randomly oriented sample, K x = ~3.8±0.1 %, K y = ~3.14±0.05 %, <lb/>K z = ~2.3±0.2 %, ν Q =4.05±0.05 MHz and η=0.24±0.01 were found to reproduce them well. The <lb/>comparison of the values of ν Q and η of the aligned sample with those of the randomly oriented one <lb/>justifies the present assignment of the z direction along the c axis. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the T dependence of the 59 Co-NMR spectra around the peak of central line for the <lb/>randomly oriented powder sample. The H value of the peak position is nearly T-independent above T c <lb/>(~4.5 K) and then increases with decreasing T below T c . This change of the peak position is due to the <lb/>T dependence of the Knight shift K y and not due to the second order effect of the electrical quadrupole <lb/>interaction, because ν Q and η are T-independent, as was confirmed by analyzing the spectra in the H <lb/>region between 0.8-2.4 T at 2.9 K, 4.7 K and 6.2 K. <lb/>It should be noted here following facts. For the aligned sample, the peak position of the central line <lb/>of the 59 Co-NMR spectra, which corresponds to K y , is nearly T-independent even below T c . It is <lb/>slightly puzzling, because the result indicates that the T dependence of K y of the aligned sample is <lb/>different from that of the powder sample. To explain this puzzle, we consider that the shift K y observed <lb/>in ref. 8 for a sample aligned in epoxy adhesive (Stycast) also exhibits the T-independent behavior. We <lb/>think that the specimens embedded in the Stycast have somewhat different properties from those of the <lb/>(non-aligned) samples. This idea is supported by the fact that we have observed different values of K x <lb/>between the two kinds of samples, which has already been stated above. Then, the data of the aligned <lb/>sample may not be intrinsic. <lb/>We have estimated the K y value of the (non-aligned) powder sample. The results are shown in Fig. 3. <lb/>Above T c , K y is nearly constant and decreases with decreasing T below T c . Because we have already <lb/>taken into account the effect of the electrical quadrupole interaction up to the second order in the <lb/>estimation of K y , the decrease of K y below T c with decreasing T should be due to the T dependence of <lb/>its spin component K spin,y and/or due to the effect of the shielding diamagnetism (The orbital <lb/>component K orb , y may be T-independent.) Here, in order to estimate the change of the magnetic field at <lb/>the Co nuclei by the shielding supercurrent, we consider the case where the H is applied along the y <lb/>direction, i.e., within the a-b plane of the crystallites, because we are observing K y . For the penetration <lb/>depth λ of 5000~8000 Å at low temperatures, 3,6) we expect that the reduction of the field is roughly <lb/>one order of magnitude smaller that the observed shift of the peak. It has been confirmed by the <lb/>following experimental observation. Even when the measuring frequency is changed from 16.09 MHz <lb/>to 30.044 MHz, the Knight shift does not change within the experimental error bars, indicating that the <lb/>spatial variation of the field or the shielding effect is negligible in the present experimental condition. <lb/>It is also confirmed by studying experimental observations for the similar two-dimensional system <lb/>YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 with λ (~1400 Å at T&lt;&lt;T c ) larger than that of the present system does not have a serious <lb/></body>

			<body>effect of the shielding diamagnetism in the vortex state (at H=7.4 T). 17) Furthermore, it can be noted <lb/>that the shape of the peak corresponding to K y does not exhibit an appreciable change expected in the <lb/>case where the spatial variation of H induced by the shielding diamagnetism is a main cause of the <lb/>shift. <lb/>We have just tried to fit the K y -T curve below T c by the Yosida function 18) (see the solid curve in <lb/>Fig. 3) and obtained the superconducting energy gap ∆ of 8.1 K. For the value and T c =4.5 K, 2∆/k B T c <lb/>is estimated to be 3.6, which agrees well with the one expected from the BCS theory, though the rather <lb/>good fitting by the Yosida function may be accidental. To estimate K spin,y precisely, we have to know <lb/>the orbital component K orb , y , which is, at this moment, not easy. <lb/>Now, we have shown that the spin susceptibility χ spin of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O studied by measuring the <lb/>Knight shift K y decreases with decreasing T in the superconducting state. The existence of the <lb/>coherence peak of the nuclear relaxation rate 1/T 1 just below T c has also been reported in the previous <lb/>paper by the present authors. 7) These results indicate, naively speaking, that the superconducting pairs <lb/>of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O are in the singlet spin state with s-wave symmetry, though other possibilities may <lb/>not be completely ruled out: Strictly speaking, the (d 1 +id 2 ) state predicted in refs. 10-13 may have a <lb/>small coherence peak. Then, the precise calculation of the amplitude of the coherence peak is required <lb/>to exclude such the symmetry. Even for the p-wave state predicted in refs. 14 and 15, the decrease of <lb/>K spin ,y can be expected, if the direction of the triplet spins is pinned in the direction perpendicular to the <lb/>y-axis. At this moment, we do not know how strong the pinning force is. To answer this question, <lb/>further studies on the anisotropy of the Knight shift has to be carried out by using single crystal <lb/>specimens. <lb/>In summary, the T dependence of the Knight shift K y of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O has been reported. For the <lb/>(non-aligned) powder sample, the T dependence of the spin component K spin,y roughly follows the <lb/>Yosida function in the superconducting state. This behavior and the existence of the coherence peak in <lb/>the 1/T 1 -T curve observed just below T c indicate that Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O has the spin singlet pairs with the <lb/>s-wave symmetry, though the observed results do not completely exclude the possibility of other kinds <lb/>of electron pair state. <lb/></body>
