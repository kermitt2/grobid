[Subjects and Methods] Forty eight subjects (Underwater walking group=25, Overground walk-<lb/>ing group=23) completed the experiment. Healthy subjects with no orthopedic history of lower extremity injuries <lb/>were recruited. Gait training is performed using the underwater treadmill consisted of 30-minute walking sessions, <lb/>five times per week for four weeks.

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Balancing ability is defined as the ability to maintain the body&apos;s center of gravity while minimizing sway in the base of <lb/>support. Postural balance, on the other hand, indicates the ability to continuously retain balance in accordance with the center <lb/>of mass (COM) and movement, and to maintain the proper postural control against actions and external rocking within the <lb/>base of support 1, 2) . Gait training is a common method of improving the balancing ability. It is recommended for aerobic <lb/>capacity improvement, body fat reduction, lowering the blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving gait and <lb/>balancing abilities 3) . Research testing the effects of gait training examines types and speed of walking. Underwater walking <lb/>training is special in that it provides a work-out environment of reduced gravity with the use of the buoyancy of water 3) . <lb/>Water workouts relieve stress from weight on the joints, enhances muscular function without imposing excessive impact to <lb/>the muscle, and improves flexibility and balance 4) . <lb/>Most research has focused on gait training in the ground, and there are very few investigations of underwater walking <lb/>training and its effects on balancing ability 3, 4) . Given this background, this study examines the effects of underwater walking <lb/>training on the healthy subjects balancing ability. <lb/>SUBJECTS AND METHODS <lb/>Forty eight subjects (Underwater walking group=25, Overground walking group=23) completed the experiment. The <lb/>characteristics of the two groups (n=48) before and after intervention are shown in Table 1. The selection criteria were <lb/>as follows: no history of orthopedic surgery on a lower limb, never taken any drug due to a neurologic problem, and no <lb/>musculoskeletal system disease. In underwater and overground walking training groups average ages, heights, and weights <lb/>were 20.14 ± 1.27, 21.37 ± 1.41 years, 174.16 ± 10.17, 172.54 ± 8.67 cm, and 72.35 ± 6.58, 68.94 ± 7.84 kg, respectively. <lb/></body>

			<body>Sufficient explanation of this study&apos;s intent and the overall purpose was given, and voluntary consent to participate in this <lb/>study was obtained from all of the subjects. Information on the study and written informed consent according to the ethical <lb/>standards of the Declaration of Helsinki were provided to all subjects prior to their participation. <lb/>The trials consisted of underwater and overground walking training. The subjects either walked on an underwater tread-<lb/>mill (HydroTrack ® Underwater Treadmill System, Conray, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) or walked on an overground treadmill <lb/>(HL-1100, Healthlife, Korea). The water temperature was set at about 33 °C and the depth was fixed to reach up between the <lb/>subjects&apos; xiphoid process and the navel. The speed of the treadmill was limited to a maximum velocity of 2-4 m/s in both <lb/>groups 4) . The both group consisted of 30-minute walking sessions, five times per week for four weeks. <lb/>After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure <lb/>each subject&apos;s balance ability 5) . The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the <lb/>balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject <lb/>was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual <lb/>fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject&apos;s arms were placed comfortably <lb/>at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open. <lb/>COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing <lb/>the quantitative aspects of individual&apos;s test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, <lb/>amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of <lb/>pressure), power spectrum analysis (FFT analysis) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies <lb/>excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater <lb/>balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a <lb/>prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation. <lb/>The mean and SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention, differences in the general characteristics <lb/>of the experimental group were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Variables were compared before and after training within <lb/>experimental group using paired sample t-tests. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, <lb/>USA), and statistical significance was accepted for p values &lt;0.05 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>The underwater walking training showed significant increases in all variance after intervention (p&lt;0.05). Significant inter-<lb/>group differences in post-training gains were observed for all varience (p&lt;0.05). The effect sizes of gains in the underwater <lb/>and overground walking training were high for medial-lateral and anterior-posterior locus length, balance function indices <lb/>(effect sizes 0.84, 1.11, and 0.96, respectively) (Table 1). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study assessed underwater walking training on healthy subjects, and the results showed a positive effect on balancing <lb/>ability. An earlier study found that a stretching exercise increased balancing ability in healthy subjects 5) .When a person moves <lb/>in the water, buoyancy and resistance of the water induce rocking of posture. This body movement activates proprioception <lb/>to maintain upright posture 6) . Movement in the water allows easier application of open and closed kinetic chain exercise than <lb/>on the ground. <lb/>In the present study, a variable-speed underwater treadmill training with adjustable water depth and frontal resistance <lb/>provided by pump-driven directional water jets has been used as a novel mode of aquatic exercise. This system theoretically <lb/>provides a more favorable mode of exercise for the overweight and obese, in that walking or jogging intensity (velocity and <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>resistance) can be controlled, whereas the buoyancy of water reduces the impact force of ambulation 7) . <lb/>Other researchers have previously investigated, physical function and walking ability were improved in adults with in-<lb/>complete spinal cord injury following a structured program of underwater treadmill training featuring individualized levels <lb/>of body weight support and carefully staged increases in speed and duration 4) . From a clinical perspective, these findings <lb/>highlight the potential of underwater treadmill training in persons with physical disabilities and diseases that would benefit <lb/>from weight-supported exercise. <lb/>Underwater walking training provides a treatment environment that is psychologically stable. The physical nature of water <lb/>presents advantages in improving muscular strength and endurance, motion range of joints, increase in cardiopulmonary <lb/>abilities, and improving the quality of life, as gait and balancing ability improve 8) . When adults with arthritis were treated <lb/>with underwater walking training, their balancing ability and motion range of joints improved 9) . It appears that buoyancy, <lb/>temperature, and other qualities of water stimulated proprioception and decreased postural rocking. <lb/>The underwater treadmill training has been used most frequently as a treatment modality in sports injury or orthopedic <lb/>rehabilitation settings and has only recently been used with obese individuals. Therefore, further clinical controlled studies <lb/>with larger sample sizes and longer interventions should be carried out to validate the clinical benefits of the underwater <lb/>walking. <lb/></body>
