Campbell <lb/>Avenue, Tucson AZ 85724 <lb/>Correspondance: marthab1@email.arizona.edu <lb/> 2 <lb/> Summary <lb/>Nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) convey sensations of <lb/>pain and itch to the spinal cord, respectively. A sub-population of these neurons, marked by <lb/>Somatostatin (Sst) expression, is responsible for detecting the cytokine IL-31, a mediator of <lb/>acute itch and atopic dermatitis. The mechanisms responsible for specifying this population are <lb/>largely unknown. Here we show that Tmem184b, a gene with known roles in axon degeneration <lb/>and nerve terminal maintenance, is required for the expression of a substantial cohort of <lb/>receptors, including IL31RA, that mediate acute itch. Mice lacking Tmem184b fail to respond to <lb/>IL-31, but maintain normal responses to pain and mechanical force, suggesting a specific defect <lb/>in pruriception. The number of Sst + neurons is reduced in Tmem184b-mutant mice, indicating a <lb/>likely defect in neuron subtype specification. Rescue experiments in adults versus embryonic <lb/>neurons support a primary role for TMEM184B during development. We evaluated DRG gene <lb/>expression across embryonic and early postnatal development and found that levels of Wnt <lb/>signaling components are significantly reduced in embryonic DRG from Tmem184b-mutants <lb/> and restored upon re-expression of Tmem184b. In summary, we have identified a mechanism <lb/>controlled by TMEM184B that gates proper specification of pruriceptive neurons in the DRG <lb/>through control of Wnt signaling. TMEM184B is thus critical for proper pruriceptive development <lb/>and adult somatosensation. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Somatosensory neurons transduce multiple types of stimuli, including temperature, <lb/>chemical, and physical changes in the local environment of their nerve endings. Nerve endings <lb/>receiving these cues can also directly sense inflammatory compounds, and this inflammation <lb/>alters their response properties to cause hyperalgesia (heightened responses to noxious stimuli) <lb/>and allodynia (painful responses to non-noxious stimuli). A common consequence of increased <lb/>skin inflammation is the triggering of itch. <lb/>Acute and chronic itch are significant morbidities in humans. Itch-causing pathological <lb/>conditions have a variety of causes, including skin disorders (atopic dermatitis), drug-induced <lb/>reactions, systemic disorders such as liver disease, and other neurological disorders (Dong and <lb/>Dong, 2018). The sensation of itch is distinct from pain and is carried by a subset of itch-specific <lb/>somatosensory neurons called pruriceptive neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia <lb/>(DRG). Skin itch is triggered by release of pro-inflammatory compounds such as cytokines (IL-4, <lb/>IL-13, and IL-31), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and histamine from mast cells and <lb/>epithelial cells, which act upon membrane receptors and channels present in epidermal nerve <lb/>endings (Oetjen et al., 2017; Solinski et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2013). In addition to chemical <lb/>itch, mechanical stimuli can evoke similar itch sensations but rely on a distinct spinal circuit <lb/>(Acton et al., 2019; Bourane et al., 2015; Pagani et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2019). <lb/>Somatosensory neurons have been classically categorized using soma size, electrical <lb/>properties (including myelination state), and expression of a few markers that include lectins <lb/>(IB4), neuroactive peptides, and ion channels. Recently, multiple groups have described the <lb/>diversity of somatosensory neurons from the adult DRG using single-cell RNA sequencing, a <lb/>powerful approach that has allowed an improved classification of subtypes of sensory neurons <lb/>and their abilities to respond to agonists (Li et al., 2016a; Usoskin et al., 2015). These studies <lb/>have classified DRG neurons into six to eight defined groups based solely on expression of <lb/>unique transduction or signaling molecules. In addition, by genetically labeling and sorting DRG <lb/></body>

			<body>populations prior to RNAseq, the ion channels conferring unique electrical properties have been <lb/>mapped to eight distinct populations (Zheng et al., 2019). <lb/>One population of DRG neurons identified in these single cell RNAseq studies is <lb/>uniquely identified by expression of the peptides Nppb (natriuretic peptide B, also called brain <lb/>natriuretic peptide, or BNP) and Somatostatin (Sst), as well as IL-31 receptor type a (Il31ra) (Li <lb/>et al., 2016a; Usoskin et al., 2015). These cells, representing 6-8% of all neurons in the DRG, <lb/>are purely pruriceptive, transmitting itch, but not pain, signals to the dorsal horn of the spinal <lb/>cord.(Huang et al., 2018) These neurons develop from an initially Runx1 + , TrkA + population that <lb/>ultimately loses TrkA expression but gains peptidergic markers such as Calcitonin gene related <lb/>peptide (CGRP) (Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012). How this subset is specified remains a mystery. <lb/>TMEM184B is a relatively uncharacterized 7-pass transmembrane protein that is a <lb/>member of the Transporter-Opsin-GPCR (TOG) superfamily of proteins (Yee et al., 2013). <lb/>TMEM184B is required for efficient axon degeneration following nerve injury, and also for proper <lb/>sensory and motor nerve terminal maintenance (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). In mice lacking <lb/>Tmem184b, nociceptive terminals in the epidermis show swollen endings, and mice show <lb/>deficits in broad measures of sensorimotor behavior (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). Here we show <lb/>that TMEM184B controls the expression of a large cohort of sensory receptors in the DRG, <lb/>specifically those in the NP3/C2 population mediating pruriception. We found specific behavioral <lb/>defects in acute itch, but not pain, when Tmem184b is absent, showing that TMEM184B is <lb/>required for proper pruriception. Tmem184b loss causes a reduction in the total number of <lb/>NP3/C2 neurons in adults. TMEM184B is also required for expression of critical drivers of <lb/>sensory neurogenesis in embryos, suggesting an early role for TMEM184B in sensory <lb/>development. Rescue experiments in both adults and embryos support a primary role for <lb/>TMEM184B in pruriceptive neuron specification through control of Wnt signaling. Our data <lb/>identify a critical role for TMEM184B in the establishment of the neurons responsible for primary <lb/>pruriception. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>TMEM184B Controls the Expression of Pruriceptive Markers <lb/>In studying the nervous system phenotypes of loss of the transmembrane protein, <lb/>TMEM184B, which include axon protection as well as dysmorphic nerve terminals <lb/>(Bhattacharya et al., 2016), we sought to identify expression changes that could contribute to <lb/>these phenotypes. We performed RNA sequencing on isolated adult DRGs of 6-month-old <lb/>Tmem184b global knockout mice and compared sequences to age-matched wild-type mice. We <lb/>observed 316 genes with significantly downregulated (FDR ≤ 0.05) transcript expression in <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant ganglia, and 90 genes that had significantly upregulated transcripts (Figure <lb/>1A-B). Strikingly, the downregulated genes contained a large fraction of markers previously <lb/>identified in single-cell RNAseq studies as being unique to a population of pruriceptive neurons <lb/>(called C2 or NP3 in previous studies) (Chiu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016b). The key markers of <lb/>NP3/C2 neurons are dramatically downregulated, with Il31ra, Nppb, and Sst being among the <lb/>largest changes seen in the dataset (Figure 1B). However, other types of neurons also showed <lb/>decreased expression of their unique markers, including NP2/C4 (identified by Mrgpra3) and <lb/>NP1/C5-6 (identified by Mrgprd) (Figure 1C). Taken together, this data identifies TMEM184B as <lb/>a major regulator of somatosensory gene expression, particularly in pruriceptive populations. <lb/>To predict the functional significance of these expression changes, we performed <lb/>pathway analysis (see methods for details). Downregulated transcripts were enriched in <lb/>pathways such as GPCR signaling, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, and <lb/>synaptic transmission (Figure 1D). When human phenotype ontology was examined, pruritus <lb/>was the top and most significantly changed feature (p &lt; 0.003). These data show that <lb/>TMEM184B is required for appropriate transcription of signaling pathways critical to normal <lb/>sensory function. <lb/>TMEM184B is required for itch, but not pain, responses <lb/></body>

			<body>To test the behavioral consequences of the expression changes observed in <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant mice, we challenged them with agonists that promote itch or pain. The <lb/>cytokine IL-31, implicated in atopic dermatitis, activates the IL31RA/OSMR heterodimeric <lb/>receptor on NP3/C2 DRG neurons, whereas the anti-malarial agent chloroquine (CQ) activates <lb/>MRGPRA3 on NP2/C4 DRG neurons (Cevikbas et al., 2014; Dillon et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2009). <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant mice are resistant to scratching evoked by IL-31 injection (Figure 2A). In <lb/>addition, mutant mice have a reduced response to chloroquine, although the reduction does not <lb/>reach statistical significance (Figure 2B, p = 0.07). To examine the effects on other nociceptive <lb/>populations, we performed mechanical threshold and thermal pain testing. Tmem184b-mutant <lb/>mice responded normally to these stimuli (Figure 2C-E). Taken together, this data shows that <lb/>TMEM184B is selectively required for behavioral responses to pruriceptive agonists. <lb/>TMEM184B is required for proper NP3/C2 development <lb/>One possible explanation for the reduction in NP3/C2-associated transcripts is that <lb/>NP3/C2 neurons failed to develop. Because NP3/C2 DRG neurons are uniquely marked by Sst <lb/>expression, we used a genetic strategy to label these markers using Sst Cre combined with Cre-<lb/>dependent tdTomato expression. We find that the percent of adult neurons labeled with <lb/>tdTomato is reduced but not completely eliminated in Tmem184b-mutant mice (Figure 3A-B). <lb/>Thus, some loss of these neurons may contribute to the reduction of gene expression seen in <lb/>RNAseq experiments. <lb/>One possibility we considered is that the Sst promoter may have briefly turned on during <lb/>earlier time points, and then failed to be maintained in adults (Sst transcript levels are 27% of <lb/>wild-type in adult DRGs). To interrogate whether somatosensory neuron developmental <lb/>specification had been altered, we used RNA sequencing to examine the onset of pruriceptive <lb/>neuron markers at different developmental stages: embryonic day 13.5, postnatal day 0, and <lb/>postnatal day 10. At the latest time point, expression of NP3/C2 DRG markers has been <lb/>previously observed (Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012). We found expression of Tmem184b by <lb/></body>

			<body>E13.5 (Figure 3C) and continuing throughout DRG differentiation; this is also supported by a <lb/>recently published single-cell RNAseq timecourse analysis showing Tmem184b expression in <lb/>sensory neuron progenitors as early as E11.5 (Sharma et al., 2020). Sst expression in wild-type <lb/>began at P0 and was maintained at high levels through P10, when NP3/C2 neurons express the <lb/>majority of their unique markers (Figure 3D). In Tmem184b-mutant mice, Sst failed to turn on at <lb/>P0 but had a burst of expression at P10. This burst of Sst activity in mutants at P10 likely <lb/>causes tdTomato expression, as these neurons would be permanently marked following the <lb/>burst even if they express little Sst as adults. In comparison, Il31ra expression is suppressed <lb/>throughout these developmental timepoints (Figure 3E), while Nppb expression is unaffected <lb/>prior to adulthood (Figure 3F). This data argues for a functional loss of C2 neurons in <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant mice. Supporting this interpretation, we see significant reductions at E13.5 <lb/>in neurogenin 1 (Neurog1), neurogenin 2 (Neurog2), and POU domain, class 4, transcription <lb/>factor 1, (Pou4f1, also known as Brn3a) (Figure 3G-I). These transcription factors are critical in <lb/>establishing neuronal numbers and identity in migrating neural crest progenitors (Lallemend and <lb/>Ernfors, 2012; Lee et al., 2004; Raisa Eng et al., 2001). Many other genes necessary for <lb/>somatosensory development or mature function are also dysregulated (Figure S1). Taken <lb/>together, our data supports a model in which TMEM184B, acting early in neuronal development, <lb/>controls a developmental program leading to the proper specification of pruriceptive neurons. <lb/>Aberrant cellular responses to nociceptive and pruriceptive agonists in Tmem184b-<lb/>mutant mice <lb/>To determine whether functional shifts in adult somatosensory neuron populations had <lb/>occurred, we performed calcium imaging on dissociated adult DRG neurons. We saw significant <lb/>reductions in the percentage of neurons that responded to the broad nociceptive receptor <lb/>agonists, capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, a TRPA1 agonist) (Figure <lb/>4A-B). The percent of neurons responding to two agonists specific for the NP3/C2 population, <lb/>CYM5442 (an S1PR1 agonist) and LY344862 (an HTR1F agonist) was reduced (Figure 4D-E). <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>These results support our genetic labeling data and suggest that cell loss contributes to our <lb/>pruriceptive phenotypes. Paradoxically, mutant mice showed an increased percentage of <lb/>neurons responding to both IL-31 and chloroquine (Figure 4F-G). Because in wild type mice, <lb/>S1pr1, Htr1f, and Il31ra are all unique markers of NP3/C2 neurons, we interpret these dynamic <lb/>changes as evidence that gene expression has been at least partially uncoupled with cell fate in <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant ganglia. To rectify the increase in the percentage of IL-31 responsive <lb/>neurons with the loss of behavioral responses, we evaluated the amplitude of IL-31-induced <lb/>calcium increases in individual neurons. Among neurons classified as responders, IL-31 <lb/>triggered substantially weaker responses in mutant neurons when compared to wild type (Figure <lb/>4H). The reduction in responses of individual neurons to IL-31 likely contributes to the loss of IL-<lb/>31-induced pruriception in adults. <lb/>In vivo re-expression of Tmem184b in adult mutant ganglia does not increase IL-31 <lb/>responses <lb/>Given our results showing reductions in the NP3/C2 population, we sought to evaluate <lb/>whether TMEM184B contributes solely to early neuronal specification or if it can influence <lb/>pruriceptive function in adulthood. If TMEM184B&apos;s role is primarily developmental, then re-<lb/>expression in adults should not rescue IL-31 responsiveness. We constructed an adeno-<lb/>associated (AAV9) virus encoding Tmem184b under the control of the neuronal-specific <lb/>Synapsin promoter, and injected this virus, or control AAV9 expressing only mCherry, into the <lb/>cervical intrathecal space (Figure 5A). Histological analysis showed that virus was able to <lb/>spread to DRG from C1-C10 (Figure 5B) and also into some of the central axonal projections of <lb/>these DRGs into the dorsal horn (Figure 5C). Virus expression was also seen in the dorsal gray <lb/>matter (Figure 5C). In these mice, we evaluated scratching responses to subsequent IL-31 <lb/>injection. All IL-31-injected mutant mice showed some scratching responses compared to saline <lb/>controls, suggesting that AAV injection and expression influenced the baseline levels of IL-31 <lb/>responsiveness (Figure 5D). Surprisingly, we found that in wild-type mice, overexpression of <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>Tmem184b attenuates scratching to IL-31 injection. However, we were unable to alter mutant <lb/>responsiveness with adult re-expression of Tmem184b. The failure to rescue in adults is <lb/>consistent with a primary effect of TMEM184B activity during development of pruriceptive <lb/>neurons. <lb/>TMEM184B controls expression of Wnt signaling components in embryonic DRG <lb/>neurons <lb/>Given our data indicating a reduction in pruriceptive neurons and significant decreases <lb/>in the expression of critical transcription factors required for sensory differentiation, we sought to <lb/>determine the molecular mechanism responsible for these effects. We cultured E13.5 <lb/>embryonic DRG neurons from wild type or mutant mice for 14 days (DIV 14, roughly equivalent <lb/>timewise to postnatal day 8) (Figure 6A). In a subset of neurons from each mutant embryo, we <lb/>re-expressed Tmem184b using lentiviral transduction on the day of dissociation. At day 14, we <lb/>collected RNA and performed RNA sequencing for each condition. We identified differentially <lb/>expressed genes in DIV 14 mutant neurons relative to wild type (Figure 6B), and in mutant <lb/>neurons with and without restoration of Tmem184b (Figure 6C). Within these genes, we <lb/>identified those that both decreased in the absence of Tmem184b and were increased in <lb/>mutants upon re-expression of Tmem184b. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 304 <lb/>genes matching this pattern. Gene ontology analysis revealed biological processes significantly <lb/>over-represented by these genes, representing processes positively regulated by TMEM184B <lb/>activity. Genes negatively regulated by TMEM184B were also identified and analyzed, though <lb/>there were fewer in this group (Figure S2). The most over-represented process among genes <lb/>positively regulated by TMEM184B is the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (23.5-fold <lb/>enriched), a non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Canonical Wnt signaling was also enriched <lb/>(7.93-fold). Both groups contain multiple Wnt receptors including Frizzled-1, Frizzled-2, and <lb/>Frizzled-10. Many of the processes controlled by TMEM184B influence important neuronal <lb/>functions including calcium regulation (7.86-fold enrichment) and axon guidance (4.18-fold <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>enrichment). This data implicates TMEM184B in controlling key developmental steps in the <lb/>establishment of the somatosensory system. Wnt signaling is known to control the early <lb/>expression of Neurogenins and Brn3a during sensory neuron differentiation (Kondo et al., <lb/>2011). Our data therefore support a model in which TMEM184B controls the proper expression <lb/>of Wnt signaling components necessary for the cascade of developmental events leading to <lb/>pruriceptive neuron differentiation. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our data support a significant role for TMEM184B in the control of pruriception. <lb/>Tmem184b-mutant DRGs show reduction of pruriceptor transcripts in the NP3/C2 population. Of <lb/>note, mRNA expression of the IL-31 receptor subunit, Il31ra, and its co-receptor, Osmr, are both <lb/>strongly decreased in the absence of Tmem184b. We see reduced IL-31-induced scratching as <lb/>well as lower response magnitudes in individual neurons in response to IL-31 application in <lb/>mutant mice. IL-31-mediated itch is central to the development of atopic dermatitis, and thus the <lb/>expression and function of its receptor is of significant medical interest (Dillon et al., 2004). Our <lb/>data identify a novel mechanism promoting the expression of the IL-31 receptor on sensory <lb/>neurons and ultimately controlling IL-31 induced behaviors. <lb/>Using a genetic labeling strategy, we found that NP3/C2 neuron numbers are reduced in <lb/>the absence of Tmem184b, though they are not completely eliminated. Using calcium imaging, <lb/>we found a reduction of nociceptive neurons generally and skewed numbers and/or sensitivity of <lb/>remaining pruriceptive populations. In addition, at E13, we see reductions in transcripts <lb/>encoding critical developmental factors including Neurog1, Neurog2, and Pou4f1. These three <lb/>factors are essential for the establishment and differentiation of neurons within sensory ganglia <lb/>(Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012). Based on this evidence, we believe that TMEM184B acts early <lb/>in sensory development to promote the proper specification of nociceptive and pruriceptive <lb/>neurons. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Our Tmem184b-mutant phenotypes are consistent with an effect on sensory neuron <lb/>differentiation. How TMEM184B activity directly controls these developmental programs is still <lb/>mysterious. Data from embryonic neurons indicate that Tmem184b positively regulates <lb/>components of Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is critical for early neural crest development, and in <lb/>stem cells, Wnt signaling induces Neurog1 and Pou4f1 expression (Garcia-Morales et al., 2009; <lb/>Kondo et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2004). One way this might occur is through Wnt activation of <lb/>transcription via the homeodomain transcription factor, Tlx3. Supporting this idea, Tlx3 <lb/>nociceptor-specific knockouts show loss of pruriceptive populations as well as reductions in the <lb/>same pruriceptive markers as in Tmem184b-mutant DRGs (Huang et al., 2017; Lopes et al., <lb/>2012). Intriguingly, the effect of blockade of Wnt secretion on the morphology of the mouse <lb/>neuromuscular junction is strikingly similar to that seen in Tmem184b-mutant mice, further <lb/>implicating a link between TMEM184B and Wnt signaling (Bhattacharya et al., 2016; Shen et al., <lb/>2018). Future experiments should test how TMEM184B activity and appropriate Wnt signaling in <lb/>early sensory development are associated. <lb/>It is possible that TMEM184B plays an additional role in adult nociceptor maintenance. <lb/>First, in wild type mice, over-expression of Tmem184b causes reduction in IL-31-induced <lb/>scratching (Figure 5D). One possible explanation is that TMEM184B may be promoting <lb/>apoptosis. In support of this model, we see decreased expression of apoptotic pathway <lb/>components when Tmem184b is absent and restoration of these components upon Tmem184b <lb/>re-expression in cultured DRGs (data not shown). Future experiments deleting Tmem184b <lb/>solely in adults would be necessary to clarify roles for TMEM184B in long-term maintenance of <lb/>pruriceptors. <lb/>In summary, we show that TMEM184B activity critically affects the development of <lb/>pruriceptive neurons in mouse DRG and that this effect is likely due to its ability to induce <lb/>components of Wnt signaling during neurogenesis. Our data illuminates a new key regulatory <lb/>step in the processes controlling the establishment of diversity in the somatosensory system. <lb/></body>

			<body>Online Methods <lb/>Animal Models <lb/>All animal treatment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the <lb/>University of Arizona (protocol # 17-216). Tmem184b gene-trap mice have been described <lb/>previously (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). Mice were bred to Sst Cre and Rosa-Flox-stop-Flox-<lb/>tdTomato (also called Ai9) (lines 013044 and 007909, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) for <lb/>histological quantification of the C2 population. Only heterozygous Sst Cre mice were used for <lb/>experiments due to the possible disruption of normal somatostatin expression in homozygous <lb/>Cre mice. <lb/>RNA sequencing <lb/>Total RNA was isolated from adult DRG from 6-month old mutant and wild-type mice (4 per <lb/>genotype, mixed male and female groups) using the RNaqueous Micro kit (Ambion). All DRGs <lb/>were pooled for each sample to obtain enough RNA for analysis. Following total RNA <lb/>extraction, samples were ethanol precipitated to increase purity. Library preparation and <lb/>sequencing was performed at the Washington University Genome Technology Access Center <lb/>(GTAC). Data were analyzed using Salmon and DeSeq2 (on our servers or with Galaxy, <lb/>www.usegalaxy.org). Volcano plots were generated in RStudio; heatmaps of genes for which <lb/>adjusted P values were less than 0.05 were created using Cluster 3.0 and Java Treeview. To <lb/>create heatmaps of normalized counts, hierarchical clustering was used in Cluster3.0 to arrange <lb/>genes by expression similarity. For embryonic DRG analysis, total RNA was isolated using <lb/>TRIzol and library preparation and sequencing was performed by Novogene; identical analysis <lb/>methods were used. For bioinformatics analysis, we used Panther&apos;s over-representation <lb/>analysis of biological processes (complete) (http://www.pantherdb.org/) as well as Enrichr <lb/>(www.enrichr.com).

Significance calculated by Fisher&apos;s exact test with a BHM FDR ≤ 0.05. <lb/>Cytokine Injections and Behavior Analysis <lb/>Mice were at least 8 weeks old at the time of injection. For itch experiments, both males and <lb/>females of approximately equal quantities were used and data were pooled. Littermate controls <lb/>were used, and videos were captured early in the morning to minimize mice falling asleep <lb/>during videotaping. Mice were acclimated to behavioral chambers (red Rat Retreats, Bioserv) <lb/>for one hour, removed from the chamber briefly for injections of either IL-31 (Peprotech, 3 nmol <lb/>in 10 microliters of PBS for cheek injections or 300 µM for nape injections, depending on <lb/>experiment), chloroquine (concentration), or 0.9% saline alone, and returned to the chamber, at <lb/>which time videotaping began. Analysis was done blinded to genotype and injected substance. <lb/>Scratching bouts were tallied for 30 minutes post-injection. Tail flick, hot plate, and Von Frey <lb/>testing methods have been previously described. (Bannon and Malmberg, 2007; Chaplan et al., <lb/>1994; Hargreaves et al., 1988) For pain and mechanical threshold testing, the experimenter <lb/>was blinded to genotype, and males and females were separated during analysis. <lb/>AAV Injection <lb/>Custom AAV9 was built and titered by Vector Biolabs. Viruses were intrathecally injected (10ul, <lb/>2.0 x 10^6 virus particles/mL) at 8 to 9 weeks of age. Each mouse received intradermal (i.d.) <lb/>saline injections 3 weeks after AAV delivery, and one week later received i.d. IL-31 injections. <lb/>One Tmem184b mutant mouse with ~10x average scratching behavior to both saline and IL-31 <lb/>was treated as an outlier and removed from our analysis. <lb/>DRG Immunohistochemistry and Image Analysis <lb/>Isolated ganglia or spinal cords were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour, immersed in <lb/>30% sucrose overnight (4°C), and embedded in OCT cryo-compound (Tissue-Tek® O.C.T.) <lb/>using isopentane cooled with dry ice. Spinal cords were dissected into segments containing two <lb/></body>

Following washes in <lb/>PBST and 1 hour of blocking in 5% goat serum in PBST, sections were incubated overnight at <lb/>4°C with rabbit NeuN (1:250, Proteintech), or for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor® 488 Mouse anti-β-<lb/>Tubulin, Class III (BD Pharmingen). Secondary antibody for NeuN was goat anti-rabbit Alexa <lb/>Fluor 633 (Thermo Fisher). Sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Biolabs). Spinal <lb/>cords were imaged with a ZEISS AxioZoom V16 Fluorescent Microscope. DRGs were imaged <lb/>using a ZEISS Axio Observer Z1 or LSM880 inverted confocal microscope. For DRG counting, <lb/>only neurons with a visible NeuN-positive nucleus in the section were counted. For each <lb/>genotype, n = 5 mice. For each mouse, ≥800 neurons were counted. <lb/>Neuronal Culture <lb/>For adult neurons, ganglia from all spinal levels were pooled in DMEM on ice, followed by <lb/>digestion with Liberase TM (Roche) and 0.05% Trypsin (Gibco).
