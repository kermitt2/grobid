Overall, these studies demonstrate that wild-type p53 represses MELK expression by inhibiting E2F1A-<lb/>dependent transcription of FOXM1 and that mutation-driven loss of wild-type p53, which frequently occurs in TNBCs, induces MELK <lb/>expression by suppressing FOXM1 expression and activity in p53-mutant breast cancers. <lb/>npj Breast Cancer (2020) 6:2 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41523-019-0143-5 <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a breast cancer subtype, <lb/>are highly aggressive tumors occurring frequently in young <lb/>women and in African American women who have a very poor <lb/>prognosis. TNBCs are defined as breast cancers lacking the <lb/>expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and <lb/>epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In our previous studies, <lb/>we identified several kinases overexpressed in TNBCs as compared <lb/>with ER-positive breast cancers and showed that inhibition of the <lb/>expression of several of these kinases suppressed the growth of <lb/>TNBC cells. 1 One such critical kinase is the maternal embryonic <lb/>leucine zipper kinase (MELK). 1 Several reports have identified that <lb/>MELK expression is highly elevated in many human cancers and <lb/>high MELK expression is associated with poor prognosis. 2-7 <lb/>MELK is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AMPK family <lb/>of kinases known to regulate cellular metabolism. 8 MELK was <lb/>initially discovered as one of the three mRNAs uniquely expressed <lb/>during early embryonic development. 9,10 MELK is also one of the <lb/>proliferation markers included in Food and Drug Administration-<lb/>approved breast cancer prognostic panels, such as Mamma-<lb/>Print 11,12 and PAM50, 13 which are used to plan treatment for breast <lb/>cancer patients and to predict cancer recurrence. High expression <lb/>of MELK is required for maintenance of mammary tumor-initiating <lb/>cells 14 and glioma stem cells. 15,16 In addition, MELK has been <lb/>reported to control several biological processes including cell <lb/>proliferation and cell cycle, invasion, apoptosis, splicing, and <lb/>resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 17-28 In contrast, <lb/>MELK expression is not required for normal development, as <lb/>knockout mice have no developmental defects. 24 However, two <lb/>recent studies showed that knockout of MELK, using CRISPR-cas9 <lb/>system, did not reduce the growth of TNBC cells. 29,30 Further <lb/>studies by Wang et al. 31,32 addressed the discrepancy of MELK role <lb/>on cancer cell growth, which revealed that MELK expression is <lb/>required for clonogenic growth of TNBC cells when cells were <lb/>cultured at low density, whereas MELK is not required for <lb/>clonogenic growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells that have <lb/>low MELK expression. In this study, we sought to determine the <lb/>molecular mechanism by which MELK is upregulated in TNBC <lb/>breast cancers. We discovered that MELK expression is associated <lb/>with p53 mutation status. The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a <lb/>transcription factor that controls both activation and repression of <lb/>gene expression in eukaryotic cells. 33,34 Wild-type p53 (WT p53) <lb/>regulates the expression of many genes by inducing or repressing <lb/>transcription, whereas loss or mutation of p53 promotes tumor-<lb/>igenesis. 33-35 Inactivation of WT p53 is a common event during <lb/>cancer development and nearly half of all human cancers, and over <lb/>80% of TNBC patients, harbor mutations in the p53 gene, resulting <lb/>in loss of WT p53 activity. 36 <lb/></body>

			<body>Through these studies, we elucidated the molecular mechanism <lb/>by which MELK is highly expressed in TNBCs. We discovered that <lb/>high expression of MELK in p53-mutant breast cancers is due to <lb/>the loss of WT p53 activity, which normally functions in p53 <lb/>WT cells by repressing E2F1A binding to the FOXM1 promoter, <lb/>which reduces FOXM1 expression and, in turn, MELK expression. <lb/>We also discovered that in p53-mutant TNBCs, E2F1A is recruited <lb/>to FOXM1 promoter, causing increased expression of FOXM1, <lb/>which binds to the MELK promoter and activates MELK transcrip-<lb/>tion, thus increasing MELK expression in TNBCs. These studies <lb/>demonstrate that in p53-mutant breast cancers, E2F1A and <lb/>FOXM1 regulates the expression of MELK, a novel kinase <lb/>associated with poor prognosis and a potential novel target for <lb/>the treatment of these aggressive cancers. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>MELK expression is highly elevated in p53-mutant breast cancers <lb/>We previously identified protein kinases upregulated in human <lb/>ER-negative tumors as compared with ER-positive breast cancers. <lb/>One of these kinases, MELK, is highly expressed in TNBC tumors <lb/>compared with normal breast and non-TNBC breast cancers <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 1A, B), and the elevation of MELK expression <lb/>occurs in early-stage breast cancers (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D). To <lb/>investigate the mechanism by which MELK expression is highly <lb/>elevated in TNBCs, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) <lb/>and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Con-<lb/>sortium (METABRIC) breast cancer patient data sets (cBioPortal) to <lb/>determine whether upregulated MELK expression correlates with <lb/>gene copy number, promoter methylation, or any specific <lb/>oncogenic mutations. Our analysis revealed that elevated MELK <lb/>expression is significantly enriched in breast tumors with p53 <lb/>mutations in both TCGA Provisional and METABRIC 37 data sets <lb/>(Fig. 1a). Consistent with our finding, upregulation of MELK <lb/>expression in p53-mutant breast tumors compared with their <lb/>matched normal breast tissues is significantly higher than WT p53 <lb/>counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Nearly 80% of TNBC tumors <lb/>harbor mutations in the p53 gene, a tumor suppressor gene, which <lb/>is inactivated in over 50% of all human cancers. Furthermore, <lb/>analysis of two independent breast cancer patient data sets (Curtis <lb/>and Ivshina) 38,39 showed that MELK expression is elevated at mRNA <lb/>levels in p53-mutant breast cancer tumors (Fig. 1b) and the <lb/>elevation of MELK expression is independent of ER status <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 2B). Consistent with this observation, MELK <lb/>expression is significantly elevated in p53-mutant cancers of the <lb/>lung, bladder, brain, and prostate compared with their WT p53 <lb/>tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Similar to MELK mRNA expression, <lb/>MELK protein is elevated in p53-mutant breast cancer cell lines <lb/>compared with WT p53 cells (Fig. 1c, d). Minn et al. 40 showed that <lb/>MELK is one of the 54 genes associated with metastasis of primary <lb/>breast cancer cells to the lungs. To determine whether MELK <lb/>expression status correlates with metastasis-free survival rate, we <lb/>analyzed three independent breast cancer data sets (Schmidt, <lb/>Desmedt, and Esserman), 41-43 which demonstrated that high MELK <lb/>expression is significantly associated with poor metastasis-free <lb/>survival in all three data sets (Supplementary Fig. 1E). <lb/>Dominant-negative p53 mutants increase MELK expression by <lb/>inhibiting WT p53 <lb/>Previous reports have shown that gain-of-function p53 mutants <lb/>induce the expression of several critical genes involved cancer <lb/>initiation and progression. 35,44 We next tested whether p53 <lb/>mutants regulate MELK expression by depleting the expression <lb/>of mutant p53 in TNBC cells that have high MELK expression. <lb/>Depletion of mutant p53 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) did <lb/>not reduce the expression of MELK (Fig. 2a). To determine whether <lb/>mutant p53 induces the expression of MELK, we generated stable <lb/>cells to express p53 mutants (R175H, R249S, R273H, and R280K) in <lb/>p53-null cells (MDA MB 436 and SKOV3) and measured MELK <lb/>expression. In both SKOV3 and MDA MB 436 cells, overexpression <lb/>of p53 mutants did not induce MELK expression (Fig. 2b). <lb/>However, overexpression of these p53 mutants in WT p53 cells <lb/>(MCF7 and ZR-75 cells) induced MELK expression (Fig. 2c). These <lb/>mutants appear to act as dominant-negative proteins, which <lb/>inhibit the WT activity of p53. These data suggest that inhibition of <lb/>WT p53 is the key mechanism to elevate MELK expression. <lb/>Inactivation of WT p53 increases MELK expression <lb/>We next tested whether elevated expression of MELK is due to the <lb/>loss of WT activity of p53. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited WT <lb/>p53 by using siRNA in WT p53-containing cells. As shown in Fig. <lb/>2d, we depleted WT p53 in two normal breast epithelial cell lines <lb/>and two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines that have WT p53. <lb/>Knockdown of WT p53 significantly increased MELK protein <lb/>expression. Similarly, knockdown of p53 increased MELK mRNA <lb/>expression in WT p53 cells (Fig. 2e) but not in mutant p53 cells <lb/>(Fig. 2f). These results suggest that loss of WT activity of p53 is the <lb/>key mechanism for elevated MELK expression in TNBC cells. Based <lb/>on this data, we hypothesized that WT p53 acts as a transcriptional <lb/>repressor of MELK. To test this hypothesis, we generated stable <lb/>MDA MB 436 and SKOV3 cells with inducible expression of WT p53 <lb/>using a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible system (pInducer20-p53 WT). <lb/>SKOV3 and MDA MB 436 are p53-null cell lines and express high <lb/>levels of MELK. As shown in Fig. 3a-d, induction of WT p53 by Dox <lb/>treatment significantly reduced MELK protein levels in both cell <lb/>lines, while increasing p21 protein levels (a downstream marker of <lb/>WT p53). In addition, Dox treatment did not reduce MELK protein <lb/>levels in MDA MB 436 cells expressing empty vector, suggesting <lb/>that Dox reduces MELK expression by inducing WT p53 <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 3A). Furthermore, inhibition of the <lb/>proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway did not <lb/>affect the repressive effects of WT p53 on MELK protein levels <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 3B). In addition, induction of WT p53 by <lb/>doxorubicin in MCF7 and Cal51 (WT p53 cells) repressed MELK <lb/>protein levels in a dose-dependent manner Fig. 3e. In addition to <lb/>transcriptional activation, WT p53 represses gene transcription. We <lb/>analyzed breast cancer data sets (Curtis and TCGA) to determine <lb/>whether MELK expression correlates with WT p53-induced or <lb/>repressed genes. 45 Analysis of breast cancer data sets revealed <lb/>that MELK expression is significantly correlated with p53-<lb/>repressed genes (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3C) but not with <lb/>p53-induced genes (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Collectively, these <lb/>results suggest that WT p53 acts as a negative regulator of MELK <lb/>expression, and that loss of WT p53 activity elevates MELK <lb/>expression in TNBC cells. <lb/>WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity <lb/>To test whether WT p53 controls MELK expression by regulating <lb/>the activity of the MELK promoter, we cloned a −5 kb promoter <lb/>region of MELK (isolated from human mammary epithelial cells, <lb/>HMECs) upstream to the transcription start site. Analysis of MELK <lb/>promoter (using the TransFac software tool) revealed that the <lb/>−5 kb region of MELK promoter region contains four potential p53 <lb/>response elements (RE1 through RE4), as shown in Fig. 4a. First, we <lb/>measured the activity of MELK promoter in p53-deficient cells to <lb/>test whether p53 status controls MELK promoter activity. For this, <lb/>we transfected the −5 kb MELK promoter into MCF7 cells that <lb/>stably expressed p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown WT <lb/>p53 or a control shRNA (shScramble). As shown in the Fig. 4b, <lb/>depletion of WT p53 in MCF7 cells significantly increased MELK <lb/>promoter activity, suggesting that loss of WT p53 elevates MELK <lb/>expression. Consistent with this observation, induction of WT p53, <lb/>using a Dox-inducible system to induce WT p53, suppressed MELK <lb/>promoter activity in both MDA MB 436 (Fig. 4c) and SKOV3 <lb/></body>

			<body>(Fig. 4d) cells. These results show that WT p53 represses MELK <lb/>expression by controlling MELK promoter activity, whereas loss of <lb/>WT p53 elevates MELK expression. Similarly, inhibition of WT p53 <lb/>by overexpression of dominant-negative p53 mutants in MCF7 <lb/>cells (WT p53 cells) also significantly increased MELK promoter <lb/>activity (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B), suggesting that dominant-<lb/>negative forms of p53 mutants induce MELK expression by <lb/>inhibiting the repressive effects of WT p53. <lb/>Deletion of putative p53 response elements does not affect <lb/>repressive effect of WT p53 on MELK promoter activity <lb/>To determine whether any of the four p53 response elements <lb/>(RE1, RE2, RE3, and RE4) is critical for WT p53-mediated inhibition <lb/>of MELK promoter (as shown in Fig. 4e), we sequentially deleted <lb/>these elements and transfected these MELK promoter constructs <lb/>into p53-null cells (MDA MB 436 and SKOV3) that had been stably <lb/>transfected with a Dox-inducible WT p53 construct. We then <lb/>measured promoter luciferase activity in the presence and <lb/>absence of WT p53 (achieved by culturing with or without Dox). <lb/>Induction of WT p53 repressed the −5 kb MELK promoter activity, <lb/>as well as the activity of all truncated MELK promoter constructs to <lb/>levels comparable to the −5 kb MELK promoter in both MDA MB <lb/>436 (Fig. 4f) and SKOV3 (Supplementary Fig. 4C) cells. We also <lb/>measured the activity of these constructs in MCF7 cells with both <lb/>intact WT p53 and deficient p53. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <lb/>4D, the activity of all of these constructs was very low in intact WT <lb/>p53 cells (shControl), whereas depletion of WT p53 by <lb/>shP53 significantly elevated the luciferase activity of all constructs. <lb/>Similarly, inhibition of WT p53 by overexpressing the dominant-<lb/>negative p53 mutant (R175H) enhanced the activity of MELK <lb/>promoters in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4E). To further <lb/>investigate whether WT p53 is recruited to any of these putative <lb/>response elements on MELK promoter, we performed chromatin <lb/>immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to determine whether <lb/>WT p53 is recruited to the MELK promoter. As shown in <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 4F, WT p53 is not recruited to any of the <lb/>response elements on the MELK promoter. However, WT p53 is <lb/>recruited to the p21 promoter (used as a positive control). We <lb/>analyzed several p53-ChIP-seq data sets to identify WT p53-<lb/>binding sites on MELK promoter. In one of these data sets, WT p53 <lb/>is reported to be recruited to MELK at the exon1/intron1 region. 46 <lb/>Fig. 1 Correlation between MELK expression and p53 mutation status. a Analysis of breast cancer data sets (TCGA and METABRIC) to <lb/>determine the co-occurrence of high MELK expression with oncogenic mutations in breast cancer patients.

			<body>Contrary to this observation, we found that WT p53 is not <lb/>recruited to this site (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Overall, our results <lb/>suggest that WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity but does <lb/>not bind to any of the putative p53 response elements. <lb/>Next, to identify the region of MELK promoter that is required <lb/>for WT p53-dependent suppression of MELK expression, we made <lb/>additional deletions in the MELK promoter and determined <lb/>whether any of these deletions block the repressive effect of WT <lb/>p53 on MELK promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 4g, h and <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 5B, and using the same Dox-inducible system <lb/>to induce WT p53 in p53-null cells (MDA 436 cells and SKOV3), <lb/>deletion of the region between − 1.69 kb and − 0.69 kb sig-<lb/>nificantly reduced p53-dependent suppression of MELK promoter <lb/>activity. <lb/>WT p53 represses MELK expression by repressing FOXM1 <lb/>expression <lb/>As WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity without binding to its <lb/>response elements, we hypothesized that WT p53 controls MELK <lb/>expression by regulating some other transcription factor. We then <lb/>screened the MELK promoter using TransFac software to identify <lb/>potential transcription factors that can bind to MELK promoter <lb/>between − 1.69 and − 0.69 kb. Previously, Wang et al. 24 reported <lb/>that FOXM1, an upregulated transcription factor in many human <lb/>cancers, regulates MELK expression by directly binding to the <lb/>MELK promoter. Through our TransFac analysis, we identified a <lb/>novel site for FOXM1 at −686 bp, which is different from the site <lb/>identified by Wang et al. 24 (−512 bp). However, consistent with <lb/>results reported by Wang et al. 23 , knockdown of FOXM1 reduced <lb/>MELK expression in p53-mutant TNBC cells (Fig. 5a). Knockdown of <lb/>WT p53 increased FOXM1 expression (Fig. 5b), whereas induction <lb/>of WT p53 suppressed FOXM1 expression (Fig. 5c), suggesting that <lb/>WT p53 represses MELK expression by reducing FOXM1 levels. <lb/>Supporting this data, MELK expression levels correlate with <lb/>FOXM1 RNA expression levels, as well as with the FOXM1-<lb/>regulated gene, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), in TCGA breast cancer <lb/>dataset (Fig. 5d). <lb/>Previously, Millour et al. 47 showed that WT p53 represses <lb/>FOXM1 levels by reducing E2F1A levels at the FOXM1 promoter. <lb/>To test whether E2F1 plays a critical role in p53-dependent <lb/>repression of FOXM1 and MELK, we inhibited E2F1 expression in <lb/>p53 WT and p53-mutant breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5e, <lb/>knockdown of E2F1A reduced the expression of FOXM1 and MELK <lb/>in p53-mutant TNBC cells, whereas knockdown of E2F1A in p53 <lb/>WT breast cancer cells (MCF7) did not affect FOXM1 and MELK <lb/>protein levels. We then investigated whether WT p53 represses <lb/>E2F1A levels to repress FOXM1 and MELK expression.

			<body>MELK expression. Previous studies have shown that WT p53 can <lb/>repress gene expression by blocking the recruitment of transcrip-<lb/>tion factors. 48,49 Therefore, we hypothesized that WT p53 blocks <lb/>the recruitment of FOXM1 to the MELK promoter by directly <lb/>binding to FOXM1. As shown in the Fig. 6d, co-immunoprecitation <lb/>assay demonstrated that FOXM1 physically interacts with WT p53 <lb/>in MDA MB 436 cells (last lane in western blotting).

Ectopic <lb/>expression of WT p53 also blocked FOXM1 recruitment to the <lb/>AURKB promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5E), which functions as a <lb/>positive control for the FOXM1 ChIP assay.

			<body>the molecular basis for high MELK expression in p53-mutant <lb/>breast cancers, including TNBCs. <lb/>Our results are summarized in the model shown in Fig. 7, which <lb/>shows that in cells containing WT p53, WT p53 actively represses <lb/>MELK expression by inhibiting FOXM1 transcription and reducing <lb/>FOXM1 binding to the MELK promoter. However, in cells with <lb/>mutant p53: (1) E2F1A induces FOXM1 expression and (2) FOXM1 <lb/>binds to the FOXM1 sites in the MELK promoter, thereby <lb/>increasing MELK expression. <lb/>Previously, we identified MELK, a serine/threonine protein <lb/>kinase, as a highly expressed kinase in TNBC patients. Several <lb/>studies reported that high expression of MELK is required for <lb/>cancer cell growth, invasiveness, cell cycle progression, stemness, <lb/>radiation-, and chemo-resistance in cancer. 14,17-24,50-55 Similar to <lb/>gene knockdown studies, MELK inhibitors also reported to be very <lb/>effective in both in vitro and in vivo studies despite the fact that <lb/>these inhibitors have significant off-target effects. 7,56-64 Recently, <lb/>Touré et al. 65 discovered a novel MELK inhibitor using a virtual <lb/>screening high throughput approach. This compound has highest <lb/>selectivity for MELK among the MELK inhibitors published to date <lb/>and inhibited the growth of TNBC cells expressing high MELK but <lb/>not ER-positive cells that express MELK at low levels. 65 However, <lb/>recent studies utilizing gene knockout strategies reported contra-<lb/>dicting results that MELK expression is not required for the growth <lb/>of cancer cells including breast cancer cells, despite the fact that <lb/>MELK is highly expressed in these cells. 29,66 Similarly, another <lb/>study by Huang et al. 30 reported that the anti-growth effects of <lb/>small-molecule MELK inhibitors are due to nonspecific targets and <lb/>increasing the specificity of these inhibitors to MELK reduced their <lb/>anti-growth effects. However, studies by Wang et al. 31,32 revealed <lb/>that knockout of MELK inhibits growth in breast cancer cells under <lb/>low density culture conditions, whereas knockout of MELK did not <lb/>affect the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells in which MELK <lb/>expression is low. <lb/>Our studies demonstrate that high expression of MELK in TNBC <lb/>cells is due to the loss of WT p53 or mutation in the p53 gene, <lb/>which is a common phenomenon in 50% of human cancers. p53-<lb/>mutant cancers have poor outcomes and tend to metastasize <lb/>frequently, which prompted us to elucidate the role p53 on <lb/>regulation MELK expression in TNBC. The elevation of MELK <lb/>expression is also observed in multiple human cancers where p53 <lb/>is commonly mutated, suggesting that high expression of MELK in <lb/>p53-mutant tumors is not specific to breast cancer and is a <lb/>common <lb/>phenomenon <lb/>in <lb/>multiple <lb/>human <lb/>cancer <lb/>types. 3,14,15,18,24,55,67,68 Thus, our results in TNBCs may also be <lb/>relevant for other cancer types. <lb/>Our results demonstrated that FOXM1 is an important regulator <lb/>of MELK expression in TNBC cells. FOXM1 is a critical transcription <lb/>factor, upregulated in many human cancers, including breast <lb/>cancer. 69,70 Similar to MELK expression, FOXM1 is highly expressed <lb/>in p53-mutant cancers due to the loss of WT p53 function. Wang <lb/>et al. 24 demonstrated that FOXM1 knockdown reduced MELK, and <lb/>that FOXM1 binds to the −512 bp site in the MELK promoter. Our <lb/>studies confirmed the binding of FOXM1 to this site, but also <lb/>uncovered a novel FOXM1-binding site at -612bp in the MELK <lb/>promoter. It is not clear whether these two sites function <lb/>independently or together, stabilizing a multi-protein complex <lb/>to regulate MELK transcription. A previous study demonstrated <lb/>that knockout of FOXM1 significantly retards tumor growth and <lb/>colonization of p53-null lymphoma and sarcoma cells in the <lb/>lungs. 71 FOXM1 also has been shown to control the expression of <lb/>genes to promote cell proliferation, invasiveness, metabolism, and <lb/>drug resistance. 72-75 <lb/>Another study by Barsotti et al. 74 showed that FOXM1 <lb/>expression was also suppressed by WT p53 in breast cancer cells. <lb/>WT p53 represses FOXM1 expression by inhibiting the recruitment <lb/>of E2F1A 47 and our studies revealed that knockdown of E2F1A <lb/>reduces MELK expression by reducing FOXM1 levels in p53-<lb/>mutant breast cancer cells. E2F1A is a transcription factor that is <lb/>commonly deregulated in multiple human cancers including <lb/>breast cancer. High expression of E2F1A is associated with poor <lb/>prognosis and controls cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, differ-<lb/>entiation, and stress response in many cancer types. 76-79 Thus, the <lb/>results by us and by others demonstrate that the transcriptions <lb/>factors that control MELK expression, E2F1A, FOXM1, and p53, also <lb/>regulate key biologic functions of cancer cells. <lb/>In summary, we identified that MELK is highly expressed in p53-<lb/>mutant breast cancers as compared with p53 WT cancers and <lb/>elucidated the mechanism by which mutant p53 causes <lb/>upregulation of MELK in these p53-mutant breast cancer cells. <lb/>Through this study, we discovered that MELK expression is highly <lb/>upregulated in TNBCs due to the loss of WT p53 activity. We also <lb/>observed high MELK expression in many other human cancers, <lb/>where p53 is commonly mutated. Our results show that WT p53 <lb/>represses MELK expression by inhibiting expression and recruit-<lb/>ment of FOXM1 to the MELK promoter. Through these studies, we <lb/>identified a novel molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 de-<lb/>represses MELK expression in p53-mutant TNBC breast cancers, <lb/>and identified FOXM1 and MELK as possible targets for the <lb/>treatment of p53-mutant breast cancers. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Cell lines and reagents <lb/>In this study, we used a panel of cell lines as listed in Supplementary Table <lb/>1. All of these cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were grown in the <lb/>growth medium (listed in Supplementary Table 1).

			<body>Cloning of MELK promoter <lb/>For cloning of MELK promoter, we isolated genomic DNA using a DNA <lb/>extraction kit, (Qiagen, Cat# 69501) from primary HMECs and PCR amplified <lb/>various lengths of MELK promoter regions using the primer sets listed in <lb/>Supplementary Table 3. Gel-purified PCR products were then cloned into a <lb/>linearized PGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) using the Quick <lb/>fusion cloning kit (Biotool, Cat# B2261), according to the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>instructions. <lb/>Cloning of WT p53 into pInducer20 <lb/>Using Gateway method, we cloned WT p53 (pCR8 p53 WT) into pInducer20 <lb/>(Addgene) following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Briefly, 50-150 ng of <lb/>donor vector (pCR8 p53 WT) and 150 ng of pInducer20 plasmids were <lb/>mixed with LR Clonase II (Cat# 11791, Invitrogen) and incubated at 25°C <lb/>for 1 h and reaction was terminated by adding Proteinase K. The reaction <lb/>products were then used to transform DH5a bacteria and positive clones <lb/>were selected on ampicillin containing agar plates 80-84 . <lb/>Luciferase assay <lb/>For promoter luciferase assays, we co-transfected 200,000 cells of MDA MB <lb/>436 or 100,000 cells of MCF7 and SKOV3 with 300 ng of PGL2 MELK <lb/>promoter with 50 ng of PhRG Renilla vector (internal control) using <lb/>XTremeGene9 transfection reagent (Cat# XTG9-RO) purchased from Roche. <lb/>After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer and 20 μl of <lb/>clear lysate was used for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit <lb/>(Promega, Cat# E#1910), following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>Transfection and western blotting <lb/>To knock down p53, E2F1A, and FOXM1, siRNA transfections were <lb/>performed using DharmaFect1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Cat# T-<lb/>2001-03), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. To overexpress <lb/>FOXM1 protein, we transfected breast cells (2 × 10 5 cells) with FOXM1 <lb/>plasmid or empty vector in a six-well plate using XtremeGene9 transfection <lb/>reagent (Cat# XTG9-RO) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>Protein samples were prepared by lysing the cells in RIPA buffer (Sigma-<lb/>Aldrich, Cat# R0278) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phos-<lb/>phatase inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Lysed cell lysates were collected and <lb/>centrifuged at 14.000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4°C. Equal amount of proteins <lb/>were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western <lb/>blotting analysis for proteins of interest using antibodies at optimized <lb/>concentrations. The full list of antibodies used in this study is given in <lb/>Supplementary Table 4. All western blottings from the same experiment <lb/>were run in parallel and the full blots are available in Supplementary Fig. 6. <lb/>Generation of stable cells <lb/>Stable cells were generated to overexpress p53 (WT and p53 mutants) <lb/>using lentivirus particles containing p53 constructs. To produce lentivirus, <lb/>we transfected Lenti-HEK-293 cells with 2 μg of p53 construct, 1.5 μg of <lb/>viral protein R (VPR), and 0.5 μg of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus G <lb/>protein (VSVG), a common coat protein for lentiviral vector expression <lb/>systems using X-treme-Gene9 transfection reagent (Roche, Cat# XTG9-RO) <lb/>for 72 h. Viral particles were collected from the medium by collecting <lb/>supernatant after centrifuging the medium at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 min. One <lb/>milliliter of lentivirus medium and 10 μg of polybrene were added to infect <lb/>the cells of interest. After 48 h, G418 (to select WT p53) or blasticidin (to <lb/>select p53 mutants) were added to select and generate stable cells. Stable <lb/>cells were tested for expression of WT p53 and p53 mutants through <lb/>western blotting analysis of HA-tag for p53 WT or V5-tag for p53 mutants. <lb/>ChIP and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis <lb/>ChIP experiments were performed as described previously with minor <lb/>modifications. Briefly, for each ChIP, cells were isolated from two 150 cm 2 <lb/>plates. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and <lb/>incubated cells with 1% formalin in PBS for 10 min to crosslink proteins <lb/>and DNA. Crosslinking was stopped with an incubation with 0.125 M <lb/>glycine for 5 min. The cells were collected in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM <lb/>EDTA in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1) and sonicated to fragment genomic DNA into <lb/>200-500 bp pieces. For each ChIP, 600 μg protein lysate was used to <lb/>immunoprecipitate p53, E2F1A, or FOXM1. The pulled down DNA <lb/>fragments were extracted using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, <lb/>cat# 28104) and subjected to quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) using the iTaq SYBR <lb/>green assay (BioRad, Cat# 1725121). The primer sets used for these assays <lb/>are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The Q-PCR result was normalized to <lb/>input fragments and the recruitment of p53, E2F1A, or FOXM1 were <lb/>presented as a fold change of PCR amplification in p53 or FOXM1 ChIP <lb/>samples compared with that of IgG samples. <lb/>Analysis of MELK expression and patient survival in breast cancer <lb/>data sets <lb/>To determine the association of MELK expression with p53 mutation status, <lb/>we obtained MELK mRNA expression data from the Oncomine database. <lb/>mRNA expression data from Curtis et al., 38 Ivshina et al. 39 (breast cancer data <lb/>sets), Ding et al. 81 (lung cancer), Grasso et al. 82 (prostate cancer), Lindgren <lb/>et al. 83 (bladder cancer), and Neale et al. 84 (brain cancer) were used to <lb/>compare MELK mRNA levels between p53 WT and p53-mutant cancer patient <lb/>samples. For breast cancer data sets, we also separated patient samples based <lb/>on ER status and determined the association between MELK mRNA expression <lb/>and p53 mutation status. The Student&apos;s t-test was used to determine the <lb/>statistical significance of MELK expression between p53 WT and p53 mutant <lb/>samples. Three independent data sets (Desmedt, Hatzis, and Schimdt) from <lb/>the Oncomine database were analyzed to generate metastasis-free survival <lb/>curves. Samples were dichotomized based on the mean expression level of <lb/>MELK and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) method and Cox proportional hazards <lb/>model were used to determine statistical significance. To determine the <lb/>correlation between MELK expression and p53 regulated genes, we obtained <lb/>gene expression data from TCGA and Curtis data sets. Correlation curves and <lb/>Pearson&apos;s p-values and r 2 -values were generated using GraphPad Prism. <lb/></body>
