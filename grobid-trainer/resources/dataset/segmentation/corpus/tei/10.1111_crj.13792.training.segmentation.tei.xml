        <body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>Storage capacity of dammed reservoirs is being lost world-<lb/>wide due to sedimentation (Kondolf et al., 2014) and this <lb/>loss is estimated at 1% yearly of their total volume, although <lb/>in the areas particularly prone to erosion it can reach <lb/>much higher values (Bekri et al., 2021; Jain, 2005; Perera <lb/>et al., 2023; Rahmani et al., 2018; Sedláček et al., 2022). <lb/>Moreover, the forecasted changes in precipitation, tem-<lb/>peratures, and land use suggest that the intensity of this <lb/>phenomenon may increase significantly (Bussi et al., 2021; <lb/>Dethier et al., 2022; Pesci et al., 2023; Pieron et al., 2021; <lb/>Wei et al., 2020). One of the areas particularly affected by <lb/>erosional problems in Europe is covered by the range of <lb/>Western Carpathian Mts., shared mainly by Slovakia and <lb/>Poland, but also partially by Czech Republic, Hungary <lb/>and Austria (Absalon et al., 2023; Gil et al., 2021; Halecki <lb/>et al., 2018; Oskoruš et al., 2023). Dynamic changes, land <lb/>use and climate occurring in this area have a significant <lb/>impact on both the land and bed river phase of the sed-<lb/>iment transport (Kijowska-Strugała, 2019; Wilk, 2022). <lb/>Since the 1930s, several dammed reservoirs have been <lb/>built in the area of the Western Carpathians disrupting <lb/>sediment transport continuity, trapping bed material and <lb/>a majority of suspended sediment. Although reservoir sed-<lb/>imentation problems are reported frequently in different <lb/>climate zones (e.g. Asthana &amp; Khare, 2022; Iradukunda <lb/>&amp; Bwambale, 2021; Reisenbüchler et al., 2021; Ren <lb/>et al., 2021), they are discussed mainly in terms of sedi-<lb/>ment loads delivered into the reservoirs while the aspect <lb/>of tracking delivered particles inside of a reservoir is rarely <lb/>reported. Majority of the catchment modelling tools treat <lb/>reservoirs as points which results in load simulations only <lb/>for the opening/closing profiles (e.g. Kwarteng et al., 2021; <lb/>Mamede et al., 2018; Rabelo et al., 2021; Shrestha <lb/>et al., 2021; Zajac et al., 2017). Such an approach leads to <lb/>a vast generalization impairing knowledge on grain size <lb/>fraction transport issues and particle deposition areas. <lb/>Moreover, transport of sediments in river and reservoir <lb/>conditions has been usually studied using tools operating <lb/>at different spatial and temporal scales, often treating them <lb/>as separate units or largely generalizing the relationship <lb/>between them (Wilk, 2022). Meanwhile, a river-reservoir <lb/>arrangement is a dynamic, complex and, above all, integral <lb/>system with deep interactions, where processes responsi-<lb/>ble for the sediment transport are stochastic and variable. <lb/>To properly reflect them, it is necessary to combine various <lb/>modelling tools. However, such an integration is difficult <lb/>and limited by specific model codes, as well as formats and <lb/>data exchange between models. Moreover, there is still a <lb/>very limited use of such a solution (Guzman et al., 2015; <lb/>Nazari-Sharabian et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2019), especially <lb/>in mountainous areas. <lb/>The objective of this study is to present detailed infor-<lb/>mation on the sediment loads introduced to the reservoir <lb/>and their subsequent transport in the dammed reservoir <lb/>(Dobczycki Reservoir) located on the Raba River in south-<lb/>ern Poland (Western Carpathians). The presented data-<lb/>base results from the integration of two models SWAT <lb/>and AdH/PTM on a common digital space-Macromodel <lb/>(DNS)-allowing for detailed monitoring of sediment <lb/>transport in each zone of the dammed reservoir. This tool <lb/>allows the user to assess which zones of the reservoir are <lb/>currently, and will be in the future, most vulnerable to loss <lb/>of capacity and how the deposition areas of individual <lb/>fractions will change in the future climate and land use <lb/>scenarios. The information contained in this database can <lb/>also be successfully used in the development of models for <lb/>subsequent catchments in the analysed area and help in <lb/>the assessment of the impact of climate change on the ex-<lb/>isting or planned reservoirs in the Carpathians. Moreover, <lb/>the presented database makes an important step for model <lb/>integration, using their best features for a better under-<lb/>standing of current and future threats to the operation of <lb/>dammed reservoirs. <lb/>2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>2.1 | Study area <lb/>The study area covers the area of the upper Raba River <lb/>catchment which belongs to the Polish part of the Western <lb/>Carpathians, covering sub-catchments of the upper Vistula <lb/>River (Soła, Skawa, Raba, Dunajec, Biała, Wisłoka and <lb/>Wisłok Rivers) (Wyżga, Zawiejska, &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2016; <lb/>Wyżga, Zawiejska, &amp; Radecki-Pawlik, 2016). These catch-<lb/>ments have many common features, including the moun-<lb/>tainous character of their upper parts manifesting itself <lb/>in a quick reaction to rainfall and high dynamics of sur-<lb/>face runoff (Korpak et al., 2021; Wyżga et al., 2021). The <lb/>similar characteristic is also shared by the catchments on <lb/>the Slovak side [Rusnák et al., 2018; Barabas et al., 2017; <lb/>Lehotský et al., 2013]. <lb/>The Raba River flows 131 km from its source in the <lb/>Gorce Mountain range (780 m a.s.l.) to the Vistula River <lb/>(180 m a.s.l.) and features a dammed reservoir (Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir) at 60 km from the source (Figure 1). The part of <lb/>the Raba River catchment, localized upstream from the res-<lb/>ervoir, covers an area of 768 km 2 with 43% of the area cov-<lb/>ered by slopes over 25% and overgrown by forest. The river <lb/>flows are characterized by very large amplitudes, with max-<lb/>imum values recorded in the snow melt period, and early-<lb/>summer long-lasting rainfall events. The studied catchment <lb/>is covered generally by clays, and its lower slopes are used <lb/>mostly for agricultural activities (over 40%). The Dobczyce <lb/></body>

        <body>Reservoir was created mainly to provide drinking water <lb/>for approx. half a million people, and to regulate the river <lb/>flows. The reservoir has an area of approx. 10.7 km 2 (8 km by <lb/>1.6 km), and an average depth of 12 m (maximum of 35 m) <lb/>(Mazurkiewicz-Boron, 2016; Wilk-Woźniak et al., 2021). <lb/>The reservoir is divided into four zones (Figure 3) includ-<lb/>ing a river part (A), backwater (B), Myślenice basin (C) and <lb/>Dobczyce basin (D). The section downstream from the res-<lb/>ervoir has been also included in the current approach and <lb/>labelled as OUT. The entire area of the upper Raba River <lb/>catchment belongs to the Carpathian climatic region with <lb/>an average annual air temperature around 7°C (ampli-<lb/>tude of 21°C) and the average rainfall ranging from about <lb/>700 mm to about 1600 mm at the higher altitudes (Wypych <lb/>et al., 2018). <lb/>2.2 | Modelling tools <lb/>The study used SWAT and AdH/PTM models, combined <lb/>as modules on a digital platform-Macromodel DNS. The <lb/>SWAT module (version 2012.10_2.19) has been used to <lb/>simulate sediment yields from the catchment (land phase) <lb/>and sediment loads (river phase) delivered to the reservoir <lb/>in Myślenice calculation profile. Moreover, the SWAT <lb/>module has been also used to estimate the sediment loads <lb/>discharged into the dammed reservoir in future time <lb/>horizons under climate and land use changes. The use of <lb/>SWAT together with AdH/PTM combined the tracking of <lb/>the mass load (Euler approach) and the individual par-<lb/>ticle (Lagrange&apos;s approach) (Figure 2). For this purpose, <lb/>a number of representative particles were generated for <lb/>each fraction of suspended sediment, proportional to the <lb/>respective mass load calculated by the SWAT module for a <lb/>given month. This procedure was performed for the three <lb/>fractions of the sediment load, i.e. two mineral ones: CLAY <lb/>0-0.004 mm, SILT 0.004-0.062 mm and a mineral-organic <lb/>one: SMAG 0.03 mm. The sediment source generates the <lb/>set of particles in a three-dimensional Gaussian cloud <lb/>specified by median grain size (d) and standard deviation <lb/>(dev). Representative particles imitate the incoming sedi-<lb/>ment, but each of the particles is considered separately <lb/>in the computational process (Lagrange&apos;s approach). To <lb/>cover the above fractional ranges, the following param-<lb/>eters were used: CLAY d = 0.002 mm (dev = 1.25), SILT <lb/>d = 0.05 mm (dev = 1.2), SMAG d = 0.03 mm (no devia-<lb/>tion). The number of particles is proportional to the mass <lb/>of the sediment load supplied by the Raba River (SWAT <lb/>result). Consequently, these three individual sediment <lb/>fractions distribution has been tracked using the AdH/ <lb/>PTM module (Surface-water Modelling System model <lb/>package 13.2 by AQUAVEO) in individual zones of the <lb/>dammed reservoir. Hydraulic conditions in the dammed <lb/>reservoir for sediment load scenarios have been modelled <lb/>F I G U R E 1 The upper Raba River catchment with slopes, type of use, soil, division into sub-basins and a dammed reservoir divided into <lb/>four zones. <lb/></body>

        <body>area is shown in Figure 3. Sub-catchments located in <lb/>this area are characterized by the highest risk of soil loss, <lb/>which is presented in detail by Szalińska et al. (2020) and <lb/>Orlińska-Woźniak et al. (2020a). <lb/>The SWAT tool allows the user to select various meth-<lb/>ods and equations to simulate the individual components <lb/>of the water balance, depending on the availability of <lb/>input data. In the current approach, the following el-<lb/>ements of the SWAT module were used to simulate the <lb/>processes responsible for surface runoff and erosion in the <lb/>land phase as well as deposition and degradation in the <lb/>river bed phase: <lb/>• SCS-CN (USDA Soil Conservation Service) empirical <lb/>model (Bartlett et al., 2016; Shi &amp; Wang, 2020), which <lb/>is mainly based on soil properties, land use and hydro-<lb/>logical conditions and is widely used for surface runoff <lb/>estimation with daily precipitation as input. <lb/>• Modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) (Vigiak <lb/>et al., 2015), which is an example of a compromise be-<lb/>tween empirical and physical algorithms in the SWAT <lb/>module. It can predict soil erosion at the HRU level, <lb/>resulting in soil particle transport. MUSLE is a modi-<lb/>fied version of USLE based on the runoff characteris-<lb/>tics as the best single indicator for predicting sediment <lb/>performance at the basin outlet, and factors influencing <lb/>soil erosion. By using the energy of surface runoff, not <lb/>rainfall, MUSLE is suitable for use on a daily basis to <lb/>estimate the sediment efficiency, and takes into account <lb/>sediment deposition in HRU. <lb/>• Muskingum method, which directs water in a network <lb/>of canals using Manning&apos;s equation (Her et al., 2017; <lb/>Wilk, 2022). The suspended sediment transported with <lb/>the water is subject to deposition and degradation pro-<lb/>cesses. The SWAT module offers four methods of sim-<lb/>ulating these processes (Bagnold, Kodoatie, Molinas <lb/>and Wu, Yang Sand and Gravel). In the current study, <lb/>the Kodoatie method was chosen because it allowed <lb/>for analysing sediment load by individual fractions. <lb/>Moreover, it is considered to be particularly effective for <lb/>suspended and small sediment particles. This method <lb/>has been described as an empirical optimized sedi-<lb/>ment transport equation, using non-linear optimiza-<lb/>tion and field data for different river sediment particle <lb/>sizes (Lu &amp; Chiang, 2019; Yen et al., 2017) according to <lb/>Equation (1): <lb/>where: conc sed,ch,mx -maximum sediment concentration <lb/>(t/m 3 ); v ch -mean flow velocity (m/s); y is mean flow <lb/>depth (m); S-energy slope (m/m); Q in -water entering <lb/>the reach (m 3 ); a-reciprocal of the sediment source ef-<lb/>fectiveness (m 3 s/t); b, c and d-regression coefficients <lb/>for different bed materials; W -channel width at the <lb/>water level (m); and W btm -bottom width of the channel <lb/>(m). <lb/>• Penman-Monteith equation (Parajuli et al., 2018) was <lb/>used to describe the potential evapotranspiration (PET) <lb/>algorithms in this study. <lb/>• Meteorological data for precipitation, temperature (for <lb/>(eq 1) <lb/>conc sed,ch,mx = <lb/>a * v b <lb/>ch * y c * S d <lb/>Q in <lb/> * <lb/>W + W btm <lb/>2 <lb/>F I G U R E 3 Area, land use, slopes and soil for each sub-catchment of the upper Raba River. <lb/></body>

The Latin Hypercube (LH-OAT) (Zadeh <lb/>et al., 2022) was used to identify the most influential <lb/>model parameters. The model was calibrated and veri-<lb/>fied in terms of calculation profiles closing the upper <lb/>(Myślenice) and lower parts (Proszówki) of the catchment <lb/>area (Figure 4), using the 25-year flow data (1993-2017) <lb/>obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water <lb/>Management and the total suspended sediment concen-<lb/>trations from the National Monitoring System for the 13-<lb/>year period (2005-2017) (Table 3). <lb/>Due to the low frequency of the available sediment <lb/>monitoring data (12 times a year), the LOAD ESTimator <lb/>(LOADEST) <lb/>(https:// pubs. er. usgs. gov/ publi cation/ <lb/>tm4A5 ) program was used to reliably estimate continuous <lb/>loads data from measurements for calibration purpose. <lb/>Validation of the model was carried out for the Stradomka <lb/>River (a right-bank tributary of the Raba River), for which <lb/>suspended sediment monitoring measurements were <lb/>available. Four statistical measures were used to assess <lb/>the fit of the model to the monitoring results: determina-<lb/>tion coefficient (R 2 ) (Piepho, 2019), efficiency coefficient <lb/>of the Nash-Sutcliffe model (NSE) (Knoben et al., 2019), <lb/>percentage of load (PBIAS) (Mengistu et al., 2021) and <lb/>Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Knoben et al., 2019). The <lb/>respective ranges of these measures were based on (Libera <lb/>&amp; Sankarasubramanian, 2018; Patil &amp; Stieglitz, 2015; Xing <lb/>et al., 2018) are presented in Table 2. <lb/>For flow calibration R 2 , NSE and KGE classified the <lb/>model performance as good and very good, and PBIAS <lb/>obtained satisfactory values (Table 3). Calibration of sed-<lb/>iment for the upper Raba catchment showed satisfactory <lb/>results for R 2 and NSE and very good and good for PBIAS <lb/>and KGE. Better results were obtained for the lower part <lb/>of the catchment, where the efficiency of the model can be <lb/>considered very good (for R 2 ) and good (for NSE, PBIAS <lb/>and KGE). Model validation (for R 2 , PBIAS and KGE) <lb/>showed good model results, while only NSE obtained a <lb/>satisfactory value. For sediment, according to R 2 , NSE and <lb/>KGE, the performance of the model can be considered sat-<lb/>isfactory and good according to PBIAS (Table 3). <lb/>The finally calibrated and validated model was used for <lb/>the baseline scenario simulation of sediment loads for the <lb/>calculation profile of Myślenice, which was estimated for <lb/>the following fractions (CLAY, SILT and SMAG). <lb/>2.3.3 | Variant scenarios <lb/>The climate variant scenarios for the Raba River catch-<lb/>ment were prepared for the Krakow-Balice synoptic sta-<lb/>tion data based on the Development of Urban Adaptation <lb/>Plans (UAP) for cities with more than 100,000 inhabit-<lb/>ants in Poland (http:// 44mpa. pl/? lang= en). Data from <lb/>the UAP project with monthly time step for precipitation <lb/>and temperature were used to calculate delta change rates <lb/>for all climate change scenarios. The distance between <lb/>Kraków-Balice station and the Myślenice calculation pro-<lb/>file (29 km) and altitude difference (150 m) permitted to <lb/>use these data without necessity of any transposition, ac-<lb/>cording to both the World Meteorological Organization <lb/>(WMO) and IMGW-PIB recommendations (Derek <lb/>et al., 2014; WMO, 2017, 2018). <lb/>The UAP project predictions have been based on the <lb/>data from the Euro-CORDEX and Regional climate <lb/>models -RCM (on a regular grid with a resolution of <lb/>12.5 km) (Dosio, 2016; Rummukainen, 2016)-and the <lb/>Global Climate Models-GCM (Wootten et al., 2017; Yang <lb/>et al., 2019)-used to determine the boundary conditions. <lb/>Finally, an average of the ensemble, built of the 14 selected <lb/>F I G U R E 4 Comparison of measured and predicted monthly flows and sediment loads at calculation profiles Myślenice and Proszówki <lb/>during the calibration period (2005-2017). <lb/></body>

        <body>RCM models (Table 4) as the best reflecting the local an-<lb/>nual cycle of both precipitation and air temperature (no <lb/>gross errors detected), has been used. <lb/>In the UAP project, the accuracy of the Euro-CORDEX <lb/>forecasts was established by comparison with data from <lb/>historical observations of IMGW-PIB for the same period <lb/>of time (2006-2015). For the average annual rainfall and <lb/>temperature, the error rate did not exceed 1% (CV = 0.42). <lb/>For daily data, models giving gross errors, i.e. shifts of <lb/>the modelled series in the annual cycle, were rejected. <lb/>The analyses were performed for both the RCP4.5 and <lb/>RCP8.5 scenarios. Statistical postprocessing (downscal-<lb/>ing) was a part of a UAP project and performed using the <lb/>tools available in the R environment (R, 2020). The error <lb/>reduction was established by analysing each model of <lb/>Euro-CORDEX for each scenario and each meteorologi-<lb/>cal parameter for corresponding grid meshes of Kraków-<lb/>Balice included in the UAP project. The climate condition <lb/>analysis in the UAP project covered two future time hori-<lb/>zons: short-term perspective-calculated as an average of <lb/>the 2026-2035 period, and a long-term perspective-cal-<lb/>culated as an average of the 2046-2055 period. Therefore, <lb/>four climate variant scenarios, with a monthly time step, <lb/>were prepared to combine the RCP predictions and ad-<lb/>opted time horizons (Table 5). <lb/>Along with the climate change predictions, the land use <lb/>future changes, modified in SWAT model by the Landuse <lb/>Update tool, have also been taken into consideration and <lb/>were combined with each RCP scenario, since they occur <lb/>concurrently. Land use changes predictions were based <lb/>on results of the FORECOM project (Kolecka et al., 2017; <lb/>Kozak et al., 2017), and transposed into the analysed area <lb/>with use of the DYNA-Clue model for the future time <lb/>horizon of 2060 (Kozak et al., 2017; Price et al., 2017). <lb/>The FORECOM project was implemented on the basis of <lb/>Swiss Contribution covering the Carpathian region, an-<lb/>alysing the past of land use changes since the 19th cen-<lb/>tury, and the future in three forecast scenarios. Land use <lb/>maps of the Polish Carpathians included forecasts until <lb/>2060 with the resolution of 50 m. The &apos;trend&apos; scenario as-<lb/>sumed a further development trend that is currently ob-<lb/>served, the &apos;liberal&apos; scenario assumed that changes are <lb/>dictated by market mechanisms and the &apos;environmental&apos; <lb/>scenario assumed that policies and interventions aimed <lb/>at protecting the environment, landscape and biodiversity <lb/>play an important role in land use changes. The project <lb/>concluded that the area of the Carpathians will develop <lb/>at different rates. Using data on population distribution <lb/>from the Central Statistical Office (GUS, 2022) and on <lb/>forest cover and slopes from the Corine Land Cover, sub-<lb/>basins have been classified into appropriate groups rep-<lb/>resenting individual forecast scenarios (trend, liberal and <lb/>environmental) (Orlińska-Woźniak et al., 2020b).

        <body>only one land use scenario for the catchment area was <lb/>created. <lb/>2.4 | Sediment particle distribution <lb/>in the dammed reservoir <lb/>2.4.1 | Hydraulic and particle tracking <lb/>models set-up <lb/>To execute the sediment transport and deposition simu-<lb/>lations in the Dobczyce Reservoir, the AdH/PTM model <lb/>(Hachaj, 2018; Hachaj, 2019; Hachaj &amp; Szlapa, 2017) was <lb/>adapted in the current study. AdH is a 2D depth-averaged, <lb/>finite element, modelling tool for simulating hydrody-<lb/>namic conditions which uses the finite element method <lb/>to solve two-dimensional momentum conservation equa-<lb/>tions for water-in the Eulerian frame for both x and y <lb/>directions (Berger et al., 2010) according to Equation (2): <lb/>where: v x , v y -velocity components in and directions, re-<lb/>spectively (m/s); f x (m/s)-unitary force in the direction, <lb/>represented by wind-induced surface friction, wave impact; <lb/>f y (m/s)-unitary force (wind, waves…) in the y direction; C f <lb/>(1/s)-Coriolis factor; g (m/s)-gravitational acceleration, ϛ <lb/>(m)-water surface elevation, H (m)-depth, C (m½/s)-<lb/>Chezy roughness coefficient, v (m 2 /s) kinematic viscosity <lb/>coefficient, and p (Pa)-external pressure. <lb/>The bathymetric map and hydrologic data to set up the <lb/>hydrodynamic model for the Dobczyce Reservoir were <lb/>sourced from the reservoir management authority (State <lb/>Water Holding-Polish Waters). The boundary conditions <lb/>in the AdH module, i.e. inflow rate and water surface el-<lb/>evation level (WSE), were adapted to include monthly <lb/>Average High Flow (AHQ) (Luong et al., 2021; Wrzesiński <lb/>&amp; Sobkowiak, 2020) and normal water surface level-<lb/>269.9 m a.s.l. The simulation was performed with the de-<lb/>fault bottom roughness parameter and water density, as <lb/>well as the neglected impact of wind, wave and Coriolis <lb/>forces. The AHQ values were calculated using flow data <lb/>simulated by the SWAT module for each variant scenario <lb/>according to Equation (3): <lb/>where: AHQ (m 3 /s)-average high flow for a given month, <lb/>Y (-)-number of years within the data series and max (Qd ) <lb/>(m 3 /s)-the highest daily flow observed within a calendar <lb/>month (m index of AHQ and the max operator) of a given <lb/>year (y index of the max operator). <lb/>Particles inside of the Dobczyce Reservoir have been <lb/>tracked using the PTM module assuming that the output <lb/>of the SWAT model is the only source of particles intro-<lb/>duced into this reservoir. Since the Eulerian approach is <lb/>based on tracking a mass load while the Lagrangian one <lb/>uses a concept of tracking individual particles, thus, at <lb/>the connection point, a given mass load has to be trans-<lb/>formed into a given number of representative particles. <lb/>This issue has been solved by generating a number of rep-<lb/>resentative particles for each suspended sediment fraction <lb/>to be proportional to the appropriate mass load calculated <lb/>by the SWAT module for a given month (File 1_DATA_ <lb/>SWAT). This source area was set as an ellipsoid with a <lb/>centre point at 1.9 m above the bottom and vertical and <lb/>horizontal radii of 1 and 25 m, respectively. These dimen-<lb/>sions were determined by the shape of the riverbed in the <lb/>place where the sediment source is located and allowed <lb/>for the maximum filling of the selected profile with the <lb/>shape of an ellipsoid. Simulations were performed using <lb/>sediment density of 2650 and 1240 kg/m 3 for mineral par-<lb/>ticles and mineral/organic aggregates, respectively (Czuba <lb/>et al., 2015). As for the particle diameter, the following val-<lb/>ues have been adopted: CLAY d = 0.002 mm (dev = 1.25), <lb/>SILT d = 0.05 mm (dev = 1.2), SMAG d = 0.03 mm (no de-<lb/>viation). Consequently, the particle distribution has been <lb/>followed in all four reservoir zones (A, B, C, D). Moreover, <lb/>the number of particles flowing downstream of the res-<lb/>ervoir (OUT) has been also tracked (File 2_DATA_AdH/ <lb/>PTM). <lb/>2.4.2 | AdH/PTM models calibration and <lb/>validation <lb/>Since, the actual water velocity measurements with the <lb/>Dobczyce Reservoir were not available during the imple-<lb/>mentation of the hydrodynamic model consequently, the <lb/>so-called state-based approach to hydrodynamics has been <lb/>used.

        <body>data the model should be consistent with reality on the <lb/>generalized qualitative level. Hydrodynamic features like <lb/>locations of currents and stagnant areas should appear <lb/>in the same regions of the reservoir and maintain similar <lb/>shapes. This approach involves formal logic and Markov <lb/>process formalism instead of functional analysis and sta-<lb/>tistics. This methodology has been used for the Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir first by Bojarski et al. (2012) and then formal-<lb/>ized by Hachaj (2019). <lb/>The AdH model performance was assessed then by the <lb/>sensitivity analysis performed for the main variables ac-<lb/>countable for the model response to channel roughness <lb/>and wind forcing. As for the generalized Manning co-<lb/>efficient, the AdH model default value of 0.025 was ad-<lb/>opted in the current study. This value was adopted since <lb/>the differences among the modelled flow velocities along <lb/>the main current line were negligible for the coefficient <lb/>range of 0.0025-0.05, and only noticeable when the pa-<lb/>rameter value was set at an unreasonably high level of <lb/>0.25 (Figure 5). <lb/>As for the model response to the wind forcing, testing <lb/>was performed to verify the wind condition&apos;s impact on the <lb/>resulting velocity field. The impact of the wind appeared <lb/>to be important for low inflows (at the range of the modal <lb/>inflow, approx. 2 m 3 /s), but negligible for values higher <lb/>than the mean value for this reservoir (approx. 10 m 3 /s). <lb/>The AdH model simulation results for the Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir were validated through comparison with pre-<lb/>viously observed reservoir features, like appearance of <lb/>current patterns and stagnant areas, as well as typical <lb/>transport times/velocities in the reservoir selected basins <lb/>(Hachaj, 2019). Ultimately, the state-based approach has <lb/>been validated on 208 velocity measurement points in an-<lb/>other storage reservoir (Włocławek) (Tutro et al., 2022) <lb/>reaching relative root mean square error (RRMSE) in a <lb/>range of 7.9*10 -5 and 1.6*10 -4 . <lb/>The PTM model validation was performed through <lb/>comparison between results of sediment deposition simu-<lb/>lation and grain distribution analyses for the dammed res-<lb/>ervoir bottom sediments (Szlapa, 2019) and localization <lb/>of progressive shallowing areas observed in satellite im-<lb/>ages for over 20 years (1997-2017) (Bojarski et al., 2012). <lb/>Comparison of granulometric analysis results (13 profiles <lb/>containing 3-4 sample points distributed evenly along the <lb/>reservoir) with the PTM simulations for SILT revealed a <lb/>PBIAS value of -21%, which signifies very good model <lb/>performance (Figure 6). <lb/>Moreover, superimposition of the simulation re-<lb/>sults with the bathymetric survey map of the Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir showed a good reflection of sedimentation <lb/>F I G U R E 5 Simulated main current velocities (AdH model) in the Dobczyce Reservoir for different generalized Manning coefficient <lb/>values. <lb/></body>

The file format is Excel files <lb/>(.xlsx). Additional maps displaying distribution of par-<lb/>ticles in the Dobczyce Reservoir with the monthly con-<lb/>ditions are also presented in this data set. The dataset <lb/>consists of three main parts (File 1_DATA_SWAT, File <lb/>2_DATA_AdH/PTM and File 3_Maps) which are di-<lb/>vided into sheets. The database flow has been presented <lb/>in Figure 8. <lb/>The calibrated and validated SWAT model for the <lb/>upper Raba River was used to run simulations for the <lb/>period of 13 years (2005-2017), considering both dry and <lb/>wet periods. Extracted data on flow simulations (FLOW <lb/>in m 3 /s) with the daily time step and the averaged sed-<lb/>iment fraction loads (CLAY, SILT and SMAG in tonnes/ <lb/>month, t/m) with the monthly time step in the Myślenice <lb/>calculation profile for the baseline scenario are presented <lb/>in File 1_DATA_SWAT, sheet: SWAT-BASE. The obtained <lb/>results for the base scenario allow for tracking of the loads <lb/>of individual sediment fractions delivered to the reservoir <lb/>in particular months of the year and to indicate those in <lb/>which these loads reach high values. <lb/>The three analysed sediment fractions have different <lb/>monthly distributions; however, for all of them, two peri-<lb/>ods can be distinguished: October to April with low loads <lb/>and May to September with high loads. The high loads <lb/>reach 270, 891 and 3.3 t/m on average for CLAY, SILT and <lb/>SMAG in the period from May to August, respectively. In <lb/>general, the sediment loads introduced into the Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir have been dominated by CLAY, with the maxi-<lb/>mum of loads delivered in June, constituting 66% of total <lb/>sediment loads in this month. <lb/>On the other hand, the effects of the implementation of <lb/>subsequent variant scenarios, combining climate and land <lb/>use changes affecting both flows and loads of individual <lb/>sediment fractions, can be tracked in File 1_DATA_SWAT, <lb/>sheets: SWAT-VS1-VS4.

For the CLAY fraction loads, <lb/>an increase in winter and spring by even over 250% can <lb/>be observed. For SILT loads increase by 130%, in spring, <lb/>while for SMAG loads decrease in both seasons can be <lb/>noticed. <lb/>The results of the flow and the sediment simulations <lb/>converted into representative particles (as described in <lb/>Section 2.3.1) were used as input for the AdH/PTM mod-<lb/>elling part. This module allowed for the tracking of sed-<lb/>iment fractions&apos; particles in the subsequent zones of the <lb/>dammed reservoir. In the File 2_DATA_AdHPTM, the <lb/>data were extracted for the coordinates (UTM Zone 34_ <lb/>Northern Hemisphere) and of particles&apos; diameters (mm) <lb/>assigned to the appropriate fractions. Moreover, their <lb/>deposition locations in the subsequent reservoir zones (A, <lb/>B, C and D) in the baseline (AdHPTM-BASE) and variant <lb/>scenarios (AdHPTM-VS1-4) have been given. In addition, <lb/>sediment particles that have been transported down-<lb/>stream from the reservoir (OUT) into the lower part of the <lb/>Raba River (designated as -9999.9 coordinates) are also <lb/>included in these sheets. The pivot column charts, as pre-<lb/>sented for example in Figure 10, allow the user to easily <lb/>compare the amount of deposited particles in each zone <lb/>of the reservoir (Figure 10). <lb/>The File 3_Maps constitutes a graphical supplement to <lb/>the tabular results presented in File 2_DATA_AdHPTM. <lb/>These maps allow the user to track the particles of anal-<lb/>ysed sediment fractions (differentiated by colours) in sub-<lb/>sequent zones of the dammed reservoir for each month <lb/>(JAN-DEC) and scenario (base and VS1-4). As presented <lb/>for example in Figure 11, visible changes in deposition <lb/>area for all the particle fractions can be observed for the <lb/>studied reservoir zones in April when base and VS4 sce-<lb/>narios are compared. Additionally, movement of SILT <lb/>and CLAY particles can be tracked through the mp4 file <lb/>(Video S1). <lb/>In general, our database shows that over 80% of all frac-<lb/>tions flowing into the studied reservoir will be deposited in <lb/>its two main reservoir&apos;s basins (zones C and D). However, <lb/>monthly cycle trends and response for implemented sce-<lb/>narios are different for each fraction. The SMAG presence <lb/>will be observed mainly from May till September and de-<lb/>posited in the backwater zone (B). The SILT fraction will <lb/>be deposited in autumn-spring in the river zone (A), but <lb/>F I G U R E 7 Superimposition of the bedforms obtained during the simulation with the results of the bathymetric survey of the Dobczyce <lb/>Reservoir. <lb/></body>
