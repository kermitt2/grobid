			<body> Introduction <lb/> The cellular level of cGMP is controlled by a balance of guanylyl <lb/>cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities [1,2]. For example, nitric <lb/>oxide (NO) activates soluble guanylyl cyclases to generate cGMP, <lb/>which ultimately causes vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure. <lb/>The cGMP dependent protein kinase PKG is one of the key effectors <lb/>of cGMP signaling [3]. Although the physiological roles of <lb/>mammalian PKGs had been extensively studied using genetically <lb/>engineered mice, few molecular targets of PKGs were discovered to <lb/>date that could account for the extensive effect of PKG activation in <lb/>cardiovascular, digestive and nervous systems [3]. We study the C. <lb/> elegans PKG ortholog, EGL-4, in order to discover additional <lb/>evolutionarily conserved molecular effectors of cGMP-PKG singaling. <lb/>Environmental conditions dictate larval developmental decisions <lb/>and a number of adult behaviors such as foraging and egg laying in the <lb/>free living nematode C. elegans. Animals navigate towards food source <lb/>and away from unfavorable growth conditions, such as sub-optimal <lb/>temperature, high population density and pathogenic organisms [4–6]. <lb/>This is achieved through detection of environmental conditions by <lb/>dedicated sensory neurons and integration of signals in higher order <lb/>neurons, which then instruct physiological and locomotory responses <lb/>via efferent neurons and neuroendocrine signals. In C. elegans, insulin, <lb/>TGF-b and cGMP signaling pathways have been implicated in <lb/>organismal homeostasis in response to changes in environmental <lb/>conditions [7–12]. While the effectors of insulin and TGF-b pathways <lb/>have been elucidated by genetic and biochemical analysis [13–16], <lb/>how cGMP signaling leads to coordinated physiological responses <lb/>throughout the body is poorly understood. It is known that cGMP <lb/>activates cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGs) that alter membrane <lb/>potential of neurons [17–19]. In addition, cGMP activates cGMP <lb/>dependent protein kinase (PKG), whose downstream effectors that <lb/>mediate coordinated physiological responses to environmental and <lb/>developmental signals have not been identified in C. elegans. <lb/> Mutant alleles of the C. elegans cGMP dependent protein kinase <lb/>EGL-4 were originally identified from a genetic screen for egg <lb/>laying defective mutants [20]. Subsequently, EGL-4 was found to <lb/>regulate diverse processes such as chemotaxis, olfactory adaptation, <lb/>foraging behavior, body length, dauer arrest and adult life-span <lb/>[21–25]. It has also been reported that EGL-4 is required for <lb/>behavioral quiescence, in response to food or ectopic epidermal <lb/>growth factor signaling [12,26,27]. Regulation of foraging behavior <lb/>by PKG appears to be conserved in Drosophila as the expression level <lb/>of the PKG ortholog foraging dictates sitter versus rover phenotype in <lb/></body>

			<body> larvae [28]. While EGL-4 acts in sensory neurons to modulate <lb/>foraging behavior [22,24], EGL-4 is also expressed throughout the <lb/>body and regulates body length from a number of tissues [29]. <lb/>Major questions remain regarding how EGL-4 activity is trans-<lb/>duced in different tissues throughout the body. For example, the <lb/>time-scale of various physiological responses following EGL-4 <lb/>activation is unknown. In addition, the cytoplasmic versus nuclear <lb/>function of EGL-4, and its molecular effectors in these subcellular <lb/>compartments have not been clearly defined. <lb/>The C. elegans EGL-4 is most homologous to mammalian PKG-<lb/>Ib, which has an auto-inhibitory domain at its N-terminus, <lb/>followed by two cGMP binding domains and a kinase domain [3]. <lb/>PKG is normally held inactive by its auto-inhibitory domain and is <lb/>activated through cooperative binding of cGMP, whose level is <lb/>controlled by opposing action of guanylyl cyclase and phospho-<lb/>diesterase [1,2]. PKG is known to regulate smooth muscle tone in <lb/>response to elevation of cGMP as a result of soluble guanylyl <lb/>cyclase activation by nitric oxide [3]. A handful of PKG targets <lb/>have been identified that account for the cytoplasmic role of PKG <lb/>in smooth muscles [3,30–32]. In addition, it has been suggested <lb/>that PKG activity may also affect gene expression in cell culture <lb/>systems [33,34]. However, the molecular mechanisms that <lb/>underlie nuclear PKG activity are not fully understood. <lb/>To address how EGL-4 and its downstream effectors may <lb/>coordinate physiological responses upon changes in environmental <lb/>conditions, we characterized a C. elegans mutant that expresses a <lb/>constitutively active EGL-4/PKG. Our analyses revealed genomic <lb/>effects of EGL-4 activity via a conserved histone deacetylase <lb/>complex. We also present evidence that EGL-4 activity can <lb/>modulate the expression of a novel extracellular signaling protein, <lb/>which illustrates how EGL-4 may exert cell non-autonomous effects. <lb/> Results <lb/> EGL-4/PKG regulates foraging behavior and egg-laying <lb/>rate <lb/> We isolated mg410, a dominant egl-4 gain-of-function allele from <lb/>a genetic screen for mutants with elevated Nile Red staining in the <lb/>absence of a functional peroxisomal thiolase, kat-1 [35]. The egl-<lb/>4(mg410) mutant animals display pleiotropic phenotypes such as <lb/>excessive dwelling and reduced body length (Figure 1A, Table 1). <lb/>These animals also have elevated egg-laying rate, since they lay <lb/>eggs with embryos younger than the gastrula stage and as early as <lb/>the 8-cell stage (Figure 1B) and the number of eggs in their uterus <lb/>is significantly reduced (Table 1). Molecular cloning revealed that <lb/> mg410 encoded a single amino acid substitution K162N <lb/>(Figure 1C). Lysine 162 in EGL-4 is a key residue of a conserved <lb/>pseudo-substrate motif that was shown to be critical for cGMP <lb/>dependent activation of mammalian PKG [36]. Mutation of the <lb/>pseudo-substrate motif causes constitutive activation of PKG and <lb/>auto-phosphorylation [36]. Accordingly, EGL-4(K162N) under-<lb/>went auto-phosphorylation in the presence or absence of cGMP in <lb/>an in vitro kinase assay (Figure 1D). Auto-phosphorylation was not <lb/>detected in the EGL-4(K499A) kinase dead mutant control. <lb/>To confirm that the mg410 allele, and the corresponding K162N <lb/>substitution, is responsible for the pleiotropic phenotypes associated <lb/>with constitutive activation of EGL-4, we isolated multiple intragenic <lb/> egl-4(mg410) suppressor alleles. Among them, hj32, a null allele that <lb/>encodes a pre-mature stop codon for a complete loss of EGL-4 <lb/>protein (Figure 1C, Figure S1A). The hj32 allele confers strong egl-4 <lb/> loss-of-function phenotypes similar to the canonical allele n479 [22] <lb/>(Table 1). In addition, we identified two weak egl-4 loss-of-function <lb/>alleles, hj33 and hj40. These are missense alleles that encode single <lb/>amino acid substitutions in the EGL-4 kinase domain (Figure 1C). <lb/>The egl-4(mg410hj33) and egl-4(mg410hj40) mutant animals are <lb/>phenotypically similar to wild-type animals (Table 1), suggesting that <lb/>these missense alleles confer a partial loss of EGL-4 kinase activity. <lb/>Foraging behavior and egg laying rate are controlled by <lb/>dedicated neuronal circuits that couple sensory inputs with motor <lb/>outputs. It is plausible that the pleiotropic phenotypes of the egl-4 <lb/> gain-of-function (gf) mutant are due to developmental defects of <lb/>specific neuronal circuits. Alternatively, EGL-4 may regulate <lb/>foraging behavior and egg laying frequency by affecting the activity <lb/>of pre-established circuits. To distinguish between these possibilities, <lb/>we transiently expressed a constitutively active (K162N) or kinase <lb/>dead (K499A) form of EGL-4 that carries a FLAG-epitope tag <lb/>under the control of a heat-shock promoter in wild-type animals. <lb/>These animals were allowed to develop to young adult stage when <lb/>all neuronal circuits are established. After heat-shock, the FLAG-<lb/>tagged EGL-4 reached steady-state level in 2 hours and started <lb/>waning after 12 hours (Figure 1E, Figure S1B and S1C). Expression <lb/>level of the FLAG-tagged EGL-4 was comparable to the <lb/>endogenous protein (Figure 1E). Using the Worm Tracker program <lb/>for quantitative analysis of foraging behavior [37], we found no <lb/>significant difference in foraging behavior between wild-type <lb/>animals and animals that expressed constitutively active (hjIs28) or <lb/>kinase dead EGL-4 (hjIs30), 2 hours after heat-shock when the <lb/>expression level of ectopic EGL-4 peaked (Figure 1F, Figure S1D). <lb/>The percentage dwell time of all three strains increased, which <lb/>might be caused by the heat-shock treatment 2 hours prior to our <lb/>measurement. However, ectopic expression of the constitutively <lb/>active EGL-4 (hjIs28) caused excessive dwelling when compared <lb/>with wild-type animals and the kinase dead control (hjIs30) 24 hours <lb/>after heat-shock (Figure 1F, Figure S1D). The excessive dwelling <lb/>was comparable to that of egl-4(gf) mutant animals. The same <lb/>temporal effect was observed on egg laying frequency upon ectopic <lb/>expression of a constitutively active EGL-4 (Figure 1G, Figure S1E). <lb/>We concluded that excessive dwelling and elevated egg laying <lb/>frequency in egl-4(gf) animals were not due to a defect in neuronal <lb/>circuit assembly. Given the delayed effects of EGL-4 activation, we <lb/>hypothesize that EGL-4 may mount a transcriptional program that <lb/>triggers sustained changes on established neuronal circuits. <lb/> Author Summary <lb/> Nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors raise the intra-<lb/>cellular level of cGMP, and they have been widely used to <lb/>treat hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Although it is <lb/>known that cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent protein <lb/>kinase PKG, which in turn causes smooth muscle relaxation <lb/>and other physiological responses, very few molecular <lb/>targets of PKG have been identified. In addition, the long-<lb/>term effects of sustained elevation of cGMP and PKG <lb/>activation are not known. We study a family member of PKG <lb/>called EGL-4 in the nematode C. elegans. Using a <lb/>combination of unbiased forward genetic screen and <lb/>proteomic analysis, we show that constitutively active <lb/>EGL-4 alters gene expression in multiple tissues, which is <lb/>achieved through activity-dependent recruitment of a <lb/>conserved Class I histone deacetylase complex in the <lb/>nucleus. Furthermore, we identify a novel EGL-4–responsive <lb/>gene that encodes a putative secreted protein that <lb/>modulates the egg laying rate of C. elegans. Taken together, <lb/>our results uncover novel PKG targets in the nucleus that <lb/>respond to sustained elevation of cGMP. Development of <lb/>chemicals that modulate the activity of these PKG targets <lb/>may differentiate or alleviate undesirable side-effects of <lb/>existing drugs that manipulate cGMP level. <lb/></body>

			<body> Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a role for EGL-4 in regulating <lb/>short-term synaptic activity. <lb/> SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 act downstream of EGL-4/PKG <lb/> To identify downstream effectors of the activated EGL-4 kinase, <lb/>we mutagenized egl-4(gf) animals for mutant alleles that suppressed <lb/>their excessive dwelling behavior. These alleles fell into two <lb/>complementation groups, defining two suppressor of activated <lb/>EGL-4 (saeg-) genes. Several lines of evidence suggest that saeg-1 and <lb/> saeg-2 are likely to encode ubiquitous downstream effectors of EGL-<lb/>4. First, recessive mutations in saeg-1 and saeg-2 genes strongly <lb/>suppressed excessive dwelling, accelerated egg laying rate and short <lb/>body length of egl-4(gf) animals (Figure 2A, Table 1). Second, loss of <lb/> saeg-2 function suppressed the behavioral phenotypes triggered by <lb/>ectopic expression of a constitutively active EGL-4 (Figure S1D and <lb/>S1E). Third, loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2 function did not drastically alter <lb/> egl-4 mRNA levels and more importantly, endogenous EGL-4 <lb/>protein level remained constant (Figure S2A and S2B). Since there is <lb/>no phenotypic difference between egl-4(gf); saeg-1, egl-4(gf); saeg-2 and <lb/> egl-4(gf); saeg-1; saeg-2 mutant animals (Figure 2A, Table 1), we <lb/>conclude that saeg-1 and saeg-2 act in the same genetic pathway. <lb/>We isolated four recessive alleles of saeg-1. Molecular cloning <lb/>revealed that saeg-1 encodes a C2H2 zinc-finger protein that also <lb/>contains the conserved ELM2 [38] and SANT domains [39] <lb/>(Figure 2B). Based on sequence homology and molecular <lb/>architecture, SAEG-1 is orthologous to human transcriptional <lb/>regulating factor 1 (TRERF1; Gene ID: 55809) and zinc-finger <lb/>protein 541 (ZNF541; Gene ID: 84215) [40,41]. We generated a <lb/>rescuing transgene using 29 kb of genomic sequence that <lb/>encompassed the saeg-1 gene and inserted the green fluorescent <lb/> Figure 1.

			<body> protein (GFP) coding sequence immediately 59 to the saeg-1 stop <lb/>codon. We found that SAEG-1::GFP is a ubiquitous nuclear protein <lb/>(Figure 2C). The zinc-finger is required for SAEG-1 function <lb/>because animals carrying the hj11 allele, which encodes a leucine <lb/>substitution for one of the zinc coordinating histidines, is <lb/>phenotypically indistinguishable to those carrying the hj12 allele, a <lb/>nonsense allele that causes severe reduction of saeg-1 transcript level. <lb/>We focused our phenotypic analysis on saeg-1(hj12) animals. <lb/>The saeg-2 gene was defined by a single recessive allele, hj9, from <lb/>our genetic screen. The hj9 allele encodes a guanine to adenine <lb/>substitution that eliminates the consensus splice donor site of the <lb/>third intron. A second allele of saeg-2, ok3174, was isolated by the C. <lb/>elegans Knockout Consortium. Both hj9 and ok3174 alleles are <lb/>molecular null alleles because no SAEG-2 protein is detectable in <lb/>animals carrying either alleles, which show comparable phenotypes <lb/>(Table 1, Figure S2C). The SAEG-2 protein is orthologous to <lb/>mammalian terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase interacting pro-<lb/>tein 1 (Dnttip1; Gene ID: 116092) [42]. We generated a rescuing, <lb/>single-copy transgene hjSi15 that expressed a SAEG-2::GFP fusion <lb/>protein under the control of the endogenous saeg-2 promoter. <lb/>Similar to SAEG-1::GFP, SAEG-2::GFP is expressed ubiquitously <lb/>and is localized to the nucleus (Figure 2D). The nuclear localization <lb/>of SAEG-2::GFP is not dependent on EGL-4 activity (Figure S2D). <lb/>Taken together, our results suggest that SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 are <lb/>nuclear effectors of EGL-4, perhaps by modulating gene expression <lb/>in response to EGL-4 activity. This is consistent with the latent <lb/>manifestation of foraging and egg laying phenotypes upon ectopic <lb/>expression of an activated form of EGL-4. <lb/> Physical interaction between EGL-4/PKG, SAEG-1, and <lb/>SAEG-2 is conserved <lb/> We observed that endogenous, wild-type or constitutively active <lb/>EGL-4 kinase is enriched in the nucleus (Figure S3). Nuclear EGL-<lb/>4::GFP fusion protein has also been observed in most neurons <lb/>[43]. Given that SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 are nuclear localized <lb/>(Figure 2C and 2D), we wondered if EGL-4/PKG, SAEG-1 and <lb/>SAEG-2 could physically interact with each other. Indeed, the <lb/>mammalian orthologs of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, TRERF1 and <lb/>Dnttip1 respectively, have been shown to interact with each other <lb/> in vitro [44]. We confirmed that SAEG-2 co-immunoprecipitated <lb/>with itself and with SAEG-1, but not the yellow fluorescent protein <lb/>Venus when over-expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Figure 3A, lanes <lb/>3 and 4; Figure S4A, lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, SAEG-1 and <lb/>SAEG-2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with constitutively <lb/>active or kinase dead forms of EGL-4 in the same over-expression <lb/>system (Figure 3B, lanes 5-8, Figure S4B, lanes 8, 10 and 12). We <lb/>also found that the interactions between EGL-4, SAEG-1 and <lb/>SAEG-2 are conserved for their mammalian orthologs (Figure 3C– <lb/>3E, Figure S4C and S4D). Finally, we tested the interaction <lb/>between endogenous SAEG-2 and EGL-4 when both were <lb/>expressed at physiological level in C. elegans. We found that <lb/>endogenous, activated EGL-4 from egl-4(gf) animals specifically <lb/>associated with SAEG-2 (Figure 3F, lane 6). In contrast, there was <lb/>no physical association between SAEG-2 and EGL-4 in its basal <lb/>state as found in wild-type animals under the same experimental <lb/>conditions (Figure 3F, lane 5). Our results indicate that EGL-4 <lb/>modulates gene expression by recruiting the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 <lb/>complex in an activity dependent manner. <lb/> SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 form a conserved histone <lb/>deacetylase complex <lb/> Since the interaction between SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 is <lb/>conserved from C. elegans to mammals, we asked whether SAEG-<lb/>1 and SAEG-2 and their mammalian orthologs are part of a larger <lb/>protein complex that mediates EGL-4/PKG activity.

			<body> expressed either FLAG-epitope tagged ZNF541 (SAEG-1 ortho-<lb/>log) or Dnttip1 (SAEG-2 ortholog). Immunoprecipitation was <lb/>followed by Multi-Dimensional Protein Identification Technology <lb/>(MuDPIT) analysis [45], in order to identify proteins that <lb/>associated with ZNF541 and Dnttip1 in independent samples <lb/>(Figure 4A). In agreement with our previous results, endogenous <lb/>Dnttip1 was detected in the ZNF541 protein complex, while <lb/>endogenous TRERF1 and LOC91748, another protein contain-<lb/>ing ELM2-SANT domains, were found in the Dnttip1 protein <lb/>complex. In addition, we found that histone deacetylase 1 <lb/>(HDAC1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) were the only <lb/>proteins that consistently associated with both ZNF541 and <lb/>Dnttip1. We verified the interaction between HDAC1, ZNF541 <lb/>and Dnttip1 (Figure 4B, lanes 4 and 8) and concluded that <lb/>ZNF541 and Dnttip1 are components of a novel histone <lb/>deacetylase complex. The C. elegans HDA-2 is the closest ortholog <lb/>of mammalian HDAC1 and HDAC2 and it co-immunoprecipi-<lb/>tated with SAEG-2 when over-expressed in Drosophila S2 cells <lb/>(Figure 4C, lane 2). However, we did not detect significant <lb/>association between SAEG-1 and HDA-2 (YAH and HYM, <lb/>unpublished data). It is plausible that SAEG-2 serves as an anchor <lb/>by simultaneously interacting with SAEG-1 and HDA-2. <lb/>If the association of HDA-2 with SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 is <lb/>required to mediate EGL-4 activity, then a loss of hda-2 function <lb/>should mimic the loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2. Indeed, loss of hda-2 <lb/> function partially suppressed the excessive dwelling, accelerated <lb/>egg laying and short body length phenotypes of egl-4(gf) animals <lb/>(Figure 4D and 4E, Table 1). Suppression of egl-4(gf) phenotypes <lb/>by loss of hda-2 function could be reversed with an hda-2p::hda-2(+) <lb/> transgene, demonstrating the specificity of such genetic interaction <lb/>(Figure 4D and 4E, Table 1). Furthermore, loss of hda-3 or hda-4, <lb/> which encodes two closely related histone deacetylases, failed to <lb/>suppress the egl-4(gf) phenotypes (Figure 4E, Table 1). Taken <lb/>together, our results suggest that SAEG-1, SAEG-2 and HDA-2 <lb/>form a histone deacetylase complex that is a nuclear effector of <lb/>EGL-4 activity. <lb/> Regulation of egg-laying rate by an EGL-4–responsive <lb/>gene <lb/> Our results point to a molecular pathway in which activated <lb/>EGL-4/PKG kinase engages a conserved histone deacetylase <lb/>complex that modulates expression of key regulators of foraging <lb/>behavior and egg laying rate. We hypothesized that such EGL-4 <lb/>activity responsive genes are most likely repressed in egl-4(gf) <lb/> animals in a SAEG-1/SAEG-2 dependent manner. These genes <lb/>should also be de-repressed or activated in egl-4(lf) animals. <lb/>Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling using Affyme-<lb/>trix microarrays on RNA samples extracted from wild-type, egl-<lb/>4(gf), egl-4(lf) and egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf) mutant animals at the late <lb/>larval L4 and young adult stage. By focusing on genes that showed <lb/> .1.5-fold change in expression (p,0.05) when compared with <lb/>wild-type samples, we identified 60 genes that were repressed in <lb/> egl-4(gf) and activated in egl-4(lf) animals (Figure 5A). The <lb/>expression of 43 out of these 60 genes was normalized close to <lb/>wild-type level (,1.5-fold change) in egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf) animals. In <lb/>addition, 5 out of these 60 genes were de-repressed and activated <lb/>(.1.5-fold) in the same animals. These results demonstrate that <lb/>EGL-4 modulates gene expression almost entirely through SAEG-<lb/>1, and by inference the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex. Although we <lb/>have identified a group of genes whose expression was highly <lb/>responsive to EGL-4 activity, our results did not imply direct <lb/>recruitment of the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex to their promoters. <lb/>We focused our analysis on Y45F10C.2 as an EGL-4 activity <lb/>responsive gene because it showed the maximal differential <lb/>expression in egl-4(gf) versus egl-4(lf) animals (Figure 5B). Further-<lb/>more, Y45F10C.2 expression is de-repressed in egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf) <lb/> animals. We verified the gene expression changes in Y45F10C.2 <lb/>by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 5C). The Y45F10C.2 gene <lb/>encodes a novel protein with a predicted secretory peptide and it <lb/>belongs to the DUF1505 family whose members contain 6 highly <lb/>conserved cysteine residues. A duplicate of Y45F10C.2, <lb/>C08F11.12, was found 10 kb away from its 39 end. The <lb/>Y45F10C.2 and C08F11.12 genes differ by a single nucleotide <lb/>polymorphism in the coding sequence and their 59 intergenic <lb/>regulatory sequences are .98% identical over ,775 bp. Our <lb/>microarray and real-time PCR analysis allowed us to monitor the <lb/>expression changes in both genes simultaneously and we found <lb/>that the two genes had similar function (NXU and HYM, <lb/>unpublished data). For simplicity, we will use Y45F10C.2 as a <lb/>representative gene name hereafter. <lb/>The expression level of Y45F10C.2 closely correlated with the <lb/>egg laying phenotype of our allelic series of egl-4 mutant animals <lb/>and by extension the EGL-4 activity (Figure 5C). Mild elevation of <lb/>egg-laying rate in saeg-1 or saeg-2 single mutant animals also <lb/>correlated well with a ,2-fold reduction of Y45F10C.2 expression <lb/>level (Figure 5C). Using a bi-cistronic transgene in which <lb/>Y45F10C.2 and GFP expression were under the control of the <lb/>Y45F10C.2 promoter, we found that the promoter was most active <lb/>in the uterine epithelium (Figure 5E). It is plausible that EGL-4 <lb/>regulates Y45F10C.2 in a cell-autonomous manner, since <lb/>endogenous nuclear EGL-4 was detected in uterine epithelial cells <lb/>(Figure S5). <lb/>Over-expression of Y45F10C.2 also caused a severe reduction <lb/>in egg-laying rate and retention of fertilized eggs, a phenotype <lb/>shared by egl-4(lf) animals where Y45F10C.2 expression was high <lb/>(Figure 5D and 5E). The egg-laying phenotype triggered by <lb/>Y45F10C.2 over-expression was specific because substitution of a <lb/>highly conserved cysteine with alanine (Cys36Ala) in Y45F10C.2 <lb/>abolished its ability to promote egg retention (Figure 5D and 5F). <lb/>We note that Y45F10C.2 may be sufficient but not necessary for <lb/>modulating egg-laying rate, because knock-down by RNA <lb/>interference (RNAi) did not affect egg-laying in wild-type animals, <lb/>perhaps due to functional compensation by other DUF1505 family <lb/>members (NXU and HYM, unpublished data). Finally, the <lb/>Y45F10C.2 transgene was not expressed in egl-4(gf) animals, <lb/>consistent with the observation that the endogenous Y45F10C.2 <lb/>gene was highly repressed in these animals (Figure 5G). Our results <lb/>suggest that Y45F10C.2 is a target gene that regulates egg laying in <lb/>response to EGL-4 activity and it may act in parallel of other <lb/>EGL-4 effectors and the neuronal circuit that controls vulval <lb/>muscles contraction. <lb/> Discussion <lb/> In this paper, we combine genetic, proteomic and genomic <lb/>approaches to determine how a cGMP dependent protein kinase, <lb/>EGL-4, modulates gene expression. Activated EGL-4 preferen-<lb/>tially associates with a conserved SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone <lb/> fusion protein.

			<body> deacetylase complex, which in turn represses a novel gene that <lb/>regulates egg-laying rate (Figure 6). Our results demonstrate that <lb/>in additional to cytoplasmic roles in Drosophila and mammals <lb/>[3,46], cGMP dependent kinase can act in the nucleus to elicit <lb/>long-term transcriptional changes that affect multiple physiological <lb/>processes such as foraging behavior, egg laying rate and body <lb/>length in C. elegans. <lb/> We propose that EGL-4 plays a central role in linking sensory <lb/>input regarding environmental conditions to long-term physiolog-<lb/>ical responses by altering gene expression of intracellular and <lb/>extracellular signaling molecules. Although nuclear function of <lb/>EGL-4 and mammalian PKG had been suggested in the past, in <lb/>part through the demonstration of EGL-4/PKG nuclear translo-<lb/>cation [33,43,47], the effectors of nuclear EGL-4/PKG activity in <lb/>vivo had been ill-defined. Given the ubiquitous expression of EGL-<lb/>4, SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, and the requirement of SAEG-1 and <lb/>SAEG-2 by EGL-4 in multiple physiological processes, our results <lb/>support a model in which the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex mediates <lb/>EGL-4 activity in the nucleus in diverse tissues. Nevertheless, we <lb/>noted that loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2 function was not equivalent to a <lb/>complete loss of egl-4 function (Table 1). This suggests that EGL-4 <lb/>activity can be mediated by alternative nuclear or cytoplasmic <lb/>pathways in parallel of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 (Figure 6). For <lb/>example, EGL-4 has been reported to modulate gene expression of <lb/>two chemosensory receptors, str-1 and str-3, through inhibition of <lb/>the histone deacetylase HDA-4 [48]. It is plausible that EGL-4 <lb/>engages different histone deacetylase complexes in a context <lb/>dependent manner. <lb/>We took a non-biased genomic approach to identify EGL-4 <lb/>activity responsive genes. Based on our model, we reasoned that <lb/>such genes should be repressed upon EGL-4 activation in a <lb/>SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex dependent manner. In addition to <lb/>Y45F10C.2, which regulates egg laying rate, we also identified a <lb/>group of genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, lipid and <lb/>sugar transport, and extracellular signaling (Figure 5B; YAH, <lb/>LCH and HYM, unpublished data). Our results are consistent <lb/>with the observation that alteration in PKG activity in Drosophila <lb/> also led to changes in lipid and carbohydrate storage and <lb/>metabolism [49]. <lb/>How does EGL-4 regulate egg-laying has been an open question <lb/>since the original isolation of egl-4 mutants almost 30 years ago <lb/>[20]. Although the neuronal circuit that controls egg-laying <lb/>muscles is well-defined [50–52], additional mechanisms have been <lb/>proposed to modulate egg-laying rate in response to environmen-<lb/>tal stimuli. EGL-4 may be involved in the latter since <lb/>pharmacological studies failed to assign a role for EGL-4 in the <lb/>neuronal circuit that controls the egg-laying muscles or at the <lb/>muscles themselves [20]. Here, we provide experimental evidence <lb/>that EGL-4 controls egg-laying, at least in part, by modulating the <lb/>expression of Y45F10C.2, a putative secreted protein from the <lb/>uterine epithelium. The DUF1505 family, to which Y45F10C.2 <lb/>belongs, appears to have undergone expansion through gene <lb/>duplication in C. elegans. However, Y45F10C.2 and its duplicate, <lb/>C08F11.12 are the only family members whose expression is <lb/>regulated by EGL-4 activity (NXU and HYM, unpublished data). <lb/>The molecular target of Y45F10C.2 is unknown. It is plausible <lb/>that Y45F10C.2 can bind to novel cell surface receptors that <lb/>inhibit egg laying or modulate the function of serotonin, <lb/>acetylcholine or neuropeptide receptors at the neuromuscular <lb/>circuit for egg laying. <lb/>Our results support a surprising in vivo role for the mammalian <lb/>orthologs of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2. In cell culture systems, <lb/>TRERF1 has been reported to activate CYP11A1, a gene required <lb/>for steroidogenesis [41]. TRERF1 also interacts with Dnttip1 and <lb/>together, they have been implicated in V(D)J recombination by <lb/>antagonizing the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) [44]. <lb/>Another SAEG-1 ortholog, ZNF541, has been implicated in <lb/>chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis in mice [40]. While <lb/>it is hard to reconcile such diverse functions of TRERF1, ZNF541 <lb/>and Dnttip1, our results implicate that together with HDAC1 or <lb/>HDAC2, TRERF1 and Dnttip1 may constitute a PKG effector <lb/>complex in tissues where they are co-expressed, such as the <lb/>olfactory bulb in mice (Allen Brain Atlas). Notably, EGL-4 is <lb/>known to be required for chemotaxis and olfactory adaptation in <lb/>sensory neurons in C. elegans [21,24]. It is plausible that PKG may <lb/>modulate gene expression in the olfactory bulb via the TRERF1/ <lb/>Dnttip1/HDAC complex upon olfactory stimulation. <lb/>While the intracellular cGMP level is tightly regulated by the <lb/>opposing action of guanylyl cyclase (GC) and phosphodiesterase <lb/>(PDE) physiologically [1,2], NO-releasing organic nitrates and <lb/>PDE inhibitors have been developed to increase cGMP level <lb/>pharmacologically [1]. This is because the NO-cGMP-PKG <lb/>pathway is critical for relaxation of smooth muscles and <lb/>activation of this pathway provides effective therapy for erectile <lb/>dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and potentially other <lb/>diseases associated with abnormal smooth muscle tone. Despite <lb/>the wide spread use of nitrates and PDE inhibitors, little is known <lb/>about the effects of sustained elevation of cGMP level and <lb/>presumably prolonged activation of PKG. Our results suggest <lb/>that the potential genomic effects of PKG activation should be <lb/>considered when administering nitrates and PDE inhibitors. <lb/>Furthermore, the conserved SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone deacety-<lb/>lase complex represents new molecular targets for the develop-<lb/>ment of chemicals that specifically target cytoplasmic versus <lb/>nuclear PKG activity. <lb/>In summary, our results provide a molecular framework on how <lb/>nuclear EGL-4/PKG activity triggers wide-spread physiological <lb/>responses. In C. elegans, we expect to identify additional EGL-4 <lb/>responsive genes that regulate foraging behavior and body length. <lb/>It is plausible that the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone deacetylase <lb/>complex may engage tissue specific transcription factors, which <lb/>may be identified through isolation of tissue specific genetic <lb/>suppressors of the egl-4(gf) mutant. Given the deep conservation of <lb/>EGL-4, SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, our model should be readily <lb/>applicable in mammals and expand the mode of action of cGMP <lb/>signaling and its downstream kinase PKG. <lb/> Figure 3.

Based on annotation of <lb/>the eight genes in this region, we chose to sequence all exons <lb/>and exon/intron junction of egl-4 and identified a single G to T <lb/>mutation that introduced a K162N (residue numbering as in <lb/>EGL-4A) substitution in animals carrying the mg410 allele. <lb/>This mutation is located in a common exon shared by isoforms <lb/>a, b, c, and e of egl-4. <lb/> To isolate genetic suppressors of egl-4(mg410), we mutagenized <lb/> egl-4(mg410) animals with ethyl methane-sulfonate (EMS) by using <lb/>standard procedures. We screened 34,000 haploid genomes and <lb/>retrieved both intragenic and extragenic suppressors of egl-4(mg410), <lb/> which displayed an increase in body length and roaming behavior. <lb/>Intragenic suppressors are egl-4 loss-of-function alleles, including <lb/> hj32, hj33 and hj40. In addition, we isolated extragenic suppressor <lb/>alleles that fell into two complementation groups. Genetic mapping <lb/>with the Hawaiian isolate CB4856 placed saeg-2(hj9) on LGIII <lb/>between snp_F54F2[1] and snp_pkP3051. Cosmid rescue and <lb/>candidate gene sequencing identified a g to a mutation in the splice <lb/>donor site of the third intron in T23G5.6. Expression of SAEG-<lb/>2::GFP under the control of saeg-2 promoter from a single copy <lb/>transgene (hjSi15) also rescued egl-4(mg410); saeg-2(ok3174) animals. <lb/>However, over-expression of SAEG-2::GFP from extra-chromo-<lb/>somal transgenes failed to do so. We mapped saeg-1(hj11) to LGV <lb/>between snp_T21C9[2] and snp_pkP5065. Of the candidate genes <lb/>we sequenced in this interval, we found mutations in F53H10.2 in <lb/> hj11, hj12, hj15 and hj16 and we rescued animals carrying hj12 by <lb/>injecting the fosmid WRM062aH08, which contained only the <lb/>coding and regulatory sequences of F53H10.2. We used hj12 as the <lb/>reference allele, which introduced a pre-mature stop codon in place <lb/>of Arg615 (residue numbering as in SAEG-1A) and an 80% <lb/>decrease in mRNA level as measured by quantitative real-time PCR <lb/>(YAH and HYM, unpublished data). <lb/> Heat-shock experiments <lb/> Heat-shock experiments were performed with synchronized <lb/>wild-type, hjIs28 and hjIs30 young adult animals as judged by <lb/>vulval morphology. Animals were raised at 20uC on NGM agar <lb/>plates seeded with OP50 and were heat shocked for 30 mins at <lb/>33uC, before returning to 20uC for defined periods of time. 50 <lb/>animals were picked at each time point for detection of EGL-4 <lb/>protein by Western blotting. <lb/> Antibodies <lb/> Antibodies against EGL-4 were raised in rabbits using a GST-EGL-<lb/>4A(32-215) fusion protein. EGL-4A(32-215) encompasses the auto-<lb/>inhibition domain, which is also present in EGL-4 isoforms B, C and E. <lb/>Antibodies against SAEG-2 were raised in rabbits using full-length <lb/>SAEG-2 fused to the Pseudomonas Endotoxin at the N-terminus and a <lb/>poly-histidine tag at the C-terminus. Monoclonal antibodies against the <lb/>FLAG epitope (clone M2; Sigma) and HA epitope (clone 3F10; Roche) <lb/>were used for Western blot. For immunoprecipitation, anti-FLAG <lb/>(clone M2; Sigma) and anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma) antibodies <lb/>conjugated to agarose beads were used. <lb/> Cell and worm lysates preparation and <lb/>immunoprecipitation <lb/> Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with copper inducible <lb/>expression plasmids based on pMT-V5-HisB (Invitrogen) using <lb/> Figure 4.

Animals were <lb/>allowed to move freely on a 6 cm NGM plate freshly seeded with <lb/> E. coli OP50 on the entire surface. Movies were taken on a Lumar <lb/>dissecting microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera with a <lb/>field of view of 2.2 cm61.7 cm. Animals that moved out of the <lb/>field were defined as new objects by the Worm Tracker program. <lb/>We assigned an animal as dwelling if it exhibited angular velocity <lb/> $110u/s or # –110u/s, for a duration $30 s. We assigned an <lb/>animal as roaming if it was not engaged in dwelling as described <lb/>above. <lb/>Foraging behavior over 18 hrs was measured as the area of <lb/>bacterial lawn that was explored by a single worm on 6 cm NGM <lb/>plates seeded with E. coli OP50 (,2 cm diameter) at 20uC.
