Ellen van der Schoot, Gestur Vidarsson † <lb/>INTRODUCTION: Antibody function is often con-<lb/>sidered static and mostly determined by isotype <lb/>and subclass. The conserved N-linked glycan <lb/>at position 297 in the Fc domain of immuno-<lb/>globulin G (IgG) is essential for an antibody&apos;s <lb/>effector functions. Moreover, this glycan is <lb/>highly variable and functionally relevant, es-<lb/>pecially for the core fucose moiety. IgG lacking <lb/>core fucosylation (afucosylated IgG) causes <lb/>increased antibody-dependent cellular cyto-<lb/>toxicity (ADCC) through highly increased IgG-<lb/>Fc receptor IIIa (FcgRIIIa) affinity. Despite <lb/>constant levels of total plasma IgG-Fc fucosy-<lb/>lation above 90%, specific IgG responses with <lb/>low core fucosylation have been sporadically <lb/>reported. These are directed against alloanti-<lb/>gens on blood cells and glycoproteins of HIV <lb/>and dengue virus. In this study, we inves-<lb/>tigated the induction of afucosylated IgG to <lb/>various antigens and delineated its dynamics <lb/>and proinflammatory potential in COVID-19. <lb/>RATIONALE: Afucosylated IgG responses have <lb/>only been found in various alloimmune re-<lb/>sponses against cellular blood groups and <lb/>two enveloped viruses. Therefore, we tested <lb/>the hypothesis that foreign surface-exposed, <lb/>membrane-embedded proteins induce a spe-<lb/>cific B cell response that results in afucosylated <lb/>IgG. We compared immune responses to nat-<lb/>ural infections by enveloped viruses and non-<lb/>enveloped viruses, protein subunit vaccination, <lb/>and live attenuated virus vaccinations. We also <lb/>assessed the relation to the clinical outcome of <lb/>such a response in COVID-19. <lb/>RESULTS: Analogous to blood cell alloantigens, <lb/>the response to all enveloped viruses showed <lb/>clear signatures of afucosylation of the antigen-<lb/>specific IgG. By contrast, IgG against the non-<lb/>enveloped virus, parvovirus B19, were highly <lb/>fucosylated. The extent of afucosylated IgG re-<lb/>sponses varied, both between individuals and <lb/>between antigens. The viral context was essen-<lb/>tial to induce afucosylated IgG because induc-<lb/>tion did not occur after subunit vaccination <lb/>against hepatitis B virus. However, afucosylated <lb/>IgG responses were found in response to atten-<lb/>uated viruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome <lb/>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific afucosylated <lb/>IgG were also found in critically ill COVID-19 <lb/>patients but not in individuals with mild symp-<lb/>toms. Over the 2 weeks after seroconversion, the <lb/>amount of fucosylated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG <lb/>increased markedly, in most reaching relative <lb/>levels similar to those found in total IgG. <lb/>Afucosylated IgG promoted interleukin-6 (IL-6) <lb/>release in macrophages cultured in vitro, which <lb/>is in line with an observed association of SARS-<lb/>CoV-2-specific IgG afucosylation with IL-6 and <lb/>C-reactive protein (CRP) in these patients. <lb/>CONCLUSION: This work suggests that provid-<lb/>ing foreign B cell antigens in the context of host <lb/>cells may be required to trigger an afucosylated <lb/>IgG immune response. The strength of this re-<lb/>sponse is highly variable for different antigens <lb/>and between individuals. An afucosylated IgG <lb/>response is a potent immune response, honed <lb/>for the destruction of target cells by FcgRIII-<lb/>expressing natural killer (NK) and myeloid <lb/>cells. This may sometimes be desirable-for ex-<lb/>ample, against HIV-and can be achieved in <lb/>vaccines by providing the target as a surface <lb/>protein, as is the case with attenuated viral <lb/>vaccines or mRNA vaccines. However, for SARS-<lb/>CoV-2, this afucosylated IgG response may <lb/>promote the exacerbation of COVID-19 under <lb/>conditions with high viral loads at the time of <lb/>seroconversion. ▪ <lb/>RESEARCH <lb/>Larsen et al., Science 371, 907 (2021) <lb/>26 February 2021 <lb/>1 of 1 <lb/>The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online. <lb/>*These authors contributed equally to this work. <lb/> †Corresponding author.

A highly <lb/>conserved N-linked glycan within the IgG-Fc tail, which is essential for IgG function, shows variable <lb/>composition in humans. Afucosylated IgG variants are already used in anticancer therapeutic antibodies <lb/>for their increased activity through Fc receptors (FcgRIIIa). Here, we report that afucosylated IgG <lb/>(approximately 6% of total IgG in humans) are specifically formed against enveloped viruses but <lb/>generally not against other antigens. This mediates stronger FcgRIIIa responses but also amplifies <lb/>brewing cytokine storms and immune-mediated pathologies. Critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not <lb/>those with mild symptoms, had high concentrations of afucosylated IgG antibodies against severe acute <lb/>respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), amplifying proinflammatory cytokine release and <lb/>acute phase responses. Thus, antibody glycosylation plays a critical role in immune responses to <lb/>enveloped viruses, including COVID-19. <lb/></front>

			<body>A <lb/>ntibody function has long been con-<lb/>sidered static and mostly determined by <lb/>their isotype and subclass. The presence <lb/>of a conserved N-linked glycan at posi-<lb/>tion 297 in the Fc domain of immuno-<lb/>globulin G (IgG) is essential for its effector <lb/>functions (1-3). Moreover, the composition <lb/>of this glycan is highly variable, which has <lb/>functional consequences (2-4). This is espe-<lb/>cially true for the core fucose attached to the <lb/>Fc glycan. The discovery that IgG variants with-<lb/>out core fucosylation cause elevated antibody-<lb/>dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), through <lb/>increased IgG-Fc receptor IIIa (FcgRIIIa) affinity <lb/>(5, 6), has resulted in next-generation glyco-<lb/>engineered monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that <lb/>lack core fucosylation for targeting tumors (7). <lb/>Generally, changes in the Fc glycans are <lb/>associated with age, sex, and autoimmune <lb/>diseases and are most pronounced for IgG-Fc <lb/>galactosylation, which decreases steadily with <lb/>advancing age. After a marked elevation in <lb/>young women, IgG-Fc galactosylation decreases <lb/>during menopause to the levels seen in men <lb/>(8). IgG-Fc fucosylation is more stable, decreas-<lb/>ing slightly from birth to ~94% at adulthood <lb/>(9), after which it remains fairly constant, <lb/>albeit with a minor reduction throughout <lb/>life (8, 10). <lb/>Despite the apparent constant level of Fc <lb/>fucosylation during adulthood, alloantibodies <lb/>against red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets <lb/>show low IgG-Fc fucosylation in most patients, <lb/>even down to 10% in several cases (11-13). By <lb/>contrast, overall serum IgG-Fc fucosylation is <lb/>consistently high. Moreover, lowered IgG-Fc <lb/>fucosylation is one of the factors that deter-<lb/>mine disease severity in pregnancy-associated <lb/>alloimmunizations, resulting in excessive throm-<lb/>bocytopenia and RBC destruction when targeted <lb/>by afucosylated antibodies (12-14). In addition <lb/>to the specific afucosylated IgG response against <lb/>platelets and RBC antigens, this response has <lb/>only been identified against human immuno-<lb/>deficiency virus (HIV) and dengue virus (15, 16). <lb/>Low core fucosylation of anti-HIV antibodies <lb/>has been suggested to be a feature of elite <lb/>controllers of infection, whereas for dengue, <lb/>it has been associated with enhanced pathol-<lb/>ogy owing to excessive FcgRIIIa activation <lb/>(15, 16). The mechanisms that control IgG <lb/>core fucosylation remain unclear, however. <lb/>Similar afucosylated IgG are found in var-<lb/>ious alloimmune responses (11-13, 17), HIV <lb/>(16), and dengue (15), which are all directed <lb/>against surface-exposed, membrane-embedded <lb/>proteins. Therefore, we analyzed IgG glycosyl-<lb/>ation in antihuman platelet responses and in <lb/>natural infections by enveloped viruses, includ-<lb/>ing HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), measles virus, <lb/>mumps virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and <lb/>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus <lb/>2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also assessed responses to <lb/>a nonenveloped virus (parvovirus B19), vacci-<lb/>nation with a HBV-protein subunit, and live <lb/>attenuated enveloped viruses to test whether <lb/>the antigen context was an important deter-<lb/>minant for IgG-Fc glycosylation. <lb/>Afucosylated IgG is formed against <lb/>enveloped viruses <lb/>IgG-Fc glycosylation of affinity-purified total <lb/>and antigen-specific antibodies were made pos-<lb/>sible with tandem liquid chromatography-<lb/>mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Fig. 1 and fig. S1) <lb/>(12, 17, 18). Fc fucosylation of antigen-specific <lb/>antibodies against the alloantigen human <lb/>platelet antigen 1a (HPA-1a) were substantially <lb/>reduced (Fig. 2A) (14), which is similar to pre-<lb/>vious findings for other alloantigens (12, 17). <lb/>Analogous to platelet and RBC alloantigens <lb/>(11-13, 17), the response to the enveloped vi-<lb/>ruses CMV and HIV also showed significant <lb/>afucosylation of the antigen-specific IgG (Fig. <lb/>2B). By contrast, IgG against the nonenveloped <lb/>virus parvovirus B19 were fucosylated (Fig. 2C). <lb/>The total IgG showed high fucosylation levels <lb/>throughout (Fig. 2, A to C), reaffirming pre-<lb/>vious findings that the majority of IgG re-<lb/>sponses result in fucosylated IgG (12, 18, 19). <lb/>The extent of afucosylated IgG responses to the <lb/>enveloped viruses was highly variable, both <lb/>between individuals and between the types <lb/>of antigen, which is similar to observations of <lb/>immune responses to different RBC alloanti-<lb/>gens (17). Afucosylation was particularly strong <lb/>for CMV and less pronounced for HIV (Fig. 2B), <lb/>confirming previous observations in HIV (16). <lb/>Afucosylated IgG responses were often accom-<lb/>panied by increased galactosylation (fig. S2). <lb/>To test whether some individuals had a <lb/>greater intrinsic capacity to generate an afuco-<lb/>sylated IgG response than others, we compared <lb/></body>

			<body>IgG1-Fc fucosylation levels against two different <lb/>antigens within the same individual. No cor-<lb/>relation was observed when comparing the <lb/>level of afucosylation between two different <lb/>antigens within the same individual, neither <lb/>for anti-HPA-1a and anti-CMV (fig. S3A) nor for <lb/>anti-HIV and anti-CMV antibodies (fig. S3B). <lb/>Thus, the level of afucosylation is not prede-<lb/>termined by general host factors such as <lb/>genetics but is rather stochastic or multi-<lb/>factorial, with the specific triggers remain-<lb/>ing obscure. <lb/>Afucosylated IgG is generated against <lb/>attenuated enveloped viral vaccines <lb/>To further investigate the immunological <lb/>context by which potent afucosylated IgG is <lb/>formed, we compared immune responses to <lb/>identical viral antigens in different contexts. <lb/>First, we compared hepatitis B surface anti-<lb/>gen (HBsAg)-specific antibody glycosylation <lb/>in humans naturally infected with HBV or <lb/>vaccinated with the recombinant HBsAg <lb/>protein (Fig. 2D). Total IgG1-Fc fucosyla-<lb/>tion levels were similar for the two groups, <lb/>whereas anti-HBsAg IgG1-Fc fucosylation <lb/>was elevated in individuals vaccinated with <lb/>the HBsAg protein when compared with <lb/>either total IgG-or antigen-specific IgG-Fc <lb/>fucosylation of the naturally infected group <lb/>(Fig. 2D). Thus, HBsAg-specific antibodies <lb/>in individuals who cleared a natural infec-<lb/>tion show lowered Fc fucosylation compared <lb/>with that in individuals who received protein <lb/>subunit vaccination. This strongly suggests <lb/>that a specific context for the antigenic <lb/>stimulus is required for afucosylated IgG <lb/>responses. <lb/>We then compared antiviral IgG responses <lb/>against mumps and measles viruses formed <lb/>after a natural infection or vaccination with <lb/>live attenuated viruses. Unlike the HBV pro-<lb/>tein subunit vaccine, both live attenuated <lb/>vaccines showed a similar antigen-specific Fc <lb/>fucosylation compared with their natural in-<lb/>fection counterpart (Fig. 2E and fig. S4). The <lb/>tendency to generate afucosylated IgG was <lb/>weak for measles, whereas the mumps re-<lb/>sponse showed clear signs of afucosylation <lb/>by either route of immunization (Fig. 2E and <lb/>figs. S4 and S5). <lb/></body>

			<body>Afucosylated IgG is found in critically ill <lb/>COVID-19 patients <lb/>We then tested whether this type of response <lb/>also plays a role in patients with COVID-19. <lb/>Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly diverse, <lb/>ranging from asymptomatic or mild self-limiting <lb/>infection to a severe airway inflammation that <lb/>leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome <lb/>(ARDS), often with a fatal outcome (20, 21). <lb/>Both extreme trajectories follow similar initial <lb/>responses: Patients have approximately a week <lb/>of relatively mild symptoms, followed by a <lb/>second wave that either resolves the disease <lb/>or leads to a highly aggravated life-threatening <lb/>phenotype (20, 21). Both the timing of either <lb/>response type and the differential clinical out-<lb/>come suggested different routes taken by the <lb/>immune system to combat the disease. So far, <lb/>no clear evidence has emerged that can dis-<lb/>tinguish between these two hypothetical im-<lb/>munological paths. In accordance with our <lb/>hypothesis and responses observed against <lb/>other enveloped viruses, anti-S IgG responses <lb/>against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), which <lb/>is expressed on the cell surface and the viral <lb/>envelope, were strongly skewed toward low <lb/>levels of core fucosylation. By contrast, re-<lb/>sponses against the nucleocapsid protein (N), <lb/>which is not expressed on the cell surface or <lb/>viral envelope, were characterized by high lev-<lb/>els of fucosylation (Fig. 3A). The IgG response <lb/>appeared to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>because there was very weak or absent reactivity <lb/>to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in pre-outbreak sam-<lb/>ples, even to the more conserved N antigen (fig. <lb/>S6) (22). The anti-S IgG1 responses of patients <lb/>with ARDS recently (&lt;5 days) hospitalized in <lb/>intensive care units (ICUs) were significantly <lb/>less fucosylated than in convalescent plasma <lb/>donors consisting of individuals who were <lb/>asymptomatic or had relative mild symptoms <lb/>(non-ARDS) (Fig. 3A). <lb/>These decreased levels of Fc fucosylation of <lb/>anti-S IgG were not a result of inflammation <lb/>because total IgG-Fc fucosylation levels were <lb/>similar between the two groups and to what <lb/>has been reported in the general population <lb/>(~94%) (12, 18). In addition, IgG1-Fc galacto-<lb/>sylation and sialylation of both anti-S and <lb/>anti-N responses (Fig. 3, B and C) were sig-<lb/>nificantly increased compared with total IgG, <lb/>which is consistent with reports describing <lb/>increased Fc galactosylation and sialylation <lb/>in active or recent immunization (18, 23). <lb/>Total IgG1-Fc galactosylation and sialylation <lb/>levels were significantly lowered in the ARDS <lb/>patients, which was perhaps a reflection of a <lb/>slight age difference between these two groups <lb/>[non-ARDS donors median age (IQR) 49 (40 to <lb/>55) years versus ARDS patients 60 (55-63) <lb/>years (tables S1 and S2)]. Both Fc galactosy-<lb/>lation and sialylation decrease with age (9, 19). <lb/>Increased galactosylation and sialylation of <lb/>antigen-specific IgG1-Fc increases complement <lb/>activity by approximately three-to fourfold. Fc <lb/>galactosylation further enhances affinity of <lb/>afucosylated IgG to FcgRIII by approximately <lb/>twofold (24). Last, although Fc bisection was <lb/>significantly lowered in both anti-N and anti-<lb/>S responses (Fig. 3D), the biological and clinical <lb/>relevance of this is limited because IgG-Fc <lb/>bisection affects neither Fc receptor nor com-<lb/>plement activity (24). Further, accumulating <lb/>evidence strongly suggests that the primary <lb/>and major biologically relevant change in IgG-<lb/>Fc glycosylation is the lack of core fucose. <lb/>Afucosylated IgG have a 20-to 40-fold increase <lb/>in affinity to FcgRIIIa, which is often accom-<lb/>panied by an absolute change from no cellular <lb/>response to strong phagocytic and ADCC re-<lb/>sponses upon afucosylation (5, 15, 24, 25). The <lb/>lowered Fc fucosylation in the anti-S responses <lb/>of the ARDS patients suggests a pathological <lb/>role through FcgRIIIa, similar to what has <lb/>previously been proposed for dengue (15). In <lb/>dengue, non-neutralizing antibodies that were <lb/>formed to previous infections of other dengue <lb/>serotypes also tend to have low amounts of <lb/>core-fucosylated IgG. Because they are incapable <lb/>of preventing infection, they lead to aggravated <lb/>dengue hemorrhagic fever because of FcgRIIIa-<lb/>mediated overreactions by immune cells (15). <lb/></body>

			<body>Fucosylation levels of anti-S are lowest <lb/>at seroconversion <lb/>ARDS patients were sampled within 1 week <lb/>after ICU admission, and non-ARDS patients <lb/>were convalescent nonhospitalized individuals. <lb/>In order to eliminate any possible sampling <lb/>bias in the observed IgG-Fc glycosylation pat-<lb/>terns over time, we also analyzed longitudinal <lb/>samples from both groups (26). Alloantibody <lb/>Fc fucosylation to platelets and RBC antigens <lb/>is stable for at least a decade with or without a <lb/>natural booster through pregnancies (12, 14) <lb/>or blood transfusion (27). This also held true <lb/>for anti-CMV and anti-HIV responses (fig. S7). <lb/>By contrast, changes in all glycosylation traits <lb/>were already observed for SARS-CoV-2 during <lb/>the first week after ICU admission (Fig. 3, E <lb/>to L, and figs. S8 and S9). These observed <lb/>changes in Fc galactosylation (fig. S8) were in <lb/>line with previous reports that recent immu-<lb/>nizations are accompanied with a transient <lb/>rise in antigen-specific IgG-Fc galactosylation <lb/>and sialylation (18, 23). After seroconversion, <lb/>all ARDS patients initially showed low levels <lb/>of anti-S IgG fucosylation compared with non-<lb/>ARDS patients. Fucosylation levels rose over <lb/>time in ARDS patients, reaching levels com-<lb/>parable with those of the non-ARDS cohort <lb/>(Fig. 3, E and G). The increases in fucose <lb/>levels were associated with simultaneous <lb/>rises in IgG levels (Fig. 3, E to H, and fig. S10, A <lb/>and B), which were much less pronounced in <lb/>the non-ARDS cohort. Similar kinetics were <lb/>observed for anti-N IgG numbers (Fig. 3, J and <lb/>L). Reduced levels of anti-N Fc fucosylation <lb/>were also present in the ARDS group, although <lb/>to a lesser degree than for anti-S (Fig. 3, I and <lb/>K, and fig. S11). This unexpected reduction in <lb/>the fucosylation of anti-N IgG seen in the ARDS <lb/>cohort may have been the result of classical <lb/>bystander effects (28). Namely, B cells prolifer-<lb/>ating in the same lymphoid organs receive sim-<lb/>ilar environmental cues from antigen-presenting <lb/>cells and T cells. The IgG1-Fc fucosylation of <lb/>anti-S and anti-N correlated significantly (Fig. <lb/>3M) with higher levels of afucosylation for <lb/>anti-S (P &lt; 0.0001). Significant correlations were <lb/>also observed for other glycosylation traits, <lb/>with similar skewing for both anti-S and <lb/>anti-N IgG (fig. S12). These elevations in <lb/>antigen-specific IgG1-Fc galactosylation <lb/>and sialylation agreed with earlier reports <lb/>that have suggested that these are general <lb/>features of newly formed ongoing immune <lb/>responses (18, 23). Total IgG1-Fc fucosylation <lb/>remained stable throughout the observation <lb/>period (figs. S8J and S9J). <lb/>Afucosylated IgG contributes to inflammation <lb/>in COVID-19 <lb/>We then asked how these afucosylated anti-<lb/>SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might contribute to <lb/>the strong inflammatory response observed <lb/>in ARDS patients. Alveolar macrophages are <lb/>front-line scavengers in the lung and express <lb/>FcgRIIIa, the major myeloid sensory receptor <lb/>for afucosylated IgG. Thus, we examined their <lb/>potential to stimulate the production of the <lb/>pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), <lb/>the cytokine that is most critical for acute-phase <lb/>responses in humans (29). Afucosylated IgG, <lb/>together with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand, <lb/>enhanced IL-6 production from macrophages <lb/>in vitro, particularly when using afucosylated <lb/>and highly galactosylated IgG, as is found prom-<lb/>inently in the ARDS patients (Fig. 3N and <lb/>figs. S8 and S13). There was a significant cor-<lb/>relation between anti-S IgG1-Fc fucosylation <lb/>and both plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein <lb/>(CRP) concentrations (Fig. 3, O and P). This <lb/>agrees with our hypothesis that afucosylated <lb/>anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG plays a substantial role <lb/>in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Concentrations of <lb/>plasma IL-6 and CRP increased around the <lb/>time when afucosylated anti-S IgG appeared, <lb/>which suggested a direct causality (Fig. 4, A <lb/>and B). Plasma D-dimer levels also shared this <lb/>temporal pattern (fig. S14). Thus, the afucosy-<lb/>lated and highly galactosylated anti-S and <lb/>anti-N IgG in some patients may cause an <lb/>exaggerated release of proinflammatory cyto-<lb/>kines and subsequent systemic inflammation <lb/>because of their enhanced binding capacity to <lb/>FcgRIIIa (24) on alveolar macrophages. No <lb/>increase of either IL-6 or CRP was observed <lb/>in the non-ARDS cases (Fig. 4, C and D, and <lb/>fig. S15). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our results show a pattern of afucosylated <lb/>IgG1 immune responses against membrane-<lb/>embedded antigens such as surface membrane <lb/>proteins of alloantigens on blood cells or <lb/>on enveloped viruses (including attenuated <lb/>enveloped virus vaccines that often complete <lb/>their first round of infection). This contrasts <lb/>with soluble protein antigens and nonenvel-<lb/>oped viruses for which immune responses <lb/>with high levels of IgG1-Fc fucosylation were <lb/>consistently observed. Although there was <lb/>afucosylated anti-N IgG in COVID-19 patients, <lb/>this was no longer the case 1 to 2 weeks after <lb/>seroconversion. <lb/>We hypothesize that antigen-presenting <lb/>membranes are directly sensed by B cells <lb/>by combining at least two signals provided <lb/>by the B cell receptor and undescribed host <lb/>receptor-ligand pair(s). This two-step mecha-<lb/>nism would be essential for the production of <lb/>long-lasting afucosylated IgG responses and <lb/>would not be triggered by soluble proteins, <lb/>internal proteins of enveloped viruses, or non-<lb/>enveloped viruses (Fig. 5). Alternatively, dif-<lb/>ferential antigen recognition may be more <lb/>complex and require additional interactions <lb/>from antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and/or <lb/>cytokines. This notion is supported by anti-N <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 responses occurring concomi-<lb/>tantly with anti-S responses, which suggests <lb/>that proximal factors in the lymphoid micro-<lb/>environment can influence the response. <lb/>This work suggests that providing foreign <lb/>B cell antigens in the context of the host-cell <lb/>membrane may be necessary but not sufficient <lb/>to trigger an immune response with high <lb/>amounts of long-lasting afucosylated IgG <lb/>(17). This translates into varied Fc fucosyla-<lb/>tion levels between individuals as well as <lb/>for distinct responses of the same individ-<lb/>ual against different antigens. The large dif-<lb/>ference in the number of antigen-specific <lb/>afucosylated responses observed between <lb/>patients contributes to the variability of dis-<lb/>ease severity, as has been shown for neonatal <lb/>alloimmune cytopenias (12, 13, 17) and dengue <lb/>(15). Here, we also show its importance for the <lb/>pathogenesis of COVID-19. Thus, afucosylation <lb/>may potentially help predict disease trajecto-<lb/>ries and guide future treatments aimed at <lb/>minimizing this FcgRIIIa stimulus. <lb/>IgG-Fc afucosylation results in potent im-<lb/>mune responses. Namely, FcgRIIIa-expressing <lb/>natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and mac-<lb/>rophages as well as FcgRIIIb-expressing gran-<lb/>ulocytes are triggered to destroy target cells. <lb/>This response may be desirable in some re-<lb/>sponses, such as against HIV (16), and can be <lb/>achieved with available attenuated enveloped <lb/>viral vaccine shuttles (30) against targets for <lb/>which vaccine-based approaches have failed. <lb/>However, this phenomenon can also lead to an <lb/>undesirable exaggerated response, as is the <lb/>case for both dengue virus (15) and SARS-CoV-2. <lb/>Attenuated virus vaccine ferrying spike proteins <lb/>of SARS-CoV are known to produce strong <lb/>antibody-dependent enhanced responses (31) <lb/>mimicking pathologies in critically ill SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 patients (21). This suggests that subunit <lb/>protein vaccines may be a safer option, as seen <lb/>in rat models for SARS-CoV-2 (32), unless the <lb/>vaccine also induces a strong neutralizing effect <lb/>that can contribute to enhanced protection. <lb/>The afucosylation of anti-S IgG may con-<lb/>tribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19 in a <lb/>subset of patients, resulting in ARDS. Thus, <lb/>although they can be protective, antibodies <lb/>potentially behave as double-edged swords and <lb/>may contribute to the observed cytokine storm <lb/>(33). As such, this has direct consequences for <lb/>the development of improved intravenous <lb/>Ig (IVIg), convalescent plasma, and vaccine <lb/>therapies. In addition, the suggested role of <lb/>afucosylated antibodies in the pathogenesis <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2 may open up additional op-<lb/>portunities for the treatment of COVID-19. <lb/>Thus, attempts to generate high-titer Ig treat-<lb/>ments should preferably use plasma enriched <lb/>in fucosylated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. <lb/>This may avoid the escalation of symptoms <lb/>and promote virus neutralization in patients, <lb/>preferentially before developing afucosylated <lb/>IgG responses. <lb/></body>

			<body>A <lb/>B <lb/>C <lb/>Fig. 5. Hypothetical model explaining how different antigen contexts could produce altered immune <lb/>signaling that gives rise to altered IgG glycosylation. (A) Immune responses to soluble protein antigen: <lb/>B cell receptor (BCR; a membrane Ig) is activated, resulting in the production of normal fucosylated <lb/>antibodies. (B) For immune responses to alloantigens, paternal alloantigens on a red blood cell (RBC) are <lb/>recognized by the BCR and possibly by other undescribed immune regulatory receptor-ligand pair(s) that <lb/>provide a signal for recognition of self. (C) For immune responses to enveloped viral infection and <lb/>attenuated viruses, the recognition of enveloped virus-infected by B cells would be similar as for the <lb/>recognition of cellular alloantigens (B). The initial recognition may potentially occur toward enveloped <lb/>virus-infected cells and/or after viral assembly (far right). The proposed signaling in (B) and (C) causes <lb/>altered glyco-programming of the B cells, culminating in a distinct IgG response characterized by a low <lb/>Fc fucosylation (red triangle, fucose) and enhanced ADCC. This model potentially explains both why <lb/>immune responses to soluble proteins, nonenveloped viruses, and cellular pathogens such as bacteria are <lb/>different from responses to enveloped viruses (and attenuated viruses). Furthermore, it may explain <lb/>why immune responses to alloantigens immunologically resemble those of enveloped viral infections. <lb/></body>

Both proteins <lb/>were produced as previously described (26). <lb/>After washing, 0.5 mg/ml of HRP-conjugated <lb/>anti-human IgG (MH16-1, Sanquin) was added <lb/>in PTG and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Fol-<lb/>lowing enzymatic conversion of TMB substrate, <lb/>absorbance was measured at 450 nm and <lb/>540 nm. Antibody binding was evaluated <lb/>by comparison to a reference plasma pool <lb/>of convalescent COVID-19 patients set at <lb/>100 AU/ml. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Statistical analyses were performed using <lb/>GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.2) for Windows <lb/>(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA; www. <lb/>graphpad.com). To analyze whether Fc-<lb/>fucosylation for total and antigen-specific <lb/>IgG differs between the tested cohorts, statis-<lb/>tical analysis was performed using two-way <lb/>analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired <lb/>t tests as specified for the individual cohorts. <lb/>The same tests were used for comparing cyto-<lb/>kine release from stimulated macrophages. <lb/>To investigate whether Fc-fucosylation pro-<lb/>files of two specific antibodies in the same <lb/>individual were correlated, statistical analysis <lb/>was performed using a Pearson&apos;s correlation. <lb/>A Pearson&apos;s correlation was also used to test <lb/>the correlation between Fc-fucosylation of <lb/>anti-S and anti-N IgG. To test correlations be-<lb/>tween cytokine release and IgG Fc-fucosylation, <lb/>as well as between the degree of anti-S Fc <lb/>fucosylation and CRP levels, a Spearman&apos;s <lb/>correlation was performed. Only statisti-<lb/>cally significant differences are shown; *P &lt; <lb/>0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, ****P &lt; 0.0001. <lb/></body>
