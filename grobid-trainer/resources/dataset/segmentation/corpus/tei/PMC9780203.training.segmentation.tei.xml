Salem 1* , Marian N. Gerges 1 &amp; Ahmed A. Noser 2 <lb/>In the present investigation, derivatives from (2-6) containing pyrimidine-2-thione moiety <lb/>incorporated with different heterocycles such as pyrazoline, phenyl pyrazoline, and pyrimidine were <lb/>synthesized using different methods. These pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives were evaluated in-silico <lb/>for their capability to inhibit the H-RAS-GTP active form protein with insight to their pharmacokinetics <lb/>properties. According to our findings, compound 5a was selected for in vitro studies as it has the <lb/>in-silico top-ranked binding energy. Furthermore, compound 5a induced apoptosis to panels of cancer <lb/>cell lines with the best IC 50 on MCF-7 breast cancer cells (2.617 ± 1.6 µM). This effect was associated <lb/>with the inhibition of phosphorylated RAS, JNK proteins, and PI3K/Akt genes expression. Thus, <lb/>compound 5a has upregulated p21 gene and p53 protein levels. Moreover, 5a arrested the cell cycle <lb/>progression at the sub-G0/G1 phase. In conclusion, the synthesized compound, 5a exhibited potent <lb/>antineoplastic activity against breast cancer cell growth by targeting RAS/ PI3K/Akt/ JNK signaling <lb/>cascades. <lb/></front>

			<body>Breast cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer and the second-leading cause of mortality among women <lb/>worldwide. Currently, the backbone of therapy for breast cancer is mainly chemotherapy, however, the majority <lb/>of its chemotherapeutic medications are associated with toxicity in normal cells and drug resistance. Therefore, <lb/>there is an urgent need for the development of effective, and pharmacologically safe antineoplastic agents to <lb/>treat breast cancer 1 . <lb/>The pyrimidinone ring is central in novel drugs because is it known to exhibit diverse biological activities such <lb/>as antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities 2-5 . Chalcones is also known for its wide range <lb/>of biological properties, including anticancer activities. These substances are also very interesting because they <lb/>can be used to create a variety of biologically active heterocycles, including azepines, pyrazolines, and flavones 6 . <lb/>Pyrazoles are an extremely important scaffold for numerous anticancer agents. The presence of the pyrazole <lb/>moiety in several biologically active drugs has enabled the preparation of novel pyrazoline derivatives that can <lb/>be used as anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antimalarial, and antiviral 7,8 . Here, we will focus on their <lb/>anticancer activity. <lb/>The α, β-unsaturated ketones facile the synthesis of pyrimidinone derivatives through the reaction with urea <lb/>or thiourea 9-12 and pyrazoline derivatives through the reaction with hydrazine and its derivatives 13,14 . <lb/>The progression of cancer is often accompanied by the abnormality of several signaling pathways. Abnor-<lb/>malities in pro-survival, apoptotic, and cell regulatory pathways have become increasingly important in the <lb/>pathogenesis of breast carcinogenesis 15 . Targeting these pathways with pharmacologically safe agents has been <lb/>considered an appealing cancer prevention and treatment approach. <lb/></body>

			<body>The RAS family members like H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS are tiny guanosine triphosphatases <lb/>(GTPases) which are the first human oncogenes that control a range of biological responses 16 . RAS proteins <lb/>transmit extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic signaling network via tyrosine kinase receptors then to the <lb/>nucleus which in turn promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and death. The <lb/>hyperactive RAS signaling contributes significantly to breast cancer&apos;s growth, progression, and metastasis which <lb/>is also linked to breast cancer patients&apos; lower survival rates 17 . Thus, the effective control of oncogenic RAS is a <lb/>therapeutic strategy in breast cancer 18 . <lb/>Moreover, RAS effector families have been associated with the initiation and maintenance of cancer. There-<lb/>fore, it is anticipated that the inhibition of downstream proteins within these pathways could be a successful <lb/>strategy for preventing RAS-mediated oncogenesis. One of the main targets of the RAS effector signaling is the <lb/>RAS/PI3K/Akt pathway 19 . <lb/>PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of Akt 20 . Akt <lb/>(protein kinase B (PKB)) is a serine-threonine protein kinase with oncogenic and antiapoptotic properties 21 . In <lb/>breast cancer, the elevated expression of Akt causes normal breast cells to become neoplasm cells via the dysregu-<lb/>lation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21 22 , and inactivation or mutant to tumor suppressor, <lb/>p53 protein so that the replication of abnormal DNA is not stopped 23 . <lb/>Moreover, RAS activates the protein kinase, JNK which is known to regulate numerous physiological pro-<lb/>cesses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. The JNK kinase family includes three <lb/>proteins, namely, JNK1, JNK2 which are expressed in most tissues, and JNK3, which is expressed in the tissues of <lb/>the brain, heart, and testes. JNK phosphorylates the transcription factor, c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 and these sites <lb/>have been demonstrated to be crucial for the induction of c-Jun activity and cooperation with RAS in oncogenic <lb/>transformation. Considering that the JNK pathway has been associated with cancer progression, RAS regulation <lb/>of JNK activity may have important implications for cancer biology 24 . <lb/>In the present study, we synthesized pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives to clarify the underlying mechanisms <lb/>in-silico and in-vitro by modulating the RAS/PI3K/Akt/JNK signaling pathways. This illuminates the idea of <lb/>creating RAS protein inhibitors and offers a possible path as a future treatment against breast cancer. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Chemistry.

The solid precipitate of the desired product was filtered off and dried under vacuum conditions. <lb/>Simulation studies using molecular docking. The binding of the newly synthesized pyrimidine-<lb/>2-thione derivatives to the target protein H-RAS GTP-active form (PDB # 5P21) was examined using molecular <lb/>docking stimulators. The target protein crystal structure that has been deposited and available through world-<lb/>wide protein data bank link (https:// www. rcsb. org/ struc ture/ 5P21) was downloaded, then rectified and opti-<lb/>mized by eliminating co-crystallized ligand and undesired water molecules, followed by energy minimization. <lb/>Additionally, Chemdraw Ultra 8.0 (https:// en. freed ownlo adman ager. org/ users-choice/ Chemd raw_ Ultra_8. 0. <lb/>html) was used to create the two-dimensional (2D) structures of the prepared analogs. These structures were <lb/>later translated to motif files as three-dimensional (3D). The interaction between the target protein and ligands <lb/>was examined using Molegro Virtual Docker (http:// molex us. io/ moleg ro-virtu al-docker/). The Discovery Stu-<lb/>dio 3.5 tool application (https:// disco ver. 3ds. com/ disco very-studio-visua lizer-downl oad) was used to display <lb/>the intermolecular interactions between the newly synthesized pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives and the target <lb/>protein 27-30 . <lb/>ADMET in-silico prediction.

The culture medium was taken out after 48 h of <lb/>incubation, and the cells were given two gentle washes with 1× ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The <lb/>MTT (10×) has been diluted to a 1× solution in the culture medium (1 volume 10× MTT in 9 volumes medium) <lb/>and 200 μl was added to each well. The microplate has been kept in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 4 h. Af-<lb/>terthat, 180 μl of the MTT solution was taken out and 100 μl of DMSO was put to each well. The microplate was <lb/>incubated for 15 min with shaking at room temperature. The absorbance of each well was ultimately measured <lb/>at 630 nm using a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) 33 . <lb/>Cell morphology. In a six-well plate, 1 × 10 5 MCF-7 cells were seeded and incubated for 24 h then treated with <lb/>the IC 50 dose of the selected compound. Using an inverted light microscope (Olympus, USA), the morphological <lb/>alterations of the treated and untreated cells were evaluated and documented after 48 h of incubation 34 . <lb/>Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Using flow cytometry, cell cycle analysis was carried out via a documented <lb/>method of 35 with a few changes. After trypsinization, the MCF-7 cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min, <lb/>followed by two washings, resuspension in 1× PBS, fixation with ice-cold absolute ethanol, and incubation at <lb/>20 °C for 24 h. Following two PBS washes, the cells were then resuspended in (0.05 mg/mL) propidium iodide <lb/>(PI) 32 solution containing 50 µL (0.2 mg/mL) of RNase A, and 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS. Then, the cells were <lb/>incubated at room temperature for 30-60 min in the dark. Finally, the pellet was washed with 1⤫ PBS and resus-<lb/>pended in 300 µL 1× PBS, and subjected to analysis on Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin <lb/>Lake, BD, USA) equipped with PE X FL2 channels 33 . <lb/></body>

			<body>A drug candidate must first pass a toxicity risk assessment to be considered for drug development. Low toxic-<lb/>ity and side effects are indicative of a medicine&apos;s high therapeutic index. Due to this, an in-silico toxicity analysis <lb/>was carried out, with the outcomes displayed in Table 4. Surprisingly, none of the substances proved carcinogenic. <lb/>Additionally, an AMES toxicity analysis was conducted, and all compounds (3a-6b) tested negative, indicat-<lb/>ing that they have no mutagenic effects. Computed LD 50 levels in the oral rat acute toxicity models have been <lb/>calculated for further investigation of the in-vivo anticancer activities, and the compounds appear to be quite <lb/>safe (2.42-2.76 mol/kg) 41 . <lb/>According to the previous results, the best-docked molecule 5a that impact a great inhibition to H-RAS, GTP <lb/>active form target protein also, showed perfect in-silico physio-chemical, pharmacokinetic and bioavailability <lb/>without any toxicity and carcinogenicity could be a potential new anticancer drug candidate. <lb/>In vitro studies. Growth inhibition of different human cancer cell lines by compound 5a. In the present <lb/>study, the cytotoxic effect of the synthesized compound 5a, and the chemotherapeutic drug, DOX was revealed <lb/>by MTT assay on different human cancer cell lines including breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), colorectal <lb/>(Caco-2), and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancer cells as well as normal cells (WISH). Compound 5a caused dose-de-<lb/>pendent suppression of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Caco-2, and PANC-1 cancer cell proliferation with IC 50 values of <lb/>2.617 ± 1.6, 6.778 ± 2.2, 14.8 ± 2.5 and 23.58 ± 2.4 µM respectively (Fig. 5A). According to our finding, compound <lb/>5a exhibited the lowest IC 50 value against MCF-7 cells indicating that they were more sensitive to this compound <lb/>than other malignant cell lines compared with the cytotoxic effect of DOX that exhibited an IC 50 value equal <lb/>to 2.261 ± 1.4 µM (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, compound 5a exhibited less cytotoxicity to the normal cell line <lb/>with an IC 50 of 180.5 ± 2.7 µM in comparison with cancer cell lines, which proved its safety on normal cells. <lb/>Contrarily, DOX showed a significant toxic effect against normal cells with an IC 50 of 24.49 ± 2.1 µM. Therefore, <lb/>we extended our study using the MCF-7 cells. <lb/>Alternation of the morphological features of MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. In this study, MCF-7 cells treated <lb/>with an IC 50 of 5a showed detectable morphological signs of apoptosis such as cell rounding and shrinkage with <lb/>decreased cell number detachment, and cytoplasmic condensation. However, the untreated cell morphology <lb/>appeared normal and confluent. These findings provided more information regarding the capacity of compound <lb/>5a to trigger cell death (Fig. 6). <lb/>Induction of cell cycle arrest of the MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. Cell cycle analysis was conducted on breast <lb/>cancer cells to better understand the mechanism of the 5a-mediated tumor growth inhibition, and the findings <lb/>are shown in Fig. 7. In the MCF-7 untreated cells, oncogenic RAS-induced proliferative signals resulted in the <lb/>upregulation of transcriptional factors required for cell cycle entrance and cellular progression. Additionally, the <lb/>metabolic stability of cyclin D1 was affected by the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β, which <lb/>is correlated with continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 via PI3K-dependent <lb/>phosphorylation 17 . Moreover, oncogenic RAS accelerates cell cycle progression by reducing the inhibition <lb/>caused by antigrowth signaling pathways which inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors like p21 42 . <lb/>Oncogenic RAS may contribute to gene instability in cancer via the promotion of G 2 /M phase transition, inhibi-<lb/>tion of G 2 DNA checkpoints, and induction of defects in mitotic spindle checkpoints 43 . Herein, by treating the <lb/>MCF-7 cells with the IC 50 of compound 5a the percentage of the cells was significantly arrested at sub-G0/G1 <lb/>at a rate of 48.5%, compared with that of the untreated control MCF-7 cells (8.6%).

			<body>Blocking of the RAS/PI3K/Akt/JNK signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. The elucidation of intra-<lb/>cellular signaling pathways and the identification of oncogenes have ushered in a new era of targeted therapy <lb/>that has greatly improved the prognosis for many malignancies. New therapies targeting these proteins and their <lb/>downstream mediators have established their capability to stabilize and shrink tumors 44 . <lb/>RAS oncogenes are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer, and RAS-mutant malignancies <lb/>account for a significant portion of all human diseases 45 . RAS proteins cycle between two conformational states, <lb/>that is, the active form when they are bound to GTP and the inactive form when bound to GDP. Guanine nucleo-<lb/>tide exchange factors (GEFs) are known to stimulate GTP-bound RAS formation, whereas GTPase-activating <lb/>proteins (GAPs) promote GTP hydrolysis on RAS thereby returning them to the inactive state 46 . In numerous <lb/>human malignancies, including breast carcinoma, active forms of RAS have been found to induce cellular trans-<lb/>formation. Thus, one of the therapeutic approaches to treating breast cancer is the efficient control of oncogenic <lb/>RAS 47 . In this study, western blot analysis revealed that treatment with the IC 50 of 5a significantly decreased the <lb/>levels of p-RAS proteins as compared to the MCF-7 untreated cells. This suggested the antiproliferative nature <lb/>of this novel compound (Fig. 9). <lb/>Figure 4. (Left side) 2D and (right side) 3D represent the interactions of the docked novel synthesized <lb/>pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives with amino acid residues of the H-RAS target protein. <lb/></body>

			<body>Activated RAS enhances cellular proliferation by modifying a wide range of intracellular effector pathways <lb/>that eventually converge to promote growth and suppress apoptotic signals in transformed cells. The PI3K-Akt <lb/>pathway has been described as a dominant growth survival pathway in breast cancer. The elevation of PI3K-Akt <lb/>signaling is a common mechanism that malignant cells require to proliferate and escape programmed cell death 48 . <lb/>Hence, in the present study, we examined the effect of 5a on the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by assessing <lb/>PI3K, Akt, and p21 gene expression as well as p53 protein expression in MCF-7 cells. <lb/>RAS protein interacts with PI3K, thereby, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of Akt 46 . PI3K phos-<lb/>phorylates inositol phospholipids and generates the secondary messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphos-<lb/>phate (PIP3), which triggers the phosphorylation and activation of the downstream serine/threonine kinase <lb/>Akt. In turn, Akt promotes cell survival by modulating key proteins with various biological functions 49 . In this <lb/>study, the IC 50 of 5a treatment significantly reduced mRNA transcript level of PI3K and Akt compared with the <lb/>MCF-7 untreated cells which strongly indicated the inhibitory effect of 5a on the RAS/PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 8). <lb/>Additionally, phosphorylated Akt is a well-established cell survival factor because it downregulates both <lb/>p21 and p53 50 . In this work, the treatment with the IC 50 of 5a significantly upregulated p21 gene expression <lb/>compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 8). Moreover, the immunoblot analysis confirmed a significant eleva-<lb/>tion of p53 protein expression in the 5a-treated cells compared with that in the MCF-7 untreated cells (Fig. 9). <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>After the treatment with 5a, the upregulation of p21 gene expression and p53 protein expression confirmed the <lb/>antineoplastic effect of 5a toward human breast cancer cells by suppressing the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. <lb/>Furthermore, RAS is known to activate the JNK/MAP kinase signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation <lb/>of c-Jun and augmentation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity. Hence, we investigated the <lb/>effect of 5a on the cell survival pathway, that is, the RAS/JNK pathway. Our study showed a significant reduction <lb/>in the p-JNK protein expression when compared with that in the MCF-7 untreated cells suggesting the inhibitory <lb/>effect of 5a on the RAS/JNK pathway (Fig. 9). These results may have been obtained because JNK contributes to <lb/>the RAS-induced estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, the JNK pathway is involved <lb/>in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are associated with extracellular matrix degradation <lb/>and tumor metastasis. Moreover, there is an association between the JNK/c-Jun activation and angiogenesis in <lb/>invasive breast carcinoma 51 . Indeed, JNK inhibition can cause apoptosis of tumor cells 52 . <lb/>SAR (structure-anti cancer activity relationship). For novel synthesized compounds, the in vitro anti-cancer <lb/>and molecular docking results showed the following structure activity relationship (Fig. 10): <lb/>• The presence of a bioactive pyrazole ring increases the anticancer activities 53 . <lb/>• (-OH) and (-OCH 3 ) that was found at the aromatic ring improved the anticancer activities. <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>• The presence of pyrimidine ring is considered an essential moiety for enhancing anticancer activity 54 . <lb/>• The high aromaticity of the prepared compounds enhanced the anticancer activities. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives 2-6 were successfully synthesized via conventional and ultrasonic irradiation <lb/>techniques. The ultrasonic technique was found to be more effective than conventional heating, as evidenced <lb/>by its higher yields and short reaction times. compound 5a was selected among the others according to their in <lb/>silico molecular free binding energy docking studies towards inhibiting the H-RAS target protein and obeyed <lb/>Lipinski&apos;s rule of five. Additionally, the results of the in vitro studies emphasized that the newly synthesized <lb/>compound 5a induced cell death via targeting the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, it upregulated <lb/>p21 and p53 proteins in the human breast cancer cells. Finally, compound 5a exhibited antineoplastic activity <lb/>via the inhibition of p-JNK protein in cancer cells. Therefore, 5a appears to be an attractive antitumor compound <lb/>with future clinical applications for breast cancer treatment (Fig. 11). <lb/>Figure 4. (continued) <lb/></body>
