Despite their reputation as &quot;junk&quot; DNA or genomic parasites <lb/>deleterious for the host, TEs have complex interactions with host genes and the potential <lb/>to contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression. It has been hypothesized that <lb/>TEs and genes they insert near may be transcriptionally activated in response to stress <lb/>conditions. The maize genome, with many different types of TEs interspersed with <lb/>genes, provides an ideal system to study the genome-wide influence of TEs on gene <lb/>regulation. To analyze the magnitude of the TE effect on gene expression response to <lb/>environmental changes, we profiled gene and TE transcript levels in maize seedlings <lb/>exposed to a number of abiotic stresses. Many genes exhibit up-or down-regulation in <lb/>response to these stress conditions. The analysis of TE families inserted within upstream <lb/>regions of up-regulated genes revealed that between four and nine different TE families <lb/>are associated with up-regulated gene expression in each of these stress conditions, <lb/>affecting up to 20% of the genes up-regulated in response to abiotic stress and as many as <lb/>33% of genes that are only expressed in response to stress. Expression of many of these <lb/>same TE families also responds to the same stress conditions. The analysis of the stress-<lb/>induced transcripts and proximity of the transposon to the gene suggests that these TEs <lb/>may provide local enhancer activities that stimulate stress-responsive gene expression. <lb/>Our data on allelic variation for insertions of several of these TEs show strong correlation <lb/>between the presence of TE insertions and stress-responsive up-regulation of gene <lb/>expression. Our findings suggest that TEs provide an important source of allelic <lb/>regulatory variation in gene response to abiotic stress in maize. <lb/>! 2 <lb/>

            Author summary: <lb/>Transposable elements are mobile DNA elements that are a prevalent component of many <lb/>eukaryotic genomes. While transposable elements can often have deleterious effects <lb/>through insertions into protein-coding genes they may also contribute to regulatory <lb/>variation of gene expression. There are a handful of examples in which specific <lb/>transposon insertions contribute to regulatory variation of nearby genes, particularly in <lb/>response to environmental stress. We sought to understand the genome-wide influence of <lb/>transposable elements on gene expression responses to abiotic stress in maize, a plant <lb/>with many families of transposable elements located in between genes. Our analysis <lb/>suggests that a small number of maize transposable element families may contribute to <lb/>the response of nearby genes to abiotic stress by providing stress-responsive enhancer-<lb/>like functions. The specific insertions of transposable elements are often polymorphic <lb/>within a species. Our data demonstrate that allelic variation for insertions of the <lb/>transposable elements associated with stress-responsive expression can contribute to <lb/>variation in the regulation of nearby genes. Thus novel insertions of transposable <lb/>elements provide a potential mechanism for genes to acquire cis-regulatory influences <lb/>that could contribute to heritable variation for stress response. <lb/>! <lb/></front>

            <body>Introduction: <lb/>Transposable elements (TEs), first described as &quot;controlling elements&quot; by Barbara <lb/>McClintock [1], are now known to make up the majority of angiosperm DNA [2]-[4]. TE <lb/>insertions within genes may result in mutant alleles by changing the reading frame or <lb/>splice pattern, frequently negatively affecting gene function. However, TEs also have the <lb/>potential to contribute to regulation of gene expression, potentially playing an important <lb/>role in responses to environmental stress [2], [5]; McClintock initially referred to TEs as <lb/>&quot;controlling elements&quot; based on their ability to influence the expression of nearby genes <lb/>[1], [6]. Several specific examples of TE influence on the expression of nearby genes <lb/>! 3 <lb/>have now been documented (reviewed by [7]-[11]). TE insertions near genes may <lb/>influence gene expression through several potential mechanisms, including inserting <lb/>within cis-regulatory regions, contributing an outward reading promoter from the TE into <lb/>the gene [12]-[15], or providing novel cis-regulatory sequences that can act as enhancers/ <lb/>repressors by facilitating transcription factor binding [16], or influencing the chromatin <lb/>state of gene promoter regions [17]-[19]. <lb/>! <lb/>Some TEs exhibit stress-responsive transcription or movement [20]-[25]. For example, <lb/>expression of the tobacco Tnt1 element can be induced by biotic and abiotic stress [22]-<lb/>[23]. The rice DNA transposon mPing can be activated in response to cold and salt stress <lb/>[26]-[27]. The Arabidopsis retrotransposon ONSEN is transcriptionally activated by heat <lb/>stress [16], [28]-[29]. Tissue culture is a complex stress that can result in the activation <lb/>of DNA transposons in maize and retrotransposons in rice [30]-[31]. There is also <lb/>evidence that some of these TE responses to environmental conditions can affect the <lb/>expression of nearby genes. Novel mPing MITE insertions in the rice genome in some <lb/>cases resulted in up-regulation of nearby genes in response to cold or salt stress with no <lb/>change in expression in control conditions [26]-[27]. The ONSEN retrotransposon <lb/>insertions near Arabidopsis genes exhibit similar properties: alleles containing ONSEN <lb/>insertions often show heat-responsive regulation while alleles lacking ONSEN are not up-<lb/>regulated by heat stress [16]. These studies suggest that TEs can provide novel <lb/>regulatory mechanisms and influence the response to environmental stress. <lb/>! <lb/>Maize provides a good system for studying the potential influence of TEs on regulation <lb/>of nearby genes. While TEs only account for ~10% of the Arabidopsis genome [32] or <lb/>~32% of the rice genome [33], they contribute ~85% to the maize genome [34]-[35]. <lb/>Many TEs are located in pericentromeric regions and heterochromatic maize knobs [34], <lb/>[36], but there are also many TE insertions interspersed between maize genes [37]-[39]. <lb/>! </body>

            <body>The majority of maize genes (66%) are located within 1kb of an annotated transposon <lb/>[35]. In addition, allelic variation for the presence of TE insertions near genes is high in <lb/>maize [39] -[41], creating the potential for allelic regulatory differences at nearby genes. <lb/>For example, polymorphic TE insertions in different haplotypes of the tb1, Vgt1 and <lb/>ZmCCT loci likely contribute to regulatory differences for these genes [42] -[44]. <lb/>! <lb/>While there are good examples to suggest that specific TEs can influence the response of <lb/>nearby genes to abiotic stress [16], [26] it remains unclear how widespread this <lb/>phenomenon is, how many genes are activated in such a TE-dependent manner, and <lb/>whether multiple TE families are capable of controlling stress response. We identified a <lb/>subset of TE families over-represented in the promoters of maize genes that exhibit <lb/>stress-responsive up-regulation or activation of gene expression. Based on our data, as <lb/>many as 20% of genes that showed increased expression in response to stress are located <lb/>near a TE from one of these families. We find that stress-responsive TEs appear to <lb/>provide enhancer-like activity for nearby promoters and allelic variation for TE insertions <lb/>is strongly associated with variation in expression response to stress for individual genes. <lb/>! <lb/>Results: <lb/>We extracted and sequenced RNA from 14 day old seedlings of inbred lines B73, Mo17 <lb/>and Oh43 grown using standard conditions as well as seedlings that had been subjected to <lb/>cold (5 0 C for 16 hours), heat (50 0 C for 4 hours), high salt (watered with 300 mM NaCl 20 <lb/>hours prior to collection) or UV stress (2 hours) (see Materials and Methods for details). <lb/>For each stress the plants were sampled immediately following the stress treatment and <lb/>there were no apparent morphological changes in these plants relative to control plants. <lb/>However, when the stressed plants were allowed to recover for 24 hours under standard <lb/>conditions phenotypic consequences became apparent for several of the stress treatments <lb/>(Figure 1A-B). RNAseq data was generated for three biological replicates for cold and <lb/>!</body>

            <body>heat stress and one sample for the high salt and UV stress (SRA accessions and read <lb/>number for each sample are provided in Table S1). Differentially expressed genes <lb/>(RPKM&gt;1 in control or stressed samples, padj&lt;0.1 in DESeq [45] analysis, and minimum <lb/>of 2-fold change in stress compared to control) were identified in control relative to cold <lb/>or heat treated plants for each genotype using both the filtered gene set (FGS) and <lb/>working gene set (WGS) genes (Table S2). For each stress by genotype combination we <lb/>found that 18%-30% of the expressed genes (7 -10% of all genes) exhibit significant <lb/>changes in expression level with similar frequencies of up-and down-regulated <lb/>expression changes (Table S2). For the salt and UV stress we identified genes that <lb/>exhibit at least 2-fold change in expression and RPKM &gt;1 in at least one of the <lb/>conditions. The analysis of data for heat/cold stress revealed that the genes identified as <lb/>differentially expressed based on a single replicate of this data had &gt;90% overlap with the <lb/>genes identified as significant in the analysis of multiple replicates. The clustering of <lb/>gene expression responses to abiotic stress suggests that each stress has a substantial <lb/>influence on the transcriptome (Figure 1C). While all three inbred lines showed similar <lb/>transcriptional responses to the stress conditions there is also evidence for genotype-<lb/>specific responses (Figure 1C). <lb/>! <lb/>Some TE families are associated with stress-responsive expression of nearby genes: <lb/>To test the hypothesis that genes responding to abiotic stress may be influenced by nearby <lb/>TE insertions we focused our initial analyses on expression responses in the inbred B73, <lb/>for which a reference genome is available [35]. The TEs located within 1 kb of the <lb/>transcription start site (TSS) of each gene were identified in the B73 reference genome. <lb/>For each of 576 annotated TE families we determined whether genes located near the <lb/>transposon were significantly enriched (p&lt;0.001, &gt;2 fold-enrichment and at least 10 <lb/>expressed genes associated with the TE family) for responsiveness to each of the stress <lb/>conditions (separate analyses for enrichment in up-or down-regulated genes for each <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>6 <lb/></page>

            <body>stress) relative to non-differentially expressed genes (Table S3). While the majority of <lb/>transposon families are not associated with stress-responsive expression changes for <lb/>nearby genes (Figure 2A-B; Table S3), 20 TE families are significantly enriched for being <lb/>located near genes with stress-responsive up-regulation and 3 TE families are associated <lb/>with genes down-regulated in response to stress (Figure 2C; Table 1). <lb/>! <lb/>Examples of the expression changes for genes in different abiotic stresses are shown for <lb/>two transposon families, ipiki and etug (Figure 2D). Genes located near ipiki are <lb/>enriched for up-regulation following salt and UV stress while genes located near etug <lb/>elements are enriched for heat-responsive up-regulation. One striking example is the <lb/>joemon TE family for which 59 of 68 expressed genes containing an insertion within 1 kb <lb/>are activated following cold stress (Table 1). Although similar numbers of genes exhibit <lb/>increased and decreased gene expression genome-wide following abiotic stress <lb/>conditions, the majority of enriched TE family -stress combinations (28/31) are <lb/>associated with up-regulated gene expression. For each of the stress conditions there <lb/>were 4-9 TE families that are associated with up-regulation of gene expression. Some TE <lb/>families are associated with altered expression in multiple stress treatments (Table 1, <lb/>Table S4; Figure 2C) and two of the TE families associated with down-regulation of gene <lb/>expression under high salt stress were also associated with increased gene expression <lb/>under UV stress. <lb/>! <lb/>The TE families enriched for genes activated in response to stress include all major <lb/>super-families of TEs: TIR DNA transposons, LTR gypsy-like (RLG), copia-like (RLC), <lb/>or unknown (RLX) retrotransposons, and LINE elements (Table 1,). These TE families <lb/>vary substantially for the number of genes that they are located near: from 30 to 3052 <lb/>genes (Table 1; Table S4) and are spread uniformly across the maize genome. The <lb/>presence of these TEs near genes is not fully sufficient for stress-responsive expression. <lb/>!</body>

            <page>7 <lb/></page>

            <body>For each of the TE families identified, 26 -87% of genes located near a TE insertion <lb/>show stress responsive expression depending on the stress and the TE family. The <lb/>expression levels for the TEs themselves was assessed for each of the treatments and in <lb/>the majority of TE family -stress combinations (14 of 21 with expression data) the TEs <lb/>showed at least 2-fold increase in transcript levels in the stress treatment compared to <lb/>control conditions (Table 1, Table S4). There are several examples of TE families that <lb/>exhibit increased levels of expression in a particular stress but the nearby genes are not <lb/>enriched for stress-responsive expression (Table S3), suggesting that not all TEs that are <lb/>influenced by a particular stress influence nearby genes. <lb/>! <lb/>To understand what proportion of the transcriptome response to a specific abiotic stress <lb/>may be explained by influences of specific TEs inserted near genes, up-regulated genes <lb/>were classified according to whether they were located near a member of one of the <lb/>stress-associated TE families (1 kb 5&apos; from TSS) and whether they are up-regulated <lb/>(expressed under control and stress conditions) or activated in response to stress (only <lb/>expressed following stress treatment). We found that a substantial portion of the <lb/>transcriptome response to the abiotic stress could be associated with genes located near <lb/>the set of 4-9 TE families that were identified as enriched for up-regulated genes (Figure <lb/>2E). In total, 5-20% of the genome-wide transcriptome response to the abiotic stress and <lb/>as many as 33% of activated genes could be attributed to the genes located near one of <lb/>these TE families (Figure 2E; Table S5-6). <lb/>! <lb/>Some TE families act as local enhancers of stress-responsive expression: <lb/>One possible mechanism by which these families of TEs could contribute to stress-<lb/>responsive expression for nearby genes is that the TE may provide an outward-reading <lb/>promoter that is stress-responsive. This model predicts that the orientation of the TE <lb/>relative to the gene is important and that novel transcripts containing TE sequences fused <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>8 <lb/></page>

            <body>to gene sequences would be present for up-regulated genes under stress conditions. In <lb/>order to assess the importance of the orientation of the TE insertion relative to the gene, <lb/>we compared the proportion of genes located on the same strand as a TE for genes up-<lb/>regulated in response to stress and genes non-differentially expressed in response to stress <lb/>for all TE families enriched for up-regulated genes (Table S7). While most families <lb/>showed no significant difference in the proportion of genes on the same strand as the TE <lb/>between the up-regulated and non-differentially expressed genes, a minority of families <lb/>(4/20) showed significant enrichment. For example, 97% of the stress-responsive genes <lb/>located near etug elements are on the same strand as the TE (Table S7). Nonetheless, <lb/>visual inspection of the RNAseq alignments did not reveal evidence for stress-responsive <lb/>transcripts that initiate within the TE and include the gene. <lb/>! <lb/>Alternative models include the possibility that the TE may contain cis-regulatory <lb/>sequences that can act as binding sites for stress-induced transcription factors, or that the <lb/>TE could influence the local chromatin environment in such a way that the region is more <lb/>accessible under stress conditions. The analysis of TE distance from transcription start <lb/>sites of stress-responsive genes suggests that in many cases the effect of TE on stress-<lb/>responsive gene activation quickly diminishes as the distance increases beyond 500 bp -<lb/>1kb (Figure S1A). The DREB/CBF transcription factors are often involved in <lb/>transcriptional responses to abiotic stress in plants [46]. The consensus sequence for <lb/>DREB/CBF binding (A/GCCGACNT [47]) was found in most of the TEs that were <lb/>associated with stress-responsive expression for nearby genes, with the exception of <lb/>elements that only exhibit UV stress response (Figure S1B). While we did not have <lb/>evidence to distinguish between the possibilities that TEs provide either a sequence-<lb/>specific binding site that might act as a stress-specific enhancer or influence the <lb/>chromatin state in a non-sequence specific manner, our data are consistent with the TE <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>9 <lb/></page>

            <body>insertions acting predominantly as local enhancers of expression rather than as novel <lb/>promoters. <lb/>! <lb/>Because individual TE copies are subject to frequent rearrangements and internal <lb/>deletions, we investigated whether the presence of specific regions in each TE family <lb/>were over-represented in insertions that confer stress-responsive expression. For six of <lb/>the 20 TE families, this comparison revealed specific portions of the TE sequences <lb/>enriched among insertions that convey stress-responsive expression. For example, naiba <lb/>and etug insertions located near up-regulated genes are approximately four times as likely <lb/>to contain a particular portion of the TE long terminal repeat (LTR; p-value &lt; 0.001; Fig. <lb/>S2), and this same sequence is found in a subset of insertions of the related family, gyma, <lb/>that are associated with up-regulated genes. While we did not have evidence to rule out <lb/>the possibility that TEs influence the chromatin state in a non-sequence specific manner, <lb/>these data indicate that the presence of particular regions of TE elements likely provide <lb/>enhancer functions associated with gene expression responses to stress and help explain <lb/>the variable effect of different insertions of the same family on stress-responsive <lb/>expression. <lb/>! <lb/>Characterization of genes with TE-influenced stress responsive expression: <lb/>We assessed a number of properties of the TE-influenced stress-responsive genes in <lb/>comparison with stress-responsive genes that are not associated with one of these TE <lb/>families (Table 2). Stress-responsive genes located near the TE families tend to be <lb/>substantially shorter in length with fewer introns. Analysis of developmental expression <lb/>patterns for these genes using the B73 expression atlas [48] reveals that only 7% of the <lb/>TE influenced genes are expressed in at least 5 tissues, compared to 41% of the non-TE <lb/>influenced genes. The TE influenced genes are also less likely to be in the filtered gene <lb/>set (FGS), and the proportion of the TE influenced genes with syntenic homologs in other <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>10 <lb/></page>

            <body>grass species is much lower than the proportion of non-TE influenced genes (Table 2). <lb/>Each of these features was assessed separately for each of the TE families (Table S7) and <lb/>there is some variation for these properties among different families. These observations <lb/>are compatible with the notion that TE insertions may in some cases function as <lb/>enhancers that can drive expression of cryptic promoters in non-coding regions of the <lb/>genome. This will result in stress-responsive production of transcripts that may be <lb/>annotated as genes but may not produce functional proteins. However, 37% of TE <lb/>influenced genes are included in the FGS that has been curated to remove transposon-<lb/>derived sequences and a substantial proportion of the TE influenced genes are syntenic <lb/>with genes from other species, have GO annotations, and could contribute to functional <lb/>responses to stress (Table 2, S7). These results suggests that many of TE influenced <lb/>genes are not derived from TEs. <lb/>! <lb/>Contribution of TEs to allelic variation for stress-responsive expression: <lb/>We were particularly intrigued by the question of whether polymorphic insertions of TEs <lb/>from families associated with stress-responsive expression of nearby genes might <lb/>contribute to allelic variation for stress-responsive gene expression. The consistency of <lb/>stress-responsive expression of TE-associated genes across the three inbred lines <lb/>surveyed varied widely across TE families (Figure 3A; Figure S3). In order to assess <lb/>whether insertions of TEs from the families associated with stress-responsive gene <lb/>expression could contribute to allelic variation for gene expression regulation, we used <lb/>whole-genome shotgun re-sequencing data from Mo17 and Oh43 [49] to find potential <lb/>novel insertions of elements from the TE families identified in this study. We identified <lb/>23 novel (not present in B73) high-confidence insertions of TEs from these families <lb/>located within 1kb of the TSS of maize genes and validated them by PCR (Table S8). Of <lb/>the 10 genes with detectable expression in our RNAseq experiments, 7 showed stress-<lb/>responsive up-regulation / activation associated with the TE-containing alleles (Figure <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>11 <lb/></page>

            <body>3B). This analysis was expanded to additional genotypes by using PCR to detect the <lb/>presence/absence of the TE insertion in a diverse set of 29 maize inbred lines. The <lb/>relative expression of the gene in stress compared to control treatment was also <lb/>determined in each inbred using quantitative RT-PCR. For each of these genes we found <lb/>that the alleles that lack the transposon insertion did not exhibit stress-responsive <lb/>expression (Figure 4), with the exception of one genotype for gene GRMZM2G108057. <lb/>In contrast, the majority of the alleles that contain the TE (60-88%) exhibit stress-<lb/>responsive up-regulation. Although for a single insertion we cannot rule out the <lb/>possibility that differential expression is due to a different polymorphism on the same <lb/>haplotype as the TE, the fact that we see TE-associated expression change in multiple <lb/>genes for each of the TE families (Table. S8) argues strongly against such an explanation <lb/>in general. These data thus provide evidence that insertion polymorphisms for the TE <lb/>families identified here can generate novel expression responses for nearby genes. <lb/>! <lb/>Discussion: <lb/>! <lb/>Transposable elements are a major component of many eukaryotic genomes, and <lb/>constitute the majority of plant nuclear DNA. TEs are usually considered as a deleterious <lb/>or neutral component of these genomes. However, the interplay between TEs and genes <lb/>may have important functional contributions to plant traits. There are clear examples of <lb/>TE insertions that are linked to functionally relevant alleles in maize such as Tb1 [42] <lb/>Vgt1 [43] and ZmCCT [44]. In these cases, a transposon insertion within a distant cis-<lb/>regulatory sequence influences the regulation of adjacent genes. There are also examples <lb/>of functionally relevant TE insertions in tomato, melons and citrus [50]-[52] that can <lb/>influence gene expression, potentially through chromatin influences that generate <lb/>obligate epialleles. <lb/>! <lb/>!</body>

            <page>12 <lb/></page>

            <body>Previous research in several plant species has suggested that at least some families of <lb/>transposable elements may become transcriptionally activated following environmental <lb/>stress. Tissue culture has been shown to result in activation of transposons and <lb/>retrotransposons in a number of plant species [30]-[31]. There are also examples of <lb/>transcriptional activation of TEs in response to specific abiotic stresses in tobacco [22], <lb/>rice [26]-[27] and Arabidopsis [16], [28]-[29]. It is expected that the stress responsive <lb/>expression of these TEs involves local enhancers that result in up-regulation of the TE <lb/>promoter in response to stress. These local enhancers could also act upon other nearby <lb/>promoters. There are a handful of examples in which transposon insertions have been <lb/>linked to stress-responsive expression of nearby genes including the mPING insertions <lb/>associated with cold-responsive expression in rice [26]-[27] and ONSEN insertions <lb/>associated with heat-stress responsive expression in Arabidopsis [16]. If this is a <lb/>common occurrence then we might expect it to be even more prevalent in a genome such <lb/>as maize where many genes are closely surrounded by TEs. <lb/>! <lb/>Our analysis suggested that a small number of TE families are associated with stress-<lb/>responsive expression for nearby genes. While some TE families were associated with <lb/>multiple stresses, we found a different subset of TE families for each abiotic stress that <lb/>was evaluated. In most cases, these same TEs themselves were up-regulated in response <lb/>to the stress treatment. However, we also noted that there were some TE families that <lb/>themselves exhibit strong up-regulation but did not have apparent influences on a <lb/>significant portion of nearby genes. Even though the majority of stress responsive <lb/>regulation of gene expression is not associated with TEs, based on our data, up to 20% of <lb/>genes up-regulated in response to stress and as many as 33% of genes activated in <lb/>response to stress could be attributed to regulation by TEs. One of the alternative <lb/>explanations would argue that only a small number of genes localized close to a TE are <lb/>truly influenced by this TE insertion for their expression, while other up-regulated genes <lb/>!</body> 

            <page>13 <lb/></page>

            <body>are secondary targets and are regulated by the TE influenced genes. Although some of <lb/>the TE influenced genes we identified could be secondary targets, secondary target genes <lb/>would not preferentially co-localize with TEs from specific families. <lb/>! <lb/>The analysis of the nearby genes that were influenced by TEs suggests that many of them <lb/>may not actually be protein coding genes. In one sense, this is an expected result. If an <lb/>enhancer sequence is mobilized within the genome it will have the potential to influence <lb/>expression from both gene promoter as well as cryptic promoters that may not be <lb/>associated with coding sequences. The gene annotation efforts in maize have relied upon <lb/>EST and RNA-seq expression data from a variety of conditions. In many cases the genes <lb/>that were found to exhibit stress-responsive expression associated with TEs were only <lb/>annotated as genes based upon evidence of their expression. We would expect that <lb/>insertions of the TEs that provide stress-responsive enhancer activity would influence <lb/>cryptic promoters not associated with genes in many cases, but would also affect the <lb/>expression of nearby protein coding genes. The frequency of each appeared to vary <lb/>among TE families, with some, like nihep, showing little difference between TE-<lb/>influenced and non-TE-influenced up-regulated genes (Table S7). Overall, while TE <lb/>influenced stress-responsive genes are enriched for short sequences with limited <lb/>homology to sequences in other species, a significant proportion are longer, have several <lb/>exons, are conserved in other species, and have GO annotations. <lb/>! <lb/>A particularly interesting aspect of these results is the potential mechanism for creating <lb/>novel cis-regulatory variation. Our understanding of how particular genes might acquire <lb/>novel regulatory mechanisms is limited. In many cases SNPs within promoters or <lb/>regulatory sequences have limited functional significance. Therefore, it is difficult to <lb/>envision how a novel response to a particular environmental or developmental cue would <lb/>arise. Variation in TE insertions has the potential to create novel regulatory alleles by <lb/>!</body>

            <body>providing binding sites for transcription factors or influencing chromatin. We provide <lb/>evidence that allelic variation for stress-responsive expression can be created by the <lb/>insertion of certain TEs. Variation in TE insertions would generate allelic diversity that <lb/>could influence an organism&apos;s response to environmental conditions and would provide <lb/>phenotypic variation that could be acted upon by selection. As with other types of <lb/>variation, most examples of novel stress-responsive expression are likely to be neutral or <lb/>deleterious and would not be expected to rise in allele frequency. However, a subset of <lb/>novel stress-responsive expression patterns could be beneficial and become targets of <lb/>natural or artificial selection contributing to gene regulation networks of environmental <lb/>stress response. <lb/>! <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Plant growth and stress conditions <lb/>B73, Mo17, and Oh43 maize seedlings were grown at 24 0 C in 1:1 mix of autoclaved field <lb/>soil and MetroMix under natural light conditions in July 2013. For cold stress, seedlings <lb/>were incubated at 5 0 C for 16 hours. For heat stress, seedlings were incubated at 50 0 C for <lb/>4 hours. For high salt stress, plants were watered with 300 mM NaCl 20 hours prior to <lb/>tissue collection. UV stress was applied in the growth chamber conditions using UV-B <lb/>lamps for 2 hours prior to tissue collection. UV stress causes accumulation of DNA <lb/>mutations but most of such mutations would either have no immediate effect on gene <lb/>expression or would lead to decrease or abortion of expression of specific genes. Light <lb/>conditions were the same for all stress and control conditions. Whole above ground <lb/>tissue was collected for 14 day old seedlings at 9am and six seedlings were pooled <lb/>together for each sample. Three replicates for heat and cold-treated B73 and Mo17 <lb/>seedlings were grown 3 days apart. <lb/>! <lb/>RNA isolation and RNAseq analysis <lb/>!</body>

            <body>Three biological replicates of cold and heat stress and control conditions for B73 and <lb/>Mo17 were prepared with eight plants pooled for each of the replicates. One biological <lb/>replicate of high salt and UV stress conditions for B73 and Mo17 as well as all four stress <lb/>and control conditions for Oh43 were prepared similarly.

Transcript abundance was <lb/>calculated by mapping reads to the combined transcript models of the maize reference <lb/>genome (AGPv2) using TopHat [53]. Reads were filtered to allow for only uniquely <lb/>mapped reads. A high degree of correlation between replicates was observed (r&gt;0.98). <lb/>RPKM values were developed using &apos;BAM to Counts&apos; across the exon space of the <lb/>maize genome reference working gene set (ZmB73_5a) within the iPlant Discovery <lb/>Environment (www.iplantcollaborative.org). Genes were considered to be expressed if <lb/>RPKM&gt;1 and differentially expressed if log2(stress/control) &gt; 1 or log2(stress/control) &lt; <lb/>-1. Statistical significance of expression differences was determined using DeSeq <lb/>package for all fully replicated samples [45]. <lb/>! <lb/>Data Analysis <lb/>For each gene, transposons located within 1 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) were <lb/>identified using the B73 reference genome annotation [35] and maize TE elements <lb/>database [34]. TE distance from transcription start sites was determined using the <lb/>closestBed tool from the BEDTools suite [54] where TEs upstream were given a positive <lb/>distance value and TEs downstream were given a negative distance value. The <lb/>transcriptional start site was defined as the 100-bp window intersecting the first base pair <lb/>of a gene model from the maize genome gene set (ZmB73_5b). The proportion of up-<lb/>regulated, down-regulated, and non-differentially expressed genes that have an insertion <lb/>!</body>

            <body>of a TE element from a particular family was calculated for 576 TE families for four <lb/>stress conditions. Fold-enrichment of up-regulated genes relative to all expressed genes <lb/>(the sum of up-regulated, down-regulated and non-differentially expressed genes) and <lb/>relative to all genes was calculated for all TE family / stress combinations. Given the <lb/>total number of expressed genes associated with each TE family and the proportion of up-<lb/>and down-regulated genes, the expected numbers of up-and down-regulated genes and <lb/>non-differentially expressed genes were calculated and a multinomial fit test was <lb/>conducted. TE families that had over 10 expressed genes associated with them, fold <lb/>enrichment of up-or down-regulated genes over 2, and p value &lt;0.001 were considered <lb/>&quot;enriched&quot; for up-or down-regulated, respectively. Similar analysis was conducted for <lb/>working gene set and filtered gene set genes. The same set of &quot;enriched&quot; TE families <lb/>was found for both groups of genes as well as when fold enrichment was calculated <lb/>relative to all expressed genes or to all genes associated with TEs from a particular <lb/>family. <lb/>! <lb/>To assess expression changes in response to stress for TE families, the overlap tool from <lb/>BEDTools suite [54] was used to obtain read counts per each TE accession. The output <lb/>file from alignment (BAM) was mapped to TE positions listed in the TE GFF file <lb/>downloaded from maizesequence.org. Each read was required to have 100% overlap <lb/>with a given TE region. The reads mapping to more than 5 locations in the genome were <lb/>omitted. The reads were then summed across the entire TE region and combined for each <lb/>of the TE families. <lb/>! <lb/>Tissue specific expression data is from the maize gene expression atlas [47]. Genes with <lb/>RPKM of &lt;1 were considered non-expressed. Orthologous and paralogous gene pairs <lb/>were inferred from [55]. <lb/>! <lb/>!</body>

            <body>TE polymorphism prediction and verification <lb/>Nonreference TE insertions were detected for Oh43 and Mo17 using relocaTE [56], <lb/>whole genome sequence from the NCBI SRA (Oh43: SRR447831-SRR447847; Mo17: <lb/>SRR447948-SRR447950), and consensus TE sequences from the maize TE database <lb/>[34]. Reads containing TEs were identified by mapping to consensus TE sequences, <lb/>trimming portions of reads mapping to a TE, and mapping the remaining sequence to the <lb/>reference genome. Nonreference TEs were identified when at least one uniquely mapped <lb/>read supported both flanking sequences of the nonreference TE, overlapping for a <lb/>characteristic distance that reflects the target site duplication generated upon integration <lb/>(five nucleotides for all LTR retrotransposons, nine nucleotides for DNA TIR mutator). <lb/>Primers for six TE polymorphic genes up-regulated under stress conditions in Oh43 or <lb/>Mo17 but not in B73 were designed using Primer 3.0 software [57] and PCR reactions <lb/>were performed using Hot Start Taq Polymerase (Qiagen, Ca, USA). Primer sequences <lb/>are shown in Supplementary Table 10. <lb/>cDNA synthesis and qPCR <lb/>cDNA synthesis and qPCR analysis were performed as described in [58].

Properties of TE insertions that stress-responsive expression. <lb/>(A) In our initial screening we only analyzed TE insertions located within 1kb of the <lb/>TSS. Here we assessed the proportion of genes that exhibit stress-responsive expression <lb/>for TE insertions located at different distances from the TSS (for the stress condition most <lb/>associated with each TE family). Some of the TE families appear to only affect genes if <lb/>they are inserted quite near the TSS while others can have influences at distances. (B) <lb/>The CBF/DREB transcription factors have been associated with stress-responsive <lb/>expression in a number of plant species [46]. We identified consensus CBF/DREB <lb/>binding sites (A/GCCGACNT) in the consensus TE sequences (maizetedb.org) for the <lb/>TEs associated with each of the stresses as well as in 40 randomly selected TEs that were <lb/>not associated with gene expression responses to stress or 40 randomly selected 5kb <lb/>genomic regions. The proportion of sequences that contained a CBF/DREB binding site <lb/>and the average number of sites per element are shown.
