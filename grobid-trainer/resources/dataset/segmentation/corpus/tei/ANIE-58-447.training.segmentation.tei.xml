			<body>More than 130 years have passed since Arthur Michael <lb/>reported his groundbreaking studies on the conjugate addi-<lb/>tion of malonate nucleophiles. [1] In the intervening time,much <lb/>work has been devoted to the development of asymmetric <lb/>variants of this reaction, which has become as taple trans-<lb/>formation of the organic chemistsr epertoire. [2] Given the <lb/>versatility of the carbonyl functional group,t he Michael <lb/>addition of an enolate to an unsaturated carbonyl group is one <lb/>of the definitive methods for generating a1 ,5-dicarbonyl <lb/>relationship,and as aconsequence,such transformations can <lb/>be frequently found in total syntheses. [3] <lb/>Themild conditions of conjugate addition, as the Michael <lb/>reaction has come to be colloquially known, also lend this <lb/>reaction well to other areas of research such as bioconjugation <lb/>or dynamic combinatorial chemistry. [4] As aresult, methods to <lb/>synthesize a,b-unsaturated systems are highly prized. Con-<lb/>venient and efficient pathways include carbonyl olefination [5] <lb/>and olefin cross-metathesis, [6] although the ability to directly <lb/>generate a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds from their <lb/>corresponding saturated counterparts by dehydrogenation <lb/>adds considerable flexibility to synthetic planning. Pioneering <lb/>work by Kingsbury and Cram on the concerted thermal <lb/>elimination of alkyl sulfoxides [7] later inspired similar work on <lb/>selenoxide elimination. [8] TheS aegusa-Ito oxidation [9] is <lb/>another well-known and often employed route to dehydro-<lb/>genated carbonyl systems but is atwo-step procedure.Despite <lb/>the original use of stoichiometric palladium, notable efforts <lb/>have been made to develop efficient catalytic reactions based <lb/>on much greener oxidants by the groups of Stahl [10] and <lb/>others. [11] Although reliable,these methods often involve two <lb/>steps or are limited to (cyclic) ketones.O ther important <lb/>contributions include the work of Nicolaou and co-workers, <lb/>who reported the use of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) to <lb/>oxidise ketones to the corresponding a,b-enones. [12] <lb/>When considering the direct dehydrogenation of carbonyl <lb/>compounds beyond ketones and aldehydes,am ajor obstacle <lb/>is the significantly reduced a-acidity of esters,n itriles,o r <lb/>particularly carboxamides.N ewhouse and co-workers pub-<lb/>lished an umber of impressive reports showcasing how zinc <lb/>enolates (generated by transmetalation from the correspond-<lb/>ing lithium counterparts), including those derived from <lb/>amides,c an be dehydrogenated under palladium catalysis [13] <lb/>(Scheme 1a). [14] Furthermore,t hese authors have demon-<lb/>strated this methodology to be applicable in total synthesis. [15] <lb/>Dong and Chen used ar elated strategy to desaturate <lb/>N-acyl lactams, [16] relying on two-point binding activation <lb/>(Scheme 1b), and most recently,the group of Huang showed <lb/>that iridium catalysis could be used for desaturation in the <lb/>specific case of g,d-unsaturated amides (Scheme 1c). [17] <lb/>We believed that there remained space for complemen-<lb/>tary methods that proceed under conditions tolerant of other <lb/>carbonyl functional groups and that are applicable to <lb/>structurally diverse amides.W ee nvisaged the use of electro-<lb/>Scheme 1. Approaches to amide dehydrogenationa nd work presented <lb/>herein. DIPEA = diisopropylethylamine, 2-I-pyr = 2-iodopyridine, <lb/>LiCyan = lithium N-cyclohexyl anilide, TFA = trifluoroacetate, <lb/>Tf 2 O = triflic anhydride. <lb/></body>

			<body>philic amide activation [18] owing to the possibilities it might <lb/>afford in developing as trategy for chemoselective desatura-<lb/>tion of amides in the presence of other carbonyl functional <lb/>groups. [19] Herein, we report am ild, room-temperature a,b-<lb/>dehydrogenation of amides with broad applicability that is <lb/>selective for amides,thus reaching beyond the scope of most <lb/>current procedures as it does not rely on enolate formation. <lb/>Our reaction design was based on the simple assumption that <lb/>seleninic acid (PhSe(O)OH) might be nucleophilic enough to <lb/>attack ak eteniminium intermediate as shown in Scheme 1. <lb/>This might lead to an enamine-type species such as 2,w hich <lb/>could undergo an unusual [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. [20] <lb/>Ther esulting a-selenated species 3 should already be in the <lb/>oxidation state required for concerted elimination, ultimately <lb/>affording the a,b-dehydrogenated product in asingle step. <lb/>In initial efforts using amide 1a,t he desired dehydro-<lb/>genated product 4a was already observed, albeit in yields <lb/>never surpassing 50 %( Table 1, entry 1; see the Supporting <lb/>Information for additional experiments). Indeed, the crude <lb/>reaction mixture commonly contained variable amounts of <lb/>both a-hydroxylated amide 5 and a-selenated amide 6. <lb/>In subsequent experiments,w en oted that the use of <lb/>triethylamine as abase (Table 1, entry 2) yielded none of the <lb/>desaturated product (4a)and 50 %ofthe a-selenated amide 6 <lb/>instead. This prompted us to try the same reaction with the <lb/>addition of oxidants (see the Supporting Information for <lb/>more details), with hypervalent iodine species affording the <lb/>most promising results (Table 1, entries 3-6). With 2.2 equiv-<lb/>alents of Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP), the a,b-dehydro-<lb/>genated product was reproducibly formed in 73 %N MR <lb/>yield. This procedure avoided the formation of several other <lb/>products,t hus simplifying the purification process although <lb/>the yields of isolated products were,inmost cases,lower than <lb/>those measured by NMR analysis owing to difficulties in <lb/>separating the residual starting materials of nearly identical <lb/>polarity. <lb/>With optimized reaction conditions in hand, our attention <lb/>next turned to exploring the scope of the reaction (Scheme 2). <lb/>Pleasingly,abroad range of tertiary amides were tolerated by <lb/>this desaturation protocol. b-Substitution with ac yclopentyl <lb/>chain allowed the formation of 4b.Different cinnamyl amides <lb/>could be prepared by this method (4c-e). Notably, <lb/>a-substituted amides could also be dehydrogenated, and <lb/>indene 4f and cyclobutene amide 4g were isolated in good <lb/>yields.The 1,3-diene 4h was also prepared in moderate yield. <lb/>Thec onditions of the reaction tolerated the use of alkynes <lb/>(4i)a nd trifluoromethyl groups (4j). Te rtiary amides with <lb/>other N-substituents,i ncluding removable dibenzyl groups <lb/>(4k), morpholine (4l), piperidine (4m), or azepine (4n), <lb/>efficiently gave the corresponding desaturated amides.A ni-<lb/>line-derived amides were also well tolerated, delivering the <lb/>products in good yields (4o and 4p). <lb/>Aunique feature of this a,b-dehydrogenation reaction is <lb/>its high chemoselectivity.A mides can be selectively desatu-<lb/>rated even in the presence of commonly more reactive <lb/>carbonyl functional groups,s uch as esters and ketones,i n <lb/>moderate to good yields.T ot he best of our knowledge,n o <lb/>method exists that allows this type of selectivity.Methyl esters <lb/>were effectively spectators in the a,b-dehydrogenation of <lb/>different tertiary amides 4r-4u.Furthermore,the presence of <lb/>aketone (4v)oranitrile (4w)functional group did not divert <lb/>the reaction away from the amide moiety.A mides derived <lb/>from natural product feedstocks such as oleic acid (4x)o r <lb/>dehydrocholic acid (4y)could also be selectively desaturated <lb/>in good isolated yields.Anamide analogue of the blockbuster <lb/>drug citalopram was also successfully dehydrogenated to <lb/>afford product 4z.F inally,w es ubjected a1 3-membered <lb/>lactam to our procedure and pleasingly obtained the desatu-<lb/>rated product 4aa in moderate yield. <lb/>In order to further probe the selectivity of the reaction, we <lb/>subjected as ubstrate containing both as econdary and <lb/>atertiary amide to the reaction conditions.Pleasingly,product <lb/>4ab,r esulting from desaturation adjacent to the tertiary <lb/>amide,was exclusively obtained (Scheme 3a). We next sought <lb/>to showcase the utility of these Michael acceptor products. <lb/>Dihydroxylation proceeded smoothly to give product 7 in <lb/>69 %( Scheme 3b). [21] Asymmetric conjugate addition to <lb/>unsaturated amides,a sr ecently described by Harutyunyan <lb/>and co-workers, [22] was realized on unsaturated amide 4nwith <lb/>EtMgBr,r esulting in product 8 in 91 %y ield and 96 % ee <lb/>(Scheme 3c). Cognizant of the pervasiveness of amides in <lb/>nature, [23] we were keen to apply our method to the synthesis <lb/>of an atural product. We selected piperine (13;S cheme 3d), <lb/>ap olyunsaturated amide responsible for the pungencyo f <lb/>pepper. Piperine possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, <lb/>and antidepressant properties and has been synthesized <lb/>previously by av ariety of strategies. [24] Here,w ep ropose an <lb/>alternative three-step synthesis starting from the commer-<lb/>cially available aldehyde 9 (Scheme 3c). After quantitative <lb/>transformation of 9 into the allylic alcohol 10,this compound <lb/>was treated with the in situ prepared 1,1-diamino alkene 11 in <lb/>refluxing xylene to yield the g,d-unsaturated amide 12 in <lb/>av ery good 73 %y ield by am odified Claisen-Eschenmoser <lb/>rearrangement. [25] Further dehydrogenation of 12 delivered <lb/>piperine (13)inm oderate 42 %yield. <lb/>We then turned our attention to the mechanism of the <lb/>reaction. Preliminary work had demonstrated the formation <lb/>of the a-selenated amide 6 in 64 %y ield by addition of <lb/>Table 1: Optimization of the reaction. <lb/>Entry [Se] <lb/>Base <lb/>Oxidant <lb/>Yield [%] [a] <lb/>(equiv) <lb/>(equiv) <lb/>(equiv) <lb/>4a 561a <lb/>1P hSeO 2 H( 1) Ag 2 CO 3 (1.1) -4 82 0-<lb/>41 <lb/>2P hSeO 2 H( 1) Et 3 N(1.1) <lb/>--24 50 14 <lb/>3P hSeO 2 H( 1) Et 3 N(2.2) <lb/>PIDA (2.2) 22 12 -2 5 <lb/>4P hSeO 2 H( 1) Et 3 N(2.2) <lb/>IBX (2.2) <lb/>29 45 -2 1 <lb/>5P hSeO 2 H( 1) Et 3 N(2.2) <lb/>DMP (2.2) 73 <lb/>--<lb/>10 <lb/>6-<lb/>Et 3 N(2.2) <lb/>DMP (2.2) <lb/>82 -5 0 <lb/>[a] Yields determined by 1 HNMR analysis with bromoform as an internal <lb/>standard. 1,2-DCE = 1,2-dichloroethane, PIDA = iodobenzene diacetate. <lb/></body>

			<body>selenenic acid, PhSeOH, onto ak eteniminium ion (Sche-<lb/>me 4a). We hypothesized that this occurred by a[ 1,3]-<lb/>sigmatropic rearrangement from intermediate 2&apos; &apos;.D uring <lb/>this reaction, a-hydroxylated product 5 was also formed in <lb/>25 %, possibly by nucleophilic attack of PhSeOH on the <lb/>a-position of intermediate 2&apos; &apos; followed by hydrolysis.T hese <lb/>results led us to postulate pathway (i)( Scheme 4) for the <lb/>dehydrogenation mechanism by simple analogy,t he only <lb/>difference being the oxidation state of the selenium atom. <lb/>However,d uring the reaction discovery process,i tw as <lb/>observed that in the absence of an oxidant, the a-selenated <lb/>amide 6 remained the major product (Table 1, entry 2). Given <lb/>that pathway (i)g enerates PhSeOH (18), we believe it <lb/>possible that DMP could play two distinct roles:1 )trapping <lb/>of 18,w hich is likely more nucleophilic than seleninic acid, <lb/>and 2) oxidation of any 6 that is produced. In support of this <lb/>hypothesis,w eo bserved that DMP was able to oxidise <lb/>a-selenated amide 6 to desaturated amide 4a in moderate <lb/>yield (Scheme 4c). <lb/>Alternatively,b ecause it has been demonstrated that <lb/>iodylbenzoic acid can be used as an oxidant to generate <lb/>benzene seleninic anhydride (BSA) in situ from diphenyl <lb/>diselenide (PhSeSePh), [26] we believe that we may also be <lb/>generating BSA (17)u nder our reaction conditions. [27] <lb/>From the labelling studies we undertook with H 2 <lb/>18 O <lb/>(Scheme 4d), we established that keteniminium species 15 is <lb/>likely attacked by either water or acetate released by the <lb/>DMP,t og ive the enamine/enol (acetate) hybrid 16. [28] <lb/>Conceivably,r eaction of 16 with 17 would generate an <lb/>intermediate that leads to product 4a (Scheme 4, path-<lb/>way (ii)).

			<body>me 4b), we generated am ixture of 6 and 4a.T his further <lb/>suggests that an electrophilic,o xidized selenium species <lb/>(likely the mixed anhydride) plays some role in the reaction, <lb/>but also emphasizes that DMP is important, either to oxidise 6 <lb/>to 4a,o rt ot rap and re-oxidise species 18 and lower-<lb/>oxidation-state selenium species. [29] We speculate that the <lb/>modest efficiencyo ft he reaction in Scheme 4c indicates the <lb/>major role of the DMP to be as econdary oxidant of species <lb/>18,w hich avoids side reactions of the keteniminium inter-<lb/>mediate 15 with lower-oxidation-state selenium species. <lb/>In conclusion, we have reported an ovel method for the <lb/>synthesis of a,b-unsaturated amides from the corresponding <lb/>saturated amide starting materials.T he reaction proceeds by <lb/>electrophilic activation followed by au nique selenium-<lb/>mediated dehydrogenation. This process conveys good func-<lb/>tional group tolerance and, significantly,e nables the desatu-<lb/>ration of amides in the presence of esters,k etones,a nd <lb/>nitriles.W ea lso applied this method to the synthesis of the <lb/>natural product piperine.C urrent experiments allude to <lb/>am echanism that involves attack onto an electrophilic Se IV <lb/>species.Further investigations in this direction are underway <lb/>in our laboratory and will be reported in due course. <lb/></body>
