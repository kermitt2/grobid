			<body>Lithium ion batteries have become attractive for portable elec-<lb/>tronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers due to their<lb/> higher energy density compared to other rechargeable systems.<lb/> However, the high cost, toxicity, and safety issues associated with<lb/> the currently used layered LiCoO 2 cathode remain as an impediment<lb/> for employing the lithium ion battery technology for electric ve-<lb/>hicles EV and hybrid electric vehicles HEV. In this regard, spinel<lb/> LiMn 2 O 4 is appealing as Mn is inexpensive and environmentally<lb/> benign and the Mn 3+/4+ couple is chemically more stable with good<lb/> safety characteristics compared to the Co 3+/4+ couple. Also, the high<lb/> rate capability of spinel oxides makes them attractive for EV and<lb/> HEV applications.<lb/> However, LiMn 2 O 4 is plagued by severe capacity fade at el-<lb/>evated temperatures. The capacity fade has been attributed to several<lb/> mechanisms such as the formation of tetragonal Li 2 Mn 2 O 4 on the<lb/> surface due to Jahn–Teller distortion at the end of discharge, 1-3 elec-<lb/>trochemical reaction with the electrolyte at high voltages, 4,5 loss of<lb/> crystallinity during cycling, 6,7 cation mixing between the lithium<lb/> and manganese sites in the spinel lattice, 8 formation of<lb/> oxygen-deficiency, 9 formation of two cubic phases with a large dif-<lb/>ference in lattice parameter during the charge–discharge<lb/> process, 10-13 instability of the two-phase structure in the charged<lb/> state resulting in a loss of MnO to form a more stable single-phase<lb/> structure, 14-17 and manganese dissolution from the lattice into the<lb/> electrolyte due to the disproportionation of Mn 3+ into Mn 2+ and<lb/> Mn 4+  caused by trace amounts of hydrofluoric acid HF present in<lb/> the electrolyte. 18-24 Among them, manganese dissolution is generally<lb/> thought to be the most important factor causing the capacity fade.<lb/> Several approaches such as cationic substitutions, 7,11-14,17 anionic<lb/> substitutions, 25 and surface treatments 23,24,26 have been found to<lb/> suppress the capacity fade at elevated temperatures. However, a sys-<lb/>tematic, clear relationship or correlation of the electrochemical per-<lb/>formance to the amount of manganese dissolution is lacking in the<lb/> literature. With an aim to develop a better understanding of the<lb/> influence of metal ion dissolution on electrochemical properties, we<lb/> present here a comparison of the transition metal ion dissolution<lb/> from various cathode materials: layered, orthorhombic LiMnO 2 , 4 V<lb/> spinel, 5 V spinel, and olivine oxides. Also, the dependence of man-<lb/>ganese dissolution on Mn 3+ vs Mn 4+ content is investigated. Fur-<lb/>thermore, from a systematic investigation of a number of cationic<lb/> and anionic substituted spinel oxides, a correlation of manganese<lb/> dissolution to i the lattice parameter difference between the two<lb/> cubic phases formed during the charge–discharge process and ii<lb/> capacity retention are presented.<lb/> Experimental<lb/> LiCoO 2 was prepared by firing stoichiometric amounts of<lb/> Li 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 at 900°C for 24 h in air. Layered<lb/> LiNi 0.5−y Mn 0.5−y Co 2y O 2 0  2y  0.58 in which Ni, Mn, and Co<lb/> exist as Ni 2+ , Mn 4+ , and Co 3+ were synthesized by firing the copre-<lb/>cipitated hydroxides of Mn, Co, and Ni with lithium hydroxide at<lb/> 900°C for 24 h in air. 27 Orthorhombic LiMnO 2 and layered<lb/> LiMn 0.8 Cr 0.2 O 2 monoclinic were synthesized by firing required<lb/> amounts of Li 2 CO 3 , Mn 2 O 3 , and Cr 2 O 3 at 1000°C in N 2<lb/> atmosphere. 28 The 4 V spinel LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  M = Al, Ti,<lb/> Ni, and Cu oxides were synthesized by firing required amounts of<lb/> Li 2 CO 3 , Mn 2 O 3 , Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , NiO, CuO, and LiF at 800°C for<lb/> 48 h in air. The 5 V spinel LiMn 1.5 Ni 0.5 O 4 oxide and its derivatives<lb/> in which manganese exists as Mn 4+ were synthesized by firing the<lb/> coprecipitated metal hydroxides with a required amount of lithium<lb/> hydroxide at 900°C for 12 h in air. 29 Olivine LiFePO 4 was prepared<lb/> by firing required amounts of Li 2 CO 3 , FeCH 3 COO 2 , and<lb/> NH 4 H 2 PO 4 in N 2 atmosphere first at 320°C for 3 h and then at<lb/> 700°C for 10 h with an intermittent grinding.<lb/> Because fluorine is volatile at higher temperatures, the fluorine<lb/> content in the synthesized samples were calculated based on the<lb/> experimentally determined lithium content and average oxidation<lb/> state of the transition metal ions, employing charge neutrality prin-<lb/>ciple, and assuming the total anion O + F content to be 4.0. The<lb/> lithium content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy<lb/> AAS and the oxidation state was determined by a redox titration<lb/> involving sodium oxalate and potassium permanganate. The error<lb/> bars in the lithium content and oxidation state values are, respec-<lb/>tively, ±0.01 and ±0.02. The amount of dissolved metal ion was<lb/> assessed by soaking the sample powders 50 mg in the electrolyte<lb/> 10 mL containing 1 M LiPF 6 in 1:1 ethylene carbonate EC and<lb/> diethyl carbonate DEC at 55°C for 7 days, followed by determin-<lb/>ing the amount of metal ion in the electrolyte with AAS. The error<lb/> bar in the % Mn dissolution values is ±0.1%. Chemical extraction of<lb/> lithium was carried out by stirring the LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  pow-<lb/>ders with an acetonitrile solution of the oxidizer NO 2 BF 4 for 2 days<lb/> under argon atmosphere, followed by washing the products with<lb/> acetonitrile and drying under vacuum. 30 Lattice parameters of the<lb/> chemically delithiated spinel oxide compositions were determined<lb/> by the Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction XRD data. 31<lb/> Electrochemical data were collected between 3.5 and 4.3 V at<lb/> both room temperature and 60°C with CR2032 coin cells that were<lb/> fabricated with metallic lithium anode, 1 M LiPF 6 in EC-DEC 1:1<lb/></body>

			<body>electrolyte, Celgard polypropylene separator, and the cathodes. The<lb/> cathodes were prepared by mixing the LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  spi-<lb/>nel powder with 20 wt % conductive carbon and 5 wt % polytet-<lb/>rafluoroethylene PTFE binder, rolling the mixture into thin sheets,<lb/> and cutting into circular electrodes of 0.64 cm 2 area.<lb/> Results and Discussion<lb/> Table I compares the amount of transition metal ion Mn, Co, Ni,<lb/> and Fe dissolution from layered, orthorhombic LiMnO 2 , 4 V spi-<lb/>nel, 5 V spinel, and olivine oxides. The amounts of each dissolved<lb/> metal ion as well as the total dissolved transition metal ions are<lb/> expressed in % based on the sample weight. Layered LiCoO 2 that is<lb/> currently used in lithium ion cells exhibits a low cobalt dissolution<lb/> of 0.8%. The layered LiNi 0.5−y Mn 0.5−y Co 2y O 2 oxides samples 2–7<lb/> in Table I in which manganese exists as Mn 4+ exhibit a total metal<lb/> ion dissolution of 0.9–1.8% and a manganese dissolution of 0.4%.<lb/> With these low to moderate total metal ion dissolution, these layered<lb/> oxides are known to exhibit good capacity retention. 27 In contrast,<lb/> layered LiMn 0.8 Cr 0.2 O 2 sample 8 in Table I and orthorhombic<lb/> LiMnO 2 sample 9 in Table I in which manganese exists as Mn 3+<lb/> exhibit a high manganese dissolution of 2.6–3.2%. Similarly,<lb/> LiMn 2 O 4 spinel sample 10 in Table I in which manganese exists as<lb/> Mn 3.5+ shows a high manganese dissolution of 3.2%. Interestingly,<lb/> the 5 V spinels based on LiMn 1.5 Ni 0.5 O 4 samples 11–14 in Table I<lb/> in which manganese exists as Mn 4+ exhibit a much lower total metal<lb/> ion dissolution of 0.3–0.7% compared to LiMn 2 O 4 . The data reveal<lb/> that the presence of Mn 3+ leads to a significantly larger amount of<lb/> manganese dissolution compared to Mn 4+ due to the disproportion-<lb/>ation of Mn 3+ to Mn 2+ and Mn 4+ . 18 The data also confirm that the<lb/> poor elevated temperature capacity retention of LiMn 2 O 4 spinel<lb/> compared to the 5 V spinels is due to the larger degree of manga-<lb/>nese dissolution. For a comparison, the olivine LiFePO 4 also shows<lb/> a low metal ion dissolution of 0.5%.<lb/> Recognizing that the larger manganese dissolution leads to poor<lb/> capacity retention with the LiMn 2 O 4 spinel oxide, we have focused<lb/> on a systematic investigation of the amount of manganese dissolu-<lb/>tion from several cation substituted LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4 oxides and<lb/> fluorine-substituted LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  oxyfluorides. Table II<lb/> compares the percent manganese dissolution based on both the<lb/> sample weight and the Mn weight. While the unsubstituted<lb/> LiMn 2 O 4 exhibits a high manganese dissolution of 3.2% based on<lb/> sample weight, cationic substitutions for Mn suppress the manga-<lb/>nese dissolution. However, while certain cationic substitutions such<lb/> as LiMn 1.95 Li 0.05 O 4 and LiMn 1.88 Al 0.12 O 4 suppress the manganese<lb/> dissolution only moderately to 2.7% based on sample weight,<lb/> others such<lb/> as LiMn 1.88 Li 0.06 Ni 0.03 Al 0.03 O 4<lb/> and LiMn 1.85 Li 0.075 Ni 0.075 O 4 suppress it significantly to 1.5% based<lb/> on sample weight.<lb/> It is interesting to note that there is no clear correlation<lb/> between the extent of cationic substitution and the percent<lb/> manganese dissolution. For example, LiMn 1.88 Al 0.12 O 4 and<lb/> LiMn 1.88 Li 0.06 Ni 0.03 Al 0.03 O 4 having the same degree of cationic sub-<lb/>stitution 0.12 or Mn 1.88 M 0.12  differ significantly in the amount of<lb/> manganese dissolution 2.6 vs 1.3% based on sample weight. Fur-<lb/>thermore, with a given cationic substitution, the anionic substitution<lb/> of fluorine for oxygen decreases the amount of manganese dissolu-<lb/>tion further, possibly due to a more ionic, stronger Mn–F bond<lb/> compared to the Mn–O bond and surface passivation by the<lb/> fluoride ions. For example, LiMn 1.85 Li 0.075 Ni 0.075 O 4 and<lb/> LiMn 1.85 Li 0.075 Ni 0.075 O 3.94 F 0.06 exhibit manganese dissolutions of,<lb/> respectively, 1.5 and 1.1% based on sample weight. The manga-<lb/>nese dissolution based on Mn weight in Table II also shows a trend<lb/> similar to that found based on sample weight. Although one may<lb/> suspect the particle size and surface area to influence the manganese<lb/> dissolution, all the spinel samples presented in Table II had similar<lb/> morphology, particle size 2–6 m, and crystallite size<lb/> 60–85 nm as indicated by scanning electron microscopy SEM<lb/> and XRD data.<lb/> Figure 1 compares the cyclability data at 25 and 60°C of some<lb/> selected spinel oxide and oxyfluoride samples, and Table II gives the<lb/> % capacity loss after 50 cycles at 25 and 60°C. The cationic substi-<lb/>tutions in general improve the capacity retention, but some cationic<lb/> substitutions are more effective than others. For example, with the<lb/> same amount of cationic substitution 0.12, LiMn 1.88 Al 0.12 O 4 ,<lb/> LiMn 1.88 Li 0.06 Cu 0.06 O 4 , and LiMn 1.88 Li 0.06 Ni 0.03 Al 0.03 O 4 exhibit<lb/> capacity fades of, respectively, 27.2, 9.3, and 3.6% in 50<lb/> cycles at 60°C. Furthermore, with a given cationic substitution,<lb/> the fluorine substitution offers further improvement in capacity<lb/> retention.<lb/> For example,<lb/> LiMn 1.85 Li 0.075 Ni 0.075 O 4<lb/> and LiMn 1.85 Li 0.075 Ni 0.075 O 3.94 F 0.06 exhibit capacity fades of, respec-<lb/>tively, 3.2 and 2.4% in 50 cycles at 60°C. Interestingly, the capacity<lb/> fade bears a clear relationship to manganese dissolution Table II; it<lb/> decreases with decreasing amount of manganese dissolution, con-<lb/>firming the widespread belief of manganese dissolution as a capacity<lb/> fade mechanism in the literature. 18-24<lb/> In order to identify and understand the basic materials param-<lb/>eters and characteristics that may influence the degree of manganese<lb/> dissolution and capacity fade, we first correlate in Fig. 2 the initial<lb/> manganese valence in the samples to the capacity fade after<lb/> 50 cycles at 60°C, % manganese dissolution, and the lattice param-<lb/>

It is known that the manganese spinel oxides<lb/> encounter the formation of two cubic phases during the charge–<lb/> discharge process 12,16,17,32 as indicated by a clear splitting of the<lb/> reflections of, for example, Li 0.34 Mn 2 O 4 in Fig. 3. Although such a<lb/> splitting decreases with cationic and anionic substitutions as seen in<lb/> Fig. 3 for other compositions due to a smaller a, the broad peaks<lb/> could be resolved by Rietveld analysis and the lattice parameters for<lb/> the two cubic phases could be obtained. The a values thus ob-<lb/>tained are plotted against the initial Mn valence in Fig. 2c.

While samples with an initial manganese valence of<lb/> 3.6+ show a low and nearly constant capacity fade, manganese<lb/> dissolution, and a, those with a manganese valence of 3.6+ show<lb/> an increase in capacity fade, manganese dissolution, and a with<lb/> decreasing manganese valence, which is in accordance with our pre-<lb/>vious finding with some oxide compositions. 13<lb/> To develop a further understanding, Fig. 4 relates the lattice pa-<lb/>rameter difference a between the two cubic phases formed during<lb/> the charge–discharge process as well as the corresponding % vol-<lb/>ume change V to the capacity fade after 50 cycles at 25°C. Figure<lb/> 4 also plots the lattice parameter difference a between the fully<lb/> charged and discharged states. Clearly, the capacity fade decreases<lb/> with decreasing a, V, and a as we have found before with<lb/> some oxide compositions. 12,13 Figure 5 shows the correlation of ca-<lb/>pacity fade after 50 cycles at 60°C to the lattice parameter differ-<lb/>ence a between the two cubic phases and the amount of manga-<lb/>nese dissolution. The capacity fade decreases with decreasing a<lb/> and manganese dissolution, suggesting a relationship between a<lb/> and manganese dissolution. Figure 6 plots a vs manganese disso-<lb/>lution, and the samples with a smaller amount of manganese disso-<lb/>lution also exhibit a smaller a. This is consistent with a report by<lb/> Xia et al. 14 that the two-phase structure in the charged state results in<lb/> the loss of MnO from the lattice. The results thus demonstrate that<lb/> the capacity fade decreases with decreasing manganese dissolution,<lb/> which in turn exhibits a clear relationship to a. In this regard, the<lb/> a value may be used as a parameter to rapidly assess the capacity<lb/> retention behavior and thereby screen the spinel oxide cathode com-<lb/>positions instead of carrying out the extensive, time-consuming cy-<lb/>cling tests.<lb/> An interesting aspect in Fig. 4-6 and in Table II is the influence<lb/> of cationic and anionic substitutions in the LiMn 2 O 4 spinel lattice.<lb/> Some of the data points in Fig. 4-6 are numbered, which refer to the<lb/> sample numbers in Table II. While the unsubstituted LiMn 2 O 4 ex-<lb/>hibits a high a, manganese dissolution, and capacity fade, the cat-<lb/>ionic substitutions in general decrease them, with some substitutions<lb/> Figure 3.

			much more effective than others. With a given cationic substitution,<lb/> the anionic fluorine substitution decreases them further, resulting in<lb/> a superior capacity retention for cation-substituted oxyfluorides.<lb/> Conclusions<lb/> The transition metal ion dissolutions from layered, orthorhombic<lb/> LiMnO 2 , 4 V spinel, 5 V spinel, and olivine LiFePO 4 cathodes have<lb/> been investigated systematically. The cathodes containing Mn 3+ lead<lb/> to a larger amount of manganese dissolution than the total metal ion<lb/> dissolution found from cathodes containing Mn 4+ or from LiCoO 2<lb/> and LiFePO 4 . However, the amount of manganese dissolution from<lb/> the Mn 3+ -containing spinel cathodes could be reduced significantly<lb/> through cationic and anionic substitutions. The reduction of manga-<lb/>nese dissolution in such LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  spinels can be at-<lb/>tained through much smaller lattice parameter difference a be-<lb/>tween the two cubic phases formed during the charge–discharge<lb/> process. The reduced manganese dissolution leads to excellent ca-<lb/>pacity retention at elevated temperatures for cathode compositions<lb/> such as LiMn 2−y−z Li y M z O 4− F  . Furthermore, the manganese disso-<lb/>lution bears a relationship to the lattice parameter difference a<lb/> between the two cubic phases formed during the charge–discharge<lb/> process. The study demonstrates that reduction in the amount of<lb/> manganese dissolution and a lowering of a by appropriate cationic<lb/> and anionic substitutions may be an effective way to overcome the<lb/> difficulties of employing the manganese spinel cathodes for EV and<lb/> HEV applications.<lb/>
