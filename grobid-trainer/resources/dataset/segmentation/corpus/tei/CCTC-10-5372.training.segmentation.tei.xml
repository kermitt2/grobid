			<front>Ligand Migration from Cluster to Support: A Crucial Factor <lb/>for Catalysis by Thiolate-protected Gold Clusters <lb/>Bei Zhang, [a] Annelies Sels, [a] Giovanni Salassa, [a] Stephan Pollitt, [b] Vera Truttmann, [b] <lb/>Christoph Rameshan, [b] Jordi Llorca, [c] Wojciech Olszewski, [d, e] Günther Rupprechter, [b] <lb/>Thomas Bürgi,* [a] and Noelia Barrabés* [b] <lb/>

			Thiolate protected metal clusters are valuable precursors for the <lb/>design of tailored nanosized catalysts. Their performance can <lb/>be tuned precisely at atomic level, e. g. by the configuration/ <lb/>type of ligands or by partial/complete removal of the ligand <lb/>shell through controlled pre-treatment steps. However, the <lb/>interaction between the ligand shell and the oxide support, as <lb/>well as ligand removal by oxidative pre-treatment, are still <lb/>poorly understood. Typically, it was assumed that the thiolate <lb/>ligands are simply converted into SO 2 , CO 2 and H 2 O. Herein, we <lb/>report the first detailed observation of sulfur ligand migration <lb/>from Au to the oxide support upon deposition and oxidative <lb/>pre-treatment, employing mainly S K-edge XANES. Conse-<lb/>quently, thiolate ligand migration not only produces clean Au <lb/>cluster surfaces but also the surrounding oxide support is <lb/>modified by sulfur-containing species, with pronounced effects <lb/>on catalytic properties. <lb/></front>

			<body>Small metal nanoparticles and clusters are well known for their <lb/>high catalytic activity. [1] Nanoscale particles can be stabilized by <lb/>protecting ligands and support materials, both having a strong <lb/>influence on their catalytic properties. [2] <lb/>Typical synthetic procedures involve the use of ligands for <lb/>obtaining a defined particle size, shape and structure. To <lb/>improve their stability during catalytic applications, the ligand-<lb/>protected clusters are supported on different oxide materials. <lb/>However, strongly coordinating ligands may block the active Au <lb/>sites and/or alter their electronic properties. [2c] Therefore, differ-<lb/>ent treatments [3] are typically applied to remove the protecting <lb/>ligands, assuming complete removal of the ligands via gas <lb/>phase SO 2 , CO 2 and H 2 O. Previous thermal activation studies of <lb/>ligand-protected metal clusters have focused on alterations of <lb/>size and structure upon different treatments. [4] The exact fate of <lb/>the thiolate ligands was not considered so far. <lb/>Thiolate protected Au nanoclusters in the size range from <lb/>sub-nanometer to 2 nm have shown extraordinary catalytic <lb/>selectivity and activity, which depends on their size [5] and <lb/>structure. [6] Au nanoclusters are composed of a dense gold core <lb/>and protecting S-(AuÀ S) n (n = 1, 2) units (staples). [7] Supported <lb/>Au clusters were shown to be active for several reactions, such <lb/>as CO oxidation, [8] cyclohexane [5b,9] aerobic alcohol [10] and <lb/>styrene oxidation. [11] It has been observed that the thiolate <lb/>ligands play an essential role [2c] in the catalytic activity of Au <lb/>nanoclusters in gas [8b] and liquid phase [10] reactions. The ligand <lb/>coverage around the Au cluster core affects the activity and <lb/>selectivity, which has been ascribed to electronic and steric <lb/>effects, but this has been controversially discussed. <lb/>Supported ligand protected clusters (Au x (SR) y /CeO 2 , x = 25, <lb/>38 and 144), were found to be active in reactions such as CO <lb/>oxidation, even without removing any ligands. [8a,12] For <lb/>Au 25 (SR) 18 /CeO 2 , it was reported that the thiol ligands acted as a <lb/>double-edged sword, stabilizing on the one hand the Au cluster <lb/>structure but on the other hand blocking CO adsorption on Au <lb/>sites. [8b] Therefore, a partial removal of thiolate ligands was <lb/>typically required for CO oxidation. [8b] In the case of liquid phase <lb/>aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, Au 25 (SC 12 H 25 ) 18 supported <lb/>on porous carbon nanosheets showed no activity with the <lb/>complete ligand shell, but only when the ligands were partly <lb/>removed. The ligand coverage also affects selectivity, since <lb/>thiolates reduce the oxidation ability of Au by withdrawing <lb/>electrons, but also by inducing site isolation. [10] <lb/>Despite the well-documented importance of ligand removal <lb/>for catalyst activation, the exact reaction pathways have not yet <lb/>been considered in detail. As mentioned, it was assumed that <lb/>the ligands are removed to the gas phase and their fate has <lb/>been completely neglected up to now. [13] <lb/></body>

			<body>S K-edge XAFS was used in this work to directly follow the <lb/>evolution of the thiolate ligands upon Au 38 (SR) 24 cluster <lb/>deposition on CeO 2 . Clear evidence of ligand migration from <lb/>the gold cluster to the support was obtained, manifested by <lb/>formation of unexpected oxidized sulfur species on the support. <lb/>The detected SO x compounds increased and evolved upon <lb/>thermal treatments. The redistribution and oxidation of the <lb/>ligands modified the surface, a factor that can alter the catalyst <lb/>properties. It may explain the different catalytic performances <lb/>depending on the degree of ligand removal in different <lb/>reactions. [8a,b,9,10,12] In our previous work on supported Au 38 (SR) 24 <lb/>clusters, unexpected cyclohexanethiol was obtained among the <lb/>products of cyclohexane oxidation. [9] The only possible source <lb/>of sulfur in the reaction media were the cluster ligands, thus <lb/>clearly evidencing the active role of the thiolate ligands in the <lb/>reaction. [9] Figure 1 shows S K-edge (2472 eV) XAFS spectra of <lb/>Au 38 (SR) 24 clusters supported on CeO 2 . Identification of the S <lb/>species in the samples was carried out by comparing the XANES <lb/>spectra with S reference compounds (oxidation states: À 1, 0, <lb/>+ 3, + 4 and + 6, Figure 1b). Unsupported Au 38 (SR) 24 clusters <lb/>were also measured as reference, showing a pre-edge feature at <lb/>2471 eV related to SÀ Au bonds and a SÀ C peak at 2473 eV, in <lb/>agreement with previously reported measurements. [14] <lb/>Once the clusters are supported on CeO 2 , the SÀ Au to SÀ C <lb/>peak intensity decreases, indicating partial detachment of <lb/>thiolate ligands from the Au nanoclusters. In addition, unex-<lb/>pected peaks between 2478 and 2486 eV appeared, related to S <lb/>species in high oxidation states (disulfide, SO 3 <lb/>2À and SO 4 <lb/>2À ). The <lb/>only possible source of S are the thiolate ligands, denoting <lb/>ligand migration to the oxide material upon supporting. Both <lb/>atmospheric and support lattice oxygen may contribute to the <lb/>formation of these high oxidation state S species. The peak <lb/>close to 2476 eV could be attributed to adsorbed disulfides on <lb/>Ce atoms, based on previous reports, [15] whereas the SÀ O peaks <lb/>at 2478 and 2481 eV are due to SO 3 <lb/>2À and SO 4 <lb/>2À . [15a,16] Different <lb/>interactions between the ligands and support sites lead to <lb/>these distinct oxidized S species. The SR/CeO 2 reference spectra <lb/>in Figure 1a (2472 eV due to SÀ Ce bond) confirmed this picture. <lb/>In this case, the ligand phenylethanethiol (SHC 2 H 4 Ph) was <lb/>deposited on CeO 2 as blank sample. Comparing the spectra of <lb/>the supported and unsupported ligands (Figs. 1a,b), new bands <lb/>in the region around 2478 and 2482 eV, characteristic of SÀ O <lb/>bonds, emerged upon supporting. Furthermore, different <lb/>double peaks appeared at the white-line, characteristic of <lb/>thiosulfates, organic disulfides, etc., related to 1 s transitions in <lb/>SÀ C or SÀ H bonds. A clear white-line shift to lower energy also <lb/>occurred upon supporting the ligand, which may be attributed <lb/>to SÀ Ce interaction. Thus, this represents the first direct <lb/>evidence of the redistribution of S species between gold and <lb/>metal oxide upon supporting the clusters, an effect that has <lb/>completely been neglected up to now. <lb/>Deposition on Al 2 O 3 , another frequently used support <lb/>material, was also studied, leading to different SO x species. For <lb/>Au 38 (SR) 24 /Al 2 O 3 , SÀ O peaks at 2482 and 2498 eV were found, <lb/>denoting the presence of SO 3 <lb/>2À <lb/>and SO 4 <lb/>2À <lb/>(Figure S3). The <lb/>interactions of sulfur compounds with oxides such as Al 2 O 3 and <lb/>CeO 2 are relevant for catalyst poisoning or desulfurization <lb/>processes. [17] <lb/>The reactivity of S-containing molecules on oxides was <lb/>found to be linked to properties such as acidity-basicity, pore <lb/>structure, band gaps, and oxygen vacancies. [17c] The efficiency to <lb/>oxidize various aromatic and heterocyclic thiols to disulfides <lb/>increases upon addition of Au nanoparticles. [17d] This may be <lb/>related to the strong interaction of the thiol ligands with the <lb/>oxide support, as observed by the S K-edge measurements. <lb/>The evolution of the S species upon thermal treatment was <lb/>followed by S K-edge XANES (Figure 2). Increasing the temper-<lb/>ature, thiolate ligands detached from the Au clusters and the <lb/>ligand carbon backbone broke, resulting in the decrease of the <lb/>peaks between 2471 and 2475 eV (SÀ C). This is in agreement <lb/>with our previous Au L 3 -edge EXAFS experiments, in which <lb/>AuÀ S bonds clearly decreased during thermal treatments <lb/>(whereas the Au core structure was maintained (Figure S4)). [9] <lb/>The sulfur oxide species increased (2478-2482 eV) and further <lb/>oxidation to SO 4 <lb/>2À took place, as evidenced by the increase and <lb/>Figure 1. a: XANES spectra at S K-edge of Au 38 /CeO 2 catalysts, the <lb/>unsupported cluster Au 38 (SC 2 H 4 Ph) 18 and the thiol ligand supported on CeO 2 <lb/>are also included as references; b: XANES spectra at S K-edge of different <lb/>reference materials for comparison. <lb/></body>

			<body>shift to higher energies of the peak around 2480 eV. An attempt <lb/>to estimate the amount of species at every step was performed <lb/>using reference compounds. Qualitative linear combination was <lb/>done. The analysis is complicated by the double peaks and <lb/>shoulders at the white-line, which may induce considerable <lb/>errors in quantification. The general tendency is displayed in <lb/>Figure S5, with the main component SO 3 <lb/>2À <lb/>decreasing and <lb/>turning into SO 4 <lb/>2À . The contribution of Au 38 (SR) 24 has a major <lb/>drop from 150 °C to 250 °C, associated with the breaking SÀ Au <lb/>bonds. At the same time, the SR/CeO 2 portion just shows a <lb/>slight decrease. <lb/>STEM-HAADF with EDX analysis of Au 38 (SR) 24 /CeO 2 pre-<lb/>treated in O 2 at 150 °C was performed to determine micro-<lb/>structure and surface composition (Figure 3). The ceria support <lb/>crystallites exhibited a fairly wide distribution of sizes, ranging <lb/>approximately from 10 to 50 nm. Given the high atomic <lb/>number of Ce and the small size of the Au nanoclusters, clear <lb/>discrimination was not obtained. In addition, due to the small <lb/>dimensions of the Au nanoclusters (around 1 nm) and their <lb/>high dispersion over the ceria support, EDX spectra from a <lb/>single Au cluster could not be obtained. The EDX spectrum <lb/>recorded over the ceria support areas (Figure 3a) did not show <lb/>S. In contrast, the EDX spectrum of areas containing Au clusters <lb/>(Figure 3b) revealed the presence of S, confirming that S is <lb/>located near the Au clusters. <lb/>Figure 4 shows the XPS spectra of Au 4 f/2 and S 2p regions <lb/>(including peak fitting) of Au 38 (SR) 24 /CeO 2 after 150 °C pretreat-<lb/>ment. The Au 4 f 7/2 signal at 84.6 eV can be attributed to <lb/>metallic gold, with its binding energy being around ~0.6 eV <lb/>higher than that of bulk metallic Au. [18] Huang et al. reported <lb/>similar binding energies for Au nanoclusters supported on <lb/>ceria. [19] Also, Zhang et al. showed that for Au n (SR) m nano-<lb/>particles of decreasing size, the Au 4 f peaks shifted to higher <lb/>binding energy, [20] resulting from a nanosize effect and from <lb/>surface metal À ligand interactions. [20] In the S 2p spectra <lb/>(Figure 4), two components at 161.3 and 167.4 eV were present. <lb/>The peak at 161.3 eV can be attributed to the SÀ Au bond, in <lb/>agreement with values for metal sulfides [21] or with the SÀ Au <lb/>bond in self-assembled monolayers. [22] The peak at 167.4 eV is <lb/>assigned to fully oxidized sulfur, consistent with the observation <lb/>of SO 3 <lb/>2À and SO 4 <lb/>2À by XANES. This also agrees with XPS results <lb/>of Devillers et al., who reported oxidation of sulfur of self-<lb/>assembled monolayers in an oxygen environment. [23] Pookpan-<lb/>ratana et al. also reported fully oxidized sulfur at rather high <lb/>binding energies of ~168.6 eV. [24] <lb/>The migration and redistribution of S species, as reported <lb/>here, strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions (and <lb/>type of oxide support) and play an important role in catalysis. <lb/>Thus, we anticipate a complex behavior of selectivity resulting <lb/>from the evolution of S species as a function of pretreatment <lb/>and during catalysis. This was already observed in our previous <lb/>studies on cyclohexane oxidation, [9] which indicated a strong <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>dependence of selectivity on the pretreatment conditions. The <lb/>redistribution of S species may affect the oxidation reaction <lb/>possibly in two ways: 1) direct participation of the S species <lb/>adsorbed on the support in the reaction, 2) poisoning of <lb/>catalytically active sites on the support surface and affecting <lb/>the charge transfer between support and nanocluster. <lb/>The adsorption of sulfur species (either on metal sites or <lb/>oxygen vacancies) changes the charge distribution on the <lb/>surface, which is an important factor for the activation of O 2 . Jin <lb/>and coworkers, for example, reported an enhanced catalytic <lb/>activity of Au 38 (SR) 24 /CeO 2 catalyst in CO oxidation by increasing <lb/>the Ce 3 + /Ce 4 + ratio of the support. [8b,12,25] Recently, when <lb/>comparing different bulky thiol ligands, differences in catalytic <lb/>activity were ascribed just to interface effects, but without <lb/>giving further details. [26] This clearly shows the importance of <lb/>the support electron density on catalysis and underlines the <lb/>importance of our finding. The thiol migration and formation of <lb/>oxidized sulfur species certainly changes the electron density <lb/>on the support. Indeed, perspective review publications have <lb/>highlighted the need to better understand the important ligand <lb/>effects on the structure and catalytic properties of supported <lb/>metal clusters. [1b,27] <lb/>In summary, we have shown that upon supporting thiolate <lb/>protected gold clusters, the thiolates are redistributed between <lb/>cluster and support, leading to oxidized sulfur species that alter <lb/>the electronic and adsorption properties of the support <lb/>(Scheme 1). This effect has completely been neglected up to <lb/>now but we believe that it must be taken into account to fully <lb/>understand the complex selectivity patterns of supported <lb/>thiolate-protected clusters in catalysis. <lb/>Experimental Section <lb/>Synthesis of Au 38 /M x O y catalysts. Thermally treated Au 38 /M x O y were <lb/>prepared as described in the previous report. [9] Au 38 (SC 2 H 4 Ph) 24 is <lb/>denoted as Au 38 (SR) 24 . Detailed description of the cluster synthesis, <lb/>catalysts preparation and characterization can be found in the <lb/>Supporting Information <lb/>XAFS studies. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements <lb/>at the S K-edge (2.4720 keV) and Au L 3 -edge (11.9187 keV) were <lb/>carried out at the BL22-CLAESS beamline at the ALBA synchrotron <lb/>(Barcelona, Spain) for fresh, thermally pretreated and used catalysts. <lb/>The samples were prepared as 5 mm pellets and mounted on the <lb/>beamline sample holder. Measurements at both S K-edge and Au <lb/>L 3 -edge were performed in fluorescence mode under vacuum and <lb/>low temperature conditions (liquid nitrogen T � 80 K). Sulfur <lb/>reference compounds (sulfur, sulfone, Na 2 SO 3 , Na 2 SO 4 , correspond-<lb/>ing oxidation states: 0, + 3, + 4, and + 6; and Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 <lb/>supported phenylethanethiol) were also measured. Additional XAFS <lb/>measurements at Au L 3 -edge for selected CeO 2 supported catalysts <lb/>were carried out at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light <lb/>Source (Villigen, Switzerland). Fluorescence signal was detected <lb/>with a five-element SDD detector (SGX). The powder samples were <lb/>placed in a quartz capillary and cooled down with a cryo-gun to <lb/>liquid nitrogen temperature. The data analysis was performed <lb/>according to standard procedures using Ifeffit software. [28] <lb/></body>
