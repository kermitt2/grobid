Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have caught <lb/>extensive attention in the field of material science and electronics. <lb/>Their formation typically uses plasma arc or CVD techniques <lb/>[1Ϫ3]. So far, formation of SWCNTs just by thermal conversion <lb/>of amorphous, non graphitic carbon which is a nearly ubiquitous <lb/>carbon source is challenging but has not been reported so far.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>It is well known that amorphous carbon, upon heat treat-<lb/>ment (2500°Ϫ3500°C), undergoes crystallization forming <lb/>graphite [4]. Addition of alkaline or alkaline earth metals <lb/>catalyze this process, resulting into faster graphitization at <lb/>lower temperature. <lb/>The role of metallic nickel in graphitizing thin films of <lb/>amorphous carbon at 1000°C has also been reported [5]. <lb/>Along the same route, the metal combination nickel/yttrium <lb/>plays a crucial role in the catalyzed growth of SWNTs and <lb/>its influence has been studied experimentally and theoreti-<lb/>cally [6Ϫ8]. It has been speculated that the degree of carbon <lb/>solubility in the catalyst is a major criterion for a metal to <lb/>catalyze growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [7, 8]. If this <lb/>criterion is satisfied experimentally, amorphous carbon <lb/>(charcoal) could be used as a convenient carbon source to <lb/>grow SWCNTs. So far, to the best of our knowledge this <lb/>hypothesis has not been proven experimentally and the di-<lb/>rect catalytically driven conversion of amorphous carbon <lb/>over metals into SWCNTs is not known. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Separate samples of amorphous carbon were mixed with <lb/>Yttrium oxide and either metallic nickel or bis(η 5 -cyclopen-<lb/></body>

Bis(η 5 -cyclopentadienyl)-<lb/>nickel serves as an alternative source for metallic nickel <lb/>which is generated therefrom via thermal decomposition <lb/>[9]. Work reported herein is based on the phenomenon of <lb/>absorption and dissolution of amorphous carbon by metal <lb/>particles at high temperature followed by expulsion of gra-<lb/>phitic carboneous species therefrom when the saturation <lb/>limit of carbon in the catalyst particle is reached. <lb/>In a controlexperiment, plain activated charcoal powder, <lb/>without addition of any catalyst material, was heated to <lb/>1500°C. This leads to formation of disordered graphitic <lb/>structures. No formation of CNTs was observed under <lb/>these reaction conditions. Though graphitization had oc-<lb/>curred to a certain extent under these conditions, almost <lb/>the entire sample has been converted into glassy carbon <lb/>which is identified by a high intensity defect band in its <lb/>Raman spectrum (Fig 1a). The same morphology and ex-<lb/>tent of graphitization was found when the sample was <lb/>heated higher, up to 1800°C. <lb/>When amorphous carbon is heated with a mixture of <lb/>bis(η 5 -cyclopentadienyl)nickel and yttrium oxide as catalyst <lb/>up to 1500°C, a conversion of the carbon source into still <lb/>disordered graphitic material was observed as it was found <lb/>in the uncatalyzed reaction sample (Fig 2a). However, <lb/>when increasing the temperature further to 1800°C, <lb/>growth of bundles of SWCNTs was indeed observed <lb/>(Fig. 1b, Fig 2b). The inter layer spacing of the SWCNT <lb/>structures is more than the typical graphitic 0.34 nm spac-<lb/>ing, and is close to 1 nm while their length range in the <lb/>order of several nanometers.

The SAED pattern shows distinguished (002) spots and <lb/>a double hexagonal structure generated by electron diffrac-<lb/>tion from (hk0) plane. The smallest single walled nanotube <lb/>that has been observed in the present work has a diameter <lb/>of 0.57 nm, while the widest tube diameter observed was <lb/>1.3 nm. Interestingly catalyst particles formed at 1800°C <lb/>either from nickel metal/yttrium oxide or nickelocene/ <lb/>yttrium oxide, were often covered with a layer of graphite <lb/>(fig 3a and 3c). While synthesis temperatures of 1800°C <lb/>produced mainly SWCNTs, synthesis temperatures limited <lb/>up to 1500°C revealed the formation of mainly MWCNTs <lb/>(TEM analysis, no figure shown). <lb/>In a second control experiment we have treated a sample <lb/>of a purified carbon soot material which we have obtained <lb/>from a plasma arc discharge experiment under the same <lb/>catalytic conditions (catalyst system: metallic nickel, yttrium <lb/>oxide) [10]. Such a purified carbon soot contains mainly <lb/>multi walled CNTs.

			<body>The degree of graphitization of SWCNTs formed, was <lb/>evaluated by determining the ratio of the defect band (I D ) <lb/>to the graphitic band (I G ) [11]. The (I D /I G ) ratio is found to <lb/>be a maximum for a sample containing no catalyst (Fig.1a). <lb/>When the catalyst system metallic nickel/yttrium oxide was <lb/>used the (I D /I G ) ratio decreased drastically indicating good <lb/>graphitization of the CNTs. The degree of graphitization <lb/>was in the same range when nickelocene instead of metallic <lb/>nickel was used as Ni source in the catalyst system. <lb/>We observed different types of complex metallic in-<lb/>terphases formed from the catalyst precursor mixtures <lb/>Ni particles /yttrium oxide during CNT formation and charac-<lb/>terized them of situ via X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig.4). <lb/>Intermetallics of nickel and yttrium (Ni 2 Y 3 , Y 2 Ni 7 ) [12] as <lb/>well as nickel nitride Ni 3 N [13] and boron oxide (B 13 O 2 ϭ <lb/>B 12 (OBO) [13] could be identified. In addition to the gra-<lb/>phitic (002) peak of the CNTs a characteristic peak for the <lb/>formation of carbolite, a carbon allotrope composed of <lb/>macromolecular polyene chains [-CϵCϵC-] or cumulene <lb/>[-CϭCϭCϭC-] fragments, could be identified [15]. This <lb/>peak confirms the graphitization of amorphous carbon. No <lb/>further signals corresponding to yttrium oxide where found. <lb/></body>

			<body>In our reactions the rate of carbon absorption into the cata-<lb/>lyst particles was high, compared to the segregation rate <lb/>and was governed by an uniform cooling rate approaching <lb/>nearly isothermal conditions. This might lead to nucleation <lb/>of SWCNT embryos at numerous locations on the surface <lb/>of the catalyst particles. Three mechanistic scenarios have <lb/>been postulated for carbon segregation on a (111) metallic <lb/>nickel surface explaining graphitization at high tempera-<lb/>tures [18]. In the first scenario (i) a solid solution of catalyst <lb/>particle and carbon forms, in the second (ii) a graphitic <lb/>monolayer grown over the solid solution formed during <lb/>cooling of the complete reaction system. From this graphitic <lb/>monolayer an epitaxial onion like graphitic precipitate can <lb/>form in latter stages on the surface of the encapsulated catalyst <lb/>particles (iii). This may then preclude CNT growth. <lb/>We observed formation of numerous bundles of SWNTs in <lb/>our thermal synthesis process onto individual catalyst par-<lb/>ticles at 1800°C. Catalytic formation of SWNTs has indeed <lb/>be found to start at about 1227°C [19], which is 573°C <lb/>lower than our thermally activitated catalytic conversion <lb/>process of amorphous carbon. If nucleation of SWNT em-<lb/>bryos were formed before the reaction system reaches stage <lb/>(i), then an uniform growth of bundles of SWCNTs in dif-<lb/>ferent directions originating from the catalyst surface (so <lb/></body>

			<body>called sea urchin structure [8, 19]) will be formed. However, <lb/>no such structure could be detected in our samples by <lb/>TEM studies. <lb/>Our thermal reaction conditions employed obviously favor <lb/>the formation of stages (ii) and (iii), where catalyst particles <lb/>are completely surrounded by a thick graphitic layer (see <lb/>Fig. 3a). This dense, closed carbon graphene layer can pre-<lb/>clude formation of CNTs on the intermetallic catalyst par-<lb/>ticles [8, 20]. Even when only a mono-or multilayer of <lb/>graphite is formed over the catalyst particles, it precludes <lb/>CNT embryo formation from which typically any CNT <lb/>growth proceeds. In such a scenario CNT growth is then <lb/>only possible under two circumstances. First, either a sur-<lb/>factant, e.g. a rare earth metal Ϫ as it is present in our <lb/>process Ϫ alloys with the catalyst surface and avoids its <lb/>complete wetting by carbon. This could allow for CNT <lb/>growth in such non wetted areas were the catalyst particle&apos;s <lb/>surface is still accessible. In the case if no such surfactant <lb/>is available, further CNT growth is only possible if the <lb/>graphite monolayer is not completely closed at a constant <lb/>rate. This may be caused by a relative motion of catalyst <lb/>particle and monolayer carbon shell [20]. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>To conclude, we have shown that SWCNT formation is pos-<lb/>sible via a thermal, catalytically induced process starting <lb/>from amorphous charcoal powder (Aktivkohle). The active <lb/>catalyst particles are intermetallic phases of defined Ni x /Y y <lb/>composition. Since amorphous charcoal is an ubiquitous <lb/>carbon source our process provides an unique way for ob-<lb/>taining SWCNTs from this cheap and convenient source. <lb/>The studies show that under similar conditions no forma-<lb/>tion of SWCNTs from graphitic material e.g. MWCNTs <lb/>seems possible. Thus the carbon source obviously has to be <lb/>non graphitic to allow for efficient reactivity and dissol-<lb/>ution of carbon in the catalytic intermetallic particles. Our <lb/>active catalyst system contains a surfactant metal (Y) which <lb/>may preclude the complete surface wetting and thus the <lb/>deactivation of the catalyst particles by hindering the for-<lb/>mation of a completely closed carbon shell on the particles. <lb/>This assures that the growth process on the surface of the <lb/>catalyst particles is not arrested and leads to SWCNT for-<lb/>mation. <lb/>Experimental Section <lb/>Experiments were carried out in two individual sets, each at tem-<lb/>peratures of 1500°and 1800°C of four different samples (pellets <lb/>1Ϫ4) listed below. Metallic nickel (powder, 200 mesh, Merck) or <lb/>bis(η 5 -cyclopentadienyl)nickel and yttrium oxide (Aldrich) were <lb/>used as catalyst precursors.
