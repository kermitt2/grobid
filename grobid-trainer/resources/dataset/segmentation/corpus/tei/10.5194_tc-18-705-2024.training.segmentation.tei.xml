Organic peroxides (OPs) are an important component of dissolved organic matter (DOM), detected <lb/>in various aquatic media. Despite their unique functions as redox agents in water ecosystems, the complete <lb/>mechanisms and factors controlling their transformation are not explicitly established. Here, we evaluate the pH <lb/>effect on the aqueous-phase reaction of three selected OPs (methyl hydroperoxide (MHP), peracetic acid (PAA), <lb/>and benzoyl peroxide (BZP)) with dissolved SO 2 . Results show that due to the presence of the hydroperoxyl <lb/>group in their structures, MHP and PAA are susceptible to forming inorganic sulfate and organosulfate (methyl <lb/>sulfate for MHP and acetyl sulfate for PAA) depending on the pH, while BZP exclusively forms organosulfate <lb/>(benzoyl sulfate) in the pH range investigated. Moreover, it is seen that the ability of PAA to form inorganic <lb/>sulfate relative to organosulfate is more pronounced, which is supported by a previous experimental observation. <lb/>The effective rate constants of the transformation of these peroxides within the pH 1-10 and 240-340 K ranges <lb/>exhibit positive pH and temperature dependencies, and BZP is seen to degrade more effectively than MHP and <lb/>PAA. In addition to the pH impact, it is highlighted that the formation of organic and/or inorganic sulfate strongly <lb/>depends on the nature of the substituents on the peroxy function. Namely, PAA and BZP are more reactive than <lb/>MHP, which may be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effects of -C(O)R (R = -CH 3 and -C 6 H 5 for PAA and <lb/>BZP, respectively) substituents that activate the peroxy function. The results further indicate that the aqueous-<lb/>phase degradation of OPs can adequately drive the change in the chemical composition of DOM, both in terms <lb/>of organic and inorganic sulfate mass fractions. <lb/></front>

        <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Organic peroxides (OPs) are an important contributor to the <lb/>atmospheric oxidation capacity, as they act as reservoirs for <lb/>alkoxy radicals and organic peroxy radicals (RO x ) (Ehn et <lb/>al., 2014; Allen et al., 2022). Besides their well-known im-<lb/>plication in the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic com-<lb/>pounds and anthropogenic precursors, OPs were shown to <lb/>contribute to secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) by form-<lb/>ing an important link between sulfate and SOAs (Tkacik et <lb/>al., 2012; Riva et al., 2015; Hettiyadura et al., 2017; Huang et <lb/>al., 2020). Moreover, they are also known to regulate the dis-<lb/>tribution of HO x and RO x radicals through large-scale ver-<lb/>tical and horizontal transport (Mari et al., 2000; Ravetta et <lb/>al., 2001). OPs were ubiquitously detected in atmospheric <lb/>media, including air and precipitation, fresh water, seawater, <lb/>surface waters, and coastal environments (Sauer et al., 2001; <lb/>Morgan and Jackson, 2002; Sun et al., 2021). Their sources <lb/>are varied, depending on their chemical compositions and <lb/>properties (Liu et al., 2014). In aqueous media, these sources <lb/>include the self-reaction of photochemically formed organic <lb/>radicals and partitioning from the gas phase to the particle <lb/>phase (O&apos;Sullivan et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2021; Riemer et <lb/>al., 2000). <lb/>The primary sinks of OPs include SO 2 oxidation in cloud <lb/>and rain droplets and uptake on water surfaces and water ice, <lb/>mainly forming water-soluble organic compounds and sec-<lb/>ondary sulfates (Böge et al., 2006; Hua et al., 2008).

        <body>ous studies have indeed shown that OPs are highly reactive <lb/>towards dissolved SO 2 in submicron aerosol (O&apos;Sullivan et <lb/>al., 1996; Liou and Storz, 2010), despite the incomplete de-<lb/>tailed mechanisms and kinetics of their transformation. Such <lb/>reactions in the aqueous phase are known to be driven by <lb/>the change in solution pH. Specifically, bulk phase pH was <lb/>shown to impact the rates of multiphase SO 2 oxidation to-<lb/>wards aqueous-phase aerosol formation by altering the re-<lb/>actions mechanisms and modifying the particle morphology, <lb/>viscosity, and radiative effects (Turnock et al., 2019; Lei et <lb/>al., 2022). While some of these pH impacts have been ex-<lb/>plored in detail, namely altering the aerosol radiative forcing <lb/>(Turnock et al., 2019), the detailed effect on reaction mecha-<lb/>nisms and kinetics remains not fully elucidated. The lack of <lb/>comprehensive information on the pH impact on the mecha-<lb/>nisms and kinetics of OP reactions towards SO 2 hinders the <lb/>complete assessment of the importance of such interactions <lb/>in aquatic environments, for example in the chemical com-<lb/>position of dissolved organic matter (DOM). <lb/>Methyl hydroperoxide (MHP, CH 3 OOH), peracetic acid <lb/>(PAA, CH 3 C(O)OOH), and benzoyl peroxide (BZP, C 6 H 5 -<lb/>C(O)OO(O)C-C 6 H 5 ) are typical examples of OPs both from <lb/>natural and anthropogenic origins. MHP is the simplest and <lb/>most abundant OP in the atmosphere and is most preva-<lb/>lent in the remote marine environment (Heikes et al., 1996; <lb/>O&apos;Sullivan et al., 1999). MHP is believed to form from the <lb/>ozonolysis of alkenes and from biomass burning (Klippel et <lb/>al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). PAA is one of the simplest OPs <lb/>containing the carbonyl function, formed form the reaction <lb/>between acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of <lb/>a strong acid catalyst. PAA is widely used as a disinfectant, <lb/>sterilizing agent, oxidizer, polymerization catalyst, and sani-<lb/>tizer in wastewater treatment and various industrial applica-<lb/>tions and is known as a powerful degrading agent for aqueous <lb/>organic micropollutants (Luukkonen et al., 2015; Zhang and <lb/>Huang, 2020; Ao et al., 2021; Kiejza et al., 2021). BZP is an <lb/>antiseptic much used for acne treatment and in the chemical <lb/>industry (Kircik, 2013; Brammann and Mueller-Goymann, <lb/>2019). It can easily enter the human body via food intake <lb/>and skin absorption, causing potential risks such as tissue <lb/>damage and eventually acting as a tumor promoter (Kozan <lb/>et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2019). As a strong reactive oxygen <lb/>species, BZP can be reduced to benzoic acid, with the ability <lb/>to inhibit the growth of some microorganisms in wheat flour <lb/>and corn starch (Ding et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2022). Previous <lb/>studies also mentioned the possibility of BZP thermolysis to <lb/>yield benzoyloxy radicals and volatile benzene in the aque-<lb/>ous phase (Tu et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2023). <lb/>Despite MHP, PAA, and BZP being poorly soluble in wa-<lb/>ter compared to hydrogen peroxide, for example, they are <lb/>relatively present in aquatic media (Meylan and Howard, <lb/>1991; O&apos;Sullivan et al., 1996; Sun et al., 2021). Some studies <lb/>have investigated the chemistry of these OPs through particle <lb/>uptake, wet and dry deposition, thermal and photochemical <lb/>decomposition, and SO 2 oxidation (Tan et al., 2020; Xu et <lb/>al., 2021; Ignatov et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2022), yet there <lb/>are still deficiencies in understanding their full chemistry in <lb/>aquatic media. The current study applies quantum chemi-<lb/>cal calculation techniques to explore the aqueous-phase re-<lb/>actions of MHP, PAA, and BZP with dissolved SO 2 . The pH <lb/>effect on the mechanism and kinetics of these reactions is <lb/>evaluated, and their implication in altering the chemical com-<lb/>position of DOM is assessed. <lb/>2 Methods <lb/>2.1 Quantum chemical calculations <lb/>Geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency analy-<lb/>sis of all molecules and stationary points were performed <lb/>using density functional theory based on the ωB97XD/6-<lb/>31++G(d,p) method under the harmonic oscillator-rigid-<lb/>rotor approximation (Chai and Head-Gordon, 2008; Elm, <lb/>2022). This method has been shown to adequately describe <lb/>molecular clustering and reactions involving transition state <lb/>(TS) configurations (Elm et al., 2017; Elm, 2019). The <lb/>aqueous phase was modeled using the continuum solva-<lb/>tion model based on the solute electron density (SMD) at <lb/>the ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. This model, <lb/>based on an implicit treatment of the solvent, is adequate <lb/>for describing atmospheric processes (Ostovari et al., 2018; <lb/>Xu and Coote, 2019) and was shown to outperform ex-<lb/>plicit water treatment especially in resolving for energy bar-<lb/>riers (Chen et al., 2019). All ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) cal-<lb/>culations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package <lb/>(Frisch et al., 2013), while single-point energy corrections <lb/>on ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) structures were calculated with <lb/>the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ method using Orca ver-<lb/>sion 4.2.1 (Riplinger and Neese, 2013). The Gibbs free en-<lb/>ergy in the aqueous phase is calculated at standard conditions <lb/>(298.15 K and 1 M molar concentration). Details are given in <lb/>Sect. S1 in the Supplement. <lb/>2.2 Kinetics <lb/>The kinetic analysis was performed based on the tran-<lb/>sition state theory (Truhlar et al., 1996). The reac-<lb/>tion proceeds through collision between initial reac-<lb/>tants, i.e., dissolved SO 2 (henceforth, simply denoted as <lb/>S(IV) = SO 2 q H 2 O + HSO -<lb/>3 + SO 2-<lb/>3 ), and the organic per-<lb/>oxide (OP), to form the reactant complex (RC) in equilib-<lb/>rium with the initial reactants, followed by a rearrangement <lb/>through a TS configuration to form the product complex ac-<lb/>cording to the following reaction: <lb/>S(IV) + OP ↔ RC → TS → product complex . <lb/>(R1) <lb/>The transition state theory approach to determine the <lb/>bimolecular rate constant (k) of Reaction (R1) under <lb/>the pseudo-steady-state approximation considers two main <lb/></body>

        <body>terms, and it is expressed as <lb/>k bim = K eq k reac , <lb/>(1) <lb/>where K eq is the equilibrium constant of the formation of RC <lb/>and k reac is the unimolecular rate constant for the reaction of <lb/>RC to the product complex, given, respectively, by the fol-<lb/>lowing equations: <lb/>K eq = <lb/>1 <lb/>c 0 × exp -<lb/>G eq <lb/>RT <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>k reac = <lb/>k B T <lb/>h <lb/>× exp -<lb/>G # <lb/>RT <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where G eq is the Gibbs free energy of RC formation, c 0 <lb/>is the standard concentration of 1 M, h is Planck&apos;s constant, <lb/>k B is Boltzmann&apos;s constant, G # is the Gibbs free-energy <lb/>barrier separating RC from the products, R is the molar gas <lb/>constant, and T is the absolute temperature. <lb/>To account for low-barrier and barrierless processes in Re-<lb/>action (R1), namely the formation of the reactant complex, <lb/>the contribution of molecular diffusion is considered based <lb/>on the Collins-Kimball theory (Collins and Kimball, 1949), <lb/>and the overall rate constant for Reaction (R1) is then ex-<lb/>pressed as <lb/>k overall = <lb/>k bim × k D <lb/>k bim + k D <lb/>, <lb/>(4) <lb/>where k D is the steady-state Smoluchowski rate constant <lb/>given as (Smoluchowski, 1917): <lb/>k D = 4π R S(IV),PO DN A . <lb/>(5) <lb/>R S(IV),OP is the reaction distance between reactants S(IV) <lb/>and OP, defined as the sum of their radii, R S(IV) and R OP , <lb/>respectively. N A is the Avogadro number and D is the sum <lb/>of reactant diffusion coefficients D S(IV) and D OP (Truhlar, <lb/>1985). The diffusion coefficient for a reactant is related to its <lb/>radius in any medium of viscosity η by the Stokes-Einstein <lb/>approach (Einstein, 1905). For reactants S(IV) and OP in wa-<lb/>ter, the viscosity is that of water and the diffusion coefficients <lb/>are calculated as <lb/>D S(IV) = <lb/>k B T <lb/>6π ηR S(IV) <lb/>and D OP = <lb/>k B T <lb/>6π ηR OP <lb/>. <lb/>(6) <lb/>The radii were calculated with the Multiwfn software by as-<lb/>suming spherical reactants (Lu and Chen, 2012). It is known <lb/>that the viscosity of aerosols can be affected by relative hu-<lb/>midity, chemical composition, water uptake, and temperature <lb/>(Song et al., 2021). Given that aerosols are mixtures of dif-<lb/>ferent proportions of organic and inorganic salts, it is obvi-<lb/>ous that the actual diffusion coefficients and overall kinetics <lb/>of the studied reactions in aqueous aerosols will strongly de-<lb/>pend on the actual aerosol viscosity. <lb/>Figure 1. Gibbs free-energy profile of the stationary points in the <lb/>MHP + SO 2 q H 2 O reaction. Atoms&apos; color coding is yellow for sul-<lb/>fur, red for oxygen, gray for carbon, and white for hydrogen. <lb/>3 Results and discussion <lb/>The reactions with OPs were explored at three different pH <lb/>ranges, according to the prevalent states of dissolved SO 2 : <lb/>SO 2 q H 2 O at pH &lt; 1.81, HOSO -<lb/>2 at 1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97, and <lb/>SO 2-<lb/>3 at pH &gt; 6.97. Details on the distribution of dissolved <lb/>SO 2 are given in the Supplement, Table S1. From this distri-<lb/>bution, the following reactions were investigated: <lb/>pH &lt; 1.81 SO 2 q H 2 O + OP → products , <lb/>(R2) <lb/>1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97 HOSO -<lb/>2 + OP → products , <lb/>(R3) <lb/>pH &gt; 6.97 SO 2-<lb/>3 + OP → products . <lb/>(R4) <lb/>3.1 MHP reaction with dissolved SO 2 <lb/>At a pH below 1.81, the reaction of dissolved SO 2 with MHP <lb/>is driven by the interaction between SO 2 q H 2 O and MHP to <lb/>form SO 2 q H 2 O q MHP. The Gibbs free-energy surface of this <lb/>reaction, along with the structures of all stationary states, is <lb/>given in Fig. 1. The formation of SO 2 q H 2 O q MHP is rela-<lb/>tively endergonic at 298.15 K and a standard concentration <lb/>of 1 M. <lb/>This complex rearranges to methyl sulfate clustered to wa-<lb/>ter (CH 3 OSO 3 H q H 2 O), through the formation of an S-O <lb/>bond between the sulfur atom of SO 2 and one oxygen atom <lb/>of MHP. Although this product complex is formed with sub-<lb/>stantial Gibbs free-energy gain, ca. -54.73 kcal mol -1 be-<lb/>low the reactants, the process is separated by a high energy <lb/>barrier located at 45.72 kcal mol -1 above SO 2 q H 2 O q MHP. <lb/>This particularly high energy barrier is associated with <lb/>the difficulty of the SO 2 q H 2 O q MHP system to form two <lb/>new S-O bonds prior to CH 3 OSO 3 H q H 2 O formation. The <lb/>high energy barrier in this process is conducive to an ex-<lb/>tremely slow reaction, which occurs with a low overall rate <lb/></body>

        <body>constant of 1.81 × 10 -21 M -1 s -1 at 298.18 K. Hence, the <lb/>MHP + SO 2 q H 2 O reaction forming sulfate is likely without <lb/>significant relevance in natural waters. <lb/>At 1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97, where the bisulfite ion is the preva-<lb/>lent state of dissolved SO 2 , the prevailing interaction is be-<lb/>tween MHP and HOSO -<lb/>2 , and its mechanism is slightly dif-<lb/>ferent from that of the MHP + SO 2 q H 2 O reaction. From <lb/>the average local ionization energy-mapped (ALIE-mapped) <lb/>molecular van der Waals surfaces of MHP and HOSO -<lb/>2 <lb/>shown in Fig. 2, the most probable reaction sites are the oxy-<lb/>gen atoms of MHP and the sulfur atom of HOSO -<lb/>2 . In gen-<lb/>eral, based on the ALIE-mapped molecular van der Waals <lb/>surfaces, the OP + S(IV) reaction is mainly driven by the in-<lb/>teraction between the -O-O-function of OP and the sulfur <lb/>atom of S(IV), while other interactions are considered to be <lb/>without significance. Hence, the sulfur atom of HOSO -<lb/>2 can <lb/>interact both with the oxygen atom of MHP connected to its <lb/>carbon atom or that connected to its hydrogen atom, giving <lb/>rise to two different configurations (RC1 and RC2, shown in <lb/>Fig. 3) for MHP q HOSO -<lb/>2 . RC1 and RC2 react in different <lb/>ways to form different types of sulfates according to the fol-<lb/>lowing reactions: <lb/>RC1 → TS1 → CH 3 OSO -<lb/>3 + H 2 O , <lb/>(R5) <lb/>RC2 → TS2 → HSO -<lb/>4 + CH 3 OH . <lb/>(R6) <lb/>In the two TSs of Reactions (R5) and (R6), the S atom of <lb/>HOSO -<lb/>2 is being connected to MHP through its CH 3 O and <lb/>HO fragments, respectively, to form new S-O bonds. As <lb/>a result, Reaction (R5) forms organic sulfate (methyl sul-<lb/>fate, CH 3 OSO -<lb/>3 ), while Reaction (R6) forms inorganic sul-<lb/>fate (HSO -<lb/>4 ). The free-energy barrier in Reaction (R5) lies <lb/>36.02 kcal mol -1 above RC1, being ∼ 10 kcal mol -1 lower <lb/>than in the reaction at pH &lt; 1.81, which also forms methyl <lb/>sulfate. This is likely due to the electrostatic strain result-<lb/>ing from the electronic charge on HOSO -<lb/>2 , which induces a <lb/>certain pronounced stability of the TS. This strain is also re-<lb/>flected in the stability of CH 3 OSO -<lb/>3 <lb/>q H 2 O, which is formed <lb/>with -65.73 kcal mol -1 free-energy change. <lb/>Although RC1 and RC2 have almost the same for-<lb/>mation Gibbs free energies (see Fig. 3), the free-energy <lb/>barrier heights in their respective paths are 36.02 and <lb/>31.79 kcal mol -1 . This shows that at 1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97, the <lb/>process to form organosulfate is energetically less favored <lb/>than the process to form inorganic sulfate. Our finding is in <lb/>qualitative agreement with the results of Lind et al. (1987), <lb/>who found, while investigating the aqueous-phase oxidation <lb/>of S(IV) by MHP over the pH range 4.0-5.2, that 73 % of <lb/>inorganic sulfate was formed against 23 % of methyl sulfate. <lb/>The high proportion of sulfate relative to methyl sulfate ob-<lb/>served by Lind et al. (1987) can further be explained by the <lb/>demonstrated fast hydrolysis of methyl sulfate at acidic pH <lb/>(Hu et al., 2011) and its effective oxidation by OH radicals <lb/>(Kwong et al., 2018) to form inorganic sulfate. The implica-<lb/>tion for this is that MHP reaction with S(IV) will contribute <lb/>to aqueous aerosol mostly in terms of inorganic sulfate mass <lb/>loading. This further indicates that acidic waters may highly <lb/>favor inorganic sulfate from MHP relative to organosulfate. <lb/>Although the presence of additional water slightly alters the <lb/>barrier towards sulfate formation (see Fig. S1), the overall <lb/>effect of water is not significant due to poor water clustering <lb/>to MHP. Further details are given in Sect. S2. <lb/>As opposed to the bisulfite ion whose three oxygen atoms <lb/>can experience different interactions from the sulfur atom, at <lb/>pH &gt; 6.97 when the ion is fully deprotonated, the three oxy-<lb/>gen atoms of the sulfite ion (SO 2-<lb/>3 ) are identical and only one <lb/>type of product, namely organic sulfate is expected from its <lb/>reaction with MHP (see Fig. 3). The reactant complex in this <lb/>process is relatively more stabilized than RC1 and RC2, due <lb/>to an increased electrostatic strain as the result of the pres-<lb/>ence of an additional electronic charge. The TS in this re-<lb/>action lies 27.03 kcal mol -1 above the reactant complex, be-<lb/>ing nearly 9 kcal mol -1 lower than in the reaction that forms <lb/>methyl sulfate in the pH range 1.81-6.97. This indicates that <lb/>the organosulfate formation from the MHP + S(IV) reaction <lb/>is favored at high pH. <lb/>3.2 PAA reaction with dissolved SO 2 <lb/>Due to the difficulty for SO 2 q H 2 O to form two new S-O <lb/>bonds prior to organosulfate formation, the reaction with <lb/>PAA was investigated at 1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97 and pH &gt; 6.97 <lb/>exclusively. As expected from the ALIE-mapped molecu-<lb/>lar van der Waals surfaces of Fig. 2, the reactive sites in <lb/>PAA + S(IV) reactions are the oxygen atoms in the -O-O-<lb/>function of PAA and the sulfur atoms of the S(IV) entities. <lb/>Regardless of the pH range, our quantum chemical calcula-<lb/>tions predict the formation of both organic and inorganic sul-<lb/>fates. Specifically, the sulfur atom of dissolved SO 2 interacts <lb/>with both oxygen atoms of the -O-O-function in PAA, and <lb/>similar to the reaction with MHP, the sulfur atom attack on <lb/>-O-O-through the oxygen atom connected to carbon leads to <lb/>the formation of an organosulfate (acetyl sulfate), while the <lb/>attack through the oxygen atom connected to hydrogen gives <lb/>rise to inorganic sulfate. Energetics and optimized structures <lb/>of all relevant intermediates in PAA + S(IV) reactions are <lb/>given in Fig. 4. <lb/>In general, the reaction of PAA is much more favorable <lb/>to the formation of inorganic sulfate than the reaction of <lb/>MHP at all pH ranges, while the formation of organosulfate <lb/>is substantially prevented.

Based on the ALIE-mapped molecular van <lb/>der Waals surface (Fig. 2), the oxygen atoms of the -O-O-<lb/>function of BZP and the sulfur atom of HOSO -<lb/>2 are the <lb/>most likely reactive sites. The mechanisms of BZP reaction <lb/>with S(IV) are nearly identical at all pH above 1.81, start-<lb/>ing with the formation of a reactant complex that rearranges <lb/>through a transition state configuration to form benzoyl sul-<lb/>fate (organosulfate) and benzoic acid.

The current study confirms their exper-<lb/>imentally proposed mechanism for organosulfate formation, <lb/>with the further highlight that this mechanism might be more <lb/>dominant at a pH above 6.97. <lb/>3.4 Reactions with the sulfite radical ion (SO -<lb/>3 ) <lb/>The importance of the sulfite radical ion (SO -<lb/>3 ) to alter the <lb/>atmospheric sulfur chemistry and to promote sulfate forma-<lb/>tion has been revealed in recent studies (Hung and Hoff-<lb/>mann, 2015; Hung et al., 2018). SO -<lb/>3 is one of the main <lb/>chain carriers of the atmospheric autoxidation of SO 2 com-<lb/>monly existing in atmospheric aquatic systems. The reactiv-<lb/>ity of SO -<lb/>3 towards organic compounds to form organosul-<lb/>fur compounds has been investigated in a series of previous <lb/>studies (Huang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). SO -<lb/>3 can read-<lb/>ily form from the reduction of SO 2-<lb/>3 by NO 2 according to the <lb/>NO 2 (aq) + SO 2-<lb/>3 → NO -<lb/>2 + SO -<lb/>3 reaction catalyzed by both <lb/>light and metal ions (Sapkota et al., 2015). Considering that <lb/>SO -<lb/>3 and SO 2-<lb/>3 share similar structural properties and may <lb/>coexist in some aquatic environments, SO -<lb/>3 reactions with <lb/>MHP, PAA, and BZP were also investigated. While our at-<lb/>tempt to optimize PAA + SO -<lb/>3 could not succeed, we found <lb/>that SO -<lb/>3 could outperform SO 2-<lb/>3 in the MHP reaction, de-<lb/>creasing the free-energy barrier by 6.70 kcal mol -1 . How-<lb/>ever, the free-energy barrier was substantially increased (by <lb/>18.31 kcal mol -1 ) in the BZP reaction instead. These reac-<lb/>tivity differences between MHP and BZP towards SO -<lb/>3 can <lb/>be attributed to the repulsive effects of the electron density <lb/>in the benzyl rings of BZP and the spin density of the free <lb/>electron in SO -<lb/>3 , which seemingly destabilizes the transition <lb/>state in the reaction with BZP. <lb/>A close inspection of the configurations of different sta-<lb/>tionary states in SO -<lb/>3 reactions (Fig. 6) indicates that in the <lb/>transition state of BZP reaction, the spin density is located <lb/>opposite to the benzyl ring, which likely results in a strong re-<lb/>pulsion. This obviously destabilizes the transition state, giv-<lb/>ing rise to the high energy barrier as reported above. The <lb/>situation, however, is different in the transition state of the <lb/>MHP reaction where the spin density is more relaxed in the <lb/>configurational space of the main reactive entities. <lb/>4 Atmospheric implications <lb/>In a series of experiments, the Abbatt group suggested that <lb/>in peroxide reaction with S(IV), organosulfates are formed <lb/>directly from peroxide-SO 2 interactions instead of SO 2 be-<lb/>ing first oxidized by peroxides to SO 2-<lb/>4 followed by the re-<lb/>action between SO 2-<lb/>4 and organic species (Ye et al., 2018; <lb/>Wang et al., 2019, 2021). The current study is in line with <lb/>the observations of the Abbatt group and further explains <lb/>in detail their suggested mechanisms for sulfate formation. <lb/>Our calculations indicate that the importance of the degra-<lb/>dation pathway of OPs by reaction with S(IV) to form <lb/>(organo)sulfate in the aquatic environment is strongly depen-<lb/>dent on the pH and is especially important under acidic pH. <lb/>Besides reactions with dissolved SO 2 , other recent studies <lb/>showed that hydronium ions effectively catalyze the decom-<lb/>position of organic peroxides at acidic pH (Qiu et al., 2020; <lb/>Hu et al., 2020; Enami, 2021). It should be noted that <lb/>in these studies, the catalytic effect of the available pro-<lb/>ton was examined on specific classes of OPs, namely hy-<lb/>droperoxides with α-hydroxyalkyl, α-alkoxyalkyl, and α-<lb/>acyloxyalkyl substituents. The presence of the hydroperoxide <lb/>group (-OOH) and the α-substituent with the oxygen atom <lb/>(-O-) at the β-position in these peroxides enables the forma-<lb/>tion of a hydrogen-bonded ring structure involving the two <lb/>functions and further facilitate the decomposition.

(2019) raised the aerosol pH effect to be one of <lb/>the fundamental issues to model aqueous-phase sulfate for-<lb/>mation from the reactions of OPs with dissolved SO 2 . We <lb/>explored the conditions of pH 1-10, which are dominated by <lb/>different prevalent states of dissolved SO 2 .

The reaction rate at each pH is driven by specific frac-<lb/>tional populations of the different protonated states of S(IV): <lb/>δ(SO 2 q H 2 O) at pH &lt; 1.81, δ(HOSO -<lb/>2 ) at 1.81 &lt; pH &lt; 6.97, <lb/>and δ(SO 2-<lb/>3 ) at pH &gt; 6.97.

Atmospheric lifetimes <lb/>of OPs are calculated based on the effective rate constant of <lb/>Eq. (7), and considering that self-degradation is an unlikely <lb/>process given the simple structure of investigated OPs rela-<lb/>tive to those of, e.g., hydroperoxides with α-hydroxyalkyl, <lb/>α-alkoxyalkyl, and α-acyloxyalkyl substituents, whose self-<lb/>degradations are catalyzed by the proton (Enami, 2021), <lb/>these lifetimes are estimated based on S(IV) reactions ex-<lb/>clusively. <lb/>Figure 7 shows the effects of pH and temperature on the <lb/>effective rate constants while the numerical values are given <lb/>in Tables 1, S2, and S3. In general, the effective rate con-<lb/>stants of the reactions of OPs exhibit a positive temperature <lb/>dependency, with the steepest increase being observed at a <lb/>pH below 6.97, especially for the reaction of BZP. Above <lb/>this range, the effective rate constant becomes almost insen-<lb/>sitive to the pH. This indicates that the effect of pH change on <lb/>the formation of organosulfates from reactions of OPs with <lb/>dissolved S(IV) is most relevant in acidic aqueous environ-<lb/>ments. <lb/>In the pH range 1.81-6.97, the rate constant of the <lb/>MHP + HOSO -<lb/>2 reaction to form methyl sulfate (Reac-<lb/>tion R5) was estimated to be 2.38 × 10 -14 M -1 s -1 at <lb/>298.15 K, ∼ 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the re-<lb/>action to form inorganic sulfate (Reaction R6; overall rate <lb/>constant of 3.02×10 -11 M -1 s -1 ) and 7 orders of magnitude <lb/>higher than the overall rate constant of the MHP + SO 2 q H 2 O <lb/>reaction. The branching ratios estimated from the obtained <lb/>kinetics for the MHP + S(IV) reaction are 99.92 % and <lb/>0.08 % for inorganic sulfate and methyl sulfate, respectively. <lb/>This favored formation of inorganic sulfate relative to methyl <lb/>sulfate is in agreement with the experimental observation that <lb/>inorganic sulfate is the major product while methyl sulfate is <lb/>the second product in the MHP + HOSO -<lb/>2 reaction (Lind et <lb/>al., 1987). Regardless of the temperature, the effective rate <lb/>constant within this pH range increases by 3 orders of mag-<lb/>nitude as the pH increases. <lb/>The formation of methyl sulfate at a pH above 6.97 is <lb/>much more favorable than in the preceding investigated pH <lb/>range, occurring with an overall rate constant of 9.25 × <lb/>10 -8 M -1 s -1 at 298.15 K. However, the effective rate con-<lb/>stant in this range is almost insensitive to pH at all temper-<lb/>atures investigated (see Fig. 7). The estimated atmospheric <lb/>lifetimes for MHP at 298.15 K, based on this reaction, are <lb/>1.34 × 10 -5 -5.05 × 10 10 s in the pH range 1-10, and they <lb/>are shown to decrease with increasing pH. This indicates that <lb/>Figure 7.

Regardless of the pH <lb/>range, the branching ratios estimated from the kinetics are <lb/>100 % for inorganic sulfate formation and 0 % for organosul-<lb/>fate. This is in line with the experimental observation that <lb/>the reaction of PAA with dissolved SO 2 almost exclusively <lb/>forms inorganic sulfate (Lind et al., 1987). Lind et al. (1987) <lb/>measured a rate constant of (6.10 ± 2.60) × 10 2 M -1 s -1 for <lb/>this reaction at 291 K and pH 2.9-5.8. At the same temper-<lb/>ature and pH 5.8, we obtained an effective rate constant of <lb/>4.20 × 10 2 M -1 s -1 , in reasonable agreement with the ex-<lb/>perimental value. At pH 1-10 and 240-340 K, we obtained a <lb/>positive dependency for the effective rate constant (plot and <lb/>numerical values are shown in Fig. 7, Tables 1 and S3). From <lb/>these kinetics, the estimated atmospheric lifetimes for PAA <lb/>based on the reaction with dissolved SO 2 at 298.18 K and <lb/>pH 1-10 are within the range of 1.12 × 10 -16 -8.71 s. This <lb/>indicates that PAA is much more reactive than MHP towards <lb/>dissolved SO 2 under the investigated conditions. <lb/>BZP is more reactive than MHP and PAA towards S(IV) <lb/>at all pH above 1.81. Despite the mechanisms being nearly <lb/>similar in the investigated pH ranges, the overall rate con-<lb/>stants of the formation of benzoyl sulfate at 298.15 K are <lb/>1.55 × 10 -6 and 2.47 × 10 6 M -1 s -1 from BZP + HOSO -<lb/>2 <lb/>and BZP + SO 2-<lb/>3 , respectively. The full pH and temperature <lb/>dependencies of the total rate constant of the BZP + S(IV) <lb/>reaction are given in Table 1 and plotted in Fig. 7. It should <lb/>be noted that there is no direct formation of inorganic sulfate <lb/>in BZP reactions in the pH range investigated. Sufficient ev-<lb/>idence has been gathered about aromatic organosulfate for-<lb/>mation connected to anthropogenic activities, namely ben-<lb/>zyl sulfate and phenyl sulfate detected in ambient aerosols <lb/>from urban sites (Kuang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). <lb/>These aromatic and other organosulfates derived from poly-<lb/>cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are believed to form from aro-<lb/>matics interacting with sulfur-containing species (Blair et <lb/>al., 2017; Riva et al., 2015). It is likely that the investigated <lb/>BZP + S(IV) mechanism in this work would explain some of <lb/>such aromatic organosulfate formation mechanisms. <lb/>The calculated lifetimes for benzoyl peroxide in the in-<lb/>vestigated pH range and 298.15 K are in the range of 5.02 × <lb/>10 -19 -8.25 × 10 -3 s (see Table 1), decreasing with increas-<lb/>ing pH. These lifetimes are much lower than measured life-<lb/>times of ∼ 6 d in Los Angeles from the photolysis of OPs <lb/>(Krapf et al., 2016), indicating more efficient degradation in <lb/>the aqueous phase. The current results highlight the strong <lb/>pH impact on the degradation of BZP by S(IV). A previous <lb/>study also showed that aerosol pH can substantially alter the <lb/>formation of organosulfate from the reaction uptake of iso-<lb/>prene epoxydiols onto a mixture of ammonium sulfate and <lb/>sulfuric acid particles (Lei et al., 2022). <lb/>The overall rate constants of SO -<lb/>3 reactions with MHP <lb/>and BZP were determined to be 7.66 × 10 -3 and 9.13 × <lb/>10 -8 M -1 s -1 , respectively, regardless of the pH. Compared <lb/>to the rate constants of S(IV) reactions, the pathway for SO -<lb/>3 <lb/>may also significantly contribute to degrade MHP and BZP <lb/>and form organosulfate. Our results further show that sulfate <lb/>formation from PAA + S(IV) and BZP + S(IV) reactions is <lb/>more effective than from MHP + S(IV), and this pronounced <lb/>reactivity can be attributed to electron-withdrawing effects <lb/>of -C(O)R substituents (-C(O)-CH 3 and -C(O)-C 6 H 5 in PAA <lb/>and BZP, respectively) that activate the -O-O-function. This <lb/>finding further highlights that the specific nature of different <lb/>substituents to the -O-O-function may play a determinant <lb/>role in (organo)sulfate formation. It is obvious that OPs con-<lb/>taining the hydroperoxyl function will most likely contribute <lb/>to both organic and inorganic sulfate mass, whereas those <lb/>not containing this function will only form organosulfates. <lb/>Although OPs may not compete with, e.g., OH radicals in <lb/>S(IV) oxidation, their contribution to sulfate formation may <lb/>be important in low OH radical conditions.
