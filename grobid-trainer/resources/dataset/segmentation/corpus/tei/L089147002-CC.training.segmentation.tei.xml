			<body>The pyrochlore transition metal oxides, of general for-<lb/>mula A 2 B 2 O 7 , have been the topic of much interest in <lb/>recent years as they represent ideal systems for study-<lb/>ing the effects of geometrical frustration [1]. Both the A <lb/>and B sublattices form a network of corner-sharing tetra-<lb/>hedra such that it may not be possible to energetically <lb/>satisfy all the magnetic interactions simultaneously. The <lb/>resultant geometric frustration leads to the formation of <lb/>exotic ground states. Much of the recent work has con-<lb/>centrated on local moment systems where novel proper-<lb/>ties such as cooperative paramagnetism [2], partial, non-<lb/>collinear antiferromagnetic ordering [3, 4], spin-freezing <lb/>[5], and dipolar &quot;spin-ice&quot; behavior [6, 7] have been ob-<lb/>served. There has, however, been growing interest in the <lb/>interplay between itinerant and local moments in geo-<lb/>metrically frustrated systems. The metallic pyrochlore <lb/>Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect which <lb/>has been attributed to the Berry phase produced by spin <lb/>chirality on the pyrochlore lattice [8], while the spinel <lb/>compound, LiV 2 O 4 has been claimed to represent the <lb/>first known transition metal heavy-fermion system and <lb/>evidence exists that the unusual properties of this mate-<lb/>rial are related to geometrical frustration on the spinel <lb/>lattice. [9] <lb/>A vast body of work has been carried out on 3d and <lb/>4d transition metal pyrochlores. These are generally in-<lb/>sulators and possess either a spin-glass-like or long-range <lb/>ordered magnetic structure. In contrast, the 5d transition <lb/>metal pyrochlores are mainly metallic, resulting from the <lb/>extended nature of the 5d orbitals. The exception to this <lb/>is Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 [10] where the 5d 3 configuration of Os 5+ <lb/>results in a half-filled t 2g band and a metal-insulator <lb/>transition at 226 K. Despite the large number of transi-<lb/>tion metal compounds which crystallize in the pyrochlore <lb/>structure and the wide range of physical phenomena ob-<lb/>served in these materials, superconductivity had not been <lb/>observed until the recent discovery of bulk superconduc-<lb/>tivity in the 5d pyrochlore, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 [11, 12]. <lb/>Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure with <lb/>room temperature lattice constant a=10.219Å and an <lb/>oxygen positional parameter x=0.3089.[13] Recent inves-<lb/>tigations [11, 12, 14, 15, 16] have demonstrated the ex-<lb/>istence of two phase transitions in this compound. The <lb/>first, occurring at a temperature of about 200 K, is a <lb/>continuous structural transition which is accompanied <lb/>by drastic changes in resistivity and magnetic suscep-<lb/>tibility [15, 16]. On further lowering the temperature, <lb/>Cd Re 2 O 7 has been shown to exhibit bulk superconduc-<lb/>tivity below a sample dependent transition temperature <lb/>of about 1 K [11, 12, 14]. Preliminary measurements in <lb/>the superconducting state indicate that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a <lb/>type-II superconductor with H c1 less than 0.002 T and <lb/>estimates of the upper critical field, H c2 , ranging from <lb/>0.2 T to 1 T [11, 12, 14]. None of the measurements <lb/>reported to date extend below 0.3 K (T /T c ∼0.3) and <lb/>hence, little can be concluded about the symmetry of the <lb/>order parameter in this system. An exponential form of <lb/>the specific heat as T approaches zero was speculated by <lb/>Hanawa et al. [12] but they point out that measurements <lb/>to lower temperatures are clearly needed. We report the <lb/>first measurements on Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 below 300 mK, tem-<lb/>peratures which are necessary (for T c ∼ 1 K) to extract <lb/></body>

			<body>information about the superconducting order parameter <lb/>symmetry. We have performed transverse field (TF) and <lb/>zero field (ZF) muon spin rotation (µSR) measurements <lb/>on single crystal samples of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . The ZF-µSR <lb/>measurements reveal very small internal magnetic fields <lb/>which are characteristic of nuclear dipoles, indicating no <lb/>significant electronic magnetism either above or below <lb/>T c . The TF-µSR results provide the first measurement <lb/>of the internal field distribution in the vortex state in this <lb/>material. In particular, temperature dependent studies <lb/>from 20 mK to 4 K indicate a penetration depth which <lb/>levels off as T → 0, suggestive of a fully gapped Fermi <lb/>surface with a rather large zero temperature value of the <lb/>penetration depth, λ(0)∼7500Å. <lb/>Muon spin rotation has proven to be a very effective <lb/>probe in the study of superconductivity [17]. In partic-<lb/>ular, TF-µSR provides a measure of the length scales <lb/>associated with type-II superconductors, the penetration <lb/>depth, λ and the vortex core radius r 0 [17]. In a TF-µSR <lb/>experiment, spin polarized muons, with polarization per-<lb/>pendicular to the applied magnetic field direction, are <lb/>implanted in a sample at a location which is random on <lb/>the length scale of the vortex lattice. The muon precesses <lb/>at a rate proportional to the local magnetic field provid-<lb/>ing a measure of the local field distribution, n(B). The <lb/>presence of the vortex lattice results in a spatially inho-<lb/>mogeneous field distribution and a resulting muon spin <lb/>depolarization. <lb/>Early TF-µSR measurements assumed a Gaussian dis-<lb/>tribution of magnetic fields and with this approximation, <lb/>the penetration depth can be directly obtained from the <lb/>Gaussian depolarization rate, σ ∼ 1/λ 2 . This approx-<lb/>imation has been shown to be reasonable for the case <lb/>of polycrystalline samples but is inadequate for the case <lb/>of single crystals [17]. In this case, a Ginzburg-Landau <lb/>(GL) model has been developed to model the magnetic <lb/>field distribution for a single crystal. In GL theory, the <lb/>size of the vortex core is determined by the applied mag-<lb/>netic field, H, and the GL coherence length normal to the <lb/>applied field, ξ GL , while the penetration depth provides <lb/>the length scale of the decay of magnetic field away from <lb/>the vortex core. The field distribution is calculated from <lb/>the spatial distribution of magnetic field [18], <lb/>B(r) = <lb/>Φ 0 <lb/>S <lb/>(1 − b 4 ) <lb/>G <lb/>e −iG•r uK 1 (u) <lb/>1 + λ 2 G 2 , <lb/>(1) <lb/>where u 2 = 2ξ 2 <lb/>GL G 2 (1 + b 4 )[1 − 2b(1 − b 2 )], K 1 (u) is a <lb/>modified Bessel function, G is a reciprocal lattice vector <lb/>of the vortex lattice, b = H/H c2 is the reduced field, Φ 0 <lb/>is the flux quantum and S is the area of the reduced unit <lb/>cell for a hexagonal vortex lattice. <lb/>Single crystals of Cd Re 2 O 7 were grown using vapor-<lb/>transport techniques as described elsewhere [14, 19]. <lb/>Three samples with an approximate surface area of 5×5 <lb/>mm 2 each were mounted using low temperature grease <lb/>FIG. 1: Typical µSR spectra in Cd2Re2O7 obtained in a <lb/>transverse magnetic field of 0.007 T at temperatures of (a) <lb/>T=1.5 K (above Tc) and (b) T=100 mK (below Tc). <lb/>such that the cubic (100) direction would be parallel to <lb/>the applied magnetic field direction. They were mounted <lb/>on intrinsic GaAs in order to eliminate any precession sig-<lb/>nal at the background frequency [20] from muons which <lb/>miss the sample and would otherwise land in the Ag sam-<lb/>ple holder. The samples were covered with 0.025 mm Ag <lb/>foil which was bolted to the sample holder to ensure tem-<lb/>perature uniformity. The TF and ZF-µSR measurements <lb/>were performed in an Oxford Instruments dilution refrig-<lb/>erator on the M15 beamline at TRIUMF at temperatures <lb/>from 20 mK up to 4 K. <lb/>Given the estimated critical field values, we selected a <lb/>field value of 0.007 T and the temperature dependence <lb/>was measured by cooling the sample in the presence of <lb/>this applied magnetic field to ensure a uniform flux line <lb/>lattice. Figs. 1(a) and (b) show typical µSR spectra in <lb/>a transverse field of 0.007 T, for temperatures above and <lb/>below T c respectively. Examination of this data clearly <lb/>shows an enhanced depolarization rate on entering the <lb/>superconducting state resulting from the inhomogeneous <lb/>field distribution associated with the flux line lattice. <lb/>This represents the first experimental observation of the <lb/>vortex lattice in Cd Re 2 O 7 and provides clear evidence <lb/></body>

			<body>FIG. 2: Linewidth parameter σ as a function of temperature <lb/>in a transverse magnetic field of 0.007 T applied along the <lb/>(100) direction. The solid line is a fit to Eq. 2. <lb/>that this material is a type-II superconductor. The ob-<lb/>served increase in the TF line broadening below T c can <lb/>be attributed entirely to the vortex lattice since the ZF <lb/>muon spin relaxation rate (not shown here) was small <lb/>and roughly temperature independent below 2 K. <lb/>The solid lines shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b) represent <lb/>fits of the individual time spectra to a sample signal con-<lb/>sisting of a Gaussian envelope with fixed asymmetry and <lb/>a background signal with fixed linewidth and asymme-<lb/>try. The background, from muons which miss the sample <lb/>and land in the heat shields, was obtained independently <lb/>by performing measurements with the sample removed. <lb/>The resulting sample linewidth, σ, is shown in Fig. 2 <lb/>as a function of temperature. As one can clearly see, <lb/>the magnitude of the depolarization rate as T → 0 is <lb/>very small, saturating at a value of about 0.1 µs −1 . The <lb/>residual linewidth from nuclear dipoles, taken from the <lb/>data above T c , is very small in Cd Re 2 O 7 (about 0.03 <lb/>µs −1 ), allowing for clear observation of the line broaden-<lb/>ing associated with the flux line lattice. Apparently the <lb/>muons stop in sites which are not close to the Re ions, <lb/>which have appreciable nuclear moments. <lb/>As can be seen from Eq. 1, the field distribution de-<lb/>pends on both the penetration depth and GL coherence <lb/>depth. The GL coherence length can be obtained from <lb/>the known value of the upper critical field using the ex-<lb/>pression ξ GL = (Φ 0 /2πH c2 ) 1/2 where Φ 0 is the flux quan-<lb/>tum. As mentioned above, a range of values for H c2 <lb/>have been reported and consequently, to provide a self-<lb/>consistent measurement of λ, the field dependence of the <lb/>linewidth was measured. To account for any possible <lb/>instrumental field-dependence in the linewidth, measure-<lb/>ments were made above the transition temperature (2 <lb/>K) at each field value after which the sample was field-<lb/>cooled to 100 mK. The measured linewidth in the nor-<lb/>mal state was subtracted in quadrature from that ob-<lb/>FIG. 3: Linewidth parameter σF C as a function of magnetic <lb/>field applied along the (100) direction. The normal state con-<lb/>tribution has been subtracted as described in the text. Mea-<lb/>surements were taken at a temperature of 100 mK. <lb/>served at 100 mK and the results are plotted in Fig. 3 <lb/>as a function of applied magnetic field. As can be clearly <lb/>seen, the linewidth decreases almost linearly with applied <lb/>field. This is attributed to the linear increase in the vol-<lb/>ume taken up by the vortices. The linewidth parameter, <lb/>σ F C , approaches zero at a field of 0.5 T which is our <lb/>estimate of H c2 (T→0) and is consistent with measure-<lb/>ments on other samples. This estimate of the critical <lb/>field corresponds to ξ GL ∼ 260Å. Using this value, we <lb/>obtain the penetration depth using the field distribution <lb/>shown in Eq. 1. The resulting temperature dependent <lb/>penetration depth is shown in Fig. 4. As expected from <lb/>the small values of linewidth, at the base temperature <lb/>we observe a rather large value of the penetration depth, <lb/>λ(0) ∼ 7500Å. We note that this value of penetration <lb/>depth is significantly larger than most oxide supercon-<lb/>ductors where values ranging from 1000-2000Å are typ-<lb/>ical [21, 22]. <lb/>As the penetration depth is related to the concentra-<lb/>tion of superconducting carriers, its temperature depen-<lb/>dence is a measure of the low-lying electronic excitations. <lb/>As such, the presence of a nodeless superconducting en-<lb/>ergy gap is indicated by a leveling off of the penetra-<lb/>tion depth as the temperature decreases below T c . As is <lb/>clearly seen in Figs. 2 and 4, the linewidth and penetra-<lb/>tion depth respectively become temperature independent <lb/>as the temperature decreases below about 0.4 K, consis-<lb/>tent with a fully gapped Fermi surface. Consequently, <lb/>we conclude that the superconducting order parameter in <lb/>Cd Re 2 O 7 is consistent with a nodeless energy gap sug-<lb/>gesting either s-wave symmetry or exotic pairing symme-<lb/>tries, such as p-wave which can also exhibit a fully gapped <lb/>Fermi surface.

There is considerable uncertainty in <lb/>estimations of the mean-free path with reported values <lb/>ranging from 200-700Å[14, 23] and it is unclear whether <lb/>Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a superconductor in the clean or dirty limit. <lb/>If the material is in the clean limit, the present results <lb/>provide strong evidence for a fully gapped Fermi surface. <lb/>Under the assumption of a clean superconductor, such <lb/>that ξ 0 /l ≪ 1, a value of n s m e /m * of 5.0×10 25 m −3 <lb/>can be obtained using Eq. 4 and the measured penetra-<lb/>tion depth. On the other hand, if l ∼200Å (i.e. the dirty <lb/>limit) then we obtain ξ 0 ∼470Å and n s m e /m * ∼1.4×10 26 <lb/>m −3 . Clearly, precise determination of the mean free <lb/>path for Cd Re 2 O 7 is needed to allow accurate quantita-<lb/>tive information to be extracted. <lb/>In conclusion, we have performed µSR studies of the <lb/>superconducting state in the recently discovered py-<lb/>rochlore superconductor, Cd Re 2 O 7 . Zero-field measure-<lb/>ments indicate no significant magnetism in this super-<lb/>conductor, suggesting that magnetic frustration does not <lb/>play a direct role in the superconductivity. Transverse-<lb/>field measurements show that Cd Re 2 O 7 is a type-II su-<lb/>perconductor and indicate a superconducting order pa-<lb/>rameter consistent with a fully gapped Fermi surface <lb/>with a zero temperature value of penetration depth of <lb/>∼7500Å. However, considering that the superconductor <lb/>may be in the dirty limit, spectroscopic techniques which <lb/>directly measure the density of states would be required <lb/>to confirm this conclusion. <lb/></body>
