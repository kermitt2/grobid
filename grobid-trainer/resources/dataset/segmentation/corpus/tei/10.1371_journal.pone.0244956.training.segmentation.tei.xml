In this research, we report a sample preparation method using a <lb/>novel handheld electroflotation system to concentrate and recover dilute quantities <lb/>(10 2 −10 3 CFU/mL) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) 25922 in artificially contaminated samples for <lb/>reliable, rapid detection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). To protect sus-<lb/>pended cells from shear stresses at bubble surfaces, a non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic-F68) <lb/>and flocculant (chitosan oligosaccharide) were used to aggregate cells and reduce their sur-<lb/>face hydrophobicity. Effective conditions for recovery were determined through multifacto-<lb/>rial experiments including various concentrations of Pluronic-F68 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 g L -1 ), <lb/>chitosan oligosaccharide (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 g L -1 ), bacteria (10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 CFU/mL E. coli <lb/>25922), recovery times (10, 15 and 20 minutes), and degrees of turbulent gas flux (&quot;high&quot; <lb/>and &quot;low&quot;). The automated electroflotation system was capable of concentrating effectively <lb/>all of the bacteria from a large sample (380 mL 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer containing <lb/>10 2 CFU/mL E. coli) into a 1 mL recovered fraction in less than 30 minutes. This enabled <lb/>detection of bacterial contaminants within 2 hours of collecting the sample, without a special-<lb/>ized laboratory facility or traditional enrichment methods, with at least a 2-3 order of magni-<lb/>tude improvement in detection limit compared to direct assay with LAMP. <lb/></front>

			<body>to ensure food safety the HACCP regulations set forth in 9 CFR Part 417 lifted the uniformed <lb/>federal control regulations across meat and poultry establishments. The conversion from a <lb/>one-size-fits-all to the current contemporary conditions that allow establishments to make <lb/>site-specific production decisions shifted the responsibility of ensuring food safety from the <lb/>federal inspectors to the industry establishment. This flexible approach permitted establish-<lb/>ments to integrate or innovate novel technologies that enable on-site point-of-care (POC) <lb/>sampling and detection of pathogenic organisms from food and in the environment to control <lb/>and mitigate the spread of contamination in their unique production processes. <lb/>While rapid, portable diagnostic platforms have reached commercial maturity, trace quan-<lb/>tities (�10 3 CFU) of bacterial contaminants dispersed in ecological scaled sample sizes (hun-<lb/>dreds of grams or liters) remain notoriously difficult to detect. Nucleic acid based detection <lb/>technologies like loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [4] have significantly short-<lb/>ened the time to detection (30-60 minutes) and are supported in commercial handheld plat-<lb/>forms, but typically have a limits of detection (LOD) of 10 3 −10 4 CFU/mL at best. The <lb/>implementation of LAMP supporting technologies into routine POC sampling procedures is <lb/>limited by sample preparation requirements (i.e. culture enrichment) that produce sufficient <lb/>target quantities for amplification [5]. Culture enrichment methods can extend the time <lb/>required to achieve preliminary screening results from 6-8 hours [6] to 3-7 days [7, 8]. Meth-<lb/>ods like centrifugation, immunomagnetic separation (IMS), and filtration are commonly used <lb/>to separate or concentrate bacteria cells from sample matrix prior to detection however these <lb/>technologies are not easily adaptable for point-of-care testing. IMS techniques integrated with <lb/>3D-printed microfluidic devices have successfully isolated and separated captured bacteria <lb/>from unbound magnetic particles for detection of pathogens down to 100 cfu/mL in milk, <lb/>however IMS itself requires expensive functionalized magnetic particles and external syringe <lb/>pumps to manipulate the sample [9]. Low cost, simple POC technologies facilitating sample <lb/>size reduction by concentrating cells into small er volumes while simultaneously recovering all <lb/>of the initial targeted bacteria prior to the application of nucleic acid amplification could <lb/>improve sampling techniques required for environmental testing or sites of sporadic <lb/>contamination. <lb/>Production of biodiesel and other natural products from algae requires similar processes <lb/>such as filtration, coagulation, flocculation, flotation, sedimentation or centrifugation to <lb/>recover biomass from suspension [10]. Significant research has been conducted into flotation <lb/>processes for industrial dewatering of algae including by froth flotation [11], dispersed air flo-<lb/>tation [12] and, less commonly, electro-flotation [13]. While research on methods to recover <lb/>viable bacterial cells using flotation is sparse, techniques used in wastewater treatment or <lb/>industrial algal harvesting involving stabilization and separation of dispersed systems may be <lb/>applied to separate and concentrate bacteria from dilute suspensions. <lb/>Aeration of bioreactors is commonly used to control dissolved gas concentrations in cell <lb/>culture for production of biological products like therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and antibod-<lb/>ies, especially in large industrial systems (&gt; 10,000 L) with high cell densities (&gt;10 6 CFU/ml) <lb/>that are highly diffusion limited [14]. Typical aeration processes such as gas sparging, however, <lb/>can result in significant stress to cells [15], requiring additives to reduce foaming and the <lb/>shearing stresses due to hydrophobic interactions with cell surfaces [14]. Cell death may also <lb/>occur in bacteria confined in bubble films when the bubbles rupture [16], or even if the degree <lb/>of turbulence of circulating media is especially intense resulting in high shear in the liquid <lb/>phase itself [15, 17]. <lb/>Turbulent shear stress on cells in a culture can be stabilized by adding surfactants to the <lb/>media [18]. Surfactants can change interactions between a bubble and surrounding biological <lb/>material in a fluid by modifying the surface tension forces that typically attract, stress or <lb/></body>

			<body>disperse biomaterial [14, 16, 19]. Pluronic1 F-68 is a commercially available non-ionic surfac-<lb/>tant that has been widely investigated and shown to protect cells by masking hydrophobic sur-<lb/>faces and thereby reducing shearing effects on the cell membrane from interaction with <lb/>hydrophobic gas bubbles [20]. <lb/>Flotation by microbubbles relies on the attachment of a particle to the bubble to form bub-<lb/>ble-floc aggregates that rise to the surface of the media. As demonstrated in sewage purification <lb/>or ore refineries, aggregating particles prior to flotation can result in a substantial increase in <lb/>particle mass recovered [21]. Considering numerous applications of flotation of biological <lb/>materials, flotation was optimized to achieve 99% recovery rates of Chlorella sp. [22], bacterial <lb/>suspensions including Escherichia coli (E. coli) [23, 24], and microalgae [12] by adding cationic <lb/>polyelectrolytes (i.e. chitosan) as flocculants to aggregate bacterial suspensions. <lb/>Chitosan, characterized as a linear polysaccharide that has various proportions of (1!4) <lb/>linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranose (GlcNAc) and 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glu-<lb/>copyranose [25], is an inexpensive, biodegradable, non-toxic, cationic natural polymer/ poly-<lb/>saccharide obtained by partial (~50%) deacetylation of chitin found in the exoskeleton of <lb/>crustaceans like shrimp [26]. The cationic nature of chitosan is particularly desirable to floccu-<lb/>late and aggregate negatively charged particles. Bacterial cells contain large quantities of side <lb/>chain amino acids, methyl groups attached to polysaccharides and long chain carbon groups <lb/>found in lipids; all contributing to the hydrophobicity and predominantly negative surface <lb/>charge of cell membranes [27]. In gram negative bacterial cells, the anionic phosphate and car-<lb/>boxyl group residing on lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the outer membrane (OM) can electro-<lb/>statically interact with the cationic molecules such as the regularly repeating protonated amine <lb/>groups of chitosan [28]. When used as a flocculant chitosan polyelectrolytes rely on electro-<lb/>static interactions to mask the negative charge of cells that would normally disperse stably in a <lb/>suspension, thereby promoting their aggregation and separation [24]. <lb/>In this report, we investigate the effects of adding chemical stabilizers (pluronic and chito-<lb/>san) to enhance concentration, recovery and detection by LAMP of small quantities of dis-<lb/>persed bacterial contaminants by electroflotation (EF) performed in a hand-held automated <lb/>system [29]. Additionally, a simple sample preparation procedure was developed so that recov-<lb/>ered EF samples could be directly added to a LAMP assay without DNA purification or inhibi-<lb/>tion on LAMP reaction. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Preparation of bacterial cultures, purified DNA and media <lb/>E. coli ATCC strain 25922 bacteria were stored at -80˚C prior to experimentation. After <lb/>removal from storage E. coli 25922 was propagated twice overnight on plate-count agar <lb/>(Difco TM ) at 37˚C. Colonies were then transferred into sterilized potassium phosphate buffer <lb/>(0.1 M, pH 6.6) adjusted to achieve an absorbance of 0.13 at 600 nm as read on a commercially <lb/>available spectrophotometer (Healthcare Ultraspec TM 10, General Electric, Boston, MA). This <lb/>absorbance was shown empirically to be equivalent to about 10 8 CFU/ml (x = 1.63 x 10 8 CFU/ <lb/>mL, s = 2.55x10 7 CFU/mL, n = 3) through comparison to standard plate counting methods. <lb/>Bacterial cultures and media were freshly prepared for each electro-flotation experiment.

All LAMP reactions were performed in <lb/>25 μL (total volume) containing 40 pmol of each inner primer (BIP and FIP), 5 pmol of each <lb/>outer primer (B3 and F3), 20 pmol of each loop primer (LB and LF). Reactions were prepared <lb/>by adding 5 μL of a stock primer solution and 5 μL of sample to 15 μL of commercially avail-<lb/>able Isothermal Mastermix with dye (Catalog No. ISO-001, Optigene, Inc., Horsham, UK). All <lb/>primers were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). <lb/>All reactions were performed in 0.1 mL TempPlate semi-skirt PCR 96-well Plates (Catalog No. <lb/>1402-9100, USA Scientific, Inc., Ocala, FL, USA) in a commercial real-time PCR machine <lb/>(StepOnePlus TM Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA, USA) incubated at 65˚C for 31 minutes. <lb/>Fluorescence values were recorded every 30 seconds during the 31-minute reactions. The <lb/>&quot;threshold time&quot; t T was estimated as the amount of time required for the fluorescence value to <lb/>exceed a threshold value equivalent to the pooled average plus three standard deviations of the <lb/>fluorescence values observed throughout reactions of triplicate negative control reactions [30]. <lb/>Reported averages of t T values exclude assays with undefined t T values (t T &gt;31 minutes). Reac-<lb/>tions were conducted in triplicate for each template DNA concentration and primer set, <lb/>including for the non-template controls. <lb/>Effect of Pluronic and chitosan on LAMP <lb/>The addition of chemical additives to any LAMP reaction can affect the assay performance <lb/>therefore the inhibitory effects of pluronic (Pluronic 1 F-68, non-ionic surfactant, Thermo <lb/>Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and chitosan (chitosan oligosaccharide RCHOF, <lb/>molecular weight = 340-1,600 Da, Food Grade, Qingdao BZ Oligo Biotech Co., Ltd, Qingdoa, <lb/>China) on LAMP were evaluated. Varying concentrations of pluronic (0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, <lb/>1.0%) and chitosan (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 g L -1 ) prepared in sterilized DI water and 0.1 M phos-<lb/>phate buffer (pH 5.8) respectively were added to individual LAMP assays. 25 μL reactions were <lb/>prepared by adding 5 μL of a stock primer solution (Ecol 3109_1) and 5 μL of sample contain-<lb/>ing 4 μL of tested concentrations of pluronic or chitosan and 1 μL containing 0.2 ng of purified <lb/>E. coli 25922 DNA to 15 μL of commercially available Isothermal Mastermix with dye (Catalog <lb/>No. ISO-001, Optigene, Inc., Horsham, UK).

			<body>hydroxide was added to chitosan containing samples. Simulated EF samples (0.1 M potassium <lb/>phosphate buffer pH 5.8) were prepared containing 0.1 g L -1 pluronic and varying concentra-<lb/>tions of chitosan (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 g L -1 ). The final volume of each sample was 1 mL. 4 μL of a <lb/>stock (10 ng/μL) purified E. coli 25922 DNA was added to each 1mL aliquots containing chito-<lb/>san + pluronic + phosphate buffer and mixtures allowed to sit for 10 minutes. The final con-<lb/>centration of E. coli DNA in each 1 mL sample was 0.04 ng/μL. Next, the pH of was adjusted <lb/>from pH 5.8 to approximately pH 11 by adding 99 μL of 1 M NaOH to each 1 mL simulated <lb/>EF sample and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Subsequently pH <lb/>adjusted samples were vortexed at medium speed for 10 seconds, then centrifuged at 1300 rcf <lb/>for 3 minutes (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415D, Hamburg, Germany). Individual 25 μL LAMP <lb/>assays were prepared by pipetting 5 μL of the supernatant from each sample as described <lb/>above to 15 μL Isothermal Mastermix and 5 μL of a stock primer solution (Ecol 3109_1) in a <lb/>0.1 mL LAMP reaction tube. Each LAMP reaction contained a final E. coli DNA amount of 0.2 <lb/>ng. For each tested chitosan concentration (4 concentrations total) a corresponding duplicate <lb/>control sample was made except without the addition of sodium hydroxide. The pH was mea-<lb/>sured at each step of the above procedure prior to running a LAMP reaction using an AB15 <lb/>Plus meter (Accumet Basic, Fisher Scientific). Three experimental LAMP assay replicates were <lb/>performed for each sample composition to determine the effects on LAMP threshold times <lb/>(t T ). Negative and positive controls were prepared using the same method as previously <lb/>described except negative controls did not contain any template DNA. Both positive and nega-<lb/>tive controls contained pluronic but not chitosan in phosphate buffer pH 5.8 adjusted to pH <lb/>11 with 1 M NaOH. <lb/>Preparation of spiked electroflotation samples <lb/>380 mL of sterile phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.8) was inoculated with appropriate volumes of <lb/>freshly prepared E. coli 25922 culture in 500 mL sterilized flasks to achieve 10 2 −10 4 CFU/mL <lb/>bacterial suspension concentrations. To homogenously disperse bacteria into suspension, sam-<lb/>ples were mechanically shaken briefly (90 seconds) after inoculation and used promptly for <lb/>subsequent electro-flotation experiments. <lb/>Electroflotation system control <lb/>Flotation of E. coli 25922 was carried out in a custom engineered handheld electroflotation <lb/>(EF) cell with an approximate 400 mL capacity [29]. Electrolysis reactions were supported on <lb/>inert platinum plated titanium electrode arrays. A graphical interface allows the user to define <lb/>process parameters including durations (min.), voltage (3.5-12 V) or current (0-1000 mA), <lb/>frequency (0-100 Hz), and duty cycle (1-100%) applied to the electrode arrays. The entire pro-<lb/>cess consists of two steps, 1) concentration and 2) recovery, allowing complete automation of <lb/>the sample preparation process. During the concentration step, collimated microbubbles from <lb/>an inner electrode array direct particulates into an inverted conical collection area in the lid of <lb/>the cartridge. To eject concentrated particulates in the recovery step, a concentric electrode <lb/>array is energized to force gas into a trap, displacing sample from a port at the top of the collec-<lb/>tion area. <lb/>Preliminary electroflotation of E. coli 25922 <lb/>Prepared media samples at 27˚C were gently poured into the electro-flotation chamber and <lb/>sealed with the lid. Previous studies on electroflotation have demonstrated that the volumetric <lb/>rate of bubbles passing through a cross sectional area at any given time (flux rate) increase <lb/>with higher levels of current density applied across the electrode surfaces [32-34]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Furthermore, high frequencies and large duty cycle ratios can increase fluid circulation, turbu-<lb/>lent mixing and stirring [35]. To investigate the effect of excessive mixing during flotation due <lb/>to the &quot;stirring effect&quot; samples were subjected to &quot;high&quot; turbulence (HT) (500mA/ 100 Hz/ <lb/>75% duty cycle for concentration, 650 mA/ 100 Hz/ 75% duty cycle for recovery) or &quot;low&quot; tur-<lb/>bulence (LT) (300mA/ 20 Hz/ 30% for concentration and 600mA/20 Hz/ 50% duty cycle for <lb/>recovery), for durations of 10, 15 or 20 minutes, and for each bacterial concentration (10 2 , 10 3 , <lb/>or 10 4 CFU/mL). Three replicates were performed for each experimental treatment without <lb/>additional chemical additives. <lb/>EF treatments with pluronic F-68 <lb/>To enhance viable cell recovery, 0.0038, 0.038, 0.380 and 3.8 mL of pluronic (10%) was added <lb/>to 380 mL of inoculated EF samples containing 10 2 and 10 3 CFU/mL of E. coli 29522 to achieve <lb/>pluronic concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 g L -1 respectively and subjected to 15 min HT EF <lb/>and 20 min LT EF. Three experimental replicates were performed for each varying pluronic <lb/>concentration condition. <lb/>EF treatment with chitosan and pluronic <lb/>To aggregate cells into shear protected flocs, agricultural grade chitosan oligosaccharide (solu-<lb/>ble in pH 5-7) was added to spiked EF samples containing 10 2 CFU/mL of E. coli 29522 to <lb/>achieve final concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 g L -1 . Appropriate chitosan concentrations <lb/>were prepared by serially diluting a stock concentration of 10 g L -1 chitosan. Pluronic was <lb/>added in the same way as previously described. Next, the cultures were placed on a shaker for <lb/>30 minutes at 50 rpm and then gently transferred to the EF cartridge and subjected to 20 min <lb/>LT of EF treatment. Three experimental replicates were performed for each varying chitosan <lb/>concentration condition. <lb/>Recovery of electroflotation treated samples and DNA template extraction <lb/>The first 3 mL displaced from every EF treatment condition were collected into individual 1 mL <lb/>fractions in Eppendorf tubes. DNA from all recovered fractions was extracted by boiling (crude <lb/>cell lysate method; 100˚C for 10 min [36]) followed by 15 seconds of low speed vortexing. For <lb/>detection of E. coli 25922 in recovered fractions from EF treated samples, 5 μL of crude lysed <lb/>sample was directly used in an individual LAMP assay. For every 1 mL fraction recovered, 3 <lb/>LAMP assays were performed. Samples containing chitosan were processed in the same way <lb/>except the pH of 5.8 was adjusted to approximately pH 11 with sodium hydroxide solution fol-<lb/>lowing crude cell lysis. This method is described in further detail in the above section &quot;Inhibitor <lb/>removal&quot;. Three experimental replicates were performed for each treatment condition. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>To evaluate the inhibition effects of pluronic and chitosan on a LAMP assay, differences in <lb/>threshold times were evaluated by linear regression or one-way ANOVA.

In this state, it will bind <lb/>through electrostatic interaction to negatively charged particles (i.e. E. coli and anionic DNA) <lb/>interfering with LAMP primer annealing and therefore inhibiting amplification. Samples con-<lb/>taining 1 g L -1 chitosan significantly (p = 0.025) inhibited LAMP amplification increasing the <lb/>time to detection by 6 minutes (t T = 15, σ = 9.24) compared to the control samples (t T = 9, σ = <lb/>0) (Fig 3A) and resulting in marked decrease in reaction consistency. While samples contain-<lb/>ing 0.01 g L -1 (p = 0.998) and 0.1 g L -1 (p = 0.897) chitosan were not shown to have statistically <lb/>significant changes in t T relative to controls, this was largely due to reduced reaction consis-<lb/>tency under these conditions, and average threshold times in fact increased from 9 min for the <lb/>control to 9.6 and 11.33 min for the two respective treatments (Fig 3A). Treatment with <lb/>sodium hydroxide decreased the inhibition on LAMP amplification in samples containing <lb/>lower concentrations of chitosan (0.01-0.1 g L -1 ) and also in samples containing high concen-<lb/>trations of chitosan (1 g L -1 ) so that amplification was normalized compared to control sam-<lb/>ples at the equivalent template DNA concentration (Fig 3B). LAMP amplification was <lb/>inhibited completely in samples containing chitosan in concentrations greater than 1 g L -1 and <lb/>sodium hydroxide was ineffective to improve amplification (Fig 3B). Electroflotation treat-<lb/>ments will non-specifically concentrate any particle ranging in size from 0.5 microns to 200 <lb/>microns, including chitosan aggregates.

This value is well above the pKa <lb/>(~pH 9.5) of the amine groups on chitosan. The chitosan used in this study is water soluble <lb/>(~pH 7-8) and precipitated out of solution at pH 11. The precipitated chitosan was collected at <lb/>the bottom of the tube by brief centrifugation and the pH adjusted EF sample was pipetted from <lb/>the top of the supernatant and added directly to the LAMP assay reaction mix. Once the sample <lb/>is added to the LAMP reaction tube, the buffering capacity of the isothermal mastermix, likely <lb/>containing Tris-HCl or equivalent, adjusted the reaction mix with EF sample pH to 9. At pH 9 <lb/>chitosan is in a cationic DNA binding state (i.e. below the pKa). However, at this point in the <lb/>sample preparation procedure most of the chitosan was removed, or present in trace quantities, <lb/>from the sample so that inhibition on LAMP amplification was adequately reduced. <lb/>EF treatment with pluronic <lb/>To protect cells from lysis by hydrodynamic shear forces during EF treatments, varying con-<lb/>centrations of pluronic (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 g L -1 ) were added to EF samples. In preliminary <lb/>experiments 0.001 g L -1 pluronic concentration was presumed too low to affect EF treatments <lb/>and did not significantly change the detection rates by LAMP. On the other hand, addition of <lb/>1 g L -1 pluronic to EF treatments resulted in undesirable amounts of foam formation during <lb/>electrolysis, leading to premature sample displacement and potential aerosolization of the <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>were assayed by LAMP in triplicate. Differences in recovered quantities of E. coli were then <lb/>inferred from increased detection rates and/or diminished threshold times. In half of the con-<lb/>ditions tested (0.01 g L -1 pluronic and 10 3 CFU/mL, and; 0.1 g L -1 pluronic and 10 3 CFU/mL) <lb/>detectable DNA was more likely to be concentrated into the 1 st mL fraction, though distribu-<lb/>tions in other conditions were more random (Fig 5A). These results are generally consistent <lb/>with the mechanism of cell protection with pluronic, whereby cells are more likely to remain <lb/>intact and in stable suspension, so that the partitioning effect of momentum transfer from bub-<lb/>bles results in a gradient of higher concentration in the conical collection chamber, but not <lb/>complete aggregation of cellular material at the surface. <lb/>In contrast samples containing 0.1 g L -1 (Fig 5B) pluronic yielded more positive LAMP <lb/>assays in the 2 nd mL than the 1 st mL. For samples containing 10 2 CFU/mL E. coli there was an <lb/>even more variable distribution pattern of quantifiable DNA as many of the recovered samples <lb/>were below the detection limit of the LAMP assay. The fractions collected for samples contain-<lb/>ing 10 3 CFU/mL did contain higher concentrations of DNA (by one order of magnitude) <lb/>when compared to corresponding controls however the results were inconsistent and there <lb/>was as much recovered in the third fraction as the first. While there is a definite density gradi-<lb/>ent established by the flotation process, turbulent mixing of the effluent likely prevents all the <lb/>particulates from concentrating at the very top of the electroflotation chamber column. <lb/>EF treatment with chitosan and pluronic <lb/>Following 20-minutes of low turbulence EF treatment of media with 10 2 CFU/mL E. coli <lb/>25922 and 0.1 g L -1 pluronic, LAMP assays positively detected the bacteria with mean detec-<lb/>tion rates of 100% and 96.3% respectively in samples with 0.1 or 0.01 g L -1 chitosan. Statisti-<lb/>cally significant differences (p = 0.0001) in detection rates were observed for all treatments <lb/>containing chitosan (0.1 or 0.01 g L -1 ) when compared to the corresponding control sample <lb/>with pluronic but no chitosan and detection rate of 10% (Fig 6). These results were confirmed <lb/>using Dunnett&apos;s multiple comparison a posteriori test. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The degree to which the EF system was capable of concentrating bacteria dispersed in media <lb/>was measured indirectly by observing changes in detection rate of LAMP assay.

			<body>rates of ~50% and 100% respectively [29]. Optimizing surfactant (Pluronic1 F-68) and floccu-<lb/>lant (chitosan) concentrations eventually allowed us to detect bacterial quantities of 10 2 CFU/ <lb/>mL at average rates of 96.3%-100%. By interpolating these detection rates into the LAMP LOD <lb/>standard curve suggest that the recovered 1 mL fraction is functionally equivalent to samples <lb/>containing 10 4 −10 5 CFU/mL and that all or nearly all of the bacteria from the original 380 ml <lb/>media sample containing 10 2 CFU/mL was recovered. <lb/>In one subsequent experimentation trial conducted after this study the user was unable to <lb/>detect E. coli in any of the collected fractions from a sample originally containing 10 2 CFU/ <lb/>mL, chitosan and pluronic. While there are numerous reasons for these results including the <lb/>use of different lot batches of LAMP reagents, different bacterial stocks, etc., the inconsisten-<lb/>cies in recovery rates are more likely attributed to a few compounded factors. Firstly, the cur-<lb/>rent prototype of the electroflotation device is custom made using machined or hand cut parts <lb/>and is cumbersome to assemble and load the sample. Any slight deveation from the standard <lb/>optimized protocol when loading the sample can affect where the sample is contained in the <lb/>flotation chamber, the time it takes the sample to process (i.e. eject from the cartridge), the <lb/>concentration efficiency and therefore downstream detection of the recovered material. It is <lb/>possible that some of the flocculated bacterial aggregates concentrate in the gas trap instead of <lb/>the conical collection area preventing those trapped bacteria from being recovered. Secondly, <lb/>turbulent mixing of the effluent prevents all of the particulates from concentrating at the very <lb/>top of the column. Depending on the quantity of bacteria trapped and unable to concentrate <lb/>in the intended chamber, this would significantly lower the rate of detection, especially con-<lb/>cerning for lower quantities of bacterial concentrations (i.e. 10 2 CFU/mL). In the future design <lb/>modifications to the electroflotation system that simplify assembly (i.e. screw on cap and <lb/>Fig 6.

			<body>embedded electrode array) and sample loading (i.e. disposable cartridge) would greatly <lb/>improve the user experience and reliability of sample processing. Additionally, a solid support <lb/>structure that captures bacteria could more efficiently recover and concentrate the microbes in <lb/>the strata containing bacteria formed during flotation. <lb/>The addition of a non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic 1 F-68) alone to EF treatments improved <lb/>concentration of E. coli 25922 and therefore improved detection rates of E. coli 25922 by <lb/>LAMP. The mechanism by which pluronic improves concentration of dispersed bacteria dur-<lb/>ing flotation was not investigated. Interestingly, one study reports the use of surfactants to <lb/>improve electro-kinetic stability of electrodes in lab-on-chip micro device by promoting <lb/>smaller bubble diameters and also more rapid bubble detachment from the electrode surface <lb/>[37]. While this effect was not measured directly, casual observation confirmed that fewer <lb/>large bubbles formed and detached from electrodes in the presence of Pluronic. This suggests <lb/>that the effect of pluronic to improve concentration of bacteria by EF extends beyond bubble-<lb/>particle interactions by enabling quicker bubble detachment likely resulting in overall smaller <lb/>and more uniformly sized microbubbles with smaller terminal velocities and collectively <lb/>greater opportunities for collisions with suspended particles. <lb/>Surfactants modify the surface tension forces that typically attract, stress or disperse bioma-<lb/>terial [16]. The mechanism by which surfactants protect cells may be attributed to pluronic <lb/>masking the hydrophobic properties of the cell membrane. By design, surfactants interact with <lb/>bubbles resulting in local gradient changes in surface tension on the bubble surface so that a <lb/>bubble will slide past a cell with lowered interactions and collision efficiency [16]. Theoreti-<lb/>cally, this should inhibit bubble-cell attachment and decrease flotation efficiency. In contrast, <lb/>pluronic alone significantly improved EF concentration efficiency. Additionally, pluronic is an <lb/>amphiphilic molecule that can self-assemble into microstructure micelles [38]. Surfactant <lb/>micelles can encapsulate other molecules and have been used widely for the solubilization of <lb/>drugs and drug delivery [39]. It is conceivable that pluronic micelles formed around detectable <lb/>cell material (i.e., free DNA, lipids, cell fragments) during EF treatments. The observed <lb/>increased detection rates by LAMP may be attributed to the concentration of detectable cell <lb/>material otherwise not observed in corresponding EF treatments without pluronic. To investi-<lb/>gate this hypothesis, we ran electroflotation experiments to concentrate the equivalent of 10 3 <lb/>DNA copy number/ mL, one order of magnitude below the limit of reliable detection, of E. coli <lb/>under the same parameters described in &quot;EF treatment with pluronic and chitosan&quot;. Only 50% <lb/>of the 27 LAMP assays amplified corresponding to the detection rates of the LAMP assay <lb/>using purified DNA without electroflotation. From this we determined that it is unlikely that <lb/>cellular DNA is concentrated during flotation and therefore only whole cells or larger detect-<lb/>able cell material is recovered. <lb/>Chitosan was added to electroflotation treatments to support aggregation of dispersed bac-<lb/>teria, which can result in substantial increase in particle (i.e., bacteria) quantity recovered. <lb/>Research using chitosan as a bacterial flocculation agent for E.coli suspensions of 10 9 CFU/mL <lb/>suggests that optimal concentrations occur between 20-80 mg/g of cell dry weight depending <lb/>on other factors like pH and degree of chitosan polymerization [25]. Predicting adequate chit-<lb/>osan concentrations based on the dry weight of cells is impractical when conducting EF on <lb/>environmental samples containing unknown quantities of dispersed bacteria at low titres <lb/>(&lt;10 2 CFU/mL). In other reports optimal chitosan or polymer concentration was found to be <lb/>10-20 μg chitosan/ billion cells [21], 25-75 g chitosan/L [40] and 20 mg chitosan/ g of chlorella <lb/>[22]. It is generally agreed that small increases or decreases in polymer dosage can have a large <lb/>effect on the stabilization of the dispersed system and significantly affect the absorption rates <lb/>of the flocculant to the substrate. However, there is a lack of agreement on specific optimal <lb/>chitosan concentrations reported in literature. This can be partially attributed to the challenges <lb/></body>

			<body>and complexity of quantifying properties of a dispersed colloidal system including the dis-<lb/>agreement about the fundamental mechanism by which chitosan binds suspended solids; by <lb/>direct electrostatic bridging [41] or by destabilization of charged colloidal particles by charge <lb/>neutralization [42]. <lb/>To our knowledge, chitosan has previously been used to flocculate large quantities of bacte-<lb/>ria ranging from 10 7 -10 9 CFU/mL. This is up to 7 orders of magnitude greater than the bacte-<lb/>rial concentrations used in EF treatments in this work (10 2 −10 4 CFU/mL). To increase the <lb/>likelihood of chitosan interacting with dilute suspension of bacteria, a proportionally large <lb/>dose of chitosan proportional to bacteria was added to EF treatments. For EF treatments con-<lb/>taining ~10 2 CFU/mL E. coli, 0.01 or 0.1 g L -1 was added to flocculate ~38,000 bacterial cells <lb/>(the approximate quantity of 10 2 CFU/mL cells dispersed in 380 mL of media). <lb/>While LAMP is generally more resistant to many common PCR inhibitors, chitosan signifi-<lb/>cantly inhibited detection by LAMP. Polysaccharides commonly found in environmental sam-<lb/>ples and plant matter are well-known inhibitors of nucleic acid amplification like PCR and <lb/>competitively bind to template DNA, DNA polymerases and primer binding sites, preventing <lb/>the initiation of DNA amplification. By design, although not desirable, inhibitors that have <lb/>aggregated during flocculation may also be concentrated during EF treatments. Many com-<lb/>mon inhibitors like polysaccharides found in environmental samples behave similarly to chito-<lb/>san in that they bind to anionic particles. Our method of treating the sample with NaOH lends <lb/>itself to have compounded beneficial effects and reduce inhibition from polysaccharides found <lb/>in environmental samples. Diluting the sample can lower the concentration of inhibitors but <lb/>would reduce the final pathogen quantities in the collected fractions. For samples containing <lb/>low titers of target pathogens below the LOD of the LAMP assay this approach may be <lb/>impractical. <lb/>The addition of chitosan as a flocculant to EF treated samples completely inhibited LAMP <lb/>assays at concentration greater than 1 g L -1 . At pH less than ~6.2 and below chitosan&apos;s pKa <lb/>(~pH 9.5), chitosan has a strong positive charge and will bind to negatively charged anions <lb/>including template DNA inhibiting isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Our approach to <lb/>prevent LAMP inhibition by chitosan was adapted from a method that successfully extracted <lb/>DNA on microchips lined with chitosan coated silica beads [43]. In their system when the <lb/>buffer flowing through microchannels of the device was pH 5 DNA bound to chitosan coated <lb/>beads and eluted from the beads at pH 10. This method was particularly desirable because it <lb/>does not require downstream DNA purification or extraction methods to remove inhibitors. <lb/>The pH can be titrated in the same tube as the recovered EF sample. The crude lysis / DNA <lb/>extraction step can easily be performed in portable battery-powered kettles (i.e. Cauldryn <lb/>Smart Mug, St. Charles, MO, USA), or in handheld instrumentation for conducting LAMP <lb/>(i.e. BioRanger TM [44]) so that all methodologies in described here could be done in the field. <lb/>The EF system potentiates diverse sample preparation using a variety of sample types <lb/>including irrigation water, ocean, coastal or river samples, agricultural product rinsate, drink-<lb/>ing water, and wastewater. However, it should be noted that the electroflotation treatment con-<lb/>ditions used to achieve reliable detection of E. coli 25922 in this study were carried out under <lb/>controlled laboratory conditions and a simple buffer system. In order to apply electroflotation <lb/>as a sample preparation method in POC testing scenarios on real agricultural or environmen-<lb/>tal samples, validation and optimization would be required for each type of sample. Important <lb/>sample characteristics might include the pH of the sample, EF process settings (i.e. duration, <lb/>level of turbulence and mixing, current density), surfactant and flocculant concentrations and <lb/>optimization of a LAMP assay for each target pathogen. In some applications a pre-filtration <lb/>step may be required if the sample contains large solid particles for example water samples <lb/>containing soil or other debris and food homogenates. <lb/></body>

			<body>A single type of environmental sample matrix can contain many different bacterial strains <lb/>and/or species and therefore can host and transmit numerous types disease causing pathogens. <lb/>For example, spinach products have been linked to outbreaks of Listeria, Salmonella and E. <lb/>coli. A multiplexing LAMP assay that would allow simultaneous detection of all 3 bacterial <lb/>strains in a single reaction tube would be ideal for agricultural samples processed by electroflo-<lb/>tation, which indiscriminately concentrates and extracts any particles ranging from the size of <lb/>0.5 microns to 200 (i.e., bacterial pathogens) present in the sample matrix. While PCR multi-<lb/>plexing technology is more developed, where multiple DNA targets can be identified, LAMP <lb/>technology multiplexing assays are limited and complicated to design. The more primers that <lb/>are added to a single LAMP assay the greater occurrence of interference due to variances in <lb/>amplification efficiencies [45]. Currently to identify pathogens in an electroflotation sample by <lb/>LAMP the user would have to know what pathogen is being targeted and have primers <lb/>designed for the specific pathogen. LAMP is an ideal detection technology for agricultural <lb/>diagnostics and improvements in multiplexing technology that maintain sensitive and reliable <lb/>detection would greatly complement POC sample preparation approaches like the electroflota-<lb/>tion system described in this research. The realization of this technology is not far in the dis-<lb/>tant future as new methods to improve LAMP multiplexing continue to evolve including <lb/>multiplexing alternatives that rely on automated parallel reactions from the sample. By replac-<lb/>ing a specifically designed poly (T) region of the FIP primer with a target specific barcode by <lb/>nicking endonuclease activity, researchers at the Nanjing University School of Medicine in <lb/>China designed a four-plexed LAMP assay to detect hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human <lb/>immunodeficiency virus, and Treponema pallidum in a single LAMP reaction tube [46]. Our <lb/>lab has designed primer regions targeting spectrally unique assimilating probes so that differ-<lb/>ent targets can be distinguished, potentiating application for multiplexing technologies [30]. <lb/></body>
