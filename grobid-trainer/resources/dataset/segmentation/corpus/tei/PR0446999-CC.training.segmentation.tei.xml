			<front>Superconductivity and Magnetism in Eu 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2 <lb/>H. S. Jeevan and P. Gegenwart <lb/>I. Physik. Institut, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, D-37077 Göttingen, Germany <lb/>E-mail: jhirale@gwdg.de <lb/>Abstract. We have studied both single and polycrystalline samples of Eu 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2 with <lb/>x= 0, 0.35, 0.45 and 0.5 by means of electrical resistivity, susceptibility as well as specific heat <lb/>measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibility of single crystalline EuFe 2 As 2 , measured in fields <lb/>applied along and perpendicular to the c-axis, is isotropic. In addition to the antiferromagnetic <lb/>(AFM) spin density wave (SDW) transition at <lb/>190 K associated with the FeAs layers, the <lb/>compound undergoes another magnetic phase transition at 19 K due to AFM ordering of Eu 2+ <lb/>moments. For x = 0.5, a well defined anomaly in the specific heat related to the superconducting <lb/>(SC) transition at T c = 32 K confirms bulk superconductivity in this compound. The relative <lb/>height of the specific-heat jump is larger than the BCS value indicating strong-coupling effects. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>The discovery of superconductivity in Fe-based compounds resulted in a large number of <lb/>experimental and theoretical studies of the materials containing FeAs layers in a structural <lb/>unit [1-5]. Similar to the cuprates and heavy fermions, superconductivity in iron arsenides <lb/>emerges close to the magnetic instability. There are mainly two classes of Fe-arsenides <lb/>showing superconductivity. RFeAsO crystallizes in the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, composed <lb/>by alternating (RO) and FeAs layers. The other class of compounds belongs to the well known <lb/>ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure (so called 122 family), AFe 2 As 2 (A: Ba, Sr, Eu or Ca) [6-10] composed of <lb/>FeAs layers separated by A-layers. Superconductivity in these systems is induced by partial hole <lb/>or electron doping of the FeAs layers, which otherwise order magnetically. Electron doping has <lb/>been highly successful for RFeAsO by substitution of oxygen by fluorine or by oxide vacancies, <lb/>whereas K or Na doping is more successful for AFe 2 As 2 compounds. <lb/>EuFe 2 As 2 belongs to the so-called 122 family. We have recently performed systematic physical <lb/>property measurements on EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals and Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 polycrystals [9,11]. A <lb/>very similar magnetic transition related to Fe 2 As 2 layers was revealed in EuFe 2 As 2 and other <lb/>AFe 2 As 2 systems. EuFe 2 As 2 undergoes a SDW magnetic transition at 190 K due to Fe ordering, <lb/>accompanied by a structural transition [12]. Furthermore it also shows a second magnetic <lb/>ordering at 19 K due to Eu 2+ spin ordering. By doping Potassium to the Eu lattice (hole <lb/>doping), Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 shows the suppression of the SDW transition and the appearance <lb/>of a SC phase transition at 32 K. We have also measured the magnetic penetration depth <lb/>λ(T ) for polycrystalline samples of Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 , which shows deviations from conventional <lb/>behavior. A minimum in the penetration depth vs temperature at 4.2 K suggests a strong <lb/>influence of the Eu magnetic ordering [13] on the supercondusting properties. Additionally, <lb/>our recent Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements clearly establish the coexistence of Eu short-<lb/>range magnetic order with superconductivity in Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 samples below 4.5 K [14]. The <lb/></body>

			<body>application of pressure on EuFe 2 As 2 , results in a continuous suppression of the SDW ordering <lb/>above 2 GPa and a sharp drop in the electrical resistivity, ρ(T), which indicates the onset of <lb/>superconductivity at T c 29 K [15]. Interestingly, upon further cooling, the resistivity increases <lb/>at the Eu ordering temperature, which is nearly pressure independent. Below, we report a <lb/>detailed study on various concentrations of K doping with particular focus on temperature-<lb/>dependent specific heat measurements through the SC transition. <lb/>Single crystals of EuFe 2 As 2 were grown using the Sn-flux method [16]. The polycrystalline K-<lb/>doped samples were prepared using solid-state reaction; more details on the sample preparation <lb/>has previously been reported [11]. Electrical resistivity and specific heat were measured using <lb/>a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design, USA), while for the dc <lb/>magnetic susceptibility a Quantum Design MPMS system has been utilized. <lb/>2.

At high temperatures (T &gt; 40 K), there <lb/>is no difference between χ ab and χ c , indicating an isotropic susceptibility. In the range of 19 K to <lb/>40 K, however, a significant anisotropy in the susceptibility is found (e.g. χ ab /χ c = 1.6 at 19 K), <lb/>suggesting an anisotropic magnetic interaction between Eu spins. At 19 K, a clear drop in χ ab and <lb/>χ c indicates the AFM transition. The high-temperature data(above 200K)follow a Curie-Weiss <lb/>law (cf. lower inset of figure 1) and can be best fitted with an additional temperature independent <lb/>susceptibility χ 0 . The so-derived effective magnetic moment for both H c and H ⊥ c is close <lb/>to the theoretical value for Eu 2+ (7.94µ B ). The Weiss temperature is positive, indicating a <lb/>predominately ferromagnetic interaction between the Eu 2+ spins at high temperatures. The <lb/>Eu 2+ spins probably align ferromagnetically within the ab planes, but antiferromagnetically <lb/>along the c-axis, this is recently confirmed by neutron measurements [17].

Temperature dependence of the specific heat of polycrystalline samples of <lb/>Eu 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2 , where x= 0.0, 0.45 and 0.5. The lower inset displays C p /T vs T , which clearly <lb/>shows an anomaly at the SC transition. The upper inset displays the jump height at the SC <lb/>transition after subtracting a phonon contribution derived from the Sr compound. <lb/>change in slope in 1/χ at 190 K could be found for both field orientations (lower inset Fig.1), <lb/>which is small compared to Ba and Sr 122 compounds due to the strong Eu 2+ contribution to <lb/>the susceptibility. This anomaly in 1/χ has been identified to be due to the AFM spin density <lb/>wave (SDW) transition combined with the structural transition. S. Jiang et al. [18] observed <lb/>such a SDW transition only after subtraction of the Curie-Weiss contribution of Eu 2+ moments. <lb/>In Figure 2, we present the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for <lb/>Eu 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2 samples with x = 0.35, 0.45 and 0.5 respectively. By doping K, we found <lb/>that the maximum SC transition appears in the sample with nominal composition of x = 0.45. <lb/>In the sample of x = 0.35 and 0.5, the resistivity drop shifts to lower temperatures. The <lb/>electrical resistivity data exhibit a linear behavior above T c . The inset shows the magnetic field <lb/>dependence of the resistivity for Eu 0.55 K 0.45 Fe 2 As 2 . The small shift of the T c suggests that the <lb/>SC transition is quite robust against magnetic fields. It has to be noted, that the upper critical <lb/>fields in these materials are rather high, i.e. of the order of 50 to 60 T [19], in accordance with <lb/>recently preformed high-field resistivity measurements on Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 [20]. <lb/>The temperature dependent specific heat for x= 0, 0.45 and 0.5 is shown in Fig. 3. The broad <lb/>anomaly at the SC transition ( 32K) arises possibly due to the non-uniform distribution of the <lb/>dopant concentration. Due to a large phonon contribution at the superconductivity transition <lb/>a reliable estimation of the normal-state electronic specific heat is difficult. Additionally, there <lb/>is a magnetic contribution from Eu 2+ moments, which could not easily be subtracted from the <lb/>measured data. For this reason we are limited in the experimental determination of ∆C p /T c . <lb/>There is a clear anomaly at the SC transition for x= 0.45 and 0.5, which confirms the bulk <lb/></body>

			<body>nature of the phase transition; the AFM ordering of Eu spins is suppressed after K doping. The <lb/>SC anomaly is clearer in C p /T vs T (lower inset of Fig. 3) and a small increase in the electronic <lb/>specific heat below 10 K is due to the Eu spins. Furthermore, we have subtracted the phonon <lb/>contribution, derived from the SrFe 2 As 2 specific heat (yielding the specific heat increment δC <lb/>shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3), which gives a rough estimation of the electronic specific <lb/>heat of Eu 0.55 K 0.45 Fe 2 As 2 . Due to the substantial width of the SC transition, ∆C p /T c and T c <lb/>values were determined from this δC/T vs T plot. The estimated jump ∆C p /T c is approximately <lb/>70 mJ/mol K 2 , resulting in a ratio ∆C/(γT c ) which is substantially larger than the BCS value <lb/>of 1.43, hinting at a strong-coupling scenario. <lb/>To summarize, the magnetic susceptibility of EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals shows two AFM <lb/>transitions, related to the FeAs and Eu sublattices. The resistivity for various K dopings shows <lb/>the SC transition with a linear temperature dependence above T c . The temperature dependent <lb/>specific heat displays a clear anomaly at the SC transition with a large jump height of almost <lb/>70 mJ/mol K 2 . <lb/>We acknowledge discussions with C. Geibel, Z.
