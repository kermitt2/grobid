            <body>Due to the poor performance of Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O high <lb/>temperature superconducting materials under magnetic <lb/>fields, an improvement in the flux pinning capability through <lb/>effective doping is highly desirable. Taking into account the <lb/>Josephson coupling between CuO layers, Kim et al. 1 sug-<lb/>gested that the irreversibility field H irr is inversely propor-<lb/>tional to c , the resistivity along the c axis, and d s , the <lb/>distance between adjacent CuO planes, i.e., H irr ϳ1/( c <lb/>ϫd s ). This implies that reducing the c lattice parameter or <lb/>increasing the c-axis conductivity could enhance the flux <lb/>pinning of a material. It has been well established that all the <lb/>rare earth ͑RE͒ elements can substitute into the Ca site, 2 and <lb/>all 3d metal ions can substitute into the Cu site. 3 However, <lb/>most of the doped samples to date have been polycrystalline <lb/>bulk samples, and the investigators using RE dopants were <lb/>primary concerned with T c , the metal-insulator transition <lb/>and changes of normal state properties. 2,4,5 A very successful <lb/>enhancement of the intrinsic pinning, improving J c by 2 or-<lb/>ders of magnitude over the pure crystals, has already been <lb/>achieved by Pb doping into the Bi site in the BiO layer in <lb/>Bi2212 crystals. 6 A further enhanced flux pinning has been <lb/>reported in Pb and Cr ͑in the Cu site͒ codoped Bi-2212 <lb/>crystals. 7 No flux pinning investigations have been reported <lb/>in RE element doped Bi2212 crystals. <lb/>Y 3ϩ is the only ion among all the RE elements that is <lb/>smaller than Ca 2ϩ . It has been reported that Y doping causes <lb/>a reduction in the c lattice parameter. 8 According to the Kim <lb/>model, 1 this reduction is likely to be associated with an in-<lb/>crease in flux pinning. Unfortunately, no flux pinning inves-<lb/>tigations have been done on RE-doped Bi2212, except for Y <lb/>doped crystals which were reported to have strong flux pin-<lb/>ning at a 20% doping level. 9 These results have never been <lb/>replicated, and recent research on Y-doped polycrystalline <lb/>Bi2212 has indicated that Y doping does not improve pin-<lb/>ning, despite Y causing a reduction of the c lattice <lb/>parameter. 8 Since Pb doping makes the BiO 2 layer more con-<lb/>ductive and reduces the c lattice parameter, 10 Pb codoping <lb/>into the Bi site in the BiO 2 layer will be introduced into <lb/>Y-doped Bi2212 in order to further reduce the c lattice pa-<lb/>rameter and improve or increase the c-axis conductivity. It is <lb/>expected that Pb doping will reduce any increase in resistiv-<lb/>ity along the c axis that might be due to Y dopants. Here, we <lb/>show a detailed study of superconductivity and flux pinning <lb/>in both Y and heavily Pb codoped Bi-2212 crystals. <lb/>The Pb and Y codoped Bi2212 crystals used for the ex-<lb/>periment were grown using a self-flux method. High purity <lb/>Bi 2 O 3 , PbO, SrCO 3 , CaCO 3 Y 2 O 3 , and CuO were well <lb/>mixed according to the ratio Bi:Pb:Sr:Ca:Y:Cu <lb/>ϭ1.5:0.5:2:1Ϫx:x:2 (xр0.4) and put into Al 2 O 3 crucibles. <lb/>The crystal growth was carried out in a horizontal furnace <lb/>with a large temperature gradient. The sample was first <lb/>heated up to 1000°C and held there for about 2-4 h, then <lb/>fast cooled down to 950°C ͑200°C/h͒, then slowly cooled <lb/>down to 830°C at a rate of 5-20°C/h, and finally furnace <lb/>cooled down to room temperature. The real atomic compo-<lb/>sitions of the resulting crystals were determined by energy <lb/>dispersive analysis ͑EDA͒.

			<body>were determined using x-ray diffraction ͑XRD͒. The as-<lb/>grown crystals were annealed at different temperatures in air, <lb/>argon, and oxygen atmospheres. Superconductivity of the <lb/>crystals was characterized using standard four-probe trans-<lb/>port measurements and ac susceptibility. Flux pinning prop-<lb/>erties were investigated by the Physical Property Measure-<lb/>ment System, Quantum Design. <lb/>The single crystals obtained have dimensions of 1ϫ1-<lb/>4ϫ3 mm 2 in the ab plane depending on the amplitude of the <lb/>temperature gradient. The maximum sizes of the PbϩY <lb/>codoped crystals are bigger than those grown by the floating <lb/>traveling solvent zone technique. 6 The real atomic ratios <lb/>Bi:Pbϭ1.64:0.36 and Ca:Yϭ1.95:0.05, 0.89:0.11, 0.66:0.33 <lb/>were determined by EDA for three codoped samples used in <lb/>this work. XRD measurements showed that only ͑001͒ peaks <lb/>can be observed and no extra peaks from secondary phases <lb/>can be found, as shown in Fig. 1. X-ray analysis also re-<lb/>vealed that the ͑008͒ peak shifts to high angles with increas-<lb/>ing Y content ͑Fig. 2͒. This indicates that the c lattice pa-<lb/>rameters systemically decrease as the Y doping level <lb/>increases in agreement with the fact that the size of Y 3ϩ is <lb/>smaller than Ca 2ϩ . <lb/>The transition temperatures T c of the codoped crystals <lb/>are strongly dependent upon the Y doping level. T c deter-<lb/>mined by ac susceptibility decreases from 76 to 25 K as x <lb/>increases from 0.05 to 0.3 as shown in Fig. 3. This variation <lb/>in T c with increasing Y is similar to what is seen in solely Y <lb/>doped Bi2212 polycrystalline samples. 8 A strong annealing <lb/>effect on the T c was observed for xϭ0.11 and 0.33 samples <lb/>as shown in Fig. 3. It is clearly seen that the T c for the <lb/>as-grown crystal with xϭ0.11 shifts about 20 K higher after <lb/>air annealing, indicative of an oxygen underdoped state in <lb/>the as-grown crystals. It should be noted that the ac suscep-<lb/>tibility for the as-grown crystals with xϭ0.33 is very small, <lb/>but becomes larger after annealing in air. This implies that <lb/>the superconducting volume in this sample is enhanced after <lb/>annealing. Although the temperature where the major super-<lb/>conductivity occurs in the sample after air annealing is as <lb/>low as 25 K, the onset is as high as 60 K as shown in the <lb/>inset. Resistance measurements also show that the xϭ0.33 <lb/>sample is semiconductive over a wide temperature range be-<lb/>tween 4.2 and 300 K for the as-grown state, but becomes <lb/>metallic with a T c onset of 73 K after oxygen annealing, with <lb/>a T c0 of 30 K ͑Fig. 4͒, implying a small superconducting <lb/>volume above 30 K in agreement with ac susceptibility re-<lb/>sults. <lb/>The flux pinning in the Pb and Y codoped crystals was <lb/>investigated by measuring M -H over a wide temperature <lb/>range from 15 to 70 K. A peak effect can be observed in the <lb/>codoped samples. However, at low temperatures, the peak <lb/>field is smaller than in solely Pb doped crystals and de-<lb/>creases as x increases (xϾ0.05). The peak effect for x <lb/>ϭ0.05 starts at 20 K and can persist up to 70 K with the peak <lb/>fields around 2300 Oe at 20 K, close to what is seen in <lb/>heavily Pb doped Bi-2212 crystals. Figure 5 shows a series <lb/>of M -H loops measured at different temperatures for the x <lb/>ϭ0.05 sample. This indicated that the codoped crystals have <lb/>stronger flux pinning than in the solely Y doped Bi2212 <lb/>samples. 8 <lb/>Figure 6 shows peak fields as a function of T/T c for the <lb/>xϭ0.05 sample.

			<body>sample are also shown. It can be seen that the peak effect is <lb/>present over a wide temperature range 0.25рT/T c р0.85, <lb/>behaving the same as in heavily Pb doped Bi2212 crystals. It <lb/>should be noted that the peak field at high temperatures <lb/>above T/T c Ͼ0.5 for xϭ0.05 sample is higher than in solely <lb/>Pb doped crystals, indicative of a strong pinning due to the <lb/>codoping, even at relatively high fields. <lb/>Formation and decomposition of clusters of Bi 5ϩ and/or <lb/>Pb 4ϩ units in the Bi 3ϩ 2212 matrix, which can be controlled <lb/>by changing the oxygen or Pb content, have been proposed <lb/>as causes for the appearance of the peak effect in pure or Pb <lb/>doped Bi2212 crystals. 11 It is proposed that Bi 5ϩ and/or <lb/>Pb 4ϩ rich clusters of 2212 units, which are sensitive to the <lb/>annealing or oxygen content and distribution, exist in pure or <lb/>Pb doped Bi2212 crystals. On increasing oxygen or Pb con-<lb/>tent, the amount of Bi 5ϩ and/or Pb 4ϩ ͑which are smaller <lb/>than Bi 3ϩ ͒ increases, and the c-axis parameter decreases, re-<lb/>sulting in enhanced coupling along the ͑001͒ direction. This <lb/>is supported by the observed decrease of c and shift of H irr <lb/>for high quality Bi2212 crystals with different oxygen dop-<lb/>ing states ranging from overdoping and optimum to <lb/>underdoping. 11 The observed reduction in anisotropy in <lb/>heavily Pb doped Bi2212 crystals 10 also supports our sugges-<lb/>tion. By introducing Y into Ca sites, the c-lattice parameters <lb/>are further reduced as evidenced in Fig. 2. However, the <lb/>concentration of hole carriers is also depressed due to the <lb/>injection of electrons by Y 3ϩ , 12 which may increase the re-<lb/>sistivity and in turn reduce the flux pinning since H irr <lb/>ϳ1/( c ϫd s ). Therefore, there must be a competition be-<lb/>tween the carrier concentration and interlayer interaction that <lb/>are both induced by Y 3ϩ doping. It is most likely that the <lb/>contribution to flux pinning from the decrease in hole carrier <lb/>concentration caused by Y 3ϩ is dominant over the contribu-<lb/>tion from c-lattice parameter shrinking. However, it is pos-<lb/>sible that the smaller unit cells due to Y 3ϩ doping may be <lb/>more effective as pinning centers at high temperatures com-<lb/>pared with the situation in only heavily Pb doped Bi2212 <lb/>crystals. <lb/></body>
