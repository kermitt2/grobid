Pr 1−x Ca x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (x ≈0.5) thin films have been grown on SrTiO 3 <lb/>and YSZ substrates by the pulsed laser ablation. The substrate temperature <lb/>dependence of orientation and superconducting poperties were systematically studied. <lb/>Good quality c and a-axis orientated films can be obtained on SrTiO 3 via changing <lb/>the substrate temperature solely. On YSZ, films with good c-axis orientation can be <lb/>grown, while it is hard to grow films with good a-axis orientation by changing substrate <lb/>temperature alone. The highest T C0 is about 37K, which is found in the films grown <lb/>on YSZ with a good c-axis orientation. For the films grown on STO, however, the <lb/>highest T C0 is about 35.6K with a mixed orientation of c-axis and a-axis. In most <lb/>of the superconducting films, the weak temperature dependence of the normal state <lb/>resistivity, as characterized by small R(290K)/R(50K) ≤ 2 ratios, together with a weak <lb/>localization behavior just above T C could be attributed to the essential scattering due <lb/>to the localized electronic states. The superconducting transitions in a field up to 10 <lb/>T along c-axis have been measured on a c-axis oriented film grown on SrTiO 3 . The <lb/>zero-temperature in-plane upper critical field B ab <lb/>C2 (0) is estimated from the resistivity <lb/>transition data. <lb/>PACS numbers: 81.15.Gh, 68.55.-a, 74.78.Bz, 74.72.-h <lb/>Submitted to: Supercond.

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Among the high T C cuprates, compounds with RBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (R=rare-earth elements) <lb/>structure, the so-called 123 structure, have properties which are nearly independent <lb/>of R except for R=Pr [1, 2]. Although PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Pr-123 ) can be formed, it <lb/>does not show superconductivity at low temperature and even shows no metallic <lb/>behavior[3]. There are also reports on superconductivity in Pr-123 [4, 5], however, the <lb/>bulk superconductivity of Pr-123, has to be independently verified and also the structure <lb/>of superconducting Pr-123 has to be confirmed by rigorous crystallography. Optical <lb/>study has shown that PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ is a charge transfer type insulator with a charge-<lb/>transfer gap ∆ CT ∼1.4 eV, and carriers in the chain are localized at low temperatures <lb/>and low frequencies [6]. Due to the depletion of mobile carriers, the in-plane electric <lb/>transport properties in Pr-123 could be described in terms of variable range hopping <lb/>(VRH) in the insulating region [7]. When the high-temperature cuprates are doped <lb/>with P r the superconductivity is usually suppressed [8], and often a metal-insulator <lb/>transition occurs, accompanied by the presence of complicated magnetic behavior due <lb/>to the relatively large magnetic moment of Pr ions [9]. The origin of the suppression of <lb/>superconductivity in HTSC by Pr and absence of superconductivity in Pr-123, being <lb/>of fundamental interest, may also shed light on the mechanism of high-temperature <lb/>superconductivity, since any reasonable theory should explain the effect of Pr on <lb/>superconductivity in 123 systems. <lb/>If the carriers depletion were indeed the main origin for the absence of <lb/>superconductivity in Pr-123, a simple approach could be to introduce carriers by <lb/>chemical doping. A substitution of divalent element such as Ca for Pr appears to <lb/>be a natural choice. Nevertheless no superconductivity was found in the samples with <lb/>fairly low Ca doping levels (less than 30% at ambient pressure[10, 11]). Norton et al. <lb/>successfully revived superconductivity in Pr-123 epitaxial thin films by substituting <lb/>50% of the tetravalent Pr by divalent Ca [12, 13]. And later, superconductivity <lb/>was again found in high-pressure synthesized Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples [14, 15]. <lb/>However, the influence of crystal structures on superconductivity in the thin films is <lb/>still somewhat ambiguous. For example, it is necessary to study the superconductivity <lb/>in films with different orientations systematically. And also it is important to make <lb/>a comparative study of the transport properties of thin films and that of ceramic <lb/>bulk samples. The transport properties of Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples sintered <lb/>at ambient pressure have been studied by Luszczek [16]. However, researches are <lb/>harassed by the limited Ca substitution levels and no superconductivity was observed. <lb/>Whereas, for the samples synthesized at high pressures, impurity phases seems hard <lb/>to be avoided, although the Ca content is highly improved [17]. In this article, we <lb/>report a systematical investigation on the substrate temperature dependence of film <lb/>orientation, the superconducting transition temperature and the residual-resistivity <lb/>ratio for Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ thin films grown on the substrates of SrTiO 3 and <lb/>Yttrium-stabilized ZrO 2 . The superconducting transition data of Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ <lb/></body>

			<body>epitaxial thin films measured in a magnetic field up to 10 T, applied parallel to c-axis <lb/>of the films, are analyzed. <lb/>2. Film growth and characterization <lb/>A Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ ceramic target was prepared using a conventional solid state <lb/>reaction method similar to that used to produce superconducting R-123 pellets. The <lb/>stoichiometric quantities of high-purity dry Pr 6 O 11 , CaCO 3 , BaCO 3 , and CuO powders <lb/>were ground, mixed, fired, pelletized and sintered for several times. The sintering <lb/>temperature was 930 • C. The whole process was carried out in air under an ambient <lb/>pressure. Powder X-ray diffraction indicated a predominant R-123 phase while a <lb/>small amount of BaCuO 2 could also be detected. The Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ epitaxial <lb/>thin films were grown using pulsed-laser ablation mainly on the substrates of SrTiO 3 <lb/>(STO) and Yttrium-stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ). Some LaAlO 3 (LAO) and (LaAlO 3 ) 0.3 -<lb/>(Sr 2 AlTaO 8 ) 0.7 (LSAT) substrates were also used. A silicon heater was utilized in the <lb/>film deposition, and the temperature was monitored by an infrared thermodetector <lb/>with a calibrated temperature range from 300 • C to 1200 • C. A self-made NiCr-NiAl <lb/>thermocouple was placed at the back of the heater as a temperature reference. A <lb/>LPX 300 KrF (λ =248 nm) excimer laser (Lambda Phyisk) was adopted for the film <lb/>growth. The repetition rate was 5 Hz and the fluence was about 2 J/cm 2 . The target-<lb/>substrate distance was kept at 70 mm. The films were deposited in an oxygen partial <lb/>pressure of 40 Pa, as frequently seen in the growth of YBCO. After deposition, a one-<lb/>minute holding before annealing was used for the purpose of stress relaxation. The <lb/>annealing process was carried out in 1 atm oxygen at a cooling rate around 15 o C/min <lb/>for about 10 minutes (The superconductivity of the film was found hardly dependent <lb/>on the annealing duration at this circumstance). The films were then cooled down <lb/>naturally to room temperature. The superconducting critical temperature of the films <lb/>was measured using a standard four-probe technique, with the electrodes mounted by <lb/>silver paste on the films directly. <lb/>Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results show a good consistency of the film <lb/>stoichiometry with that of the target, as expected from the pulsed-laser ablation method. <lb/>The orientation of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). On STO, <lb/>films with c-axis lying in the film plane (a-axis oriented) can be obtained by decreasing <lb/>the substrate temperature T S for about 160 o C, as compared with that for films with <lb/>c-axis perpendicular to the film surface (c-axis oriented). Typical XRD patterns for <lb/>films with c and a-axis orientation, grown at a temperature of 880 o C and 720 o C, <lb/>are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c, respectively. Films grown at an intermediate T S of <lb/>∼ 740 o C possess a structure with mixed c and a-axis orientated phases, as shown in <lb/>Fig. 1b. A weak (103) peak, which is the strongest line of the target spectrum, can <lb/>sometimes be seen as T S was further reduced. The surface profile of the films were <lb/>obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The mean roughness is around 4 nm and <lb/>20 nm in a 10×10 µm 2 area for the a and c-axis oriented films, respectively. As a <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1. <lb/>Influence of the substrate temperature T S on the orientation of <lb/>Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ thin films grown on STO. Typical XRD patterns for films <lb/>grown at T S of (a) 880 o C, (b) 765 o C, and (c) 720 o C are shown. Peaks of the <lb/>substrate are marked with a postfix &quot;s&quot;. Shown in (d) is the T S dependence of the <lb/>ratio I(005)/I(200) S and I(200)/I(200) S , where I(hkl ) is the diffraction intensity of <lb/>(hkl ) peak for the film or the substrate. <lb/>comparison, the intensity ratios of (005) and (200) of the film to (200) of the substrate, <lb/>varying with T S , are also shown in Fig. 1d. Typical resistance transitions for the films <lb/>with different orientation are shown in Fig.2. Here, the resistance of the films scaled <lb/>by the respective value at 290 K, R(290K). Label &apos;c-oriented&apos;, &apos;mixed oriented&apos; and <lb/>&apos;a-oriented&apos; of the curves corresponds to a substrate temperature of 880 o C, 790 o C <lb/>and 720 o C, respectively. The low temperature part of transition of the curves are also <lb/>zoomed in the inset of Fig.2 for a clearer view. It is evident that the film structure has <lb/>a substaintial effect on both superconducting and normal state properties of the film. <lb/>On YSZ substrates, good quality c-axis oriented films can also be obtained, as shown in <lb/>Fig. 3. The substrate temperature in such a growth process was around 900 o C, slightly <lb/>higher than that in the case of STO. It can be attributed to the 45 o rotation of the <lb/>R − 123 unit cells on YSZ. However, it was found difficult to grow a-axis films on YSZ <lb/>solely by varying T S . When T S was reduced lower than that for a-axis oriented films <lb/>grown on STO, more and more characterized peaks of the target appeared. A typical <lb/>XRD pattern for the films grown at about 700 o C is shown in Fig. 3b. We can see that <lb/></body>

Typical resistance transition of different oriented films grown on STO. The <lb/>resistance of these films are normalized to the value at 290 K, i.e., R(290K). Here, <lb/>labels with &apos;c-oriented&apos;, &apos;mixed oriented&apos; and &apos;a-oriented&apos; correspond to a substrate <lb/>temperature of 880 o C, 790 o C and 720 o C, respectively. Inset is the low temperature <lb/>part of the transition of these films. <lb/>peaks other than the (00l ) and (l 00) are shown. For substrates such as LAO and LSAT, <lb/>good quality c-axis oriented films can also be obtained. <lb/>It is found that the critical temperature changes with the substrate temperature. <lb/>Fig. 4 shows the substrate temperature T S dependence of the critical temperature for <lb/>films grown on STO. The error bar of T Conset and T C0 corresponds to the temperature <lb/>scope from 100% to 90% of ρ n , and 10% to 0 (within the resolution of the instruments <lb/>used) of ρ n , respectively. Here ρ n is the normal state resistivity, defined as the value <lb/>where the sample resistivity deviates from the linear temperature dependence near the <lb/>superconducting transition. The relationship of T C and T S for the films on YSZ is also <lb/>shown. A higher T S is necessary to grow epitaxial thin films on YSZ than on STO, due <lb/>to the larger lattice mismatch of the former. Accordingly, T C for the films on YSZ is <lb/>higher, which could also be due to a larger strain at the interface. The highest T C0 is <lb/>about 35.6 K and 37 K for the films grown on STO and on YSZ, respectively. It is <lb/>worthy to notice that on STO, films with higher T C0 are those with a structure of mixed <lb/>c-axis and a-axis oriented phases, as was reported earlier by Norton et al. [12].

			<body>films grown on YSZ, the variation tendency of the measurement data seem to suggest a <lb/>better superconductivity for the c-axis oriented films than those with a-axis orientation. <lb/>An interesting thing of the films is their metastable properties. As the solubility <lb/>of Ca in the bulk materials sintered at ambient pressure is less than 30%, metastable <lb/>properties of the target with higher Ca doping levels could be expected, as having been <lb/>pointed out by Norton et al. [13]. Sintering the bulk materials under high pressure can <lb/>raise the Ca substitution level to 70%. Superconductivity exhibits in bulks with Ca <lb/>doping level from 30% to 70%, as mentioned previously in the literature [17]. However, <lb/>the superconducting bulk materials became insulating after fired in a furnace in air at <lb/>a temperature higher than 200 o C for half an hour [18]. Comparatively, by real-time <lb/>monitoring using the reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) system, we <lb/>found that it took less than 1 minute for the film diffraction pattern to vanish, when <lb/>the film was placed in a background pressure 10 −4 Pa at a temperature higher than 200 <lb/>o C. There is nothing but some spots remained on the substrate after such a heating <lb/>process, which can be observed by the naked eyes. The spots are found insulating (The <lb/>resistance read from a multimeter is in the magnitude of MΩ). <lb/>3. Superconducting transition in a magnetic field <lb/>The in-plane resistance measurement was carried out using the standard four-probe <lb/>method on one of the c-axis oriented films grown on STO. Thickness of the film is <lb/>around 800Å. The current density used was 700 A/cm 2 . Low ohmic contacts were <lb/>made to the sample via coating the electrodes with Pt, and using silver paste to attach <lb/>gold lines to the electrodes firmly. <lb/>A part of the R − T curve measured at zero field is shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. <lb/>The critical temperature T Conset is about 47 K with a transition width about 6K (from <lb/>90% to 10% of ρ n ), which is close to other reports [12, 13, 19]. However, the film has a <lb/>smaller resistivity just above T C , ρ(T | T C ) = 357 µΩcm. From the graph we can see that <lb/>the transport behavior is metallic at high temperatures, but at temperatures just above <lb/>T c , the resistance has a very small enhancement. This should not be a contribution <lb/>from the resistance along c-axis direction, since in the film a-axis oriented phase can <lb/>be fully ruled out according to the XRD data. We would rather attribute the effective <lb/>enhancement to some kind of weak localizations, although at present we do not have <lb/>enough evidence to determine what kind of localization it is. We propose that in the <lb/>film there are some localized charge carriers, so the small enhancement is the combined <lb/>result of the free carriers itinerating and the localized carriers variable range hopping. <lb/>Superconducting transitions of the film in a field of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 T are <lb/>presented in Fig. 5a. For a more clear inspection, we plot the H-T phase diagram of the <lb/>film in Fig. 5b using the criterion 1%, 10%, 50%, 90%, and 99% of ρ n respectively. Line <lb/>1 is very close to the irreversible line and line 5 is very close to the upper critical field. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Discussions <lb/>A common feature in the film transport behavior is that the in-plane resistivity ratio <lb/>R(290K)/R(50K) is less than 2 (more precisely is 1.6) for the films grown on both <lb/>STO and YSZ, as indicated by the hollow stars in Fig. 4. Before the superconducting <lb/>transition, resistivity of these films raises slightly, suggesting a weak carrier localization. <lb/>The small resistivity slope and the localization-like behavior near the superconducting <lb/>transition temperature, which are often observed in 50% Pr doped YBCO, are almost <lb/>independent of the magnetic field strength, as being noticed from the resistivity data <lb/>at B ≤ 10 T. The weak localization behavior could be attributed mainly to the low <lb/>carrier density, as having been well shown in the underdoped YBCO and La 1−x Sr x CuO 4 <lb/>systems. In fact, Hall measurements carried out in 50% Ca-doped samples shows an <lb/>in-plane carrier density lower than that in the optimum-doped YBCO [19, 20]. The <lb/>weak temperature dependence of normal resistivity indicates an important scattering to <lb/>the electron from the localized states in the present system. The disorder of Ba and Pr <lb/>elements could contribute to such localized states, which is possible in the present film <lb/>grown in an oxygen partial pressure of 40 Pa. The Pr ions may substitute for Ba in the <lb/>lattice, similar to the Nd and Ba disorder observed in Nd 1+x Ba 2−x Cu 3 O 7 films grown at <lb/>oxygen partial pressures higher than 1 bar [21]. <lb/>So far, it is not well understood why films with a mixed orientation has a better <lb/>superconductivity than the purely oriented (c or a) films grown on STO. We may <lb/>attribute this to an improved oxygen intake process for the film of a mixed orientations. <lb/>In other words, the mobile carrier concentration may be higher in the mixed orientation <lb/>films than the purely oriented ones, as illustrated by the change of the normal state <lb/>resistivity slope in Fig.2. Another feature we have noticed is that the small enhancement <lb/>of the resistivity near T C is weakened in the mixed orientation films, and shows a nearly <lb/>linear temperature dependence of the resistivity as illustrated by the &apos;mixed oriented&apos; <lb/>line in Fig.2. And thus seems to suggest an occurrence of structural defects dependent <lb/>delocalization of the carrier. <lb/>We have made an estimate about the upper critical field B C2 from the field-<lb/>dependent superconducting transition measurements. By using the criterion of the <lb/>99% and 90% of the normal-state resistivity ρ n for the determination of B C2 , a linear <lb/>temperature dependence is obtained near T Conset with a slope dB C2 /dT estimated to be <lb/>around 3.5 T/K and 1.73 T/K for line 1 and line 2 respectively, as seen in Fig. 5b. Using <lb/>the Werthamer, Helfand, and Holenberg (WHH) [22] extrapolation to low temperatures <lb/>with B C2 (0) = 0.73(−dB C2 /dT | T =T C )T C , the zero-temperature in-plane upper critical <lb/>field is estimated to be B ab <lb/>C2 (0) ≃ 105.5 T for line 1 and B ab <lb/>C2 (0) ≃ 47.1 T for line 2. <lb/>5.

The highest T C0 is around 35.6 K and 37 K for films <lb/>grown on STO and YSZ substrates, respectively. These are consistent with the results <lb/>of superconductivity in Ca doped Pr-123 as reported by Norton et al. previously. The <lb/>films show a metastable thermostability.
