			<body>Introduction <lb/>The occurrence of the superconductivity found in the layered cobalt oxide <lb/>Na z CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O ( z~0.3 and y~1.3) by Takada et al. 1) has attracted much attention, <lb/>because it has the triangular lattice of Co atoms, in which the electrons are considered to <lb/>be strongly correlated and frustrated. The system can be obtained from Na z&apos; CoO 2 by <lb/>de-intercalating Na + ions and then, by intercalating H 2 O molecules. The transition <lb/>temperature T c is ~4.5 K. Up to now, various kinds of studies have been carried out to <lb/>investigate the mechanism of the superconductivity. 1-23) From the experimental side, <lb/>results of the specific heat ( C) measurements have been reported by several <lb/>groups, 6,10,11,13,15) and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T 1 ) 7,12,16) and the NMR <lb/>Knight shift (K) 8) have also been reported as functions of temperature T, for example. <lb/>Among these works, the exotic nature of the superconductivity is presumed by several <lb/>groups. <lb/>From the theoretical side, a possible role of the interband excitations has been pointed <lb/>out in the Cooper pair formation in ref. 23. The resemblance of the electronic nature <lb/>with possible strong fluctuations of this frustrated lattice to that of high-T c oxides is <lb/>emphasized by several authors 17,20) , and a possibility of the triplet pairing is also <lb/>conceived by other groups. 18,19,21) In the previous report, 7) the present authors ha ve <lb/>shown by 59 Co-NQR studies of the system, that the coherence peak of the 59 Co-nuclear <lb/>spin relaxation rate 1/T 1 observed by NQR exists just below T c even though it is much <lb/>smaller than that expected for ordinary s-wave superconductors. We have also reported 8) <lb/>the NMR Knight shift observed for a peak of the NMR spectra, corresponding to the <lb/>crystallites oriented with their y-axes within the c-planes being parallel to the external <lb/>magnetic field H. Based on these results, we have pointed out that the superconducting <lb/>pairs can probably be considered to be in the singlet state, unless we do not consider a <lb/>situation where spins of triplet pairs are pinned along the direction perpendicular to the <lb/>y-axis. We have also pointed out that the symmetry may be s-like or fully gapped one <lb/>and added that other kinds of symmetry, ( d+id)-symmetry, for example, cannot be <lb/>excluded. Even if the symmetry is s-like, it does not necessarily indicate that the <lb/>superconductivity is not exotic, because the s-like symmetry or the fully gapped state <lb/>may be realized by the pairing mediated by the interband excitations of the electrons. 23) <lb/>Another possible way to study the pair symmetry is to examine an effect of the <lb/>impurity-doping on the superconducting transition temperature of the system: The pair <lb/>breaking effect of nonmagnetic impurities is negligible in ordinary s-wave <lb/>superconductors, while it can be large as in the case of magnetic impurities in usual <lb/>s-wave superconductors, if the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter has <lb/></body>

			<body>nonzero angular momentum l as the p-or d-wave one. For nonzero l, the absolute initial <lb/>slope |dT c /dx| is proportional to the scattering rate 1/τ of the electrons by the impurities. <lb/>(The relation is described by the pair breaking theory.) 24) Then, if impurities are in the <lb/>path of the conducting electrons, |dT c /dx| is expected to be very large. Because this <lb/>T c -suppression is expected essentially not to be observed, as stated above, for <lb/>non-magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors, we may have a good way to <lb/>distinguish if the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter has non-zero l or <lb/>not. <lb/>Experiments <lb/>Polycrystalline samples of Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 (M=Ir and Ga) were prepared by solid <lb/>reactions at 750 ~850 °C for 24~36 hours, where the nominal value z&apos; was 0.7 or 0.75, <lb/>depending on series of samples. All samples of Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 (M=Ir and Ga) thus <lb/>obtained were found to have the CdI 2 structure (P6 3 /mmc) by X-ray powder diffraction <lb/>with FeKá radiation, where any impurity phases have not been observed for the small <lb/>values of the nominal concentration x studied here. The lattice parameter c determined <lb/>by the X-ray studies changed systematically with x for M=Ir, which guarantees that the <lb/>substitution is successfully carried out. For M=Ga, the lattice parameter c exhibits rather <lb/>large scattering as a function of x. However, because it shows, roughly speaking, a <lb/>decreasing tendency with increasing x and because the resistivity ρ and the transition <lb/>temperature T c of the system exhibit, as shown later, systematic x dependence, it can be <lb/>considered that the substitution is carried out. (In the actual experiments, besides M=Ir <lb/>and Ga, several atomic elements such as Cu and Al, for example, were tried to substitute <lb/>for Co. But, we could not find a firm experimental evidence that these elements really <lb/>substitute for Co: The lattice parameter did not show systematic dependence on the <lb/>nominal value x. The absolute value and the T-dependence of the resistivity ρ did not <lb/>change systematically with x, either. (The superconduting transition temperature was <lb/>almost independent of the nominal values of x.) Then, the obtained data of the doping <lb/>dependence of T c on x are, we think, reliable only for M=Ir and Ga. (For M=Rh, the data <lb/>may also be reliable.) and here these data are presented. <lb/>We employed a &quot;rapid heat-up&quot; technique to avoid the Na evaporation. 25) For each <lb/>sample series obtained through a single series of the processes, the c values were <lb/>determined by using 5-6 lines between the scattering angles of 20-90º, and the results <lb/>are shown in Figs. 1 and 5 for M=Ir and Fig. 9 for Ga. The c values at x=0 are found to <lb/>be different among these series probably due to the difference of the real Na <lb/>concentration, which depends on the preparation conditions such as the sintering <lb/></body>

			<body>temperature T a . (The lattice parameter c decreases with the Na concentration. 25) ) For <lb/>each series of samples, c increases with increasing x. The lattice parameter a is rather <lb/>insensitive to x. The resistivity ρ of Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 was measured by the four terminal <lb/>method. These samples were dried at 150~800 °C before the measurements. <lb/>Na z Co 1-x M x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O was prepared from the Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 as follows. Na atoms are <lb/>de-intercalated by dipping the Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 sample into acetonitrile, in which Br − ions <lb/>are dissolved. Then, the sample was washed by distilled water. In this process, H 2 O <lb/>molecules are intercalated. The magnetic susceptibilities χ of the samples were <lb/>measured by SQUID magnetometer with the magnetic field H of 5 G in the conditions <lb/>of the zero-field-cooling (ZFC). <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Here, we present results of the studies on two series of Ir-doped system and a series <lb/>of Ga-doped system. For each series, experimental data of the lattice parameters c and <lb/>the electrical resistivities ρ of Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 , are shown. The magnetic susceptibilities <lb/>χ due to the shielding diamagnetism and the superconducting transition temperatures T c <lb/>of Na z Co 1-x M x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O derived from these series are also shown. <lb/>(1) Series A of Ir-doped system <lb/>For this series, the nominal value of z&apos; is 0.75. Figures 1 and 2 show the lattice <lb/>parameters c and the electrical resistivities ρ of Na z&apos; Co 1-x Ir x O 2 , respectively. As stated <lb/>above, the lattice parameter exhibits the systematic x-dependence, indicating that the <lb/>Ir-substitution for Co is really carried out. The electrical resistivity ρ also exhibits the <lb/>systematic x-dependence and it becomes insulating at x as small as 0.02. The <lb/>diamagnetic susceptibilities χ and the superconducting transition temperatures T c of <lb/>Na z Co 1-x Ir x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O obtained by intercalating H 2 O to the samples of Na z&apos; Co 1-x Ir x O 2 are <lb/>shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The values of T c are determined by using the <lb/>observed χ-T curves as the temperatures, at which the absolute values of χ exceeds a <lb/>certain value with decreasing T. (The parentheses in Fig. 4 indicate large ambiguities of <lb/>the data points.) The x-dependence seems to be linear and the slope |dT c /dx| is estimated <lb/>to be ∼1.0 K/%. <lb/>(2) Series B of Ir-doped system <lb/>For this series, the nominal value of z&apos; is 0.75, too. Figures 5-8 show the data taken <lb/>for the series B of Ir-doped system similar to those in Figs. 1-4, respectively. The <lb/>variations of c and ρ with x are, roughly speaking, systematic. For this series of samples, <lb/>the shielding diamagnetisms are smaller than those observed for the series A. The value <lb/>of T c at x=0 is larger than that of the series A. However, the initial slope |dT c /dx| is <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>almost equal to the value observed for the series A. Then, we think that even though the <lb/>magnitudes of the shield ing diamagnetism are different between two series of A and B, <lb/>we are observing intrinsic behavior of the T c -x curve. <lb/>(3) Series of Ga-doped system <lb/>For this series, the nominal value of z&apos; is 0.7. Results are shown in Figs.9-12, as in <lb/>the cases of the Ir-doping. Although the increase of dρ/dT with increasing x found in <lb/>Fig.10 may not be explained by the simple Matthiessen&apos;s law, we have found almost <lb/>systematic x-dependences of ρ and T c . Then, the substitution of Ga for Co is, we think, <lb/>really carried out. In this system, the slope |dT c /dx| is ~2.0 K/%, which is about two <lb/>times larger than the values obtained for the two series of Na z Co 1-x Ir x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O. <lb/>We have so far presented the experimental data for three series of Na z&apos; Co 1-x M x O 2 <lb/>and Na z Co 1-x M x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O (M=Ir and Ga). Because T c has been found to be, roughly <lb/>speaking, linear in x in the region of small x, the pair breaking theory, which can be <lb/>described by <lb/>ln{T c (0)/T c (x)}=ψ{1/2+h/(2ηπk B T c (x)τ)} −ψ(1/2) <lb/>≡ ψ(1/2+α/2t) −ψ(1/2) <lb/>might be applicable to the present systems, where the pair breaking parameter α≡ <lb/>h/{ηπk B T c (0)τ}, t ≡T c (x)/T c (0), 1/τ is the scattering rate by the impurities and ψ(x) is the <lb/>digamma function. (By using the electron mean free path Λ~v F τ and the coherence <lb/>length ξ (=hv F /π∆ in the BCS theory), α is written as 1.76ξ/Λη, where v F and ∆{= <lb/>1.76k B T c (0)} are the Fermi velocity and the superconducting gap at x=T=0, <lb/>respectively.) The η value is equal to unity for the spin scattering by magnetic <lb/>impurities in s-wave superconductors and it is equal to 2 for both the potential and spin <lb/>scatterings by impurities when the order parameter has nonzero angular momentum l (If <lb/>l=0, α=0 for non-magnetic impurities and T c is not suppressed.). <lb/>Figure 13 shows the magnetic susceptibilities χ of the samples of Na z&apos; Co 1-x Ir x O 2 <lb/>(series B) with different x. Because the data do not indicate the increase of the number <lb/>of magnetic moments with increasing x, the impurities can be considered to be <lb/>non-magnetic, which is naturally expected, because non-magnetic Co atoms are <lb/>substituted with the isoelectronic Ir atoms or with Ga atoms which have only s and p <lb/>outer electrons. If the superconducting gap parameter has the s-wave symmetry, T c <lb/>should not, in an ideal case, be suppressed by the present doping. <lb/>It is interesting to compare the values of |dT c /dx| with those of other systems. In Fig. <lb/></body>

			<body>14, we summarize the T c -x curves obtained in the present experiments together with <lb/>those of well known systems, La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 <lb/>26) with the d-wave order parameter <lb/>and Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 with the s-wave one. 27) The slopes |dT c /dx| observed for the present <lb/>sample series have the values similar to that of the Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 system and much <lb/>smaller than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 . It may be also useful to note that the values <lb/>of |dT c /dx| observed for the spinel system Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 are ~0.9 and ~0.6, for M=Rh <lb/>and Ir, respectively. 28) The system is considered to have the s-wave order parameter <lb/>from the existence of a significant coherence peak in the T-dependence of the nuclear <lb/>relaxation rate divided by T, 1/T 1 T. 29) It has the three dimensional network of the <lb/>corner-sharing (Co 1-x M x ) 4 and can be considered to be a three dimensional version of the <lb/>triangular lattice. For this system, |dT c /dx| is more than a half of that of <lb/>Na z Co 1-x Ir x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O. From these results, it is tempting to consider that the present <lb/>system has the s-wave order parameter and that the linear relationship between T c and x <lb/>is just caused by a mechanism different from the pair breaking due to the scattering by <lb/>non-magnetic impurities. <lb/>On the other hand, within the framework of the pair breaking theory, the relations <lb/>{T c (0)-T c (x)} ~πh/4ηk B τ~π 2 T c (0)α(x)/4~0.44π 2 (ξ/Λη)×T c (0) hold in the region of small <lb/>x (Note that ξ×T c (0) does not depend on T c (0). ). To explain the initial slope |dT c /dx| ~1 <lb/>K/%, ξ/(Λη)= hv F /{1.76πk B T c (0)}/( v F τ) should be of the order of ~1/20. If ξ is chosen <lb/>to be ~100 Å, 10) Λ has to be as large as 1000 Å at x=0.01, which seems to be too large as <lb/>compared with the average separation of neighboring impurities (~30 Å). The much <lb/>smaller values of |dT c /dx| for the present systems than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 do <lb/>not seem to be easily understood only by the naive consideration of the pair breaking by <lb/>non-magnetic impurities, either <lb/>Then, what is the primary mechanism of the observed T c suppression? It is, roughly <lb/>speaking, to be linear in x, but the rate |dT c /dx| seems to be too small to understand by <lb/>the pair breaking mechanism. We may have to ask why Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 with the <lb/>s-symmetry of the order parameter exhibits the linear T c -decrease in x, 28) because the <lb/>similar origin of the T c suppression may be relevant to the present case. For example, <lb/>effects of the carrier localization on T c may be considered as one of possible origins, <lb/>because for M=Ir, the relatively small amount of the doping to the host material <lb/>Na z&apos; CoO 2 seems to induce the upturn of the resistivity with decreasing T (see Figs. 2 and <lb/>6). <lb/>Before summarizing the results of the present study, we also add followings. 30) The <lb/>Knight shifts K y studied as functions of T at several fixed H values (1.5 T ≤ H ≤ 4.5 T) <lb/>indicate that the spin susceptibility decreases with decreasing T below T c . The H-and <lb/></body>

			<body>T-dependences of K y cannot be explained by considering the superconducting <lb/>diamagnetism, as reported in our previous paper. 8) The magnetic field H c2 determined <lb/>from the T dependence of K y reproduces the H c2 -T curve for H applied within the c <lb/>plane reported in ref. 10. The H c2 value at T→0 can be understood by the effect of the <lb/>Zeeman splitting on singlet pairs, indicating again that the superconducting pairs are <lb/>definitely in the singlet state. It gives a restriction that the pairs have even parity. <lb/>In order to fully understand the observed values of |dT c /dx|, we have to examine <lb/>various quantities and study the electronic state of the present system in detail. In <lb/>summary, we have presented the results of the studies on the impurity-doping effects on <lb/>T c of Na z CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O and shown that the values of |dT c /dx| are ~1 K/%, which is too <lb/>small to be explained by the pair breaking mechanism for the anisotropic (l≠0) order parameters <lb/>by non-magnetic impurities. <lb/></body>
