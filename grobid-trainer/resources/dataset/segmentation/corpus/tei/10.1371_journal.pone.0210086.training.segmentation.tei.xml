			<body>Introduction <lb/>Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in <lb/>developing countries and evidence suggests that iron deficiency is the most common cause of <lb/>nutritional anemia in the world [1,2]. Anemia during pregnancy diagnosed as hemoglobin <lb/>concentration less than 11 g/dl for mild anemia, between 7-9.9 g/dl for moderate anemia and <lb/>less than 7g/dl considered as severe anemia and usually caused by iron deficiency [3]. <lb/>Globally, 1.62 billion people suffered from anemia that accounts for 24.8% of the world&apos;s <lb/>population. It is estimated that 56.4 million pregnant women affected by anemia and Africa <lb/>account for 17.2 million pregnant women affected by anemia [4]. According to the WHO 2012 <lb/>report, more than 40% of worldwide pregnant women were anemic. Among this, 50% of the <lb/>burden is caused by iron deficiency [5]. In Ethiopia, 31.7% of pregnant women were anemic <lb/>[6], and other several studies in Ethiopia reviled that there is a high prevalence of anemia dur-<lb/>ing pregnancy [7-9]. According to 2016 Ethiopian demographic health survey report, 24% of <lb/>reproductive age group women was anemic [10]. Overall, anemia contributes to 18% of peri-<lb/>natal mortality, 19% of preterm births, and 12% of low birth weight in low and middle-income <lb/>countries [11]. <lb/>Anemia during pregnancy has a significant adverse effect both on the mother and fetus <lb/>[12]. So far, micronutrient deficiency of iron and folic acid during pregnancy are the most risk <lb/>factors for anemia and this contributes to the poor neonatal health and increased maternal <lb/>mortality [13]. Iron and folic acid is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world <lb/>particularly among pregnant women especially in developing countries [14]. <lb/>Daily 30mg to 60mg of iron and 0.4mg folic acid is highly recommended for pregnant <lb/>women to prevent maternal anemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight, neural tube defect, and <lb/>preterm birth. Daily iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS) during pregnancy reduced <lb/>the risk of all types of maternal anemia at term by 70% and iron deficiency anemia at term by <lb/>57% [5]. According to 19 African countries, national demographic health survey dataset analy-<lb/>sis evidenced that, IFAS during pregnancy for 90 days can reduce the risk of neonatal mortality <lb/>by 34% [15,16]. <lb/>In Ethiopia, several studies evidenced that there is poor adherence of prenatal IFAS during <lb/>antenatal period [17-19] but there is no study to show the magnitude of IFAS in worldwide <lb/>and Africa. Ethiopian demographic health survey of 2016 showed that only 5% pregnant moth-<lb/>ers took an iron with a folic acid tablet for 90 days and 58% of pregnant mothers did not take <lb/></body>

			<body>any iron with a folic acid tablet during their time of pregnancy [10]. Poor adherence of IFAS is <lb/>associated with low utilization of antenatal care services, inadequate supply of IFA tablets, <lb/>poor counseling and lack of knowledge on anemia [20,21]. However, IFAS is highly recom-<lb/>mended for anemia control and prevention [22] but in Ethiopia, the adherence and coverage <lb/>to IFAS are still very low. [10]. Furthermore, there are limited studies conducted to address the <lb/>issue of adherence of IFAS and its associated factors in the study area. Therefore, the result of <lb/>this study will provide invaluable information on IFAS adherence and its associated factors for <lb/>policy makers and health planners. <lb/>The aim of this study was to assess adherence to IFAS and its associated factors among <lb/>pregnant women in Debre Tabor General Hospital. <lb/>Methods and participants <lb/>Study setting and subjects <lb/>An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Debre Tabor General Hospital <lb/>from January 09-April 08/2017. Debre Tabor General Hospital is found in Debre Tabor <lb/>Town, South Gondar Zone of Amhara Regional state which is about 667 kilometers away from <lb/>Addis Ababa in Northwest direction and 102 kilometers far from Bahir Dar. The Hospital <lb/>offers health services including maternal and child health services. Some of these are inpatient, <lb/>outpatient, neonatal intensive care, TB/ leprosy, antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and <lb/>family planning services. <lb/>All pregnant women who had at least two visits of Antenatal care for current pregnancy at <lb/>Debre Tabor General Hospital and previously supplemented with 60mg iron with 0.4mg folic <lb/>acid tablets for at least one month before the date of interview was included while pregnant <lb/>women with mental disorder, unable to hear and/or speak, and very sick were excluded from <lb/>the study. <lb/>A total of 262 study participants were included into this study after adding 5% of none <lb/>response rate. This sample size was calculated by using single population proportion formula <lb/>by considering the expected prevalence of adherence to IFAS among pregnant women was <lb/>20.4% from the study done in Mecha district [18], 95% of confidence level, and 5% of marginal <lb/>error. Systematic random sampling was employed to select the study participants. First, we <lb/>estimate the number of ANC service users for the previous three consecutive months which <lb/>was 1502. Then, we calculated the K th interval and which was 6. Finally, we interviewed the <lb/>study participants at every six intervals among ANC service users. <lb/>Data collection procedure <lb/>The data collectors were 5 diploma nurses. The data were collected by using face to face <lb/>interview and chart review through structured interviewer-administered questionnaire <lb/>under the supervision of 2 health officers. The questionnaire was developed after a review of <lb/>the different kind of literature. The questionnaire was first developed in English. This ques-<lb/>tionnaire translated into Amharic and then translated back into English by a different per-<lb/>son to check its consistency. Two days training was given for data collectors and supervisors. <lb/>The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the sample size before the actual data collection <lb/>period. The training was given for the data collectors and supervisors. All pregnant women <lb/>were checked for anemia as ANC client and we assessed the anemia by reviewing clients <lb/>chart. The filled questionnaires were checked for completeness and consistency by the <lb/>supervisors. <lb/></body>

			<body>Operational definitions <lb/>Adherence to IFAS: Mothers were said to adhere to IFAS if they took 65% or more of the sup-<lb/>plement, equivalent to taking the supplement at least 4 days a week during the 1-month period <lb/>preceding the study [23]. <lb/>Good Knowledge About IFAS:-Those who score above 4 questions prepared to assess <lb/>comprehensive knowledge of IFAS of the respondents [23]. <lb/>Data processingand analysis <lb/>All the interviewed questionnaires were checked manually for completeness and consistency. <lb/>Data were coded and entered by using EpiData version 3.1 software. Double entry was made. <lb/>The entered data were exported into the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version <lb/>20 software for further analysis. The analysis was conducted in several steps. First, simple <lb/>descriptive statistics such as a frequency distribution and percentages were performed to <lb/>describe the demographic, socioeconomic, and obstetric characteristics of the respondents. <lb/>Second, a bivariate logistic regression was performed for each independent variable with the <lb/>outcome variable. A variable whose bivariate test had a p-value &lt;0.2 was a considered as a can-<lb/>didate for the multivariable model. Once the variables were identified, multivariable analysis <lb/>was conducted. Hosmer and Lemeshow&apos;s goodness-of-fit test was used to check the appropri-<lb/>ateness of the data for multiple logistic regression. Finally, a multivariable logistic regression <lb/>model was done to determine independent predictors of adherence status to IFAS. Crude and <lb/>adjusted odds ratios together with their corresponding 95% of confidence intervals were com-<lb/>puted to see the strength of association. All tests were two-sided and P &lt; 0.05 was considered <lb/>to declare statistical significance. Finally, the result was presented by tables. <lb/>The study was conducted after getting an ethical clearance letter from the institutional ethi-<lb/>cal review committee of Debre Tabor University. The data were collected after obtaining a per-<lb/>mission letter from the Debre Tabor General Hospital. Informed consent was secured from <lb/>each study participants and personal identifiers were excluded during the data collection to <lb/>assure confidentiality. <lb/>Results <lb/>Socio-demographic characteristics of study participants <lb/>A total of 241 study participants were involved with a response rate of 92%. A large proportion <lb/>of the study participants were within the age range of 25-29 years (35%) and almost all were <lb/>orthodox (91%) religion followers. Majority of the respondents were married (69%) and hav-<lb/>ing a family size of 4-6 (61%) as shown in the table below (Table 1). <lb/>Reproductive health characteristics of study participants <lb/>Out of 241 study participants, 55% had an experience of more than one pregnancy. A large <lb/>proportion of pregnant women (49%) were Nullipara. About seventy-four percent (74%) of <lb/>respondents were in their third trimester of the pregnancy during the data collection period. <lb/>Majority of study participants (65%) came before 16 weeks of gestational age for their first <lb/>ANC visit. Seventy-three percent of pregnant women attended three to four ANC visit whereas <lb/>the rest had only two ANC visits. Majority of the study participants (61%) had not been <lb/>advised about the use of IFAS. Most pregnant women (81%) had a history of anemia in their <lb/>lifetime and 28% of pregnant women had anemia currently. Nearly half (52%) of the study par-<lb/>ticipants were knowledgeable about IFAS (Table 2). <lb/></body>

			<body>Associated factors of adherence to IFAS <lb/>In bivariate logistic regression gravidity, parity, having child, gestational age at first ANC visit, <lb/>getting advice about IFAS, current anemia, and knowledge about IFAS were significantly asso-<lb/>ciated with adherence to IFAS during pregnancy. <lb/>In multivariable logistic regression gravidity, gestational age at first ANC visit, getting <lb/>advice about IFAS, current anemia, and knowledge about IFAS were significantly associated <lb/>with adherence to IFAS during pregnancy. Multigravida mothers were 2.92 times more likely <lb/>to be adherent to IFAS than Primigravida mothers (AOR = 2.92, 95%CI (1.61, 5.30)). Pregnant <lb/>women who had first ANC visit before 16 weeks of gestational age were 3.67 times more likely <lb/>to be adherent to IFAS than those pregnant women who had first ANC visit after 16 weeks of <lb/>gestational age (AOR = 3.67, 95% CI (1.94,6.97)). Mothers who got advice about IFAS were <lb/>2.04 times more likely to be adherent to IFAS than those who didn&apos;t get advice (AOR = 2.04, <lb/>95%CI (1.12, 3.75)). Pregnant mothers who had anemia currently were 2.22 times more likely <lb/>to be adherent to IFAS than those pregnant mothers who don&apos;t have anemia (AOR = 2.22, <lb/>95%CI (1, 15, 4.29)). Pregnant women who had knowledge about IFAS were 3.27 times more <lb/>likely to be adherent to IFAS than those who didn&apos;t have knowledge (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI <lb/>(1.80, 5.95)) as shown in the table below (Table 3). <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in <lb/>developing countries. Pregnant women are one of the vulnerable populations to develop iron <lb/>deficiency anemia. The World Health Organization recommends IFAS to all pregnant women <lb/>a standard dose of 30mg-60mg iron and 400μg folic acid daily throughout pregnancy [5]. <lb/>Pregnant women adherence to IFAS plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of iron <lb/>deficiency anemia. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to IFAS and its associated fac-<lb/>tors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor General Hospital. <lb/>The result of this study revealed that 44% of pregnant women were adherent to IFAS which <lb/>is consistent with a study done at Egypt (41%), Misha district (39%) and Bahir Dar (42%) [24-<lb/>26]. On the other side, it is higher than the study done at Uganda (12%), Kenya (33%), Goba, <lb/>Southeast Ethiopia (18%) and Mecha district (20%) [17,18,27,28]. The possible reasons might <lb/>be the study setting and time which means our study was Hospital-based and recent whereas <lb/>their studies were community-based. It was lower than the study conducted at South India <lb/>(64%), Akaki Kality, Addis Ababa (60%), Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia (55%), Assella (60%) <lb/>and Mizan Aman (71%) [29-33]. The possible justification might be urbanization, accessibility <lb/>to health services and awareness towards IFAS. <lb/>This study showed that gravidity had a significant association with adherence to IFAS. Mul-<lb/>tigravida mothers were 2.92 times more likely to be adherent to IFAS than Primigravida moth-<lb/>ers. This is consistent with the study done in India and Assella [30,31] whereas it is not similar <lb/>to the study done at Kenya and Misha district [25,27], which showed that gravidity had no <lb/>association with IFAS adherence. The possible justification could be multigravida mothers <lb/>might have higher knowledge, awareness, and experience of nutritional anemia due to their <lb/>repeated visit to health facilities. <lb/>Our study indicated that gestational age at first ANC visits is a predictor of adherence to <lb/>IFAS. Pregnant women who had first ANC visit before 16 weeks of gestational age were 3.67 <lb/>times more likely to be adherent to IFAS than those pregnant women who had first ANC visit <lb/>after 16 weeks of gestational age. It is in line with the study done at the Western Zone of <lb/>Tigray, Assella and Mizan Aman [19,30,33]. The possible justification might be pregnant <lb/>women who registered early for ANC service could acquire a better knowledge of perceived <lb/>risk and benefit of IFAS to prevent anemia during pregnancy. <lb/>In addition, our study presented that advice about IFAS had statistical significance with <lb/>IFAS adherence status. Pregnant women who got advice about IFAS were 2.04 times more <lb/>likely to be adherent to IFAS than those who didn&apos;t get advice. This is similar to the study done <lb/>at Uganda, Misha district and Mizan Aman [25,28,33]. The possible reason may be getting <lb/>advice may increase the level of knowledge, attitude and practice towards IFAS adherence. <lb/>The present study revealed that anemia during current pregnancy is a predictor of adher-<lb/>ence to IFAS. Pregnant mothers who had anemia currently were 2.22 times more likely to be <lb/>adherent to IFAS than those pregnant mothers who didn&apos;t have anemia. It is consistent with <lb/>the study conducted in the northwestern zone of Tigray, India, and Mecha district [18,19,31]. <lb/>The possible justification may be the perceived risk of complication of anemia may be high in <lb/>pregnant women who have current anemia. <lb/>Furthermore, this study indicated that knowledge about IFAS has an association with <lb/>adherence to IFAS. Pregnant women who had knowledge about IFAS were 3.27 times more <lb/>likely to be adherent to IFAS than those who didn&apos;t have knowledge about IFAS. It is similar to <lb/>the study dine at Mecha district, Misha district, and Goba district [17,18,25]. The reason may <lb/>be knowledge will increase the level of awareness about IFAS and in turn, it will increase the <lb/>attitude and practice towards adherence of IFAS. <lb/></body>

			<body>Limitation of the study <lb/>All knowledge item questions answers were yes and the data collectors were nurses. So, these <lb/>may introduce social desirability bias. The other limitation of this study is we didn&apos;t assess the <lb/>side effects of the iron with folic acid tablet but it may have an impact on the adherence rate of <lb/>IFAS. <lb/>Conclusion and recommendation <lb/>Adherence of IFAS among pregnant women was low. Gravidity, gestational age at first ANC <lb/>visit, advice about IFAS, current anemia, and knowledge about IFAS were independent predic-<lb/>tors of adherence to IFAS. Health professionals shall provide health information for all ANC <lb/>service users in the regular base during counseling session of ANC visit about the benefit of <lb/>IFAS to prevent maternal anemia and its consequence by enhancing adherence to IFAS.
