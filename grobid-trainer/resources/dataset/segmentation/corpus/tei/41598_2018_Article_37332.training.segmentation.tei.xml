Results indicated that major mycobacterial species were related to M. brumae, M. <lb/>crocinum, M. sphagni, etc., most of which belong to poorly characterized rapidly-growing group. A <lb/>few opportunistic pathogenic species were detected, suggesting the potential risk of mycobacteria in <lb/>WWTPs. Genomic analysis of four isolates from activated sludge indicated these genomes contained <lb/>genes of degradations of alkane, aromatics, steroids and a variety of cytochrome P450 families. <lb/>Additionally, a few key genes responsible for cholesterol degradation were detected in a full-scale <lb/>activated sludge metatranscriptomic dataset reported previously and taxonomically assigned to <lb/>mycobacteria. Evidence showed that all isolates can degrade cholesterol, a major composition of <lb/>sewage. Relative abundance of mycobacteria in activated sludge was enriched by 4.7 folds after adding <lb/>cholesterol into the influent for one week. Our results provided the insights into mycobacterial species <lb/>and functions in WWTPs. <lb/></front>

			<body>Mycobacterium is one of the most significant disease-causing and environmental bacterial genera ubiquitously <lb/>distributing in aqueous environments 1-4 . For biological wastewater treatment, Mycobacterium has been branded <lb/>as one of the foaming bacteria in activated sludge (AS) due to its high hydrophobic cell surface and enrichment <lb/>in the foam 5 . However, very few mycobacterial isolates have been obtained from the wastewater treatment plants <lb/>(WWTPs). Recently, the high throughput sequencing techniques revealed that this genus frequently was pres-<lb/>ent at high abundance in the global WWTPs, especially in municipal WWTPs 6,7 . Mycobacterium species in AS <lb/>accounted for 0.2% to 4% in terms of the 16S rRNA gene abundance, ranging the 2nd to 60th among all classified <lb/>bacterial genera 7 . Moreover, their relative abundances in terms of cell number could be even higher considering <lb/>the low copy number (typically 1 or 2 copies) of the rRNA operon in their genomes 8 . These preliminary obser-<lb/>vations raise the significance to study which Mycobacterium species dominate and what are their roles in the AS <lb/>treatment. On the one hand, the occurrence of pathogenic mycobacteria in WWTPs has not been systematically <lb/>studied although some case reports were occasionally presented 9 . On the other hand, resolving their roles will <lb/>help us to further understand the mycobacterial functions in aspects of biotechnology in WWTPs. <lb/>Besides of its pathogenic role like causing tuberculosis, lung disease, ulcer, etc., Mycobacterium is of envi-<lb/>ronmental significance due to degradation capabilities for aromatic hydrocarbons 10,11 , nitrogen-containing <lb/>heterocycles, such as morpholines 12 , etc. For example, so far mycobacterial species are the solely reported degrad-<lb/>ers for morpholine, an important industrial intermediate of wide application 13 . In addition, like some other <lb/>Actinobacteria, many Mycobacterium spp. are capable of degrading or transforming steroids 14-16 , which are the <lb/>typical human fecal components. The sterols, mostly in the form of derivatives of cholesterol, could be as high as <lb/></body>

			<body>several milligrams per gram dry weight level in insoluble form in sewage 17,18 , and are considered as important <lb/>pollutants due to their estrogenic effects on aquatic invertebrates 19 . <lb/>Numerous studies focused on the species or strains identification of the clinical mycobacterial isolates 20-22 . <lb/>Many species share the very high similar 16S rRNA gene sequences similarities but the low genomic DNA hybrid-<lb/>ization ratios that indicated that they were distinct organisms 23,24 . So far, partial DNA sequences of rpoB (the β <lb/>subunit of RNA polymerase) and hsp65 (the 65 kD heat-shock protein) have been proven to be robust methods <lb/>for species-level mycobacterial identification of isolates and environmental samples 25,26 . <lb/>In this study, we aimed to characterize the major mycobacterial species and their potential functions in <lb/>WWTPs. Mycobacterial species, including potential pathogens, were investigated based on profiling the rpoB <lb/>sequences. Moreover, genomes from four isolates were obtained to get the characteristics of their biodegrada-<lb/>tion potentials. A major role of mycobacteria for degradation of cholesterol in WWTPs was proposed based on <lb/>genome annotation, evidence from a full-scale AS metatranscriptomic dataset published previously and further <lb/>validation by degradation tests with the isolates and enriching mycobacteria in AS by adding cholesterol. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Samples preparation and mycobacterial isolation. The AS samples were collected from the aer-<lb/>ation tanks of 11 WWTPs located in five countries. The influents and effluents of two WWTPs from Hong <lb/>Kong (China) were simultaneously sampled. The detailed information including the relative abundance of <lb/>Mycobacterium for the 16 samples (including a technical duplication for CN-BJ AS sample) was summarized in <lb/>Table S1. The AS samples were fixed by 50% ethanol (v/v, final concentration) onsite, while the biomass in fresh <lb/>influent and effluent (transported to lab within 2 h without fixation) were collected by filtering through 0.2 μm <lb/>pore-sized membranes in lab (100 mL for influent and 1,000 mL for effluent). Then the samples were stored at the <lb/>−20 °C until DNA extraction. <lb/>For the mycobacterial isolation, fresh AS samples from Shatin (ST) and Shekwuhui (SWH) WWTP in Hong <lb/>Kong were transported to the lab within 2 h. The AS was homogenized manually by a glass tissue homogenizer, <lb/>and the resulted suspension was serial diluted with 0.85% NaCl by 10 4 to 10 6 folds. The mycobacterial selective <lb/>agar (Middlebrook 7H-11, BD) adding Middlebrook OADC Enrichment (BD) was applied to selectively cultivate <lb/>Mycobacterium. The plates were incubated in 28 °C for 20 days until no new colonies appeared. Colonies were <lb/>picked according to their shape, size and color and further purified by sequential plate streaking. Their full-length <lb/>16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified by using the universal bacterial primer set of 27F and 1492R and sequenced <lb/>to identify these organisms. Six mycobacterial isolates (one from ST, named ST-F2 and five from SWH named <lb/>SWH-M1 to SWH-M5) were obtained. Therein, four isolates with &gt;2% 16S rRNA inter-strain divergences were <lb/>sequenced to retrieve their draft genomes and were deposited in Marine Culture Collection of China with deposit <lb/>numbers from MCCC 1K02477 to 1K02480. <lb/>DNA extraction, PCR and pyrosequencing of rpoB. The fixed AS samples were washed by 0.85% NaCl <lb/>twice (by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min) and the samples on membrane were detached by vortexing for <lb/>1 min after adding 0.85% NaCl and 1-mm acid-washed glass beads. After collecting the biomass by centrifuga-<lb/>tion, DNA (including AS, biomass on membranes and isolates) was extracted by using the FastDNA SPIN kit for <lb/>Soil as described before 27 . All the extracts were quantified by a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop-1000, Thermo, <lb/>USA) and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. <lb/>To obtain the community-level mycobacterial rpoB amplicon, primers and PCR condition were referred to <lb/>the ref. 25 . The 16 samples were multiplexed by the different 6-nt barcodes adding to the 5′ end of the forward or <lb/>reverse primer 28 . In addition, the adaptor A and B for 454 pyrosequencing were added at the 5′-end of the bar-<lb/>coded forward primers and reverse primer, respectively. The PCR products were pooled at equal mass after purifi-<lb/>cation. The rpoB amplicon pool was sent to Genome Research Center in the University of Hong Kong to perform <lb/>454 pyrosequencing (Titanium platform, Roche, USA). Genomic DNA of the four mycobacterial isolates was sent <lb/>to Beijing Genomic Institute (Shenzhen, China) for Illumina sequencing on the Hiseq2000 platform with inserted <lb/>length of 800 bp and paired-end (PE) reading strategy. <lb/>Construction of the database of mycobacterial rpoB. A mycobacterial rpoB database was con-<lb/>structed by downloading sequences from GenBank in NCBI. The accession numbers of the rpoB references used <lb/>in this study could be found in Table S2. All reference nucleotide sequences were trimmed to 283 bp within <lb/>the primer-free amplicon region. At the time point of analysis, about 180 validated mycobacterial species were <lb/>available (based on the website of List of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature). The database was <lb/>constructed by rpoB sequences from 157 species, whose rpoB sequences fully covering the selected region were <lb/>available. Only four of the 157 references are not from type strains, indicating the excellent taxonomic representa-<lb/>tion of the database. No sequences from subspecies were included. <lb/>Analysis on the rpoB sequences. The raw pyrosequencing reads of the rpoB amplicons were <lb/>de-multiplexed by the barcodes and trimmed by both forward and reverse primers on Mothur platform, which <lb/>was originally invented for 16S rRNA sequences 29 . Quality control of the reads were performed by requiring (1) <lb/>average q-value over 30 within any 20 nt windows; (2) read length over 280 nt and (3) no mismatch in the barcode <lb/>and both primers. All the sequences were then performed BLASTn search against the constructed rpoB database. <lb/>The best-hit outputs satisfying both the similarity over 93% (the cutoff was determined by an evaluation as shown <lb/>in Fig. S1) and alignment length over 280 nt were kept for further analysis and the other sequences were dis-<lb/>carded. According to the evaluation on the inter-species divergence of rpoB, similarity of 95% were set as the crite-<lb/>rion for identification (we performed all-against-all rpoB sequence BLAST and found only about 9% inter-species <lb/>pairs were higher than the cutoff of 95%). The hit was defined as the closest reference species related organism, <lb/></body>

			<body>otherwise the sequences were classified as &apos;unknown Mycobacterium&apos; . Simultaneously, the rpoB sequences across <lb/>all samples were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Mothur platform (using the aligned <lb/>sequences of themselves as the reference for alignment), in order to calculate the taxonomy-independent myco-<lb/>bacterial diversity in each sample. <lb/>Data processing for the genomic and metatranscriptomic data. The four draft genomes have <lb/>been deposited in Whole Genome Shotgun Submissions in Genbank (Accession Number: JMHQ00000000, <lb/>JMHR00000000, JMHS00000000 and JMHT00000000). Mycobacterial gene expression in full-scale AS was inves-<lb/>tigated by revisiting a metatranscritpomic dataset 30 . The details of the genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis <lb/>can be found in the section of Supplementary Methods in the Supplementary Materials. <lb/>Experiments validating biodegradation of cholesterol by mycobacteria. The preparation of the <lb/>medium with that use cholesterol as single carbon source was prepared according referred to ref. 31 . The calcu-<lb/>lated final concentration of cholesterol was 1 mM (in 50 mL Medium 457 of the DSMZ) and the cholesterol was <lb/>mostly in insoluble form with homogenous dispersion in medium. The cultivation is under aerobic condition at <lb/>30 °C in a shaker (200 rpm). Because the mycobacterial isolates usually grow in cell clusters, we determined the <lb/>biomass in 0, 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 d by referring to the DNA content per mL, which were measured by using the <lb/>Qubit device (High Sensitive kits, Invitrogen, USA) after bead-beating lysed cells (FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil, <lb/>MP BIOMEDICALS, USA). The cholesterol concentration during cultivation was determined by referring to <lb/>reference 31 . <lb/>An activated sludge sample and the corresponding influent were collected from Qianpu WWTP (Xiamen, <lb/>China) for the cholesterol enrichment assay. The influent was sterilized by filtering through 0.1 μm pore-size <lb/>membrane. AS was inoculated by 1:9 (v:v) into the influent with adding 0.5 g L −1 cholesterol (final volume 50 mL) <lb/>and cultured by shaking at 200 rpm and 25 °C with a re-inoculation at Day 7. The enrichment sludge samples <lb/>were collected at 0, 7 and 14 d and the DNA was extracted by using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil. The total bac-<lb/>terial and mycobacterial rRNA gene copies were determined by absolute quantitative PCR using primer sets for <lb/>16S rRNA gene (primer set targeting V4 region 32 ), and Mycobacterium (using primer set of MycoARB210 and <lb/>MycoARB585 33 ), respectively. The full-length 16S rRNA gene of SWH-M1 was ligated into the PMD-19T vector <lb/>(Takara, Dalian, China), which was used to create the standard curve for the absolute qPCR of total bacterial or <lb/>mycobacterial 16S rRNA genes. <lb/>Results <lb/>Diversity and taxonomy of mycobacteria in WWTPs. As listed in Table 1, although only a small por-<lb/>tion of reads were filtrated out during the read quality-control step, a large number of sequences (from 36.6% to <lb/>98.7%) were removed due to their low similarity (&lt;93%) with any mycobacterial rpoB reference. By searching <lb/>against the online Genbank NT database, the removed sequences could be rpoB from diverse bacterial lineages, <lb/>especially from other Actinobacteria, indicating the non-specific PCR amplification using the applied primer set <lb/>for the complex environmental samples like AS. Finally, for each sample, from 138 to 5,715 mycobacterial rpoB <lb/>sequences were obtained for the subsequent analysis. <lb/>Table 1 also showed the number of major OTUs (over 1% in all mycobacterial rpoB sequences in the certain <lb/>sample) in each sample, which indicated the mycobacterial diversity.

			<body>indicated that diverse mycobacterial species were present in each WWTP sample, which supported previous <lb/>studies that various mycobacteria could be isolated or culture-independently detected by their 16S rRNA gene in <lb/>one environmental sample 34,35 . For the rpoB sequences assigned as Mycobacterium, those best-hit with similarity <lb/>ranging from 93% to 95% against any reference were determined as &apos;unclassified Mycobacterium&apos; . There were from <lb/>5.8% to 63.0% sequences (17.4% in average) belonging to this catalog (Fig. 1). Apparently, it suggested that a sig-<lb/>nificant proportion of mycobacteria, presented in the WWTPs, were distantly related to those database-covered <lb/>species. <lb/>Figure 2 showed the distribution of classified mycobacterial species (&gt;95% similarity to one reference) in all <lb/>samples. Only hit species that occurred over 2% in at least one sample were displayed. For the 35 species, both <lb/>slowly growing and rapidly growing groups were detected. Referring to the average relative abundance, the top <lb/>five species are M. brumae, M. crocinum, M. sphagni, M. vanbaalenii and M. aromaticivorans, all of which are <lb/>rapidly growing species, originating from natural environments (except for no origination was found for M. <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>sphagni). The frequently investigated M. vanbaalenii was frequently investigated was a multifunctional pollutant <lb/>degrader 36 . However, the other species are poorly characterized so far. <lb/>The clustering analysis among samples suggested that the mycobacteria had a poor biogeographical distri-<lb/>bution (Fig. 2). However, the different sections of the same WWTPs exhibited a similar mycobacterial patterns <lb/>according to the results from the influent, AS and effluent of ST and SWH WWTPs. This result suggested that the <lb/>mycobacterial population in the influent had a significant impact on the subsequent sections, i.e., AS and effluent. <lb/>One possibility is that the majority of Mycobacterium populations in AS are input from the influent and they were <lb/>not strictly selected in the aeration tanks. However, it is interesting that both effluents from ST and SWH showed <lb/>similar composition of the slowly growing species (M. longobardum, M. cookii and M. parascrofulaceum). Thus, <lb/>wastewater treatment may have special selectivity for these slowly growing species. <lb/>Beside of the major populations, potential pathogenic mycobacteria with minor abundance were further ana-<lb/>lyzed by more rigorous criterion of over 98% similarity between query and reference rpoB in the customized <lb/>database. Although no typical slowly-growing pathogenic mycobacteria, such as M. tuberculosis, M. ulcerans, <lb/>etc., were detected at the current sampling depth, we indeed found several opportunistic pathogen species, such <lb/>as M. bacteremicum, M. brisbanense, M. fortuitum, M. frederiksbergense, M. neoaurum, etc. in at least three of <lb/>the 15 samples (Table 2). Therein, M. brisbanense and M. frederiksbergense were detected in six and five samples, <lb/>respectively, indicating relatively wide distribution. Although the relative abundances of the opportunistic patho-<lb/>gen species are usually low, considering the high absolute bacterial cell density in activated sludge, the risk is not <lb/>negligible. For example, in CN-HK-ST sample mycobacteria accounted for 4.0% of total bacteria and M. fortu-<lb/>itum accounted for 0.13% of total mycobacteria (Table S1 and Table 2). This means that M. fortuitum was about <lb/>0.0052% of total bacteria and there were 5.2 × 10 5 cells in the one milliliter of activated sludge (given 10 10 bacterial <lb/>cells per mL). Moreover, it is still hard to conclude that the detected species have direct pathogenic risks since they <lb/>may be non-pathogenic strains. One phenomenon is that M. brisbanense was very high relative abundance in an <lb/>industrial WWTP (31.2% in CN-ARCN) without municipal sewage composition. It is less likely that the detected <lb/>sequences are derived from pathogenic strains. <lb/>Mycobacterial isolates and their genomic information. The phylogenetic tree based on the full length <lb/>of 16S rRNA sequences of the six isolates and reference strains is shown in Fig. S2. Isolates from the SWH WWTP <lb/>showed over 99.5% similarity to references of M. obuense (one isolate), M. mageritense (three isolates) and M. <lb/>goodii (one isolate), respectively. Noticeably, high relative abundance of M. mageritense has been detected in <lb/>the SWH WWTP by rpoB profiling (16.4% of all detected mycobacteria in the influent, Fig. 2). The 16S rRNA <lb/>of isolate ST-F2 from ST WWTP showed 98.9% similarity to its two closest relatives, M. mucogenicum and M. <lb/>phocaicum. By referring to their rpoB sequences extracted from the genomes, SWH-M1, SWH-M3 and SWH-M5 <lb/>were over 99% similar with the references (full length or PCR-targeted region of rpoB according to availability), <lb/>whereas the rpoB of ST-F2 only exhibited 97.5% similarity with AY147171 from M. mucogenicum ATCC49649, <lb/>suggesting its unknown taxonomic position. <lb/>The general information of the four draft genomes is listed in Table S3.

RP1 38 was also detected in SWH-M3 isolate in the exact arrangement with a high similarity of amino acid <lb/>sequences (74.2-88.7%), suggesting the potential morpholine degradation capability of this strain. <lb/>Organisms affiliated with Actinobacteria typically harbor multiple cytochrome P450 gene families that are <lb/>monooxygenases targeting on a great number of organic compounds, especially the persistent organic pollut-<lb/>ants 39 . As expected, we detected a large number of P450 genes and families in each genome (Table 3 and Fig. 3) <lb/>and the no. of P450 gene was apparently related to the genomic size. In the 33 families exhibited in Fig. 3, fourteen <lb/>were found in all the four genomes, while only five were exclusively found in a unique isolate. This result implied <lb/>a significantly shared degradation spectrum among the isolates. Although the majority of detected P450 families <lb/>were not well studied, families related to sterol biosynthesis (CYP51 40 ,), degradation of sterols (CYP125 41 ,) and <lb/>alkanes (CYP153 42 ,) and oxidation of methyl-branched lipids (CYP124 43 ,) were determined in all the isolates. A <lb/>P450 for degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CYP102 44 ,) was only detected in ST-F2 and SWH-M1. <lb/>We also searched the genomes against a recently discovered catabolic pathway of C-19 steroids degradation con-<lb/>taining seven critical genes, i.e., kstD2, kstD3, kshA2, kshB2, hsaA2, hsaC2 and hsaD2 45 .

			<body>Metatranscriptomics hinted mycobacterial function. The above DNA-level information can only <lb/>answer the potential mycobacterial functions, while information at mRNA-level can be more close to their real <lb/>activities. Mycobacterial gene expression in the full-scale municipal WWTPs was profiled by revisiting the first <lb/>published metatranscriptomic dataset of AS 30 . The identified mycobacterial mRNA reads were functionally <lb/>assigned to the hierarchic KEGG metabolic pathways (Fig. S3). Totally, there were 509 mycobacterial mRNA <lb/>reads detected and 206 of them were assigned into the metabolism catalog. In addition to the central pathways <lb/>such as carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolisms, other pathways of metabolisms of terpenoids, polyket-<lb/>ides, xenobiotics and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, were annotated at enzymatic function level. Specially, <lb/>genes exclusively functioning in terpenoids biosynthesis, geraniol and sterol degradation were expressed dur-<lb/>ing sampling. Therein, fifteen mRNA reads classified as the P450 families of CYP102, 108, 123, 124, 125, 132, <lb/>136, 185, 189 and 190 were also detected based on the online annotation of cytochrome P450 homepage and <lb/>NR database validation (Fig. 3). Among them, CYP125 had been reported as cholesterol degrading enzyme in <lb/>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and M. tuberculosis 41,46 . <lb/>Experimental validation of cholesterol degradation. The genomic and metatranscriptomic results <lb/>suggested that one of mycobacterial functions may be degradation of steroids, which are typically abundant in <lb/>municipal sewage. Experimental results indicated that the single carbon source of cholesterol could be degraded <lb/>by all isolates with the increase of their biomass (Fig. 4A,B), confirming that at least some mycobacteria in AS <lb/>could degrade the typical sterols in sewage. On the other hand, after enrichment by adding cholesterol into the <lb/>filtrated influent, the relative abundance the 16S rRNA gene copies of mycobacteria to total bacteria in the AS <lb/>increased from 0.85% to 4.04% and 3.11% (4.7 and 3.7 fold) on the seventh day and the fourteenth day, respec-<lb/>tively (Fig. 4C). Together with the metatranscriptomic results, these findings validated that Mycobacterium in AS <lb/>play a significant role in degradation of the cholesterol in the municipal sewage. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Mycobacterium are moderately abundant genus that can be up to 4% of total bacteria 7 . It was thought to be <lb/>foaming bacteria causing adverse operational problems during sewage treatment 5,47 . For the Shatin WWTP, our <lb/>previous study also found that Mycobacterium were not significantly enriched in the foam compared with the AS <lb/>phase 48 . According to a five-year monthly monitoring of the bacterial community in Shatin WWTPs, abundances <lb/>of Mycobacterium were quite stable 49 . By using the five-year monitoring data, the mycobacterial abundances in AS <lb/>related with the operational parameters were analyzed. As shown in Fig. S4 (canonical correspondence analysis <lb/>for the variation of total mycobacteria and 6 subgroups and parameters), the abundance of total mycobacteria <lb/>hardly interacted with any presented physiochemical factors in the influent. Such observation, consistent with <lb/>the high frequency of Mycobacterium in global WWTPs 7 , indicated that Mycobacterium stably occupied certain <lb/>nutritional niche in the WWTPs. However, Fig. S4 also showed that factors such as BOD, temperature, SRT, etc., <lb/>could affect the variation of different subgroups, which may include those potential pathogenic Mycobacterium <lb/>species as detected in this study. Noticeably, Species of atypical Mycobacterium had shown resistance to chlo-<lb/>rination 50 , which is a common processing to minimizing hygienic impacts of AS treatment. In order to reduce <lb/>pathogenic risk, as suggested by our results that multiple opportunistic mycobacterial pathogens can be detected <lb/>in WWTPs, it is important to understand the pathogenicity of the strains and the effect of operational parameters <lb/>on those pathogenic mycobacterial species in the future studies. <lb/>As the first detailed investigation on mycobacterial diversity and functions in AS for sewage treatment, we <lb/>found that nearly all abundant mycobacterial populations identified in the present study, such as M. brumae, <lb/>M. crocinum, M. sphagni, M. aromaticivorans and the isolates, were species without extensive studies on their <lb/>eco-physiology, which raises further interests to study their physiology in wastewater treatment. Interestingly, <lb/>three recently established species isolated from Hawaiian soils, i.e., M. crocinum, M. aromaticivorans, M. rufum, <lb/>co-occurred on the list of species 51 , suggesting that some Mycobacterium species in WWTPs may be indigenous <lb/>species of soil. <lb/>So far, a great number of cytochrome P450 family genes and PAHs degradation capabilities have been found in <lb/>environmental Mycobacterium isolates 52,53 . However, very few species were isolated from the municipal or indus-<lb/>trial wastewater treatment plants. Our investigation indicated that mycobacteria populations in AS are highly <lb/>diverse and intriguingly novel according to their rpoB sequences. More efforts should be made to obtain more <lb/>isolates from the wastewater treatment systems. Meanwhile, the opportunistic mycobacterial pathogens detected <lb/>suggested the possible health risk of mycobacteria in WWTPs although the chance may not be high as showed by <lb/>our results. It raised concerns to further study the viability of these organisms (i.e., live or dead) in effluent and <lb/>the efficiency of disinfection methods to remove them. <lb/>A report has shown that most Mycobacterium cells in the influent were removed after decantation, implying <lb/>that these organisms linked with large particles as determined by their hydrophobic nature 54 . Sterols, mostly cho-<lb/>lesterol, are the significant sewage components that are relatively resistant to biological degradation 55 Their high <lb/>apolarity determines their low solubility and association with large particles, perhaps the other insoluble fecal <lb/>materials. Thus, our results also support that at least some mycobacteria in AS are particle-associated and related <lb/>to the influent populations (Fig. 1B). Moreover, it is more important that the metatranscriptomic data and the test <lb/>of cell growth on cholesterol indicated that mycobacteria played a role in sterols degradation in WWTPs. Thus, <lb/>for the first time, this study proposes the functional roles of Mycobacterium as degraders of sterols in biological <lb/>treatment of municipal wastewater. Furthermore, we also confirmed that all the four isolates could grow readily <lb/>on filtrated particle-free sewage influent (data not shown), indicating that they can easily degrade soluble organ-<lb/>ics in sewage. Therefore, besides the function of sterol degradation proposed in the present study, mycobacterial <lb/>species may also have roles in biodegradation of other pollutant. <lb/></body>

			<body>In summary, the study presents the first detailed investigation on mycobacterial diversity and functions in the <lb/>activated sludge for sewage treatment. Nearly all abundant mycobacterial populations were so far poorly char-<lb/>acterized species such as M. brumae, M. crocinum, M. sphagni, etc. Mycobacterial function of sterol degradation <lb/>that was proposed by genomic and metatranscriptomic data, as well as the experimental validation of isolates. <lb/>Meanwhile, although a few opportunistic pathogens like M. brisbanense and M. frederiksbergense were detected, <lb/>a comprehensive study based on more AS samples will provide more reliable information about the existence and <lb/>distribution of pathogenic mycobacteria in wastewater treatment systems. <lb/></body>
