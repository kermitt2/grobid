People experiencing incarceration are at high risk for TB, <lb/>however, how COVID-19-related disruptions have impacted incarcerated populations with TB is unknown. <lb/>Methods Using Peruvian National TB Program data from Jan 2018 to Dec 2021, an interrupted time series of drug-<lb/>susceptible (DS) TB case notifications pre-and during COVID-19 was conducted (cut-off date: COVID-19 emergency <lb/>declaration in Peru, 16 March 2020). The effect of TB care occurring pre-vs. during COVID-19 on TB treatment <lb/>success in the incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations was explored using logistic regression. <lb/>Findings DS-TB cases notified in prisons from Jan 2018 to Dec 2021 (n = 10,134) represented 10% of all cases notified in <lb/>the country (n = 101,507). In the first week of COVID-19, DS-TB case notifications dropped by 61.2% (95% CI: <lb/>59.9-62.7%) in the non-incarcerated population and 17.7% (95% CI: 17.5-17.9%) among the incarcerated population. <lb/>TB treatment success was significantly lower in people receiving TB care entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic vs. <lb/>before COVID-19 in the non-incarcerated population (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78-0.85), but not statistically significantly <lb/>lower in the incarcerated population (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.76-1.01). Incarceration status was not found to modify the <lb/>effect of COVID-19 period on TB treatment outcomes (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.92-1.25), although treatment success was <lb/>higher in the incarcerated population (OR [incarcerated vs. not incarcerated, pre-COVID]: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.39-1.67). <lb/>Interpretation Both incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations experienced a large drop in DS-TB case <lb/>notifications (although higher in the non-incarcerated population). Lower TB treatment success among those <lb/>receiving care during COVID-19 indicates significant TB service disruptions in the overall population. The finding <lb/>that incarceration at time of diagnosis was associated with treatment success is plausible in Peru given increased <lb/>screening and stricter treatment monitoring in prisons. <lb/>Funding Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Funding Reference Number: 179418) . <lb/>Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The COVID-19 pandemic has set back progress on <lb/>ending TB globally, with the World Health Organisation <lb/>(WHO) reporting increases in TB incidence and <lb/>mortality in recent years. 1-3 The COVID-19 pandemic <lb/>has severely disrupted TB control in Peru, 4,5 which suf-<lb/>fered the 13th largest drop in TB case notifications from <lb/>2019 to 2020 of all countries worldwide. 3 In light of <lb/>Research in context <lb/>Evidence before this study <lb/>An initial literature search on TB treatment outcomes in <lb/>prisons, using the Embase and Medline databases (via Ovid) <lb/>was conducted in September 2022, and updated in August <lb/>2023, including studies published from the year 2000 to the <lb/>search date (August 2023 for the updated search), and used <lb/>the search terms (prison* OR jail OR incarcerat* OR detain* <lb/>OR detention OR deprived of liberty) AND (tuberculosis) AND <lb/>(treatment outcome* OR treatment completion OR <lb/>treatment success). This search identified 211 studies, of <lb/>which 27 compared TB outcomes among incarcerated vs. <lb/>non-incarcerated populations. These studies were conducted <lb/>in the USA (n = 4), Brazil (n = 3), Iran (n = 3), the Netherlands <lb/>(n = 2), Georgia (n = 2), Malawi, Spain, Portugal, Estonia, <lb/>Latvia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Russia, Kazakhstan, <lb/>and Australia (n = 1 in each country), or across multiple <lb/>countries (n = 2). Studies reported heterogeneous findings <lb/>regarding treatment success, with treatment success being <lb/>lower in incarcerated populations in some settings due to risk <lb/>factors and barriers to care being prevalent in the carceral <lb/>setting, whilst in other settings, more favourable treatment <lb/>outcomes have been observed among people in prisons due <lb/>to stricter treatment monitoring and more frequent <lb/>screening. This highlights that TB outcomes in prisons are <lb/>context-dependent. In addition, although it is also known <lb/>that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted TB <lb/>programs globally, none of these studies evaluated the impact <lb/>of COVID-19 on TB notifications and treatment outcomes in <lb/>incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations. Lastly, <lb/>restricting the above search to studies conducted in Peru, but <lb/>removing the search terms related to treatment outcomes (to <lb/>return any studies on TB in prisons in Peru, regardless of <lb/>study objective) identified one study including participants <lb/>from Peru and four other countries that found history of <lb/>incarceration to be associated with loss to follow-up during <lb/>TB treatment. However, results were not stratified by country <lb/>and Peru-specific estimates are therefore not available. Two <lb/>further studies conducted in Peru investigated the role of <lb/>prisons in TB transmission to the general community, and <lb/>two others surveyed detainees to assess the prevalence of TB <lb/>in prisons in Peru, finding a high prevalence, however, these <lb/>estimates are limited by reliance on self-reported TB <lb/>diagnoses. This highlights that TB in prisons in Peru remains <lb/>under-studied, despite overcrowding in prisons in the country <lb/>being an urgent and growing concern for infectious disease <lb/>prevention. <lb/>Added value of this study <lb/>This national-level study of DS-TB case notifications and <lb/>treatment outcomes in the incarcerated and non-incarcerated <lb/>populations of Peru contributes to our understanding of <lb/>disruptions to TB services during the pandemic in these <lb/>populations. We found extremely high DS-TB notification <lb/>rates in prisons in Peru, highlighting incarcerated populations <lb/>as a key population for TB elimination in Peru. In addition, we <lb/>found a higher drop in case notifications in the non-<lb/>incarcerated population than in the incarcerated population in <lb/>the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic. TB treatment <lb/>outcomes were also affected by COVID-19-related disruptions, <lb/>with TB treatment success in the non-incarcerated population <lb/>being significantly lower among those receiving all of their TB <lb/>care during the pandemic (compared to before the <lb/>pandemic). Our finding that the likelihood of treatment <lb/>success was higher among people receiving their TB diagnosis <lb/>in prison (possibly due to increased screening and treatment <lb/>monitoring in prisons in Peru) contributes to existing <lb/>knowledge on TB treatment outcomes in prisons, as findings <lb/>from studies in other countries have been heterogeneous, <lb/>underlining the importance of country-specific studies, given <lb/>that carceral settings vary across countries. Therefore, this <lb/>study adds to existing literature on TB in incarcerated <lb/>populations, particularly in Peru, where TB in prisons is under-<lb/>studied. <lb/>Implications of all the available evidence <lb/>We highlight that the burden of TB in prisons in Peru is <lb/>extremely high compared to the general population in the <lb/>country. The drop in case notifications during COVID-19 in <lb/>both the incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations <lb/>suggests a high number of missed cases, potentially hindering <lb/>early treatment initiation and favourable outcomes among <lb/>patients. The finding that TB treatment success was <lb/>significantly lower in those receiving TB care during COVID-19 <lb/>(in the non-incarcerated population) highlights significant <lb/>setbacks in TB care incurred during the pandemic. The <lb/>resilience of TB services in the carceral setting to external <lb/>disruptions such as those seen during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic, in combination with the high burden of TB in this <lb/>population, highlights prisons as unique settings in which TB <lb/>prevention and treatment is feasible yet urgent, making clear <lb/>that prisons should be key priorities for TB elimination efforts. <lb/>Further studies on TB among people in prison are needed, <lb/>particularly those using a dynamic indicator of incarceration <lb/>status (which was not possible in this study). <lb/></body>

			<body>these disruptions, it is urgent to focus TB elimination <lb/>efforts on key populations, such as people experiencing <lb/>incarceration, who are at particularly high risk for TB. <lb/>We therefore evaluate TB case notifications and treat-<lb/>ment outcomes among the incarcerated and non-<lb/>incarcerated populations in Peru, before compared to <lb/>during the COVID-19 pandemic. <lb/>Studies in a variety of countries report an <lb/>extremely high prevalence and incidence of TB in <lb/>incarcerated populations. 6-12 Prisons in South America, <lb/>however, have been found to have a particularly <lb/>high burden of TB, with a systematic review esti-<lb/>mating a pooled TB prevalence of 1680 cases/ <lb/>100,000 persons (95% CI: 830-2970) in the region. 12 <lb/>In Peru, results of a 2016 survey of detainees found <lb/>a prevalence of 2510 cases/100,000 persons of self-<lb/>reported TB diagnosis (detainees reported having <lb/>been diagnosed by a healthcare provider) during <lb/>incarceration. 13 <lb/>Findings regarding TB treatment outcomes in <lb/>prisons in previous studies are variable. Barriers to <lb/>successful TB treatment may be exacerbated in the <lb/>prison setting by high rates of tobacco, drug and <lb/>alcohol use, 14 and some studies report low proportions <lb/>of treatment success. 15,16 Other studies, however, have <lb/>found higher treatment success among people living <lb/>in prisons than among those not incarcerated, <lb/>including a large study in Brazil (n = 17,776 incar-<lb/>cerated, n = 160,728 non-incarcerated) that found <lb/>higher treatment success in the incarcerated popula-<lb/>tion (82.2% vs. 75.1%, p &lt; 0.0001) due to more <lb/>widespread implementation of DOTs in the prison <lb/>setting. 17 <lb/>Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in <lb/>places of detention, COVID-19 cases and deaths are <lb/>much higher in prisons compared to the general <lb/>population. 18-20 Prison settings also experienced larger <lb/>COVID-19-related disruptions as prisons were de-<lb/>prioritized in the pandemic response (including in <lb/>COVID-19 vaccine roll-out). 21,22 In addition, limited <lb/>health resources in prisons have been diverted towards <lb/>the pandemic response, 23,24 resulting in restrictions of <lb/>detainees&apos; medical appointments outside of prison, long <lb/>delays in care pathways, 23 and, in some cases, the limi-<lb/>tation of prison health services to emergency-only <lb/>levels. 22 The pandemic also aggravated already-dire <lb/>staff shortages in prisons, 22 and although some set-<lb/>tings enacted decarceration measures to alleviate pres-<lb/>sure on prison health systems, these were <lb/>temporary. 21,25-27 <lb/>There are currently no studies on TB treatment <lb/>outcomes in incarcerated and non-incarcerated pop-<lb/>ulations in Peru. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic <lb/>has now presented further challenges for TB care in <lb/>both the general population and in prisons. Although <lb/>TB control globally has been severely disrupted by <lb/>COVID-19, 1 specific high-risk settings, such as prisons, <lb/>have not been evaluated despite widespread reports of <lb/>disrupted health services in prisons. 10,11 This study <lb/>therefore aimed to describe DS-TB case notifications in <lb/>the overall and incarcerated population in each <lb/>department (largest administrative division) of Peru, <lb/>assess trends in weekly national DS-TB case notifica-<lb/>tions prior to vs. during COVID-19, and identify pre-<lb/>dictors of treatment success (treatment completion or <lb/>cure) in incarcerated and non-incarcerated people in <lb/>Peru, prior to vs. during the COVID-19 pandemic. To <lb/>assess trends in the DS-TB case notifications prior to <lb/>and during the pandemic, an interrupted time series <lb/>(ITS) approach is used. This allows extrapolation of the <lb/>pre-COVID-19 trend in the during-COVID-19 period <lb/>(counterfactual) and comparison of this to the observed <lb/>during-COVID-19 trend. 28 <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study setting and context <lb/>COVID-19 in Peru <lb/>For context on disruptions during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic in Peru, COVID-19 case surges as well as <lb/>the associated restrictions (closures of schools, work-<lb/>places, transport, etc.) are shown in Fig. 1 (COVID-19 <lb/>cases from the WHO COVID-19 database, 29 and <lb/>COVID-19 measures/policies from the Oxford COVID-<lb/>19 Government Response Tracker 30 ). <lb/>Incarceration in Peru <lb/>As of September 2023, over 93,000 people are living <lb/>in prisons in Peru, 31 (incarceration rate: 273/100,000 <lb/>people 32 ). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows trends in the <lb/>incarcerated population size over the study period <lb/>(2018-2021). On average, prisons in the country are <lb/>at 220% capacity, 31 creating aforementioned risks for <lb/>increased transmission of TB, COVID-19, and other <lb/>infectious diseases. 33 In response to the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic, approximately 7,900 detainees have <lb/>been released since 2020 under the decriminalization <lb/>laws enacted to reduce the incarcerated population. 34 <lb/>TB management in prisons in Peru <lb/>The following information on TB management in <lb/>prisons in Peru is based on observations and discus-<lb/>sions with penitentiary health staff during visits (re-<lb/>ported here by the author and collaborators) to two large <lb/>prison facilities in Peru. It should therefore be noted <lb/>that specifics pertaining to the availability of TB services <lb/>may vary by facility, particularly in smaller or more <lb/>remote prisons. <lb/>Depending on their size, prison establishments in <lb/>Peru have dedicated TB care facilities and staff. <lb/>Detainees receive a physical health evaluation and a <lb/>chest X-ray at entry, and those with abnormal chest X-<lb/>ray findings undergo sputum microscopy.

			<body>Fund, are available in 3 of the country&apos;s 68 prisons. <lb/>Large prisons may have laboratories for sputum mi-<lb/>croscopy on-site, although samples are sent to external <lb/>reference laboratories for culture and drug-<lb/>susceptibility testing. <lb/>Detained persons diagnosed with TB stay in cell <lb/>blocks separate from healthy detainees (at least until <lb/>smear negative) and receive additional food (4 meals per <lb/>day). DOT is provided either directly in the cells, or at a <lb/>TB treatment area within the prison. Treatment for <lb/>extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is centralised at one <lb/>specific prison in the country. If a detainee is released <lb/>during TB treatment, they are referred to their local <lb/>primary care centre for continuation of treatment, <lb/>although in practice ensuring continuity of care in this <lb/>context is difficult. Although reduced staff and the <lb/>attribution of respiratory symptoms to COVID-19 <lb/>complicated TB care in prisons during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic (likely reducing case detection), prison clinic <lb/>hours, DOTS and treatment monitoring continued as <lb/>normal, according to discussions with penitentiary <lb/>health staff. <lb/>Study population <lb/>We included all adults (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with <lb/>drug-susceptible TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) <lb/>from 1 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2021 (refer to section below <lb/>for analysis-specific timeframes within this period) and <lb/>reported in the Peruvian national TB program database, <lb/>Sistema de Información Gerencial de Tuberculosis <lb/>(SIGTB). 35 <lb/>Data source <lb/>SIGTB 35 includes information on all notified TB cases in <lb/>Peru, including TB diagnoses within the prison system, <lb/>as well as basic demographic and clinical information <lb/>(age, sex, HIV status, diabetes status, type of TB (pul-<lb/>monary/extra-pulmonary), drug-resistance status, treat-<lb/>ment outcome). <lb/>For the purpose of this study, TB among incarcerated <lb/>individuals is defined as cases diagnosed during incar-<lb/>ceration, with those receiving a TB diagnosis after <lb/>release from a prior incarceration not being included in <lb/>this category. This is because incarceration status is only <lb/>available in SIGTB for those receiving a TB diagnosis <lb/>during incarceration (prior incarceration status and <lb/>length of incarceration is not captured). <lb/>Timeframes and COVID-19 period definitions <lb/>Definitions of pre-vs. during COVID-19 periods for each <lb/>analysis are described below. <lb/>Department-level DS-TB case notifications in the incarcerated <lb/>&amp; non-incarcerated populations pre-&amp; during COVID-19 <lb/>Case notifications in the one-year timeframe prior to <lb/>COVID-19 (based on date of diagnosis as recorded in <lb/>the NTP database) were compared to notifications in the <lb/>first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis <lb/>therefore includes those diagnosed between 15 March <lb/>2019 and 15 March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and those <lb/>diagnosed between 16 March 2020 and 16 March 2021 <lb/>(during COVID-19). <lb/>Interrupted time series analysis of DS-TB case notifications <lb/>pre-&amp; during COVID-19 <lb/>This analysis includes all cases notified between 1 Jan <lb/>2018 and 31 Dec 2021. As pandemic restrictions and the <lb/>declaration of a national state of emergency came into <lb/>effect in Peru on 16 March 2020, 36 the week of 16 March <lb/>2020 is defined as the first week of COVID-19 in the ITS <lb/>analysis. <lb/>DS-TB treatment outcomes in the incarcerated &amp; non-<lb/>incarcerated populations pre-&amp; during COVID-19 <lb/>This analysis includes those diagnosed between 1 Jan <lb/>2018 and 16 Mar 2021. As this analysis assesses TB <lb/>treatment outcomes rather than case notifications, <lb/>treatment time is taken into account in the categoriza-<lb/>tion of COVID-19 periods into three categories: TB care <lb/>occurring pre-COVID-19, partially during COVID-19, <lb/>Fig. 1: Weekly new COVID-19 cases reported in Peru, 29 and COVID-19-<lb/>related restrictions coinciding with the study period (Jan 2020-Dec <lb/>2021). 30 COVID-19 cases are from the WHO COVID-19 database. 29 <lb/>COVID-19 measures/policies are from the Oxford COVID-19 Govern-<lb/>ment Response Tracker. 30 <lb/></body>

			<body>and fully during COVID-19. For example, those on a 6-<lb/>month standard regimen for DS-TB were defined as <lb/>having received TB care prior to COVID-19 if they were <lb/>diagnosed between 1 Jan 2018 and 15 Sep 2019, <lb/>meaning they would have been expected to complete <lb/>their 6-month treatment prior to the start of COVID-19 <lb/>restrictions on 16 Mar 2020. Similarly, those on a 6-<lb/>month regimen diagnosed between 16 Sep 2019 and <lb/>15 Mar 2020 were defined as having received their TB <lb/>care partially during COVID-19, and those diagnosed 16 <lb/>Mar 2020 to 16 Mar 2021 were defined as receiving their <lb/>TB care fully during COVID-19. For detail on COVID-19 <lb/>period definitions adapted to those receiving longer <lb/>regimens (9-month and 12-month), 37 please refer to <lb/>Table 1. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>R (version 4.1.2) was used for all statistical analyses. 38 <lb/>Department-level DS-TB case notifications in the incarcerated <lb/>&amp; non-incarcerated populations pre-&amp; during COVID-19 <lb/>Departments are the largest administrative division of <lb/>Peru (followed by provinces and districts), and there are <lb/>25 departments in the country in total (24 plus the <lb/>constitutional province of Callao). 39 TB case notifications <lb/>in the incarcerated population were compared with the <lb/>general population in each department by calculating <lb/>incidence rate ratios (IRR) (Supplementary Section 1). 12 <lb/>Department-level IRRs are also presented for the pre-<lb/>COVID-19 time period (diagnoses between 15 March <lb/>2019 and 15 March 2020) and during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic (diagnoses between 16 March 2020 and 16 <lb/>March 2021). <lb/>Interrupted time series analysis of DS-TB case notifications <lb/>pre-&amp; during COVID-19 <lb/>An interrupted time series was conducted for weekly <lb/>DS-TB case notifications in SIGTB from 1 Jan 2018 to <lb/>31 Dec 2021 (209 weeks in total). The start of the <lb/>COVID-19 pandemic was considered the date of the <lb/>declaration of the national emergency due to COVID-19, <lb/>16 Mar 2020 (week 116 of 209). As this was a Monday, <lb/>weeks in the time series were defined as starting on <lb/>Mondays. <lb/>To model weekly case counts, a negative binomial <lb/>model was used to account for overdispersion of the <lb/>data. We present observed case notifications and coun-<lb/>terfactual trends expected in the absence of the COVID-<lb/>19 pandemic. 40 Three separate models were fit, for case <lb/>notifications among 1) the total population of Peru 2) <lb/>the non-incarcerated population, and 3) the incarcerated <lb/>population. <lb/>Based on the observed temporal trend in case noti-<lb/>fication in the total population, three time periods were <lb/>defined: Phase 1, the pre-COVID-19 phase (weeks <lb/>1-115, i.e., 1 Jan 2018 to 15 Mar 2020), phase 2-the <lb/>recovery phase (weeks 116-151, i.e., 16 Mar 2020 to 22 <lb/>Nov 2020), and phase 3-the post-recovery phase (weeks <lb/>152-209, i.e., 23 Nov 2020 to 31 Dec 2021). In phase 2, <lb/>cases increased linearly after the initial drop due to <lb/>COVID-19, and in phase 3 the temporal trend began to <lb/>resemble phase 1. Seasonality trends were modelled <lb/>using harmonic terms. In the simplest case, the same <lb/>harmonic term was used for the duration of the time <lb/>series. However, if the seasonality pattern changed <lb/>across phases, distinct harmonic terms were used for <lb/>each phase. Dichotomous indicators were used to <lb/>modify the intercept, slope, and harmonic terms for the <lb/>respective phases (Supplementary Figs. S2-S4). <lb/>All models included the log of the population size as <lb/>an offset term, to account for fluctuations in the source <lb/>population. In particular, notable changes in the incar-<lb/>cerated population occurred due to decarceration efforts <lb/>during the COVID-19 pandemic (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. S1). Estimates of the total population size were <lb/>based on annual population projections from the Peru-<lb/>vian census, 41 the population size for those incarcerated <lb/>was based on monthly counts of the incarcerated pop-<lb/>ulation from Peru&apos;s penitentiary institute database, 42 <lb/>and the non-incarcerated population size was based on <lb/>annual population estimates from the national census, <lb/>minus the average annual incarcerated population. <lb/>Model equations are shown in the Supplementary <lb/>Equations S1-S3. <lb/>Counterfactual values for expected case notifications <lb/>in the absence of COVID-19 were estimated using the <lb/>Phase 1 (pre-COVID-19) model parameters.

Relevant cova-<lb/>riates adjusted for included sex, age, HIV status, dia-<lb/>betes status, smoking, extrapulmonary vs. pulmonary <lb/>TB, new vs. relapse case, TB treatment adherence, and <lb/>health insurance type. The non-linear relationship <lb/>between age and likelihood of treatment success was <lb/>modelled flexibly using penalised splines.

There are <lb/>various categories of health insurance in Peru; Seguro <lb/>Integral de Salud (SIS), Seguro Social de Salud (EsSa-<lb/>lud), and private insurance. 4 SIS is Peru&apos;s free public <lb/>health insurance, serving the lower-income population, <lb/>while EsSalud is insurance provided to workers via their <lb/>employer (note: individuals employed in the police or <lb/>armed forces have separate health insurance financed by <lb/>the Ministry of Defence. 4 This is included in the <lb/>worker&apos;s insurance category for the purpose of our <lb/>analysis). Lastly, for additional benefits, private insur-<lb/>ance can also be obtained by those able to pay higher <lb/>premiums. Health insurance type is therefore expected <lb/>to be a relevant (although imperfect) proxy for socio-<lb/>economic status. <lb/>As only the number of doses at exit (end of follow-up, <lb/>completion, or death, etc) were available in the national <lb/>TB program database, adherence is estimated based on <lb/>the number of doses at exit, vs. total doses expected for <lb/>the individual&apos;s treatment regimen and their time on <lb/>treatment before exit. Implausibly high values for doses <lb/>at exit were recoded as missing. <lb/>TB treatment success was defined as either cure or <lb/>treatment completion. Treatment drop-out, treatment <lb/>failure, the development of drug-resistant TB, or death <lb/>were classified as unsuccessful treatment outcomes. <lb/>The development of drug-resistance or other reasons for <lb/>permanent treatment suspensions or changes were also <lb/>classified as failures of first-line treatment, as per <lb/>updated WHO treatment outcome definitions. 43 <lb/>Covariates with missing data included diabetes (8.2% <lb/>missing), HIV (7.3% missing), adherence (2.6% <lb/>missing), health insurance type (0.2% missing), smok-<lb/>ing (0.2% missing), site (pulmonary/extrapulmonary) of <lb/>TB (0.01% missing), and COVID-19 period (0.004% <lb/>missing-due to missingness of treatment regimen, pre/ <lb/>during COVID-19 TB treatment was not assigned in <lb/>these cases, given this was defined based on expected <lb/>treatment length). Missing data on covariates were <lb/>imputed by multiple imputation by chained equations <lb/>(MICE) (using the &apos;mice&apos; package in R), 44 and the <lb/>imputed data used in final analyses. Individuals with <lb/>missing outcome data (2.9%) were excluded from ana-<lb/>lyses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess <lb/>robustness of results, including the effect on model <lb/>estimates of the use of MICE for imputation of missing <lb/>covariate data compared to complete case analysis, and <lb/>classifying those with missing outcome data as having <lb/>unsuccessful outcomes. <lb/>Power calculation <lb/>Our sample size was fixed by design, as it included all <lb/>adult TB notifications in Peru in the study period. <lb/>Research ethics <lb/>Ethics approval was obtained by McGill University <lb/>(McGill IRB: A09-M51-21A) and Universidad Peruana <lb/>Cayetano Heredia (UPCH IRB SIDISI: 209660). <lb/>Approval to use SIGTB data was granted by the Peruvian <lb/>National TB program.

			<body>(analysis-specific timeframes described in Methods). <lb/>Between 15 Mar 2019 and 16 Mar 2021, 48,352 adult <lb/>DS-TB cases were notified in Peru, of which 4776 (9.9%) <lb/>were incarcerated at the time of their TB diagnosis. <lb/>Department-level case notifications per 100,000 people <lb/>are shown in Fig. 2, by incarceration status and COVID-<lb/>19 period, and including approximate locations of the <lb/>country&apos;s largest prisons. Exact notification rates by <lb/>department, and for the total population of Peru, are <lb/>shown in Supplementary Table S1. The country-level <lb/>notification rates (for all of Peru) in the total popula-<lb/>tion (incarcerated and non-incarcerated) were 89 DS-TB <lb/>cases per 100,000 people in the year prior to COVID-19 <lb/>and 60 DS-TB cases per 100,000 in the first year of the <lb/>pandemic. In the non-incarcerated population, the rates <lb/>were 81 and 54 DS-TB cases per 100,000 people in the <lb/>pre-vs. during COVID-19 periods, respectively. In <lb/>prisons in Peru, notification rates were extremely high, <lb/>with 2894 DS-TB cases per 100,000 people notified in <lb/>the year prior to COVID-19, and 2245 cases per 100,000 <lb/>people in the first year of COVID-19. <lb/>By department, notification rates in the overall pop-<lb/>ulation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic ranged from <lb/>15 cases per 100,000 people (in Cajamarca) to 182 per <lb/>100,000 people (in Ucayali) and ranged from 9 per <lb/>100,000 (in Huancavelica) to 119 per 100,000 people (in <lb/>Ucayali) in the first year of the pandemic. In the incar-<lb/>cerated population, notifications rates by department <lb/>Fig. 2: Title: Drug-susceptible tuberculosis case notifications in the incarcerated vs. non-incarcerated population, per 100,000 people, Pre-and <lb/>during COVID-19, in Peru, by department (March 2019 to March 2021).

It should <lb/>be noted that IRRs here represent notifications in <lb/>prisons in each department divided by overall notifica-<lb/>tions in the department, and notifications do not <lb/>necessarily represent true incidence given under-<lb/>diagnosis and under-notification of incident TB cases. <lb/>In addition, it should be noted that changes in IRRs can <lb/>reflect changes in both the numerator and denominator. <lb/>Exact IRRs by department are listed in Supplementary <lb/>Table S1. IRRs between prisons and the total popula-<lb/>tion are high, echoing previous findings from South <lb/>America. 12 The IRR between the incarcerated and total <lb/>population of Peru was 32.37 in the year prior to <lb/>COVID-19, and 37.32 in the first year of COVID-19. <lb/>Overall, IRRs during COVID-19 increased compared <lb/>to pre-COVID-19 IRRs, due to the larger drop in noti-<lb/>fications in the general population compared to in the <lb/>incarcerated population (covered in more detail in the <lb/>time series analysis). <lb/>Interrupted time series analysis of DS-TB case <lb/>notifications pre-and during COVID-19 <lb/>From 1 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2021, 101,507 adult DS-TB <lb/>cases were notified in the national TB program data-<lb/>base, of which 10,134 (10.0%) were notified in in-<lb/>dividuals who were incarcerated at the time of their TB <lb/>diagnosis. Observed weekly case notifications and the <lb/>counterfactual trend of notifications expected in the <lb/>absence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the total, non-<lb/>incarcerated, and incarcerated populations are shown <lb/>in Fig. 4. Case notifications as rates per 100,000 popu-<lb/>lation in the incarcerated and non-incarcerated pop-<lb/>ulations are provided in Supplementary Fig. S4. <lb/>Case notifications among the total Peruvian popula-<lb/>tion (Fig. 4a) dropped sharply in the first week of the <lb/>enactment of COVID-19-related restrictions in Peru <lb/>(week 116) compared to the counterfactual expected <lb/>number of cases in the same week, with 234 predicted <lb/>cases (95% CI: 215-253) (in terms of rates, 0.72 cases <lb/>per 100,000 people, 95% CI: 0.66-0.78) in the observed <lb/>scenario (start of COVID-19) compared to 559 cases <lb/>Fig. 3: Drug-susceptible tuberculosis incidence rate ratio between the incarcerated and total population pre-and during COVID-19* in Peru, by <lb/>department (March 2019-March 2021).

This represents a 58.1% drop in cases (95% <lb/>CI: 56.7-59.7) in the observed vs. counterfactual sce-<lb/>narios (Table 2). <lb/>Upon stratifying non-incarcerated and incarcerated <lb/>populations, it becomes clear that the overall drop in <lb/>case notifications was greater among the non-<lb/>incarcerated population. Among the non-incarcerated <lb/>population (Figs. 4b), 196 cases (95% CI: 180-212) <lb/>were predicted in week 116 under the observed sce-<lb/>nario, vs. 506 cases (95% CI: 484-528) expected in the <lb/>absence of COVID-19, suggesting a 61.2% (95% CI: <lb/>59.9-62.7%) drop in notifications in the first week of the <lb/>pandemic. Among the incarcerated population (Fig. 4c), <lb/>however, 42 cases (95% CI: 37-47) were expected in <lb/>week 116 under the observed scenario, vs. 51 cases (95% <lb/>CI: 45-57) in the absence of COVID-19, representing a <lb/>17.7% (95% CI: 17.5-17.9%) drop. <lb/>Following the drop in case notifications in the first <lb/>week of COVID-19, case notifications gradually recov-<lb/>ered, with the notification gap relative to the counter-<lb/>factual scenario generally decreasing throughout 2020. <lb/>To further describe differences in notification rates <lb/>relative to the counterfactual scenario throughout the <lb/>pandemic, Supplementary Table S3 shows % differ-<lb/>ences in observed vs. counterfactual DS-TB notification <lb/>rates at 3-month time points. In addition, the linear <lb/>components of the trends in the pre-COVID-19 and <lb/>during COVID-19 phases are described in <lb/>Supplementary Table S2. <lb/>DS-TB treatment outcomes in the incarcerated and <lb/>non-incarcerated populations pre-and during <lb/>COVID-19 <lb/>Treatment outcomes were assessed among 80,535 <lb/>adults with DS-TB notified between 1 Jan 2018 and 16 <lb/>Mar 2021. Of 83,039 cases notified in this period, <lb/>n = 140 (0.2%) were excluded due to treatment sus-<lb/>pension after an erroneous diagnosis of TB, and <lb/>n = 2364 (2.9%) were excluded due to missing treatment <lb/>outcome. The incarcerated population had a lower pro-<lb/>portion of missing outcome data than the non-<lb/>incarcerated population (0.6% vs. 3.1%, respectively) <lb/>(Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. 5). The proportion of <lb/>those with good adherence (≥80% of expected doses <lb/>taken) was also lower in those with a missing outcome <lb/>compared to those with an outcome available in the non-<lb/>incarcerated population (Supplementary Table S4) <lb/>(further explored in the sensitivity analysis and discus-<lb/>sion sections). <lb/>Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of those <lb/>included (n = 80,535), 8554 (10.6%) of whom were <lb/>incarcerated at the time of their TB diagnosis. 47,133 <lb/>individuals received their TB care pre-COVID-19, <lb/>n = 15,044 partially during COVID-19, and n = 18,355 <lb/>fully during COVID-19 (n = 3 missing COVID-19 <lb/>grouping as missing data on treatment regimen for <lb/>these 3 cases precluded COVID-19 period assignment). <lb/>Those receiving their TB diagnosis during incarceration <lb/>were younger than the non-incarcerated population <lb/>(mean (SD): 41.2 (18.5) (non-incarcerated) vs. 32.2 (10.4) <lb/>(incarcerated)), and a higher proportion were male <lb/>(99.5% male (incarcerated) vs. 61.4% male (non-incar-<lb/>cerated)), were smokers, and had TB previously, but a <lb/>lower proportion had diabetes (Table 3). The incarcer-<lb/>ated population was also more adherent to TB treat-<lb/>ment, likely due to stricter treatment monitoring in <lb/>prisons. <lb/>As models were fit separately for 1) non-incarcerated, <lb/>2) incarcerated, and 3) all (incarcerated and non-<lb/>incarcerated) cases notified, missing data patterns <lb/>were explored for all three datasets. The missing data <lb/>pattern was arbitrary (non-monotone) in all three <lb/>models. Missingness at random (MAR) is the likely <lb/>missingness mechanism; missingness completely at <lb/>random (MCAR) was ruled out (Little&apos;s test p ≤ 0.001) <lb/>(refer to Table 3 caption for breakdown of covariate <lb/>missingness by incarceration status). Multiple imputa-<lb/>tion by chained equations (MICE) was used to impute <lb/>missing values for covariates (using m = 20 imputa-<lb/>tions, as considered sufficient for moderately missing <lb/>data). 45 Imputation diagnostics are described in <lb/>Supplementary Section S3. <lb/>Results of the main analysis (using the imputed data) <lb/>are shown in Table 4 (for the relationship between age <lb/>and treatment success, see Fig. 6).

In the incarcerated <lb/>population however, sex, smoking and health insur-<lb/>ance type were not significant predictors of treatment <lb/>outcome (Table 4). <lb/>In a further model among the total population, <lb/>including an interaction term between incarceration <lb/>status and COVID-19 period (Supplementary Table S6) <lb/>found a higher likelihood of treatment success among <lb/>people incarcerated at the time of their diagnosis (OR <lb/>for treatment success among those incarcerated (vs. not <lb/>incarcerated) in the pre-COVID-19 period: 1.52, 95% CI: <lb/>1.39-1.67), but also found that incarceration does not <lb/>significantly modify the effect of COVID-19 on TB <lb/>treatment outcome (TB care entirely during COVID-19: <lb/>incarcerated, OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.92-1.25. TB care <lb/>partially during COVID-19: incarcerated, OR: 1.03, 95% <lb/>CI: 0.87-1.22). <lb/>Sensitivity analysis <lb/>In the first sensitivity analysis, estimates using MICE to <lb/>impute missing covariate data (the main analysis) were <lb/>compared to estimates resulting from complete case <lb/>analysis only (removal of observations with missing <lb/>covariate data).

			<body>pronounced in the non-incarcerated population than in <lb/>the incarcerated population, suggesting reduced <lb/>disruption of TB services in the prison setting. This is <lb/>likely due to on-site TB screening at entry into prisons as <lb/>well as uninterrupted identification of symptomatic pa-<lb/>tients by health promoters and TB nurses in prisons in <lb/>Peru, which continued to facilitate case detection in the <lb/>incarcerated population even during COVID-19. <lb/>Further, fluctuations are observed in the trend in noti-<lb/>fications in the non-incarcerated population but are ab-<lb/>sent in the incarcerated population trend. This is <lb/>possibly due to TB case notifications in the incarcerated <lb/>population being less sensitive to factors that may <lb/>impact notifications in the general population, such as <lb/>seasonality, changes in care-seeking behaviour, etc. <lb/>Given the enclosed carceral setting, external factors <lb/>affecting transmission may be less influential, and <lb/>fluctuations in care-seeking may be less visible due to <lb/>regular screening and on-site clinics in prisons. <lb/>In addition, we show that, in the non-incarcerated <lb/>population, TB treatment success was significantly <lb/>lower in those who received their TB care entirely or <lb/>partially during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to <lb/>pre-COVID-19, but that this was not the case in the <lb/>incarcerated population. This suggests COVID-19-<lb/>related disruptions adversely affected TB care in Peru <lb/>overall, especially in those receiving all of their TB care <lb/>during the pandemic, but that disruptions experienced <lb/>in the community may have differed from those expe-<lb/>rienced by incarcerated populations. For example, <lb/>barriers to seeking care may have been accentuated in <lb/>non-incarcerated populations who faced clinic closures <lb/>or reduced clinic hours, 46 or who had to commute to <lb/>clinics in the context of transport restrictions, while <lb/>incarcerated populations retained on-site access to care <lb/>(as the on-site TB clinic sections of prisons remained <lb/>accessible during the usual hours throughout the <lb/>pandemic). Testing this via an interaction term, how-<lb/>ever, we found that incarceration is not a significant <lb/>effect modifier of the relationship between COVID-19 <lb/>period and TB treatment outcome; but found that <lb/>incarceration (at time of diagnosis) is independently <lb/>associated with a higher likelihood of treatment success. <lb/>Higher TB treatment success in people experiencing <lb/>incarceration has also been found in other studies, 17,47-49 <lb/>and possible explanations for this include enhanced TB <lb/>screening (e.g., at entry into prison and regularly <lb/>thereafter) or treatment monitoring in this population. <lb/>This is plausible especially in light of specific in-<lb/>terventions implemented to improve TB management <lb/>in prisons in Peru, financed by The Global Fund, 50,51 <lb/>including early TB screening initiatives (at prison en-<lb/>try and annually). 51 <lb/>Similarly, the fact that the proportion of missing <lb/>treatment outcome data was lower in the incarcerated <lb/>than non-incarcerated population could be either due to <lb/>easier on-site follow-up of patients in prisons, or due to <lb/>the fact that incarcerated patients are more likely to be <lb/>assigned an outcome of lost to follow-up (rather than <lb/>missing) upon release from prison. <lb/>In terms of factors associated with treatment success <lb/>in the overall population, our findings align with other <lb/>studies that have found male sex, 52 smoking, 53,54 living <lb/>with HIV and relapse or previous treatment for TB 55,56 to <lb/>be associated with lower treatment success. <lb/>The fact that sex and health insurance type were not <lb/>significant predictors of treatment outcome in the <lb/>incarcerated population, however, is likely due to the <lb/>Fig. 6: Non-linear relationship of age vs. treatment success. Penalised spline functions for age ((a) df = 4, (b) df = 4, and (c) df = 2). Plots show <lb/>predicted values of probability of treatment success across values of age, holding all other covariates constant (COVID-19 period = Pre-COVID-<lb/>19, sex = male, HIV = negative, diabetes = no, smoking = no, adherence category ≥ 80% of doses taken, insurance type = public, case <lb/>type = new, site of TB = pulmonary) i.e., these predictions do not represent treatment success probabilities for the overall population but for a <lb/>new case of pulmonary TB in a HIV-negative, non-diabetic, non-smoking, ≥ 80% adherent male with public health insurance, receiving TB care <lb/>pre-COVID-19. Shaded area = 95% CI. <lb/></body>

			<body>low variation in these factors in this population (most <lb/>incarcerated people being male and having public health <lb/>insurance). <lb/>Regarding adherence as a predictor of treatment <lb/>success, although our observed protective effect of <lb/>adherence is expected, the strong effect observed here <lb/>may be an underestimation of the true effect, given that <lb/>expected doses were based on initial regimen assigned, <lb/>and therefore inadequately reflect adherence in patients <lb/>whose treatment was extended (who are also more likely <lb/>to have had poorer outcomes). In addition, the fact that <lb/>the proportion of those with good adherence (≥80% of <lb/>expected doses taken) was lower in those with a missing <lb/>outcome compared to those with an outcome available <lb/>(in the non-incarcerated population) could potentially <lb/>bias results, given that those with low adherence are <lb/>expected to also have a lower likelihood of treatment <lb/>success. However, as sensitivity analyses showed that <lb/>exclusion of those with missing outcome vs. their <lb/>recategorization as having had an unsuccessful outcome <lb/>did not significantly alter estimates, this is not expected <lb/>to have biased the findings. <lb/>Comparing our findings to other South American <lb/>countries, aside from Peru, Brazil is the only other <lb/>South American country identified by the WHO as <lb/>among the top 16 contributors to the global shortfall in <lb/>TB case notifications in 2020 (vs. 2019). 3 An ITS study in <lb/>Brazil, also comparing pre-and during-COVID-19 <lb/>trends in TB case notifications similarly found an <lb/>increasing trend in TB notifications pre-COVID-19, and <lb/>a decreasing trend between 2010 and 2021 (i.e., <lb/>including the pandemic period). The monthly percent <lb/>decrease in case notifications in this period (2010-2021) <lb/>was found to be 8.10% (95% CI: 0.54%-15.08%). 57 <lb/>Another Brazilian study, comparing TB case notifica-<lb/>tions in January to July 2019 vs. January to July 2020 in <lb/>one state in Brazil (Bahia) found a 26.4% decrease in <lb/>notifications in the latter period. 58 Although these <lb/>studies and our own echo global findings regarding the <lb/>impact of COVID-19 on TB, 3,59 comparison across set-<lb/>tings and studies is difficult due to the heterogeneity of <lb/>methods used and of COVID-19 period definitions. <lb/>Our study has several limitations. One limitation is <lb/>that although we have investigated the impact of COVID-<lb/>19 on TB case notifications and outcomes in the incar-<lb/>cerated and non-incarcerated populations of Peru, it is <lb/>difficult to draw conclusions about the mechanisms <lb/>behind this impact. For example, the fact that TB case <lb/>notifications dropped during COVID-19 is expected to be <lb/>a result of disruptions to TB diagnosis and reporting <lb/>services, rather than representing an actual decrease in TB <lb/>incidence, however, the specific mechanisms contributing <lb/>to fewer TB diagnoses being captured in this period (e.g., <lb/>changes in care-seeking behaviour vs. health systems <lb/>disruptions, etc.) cannot be elucidated from this study. <lb/>Unfortunately, lacking data on symptom onset, we <lb/>could not explore diagnostic delays (i.e., time from <lb/>symptom onset to diagnosis). A suitable indicator of <lb/>disease severity was also unavailable in SIGTB and <lb/>could therefore not be used as a proxy for diagnostic <lb/>delay. We therefore could not explore whether earlier <lb/>diagnosis acted as a mediator of the effect of COVID-19 <lb/>period on TB treatment success. Earlier diagnosis in <lb/>prisons compared to in the non-incarcerated population <lb/>however is possible, given that detainees receive a <lb/>physical health evaluation at entry, and that detainee <lb/>health promoters and peer-supporters assist in identi-<lb/>fying TB symptoms early among cellmates. In addition, <lb/>given that incarcerated populations are generally <lb/>younger than the overall population, it is possible that <lb/>competing risks, such as COVID-19 mortality, differ-<lb/>entially affected the incarcerated and non-incarcerated <lb/>populations and subsequently their TB outcomes, but <lb/>it is difficult to separate this effect from other influences <lb/>like increased COVID-19 transmission in prisons. <lb/>Other limitations of our study include challenges <lb/>inherent in the use of secondary data collected for <lb/>routine programmatic purposes. This includes the fact <lb/>that cases are often under-notified in national TB pro-<lb/>gram databases, 60,61 including SIGTB, 62 with notified TB <lb/>cases in Peru representing 81.4% of the estimated na-<lb/>tional burden prior to COVID-19 (in 2019) 63 and 60.9% <lb/>of the estimated burden in 2020. 63 This suggests that <lb/>estimates of the effect of receiving TB treatment during <lb/>vs. prior to COVID-19 on treatment success could be <lb/>biased towards the null, if patients with poorer treat-<lb/>ment outcomes were less likely to be notified during the <lb/>pandemic. <lb/>Another limitation is the lack of a dynamic indicator <lb/>of incarceration status in national TB program data. As <lb/>incarceration is only captured in the SIGTB database for <lb/>those who received a TB diagnosis while incarcerated, <lb/>the present analysis could not consider prior incarcera-<lb/>tion, incarceration after case notification, or length of <lb/>incarceration. Although the majority of incarcerated in-<lb/>dividuals in Peru serve sentences longer than 5 years, 64 <lb/>individual-level data on length of stay would have <lb/>allowed a more precise-and dynamic-definition of <lb/>incarceration status in the analysis. In addition, other <lb/>data limitations necessitated reliance on imperfect in-<lb/>dicators. For example, the lack of data on individuals&apos; <lb/>socioeconomic status meant that health insurance type <lb/>was used as an imperfect proxy. Similarly, our estimates <lb/>of the effect of adherence on treatment outcomes are <lb/>limited due to having information only on the number of <lb/>doses at exit, but not the proportion of doses missed <lb/>throughout an individual&apos;s treatment. As a result, the <lb/>adherence proportion was estimated based on in-<lb/>dividuals&apos; total doses expected for their treatment <lb/>regimen and their time on treatment before exit, possibly <lb/>leading to imperfect classification of true adherence. <lb/>Strengths of our study include its size and repre-<lb/>sentativeness of all case notifications in the country. In <lb/>addition, we sought to underline the urgent yet under-<lb/></body>

			<body>studied public health concern of TB in prisons, high-<lb/>lighting the impact of this disease in a neglected <lb/>population. Prisons must not be overlooked in the <lb/>overall TB response, firstly because the right to health <lb/>extends to individuals experiencing incarceration, as it <lb/>does to everyone. Incarcerated populations should <lb/>therefore not be subjected to conditions that put their <lb/>health at much higher risk than the general population. <lb/>Secondly, our analysis suggests a lower extent of <lb/>COVID-related TB care disruptions in prisons, sug-<lb/>gesting that TB services among the incarcerated popu-<lb/>lation were less sensitive to COVID-19-related <lb/>disruptions than TB services in the non-incarcerated <lb/>population. This resilience of TB services in the car-<lb/>ceral setting to external disruptions, in combination <lb/>with the high burden of TB in this population, high-<lb/>lights prisons as unique settings in which TB prevention <lb/>and treatment is feasible yet urgent, making clear that <lb/>prisons should be key priorities for TB elimination ef-<lb/>forts in Peru and elsewhere. <lb/></body>
