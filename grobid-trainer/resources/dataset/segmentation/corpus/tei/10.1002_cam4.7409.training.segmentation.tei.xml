			<body>1 <lb/>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), <lb/>caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus <lb/>2 (SARS-CoV-2), is mostly achieved through nucleic <lb/>acid testing based on reverse transcriptase quantitative <lb/>polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology. While <lb/>nucleic acid testing has high sensitivity and specificity, <lb/>it is limited by the need for central laboratory, resulting <lb/>in a delay in detection. 1 The failure to obtain a timely <lb/>COVID-19 diagnosis result can cause significant delays <lb/>in treating emergent patients. Antigen testing has been <lb/>widely promoted as a fast detection method for COVID-<lb/>19 using upper respiratory specimens, 1 which however <lb/>suffers from false negative results. 1,2 To date, further devel-<lb/>opment is still needed to improve the diagnosis efficiency <lb/>of COVID-19. <lb/>It has been proved that immune response moni-<lb/>toring can provide sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>infection 3 and reveal information about disease severity <lb/>and host characteristics. 4 Matrix-assisted laser desorp-<lb/>tion/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-<lb/>TOF MS) has been widely used in the analysis of <lb/>biomolecules such as peptides in various types of clinical <lb/>specimens. 5 The technique holds the advantage of rapid <lb/>analysis, high sensitivity and robustness in usage. At the <lb/>onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Nachtigall et al. proposed <lb/>a MALDI-TOF-based method for COVID-19 diagnosis by <lb/>detecting the immune response against the virus in nasal <lb/>cavity. 6 Since the late 2020, the virus has undergone sev-<lb/>eral mutations, resulting in the emergence of different <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Alpha, 7 Beta, 8 Gamma, 9 <lb/>Delta 10 and Omicron 11 that circulate strongly in different <lb/>regions and countries. The suitability of previous MALDI-<lb/>TOF-based methods for the current epidemic context is <lb/>uncertain. <lb/>Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) <lb/>reported that the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains in China <lb/>since 2022 primarily involved the Omicron variant with <lb/>various evolutionary branches. Currently, the analysis <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is mainly based on the next-<lb/>generation sequencing. 12 However, the method is at high <lb/>cost and is time consuming. New methods have been devel-<lb/>oped for the detection and identification of SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>variants, including PCR-based methods. 13 These meth-<lb/>ods share the same limitations as the RT-qPCR in the <lb/>detection of original strains. Under this circumstance, in <lb/>this study we evaluated the MALDI-TOF-based analysis <lb/>of nasal swabs for the diagnosis of patients infected with <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. A total of 135 Chinese participants <lb/>were involved in the study, resulting in 325 SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>positive nasal swab samples and 221 SARS-CoV-2 neg-<lb/>ative samples. Based on unsupervised and supervised <lb/>statistical analysis, 25 MALDI-TOF feature peaks were <lb/>identified from a training dataset and then validated on <lb/>an independent test dataset. Using a random forest (RF) <lb/>classification model, the accuracy of 97%, false negative <lb/>rate of 0%, and false positive rate of 7.6% were achieved for <lb/>the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Combin-<lb/>ing the MALDI-TOF analysis with top-down proteomics, 14 <lb/>we identified four potential protein biomarkers, that is, <lb/>humanin-like 4 (HN4), thymosin beta-10 (Tβ10), thymosin <lb/>beta-4 (Tβ4), and statherin, in the nasal swab for the diag-<lb/>nosis of COVID-19. It was further demonstrated that the <lb/>four potential protein biomarkers can be used to differenti-<lb/>ate patients infected by original strains of SARS-CoV-2 and <lb/>patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strains. <lb/>2 <lb/>METHODS <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Sample collection and storage <lb/>Positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab samples <lb/>from mildly or asymptomatically infected individuals as <lb/>well as volunteers without SARS-CoV-2 infection were col-<lb/>lected from Beijing Ditan Hospital during March-April of <lb/>2022. The study involved 135 volunteers, each of whom <lb/>underwent three to six rounds of sampling. Nucleic acid <lb/>testing was applied on the samples, and the Ct value of <lb/>40 was considered as the criteria of SARS-CoV-2 posi-<lb/>tive. After collection, samples were kept in nasal swab <lb/>preservation solution, shaken for 5 s, left to rest for 10 s, <lb/>and then stored at room temperature. MALDI-TOF MS <lb/>analysis was performed for all samples within 72 h of <lb/>sampling. Participants were excluded or withdrawn from <lb/>the study if any of the following conditions occurred: <lb/>less than 6 years old, serious comorbidities, and discon-<lb/>tinuation in sampling. Samples were excluded if there <lb/>were no valid nucleic acid results, or if the sample col-<lb/>lection or preservation did not meet the requirements <lb/>aforementioned. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2 <lb/>MALDI-TOF MS analysis <lb/>The nasal swab was placed in nasal swab preservation <lb/>solution and mixed thoroughly. The swab was removed <lb/>and 1 µL of the solution was deposited on a stainless-steel <lb/>MALDI target plate and dried at room temperature. One <lb/>µL of matrix solution was pipetted to cover the sample spot <lb/>and dried at room temperature for MALDI-TOF MS analy-<lb/>sis using a Clin-TOF-II instrument (Bioyong Technologies <lb/>Inc.). Mass calibration was performed using a standard <lb/>calibration mixture of peptides and proteins to reach a <lb/>mass tolerance of 500 ppm. Mass spectra were acquired in <lb/>the mass range of m/z 2000-20,000. Fifty laser bombard-<lb/>ment positions were selected for each sample spot and each <lb/>position was bombarded 10 times. The final superimposed <lb/>spectrum was saved. <lb/>2.3 <lb/>MALDI-TOF MS data processing and <lb/>analysis <lb/>Raw data of MALDI-TOF MS were processed by an R <lb/>package, MALDIquant, 15 with operations including sqrt <lb/>transformation, savitzkyGolay smoothing with a half win-<lb/>dow size of 50, and sensitive non-linear iterative peak-<lb/>clipping baseline correction. Then, peak detection was <lb/>performed using the median absolute deviation (MAD) <lb/>method with a half window size of 70 and a signal-to-noise <lb/>threshold of 4. Minifrequency (the minimal frequency <lb/>of features detected across all the samples) was set as <lb/>0.25. Peaks were then binned by binPeaks with a tol-<lb/>erance of 0.005 for all samples to get the features. The <lb/>features obtained as a matrix table was then processed <lb/>by log 2 transformation and quantile normalization using <lb/>Metaboanalyst 16 (McGill University, Montreal, Canada, <lb/>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/). The processed MALDI-<lb/>MS feature matrix is shown in Supporting Information <lb/>S1. <lb/>Four machine learning algorithms, that is, partial least <lb/>squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), logistic regres-<lb/>sion (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and RF, were <lb/>used to generate the classification models. p-Value was <lb/>calculated by the Mann-Whitney test between the COVID-<lb/>19 cohort and the non-COVID-19 cohort. The diagnostic <lb/>efficiency of the models was evaluated by the receiver oper-<lb/>ating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and <lb/>specificity. Accuracy was defined as a ratio between the <lb/>correctly classified samples to the total number of sam-<lb/>ples (TP + TN)/(P + N). Sensitivity represents the correctly <lb/>classified positive samples to the total number of posi-<lb/>tive samples (TP/P). Specificity represents the correctly <lb/>classified negative samples to the total number of nega-<lb/>tive samples (TN/N). TP stands for true positive, TN for <lb/>true negative, P for positive, and N for negative. All the <lb/>statistical analysis and machine learning were performed <lb/>using Metaboanalyst 16 (McGill University; https://www. <lb/>metaboanalyst.ca/). <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Top-down proteomics analysis <lb/>One nasal swab sample was added with 6 mL of ace-<lb/>tone, allowing proteins to precipitate overnight at -20 • C. <lb/>The precipitates were dissolved in 20 µL 8 M urea solu-<lb/>tion, and subsequently diluted with 50 mM ABC solution, <lb/>resulting in a final volume of 200 µL. The protein solution <lb/>was reduced with 10 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine <lb/>(TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) at 55 • C for 1 h, followed with <lb/>alkylation by 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma-Aldrich <lb/>Co.) at room temperature. The alkylation was protected <lb/>from light for 30 min. The reduced and alkylated proteins <lb/>were then desalted with a C4 column (Phenomenex, 15 µm, <lb/>300Å) and dried under vacuum. <lb/>For liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) <lb/>analysis, 10 µg of the desalted protein was dissolved in 10 <lb/>µL of ultrapure water (Millipore Simplicity System). LC <lb/>was performed with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano <lb/>(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an analytical column (360 <lb/>µm od × 75 µm id, 60 cm length) packed with Phenomenex <lb/>Jupiter C4 beads (5 µm, 300 Å). A holding column (360 µm <lb/>od × 200 µm id, 5 cm length) packed with Phenomenex <lb/>Jupiter C4 beads (5 µm, 300 Å) was used. The mobile phase <lb/>consisted of Buffer A (99.8% H 2 O and 0.2 % FA) and Buffer <lb/>B (99.8% ACN and 0.2 % FA). Loading pump flow rate <lb/>was set as 5 µL/min. Nano pump flow rate was set as 300 <lb/>nL/min. Note that 4.8% Buffer B was maintained for 6 min, <lb/>followed by a gradient of 4.8%-18.3 % Buffer B in 1 min, <lb/>18.3%-64.7% Buffer B in 90 min, 64.7%-96% Buffer B in <lb/>5 min, 96% Buffer B maintained for 5 min, and 96%-4.8% <lb/>Buffer B in 20 min for equilibration. <lb/>MS analysis was performed on Orbitrap Exploris 480 <lb/>(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with nanospray flex (Thermo <lb/>Fisher Scientific). The ion transfer capillary temperature <lb/>was set to 300 • C. The spray voltage was set to 1.9 kV. The <lb/>primary MS acquisition range was from m/z 600 to 3000 <lb/>with a mass resolution of 240k @ m/z = 200. The auto-<lb/>matic gain control target (AGC target) was set to 3 × 10 6 <lb/>and the maximum injection time was set to 250 ms. The <lb/>mass resolution of the tandem MS/MS was 120k @ m/z <lb/>= 200. In data-dependent acquisition (DDA), top 20 pre-<lb/>cursors were selected for the MS/MS analysis. The AGC <lb/>target value was set to 5 × 10 5 . The maximum ion injection <lb/>time was set to 250 ms. The precursor ion isolation window <lb/>was set to m/z 1.4. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30.0 s, <lb/>and the higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) stepped <lb/>collision normalized energy was set to 30%. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.5 <lb/>Top-down proteomics data analysis <lb/>ProteinGoggle 2.0 17 was used to process the top-down <lb/>proteomic data. A database of human protein sequences <lb/>was selected, with fixed modifications being alkylation <lb/>on cysteine, variable modifications being methylation, <lb/>dimethylation, trimethylation on lysine, acetylation on <lb/>lysine, methylation, dimethylation on arginine, phospho-<lb/>rylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine, and oxidation <lb/>on methionine. ProteinGoggle was used to build the pro-<lb/>tein analysis database and to analyze the MS data. Based <lb/>on the library search results, data with post-translational <lb/>modification (PTM) score ≥ 1, proteoform score ≥ 1, and <lb/>matched fragment ions of every proteoform ≥ 6 were fil-<lb/>tered in the identification list. False discovery rate (FDR) <lb/>threshold was 1%. The data were de-weighted accord-<lb/>ing to the protein sequence number (accession), protein <lb/>sequence (sequence), and modification (modifications) in <lb/>the total protein identification list to obtain the iden-<lb/>tification list of different modified proteins (Sheet 1 of <lb/>Supporting Information S2). The data were de-weighted <lb/>according to the protein sequence number (accession) in <lb/>the total protein identification list to obtain the identifica-<lb/>tion list of de-duplicated proteins (Sheet 2 of Supporting <lb/>Information S2). <lb/>2.6 <lb/>Annotation of MALDI-TOF MS <lb/>peaks <lb/>Proteins identified by the top-down proteomics were con-<lb/>sidered to annotate the MALDI-TOF MS peaks. Only single <lb/>charge was considered for MALDI-TOF MS peaks, and the <lb/>mass tolerance of 1000 ppm was considered. <lb/>2.7 <lb/>Data availability <lb/>The top-down mass spectrometry proteomics data have <lb/>been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium <lb/>(http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the <lb/>iProX partner repository 18 with the dataset identifier <lb/>PXD043690 <lb/>(https://www.iprox.cn/page/PSV023.html; <lb/>?url=1707709840364lOW2; password: h4aP) <lb/>2.8 <lb/>Ethical statement <lb/>The study was carried out in strict accordance with the <lb/>Declaration of Helsinki, the National Code of Practice for <lb/>the Quality Management of Drug Clinical Trials, and the <lb/>Regulations on Clinical Trials of Medical Devices, as well <lb/>as other policies and regulations. The study was approved <lb/>by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Ditan Hospital affil-<lb/>iated to Capital Medical University (Jingdi Lun Reagent <lb/>No. [2022] (008-02)). Informed consent forms were signed <lb/>by all subjects involved in the study or legal guardians of <lb/>minors under 16 years. <lb/>3 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>The study aims to validate the effectiveness of MALDI-<lb/>TOF analysis of nasal swab samples for the diagnosis of <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Nasal swab samples were <lb/>analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS to collect molecular mass fin-<lb/>gerprints. Machine learning was then applied to extract <lb/>feature peaks and to build a classifier, 5 which can diagnose <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection (Figure 1). In practice, <lb/>after analyzing the nasal swab samples using MALDI-<lb/>TOF, the obtained MS data can be inputted into the <lb/>pre-established classifier to obtain the diagnostic results. <lb/>We collected 325 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasal swab sam-<lb/>ples (P) and 221 SARS-CoV-2 negative nasal swab samples <lb/>(N) in the Beijing Ditan Hospital during March-April of <lb/>2022. Nucleic acid assay was applied to the nasal swab <lb/>samples, and the Ct value of 40 was considered as the crite-<lb/>ria of SARS-CoV-2 positive. All the patients were infected <lb/>by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strains. A random alloca-<lb/>tion process was employed to divide the collected nasal <lb/>swab samples into two sets, namely, a training set and <lb/>a test set. The training set consisted of 227 positive and <lb/>155 negative samples, while the test set included 98 posi-<lb/>tive and 66 negative samples (Figure 2A). The nasal swab <lb/>samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The <lb/>resulting mass spectra were processed by MALDIquant <lb/>for feature extraction and analyzed by Metaboanalyst for <lb/>multi-variant statistical analysis and machine learning. <lb/>Totally, 236 peaks were obtained after data processing of <lb/>all the MS raw files (Supporting Information S1). <lb/>In the mass range of m/z 2000-20,000, we observed a <lb/>similar number of features between group P and group N <lb/>(Figure S1). The spectral processing parameters settings <lb/>for both groups were consistent, using the MAD method <lb/>with a half window size of 70 and a signal-to-noise ratio <lb/>of 4, as detailed in Section 2. We focus on the mass range <lb/>between m/z 2000 and 20,000 to detect changes in pro-<lb/>tein expression due to the human immune response to <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 infection. This m/z range can capture a wide <lb/>array of biomolecular changes, including those in pro-<lb/>teins and polypeptides. For proteins with m/z larger than <lb/>20,000, the detection sensitivity by MALDI-TOF MS is low, <lb/>and we could hardly observe any efficient signal. For the <lb/>m/z smaller than 2000, the signal is mainly from matri-<lb/>ces, metabolites, lipids, and small peptides.

			<body>samples. However, different methods in MALDI-TOF MS <lb/>analysis should be employed, such as the usage of nanoma-<lb/>terials to assist the ionization of small molecules, 19 which <lb/>can bring additional problems such as the consistency <lb/>between experiments. <lb/>After data collection, machine learning was used to <lb/>identify distinctive features between SARS-CoV-2 positive <lb/>and negative samples. The unsupervised principal compo-<lb/>nent analysis analysis did not reveal significant difference <lb/>between the two groups in the training set, indicating <lb/>that there were only subtle differences between the two <lb/>groups (Figure 2B). Then, distinctive features between the <lb/>groups were extracted using PLS-DA (variable importance <lb/>in projection [VIP] &gt; 1.5) and volcano plot analysis (Fold <lb/>change (FC) &gt; 1.5, p-value &lt; .05) (Figure 2C,D; Figure <lb/>S2), wherein 25 distinctive features were obtained from <lb/>the training set under the combined criteria of PLS-DA <lb/>and volcano plot. The 15 peaks with the largest VIP are <lb/>shown in Figure 2E. Figure 2F shows the heatmap of the 25 <lb/>features between the SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative <lb/>samples in the training set. It was clearly observed that <lb/>features like m/z 3334, 2419, 3219, and 4936 were downreg-<lb/>ulated in the SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, while features <lb/>like m/z 4189, 4149, and 4167 were upregulated in the <lb/>SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. <lb/>The Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric statistical <lb/>method, was rigorously applied to evaluate the selected <lb/>feature peaks identified within the training dataset. This <lb/>test, known for its effectiveness in comparing differences <lb/>between two independent samples, was specifically uti-<lb/>lized to assess the distinctiveness of the features between <lb/>the positive group and the negative group. As meticulously <lb/>illustrated in Figure 3, the analysis yielded statistically sig-<lb/>nificant results for all the features, demonstrating a clear <lb/>and consistent differentiation between the two groups. <lb/>This outcome reinforces the validity of these features in <lb/>distinguishing between the positive and negative samples, <lb/>underpinning their potential utility in further analytical <lb/>applications. <lb/>We further evaluated the potential of the 25 feature <lb/>peaks to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative <lb/>samples on the test dataset. Leveraging unsupervised clus-<lb/>ter analysis using the 25 feature peaks, 89% of the test <lb/>samples could be accurately classified, demonstrating a <lb/>potential of the features in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-<lb/>2 infection (Figure S3a). This was further confirmed by <lb/>the heatmap analysis of the 25 feature peaks using the test <lb/>dataset (Figure S3b). Then, four different machine learn-<lb/>ing methods, that is, PLS-DA, LR, SVM, and RF, were used <lb/>to generate the classification models using the training <lb/>data with the 25 feature peaks, and tested on the test data <lb/>set. PLS-DA plays a crucial role in chemometrics and bioin-<lb/>formatics, excelling in the analysis of high-dimensional <lb/>data through dimension reduction and maximizing dif-<lb/>ferences between classes. In contrast, LR is preferred <lb/>for binary classification tasks, such as medical diagnos-<lb/>tics, by predicting the probabilities of categories and <lb/>focusing on the likelihood of outcomes rather than reduc-<lb/>ing data dimensions. SVM excels in high-dimensional <lb/>spaces, including text and image classification, by effec-<lb/>tively distinguishing between categories with an optimally <lb/>determined boundary, outperforming LR and PLS-DA in <lb/>managing complex data boundaries. RF, by integrating <lb/>multiple decision trees, enhances model stability and accu-<lb/>racy, especially for large datasets with high-dimensional <lb/>features, and is more adept at reducing the risk of over-<lb/>fitting compared to LR or SVM. 20 Together, these methods <lb/>showcase distinct advantages in data processing and prob-<lb/>lem solving, and hence the different machine learning <lb/>methods were selected to build classification models for <lb/>the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The area under <lb/>the curve (AUC) values for all the four machine learn-<lb/>ing methods were around 0.9, reflecting a high degree <lb/>of authenticity in diagnosis (Figure 4A-D). The confu-<lb/>sion matrix showed a low number of false positive and <lb/>false negative samples (Figure 4E-H). The AUC, accuracy, <lb/>specificity, and sensitivity for the four machine learning <lb/>methods can be found in Table S1. RF exhibited the high-<lb/>est accuracy of 97%, the false negative rate of 0%, and the <lb/>false positive rate of 7.6%. Above all, RF was determined <lb/>as the optimal method for SARS-CoV-2 infection detection <lb/>using nasal swab samples and MALDI-TOF analysis. <lb/>To identify the biomarkers correlated with the 25 <lb/>MALDI-TOF feature peaks, top-down proteomics was <lb/>employed to annotate the MALDI-TOF peaks (Support-<lb/>ing Information S2). Four proteins, that is, humanin-like <lb/>4 (HN4), thymosin beta-10 (Tβ10), thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4), <lb/>and statherin, were identified from four of the 25 features, <lb/>as shown in Table S2. The rest features cannot be matched <lb/>to any of the proteins or protein fragments identified by the <lb/>top-down proteomics. <lb/>We further compared our data to the ones reported by <lb/>Nachtigall et al., 6 which were from the patients infected <lb/>by the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. A total <lb/>of 211 positive samples were included in the study by <lb/>Nachtigall et al. from three labs, and we chose the 44 <lb/>positive samples from lab 2 and lab 3 to compare with <lb/>the 325 samples of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strains-<lb/>infected samples in our study. The spectral processing <lb/>parameters for the original strains were consistent to the <lb/>aforementioned ones for the Omicron strains. A Monte <lb/>Carlo cross-validation analysis was conducted to differen-<lb/>tiate between samples infected with the original strains <lb/>and those infected with the Omicron strains using the <lb/>four identified protein biomarkers through RF. Two-<lb/>thirds of the samples were used to evaluate the feature <lb/></body>

			<body>F I G U R E 4 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and confusion matrix of the prediction results on the test samples for severe <lb/>acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron infection diagnosis. Four machining learning were used consisting of <lb/>random forest (RF), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The <lb/>classifier was built on the training dataset with the 25 distinctive features. <lb/>4 <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Epidemic infectious diseases, such as the 2002 outbreak <lb/>of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the <lb/>2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2, have caused significant <lb/>damage to both human life and property. These diseases <lb/>are characterized by rapid mutations in virus, making it <lb/>challenging to sustain investment in the development of <lb/>prevention and treatment methods. To date, there have <lb/>been a number of methods developed for the diagnosis <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR is considered as the <lb/>gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 infection detection, with <lb/>the advantages of highly sensitive and specific detection, <lb/>but is time consuming and requires specialized equip-<lb/>ment. Serological tests, such as ELISA, are effective in <lb/>detecting past infections, but their utility is limited in iden-<lb/>tifying current infections. 21 Antigen testing offers a quick <lb/>and cost-effective screening method, but with lower sen-<lb/>sitivity compared to RT-PCR. 22 MALDI-TOF MS is less <lb/>common but promising in SARS-CoV-2 infection detec-<lb/>tion, provides a rapid and broad-spectrum analysis, aiding <lb/>in understanding the immune response against the virus <lb/>infection. <lb/>In 2020, Nachtigall et al. introduced an innovative and <lb/>pioneering approach to diagnose COVID-19 by MALDI-<lb/>TOF. 6 A total of 362 nasal mucus samples collected from <lb/>the South American region were analyzed, with the focus <lb/>on immune changes in the nasal cavity following COVID-<lb/>19 infection. 6 Given the persistent and dynamic mutations <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2, 23 disease severity and immune responses <lb/>have correspondingly changed. As a result, the MALDI-<lb/>TOF-based COVID-19 detection method may no longer be <lb/>universally applicable. To assess the suitability of MALDI-<lb/>TOF technology in response to changes in the epidemio-<lb/>logical context, we analyzed nasal swab samples collected <lb/>from China in 2022 and compared our findings to those <lb/>by Nachtigall et al. 6 Based on the variance with the intro-<lb/>duction of virus mutations, the capability of MALDI-TOF <lb/>technology in diagnosing COVID-19 caused by various <lb/>mutants of SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated. With the easing <lb/>of COVID-19 policies, the gathering of large-scale COVID-<lb/>19 samples has gained increased significance. Comparing <lb/>MALDI-TOF-based diagnostic strategies developed for dif-<lb/>ferent COVID-19 strains and various regional populations <lb/>offer an unprecedented and fascinating perspective. <lb/>Drawing from this concept, our study mainly focuses on <lb/>the immune response caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron <lb/>strains in the nasal cavity. We compared the 25 features <lb/>identified in our study with those by Nachtigall et al. 6 Five <lb/>common features (m/z 3334, 3354, 4167, 4963, and 5219) <lb/></body>

			<body>were discovered, suggesting that different SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>strains may induce similar immune changes in humans. <lb/>While in contrast, unique features were observed in each <lb/>study, suggesting potential alterations linked to COVID-19 <lb/>strains. 23 Among the 25 features identified in our study, <lb/>four were further annotated by top-down proteomic anal-<lb/>ysis, including HN4 (m/z 3334), Tβ10 (m/z 4936), Tβ4 (m/z <lb/>4963), and statherin (m/z 5299). It is noted that the features <lb/>of m/z 3334 and m/z 4963 were also identified by Nachtigall <lb/>et al. 6 We further employed the four features to differenti-<lb/>ate the patients infected by the original strains and the ones <lb/>infected by the Omicron strains, demonstrating the poten-<lb/>tial of the four protein biomarkers in strain-level resolution <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which also highlights the differ-<lb/>ence in immune response against different SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>strains. It should be noted that the main aim of the study <lb/>is to demonstrate the utility of the MALDI-TOF-based <lb/>nasal swabs analysis in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Omi-<lb/>cron infection instead of identifying biomarkers specific to <lb/>the Omicron strains because of the difficulties in collect-<lb/>ing nasal swabs samples of patients infected by different <lb/>strains of SARS-CoV-2. <lb/>Top-down proteomics, combined with MALDI-TOF MS, <lb/>identified four protein biomarkers specific to infections <lb/>caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strain. Top-down pro-<lb/>teomics, which involves the analysis of intact proteins, <lb/>enhances accuracy in proteoforms analysis by preserving <lb/>post-translational modifications and identifying protein <lb/>fragments that can be missed by the typical bottom-up <lb/>methods relying on peptide-based analysis. 24 The top-<lb/>down proteomics are more suitable than the bottom-up <lb/>proteomics to annotate the MALDI-TOF MS features, since <lb/>both techniques observe directly the molecule weights of <lb/>proteins or protein fragments existing in samples, while <lb/>from bottom-up proteomics it is difficult to predict the <lb/>exact proteoforms. However, due to the technique difficul-<lb/>ties, such as the separation of intact proteins, the ionization <lb/>of large proteins, the fragmentation of proteins during tan-<lb/>dem MS analysis, and the detection of ions with large <lb/>m/z, the top-down proteomics identifies limited number <lb/>of proteins. Therefore, only four features were annotated <lb/>as protein biomarkers. <lb/>Tβ4, a small protein consisting of 43 amino acid residues <lb/>with an acetylated N-terminus, is abundantly present <lb/>across human tissues. Tβ4 plays a vital role in control-<lb/>ling actin polymerization and acts as an anti-inflammatory <lb/>and antioxidant agent, further promoting wound recovery <lb/>and angiogenesis. Yu et al. have demonstrated the protec-<lb/>tive effect of recombinant human thymosin beta-4 (rhTβ4) <lb/>against coronavirus infections in mice. 25 Tβ10 is part of <lb/>the thymosin family proteins, which plays crucial roles in <lb/>cell morphology, motility, and cytoskeletal organization. <lb/>Tβ10 has been proven to be involved in the malignant <lb/>processes of many cancers. 26 Statherin, a molecule ini-<lb/>tially discovered in parotid and submandibular-sublingual <lb/>secretions and expressed in submucosal glands, plays a <lb/>crucial role in oral health. It contributes to enamel protec-<lb/>tion, maintains mineral homeostasis, provides lubrication, <lb/>and aids in early microbial colonization. 27 In addition to <lb/>oral health, statherin is present in nasal secretions, where <lb/>it may enhance the overall antimicrobial properties in con-<lb/>junction with proteins like secretory phospholipase A2 and <lb/>defensins. 28 Despite its significance, the existing litera-<lb/>ture offers limited insight into the variations of statherin <lb/>in respiratory tract pathologies. 29 Humanin (HN) and its <lb/>derivatives, including HN4, belong to a family of proteins <lb/>known for their anti-apoptotic properties and regulatory <lb/>role in cellular metabolism. HN, a small protein con-<lb/>sisting of 24 amino acid residues, is recognized for its <lb/>protective capacity against neuronal damage associated <lb/>with Alzheimer&apos;s disease. While previous studies primar-<lb/>ily focus on Alzheimer&apos;s disease, recent findings suggest <lb/>that HN and its derivatives can suppress cell apoptosis <lb/>across a variety of diseases and organ systems, implying a <lb/>more extensive protective effect of the proteins. 30 The rela-<lb/>tionship between HN&apos;s anti-apoptotic capabilities and viral <lb/>infections, as well as the underlying mechanisms, warrants <lb/>additional investigation. <lb/>The limitation of the current study is that influenza <lb/>infection or COVID-19 vaccination may also induce sim-<lb/>ilar immune responses. 31 Therefore, there is a need to <lb/>incorporate a more diverse range of samples in the control <lb/>group. Additionally, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>necessitates continuous updating of markers to maintain <lb/>diagnostic accuracy. Other limitations of the MALDI-TOF-<lb/>based COVID-19 diagnostic model include the need for <lb/>extensive validation of the identified markers in larger <lb/>cohorts to ensure reliability across diverse clinical settings. <lb/>Furthermore, assessing the practicality and cost of inte-<lb/>grating this model into existing diagnostic workflows is <lb/>crucial for routine clinical usage. These factors under-<lb/>score the importance of ongoing research and adaptation <lb/>in response to the dynamic nature of viral pandemics. <lb/>In summary, we demonstrate that the MALDI-TOF <lb/>technology in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection using <lb/>nasal swab samples displays remarkable performance <lb/>with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strains, just as the previous <lb/>study with the original strains of SARS-CoV-2. The rel-<lb/>atively stable diagnostic ability is a promising feature <lb/>of the technique for its potential use in global diag-<lb/>nostics. The discovery of four potential biomarkers, that <lb/>is, HN4, Tβ10, Tβ4, and statherin, can provide valuable <lb/>information to understand the human immune response <lb/>against the virus, and to develop novel diagnosis methods <lb/>based on the biomarkers. Under an extended circum-<lb/>stance, MALDI-TOF-based molecular mass fingerprinting <lb/></body>
