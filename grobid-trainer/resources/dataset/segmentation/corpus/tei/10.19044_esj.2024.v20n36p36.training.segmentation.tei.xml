The research methodology utilizes a qualitative <lb/>approach, specifically a single case study with semi-structured interviews for <lb/>data collection. The theoretical framework incorporates the resource-based <lb/>view (RBV) and contingency theories. The key findings of the study <lb/>emphasize the challenges encountered during information technology <lb/>implementation, especially concerning the complementarity of <lb/>organizational and human resources with information technology resources. <lb/>Based on these challenges, the factors contributing to successful information <lb/>technology implementation are categorized into three groups: pre-<lb/>implementation phase, alignment of information technology strategy, and <lb/>collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders involved in the <lb/>implementation process. <lb/>ESI Preprints <lb/>March 2024 <lb/>www.esipreprints.org <lb/>200 <lb/>Keywords: <lb/>Implementation <lb/>process; <lb/>information <lb/>technology; <lb/>complementarity of resources; IT strategy; cooperation and coordination <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>The digitalization movement has had a significant impact on <lb/>Moroccan companies, leading to the need for accelerated digital <lb/>transformations. Achieving these transformations requires the mobilization <lb/>of multiple resources and personnel to successfully digitize all business and <lb/>strategic processes. Consequently, professionals and researchers have been <lb/>seeking to identify the variables that contribute to successful digital <lb/>transformations in the Moroccan business environment. <lb/>Of all the stages involved in the digital transformation of companies, <lb/>IT implementation stands out as a crucial step for success, as highlighted in <lb/>existing literature. According to Randolph et al. (1990), IT implementation <lb/>refers to the organizational effort of introducing appropriate information <lb/>technologies to a user community. This exploratory case study aims to <lb/>address the questions and concerns of professionals and management science <lb/>and information systems researchers by identifying the key factors involved <lb/>in the digital transformation process in Moroccan companies. The objectives <lb/>of this study are to identify the challenges faced during the IT <lb/>implementation process in Morocco and to explore the determinants of <lb/>successful IT implementation in the Moroccan context. <lb/>By addressing these research questions, this study aims to contribute <lb/>to the existing literature by focusing on the specificities of the Moroccan <lb/>context, which has been underrepresented in previous research. Additionally, <lb/>this study aims to shed light on the challenges hindering the digital <lb/>transformation of Moroccan companies and their ability to meet the <lb/>requirements imposed by the digitalization movement in the economic and <lb/>social environment. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative research <lb/>approach using the single case study method (Yin, 2018) will be adopted, <lb/>with data collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using <lb/>NVIVO software. <lb/>This article begins with a conceptual analysis to define the main <lb/>components of our research question and to identify the key characteristics <lb/>of IT implementation. Subsequently, we will present the theories and <lb/>explanatory models that shed light on the origins of the selected theoretical <lb/>variables. The resource-based view (RBV) (Barney, 2000) and the theory of <lb/>contingency (Reinking, 2012) will be utilized to identify the complementary <lb/>organizational and human resources required for the IT implementation <lb/>process and to examine the impact of contingency factors (e.g., structure, <lb/>strategy, size) on IT implementation. Finally, we will present and discuss the <lb/>results achieved in this study. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. <lb/>Conceptual Analysis: Literature Review <lb/>The debate about IT has been focused, in the literature of management <lb/>sciences and information systems, on numerous dimensions including that of <lb/>their implementation is, often, considered as a major determinant of their <lb/>performance. For that, we will present, in the following, a conceptual <lb/>analysis in order to identify their different associated visions, their <lb/>typologies, the steps of the process of their implementations and their <lb/>different uses. <lb/>2.1 <lb/>The Various Perspectives of IT <lb/>The literature extensively analyzes five different perspectives on IT. <lb/>These include the tool perspective, the procurement perspective, the holistic <lb/>perspective, the technological perspective, and the nominal perspective. The <lb/>tool perspective, which originated from Kling&apos;s work in 2007, views IT as a <lb/>collection of communication tools with specific characteristics (George et <lb/>al., 1990). The procurement perspective, on the other hand, conceptualizes IT <lb/>based on how users perceive it, its level of implementation within the <lb/>organization, and the monetary value attributed to it as an investment in <lb/>companies (Kohli &amp; Grover, 2008). <lb/>The overall vision perceives IT as a comprehensive package that <lb/>includes all necessary components for socio-economic use, such as training, <lb/>qualified personnel, and support services (Kling, 2007). However, IT vision <lb/>followers limit their focus to the technical capabilities of IT, such as <lb/>information handling, storage, recovery, and transmission (Melville et al., <lb/>2004). On the other hand, the nominal vision of IT completely disregards the <lb/>role of technologies, treating it as a mere empty concept mentioned in <lb/>phenomena like IT governance mechanisms and information system strategy <lb/>or planning (Wanda et al., 2001). These five conceptions related to IT are <lb/>presented by Orlikowski and Lacono (2001) in the following manner: <lb/>-Tool vision: IT is seen as a tool that aims to generate value, whether <lb/>it be through improved productivity, cost reduction, competitive advantage, <lb/>or better relations with suppliers. The intention behind IT use is often <lb/>unclear. <lb/>-Procuration vision: IT is implemented through various agents, <lb/>similar to actions labeled in dollars. There are numerous potential agents, but <lb/>only a few are actually adopted. The adoption of multiple agents allows for <lb/>triangulation and enhances accumulated knowledge. <lb/>-Overall vision: This involves evaluating the value generation of IT in <lb/>rich contexts within the field of IT science, often through case studies or <lb/>field studies focused on organizational structure and co-innovation. <lb/></body>

			<body>-Nominal vision: IT is not effectively conceptualized, appearing in <lb/>name only without significant impact. The focus on abstraction leads to <lb/>precise modelling at the expense of generality. <lb/>The computational vision, which pertains to searching for value <lb/>specifically for IT companies, was not considered by Orlikowski and Lacono <lb/>(2001). <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Typology of IT <lb/>IT encompasses a wide range of software platforms and databases <lb/>that provide various information and communication products. Its main <lb/>objective is to ensure coordination between information systems and internal <lb/>and external users (Bhatt &amp; Grover, 2005; Stoel &amp; Muhanna, 2009). In new <lb/>organizations, IT plays a significant role and is often considered equivalent <lb/>to the concept of an information system (IS). One popular classification of <lb/>IT, as presented by Brousseau et al. (1997) is based on organizational <lb/>properties rather than technical criteria. This typology includes the following <lb/>categories: <lb/>-Telecommunications tools: These tools are used for direct <lb/>interindividual communication. They facilitate communication in a natural <lb/>language such as phone calls, fax, and email. <lb/>-IT tools: These tools serve localized functions, such as collecting, <lb/>processing, and storing information. The operations performed with these <lb/>tools remain within the boundaries of the observed organizational <lb/>component, such as a workstation, service, or firm. <lb/>-Telematic tools: These tools connect IT systems either with each <lb/>other (e.g., exchanging IT documents) or with terminals (e.g., accessing <lb/>databases). Telematic tools are distinct from IT tools as they directly <lb/>contribute to the coordination mechanisms between organizational <lb/>components. They help automate procedures and differ from <lb/>telecommunications tools, as the latter do not involve formalization of <lb/>communication content or coordination procedures. <lb/>2.3 <lb/>The implementation process of IT <lb/>The implementation process of IT, as described by the famous model <lb/>of Kwon and Zmud (1987), is based on the Lewin change model (1952) (to <lb/>manage the changes due to readjustments and reorganizations of companies <lb/>often confronted by resistance from employees, the German-American <lb/>psychologist Kurt Lewin developed a model in 1952 for describing the <lb/>change in three steps: Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze). The process consists of <lb/>five stages: <lb/>-Initiation: This stage starts with the emergence of organizational <lb/>needs for technological innovation. The implementation of IT begins with a <lb/></body>

			<body>diagnosis of the potential gains and latent losses that may come with the <lb/>introduction of the technology. The proposed IT solutions should correspond <lb/>with the tasks for which they are being introduced. <lb/>-Adoption: The adoption stage involves a negotiation process for the <lb/>integration of IT solutions into the organization. It requires an investment <lb/>decision in the IT artefact. <lb/>-Adaptation: Once IT applications are adopted and installed, the <lb/>organization should aim for harmonization between the new technology and <lb/>existing organizational procedures. This can be achieved through proper <lb/>training and information dissemination to potential users. <lb/>-Acceptance: The acceptance stage is crucial in the implementation <lb/>process, as it reflects the success of IT introduction through widespread use <lb/>in the organizational working environment. <lb/>-Routinization: In this final stage, the implementation of IT solutions <lb/>becomes a normal part of users&apos; perception and they become familiar with <lb/>the introduced applications. <lb/>3. <lb/>Nature of Use of IT <lb/>Information technologies are designed to meet the various needs of <lb/>real and potential users, particularly with the advent of the Internet. In <lb/>addition to the internal and external, as well as operational and strategic uses <lb/>of IT, Aral and Weill (2007) have identified four specific types of IT use: <lb/>-Infrastructure use: In this case, IT serves as the foundation for <lb/>shared IT services, providing a flexible base for future commercial <lb/>initiatives. <lb/>-Transactional use: IT enables process automation and contributes to <lb/>cost reduction. <lb/>-Information use: IT provides information for management, <lb/>accounting, reporting, decision-making, planning, control, analysis, and data <lb/>collection. <lb/>-Strategic use: IT facilitates entry into a new market by offering new <lb/>services or activating new products. <lb/>4. <lb/>Theoretical Framework <lb/>Through an examination of the literature in management sciences, <lb/>various theories and explanatory models have been identified as the <lb/>theoretical framework for different issues related to IT implementation. <lb/>Among these theories, two fundamental ones are the resources-based view <lb/>(RBV) (Barney, 2000) and the theory of contingency (Reinking, 2012). <lb/></body>

			<body>4.1 <lb/>Complementarity of Resources and IT Implementation <lb/>The resource-based view (RBV) is widely used in management <lb/>sciences, as explored by Barney (2000), Conner (1991), and Schulze (1992). <lb/>This theory suggests that companies compete based on unique, valuable, <lb/>rare, difficult to imitate, and non-substitutable resources. IT is considered <lb/>one of the resources that companies seek to acquire and develop in order to <lb/>improve performance in a digitally-driven environment. Various <lb/>classifications of IT resources exist, such as Bharadwaj&apos;s (2000) <lb/>classification of IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and intangible assets <lb/>activated by IT, as well as Ross et al.&apos;s (1998) classification of human assets, <lb/>technological assets, and relational assets that contribute to value creation <lb/>(Wade &amp; Hulland, 2004). Other categories of IT resources identified in the <lb/>literature include: <lb/>-Resources for managing external relationships, such as stakeholder <lb/>management, contract monitoring, and coordination of buyers and suppliers. <lb/>-IT resources for market reactivity, including agility, fast delivery, and <lb/>organizational flexibility. <lb/>-IT resources for internal relationships (IS/company partnership), such <lb/>as aligned IT planning, IT/business synergy, and integration of IT into the <lb/>overall strategy. <lb/>-IT resources for IS planning and change management, encompassing <lb/>problem-solving orientation, IT change management, and architecture <lb/>planning. <lb/>-IS infrastructure, including physical and flexible infrastructure and <lb/>technological assets. <lb/>-Technical competencies in IS, such as knowledge and technical assets <lb/>in IT science. <lb/>-IS development based on technical innovation and experimentation <lb/>with new technologies. <lb/>-Profitable operations, including support for operations, IT operations, <lb/>and operations focused on improving product quality. <lb/>The concept of IT resources encompasses IT capacities as well. <lb/>Willcocks et al., (2006) distinguish nine categories, which are business and <lb/>IT vision (integration between IT and other facets of the company), the <lb/>design of IT architectures (competencies in IT development), the provision <lb/>of IT services (implementation, relationships with suppliers and customers), <lb/>and a set of key features including IT leadership and informed procurement. <lb/>Bharadwaj et al., (2013) have identified six dimensions of companies&apos; IT <lb/>capacity: IT/Enterprise partnership, external IT links, reflection on business <lb/>IT strategies, IT business integration, IT management, and IT infrastructure <lb/>(Wade &amp; Hulland, 2004). <lb/></body>

			<body>The idea of complementarity surrounding IT resources has been <lb/>recognized as a mediating variable in various studies and by proponents of <lb/>the resources-based view. Alavi and Leidner (2001) ; Zhu (2004) believe that <lb/>complementarity surrounding IT resources is crucial as it implies a more <lb/>intricate role of IT within the company. These resources play an <lb/>interdependent role with other resources of the company in order to develop <lb/>and sustain a competitive advantage (Bhatt &amp; Grover, 2005). The conclusion <lb/>is that IT can only create competitive value if they are utilized to leverage <lb/>existing business and human resources (Wasko et al., 2011). <lb/>Based on the above, we consider the IT solutions acquired or <lb/>developed by companies as an explanatory variable for the implementation <lb/>of IT. This variable encompasses the IT infrastructure described by Wade and <lb/>Hulland (2004). It includes the nature of IT, the brand of the adopted <lb/>solution, and the mode of adoption. Additionally, we include human <lb/>resources as complementary human-informatics resources, which are part of <lb/>the IT resource for IS planning and change management, as proposed by <lb/>Wade and Hulland (2004). This competence encompasses both the business <lb/>and IT skills of managers and employees who use IT. <lb/>4.2 <lb/>The Impact of Contextual Factors: Contingency Theory <lb/>Contingency theory is a theory that seeks to understand the <lb/>relationships within and between organizational subsystems, as well as <lb/>between the organization as a whole and its environments, and how <lb/>organizations function under different conditions. The most commonly <lb/>recognized contingency factors, as described in the literature, include <lb/>strategy, structure, size, environment, and technology (Donaldson, 2006). <lb/>The use of contingency theory in the field of information and management <lb/>systems has seen significant development in recent decades. The theory <lb/>posits that contingency factors can influence the performance of information <lb/>systems. Weill and Olson (1989) suggest a connection between the <lb/>performance of the information system and that of the organization. <lb/>In the management of information systems, the contingency variables <lb/>typically identified in the literature include strategy, structure, size, <lb/>environment, technology, task, and individual characteristics. In this study, <lb/>three contingency factors -structure, size, and strategy -will be considered <lb/>as they impact the IT implementation process as a dependent variable. <lb/>Structure has been discussed as a contingency variable in the works of Davis <lb/>(1986) ; Ein-Dor (1978); Weill and Olson,(1989). Additionally, (Weill &amp; <lb/>Olson, 1989) analyzed the alignment between organizational structure and <lb/>the structure of the &quot;IT services&quot; function (ISM: Information Systems <lb/>Management). Size has been consistently identified in empirical studies as a <lb/>moderating contingency variable. Klatzky (1970) argues that size is the <lb/></body>

			<body>cause of the decentralized structures that accompany automation. The <lb/>strategy is also considered a contingency variable by Vitale et al., (1986), <lb/>who examined the incorporation of information assets and opportunities into <lb/>the company&apos;s strategic planning process. <lb/>5. <lb/>Methodology And Sample <lb/>In this qualitative study, we utilized a research methodology based on <lb/>the single case study approach (Yin, 2018). Also known as a critical case <lb/>study, this method allows for the examination of one or more analysis unit. <lb/>Researchers often choose this approach when the case represents a critical <lb/>test of existing theory, when it involves a rare or unique event, or when it <lb/>aligns with specific research goals (Verner &amp; Abdullah, 2012). <lb/>Among the various data collection techniques offered by the case <lb/>study method, we opted for semi-structured interviews. To facilitate this, we <lb/>developed an interview guide based on the findings from the theoretical <lb/>framework developed earlier. The questions in the interview guide can be <lb/>summarized into three categories: <lb/>Question 1: What are the factors that influence the pre-<lb/>implementation of IT in Moroccan companies? <lb/>Question 2: What challenges are encountered throughout the IT <lb/>implementation process? <lb/>Question 3: What factors contribute to the success of IT <lb/>implementation in Moroccan companies? <lb/>The data collected will be analyzed and processed using NVIVO <lb/>software, a widely-used tool for qualitative studies. This software provides <lb/>us with multiple tools and functionalities for data presentation, including <lb/>verbatim, correlation matrices, and node clusters. The node clusters will be <lb/>presented along with the Pearson correlation coefficient to indicate the <lb/>degree of correlation between variables that may emerge during the <lb/>empirical investigation. <lb/>The selected company is internationally renowned and a leader in the <lb/>field of mining extraction. From this company, we selected a sample of 15 <lb/>function managers with various roles, including the directorate of <lb/>information systems (DIS) who holds a crucial position. The sample was <lb/>chosen following the methodological recommendations for the case study <lb/>method (Yin, 2018), particularly considering the criteria of ease of access <lb/>and availability. The number of individuals in the sample was determined <lb/>based on the recommended saturation point in qualitative research (Patton, <lb/>2005). The table below illustrates the key characteristics of the sample. <lb/></body>

			<body>to be explored. This section will first identify the pre-implementation factors <lb/>of IT based on interviews with individuals, specifically the managers of the <lb/>information systems department. Following that, the difficulties observed <lb/>during the IT implementation will be presented, both from the perspective of <lb/>the information systems department and other managers. Lastly, the variables <lb/>that contribute to a successful IT implementation in Moroccan companies <lb/>will be identified. <lb/>6.1 <lb/>Pre-implementation of IT in Moroccan Companies <lb/>The success of a company&apos;s digital transformation largely depends on <lb/>the pre-implementation phase. This is a phase where all the necessary studies <lb/>are conducted before adopting IT solutions, including studying IT needs, <lb/>assessing the available material and human capacities and competencies, <lb/>evaluating the internal control system, and studying the IT market to select <lb/>the appropriate solutions and developers to contact. <lb/>6.1.1. IT Needs Study <lb/>Determining the needs requires the involvement of all staff members, <lb/>particularly the managers. Managers are asked to communicate their needs to <lb/>the department responsible for addressing them, providing details about their <lb/>department or service&apos;s size, stakeholders involved, nature of operations, and <lb/>anticipated changes. In the company being studied, the determination of <lb/>needs is described by IT managers answering the following question: <lb/>Question: &quot;How do you determine the IT needs and what factors <lb/>determine these needs?&quot; <lb/>Answer: &quot;Our department determines the IT needs based on requests <lb/>from business managers and evaluating the offerings in the IT market to <lb/>update our IT capabilities. Several factors influence this assessment, <lb/>including the budget provided by general management, the size of our <lb/>business, and the expertise of the developer in question.&quot; <lb/>As a result, it is evident that this phase holds great significance for all <lb/>stakeholders involved in the IT implementation process. It serves as the <lb/>foundation for the subsequent stages and marks the beginning of the <lb/>deployment of IT strategies in alignment with the overall company strategy. <lb/>6.1.2. Evaluation of the Internal Control System <lb/>Another important but often overlooked phase in IT implementation <lb/>is the evaluation of the internal control system. Based on interviews <lb/>conducted, it is apparent that the internal control system requires evaluation <lb/>in order to align with the prevailing quality and management standards <lb/>(Dewett &amp; Jones, 2001). This evaluation enables necessary adjustments to be <lb/>made, ensuring a well-founded implementation of IT (Wahyoedi et al. 2023). <lb/></body>

            <note place="footnote">www.esipreprints.org <lb/></note>

			<page>209 <lb/></page>

			<body>It is worth noting that in our study, we observed the tendency to marginalize <lb/>this evaluation phase of the internal control system. Managers&apos; statements <lb/>revealed the challenges encountered during this stage, such as difficulties <lb/>related to the company&apos;s size and the rigid structure. The company&apos;s size <lb/>poses difficulties in modifying the internal control mechanism, and the rigid <lb/>structure means any modification will affect the established strategies. <lb/>Consequently, we posed the following question to the DIS managers <lb/>regarding this phase: <lb/>Question: &quot;Do you conduct an evaluation of procedures and <lb/>processes before implementing IT? If so, how do you carry out this <lb/>operation?&quot; <lb/>Answer: &quot;Conducting an evaluation of procedures and processes is a <lb/>crucial step before implementing any IT system. This evaluation is essential <lb/>to establish new information flows using IT. However, this operation requires <lb/>significant resources, both human and material. As a result, the evaluation <lb/>stage is only incorporated when there is a complete replacement of the <lb/>initially adopted information system. In other words, we evaluate internal <lb/>control devices when implementing a new solution that includes the majority <lb/>of business processes. On the other hand, when implementing a solution that <lb/>is limited to a certain number of services or departments, this stage is <lb/>marginalized.&quot; <lb/>7. Choice of IT to Adopt <lb/>The choice of IT to be adopted depends on several variables, including <lb/>the type, brand, quality of the developer, and cost. These variables guide the <lb/>decision-making process for implementing IT solutions whether they are <lb/>acquired from the IT market or developed internally. The examination of <lb/>variables that influence the chosen company&apos;s IT solution choices has <lb/>revealed the following correlations: <lb/>Cluster no. 1-Correlation of IT choice with type and brand <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s presentation <lb/>Based on the analysis, we have observed a strong correlation <lb/>(0.631234) between the type and brand of IT solutions that the company <lb/>acquires. This is primarily due to the company&apos;s IT strategy, which focuses <lb/>on obtaining integrated ERP solutions. The preferred brand in the IT market, <lb/>according to interviews with managers, is SAP (Monk &amp; Wagner, 2013). On <lb/></body>

			<body>the other hand, the company only invests in developing specific solutions <lb/>because of its large size and the extensive time required for developing <lb/>integrated ERP solutions. <lb/>Cluster no. 2-Correlation of the choice of IT with the quality of the developer <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s presentation <lb/>The quality of the developer is a crucial factor that IT managers take <lb/>into consideration. This is evident in the correlation between IT acquisition <lb/>and the search for high-quality developers <lb/>(0.658329). This <lb/>relationship is reinforced by the connection between the brand of IT <lb/>solutions and the quality of the developer. <lb/>Cluster no. 3-Correlation of the choice of IT with the cost <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s presentation <lb/>The cost variable remains highly correlated with the choice of IT, as <lb/>widely discussed in the literature. In the selected company, there is an <lb/>average correlation (0.390451) between IT choice and cost. This can be <lb/>attributed to strategic guidelines that prioritize the cost/quality ratio when <lb/>making IT decisions. <lb/>8. Monitoring IT Use <lb/>After implementing the chosen IT solutions, the process does not end <lb/>there. It extends to the use of the adopted IT solutions. The objective of this <lb/>phase is to evaluate the effectiveness of the IT solutions by ensuring their <lb/>efficiency. In this context, the service will take certain actions during this <lb/>phase to address the following question: <lb/>Question: &quot;After implementing IT solutions, what actions do you take <lb/>to monitor and control the functionality and efficiency of these solutions?&quot; <lb/>Answer: &quot;The monitoring phase is one of the most critical phases in <lb/>the IT implementation process. During this phase, we engage all service staff <lb/>to intervene and collaborate with all relevant services and units. This <lb/>includes organizing training sessions on the use of new IT solutions, as well <lb/>as addressing any user problems that arise.&quot; <lb/>From the above, it is evident that the steps mentioned align closely with <lb/>those presented by Kwon and Zmud (1987) in their IT implementation <lb/></body>

Finally, the <lb/>acceptance and routinization phase of the Kwon and Zmud model (1987) <lb/>corresponds to the monitoring of IT use. <lb/>8.1 <lb/>The Challenges of IT Implementation <lb/>The implementation process of IT in Moroccan companies faces <lb/>various difficulties that often impact the objectives of the IT strategy and the <lb/>digital transformation of these businesses. The obtained results allowed us to <lb/>explore the challenges that arise in terms of the IT strategies adopted by the <lb/>company, as well as the cooperation of users. According to statements made <lb/>by managers, the alignment of IT strategies is often achieved by excluding <lb/>operational managers and relying solely on top-down decisions. This <lb/>situation leads to a lack of alignment between business needs and the <lb/>solutions imposed by top management.

This situation often results in the <lb/>presence of implemented but unused solutions, as well as partially utilized <lb/>solutions. <lb/>Our analysis of the relationship between IT user cooperation and IT <lb/>implementation has yielded the following findings: <lb/>Cluster no. 5-Correlation between IT strategy alignment and user cooperation <lb/>Source: Author&apos;s presentation <lb/>This finding emphasizes the importance of cooperation among all <lb/>participants in the IT implementation process. Cooperation can take various <lb/>forms and greatly contributes to the success of the implementation process. <lb/>This includes providing information services related to IT solution <lb/>implementation, understanding their needs, the IT capabilities of their teams, <lb/>and their feedback on IS service choices. <lb/>8.2. Determinants of IT Implementation in Moroccan Companies <lb/>Based on the above findings and the statements of our sample <lb/>managers, we can conclude that IT implementation is dependent on three <lb/>variables: pre-implementation, IT strategy alignment, and user involvement <lb/>(cooperation). In this context, we have identified the determinants of <lb/>successful implementation based on the aforementioned results and manager <lb/>declarations.

			<body>Based on the results obtained, we can identify the main determinants <lb/>of successful IT implementation. These include pre-implementation <lb/>components, alignment of the IT strategy, and variables explaining <lb/>stakeholder cooperation in the implementation process. These determinants <lb/>are present throughout the implementation process and complement each <lb/>other, ensuring the success of IT solution implementation. Therefore, we can <lb/>consider the complementarity between these determinants as a mediating <lb/>variable between the resources available to Moroccan companies <lb/>(independent variables) and IT implementation (dependent variable). <lb/>9. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The results we obtained revealed the numerous challenges that <lb/>impact the implementation of IT in Moroccan companies, posing obstacles to <lb/>their successful digital transformation. This situation raises concerns about <lb/>the ability of Moroccan companies to derive value from their investments in <lb/>IT and their capacity to adapt to digitalization requirements. According to <lb/>proponents of resource theory, IT can provide a lasting and irreplaceable <lb/>competitive advantage when used in conjunction with other complementary <lb/>organizational and human resources (Barney, 2000). <lb/>The presence of resource complementarity is a crucial factor during <lb/>the IT implementation process, serving as a determinant of success. Without <lb/>it, companies face significant challenges. Complementarity is sought <lb/>throughout all stages of the IT implementation process. Based on the <lb/>aforementioned results and interviews with managers, we will now present <lb/>the characteristics of complementarity between IT and other organizational <lb/>and human resources mobilized during the implementation of IT, as follows: <lb/>-During the pre-implementation phase of IT, we observed that <lb/>companies primarily mobilize human resources. These include service staff, <lb/>as well as staff from other departments and functions. The complementarity <lb/>between these two categories of stakeholders is evident in the study of needs <lb/>and the evaluation of the internal control system. In this case, <lb/>complementarity is achieved through cooperation and the exchange of <lb/>information between the two categories involved. <lb/>-During the phase of selecting IT solutions, we found that companies <lb/>mobilize financial resources, in addition to the human resources from the IT <lb/>department, when acquiring IT solutions. This is done through aligning IT <lb/>choices with contextual factors such as business size, structure, and strategy <lb/>(Reinking, 2012). The success of this choice depends on the <lb/>complementarity between these two categories of resources, following a <lb/>rational decision-making process that considers the price/quality ratio. In <lb/>terms of developing IT solutions within the IS service, complementarity is <lb/>achieved through cooperation between IS service personnel and future users, <lb/></body>

			<body>as well as through the harmonization of organizational resources with the <lb/>objectives of the solutions being developed. <lb/>-Finally, the critical phase in the implementation of IT solutions is the <lb/>beginning of their actual use, which often presents various complaints and <lb/>anomalies. This phase strongly calls for complementarity, particularly <lb/>through cooperation and coordination between users and the IS service. <lb/>Communication and information exchange are essential to align the IT <lb/>strategy with the operational objectives of the company. <lb/>From the above, it is evident that complementarity, both between IT <lb/>resources and between IT human resources and other human resources, <lb/>serves as a mediating variable in the success of IT implementation in <lb/>Moroccan companies. This applies to both acquired IT solutions and <lb/>internally developed ones. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The digital transformation of Moroccan companies is no longer a <lb/>choice; it is an obligation imposed by the digitalization movements in their <lb/>economic and social environment. In order to support this transition, <lb/>Moroccan companies are seeking IT solutions that can integrate with their <lb/>structures to meet digitalization requirements. The literature in information <lb/>systems management has been providing theoretical guidance for <lb/>professionals to succeed in the digital transformation of their entities. <lb/>However, there is a limited number of works in this area, which motivated <lb/>our study to explore the determinants of successful implementation of IT <lb/>investments for Moroccan companies. <lb/>To carry out this study, we conducted empirical research at a <lb/>Moroccan company with a highly developed IT structure in the region. The <lb/>main results identified three elements that determine successful <lb/>implementation: pre-implementation factors, alignment of IT strategy, and <lb/>cooperation and coordination among stakeholders. Additionally, we explored <lb/>the mediating variable of complementarity between these determinants, <lb/>which played a role in the IT choices before implementation, alignment of IT <lb/>strategies with the company&apos;s overall strategy, and cooperation and <lb/>coordination among those involved in the implementation process. <lb/>Despite the limitations of this study, such as difficulties in sample <lb/>access and availability of interviewees, these results provide clarity to <lb/>professionals and managers regarding the factors necessary for successful <lb/>digital transformation, particularly during the implementation phase. This <lb/>study also contributes to the literature on information systems management <lb/>and management science by studying the specificities of the Moroccan <lb/>context. Furthermore, it opens up opportunities for future research, including <lb/></body>
