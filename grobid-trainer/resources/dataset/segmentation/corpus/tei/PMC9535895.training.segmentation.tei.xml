Targeting <lb/>aggregation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) is considered a promising approach for the therapeutic treatment of the disease. Peptide <lb/>based inhibitors of β-amyloid fibrillation are emerging as safe drug candidates as well as interesting compounds for early diagnosis of <lb/>AD. Peptide conjugation via covalent bond with functional moieties enables the resultant hybrid system to acquire desired functions. <lb/>Here we report the synthesis, the structural characterization, and the Aβ 42 interaction of a p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative bearing a <lb/>GPGKLVFF peptide pendant at the lower rim. We demonstrate that the p-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conjugate alters the <lb/>Aβ 42 aggregation pathways by preventing Aβ 42 &apos;s conformational transition from random coil to β-sheet with concomitant changes of <lb/>the aggregation kinetic profile as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD), thioflavin T (ThT), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) <lb/>measurements, respectively. High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) confirmed a direct interaction of the p-amino-<lb/>calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conjugate with Aβ 42 monomer which provided insight into a possible working mechanism, whereas the <lb/>alteration of the Aβ 42 &apos;s fibrillary architecture, by the calix-peptide conjugate, was further validated by atomic force microscopy <lb/>(AFM) imaging.

			<body>■ INTRODUCTION <lb/>Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) is associated with a progressively <lb/>neurodegenerative condition leading to dementia that mostly <lb/>affects older people. AD represents one of the &quot;protein <lb/>misfolding diseases&quot; with the highest socioeconomic impact 1 <lb/>and still denotes a serious threat and an important challenge <lb/>for scientific research in both the therapeutic and diagnostic <lb/>fields. The cause and progression of the disease are not yet <lb/>fully elucidated, being AD, especially the sporadic, late onset <lb/>form of the disease (LOAD), linked to genetic or environ-<lb/>mental risk factors, many of which are not still completely <lb/>clarified. 2 Currently, the therapeutic treatments, available in <lb/>the market, offer only small symptomatic benefits and in part <lb/>can slow down the course of the disease. One of the <lb/>pathological hallmarks of AD is the presence of extracellular <lb/></body>

			<body>plaques mainly composed of aggregated forms of amyloid-β <lb/>(Aβ) peptide, a 39-43 residue fragment derived from the <lb/>amyloid precursor protein (APP). 3 Recent studies demonstrate <lb/>that early stage prefibrillar aggregates such as oligomers and <lb/>protofibrils are highly toxic species in the central nervous <lb/>system compared to mature fibrils. 4,5 Structural information <lb/>about the toxic oligomeric Aβ species underlying AD has been <lb/>difficult to obtain at an atomic level. 6 The transient and <lb/>heterogeneous properties of these assemblies imposes many <lb/>challenges for the understanding of the multiple toxic <lb/>mechanisms. Some oligomers are proposed to impart their <lb/>toxic function by interacting directly with the cell membrane of <lb/>neurons with consequent permeabilization and disruption. 7,8 <lb/>Thus, unveiling the structural features of oligomeric Aβ species <lb/>is turning a topical field of investigation propaedeutic for the <lb/>design of effective therapeutics that target these pathogenic Aβ <lb/>species. 9,10 Aβ 42 aggregates into 6-10 nm diameter fibrils with <lb/>the characteristic cross-β structure. 3 Preventing Aβ 42 peptide <lb/>aggregation is therapeutically attractive, since Aβ aggregation is <lb/>an exclusively pathological process. 11 Selective targeting of <lb/>Aβ&apos;s fibrillogenesis should not interfere with the physiological <lb/>function of APP as well as other proteins involved in the <lb/>production of Aβ monomers, whose physiological beneficial <lb/>role has been recently reported. 12 Several small molecules, <lb/>metal chelators, carbohydrate-containing compounds, and <lb/>short peptides have been identified as inhibitors of amyloid <lb/>aggregation. 13-16 In particular, the clinical evidence of an <lb/>abnormal metal ion interaction with Aβ in AD has promoted <lb/>studies aimed at developing potential therapeutic strategies by <lb/>using metal chelators or antioxidant compounds that target <lb/>aberrant metal distribution and the adverse consequences of <lb/>metal induced oxidative stress in AD. 17-19 The finding that the <lb/>hydrophobic core at residues 16-20 of Aβ (KLVFF) is crucial <lb/>for the formation of β-sheet structures 20 has stimulated the <lb/>investigation of the KLVFF peptide as an inhibitor of Aβ 42 <lb/>fibrillogenesis. 21 Some papers in the past reported that the <lb/>KLVFF peptide, by binding the homologous sequence in full-<lb/>length Aβ, can prevent at aggregation into fibrils 13,22,23 and this <lb/>ability is maintained after conjugation to different scaffolds <lb/>including oligolysines, 24 cyclodextrins, 25 dendrimers, 26 or <lb/>porphyrins. 27,28 <lb/>Therefore, conjugation has emerged as a popular mechanism <lb/>to modify or enhance the properties of a peptide drug <lb/>candidate. 29,30 Conjugation can also be used to deliver a <lb/>cytotoxic payload or imaging agent to specific cell types <lb/>targeted by the peptide. 31 Calix[n]arenes are macrocyclic <lb/>polyphenols proposed as molecular scaffolds for different fields <lb/>of application. 32 These macrocycles due to the peculiar <lb/>structure and synthetic versatility have gained great interest <lb/>in supramolecular chemistry. The calix[4-8]arene oligomers <lb/>possess a hydrophobic cavity able to host a variety of guests <lb/>and can cluster and spatially organize multiple ligands, <lb/>providing rigid or flexible constructs suited for molecular <lb/>recognition events. The low toxicity and immunogenicity <lb/>exhibited by a variety of calix[n]arene derivatives have <lb/>advanced these macrocycles to applications in biomedical <lb/>and pharmaceutical fields. 33 Calix[n]arene derivatives have <lb/>been proposed as anticancer, 34 antibacterial, 35 synthetic <lb/>vaccines, 36 imaging agents, 37 and drug 38 and gene 39 delivery <lb/>systems. Opportunely functionalized, the calix[n]arenes have <lb/>also been exploited as biomimetic models to better understand <lb/>relevant biological processes underlying the protein-protein or <lb/>protein-carbohydrate interactions. 40 Yet, calix[n]arenes have <lb/>been successfully used as novel compounds for protein <lb/>detection 40 and protein modulation. 41 However, despite the <lb/>wide use of calix[n]arenes in several fields of application, very <lb/>few papers have dealt with the interactions of calix[n]arene <lb/>derivatives with Aβ. Wang et al. described p-sulfonate-<lb/>calix[4,6,8]arenes with anti-and disaggregating effect on <lb/>Aβ 42 through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. 42 Guo et <lb/>al. synthesized a nanoassembly consisting of multiple units of a <lb/>p-sulfonate calix[4]arene and a β-cyclodextrin, which by means <lb/>of the multiple complexing cavities exposed on the nano-<lb/>assembly surface bind Aβ 42 , inhibiting its aggregation or <lb/>inducing fibril disaggregation. 43 We determined that endowing <lb/>the calixarene macrocycle with an Aβ recognition motif would <lb/>generate a more refined tool to contrast the detrimental effects <lb/>of the aggregated forms of Aβ peptides. Thus, we resorted to <lb/>the design and synthesis of a new calix[4]arene-peptide <lb/>conjugate composed of a p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative <lb/>bearing a GPGKLVFF peptide sequence at the macrocycle <lb/>lower rim. We describe herein the synthesis and structural <lb/>characterization of this hybrid system, alongside its capability <lb/>to hamper Aβ 42 aggregation in vitro. The study has been <lb/>carried out using a variety of spectroscopic techniques <lb/>including circular dichroism (CD), thioflavin T (ThT) <lb/>fluorescence, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic <lb/>force microscopy (AFM) imaging. High resolution mass <lb/>spectrometry (HR-MS) was employed to point out direct <lb/>interaction of the p-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conju-<lb/>gate with the Aβ 42 monomer. We also aim at providing in vitro <lb/>experimental evidence of the ability of this novel construct to <lb/>prevent the Aβ oligomer cytotoxic effects on differentiated SH-<lb/>SY5Y neuronal cultures. We demonstrate that the calix-<lb/>peptide conjugate is per se nontoxic to neuronal cells and this <lb/>allows its potential use as therapeutic agent in AD. <lb/>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Design and Synthesis of Calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF <lb/>(5). In search of functional calix[n]arene inhibitors of Aβ <lb/>amyloid fibrillogenesis, we thought that joining an Aβ <lb/>recognition peptide moiety to the framework of a water-<lb/>soluble p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative would result in a new <lb/>hybrid construct able to efficiently interact with Aβ peptides <lb/>and therefore hampering peptide chain&apos;s self-assembly into <lb/>oligomeric/fibrillary toxic species. We chose the GPGKLVFF <lb/>sequence because of the established ability of the KLVFF motif <lb/>to recognize the homologous region of the parent full-length <lb/>Aβ peptide. The additional GPG tripeptide was inserted to <lb/>reduce any eventual propensity to self-aggregation of the <lb/>calix-peptide conjugate. The p-amino-calix[4]arene scaffold <lb/>should confer enhanced water solubility to the resultant calix-<lb/>peptide conjugate, at the same time establishing multiple <lb/>noncovalent contacts with the aromatic and anionic amino acid <lb/>residues of the Aβ peptide. Moreover, it is expected that the <lb/>calix-peptide conjugate would generate a steric hindrance <lb/>between adjacent peptide chains thereby disturbing the Aβ&apos;s <lb/>self-assembly process. Compared to other peptide-conjugated <lb/>systems, the peptide-calixarene difunctional compound can <lb/>offer some advantages deriving from the known complexing <lb/>properties of the calixarene cavity, in addition to the <lb/>antiamyloidogenic action of β-sheet breaker pentapeptide <lb/>KLVFF as a &quot;binding element&quot; for targeting Aβ. The calixarene <lb/>moiety might also synergically assist the peptide ligand in both <lb/>Aβ monomer stabilization and protection of neurons from Aβ <lb/>oligomeric insult. The calix-peptide hybrid system might in <lb/></body>

In brief, for the preparation of compound 1 44 the <lb/>starting material p-tert-butyl-calix[4]arene was blocked in a <lb/>cone conformation by tetra-functionalization of its lower rim <lb/>with three propyl groups and one ethyl acetate group. Amino <lb/>groups were introduced at the calix[4]arene upper rim, by <lb/>ipso-nitration followed by C/Pd catalyzed reduction of the <lb/>nitro groups. Before the coupling reaction with the peptide <lb/>fragment, the amino groups at the upper rim were protected by <lb/>tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) groups to give compound 2. <lb/>Hydrolysis reaction provided compound 3 in which the <lb/>COOH group at the lower rim can be used for the linkage of <lb/>the GPGK(Dde)LVFF pendant via amide bond (Dde: N-(1-<lb/>(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl).

Peptide conjugation <lb/>to the calix[4]arene scaffold was accomplished in solution and <lb/>in the presence of PyBop as a condensing agent. The selective <lb/>removal of the Dde and Boc protecting groups, by sequential <lb/>treatment with hydrazine and trifluoroacetic acid respectively, <lb/>gave the compound 5 whose molecular identity was confirmed <lb/>by combined MALDI-TOF-MS, HR-ESI-MS and 1D/2D <lb/>NMR spectra (Supporting Information Figures S2-S10). <lb/>Calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF (5)/Aβ 42 Interactions.

			<body>derivatives on the Aβ 42 &apos;s β-sheet conformational transition. <lb/>Figure 1 shows the CD spectra recorded for Aβ 42 alone and in <lb/>the presence of compound 5. It is clear from Figure 1 that, in <lb/>the absence of 5, the Aβ 42 sample (5 μM) undergoes to an <lb/>almost complete β-sheet conformational transition after 72 h. <lb/>In fact, the freshly prepared Aβ 42 sample displays clear negative <lb/>dichroism below 200 nm that is typical of a randomly coiled <lb/>peptide chain. This curve profile gradually changes toward the <lb/>β-sheet pattern, as the incubation time proceeds. The CD <lb/>spectrum recorded at 72 h incubation time shows positive <lb/>ellipticity at 190 nm along with a negative signal at 218 nm, <lb/>thereby indicating the presence of β-sheet peptide structures. 47 <lb/>This pattern does not change significantly after this time, <lb/>indicating that Aβ 42 almost reaches the final state after 5 days <lb/>of incubation. The CD spectra recorded in the presence of 5, <lb/>either at equimolar or 5 mol excess, never display the <lb/>characteristic β-sheet pattern. More interestingly, the observed <lb/>CD spectra recorded at 5-fold molar excess always exhibit <lb/>strong negative ellipticity at 190 nm along with no apparent <lb/>inflection of the negative band around 218 nm in the <lb/>considered interval of time. 47 The experimental CD curves <lb/>were subjected to deconvolution analysis using the CONTINN <lb/>and CDSSTR algorithms. 48 In Figure 2, the graphical <lb/>representation of the percentage of unordered peptide <lb/>conformation as estimated at t = 0 or t = 120 h is reported. <lb/>The values of the determined random coil secondary structure <lb/>are reported in Table S1. It is apparent that at t = 120 h a <lb/>higher percentage of random coil conformation is maintained <lb/>in the presence of the derivative 5 with respect to Aβ 42 control. <lb/>The CD spectra of the calix-peptide conjugate 5 alone were <lb/>recorded in the same experimental conditions. These spectra <lb/>are characterized by a generalized low CD amplitude that does <lb/>not change with time (Figure S11). All the above indicates that <lb/>5 significantly inhibits the Aβ 42 &apos;s β-sheet conformational <lb/>transition typically associated with the fibrillogenesis process. 46 <lb/>In other words, the CD results suggest that 5 well preserves the <lb/>Aβ randomly coiled monomer from its recruitment into <lb/>potentially toxic aggregates. We wanted also to evaluate the <lb/>ability of the calix[4]arene macrocycle to interfere with the <lb/>random coil/β-sheet conformational transition of Aβ 42 . We <lb/>then acquired a new set of CD measurements, under the same <lb/>experimental conditions as above, on a sample of Aβ 42 and the <lb/>p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative 1 in both 1:1 and 1:5 molar <lb/>ratios. CD data showed that compound 1 is able to interact <lb/>with Aβ 42 (Figure S12), although to a lesser extent than 5. This <lb/>also became evident from the deconvolution analysis (Figure <lb/>2) where the percentage of unordered peptide chain is higher <lb/>than the one of the Aβ 42 control at t = 120 h. The inhibitory <lb/>effect of the unconjugated GPGKLVFF on Aβ&apos;s self-assembly <lb/>process was also evaluated for comparison. As expected, the <lb/>CD data demonstrate the ability of the free peptide to interfere <lb/>with the Aβ aggregation (Figure S13). However, the <lb/>comparison with the effects generated by the synthesized <lb/>conjugate 5 allows us to point out some differences. Unlike the <lb/>case of compound 5, at the 1:1 ratio with Aβ, the unconjugated <lb/>GPGKLVFF peptide is able to accelerate the fibrillogenic <lb/>process. This turns evident in the CD experiments (Figure <lb/>S13). A typical CD profile of the β-sheet conformation was <lb/>observed after 48 h coincubation (Aβ alone reaches the same <lb/>conformation after 72 h). The acceleration of the aggregation <lb/>rate caused massive precipitation, and we were not able to <lb/>acquire CD spectra at 72 h (Figure S13). The CD data <lb/>obtained at a 1:5 ratio indicated that the free GPGKLVFF can <lb/>slow down the aggregation process of Aβ but, in any case, to a <lb/>lesser extent than the one observed in the presence of the <lb/>calix-peptide conjugate at both 1:1 and 1:5 ratios.

			<body>conclusion, the CD study suggests that compounds 1 and free <lb/>GPGKLVFF can affect the Aβ 42 propensity to adopt β-sheet <lb/>conformation. Importantly, the CD experiments clearly <lb/>indicated the superiority of the hybrid system 5 in inhibiting <lb/>Aβ 42 aggregation compared to the separate calix or peptide <lb/>moieties. <lb/>Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assay (ThT). The kinetic of Aβ 42 <lb/>aggregation was also monitored by ThT fluorescence. ThT is a <lb/>fluorophore that enhances its fluorescence intensity upon <lb/>binding to amyloid fibrils. 49 Fluorescence intensity was <lb/>monitored at 482 nm for 67 h and at 37 °C. The results are <lb/>presented in Figure 3. In the absence of inhibitors, Aβ 42 <lb/>displayed a rapid increase of the ThT fluorescence, as expected <lb/>from the inherent propensity to amyloid formation of this <lb/>peptide. It is also evident that the curve profile observed <lb/>displays just a hint of initial nucleation phase (Figure 3, black). <lb/>The prompt formation of aggregated seeds (at t = 0) might be <lb/>the responsible of such behavior. It is assumed that the lower <lb/>fluorescence intensity we observed in the presence of the <lb/>inhibitors at either equimolar ratio or 5-fold molar excess is <lb/>related to a lesser amount of Aβ 42 fibrillary aggregated form. <lb/>The antifibrillogenic activity of the conjugate peptide 5 is <lb/>evident at equimolar ratio (Figure 3, red). Interestingly the <lb/>observed profile displays a clear nucleation phase (lag phase), <lb/>that suggests an effective action of compound 5 in the early <lb/>events of Aβ 42 fibrillogenesis. <lb/>Such an effect becomes even more apparent at 5-fold molar <lb/>excess. As one can see, a very long lag phase, along with a <lb/>negligible increasing of ThT fluorescence intensity, testifies an <lb/>almost complete inhibition of fibril formation (Figure 3, light <lb/>blue). The ThT curves related to the kinetic of the calixarene <lb/>precursor 1 or free GPGKLVFF with Aβ 42 also reveal the <lb/>capability of these compounds to interfere with the Aβ 42 <lb/>fibrillogenic process, although to a lesser extent than <lb/>compound 5. What we observed was a reduction of the <lb/>fluorescence intensity of the curves, but, again, a clear lag phase <lb/>was not observed. The only exception was the ThT curve <lb/>observed at 1:1 ratio for the free GPGKLVFF. It strongly <lb/>activated Aβ fibril generation (Figure 3, green). This <lb/>proaggregating behavior is in keeping with the CD measure-<lb/>ments, and substantial flocculation appeared after 48 h. The <lb/>sample reaches ThT fluorescence max intensity faster than <lb/>Aβ 42 alone. It might be conceivable that the compound may <lb/>somehow self-aggregate and give false positive, but control <lb/>ThT experiments ruled out significant interference occurring <lb/>between ThT and compounds 1, 5 or GPGKLVFF (Figure <lb/>S14). An alternative interpretation implies the ability of free <lb/>GPGKLVFF compound to become an integral part of ThT <lb/>positive heterofibrils with Aβ 50 (Figure 3, pink). The whole of <lb/>the ThT results further confirm that both 1 and 5 exhibit a <lb/>dose responsive antifibrillogenic activity. A quantitative <lb/>analysis of the experimental curves was obtained by proper <lb/>fitting using a suitable equation, and the relevant kinetic <lb/>parameters are reported in the Supporting Information (Table <lb/>S2). <lb/>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). We resorted to DLS <lb/>measurements to determine the average size of the aggregates <lb/>in solution and to monitor their growth over time, either in the <lb/>absence or in the presence of 5. Data were collected at t = 0 <lb/>and 120 h and are shown in Figure 4 as the analysis of the <lb/>number of scattering objects. 51 The analysis indicates that <lb/>Figure 3. Aggregation kinetics detected by in situ ThT fluorescence <lb/>assays of Aβ 42 (20 μM, black) and in the presence of equimolar or 5-<lb/>fold molar excess of compound 1, 5 or GPGKLVFF (Aβ 42 /1 1:1, dark <lb/>blue), (Aβ 42 /11:5, purple), (Aβ 42 /5 1:1, red), (Aβ 42 /5, 1:5 light <lb/>blue), (Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF 1:1, green), (Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF 1:5, pink). <lb/>*The extraction of the kinetic parameters by using the empirical <lb/>equation in the Experimental Section was not possible. <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>small aggregates with an average size of 60 nm are the main <lb/>scattering objects in the freshly prepared Aβ 42 sample (t = 0). <lb/>The end stage of Aβ aggregation was analyzed after 120 h, and <lb/>the formation of larger aggregates was observed. In particular, <lb/>the DLS profile indicated the presence of particles with <lb/>increased diameter values (&gt;100 nm) as the most abundant <lb/>scattering entities, along with a very low percentage of bigger <lb/>aggregates with size in the micrometric range. The data <lb/>collected in the presence of 5 clearly indicated the reduction of <lb/>the dimension of Aβ 42 aggregates both at the initial stage and <lb/>end point of monitoring. In fact, at t = 0, the majority of the <lb/>scattering particles in solution displayed a diameter size of <lb/>around 45 nm (Figure 4), whereas only aggregates as large as <lb/>84 nm were detected after 120 h. It should be said that <lb/>compound 5 alone (5 μM) formed small aggregates with a <lb/>mean hydrodynamic diameter around 8 nm at t = 0. Larger <lb/>aggregates (diameter &gt; 300 nm) were seen at t = 120 h (Figure <lb/>S15). At 20 μM, compound 5 forms nanoaggregates with a <lb/>mean hydrodynamic diameter of 22 nm and ζ potential 50 ± 2 <lb/>mV (Figure S16). <lb/>AFM Analysis. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies <lb/>revealed the morphologies of Aβ 42 aggregates. Figure 5a shows <lb/>that, after 120 h of incubation, Aβ 42 (5 μM) alone formed a <lb/>fibrillary network with an average fibril height of 2.65 ± 0.44 <lb/>nm. The copresence of 5, at the same concentration (5 μM), <lb/>during the Aβ 42 incubation time of 120 h, clearly inhibited the <lb/>development of amyloid fibrils, and only small amorphous <lb/>aggregates are detected with sizes of 4.30 ± 1.33 nm (Figure <lb/>5b). Statistical data for Aβ 42 alone and for copresence of 5 are <lb/>reported in Figure 5c and d, respectively. The AFM images <lb/>further confirmed the ability of 5 to inhibit Aβ 42 fibril <lb/>formation in keeping with the spectroscopic results. <lb/>MS Study of Aβ 42 /5 and Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF Interactions. ESI-<lb/>MS measurements were carried out to verify the formation of <lb/>molecular adducts when GPGKLVFF and the relative <lb/>conjugate 5 were added to the Aβ 42 sample solution. The <lb/>Aβ 42 sample and the 1:5 mixtures of Aβ 42 /5 and Aβ 42 / <lb/>GPGKLVFF, were monomerized using the protocol reported <lb/>in the Experimental Section and lyophilized overnight.

A closer inspection of the ESI-MS spectrum <lb/>revealed a signal at m/z = 1806.52 corresponding to the mass <lb/>of the dimeric peptide in the +5 charge state (Figure 6, inset). <lb/>This signal disappeared in the mass spectra acquired in the <lb/>Aβ 42 /5 sample (Figure S17), whereas m/z signals 1507.79 and <lb/>2010.06 corresponding to the +4 and +3 charge state of Aβ 42 / <lb/>5 adduct were observed. Similar effects were seen in the mass <lb/>spectrum of the Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF sample (Figure S18). Here, <lb/>m/z signals 1345.20 and 1793.27 can be assigned to the [Aβ 42 / <lb/>GPGKLVFF] 4+ and [Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF] 3+ adducts, respec-<lb/>tively, with concomitant loss of the dimeric form of Aβ 42 . <lb/>Despite the mass spectrometric results were deduced from <lb/>the gas-phase system, they nicely support what was observed in <lb/>solution in terms of direct interactions between Aβ 42 and <lb/>GPGKLVFF or 5. Nevertheless, this study reveals that the <lb/>dimeric form of Aβ 42 is no longer detectable in the MS <lb/>spectrum when either GPGKLVFF or 5 is present in the <lb/>sample solution. Such evidence suggests, once more, that these <lb/>interactions occur in the solution phase and may play a role in <lb/>the early events of the Aβ 42 aggregation process. As reported in <lb/>our previous works, 16,27 the identification of proteolysis <lb/>resistant peptides fragments by mass spectrometry may reveal <lb/>the binding region of Aβ 42 to specific molecules. Indeed, <lb/>cleavage of the peptide bonds by a protease is rapid in easily <lb/>accessible unstructured regions of a polypeptide, whereas the <lb/>steric hindrance of other molecules at the cleavage sites should <lb/>affect the rate of hydrolysis. We analyzed the Aβ 42 peptide <lb/>fragments generated after 2 h of trypsin digestion. This enzyme <lb/>selectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at the C-<lb/>terminal side of lysyl and arginyl residues. As a matter of fact, <lb/>the peptide fragments Aβ(1-5), Aβ(6-16), and Aβ(17-28) <lb/>were detected in the ESI-MS spectrum (see Figure S19), <lb/>indicating the cleavages expected occur at positions 5, 16, and <lb/>28 of Aβ 42 . The peptide fragment Aβ(1-16) was also <lb/>observed. It could be related to the conformational features <lb/>of Aβ 42 that affect the accessibility to the Arg-5-His-6 cleavage <lb/>site (Scheme S1). The absence of signals corresponding to <lb/>Aβ 42 suggested that protein digestion by trypsin was totally <lb/>accomplished after 2 h (Figure 7a). Interestingly, the peptide <lb/>fragments Aβ(17-42), Aβ(6-42), and full length Aβ 42 , <lb/>imputable to incomplete Aβ 42 processing, were observed in <lb/>the mass spectra (Figures 7b and 8b, Scheme S2) recorded <lb/>after 2 h of trypsin digestion in the copresence of 5. Similar <lb/>results were observed in mass spectra of Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF <lb/>mixture (data not shown). It is important to note that both <lb/>GPGKLVFF and 5 were also subjected to trypsin degradation <lb/>Figure 6. ESI-MS spectrum of Aβ 42 . The inset in the Figure shows the comparison between the experimental and theoretical isotopic distribution <lb/>of peak corresponding to the Aβ 42 dimer in the +5 charge state. <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>indicating that these peptides do not inhibit enzyme&apos;s activity. <lb/>Therefore, it can be envisioned that the interaction of <lb/>GPGKLVFF or 5 with Aβ 42 affects the processing of the <lb/>amyloid protein by trypsin. Oxidized forms of Aβ and related <lb/>fragments were seen in the MS spectra. Oxidation of peptides <lb/>and proteins during electrospray ionization may occur because <lb/>the generation of ions in ESI source is related to an <lb/>electrochemical process. 52 <lb/>Cytotoxicity Studies. Based on the previous promising <lb/>results, we tested the peptide conjugate 5 for its biological <lb/>activity in order to (i) exclude any potential toxicity to <lb/>neuronal cells and more interestingly (ii) assess its ability to <lb/>prevent oligomers toxicity. For this purpose, we used the <lb/>neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, fully differentiated accord-<lb/>ing to a well-established protocol (see the Experimental <lb/>Section). After prolonged treatments with all-trans-retinoic <lb/>acid (RA) and the consequent acquisition of a <lb/>phenotype, we exposed cells to increasing concentrations of <lb/>compound 5 (0.1, 5, 20, 50 μM) for 24 h (Figure 9). The <lb/>peptides KLVFF and GPGKLVFF were also added as controls. <lb/>As expected, the peptide KLVFF as well as the longer peptide <lb/>containing the tripeptide GPG sequence (GPGKLVFF) <lb/>revealed similar activity to that of control. Interestingly, no <lb/>toxicity was observed for compound 5 at any of the <lb/>concentrations used, with a positive, even if not statistically <lb/>significant, trend between dose (0.1-20 μM) and cellular <lb/>response, after 24 h exposure. Hence, we tested the ability of <lb/>compound 5 to protect neurons from the Aβ 42 oligomer <lb/>cytotoxic insult. Aβ oligomers (oAβs) were obtained from <lb/>freshly prepared solution of Aβ 42 , incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in <lb/>the presence or in the absence of the calixarene-peptide <lb/>conjugate 5. <lb/>Aβ oligomers obtained following the incubation were added <lb/>at the final concentration of 2 μM, alone or in combination <lb/>with all of the compounds at the molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:5. <lb/>Cells, were then exposed for 48 h to each coincubated mixture <lb/>and cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. As shown in <lb/>Figure 10, Aβ oligomers induce a slight but statistically <lb/>significant reduction of cell viability that is clearly prevented in <lb/>the presence of compound 5. We have already reported on the <lb/>antioligomerization activity of a trehalose conjugated LPFFD <lb/>peptide. 53 The newly synthesized compound shows a similar <lb/>interesting effect of the Aβ derived pentapeptide with a better <lb/>trend, making this functionalization even more promising also <lb/>in the light of calix[4]arenes ability to be potentially loaded <lb/>with selected drugs. The biological effect observed on SH-<lb/>SY5Y differentiated cells has been also confirmed by SDS-<lb/>polyacrylamide gel experiments. The same solutions used to <lb/>treat the cells were in fact loaded onto 4-12% gel <lb/>polyacrylamide to assess the amount and size of Aβ 42 <lb/>aggregates formed in the presence of the compound 5 or its <lb/>related controls. Two different concentrations of Aβ 42 have <lb/>been used and each peptide added with a molar ratio of 1:5. <lb/>Results show that, as expected, Aβ alone during 48 h <lb/>incubations at 4 °C was able to give rise to the typical <lb/>migration pattern in which low molecular weight size (LMW: <lb/>monomers, dimers, and tetramers) and high molecular weight <lb/>(HMW: &gt;50 kDa oligomers) size are observed (Figure S20). <lb/>Coincubation with compound 5 strongly decreases the HMW <lb/>band signal, which confirmed that our compound interferes <lb/>with Aβ aggregation. <lb/>■ CONCLUSION <lb/>In the present work, we have described the design, synthesis, <lb/>and biophysical properties of a new calixarene-peptide <lb/>construct that combines the Aβ recognition ability of the <lb/>GPGKLVFF sequence with the host and recognition proper-<lb/>ties of the calixarene macrocycle. This novel compound is able <lb/>to prevent cross-β-sheet elongation of Aβ 42 through a <lb/>synergistic action of both calixarene and peptide moieties <lb/>that can be considered as β-sheet breaker elements. This is an <lb/>interesting example of a small construct being able to preserve <lb/>the nontoxic monomeric species of Aβ 42 from being recruited <lb/>Figure 9. MTT assay was performed on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells <lb/>after 24 h treatments. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations <lb/>of 5 (0.1, 5, 20, 50 μM). Cells were also treated with the same <lb/>concentrations of appropriate controls (KLVFF or GPGKLVFF). Bars <lb/>represent means of three independent experiments with n = 5. <lb/>Figure 10. MTT assay was performed on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells <lb/>after 48 h treatments. Cells were exposed to 2 μM Aβ oligomers <lb/>incubated with or without compound 5 at the molar ratios of 1:1 and <lb/>1:5. Coincubations with KLVFF alone and GPGKLVFF were also <lb/>performed as experimental controls.

			<body>into oligomeric/fibrillar aggregated forms, as demonstrated by <lb/>circular dichroism and ThT fluorescence. The lack of toxicity, <lb/>combined with the significant protective action on neuronal <lb/>cells, further points toward a considerable therapeutic potential <lb/>of this novel construct. Moreover, given the already established <lb/>pharmaceutical functions of calixarenes in drug delivery, our <lb/>findings suggest that the conjugate has great potential as a <lb/>vehicle for the targeted delivery of additional therapeutic <lb/>agents in AD. In fact, due to the presence of calix[4]arene and <lb/>peptide moieties, multiple potential actions can be expected, <lb/>and the possibility that the calixarene cavity offers to host and <lb/>transport a variety of guests, such as drugs or imaging agents, <lb/>opens up interesting perspectives for further investigations in <lb/>diagnosis and therapy for amyloid related diseases. The <lb/>calix[n]arene family offers a variety of macrocyclic scaffolds <lb/>differing in size and structural conformation that, together with <lb/>the versatility and ease of functionalization, may provide an <lb/>additional tool for the development of other peptide-<lb/>calixarene conjugates for Aβ aggregation inhibitors. <lb/>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>Materials and Instrumentation. All the reagents were of <lb/>analytical grade. Calix[4]arene derivative 1 44 and GPGKLVFF <lb/>peptide were prepared according to standard chemical procedures <lb/>reported below. Aβ 42 was obtained from Bachem (Switzerland). <lb/>MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on the SCIEX TOF/TOF 5800 <lb/>instrument. The MALDI-MS spectra were carried out using α-CHCA <lb/>as a matrix with a thin layer deposition method. Lyophilized samples <lb/>(0.1 mg) were dissolved in 100 μL of 1:1:0.01 acetonitrile/water/ <lb/>TFA. Sinapinic acid (SIN) and α-CHCA were prepared by dissolving <lb/>4-8 mg/vial of matrices in 1 mL of 50% acetonitrile in 0.3% TFA and <lb/>1 mL of 30% acetonitrile in 0.3% TFA, respectively. Standard kits <lb/>were used to calibrate the mass scale of the MALDI mass <lb/>spectrometer. The Peptide Mass standard kit includes des-Arg1-<lb/>bradikynin, angiotensin I, Glu1-fibrinopeptide B, ACTH (Clip 1-17), <lb/>ACTH (Clip 18-39), and ACTH (Clip 7-38), and it was used to <lb/>cover a mass range of 800-4000 Da. <lb/>1 H NMR (400.13 MHz), 13 C NMR (100.61 MHz), and 2D NMR <lb/>spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. <lb/>Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm), <lb/>referenced to the residual methanol peak; coupling constant (J) values <lb/>are given in Hz. <lb/>Synthesis of GPGK(Dde)LVFF. The peptide was synthesized using <lb/>the microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis strategy on a <lb/>Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM). The peptide chain assembly was <lb/>carried out on a NovaSyn TGR resin (substitution 0.22 mmol/g) <lb/>using the Fmoc chemistry method. All Fmoc-amino acids were <lb/>introduced according to the TBTU/HOBT/DIEA or COMU <lb/>activation methods. All syntheses were carried out under a 4-fold <lb/>excess of amino acid. Removal of Fmoc protection during synthesis <lb/>was achieved by means of 20% piperidine solution in DMF. The <lb/>following instrumental conditions were used for each coupling cycle: <lb/>microwave power 25 W, reaction temperature 75 °C, coupling time <lb/>300 s. The instrumental conditions used for the deprotection cycles <lb/>were: microwave power 25 W, reaction temperature 75 °C, <lb/>deprotection time 180 s. The peptides were cleaved off from the <lb/>resin using a mixture of TFA/H 2 O/TIS (95:2.5:2.5 v/v/v). Crude <lb/>peptides were recovered by precipitation with freshly distilled diethyl <lb/>ether. The purification of crude GPGK(Dde)LVFF was carried out by <lb/>preparative reversed-phase HPLC using a SHIMADZU LC-20A <lb/>chromatography system equipped with a SPD-M20A photodiode <lb/>diode array detector with detection at 222 and 254 nm. A Kinetex <lb/>C18 250 × 21.10 mm (100 Å pore size, AXIA Packed) column was <lb/>used. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 10 mL/min according <lb/>to the following protocol: from 0 to 5 min isocratic conditions in 95% <lb/>solvent A (H 2 O containing 0.1% TFA) followed by a 20 min linear <lb/>gradient from 5 to 70% B (CH 3 CN containing 0.1% TFA) and then 5 <lb/>min isocratic conditions in 70% B. Fractions containing the desired <lb/>product were collected and lyophilized. Sample identity was <lb/>confirmed by ESI-ORPBITRAP MASS. Calculated mass: 1026.59; <lb/>observed: [M + H] + = 1027.59; [M + 2H] 2+ = 514.30. <lb/>Synthesis of 5,11,17,23-Tetra-Boc-amino-25,26,27-tripropoxy-<lb/>28-(2-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy)-calix[4]arene (2). To compound 1 <lb/>(200 mg, 0.29 mmol) dissolved in passed through basic alumina <lb/>CH 2 Cl 2 (8 mL), di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.33 mL, 1.44 mmol) was <lb/>added. The mixture was stirred at rt overnight, then a 5% aq NaHCO 3 <lb/>solution (50 mL) and CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL) were added. The organic <lb/>phase was washed with 5% aq NaHCO 3 solution (50 mL) and water <lb/>(50 mL × 2). After removal of the solvent under vacuum, the solid <lb/>residue was washed with hexane and recovered by filtration to give <lb/>pure compound 2 (283 mg, 90%). 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 , 297 K) δ: 0.92 <lb/>(t, 3H, J = 7.4 Hz, propyl CH 3 ), 0.98 (t, 6H, J = 7.4 Hz, 2 × propyl <lb/>CH 3 ), 1.26 (t, 3H, J = 7.1 Hz, OCH 2 CH 3 ), 1.46, 1.49, (s, 9H each, <lb/>Boc CH 3 ), 1.56 (s, 18H, 2 × Boc CH 3 ), 1.85 (m, 6H, J = 7.4 Hz, 3 × <lb/>propyl CH 2 CH 3 ), 3.08 and 4.37 (AX system, 4H, J = 13.4 Hz, 2 × <lb/>ArCH 2 Ar), 3.14 and 4.57 (AX system, 4H, J = 13.4 Hz, 2 × <lb/>ArCH 2 Ar), 3.71 (t, 4H, J = 7.4 Hz, 2 × propyl OCH 2 ), 3.80 (t, 2H, J <lb/>= 7.4 Hz, propyl OCH 2 ), 4.17 (q, 2H, J = 7.1 Hz, OCH 2 CH 3 ), 4.64 <lb/>(s, 2H, OCH 2 CO), 6.03 (s, 2H, 2 × ArH), 6.26 (d, 2H, J = 3.4 Hz, 2 <lb/>× ArH), 6.43 (d, 2H, J = 3.4 Hz, 2 × ArH), 6.81 (s, 2H, 2 × ArH). <lb/>Synthesis of 5,11,17,23-Tetra-Boc-amino-25,26,27-tripropoxy-<lb/>28-(carbomethoxy)-calix[4]arene (3). Compound 2 (100 mg, 0.075 <lb/>mmol) was suspended in THF (10 mL) in the presence of water (2 <lb/>mL) and KOH (50 mg, 0.89 mmol). The resulting mixture was <lb/>refluxed and stirred for 3 h. The pH was adjusted to 4 with aq 1 N <lb/>HCl. The product was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 , and the organic layer <lb/>was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated to give pure compound 3 <lb/>(95.37 mg, 98%). 1 H NMR (MeOD, 297 K) δ: 0.91 (t, 3H, J = 7.4 <lb/>Hz, propyl CH 3 ), 1.02 (t, 6H, J = 7.4 Hz, 2 × propyl CH 3 ), 1.42, 1.51, <lb/>(s, 18H each, Boc CH 3 ), 1.88 (m, 6H, J = 7.4 Hz, 3 × propyl <lb/>CH 2 CH 3 ), 3.12 and 4.40 (AX system, 4H, J = 12.7 Hz, 2 × <lb/>ArCH 2 Ar), 3.18 and 4.45 (AX system, 4H, J = 12.7 Hz, 2 × <lb/>ArCH 2 Ar), 3.73 (t, 4H, J = 7.4 Hz, 2 × propyl OCH 2 ), 3.95 (t, 2H, J <lb/>= 7.4 Hz, propyl OCH 2 ), 4.68 (s, 2H, OCH 2 CO), 6.58 (s, 4H, 4 × <lb/>ArH), 7.08 (s, 4H, 4 × ArH). <lb/>Synthesis of p-Boc-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF-Dde Conju-<lb/>gate (4) and Deprotection to p-Amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF <lb/>Conjugate (5).

The mixture was stirred <lb/>for 2 h at room temperature, and then GPGK(Dde)LVFF (20.9 mg, <lb/>0.020 mmol) dissolved in DIPEA (5.6 μL, 0.032 mmol) was added. <lb/>After stirring at room temperature for 18 h, the solvent was removed <lb/>under vacuum, the solid was washed by centrifugation, three times <lb/>with diethyl ether and two times with 0.01 N HCl. The residue was <lb/>dried in vacuo. Pure compound 4 (15 mg, 0.0072 mmol, 40% yield) <lb/>was obtained by preparative TLC (MeOH/CH 2 Cl 2 , 5:95 v/v). The <lb/>Dde protecting group was removed from compound 4 by treatment <lb/>with 2% hydrazine (1 mL), under stirring, at rt, for 30 min. After <lb/>removal of hydrazine under vacuum, 20% TFA in CH 2 Cl 2 (1 mL) was <lb/>added to the solid, for removing the Boc groups. The mixture was <lb/>stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The solvent was removed under <lb/>vacuum, and the solid was washed three times with diethyl ether by <lb/>centrifugation, to give pure compound 5 after freeze drying (11.4 mg, <lb/>95% yield).

Aβ 42 was dissolved in TFA (1 mg/mL) and <lb/>sonicated for 10 min. Then the TFA was removed under a gentle <lb/>stream of N 2 , 1 mL of HFIP was added, and the mixture was dried <lb/>under N 2 stream to remove the remaining trace of TFA (×2). Aβ 42 <lb/>was again dissolved in 1 mL of HFIP and was frozen at -70 °C and <lb/>then lyophilized overnight. The same procedure was carried out in the <lb/>presence of conjugate 5. <lb/>Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy. CD spectra were acquired using <lb/>a J-810 spectrometer (Jasco, Japan) under a constant flow of N 2 at <lb/>room temperature. The CD spectra were recorded for Aβ 42 (5 μM) <lb/>monomer in the absence and presence of 1 and 5 (5 and 25 μM). The <lb/>lyophilized samples were dissolved in 50 μL of 10 mM NaOH and <lb/>then diluted with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 100 <lb/>mM NaCl to 2 mL to obtain a concentration 5 μM for Aβ 42 alone and <lb/>the mixture of Aβ 42 and conjugate 5 (1:1 and 1:5 molar ratio). A 1 cm <lb/>path length quartz cuvette was used to acquire the far-UV CD spectra <lb/>(190-260 nm) at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. There were 10 scans <lb/>collected. The CD signal of the solution without Aβ 42 was subtracted <lb/>from the sample CD spectra. The measurements were performed in <lb/>triplicate. <lb/>Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assay. ThT fluorescence kinetics were <lb/>measured on a Flash Thermo Varioskan spectrofluorometer with <lb/>excitation and emission at 450 and 480 nm, respectively. Aβ 42 alone <lb/>and in the presence of the conjugates 1 or 5 in 1:1 or 1:5 molar ratio <lb/>was dissolved in 10 mM aq NaOH (30 μL). The samples were diluted <lb/>(to 150 μL) with 60 μM ThT solution in 10 mM phosphate buffer at <lb/>pH 7.4 to obtain a final Aβ 42 concentration of 20 μM. The samples <lb/>were incubated a 37 °C in a 96-well plate. To minimize evaporation <lb/>effects the multiwell plate was sealed with a transparent heat-resistant <lb/>plastic film. Readings were taken every 10 min, after weak shaking for <lb/>10 s. The fluorescence intensity was monitored for 67 h. The <lb/>measurements were performed in triplicate. To minimize errors <lb/>during sample preparation, we freeze dried the aliquots of <lb/>monomerized Aβ 42 and 5 directly into each well of the plate. The <lb/>experimental data were fitted by using the equation: <lb/>= + <lb/>+ <lb/>+ --<lb/>F t <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>nt <lb/>( ) <lb/>1 e t t k <lb/>0 <lb/>max <lb/>/ <lb/>1/2 <lb/>where F 0 is the initial fluorescence emission and F max is the final <lb/>increment of fluorescence emission; 1/k is the elongation rate <lb/>constant, and t 1/2 is the time at which the amplitude of ThT emission <lb/>is 50% of the F max value. t lag is defined as the intercept between the <lb/>time axis and the tangent of the curve with slope k from the midpoint <lb/>of the fitted sigmoidal curve; this parameter was calculated from the <lb/>fitted parameters by using the following equation: t lag = t 1/2 -2k. <lb/>The kinetic parameters are expressed as the mean (±SD) of three <lb/>independent experiments. <lb/>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Electrophoretic Light <lb/>Scattering (ELS). DLS and ELS measurements were carried out on <lb/>a ZetaSizer NanoZS90 Malvern instrument (UK), equipped with a <lb/>633 nm laser at a scattering angle of 90°and 25 °C temperature. The <lb/>size of Aβ 42 , conjugate 5, and Aβ 42 in the presence of 5 was <lb/>determined on samples prepared at the same experimental conditions <lb/>as CD analyses. Each measurement was performed three times. <lb/>Atomic Force Microscopy. AFM analysis was performed with a <lb/>PSIAXE-150 system, acquiring images of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 μm 2 . The <lb/>measurements were carried out in tapping mode using a silicon Sn <lb/>doped tip (resistivity of 0.01 Ω cm and purchased by Bruker TESPA). <lb/>New cantilevers were used for each measurement. Tip dimensions: <lb/>thickness 4 μm, length 125 μm, width 40 μm. The stiffness was 40 N/ <lb/>m, and the tip was operated to an oscillation frequency of 320 kHz. <lb/>An aliquot with a volume of 10 μL of sample was dispensed on a <lb/>precleaned silicon flat substrate and dried. In order to perform a <lb/>representative investigation of whole samples, after deposition the <lb/>substrates were not rinsed with Milli-Q water (as commonly reported <lb/>in literature). For each sample, various areas on the sample were <lb/>investigated and statistically relevant images were chosen. <lb/>Mass Spectrometry Analyses. The lyophilized Aβ 42 was dissolved <lb/>in HFIP (hexafluoroisopropanol) to obtain a concentration of 2.2 × <lb/>10 -4 M (Aβ 42 stock solution). The GPGKLVFF peptide and <lb/>compound 5 were dissolved in HFIP to obtain a stock solution of <lb/>1.1 × 10 -3 M for each. The Aβ 42 sample and the mixtures of Aβ 42 / <lb/>GPGKLVFF and Aβ 42 /5 at 1:5 ratios, were prepared from stock <lb/>solutions to a final concentration [Aβ 42 ] = 5.5 × 10 -6 M, [5] = <lb/>[GPGKLVFF] = 27.5 × 10 -6 M in Milli-Q water at physiological pH. <lb/>For proteolysis experiments, 25 × 10 -6 g of trypsin enzyme was <lb/>dissolved in HCl 1 × 10 -3 M [trypsin] = 2.14 × 10 -5 M, and then an <lb/>appropriate volume of the enzyme stock solution was added to the <lb/>Aβ 42 , Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF, and Aβ 42 /5 samples to obtain a final <lb/>enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 w/w. Solutions were incubated at 37 <lb/>°C, and then the digestion reactions were stopped after 2 h by adding <lb/>1 μL 0.3% aqueous TFA. The samples were analyzed by using an ESI-<lb/>MS Orbitrap Q-exactive system (Thermos Scientific). Each sample <lb/>was introduced into the ESI source on 100 mm internal diameter <lb/>fused silica via a 500 mL syringe. Full MS scans in the m/z range <lb/>400-4000 were acquired in the positive ion mode, spray voltage = 3.5 <lb/>kV, capillary temperature = 300 °C; m/z range = 400-4000, S-lens <lb/>RF level = 60 V, sheath gas = 7, resolving power: 70 000 fwhm. The <lb/>spectra, recorded as raw files, were imported in Qual Browser <lb/>(Thermo Scientific) software for analysis. Averaged MS spectra were <lb/>imported into a freely available open-source software, mMass (http:// <lb/>www.mmass.org). Theoretical m/z values of Aβ 42 , GPGKLVFF, 5, the <lb/>adducts Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF and Aβ 42 /5, and the peptides resulting <lb/>from in silico digestion of Aβ 42 were compared with the m/z values <lb/>assigned to experimental mass spectra. Peptides that matched <lb/>successfully, within a tolerance of 0.005 Da, were annotated. <lb/>Cell Cultures and MTT Assay. The neuroblastoma (NB) cell line, <lb/>SH-SY5Y, was maintained in DMEM-F12 (Gibco, ThermoFisher) <lb/>supplemented with 10% heat inactivated (HI) fetal calf serum (Gibco, <lb/>ThermoFisher), 100 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, <lb/>ThermoFisher), and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . Two weeks <lb/>before experiments, 5 × 10 3 cells were plated on 96-well plates in <lb/>DMEM-F12 with 5% HI fetal calf serum. The percentage of serum <lb/>was gradually decreased until it was 1% of the total. All-trans-retinoic <lb/>acid (RA) (Sigma), 5 μM, was used to promote neuronal <lb/>differentiation, and medium-containing RA was changed every 3 <lb/>days. Treatments with compound 5, KLVFF, and GPGKLVFF were <lb/>performed on fully differentiated cells. After 24 h treatment, cultures <lb/>were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C and then <lb/>lysed with DMSO, and the formazan production was evaluated in a <lb/>plate reader through the absorbance at 570 nm. <lb/>Antioligomerization Assay. Aβ 42 oligomers were prepared as <lb/>previously described 53 from synthetic Aβ 42 following a protocol for <lb/>monomerization. An amount of 1 mg of Aβ 42 was first dissolved in 5 <lb/>mM DMSO. A solution of 10 μM Aβ 42 in ice-cold DMEM F-12 <lb/>without Phenol Red was prepared and allowed to oligomerize for 48 h <lb/>at 4 °C according to the Lambert protocol 54 with some modification <lb/>as previously described. 55 In order to evaluate the ability of <lb/>compound 5 and the other appropriate controls (KLVFF, <lb/>GPGKLVFF), samples of Aβ 42 (10 μM) were incubated in the <lb/>presence or absence of each compound (Aβ/ligand ratios 1:1, 1:5). <lb/>After 48 h incubation, Aβ/ligand compounds were applied to the <lb/>differentiated SH-SY5Y cells at the final concentration of 2 μM Aβ. <lb/>Western Blot Analysis. A stock aliquot of 5 mM Aβ previously <lb/>dissolved in DMSO was diluted in DMEM F-12 without Phenol Red, <lb/>and two different samples at 20 μM and 50 μM concentrations were <lb/>prepared. From each solution, two sets of samples were obtained by <lb/></body>

			<body>combining Aβ 42 with KLVFF peptide, GPGKLVFF, or compound 5 <lb/>with a molar ratio Aβ/peptide of 1:5. All the samples, including Aβ <lb/>alone at the two concentrations used, were incubated at 4 °C for 48 h <lb/>to form Aβ oligomers. After incubation, the amount and size of Aβ <lb/>aggregates were determined by Western blot analysis. A volume of 25 <lb/>μL of each unheated sample was loaded onto a precast Bis-Tris gel <lb/>(Bolt 4-12%, Life Technologies) with 2-morpholin-4-yl ethanesul-<lb/>fonic acid (MES). Samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose <lb/>membrane (0.2 mm, Hybond ECL, Amersham Italia) by using a wet <lb/>transfer unit Mini Blot Module (Life Technologies).
