			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Natural competence allows bacteria to respond to environmental and nutritional cues by taking up free DNA from <lb/>their surroundings, thus gaining both nutrients and genetic information. In the Gram-negative <lb/>bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, the genes needed for DNA uptake are induced by the CRP and Sxy transcription <lb/>factors in response to lack of preferred carbon sources and nucleotide precursors. Here we show that one of these <lb/>genes, HI0659, encodes the antitoxin of a competence-regulated toxin-antitoxin operon (&apos;toxTA&apos;), likely acquired by <lb/>horizontal gene transfer from a Streptococcus species. Deletion of the putative toxin (HI0660) restores uptake to the <lb/>antitoxin mutant. The full toxTA operon was present in only 17 of the 181 strains we examined; complete deletion <lb/>was seen in 22 strains and deletions removing parts of the toxin gene in 142 others. In addition to the expected Sxy-<lb/>and CRP-dependent-competence promoter, HI0659/660 transcript analysis using RNA-seq identified an internal <lb/>antitoxin-repressed promoter whose transcription starts within toxT and will yield nonfunctional protein. We <lb/>propose that the most likely effect of unopposed toxin expression is non-specific cleavage of mRNAs and arrest or <lb/>death of competent cells in the culture. Although the high frequency of toxT and toxTA deletions suggests that this <lb/>competence-regulated toxin-antitoxin system may be mildly deleterious, it could also facilitate downregulation of <lb/>protein synthesis and recycling of nucleotides under starvation conditions. Although our analyses were focused on <lb/>the effects of toxTA, the RNA-seq dataset will be a useful resource for further investigations into competence <lb/>regulation. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Bacterial toxin-antitoxin gene pairs were originally discovered on plasmids, where they function to promote plasmid <lb/>persistence by killing any daughter cells that have not inherited the plasmid. Typically, one gene of the pair encodes a <lb/>relatively stable toxic protein that blocks cell growth, and the other encodes a labile antitoxin (RNA or protein) that <lb/>blocks the toxin&apos;s activity and limits its expression [1,2]. Toxin-antitoxin gene pairs have also been discovered on <lb/>many bacterial chromosomes, where they are thought to be relatively recent introductions that in some cases have <lb/>been co-opted to regulate cellular functions or provide other benefits [3]. Here we describe one such system, which <lb/>is induced in naturally competent cells and whose unopposed toxin completely prevents DNA uptake and <lb/>transformation. <lb/>Many bacteria are naturally competent, able to take up DNA from their surroundings and-when sequence similarity <lb/>allows-recombine it into their genomes [4,5,6]. In most species, DNA uptake is tightly controlled, with protein <lb/>machinery specified by a set of co-regulated chromosomal genes induced in response to diverse cellular signals. <lb/>Genes in the competence regulon encode not only components of the DNA uptake machinery that moves DNA across <lb/>the outer membrane of the cell, but proteins that translocate DNA across the inner membrane, proteins that <lb/>facilitate recombination, and proteins of unknown function. Haemophilus influenzae has an unusually small and well-<lb/>defined competence regulon (26 genes in 13 operons) induced by signals of energy and nucleotide scarcity [7,8]. <lb/>Induction of these genes begins in response to depletion of phosphotransferase sugars. The resulting rise in cyclic <lb/>AMP (cAMP) activates the transcription factor CRP, and the CRP/cAMP complex then stimulates transcription of <lb/>genes with canonical CRP-promoter elements (CRP-N genes). Most of these genes help the cell to use alternative <lb/>carbon sources, but one encodes the competence-specific transcriptional activator Sxy. However, efficient <lb/>translation of sxy mRNA occurs only when purine pools are also depleted [9,10]. If both signals are active, Sxy then <lb/>acts with CRP at the promoters of competence genes, stimulating their expression and leading to DNA uptake and <lb/>natural transformation. These competence promoters are distinguished by the presence of &apos;CRP-S&apos; sites (formerly <lb/>called CRE sites), variants of standard CRP sites that depend on both CRP and Sxy for activation [11], but the specific <lb/>role of Sxy is not yet understood. Development of competence thus requires the CRP/cAMP complex twice, first for <lb/>sxy transcription (at its CRP-N promoter) and then for transcription of the competence genes (at their CRP-S <lb/>promoters). <lb/>All but one of the fifteen Sxy-regulated H. influenzae genes needed for DNA uptake encode typical competence <lb/>proteins -membrane-associated proteins homologous to known components of the Type IV pilus-based DNA <lb/>uptake machinery present in nearly all known naturally competent species [5]. The one exception is HI0659, which <lb/>instead encodes a predicted 98 amino acid cytoplasmic protein with no similarity to known DNA uptake proteins. It <lb/>shares a competence-inducible CRP-S promoter with an upstream gene encoding another short cytoplasmic protein <lb/></body>

			<body>(HI0660, 119 aa) (Fig. 1, top). Although a knockout of HI0659 eliminates detectable DNA uptake and transformation, <lb/>a knockout of HI0660 has no effect [8]. <lb/>Here we show that HI0660 and HI0659 comprise a horizontally transferred operon that encodes a toxin-antitoxin <lb/>pair, and that expression of the toxin in the absence of the antitoxin completely prevents DNA uptake and <lb/>transformation. Surprisingly, expression of this toxin has only modest effects on induction of competence genes and <lb/>on cell growth and viability. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>HI0659 and HI0660 act as a toxin-antitoxin system that affects natural competence. Our original analyses of <lb/>competence-induced genes did not identify any close homologs of HI0659 or HI0660 [7,8]. However subsequent <lb/>recent database searches and examination of BLASTP results revealed that these genes&apos; products resemble proteins <lb/>in the Type II toxin/antitoxin families, which typically occur in similar two-gene operons. If HI0660 and HI0659 do <lb/>encode a toxin-antitoxin pair, then ∆HI0659&apos;s DNA uptake defect would likely be caused by unopposed expression of <lb/>a HI0660-encoded toxin protein that prevents DNA uptake, and knocking out this toxin gene would restore <lb/>competence to the HI0659 (antitoxin -) mutant. We tested this by constructing an HI0660/HI0659 double mutant (Fig. <lb/>1) and examining its ability to be transformed with antibiotic-resistant chromosomal DNA (MAP7) compared to wild <lb/>type or either single mutant. The double mutant had normal transformation (Fig. 2, black bars), showing that <lb/>mutation of HI0660 suppresses the competence defect of an HI0659 mutant, and also that neither HI0660 nor <lb/>HI0659 is directly needed for the development of competence. This supported the postulated antitoxin function of <lb/>HI0660, so we named the HI0660 and HI0659 genes toxT (toxin) and toxA (antitoxin) respectively. <lb/>Figure 1: Structure of wildtype and mutant toxTA genes.

Complete or partial toxTA operons <lb/>were found at the same genomic location in most H. influenzae genomes and in the closely related H. haemolyticus <lb/>(see below), but there were no recognizable homologs in most other bacteria, including most other members of the <lb/>Pasteurellaceae. Instead, most identifiable homologs (with about 60% amino acid identity) were in a very distant <lb/></body>

			<body>group, the Firmicutes, mainly within the streptococci. Ninety-six of the top 100 BLASTP hits to ToxT outside the <lb/>Pasteurellaceae were to diverse Streptococcus species. This suggests that the toxTA operon may have been <lb/>transferred from a Firmicute into a recent ancestor of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus. When we excluded <lb/>Streptococcus from the BLAST search, sporadic matches were found in a wide variety of other taxa. In addition, toxTA <lb/>operons with about 50% identity were found in one other small distant Pasteurellacean subclade (Actinobacillus <lb/>sensu stricto), and on two 11kb plasmids (pRGRH1858 and pRGFK1025) from an uncultured member of a rat gut <lb/>microbiome and an uncultivated Selenomonas sp. The genes flanking the A. pleuropneumoniae homologs are <lb/>unrelated to those flanking HI0659 and HI0660. The distribution of toxTA homologs across taxa is summarized in Fig. <lb/>3A. <lb/>Figure 3: Distribution of toxTA homologs in bacterial genomes. A. Summary of BLASTP results.

Inset: Pasteurellacean phylogeny from Redfield et al. 2006. B. Unrooted maximum likelihood phylogeny of <lb/>concatenated ToxT and ToxA homologs from selected species where both were detected. Numbers at nodes are <lb/>bootstrap values. Species abbreviations: Apl: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae; Aeq: A. equuli; Asu: A. suis; <lb/>Haemophilus haemolyticus; Hin: H. influenzae; Ssa: Streptococcus salivarius; Ssu: S. suis; San: S. anginosus; Sco: S. <lb/>constellatus; Sol: S. oligofermentans; Spn: S. pneumoniae; Sth: S. thermophilus. <lb/>To resolve the history of gene transfer events in the two Pasteurellaceae sub-clades, we created an unrooted <lb/>maximum likelihood phylogeny from the concatenated alignment of toxT and toxA amino acid sequences from <lb/>selected species where both genes were found (Fig. 3B). Although a Haemophilus-Actinobacillus clade has 99% <lb/>bootstrap support, the absence of homologs from all other Pasteurellaceae makes a single Pasteurellacean origin <lb/>unlikely, since it would require multiple deletions in other Pasteurellacean subclades or a near-simultaneous within-<lb/>clade lateral transfer. Since the Actinobacillus sequences are also more similar to Streptococcus sequences than to <lb/>the Haemophilus sequences, the two Pasteurallacean groups are more likely to have acquired their toxTA operons by <lb/>independent lateral transfers, from Firmicutes. <lb/>Deletions in H. influenzae toxT are common: Of the 181 H. influenzae genome sequences available in public <lb/>databases, 162 had recognizable toxA sequences. All of these encoded full length ToxA proteins, but all except 24 <lb/>had one of two common deletions affecting toxT. The extents of these deletions are shown by the grey bars at the <lb/>bottom of Fig. 4. The most common deletion (n=97) removed 178 bp of toxT coding sequence but left both <lb/>promoters intact. The second (n=45) removed 306 bp of sequence including both toxTA promoters and the toxT start <lb/>codon. The 19 genomes that lacked recognizable toxA sequences all had the same 1015 bp deletion removing both <lb/>toxT and toxA but leaving the flanking genes intact. In place of the missing sequences were 87 bp with no high-<lb/>scoring BLAST alignments in GenBank. The average pairwise distance among the 162 toxA genes is 0.106, slightly <lb/></body>

			<body>higher than the average of all genes with one copy per strain (0.088). The d N /d S ratio of 0.037 is consistent with mild <lb/>purifying selection on toxA and is higher than that of the average gene (0.243). However, this may underestimate the <lb/>strength of selection, since most toxAs lack functional toxT, no strains with toxT only were seen, and the operon may <lb/>not be expressed due to upstream deletions. Both sequence divergence and the high frequency of toxT deletions <lb/>agree with expectations for a toxin/antitoxin system whose antitoxin protects against a toxin that is at least mildly <lb/>deleterious. <lb/>Figure 4: Natural deletions in the toxTA operon. Top line: structure of the wildtype toxTA operon in strain KW20. <lb/>Lower lines: grey bars indicate the spans of the three naturally occurring deletions among the 181 available <lb/>sequences, annotated with the number of sequences with each deletion <lb/>Variation in toxTA is independent of strain-specific variations in DNA uptake and transformation. Maughan and <lb/>Redfield [15] measured the ability of 34 H. influenzae strains to both take up DNA and become transformed, so we <lb/>examined this data for correlations with the presence of toxTA in the 19 of these strains with genome assemblies <lb/>whose toxTA genotypes we were able to determine. All but one of the 19 strains had a complete toxA coding <lb/>sequence but only five had intact toxTA operons. Of the rest, four had the large deletion that removed both toxTA <lb/>promoters, nine had the smaller deletion internal to toxT, and one had the 1015 bp complete deletion. There was no <lb/>obvious correlation between the toxTA genotypes and the DNA uptake or transformation phenotypes, but there was <lb/>insufficient data for a high-powered analysis using allelic variation. <lb/>The Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae toxTA operon does not control growth or competence: The A. <lb/>pleuropneumoniae toxTA operon was originally reported to have the CRP-S promoter typical of competence operons <lb/>[16]. Although reexamination of the promoter region failed to identify a high-quality CRP-S site, we constructed toxT, <lb/>toxA and toxTA knockout mutants to investigate whether a toxA deletion would prevent competence. There were no <lb/>significant differences between the transformation frequencies of wildtype cells and toxA mutants (Fig. 2, blue bars), <lb/>and the rich-medium growth properties of all mutants in the wells of a BioScreen incubator were identical to those of <lb/>wildtype cells (Supp. Fig. A). Thus, we conclude that the toxTA homolog in A. pleuropneumoniae does not affect <lb/>competence. A previously reported RNA-seq study [17] of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype JL03 [18] found low-level <lb/>expression of the toxTA homologs in a log-phase culture in rich medium, but competent cultures have not been <lb/>examined. <lb/>Growth and competence phenotypes of H. influenzae toxTA mutants: Earlier investigation of DNA uptake and <lb/>transformation by the H. influenzae toxA knockout strain found that both were below the limit of detection (&gt;100-<lb/>fold reduction and &gt;10 6 -fold reduction respectively) after the standard competence-inducing treatment [8] (see also <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 2), although there was no apparent growth defect in rich medium. Supp. Fig B confirms the non-transformability <lb/>of ∆toxA cells both in log phase growth and at intermediate time points during competence induction. <lb/>A simple explanation for this defect would be that unopposed ToxT prevents competence, when not opposed by <lb/>ToxA, by killing or otherwise inactivating the (competence-induced) cells in which it is expressed. To detect effects of <lb/>unopposed expression of toxT toxin, we analyzed growth rates of wildtype and ∆toxA strains (Fig. 5) before, during, <lb/>and after transfer to the competence-inducing starvation medium MIV. The first 60 min of Fig. 5 show that <lb/>unopposed expression of toxT toxin slightly slows exponential growth in rich medium. A more detailed analysis of <lb/>growth of rich-medium cultures using BioScreen wells is provided in Supp. Fig. C; the growth defect of the ∆toxA <lb/>strain is barely detectable under this condition. This lack of a severe growth defect is not surprising; because the <lb/>toxTA promoter is regulated by a CRP-S site, its expression (and thus ToxT production) might be limited to competent <lb/>cells even in the absence of ToxA [7]. The grey-shaded portion of Fig. 5 shows cell growth after transfer to MIV <lb/>(samples between 70 min and 165 min). Cells transferred to MIV usually undergo only one or two doublings, and <lb/>deletion of toxA delays this but does not eliminate it (see also Supp. Fig. D). Cells returned to rich medium from MIV <lb/>might be delayed in their recovery, if unopposed toxin expression during competence development kills cells or halts <lb/>growth. However, both strains had similar recovery kinetics after a fraction of their culture was returned to rich <lb/>medium, although ∆toxA cells again grew slightly slower than wildtype (175-230 min in Fig. 5). Supp. Fig. E shows the <lb/>OD 600 readings corresponding to the CFU/ml data shown in Fig. 5. These agree well, showing that differences in cell <lb/>growth can be explained by the differences in cell division. <lb/>Figure 5: Growth of H. influenzae wildtype and ∆toxA cells before, during and after competence induction. Log-<lb/>phase cells in sBHI were transferred to MIV at t=65 min; a portion of each MIV culture was diluted 10-fold into sBHI <lb/>at t=170 min. The grey-shaded area indicates samples taken from MIV cultures. Blue: KW20, orange: ∆toxA. Supp. <lb/>Fig. E shows the corresponding OD600 values. <lb/>Since cyclic AMP is required for normal induction of the competence genes, and addition of cAMP induces partial <lb/>competence during exponential growth [19], we also tested the effect of cAMP on the ∆toxA knockout. Addition of <lb/>cAMP did not rescue its transformation defect (Supp. Fig. F), so failure to transform is not caused by defective cAMP <lb/>production in the antitoxin mutant. <lb/>Since some chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems have acquired beneficial roles in modulating cell growth [20], we <lb/>also examined whether the absence of toxin changed growth and competence under various conditions. The grey <lb/>line in Supp. Fig. C shows that, under BioScreen growth assay conditions, ∆toxT&apos;s growth was indistinguishable from <lb/>that of wildtype cells (blue line), and Fig. 2 shows that its MIV-induced competence is also unchanged. Supp. Fig. G <lb/>shows that the kinetics of ∆toxT competence development and loss during growth in rich medium were also <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>indistinguishable from wildtype. We conclude that ToxT&apos;s normal expression in cells expressing antitoxin does not <lb/>detectably regulate growth or the development or loss of competence. Unfortunately, inferring the relationship <lb/>between competence and growth is complicated because many cells in &apos;competent&apos; cultures are unable to transform. <lb/>In some species the non-transformable cells are known to have not induced their competence genes, but this has not <lb/>been investigated for H. influenzae. <lb/>Transcriptional control of competence: Since these phenotypic analyses gave little evidence of MIV-specific toxicity <lb/>or insight into the cause of the competence defect, we used RNA-seq to investigate how toxTA is regulated and how <lb/>mutations affect expression of competence genes. In these experiments, samples for RNA preparations were taken <lb/>from three replicate cultures at four time points, first when cells were growing in log phase in the rich medium sBHI <lb/>(t=0), and then at 10, 30 and 100 minutes after each culture had been transferred to MIV. We first examined how <lb/>competence induction in wildtype and regulatory-mutant cells changed expression of genes known to be regulated <lb/>by CRP and CRP+Sxy (CRP-N and CRP-S genes respectively). Fig. 6 gives an overview of the results. The top row <lb/>shows competence-induced changes in transcript abundances in wildtpe cells at 10, 30 and 100 minutes, and the <lb/>lower rows show that some of these changes do not occur in ∆crp and ∆sxy cells. Each coloured dot represents a <lb/>gene, colour-coded by function. Its horizontal position indicates its level of expression in rich medium (T=0) and its <lb/>vertical position indicates how this expression changed in MIV (top row -wildtype cells, lower rows, ∆crp and ∆sxy <lb/>cells). Thus in Fig. 6A the higher positions of the dark blue dots (genes regulated by CRP-N sites) and the red <lb/>diamond (the competence regulator sxy) indicate that they were strongly induced after 10 min in MIV. Induction of <lb/>sxy was followed at 30 and 100 minutes by strong induction of the known competence-regulon genes (higher <lb/>positions of CRP-S genes; light green dots) (Fig. 6 B and C). Consistent with prior studies [7], induction of all these <lb/>genes was blocked by deletion of the crp gene (Fig. 6 D-F), and induction of the competence regulon (CRP-S) genes <lb/>was blocked by deletion of sxy (Fig. 6 G-I). Analysis of other competence-associated changes in gene expression in <lb/>normal cells and in ∆crp and ∆sxy mutants is provided in the Supplementary Materials. <lb/>Figure 6: Competence-induced changes in expression of H. influenzae genes regulated by CRP and Sxy. Each dot <lb/>represents a gene, colour-coded by function: pink diamond: sxy; light green dot: CRP-S-regulated; blue dot: CRP-N-<lb/>regulated; red dot: purR regulon; yellow dot: tryptophan regulon; dark green dot: tRNA; purple dot: ribosomal <lb/>proteins; grey dot: other or unknown functions. Each dot&apos;s horizontal position indicates the gene&apos;s relative level of <lb/>expression (as FPKM) in rich medium (t=0) and its vertical position indicates how this expression changed at later <lb/>time points (A: t=10; B: t=30; C: t=100) or in a mutant background at T=30 (D-F; ∆crp; G-I: ∆sxy). <lb/>Transcriptional control of toxTA: RNA-seq analysis confirmed that toxTA is regulated as a typical competence <lb/>operon. In wildtype cells, baseline RNA-seq expression of toxT and toxA was very low during log phase in rich <lb/>medium, with approximately tenfold induction after 30 minutes incubation in MIV (green lines and points in Fig. 7 <lb/></body>

			<body>(toxT) and Supp. Fig. H (toxA). As expected, this increase was eliminated by knockouts of CRP and Sxy (brown and <lb/>blue lines and points in Fig. &amp; and Supp. Fig H). Like other CRP-S genes, both toxT and toxA were also strongly <lb/>induced in rich medium by sxy and murE mutations known to cause hypercompetence [38,39] and by a newly <lb/>identified hypercompetence mutation in rpoD (Supp. Fig. I). Thus the toxTA operon is regulated as a typical member <lb/>of the competence regulon. <lb/>Figure 7: Competence-induced changes in expression of H. influenzae toxT. Sample FPKM values (dots) and means <lb/>(lines) for toxT (HI0660). Strains: wildtype: green; ∆crp: brown; ∆sxy: blue; ∆toxA: red; ∆toxT: grey; ∆toxTA: black. <lb/>The values for the ∆toxT and ∆toxTA samples are underestimates because most of the gene has been deleted in <lb/>these strains. <lb/>RNA-seq analysis also showed that the toxTA operon is regulated as a typical type II toxin-antitoxin operon. In such <lb/>operons, the antitoxin protein usually binds to the toxin protein, which protects cells from the toxin in two ways. <lb/>First, antitoxin binding inactivates the toxin. Second, it also activates the antitoxin component as a repressor of the <lb/>toxTA promoter [2,21]. H. influenzae ToxA has a HTH-XRE DNA-binding domain, which is commonly found in <lb/>promoter-binding antitoxins [1,13], and the RNA-seq analysis in Fig. 7 strongly suggests that it represses toxTA <lb/>transcription. The ∆toxA mutant retains an intact toxTA promoter and toxT coding sequence (see Fig. 1); it had 9-fold <lb/>increased baseline expression of toxT in log phase cells (red line and points in Fig. 7). Expression increased further <lb/>during competence development, with the same kinetics as in wildtype cells, suggesting independent contributions <lb/>from baseline repression by antitoxin and competence induction by CRP and Sxy. (Values for toxA expression are <lb/>shown by the red points and line in Supp Fig. H, but are underestimates because most of the gene has been deleted.) <lb/>Because most antitoxins have only weak affinity for DNA in the absence of their cognate toxin, ToxA was predicted to <lb/>repress toxTA only when bound to ToxT. Therefore, we were initially surprised that knocking out toxT or both toxT <lb/>and toxA did not increase RNA-seq coverage of residual toxT sequences (Fig. 7, grey and black lines) and that <lb/>knocking out both genes did not increase coverage of residual toxA (grey line in Supp Fig. H). These deletion mutants <lb/>retain all the toxTA upstream sequences and the toxT start codon, and enough sequence of the deleted genes to <lb/>identify them in the RNA-seq analysis. An explanation was suggested by a recent study of the Escherichia coli hicAB <lb/>toxin/antitoxin system [22], and confirmed by more detailed analysis of toxTA transcripts. The HicA (toxin) and HicB <lb/>(antitoxin) proteins have no detectable sequence homology to ToxT and ToxA, but their operon is similarly regulated <lb/>by Sxy and has the same atypical organization (toxin before antitoxin) [23]. Turnbull and Gerdes [22] showed that <lb/>the hicAB operon has two promoters. Promoter P1 has a CRP-S site regulated by CRP and Sxy, which is not repressed <lb/>by the HicB antitoxin. A secondary promoter P2 is very close to the hicA start codon; it is repressed by HicB <lb/>independently of HicA, and its shortened transcripts produce only functional HicB, not HicA. Promoter P1 of this <lb/>hicAB system thus resembles the CRP-S regulation of the toxTA operon, and the presence of a second antitoxin-<lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>regulated internal promoter similar to P2 would explain the high toxTA operon expression seen in the toxA <lb/>knockouts. This finding prompted us to do a more detailed analysis of toxTA transcription patterns in wildtype and <lb/>mutant cells to determine whether the toxTA transcripts expressed in the absence of toxA were similarly truncated. <lb/>Figure 8A shows RNA-seq coverage of the toxTA promoter region and the 5&apos; half of toxT, in wildtype cells (green) and <lb/>in the toxA deletion mutant (purple). As expected, the predicted CRP-S promoter upstream of toxTA was only slightly <lb/>active at T=10 but strongly induced at T=30 and T=100 (note log scale); its activity was not affected by deletion of <lb/>toxA. Deletion of toxA instead caused strong constitutive transcription from a second promoter (&apos;P2&apos;), with reads <lb/>beginning about 30 bp downstream of the toxT start codon. Transcripts with this 5&apos; end are unlikely to produce <lb/>active ToxT; the only other in-frame AUG in toxT is 30 bp from the end of the gene, and it and the first GUG (position <lb/>35) lack Shine-Dalgarno sequences. This supports the hypothesis that the H. influenzae toxTA operon is regulated <lb/>similarly to the E. coli hicAB operon, with Sxy-induced expression from a CRP-S promoter and antitoxin-repressed <lb/>transcription from a downstream &apos;P2&apos; promoter whose transcript produces antitoxin but not toxin. <lb/>Figure 8: Sequencing read coverage of the H. influenzae toxTA promoter region.

To look for parallels in H. influenzae&apos;s toxTA, we more precisely measured transcription <lb/>in wildtype and toxTA mutant cells by scoring the coverage at two positions in the toxTA operon; each is indicated by <lb/>a red vertical line at the bottom of Fig. 8A. Position 0 is the toxT start codon, 34 nt downstream from the CRP-S <lb/>promoter (P CRP-S ) but upstream of the putative P2 promoter, and position 100 is 70 nt downstream from P2 (P2 and <lb/>position 100 are deleted in ∆toxT). To eliminate read-mapping artefacts arising from failure of reads that span an <lb/>insertion or deletion to align to the reference sequence, each mutant&apos;s reads were instead mapped onto its own <lb/>toxTA sequence. Comparison of Figures 8B and 8C shows that coverage at position 100 was always higher than <lb/>coverage at position 0, consistent with the presence of a second promoter between positions 0 and 100. Fig. 8B also <lb/>shows that coverage at position 0 (expression from P CRP-S ) was reduced by all of the toxTA deletions. This was <lb/>unexpected, and suggests that this promoter may have unusual properties, since coverage of other CRP-S genes was <lb/>not similarly affected. The toxA deletion caused the predicted increase in coverage at position 100 (Fig. 8C), but the <lb/>toxTA deletion unexpectedly reduced rather than increased coverage at this position ~3-fold from the wildtype level, <lb/>even though this construct retains the first 150 bp of the operon, including P2. This reduction was not accounted for <lb/></body>

			<body>by the reduction in expression from P CRP-S , suggesting that high-level transcription from the toxTA P2 promoter only <lb/>occurs when ToxT is present and ToxA is absent. This could mean either that ToxT directly binds the P2 promoter to <lb/>induce transcription, which seems unlikely given its lack of DNA-binding domain, or that the presence of ToxT <lb/>disrupts binding of a secondary repressor of the operon, such as a noncognate antitoxin [2]. Alternatively, it is <lb/>possible that that the reduced expression in the ∆toxTA mutant instead reflects reduced transcript stability in this <lb/>mutant. <lb/>Unopposed ToxT does not block induction of the competence regulon: Expression of the competence operons that <lb/>these regulators induce was also normal or near-normal in the ∆toxA mutant at 30 min after transfer to MIV, the <lb/>time when competence-induced gene expression is normally highest (Fig. 9). Modest decreases in expression were <lb/>seen for some operons, but these are not expected to cause the absolute competence defect, for two reasons. First, <lb/>competence gene expression levels at this time were very similar between the ∆toxA mutant, which cannot take up <lb/>any DNA or produce any transformants (dark blue bars), and the ∆toxT and ∆toxTA mutants (other blue bars), which <lb/>have normal competence. Second, an unrelated regulatory defect mutation, a knockout of hfq, causes a more <lb/>extreme reduction in gene expression at 30 min (brown bars) but this causes a much less extreme competence defect <lb/>(only 10-20 fold rather than &gt;10 6 -fold; green line in Supp. Fig. B). Mutation of toxTA genes also did not substantially <lb/>change expression of the sxy, crp and cya genes encoding the competence regulon regulators Sxy, CRP, and <lb/>adenylate cyclase (Supp. Fig. J). At t=100 the ∆toxA mutant showed a stronger reduction in RNA-seq coverage of <lb/>competence genes (Supp. Fig. K), however this cannot explain the competence defect and its significance is unclear. <lb/>Fig. 9. RNA-seq analysis of H. influenzae toxTA effects on competence-operon expression. Bars show the relative <lb/>expression (as FPKM) of competence operons in four different mutants after 30 minutes of competence induction: <lb/>∆toxA: dark blue, ∆toxT: blue, ∆toxTA: light blue, ∆hfq: brown. Expression of each operon is relative to its expression <lb/>in wildtype cells at the same time point (grey horizontal bar). Error bars indicate standard errors of samples from <lb/>three replicate cultures. <lb/>Other ToxT and ToxA effects in competence-induced cells: The severe competence defect of ∆toxA was also not <lb/>explained by expression changes in other genes. Supp. Table 3 lists, for each timepoint, the genes whose expression <lb/>in the ∆toxA mutant differed significantly from expression in all three strains with normal competence (wildtype, <lb/>∆toxT and ∆toxTA). The most consistent effect was overexpression of the HI0655-58 operon immediately <lb/>downstream from toxTA. Analysis of sequencing coverage in this region showed this to be caused by read-through <lb/>transcription from both toxTA promoters (CRP-S and P2). The operon includes genes encoding shikimate <lb/>dehydrogenase, an ABC transporter, and a hypothetical protein with putative topoisomerase I domains. Expression <lb/>of genes in this operon increased about 1.2-1.5-fold in MIV in wildtype cells and in other mutants with normal <lb/>competence, so their higher expression in ∆toxA is unlikely to be responsible for this strain&apos;s competence defect. <lb/></body>

			<body>Several other genes showed consistent changes relative to most or all competent strains, but these only sometimes <lb/>reached statistical significance. HI0231 (deaD) encodes a DEADbox helicase involved in ribosome assembly and <lb/>mRNA decay [24]; its expression in control strains fell rapidly on transfer to MIV, but levels in ∆toxA were about 50% <lb/>higher at all time points. HI0235 contains an ArfA ribosome-rescue domain [25]; its expression was up 3-5-fold at <lb/>t=30 and 2-3-fold at t=100 in the ∆toxT and ∆toxTA comparisons, but not in the KW20 comparison. HI0362 encodes a <lb/>CRP-regulated iron-transport protein that normally increases in MIV but did not increase in toxA deletion mutants. <lb/>HI0504 (rbsB, a ribose transporter component) is normally induced 20-fold more in MIV than other genes in its <lb/>operon, but this increase was smaller (only 10-fold) in ∆toxA. Expression of HI0595 (arcC, carbamate kinase) <lb/>normally falls 2-3-fold immediately after transfer to MIV, but the fall was greater in ∆toxA. 28 other genes were <lb/>significantly changed only at t=100, but their expression patterns and predicted functions were diverse and did not <lb/>suggest an explanation for ∆toxA&apos;s lack of competence. <lb/>Related toxins may suggest mechanism of action for ToxT: Since examination of gene expression shed little light on <lb/>how the ToxT toxin prevents competence, and it has no close homologs with characterized functions, we considered <lb/>the modes of action of other Type II toxins. The most common type II toxins (e.g. RelE) act as translation-blocking <lb/>ribonucleases, but several alternative modes of action are also known, and some newly discovered toxins lack <lb/>identified activities [13]. The Pfam and TAfinder databases assign the H. influenzae ToxT protein to the ParE/RelE <lb/>toxin superfamily, whose characterized members include both gyrase inhibitors and ribonucleases that arrest cell <lb/>growth by cleaving mRNAs and other RNAs [2,26,27]. <lb/>Unopposed toxin does not inhibit gyrase: If ToxT inhibited gyrase we would expect the RNA-seq data to show that <lb/>transfer to MIV caused increased expression of gyrA (HI1264) and gyrB (HI0567) and reduced expression of topA <lb/>(HI1365), since these genes have opposing activities and compensatory regulation by DNA supercoiling [28]. <lb/>However, these genes&apos; coverage levels were similar in wildtype and all toxTA mutants, during both exponential <lb/>growth and competence development. <lb/>Unopposed toxin does not cleave competence-induced mRNAs at specific sites: The best-studied homologs of the <lb/>toxT toxin act by cleaving mRNAs at positions near their 5&apos; ends during their translation on the ribosome [29,30]. <lb/>Because the resulting &apos;non-stop&apos; mRNAs lack in-frame stop codons and cannot undergo the normal ribosome-release <lb/>process, this causes a general block to translation [31] which is predicted to arrest cell growth until normal <lb/>translation can be restored [32]. Thus we considered whether ToxT might prevent competence by one of two <lb/>mechanisms. First, ToxT might specifically cleave the 5&apos; ends of competence-gene transcripts, eliminating their <lb/>function without significantly changing their overall RNA-seq coverage levels or otherwise interfering with essential <lb/>cell functions. Visual examination of RNA-seq coverage of all positions within the competence operons did not reveal <lb/>any anomalies that might indicate that the mRNA in ∆toxA cells had been inactivated either by cleavage at specific <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>sites or by random cleavage near the 5&apos; end [33]. As an example, Supp Fig. L compares read coverage across the <lb/>comNOPQ operon in wildtype and ∆toxA cultures after 30 min in MIV. To detect nonspecific cleavage we examined <lb/>the insert sizes of our RNA-seq sequencing libraries by comparing the spanning-length distributions of paired-end <lb/>sequencing reads among strains. Because independent library preparations had different insert sizes, comparisons <lb/>were limited to samples prepared at the same time. Fig. 10 shows that the ∆toxA samples from library batch 1 had <lb/>shorter fragment sizes than the KW20 samples from the same batch, and that the difference increased as the time <lb/>after competence induction increased. This supports the hypothesis that the extreme lack of competence in ∆toxA <lb/>cultures is due to non-specific ToxT cleavage of mRNAs. This mechanism is consistent with those of homologous <lb/>HigB/RelE toxins, which inhibit translation by cleavage of mRNA at the ribosomal A-site [34,35]. <lb/>Fig. 10. Distribution of insert-size differences between H. influenzae RNA-seq libraries prepared at the same time. <lb/>Distribution of insert length differences between KW20 (kw20_A and kw20_B samples) and ∆toxA (antx_A samples) <lb/>after 0, 10, 30 and 100 minutes in MIV. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Our investigation into why a HI0659 knockout prevents competence has provided a simple answer: HI0659 encodes <lb/>an antitoxin (ToxA) needed to block the expression and competence-preventing activity of the toxin encoded by <lb/>HI0660 (ToxT). But this answer has generated a number of new questions that we have only been able to partially <lb/>answer. Why is competence controlled by a toxin/antitoxin system? How does it completely abolish DNA uptake <lb/>and transformation without causing significant cell death? Do its effects in wildtype cells confer any benefit to the <lb/>cells, either generally or specific to competence? <lb/>Several findings support the conclusion that HI0660 and HI0659 encode proteins that function as a toxin/antitoxin <lb/>pair. First is the similarity of the encoded ToxT and ToxA proteins to biochemically characterized toxin and antitoxin <lb/>proteins of the RelE/ParE families. Second, and the strongest evidence, is the restoration of normal DNA uptake and <lb/>transformation to antitoxin-knockout cells when the putative toxin is also knocked out. Third is the regulatory <lb/>similarity between this system and the hicAB system of E. coli. <lb/>How did the toxTA operon come to be in the H. influenzae genome and under competence regulation? <lb/>Phylogenetic analysis showed that H. influenzae acquired its toxTA operon by horizontal transfer, either into a deep <lb/>ancestor of the Pasteurellaceae or more recently by independent transfers into ancestors of H. influenzae and A. <lb/>pleuropneumoniae. The closest relatives of the H. influenzae toxTA genes are in the distantly related Firmicutes, <lb/>with homologs especially common in Streptococcus species. Since the Streptococci and Pasteurellaceae share both <lb/></body>

			<body>natural competence and respiratory-tract niches in many mammals, there may have been frequent opportunities for <lb/>horizontal transfer between them. <lb/>We do not know how the toxTA operon came to be under CRP-S regulation. The toxTA operon&apos;s strong regulatory <lb/>parallels with the E. coli hicAB system suggest that toxin-antitoxin systems with similar regulation and function have <lb/>adopted similar roles in separate instances, a phenomenon which is more likely in toxin antitoxin systems as they <lb/>undergo frequent horizontal transfers and are often under strong selective pressure. The sxy gene and the CRP-S <lb/>promoters it regulates are not known outside of the Gamma-Proteobacteria sub-clade that contains the <lb/>Vibrionaceae, Enterobacteraceae, Pasteurellaceae and Orbaceae [11]. Thus, it would be interesting to examine the <lb/>regulation and function of the toxTA homologs outside the Pasteurellaceae to determine when and where it adopted <lb/>a regulatory role and the mechanism of the toxic activity. Examining these homologs could give insight into both the <lb/>mechanism of action of the H. influenzae toxTA system, and its evolutionary history. <lb/>How does unopposed ToxT prevent DNA uptake and transformation? The transformation defect caused by deletion <lb/>of the antitoxin gene toxA is very severe, so it was surprising that RNA-seq analysis detected only few and minor <lb/>changes in expression of competence genes. Instead, the best explanation is that ToxT is an mRNA-cleaving <lb/>ribonuclease, whose activity causes a general block to translation that prevents functioning of the induced <lb/>competence genes. The most direct evidence is the decrease in insert size distributions seen in ∆toxA mutants, but <lb/>this conclusion is also supported by the combination of regulatory similarities between the toxTA and hicAB systems <lb/>and by sequence similarities between the ToxT protein and HigB ribonuclease toxins. <lb/>Why then does the ∆toxA mutant not suffer from growth arrest or toxicity? Part of the explanation is that mRNAs <lb/>encoding functional ToxT are only expressed after cells have been transferred to competence-inducing starvation <lb/>medium, a condition that severely slows cell growth and division even in wildtype cells. Detecting the predicted <lb/>competence-specific toxicity is further complicated by the uneven distribution of transformability in competence-<lb/>induced cells. Co-transformation experiments using multiple unlinked markers consistently show that no more than <lb/>half, and sometimes as little as 10%, of the cells in a MIV-treated culture produce recombinants [6]. We do not know <lb/>whether only the transforming cells express the competence genes or all cells express them but some fail to correctly <lb/>assemble the DNA uptake or recombination machinery. If only a modest fraction of the cells in a competent culture <lb/>are expressing the toxin then any toxic effect on culture growth and survival will be more difficult to detect. <lb/>Does this operon confer any benefit (or harm) on H. influenzae? Why have a competence-regulating toxin/antitoxin <lb/>system at all, when it has no detectable effect on competence unless its antitoxin component is defective? Although <lb/>regulatory parallels with the hicAB system suggest that CRP-S regulation is not incidental, we found no direct <lb/>evidence of any toxin-dependent alteration to the normal development of competence. Production of Sxy is subject <lb/></body>

			<body>to post-transcriptional regulation by the availability of nucleotide precursors [9,10], and we have elsewhere proposed <lb/>that DNA uptake is an adaptation to obtain nucleotides when nucleotide scarcity threatens to arrest DNA replication <lb/>forks [6]. In this context, competence-induction of the toxTA operon may be a specialization to help cells survive, by <lb/>slowing or arresting protein synthesis until the nucleotide supply is restored. <lb/>On the other hand, the high frequency of deletions that remove either complete toxTA or both promoters (35%) <lb/>indicates that the operon is dispensable. And the even higher frequency of toxin-inactivating deletions in the <lb/>presence of intact antitoxin genes and CRP-S promoter (51%), coupled with the absence of any deletion that <lb/>inactivates antitoxin but preserves toxin, indicates that unopposed toxin is indeed harmful under some natural <lb/>circumstances. <lb/>We have examined the toxTA operon from many angles and answered our initial question of why toxA knockout <lb/>prevents competence in H. influenzae, but have raised new questions whose eventual answers we hope will give us <lb/>greater insight not just into the toxTA system, but competence regulation in general. A number of desirable follow-<lb/>up experiments could improve understanding of the toxTA system, particularly complementation experiments to <lb/>determine whether ToxA expression in ∆toxA can restore competence, and whether ToxT expression in ∆toxTA can <lb/>block competence. In future work, it would also be valuable to express ToxT and ToxA in E. coli on separate plasmids <lb/>to examine the system&apos;s toxicity and effect on competence. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions <lb/>Bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Supp Table 1. Escherichia coli strain DH5 [F80lacZ #(lacIZYA-argF) <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>endA1] was used for all cloning steps; it was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C and was made competent <lb/>with rubidium chloride according to the method provided in the QIAexpressionist manual protocol 2 (Qiagen). When <lb/>antibiotic selection was required, 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 50µg/mL spectinomycin were used. <lb/>Haemophilus influenzae cells were grown in sBHI medium (Brain Heart Infusion medium supplemented with <lb/>10mg/mL hemin and 2mg/mL NAD) at 37°C in a shaking water bath (liquid cultures) or incubator (plates). H. <lb/>influenzae strain Rd KW20 [36], the standard laboratory strain, was used as the wild type for all experiments. Mutant <lb/>strains used in this study were marked deletion mutants in which the coding region of the gene was replaced by a <lb/>spectinomycin resistance cassette, as well as unmarked deletion mutants derived from these strains; the generation <lb/>of these mutant strains is described in [8]. Specifically, we used an unmarked deletion of HI0659 (HI0659-), marked <lb/></body>

			<body>and unmarked deletions of HI0660 (HI0660::spec, HI0660-), and a marked deletion of the whole operon <lb/>(HI0659/HI0660::spec). Knockout mutants of crp and sxy have been described previously [37,38]. <lb/>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cells were grown in BHI-N medium (Brain Heart Infusion medium supplemented <lb/>with 100µg/mL NAD) at 37°C. A. pleuropneumoniae strain HS143 [40] was used as the wild type for all experiments. <lb/>Marked deletion mutants in which the gene of interest was replaced by a spectinomycin resistance cassette strains <lb/>were generated for this study as described below. The HS143 genome region containing the homologs of the <lb/>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 5b strain L20 APL_1357 and APL_1358 genes, plus approximately 1 kb of <lb/>flanking sequence on each side, was PCR-amplified, ligated into Promega pGEM-T Easy and transformed into E. coli. <lb/>Plasmid regions containing APL_1357, APL_1358, or both genes were deleted from the pGEM-based plasmid by <lb/>inverse PCR, and the amplified fragments were blunt-end ligated to the spectinomycin resistance cassette [41] from <lb/>genomic DNA of a H. influenzae comN::spec strain [8]. Plasmids linearized with ScaI were transformed into <lb/>competent A. pleuropneumoniae HS143 and transformants were selected for spectinomycin resistance using <lb/>100µg/mL spectinomycin after 80 minutes of growth in nonselective medium. <lb/>Generation of competent stocks <lb/>To induce competence, H. influenzae and A. pleuropneumoniae were cultured in sBHI or BHI-N respectively and <lb/>transferred to competence-inducing medium MIV [42] when they reached an optical density at 600nm (OD 600 ) of <lb/>approximately 0.25 [43]. After incubation with gentle shaking at 37°C for a further 100 min (H. influenzae) or 150 <lb/>min (A. pleuropneumoniae), cells were transformed or frozen in 16% glycerol at -80 °C for later use. <lb/>Transformation assays <lb/>Transformation of MIV-competent cells: Transformation assays were carried out as described by Poje and Redfield <lb/>[43]. MIV-competent H. influenzae or A. pleuropneumoniae cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes with 1µg/ml <lb/>DNA, then DNaseI (10µg/mL) was added and cultures were incubated for 5 minutes to ensure no DNA remained in <lb/>the medium. H. influenzae cultures were transformed with MAP7 genomic DNA [44], which carries resistance genes <lb/>for multiple antibiotics, while A. pleuropneumoniae cultures were transformed with genomic DNA from an A. <lb/>pleuropneumoniae strain with spontaneous nalidixic acid resistance (generated in this lab). Cultures were diluted <lb/>and plated on both plain and antibiotic-containing plates (2.5ug/mL novobiocin for H. influenzae cultures, 20ug/mL <lb/>nalidixic acid for A. pleuropneumoniae cultures) and transformation frequencies were calculated as the ratio of <lb/>transformed (antibiotic-resistant) cells to total cells. For A. pleuropneumoniae, transformed cells were given 80 <lb/>minutes of expression time in BHI-N before plating. <lb/></body>

			<body>Time courses in rich medium: H. influenzae cells from frozen stocks of overnight cultures were diluted in fresh sBHI <lb/>and incubated with shaking at 37°C. Periodically, the OD 600 was measured, and at predetermined optical densities <lb/>aliquots of the culture were removed and transformed with MAP7 DNA and plated as described above. Bioscreen <lb/>Growth Analysis: The Bioscreen C apparatus (BioScreen Instruments Pvt. Ltd.) was used to measure growth. Cells <lb/>frozen from overnight cultures were pre-grown at low density in sBHI, and 300µL aliquots of 100-fold dilutions were <lb/>placed into 20 replicate wells of a 100-well Bioscreen plate. Wells at the edges of the plate were filled with medium <lb/>alone as controls. Cells were grown in the Bioscreen at 37°C for 18 hours with gentle shaking, and OD 600 readings <lb/>were taken every 10 minutes. Readings were corrected by subtracting the OD 600 measured for medium-only <lb/>controls, and replicates for each strain were averaged at each time point to generate growth curves. Doubling times <lb/>were calculated for each strain from the subset of time points that represents exponential growth phase, as <lb/>determined by linearity on a semi-log plot of time versus OD 600 . <lb/>Competence growth and survival time course: Cells were grown in sBHI to a density of ~2x10 8 cfu/ml (OD600 = <lb/>0.075) and transferred to MIV. After 100 min (time for maximum competence development, an aliquot of each <lb/>culture was diluted 1/10 into fresh sBHI for recovery and return to normal growth. A fraction of each culture was <lb/>incubated in a shaking water bath, and aliquots of the initial and &apos;recovery&apos; sBHI cultures were also grown and <lb/>monitored in a Bioscreen incubator. <lb/>Cyclic AMP competence induction: H. influenzae cells in sBHI were incubated with shaking to an OD 600 of <lb/>approximately 0.05. Cultures were split and 1mM cAMP was added to one half. At an OD 600 of approximately 0.3, <lb/>aliquots were transformed with MAP7 DNA and plated as described above. <lb/>Phylogenetic Analysis: A nucleotide BLAST search (discontinuous MEGABLAST) and a protein BLAST search against <lb/>translated nucleotide databases (tBLASTn) were used to identify homologs of the HI0659 and HI0660 genes [45]. <lb/>Protein sequences found by the tBLASTn search were retained for analysis if they showed greater than 60% coverage <lb/>and greater than 40% identity to the H. influenzae query sequence. For species with matching sequences in multiple <lb/>strains, the sequence from only one strain was kept. <lb/>For species in which homologs of HI0659 and HI0660 were found next to one another, amino acid sequences of <lb/>concatenated matrices were aligned by multiple-sequence alignment using MAFFT, version 7.220 [46], run from <lb/>modules within Mesquite version 3.02 [47]. The L-INS-I alignment method was used due to its superior accuracy for <lb/>small numbers of sequences. After inspection of the alignments, poorly-aligning sequences were removed from the <lb/>analysis, and alignment was repeated. <lb/>Phylogenetic trees were generated using the RAxML [48] maximum likelihood tree inference program, run via the <lb/>Zephyr package of Mesquite. For each gene, 50 search replicates were conducted, using the PROTGAMMAAUTO <lb/></body>

			<body>option to allow RAxML to automatically select the best protein evolution model to fit the data. Since these trees <lb/>were found to correspond exactly to a set of trees generated using the PROTGAMMAJTT model, this faster model <lb/>was used to generate a majority-rules consensus tree from 1000 bootstrap replicates for each gene. <lb/>Analysis of natural deletions: 181 publicly available H. influenzae genomes were downloaded from NCBI and the <lb/>Sanger centre. Genomes were re-annotated using Prokka v1.11 [49], and the pangenome was calculated using Roary <lb/>v3.5.1 [50] with a minimum blastp threshold of 75. The toxA gene cluster in the pangenome was identified by finding <lb/>the gene cluster that contained the toxA gene from Rd KW20, and the hicA cluster was identified by finding the gene <lb/>cluster that contained the hicA gene from PittAA. 2300 bp genome sequences centered on toxA and/or hicA were <lb/>extracted from all H. influenzae genomes containing recognizable toxA and/or hicB genes, and aligned by MAFFT. For <lb/>strains that lacked recognizable toxA or hicB, sequences adjacent to the genes that normally flanked each operon <lb/>were extracted. K a /K s and pairwise distance were calculated for each gene using SeqinR v 3.4-5 [51] with codon <lb/>aware gene alignments were made using Prank (v.100802). <lb/>RNA-seq analysis: <lb/>Sample Preparation: Cell cultures of H. influenzae strain Rd, ∆crp and ∆sxy derivatives, and ∆toxTA mutants were <lb/>grown in sBHI to an OD 600 of 0.2 -0.25, then transferred to MIV. Aliquots of cells were removed just prior to transfer <lb/>to MIV, and after 10, 30, and 100 minutes in MIV, and immediately mixed with Qiagen RNAprotect (#76526) to <lb/>stabilize RNA. Cells were pelleted and frozen, and RNA was later extracted from thawed pellets using the Qiagen <lb/>RNeasy Min-elute Cleanup Kit (#74204). Contaminating DNA was removed with Ambion Turbo DNase (#AM2238), <lb/>and ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Illumina Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal kit (#MRZMB126). Sequencing libraries <lb/>were prepared using TruSeq mRNA v2 library preparation kit, according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions (Illumina). <lb/>Libraries were pooled and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500, generating paired-end 100 bp reads. <lb/>Data Analysis Pipeline: FASTQ files were analysed using the FASTQC tool (Andrews, 2015) to confirm read quality. <lb/>Reads were aligned to the H. influenzae Rd KW20 reference genome sequence using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment <lb/>tool (BWA) algorithm bwa mem [52]. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package, <lb/>v.1.6.3 (Love et al., 2013). Specifically, the function DESeqDataSetFromMatrix()was used to generate a <lb/>dataset to compare reads from each mutant strain reads from the wild-type control based on their strain, sample <lb/>time point, and the interaction between the two parameters. The function DESeq() was called to determine which <lb/>genes were differentially expressed based on these parameters, using p-values adjusted for a B-H false-discovery rate <lb/>[53] of 0.1 as a cut-off to determine significance, after normalizing total read counts and variances. <lb/></body>
