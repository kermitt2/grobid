			<front>Comparison of Analytical Techniques for Thermal Stability Analysis of <lb/>β-Cyclodextrin for an Ebola Virus Infection Treatment <lb/>Mayte Murillo 2 and Robert A. Lodder 1,2 <lb/>1. Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA Email: Lodder @ g.uky.edu <lb/>2. Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA <lb/>ABSTRACT: Each New Drug Application filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must include the analytical procedures to <lb/>ensure the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug substance and drug product. The BSN389 drug product (being developed <lb/>to treat Ebola virus infections) includes beta cyclodextrin. Evidence must be provided that the analytical procedures used in testing BSN389 <lb/>meet proper standards of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility and are suitable for their intended purpose. The Bootstrap Error-<lb/>adjusted Single-Sample Technique (BEST) software was used to compare the quantitative and qualitative power of IR and 1 H NMR to <lb/>differentiate new and partially decomposed samples of beta cyclodextrin, and the best assay will be incorporated into the thermal stability <lb/>protocol for BCD. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Beta cyclodextrin, known simply as β-cyclodextrin or βCD or <lb/>BCD, is a non-reducing cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven <lb/>α-1,4-linked D-(+)-glucopyranosyl units (Figure 1). The seven <lb/>membered ring is produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. <lb/>This drug has applications not only in pharmaceuticals but also in <lb/>the food and environmental industry. Toxins can be removed <lb/>when the ring ensnares specific molecules that are targeted for <lb/>removal. BCD is also a food additive that acts as a stabilizer for <lb/>2. METHODS <lb/>Preparation of Samples <lb/>Approximately two grams of beta cyclodextrin was slightly decom-<lb/>posed thermally by putting the sample on a Pyrex dish and placing <lb/>it in a conventional oven, heating it slowly to about 232 °C at a <lb/>linear rate of about 28 °C/5 min until the white powder sample <lb/>was a slightly yellow color. <lb/>Measurements <lb/>Six separate samples of the pure and decomposed BCDs were <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>HO <lb/>HO <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>OH HO <lb/>OH O <lb/>HO <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>HO <lb/>O <lb/>HO <lb/>OH <lb/>HO <lb/>O <lb/>HO <lb/>HO <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>flavors, colors, and some vitamins. 2 BCD&apos;s estimated intake is <lb/>about 1-1.4 g/day and it is approved by the FDA. Researchers are <lb/>nowtaking known information about the cyclodextrin molecule <lb/>and using it as a carrier for chemotherapeutic cytotoxic anticancer <lb/>drugs. 3 <lb/>The analytical techniques 1 H NMR and infrared (IR) spectro--<lb/>scopy are used to measure the difference between decomposed and <lb/>stable versions of ΒCD in this research. The Bootstrap Error-<lb/>adjusted Single-sample Technique (BEST) software (see <lb/>Appendix) will then identify the best analytical method to use for <lb/>the thermal stability regulatory procedure for the drug. <lb/>1 <lb/>prepared with deuterated water. H NMR spectra were recorded on <lb/>a 500 MHz JOEL spectrometer, and processed with 16 scans <lb/>ranging from -2 to 16 ppm. These samples were then also <lb/>analyzed using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 infrared <lb/>spectrometer over a wavenumber range of 4000-500 cm -1 . <lb/>Analysis <lb/>The 1 H NMR data were entered in TopSpin and converted into <lb/>CVS files. These data along with the IR values were read into <lb/>MATLAB. Each sample set of data was linked together in a variable <lb/>with dimensions equal to the number of wavenumbers or chemical <lb/>shifts. Each set was plotted as described in Appendix 1. The BEST <lb/>program was used to determine the distance in multidimensional <lb/>standard deviations (SDs) between the set of samples of pure and <lb/>decomposed BCD. These values were then compared to the <lb/>control distances, which were found by finding the distances <lb/>between the center of the pure BCD validation spectra each pure <lb/>BCD validation spectrum. <lb/>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Characterization of ΒCD <lb/>As shown in Figure 2 and 3, the structure of BCD was <lb/>characterized by 1 H-NMR and IR spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows <lb/>the 1 H-NMR spectrum of decomposed and pure ΒCD. Results <lb/>showed only slight left shift of the decomposed sample. Figure 3 <lb/>shows a comparison of the IR spectra between the pure and <lb/>decomposed drug. The decomposed sample showed a slight blue <lb/>shift in the O-H stretch vibrations. <lb/>Figure 1. Structure of β-cyclodextrin. <lb/>HO <lb/>It is worth noting that the Mahalanobis distance between the IR <lb/>and NMR samples could not be calculated because the number of <lb/>rows of the data matrix must exceed the number of columns. The <lb/>BEST software was able to overcome this obstacle and provide a <lb/>useful result. <lb/></body>

IR spectra of ΒCD <lb/>Analysis of Techniques <lb/>Table 1 shows the standard deviations output by the BEST soft-<lb/>ware. The average values for the 1 H NMR were higher than the <lb/>average values for the IR, 6.3100 and 4.9900 respectively. This <lb/>showed the differences between the stable and decomposed sample <lb/>that are not obvious when shown graphically (Figures 2 and 3). <lb/>The controls were expected to be less than three. There were two <lb/>outliers in the NMR spectra. The outliers will be checked by LC-<lb/>MS in a follow-up study. <lb/>4. CONCLUSION <lb/>Beta cyclodextrin samples were tested by IR and NMR. Tests <lb/>showed small differences <lb/>between the pure and slightly <lb/>decomposed samples. The BEST software suggests that proton <lb/>NMR is superior for thermal stability of BCD, but the variability is <lb/>large and the outliers need to be investigated. <lb/>Table 1.
