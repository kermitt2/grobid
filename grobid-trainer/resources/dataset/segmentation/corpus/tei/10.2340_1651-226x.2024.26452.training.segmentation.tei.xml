        <body>Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a chronic, rare, <lb/>autoinflammatory skin disease characterized by wides-<lb/>pread eruption of sterile pustules with or without systemic <lb/>symptoms (1, 2). Owing to the rarity of GPP, there is a <lb/>lack of international consensus on diagnosis and manage-<lb/>ment, and a paucity of standardized global guidelines (3). <lb/>Although there are established GPP guidelines in Japan <lb/>(2), disease understanding among general dermatologists <lb/>is limited. Moreover, several pustular skin conditions <lb/>have similar clinical presentations, which contribute to <lb/>the diagnostic complexity of GPP (3). <lb/>A greater understanding of disease trajectory before <lb/>GPP diagnosis may be key to improving the timeliness <lb/>and accuracy of diagnosis, and subsequently, patient out-<lb/>comes. However, thus far, disease trajectories in patients <lb/>with GPP have not been ascertained on a population level. <lb/>Using population data from a Japanese health insurance <lb/>database, this study describes the journey of patients with <lb/>GPP and explore other diagnoses received before GPP. <lb/>Notably, the methods used in this study (Appendix S1) <lb/>may be used to mine databases from other countries. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>This retrospective cohort study used two data mining and machine-<lb/>learning models with different medical foci to evaluate anonymi-<lb/>zed claims data from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC), <lb/>from 1 January 2005 to 29 February 2020. Eligible patients with an <lb/>incident diagnosis of GPP (International Classification of Diseases <lb/>10 th Revision code L40.1) and ≥ 1 year of continuous insurance <lb/>enrolment before their index date were followed from the first <lb/>confirmed diagnosis of any disease to the first confirmed GPP <lb/>diagnosis (index date; Fig. S1); their journey before GPP diagnosis <lb/>was analyzed. This study was approved by the ethics committee of <lb/>the Nishi-Umeda Clinic for Asian Medical Collaboration, Osaka, <lb/>Japan; approval number AMC-BI-21-009. <lb/>Data were analyzed using network analysis and sequential <lb/>pattern mining. Baseline covariates, including age and sex, are <lb/>presented descriptively. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Of the 435 patients in the JMDC database with GPP <lb/>diagnosis, 189 met the inclusion criteria. The median age <lb/>was 39 (range 1-74) years and 42.9% of patients were <lb/>female (Table SI). <lb/>Overall, 31/607 diseases diagnosed before a GPP <lb/>diag nosis appeared in the network pattern with a direct <lb/>or indirect connection to GPP. Twenty-two diseases <lb/>were diagnosed in ≥ 20% of patients (Fig. 1; Table SII), <lb/>including atopic conditions (e.g. conjunctivitis and <lb/>atopic dermatitis; Table SII). Fifteen diseases were <lb/>directly linked to GPP (Fig. S2); the most common being <lb/>allergic rhinitis (53.5%), acute bronchitis (52.9%), and <lb/>acute upper respiratory tract infection (48.1%; Fig. 1). <lb/>Fig. 1.

        <body>Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) was a pre-diagnosis in 29.4% of <lb/>patients. Time to GPP diagnosis for patients with any of <lb/>the 15 diseases directly linked to GPP is shown in Fig. S3 <lb/>and Table SII. Sixty-seven sites were identified as making <lb/>pre-GPP diagnoses of interest, with clinics (any type of <lb/>clinic including but not limited to dermatology and inter-<lb/>nal general medicine) and other hospitals (any hospital that <lb/>is not a clinic, public hospital, or University hospital) the <lb/>most frequent settings (n = 38/67 [56.7%] and n = 14/67 <lb/>[20.9%], respectively (Fig. S4)). <lb/>To explore the short-term patient journey regardless of <lb/>frequency, we extracted disease diagnoses first made ≤ 120 <lb/>days before GPP diagnosis. Pre-GPP diagnoses occurring in <lb/>≥ 1% of patients included skin diseases or symptoms, and <lb/>differential diagnoses; these occurred at a relatively low <lb/>frequency (1.1-6.4%; Fig. S5). Table SIII shows diseases <lb/>that were diagnosed ≤ 120 days before GPP diagnosis. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This real-world study was the first to explore disease trajec-<lb/>tories and the pre-diagnosis history of patients with GPP. <lb/>The study identified 22 diseases diagnosed in ≥ 20% of <lb/>patients before GPP diagnosis, and highlighted direct links <lb/>between 15 diseases and GPP. Five of the 15 diseases <lb/>linked to GPP were last diagnosed ≤ 120 days before GPP <lb/>diagnosis, including PsV (known to precede GPP in some <lb/>patients (4)) and other diseases (e.g. impetigo) that often re-<lb/>present differential diagnoses for GPP. These data align with <lb/>previous research from the Japanese Society for Psoriasis <lb/>Research, reporting PsV prevalence of 31-78% among Ja-<lb/>panese, Malaysian, and Portuguese patients with GPP (4-9). <lb/>The frequency of diseases that were first diagnosed <lb/>≤ 120 days before GPP diagnosis was low, indicating that <lb/>they were minor diagnoses in the patient journey. Overall, <lb/>several skin diseases and dermatological signs/symptoms <lb/>were identified (Fig. S5) that may exhibit similar symptoms <lb/>to those of early GPP. For example, fever is common to <lb/>both cellulitis and GPP, and pustules, skin erosion, and <lb/>erythema present at initial GPP onset (2). Additionally, <lb/>patients experiencing severe itch can be mistakenly diag-<lb/>nosed with eczema. This highlights the difficulty in cor-<lb/>rectly diagnosing early GPP symptoms and the need for <lb/>dermatologists to consider differential diagnoses. A high <lb/>proportion of initial diagnoses in this study were made in <lb/>clinics including but not limited to dermatology clinics. <lb/>Unfortunately, data on the type of clinic were unavailable <lb/>for the most of these diagnoses, so the impact of derma-<lb/>tologist involvement on misdiagnosis remains unclear. <lb/>Overall, our findings highlight the challenge of accurate <lb/>GPP diagnosis, similar to the results of a US patient survey, <lb/>in which 59% of patients with GPP were misdiagnosed <lb/>before receiving a confirmed GPP diagnosis (4, 10). <lb/>The short-term patient journey to a GPP diagnosis may <lb/>include diseases that trigger GPP. Although there is some <lb/>overlap between GPP symptoms and cellulitis that may <lb/>lead to misdiagnosis (e.g. swelling, redness, and fever), <lb/>other symptoms differ; cellulitis has been reported as a <lb/>trigger for GPP (2). Pregnancy is a known trigger for GPP <lb/>and this was reflected our study, with threatened prema-<lb/>ture delivery identified ≤ 120 days before GPP diagnosis <lb/>(Table SIII). Conditions identified ≤ 120 days before GPP <lb/>diagnosis included allergic contact dermatitis and allergic <lb/>rhinoconjunctivitis, for which corticosteroids may be pres-<lb/>cribed (11, 12). As corticosteroid withdrawal is a known <lb/>trigger for GPP, the treatment, rather than the disease per <lb/>se, could be the trigger. Indeed, it was difficult to esta-<lb/>blish a relationship between diseases directly connected <lb/>to a GPP diagnosis with the onset of GPP, particularly <lb/>for patients diagnosed several months before GPP. For <lb/>example, diagnoses of myopic astigmatism and impac-<lb/>ted cerumen occurred approximately 285 and 326 days <lb/>prior to GPP diagnosis. Although there is currently no <lb/>evidence for the link between these conditions and GPP, <lb/>a potential correlation cannot be completely disregarded. <lb/>In addition, as the most common diagnoses occurring in <lb/>≥ 5% of patients during the pre-GPP diagnosis period <lb/>are relatively common conditions (allergic rhinitis, acute <lb/>bronchitis, and acute upper respiratory tract infection) it <lb/>is not easy to decipher their relevance to GPP onset. <lb/>This study included a representative sample of patients <lb/>with incident GPP diagnoses; however, external validity <lb/>may be limited due to the restriction to a single Japanese <lb/>database that includes only 4 million of ~125 million people <lb/>in Japan (13), and few individuals aged &gt; 65 years. Our study <lb/>population comprised younger patients compared with other <lb/>Japanese studies (7, 14) and a higher proportion of males <lb/>than females. While most GPP studies observe a higher <lb/>proportion of females versus males (15), a higher propor-<lb/>tion of males has been observed in other Japanese studies <lb/>(13), including one utilizing JMDC data (16). As employed <lb/>individuals comprise the majority of patients captured in the <lb/>JMDC database, older, unemployed or female patients (who <lb/>make up a large proportion of the Japanese population) may <lb/>be under-represented. There was also a potential risk of bias <lb/>due to the retrospective study design, restricting the analysis <lb/>to patients with ≥ 1 year of continuous insurance enrolment, <lb/>and relying on the quality and availability of data in the <lb/>database, all of which could have included inconsistencies <lb/>or errors. Furthermore, using the JMDC database to analyse <lb/>GPP diagnoses has not yet been validated. <lb/>This first real-world study exploring the short-and <lb/>long-term disease trajectories in patients before their GPP <lb/>diagnosis found that approximately 30% had received <lb/>a prior PsV diagnosis. Other pre-GPP diagnoses in the <lb/>patient journey may represent differential diagnoses that <lb/>clinicians need to exclude when diagnosing GPP or that <lb/>may trigger GPP. <lb/></body>
