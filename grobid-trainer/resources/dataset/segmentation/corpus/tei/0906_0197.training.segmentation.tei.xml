			<body>Strangeness photoproduction is an important tool to <lb/>gain a deeper understanding of the nature of baryon res-<lb/>onances. Theoretically, constituent quark models pre-<lb/>dict more nucleon resonances than those observed in <lb/>pion scattering reactions. Quark model studies suggest <lb/>that these missing resonances couple to strangeness chan-<lb/>nels which are not only KY (Y =Λ or Σ) but also KY * <lb/>(Y * =Λ * or Σ * ) [1]. Some nucleon resonances have been <lb/>observed at the near-threshold energies in the KY pho-<lb/>toproduction [2-4]. The threshold for the KY * photo-<lb/>production is relatively high compared with that for the <lb/>πN , ηN , and KY photoproduction. Therefore, photo-<lb/>production leading to the KY * state is a good way to <lb/>investigate poorly understood nucleon resonances with a <lb/>heavy mass. <lb/>Another physics interest in the KY * reaction is that <lb/>the bump structure found at E γ ∼2 GeV in the cross sec-<lb/>tions for the φ photoproduction [5] might be explained by <lb/>the coupled-channel or interference effects with relevant <lb/>reactions [6]. The cause of the bump has not been clar-<lb/>ified yet. Measuring cross sections and spin observables <lb/>for these relevant reactions, which have similar energy <lb/></body>

			<body>thresholds and final states, could play an important role <lb/>in clarifying the cause of the bump. The K + Λ(1520) <lb/>photoproduction is one of the best reactions to satisfy <lb/>the requirements for such a study. <lb/>The reaction mechanism of the K + Λ(1520) photopro-<lb/>duction is often described in terms of hadron exchanges, <lb/>with N and N * in the s-channel, Y and Y * in the u-<lb/>channel, and K and K * in the t-channel. Recent the-<lb/>oretical studies suggest that the contact term (to sat-<lb/>isfy the gauge invariance) is dominant and the s-channel <lb/>contribution is negligibly small in the K + Λ(1520) re-<lb/>action [7, 8]. Another theoretical study suggests that <lb/>the K * exchange contribution is small [9]. On the other <lb/>hand, previous K + Λ(1520) photoproduction data at the <lb/>center-of-mass (CM) energies (W = <lb/>√ <lb/>s) of W =2.48-3.14 <lb/>GeV (E γ =2.8-4.8 GeV) show that K * exchange in the <lb/>t-channel is dominant [10]. Recent K + Λ(1520) electro-<lb/>production data at W =1.95-2.65 GeV show that con-<lb/>tributions from K and K * exchanges are roughly equal <lb/>[11]. Therefore, additional data with new observables <lb/>are needed for solving this controversial situation. The <lb/>photon-beam asymmetry (Σ) for K + Λ(1520) photopro-<lb/>duction has some unique features. Nam et al. predict <lb/>that Σ = −1 or Σ &gt;0 if the K or K * meson is exchanged <lb/>in the t-channel, respectively [8]. The contact term, u-<lb/>channel, and s-channel N exchange contributions give al-<lb/>most zero asymmetries. Hence, a measurement of the Σ <lb/>asymmetry provides strong constraints in understanding <lb/>the K + Λ(1520) photoproduction mechanism. <lb/>In the past, experimental data for hyperon photopro-<lb/>duction at the near-threshold energies were available only <lb/>for the K + Λ and K + Σ 0 states [2-4, 12, 13]. Recently, <lb/>new experimental results for K 0 Σ + [14], K + Σ − [15], <lb/>K * 0 Σ + [16, 17], K + Λ(1405) [18], and K + Σ − (1385) [19] <lb/>have been reported. However, there are only two old pub-<lb/>lished results on K + Λ(1520) photoproduction at energies <lb/>of E γ =2.8-4.8 GeV [10] and E γ =11 GeV [20]. New ex-<lb/>perimental data near the K + Λ(1520) threshold are useful <lb/>to investigate the possibility of new nucleon resonances, <lb/>to obtain key information for clarifying the cause of the <lb/>bump found in the φ photoproduction, and to understand <lb/>the K + Λ(1520) reaction mechanism. In this Letter, we <lb/>present, for the first time, differential cross sections and <lb/>photon-beam asymmetries for the γp → K + Λ(1520) re-<lb/>action at 0.6&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;1 at the near-threshold energies. <lb/>The experiment was carried out using the laser-<lb/>electron photon facility at SPring-8 (LEPS) [21]. The <lb/>energy range of tagged photons was 1.5-2.4 GeV, and <lb/>the polarization of linearly polarized photons was 52-90% <lb/>at 1.5-2.4 GeV. We used a liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) target <lb/>with an effective length of 16 cm. Charged particles pro-<lb/>duced at the target were detected at forward angles with <lb/>the LEPS spectrometer system for trajectory tracking. <lb/>Time-of-flight information was obtained for each charged <lb/>particle track. The start signal was produced by a plastic <lb/>scintillator (SC) located behind the target, and the stop <lb/>signal was produced by an array of 40 plastic scintillators <lb/>at the downstream of the spectrometer. The K + meson <lb/>was identified from its mass, within 3σ where σ is the <lb/>momentum dependent mass resolution. The data sample <lb/>with the single K + meson was analyzed. <lb/>Figure 1 shows the missing mass (M M γK + ) spectrum <lb/>for the p( γ,K + )X reaction. The wide lower-mass peak <lb/>corresponds to the Σ 0 (1385) and Λ(1405) production, <lb/>and the narrow higher-mass peak corresponds to the <lb/>Λ(1520). The Λ(1520) yield was obtained by fitting the <lb/>peaks in the missing mass spectrum. The photon energy <lb/>region from the threshold to 2.4 GeV was divided into <lb/>15 bins and the K + polar angle region in the CM sys-<lb/>tem was divided into 4 bins. The peak shape of each <lb/>hyperon resonance was estimated by GEANT simula-<lb/>tions. Breit-Wigner shapes with masses of 1.384, 1.407, <lb/>and 1.520 GeV and widths of 36, 50, and 16 MeV were <lb/>used to generate the Σ 0 (1385), Λ(1405), and Λ(1520) <lb/>hyperon resonances, respectively [22]. The masses and <lb/>widths of the hyperon resonances are uncertain [22], and <lb/>these uncertainties were evaluated as systematic errors. <lb/>The peak shape was reproduced by the missing mass of <lb/>the p(γ,K + )X reaction in the simulations including the <lb/>experimental resolution. The peak shape was fixed in <lb/>the fit to the experimental missing mass spectrum and <lb/>the height of the peak was adjusted as a free parameter. <lb/>There is a small bump at 1.66 GeV, probably due to the <lb/>Σ 0 (1660). Since the mass and width of the Σ 0 (1660) are <lb/>not well known, the same peak shape as the Λ(1520) was <lb/>used, but with its position fixed at 1.660 GeV in the fit. <lb/>Missing Mass (GeV) <lb/>Counts <lb/>0 <lb/>2000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>6000 <lb/>8000 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>Σ <lb/>0 (1385), Λ(1405) <lb/>Λ(1520) <lb/>Σ <lb/>0 (1660) <lb/>FIG. 1: Missing mass of the p(γ,K + )X reaction at Eγ =1.5-<lb/>2.4 GeV and 0.6&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;1. The thick solid curve is the <lb/>result of the fit using the polynomial background (thin solid <lb/>curve). The dashed, dotted, and hatched curves correspond <lb/>to Σ 0 (1385)/Λ(1405), Λ(1520), and Σ 0 (1660) productions, re-<lb/>spectively. The dotted-dashed curve is the background ob-<lb/>tained by the fit using simulation curves. <lb/>The background under the hyperon peaks was fit by <lb/>using a polynomial function. The γp → K + πY , K * Y , <lb/>K + KN , and φp reactions account for the majority of the <lb/>background under the hyperon peaks in the simulation <lb/>studies. The K + πY and K * Y reactions are considered to <lb/>be dominant at M M γK + &lt;1.5 GeV, while the φp reaction <lb/>is dominant at M M γK + &gt;1.5 GeV. As a result of the fit, <lb/>the Λ(1520) yield was obtained for each incident photon <lb/>energy and angular bin. The differential cross sections <lb/>for the K + Λ(1520) reaction were obtained by using the <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>same method in Ref. [4]. <lb/>A fit with background curves generated for the γp → <lb/>K + πY , K * Y , K + KN , and φp reactions by the sim-<lb/>ulations makes a difference of at most 0.1 µb for the <lb/>K + Λ(1520) cross sections. The sum of the background <lb/>curves is shown in Fig. 1. Systematic uncertainties of <lb/>the shape, mass, and width of the Λ(1520), Λ(1405), and <lb/>Σ 0 (1385) resonances cause uncertainties of 0.04 µb at <lb/>W &lt;2.15 GeV and 0.07 µb at W &gt;2.15 GeV. Uncertain-<lb/>ties of the target thickness, photon flux, and detector <lb/>acceptance are 1%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. The π + <lb/>contamination in the particle identification of the K + is <lb/>negligibly small. When the K + is detected at forward <lb/>angles, the vertex resolution becomes poor. The contam-<lb/>ination of events from the SC in the vertex selection of <lb/>the LH 2 target is smaller than 3% at W &gt; 2.04 GeV and <lb/>smaller than 7% at W &lt;2.04 GeV. <lb/>The differential cross sections for the γp → K + Λ(1520) <lb/>reaction are shown in Fig. 2. The cross sections increase <lb/>with the CM energy near the threshold. It is quite in-<lb/>teresting that the experimental cross sections rapidly de-<lb/>crease at around W =2.2 GeV and a clear bump structure <lb/>is observed at the K + angles of 0.8&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM . The rapid <lb/>decrease at around W =2.2 GeV is much larger than the <lb/>statistical and systematic errors. This bump energy is <lb/>similar to the energy where another bump was found <lb/>in the φ photoproduction [5]. Note that the bump at <lb/>this energy is not observed in the K + Λ(1116) [4], K + Σ 0 <lb/>[4, 15], K + Σ − [15], or K + Σ − (1385) [19] cross sections <lb/>obtained using the same method. <lb/>The K + Λ(1520) cross sections are compared with the <lb/>prescaled K + Λ(1116) cross sections [3] as a function of <lb/>the excess energy in Fig. 3. The clear bump structure <lb/>found in the present K + Λ(1520) cross sections is not seen <lb/>in the forward-angle K + Λ(1116) cross sections, which <lb/>suggests that the reaction mechanism is different between <lb/>the two reactions at these near-threshold energies. <lb/>Two theoretical calculations, which are based on an <lb/>effective Lagrangian approach, by Titov et al. [23] and <lb/>Nam et al. [7] monotonically increase with the CM en-<lb/>ergy up to W ∼2.3 GeV in Fig. 2(a, b, c, d). The cal-<lb/>culations by Titov et al. are not tuned to fit the data. <lb/>The calculations by Nam et al. are dominated by the <lb/>contact term contribution. Although the results of the <lb/>calculations by Nam et al. approach the present data <lb/>by optimizing the cutoff parameter, the rapid decrease <lb/>associated with the bump cannot be reproduced. The <lb/>agreement with the present data is poor. <lb/>As one possibility, we perform new calculations to de-<lb/>scribe the present data by introducing a nucleon reso-<lb/>nance with a free mass and a width [24], although the an-<lb/>gular coverage of the data is inadequate to obtain strong <lb/>evidence for the nucleon resonance. The spins and par-<lb/>ities of J π = 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>± and 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>± for the nucleon resonance are <lb/>considered. Contributions from the nucleon resonance <lb/>with a spin higher than 3 <lb/>2 are not included due to the-<lb/>oretical ambiguities. The angular distributions of the <lb/>J π = 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>± and 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>± states are almost flat.

The <lb/>circles are the present data. The circles in the left and right <lb/>figures are the same data. The triangles are the Daresbury <lb/>data (Eγ=2.8-4.8 GeV) [10]. The solid and dashed curves <lb/>are the results of calculations fitting to the present data by <lb/>Nam et al. with and without a nucleon resonance(J π = 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+ ), <lb/>respectively [24]. The dotted-dashed curves are the results of <lb/>calculations fitting to the Daresbury data by Nam et al. [7]. <lb/>The dotted curves are the results of calculations by Titov et <lb/>al. [23]. <lb/>state gives a better reduced χ 2 (1.37) for the fit than the <lb/>other states, and the energy dependence of the bump is <lb/>reproduced by the solid curves of Fig. 2. However, the <lb/>angular distribution of the bump is not well reproduced. <lb/>The theoretical calculations estimate the cross sections <lb/>at backward K + angles to be about 0.7 µb that overesti-<lb/>mates the experimental cross sections [25] by 2-3 times. <lb/>The bump is not observed in the cross sections of the <lb/>backward K + angles [25]. <lb/>As a result of the fit, the mass and width of the <lb/>J π = 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>+ nucleon resonance are obtained as 2.11 GeV and <lb/>140 MeV, respectively.

The squares are <lb/>prescaled differential cross sections for the K + Λ(1116) reac-<lb/>tion at 0.8&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;0.9 [3]. The prescale factors of 0.263 for <lb/>(a) and 0.271 for (b) are used to fit the K + Λ(1116) cross sec-<lb/>tions to the K + Λ(1520) cross sections at 0.2 GeV&lt; ∆E &lt;0.3 <lb/>GeV. There are no K + Λ(1116) data at 0.9&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;1. <lb/>masses are D 13 (2080) with 2-star status, S 11 (2090) and <lb/>P 11 (2100) with 1-star status, and G 17 (2190) with 4-star <lb/>status in the PDG particle listings [22]. In the listings, <lb/>there is no corresponding nucleon resonance at 2.11 GeV. <lb/>Note that most of the widths measured for the nucleon <lb/>resonances in the listings are much wider than 140 MeV. <lb/>Quark model studies predict that a new J π = 5 <lb/>2 <lb/>− state <lb/>with a similar mass of 2.08 GeV may be visible in the <lb/>K + Λ(1520) reaction [1]. Theoretical improvements for <lb/>introducing a nucleon resonance with spins higher than <lb/>3 <lb/>2 are important to judge whether the bump is produced <lb/>by the nucleon resonance or not. <lb/>Another possible explanation for the bump is a new <lb/>reaction process, for example, an interference effect be-<lb/>tween the φ and Λ(1520) photoproduction reactions <lb/>might produce the bump because both reactions have <lb/>this feature in the cross sections at similar energies [5]. <lb/>Coupled-channel effects are unlikely to reproduce the <lb/>strength and the angular distribution of the bump [26]. <lb/>Typical cross sections for hyperon photoproduction, <lb/>such as K + Λ(1116) and K + Σ 0 (1193), show a gradual <lb/>decrease with increasing the CM energy [13]. A gradual <lb/>decrease in the K + Λ(1520) cross sections [10] is repro-<lb/>duced by the calculations of Nam et al. [7, 24] as shown <lb/>by all the curves of Fig. 2(e, f, g, h). Although the con-<lb/>nection between the present data and the Daresbury data <lb/>seems to be smooth at 0.7&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;0.8, the Daresbury <lb/>data at 0.8&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM are not smoothly extrapolated from <lb/>the present data as shown by the solid curves of Fig. 2(f, <lb/>g, h). The differences between the Daresbury data and <lb/>the solid curves are larger than three standard deviations <lb/>at 0.8&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM . Calculations that would agree well with <lb/>both data sets are very difficult at present. New experi-<lb/>mental data (W =2.3-2.8 GeV) are desired to fill the gap <lb/>between these two data sets. <lb/>By using vertically and horizontally polarized photon <lb/>beams, the photon-beam asymmetry has been shown to <lb/>be insensitive to the spectrometer acceptance [4, 12]. <lb/>The asymmetry (Σ) is given as P γ Σ cos 2φ = (N v − <lb/>N h )/(N v + N h ), where N v and N h are the Λ(1520) yields <lb/>with the vertically and horizontally polarized photons, <lb/>respectively. P γ is the polarization degree of the photon <lb/>beam, and φ is the K + azimuthal angle defined by the an-<lb/>gle between the reaction plane and the horizontal plane. <lb/>The photon energy region from the threshold to 2.4 GeV <lb/>was divided into 7 bins and the K + azimuthal angle re-<lb/>gion was divided into 9 bins. The K + polar angle region <lb/>was not divided. The Λ(1520) yields were obtained for <lb/>each energy and angular bin by fits to the missing mass. <lb/>Figure 4(a) shows the K + azimuthal angle distribution <lb/>of the ratio (N v − N h )/(N v + N h ) at W =2.28-2.32 GeV. <lb/>The amplitude of the fit curve was divided by P γ and the <lb/>asymmetry Σ was obtained. Systematic uncertainties of <lb/>the shape, mass, and width of the Λ(1520), Σ 0 (1385), <lb/>Λ(1405), and Σ 0 (1660) hyperon resonances cause the un-<lb/>certainty, δΣ=0.05. A fit with background curves gen-<lb/>erated for the γp → K + πY , K * Y , K + KN , and φp re-<lb/>actions by the simulations is consistent within the sta-<lb/>tistical error. The effect of the π + contamination in the <lb/>K + selection is negligible. When the K + is detected <lb/>at forward angles, the vertex resolution becomes poor. <lb/>The effect of the contamination of events from the SC in <lb/>the vertex selection of the LH 2 target is also negligible. <lb/>The attenuation of the asymmetry by the finite number <lb/>of the azimuthal angle bins (9 bins) is about δΣ=0.015. <lb/>systematic uncertainty of the measurement of the <lb/>laser polarization is δΣ=0.02. <lb/>Figure 4(b) shows the photon-beam asymmetries for <lb/>the K + Λ(1520) reaction at 0.6&lt; cos θ K <lb/>CM &lt;1 in com-<lb/>parison with those for the K + Λ(1116) reaction at <lb/>cos θ K <lb/>CM ∼0.85 [27]. The K + asymmetries are <lb/>near zero at W &lt;2.2 GeV and increase gradually with <lb/>the CM energy. The small positive values at W &gt;2.2 <lb/>GeV might indicate that the contribution from the K * <lb/>exchange is larger than that from the K exchange. The <lb/>asymmetries for the K + Λ(1520) reaction are smaller than <lb/>those for the K + Λ(1116) reaction. One reason of the <lb/>small K + Λ(1520) asymmetries is that the K * exchange <lb/>contribution may be smaller than that in the K + Λ(1116) <lb/>reaction. The contact term and K exchange contribu-<lb/>tions make the K + Λ(1520) asymmetries smaller. This <lb/>comparison suggests that the K + Λ(1520) reaction mech-<lb/>anism is different from the K + Λ(1116) reaction mecha-<lb/>nism at these near-threshold energies. <lb/>The K + Λ(1520) asymmetry data are compared with <lb/>the results of theoretical calculations by Nam et al. with <lb/>and without a nucleon resonance (J π = 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>± or 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>± ) for the <lb/>bump [24]. The calculations use the parameters obtained <lb/>from fits to the present cross sections. There is no signif-<lb/>icant difference between the results of these calculations <lb/>as shown in Fig. 4(b). Since all theoretical asymmetries <lb/>are close to zero and agree with the data at W &lt;2.2 GeV, <lb/>we cannot judge whether the bump is due to a nucleon <lb/>resonance or not. The measurement of additional spin <lb/>observables is needed to clarify the cause of the bump. <lb/>The calculations underestimate the data by 1-3 standard <lb/></body>

The parity for the res-<lb/>onances does not change the theoretical asymmetries signifi-<lb/>cantly. The result of calculations without a nucleon resonance <lb/>is almost identical to the solid curve. <lb/>deviations including the systematic uncertainties above <lb/>the bump energy. The contribution from the K * ex-<lb/>change is estimated to be larger than that obtained from <lb/>fits to just the cross section data. <lb/>In summary, we have measured differential cross sec-<lb/>tions and photon-beam asymmetries for the γp → <lb/>K + Λ(1520) reaction. A bump structure was found in <lb/>the cross sections. As one possible explanation, we in-<lb/>troduce a nucleon resonance with J ≤ 3 <lb/>2 in the theo-<lb/>retical calculations dominated by the contact term con-<lb/>tribution, although the angular coverage of our data is <lb/>inadequate to obtain strong evidence for the nucleon res-<lb/>onance. The calculations reproduce the energy depen-<lb/>dence of the bump at forward K + angles, but to <lb/>reproduce the angular distribution of the bump. Further <lb/>theoretical calculations with J ≥ 5 <lb/>2 resonances are nec-<lb/>essary to examine the presence of a nucleon resonance. <lb/>Another possible explanation is that the bump might be <lb/>produced by a new reaction process, for example an inter-<lb/>ference effect with φ photoproduction. The K + Λ(1520) <lb/>asymmetries have small positive values at W &gt;2.2 GeV, <lb/>which may indicate that the contribution from the K * <lb/>exchange is larger than that from the K exchange. The <lb/>asymmetries for the K + Λ(1520) reaction are smaller than <lb/>those for the K + Λ(1116) reaction, which confirms that <lb/>the K + Λ(1520) reaction mechanism is different from the <lb/>K + Λ(1116) reaction mechanism at these near-threshold <lb/>energies. The present result stimulates future experimen-<lb/>tal and theoretical studies for not only the KY * pho-<lb/>toproduction reaction but also other relevant reactions <lb/>with wider angular coverage, and will advance our un-<lb/>derstanding of the hadron photoproduction and baryon <lb/>resonance. <lb/></body>
