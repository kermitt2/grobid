			<front>(Continued from previous page) <lb/>Conclusions: The nucleolipids with a deoxyribose sugar moiety form small or large vesicles, rod-like structures, vesicle <lb/>aggregates or large vesicles. Some of these aggregates can be considered as intermediate forms in vesicle formation or <lb/>division. However, we could not observe nucleotide polymerization or cyclic nucleotide function of these nucleolipids, <lb/>regardless of the sugar moiety that is investigated (deoxyribose, ribose, xylose). To unravel this observation, the <lb/>chemical stability of the constructs was studied. While the nucleolipids containing β-hydroxy fatty acids are stable as <lb/>well in base as in acid circumstances, others degraded in acidic conditions. Phosphoramidate nucleolipids hydrolyzed <lb/>by P-N as well as P-O bond cleavage where the ratio between both pathways depends on the nucleobase. Diester <lb/>constructs with an α-hydroxy stearic acid degraded exclusively by hydrolysis of the 5′-O-nucleoside ester bond. <lb/>As the compounds are too stable and harsh conditions would destruct the material itself, more reactive species <lb/>such as lipid imidazolates of nucleotides need to be synthesized to further analyze the potential polymerization <lb/>process. <lb/>Keywords: Nucleolipid, Vesicles, Hydroxy fatty acids, Protocell, Chemical stability, Supramolecular assembly, <lb/>Intramolecular catalysis, Fluorescence microscopy, BODIPY, NMR stability study <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>Fatty acid vesicles are an important part of protocell <lb/>models currently studied [1,2]. As protocells can be <lb/>considered as pre-biological precursors of cells [3], the <lb/>models try to contribute to a better understanding of <lb/>the (cellular) origin of life and emphasize on 2 major as-<lb/>pects: compartmentalization and replication [2,4-6]. It <lb/>has been demonstrated that lipid-based membranes are <lb/>amenable to growth and division [1,7]. Small unilamellar <lb/>vesicles divide after micelle addition [8]. Autocatalytic <lb/>self-replicating micelles are formed from amphiphiles gen-<lb/>erated from the alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl caprylate (shell <lb/>replication) [4]. Furthermore compartmentalization cre-<lb/>ates a unique micro-environment in which biomolecules <lb/>can accumulate [9,10] and reactions can occur [11]. Pio-<lb/>neering research by Sugawara [12], Deamer [13], Luisi [4], <lb/>Szostak [7,14,15] and Rasmussen [16] gave more insight <lb/>in obtaining autocatalytic, self-replicating vesicles capable <lb/>of containing and reproducing nucleic acid sequences <lb/>(core replication). <lb/>Linking both core and shell replication is a challenging <lb/>feat requiring thorough understanding of membrane dy-<lb/>namics [7] and (auto)catalytic systems [4,17]. A possible <lb/>solution may lie in a class of compounds called nucleoli-<lb/>pids, who combine a nucleoside, nucleotide or nucleo-<lb/>base with a lipophilic moiety. Early contributions by the <lb/>group of Yanagawa [18] mentions the prebiotic signifi-<lb/>cance (as a primitive helical template) arising from the <lb/>supramolecular organization of these compounds. Fur-<lb/>ther contributions, exploring the supramolecular scope <lb/>regarding phospoliponucleosides (e.g. 5 -dioleylphospha-<lb/>tidyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine and cytidine) can <lb/>be accounted to Baglioni, Luisi and Berti. This emerging <lb/>field of amphiphiles is being investigated for surface be-<lb/>havior, supramolecular assembly and even drug ability <lb/>[19,20]. Besides improving permeability, modifying medi-<lb/>cinally active nucleosides or nucleotides with long alkyl <lb/>chains has proven (also by our group) to be an adequate <lb/>prodrug tactic [10,21]. <lb/>Now we designed of a series of nucleolipids as possible <lb/>activated precursors for obtaining oligonucleotides. Besides <lb/>its role as supramolecular recognition element ensuring <lb/>the vicinity of the nucleophilic 2′-and 3′-hydroxyl groups <lb/>and the electrophilic (activated) phosphate, it is necessary <lb/>that the lipid part of the conjugate is also a good leaving <lb/>group. This may be achieved by intramolecular catalysis; as <lb/>we have recently demonstrated that a carboxylic acid func-<lb/>tion introduced in α-position of a phosphoramidate or <lb/>phosphodiester group may help in catalyzing the cleavage <lb/>of the phosphoramidate or phosphodiester bonds. This oc-<lb/>curs by means of a cyclic intermediate that forms under <lb/>(mild) acidic conditions (Scheme 1b). One must also con-<lb/>sider the competing acidic hydrolysis (Scheme 1a) and <lb/>cleavage of the ester bond between nucleoside and phos-<lb/>phate (not depicted). Previous results have shown that the <lb/>cleavage ratio of Nucleoside-O-P and P-X-leaving group <lb/>depends on the nature of the latter bond, the leaving group <lb/>(with or without nearby carboxyl group), nucleobase and <lb/>pH (a more detailed discussion of these factors can be <lb/>found in the work of Maiti et al [22]). <lb/>Depending on the cleaved bond, this might lead to <lb/>oligonucleotide formation due to the leaving group prop-<lb/>erties of the lipid moiety or through the formation of cyc-<lb/>lic nucleotides, (e.g. 3′-5′ cyclic GMP) which are able to <lb/>polymerize in water to give short RNA fragments [23]. As <lb/>the properties of the phospholipids with and without nu-<lb/>cleoside are different, the potential of obtaining a dynamic <lb/>system is present. <lb/>Here, we have investigated the potential of α/β-hydroxy <lb/>fatty acids and α-amino fatty acids, covalently bound to <lb/>nucleoside-5′-monophosphates via a hydroxyl or an amino <lb/>group on the fatty acid (Figure 1) to spontaneous self-<lb/>assemble in spherical aggregates. Their stability towards <lb/>intramolecular cleavage was examined and thus their <lb/></body>

			<body>ability to function as (activated) monomer for oligo-<lb/>nucleotide synthesis was assessed. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Chemistry <lb/>Several types of phospholipid conjugates of nucleotides <lb/>were synthesized as represented by structure A and B <lb/>(Figure 1). A stearic acid scaffold should provide an opti-<lb/>mal balance between membrane fluidity and sufficient <lb/>permeability [2]. A nucleoside moiety consists of either a <lb/>(deoxy)ribofuranose or a xylofuranose linked to thymine <lb/>or adenine; thus creating amphiphiles with large, polar <lb/>head groups. <lb/>The (? )-α-hydroxy stearic acid 3 is prepared in two <lb/>steps from stearic acid 1 by bromination [24] using Hell-<lb/>Volhard-Zelinsky condition giving compound 2 followed <lb/>by hydrolysis in 88% overall yield (Scheme 2). The (? )-β-<lb/>Hydroxy stearic acid 8 is synthesized by the procedure <lb/>described by Masamune [25,26], which involves homolo-<lb/>gation of palmitic acid 5 [27] using in situ generated <lb/>magnesium monomethylmalonate to a preformed acyl <lb/>imidazole to produce the β-keto stearic acid methyl <lb/>ester, which is reduced [28] with sodium borohydride in <lb/>ethanol providing 7. Saponification with 1 N NaOH <lb/>resulted in the formation of (? )-β-hydroxy stearic acid 8 <lb/>in 77% overall yield (Scheme 3). <lb/>The benzyl esters of α-hydroxy stearate 4 was synthe-<lb/>sized [29] by heating α-hydroxystearic acid 3, with ben-<lb/>zyl bromide in presence of triethylamine, and catalytic <lb/>amount of TBAI in toluene for 12 h in a yield of 56%. <lb/>The benzyl ester of β-hydroxy stearate 9 is prepared in a <lb/>similar way. <lb/>The phosphoramidite approach is used for the synthesis <lb/>of the lipid-nucleotide conjugates. The phosphoramidites of <lb/>(? )-α-12 and (? )-β-hydroxy benzyl stearate 13 (Scheme 4) <lb/>were prepared by reaction of 4 and 9, respectively, with the <lb/>phosphoramidite reagent 11 (Scheme 4), which was ob-<lb/>tained by reaction of bis(diisopropylamino)chlorophosphine <lb/>[30] 10 with benzyl alcohol. <lb/>The protected 2′-deoxyadenosine 14 and adenosine <lb/>16 were prepared in a similar manner as previously de-<lb/>scribed [31,32]. Likewise, protected thymidine 15 was <lb/>prepared according to a previously reported procedure <lb/>[31,32] (Scheme 5). <lb/>The 2′, 3′-O-protected xylofuranose derivative 27 with <lb/>an adenine base moiety (Scheme 6) was prepared, starting <lb/>from commercially available diacetone-D-glucose 17. <lb/>Benzoylation of 17 was carried out using sodium hy-<lb/>dride and benzyl bromide in dry dimethylformamide. <lb/>Scheme 1 Rationale behind the design of a new series of nucleolipid containing hydroxy/amino fatty acid with a free α/β carboxyl <lb/>group.

			<body>hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd/C in THF/MeOH. <lb/>Hydrogenolysis in THF/H 2 O as solvent in the presence of <lb/>K 2 CO 3 , was carried out for the deprotection of the phos-<lb/>photriesters of the adenine derivatives (29, 35, 38, 44, 46, <lb/>and 48) to obtain phosphodiesters 30, 36, 39, 45, 47, 49. <lb/>α-(? )-Aminostearic acid 50 was synthesized based on <lb/>the method reported by Toth [37] and Porter [38], starting <lb/>from 1-bromohexadecane and diethylacetamido malonate. <lb/>The crude material was directly used for esterification to <lb/>obtain compound 50 (Schemes 8 and 9). <lb/>The synthetic protocol, used for the synthesis of the <lb/>phosphoramidates of dAMP 51 and dTMP 53 was based <lb/>on literature prescription [39,40] using dicyclohexylcar-<lb/>bodiimide (DCC) as coupling agent for the conjugation <lb/>of nucleotides and amino acid.

			<body>may lead easier to cyclic nucleoside formation than a ribo-<lb/>furanose. The availability of as well A as T nucleolipids <lb/>would allow us to study mixed vesicles, in which aggrega-<lb/>tion may be influenced by base pairing. <lb/>For studying the aggregation of the compounds, fol-<lb/>lowing 2′-deoxynucleolipids have been used: 30, 33, 39, <lb/>42, 52, and 54. The fluorescent Bodipy dyes (55, 56) <lb/>were used to monitor self-assembly of the nucleolipids <lb/>by visualization under fluorescent microscopy using a spin <lb/>coat method on the surface of a microscopic glass plate. <lb/>Vesicle formation of nucleolipids in water was facilitated <lb/>by adding small amounts of organic solvents to solubilize <lb/>respectively the dye (THF) or the nucleolipid (DMSO). <lb/>Soon after dissolving the nucleolipid by vortexing, a struc-<lb/>tural transition towards thermodynamically more stable <lb/>spherical structures is observed. Vesicular aggregations <lb/>are formed ranging from about a few to 10 μm (large vesi-<lb/>cles), depending on the dilution and solvent conditions. <lb/>Also irregular (small and large tubular structures) aggre-<lb/>gates are formed in some cases. A series of representative <lb/>examples (most frequently occurring aggregates) for the <lb/>phospholipids 30, 33, 42, 52, 54 are shown. <lb/>Figure 3 shows microphotographs of compound 30 in <lb/>H 2 O using dye 55 for visualization. Single vesicles are <lb/>formed (Figure 3a) as well as several vesicle aggregates in <lb/>which three (Figure 3b) or four (Figure 3c, d) water com-<lb/>partments are present. This could be intermediate stages <lb/>in vesicle association or vesicle dissociation. Some of them <lb/>(Figure 3d) are similar in morphology to the thread-like <lb/>vesicles [7], which are formed before division in daughter <lb/>vesicles. Figure 4 gives the images of compound 33 using <lb/>dye 56. Here, single, spherical vesicles are formed using <lb/>water-miscible organic solvents (Figure 4a, b), in water <lb/>vesicles tend to associate (Figure 4c, d). <lb/>Figure 5 is representative for the images observed <lb/>using compound 42 and dye 56. As well the vesicles <lb/>(5a, b, c) are observed as rod-like structures (5a, c) <lb/>which may be precursor structures for vesicle forma-<lb/>tion. Finally, the aggregates formed by the phospho-<lb/>ramidate conjugates with an adenine (52) and thymine <lb/>(54) base moiety were visualized using dye 56.

			<body>For studying the potential of the nucleolipids to di <lb/>(poly)merize and/or to form cyclic nucleotides, com-<lb/>pounds with a deoxyribose (30, 33, 39, 42, 52 and 54), a <lb/>ribose (36, 45) or a xylose (47, 49) sugar moiety were <lb/>envisaged. Both basic and acid circumstances were con-<lb/>sidered. Oligomerization could occur by an intermo-<lb/>lecular reaction in which the 2′-OH or 3′-OH group of <lb/>the sugar moiety attacks the 5′-O-phosphoester func-<lb/>tion, using the hydroxy (amino) lipid as leaving group. <lb/>The carboxylate group in the α-or β-position may <lb/>catalyze this reaction. Alternatively, a 3′-O, 5′-O-cyclic <lb/>nucleotide may be formed (by intramolecular reaction) <lb/>which could oligomerize in solution. During the synthe-<lb/>sis of the compounds, we already observed that some of <lb/>them are not stable in acidic medium. Therefore, all <lb/>compounds were treated in acid and in base medium <lb/>(pH4 and pH12) for a period of 48 h. However in none <lb/>of the cases, polymerization products were detected using <lb/>NMR spectroscopy. These negative results could be ex-<lb/>plained by the high chemical stability of the nucleolipids <lb/>(only starting material present) or by hydrolysis of the <lb/>compounds in acidic and/or basic medium. Therefore, we <lb/>have evaluated this stability for representative examples <lb/>(30, 33, 52, 54). <lb/>31 P NMR was used to study the stability of the nucleo-<lb/>lipids in acidic (pH4) and in base (pH12) environment. <lb/>One-dimensional 31 P spectra were used as a fast screening <lb/>experiment to monitor degradation of the conjugates. <lb/>Two-dimensional 1 H-31 P correlation spectra were used to <lb/>characterize the 31 P containing products formed by deg-<lb/>radation of the nucleolipids. Correlations were established <lb/>using a heteroTOCSY experiment with a DIPSI spinlock <lb/>of 50 ms, allowing correlations of 31 P resonances with sev-<lb/>eral 1 H resonances of adjacent spin systems. <lb/>The β-hydroxystearic acid containing nucleolipids (39, <lb/>42, 45, 49) are stable in both acidic and basic conditions <lb/>with no difference in the 31 P and 1 H NMR signals over <lb/>time at different pH s. All other compounds are stable in <lb/>basic conditions (pH = 12 in D 2 O) while degradation oc-<lb/>curs in acidic conditions. For phosphate diesters, a gel is <lb/>formed instantly upon lowering pH in water. Although <lb/>(hydro)gelation is an interesting property and promising <lb/>application of nucleolipids, this was not further investi-<lb/>gated [45]. Due to hampered NMR measurements in <lb/>aqueous conditions, sample degradation in acid medium <lb/>was monitored in DMSO. <lb/>An example NMR study on an nucleolipid diester with <lb/>α-hydroxy stearic acid is given in Figures 8 and 9 for <lb/>compound 30. Original 31 P signals appear in 1D 31 P spec-<lb/>tra between 0.1 and 0.0 ppm corresponding to Cα in R <lb/>and S enantiomers in nucleolipid 30. Due to degradation <lb/>in acidic conditions, a new 31 P signal rises slightly down-<lb/>field (0.4 ppm) while the original signals decrease. In a <lb/>2D-heteroTOCSY the original signals close to 0 ppm <lb/>correlate with protons in the spin systems of the ribose <lb/>ring (5′/5″/4′) as well as the lipid (α, β, γ). The new signal <lb/>at 0.4 ppm only correlates with protons of the lipid (α, β, <lb/>γ), indicating that the covalent bond between lipid and <lb/>phosphorus still exists after degradation. In acidic medium <lb/>(pH4-5), the thymidine congener 33 is degraded in the <lb/>same way as the adenine congener 30, which shows that <lb/>the cleavage mechanism is not dependent on the nucleo-<lb/>base (Figure 10). <lb/>Decomposition of the phosphoramidate 52 was first <lb/>studied in aqueous, acidic conditions (Figure 10). We ob-<lb/>served decrease of the original 31 P signal (7 ppm) in D 2 O <lb/>while to signals rose at 2 and 1 ppm. The latter were <lb/>assigned to dAMP and inorganic phosphate respectively <lb/>using [ 1 H, 31 P]-heteroTOCSY. Since the ratio of both new <lb/>signals is constant over time, we suggest that initial cleav-<lb/>age occurs at both amide and ester bonds in the P linkage <lb/>yielding dAMP and dA respectively. While dAMP is stable <lb/>in the reaction medium, the phosphorylated lipid rapidly <lb/>undergoes hydrolysis releasing inorganic phosphate. In <lb/>DMSO, stability of the phosphorylated lipid is increased, <lb/>making it observable as an intermediate in 1D and 2D <lb/>NMR spectra ( 31 P signal at 8.8 ppm). The H8 signals from <lb/>the nucleobases in 52, dAMP and dA are nicely resolved <lb/>and allowed to determine a ratio of 1/4 for dAMP and dA <lb/>formation:20% of adenosine monophosphate and lipid are <lb/>formed via pathway A and 80% of deoxyadenosine, inor-<lb/>ganic phosphate and lipid are formed in pathway B. The <lb/>thymine containing congener of 52 (54) also follows both <lb/>degradation pathways in acidic conditions: 53% pathway A <lb/>with formation of dTMP and lipid and 47% pathway B <lb/>with formation of thymidine, inorganic phosphate and the <lb/>lipid. Indicating that the nucleobase influences the ratio <lb/>between P-O and P-N bond cleavage. <lb/>Figure 10 Time dependent changes in 1D 31 P NMR spectrum of <lb/>nucleolipid 33 in DMSO at acidic conditions.

			<body>To summarize, among all investigated systems, only <lb/>α-amino compounds have shown the desired, however <lb/>nucleobase dependent, bond breakage upon acidifying; <lb/>the only problem being that the nucleophile is water and <lb/>not the 2 -or 3 -hydroxyl groups. The β-hydroxystearic <lb/>acid containing nucleolipids are stable in both acidic and <lb/>basic conditions. This difference between α and β deriva-<lb/>tives is analogues to previous calculations (done on a <lb/>model in which the nucleoside had been replaced by a me-<lb/>thyl group), showing that the formation of a six-membered <lb/>intermediate by the attack of the β-carboxyl group is <lb/>higher in energy (5 kcalmol-1) than the five-membered <lb/>ring formed by an α-carboxyl group [22]. The proposed <lb/>mechanism, predicting acidic instability, in Scheme 1b is <lb/>supported by the fact that only amino derivatives cleaved <lb/>at the desired bond, due to the preferred protonation of a <lb/>phosphoramidate over a phosphodiester. <lb/>Experimental <lb/>Benzyl 2-hydroxyoctadecanoate (4) <lb/>To a solution of α-hydroxy stearic acid 3 (10 g, <lb/>33.28 mmol), triethylamine (6.73 g, 9.25 ml, 66.56 mmol), <lb/>TBAI (1.23 g, 3.33 mmol) in toluene (150 mL), benzyl <lb/>bromide (5.7 g, 5.03 mL, 33.3 mmol) is added, and held at <lb/>90?

If the pH was lowered further, the emulsion ap-<lb/>peared opalescent. An aliquot of the mixture (100 μL) <lb/>was pipetted out from this reaction mixture and spin <lb/>coated at 3000 rpm on a microscope glass plate for <lb/>2 min, resulting in a thin layer adequate for optical <lb/>microscopy. <lb/>Vesicles formed in presence of Bodipy fluorescent dye <lb/>were monitored under fluorescent microscopy and the <lb/>images were recorded with Olympus Fluoview FV1000 <lb/>by carrying out excitation wavelength readings at 532 nm <lb/>with 100 ? zoom. Two fluorescent dyes were used for <lb/>the vesicle encapsulation: aqueous soluble dye 55 (sol-<lb/>uble in both water) and organic soluble dye 56 (chloro-<lb/>form/THF soluble), which were used at a concentration <lb/>of 0.5 μM. <lb/>Stability study by NMR <lb/>Samples were prepared in D 2 O or DMSO and the pD of <lb/>the sample was adjusted by the addition of a small vol-<lb/>ume (a few μL) of HCl or NaOH solutions in D 2 O <lb/>(0.1 M). 31 P NMR was used to study the stability of the <lb/>nucleolipids in acidic (pH4) and in base (pH12) environ-<lb/>ment. One-dimensional 31 P spectra were used as a fast <lb/>screening experiment to monitor degradation of the <lb/>conjugates. Two-dimensional 1 H-31 P correlation spectra <lb/>were used to characterize the 31 P containing products <lb/>formed by degradation of the nucleolipids. Correlations <lb/>were established using a Proton-detected hetero-TOCSY <lb/>experiment [24] with a DIPSI spinlock of 50 ms, allowing <lb/>correlations of 31 P resonances with several 1 H resonances <lb/>of adjacent spin systems. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>We have synthesized a series of amphiphiles in which <lb/>the polar group consists of an adenine or thymine nu-<lb/>cleotide and the lipid moiety is based on stearic acid. <lb/>The nucleolipids are constructed from a phosphodiester <lb/>or phosphoramidate bond formed between α-or β-<lb/>hydroxyl group or the α-amino group present on the lipid <lb/>moiety and the 5′-phosphate group of the nucleotide. <lb/>These molecules have been analyzed for their potential to <lb/>form vesicles in water. This can be considered as a model <lb/>of a protocell with a shell containing covalently bond <lb/>nucleotides, which may be used to establish an informa-<lb/>tion system in the vesicle by polymerization. The func-<lb/>tionalized lipid may function as leaving group for the <lb/>polymerization reaction and the α (or β) carboxylic acid <lb/>may catalyze phosphodiester cleavage. <lb/>The nucleolipids with a deoxyribose sugar moiety may <lb/>form small or large vesicles, rod-like structures or vesicle <lb/>aggregates. Some of these aggregates can be considered <lb/>as intermediate forms in vesicle formation or division. It <lb/>seems that a diversity of communication systems, by diffu-<lb/>sion (in/out the vesicle) or exchange of material between <lb/>vesicles (via vesicle fusion), between such vesicles exist. <lb/>Suggesting that a protocell could stay out of equilibrium <lb/>by diverse forms of material exchange. <lb/>However, we could not observe nucleotide polymer-<lb/>ization or cyclic nucleotide formation of these nucleoli-<lb/>pids, regardless of the sugar moiety that is investigated <lb/>(deoxyribose, ribose, xylose). To unravel this observa-<lb/>tion, the chemical stability of the constructs was stud-<lb/>ied. While the nucleolipids containing β-hydroxy fatty <lb/>acids are stable as well in base as in acid circumstances, <lb/>others degraded in acidic conditions. Phosphoramidate <lb/></body>

Diester constructs with a α-<lb/>hydroxy stearic acid degraded exclusively by hydrolysis of <lb/>the phosphorus to 5′-O-nucleoside ester. To summarize, <lb/>among all investigated systems, only α-amino compounds <lb/>have shown the desired bond breakage, the only problem <lb/>being that the nucleophile is water and not the 2 -or 3 -<lb/>hydroxyl groups. Favoring the intramolecular mechanism <lb/>in order to promote polymerization, acyclic sugar moieties <lb/>such as in GNA could be considered. Also their prebiotic <lb/>relevance makes them ideal candidates to explore proto-<lb/>cells capable of simultaneous core and shell replication <lb/>[48]. As the compounds are too stable and harsh condi-<lb/>tions would destruct the material itself, more reactive spe-<lb/>cies (such as lipid imidazolates of nucleotides) need to be <lb/>synthesized to further analyze the potential polymerization <lb/>process. This research could be based on the original work <lb/>of L. Orgel [49], in which he used phosphorimidazolate <lb/>for nucleotide polymerization. Furthermore, quantitative <lb/>investigation is in order to address the interesting (hydro) <lb/>gelating properties of these new phosphodiester nucleoli-<lb/>pids in acidic aqueous environment. <lb/> Methods <lb/>All reactions were performed in an inert atmosphere <lb/>(argon). Chemicals and solvents were purchased from <lb/>Sigma-Aldrich, TCI Europe, and Alfa Aesar, and were <lb/>used without further purification. Unless otherwise men-<lb/>tioned, each reaction vessel was oven dried prior to use. <lb/>Column chromatography was performed using silica gel <lb/>(63-200 mesh) obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Com-<lb/>pany. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was <lb/>performed on Merck pre-coated aluminum plates (silica <lb/>gel 60, F 254 ) and visualized under 254-nm UV light. 1 H, <lb/>31 P and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker <lb/>300 MHz and Bruker 500 MHz instrument at ambient <lb/>temperature in CDCl 3 -d3, MeOD-d4, D 2 O and DMSO-<lb/>d6. Chemical shifts are reported as values in parts per <lb/>million (ppm) downfield from internal standard tetra-<lb/>methylsilane (δ = 0.0 ppm) from the residual solvent sig-<lb/>nal. Splitting patterns are designated as follows: s, singlet; <lb/>d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; dd, doublet of doublet; <lb/>br, broad peak. NMR signal assignment of sugar protons <lb/>and carbons are numbered with a prime. 31 P NMR chem-<lb/>ical shifts are referenced to an external 85% H 3 PO 4 stand-<lb/>ard (d =0.000 ppm). Mass spectra were performed on a <lb/>Hewlett Packard MALDI-TOF spectrometer. Fluorescent <lb/>microscopy images were recorded by Olympus Fluoview <lb/>FV 1000 spectrometry. <lb/></body>
