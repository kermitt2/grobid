Lastly, <lb/>pRuNA is an efficient database pruning service; <lb/>which given a query RNA, eliminates a significant <lb/>portion of an ncRNA database and returns only <lb/>a few ncRNAs as potential regulators. taveRNA is <lb/>available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Until recently RNA was thought to have only two <lb/>functions: (i) primarily as an information transmitter <lb/>between DNA and proteins in the form of a messenger <lb/>RNA (mRNA) and (ii) as a catalyser or an information <lb/>decoder in protein synthesis in the form of a ribosomal <lb/>RNA (rRNA) or a transfer RNA (tRNA). The discovery <lb/>that RNA molecules can regulate gene expression <lb/>completely altered this simplistic picture (1). This impor-<lb/>tant discovery, in particular the discovery of RNA <lb/>interference (RNAi), the post-transcriptional silencing of <lb/>gene expression via interactions between mRNAs and <lb/>their antisense RNAs (by A. Fire and C. Mello) was <lb/>awarded with the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or <lb/>Medicine. <lb/>Recent studies have revealed that antisense RNAs are <lb/>only a very small subset of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). <lb/>A large fraction of the genome sequence (up to 10% in the <lb/>human genome) appears to give rise to RNA transcripts <lb/>that do not code for proteins (2). The functionality of <lb/>many such ncRNAs are only scarcely known. <lb/>Regulatory ncRNAs that are generally responsible for <lb/>regulating gene expression exhibit an exact or partial <lb/>complementarity to their target mRNAs. Their interac-<lb/>tion forms a complex that consists of several non-<lb/>contiguous helical segments which prevent ribosomal <lb/>access to the target mRNA. Generally, regulatory <lb/>ncRNAs contain one or more stem loop structures that <lb/>are (almost) complementary to specific sequences in the <lb/>target mRNAs. Interaction with a target RNA is either <lb/>initiated at such a loop structure of the antisense RNA <lb/>and a loop structure from the target (forming kissing loop <lb/>pairs) or between a loop structure and a single-stranded <lb/>segment of the complementary RNA. <lb/>As the number of ncRNAs and in particular regulatory <lb/>RNAs increase it has become of crucial importance to <lb/>establish software tools that can help identify their <lb/>functionality. For this purpose we introduce taveRNA, <lb/>a web-based computational tool set that can help identify <lb/>structure and functionality of ncRNA molecules. <lb/>taveRNA involves tools whose algorithmic foundations <lb/>were developed by Simon Fraser University&apos;s Lab for <lb/>Computational Biology over the past few years. The tools <lb/>aim to solve the following key problems: <lb/>1. RNA secondary structure prediction problem, which <lb/>asks to compute all basepairs established by a given <lb/>(nc)RNA sequence. <lb/>2. RNA-RNA interaction prediction problem, which <lb/>asks to predict the joint secondary structure between <lb/>two given RNA sequences; a joint secondary <lb/>structure between two RNAs can be represented <lb/>via the set of internal and external base pairs <lb/>established between the interacting RNAs. <lb/>3. ncRNA search problem which asks to compute all <lb/>ncRNAs that can establish stable secondary struc-<lb/>tures (and in principle play a role in the regulation <lb/>of) with a given query mRNA. <lb/>taveRNA involves web interfaces to the algorithmic <lb/>tools we have developed for each one of the above <lb/>problems: (1) alteRNA, an alternative thermodynamic <lb/>model-based RNA secondary structure prediction <lb/></body>

			<body>program, (2) inteRNA, a program for predicting the joint <lb/>secondary structure of two interacting RNAs and <lb/>(3) pRuNA, a tool for quickly identifying all potential <lb/>regulatory ncRNAs for a query mRNA. <lb/>RNA secondary structure prediction is one of the earliest <lb/>problems considered in computational biology. Despite <lb/>a 30-year-effort towards its solution, the best algorithms <lb/>and software for RNA structure prediction are still far <lb/>from perfect. The most common approach to the RNA <lb/>secondary structure prediction problem is the standard <lb/>thermodynamic approach. This general methodology <lb/>suggests to compute the secondary structure of an RNA <lb/>molecule by minimizing the total free energy of its <lb/>substructures such as stems, loops and bulges. alteRNA is <lb/>an alternative thermodynamic approach to the RNA <lb/>secondary structure prediction problem, which aims <lb/>to minimize a linear combination of total free energy and <lb/>total energy density using the dynamic programming <lb/>formulation proposed in (3), in contrast to the available <lb/>alternatives such as Mfold (4), RNAscf (5) and alifold <lb/>(6), which all employ the standard thermodynamic <lb/>approach. <lb/>As mentioned earlier, there are a number of algorithms <lb/>for predicting the secondary structure of a single RNA <lb/>molecule. However, until recently no such algorithm <lb/>existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure <lb/>of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the <lb/>stability of such a joint structure. At SFU Lab for <lb/>Computational Biology, we developed inteRNA the first <lb/>program that aims to compute the joint structure <lb/>prediction of two given RNA sequences through <lb/>minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of <lb/>the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic <lb/>foundations of inteRNA were introduced in (7). <lb/>inteRNA aims to minimize the joint free energy under <lb/>a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our <lb/>default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair <lb/>energies given by Mathews et al. (8)-the free energy <lb/>model employed by Mfold. Because there is very little <lb/>thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in <lb/>the literature, inteRNA employs the approach used by <lb/>Rivas and Eddy (9) to differentiate the thermodynamic <lb/>parameters of &apos;external&apos; bonds from the &apos;internal&apos; bonds, <lb/>i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with <lb/>a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default <lb/>algorithmic engine used by inteRNA requires substantial <lb/>resources in terms of running time and memory which <lb/>could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of <lb/>sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an <lb/>alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture <lb/>the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This <lb/>heuristic approach is based on the observation that the <lb/>substructures that are available independently in each <lb/>RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary <lb/>structure. <lb/>Regulatory ncRNAs play important roles in controlling <lb/>gene expression via establishing stable joint structures <lb/>with target mRNAs and prohibiting ribosomal access. <lb/>As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being <lb/>discovered, the determination of the exact functionality <lb/>of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant <lb/>scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. <lb/>Our software tool pRuNA is developed for helping to <lb/>address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential <lb/>regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint <lb/>structures with a query mRNA (10). An important <lb/>component of pRuNA is a sequence filter which eliminates <lb/>a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection <lb/>and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for <lb/>forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. <lb/>We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only <lb/>partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. <lb/>Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) <lb/>motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to <lb/>the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs <lb/>(11). Thus pRuNA first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs <lb/>from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary <lb/>to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the <lb/>query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif <lb/>pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use <lb/>of inteRNA and those which can establish stable joint <lb/>structures are returned by the program. <lb/>alteRNA: AN RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURE <lb/>PREDICTION TOOL BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE <lb/>THERMODYNAMIC APPROACH <lb/>Input and output <lb/>alteRNA requires a sequence in FASTA format, where the <lb/>sequence is represented as a string of characters from <lb/>the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} (the characters are case <lb/>insensitive). The length of the input RNA sequence is <lb/>limited by 500 nt. There are two user-specified parameters, <lb/>s and b, which will be explained in detail later. <lb/>alteRNA outputs the results in three different forms: <lb/>1. The predicted RNA structure in dot-parenthesis <lb/>format. The sequence is given from 5 0 to 3 0 end, <lb/>and the structure is given with matching parenthesis <lb/>denoting a base pair and a dot denoting an <lb/>unbounded base. <lb/>2. The predicted RNA structure in Connect(.ct) file <lb/>format, which is the standard Mfold output format. <lb/>The sequence length is given in the first line. <lb/>For each nucleotide i, there is a line which consists <lb/>of: the line number (i), the letter denotion of the <lb/>nucleotide, the predecessor base index (i À 1), the <lb/>successor base index (i þ 1), the paired base index <lb/>(0 if unpaired) and the original base index (i). <lb/>3. The graphics files for the predicted secondary <lb/>structure in Postscript(.ps) and GIF format. These <lb/>graphs are created using NAVIEW (12) and Mfold/ <lb/>plt2. <lb/>The secondary structure predicted by alteRNA for <lb/>5sRNA is shown in Figure 1a. <lb/>Methods <lb/>It has been shown in (3) that delocalizing the thermo-<lb/>dynamic cost of forming an RNA substructure can be <lb/>achieved by consideration of the energy density of the <lb/></body>

			<body>substructure, which, in return, can improve the secondary <lb/>structure prediction of several ncRNA families. <lb/>This alternative thermodynamic approach which we call <lb/>Densityfold (3) aims to minimize the linear combination <lb/>of the total free energy and total energy density of all <lb/>substructures in the RNA molecule. Given an RNA <lb/>secondary structure, the energy density of a basepair is <lb/>defined as the free energy of the substructure that starts <lb/>with the basepair, normalized by the length of the <lb/>underlying sequence. The energy density of an unpaired <lb/>base is then defined to be the energy density of the closest <lb/>basepair that encloses it. Densityfold thus aims to <lb/>minimize ED(n) þ sÁE(n), where ED(n) is the total energy <lb/>density of paired and unpaired bases, E(n) is the total free <lb/>energy and n is the length of the RNA sequence. Here s <lb/>determines the weight of the contribution of the total free <lb/>energy in the optimization function. As s approaches to <lb/>1, the predicted secondary structure gets closer to that <lb/>implied by the standard thermodynamic approach <lb/>(employed by Mfold). We have observed that s ¼ 5 <lb/>generally gives the most accurate prediction, in terms of <lb/>structure edit distance (13), however in some RNA <lb/>sequences, different s values can outperform s ¼ 5. <lb/>We note that the free energy of a multi-branch loop <lb/>as implied by the standard thermodynamic model is not <lb/>a linear function and as a result cannot be used in <lb/>a dynamic programming formulation. Thus we use the <lb/>same approximate formulation as per Mfold, which, for <lb/>a given multi-branch loop, L sets: <lb/>GðLÞ ¼ a þ b Á l s ðLÞ þ c Á l d ðLÞ þ G stack <lb/>Here a, b, c are constants in thermodynamic model, l s is <lb/>the number of unpaired bases, l d is the number of base <lb/>pairs and ddG stack is the free energy of each branch in the <lb/>loop. The default setting for b, the coefficient for the <lb/>number unpaired bases, is 0 in Mfold; this implies <lb/>that there will be no penalty for the unpaired bases. <lb/>However, when used with Densityfold, this setting seems <lb/>to produce large stretches of unpaired bases in multi-<lb/>branch loops. In order to counter this effect we suggest the <lb/>user to set b to a small positive value less than 1. alteRNA, <lb/>our web-based tool for RNA secondary structure predic-<lb/>tion via the Densityfold approach allows the user to <lb/>specify any positive value for s and b. The default values <lb/>of s and b are 5 and 0, respectively and the folding <lb/>temperature is fixed at 378C. <lb/>inteRNA: A Web-Based Tool For RNA-RNA <lb/>Interaction Prediction <lb/>Input and output <lb/>inteRNA requires as an input two RNA sequences in <lb/>FASTA format. The sequences are represented as strings <lb/>of characters from the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} <lb/>(the strings are case insensitive). The length of each <lb/>input RNA sequence is limited by 150 nt for Stacked Pair <lb/>Model and by 500 nt for Loop Models. There are three <lb/>user-specified parameters; gap penalty, maximum <lb/>subsequence length and energy model; each of these <lb/>parameters are explained in detail later. <lb/>inteRNA reports the results in three different output <lb/>forms: <lb/>1. A text file that contains the base-pair information of <lb/>the joint secondary structure. Here, each line denotes <lb/>either a base pair with nucleotide indices or a gap. <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>A base pair is represented by a quadruple (Sequence, <lb/>Position, Sequence, Position), where Sequence can be <lb/>either S or R (representing the first and the second <lb/>sequences, respectively) and Position is the base <lb/>index. Gaps are represented with (S,&apos;&apos;Gap&apos;&apos;,R,i) in <lb/>sequence R and represented with (S,i,R,&apos;&apos;Gap&apos;&apos;) in <lb/>sequence S, where i is the index of the free <lb/>nucleotide. <lb/>2. A JPEG image file that can help visualize the joint <lb/>secondary structure prediction of the input RNAs. <lb/>The input RNAs are represented by their sequences <lb/>only. Internal bonds are represented by blue arcs and <lb/>external bonds are represented by red lines. <lb/>3. A text file reporting the calculated free energy of the <lb/>predicted joint secondary structure. <lb/>A sample interaction between CopA and CopT, <lb/>predicted by inteRNA is shown in Figure 1b. <lb/>Method <lb/>inteRNA uses a dynamic programming algorithm, which <lb/>aims to predict the joint secondary structure of two <lb/>interacting RNA molecules through minimizing their total <lb/>free energy. In other words, it predicts the secondary <lb/>structure of both RNA strands and the interaction <lb/>simultaneously. Since the general joint structure predic-<lb/>tion problem is NP-Complete, it is necessary to set some <lb/>limitations on the structures predicted: inteRNA does not <lb/>allow any (internal or external) pseudoknots; it does not <lb/>allow any zig-zag structures either (7). <lb/>inteRNA can employ the following two models for <lb/>approximating the total free energy of the joint structure. <lb/>Stacked pair model: This model uses stacking pair <lb/>energy functions both externally and internally. A gap <lb/>penalty parameter is used to penalize opening a gap. Due <lb/>to high computational complexity and memory require-<lb/>ments of this model, inteRNA cannot accept inputs with <lb/>large (4200 nt) sequence lengths with this setting. <lb/>Loop model: It has been observed that RNA molecules <lb/>mostly preserve their independent secondary structure <lb/>when they interact with other RNA. Interactions thus <lb/>typically occur between kissing hairpin loops. The loop <lb/>model first predicts the secondary structure of each RNA <lb/>sequence independently using three different approaches: <lb/>(i) through the standard thermodynamic model (Mfold <lb/>Loop Model), (ii) through Stacked Pair Model using <lb/>a single RNA sequence (Default Loop Model) and <lb/>(iii) through alteRNA (alteRNA Loop Model). It then <lb/>identifies all independent subsequences of each RNA <lb/>structure: these are substructures (each implied by <lb/>a basepair) whose sequence length is less than a specified <lb/>value. It then computes the joint secondary structure that <lb/>can be established between each pair of independent <lb/>subsequences (one subsequence from each RNA) and the <lb/>free energy of this joint structure. Finally, it finds the set of <lb/>independent subsequence pairs which can co-exist and <lb/>minimize the total free energy of the overall secondary <lb/>structure. <lb/>pRuNA: A REGULATORY RNA SEARCH ENGINE <lb/>Input and output <lb/>pRuNA asks for a query mRNA sequence as well as its <lb/>corresponding secondary structure in parenthesis format. <lb/>It returns a list of possible regulating ncRNAs available <lb/>through the Rfam database (14). <lb/>Method <lb/>At the heart of pRuNA we have a lookup table of size <lb/>1024 Â 1024, which represents every possible pair of 5-mer <lb/>motifs from the 4-letter RNA alphabet. Each entry in the <lb/>lookup table maintains a pointer to every occurrence of <lb/>the respective 5-mer motif pair in the loop sequences of the <lb/>ncRNA structures in the Rfam database. For querying the <lb/>index, pRuNA first identifies the loop sequences from <lb/>the mRNA, based on the given secondary structure <lb/>information. It then extracts each pair of non-overlapping <lb/>5-mer motifs from the mRNA loop sequences and checks <lb/>the lookup table for its reverse complement. The union of <lb/>the set of ncRNAs that include each motif pair are <lb/>retained by pRuNA, whereas the remainder of the <lb/>ncRNAs in the database are eliminated. We have observed <lb/>that many of the motif pairs in the lookup table occur very <lb/>frequently in ncRNA sequences and thus have limited <lb/>information content. We omitted the 5-mer pairs which <lb/>occur in more than the number (14) of ncRNAs that <lb/>include a &apos;typical&apos; motif pair. This increased our pruning <lb/>efficiency substantially yet had no effect on the quality of <lb/>the results: we have tested pRuNA mRNAs that are <lb/>known to be regulated by an ncRNA available through <lb/>the NPInter database (15). For all 24 of these mRNAs, <lb/>pRuNA was able to return the known regulatory <lb/>ncRNA among the set of potential regulators, while <lb/>achieving a pruning efficiency of 86% on the average. <lb/>If the search is restricted to E. coli ncRNAs, the pruning <lb/>efficiency for the 22 mRNAs regulated by these ncRNAs <lb/>go up to 91% on the average. Further details on pRuNA <lb/>(including the method and experimental results) can be <lb/>found in (10). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>taveRNA is a web application implemented in html/php; <lb/>the underlying algorithms are all implemented in C/Cþþ. <lb/>Our server is hosted on a Linux machine with 16 GB <lb/>RAM and 4 AMD Opteron 2200 processors. On an RNA <lb/>sequence with length n, the running time of alteRNA is <lb/>O(n 4 ) and the memory requirement is O(n 4 ). On two input <lb/>RNA sequences S and R, where |S| ¼ n and |R| ¼ m, the <lb/>running time of inteRNA is O(n 3 m 3 ) and the memory <lb/>requirement is O(n 2 m 2 ). It is possible to improve the <lb/>running time using the loop model to where k is the <lb/>maximum independent structure size. The running time of <lb/>pRuNA is linear with the input sequence length and the <lb/>result set. Because of the large running-time requirements <lb/>of inteRNA and alteRNA, taveRNA has an e-mail <lb/>notification option. <lb/>taveRNA has been developed by the Lab for <lb/>Computational Biology at Simon Fraser University and <lb/></body>
