Smoking <lb/>during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research <lb/>on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of <lb/>pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome. <lb/>Methods: This analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of <lb/>18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low <lb/>birthweight (&lt;2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (&lt;37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate <lb/>the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were <lb/>used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs). <lb/>Results: 43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during <lb/>pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce <lb/>the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and <lb/>prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AOR LBW 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AOR PREM 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), <lb/>independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before <lb/>pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AOR LBW 1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit <lb/>or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third <lb/>(AOR LBW 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were <lb/>found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% <lb/>of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided. <lb/>Conclusions: Planning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits <lb/>for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight. <lb/>Keywords: Pregnancy planning, Smoking, Low birthweight, Prematurity <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>Pre-pregnancy health and care are important for the health <lb/>of future generations. Growing evidence about the &apos;fetal ori-<lb/>gins of adult disease&apos; [1] and from the field of epigenetics <lb/>[2] indicate the large potential benefits of preconception <lb/>and inter-conception care for both women and men. The <lb/>life course approach to disease highlights the importance of <lb/>the intrauterine environment in preventing future disease <lb/>and the preconception period is seen as a critical period <lb/>where intervention can lead to long term benefit [3]. The <lb/>National Health Service (NHS) offers a range of guidance <lb/>to women hoping to become pregnant [4]. Avoiding behav-<lb/>iour that can be detrimental to health such as smoking dur-<lb/>ing pregnancy are highlighted in the NHS&apos;s guidance. This <lb/>is because smoking in pregnancy has a clear adverse impact <lb/>on neonatal outcome, including preterm delivery, low birth <lb/>weight, [5-7] still birth and up to 40% increased risk of <lb/>infant mortality [8]. The National Institute for Health and <lb/>Care Excellence (NICE) [9] offers public health guidance to <lb/></body>

			<body>health professionals for interventions to help women <lb/>and partners to quit smoking including carbon monoxide <lb/>testing and referral to smoking cessation services. <lb/>The NHS guidance also gives advice on how long it is <lb/>expected for a woman to become pregnant and what op-<lb/>tions there are for fertility treatment if there are difficulties <lb/>in becoming pregnant [4]. But there is no information on <lb/>the health impact of pregnancy planning itself, reflecting <lb/>the fact that there has been little research on decisions <lb/>made by a woman before pregnancy and how that affects <lb/>health related behaviours and the health of the child. Such <lb/>information is important if interventions to improve <lb/>neonatal outcome by preparing for pregnancy are to be <lb/>initiated, and these interventions may need to be targeted <lb/>towards particular groups who are less likely to plan <lb/>for pregnancy. <lb/>This study uses Millennium cohort data to examine the <lb/>independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking <lb/>during pregnancy on neonatal outcome. Specific objectives <lb/>were to (i) examine the association between planning <lb/>and smoking status, and (ii) examine the independent <lb/>effects of pregnancy planning and smoking status on <lb/>neonatal outcome, and (iii) estimate the proportion of <lb/>adverse neonatal outcome that could be avoided in the <lb/>population if all mothers planned their pregnancies <lb/>and / or avoided smoking in pregnancy. <lb/>Methods <lb/>The millennium cohort study <lb/>The MCS is a nationally representative cohort study <lb/>conducted by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the <lb/>Institute of Education, London (http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/), <lb/>that follows the lives of over 18,819 babies born through-<lb/>out Great Britain and Northern Ireland between 2000 and <lb/>[10] a&amp;b. The MCS first collected information on <lb/>the babies and their families from their two main carers <lb/>(most commonly their mother and father) when the ba-<lb/>bies were around nine months old. The MCS attained an <lb/>overall response rate of 68% throughout the whole of the <lb/>UK [10] a&amp;b. As part of the survey design the MCS over-<lb/>sampled in areas with high child poverty and in England <lb/>also in areas with increased prevalence of ethnic minority <lb/>populations [10] b. <lb/>Pregnancy planning and smoking in pregnancy <lb/>The two main exposure variables were pregnancy planning <lb/>and smoking status, which were asked about at the first <lb/>interview when the child was 9 months of age. Pregnancy <lb/>planning information came from the question to the <lb/>mother &quot;Were you planning to get pregnant or was it a <lb/>surprise?&quot; Women were grouped into those who planned, <lb/>and those who did not plan, the pregnancy. Smoking status <lb/>during pregnancy came from questions about current and <lb/>past smoking, including the question &quot;How many cigarettes <lb/>a day were you usually smoking just before you became <lb/>pregnant?&quot; and &quot;Did you change the amount you smoked <lb/>during your pregnancy?&quot; All women who reported a change <lb/>had a reduction in the amount smoked. Women were <lb/>classified as smokers just before pregnancy if they re-<lb/>ported 1 or more cigarettes per day. For the analysis, <lb/>four categories of smoking status during pregnancy were: (i) <lb/>never-smoker; (ii) ex-smoker (given up before pregnancy); <lb/>(iii) smoker just before pregnancy and had either quit smok-<lb/>ing or had reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy; <lb/>and (iv) smoker just before pregnancy and continued to <lb/>smoke the same amount during pregnancy (no change). <lb/>Neonatal outcome <lb/>The outcome variables were low birthweight (less than <lb/>2.5 Kg or 2.5 Kg and above) and pre-term birth (&lt;37 com-<lb/>pleted weeks or 37 or more completed weeks gestation). <lb/>Study population <lb/>This analysis investigated singleton births only. Records <lb/>of babies from multiple births and corresponding carer <lb/>information were dropped from the analysis (n = 522). A <lb/>further 18 records were dropped from the analysis because <lb/>the respondents were not immediate family members. 100 <lb/>records had missing information on pregnancy planning, <lb/>and 816 records had missing smoking information, leaving <lb/>a total of 18,178 records with planning information and <lb/>17,462 records with smoking information. Further records <lb/>(less than 145) with missing data on socio-economic <lb/>characteristics and neonatal outcome were dropped from <lb/>analyses, as appropriate: the numbers in each analysis are <lb/>presented in the tables. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Data for this analysis were taken from the first sweep only, <lb/>accessed through the Economic and Social Data Service <lb/>(http://www.esds.ac.uk/). All analyses used the statistical <lb/>software package STATA, version 11. The survey design, <lb/>oversampling and response rate were accounted for using <lb/>the svyset command (and subsequent svy commands) <lb/>in STATA using specific countrywide variables that had <lb/>already been created. <lb/>Socio-demographic characteristics and the health status <lb/>of women who planned, and did not plan, the index <lb/>pregnancy were compared using descriptive tabulations <lb/>and Chi square tests. Similar comparisons were made for <lb/>women in the four smoking groups. <lb/>Univariable logistic regression was used to investigate <lb/>the association between pregnancy planning, or smoking <lb/>status, and neonatal outcome. Multivariable analysis was <lb/>then conducted, including confounding variables in the <lb/>model if they were associated with the outcome at a 5% <lb/>level after adjustment for other factors in the model.

			<body>was investigated using Likelihood Ratio Tests (ignoring the <lb/>SVY command). If no interaction was detected (p &gt; 0.05) <lb/>further adjustment was made for smoking status or <lb/>planning, as appropriate. <lb/>Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PAFs) <lb/>were used to assess the independent impact of pregnancy <lb/>planning and smoking on low birthweight and preterm <lb/>delivery in this population. PAFs were computed using <lb/>for formula: <lb/>PAF % <lb/>ð Þ <lb/>¼ <lb/>p AOR-1 <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ <lb/>P AOR-1 <lb/>ð <lb/>Þþ1 <lb/>x 100 <lb/>Where: p = proportion of population who did not plan <lb/>their pregnancies/ or who smoked around the time of <lb/>pregnancy, and AOR = Adjusted odds ratio. <lb/>PAFs to estimate the joint impact of pregnancy planning <lb/>and smoking were calculated using the method described <lb/>in Bruzzi et all, 1985 [11]. <lb/>Results <lb/>Characteristics of the study population by planning and <lb/>smoking status <lb/>Overall, 57% (10,405/18,178) of mothers of singleton births <lb/>reported that they planned the pregnancy (Additional file 1: <lb/>Table S1). Compared to planners, non-planners were <lb/>younger and left school at an earlier age, were more likely <lb/>to be classified as deprived, and less likely to be married <lb/>and to have White ethnicity. The babies who were not <lb/>planned were of higher birth order than babies who were <lb/>planned and there was some indication that mothers who <lb/>reported not planning their pregnancy were more likely to <lb/>be underweight before pregnancy than women who did <lb/>plan (Additional file 1: Table S1). <lb/>Fifty four percent (9,370/17,462) of mothers had never <lb/>smoked and 12% (n = 2,071) were ex-smokers. Thirty four <lb/>percent were smokers just before the pregnancy and, of <lb/>these, 81% quit or decreased the amount they smoked <lb/>during the course of the pregnancy (Additional file 2: <lb/>Table S2). Compared to the non-smokers, smokers were <lb/>younger and left school at an earlier age, were more <lb/>likely to be classified as deprived, and less likely to be <lb/>married. Again, there was some evidence that mothers <lb/>who smoked around the time of the pregnancy were <lb/>more likely to be underweight before pregnancy than <lb/>women who did not smoke. Babies of mothers who con-<lb/>tinued to smoke in pregnancy had higher birth order <lb/>than babies born to mothers in the other three smoking <lb/>groups (Additional file 2: Table S2). <lb/>Association between smoking and planning a pregnancy <lb/>There was a clear association between planning a pregnancy <lb/>and not smoking just before pregnancy (p &lt; 0.001, Table 1). <lb/>Of the planners, 62% were never smokers, 12% ex-smokers <lb/>and 26% were smoking just before pregnancy. The cor-<lb/>responding figures for mothers who did not plan their <lb/>pregnancy were 46% never-smokers, 7% ex-smokers and <lb/>47% smoking just before pregnancy. Of those smoking <lb/>just before pregnancy, 84% of the planners and 77% of the <lb/>non-planners either quit smoking or reduced the amount <lb/>they smoked in pregnancy (Table 1). <lb/>Association between pregnancy planning, smoking in <lb/>pregnancy, and neonatal outcome <lb/>Overall, 6% (1,102/18,178) of babies in the study population <lb/>were born with low birthweight and 7% (n = 1,279) were <lb/>born preterm. <lb/>Pregnancy planning <lb/>The proportion of low birthweight babies was lower <lb/>for mothers who planned their pregnancy (5.2%) than <lb/>for mothers who did not plan (7.2%). After adjusting <lb/>for socio-demographic confounding factors (see table <lb/>footnotes for details of adjustment factors) there was a <lb/>statistically significant 27% increased odds of low birth-<lb/>weight for the children of mothers who did not plan com-<lb/>pared to those who did (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.51) <lb/>(Table 2). No effect modification between pregnancy <lb/>planning and smoking was detected (p &gt; 0.05). After <lb/>further adjustment for smoking status, effect of planning <lb/>reduced slightly to 24% increased odds (AOR 1.24, 95% CI <lb/>1.04-1.48), remaining statistically significant. Similarly, <lb/>6.3% of children whose mothers planned their pregnancy <lb/>were born prematurely, compared to 8.2% of children <lb/>whose mothers did not, with adjusted odds ratios showing <lb/>24% increased odds of prematurity associated with non-<lb/>planning (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45). <lb/>Smoking <lb/>The proportion of babies with low birthweight was higher <lb/>for mothers who smoked just before pregnancy (8.3%) <lb/>than for those who did not (5.0%). After adjustment for <lb/>socio-demographic factors (see table footnotes for details) <lb/>and pregnancy planning (no effect modification between <lb/>smoking and pregnancy planning detected, p &gt; 0.05), there <lb/>was a statistically significant 91% increased odds of low <lb/>birthweight associated with smoking before pregnancy <lb/>(AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34) (Table 3). A smaller ef-<lb/>fect was seen for prematurity, the adjusted odds ratio <lb/>showing 12% increased odds associated with smoking <lb/>(AOR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95-1.35). <lb/>Further analysis of neonatal outcome for the children <lb/>of mothers who reported smoking just before pregnancy <lb/>showed that those mothers who quit or decreased the <lb/>amount smoked during pregnancy had a lower proportion <lb/>of low birthweight babies (7.6%) compared to mothers <lb/>who continued to smoke the same amount in preg-<lb/>nancy (11.5%). After adjustment for confounding factors, <lb/></body>

			<body>including pregnancy planning, the odds of low birthweight <lb/>for babies born to mothers who changed their smoking <lb/>habits during pregnancy were reduced by 34% (AOR 0.66, <lb/>95% CI 0.51-0.85) (Table 4). A smaller and non-statistically <lb/>significant effect of quitting or decreasing the amount <lb/>smoked during pregnancy was seen for prematurity <lb/>(AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.09). <lb/>Population attributable risk fractions <lb/>Figure 1 presents the hypothetical proportion of adverse <lb/>outcome that could be avoided if we assume that all <lb/>women in this population planned their pregnancies, or <lb/>no women smoked around the time of pregnancy, or <lb/>both. Over 20% of low birthweight, and 4% of prematurity <lb/>could have been avoided if no women smoked during <lb/>and/or just before pregnancy. For pregnancy planning, the <lb/>potential saving was a further 10% of both low birthweight <lb/>and prematurity. The combined savings if all women <lb/>planned and no women smoked, was almost 30% of <lb/>low birthweight and 14% of prematurity. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Main findings <lb/>Not surprisingly, those women who planned their preg-<lb/>nancy were less likely to smoke than those for whom the <lb/>pregnancy was a surprise. However, there was strong evi-<lb/>dence for an association between planning a pregnancy and <lb/>neonatal outcome which was independent of smoking sta-<lb/>tus. Surprise pregnancies had almost one quarter increased <lb/>risk of low birth weight and prematurity compared to preg-<lb/>nancies which were planned after allowing for differences <lb/>in smoking. Smoking just before pregnancy had a stron-<lb/>ger association with low birthweight, smokers having <lb/>over 90% increased risk of low birthweight compared <lb/>to non-smokers. For those who were smoking just before <lb/>pregnancy, giving up or reducing the amount smoked had <lb/>a clear beneficial effect on low birthweight, risks being <lb/>reduced by just over one third. These effects were inde-<lb/>pendent of planning status and other health behaviours <lb/>measured in this cohort. We estimated that, in theory, <lb/>30% of low birthweight, and 14% of premature births, <lb/>could have been avoided in this population if all women <lb/>planned their pregnancies and were non-smokers around <lb/>the time of pregnancy. <lb/>Strengths and limitations <lb/>This analysis used data from a large, nationally representa-<lb/>tive, UK cohort study. The size provided the study with <lb/>good statistical power and the data contained information <lb/>on potential confounding factors with a low proportion of <lb/>missing information. However, as the information was <lb/>collected nine months post birth there is likely to be <lb/>some information bias as respondents were asked to <lb/>recall events up to two years before they were interviewed. <lb/>Self-reported smoking habits, in particular, is vulnerable <lb/>to underreporting [12]. Although we are reassured to some <lb/>extent that the rates of pre-pregnancy smoking were similar <lb/>to national rates for 2000 reported elsewhere [13], we need <lb/>to assess the impact of underreporting of smoking during <lb/>pregnancy on our findings. If under reporting of smoking <lb/>during pregnancy was similar in those with and without a <lb/>low birthweight or preterm baby the effect would be to bias <lb/>the measure of effect towards a null effect. It is thus un-<lb/>likely to be an explanation for the smoking effects seen in <lb/>these data. However, since the outcome of pregnancy was <lb/>known at the time the questions on smoking were asked, <lb/>we have to consider the possibility that underreporting <lb/>of smoking status during pregnancy could be different <lb/>Table 2 Association between pregnancy planning status and neonatal outcome <lb/>Neonatal outcome <lb/>in mothers who <lb/>planned pregnancy <lb/>Neonatal outcome in <lb/>mothers who did not <lb/>plan pregnancy <lb/>Crude 1 <lb/>Adjusted model 1 * Adjusted model 2 ** <lb/>n/N (%) <lb/>n/N (%) <lb/>OR (95% CI) <lb/>OR <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>OR <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>Low birth weight (&lt;2.5 kg) <lb/>541/10,394 (5.21) <lb/>561/7,762(7.22) <lb/>1.42 (1.22-1.65) 1.27 <lb/>(1.06-1.51) <lb/>1.24 <lb/>(1.04-1.48) <lb/>Prematurity (&lt; 37 weeks gestation) <lb/>653/10,359 (6.30) <lb/>626/7,675 (8.16) <lb/>1.32 (1.15-1.52) 1.23 <lb/>(1.05-1.45) <lb/>1.24 <lb/>(1.05-1.45) <lb/>The baseline group was women who had planned their pregnancy. <lb/>*All adjusted for: mother&apos;s age, deprivation, relationship status, fertility treatment.

			<body>for those with, and without, a low birthweight/preterm <lb/>baby. For differential under-reporting of smoking habits to <lb/>explain the findings reported here, under-reporting would <lb/>have to be less likely (reporting being more accurate) for <lb/>mothers with low birthweight/preterm babies compared <lb/>to that for mothers with babies not low birthweight/ <lb/>preterm. We have no way of checking this with available <lb/>data, and differential under-reporting of smoking during <lb/>pregnancy may explain some of the effects reported here. <lb/>The MCS also only obtained information on babies that <lb/>had survived to roughly nine months. A subsequent inves-<lb/>tigation estimated that 180 babies did not survive to nine <lb/>months of age and so were not able to be surveyed [14]. <lb/>Four percent of records also had missing smoking data. <lb/>Since death and smoking are related to lowbirthweight <lb/>and prematurity, missing data of this type may have re-<lb/>sulted in an underestimation of the effect of smoking <lb/>on lowbirthweight and smoking in this analysis. <lb/>Part of this research compared smokers who changed <lb/>their behaviour and those who did not. There may have <lb/>been some women in the no change group who continued <lb/>to smoke a relatively little amount, and those in the group <lb/>that changed their smoking behaviour who still smoked a <lb/>comparatively large amount, for example if they cut down <lb/>from 40 cigarettes per day to 10. We did not examine <lb/>amounts smoked in this analysis. However, such misclassifi-<lb/>cation of exposure would tend to bias the measure of effect <lb/>towards the null, making our findings conservative rather <lb/>than inflated. <lb/>Interpretation <lb/>The characteristics of women in the MCS who planned, or <lb/>did not plan, their pregnancies, and who smoked, or not, <lb/>just before pregnancy has been reported before [15,16]. As <lb/>expected, we found similar socio-economic distributions <lb/>for these sub-groups within the MCS population. However, <lb/>what is unique in the current -analysis is examination of <lb/>the relationship between planning and smoking, and their <lb/>independent effects on neonatal outcome. <lb/>While it may seem intuitive that unplanned pregnancies <lb/>would be associated with poorer neonatal outcomes, the <lb/>literature on this question is not extensive and is some-<lb/>what conflicting. One of the main reasons for this is the <lb/>issue of adjustment for confounding factors including a <lb/>range of health-seeking behaviours that may be associated <lb/>with pregnancy planning but independently related to <lb/>birth outcomes, such as good antenatal care. <lb/>Studies of women who plan compared to those who <lb/>do not have investigated the effect on health related be-<lb/>haviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, folic acid <lb/>supplementation and antenatal care attendance. A study <lb/>of Turkish -pregnant women interviewed in an antenatal <lb/>setting found that 71% planned their pregnancy and they <lb/>were less likely to smoke, have lower alcohol consump-<lb/>tion, go to more antenatal sessions and take more supple-<lb/>mentation and nutrition compared to those who did not <lb/>plan [17]. The effect of planning a pregnancy appeared <lb/>beneficial in this study, but a Swedish study found only 20% <lb/>of women planning their pregnancy took folic acid during <lb/>Table 3 Association between smoking before pregnancy (yes/no) and neonatal outcome <lb/>Neonatal outcome in mothers <lb/>who did not smoke before <lb/>or during their pregnancy <lb/>Neonatal outcome in <lb/>mothers who smoked* <lb/>before pregnancy <lb/>Crude 1 <lb/>Adjusted 1 ** Adjusted 2*** <lb/>n/N (%) <lb/>n/N (%) <lb/>OR (95% CI) OR (95% CI) OR (95% CI) <lb/>Low birth weight (&lt;2.5 kg) <lb/>569/11,429 (5.00) <lb/>501/6,017 (8.33) <lb/>1.73 (1.42-2.05) 1.98 (1.62-2.41) 1.91 (1.56-2.34) <lb/>Prematurity (&lt; 37 weeks gestation) <lb/>748/11,352 (6.59) <lb/>485/5,966 (8.13) <lb/>1.25 (1.09-1.45) 1.14 (0.96-1.35) 1.12 (0.95-1.35) <lb/>The baseline group was women who did not smoke during pregnancy. <lb/>*Including women who reduced or quit smoking at some time during pregnancy. <lb/>**All adjusted for mother&apos;s age and mothers education.

			<body>the period in which they were planning [18]. A Canadian <lb/>study found a similar level of 28% of women who planned <lb/>took folic acid supplementation [19]. In both the latter two <lb/>studies, folic acid supplementation was more common <lb/>in those who planned, compared to those who did not <lb/>plan, their pregnancy, but the percentage falls far short <lb/>of optimum coverage of folic acid supplementation before <lb/>and during pregnancy. <lb/>Green-Raleigh et al found that women who were plan-<lb/>ning to get pregnant were more likely to decrease their <lb/>consumption, or abstain, from alcohol [20]. The study also <lb/>found that women planning to get pregnant were less <lb/>likely to be smokers, [20] as we found in the current study. <lb/>Another study which looked at the effect of planning in <lb/>adolescents, found that those who planned their pregnan-<lb/>cies had a higher rate of smoking, STDs, leaving school <lb/>and subsequent pregnancies compared to those who did <lb/>not plan [21]. It is thus unclear whether the positive effect <lb/>of planning on health behaviour transcends across differ-<lb/>ent age groups or if such decisions may affect subsequent <lb/>changes in health related behaviour. <lb/>There has been surprisingly little research into the effect <lb/>of pregnancy planning on morbidity in pregnancy but <lb/>unplanned pregnancy, severe pregnancy related nausea <lb/>and vomiting, high perceived stress and low social support <lb/>were found to be associated with lower levels of psycho-<lb/>social adjustment during pregnancy in a Taiwanese study <lb/>[22]. A study in Turkey also found women who did not <lb/>plan their pregnancies had higher rates of depressive <lb/>symptoms during their pregnancy [23]. <lb/>Research from as early as the 1970s showed that smoking <lb/>in pregnancy increases the risk of having a low birth weight <lb/>baby [24]. Our findings add to this evidence-base, demon-<lb/>strating a clear impact of smoking on low birthweight after <lb/>adjustment for confounding factors. Smoking during preg-<lb/>nancy has also been shown to increase the risk of having a <lb/>baby that is small for gestational age and suffering from <lb/>fetal growth restriction [25-27]. The impact on the fetus&apos; <lb/>growth may be partly explained by the increased incidence <lb/>of abnormal placental structure and function related to <lb/>smoking [28]. A review of intervention studies has also <lb/>shown that smoking cessation during pregnancy can reduce <lb/>the risk of low birth weight and pre-term birth [29]. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Evidence about the adverse effect of smoking before and <lb/>during pregnancy is strong, and effective smoking cessation <lb/>interventions have been identified. Our study provides <lb/>additional evidence of the benefits of stopping or reducing <lb/>smoking during pregnancy. The message that it is never <lb/>too late to give up smoking needs to be emphasised, espe-<lb/>cially at this critical time and for disadvantaged women <lb/>who are more likely to smoke during pregnancy. <lb/>With over 40% of pregnancies in this study being a <lb/>surprise, a more targeted policy to increase pregnancy <lb/>planning and awareness of pre-pregnancy health is recom-<lb/>mended. Compared to pregnancy planners, non-planners <lb/>tended to be young, single and less well educated women. <lb/>However, more rigorous measurement of pregnancy plan-<lb/>ning is needed to establish the full impact of pregnancy <lb/>planning on neonatal outcomes. <lb/></body>
