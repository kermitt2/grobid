        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a chronic <lb/>inflammatory skin disease characterized by the <lb/>recurrence of wheals and/or angioedema with <lb/>associated itch, burning, and pain that can sig-<lb/>nificantly impact quality of life [1-4]. <lb/>Type 2 inflammatory cytokines such as inter-<lb/>leukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, among others, may play <lb/>a role in CSU pathogenesis through direct and <lb/>indirect activation of mast cells, basophils, and <lb/>eosinophils, as well as immune-cell trafficking <lb/>into the skin and neuronal sensitization pro-<lb/>moting itch [5, 6]. Both IL-4 and IL-13 stimu-<lb/>late B-cell immunoglobulin isotype class switch-<lb/>ing to immunoglobulin E (IgE), which leads to <lb/>increased IgE production [7]. IgE is involved in <lb/>the activation and degranulation of mast cells, <lb/>which leads to the development of hives and <lb/>itch in CSU. In addition, IgE levels regulate <lb/>the expression of the high-affinity IgE recep-<lb/>tor FcεR1 on mast cells, which is also involved <lb/>in mast cell activation and degranulation [8]. <lb/>In a recent review of 141 studies, about 50% <lb/>of 926 patients with CSU had serum total IgE <lb/>levels above 100 IU/mL [8]. In a recent meta-<lb/>analysis including ten interventional studies and <lb/>866 patients with CSU, serum total IgE levels <lb/>were below 100 IU/mL in patients with a poor <lb/>response to omalizumab [9]. <lb/>Current therapies for CSU, including H1-anti-<lb/>histamines (H1-AH) and omalizumab (anti-IgE), <lb/>do not adequately control symptoms in all <lb/>patients, which leaves a significant unmet need <lb/>for alternative therapies [1, 10, 11]. Dupilumab <lb/>is a fully human VelocImmune ® -derived mono-<lb/>clonal antibody [12, 13] that blocks the shared <lb/>receptor component (IL-4Rα) for IL-4 and IL-13, <lb/>and thus inhibits signaling of these central driv-<lb/>ers of type 2 inflammation [14, 15]. LIBERTY-<lb/>CSU CUPID Study A (NCT04180488) was a <lb/>randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind <lb/>phase 3 trial comparing dupilumab with placebo <lb/>in omalizumab-naïve patients with CSU who <lb/>remained symptomatic despite H1-AH therapy. <lb/>Dupilumab demonstrated significant improve-<lb/>ments in the signs and symptoms of CSU, and <lb/>the overall safety was generally consistent with <lb/>the known dupilumab safety profile [16]. <lb/>Previous studies showed a potential link <lb/>between reduction of serum IgE levels and <lb/>improvement in signs and symptoms in patients <lb/>with type 2 inflammatory diseases treated with <lb/>dupilumab [17-20]. In this subgroup analysis of <lb/>LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A, we hypothesized <lb/>that dupilumab would similarly decrease serum <lb/>IgE levels in patients with CSU. As IL-4/IL-13 <lb/>in CSU may also be involved in direct mast cell <lb/>activation, immune-cell trafficking, and neu-<lb/>ronal sensitization [5, 21-25], we hypothesized <lb/>that the response to dupilumab would be inde-<lb/>pendent of baseline IgE levels. The current anal-<lb/>ysis evaluated the effect of dupilumab treatment <lb/>on CSU signs and symptoms and serum total IgE <lb/>levels in LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A patients <lb/>stratified by baseline serum total IgE levels. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study Design <lb/>LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A was a 24-week, <lb/>multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, <lb/>double-blind, phase 3 study conducted in <lb/>patients with CSU from nine countries. This <lb/>study was conducted in accordance with the <lb/>ethical standards of the responsible committees, <lb/>the Declaration of Helsinki, the International <lb/>Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical <lb/>Practice guidelines, and applicable regulatory <lb/>requirements. All patients or their parents/ <lb/>guardians provided written informed consent <lb/>before participating in the trial. Regarding pedi-<lb/>atric patients, consent was provided according <lb/>to the Ethics Committee [Institutional Review <lb/>Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee]-<lb/>approved standard practice for pediatric patients <lb/>at each participating center. <lb/>Patients and Treatments <lb/>Detailed eligibility criteria for LIBERTY-CSU <lb/>CUPID Study A have been described by Maurer <lb/>et al. [16]. Briefly, patients participating in LIB-<lb/>ERTY-CSU CUPID Study A were aged ≥ 6 years, <lb/>had had a diagnosis of CSU for more than 6 <lb/></body>

        <body>months prior to the screening visit, presence of <lb/>itch and hives for &gt; 6 consecutive weeks despite <lb/>H1-AH use, a Urticaria Activity Score over 7 <lb/>days (UAS7) ≥ 16 and Itch Severity Score over 7 <lb/>days (ISS7) ≥ 8, were omalizumab naïve, and had <lb/>received background therapy of up to fourfold <lb/>the licensed dose of H1-AH. <lb/>Study participants were randomized 1:1 to <lb/>receive either dupilumab or matched placebo. <lb/>Adults and adolescents ≥ 60 kg received a 600 <lb/>mg loading dose followed by 300 mg every 2 <lb/>weeks, adolescents &lt; 60 kg and children ≥ 30 kg <lb/>received a 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 <lb/>mg every 2 weeks, and children ≥ 15 kg and &lt; 30 <lb/>kg received a 600 mg loading dose followed by <lb/>300 mg every 4 weeks. <lb/>Endpoints <lb/>The primary data of LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study <lb/>A have been published previously [16]. In this <lb/>subgroup analysis, efficacy endpoints were <lb/>change in serum total IgE levels from baseline at <lb/>week 12 and week 24, and change in ISS7, UAS7, <lb/>and Hives Severity Score over 7 days (HSS7) from <lb/>baseline at week 12 and week 24 in patients with <lb/>serum total IgE above and below 100 IU/mL at <lb/>baseline. <lb/>Safety endpoints included the proportion of <lb/>patients with at least one treatment-emergent <lb/>adverse event (TEAE), the proportion of patients <lb/>with any serious TEAE, deaths, the proportion of <lb/>patients with TEAEs leading to study discontinu-<lb/>ation, and TEAEs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in <lb/>any treatment group. <lb/>Statistical Analyses <lb/>Unless otherwise stated, analyses were per-<lb/>formed in the intent-to-treat population, con-<lb/>sisting of all randomized participants. Analy-<lb/>ses were carried out by fitting an analysis of <lb/>covariance (ANCOVA) model for each imputed <lb/>complete item of data with the corresponding <lb/>baseline value, intervention group, presence of <lb/>angioedema at baseline, and regions as covari-<lb/>ates. The analyses were based on the same <lb/>imputed dataset using worst observation carried <lb/>forward/multiple imputation that was used in <lb/>the primary analysis of the primary endpoint <lb/>of LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A. The compari-<lb/>son for the subgroup-by-intervention interac-<lb/>tion was also calculated by fitting an ANCOVA <lb/>model with the corresponding baseline value, <lb/>intervention group, presence of angioedema at <lb/>baseline, and regions as covariates, plus the sub-<lb/>group variable and the subgroup-by-interven-<lb/>tion interaction. Analysis was based on the same <lb/>imputed dataset using worst-observation carried <lb/>forward/multiple imputation from the primary <lb/>analysis of the primary endpoint. Pearson corre-<lb/>lation coefficients were calculated for the change <lb/>from baseline in IgE and change from baseline <lb/>in ISS7, HSS7, and UAS7 at week 12 and week <lb/>24 separately within each treatment group. IgE <lb/>change from baseline and percent change from <lb/>baseline at week 12 and week 24 were summa-<lb/>rized descriptively. Correlation coefficients were <lb/>calculated for the overall population and for par-<lb/>ticipants with baseline serum total IgE &lt; 100 IU/ <lb/>mL or ≥ 100 IU/mL. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Patients <lb/>Baseline serum total IgE data were available for <lb/>65 placebo-treated and 66 dupilumab-treated <lb/>patients from LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A <lb/>(serum IgE levels at baseline were not available <lb/>for 3 placebo recipients and 4 dupilumab recipi-<lb/>ents). Patient demographics and baseline char-<lb/>acteristics have been described previously [16]. <lb/>Due to extreme outliers and skewed data, <lb/>medians were used in this analysis. In placebo-<lb/>treated patients, baseline median [interquartile <lb/>range (IQR)] IgE was 29.0 (14.3; 47.7) and 221.0 <lb/>(140.0; 693.0) IU/mL in the subgroups with <lb/></body>

        <body>weak correlation (r &lt; 0.2) was observed between <lb/>IgE reduction and ISS7, UAS7, and HSS7 out-<lb/>comes, suggesting that the efficacy of dupilumab <lb/>in CSU is only partially mediated by modula-<lb/>tion of IgE-dependent pathways. Safety find-<lb/>ings were generally consistent with the known <lb/>dupilumab safety profile [16]. On the basis of <lb/>these findings using the 100 IU/mL cutoff, base-<lb/>line total IgE appears to have no predictive value <lb/>as a dupilumab treatment response biomarker <lb/>in CSU. <lb/>The pathophysiology of CSU is thought to <lb/>include both type I autoimmunity (autoallergy; <lb/>IgE autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase, <lb/>thyroglobulin, tissue factor, double-stranded <lb/>DNA, IL-24) and type IIb autoimmunity [IgG <lb/>or immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies <lb/>against IgE and/or its high-affinity receptor, <lb/>FcεRI] [29-32]. Many studies have defined ele-<lb/>vated IgE as a serum total IgE &gt; 100 IU/mL [8]. <lb/>However, IgE levels are known to vary with age, <lb/>sex, genetic background, and environmental <lb/>exposure. Higher-than-normal total IgE levels <lb/>have been reported in up to 82% of patients <lb/>with CSU, with the highest levels of IgE found in <lb/>atopic patients with CSU, indicating that atopic <lb/>status may influence serum total IgE levels in <lb/>patients with CSU [8]. High total IgE in patients <lb/>with CSU is associated with high disease activity, <lb/>long disease duration, increased probability of <lb/>responding to omalizumab, rapid relapse after <lb/>omalizumab treatment termination, and low <lb/>chance of responding to cyclosporine [8, 9]. <lb/>In CSU, IL-4/IL-13 may promote B-cell pro-<lb/>liferation and isotype switching, leading to <lb/>increased IgE production and mast cell activa-<lb/>tion. However, IL-4/IL-13 may also be involved <lb/>in direct mast cell activation (via IL4Ra expres-<lb/>sion on mast cells), immune-cell trafficking into <lb/>the skin, and neuronal sensitization leading to <lb/>itch [5, 21-25]. Given that IL-4/IL-13 may make <lb/>multiple IgE-independent contributions to CSU <lb/>pathogenesis, it should not be surprising that <lb/>Fig. 1 Median percent change in serum total IgE at a week 12 and b week 24 in dupilumab-or placebo-treated patients with <lb/>baseline IgE levels &lt; 100 IU/mL or ≥ 100 IU/mL.

In the current analysis, <lb/>baseline serum total IgE has no predictive value <lb/>Table 4 Safety outcomes <lb/>IgE immunoglobulin E, IU international units, SAE serious adverse event, TEAE treatment-emergent adverse event <lb/>a Data on serum total IgE at baseline were not available for three patients in the placebo arm and four in the dupilumab arm <lb/>Baseline IgE &lt; 100 IU/mL <lb/>Baseline IgE ≥ 100 IU/mL <lb/>Overall <lb/>Placebo (n = 34) a Dupilumab <lb/>(n = 31) a <lb/>Placebo (n = 31) a Dupilumab <lb/>(n = 35) a <lb/>Placebo (N = 68) Dupilumab <lb/>(N = 70) <lb/>Participants with any <lb/>TEAE, n (%) <lb/>21 (61.8) <lb/>17 (54.8) <lb/>16 (51.6) <lb/>18 (51.4) <lb/>40 (58.8) <lb/>38 (54.3) <lb/>Participants with any <lb/>severe TEAE, n (%) <lb/>3 (8.8) <lb/>2 (6.5) <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>0 <lb/>4 (5.9) <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>Participants with any <lb/>treatment-emergent <lb/>SAE, n (%) <lb/>4 (11.8) <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>1 (2.9) <lb/>5 (7.4) <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>Participants with any <lb/>TEAE leading to death, <lb/>n (%) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>0 <lb/>1 (1.5) <lb/>0 <lb/>Participants with any <lb/>TEAE leading to per-<lb/>manent study treatment <lb/>discontinuation, n (%) <lb/>1 (2.9) <lb/>2 (6.5) <lb/>3 (9.7) <lb/>0 <lb/>4 (5.9) <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>Participants with TEAEs that occurred with a frequency ≥ 5% in any treatment group, n (%) <lb/>Chronic spontaneous <lb/>urticaria <lb/>3 (8.8) <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>3 (9.7) <lb/>1 (2.9) <lb/>6 (8.8) <lb/>3 (4.3) <lb/>Angioedema <lb/>3 (8.8) <lb/>1 (3.2) <lb/>2 (6.5) <lb/>0 <lb/>5 (7.4) <lb/>1 (1.4) <lb/>Injection-site reaction 1 (2.9) <lb/>3 (9.7) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>4 (5.7) <lb/>Injection-site erythema 3 (8.8) <lb/>2 (6.5) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>4 (5.9) <lb/>3 (4.3) <lb/>Headache <lb/>2 (5.9) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 (5.7) <lb/>3 (4.4) <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>Nasopharyngitis <lb/>3 (8.8) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 (2.9) <lb/>3 (4.4) <lb/>1 (1.4) <lb/>Abdominal pain upper 2 (5.9) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 (2.9) <lb/>0 <lb/>Back pain <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>3 (9.7) <lb/>0 <lb/>3 (4.4) <lb/>0 <lb/>Dermatitis contact <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>3 (9.7) <lb/>1 (2.9) <lb/>3 (4.4) <lb/>1 (1.4) <lb/></body>
