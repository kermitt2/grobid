E. Rowlands 1 , C. A. Ryan 1 , L. Ye 2 , L. Rehm 2 , D. Pinna 2 , A. D. Kent 2 &amp; T. A. Ohki 1 <lb/>We present a study of precessional magnetization switching in orthogonal spin-torque spin-valve <lb/>devices at low temperatures. The samples consist of a spin-polarizing layer that is magnetized out-<lb/>of-the film plane and an in-plane magnetized free and reference magnetic layer separated by non-<lb/>magnetic metallic layers. We find coherent oscillations in the switching probability, characterized by <lb/>high speed switching (~200 ps), error rates as low as 10 −5 and decoherence effects at longer timescales <lb/>(~1 ns). Our study, which is conducted over a wide range of parameter space (pulse amplitude and <lb/>duration) with deep statistics, demonstrates that the switching dynamics are likely dominated by the <lb/>action of the out-of-plane spin polarization, in contrast to in-plane spin-torque from the reference layer, <lb/>as has been the case in most previous studies. Our results demonstrate that precessional spin-torque <lb/>devices are well suited to a cryogenic environment, while at room temperature they have so far not <lb/>exhibited coherent or reliable switching. <lb/></front>

			<body>Spin-transfer devices that operate at low temperature are of interest for applications that require a cryogenic <lb/>memory, such as Josephson junction based logic circuits 1 . A requirement for this application is high-speed oper-<lb/>ation with relatively low energy dissipation. Conventional spin-transfer torque (STT) devices, such as those being <lb/>developed as commercial room temperature memories, typically rely on thermal fluctuations to instigate switch-<lb/>ing and thus may not be suitable for low temperature operation. A conventional STT device consists of two <lb/>thin magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer, with the memory states being the layer magnetizations <lb/>aligned either parallel or antiparallel. However, the initial spin-transfer torque in these states is small and only <lb/>increases once a fortuitous thermal field causes a deflection of the magnetization, leading to nanosecond incuba-<lb/>tion delays for switching and stochastic switching characteristics 2-4 . At low temperatures, the further reduction <lb/>in the magnitudes of thermal fluctuations can lead to increase delays without engineering any additional source <lb/>of initial torque. <lb/>An orthogonal spin-transfer (OST) device overcomes this limitation by having a spin-polarizing layer aligned <lb/>perpendicular to the free layer that provides a large spin-torque the moment a current is applied 5 . This perpen-<lb/>dicular polarizer induces precessional magnetization dynamics, as it forces the free layer magnetization out of <lb/>the film plane leading to coherent precessional motion of the magnetization about the film normal: the magnet&apos;s <lb/>hard magnetic axis 6 . Macrospin simulations show that, for a sufficiently strong out of plane spin polarization, the <lb/>magnetization should exhibit several full scale probability oscillations as a function of the applied current pulse <lb/>duration 7 . While experiments at room temperature 7-13 and cryogenic temperatures 14 have demonstrated fast <lb/>(0.1-1.0 ns) switching, these macrospin predictions have not been borne out. In those studies showing evidence <lb/>of probability oscillations, decoherence appears to suppress the switching probabilities beyond a single oscilla-<lb/>tion 7,14 . In one case multiple oscillations are observed, but switching probabilities never approach 100%, possibly <lb/>as a result of thermal decoherence and vortex formation in the free layer 15 . Furthermore, these experiments were <lb/>conducted over a relatively limited region of the phase space of applied pulse currents and durations. The rich <lb/>phase space predicted in simulations remains relatively unexplored. <lb/>Here we study switching in OST spin-valve based devices at T = 4 K with an experimental setup designed <lb/>to minimize thermal noise at the device and increase the overall measurement throughput. This enables us to <lb/>test a wide range of pulse amplitudes and durations and construct detailed phase diagrams of coherent mag-<lb/>netization dynamics. We demonstrate high speed switching for pulse lengths down to 100 ps and find error <lb/></body>

			<body>rates as low as 10 −5 that represent a large improvement over room temperature results. Additionally, we per-<lb/>form finite-temperature stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) simulations 16 as a basis for <lb/>comparison. <lb/>Results <lb/>The OST devices under study are 50 nm × 100 nm elliptical nanopillars with a CoFeB (3) magnetic free layer (FL), <lb/>an in-plane reference layer (RL), and an out-of-plane magnetized spin-polarizing layer (PL) as shown in Fig. 1(a). <lb/>Full stack details are given in the Methods section. <lb/>Switching studies are performed with a bias field set in the center of the minor hysteresis loop of Fig. 1(b). <lb/>These devices operate in a different regime than those from most previous studies, inasmuch as the out-of-plane <lb/>spin polarization exceeds the in-plane spin polarization. Consequently, the free layer&apos;s magnetization is induced <lb/>to oscillate out-of-plane by current pulses of either polarity irrespective of whether the system starts in the <lb/>antiparallel (AP) or parallel (P) configuration. The action of the in-plane polarization does not determine the <lb/>switching polarity; instead it only modifies the details of the magnetic dynamics. <lb/>Using the measurement procedure described in the methods section, we build up a phase diagram for preces-<lb/>sional switching over a range of pulse amplitudes and durations. These results are shown in Fig. 2(a,b), where each <lb/>pixel represents the switching probability averaged over ≈2048 switching attempts in each direction (4096 switch-<lb/>ing attempt for each duration/amplitude pair using the reset scheme described in the methods section). All data <lb/>is taken with positive currents. In both AP → P and P → AP switching polarities, the sample undergoes three full <lb/>probability oscillations with a period of approximately 400 ps. For longer pulses the switching probability does not <lb/>recover to 100%, and for longer pulses yet (not shown) the sample can occasionally become stuck in an intermedi-<lb/>ate resistance state. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that vortex formation is responsible for this behavior, but <lb/>that vortices can be disfavored by employing a synthetic antiferromagnet as the perpendicular polarizing layer 15 . <lb/>The difference between the critical current densities J c for AP → P and P → AP switching, apparent in Fig. 2(a,b), <lb/>is a result of the STT from the RL favoring the P state for positive currents and can be counteracted by an applied <lb/>field, as confirmed in the simulations detailed below. <lb/>To better understand these results we perform finite temperature simulations using the macrospin model <lb/>described in the methods section. We simulate the entire amplitude-duration phase diagram, shown in Fig. 2(c,d), <lb/>where each pixel gives the switching probability for an ensemble of 512 macrospins subject to different realiza-<lb/>tions of the thermal field. By varying the magnetic damping α, the spin-torque polarizations  RL/PL and asym-<lb/>metries Λ RL/PL of the RL and PL we are able to reproduce the shapes, periodicities, onset currents, and widths of <lb/>the probability oscillations. This allows us to identify the disparity between critical current densities J c for differ-<lb/>ent switching polarities, as well as the slightly increased AP → P switching speed, as stemming from the influence <lb/>of STT from the in-plane RL 17 . By adjusting the simulated offset field by 0.5-1.0 mT, this offset can be eliminated. <lb/>For negative pulses (not shown), we find reduced switching probabilities that are indicative of a non-zero Λ R <lb/>14 <lb/>. <lb/>The simulations of Fig. 2(c,d) are performed at T = 60 K in order to produce a broadening of the switching <lb/>bands similar to that seen in the experimental data. Estimates of Joule heating in similar structures 18 suggests a <lb/>maximum temperature increase of around 30 K, implying that some of the experimentally observed broadening <lb/>is micromagnetic in nature. Comparing constant pulse-amplitude slices of the simulated and experimental phase <lb/>diagrams, as shown in Fig. 3(a,b), reveals some further disagreement between model and experiment. At T = 4 K <lb/>the experimental probability oscillations exhibit a sinusoidal behavior before a precipitous decline in probability <lb/>likely resulting from vortex formation at the sample&apos;s edge 15 . Meanwhile, the simulated T = 4 K oscillations exhibit <lb/>wide high-probability bands with minimal rounding. At T = 60 K the simulations show a gradual decoherence <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>of the ensemble resulting from a dephasing along the out-of-plane switching trajectories 19 . Neither simulated <lb/>behavior is observed in our experimental data, so we infer that both micromagnetic and thermal effects induce <lb/>broadening and long-timescale decoherence at cryogenic temperatures. <lb/>We draw attention to the the synchronization of AP → P and P → AP transition probabilities in Fig. 3(a), <lb/>which are maximized for the same pulse durations unlike in previous experiments. This has important implica-<lb/>tions for memory write circuitry, which would suffer a substantial increase in complexity were it required to gen-<lb/>erate pulses of different amplitude or duration. The probabilities can easily be synchronized or desynchronized <lb/>by the application of in-plane magnetic fields. The low error rates of these devices at low temperatures compel <lb/>us to perform write error rate (WER) measurements that have not previously been warranted in precessionally <lb/>switched devices. Near the maximum of the second probability oscillation, as shown in Fig. 4(a), we find that <lb/>AP → P switching reaches 10 −5 error rates over a fairly broad window of pulse widths. For P → AP switching, <lb/>there is a comparatively narrow window where switching reaches a WER of 10 −3 . The error rates for the first <lb/>oscillation are similar but slightly higher. To our knowledge these errors rates constitute the best performance <lb/>of a precessionally switched magnetic memory to date. With our accelerated macrospin simulations we run 2 24 <lb/>simulations using the same parameters as before and can produce WER behavior shown in Fig. 4(b) assuming <lb/>a temperature T = 20 K that is consistent with expected Joule heating 18 . The imbalance of the WERs for the two <lb/>polarities is well-captured by simulations and stems from a combination of the external field and STT from <lb/>the RL (and STT asymmetry thereof). The most reliable operation points can easily be brought together with <lb/>the application of an external field, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The WERs depend strongly on temperature, and for <lb/>T = 60 K the WER increases to 10 −2 for AP → P switching. This is expected given that thermal fluctuations are <lb/>directly responsible for dephasing along the out-of-plane switching trajectories, and suggests that WERs at room <lb/>temperature will be limited. We emphasize, however, that macrospin simulations can over-estimate the impact of <lb/>thermal fluctuations on switching behavior since they treat the magnetization as a single rigid domain subject to <lb/>a single random thermal field. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We have measured high-resolution switching phase diagrams for orthogonal spin-torque devices that exhibit the <lb/>hallmarks of precessional reversal. For the first time in precessional devices we are able to achieve error rates as <lb/>low as 10 −5 . However, fine tuning is required before these devices will be practical for usage as a cryogenic main <lb/>memory. <lb/>The inferred spin polarizations P in these OST devices appear lower than in similar devices 8,14 . Accordingly <lb/>the magnetoresistance is suppressed and the critical current densities are elevated. An in depth analysis of how <lb/>these parameters depend on the deposition conditions is required. Subsequent reduction of the critical current <lb/>can be achieved by using free layer materials with lower damping 20 , by lowering the magnetization by doping 21 , <lb/>or by increasing the spin polarization of the magnetic layers 22 . After such modifications the WER should fall well <lb/>below 10 −6 given the corresponding reduction in Joule heating. <lb/>In terms of practical usage, higher magnetoresistance (~10%) is required before superconducting circuits can <lb/>be used to quickly read the device&apos;s magnetic state. Above this threshold, state determination can be made in less <lb/>than 100 ps using a simple two-junction comparator 23 . This low latency is important for read-before-write oper-<lb/>ations needed for non-deterministic operation (i.e. when the same pulse parameters can switch the device back <lb/>Figure 4. The error rates for AP → P (orange) and P → AP (blue) switching for J = 2.2 × 10 12 A/m 2 in the <lb/>vicinity of the second probability oscillation. (a) Experimental results at T = 4 K and (b) simulation results at <lb/>T = 20 K are shown. For (b) the dashed lines show the synchronization of the errors rates obtained with an <lb/>applied easy axis field H x = 1.3 mT while the solid lines correspond to no applied field. The shaded bands around <lb/>the solid traces show one standard deviation from the mean error rate as calculated by the beta distribution <lb/>constructed from the number of successful and failed switching attempts. <lb/></body>

			<body>and forth), as well as for error correction schemes that will bridge the gap between the observed WERs and the <lb/>&lt;10 −8 WERs required for practical use. <lb/>These devices can also be made to operate in a deterministic mode where the pulse characteristics (i.e. dura-<lb/>tion or amplitude) determine the final state. More complex write circuitry would be required in this case, but <lb/>latency would be reduced since read operations would no longer be needed to verify the initial state. Our sim-<lb/>ulations show that modulation of the easy-axis field and in-plane spin polarization can facilitate deterministic <lb/>operation: AP → P and P → AP transitions are driven selectively by pulses differing in duration by 200 ps. This <lb/>behavior is observed in previous experiments, albeit with high error rates 14 . <lb/>Using finite temperature macrospin simulations we reproduce many of the qualitative features of the rever-<lb/>sal dynamics and identify the distinct influences of STT from both the PL and RL. Macrospin simulations <lb/>cannot, however, reproduce the sinusoidal probability oscillations without introducing strong decoherence. <lb/>Micromagnetic simulations suggest that vortex formation may cause the abrupt decrease in switching proba-<lb/>bilities, and that such behavior can be mitigated by utilizing a synthetic antiferromagnetic polarizing layer 15 or <lb/>thinner magnetic free layers. Despite the computational intensity of finite temperature micromagnetics, such <lb/>simulations may be required to fully understand the origin of these features. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Devices. The full layer stack of our devices consists of oxidized Si wafer/CuN(60)/Ta(5)/Pd(2)/[Co(0.3)/ <lb/>Pd(0.7)] × 2/[Co(0.15)/Ni(0.6)] × 3/Co(0.15)/Cu(10)/CoFeB(3)/Cu(10)/CoFeB(12)/Cu(10)/Ru(7)/Ta(3). All <lb/>thicknesses (in parentheses) are given in nm. Nanopillars of various shapes and aspect ratios were fabricated <lb/>using e-beam lithography and ion-milling of the film stacks described above. The results of this manuscript come <lb/>from devices with a 50 nm × 100 nm elliptical cross-section, whose FLs have shape anisotropy that defines a mag-<lb/>netic easy axis in the film plane along the long axis of ellipse. Shape anisotropy also sets the magnetization direc-<lb/>tion of the thicker RL. The major and minor hysteresis loops of one such device are shown in Fig. 1(b), and exhibit <lb/>a clear offset of the minor loop resulting from an uncompensated dipole field from the RL. <lb/>Experiments. Sample chips are mounted and wirebonded in a custom package designed to support micro-<lb/>wave signals. The package is mounted on the cold-head of Gifford-McMahon cryocooler (Sumitomo RDK-101D) <lb/>with a base temperature of ≈4 K when loaded with coaxial lines. Switching pulses are provided by a pulse gen-<lb/>erator (Picosecond Pulse Labs 10,070 A), and reset pulses by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) (Keysight <lb/>M8190A), both of which are combined and then capacitively coupled to the device via a bias-T (Picosecond Pulse <lb/>Labs 5575 A) mounted at the cold head. The high speed line has cryogenic attenuators at both the 50 K and 4 K <lb/>stages to thermalize the center conductor and attenuate thermal noise from higher temperature stages. To provide <lb/>additional pulse amplitude resolution for the pulse generator (above the 1 dB resolution of the internal step atten-<lb/>uator) we use a voltage controlled variable attenuator (RFMD RFSA2113 evaluation board). The DC coupled port <lb/>of the bias-T is used to apply current bias and make resistance measurements using a lock-in amplifier (SRS 865) <lb/>operated at a 1 MHz baseband. The measurement line is low-pass filtered with a custom ECCOSORB low-pass <lb/>filter 24 at the 4 K stage again to suppress thermal noise from room temperature. The external magnetic field is <lb/>applied by a room-temperature electromagnet. A block diagram of the setup is shown in Fig. 5(a). <lb/>For each switching attempt we measure the sample&apos;s state before and after applying switching pulses. Because <lb/>switching occurs independent of polarity and initial state, we select a fixed-polarity reset pulse whose width and <lb/>amplitude cause the sample to reverse approximately half the time for either initial state. Reset pulses are applied <lb/>every other attempt, allowing us measure both AP → P and P → AP transitions in the same data run. For a typical <lb/>data run the initial state distribution using this procedure is 50.9 ± 0.05% P, 49.1 ± 0.05% AP. To maximize the <lb/>data acquisition rate, the experiment is sequenced by the AWG and is continuously streamed at rate of ≈10 kHz <lb/>until the desired switching statistics are achieved. A lockin amplifier is used to measure the voltage state of the <lb/>device with a 1 MHz reference tone, a 10 μs time constant, and a 100 μs settling time corresponding to an 18 dB <lb/>filter slope. The voltages from the lock-in were clustered into two groups using a k-means algorithm 25 and are <lb/>Figure 5. (a) Block diagram of the measurement apparatus. High-speed pulses from either the pulse generator <lb/>or AWG are capacitively coupled into the single-port device under test (DUT) via a bias-T. The low-speed arm <lb/>of the bias-T is used by the lock-in amplifier to measure the device state.

The shape and breadth of the distributions is commensurate with expectations for Johnson <lb/>noise of the reference resistor as measured with the lockin amplifier settings enumerated above.
