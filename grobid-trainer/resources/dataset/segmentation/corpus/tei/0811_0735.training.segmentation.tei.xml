			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Light water Cherenkov (WC) detectors have been used for many years as <lb/>inexpensive, effective detectors for neutrino interactions and nucleon decay <lb/>searches. Examples include IMB, Kamiokande, and Super-Kamiokande (SK). <lb/></body>

			<body>While many important measurements have been made with these detectors <lb/>(e.g. discovery of neutrino oscillations [1], discovery of neutrinos from stellar <lb/>collapse [2], limits on nucleon decay [3], determination of the solar neutrino <lb/>oscillation parameters [4]), a major drawback of such light water detectors has <lb/>been their inability to detect the absorption of thermal neutrons. <lb/>Neutrons liberated in water by the inverse beta reaction ν e + p → e + + n (and <lb/>other processes) are quickly thermalized. On average it takes about twenty <lb/>collisions with the water&apos;s free protons over the course of ∼ 10 µs to bring a <lb/>neutron emitted with a few MeV down to room temperature (0.025 eV). <lb/>Once thermalized, and after bouncing around for another 200 µs or so, the <lb/>neutron is captured by a proton or oxygen nucleus in the water. The cross <lb/>sections for these capture reactions are 0.33 barns and 0.19 millibarns, respec-<lb/>tively, so to first approximation every thermal neutron is captured on a free <lb/>proton via the reaction n + p → d + γ. <lb/>The resulting gamma has an energy of 2.2 MeV and makes very little de-<lb/>tectable light since the Compton-scattered electron is close to Cherenkov <lb/>threshold. Hence, in traditional light water Cherenkov detectors (which have <lb/>tended to have trigger thresholds around 5 MeV [5]) these neutron captures <lb/>are generally not recorded, and consequently there has been no way to tag <lb/>anti-neutrino interactions on free protons. For comparison, detection of neu-<lb/>trons from neutral current interactions has already been demonstrated in a <lb/>heavy water Cherenkov detector through mono-energetic 6.25 MeV gammas: <lb/>n + d → t + γ (6.25 MeV) [6]. <lb/>In this paper we explore two independent approaches to extracting this neu-<lb/>tron tagging information in SK, a 50,000 ton cylindrical water Cherenkov <lb/>detector viewd by 11,129 20-inch diameter photo-multipliers. These studies <lb/>collectively represent the first time that evidence of thermal neutron capture <lb/>has ever been observed in a light water Cherenkov detector. <lb/>The first approach [7] involved loading light water with a transparent, wa-<lb/>ter soluble compound of gadolinium, gadolinium chloride (GdCl 3 ). Neutron <lb/>capture on gadolinium yields a 7.9 MeV gamma cascade 80.5 % of the time <lb/>and a 8.5 MeV gamma cascade 19.3 % of the time (hereafter, both cascades <lb/>are referred to as 8 MeV gamma cascades). These relatively energetic gam-<lb/>mas should be easily seen in SK and readily reconstructed as events with <lb/>their own vertex position, time, and total energy, allowing event-by-event cor-<lb/>relation with previous positron-like events&apos; timing and position information. <lb/>Natural gadolinium has a neutron absorption cross section of ∼ 49,700 barns <lb/>as compared to 0.33 barns for free protons, so the amount of GdCl 3 needed <lb/>for this method to be effective is quite small. To get over 90 % of thermal <lb/>neutrons to capture on gadolinium instead of hydrogen, 0.2 % by mass of <lb/></body>

			<body>dissolved GdCl 3 (i.e., about 0.1 % Gd by mass) is sufficient. <lb/>The second approach [8] used 2.2 MeV gammas from n + p → d + γ reaction. <lb/>Instead of adding anything to the pure water in the detector, it involved the <lb/>introduction of special trigger electronics to force SK&apos;s existing data acqui-<lb/>sition (DAQ) system to take 500 µs of data with no threshold requirement <lb/>immediately after any primary events above a fixed, higher threshold were <lb/>detected. While most triggers falling within this special gate cannot generally <lb/>be reconstructed due to their very low energies, in this way some of the 2.2 <lb/>MeV gammas released by neutron captures on hydrogen in pure water can be <lb/>statistically identified as correlated in time with an energetic, primary event. <lb/>In this paper, we present test results of both methods. Tagged neutrons were <lb/>produced by using a bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillator cube with an <lb/>Am/Be radioactive source embedded inside; the resulting scintillation light <lb/>coupled with the emission of a neutron served to mimic inverse beta reactions <lb/>occurring within the SK tank. Section 2 is devoted to more details of the above <lb/>experimental setup. Section 3 introduces the newly-developed special trigger, <lb/>or forced trigger, used in both approaches of data-taking. Data analysis and <lb/>results with Gd are described in Section 4, while Section 5 is dedicated to those <lb/>employed with 2.2 MeV γ-rays. Finally, concluding remarks on this paper are <lb/>established in Section 6. <lb/>2 Experimental Setup <lb/>The apparatus used in both measurements was a 5 cm cube of BGO scin-<lb/>tillator with an Am/Be radioactive source incorporated in its center. Both <lb/>4.43 MeV γ-rays and neutrons are released from the source concurrently via: <lb/>α + 9 Be → 12 C * (4.43 MeVdeexcitationγ) + n using α&apos;s emitted from 241 Am. A <lb/>reaction to the ground state of 12 C also exists, which produces only a neutron. <lb/>The source intensity used in the experiments is 97 µCi of 241 Am, which leads <lb/>to 86.8 Hz of 4.43 MeV γ-rays and 76.4 Hz for the 12 C ground state reac-<lb/>tion. The scintillation light induced from these gammas were used to initiate <lb/>prompt signals, while accompanying neutrons were treated as delayed signals. <lb/>Usage of the BGO compensated for the disadvantage of low Cherenkov pho-<lb/>ton generation for the 4.43 MeV γ-rays in water. The scintillation light was <lb/>typically observed as ∼ 1,000 photo-electrons, or equivalently, 1,000 PMT hits <lb/>in SK. This high light output was capable of issuing the so-called &quot;high energy <lb/>trigger,&quot; one of the trigger types used in the normal data-taking (see Section <lb/>3). Moreover, the 300 ns decay time constant of BGO scintillation light was <lb/>long enough to discriminate it from Cherenkov events originating from either <lb/>8 MeV gamma cascades and 2.2 MeV gammas. An acrylic cylindrical vessel <lb/>was used to study the detection of 8 MeV gamma cascades liberated from Gd. <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>This vessel was filled with 2.4 liters of 0.2 % GdCl 3 -water solution together <lb/>with the Am/Be-embedded BGO scintillator installed in the middle of the <lb/>cylinder, as depicted in Figure 1. <lb/>Fig. 1. Configuration of the apparatus used for the study of 8 MeV gamma cascades <lb/>from Gd. The acrylic cylindrical vessel was filled with 2.4 liters of 0.2 % GdCl 3 -water <lb/>solution. The 5 cm cube of Am/Be-embedded BGO scintillator was installed in the <lb/>middle of this cylinder. This BGO crystal with the Am/Be source was also used in <lb/>the 2.2 MeV γ-ray search. <lb/>3 Forced Trigger Module <lb/>In SK&apos;s normal data taking, there are three types of trigger signals derived <lb/>from the total number of coincident PMT hits (HITSUM) in the inner detec-<lb/>tor. They are the &quot;Super Low Energy&quot; (SLE) trigger, the &quot;Low Energy&quot; (LE) <lb/>trigger, and the &quot;High Energy&quot; (HE) trigger. The HITSUM, as illustrated in <lb/>Figure 2, is the analog sum of all hit PMT signals within 200 ns. Once the <lb/>HITSUM is above the designed threshold, a global trigger is issued and PMT <lb/>data are digitized and stored in the internal buffers of the front-end electron-<lb/>ics. PMT data are then read out and stored in the two 1-MByte memories <lb/>of the Super Memory Partner (SMP), from which data will be transported <lb/>to the online system. Since the lowest energy trigger thresold at SK (SLE, <lb/>4.6 MeV) is higher than 2.2 MeV, neutron signals in pure water cannot be <lb/>observed. To measure neutron tagging efficiency, a standard nuclear instru-<lb/>ment module (NIM) compatible with current SK electronics was developed by <lb/>using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and a micro-controller <lb/>in order to provide selected triggers without threshold. This module can ac-<lb/>cept trigger signals from the SK DAQ system to issue a new trigger scheme <lb/>as already shown in Figure 2. The forced trigger parameters such as forced <lb/>trigger rate and the number of forced triggers can be programmed. During the <lb/>experiments, 500 × 1 µs continuous forced triggers were generated after each <lb/></body>

Due to the limitations of the front-end electronics buffering <lb/>capability and the two 1-MByte memories of the SMP, only about 128 triggers <lb/>per primary were collected. The front-end buffering limitation caused a 70 µs <lb/>gap between two bunches of forced trigger events. Since it is very likely that <lb/>other trigger events might have occupied the front-end electronic buffer, the <lb/>number of forced trigger events in the first bunch was usually less than 64. <lb/>Due to the limitation of two buffer memories of the SMP and the speed of the <lb/>reading process, all the triggers were vetoed after collecting about 128 forced <lb/>trigger events. These limitations will be eliminated after the upgrade of SK <lb/>electronics in September 2008, when 500 µs forced trigger data can be fully <lb/>taken. As mentioned in Section 2, the 4.43 MeV γ-induced scintillation event <lb/>rate was 86.8 Hz. To reduce dead time, we limited the primary trigger being <lb/>used to generate the forced triggers to 4 Hz. <lb/>4 Study with Neutron Capture on Gadolinium <lb/>In this study, the apparatus introduced in Figure 1 was deployed near the <lb/>center of the SK detector. Described in the following subsections are data <lb/>analysis and results with events collected by the forced trigger system. <lb/>4.1 Distribution of Time Difference Between Prompt and Delayed Triggers <lb/>The BGO scintillation light induced by the 4.43 MeV gammas produced the <lb/>prompt (primary) triggers as described in Section 3. Due to the limited DAQ <lb/>performance, available data existed within two 64 µs ranges measured from <lb/>the prompt trigger with the presence of a 70 µs gap in between. A parameter <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>∆T was characterized as a time difference between the prompt and delayed <lb/>(forced) triggers in terms of their time stamps. This parameter was studied at <lb/>the first stage of the data analysis to determine and extract the time ranges <lb/>that resulted in full efficient data acquisition. Figure 3 shows the result of <lb/>∆T range with 100 % efficiently activated data acquisition denoted by shaded <lb/>rectangles: 1.2 µs ∼ 48.2 µs and 134.8 µs ∼ 181.8 µs. For comparison, the <lb/>whole ∆T distribution is the area under the solid black lines. Events collected <lb/>in these time ranges were used for further stages of the data analysis. <lb/>0 <lb/>2000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>6000 <lb/>8000 <lb/>10000 <lb/>12000 <lb/>14000 <lb/>16000 <lb/>18000 <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>Data <lb/>∆T [µs] <lb/>Number of Issued Forced Triggers <lb/>Fig. 3.

Trapezia indi-<lb/>cate ∆T with all issued delayed (forced) triggers. Superimposed shaded rectangles, <lb/>on the other hand, are obtained with fully efficient activation of the data acquisition. <lb/>4.2 Vertex Distribution of Delayed Signals <lb/>Events consistent with delayed 8 MeV gamma cascades were expected to be <lb/>reconstructed around the Am/Be radioactive source. The histogram in Figure <lb/>4(a) depicts the distribution of ∆R = <lb/>√ <lb/>x 2 + y 2 + z 2 in cm for delayed signal <lb/>data, where ∆R was the distance measured from the center of the GdCl 3 <lb/>vessel (i.e., Am/Be source position) whose coordinates were identified with <lb/>(x src , y src , z src ) = (35.3 cm, -70.7 cm, 0.0 cm). In SK, the z-axis was defined <lb/>to run vertically, with its origin at the detector&apos;s center. Both x-and y-axes <lb/>were perpendicular to each other and to the z-axis. Therefore, the origin of <lb/>our coordinate system (0, 0, 0) corresponded to the physical center of the SK <lb/>detector. The majority of delayed signal events were observed in ∆R &lt; 200.0 <lb/>cm. A scatter plot of these is shown in Figure 4(b) with respect to z [cm] versus <lb/>x 2 + y 2 [cm 2 ], which clearly depicts the concentration of events the region ∆R <lb/>&lt; 200.0 cm. Detection of 8 MeV gamma cascades was therefore demonstrated <lb/></body>

			<body>through this vertex reconstruction in the vicinity of the Am/Be radioactive <lb/>source. Event selections at this stage included the ∆T ranges described in <lb/>the previous section, the choice of reconstructed Cherenkov ring events, the <lb/>energy region above 3 MeV, and the fiducial volume region which contained <lb/>the innermost 22.5 kton cylindrical water region. The Cherenkov ring selection <lb/>depends upon the pattern goodness of the fitted ring. This is evaluated via a <lb/>determination of the goodness of direction reconstruction using the uniformity <lb/>of hit PMTs about its presumed direction. <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>∆R &lt; 200.0 cm <lb/>(a) <lb/>Data <lb/>∆R [cm] <lb/>Number of Events <lb/>-2000 <lb/>-1500 <lb/>-1000 <lb/>-500 <lb/>0 <lb/>500 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1500 <lb/>2000 <lb/>0 <lb/>500 <lb/>1000 1500 2000 2500 <lb/>x 10 <lb/>3 <lb/>(b) <lb/>Data <lb/>x <lb/>2 <lb/>+y <lb/>2 [cm <lb/>2 <lb/>] . <lb/>z <lb/>[cm] <lb/>Fig. 4.

These two plots <lb/>illustrate the observation of 8 MeV gamma cascades with their vertices reconstructed <lb/>around the Am/Be radioactive source position. <lb/>4.3 Energy Spectrum and Thermal Neutron Capture Time for Delayed Events <lb/>Figure 5(a) shows the energy spectrum for 8 MeV gamma cascades with the <lb/>previously mentioned event selection criteria as well as the additional selection <lb/>of ∆R &lt; 200.0 cm applied. Data spectrum is displayed with bars. A Monte-<lb/>Carlo (MC) simulation was also conducted, generating 8 MeV gamma cascades <lb/>based upon GEANT4.7.1.p01 which in turn utilized the neutron database <lb/>of G4NDL3.10. The generated 8 MeV gamma cascades within the 2.4 liter <lb/>acrylic vessel were then incorporated into the standard SK MC simulation <lb/>using GEANT3.21. The hatched histogram in Figure 5(a) is its resulting spec-<lb/>trum normalized with the number of data events for comparison. The data <lb/>spectrum was obtained by subtracting the spectrum with a ∆T range of 134.8 <lb/>µs ∼ 181.8 µs from the data with a ∆T range of 1.2 µs ∼ 48.2 µs in order to <lb/>eliminate the contribution from non-8 MeV γ-ray-related events. <lb/></body>

These <lb/>fitted distributions with a sum of two exponentials both in (b) and (c) take into <lb/>account long-duration thermal neutrons scattered back into the Gd area after having <lb/>wandered in water. The capture time of the immediately captured thermal neutrons <lb/>were determined from the first fitted component to be τ = 20.7 ± 5.5 µs and τ = <lb/>21.2 ± 6.1 µs, respectively. These corresponded to an MC result of τ = 20.3 ± <lb/>4.1 µs. The first observation of 8 MeV gamma cascades from gadolinium in a large <lb/>water Cherenkov detector is thus demonstrated by these results. <lb/>The data and MC spectra were found to be consistent with each other, and <lb/>the mean energy value given by a Gaussian fit of the data was 4.3 ± 0.1 MeV. <lb/>That this number was lower than 8 MeV was expected, given the various com-<lb/>binations of multiple γ-rays possible in the cascades.

			<body>Compton scatter electrons above Cherenkov threshold; such gammas are in-<lb/>visible in SK. Figure 5(b) depicts the thermal neutron capture time of delayed <lb/>events in data. The remaining events in the ∆T range of 134.8 µs ∼ 181.8 µs <lb/>resulted from thermal neutrons being scattered back into the Gd regions after <lb/>having traveled out of the 2.4 liter cylinder. This phenomenon was studied <lb/>with the capture time spectrum of data independently taken without using <lb/>the forced trigger, as shown in Figure 5(c). Triggers of this data were issued <lb/>by the standard SK trigger system which required at least 17 PMT hits within <lb/>a 200 ns window as described in Section 3. The lowest level triggers, or &quot;super <lb/>low energy&quot; triggers were vetoed for 30 µs right after the higher level ones <lb/>(high energy triggers) were issued. Data in the range ∆T &lt; 30 µs were un-<lb/>available with this data-taking method. Distributions both in Figure 5(b) and <lb/>(c) were fitted with a sum of two exponentials, and the capture time of thermal <lb/>neutrons immediately captured on Gd were derived from the first fitted com-<lb/>ponent to be τ = 20.7 ± 5.5 µs and τ = 21.2 ± 6.1 µs, respectively. The result <lb/>from MC was determined to be τ = 20.3 ± 4.1 µs. These consistent results of <lb/>capture time constituted the first observation of 8 MeV gamma cascades from <lb/>neutron capture on gadolinium in a large water Cherenkov detector. <lb/>4.4 Estimation of Background Probability and Neutron Detection Efficiency <lb/>This section will discuss the probability of accidental coincident background <lb/>events as well as the neutron detection efficiency. Understanding the back-<lb/>ground probability will be indispensable for the eventual future detection of <lb/>relic supernova neutrinos, one of the principal physics interests in SK. The <lb/>present singles background level above 10 MeV in SK fiducial volume is 8 <lb/>events per day. The expected νe event rate from relic supernovas is 7 events <lb/>per year with neutron tagging. A reduction in background probability to ∼ <lb/>5 × 10 −4 times the current rate must therefore be achieved at this energy. <lb/>In order to investigate the possibility of achieving this reduction, randomly <lb/>triggered data in SK were taken. For this application, a 60 µs window was <lb/>adopted together with all the other event selection criteria already established <lb/>in the previous sections. A 60 µs window was sufficient to cover more than <lb/>90 % of neutron capture events based upon the measured capture time. Table <lb/>1 summarizes the results of background probability at three different energy <lb/>thresholds for delayed signals between 2.5 MeV and 3.5 MeV. The probability <lb/>at 3.0 MeV of 2 × 10 −4 times the current rate leads to the conclusion that <lb/>a 3.0 MeV threshold for delayed events will be satisfactory to accomplish νe <lb/>observations at 10 MeV. The neutron detection efficiency was evaluated in-<lb/>cluding the effect of 8 MeV gamma cascade events extracted above 3.0 MeV. <lb/>Figure 6 depicts an energy distribution for these events and 92.3 % efficiency <lb/>is maintained above this energy. Other components included were: 80.2 % re-<lb/>maining after event selection, and 90 % neutron capturing efficiency on Gd <lb/></body>

To detect these extremely low energy gammas, a special trigger <lb/>scheme, as already shown in Figure 2, was used to record possible neutron <lb/>capture events. The BGO apparatus was placed inside SK at three different <lb/>locations. Data taken under these conditions were referred to as source runs. <lb/>For comparison, data were also taken in the same locations, but without the <lb/>Am/Be source in the BGO apparatus. In such cases, the new trigger module <lb/>generated 4 Hz of 500 × 1 µs forced triggers without requiring any primary <lb/>trigger. Data taken under these conditions were referred to as background <lb/>(BG) runs. In either run mode, two 64 event bunches are intended for analysis <lb/>illustrated in Section 3. <lb/></body>

			<body>In offline data analysis, it was required that a qualified primary event should <lb/>have more than 1000 PMT hits and occur at least 1 ms after the previous <lb/>event. The timing selection ensured that no neutrons from previous events <lb/>would contaminate the sample. It was also required that forced trigger events <lb/>should not have more than 200 PMT hits in order to eliminate other coinci-<lb/>dent but non-neutron events. Neutrons produced via inverse beta decays have <lb/>a ∼ 50 cm free mean path and about a 200 µs lifetime in pure water. These <lb/>features could be exploited. Monte Carlo study showed that knowing the cap-<lb/>ture location could significantly reduce background. In this study, we used the <lb/>source position to subtract the time of flight for each timing measurement, <lb/>correcting the timing spread up to 150 ns. This correction could restore all <lb/>relevant hits to form a timing peak within 15 ns, which was significantly dif-<lb/>ferent from those from all the backgrounds. Selections on the number of PMT <lb/>hits in a given time window and the time window width were optimized in <lb/>order to give the best signal to noise ratio. <lb/>By comparing the PMT hit pattern of a signal with the known background, six <lb/>discriminating variables were obtained to be used in further background reduc-<lb/>tion. They were the average opening angle of the hits, the angular uniformity <lb/>of the hits, the number of hits within the 10 ns window (N 10 ), the fraction <lb/>of the hits in the forward hemisphere (N f orward /N 10 ), the mean distance of <lb/>the hits to their center of gravity, and the maximum distance among all the <lb/>combinations of the hits. Some level of correlation was observed between these <lb/>variables. A neural-net method implemented in ROOT [10] was then applied <lb/>to optimize the selection criteria. The signal sample for neural-net training <lb/>was from Monte Carlo simulation, while the background sample was from the <lb/>background run, in which the background data were divided into a training <lb/>sample and a test sample. Several neural-net architectures were tried and the <lb/>two-hidden-layer network with six input neurons was selected for giving the <lb/>best performance. The neural-net training procedure was conducted for each <lb/>source location. The neutron detection efficiency and the background proba-<lb/>bility are shown in Figure 7 as a function of the selection on the neural-net <lb/>output value. To select neutron signals from the source run data, all candi-<lb/>dates were required to have a neural-net output value greater than 0.99. The <lb/>∆T (Section 4.1) distribution is given in Figure 8 for the three different loca-<lb/>tions. All source runs showed the expected exponential curves for the neutron <lb/>capture lifetime in pure water. In contrast, the background runs only showed <lb/>flat distributions due to the environmental background (Figure 8). The levels <lb/>of contamination can be directly read from the vertical axes, since they were <lb/>all normalized to the same number of primary triggers. <lb/>To calculate the neutron detection efficiency, the source-related neutron back-<lb/>ground needed to be subtracted. At the event selection level, these neutrons <lb/>looked exactly the same as the normal neutrons that were accompanied with <lb/>BGO scintillation light. Since the timing is with respect to a wrong primary <lb/></body>

			<body>event, the distribution will be different from expected neutron lifetime distri-<lb/>bution. To simplify the study, all the neutrons from the Am/Be source were <lb/>classified into two categories: visible neutrons and invisible neutrons. The first <lb/>category was for those produced via the process with an excited state of 12 C * <lb/>emitting a 4.43 MeV gamma which became the detected particle. The second <lb/>category included neutrons whose associated 4.43 MeV gamma was not de-<lb/>tected as well as those which had no associated gamma. Signal neutrons fall <lb/>into the first category, but they only account for a small fraction since the pri-<lb/>mary trigger rate was prescaled down to 4 Hz. Most of visible neutrons in the <lb/>first category are background neutrons for this study and all neutrons of the <lb/>second category are background neutrons. Using the estimated detection effi-<lb/>ciency in the BGO scintillator apparatus and the estimated production rates <lb/>for both visible neutrons and invisible neutrons, the source-related neutron <lb/>background rate at a given forced trigger time t relative to the primary event <lb/>was calculated to be: <lb/>R n (t) = R inv <lb/>n + R vis <lb/>n <lb/>1 − exp <lb/>t <lb/>τ <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where the rates of R inv <lb/>n <lb/>and R vis <lb/>n were estimated to be 76.4 Hz and 86.8 Hz, <lb/>respectively. The τ was neutron capture lifetime in pure water. In the fit to <lb/>the timing distributions without the environmental background, the following <lb/>probability P (t) was used: <lb/>P (t) = α • exp − <lb/>t <lb/>τ <lb/>+ α • τ • R n (t) • 10 −6 , <lb/>(2) <lb/>where the 10 −6 was a factor to convert the neutron rate to µs units, and α <lb/>was a fit parameter related to the neutron detection efficiency: <lb/>ǫ = <lb/>α • τ <lb/>time bin width <lb/>. <lb/>(3) <lb/>where the time bin width is 5 µs in this analysis. The results of the fits are <lb/>listed in Table 2. All the neutron capture lifetime values were consistent with <lb/>the expected ∼ 200 µs. The measured neutron capture lifetime at SK using <lb/>this method was <lb/>τ = (207 ± 17 stat. )µs. <lb/>(4) <lb/>The neutron detection efficiencies at three different locations were derived us-<lb/>ing a fixed 200 µs lifetime as shown in Table 2.

A fixed 200 µs neutron capture lifetime is used to derive the neutron detection <lb/>efficiencies.

The measured neutron efficiencies are in <lb/>agreement with those expected from Monte Carlo simulation. The efficiency is <lb/>observed to increase when the capture location is close to the wall of the inner <lb/>tank, since the small amount of light produced by the 2.2 MeV gammas suffers <lb/>less attenuation effects. The position-independent background probability is <lb/>considered to be approximately 3 × 10 −2 . Backgrounds are originated from γ&apos;s <lb/>from the rock surrounding the detector, radioactive decay in the PMT glass, <lb/>and radon contamination in the water. <lb/>6 Summary <lb/>A first observation of neutrons has been established in a large light water <lb/>Cherenkov detector using two different techniques. One of the techniques was <lb/>the use of 2.4 liters of 0.2 % GdCl 3 -water solution which yielded 8 MeV γ-ray <lb/>cascades from neutron captures on gadolinium. A study using this technique <lb/>achieved 66.7 % neutron tagging efficiency with a 3 MeV energy threshold for <lb/>delayed events. Moreover, a background reduction level of 2 × 10 −4 at a 10 <lb/>MeV prompt event analysis threshold for νe &apos;s was realized. <lb/>The other technique, a 2.2 MeV γ-ray search for neutrons captured on free <lb/>protons, was also performed. This study revealed position-dependent detec-<lb/>tion efficiencies of neutrons ranging from 13.1 % to 24.5 % with the aid of a <lb/>forced trigger system. These values indicated an approximate neutron detec-<lb/>tion efficiency of 20 % assuming 2.2 MeV gammas are uniformly produced in <lb/></body>
