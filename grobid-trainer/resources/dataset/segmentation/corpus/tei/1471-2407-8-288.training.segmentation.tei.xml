Usually there is an unbalanced translocation breakpoint in 8p12 (29.7 <lb/>Mb – 38.5 Mb) with loss of distal 8p, sometimes with proximal amplification of 8p11-12. <lb/>Rearrangements in 8p11-12 have been investigated using high-resolution array CGH, but the first <lb/>30 Mb of 8p are less well characterised, although this region contains several proposed tumour <lb/>suppressor genes. <lb/> Methods: We analysed the whole of 8p by array CGH at tiling-path BAC resolution in 32 breast <lb/>and six pancreatic cancer cell lines. Regions of recurrent rearrangement distal to 8p12 were further <lb/>characterised, using regional fosmid arrays. FISH, and quantitative RT-PCR on over 60 breast <lb/>tumours validated the existence of similar events in primary material. <lb/> Results: We confirmed that 8p is usually lost up to at least 30 Mb, but a few lines showed focal <lb/>loss or copy number steps within this region. Three regions showed rearrangements common to <lb/>at least two cases: two regions of recurrent loss and one region of amplification. Loss within 8p23.3 <lb/> (0 Mb – 2.2 Mb) was found in six cell lines. Of the genes always affected, ARHGEF10 showed a point <lb/>mutation of the remaining normal copies in the DU4475 cell line. Deletions within 12.7 Mb – 19.1 <lb/>Mb in 8p22, in two cases, affected TUSC3. A novel amplicon was found within 8p21.3 (19.1 Mb – <lb/>23.4 Mb) in two lines and one of 98 tumours. <lb/> Conclusion: The pattern of rearrangements seen on 8p may be a consequence of the high density <lb/>of potential targets on this chromosome arm, and ARHGEF10 may be a new candidate tumour <lb/>suppressor gene. <lb/></front>

			<body>(comparative genomic hybridisation), array CGH and <lb/>LOH (loss of heterozygosity) analysis [1-4], their resolu-<lb/>tion, with the exception of studies on 8p12 which are dis-<lb/>cussed below, has been insufficient to provide a feasibly <lb/>small number of candidate genes for further analysis. <lb/>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies suggest that there <lb/>are at least three tumour suppressor genes on 8p, in bands <lb/>8p23, 8p22, and 8p21, lost in several epithelial tumour <lb/>types [6-8]. The highest resolution of these studies is just <lb/>over 1 Mb, showing that bladder tumours have a common <lb/>region of LOH between microsatellite markers D8S504 <lb/>(1.0 Mb) and D8S264 (2.1 Mb) in 8p23.3 [8]. In support <lb/>of this a lower resolution LOH study of ovarian adenocar-<lb/>cinomas identifies D8S264 (2.1 Mb) as showing the sec-<lb/>ond highest rate of LOH on 8p, with the highest rate at <lb/>D8S1827 (14.9 Mb) in 8p22 [7]. <lb/>Cytogenetic and array CGH studies suggest that distal 8p <lb/>is frequently lost through an unbalanced translocation <lb/>that breaks in 8p11-12 [3,9]. The 8.8 Mb between 29.7 Mb <lb/>and 38.5 Mb, encompassing 8p12, is the only region of 8p <lb/>that has been extensively studied at high resolution, using <lb/>tiling-path BAC array CGH [10,11]. The translocation <lb/>breakpoints are usually within, or proximal to, the chro-<lb/>mosome band 8p12 and several of them are within the <lb/> NRG1 (neuregulin 1) gene (32.2 Mb; midpoint on NCBI <lb/>Build 36) [12,13]. Most recent research has focussed on <lb/>this breakpoint region and more proximal changes and <lb/>array CGH has not been applied to the distal candidate <lb/>regions identified by the earlier LOH studies. <lb/>The other known recurrent feature of 8p rearrangements, <lb/>at least in breast cancer, is amplification of 8p11-12 in <lb/>10–25% of cases, correlating with poor prognosis [11,13-<lb/>15]. This amplicon was originally suggested to target the <lb/> FGFR1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1) gene [16], a <lb/>member of the same family as FGFR2 (Fibroblast Growth <lb/>Factor Receptor 2), a known oncogene and driver of ampli-<lb/>fication. However, it has subsequently been shown that <lb/> FGFR1 is not always included in the minimal region of <lb/>amplification and other candidate oncogenes have been <lb/>suggested [11,13-15,17,18]. Detailed analysis of 8p11-12 <lb/>amplification shows that there may be as many as four <lb/>sub-regions of amplification [11,17], raising the possibil-<lb/>ity that there are multiple cancer-relevant genes in 8p11-<lb/>12. <lb/>Array CGH studies at around 1 Mb resolution of breast <lb/>[19] and pancreatic cancer [20] confirm the general pat-<lb/>tern of loss of 8p but are of insufficient resolution to study <lb/>individual changes and identify candidate target genes. <lb/>Two tiling-path array CGH studies have been carried out <lb/>on seven [21] and ten [22] breast cancer cell lines. The first <lb/>mentions two changes on 8p [21]. MCF-7 has lost the <lb/>whole of 8p and T47D has two small deletions in 8p23.1, <lb/>although we now suggest that this is due to normal copy <lb/>number variation (see results). At least two further <lb/>changes – breaks at 8p12 with distal loss – are visible on <lb/>the ZR-75-30 and T47D karyograms included in the sup-<lb/>plementary data, but the raw data is not available for fur-<lb/>ther analysis. The second study identifies amplification of <lb/>8p11-12 in JIMT-1 [22]. <lb/>Overall the picture of events occurring on 8p, and espe-<lb/>cially distal 8p, is rather confused, due at least in part to <lb/>the lack of high-resolution data on 8p rearrangements and <lb/>the lack of array CGH data for the regions highlighted by <lb/>LOH as likely to contain tumour suppressor genes. Array <lb/>CGH suggests that a tumour suppressor gene is located at, <lb/>or just distal to, the 8p12 breakpoint cluster [10], while <lb/>LOH analysis suggests the existence of several more distal <lb/>tumour suppressor genes [6-8]. In spite of recent analyses <lb/>that might suggest a relatively small overlap in alterations <lb/>across different tumour types [23], the general pattern of <lb/>changes on 8p is similar across several tumour types and <lb/>is therefore potentially driven by the same selective pres-<lb/>sures. <lb/>Our objectives were to investigate whether there were <lb/>recurrent events on 8p outside the well-studied 8p11-12 <lb/>region; in particular to look for deletions in distal regions, <lb/>previously suggested by LOH to harbour a tumour sup-<lb/>pressor gene; and to try and make sense of the overall pat-<lb/>tern of changes seen on 8p. We set out to analyse the <lb/>whole of 8p by tiling-path-resolution array CGH in a <lb/>panel of breast cancer cell lines, and to investigate further <lb/>regions of recurrent rearrangement. We had previously <lb/>obtained SKY karyotypes for 27 of the 32 breast cancer cell <lb/>lines used in this study. Additionally we included six pan-<lb/>creatic cancer cell lines that show rearrangements of 8p at <lb/>cytogenetic <lb/>resolution <lb/>http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/ <lb/>~pawefish/index.html. <lb/> Methods <lb/> Cell lines and primary tumours <lb/> Details of cancer cell lines can be found in Additional file <lb/>1. Immortalised human breast luminal epithelial line <lb/>HB4a [24] was obtained from Professor Mike O&apos;Hare <lb/>(LICR/UCL Breast Cancer Laboratory, University College, <lb/>London, UK) and normal male lymphoblastoid line m62 <lb/>obtained from Dr Chris Tyler-Smith (Wellcome Trust <lb/>Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK). Both were cultured in <lb/>DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). <lb/>All tumours were invasive breast carcinomas of small size <lb/>(91% &lt; 3 cm) and low Nottingham Prognostic Index, col-<lb/>lected between 1990 and 1996 as part of the Nottingham/ <lb/>Tenovus series [25-29]. 65% were ER positive.

			ing RNA, TRIzol ® -extracted from fresh-frozen tissue, was <lb/>available for 61 of these tumours. <lb/> Array construction <lb/> For the 8p tiling path array, 328 overlapping BAC clones <lb/>for the length of 8p were selected from the 32 k clone set <lb/>available from the BACPAC Resource Centre (CHORI, CA, <lb/>USA) [30]. Additional clones to close gaps were obtained <lb/>from Invitrogen and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. <lb/>A subset of 6% of these BACs was sequenced to confirm <lb/>their identity. All except one matched their expected posi-<lb/>tion on the human genome. The remaining clone showed <lb/>evidence of containing more than one sequence and was <lb/>substituted on the final array. The selected overlapping <lb/>BAC clones for 8p provided an average clone spacing of <lb/>138 kb. A spot failure rate of around 10% resulted in an <lb/>actual resolution averaging 155 kb. For the fosmid array, <lb/>123 fosmids were obtained from the Sanger Institute, <lb/>mainly covering the regions of 8p21.3 (27 clones between <lb/>21.59 Mb and 22.25 Mb) and 8p22 (43 clones between <lb/>12.97 Mb and 15.68 Mb tiling three genes but not inter-<lb/>genic regions), identified by BAC array CGH as containing <lb/>multiple rearrangements, to a resolution of 0.04 Mb. <lb/>BACs were amplified by the method of Fiegler et al. [31] <lb/>and printed with the custom genomic 8p12 array first <lb/>described in Huang et al. [32] on CodeLink slides (Amer-<lb/>sham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). Fosmids were pre-<lb/>pared by the same method and printed as a separate array. <lb/> Array hybridisation <lb/> Array hybridisations were carried out essentially as <lb/>described in Garcia et al. [14] and Pole et al. [10]. Tumour <lb/>genomic DNA was labelled with Cy3-dCTP and a pool of <lb/>normal female genomic DNA with Cy5-dCTP (Amersham <lb/>Biosciences) using Bioprime labelling kits (Invitrogen). <lb/>Samples were hybridized to arrays overnight in the pres-<lb/>ence of Cot1 DNA (Invitrogen), and washed in PBS/ <lb/>0.05% Tween-20 at room temperature, 50% formamide/ <lb/>SSC at 42°C and then again in PBS/0.05% Tween-20. <lb/>Arrays were scanned on an Axon 4100A scanner with data <lb/>collected using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instru-<lb/>ments, CA, USA) and analyzed in Excel. For array paint-<lb/>ing, chromosomes (provided by Dr Karen Howarth, <lb/>University of Cambridge, UK) were sorted by flow-cytom-<lb/>etry and amplified by GenomiPhi (GE Healthcare, Buck-<lb/>inghamshire, UK) according to the method of Howarth et <lb/>al. [33]. They were hybridised against GenomiPhi-ampli-<lb/>fied normal female genomic DNA. <lb/>The array performance was tested by self-self and male-<lb/>female hybridisations and using known 8p rearrange-<lb/>ments in T47D (Additional file 2). Self-self hybridisation <lb/>gave a standard deviation (SD) of ± 0.08 and male-female <lb/>hybridisation ± 0.04 SD. Log 2 ratio shifts in response to <lb/>copy number changes were tested by hybridisation of <lb/>T47D against normal female gDNA. Copy number <lb/>changes were estimated by inspection, taking into account <lb/>both the shift in log 2 ratio and the level of noise for each <lb/>sample. In general a change in log 2 ratio of 0.5 or more <lb/>was scored as a change in copy number and a gain in log 2 <lb/> ratio of 2 or more was scored as amplification. <lb/> Chi-squared test <lb/> The probability of the observed distribution of rearrange-<lb/>ments on 8p occurring in the absence of any selection or <lb/>pre-disposition to breakage at certain sites was calculated <lb/>by chi-squared test. Chromosome 8 was divided into the <lb/>major bands (8p11, 12, 21, 22, 23) and the observed <lb/>number of rearrangements in each band tested against the <lb/>number expected at random according to the size of each <lb/>band. <lb/> Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) <lb/> Metaphase preparation and FISH was carried out as <lb/>described previously [10,34]. Chromosome 8 paint was <lb/>made using flow sorted chromosomes kindly provided by <lb/>Patricia O&apos;Brien and Professor Ferguson-Smith (Univer-<lb/>sity of Cambridge, UK). All BACs used for FISH were <lb/>tested individually on normal (m62) metaphases for <lb/>hybridisation to the correct region of chromosome 8. <lb/> FISH on paraffin embedded tumours <lb/> Tissue microarray slides were prepared from formalin-<lb/>fixed paraffin embedded tissue and analysed according to <lb/>the method of Chin et al. [35]. Probes for FISH on paraffin <lb/>embedded tumours were prepared in the same way as for <lb/>conventional FISH. A pool of three BACs, RP11-529P14 <lb/>(21.8 Mb; positions are given as BAC midpoints according <lb/>to NCBI Build 36), RP11-67H12 (21.9 Mb) and RP11-<lb/>70D12 (22.0 Mb), was used for the test region and a pool <lb/>of two BACs, RP11-381G11 (19.4 Mb) and RP11-222M11 <lb/>(19.5 Mb), was used as a reference. <lb/> RT-PCR <lb/> RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse <lb/>Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primer. Quantita-<lb/>tive real-time PCR was carried out, in triplicate, in 10 μl <lb/> reactions containing 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix <lb/>(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), 2.5 pmol both forward <lb/>and reverse gene specific primer and 1 μl of 10-fold <lb/>diluted cDNA. Cycling conditions were 50°C for 2 min, <lb/>95°C for 10 min then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for <lb/>1 min and a final dissociation step of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C <lb/>for 15 s and 95°C for 15 s in an ABI PRISM 7900 HT <lb/>Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). <lb/>Primer sequences are given in Additional file 3. Standard <lb/>curves for each primer pair were used to calculate amplifi-<lb/>cation efficiency coefficients and melting curve analysis <lb/>following qPCR confirmed that each primer amplified a <lb/>

			single product. Relative expression levels were calculated <lb/>as: <lb/>For primary samples expression levels were compared to <lb/>the median-expressing tumour. Purified luminal cells, <lb/>purified basal cells [36] (both kindly provided by Profes-<lb/>sor Mike O&apos;Hare, UCL, London), a range of commercial <lb/>normal RNAs (Stratagene (Cambridge, UK), USBiological <lb/>(Europa Bioproducts Ltd, Wicken, UK), Ambion <lb/>(Huntingdon, UK), BioChain (AMS Biotechnology, <lb/>Abingdon, UK), Clontech (Basingstoke, UK)), and nor-<lb/>mal breast line HB4a were used as normal controls. <lb/> Results <lb/> Array CGH results were obtained for a set of 32 breast and <lb/>six pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figure 1, Additional files <lb/>4). Five cell lines had lost the whole of 8p with respect to <lb/>8q, five had no copy number change on 8p, and the <lb/>remaining 28 had at least one unbalanced rearrangement <lb/>(Additional file 5). By chi-squared analysis the distribu-<lb/>tion of breakpoints across the different chromosome <lb/>bands was non-random (p = 0.0001), suggesting that rear-<lb/>rangements of 8p are under selective pressure or that <lb/>breaks occur non-randomly due to breakage-prone <lb/>regions. We identified, in addition to the expected trans-<lb/>location breakpoints and amplicon in 8p11-12 (29.7 Mb <lb/>– centromere), three further regions of recurrent rear-<lb/>rangement (Figure 1). These are located more distally on <lb/>8p: two overlapping amplicons, which defined a possible <lb/>novel region of amplification in 8p21.3 (19.1 Mb – 23.4 <lb/>Mb), a region of recurrent rearrangement in 8p22 (12.7 <lb/>Mb – 19.1 Mb) and a region of focal recurrent loss in <lb/>8p23.3 (0 Mb – 2.2 Mb). They identify a limited number <lb/>of candidate genes in these regions for further study. <lb/>Normal copy number polymorphisms were observed at <lb/>around 7 Mb in 8p23.1, where there is a high level of seg-<lb/>mental duplication and a family of homologous and <lb/>highly polymorphic genes, the defensins [37,38]. FISH <lb/>with BACs RP11-185K20 (7.80 Mb; positions are given as <lb/>BAC midpoints according to NCBI Build 36) and RP11-<lb/>43B8 (7.76 Mb) from this region on normal lymphoblas-<lb/>toid interphase nuclei confirmed copy number differences <lb/>were present between the homologous chromosomes <lb/>(Additional file 2). <lb/> 8p11-12 amplicon <lb/> As we described previously, most of the cell lines (25/28) <lb/>with rearrangements of 8p had at least one copy number <lb/>step in 8p11-12, with loss of most or all of 8p distal to this <lb/>region. Similarly, six out of the eight amplicons found <lb/>were in the known region of amplification in 8p11-12. A <lb/>full analysis of these events is given in Pole et al. [10]. <lb/> A novel amplicon in 8p21.3 <lb/> Two cell lines, MDA-MB-134 and BT-20, showed amplifi-<lb/>cation in an overlapping region of 8p21.3. This was con-<lb/>firmed and the amplicon further mapped by fosmid array <lb/>CGH (Figures 2a and 2b, Additional file 6). Both ampli-<lb/>cons contained the genes GFRA2 (GDNF Family Receptor <lb/>Alpha-2) (21.6 Mb), DOK2 (Docking protein 2) (21.8 Mb), <lb/> XPO7 (exportin 7) (21.9 Mb), NPM2 (nucleophosmin/nucle-<lb/> oplasmin family member 2) (21.9 Mb) and FGF17 (Fibrob-<lb/> last Growth Factor 17) (22.0 Mb). The centromeric edge of <lb/>the amplicon in MDA-MB-134 fell within gene EPB49 <lb/> (Erythrocyte membrane Protein Band 49) (22.0 Mb), <lb/>whereas the amplicon in BT-20 extended proximally to <lb/>encompass up to a further eighteen genes and one micro <lb/>RNA. By both fosmid and BAC array CGH, the amplicon <lb/>in BT-20 consisted of two levels of amplification with a <lb/>step up at 22.02 Mb (Figure 2a), placing the highest level <lb/>of BT-20 amplification outside the MDA-MB-134 ampli-<lb/>con. <lb/>FISH was used to confirm these amplifications and to <lb/>investigate their structure. FISH on BT-20 with BAC RP11-<lb/>235B11 (23.0 Mb), from the region of highest amplifica-<lb/>tion, and BAC RP11-459H21 (21.2 Mb), from the adja-<lb/>cent region of gain, suggested that these two regions of <lb/>copy number increase were not co-localised (Figure 2c). <lb/>There was one apparently normal chromosome 8 with sig-<lb/>nals from both BACs. All extra copies of the region of <lb/>highest amplification were found on a single small deriv-<lb/>ative chromosome. One copy of the region of lower <lb/>amplification was seen on this derivative and one extra <lb/>copy was present on a separate derivative chromosome 8. <lb/>MDA-MB-134 is known to have an 8p12 amplicon that is <lb/>part of a marker chromosome containing co-amplified 8 <lb/>and 11 sequences [17]. FISH on MDA-MB-134 was carried <lb/>out with BAC RP11-135I5 (21.5 Mb), from the 8p21.3 <lb/>amplicon, and BAC RP11-104D16 (40.2 Mb) from the <lb/>8p12 amplicon. This showed that the 8p21.3 amplicon <lb/>was intermingled with the 8p12 and 11q13 amplicons on <lb/>the der(?)t(8;11)ins(8;11) (Figure 2d). Incidentally, FISH <lb/>also showed that the two copies of this marker chromo-<lb/>some are not identical but have undergone further evolu-<lb/>tion since endoreduplicating. In addition there was one <lb/>apparently normal copy of chromosome 8. <lb/>Dramatic amplification of the region that was both gained <lb/>in BT-20 and amplified in MDA-MB-134 was found in a <lb/>single primary breast tumour, out of 98 useable tumour <lb/>cores, by FISH on a primary breast tumour tissue microar-<lb/>ray, with a pool of BACs positioned within the amplicon <lb/> Average Sample Ct for gene Average reference Ct for gene <lb/> − <lb/> ( ( <lb/>)  Amplification Coefficient for gene <lb/>Average Sample Ct for GAPDH Average reference Ct for GAPDH <lb/>Amplification Co <lb/> − <lb/> ( <lb/>) <lb/> e efficient for GAPDH <lb/>

			0.5-fold expression of EPB49, consistent with the edge of <lb/>the amplicon falling within this gene (Figure 2f). BT-20 <lb/>showed marginal, up to 3-fold, over-expression of XPO7 <lb/> and EPB49. Interestingly, one cell line, DU4475, showed <lb/>huge over-expression of NPM2 and FGF17 in the absence <lb/>of amplification (Figure 2f). <lb/>Since NPM2 and FGF17 were over-expressed in two cancer <lb/>cell lines, expression levels were analysed in 61 primary <lb/>tumours, from the primary breast tumour series analysed <lb/>by FISH, for which cDNA was available (Figures 2g and <lb/>2h). However, cDNA was unavailable for the tumour that <lb/>showed 8p21.3 amplification by FISH. For both genes, <lb/>cDNA made from five commercial normal breast RNAs <lb/>showed extreme variation – over 100-fold difference – in <lb/>expression across the samples, highlighting the problem <lb/>of identifying suitable normal controls for primary <lb/>tumour samples. The variation between commercial nor-<lb/>mal samples may reflect differences in how they are <lb/>obtained, for example if RNA is extracted from tissue <lb/>obtained after reduction mammoplasty it may be more <lb/>representative of adipocytes than breast epithelium. These <lb/>technical concerns may limit the utility of commercially <lb/>available normal RNA as a reference. Purified breast lumi-<lb/>nal and basal cells [36] were included as further controls <lb/>and tended to be more consistent in their expression lev-<lb/>els. <lb/>None of the tumours expressed FGF17 above the range of <lb/>the control groups (Figure 2g). Three tumours expressed <lb/> NPM2 at a higher level than any of the commercial con-<lb/>trols, although at a lower level than the normal luminal <lb/>and basal cells (Figure 2h). Although tumours do not <lb/>express either gene outside the range of normal controls, <lb/>there are four outliers/probable outliers for each gene, <lb/>which have expression at significantly higher levels than <lb/>the rest of the tumours (Figures 2g and 2h). Due to the <lb/>variability of the normal controls the most significant <lb/>observation may be that there were outliers over-express-<lb/>ing both genes within the tumour group. <lb/> 8p22 rearrangements <lb/> A cluster of copy number steps that might affect a com-<lb/>mon target gene were found between 12.9 Mb and 15.6 <lb/>Mb in 8p22 (Figure 3a, Additional file 5). Unbalanced <lb/>changes in this region were seen in four cell lines: <lb/>HCC1806, SUM44, DU4475, and pancreatic line MIA <lb/>PaCa-2, which has a homozygous deletion previously <lb/>reported by Bashyam et al. ([4]. In addition, we recently <lb/>found a reciprocal translocation breakpoint at 14.7 Mb in <lb/>HCC1187 by array painting, i.e. hybridisation of individ-<lb/>ual chromosomes to arrays [33] (Figure 3a). These rear-<lb/>rangements were fine-mapped to a resolution of 0.04 Mb, <lb/>by array CGH on a fosmid array covering the three genes <lb/>in this region, 13.0 Mb-13.4 Mb (DLC1), 14.0 Mb-14.5 <lb/>Mb (SGCZ – sarcoglycan zeta) and 15.4 Mb-15.7 Mb <lb/>(TUSC3) (Figure 3a, Additional file 6). <lb/>In SUM44 there were two copy number steps resulting in <lb/>an extra copy of a retained fragment of the region between <lb/>13.6 Mb, within the second intron of DLC1 by fosmid <lb/>array CGH, and 14.6 Mb, within SGCZ. DU4475 had a <lb/>deletion between 15.4 Mb and 15.6 Mb, virtually the <lb/>same region as the homozygous deletion in MIA PaCa-2. <lb/>The copy number shift observed in DU4475 was relatively <lb/>small and FISH, with BAC RP11-314P10 (15.6 Mb) <lb/>within the deletion and BAC RP11-480M18 (15.0 Mb) <lb/>just outside it, showed that the deletion was only present <lb/>on one out of the four copies of chromosome 8 present in <lb/>DU4475 cells (Figure 3b). <lb/>In HCC1806 two copy number steps fell in this region <lb/>(Figure 3a). Comparison of array painting results [33] and <lb/>BAC array CGH allowed us to assign these to two separate <lb/>copies of chromosome 8. There was a small deletion <lb/>between 12.6 Mb and 13.9 Mb, including all of candidate <lb/>cancer gene DLC1, on an otherwise normal copy of chro-<lb/>mosome 8, and a much larger interstitial deletion <lb/>between 14.2 Mb and 31.5 Mb on a del(8)(8p12-22). <lb/>Hybridisation of flow-sorted del(8)(8p12-22) to the fos-<lb/>mid array pinpointed the distal edge of the deletion to <lb/>between 14.19 Mb and 14.24 Mb, within the gene SGCZ <lb/> (Figure 3a). <lb/>Overall DLC1, the most well characterised tumour sup-<lb/>pressor candidate in 8p22, was only affected in a single <lb/>cell line by a copy number decrease that included two <lb/>other genes. This result is perhaps not surprising as it is <lb/>known that DLC1 expression does not correlate with copy <lb/>number [39] and, in several tumour types, down-regula-<lb/>tion is caused by promoter methylation [40]. In support <lb/>of this, DLC1 expression was decreased in 62% (8/13) cell <lb/>lines analysed by quantitative PCR, including four lines <lb/>without detectable genomic changes in this region (Figure <lb/>3c). <lb/>In contrast, TUSC3 was affected by two small deletions <lb/>that did not include any other gene. TUSC3 showed <lb/>decreased expression in these two lines with deletions but <lb/>not in any other line (Figure 3c). Anecdotally, TUSC3 also <lb/>showed decreased expression in a panel of 61 primary <lb/>breast tumours (Figure 3d). This identified six tumours <lb/>that had completely lost expression of TUSC3, and a fur-<lb/>ther thirteen that expressed it at a lower level than the <lb/>range observed in normal breast luminal and basal cells. <lb/>Neither the 5&apos; nor the 3&apos; end of SGCZ showed expression <lb/>in the lines with copy number changes within it <lb/>(HCC1187, SUM44), or model normal breast line HB4a <lb/>(results not shown), so it is neither a likely target of dele-<lb/>

			tion nor of activation or inactivation by the translocation <lb/>or insertion breakpoints. <lb/> Loss of 8p23.3 <lb/> Six cell lines showed losses close to the telomere, within <lb/>8p23, all including a minimum common region of dele-<lb/>tion from 1.7 Mb to 1.9 Mb (Figure 4a). PMC42, HCC38 <lb/>and HCC1569 had losses from the telomere to 2.2 Mb, <lb/>3.4 Mb and 3.7 Mb respectively; HCC1500 had a deletion <lb/>between 1.3 Mb and 36.5 Mb; DU4475 had a hetero-<lb/>zygous deletion between 1.1 Mb and 1.9 Mb and MIA <lb/>PaCa-2 had a homozygous deletion between 1.7 Mb and <lb/>1.9 Mb, first reported by Bashyam et al. ([4]. In order to <lb/>identify the genes affected by the minimum common <lb/>region of loss, the homozygous deletion in MIA PaCa-2 <lb/>was mapped by PCR. It included exon three, but not exon <lb/>2 of CLN8, and all of C8orf61, ARHGEF10 and micro RNA <lb/> hsa-mir-596 (Figure 4a). <lb/>Since DU4475 had a heterozygous deletion, in order to fit <lb/>the classical model of a tumour suppressor gene, we <lb/>would expect the remaining copy of the target gene to be <lb/>disrupted by some other mechanism, such as point muta-<lb/>tion, in this line. Expression data for multiple cancer cell <lb/>lines (not shown) suggested ARHGEF10 as a more likely <lb/>target gene than CLN8, since ARHGEF10 expression was <lb/>decreased by more than 50% in 83% (15/18) of lines <lb/>tested. We therefore sequenced ARHGEF10 in DU4475 <lb/>and found a C → T point mutation in exon 19 (Figure 4b). <lb/>This causes a non-conservative histidine to tyrosine sub-<lb/>stitution in the protein product at position 733, a highly <lb/>conserved region (Figure 4c). Although paired normal <lb/>DNA is not available for this cell line this nucleotide <lb/>change is not listed as a known SNP (single nucleotide <lb/>polymorphism) in the Entrez SNP database (Build 129). <lb/>The breast cancer cell line DU4475 was unique in having <lb/>five separate small deletions on 8p (Additional file 5), at <lb/>least three of which coincided with candidate tumour sup-<lb/>pressor genes: a deletion of the promoter of candidate <lb/>tumour suppressor TUSC3 (Tumour Suppressor Candidate <lb/>3) (15.6 Mb) in 8p22, an approximately 1 Mb deletion <lb/>between 21.9 Mb and 23.0 Mb in 8p21, containing candi-<lb/>date cancer genes RHOBTB2 (22.9 Mb) and DR5 (Death <lb/> receptor 5) (23.0 Mb) [41] but not extending as far as DR4, <lb/> and a deletion in 8p23.3, which emerged as a common <lb/>region of loss in this study. <lb/> Discussion <lb/> This high-resolution array CGH study of 8p in carcinomas <lb/>has allowed us to build a picture of the more distal events <lb/>on 8p and to put each change into context. Previous array <lb/>CGH studies have focused on 8p11-12 as a site of recur-<lb/>rent translocation and amplification [10,11,14,17,19]. <lb/>We now present a high-resolution dataset for the whole of <lb/>8p with specific follow-up of recurrent events occurring <lb/>on distal 8p – a relatively unstudied 30 Mb of DNA. <lb/>We identified three novel regions of interest on distal 8p: <lb/>8p21.3, which contained a novel amplicon centred at <lb/>21.8 Mb; 8p22, which had a variety of rearrangements <lb/>between 12.9 Mb and 15.6 Mb; and a region of consistent <lb/>loss centred at 1.8 Mb in 8p23.3. These results show that <lb/>high-resolution BAC array CGH is a good approach for <lb/>characterising genomic rearrangements to a resolution <lb/>that provides a manageable number of candidate genes <lb/>for further study in a cost-effective way. <lb/> Amplification around 21.8 Mb in 8p21.3 <lb/> A novel amplicon was found in 8p21.3 in both cell lines <lb/>and primary tumours. Amplification was a relatively rare <lb/>event, seen in 6% (2/41) of cell lines and 1/98 primary <lb/>tumours, perhaps due to the reported over-representation <lb/>of tumours with amplicons in the cell line collection [19]. <lb/>However, the presence of the amplicon in primary <lb/>tumour material confirms it as a genuine event in breast <lb/>cancer. Furthermore, the minimum region of amplifica-<lb/>tion contains candidate genes from families known to <lb/>play a role in carcinogenesis. <lb/> FGF17 (fibroblast growth factor 17) is a member of the <lb/>fibroblast growth factor family, a group strongly impli-<lb/>cated in carcinogenesis. FGF pathway genes, including <lb/> FGF3, FGF4 and FGF8, are common targets of MMTV inte-<lb/>gration [42,43] and FGFR3 mutations have been reported <lb/>in 41% of bladder cancers [44]. FGF17 is upregulated in <lb/>some prostate cancers and this correlates with a higher <lb/>risk of metastases and lower survival [45]. NPM2 (Nucle-<lb/>ophosmin/nucleoplasmin member 2) can catalyse the <lb/>assembly of DNA and histones into nucleosomes and is <lb/>involved in decondensation and remodelling of sperm <lb/>chromatin immediately after fertilisation. In the same <lb/>family, NPM1 has the ability to regulate the function of <lb/>the tumour suppressor protein ARF [46], and is mutated <lb/>in several haematological malignancies including 35% of <lb/>acute myeloid leukaemias [47,48]. GFRA2 mediates RET <lb/>signalling in response to the ligand GDNF [49]. RET is a <lb/>well-known oncogene that plays a role in the develop-<lb/>ment of thyroid carcinomas and the familial cancer syn-<lb/>drome multiple endocrine neoplasia (reviewed in [50]). <lb/>Of these genes FGF17 and NPM2 showed over-expression <lb/>in two cell lines, one with (MDA-MB-134), and one with-<lb/>out (DU4475), amplification. However, neither was over-<lb/>expressed in the second cell line with amplification in this <lb/>region (BT-20). If, as the array CGH data suggests, the <lb/>highest level of amplification in BT-20 lies outside the <lb/>region amplified in MDA-MB-134, there may be multiple <lb/>targets of amplification in this region. A similarly complex <lb/>pattern of non-overlapping amplicon peaks is seen in <lb/>

			8p12 and 11q13 in breast cancer, and has led to the sug-<lb/>gestion that they contain as many as four targets [11,51]. <lb/> Rearrangements between 12.9 Mb and 15.6 Mb in 8p22 <lb/> SGCZ (14.6 Mb), although disrupted by two unbalanced <lb/>changes and one balanced translocation breakpoint, is <lb/>unlikely to be a cancer gene. It forms part of the sarcogly-<lb/>can complex that links the intracellular cytoskeleton to <lb/>the extracellular matrix in muscle [52], and our findings <lb/>show that it is not expressed, either in normal breast or as <lb/>a consequence of rearrangement. Although DLC1 (13.2 <lb/>Mb) has a tumour suppressive effect in a variety of tumour <lb/>types, including breast cancer (e.g. [40]), it was not a <lb/>likely target of these 8p22 rearrangements as it lay just <lb/>outside the rearrangements in all except one case. This is <lb/>consistent with suggestions that genomic rearrangement <lb/>is not a mechanism of DLC1 inactivation [39]. If a tumour <lb/>suppressor gene is present in this region, then TUSC3 <lb/> (15.6 Mb), previously suggested as a potential target in <lb/>this region ([4,53,54], was the strongest candidate target <lb/>of the rearrangements of 8p22 in this study. Two cell lines <lb/>have deletions that solely affect TUSC3 and result in <lb/>decreased expression and expression was lost or decreased <lb/>in 31% of primary breast tumours. However, the presence <lb/>of several breakpoints in this region that do not appear to <lb/>have an effect at the gene level could alternatively suggest <lb/>that this site is prone to breakage. <lb/> Losses between 1.0 Mb and 2.1 Mb in 8p23.3 <lb/> Loss of 8p23.3, with a minimum common region of <lb/>between 1.7 Mb and 1.9 Mb, was found in both breast and <lb/>pancreatic cell lines, consistent with evidence from LOH <lb/>studies of a cancer gene situated between 1.0 Mb and 2.1 <lb/>Mb. 1 Mb array CGH data [55] from primary breast <lb/>tumours suggests that 8p23.3 is a genuine target in pri-<lb/>mary tumours. 8% (6/73) of tumours may have specific <lb/>loss distal to 10 Mb. However, analysis of that dataset is <lb/>difficult due to the low resolution and the effect of con-<lb/>taminating normal DNA on log 2 ratio shifts in primary <lb/>material. In combination, these results suggest the region <lb/>between 1.0 Mb and 2.1 Mb as the location of a tumour <lb/>suppressor gene. The genes affected by the minimum <lb/>common region of deletion, and therefore candidates, are <lb/> CLN8, C8orf61, has-mir-596 and ARHGEF10. ARHGEF10 <lb/> has emerged as a candidate colorectal cancer gene in the <lb/>sequencing screen carried out by Wood et al. [56], and, in <lb/>conjunction with our discovery of a heterozygous deletion <lb/>of ARHGEF10 in DU4475 with mutation of the remaining <lb/>copy, this makes it a strong candidate for the 8p23.3 <lb/>tumour suppressor. Functional data about ARHGEF10 <lb/>supports a role for it in carcinogenesis. It activates RhoB <lb/>[57], which is down-regulated in multiple tumour types <lb/>[58,59] and is necessary for apoptosis in response to DNA <lb/>damage in transformed cells [60]. <lb/> A parsimonious model to explain 8p rearrangements <lb/> A large number of cancers lose all, or nearly all of 8p, <lb/>potentially suggesting the presence of tumour suppressor <lb/>loci, while the occurrence of specific rearrangements on <lb/>distal 8p supports the theory that there are multiple cancer <lb/>genes located on 8p. Many previous LOH and copy <lb/>number studies, as well as our data, especially the specifi-<lb/>city of the deletions in DU4475, can narrow down the <lb/>regions of loss to 8p22 and 8p23; we suggest TUSC3 and <lb/> ARHGEF10 as possible targets of genomic rearrangement. <lb/>There may well be other tumour suppressor genes, such as <lb/> DLC1, located on 8p but these appear to be inactivated by <lb/>alternative mechanisms, including methylation. These <lb/>results lead us to suggest a parsimonious model to explain <lb/>the varied rearrangements seen on 8p in cancer (Figure 5) <lb/>The most frequent rearrangements are loss of distal 8p, <lb/>from 8p12 to the telomere, sometimes with proximal <lb/>amplification of 8p11-12. As previously suggested, unbal-<lb/>anced translocations through 8p11-12 can be explained <lb/>by the presence of a major tumour suppressor gene at the <lb/>most distal of these breaks, around 30 Mb [10]. However, <lb/>we argue that if this were the only tumour suppressor gene <lb/>on 8p, we might expect to see a mirror-image pattern of <lb/>breaks distal to this gene with the telomeric sequences <lb/>being retained, as well as interstitial deletions of the <lb/>tumour suppressor gene. A tendency towards loss of the <lb/>whole of distal 8p suggests that there is at least one further <lb/>tumour suppressor gene, and that it is located close to the <lb/>telomere (Figure 5). This is consistent with our data sug-<lb/>gesting a tumour suppressor gene is located in 8p23.3. <lb/>There can therefore also be any number of additional <lb/>tumour suppressor genes in between these two which <lb/>would give the same pattern of rearrangement, and our <lb/>data suggests that there may be at least one further candi-<lb/>date gene located in 8p22. In line with the application of <lb/>Occam&apos;s razor loss of both/all of these tumour suppressor <lb/>genes is most often seen as loss of the whole of distal 8p, <lb/>but can also be achieved by several more specific events, <lb/>therefore explaining the complex and inconsistent pattern <lb/>of changes on distal 8p (Figure 5) – tumours may have <lb/>deletions of varying sizes encompassing two or more <lb/>tumour suppressor genes as well as losing them all by loss <lb/>of the whole of 8p or a proximal translocation. <lb/>Cell lines with multiple small deletions are invaluable in <lb/>allowing us to narrow down the number and position of <lb/>tumour suppressor genes on 8p. The unique pattern of <lb/>deletions in DU4475, three of which target candidate <lb/>tumour suppressor genes or regions previously reported as <lb/>frequently deleted, supports 8p23.3, 8p22 and 8p21 as <lb/>candidate regions. Potential targets in 8p23.3 and 8p22 <lb/>have been discussed above while 8p21, although only <lb/>affected by a single small deletion in this study, is the loca-<lb/>tion of RHOBTB2, a candidate breast cancer gene based <lb/>

			on the discovery of two somatic mutations [41], and the <lb/>TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5, which have been suggested <lb/>as candidate cancer genes owing to their pro-apoptotic <lb/>function [61]. MIA PaCa-2 has two deletions on 8p, also <lb/>supporting the existence of tumour suppressor genes at <lb/>8p22 and 8p23.3. <lb/>Although the premise of our Discussion is that the driving <lb/>force behind 8p rearrangements is selection for the altera-<lb/>tion of cancer genes, the same pattern of rearrangements <lb/>might be observed if the driving force was the mechanism <lb/>of breakage e.g the presence of fragile sites on 8p. For <lb/>example, the breaks at 8p12 with proximal amplification <lb/>could be due to the presence of a fragile site that initiates <lb/>breakage-fusion-bridge cycles [62] although no fragile site <lb/>has been shown to exist on 8p [63] and 8p12 breaks fre-<lb/>quently occur without accompanying amplification. <lb/> Conclusion <lb/> While early work on 8p, driven by LOH analysis [6,7] <lb/>focused on distal 8p, more recent studies have concen-<lb/>trated on 8p11-12 [10,11] in an attempt to explain the <lb/>role of this chromosome arm in cancer. This present study <lb/>suggests that, in addition to the frequently observed loss <lb/>from 8p12 to the telomere with proximal amplification, <lb/>there are additional rarer events that occur on distal 8p. <lb/>While loss of specific distal loci may occur in only a few <lb/>cases, loss of these distal sequences may also add to selec-<lb/>tion for general distal loss following the commonly <lb/>observed breakage at 8p12 in many tumours. <lb/> Competing interests <lb/> The authors declare that they have no competing interests. <lb/> A parsimonious model of 8p rearrangements <lb/> Figure 5 <lb/>A parsimonious model of 8p rearrangements. The different patterns of 8p rearrangement that would be expected in a <lb/>sample of tumours based on the number and position of tumour suppressor genes (not to scale). Top is the pattern of rear-<lb/>rangements expected if there is a single tumour suppressor gene located in 8p12. Middle is the pattern of rearrangements pre-<lb/>dicted if there were at least two tumour suppressor genes located on 8p, one in 8p12 and one located close to the telomere in <lb/>8p23.3. This fits the common overall pattern of breaks in 8p12 with loss of distal 8p. Bottom is a representation of some of the <lb/>atypical 8p rearrangements found in cancer cell lines including DU4475, HCC1500 and PMC42. These can be explained by the <lb/>presence of other tumour suppressor genes in between those in 8p12 and 8p23.3; our results suggest at least one, at 8p22. <lb/>Since each of these tumour suppressor genes is only lost in a proportion of cases a complex pattern of rearrangements encom-<lb/>passing some or all of these regions results. Loss of the whole of distal 8p will be the most common rearrangement as it <lb/>removes all tumour suppressor genes as the result of a single event. <lb/> TSG <lb/> TSG <lb/>TSG <lb/>TSG <lb/>TSG? <lb/>TSG? <lb/>TSG <lb/>8p telomere <lb/>centromere <lb/>8p12 <lb/>8p23 <lb/>8p23 <lb/>8p12 <lb/>8p12 <lb/>8p22 <lb/>
