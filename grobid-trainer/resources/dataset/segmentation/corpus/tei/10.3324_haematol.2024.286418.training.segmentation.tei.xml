D-2-HG suppresses antitumor T-cell immunity but little is known about poten-<lb/>tial effects on non-malignant myeloid cells. Here we show that D-2-HG impairs human but not murine dendritic cell dif-<lb/>ferentiation, resulting in a tolerogenic phenotype with low major histocompatibility class II expression. In line with this, <lb/>IDH-mutated AML blasts exhibited lower expression of HLA-DP and were less susceptible to lysis by HLA-DP-specific T <lb/>cells. Interestingly, besides its expected impact on DNA demethylation, D-2-HG reprogrammed metabolism towards increased <lb/>lactate production in dendritic cells and AML. Vitamin C accelerated DNA demethylation, but only the combination of vita-<lb/>min C and glycolytic inhibition lowered lactate levels and supported major histocompatibility complex class II expression. <lb/>Our results indicate an unexpected link between the immunosuppressive metabolites 2-HG and lactic acid and suggest a <lb/>potentially novel therapeutic strategy with combinations of anti-glycolytic drugs and epigenetic modulators (hypomethyl-<lb/>ating agents) or other therapeutics for the treatment of AML. <lb/></front>

        <body>Introduction <lb/>Heterozygous somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydroge-<lb/>nase (IDH) were originally identified in patients with glioma <lb/>and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but they are also de-<lb/>tected in patients with other tumor entities. 1 Mutated IDH1 <lb/>and IDH2 gain neomorphic function to convert α-ketoglu-<lb/>tarate (α-KG) to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate <lb/>(D-2-HG), which accumulates in tumor tissues as well as in <lb/>sera of patients. 2 In tumor tissues of glioma patients 2-HG <lb/>levels range from 5-35 mM, 3 whereas levels in sera of AML <lb/>patients range from 2-300 μM. 4 Despite the absence of IDH <lb/>mutations, elevated 2-HG levels have also been described <lb/>in other tumor entities. In breast cancer, MYC overexpres-<lb/>sion triggers glutamine uptake and glutaminolysis resulting <lb/>in 2-HG accumulation, 5 whereas in renal cell carcinoma, 6 <lb/>the L-enantiomer of 2-HG accumulates due to reduced <lb/>expression of its degrading enzyme L-2-HG dehydrogenase. <lb/>Moreover, other enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and <lb/>lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can catalyze the conversion <lb/></body>

        <body>of α-KG to 2-HG under hypoxic and/or acidic conditions, a <lb/>process termed &quot;enzyme promiscuity&quot;. 7 <lb/>In some cancer entities, D-2-HG accumulation is associated <lb/>with worse prognosis, whereas an IDH mutation is a favor-<lb/>able prognostic marker in glioma. 1,2,5 The current view is that <lb/>the structural similarity between D-2-HG and α-KG causes <lb/>competition and inhibition of α-KG-dependent enzymes, <lb/>such as Jumonji-C domain histone demethylases. D-2-HG <lb/>also inhibits the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of <lb/>5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, a family of enzymes involved <lb/>in the first step of active DNA demethylation. 8 IDH1 or IDH2 <lb/>mutated AML display global DNA hypermethylation and ex-<lb/>pression of mutated IDH2 in mouse myeloid progenitor cells <lb/>in vitro increases DNA methylation while inhibiting their dif-<lb/>ferentiation. 9 Despite its effects on epigenetic programming, <lb/>expression of mutated IDH1 alone does not cause murine <lb/>leukemic transformation but promotes leukemogenesis only <lb/>in cooperation with an additional driver, such as HoxA9. 10 In <lb/>contrast, it has been shown by others that D-2-HG, but not <lb/>its L-enantiomer, is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis <lb/>in a human and murine cell-based model. 11 Collectively, <lb/>these data suggest that IDH mutations and D-2-HG accu-<lb/>mulation dysregulate the epigenetic machinery, which in <lb/>turn disturbs differentiation. Besides myeloid cells, en-<lb/>dogenously produced 2-HG also affects DNA methylation <lb/>and differentiation of murine lymphoid cells. 12 In primary <lb/>human T cells, however, Bunse et al. demonstrated that <lb/>gene expression but not the methylation pattern changed <lb/>after D-2-HG treatment, 13 indicating differences in D-2-HG <lb/>susceptibility between murine and human immune cells. <lb/>The same group recently demonstrated IDH-dependent <lb/>immunosuppression related to D-2-HG-induced metabolic <lb/>changes in tryptophan degradation by tumor-associated <lb/>macrophages. 14 <lb/>Here, we investigated the differentiation of another import-<lb/>ant population of myeloid cells, namely dendritic cells (DC). <lb/>In contrast to published data on murine DC differentiation, 15 <lb/>we describe the inhibition of human DC differentiation <lb/>by D-2-HG via induction of MYC, accelerated glycolysis <lb/>and reprogramming of the epigenetic machinery. Our data <lb/>suggest that D-2-HG might influence cell differentiation <lb/>by both induction of epigenetic changes and modulation <lb/>of cellular metabolism. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Primary cells and ethics statement <lb/>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from leu-<lb/>kapheresis products or leukocyte reduction system cones of <lb/>healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/ <lb/>Hypaque. Primary AML blasts were isolated by density gradi-<lb/>ent centrifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque from peripheral blood <lb/>of leukemia patients at initial diagnosis of AML, before they <lb/>had started leukemia therapy. Human CD34 + hematopoietic <lb/>stem and progenitor cells were isolated from stem cell leu-<lb/>kapheresis products of healthy donors after the donors had <lb/>been stimulated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. <lb/>The studies were conducted in accordance with the Dec-<lb/>laration of Helsinki. All donors gave their informed consent <lb/>to participation in the study and the protocols were ap-<lb/>proved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital <lb/>Regensburg (permission numbers 05-097, 17-587-101, 13-<lb/>101-0240, 13-101-0238, and 10-101-0099). <lb/>Monocyte isolation and macrophage generation <lb/>Mononuclear cells from healthy donors were separated by <lb/>leukapheresis, followed by density gradient centrifugation <lb/>over Ficoll/Hypaque. Monocytes were isolated from mono-<lb/>nuclear cells by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation in <lb/>a J6M-E Beckmann centrifuge with a large chamber and <lb/>a JE-5 rotor at 2,500 rpm and a flow rate of 110 mL/min <lb/>in Hanks&apos; balanced salt solution with 2% human plasma. <lb/>Elutriated monocytes were &gt;80% pure as determined by <lb/>morphology and CD14 expression. For the generation of <lb/>monocyte-derived human macrophages, purified mono-<lb/>cytes were cultured on teflon foils (Biofolie 25, Heraeus <lb/>Hanau, Germany) for 7 days at a cell density of 1x10 6 cells/ <lb/>mL in RPM1 1640 supplemented with 2% pooled human <lb/>AB group serum. <lb/>Dendritic cell generation <lb/>Bone marrow-derived murine DC were generated as de-<lb/>scribed previously 16 in the presence or absence of 20 mM <lb/>D-2-HG. <lb/>For the generation of human DC, monocytes were seeded <lb/>in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, gluta-<lb/>mine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), <lb/>interleukin 4 (150 U/mL), and granulocyte-macrophage <lb/>colony-stimulating factor (230 U/mL) at a concentration of <lb/>1x10 6 /well in a 24-well plate in 1 mL of medium or 7x10 6 in <lb/>a T25 culture flask in 10 mL medium. D-2-HG was added <lb/>once, immediately after seeding the cells, for the whole <lb/>period of culture. Cells were cultured for 7 days to generate <lb/>immature DC. Where indicated, the culture medium was <lb/>supplemented with D-2-HG (10 mM, 20 mM), the LDHA in-<lb/>hibitor GNE140 (1 μM, starting on day 2) or pyrazole-based <lb/>LDHA/B inhibitor NCI-737 17 (0.1 μM, starting on day 2) and <lb/>vitamin C (2 mM), respectively. Maturation of DC was induced <lb/>by the addition of 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide on day 7. <lb/>DC expressing mutated IDH were generated by in-vitro <lb/>transcribed RNA electroporation as described elsewhere. 18 <lb/>In brief, the coding DNA region of wild-type IDH2 including <lb/>a HIS tail was synthesized by GeneArt and inserted into the <lb/>pGEM4Z-64A vector for in vitro mRNA transcription. With <lb/>a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, site-directed <lb/>mutagenesis was performed to change the nucleotide re-<lb/>sponsible for the exchange of arginine to glutamine in the <lb/>amino acid sequence of IDH2 (IDH2 R140Q). Both constructs <lb/>were used to electroporate DC for T-cell stimulation. <lb/></body>

T <lb/>cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells (i.e., monocytes and <lb/>macrophages) exhibited higher levels of endogenous 2-HG <lb/>compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and these <lb/>levels could be further increased by supplementation with <lb/>D-2-HG, demonstrating that the cells had a capacity for <lb/>active uptake of this metabolite (Figure 1A). <lb/>We, therefore, investigated whether high exogenous D-2-<lb/>HG levels might alter monocyte to DC differentiation over <lb/>a 7-day culture period with interleukin-4 and granulo-<lb/>cyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. It has been <lb/>reported that D-2-HG does not affect murine DC differen-<lb/>tiation. 15 Here, we compared differentiation of human blood <lb/>monocytes into DC with differentiation of murine (C57BL/6) <lb/>bone marrow cells to bone marrow-derived DC. D-2-HG <lb/>did not affect the viability of either murine or human DC <lb/>(Figure 1B), but cell yields measured by CASY cell counting <lb/>technology were slightly lower for murine bone marrow-de-<lb/>rived DC treated with D-2-HG (Online Supplementary Figure <lb/>S1A). Interestingly, electron microscopy revealed profound <lb/>changes in cell morphology with significantly decreased <lb/>numbers of vacuoles and impaired dendrite formation in <lb/>D-2-HG-treated human DC compared to untreated con-<lb/>trols (Figure 1C, Online Supplementary Figure S1B).

        <body>field microscopic analysis of murine bone marrow-derived <lb/>DC revealed no changes in cell morphology between cells <lb/>treated with D-2-HG or untreated controls (Online Sup-<lb/>plementary Figure S1B). <lb/>To assess whether D-2-HG could also affect early myeloid <lb/>progenitor cells, we analyzed the impact of D-2-HG on <lb/>differentiation of human CD34 + hematopoietic stem and <lb/>progenitor cells in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. After <lb/>plating defined numbers of CD34 + cells, burst-forming units <lb/>and colony-forming units (CFU) were scored on day 14. <lb/>D-2-HG treatment resulted in a considerably lower num-<lb/>ber of CFC when compared to control (median 5.0 vs. 14.5 <lb/>CFC/100 CD34 + cells; P=0.057) and colonies were smaller in <lb/>size (Online Supplementary Figure S1C, D). Of note, D-2-HG <lb/>resulted in a marked reduction of CFU-granulocyte-mac-<lb/>rophage myeloid progenitors (3.8% vs. 33.9%), while the <lb/>proportion of CFU-erythroid (45.5% vs. 89.1%) increased <lb/>(Online Supplementary Figure S1C, D). <lb/>D-2-hydroxyglutarate limits MHC class II expression in <lb/>human but not murine dendritic cells and impairs T-cell <lb/>stimulation <lb/>To further evaluate the effects of D-2-HG on human and <lb/>murine DC differentiation, we analyzed cell surface expres-<lb/>sion of the MHC class II antigen HLA-DP and its murine <lb/>equivalent in immature human and murine DC. Upregulation <lb/>of HLA-DP during human monocyte to DC differentiation <lb/>was significantly blocked in D-2-HG-treated cells (P&lt;0.001) <lb/>(Figure 1D, E). In contrast to human DC, surface expression <lb/>of the HLA-DP analog I-A/I-E was not significantly impaired <lb/>on murine bone marrow-derived DC (P=0.25) (Figure 1D, <lb/>E). Based on these results we analyzed the expression of <lb/>other MHC class II molecules on human DC. In line with <lb/>the findings for HLA-DP, the expression of HLA-DQ and <lb/>-DR was also significantly reduced on day 7 after D-2-HG <lb/>treatment (Figure 1F, Online Supplementary Figure S1E). <lb/>Surface expression of MHC class I molecules also decreased <lb/>during D-2-HG treatment but the decrease did not reach <lb/>statistical significance (Online Supplementary Figure S1F). <lb/>Furthermore, D-2-HG prevented upregulation of other DC <lb/>markers such as CD1a and DC-SIGN (Online Supplementary <lb/>Figure S1G, H). CD14, a monocyte marker that is downregu-<lb/>lated during DC differentiation, was lost after 4 days even in <lb/>the presence of D-2-HG (Online Supplementary Figure S1I). <lb/>Next, we analyzed the cytokine profile of D-2-HG-treated <lb/>DC. DC were activated with lipopolysaccharide for 24 h and <lb/>cytokine levels were measured in culture supernatants. <lb/>Similar to the already described short-term effects of D-2-<lb/>HG, 22 interleukin-12 production was significantly reduced <lb/>by D-2-HG after 7 days (84%, P=0.002), whereas interleu-<lb/>kin-10 secretion was increased in three out of six donors. <lb/>Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 production was not <lb/>influenced by D-2-HG treatment (Figure 1G). Interestingly, <lb/>in line with low interleukin-12 secretion and MHC class II <lb/>expression, D-2-HG-treated DC were less efficient stimu-<lb/>lators in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction with CD4 <lb/>T cells, resulting in significantly lower T-cell proliferation <lb/>(70% that of controls) and interferon-γ secretion (reduced by <lb/>approximately 45%) (Figure 1H, I). Overall, D-2-HG affected <lb/>the morphology and maturation of human DC, correlating <lb/>with an impaired ability to stimulate T cells. <lb/>D-2-hydroxyglutarate reprograms metabolism and DNA <lb/>demethylation during dendritic cell differentiation <lb/>Metabolic processes are crucial for activation and differen-<lb/>tiation of immune cells and metabolic changes also occur <lb/>during DC differentiation. DC exhibit a marked increase in <lb/>the number of mitochondria and respiration compared to <lb/>monocytes, whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is <lb/>reduced when DC become activated during maturation. 23 We <lb/>therefore hypothesized that D-2-HG might block DC differen-<lb/>tiation and function via metabolic alterations. To verify this, <lb/>we measured the levels of amino acids, glucose, pyruvate, <lb/>and lactate in cell culture supernatants of DC differentiat-<lb/>ed in the presence or absence of D-2-HG. Treatment with <lb/>D-2-HG resulted in accelerated glucose metabolism with <lb/>significantly lower glucose (median 7.5 mM vs. 0.77 mM) and <lb/>higher lactate (median 4.4 mM vs. 16.2 mM) levels in DC cul-<lb/>ture supernatants (Figure 2A). Thus, D-2-HG might contribute <lb/>to the recently reported strong glycolytic activity of myeloid <lb/>cells in the tumor environment. 24 In addition, D-2-HG-treated <lb/>DC produced significantly less alanine (median 473.1 μM vs. <lb/>392.5 μM) and consumed more arginine (median 707.6 μM <lb/>vs. 606.6 μM) (Figure 2A). The concentrations of essential <lb/>amino acids were not altered by D-2-HG treatment (Online <lb/>Supplementary Figure S2A). <lb/>In line with higher lactate levels, the expression of LDH subunit <lb/>A (LDHA) was increased (Figure 2B, C). LDH is transcription-<lb/>ally regulated by MYC 25 and MYC expression increased in the <lb/>presence of D-2-HG during DC culture and was significantly <lb/>upregulated on day 7 (Figure 2B, D). This was accompanied by <lb/>a significant drop in pH after 3-5 days of culture in the pres-<lb/>ence of D-2-HG (Figure 2E). A similar trend was observed with <lb/>the L-enantiomer L-2-HG. At the end of the 2-HG-treated DC <lb/>culture, acidification was comparable to that of DC cultures <lb/>supplemented with 10 mM lactic acid (Figure 2E). In addition, <lb/>D-2-HG and L-2-HG did not change oxygen consumption <lb/>(Online Supplementary Figure S2B). <lb/>As D-2-HG is produced by mutated IDH, we analyzed DC <lb/>expressing mutated IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q upon RNA <lb/>transfection by high-resolution respirometry. Basic oxygen <lb/>consumption (ROUTINE respiration) of DC expressing mu-<lb/>tated IDH1 and IDH2 was increased compared to that of DC <lb/>expressing wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Online Supplementary <lb/>Figure S2C). To compare the effects of D-2-HG produced <lb/>endogenously or added exogenously, we also analyzed D-2-<lb/>HG-treated DC by high-resolution respirometry.

        <body>tion of reactive oxygen species. However, no significant <lb/>change in the formation of reactive oxygen species was <lb/>observed (Online Supplementary Figure S2E). In summary, <lb/>D-2-HG treatment led to higher glycolytic and respiratory <lb/>activity of DC. <lb/>Mitochondria are involved in epigenetic modulation, as they <lb/>generate acetyl-CoA and sustain S-adenosylmethionine pro-<lb/>duction used for the acetylation and methylation of histones <lb/>and DNA, respectively. Loss of DNA methylation occurs during <lb/>differentiation of human monocytes into DC and is linked to <lb/>the expression of TET2. 21 It is known that D-2-HG blocks key <lb/>enzymes of DNA demethylation such as TET-family 5-methyl-<lb/>cytosine hydroxylases. 8 We therefore investigated the impact <lb/>of D-2-HG on DNA demethylation during DC differentiation <lb/>in the absence or presence of vitamin C, a cofactor of TET2 <lb/>known to increase its activity. We observed a pattern of delayed <lb/>demethylation of D-2-HG-treated DC at loci that normally <lb/>become demethylated during DC differentiation, such as <lb/>CLEC10A, CCL13, CD207 and C10ORF78 (Figure 2F). Vitamin C <lb/>accelerated demethylation of all genes analyzed and partially <lb/>counteracted the inhibitory effect of D-2-HG on methylation <lb/>and ROUTINE respiration (Figure 2F, Online Supplementary <lb/>Figure S2F). As expected, the methylation status of two loci <lb/>that were not changed during differentiation (MMP7 and HOXB1) <lb/>was also not modulated by D-2-HG (Online Supplementary <lb/>Figure S2G, H). These data indicate that D-2-HG delays DNA <lb/>demethylation during monocyte to DC differentiation, which <lb/>may contribute to its strong impact on differentiation. <lb/>Modulating dendritic cell metabolism with vitamin C and <lb/>lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors <lb/>Culture medium of DC treated with either D-2-HG or L-2-<lb/>HG exhibited a lowered pH and we therefore compared <lb/>lactate levels in the corresponding supernatants. Lactate <lb/>was elevated in culture supernatants of DC treated with <lb/>both enantiomers (Figure 3A) and both enantiomers low-<lb/>ered HLA-DR and HLA-DP expression of DC (Figure 3B, C). <lb/>To clarify a possible role of lactic acid in the regulation of <lb/>MHC class II molecules, we supplemented DC cultures with <lb/>10 mM lactic acid, which significantly reduced HLA-DR and <lb/>HLA-DP expression (Figure 3B, C) in line with a comparable <lb/>extracellular pH in DC cultures supplemented with either <lb/>2-HG or lactic acid (Figure 2E). <lb/>As vitamin C partially rescued the D-2-HG-induced delay <lb/>in demethylation during DC differentiation, we investigated <lb/>whether vitamin C treatment would be able to rescue the <lb/>metabolic phenotype and DC marker expression. Vitamin <lb/>C reduced the elevated ROUTINE respiration in HG-treated <lb/>DC cultures (Online Supplementary Figure S2F) but lactate <lb/>levels in supernatants were still higher than those in the <lb/>DC control (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, DC marker expression <lb/>was partially restored (Figure 3D-K). <lb/>Next we tried to counteract the suppressive effect of <lb/>D-2-HG by treating DC with the selective LDHA inhibitor <lb/>GNE140 (1 μM). 26 Combined treatment with GNE140 and <lb/>vitamin C resulted in a significant decrease in lactate <lb/>levels (Figure 3A). The viability of DC was diminished by <lb/>vitamin C treatment, but not by D-2-HG and GNE140 (On-<lb/>line Supplementary Figure S3A). GNE140 or vitamin C alone <lb/>increased the D-2-HG-impaired expression of MHC class II, <lb/>CD1a and DC-SIGN and combined treatment with vitamin <lb/>C and GNE140 raised the expression levels almost back to <lb/>control levels for HLA-DR (94%) and CD1a (89%) (Figure <lb/>3H-K). HLA-DP and DC-SIGN expression was improved and <lb/>no longer significantly decreased, but did not reach control <lb/>levels. Similar effects were found with the pyrazole-based <lb/>LDHA/B inhibitor NCI-737 (0.1 μM) in combination with vi-<lb/>tamin C. NCI-737 lowered lactate secretion Figure3A and <lb/>partially reverted MHC class II expression (Online Supple-<lb/>mentary Figure S3B-E). Overall, LDH inhibition was able to <lb/>strengthen the effects of vitamin C and led to a consistent <lb/>improvement of MHC class II expression in human DC. <lb/>Exogenous D-2-hydroxyglutarate treatment inversely <lb/>regulates lactate production and MHC class II expression <lb/>in primary IDH wild-type acute myeloid leukemia cells <lb/>As D-2-HG strongly affected the metabolism of mono-<lb/>cyte-derived DC, we asked whether this also held true for <lb/>primary AML blasts. We, therefore, measured amino acid <lb/>and glucose metabolite levels in the supernatants of IDH <lb/>wild-type AML cells cultured in the presence of D-2-HG. <lb/>D-2-HG significantly elevated glucose metabolism and in-<lb/>creased lactate levels in AML cells (lactate 8.99 mM vs. 14.1 <lb/>mM), in line with the effects observed in DC (Figure 4A). <lb/>Induction of lactate production and secretion in AML blasts <lb/>was not as pronounced as in DC, likely a consequence of <lb/>the already much higher basal supernatant levels of lac-<lb/>tate of AML cells compared to DC. In contrast to DC, we <lb/>observed no alterations in amino acid levels (Figure 4A, <lb/>Online Supplementary Figure S4A). The effects of D-2-HG <lb/>on DC and AML cells are summarized in the heatmap in <lb/>Online Supplementary Figure S4B; metabolite levels were <lb/>detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

First, we determined <lb/>the endogenous levels of 2-HG in patients&apos; AML cells. As <lb/>expected, 2-HG levels were significantly higher in IDH1-and <lb/>IDH2-mutated blasts than in wild-type cells (wild-type 0.001 <lb/>vs. IDH1-mutated 8.67 vs. IDH2-mutated 13.43) (Figure 5A). <lb/>Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA sequencing data <lb/>revealed no significant differences between IDH-mutated and <lb/>wild-type AML blasts regarding HLA-DP, -DQ and -DR α and <lb/>β gene expression or the central regulator of CIITA (Figure 5B, <lb/>C). However, on the protein level, expression of HLA-DP (10.5 <lb/>vs. 1.0) was significantly lower in IDH-mutated blasts, while <lb/>that of HLA-DQ (4 vs. 5.5) and HLA-DR (10 vs. 3.5) was not <lb/>altered (Figure 5D). In line with the lower levels of surface <lb/>HLA-DP, overall HLA-DP protein expression was diminished <lb/>in AML blasts as analyzed by western blot (Figure 5E). <lb/>HLA-DP is an important allo-antigen that stimulates graft-ver-<lb/>sus-leukemia effects. 28 Frequent HLA-DP mismatches be-<lb/>tween patients and donors make HLA-DP targeted therapy <lb/>clinically attractive for patients undergoing hematopoietic <lb/>stem cell transplantation and we previously showed that <lb/>HLA-DPB1-specific T cells are able to specifically target <lb/>allogeneic mismatched antigens on AML blasts. 29 Hence, <lb/>we performed a T-cell-mediated AML killing assay to study <lb/>the immune escape of IDH-mutated HLA-DPB1*04:01 + AML <lb/>blasts using T cells expressing an HLA-DPB1*04:01-specif-<lb/>ic T-cell receptor upon RNA electroporation. 30 In line with <lb/>the significantly decreased HLA-DP protein expression, <lb/>HLA-DP-specific lysis of IDH mutated AML blasts by T-cell <lb/>receptor-modified T cells was clearly reduced when com-<lb/>pared to that of IDH wild-type AML blasts (Figure 5F, G). <lb/>Vitamin C impairs the survival of acute myeloid <lb/>leukemia cells and a combination of vitamin C and <lb/>GNE140 upregulates MHC class II expression <lb/>As GNE140 and vitamin C treatment partially rescued MHC <lb/>class II expression on D-2-HG-treated DC, we analyzed <lb/>whether GNE140 and vitamin C treatment would also in-<lb/>crease MHC class II expression on primary AML cells. Culture <lb/>of AML cells for 4 to 7 days, even without treatment, reduced <lb/>cell survival, but vitamin C and co-treatment with GNE140 <lb/>further diminished the number of living cells, especially <lb/>in IDH-mutated AML (Figure 6A-C, Online Supplementary <lb/>Figure S5A-C). HLA-DP expression of cultured living AML <lb/>cells tended to be higher, and HLA-DR was significantly <lb/>increased after 7 days of treatment with GNE140/vitamin <lb/>C (Figure 6D, E). These data suggest that MHC class II ex-<lb/>pression is linked to glucose metabolism and lactate levels <lb/>not only in non-malignant DC but also in AML cells. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Mutated IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes convert α-KG to the <lb/>structurally similar D-2-HG, which competitively inhibits <lb/>several ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and, thereby, <lb/>limits histone and DNA demethylation, which is known to <lb/>impair hematopoietic differentiation. 9,11 DNA methylation <lb/>analysis during the differentiation of human monocytes to <lb/>DC also revealed a delayed demethylation pattern in DC in <lb/>the presence of D-2-HG. Vitamin C, a co-factor of Fe 2+ and <lb/>α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, is known to improve TET2 <lb/>activity 31 and Gerecke et al. combined an IDH1 inhibitor <lb/>with vitamin C to increase demethylation in HCT116 cells <lb/>carrying a heterozygote IDH1 R132H mutation. 32 In our ex-<lb/>periments, vitamin C could only partially revert the effect <lb/>of D-2-HG on DC, which might be related to the D-2-HG-<lb/>induced and persistent glycolytic phenotype with elevated <lb/>MYC expression and lactate levels. <lb/>Beyond epigenetic modifications, several studies have <lb/>demonstrated that exogenous or endogenous D-2-HG or <lb/>L-2-HG has a strong impact on (tumor) cell metabolism. <lb/>Both 2-HG enantiomers inhibited ATP synthase (complex <lb/>V) in human glioblastoma and other neuronal cells. 33,34 In <lb/>addition, primary AML blasts with IDH1/2 mutations exhib-<lb/>ited lower cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV). 35 In <lb/>contrast, our own data showed that overexpression of IDH1 <lb/>R132H and IDH2 R140Q resulted in a higher oxygen consump-<lb/>tion rate. Furthermore, exogenous D-2-HG treatment also <lb/>increased basal respiration of monocyte-derived DC. Similar <lb/>results have been reported for primary human T cells, where <lb/>2-HG treatment shifted metabolism from aerobic glycoly-<lb/>sis towards respiration, 36 indicating that non-transformed <lb/>cells might react differently from malignant hematopoi-<lb/>etic cells with an already altered metabolism. However, in <lb/>a recently published study, IDH1-mutated AML cells also <lb/>showed higher OXPHOS, 37 which has been described for <lb/>other tumor entities harboring an IDH1 mutation. 38 Be-<lb/>sides OXPHOS, decreased glycolysis and downregulation <lb/>of LDHB were demonstrated in the NOMO-1 leukemia cell <lb/>line and patients&apos; IDH wild-type AML cells after incuba-<lb/>tion with 2-HG, whereas in NB4 leukemia cells glycolysis <lb/>was supported. 39 In glioma, LDHA seems to be silenced <lb/>by promoter methylation in IDH-mutated tumors which <lb/>in turn should result in limited glycolysis. 40 These results <lb/>suggest that effects of 2-HG on OXPHOS and glycolysis <lb/>are both context-and cell type-dependent. <lb/>Our own data show that exogenous D-2-HG promotes not <lb/>only OXPHOS but also glycolysis. Accelerated glycolysis in an <lb/>early phase of differentiation disturbed development from <lb/>monocytes to DC and limited MHC class II expression.

        <body>lactic acid could inhibit DC in a paracrine fashion, as lac-<lb/>tic acid directly blocks DC differentiation. 27 However, in a <lb/>later phase of DC differentiation, glycolysis seems to be of <lb/>crucial importance and is a prerequisite for DC migration. 41 <lb/>The balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis is under the <lb/>control of transcription factors such as MYC or hypoxia <lb/>inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). 42 Interestingly, previous papers <lb/>have already linked single nucleotide polymorphisms at <lb/>8q24.21 with MYC deregulation and greater risk of IDH-mu-<lb/>tant glioma formation. 43 <lb/>O&apos;Neill and colleagues found that endogenous 2-HG levels <lb/>increased in lipopolysaccharide-activated murine macro-<lb/>phages and supported a highly glycolytic metabolic state <lb/>through activation of the transcription factor HIF-1α. 44 In <lb/>our experiments, DC expressed almost no HIF-1α (data not <lb/>shown), but upregulated MYC after exposure to exogenous <lb/>the indicated effector (T cell)-to-target (AML blast) ratios.

        <body>D-2-HG, which was also accompanied by high glycolytic <lb/>activity and low MHC class II expression. In line with this, <lb/>tolerogenic DC induced by dexamethasone treatment showed <lb/>higher MYC expression associated with elevated interleukin-10 <lb/>secretion. 45 An interplay between MYC and 2-HG metabolism <lb/>has been reported by Qiu and colleagues. Here, MYC induced <lb/>the transcription of L/D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, <lb/>which can degrade 2-HG. 46 Thus, it is tempting to speculate <lb/>that MYC is increased by D-2-HG to reduce intracellular 2-HG <lb/>levels and, thereby, limit the negative effects of 2-HG on <lb/>DC. D-2-HG-treated DC upregulated MYC expression around <lb/>day 4, suggesting that MYC could be responsible for LDHA <lb/>induction and the observed accelerated glycolytic activity, <lb/>as LDHA is a known c-MYC-responsive gene. 25 On the other <lb/>hand, LDHA activity itself and concomitant acidification <lb/>might induce MYC, given that a low pH value stabilizes the <lb/>deubiquitinase ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 28 <lb/>(USP28), which leads to deubiquitination of MYC and MYC <lb/>protein stabilization. 47 However, applying different types of <lb/>glycolytic inhibitors we could not consistently block the <lb/>upregulation of MYC (data not shown). <lb/>The higher MYC levels in D-2-HG-treated DC may also partially <lb/>explain the lower MHC class II expression, since MYC-over-<lb/>expressing cells exhibit lower MHC class II expression, which <lb/>also reduces immune recognition of B-cell lymphomas. 48 The <lb/>relevance of 2-HG for regulation of MHC class II expression <lb/>is underlined by our finding that AML blasts with mutated <lb/>IDH and high endogenous levels of 2-HG exhibit low MHC <lb/>class II expression. It is well known that solid tumors, as well <lb/>as AML blasts, induce immune escape by downregulation <lb/>of their MHC molecules 49 and expression of MHC class II <lb/>molecules is lower in relapsed AML. 50 Our data may in part <lb/>explain the downregulation of MHC class II expression in <lb/>IDH-mutated AML blasts and other malignancies with D-2-<lb/>HG accumulation, resulting in decreased T-cell recognition <lb/>and immune control. In line, T-cell infiltration was improved <lb/>by an IDH1 inhibitor in a glioma mouse model. 51 Recently, <lb/>Friedrich et al. described D-2-HG-dependent activation of <lb/>the kynurenine pathway and tryptophan degradation leading <lb/>to re-education of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. 14 In lipo-<lb/>polysaccharide/interferon-stimulated human macrophages <lb/>D-2-HG also reduced HLA-DR expression and an IDH inhibitor <lb/>partially reversed low HLA-DR expression on macrophages in <lb/>a murine model. Interestingly, similar results were obtained <lb/>by Kadiyala et al. in an IDH1 R132H-mutated glioma mouse <lb/>model in which IDH inhibitor treatment resulted in higher <lb/>DC infiltration and upregulation of MHC class II molecules. 52 <lb/>IDH-related D-2-HG production seems to represent a meta-<lb/>bolic strategy to lower MHC class II expression and suppress <lb/>the anti-tumor response. <lb/>The expression of MHC class II molecules is not only im-<lb/>portant for recognition of solid tumors, but also necessary <lb/>for immune control of AML. Previous studies analyzing <lb/>the impact of HLA-DP mismatch constellations between <lb/>patients and donors demonstrated an important role of <lb/>HLA-DP for the graft-versus-leukemia effect but also its <lb/>role in immune escape. 28,29,50,53,54 <lb/>When testing allo-HLA-DP β chain-specific T cells with pri-<lb/>mary AML blasts, we observed low HLA-DP expression and <lb/>poor T-cell recognition in a group of patients with mutated <lb/>IDH. Further studies revealed that exogenous D-2-HG also <lb/>stimulated glycolysis and reduced MHC class II expression <lb/>in wild-type AML cells. However, in contrast to monocytes <lb/>and monocyte-derived DC, the basal glycolytic activity was <lb/>much higher in AML blasts. Enhanced glycolysis is a common <lb/>feature in AML and a predictor of poor prognosis. 55 Glycolysis <lb/>also leads to leukemia-derived lactic acid secretion, which <lb/>interferes with T-cell activity and proliferation. 56 Therefore, <lb/>targeting glycolysis and acidification is discussed as a novel <lb/>strategy not only for AML, as altered glucose metabolism is <lb/>closely associated with therapeutic resistance. <lb/>We tested whether glycolytic inhibition could counteract the <lb/>effects of D-2-HG and rescue MHC class II expression during <lb/>differentiation of monocytes to DC and in AML blasts. As ex-<lb/>pected, the LDH inhibitor GNE140 reduced lactate secretion <lb/>and supported MHC class II, CD1a and DC-SIGN expression <lb/>in DC and MHC class II expression in primary AML blasts. <lb/>Hence, the effect of D-2-HG on the epigenetic landscape <lb/>of differentiating monocytes likely contributes to the al-<lb/>tered phenotype observed. Epigenetic modulators, histone <lb/>deacetylase inhibitors, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors <lb/>can increase MHC class II expression on ovarian cancer <lb/>cells. 57 As vitamin C partly rescued the of D-2-HG effects <lb/>on DNA methylation and normalized respiration, we com-<lb/>bined vitamin C with the LDH inhibitor GNE140. <lb/>The co-treatment with vitamin C and GNE140 had positive <lb/>effects on CD1a and MHC class II expression in DC, but did <lb/>not fully normalize their levels of expression. Similar results <lb/>were obtained with another LDH inhibitor (NCI-737) that tar-<lb/>gets both LDHA and LDHB in DC. In addition, vitamin C and <lb/>GNE140 administration supported MHC class II expression <lb/>in AML cells. However, cell count was severely diminished <lb/>by vitamin C. Similar data have shown that pharmacological <lb/>concentrations of vitamin C kill cancer cells but not normal <lb/>cells. 58 DNA methyltransferase inhibitors might further sup-<lb/>port MHC class II expression, and thereby improve antitumor <lb/>immunity in AML with IDH mutations. As IDH inhibitors have <lb/>been shown to limit therapy response to radiotherapy, PARP <lb/>inhibitors or chemotherapy, it might be a new treatment <lb/>option to target 2-HG-induced metabolic alterations in <lb/>IDH-mutated tumor cells instead of using IDH inhibition. 59,60 <lb/>In summary, exogenous D-2-HG inhibits the differentiation <lb/>of DC and induces a tolerogenic phenotype with low MHC <lb/>class II expression as a result of epigenetic and metabolic <lb/>reprogramming. A similar phenotype was found in primary <lb/>AML blasts with mutated IDH and endogenous D-2-HG <lb/>production. The combination of LDH inhibitors with the <lb/>antioxidant/epigenetic modulator vitamin C could partial-<lb/>ly rescue the effect of D-2-HG in DC and supported MHC <lb/>class II expression in AML blasts.
