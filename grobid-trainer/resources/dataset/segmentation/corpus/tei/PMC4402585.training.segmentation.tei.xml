			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in numer-<lb/>ous biological processes, including axis formation, cell fate <lb/>specification, cell polarity determination, and cell migra-<lb/>tion [1]. Pathologically, Wnt signaling pathway is fre-<lb/>quently aberrant in wide spectrum of malignancies, such as <lb/>colon cancer, liver cancer, leukemia, melanoma, pancreatic <lb/>cancer, and breast cancer [2]. Thus, screening inhibitors of <lb/>Wnt signaling pathway has been considered as effective <lb/>therapeutic strategies to combat cancer [3]. <lb/>Traditionally, the roots of Cimicifuga foetida have been <lb/>used as a cooling and detoxifying remedy and officially <lb/>listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [4]. The theory of <lb/>traditional Chinese medicine defines a tumor as a type of <lb/>toxin. Base on this theory, we hypothesized that chemical <lb/>constituents of Cimicifuga may have the effects against <lb/>cancer, which led us to uncover a series of 9,19-cycloartane <lb/>triterpenes. Many of them showed cytotoxic activity <lb/>against tumor cell lines, in which five compounds isolated <lb/>from C. yunnanensis induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells via <lb/>p53-dependent mitochondrial pathway, recently [5-14]. <lb/>However, there have been no reports about the Wnt sig-<lb/>naling pathway inhibitory activity of 9,19-cycloartane <lb/>triterpenes by far. Therefore, to further screen inhibitors <lb/>against Wnt signaling pathway from Cimicifuga spp., we <lb/>carried out a study on the roots of Cimicifuga foetida from <lb/>Yulong County of Yunnan province. Consequently, four <lb/>new compounds, cimilactone E (1), cimicilactone F (2), <lb/>2(E)-O-butenoyl-23-epi-26-deoxyactein (3), 2 0 -O-acetyl-<lb/>cimirace-moside H (4), and four known compounds cimi-<lb/>cilactone A (5) [15], 12b-hydroxy-7(8)-en-cimigenol (6) <lb/>[16], cimicifoetiside B (7) [17], and 2 0 -O-acetyl cimirace-<lb/>moside M (8) [18] (see Fig. 1) were isolated from C. <lb/>foetida. Furthermore, all compounds isolated were <lb/>evaluated for their inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway. <lb/>Among them, compounds 7 and 8 showed significant in-<lb/>hibitory activities (see Fig. 2), with IC 50 values of 3.33 and <lb/></body>

			<body>13.34 lM, respectively. The present paper described the <lb/>isolation, structure elucidation, and biological activities of <lb/>aforementioned compounds. <lb/>2 Results and Discussion <lb/>Compound 1 was obtained as a white powder. The IR <lb/>spectrum showed absorptions for hydroxyl groups at <lb/>3438 cm -1 and carbonyl groups at 1735 cm -1 , respec-<lb/>tively. Its molecular formula (C 35 H 52 O 10 ) with ten degrees <lb/>of unsaturation was deduced from HREIMS (m/z 632.3533 <lb/>[M] ? ; calcd. 632.3560). In 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1), <lb/>the characteristic cyclopropane methylene signals at d H <lb/>0.15 and 0.50 (each 1H, d, J = 4.3 Hz), one secondary <lb/>methyl signal at d H 0.98 (d, J = 6.4 Hz), four tertiary <lb/>methyl groups at d H 0.84-1.26 (each 3H, s), an anomeric <lb/>proton at d H 4.83 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz) and two acetyl <lb/>methyl groups at d H 2.16 and 2.18 (each 3H, s) were ob-<lb/>served. The 13 C NMR and DEPT spectra of 1 exhibited 35 <lb/>signals, of which 26 were attributed to the aglycon, five to a <lb/>pentose residue, and four to two acetyl groups. The <lb/>13 C NMR and DEPT spectrum of the aglycon of 1 also <lb/>showed an ester carbonyl carbon at d C 174.2 and two <lb/>acetoxy carbonyl groups at d C 171.1 and 170.5. The <lb/>aforementioned data suggested that 1 was a 9,19-cycloar-<lb/>tane tetranortriterpene glycoside with three carbonyl <lb/>groups. The NMR spectroscopic data of 1 (Table 1) closely <lb/>resembled that of cimilactone A (5), except for the pres-<lb/>ence of an additional acetoxy group. In the HMBC spec-<lb/>trum (Fig. 3), a correlation was observed between the <lb/>proton at d H 4.87 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-1 0 ) and the me-<lb/>thine carbon at d C 88.8 (C-3), suggesting that the sugar <lb/>moiety was located at C-3.

			<body>correlations of a downfield resonance at d H 5.58 (1H, dd, <lb/>J = 8.0 and 9.0 Hz, H-2 0 ) with H-3 0 (d H 4.20, m) and H-1 0 <lb/>(d H 4.83, d, J = 8.0 Hz), together with the HMBC corre-<lb/>lations from the proton resonance (H-2 0 ) to a carbonyl <lb/>group (d C 170.5, s) located the acetoxy group at C-2 0 . The <lb/>sugar obtained after acid hydrolysis was identified as D-<lb/>xylose by comparing its TLC and specific rotation with a <lb/>standard. The relative configurations of H-3, H-5, H-12, <lb/>H-16, and H-17 were established as in the a-orientation on <lb/>the basis of the ROESY correlations of H-1 0 /H-3; H-3/H-5; <lb/>H-12/H-17; H-16/H-17 and H-17/Me-18 (Fig. 3). There-<lb/>fore, the structure of 1 was determined to be (3b,12b,16b)-<lb/>12,2 0 -diacetoxy-3-hydroxy-24,25,26,27-tetranor-cycloartan-<lb/>23,16-olide 3-O-b-D-xylopyranside (1), named cimilactone E. <lb/>Compound 2 was obtained as a white powder. The IR <lb/>spectrum showed absorptions for hydroxyl (3442 cm -1 ), <lb/>carbonyl group (1732 cm -1 ), and double bond <lb/>(1632 cm -1 ), respectively. The HREIMS spectrum gave an <lb/>[M] ? ion peak at m/z 658.3713 (calcd 658.3717), consistent <lb/>with the molecular formula C 37 H 54 O 10 , requiring eleven <lb/>rings or sites of unsaturation. The NMR data of 2 was <lb/>similar to cimilactone E (1), except for the resonances of <lb/>the sugar moiety. The 13 C NMR spectrum revealed carbons <lb/>assignable to a 2-butenoyl moiety at d C 165.8 (s), 123.6 (d), <lb/>144.8 (d). Besides, the correlation from the proton reso-<lb/>nance (d H 5.68, dd, J = 7.9 and 9.0 Hz, H-2 0 ) to the car-<lb/>bonyl group (d C 166.2, s, C-1 00 ) in the HMBC spectrum <lb/>located the 2-butenoyl group at C-2 0 , which was further <lb/>confirmed by the 1 H-1 H COSY correlations of the proton at <lb/>d H 5.68 (H-2 0 ) with H-1 0 and H-3 0 . In addition, the coupling <lb/>constant (J = 15.6 Hz) of the two olefinic protons at d H <lb/>6.12 (H-2 00 ) and d H 7.14 (H-3 00 ) confirmed the E-geometry <lb/>of a double bond in the 2-butenoyl moiety.

			<body>H-17 were proposed as a-orientation, respectively, by <lb/>same way as that of 1. Therefore, the structure of 2 was <lb/>identified as (3b,12b,16b)-12-acetoxy-3-hydroxy-24,25,26,27-<lb/>tetranor-cycloartan-23,16-olide-3-O-{2 0 -O-(E)-2 00 -butenoyl}-b-<lb/>D-xylopyran-side (2), named cimilactone F. <lb/>Compound 3, was obtained as white powder, which <lb/>gave an [M] ? ion at m/z 728.4120 [M] ? (calcd 728.4120) <lb/>in HREIMS, consistent with the molecular formula of <lb/>C 41 H 60 O 11 . The IR spectra showed absorption bands for <lb/>hydroxyl groups at 3442 cm -1 , carbonyl groups at <lb/>1730 cm -1 and double bond at 1632 cm -1 , respectively. <lb/>Typical proton signals of a cyclopropane methylene group <lb/>(d H 0.14 and 0.44, each 1H, d, J = 4.3 Hz); five tertiary <lb/>methyl groups (d H 0.83-1.47, each 3H, s); two secondary <lb/>methyl group [(d H 1.02 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz) and 1.67 (3H, <lb/>d, J = 6.6 Hz)]; one acetyl methyl group (d H 2.15, 3H, s); <lb/>one 2(E)-butenoyl group [d H 6.11 (1H, dd, J = 1.6 and <lb/>15.5 Hz), 7.12 (m) and 16.7 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz)], and an <lb/>anomeric proton (d H 4.88, 1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz) were ob-<lb/>served in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1). The 13 C NMR <lb/>and DEPT spectrum (Table 1) of 3 exhibited 41 signals, of <lb/>which 30 were attributed to the aglycon, five to a pentose <lb/>residue, two to an acetyl group, and four to an 2-butenoyl <lb/>group. Additionally, the aglycon of 3 also showed a <lb/>hemiketal moiety at d C 74.9 (d), 106.3 (s) and 68.5 (t), and <lb/>an epoxyethane signals at d C 62.6 (d) and 62.9 (s), which <lb/>indicated that the aglycon of 3 was similar with 23-epi-<lb/>deoxyacteol. A comparison of the spectroscopic data of 3 <lb/>with those of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein showed that 3 closely <lb/>resembles of it except for the presence of another tetra-<lb/>carbon unit (2-butenoyl group) [19]. Additionally, the E-<lb/>geometry of a double bond in the 2-butenoyl was con-<lb/>firmed in the same way with that of 2. In 1 H-1 H COSY <lb/>spectrum, the correlations of a resonance at d H 7.12 (m, <lb/>H-3 00 ) with H-2 00 (d H 6.11, dd, J = 1.6 and 15.6 Hz) and <lb/>H-4 00 (d H 1.67, d, J = 6.6 Hz), together with the HMBC <lb/>correlation from the proton resonance (d H 5.67, dd, J = 7.8 <lb/>and 10.2 Hz, H-2 0 ) to a carbonyl group (d C 166.2, s) lo-<lb/>cated the 2(E)-butenoyl group at C-2 0 . Thus, 3 was char-<lb/>acterized as 2 0 -O-2(E)-butenoyl-23-epi-26-deoxyactein (3). <lb/>Compound 4 was obtained as a white powder. The IR <lb/>spectrum showed absorptions for hydroxyl (3439 cm -1 ), <lb/>carbonyl groups (1730 cm -1 ), respectively. Its molecular <lb/>formula (C 39 H 60 O 12 ) with ten degrees of unsaturation was <lb/>deduced from the analyses of 13 C NMR and HREIMS data <lb/>(m/z 720.4078 [M] ? ; calcd. 720.4085). In 1 H NMR spec-<lb/>trum (Table 1), the signals due to a cyclopropane methy-<lb/>lene group (d H 0.15 and 0.46, each 1H, d, J = 3.6 Hz); six <lb/>tertiary methyl groups (d H 0.85-1.79, each 3H, s); one <lb/>secondary methyl group (d H 1.35, 3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz); two <lb/>acetyl methyl group (d H 2.17 and 2.10, each 3H, s); and an <lb/>anomeric proton (d H 4.82, 1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz) were ob-<lb/>served. The 13 C NMR and DEPT spectrum (Table 1) of 4 <lb/>exhibited 39 signals, of which 30 were attributed to the <lb/>aglycon, five to a pentose residue, and four to two acetyl <lb/>groups. All above showed 4 was similar to cimiracemoside <lb/>H, except for the presence of an additional acetoxy group. <lb/>In 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum, the correlations of a resonance <lb/>at d H 4.19 (m, H-3 0 ) with H-2 0 (d H 5.58, t, J = 9.0 Hz) and <lb/>H-4 0 (d H 4.22, m), together with the HMBC correlation <lb/>from a carbonyl group (d C 170.5, 3H, s) to the proton <lb/>resonance (d H 5.58, H-2 0 ) located the acetoxy group at <lb/>C-2 0 . The ROESY correlations of H-17/H-22 and Me-21/ <lb/>H-24 proved H-22 in the a-orientation and H-24 as R con-<lb/>figuration. Therefore, 4 was characterized as (3b,12b, <lb/>16b,20S,22R,23S,24R)-16:23; 22:25-diepoxy-12,2 0 -diace-<lb/>toxy-3,23,24-trihydroxy-9, 19-cyclocanostane-3-O-b-D-xy-<lb/>lopyranoside (4), named 2 0 -O-acetyl cimiracemoside H. <lb/>As noted in the introduction, the roots of C. foetida have <lb/>been used as cooling and detoxification agents by Chinese <lb/>people since ancient time. Previous reports have shown that <lb/>many pure 9,19 cycloartane triterpenoids isolated from this <lb/>species exhibited cytotoxic activity against 11 tumor cell <lb/>lines (including HepG2, MDA-MB-A231, HL-60, SMMC-<lb/>7721, A549, SK-BR-3, PANC-1, K562, U933, HEG-2, and <lb/>SGC-7091) in vitro, respectively [5-7, 17, 20, 21]. But <lb/>there is no report on inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway. <lb/>The pure components isolated in the present paper were <lb/>screened against Wnt signaling pathway using the lu-<lb/>ciferase reporter gene assay. The known compounds 7 and <lb/>8 showed notable activity with the IC 50 values of 3.33 and <lb/>13.34 lM, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this <lb/>is the first time to report the inhibitory activity against Wnt <lb/>signaling pathway of 9,19-cycloartane triterpenes. These <lb/>data suggested that some chemical constituents from C. <lb/>foetida might be valuable to against tumorigenesis through <lb/>inhibition to Wnt signaling pathway. <lb/>3 Experiments Section <lb/>3.1 General Experimental Procedures <lb/>UV spectra were recorded in MeOH on a shimadizu UV-<lb/>210A spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on Shimadzu <lb/>IR-450 spectrometer with KBr disc. Optical rotations were <lb/>measured a Horiba SEAP-300 polarimeter. 1 H NMR and <lb/>13 C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AM-600 <lb/>spectrometer with TMS as internal standard, operating at <lb/>600 and 150 MHz, respectively. All compounds were <lb/>measured in solvents pyridine-d 5 . ESIMS and HRESIMS <lb/>were carried out on a Waters Autospec Premier-P776 <lb/>spectrometer. TLC analysis was performed on silica gel <lb/>GF 254 plate (Qingdao Marine Chemical, Inc.). Lichroprep <lb/>RP-18 (40-63 lm, Merck) and silica gel (200-300 mesh) <lb/>was used for column chromatography. Semipreparative <lb/></body>

The residue yield by removal of the solvent was dis-<lb/>solved in water to form a suspension. The aqueous suspen-<lb/>sion was successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. <lb/>The EtOAc (5.6 kg) fraction was absorbed on 12 kg silica <lb/>gel and chromatographed on a prepacked (120 kg) silica gel <lb/>column, eluting stepwise with CHCl 3 -MeOH (CHCl 3 , <lb/>100:1, 50:1, 20:1, 5:1) to give five fractions (I-V). Fr.IV <lb/>(350 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatograph eluted <lb/>with CHCl 3 -acetone (10: 1) to give five sub-fractions (Fr.IV. <lb/>1-5). Fr.IV.4 (0.5 g) was chromatographed repeatedly over <lb/>HPLC (SB C-18 column, CH 3 CN-H 2 O, 7:3) to obtain <lb/>compound 7 (5 mg) successively. Fr.IV.5 (5 g) was applied <lb/>repeatedly to CC over RP-18 gel (60, 70, 80 and 90 % <lb/>MeOH-H 2 O) to give fractions IV.5.1-4. Fr.IV.5.2 (60 mg) <lb/>afforded compound 6 (5 mg), after repeated elution with a <lb/>CHCl 3 -acetone (5:1, 3:2) system over silica gel CC and a <lb/>CH 3 CN-H 2 O (65 %) over HPLC (SB C-18 column). <lb/>Fr.IV.5.3 (450 mg) was separated by column chromatograph <lb/>eluted with CHCl 3 -acetone (3:1), and by HPLC (SB C-18 <lb/>column) with CH 3 CN/H 2 O (45 %) to obtain compounds 1 <lb/>(10 mg), 4 (2.2 mg) and 5 (3 mg), respectively. Fr.IV.5. 4 <lb/>(380 mg) was also separated by column chromatograph <lb/>eluted with CHCl 3 -acetone (3:1), then HPLC (XDB C-18 <lb/>column) with CH 3 CN-H 2 O (65 %) to yield compounds 2 <lb/>(1.6 mg), 3 (1.8 mg) and 8 (5 mg). <lb/>Compound 1: white powder (MeOH); ½a 20 <lb/>D : -41.67 (c 0.24, <lb/>MeOH); UV (MeOH) k max (log e): 209 (2.32) nm; IR (KBr) <lb/>v max : 3438 (OH), 2964, 1735 (C=O), 1631(C=C), 1442, 1375, <lb/>1242, 1032, 982 cm -1 ; positive HRESIMS m/z 632.3533 <lb/>[M] ? , (C 35 H 52 O 10 , calcd. 632.3560), 1 H and 13 C NMR data, <lb/>see Table 1. <lb/>Compound 2: white powder (MeOH); ½a 20 <lb/>D : -90.67 <lb/>(c 0.06, MeOH); UV (MeOH) k max (log e): 206 (4.29) nm; <lb/>IR (KBr) v max : 3442 (OH), 2963, 2936, 1732 (C=O), <lb/>1655(C=C), 1444, 1365, 1245, 1184, 1072, 984 cm -1 ; <lb/>positive HRESIMS m/z 658.3713 [M] ? , (C 37 H 54 O 10 , calcd. <lb/>658.3717), 1 H and 13 C NMR data, see Table 1. <lb/>Compound 3: white powder (MeOH); ½a 20 <lb/>D : -49.18 <lb/>(c 0.18, MeOH); UV (MeOH) k max (log e): 206 (4.14) nm; <lb/>IR (KBr) v max : 3441 (OH), 2932, 1730 (C=O), 1651(C=C), <lb/>1443, 1365, 1250, 1184, 1072, 1032, 982 cm -1 ; positive <lb/>HRESIMS m/z 728.4120 [M] ? , (C 41 H 60 O 11 , calcd. <lb/>728.4136), 1 H and 13 C NMR data, see Table 1. <lb/>Compound 4: white powder (MeOH); ½a 20 <lb/>D : -19.67 <lb/>(c 0.13, MeOH); UV (MeOH) k max (log e): 201 (3.58) nm; <lb/>IR (KBr) v max : 3439 (OH), 2939, 1735 (C=O), 1632(C=C), <lb/>1462, 1377, 1244, 1159, 1047, 981, 602-576 cm -1 ; posi-<lb/>tive HREIMS m/z 720.4078 [M] ? , (C 39 H 60 O 12 , calcd. <lb/>720.4085), 1 H and 13 C NMR data, see Table 1. <lb/>The known compounds, cimilactone A (5), 12b-hydroxy-<lb/>7(8)-en-cimigenol (6), cmicifoetiside B (7) and 2 0 -O-acetyl <lb/>cimiracemoside M (8) were identified by comparing their <lb/>physical and spectroscopic data with reported data. <lb/>Fig. 3 Key 1 H-1 H COSY, HMBC and ROESY correlations of compound 1 <lb/></body>
