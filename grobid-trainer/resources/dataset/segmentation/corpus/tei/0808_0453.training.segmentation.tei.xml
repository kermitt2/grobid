            <body>The measurements of the W ± and Z 0 bosons in pp and e + e − collisions have allowed precise <lb/>test of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. In pp collisions at the LHC, the convergence <lb/>of the NLO and NNLO calculations offers the possibility to use the total Z 0 cross section for a <lb/>better understanding of the collider luminosity and the acceptance and efficiency of the detectors <lb/>[1]. The high p T electrons emitted in the electronic Z 0 decays can be a controlled observable for <lb/>checks of the p T calibration and resolution between 30 GeV/c and 50 GeV/c. In heavy ion collisions <lb/>Z 0 is a good candidate for an alternative reference for quarkonium study, despite the large mass <lb/>differences, m Z ≫m J/Ψ , and the difference in production mechanisms, mainly q q for Z 0 and gg for <lb/>quarkonium. It should be weakly affected by nuclear shadowing [2] and the presence of the Quark <lb/>Gluon Plasma [3]. In this work, a feasibility study is presented to detect Z 0 through Z 0 →e + e − in <lb/>the central barrel of ALICE. The detection of the W ± and Z 0 bosons through their muon decays <lb/>in the ALICE muon spectrometer has been previously extensively studied [4]. <lb/>The leading order event generator PYTHIA 6.326 [5] is used to simulate the production of Z 0 <lb/>bosons. Only the lowest order Born processes, q q→γ * /Z 0 , have been generated. The parton shower <lb/>algorithm of PYTHIA produces additional jets, that mimic the contributions of higher processes, <lb/>qq→γ * /Zg and q(q)g→γ * /Zq(q). The CTEQ5L PDFs are used. It was shown that the p T and <lb/>y Z 0 distributions measured at Tevatron energies are well reproduced [6]. Pure Z 0 production, <lb/>without the complete γ * /Z 0 interference, has been simulated in this work. Due to the large vector <lb/>boson masses, the contributions of higher order QCD processes can be approximated by a k factor, <lb/>found to be about 1.5 from comparison with measurements in pp collisions. The extrapolated cross <lb/>sections for the LHC are summarized in Tab.I. The yields were calculated taking an inelastic pp <lb/>cross section of 70 mb at 14 TeV. Calculations have been carried out up to NNLO. In the following <lb/>we normalise all the cross section to the NNLO calculations [1]. <lb/>pp at 14 TeV σP Y T HIA [nb] σNNLO [nb] N Xpp <lb/>Z 0 →e + e − <lb/>≈2.4 <lb/>≈1.84 <lb/>3×10 −8 <lb/>W ± →eν <lb/>≈23.8 <lb/>≈19.8 <lb/>3×10 −7 <lb/>TABLE I: Inclusive cross sections times branching ratio obtained with PYTHIA and extrapolated after <lb/>comparison to SppS and Tevatron data, leading to a k factor of 1.5.

The Particle Identification (PID) algorithm used requires that the particles are <lb/>reconstructed in at least five planes of the TRD, which leads to an overall mean reconstruction <lb/>efficiency of 80 %. The p T resolution is about 3.5 % at 100 GeV/c in the nominal 0.5 T magnetic <lb/>field. To identify the electrons, the dE/dx of the TPC and the TRD are used. At such high <lb/>p T , the main difficulty comes from the much more numerous π ± that can be misidentified as <lb/>electrons. The percentage of misidentified π ± , the π ± efficiency ǫ π , is determined for a given e ± <lb/>efficiency, ǫ e . The left panel of Fig.1 shows ǫ T RD <lb/>π ± , as it has been obtained from test beam data <lb/>analysis of small and big chambers [7] and from simulations done within the AliRoot framework <lb/>[8]. The results of a one dimensional likelihood method, L-Q, can be improved by using a two <lb/>dimensional method, L-Q1,Q2 or a neural network, NNs [7]. A fit of the L-Q1,Q2 performances <lb/>allows to extrapolate ǫ T RD <lb/>π <lb/>to the p range of interest for the Z 0 .

A clear signature of Z 0 decays is two high p T isolated electrons. A p T cut at <lb/>25 GeV/c is considered together with an isolation cut. It will reject a track i, if a track j is found <lb/>to have: p j <lb/>T &gt;2 GeV, |η i − η j |≤0.1 and |φ i − φ j |≤0.1 rad. 99 % of the signal survives this cut. Fig.2 <lb/>shows the generated m e + e − <lb/>sim in the total phase space and in the geometrical acceptance with and <lb/>without tracking and PID efficiencies. The reconstructed m e + e − <lb/>rec <lb/>is also plotted for different p T e ± <lb/>cuts. Bremsstrahlung leads to a tail towards lower values of the mass. <lb/>The different sources of background that are investigated in pp collisions at <lb/>√ <lb/>s=14 TeV <lb/>are: reconstructed dielectrons from jets, that can be real electrons or pions misidentified as <lb/>electrons; W →eν events with an associated hadronic jet that results in a second reconstructed <lb/>electron (Br W →eν =10.75 %); Z 0 →τ τ events, in which electrons or misidentified pions from τ <lb/>decays (Br τ →e/π+X =44.0850 %) are combined; electrons and misidentified pions from t t events <lb/>(Br t→bW ≈100 %); simultaneous semielectronic decays of D and D mesons (Br c→eX ≈9.6 %); and <lb/>simultaneous semielectronic decays of B and B mesons (Br b→eX ≈10.86 %). The jets have been <lb/>simulated with the PYTHIA using Tune A CDF, that gives a total cross section of 54.7 mb [9]. <lb/>Due to the high masses of the W boson and the top quark, only the lowest order processes for W <lb/>production (q q′ →W ) and t t production (gg→t t and q q→t t) have been generated with PYTHIA <lb/>and normalised to the NLO cross sections. For the lighter c and b quarks production, contributions <lb/>from higher order corrections, like flavour excitations (qQ→qQ) and gluon splitting (g→Q Q) have <lb/>also been taken into account. The tuned PYTHIA [10] p T spectra of c and b have been compared <lb/>to NLO predictions (HVQMNR program [11]) and found to be softer by an order 10 at very high <lb/>p T . This would result in a contribution of cc and b b about 100 higher in the invariant mass yield. <lb/>The left panel of Fig.3 shows the reconstructed electron spectra. Misidentified π ± from jets <lb/>constitute the main source of reconstructed electrons above 10 GeV/c. Nevertheless they are not <lb/>isolated. The rejection factor of the isolation cut is of the order of 10 4 . The different contributions <lb/>to the dielectron reconstructed invariant mass yield per minimum-bias pp collisions are presented <lb/>in the right panel of Fig.3. A p T cut at 25 GeV/c and the isolation cut are applied. The isolation <lb/>cut suppresses also the correlated background from simultaneous semi-electronic decays of D and <lb/>D, or B and B, mesons, below one percent, even with a factor 100, due to higher order corrections. <lb/>[GeV/c] <lb/>T <lb/>p <lb/>0 <lb/>10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 <lb/>] <lb/>-1 <lb/>[pb.(GeV/c) <lb/>T <lb/>/dp <lb/>σ <lb/>d <lb/>-1 <lb/>10 <lb/>1 <lb/>10 <lb/>2 <lb/>10 <lb/>3 <lb/>10 <lb/>4 <lb/>10 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>6 <lb/>10 <lb/>7 <lb/>10 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>9 <lb/>10 <lb/>total single e <lb/>Z-&gt;ee <lb/>B-&gt;e <lb/>D-&gt;e <lb/>ttbar-&gt;e <lb/>W-&gt;e <lb/>)-&gt;e(X) <lb/>τ <lb/>( <lb/>τ <lb/>Z-&gt; <lb/>misidentified as e <lb/>π <lb/>Jets <lb/>[GeV/c ] <lb/>2 <lb/>inv <lb/>M <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>110 <lb/>120 <lb/>] <lb/>2 <lb/>.c <lb/>-1 <lb/>yield[GeV <lb/>-16 <lb/>10 <lb/>-15 <lb/>10 <lb/>-14 <lb/>10 <lb/>-13 <lb/>10 <lb/>-12 <lb/>10 <lb/>-11 <lb/>10 <lb/>-10 <lb/>10 <lb/>-9 <lb/>10 <lb/>Signal <lb/>Jets <lb/>ccbar-&gt;ee+X <lb/>bbbar-&gt;ee+X <lb/>ttbar <lb/>W <lb/>/e)+X <lb/>π <lb/>/e)( <lb/>π <lb/>-&gt;( <lb/>τ <lb/>τ <lb/>Z-&gt; <lb/>total background <lb/>FIG. 3: Left panel: reconstructed single electron spectra in the central barrel.

The errors given are statistical. <lb/>We have presented a study of Z 0 reconstruction in pp collisions at 14 TeV with the central <lb/>barrel of the ALICE detector. The Z 0 →e + e − yields are of the order of 3×10 −8 per minimum-bias <lb/>pp collisions. A Level 1 TRD trigger (p T &gt;10 GeV/c) for 10 % of data taking time would lead to a <lb/>Z 0 sample of about 100 per year. Further enhancement is possible using the High-Level Trigger. <lb/>The decay electrons are identified with the TRD and the TPC detectors within the central barrel <lb/>(|η|&lt;0.9). The probability to misidentify a π ± has been extrapolated to the high momentum region <lb/>of interest and is of the order of 0.1 at 45 GeV/c. The two main characteristics of the electrons <lb/>emitted in Z 0 decays, i.e. high p T and isolation, have been used to reject the background. Two high <lb/>p T isolated reconstructed electrons constitute a very clear signature of the Z 0 in the central barrel. <lb/>The background is expected to be of the order of 1 % in pp collisions, dominated by misidentified <lb/>pions from jets. <lb/></body>
