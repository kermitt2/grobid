			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>The topographic organisation of the mammalian cortex <lb/>has long been a topic of research, with the presence of <lb/>orderly maps (or the lack thereof) in some cortical areas <lb/>being a key di↵erence between species. Examples of such <lb/>topographic organisation include tonotopy in the auditory <lb/>cortex, retinotopy in the visual cortex, and orientation <lb/>columns in the visual cortex of some mammals. Mouse <lb/>cortex has often been given as a typical example of a ran-<lb/>dom arrangement with its &quot;salt and pepper&quot; configuration. <lb/>The organization of mouse auditory cortex has however re-<lb/>cently been under debate, with two photon calcium imag-<lb/>ing studies showing heterogenous organisation in terms <lb/>of preferred frequency when considering spiking activity <lb/>from neighbouring neurons from upper layers, while show-<lb/>ing tonotopy when considering the aggregated activity of <lb/>groups of neurons (Rothschild et al., 2010; Bandyopad-<lb/>hyay et al., 2010). Recent electrophysiological studies have <lb/>shown that tonotopy largely depends on the type of signal <lb/>considered for the characterisation, quality of tuning in-<lb/>cluded, area of auditory cortex, anaesthetic state and layer <lb/>with upstream layers having a degraded tonotopy com-<lb/>pared to thalamo-cortical recipient layer (Hackett et al., <lb/>2011; Guo et al., 2012). <lb/>We can expect that any property exhibited by a pop-<lb/>ulation of neurons must have an underlying biophysical <lb/>correlate. It has been proposed that local connectivity <lb/>plays an important role in shaping the arrangement seen <lb/>in cortices lacking in orderly arrangement of columns as is <lb/>the case with mouse cortex, while the existence of struc-<lb/>ture such as pinwheels and the columnar arrangement <lb/>around them is mainly due to long range suppressive con-<lb/>nections (Kaschube et al., 2010). Experimental evidence <lb/>from in-vitro studies has shown mini columnar ensembles <lb/>(Maruoka et al., 2011; Krieger et al., 2007) not yet been <lb/>characterised in vivo, which in principle could aggregate <lb/>to form functional units as suggested by (Krieger et al., <lb/>2007) and (Ohki et al., 2005) and could constitute the ba-<lb/>sis of columnar processing by sharing common input and <lb/>being synaptically connected. <lb/>In this study, using high density columnar micro elec-<lb/>trode arrays, we measured functional properties of local <lb/>columnar populations from layer V. Reconciling the known <lb/>random configuration exhibited by mouse cortex and the <lb/>columnar processing expected to take place, we found that <lb/>groups of neighbouring neurons tend to share similar prop-<lb/>erties while still having a rich variety of response profiles, <lb/>coherent with the existence of overlapping fine-scale net-<lb/>works (Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005; Yoshimura et al., <lb/>2005). We studied monosynaptic interactions within these <lb/>local networks, finding highly non-random connectivity <lb/>and their spatial coverage supports the idea of inter col-<lb/>umn functional aggregation. <lb/>2.

Mice were deeply <lb/>anaesthetised with a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/Kg), <lb/>midazolam (5 mg/Kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/Kg). <lb/>The animal&apos;s temperature was maintained at 37 C using <lb/>a feedback controlled blanket. <lb/>A small craniotomy was performed over auditory cortex <lb/>area A1, and recordings with high density electrode arrays <lb/>were made using a Poly3-25s probe (Neuronexus Technolo-<lb/>gies) as shown in Fig. 1A. The probe was introduced paral-<lb/>lel to the midline and lowered to a single location targeting <lb/>layer 5, collecting both spontaneous and evoked activity. <lb/>We used iso-intensity pure tone stimuli (70 dB) gen-<lb/>erated using an RZ6 real-time processor and presented <lb/>via electrostatic speaker (ES-1; Tucker-Davis Technolo-<lb/>gies) placed 5 cm behind the contralateral ear. Pure tones <lb/>(3-48 kHz, 1/3 octave steps, 100 ms duration), gated with <lb/>ramped cosine windows (3 ms to 90% of maximum), were <lb/>presented at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. <lb/>2.2. Single unit characterisation <lb/>Single neurons were isolated and localised as described <lb/>previously (Delgado-Ruz and Schultz, 2014) from raw data <lb/>collected across the 32 channels as seen in Fig. 1B. Briefly, <lb/>signals were spike sorted using Caton/MaskedKlustakwik <lb/>(Kadir et al., 2014), and then each isolated neuron was <lb/>fitted to a line source model to estimate its location. Ex-<lb/>amples of sorted neurons can be seen in Fig. 1C and a <lb/>raster plot of all recorded neurons in Fig. 1D. Each neu-<lb/>ron was also classified as narrow spiking or broad spiking <lb/>(putative inhibitory and excitatory respectively) following <lb/>the procedure described in (Peyrache et al., 2012), which <lb/>is based on the temporal waveform of the action potential. <lb/>The tuning of each unit was calculated for the 40 ms <lb/>after stimulus onset. This time window was selected as <lb/>the responses measured when using larger time windows <lb/>contain more noise (Moshitch et al., 2006). In addition, <lb/>upstream neurons are likely to use the first few tens of <lb/>milliseconds from the neurons&apos;s responses (see Cohen and <lb/>Kohn (2011) for discussion). <lb/>The neuronal response to stimuli was characterised us-<lb/>ing three metrics: preferred frequency, bandwidth and <lb/>peak latency from onset. The bandwidth measures the <lb/>selectivity exhibited by each neuron, while the latency <lb/>reflects di↵erences on upstream path and distance from <lb/>soma to synaptic inputs (Carrasco and Lomber, 2009; Bi-<lb/>zley et al., 2005; Sakata and Harris, 2009; Katona et al., <lb/>2012). Preferred frequency was defined as the frequency <lb/>that elicited the largest evoked response. Bandwidth was <lb/>defined as the 3 dB bandwidth around the preferred fre-<lb/>quency, and peak latency from onset was defined as the <lb/>time elapsed from onset until the peak firing rate for the <lb/>preferred frequency. <lb/>Di↵erences in response properties were shown qualita-<lb/>tively using Voronoi diagrams. To construct them the xy <lb/>cartesian plane is divided into regions (one per neuron) <lb/>whose boundaries are defined based on neurons&apos; locations <lb/>calculating boundaries equidistant to neighbouring neu-<lb/>rons. By assigning to each region the property value mea-<lb/>sured for the neuron associated to it, the Voronoi diagrams <lb/>allow us to graphically show how the xy plane spans dif-<lb/>ferent property values. <lb/>The temporal response profile was characterised, iden-<lb/>tifying neurons that showed ON (transient or sustained <lb/>response) and OFF responses. This simple separation al-<lb/>lowed us to see the range of responses. We used the method <lb/>described in detail in (Willott et al., 1988), which is based <lb/>on the computation of an adaptation ratio A r that quanti-<lb/>fies variations in firing rate on the time slots after stimulus <lb/>onset. Neurons with A r &lt; 0.2 were considered as having a <lb/>transient or phasic response, while 0.2 &lt; A r &lt; 2 were con-<lb/>sidered sustained. Neurons having a firing rate above 25% <lb/>above spontaneous level after stimulus o↵set were consid-<lb/>ered to have an OFF response. <lb/>2.3. Characterisation of interactions <lb/>Each recorded pair was analysed to detect putative <lb/>monosynaptic connections (Fujisawa et al., 2008), with <lb/>crosscorrelograms generated as described by Kohn and <lb/>Smith (2005). Pairwise signal correlation allows the mea-<lb/>surement of similarity between the response to stimuli; we <lb/>calculated it, according to standard usage, as the Pearson <lb/>correlation coe cient between mean responses to stimuli: <lb/>r signal = <lb/>E [N 1 N 2 ] E [N 1 ] E [N 2 ] <lb/>N1 N2 <lb/>. <lb/>(1) <lb/>Here E is the expected value and <lb/>the standard devi-<lb/>ation of the mean spike count N i . Noise correlation or <lb/>spike count correlation measures the tendency of neurons <lb/>to covary their firing rate, and is calculated as the Pearson <lb/>correlation coe cient between variations around the mean <lb/>responses to stimuli (Bair et al., 2001; Kohn and Smith, <lb/>2005): <lb/>r sc = <lb/>E [ N 1 N 2 ] E [ N 1 ] E [ N 2 ] <lb/>N1 <lb/>N2 <lb/>(2) <lb/>where N i corresponds to the di↵erence between the mean <lb/>response of cell i to a particular stimulus and its response <lb/>on a particular trial. Signal correlation may reflect shared <lb/>inputs driven by the stimuli, whereas noise correlation may <lb/>reflect slower network oscillations and synchronous activ-<lb/>ity not linked to stimuli (Cohen and Kohn, 2011). The <lb/>All-Way Shu✏e Predictor and Jitter Corrector were used <lb/>to correct the crosscorrelograms (Kohn and Smith, 2005; <lb/>Smith and Kohn, 2008). The shu✏e predictor allows the <lb/>removal of correlations locked to the stimulus, while the <lb/>jitter corrector removes correlations arising from slow os-<lb/>cillations and stimulus-locked correlations. The All-Way <lb/>Shu✏e Predictor (Kohn and Smith, 2005) corresponds to <lb/>the CCG calculated after shu✏ing the id of the di↵erent <lb/></body>

The Jitter <lb/>Corrector, see (Smith and Kohn, 2008) for details, corre-<lb/>sponds to the CCG calculated over surrogate spike trains. <lb/>The method for generating the surrogates can be sum-<lb/>marised as follows: <lb/>• A window for jittering T j ms is defined. <lb/>• Each spike train for each trial is divided in time win-<lb/>dows of length T j . The timestamps of all spikes across <lb/>trials within each time window are added to a pool of <lb/>spikes. <lb/>• On each trial, for each time window, the spikes are <lb/>replaced for a spike randomly chosen from the corre-<lb/>sponding pool of spikes. <lb/>CCG jittered (⌧ ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>M <lb/>M <lb/>P <lb/>i=1 <lb/>N <lb/>P <lb/>t=1 <lb/>x i <lb/>jitt 1 (t) • x i <lb/>jitt 2 (t + ⌧ ) <lb/>⇥(⌧ ) <lb/>p <lb/>1 2 <lb/>(4) <lb/>The timescales of correlations, r ccg (Kohn and Smith, <lb/>2005; Bair et al., 2001), were characterised to study di↵er-<lb/>ence in noise correlations found between this and previous <lb/>studies, as this metric allows to study the correlations over <lb/>varying time windows with lower variance when timescales <lb/>of correlations are shorter than the trial. Defined as the <lb/>integral of the CCG over the integration time window, nor-<lb/>malised by the geometric mean of the integral of the ACGs <lb/>over the same period: <lb/>r ccg (t) = <lb/>t <lb/>P <lb/>⌧ = t <lb/>CCG(⌧ ) <lb/>s <lb/>t <lb/>P <lb/>⌧ = t <lb/>ACG 1 (⌧ ) • <lb/>t <lb/>P <lb/>⌧ = t <lb/>ACG 2 (⌧ ) <lb/>(5) <lb/>CCG and ACGs were corrected by the shu✏e predictor. It <lb/>can be shown that when considering the same time window <lb/>r ccg is equivalent to spike count correlation (Bair et al., <lb/>2001). <lb/>Synchrony measures the tendency of neurons to fire with <lb/>short and consistent delay between them. It was charac-<lb/>terised using A ccg (Smith and Kohn, 2008): the area un-<lb/>der the jitter-corrected CCG (slow oscillations and stimu-<lb/>lus locked variations are removed before integrating), with <lb/>a 50 ms jitter window. The integration was performed <lb/>between [-10,10] ms, in order to measure tightly coupled <lb/>activity between pairs of neurons while removing loosely <lb/>coordinated activity: <lb/>A ccg = <lb/>10 <lb/>X <lb/>⌧ = 10 <lb/>[CCG(⌧ ) CCG jitter (⌧ )] <lb/>(6) <lb/>A ccg allowed us to measure synchrony between pairs of <lb/>neurons, which could be due to common synaptic inputs <lb/>or synaptic connections. The correlation between synapti-<lb/>cally connected pairs and synchrony was therefore studied. <lb/>Information carried by neurons about the stimulus was <lb/>calculated using the software provided by Ince et al. <lb/>(2009). We computed I sh and used the NSB estimator <lb/>(Nemenman et al., 2001) to compensate for sampling bias <lb/>(the bias due to the limited number of trials available un-<lb/>der experimental conditions). Information carried by sin-<lb/>gle units was calculated using a variable time window to <lb/>evaluate the e↵ect of timing on the information conveyed <lb/>by the evoked response. On each trial the neuron&apos;s re-<lb/>sponse corresponded to a vector with the number of spikes <lb/>fired on each time bin. The binning ranged from 40 ms (full <lb/>time window, equivalent to spike count analysis) to 5 ms <lb/>(at which the information carried by single units started <lb/>to saturate). Information analysis for triplets and pairs <lb/>of neurons was done with a time window of 40 ms (spike <lb/>count) and 10 ms (a time window that allowed a reduced <lb/>number of possible response symbols, yet keeping temporal <lb/>information). To reduce the number of possible responses <lb/>spike counts were thresholded at the 95th percentile for <lb/>40 ms time windows and only allowed to be 0/1 for 10 ms <lb/>time windows. Response of pairs and triplets was simply <lb/>the concatenated vector response of the individual neu-<lb/>rons. Information gain for pairs and triplets was calculated <lb/>on each case by subtracting the information obtained from <lb/>the joint response minus the sum of information obtained <lb/>by individual responses. <lb/>2.4. Local field potential characterisation <lb/>LFP conveys information about synaptic currents <lb/>(Buzsáki et al., 2012) and its tuning can be then compared <lb/>to tuning seen on the local neuronal population. We in-<lb/>cluded the 4-40 Hz frequency range which has been shown <lb/>to convey tuning information (Eggermont et al., 2011). <lb/>LFP baseline was calculated over the time window minus <lb/>12 to 0 ms relative to stimulus onset. The baseline LFP <lb/>was then integrated over the 0 to 40 ms time window to <lb/>obtain the evoked LFP for each frequency. The best fre-<lb/>quency for the LFP was defined as that with the largest <lb/>integrated value. LFP latency was measured at this fre-<lb/>quency from onset to peak response. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. The local columnar population presents similar re-<lb/>sponse properties, but large di↵erences are possible <lb/>We recorded from 231 neurons from 12 mice. Of these, <lb/>82 neurons demonstrated frequency tuning. Our find-<lb/>ings (values reported as mean ± s.e.m unless otherwise <lb/>stated) are in agreement with previous reports (Rothschild <lb/>et al., 2010; Hromádka et al., 2008) of sparse responses in <lb/>anaesthetised mouse auditory cortex. Recorded neurons <lb/></body>

			<body>were classified as narrow spiking (24.7 %) or broad spik-<lb/>ing (75.3 %). Mean spontaneous firing rate was 1.1 ± <lb/>0.21 spikes/sec, while mean evoked firing rate was 2.7 <lb/>± 0.47 spikes/sec. 90% of the cells had evoked firing <lb/>rate below 7.1 spikes/sec. These low firing rates are in <lb/>agreement with previous reports (Hromádka et al., 2008; <lb/>Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; DeWeese et al., 2003). We <lb/>found the mean preferred frequency across neurons to be <lb/>16.7 ± 1.4 kHz, mean latency to be 26.8 ± 0.94 ms, <lb/>mean LFP latency 27.1 ± 1.1 ms and mean bandwidth <lb/>6.3 ± 0.64 kHz. These values are in accordance with <lb/>previous reports showing a non-homogeneous representa-<lb/>tion of frequencies in primary auditory cortex, with a peak <lb/>at around 22 kHz (Rothschild et al., 2010), and the mean <lb/>delay in layer five measured to be around 21 ms by Sakata <lb/>and Harris (2009). <lb/>In Fig. 2 we show data from two representative popula-<lb/>tion recordings. In the first column we see the estimated <lb/>location of each neuron on the xy plane relative to the <lb/>probe, and colour coded their preferred frequency. We can <lb/>appreciate that in general they tend to prefer nearby fre-<lb/>quencies. Qualitatively we can see from the tuning curves <lb/>shown on the second column that having similar preferred <lb/>frequency, their particular profile across frequencies can <lb/>still di↵er greatly. From the third column, showing raster <lb/>plots of their evoked responses across trials, we can see that <lb/>their temporal response profile can also be very dissimilar <lb/>and within each recording we found a variety of temporal <lb/>response profiles. These di↵erences on their temporal pro-<lb/>file are an indication of the di↵erent processing done by <lb/>each neuron and their temporal profile likely determines <lb/>temporal windows relevant for downstream neurons. <lb/>We found that in deep layers of primary auditory cortex, <lb/>neurons tend to share similar response properties. When <lb/>comparing simultaneously recorded neurons, the mean dif-<lb/>ference in properties exhibited by simultaneously recorded <lb/>neurons was small compared to the full range spanned <lb/>by the responses, as seen in table 1 (each column list-<lb/>ing mean, s.e.m, 95th percentile and maximum di↵erence <lb/>respectively). A fractured representation was present in <lb/>some recordings, as can be seen from the Voronoi diagrams <lb/>in Fig. 3A where we can appreciate smoothness which is <lb/>fractured by sudden changes. While the tendency was for <lb/>neurons to present similar preferred frequency as the LFP <lb/>(Fig. 3B) and for pairs of neurons to share similar response <lb/>properties, some pairs displayed quite dissimilar proper-<lb/>ties (lying at the opposite ends of the spectrum), as can <lb/>be seen in the histograms of Fig. 3C and last column of <lb/>table 1 which lists the maximum di↵erence measured be-<lb/>tween pairs of neurons. <lb/>metric <lb/>mean s.e.m 95th percentile max <lb/>di↵erence preferred frequency KHz <lb/>8.1 <lb/>0.62 <lb/>32.9 <lb/>43.2 <lb/>di↵erence bandwidth KHz <lb/>5.1 <lb/>0.33 <lb/>17.0 <lb/>31.4 <lb/>di↵erence latency ms <lb/>7.5 <lb/>0.39 <lb/>19.0 <lb/>27.0 <lb/>preferred frequency to LFP KHz <lb/>10.9 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>43.2 <lb/>43.2 <lb/>Table 1: Di↵erences in response properties between <lb/>simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons <lb/>Di↵erence seen in preferred frequency, bandwidth, delay and <lb/>best frequency to LFP. <lb/>metric <lb/>under 100 um above 150 um <lb/>di↵erence preferred frequency KHz <lb/>8.6 ±0.87 <lb/>5.2 ±0.89 <lb/>di↵erence bandwidth KHz <lb/>5.2 ±0.44 <lb/>5.4 ±0.78 <lb/>di↵erence latency ms <lb/>7.0 ±0.48 <lb/>7.8 ±0.92 <lb/>Table 2: Changes in di↵erence of response properties over <lb/>distance <lb/>We compare for all response properties (preferred frequency, <lb/>bandwidth, latency) the mean±sem for neurons located close <lb/>(under 100 µm appart) and far (over 150 µm away). Di↵erences <lb/>were not statistically significant <lb/>The similarity in terms of stimulus preference was quan-<lb/>tified by the signal correlation, which was high on average <lb/>(0.58 ±0.023 ), however this large signal correlation does <lb/>not reflect di↵erences on the temporal profiles of the cells <lb/>seen on the raster plots in Fig. 2 which might indicate that <lb/>a more complex stimuli would yield a lower signal corre-<lb/>lation. A relatively large proportion of pairs of neurons <lb/>exhibited quite similar response properties at all separa-<lb/>tions up to several hundred microns apart, as indicated by <lb/>the large fraction of neurons at all separations with signal <lb/>correlation approaching 1.0 in Fig. 4A. Nevertheless, there <lb/>was also a significant tail of neurons showing quite dissim-<lb/>ilar tuning (neurons with signal correlation close to zero <lb/>in Fig. 4A). There was no significant linear correlation be-<lb/>tween signal correlation and distance (Pearson r = -0.024 <lb/>), with pairs spanning the full range of signal correlation <lb/>at all distances. <lb/>There was no significant dependence of di↵erence in re-<lb/>sponse properties and distance between cells, as shown in <lb/>Fig. 4B-D. When comparing the mean for neurons located <lb/>closer than 100 µm apart versus neurons more than 150 <lb/>µm apart from each other, as listed in table 2, we found <lb/>that: for di↵erences in preferred frequency, although ap-<lb/>parently decreasing with distance, the change was not sta-<lb/>tistically significant(Mann-Whitney U-test); di↵erences in <lb/>bandwidth did not show change with distance; di↵erences <lb/>in latency, although apparently increasing on average with <lb/>distance, this change was not statistically significant. <lb/>3.2. Correlation and synchrony decay with distance and <lb/>during evoked activity <lb/>Noise correlation measures the tendency of the trial to <lb/>trial fluctuations of neuronal responses to the same stim-<lb/>ulus to correlate with each other. This can be due to <lb/></body>

			<body>slow oscillations (such as the changes seen during up and <lb/>down states) or faster synchronous activity generated by <lb/>shared inputs unrelated to the stimulus. We measured the <lb/>noise correlation between pairs of neurons over the 40 ms <lb/>time window used above to compute the signal correlation. <lb/>Noise was positively correlated with signal correlation as <lb/>seen in Fig. 5A, meaning that neurons that share more <lb/>stimuli related inputs also share more substrate inputs. <lb/>Noise correlation was not heavily dependent on distance as <lb/>seen in Fig. 5B, but larger values only occurred at shorter <lb/>distances. The 95th percentile could be bound by an ex-<lb/>ponential of decay constant 169.7 µm, which implies that <lb/>over this distance the largest values of noise correlation are <lb/>reduced on approximately 60%. <lb/>Our population average noise correlation of 0.057 ± <lb/>0.0051 is in agreement with Sakata and Harris (2009), <lb/>but is 4 times smaller than that reported by Rothschild <lb/>et al. (2010). This could be attributed to the time win-<lb/>dow used to compute noise correlation, since as seen in <lb/>Fig. 5C our correlation saturates at similar mean values <lb/>seen in (Rothschild et al., 2010) when increasing the time <lb/>window to match the 200 ms used in that study. However, <lb/>large windows are unlikely to be relevant when consider-<lb/>ing processing of information done by downstream neurons <lb/>(Cohen and Kohn, 2011). <lb/>The noise correlation r ccg observed during spontaneous <lb/>activity was greater than that observed during evoked ac-<lb/>tivity (as seen in Fig. 5D for varying integration windows <lb/>from 0 to 200 ms). Mean r ccg of 0.13 ± 0.0063 for spon-<lb/>taneous, compared to 0.097 ± 0.0050 for evoked at T = <lb/>40 ms which corresponds to the time window used to char-<lb/>acterize tuning and signal correlation; p=0.00014 at 5% <lb/>significance, n=263.0 pairs of tunned neurons, Wilcoxon <lb/>rank sum test). We interpret this as de-correlation of the <lb/>local population during sensory stimulation. <lb/>To study changes in synchrony (correlation at very short <lb/>timescales), we measured the area under the crosscorrel-<lb/>ogram A ccg . We observed a greater synchrony in sponta-<lb/>neous as compared to evoked activity: 0.029 ± 0.00048 <lb/>and 0.024 ± 0.00033 coincidences per spike respectively. <lb/>This is reminiscent of similar results observed in primate <lb/>visual cortex (Kohn and Smith, 2005). Synchrony during <lb/>evoked activity was 42.6 % (best fitting line) of the levels of <lb/>synchrony measured during spontaneous, this compares to <lb/>70.1 % seen in correlation, the comparison of spontaneous <lb/>versus evoked can be seen qualitatively in Fig. 5D and E. <lb/>This means that the loss of synchrony was more significant <lb/>that changes at slower timescales. Therefore we can con-<lb/>clude that di↵erent network configurations are active dur-<lb/>ing evoked and spontaneous activity, driving neurons on <lb/>the local population to di↵erent correlation and synchrony <lb/>regimes, this particular stimulus did not change signifi-<lb/>cantly slower oscillations but had a significant impact on <lb/>synchrony. In terms of its dependance on distance, the <lb/>largest recorded values of synchrony decayed faster during <lb/>evoked activity than during spontaneous, as can be seen <lb/>from Fig. 5F where a exponential was fitted to the 95th <lb/>percentile with decay constants of 317.1 and 446.8 µm <lb/>for evoked and spontaneous activity respectively, which <lb/>could imply overlaping network configurations that dif-<lb/>fer on their physical coverage being more confined during <lb/>evoked activity. <lb/>3.3. Groups of neurons carry redundant information on <lb/>average, but high information gains are achieved on <lb/>similarly tuned pairs <lb/>We calculated the information carried by single units, <lb/>pairs and triplets of neurons. Single unit analysis was done <lb/>over varying size of binning time window, starting from 40 <lb/>ms (equivalent to evaluating the information carried by <lb/>spike count) we decreased the time window to see the im-<lb/>pact of timing on the information carried by each neuron. <lb/>From Fig. 6A we see that information started to saturate <lb/>at 5 ms when the average information carried per neuron <lb/>was 4.5 ±0.48 bits/sec and the average information car-<lb/>ried by a single spike was of 0.96 ±0.073 bits (Fig. 6B). <lb/>The distribution of information carried by single spikes was <lb/>not homogenous as seen in Fig. 6C, the distribution was <lb/>skewed and only a tail of neurons carried a large amount <lb/>of information per spike. There was no di↵erence between <lb/>broad spiking and narrow spiking neurons (mean: 0.95 <lb/>±0.079 bits/spike versus 0.98 ±0.15 bits/spike, p=0.80 , <lb/>Mann-Whitney U-test) <lb/>We then measured the information gain obtained when <lb/>considering the response of ensembles formed by pairs and <lb/>triplets of neurons. The gain corresponds to the di↵er-<lb/>ence between the information obtained from the ensemble <lb/>minus the sum of informations obtained when considering <lb/>each neuron individually. This is identical to the percent-<lb/>age synergy measure used in some previous studies (e.g. <lb/>Panzeri et al. (1999); Montani et al. (2007)). We studied <lb/>information using a 40 ms time window (information car-<lb/>ried by spike count) and 10 ms time window (a shorter <lb/>time window produces a response space too large in order <lb/>to estimate probabilities), by comparing both cases we can <lb/>study how sensitive to timing is the information carried by <lb/>the ensembles. <lb/>In Fig. 6D, we show the information carried by pairs ver-<lb/>sus information carried independently by the constituent <lb/>neurons. Comparing the 40 ms binning (left) with the 10 <lb/>ms binning (middle) we can appreciate that more pairs of <lb/>neurons deviate from a full independent regime (diagonal) <lb/>when timing is included on the vector response. This can <lb/>be also seen from the information gain histograms (right <lb/>panel) where we see that the spread of the fitted gaussian <lb/>(red line) is larger for the 10 ms window (continuous line) <lb/>and there is also an increase in the number of pairs with <lb/>high information gain. While the maximum absolute in-<lb/>formation gain with a 40 ms window was 4.4 bps, the <lb/>maximum gain with a 10 ms window was of 4.9 bps. In <lb/>the mean time, the maximum relative gain for each time <lb/>window was of 62.6 % and 231.3 % respectively. 3.8 % <lb/>of the pairs had an information gain over 50% when us-<lb/>ing a 10 ms window, these pairs had on average a signal <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>correlation of 0.76 ±0.066 , higher than the average for <lb/>all pairs (Mann-Whitney U-test, pval=0.048 , 5% signifi-<lb/>cance). These results tell us that while spike count does <lb/>not have a large impact on information gain, when consid-<lb/>ering timing on the responses there is a gain for ensembles <lb/>of neurons which have a high signal correlation corrobo-<lb/>rating the richness of the responses across the population <lb/>despite their tuning similarity. On average however pairs <lb/>of neurons carried redundant information as seen from the <lb/>negative mean on the information gain histograms. <lb/>From Fig. 6E we see that a similar picture can be ex-<lb/>tracted for triplets of neurons. The relative information <lb/>gain when using a 40 ms window was smaller than when <lb/>using a 10 ms window (10.6 versus 5.5 bps of absolute <lb/>gain and 43.3 versus 138.3 % of relative gain). Therefore, <lb/>maximum relative gain for triplets was smaller than for <lb/>pairs and the percentage of triplets with information gain <lb/>above 50% was much lower than for pairs: 0.54 %. Also <lb/>the percentage of triplets that showed synergy (gain of in-<lb/>formation) was smaller than the percentage of synergistic <lb/>pairs (24.8 versus 39.8 %). <lb/>3.4. Local connectivity is highly non-random <lb/>The role that neurons play within microcircuits is de-<lb/>termined both by their intrinsic properties and by feeding <lb/>connections or interactions with other neurons. Previous <lb/>studies have highlighted the importance of local connec-<lb/>tivity, since it is expected that responses to stimuli are <lb/>shaped by sensory related input (feedforward from thala-<lb/>mus in the input layers and upper layers in the case of layer <lb/>V) and local interactions which in general have been as-<lb/>sumed to further shape functional response. We therefore <lb/>characterised connectivity for local populations of layer V <lb/>neurons, in order to elucidate the role that these connec-<lb/>tions play. <lb/>Putative monosynaptic connections were detected based <lb/>on crosscorrelograms. From our population of 231 neurons <lb/>we found 21 to be exciting other neurons, with 20 of them <lb/>corresponding to broad spiking neurons (putative excita-<lb/>tory neurons) and one possibly being excitatory with nar-<lb/>row spike waveform. The excited neurons (18) included <lb/>both broad and narrow spiking (putative inhibitory) neu-<lb/>rons: 10 and 8 neurons respectively. Considering that only <lb/>nearly 20% of recorded cells are inhibitory (Meinecke and <lb/>Peters, 1987; Xu et al., 2010), our results are consistent <lb/>with a previous report that showed that probability of <lb/>connection was higher on inhibitory neurons compared to <lb/>excitatory, Yoshimura and Callaway (2005). This classifi-<lb/>cation can be seen graphically in Fig. 7A left, were we can <lb/>appreciate the correspondence between the excitatory and <lb/>broad spiking class. In Fig. 7A right panel we can see that <lb/>most of the neurons exciting others had a short refractory <lb/>period and high burst index, which might suggest that <lb/>they are large pyramidal cells from layer V, whose firing <lb/>pattern matches that previously described by Christophe <lb/>et al. (2005). Large pyramidal cells of layer V are known <lb/>to be highly interconnected (Thomson and Lamy, 2007), <lb/>in agreement with our observations. <lb/>In our dataset we found a low probability of connec-<lb/>tion: 0.0074 , which matches low connection probabili-<lb/>ties reported elsewhere (Song et al., 2005; Bartho et al., <lb/>2004). Despite this low probability, motifs of highly in-<lb/>terconnected neurons were common, triplets of connected <lb/>neurons occurred in 7 of the 10 recordings where synaptic <lb/>connections were detected despite their low probability of <lb/>occurrence: 0.00005 . This result agrees with a previous <lb/>in-vitro connectivity characterisation of layer V pyramidal <lb/>neurons (Song et al., 2005), and is suggestive of highly non-<lb/>random connectivity, with neurons forming sub-networks <lb/>instead of loose pairs of synaptically connected neurons. <lb/>The mean signal correlation between synaptically con-<lb/>nected pairs was higher than the average signal correlation, <lb/>but the di↵erence was not statistically significant (Mann-<lb/>Whitney U-test): 0.73 ± 0.081 versus 0.58 ± 0.023 , re-<lb/>spectively. The mean noise correlation was higher (pval= <lb/>0.024 , Mann-Whitney U-test) on average between con-<lb/>nected pairs than the mean among all pairs: 0.14 ± 0.041 <lb/>versus 0.057 ± 0.0051 (see Fig. 7D). A more complex <lb/>stimulus might enhance di↵erences on signal correlation <lb/>while mantaining levels of noise correlation. <lb/>Synaptically connected pairs of neurons were on aver-<lb/>age synergistic when using a 10 ms binning window for <lb/>the response vector (i.e. including timing e↵ects), having <lb/>on average 18.9 ±12.4 percent of information gain. The <lb/>maximum gain among these pairs was of 86.0 % and only <lb/>2 pairs carried redundant information (negative informa-<lb/>tion gain). In Fig. 7C we show an example of a triplet <lb/>formed by a pair carrying redundant information (-18.2 % <lb/>information gain, bottom row) and the other being slightly <lb/>synergistic (3.5 % gain, top row), seeing the response pat-<lb/>tern on these neurons across trials it would be interesting <lb/>to explore the functional role these kind of synaptic con-<lb/>nections play. <lb/>The mean separation along the rostro-caudal (X) axis <lb/>between synaptically connected neurons was 28.3 µm, <lb/>while the mean vertical (Y) separation was 48.9 µm. The <lb/>mean total distance was of 61.0 µm. 90 % of detected <lb/>pairs were located at less than 44.1 , 99.1 and 105.8 µm <lb/>along the X, Y axis and total distance. These measure-<lb/>ments are in agreement with Song et al. (2005), where the <lb/>authors report for pyramidal neurons of layer V that 82% <lb/>of the connections are located less than 50 µm apart, with <lb/>the remaining 18 % being separated by less than 110 µm. <lb/>Our findings also agree with a connectivity study (Levy <lb/>and Reyes, 2012), of layer 4 of auditory cortex reporting <lb/>that the probability of connection is well fitted by a gaus-<lb/>sian with a spread of 85-114 µm, implying that the prob-<lb/>ability of synaptic connections decays as we move away in <lb/>the coronal plane. Minicolumns have been proposed as a <lb/>functional unit, with several mini columns interacting and <lb/>being synaptically connected (Krieger et al., 2007), on that <lb/>study synaptic connections were equally probable between <lb/>neurons on the same bundle versus neurons belonging to <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>neighbouring bundles. In contrast in our dataset we found <lb/>that most of the connections, 87.5 %, were between neu-<lb/>rons located over 10 µm appart along the horizontal axis <lb/>(rostro caudal) with 41.7 % of connections being between <lb/>pairs located between 30 and 40 µm. Although the colum-<lb/>nar distribution in our dataset was not determined, given <lb/>the columnar distribution of the electrodes themselves, we <lb/>would argue that our findings are in agreement with the <lb/>multi minicolumn interaction theory. <lb/>We measured how synchrony changed on spontaneous <lb/>versus evoked activity. In the previous section we showed <lb/>that for the whole population synchrony during evoked <lb/>activity was a 42.6 % of that seen during spontaneous. <lb/>For synaptically connected pairs we found this to be 62.6 <lb/>%. This means that even for monosynaptically connected <lb/>pairs, synchrony decreases when going from spontaneous <lb/>to evoked activity, although the decrement is smaller than <lb/>for the general population of neurons. Changes in synaptic <lb/>strength have been reported previously (Fujisawa et al., <lb/>2008) and could imply di↵erent subnetworks operating on <lb/>a local columnar population. <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>Recent studies (Rothschild et al., 2010; Bandyopadhyay <lb/>et al., 2010; Hackett et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012) have <lb/>examined the response properties of the superficial lay-<lb/>ers of A1. They have reported tonotopy when recording <lb/>multi unit activity and LFP, but fractured tonotopy at the <lb/>single neuron scale, with neighbouring neurons exhibiting <lb/>very di↵erent frequency preferences. Tonotopy has been <lb/>reported to be stronger in the thalamo-cortical recipient <lb/>layer, and degraded in downstream layers. In this study <lb/>we examined tonotopic structure in local neuronal popu-<lb/>lations in the main output layer of A1 (layer 5) with the <lb/>aim of characterizing their response properties. <lb/>Our study, the first use of dense columnar recording <lb/>technology to map tonotopy in mouse auditory cortex, <lb/>revealed fractured tonotopy at the level of single neu-<lb/>rons: neighbouring neurons tend to share frequency pref-<lb/>erences, but with occasional large di↵erences in tuning. <lb/>Previous multi-electrode array electrophysiological studies <lb/>have shown tonotopy at a scale of hundreds of microns <lb/>(e.g. (Guo et al., 2012) which used a sparse array and <lb/>(Hackett et al., 2011) which used a high density linear <lb/>array shifted in position over hundreds of µm), but due <lb/>to relatively sparse spatial sampling, these studies were <lb/>unable to provide evidence of the detailed topographic or-<lb/>ganisation of auditory cortex on small volumes (From our <lb/>estimated locations, the maximum scanned volume was <lb/>of 0.0015 mm 3 , spanning 84.2 µm rostro-caudal, 277.2 <lb/>µm vertical and 64.2 µm lateral). Several recent stud-<lb/>ies, using two photon calcium imaging, found a high de-<lb/>gree of heterogeneity in the tuning of spiking-related cal-<lb/>cium signals at the single neuron scale (Rothschild et al., <lb/>2010; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010). One possible reason <lb/>for the di↵erence between our finding and these studies <lb/>may be that they are e↵ectively sampling from a single <lb/>coronal plane covering layers II/III, whereas we densely <lb/>sampled in the columnar axis targeting only layer V. The <lb/>groups of similarly tuned neurons we observed could have a <lb/>physical correlate, for example micro columns or bundles <lb/>(Maruoka et al., 2011; Krieger et al., 2007; Ohki et al., <lb/>2005), while being compatible with neighbouring groups <lb/>exhibiting large di↵erences in their preferred frequency as <lb/>found by our study and the aforementioned imaging stud-<lb/>ies. The incidence of large di↵erences in preferred fre-<lb/>quency might be related to the angle of insertion, with <lb/>slightly tilted angles increasing the probability of finding <lb/>large di↵erences between neighbouring neurons. <lb/>The specific pattern across frequencies varied substan-<lb/>tially between neighbouring neurons, despite their ten-<lb/>dency to operate on the same frequency band, we found <lb/>a large variability within the local population. On av-<lb/>erage simultaneously recorded neurons exhibited similar <lb/>preferred frequency and bandwidth, but large di↵erences <lb/>were possible at all separations between cells. This is <lb/>also seen from the large variability in signal correlation <lb/>found in the local population at all distances, with a higher <lb/>mean signal correlation than found in the previous stud-<lb/>ies which made use of two photon microscopy (Rothschild <lb/>et al., 2010; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010). This di↵er-<lb/>ence in mean signal correlation could be explained by the <lb/>columnar sampling of the population targeted by us as <lb/>opposed to the spanning of larger surfaces in the coronal <lb/>plane: in the former case, a larger amount of common in-<lb/>put might be expected. The use of iso-intensity tones also <lb/>increases the signal correlation since di↵erences in inten-<lb/>sity tuning are not considered. Despite the simplicity of <lb/>the stimuli used, we can conclude that local populations <lb/>in layer V constitute a set of complex and diverse filters. <lb/>Further studies with complex stimuli might help elucidate <lb/>how di↵erent spectrotemporal filters coexisting in the local <lb/>columnar population complement each other. <lb/>The temporal response patterns seen on local popula-<lb/>tions were also diverse, despite their tendency to have <lb/>similar peak latency from onset, with nearby neurons ex-<lb/>hibiting di↵erent temporal profiles (for example on/o↵ re-<lb/>sponse, sustained, transient). This again tells us about <lb/>the richness of response properties among the local popu-<lb/>lation, with neighbouring neurons potentially performing <lb/>very di↵erent processing tasks. The temporal profile de-<lb/>termines the time windows and temporal dynamics with <lb/>which neurons convey information about the stimuli, and <lb/>is defined by both the neuron&apos;s intrinsic properties, and <lb/>those of upstream feeding neurons. <lb/>Noise correlation was congruent with previous reported <lb/>values when analysing over similar time window. Noise <lb/>correlation was found to decrease during evoked activity, <lb/>therefore the stimulus used e↵ectively decorrelated the ac-<lb/>tivity of the local population. Synchrony was also found to <lb/>decrease during evoked activity, which indicates that even <lb/>neurons having a tighter connectivity see a change on their <lb/>connectivity strenght when stimulated. Average levels of <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>noise correlation and synchrony didn&apos;t show a dependance <lb/>with distance. However, the largest recorded values de-<lb/>cayed with distance in both cases, noise correlation de-<lb/>cayed faster than synchrony which in turn decayed faster <lb/>during evoked activity compared to spontaneous. This in-<lb/>dicates that networks directly involved on the transmision <lb/>of evoked activity are more localized than networks sus-<lb/>taining spontaneous activity. The superposition of com-<lb/>mon inputs driving the local population (providing sub <lb/>threshold oscillations, for example) and non random local <lb/>connectivity with the presence of hubs of connected neu-<lb/>rons, as seen in our recordings, would explain the faster <lb/>decay with distance of noise correlation compared to syn-<lb/>chrony. In support of this Yoshimura and Callaway (2005) <lb/>showed that synaptically connected neurons do not always <lb/>share common excitatory inputs, a fact which can be ex-<lb/>plained by complex fine-scale networks at a sub-columnar <lb/>scale (Yoshimura et al., 2005; Yoshimura and Callaway, <lb/>2005). There could be overlapping subnetworks which <lb/>might be activated under di↵erent stimuli conditions (Fu-<lb/>jisawa et al., 2008) as hinted by the reduction in synchrony <lb/>seen between synaptically connected neurons when switch-<lb/>ing from spontaneous to evoked. <lb/>When analysing the information carried by single neu-<lb/>rons we found that the rate of transmision and the in-<lb/>formation carried by each spike grew as we decreased the <lb/>binning window, which means that the code used by neu-<lb/>rons in mouse A1 to transmit information has a resolution <lb/>below 5 ms, or conversely, downstream neurons could po-<lb/>tentially decode responses at at least this time scale. A <lb/>more complex stimulus might yield an even higher gain as <lb/>the window is reduced, as shown in (Liu and Schreiner, <lb/>2007) for information carried by primary auditory cortex <lb/>neurons of mothers when stimulated with pup&apos;s crying <lb/>sounds. The distribution of information carried by sin-<lb/>gle spikes was not uniform but skewed in agreement with <lb/>previous observations from macaque auditory cortex (Ince <lb/>et al., 2013). <lb/>Pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons were found to <lb/>carry redundant information on average, but large gains <lb/>(synergy) were observed for pairs of neurons when tempo-<lb/>ral information was included on the response vector, these <lb/>levels of synergy were not seen when considering only spike <lb/>counts. We found that the mean signal correlation among <lb/>pairs which had a large synergy (above 50% information <lb/>gain) was higher than the average signal correlation, which <lb/>means that even when pairs showed similar response to <lb/>the stimulus they still carried complementary information <lb/>on the temporal profile of their responses. Also pairs of <lb/>monosynaptically connected neurons were on average syn-<lb/>ergistic, which implies that despite their common activ-<lb/>ity due to direct connectivity they can still carry comple-<lb/>mentary information. However we found few examples of <lb/>synaptic pairs operating in redundant mode and looking <lb/>at their response it would be worth investigating their role, <lb/>specially given their location on the main output layer of <lb/>cortex. <lb/>Triplets of neurons showed a similar result, by having <lb/>large synergy when temporal information was included on <lb/>the response vector. However, the largest gain seen on <lb/>triplets was lower than that measured for pairs and the <lb/>percentage of triplets with large gains was smaller than <lb/>the percentage of pairs. The percentage of triplets operat-<lb/>ing on synergistic mode was smaller than the percentage of <lb/>synergistic pairs, this results concords with findings from <lb/>rat motor cortex (Narayanan et al., 2005) which found <lb/>around 20% of pairs to be synergistic, while 99% of larger <lb/>groups (8 neurons) were redundant. We could expect to <lb/>find more synergy and less redundancy when using a more <lb/>complex stimulus, since a simple stimulus can increase the <lb/>level of redundancy by unexploiting the encoding capacity <lb/>of the neurons. Low levels of redundancy are also expected <lb/>according to a study from cat auditory cortex (Chechik <lb/>et al., 2006) which reported that redundancy decreases as <lb/>we move along the auditory pathway. The analysis per-<lb/>formed for groups of neurons rely on the assumptions done <lb/>about the decoding scheme used by downstream neurons, <lb/>such as not pooling spikes coming from di↵erent neurons, <lb/>which might not be the case if the feeding neurons synapse <lb/>on equivalent locations (see (Schultz et al., 2009) for a dis-<lb/>cussion of this issue in a quite di↵erent circuit, that of <lb/>the cerebellum). Synergy can be increased by pooling if <lb/>there is signal anticorrelation (Panzeri et al., 1999); con-<lb/>versely, for positive signal correlation, synergy is improved <lb/>by considering each neuron independently. It is likely that <lb/>both cases are produced by the connectivity patterns seen <lb/>in cortex. There are also cases where redundancy is de-<lb/>sirable, gaining reliability to the detriment of information <lb/>rate (Barlow, 2001). <lb/>Modelling studies (Kaschube et al., 2010) have suggested <lb/>that long range suppressive connections are in charge of <lb/>shaping maps and the existence of pinwheels, while local <lb/>connectivity might dictate arrangement in areas lacking <lb/>orderly maps as is the case of mouse auditory (and visual) <lb/>cortex. However, connectivity patterns and the role they <lb/>play might di↵er across layers. A previous report from the <lb/>upper layers of auditory cortex (Rothschild et al., 2010) <lb/>explained their findings by a tonotopically arranged input <lb/>(local neurons sharing common input) and random local <lb/>connectivity. This would explain the decrease in corre-<lb/>lation they observed as the distance in the coronal plane <lb/>increases and the variability seen at short distances, which <lb/>could be explained by overlapping sub-networks. The ex-<lb/>istence of such networks has been reported from studies <lb/>in rat visual cortex (Yoshimura et al., 2005; Yoshimura <lb/>and Callaway, 2005). In this study we found evidence for <lb/>functional sub-networks in deep layer of A1, however the <lb/>connectivity seen di↵ered from random. <lb/>In layer V, we found that connectivity was highly non-<lb/>random, and triplets of synaptically connected neurons <lb/>were the most common motif, despite their extremely low <lb/>probability of occurance, in agreement with a previous in-<lb/>vitro study (Song et al., 2005). Columnar processing has <lb/>long been assumed to be a hallmark of cortex, and a in-<lb/></body>

			<body>vitro study (Krieger et al., 2007) has suggested that an <lb/>aggregation of mini columns might act as a single func-<lb/>tional unit. Supporting this concept, we found that most <lb/>monosynaptic connections were between neurons located <lb/>on di↵erent vertical bundles (given by their separation <lb/>along the rostro-caudal axis), the fact that synaptic pairs <lb/>were on average synergistic supports the idea of functional <lb/>aggregation of adjacent columns. Further studies with <lb/>recording arrays spanning several mini columns may al-<lb/>low a thorough characterization of connectivity between <lb/>them, and the determination of their functional correlates <lb/>in-vivo. <lb/></body>
