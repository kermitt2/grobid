We examine in detail the <lb/>accrual experience of the Cooperative Group phase III trials. <lb/>Patients and Methods <lb/>All Cooperative Group phase III trials activated from 2000 to 2007 were examined for their accrual <lb/>experience. For trials that stopped accrual with Ͻ 90% of their accrual goal, the reasons for <lb/>having Ͻ 90% accrual were documented. We focus on trials that ended with Ͻ 90% accrual <lb/>because of inadequate accrual rates rather than for other reasons, such as an interim monitoring <lb/>analysis by an independent data monitoring committee that stops the trial early because one <lb/>treatment is clearly superior. <lb/>Results <lb/>There were 191 trials activated from 2000 to 2007. We project that 22.0% of these trials will <lb/>have Ͻ 90% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates. We project that there will be 176,627 <lb/>patients eventually accrued on the 191 trials (current accrual, 154,579) and that 2,991of these <lb/>patients will be on trials that have Ͻ 90% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates (1.7%). For <lb/>nonpediatric cancer trials, the corresponding percentages are 26.7% and 2.0%. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>We find that insufficient accrual rates are not as high as previously reported and that only a small <lb/>proportion of patients were enrolled on trials that ended with insufficient accrual because of an <lb/>inadequate accrual rate. NCI has implemented new procedures to reduce the number of trials that <lb/>fail to reach their accrual goals and to minimize the number of patients accrued on these trials. <lb/>J Clin Oncol 28:5197-5201.

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of <lb/>the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supports phase <lb/>III clinical trials primarily through the NCI Clinical <lb/>Trials Cooperative Group program. There are cur-<lb/>rently approximately 100 such trials actively accru-<lb/>ing patients. Although many Cooperative Group <lb/>phase III trials have led to major advances in the <lb/>treatment of cancer patients, 1 a proportion of trials <lb/>are never completed because they do not achieve a <lb/>sufficient accrual to meet their scientific objectives. <lb/>Such trials represent loss of the resources that went <lb/>into designing the trials, getting them activated, and <lb/>treating the patients accrued on the trials, as well as <lb/>not utilizing the efforts of the participating patients. <lb/>In addition, an ongoing trial may preclude opening <lb/>other trials in the same disease setting that might <lb/>have been successfully completed. As part of ongo-<lb/>ing efforts to improve the efficiency of the NCI clin-<lb/>ical trials program, we have performed an in-depth <lb/>review of the accrual experience from Cooperative <lb/>Group phase III trials activated from 2000 to 2007. <lb/>PATIENTS AND METHODS <lb/>Trial Information <lb/>All CTEP-supported phase III trials led by an NCI-<lb/>sponsored Cooperative Group or conducted as part of an <lb/>international collaboration with a Cooperative Group that <lb/>were activated in the years 2000 to 2007 were identified. <lb/>Trials were categorized as having accrual finished or not, <lb/>with the latter category including trials that were tempo-<lb/>rarily closed to accrual. The accrual goal of the trial was <lb/>taken from the latest CTEP-approved version of the trial <lb/>protocol. The percent accrued for the trial was calculated <lb/>as the current or final accrual divided by the accrual goal of <lb/>the trial. Closed trials with Ͻ 90% accrued were consid-<lb/>ered not fully accrued. Trials not fully accrued were cate-<lb/>gorized for the reason they stopped accruing by using the <lb/></body>

			<body>following categories: (a) external information (eg, results of another clinical <lb/>trial that answered the current trial question or rendered it irrelevant), (b) <lb/>formal interim monitoring of the current trial by an independent data moni-<lb/>toring committee (either for showing one of the trial arms superior or for <lb/>futility/inefficacy of the experimental treatment arm), (c) unacceptable toxic-<lb/>ity, (d) drug supply issues, or (e) inadequate accrual rate. Information for <lb/>performing the categorization was obtained from administrative documents <lb/>(eg, protocol amendments and protocol status updates), trial publications, <lb/>and CTEP investigators. Trials were additionally categorized by the primary <lb/>disease site, whether or not the trial involved a randomization (some pediatric <lb/>phase III trials use historical controls), and whether or not the trial involved an <lb/>investigational new drug agent. <lb/>Statistical Analyses <lb/>Trials that were closed to accrual with Ͻ 90% of their accrual goal were <lb/>considered to have insufficient accrual, with the 90% figure chosen prospec-<lb/>tively before the analysis was begun. Considering that the statistical power of a <lb/>trial is typically based on an estimated number of events that will be observed <lb/>(which depends on the length of the follow-up), we believe that trials that <lb/>achieve Ն 90% of their accrual goal can be considered successfully accrued <lb/>from a statistical point of view. One parameter of interest is the probability that <lb/>a trial activated from 2000 to 2007 will have insufficient accrual because of an <lb/>inadequate accrual rate (category (e) above). Since not all trials activated from <lb/>2000 to 2007 have completed accrual, this parameter needs to be estimated. If <lb/>one estimates solely from trials that have closed to accrual, then the estimator <lb/>will be subject to sampling bias. (This is the same type of bias one would <lb/>observe by trying to estimate median patient survival in a clinical trial by using <lb/>the median survival of only those patients who have died.) To avoid sampling <lb/>bias, statistical methods for survival data that account for censored observa-<lb/>tions were used that adjust for actively accruing trials. In particular, (1) the unit <lb/>of analysis is the trial, (2) &quot;time&quot; on study is the percentage accrued for the trial, <lb/>(3) the trial is considered as having the &quot;event of interest&quot; if the trial stopped <lb/>accruing with Ͻ 90% accrued because of inadequate accrual, (4) trials that <lb/>stopped with Ͻ 90% accrual for other reasons (eg, interim monitoring) are <lb/>considered a competing risk, and (5) trials that are still actively accruing are <lb/>treated as censored observations. (Trials that have accrual temporarily sus-<lb/>pended are considered active). In this framework, the parameter of interest is <lb/>the crude cumulative incidence 2 evaluated at 90% percent accrued. <lb/>Other parameters of interest are a projection of the number of patients <lb/>who will be accrued to trials that will have insufficient accrual because of an <lb/>inadequate accrual rate and the proportion of such patients compared with the <lb/>total number of patients who will be accrued to all trials. To obtain estimators <lb/>of these parameters, survival methods were applied with the analyses weighted <lb/>by the accrual goal for each trial (details are found in the Appendix, on-<lb/>line only). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>One hundred ninety-one phase III trials were activated from 2000 to <lb/>2007 (Table 1). Figure 1 displays a histogram of the percentage accrued <lb/>for the 133 trials for which accrual has finished; trials having an <lb/>inadequate accrual rate are shown in gold. The estimate of the propor-<lb/>tion of trials that have insufficient accrual because of an inadequate <lb/>accrual rate is 22.0%. This estimate is remarkably similar to the naive <lb/>proportion of trials that had an inadequate accrual rate (21.5%; 41 of <lb/>191), which would be an appropriate estimator if we knew that all <lb/>actively accruing trials would eventually achieve at least 90% accrual. <lb/>The reason for this is that practically all of the actively accruing trials <lb/>are already past the point (in terms of percent accrued) at which trials <lb/>that are going to stop because of inadequate accrual would have <lb/>stopped (Fig 2). In particular, 85% (35 of 41) of the trials that closed <lb/>for inadequate accrual rates had Ͻ 20% accrued (Fig 1), and 91% (53 <lb/>of 58) of the trials still accruing already have Ͼ 20% accrued (Fig 2). <lb/>The estimate of the proportion of patients enrolled on trials <lb/>that had insufficient accrual because of an inadequate accrual <lb/>rate is 1.7%, representing a projected 2,991 patients of a pro-<lb/>jected 176,627 that will eventually be accrued to all 191 trials. This <lb/>low percentage reflects the obvious point that trials stopped for <lb/>inadequate accrual will tend to have only a small number of pa-<lb/>tients accrued. <lb/>When examined by primary disease site (Table 2), the pediat-<lb/>ric cancer trials have a smaller proportion of trials with inadequate <lb/>accrual rate leading to Ͻ 90% accrued than the adult cancer trials. <lb/>In fact, only two of the 42 pediatric trials had Ͻ 90% accrued <lb/>because of an inadequate accrual rate. For the adult cancer trials, <lb/>the breast cancer trials appear to have fewer trials with inadequate <lb/>accrual rates. None of the 15 phase III trials with nonrandomized <lb/>designs had Ͻ 90% accrued because of an inadequate accrual rate <lb/>(Table 3); these trials were all pediatric cancer trials. There is no <lb/>substantial difference in the proportion of inadequately accruing <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>trials depending on whether or not the trial involved an investiga-<lb/>tional new drug agent (Table 3). <lb/>Although Ն 90% accrual was the prospectively defined cutoff for <lb/>sufficient accrual, similar results are obtained by using a 95% cutoff. <lb/>Using a 95% cutoff, the estimate of the proportion of trials that have <lb/>insufficient accrual because of an inadequate accrual rate is 22.8% <lb/>(instead of 22.0%), and the estimate of the proportion of patients <lb/>enrolled on trials that had insufficient accrual because of inadequate <lb/>accrual rate is 2.2% (instead of 1.7%). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Cheng et al 3 report 49.2% (30 of 61) of CTEP-approved nonpediatric <lb/>phase III trials failed to achieve at least 25% of accrual goals. Recently, <lb/>the Institute of Medicine reported that 40% of CTEP-approved phase <lb/>III trials failed to achieve minimum accrual goals, 4 a figure that has <lb/>been repeated elsewhere. 5-7 We report here that we estimate that <lb/>28.3% of such nonpediatric trials will fail to achieve at least 90% of <lb/>their accrual goals because of inadequate accrual, based on data from <lb/>149 trials (Table 2). The difference between the results can be attrib-<lb/>uted to exclusion of actively accruing trials by Cheng et al 3 (leading to <lb/>sampling bias) and their inclusion, as failures to achieve accrual goals, <lb/>of trials that ended for other reasons besides inadequate accrual. 4 We <lb/>have chosen not to consider trials that failed to achieve at least 90% of <lb/>their accrual goals because of formal interim monitoring, unaccept-<lb/>able toxicity, or drug supply issues as failures. This is an obvious <lb/>decision for trials that closed because of interim monitoring, and one <lb/>could argue for the other categories that failure to fully accrue was <lb/>beyond the control of the investigators. <lb/>Overall, we estimate that 22.0% of all trials (adult and pediatric) <lb/>will end with insufficient accrual because of inadequate accrual rates, <lb/>and 1.7% of the total number of patients accrued on all trials will be on <lb/>these trials. It is possible that a trial that ends with accrual Ͻ 90% of <lb/>projected because of an inadequate accrual rate can still provide useful <lb/>clinical information. For example, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology <lb/>Group (ECOG) E4201 trial, 8 which closed to accrual with 74 of 332 <lb/>patients accrued, demonstrated the major advance of treating locally <lb/>inoperable pancreatic cancer with radiation therapy in addition to <lb/>gemcitabine. 9 Another example is given by the Radiation Therapy <lb/>Oncology Group (RTOG) 9813 trial, which closed to accrual with 201 <lb/>of 454 patients accrued and is in follow-up.

			<body>treating anaplastic astrocytomas or mixed gliomas, may still provide <lb/>relevant clinical information. Much more likely, trials that end early <lb/>because of inadequate accrual will provide little useful clinical data. <lb/>Although the number of patients involved in these trials is small <lb/>(compared with the number of patients on all trials), there are still <lb/>considerable resources involved in opening a trial, whether or not <lb/>it accrues. <lb/>Should one aim for a clinical trials program to open only trials in <lb/>which one is positive that they will accrue successfully? We would <lb/>argue no, because this would preclude starting trials that address <lb/>important questions but in which it is known at the start that accrual <lb/>will be challenging. For example, the Surgical Prostatectomy Versus <lb/>Interstitial Radiation Intervention Trial (SPIRIT; American College of <lb/>Surgeons Oncology Group [ACOSOG] Z0070), comparing radical <lb/>prostatectomy versus brachytherapy in early-stage prostate cancer, <lb/>accrued only 56 of a required 1,980 patients. Another example is given <lb/>by the Southwest Oncology Group S0521 trial, which compared <lb/>maintenance chemotherapy versus observation in patients with pre-<lb/>viously untreated low-and intermediate-risk acute promyelocytic leu-<lb/>kemia. It accrued only 95 of a required 500 patients. Yet experts often <lb/>cite the strong need for clinical trials for both these questions. <lb/>Although we believe it is important to attempt to perform impor-<lb/>tant trials that may be a challenge for enrollment, it is also important to <lb/>minimize the time and number of patients involved in trials that turn <lb/>out to have insufficient accrual. One strategy is to examine characteris-<lb/>tics of inadequately accrued trials to help inform trial prioritization. 10 <lb/>A second strategy is to open a trial first in a limited number of <lb/>institutions to assess accrual feasibility. This strategy was used in the <lb/>Surveillance Therapy Against Radical Treatment (START) trial (Na-<lb/>tional Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group [NCIC CTG] <lb/>PR.11), testing radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy versus active <lb/>surveillance for favorable-risk prostate cancer. <lb/>A third strategy is to stop trials early when it is apparent they will <lb/>never reach their accrual goals because of inadequate accrual rates. To <lb/>this end, we developed CTEP early-stopping guidelines 11 that apply to <lb/>slow-accruing phase III Cooperative Group trials activated after April <lb/>1, 2004 (trials that have Ͻ 20% of their projected accrual rates in <lb/>quarters 5 and 6 after their activation are closed). (Twenty-six of the 41 <lb/>trials that had inadequate accrual rates in Table 1 were activated before <lb/>April 1, 2004.) These guidelines were based on historical data that <lb/>demonstrated that trials with poor accrual in this time interval would <lb/>be extremely unlikely to ever reach their accrual goals. 12 Our experi-<lb/>ence with the CTEP early-stopping guidelines will be reported when <lb/>we have further follow-up of the trials activated after April 1, 2004. <lb/>A fourth strategy is to simplify the enrollment process and ex-<lb/>pand patient entry onto trials. To this end, CTEP has developed the <lb/>Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU), 13 which allows for a larger num-<lb/>ber of institutions to enter patients into different Cooperative Group <lb/>trials in an efficient manner. This strategy appears to be successful, <lb/>because CTEP data (not shown) indicate that cross-Group accrual <lb/>(enrollments from Groups other than the lead Group) has increased <lb/>from an average of 20% in the pre-CTSU 1990s to 40% in the post-<lb/>CTSU 2000s. <lb/>A fifth strategy is to simplify the data collection required for <lb/>patients on trials, which may encourage physicians to participate. <lb/>CTEP is working with the US Food and Drug Administration to reduce <lb/>certain types of adverse event reporting, which may help in this regard. 14 <lb/>Finally, because slow development of a trial concept to a protocol <lb/>ready for enrollment is associated with its ability to achieve its accrual <lb/>goal, 3 CTEP, working in concert with the Cooperative Groups, devel-<lb/>oped the Central Institutional Review Board for faster protocol re-<lb/>view 15 and has recently instituted new timelines for all phases of trial <lb/>development. 16 The target timelines to move from a trial concept to a <lb/>protocol ready for accrual for phase II and III Cooperative Group trials <lb/>have been reduced to 7 and 10 months, respectively, a Ͼ 50% reduc-<lb/>tion from current timelines. If these target timelines are achieved, then <lb/>we will be able to determine whether this promising approach is <lb/>indeed successful in reducing the number of trials that fail to meet <lb/>their accrual goal. <lb/></body>
