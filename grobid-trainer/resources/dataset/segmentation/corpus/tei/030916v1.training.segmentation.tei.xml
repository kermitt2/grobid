			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The &apos;priming effect&apos; refers to changes in the remineralization rate of recalcitrant <lb/>organic matter due to nonlinear interactions among substances in the environ-<lb/>ment (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). Although this effect has been the subject of <lb/>intensive study in soils, it has only recently begun to attract substantial atten-<lb/>tion in aquatic systems (Guenet et al., 2010; Bianchi, 2011). Among aquatic <lb/>systems, the priming effect may be particularly relevant in estuaries, where <lb/>labile organic matter (OM, for instance autochthonous production) mix with <lb/>more recalcitrant OM, such as aged terrestrial OM and recalcitrant marine OM <lb/>(Guenet et al., 2010). Despite the voluminous evidence for the priming effect <lb/>in soils (Kuzyakov, 2010), the evidence for priming in aquatic systems is more <lb/>ambiguous. Several studies using unlabeled additions of labile organic matter <lb/>to aquatic ecosystems showed by mass balance that additions of labile OM must <lb/>have stimulated oxidation of more recalcitrant OM (De Haan, 1977; Shimp and <lb/>Pfaender, 1985; Carlson et al., 2002; Farjalla et al., 2009; Hansell and Carlson, <lb/>2013); other investigators in freshwater environments have not found evidence <lb/>for the priming effect (Bengtsson et al., 2014; Catalán et al., 2015). With the <lb/>exception of Farjalla et al. (2009), which concerns a tropical lagoon, these stud-<lb/>ies were not performed in estuaries. Perhaps more importantly, the priming <lb/>effect refers to changes in remineralization of recalcitrant OM in response to <lb/>the addition of more labile OM and/or nutrients. It can be challenging to dis-<lb/>tinguish remineralization of labile versus recalcitrant OM using a mass-balance <lb/>approach, in which only total fluxes of CO 2 are measured, because these ap-<lb/>proaches do not distinguish between oxidation of pre-existing, recalcitrant OM <lb/>and added labile OM. Here we report the results of microcosm incubations to <lb/>assess the extent to which additions of labile OM (as either acetate or bovine <lb/>serum albumin, a protein) or nutrients (N and/or P) influenced the remineraliza-<lb/>tion rates of biodegraded phytoplankton necromass by a surface water microbial <lb/>community collected from a temperate coastal estuary (Grove&apos;s Creek, Georgia, <lb/>USA). Phytoplankton were labeled with 14 C so fluxes of 14 CO 2 derived from <lb/>phytoplankton necromass could unambiguously be distinguished from unlabeled <lb/>CO 2 derived from labile carbon. Periodic measurements of cell abundance, ex-<lb/>tracellular enzyme activities, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence <lb/>provided insight into the mechanisms of interactions between labile OM, nu-<lb/>trients, and phytoplankton necromass. These microcosms provided a tractable <lb/>experimental system in which to determine whether the priming effect may <lb/>plausibly influence remineralization rates of recalcitrant OM in estuaries. <lb/>2 Materials and Methods <lb/>2.1 Generation of 14 C-labeled organic matter <lb/>The marine phytoplankter Synechococcus sp. strain CB0101 was grown on <lb/>SN15 medium (750 mL filtered seawater, 250 mL distilled water, 2.5 mL 3.53 <lb/></body>

Stationary phase cultures were collected on 0.22 μM Supor <lb/>filters (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) and resuspended in artificial <lb/>seawater (ASW) (Sigma Sea Salts, 20 g/L [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]), pH <lb/>8.1. A microbial community inoculum (collected at Bogue Sound, NC, from the <lb/>dock of the Institute of Marine Sciences, University of North Carolina-Chapel <lb/>Hill) was added to the phytoplankton biomass at 1% v/v and incubated in the <lb/>dark at room temperature for 45 days. During the course of the incubation, <lb/>the quantity of O 14 C was periodically measured using a Perkin-Elmer TriCarb <lb/>2910-TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). The con-<lb/>centration of remaining OC was calculated by assuming the specific activity of <lb/>phytoplankton-derived OC was equal to the specific activity of DI 14 C in the <lb/>growth medium. <lb/>Phytoplankton OC decay was assumed to follow first-order kinetics: <lb/>OC t = OC 0 e −kt <lb/>(1) <lb/>where OC t is the concentration of organic carbon at time t, OC 0 is the <lb/>initial concentration of organic carbon, and k is the decay rate constant. k was <lb/>determined from a nonlinear least squares regression of the OC concentration <lb/>data to equation 1, and half-life was calculated as t 1/2 = ln(2)/k. At the end of <lb/>this initial degradation phase, 14 C-POM was collected by filtration (0.22 μm), <lb/>resuspended in ASW (salinity = 20) and heat killed by boiling for 5 min. The <lb/>POM was allowed to return to room temperature and added to the microcosms <lb/>as described below. <lb/>2.2 Microcosm incubations <lb/>Microcosms containing 1 mM PO 14 C were established using combinations of <lb/>labile carbon, in the form of sodium acetate or protein (bovine serum albumin <lb/>[BSA]), phosphorus as phosphate, and/or nitrogen as ammonium. The labile <lb/>carbon, N, and P were added at final concentrations of 500 μM-C, 75 μM-N, <lb/>and 4.7 μM-P, respectively. BSA contains both C and N, at a ratio of 6.6 C:N. <lb/>Thus, the concentration of inorganic N added to select microcosms was chosen <lb/>to match this ratio. The P concentration was selected based on the Redfield <lb/>ratio for N:P of 16. The treatments were as follows: (1) sodium acetate (250 <lb/>μM acetate or 500 μM-C); (2) protein plus P (500 μM-C as BSA, 75 μM-N as <lb/>BSA, 4.7 μM K 2 HPO 4 ); (3) N (75 μM NH 4 Cl); (4) N plus P (75 μM NH 4 Cl, <lb/>4.7 μM-K 2 HPO 4 ); and (5) control treatment with no C, N or P addition. <lb/>Microcosms were constructed as follows: the natural microbial community <lb/>was obtained by pre-filtering a sample of estuarine water (from Skidaway Is-<lb/></body>

			<body>land, Georgia) using a Whatman GF/A filter (Whatman, GE Healthcare Bio-<lb/>sciences Corporation, Piscataway, NJ; nominal pore size 1.6 μm) to reduce grazer <lb/>abundance. Prefiltered estuarine water was then filtered onto a 0.22 μm filter <lb/>(Supor-200 Pall Corp, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells captured on the second filter were <lb/>resuspended into artificial seawater (Sigma Sea Salts, 15.0 g/L). The cell sus-<lb/>pension was mixed and then 3.9 mL was dispensed into master mixes for each <lb/>treatment with 383 mL artificial seawater (15.0 g/L, adjusted to pH 8.1) for a <lb/>targeted cell density of 10 6 cells ml −1 . C, N and P were added to the master <lb/>mixes as appropriate for each treatment, and PO14C (0.3779 μCi/ 1 mg PO 14 C) <lb/>was added to each master mix for a final concentration of 1 mM OC. 65 mL of <lb/>each master mix was dispensed after gentle mixing into five replicate, 125 mL <lb/>serum vials and capped with gastight butyl stoppers (National Scientific Supply, <lb/>Rockwood, TN). The microcosms were then incubated in an incubator at 25 o <lb/>C in the dark. <lb/>2.3 14 C measurements <lb/>Throughout the course of the first 36 days of incubation, samples were collected <lb/>to monitor the concentrations of total 14 C labeled organic carbon (O 14 C), par-<lb/>ticulate organic carbon (PO 14 C) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DI 14 C). Total <lb/>O 14 C was measured on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 17, 20, 22, 27, 30 and 36; <lb/>PO 14 C was measured on days 0, 1, 2, 8, 14, 22, 30 and 36; and DI 14 C was mea-<lb/>sured on days 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 17, 20, 22, 27, 30 and 36. In all cases, 0.5 ml <lb/>samples were collected from serum vials using a 22.5-guage needle and a 1 ml sy-<lb/>ringe. To quantify total O 14 C, the sample was added to a 20 ml scintillation vial <lb/>preloaded with 50 μL of 10% H 2 SO 4 , to drive off 14 CO 2 . Samples were allowed <lb/>to degas for 15 minutes in a fume hood. Finally, 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation <lb/>cocktail (National Diagnostics, Mississauga, OH) was added to each serum vial. <lb/>To quantify PO 14 C, the samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter polycar-<lb/>bonate filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The filters were added to scintillation <lb/>vials containing 5 mL of scintillation fluid. To quantify DI 14 C, samples were <lb/>initially stored with 50 μL of 1 M NaOH. Just prior to measurement with a <lb/>Perkin-Elmer TriCarb 2910-TR scintillation counter, samples were acidified by <lb/>the addition of 0.5 mL of 0.2 M HCl. CO 2 was trapped by bubbling a stream <lb/>of air through the sample into a 20 mL scintillation vial with a Teflon-septum <lb/>cap containing 10 mL modified Woellers solution (50% scintillation fluid/50% <lb/>β-phenylethylamine) for 20 minutes (Steen et al., 2012) . Tests with NaH 14 CO 3 <lb/>standards indicated 14 CO 2 trapping efficiency was at least 95%. For all scin-<lb/>tillation measurements, vials were vortexed, allowed to &apos;rest&apos; for 24-72 hours, <lb/>and vortexed again prior to measurement in order to minimize particle-induced <lb/>quenching. <lb/>2.4 Modeling 14 C data <lb/>Total O 14 C and PO 14 C data were modeled assuming a reactive fraction, which <lb/>decayed according to first-order kinetics, plus an unreactive fraction, in accor-<lb/></body>

These models were fit to the data using nonlinear <lb/>least squares regressions, with k and R as fitted parameters and OC 0 as a <lb/>constant determined from measurements of the source phytoplankton (960 μM-<lb/>C for total OC, 926 μM-C for POC). CO 2 production was modeled similarly <lb/>(Eq. 3), assuming that the only source of 14 CO 2 was the remineralization of <lb/>recalcitrant O 14 C. <lb/>CO 2t = A 1 − e −kt <lb/>(3) <lb/>95% confidence intervals were calculated using a Monte Carlo algorithm as <lb/>implemented in the propagate R package. For the CO 2 data, priming at time <lb/>t was defined as <lb/>p t = <lb/>ΣCO 2treatment,t <lb/>ΣCO 2control,t <lb/>− 1 <lb/>(4) <lb/>Because observed 14 CO 2 concentrations were non-normally distributed and <lb/>temporally autocorrelated, a custom permutation test was used to test the null <lb/>hypothesis that observed priming in each experimental treatment on each day <lb/>was indistinguishable from zero (see R code in supplemental information). <lb/>2.5 Potential extracellular enzyme activities <lb/>Activities of three different extracellular enzymes were assayed during the course <lb/>of the incubations on days 0 (3 hours after the start of incubations), 7, 16, 21, <lb/>29 and 35. β-glucosidase was assessed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-gluco-<lb/>pyranoside (MUB-β-glu; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a final concentra-<lb/>tion of 200 μM. Leucyl aminopeptidase was assessed using l-leucine-7-amido-<lb/>4-methylcoumarin (Leu-AMC; Chem-Impex International Inc., Wood Dale, IL) <lb/>at a final concentration 400 μM. Alkaline phosphatase was assessed using 4-<lb/>methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUB−PO 4 ; Chem-Impex International Inc, Wood <lb/>Dale, IL) at a final concentration 50 μM. At each measurement timepoint, 0.5 <lb/>ml of each sample was added to 0.5 ml artificial seawater buffer and a small <lb/>volume of substrate (MUB-β-glu: 20 μL, Leu-AMC: 20 μL, MUB-PO4: 50 μL). <lb/>Cuvettes were capped and shaken and incubated at 22 o C. Fluorescence was <lb/>periodically measured using a QuantiFluor ST single-cuvette fluorimeter over <lb/>the course of approximately 2 hours as described in (Steen and Arnosti, 2013). <lb/>Fluorescence values were calibrated with 4-methylumbelliferone and 7-amido-<lb/>4-methylcoumarin as appropriate, and were analyzed using the enzalyze package <lb/>for analysis of enzyme kinetics in R, available at http://github.com/adsteen/enzalyze. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.6 Cell counts <lb/>Cell densities were assessed on days 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 17, 20, 22, 27, 30, 36 and <lb/>57 days by microscopic direct counting following (Ortmann and Suttle, 2009). <lb/>0.5 mL of sample were taken from replicate A of each treatment and stored in <lb/>cryovials. 10 μL of 25% filter-sterilized glutaraldehyde was added to the samples. <lb/>Samples were stored at -80 o C. 100 μL of sample was added to 900 L of water. <lb/>50 μL of SYBR gold (25X) was added to each sample. Samples were incubated <lb/>in the dark for 15 minutes. Stained samples were vacuum filtered through a <lb/>0.22 μm filter. The filter was removed and placed on a glass slide. 20 μL of <lb/>anti-fade solution (480 μL 50% glycerol / 50% PBS; 20 μL p-phenylenediamine) <lb/>was added on top of the filter on the slide before placing a cover slip on the <lb/>slide. Bacteria were manually enumerated using a Leica CTR6000 microscope <lb/>(Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). <lb/>2.7 Fluorescence spectroscopy of dissolved organic matter <lb/>Based on preliminary evidence that conditions in the treatments had begun <lb/>to converge by 36 days, after 57 days we assessed the character of remaining <lb/>DOM in selected samples using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence <lb/>spectroscopy. Due to the radioactive nature of the samples, fluorescence spectra <lb/>were measured in sealed 1 cm × 1 cm methacrylate cuvettes (Fisher Scientific, <lb/>Waltham, MA), which are advertised as transparent above 285 nm. In order <lb/>to control for potential variability in optical properties among cuvettes, a Milli-<lb/>Q water blank was measured in each cuvette prior to adding sample. For each <lb/>measurement, a blank UV-vis absorbance scan was collected using Milli-Q water <lb/>water on a Thermo Scientific Evolution 200 series spectrophotometer, and a <lb/>blank fluorescence scan was collected on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax 4 <lb/>fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan). The excitation <lb/>scan was from 240-450 nm in 5 nm increments, and the emission scan was from <lb/>250-550 nm in 2.5 nm increments. Finally, the Milli-Q water was removed from <lb/>the cuvette, sample water was added and diluted 50% with Milli-Q water, and <lb/>a sample fluorescence scan was collected using the same instrument settings. <lb/>Sample 5B, which had an unacceptable blank, was discarded. <lb/>UV scans indicated that the methacrylate cuvettes began to absorb light <lb/>below about 290 nm, so all excitation and emission wavelengths shorter than 295 <lb/>nm were discarded. Sample fluorescence spectra were then corrected for inner-<lb/>filtering effects, blank-subtracted, normalized to the appropriate days Raman <lb/>spectrum, and masked for Raman and Rayleigh scattering. <lb/>BSA was the only fluorescent priming compound. For that reason, an initial <lb/>fluorescence sample was taken from the control treatment prior to the addition <lb/>of any priming compounds, and a separate initial sample was taken from the <lb/>+BSA+P treatment to assess the fluorescence characteristics of the added BSA. <lb/>Duplicate final samples were taken after 57 days incubation from each treatment. <lb/>EEMs data analysis techniques can be highly sensitive to the specific condi-<lb/>tions under which fluorescence EEMs were measured (Cory et al., 2010).

While the magnitude of anti-priming in <lb/>the +acetate treatment was nearly constant throughout the incubation, positive <lb/>priming in the +BSA+P treatment (and the +N+P treatments, if the observed <lb/>priming in that treatment was not due to experimental error) was maximal at <lb/>the first timepoint after labile organic matter was added, and decreased steadily <lb/>thereafter. After 30-36 days of incubation, the total amount of 14 CO 2 reminer-<lb/>alized was indistinguishable among all treatments. <lb/></body>

In this treatment, the protein peak from the added BSA (visible at <lb/>the bottom of the panel for the initial +BSA+P treatment in Fig 4) dominated <lb/>the phytoplankton recalcitrant OM signal.

Therefore we refer to this material as &apos;recalcitrant&apos;. <lb/>4.2 Role of P and labile organic C in recalcitrant OM <lb/>mineralization <lb/>The results provide evidence of faster OM mineralization in the presence of <lb/>added protein plus phosphate (+BSA+P treatment) and possibly added inor-<lb/>ganic N and phosphate (+N+P), but not inorganic N alone (+N). These data <lb/>suggest that heterotrophic metabolism of recalcitrant OM was limited in part <lb/>by phosphorus. It is important to note that the factors limiting the remineral-<lb/>ization of recalcitrant OM may differ from the factors limiting overall bacterial <lb/>production. There was also a clear interaction between the form of N and P: the <lb/>magnitude of early priming was about twice as large in the +BSA+P treatment <lb/>as in the +N+P treatment. Consistent with reports from soils that addition of <lb/>labile carbon without nutrients can induce microbial community shifts towards <lb/>organisms specialized for mineralizing simple molecules (Fontaine et al., 2003), <lb/>addition of acetate slowed the remineralization rate of the phytoplankton detri-<lb/>tus. Thus, the magnitude and even direction of priming was influenced by both <lb/></body>

			<body>the redox status of nutrients (organic versus inorganic) as well as the nature of <lb/>organic carbon. <lb/>4.3 Priming as a transient effect <lb/>Recalcitrant OM was remineralized up to 100% faster in the +BSA+P treat-<lb/>ment than in the control, but this effect was transient (Fig 3). After about 30 <lb/>days, roughly the same amount of recalcitrant OM had been mineralized in each <lb/>experiment. Cell densities (Fig 4) and enzyme activities (Fig 5) also converged <lb/>towards the end of the experiment. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that, <lb/>after 57 days of incubation, the composition of fluorescent DOM was indistin-<lb/>guishable among all treatments except for +BSA+P. In that treatment a large <lb/>protein-like peak persisted at the end of the incubation, consistent with abiotic <lb/>production of microbially unavailable protein(Keil and Kirchman, 1994) (Fig <lb/>6). <lb/>Interestingly, Catalán et al. (2015) recently found no evidence of priming in <lb/>Swedish lakes. That study contained a very large number of experimental treat-<lb/>ments, but only a single timepoint, after 35 days of incubation, whereas in the <lb/>experiment reported here, priming effects were no longer observable after 21 -24 <lb/>days. The priming effect arises from interactions between disparate microorgan-<lb/>isms and pools of organic carbon and nutrients (Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov, <lb/>2008). Given the complexities of these interactions, it is likely that the magni-<lb/>tude, direction and timing of priming varies substantially among aquatic envi-<lb/>ronments. <lb/>4.4 Mechanisms of priming <lb/>Cell abundances, leucyl aminopeptidase activity and phosphatase activity all <lb/>increased substantially and rapidly in the +BSA+P treatment (Figs 4 and 6). <lb/>These are consistent with a scenario in which cells grew rapidly using BSA <lb/>as substrate, producing excess leucyl aminopeptidase, which acted on other <lb/>protein-like components of the recalcitrant O 14 C. Kuzyakov et al. (2000) cite <lb/>changes in microbial biomass as a primary mechanism of priming in soils. Sur-<lb/>prisingly, alkaline phosphatase activity also increased in the +BSA+P treat-<lb/>ment, despite the substantial addition of P in that treatment. Some marine <lb/>bacteria produce alkaline phosphatase constituitively (Hassan and Pratt, 1977), <lb/>which may account for the observed increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in <lb/>the +BSA+P treatment here. Alternatively, since the peak in phosphatase ac-<lb/>tivity occurred at 17 days while cell abundance was declining, it is possible that <lb/>the extracellular phosphatase enzymes may have been released from cytoplasm <lb/>as cells lysed following the peak in cell abundance at day 3. In either case, the <lb/>observed increase in the activity of phosphatase provides mechanistic support <lb/>for the hypothesis that addition of one compound can spur hydrolysis of chem-<lb/>ically unrelated compounds, thereby making them bioavailable. Many aquatic <lb/>extracellular peptidases (protein-degrading enzymes) are relatively promiscuous <lb/></body>

			<body>(Steen et al., 2015) which suggests that peptidases produced in order to degrade <lb/>BSA likely hydrolyzed some fraction of the recalcitrant O 14 C as well. <lb/>4.5 Relevance to carbon processing in estuaries <lb/>Priming in this study was substantial but transient. The relevant priming <lb/>timescale observed here of days-to-tens-of-days, coincides with typical hydro-<lb/>logic residence times of passive-margin estuaries (Alber and Sheldon, 1999). <lb/>Priming in estuaries may therefore influence whether OC is remineralized in <lb/>situ or exported to the coastal ocean. <lb/>Is the priming effect that we observed in microcosm incubations with defined <lb/>substrate additions relevant to natural systems? In estuaries, degraded OM <lb/>(e.g. terrestrial OM or dissolved remnants of coastal phytoplankton blooms) <lb/>can come into contact with fresh DOC produced in situ (Raymond and Bauer, <lb/>2001). Marsh grasses exude substantial amounts of labile compounds, including <lb/>acetate (Hines et al., 1994; Jones, 1998), and phytoplankton growing in estuaries <lb/>likely also serve as a source of labile OM (Carlson and Hansell, 2015). Here, we <lb/>have shown that estuarine microbial communities are capable of being &apos;primed&apos; <lb/>(or &apos;anti-primed&apos;) by the addition of labile OM and nutrients to mineralize re-<lb/>calcitrant OM more quickly. Inputs of labile carbon and nutrients may therefore <lb/>influence fluxes of less reactive OM between estuaries and the coastal ocean. <lb/></body>
