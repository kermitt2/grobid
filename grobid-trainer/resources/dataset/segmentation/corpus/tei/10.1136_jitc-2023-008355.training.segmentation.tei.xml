Published by <lb/>BMJ. <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Background Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and <lb/>intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) are associated with <lb/>poor patient outcomes. Intraventricular fibrinolysis is <lb/>effective in clearing IVH and improving patient survival <lb/>and neurological outcome. By similar rationale, cisternal <lb/>irrigation has been proposed as a potential method to <lb/>accelerate haematoma clearance in SAH. We aimed <lb/>to provide a comprehensive review and meta-analysis <lb/>evaluating the effect of intraventricular and cisternal <lb/>irrigation on clinical outcomes in patients with SAH and <lb/>IVH. <lb/>Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic <lb/>Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed <lb/>preparing this systematic review and study selection <lb/>was performed by multiple investigators. We extracted <lb/>ORs from the individual studies and aggregated these <lb/>using a random effects model. The quality of evidence <lb/>was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, <lb/>Assessment, Development and Evaluations assessment <lb/>and ROBINS-I or RoB-2. <lb/>Results 24 articles were included. In SAH, we found that <lb/>cisternal irrigation with fibrinolytic agents was associated <lb/>with reduced mortality (OR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00), <lb/>higher probability of favourable functional outcome (OR: <lb/>1.80, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.51), and reduced risks of DCI (OR: <lb/>0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42) and cerebral vasospasm (OR: <lb/>0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42), compared with conventional <lb/>therapy. Cisternal irrigation with vasodilatory agents was <lb/>associated with lower mortality (OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to <lb/>0.79) and reduced risk of cerebral vasospasm (OR: 0.37, <lb/>95% CI 0.17 to 0.79). The evidence for irrigation therapy <lb/>of IVH was sparse and insufficient to show any significant <lb/>effect. <lb/>Conclusion In this study, we found that cisternal <lb/>irrigation could improve the prognosis in patients with SAH <lb/>compared with conventional therapy. There is no evidence <lb/>to support cisternal irrigation treatment of IVH. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage <lb/>(SAH) and intraventricular haemorrhage <lb/>(IVH) are catastrophic cerebrovascular <lb/>events associated with high mortality and <lb/>severe morbidity. 1-3 Direct exposure of cere-<lb/>bral vessels to the neuroinflammatory effects <lb/>of haemoglobin degradation products is <lb/>considered to play a major role in the patho-<lb/>genesis of cerebral vasospasm and delayed <lb/>cerebral ischaemia (DCI), being a compli-<lb/>cating cause of morbidity in approximately <lb/>one in four SAH survivors. 4 Likewise, in IVH, <lb/>haematoma formation and blood degradation <lb/>products are associated with secondary neuro-<lb/>logical injuries due to obstructive hydroceph-<lb/>alus, mass effect and elevated intracranial <lb/>pressure. 2 Conventional treatment typically <lb/>includes supportive care and cerebrospinal <lb/>fluid drainage to decompress the intracranial <lb/>space and facilitate passive haematoma evac-<lb/>uation. 1 5 <lb/>A recent meta-analysis documented signif-<lb/>icant benefits from accelerated haematoma <lb/>clearance using intraventricular fibrinolysis <lb/>therapy, showing significant improvements <lb/>in survival rate and functional outcome, 6 <lb/>compared with passive drainage in patients <lb/>with IVH. Based on a similar rationale, intra-<lb/>ventricular and cisternal irrigation using <lb/></body>

        <front>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC <lb/>⇒ Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and intraventric-<lb/>ular haemorrhage are associated with poor patient <lb/>outcomes, however, cisternal and intraventricular <lb/>irrigation have been proposed to accelerate haema-<lb/>toma clearance and improve patient outcomes. <lb/>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS <lb/>⇒ We found that in patients with SAH, cisternal irri-<lb/>gation with fibrinolytic agents was associated with <lb/>reduced mortality, improved functional outcome, <lb/>and lower risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia and <lb/>vasospasms, compared with conventional therapy. <lb/>Cisternal irrigation with vasodilatory agents was as-<lb/>sociated with lower mortality and decreased risk of <lb/>cerebral vasospasms. <lb/>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, <lb/>PRACTICE OR POLICY <lb/>⇒ Fibrinolytic and vasodilatory cisternal irrigation may <lb/>be warranted in the treatment of SAH. Larger pro-<lb/>spective studies are needed to verify these results. <lb/>Stroke and Vascular Neurology: first published as 10.1136/svn-2023-003062 on 23 May 2024.

        <body>physiological saline combined with fibrinolytic or vasoac-<lb/>tive agents, has been proposed as a potential method to <lb/>further accelerate haematoma and toxin clearance and <lb/>thereby improve outcomes in both SAH and IVH. <lb/>In this study, we provide a systematic review and meta-<lb/>analysis of the current literature on intraventricular or <lb/>cisternal irrigation for SAH and IVH compared with <lb/>conventional therapy. We evaluate the efficacy of both <lb/>fibrinolytic and vasodilatory cisternal irrigation treatments <lb/>with respect to clinical endpoints; including mortality, <lb/>functional outcome, DCI and cerebral vasospasm. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Search strategy <lb/>The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred <lb/>Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses <lb/>criteria 7 (online supplemental tables S1 and S2). We <lb/>searched the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases <lb/>for full-text articles published in English until 11 October <lb/>2023, using the search strategy: (&quot;lavage&quot; or &quot;irrigation&quot; <lb/>or &quot;IRRAflow&quot;) AND (&quot;hemorrhage&quot; or &quot;bleeding&quot; or <lb/>&quot;hemorrhagic stroke&quot;) AND (&quot;intraventricular&quot; or &quot;IVH&quot; <lb/>or &quot;SAH&quot; or &quot;subarachnoid&quot; or &quot;intracerebral&quot; or &quot;ICH&quot;) <lb/>NOT (&quot;subdural&quot; or &quot;CSDH&quot; or &quot;SPECT&quot; or &quot;chronic <lb/>subdural&quot; or &quot;abscess&quot; or &quot;pediatric&quot; or &quot;scalp&quot; or &quot;liver&quot; or <lb/>&quot;infants&quot; or &quot;children&quot; or &quot;child&quot; or &quot;neonatal&quot; or &quot;natal&quot; <lb/>or &quot;preterm&quot;) AND intracranial hemorrhages [MeSH <lb/>Terms], without filters or limits. The search was repeated <lb/>without MeSH Terms, limited to studies published within <lb/>1 year to include the newest research. If the full text was <lb/>inaccessible, the article was requested from the corre-<lb/>sponding author or publisher. <lb/>Eligibility criteria and study selection <lb/>We included studies that evaluated the effect of cisternal <lb/>or intraventricular irrigation therapy in adult patients <lb/>(&gt;18 years) with either SAH or IVH (primary or <lb/>secondary). Studies were excluded if they did not report <lb/>clinical outcomes (mortality, functional outcome, DCI <lb/>or cerebral vasospasm) or technical details of the irriga-<lb/>tion intervention, such as irrigation rate, duration, saline <lb/>solution and catheter placement. We also excluded in <lb/>vitro studies, animal studies, reviews, meta-analyses and <lb/>studies that were unavailable as full text. If the same <lb/>cohort was included in multiple reports, the most recent <lb/>eligible report was included. Articles were managed using <lb/>Covidence. 8 Duplicates were removed. All articles were <lb/>initially assessed for eligibility by one investigator (MGK) <lb/>based on abstract and title. The selected articles were <lb/>then full text screened for eligibility by two investigators <lb/>(MGK, MH). Disagreements were resolved by the prin-<lb/>cipal investigator (ARK). <lb/>Outcomes and data extraction <lb/>We assessed the clinical outcomes mortality, func-<lb/>tional outcome, DCI and cerebral vasospasm. All <lb/>outcomes were dichotomised. A favourable func-<lb/>tional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin <lb/>Scale score of 0-2 (ie, independent in daily living), or <lb/>a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of either 4-5 or &apos;good <lb/>recovery&apos; or &apos;moderate disability&apos;. DCI was defined as <lb/>the appearance of new ischaemic lesions detected on <lb/>CT or MRI at least 48 hours after initial treatment. As <lb/>cerebral vasospasm is an angiographic phenomenon <lb/>that may or may not manifest clinically but is predictive <lb/>of DCI, cerebral vasospasm was defined as either angi-<lb/>ographically verified narrowing of cerebral arteries or <lb/>an increase in mean flow velocity ≥160 cm/s on tran-<lb/>scranial Doppler. If neither of these measures were <lb/>reported, symptomatic vasospasm (neurological dete-<lb/>rioration without other explanation) was considered <lb/>a valid measure for cerebral vasospasm. Data were <lb/>extracted by one investigator (ANRL). <lb/>Intervention subgroups <lb/>To increase homogeneity, the included studies were <lb/>grouped by diagnosis (SAH or IVH). In studies inves-<lb/>tigating SAH, the study populations were further <lb/>grouped into four categories based on the tested <lb/>intervention: (1) conventional treatment, covering <lb/>medical management, standard intensive care and <lb/>in some cases external ventricular drain (see online <lb/>supplemental tables S3 and S4 for details); (2) simple <lb/>cisternal irrigation, with no active substances; (3) <lb/>fibrinolytic cisternal irrigation using either tissue <lb/>plasminogen activator or urokinase; (4) vasodilatory <lb/>cisternal irrigation using calcium channel blockers, <lb/>corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors or <lb/>magnesium sulfate. Furthermore, we included a meta-<lb/>analysis of all studies comparing either fibrinolytic <lb/>irrigation, vasodilatory irrigation or simple irrigation <lb/>to conventional therapy, to assess the overall effect of <lb/>cisternal irrigation. <lb/>Most studies investigated a combination of vasodila-<lb/>tory and fibrinolytic irrigation, thus complicating the <lb/>grouping of the studies. To accommodate this, the <lb/>analysis of fibrinolytic irrigation includes both studies <lb/>using only fibrinolytic irrigation, and studies using <lb/>fibrinolytic irrigation as the primary intervention and <lb/>vasodilatory irrigation as a rescue therapy in patients <lb/>showing signs of cerebral vasospasm. The analysis of <lb/>vasodilatory irrigation includes both studies using <lb/>only vasodilatory irrigation and studies using vasodil-<lb/>atory irrigation and fibrinolytic irrigation simultane-<lb/>ously as preventive therapy. <lb/>Quality assessment <lb/>The evidence quality was assessed using the Grading <lb/>of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and <lb/>Evaluations (GRADE) approach. 9 Detailed GRADE <lb/>guidance was used to assess the overall risk of bias, <lb/>inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publi-<lb/>cation bias of the pooled estimates and reported in <lb/>a summary of findings table. Each individual study <lb/>was assessed for risk of bias with either ROBINS-I <lb/>for observational studies 10 or RoB-2 for randomised <lb/></body>

        <body>studies. 11 Publication bias was investigated by means <lb/>of a visual inspection of the funnel plots for each <lb/>outcome (online supplemental figures S1-S3). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>The meta-analysis was stratified by patient diagnosis <lb/>(IVH or SAH) and the type of irrigation investi-<lb/>gated. Treatment effects were represented by ORs <lb/>and pooled using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects <lb/>model. Results were reported as forest plots with 95% <lb/>CIs. In addition, we pooled prevalence proportions <lb/>of each outcome across all studies, including studies <lb/>with no or non-comparable control groups, to further <lb/>evaluate the effect between intervention groups. The <lb/>statistical significance of differences in prevalence <lb/>between groups was determined based on the 95% <lb/>CIs. All analyses were conducted using RevMan V.5.4 <lb/>software. 12 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Study selection and quality assessment <lb/>We identified 135 studies, and 4 duplicates were removed. <lb/>The remaining 131 studies were screened by title and <lb/>abstract and 60 studies were selected for full-text review. 22 <lb/>articles were excluded due to the unavailability of the full-<lb/>text study. In total, 24 studies were included in the review <lb/>and meta-analysis (figure 1), including 7 randomised <lb/>controlled trials, 14 cohort studies, 2 case reports and <lb/>1 case-control study. The included articles evaluated a <lb/>variety of irrigation interventions for both SAH and IVH <lb/>with differences in irrigation solutions, catheter place-<lb/>ments, irrigation durations and most importantly the <lb/>Figure 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow chart showing the study selection <lb/>process. <lb/></body>

        <body>presence of active substances in the irrigation fluid (see <lb/>online supplemental table S4 for details). The GRADE <lb/>summary findings for selected outcomes and interven-<lb/>tions are shown in table 1 and online supplemental table <lb/>S5 and the risk of bias of the included studies can be <lb/>found in online supplemental tables S6 and S7. Based on <lb/>visual inspection of funnel plots, the risk of publication <lb/>bias was low for all comparisons (online supplemental <lb/>figures S5-S7). <lb/>Irrigation therapy in SAH <lb/>A total of 22 studies evaluated irrigation treatments for <lb/>SAH, including intraoperative and postoperative methods. <lb/>Intraoperative irrigation (5 of 22 studies) was conducted <lb/>to blood collections in the subarachnoid space through <lb/>the open cisternal access after clipping the aneurysm. <lb/>Irrigation duration was approximately 30 min. Methods <lb/>for postoperative irrigation (16 of 22 studies) included <lb/>continuous saline infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid <lb/>compartment through a ventricular or cisternal catheter <lb/>and simultaneous drainage through a second ventricular <lb/>or cisternal catheter. The duration of irrigation and irri-<lb/>gation rate were reported with substantial inconsistency <lb/>across studies. The duration ranged between 2 and 18 days <lb/>and the irrigation rate ranged between 20 and 180 mL/ <lb/>hour for postoperative irrigation. A detailed description <lb/>of intervention methods can be found in online supple-<lb/>mental table S4. <lb/>Overall cisternal irrigation in SAH <lb/>The mean mortality rate in patients treated with conven-<lb/>tional therapy was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.23) 13-22 (online <lb/>supplemental figure S4).

        <body>(HR: 4.4, 95% CI 0.6 to 31.2, p=0.14). They did not <lb/>find any statistically significant difference in mortality <lb/>or functional outcome between the intervention and <lb/>control group. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In this review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the existing <lb/>evidence on cisternal irrigation treatment for SAH <lb/>and IVH. Concerning irrigation treatment in SAH, we <lb/>found that fibrinolytic irrigation significantly reduced <lb/>the mortality rate and improved functional outcome <lb/>compared with conventional treatment. These findings <lb/>could be mediated by the reduced risks of radiographic <lb/>DCI and cerebral vasospasm. Our meta-analysis showed <lb/>that vasodilatory irrigation also resulted in a significant <lb/>reduction in mortality and a reduced risk of cerebral <lb/>vasospasm in SAH patients, compared with no vasodi-<lb/>latory irrigation. However, the analyses did not support <lb/>improvements in functional outcome or the rate of DCI <lb/>in patients for this intervention. The evidence on irriga-<lb/>tion in patients with IVH was very limited and one study <lb/>raised safety concerns with the methodology, although <lb/>the majority of adverse events were related to design <lb/>features of the irrigation technology. 36 While another <lb/>study pointed to beneficial outcomes in IVH patients <lb/>treated with irrigation, it is important to consider the <lb/>safety of the methods and technology used and thus the <lb/>potential of the treatment remains unclarified. <lb/>When comparing any kind of cisternal irrigation to <lb/>conventional therapy in SAH, our meta-analysis showed <lb/>significant positive results for all outcomes. However, due <lb/>to the sparse and heterogenic evidence of both vasodil-<lb/>atory irrigation and irrigation with only electrolyte solu-<lb/>tion, these results may be driven primarily by the effects <lb/>of fibrinolytic irrigation. <lb/>Obstructive hydrocephalus, DCI and cerebral vaso-<lb/>spasm are major contributors to the high morbidity and <lb/>mortality in patients with SAH and IVH and are caused in <lb/>part by blood coagulation and blood degradation prod-<lb/>ucts. 4 Fibrinolytic irrigation represents a rational treat-<lb/>ment option that could prevent secondary injuries by <lb/>accelerating clot clearance and washing out blood degra-<lb/>dation products. 39 40 <lb/>Despite promising indications, the current evidence on <lb/>irrigation therapy for SAH and IVH is sparse, and most <lb/>of the existing studies are observational retrospective <lb/>studies or case reports. While some studies included in <lb/>this systematic review and meta-analysis found no statisti-<lb/>cally significant difference between treatments, none of <lb/>the included studies reported worse outcomes in patients <lb/>treated with irrigation therapy compared with no irriga-<lb/>tion, suggesting that irrigation therapy overall is safe and <lb/>feasible; however, we did not investigate safety outcomes <lb/>in this study. To conclusively verify the effect of fibrino-<lb/>lytic or vasodilatory cisternal irrigation, it seems justified <lb/>to perform a large, randomised trial. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>There was substantial heterogeneity in the surgical <lb/>methodologies and irrigation interventions used in the <lb/>included studies, which complicated study stratification. A <lb/>high heterogeneity score is expected with the number of <lb/>observational studies included, however, pooling studies <lb/>may have resulted in substantial increase in heteroge-<lb/>neity, since including different combinations of fibrino-<lb/>lytic irrigation and vasodilatory irrigation treatment may <lb/>be a significant driver for the high heterogeneity. Further-<lb/>more, the evidence quality was compromised for some <lb/>outcomes, due to sparse literature, inclusion of obser-<lb/>vational studies without control groups, and substantial <lb/>variations in the time points of outcome registration. <lb/>For IVH, the evidence quality was compromised by few <lb/>studies and low sample size. Finally, the funnel plots did <lb/>not raise concern regarding publication bias, however, <lb/>publication bias could result in non-publication of data <lb/>showing neutral or negative results of irrigation therapy <lb/>and cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the results for vasodil-<lb/>atory cisternal irrigation compared with other treatments <lb/>revealed a discrepancy between randomised controlled <lb/>trial and observational studies. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>Cisternal irrigation may be associated with improved <lb/>prognosis in patients with SAH when compared with <lb/>conventional therapy. Fibrinolytic irrigation reduced <lb/>mortality and improved functional outcome; effects that <lb/>were also reflected in reduced risks of DCI and cerebral <lb/>vasospasm. Vasodilatory cisternal irrigation may be a safe <lb/>and feasible treatment for cerebral vasospasm; however, <lb/>the current evidence is sparse, and future randomised <lb/>studies are required to assess the treatment efficacy. <lb/>We found no evidence to support irrigation therapy in <lb/>patients with IVH. <lb/></body>
