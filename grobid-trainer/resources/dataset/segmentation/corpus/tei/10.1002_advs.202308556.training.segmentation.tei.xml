Accurate diagnosis through imaging and a multi-<lb/>disciplinary approach is essential for timely surgical management, preventing <lb/>complications, and ensuring better patient outcomes. <lb/>Abstract <lb/>The multiplication of the gallbladder is a congenital malformation with a rare <lb/>incidence of 1 in 4000 patients, among which the trifoliate gallbladder, even rarer, <lb/>is included. Gallbladder anomalies are typically discovered incidentally while in-<lb/>vestigating conditions like gallstones, sedimentation, gallbladder inflammation, <lb/>or malignancy. The clinical presentation of trifoliate gallbladder disease varies, <lb/>and it may require a variety of imaging modalities to obtain a preoperative di-<lb/>agnosis. Recommended therapeutics for this anomaly are open or laparoscopic <lb/>cholecystectomy, depending on the patient&apos;s condition. Early diagnosis of gall-<lb/>bladder multiplications is vital to improve prognosis and mitigate the risk of <lb/>complications like cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, metaplasia, and adenocarcinoma. <lb/>In our case, we present a 30-year-old male with the diagnosis of acute cholecys-<lb/>titis with triple gallbladder. A confirmatory diagnosis was made with magnetic <lb/>resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The patient responded well to the <lb/>therapy given and was discharged for follow-up. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>acute cholecystitis, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), maximum <lb/>intensity projection (MIP), open cholecystectomy, trifoliate gallbladder <lb/></front>

            <body>triple gallbladder have been identified, among which du-<lb/>plications and triplications are rare. 3 Clinical evaluation <lb/>is often insufficient, as, despite a thorough workup, the <lb/>diagnosis can be confused with choledocholithiasis, as-<lb/>cending cholangitis, biloma, or carcinoma. 3 Therefore, a <lb/>confirmatory histopathological examination is necessary. <lb/>However, radiological evaluation is thus essential to rule <lb/>out the triple gallbladder and rule out type II choledochal <lb/>cysts and other congenital anomalies. The use of a single <lb/>imaging modality has low sensitivity for diagnosing triple <lb/>gallbladder; hence, the use of multiple modalities, such <lb/>as ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea-<lb/>tography (MRCP), is warranted when combined with an <lb/>intraoperative cholangiogram to prevent damage to the <lb/>biliary tree. 4-6 For symptomatic multiple gallbladders, a <lb/>cholecystectomy is advised to prevent recurrence; open <lb/>surgery is preferred due to anatomical differences, and in-<lb/>traoperative cholangiography is recommended with lap-<lb/>aroscopic methods. 4,7 We present a case of a 30-year-old <lb/>man who experienced symptoms of acute cholecysti-<lb/>tis and, later on, was diagnosed with trifoliate type 3 on <lb/>MRCP. The patient responded well to the treatment given <lb/>and was discharged for follow-up. <lb/>2 | CASE PRESENTATION <lb/>We present a case of a 30-year-old male who presented to <lb/>the surgery outpatient department (OPD) with a history <lb/>of intermittent, colicky abdominal pain, food intolerance, <lb/>bloating, nausea, and vomiting for the past 3 days. No sig-<lb/>nificant past medical history was found. <lb/>On physical examination, there was tenderness in the <lb/>right hypochondrium and a positive Murphy&apos;s sign on deep <lb/>palpation. No rigidity or rebound tenderness could be elic-<lb/>ited. The rest of the systemic examination findings were <lb/>unremarkable. Leukocytosis was found in the complete <lb/>blood count (CBC), and the biochemistry panel showed <lb/>high levels of transaminases, such as alanine transami-<lb/>nase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. <lb/>Additionally, the total bilirubin level was measured at <lb/>0.9 mg/dL, while amylase and lipase levels were recorded <lb/>at 40 and 22 U/L, respectively, as shown in Table 1. <lb/>Further evaluation with abdominal ultrasound showed <lb/>the presence of three anechoic, fluid-filled saccular struc-<lb/>tures in the expected location of the GB fossa, as shown <lb/>in Figure 1. <lb/>One of the structures showed a shadowing echogenic <lb/>focus measuring approximately 4 mm in maximum di-<lb/>mension, consistent with cholelithiasis, as shown in <lb/>Figure 2. Mild wall thickening was seen in all three struc-<lb/>tures. The possibility of either a Todani type II choledo-<lb/>chal cyst or a duplicated gallbladder was postulated based <lb/>on sonographic findings, and magnetic resonance cholan-<lb/>giopancreatography (MRCP) was advised. <lb/>MRCP showed the presence of three incompletely sep-<lb/>arated tubular cystic structures in the region of the gall-<lb/>bladder fossa with incomplete septations, as shown in <lb/>Figure 3. <lb/>The structures were seen to confluence at the region <lb/>of the neck of the gallbladder with a solitary cystic duct, <lb/>which was further confirmed through a maximum in-<lb/>tensity projection (MIP) image displayed in Figure 4. <lb/>The findings were consistent with trifoliate gallbladder <lb/>type 3. <lb/>Following appropriate informed consent, the patient <lb/>was taken for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat the <lb/>calculous cholecystitis. Laparoscopic examination showed <lb/>that the gallbladder lumen was split into three parts, with <lb/>a single cystic duct and an accompanying artery. The surgi-<lb/>cal specimen was sent for histopathological examination, <lb/>which revealed slightly edematous mucosa in two of the <lb/>three gallbladders and slightly edematous, inflammatory <lb/>changes in the mucosa of the third with accompanying <lb/>calculus. No signs of chronic inflammation, metaplasia, <lb/>or carcinomatous changes were noted in any of the three <lb/>gallbladders, as shown in Figure 5. Post-operative recov-<lb/>ery was uneventful. The patient continues to be pain-free <lb/>and in good health. <lb/>3 | DISCUSSION <lb/>Congenital anomalous biliary multiplications, such as <lb/>triple gallbladder (vesical fellae triplex), are exceedingly <lb/>rare occurrences, with an incidence of approximately 1 in <lb/>4000 patients. 4 These anomalies result from the incom-<lb/>plete regression of embryological rudimentary bile ducts <lb/>and can manifest in various configurations, leading to dif-<lb/>ferent types of triple gallbladders. 8 The classification of <lb/>these anomalies is primarily based on the size, location, <lb/>and number of accessory gallbladders.

			<body>have been described, each characterized by distinct biliary <lb/>drainage configurations, as shown in Table 2. 8 <lb/>Type 1 triple gallbladder is characterized by three sep-<lb/>arate gallbladders, each with its own cystic duct, while in <lb/>Type 2, two gallbladders connect to a common cystic duct, <lb/>and the third drains into a separate duct. Type 3 involves <lb/>three gallbladders sharing a single cystic duct. 8 These vari-<lb/>ations in anatomy are essential to understand when diag-<lb/>nosing and managing congenital biliary multiplications, <lb/>as they influence clinical presentation and treatment <lb/>approaches. <lb/>The clinical presentation of the triple gallbladder can <lb/>vary widely, and it often mimics more common biliary <lb/>pathologies, such as calculous or acalculous cholecystitis, <lb/>ascending cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, or even bi-<lb/>loma and biliary hematoma. 4 Therefore, clinicians must <lb/>consider this rare anomaly in the differential diagnosis, <lb/>especially when patients present with atypical symptoms <lb/>or complications related to the biliary system. <lb/>Radiological imaging plays a vital role in the diag-<lb/>nosis of triple gallbladder and other congenital biliary <lb/>anomalies. Multiple imaging modalities, including ultra-<lb/>sound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography <lb/>(ERCP), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatog-<lb/>raphy (MRCP), are often required to accurately delineate <lb/>the anatomy and confirm the diagnosis. 9 However, it is <lb/>important to note that even with meticulous imaging pro-<lb/>tocols, the detection of the triple gallbladder can be chal-<lb/>lenging due to the rarity of the condition and the potential <lb/>for radiologists to focus on more common differentials. 9 <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Oblique sagittal sonography image showing three <lb/>anechoic, cystic, and saccular structures in the GB fossa (blue arrows). <lb/>F I G U R E 2 Oblique sagittal sonography image showing <lb/>calculus at the neck of the GB (red arrow) and mild wall thickening <lb/>(blue arrow). <lb/>F I G U R E 3 Coronal multi-planar reformat showing three <lb/>gallbladders with incomplete septations (white arrows). <lb/>F I G U R E 4 Coronal MIP image showing a single cystic duct <lb/>(blue arrows) joining the CBD. <lb/>F I G U R E 5 HPE image with hematoxylin-eosin stain showing <lb/>fibrinous, inflammatory exudates, and neutrophil infiltration into <lb/>the gallbladder mucosa, consistent with acute cholecystitis. <lb/></body>

            <body>Early diagnosis is crucial for a better prognosis and <lb/>to reduce the risk of intraoperative and pathological <lb/>complications associated with gallbladder multiplica-<lb/>tions, such as cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, metaplasia, <lb/>and adenocarcinoma. 2 Surgical management is the <lb/>primary treatment approach, typically involving lap-<lb/>aroscopic cholecystectomy with careful dissection of <lb/>Calot&apos;s triangle. An intraoperative cholangiogram is <lb/>recommended to avoid damage to the biliary tree during <lb/>the procedure. 7 Furthermore, a thorough histopatholog-<lb/>ical examination of the resected specimen is essential <lb/>to assess for underlying pathologies, including chronic <lb/>cholecystitis and metaplasia, which may impact clinical <lb/>outcomes. 8 <lb/>In conclusion, triple gallbladder and other congenital <lb/>biliary multiplications are rare anomalies that can pres-<lb/>ent with variable clinical symptoms and often mimic more <lb/>common biliary pathologies. Radiological imaging is in-<lb/>strumental in their diagnosis, although the rarity of these <lb/>anomalies and the presence of other differential diagnoses <lb/>can pose challenges to detection. Early diagnosis and ap-<lb/>propriate surgical management are crucial for improving <lb/>patient outcomes and reducing complications associated <lb/>with these anomalies. A multidisciplinary approach in-<lb/>volving clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists is essen-<lb/>tial for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment of these <lb/>rare biliary anomalies. 3 <lb/>4 | CONCLUSION <lb/>We present a novel case of triple gallbladder, an exceed-<lb/>ingly rare anatomical variation within the biliary system. <lb/>In the context of abdominal imaging, where more com-<lb/>mon radiological differential diagnoses like biloma or <lb/>a type II choledochal cyst often take precedence, a high <lb/>index of clinical suspicion and heightened awareness on <lb/>the part of the radiologist become paramount. These fac-<lb/>tors are instrumental in ensuring the accurate diagnosis of <lb/>this exceptionally rare anomaly, allowing for timely and <lb/>appropriate medical management. <lb/></body>
