Hsiao <lb/>Received: April 3, 2024 / Accepted: June 4, 2024 / Published online: June 22, 2024 <lb/>© The Author(s) 2024 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Introduction: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) <lb/>is a frequently debilitating, inflammatory skin <lb/>condition. Patients may have a limited response <lb/>to adalimumab, currently the only Food and <lb/>Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biologic <lb/>treatment for HS. Ustekinumab is an interleu-<lb/>kin-12/23 inhibitor that has been utilized in <lb/>HS, but there is a lack of an updated system-<lb/>atic review on its efficacy and safety. The aim of <lb/>this study is to perform a systematic review and <lb/>meta-analysis of the literature on the efficacy <lb/>and safety of ustekinumab for HS. <lb/>Methods: In October 2022, MEDLINE and <lb/>Embase databases were searched for articles <lb/>on ustekinumab in HS. Data extraction was <lb/>performed on relevant articles by two review-<lb/>ers. The primary study outcome was the pooled <lb/>response rate of HS to ustekinumab. A fixed-<lb/>effects meta-analysis was performed, and <lb/>Cochran&apos;s Q statistic and I squared index were <lb/>used to assess heterogeneity. Statistical signifi-<lb/>cance was determined at p &lt; 0.05. This article <lb/>is based on previously conducted studies and <lb/>does not contain any new studies with human <lb/>participants or animals performed by any of the <lb/>authors. <lb/>Results: From 2012 to 2022, ten articles (nine <lb/>case series and one prospective trial) with 88 <lb/>patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients with <lb/>reported disease severity had Hurley stage II <lb/>(17.6%, 12/68) or III (82.4%, 56/68) disease. The <lb/>majority (80.7%, 71/88) had previously failed at <lb/>least one biologic treatment. A meta-analysis of <lb/>R.

        <front>Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2024) 14:1901-1916 <lb/>all ten studies showed a pooled response rate <lb/>of 67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76).

The majority of patients had previously <lb/>failed treatment with one or more biologic <lb/>agents. <lb/>Our study demonstrates the potential efficacy <lb/>of ustekinumab as a secondary or tertiary <lb/>treatment option for HS. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, <lb/>oftentimes debilitating skin condition that pre-<lb/>sents with abscesses, nodules, sinus tracts, and <lb/>scarring, typically in intertriginous areas [1]. <lb/>The pathogenesis of HS is complex and encom-<lb/>passes genetic [2], epigenetic [3], immunologi-<lb/>cal, hormonal, and environmental factors [4]. <lb/>Though many medical and procedural thera-<lb/>pies are used to treat the disease, the condition <lb/>is often recalcitrant to treatment [5]. Despite <lb/>recent advances in treatments for HS, there is a <lb/>substantial unmet need for effective therapeutic <lb/>solutions [6]. Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis fac-<lb/>tor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor, and secukinumab, an <lb/>interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitor, are currently the <lb/>only FDA-approved biologic agents for the treat-<lb/>ment of HS. However, some patients may not <lb/>have an adequate or durable response to TNF-<lb/>alpha or IL-17 inhibitors [7]. Ustekinumab is an <lb/>IL-12 and IL-23 inhibitor that has been utilized <lb/>in patients with HS, but there is a paucity of <lb/>data on its efficacy and safety for this disease <lb/>[8]. The aim of this study is to systematically <lb/>evaluate existing literature on the efficacy and <lb/>safety of ustekinumab treatment in HS and con-<lb/>duct a meta-analysis. This information will be <lb/>useful for clinicians as they counsel patients <lb/>with HS, particularly those who have inade-<lb/>quate responses to previous biologic treatments, <lb/>regarding treatment with ustekinumab. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Search Strategy <lb/>This study was performed using the Pre-<lb/>ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews <lb/>and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines <lb/>(Fig. 1) and was preregistered on PROSPERO <lb/>(CRD42022364634). On 5 October 2022, two <lb/>independent reviewers (R.M. and J.S.) searched <lb/>MEDLINE and Embase databases from incep-<lb/>tion to start date with the following terms: <lb/>(&quot;hidradenitis suppurativa&quot; OR &quot;hidradeni-<lb/>tis&quot; OR &quot;acne inversa&quot; OR &quot;velpeau disease&quot; <lb/>OR &quot;verneuil disease&quot;) AND (&quot;ustekinumab&quot;). <lb/>A total of 361 articles were identified. Articles <lb/>were filtered to remove non-English-language <lb/>and nonhuman studies. Duplicate articles were <lb/>excluded, and the titles and abstracts of the <lb/>remaining articles were screened for relevance. <lb/>Full-text review was then performed on the <lb/>remaining 112 articles by the two independent <lb/>reviewers (R.M. and J.S.). Studies that described <lb/>ustekinumab as the primary intervention for <lb/>HS, contained outcome efficacy data, and had <lb/>three or more patients were considered eligible <lb/>for inclusion.

        <body>articles were excluded. Any discrepancies were <lb/>discussed to consensus with a third reviewer <lb/>(J.L.H.). Reference lists of articles that met the <lb/>inclusion criteria were screened for additional <lb/>relevant articles, and none were identified. <lb/>This article is based on previously conducted <lb/>studies and does not contain any new studies <lb/>with human participants or animals performed <lb/>by any of the authors. The databases used in this <lb/>study are publicly available: MEDLINE: https:// <lb/>pubmed. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ and Embase: https:// <lb/>www. embase. com/ search/ quick. <lb/>Data Extraction <lb/>Two reviewers (R.M. and J.S.) independently <lb/>completed data extraction. Each article was <lb/>reviewed, and the following information was <lb/>collected: study design, country of study, patient <lb/>characteristics, HS severity, regions of the body <lb/>affected by HS, previously failed treatments, <lb/>concomitant treatments, inflammatory comor-<lb/>bidities, study intervention, duration of treat-<lb/>ment/timepoint of efficacy measurement, treat-<lb/>ment response, and adverse effects. <lb/>Meta-analysis <lb/>A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the <lb/>pooled estimated response rate of HS to usteki-<lb/>numab. To determine response, predetermined <lb/>primary clinician reported outcome measures <lb/>were used whenever available, followed by phy-<lb/>sician assessments; the HS Clinical Response <lb/>(HiSCR) was prioritized if different clinician <lb/>reported outcome measures were available. For-<lb/>est plots were constructed using the proportion <lb/>of patients with a reported response (including <lb/>partial response) to ustekinumab, and standard <lb/>errors/confidence intervals were computed using <lb/>inverse variance weighting (Fig. 2). Cochran&apos;s <lb/>Q statistic and I squared index (the percentage <lb/>of variation across studies that is due to hetero-<lb/>geneity rather than chance) were used to assess <lb/>heterogeneity. Because significant heterogeneity <lb/>was not observed, a fixed-effects meta-analyti-<lb/>cal model was utilized as opposed to a random-<lb/>effects pooled estimate. Statistical analyses were <lb/>performed using R version 4.1.0 (www.r-proje ct. <lb/>org). p-Values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically <lb/>significant. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Ten articles published between 2012 and 2022 <lb/>met inclusion criteria. There were 88 patients <lb/>across nine case series and one prospective <lb/>trial. Study locations included Spain (n = 5), <lb/>USA (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1), Denmark <lb/>(n = 1), Ireland (n = 1), and Germany (n = 1). <lb/>Study characteristics, patient characteristics, <lb/>treatment regimens, previous treatments, <lb/>Fig. 2 Forest plot of fixed effects meta-analysis among hidradenitis suppurativa patients treated with ustekinumab <lb/></body>

        <body>concomitant treatments, inflammatory comor-<lb/>bidities, responses to treatment, adverse events, <lb/>and study quality are summarized in Table 1. In <lb/>terms of study quality, the prospective trial had <lb/>a high risk of bias. <lb/>Across all studies, patient age ranged from <lb/>20 to 70 years. The mean age of patients was <lb/>reported in one prospective trial and two case <lb/>series as 35, 37, and 53.2 years [9-11], respec-<lb/>tively. Of the eight studies that included gen-<lb/>der data, 64.8% (46/71) of patients were female. <lb/>HS severity was reported as Hurley stage in 68 <lb/>patients across eight studies, and the majority <lb/>of patients had Hurley stage III disease (82.4%, <lb/>56/68) followed by stage II (17.6%, 12/68). Pre-<lb/>viously failed treatments were described in all <lb/>studies and included topical resorcinol, topical <lb/>or systemic antibiotics, steroids (topical, sys-<lb/>temic, or intralesional), adalimumab, infliximab, <lb/>certolizumab, etanercept, anakinra, efalizumab, <lb/>methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, sul-<lb/>fasalazine, oral retinoids, dapsone, liraglutide, <lb/>metformin, spironolactone, finasteride, inter-<lb/>feron, intense pulsed light plus epilation, pho-<lb/>totherapy, deroofing, incision and drainage, and <lb/>surgery. The majority (80.7%, 71/88) of patients <lb/>had previously failed at least one biologic treat-<lb/>ment. Nearly three-fourths (71.6%, 63/88) had <lb/>failed adalimumab, and more than one-third <lb/>(36.4%, 32/88) had failed infliximab. Comor-<lb/>bidities were reported in 73 patients across six <lb/>studies; 23.3% (17/73) had Crohn&apos;s disease or <lb/>ulcerative colitis, and 9.6% (7/73) had psoriasis. <lb/>Concomitant treatments reported in four studies <lb/>include topical resorcinol, systemic and intral-<lb/>esional steroids, incision and drainage, oral anti-<lb/>biotics, oral retinoids, deroofing, and surgery. <lb/>Dosing of ustekinumab was 90 mg (mg) <lb/>in four studies, 45 or 90 mg in three studies, <lb/>45 mg in one study, and unspecified in two stud-<lb/>ies. Across eight studies, the frequency of the <lb/>ustekinumab maintenance dosage ranged from <lb/>every 4 to 12 weeks. The initial loading dose <lb/>was delivered intravenously in four studies and <lb/>subcutaneously in three studies. The timepoints <lb/>for efficacy measurement ranged from 8 weeks <lb/>to 18 months across all ten studies. Clinician-<lb/>reported outcome measures used for meta-anal-<lb/>ysis of the pooled response rate included HiSCR <lb/>(n = 4), physician assessment (n = 4), HS-Physician <lb/>Global Assessment (n = 1), and International HS <lb/>Severity Score System (IHS4) (n = 1). The over-<lb/>all response rate for weight-based intravenous <lb/>(IV) loading dose followed by 90 mg every <lb/>8-12 weeks subcutaneously (SC) was 65.4% <lb/>(17/26); the response rate for SC loading dose <lb/>followed by doses ranging from 45 to 90 mg <lb/>every 8-12 weeks was 56.7% (17/30). <lb/>On the basis of the meta-analysis of the ten <lb/>included studies, the pooled response rate of <lb/>patients with HS responding to ustekinumab was <lb/>67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76). Nonsignificant hetero-<lb/>geneity was observed between studies (I 2 = 0%, <lb/>p = 0.73) (Fig. 2). Eight out of ten studies reported <lb/>a response rate greater than 50%. Adverse events <lb/>were reported in 4.5% (4/88) of patients across <lb/>studies. These included headache, fatigue, upper <lb/>respiratory infection, urticaria, cystitis, psoriasi-<lb/>form dermatitis, arthritis, bacterial axillary infec-<lb/>tion, and recurrent infections. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Our study found that ustekinumab may be an <lb/>effective and safe treatment option for patients <lb/>with recalcitrant, moderate-severe HS. The <lb/>fixed-effects meta-analysis showed a pooled <lb/>response rate of 67%, and over 80% of the <lb/>patients had previously failed at least one other <lb/>biologic agent. Adverse events were reported in <lb/>only 4.5% of patients with HS on ustekinumab <lb/>treatment. <lb/>Although the exact pathophysiology of HS <lb/>remains unclear, chronic upregulation of inflam-<lb/>matory cytokines is believed to play a vital role <lb/>in the initiation and propagation of the disease. <lb/>Disproportionately high levels of IL-12 and <lb/>IL-23 have been found in HS lesions, suggest-<lb/>ing potential benefits from biologic agents that <lb/>block these cytokines and reduce the down-<lb/>stream maturation of IL-17-producing T-helper <lb/>cells [12]. <lb/>The optimal dosing regimen for ustekinumab <lb/>in patients with HS has not yet been established. <lb/>Jiang et al.&apos;s 2022 study demonstrated that high-<lb/>dose, high-frequency ustekinumab may be effec-<lb/>tive in reducing IHS4 and pain scores in patients <lb/>with HS, but the study was limited by a small <lb/></body>

        <body>sample size of six patients [11]. In a 2021 system-<lb/>atic review and meta-analysis by Meserve et al., <lb/>increasing the frequency of doses to every 4 or <lb/>6 weeks instead of 8 weeks, and/or intravenous <lb/>reinduction, led to a clinical response in 55% <lb/>of 925 patients with Crohn&apos;s disease who previ-<lb/>ously had an inadequate response to the stand-<lb/>ard ustekinumab dosing regimen [13]. Increas-<lb/>ing the ustekinumab dosing frequency from <lb/>every 12 weeks to 8 weeks has also been reported <lb/>to be beneficial in patients with psoriasis [14]. <lb/>More investigation is needed to understand the <lb/>potential advantages of dose intensification in <lb/>patients with HS who are initially nonrespond-<lb/>ers or partial responders to ustekinumab treat-<lb/>ment. Use of ultrasonographic characteristics, <lb/>such as vascularization and fibrosis [15], may <lb/>also be considered in the future as adjunct tools <lb/>to monitor responses to treatment. <lb/>In addition, it is currently unclear whether <lb/>the IV loading dose for HS has benefits over an <lb/>initial SC loading dose. One study found that <lb/>ustekinumab trough levels and clinical outcomes <lb/>were comparable in 17 patients with Crohn&apos;s <lb/>disease who completed SC induction com-<lb/>pared with 249 patients with Crohn&apos;s disease <lb/>who received intravenous induction in another <lb/>clinical trial [16]. At this time, SC induction of <lb/>ustekinumab may be an appropriate treatment <lb/>consideration for patients who have personal, <lb/>financial, or logistical barriers to accessing an <lb/>infusion center for intravenous induction dos-<lb/>ing, but further studies are needed. <lb/>There is a paucity of data on the develop-<lb/>ment of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and thera-<lb/>peutic drug level monitoring for ustekinumab <lb/>in HS. Tsakok et al.&apos;s prospective cohort study <lb/>of 491 patients with psoriasis treated with <lb/>ustekinumab found that ADAs were detected <lb/>in 3.5% of patients. Higher serum ustekinumab <lb/>levels during early treatment were associated <lb/>with better clinical responses after 6 months <lb/>of treatment, suggesting that appropriate drug <lb/>levels during the initial phases of treatment <lb/>may be important for future clinical outcomes <lb/>[17]. A 2014 systematic review by Hsu et al. <lb/>reported that ADAs were detected in 3.8-6% <lb/>of patients treated with ustekinumab for pso-<lb/>riasis compared with 5.4-43.6% of patients on <lb/>infliximab, 0-18.3% on etanercept, and 6-45% <lb/>on adalimumab [18]. While these results indi-<lb/>cate that ustekinumab may not have as high a <lb/>risk of ADA development as TNF inhibitors that <lb/>are commonly used in HS such as adalimumab <lb/>and infliximab, a more comprehensive under-<lb/>standing of ustekinumab&apos;s immunogenicity <lb/>and optimal serum trough levels could guide <lb/>clinicians in cases of partial or nondurable <lb/>response to ustekinumab. <lb/>This study contributes to the literature by <lb/>providing an updated systematic review as <lb/>well as a pooled response rate on ustekinumab <lb/>use in HS, which supports the use of usteki-<lb/>numab in recalcitrant cases of HS. A 2020 <lb/>systematic review of ustekinumab in HS by <lb/>Montero-Vilchez et al. found that 78% of 49 <lb/>patients exhibited a response [8], though of <lb/>note, case reports were included in this study, <lb/>which could skew results towards a more <lb/>favorable response rate. Further support for <lb/>ustekinumab in HS treatment is seen in recent <lb/>drug survival studies. Ring and colleagues <lb/>found that, in a nationwide cohort study of <lb/>patients with HS, drug survival was comparable <lb/>between ustekinumab, adalimumab, and inf-<lb/>liximab; the median time to discontinuation <lb/>for ustekinumab was 26 months [19]. Larger <lb/>studies on the drug survival of ustekinumab in <lb/>patients with HS may shed further insight on <lb/>its real-world clinical efficacy. We also found <lb/>that adverse effects were mild and infrequent <lb/>among patients with HS treated with usteki-<lb/>numab and in line with the known side-effect <lb/>profile of ustekinumab [20]. A retrospective <lb/>cohort study of 21,821 patients with inflam-<lb/>matory bowel disease found that ustekinumab <lb/>was associated with a decreased risk of infec-<lb/>tions compared with TNF-alpha inhibitors <lb/>[21]. These safety findings may be a potential <lb/>advantage for ustekinumab as a less immuno-<lb/>suppressive agent compared with TNF-alpha <lb/>inhibitors. <lb/>Study limitations, shared by most system-<lb/>atic reviews on HS treatments, include an <lb/>overall small number of studies and patients. <lb/>All studies took place in the USA or Europe, <lb/>limiting generalizability. Given the small num-<lb/>ber of patients, we were unable to differenti-<lb/>ate the response rates of patients on the basis <lb/>of inflammatory comorbidities or previously <lb/></body>

        <body>failed treatments. Another limitation is the <lb/>risk of reporting bias with the inclusion of case <lb/>series. Lastly, studies had variable dosing regi-<lb/>mens, outcome measures, and timepoints for <lb/>efficacy measurements. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Overall, ustekinumab may be a helpful biologic <lb/>to consider for patients with recalcitrant HS who <lb/>have failed first-line biologic therapies such as <lb/>TNF-alpha or IL-17 inhibitors that have robust <lb/>phase III trial data and, for adalimumab, post-<lb/>marketing data as well. Large randomized con-<lb/>trolled trials are needed to better understand the <lb/>efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing regimen of <lb/>ustekinumab in HS. Future investigations should <lb/>evaluate the benefits of concomitant treatment <lb/>with ustekinumab and other HS treatments. <lb/>Studies that investigate patient characteristics <lb/>that may predict therapeutic responses, drug sur-<lb/>vival rates, and the potential use of therapeutic <lb/>drug monitoring are also warranted. <lb/></body>
