        <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Making comparisons is a common function of human languages, and this is not <lb/>different in Mandarin Chinese. There are two types of comparative clauses in <lb/>Mandarin: (i) superiority comparatives, which are mainly marked by比 bi &apos;than&apos;, and <lb/>(ii) equality comparatives marked by 跟 gen &apos;with&apos; (and its variants 像 xiang, 如 ru, <lb/>and 又 you) (see Paris and Shi 2016: 297). 1 Our focus in the present paper lies with the <lb/>superiority comparatives, which typically take the following shape: [bi N(oun) (hai) <lb/>A(djective)] as illustrated in (1): <lb/>(1) <lb/>橡树的叶子比手掌还大。 <lb/>Xiangshu de <lb/>yezi <lb/>bi <lb/>shouzhang <lb/>Oak.tree GEN leaf <lb/>BI <lb/>palm <lb/>COMPAREE COMPARATIVE STANDARD <lb/>MARKER <lb/>OF COMPARISON <lb/>hai <lb/>da. <lb/>HAI <lb/>big <lb/>DEGREE <lb/>DIMENSION <lb/>ADVERB <lb/>OF COMPARISON <lb/>&apos;The leaves of oak trees are even bigger than the palm of a hand.&apos; 2 <lb/>In this [bi N hai A] construction, an entity (橡树的叶子 xiangshu de yezi &apos;the leaves of <lb/>oak trees&apos;) is compared to another entity (the standard of comparison, encoded by the <lb/>noun 手掌 shouzhang &apos;palm (of a hand)&apos;) with respect to a particular dimension (here <lb/>encoded by the adjective 大 da &apos;big&apos;), 3 which can be thought of as scale without <lb/>absolute values (see Quirk et al. 1985: 1129). The degree adverb 还 hai &apos;still&apos; is <lb/>optional: 4 in (1), it conveys the presupposition that the palm of a hand is big, the <lb/>main assertion being that the leaves of oak trees are even bigger; without hai, <lb/>the comparative construction [bi N A] simply asserts that there is a difference in size <lb/>between the leaves of oak trees and the palm of a hand. <lb/>In Mandarin, there are two unconventional noun comparative constructions: <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ]. They are unconventional in that the dimension of <lb/>comparison is expressed by a noun rather than an adjective. In the former type, this <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">1 Inferiority, then, is expressed by adding negative markers to the superiority or equality <lb/>comparatives. <lb/>2 The terms &apos;standard of comparison&apos; and &apos;dimension of comparison&apos; are taken from Paris and Shi <lb/>(2016: 297) and Li and Thompson (1981: 564). The part-of-speech category of the comparative markers <lb/>bi and gen (and variants) is &apos;prepositions&apos; (see Paris and Shi 2016: 297). <lb/>3 As Paris and Shi (2016: 300-301) point out, the scalar requirement can also be met by a predicate <lb/>that has a direction scale (e.g., shangyang &apos;go up&apos;) or that expresses a continuous event (e.g., &apos;get thin&apos;). <lb/>4 A variant of the degree adverb hai is geng (see also Section 2.2). <lb/></note>

        <body>noun is formally identical to the noun expressing the standard of comparison; in the <lb/>latter, the nouns are formally different. Another idiosyncrasy of this construction lies <lb/>in that the nouns sanctioned in this construction can only take the form of bare <lb/>nouns and they cannot be modified by adjectives, classifiers, or demonstratives. <lb/>Semantically, the nouns in the two constructions are different as well: while the first <lb/>noun -expressing the standard of comparison -denotes an entity, the second noun -<lb/>expressing the dimension of comparison -metonymically refers to the stereotypical <lb/>attributes of that entity. Accordingly, sentence (2) conveys that the comparee <lb/>(my heart) outdoes the standard of comparison (the sun) with regard to the <lb/>dimension along which the comparison is made (the sun&apos;s stereotypical attributes, <lb/>i.e., sunniness); in other words, my heart has even more sun-like characteristics than <lb/>the sun. Similarly, in (3), with N j differing from N i , the comparee outdoes the standard <lb/>of comparison (idiots) with respect to genius-like characteristics. <lb/>(2) <lb/>我这心里比阳光还阳光! <lb/>Wo zhe xinli <lb/>bi yangguang hai yangguang! (BCC 5 ) <lb/>I <lb/>this heart.in BI sunshine <lb/>HAI sunshine <lb/>&apos;My heart is even more sunny than the sun!&apos; <lb/>(3) <lb/>真是天才, 比白痴还天才! <lb/>Zhen <lb/>shi <lb/>tiancai, bi baichi <lb/>hai <lb/>tiancai. <lb/>Really <lb/>is <lb/>genius, BI idiot <lb/>HAI <lb/>genius <lb/>&apos;What a genius, an even better genius than the idiots.&apos; <lb/>Whereas conventional comparative constructions have received considerable <lb/>attention during the past few decades, so far only a small number of studies have <lb/>been published on the topic of the non-conventional comparative constructions [bi N i <lb/>hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ]. Previous studies (e.g., Cheng 2013; Li 2016; Yang 2011) on <lb/>these non-conventional constructions have generally put more emphasis on their <lb/>constructional meaning as well as the semantic features of their constituents, <lb/>while only touching on their emergence and development (and the mechanisms at <lb/>work therein). Typically as well, they have only discussed a few, often constructed <lb/>examples; rarely have earlier studies been corpus-based, using quantitative methods <lb/>(see Sections 3.2 and 4.3). <lb/></body>

        <body>Couched within a Diachronic Construction Grammar (DCxG) framework, the <lb/>present study examines the emergence of the Mandarin constructions [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>and [bi N i hai N j ] and explores their underlying mechanisms and motivations, <lb/>thereby also drawing on a quantitative analysis of corpus data. We propose that at <lb/>the origin of [bi N i hai N i ] lie multiple sources: [bi N hai A], [Adverb N], and the <lb/>development [Adverb A] &gt; [Adverb N]. More specifically, it is argued that [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>emerges by analogy with the conventional comparative construction [bi N hai A], <lb/>whereby the adoption of the scalar meaning of A by a N, which is in essence <lb/>non-scalar, can be viewed as coercion (Lauwers and Willems 2011). What motivates <lb/>this coercion is the metonymic relation that holds between the entity denoted by the <lb/>noun and the entity&apos;s attributes. What may further have facilitated the development <lb/>from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ] is that the dimension of comparison in the latter <lb/>construction inherited its nominal encoding from an already existing construction <lb/>[Adverb N]; in this inheritance relation, the component &quot;hai N i/j &quot; 6 of [bi N i hai N i/j ] can <lb/>be regarded as an instantiation of the more schematic [Adverb N]. A collexeme <lb/>analysis we carried out indicates that the nouns most significantly attracted to <lb/>[Adverb N] and to [bi N i hai N i ] show semantic similarity. At a more schematic level, <lb/>the extension A &gt; N observed in [bi N hai A] &gt; [bi N i hai N i ] may have been modeled <lb/>(formally and semantically) on the existing development from [Adverb A] to [Adverb <lb/>N] in Mandarin; this is a shift-cum-coercion from scalar Adjective &gt; Noun when <lb/>preceded by an adverb denoting intensification (e.g., 太 tai &apos;too&apos;, 很 hen &apos;very&apos;). <lb/>Analogical extension and inheritance also underlie the subsequent development <lb/>from [bi N i hai N i ] to [bi N i hai N j ] and indirectly also from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N j ]. <lb/>This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets the background for the study, in <lb/>which we first situate our investigation against the backdrop of previous research <lb/>(Section 2.1); we then introduce the constructions from which [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i <lb/>hai N j ] will be argued to derive: [Adverb N] (and its source [Adverb A]) and [bi N i hai <lb/>A] (Section 2.2); next is a brief introduction to the theoretical framework, <lb/>i.e., (Diachronic) Construction Grammar (Section 2.3); finally, we will attend to the <lb/>distinction between nouns and adjectives in Mandarin (Section 2.4). In Section 3, <lb/>we examine the mechanisms of and motivations for the emergence of [bi N i hai N i ], <lb/>and provide corpus-based quantitative support. Section 4 explores its further <lb/>development, viz., the emergence of [bi N i hai N j ]. Section 5 discusses the implications <lb/>of our study for (Diachronic) CxG. Section 6 presents a number of concluding <lb/>remarks. <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">6 It is impossible for &quot;hai N&quot; to serve as an analogical model for the emergence of [bi N hai N] as it is <lb/>not a standalone construction and the meaning of &quot;hai N&quot; in non-comparative constructions is <lb/>different from that in comparative constructions. We will illustrate this point in Section 2.2 and <lb/>Section 3.1 (ii). <lb/></note>

        <body>2 Background to the study <lb/>2.1 Previous research <lb/>Previous research has mainly centered on three issues. One is the constructional <lb/>meaning of [bi N i hai N i ]. In this regard, Yang (2011) notes that [bi N i hai N i ], as a <lb/>non-canonical comparative construction, does not so much compare two entities as <lb/>it profiles an attribute of the comparee (e.g., sunniness, attributed to &apos;my heart&apos; in (2)). <lb/>This view is also shared by Ji (2012) and Ma (2014), who hold that [bi N i hai N i ] serves <lb/>to profile the characteristics of the comparee. Cheng (2013: 62), then, argues that the <lb/>constructional meaning of [bi N i hai N i ] can be characterized as &quot;super or <lb/>extremely + the stereotypical attributes of the noun&quot;, which is a non-compositional <lb/>meaning that has a coloring of exaggeration. <lb/>A second focus lies with the semantic features of the nominal constituent N <lb/>sanctioned by the construction. It has been suggested that only nouns of strong <lb/>descriptive character occur in [bi N i hai N i ]. The descriptor &apos;strong descriptive <lb/>character&apos; was used, for instance, in Luo and Lu (2016), Ma (2014), and Yang (2011), to <lb/>refer to nouns with salient attributes. For instance, in 他比葛朗台还葛朗台 Ta <lb/>bi Grandet hai Grandet &apos;He is meaner than Grandet&apos;, the noun 葛朗台Grandet <lb/>(referring to the character in the famous novel Eugénie Grandet) easily fits into <lb/>the construction because it is strongly associated with the quality of being mean <lb/>(see also Cheng 2013; Li 2016). Luo and Lu (2016) note that the nouns sanctioned <lb/>into the construction have even become bywords for the salient attributes and that <lb/>the referent of the noun is usually familiar to both the speaker/writer and the <lb/>interlocutor/reader. <lb/>Thirdly, previous research has also touched on the mechanism underlying the <lb/>development of [bi N i hai N i ]. In this respect, Yang (2011) notes that the development <lb/>of [bi N i hai N i ] is analogically modeled on [bi N hai A]. Cheng (2013) as well contends <lb/>that [bi N hai A] is the source of [bi i N hai N i ], and he further proposes that the <lb/>development of the latter construction is pragmatically motivated, in that the use of a <lb/>N(oun) rather than an A(djective) avoids direct expression of the construction&apos;s <lb/>dimension of comparison. That said, Yang&apos;s and Cheng&apos;s studies provide no in-depth <lb/>exploration of the development of [bi N i hai N i ], as it is not their main focus. <lb/>In contrast, the present study presents a nuanced account of the development of <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] from [bi N hai A], and specifically what motivates the extension from <lb/>A(djectives) to N(ouns). <lb/></body>

        <body>2.2 A brief introduction to [Adverb A], [Adverb N], and <lb/>[bi N hai A] <lb/>It will be argued (see Section 3.1) that among the source constructions that are of <lb/>primary importance in the emergence and development of [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai <lb/>N j ] are [Adverb N] and [bi N hai A]. The [Adverb N] construction, which dates back to <lb/>the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), developed from a previously existing high-frequency <lb/>construction, [Adverb A], a canonical construction in Mandarin -an example is (4). <lb/>Like the adverbs in [Adverb A], the adverbs in [Adverb N] are on the whole degree <lb/>adverbs. There are at least 17 degree adverbs that participate in [Adverb N] <lb/>(cf. Li 2016: 81), such as 很 hen &apos;very&apos;, 最 zui &apos;most&apos;, 太 tai &apos;too&apos;,非常 feichang &apos;very&apos;, <lb/>exemplified in (5)-(8). <lb/>(4) <lb/>做到让人人喜欢真的很难。 <lb/>Zuo dao <lb/>rang renren <lb/>xihuan zhende hen nan. <lb/>Do arrive make every.one like <lb/>really very hard <lb/>&apos;It&apos;s really hard to be liked by everyone.&apos; <lb/>(5) <lb/>每个班总有一个很爷们儿的女生。 <lb/>Meige ban zong <lb/>you yi <lb/>ge hen yemener de <lb/>nvsheng. <lb/>Each class always have one CL very menfolk MOD Girl <lb/>&apos;There is always a very masculine girl in each class.&apos; <lb/>(6) <lb/>忘记带钥匙最悲剧 了。 <lb/>Wangji <lb/>dai <lb/>yaoshi <lb/>zui <lb/>beiju <lb/>le. <lb/>Forget <lb/>bring <lb/>key <lb/>very <lb/>tragedy <lb/>PERF <lb/>&apos;Forgetting to bring the key is one of the most tragic things.&apos; <lb/>(7) <lb/>这个动作太爷们了。 <lb/>Zhe ge dongzuo tai yemen <lb/>le. <lb/>This CL action <lb/>too menfolk PERF <lb/>&apos;This action is too mannish.&apos; <lb/>(8) <lb/>我妹妹现在大学还没毕业, 非常青春 ! <lb/>Wo meimei <lb/>xianzai daxue <lb/>hai mei biye, <lb/>feichang <lb/>I <lb/>younger.sister now <lb/>university yet not graduate, extremely <lb/>qingchun! <lb/>youth <lb/>&apos;My sister has not graduated from university yet, and she is very young!&apos; <lb/></body>

        <note place="headnote">Liu et al. <lb/></note>

        <body>The other source construction is [bi N hai A], a frequently-used, canonical compar-<lb/>ative construction in Mandarin Chinese, as in (1), first attested in the late Yuan <lb/>dynasty (14th century) in the CCL corpus. As 还 hai is also an adverb in Mandarin, this <lb/>construction is closely related to [Adverb A], in that the component part &quot;hai A&quot; of [bi <lb/>N hai A] instantiates the more schematic [Adverb A]. A variant of hai, namely, 更 geng <lb/>can collocate with either an adjective or a noun constituting constructions [geng A] <lb/>or [geng N] with the capacity to function as predicates, as exemplified by instances <lb/>such as 她更美 ta geng mei &apos;she is more beautiful&apos; and 他更绅士 ta geng shenshi &apos;he is <lb/>more gentleman-like&apos;. At the same time, [geng N] can also work as a component part <lb/>of a comparative construction, viz., [bi N geng N], 7 as in 他比老板更老板 ta bi laoban <lb/>geng laoban &apos;he is bossier than a boss&apos;, which is a variant of [bi N hai N]. <lb/>2.3 Theoretical framework: (diachronic) construction grammar <lb/>The present study is couched within (Diachronic) CxG, a framework that exploits <lb/>the &quot;fit between the mechanisms of syntactic change and the basic principles of <lb/>Construction Grammar&quot; (Barðdal and Gildea 2015: 9). Or, as Perek (2020: 142) puts it, <lb/>&quot;Diachronic Construction Grammar aims to describe and explain language change <lb/>by drawing on the idea that the grammar of a language consists of an inventory of <lb/>form-meaning pairs, called constructions.&quot; An important tenet of CxG is its network <lb/>design, whereby all constructions form a structured inventory or a network of <lb/>constructions, called a &quot;construct-i-con&quot; by Goldberg (2003: 219). This network <lb/>comprises vertical (taxonomic and meronymic) as well as horizontal links 8 between <lb/>constructions. As Smirnova and Sommerer (2020: 3) point out, the incorporation of <lb/>linguistic changes into CxG entails their reconceptualization as &apos;network changes&apos;, <lb/>which may involve, among others, node creation (giving rise to constructionaliza-<lb/>tion) and constructional network reconfiguration. 9 <lb/>Like CxG, DCxG is usage-based in that linguistic change is shaped by language <lb/>use (Barlow and Kemmer 2000; Bybee 2010; Diessel 2019; Hopper 1987; Langacker <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">7 It can plausibly be assumed that these geng-constructions can partake of a more encompassing <lb/>network of conventional and unconventional comparative constructions, whereby [bi N i geng N i ] <lb/>forms a sister node with [bi N i hai N i ], together forming the higher-order schema [bi N Adverb N]. As a <lb/>reviewer further pointed out, the presence of [bi N i geng N i ] as a sister node of [bi N i hai N i ] may <lb/>mutually strengthen these constructions, in that the [bi N i geng N i ] construction may exhibit semantic <lb/>similarity with [bi N i hai N i ] in terms of collocating nouns (on the importance of collocating nouns in <lb/>the development of [bi N i hai N i ], see Section 3.2). <lb/>8 Horizontal links have, on the whole, received less attention than vertical links. <lb/>9 Smirnova and Sommerer (2020: 3) also mention node loss (giving rise to constructional death) and <lb/>node-internal changes (giving rise to constructional change), but these will be seen to be less relevant <lb/>for the present paper. <lb/></note>

        <body>2000; Schmid 2020). Major components of this usage-based approach which will <lb/>be seen to play a role in the present study are frequency, entrenchment, and gen-<lb/>eral cognitive abilities such as analogical reasoning and schematization (see also <lb/>Smirnova and Sommerer 2020: 2). <lb/>Analogy, apart from being a mechanism of linguistic change, can be viewed as a <lb/>domain-general cognitive processing mechanism: it is at the basis of speakers&apos; ability <lb/>to create novel utterances (Bybee 2010: 75). The prerequisite of analogical processing <lb/>is language users&apos; recognition -conscious or subliminal -of similarities between two <lb/>structural or functional contexts. <lb/>Another central tenet in usage-based linguistics, and a major factor in <lb/>grammatical change, is frequency of use. Frequent instances of a construction <lb/>impact its cognitive representation, in that each instance contributes to the <lb/>representation of the construction as a unit in the minds of language users, thus <lb/>increasing its entrenchment and automatization (e.g., Diessel 2019: 1; Schmid 2020: <lb/>216). Frequency plays an important role in analogical extension: as Sommerer (2015: <lb/>11) points out, a speaker can extend a construction analogically only if they become <lb/>aware of it in the first place and &quot;[s]uch awareness will be favored or triggered by <lb/>the construction&apos;s high frequency&quot;. <lb/>2.4 Nouns versus adjectives <lb/>Just like [Adverb N] has been said to have developed from [Adverb A] (see Section <lb/>2.2), the [bi N i hai N i ] construction will be seen to develop from [bi N hai A] (Section <lb/>3.1). In either case, a noun is recruited into a slot where it is modified by an adverb; <lb/>at the same time, adverbial modification is a typical characteristic of adjectives/ <lb/>verbs. Does this mean that the nouns recruited into this slot have become adjec-<lb/>tives? To answer that question, we draw on Zhu&apos;s (1997: 207, 213) insight that there is <lb/>no correspondence between word class and syntactic function in Chinese: when an <lb/>adjective or verb fills an argument position (e.g., subject or object) in a sentence, it <lb/>remains a verb or adjective and does not change into a noun. In the same vein, <lb/>when a noun fills the adjectival slot in [Adverb A] or [bi N hai A] (resulting <lb/>in [Adverb N] and [bi N i hai N i ]), it remains a noun, because it has properties <lb/>not shared by adjectives. Zhu (1997: 204) notes that in Mandarin, the distinction <lb/>between nouns and adjectives/verbs is prominent in that adjectives and verbs <lb/>pertain to the category of 谓词 weici &apos;predicate words&apos;; this means that both verbs <lb/>and adjectives usually serve as predicates in a sentence, and when they are <lb/>predicates, they can be followed by aspect markers such as 了le or 着 zhe, while <lb/>nouns are seldom used as predicates. <lb/></body>

        <body>In general, nouns &quot;characteristically represent entities, real or imagined, in the <lb/>concrete or virtual world&quot; (Shi 2016: 199) such as 孔子 Kongzi &apos;Confucius&apos;, 律师 lvshi <lb/>&apos;lawyer&apos;, 会议 huiyi &apos;conference&apos;, while adjectives denote properties of entities <lb/>(Huang et al. 2016: 276) such as 漂亮 piaoliang &apos;beautiful&apos;, 白 bai &apos;white&apos;, 安静 anjing <lb/>&apos;quiet&apos;. Among the (more specific) distinguishing properties of adjectives are their <lb/>amenability to affixation and reduplication (see Huang et al. 2016: 276-296; Shi 2016: <lb/>199-255). Nouns recruited into the [Adverb A] or [bi N hai A] structures, then, will not <lb/>lose their nominal properties, nor will they assume these adjectival properties. 10 <lb/>3 The emergence of [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>In this section, we first discuss (the mechanisms underlying) the emergence of [bi N i <lb/>hai N i ]. In particular, we suggest that [bi N i hai N i ] has developed from three sources, <lb/>[bi N hai A], [Adverb N], and the earlier development from [Adverb A] to [Adverb N]. <lb/>Additional support for our analysis will come from a collostructional analysis. <lb/>3.1 The multiple sources of [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>(i) [bi N hai A] as a source. It has been amply argued that language users can create <lb/>novel expressions on the basis of analogical extension from (i.e., perceived similarity <lb/>in form and/or meaning with) previously existing conventionalized phrases (Boas <lb/>2003; Bybee 2010: 60, 63; Gentner and Markman 1997; Krott et al. 2006). This means <lb/>that many utterances are actually only partly novel. In this respect, Schmid (2020: <lb/>100) defines innovations as &quot;partly licensed utterances&quot;, and Traugott and Trousdale <lb/>(2013: 58) note that &quot;no construction is entirely new (except those that are borrowings <lb/>and some coinings)&quot;. <lb/>(9) <lb/>苍天啊! 一副眼镜比机票还贵。 <lb/>Cangtian a! yi <lb/>fu yanjing bi jipiao <lb/>hai gui. <lb/>God <lb/>FP!

        <body>Against this background, we argue that it is through analogical extension that the <lb/>construction [bi N i hai N i ] developed from the prior, conventionalized [bi N hai A], as <lb/>in (9). The source construction [bi N hai A] is attested from the 14th century 11 (i.e., the <lb/>late Yuan Dynasty) in the corpus CCL, while the earliest attested instance of [bi N i <lb/>hai N i ] (see example (10)) can only be dated back to 1969. In this process of <lb/>analogical modeling, frequency has been argued to play an important role <lb/>(Mańczak 1980; Bybee 2010: 25, 63). As Sommerer (2015: 118) states: &quot;[T]he speaker <lb/>can extend a specific schema analogically only if s/he becomes aware of it in the <lb/>first place. Such awareness will be favored … by the high frequency of syntactic <lb/>patterns which are compatible with such an underlying schematic representa-<lb/>tion&quot;. The attested normalized frequency of occurrences instantiating [bi N hai A] <lb/>is 7.26 per million characters in the multi-genre 12 sub-corpus of BCC.

They are more brutal than imperialism&quot;.&apos; <lb/>What does the analogical extension consist in? [bi N hai A] is a conventionalized <lb/>construction conveying that a comparee takes a position on a standard or scale <lb/>(expressed by A -the dimension of comparison) that is even higher (hai) than the <lb/>(high) position taken by N (the standard of comparison). By way of example, consider <lb/>examples (1) and (9). In instances such as these, [bi N hai A] provides an analogical <lb/>base for [bi N i hai N i ]. Specifically, in employing [bi N i hai N i ], speakers retain <lb/>the meaning of the previously existing conventionalized expression [bi N hai A]. <lb/>They also retain a good part of its form, but they do modify A into N. In the process, <lb/>non-scalar N is adjusted or reinterpreted in terms of N&apos;s typical, scalar attributes; <lb/>for instance, 阳光 yangguang &apos;sunlight&apos; in (2) is interpreted as &apos;sunniness&apos;, i.e., in <lb/>terms of the scalar attributes of the sun; in (3), 天才tiancai &apos;genius&apos; is reinterpreted as <lb/>(scalar) &apos;genius-like&apos; characteristics. We suggest that the interpretation of N as A, and <lb/>hence the extension of [bi N i hai N i ] from [bi N hai A], can be attributed to coercion 13 <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">13 As one of the reviewers points out, while the constructional meaning of [bi N hai A] plays a role -<lb/>through coercion -in the interpretation of the new construction [bi N i hai N i ], it is also advisable to <lb/>pay attention to the nature of the words filling the N-slot. A first impression of these words is given in <lb/>Table 2, listing the most frequently used types in the N-slot. This reviewer further proposes that the <lb/>constructional meaning of [bi N i hai N i ] may also result from the interaction between the con-<lb/>struction and the semantic nature of the noun (N i ). In other words, not all nouns are sanctioned into <lb/>the [bi N i hai N i ] construction. While we have not carried out a detailed analysis of the semantic <lb/>characteristics of the nouns that are sanctioned into the [bi N i hai N i ] construction, the existing <lb/>literature suggests that the N-slot is typically filled by generic nouns (i.e., nouns not modified by <lb/>definite articles, demonstratives or other modifiers) and some proper nouns featuring idiosyncratic <lb/>and striking attributes (see also our literature survey in Section 2.1). Furthermore, we explored the <lb/></note>

        <body>(Lauwers and Willems 2011; Michaelis 2005; Traugott and Trousdale 2013: 204-206). <lb/>As Perek (2020: 147) points out, coercion captures the fact that &quot;speakers occasionally <lb/>push the boundaries of conventional usage&quot;. In this case, while the noun in the <lb/>construction does not have a scalar meaning of itself and would therefore make <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] ill-formed, it can adopt the scalar meaning under influence of <lb/>[bi N hai A]&apos;s constructional/schematic meaning &apos;higher (than expected) position on <lb/>a scale than&apos;. What facilitates reinterpreting N as A is likely the metonymic relationship <lb/>between N and its stereotypical (scalar or N-like) attributes. 14 Perek (2020: 147-148) <lb/>further highlights that &quot;if similar instances of coercion recur, the adjusted schema can <lb/>itself become a conventional unit&quot;. A possible consequence is that a higher-order <lb/>schema [bi N hai X] may emerge, covering both the original [bi N hai A] construction <lb/>and the adjusted/analogized construction [bi N i hai N i ], as Figure 1 shows. 15 <lb/>In this case, then, we can observe that the criterion for sanctioning an item <lb/>entering the schematic slot of a construction is not semantic similarity to the <lb/>central member(s) of the slot (as, for instance, insane and nuts are sanctioned <lb/>in [drive someone X] via semantic similarity to the prototypical fillers mad or <lb/>crazy (see Bybee 2010: 36-37)), but semantic contiguity, i.e., a metonymic <lb/>relationship. <lb/>Within the framework of DCxG, these linguistic changes involve node creation <lb/>([bi N i hai N i ]) and possibly also constructional network reconfiguration (if a <lb/>higher-order schematic construction [bi N hai X] emerges). The analogical extension <lb/>from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ] is to be situated at the same level of schematicity; <lb/>bi N hai X <lb/>bi N hai A <lb/>bi Ni hai Ni <lb/>Figure 1: Network of the [bi N hai X] comparative construction family. <lb/></body>

That is, the reason why an adverb can collocate with a <lb/>noun is that there exists a metonymic relation between the noun and its attributes, so that the noun <lb/>can metonymically refers to its attributes in the construction (see also below). <lb/>15 In this respect, Perek (2020: 148) points to a similar statement by Traugott and Trousdale (2013: 16): <lb/>&quot;[P]artially sanctioned extensions of an existing conventionalized construction may over time <lb/>become fully sanctioned instances of a more general, schematic construction&quot;. <lb/></note>

        <body>it thus constitutes a horizontal link (see, e.g., Smirnova and Sommerer 2020: 25-28) <lb/>symbolizing partial similarity and non-inheritance. 16 <lb/>(ii) [Adverb N] as a source. A second construction motivating the emergence of <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] is the schematic construction [Adverb N], 17 dating back to the <lb/>Qing dynasty (1644-1912) in the CCL corpus. 18 Unlike the source construction [bi N hai <lb/>A], which is linked horizontally with [bi N i hai N i ] (i.e., situated at the same level of <lb/>schematicity) by analogical extension, [Adverb N] is taxonomically linked up with <lb/>the constructional constituent &quot;hai N&quot; of [bi N i hai N i ] through inheritance. In this <lb/>respect, Goldberg (1995: 98) notes that constituents of constructions can inherit from <lb/>other, higher-order constructions as well. Hence, the constituent &quot;hai N&quot; of [bi N i hai <lb/>N i ] can inherit from [Adverb N]. This notion of inheritance &quot;captures a relation <lb/>between more abstract constructions, which are situated towards the top of the <lb/>constructional network, and more specific constructions, which are found in lower <lb/>levels of the constructional hierarchy&quot; (Hilpert 2014: 57). The type of inheritance link <lb/>at stake here is an instance link, which is the basic type of inheritance link (see <lb/>Goldberg 1995: 79-80; Hilpert 2014: 60; Traugott and Trousdale 2013: 50): 还 hai is an <lb/>adverb and when it is used as a component part of a comparative construction, it can <lb/>denote a degree difference in quality, namely, expressing &apos;being more (than ex-<lb/>pected)&apos; (Lü 1999). Thus, 还 hai in [bi N hai X] is an instantiation of the general <lb/>category &apos;(Degree) Adverb&apos;. Summing up so far, we contend that the emergence of [bi <lb/>N i hai N i ] is not only the result of analogical extension (see above), but it has also <lb/>developed through inheritance, that is, by its instantiating the highly frequent <lb/>schema [Adverb N]. 19 <lb/>(11) <lb/>盗别人作品不是盗窃么? 还学生呢! <lb/>Dao bieren zuopin bu shi <lb/>daoqie me?

        <note place="footnote">16 The fact that constructional networks also contain horizontal links was already pointed out by <lb/>Langacker (2000: 102), who talks about the &quot;outward growth&quot; of a network. <lb/>17 It would actually be more correct to label this construction [Degree Adverb N]; however, we will <lb/>follow common practice in the Chinese linguistic literature here, and use the more general label <lb/>[Adverb N]. <lb/>18 The earliest instance of [Adverb N] is attested in the novel 《八仙得道》&apos;The Eight Enlightened <lb/>Immortals&apos;: 这位春瑛小姐, … 简直还是一位很清高很贞节而又非常近情的好女子 &apos;This Miss Chu-<lb/>nying… is also a very virtuous and chaste woman who is very sensible&apos;. <lb/>19 The normalized frequency in the multi-genre sub-corpus of BCC of [hen N], the prototypical <lb/>instance of [Adverb N], is 64.65 per million characters. Hence, that of [Adverb N] must be much <lb/>higher. <lb/></note>

        <body>A caveat is in order here. Although [hai N] (as in (11)) is an independent construction <lb/>in Mandarin, it is impossible for it to be the up-level schema of [bi N i hai N i ] as the <lb/>meaning of independent [hai N] is quite different from that of the component &quot;hai N&quot; <lb/>in [bi N i hai N i ]. As example (11) shows, in [hai N ne/na], the noun is referential while <lb/>in instances such as (2), the noun following hai in [bi N i hai N i ] is not referential, i.e., it <lb/>does not denote an entity, but it metonymically refers to the entity&apos;s stereotypical <lb/>attributes. Similarly, the noun in [Adverb N], as in (5)-(8), is not referential either. <lb/>According to Lü (1999), 还 hai is an adverb expressing tones (e.g., of sarcasm, sur-<lb/>prise, praise) in Mandarin and only when it is used in comparative constructions can <lb/>it denote a degree difference in quality, namely, expressing &apos;being more (than ex-<lb/>pected)&apos;. Hence, in [hai N ne/na], as in (11), 还 hai is an adverb denoting tones while in <lb/>the comparative construction such as [bi N hai A] and [bi N hai N], it expresses a <lb/>degree difference in quality. In addition, there is a distinction in grammatical stress <lb/>placement between [hai N ne/na] and [bi N hai N]. In [hai N ne/na], the stress falls on <lb/>the N, whereas in [bi N hai N], the stress falls on 还 hai. <lb/>As Zong (1995) notes, in actual usage events, [hai N ne/na] denotes that the <lb/>subject should have behaved the way Ns usually behave and thus conveying a tone of <lb/>blame or sarcasm, as expressed by [hai xuesheng ne] in (11). Specifically, what the <lb/>speaker intends to express in (11) is that stealing others&apos; work is not what a student <lb/>should do, but the student did it anyway. Zong (1995) also compares the semantics of <lb/>the nouns in [hai N ne] with those in [bi N i hai N i ] and finds that the semantic <lb/>categories of nouns in these two constructions are quite different: the nouns in <lb/>[hai N ne] are predominantly nouns denoting people&apos;s occupations, titles/ranks or <lb/>status, while those in [bi N i hai N i ] cover a much wider range of categories. <lb/>(iii) The related constructions [Adverb A] and [Adverb N]. Importantly, <lb/>[Adverb N] can itself be said to have developed from [Adverb A] by analogical <lb/>extension, whereby -in a way similar to the shift from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ] -<lb/>the meaning &apos;A to a still high/higher degree&apos; is retained, but the form gets adjusted <lb/>(A &gt; N). Moreover, given that the schematic constructions [Adverb A] and [Adverb N] <lb/>are both present for speakers of Mandarin at a time when the [bi N i hai N i ] con-<lb/>struction had not developed yet, 20 it is likely that these speakers viewed them as <lb/>related (that is, as horizontally linked nodes in a constructional network). We suggest <lb/>these linked schematic nodes may have facilitated the shift of the dimension-of-<lb/>comparison slot from A in [bi N hai A] to N in [bi N i hai N i ], as illustrated in Figure 2. <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">20 Recall that [Adverb N] dates back to the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) and had developed from a <lb/>previously existing high-frequency construction [Adverb A] (see Section 2.2). <lb/></note>

        <body>3.2 Finding quantitative evidence for [Adverb N] as a source <lb/>If our assumption is correct that [bi N i hai N i ] emerged via the extension of the A <lb/>slot in [bi N hai A] to nouns via inheriting the nominal feature from [Adverb N], <lb/>it would not be unreasonable to expect that the semantic categories of nouns that <lb/>are significantly attracted to [bi N i hai N i ] are correspondent to those attracted to <lb/>[Adverb N]. This type of analogy does not involve identifying a common pattern (as in <lb/>[bi N i hai A] &gt; [bi N i hai N i ] or in [Adverb N] &gt; &quot;hai N&quot; as a component of [bi N i hai N i ]), <lb/>but rather consists in similarity of conceptual content (labeled &quot;concrete property <lb/>matches&quot; in Gentner and Smith 2012: 130, or &quot;physical similarities&quot; in Behrens 2017: <lb/>222). To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a collostructional analysis. <lb/>Data for this study were retrieved from the corpus BCC (Xun et al. 2016). BCC has <lb/>a total size of about 9.5 billion characters and it comprises five genre-based sub-<lb/>corpora: news reportage (2 billion), literary works (3 billion), dialogues (600 million), <lb/>multi-genre (1.9 billion), and Literary Chinese (2 billion). The corpus was tagged for <lb/>part of speech. <lb/>Since the [bi N i hai N i ] construction is a relatively recent development -its <lb/>earliest attested instance can only be dated back to 1969 and the earliest attested <lb/>occurrence of [bi N i hai N j ] dates from 1980, 21 the data were retrieved from the <lb/>multi-genre sub-corpus of the BCC Contemporary Chinese corpus. This sub-corpus <lb/>is balanced by genre, including texts from newspapers, fictions, micro-blogs, and <lb/>academic journal articles of science and technology. <lb/>We searched the multi-genre sub-corpus of the BCC corpus with the query &quot;bi n <lb/>hai n&quot;. In all, 559 concordances of [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ] were retrieved.

        <body>manual removal of noise, 314 instances of [bi N i hai N i ] and 149 instances of [bi N i hai <lb/>N j ] were retained. To compare the semantic features of nouns in [bi N i hai N i ] with <lb/>those in [Adverb N], we searched the multi-genre sub-corpus of the BCC corpus with <lb/>the query &quot;hen n&quot; and obtained 64,648 concordances, from which we randomly <lb/>sampled 1000 concordances. After discarding noise, we retained 264 instances of <lb/>[hen N]. 22 <lb/>To examine the similarities between the lexical preferences expressed by N <lb/>in [bi N i hai N i ] and [Adverb N], we conducted a simple collexeme analysis 23 <lb/>(e.g., Stefanowitsch 2006, 2013; Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003), which can determine <lb/>which nouns are statistically significantly associated with each of the two <lb/>constructions when compared against the language as a whole. Albeit subject to <lb/>some criticism (e.g., Divjak 2008; Schmid 2010; Schmid and Küchenhoff 2013), <lb/>collostructional analysis is still regarded as a useful method to calculate the <lb/>association strength between a construction and its slot-fillers. <lb/>For every noun in [bi N i hai N i ] and in [hen N], we calculate its association <lb/>strength with the construction via computing a 2-by-2 contingency table which <lb/>contains four different frequencies of occurrence: the frequency of the target noun in <lb/>the target construction (A), the frequency of the target noun in the corpus in general <lb/>(B), the frequency of the construction filled with other nouns than the target noun (C), <lb/>and the frequency of all other constructions with lexemes other than the target noun <lb/>(D). <lb/>On the basis of these frequencies, the expected frequencies and the association <lb/>measure can be calculated. Based on the contingency table, we also derived the log <lb/>odds ratio as well as the 95 % confidence interval for every noun (Schmid and <lb/>Küchenhoff 2013). A significantly positive log odds ratio suggests that the noun is <lb/>attracted to the construction whereas a significantly negative log odds ratio indicates <lb/>that the noun is repelled. Figures 3 and 4 visualize the most important part of the <lb/>results: the top 30 significantly attracted nouns (purple bars) and the top 4 repelled <lb/>nouns (green bars). <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">22 We are aware that, rather than using [hen N] as a proxy for [Adverb N], it would have been <lb/>preferable to include at least a selection of degree adverbs combining with N in the collostructional <lb/>analysis, but operationally, this was difficult to do (many spurious hits). Specifically, we tried to <lb/>extract data from BCC with the query &quot;d n&quot; (&quot;d&quot; is the tagging for adverbs and &quot;n&quot; is the tagging for <lb/>nouns in the corpus), but the overwhelming majority of the concordances obtained was not felicitous <lb/>as in Mandarin sentence structure, an adverb can serve as an adverbial located at the beginning of a <lb/>sentence, which can then be followed by a noun that serves as the subject as in 终于论文写完了 <lb/>zhongyu lunwen xiewan le &apos;(literally) Finally thesis write finish PERF&apos;. <lb/>23 Following Sommerer and Baumann (2021), we made some minor adjustments to overcome sta-<lb/>tistical shortcomings (see Schmid and Küchenhoff 2013).

        <body>To examine whether the (types of) nouns attracted to the two constructions are <lb/>similar, we tested the association between the semantic categories of the most <lb/>attracted nouns in [bi N i hai N i ] and in [Adverb N], making use of a Fischer&apos;s <lb/>exact test. This test revealed that there is no statistically significant difference <lb/>(p = 0.1164) between the frequencies of the categories of most attracted nouns in the <lb/>two constructions, indicating that there is a fair degree of semantic similarity be-<lb/>tween the nouns attracted to the two constructions. <lb/>In summary, we have seen that the emergence of [bi N i hai N i ] can be attributed <lb/>to multiple sources: there exist both formal and semantic similarities between the <lb/>analogical model construction [bi N hai A] and the target [bi N i hai N i ], such that the <lb/>latter emerged by analogy with the former; next, [bi N i hai N i ] also inherits from <lb/>[Adverb N]; furthermore, the development [Adverb A] &gt; [Adverb N] might have <lb/>facilitated the shift from [bi N i hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ] (Trousdale 2013; Van de Velde <lb/>et al. 2013). <lb/>4 From [bi N i hai N i ] to [bi N i hai N j ] <lb/>Following the emergence of [bi N i hai N i ], this construction further developed into <lb/>[bi N i hai N j ], where N j is different from N i . While the earliest attested instance of <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] in BCC dates back to 1969, the earliest attested occurrence of [bi N i hai N j ] <lb/>dates from 1980. In this section, we will discuss the mechanisms of and motivations <lb/>for the emergence of [bi N i hai N j ], and the semantic change involved in the <lb/>dimension slot of [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ] via a quantitative analysis of corpus <lb/>data. <lb/>4.1 The emergence of [bi N i hai N j ] <lb/>We have seen that in [bi N i hai N i ], the noun following hai -expressing the dimension <lb/>of comparison -does not refer to a specific entity but metonymically refers to the <lb/>entity&apos;s stereotypical attributes and is used to specify the attributes of the comparee. <lb/>What [bi N i hai N j ], as exemplified in (12), shares with [bi N i hai N i ] is that N j does not <lb/>refer to a specific entity either. What differentiates the two constructions is that in [bi <lb/>N i hai N j ], the noun expressing the dimension of comparison (N j ) differs from the <lb/>noun expressing the standard of comparison (N i ). Accordingly, in (12), N j 剧情 juqing <lb/>&apos;plot&apos; metonymically refers to the quality of being plotty, and the comparee (the case <lb/>analysis) has more of the stereotypical attributes of a plot (N j ) than a novel (N i ). Since <lb/>N j is different from N i , this construction enjoys relatively more freedom to denote <lb/>comparison than [bi N i hai N i ]. <lb/></body>

The model essay <lb/>of analysis is more poetic than a prose and is more plotty than a novel.&apos; <lb/>We retrieved (after manual cleanup) 149 tokens of [bi N i hai N j ] from the multi-genre <lb/>sub-corpus of the BCC corpus, with 133 types and 101 hapax legomena, as shown in <lb/>Table 4. The type/token ratio is very high, which suggests that the construction is very <lb/>productive (Bybee 2010; Dąbrowska 2008, among others). <lb/>We suggest that [bi N i hai N i ] has served as an analogical base for [bi N i hai N j ], whereby <lb/>the latter construction has retained the structural pattern as well as meaning of the <lb/>former. Structurally, the standard and the dimension of comparison are each <lb/>expressed by a noun; semantically, the two constructions each convey that the com-<lb/>paree has even more of the stereotypical attributes of the dimension of comparison <lb/>(N j /N i ) than the standard of comparison (N i /N i ). The change that can be observed is that <lb/>the nouns expressing the standard and dimension of comparison no longer need to be <lb/>identical. That is, [bi N i hai N i ] only partially sanctions [bi N i hai N j ], just as [bi N hai A] <lb/>only partially sanctions [bi N hai N].

        <body>4.2 Interim summary <lb/>The change from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ] and then to [bi N i hai N j ] shows an <lb/>expansion of the dimension-of-comparison slot. In the first stage of the development, <lb/>from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ], the dimension-of-comparison slot expands from an <lb/>adjective to a noun which is the same in form as the noun denoting the standard of <lb/>comparison. We have seen that there are several motivating factors, or sources, <lb/>of this change: (i) analogy-based extension from [bi N hai A], whereby its scalar <lb/>meaning is transferred to a formally similar structure, with, in its dimension-of-<lb/>comparison slot, a noun that is identical to the noun in the standard-of-comparison <lb/>slot; the noun in the dimension-of-comparison slot metonymically refers to the <lb/>typical scalar attribute(s) of its referent, thus aligning its semantics with the scalar <lb/>semantics of adjectives; (ii) [Adverb N], which is taxonomically linked up with the <lb/>constructional component &quot;hai N&quot; of [bi N i hai N i ] through inheritance: the category <lb/>Adverb is instantiated by hai and the dimension-of-comparison slot of [bi N hai A] <lb/>inherits the nominal feature of [Adverb N]; (iii) the shift [Adverb A] &gt; [Adverb N] <lb/>facilitates the shift to [bi N i hai N i ]; (iv) conceptual similarity between the type of <lb/>nouns attracted to [Adverb N] and [bi N i hai N i ]. The second stage, from [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>to [bi N i hai N j ], is directly analogous to [bi N i hai N i ], with [bi N hai A] as a <lb/>latent analogical supporting pattern. As it did in the first stage, metonymy plays a <lb/>facilitating role in this stage as well. <lb/>4.3 Quantitative description <lb/>We have seen that in the [bi N i hai N i ] construction, the nouns expressing the <lb/>standard and dimension of comparison are formally identical; in the [bi N i hai N j ] <lb/>construction, which developed from [bi N i hai N i ], this is no longer the case. It <lb/>therefore seems worthwhile investigating how these two constructions compare; <lb/>specifically, we will examine the semantic features of the nouns in the dimension-of-<lb/>comparison slot of the two constructions. 25 To that end, the semantic annotation <lb/>scheme used to categorize the nouns in [bi N i hai N i ] and [Adverb N] (in particular <lb/>[hen N]) (see Section 3.2) is employed here as well; that is, nouns are classified into <lb/>five categories: &apos;abstract concept&apos;, &apos;place&apos;, &apos;object&apos;, &apos;animal&apos;, and &apos;human&apos;. <lb/>Figure 6 illustrates the change in the distribution of semantic features of the <lb/>nouns in the dimension-of-comparison slot of the two constructions, viz., the second <lb/>N i in [bi N i hai N i ] and N j in [bi N i hai N j ]. In [bi N i hai N i ], 53 percent of collocates <lb/></body>

        <note place="footnote">25 We have also examined pragmatic and lexical differences between the two constructions, but <lb/>little difference was observed with regard to these factors and hence they are not presented here. <lb/></note>

        <body>(i.e., 165 instances) consist of nouns referring to humans. Nouns denoting animals <lb/>rank second, 18 percent (56 instances). Instances boasting the third largest number <lb/>are those involving nouns encoding objects (40 instances), which is followed by <lb/>instances with nouns denoting abstract concepts (38 instances). At 5 % (15 instances), <lb/>nouns expressing places take up the smallest share. In [bi N i hai N j ], a different <lb/>picture is observed. The majority of nouns in the N j slot now denote abstract con-<lb/>cepts, accounting for 57 percent (85 instances) of all nouns, or four times more than <lb/>their share in [bi N i hai N i ]. Further, the proportion of &apos;animals&apos; rises by almost 18 <lb/>percent to 26 percent (39 instances); in contrast, nouns designating people drop to <lb/>about 12 percent (17 instances) -a big decline from their share in [bi N i hai N i ]. <lb/>Finally, there are no nouns denoting places appearing in the N j slot of [bi N i hai N j ]. It <lb/>can be seen, then, that the majority of N j slots is filled by abstract nouns denoting an <lb/>abstract quality of the comparee, as in 女人比男人还野心 nüren bi nanren hai yexin <lb/>&apos;this woman is even more ambitious than men&apos; (literally, this woman BI men HAI <lb/>ambition). This suggests that the [bi N i hai N j ] construction can be aligned with (or, is <lb/>similar to) [bi N hai A], in that abstract concepts are very much in line with the <lb/>general semantic profile of adjectives, which prototypically denote a(n) (abstract) <lb/>quality. This semantic alignment of N j with adjectives, denoting abstract qualities, we <lb/>argue, is in keeping with Gentner and Smith&apos;s (2012: 130) &quot;concrete property <lb/>matches&quot; (see also Section 3.2; Behrens 2017: 222). <lb/>The development from [bi N i hai N i ] to [bi N i hai N j ] is in accord with Perek&apos;s <lb/>(2016) observation that diachronically, new types of a construction tend to be <lb/>semantically close to already existing types. Also related to this fact is the attraction <lb/>effect proposed by De Smet et al. (2018), who note that as a result of analogy, <lb/>38 <lb/>85 <lb/>56 <lb/>39 <lb/>165 <lb/>17 <lb/>40 <lb/>8 <lb/>15 <lb/>0% <lb/>10% <lb/>20% <lb/>30% <lb/>40% <lb/>50% <lb/>60% <lb/>70% <lb/>80% <lb/>90% <lb/>100% <lb/>bi Ni hai Ni <lb/>bi Ni hai Nj <lb/>place <lb/>object <lb/>human <lb/>animal <lb/>abstract concept <lb/>Figure 6: The semantic property of the noun in [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ]. <lb/></body>

        <body>&quot;competing forms often show attraction, becoming functionally more (instead of <lb/>less) alike&quot;. This may also be the case for the development from [bi N i hai N i ] to [bi N i <lb/>hai N j ]. That is, the canonical comparative construction [bi N hai A] attracts the noun <lb/>comparative construction [bi N i hai N i ] and makes it remove the constraint on the <lb/>second noun (i.e., the second noun should be formally identical to the first noun), <lb/>thus giving rise to the emergence of [bi N i hai N j ]. In this process, the second noun can <lb/>be extended to more abstract nouns, leading the whole construction to behave more <lb/>similarly to [bi N hai A]. <lb/>5 Implications for (diachronic) construction <lb/>grammar <lb/>What has become apparent from the preceding discussion is that [bi N i hai N i ] has <lb/>developed from several constructional sources. First, there are the two previously <lb/>existing, high-frequency constructions [bi N hai A] and [Adverb N]; second, the <lb/>existing link between [Adverb A] and [Adverb N] may also have facilitated the shift <lb/>from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i hai N i ]. The formation of [bi N i hai N j ] equally results from <lb/>several sources: it is directly analogous to [bi N i hai N i ], but it is also facilitated by [bi <lb/>N hai A] and [Adverb N]. In addition, we have explored the role of conceptual <lb/>similarity (i) between the types of nouns in [Adverb N] and [bi N i hai N i ] and (ii) <lb/>between adjectives and abstract nouns in [bi N hai A] and [bi N i hai N j ], respectively. <lb/>These linked up construction pairs (e.g., [bi N i hai N i ] and [bi N i hai N j ] or [Adverb <lb/>N] and [bi N i hai N i ]) should not be seen as isolated phenomena; rather, they make up <lb/>a network of nodes (constructions) and relations representing the organization of <lb/>our linguistic knowledge (see Smirnova and Sommerer 2020: 2). A representation <lb/>of this constructional network can be found in Figure 7. Some relations make up <lb/>Adverb A <lb/>bi N hai X <lb/>bi N hai A <lb/>bi Ni hai Ni <lb/>bi Ni hai Nj <lb/>Adverb N <lb/>Figure 7: The constructional network of [bi N hai N]. <lb/></body>

        <page>23 <lb/></page>

        <body>vertical connections in the network, whereby lower-level constructions inherit <lb/>features from higher-level constructions; for instance, the component &quot;hai N&quot; of <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ] instantiates the higher-level construction [Adverb N] in that hai is an <lb/>adverb combining with a noun. Other relations are horizontal, as is the analogy-<lb/>based development from [bi N i hai N i ] to [bi N i hai N j ], where the former construction <lb/>partially sanctions the latter. In Figure 7, solid arrows are used for a relationship <lb/>between a schema and a more specific construction instantiating or elaborating it, <lb/>and a dashed arrow shows a horizontal, extensional relationship, i.e., with some <lb/>disparity between the source and the target constructions such that the source just <lb/>partially sanctions the target (Langacker 1987: 69). The thickness of boxes indicates <lb/>entrenchment. Constructions of higher frequency are more entrenched than those of <lb/>lower frequencies (Langacker 2000). In this respect, [bi N hai A] and [Adverb A] are <lb/>the most entrenched ones here in the network. What is also worth pointing out about <lb/>this figure is the two bigger blue boxes which indicate the emergence of [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>from [bi N hai A] modeled on the emergence of [Adverb N] from [Adverb A]. <lb/>Obviously, the network as depicted in Figure 7, is the result of diachronic <lb/>changes. As we discussed in Section 3, what plays an important role in the buildup of <lb/>this network are &quot;frequency, entrenchment, and general cognitive abilities like <lb/>analogical reasoning [and] schematization&quot; (Smirnova and Sommerer 2020: 2). With <lb/>respect to schematization, Figure 7 brings a key issue to the front. That is, is it really <lb/>necessary to posit an overarching schematic construction such as [bi N hai X] in <lb/>Figure 7 (cf. Hilpert 2019)? From our preceding discussion, it is obvious that [bi N i hai <lb/>N i/j ] developed from [bi N hai A]. However, rather than vertical, the relation between <lb/>the constructions is lateral (and the nodes could be called &quot;sister nodes&quot;). This finding <lb/>also echoes Bloom&apos;s (2021) finding that &quot;the transfer of features from multiple <lb/>source constructions to a target construction not only happens when the source and <lb/>the target are taxonomically connected, but also takes place between associated <lb/>constructions at the same level of abstraction&quot;. If we assume that there is an over-<lb/>arching schematic construction, a follow-up question is what is its functionality <lb/>and when such a schema emerges? These questions still need further research. The <lb/>present study seems to suggest that it is at least after the emergence of [bi N i hai N i ] <lb/>that the schematic construction [bi N hai X] emerges as a generalization over the <lb/>horizontally-associated constructions [bi N hai A] and [bi N i hai N i ], and later also [bi <lb/>N i hai N j ]. <lb/>Finally, as Liu (2022: 294) points out, there is no consensus on the conceptual <lb/>ground or the nature of horizontal links among construction grammarians. Some <lb/>researchers (e.g., Cappelle 2006; Perek 2015; Van de Velde 2014; Zehentner and <lb/>Traugott 2020) posit that horizontally linked constructions are semantically con-<lb/>nected (similar semantics or distinct/opposite semantics), while others (e.g., Lorenz <lb/>2020) assume that constructions sharing formal properties are horizontally linked. <lb/></body>

        <note place="headnote">Liu et al. <lb/></note>

        <body>In the present study, however, the horizontally linked constructions [bi N hai A], <lb/>[bi N i hai N i ], and [bi N i hai N j ] have not only semantic similarity but also formal <lb/>similarity. In this sense, our study contributes to theory building in CxG. <lb/>6 Conclusions <lb/>The results of the present study show that at the origin of [bi N i hai N i ] lie multiple <lb/>sources. First, the construction [bi N i hai N i ] emerges by analogy with the conven-<lb/>tional comparative construction [bi N hai A], whereby the adoption of the scalar <lb/>meaning of A by a N, which is in essence non-scalar, can be ascribed to coercion. <lb/>What motivates this coercion is the noun&apos;s metonymic shift from &apos;entity&apos; to &apos;entity&apos;s <lb/>attributes&apos;. What may further have facilitated the extension from [bi N hai A] to [bi N i <lb/>hai N i ] is that the latter may have inherited the nominal feature from an already <lb/>existent construction [Adverb N]. Corroboration comes from a collexeme analysis we <lb/>carried out suggesting that the nouns most significantly attracted to [Adverb N] and <lb/>to [bi N i hai N i ] are semantically similar. At a more schematic level, the extension <lb/>A &gt; N observed in [bi N hai A] &gt; [bi N i hai N i ] may have been modeled (formally and <lb/>semantically) on the existing development in Mandarin from [Adverb A] to [Adverb <lb/>N]; this is also a shift-cum-coercion from scalar Adjective &gt; Noun. Analogical <lb/>extension and inheritance also underlie the subsequent development from [bi N i hai <lb/>N i ] (and indirectly also from [bi N hai A]) to [bi N i hai N j ]. <lb/>Methodologically, the study shows how collostructional analysis can benefit the <lb/>study of Mandarin comparative constructions. Theoretically, this study not only <lb/>showcases how language change (including node creation and network reconfigura-<lb/>tion) happens in a constructional network, but also demonstrates that in addition to <lb/>taxonomical relations between the source and the target constructions, lateral <lb/>relations also play an important role in language change. Furthermore, this case study <lb/>has shed light on the nature of horizontal links by revealing that constructions sharing <lb/>both formal and semantic features can be horizontally linked. Third, this study ex-<lb/>emplifies how a synchronically perceived relation between constructions (as between <lb/>[Adverb A] and [Adverb N]), which results from a diachronic change ([Adverb <lb/>A] &gt; [Adverb N]), may impact a later, similar language change (namely, [bi N hai A] &gt; [ bi <lb/>N i hai N i ]). Finally, it also contributes to usage-based Construction Grammar by <lb/>showing that, in addition to semantic similarity (see Bybee 2010: 36-37), semantic <lb/>contiguity (as instantiated, for instance, by metonymy) may motivate the sanctioning <lb/>of an item into the schematic slot of a construction (see the discussion of Figure 1). <lb/></body>
