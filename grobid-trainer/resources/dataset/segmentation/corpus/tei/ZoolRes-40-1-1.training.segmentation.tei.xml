			<front>ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH <lb/>2019 New Year Address of Zoological Research <lb/></front>

			<body>At the beginning of this new year full of exciting prospects and <lb/>potential, we would first like to share our exciting news that <lb/>Zoological Research (ZR) is now covered by Science Citation <lb/>Index Expanded (SCI-E), with full coverage to be backdated to <lb/>issue 1 in 2016. This encouraging progress demonstrates that <lb/>ZR has taken a critical step on the journey to becoming one of <lb/>the top journals in the field. <lb/>We would like to sincerely thank every author, reader, and <lb/>colleague of ZR. It is your enduring support and faith that has <lb/>helped in the sustained growth and advancement of ZR, which <lb/>continues to evolve as an important and influential journal. <lb/>Based on your contributions, the impact of ZR has maintained <lb/>a healthy increasing trend during 2018. In 2017, our Citescore <lb/>was 0.92 (Elsevier on 31 May 2018), thus ranking ZR within <lb/>the top 20% (161) of the 841 journals listed in the General <lb/>Medicine category. In addition, the mock impact factor of 2018 <lb/>(according to current data provided by the Web of Science) has <lb/>already exceeded that of 2017, up to 1.0. <lb/>Our current progress can also be attributed to the great <lb/>effort made in promoting the journal&apos;s influence. To ensure <lb/>that the journal provides up-to-date and valuable research <lb/>findings to academia, we insist on high-quality articles and <lb/>special issues/collections with support from our esteemed <lb/>authors and guest editors. Many recent feature articles have <lb/>attracted considerable attention from peers worldwide, e.g., <lb/>The role of wildlife (wild birds) in the global transmission <lb/>of antimicrobial resistance genes (2017, 38n2; Times cited: <lb/>13); Tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) as a novel laboratory <lb/>disease animal model (2017, 38n3; Times cited: 12); Creating <lb/>animal models, why not use the Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia <lb/>belangeri chinensis)? (2017, 38n3; Times cited: 12); Molecular <lb/>cloning, pathologically-correlated expression and functional <lb/>characterization of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor <lb/>(CSF-1R) gene from a teleost, Plecoglossus altivelis (2016, <lb/>37n2; Times cited: 11); Advances and perspectives in the <lb/>application of CRISPR/Cas9 in insects (2016, 37n4; Times <lb/>cited: 9); ZIKA -How fast does this virus mutate? (2016, <lb/>37n2; Times cited: 9); and numerous others (data from Web of <lb/>Science, 9 November 2018). <lb/>In 2018, four special issues were successfully released, i.e., <lb/>&quot;Special Issue for the Animal Model of Infectious Diseases&quot; <lb/>(39n1; guest editor: Yu-Hai Bi, Institute of Microbiology, <lb/>Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China), &quot;Herpetofaunal <lb/>Diversity in Indochina&quot; (39n3; guest editors: Nikolay A. <lb/>Poyarkov, Jr., Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia; <lb/>Jing Che, Kunming Institute of Zoology, CAS, China); &quot;Special <lb/>Issue for Primates and Primatology in China&quot; (39n4; guest <lb/>editor: Pengfei Fan, Sun Yat-Sen University, China); &quot;Mammal <lb/>Diversity in Asia&quot; (39n5; guest editors: Kai He, Kunming <lb/>Institute of Zoology, CAS, China; Masaharu Motokawa, Kyoto <lb/>University, Japan; Xue-Long Jiang, Kunming Institute of <lb/>Zoology, CAS, China), comprising authors from the US, <lb/>Canada, Russia, Belgium, Cambodia, Brazil, Thailand, and <lb/>others. <lb/>ZR has also maintained active and regular participation in <lb/>both academic and publication conferences, e.g., 1 st AsiaEvo <lb/>Conference, 8 th International Symposium on Primate Research, <lb/>Annual Conference of ScholarOne Users, and Development <lb/>Forum of Science, Technical and Medical (STM) Journals of <lb/>China. After successfully convening the Frontiers in Zoology <lb/>Symposium for the last two years, ZR will announce the next <lb/>symposium in February 2019 with the theme of &quot;Protection and <lb/>Utilization of Animal Resources&quot;. We hope to see many in <lb/>attendance at the conference, with all relevant information to be <lb/>found on the ZR homepage. <lb/>Importantly, ZR&apos;s editorial board members and generous <lb/>readers and authors have all performed their duties impeccably <lb/>and promoted the journal within academic institutes and to <lb/>colleagues both inside and outside of China. Our efforts <lb/>have paid off, with more than 60% of yearly peer reviewers <lb/>now located outside of China, and the database of reviewers, <lb/>authors, readers, homepage visitors, and WeChat followers <lb/>seeing significant expansion. We would like to thank all <lb/>the reviewers and editors for their patience and contributions, <lb/>which have greatly helped in maintaining the high-quality <lb/>manuscripts published in ZR. <lb/>Last but not the least, ZR has had nine new editorial boards <lb/>by the end of 2018. We are sincerely grateful for all the <lb/>hard work of each editorial board member in guaranteeing <lb/>the scientific value of the journal and maintaining its positive <lb/>roles in academia. The 10 th editorial board will commence <lb/>at the start of 2019 and includes 53 outstanding scientists <lb/>from 14 countries. To ensure a vibrant and effective team, we <lb/>encourage scholars with passion and ideas for cultivating ZR <lb/>into a more influential journal to join the team throughout the <lb/>year. If you are interested in working with our team, please do <lb/>not hesitate to contact us. <lb/>Scientific journals are of considerable value and strategic <lb/>significance. The Chinese government recently emphasized <lb/>that the development of scientific journals is critical for <lb/>advancing innovation in China, increasing the academic <lb/>influence of Chinese scientists among international peers, <lb/></body>

			<body>strengthening the nation&apos;s discursive power in promoting <lb/>international scientific and cultural communications, and <lb/>boosting the transformation and development of the scientific <lb/>publication industry in China. Ensuring the continuing vibrancy <lb/>and influence of Chinese scientific journals is not only the <lb/>expectation of generations of Chinese scientists and publishers, <lb/>but is also crucial for propelling scientific and technological <lb/>advancement. Among the 5 052 (as of 31 December 2017) <lb/>scientific/technology/medical journals of China, ZR is still <lb/>young; however, it has shown great vitality, considerable <lb/>potential, and a clear outlook in advancing the scientific spirit. <lb/>It is an exciting time for ZR as it grows, whilst remaining <lb/>adaptable, motivated, and open to new ideas. ZR will continue <lb/>to focus on publishing exciting results on: 1) Primates and <lb/>Animal Models; 2) Conservation and Utilization of Animal <lb/>Resources; and 3) Animal Diversity and Evolution. We further <lb/>hope for your enduring involvement into the future. ZR is <lb/>prepared to be challenged, stimulated, and inspired. Again, <lb/>thank you all!
