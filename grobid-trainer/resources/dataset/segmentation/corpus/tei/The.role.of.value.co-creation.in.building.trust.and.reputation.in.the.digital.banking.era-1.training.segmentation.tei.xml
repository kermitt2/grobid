			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Online banking allows customers to conduct more financial operations without going to physical <lb/>branches. customers play a more significant role in developing innovations (thomke &amp; hippel, 2002). <lb/>they have skills equal to those of the company&apos;s internal teams (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). <lb/>Moreover, customers can provide resources beyond purchases and financial contributions, such as knowl-<lb/>edge (harmeling et al., 2017). this makes the customer a pivotal actor in the online banking sector that <lb/>must be involved in the strategic process of value co-creation (agrawal &amp; rahman, 2015). Value co-creation <lb/>centres on active customer interaction with the company (Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008, 2011, 2016). this collab-<lb/>orative interaction creates value by integrating resources, such as customer knowledge and company <lb/>experience, leading to better products and services that are adjusted to customers&apos; needs (Prahalad &amp; <lb/>ramaswamy, 2004a). <lb/>however, the dematerialized world of the internet could still be a scary place for customers, especially <lb/>regarding people&apos;s savings and financial resources. therefore, studying value co-creation and its relation-<lb/>ships with customer trust and the company&apos;s reputation in an online bank environment is essential for <lb/>several reasons. this may empower banks to build stronger customer relationships, differentiate them-<lb/>selves in a competitive market, and ensure long-term success. Focusing on customer trust is the founda-<lb/>tion of any successful banking relationship, particularly in an online setting where customers may be <lb/></body>

			<body>concerned about security and privacy. Value co-creation fosters customer participation, collaboration, and <lb/>resource sharing, all contributing to trust-building between customers and banks. Further, a bank&apos;s rep-<lb/>utation is a crucial asset in the financial industry. Banks can enhance their reputation through value <lb/>co-creation by showcasing their commitment to customer satisfaction, innovation, and responsiveness to <lb/>customer needs (Oklevik et al., 2024). <lb/>although previous studies have the merit of increasing our knowledge of how customer value <lb/>co-creation occurs (kucharska, 2017; syah &amp; Olivia, 2022), also in online banking (aldás et al., 2009), <lb/>showing how customers&apos; trust in online settings and banks&apos; reputation may be pivotal in customer-bank <lb/>relations as a prerequisite for strategic value co-creation (Dhaigude et al., 2023; Mccormack &amp; Deacon, <lb/>2017), only a few studies focus on customers&apos; trust and company reputation as consequences of the <lb/>value co-creation process. <lb/>trust and company reputation have traditionally been viewed as antecedents that positively influence <lb/>customer value co-creation (Mostafa, 2020). additionally, some studies have explored the mediating role <lb/>of trust in the context of privacy risk and value co-creation (Wang et al., 2020). however, our research <lb/>shifts this perspective by demonstrating that effective value co-creation can enhance reputation and <lb/>trust. this, in turn, enables banks to adopt a customer-centric approach, offering tailored solutions and <lb/>fostering long-term relationships grounded in shared values and customer satisfaction (Oklevik et al., 2024). <lb/>We propose that customers&apos; trust and company reputation should be recognized as direct outcomes <lb/>of successful value co-creation strategies in the online banking environment. By embracing this innova-<lb/>tive perspective, our study addresses a critical gap in the literature. By conceptualizing Dart elements <lb/>as drivers, we investigate how these components directly influence trust and company reputation, both <lb/>essential for strategic success in the online banking sector. this novel approach aligns with the Dart <lb/>model&apos;s core principles and provides fresh insights into the intricate relationship between value co-creation <lb/>and its outcomes. <lb/>the aims of this study were twofold. First, it tests the Dart model (dialogue, access, risk assessment, <lb/>and transparency) as a driver of customer value co-creation (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). second, <lb/>this study investigates trust and reputation as the outcomes of value co-creation in online banking. <lb/>consequently, this study addresses the following research questions: (1) is the effect of dialogue, access, <lb/>risk assessment, and transparency on customer value co-creation significant in the banking industry? (2) <lb/>how is value co-creation related to customer trust and bank reputation? <lb/>this study uses exploratory factor analysis applying a Principal components analysis and sPss version <lb/>28 and sMart Pls version 4 software to check the model and evaluate the relationship between the <lb/>factors of the Dart model, value co-creation, company reputation, and customer trust. to do so, data <lb/>were collected through a survey, resulting in 217 valid questionnaires from online bank customers. thus, <lb/>this study makes two contributions. First, it tests the Dart model in the online banking industry and <lb/>shows that the original model also works in the banking industry. second, this study extends the mar-<lb/>keting literature by showing that value co-creation can generate reputation and trust as an outcome. <lb/>the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, a theoretical framework is presented in the <lb/>following sections, and the research hypotheses are developed. subsequently, this paper introduces the <lb/>model&apos;s empirical research methodology, measures, and tests. Finally, the results are presented and dis-<lb/>cussed, along with the theoretical and managerial implications, research limitations, and suggestions for <lb/>future research. <lb/>2. Theoretical background <lb/>2.1. Strategic value co-creation in the bank industry <lb/>the value creation process considers the joint efforts of actors in the dyad, actors benefiting themselves <lb/>while interacting and collaborating in the strategic process of value co-creation (Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008, <lb/>2011, 2016). the numerous interactions and outcomes of these activities can have a widespread impact <lb/>on the evolution of business strategies (gadde &amp; håkansson, 2011) because of the participatory role of <lb/>customers collaborating as innovators (amegbe et al., 2023; ramaswamy &amp; Ozcan, 2018). this practice <lb/>continues to develop, particularly with new interactive and information technologies. the nature of <lb/></body>

			<body>digital interactions, dynamic, synchronous, and changing, calls for special attention to co-creational activ-<lb/>ities and their measurement (royo-Vela &amp; Mariell Velasquez serrano, 2021). Value creation is based on <lb/>interaction, and value co-creation is defined as joint activities by actors involved in direct dyadic inter-<lb/>actions (grönroos &amp; ravald, 2011). this interaction among actors generates strategic experiences for <lb/>value creation (ramaswamy, 2008; suryadi et al., 2023). thus, customers can actively participate in both <lb/>service or product shaping and the perception and creation of value and experience based on the inter-<lb/>action (Vargo &amp; lusch, 2011). <lb/>thus, value creation has changed from a linear process across supply chains to value co-creation, in <lb/>which network actors interact and share resources assisted by digital and interactive technologies <lb/>(royo-Vela &amp; Mariell Velasquez serrano, 2021). Digital technologies like it platforms and mobile apps <lb/>allow banks to integrate complementary resources and capabilities and collaborate with customers to <lb/>co-create value (Mefoute Badiang &amp; nkwei, 2024). however, many banks aim for innovation as a strategic <lb/>outcome of value co-creation, as they lack innovative capabilities or tools (Ferguson &amp; hlavinka, 2007). <lb/>thus, banks must tap into customer creativity and objectivity (Yoo et al., 2010). accordingly, direct <lb/>bank-customer interaction is needed to strategically co-create value (andreu et al., 2010). additionally, <lb/>banks must implement a customer relationship approach to support strategic value co-creation (Payne <lb/>et al., 2008). <lb/>the banking industry uses advanced technology to provide consumers access to products and ser-<lb/>vices (Malar et al., 2019). the rise of digital technologies, such as virtual environments, has enabled banks <lb/>to have a closer and quicker relationship with their customers, making physical interactions obsolete <lb/>(Martovoy &amp; santos, 2012; royo-Vela et al., 2022). Besides technologies, market orientation helps banks <lb/>become closer to their customers (ind &amp; coates, 2013). hence, customers are invited to contribute toward <lb/>satisfying their needs. consequently, the relationship between banks and their customers is active, with <lb/>consumers perceiving usefulness when using the provider&apos;s services (grönroos, 2011). such dynamics <lb/>animate new customer needs and demands (hosseini et al., 2022). <lb/>Furthermore, customers&apos; expectations grow as much as effortlessly accessing the product and service <lb/>information offered by the internet. therefore, another market segment might easily detect an innova-<lb/>tion available in a small market segment (Mainardes et al., 2017). another aspect of online banking is <lb/>accessibility to consumers, as depicted by the constant sharing of ideas and value co-creation of new <lb/>tailor-made services strategically created from customers&apos; needs (akter et al., 2020; Oliveira &amp; Von <lb/>hippel, 2011). <lb/>When it comes to the advantages that strategic value co-creation brings to both consumers and <lb/>banks, direct interaction with the bank has a stronger relationship with customers, which, in turn, posi-<lb/>tively affects the bank&apos;s economic performance (e.g. operating cost reduction and higher return of invest-<lb/>ment) (Mainardes et al., 2017). in addition to financial performance, direct customer interaction has <lb/>fostered responsiveness to market changes in the banking industry. From the customer perspective, their <lb/>strategic involvement in the value co-creation process brings numerous benefits, such as lower bank <lb/>account charges, more accessible access to credit, and quicker customer care service (Jain &amp; Jain, 2015). <lb/>2.2. The DART model and the role of reputation and customer trust <lb/>When theorizing the Dart model, Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a) focused on the features of strategic <lb/>value co-creation and identified four variables: dialogue, which implies interactivity between the parties; <lb/>access, which promotes dialogue; risk assessment based on firm-customer pairing when deciding to <lb/>co-create; and transparency so that the information between the involved actors is symmetrical. Prahalad <lb/>and ramaswamy (2004a) highlight the necessity and importance of employing the Dart model for cus-<lb/>tomer strategic value co-creation, including elements characterizing firm-customer collaborative work. <lb/>the Dart model has been used in several sectors and settings. For example, using the Dart model, <lb/>russo spena et al. (2012) detected an intense exchange of information between customers and compa-<lb/>nies in the pop-up retail industry in italy. ramaswamy (2008) showed how nike sustained its competitive <lb/>advantages through a value co-creation strategy based on customers&apos; ideas to improve products and <lb/>their feelings when using them. several studies have tested the effectiveness of the Dart model. For <lb/>instance, albinsson et al. (2016) formulated 23 items to measure Dart variables of strategic value <lb/></body>

			<body>co-creation. these scholars surveyed 327 participants in two Us business schools and found a statistical <lb/>correlation. Finally, Mazur and Zaborek (2014) tested the Dart model on 30 indicators with 440 mid-level <lb/>managers from various companies (e.g. food and beverage, cosmetics manufacturing, hotels and accom-<lb/>modation, catering, and other tourism services). nevertheless, to our knowledge, studies have not yet <lb/>tested the Dart model in online banking (Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023). <lb/>Moreover, this study included reputation and trust to understand how they relate to the Dart model. <lb/>this study also aims to verify whether reputation and trust are the outcomes of customer value <lb/>co-creation in online banking. this study included reputation because it generates online endorsers <lb/>(Madden &amp; smith, 2010). however, few studies have directly related to co-creation and reputation. <lb/>Moreover, previous studies have neglected that reputation may occur due to value co-creation, leaving <lb/>a gap in the literature. For example, in Oreg and nov (2008) study, reputation motivates customers to <lb/>participate in strategic value co-creation because it increases people&apos;s desire to create notoriety and, <lb/>thereby, obtain the approval of others. in addition, a good reputation favours stakeholder engagement, <lb/>which is critical for customer value co-creation (abror et al., 2023; Dandis et al., 2021; nguyen et al., <lb/>2022). in particular, Oklevik et al. (2024) explored the intricate relationships between co-creation ele-<lb/>ments and customer engagement within various service industries, including banking. their study <lb/>emphasized the significance of the Dart model as a fundamental component driving brand experience <lb/>strength and satisfaction. <lb/>customer trust is another factor traditionally studied as an antecedent of value co-creation (Dhaigude <lb/>et al., 2023; Mccormack &amp; Deacon, 2017). For instance, Pavlou (2003) considered trust a fundamental <lb/>pillar of consumer behaviour in physical and online purchases. trust in the internet channel includes <lb/>specific attributes between firms and customers, such as perceived benevolence, capacity, competence, <lb/>honesty, integrity, credibility, predictability, and reliability, and other characteristics specific to the online <lb/>environment, such as security and privacy (grabner-kräuter &amp; Faullant, 2008). consequently, trust is <lb/>essential in online banking because risk perception is higher online than offline (cheung &amp; lee, 2001). <lb/>Furthermore, with internet banking, customers&apos; trust does not physically see the product or the person <lb/>carrying out the transactions. thus, generating trust in online users is vital as there is no personal con-<lb/>tact (Flavián &amp; guinalíu, 2005; lee, 2002). in addition, trust pushes internet users to recommend online <lb/>services, which turns trust into a viral marketing tool (li &amp; chen, 2009). therefore, trust leads to long-term <lb/>relationships because of emotional bonds (Frau et al., 2023a, 2023b). in conclusion, there is broad con-<lb/>sensus in the literature regarding the importance of trust in the value co-creation process. What is still <lb/>under discussion is whether trust is a consequence of value co-creation. <lb/>3. Research framework and hypotheses <lb/>a key variable explaining customer value co-creation is dialogue, which Prahalad and ramaswamy <lb/>(2004b, p.6) define as &quot;interactivity, engagement, and propensity to act -on both sides […] it implies <lb/>shared learning and communication between two equal problem solvers.&quot; Dialogue facilitates a two-way <lb/>interaction where firms and customers engage in mutual problem-solving and value creation. hoyer <lb/>et al. (2010) emphasize that dialogue is crucial for creating value and driving innovation. When custom-<lb/>ers are given a voice in the value co-creation strategy, they are more likely to contribute ideas and <lb/>feedback that enhance the value proposition (Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008). this participatory approach ensures <lb/>that the solutions developed are closely aligned with customer needs and preferences, leading to higher <lb/>perceived value. Moreover, dialogue fosters a sense of customer ownership and involvement, which is <lb/>essential for value co-creation. Beckers et al. (2018) suggest that when customers feel heard and valued, <lb/>they are more likely to engage in positive actions on social networks, enhancing brand equity and share-<lb/>holder value. this engagement is critical in social media, where customer interactions can significantly <lb/>influence public perception and brand reputation. While Frau et al. (2018) acknowledge that interacting <lb/>with customers and other stakeholders might sometimes decrease perceived value due to potential con-<lb/>flicts or misunderstandings, the overall impact of effective dialogue is positive. the Dart model identi-<lb/>fies dialogue as a fundamental element linking consumers to firms, emphasizing that meaningful <lb/>interactions can lead to better mutual understanding and collaboration (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). <lb/>Furthermore, effective dialogue helps build trust and long-term relationships, which are critical <lb/></body>

			<body>components of value co-creation. When companies actively listen to and act on customer feedback, they <lb/>demonstrate commitment and responsiveness, enhancing trust and fostering loyalty (Prahalad &amp; <lb/>ramaswamy, 2004a). this continuous feedback loop not only improves the immediate value co-creation <lb/>outcomes but also strengthens the foundation for ongoing collaboration and value enhancement. <lb/>therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: <lb/>H1: Dialogue positively influences the value co-created by customers. <lb/>the second variable considered in this research model is access, which has been conceptualized as <lb/>the ability of the value co-creation parties to obtain and use &quot;information and tools&quot; (Prahalad &amp; <lb/>ramaswamy, 2004b, p. 7). Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a) illustrate access to information with custom-<lb/>ers tracking production progress online without going to the factory. also, consumers need access to <lb/>relevant information to participate in production (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). this information is <lb/>valuable for a better relationship between customers and a company (garbarino &amp; strahilevitz, 2004). <lb/>according to sawhney et al. (2005), optimizing these tools through investments and technologies con-<lb/>tributes to efficient collaboration because it permits interactivity between the customer and the company. <lb/>the co-creation process sees the company as an experienced provider for the consumer, which moti-<lb/>vates said consumers to provide relevant information (grönroos &amp; ravald, 2011). thus, consumer partic-<lb/>ipation in strategic value co-creation occurs through exchanging information and constructing experiences <lb/>(Bolton &amp; saxena-iyer, 2009). the association between co-creation and active participation by consumers <lb/>implies more information about the company (cova &amp; Dalli, 2009). the disclosure of information by cus-<lb/>tomers leads to a better understanding of their relationships with the company (Moon et al., 2019). By <lb/>contrast, practices denying access to knowledge and information or disabling their exploitation may hin-<lb/>der strategic value co-creation (cabiddu et al., 2019). Based on these previous studies, the following <lb/>hypothesis was proposed: <lb/>H2: access to information positively influences the value co-created by customers. <lb/>the model considered risk assessment as the third variable, which refers to evaluating &quot;the proba-<lb/>bility of harm to the customer&quot; (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004b, p. 7). risk plays a significant role in <lb/>consumer behaviour, influencing information search and purchase decision-making (Masoud, 2013). <lb/>Despite recognizing the benefits of using the internet, consumers often feel uncertain about online <lb/>transactions, perceiving them as risky (lee &amp; tan, 2003). Perceived risk in online buying is defined as <lb/>the potential loss in pursuing a desired result, combining uncertainty and the possibility of severe <lb/>consequences (ko et al., 2004). this concept has been extensively studied, with various scales devel-<lb/>oped to measure perceived danger (Featherman &amp; hajli, 2016). high levels of perceived risk can sig-<lb/>nificantly reduce consumers&apos; willingness to purchase products online (Barnes et al., 2007). in online <lb/>commerce, perceived risk negatively impacts purchasing behaviour, attitudes towards usage, and the <lb/>intention to adopt online platforms (Zhou et al., 2008). Without a physical environment, customers <lb/>cannot directly assess product quality, engage in personal interactions, and feel secure about payment <lb/>processes. additionally, they face the costs of learning how to navigate online systems (Jain &amp; Jain, <lb/>2015). these factors contribute to the perception of online commerce as risky for some customers. <lb/>conversely, other consumers appreciate online commerce&apos;s advantages, such as real-time information <lb/>availability for product and price comparisons (san Martín &amp; camarero, 2009). Featherman and hajli <lb/>(2016) highlight that consumers are more concerned about perceived risks than usability when con-<lb/>tracting services online. this heightened concern about risk over usability indicates that risk assess-<lb/>ment is critical in shaping consumer behaviour in online environments. When consumers perceive high <lb/>levels of risk, they are less likely to engage in value co-creation activities, as their focus shifts towards <lb/>mitigating potential adverse outcomes rather than collaborating and innovating with firms. therefore, <lb/>practical risk assessment and mitigation are crucial for fostering value co-creation online. companies <lb/>must implement robust risk management strategies to alleviate customers&apos; concerns, enhancing their <lb/>willingness to participate in value co-creation processes. these strategies include ensuring secure pay-<lb/>ment systems, providing transparent information about products and services, and offering reliable <lb/>customer support. the literature indicates that perceived risk negatively influences consumer behaviour <lb/></body>

			<body>and attitudes in online commerce. given the importance of risk assessment in shaping these percep-<lb/>tions, we propose the following hypothesis: <lb/>H3: risk assessment negatively influences the co-creation of value by customers. <lb/>transparency has been conceptualized as the result of symmetric information-sharing processes <lb/>between customers and firms involved in strategic value co-creation (Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). <lb/>this concept emphasizes the importance of open and honest communication, where both parties <lb/>exchange information with equal clarity and accessibility. Ballantyne and Varey (2006) argue that custom-<lb/>ers require a degree of fair reciprocity in their dialogue with companies, meaning that the information <lb/>shared with consumers must be as clear and understandable as what they share with the organization. <lb/>this reciprocity builds trust and fosters a collaborative environment, which is essential for effective value <lb/>co-creation. consequently, companies can no longer operate with opaque pricing and profit margins <lb/>(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a). instead, they must ensure that information is accessible and transpar-<lb/>ent, providing customers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. garbarino and <lb/>strahilevitz (2004) highlight that information transparency offers a competitive advantage to companies, <lb/>as it enhances customer trust and engagement. customers who perceive that a company is transparent <lb/>are more likely to feel confident in their interactions and transactions. this confidence encourages greater <lb/>participation in co-creation activities, as customers are assured that their contributions are valued and <lb/>that they clearly understand the processes involved. transparency not only facilitates participation but <lb/>also enables continuous feedback. Open information channels allow customers to provide feedback on <lb/>products and services, which companies can use to make improvements and innovations. this ongoing <lb/>feedback loop enhances value co-creation by ensuring that the products and services align with cus-<lb/>tomer needs and preferences. Furthermore, transparency in information-sharing helps mitigate uncertain-<lb/>ties and reduces perceived risks associated with online transactions. When customers have clear and <lb/>accurate information about products, services, and company practices, they are less likely to perceive <lb/>high levels of risk, promoting a positive co-creation experience (Masoud, 2013). this reduced perceived <lb/>risk is crucial for fostering an environment where customers feel comfortable engaging in value <lb/>co-creation activities. transparency is vital in strategic value co-creation by promoting open communica-<lb/>tion, building trust, enabling continuous feedback, and reducing perceived risks. these elements are <lb/>essential for creating a collaborative environment where customers feel empowered to contribute to the <lb/>value co-creation process. therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: <lb/>H4: transparency positively influences the value co-created by customers. <lb/>considering the significance of reputation in the banking industry, it is crucial to explore the factors <lb/>influencing a company&apos;s reputation, including value co-creation. Value co-creation, as proposed by Vargo <lb/>and lusch (2008, 2011, 2016), is centred on active customer interaction with the company. this collabo-<lb/>rative interaction creates value, such as a reputation and personalized customer experiences (Prahalad &amp; <lb/>ramaswamy, 2004a). From this perspective, it is worth investigating whether the value co-creation pro-<lb/>cess between retail banks and their customers contributes to a more robust company reputation. <lb/>traditionally, company reputation has been studied as a determinant of value co-creation. scholars have <lb/>focused on examining the effective management of customer relationships, which results in a long-term <lb/>competitive advantage in the long term (nguyen et al., 2022). <lb/>conversely, pursuing a high company reputation may require increased investments in new it solu-<lb/>tions to maintain a competitive edge, potentially affecting short-term profits and hindering the economic <lb/>value generation from assets (eccles et al., 2007; nguyen et al., 2022). <lb/>consequently, a recent line of literature has shifted its perspective to analyzing value co-creation as <lb/>an antecedent of company reputation (Martillo Jeremías &amp; Polo Peña, 2021). For instance, recent studies <lb/>have demonstrated that customer value co-creation positively impacts a company&apos;s reputation by foster-<lb/>ing a customer-centric organizational culture and delivering enhanced customer experience (Foroudi <lb/>et al., 2019). a company&apos;s reputation is further solidified by fulfilling promises to stakeholders and meet-<lb/>ing their expectations (Ponzi et al., 2011). through customer value co-creation, companies can exhibit <lb/>their dedication to delivering value to customers and stakeholders, strengthening their reputation as <lb/></body>

			<body>customer-centric and responsible organizations (Martillo Jeremías &amp; Polo Peña, 2021). Ultimately, <lb/>co-creation initiatives empower customers to actively participate in the value-creation process, enabling <lb/>companies to tailor their offerings to meet specific customer needs and preferences, thus improving their <lb/>reputation (Pera et al., 2016). however, despite the importance of identifying antecedent variables of <lb/>reputation, such as value co-creation, a gap exists in the literature regarding how value co-creation pos-<lb/>itively influences banks&apos; company reputation. Based on these studies, the following hypothesis was <lb/>proposed: <lb/>H5: customer value co-created is positively related to company reputation. <lb/>customer trust, a fundamental belief in the dependability, honesty, or competence of a person or <lb/>entity, emerges as a crucial emotion resulting from the interaction between banks and their customers <lb/>during the value-formation process (Frau et al., 2023a, 2023b). customers trust service providers when <lb/>they are assured that their sensitive information remains secure (Parasuraman et al., 1985). to establish <lb/>trust, companies must commit to matters relevant to the customers&apos; value co-creation process and then <lb/>fulfil those commitments (Yap et al., 2010). <lb/>research indicates that higher customer co-creation increases trust between companies and their cus-<lb/>tomers (lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004). scholars support this view by suggesting that value co-creation sig-<lb/>nificantly influences trust because it helps mitigate risks arising from open information exchanges <lb/>between partners (ayuni &amp; engriani, 2019). companies create connections between their employees and <lb/>customers through value co-creation and work together in harmony. this involves not only listening to <lb/>customers but also taking action based on their suggestions (lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004). <lb/>a crucial aspect of value co-creation is communication between the parties involved, serving as a <lb/>platform for developing a shared understanding and exchanging knowledge related to each other&apos;s <lb/>activities, generating mutual trust (lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004). Based on these findings, the last hypoth-<lb/>esis of this study is as follows: <lb/>H6: customer value co-creation is positively related to trust. <lb/>From the analyzed literature and the six suggested hypotheses, we propose the following model of <lb/>online banking customers&apos; value co-creation towards reputation and trust development (see Figure 1). <lb/>4. Methodology <lb/>4.1. Population, sampling procedure and sample adequacy <lb/>the population must be consistent with the proposed study&apos;s objectives to ensure the research&apos;s effec-<lb/>tiveness. in the research context, the population is not finite, it is challenging to quantify, and it has over <lb/>100,000 units. it consists of customers who regularly use online banking services and have a stable <lb/>relationship with an important spanish bank, caixa Bank. 1 . the primary reasons for selecting this bank <lb/>include the proprietary nature of the information, the specific strategic initiatives of this bank in the <lb/>realm of value co-creation, and the depth of data we could access. this bank&apos;s unique practices provided <lb/>a rich context for addressing our research questions in detail. the respondents&apos; knowledge level limits <lb/>this sampling frame regarding the organization and the tools available for value co-creation. the survey <lb/>Figure 1.

Written informed consent for par-<lb/>ticipation in the study has been obtained. therefore, the final sample of 217 clients is not probabilistic, <lb/>although big enough to be proportional, as well as representative of the outlet&apos;s customers, as it meets <lb/>the criteria and weight of gender, age, educational level, income, and employment situation of the bank&apos;s <lb/>clients (see table 1). therefore, the sample was understood as non-probability judgmental sampling <lb/>(etikan &amp; Bala, 2017). <lb/>to determine whether this sample size was sufficient for the study&apos;s objectives, both chin&apos;s (1989) <lb/>minimum sample size criteria and the results of the applied power test using gPower 3.1, described later <lb/>in the section, confirmed a sufficient sample size. Data were collected through online questionnaires sent <lb/>to mobile phones during February and May 2022 and June-July 2023. <lb/>the key respondents were 62.08% males and 37.92% females. respondents were under the age of <lb/>sixty-five, and most of them were between 26 and 55 years old. in addition, most respondents had a <lb/>university degree or higher (77.43%). three-quarters of the sample is actively working. regarding average <lb/>income, 40.20% of those surveyed were within the range of 24,001-48,000 euros (see table 1). <lb/>4.2. Measurement scales <lb/>the survey included measures of the key constructs of the Dart model: dialogue, access, risk assess-<lb/>ment, and transparency. these form the second-order construct of value co-creation. a repeated indica-<lb/>tor procedure was applied (lohmöller, 1989). in addition, the survey comprised measurements of the <lb/>dependent constructs of trust and company reputation. each construct was measured with multiple <lb/>items using a five-point likert scale with anchors for all items (see tables 2-4). the questionnaire was <lb/>tested using a two-step process. First, two academics with more than 20 years of experience in academic <lb/>research conducted a semantic review of the questionnaire. they identified sentences that might confuse <lb/>or tax respondents&apos; patience. second, a convenience sample of 20 bank customers completed the ques-<lb/>tionnaire. they pinpointed all unclear, illogical, or problematic sentences to respond to. <lb/>Table 1.

Exploratory factor analysis <lb/>to identify the underlying structure of the dimensions, we performed an exploratory factor analysis by <lb/>applying a principal component analysis using sPss version 28. We subsequently checked the model <lb/>using the sMart Pls version 4 software (hair et al., 2019; ringle et al., 2022). We used partial least <lb/>squares (Pls) for two reasons. First, this study mainly aims to analyze the predictive capacity of a model <lb/>composed of two dependent constructs (company reputation and company trust) and maximize their <lb/>explained variance by one predictive variable: value co-creation, a second-order construct formed by the <lb/>variables dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency). second, a small sample size <lb/>was available, although it was sufficient. <lb/>Factor analysis showed an adequate and clear underlying factor structure that identified five factors <lb/>with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, which accounted for 77.16% of the variance.

			<body>of sampling adequacy was 0.89, exceeding the minimum threshold of 0.50, as proposed by kaiser (1974). <lb/>Before applying Pca, some items from the scales were dropped because the reliability and quantity of <lb/>items matter. in the Dialogue scale, items 3, 5, 6, and 7 were dropped; in the risk scale, item 3 and the <lb/>transparency scale, item 4 were also dropped. the composition of the components is shown in table 4. <lb/>as seen in table 4, the three items in the trust scale do not compose an individual factor because they <lb/>weigh in three other factors: accessibility, transparency and reputation. therefore, the access to informa-<lb/>tion factor is composed of four items, including trU1, which is composed of five items; the reputation <lb/>factor is composed of six items, including trU3; the risk factor is formed of five items, and four items, <lb/>including trU2, form the transparency. <lb/>this structure changes the previous conceptual model structure shown in Figures 1 and 2. now, the <lb/>latent variables&apos; access to information, Dialogue, risk and transparency measure the second-order con-<lb/>struct Value co-creation (VacOcre), and the latter affects reputation (see Figure 2). <lb/>4.4.

			<body>between the latent variables. as shown in table 6, this criterion was met by the data. in addition, we <lb/>ran the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (htMt) to test discriminant validity (henseler et al., 2015). all the <lb/>htMt ratios in absolute value were below the threshold of 0.90, even below 0.85, which indicated that <lb/>discriminant validity exists between the reflective factors (see table 6). <lb/>these results indicate satisfactory reliability and convergent and discriminant validity of the measure-<lb/>ment model&apos;s variables and constructs. <lb/>5. Results <lb/>to assess the structural model, we observed the dependent latent variable variance, explained by the <lb/>predictive factor. the criterion to apply is r 2 , which must be higher than 0.1 (Falk &amp; Miller, 1992). in <lb/>addition to r 2 , we checked the significance of the path coefficients using their respective t-values (hair <lb/>et al., 2012). Finally, we assessed the cross-validated redundancy index (Q 2 ) by blindfolding (geisser, <lb/>1975), which, together with r 2 , informed on the predictive capacity of endogenous factors, with values <lb/>above zero, indicated a clear predictive relevance of the model (chin, 1998; see table 6). the ViF indica-<lb/>tor for the inner model is less than five and higher than 0.20, which is the recommended range accord-<lb/>ing to hair et al. (2011). specifically, the ViF for the independent constructs is 1.496 (accinF), 1.768 <lb/>(DialOgUe), 2.645 (risk), and 1.970 (transParencY); all values are less than 3, which is ideal, according <lb/>to hair et al. (2019). therefore, collinearity between the independent constructs was not observed. <lb/>the empirical results support four hypotheses about customer value co-creation and one about the <lb/>effects of value co-creation on company reputation and trust (see Figure 3 and table 7). the first four <lb/>hypotheses are as follows: h1 (β = 0.291; p &lt; 0.001) shows that dialogue significantly and positively influ-<lb/>ences customer value co-creation. the same is true for h2, where access to information significantly and <lb/>positively explains customer value co-creation (β = 0.230; p &lt; 0.001). in the case of h3, risk assessment, <lb/>insofar as it implies information to be able to assess the risk of the financial service product adequately, <lb/>positively influences value co-creation (β = -0.394; p &lt; 0.001), with the variable having the highest effect <lb/>on value co-creation. h4 shows transparency positively affects customer value co-creation (β = 0.301; <lb/>p &lt; 0.001). Finally, regarding h5, the results show that value co-creation affects reputation and trust in a <lb/>company (β = 0.769; p &lt; 0.001). <lb/>regarding the proposed model and its predictive capacity, both r2, with a value of 0.591 and a Q2 <lb/>of 0.580, show an explicit model predictive capacity. these results support that customer value co-creation <lb/>in the banking sector has a relevant impact on a company&apos;s reputation and trust development. <lb/>6. Discussion <lb/>studying dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, transparency, customer trust, and bank repu-<lb/>tation is critical to understanding customer value co-creation in the bank setting. such factors are espe-<lb/>cially paramount nowadays because customers can see bank operations in real time and have access to <lb/>a personal manager through their mobile devices. <lb/>6.1. Theoretical implications <lb/>regarding the research questions, this study makes two key contributions to the test and extant theory <lb/>on customer strategic value co-creation in the banking context. <lb/>First, when conceptualizing the Dart model, Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a) considered dialogue, <lb/>access, risk assessment, and transparency as the fundamental pillars that allow the customer to co-create <lb/>Table 6.

			<body>strategic value with the company, keeping open the opportunity to further studies enriching their model <lb/>with additional and industry-specific variables. this study attempts to extend the Dart model by involv-<lb/>ing two significant strategic variables for customer value co-creation in the online banking industry: trust <lb/>and reputation. the findings reveal that value co-creation significantly affects a company&apos;s reputation <lb/>and trust. therefore, this study supports the notion that the customer value co-creation process can <lb/>develop a company&apos;s reputation and trust. Previous research has contributed in various ways to our <lb/>understanding of customer value co-creation (kucharska, 2017; syah &amp; Olivia, 2022) and online banking <lb/>(aldás et al., 2009). For instance, it highlights the significance of customers&apos; trust in online settings and <lb/>banks&apos; reputations as essential prerequisites for strategic value co-creation (Dhaigude et al., 2023; <lb/>Mccormack &amp; Deacon, 2017). Oklevik et al. (2024) also underscored the importance of the Dart model <lb/>elements in enhancing customer-brand interactions, providing a foundational understanding that further <lb/>supports the role of trust and reputation as outcomes of value co-creation. <lb/>Figure 3. the structural model. <lb/>Table 7.

			<body>Furthermore, studies have shown that trust and company reputation are antecedents that positively <lb/>influence customer value co-creation (e.g. Mostafa, 2020). additionally, researchers have explored how <lb/>trust mediates relationships with factors such as privacy risk, concern, and value co-creation (Wang et al., <lb/>2020). in contrast, our study extends the existing literature by demonstrating that constructive and col-<lb/>laborative relationships, along with resource integration, arise from the positive management of dia-<lb/>logue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency between the bank and customers during <lb/>the value co-creation process. these factors foster long-term relationships and build customer trust and <lb/>reputation. consequently, customers&apos; trust and company reputation can be seen as direct outcomes of a <lb/>successful value co-creation strategy in online banking. <lb/>in conclusion, building upon the original Dart model and existing research on the relationships <lb/>between customer trust, company reputation, and customer value co-creation, this article contributes to <lb/>the strategic marketing literature by highlighting that the value co-creation process can yield reputation <lb/>and trust as outcomes. traditionally, trust and company reputation have been seen as antecedents that <lb/>positively impact customer value co-creation (Mostafa, 2020). Our research, however, shifts this perspec-<lb/>tive by showing that effective value co-creation can enhance reputation and trust. consequently, we <lb/>propose that customers&apos; trust and company reputation should be recognized as direct outcomes of suc-<lb/>cessful value co-creation strategies in online banking. By adopting this innovative approach, our findings <lb/>offer fresh insights into the complex relationship between value co-creation and its outcomes. <lb/>second, the Dart model has been studied in several settings. For example, the Dart model has been <lb/>employed in the pop-up retail sector in italy (russo spena et al., 2012) and the fashion industry, showing <lb/>how nike co-created strategic value with customers (ramaswamy, 2008). however, there is a lack of <lb/>studies that employ the Dart model in banks (Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023), especially in the online banking <lb/>setting. therefore, this study suggests four hypotheses for testing the Dart model in an online bank <lb/>setting. hypotheses involving dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency are <lb/>accepted. thus, the present study&apos;s findings show that the Dart model works successfully in the online <lb/>banking industry. this result extends the current literature that tested the Dart model in an offline <lb/>context (e.g. Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023). therefore, this study provides a broader vision of the Dart model, <lb/>including banks&apos; online customers. <lb/>6.2. Management implications <lb/>Vale co-creation is pivotal to online banking. therefore, this study provides managerial and strategic <lb/>suggestions for each variable involved in the Drat model: customer trust and bank reputation. <lb/>Dialogues require active attitudes from both customers and banks. From the banks&apos; point of view, as <lb/>a minimum requirement, they must inform customers about products and services at the time of their <lb/>launch. however, a more advanced practice requires banks to encourage customers to participate in the <lb/>product innovation process, clearly informing them of their role in innovation and their benefits. this will <lb/>efficiently impact customers&apos; co-creation engagement and increase value. <lb/>access refers to tools and information that facilitate collaboration in strategic value co-creation. For <lb/>this reason, banks must provide sufficient means for customers to facilitate collaboration. For example, <lb/>banks may invest in digital platforms to allow customers to collaborate remotely in the innovation pro-<lb/>cess without going to the bank&apos;s office. in addition, banks may develop procedures to allow customers <lb/>to collaborate whenever they want. <lb/>risk assessment is based on identifying, analyzing, and controlling unforeseen events that may arise <lb/>when co-creating. therefore, banks must identify what customers recognize as risky in collaboration. <lb/>Banks need to take action to resolve each customer-perceived unsafe aspect of the collaboration and <lb/>quantify the possibility that unforeseen events occur and their impact on co-creation. Banks may also be <lb/>proactive in quantifying the possibility of unforeseen risky events to guarantee a smooth value co-creation <lb/>strategic process with customers. <lb/>transparency, which refers to information equality between the customer and company, occurs when <lb/>banks strategically communicate the value they aim to gain in the collaborative process. this also means <lb/>being open to consumer criticism, which requires negotiation. thus, banks must be ready to be asked <lb/>and share collaboration and project development data. <lb/></body>

			<body>Finally, dialogue, access, risk assessment, and transparency are crucial in promoting online value <lb/>co-creation. additionally, marketing planners must consider that successfully managing the value <lb/>co-creation process results in greater customer trust and bank reputation. thus, developing reliability <lb/>policies based on best collaboration practices and banks&apos; ability to place customers in the centre of value <lb/>co-creation processes increases bank reputation and customer trust. <lb/>6.3. Limitations and future lines of research <lb/>this study shows findings from an underexplored perspective of online-back customers. While it demon-<lb/>strates the key role that Dart variables play in customer value co-creation and how it results in cus-<lb/>tomer trust and bank reputation, it also has a few limitations. <lb/>this study was based on homogeneous survey respondents. For example, data collection is based <lb/>on customers from only one bank, caixa Bank, and only one country, spain. We acknowledge that <lb/>collecting data from a single bank limits the generalizability of our findings. We discuss the potential <lb/>biases introduced by this approach. this enhanced discussion aims to give readers a clearer under-<lb/>standing of the study&apos;s boundaries and encourage future research to build upon our findings with a <lb/>broader dataset. <lb/>Note <lb/>1. according to the magazine global Finance, caixabank has been the First bank in spain for the last eight years <lb/>and the best West european bank for the fourth time in 2022 (Press notice, caixa bank, 13/04/2022; http:// <lb/>www.ciaxabank.com/comunicacion/noticia/caixabank-elegido-mejor-banco-en-espana-2022-y-mejor-ban <lb/>co-en-europa-occidental-2022-por-la-revista-global-finance_es). <lb/></body>
