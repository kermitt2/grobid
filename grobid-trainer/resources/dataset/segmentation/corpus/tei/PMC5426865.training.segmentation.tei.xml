			<front>www.PRSGlobalOpen.com <lb/>1 <lb/>VIDEO <lb/>Operative Technique <lb/>I <lb/>n Asian rhinoplasty, for patients who mostly have low <lb/>and small noses compared to Caucasians, the most fre-<lb/>quently performed procedures are nasal tip projection, <lb/>lengthening and augmentation. <lb/>Various alloplastic materials such as silicone, polytet-<lb/>rafluoroethylene, high-density polyethylene (Medpor, <lb/>Stryker), etc., have been applied for such operations even <lb/>until recently. 1,2 However, when these implants are used <lb/>improperly or cause infection, it may result in severe con-<lb/>tracture that is very hard to correct. <lb/></front>

			<body>STEPS <lb/>1. Dermofat graft is harvested from sacral area. <lb/>2. The soft-tissue skin envelope (STSE) is elevated su-<lb/>perficially from the scar tissue as evenly as possible. <lb/>3. All the alloplastic materials are removed. <lb/>4. The alar cartilage is made by complete release of <lb/>the scar tissue or the support structure that has been <lb/>holding the tip structure firmly. <lb/>5. Alar cartilage compound is fixed without tension to <lb/>proper location using extension or spreading grafts. <lb/>6. Dorsal augmentation with dermofat graft. <lb/>7. Tip plasty by shield graft and cap graft with conchal <lb/>cartilage and reinforcing nasal tip with a piece of <lb/>dermofat. <lb/>OPERATIVE TIPS <lb/>See Video 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which <lb/>demonstrates elevation of skin and soft-tissue envelope <lb/>(STSE) superficially from the scar tissue, and removal of <lb/>alloplastic materials. This video is available in the &quot;Related <lb/>Videos&quot; section of the Full-Text article on PRSGlobalO-<lb/>pen.com or available at http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/A412. <lb/>In this video case, which is secondary rhinoplasty, I cor-<lb/>rect the contracted nose with dermofat graft and conchal <lb/>cartilage graft as autologous material. The video demon-<lb/>strates STSE elevation and Medpor that was applied for <lb/>septal extension, and spreading is removed. The second <lb/>video displays scar tissue, and alar cartilage compound <lb/>is sufficiently released from surrounding contracted scar <lb/>and upper lateral cartilage. 3 (See Video 2, Supplemental <lb/>Digital Content 2, which shows the free movement of the <lb/>alar cartilage, without tension, after complete release of <lb/>the scar tissue or the support structure and the rebuilding <lb/>of the nasal tip with derotation type dorsal batten graft. <lb/>This video is available in the &quot;Related Videos&quot; section of <lb/>the Full-Text article on PRSGlobalOpen.com or available <lb/>at http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/A413.) When destruction <lb/>or deformity of alar cartilage is extreme with severe scar <lb/>formation, it should be released as the alar compound with <lb/>certain shape and volume rather than trying to separate <lb/>the scar from alar cartilage completely. Septal cartilage <lb/>is not harvested concerning instability of caudal septum <lb/>where Medpor was applied. Extended alar compound is <lb/>fixed by derotation type dorsal batten graft 4 using conchal <lb/>cartilage. <lb/>The third video shows dermofat graft being harvest-<lb/>ed mostly from sacral region where the thickest dermis <lb/>can be obtained 5 and is molded into a suitable shape by <lb/>molding sutures. By such molding technique that is in-<lb/>troduced by Dr. Jo, Korean plastic surgeon, not only the <lb/>most suitable shape can be achieved but also substantial <lb/></body>
