			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Legal and regulatory issues often receive only brief attention <lb/>during medical training, given the significant competing <lb/>curriculum. Medical institutions and insurance companies <lb/>may educate physicians on potential liability, but the <lb/>curriculum is designed to focus on the knowledge most <lb/>important to protect the medical institution and insurance <lb/>company, rather than the physician. While this will often <lb/>overlap with protection of the individual, that is not always the <lb/>case. This note will overview the ways a physician may face <lb/>trouble. The purpose is to raise awareness so that one may <lb/>come out unscathed (or at least, less scathed). <lb/>TRADITIONAL TROUBLE: THE LAWSUIT <lb/>Even the most conscientious, well-trained, and competent <lb/>gastroenterologist is at risk of becoming a defendant in a <lb/>lawsuit. A malpractice suit can be initiated with relative ease <lb/>and a low evidentiary requirement in most states. Although <lb/>most doctors-approximately 80%-will eventually prevail, a <lb/>lawsuit is a stressful process regardless of the outcome, and <lb/>may lead to personal loss of self-esteem, depression, family <lb/>stress, credentialing issues, and financial worry. The fear of <lb/>being subjected to a lawsuit is pervasive in medicine, and may <lb/>affect how a physician practices (i.e., defensive medicine). The <lb/>angst is perhaps more proportionate to the perception of the <lb/>pain and humiliation associated with the process and <lb/>character of a lawsuit than to the frequency of occurrence. <lb/>When faced with a malpractice lawsuit, the physician must <lb/>take the suit seriously, should generally seek legal advice, and <lb/>must abide by the following principles: <lb/>1. Never alter the medical record. It is not only unethical, but <lb/>against your interest, as the record has already been <lb/>copied for the plaintiff&apos;s attorney. <lb/>2. Do not discuss the case with your colleagues, who may be <lb/>subpoenaed to testify as to the content of your conversation. <lb/>3. Consider and ask your insurance company-provided <lb/>attorney whether there are any conflicts of interest in that <lb/>attorney&apos;s representation of you. If so, you may need an <lb/>independent attorney to represent solely your interests. <lb/>4. Consider the importance of your demeanor; do not appear <lb/>arrogant, demeaning, or unprepared. <lb/>5. Deposition tips: be well prepared. Reread the medical <lb/>record thoroughly, research the medical problem at issue, <lb/>and have it down cold. Don&apos;t rush. <lb/>6. If asked whether certain texts, journals, or guidelines are <lb/>the accepted authorities in the field, be sure to qualify any <lb/>affirmative answer that no one source is the sole authority. <lb/>A complete analysis of the above principles can be found in <lb/>our review article for gastroenterologists &quot; What to do if sued&quot;. 1 <lb/>STATE MEDICAL BOARD (SMB) <lb/>The SMB is the state agency responsible for licensing <lb/>and regulating physician behavior. The primary goals of the <lb/>SMB are to protect the public from physicians considered <lb/>unfit to practice. The SMB is responsible for receiving or <lb/>gathering information that might indicate unfitness for practice, <lb/>and then undertaking an investigation to verify the information. <lb/>The SMB can (1) restrict or remove the physician&apos;s <lb/>license; (2) require that the physician completes a remedial <lb/>program to maintain his or her license; and (3) list the <lb/>complaint and the decision on its publically searchable <lb/>website for further transparency. This SMB public listing is <lb/>often linked to various doctor-rating sites that may increase the <lb/>availability of the adverse finding and affect the doctor&apos;s public <lb/>persona. <lb/>The SMB may act upon information received from a variety <lb/>of sources, including the following: <lb/>1. A complaint about a physician directly to a SMB. While in <lb/>many cases the complaint is made for legitimate reasons, it <lb/>could also come from a disgruntled patient, a concerned <lb/>colleague, or some other motivated member of the public. <lb/>2. Malpractice actions against the physician are reported to <lb/>the SMB for review and may be a cause for them to act. <lb/>3. Restrictions of hospital privileges or discipline by the <lb/>medical institution in which the physician works can be <lb/>reported to the SMB, and in many instances there are <lb/>mandatory reporting requirements in place. <lb/></body>

			<body>Gastroenterologists should take complaints or actions by <lb/>the SMB as seriously as with a lawsuit. When responding to <lb/>such actions, it is important to take time to accurately represent <lb/>your point of view and to strongly consider legal representation <lb/>to guide you in answering for any serious complaint. <lb/>FORMAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM <lb/>(PIP) <lb/>We all strive towards practicing high-quality compassionate <lb/>medicine. Nevertheless, during a physician&apos;s career, an event <lb/>may occur that raises questions in colleagues&apos; minds about <lb/>that physician&apos;s performance. Generally, detailed and thought-<lb/>ful conversations and mentoring by team leaders along with <lb/>that physician&apos;s willingness to accept accurate criticisms and <lb/>modify behavior as necessary will lead to resolution of the <lb/>issue with informal processes. <lb/>In some circumstances, particularly if the severity of the issue <lb/>merits, the physician will be required to engage in a formal PIP. <lb/>This program might involve attending required educational <lb/>classes, proctoring of procedures, and being mentored. A formal <lb/>PIP has a dual purpose: (1) to get the physician&apos;s attention and <lb/>improve the physician&apos;s performance to a satisfactory level, and <lb/>(2) document the institutional warning and any difficulty or <lb/>inability the physician has to meet standards. The institution is <lb/>therefore in a better position to show cause to fire a physician <lb/>who fails or refuses to achieve target standards. <lb/>A response to a formal PIP is a delicate balance. You want to <lb/>demonstrate willingness to improve on the concerns raised <lb/>and not seem overly defensive or resistant. However, it is also <lb/>important to take care to not admit fault, where it is ambiguous, <lb/>and as a result have your own admission held against you. <lb/>Take the process seriously and understand where improve-<lb/>ments need to be made. Neutral third parties and mentors can <lb/>be helpful, especially if your view and the institution&apos;s view of <lb/>the problem differ markedly. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>Health-care providers generally achieve their goals of <lb/>providing competent and compassionate care. Nevertheless, <lb/>a misstep, or perceived error, can begin a cascade of <lb/>adverse actions. Understanding how &quot;trouble can come at <lb/>you&quot; may help prevent issues, or guide you through troubled <lb/>waters. <lb/></body>
