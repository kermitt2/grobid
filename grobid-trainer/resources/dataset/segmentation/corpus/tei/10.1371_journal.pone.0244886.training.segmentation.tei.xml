A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 <lb/>was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being nega-<lb/>tive and 1-8 being positive.

Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-<lb/>SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admis-<lb/>sion with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-<lb/>1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int <lb/>was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and <lb/>PLOS ONE <lb/>PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244886 January 5, 2021 <lb/>1 / 11 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>OPEN ACCESS <lb/>Citation: Kaleemi R, Hilal K, Arshad A, Martins RS, <lb/>Nankani A, TU H, et al.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>With the outbreak of an unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new <lb/>human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), roused <lb/>the attention of the entire world. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the potentially fatal <lb/>disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization <lb/>in March 2020 [1]. <lb/>As the pandemic unfolds, healthcare systems worldwide continually seek to determine the <lb/>role of imaging in the diagnostics, management, and prognostication of COVID-19. The use <lb/>of ultrasound (US) has been explored previously in the diagnostics of other infectious diseases <lb/>[2]. Some studies have considered the emerging role of portable US imaging of the lungs in <lb/>COVID-19 detection, describing ultrasound findings such as B-lines, consolidation and thick-<lb/>ened pleural lines [3]. However, US has its limitations, as it is highly operator-dependent and <lb/>difficult to perform in patients with severe disease in an intensive care unit (ICU) set-up. <lb/>Moreover, the specificity of ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 presenting with early dis-<lb/>ease has also proven to be significantly lower as compared to chest x-ray and computerized <lb/>tomography scans [4]. The utility of CT (computerized tomography) scans for COVID-19 <lb/>imaging is being extensively explored [5]. However, the sheer influx of suspected and con-<lb/>firmed COVID-19 cases presenting to hospitals means that there is a major burden on radiol-<lb/>ogy departments, posing immense challenges for infection control in the CT suite. The <lb/>American College of Radiology notes that CT decontamination required after scanning <lb/>patients with COVID-19 may disrupt radiological service availability, and suggests that porta-<lb/>ble chest x-ray (CXR) may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection [6]. <lb/>Additionally, while CT scans have a good sensitivity in detecting subtle changes due to <lb/>COVID-19, their cost and other practical considerations limit their utility in developing coun-<lb/>tries such as Pakistan [7-9]. In Pakistan, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has <lb/>crossed 395,000 as of 29 th November 2020, and the country is entering a second wave of <lb/>COVID-19 infections [10]. At the Aga Khan University Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in <lb/>Pakistan, patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 symptoms <lb/>are assessed with a baseline set of investigations that include RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase <lb/>polymerase chain reaction) and CXR. Plain film radiography of the chest (CXR) is relatively <lb/>inexpensive and is widely available as an imaging modality in the smaller healthcare centers of <lb/>Pakistan. Though the radiographic features of CXRs in patients with COVID-19 have been <lb/>described [11], there is a scarcity of literature discussing the association of CXR findings with <lb/>clinical outcomes, particularly in our setting. Thus, in this article we aim to describe our expe-<lb/>rience of CXR imaging in patients with COVID-19, and explore the association between CXR <lb/>findings and clinical outcomes. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and methods <lb/>Setting and sample selection <lb/>This retrospective study was conducted between 28 th February-31 st May 2020 at the Aga Khan <lb/>University Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. For this retrospective study, ethical <lb/>approval was obtained from the institutional review board of the Aga Khan University Hospi-<lb/>tal (Reference Number: 2020-4774-10611). We were granted a waiver of informed consent as <lb/>this was a retrospective study and all patients were discharged from the hospital. No personal <lb/>identifiers were included in data collection, and records were anonymized to the statistician. <lb/>Adult patients (� 18 years) of either sex who presented to the emergency department with sus-<lb/>pected COVID-19 based on clinical symptoms (fever, dry cough, dyspnea etc.), travel history, <lb/>or positive RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), were considered for <lb/>inclusion. Patients were enrolled if they were positive for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR and <lb/>underwent CXRs. Any patient with a known history of any other pulmonary infection, or who <lb/>was already admitted to the hospital due to some other disease, was excluded from the study. <lb/>Data collection <lb/>Patients&apos; data collected included clinical data accessed through the online patient care records <lb/>and radiographic data as follows: <lb/>• Clinical Data: These included demographics and pre-existing comorbids (diabetes, hyper-<lb/>tension, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, etc.) for all patients. For inpatients, additional <lb/>variables included intensive care unit (ICU) admission with intubation (ICU-Int), hospital <lb/>outcome (mortality vs. healthy on discharge/left against medical advice/discharged on <lb/>request), and hospital length of stay (LOS). <lb/>• Radiographic Data: Two senior radiologists, with experience of more than 8 years in chest <lb/>imaging, reviewed the initial and follow-up CXRs of all patients in the study. In cases of dis-<lb/>agreement, further review by a third radiologist, who had more than 10 years of experience, <lb/>was obtained. Radiographic features described through consensus of the radiologists <lb/>included laterality, centrality, zonal location, and type of infiltrates. All radiologists were <lb/>blinded as to the diagnosis and current clinical condition of the patient. <lb/>Radiograph severity scoring <lb/>For quantitative measurement of extent of pulmonary involvement, a CXR Severity Score <lb/>(CXR-SS) was calculated by adapting and simplifying the Radiographic Assessment of Lung <lb/>Edema (RALE) score proposed by Warren et al. [12]. A score of 0-4 was assigned to each lung <lb/>depending on the extent of involvement by consolidation or alveolar/interstitial infiltrates <lb/>(0 = no involvement; 1 = &lt;25%; 2 = 25-50%; 3 = 50-75%; 4 = &gt;75% involvement). The scores <lb/>for each lung will be summed to produce the final CXR-SS out of a maximum of 8 (11) . An <lb/>example of the application of this scoring system is shown in Fig 1. A total score of 0 was con-<lb/>sidered as negative, while any score from 1-8 was considered as positive. This CXR Severity <lb/>Score has been used before to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection in COVID-19 [11]. <lb/>We adopted this scoring system to evaluate its prognostic value for clinical outcomes of <lb/>COVID-19 in our setting. For the purpose of analysis, we used the patients&apos; initial CXR-SS and <lb/>highest CXR-SS. The initial CXR-SS was the score given to the patients&apos; first CXR upon pre-<lb/>sentation to the hospital. The highest CXR-SS was the score with the greatest value amongst all <lb/>the CXRs of a patient during their hospital course, which included both initial and subsequent <lb/></body>

			<body>serial CXRs. Using the highest CXR-SS reduces heterogeneity, as it gives us a set standard of <lb/>the maximum pulmonary involvement as seen on CXR to compare patients&apos; outcomes against. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>All analyses were performed on IBM SPSS v. 21. Continuous data was presented as mean and <lb/>standard deviation, and compared using independent sample t-tests. CXR Severity Scores <lb/>were compared using Mann-Whitney U-Tests. Categorical data was presented as frequencies <lb/>and percentages, and compared using Chi-squared tests. Spearman&apos;s correlations were used to <lb/>investigate the correlations of continuous variables with CXR-SS. Univariate and multivariable <lb/>logistic regression was performed with the dependent variables being initial CXR result (posi-<lb/>tive), initial CXR-SS (5-8), mortality, and ICU-Int. The multivariable models included age, <lb/>gender, and variables with a p-value &lt; 0.25 on univariate analysis. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was con-<lb/>sidered significant for all analyses. <lb/>Results <lb/>A total of 150 patients were included in this study, with the majority being male (76.7%). The <lb/>mean age was 56.1 years, with ages ranging from 23-83 years. The commonest comorbids in <lb/>our patients were hypertension (HTN: 46.7%) and diabetes mellitus (T2DM: 37.3%). A posi-<lb/>tive initial CXR result (CXR Severity Score &gt; 0) was seen in 120 (80%) of patients. The mean <lb/>initial CXR-SS was 3.32 ± 2.53. The majority of patients were admitted to the hospital (96%), <lb/>and amongst these 30.6% were admitted to the ICU and intubated. While 72.2% of patients <lb/>were healthy on discharge, 11.1% left without medical advice or were discharged on request. A <lb/>mortality rate of 16.7% was observed in admitted patients. Patients with a positive initial CXR <lb/>result were significantly older than those with a negative initial CXR result (58.5 ± 13.75 years <lb/>Fig 1. CXR patterns.

Additionally, a significantly higher percentage of <lb/>patients with positive initial CXR results were admitted in the ICU and intubated, as compared <lb/>to those with negative initial CXR (34.5% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.037). The initial CXR-SS was also <lb/>the highest CXR-SS in 56% of patients, while the highest CXR-SS of the remaining patients <lb/>was seen on subsequent serial CXRs. In our study, 15 (10%) of patients were labeled with the <lb/>code &quot;do-not-resuscitate&quot; (DNR), whilst the rest were labeled full-code. Amongst the patients <lb/>labeled DNR, 10 (66.7%) expired and 3 (20%) were discharged on request/left against medical <lb/>advice. The patients labeled DNR had a significantly greater mean age (63.40 ± 15.47 years vs. <lb/>55.32 ± 14.84 years; p = 0.049), initial CXR-SS (5.00 ± 2.56 vs. 3.19 ± 2.47; p = 0.008), and high-<lb/>est CXR-SS (6.87 ± 1.64 vs. 4.59 ± 2.64; p &lt; 0.001) than those labeled full code. Details of <lb/>patients&apos; demographics and hospital course are shown in Table 1. <lb/>Males had a significantly greater highest CXR-SS than females (4.98 ± 2.66 vs. 3.83 ± 2.62; <lb/>p = 0.023), as well as a higher mortality rate, though this was not statistically significant (20% <lb/>vs. 5.9%; p = 0.054). <lb/>The majority of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 0-4 (69.3%), whereas 52% of patients <lb/>had a highest CXR-SS between 5-8. On initial CXR, the vast majority of patients showed bilateral <lb/>(92%) infiltrates, and these were peripherally located in 81.3% of patients. Infiltrates on initial <lb/>CXR were most commonly located in the lower zone (72%) and showed features of consolidations <lb/>(80%).

			<body>be an independent predictor of ICU-Int. A longer LOS was also independently associated with <lb/>ICU-Int (1.082 [1.026-1.142]). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Early prognostication of disease remains a prevailing challenge in the ongoing COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic, especially in developing countries where healthcare resources are limited. Previ-<lb/>ously published data from China and the developed world has highlighted the potential role of <lb/>imaging in the early identification and prognostication of COVID-19 [11, 13-15]. In this <lb/>study, we described the experience of CXR imaging in patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary <lb/>care hospital in Pakistan, and explored the association of a CXR-SS proposed by Wong et al. <lb/>[11] with clinical outcomes such as ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int) and mortality. <lb/>Though previous studies have assessed the value of various CXR scoring systems in the man-<lb/>agement of patients with COVID-19 [11, 13-15], to the best of our knowledge this is the first <lb/>study done using a CXR-SS adapted from the RALE score in prognostication of clinical out-<lb/>comes of COVID-19 patients. <lb/>The majority of patients in our study had bilateral, peripheral disease with predominantly <lb/>lower lobe distribution, with consolidation being the prominent feature, on initial CXR. This <lb/>pattern of findings has been demonstrated previously [6, 16]. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effu-<lb/>sion and pneumothorax were infrequent findings in our study. On initial CXR, the majority <lb/>(69.3%) of patients had a CXR-SS between 0-4. However, 52% of patients&apos; highest CXR-SS <lb/>ranged from 5-8. <lb/>On multivariable logistic regression, a positive initial CXR (CXR-SS &gt; 0) was associated <lb/>with greater age (OR: 1.060 [95% CI: 1.009-1.113]), while initial CXR-SS 5-8 was associated <lb/>with ICU-Int (2.532 [1.109-5.782]). Moreover, initial CXR-SS was also found to be an inde-<lb/>pendent predictor of both ICU-Int (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and mortality (1.278 [1.010-1.617]). <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>Patients&apos; highest CXR-SS was also identified as a predictor of ICU-Int (1.390 [1.143-1.690]), <lb/>with a highest CXR-SS 5-8 also being associated with the male gender (2.426 [1.027-5.731]). <lb/>Thus, the CXR-SS system used in our study appeared to show a strong relationship with clini-<lb/>cal outcomes, with greater CXR-SS being associated with ICU-Int (initial and highest CXR-SS) <lb/>and mortality (initial CXR-SS). Moreover, ICU-Int was independently associated with a longer <lb/>length of hospital stay (1.082 [1.026-1.142]). Other independent predictors of mortality <lb/>included patient age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]). A study by <lb/>Borghesi et al. similarly found that their self-designed CXR severity score (named the Brixia <lb/>score) was independently associated with mortality [13, 14]. Toussie et al. similarly reported <lb/>that their CXR severity score predicted hospital admission and intubation [15]. Additionally, <lb/>the independent association of CXR-SS 5-8 with male gender in our study is also in line with <lb/>observations whereby males are found to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 [17]. <lb/>The findings of our study, when taken in consideration collectively, hold particular relevance <lb/>for resource-constrained countries such as Pakistan, where a longer length of hospital stay <lb/>translates into additional expenses for the patient. The CXR-SS is useful as it is easily reproduc-<lb/>ible, and enables radiologists to provide treating physicians with understandable quantitative <lb/>information regarding the extent of pulmonary infection. However, further studies with larger <lb/>patient samples are required to validate the CXR-SS as a tool for prognostication in COVID-<lb/>19. <lb/>Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of its design, and the relatively <lb/>small sample size. However, observer bias was addressed by blinding the radiologists to the <lb/>diagnosis and clinical condition of the patient. Furthermore, findings on initial CXR were vari-<lb/>able due to a heterogeneity in duration of symptoms and infection upon presentation to the <lb/>hospital&apos;s emergency department. Moreover, as portable CXRs were used, positioning and <lb/>other exposure-related factors may confound CXR findings. Lastly, this study did not contain <lb/>a control group of patients (COVID-19 negative) to compare CXR findings and CXR-SS with. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The chest x-ray severity scoring (CXR-SS) system used in this study is a valuable method of <lb/>disease prognostication in COVID-19, as initial and highest subsequent CXR-SS show strong <lb/>association with ICU admission and mortality. The benefits of this CXR-SS lie in its reproduc-<lb/>ibility, ability to convey easily understandable objective information between radiologist and <lb/>treating physician, and feasibility in resource-constrained settings. While the results of our <lb/>study serve as an initial step towards the validation of the CXR-SS as a prognosticative tool, <lb/>further studies with larger samples are warranted in this regard. <lb/></body>
