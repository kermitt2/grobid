			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>The spin-dependent structure function of the proton, g <lb/>p <lb/>1 , has <lb/>been extensively studied in the last few decades. Precise mea-<lb/>surements of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 (x, Q 2 ) were realised in the deep inelastic regime <lb/>of charged lepton nucleon scattering at photon virtualities Q 2 &gt; <lb/>1 (GeV/c) 2 [1,2] over a wide range of the Bjorken scaling vari-<lb/>able x. On the contrary, the behaviour of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 at lower Q 2 is <lb/>largely unknown. For fixed-target experiments, the values of Q 2 <lb/>1 (GeV/c) 2 imply small values of x. This low-Q 2 region is governed <lb/>by &apos;soft&apos; processes and the transition to the region of higher Q 2 is <lb/>still not understood. <lb/>Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) allows for a description of <lb/>&apos;hard&apos; interactions using a perturbative expansion that is known <lb/>to be applicable for Q 2 values as low as about 1 (GeV/c) 2 . For <lb/>lower values of Q 2 , soft interactions become relevant and &apos;non-<lb/>perturbative&apos; mechanisms dominate the reaction dynamics. In or-<lb/>der to provide a suitable description of the non-perturbative re-<lb/>gion and also of the transition region between &apos;soft&apos; and &apos;hard&apos; <lb/>physics, it is tried in phenomenological calculations to extrapolate <lb/>ideas based on the parton model to the low-Q 2 region and add <lb/>mechanisms like (generalised) vector meson dominance, (G)VMD, <lb/>supplemented by the Regge model (see Refs. [3-6]). New and pre-<lb/>cise data on g <lb/>p <lb/>1 (x, Q 2 ) in the low-Q 2 region are hence essential to <lb/>improve and validate such calculations. <lb/>Measurements at low x and low Q 2 are scarce as they put <lb/>very high demands on event triggering and reconstruction. In spin-<lb/>dependent leptoproduction they were performed only by the Spin <lb/>Muon Collaboration (SMC) using proton and deuteron targets [7] <lb/>and by the COMPASS Collaboration using a deuteron target [8]. <lb/>The latter, very precise results do not reveal any spin effects in g d <lb/>1 <lb/>over the whole measured interval of x. In this Letter, we present <lb/>new results obtained on the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry <lb/>A <lb/>p <lb/>1 and the spin-dependent structure function g <lb/>p <lb/>1 for the proton, in <lb/>the kinematic region 0.0062 (GeV/c) 2 &lt; Q 2 &lt; 1 (GeV/c) 2 and 4 × <lb/>10 −5 &lt; x &lt; 4 × 10 −2 . The data are analysed in four 2-dimensional <lb/>grids of kinematic variables, i.e. (x, Q 2 ), (ν, Q 2 ), (x, ν) and (Q 2 , x), <lb/>where ν denotes the virtual-photon energy in the target rest <lb/>frame. Note that the last grid differs from the first one in the <lb/>number of bins chosen per variable. The lower limit in x coincides <lb/>with that used in the COMPASS low-Q 2 deuteron analysis [8]. The <lb/>low-Q 2 results presented in this Letter complement our published <lb/>proton measurements covering the high-Q 2 region [2,9]. <lb/>This Letter is organised as follows. We briefly describe the ex-<lb/>perimental set-up in Sec. 2, the event selection in Sec. 3 and the <lb/>method of asymmetry calculation in Sec. 4. The results are pre-<lb/>sented in Sec. 5 and the summary is given in Sec. 6. <lb/>2. Experimental set-up <lb/>The measurements were performed using the COMPASS fixed-<lb/>target set-up and positively charged muons provided by the M2 <lb/>beam line of the CERN SPS. In 2007, the beam had a momentum of <lb/>160 GeV/c with 5 × 10 7 μ + /s in 4.8 s long spills every 16.8 s and <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 1. 200 GeV data. Left: Distribution of the variable qθ for events with one (positively or negatively charged) additional track outgoing from the primary interaction vertex. <lb/>Events between vertical lines are removed from further analysis. Note the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis. Right: x distribution of accepted events without and with μe <lb/>event rejection. <lb/>in 2011 a momentum of 200 GeV/c with 10 7 μ + /s in 10 s long <lb/>spills every 40 s. The beam had a momentum spread of 5%. It was <lb/>naturally polarised with a polarisation P b of about −0.8, which is <lb/>known with a precision of 5%. Momentum and trajectory of each <lb/>incident muon were measured before the target by scintillator ho-<lb/>doscopes, scintillating fibre and silicon microstrip detectors. <lb/>A large solid-state target of ammonia (NH 3 ) inside a large-<lb/>aperture superconducting solenoid provided longitudinally po-<lb/>larised protons. The proton polarisation was achieved by dynamic <lb/>nuclear polarisation and reached an average value of |P t |≈0.85. <lb/>The dilution factor f , which accounts for the presence of unpolar-<lb/>isable material in the target, is about 0.16 for ammonia. The target <lb/>material was contained in three cylindrical cells of 4 cm diame-<lb/>ter with 30 cm, 60 cm and 30 cm length, which were separated by <lb/>5 cm gaps and located along the beam one after the other. Neigh-<lb/>bouring cells were polarised in opposite directions in order to use <lb/>both target polarisations simultaneously during data taking. The <lb/>polarisation directions were inverted on a regular basis by rotating <lb/>the direction of the target magnetic field, thus compensating for <lb/>acceptance differences between different cells and thereby min-<lb/>imising possible systematic effects. Once per year the direction of <lb/>the polarisation with respect to the solenoid field was reverted by <lb/>repolarisation in opposite direction keeping the solenoid field un-<lb/>changed. Ten NMR coils surrounding the target material allowed <lb/>for a measurement of P t with a precision of 2% in 2007 and 3.5% <lb/>in 2011. <lb/>Momentum and angle of scattered muons and other produced <lb/>particles were measured in a two-stage open forward spectrome-<lb/>ter with large angle and momentum acceptance using two dipole <lb/>magnets with tracking detectors upstream and downstream of <lb/>the magnets. Scintillating fibre and micropattern gaseous detectors <lb/>were employed in and close to the beam region, while multiwire <lb/>proportional chambers, drift chambers and straw tube detectors <lb/>covered the outer areas. <lb/>Scattered muons were identified by drift tube planes behind <lb/>iron and concrete absorbers in both first and second stage of the <lb/>spectrometer. Particle identification is not used in the current anal-<lb/>ysis. Two different types of triggers were employed. &quot;Inclusive&quot; <lb/>triggers were based on coincidences of hodoscope signals produced <lb/>by scattered muons. &quot;Semi-inclusive&quot; triggers required an energy <lb/>deposit in one of the hadron calorimeters with an optional coinci-<lb/>dence with an inclusive trigger. The reader is referred to Ref. [10] <lb/>for the detailed description of the muon beam, the three-cell po-<lb/>larised NH 3 target and the COMPASS spectrometer. <lb/>3. Event selection <lb/>Events selected for the analysis are required to have a recon-<lb/>structed incoming muon, a scattered muon and an interaction ver-<lb/>tex. As scattering angles in the laboratory frame are very small <lb/>for low-Q 2 events, at least one additional track attached to the <lb/>vertex is required to improve the vertex resolution in beam direc-<lb/>tion. For the 2007 data, incoming muon momenta are required to <lb/>range between 140 GeV/c and 180 GeV/c, and for the 2011 data <lb/>between 185 GeV/c and 215 GeV/c. In order to equalise the beam <lb/>flux through all target cells, the extrapolated track of the incom-<lb/>ing muon is required to pass through all target cells. Interactions <lb/>originating from the unpolarised material surrounding the target <lb/>are rejected by imposing appropriate constraints on the position of <lb/>the interaction vertex. The scattered muon is identified by requir-<lb/>ing that it has passed more than 15 radiation lengths of material <lb/>and it has to point back to the hodoscope that triggered the event. <lb/>Kinematic constraints are applied on the photon virtuality, Q 2 &lt; <lb/>1 (GeV/c) 2 , and on the Bjorken scaling variable, x &gt; 4 × 10 −5 , as <lb/>it was done in the analysis of the COMPASS deuteron data [8]. <lb/>The latter constraint is used to avoid the region where x cannot <lb/>be determined with sufficient accuracy. In addition, the fraction of <lb/>the energy lost by the incoming muon has to fulfil the condition <lb/>0.1 &lt; y &lt; 0.9, where the lower limit removes badly reconstructed <lb/>events and the upper limit removes events with large radiative <lb/>corrections as well as low-momentum muons resulting from pion <lb/>decay-in-flight. These kinematic constraints lead to a minimum <lb/>value of about 5 GeV/c 2 for W , where W is the invariant mass <lb/>of the γ * p system of virtual photon and proton. <lb/>For a given primary interaction vertex with incident and scat-<lb/>tered muon, we require at least one additional (hadron candidate) <lb/>track that has to carry a fraction z of the virtual photon en-<lb/>ergy with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1 and a momentum p &lt; 140 GeV/c (2007) <lb/>or p &lt; 180 GeV/c (2011). Here, the condition on z rejects poorly <lb/>reconstructed tracks and the condition on p removes beam halo <lb/>muons. This &quot;hadron method&quot; [11] does not only improve the res-<lb/>olution of the primary interaction vertex but also allows the re-<lb/>duction of radiative background. <lb/>At the very low values of x studied in this analysis, there exists <lb/>a contamination by events that originate from elastic scattering of <lb/>muons off atomic electrons of the target material. These events <lb/>show up in the x distribution as a prominent peak around the <lb/>value x μe = m electron /M = 5.45 × 10 −4 , where M is the proton <lb/>mass. We remove this contamination by imposing a constraint on <lb/>the product qθ , where q = +1 (−1) is used if a particle of positive <lb/>(negative) charge is associated to the track and θ is the angle be-<lb/>tween the hadron candidate track and the virtual-photon direction. <lb/>In the range −3.6 &lt; log 10 (x) &lt; −3.0, events with one hadron can-<lb/>didate are rejected if −0.005 rad &lt; qθ &lt; 0.002 rad and events with <lb/>two hadron candidates if −0.001 rad &lt; qθ &lt; 0 rad. For the former <lb/>case and either charge of the hadron candidate, the distribution of <lb/>the product qθ is presented in Fig. 1 (left). In Fig. 1 (right), the x <lb/></body>

Asymmetry extraction <lb/>The longitudinal double-spin lepton-proton cross-section asym-<lb/>metry is given by <lb/>A <lb/>p <lb/>LL = <lb/>σ <lb/>→ <lb/>⇐ − σ <lb/>→ <lb/>⇒ <lb/>σ <lb/>→ <lb/>⇐ + σ <lb/>→ <lb/>⇒ <lb/>= D( A <lb/>p <lb/>1 + η A p <lb/>2 ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where the arrows refer to the longitudinal spin orientations of <lb/>incoming muon (→) and target proton (⇒). It can be decom-<lb/>posed into a longitudinal photon-nucleon asymmetry A <lb/>p <lb/>1 and a <lb/>transverse photon-nucleon asymmetry A <lb/>p <lb/>2 , where the longitudinal <lb/>asymmetry is defined in terms of the γ * p cross sections as <lb/>A <lb/>p <lb/>1 = <lb/>σ 1/2 − σ 3/2 <lb/>σ 1/2 + σ 3/2 <lb/>. <lb/>(2) <lb/>Here, the subscript refers to the total angular momentum of the <lb/>γ * p system. The factor D in Eq. (1) is the so-called depolarisation <lb/>factor and η is a kinematic factor. Full expressions for D and η are <lb/>given in Ref. [8]; the behaviour of D in the kinematic region of this <lb/>analysis is shown in Fig. 2 (left). In the COMPASS kinematic range, <lb/>the factor η is negligible, hence the term containing the transverse <lb/>asymmetry A <lb/>p <lb/>2 is of negligible size and its possible contribution is <lb/>included in the systematic uncertainty of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 . <lb/>The number of events originating from a given target cell with <lb/>a given direction of the target polarisation can be expressed as <lb/>N i = a i φ i n i σ (1 + P b P t f D A <lb/>p <lb/>1 ), i = o1, c1, o2, c2. <lb/>(3) <lb/>Here, a i is the acceptance, φ i the beam flux, n i the number of <lb/>target nuclei, σ the spin-independent cross section and f the di-<lb/>lution factor. The four equations of Eq. (3) denoted by the subscript <lb/>i are giving the numbers of events that originate from either the <lb/>combined outer cells (o) or the central cell (c), each for the two <lb/>directions of the solenoid field (1 or 2). They are combined into <lb/>a second-order equation in A <lb/>p <lb/>1 for the ratio (N o1 N c2 )/(N o2 N c1 ), <lb/>where the product a i φ i n i σ cancels provided that the ratio of ac-<lb/>ceptances of the central cell c and the outer cells o is the same <lb/>before and after field reversal. In order to minimise the statisti-<lb/>cal uncertainty of the asymmetry, the factor w = P b f D is used as <lb/>time-independent event weight. The target polarisation P t is not <lb/>included, as its possible time dependence could induce false asym-<lb/>metries. <lb/>The dilution factor f includes a correction factor ρ = σ p <lb/>1γ /σ <lb/>p <lb/>tot <lb/>[12] that accounts for radiative events originating from unpolarised <lb/>target protons. This effective dilution factor depends only weakly <lb/>on the incident energy, decreases with x and reaches a value of <lb/>about 0.17 at x ∼ 10 −4 and about 0.15 at x ∼ 10 −2 . Its relative un-<lb/>certainty amounts to 5%. The x dependence of the average dilution <lb/>factor is shown in Fig. 2 (right). The beam polarisation is a func-<lb/>tion of the beam momentum and is taken from a parametrisation <lb/>based on a Monte Carlo simulation of the beam line, which was <lb/>validated by SMC [13]. <lb/>The final value of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 is obtained as the weighted average of <lb/>the values calculated for the two target-spin orientations. It is <lb/>corrected for spin-dependent radiative effects [14] and for the po-<lb/>larisation of the 14 N nuclei present in the target. It was verified <lb/>that the use of semi-inclusive triggers and the requirement of a <lb/>reconstructed hadron do not bias the determination of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 [11,15]. <lb/>More details on the analysis can be found in Ref. [16]. <lb/>The additive and multiplicative systematic uncertainties of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 <lb/>are shown in Table 1. The largest multiplicative contribution origi-<lb/>nates from the depolarisation factor D through its dependence on <lb/>the poorly known function R = σ L /σ T , which is the ratio of the ab-<lb/>sorption cross sections of longitudinally and transversely polarised <lb/>virtual photons. The parameterisation of the function R described <lb/>in detail in Ref. [8] takes into account all existing measurements <lb/>together with an extension to very low values of Q 2 . As system-<lb/>atic uncertainty of R a constant value of 0.2 is taken for Q 2 &lt; <lb/></body>

The largest additive contribution originates from pos-<lb/>sible false asymmetries, which are estimated from time-dependent <lb/>instabilities in the spectrometer as described in Ref. [16]. In certain <lb/>bins, it can be larger than the statistical uncertainty. <lb/>The spin-dependent structure function of the proton, g <lb/>p <lb/>1 , is de-<lb/>termined from the virtual-photon asymmetry A <lb/>p <lb/>1 neglecting A <lb/>p <lb/>2 : <lb/>g <lb/>p <lb/>1 = <lb/>F <lb/>p <lb/>2 <lb/>2x(1 + R) <lb/>A <lb/>p <lb/>1 . <lb/>(4) <lb/>Here, F <lb/>p <lb/>2 is the spin-independent structure function of the proton. <lb/>For F <lb/>p <lb/>2 we used the SMC parameterisation [11] within its validity <lb/>limits, i.e. x &gt; 0.0009 and Q 2 &gt; 0.2 (GeV/c) 2 .

			<body>Fig. 5. The spin-dependent structure function g <lb/>p <lb/>1 as a function of Q 2 in 15 bins of x, <lb/>shifted vertically for clarity. Open (closed) symbols correspond to 160 GeV (200 GeV) <lb/>data with error bars showing statistical uncertainties. <lb/>tainties of A LL and R were already discussed above. The system-<lb/>atic uncertainty of F <lb/>p <lb/>2 is estimated from difference between <lb/>the SMC parameterisation and the models of Refs. [17,19,20]. It is <lb/>taken as half of the maximum of the absolute differences between <lb/>the used parameterisation or model and the remaining models. <lb/>For Q 2 &gt; 0.2 (GeV/c) 2 , this is always the absolute value of the <lb/>difference between the SMC parameterisation and the model of <lb/>Refs. [17,19]. When calculating g <lb/>p <lb/>1 using Eq. (5) instead of Eq. (4), <lb/>we benefit from the fact that D and R are correlated (see also <lb/>Ref. [8]), which results in a reduced systematic uncertainty com-<lb/>pared to the one of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 . <lb/>5. Results <lb/>We present here the results for the spin asymmetry A <lb/>p <lb/>1 and <lb/>the spin structure function g <lb/>p <lb/>1 measured in the kinematic range <lb/>Q 2 &lt; 1 (GeV/c) 2 and 4 × 10 −5 &lt; x &lt; 4 × 10 −2 using the two beam <lb/>energies 160 GeV and 200 GeV. For each beam energy, the data <lb/>are analysed in four two-dimensional grids: (x, Q 2 ), (ν, Q 2 ), (x, ν) <lb/>and (Q 2 , x), where the latter has a smaller number of x bins. <lb/>The x dependence of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 at the measured values of Q 2 is shown <lb/>in Fig. 3 (left) for the two beam energies. A positive asymme-<lb/>try is observed, which slightly rises with x. It amounts to about <lb/>0.01 at x &lt; 10 −3 , indicating for the first time the existence of <lb/>spin effects at such small values of x. Note that the COMPASS <lb/>results for the deuteron [8] show an asymmetry A d <lb/>1 compatible <lb/>with zero. In Fig. 3 (left), also the results for A <lb/>p <lb/>1 from SMC [7, <lb/>11] and HERMES [21] are shown. Within the large statistical un-<lb/>certainties, their results are consistent with our present results, <lb/>but also with zero. Compared to the results from SMC, which is <lb/>the only other experiment that covers the low-x region, we im-<lb/>prove the statistics by a factor of about 150. In Fig. 3 (right), <lb/>the ν-dependence of A p <lb/>1 is shown. A rather flat distribution is <lb/>measured, apart from a slight enhancement for ν &lt; 50 GeV that <lb/>corresponds to higher values of Q 2 . In Fig. 4, the results for A <lb/>p <lb/>1 <lb/>are shown versus Q 2 for the 15 bins in x. The results obtained at <lb/>Fig. 6. The spin-dependent structure function g <lb/>p <lb/>1 as a function of x in 5 bins of Q 2 . <lb/>Closed (open) symbols correspond to 160 GeV (200 GeV) data with error bars show-<lb/>ing statistical uncertainties. Bands indicate the size of the systematic uncertainties. <lb/>The data points of the first bin in Q 2 are slightly shifted to the left for better visi-<lb/>bility. <lb/>160 GeV and 200 GeV are consistent in the overlapping Q 2 region. <lb/>From the figure, no conclusion on a possible Q 2 dependence can <lb/>be drawn. <lb/>For the two beam energies, our results on g <lb/>p <lb/>1 are shown versus <lb/>Q 2 for the same 15 bins in x (Fig. 5) and versus x in 5 different <lb/>bins in Q 2 (Fig. 6). Down to the smallest value of x, i.e. 4 × 10 −5 , <lb/>g <lb/>p <lb/>1 is positive within experimental uncertainties and does not show <lb/>any trend to become negative or to grow with decreasing values <lb/>of x. <lb/>All numerical values are available on HepData [22]. The numer-<lb/>ical values for A <lb/>p <lb/>1 and g <lb/>p <lb/>1 versus x, averaged over Q 2 , are given <lb/>together with their statistical and systematic uncertainites in Ta-<lb/>ble A.1 of the appendix for the two energies separately. The data <lb/>for the two energies were combined and false asymmetries reeval-<lb/>uated for the merged data. The values for the combined results are <lb/>given in Table A.2. <lb/>In Fig. 7, the present results on g <lb/>p <lb/>1 are compared with the pre-<lb/>dictions of the phenomenological models of Refs. [5,6]. The first <lb/>model (BKZ) is based on GVMD ideas supplemented by the Regge <lb/>formalism. The contribution of heavy vector mesons to g <lb/>p <lb/>1 was <lb/>treated as an extrapolation of the QCD improved parton model to <lb/>arbitrarily low values of Q 2 . The magnitude of the light vector me-<lb/>son contribution was fixed in the photoproduction limit by relating <lb/>the first moment of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 to the static properties of the proton via the <lb/>Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule [23], using the measurements <lb/>in the region of baryonic resonances [24]. For more details, see <lb/>Ref. [5] and references therein. In these models, both perturbative <lb/>and non-perturbative contributions to g <lb/>p <lb/>1 are found to be present <lb/>at all values of Q 2 . Reasonable agreement is observed between <lb/>the BKZ model and our measurements in all four two-dimensional <lb/>grids of kinematic variables. Fig. 7 (left) shows a comparison of the <lb/>x dependence of the BKZ model prediction with the results for g <lb/>p <lb/>1 <lb/>obtained combining the 160 GeV and 200 GeV results. <lb/>In the model of Ref. [6] (ZR), the nonperturbative part of g 1 is <lb/>also parameterised using the vector meson dominance mechanism <lb/>together with Regge predictions (albeit done differently than in <lb/>Ref. [5]), while in the perturbative part QCD evolution is employed <lb/>together with parton recombination corrections. The g <lb/>p <lb/>1 calcula-<lb/>tions of Ref. [6] are presented in Fig. 7 (right), where the broad <lb/>bump at lowest values of x is almost entirely due to the VMD con-<lb/>tribution. <lb/>6.

			<body>Fig. 7. Left: x dependence of combined g <lb/>p <lb/>1 data. The curve shows results of the g <lb/>p <lb/>1 calculations of BKZ [5], where for the parameterisation of the perturbative part of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 the <lb/>DSSV [25] parton distributions at NLO accuracy are used. Right: Comparison of the x dependence of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 at 160 GeV (open symbols) and 200 GeV (closed symbols) with the <lb/>results of the calculations of ZR [6] at 160 and 200 GeV incident energy (solid and dotted lines). Error bars represent statistical and bands systematic uncertainties. <lb/>0.006 (GeV/c) 2 &lt; Q 2 &lt; 1 (GeV/c) 2 and 4 × 10 −5 &lt; x &lt; 4 × 10 −2 , <lb/>these results improve the statistical precision by a factor of more <lb/>than 10 compared to existing measurements. <lb/>The values of A <lb/>p <lb/>1 (x) and g <lb/>p <lb/>1 (x) are found to be positive over the <lb/>whole measured range of x, with a value of about 0.01 for the spin <lb/>asymmetry for x &lt; 10 −3 . While the earlier results obtained using a <lb/>deuteron target were found to be consistent with zero, the present <lb/>measurement shows for the first time non-zero spin effects at such <lb/>small values of x. The data are compared to two phenomenologi-<lb/>cal models of g <lb/>p <lb/>1 valid in the region of low x and low Q 2 [5,6], <lb/>for which vector meson dominance and ideas based on the par-<lb/>ton model are used to extrapolate the structure function g <lb/>p <lb/>1 to low <lb/>values of Q 2 . These models describe the general trend in the data <lb/>over the whole Q 2 range of the data. <lb/></body>
