Here, we present a phenotypic AMR analysis and molecular character <lb/>ization of Escherichia coli isolate found in municipal drinking water after an accident <lb/>in the water supply system of a residential building in Armenia in 2021. CrieF1144 E. <lb/>coli isolate was resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, <lb/>levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, colistin, and tigecycline, whereas whole <lb/>genome sequencing (WGS) revealed blaTEM-1B, tet(A), and a combination of dfrA14 with <lb/>sul1 resistance determinants, which corresponds well with phenotypic resistance above. <lb/>Moreover, the multidrug-resistant isolate studied harbored mcr-1.1 gene on a conjuga <lb/>tive 251 Kb IncHI2 plasmid, whose structure was determined using hybrid short-and <lb/>long-reads assembly. CrieF1141_p1 plasmid carried all antimicrobial resistance genes <lb/>revealed in the isolate and did not harbor any virulence determinants, so it could <lb/>contribute to the spread of AMR genes in the bacterial population. Two copies of ISApl1 <lb/>transposase-encoding element, which is likely to mediate mcr-1.1 gene mobilization, <lb/>were revealed surrounding this gene in a plasmid. <lb/>IMPORTANCE Evolutionary patterns of Escherichia coli show that they usually develop <lb/>into highly pathogenic forms by acquiring fitness advantages such as antimicro <lb/>bial resistance (AMR) and various virulence factors through horizontal gene transfer <lb/>mediated by mobile elements. This has led to high prevalence of multidrug-resistant <lb/>(MDR) strains, which highlights the relevancy of enhanced surveillance to monitor <lb/>and prevent transmission of the MDR bacteria to human and animal populations. <lb/>However, the limited number of reports regarding the whole genome sequencing (WGS) <lb/>investigation of MDR E. coli strains isolated from drinking water and harboring mcr <lb/>genes hampers the adoption of a comprehensive approach to address the relationship <lb/>between environmental E. coli populations and human and veterinary infections. Our <lb/>results highlight the relevance of analyzing the environment, especially water, as a part <lb/>of the surveillance programs to understand the origins and dissemination of antimicro <lb/>bial resistance within the One Health concept. <lb/>KEYWORDS Escherichia coli, colistin, One Health concept, WGS, multidrug resistance, <lb/>mcr-1.1, conjugative plasmid structure <lb/>October 2024 Volume 12 Issue 10 <lb/>10.1128/spectrum.00751-24 1 <lb/>Editor Felix Ngosa Toka, Ross University School of <lb/>Veterinary Medicine, Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis <lb/>Address correspondence to Anna Karpenko, <lb/>bioanna1995@gmail.com. <lb/>Anna Karpenko and Andrey Shelenkov contributed <lb/>equally to this article.

			<body>T he One Health approach highlights the importance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) <lb/>as a major issue in public health, livestock, and agriculture. The increasing rate <lb/>of AMR, especially in clinically significant bacterial species, has become a serious and <lb/>growing global public health problem in this century, leading to limiting possible <lb/>treatment options. Currently, a huge number of studies involving clinically relevant <lb/>pathogens are conducted. However, effective control of the emergence and spread of <lb/>AMR determinants requires a comprehensive analysis of human and animal health and <lb/>environmental conditions (1). In fact, there is growing evidence of the environment&apos;s <lb/>role in the dissemination of AMR genes and strains, especially in anthropogenically <lb/>impacted ecosystems. For example, human or animal waste can be discharged into <lb/>water, contaminating it (2). Thus, the environment, and the agroecosystem particularly, <lb/>represents an important source of AMR (3). In this sense, the aquatic environments can <lb/>contribute to the spread of AMR bacteria and promote the increasing risk of transfer <lb/>ring resistant bacteria, in particular, the representatives of Enterobacteriaceae family, to <lb/>humans and animals. <lb/>Enterobacteriaceae members include important ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterial <lb/>pathogens like Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and many others (4), whose ability <lb/>to acquire mobile genetic elements carrying AMR and virulence determinants through <lb/>horizontal transfer by plasmids has become a public healthcare problem worldwide. <lb/>In the recent years, a dramatic decrease in the rates of successful treatment of infec <lb/>tions associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria has occurred, <lb/>especially in the cases of β-lactams and carbapenems (3), which led to further limita <lb/>tion of treatment options for infections caused by these bacteria. The dissemination <lb/>of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated carbapenemases has <lb/>essentially left no drug to treat such infections, except for the older and less patient-safe <lb/>last-resort antibiotic like colistin (4, 5). <lb/>Colistin, also known as polymyxin E, was widely used in veterinary medicine <lb/>previously, which ultimately led to the emergence of colistin-resistant isolates. Colistin <lb/>resistance was earlier associated with point mutations in chromosomal genes, whereas in <lb/>2015, the first plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant gene mcr-1 encoding a phosphoetha <lb/>nolamine transferase was revealed (6). Since then, 10 different mcr gene variants have <lb/>been reported, with mcr-1 being globally spread (7, 8). In the recent years, there was a <lb/>significant number of reports regarding colistin-resistant E. coli strains harboring mcr-1 <lb/>gene, which were isolated from farm animals and poultry in Europe and Asia (9-12). <lb/>Moreover, the number of studies reporting environmental contamination by colistin and <lb/>colistin-resistant strains is growing very quickly (13, 14). <lb/>In particular, E. coli isolates carrying mcr gene variants were reported in many cases <lb/>from humans, animals, food, and the environment worldwide (5). The presence of mcr-1 <lb/>and mcr-3 genes in animals, agricultural soils, and irrigation water was revealed in Algeria <lb/>(3), whereas the study from Bangladesh reported widespread dissemination of colistin-<lb/>resistant E. coli strains carrying mcr-1 in food, hand rinse, and surface water (4). Other <lb/>reports concerning non-potable water contamination included the detection of mcr-3-<lb/>and mcr-5-carrying E. coli in three rivers of the Western Cape of South Africa (15), a <lb/>colistin-resistant mcr-1-harboring E. coli isolate from touristic coastal water in Brazil (16), <lb/>and a recent report regarding two isolates carrying mcr-1 and mcr-3 from different rivers <lb/>in Thailand (17). <lb/>In summary, colistin resistance has become an important epidemiological prob <lb/>lem worldwide. However, only a limited number of reports concerning mcr-harboring <lb/>Enterobacteriaceae in drinking water have been published. <lb/>Here, we supplement the existing data with a detailed genomic analysis of colistin-<lb/>resistant mcr-1.1-carrying E. coli isolate collected from drinking water, and provide insight <lb/>into resistance mechanisms and spreading pathways. We believe that our research will <lb/>contribute to better management of the risks associated with further contamination of <lb/>the environment by colistin-resistant bacteria. <lb/></body>

			<body>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Sample collection, susceptibility testing, and DNA isolation <lb/>One E. coli isolate named CrieF1144 was selected for this study from the set of 11 <lb/>samples collected by the Armenia Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology as a part of <lb/>regular food and water monitoring activities in 2021. CrieF1144 was isolated from <lb/>municipal water after an accident in the water supply system in a residential build <lb/>ing. Worth noting, this water is usually used as drinking fresh water in Armenia, as <lb/>it is supplied from glaciers and mountain rivers. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ion <lb/>ization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) with Microflex LT system and <lb/>the MALDI Biotyper Compass v.4.1.80 software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) were used <lb/>for species detection, and an antimicrobial susceptibility test for CrieF1144 E. coli <lb/>was performed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method with a <lb/>Sensititre Analyzer (TREK Diagnostics Systems, USA). The susceptibility/resistance was <lb/>checked for amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefurox <lb/>ime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, colistin, imipenem, and <lb/>tigecycline. Broth microdilution method was used for colistin resistance determination. <lb/>SWIN software was applied to interpret the results in accordance with EUCAST version <lb/>11.0 (http://www.eucast.org, accessed in 2021). E. сoli ATCC25922 and E. coli ATCC35218 <lb/>were used for routine internal quality control tests for MIC determination. <lb/>Real-time PCR assay for mcr-1 <lb/>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using the PCR-kit «AmpliS <lb/>ens MDR MCR-1-FL» (Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, Moscow, Russia). The <lb/>qPCR assay was performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia), <lb/>and the data were analyzed with the Rotor-Gene 6000 v1.8 software. <lb/>Whole-genome sequencing <lb/>Genomic DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, <lb/>Germany). Quantity was evaluated by fluorimetry with Qubit 4.0 (Thermo Fisher <lb/>Scientific, USA), then the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) <lb/>was used for paired-end library preparation and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the <lb/>isolate on Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). <lb/>Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing system (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, <lb/>Oxford, UK) with the Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit SQK-RBK004 (Oxford Nanopore <lb/>Technologies, Oxford, UK) was used for long-read WGS. The libraries were prepared <lb/>according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocols and were sequenced on FLO-MIN106 R9.4 <lb/>flow cell with a standard 72-h sequencing protocol using the MinKNOW software version <lb/>22.03 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). <lb/>Genome assembly, data processing, and annotation <lb/>Base calling of the raw MinION data was performed with Guppy Basecaller version 6.4.6 <lb/>(Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), whereas demultiplexing was performed <lb/>using Guppy barcoding software version 6.4.6 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, <lb/>UK). Hybrid short-and long-read assembly was generated using Unicycler version 0.5.0 <lb/>(bold mode, SPAdes version 3.15.4 for short reads) (18). The contigs with a length lower <lb/>than 1,000 bp were discarded. <lb/>The genome assembly was uploaded to NCBI Genbank under the project number <lb/>PRJNA1075679, with the genome accession number JBAGRT000000000. <lb/>Resfinder 4.3.0 software was used for antimicrobial gene detection (https:// <lb/>cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/, accessed on 20 January 2024, using default <lb/>parameters) and point mutation analysis. Virulence factors were searched in VFDB <lb/>(http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm, accessed on 20 January 2024, using default <lb/>parameters).

			<body>features were revealed using MOB-suite (19) with default parameters (mob_typer version <lb/>3.1.2). Plasmid visualization was created using BRIG (version 0.95, https://github.com/ <lb/>happykhan/BRIG, accessed on 20 February 2024). <lb/>Insertion sequences were searched in the ISfinder database (https://www-is.bio <lb/>toul.fr/index.php, accessed on 26 February 2024). <lb/>The cgMLST profile building and comparison with reference data, as well as <lb/>plasmid comparison, were performed using BacWGSTdb server (20) (http://bacdb.cn/ <lb/>BacWGSTdb/index.php, accessed on 22 January 2024). <lb/>Plasmid multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed using Plas <lb/>mid PubMLST sequence definitions (21) (https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_plas <lb/>mid_seqdef, accessed on 24 January 2024). <lb/>CRISPRCasFinder (22) was used to check for the presence of CRISPR/Cas systems <lb/>and spacers in the genome. Anti-CRISPR elements were searched in AcrBank (http:// <lb/>cefg.uestc.cn/anti-CRISPRdb, accessed on 20 January 2024). Additional data processing <lb/>and output formatting were performed using the computational pipeline we developed <lb/>earlier (23, 24). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Isolate typing and resistance profile <lb/>In silico MLST typing revealed that the CrieF1144 sample isolated from drinking water <lb/>in Armenia belonged to ST457. According to the antimicrobial susceptibility analy <lb/>sis, it was susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefepime and ceftazi <lb/>dime), aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin), and carbapenems (imipenem and <lb/>meropenem), and resistant to the other groups of antimicrobial compounds tested <lb/>(Fig. 1A). Moreover, the MIC for colistin was 4 µg/mL, which indicates strong resistance <lb/>properties for the isolate studied because it is two times higher than the reference value <lb/>provided by the EUCAST standard, version 11.0. <lb/>In silico search for antimicrobial resistance determinants provided the results that <lb/>corresponded well to the phenotypic profile (Fig. 1). For example, the presence of <lb/>blaTEM-1B gene corresponds to ampicillin resistance, tet(A) gene provides resistance <lb/>to the group of tetracyclines, and combination of dfrA14 with sul1 confers resistance to <lb/>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Moreover, phenotypic resistance to colistin determined <lb/>for the isolate studied was attributed to the mcr-1.1 gene revealed by WGS, the presence <lb/>of which was additionally confirmed by the specific qPCR. At the same time, no <lb/>mutations known to provide colistin resistance were revealed in the pmrB gene. Besides, <lb/>lnu(F) and mph(A) were additionally found, which could be responsible for lincosamide <lb/>and erythromycin resistance, respectively. <lb/>FIG 1 (A) Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance profile of MDR E. coli isolate from drinking water in Armenia. Red color indicates resistance; MIC, milligram per <lb/>liter meanings, corresponds to EUCAST v11 standards. (B) Genotypic antimicrobial resistance profile of the CrieF1144 isolate from drinking water. Colors indicate <lb/>different antibiotic groups: blue shows β-lactams, green is used for fluoroquinolones, yellow for polymyxins, pink for carbapenems, white for aminoglycosides, <lb/>purple for tetracyclines, and orange for sulfonamides. <lb/></body>

		<body>Acquired ciprofloxacin resistance genes were not revealed in CrieF1144, but the <lb/>mutations in the chromosomal genes gyrA (S83L, D87Y), parC (S80I), and parE (S458A) <lb/>shown to provide such a resistance (25) were found. <lb/>In order to obtain additional information regarding bacteria similarity, a search for <lb/>similar isolates in terms of complete genome sequences was conducted. The closest <lb/>isolate in terms of cgMLST profile (presented in Table S1 for CrieF1144) was UFZG01 <lb/>from the UK, uploaded to Genbank in 2018. CrieF1144 and UFZG01 had only four allele <lb/>mismatches and, thus, can be considered as belonging to one clone according to criteria <lb/>proposed by Schürch et al. (26). Unfortunately, no data were provided regarding the <lb/>source of isolation for this sample. Two other close isolates contained 37 (SWME01, <lb/>Thailand) and 40 (JAAJTG01, Lebanon) allelic mismatches, respectively. Both of them <lb/>were clinical samples. Other reference isolates from NCBI Genbank included more than <lb/>80 allelic mismatches and, thus, were not considered to be similar to our isolate. <lb/>Virulence profiling <lb/>Virulence genes can be located on the chromosome or plasmids and are involved in a <lb/>complex of bacteria-host interactions. The set of virulence determinants for the isolate <lb/>studied was quite extensive (97 genes) and is presented in Table S2; all of them were <lb/>located on the chromosome. The major virulence factors are given in Table 1. Operons <lb/>of adhesion, nutrition, invasion, and effector delivery system proteins were identified <lb/>among them. In addition, Type VI Secretion System (tss), responsible for inter-bacterial <lb/>communication and survival (27), and outer membrane porin ompA associated with ion <lb/>transport, conjugation, and host-pathogen interactions (28) were found. <lb/>Plasmid typing, classification, and annotation <lb/>Plasmids are important subunits in dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence <lb/>genes via horizontal gene transfer. We identified the plasmids from four incompatibility <lb/>groups in the CrieF1144, the characteristics of which are shown in Table 2. IncHI2 <lb/>megaplasmid had a length of about 251 Kb, whereas another plasmid, IncHI1B, had a <lb/>size of almost twice less. Additionally, IncI2 plasmid was identified, and Col(KPHS6) was <lb/>the smallest one. Only IncHI2 plasmid carried AMR genes, whereas no AMR or virulence <lb/>determinants were revealed in other plasmids. <lb/>The smallest plasmid&apos;s nearest neighbor was pJJ1886_1 from E. coli JJ1886 (Genbank <lb/>accession CP006785). According to the MOB-typer tool, Col(KPHS6) was predicted to <lb/>be non-mobilizable, as well as IncHI1B, which had a similarity with the p266917_2_02 <lb/>plasmid from E. coli (CP026725.1). Conjugative IncI2 was similar to a plasmid from <lb/>Shigella flexneri (CP034061.1). The most interesting megaplasmid (pCrieF1144_1) was <lb/>also conjugative, despite the significant size, and was aligned perfectly to E. coli <lb/>plasmid 2 from UFZG01 isolate. Other similar plasmids of comparable length included <lb/>pCFSAN061771_02 (CP042898.1) and p19M12 (KY689632.1), although they lacked some <lb/>resistance genes revealed in pCrieF1144_1. <lb/>TABLE 1 Virulence profile of colistin-resistant E. coli isolate CrieF1144 <lb/>Isolate <lb/>MLST Function <lb/>Localization <lb/>Virulence genes <lb/>CrieF1144 ST457 Nutrition/metabolic factors <lb/>Chromosome <lb/>chuASTUVWXY <lb/>entABCDEFS <lb/>fepABCDEG iucABCD <lb/>Bacterial communication and <lb/>survival <lb/>Chromosome <lb/>Type VI Secretion System <lb/>(tssAMLJ) <lb/>Effector delivery system <lb/>Chromosome <lb/>espL1R1 × 4Y2Y4 <lb/>Adherence <lb/>Chromosome <lb/>fdeC <lb/>fimABCDEFGHI <lb/>yagVWXYZ/ecpEDCBA <lb/>ykgK/ecpR <lb/>Invasion <lb/>Chromosome <lb/>ibeBC kpsCDEFMSU <lb/></body>

		<body>Hybrid assembly allowed us to determine the refined plasmid structure and obtain <lb/>the data regarding AMR and virulence gene location, which represents an important step <lb/>in revealing the possible mechanisms of their transfer. <lb/>Below, we will focus on the IncHI2 megaplasmid carrying AMR genes. <lb/>The geographic location for a large part of closely related plasmids was China (see <lb/>Fig. 2). The plasmids were possessed by E. coli and Salmonella enterica isolates of human, <lb/>animal, and food origin. In total, 66 plasmids carried the mcr-1.1 gene, and one of them <lb/>-mcr-3.2 gene (p131681 [MH114596.1]). All these plasmids were selected for further <lb/>comparison if they possessed the IncHI2 replicon type, and the complete list with typing <lb/>results can be found in Table S3. <lb/>The double-locus sequence typing (DLST) typing of IncHI2 revealed smr0018 = 2 and <lb/>smr0099 = 2 alleles for pCrieF1141_1 plasmid. It is interesting that the reference plasmids <lb/>possessing the same allele variants did not carry mcr genes, whereas the ones with <lb/>smr0018 = 3 or 4 usually carried mcr-1.1. <lb/>It is also interesting that IncHI2 plasmid carried an anti-CRIPR protein AcrIIA7 targeted <lb/>against II-A system. CrieF1144 did not possess CRISPR-Cas system, and, in general, E. <lb/>coli isolates possessed either I-E or I-F systems (29), whereas II-A is more common for <lb/>streptococcal species (30). The map from Figure 2 was generated by BacWGSTdb server <lb/>(http://bacdb.cn/BacWGSTdb/index.php, accessed on 22 January 2024). <lb/>The structures of pCrieF1141_1 and similar reference plasmids are given in Figure 3. <lb/>The plasmids pCrieF1144_1, UFZG01_contig2 (purple), p19M12 (green), and <lb/>pCFSAN061771_02 (yellow) are shown. AMR genes carried by pCrieF1144_1 are <lb/>indicated. UFZG01_contig2 carried exactly the same set of genes, whereas two other <lb/>plasmids missed some AMR determinants.

		<body>was flanked by two transposase-encoding insertion elements ISApl1 belonging to the <lb/>IS30 transposon family. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. In <lb/>particular, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to colistin in MDR Entero <lb/>bacteriaceae is dangerous due to decreased effectiveness of polymyxins representing <lb/>the last-resort drugs for the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant <lb/>Gram-negative bacteria. The plasmid-borne colistin resistance genes (mcr) represent a <lb/>serious threat due to possible dissemination between different bacterial species through <lb/>horizontal gene transfer. The widespread usage of colistin in livestock and the presence <lb/>of mcr-1-positive E. coli strains in the food chain are considered to be the main rea <lb/>sons for the emergence of mcr-1-carrying E. coli in clinical cases (31, 32).

			<body>environment acts as a connection medium between different environments, thus playing <lb/>a critical role in the dissemination of AMR in nature, humans, and other animals (33, 34). <lb/>On the one hand, water represents an important vehicle for the introduction and <lb/>spread of drug-resistant organisms in nature; on the other hand, it is an ideal environ <lb/>ment for the horizontal exchange of AMR genes (35, 36). Accordingly, several studies <lb/>have reported the detection of resistant bacteria in rivers (15, 17), lakes (37), and sea <lb/>water (16). In addition, direct transmission of clinically significant bacteria with high <lb/>levels of antibiotic resistance to humans through the river water has been reported <lb/>(38). Moreover, farm wastewater and damaged sewer pipes also represent possible ways <lb/>of transferring AMR bacteria to groundwaters (33). Poisoned surface and groundwater <lb/>can lead to contamination of purification filters and drinking water in general. Thus, <lb/>it is essential to detect such bacteria in drinking water representing an important <lb/>source of AMR transmission to humans (39). For a better understanding of the role of <lb/>such environments and dissemination routes of mcr genes, we performed detection <lb/>and characterization of the colistin-resistant E. coli isolate, named CrieF1144, carrying <lb/>plasmid-mediated mcr-1.1 gene revealed in drinking water collected in Armenia. <lb/>All virulence genes in the CrieF1144 isolate were located on the chromosome, which <lb/>agrees with other studies (40). The main functions of the 96 determinants found included <lb/>adherence, invasion, nutrition and metabolic factors, delivery systems, survival, and <lb/>bacterial and host-pathogen interactions. <lb/>CrieF1144 belonged to ST457, which represents a globally disseminated E. coli lineage <lb/>with a broad host range revealed in all continents (41). ST457 isolates obtained from <lb/>clinical patients (42, 43), wildlife, and poultry (44, 45) were also frequently reported to <lb/>carry plasmid mcr genes. <lb/>In silico analysis of AMR determinants in CrieF1144 revealed a combination of dfrA14 <lb/>with sul1, blaTEM-1B, and tet(A), besides mcr-1, which corresponds well with phenotypic <lb/>resistance revealed in susceptibility tests. Such isolates co-harboring multiple AMR genes <lb/>are of special concern because they may further limit treatment options for E. coli <lb/>infections (46). Results similar to our findings were obtained in Japan (47), in which the <lb/>mcr-1 carried by E. coli isolates from wastewater treatment plants was revealed. At the <lb/>same time, numerous studies reported a dissemination of mcr-1 gene by E. coli among <lb/>humans, animals, and food products. For instance, a PCR analysis revealed mcr-1 in 62.5% <lb/>of samples isolated from production animals in Poland, particularly, from turkeys (48). <lb/>Moreover, a dual mechanism of colistin resistance, namely production of mcr-1 and <lb/>amino acid substitution in PmrA/PmrB, was detected in clinical isolates from Egypt (49). <lb/>Several mcr-positive E. coli isolates were obtained from rivers in Thailand (17) and <lb/>Africa (15), surface water in Bangladesh (4), and irrigation water in Algeria (3). However, <lb/>these reports did not include the plasmid data. Currently, the plasmids are considered as <lb/>the major vehicles for horizontal gene transfer of the mcr-1 variants (50). <lb/>IncHI2 is a common type of large mcr-1-carrying plasmids found worldwide (51), and <lb/>such plasmids play an important role in the mcr-1 transmission (52). To the best of our <lb/>knowledge, this is the first report of an IncHI2 carrying the mcr-1 gene revealed in E. coli <lb/>from drinking water in Armenia. Previously, mcr-1-positive IncHI2 plasmid-harboring E. <lb/>coli strains were revealed in clinical samples from Egypt (49), Vietnam (53), and China <lb/>(54), and in food-producing animals from China (55), Poland (48), and other European <lb/>countries (56). <lb/>We suppose that the mcr-1.1 gene carried by IncHI2 plasmid in CrieF1144 plays a <lb/>major role in colistin resistance of this isolate for two reasons. First, no known mutations <lb/>providing such a resistance were revealed in pmrA/pmrB, phoP/phoQ, and mgrB genes. <lb/>Second, we revealed two transposase-encoding IsApl1 elements flanking mcr-1.1 in <lb/>the plasmid sequence, which were shown to mediate the mobilization of this gene <lb/>leading to resistance acquisition (57). The presence of such plasmid-encoded transpos <lb/>able elements raises concerns of fast resistance spreading within the environmental <lb/>bacterial population. <lb/></body>

			<body>Thus, the hybrid assembly of the genome studied allowed us not only to reveal <lb/>the accurate structure of the chromosome and plasmids, but also to gain insights into <lb/>possible colistin resistance mechanisms for the CrieF1144 isolate. <lb/>In summary, this study focuses on high-resolution genomic analysis of the E. coli <lb/>isolate from drinking water, aiming to understand the genetic structure and pathogene <lb/>sis of this environmental strain. As the prevalence and dissemination of MDR E. coli is <lb/>a significant concern in the context of both human and animal populations, a compre <lb/>hensive One Health-based approach is necessary to study this important pathogen. <lb/>This approach involves the interconnections between human, animal, and environmen <lb/>tal health, and establishes the collaboration between various scientific and medical <lb/>fields to mitigate the growing threat of AMR spread and associated risks in urban <lb/>environments (37). In the current study, we performed WGS-based characterization <lb/>and phenotypic AMR analysis of the E. coli isolate obtained from drinking water, and <lb/>revealed the possible mechanism of colistin resistance transfer. The results emphasize <lb/>the importance of WGS-based monitoring of mcr-harboring Enterobacteriaceae in both <lb/>clinical and environmental settings in agreement with the One Health concept. <lb/></body>
