			<front>The role of TORC1 in muscle <lb/>development in Drosophila. <lb/>Isabelle Hatfield 1 , Innocence Harvey 1 , Lawrence T. Reiter 2,3 and Dave Bridges 1,2,* <lb/>1 Department of Physiology; 2 Department of Pediatrics; 3 Department of Neurology, <lb/>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163 <lb/>*Corresponding Author: <lb/>Address: Department of Physiology, 894 Union Ave, Memphis, Tennessee, 38163 <lb/>Email: dbridge9@uthsc.edu <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Myogenesis is an important process <lb/>during both development and muscle <lb/>repair. Previous studies suggest that <lb/>mTORC1 plays a role in the formation of <lb/> mature muscle from immature muscle <lb/>precursor cells. Here we show that gene <lb/>expression <lb/>for <lb/>several <lb/>myogenic <lb/>transcription factors including Myf5, Myog <lb/>and Mef2c but not MyoD decreases when <lb/>C2C12 cells are treated with rapamycin, <lb/>implying a role for mTORC1 pathway <lb/>during muscle development. <lb/>To <lb/>investigate the possibility that mTORC1 <lb/>can regulate muscle in vivo we ablated the <lb/>essential mTORC1 subunit Raptor in <lb/>Drosophila melanogaster and found that <lb/>muscle-specific ablation of Raptor causes <lb/>flies to be too weak to emerge from their <lb/>pupal cases during eclosion. Furthermore, <lb/>we found that there is a critical period <lb/>post-eclosure when Raptor ablation causes <lb/>lethality in flies. Together these results <lb/>highlight an important new role for <lb/>mTORC1 in late muscle development, <lb/>integrity or function. <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>The mTOR signaling pathway plays <lb/>important roles during development in all <lb/>eukaryotes and mTORC1 is a critical <lb/>nutrient sensing protein kinase conserved <lb/>in all eukaryotic organisms 1,2 . This kinase <lb/>responds to nutrient and growth hormone <lb/>signals in the environment and <lb/>subsequently <lb/>phosphorylates <lb/>targets <lb/>involved in aging, growth, protein lipid <lb/>and glycogen metabolism 3-5 . In addition <lb/>to these effects on differentiated cells, <lb/>there is an emerging role for mTORC1 in <lb/>the regulation of cellular differentiation <lb/>during <lb/>development <lb/>including <lb/>neurogenesis 6,7 , <lb/>adipogenesis 8 <lb/>and <lb/>myogenesis 9-11 . Consistent with these <lb/>findings, either loss of the obligate <lb/>mTORC1 complex members mTOR and <lb/>Raptor, or treatment with rapamycin <lb/>induces developmental arrest in mice 12-14 , <lb/>worms 15 and fruit flies 16 . <lb/>Myogenesis <lb/>occurs <lb/>both <lb/>during <lb/>development and throughout life via the <lb/>differentiation of muscle precursor cells <lb/>called satellite cells 17-19 . This process <lb/>involves a cascade of transcription factors <lb/>including several basic helix-loop-helix <lb/>transcription factors such as Myf5, Myog, <lb/>Myod and Mef2c (reviewed in 20,21 ). The <lb/>direct target of mTORC1 on myogenesis <lb/>has not been clearly established, but <lb/>recent work has implicated mTORC1 in <lb/>the regulation of MyoD protein stability, <lb/>leading to a miR-1 dependent effect on <lb/>myotube fusion 22 . <lb/></body>

			<body>To determine the relevance of mTORC1 <lb/>on muscle differentiation in vivo we have <lb/>examined the effects of loss of TORC1 by <lb/>both genetic and pharmacological <lb/>approaches in the fruit fly, Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster. In this study we present data <lb/>supporting an essential developmental <lb/>role of TORC1 in late muscle <lb/>development and/or stability. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Tissue Culture and Myotube <lb/>Formation <lb/>C2C12 cells were grown in High Glucose <lb/>Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s Medium <lb/>(DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented <lb/>with <lb/>penicillin, <lb/>streptomycin <lb/>and <lb/>glutamine (PSG; Life Technologies) and <lb/>10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma-Aldrich). <lb/>Once cells reached &gt;90% confluence, <lb/>differentiation media (2% Horse Serum <lb/>from Sigma-Aldrich in DMEM with PSG) <lb/>was added as previously described 23 To <lb/>determine when specific markers for <lb/>differentiation were being expressed, cell <lb/>lysates were prepared at time points <lb/>between 0 and 15 days of differentiation. <lb/>To determine the effects of rapamycin on <lb/>differentiation, cells were treated every <lb/>other day for 9 days with either vehicle <lb/>alone (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich), or 500nM <lb/>rapamycin (Cayman chemicals) dissolved <lb/>in DMSO. Cell lysates were prepared on <lb/>day 9 of treatment. Cell lysates were <lb/>generated by washing once with ice-cold <lb/>PBS followed by the addition of 1 ml of <lb/>QIAzol (Qiagen) and scraping into a <lb/>1.5ml microfuge tube. Lysates were stored <lb/>at -80°C until RNA was purified. <lb/>Quantitative Real Time PCR <lb/>RNA was extracted with the PureLink <lb/>RNA mini kit (Life Technologies). 1 µg of <lb/>total RNA was used as a template to <lb/>synthesize cDNA using the High Capacity <lb/>Reverse <lb/>Transcription <lb/>Kit <lb/>(Life <lb/>Technologies). cDNA was added to Power <lb/>SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in <lb/>accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>guidelines (Life Technologies) and qRT-<lb/>PCR performed on a Roche Lightcycler. <lb/>A series of control genes including Gapdh, <lb/>Rplp0, Actb and Rplp13a were examined, <lb/>and Gapdh was chosen as a control as it <lb/>did not change across rapamycin <lb/>concentrations <lb/>or <lb/>differentiation <lb/>conditions. <lb/>For a complete list of <lb/>primers and probes used, refer to Table 1. <lb/>Relative expression was determined via <lb/>the ΔΔCt method as previously <lb/>described 24 . <lb/>Drosophila Stocks and Crosses <lb/>The stocks w 1118 , the three muscle GAL4 <lb/>drivers (24B-GAL4, c179-GAL4 and mef2-<lb/>GAL4), as well as both the Raptor and Tsc1 <lb/>UAS-shRNA TRiP lines used (See Table <lb/>2) were obtained from the Bloomington <lb/>Stocks Center (Bloomington, IN). All <lb/>flies were raised at 25°C on standard corn <lb/>meal food with the exception of the 18°C <lb/>crosses for 24B-GAL4. Rapamycin was <lb/>added where indicated after fly food was <lb/>cooled to below ~50° C. To prepare the <lb/>crosses, virgin females were collected <lb/>Table 1: Forward and reverse primers used in qPCR experiments.

			<body>from each of the GAL4 driver strains. <lb/>Ten virgin females were used per cross. <lb/>Males with the appropriate genotype were <lb/>chosen from each of the lines and crossed <lb/>to male UAS-TRiP-shRNA lines for <lb/>Raptor (3) or Tsc1 (3) as well as a UAS-<lb/>TRiP control which contains the genomic <lb/>insertion site but no shRNA 25 . Flies were <lb/>maintained in a humidified (50-60%) <lb/>incubator at 25°C. A subset of <lb/>experiments were also performed at 18°C. <lb/>Ten days after each cross the F1 progeny <lb/>began to eclose and adults were sorted <lb/>according to phenotype and gender. <lb/>During each sorting, the number of flies <lb/>of each phenotype was recorded. The <lb/>sorted flies were put into new vials, with <lb/>males and females separated and with 5-<lb/>10 flies in each vial. Progeny were stored <lb/>at 25°C until at least 100 flies of each <lb/>genotype had been collected. At least <lb/>three independent replicates of each cross <lb/>were performed. <lb/>Quantification of Dead Pupae <lb/>Twenty days after the c179-GAL4&gt;UAS-<lb/>shRNA-Raptor and Mef2-GAL4&gt;UAS-<lb/>shRNA-Raptor crosses were made any <lb/>remaining adult or F1 progeny flies were <lb/>emptied from the vials. The empty pupal <lb/>cases were counted and the cases <lb/>containing dead flies were counted. Pupal <lb/>cases containing a dead fly were markedly <lb/>darker in color than the empty cases and <lb/>contained a visibly formed black, <lb/>shrunken fly. <lb/>Manual Assistance of Eclosure <lb/>In order to determine if flies were dying <lb/>because they were too weak to eclose <lb/>from their pupal cases or dead in their <lb/>pupal cases for other reasons we manually <lb/>removed the anterior puparial operculum <lb/>under a dissecting microscope using fine <lb/>forceps from stage ~12-13 pupae that <lb/>were fully formed, but had not yet <lb/>eclosed. This was accomplished by using a <lb/>thin sheet of plastic on the inside of the <lb/>vial on which the 3 rd instar larvae could <lb/>form pupae. The sheet was then removed <lb/>for imaging at various time points and to <lb/>manually open the pupal cases then placed <lb/>back into a fresh vial for incubation at 25 <lb/>°C. Using this method allowed for the <lb/>rescue of 3 mef2-GAL4&gt;UAS-Raptor-<lb/>shRNA adults that were too weak to begin <lb/>to eclose, but with assistance of the <lb/>removal of the operculum could get out <lb/>of the case, inflate their wings and <lb/>appeared morphologically normal. <lb/>Climbing Assay <lb/>To perform the climbing assay flies were <lb/>tapped to the bottom of a vial and a <lb/>stopwatch was started simultaneously. The <lb/>stopwatch was stopped each time a single <lb/>fly from the group in the vial climbed to a <lb/>mark at 4cm on the side of the vial. A <lb/>separate time was recorded for each fly in <lb/>the vial. This assay was performed within <lb/>3 days post eclosure and repeated every <lb/>~30 days for a total of 3 trials. <lb/>Statistics <lb/>Statistical analyses were performed using <lb/>the R statistical package (version 3.1.0) 26 . <lb/>Table 2: Fly stocks from Bloomington Stock Center <lb/>used in this study. <lb/>Name <lb/>Bloomington Stock # <lb/>Raptor shRNA #1 31528 <lb/>Raptor shRNA #2 31529 <lb/>Raptor shRNA #3 34814 <lb/>Raptor shRNA #4 41912 <lb/>Tsc1 shRNA #1 <lb/>31039 <lb/>Tsc1 shRNA #2 <lb/>31314 <lb/>Tsc1 shRNA #3 <lb/>35144 <lb/>Control shRNA <lb/>Line <lb/>36304 <lb/>Hand-GAL4 <lb/>48396 <lb/>24B-GAL4 <lb/>1767 <lb/>C179-GAL4 <lb/>6450 <lb/>Mef2-GAL4 <lb/>27390 <lb/></body>

			<body>Prior to performing ANOVA analyses, <lb/>normality was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk <lb/>tests and equal variance was tested using <lb/>Levene&apos;s tests (from the car package <lb/>(version 2.0-20) 27 ). <lb/>If both these <lb/>assumptions were met (p&gt;0.05) an <lb/>ANOVA was performed. If either of <lb/>these assumptions were not met, a <lb/>Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. If <lb/>either of those omnibus tests reached <lb/>significance, then Student&apos;s t-tests or <lb/>Wicoxon Rank Sum Tests were <lb/>performed as indicated, followed by an <lb/>adjustment for multiple comparisons <lb/>using the method of Benjamini and <lb/>Hochberg 28 . Statistical significance for the <lb/>manuscript was set at a p or q-value of &lt; <lb/>0.05. The investigators were blinded to <lb/>the genotype of the crosses until analysis. <lb/>All raw data, analyzed data and code used <lb/>to analyze the data and generate figures is <lb/>available <lb/>at <lb/>http://bridgeslab.github.io/DrosophilaM <lb/>uscleFunction/ 29 <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Rapamycin Inhibits Differentiation <lb/>of Muscle Cells in Culture <lb/>To determine the order in which <lb/>myogenic markers are induced during <lb/>myogenesis, we performed a time course <lb/>experiment in C2C12 cells. We generated <lb/>cell lysates at various time points between <lb/>0 and 15 days of the differentiation <lb/>process and performed qRT-PCR to <lb/>measure <lb/>transcripts <lb/>of <lb/>known <lb/>differentiation markers including Myf5, <lb/>Myog, Mef2c, Cdkn1a, and Myod1. We <lb/>observed that transcripts for Myf5, Myog, <lb/>Cdkn1a, and Myod1 are increased early in <lb/>the process (~ day 2) and continue to <lb/>increase throughout development with <lb/>large increases in Mef2c not occurring until <lb/>approximately day 5 or 6 (Figure 1A). This <lb/>is consistent with previous observations <lb/>of the transcriptional changes associated <lb/>with muscle differentiation of cells in <lb/>culture 30 . <lb/>Next we wanted to determine if <lb/>rapamycin, a drug known to inhibit <lb/>TORC1 signaling, had any effects on gene <lb/>expression during differentiation (Figure <lb/>Figure <lb/>1. <lb/>Rapamycin <lb/>blocks <lb/>C2C12 <lb/>differentiation.

			<body>1B and C). Treatment with rapamycin <lb/>caused significant reductions in mRNA <lb/>transcript levels detected for all <lb/>differentiation <lb/>markers <lb/>measured <lb/>(p&lt;0.05), with the exception of Myod1 <lb/>(Figure 1B) and prevented the formation <lb/>of myotubes (Figure 1C). <lb/>Since rapamycin does not reduce the <lb/>differentiation-associated elevation of <lb/>Myod1 transcript levels, consistent with <lb/>previous findings 22 , it is unlikely that the <lb/>mTORC1 target is upstream of Myod1 <lb/>transcription. <lb/>Furthermore, since the <lb/>elevation of several early differentiation <lb/>targets, including Myog, Myf5, and Cdkn1a <lb/>are all blocked by rapamycin our data <lb/>supports the hypothesis that mTORC1 is <lb/>required <lb/>downstream <lb/>of <lb/>Myod1 <lb/>transcription but still quite early in the <lb/>differentiation process. Since Mef2c does <lb/>not increase until late in the differentiation <lb/>process, and is downstream of Myog, <lb/>reductions in Mef2c levels are likely due to <lb/>defects upstream of Myog 31 . We therefore <lb/>predicted that mTORC1, required for <lb/>MyoD stabilization, may play a critical role <lb/>in muscle development and should be <lb/>tested in a live organism undergoing <lb/>myogenesis. <lb/>These data show that the mTORC1 <lb/>pathway is required to be active at a very <lb/>early time point during the differentiation <lb/>in C2C12 cells into myotubes. <lb/>Additionally, these data indicate that Myog, <lb/>Myf5, Cdkn1a and Mef2c all require <lb/>mTORC1 <lb/>function <lb/>for <lb/>their <lb/>transcriptional <lb/>activation <lb/>during <lb/>myogenesis. These data are consistent <lb/>with the hypothesis that one role of <lb/>mTORC1 in differentiation is through the <lb/>stabilization of MyoD as previously <lb/>suggested 22 , though whether there are <lb/>other mTORC1 targets in early <lb/>differentiation is not clear. Since the <lb/>primary effect of miRNA-1 is on myotube <lb/>fusion, it is likely that there are other <lb/>Figure 2. Skeletal muscle specific Raptor <lb/>knockdown causes lethality.

			<body>mTORC1 dependent effects, as the <lb/>morphological changes prior to myotube <lb/>fusion are also disrupted by rapamycin 11 . <lb/>Muscle Specific Knockdown of <lb/>Raptor Leads to Late Pupal <lb/>Lethality in Drosophila <lb/>In order to study the role of TORC1 <lb/>signaling on muscle development in vivo, <lb/>we manipulated dTORC1 function in the <lb/>model organism Drosophila melanogaster <lb/>(fruit flies). First, we tested whether <lb/>inhibition of the dTORC1 pathway <lb/>affected the development of these flies. <lb/>As previously reported, high doses of <lb/>rapamycin prevents egg laying in <lb/>females 16 . We performed dose curves and <lb/>found that at much lower doses (EC50 of <lb/>~860 nM), although eggs could be seen in <lb/>the vials, there was a complete absence of <lb/>pupae and adult flies (Supplementary <lb/>Figure 1). At these lower doses, there was <lb/>no obvious distinction between inhibition <lb/>of pupal lethality and prevention of fly <lb/>eclosure, ie there was no observable dose <lb/>in which pupae survived but flies were <lb/>unable eclose. These data suggest that <lb/>rapamycin <lb/>inhibits <lb/>fly <lb/>muscle <lb/>development, similar to what has been <lb/>observed in mice 12 . It also supports <lb/>studies showing that whole animal <lb/>knockout of Raptor leads to developmental <lb/>lethality in several model organisms 13-15,32 . <lb/>To look specifically at the role of <lb/>dTORC1 in muscle, we knocked down <lb/>either Tsc1 or Raptor to generate <lb/>constitutive gain and loss of function of <lb/>mTORC1 activity in fly muscles using the <lb/>GAL4-UAS system 33 . We used several <lb/>GAL4 drivers that drove expression of <lb/>the UAS shRNA cassettes in both skeletal <lb/>muscle and cardiac muscle. We targeted <lb/>skeletal muscle using 24B-GAL4, C179-<lb/>GAL4, and Mef2-GAL4 drivers, while <lb/>cardiac muscle was targeted using the <lb/>heart specific Hand-GAL4 driver. <lb/>To <lb/>minimize potential off target effects, three <lb/>different shRNAs were used from the <lb/>Harvard shRNA TRiP collection for each <lb/>of the two genes (Raptor and Tsc1). <lb/>First, we crossed heterozygous, balanced <lb/>24B-GAL4/TM3, <lb/>Sb <lb/>flies <lb/>with <lb/>heterozygous, <lb/>balanced <lb/>UAS-<lb/>shRNA/TM6B transgenic flies. The flies <lb/>inheriting both balancer chromosomes <lb/>had decreased viability and were excluded <lb/>from the analysis. Progeny from crosses <lb/>using the Hand-GAL4 driver appeared in <lb/>roughly equal ratios (Figure 2A), <lb/>indicating there is no obvious effect of <lb/>manipulating dTORC1 in cardiac cells. <lb/>Similarly, 24B-GAL4 driven expression of <lb/>Tsc1 shRNA had no significant effect on <lb/>viability. However, when the 24B-GAL4 <lb/>driver was used to express Raptor shRNA, <lb/>there was a dramatic decrease in the <lb/>number of eclosed flies (Figure 2B). This <lb/>indicates <lb/>that <lb/>24B-GAL4 <lb/>driven <lb/>expression of Raptor shRNA is lethal at <lb/>some point prior to eclosure. Similarly, <lb/>another muscle specific driver, c179-GAL4 <lb/>crossed to heterozygous UAS-Raptor-<lb/>shRNA/TM6B resulted in a reduced <lb/>number <lb/>muscle-specific <lb/>Raptor <lb/>knockdown flies (i.e. c179-GAL4&gt;UAS-<lb/>Raptor-shRNA), although in this case <lb/>some flies expressing UAS-Raptor-shRNA <lb/>were able to eclose (Figure 2C). <lb/>We next attempted to rescue the lethality <lb/>in 24B-GAL4&gt;UAS-Raptor-shRNA flies <lb/>by lowering the temperature of the cross <lb/>to 18 °C. Colder temperatures decrease <lb/>GAL4 expression in driver lines 33 . <lb/>Decreasing the temperature to 18 °C did <lb/>not rescue the lethality of the 24B-<lb/>GAL4/UAS-Raptor-shRNA flies, and the <lb/>birth rates of the two control genotypes <lb/>were congruent with birth rates at 25° C <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 2). <lb/>To test for the stage under which these <lb/>flies fail to eclose, we next used c179-<lb/></body>

			<body>GAL4 and Mef2-GAL4, which drives <lb/>expression late in muscle development 34 , <lb/>and repeated the studies at 25 °C. As a <lb/>control, we used a fly line that was <lb/>identical to the TRiP fly lines, but did not <lb/>have a shRNA inserted (see Table 2). All <lb/>flies where Raptor-shRNA was driven by <lb/>Mef2-GAL4 died prior to eclosion (see <lb/>Figure 3A). There was partial lethality in <lb/>the three the c179-GAL4 mediated Raptor <lb/>knockdown flies (p-value &lt; 0.005 for <lb/>those shRNA strains, with a 73-92% <lb/>decrease in the number of flies depending <lb/>on the strain, see Figure 3B). These results <lb/>indicate that the c179-GAL4 driver is less <lb/>efficient at mediating Raptor-specific <lb/>lethality than the Mef2-GAL4 and the <lb/>24B-GAL4 drivers. Interestingly, this was <lb/>not observed in mice where muscle-<lb/>specific Raptor knockout mice are <lb/>viable 35,36 . One key difference here is that <lb/>in those models, which use a late-<lb/>expressed muscle Cre driver, Raptor is not <lb/>ablated until very late in muscle <lb/>differentiation. <lb/>Muscle Raptor Knockdown Flies <lb/>Fail to Eclose from Pupae <lb/>To determine at which point prior to <lb/>eclosure the Raptor knockdown flies die, <lb/>we examined the pupal cases on the sides <lb/>of the vials from the cl79-GAL4 &gt; UAS-<lb/>Raptor-shRNA crosses and the Mef2-<lb/>GAL4 &gt; UAS-Raptor-shRNA crosses. <lb/>Twenty days after the crosses were <lb/>prepared both the empty pupal cases and <lb/>the cases containing dead flies were <lb/>counted. We observed no significant <lb/>differences in the total number of pupal <lb/>cases from either of these crosses (Figure <lb/>3C-D, p=0.416 and p=0.066 from <lb/>ANOVA respectively). In fact, we <lb/>observed a slightly increased number of <lb/>pupae from the Mef2-GAL4 &gt; UAS-<lb/>Raptor-shRNA crosses. These data <lb/>support the hypothesis that lethality <lb/>occurs after pupal development. <lb/>We next visually examined the pupal cases <lb/>for the presence dead flies (Figure 3E). <lb/>After blind scoring, we noted that for the <lb/>Mef2-GAL4 driven Raptor knockdown <lb/>Figure 3. Muscle-specific Raptor knockdown flies <lb/>die around pupal stage ~12-13 but pre-eclosure. <lb/>The graph depicts the birthrates of the progeny from <lb/>crosses of homozygous GAL4 driver lines with <lb/>homozygous Raptor shRNA transgenic flies or a <lb/>control TRiP line.

			<body>nearly 100% of the pupal cases contained <lb/>dead flies using two different anti-Raptor <lb/>shRNA lines (15 fold more dead pupae <lb/>than controls; Figure 3F). There was also <lb/>a significant number of dead flies in pupal <lb/>cases from the cl79-GAL4&gt;UAS-Raptor-<lb/>shRNA crosses (Figure 3G). Although the <lb/>absolute number of dead pupae was <lb/>variable among the shRNA-Raptor lines <lb/>using c179-GAL4, in all cases the <lb/>percentage of dead flies in pupal cases was <lb/>significantly greater than controls (Figure <lb/>3G). These results demonstrate that Raptor <lb/>knockdown in skeletal muscle produces <lb/>lethality after pupal development, but <lb/>prior to eclosure. <lb/>Lethality of Raptor knockdown in <lb/>skeletal muscle is due to an <lb/>inability to eclose from the pupal <lb/>case <lb/>To test whether the muscle Raptor <lb/>knockdown-mediated lethality is due to a <lb/>muscle weakness that prevents eclosure, <lb/>we first carefully examined fly <lb/>morphology within pupal cases. <lb/>As <lb/>shown in Figure 4A ten days after the <lb/>cross a fully formed fly is visible within <lb/>the pupal case and looks morphologically <lb/>similar to control flies. By day 14 the <lb/>control flies have completely eclosed <lb/>leaving only empty pupal cases while the <lb/>Mef2-GAL4&gt;Raptor flies are still in the <lb/>pupal case. By day 20 the flies have started <lb/>to decompose and appear dark as in <lb/>Figure 3E. <lb/>To determine if this is due to an inability <lb/>of the fly to exit the pupal case, we gently <lb/>opened 5 pupal cases by removal of the <lb/>operculum at day 10 (approximately stage <lb/>12-13 pupae) from Mef2-GAL4&gt;Raptor <lb/>knockdown flies to assist in eclosure. In 4 <lb/>out of 5 cases the flies eclosed successfully <lb/>with 3 of these animals surviving &gt;3 <lb/>weeks. To validate that these eclosure-<lb/>assisted flies had muscle weaknesses we <lb/>performed climbing assays as shown in <lb/>Figure 4B. The Mef2-GAL4&gt;Raptor flies <lb/>exhibited dramatically reduced climbing <lb/>ability as compared to controls indicating <lb/>muscle weakness (p=0.0025 by Wilcoxon <lb/>Rank Sum Test). <lb/>Effects of Muscle-Specific Raptor <lb/>Knockdown on Longevity <lb/>We next turned our attention to the few <lb/>flies that survived from the c179-GAL4 <lb/>cross. The lifespan of these Raptor <lb/>knockdown flies was measured to <lb/>determine the effects of dTORC1 <lb/>Figure 4. Mef2-GAL4 Driven Raptor Flies <lb/>Cannot Eclose from Pupal Cases. A) Flies with <lb/>Mef2-GAL4 driven knockdown of the control <lb/>shRNA or Raptor shRNA #1 were examined from <lb/>pupal stage 10 till after eclosure. By day 14 after the <lb/>cross, control flies had completely eclosed but <lb/>Raptor knockdown flies remained inside the pupal <lb/>cases. B) On day 10, (approximately pupal stage 12) <lb/>pupal cases were cut open at the operculum to assist <lb/>eclosure, then after 4 days, climbing assays were <lb/>performed on escaping flies. The flies that Mef2-<lb/>GAL4&gt;Raptor shRNA flies that eclosed with <lb/>assistance had impaired climbing. Asterisk indicates <lb/>p&lt;0.005 by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. <lb/></body>

			<body>suppression on longevity. When Raptor <lb/>was knocked down in skeletal muscle <lb/>using the c179-GAL4 driver, a large <lb/>proportion of the flies that successfully <lb/>eclosed died shortly afterwards. <lb/>Interestingly, among the flies that <lb/>survived, they generally had normal <lb/>lifespan (see Figure 5). This suggests that <lb/>there is a critical period of about 20 days <lb/>after eclosure during which the Raptor <lb/>knockdown flies are still prone to early <lb/>death. The flies that lived past this critical <lb/>period lived on to reach approximately the <lb/>same age as the controls. This was <lb/>especially dramatic for male flies for each <lb/>of these crosses (Figure 5A, C and E <lb/>compared to Figure 5B, D and F). <lb/>Effects of Muscle Specific Raptor <lb/>Knockdown on Muscle Function <lb/>To study the effects of dTORC1 <lb/>suppression on muscle function, a <lb/>climbing assay was performed on the <lb/>Raptor knockdown flies driven by the <lb/>c179-GAL4 driver at several ages. Progeny <lb/>Figure 5. Lifespan of C1 79-GAL4 Driven Raptor Knockdown Flies. Dashed lines indicate two control strains. <lb/>Each panel shows a control of C179-GAL4 crossed to the control shRNA strain, as well as the balancer containing <lb/>progeny of the C179-GAL4 homozygotes crossed to the heterozygous UAS-Raptor shRNA/TM6b flies. <lb/></body>

			<body>from each cross were individually timed <lb/>for how long it took them to climb 4 cm <lb/>up the side of the vial. The average times <lb/>for each cross are shown in Figure 6. The <lb/>results indicate that dTORC1 suppression <lb/>leads to reduced muscle function in the <lb/>flies that eclose even very early, consistent <lb/>a developmental problem in myogenesis. <lb/>Notably, these problems persist <lb/>throughout the lifespan of the fly, even in <lb/>those animals that reach adulthood and <lb/>have an average lifespan. Also interesting, <lb/>is that there was a correspondence <lb/>between the efficiency of the shRNA <lb/>strain to cause lethality and its effects on <lb/>climbing ability, indicating a potential <lb/>gene-dosage effect on both of these <lb/>phenotypes. This is consistent with other <lb/>work in flies showing a correlation <lb/>between climbing and lifespan 37-40 , <lb/>indicating that muscle strength and aging <lb/>are often linked, as is observed in <lb/>humans 41-43 . <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Summary <lb/>In this work, we have described a role for <lb/>TORC1 in the regulation of myogenesis <lb/>both in vitro and in vivo in Drosophila, that <lb/>inhibition of the dTORC1 complex results <lb/>in lethality and muscle weakness. <lb/>Together these data support an in vivo, <lb/>evolutionarily conserved role for the <lb/>TORC1 complex in muscle development. <lb/></div>
