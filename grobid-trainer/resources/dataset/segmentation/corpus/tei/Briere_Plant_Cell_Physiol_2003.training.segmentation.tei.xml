			<body>Introduction<lb/> LIM proteins have been described as developmental regulators of eukaryotic, predominantly<lb/> multicellular, organisms. Their name is derived from the three transcription factors LIN11<lb/> from Caenorhabditis elegans (Freydt et al., 1990), ISL-1 from rat (Karlsson et al., 1990), and<lb/> MEC-3 from C. elegans (Way and Chalfie, 1988). They are characterized by the presence of<lb/> one to five double zinc finger motifs [C-X2-C-X16-23-H-X2-C]-X2-[C-X2-C-X16-22-C-X2-3-<lb/>C(D,H)] -the LIM-domains – involved in protein-protein interactions (Schmeichel and<lb/> Beckerle, 1994; Dawid et al., 1998).<lb/> Based on their LIM-domain structure and organization, LIM proteins fall into four major<lb/> groups (Bach, 2000). The LIM homeodomain (LIM-hd) proteins, which contain two LIM<lb/> domains fused to a DNA-binding homeodomain, are exclusively nuclear and act as<lb/> transcription factors. The nuclear LIM-only proteins (LMO), with two LIM domains<lb/> separated by a short spacer and little else, are thought to act as molecular adapter molecules<lb/> and are involved in transcription (Wadman et al., 1997). The LIM-kinases, which display two<lb/> N-terminal LIM domains linked to a C-terminal kinase domain, participate in the regulation<lb/> of cytoskeleton dynamics (Arber et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998). The other LIM proteins form<lb/> a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group, which comprises in particular the<lb/> cystein-rich protein (CRP) subfamily.<lb/> To date several LIM-domain proteins have been described in plants including sunflower,<lb/> tobacco and Arabidopsis (Baltz et al., 1992; Mundel et al., 2000; Eliasson et al., 2000;<lb/> Kawaoka et al., 2000). They contain two structurally very similar LIM domains separated by<lb/> a longer (40-50 residue) spacer (Eliasson et al., 2000) and belong to the CRP group of LIM<lb/> proteins. In tobacco, and possibly in all other higher plants, there appear to be two isoforms,<lb/> one (PLIM) specific to pollen grains, and one (WLIM) expressed in all other tissues (Eliasson<lb/> et al., 2000). One of the sunflower proteins, HaPLIM1, was detected in the actin-enriched<lb/> germination cones of mature sunflower pollen grains (Baltz et al., 1999), while another<lb/> protein, HaWLIM1, was found in all vegetative and reproductive organs where it was<lb/> detected in many cell types and localized either to the cytoplasm, the nucleus or both. The<lb/> protein was often associated with plastids in leaf cells and stem epidermis, as well as with<lb/> small punctate structures in the perinuclear region of meristematic cells of root tips (Mundel<lb/> et al., 2000).<lb/> In this paper we report on the fine localization of sunflower LIM-domain proteins in<lb/> sunflower protoplasts. The protoplast model is indeed a simple but useful system for<lb/> investigating developmental patterns and early embryogenesis mechanisms in plants<lb/> (Petitprez et al., 1995). Our results show that sunflower protoplasts express one of the LIM-<lb/>domain protein genes (HaWLIM1) previously identified in sunflower (Mundel et al., 2000). In<lb/> interphase protoplasts, the encoded protein HaWLIM1 exhibits a dual localization, inside the<lb/> nucleus and in the cytoplasm where it colocalizes with cortical microtubules. In dividing<lb/> protoplasts, the cortical labelling is weak and exhibits no specific organization: HaWLIM1<lb/> appears to be localized mainly in the nuclear and/or perinuclear region, at a level modulated<lb/> according to the mitotic stage.<lb/> Results<lb/> Sunflower protoplasts express only HaWLIM1<lb/> Three LIM-domain protein genes have been described to date in sunflower: HaWLIM1,<lb/></body>

			<body>HaPLIM1 and HaPLIM2 (Baltz et al., 1992; Mundel et al., 2000; Eliasson et al., 2000). We<lb/> studied their expression in protoplasts by RT-PCR using primers specific for each of the three<lb/> genes. An amplification product was detected for HaWLIM1 (Fig. 1), but not for HaPLIM1<lb/> and HaPLIM2, indicating that only HaWLIM1 is expressed in sunflower protoplasts. The<lb/> amplified HaWLIM1 fragment of 565bp was directly sequenced and found to differ in only<lb/> one position (nucleotide 243) from the previously reported WLIM1 coding sequence (Mundel<lb/> et al., 2000); this nucleotide difference, which is most likely due to the different sunflower<lb/> lines used in the respective studies (HA300 vs. EMIL), leads to a one amino acid change (N to<lb/> K at position 81) in the protein.<lb/> HaWLIM1 protein polyclonal antibodies recognize a 27kDa polypeptide in sunflower<lb/> protoplasts Three different polyclonal antibodies were used in western blot experiments to detect<lb/> HaWLIM1 protein in E. coli clones expressing HaWLIM1 and in sunflower protoplasts: an<lb/> antiserum against a GST-WLIM fusion protein, and two affinity purified antibodies (A14 and<lb/> A16) against two synthetic peptides (P14 and P16) from two different regions of HaWLIM1.<lb/> In bacterial extracts the anti-serum against the GST-WLIM fusion protein recognized at least<lb/> 5 polypeptides, including one of about 50kDa as already described by Mundel et al. (2000),<lb/> and one of about 27 kDa (Fig. 2A). The two affinity purified polyclonal antibodies A14 and<lb/> A16 recognized only one polypeptide of 27kDa. In control blots (Fig. 2A, lane 3 and 5), the<lb/> signal was either completely (A14) or partially (A16) extinct by pre-incubating antibodies<lb/> with peptides P14 or P16. This indicates that A14 and A16 antibodies specifically recognize<lb/> the recombinant HaWLIM1 protein.<lb/> In protoplast extracts anti-GST-WLIM antiserum recognized a 50kDa polypeptide and a<lb/> 27kDa polypeptide as in bacterial extracts, and also other polypeptides (arrow head, Fig. 2B).<lb/> In contrast A14 and A16 recognized only one 27kDa polypeptide and this signal was<lb/> suppressed by pre-incubating the antibodies with peptides P14 or P16. The specificity of the<lb/> signal was confirmed by comparison with immunoblots incubated with the preimmune serum,<lb/> which recognized no proteins from protoplasts (results not shown). Thus, the three different<lb/> antibodies recognize in sunflower hypocotyl protoplast a 27kDa polypeptide which<lb/> corresponds to the HaWLIM1 protein.<lb/> The antiserum and purified antibodies were also used to perform immunolocalization<lb/> experiments of HaWLIM1 in 1-day-old protoplasts (Fig. 3). Protoplasts incubated with<lb/> antiserum (against the GST-fusion protein or against peptides) exhibited numerous<lb/> fluorescent spots forming a dense network and a nuclear labelling (Fig. 3a and 3b). With<lb/> affinity-purified antibodies, a similar labelling pattern was observed. However, with A14 (Fig.<lb/> 3c) fluorescent spots formed a sparse dotted pattern in the cortex and chloroplasts were<lb/> strongly labelled, whereas with A16 (Fig. 3d) the cortical labelling was intense, displaying<lb/> clear alignments of fluorescent spots, more closely resembling the antiserum labelling pattern.<lb/> The differences observed, in particular between antiserum labelling (Fig. 3b) and A14<lb/> labelling (Fig. 3c), may be due to the higher dilution of antiserum (1:2000 against 1:50 for<lb/> antibody) and to a lower concentration of A14 (&lt;8 ng/ml) than that of A16 (63 ng/ml) in the<lb/> antiserum.<lb/> The specificity of the labelling was tested by incubating protoplasts with a preimmune serum<lb/> or with affinity purified antibodies pre-incubated with peptides P14 or P16: in both cases they<lb/> showed only a very weak diffuse fluorescence (Fig. 3e and 3f).<lb/>

			HaWLIM1 labelling in interphase protoplasts<lb/> Confocal microscopy observations of labelled protoplasts provided more details on the<lb/> localization of HaWLIM1 during interphase. In order to compare the pattern of HaWLIM1<lb/> labelling with that of cytoskeleton networks, 3-day-old protoplasts were double-labelled with<lb/> A14 or A16 antibodies and anti-β-tubulin. In the following we will present examples of<lb/> labelling obtained with A16. Similar results were obtained with A14 and with the whole<lb/> protein-derived antiserum.<lb/> In the cortex, HaWLIM1 spots were frequently localized along microtubules. There was a<lb/> close similarity between the two patterns of HaWLIM1 and tubulin labelling (Fig. 4a-f). This<lb/> can be seen clearly on Fig. 4c where most HaWLIM1 spots are localized on or close to<lb/> labelled cortical microtubules. HaWLIM1 labelling decorated evenly the whole cortical<lb/> microtubule network. A dense punctate labelling pattern was also observed along cytoplasmic<lb/> strands and in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4d-f). Quantitative analysis of colocalization<lb/> frequencies calculated on 30 protoplasts revealed that on average 78.6±1.5 % of HaWLIM1<lb/> labelling colocalized with tubulin labelling.<lb/> To provide further evidence of HaWLIM1-microtubule co-localization, 1-day-old protoplasts<lb/> were incubated for 1 hour with 7 µM oryzalin in order to depolymerize microtubules.<lb/> Protoplasts were then fixed and double-labelled with anti-β-tubulin antibody and the peptide<lb/> directed antiserum. When MTs were depolymerized (Fig. 4h), the HaWLIM1 labelling<lb/> density was weak and completely disorganized (Fig. 4g) but it could still be observed<lb/> HaWLIM1 spots lying on MTs fragments (Fig. 4i). In contrast, protoplasts treated with 50<lb/> µM latrunculin B exhibited disrupted actin filaments (Fig. 4j) but neither the microtubule<lb/> network (Fig. 4k), nor the HaWLIM1 pattern (Fig. 4l) were modified.<lb/> In order to estimate the frequency of nuclear labelling in relation to the mitotic stage, DNA<lb/> labelling with Hoechst 33342 was performed on 3-day-old protoplasts previously<lb/> immunolabelled with A16 (Total number of protoplasts observed = 178). HaWLIM1 was<lb/> detected inside the nucleus of most protoplasts in interphase (92%). The labelling was either<lb/> diffuse (Fig. 4m and 4n) or constituted of a dense aggregate of spots (Fig. 4o). When present,<lb/> the nucleolus was not or very weakly labelled. In the perinuclear region HaWLIM1 proteins<lb/> appeared to be scattered, with only a few spots lying on the perinuclear network of<lb/> microtubules (Fig. 4o).<lb/> HaWLIM1 labelling in dividing protoplasts<lb/> Different patterns of HaWLIM1 labelling were observed during the progression of mitosis.<lb/> The percentage of labelled nuclei decreased progressively (72% at the beginning of prophase,<lb/> 25% in late prophase/metaphase, 8% in metaphase, 0% in anaphase), and increased again in<lb/> telophase (100% at the end of telophase). In preprophase one could still observe a dual<lb/> localisation of HaWLIM1 staining: cortical and nuclear. However, the cortical labelling<lb/> appeared as scattered spots which did not seem to present any organization. Only a few<lb/> fluorescent spots lay on or alongside the preprophase band (PPB) when present (Fig. 5a and<lb/> b). After nuclear envelope breakdown HaWLIM1 labelling was essentially distributed around<lb/> the mitotic apparatus, as seen in wide field microscopy (Fig. 5c). At metaphase, confocal<lb/> sections showed mainly a high density of fluorescent spots surrounding the mitotic spindle<lb/> (Fig. 5d) and only few spots inside or on the spindle. In anaphase/telophase only a weak and<lb/> diffuse fluorescence could be detected in the nuclear region by wide field microscopy (Fig.<lb/> 5e). Confocal observations clearly showed that this fluorescence was restricted to sparse spots<lb/> around the spindle and the early phragmoplast (Fig. 5f). In telophase, a punctate fluorescent<lb/> pattern was observed at the periphery of the phragmoplast. At the end of mitosis, daughter<lb/>

			nuclei recovered a strong labelling and the cortical labelling re-appeared (Fig. 5g and h).<lb/> Discussion<lb/> In a previous work (Mundel et al., 2000), polypeptides detected in various tissues with anti-<lb/>HaWLIM1 antibody had variable molecular weights, ranging from 34kDa to above 50kDa. It<lb/> was then suggested that HaWLIM1 was able to form oligomeric structures. In protoplast<lb/> extracts, the same antiserum detects a major band at about 52kDa and several minor bands at<lb/> lower molecular weight, in particular one at 27kDa. The only polypeptide detected using<lb/> antibodies directed against specific peptides (P14 and P16) has also a molecular weight of<lb/> 27kDa. This weight is close to the theoretical weight of HaWLIM1 (21kDa) and this small<lb/> difference in weight may be easily explained by post-translational modifications: scanning the<lb/> protein sequence against PROSITE revealed three potential glycosylation sites (one in each<lb/> LIM domain and one in C-terminal) and four potential phosphorylation sites (one in each LIM<lb/> domain, one in N-terminal and one in C-terminal). More difficult to explain is the difference<lb/> between results obtained with the antibody against the whole protein, and with peptides<lb/> directed antibodies. On one hand, it is not unlikely that the antibody directed against the<lb/> purified GST-fusion protein has a weaker specificity than peptide-directed antibodies. On the<lb/> other hand, Mundel et al. (2000) have shown that this antibody recognizes specifically a<lb/> 50kDa polypeptide in all tissues tested. But the essential result is that in hypocotyl<lb/> protoplasts, all antibodies detect the same 27kDa protein band. Thus, without excluding the<lb/> possibility of multimeric forms of the protein, our results show that HaWLIM1 is present as a<lb/> monomer in hypocotyl protoplasts.<lb/> Immunolabelling clearly indicates that HaWLIM1 exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic<lb/> localization in protoplasts. These two localizations appear to be common to at least two<lb/> groups of LIM proteins: (i) the CRP group including the plant homologues, and (ii) at least<lb/> some of the non-homeodomain, non-CRP proteins such as zyxin and LPP. Localization of<lb/> LIM proteins depends on cell differentiation status. For instance, in undifferentiated<lb/> fibroblasts, CRP3/MLP was detected exclusively in the nucleus, while in differentiated<lb/> myotubes it is present in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Arber et al., 1994 and 1996). In<lb/> contrast, the nuclear phase of zyxin and LPP is transient and can only be detected indirectly,<lb/> by using nuclear-targeted antibodies (Nix et al., 1997), or by blocking nuclear export as in the<lb/> case of the LPP protein (Petit et al., 2000). The shuttling of these normally cytoplasmic<lb/> proteins to the nucleus and back to the cytoplasm is considered to be an example of<lb/> cytoplasmic-nuclear communication.<lb/> In sunflower, a dual localization of the protein had already been reported in various sunflower<lb/> tissues (Mundel et al., 2000). Our results on hypocotyl protoplasts indicates that the location<lb/> of HaWLIM1 varies according to the developmental stage of the cell. In interphase<lb/> protoplasts, labelling was seen in both the nucleus (but not in the nucleolus) and the<lb/> cytoplasm. In dividing protoplasts, the labelling was essentially nuclear. In contrast to<lb/> previous observations by Mundel et al. (2000), the phragmoplast was only weakly labelled by<lb/> antibodies A14 and A16. This may be explained by a different specificity between affinity<lb/> purified peptide-directed antibodies and the antiserum against the whole recombinant protein<lb/> used by these authors. Furthermore, the latter recognizes several polypeptides, possibly<lb/> heterodimers, which may have a different location from that of the monomeric form of the<lb/> protein.<lb/> The localization of HaWLIM1 in punctate structures located in the perinuclear region and in<lb/> the cortical cytoplasm appears to be common to plant LIM proteins. A punctate pattern for<lb/> HaWLIM1 had been observed already in meristematic cells of sunflower root tips (Mundel et<lb/> al., 2000) and earlier studies on the pollen-specific protein HaPLIM1 had shown that the<lb/>

			protein accumulates in a limited number of small spots in microspores and in a dot-shaped<lb/> pattern in germination cones of mature pollen grains (Baltz et al., 1999). In sunflower<lb/> protoplasts, a strong colocalization of the protein with microtubules was observed. This<lb/> colocalization was particularly clear with cortical microtubules of interphase protoplasts. It is<lb/> worth noting that the best association between HaWLIM1 and cortical microtubules was<lb/> observed in 3-day old protoplasts (see Fig. 4), when they have already reorganized their<lb/> cytoskeleton and rebuilt a cell wall (Petitprez et al., 1995), and thus cannot be ascribed to the<lb/> stress involved in protoplast generation. In animal cells, CRP proteins are known to be<lb/> associated with actin-based structures. CRP/MLP proteins have been detected in focal<lb/> adhesion sites and along stress fibres in cultured fibroblasts (Louis et al., 1997; Sadler et al.,<lb/> 1992) and are thought to participate in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In cardiac<lb/> muscle MLP has been found to concentrate in the Z bands separating the sarcomers and it is<lb/> believed that this protein acts in the anchoring of actin filaments to these sites. Similar<lb/> sarcomer localization was described in the case of the Drosophila MLP proteins (Stronach et<lb/> al., 1999). Furthermore, the animal CRP and MLP proteins were shown to interact with zyxin<lb/> and alpha-actinin (Louis et al., 1997; Pomiès et al., 1997; Sadler et al., 1992), two essential<lb/> components of the actin cytoskeletal architecture. To our knowledge, the only LIM domain<lb/> protein known to associate with the microtubule cytoskeleton is paxillin. In human T<lb/> lymphoblasts, paxillin localizes to sites of cell-matrix interaction as well as to a large<lb/> perinuclear region corresponding to the microtubule organizing centre, where paxillin<lb/> colocalizes with α-and γ-tubulin (Herreros et al., 2000). In plants, it has been reported that a<lb/> γ-tubulin-related polypeptide shows a punctate localization in cortical microtubule arrays and<lb/> in the preprophase band (Liu et al., 1993 and 1995), as does HaWLIM1. In sunflower<lb/> protoplasts there is evidence for two γ-tubulin isoforms with a dual cortical and nuclear<lb/> localization (Petitprez et al., 2000). However, there is no homology between HaWLIM1 and<lb/> paxillin. Furthermore, scanning the PROSITE database did not reveal the existence of any<lb/> tubulin-binding domains in HaWLIM1. It is thus difficult to advocate a direct association<lb/> between HaWLIM1 and tubulin.<lb/> The apparent association between HaWLIM1 and microtubules might result from the<lb/> presence of fine actin filaments running alongside cortical microtubules. But disrupting the<lb/> actin with latrunculin B had no effect on this pattern, which, on the contrary, was completely<lb/> disorganized by microtubule depolymerization with oryzalin. Thus, such explanation cannot<lb/> account for the MT-like staining pattern. From another point of view, a vesicular transport of<lb/> the protein along microtubules cannot be excluded and would be consistent with the observed<lb/> punctate pattern and its disorganization by microtubule disruption.<lb/> The nuclear localization of HaWLIM1 and its variation during the cell cycle suggest a role in<lb/> gene transcription. It is known indeed that not only LIM homeodomain proteins (Wadman et<lb/> al., 1997), but also members of the CRP-type group of LIM proteins participate in gene<lb/> transcription, as is exemplified by the CRP3/MLP protein (Kong et al., 1997). Furthermore, in<lb/> tobacco, the LIM protein NtLIM1, an HaWLIM1 homolog which is involved in lignin<lb/> biosynthesis, has been shown to transiently activate the transcription of a β-gluruconidase<lb/> reporter gene (Kawaoka et al., 2000). However, a typical plant transcription factor generally<lb/> contains a DNA-binding region and a nuclear localization signal (Liu et al., 1999), two<lb/> elements which appear not to be present in HaWLIM1, as revealed by sequence analysis with<lb/> PROSITE. Nevertheless, several potential sites of phosphorylation were identified, which<lb/> could play a role in the nuclear transport of the protein and/or in its regulation (Vandromme et<lb/> al., 1996; Whitmarsh and Davis, 2000). The strong decay of the protein observed at the<lb/> transition metaphase/anaphase is also consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent<lb/> proteolysis, and it is known that degradation of transcription factors or their coregulators is an<lb/> important mechanism of transcriptional regulation (Pahl and Baeuerle, 1996). Thus, instead of<lb/>

			being a transcription factor stricto sensu, a possible role for HaWLIM1 might be to participate<lb/> to the regulation of a transcription factor complex, like for instance FHL3, a LIM-only protein<lb/> which interacts with CDC25B2 phosphatase in the nucleus (Mils et al., 2003).<lb/> In conclusion, the data on the sunflower LIM-domain protein HaWLIM1 described in the<lb/> present paper are significant at several levels: they show that the protein (a) is present in<lb/> hypocotyl protoplasts, (b) exhibits a cell cycle-dependent cytoplasmic and nuclear<lb/> localization, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, even if more work will<lb/> be necessary to fully demonstrate this hypothesis and to characterize the partner(s) of the<lb/> protein, our observations suggest the existence of a, may be indirect, interaction between<lb/> HaWLIM1 and the microtubule network.<lb/> Materials and Methods<lb/> Plant material<lb/> Seeds of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L., genotype EMIL Pioneer France Maïs) were<lb/> sterilized in 5% calcium hypochloride for 20 min, then rinsed in sterile water and cultivated<lb/> on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) at 25°C under a 16-hour photoperiod (light<lb/> intensity 25µE.m -2 .s -1 ). Protoplasts were isolated from 8-day old plantlet hypocotyls<lb/> according to the protocol of Chanabé et al. (1989). After purification, protoplasts were<lb/> embedded at a final density of 1.5 10 5 .mL -1 in TLD medium (Chanabé et al., 1991) containing<lb/> 0.5% Sea Plaque agarose (FMC Bioproduct, Rockland, USA), and before solidification small<lb/> drops (40 µl) of this mix were spread on poly-L-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverglasses. After<lb/> solidification of the drops, embedded protoplasts were submerged in 1mL of TLD medium<lb/> and cultured in the dark at 25°C.<lb/> RNA isolation<lb/> RNA isolation was performed according to Shepherd et al. (1983) with a few modifications.<lb/> Protoplasts were ground in extraction buffer (25 mM sodium citrate, 5 M guanidium<lb/> thiocyanate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 2 mM EDTA, 5%  mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, pH 7.0). After<lb/> phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction, the aqueous phase was isolated by centrifugation (10 min<lb/> at 9000 x g and 4°C) and the nucleic acids were precipitated overnight at -20°C by adding<lb/> 0.05 vol. 1M acetic acid and 0.7 vol. absolute ethanol. After centrifugation (10 min at 9000 x<lb/> g and 4°C), RNAs were specifically precipitated by addition of 2M lithium chloride, then<lb/> mixed with 3 M sodium acetate and incubated for 2 hours at -20°C in 70% ethanol. Next,<lb/> RNAs were dried and resuspended in sterile water. Residual DNA was eliminated by<lb/> treatment with DNAse (DNAse RNAse free RQ1, Promega) according to the<lb/> recommendations of the provider. Enzymes were removed by phenol/chloroform (1:1)<lb/> extraction.<lb/> RT-PCR expression studies<lb/> First strand cDNAs were synthesized from protoplast mRNAs using the &quot;Advantage RT for<lb/> PCR&quot; kit (Clontech). The following specific oligonucleotide primer sets were used to detect<lb/> possible transcripts for the three sunflower proteins: 5&apos;-ATGGCATTTGCAGGCACT-<lb/>ACCCAGAAATGCATGGC-3&apos; and 5&apos;-TCAAGGTGCGGTTTCTCCGACCCTTGCAGAAC-<lb/>GCT-3&apos; for HaWLIM1, 5&apos;-ATGAAATCATTCACAGGAACAACC-3&apos; and 5&apos;-GAAACTTCA-<lb/>TCATATCGAGCTATTA-3&apos; for HaPLIM1, and 5&apos;-TGATTGTTGGTTCTGCCCAACTA-3&apos;<lb/> and 5&apos;-CAATGACATACAACAGTTGTATAGACA-3&apos; for HaPLIM2. The initial<lb/> denaturation step (95°C for 5 min) was followed by 35 amplification cycles (95°C for 1 min;<lb/>

			50°C for 1 min; 72°C for 2 min) and a final elongation step (72°C for 15 min) in a Perkin<lb/> Elmer thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were analysed by agarose gel<lb/> (0.8%) electrophoresis and then sequenced by Genome Express (Grenoble, France).<lb/> Antibodies Three different polyclonal antibodies were used for immunodetection and immunocytology.<lb/> HaWLIM1-antiserum against the GST-fusion protein was obtained as described in Mundel et<lb/> al. (2000). An antiserum and two other antibodies (A14 and A16) were obtained by CovaLab<lb/> (Lyon, France). They were directed against two synthetic peptides designed in regions of the<lb/> protein non homologous to other LIM proteins: one (P14) in the C-terminal part<lb/> (CLEGERSARVGETA), the other one (P16) in the inter-LIM domain<lb/> (CDQLFKKTGSLDKSFE). After synthesis and purification (up to 85%) these two peptides<lb/> were bound to KLH carrier protein and mixed with Freund&apos;s adjuvant. One rabbit was<lb/> immunized with this mix by three intra-dermal injections at three-week intervals and one<lb/> subcutaneous injection at day 63. The immune serum was obtained after 74 days. The titre of<lb/> the antiserum was assessed by ELISA test and amounted to 32000. A14 and A16 antibodies<lb/> were obtained by affinity purification of the immune serum against peptides P14 and P16.<lb/> Expression of HaWLIM1 in recombinant bacteria<lb/> An E. coli clone expressing the GST-HaWLIM1 fusion protein was obtained as described in<lb/> Mundel et al. (2000). Protein production and purification of the GST-fusion protein on GSH-<lb/>Sepharose beads was carried out with the GST Gene Fusion System (Pharmacia Biotech).<lb/> After purification, cleavage of HaWLIM1 from GST was achieved using thrombin.<lb/> Western blot analysis of HaWLIM1 expression<lb/> Protoplasts were suspended in Laemmli (1970) buffer containing 4%(v/v) β-mercaptoethanol<lb/> and 2%(w/v) polyvinyl-polypyrolidone. They were lysed by sonication (Vibra Cell, Bioblock<lb/> Scientific) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15000 x g to eliminate cell fragments. Total proteins<lb/> in the supernatant were precipitated at -20°C by adding 3 vol. 80% acetone, and the insoluble<lb/> fraction washed three times in 80% acetone. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in<lb/> denaturating conditions by migration in a 12 % acrylamide gel. After migration, proteins were<lb/> transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham). Membranes were<lb/> incubated for 2 h with anti-HaWLIM1, A14 or A16 antibodies in PBS buffer containing 0.1%<lb/> Tween 80 and 1% milk powder. After three washes in the same buffer, membranes were<lb/> exposed to anti-rabbit IgG goat antibodies coupled to RHP peroxydase (Promega) diluted to<lb/> 1:5000 and revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham). Controls of specificity<lb/> have been done by pre-incubating A14 and A16 antibodies with corresponding peptides<lb/> (1:200) for 2h.<lb/> Immunolocalization Protoplasts were fixed for 1 h in MSB buffer (Traas, 1989) supplemented with 2%<lb/> paraformaldehyde and 0.03% glutaraldehyde. Proteins were stained according Caumont et al.<lb/> (1997) by overnight incubation at room temperature with either rabbit HaWLIM1-antiserum<lb/> (dilution 1:5000), or antiserum against peptides P14 and P16 (dilution 1:2000), or affinity<lb/> purified primary antibodies A14 (dilution 1:100) or A16 (dilution 1:50). In the case of double<lb/> labelling, mouse monoclonal antibody (Amersham) directed against β-tubulin (dilution 1:125)<lb/> was added. After washing, protoplasts were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with FITC-<lb/>labelled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (dilution 1:50) and with Texas Red labelled anti-mouse<lb/> IgG antibodies (dilution 1:50) from Amersham. After rinsing, coverglasses were mounted in<lb/> an anti-fading buffer (Citifluor, Link Analytical). For negative controls, the same procedure<lb/>

			was followed but without the addition of primary antibodies or by adding the preimmune<lb/> serum in place of the primary antibodies at the same concentration. Specificity controls were<lb/> made by pre-incubating the primary antibodies A14 (dilution 1:100) and A16 (dilution 1:50)<lb/> with corresponding peptides P14 (2.3 mg/mL) and P16 (6 mg/mL) respectively for 2h before<lb/> immunolabelling.<lb/> In some experiments, protoplasts were pre-treated with oryzalin or latrunculin B, which are<lb/> known to depolymerize microtubules (Galway and Hardham, 1989) or to disrupt actin<lb/> filaments (Gibbon et al., 1999) in plant cells, respectively. One-day-old protoplasts were<lb/> incubated with 7µM oryzalin or 50µM latrunculin B for 1h. They were then fixed and double<lb/> labelled as described above. Disruption of the actin network was checked by indirect<lb/> immunolabelling with mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (dilution 1:125) and Texas<lb/> Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (dilution 1:50) from Amersham.<lb/> Nucleus staining was performed by incubating protoplasts in an aqueous solution of 0.2µg/ml<lb/> Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 10 min after the immunolabelling treatment.<lb/> Microscopy and image analysis<lb/> For conventional fluorescence microscopy, observations were made with a Leitz Laborlux<lb/> microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with epifluorescence illumination (for<lb/> Hoechst: excitation filter BP340-380, emission filter LP440, for FITC: excitation filter<lb/> BP450-490, emission filter LP520, and for Texas Red: excitation filter 530-560 nm, emission<lb/> filter LP580 ). Images were acquired using a PL APO 40x/1.32 oil objective lens (Leica) .<lb/> Confocal observations were made with a TCS SP2 confocal laser microscope (Leica,<lb/> Heidelberg, Germany). Image acquisition was achieved with a HCX PL APO 40x/1.25 Leica<lb/> objective lens in scan mode and image averaging of 3 frames. For FITC the 488 nm line of an<lb/> argon laser was used and the emission window set to 510–530nm. For Texas Red, the 543nm<lb/> line of a Helium/Neon laser was used and the emission window set to 600-700nm.<lb/> Quantification of colocalization of HaWLIM1 with tubulin was carried out on confocal<lb/> sections of double-labelled protoplasts. For each section two confocal images (one for<lb/> HaWLIM1 labelling, the other one for actin or tubulin labelling) were recorded in sequential<lb/> mode to avoid cross talking. Images were analysed with image processing software ImagePro<lb/> Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA). After thresholding the images to eliminate<lb/> background fluorescence, a region of interest (ROI) was carefully hand-designed inside the<lb/> protoplast area, excluding chloroplasts and the nuclear region. Then, the colocalization<lb/> coefficients were calculated according to the method described by Manders et al. (1992).<lb/> Results presented are mean percentages calculated on 30 image pairs analysed in the same<lb/> conditions.<lb/>
