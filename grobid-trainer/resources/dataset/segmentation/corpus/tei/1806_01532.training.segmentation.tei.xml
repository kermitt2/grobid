			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Searches for diboson resonances provide an essential test of <lb/>theories of electroweak symmetry breaking beyond the Standard <lb/>Model (BSM). Vector resonances are predicted in various BSM sce-<lb/>narios, such as in extended gauge models [1,2], Little Higgs mod-<lb/>els [3], Composite Higgs models and walking technicolor [4-6], <lb/>unitarized Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian models [7], as well as <lb/>in theories with extra dimensions [8-10]. In addition, new scalar <lb/>diboson resonances result from models with an extended Higgs <lb/>sector [11,12]. This Letter reports on a search for a W Z resonance <lb/>in the fully leptonic decay channel ν <lb/>( = e or μ), produced <lb/>either by quark-antiquark (q q) fusion or by vector-boson fusion <lb/>(VBF). The proton-proton collision data were collected by the AT-<lb/>LAS detector [13] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre-<lb/>of-mass energy <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV. <lb/>Parameterized Lagrangians [14-16] incorporating a heavy vec-<lb/>tor triplet (HVT) permit the interpretation of searches for vector <lb/>resonances in a generic way. Here, the simplified phenomenologi-<lb/>cal Lagrangian of Ref. [15] is used. The coupling of the new heavy <lb/>vector resonance, V , to the Higgs boson and the Standard Model <lb/>(SM) gauge bosons is parameterized by g V c H and to the fermions <lb/>via the combination (g 2 /g V )c F , where g is the SM SU(2) gauge <lb/>coupling. The parameter g V represents the typical strength of the <lb/>vector-boson interaction, while the parameters c H and c F are ex-<lb/>pected to be of the order of unity in most models. The vector-<lb/>boson scattering process, pp → V jj → W Z jj, is only sensitive to <lb/>the gauge boson coupling and, in this case, the benchmark model <lb/></body>

			<body>used to interpret the results assumes no coupling of the heavy vec-<lb/>tor resonance to fermions. <lb/>The Georgi-Machacek model (GM) [17,18] is used as a bench-<lb/>mark for a singly charged scalar resonance. The model extends <lb/>the Higgs sector by including one real and one complex triplet, <lb/>while preserving custodial symmetry, ensuring that the parame-<lb/>ter ρ = M 2 <lb/>W /(M 2 <lb/>Z cos 2 θ W ) = 1 at tree level. It is less experimen-<lb/>tally constrained [19,20] than other models with higher isospin <lb/>representations, such as Little Higgs models or Left-Right sym-<lb/>metric models [21]. A parameter sin θ H , representing the mixing <lb/>of the vacuum expectation values, determines the contribution of <lb/>the triplets to the masses of the W and Z bosons. The ten physi-<lb/>cal scalar states are organized into different custodial multiplets: a <lb/>fiveplet (H ++ <lb/>5 , H + <lb/>5 , H 0 <lb/>5 , H − <lb/>5 , H −− <lb/>5 ) which is fermiophobic but cou-<lb/>ples to W Z, a triplet, and two singlets, one of which is identified <lb/>as the 125 GeV SM Higgs boson. Assuming that the triplet states <lb/>are heavier than the fiveplet scalars, H 5 can only be produced by <lb/>vector-boson fusion and the cross section is proportional to sin 2 θ H . <lb/>The singly charged members of this fiveplet are the object of the <lb/>present search in the VBF channel. For both models the intrinsic <lb/>width of the resonance is below 4%, which is lower than the ex-<lb/>perimental resolution in nearly all the parameter space explored in <lb/>the present analysis. <lb/>The VBF process (pp → W Z jj) is characterized by the presence <lb/>of two jets with a large rapidity gap resulting from quarks from <lb/>which a vector boson has been radiated. The absence of this topol-<lb/>ogy is interpreted as q q production, collectively referred to here as <lb/>q q. The spectrum of the reconstructed invariant mass of the W Z <lb/>resonance candidates is examined for localized excesses over the <lb/>expected SM background. Results are provided for the VBF and q <lb/></body>

			<body>categories separately, neglecting possible signal leakage between <lb/>them. <lb/>Early results from the Tevatron [22,23] have put limits on the <lb/>mass of a W boson of an extended gauge model [2] in the <lb/>W Z channel between 180 GeV and 690 GeV. The present analy-<lb/>sis extends the search for resonant W Z production beyond that <lb/>in Run 1 pp collision data at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 8 TeV performed by the <lb/></body>

			<body>ATLAS [24] and CMS [25] collaborations. Each collaboration has <lb/>combined results [26-28] from searches for heavy V V and V H <lb/>resonances (V = W or Z ) based on Run 1 data and on partial <lb/>Run 2 data at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV in the fully hadronic (qqqq), semilep-<lb/>tonic ( νqq, qq, ννqq), and fully leptonic ( <lb/>, ν , νν) final <lb/>states. More recent results from V V and V H resonance searches <lb/>with data at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV have been reported in Refs. [29-38]. <lb/>The various decay channels generally differ in sensitivity in differ-<lb/>ent mass regions. The fully leptonic channel, in spite of a lower <lb/>branching ratio, is expected to be particularly sensitive to low-<lb/>mass resonances as it has lower backgrounds. A recent search [39] <lb/>by the CMS Collaboration for a charged Higgs boson produced <lb/>by vector-boson fusion and decaying into W Z in the fully lep-<lb/>tonic mode, using 15.2 fb −1 of data collected at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV, has <lb/>yielded limits on the coupling parameter of the GM model, as a <lb/>function of mass. Limits on the GM model have also been set, <lb/>based on analyses of same-charge W W production by CMS [40] <lb/>and opposite-charge W W production by ATLAS [41], using data at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb −1 . <lb/>2. ATLAS detector <lb/>The ATLAS detector at the LHC has a cylindrical geometry with <lb/>a near 4π coverage in solid angle. 1 The inner detector (ID), con-<lb/>sisting of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip and transition radiation <lb/>detectors, is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid pro-<lb/>viding a 2 T axial magnetic field. It allows precise reconstruction of <lb/>tracks from charged particles and measurement of their momenta <lb/>up to a pseudorapidity of |η| = 2.5. High-granularity lead/liquid-<lb/>argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic and steel/scintillator-tile <lb/>hadron calorimeters, at larger radius, provide energy measure-<lb/>ments in the central pseudorapidity range |η| &lt; 1.7. In the end-<lb/>cap and forward regions, LAr calorimeters for both the EM and <lb/>hadronic energy measurements extend the region of angular ac-<lb/>ceptance up to |η| = 4.9. Outside the calorimeters, the muon <lb/>spectrometer incorporates multiple layers of trigger and tracking <lb/>chambers in a magnetic field produced by a system of supercon-<lb/>ducting toroid magnets, enabling an independent precise measure-<lb/>ment of muon track momenta for |η| &lt; 2.7. The ATLAS trigger <lb/>system consists of a hardware-based level-1 trigger followed by a <lb/>software-based high-level trigger [42]. <lb/>3. Data and Monte Carlo samples <lb/>The data used in this analysis were collected during 2015 and <lb/>2016 with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass <lb/>energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. The minimum bunch crossing in-<lb/>terval is 25 ns, with a mean number of 23 additional interactions <lb/>per bunch crossing. The events are required to have passed combi-<lb/>nations of single-electron or single-muon triggers. The transverse <lb/></body>

			<body>momentum threshold of the leptons in 2015 is 24 GeV for elec-<lb/>trons and 20 GeV for muons satisfying a loose isolation require-<lb/>ment based only on ID track information. Due to the higher instan-<lb/>taneous luminosity in 2016 the trigger threshold was increased to <lb/>26 GeV for both electrons and muons and tighter isolation require-<lb/>ments were applied. Additional electron and muon triggers that <lb/>do not include any isolation requirements with transverse momen-<lb/>tum thresholds of p T = 60 GeV and 50 GeV, and a single-electron <lb/>trigger requiring p T &gt; 120 GeV with less restrictive electron iden-<lb/>tification criteria are used to increase the selection efficiency which <lb/>reaches close to 100%. Events are accepted only if quality criteria <lb/>for detector and data conditions are satisfied. With these condi-<lb/>tions, the available datasets correspond to an integrated luminosity <lb/>of 36.1 fb −1 . <lb/>Samples of simulated data were produced by Monte Carlo <lb/>(MC) generators with the detector response obtained from the <lb/>Geant4 toolkit [43,44]. For some samples, the calorimeter response <lb/>is obtained from a fast parameterized simulation [45], instead <lb/>of Geant4. Additional simulated inelastic pp collisions, generated <lb/>with Pythia 8.186 [46] with the A2 set of tuned parameters [47] <lb/>and the MSTW2008LO [48] parton distribution function (PDF), <lb/>were overlaid in order to model both the in-and out-of-time ef-<lb/>fects from additional pp collisions (pile-up) in the same and neigh-<lb/>bouring bunch crossings. The mean number of pile-up events in <lb/>the MC samples was set to reflect the conditions in the data. <lb/>For the HVT interpretation, W → W Z samples were gener-<lb/>ated. Two benchmark models, provided in Ref. [15], are used. In <lb/>Model A, weakly coupled vector resonances arise from an exten-<lb/>sion of the SM gauge group [49] with an additional SU(2) sym-<lb/>metry group and the branching fractions to fermions and gauge <lb/>bosons are comparable. In Model B, the heavy vector triplet is <lb/>produced in a strongly coupled scenario, as in a Composite Higgs <lb/>model [50] and fermionic couplings are suppressed. The parame-<lb/>ter g V was set to 1 for Model A and to 3 for Model B. For both <lb/>models, the parameter c F is assumed to be the same for all types <lb/>of fermions. Simulated signal samples for the HVT benchmark <lb/>Model A were generated for masses of vector resonances ranging <lb/>from 250 GeV to 3 TeV with MadGraph_aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [51], us-<lb/>ing the model file provided by the authors in Ref. [52] with the <lb/>NNPDF23LO [53] PDF set. They are hadronized with Pythia 8.186. <lb/>For interpretation in terms of Model B, the Model A cross sections <lb/>are simply scaled. This is justified since the width remains well be-<lb/>low the experimental resolution and the angular distributions are <lb/>the same for both models. <lb/>For the VBF production channel, HVT samples were generated <lb/>with g V = 1 for masses ranging from 250 GeV to 2 TeV. The cou-<lb/>pling parameter c H was set to 1 and all other couplings of the <lb/>heavy triplet, including c F , were set to 0 in order to maximize the <lb/>VBF contribution. A dijet invariant mass of at least 150 GeV was <lb/>required during event generation. <lb/>For the GM signal samples, pp → H ± <lb/>5 jj → W ± Z jj were pro-<lb/>duced with MadGraph_aMC@NLO 2.2.2 for the mass range 200 to <lb/>900 GeV in the H 5 -plane defined in [54], compatible with present <lb/>limits [20,55], using GMCALC [56] and with sin θ H = 0.5. They <lb/>were produced at leading order, but normalized to next-to-leading <lb/>order according to Ref. [11], where the cross sections and widths, <lb/>which scale as sin 2 θ H , are also given. For these samples, a min-<lb/>imum p T of 15 GeV (10 GeV) for the jets (leptons) was required <lb/>during event generation and the pseudorapidity must be in the <lb/>range |η| &lt; 5 for jets and |η| &lt; 2.7 for leptons. <lb/>The background sources in this analysis include processes with <lb/>two or more electroweak gauge bosons, namely V V and V V V as <lb/>well as processes with top quarks, such as t t, t tV , single top and <lb/>t Z , and processes with gauge bosons produced in association with <lb/>jets or photons ( Z + j and Z γ ).

			<body>the contribution from background processes with three or more <lb/>prompt leptons while data-driven techniques are used for the case <lb/>of background processes with at least one misidentified or non-<lb/>prompt lepton. Simulated events are used for cross checks and to <lb/>assess the systematic uncertainties in these backgrounds. <lb/>The dominant W Z SM background process of order (α 2 α 2 <lb/>s ) in-<lb/>volving colour-exchange diagrams, here referred to as QCD W Z, <lb/>was modelled using Sherpa 2.2.2 [57] at next-to-leading order <lb/>(NLO), and includes hard-scattering, parton shower, hadronization <lb/>and the underlying events. Up to three additional partons gener-<lb/>ated at tree level were merged with the parton shower. In order to <lb/>estimate an uncertainty due to the parton shower modelling, two <lb/>alternative W Z samples were produced using Powheg-Box v2 [58] <lb/>interfaced with Pythia 8.186 and Herwig++ [59], respectively. <lb/>A sample of the purely electroweak process W Z jj → ν <lb/>jj (la-<lb/>belled W Z jj) with a matrix-element b-quark veto (at zero order <lb/>in α s ) was generated separately with Sherpa 2.2.2. Contributions <lb/>from W Z jb → ν <lb/>bj (labelled W Zbj) are included in the t Z <lb/>sample described below. To estimate an uncertainty due to the <lb/>parton shower modelling an alternative Madgraph+Pythia 8 sam-<lb/>ple was produced. This Madgraph sample includes b-quarks in the <lb/>initial state and was split to provide a sample without (with) a <lb/>b-quark in the final state to model the W Z jj (t Z + W Zbj) back-<lb/>ground. <lb/>Samples of q q → Z Z → 4 or q q → Z Z → <lb/>νν were gener-<lb/>ated by Powheg-Box v2 at NLO, interfaced to Pythia 8.186 and <lb/>normalized to NNLO by K -factors evaluated in Ref. [60]. The gg → <lb/>Z Z and tribosons were generated with Sherpa 2.1.1. The t tV and <lb/>t Z processes were generated at LO using Madgraph_aMC@NLO, in-<lb/>terfaced with Pythia 8.186 (t tV ) and Pythia 6.428 (t Z ). The t tV <lb/>samples were normalized to NLO predictions [11]. <lb/>Finally samples of SM backgrounds with at least one misiden-<lb/>tified or non-prompt lepton, including Z γ , W γ , Drell-Yan Z → <lb/>, W → ν as well as top-pair and single-top were gener-<lb/>ated to assist in the fake/non-prompt lepton background estimate. <lb/>Events with Z γ and W γ in the final state were generated with <lb/>Sherpa 2.1.1. Drell-Yan Z → , W → ν as well as top-pair and <lb/>single-top production channels were generated with Powheg-Box <lb/>v2 and hadronized with Pythia. To avoid double counting the Z γ <lb/>events, Z events produced by the Drell-Yan process with a photon <lb/>from final-state radiation with p T &gt; 10 GeV were removed. The <lb/>parton shower for processes with top quarks was modelled with <lb/>Pythia 6.428. Madgraph_aMC@NLO and Pythia 8.186 were used <lb/>for background processes involving a pair of top quarks accompa-<lb/>nied by a W boson or by a pair of charged leptons. The Z and <lb/>single-top cross sections were normalized to NNLO by K -factors <lb/>evaluated in Ref. [60,61]. <lb/>SM backgrounds with Higgs bosons (H, t tH, V H) contribute <lb/>less than 0.1% of the total background because of the low cross <lb/>section and the requirement of a well reconstructed Z boson de-<lb/>caying leptonically. These backgrounds are neglected. <lb/>4. Reconstructed objects <lb/>Events are required to have at least one primary vertex with <lb/>at least two associated tracks, each with transverse momentum <lb/>p T &gt; 0.4 GeV. If there is more than one vertex reconstructed in <lb/>the event, the one with the largest track <lb/>p 2 <lb/>T is chosen as the <lb/>hard-scatter primary vertex and is subsequently used for the re-<lb/>construction of electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse mo-<lb/>mentum. <lb/>Electron candidates are reconstructed from energy deposits in <lb/>the EM calorimeter which are matched to a well-reconstructed <lb/>ID track originating from the primary vertex. The electron iden-<lb/>tification is based on a likelihood evaluated from a multivariate <lb/>discriminant. They are categorized as satisfying the medium or the <lb/>tight reconstruction quality requirements, as defined in Ref. [62]. <lb/>Only electrons with transverse energy E T &gt; 25 GeV in the pseudo-<lb/>rapidity range |η| &lt; 2.47 are considered in this analysis. The candi-<lb/>date electrons are required to pass an isolation condition: an upper <lb/>value of the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the tracks <lb/>with p T &gt; 0.4 GeV in a cone of size R = min(0.2, 10 GeV/E T ) <lb/>around the electron, excluding the track of the electron itself, is <lb/>chosen such that the efficiency is constant at 99% for electrons in <lb/>Z → ee events. For tight electrons, an isolation requirement is im-<lb/>posed, based on calorimeter as well as track variables, which varies <lb/>as a function of transverse energy and yields an efficiency between <lb/>95% and 99% for electrons with p T in the range 25-60 GeV. For <lb/>a pair of electrons sharing the same ID-track, the electron with <lb/>higher cluster E T is kept. <lb/>Muons are reconstructed by combining tracks from the inner <lb/>detector with tracks from the muon spectrometer. They are re-<lb/>quired to satisfy medium or tight quality requirements, as defined <lb/>in Ref. [63]. Only muons with p T &gt; 25 GeV and |η| &lt; 2.7 are <lb/>considered in this analysis. Isolation requirements are also ap-<lb/>plied to all muons, based on the ratio p varcone <lb/>T <lb/>/p <lb/>μ <lb/>T , where p varcone <lb/>T <lb/>is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the tracks with <lb/>p T &gt; 1 GeV in a cone of size R = min(10 GeV/p <lb/>μ <lb/>T , 0.3) around <lb/>the muon, excluding the muon track itself. This isolation gives 99% <lb/>efficiency, independently of η or p μ <lb/>T , in Z → μμ samples. <lb/>Electron and muon candidates are required to originate from <lb/>the primary vertex. Thus, the significance of the track&apos;s transverse <lb/>impact parameter calculated relative to the beam line, |d 0 /σ d 0 |, <lb/>must be less than three for muons and less than five for electrons, <lb/>and the longitudinal impact parameter, z 0 (the difference between <lb/>the value of z of the point on the track at which d 0 is defined <lb/>and the longitudinal position of the primary vertex), is required to <lb/>satisfy |z 0 • sin(θ )| &lt; 0.5 mm. <lb/>Jets are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposition in the <lb/>calorimeter [64] using the anti-k t algorithm [65] with a radius pa-<lb/>rameter R = 0.4. Events with jets arising from detector noise or <lb/>other non-collision sources are discarded [66]. This search consid-<lb/>ers jets with p T &gt; 30 GeV in the range |η| &lt; 4.5. Furthermore, <lb/>to mitigate the pile-up contamination, a jet vertex tagger [67], <lb/>based on information about tracks associated with the primary <lb/>vertex and pile-up vertices, is applied to jets with p T &lt; 60 GeV <lb/>and |η| &lt; 2.4. The selected working point provides at least 92% <lb/>efficiency. The energy of each jet is calibrated and corrected for <lb/>detector effects using a combination of simulated events and in <lb/>situ methods in 13 TeV data [68]. <lb/>As lepton and jet candidates can be reconstructed from the <lb/>same detector information, a procedure to resolve overlap ambi-<lb/>guities is applied. If an electron and a muon share the same ID <lb/>track, the muon is selected. Reconstructed jets which overlap with <lb/>electrons or muons in a cone of size R = 0.2 are removed. <lb/>Jets containing b-hadrons are identified as b-jets by the MV2c10 <lb/>b-tagging algorithm [69], which uses information such as track <lb/>impact-parameter significances and positions of explicitly recon-<lb/>structed secondary decay vertices. A working point corresponding <lb/>to 85% b-tagging efficiency on a sample of t t events is chosen [70], <lb/>with a light-flavour jet rejection factor of about 34 and a c-jet re-<lb/>jection of about 3. Correction factors are applied to the simulated <lb/>event samples to compensate for differences between data and <lb/>simulation in the b-tagging efficiency for b-jets, c-jets and light-<lb/>flavour jets. <lb/>The missing transverse momentum, p miss <lb/>T <lb/>, and its magnitude <lb/>E miss <lb/>T <lb/>, are calculated from the imbalance in the sum of visible <lb/>transverse momenta of reconstructed physics objects: electrons, <lb/>muons and jets, as well as a &quot;soft&quot; term reconstructed from tracks <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 1. The signal selection acceptance times efficiency (A× ), defined as the ratio of the number of MC signal events in the VBF category to the number of generated signal <lb/>events, is presented as a function of the resonance mass. Fig. 1(a) corresponds to the GM Model H ± <lb/>5 while Fig. 1(b) corresponds to the HVT models. The A× is shown for <lb/>each decay channel and the sum of all lepton flavour combinations (inclusive). The error bars shown in each figure represent the total statistical and systematic uncertainties. <lb/>compatible with the primary vertex and not associated with any of <lb/>those objects [71,72]. <lb/>5. Event selection <lb/>Preselection criteria are first applied to all the event samples. <lb/>The presence of three prompt leptons is required, two of which <lb/>will be associated with the Z boson, and are required to satisfy the <lb/>medium quality requirement (Section 4). The Z boson candidate is <lb/>reconstructed from the two leptons of same flavour and opposite <lb/>charge, whose invariant mass is closest to the on-shell mass m Z , <lb/>and in the range |m − m Z | &lt; 20 GeV. The third lepton, associated <lb/>with the W boson decay, is required to satisfy the tight quality <lb/>criteria to enhance the background rejection. To ensure that the <lb/>trigger efficiency is well determined, at least one of the candidate <lb/>leptons is required to have p T &gt; 27 GeV. <lb/>To suppress background processes with at least four prompt <lb/>leptons, events with a fourth lepton candidate satisfying looser <lb/>selection criteria are rejected. For this looser selection, the require-<lb/>ment on the minimum p T of the leptons is lowered to p T &gt; 7 GeV <lb/>and medium identification requirements are used for both the elec-<lb/>trons and muons. <lb/>Since there is a neutrino in the signal events, E miss <lb/>T <lb/>&gt; 25 GeV is <lb/>also required. The third lepton and the missing transverse momen-<lb/>tum are assumed to result from the W boson decay. The longitu-<lb/>dinal momentum p ν <lb/>z of the neutrino is calculated by requiring that <lb/>the invariant mass of the lepton-neutrino system be equal to the <lb/>W mass. The solution results in a quadratic equation which leads <lb/>to two possible solutions. If they are real, the one with the smaller <lb/>|p ν <lb/>z | is chosen since it was found to provide a better agreement <lb/>with the truth. Otherwise, the real part is chosen. The invariant <lb/>mass, m W Z , of the W Z resonance candidate is then reconstructed <lb/>using the chosen solution for p ν <lb/>z along with the four-momenta of <lb/>the three charged leptons. <lb/>The selected events are then separated into two categories tar-<lb/>geting different production mechanisms: VBF and q q. The VBF cat-<lb/>egory contains events with two or more jets with p T &gt; 30 GeV <lb/>which fail the b-tagging requirements described in Section 4. The <lb/>dijet pair defined by the two highest-p T jets in the event must <lb/>also have large η separation (| η jj | &gt; 3.5) and an invariant m jj <lb/>above 500 GeV. If more than two jets are found in an event, the <lb/>two highest-p T jets are considered. By imposing a b-jet veto, back-<lb/>grounds containing one or more top quarks, including t t, t t + W /Z , <lb/>and t Z are suppressed. <lb/>The net acceptance times efficiency (A× ) of the selection, rel-<lb/>ative to signal events generated for H ± <lb/>5 and HVT models in the <lb/>Fig. 2. The signal selection acceptance times efficiency (A× ), defined as the ratio <lb/>of the number of MC signal events in the q q category to the number of generated <lb/>signal events, as a function of the HVT resonance mass. The error bars represent the <lb/>total statistical and systematic uncertainties. <lb/>VBF category is shown in Fig. 1. The generation of the GM Model <lb/>H ± <lb/>5 events had the following requirements: p T (jets) &gt; 15 GeV, p T <lb/>(leptons) &gt; 10 GeV, |η|(jets) &lt; 5 and |η|(leptons) &lt; 2.7. Decays <lb/>of W bosons into all lepton flavours, and of Z bosons into e + e − <lb/>and μ + μ − , were simulated. The Z → τ + τ − decays give a neg-<lb/>ligible contribution and were not included in the simulation, but <lb/>the A× shown was scaled to include all decays. For the HVT VBF <lb/>samples, m jj &gt; 150 GeV was required at generator level. Decays of <lb/>W and Z bosons into all flavours of leptons were included. For <lb/>HVT and H ± <lb/>5 the A× falls in the range 2-8% and 3-12% respec-<lb/>tively for resonance masses ranging between 200 and 900 GeV, the <lb/>difference being due, with approximately equal importance, to the <lb/>generator level selection and to the different angular distributions <lb/>of the final products. <lb/>The remaining events are assigned to the q q category signal <lb/>region. For this category, the W and Z bosons from a resonance <lb/>produced in the s-channel with m W Z larger than 250 GeV are ex-<lb/>pected to have transverse momenta close to 50% of its mass. The <lb/>requirements p W <lb/>T /m W Z &gt; 0.35 and p Z <lb/>T /m W Z &gt; 0.35 enhance the <lb/>sensitivity to the signal. The overall selection efficiency relative to <lb/>generated event increases from about 15% to 25% for resonances <lb/>masses ranging from 500 GeV to 3 TeV as illustrated in Fig. 2. <lb/>Decays of W and Z bosons into all flavours of leptons are in-<lb/>cluded at event generation. The A× values decrease for resonance <lb/>masses above approximately 2 TeV due to the collinearity of elec-<lb/>trons from the Z → ee decays which spoils the isolation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 3. Observed and expected distributions of the W Z invariant mass in (a) the q q validation region and (b) the VBF validation region. The points correspond to the data <lb/>and the histograms to the expectations for the different SM processes. The uncertainty in the total background prediction, shown as bands, combines statistical, theory and <lb/>systematic contributions. The bin sizes were chosen to reflect the resolution of a reconstructed signal, and the width of the previous to last bin is used to scale the bin <lb/>contents. The last bin contains the overflow. <lb/>6. Background estimation <lb/>The dominant background in the resonance search is the SM <lb/>production of W Z. Its normalization and shape are estimated from <lb/>MC and validated in dedicated validation regions by comparing the <lb/>data and MC distributions. Events in the validation regions are se-<lb/>lected in exactly the same way as those in their corresponding sig-<lb/>nal categories except for the following requirements. The VBF W Z <lb/>validation region is defined by inverting the requirements on the <lb/>dijet variables: 100 &lt; m jj &lt; 500 GeV and | η jj | &lt; 3.5. The W Z qq <lb/>validation region requires the events to have p Z <lb/>T /m W Z &lt; 0.35 or <lb/>p W <lb/>T /m W Z &lt; 0.35. These validation regions are dominated by the <lb/>W Z contribution, with a purity higher than 80%. For the bench-<lb/>mark models with parameters given in Section 3, the signal con-<lb/>tamination in the q q (VBF) validation region is below 5% (1%). The <lb/>reconstructed m W Z mass in the validation regions is shown in <lb/>Fig. 3, where good agreement of data with the background pre-<lb/>diction is observed. <lb/>Events from Z +jets, Z γ , W γ , t t, single top or W W where jets <lb/>or photons were misidentified as leptons (here called fake/non-<lb/>prompt leptons), can also satisfy the selection criteria. The distri-<lb/>bution shapes and number of fake/non-prompt lepton events are <lb/>estimated for both the q q and VBF categories by a data-driven <lb/>method using a global matrix which exploits differences in ob-<lb/>ject characteristics between real and fake/non-prompt leptons on <lb/>a statistical basis. Details of the method, here referred to as &quot;Ma-<lb/>trix Method&quot;, can be found in Ref. [73]. <lb/>Other backgrounds include t tV , Z Z , t Z , W Zbj and triple boson <lb/>production. They are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (Sec-<lb/>tion 3). The t Z , W Zbj and V V V backgrounds are added as a single <lb/>contribution, here called t Z+V V V . <lb/>7. Systematic uncertainties <lb/>Systematic uncertainties result from the theoretical modelling <lb/>of backgrounds and from object and event reconstruction. <lb/>The uncertainty in the normalization of the Sherpa samples <lb/>of SM W Z background is evaluated by taking into account the <lb/>variations obtained with different PDF sets [74]. The nominal set <lb/>NNPDF30nloas0118 is compared with other samples generated <lb/>with the CT14nnlo and MMHT2014nlo68cl PDF sets and the uncer-<lb/>tainty is evaluated from the maximum differences. It is estimated <lb/>to be below 6% in all mass bins for both the VBF and q q cate-<lb/>gories. The uncertainty associated with the choice of renormaliza-<lb/>tion and factorization scales, μ R and μ F , is taken as the maximum <lb/>downward and upward variation when the scales are varied inde-<lb/>pendently by factors of 1/2 and 2. While these uncertainties can in <lb/>principle affect the shape of the m W Z distribution, in practice the <lb/>shape differences do not have a strong impact on the sensitivity of <lb/>the search. The uncertainties are therefore treated as normalization <lb/>uncertainties, taken to be 20% and 40% respectively. Shape system-<lb/>atic uncertainties associated with showering and hadronization of <lb/>the QCD W Z are evaluated by comparing the Powheg-Box v2 sam-<lb/>ples interfaced with Pythia 8.186 and Herwig. For the electroweak <lb/>W Z process the Sherpa 2.2.2 and Madgraph+Pythia 8 predictions <lb/>are compared. This uncertainty band ranges from 10% to 30% for <lb/>both categories. <lb/>The uncertainties assigned to the cross sections of the other <lb/>background sources consist of a contribution from PDF uncertain-<lb/>ties and from QCD scale uncertainties. They are estimated to be <lb/>10% for Z Z , 13% for tt V , 20% for V V V and 15% for t Z . <lb/>The theoretical uncertainties in the cross section and accep-<lb/>tance of the simulated signal samples are evaluated in a similar <lb/>way to the background. The PDF errors are taken from the NNPDF <lb/>LO PDF error set, and the NNPDF set is also compared with the <lb/>CTEQ6L1 and MSTW2008lo68cl sets. The different predictions from <lb/>these PDF sets are taken as an extra contribution to the overall <lb/>uncertainty. For both the q q and VBF categories, the uncertain-<lb/>ties are typically below 5%. This procedure was followed for each <lb/>mass point and a generator-level event selection was chosen to <lb/>closely mimic the one used in the reconstruction-level analysis. <lb/>Scale and PDF uncertainties are not correlated between signal and <lb/>background. <lb/>An uncertainty due to the reconstruction efficiency, momentum <lb/>scales and resolution of electrons and muons is evaluated by vary-<lb/>ing correction factors applied to the MC samples [63,75] within <lb/>appropriate limits. <lb/>The jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties [66] are <lb/>also taken into account as they affect the shape and normal-<lb/>ization of the background distributions. The uncertainty due to <lb/>b-tagging [76] is also included. <lb/>Missing transverse momentum is calculated using the prese-<lb/>lected leptons, jets and other reconstructed objects. The uncertain-<lb/>ties in the reconstruction of those objects are then used to evaluate <lb/></body>

Those due to the p T scale <lb/>and resolution of the soft term are also considered [71,72]. <lb/>An uncertainty in the prediction of the fake/non-prompt back-<lb/>ground is also taken into account as it affects the shape and nor-<lb/>malization of the background distributions. The total uncertainty <lb/>is about 20% (27%) for the q q (VBF) category. It is slightly larger <lb/>for the VBF category because of the higher statistical uncertainty <lb/>derived from the Matrix Method (Section 6). <lb/>The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.1%. It is de-<lb/>rived, following a methodology similar to the one detailed in <lb/>Ref. [77], from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y <lb/>beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016. <lb/>8. Results <lb/>The W Z invariant mass distribution, m W Z , obtained as the sum <lb/>of all four lepton-flavor permutations, is used as the discriminating <lb/>variable, with bin widths comparable to the expected resolution of <lb/>a narrow resonant signal. A binned likelihood function, constructed <lb/>from the Poisson probability of the sum, in each bin, of the contri-<lb/>butions of the background and of a hypothetical signal of strength <lb/>μ relative to the benchmark model, is used to set limits on the <lb/>presence of a signal. The fit is performed in the signal region for <lb/>the q q and VBF categories separately. The systematic uncertain-<lb/>ties described above (Section 7) enter as nuisance parameters with <lb/>Gaussian or log-normal prior distributions, in convolution with the <lb/>nominal background distribution. <lb/>The effects of systematic uncertainties are studied for hypoth-<lb/>esized signals using the signal-strength parameter μ. The list of <lb/>leading sources of uncertainty in the 95% confidence level (CL) <lb/>upper limit on the μ value is given in Table 1 together with <lb/>their relative importance ( μ/μ). The values are quoted sepa-<lb/>rately for a hypothetical HVT signal of mass m(W ) = 800 GeV in <lb/>the q q category and a GM signal of mass m(H ± <lb/>5 ) = 450 GeV in the <lb/>VBF category. Apart from the statistical uncertainties in the data, <lb/>the uncertainty with the largest impact on the sensitivity of the <lb/>searches is related to the W Z background modelling. <lb/>The numbers of background events are extracted through a <lb/>background-only fit of the data in each category. Background con-<lb/>tributions from prompt leptons, including their shapes, are taken <lb/>from MC simulations. In the case of non-prompt leptons the back-<lb/>ground shapes are taken from the Matrix Method. In the fit, the <lb/>normalisation of all backgrounds are allowed to vary within their <lb/>uncertainties. The post-fit background yields are summarized in <lb/>Table 2 for the q q and VBF categories. The fit constrains the SM <lb/>W Z background estimate to the observed data, which reduces the <lb/>Table 2 <lb/>Expected and observed yields in the q q and VBF signal regions. Yields and uncer-<lb/>tainties are evaluated after a background-only fit to the data in the q q or VBF signal <lb/>regions after applying all selection criteria. The uncertainty in the total background <lb/>estimate is smaller than the sum in quadrature of the individual background con-<lb/>tributions due to anti-correlations between the estimates of different background <lb/>sources. <lb/>q q signal region <lb/>VBF signal region <lb/>W Z <lb/>521 ± 29 <lb/>87 ± 12 <lb/>Fake/non-prompt <lb/>64 ± 13 <lb/>15 ± 4 <lb/>t tV <lb/>29 ± 4 <lb/>4 .9 ± 0.8 <lb/>Z Z <lb/>18.9 ± 2.0 <lb/>4 .4 ± 1.0 <lb/>t Z + V V V <lb/>14.1 ± 2.9 <lb/>8 .1 ± 1.8 <lb/>Total background <lb/>647 ± 25 <lb/>120 ± 11 <lb/>Observed <lb/>650 <lb/>114 <lb/>total background uncertainty, pulling the modelling uncertainties <lb/>by less than one standard deviation from their pre-fit values. None <lb/>of the nuisance parameters are significantly pulled or constrained <lb/>relative to their pre-fit values in the background-only fit. <lb/>Fig. 4 shows the post-fit m W Z distribution for the q q and VBF <lb/>categories. The largest difference between the observed data and <lb/>the SM background prediction is in the VBF category. A local ex-<lb/>cess of events at a resonance mass of around 450 GeV can be <lb/>seen in Fig. 4(b). The local significances for signals of H ± <lb/>5 and <lb/>of a heavy vector W are 2.9 and 3.1 standard deviations, respec-<lb/>tively. The respective global significances calculated using the Look <lb/>Elsewhere method as in Ref. [78] and evaluated up to a mass of <lb/>900 GeV, are 1.6 and 1.9 standard deviations. In the q q category <lb/>the largest difference between the observed data and the SM back-<lb/>ground prediction is located around a mass of 700 GeV with a local <lb/>significance of 1.2 standard deviations. <lb/>Upper limits are set on the product of the production cross <lb/>section of new resonances and their decay branching ratio into <lb/>W Z. Exclusion intervals are derived using the CL s method [79] in <lb/>the asymptotic approximation [80]. For masses higher than 900 <lb/>(700) GeV in q q (VBF) category, the small number of expected <lb/>events makes the asymptotic approximation imprecise and the <lb/>limits are calculated using pseudo-experiments. The limit set on <lb/>the signal strength μ is then translated into a limit on the signal <lb/>cross section times branching ratio, σ × B(W → W Z), using the <lb/>theoretical cross section and branching ratio for the given signal <lb/>model. <lb/>Fig. 5 presents the observed and expected limits on σ × <lb/>B(W → W Z) at 95% CL for the HVT model in the q q cate-<lb/>gory.

The results are used to derive <lb/>Fig. 6.

The results <lb/>show a local excess of events over the Standard Model expectations <lb/>at a resonance mass of around 450 GeV. The local significances <lb/>for signals of H ± <lb/>5 and of a heavy vector W boson are 2.9 and 3.1 <lb/>standard deviations respectively.
