			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Shigella sonnei has caused unusually large outbreaks of shigellosis in <lb/>California in 2014 -2015. Preliminary data indicated the involvement of two <lb/>distinct yet related bacterial populations, one from San Diego and San <lb/>Joaquin (SD/SJ) and one from the San Francisco (SF) Bay area. Whole <lb/>genome sequencing of sixty-eight outbreak and archival isolates of S. sonnei <lb/>was performed to investigate the microbiological factors related to these <lb/>outbreaks. Both SD/SJ and SF populations, as well as almost all of the <lb/>archival S. sonnei isolates belonged to sequence type 152 (ST152). <lb/>Genome-wide SNP analysis clustered the majority of California (CA) isolates <lb/>to an earlier described global Lineage III, which has persisted in CA since <lb/>1986. Isolates in the SD/SJ population had a novel Shiga-toxin (STX)-<lb/>encoding lambdoid bacteriophage, most closely related to that found in an <lb/>Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain responsible for a large outbreak. However, <lb/>the STX genes (stx1a and stx1b) from this novel phage had sequences most <lb/>similar to the phages from S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae. The isolates in the <lb/>SF population yielded evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance acquired via the <lb/>accumulation of point mutations in gyrA and parC genes. Thus, the CA S. <lb/>sonnei lineage continues to evolve by the acquisition of increased virulence <lb/>and antibiotic resistance, and enhanced monitoring is advocated for its early <lb/>detection in future outbreaks. <lb/>IMPORTANCE <lb/>Shigellosis is an acute diarrheal disease causing nearly a half-million <lb/>infections, 6,000 hospitalizations, and 70 deaths every year in the United <lb/>States. Shigella sonnei caused two unusually large outbreaks of shigellosis <lb/>in 2014 -2015 in California. We applied whole genome sequence analyses <lb/>to understand the pathogenic potential of bacteria involved in these <lb/>outbreaks. Our results suggest that a local S. sonnei clone has persisted in <lb/>California since 1986. Recently, a derivative of the original clone acquired <lb/>the ability to produce Shiga-toxin via exchanges of bacteriophages with <lb/>other bacteria. Shiga toxin production is connected with more severe <lb/>disease including bloody diarrhea. A second derivative of the original clone <lb/>recovered from the San Francisco Bay area showed evidence of gradual <lb/>acquisition of antimicrobial resistance. These evolutionary changes in S. <lb/>sonnei populations must be monitored to explore the future risks of spread <lb/>of increasingly virulent and resistant clones. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Shigellosis is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by bacteria <lb/>belonging to the genus Shigella. Shigellosis is the third most common <lb/>enteric bacterial infection in the United States with 500,000 infections, 6,000 <lb/>hospitalizations, and 70 deaths each year [1]. There are four Shigella <lb/>species which cause shigellosis: S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. <lb/>sonnei [2]. S. dysenteriae is considered to be the most virulent species <lb/>especially S. dysenteriae type 1 serotype due to its ability to produce a <lb/>potent cytotoxin called Shiga-toxin. S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei <lb/>generally do not produce Shiga-toxin (STX) and, therefore, cause mild forms <lb/>of shigellosis [2, 3]. Shiga-toxins can also be produced by Shiga toxin-<lb/>producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Two types of STX are known in STEC: <lb/>STX 1 which differs by a single amino acid from STX in S. dysenteriae type <lb/>1, and STX 2 which shares only about 55% amino-acid similarity with STX 1 <lb/>[4]. STX-operons for both type 1 and 2 STX consist of the stxA and stxB <lb/>subunit genes, which encode the AB 5 holotoxin [5]. Rarely, Shiga-toxin <lb/>genes stx can be transferred to non-STX-producing S.flexneri and S. sonnei <lb/>by means of lambdoid bacteriophage either from STEC or S. dysenteriae [3, <lb/>6, 7], providing those strains with the ability to cause more severe disease. <lb/>Infections caused by bacterial species that produce STX often lead to <lb/>hemorrhagic colitis and may cause serious complications, like hemolytic <lb/>uremic syndrome (HUS) [8]. <lb/>S. sonnei has caused two large outbreaks in California (CA) in <lb/>2014−2015. The first outbreak with distinct clusters in the San Diego and <lb/>San Joaquin (SD/SJ) areas was caused by STX-producing isolates [9]. <lb/>Another CA S. sonnei outbreak occurred within the same time frame as the <lb/>two clusters described above, but was caused by a STX-negative S. sonnei <lb/>strain and was confined primarily to the San Francisco Bay (SF) area [10]. <lb/>We performed whole genome sequencing of sixty-eight outbreak and <lb/>archival isolates to gain further insights into the microbiological factors <lb/>associated with these shigellosis outbreaks. We examined the phylogeny of <lb/>local S. sonnei isolates and also performed comparison of CA isolates with <lb/>global S. sonnei clones. The results provided new insight into likely origin of <lb/>current CA S. sonnei isolates and evolutionary changes to acquire more <lb/>virulence and antibiotic resistance. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>In silico MLST and hq SNP Analysis <lb/>Sequences of 7 house-keeping genes were extracted from genomic <lb/>sequences of all isolates and their allele numbers were identified using the <lb/>CGE MLST database [11]. The sequence type (ST) was assigned to each <lb/>isolate based on combination of identified alleles. All outbreak and archival <lb/>CA S. sonnei isolates had identical sequences for 7 MLST loci and were <lb/>assigned to the same sequence type 152 (ST152), with the exception of one <lb/>historical isolate C97 identified as ST1502. ST1502 differs from ST152 by a <lb/>single allele. S. sonnei ST 152 was previously found in Germany in 1997 and <lb/>China in 2009 [12]. In the MLST database, there is also a record of ST152 <lb/>isolated in the United Kingdom in 2012, though it is not clear if this ST was <lb/>assigned to E. coli or Shigella species. <lb/>Based on genome-wide SNP analysis, isolates from CA clustered into <lb/>several clades (Figure 1A). All STX-positive isolates from two recent <lb/>outbreak-related San Diego (SD) and San Joaquin (SJ) epidemiological <lb/>groups clustered together and differed from each other by 0-11 SNPs. The <lb/>member of SD epidemiological group C24 had 0 SNP differences with <lb/>several SJ isolates (C101, C114-C119, C122, C123, C125, C128, C129), <lb/>indicating direct relatedness of the isolates from the SD and SJ <lb/>epidemiological clusters. The only STX-negative isolate C130 from SJ had <lb/>48 SNPs differences from the closest member of STX-positive SD/SJ group. <lb/>Isolates from the contemporary outbreak in San Francisco (SF) formed a <lb/>separate cluster (Figure 1A), and had more SNP differences with the SD/SJ <lb/>cluster (251 SNPs) than with the historical isolate C96 from Contra Costa <lb/>County, isolated in 1990 (219 SNPs). Isolate C42 from Santa Clara County <lb/>(2014) was assigned to the SF outbreak based on PFGE (Table S1), but <lb/>differed by 62 SNPs from the closest SF outbreak member. C42 clustered <lb/>closer to the SF outbreak than to any other contemporary or historical <lb/>isolate, therefore was considered to be a part of the SF population. <lb/>The majority of historical isolates were genetically distinct from recent <lb/>isolates except C84 from Imperial County (2008), which differed by 32 SNPs <lb/>from closest member of SD/SJ STX-positive cluster and by 28 SNPs from <lb/>STX-negative SJ isolate C130. This is surprisingly small number of SNPs, <lb/>when compared with the distance between the SD/SJ cluster and other <lb/></body>

			<body>historical isolates (100-1474 SNPs) or even to the contemporary SF <lb/>outbreak cluster (251 SNPs). <lb/>Global phylogeny of CA S.sonnei <lb/>Genomes of CA S. sonnei were compared with global S. sonnei clones <lb/>reported by Holt et al. (Table S2) [13] by genome-wide SNP analysis, which <lb/>is expected to provide better resolution of lineages than MLST. <lb/>The <lb/>clustering of global strains in our analysis showed the same general patterns <lb/>as in the original publication (Fig. S1). Both modern S. sonnei populations <lb/>and the majority of the historical isolates (1986-2008) clustered with <lb/>Lineage III strains. The European isolate from the UK belonging to the <lb/>Global III Lineage isolated in 2008 (the most recent from the analyzed <lb/>collection by Holt et al.), was the closest global strain to both the SD/SJ and <lb/>the SF S. sonnei populations. Historical isolates C96, C98, and C84 (from <lb/>1990, 2007, and 2008, correspondingly), also clustered together with the <lb/>Global III Lineage. Another clade within Lineage III was formed by an isolate <lb/>from Mexico (1998) and a group of historical CA S. sonnei isolates obtained <lb/>between 1986 and 2002. Three CA isolates from 1980-1987 clustered <lb/>together with Lineage II. A single historical isolate C97, which also had a <lb/>unique MLST pattern ST1502, was grouped with Lineage I strains. No <lb/>Lineage IV isolates were found in CA (Figure 1A, Fig. S1) <lb/>COG and pfam clustering of CA S.sonnei genomes <lb/>Hierarchical clustering based on COG (the Clusters of Orthologous Groups <lb/>of proteins) and pfam (protein domains) profiles was used as an alternative <lb/>method for examining similarity and relatedness of strains. This protein <lb/>family profile clustering was carried out with representative genomes of CA <lb/>S. sonnei isolates (C7, 113, C123 -SD/SJ population; C39-SF population; <lb/>C84, C88, C97-historical isolates) and other publicly available genomes of <lb/>Shigella species and different E. coli serotypes. Two different clustering <lb/>methods were used here -one based on presence/absence and one based <lb/>on abundance (in both cases of COG and pfam groups). The COG-based <lb/>approach showed all CA S. sonnei isolates clustering together with E. coli <lb/>and separate from other S. sonnei isolates, with the exception of S. sonnei <lb/>strain 1DT-1, which also clustered with E.coli (Fig. S2A). CA S. sonnei <lb/>clustered closer with non-O157 serotypes of E. coli, particularly with <lb/>O104:H4 STEC strain (which caused a large outbreak in Germany and other <lb/>European countries in 2011) than with E. coli O157:H7. Similar results were <lb/></body>

			<body>seen in the hierarchical clustering based on Pfam profiles (Fig. S2B). Except <lb/>in the pfam clustering two CA S. sonnei isolates (one of the historical <lb/>isolates and one San Francisco isolate) clustered with other S. sonnei from <lb/>the database, while all other CA isolates clustered with E. coli, as previously. <lb/>To determine whether specific parts of genome were shared between CA <lb/>S.sonnei and E.coli and contributed to CA S. sonnei clustering with E.coli, <lb/>we searched for the genes in the genome of CA S.sonnei which had <lb/>homologs in E. coli O104:H4 strains, but not in other S. sonnei from the <lb/>database. The genes which were found to be shared between E. coli <lb/>O104:H4 and STX-positive CA S.sonnei isolates (representative, C7 and <lb/>C123) belonged to either the STX-bacteriophage characterized here (for <lb/>both C7 and C123), or to a bla TEM-1 -encoding plasmid (in case of C123) <lb/>(Table S3). The CA S.sonnei isolates lacking STX-bacteriophage didn&apos;t have <lb/>any genes which were shared with E.coli O104:H4, but not with other <lb/>S.sonnei. <lb/>We also performed a recombination test on alignment of genome-wide <lb/>hqSNPs using the Recombination Detection Program v. 4 (RDP4) [14]. None <lb/>of the used recombination detection algorithms included in the software <lb/>package detected recombination events between CA S.sonnei and E.coli <lb/>O104:H4. Thus, no other gene exchange events, except for STX-<lb/>bacteriophage transfer, were detected between E.coli O104:H4 and CA <lb/>S.sonnei. <lb/>A phylogenetic tree of genomes was constructed from a concatenation of <lb/>a set of 37 core phylogenetic marker genes using Phylosift (Fig. S3A) [15]. <lb/>In this tree, all S. sonnei including CA isolates grouped together, and <lb/>separate from E. coli with one exception. The exception was S. sonnei strain <lb/>1DT-1, which grouped in a clade with E. coli. Both nucleotide (Fig. S3A) and <lb/>amino acid (AA) sequence (data not shown) trees generated with Phylosift <lb/>showed the same result. Whole genome clustering based on genome-wide <lb/>SNPs in both coding and non-coding areas of the genome (Fig. S3B) <lb/>supported the results of Phylosift: all S. sonnei isolates, including ones from <lb/>CA, clustered together, except for S. sonnei 1DT-1. <lb/>The difference between protein family profile clustering and concatenated <lb/>marker gene phylogeny is striking. In the protein family profile clustering CA <lb/>S.sonnei isolates group with E.coli O104:H4 than with other S.sonnei but in <lb/>the concatenated marker gene phylogeny CA S.sonnei and E.coli do not <lb/></body>

			<body>group together. At first, to explain this contrast we considered two plausible <lb/>biological explanations:1) convergent gene gain or loss could have led to <lb/>high similarity in terms of protein family profiles between CA S. sonnei and <lb/>E. coli even though they are not closely related, or 2) considering the <lb/>hypothesis of origination of all Shigella species from E.coli [16], CA S.sonnei <lb/>could be shearing higher similarity of protein family profiles with E.coli <lb/>because it represents a more archaic lineage of S.sonnei species, which <lb/>haven&apos;t diverged from E.coli as much as the other Shigella strains found in <lb/>the NCBI and IMG databases did. <lb/>However, neither of these explained all the results from these analyses. <lb/>Closer examination of some of the results led us to consider a third <lb/>possibility -the observed contrast was an artifact of analysis. Upon further <lb/>review, we found that CA isolates and S. sonnei strain 1DT-1 similar to E. <lb/>coli O104:H4 had low gene count for several Transposases (COG2963, <lb/>COG2801, COG3547, COG3335, COG4584, COG3385) and a DNA replication <lb/>protein DnaC (COG1484), while other Shigella spp. isolates in the database <lb/>had those genes in abundance (Fig. S4). This indicated that a few <lb/>transposable elements skewed the clustering of CA S. sonnei towards E .coli. <lb/>When only the presence/absence of the COG and pfam elements was taken <lb/>into the account, COG-and pfam-based clustering appeared to be congruent <lb/>with nucleotide phylogeny: CA S. sonnei have clustered with other S. sonnei <lb/>strains in the database (Figure 2; Fig. S5). Therefore, we would like to <lb/>emphasize that genome clustering based on gene presence/absence as well <lb/>as abundance is prone to the issues described above and shouldn&apos;t be used <lb/>to infer phylogenies. <lb/>STX-encoding bacteriophage from CA S.sonnei <lb/>All isolates from SD/SJ outbreak possessed STX-1 subunits A and B genes <lb/>(stx1A, stx1B) (Figure 3). None of the historical isolates or recent isolates <lb/>related to the San Francisco outbreak had stx genes. The STX in the SD/SJ <lb/>population was encoded by a novel lambdoid bacteriophage. This 62.8kb <lb/>bacteriophage had identical sequence and was integrated into a <lb/>chromosomal wrbA site in all STX-positive isolates. A modern STX-negative <lb/>S. sonnei isolate C130 from SJ had an intact wrbA site; therefore, we <lb/>conclude that it represents an ancestral STX-negative lineage for the SD/SJ <lb/>population. <lb/>In order to better understand the history of the novel STX-phage in the <lb/>SD/SJ S.sonnei population, we carried out a series of comparative analyses. <lb/></body>

			<body>First, the Phage Search Tool (PHAST) revealed that the best match for the <lb/>novel CA STX1-phage was the STX2-encoding P13374 phage found in <lb/>O104:H4 STEC, an outbreak strain that caused a large outbreak in Germany <lb/>and other European countries in 2011 [17]. This finding was supported by <lb/>Blast searcher which revealed that the bacteriophage from the CA isolates <lb/>was very similar to two phages found in strains from the European E. coli <lb/>O104:H4 outbreak [P13374 phage (NC_018846)] with 97% identity for 88% <lb/>of the query search coverage and the phage in E. coli strain 2011C-3493 <lb/>(CP003289.1) with 97% identity for 93% of the query coverage. CA STX1-<lb/>phage also showed very high similarity with stx2-encoding phages from E. <lb/>coli O104:H4 strains 2009EL-2050 (CP003297.1) and 2009EL-2071 <lb/>(CP003301.1) from Georgia, 2009 [17] with 98% shared identity at 92% <lb/>query length. A recently characterized STX1-encoding S. sonnei phage <lb/>75/02_Stx from Hungary (KF766125.2) was also shown to share large co-<lb/>linear regions with STX2-prophages from E.coli O104:H4 and O157:H7 [5]. <lb/>However, the Hungarian phage only partially resembled CA STX1-phage with <lb/>99% of shared identity at 62% query coverage. <lb/>In order to better understand the phylogenetic relatedness of CA STX1-<lb/>phage to other phages, we generated phylogenetic trees of integrase genes. <lb/>This revealed that the CA STX1-phage grouped evolutionarily with other <lb/>STX-encoding E.coli phages, particularly with phages from E. coli O104:H4, <lb/>but not with ones from Shigella species (Fig. S6). Figure S6 shows the <lb/>phylogeny based on Integrase amino-acid sequences; similar results were <lb/>seen with nucleotide based trees (not shown). This integrase phylogenetic <lb/>analysis confirmed the relatedness of the CA STX-phage to the phage found <lb/>in pandemic E. coli O104:H4 from Germany, 2011. It also showed that <lb/>bacteriophages with integrase genes related to phage from European <lb/>outbreak E. coli O104:H4 were also found earlier in Europe (Norway, 2007 <lb/>and Georgia, 2009). <lb/>We also used progressive Mauve to make and analyze whole phage <lb/>alignments. This revealed that the STX1-phage in CA isolates more closely <lb/>resembled STX-coding phages in E. coli than phages in S. sonnei or S. <lb/>flexneri (Figure 4A, 4B). The stx2-encoding phage from E. coli O104:H4 <lb/>strain 2011C-3493 was the closest to CA STX-phage according to Neighbor-<lb/>Joining tree built based on the estimate of the shared gene content from <lb/>progressiveMauve alignment. Notably, E. coli strain 2011C-3493 was <lb/></body>

			<body>isolated in the US from a patient with the history of travel to Germany and <lb/>shown to be a part of German outbreak [18]. <lb/>Examination of the distribution of CA STX1-bacteriophage-related genes <lb/>in different E. coli and Shigella serovars in the IMG database showed that <lb/>the CA STX-phage genes were also present in E. coli O104:H4 isolates, the <lb/>majority of which were directly related to the German outbreak. Strain <lb/>ON2010 of E. coli O104:H4 from Canada (2010), which was not linked to the <lb/>German outbreak [19], showed no presence of CA STX-phage genes (Fig. <lb/>S7). <lb/>In several CA isolates we identified the bacteriophages known to be <lb/>associated with STX, but which were missing actual stx genes. According to <lb/>PHAST output, the isolate C7 possessed an intact STX2-converting phage <lb/>1717 (NC_011357), isolate C113 had an incomplete STX2-converting phage <lb/>86 (NC_008464), and isolates C16 harbored a questionable STX2-<lb/>converting phage I (NC_003525), while none of them contained the stx <lb/>gene sequence (Fig. S8). We propose that the stx genes have been gained <lb/>and lost during the evolution of S.sonnei in California. <lb/>STX-holotoxin and other virulence determinants CA S.sonnei <lb/>Even though the phage from German outbreak STEC strain was identified <lb/>as the most closely related to the CA STX1-phage, it carries the stx2 gene, <lb/>while CA phage encodes the STX1 toxin. The STX-operon in CA isolates <lb/>(holotoxin genes stx1a and stx1b) was identical to STX operons in S. <lb/>flexneri phage POCJ13 (KJ603229.1) and several S. dysenteriae strains, <lb/>including S. dysenteriae type 1 (M19437.1), but differed from STX operon in <lb/>the majority of E. coli strains. The CA S. sonnei STX-operon had 1 SNP <lb/>difference with other STX1-encoding S. sonnei bacteriophages (Accession <lb/>## KF766125.2 and AJ132761.1). Similarity of different regions of CA <lb/>STX1-phage to various phages can be explained by the mosaic structure of <lb/>STX lambdoid phages due to frequent recombinations and modular <lb/>exchange with other lambdoid phages [20]. Moreover, there is evidence <lb/>that it could be quite common for lambdoid phages of S. sonnei to have an <lb/>STX genes from S. dysenteriae and the rest of the phage genes resembling <lb/>STEC or EHEC E. coli strains [3, 5]. <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>Besides STX, the following virulence genes were detected in S. sonnei <lb/>from CA: Shigella IgA-like protease homologue (sigA), glutamate <lb/>decarboxylase (gad), plasmid-encoded enterotoxin (senB), P-related <lb/>fimbriae regulatory gene (prfB), long polar fimbriae (lpfA), endonuclease <lb/>colicin E2 (celb), invasion protein S. flexneri (ipaD), VirF transcriptional <lb/>activator (virF), and increased serum survival gene (iss). The distribution of <lb/>these virulence genes in different S.sonnei populations from CA is presented <lb/>in Figure 3. The increased serum survival virulence gene iss was mainly <lb/>found in more recent of the SD/SJ population of isolates, and in a single <lb/>historical isolate from 1980, however the iss alleles in modern and historical <lb/>isolates were different. <lb/>Antimicrobial resistance of CA S.sonnei <lb/>Acquired antibiotic resistance (ABR) markers to the following classes of <lb/>antimicrobials were identified: beta-lactams (genes bla TEM-1 ; bla OXA-2 ), <lb/>aminoglycosides (aph(3&apos;&apos;)-Ib; aph(6)-Id; aac(3)-IId; aadA1; aadA2), <lb/>macrolides (mphA), sulphonamides (sul1; sul2), phenicols (catA1), <lb/>trimethoprim (dfrA1; dfrA8; dfrA12), and tetracycline (tetA; tetB) (Figure 5). <lb/>The majority of the isolates possessed genes predicted to provide resistance <lb/>to aminoglycosides, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, and tetracycline. In <lb/>addition, a phenotypic resistance to penicillins mediated by TEM-1 β-<lb/>lactamase gene occurred in 16 isolates. The correlation between the <lb/>genotype and susceptibility phenotype is presented in the Table S4. In 100% <lb/>of cases, the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants correlated with <lb/>the expected non-susceptible phenotype. The 92.9% of the isolates lacking <lb/>the resistance determinant were susceptible to corresponding antimicrobials. <lb/>A variant of the gene of aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme aac(3)-IId was <lb/>found in a single S. sonnei isolate C98 from CA; the aac(3)-IId-like gene in <lb/>isolate C98 shared 99.8% identity with previously described variant of this <lb/>gene.Acetyltransferase aac(3)-IId was shown previously to confer resistance <lb/>to gentamicin and tobramycin in E. coli isolates [21], while a S. sonnei <lb/>isolate harboring a variant of this gene was intermediate to tobramycin and <lb/>resistant to gentamicin. <lb/>In 7% of cases, the isolates without known antibiotic-resistance genes <lb/>appeared to be non-susceptible (Table S4), suggesting the presence of <lb/>resistance mechanisms, like loss of porins and increased efflux [22], which <lb/>are not included in the ResFinder database. For example, two isolates <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>showed intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin, and 15 isolates were <lb/>non-susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam in the absence of the genes which <lb/>would explain the corresponding resistance phenotypes in those isolates. <lb/>Among the tetracycline-resistant isolates, 3.3% (n=2) of isolates did not <lb/>possess any known tetracycline resistance genes, while 86.9% (n=53) had a <lb/>truncated version of tet(A) gene (1172 bp vs. 1200 bp for the full-length <lb/>reference sequence from the ResFinder database). Nonetheless, the isolates <lb/>without tetracycline-resistance genes or with incomplete tet(A) gene <lb/>demonstrated a high level resistance to tetracycline (MIC &gt;8µg/mL). This <lb/>suggests the presence of additional mechanisms of resistance, undetectable <lb/>by the ResFinder database. <lb/>Acquired ABR genes were frequently associated with various mobile <lb/>elements. Penicillin resistance encoded by bla TEM-1 gene was associated with <lb/>Tn3 transposon located on conjugative plasmids of IncB/O/K/Z <lb/>incompatibility group found in both recent SF and historical isolates (Fig. <lb/>S9A) or on the putative IncI1 plasmid in several modern SJ isolates (Fig. <lb/>S9B). Partial plasmid sequences were identified in historical isolates as <lb/>IncB/O/K/Z and contained plasmid backbone genes encoding following <lb/>products: transcriptional activator RfaH, plasmid stabilization system <lb/>protein, ribbon-helix-helix protein CopG, replication initiation protein RepA, <lb/>and plasmid conjugative transfer protein. This partial IncB/O/K/Z plasmid <lb/>sequences in historical isolates matched analogous area in IncB/O/K/Z <lb/>plasmids of recent isolates, suggesting their relatedness to each other. A <lb/>determinant Tn3::bla TEM-1 was integrated into different loci of the <lb/>IncB/O/K/Z plasmids in historical isolates in comparison with integration <lb/>locus in IncB/O/K/Z plasmids of modern San Francisco cluster isolates, which <lb/>suggests that dissemination of the bla TEM-1 gene is associated with the <lb/>transfer via Tn3 (Fig. S9A). <lb/>Aminoglycoside and trimethoprim resistance genes were often linked with <lb/>Tn7 transposon (Fig. S9C). A genetic region, containing an association of <lb/>Tn7 with aadA1 and dfrA1 ABR genes, as well as TDP-fucosamine <lb/>acetyltransferase, and a partial sequence of Tyrosine recombinase XerC/D, <lb/>was identical in recent SJ isolates and two historical samples C99 and C92, <lb/>isolated in Shasta County, 2000 and Imperial County, 2002, correspondingly. <lb/>However, the area upstream of Tn7 in novel isolates showed evidence of <lb/>later integration of additional Tn7 element, leading to the loss or <lb/></body>

			<body>modification of the area containing tetracycline resistance genes found in <lb/>historical isolates. <lb/>One of the historical isolates C80 (Orange County, 1987) was resistant to <lb/>azithromycin and possessed macrolide resistance gene mphA, found in <lb/>association with Tn7 transposon on a contig which also encoded <lb/>trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycoside resistance, multidrug <lb/>transporter EmrE, and a Mercuric resistance operon (Figure 6). Resistance to <lb/>azithromycin is emerging in the United States [23], and the presence of <lb/>azithromycin resistance gene in one of the isolates dating back to 1987 is <lb/>remarkable. <lb/>Fluoroquinolone resistance <lb/>All modern isolates from the SD/SJ population and historical S. sonnei <lb/>isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (FQ), however few historical <lb/>isolates possessed several types of point mutations leading to AA <lb/>substitutions in the genes encoding FQ targets-the A subunit of DNA-gyrase <lb/>(GyrA) and the C subunit of topoisomerase IV (ParC) (Figure 5, Table S4) <lb/>The quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) [24] of the GyrA in two <lb/>CA historical isolates had a single amino acid substitution S83L. S.sonnei <lb/>isolates with single mutation S83L have been previously reported to exhibit <lb/>high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of quinolones (nalidixic acid), <lb/>but low MIC of fluoroquinolones (MIC range of ciprofloxacin 0.125-<lb/>0.25µg/ml) [25]. In agreement with previous data, historical CA S.sonnei <lb/>isolates with single mutation S83L remained phenotypically susceptible to <lb/>ciprofloxacin with wild-type MIC values of ≤0.5 µg/mL. Two FQ-susceptible <lb/>historical isolates had single point mutation V533A in the ParC, and one FQ-<lb/>susceptible isolate had combination of ParC-V533A and GyrA-D483E <lb/>mutations; none of the mutations were located in QRDR regions of <lb/>corresponding proteins and were not associated with a resistant phenotype. <lb/>In contrast, all SF population isolates implicated in the outbreak <lb/>expressed high level FQ-resistance. All isolates from the contemporary San <lb/>Francisco outbreak had a combination of point mutations S83L and D87G in <lb/>QRDR GyrA and substitution S80I in QRDR ParC, which caused a significant <lb/>increase in ciprofloxacin MIC to ≥4 µg/mL (Table S4). The modern non-<lb/>outbreak isolate C42, belonging to the SF population, was phenotypically <lb/>susceptible to FQ and possessed a single QRDR GyrA mutation S83L, which <lb/>represents a prerequisite mutation allowing for one-step development of <lb/></body>

			<body>high-level FQ resistance if combined with another QRDR mutation [26], thus <lb/>suggesting a concurrent accumulation of FQ resistance mutations in the SF <lb/>population of S. sonnei (Figure 5). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>From our point of view, the key results of our study were: 1) the first <lb/>large scale whole genome sequencing and analysis of S. sonnei strains from <lb/>North America, 2) the delineation of two distinct yet related populations of S. <lb/>sonnei that caused large outbreaks of shigellosis in California [SD and SJ <lb/>population and SF population], 3) linkage of SD/SJ and SF populations to an <lb/>older lineage of S. sonnei documented in California as early as 1986. This <lb/>historical CA lineage was characterized as sequence type 152 and belonged <lb/>to a global Lineage III with origin in Europe, 4) evidence of stx1-encoding <lb/>bacteriophage in the SD/SJ population. The phage was related to the phage <lb/>from pandemic E. coli O104:H4 with the STX-operon identical to those in S. <lb/>flexneri and S. dysenteriae, 5) evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance in SF <lb/>population via accumulation of mutations in the genes of antibiotic targets-<lb/>GyrA and ParC. <lb/>According to the whole-genome hqSNP phylogeny, the isolates from <lb/>outbreaks of 2014 -2015 were divided into two distinct SD/SJ and SF <lb/>populations. The isolates from SD and SJ epidemiological groups were <lb/>assigned to two separate clusters according to PFGE profiling [9], however <lb/>based on WGS we showed that SD and SJ clusters were a part of the same <lb/>SD/SJ outbreak population. <lb/>Many recent publications have highlighted <lb/>superior discriminatory power and predictive value of WGS over PFGE for <lb/>genotyping of bacterial strains [27]. <lb/>Comparison to global S. sonnei clones placed both modern SD/SJ and <lb/>SF populations as well as majority of historical CA S. sonnei isolates dating <lb/>back as far as 1986 into the Lineage III defined by Holt et al. [13] (Figure <lb/>1A, Fig. S1). All STX-positive SD/SJ isolates clustered with Global III clade <lb/>defined by Holt et al. within Lineage III, which was shown to be particularly <lb/>successful at global expansion [13]. Remarkably, the isolates from SD/SJ <lb/>population, as well as from SF population, were closest to the isolate from <lb/>the UK, 2008, while they did not cluster with geographically proximate <lb/>isolate from Mexico, which was only related to few historical CA isolates. <lb/>Accepting the hypothesis that all original S. sonnei lineages diversified from <lb/>Europe and then were introduced to other countries where they underwent <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>localized clonal expansions [13], our findings suggest that while strain <lb/>exchange with Mexico had happened in the past, the lineage ancestral to the <lb/>current SD/SJ and SF S. sonnei populations was introduced at some point <lb/>from Europe, and diversified within CA. The data suggests that the <lb/>acquisition of stx1 gene happened after the original Lineage III S. sonnei <lb/>clone had already spread in CA. The contemporary C130 and historical C84 <lb/>STX-negative S. sonnei isolates, which both clustered with STX-positive <lb/>SD/SJ outbreak isolates, most likely represent an ancestral STX-negative <lb/>lineage for the SD/SJ population, prior to STX-bacteriophage acquisition. It <lb/>appears that global S. sonnei clones belonging to Lineages I, II, and III were <lb/>introduced to CA independently during the last three decades. <lb/>All recent S. sonnei outbreak isolates as well as all but one historical <lb/>isolates belonged to a sequence type ST152. This long-term persistence of a <lb/>single clone in CA over three decades is remarkable, and could indicate that <lb/>ST152 is a very successful S. sonnei clone. There were previous examples <lb/>when the same sequence types persisted in the same geographical area for <lb/>a long time, e.g. ST245 in China was found in 1983 as well as 26 years later <lb/>in 2009 [12]. This phenomenon, however, is most likely explained by a low <lb/>resolution of MLST for subtyping of clonal S. sonnei population, which has <lb/>been noted before [28]. <lb/>Isolates from the SD/SJ S. sonnei population, which caused outbreak <lb/>of severe diarrheal disease [9], carried stx1 genes encoded by a novel <lb/>lambdoid bacteriophage in all of the isolates. The STX-bacteriophage from E. <lb/>coli O104:H4 strain implicated in an European outbreak of 2011 was found <lb/>to be the closest known relative to STX-phage of SD/SJ S. sonnei isolates <lb/>based on overall similarity of the whole-phage sequences. This outbreak was <lb/>one of the world&apos;s largest outbreaks of food-borne disease in humans with <lb/>855 HUS and 53 fatalities [29, 30]. Considering the particular proximity of <lb/>CA STX-phage to the phage from E. coli O104:H4 strain 2011C-3493 <lb/>introduced from Germany to the US in 2011, we speculate that introduction <lb/>of STX-phage into the SD/SJ S. sonnei population happened after the <lb/>outbreak E. coli O104:H4 was brought to the US, followed by a local <lb/>diversification of STX-phage, which involved recombination of STX-operon to <lb/>yield the final phage with general architecture of E. coli phage and STX-<lb/>operon from S. flexneri or S. dysenteriae. However, it is also possible that <lb/>STX-phage from pandemic E. coli O104:H4 underwent the modifications via <lb/>recombination with other European phages, prior to its introduction to CA S. <lb/></body>

			<body>sonnei clone. The transfer of STX-bacteriophage is the only gene exchange <lb/>event we detected between E. coli O104:H4 and S. sonnei genomes. It <lb/>would be pertinent to emphasize that the German outbreak strains of E. coli <lb/>also contained distinct STX operon with stx2 gene, several virulence and <lb/>antibiotic-resistance elements [31]. <lb/>It has been demonstrated previously that phage phylogeny should be <lb/>inferred from a combination of protein repertoires and phage architecture <lb/>rather than from a single gene (e.g. integrase) sequence [32, 33]. The <lb/>mosaic structure of the lambdoid phages poses a limitation for such single <lb/>locus-phylogeny approach. Thus, even though the integrase phylogeny <lb/>showed that CA isolate has an integrase gene more closely related to older <lb/>Georgian than with recent German E. coli O104:H4 isolate, this does not <lb/>contradict the relatedness of CA phage to the outbreak lamboid-phage <lb/>shown based on the cumulative data derived from the whole phage <lb/>sequence. This also could be explained by a long-term persistence of phages <lb/>belonging to a given Integrase family in Europe. <lb/>STX-1 encoding bacteriophage was not found in the isolate C130 even <lb/>though it was closely related to SD/SJ S. sonnei population. It is possible <lb/>that the bacterial population as a whole acquired STX1-encoding <lb/>bacteriophage more recently, and concurrently. Such a scenario would also <lb/>suggest that the increase in the virulence took place either by the spread of <lb/>STX-positive clones or by the horizontal transfer of stx1-genes by <lb/>bacteriophages. The potential of bacteriophages to transfer STX genes from <lb/>one S. sonnei strain to another has been described previously [3]. Not all <lb/>the S. sonnei strains have a suitable genetic background to be able to <lb/>express STX efficiently [34]. The modern STX-positive SD/SJ population of <lb/>S.sonnei was shown to be able to express STX and thus is proven to possess <lb/>the genetic background which is adapted for the increased virulence. The <lb/>adaptation of SD/SJ S. sonnei genomic background to retain and express <lb/>STX stably by itself is a prerequisite for future emergence of more virulent <lb/>strains in CA. Another example of SD/SJ population increasing its virulence <lb/>is an acquisition of increased serum survival virulence gene iss, which <lb/>occurred seemingly recently in evolution of SD/SJ S.sonnei clone. To our <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>knowledge, this is the first report of increased serum survival determinant <lb/>(iss) being found in Shigella species. <lb/>Even though the treatment of infection caused by S. sonnei with antibiotics <lb/>is not a standard procedure, it is indicated for the treatment of severe cases <lb/>in order to reduce duration of symptoms [35]. Antibiotic resistance of S. <lb/>sonnei is however on the rise [10, 36, 37]. This highlights the importance of <lb/>ABR monitoring in S. sonnei populations. We detected resistance markers to <lb/>multiple classes of antimicrobials in CA S. sonnei. 91.2% of modern isolates <lb/>and 81.8% of historical isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR) according <lb/>to the definition of MDR microorganisms as demonstrating &quot;non-<lb/>susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories&quot; <lb/>[38]. Acquired ABR genes in CA S. sonnei were frequently associated with <lb/>various mobile elements and conjugative plasmids, likely contributing to <lb/>their dissemination. For example, MDR transposon Tn7 has been shown to <lb/>be a crucial part of ABR evolution in the local populations of S. sonnei <lb/>Lineage III [13]. Once acquired, ABR genes tend to stay in the bacterial <lb/>population, e.g. traditional antibiotics like cotrimoxazole and tetracycline are <lb/>no longer in use for patient treatment [12], but the ABR genes still persist in <lb/>the modern SD/SJ and SF populations of the CA S. sonnei. Particularly <lb/>worrisome was the fluoroquinolone resistance detected in all of the isolates <lb/>belonging to a modern SF S.sonnei population, implicated in the outbreak. <lb/>FQ-resistance in all SF outbreak isolates was mediated by a combination of <lb/>double mutation in QRDR GyrA of DNA gyrase and one mutation in QRDR <lb/>ParC of topoisomerase IV. All historical isolates as well all other modern <lb/>isolates were susceptible to FQ, however few of those phenotypically <lb/>susceptible CA S.sonnei isolates possessed a prerequisite single AA <lb/>substitution in QRDR of the GyrA, including two isolate belonging to CA <lb/>Lineage III: one historical isolate from 2007 and one modern non-outbreak <lb/>isolate belonging to SF population. Single mutations in QRDR GyrA were <lb/>shown previously to confer a low level of FQ resistance and to serve a <lb/>prerequisite for further resistance escalation via stepwise mutations <lb/>acquisition [26]. Therefore, the data suggests that evolution of SF <lb/>population from ancestral S. sonnei lineage is occurring via increase in <lb/>fluoroquinolone resistance mediated by the accumulation of FQ-resistance <lb/>mutations. <lb/></body>

			<body>There are certain limitations of this study: 1) temporal and spatial <lb/>representation was sporadic in S. sonnei strains in our culture collection, 2) <lb/>the short read sequencing by synthesis used to generate data might limit <lb/>complete assembly of S. sonnei genomes and enumeration of genome-wide <lb/>SNPs, 3) no plasmid transformation followed by re-sequencing could be <lb/>performed to confirm postulated genetic exchanges among S. sonnei <lb/>populations. Although the direct experimental evidence is lacking, Shiga-<lb/>toxin production and other virulence elements discovered in SD/SJ <lb/>population appeared to be among the contributors that lead to serious <lb/>manifestations of gastrointestinal disease in CA shigellosis outbreak <lb/>including bloody diarrhea in 71% of patients [9]. Fortunately, there were no <lb/>fatalities and none of the affected patients developed more serious hemolytic <lb/>uremic syndrome (HUS). One potential clue to the absence of severe <lb/>manifestations could be that Shiga-toxin positive S. sonnei strains contained <lb/>Stx1. The toxins encoded by Stx1 and Stx2 are known to elicit variable <lb/>pathology among affected individuals. A number of investigators have <lb/>demonstrated that E. coli O157 Shiga-toxin producing strains carrying Stx2 <lb/>caused more severe disease including HUS than Stx1 positive strains [39-<lb/>41]. <lb/>Conclusion: Two distinct populations of S. sonnei (SD/SJ and SF) have been <lb/>delineated in the recent shigellosis outbreaks in California. These populations <lb/>evolved from a common lineage of S. sonnei likely present in California as <lb/>early as 1986. The suggested evolutionary pathways were: 1) increased <lb/>virulence via acquisition of a phage from the E. coli O104:H4 German <lb/>outbreak strain and STX-operon from S. flexneri or S. dysenteriae, and 2) <lb/>emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance via the accumulations of point <lb/>mutations in gyrA and parC genes. The modern CA S. sonnei populations <lb/>were related to the global Lineage III, which originated in Europe and was <lb/>known for its successful expansion around the world. Thus, the CA S. sonnei <lb/>lineage continues to evolve by the acquisition of increased virulence and <lb/>antibiotic resistance, and enhanced surveillance is advocated for its early <lb/>detection in future shigellosis outbreaks. <lb/></body>

			<body>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Isolates <lb/>Sixty-eight S.sonnei human isolates from CA (57 outbreak-related from <lb/>2014-2015 and 11 archival isolates from 1980-2008), were identified and <lb/>serotyped by standard methods [42]. PCR-detection of stx 1 and stx 2 genes, <lb/>and Vero cell neutralization assay for confirmation of STX-production were <lb/>performed as previously described [43]. A list of isolates is presented in the <lb/>Table S1. A map with geographical distribution of the location of origin of the <lb/>isolates is in Figure 1B. <lb/>WGS and data analysis <lb/>DNA was extracted with a Wizard Genomic DNA Kits (Promega, Madison, <lb/>WI). Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT (Illumina <lb/>Inc., San Diego, CA) library preparation kits. Sequencing was performed <lb/>using 2 x 300 bp sequencing chemistry on an Illumina MiSeq Sequencer as <lb/>per manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>For genome-wide SNP identification, paired-end reads were mapped to <lb/>the reference genome of S. sonnei Ss046 (NC_007384.1) with masking of <lb/>the mobile and phage elements and phylogenetic tree was built using CLCbio <lb/>Genomic Workbench 8.0.2 (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark). A phylogenetic tree <lb/>was generated using maximum likelihood phylogeny (under the Jukes-<lb/>Cantor nucleotide substitution model; with bootstrapping) based on high-<lb/>quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (hqSNPs). SNPs were called in <lb/>coding and non-coding genome areas using SAMtools mpileup (v.1.2; [44]) <lb/>and <lb/>converted <lb/>into <lb/>VCF <lb/>matrix <lb/>using <lb/>bcftools <lb/>(v0.1.19; <lb/>http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/). Variants were parsed using vcftools <lb/>(v.0.1.12b; [45]) to include only high-quality SNPs (hqSNPs) with coverage <lb/>≥5x, minimum quality &gt; 200, minimum genotype quality (GQ) 10 (--minDP <lb/>5; --minQ 200; --minGQ 10; --remove-indels), with InDels and the <lb/>heterozygote calls excluded. <lb/>Phylosift [15] was used to (1) identify 37 &quot;universal&quot; genes in a set of <lb/>genomes (including those generated here) (2) generate alignments for each <lb/>gene family and then concatenate the alignments. A phylogenetic tree was <lb/>inferred from the concatenated alignments using RAxML 7.2.6. bipartition <lb/>trees were generated using 1000 bootstraps. COG-and Pfam-based <lb/>identification and clustering was done using the DOE Joint Genome Institute <lb/>(JGI) <lb/>Integrated <lb/>Microbial <lb/>Genomes (IMG) <lb/>system <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>(https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/mer). The presence or absence matrices <lb/>were fed to RAxML 7.3.0 [46] to produce a best tree from 50 boostraps <lb/>using the gamma model rate of heterogeneity for binary input. COG <lb/>abundance profile and gene homologs search was performed using JGI IMG <lb/>tools. <lb/>De novo assembly for each genome was done on CLCbio GW8.0.2. The <lb/>assembled genomes of S. sonnei isolates had 30-159 x sequencing <lb/>coverage. Genomes were annotated with prokka v1.1, the JGI IMG <lb/>database, the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) (ResFinder, <lb/>VirulenceFinder, PlasmidFinder) [47], and the Phage Search Tool (PHAST) <lb/>[48] online resources. In silico multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was <lb/>performed using the CGE online tool [11] against the MLST database <lb/>E.coli#1 [49]. To estimate similarity between the bacteriophages, sequence <lb/>alignment and a neighbor-joining tree (based on the estimate of the shared <lb/>gene content) were generated using the progressiveMauve program [50]. <lb/>Additionally, sequences of integrases (both the DNA for the genes and the <lb/>encoded amino acids for the proteins), derived from the sequences of STX-<lb/>phage belonging to Shigella spp. and E.coli strains, were aligned using <lb/>CLCbio GW8.0.2. general aligner and a neighbor-joining tree was generated <lb/>as above. <lb/>Recombination test was performed on genome-wide hqSNP alignment <lb/>using Recombination Detection Program v. 4.67 (RDP4) [14]. The following <lb/>algorithms included into the RDP4 package were applied to search for the <lb/>recombination events: RDP, BOOTSCAN, GENECONV, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, <lb/>SISCAN, 3SEQ, PHYLPRO, and VisRD. A window size of 100 and a step size <lb/>of 30 were used. <lb/>Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance testing <lb/>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. sonnei isolates was performed <lb/>using Microscan Dried Gram Negative panels Neg MIC 38 (Beckman Coulter, <lb/>Brea, CA, USA); the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results were <lb/>read and interpreted according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>Streptomycin (10 µg) and azithromycin (15 µg) BBL Sensi-Discs (Becton <lb/>Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were used to determine susceptibility to <lb/>the corresponding antimicrobials. Standard quality control strains were <lb/>tested in parallel as required in respective product inserts. <lb/>SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS <lb/></body>
