Specifically, <lb/>in monolayer semiconductors, a strong excitonic resonance leads to a sharp oscillation in <lb/>permittivity; at energies close to an exciton, the real part of the permittivity can reach high <lb/>positive values or even become negative. This extreme optical response enables surface exciton-<lb/>polaritons to guide visible light bound to an atomically thin layer. However, such ultrathin <lb/>waveguides support a transverse electric (TE) mode with low confinement and a transverse <lb/>magnetic (TM) mode with short propagation. Here, we propose that realistic semiconductor-<lb/>insulator-semiconductor superlattices consisting of monolayer WS 2 and hexagonal boron nitride <lb/>(hBN) can improve the properties of both TE and TM modes. Compared to a single monolayer, <lb/>a heterostructure with a 1-nm hBN spacer improves the confinement of the TE mode from 1.2 to <lb/>around 0.5 μm, whereas the out-of-plane extension of the TM mode increases from 25 to 50 nm. <lb/>We propose two simple additivity rules for mode confinement valid in the ultrathin film <lb/>approximation for heterostructures with increasing spacer thickness. Stacking additional WS 2 <lb/>monolayers into superlattices further enhances the waveguiding properties.

        <body>Surface polaritons are electromagnetic surface waves that allow enhanced light-matter interaction at the <lb/>nanoscale. They offer new opportunities for devices such as modulators, sensors, sources, and <lb/>photodetectors. These waves propagate along the interface between two materials and decay in the <lb/>perpendicular (out-of-plane) direction. Such polaritons can be sustained by different types of <lb/>quasiparticles in matter, like plasmons, phonons, and excitons. 1 Noble metals are common materials <lb/>for supporting surface plasmon-polaritons and guiding light below the diffraction limit. 2,3 However, <lb/>active tunability remains elusive because it is difficult to substantially alter the high density of free <lb/>electrons in a metal. <lb/>Compared to plasmon-polaritons, surface exciton-polaritons (SEPs) are excitons that concomitantly <lb/>oscillate with photons, producing a propagating surface wave bound to the interface. Exciton-polaritons <lb/>have been experimentally observed in different organic 4,5 and inorganic crystals 6,7 with large absorption <lb/>coefficients. For example, molecular J-aggregates of organic dyes 8,9 can sustain SEPs at room <lb/>temperature and create opportunities to realize novel sensors. 10 However, SEPs in those materials still <lb/>have tunability limitations. As an alternative, atomically thin materials possess extreme optical <lb/>properties that can be modulated while potentially giving access to the spin and valley degrees of <lb/>freedom. 11,12 Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride can indeed support plasmon-and phonon-<lb/>polaritons. 1,13 These polaritons occur, however, at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies. 14,15 <lb/>In the visible, semiconductor monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WS 2 <lb/>are good candidates for guiding light using SEPs. TMD monolayers host excitons with a high oscillator <lb/>strength, producing a dramatic permittivity oscillation around the exciton energy. 16 As a result, excitons <lb/>in TMDs can strongly reflect electromagnetic radiation and act as atomically thin mirrors. 17-19 <lb/>Interestingly, excitons can be tuned electrically, optically, magnetically, thermally, or mechanically, 19-<lb/>23 opening a promising avenue for active nanophotonic devices. Several theoretical works have dealt <lb/>with the excitation of SEPs in monolayers and their coupling to nearby emitters. 23-25 A report proposed <lb/>that a monolayer could support SEPs and predicted confinement to within 2 m of the monolayer with <lb/></body>

        <body>propagation lengths exceeding 100 m. 26 Although the near-zero thickness of the monolayer can <lb/>support waveguide modes, they are loosely confined to the TMD monolayer and require a symmetric <lb/>refractive index medium. One possibility to increase confinement is patterning the monolayer into a <lb/>photonic crystal, which has been demonstrated for suspended structures. 27 For unpatterned monolayers, <lb/>however, the proximity of the guided mode to the light line complicates experimental detection due to <lb/>the requirement for a perfectly symmetric optical environment with low scattering. 28 Furthermore, <lb/>detection relies critically on achieving narrow excitonic linewidths, which can require cryogenic <lb/>temperatures. 29 <lb/>Here, we address the fundamental challenge of guiding light bound to atomically thin <lb/>semiconductors. We propose van der Waals superlattices based on semiconductor-insulator-<lb/>semiconductor heterostructures to improve the propagation characteristics of surface exciton-polaritons <lb/>(Figure 1a). We show the existence of both TE and TM guided modes and compare their dispersion <lb/>relations in monolayers, heterostructures, and superlattices made of monolayer WS 2 and hexagonal <lb/>boron nitride. Compared to negligible confinement in a monolayer, we demonstrate increased <lb/>confinement of the TE mode in heterostructures. Then, we clarify the impact of the thickness of the <lb/>spacer layer on the guided modes. In the ultrathin film approximation, we find that the decay constants <lb/>of the TE and TM modes supported by heterostructures follow simple additivity rules for their <lb/>constituent layers. Additionally, we investigate the electrostatic tuning of the modes. To guide <lb/>experimental realizations under different excitation conditions, we investigate the differences between <lb/>two approaches for solving the modes of the superlattices using either a complex in-plane wave vector, <lb/> or a complex frequency, . Our study thus produces specific directions to tailor and tune guided <lb/>modes in semiconductor monolayer superlattices as a platform for nanoscale photonic and <lb/>optoelectronic devices. <lb/>Strong exciton oscillator strength and permittivity <lb/>We use WS 2 monolayers due to their strong exciton oscillator strength and narrow linewidth, which are <lb/>better than in other semiconductors at room temperature and result in a record absorption coefficient. <lb/></body>

The field is confined in the out-of-plane direction, while the <lb/>wave propagates in the plane. Heterostructures contribute to increased confinement of the TE mode and <lb/>reduced confinement of the TM mode. <lb/>The permittivity oscillation around the exciton energy in Figure 1b is so pronounced that the real <lb/>part of the permittivity, Re(), goes from positive to negative across the excitonic resonance. <lb/>Effectively, the material behaves optically like a high-refractive-index dielectric when Re() &gt;0 or a <lb/>reflective metal when Re() &lt; 0. These permittivities facilitate two regimes for guiding SEP waves: a <lb/>TE mode can be supported in the range of positive and high real permittivity (above 612.5 nm, orange <lb/>area), while a TM mode can be sustained where the condition Re(())+ Re( medium ) &lt; 0 is met (from <lb/>606.5 to 612.5 nm, green area). <lb/>Surface exciton-polaritons in monolayers and heterostructures <lb/>We consider a semiconductor monolayer as a thin film of thickness t with permittivity ε m clad between <lb/>two homogenous media with refractive indices n 1 and n 2 . Such a layered medium can support TE and <lb/>TM modes. To support a guided mode in monolayer WS 2 , however, the environment refractive index <lb/>must be nearly symmetric with n 1 ~ n 2 . Otherwise, a cut-off appears in the minimum required TMD <lb/>thickness (Supplementary Section S2). To study the mode propagation characteristics, we base our <lb/>calculations on the transfer-matrix method (see Methods). 33,34 Specifically, the matrix element M 22 must <lb/>be zero for a guided mode. We solve the equations numerically in the complex- plane to obtain the <lb/>real in-plane wave vector β of the supported guided mode (Supplementary Section S3) and evaluate its <lb/>effective width W eff = 1/Re(q) and effective SEP wavelength λ SEP = 2π/Re(β), where <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>q <lb/>c <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>is <lb/>the momentum in the out-of-plane direction in a given medium and it is known as the decay constant. <lb/>This method is appropriate for guided waves in any layered system, including atomically thin <lb/>superlattices. <lb/></body>

        <body>We use this method first to show that a WS 2 monolayer can support SEP modes at energies close <lb/>to the exciton. SEP waves propagate along the monolayer and decay evanescently in the perpendicular <lb/>direction (z-axis in Figure 1a). TE and TM modes can be excited in different energy ranges depending <lb/>on the sign of the monolayer permittivity. The TE mode is only supported when Re(ε m ) &gt; 0, while the <lb/>TM mode starts to appear as the sign of the permittivity changes to negative (Figure 1b, yellow and <lb/>green areas). The TE mode of a monolayer is very close to the light line (Figure 2a, black), with an <lb/>effective refractive index close to the surrounding medium. Close to the exciton energy <lb/>= 2.017 <lb/>eV, the SEP wave vector becomes higher than the light line, but this mode is still only loosely confined <lb/>to the monolayer. On the other hand, the TM mode is tightly confined to the monolayer, owing to the <lb/>proximity of the propagation constant to the exciton energy line. <lb/>To overcome the confinement challenges associated with monolayer WS 2 , we introduce a <lb/>hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer with a refractive index of 2.3 between two WS 2 monolayers. This <lb/>modification significantly alters the dispersion behavior of the TE and TM modes. In this <lb/>heterostructure, the bending of the dispersion curve starts further away from the exciton energy <lb/>compared to the monolayer and evolves more slowly with energy (Figure 2a, red). This enhanced mode <lb/>confinement facilitates experimental observation because loosely bound guided waves are easily <lb/>scattered by imperfections. <lb/>The mode profiles for a monolayer (Figure 1c, black lines) and a heterostructure (red) for the TE <lb/>and TM modes at energies of 2 and 2.0223 eV, respectively, illustrate the confinement close to the <lb/>monolayer. All modes show evanescent behavior outside the waveguide core, with the TM mode being <lb/>more confined than the TE mode. Using a heterostructure with an hBN spacer thickness of 1 nm <lb/>provides opportunities to customize the waveguide characteristics. When transitioning from a <lb/>monolayer to a heterostructure at an energy of 2 eV, the effective width of the TE mode is compressed <lb/>from 1.2 to approximately 0.5 µm (Figure 2b). For the TM mode at energies above the exciton peak, <lb/>the mode confinement exhibits the opposite behavior and becomes less tightly confined, with the TM-<lb/>mode width increasing from 47 to 90 nm for a heterostructure at an energy of 2.023 eV. <lb/></body>

Exciton-polariton wavelength as a function of <lb/>photon energy. <lb/>Contribution of the spacer to confinement <lb/>In heterostructures, the confinement of the guided mode depends on the insulator spacer thickness. <lb/>Increasing the spacer thickness typically increases the propagation constant of the TE mode. On the <lb/>other hand, the TM dispersion line moves towards the monolayer curve. To gain insight into these <lb/>modes, we evaluate the intensity modal profile for heterostructures with varying spacer thickness <lb/>(Figure 3a). The confinement of the TE mode at E = 2 eV is enhanced by an order of magnitude as the <lb/>spacer thickness goes from 1 to 100 nm. The TE mode shifts to higher β as the spacer thickness <lb/>increases, resulting in a more confined SEP width and a shorter SEP wavelength (Figures 3b and 3c). <lb/>This apparent confinement is, however, due to the introduction of a material with a higher refractive <lb/>index than the surrounding medium, which shifts the dispersion curve away from the PDMS light line <lb/>towards that of the spacer material. Similarly, for the TM mode, increasing the spacer thickness reduces <lb/>the width, resulting in higher confinement and shortening of the SEP wavelength (Figures 3b and 3c). <lb/></body>

Using the <lb/>ultrathin film approximation, we explicitly calculate the dependence of the decay constant of the <lb/>heterostructure, q hetero , on the constituent layers for both modes.

        <body>TM mode, on the other hand, the heterostructure decay constant is described by q TM,hetero = -2 ε Bg /(h ε hBN <lb/>+ t ε monolayer ), where ε Bg denotes the permittivity of the background medium, h and t represent the <lb/>thicknesses of the hBN layer and the semiconductor monolayer, respectively, and ε hBN and ε monolayer are <lb/>their corresponding permittivities (proof in Supplementary Section S5). These two additivity rules for <lb/>TE and TM modes demonstrate the simple but distinct relations between the permittivities and <lb/>thicknesses of the constituent layers and confinement in heterostructures. <lb/>We analyze first the behavior of the decay constant for the WS 2 monolayer and hBN layers alone. <lb/>The decay constant for the monolayer is a horizontal black line in Figures 4a and 4b, as there is no <lb/>spacer. If we consider an hBN film only, it supports a TE mode with increasing confinement for <lb/>increasing thickness (gray line in Figure 4a). Conversely, the TM mode is absent for hBN alone at this <lb/>photon energy due to its positive refractive index (no gray line in Figure 4b). For complete <lb/>heterostructures containing both WS 2 and hBN, we observe an excellent agreement between the decay <lb/>constants obtained using the analytical additivity rules (red lines in Figures 4a and 4b) and the <lb/>numerically simulated decay constants (dark red), particularly for small thicknesses below a few tens <lb/>of nanometers. <lb/>Engineering the guided modes in superlattices <lb/>A superlattice geometry -a heterostructure stack -can further improve the mode confinement and <lb/>make the SEP properties more appealing for nanophotonics. The TE mode moves away from the light <lb/>line for superlattices, providing higher confinement for an increasing number of monolayers (Figures <lb/>5a and 5b). The effective TE-mode width is 1.2, 0.5, and 0.3 m for one, two, and three monolayers, <lb/>respectively. The TM-mode width at E = 2.023 eV rises to 100 nm with three monolayers, suggesting <lb/>reduced confinement of the TM mode within the structure. The dispersion line moves away from the <lb/>exciton peak energy as we go from one to three monolayers (Figures 5a and 5b). <lb/></body>

        <body>dispersion relations and describe different experimental conditions for polariton excitation. 37 The <lb/>complex β approach is suitable when the excitation is a monochromatic wave localized in space, 36,39-41 <lb/>whereas a complex ω describes better pulsed or broadband excitation at a fixed angle. 42-46 In all our <lb/>results so far, we solved the guided modes using the complex-ω approach. Here, we compare the <lb/>dispersion relations obtained using the complex-β and complex-ω approaches. <lb/>For the complex-ω solutions, we observe an asymptote for large values of β for the TE and TM <lb/>modes (Figure 6a¸ gray lines). Instead, for the complex-β approach at a given real ω (purple lines), the <lb/>dispersion relation of the TE mode shows a back-bending limiting the maximum value of β. We remove <lb/>the unphysical branches from the complex- results because physically meaningful solutions should <lb/>have real and imaginary parts of the wave vector with the same sign. The TM-mode dispersion lines <lb/>occur within different energy ranges with a shift between complex-β and complex-ω solutions. The <lb/>reason for this shift is that when we keep ω as a real value and solve the mode equation, the obtained <lb/>β values possess a significant imaginary part for the TM mode. However, enforcing a real β requires <lb/>the film permittivity to be strongly negative. Negative permittivity only occurs near the exciton, which <lb/>shifts the obtained real part of ω closer to the exciton peak. We also compare the spacer thickness <lb/>dependence of the guided modes using both approaches. While the TE mode can propagate for any <lb/>spacer thickness, we obtain a cut-off thickness for the TM mode for a 1-nm hBN spacer (Supplementary <lb/>Section S6). Above this thickness, the effective total permittivity of the stack becomes positive, and no <lb/>TM mode is supported. <lb/>Focusing on specific energies, we observe a similar evolution of the effective mode width for both <lb/>approaches (Figure 6b). For complex , the TE mode at E = 2 eV is confined to around 0.55 m for the <lb/>heterostructure (red) compared to 1.15 m for the monolayer (black), whereas the TM mode at E = 2.03 <lb/>eV expands from 30 nm for the monolayer to 80 nm for the heterostructure. Additionally, the complex-<lb/>β approach allows us to calculate an additional SEP property: the propagation length, <lb/>= <lb/>1/(2 Im( )). For the monolayer, the TE and TM modes can propagate for approximately 30 m and <lb/>2 nm at energies of 2 and 2.03 eV, respectively (Figure 6c). For the heterostructure, the propagation <lb/></body>

The <lb/>TM mode propagation remains extremely dampened but improves to 4 nm. <lb/>Figure 6 | Dispersion relations in the complex-wave-vector and complex-frequency approaches. <lb/>a, Mode dispersion in a heterostructure obtained using the complex-β approach (purple) compared to <lb/>the complex-ω approach (gray), corresponding to different experimental situations.

We show that decreasing the <lb/>linewidth (or increasing the oscillator strength) is particularly beneficial for complex-β solutions of both <lb/>TE and TM modes.

The TE mode has a more pronounced back-bending line and higher <lb/>confinement using the narrowest linewidth, underscoring the need for high-quality excitons and <lb/>possibly low temperatures to ease observation in experiments described by the complex-β approach. 29 <lb/>In the complex-ω approach, adjustments to the linewidth do not significantly affect the dispersion. <lb/></body>

        <body>However, the propagation length exhibits changes because modifying the linewidth causes a shift in the <lb/>permittivity in the complex plane, bringing it closer to the real axis. <lb/>Figure 7 | Enhanced confinement for decreasing exciton linewidth   .

The heterostructure consists of two WS 2 <lb/>monolayers separated by a 0.3-nm-thick hBN spacer (i.e., one monolayer) in a symmetric PDMS <lb/>environment. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>We have investigated surface exciton-polaritons supported by atomically thin semiconductor-insulator-<lb/>semiconductor heterostructures and their superlattices. These guided waves rely on having strong <lb/>exciton resonances with high oscillator strength and narrow linewidth, which are present in WS 2 <lb/>monolayers even at room temperature. They also require a symmetric optical environment for <lb/>observation. Both TE and TM modes are possible for high-quality monolayers within spectral ranges <lb/>with positive and negative permittivities, respectively. Compared to the monolayer modes, the <lb/>heterostructure architecture modifies the effective width, exciton-polariton wavelength, and <lb/>propagation length.

        <body>further increase the TE mode confinement while decreasing it for the TM mode. We proposed strongly <lb/>controlling and modulating the guided modes by switching the monolayer excitons on and off. Finally, <lb/>we have shown that the surface exciton-polariton waves can be predicted with either a complex wave <lb/>vector or a complex frequency approach. These approaches provide qualitatively different mode <lb/>dispersions and properties. As they describe different experimental conditions, it is critical to consider <lb/>the right complex-plane approach to model a specific experiment. <lb/>The diverse tuning mechanisms of excitons in monolayer semiconductors provide a control knob <lb/>for guided waves based on changes to the exciton strength, linewidth, and peak energy. For example, <lb/>all-optical modulation due to lattice heating has been shown to substantially alter the reflectivity of <lb/>atomically thin mirrors 19 and could be used to modulate exciton-polaritons in space and time. Based on <lb/>our results and given the fast pace of developments in this area, atomically thin semiconductors hold <lb/>great promise for nanoscale tunable Photonics at visible wavelengths. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Transfer-matrix method <lb/>Consider two different media separated by a planar interface.

The <lb/>complete transfer matrix is the product of the interface and propagation matrices. For example, the <lb/>transfer matrix of a film waveguide based on a monolayer is M = M 3←2 P 2 M 2←1 . For a heterostructure <lb/>consisting of three stacked films, the transfer matrix has the form M= M 5←4 P 4 M 4←3 P 3 M 3←2 P 2 M 2←1 . <lb/>We require A 1 = B 2 = 0 to guarantee confinement so that the field vanishes at infinity. In addition, k zi <lb/>must have an imaginary component (and a vanishing real component if losses are neglected for the sake <lb/>of determining the dispersion relation) to have decaying fields at the bottom and top layers. For a guided <lb/>mode, the matrix element M 22 should be zero. Based on this condition, we can obtain the propagation <lb/>constant of the mode, as well as the field distribution in each layer. <lb/>This method remains applicable for both the complex-ω and complex-β approaches. The complex-<lb/>ω approach involves finding ω for each real value of β using a permittivity defined in the complex-ω <lb/>plane. The obtained ω from the mode solution is used to extend the permittivity in the complex-ω plane <lb/>using the 4-Lorentzian model (Supplementary Sections S1 and S3). Consequently, the permittivity for <lb/>the complex-ω approach encompasses two branches, one for the TE mode and another for the TM mode, <lb/>each requiring the determination of complex ω independently.

        <div type="annex">Supplementary Section S2. Symmetry requirement for guiding light in atomically thin <lb/>waveguides <lb/>We examine a slab waveguide model that includes a monolayer of WS 2 , characterized by a refractive <lb/>index n ML and surrounded by media with refractive indices n 1 and n 2 (Supplementary S2a). We <lb/>aim to understand how differences in these refractive indices impact the cutoff thickness for both the <lb/>transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, which is a critical parameter that defines <lb/>the minimum thickness at which the waveguide can support a given mode. By solving Maxwell&apos;s <lb/>equations for both modes, we find the cutoff thicknesses in Supplementary Equations S1 and S2: <lb/>ℎ <lb/>, <lb/>= <lb/>[ <lb/>/ <lb/>] <lb/>/ <lb/>S1 <lb/>ℎ <lb/>, <lb/>= <lb/>[ <lb/>/ <lb/>] <lb/>/ <lb/>S2 <lb/>In the case of a symmetric slab waveguide with 1 = 2 , the cutoff thicknesses for the fundamental TE <lb/>and TM modes are zero. We plot the relation between the cutoff thickness and the refractive index <lb/>mismatch ∆n=n 2 -n 1 . The cutoff thickness for both TE and TM modes at the wavelengths of 615 and <lb/>608 nm decreases when Δn is reduced, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S2b. The cutoff thickness <lb/>dependence suggests a sensitivity of waveguiding on small changes in refractive index. In the case of a <lb/>single-layer-thick slab, it is crucial to limit Δn below 5% for the TE mode to ensure light guiding. The <lb/>TM mode is even more susceptible to refractive index mismatch: the mode ceases to exist for index <lb/>variations of 0.006% in a PDMS environment. On the other hand, as the wavelength increases compared <lb/>to the wavelengths above, the requirements for the symmetric index environment become less stringent <lb/></div>

Finding the guided modes <lb/>We perform numerical simulations for a layered waveguide system using the transfer-matrix method (as <lb/>described in the Methods section) for monolayers and heterostructures using different complex planes. <lb/>Our dispersion calculations rely on finding the correct poles in the complex plane. To find a guided <lb/>mode, we search for the roots of M 22 = 0 in the complex plane, which provides the first iteration of the <lb/>solution for our numerical calculation. In the complex- approach, we sweep the complex values of  <lb/>while keeping the wave vector  real and fixed. The complex-plane shows the position of the zero at <lb/>a particular value of =15 µm -1 for the TE and TM modes (Supplementary Figure S3a, top and bottom). <lb/>In contrast, in the real-valued  approach, we tune while  remains constant (Supplementary Figure <lb/></div>

        <div type="annex">S3b). Then, we use this initial solution in our simulation to evaluate the dispersion and its corresponding <lb/>propagation characteristics. <lb/>This methodology remains applicable to both the complex-ω and complex-β approaches. In the <lb/>complex-ω approach, the acquired ω from the mode solution is then employed to evaluate the <lb/>permittivity in the complex plane, using the 4-Lorentzian model (see above). As a result, the permittivity <lb/>for the complex-ω approach encompasses two branches, one related to the TE mode and another one <lb/>associated with the TM mode, each requiring an independent determination of a complex ω value <lb/>(Supplementary Figure S4). On the contrary, the complex-β approach involves the determination of the <lb/>real and imaginary parts of β with a permittivity defined at each real value of ω (Supplementary Figure <lb/>S1). <lb/>Supplementary Figure S3 | Example of the evaluation of the first iteration solutions for TE and <lb/>TM modes.

        <div type="annex">= <lb/>. <lb/>To calculate the minimum thickness of the spacer, we set the denominator to zero: <lb/>ℎ <lb/>= <lb/>( ) <lb/>. <lb/>Therefore, when utilizing this analytical theory and applying the small-thickness approximation in the <lb/>complex-β plane with a real ω, the cutoff length is independent of the permittivity of the substrate and <lb/>superstrate, and it depends only on the properties of the spacer. We identify the following cutoff <lb/>thicknesses for different spacer materials: 5.33 nm for air, 2.64 nm for PDMS, and 1 nm for hBN. Above <lb/>these values, the effective total permittivity becomes positive, and the structure can no longer support <lb/>the usual TM mode. The TE mode, on the other hand, has no cutoff. <lb/>Supplementary Section S6. Influence of the insulator spacer on the guided modes for the <lb/>complex-ω and complex-β approaches <lb/>The dependence of the TE guided mode on the spacer thickness in the complex-β approach agrees with <lb/>the complex-ω one, as shown in Supplementary Figure S7a. However, the effect of increasing the spacer <lb/>thickness on the TM mode in the complex-β approach is clearly different from the complex-ω approach, <lb/>as shown in Supplementary Figure S7b. To clarify this difference, we evaluate the derivative of the <lb/>propagation constant with respect to the spacer thickness, dβ/dh, which has the same sign as β 2 according <lb/>to the previous derivation. When considering the complex-ω approach, where β takes a real value, the <lb/>quantity dβ/dh is found to be positive. This indicates that the derivative increases as the thickness of the <lb/>spacer increases, thereby positively impacting the TM mode. Conversely, in the complex-β approach, <lb/>where β is primarily an imaginary number, the derivative dβ/dh is negative. This suggests that, as the <lb/>spacer thickness increases, the derivative decreases, exerting an opposite influence on the TM mode <lb/>compared to solving the mode in the complex-ω plane. <lb/></div>
