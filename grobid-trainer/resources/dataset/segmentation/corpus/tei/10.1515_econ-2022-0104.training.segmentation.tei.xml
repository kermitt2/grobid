        <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Diffractive deep neural networks (D 2 NNs) [1] constitute a <lb/>burgeoning all-optical machine learning framework, pro-<lb/>cessing task-specific information modulation via the manip-<lb/>ulation of input coherent light fields via a successive passive <lb/>diffractive layers. These layers comprised of numerous indi-<lb/>vidual phase and amplitude modulation units and multiple <lb/>free-space propagation. With appropriate phase and ampli-<lb/>tude distribution of each layers, D 2 NNs can fit arbitrary <lb/>complex-valued linear transformations between input field-<lb/>of-view and output field-of-view [2]-[4]. The phase or ampli-<lb/>tude distribution of each layer can be inversely optimized <lb/>by conventional deep learning methods such as stochastic <lb/>gradient descent and error back-propagation. D 2 NNs have <lb/>been expected to be an alternative to electronic systems as <lb/>a task-specific computing device owing to its advantages <lb/>in power efficiency, low latency, and parallelization capa-<lb/>bilities. They have been demonstrated remarkable perfor-<lb/>mance in various applications, including object recognition <lb/>[1], [5]-[8], spectrum control [9], [10], and logical computing <lb/>[11], [12]. Recent researches has explored ways to enhance <lb/>the complexity and information processing capabilities of <lb/>D 2 NNs by introducing polarization [13], wavelength mul-<lb/>tiplexing [14], and optoelectronic networks [6], [15], [16]. <lb/>However, the basic unit of each layer employs the diffractive <lb/>optical elements (DOEs) which are fabricated with commer-<lb/>cial 3D-printers, the scale of these conventional thickness-<lb/>based modulation units for phase and amplitude modula-<lb/>tions are comparable to the wavelength which limites the <lb/>potential of miniaturization and integration of D 2 NNs, thus <lb/>this kind of nets suffers the drawbacks of low resolution <lb/>and low efficiency due to the introduction of high-order <lb/>diffraction. <lb/>Metasurface is a kind of two-dimensional artificial elec-<lb/>tromagnetic material, which consists of subwavelength-<lb/>scale optical microstructure units also named optical anten-<lb/>nas [17]-[19]. It can be used to arbitrarily modulate the prop-<lb/>erties of the scattered wave, including frequency, amplitude, <lb/>phase, and polarization, based on the electromagnetic res-<lb/>onances excited by electromagnetic waves and periodic or <lb/>non-periodic arranged optical antennas.

        <body>of each modulation parameter can be adjusted within a con-<lb/>siderably wide range by changing the geometrical parame-<lb/>ter of the optical antennas, e.g., shape, size, or arrangement. <lb/>With its unique characteristics of high integration, free from <lb/>high-order diffraction, and high modulation degrees of free-<lb/>dom, metasurface has distinct advantages in optical infor-<lb/>mation processing field. In recent years, metasurfaces have <lb/>been used to archive various functions, such as holography <lb/>[20]-[26], special beam generation [27]-[31], and polariza-<lb/>tion modulation [32]-[36]. For resent years, artificial intelli-<lb/>gence (AI) and deep learning methods has been introduced <lb/>into metasurfaces, improving the flexibility of metasurface <lb/>devices [37]-[40]. <lb/>In this paper, we will introduce metasurfaces into <lb/>D 2 NNs and design an optical half-adder in the terahertz <lb/>frequency range to experimentally verify our approach. As <lb/>shown in Figure 1, all dielectric silicon cylinder metasur-<lb/>faces are used as diffractive layers. The diameter value of <lb/>each cylinder in the metasurfaces, simulated using a finite-<lb/>difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm, corresponds to <lb/>the required pure phase modulation value in the range of <lb/>0 to 2𝜋 after 16-level quantization. The phase distributions <lb/>of layers are numerically optimized via conventional D 2 NNs <lb/>methods (i.e., stochastic gradient descent and error back-<lb/>propagation) in a computer. The metasurface-based D 2 NNs <lb/>can be more compact and more efficient than conventional <lb/>terahertz DOEs networks, escaping from the restrictions <lb/>of high-order diffraction and fabrication precision. 40,000 <lb/>neurons (micro-cylinders) are integrated into each metasur-<lb/>face layer with a spatial size of only 2 × 2 cm 2 where each <lb/>micro-cylinder has a size of 100 × 100 μm 2 is significantly <lb/>smaller than the working wavelength (353 μm). The final <lb/>results demonstrate that our design can achieves power-<lb/>ful computing capability comparable to the state-of-the-art <lb/>DOE-based D 2 NNs. The metasurface-based D 2 NN can fur-<lb/>ther facilitate miniaturization and integration of all optical <lb/>digital computing components. It is suitable to be imple-<lb/>mented on space-constrained computing applications, e.g., <lb/>6G communication, photonics integrated circuits, and intel-<lb/>ligent sensor. The metasurface can endow new degrees of <lb/>freedom to D 2 NN. It is believed that the metasurface-based <lb/>D 2 NNs can provide a robust and innovative framework <lb/>for all optical computing, and explore a new direction for <lb/>optical neural networks. With future complete utilization of <lb/>unique property of metasurface, such as high integration, <lb/>polarization controlling, and optical non-linear, this frame-<lb/>work will serve as a potent engine for development of all <lb/>optical computing devices. <lb/>2 Results <lb/>To perform the addition computing task with optical net-<lb/>work, the input and output signals are encoded in spa-<lb/>tial intensity distributions, as shown in Figure 2.

        <body>Figure 2: Architectonics and encoding method for the metasurface-<lb/>based half-adder. Two layers of the metasurface-based half-adder <lb/>receive two 1-bit spatial intensity signals and generate a 2-bit spatial <lb/>intensity output signal while both input and output are encoded with the <lb/>distribution of light intensity within special ranges. Input apertures are <lb/>set to 4 × 4 mm 2 which are larger than the output apertures <lb/>(1.6 × 1.6 mm 2 ) to utilize more energy. <lb/>information is encoded by a pair of square apertures, simi-<lb/>larly to the previous work [12]. The decoded binary number <lb/>is 0 or 1 is determined by the relative power of upper or <lb/>lower apertures. If the relative power in the upper aperture <lb/>is higher than 50 %, it means the binary number is 1, else if <lb/>the relative power in the lower aperture is higher than 50 % <lb/>the binary number is 0. The 2-bit output pattern is the com-<lb/>bination of two 1-bit patterns. Both input and output planes <lb/>have four designed square areas to carry information. Input <lb/>apertures are set as 4 × 4 mm 2 which are larger than the <lb/>output apertures (1.6 × 1.6 mm 2 ) to utilize more energy for <lb/>computing. The expanded input aperture can increase the <lb/>input energy and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the <lb/>results. <lb/>To suit the space-constrained application requirement, <lb/>a two-layer network has been trained for the 1-bit half-<lb/>adder. Every neurons are optimized during iteration of <lb/>epoch using standard deep learning tools after random <lb/>initialization. The loss value is calculated from the output <lb/>of each forward propagation using the MES loss function <lb/>(refer to Appendix A for further details) and a backward <lb/>propagation is performed using the Adam optimizer sub-<lb/>sequently. The curves of the loss and corresponding aver-<lb/>age energy efficiency are shown in Figure 3(a). It can be <lb/>Figure 3: Optimized results of the metasurface-based half-adder. <lb/>(a) Dependence of loss and energy on the training epochs. <lb/>(b) Optimized phase distributions of two layers. <lb/>(c) Physical images of two layers fabricated on silicon substrates. <lb/>observed that gradients tend to approach zero as the iter-<lb/>ations increase, indicating the training has converged and <lb/>most of the energy has been concentrated in the desired <lb/>square apertures. To indicate the degree of the energy is <lb/>concentrated into the correct regions, the average energy <lb/>(AE) is defined as: <lb/>AE = <lb/>1 <lb/>4I i <lb/>4 <lb/>∑ <lb/>1 <lb/>(I b1 + I b2 ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where I i is the total energy on the input plane, which is a <lb/>constant for the simulation program. 1 <lb/>4 <lb/>∑ 4 <lb/>1 represents the <lb/>calculating the average energy of all four output, I b1 and I b2 <lb/>are the energy of the first and second bit in its correct area, <lb/>represented by: <lb/>I b1,b2 = <lb/>∑ <lb/>n∈right area <lb/>| <lb/>| E n <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>2 , <lb/>(2) <lb/></body>

        <body>where E n is the electric field of the nth pixel on the output <lb/>plane. <lb/>As a result, two phase distributions have been opti-<lb/>mized, as depicted in Figure 3(b). The phase values of 200 <lb/>× 200 neurons are warped into the ranges of -𝜋 to 𝜋. <lb/>The metasurface are fabricated on silicon substrates where <lb/>the neurons is expressed with the corresponding micro-<lb/>cylinders designed by the FDTD simulation after 16-level <lb/>quantization (refer to Appendix A for further details). The <lb/>photos of fabricated metasurfaces are shown in Figure 3(c). <lb/>The metasurfaces with the size of 2 × 2 cm 2 are placed at <lb/>the central position of silicon substrates. There are some <lb/>etch lines at the edges for alignment, and the similar struc-<lb/>ture have also been used in previous research [41]. The <lb/>distance between the diffractive layers is set as 10 cm and <lb/>the distances between the input plane to the first layer and <lb/>the second layer to the output plane are selected as 2 cm. <lb/>Several measurements are carried out to mitigate against <lb/>the misalignment error among the input plane, diffractive <lb/>layers, and output plane. <lb/>The numerical and experimental results are shown in <lb/>Figure 4, including overall 4 kinds of possible input of the <lb/>half-adder. The simulated and experimental intensity dis-<lb/>tributions on the output plane are presented in Figure 4(a) <lb/>and (b), respectively. The four apertures, which carry infor-<lb/>mation, are marked by the red-bordered square. The value <lb/>of binary number is determined by the relative power in <lb/>the upper and lower red-bordered areas. Through pixel-<lb/>by-pixel summing and comparison, the decoded binary <lb/>results and energy distributions of four designed regions <lb/>are depicted in Figure 4(c) and (d), where the energy distri-<lb/>butions of up aperture (E up ) and down aperture (E down ) are <lb/>calculated as: <lb/>E up = <lb/>I up <lb/>I up + I down <lb/>, <lb/>E down = <lb/>I down <lb/>I up + I down <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where I up and I low represent the total intensity in the upper <lb/>and lower square aperture, respectively. <lb/>The decoding processing from spatial intensity infor-<lb/>mation to binary numbers is equivalent to performing a <lb/>binarization of energy distribution with a threshold of 50 %. <lb/>The darker orange squares in Figure 4(c) and (d) represent <lb/>higher energy comparing to the other aperture in the same <lb/>bit pattern, i.e., correct output aperture for this bit. Benefit <lb/>from the enough contrast between the energy concentrated <lb/>in the different apertures, the computing results can be rec-<lb/>ognized and decoded easily, which indicates the proposed <lb/>half-adder can implements the optical addition computing <lb/>well, like the state-of-the-art DOE-based D 2 NN. <lb/>Figure 4: Simulation and experiment results of the metasurface-based <lb/>half-adder. (a) The simulation results of intensity distribution <lb/>on the output plane, (b) the experiment results of intensity distribution <lb/>on the output plane, (c) the energy distribution of simulation result, and <lb/>(d) the energy distribution of experiment result. <lb/>3 Discussion and conclusions <lb/>In conclusion, we have successfully introduced the meta-<lb/>surface into D 2 NNs, taking a significant stride towards <lb/>the advancement of all optical computing technology. The <lb/>diffractive layers in the proposed network are adopted <lb/>with all-dielectric cylinder metasurfaces, which are not only <lb/>compact and thin but also can overcome the limitations of <lb/>conventional DOE, such as high-order diffraction and low <lb/>spatial utilization. An optical half-adder is demonstrated in <lb/>the terahertz frequency range. However, the volume of opti-<lb/>cal computing system is not only determined by diffractive <lb/>layers, but also relies on the distance between each device. <lb/>To mitigate against the misalignment error, the distance <lb/>between diffractive layers of half-adder is still relatively <lb/>large which increases the volume of optical computing sys-<lb/>tem, which can be decreased by using more precise holder <lb/>or training a misalignment resilient network [42]. <lb/>This work successfully establishes a compact and pow-<lb/>erful all optical computing framework. It validates the feasi-<lb/>bility of transplanting D 2 NNs to metasurface. The design just <lb/>utilize one of characteristics of metasurface, i.e., high inte-<lb/>gration, more characteristic of the metasurface, e.g., polar-<lb/>ization controlling, direction choosing, and optical non-<lb/>linear effect, can be concentrated to increase the degree <lb/></body>

In order to reduce this misalignment error in the <lb/>experiment, a holder shown in Figure 6(c) is manufactured <lb/>using a 3D printer, the meatsurfaces are fixed in the holder. <lb/>Some marks are etched along with structures, as shown in <lb/>Figure 3(c), for better alignment. <lb/>Appendix B: Misalignment error <lb/>analysis <lb/>The number of layers and the distance between diffractive <lb/>layers will affect the robustness of the system. The numer-<lb/>ical simulations are carried out to aid us to find the better <lb/>parameters. The same input is fed into the diffractive net-<lb/>work, a random shift between adjacent diffractive layers is <lb/>used to simulate the misalignment error. Figure 7 presents <lb/>the variation of energy efficiency and accuracy with respect <lb/>to the distance and misalignment. It can be seen that the <lb/>energy focused in the correct area and the accuracy of the <lb/>output will inevitably decrease as the misalignment error <lb/>increases from 0 to 1000 μm. However, the impact of mis-<lb/>alignment declines as the distance between two metasur-<lb/>face layers increases. When the diffractive of a pixel on <lb/>the previous layer cannot cover all pixels on the next layer, <lb/>the system becomes more sensitive to misalignment errors. <lb/>Considering the information loss with increasing diffraction <lb/>distance, a compromise distance of 10 cm is selected in the <lb/>experiment. <lb/>The effect of layer numbers on the performances and <lb/>robustness of system is also investigated numerically. The <lb/>reasoning capability and the information processing capac-<lb/>ity will increase as the number of layers increases, had <lb/>been proved in previous research [3]. However, the aver-<lb/>age energy and accuracy will significantly decrease with <lb/>misalignment errors for multi-layer system, as shown in <lb/>Figure 8, which will bring additional challenges to the exper-<lb/>iment. Considering the space-constricted target application, <lb/>the performance of a two-layer adder is sufficient to com-<lb/>plete the computing task. <lb/></div>
