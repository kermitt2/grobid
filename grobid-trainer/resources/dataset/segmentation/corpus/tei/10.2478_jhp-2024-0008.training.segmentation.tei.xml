        <body>1 Introduction <lb/>Let M be a hypersurface in an (n + 1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold and denote by k 1 , … , k n its princi-<lb/>pal curvatures. The r-th mean curvature of M is the elementary symmetric polynomial H r in the variables k i <lb/>defined as <lb/>( n <lb/>r <lb/>) <lb/>H r := <lb/>∑ <lb/>i 1 &lt;…&lt;i r <lb/>k i 1 k i 2 … k i r . <lb/>We say that M is an H r -hypersurface when H r is a positive constant for some r ∈ {1, … , n}. Note in particu-<lb/>lar that H 1 is the mean curvature of M. In his pioneering work [1], Reilly showed that H r -hypersurfaces in space <lb/>forms appear as solutions of a variational problem, thus extending the corresponding property of constant mean <lb/>curvature surfaces. Earlier, Alexandrov had dealt with higher mean curvature functions in a series of papers <lb/>[2], and later on many existence and classification results were achieved in space forms. A list of contributions <lb/>to this subject (far from exhaustive) is [3]-[16]. <lb/>Studies on H r -hypersurfaces in more general ambient manifolds appeared in the literature more recently, <lb/>see for example [17]-[20]. Most notable for us are the results of Elbert and Sa Earp [21] on H r -hypersurfaces in <lb/></body>

        <body>ℍ n × ℝ, where ℍ n is the hyperbolic space and de Lima-Manfio-dos Santos [22] on H r -hypersurfaces in N × ℝ, <lb/>where N is a Riemannian manifold. <lb/>The goal of this paper is two-fold. Our first result is a complete classification of rotationally invariant H r -<lb/>hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ. Note that ℍ n × ℝ has non-constant sectional curvature, but it is symmetric enough <lb/>to allow a fruitful investigation of invariant hypersurfaces. The mean curvature case r = 1 has already been <lb/>studied by Hsiang-Hsiang in [7] and Bérard and Sa Earp [23]. A general study of H r -hypersurfaces invariant by <lb/>an ambient isometry in N × ℝ, with N a Riemannian manifold, has been carried out by de Lima-Manfio-dos <lb/>Santos [22]. We point out that part of our classification results are included in [22], but our description and <lb/>focus are different in nature for several reasons. First, we use a parametrization that allows us to consider <lb/>and analyze hypersurfaces with singularities. In fact, we get 13 different qualitative behaviors for rotational <lb/>H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ. Moreover, we always include the case n = r, which often produces exceptional <lb/>examples. Finally, we provide detailed topological and geometric descriptions for all values of the parameters <lb/>involved. <lb/>The geometry of H r -hypersurfaces with r ≥ 2 is substantially different than that of constant mean curvature <lb/>hypersurfaces. This is mainly due to the full non-linearity of the relation among the principal curvatures, in <lb/>contrast with the quasi-linearity of the mean curvature equation. Most importantly, many singular cases arise <lb/>and need to be classified. For instance, one gets conical singularities, which are not allowed in the constant mean <lb/>curvature case. Our classification results are summarized in Tables 1-3. <lb/>We recall that H r -hypersurfaces invariant by rotations in space forms were studied by Leite and Mori [8], <lb/>[9] for the case r = 2, and Palmas [13] for any r. <lb/>Our second goal is to understand the topology of embedded H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × [0, ∞) with boundary <lb/>in the horizontal slice ℍ n × {0}. We prove the following Ros-Rosenberg type theorem. <lb/>Theorem. Let M be a compact connected hypersurface in ℍ n × [0, ∞) with constant H r &gt; (n -r)∕n and boundary <lb/>in the slice ℍ n × {0}. When the boundary is sufficiently small and horoconvex, then M is a topological disk. <lb/>Horoconvexity of the boundary is a natural assumption in the hyperbolic space, whereas what &quot;sufficiently <lb/>small&quot; means will be explained more precisely in Section 6, cf. Theorem 6.1. A fundamental tool in our proof is <lb/>Alexandrov reflection tecnhique, for which one needs a tangency principle. For H r -hypersurfaces in Riemannian <lb/>manifolds, such a tangency principle is proved by Fontenele-Silva [24] under suitable assumptions. We point <lb/>out that the geometry of our hypersurfaces implies the existence of a strictly convex point, which guarantees <lb/>the validity of the tangency principle (see Remark 6.3). <lb/>Analogous results as in the above theorem for the constant mean curvature case are due to Ros-Rosenberg <lb/>in ℝ 3 [25, Theorem 1], Semmler in ℍ 3 [26, Theorem 2], and Nelli-Pipoli in ℍ n × ℝ [27, Theorem 4.1]. For H r -<lb/>hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, Ros-Rosenberg theorem is proved by Nelli-Semmler [11, Theorem 1.2]. <lb/>In order to prove our Ros-Rosenberg type theorem we also need to discuss certain H r -hypersurfaces that <lb/>are invariant under hyperbolic translation. <lb/>The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we classify H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ with rota-<lb/>tional symmetry. Since the cases r even and odd exhibit substantial differences, we treat them separately in two <lb/>subsections. At the end of each one, we provide complete descriptions of the various hypersurfaces that occur, <lb/>see Theorems 2.9-2.12, 2.21-2.24, and Tables 1-3. In Section 3 we study specific translation H r -hypersurfaces, cf. <lb/>Theorem 3.5. Finally, in Section 4 and 5 we provide useful estimates and tools to be employed in Section 6, where <lb/>we prove Ros-Rosenberg&apos;s Theorem (see Theorem 6.1). <lb/>2 Classification of rotation H r -hypersurfaces <lb/>We will generally use the Poincaré model of the hyperbolic space ℍ n , n ≥ 2. This is defined as the open ball of <lb/>Euclidean unit radius in ℝ n centered at the origin, and is equipped with the metric g that at a point x ∈ ℍ n takes <lb/>the form <lb/></body>

        <body>gx := <lb/>( <lb/>2 <lb/>1 -‖x‖ 2 <lb/>) 2 ( <lb/>dx 2 <lb/>1 + • • • + dx 2 <lb/>n <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>where ‖ ⋅ ‖ denotes the Euclidean norm, and (x i ) i are the standard coordinates in ℝ n . We work with the Rieman-<lb/>nian cylinder ℍ n × ℝ with product metric g := g + dt 2 , where t is a global coordinate on the ℝ factor. <lb/>In order to describe rotational hypersurfaces inside ℍ n × ℝ we follow [21]. Up to isometry of the ambient <lb/>space, a rotationally invariant hypersurface is determined by rotation of a profile curve contained in a vertical <lb/>plane through the origin inside ℍ n × ℝ. Let us take the plane <lb/>V := {(x 1 , … , x n , t) ∈ ℍ n × ℝ: x 1 = • • • = x n-1 = 0}, <lb/>and consider the curve parametrized by 𝜌 &gt; 0 given as <lb/>x n = tanh(𝜌∕2), <lb/>t = 𝜆(𝜌). <lb/>The function 𝜆 will be determined by imposing that the rotational hypersurface generated by the profile <lb/>curve have r-th mean curvature equal to a positive constant. We already defined the r-th mean curvature in the <lb/>Introduction, but we write it here for further references. <lb/>Definition 2.1. Let k 1 , … , k n be the principal curvatures of an immersed hypersurface in any Riemannian <lb/>manifold. The r-th mean curvature H r is the elementary symmetric polynomial defined as <lb/>( n <lb/>r <lb/>) <lb/>H r := <lb/>∑ <lb/>i 1 &lt;•••&lt;i r <lb/>k i 1 k i 2 … k i r . <lb/>Rotating the curve about the line {0} × ℝ generates a hypersurface with parametrization <lb/>ℝ + × S n-1 → ℍ n × ℝ, <lb/>(𝜌, 𝜉) ↦ (tanh(𝜌∕2)𝜉, 𝜆(𝜌)). <lb/>The unit normal field to the immersion is <lb/>𝜈 = <lb/>1 <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>( <lb/>-<lb/>λ <lb/>2 cosh 2 (𝜌∕2) <lb/>𝜉, 1 <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>and the associated principal curvatures are <lb/>k 1 = • • • = k n-1 = cotgh(𝜌) <lb/>λ <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>, <lb/>k n = <lb/>λ <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where λ denotes the derivative of 𝜆 with respect to 𝜌. By applying suitable vertical reflections or translations <lb/>of the hypersurface generated by the curve defined by 𝜆, one gets several types of rotationally invariant hyper-<lb/>surfaces. Care should be taken when applying the transfomation 𝜆 ↦ -𝜆, as this changes the orientation of <lb/>the hypersurface. However, setting 𝜈 ↦ -𝜈 leaves the signs of each k i unchanged. Hereafter we classify those <lb/>rotationally invariant hypersurfaces with positive constant r-th mean curvature. <lb/>Specializing the expression of the r-th mean curvature to the case k 1 = • • • = k n-1 and k n as in (1) we find <lb/>nH r = (n -r)cotgh r (𝜌) <lb/>λr <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>r <lb/>2 <lb/>+ cotgh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>r λr-1 <lb/>λ <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>r+2 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>If we divide by cosh r-1 (𝜌) and multiply by sinh n-1 (𝜌) both sides of the identity, we can rewrite the above as <lb/>n <lb/>sinh n-1 (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>H r = <lb/>d <lb/>d𝜌 <lb/>( <lb/>sinh n-r (𝜌) <lb/>λr <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>r <lb/>2 <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>r = 1, … , n. <lb/>(2) <lb/></body>

        <body>Choose now H r to be a positive constant, and define the function <lb/>I n,r (𝜌) := <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>sinh n-1 (𝜏) <lb/>cosh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>d𝜏. <lb/>We can then integrate (2) once to obtain <lb/>nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r = sinh n-r (𝜌) <lb/>λr <lb/>(1 + λ2 ) <lb/>r <lb/>2 <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where d r is an integration constant depending on r. Then one integrates again to find (up to a sign for r even) <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌) = <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜌 -<lb/>(nH r I n,r (𝜉) + d r ) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>sinh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r <lb/>(𝜉) -(nH r I n,r (𝜉) + d r ) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>d𝜉, <lb/>(4) <lb/>where 𝜌 -≥ 0 is the infimum of the set where the integrand function makes sense. One should think of 𝜆 as a <lb/>one-parameter family of functions depending on d r . We write 𝜆 H r ,d r as in (4) to make the dependence on H r and <lb/>d r more explicit. <lb/>Remark 2.2. When r is even, the right-hand side in (3) is non-negative, which forces the left-hand side to be <lb/>non-negative as well. In this case -𝜆 satisfies (3). When r is odd, identity (3) implies that λ has the same sign of <lb/>nH r I n,r + d r . Moreover, -𝜆 satisfies (3) only after changing 𝜈 ↦ -𝜈. Lastly, critical points for 𝜆 H r ,d r are zeros of <lb/>nH r I n,r + d r . The second derivative of 𝜆 H r ,d r is computed as <lb/>λH r ,d r (𝜌) = <lb/>cosh(𝜌) sinh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r -1 (𝜌) <lb/>( <lb/>nH r <lb/>sinh n (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r (𝜌) -(n -r)(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) <lb/>) <lb/>r(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) <lb/>r-1 <lb/>r <lb/>( <lb/>sinh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r <lb/>(𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>) 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>(5) <lb/>We will refer to this expression when studying the convexity of 𝜆 H r ,d r and its regularity up to second order. <lb/>Note that if r &gt; 1 the second derivative of 𝜆 H r ,d r is not defined at its critical points. <lb/>Remark 2.3. Let us discuss a few more details on I n,r . It is clear that I n,r (0) = 0 and I ′ <lb/>n,r (0) = 0. Also, I ′ <lb/>n,r (𝜌) &gt; 0 <lb/>and I ′′ <lb/>n,r (𝜌) &gt; 0 for 𝜌 &gt; 0 and all n ≥ r ≥ 1, so I n,r is a non-negative increasing convex function. For all values n ≥ r <lb/>we have nI n,r (𝜌) ≈ 𝜌 n for 𝜌 → 0. Moreover, for n &gt; r, one has the asymptotic behavior (n -r)I n,r (𝜌) ≈ sinh n-r (𝜌) <lb/>for 𝜌 → +∞, whereas for n = r we have I n,n (𝜌) ≈ 𝜌 for 𝜌 → +∞. <lb/>Next, we analyze 𝜆 H r ,d r as in (4) for all values of r = 1, … , n, H r &gt; 0, and d r ∈ ℝ. The goal is to find the <lb/>domain of 𝜆 H r ,d r , study its qualitative behavior, and describe the rotational H r -hypersurfaces generated by the <lb/>graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , including the description of their singularities. This can be thought of as a classification à la <lb/>Delaunay of rotational H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ. Note that we choose n, r, and H r &gt; 0 a priori, so that the <lb/>family of functions 𝜆 H r ,d r really depends only on the parameter d r . We will find a critical value of H r , namely <lb/>(n -r)∕n, which we use together with the sign of d r and the parity of r to distinguish various cases. Also, we <lb/>discuss n &gt; r and n = r separately, as the latter case exhibits substantial differences from the former. One may <lb/>find the salient properties of the classified hypersurfaces in Tables 1-3 at the end of this section. <lb/>2.1 Case r even <lb/>We start by proving the following result. <lb/>Proposition 2.4. Assume r even, n &gt; r, and d r ≤ 0. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, +∞), where 𝜌 -≥ 0 is the only solution of nH r I n,r (𝜌) + <lb/>d r = 0. <lb/></body>

        <body>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 -is as above, and 𝜌 + &gt; 0 is the only solution of <lb/>sinh n-r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) = 0. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H r ,d r is increasing and convex in the interior of its domain. Also, 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0 = lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌). In <lb/>case (1), 𝜆 H r ,d r is unbounded. In case (2) lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. In both cases, d r = 0 if and only if 𝜌 -= 0. We <lb/>have lim 𝜌→0 λH r ,0 (𝜌) = H r <lb/>1∕r , and for d r &lt; 0 one finds lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞ (Figure 1). <lb/>Figure 1: Behavior of 𝜆 H r ,d r for n &gt; r, r even, and d r ≤ 0. Note that 𝜌 -= 0 if and only if d r = 0. <lb/>Proof. The function nH r I n,r + d r must be non-negative as noted in Remark 2.2, hence 𝜆 H r ,d r is well-defined when <lb/>0 ≤ nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜌). <lb/>There is a unique value 𝜌 -≥ 0 depending on d r such that nH r I n,r (𝜌 -) + d r = 0, and Remark 2.3 implies <lb/>d r = 0 if and only if 𝜌 -= 0. Set <lb/>f (𝜌) := sinh n-r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ), <lb/>𝜌≥ 0. <lb/>Then f (𝜌 -) ≥ 0 and f ′ (𝜌) = sinh n-r-1 (𝜌)cosh(𝜌)((n -r) -nH r tanh r (𝜌)). We have f ′ (𝜌) &gt; 0 for 𝜌 &gt; 𝜌 -when <lb/>tanh r (𝜌) &lt; (n -r)∕nH r . So if 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n the inequality is always true, and f has no zeros in (𝜌 -, +∞). <lb/>If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n then lim 𝜌→+∞ f ′ (𝜌) = -∞, so f eventually decreases to -∞. This implies f has a zero 𝜌 + &gt; 𝜌 -<lb/>depending on the value of d r . <lb/>It follows that 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on some interval with 𝜌 -as minimum. If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n then the interval <lb/>is unbounded. We have 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0 = lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌), and lim 𝜌→+∞ 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞ by the asymptotic behav-<lb/>ior of I n,r noted in Remark 2.3. Moreover, 𝜆 H r ,d r is increasing as the integrand function is positive away from 𝜌 -. If <lb/>H r &gt; (n -r)∕n then the denominator of the integrand function has a zero 𝜌 + depending on d r . This means 𝜆 H r ,d r <lb/>is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), and its slope tends to +∞ when 𝜌 → 𝜌 + . We claim that 𝜆 H r ,d r is finite at 𝜌 + . Convergence <lb/>of the integral is essentially determined by the behavior of <lb/>h(𝜌) := sinh <lb/>n-r <lb/>r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>near 𝜌 + . But h(𝜌 + ) = 0, and h ′ (𝜌 + ) is finite, which implies that 𝜆 H r ,d r behaves as the integral of 1∕(𝜌 + -𝜌) 1∕2 for <lb/>𝜌 close to 𝜌 + , whence convergence at 𝜌 + . <lb/>In order to check convexity on (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), observe that the sign of λH r ,d r as in (5) is determined by the sign of <lb/>g(𝜌) := <lb/>sinh n (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r (𝜌) <lb/>-(n -r)I n,r (𝜌) -<lb/>d r (n -r) <lb/>nH r <lb/>. <lb/>We trivially have g(𝜌 -) ≥ 0 and g ′ (𝜌) = rsinh n-1 (𝜌)∕cosh r+1 (𝜌) &gt; 0, so that g(𝜌) is always positive for 𝜌 &gt; 0. <lb/>Continuity of the second derivative of 𝜆 H r ,d r at the origin for d r = 0 follows by an explicit calculation using <lb/>Remark 2.3, whereas the statement lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = ∞ for d r &lt; 0 is trivial, cf. (5). <lb/>□ <lb/>We now go on with the analysis of the case d r &gt; 0, but we first make a few technical considerations. For <lb/>r &gt; 2 we have the following formula, which can be proved via integration by parts: <lb/>I r+1,r (x) = -<lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>(r -2) cosh r-2 (x) <lb/>+ <lb/>r -1 <lb/>r -2 <lb/>I r-1,r-2 (x). <lb/>(6) <lb/></body>

        <body>Recall that for a natural number m the double factorial is m!! := m(m -2)!!, and 1!! = 0!! = 1. Now take <lb/>r &gt; 2 even. From the recurrence relation (6) we derive the following closed expression for I r+1,r (x): <lb/>I r+1,r (x) = -sinh(x) <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>r -2 <lb/>tanh r-2 (x) + <lb/>r -1 <lb/>(r -2)(r -4) <lb/>tanh r-4 (x) <lb/>+ <lb/>(r -1)(r -3) <lb/>(r -2)(r -4)(r -6) <lb/>tanh r-6 (x) + • • • + <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>3(r -2)‼ <lb/>tanh 2 (x) <lb/>) <lb/>+ <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>I 3,2 (x). <lb/>(7) <lb/>The explicit expression I 3,2 (x) = sinh(x) -arctan(sinh(x)) returns now a closed formula for each I r+1,r (x). <lb/>We note here a useful identity which can be proved by induction. <lb/>Lemma 2.5. Let r ≥ 2 be an even natural number. Then <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>= 1 + <lb/>1 <lb/>r -2 <lb/>+ <lb/>r -1 <lb/>(r -2)(r -4) <lb/>+ <lb/>(r -1)(r -3) <lb/>(r -2)(r -4)(r -6) <lb/>+ + • • • + <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>3(r -2)‼ <lb/>, <lb/>where, for all r, the sum on the right-hand side must be truncated in such a way that all summands exist. <lb/>We shall see that when d r &gt; 0 then 𝜆 H r ,d r is not well-defined for d r too large. We will combine (7) and <lb/>Lemma 2.5 to give a precise upper bound for d r when n = r + 1 and H r = (n -r)∕n = 1∕(r + 1). <lb/>Proposition 2.6. Assume r even, n &gt; r, and d r &gt; 0. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r &lt; (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, +∞), where 𝜌 -&gt; 0 is the only solution of sinh n-r (𝜌) -<lb/>(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) = 0 on (0, ∞). <lb/>(2) If H r = (n -r)∕n, then when n = r + 1 we need d r &lt; (r -1)!!𝜋∕2(r -2)!! for 𝜆 H r ,d r to be well-defined, <lb/>whereas for n &gt; r + 1 we have no constraint. Under such conditions, the results in the previous point hold. <lb/>(3) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, set 𝜏 &gt; 0 such that tanh r (𝜏) = (n -r)∕nH r . Then d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜏) -nH r I n,r (𝜏) for 𝜆 H r ,d r <lb/>to be defined. So 𝜆 H r ,d r is a function on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ] ⊂ (0, +∞), where sinh n-r (𝜌 ± ) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌 ± ) + d r ) = 0. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H r ,d r is increasing in the interior of its domain. In cases (1)-(2), 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞, <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r is unbounded, and is concave in the interior of its domain. In case (3), 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, lim 𝜌→𝜌 ± λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞, <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r has a unique inflection point in (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), and goes from being concave to convex (Figure 2). <lb/>Figure 2: Behavior of 𝜆 H r ,d r for n &gt; r, r even, and d r &gt; 0. <lb/>Proof. We have the constraint 0 ≤ nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜌) for 𝜌 &gt; 0. Since I n,r (0) = 0 and d r &gt; 0 we must <lb/>have 𝜌 -&gt; 0. Such a 𝜌 -exists only if <lb/>f (𝜌) := sinh n-r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) <lb/>has a zero. We have f (0) &lt; 0 and <lb/>f ′ (𝜌) = sinh n-r-1 (𝜌) cosh(𝜌) <lb/>( <lb/>(n -r) -nH r tanh r (𝜌) <lb/>) <lb/>. <lb/>For 0 &lt; H r &lt; (n -r)∕n the derivative f ′ is always positive and tends to +∞ as 𝜌 runs to ∞, so 𝜌 -exists <lb/>and 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, +∞). For H r = (n -r)∕n we have a more subtle behavior. We compute <lb/>1 <lb/>n -r <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→∞ <lb/>f ′ (𝜌) = lim <lb/>𝜌→∞ <lb/>sinh n-r-1 (𝜌) cosh(𝜌)(1 -tanh r (𝜌)) <lb/></body>

        <body>= lim <lb/>𝜌→∞ <lb/>sinh n-r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r (𝜌) -sinh r (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>= lim <lb/>𝜌→∞ <lb/>sinh n-r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>(cosh(𝜌) -sinh(𝜌)) <lb/>r-1 <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=0 <lb/>cosh r-1-i (𝜌) sinh i (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>= lim <lb/>𝜌→∞ <lb/>sinh n-r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>cosh(𝜌) + sinh(𝜌) <lb/>r-1 <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=0 <lb/>tanh i (𝜌). <lb/>When n = r + 2 the limit of f ′ is r, and if n &gt; r + 2 the limit is +∞. In these two cases 𝜌 -exists and 𝜆 H r ,d r <lb/>is defined on [𝜌 -, ∞). The case n = r + 1 needs to be studied separately, as the limit vanishes. The claim is that <lb/>for any r even we have that 𝜌 -exists only if <lb/>d r &lt; <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>𝜋 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>Indeed, when r = 2 we compute <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→+∞ <lb/>sinh(𝜌) -<lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>sinh 2 (𝜎) <lb/>cosh(𝜎) <lb/>d𝜎 -d 2 = lim <lb/>𝜌→+∞ <lb/>(arctan(sinh(𝜌)) -d 2 ) = <lb/>𝜋 <lb/>2 <lb/>-d 2 . <lb/>In this case, f cannot have a zero if d 2 ≥ 𝜋∕2. To prove the above claim for r ≥ 4, we use (7) and find <lb/>f (𝜌) = sinh(𝜌) -I r+1,r (𝜌) -d r <lb/>= sinh(𝜌) <lb/>( <lb/>1 + <lb/>1 <lb/>r -2 <lb/>tanh r-2 (𝜌) + <lb/>r -1 <lb/>(r -2)(r -4) <lb/>tanh r-4 (𝜌) <lb/>+ • • • + <lb/>(r -1)(r -3) • • • 5 <lb/>(r -2)(r -4) • • • 2 <lb/>tanh 2 (𝜌) -<lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>) <lb/>+ <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>arctan(sinh(𝜌)) -d r . <lb/>Now Lemma 2.5 implies that when 𝜌 → +∞ the sum of the terms into brackets goes to zero, and the product <lb/>of sinh(𝜌) with the latter vanishes (one can use the estimates sinh(𝜌) ≈ e 𝜌 ∕2 and tanh(𝜌) ≈ 1 -2e -2𝜌 for 𝜌 → +∞ <lb/>to see this). Hence <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→+∞ <lb/>f (𝜌) = <lb/>(r -1)‼ <lb/>(r -2)‼ <lb/>𝜋 <lb/>2 <lb/>-d r , <lb/>and the claim is proved. Convergence of 𝜆 H r ,d r at 𝜌 -follows by a similar argument as in the proof of <lb/>Proposition 2.4. <lb/>If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n there is a 𝜏 &gt; 0 such that f is increasing on (0, 𝜏) and decreasing on (𝜏, +∞). Such a <lb/>𝜏 satisfies tanh r (𝜏) = (n -r)∕nH r . In order to have a well-defined 𝜆 H r ,d r , we necessarily want f (𝜏) &gt; 0, which <lb/>forces the condition <lb/>d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜏) -nH r I n,r (𝜏). <lb/>Since f ′ (𝜌 -) &gt; 0, f ′ (𝜌 + ) &lt; 0, then f vanishes at 𝜌 -and 𝜌 + with order 1. This gives convergence of 𝜆 H r ,d r at <lb/>the boundary points. We have 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0, and lim 𝜌→𝜌 ± λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞ at once. <lb/>We finally discuss convexity of 𝜆 H r ,d r by proceeding as in the case d r ≤ 0. The sign of the second derivative <lb/>is determined by the sign of <lb/>g(𝜌) := <lb/>sinh n (𝜌) <lb/>cosh r (𝜌) <lb/>-(n -r)I n,r (𝜌) -<lb/>d r (n -r) <lb/>nH r <lb/>. <lb/>By definition of 𝜌 -, the sign of g(𝜌 -) is determined by the sign of tanh r (𝜌 -) -(n -r)∕nH r . When nH r &gt; <lb/>n -r, then the above quantity is negative as <lb/></body>

        <body>tanh r (𝜌 -) -<lb/>n -r <lb/>nH r <lb/>= tanh r (𝜌 -) -tanh r (𝜏). <lb/>Similarly, g(𝜌 + ) &gt; 0. Since g ′ (𝜌) &gt; 0, 𝜆 H r ,d r has a unique inflection point, and goes from being concave <lb/>to convex. If nH r ≤ n -r, we have lim 𝜌→+∞ g(𝜌) = -d r (n -r)∕nH r &lt; 0 by Remark 2.3. But g is an increasing <lb/>function, so it is always negative, and hence 𝜆 H r ,d r is concave. <lb/>□ <lb/>There remains to look at the case n = r. Set I n (𝜌) := I n,n (𝜌) = ∫ <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>0 tanh n-1 (𝜏) d𝜏. <lb/>Proposition 2.7. Assume n = r even. Then 𝜆 H n ,d n is well-defined for d n &lt; 1. <lb/>(1) If d n &lt; 0, then 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 -is the only solution of nH n I n (𝜌) + d n = 0, and 𝜌 + is the <lb/>only solution of nH n I n (𝜌) + d n = 1. <lb/>(2) If 0 ≤ d n &lt; 1, then 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined on [0, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 + is defined as above. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H n ,d n is increasing and convex in the interior of its domain. In case (1), 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 -) = 0 = λH n ,d n (𝜌 -), <lb/>and lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH n ,d n (𝜌) = +∞. In case (2), 𝜆 H n ,d n (0) = 0, λH n ,d n (𝜌 -) = d 1∕n <lb/>n ∕ <lb/>( <lb/>1 -d 2∕n <lb/>n <lb/>) 1∕2 <lb/>, and lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH n ,d n (𝜌) = <lb/>+∞. In the particular case d n = 0, we also have lim 𝜌→0 λH n ,0 (𝜌) = H n <lb/>1∕n , and if d n &lt; 0 then lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌 -) = <lb/>+∞ (Figure 3). <lb/>Figure 3: Behavior of 𝜆 H n ,d n for n even and H n &gt; 0. When d n is non-negative, we distinguish two cases, i.e. d n = 0 (red), and 0 &lt; d n &lt; 1 <lb/>(blue). <lb/>Proof. Our usual constraint becomes <lb/>0 ≤ nH n I n (𝜌) + d n &lt; 1. <lb/>Hence necessarily d n &lt; 1. If d n &lt; 0 there are positive numbers 𝜌 -, 𝜌 + such that nH n I n (𝜌 -) + d n = 0 and <lb/>nH n I n (𝜌 + ) + d n = 1, and 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ). Clearly λH n ,d n (𝜌 -) = 0. If 0 ≤ d n &lt; 1, then 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined <lb/>on [0, 𝜌 + ). We have λH n ,d n (0) = d 1∕n <lb/>n ∕ <lb/>( <lb/>1 -d 2∕n <lb/>n <lb/>) 1∕2 <lb/>. The same method as in the proof of Proposition 2.4 shows <lb/>that in both cases 𝜆 H n ,d n is finite at 𝜌 + . The expression of λH r ,d r in (5) for n = r implies convexity of the graphs <lb/>at once. Continuity of the second derivative at the origin for d n = 0 follows by an explicit calculation, cf. (5) and <lb/>Remark 2.3. <lb/>□ <lb/>We now study the regularity of the H r -hypersurface generated by rotating the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , as described <lb/>at the beginning of Section 2. Then we will proceed with the classification result. <lb/>Proposition 2.8. Let n ≥ r, r even. Then the hypersurface generated by the curve defined by 𝜆 H r ,d r is of class C 2 at <lb/>𝜌 = 𝜌 + , when the latter exists, and it is of class C 2 at 𝜌 = 𝜌 -if and only if n &gt; r and d r ≥ 0 or n = r and d n = 0. <lb/>When n = r and d n &gt; 0, it has a conical singularity at 𝜌 = 0. If n ≥ r and d r &lt; 0, it has cuspidal singularities at <lb/>𝜌 = 𝜌 -. <lb/>Proof. Regularity to second order of the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r is proved by showing that <lb/>the second fundamental form A is bounded. <lb/>For any choice of n ≥ r, H r and d r for which 𝜌 + exists, we have that 𝜌 + &gt; 0 and lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. By <lb/>(1), for any i = 1, … , n -1 we have that <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→𝜌 + <lb/>k i (𝜌) = cotgh(𝜌 + ). <lb/></body>

        <body>By definition of 𝜌 + , combining (1) and (5) one finds <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→𝜌 + <lb/>k n (𝜌) = <lb/>cotgh(𝜌 + ) <lb/>r <lb/>(nH r tanh(𝜌 + ) -(n -r)). <lb/>It follows that lim 𝜌→𝜌 + |A| 2 (𝜌) exists and is finite. <lb/>Assume now that n &gt; r and d r &gt; 0, then 𝜌 -&gt; 0 and lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. Therefore lim 𝜌→𝜌 -|A| 2 (𝜌) exists <lb/>and is finite by arguing as above. <lb/>When d r = 0 we have 𝜌 -= 0. By Remark 2.3, (1) and (5), as 𝜌 → 0 we get the estimates <lb/>cotgh(𝜌) ≈ 𝜌 -1 , <lb/>λH r ,d r (𝜌) ≈ H <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>r 𝜌, <lb/>λH r ,d r (𝜌) ≈ H <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>r . <lb/>For any i = 1, … , n it follows that <lb/>lim <lb/>𝜌→0 <lb/>k i (𝜌) = H <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>r , <lb/>and lim 𝜌→0 |A| 2 (𝜌) exists and is finite in this case as well. <lb/>In the case n ≥ r and d r &lt; 0 we have 𝜌 -&gt; 0, λH r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, but lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. Hence |A| 2 blows <lb/>up at 𝜌 -because lim 𝜌→𝜌 -k n (𝜌) = +∞. Moreover, it is clear that by reflecting the hypersurface generated by the <lb/>graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r across the slice ℍ n × {0} one gets cuspidal singularities along the intersection with ℍ n × {0}. <lb/>Finally, when n = r and 0 &lt; d n &lt; 1, by Proposition 2.7 we have that 𝜌 -= 0 and <lb/>λH n ,d n (0) = <lb/>d <lb/>1 <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>( <lb/>1 -d <lb/>2 <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>) 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>&gt; 0. <lb/>So the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H n ,d n has a conical singularity in 𝜌 = 0. <lb/>□ <lb/>We now classify rotational H r -hypersurfaces for r even based on the above arguments. We recover results <lb/>by Elbert-Sa Earp [21, Section 6] and de Lima-Manfio-dos Santos [22, Theorem 1 and 2]. We recall that a slice <lb/>is any subspace ℍ n × {t} ⊂ ℍ n × ℝ, and by its origin we mean its intersection with the t-axis. <lb/>Theorem 2.9. Assume r even, n &gt; r, and d r &lt; 0. By reflecting the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r across suitable slices, we get a non-compact embedded H r -hypersurface. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r together with its reflection across <lb/>the slice ℍ n × {0} is a singular annulus. Its singular set is made of cuspidal points along a sphere of radius <lb/>𝜌 -centered at the origin of the slice ℍ n × {0}. <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, then the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , together with its reflections across <lb/>the slices ℍ n × {k𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + )}, k ∈ ℤ, gives a singular onduloid. Its singular set is made of cuspidal points <lb/>along spheres of radius 𝜌 -centered at the origin of the slices ℍ n × {2k𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + )}, k ∈ ℤ. <lb/>Theorem 2.10. Assume r even, n &gt; r, and d r = 0. Then the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 is <lb/>a complete embedded H r -hypersurface, possibly after reflection across a suitable slice. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 is an entire graph of class C 2 tangent <lb/>to the slice ℍ n × {0} at the origin. <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 , together with its reflection across the <lb/>slice ℍ n × {𝜆 H r ,0 (𝜌 + )}, is a class C 2 sphere. <lb/>Theorem 2.11. Assume r even, n &gt; r, and d r &gt; 0. By reflecting the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r across suitable slices, we get a complete non-compact embedded H r -hypersurface. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , together with its reflection across <lb/>the slice ℍ n × {0}, is a class C 2 annulus. When n = r + 1 and H r = 1∕(r + 1), the same holds, provided that <lb/>d r is smaller than (r -1)!!𝜋∕2(r -2)!!. <lb/></body>

        <body>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r together with its reflections across the <lb/>slices ℍ n × {k𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + )}, k ∈ ℤ, is a class C 2 onduloid. <lb/>Theorem 2.12. Assume n = r even and H n &gt; 0. Then the H n -hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H n ,d n , <lb/>together with its reflection across the slice ℍ n × {𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + )}, is a class C 2 sphere if d n = 0, and a peaked sphere if <lb/>0 &lt; d n &lt; 1. If d n &lt; 0 then the H n -hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H n ,d n , together with its reflections across <lb/>the slices ℍ n × {k𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + )}, k ∈ ℤ, gives a singular onduloid. Its singular set is made of cuspidal points along <lb/>spheres of radius 𝜌 -centered at the origin of the slices ℍ n × {2k𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + )}, k ∈ ℤ. <lb/>2.2 Case r odd <lb/>We organize this subsection in a similar fashion as the previous one. Some of the arguments will be analogous <lb/>to the corresponding ones for r even, so we leave out the relative details. Note that this subsection includes and <lb/>extends the mean curvature case treated in [23] and [27]. A crucial difference from the case r even is that for <lb/>d r &lt; 0 the derivative λH r ,d r is negative on some subset of the domain of 𝜆 H r ,d r , and for r &gt; 1 the function 𝜆 H r ,d r is <lb/>not C 2 -regular at its minimum point. Further, more types of curves arise when n &gt; r and d r &lt; 0, and when n = r. <lb/>In our classification, we will recover results by Bérard-Sa Earp [23, Section 2], Elbert-Sa Earp [21, Section 6], <lb/>and de Lima-Manfio-dos Santos [22, Theorem 1 and 2]. <lb/>Proposition 2.13. Assume r odd, n &gt; r, and d r &lt; 0. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, +∞), where 𝜌 -&gt; 0 is the only solution of sinh n-r (𝜌) + <lb/>(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) = 0. <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,d r is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 -is as above, and 𝜌 + &gt; 0 is the only solution of <lb/>sinh n-r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) = 0. <lb/>Set 𝜌 0 to be the only zero of nH r I n,r + d r . We have 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = -∞, λH r ,d r (𝜌) &lt; 0 when 𝜌 -&lt; <lb/>𝜌 &lt; 𝜌 0 , and λH r ,d r (𝜌) &gt; 0 when 𝜌 &gt; 𝜌 0 . In case (1), lim 𝜌→+∞ 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. In case (2), lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H r ,d r is convex in the interior of its domain. In particular, it is of class C 2 for r = 1, and lim 𝜌→𝜌 0 λH r ,d r (𝜌) = <lb/>+∞ for r &gt; 1 (Figure 4). <lb/>Figure 4: Behavior of 𝜆 H r ,d r for n &gt; r, r odd, and d r &lt; 0. For H 1 &gt; (n -1)∕n, 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) is positive. When r ≥ 3, 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) may be positive <lb/>(black curve), negative (red curve), or zero (blue curve) depending on the values of H r and d r . <lb/>Proof. Our constraint for 𝜆 H r ,d r to be well-defined is now <lb/>-sinh n-r (𝜌) &lt; nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜌), <lb/>𝜌&gt;0. <lb/>(8) <lb/>We know that nH r I n,r + d r is an increasing function with d r &lt; 0 and I n,r (0) = 0, so that nH r I n,r (0) + d r &lt; 0. <lb/>The first inequality in (8) is then always satisfied for 𝜌 &gt; 𝜌 -&gt; 0, where 𝜌 -is the unique solution of nH r I n,r (𝜌) + <lb/>d r + sinh n-r (𝜌) = 0. It is clear that 𝜌 -→ 0 if and only if d r → 0. The study of the second inequality goes along <lb/>the lines of the corresponding one for r even (Proposition 2.4). Note that lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = -∞ regardless of <lb/>the value of H r . Also, 𝜆 H r ,d r is decreasing on (𝜌 -, 𝜌 0 ), where 𝜌 0 is the only zero of nH r I n,r + d r , then it increases <lb/>beyond 𝜌 0 . Convergence at 𝜌 -or 𝜌 + and the statements involving the second derivative follow by (5) and similar <lb/>arguments as in the proof of Proposition 2.4. We point out that for r = 1 the term (nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) (r-1)∕r equals 1, <lb/>so the second derivative of 𝜆 H r ,d r is well-defined over the interior of the whole domain.

        <body>Unlike the case when r is even, the sign of 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ), for H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, r &gt; 1 odd, is not always positive. <lb/>We discuss this point here below. Moreover we show that 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) only takes positive values. <lb/>Proposition 2.14. The following statements hold. <lb/>(1) If H 1 &gt; (n -1)∕n, then 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0 for all d 1 &lt; 0. <lb/>(2) Let 2r -1 &gt; n &gt; r ≥ 3, and r odd. Then there exist values H r &gt; (n -r)∕n and d r &lt; 0 such that 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) is <lb/>negative, positive, or zero. <lb/>Proof. In case (1), it is well known that the rotational hypersurface generated by the curve defined by 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 is <lb/>of class C 2 . We show (1) by using Alexandrov reflection method with respect to vertical hyperplanes in ℍ n × ℝ. <lb/>Let H 1 &gt; (n -1)∕n be fixed. Since the function defining 𝜆 H 1 ,0 is non-negative and does not vanish, and 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 <lb/>is continuous in d 1 , then for d 1 &lt; 0 close enough to 0 we have 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0. Suppose there is a value of the <lb/>parameter d 1 for which 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) vanishes. Consider the rotational hypersurface S obtained after reflecting the <lb/>graph of 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 across the 𝜌-axis, and then rotating about the t-axis. Topologically S is a product S 1 × S n-1 , and is of <lb/>class C 2 . Since S is compact, we can take a vertical hyperplane Π ⊂ ℍ n × ℝ corresponding to 𝜌 &gt; 0 large enough <lb/>not intersecting S, and then move it towards S until Π ∩ S ≠ ∅. We keep moving Π in the same way and reflect <lb/>the portion of S left behind Π across Π. Since 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 -) = 0, there will be a first intersection point between <lb/>the reflected part of S and S itself. The Maximum Principle then implies that S has a symmetry with respect to <lb/>a vertical hyperplane corresponding to some 𝜌 ∈ (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ). But this is a contradiction, as the hypersurface has <lb/>rotational symmetry about t = 0. Continuity of 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 with respect to the parameters implies that there cannot <lb/>be values of d 1 such that 𝜆 H 1 ,d 1 (𝜌 + ) is negative. <lb/>As for (2), observe that for H r &gt; (n -r)∕n we have 𝜆 H r ,0 (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0, because the integrand function defining <lb/>𝜆 H r ,0 is non-negative and does not vanish identically. Continuity with respect to the parameter d r implies that <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0 for d r &lt; 0 close enough to 0. We now show that 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) &lt; 0 for some H r &gt; (n -r)∕n and d r &lt; 0. <lb/>Let us introduce the function <lb/>g(𝜌) := <lb/>nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r <lb/>sinh n-r (𝜌) <lb/>, <lb/>and note that we can rewrite 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) as <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) = <lb/>𝜌 + <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜌 -<lb/>g(𝜉) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -g(𝜉) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>d𝜉. <lb/>We claim that, for any d r &lt; 0 and 2r -n -1 &gt; 0, if H r is large enough then g is convex on (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ). So let <lb/>d r &lt; 0 be fixed. By definition of 𝜌 ± we have <lb/>H r = <lb/>|d r | ± sinh n-r (𝜌 ± ) <lb/>nI n,r (𝜌 ± ) <lb/>. <lb/>Observe that 𝜌 ± → 0 if and only if H r → ∞ and 𝜌 ± ≈ |d r | <lb/>1 <lb/>n H r <lb/>-1 <lb/>n as H r → ∞. Therefore for any 𝜌 ∈ (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ) <lb/>we estimate <lb/>𝜌 ≈ <lb/>( <lb/>|d r | <lb/>H r <lb/>) 1 <lb/>n <lb/>, H r → ∞. <lb/>(9) <lb/>Since -sinh n-r (𝜌) &lt; nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜌) holds on (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), (9) and explicit computations give that <lb/>for any 𝜌 ∈ (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ) we have <lb/>g ′′ (𝜌) = nH r <lb/>( <lb/>sinh(𝜌) <lb/>cosh(𝜌) <lb/>) r-2 ( <lb/>r -1 <lb/>cosh 2 (𝜌) <lb/>-(n -r) <lb/>) <lb/>+ <lb/>nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r <lb/>sinh n-r+2 (𝜌) <lb/>((n -r) sinh 2 (𝜌) + n -r + 1) <lb/>&gt; nH r <lb/>( <lb/>sinh(𝜌) <lb/>cosh(𝜌) <lb/>) r-2 ( <lb/>r -1 <lb/>cosh 2 (𝜌) <lb/>-(n -r) <lb/>) <lb/>-<lb/>(n -r) sinh 2 (𝜌) + n -r + 1 <lb/>sinh 2 (𝜌) <lb/>≈ H <lb/>2 <lb/>n <lb/>r <lb/>( <lb/>(2r -1 -n)|d r | <lb/>r-2 <lb/>n H r <lb/>n-r <lb/>n -(n -r + 1)|d r | -2 <lb/>n <lb/>) <lb/>-(n -r). <lb/></body>

        <body>When H r → ∞ the latter quantity diverges to +∞ if 2r -1 -n &gt; 0, hence g ′′ &gt; 0 on (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ). Fix H r large <lb/>enough such that g is convex in (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ). Since g(𝜌 ± ) = ±1, then g(𝜌) &lt; s(𝜌) for any 𝜌 ∈ (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), where s is the <lb/>segment-line connecting (𝜌 -, -1) with (𝜌 + , 1). Moreover the function x ↦ x 1∕r ∕ <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -x 2∕r is increasing on (-1, 1). <lb/>For such a choice of H r and d r we then have <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) &lt; <lb/>𝜌 + <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜌 -<lb/>s(𝜉) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -s(𝜉) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>d𝜉 = <lb/>𝜌 + -𝜌 -<lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>∫ <lb/>-1 <lb/>u <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -u <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>du = 0, <lb/>as the latter integrand function is odd. <lb/>Continuity of 𝜆 H r ,d r with respect to the parameters H r and d r implies the last assertion of (2) at once. <lb/>□ <lb/>The proof of the next statement is left out, because the results can be seen by adapting the proof of <lb/>Proposition 2.4 when d r = 0. <lb/>Proposition 2.15. Assume r odd, n &gt; r, and d r = 0. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,0 is defined on [0, +∞). <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, then 𝜆 H r ,0 is defined on [0, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 + &gt; 0 is the only solution of sinh n-r (𝜌) -<lb/>nH r I n,r (𝜌) = 0. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H r ,0 is increasing and convex in the interior of its domain. We have 𝜆 H r ,0 (0) = 0 = lim 𝜌→0 λH r ,0 (𝜌). In case <lb/>(1), 𝜆 H r ,0 is unbounded. In case (2), lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH r ,0 (𝜌) = +∞. Finally, lim t→0 λH r ,0 (𝜌) = H r <lb/>1∕r (Figure 5). <lb/>Figure 5: Behavior of 𝜆 H r ,0 for n &gt; r and r odd. <lb/>In order to prove the next result, one needs the analogue of formula (7) and Lemma 2.5 for r odd.

        <body>(3) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, set 𝜏 &gt; 0 such that tanh r (𝜏) = (n -r)∕nH r . Then d r &lt; sinh n-r (𝜏) -nH r I n,r (𝜏), for 𝜆 H r ,d r <lb/>to be defined. So 𝜆 H r ,d r is a function on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ] ⊂ (0, +∞), where sinh n-r (𝜌 ± ) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌 ± ) + d r ) = 0. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H r ,d r is increasing in the interior of its domain. In cases (1)-(2), 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, lim 𝜌→𝜌 -λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞, <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r is unbounded, and is concave in the interior of its domain. In case (3), 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 -) = 0, lim 𝜌→𝜌 ± λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞, <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r has a unique inflection point in (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), and goes from being concave to convex (Figure 6). <lb/>Figure 6: Behavior of 𝜆 H r ,d r for n &gt; r, r odd, and d r &gt; 0. <lb/>Proposition 2.18. Assume n = r odd. Then 𝜆 H n ,d n is well-defined for d n &lt; 1. Set I n := I n,n . <lb/>(1) If d n &lt; -1, then 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined on [𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 -is the only solution of nH n I n (𝜌) + d n = -1, and 𝜌 + is <lb/>the only solution of nH n I n (𝜌) + d n = 1. <lb/>(2) If -1 ≤ d n &lt; 1, then 𝜆 H n ,d n is defined on [0, 𝜌 + ], where 𝜌 + is defined as above. <lb/>Further, 𝜆 H n ,d n is convex in the interior of its domain. Set 𝜌 0 to be the only solution of nH n I n (𝜌) + d n = 0. In <lb/>case (1), we have 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 -) = 0, λH n ,d n (𝜌) &lt; 0 for 𝜌 -&lt; 𝜌 &lt; 𝜌 0 , λH n ,d n (𝜌) &gt; 0 for 𝜌 &gt; 𝜌 0 , 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) &lt; 0, and <lb/>lim 𝜌→𝜌 + λH n ,d n (𝜌) = +∞. In case (2), one finds λH n ,d n (0) = d 1∕n <lb/>n ∕ <lb/>( <lb/>1 -d 2∕n <lb/>n <lb/>) 1∕2 <lb/>, and lim d n →-1 λH n ,d n (0) = -∞. For <lb/>d n &lt; 0 the function 𝜆 H n ,d n first decreases then increases, and the sign of 𝜆 H n ,d n depends on the value of d n , <lb/>whereas for d n ≥ 0 the function 𝜆 H n ,d n is increasing on the whole domain. Moreover, lim 𝜌→0 λH n ,0 (𝜌) = H n <lb/>1∕n , and <lb/>lim 𝜌→𝜌 0 λH n ,d n (𝜌) = +∞ (Figure 7). <lb/>Figure 7: Behavior of 𝜆 H n ,d n for n odd and H n &gt; 0. When -1 ≤ d n &lt; 1, we distinguish four cases, i.e. d n = -1 (black), -1 &lt; d n &lt; 0 (red), <lb/>d n = 0 (violet), 0 &lt; d n &lt; 1 (orange). The blue curve corresponds to a value of d n ∈ (-1, 0) for which 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) vanishes. <lb/>Proof. The only part of the proof differing from the proof of Proposition 2.7 is about the sign of 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ). We look <lb/>first at the case d n &lt; -1. Since nH n I n + d n is convex, nH n I n (𝜌) + d n &lt; s(𝜌), where s is the line passing through <lb/>the points (𝜌 -, -1) and (𝜌 + , 1). Now nH n I n (𝜌) + d n &lt; s(𝜌) for 𝜌 ∈ (𝜌 -, 𝜌 + ), so we also have <lb/>(nH n I n (𝜌) + d n ) <lb/>1 <lb/>n <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -(nH n I n (𝜌) + d n ) <lb/>2 <lb/>n <lb/>&lt; <lb/>s(𝜌) <lb/>1 <lb/>n <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -s(𝜌) <lb/>2 <lb/>n <lb/>, <lb/>as the function x ↦ x 1∕n ∕ <lb/>√ <lb/>1 -x 2∕n is increasing.

        <body>This shows 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) &lt; 0. The same holds when d n = -1, the only difference being that 𝜌 -= 0. Since <lb/>𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) depends continuously on d n , and for d n ≥ 0 we have 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) &gt; 0, there must be a d n ∈ (-1, 0) such <lb/>that 𝜆 H n ,d n (𝜌 + ) = 0. <lb/>□ <lb/>As in the case of r even (cf. Proposition 2.8), before proceeding with the classification result, we study the <lb/>regularity of the H r -hypersurface generated by a rotation of the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r . <lb/>Proposition 2.19. Let n ≥ r, r odd. Then the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r is of class C 2 at 𝜌 = 𝜌 + , <lb/>when the latter exists, and it is of class C 2 at 𝜌 = 𝜌 -if and only if n &gt; r, or n = r and d n ∈ (-∞, -1) ∪ {0}. <lb/>When n = r and d r ∈ [-1, 0) ∪ (0, 1), there is a conical singularity at 𝜌 = 0. Moreover, if r ≥ 3 and d r ≠ 0, the <lb/>hypersurface is C 2 -singular at any critical point of the function 𝜆 H r ,d r . <lb/>Proof. The first part of the proof is an application of the same argument as in Proposition 2.8. If r = 1 it is well <lb/>known that the corresponding hypersurface is smooth. Now let r ≥ 3 and let 𝜌 0 be a critical point of 𝜆 H r ,d r . <lb/>By (4) we have that nH r I n,r (𝜌 0 ) + d r = 0. By (5) it follows that lim 𝜌→𝜌 0 λH r ,d r (𝜌) = +∞. Using (1) we can see that <lb/>lim 𝜌→𝜌 0 k n (𝜌) = +∞, hence |A| 2 blows up near 𝜌 0 . <lb/>□ <lb/>Remark 2.20. The same kind of singularities appears in the construction of rotationally invariant higher order <lb/>translators, i.e. hypersurfaces with H r = g(𝜈, 𝜕∕𝜕t), where r &gt; 1 and 𝜈 is the unit normal, see [28]. <lb/>We now proceed with the classification results. We recover results by Bérard-Sa Earp [23], Elbert-Sa Earp <lb/>[21, Section 6] and de Lima-Manfio-dos Santos [22, Theorem 1 and 2]. Recall that a slice is any subspace ℍ n × <lb/>{t} ⊂ ℍ n × ℝ, and its origin was defined as its intersection with the t-axis. <lb/>Theorem 2.21. Assume r odd, n &gt; r, and d r &lt; 0. By reflecting the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r across suitable slices, we get an immersed H r -hypersurface. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , together with its reflection across <lb/>the slice ℍ n × {0}, is an annulus with self-intersections along a sphere centered at the origin of the slice <lb/>ℍ n × {0}. The hypersurface is of class C 2 for r = 1, and of class C 1 for r ≥ 3. In the latter case, the singular <lb/>set consists of two spheres of radius 𝜌 0 contained in the slices ℍ n × {±𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 0 )} and centered at their origin. <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, then we distinguish two subcases. If r = 1, the hypersurface generated by the graph of <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r , together with its reflection across the slice ℍ n × {0} and vertical translations of integral multiples <lb/>of 2𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ), is a C 2 nodoid with self-intersections along infinitely many spheres centered at the origin of <lb/>distinct slices. If r ≥ 3, we have two possibilities. First, one may get nodoids as in the r = 1 case, except that <lb/>they are not C 2 -regular (singularities appear along infinitely many spheres of radius 𝜌 0 in distinct slices). <lb/>Second, one may get compact hypersurfaces with the topology of S 1 × S n-1 with C 2 singularities along two <lb/>spheres of radius 𝜌 0 contained in the slices ℍ n × {±𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 0 )} and centered at their origin. <lb/>Theorem 2.22. Assume r odd, n &gt; r, and d r = 0. Then the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 is a <lb/>complete embedded H r -hypersurface, possibly after reflection across a suitable slice. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 is an entire graph of class C 2 tangent <lb/>to the slice ℍ n × {0} at the origin. <lb/>(2) If H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 , together with its reflection across the <lb/>slice ℍ n × {𝜆 H r ,0 (𝜌 + )}, is a class C 2 sphere. <lb/>Theorem 2.23. Assume r odd, n &gt; r, and d r &gt; 0. By reflecting the rotational hypersurface given by the graph of <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r across suitable slices, we get a complete non-compact embedded H r -hypersurface. <lb/>(1) If 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, the hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,d r , together with its reflection across <lb/>the slice ℍ n × {0}, is a class C 2 annulus. When n = r + 1 and H r = 1∕(r + 1) the same holds, provided that <lb/>d r is smaller than (r -1)!!∕(r -2)!! for r &gt; 1, or smaller than 1 for r = 1. <lb/></body>

        <body>Remark 2.25. Let us comment on the last case of Table 1, i.e. d r &lt; 0 and r odd. Both types of hypersurfaces <lb/>noted there occur depending on the value of H r and d r . Also, S n-1 × S 1 occurs only if r ≥ 3. As 𝜆 H r ,d r (𝜌 + ) ≠ 0 gets <lb/>closer to the 𝜌-axis, the corresponding nodoids get more self-intersections, and the topology of the hypersurface <lb/>becomes non-trivial. <lb/>Remark 2.26. When -1 ≤ d n &lt; 0 and n is odd, all three cases in Table 3 occur depending on the value of the <lb/>parameter d n . <lb/>3 Translation H r -hypersurfaces <lb/>In the proof of Theorem 6.1, besides rotation hypersurfaces, we will need further H r -hypersurfaces as barriers. <lb/>The suitable ones are invariant under hyperbolic translation in ℍ n × ℝ with r-th mean curvature H r &gt; (n -<lb/>r)∕n. Hyperbolic translations in ℍ n × ℝ are hyperbolic translations in a slice ℍ n × {t} extended to be constant <lb/>on the vertical component, and will be described precisely later. When 0 &lt; H r &lt; (n -r)∕n, smooth complete <lb/>hypersurfaces invariant under hyperbolic translation are treated in [22]. The case r = 1 has already been studied <lb/>in [23], and an explicit description for n = 2 has been given by Manzano [29]. Therefore, we restrict to the case <lb/>r &gt; 1. <lb/>As in Section 2, given n, r, and H r &gt; 0, one finds a one-parameter family of functions describing the profile <lb/>of such translation hypersurfaces. Since we do not aim to give a complete classification of translation hyper-<lb/>surfaces, we will choose the parameter to be zero (see (11) below), and we will only describe a portion of the <lb/>hypersurface. This will be enough for our purposes. <lb/>Let us recall the construction of translation hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ by Bérard-Sa Earp [23]. For simplifying <lb/>the notation, we denote the zero-section ℍ n × {0} by ℍ n . Take 𝛾 in ℍ n to be a geodesic passing through 0. We <lb/>define V to be the vertical plane {(𝛾(𝜌), t): t, 𝜌 ∈ ℝ}. We now take 𝜋 to be a totally geodesic hyperplane in ℍ n <lb/>orthogonal to 𝛾 at the origin. We consider hyperbolic translations along a geodesic 𝛿 passing through 0 in 𝜋, <lb/>repeated slice-wise to get isometries of ℍ n × ℝ. Now take a curve defined by c(𝜌) := (tanh(𝜌∕2), 𝜇(𝜌)) in V, where <lb/>𝜇 is to be determined. For any 𝜌 &gt; 0, consider the section ℍ n × {𝜇(𝜌)}, and move the point c(𝜌) via the above <lb/>hyperbolic translations. On each slice, this gives a hypersurface M 𝜌 in ℍ n × {𝜇(𝜌)} through c(𝜌). Hence the curve <lb/>defined by c generates a translation hypersurface M = ∪ 𝜌 M 𝜌 in ℍ n × ℝ. <lb/>The principal curvatures of the hypersurface M, with respect to the unit normal pointing upwards are <lb/>k 1 = • • • = k n-1 = <lb/>μ <lb/>(1 + μ2 ) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>tanh(𝜌), <lb/>k n = <lb/>μ <lb/>(1 + μ2 ) <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>Then <lb/>nH r = (n -r) tanh r (𝜌) <lb/>μr <lb/>(1 + μ2 ) r∕2 + tanh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>r μr-1 μ <lb/>(1 + μ2 ) <lb/>r+2 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>This is equivalent to the identity <lb/>nH r <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜌) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>= <lb/>d <lb/>d𝜌 <lb/>( <lb/>cosh n-r (𝜌) <lb/>μr <lb/>(1 + μ2 ) <lb/>r <lb/>2 <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>r = 1, … , n. <lb/>(10) <lb/>Note that now the integrals <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜏) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>d𝜏 <lb/>are not well-defined for r &gt; 1, because <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜏) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>d𝜏 ≥ <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>cosh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>d𝜏 ≥ <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>cotgh(𝜏) d𝜏 = ∞. <lb/></body>

        <body>Figure 8: Behavior of 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 for r &gt; 1. <lb/>We then choose 𝜖 &gt; 0 and define <lb/>J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌) := <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜖 <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜏) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜏) <lb/>d𝜏, and J n,1 (𝜌) := <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>0 <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜏) d𝜏, <lb/>𝜌 &gt; 0. <lb/>Then one can integrate (10) twice and set the constant of integration to be zero, so as to obtain <lb/>𝜇 H r ,𝜖 (𝜌) = <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜖 <lb/>(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜉)) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>cosh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r <lb/>(𝜉) -(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜉)) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>d𝜉, <lb/>𝜌 ≥ 𝜖. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Again, 𝜇 depends on H r , and 𝜖, so we write 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 to be precise. <lb/>Remark 3.1. Note that we have defined 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 in (11) for 𝜌 ≥ 𝜖. is because we are only interested in the <lb/>portion of translation hypersurface described by the graph of 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 for 𝜌 ≥ 𝜖. The tangent line to the curve <lb/>described by 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 at 𝜌 = 𝜖 is horizontal for all r, and 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 is increasing for 𝜌 &gt; 𝜖. The second derivative of <lb/>𝜇 H r ,𝜖 (t) is computed as <lb/>μH r ,𝜖 (𝜌) = <lb/>sinh(𝜌) cosh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r -1 (𝜌) <lb/>( <lb/>nH r <lb/>cosh n (𝜌) <lb/>sinh r (𝜌) -(n -r)(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌)) <lb/>) <lb/>r(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌)) <lb/>r-1 <lb/>r <lb/>( <lb/>cosh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r <lb/>(𝜌) -(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌)) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>) 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>(12) <lb/>This expression will be used when studying the convexity of 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 and its regularity up to second order. <lb/>Remark 3.2. Let us discuss a few details on J n,r,𝜖 for r &gt; 1 and 𝜌 &gt; 𝜖. It is clear that J n,r,𝜖 (𝜖) = 0 and <lb/>lim 𝜌→+∞ J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌) = +∞. Further, J ′ <lb/>n,r,𝜖 (𝜌) &gt; 0 for 𝜌 ≥ 𝜖. Hence J n,r,𝜖 is a bijection between (𝜖, ∞) and (0, +∞). <lb/>For n &gt; r, we have the asymptotic behavior (n -r) J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌) ≈ cosh n-r (𝜌) for 𝜌 → +∞, and for n = r we have <lb/>J n,n,𝜖 (𝜌) ≈ 𝜌 for 𝜌 → +∞. <lb/>We fix r &gt; 1H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, and 𝜖 &gt; 0, and study the function <lb/>𝜇 H r ,𝜖 (𝜌) := <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜖 <lb/>(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜉)) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>√ <lb/>cosh <lb/>2(n-r) <lb/>r <lb/>(𝜉) -(nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜉)) <lb/>2 <lb/>r <lb/>d𝜉. <lb/>Proposition 3.3.

        <body>Notice that 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ is finite if and only if <lb/>f 𝜖 (𝜌) := cosh n-r (𝜌) -nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌) <lb/>admits a zero. One has f 𝜖 (𝜖) &gt; 0, whereas the derivative of f 𝜖 is <lb/>f ′ <lb/>𝜖 (𝜌) = <lb/>cosh n-1 (𝜌) <lb/>sinh r-1 (𝜌) <lb/>((n -r) tanh r (𝜌) -nH r ), <lb/>and is negative since H r &gt; (n -r)∕n. Moreover, f ′ <lb/>𝜖 tends to -∞, hence a zero 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ exists and is unique. For n = r, <lb/>f 𝜖 reduces to 1 -nH n J n,𝜖 , which has a zero 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ &gt; 𝜖 regardless of the value of H n &gt; 0. The remaining details on <lb/>the behavior of 𝜇 H n ,𝜖 follow as in previous section. <lb/>□ <lb/>Remark 3.4. The technique used for Proposition 2.8 can be combined with (12) and yields C 2 -regularity of the <lb/>translation H r -hypersurface at points corresponding to 𝜌 = 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ . At points corresponding to 𝜌 = 𝜖 when r &gt; 1 we <lb/>only have regularity C 1 . <lb/>By using the translation defined at the beginning of this section on the curves defined in Proposition 3.3, <lb/>one gets translation H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ, which we describe in the following theorem. Recall that 𝜋 is <lb/>the totally geodesic hyperplane in ℍ n orthogonal to the plane containing the support of the curve given by the <lb/>function 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 at the origin. <lb/>Theorem 3.5. Let r &gt; 1, H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, and 𝜖 &gt; 0. Reflect the graph of 𝜇 H r ,𝜖 on <lb/>[ <lb/>𝜖, 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ <lb/>] <lb/>with respect to the hor-<lb/>izontal slice ℍ n × <lb/>{ <lb/>𝜇 H r ,𝜖 <lb/>( <lb/>𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ <lb/>)} <lb/>. Translating the arc obtained along geodesics through the origin in 𝜋 gives an <lb/>H r -hypersurface with the topology of ℝ n-1 × [0, 1] and of class C 2 away from the boundary. The boundary com-<lb/>ponents are planar equidistant hypersurfaces with distance 𝜖 from 𝜋, they lie in two different slices, and can be <lb/>obtained from one another by a vertical translation. <lb/>4 Estimates <lb/>In this section we collect estimates that will be needed in the proof of Theorem 6.1. We define radii and heights <lb/>related to pieces of the hypersurfaces classified in the previous sections, and study the interplay between them. <lb/>First we need to compare spheres and horizontal cylinders. <lb/>Fix n ≥ r &gt; 1 and H r &gt; (n -r)∕n. Denote by  r the sphere in ℍ n × ℝ with r-th mean curvature H r , namely <lb/>the compact rotation hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 H r ,0 in Theorems 2.10, 2.12, 2.22, 2.24. Let R  r := 𝜌 + , <lb/>where 𝜌 + was defined as the length of the domain of 𝜆 H r ,0 . <lb/>For any 𝜖 &gt; 0, let us denote by  r,𝜖 the H r -hypersurface described in Theorem 3.5, which is a portion of a <lb/>horizontal cylinder. Set R  r,𝜖 := 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ -𝜖 where 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ is the unique value such that <lb/>f 𝜖 (𝜌 + ) = cosh n-r (𝜌 + ) -nH r J n,r,𝜖 (𝜌 + ) = 0. <lb/>Note that  r,𝜖 has a horizontal hyperplane of symmetry P and R  r,𝜖 is the distance between the projection of <lb/>the boundary of  r,𝜖 on P and  r,𝜖 ∩ P. <lb/>The next estimate will be used in Claim II for the proof of Theorem 6.1. <lb/>Lemma 4.1. For all n, r, H r with n ≥ r &gt; 1 and H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, there exists a positive 𝜖 = 𝜖(n, r, H r ) such that <lb/>R  r,𝜖 &lt; R  r . <lb/>Remark 4.2.

        <body>Proof. We have already shown that for H r &gt; (n -r)∕n (or H n &gt; 0) the function f 𝜖 is decreasing. Since 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ &gt; 𝜖, <lb/>we have lim 𝜖→∞ 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ = ∞. <lb/>Note that the function 𝜖 ↦ 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ is continuous and increasing. To see this, let 0 &lt; a &lt; b and 𝜌 &gt; 0, so that <lb/>J n,r,a (𝜌) = <lb/>b <lb/>∫ <lb/>a <lb/>cosh n-1 (x) <lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>dx + <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>b <lb/>cosh n-1 (x) <lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>dx &gt; <lb/>𝜌 <lb/>∫ <lb/>b <lb/>cosh n-1 (x) <lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>dx = J n,r,b (𝜌). <lb/>It follows that <lb/>f a <lb/>( <lb/>𝜌 b <lb/>+ <lb/>) &lt; cosh n-r ( <lb/>𝜌 b <lb/>+ <lb/>) -nH r J n,r,b <lb/>( <lb/>𝜌 b <lb/>+ <lb/>) = f b <lb/>( 𝜌 b <lb/>+ <lb/>) = 0 = f a <lb/>( <lb/>𝜌 a <lb/>+ <lb/>) <lb/>. <lb/>Since f a is decreasing, 𝜌 b <lb/>+ &gt; 𝜌 a <lb/>+ holds. <lb/>We claim that 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ &lt; <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖 if 𝜖 is small enough. By definition of 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ and the fact that f 𝜖 is decreasing, it is <lb/>enough to prove that f 𝜖 ( <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖) &lt; 0 for 𝜖 small enough. Since the function xcosh(x) -sinh(x) is positive for x &gt; 0, <lb/>we deduce that <lb/>cosh n-1 (x) <lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>= cosh n-r (x) <lb/>cosh r-1 (x) <lb/>sinh r-1 (x) <lb/>&gt; <lb/>1 <lb/>x r-1 , <lb/>whence <lb/>J n,r,𝜖 ( <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖) ≥ <lb/>⎧ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎨ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>⎩ <lb/>-<lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>log(𝜖) <lb/>if r = 2, <lb/>1 <lb/>r -2 <lb/>( <lb/>𝜖 2-r -𝜖 <lb/>2-r <lb/>2 <lb/>) <lb/>if r &gt; 2. <lb/>In both cases lim 𝜖→0 J n,r,𝜖 ( <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖) = +∞. It follows that f 𝜖 ( <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖) &lt; 0 for 𝜖 sufficiently small, hence the claim is <lb/>proved. We deduce that 𝜖 &lt; 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ &lt; <lb/>√ <lb/>𝜖 for 𝜖 small, so lim 𝜖→0 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ = 0. <lb/>Given n ≥ r &gt; 1 and H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, the value of R  r is fixed. By the above statements, there is a value of <lb/>𝜖 &gt; 0 such that R  r,𝜖 &lt; 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ &lt; R  r . <lb/>□ <lb/>The next type of hypersurfaces we consider are annuli. Let n &gt; r, H r = (n -r)∕n, and choose d r &gt; 0. For <lb/>these values of the parameters, the functions 𝜆 H r ,d r for r even and odd share the same behavior. Specifically, they <lb/>have a zero 𝜌 -, which is the only solution of sinh n-r (𝜌) -(nH r I n,r (𝜌) + d r ) = 0, and start with vertical tangent. <lb/>After a vertical reflection across the slice ℍ n × {0} and rotation about a vertical axis, each curve produces an <lb/>unbounded annulus (see Theorems 1.11, 1.23). <lb/>Let us highlight a property of d r that will simplify our calculations. Since nI n,r (𝜌) ≈ 𝜌 n for 𝜌 close to 0, for <lb/>𝜌 -small we estimate <lb/>d r = sinh n-r (𝜌 -) -nH r I n,r (𝜌 -) ≈ 𝜌 n-r <lb/>--H r 𝜌 n <lb/>-= 𝜌 n-r <lb/>-<lb/>( <lb/>1 -H r 𝜌 r <lb/>-<lb/>) <lb/>. <lb/>This implies <lb/>lim <lb/>d r →0 <lb/>d r <lb/>𝜌 n-r <lb/>-<lb/>= 1. <lb/>(13) <lb/>We need to consider the portion of the previous annulus between the slices ℍ n × {0} and ℍ n × {h * }, where <lb/>h * is defined as <lb/>h * := <lb/>2𝜌 -<lb/>∫ <lb/>𝜌 -<lb/>((n -r)I n,r (𝜉) + d r ) <lb/>1 <lb/>r <lb/>sinh <lb/>n-r <lb/>r (𝜉) <lb/>d𝜉. <lb/>(14) <lb/>Observe that by (13) we can interpret h * as an approximation of the value 𝜆 (n-r)∕r,d r (2𝜌 -) for 𝜌 -small. <lb/>Moreover h * &lt; 𝜆 (n-r)∕r,d r (2𝜌 -). <lb/>Let now n = r. For d n &gt; 0 small enough, we consider portions of the peaked spheres found in Theorems 1.12 <lb/>and 1.24, so that the cases n even and odd can be treated together. Here 𝜌 -is not defined a priori, so we choose <lb/>𝜌 -= d 2∕n <lb/>n and define h * as follows (by abuse of notation, we use the notation h * as above) <lb/></body>

This <lb/>hypersurface of ℍ n generalizes the well-known limaçon de Pascal in the Euclidean plane, and it will play an <lb/>important role in the proof of Theorem 6.1. We start by recalling its definition. <lb/>Definition 5.1. Let A and C be two distinct points in ℍ n , and c &gt; 0 be a constant. Let  be the geodesic sphere with <lb/>radius c centered at C. For any P ∈  define A P to be the reflection of A across the totally geodesic hyperplane <lb/>in ℍ n tangent to  at P. The set <lb/> := {A P ∈ ℍ n : P ∈ } <lb/>is called hyperbolic limaçon, and A is called base point of . <lb/>Since the hyperbolic space is two-points homogeneous, up to isometries of the ambient space  depends only <lb/>on two parameters: a := d(A, C), where d is the hyperbolic distance, and c &gt; 0 as in Definition 4.1. The shape of <lb/> changes depending on whether a = c, a &lt; c, or a &gt; c. Here we are only interested in the latter case. We refer <lb/>to Nelli-Pipoli [27, Section 2] for general properties of . <lb/>The following result improves [27, Lemma 2.5] and will allow to remove the pinching assumption in [27, <lb/>Theorem 4.1]. <lb/>Lemma 5.2. Take  to be the hyperbolic limaçon with a &gt; c and base point A. Let  be the geodesic sphere defining <lb/>, C be its center, and X be the point of  with minimal distance from A. Then  has two loops, one inside the other, <lb/>and it has a self-intersection only at A. Moreover the following statements hold. <lb/>(1) The smaller (resp. larger) loop of  is contained in (resp. contains) the disk centered at X and radius a -c. <lb/>(2) The smaller loop of  bounds the disk centered at X and radius <lb/>𝓁(a, c) := cosh -1 <lb/>( <lb/>cosh(a -c) -<lb/>sinh c <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>sinh 2 (a -c) <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>(18) <lb/>(3) All of  sits inside the disk centered at C and radius a + 2c. <lb/>Proof. Since a &gt; c,  has two loops, one inside the other, and has a self-intersection only at A, cf. [27, Lemma 2.4]. <lb/>The estimates (1) and (3) have been proved in [27, Lemma 2.5]. It remains to prove (2). <lb/>Since  is invariant with respect to rotations about the geodesic passing through A and C, we can assume <lb/>n = 2. We start by giving an explicit parametrization of  in the hyperboloid model for the hyperbolic space <lb/>canonically embedded in the Minkowski space ℝ 2,1 = (ℝ 3 , q), where q is the standard scalar product of signature <lb/>(2, 1). Without loss of generality, we can assume that A = (sinha, 0, cosha), and the center of  to be (0, 0, 1). Then <lb/>we parametrize  by <lb/>𝛼(𝜃) = (sinh c cos 𝜃, sinh c sin 𝜃, cosh c). <lb/>Let P = 𝛼(𝜃) for some 𝜃. We want to find the unique geodesic 𝛾 P through P tangent to  explicitly: 𝛾 P is the <lb/>geodesic passing through P and generated by the unit tangent vector to  at P, which is <lb/>T(𝜃) = <lb/>𝛼 ′ (𝜃) <lb/>√ <lb/>q(𝛼 ′ (𝜃), 𝛼 ′ (𝜃)) <lb/>= (-sin 𝜃, cos 𝜃, 0). <lb/>Therefore 𝛾 P = ℍ 2 ∩ Π P , where Π P is the plane in ℝ 2,1 passing through O, P, and parallel to T. A unit normal <lb/>to Π P with respect to q is the vector <lb/>𝜈(𝜃) = (cosh c cos 𝜃, cosh c sin 𝜃, sinh c). <lb/></body>

Since the reflection in ℍ 2 across 𝛾 P is the restriction <lb/>to ℍ 2 of the reflection in ℝ 2,1 across Π P , it follows that  can be parametrized as <lb/>L(𝜃) = A -2q(A, 𝜈(𝜃))𝜈(𝜃). <lb/>The point of  at minimal distance from A is X = (sinhc, 0, coshc). Since a &gt; c, then X is in the compact <lb/>region bounded by the smaller loop of the hyperbolic limaçon. The strategy now is to compute the distance <lb/>between X and , then the smaller loop of  will bound a disk centered at X and radius the above distance. It is <lb/>well known that the hyperbolic distance in the upper hyperboloid is <lb/>d(A, B) = cosh -1 (-q(A, B)), <lb/>A, B ∈ ℍ 2 . <lb/>In order to find the critical points of the function 𝜃 ↦ d(X, L(𝜃)), it is enough to find the critical points of <lb/>the function 𝜃 ↦ q(X, L(𝜃)). We have <lb/>q(X, L(𝜃)) = -cosh(a -c) + q(𝜃) sinh 2 c(1 -cos 𝜃), <lb/>where q(𝜃) := q(A, 𝜈(𝜃)) = cosh c sinh a cos 𝜃 -sinh c cosh a. Explicit computations give <lb/>d <lb/>d𝜃 <lb/>( <lb/>q(X, L(𝜃)) <lb/>) = sinh 2 c sin 𝜃(2 sinh a cosh c cos 𝜃 -sinh(a + c)). <lb/>Hence critical points are given by <lb/>sin 𝜃 = 0, <lb/>and <lb/>cos 𝜃 = <lb/>sinh(a + c) <lb/>2 sinh a cosh c <lb/>. <lb/>(19) <lb/>The case 𝜃 = 0 yields a new proof of [27, Lemma 2.5, part 1]. The case 𝜃 = 𝜋 produces a disk centered at X <lb/>and radius a + 3c, which is worse than the disk in [27, Lemma 2.5, part 3]. The case of interest is now the last <lb/>one. Let 𝜃 0 be such that cos 𝜃 0 satisfies the second identity in (19). Then <lb/>q(X, L(𝜃 0 )) = -cosh(a -c) + <lb/>sinh c <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>sinh 2 (a -c). <lb/>We then have <lb/>d(X, ) = 𝓁(a, c) = cosh -1 <lb/>( <lb/>cosh(a -c) -<lb/>sinh c <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>sinh 2 (a -c) <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>hence the smaller loop of  bounds a disk of center X and radius 𝓁(a, c). <lb/>□ <lb/>We conclude this section with a list of properties of 𝓁 which will be useful for the estimates in the proof of <lb/>Theorem 6.1. <lb/>Lemma 5.3. The following properties hold. <lb/>(1) For any a &gt; c ≥ 0, 𝓁(a, 0) = a, 𝓁(a, a) = 0, and 𝓁(a, c) &gt; 0. Moreover 𝓁(a, c) &lt; a -c. <lb/>(2) The function (a, c) ↦ 𝓁(a, c) with domain {(a, c) ∈ ℝ 2 : a &gt; c &gt; 0} is increasing in the first variable and <lb/>decreasing in the second one. <lb/>(3) For any x &gt; 0, then 𝓁(4x, 2x) &gt; x. <lb/>Proof. The properties in (1) follow directly by the definition of 𝓁, cf. (18). <lb/>As for (2), we have <lb/>𝜕 <lb/>𝜕a <lb/>cosh(𝓁(a, c)) = <lb/>sinh(a -c) <lb/>2 sinh 2 a <lb/>( <lb/>2 sinh 2 a -sinh 2 c -cosh(a -c) sinh a sinh c <lb/>) <lb/>&gt; <lb/>sinh(a -c) <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>( <lb/>sinh a -cosh(a -c) sinh c <lb/>) <lb/></body>

        <body>= <lb/>sinh 2 (a -c) cosh c <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>&gt; 0, <lb/>where we have used the fact that a &gt; c &gt; 0. Likewise <lb/>𝜕 <lb/>𝜕c <lb/>cosh(𝓁(a, c)) = -<lb/>sinh(a -c) <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>(2 sinh a + cosh c sinh(a -c) -2 sinh c cosh(a -c)) <lb/>= -<lb/>3 sinh 2 (a -c) cosh c <lb/>2 sinh a <lb/>&lt; 0. <lb/>Since the functions sinh and cosh are increasing in [0, +∞), the claim follows. <lb/>Let us now prove (3).

The latter holds true for all x &gt; 0, and <lb/>we are done. <lb/>□ <lb/>6 Ros-Rosenberg type theorem <lb/>The second goal of the present paper is to prove a topological result about compact connected H r -hypersurfaces <lb/>embedded in ℍ n × ℝ with planar boundary. This is a generalization of the classical result of Ros and Rosenberg <lb/>[25] about the topology of constant mean curvature surfaces in the Euclidean three-dimensional space. <lb/>Theorem 6.1. Let M be a compact connected hypersurface embedded in ℍ n × [0, ∞) ⊂ ℍ n × ℝ with boundary a <lb/>closed horoconvex (n -1)-dimensional hypersurface Γ embedded in the horizontal slice ℍ n × {0}. Assume M has <lb/>constant r-th mean curvature H r &gt; (n -r)∕n for some r = 1, . . . , n. Then there is a constant 𝛿 = 𝛿(n, r, H r ) &gt; 0 <lb/>small enough such that, if Γ is contained in a disk of radius 𝛿, then M is topologically a disk. <lb/>We recall that a hypersurface Γ of the hyperbolic space is called horoconvex if all its principal curvatures <lb/>are larger than one. <lb/>Remark 6.2. Let us make a few observations. <lb/>(1) When r = 1, Theorem 6.1 improves [27, Theorem 4.1]. In fact, thanks to the new estimates given in <lb/>Lemma 4.2 (2), we do not need to assume any pinching on Γ. <lb/>(2) Elbert-Sa Earp [21, Theorem 7.7] proved that when n &gt; r and 0 &lt; H r ≤ (n -r)∕n, then a compact con-<lb/>nected H r -hypersurface M embedded in ℍ n × [0, ∞) with horoconvex boundary Γ in the slice ℍ n × {0} is <lb/>necessarily a graph over the compact planar domain bounded by Γ. In particular M is a disk. Therefore, <lb/>we focus on the cases n &gt; r, with H r &gt; (n -r)∕n, and n = r, with H n &gt; 0. <lb/>(3) By using Alexandrov reflections with respect to vertical hyperplanes, we can show that M shares the same <lb/>symmetries of its boundary. In particular, when Γ is a geodesic sphere, M is rotationally symmetric. It <lb/>follows that M is a portion of one of the compact hypersurfaces classified in Section 2, and Theorem 6.1 is <lb/>proved in this special case. <lb/>In view of the previous remark, we will assume throughout that Γ is not a geodesic sphere. <lb/></body>

        <body>Remark 6.3. In the following we will do extensive use of the tangency principle for H r -hypersurfaces as it is <lb/>stated in [24, Theorem 1.1]. In order to satisfy the assumptions there, it is enough that the hypersurface M in <lb/>Theorem 6.1 has a strictly convex point. This is guaranteed by [21, Lemma 7.5]. <lb/>Notations. Let us introduce some notations that will be useful in the proof of Theorem 6.1. For the reader&apos;s <lb/>convenience, there is a list of notations at the end of the article. We denote by Ω the compact domain of ℍ n × <lb/>{0} bounded by Γ and by W the compact domain in ℍ n × ℝ with boundary M ∪ Ω. Given n ≥ r ≥ 2, and H r &gt; <lb/>(n -r)∕n, we fix an 𝜖 &gt; 0 such that Lemma 3.1 is satisfied. Denote by  r :=  r,𝜖 the corresponding translation <lb/>H r -hypersurface of Theorem 3.5. When r = 1 we use the same notation, however recall that no choice of 𝜖 is <lb/>involved. Let h  r denote the height of  r (namely 2𝜇 H (𝜌 + ) for r = 1 and 2𝜇 H r ,𝜖 <lb/>( <lb/>𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ <lb/>) <lb/>for r &gt; 1). Analogously let <lb/>h  r be the height of  r (i.e. 2𝜆 H r ,0 (𝜌 + ), cf. Theorems 1.10, 1.12, 1.22, 1.24). We define h M to be the height of M with <lb/>respect to the slice ℍ n × {0}. The exterior (resp. interior) radius of Γ is the smaller (resp. larger) radius 𝜌 such that <lb/>for any p ∈ Γ there is a geodesic sphere S with radius 𝜌 tangent to Γ at p and Γ sits in (resp. encloses) the closed <lb/>ball with boundary S. We write r ext for the exterior radius and r int for the interior one. Clearly r ext ≥ r int , and <lb/>equality occurs if and only if Γ is a geodesic sphere. Moreover, since Γ is horoconvex, r int and r ext are determined <lb/>by the maximum and the minimum of the principal curvatures of Γ. Finally we denote by D(R) any disk of radius <lb/>R &gt; 0 in a horizontal slice of ℍ n × ℝ. <lb/>The strategy of the proof of Theorem 6.1 is similar to that of [27]: if the height of M is less than the height of <lb/> r , then M is a graph over Ω, otherwise it is a union of hypersurfaces, each one a graph over a suitable domain. <lb/>As in [25], at the end of the proof it will be clear that the union of such graphs has the topology of the disk. The <lb/>hyperbolic limaçon described in Section 5 will be used in various estimates. <lb/>Lemma 6.4. Let M and Γ satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 6.1. There is a disk D(r min ) in ℍ n × {0} such that <lb/>M ∩ (D(r min ) × ℝ) is a graph, and 𝓁(r ext , r ext -r int ) ≤ r min &lt; r int . In particular, r min depends only on the principal <lb/>curvatures of Γ. <lb/>Proof. In order to prove the statement, we apply Alexandrov&apos;s reflection technique with horizontal hyperplanes <lb/>coming down from above. Since M is compact, the slice ℍ n × {t}, t &gt; h M does not intersect M. Then we let <lb/>t decrease. When t &lt; h M , reflect the part above the slice and stop if there is a first contact point between M <lb/>and its reflection. If we can get to t = 0 without having contact points, then M is a graph over Ω and we can <lb/>choose r min &lt; r int . If this does not happen, there will be a 0 &lt; t 0 &lt; h M ∕2 such that the reflected hypersurface <lb/>touches M for the first time. If the intersection point lied in the interior of M we would have a contradiction <lb/>with the Maximum Principle, hence a first touching point belongs to Γ. Let q be one of such points. Then the line <lb/>{q} × (0, ∞) intersects M exactly once, and {q} × (0, 2t 0 ) is contained in the interior of W, as t 0 &lt; h M ∕2. Note <lb/>that the portion of M above ℍ n × {t 0 } is a graph. <lb/>We now perform Alexandrov&apos;s reflections with respect to vertical hyperplanes, i.e. the product of a totally <lb/>geodesic hypersurface of ℍ n and ℝ. Let Q be one of such hyperplanes. Since M is compact, we can assume that <lb/>Q ∩ M = ∅. Fix a point x ∈ Q and let 𝛾 be the geodesic passing through x and orthogonal to Q. Move Q along 𝛾 <lb/>towards M such that Q is always orthogonal to 𝛾. By abuse of notation, we call again Q any parallel translation <lb/>of the initial hyperplane. When Q touches M for the first time, keep moving Q and start reflecting through Q <lb/>the part of M left behind Q. In order not to have a contradiction with the Maximum Principle, we can continue <lb/>this procedure with no contact points between M and its reflection until Q enters Γ at distance at least r int <lb/>from it. <lb/>We can avoid the dependence on the contact point q by stopping reflecting when Q is tangent to , where <lb/> is as follows. Denote by  ext the geodesic sphere in ℍ n × {0} of radius r ext , tangent to Γ at q, and enclosing Γ. <lb/>Then  is the geodesic sphere with the same center as that of  ext and radius equal to r ext -r int . <lb/>Define  to be the set of the reflections of q through any vertical hyperplane tangent to . It follows that <lb/> is a hyperbolic limaçon as in Definition 4.1 whose base point is q and whose parameters are a = r ext and <lb/>c = r ext -r int . Since a &gt; c,  has two loops. Moreover, since Γ is horoconvex, the smaller loop of  sits in Ω. <lb/></body>

        <body>Furthermore, since {q} × ℝ intersects M in exactly one point, then the same holds true for any p in the <lb/>compact planar domain bounded by the smaller loop of . Define r min as the largest radius of a ball bounded by <lb/>the smaller loop of . Then M ∩ (D(r min ) × ℝ) is a graph. Finally Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 imply 𝓁(r ext , r ext -<lb/>r int ) ≤ r min &lt; r int at once. We remark that r min depends only on a and c, namely only on the curvature of Γ, but <lb/>not on q. <lb/>□ <lb/>Proof of Theorem 6.1. We first assume h M &lt; h  r . <lb/>Recall that R  r = 𝜌 𝜖 <lb/>+ -𝜖 for r &gt; 1, and R  1 = 𝜌 + . We can then adapt the proof as in Nelli-Pipoli [27] to our <lb/>case. <lb/>Claim I. The hypersurface M lies in D(r ext + R  r ) × [0, h  r ). <lb/>Proof. Consider the H r -hypersurface  r . Its lower boundary is in the slice ℍ n × {0} and the upper boundary <lb/>sits in the slice ℍ n × {h  r }. We call  r any horizontal translation or rotation of  r . Since M is compact, we <lb/>can translate  r horizontally so that M ∩  r = ∅ and M lies in the part of  r containing the axis of  r . Then <lb/>we move  r isometrically towards M until  r touches M for the first time (see Figure 9). By the Maximum <lb/>Principle,  r and M do not touch at any interior point. Since h M &lt; h  r , the first touching point belongs to Γ. <lb/>The same steps can be repeated for  r with any horizontal axis. By definition of r ext we get that M sits inside <lb/>D(r ext + R  r ) × [0, h  r ). <lb/>□ <lb/>Claim II. If Γ is sufficiently small, then M is contained in the cylinder Ω × ℝ. <lb/>Proof. By Lemma 3.1 and our choice of 𝜖 one has R  r &lt; R  r . Recall that  r is the sphere with the same r-th mean <lb/>curvature as that of M. Cut  r with its horizontal hyperplane of symmetry and let  + <lb/>r be the upper hemisphere. <lb/>Now take Γ small enough so that R  r + r ext &lt; R  r . Translate  + <lb/>r horizontally in such a way that the intersection <lb/>of its axis of rotation with the slice ℍ n × {0} coincides with the center of the disk found in Claim I. Translate <lb/>upwards  + <lb/>r such that  + <lb/>r ∩ M = ∅. By the Maximum Principle, Claim I, and the hypothesis on Γ, we can translate <lb/> + <lb/>r downwards without having a contact point between  + <lb/>r and M until the boundary of  + <lb/>r is contained in the <lb/>slice ℍ n × {0}, whence M is below  + <lb/>r (see Figure 10). <lb/>By the Maximum Principle and the fact that r ext &lt; R  r , one can translate horizontally  + <lb/>r without having a <lb/>contact point with M until  + <lb/>r becomes tangent to Γ at any point of Γ, which gives the claim. <lb/>□ <lb/>Claim III. The hypersurface M is a graph over Ω, hence it is a disk. <lb/>Proof. By Alexandrov&apos;s reflections technique with horizontal hyperplanes coming down from above, it follows <lb/>that M is a graph over Ω, which proves Theorem 6.1 when h M &lt; h  r . Observe that 𝛿 can be taken as R  r -R  r , <lb/>cf. Claim II. <lb/>□ <lb/>Figure 9: Here is a representation for n = 2. The black circle is the boundary at infinity of the slice ℍ 2 × {0}, M is the blue surface whose <lb/>red boundary Γ lies in ℍ 2 × {0}. One moves the purple half-cylinder  r,𝜖 isometrically towards M. Note that M may have non-trivial <lb/>topology. <lb/></body>

        <body>We now assume that h M ≥ h  r . Alexandrov&apos;s reflection technique with horizontal and vertical hyperplanes <lb/>guarantees that the part of M above the plane t = h M ∕2 is a graph over a domain of ℍ n × {0} and that the part <lb/>of M outside the cylinder Ω × ℝ is a graph over a domain of Γ × ℝ. The goal is to prove that M is the union of <lb/>such graphs, i.e. M ∩ (Ω × (0, h M ∕2]) is empty. In this way it will be clear that M has the topology of a disk (see <lb/>Figure 11). <lb/>Recall the definition of h * in (14) for n &gt; r and (15) for n = r. Hereafter we show that Ω × <lb/>[ <lb/>h * , h M ∕2 <lb/>] <lb/>contains <lb/>no point of M if Γ is small enough, and lastly we prove that there is no interior point of M in Ω × [0, h * ] as well. <lb/>Before doing this we discuss how the various quantities we use are related to one another. Let d r &gt; 0 be <lb/>such that <lb/>𝓁(r ext , r ext -r int ) ≤ 𝜌 -≤ r min &lt; r int &lt; r ext , <lb/>where r min is the radius defined in Lemma 6.4 and 𝜌 -is the minimum of the interval where 𝜆 (n-r)∕n,d r is defined <lb/>when n &gt; r (see Section 2), and for n = r was chosen in Section 4 to be d n <lb/>2∕n . Note that if r ext → 0, i.e. Γ shrinks <lb/>to a point, then d r → 0, and so 𝜌 -, h * , and 𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>go to zero as well (cf. Lemma 3.3). Hence if r ext is small enough, <lb/>then h * ≪ h M <lb/>2 . Further, since 𝓁(r ext , r ext -r int ) &gt; 0, we can find 𝛼 &gt; 0 such that <lb/>𝛼r ext &lt; 𝓁(r ext , r ext -r int ) ≤ 𝜌 -, <lb/>(20) <lb/>whence 𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>∕r ext &gt; 𝛼𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>∕𝜌 -. Taking Γ small enough, by Lemma 3.3 we have <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>r ext <lb/>&gt; 𝛼 <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>𝜌 -<lb/>&gt; 3, <lb/>therefore we can assume <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r &gt; 3r ext . <lb/>(21) <lb/>Figure 10: The red surface is a spherical cap S + <lb/>r moving downwards isometrically. <lb/>Figure 11: Decomposition of M: the part of M above the green hyperplane and the part of M outside the red cylinder are graphs. <lb/></body>

        <body>Claim IV. The compact domain bounded by M ∩ <lb/>( <lb/>ℍ n × {h M -h * } <lb/>) <lb/>contains a geodesic segment of length at <lb/>least 𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>. <lb/>Proof. Alexandrov&apos;s technique with respect to horizontal hyperplanes implies that the reflection of points in M <lb/>at height h M across the hyperplane ℍ n × {h M ∕2} sits in the closure of Ω. We can assume that one of these points <lb/>lies on the t-axis after applying a horizontal isometry. Let M ′ be the portion of M above the hyperplane ℍ n × <lb/>{h M -h * }. Then M ′ is a graph with height h * . Suppose that for any p ∈ 𝜕M ′ the distance between p and the t-axis <lb/>is smaller than 𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>. Cut  r with a horizontal hyperplane so that the spherical cap S ′ <lb/>r above that hyperplane has <lb/>height h * . Then translate  ′ <lb/>r up until it has empty intersection with M, then move it downwards. The Maximum <lb/>Principle implies there is no contact point between  ′ <lb/>r and the interior of M ′ at least until the boundary of  ′ <lb/>r <lb/>reaches the level t = h M -h * . Therefore the height of M ′ is less than h * , which is a contradiction. <lb/>□ <lb/>Claim V. The domain bounded by M ∩ <lb/>( <lb/>ℍ n × {h M -h * } <lb/>) <lb/>contains a disk D(R) with R &gt; 𝓁(𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>-r ext , r ext ). <lb/>Proof. Up to horizontal translation, we can assume that one of the endpoints of the geodesic segment found in <lb/>Claim IV is on the t-axis. Let p be the other endpoint. Consider a geodesic sphere  ext of ℍ n × {0} tangent to Γ <lb/>and containing Γ. Reflect the point p across any vertical hyperplane tangent to  ext in ℍ n × ℝ. <lb/>The set of such reflections is a hyperbolic limaçon  in ℍ n × {h M -h * } with base point p (see Figures 12 <lb/>and 13). By the choice of p, the parameters of  are a &gt; 𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>-r ext and c = r ext . By (21), a &gt; c, so  has two loops, <lb/>and the smaller one is contained in W -argue as in Lemma 5.4. The claim now follows by Lemma 4.2. <lb/>□ <lb/>Claim VI. The intersection between M and D(R) × <lb/>[ <lb/>h * , h M -h * ] <lb/>is empty. <lb/>Proof. Claim V implies that D(R) is contained in W, and since we have chosen h * ≪ h M , the hyperplane <lb/>ℍ n × {h M -h * } is above the hyperplane ℍ n × {h M ∕2}. By applying the Alexandrov&apos;s reflection technique with <lb/>horizontal hyperplanes, the reflection of D(R) across ℍ n × {𝜏} is contained in W for all 𝜏 ∈ <lb/>[ <lb/>h M ∕2, h M -h * ] <lb/>. <lb/>The claim then follows. <lb/>□ <lb/>Claim VII. There is no point of M in the cylinder Ω × {0 &lt; t ≤ h * } (see Figure 14). <lb/>Figure 12: The orange curve is the hyperbolic limaçon. <lb/>Figure 13: The hyperbolic limaçon from above. <lb/></body>

        <body>Figure 14: M does not intersect the red cylinder. This final step shows that M has the topology of a disk. <lb/>Proof. If n &gt; r, Σ will denote the portion of the rotational hypersurface generated by the graph of 𝜆 (n-r)∕n,d r <lb/>contained in (D(2𝜌 -)∖D(𝜌 -)) × ℝ. For n = r, Σ will denote the portion of a peaked sphere generated by the graph <lb/>of 𝜆 H n ,d n contained in (D(2𝜌 -)∖D(𝜌 -)) × ℝ. Note that if n &gt; r, then the r-th mean curvature of Σ is strictly smaller <lb/>than that of M, while if n = r the nth mean curvatures of M and Σ coincide. <lb/>In both cases Γ and d r &gt; 0 are chosen small enough so that the Claims IV, V, and VI hold. For any n ≥ r, <lb/>Σ has two boundary components C 0 and C 1 . Up to vertical translation, we can assume C 0 ⊂ ℍ n × {0} and C 1 ⊂ <lb/>ℍ n × {h * }. Up to horizontal translation we can assume that the center of C 0 coincides with the center of the disk <lb/>of Lemma 6.4. Moreover, by definition of h * , the radius of C 1 is smaller than 2𝜌 -. <lb/>Let R be the radius found in Claim V. By Claim V, (21) and Lemma 4.3 we get <lb/>R &gt; 𝓁(𝜌 * <lb/>H r -r ext , r ext ) &gt; 𝓁 <lb/>( <lb/>2𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>3 <lb/>, <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>3 <lb/>) <lb/>&gt; <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>6 <lb/>. <lb/>By Lemma 3.3, we can take Γ small enough such that <lb/>𝜌 * <lb/>H r <lb/>6 <lb/>&gt; <lb/>( 1 <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>+ 1 <lb/>) <lb/>𝜌 -, <lb/>where 𝛼 is the constant in (20). It follows that if Γ is small enough, then <lb/>R &gt; r ext + 𝜌 -&gt; 2𝜌 -. <lb/>(22) <lb/>Claim V and (22) allow us to translate Σ vertically in such a way that it is contained in W. By Lemma 6.4 and <lb/>the Maximum Principle, we can then translate Σ down until C 0 reaches ℍ n × {0} without having contact points <lb/>with the interior of M. Because of 𝜌 -&lt; r int , we can translate horizontally Σ in such a way that it touches every <lb/>point of Γ with C 0 and keeping C 0 inside Ω. <lb/>Since (22) holds true, during this translation C 1 remains inside the disk D * (R) ⊂ ℍ n × {h * }, which is the <lb/>reflection of D(R) ⊂ ℍ n × {h M -h * }. By Claim VI, in this process, the upper boundary of Σ does not touch M. <lb/>Recalling that the r-th mean curvature of Σ is not bigger than that of M, by the Maximum Principle, we get that <lb/>there can be no internal contact point between M and Σ. The claim then follows because Σ is a graph over the <lb/>exterior of D(𝜌 -). <lb/>□ <lb/>The proof of Theorem 6.1 is now complete. <lb/>□ <lb/>List of notations <lb/>We include a summary of the various notations we use throughout for the most notable objects and quantities. <lb/>(1) Profile curves: <lb/>𝜆 H r ,d r : function defining the profile curve of H r -hypersurfaces in ℍ n × ℝ invariant under rotation <lb/>depending on a real parameter d r (Section 2). <lb/></body>
