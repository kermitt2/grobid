Published by <lb/>BMJ. <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Background Closed-loop oxygen control systems <lb/>automatically adjust the fraction of inspired oxygen <lb/>(FiO 2 ) to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) within a <lb/>predetermined target range. Their performance with low <lb/>and high-flow oxygen therapies, but not with non-invasive <lb/>ventilation, has been established. We compared the effect <lb/>of automated oxygen on achieving and maintaining a <lb/>target SpO 2 range with nasal high flow (NHF), bilevel <lb/>positive airway pressure (bilevel) and continuous positive <lb/>airway pressure (CPAP), in stable hypoxaemic patients with <lb/>chronic cardiorespiratory disease. <lb/>Methods In this open-label, three-way cross-over <lb/>trial, participants with resting hypoxaemia (n=12) <lb/>received each of NHF, bilevel and CPAP treatments, <lb/>in random order, with automated oxygen titrated for <lb/>10 min, followed by 36 min of standardised manual <lb/>oxygen adjustments. The primary outcome was the <lb/>time taken to reach target SpO 2 range (92%-96%). <lb/>Secondary outcomes included time spent within target <lb/>range and physiological responses to automated and <lb/>manual oxygen adjustments. <lb/>Results Two participants were randomised to each of <lb/>six possible treatment orders. During automated oxygen <lb/>control (n=12), the mean (±SD) time to reach target <lb/>range was 114.8 (±87.9), 56.6 (±47.7) and 67.3 (±61) <lb/>seconds for NHF, bilevel and CPAP, respectively, mean <lb/>difference 58.3 (95% CI 25.0 to 91.5; p=0.002) and <lb/>47.5 (95% CI 14.3 to 80.7; p=0.007) seconds for bilevel <lb/>and CPAP versus NHF, respectively. Proportions of time <lb/>spent within target range were 68.5% (±16.3), 65.6% <lb/>(±28.7) and 74.7% (±22.6) for NHF, bilevel and CPAP, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>Manually increasing, then decreasing, the FiO 2 resulted <lb/>in similar increases and then decreases in SpO 2 and <lb/>transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtCO 2 ) with NHF, bilevel <lb/>and CPAP. <lb/>Conclusion The target SpO 2 range was achieved more <lb/>quickly when automated oxygen control was initiated with <lb/>bilevel and CPAP compared with NHF while time spent <lb/>within the range across the three therapies was similar. <lb/>Manually changing the FiO 2 had similar effects on SpO 2 <lb/>and PtCO 2 across each of the three therapies. <lb/>Trial registration number ACTRN12622000433707. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>In acutely unwell patients with hypoxia, <lb/>international guidelines recommend that <lb/>oxygen is titrated to a predetermined periph-<lb/>eral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) target. 1-3 This <lb/>targeted approach to oxygen delivery is poten-<lb/>tially advantageous to patients as it mitigates <lb/>the known harms of both hypoxaemia and <lb/>hyperoxaemia. 1 4 5 The current process for <lb/>delivering oxygen to an SpO 2 target range is <lb/>predominantly manual and is performed with <lb/></body>

        <front>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC <lb/>⇒ Automated oxygen control systems that titrate oxy-<lb/>gen to a target oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) range have <lb/>been developed for use with conventional low-flow <lb/>and nasal high-flow (NHF) oxygen therapies. Their <lb/>use with bilevel and continuous positive airway <lb/>pressure (CPAP) therapies in patients with cardiore-<lb/>spiratory disease is yet to be studied. <lb/>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS <lb/>⇒ In hypoxaemic participants with stable cardiorespi-<lb/>ratory disease, applying automated oxygen control <lb/>with bilevel and CPAP therapies took less time to <lb/>reach the target SpO 2 range than with NHF thera-<lb/>py while the time spent within the target range was <lb/>similar across each therapy. When manually adjust-<lb/>ing the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ) using <lb/>NHF, bilevel and CPAP; standardised increments and <lb/>decrements in the FiO 2 resulted in similar rises and <lb/>falls in SpO 2 and transcutaneous carbon dioxide lev-<lb/>els, respectively, across each of the three therapies. <lb/>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, <lb/>PRACTICE OR POLICY <lb/>⇒ These findings suggest that automated oxygen con-<lb/>trol systems with bilevel and CPAP are at least as <lb/>effective as NHF in achieving oxygen titration within <lb/>a target SpO 2 range when used in participants with <lb/>cardiopulmonary disease and are suitable for use <lb/>in those with acute respiratory failure who require <lb/>these therapies. <lb/>BMJ Open Respiratory Research: first published as 10.1136/bmjresp-2023-002196 on 18 June 2024.

        <body>variable accuracy between clinicians and across hospital <lb/>settings. In a standard medical ward, adjusting oxygen <lb/>manually appears suboptimal, with SpO 2 target range <lb/>maintained only around half the time. 6 This compares <lb/>to intensive care units (ICUs), where manually adjusted <lb/>oxygen under clinical trial conditions has been reported <lb/>to maintain SpO 2 within target range approximately 90% <lb/>of the time, 7 while in a cohort study, adherence to the <lb/>target SpO 2 range was achieved only 43% of the time. 8 <lb/>Novel automated oxygen control systems have been <lb/>developed, operating an algorithm-based closed-loop <lb/>controller that automatically titrates the delivered frac-<lb/>tional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) to main-<lb/>tain SpO 2 within a prespecified target range. The effect of <lb/>these automated oxygen control systems using both low-<lb/>flow and high-flow oxygen devices is to markedly improve <lb/>the efficacy of targeted oxygen delivery. 7 9-13 When trialled <lb/>in the emergency department and following abdominal <lb/>or thoracic surgery, automated low-flow oxygen systems <lb/>maintain target range saturation more effectively than <lb/>manual oxygen control. 10 11 Similarly, when used with <lb/>nasal high flow (NHF) in a standard medical ward and <lb/>in an ICU, 7 9 automated oxygen control improved adher-<lb/>ence to a prescribed saturation target range. <lb/>An automated oxygen control system integrated into <lb/>a non-invasive ventilation (NIV) device represents a <lb/>novel application of this technology, 14 that is, supported <lb/>by only one randomised trial in healthy volunteers. 15 <lb/>Further evidence is needed to characterise how auto-<lb/>mating oxygen delivery affects adherence to an SpO 2 <lb/>target range while using NIV therapy in participants with <lb/>underlying cardiopulmonary disease. <lb/>Accordingly, this trial examines a novel device (Airvo-3 <lb/>NIV with OptiO 2 , Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auck-<lb/>land, New Zealand) capable of automating oxygen <lb/>delivery across each of its three respiratory support plat-<lb/>forms: NHF, bilevel and continuous positive airway pres-<lb/>sure (CPAP). As each treatment modality influences the <lb/>respiratory system in a distinct way, generating different <lb/>conditions for ventilation and gas exchange, 16 it is neces-<lb/>sary to assess and compare the efficacy of automated <lb/>oxygen control using each mode. The main objective <lb/>of this study was to estimate the effect of initiating NHF, <lb/>bilevel and CPAP therapies while using automated oxygen <lb/>control on time taken to restore target range saturations <lb/>in adults with resting hypoxaemia. The hypothesis was <lb/>that the time taken for SpO 2 to come into range would <lb/>be shorter when used with bilevel and CPAP as compared <lb/>with NHF. Additionally, we aimed to characterise the <lb/>effect of manual changes in the FiO 2 with NHF, bilevel <lb/>and CPAP on SpO 2 and transcutaneous carbon dioxide <lb/>(PtCO 2 ). <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study design <lb/>This was an open-label, three-way cross-over, randomised <lb/>clinical trial undertaken at the Medical Research <lb/>Institute of New Zealand facility in Wellington Hospital. <lb/>A cross-over design was chosen for this study because the <lb/>within-patient variation is less than the between-patient <lb/>variation meaning fewer participants were required. <lb/>The three interventions (NHF, bilevel and CPAP) lasted <lb/>46 min each. Each 46 min intervention consisted of two <lb/>parts; first a 10 min period of automatically adjusted <lb/>oxygen where the target SpO 2 range was set to 92%-96%, <lb/>and second a 36 min period where the FiO 2 was adjusted <lb/>manually every 6 min in a standardised sequence as <lb/>follows: 0.21, 0.25, 0.32, 0.45, 0.25 and 0.21. A washout <lb/>period of at least 20 min occurred between each interven-<lb/>tion which has been shown to provide sufficient time for <lb/>SpO 2 and PtCO 2 to return to baseline 17 (figure 1). <lb/>This trial was registered with the Australian and New <lb/>Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12622000433707. <lb/>Patient and public involvement <lb/>The study design was reviewed and endorsed by the <lb/>Research Advisory Group-Māori (Māori Partnership <lb/>Board, Capital and Coast District Health Board, refer-<lb/>ence number RAG-M #927). <lb/>Participants <lb/>Participants were adults with stable respiratory or cardi-<lb/>ovascular disease and resting SpO 2 ≤90% while breathing <lb/>room air. Exclusion criteria were a contraindication <lb/>to NIV as per British Thoracic Society/Intensive Care <lb/>Society guidelines, 18 known infection or colonisation <lb/>with multidrug-resistant bacteria, SARS-CoV-2 infection, <lb/>pregnancy or any other condition believed to be a safety <lb/>risk (at investigators discretion). All participants gave <lb/>written informed consent. <lb/>Randomisation <lb/>Participants were randomised in equal proportions to <lb/>one of six possible orders to receive the three interven-<lb/>tions (a-b-c, a-c-b, b-a-c, b-c-a, c-a-b and c-b-a). The rando-<lb/>misation code was generated by the study statistician <lb/>using a computer-generated sequence. Allocation was <lb/>concealed by the SMART-TRIAL electronic case report <lb/>form and was released to investigators at the time of <lb/>randomisation. The nature of the intervention meant <lb/>participants could not be blinded to the allocated order <lb/>of the interventions. <lb/>Procedures <lb/>Participants attended a single visit. Resting SpO 2 was <lb/>recorded using a disposable finger probe pulse oximeter <lb/>(Nonin 7000A, Minnesota, USA), with a 10 min rolling <lb/>mean value used to assess eligibility. Forced expiratory <lb/>volume in 1 s and functional vital capacity were meas-<lb/>ured prior to the trial interventions (Easy on-PC, NDD <lb/>Medical Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). Spirometry <lb/>was performed according to American Thoracic Society/ <lb/>European Respiratory Society criteria. 19 <lb/></body>

        <body>Measurements of PtCO 2 , SpO 2 and heart rate (HR) <lb/>were captured using an ear probe sensor from a SenTec <lb/>(SenTec AG, Therwil (Basel), Switzerland) digital <lb/>monitor. Finger, cheek and forehead pulse oximeters <lb/>(Nonin) were also fitted to continuously monitor SpO 2 . <lb/>Blood pressure (BP) was monitored intermittently <lb/>(Mindray ePM 12, Shenzhen, China). <lb/>All participants then proceeded through the three <lb/>interventions in randomly allocated order as outlined <lb/>in figure 1. NHF was delivered using an AirSpiral heated <lb/>breathing tube (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare) and Opti-<lb/>flow+nasal cannula (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare) at 35 L/ <lb/>min flow, with an initial temperature of 37°C. Bilevel <lb/>was applied in spontaneous-timed mode using a Nivairo <lb/>(Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare) full face mask, with inspi-<lb/>ratory positive airway pressure 15 cmH 2 0, expiratory <lb/>positive airway pressure 5 cmH 2 0, minimum inspira-<lb/>tory time 1.0 s, backup respiratory rate (RR) 12 and an <lb/>initial temperature of 27°C. CPAP was applied using a <lb/>Nivairo full face mask, with 10 cmH 2 0 CPAP and an initial <lb/>temperature of 27°C. <lb/>During the first 10 min automated oxygen control <lb/>part of each intervention, the SpO 2 target range was set <lb/>at 92%-96%. It was deemed by the trial management <lb/>committee that even though a saturation target range of <lb/>88%-92% may be more physiologically appropriate for <lb/>the study population, the effect of the automated oxygen <lb/>control system would be best observed with a range of <lb/>92%-96% and potential transient exposure to SpO 2 levels <lb/>above the upper limit while under strict observation was <lb/>considered acceptable. <lb/>Outcomes <lb/>The study&apos;s primary outcome was the mean (±SD) time <lb/>taken for the SpO 2 to reach target range, of between <lb/>92% and 96% while using the automated oxygen control <lb/>system. This was defined as the time (in seconds) between <lb/>Figure 1 Schematic representation of study procedures. a Continuous measurements include: Transcutaneous carbon <lb/>dioxide (PtCO 2 ; SenTec), peripheral saturation of oxygen (SpO 2 ; Nonin 7000A and SenTec), heart rate (Nonin) and respiratory <lb/>rate (Airvo-3 NIV).

        <body>activating the Airvo-3 device to deliver NHF, bilevel or <lb/>CPAP therapy, and the first moment when the partici-<lb/>pants SpO 2 was ≥92%. <lb/>Secondary outcomes included the time taken to reach <lb/>target range compared across the three modes of respira-<lb/>tory support, the proportion of time spent within target <lb/>range and the time course of SpO 2 , FiO 2 and transcuta-<lb/>neous carbon dioxide (PtCO 2 ) during the 10 min period <lb/>of the automated oxygen control using each mode <lb/>of therapy. Additional secondary outcomes included <lb/>maximum, minimum and median SpO 2 , HR, RR, BP <lb/>and PtCO 2 over each 6 min interval during the manual <lb/>FiO 2 ramp phase, as well as the mean difference in SpO 2 <lb/>between the finger probe pulse oximeter and ear-lobe <lb/>oximeters (together with limits of agreement) at the <lb/>beginning of the NHF intervention. <lb/>Sample size <lb/>At the time of study design, an estimate of paired SD for <lb/>time-to-target-range was not available and so the study <lb/>sample size was based on having reasonable precision to <lb/>estimate mean time-to-target range. This was based on <lb/>a known mean and SD for single treatment time-target <lb/>range of 120 and 24 s, respectively. A sample size of 12 <lb/>allows for a 95% CI for a single modality of treatment <lb/>time-to-target range of plus or minus 20 s. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>For the primary outcome variable, a linear mixed <lb/>model was used to compare the three treatments, <lb/>with participant treated as a random effect to account <lb/>for the same participants being measured three times, <lb/>and order of treatment and treatment modality as <lb/>fixed effects. Similar linear mixed models were used <lb/>to compare percentage of time in, below and above <lb/>target SpO 2 range. PtCO 2 was also compared between <lb/>treatments using a linear model, with baseline PtCO 2 <lb/>as an additional fixed effect. The time course of phys-<lb/>iological variables is shown graphically as scatter plots <lb/>of raw and paired data with locally estimated scatter <lb/>plot smoother and approximate 95% CI. <lb/>For the secondary outcome variables of HR, systolic BP <lb/>(SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and RR, a linear mixed model <lb/>was used to compare the three treatments, with partici-<lb/>pant treated as a random effect to account for the same <lb/>participants being measured three times, and order of <lb/>treatment and treatment modality as fixed effects. <lb/>Agreement between pulse oximeters was compared <lb/>using the NHF data, by linear mixed model with fixed <lb/>effects for the type of pulse oximeter and random effects <lb/>for both participant and algorithm step. The mean differ-<lb/>ence between pulse oximeters was tested for evidence of <lb/>bias and limits of agreement were estimated by two times <lb/>the square root of the residual variance in the linear <lb/>mixed model. Physiological variables across the 6 min <lb/>intervals of the FiO 2 manual ramp phase are presented <lb/>as mean and standard deviation (±SD) and median and <lb/>IQR and minimum to maximum. <lb/>SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute) was used. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Participants were recruited between 7 April 2022 and <lb/>27 July 2022. 14 participants were screened for the trial <lb/>with 2 subjects excluded because of a baseline SpO 2 &gt;90% <lb/>(figure 2). The 12 participants who completed the trial <lb/>comprised of 7 females and 5 males, with the preva-<lb/>lence of active cardiorespiratory diagnoses distributed as <lb/>follows; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10/12), <lb/>heart failure (7/12), obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) <lb/>(3/12), OSA/obesity hypoventilation syndrome (2/12), <lb/>diffuse parenchymal lung disease (2/12), bronchiec-<lb/>tasis (1/12). 10 participants were prescribed long-term <lb/>oxygen therapy, and three participants were prescribed <lb/>nocturnal positive airway pressure therapy (bilevel or <lb/>CPAP) (table 1). Two participants were randomised to <lb/>each of the six potential treatment orders. <lb/>Automated oxygen control period <lb/>The mean (±SD) time to reach target SpO2 was 114.8 <lb/>(±87.9), 56.6 (±47.7) and 67.3 (±61) seconds for NHF, <lb/>bilevel and CPAP, respectively, with a mean difference <lb/>(95% CI) of 58.3 s (25.0 to 91.5), p=0.002; and 47.5 s <lb/>(14.3 to 80.7), p=0.007; for bilevel and CPAP versus NHF, <lb/>respectively (table 2). The trajectories of the SpO 2 plots <lb/>for bilevel and CPAP immediately separated from that <lb/>of NHF and tracked almost identically across the 10 min <lb/>period of automated oxygen control (figure 3A). As the <lb/>SpO 2 plots tracked into target range, the corresponding <lb/>FiO 2 plot shows different FiO 2 trajectories by therapy, <lb/>with a gradual increase while using NHF and a gradual <lb/>decrease while using bilevel and CPAP (figure 3B). <lb/>Secondary outcomes relevant to the 10 min automated <lb/>oxygen control period include reduced time spent below <lb/>SpO 2 target range for both bilevel and CPAP when <lb/>compared with NHF, increased time spent above range <lb/>for bilevel compared with NHF, no significant difference <lb/>in time spent above range comparing CPAP and NHF, <lb/>and no significant differences in time spent within range <lb/>across all three treatments (table 2). The magnitude of <lb/>increase in SpO 2 during the automated oxygen control <lb/>period varied between individuals; with some over-<lb/>shooting the 96% upper limit of the SpO 2 target range. <lb/>Line plots of SpO 2 and FiO 2 by individual show that at <lb/>times where the SpO 2 increased above 96%, the FiO 2 <lb/>delivered by the closed-loop oxygen controller was at or <lb/>near 0.21 (see online supplemental figure S1-S9). <lb/>PtCO 2 trended downward over the 10 min automated <lb/>oxygen period as participants were initiated on bilevel <lb/>while remaining near constant in participants receiving <lb/>NHF or CPAP (online supplemental table S1, figure 3C). <lb/>Manual oxygen adjustment periods <lb/>Over each 6 min step during all three treatments, manual <lb/>sequential FiO 2 increments and decrements were <lb/></body>

The mean (95% CI) <lb/>difference was -1.90% (-2.28% to -1.51%), p&lt;0.0001 <lb/>and limits of agreement -4.17% to 0.37% (see online <lb/>supplemental figure S10). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In participants with advanced cardiorespiratory disease <lb/>and resting hypoxaemia, SpO 2 increased to within the <lb/>target SpO 2 range more quickly when initiating the <lb/>OptiO 2 automated oxygen control system with bilevel <lb/>and CPAP than with NHF. The more rapid restoration of <lb/>target saturation range meant that the proportion of time <lb/>when SpO 2 was below target range was less for CPAP and <lb/>bilevel, than NHF. These findings align with the known <lb/>effects of initiating bilevel and CPAP therapies, whereby <lb/>the positive airway pressure promptly increases above <lb/>what can be achieved with NHF, 17 20 resulting in a more <lb/>rapid improvement in gas exchange. Over the 10 min <lb/>automated oxygen control period, time spent within <lb/>the target SpO 2 range using each mode of therapy was <lb/>not different, suggesting that automated oxygen control <lb/>systems with bilevel and CPAP are at least as effective as <lb/>with NHF. <lb/>The average increase in SpO 2 from baseline was greater <lb/>when initiating the OptiO 2 system with bilevel and CPAP, <lb/>compared with NHF. In some individuals, the rise in SpO 2 <lb/>was more pronounced, breaching the 96% upper limit of <lb/>the SpO 2 target range. When tracking the time course of <lb/>SpO 2 and FiO 2 by individual participant over the auto-<lb/>mated oxygen control period, it appears that on each <lb/>occasion when SpO 2 exceeded 96%, the delivered FiO 2 <lb/>was at, or close to 0.21, meaning that this level of oxygen-<lb/>ation was likely achieved because of improved pulmonary <lb/>mechanics and gas exchange imparted by pressure or <lb/>flow therapies, 16 17 20-24 rather than an automated oxygen <lb/>Table 2 Automated oxygen control period-time taken to reach SpO 2 target range, and time spent below, above and within <lb/>range <lb/>Time (seconds) for SpO 2 to come within target range <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (±SD) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>NHF <lb/>12 <lb/>114.8 (87.9) <lb/>101 (48-169) <lb/>Bilevel <lb/>12 <lb/>56.6 (47.7) <lb/>43.5 (23-86.5) <lb/>CPAP <lb/>12 <lb/>67.3 (61) <lb/>41 (24-118.5) <lb/>Comparison <lb/>Estimate (95% CI) <lb/>P value <lb/>NHF minus bilevel <lb/>58.25 (25.03 to 91.47) <lb/>0.002 <lb/>NHF minus CPAP <lb/>47.50 (14.28 to 80.72) <lb/>0.007 <lb/>Time SpO 2 below range (%) <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (±SD) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>NHF <lb/>12 <lb/>28.4 (16.7) <lb/>26.3 (13.2-44.1) <lb/>Bilevel <lb/>12 <lb/>12.4 (9.3) <lb/>11.3 (6-16.7) <lb/>CPAP <lb/>12 <lb/>13.6 (10.8) <lb/>9.2 (5.2-23.1) <lb/>Comparison <lb/>Estimate (95% CI) <lb/>P value <lb/>NHF minus bilevel <lb/>16.00 (8.87 to 23.14) <lb/>0.0001 <lb/>NHF minus CPAP <lb/>14.76 (7.63 to 21.90) <lb/>0.0003 <lb/>Time SpO 2 above range (%) <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (±SD) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>NHF <lb/>12 <lb/>3.2 (5.5) <lb/>0.3 (0-4.5) <lb/>Bilevel <lb/>12 <lb/>22.8 (28.4) <lb/>11.5 (0.5-46.1) <lb/>CPAP <lb/>12 <lb/>12.4 (17.3) <lb/>2.4 (0-23.1) <lb/>Comparison <lb/>Estimate (95% CI) <lb/>P value <lb/>NHF minus bilevel <lb/>-19.62 (-32.73 to -6.51) <lb/>0.005 <lb/>NHF minus CPAP <lb/>-9.16 (-22.28 to 3.95) <lb/>0.16 <lb/>Time SpO 2 in range (%) <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (±SD) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>NHF <lb/>12 <lb/>68.5 (16.3) <lb/>69.4 (56.4-85.7) <lb/>Bilevel <lb/>12 <lb/>65.6 (28.7) <lb/>76.9 (44.5-82.6) <lb/>CPAP <lb/>12 <lb/>74.7 (22.6) <lb/>81 (61.3-92.8) <lb/>Comparison <lb/>Estimate (95% CI) <lb/>P value <lb/>NHF minus bilevel <lb/>2.91 (-12.65 to 18.46) <lb/>0.70 <lb/>NHF minus CPAP <lb/>-6.12 (-21.67 to 9.44) <lb/>0.42 <lb/>Bilevel, bilevel positive airway pressure; CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure; NHF, nasal high flow; SpO 2 , peripheral oxygen saturation. <lb/></body>

        <body>ventilatory effects of each therapy, with bilevel providing <lb/>pressure support to directly increase alveolar ventila-<lb/>tion 25 and with the positive end-expiratory pressure <lb/>generated by CPAP and NHF having only a minor and <lb/>indirect impact on ventilation. 16 For all three thera-<lb/>pies, as participants progressed into the manual FiO 2 <lb/>adjustment periods, PtCO 2 trended upward as the FiO 2 <lb/>was stepped up to 0.45. This may be a consequence of <lb/>hyperoxaemia-induced hypercapnia, 21 26 27 a phenomena <lb/>that arises from a transient reduction in ventilatory <lb/>drive, with a sustained rise in arterial carbon dioxide, 28 <lb/>as well as reversal of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction <lb/>resulting in increased dead space. 29 30 Notably, excessive <lb/>oxygenation in critically unwell patients using bilevel <lb/>NIV has previously been reported to have no significant <lb/>effect on arterial carbon dioxide, minute ventilation <lb/>and dead space 31 so our contrary finding that PtCO 2 <lb/>trended upward when participants received escalating <lb/>oxygen concentrations with bilevel NIV requires further <lb/>exploration. <lb/>To our knowledge, this is the first trial of its kind <lb/>whereby an automated oxygen control system was tested <lb/>across multiple respiratory support treatments in chronic <lb/>cardiopulmonary disease, broadening the clinical situ-<lb/>ations in which this technology has been successfully <lb/>applied. Moreover, this trial examined the efficacy of <lb/>the automated oxygen control system by restoration of <lb/>normoxaemia in resting patients with baseline hypox-<lb/>aemia, rather than the more conventional approach of <lb/>assessing how the automated oxygen controller responds <lb/>to exercise-induced hypoxaemia. 15 32-34 This allowed for <lb/>simultaneous evaluation of the FiO 2 controller&apos;s response <lb/>to hypoxaemia under therapy-specific pressure and flow <lb/>conditions, as well as to high SpO 2 values that were driven <lb/>above the 96% upper limit of the target range by applica-<lb/>tion of respiratory support. <lb/>While this trial captures favourable performance <lb/>characteristics of the automated oxygen control system, <lb/>the static nature of the testing and short 10 min testing <lb/>period of the automated oxygen control function limits <lb/>the applicability of the findings, as real-life situations <lb/>where the Airvo-3 NIV device with OptiO 2 might best be <lb/>used may pose more pronounced and enduring periods <lb/>of hypoxaemia or hyperoxaemia. 6 While participants <lb/>received automated oxygen control, a single SpO 2 range <lb/>of 92%-96% was targeted so our findings may not be <lb/>generalisable to other target ranges. Additionally, when <lb/>participants received manual oxygen control, stepwise <lb/>changes in FiO 2 were made at 6 min intervals, which does <lb/>not reflect real-world clinician-initiated oxygen adjust-<lb/>ment. Further studies in acutely unwell hypoxaemic <lb/>patients, over longer durations, with different target <lb/>SpO 2 ranges are required to understand the effects of <lb/>automated oxygen control systems under acute care <lb/>conditions. <lb/>A recent trial reports that automated oxygen control <lb/>using low-flow oxygen is likely to improve endurance <lb/>capacity and dyspnoea scores compared with manually <lb/>adjusted oxygen, with no additional benefit from the use <lb/>of automated oxygen control with NHF. 35 A limitation <lb/>of our trial was that participants were at rest throughout <lb/>the entirety of the intervention so an assessment of exer-<lb/>tional breathlessness and endurance capacity while using <lb/>NHF, bilevel and CPAP, in automated oxygen control <lb/>mode was not appropriate. Additionally, our trial did not <lb/>directly compare automated and manual oxygen control <lb/>on the time taken to reach, or the time spent within, the <lb/>target SpO 2 range. <lb/>Measurement bias was observed between the Nonin <lb/>finger and Sentec ear-lobe pulse oximeters. In this study, <lb/>the limits of agreement with gold-standard arterial SpO2 <lb/>(%SaO 2 ) could not be assessed, as no arterial blood gas <lb/>sampling was performed, but given the relatively wide <lb/>limits of agreement measured (-4.17 to 0.37), errors <lb/>in SaO 2 approximation according to oximeter site and <lb/>brand are likely to significantly influence accuracy of the <lb/>automated oxygen control system. Further exploration of <lb/>patient variables that influence pulse oximetry, as well as <lb/>characterisation of brand-specific oximeter performance <lb/>are required so that automated oxygen control systems <lb/>can more accurately maintain target SpO2. <lb/>While there were distinct differences in the performance <lb/>of the OptiO 2 automated oxygen control system across the <lb/>NHF, bilevel and CPAP interventions, the findings of this <lb/>trial indicate that this system is highly effective at maintaining <lb/>SpO2 within target range across each of the tested treatment <lb/>platforms. Based on these findings, clinical trials of its use <lb/>in acute care in patients with respiratory failure requiring <lb/>bilevel and/or CPAP are indicated. <lb/></body>
