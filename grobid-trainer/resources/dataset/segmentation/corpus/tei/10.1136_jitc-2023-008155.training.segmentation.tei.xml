Published by <lb/>BMJ. <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Objective To identify determinants of the utilisation of <lb/>ophthalmic clinical health services among students who <lb/>failed school vision screening. <lb/>Methods This study employed a sequential explanatory <lb/>mixed methods design, underpinned by Andersen&apos;s <lb/>Behavioural Model of Health Service Utilisation. Data <lb/>were initially gathered through interviews with 27 <lb/>stakeholders-comprising 5 ophthalmologists, 7 <lb/>community doctors, 7 public health professionals <lb/>and 8 teachers. The qualitative insights informed the <lb/>construction of a questionnaire, which subsequently <lb/>garnered responses from 6215 participants. Qualitative <lb/>data underwent thematic analysis with NVivo V.12, while <lb/>quantitative data were analysed using multivariable <lb/>multinomial logistic regression in SAS V.9.4. Data <lb/>integration was performed using the Pillar Integration <lb/>Process for a deductive, evidence-based synthesis of <lb/>findings. <lb/>Results The research revealed that students <lb/>attending vision demonstration schools and receiving <lb/>encouragement from schools or communities to access <lb/>clinical ophthalmic services demonstrated higher <lb/>adherence to referral (OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.12; <lb/>OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.80). Conversely, older students <lb/>and those from higher-income families exhibited lower <lb/>adherence rates (OR=0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44; OR=0.34, <lb/>95% CI 0.25 to 0.46). Moreover, students with less urgent <lb/>medical needs were more likely to adhere to referrals <lb/>compared with those needing immediate referrals <lb/>(OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45). <lb/>Four pillars emerged: (a) adherence decreased with age, <lb/>(b) financial constraints did not pose an obstacle, (c) public <lb/>health services played a critical role, (d) referral urgency <lb/>did not linearly correlate with adherence. <lb/>Conclusion The utilisation of ophthalmic clinical health <lb/>services following vision screening failure in students is <lb/>significantly influenced by public health services provided <lb/>by schools or communities, such as prompting those with <lb/>abnormal screening results to access ophthalmic clinical <lb/>health services. <lb/></front>

        <body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>An estimated 1 billion cases of impaired vision <lb/>or blindness out of 2.2 billion individuals <lb/>could have been prevented or ameliorated <lb/>but not handled. 1 Vision impairment and <lb/>blindness in children adversely impact their <lb/>health, educational outcomes and future <lb/>prospects. 2 The omission of early diagnosis <lb/>and intervention in paediatric popula-<lb/>tions can result in irreversible vision loss or <lb/></body>

        <front>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC <lb/>⇒ Students who failed the school vision screening are <lb/>mandated to pursue further assessment at a desig-<lb/>nated. Despite annual recommendations, adherence <lb/>rate remains low. <lb/>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS <lb/>⇒ Public health services were the primary determi-<lb/>nants of referral adherence among students failing <lb/>vision screenings, beyond sociodemographic char-<lb/>acteristics such as age and family income, and per-<lb/>ceived personal need. <lb/>⇒ Vision demonstration schools exhibited significantly <lb/>higher adherence rates than other schools, and the <lb/>active encouragement from schools or communities <lb/>to adhere was a key factor in the utilisation of oph-<lb/>thalmic clinical health services. <lb/>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, <lb/>PRACTICE OR POLICY <lb/>⇒ The determinants of individual clinical health service <lb/>utilisation were multifaceted, with prior research <lb/>focusing predominantly on sociodemographic fac-<lb/>tors and the availability and accessibility of clinical <lb/>medical resources, often overlooking the influence <lb/>of public health entities and their services. Further <lb/>investigation in this area was warranted. <lb/>⇒ Similar to other health service utilisation surveys, <lb/>investigations into ophthalmic clinical health ser-<lb/>vice use among students with failed school vision <lb/>screenings lacked standardised questionnaires and <lb/>methodologies. However, employing the Andersen&apos;s <lb/>Model, incorporating mixed methods with both <lb/>quantitative and qualitative analysis, and synthesis-<lb/>ing conclusions using the Pillar Integration Process <lb/>were proven to be scientifically effective. <lb/></front>

        <body>blindness. 3 Visual impairment manifests as a significant <lb/>public health issue within developing nations, further <lb/>compounded by insufficient healthcare services. 4 Never-<lb/>theless, school-based eye care initiatives hold promise <lb/>for delivering high-quality, cost-effective visual health <lb/>services. 5 The efficacy of vision screening programmes <lb/>hinges on comprehensive follow-up care. 6 <lb/>In China, the lack of a standardised national protocol <lb/>for vision screening and an established referral system <lb/>has been noted. 7 Often, children identified in vision <lb/>screenings are asymptomatic or in early stages, thus <lb/>post-screening clinical follow-up rates are often low. 8 To <lb/>improve compliance with clinical ophthalmic services <lb/>post-screening, it is crucial to identify the underlying <lb/>factors contributing to the persistently low adherence <lb/>rates. Decision-making regarding medical consultations <lb/>or treatments is intricate. 9 The Andersen&apos;s Model, estab-<lb/>lished to elucidate healthcare access and utilisation, 10 <lb/>suggests that a convergence of predisposing characteris-<lb/>tics, enabling resources and need factors drives health-<lb/>care usage. 11 Contemporary research into post-vision <lb/>screening compliance in children is limited, 12 with <lb/>existing studies primarily focusing on parental 13 and <lb/>healthcare system 14 determinants. <lb/>Health services research demands the examination of <lb/>multifaceted and multilevel systems, often necessitating <lb/>both quantitative and qualitative data. 15 Therefore, this <lb/>study employs mixed methods to investigate the compre-<lb/>hensive determinants-spanning individual, familial, <lb/>educational and healthcare-related factors-that influ-<lb/>ence the utilisation of ophthalmic services following <lb/>school-based vision screenings, anchored by Andersen&apos;s <lb/>Model as the theoretical underpinning. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study design <lb/>This research was conducted using a mixed-methods <lb/>framework, incorporating both qualitative (individual <lb/>in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) and <lb/>quantitative (survey) methodologies. Mixed methods <lb/>research synergistically combines the empirical precision <lb/>of quantitative data with the nuanced context of qualita-<lb/>tive insights, offering a robust approach for investigating <lb/>complex healthcare systems and deepening the analysis <lb/>in health services research. 16 <lb/>This study used a two-phase sequential explanatory <lb/>mixed-methods approach, beginning with qualitative <lb/>interviews to guide the creation of a quantitative survey <lb/>in the absence of a pre-existing instrument for post-vision <lb/>screening ophthalmic service utilisation. Subsequently, <lb/>the survey was deployed to test hypotheses and achieve <lb/>research goals. This process effectively merges qualitative <lb/>insights with quantitative rigour, achieving a comprehen-<lb/>sive methodological integration. 17 <lb/>Our study employed the validated mixed-method joint <lb/>display technique known as the Pillar Integration Process <lb/>(PIP) to effectively integrate quantitative and qualitative <lb/>data, which was pivotal in deriving conclusions. The PIP <lb/>consists of four stages-Listing, Matching, Checking <lb/>and Pillar Building-to systematically reveal emergent <lb/>themes. 18 <lb/>Phase 1 <lb/>The study employed purposive sampling to select inter-<lb/>viewees, such as ophthalmologists, community and public <lb/>health centre physicians, and educators. <lb/>All included participants play crucial roles in the school <lb/>eye health programmes. Teachers inform students and <lb/>parents before the screening, providing student details <lb/>to community physicians who carry out vision screenings <lb/>at the school. Subsequently, the physicians send results <lb/>and referral notifications to the school. Teachers commu-<lb/>nicate results to students and parents, issuing referrals <lb/>as necessary. Referred students and parents proceed <lb/>to designated hospitals for further examinations, with <lb/>ophthalmologists recording and notifying outcomes to <lb/>community hospitals. Following this, community physi-<lb/>cians input follow-up data into Shanghai child and adoles-<lb/>cent visual development records while public health <lb/>physicians oversee database management and workflow <lb/>coordination. <lb/>Participants must have at least 3 years of experience <lb/>in their field, be actively involved in the management <lb/>of eye health, and voluntarily participate. Data collec-<lb/>tion would be stopped, and interviews would be ended <lb/>once thematic saturation is achieved. Focus group <lb/>sessions were hosted at Disease Prevention and Control <lb/>Centres, while offline individual interviews took place <lb/>at the informant&apos;s hospital. Online individual interviews <lb/>were conducted via telephone. All participants provided <lb/>informed consent prior to the interview, including the <lb/>permission to be audio-recorded. <lb/>Phase 2 <lb/>Teachers facilitated electronic questionnaires, which <lb/>parents completed under supervision. This study has <lb/>obtained consent from the guardians of the research <lb/>subjects. Collected data were cross-referenced with the <lb/>Minhang district&apos;s child and adolescent visual develop-<lb/>ment records in Shanghai, encompassing comprehen-<lb/>sive demographic and ophthalmological assessment <lb/>outcomes and physician&apos;s advisement. Analysis identi-<lb/>fied students failing school vision screenings and recom-<lb/>mended for referrals. Utilisation patterns of ophthalmic <lb/>services among these students were investigated, differ-<lb/>entiating between compliant and non-compliant groups. <lb/>To discern factors influencing ophthalmic service usage, <lb/>analytical variables were systematically categorised using <lb/>the Andersen Model. <lb/>Study population <lb/>Figure 1 shows that in phase 1, the sample comprised 27 <lb/>informants. In phase 2, a total of 15 615 students were <lb/>surveyed by questionnaire, of whom 3535 were excluded <lb/>due to the unavailability of screening records, while 210 <lb/></body>

        <body>were omitted due to duplication, incomplete or aberrant <lb/>data entries. Hence, the dropout rate for this study was <lb/>24.0% (3745/15 615). Among those remaining, 6215 out <lb/>of 11 870 (52.36%) were recommended for referral, and <lb/>a total of 6215 students were finally included in the study. <lb/>Statistical analyses <lb/>Phase 1: qualitative thematic analysis <lb/>All the interviews were recorded and transcribed. A <lb/>thematic analysis was used to systematically code and <lb/>analyse transcribed interviews through NVivo V.12. <lb/>Analysis themes <lb/>The interviews adhered to a semi-structured format <lb/>designed to meet the objectives of the project. The <lb/>guiding framework included sections on: (a) existing <lb/>practices in children&apos;s vision health, encompassing <lb/>screening and referral processes; (b) regional adherence <lb/>following school vision screening; (c) implications for <lb/>health service demand; and (d) potential strategies to <lb/>enhance adherence rate. The 21 items checklist from the <lb/>Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research was used to <lb/>inform the qualitative approach of the research. <lb/>Phase 2: quantitative variable analysis <lb/>Analysis was conducted using SAS software (V.9.4). We <lb/>summarised descriptive statistics as counts (n) and <lb/>proportions (%). Distributional disparities in compli-<lb/>ance were evaluated using the χ 2 test or Fisher&apos;s exact <lb/>test, as appropriate. Influencing factors were examined <lb/>across three separate multivariate multinomial logistic <lb/>regression models. Model 1 exclusively incorporated <lb/>predisposing factors, while model 2 added an enabling <lb/>factor. Model 3 was comprehensive, assimilating predis-<lb/>posing, enabling and an additional need factor for anal-<lb/>ysis. Results are presented as ORs with 95% CIs and asso-<lb/>ciated p values. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05 <lb/>with two-tailed tests. <lb/>Analysis variables <lb/>The quantitative survey data were analysed using Ander-<lb/>sen&apos;s Behavioural Model, encompassing predisposing, <lb/>enabling and need factors. 19 <lb/>Dependent variable <lb/>In this analysis, adherence to referral was the dependent <lb/>variable classified into compliant and non-compliant <lb/>groups. Compliance was defined as having sought <lb/>ophthalmic evaluation at least once following a screening <lb/>failure in 2020, with attendance records maintained in <lb/>the database. Children lost to follow-up were considered <lb/>non-compliant. The adherence rate was calculated as <lb/>the number of patients for whom the conclusions of the <lb/>ophthalmologist were received from the screening insti-<lb/>tution divided by the number of referred patients. <lb/>Independent variables <lb/>Predisposing factors encompass demographic characteris-<lb/>tics and social structure elements relevant to healthcare <lb/>utilisation. 20 In this study, predisposing factors included <lb/>age, gender, ethnicity, indigenous habitats and parental <lb/>occupations. <lb/>Enabling factors are conditions that facilitate the reduc-<lb/>tion of financial and structural obstacles to health-<lb/>care access. 20 In this investigation, the enabling factors <lb/>encompassed the annual family income, vision demon-<lb/>stration school, and the public health services provided <lb/>by schools or community hospitals. Family income (per <lb/>year) was categorised into &apos;low income&apos; (less than ¥100 <lb/>000), &apos;lower middle income&apos; (¥100 000-¥300 000), <lb/>&apos;upper middle income&apos; (¥300 000-¥500 000) and &apos;high <lb/>income&apos; (¥≥500 000) according to the local economic <lb/>level. <lb/>Need factors pertain to individuals&apos; subjective health-<lb/>care necessities and personal health perception. 21 As the <lb/>questionnaire responses were provided by parents, direct <lb/>Figure 1 Overview of study population and data integration. <lb/></body>

        <body>assessment of students&apos; self-evaluated referral needs and <lb/>health perceptions was infeasible. Objectively, the study <lb/>used referrals determined by community doctors, based <lb/>on vision screening outcomes, as a proxy for evaluating <lb/>students&apos; referral requirements. Visual health status was <lb/>stratified into four categories reflecting the urgency of <lb/>impairment: (a) routine, (b) urgent, (c) emergency and <lb/>(d) immediate referral. The specific criteria for these <lb/>classifications are detailed in online supplemental table <lb/>S1. <lb/>Data integration <lb/>In our study, the first column delineated discrete sections <lb/>of the questionnaire under investigation. Subsequent <lb/>questionnaire outcomes were enumerated in the second <lb/>column. The Matching stage involved columns four and <lb/>five, where qualitative insights and coding were synchro-<lb/>nised with the quantitative data from column two. A <lb/>comparative analysis of the data across columns two, <lb/>four and five was then conducted to unveil patterns of <lb/>congruence, culminating in the Pillar Building stage, <lb/>where synthesised inferences were consolidated in the <lb/>third column as foundational themes. 22 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Qualitative findings <lb/>Twenty-two informants engaged in two focus groups, <lb/>two underwent face-to-face in-depth interviews at their <lb/>respective hospitals, and another three were interviewed <lb/>via telephone. The qualitative interviews predominantly <lb/>featured female informants, comprising 85.2% (n=23) <lb/>of participants. The predominant share of the cohort <lb/>possesses senior professional designations. <lb/>Seven themes were identified, including referral <lb/>criteria, adherence rates, workflow, recording and feed-<lb/>back of outcomes, medical resources, health service <lb/>capacity and medical fees. <lb/>Quantitative findings <lb/>Characteristics of respondents <lb/>The overall screening yielded a referral rate of 52.4%. <lb/>Among the students recommended for referral, only <lb/>16.8% used ophthalmic clinical health services. Table 1 <lb/>details the demographic profiles of the respondents. A <lb/>majority (72.7%) were enrolled in primary schools, ages <lb/>7-11. The gender distribution was nearly even, with boys <lb/>constituting 51.6%, and a significant majority, 96.7% <lb/>(n=6011), were of Han ethnicity, with 41.6% (n=2584) <lb/>identifying as indigenous residents. Approximately <lb/>half reported a family income within the &apos;lower-middle <lb/>income&apos; bracket. The parents of around two-thirds of <lb/>the participants were in professional or managerial roles. <lb/>Only a small fraction, 7.5%, attended vision demonstra-<lb/>tion schools. About 95% of respondents had received <lb/>formal screening notification, eye health education and <lb/>results disclosure provided by schools or community <lb/>hospitals. Furthermore, 60.5% were notified to pursue <lb/>referrals. Among those referred, 49.5% required routine <lb/>referral, while 35.5% necessitated an emergency referral. <lb/>Sex, ethnicity and status as indigenous residents were <lb/>not determinative factors in the utilisation of ophthalmic <lb/>clinical health services. Students with parents employed <lb/>in physical labour and those enrolled in vision demon-<lb/>stration schools exhibited higher adherence rates. As <lb/>family annual income increased, the adherence rate <lb/>decreased (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, the public health <lb/>services rendered by school or local communities, along-<lb/>side the urgency of referrals, were influential parameters <lb/>in the referral process. <lb/>Factors associated with compliance <lb/>Table 2 delineates the ORs ascertained from both bivar-<lb/>iate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The <lb/>results demonstrated a negative correlation between <lb/>age and service adherence. The likelihood of adherence <lb/>was higher among students whose parents were engaged <lb/>in service/labour sectors relative. Enrolment in vision <lb/>demonstration schools significantly increased the likeli-<lb/>hood of adherence to referrals. Interestingly, adherence <lb/>was inversely related to family annual income. Notifica-<lb/>tion of vision screening from schools or communities, <lb/>along with health education and adherence reminders, <lb/>significantly influenced the likelihood of referral compli-<lb/>ance. Compared with students requiring emergency <lb/>referrals, those necessitating urgent referrals exhibited <lb/>an increased likelihood of attending clinical visits. <lb/>The comprehensive model demonstrated that students <lb/>enrolled in vision demonstration schools and who <lb/>Variable <lb/>Total (N=6215) Non-compliant (N=5171, 83.20%) Compliant (N=1044, 16.80%) P value <lb/>Yes <lb/>3758 (60.5) <lb/>3020 (80.4) <lb/>738 (19.6) <lb/>Need factor <lb/>Referral urgency <lb/>&lt;0.001 <lb/>Immediate referral <lb/>603 (9.7) <lb/>520 (86.2) <lb/>83 (13.8) <lb/>Emergency referral <lb/>2206 (35.5) <lb/>1829 (82.9) <lb/>377 (17.1) <lb/>Urgent referral <lb/>328 (5.3) <lb/>259 (79.0) <lb/>69 (21.0) <lb/>Routine referral <lb/>3078 (49.5) <lb/>2563 (83.3) <lb/>515 (16.7) <lb/>Table 1 Continued <lb/></body>

        <body>role, (d) referral urgency did not linearly correlate with <lb/>adherence. Table 3 illustrates the integration of the find-<lb/>ings and the resulting pillars. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study employed Andersen&apos;s Model to investigate <lb/>the characteristics of students who adhere to referral <lb/>posting school vision screening. The study disclosed an <lb/>overall adherence rate of 16.80%. The prevalence of <lb/>visual impairment among students in Shanghai is on a <lb/>continuous rise. 23 Our study&apos;s referral rate was high at <lb/>60%, surpassing rates observed in Australia (10%), 24 <lb/>Canada (32.2%), 25 Germany (27%), 26 New Zealand <lb/>(14%). 27 However, the adherence rate in our setting <lb/>was markedly lower than in Israel (54.3%), 13 Canada <lb/>(69.9%) 25 and Yunnan Province, China (37.4%). 7 Vision <lb/>screening, a pivotal public health intervention, is aimed <lb/>at the early detection of high-risk individuals and early-<lb/>stage diseases. Ensuring timely and adequate follow-up is <lb/>critical for the success of disease prevention and control <lb/>efforts. To bolster referral adherence, the study identi-<lb/>fied critical factors, including age, family annual income, <lb/>public health services and referral urgency based on the <lb/>student&apos;s individual condition. <lb/>Adherence rate decreases with age <lb/>The adherence rate shows a marked decrease from <lb/>preschoolers at 19.4%-18.5% in primary school students, <lb/>and further to 7.9% in middle school students. Eye <lb/>diseases such as myopia were considered untreatable and <lb/>irreversible, 28 and it is commonly believed that interven-<lb/>tion is effective only prior to the onset of a disease, which <lb/>leads to a gradual neglect of eye health as individuals age. <lb/>However, visual development is a dynamic process, and <lb/>the stage of young adulthood remains a crucial period <lb/>for visual development. 29 <lb/>Poverty is not a deterrent to referral adherence <lb/>Hemptinne et al suggest that the expense is a crucial <lb/>determinant for parental compliance. 30 This study found <lb/>an inverse relationship between family annual income <lb/>and adherence rates. Although vision screening is state-<lb/>funded in China, further ophthalmological evalua-<lb/>tions carry additional costs. The study revealed that the <lb/>expense of a single referral ranged from ¥100 to ¥300, an <lb/>amount not prohibitive in the study&apos;s regional context. <lb/>Consequently, economic hardship does not account for <lb/>low adherence rates; in fact, families facing financial <lb/>constraints may prioritise their children&apos;s vision health. <lb/>Public health services are crucial <lb/>Students attending vision demonstration schools or <lb/>those encouraged to seek referrals by school or commu-<lb/>nity hospitals exhibited notably higher adherence rates. <lb/>Moreover, encouragement from teachers or community <lb/>physicians significantly influenced student follow-up <lb/>post-screening. This highlights the importance of public <lb/>health to enhance adherence following school vision <lb/>screenings. <lb/>Adherence does not linearly correlate with referral urgency <lb/>The adherence rate for immediate referrals was 13.8%, <lb/>surprisingly lower than for emergency (17.1%), urgent <lb/>(21.0%) and routine referrals (16.7%). Community <lb/>doctors interviewed indicated that in practice, stratified <lb/>management of students according to referral urgency <lb/>is lacking. Students with rapidly deteriorating vision <lb/>needing immediate referrals often are less aware than <lb/>those with better vision, underscoring the importance of <lb/>tiered management in student eye health. <lb/>The study findings indicate that adherence to referral is <lb/>independent of gender, ethnicity and indigenous status. <lb/>Likewise, familial financial standing and visual health <lb/>status does not predict compliance. Consistent with other <lb/>existing research, 31 enhanced governmental, community <lb/>or school vision health services are pivotal in improving <lb/>adherence. These results underscore the critical role of <lb/>public health in advancing vision health among children <lb/>and adolescents. The public health services, including <lb/>offering dedicated appointments, 32 strengthening <lb/>health education, conducting follow-up phone calls and <lb/>involving school nurses in screening programmes, have <lb/>been shown to boost post-screening referral adherence. 7 <lb/>This study has several limitations. In Shanghai&apos;s school <lb/>eye health programmes, community doctors refer chil-<lb/>dren to designated hospitals. Only follow-up results from <lb/>these hospitals are recorded in the database. Medical <lb/>records from non-designated hospitals are not included. <lb/>Survey results show that over 80% of revisits occur at <lb/>designated hospitals, suggesting a 20% follow-up loss. <lb/>Designated hospitals are public with lower costs, while <lb/>non-designated hospitals are mostly private with higher <lb/>expenses. This underlines the study&apos;s conclusion that <lb/>poverty does not hinder referral adherence. Therefore, <lb/>despite some loss to follow-up, it does not affect the <lb/>final conclusion of this study. Additionally, reliance on <lb/>parental questionnaires may not accurately reflect chil-<lb/>dren&apos;s viewpoints, and a direct appraisal of the students&apos; <lb/>self-assessed needs for referral and health perceptions <lb/>was not possible. Instead, doctor&apos;s recommendations <lb/>were used to estimate the students&apos; actual referral needs. <lb/></body>
