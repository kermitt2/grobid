			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>It is well admitted nowadays that the rapid growth of the <lb/>world population under the pressure of modern economic <lb/>development is continually and considerably increasing the <lb/>production of organic wastes. As a consequence, without <lb/>appropriate management policies, organic wastes can be <lb/>responsible of methane emissions, land degradation, water <lb/>contamination, pollution, diseases, ecosystem destruction, <lb/>etc. (Pawlita-Posmyk &amp; Wzorek, 2018; Valenti et al., 2023). <lb/>This situation heavily accentuates the climate change issues <lb/>through the emission of greenhouse gases into the <lb/>atmosphere. The worldwide stress of water can also be <lb/>mentioned as a crucial issue and thus wastewater treatment is <lb/>consequently an important topic related to waste management <lb/>policies. Therefore, some recent promising research are under <lb/>progress concerning wastewater treatments by using relevant <lb/>techniques such as microbial metabolites in the activated <lb/>sludge that govern membrane bioreactors (Sepehri &amp; <lb/>Sarrafzadeh, 2018, 2019; Sepehri et al., 2020). <lb/>For these reasons, anaerobic digestion technology is <lb/>mentioned by the United Nations in the management policy of <lb/>organic wastes. It is among important technologies that can <lb/>participate to reduce the impact of the climate change issues <lb/>and thus contributes to achieving some sustainable <lb/>development goals (Piadeh et al., 2023). <lb/>In this context, an accurate estimation, prediction and <lb/>optimization of methane generation from anaerobic <lb/>bioreactors is of paramount importance. In fact, since the <lb/>seventies, the production of methane as a renewable energy <lb/>resource generated by anaerobic bioreactors using organic <lb/>wastes started attracting attention. In the same way, many <lb/>research efforts have followed proposing models to estimate <lb/>the methane production generated from anaerobic digesters. <lb/>According to the literature review, different models have been <lb/>proposed to tackle this problem based on various approaches <lb/>(Emebu et al., 2022). <lb/>One very important approach is theory-based leading to <lb/>mathematical expressions describing the processes acting <lb/>inside the bioreactors. Some of such representative models are <lb/>ADM1 and one of its derivative named AM2 (Ozgun, 2019; Yu <lb/>et al., 2013). In particular, AM2 model reveals to be more <lb/>practical than ADM1 and is largely used to study anaerobic <lb/>digesters with different substrates in various conditions <lb/>(Zaatri &amp; Kelaiaia, 2020). But theory-based models can be <lb/></body>

			<body>mathematically complex as they are usually composed of a set <lb/>of nonlinear and coupled systems of differential equations. <lb/>Thus, they cannot provide single explicit analytic expressions <lb/>for estimating the evolution of the methane production, which <lb/>is the final product. Instead, they are much more useful for <lb/>simulating the evolution of the methane production processes. <lb/>Another issue is that it is not always easy to identify and <lb/>accurately estimate from experiments the many coefficients <lb/>and parameters involved in these complex models (Attar &amp; <lb/>Haugen, 2019; Bernard et al., 2001; Zaatri &amp; Kelaiaia, 2020). <lb/>To overcome this mathematical complexity and in parallel <lb/>with the theory-based approach, some simplistic empirical-<lb/>driven models have been proposed. These models intend to <lb/>estimate the methane production by means of single explicit <lb/>analytic mathematical functions that are assumed to fit their <lb/>dynamic experimental profiles. For this purpose, many <lb/>functions have been proposed namely Richard function, <lb/>logistic function, Gompertz function, transfer function, etc. <lb/>(Pererva et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). Generally, these <lb/>empirical-driven models involve less parameters compared to <lb/>the theory-based ones. Their parameters are identified and <lb/>estimated from graphical profiles of the evolution of the <lb/>methane production (Opurum, 2021; Pererva et al., 2020). <lb/>Similarly, by adopting some assumptions and <lb/>mathematical simplifications, some simplistic theory-based <lb/>models have leaded to single analytic functions that met <lb/>empirical-driven models. In fact, to be simplest, this type of <lb/>models use different methods: such as statistical, enzymatic, <lb/>kinetic, chemical, etc. (Dittmer et al., 2021; López-Aguilar et <lb/>al., 2021). It was obtained by considering the steady state cases <lb/>(Bernard et al., 2001), by considering the cell biomass as <lb/>constant (Moharir et al., 2020), by using simple growth laws for <lb/>bacteria, etc. (Bernard et al., 2001; Simeonov, 1999) or by <lb/>adopting appropriate simplifications (Gouveia et al., 2022). <lb/>But, because of their simplicity, this type of models cannot <lb/>reflect the sensitivity of the hidden parameters influencing <lb/>and governing the complex processes of real biotechnological <lb/>systems. <lb/>On the other side, because of the nonlinearity of the <lb/>anaerobic digestion processes and the sensitivity to their <lb/>parameters and operating conditions, the simple traditional <lb/>empirical-driven models may not ensure efficient performance <lb/>for a generalized prediction of biogas production (Amran et al., <lb/>2024; Rutland, 2023). Therefore, some models inspired from <lb/>Artificial Intelligence and modern computation techniques <lb/>have recently emerged as alternatives providing better <lb/>performances for biogas estimation, prediction, and even for <lb/>real-time control and monitoring of bioreactors (Ling et al., <lb/>2024; Swami et al., 2023). Some of these models are machine-<lb/>learning-based requiring a large amount of data. They include <lb/>artificial neural networks and statistical learning models such <lb/>as random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support <lb/>vector machine (Cruz et al., 2022). But, although ML models <lb/>may provide better performance than classic empiric-models, <lb/>they may suffer from certain limitations and challenges. These <lb/>models are represented by black-boxes and their accuracy <lb/>depends on the size of the data sets used to process the <lb/>training and the validation phases. They also depend on the <lb/>selected structure of the used ML model and from the <lb/>bioreactor under consideration. These facts make them not <lb/>largely generalizable to other bioreactors operating possibly <lb/>under different conditions. In addition, most applications are <lb/>still lab-based and performed in batch flow rather than <lb/>continuous flow bioreactors (Onu et al., 2023; Rutland, 2023). <lb/>Finally, ML models are interesting but are still under progress <lb/>and the comparison of their performances is not yet <lb/>sufficiently mature (Amran et al., 2024; Ling et al., 2024). <lb/>Finally, in the context of this research, they do not provide <lb/>single analytic expressions for the evolution of the methane <lb/>production and simple methods for identifying the parameters <lb/>characterizing the processes of methane production. <lb/>As a conclusion, according to our critical analysis of the <lb/>previous literature review, we did not find models of single <lb/>analytical expressions that describe the evolution of the <lb/>methane production while holding the many parameters and <lb/>coefficients used in the complex models representing at least <lb/>two processes such as those involved in AM2 model such as <lb/>acidogenic and methanogenic processes. On the other side, the <lb/>used parameters are usually limited, model dependant, and, <lb/>are not always easy to estimate. Thus, they do not provide <lb/>insight concerning the influence of the used parameters over <lb/>the evolution of the methane production. <lb/>In effect, as a summary, firstly, the complex theory-based <lb/>models such as AM1 and AM2 are mainly useful for simulation. <lb/>Secondly, the empirical-driven models provide single <lb/>analytical expressions but do not hold enough parameters. In <lb/>addition, there parameters may not have direct meanings <lb/>related to microbiological activities. Thirdly, some simplified <lb/>theory-based models that have derived single analytical <lb/>expressions miss most microbiological parameters and yield <lb/>coefficients. Fourthly, the ML-based models do not provide <lb/>single expressions as they are black-boxes. <lb/>Therefore, there is a need for new models derived from the <lb/>theory-based approach that can hold some microbiological <lb/>parameters and yield coefficients, but, at the same time, they <lb/>may still be comparable to empiric-driven models <lb/>representable with single analytic functions. Thus, according <lb/>to the author&apos;s review of the literature, this vision seems to <lb/>have not sufficiently investigated and that is why probably, <lb/>there is almost no references corresponding precisely to this <lb/>topic. However, in response to this issue, we have previously <lb/>proposed two contributions. By adopting some appropriate <lb/>mathematical simplifications, two single analytical <lb/>expressions derived from AM2 model while holding most of its <lb/>parameters have been proposed (Zaatri, 2021a, 2021b). In <lb/>particular, one of these research works (Zaatri, 2021b) has <lb/>proposed single analytical expressions for the evolution of the <lb/>bacteria&apos;s and the methane production in batch AD. The <lb/>expressions are derived from AM2 model with its main <lb/>parameters and are also match the profile of logistic functions. <lb/>Actually, the main objective of the present research work <lb/>aims to exploit the proposed model cited in Zaatri (2021b). Our <lb/>original contribution is the establishing of relations between <lb/>the experimental parameters of the logistic functions <lb/>concerning the evolution of the bacteria&apos; and the methane <lb/>production with those of the theoretical ones related to AM2 <lb/>model. Then, from these relations, some parameters of AM2 <lb/>can be estimated in function of the experimental ones and <lb/>vice-versa. This also leads to more qualitative and quantitative <lb/>insight concerning the evolution of the processes leading to <lb/></body>

			<body>the cumulated methane production as well as to the influence <lb/>of AM2 parameters over these processes. <lb/>MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF AM2 <lb/>MODEL <lb/>In this section, we briefly present the formulation of AM2 <lb/>model, which belongs to the theory-based approach for <lb/>estimating the cumulated methane generated by anaerobic <lb/>digestion in the case of batch bioreactors. This estimation will <lb/>be obtained via numerical simulations according to the <lb/>adopted mathematical formulation. The obtained results <lb/>provided by this formulation will serve as a reference, at least <lb/>qualitatively, to compare with those of the derived data-driven <lb/>model, which corresponds to a logistic function. <lb/>AM2 model considers the anaerobic digestion as <lb/>constituted only of two main steps leading to the production <lb/>of a biogas that contains the methane (Bernard et al., 2001). <lb/>The first step involves the acidogenic bacteria to decompose <lb/>the organic substrate into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and CO2. <lb/>Then, the second step involves the methanogenic bacteria to <lb/>generate CO2 and methane. S1 represents the concentration of <lb/>a soluble carbonaceous substrate while S2 represents the <lb/>concentration of VFA. X1 and X2 represent, respectively, the <lb/>concentrations of acidogenic and methanogenic bacteria <lb/>populations. We note that as we are principally interested in <lb/>the estimation of the cumulated methane, and since the <lb/>general set of equations of AM2 model can be decoupled, <lb/>therefore the alkalinity, the pH, the flow of CO2, or the partial <lb/>pressure of the gases will not be considered (Vargas et al., <lb/>2019). On the other hand, in this study, we are concerned with <lb/>the analysis of batch reactors, then the mathematical model is <lb/>reduced to a set of four differential equations: <lb/>𝑑𝑋 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝜇 1 𝑋 1 , <lb/>(1) <lb/>𝑑𝑋 2 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝜇 2 𝑋 2 , <lb/>(2) <lb/>𝑑𝑆 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= -𝑘 1 𝜇 1 𝑋 1 , <lb/>(3) <lb/>𝑑𝑆 2 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝑘 2 𝜇 1 𝑋 1 -𝑘 3 𝜇 2 𝑋 2 , <lb/>(4) <lb/>where k1, k2, k3, and k4 are yield coefficients associated with the <lb/>reactions. The specific reaction rates are of monod type µ1 for <lb/>acidogenesis and haldane type µ2 for methanogenesis bacteria: <lb/>𝜇 1 = 𝜇 1𝑚𝑎𝑥 <lb/>𝑆 1 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 +𝑆 1 <lb/>, <lb/>(5) <lb/>𝜇 2 = 𝜇 2𝑚𝑎𝑥 <lb/>𝑆 2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 +𝑆 2 + <lb/>𝑆 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑖2 <lb/>, <lb/>(6) <lb/>where 𝜇 1𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximal growth rate and KS1 is the constant <lb/>of half-saturation of the acidogenic biomass. 𝜇 2𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the <lb/>maximal growth rate, KS2 is the constant of saturation and Ki2, <lb/>the constant of inhibition of the methanogenesis bacteria. <lb/>Four initial conditions X1(0), S1(0), X2(0), and S2(0) have to be, <lb/>respectively, associated to the set of differential equations. <lb/>According to this model, the methane flow can be deduced <lb/>from: <lb/>𝑄 𝐶𝐻4 (𝑡) = 𝑘 4 𝜇 2 𝑋 2 (𝑡), <lb/>(7) <lb/>where k4 is the yield coefficient for the methane production. <lb/>The cumulative methane V(t) generated over a period of time t <lb/>is deduced, as follows: <lb/>𝑉(𝑡) = 𝑘 4 𝑋 2 (𝑡). <lb/>(8) <lb/>This model can simulate more or less adequately the <lb/>functioning of the anaerobic digesters and predict the <lb/>produced methane more or less accurately depending on many <lb/>factors such as the cpmposition of the substrates, the <lb/>operating conditions and the estimation of the involved <lb/>parameters. For the model under interest, there are nine <lb/>parameters to be identified, five of them are the related to the <lb/>growth processes (μ1max, KS1, μ2max, KS2, and Ki2) and four of them <lb/>are the yield parameters (k1, k2, k3, and k4). There are four initial <lb/>conditions that (X1(0), S1(0), X2(0), and S2(0)) could be <lb/>measured or estimated depending on the bioreactor design. <lb/>The methods of parameters identification consider the <lb/>bioreactor in the context of system control and use large sets <lb/>of experimental data. Then, the parameters are estimated <lb/>according to criteria&apos;s that should minimize functions of errors <lb/>between the theoretical and the experimental values (Attar &amp; <lb/>Haugen, 2019; Bernard et al., 2001). <lb/>LOGISTIC FUNCTION AS A MODEL FOR <lb/>METHANE PRODUCTION <lb/>In this section, we present the logistic function, which is <lb/>used for estimating the cumulated methane generated by <lb/>anaerobic digestion and which belongs to the data-based <lb/>approach. The logistic function is a mathematical expression, <lb/>which is used to modeling many domains of applications such <lb/>as biomathematics, chemistry, physics, demography, <lb/>economics, etc. In particular, it is used to study a population <lb/>growth under conditions of limited resources (Di Crescenzo &amp; <lb/>Paraggio, 2019). <lb/>The logistic equation emerges as a solution of a first order <lb/>differential Eq. (9), where the function X(t) represent the <lb/>growth population, given a growth rate, c, and a carrying <lb/>capacity, a. <lb/>𝑑𝑋 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝑐𝑋 (1 -<lb/>𝑋 <lb/>𝑎 <lb/>). <lb/>(9) <lb/>It has also associated to an initial value that is the initial <lb/>population: X(0)=X0. <lb/>The logistic function is usually expressed in the following <lb/>two forms, where the function is represented by X(t) while t is <lb/>the independent variable and (a, b, and c) or (a, β, and c) are its <lb/>parameters. <lb/>The first expression of the logistic function is, as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>𝑋(𝑡) = <lb/>𝑎 <lb/>1+𝑏×exp(-𝑐𝑡) <lb/>. <lb/>(10) <lb/>The second form is also known as Ratkowsky expression is, <lb/>as follows: <lb/>𝑋(𝑡) = <lb/>𝑎 <lb/>1+exp(𝛽-𝑐𝑡) <lb/>, <lb/>(11) <lb/>with b=e β and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0. <lb/>The shape of this function increases for t≥0 and has a <lb/>horizontal asymptote when t tends to an infinite value that is <lb/>the capacity=a (Figure 1). It has also an inflexion point with <lb/>coordinates (tp, xp). It corresponds to the time tp, where Xp <lb/>reaches the half value of the carrying capacity. <lb/>Once a graphical experimental profile of the logistic <lb/>function X(t) is given, its parameters (a, b, and c) can be <lb/>determined based on some particular points from the <lb/>experimental curve. The first coefficient to be determined is <lb/>the carrying capacity a that corresponds to the asymptotic <lb/>value for time to infinite time. In Figure1, it is about unity. <lb/>The second parameter b is related to the initial value of the <lb/>logistic function X0 and is determined by from the following <lb/>expression: <lb/>𝑏 = <lb/>𝑎-𝑋 0 <lb/>𝑋 0 <lb/>. <lb/>(12) <lb/>The growth rate parameter c is deduced from the <lb/>coordinates of the inflexion point. It corresponds to the time <lb/>tp, where Xp reaches the half value of the carrying capacity. <lb/>Thus, when Xp=a/2, the time is tp=(1/c)log(b), and then: <lb/>𝑐 = <lb/>1 <lb/>𝑡 𝑝 <lb/>log(𝑏). <lb/>(13) <lb/>To give meanings to the parameters of the logistic function <lb/>modeling cumulated methane production by microbiological <lb/>activities, a specific re-parameterization is defined in the <lb/>following third form (Opurum, 2021): <lb/>𝑋 𝑡 = <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>(1+exp(-<lb/>4𝑣 𝑚𝑎𝑥 <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>)(𝑡-𝜆)+2) <lb/>, <lb/>(14) <lb/>where for instance X(t) represents the cumulated methane <lb/>produced over a time duration t, A the maximum product, vmax <lb/>is the maximum production rate, and λ the lag phase time. <lb/>EVOLUTION OF ACIDOGENS BACTERIA AS <lb/>LOGISTIC FUNCTION <lb/>Approximation of Evolution of Bacteria X1(t) by a <lb/>Logistic Function <lb/>The dynamic evolution of bacteria X1(t) can be derived from <lb/>combining Eq. (1) and Eq. (5), which leads to the following <lb/>differential equations (Zaatri, 2021b): <lb/>𝑑𝑋 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝜇 1𝑚 <lb/>𝑆 1 <lb/>𝑆 1 +𝐾 𝑆1 <lb/>𝑋 1 = 𝜇 1𝑚 <lb/>(-𝑘 1 𝑋 1 +𝛼)𝑋 1 <lb/>(-𝑘 1 𝑋 1 +𝐾 𝑆1 +𝛼)𝑋 1 <lb/>, <lb/>(15) <lb/>with α=S10+k1X10. This equation can be solved and expressed as <lb/>an algebraic equation but without explicit solution in function <lb/>of time. <lb/>However, it can be expressed in the inverse form: t=g(X1) <lb/>(Zaatri, <lb/>2021a). <lb/>Nevertheless, <lb/>by <lb/>considering <lb/>an <lb/>approximation that is (k1X1&lt;α+KS1), Eq. (15) simplifies such as: <lb/>𝑑𝑋 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝜇 1𝑚 <lb/>(-𝑘 1 𝑋 1 +𝛼)𝑋 1 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 +𝛼 <lb/>= <lb/>𝛼𝜇 1𝑚 <lb/>𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 <lb/>(1 -<lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑋 1 )𝑋 1 . <lb/>(16) <lb/>One can notice that Eq. (16) corresponds formally to Eq. <lb/>(9), therefore, X1(t) can be expressed as a logistic function, as <lb/>follows: <lb/>𝑋 1 (𝑡) = <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>1 <lb/>(1+ <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 𝑋 10 <lb/>exp(-<lb/>𝛼𝜇 𝑚1 <lb/>𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 <lb/>𝑡)) <lb/>. <lb/>(17) <lb/>A similar expression has been obtained in Zaatri (2021a) <lb/>with a little difference in the adopted approximation. Eq. (17) <lb/>has the form of a logistic function as in Eq. (10). Comparing the <lb/>obtained theoretical approximated Eq. (17) with assumed <lb/>experimental logistic functions as defined in Eq. (10) and Eq. <lb/>(11) with the parameters (a1, b1, and c1), it gives the following <lb/>relations: <lb/>𝛼 1 = <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>= 𝑋 10 + <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>, <lb/>𝑏 1 = <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 𝑋 10 <lb/>, <lb/>𝑐 1 = 𝛼 <lb/>𝑢 𝑚1 <lb/>(𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 ) <lb/>. <lb/>(18) <lb/>If we consider the parameterization as defined by Eq. (11), <lb/>it gives the following relations: <lb/>𝛼 1 = <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>= 𝑋 10 + <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>, <lb/>𝑏 1 = 𝑒 𝛽 1 , <lb/>𝑐 1 = 𝛼 <lb/>𝑢 𝑚1 <lb/>(𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 ) <lb/>. <lb/>(19) <lb/>If again we consider the parameterization as defined by Eq. <lb/>(14), it gives the following relations: <lb/>𝐴 1 = 𝑎 1 = <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>= 𝑋 10 + <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>, <lb/>𝜆 1 = <lb/>𝛽-2 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>= <lb/>log(𝑏 1 )-2 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>= <lb/>(log(𝑏 1 )-2)(𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 ) <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>1 <lb/>𝑈 𝑚1 <lb/>, <lb/>(20) <lb/>𝑣 1𝑚𝑎𝑥 = <lb/>𝑎 1 𝑐 1 <lb/>4 <lb/>= <lb/>𝛼 2 <lb/>4𝑘 1 (𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 ) <lb/>𝑈 𝑚1 . <lb/>Inversely, <lb/>Figure 1.

The curve with blue stars represents X1(t) obtained from <lb/>the analytical Eq. (17), which is a logistic function. <lb/>The three remarkable points enabling to extract <lb/>graphically the parameters (a1, b1, and c1) from the supposed <lb/>experimental curve are shown with red circles. The first point <lb/>corresponds to the initial concentration at t=0, which is X10=0.4 <lb/>mg/l. The second is the inflection point (tp=9.37 days, X1=0.58 <lb/>mg/l). The third one corresponds to the steady state condition <lb/>that is X1inf, which tends to maximal value a1=1.17 mg/l reached <lb/>after about 70 days. By calculations from the given values of <lb/>AM2 model (Um1=0.4 day -1 ; KS1=72 mg/l; k1=13; X10=0.4 mg/l; <lb/>and S10=10 mg/l); the numerical values of the parameters for <lb/>the three type of logistic functions are (a1=1.17 mg/l; b1=1.92; <lb/>c1= 0.07 day -1 ). The parameter for the second form are (a1=1.17 <lb/>mg/l; β1=0.65; and c1=0.07 day -1 ). The parameters for the third <lb/>one are (a1=1.17 mg/l; 𝝀1=-19.30; and Vmax=0.02 day -1 ). <lb/>Comments <lb/>The logistic function obtained in Eq. (17) by <lb/>approximations can help to analyze the dynamic behavior of <lb/>the acetogenic population X1(t) with respect to the <lb/>corresponding AM2 parameters (U1m, KS1, and k1) and the initial <lb/>values (S10 and X10). The comparison of the empiric logistic <lb/>function in Eq. (10), Eq. (11), and Eq. (14) with our <lb/>approximated analytical logistic function in Eq. (17) leads to <lb/>the following remarks. <lb/>All parameters (a1, b1, and c1) depend on the initial <lb/>conditions (S10 and X10). The asymptotic value a1 depends <lb/>linearly on the initial conditions (S10 and X10) and on the yield <lb/>coefficient k1. Thus, the maximal production of acidogenic <lb/>bacteria X1(t) that corresponds to a1 can be increased by <lb/>increasing the initial values of X10, S10, and decreasing k1. The <lb/>intersection of X1(t) with the vertical axis, which is X0 is related <lb/>to b1 and is influenced by the parameters (X10, S10, and k1). Only <lb/>the parameter c1 depends, beside the parameters (X10, S10, and <lb/>k1), on the growth parameters (Um1 and KS1). Therefore, for <lb/>batch bioreactors, by selecting the substrate and bacteria, it <lb/>becomes possible to control the evolution of X1(t). <lb/>However, if we consider the third form of logistic function <lb/>in Eq. (14); then, only A1=a1 depends on the initial values as for <lb/>the other types. But both the lag phase time 𝝀 and the <lb/>maximum production rate Vmax are influenced by the growth <lb/>parameters (Um1 and KS1). These last relations reveals that 𝝀 <lb/>depends in an inverse linear way on the maximal growth rate <lb/>(Um1) while Vmax depends on it linearly. <lb/>Identification of AM2 Parameters from Logistic X1(t) <lb/>Profile <lb/>If one considers the parameters (a1, b1, and c1) of a logistic <lb/>function as estimated from experimental data; then, by <lb/>inversing and manipulating Eq. (18), one can infer an <lb/>estimation of some parameters of AM2 model. For instance, by <lb/>assuming that the yield coefficient k1 is determined by any <lb/>means, then, the initial conditions concerning the bacteria&apos;s <lb/>and the substrate (X10 and S10), as well as the parameter of <lb/>growth rate (Um1) can be identified with respect to the <lb/>empirical parameters (a1, b1, and c1): <lb/>X 10 = <lb/>𝑎 1 <lb/>1+𝑏 1 <lb/>, <lb/>S 10 = 𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑎 1 𝑏 1 <lb/>1+𝑏 1 <lb/>, U 𝑚1 = <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 +𝑘 1 𝑎 1 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>𝑎 1 <lb/>, <lb/>(22) <lb/>These relations reveals that X10 can be estimated from (a1 <lb/>and b1) but S10 and V1 require the determination of k1. <lb/>Moreover, S10 is proportional to k1 while Um1 is inversely <lb/>proportional to k1. In addition, these parameters (X10, S10, and <lb/>Um1) can also be expressed with respect to the biological <lb/>parameters (A1, 𝜆1, and V1max) using relations in Eq. (20) and <lb/>Eq. (21). <lb/>Approximation of Dynamic Degradation of Substrate <lb/>S1(t) <lb/>The dynamic degradation of the substrate S1(t) can be <lb/>derived from combining Eq. (1) and Eq. (3), which leads to the <lb/>following differential equations (Zaatri, 2021b): <lb/>𝑑𝑆 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= -𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑋 1 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>. <lb/>(23) <lb/>By integrating Eq. (23) and replacing X1(t) from Eq. (17), the <lb/>substrate degradation S1(t) can also be derived in the form of a <lb/>logistic function: <lb/>𝑆 1 (𝑡) = -𝑘 1 𝑋 1 (𝑡) + 𝛼 = <lb/>-𝛼 <lb/>(1+ <lb/>𝑆 10 <lb/>𝑘 1 𝑋 10 <lb/>exp(-<lb/>𝛼𝜇 𝑚1 <lb/>𝛼+𝐾 𝑆1 <lb/>𝑡)) <lb/>. <lb/>(24) <lb/>Figure 3 presents the simulation, by means of the software <lb/>Scilab, of S1(t) according to AM2 model, which is the black <lb/>curve. The curve with blue stars represents S1(t) obtained from <lb/>the analytical expression in Eq. (17), which is related to a <lb/>logistic function via X1(t). <lb/>The three remarkable points enabling to extract <lb/>graphically the parameters (a1S, b1S, and c1S) from the supposed <lb/>experimental curve are shown with red circles. The first point <lb/>corresponds to the initial concentration at t=0, which is S10=10. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>The second is the inflection point (tp=9.37 and S1=7.6). The <lb/>third one corresponds to the steady state condition that is S1inf, <lb/>which tends to the minimal value, which is about zero reached <lb/>after about 70 days and which means that the substrate are <lb/>almost completely consumed by the acidogenic bacteria <lb/>populations. <lb/>We notice that since S1(t) is directly linked to the logistic <lb/>function X1(t), then relations in Eq. (16) and Eq. (21) can be <lb/>used to estimate some parameters or group of parameters of <lb/>AM2 model. <lb/>If it is possible to obtain such curve from experimental <lb/>measures, therefor S10, which is the initial substrate can be <lb/>easily measured or estimated from the beginning. <lb/>EVOLUTION OF METHANOGENS <lb/>BACTERIA AS LOGICAL FUNCTION <lb/>From Eq. (2) and Eq. (4) of the differential equations of AM2 <lb/>model, we can write: <lb/>𝑑𝑋 2 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝜇 2 𝑋 2 = 𝜇 2𝑚𝑎𝑥 <lb/>𝑆 2 <lb/>𝑆 2 + <lb/>𝑆 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑖2 <lb/>+ 𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑋 2 . <lb/>(25) <lb/>On the other hand, as shown in paper (Zaatri, 2021b), by <lb/>manipulating and inserting Eq. (1), Eq. (2), and Eq. (4) in Eq. <lb/>(25), we can obtain a nonlinear differential equation of the first <lb/>order on X2(t), which depends on X1(t) via the term f(t) such as: <lb/>𝑑𝑋 2 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>= 𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>(-𝑘 3 𝑋 2 +𝑓)𝑋 2 <lb/>((-𝑘 3 𝑋 2 +𝑓)+ <lb/>(-𝑘 3 𝑋 2 +𝑓) 2 <lb/>𝐾 12 <lb/>+𝐾 𝑆2 ) <lb/>= 𝑔(𝑋 2 , 𝑋 1 ), <lb/>(26) <lb/>with f(t)=k2x1(t)+C and C=S20-k2X10+k3X20. <lb/>One way to provide an analytical solution to Eq. (26) <lb/>consists, as shown in Zaatri (2021b) to make some <lb/>approximations. The first step requires the adoption of a <lb/>simplified grown law for the methanogenic process such as <lb/>Blackman&apos;s model (Blackman, 1911), which is, as follows: <lb/>𝜇 2 = <lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑆 2 . <lb/>(27) <lb/>This approximation means that the growth law is relatively <lb/>valid at the beginning of the growth process. By adopting this <lb/>approximation; Eq. (25) and Eq. (26) can be written, as follows: <lb/>𝑑𝑋 2 (𝑡) <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>≅ 𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝑆 2 (𝑡) <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑋 2 = <lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑓(𝑡)𝑋 2 (𝑡). <lb/>(28) <lb/>Eq. (28) can be rewritten to match the standard form of <lb/>Bernoulli&apos;s differential equation for the particular case, where <lb/>the coefficient n=2 (Parker, 2020), that is: <lb/>𝑑𝑦(𝑡) <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>+ 𝑃(𝑡)𝑦(𝑡) = 𝑄(𝑡)𝑦 2 (𝑡). <lb/>(29) <lb/>By identification Eq. (28) to Eq. (29), one gets P(t) and Q(t): <lb/>𝑃(𝑡) = -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>(𝐶 + 𝑘 2 𝑋 1 (𝑡)), 𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑞 0 = -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑘 3 . <lb/>(30) <lb/>The differential Eq. (29) has a general solution (Parker, <lb/>2020): <lb/>𝑦(𝑡) = <lb/>𝑒 ∫ 𝑃(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 <lb/>𝑡 <lb/>0 <lb/>𝑐 0 -𝑞 0 ∫ 𝑒 ∫ 𝑃(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 <lb/>𝑡 <lb/>0 <lb/>𝑡 <lb/>0 <lb/>𝑑𝑡 <lb/>. <lb/>(31) <lb/>To explicit the general solution of Eq. (31), it requires the <lb/>provision of P(t), which means to provide the profile of X1(t). <lb/>Here again, the problem of integrating Eq. (31) is not obvious <lb/>in standard analytical expressions. So, a second approximation <lb/>is made that is to use the expression of a logistic function for <lb/>X1(t) as given by Eq. (17). Then, a third and last simplification <lb/>is necessary and consists of neglecting the terms that vanished <lb/>for relatively large values of time t in the solution of Eq. (28) <lb/>(Zaatri, 2021b). Within these approximations, the evolution of <lb/>the methanogens bacteria can then be amenable in the form of <lb/>a logistic function with respect to AM2 parameters, as follows: <lb/>𝑋 2 (𝑡) ≅ <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 0 <lb/>1 <lb/>(1+𝐸 1 exp(𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 ))𝑡 , <lb/>(32) <lb/>with 𝑝 0 = -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝐶 , 𝑝 1 = -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝛼 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>= -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>(𝑆 10 + 𝑘 1 𝑋 10 ) , <lb/>𝑞 0 = -<lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑘 3 , and 𝐸 1 = <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 0 𝑥 20 (1+𝑏 1 ) <lb/>𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>-1. <lb/>By means of Eq. (32), one can identify the parameters of the <lb/>Logistic function from the experimental data of the <lb/>methanogens bacteria growth profile for any type of the three <lb/>used forms. Using Eq. (10) of the logistic function, one can <lb/>establish the relations between its experimental parameters <lb/>(a2, b2, and c2) with those of AM2 model given by Eq. (32), which <lb/>are: <lb/>𝑎 2 = <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 1 <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>( <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑆 10 + 𝑆 20 + 𝑘 3 𝑋 20 ), <lb/>Figure 3.

(32) that is (V0equ=k4X2equ=0.006 l), which is negligible. <lb/>Based on the parameter values of AM2 model, the logistic <lb/>function parameters are: Am=39.036 l; Bm=2731.715; and <lb/>Cm=0.254 day -1 . <lb/>Some Comments About Logistic Function Representing <lb/>Cumulated Methane <lb/>The parameter Am represents the highest value reached by <lb/>the cumulated methane production. According to relation <lb/>(37), it depends on the coefficients (k1, k2, k3, and k4) and on the <lb/>initial values (S10, S20, and X20). Therefore, to increase and <lb/>optimize the methane production in batch reactors, one <lb/>should select the input products and settle the initial <lb/>conditions in the following way. Increase k2 and k4 while <lb/>decreasing k1 and k3. Increase S10, S20, and X20, by selecting the <lb/>nutriment and initial conditions. The parameter Cm represents <lb/>the production rate, according to its expression in Eq. (37), it <lb/>is related to yield coefficients and initial conditions plus the <lb/>growth rate Um and KS2. The evolution of the cumulated <lb/>methane production is then leaded by the initial conditions <lb/>and the growth parameters of the methanogens bacteria. <lb/>If we consider, the modified logistic function Vm(t) in the <lb/>form of Eq. (14), then, Eq. (35) can be written: <lb/>𝑉(𝑡) ≅ 𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 0 <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>1+𝐸 1 exp(𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 )𝑡 ) = <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>(1+exp(-<lb/>4𝑉 𝑚𝑎𝑥 <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>)(𝑡-𝜆)+2) <lb/>. <lb/>( <lb/>38) <lb/>This re-parameterization involves the maximum methane <lb/>production (A), the duration of the lag phase (λ), and the <lb/>maximum rate of methane production (vmax). By comparing the <lb/>two sides of Eq. (38), the parameters of the modified logistic <lb/>function (A, Vmax, and λ) can be expressed in terms of the <lb/>approximate AM2 model parameters, as follows: <lb/>𝐴 = 𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 0 <lb/>= <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>(𝐶 + <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑎) = <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>(𝑆 20 + 𝑘 3 𝑋 20 + <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑆 10 ), <lb/>𝑉 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = -<lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>4 <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>𝑞 0 <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>(𝐶 + <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑎) 2 𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>, <lb/>(39) <lb/>𝜆 = <lb/>2-log(𝐸 1 ) <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>[2 -log( <lb/>𝑝 0 +𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑞 0 <lb/>(1+𝐴 1 ) <lb/>-<lb/>𝑝 1 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>𝑋 20 <lb/>-1)]. <lb/>Thus, the proposed approach relates the parameters of the <lb/>logistic function (A, Vmax, and λ) with those of AM2 model. <lb/>Identification of AM2 Parameters from Logistic X1(t) <lb/>Profile <lb/>From the possible estimation of parameters (a1, b1, and c1) <lb/>and (a2, b2, and c2) or (Am, Bm, and Cm) from the logistic <lb/>functions, and, assuming for instance that the coefficients ki <lb/>and Ksi are determined by any other means, therefore, by <lb/>inversing Eq. (37), one can estimate the initial conditions <lb/>concerning the bacteria&apos;s and the substrate (X20 and S20) in the <lb/>bioreactor as well as the parameter of growth rate (Um2) such <lb/>as: <lb/>𝑋 20 = <lb/>1 <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑎 2 <lb/>1+𝑏 2 <lb/>(1 + 𝑏 1 ) <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑉 2 <lb/>𝑉 1 , <lb/>𝑆 20 = -𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑎 1 𝑏 1 <lb/>1+𝑏 1 <lb/>+ <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑎 2 <lb/>1+𝑏 2 <lb/>(1 + 𝑏 1 ) <lb/>𝑘 2 <lb/>𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑉 2 <lb/>𝑉 1 , <lb/>(40) <lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 = <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>, <lb/>with 𝑉 1 = <lb/>𝑢 𝑚1 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 <lb/>= <lb/>(𝐾 𝑆1 +𝑘 1 𝑎 1 ) <lb/>𝐾 𝑆1 𝑘 1 <lb/>𝑐 1 <lb/>𝑎 1 <lb/>and 𝑉 2 = <lb/>𝑢 𝑚2 <lb/>𝐾 𝑆2 <lb/>= <lb/>𝑘 4 <lb/>𝑘 3 <lb/>𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑎 2 <lb/>. <lb/>As a conclusion, Eq. (18) and particularly Eq. (33) as well as <lb/>their inversion establish a link between experimental profile <lb/>and AM2 model. The presented graphical representations <lb/>show that the approximation of AM2 model by a logical <lb/>function is qualitatively relevant. The logistic function profile <lb/>still follow to some extend AM2 model profile and closer <lb/>concerning the three characteristic points, which determine <lb/>the experimental parameters (a1, b1, and c1) and (a2, b2, and c2) <lb/>or (Am, Bm, and Cm). If we consider Eq. (39), they reveal the <lb/>influence of AM2 parameters and their interaction on the <lb/>experimental profile by means of the experimental parameters <lb/>(A, Vmax, and λ). This relations can be added to the strategies of <lb/>identification and estimation of AM2 parameters. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>The anaerobic digestion technology is mentioned by the <lb/>United Nations in the policy of the management of organic <lb/>wastes among technologies that contribute to achieving <lb/>sustainable development goals in the future. Considering the <lb/>importance of this technology, we have performed a <lb/>comparative and critical analysis of the literature concerning <lb/>the dynamic models for estimating and predicting the <lb/>methane production generated by anaerobic bioreactors. We <lb/>have noticed the lack for single expressions enabling to <lb/>estimate the evolution of methane production in anaerobic <lb/>bioreactors but holding significant parameters related to at <lb/>least two biologic processes that are the acidogenesis and <lb/>methanogenesis activities such as in AM2 model.

			<body>a need to determine these parameters based on the evolution <lb/>empirical profile of the acidogenic and methanogen bacteria&apos;s <lb/>populations as well as the methane production. <lb/>To this end, we have exploited a previous work that has <lb/>proposed some expressions derived from AM2 model and that <lb/>meet the profile of the logistic functions for describing the <lb/>dynamic behavior of the acidogenic and methanogen <lb/>bacteria&apos;s populations as well as the cumulative methane <lb/>production in batch bioreactors. Therefore, by comparing the <lb/>parameters of the empirical logistic functions with the logistic <lb/>functions derived from AM2 model; an estimation of AM2 <lb/>parameters can be obtained from the empiric profiles of the <lb/>temporal evolution of acidogenic and methanogen bacteria&apos;s <lb/>populations as well as the cumulative methane production in <lb/>batch bioreactors and vice versa. <lb/>The established relationships lead to more insight in the <lb/>processes of methane production by enabling the simulation <lb/>of the influence of most parameters on the cumulated methane <lb/>production. <lb/>A validation of the obtained results has been performed <lb/>through simulation with graphical representation by <lb/>comparing the logistic function derived from AM2 model with <lb/>AM2 itself. <lb/>One relevant future work will concern how to exploit the <lb/>established relations for enhancing the strategies for <lb/>parameters identification and optimization of methane <lb/>production in anaerobic bioreactors. <lb/></body>
