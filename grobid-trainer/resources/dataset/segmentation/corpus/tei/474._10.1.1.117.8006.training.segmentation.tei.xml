			<front>Implementing Atomic Sequences on Uniprocessors <lb/>Using Rollforward <lb/>David Mosberger, Peter Druschel , and Larry L. Peterson y <lb/>Department of Computer Science <lb/>University of Arizona <lb/>Tucson, AZ 85721 <lb/>fdavidm,druschel,llpg@cs.arizona.edu <lb/>Summary <lb/>This article presents a software-only solution to the synchronization problem for uniprocessors. <lb/>The idea is to execute atomic sequences without any hardware protection, and in the rare case <lb/>of pre-emption, to roll the sequence forward to the end, thereby preserving atomicity. One of <lb/>the proposed implementations protects atomic sequences without any memory-accesses. This <lb/>is significant as it enables execution at CPU-speeds, rather than memory-speeds. The benefit of <lb/>this method increases with the frequency at which atomic sequences are executed. It therefore <lb/>encourages the building of systems with fine-grained synchronization. This has the additional <lb/>advantage of reducing average latency. Experiments demonstrate that this technique has the <lb/>potential to outperform even the best hardware mechanisms. The main contribution of this article <lb/>is to discuss operating-system related issues of rollforward and to demonstrate its practicality, <lb/>both in terms of flexibility and performance. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Atomic sequences-a sequence of instructions that needs to execute without interference-are fundamental <lb/>to concurrent programs, including operating systems. 1 For this reason, processors generally provide synchro-<lb/>nization primitives, such as test-and-set or compare-and-swap in their instruction-set architecture <lb/>[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Due to the trend of implementing processors that are suitable for use in shared-memory <lb/>multiprocessors, these primitives have become quite expensive. For example, the Alpha architecture [7] pro-<lb/>vides a multiprocessor-safe load-linked/store-conditionally instruction that, on some uniprocessors, requires <lb/></body>

It is by no means to only technique to implement atomic sequences [1]. <lb/></note>

			<body>over 100 cycles to move a 64 bit quantity atomically between two memory locations. While it is certainly <lb/>possible to reduce this overhead, this example does illustrate that hardware synchronization primitives are <lb/>designed and optimized for the multiprocessor case. <lb/>On a uniprocessor, where interrupts are the only source of interference, it is possible to implement <lb/>atomic sequences by disabling interrupts. Although an order of magnitude faster than load-linked/store-<lb/>conditionally, operations for disabling interrupts are usually privileged, meaning that they cannot be directly <lb/>invoked by user processes. It is also the case that support for hierarchical priority levels is more expensive <lb/>than one might hope [9]. <lb/>Because of the limitations of these two hardware-based approaches, Bershad, Redell, and Ellis have <lb/>proposed a software-only implementation of mutual exclusion on uniprocessors [10]. However, the solution <lb/>is applicable only to simple atomic sequences that involve at most one write to shared memory. While this is <lb/>sufficient to implement synchronization primitives powerful enough to construct higher-level synchroniza-<lb/>tion objects, the approach is still limited. First, when used to build lock-based synchronization mechanisms, <lb/>it cannot be used for data-structures that are shared with interrupt handlers, as this code cannot risk blocking. <lb/>(In general, lock-based solutions introduce the problem of deadlock.) Second, while it is possible to create <lb/>lock-free data-structures based on some of these primitives, it is well-known that this approach can incur <lb/>significant overheads, often requiring reference counts and/or shadow copies of shared objects [11, 12]. <lb/>To alleviate these limitations, we propose the use of rollforward. When an atomic sequence is pre-<lb/>empted, the system arranges for the sequence to be executed to the end before resuming the new task. This <lb/>approach puts few restrictions on the code that constitutes atomic sequences. In particular, the number <lb/>of writes is essentially unlimited. Consequently, it is well-suited for constructing efficient lock-free data <lb/>structures. Also, as the technique is purely software-based, it can be used to achieve mutual exclusion at <lb/>any privilege level. This makes it equally well suited for implementation within the OS kernel (e.g., for <lb/>device drivers) and in user-level processes (e.g., to protect against asynchronous events such as Unix signals <lb/>[13] or VMS Asynchronous System Traps [14]). Even though the technique is not directly applicable to <lb/>multiprocessor synchronization, it is useful in constructing lock-free data-structures on machines that do not <lb/>have sufficiently powerful hardware-primitives [15]. <lb/>While the idea of rollforward is straight-forward, there are several interesting issues. For example, <lb/>we found that it is possible to trade flexibility for performance. As different applications require different <lb/>performance/flexibility tradeoffs, no single solution will suite all of them. Also, it is not immediately clear <lb/>what kind of events ought to be interpreted as pre-emption points. On a uniprocessor, the ultimate source of <lb/>pre-emption is the interrupt. However, in many cases it is possible to work with higher-level, less frequent <lb/>events, such as Unix signal-delivery. Finally, in some applications, it may also be necessary to address <lb/>issues like interactions with the memory system, multiple address spaces, and multiple trust domains. This <lb/>indicates that rollforward has a rather rich design-space. The main contribution of this article is to explore <lb/>this space and to quantify the performance of specific design-points. <lb/>The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 is a general treatment of the rollforward technique. <lb/></body>

			<page>2 <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 3 presents three concrete rollforward mechanisms. The performance of these mechanisms is reported <lb/>in Section 4. For comparison, it also reports on the performance of other hardware and software-based <lb/>synchronization primitives. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks. <lb/>2 Design Issues <lb/>The basic idea of using rollforward to ensure the atomicity is simple: at every pre-emption point, check <lb/>whether an atomic sequence has been executing, and if so, roll it forward before resuming the new task. <lb/>Any rollforward scheme thus needs to provide two mechanisms: one to detect that an atomic sequence <lb/>has been executing, and one to recover from this situation. A third, orthogonal issue, is pre-emption <lb/>granularity-defining what kind of events constitute a pre-emption point. <lb/>2.1 Pre-Emption Granularity <lb/>With rollforward, every pre-emption point incurs some extra overhead due to atomic sequence detection <lb/>and recovery. Therefore, the lower the frequency at which pre-emption events occur, the better rollforward <lb/>will work. On a uniprocessor the ultimate, and therefore finest-grained, pre-emption event is the interrupt. <lb/>Solving the problem at this level will lead to a general solution. In many cases, however, this may be either <lb/>not feasible, for example because a general user may not have permission to modify the operation system, <lb/>or overly general, and thus, overly costly in terms of implementation and performance. <lb/>In general, it is desirable to define pre-emption at as high a level as possible. For any given application, <lb/>the appropriate level can be determined quite easily. For example, in a Unix environment where the intent <lb/>is to protect processes from asynchronously executing signal handlers, the pre-emption event is signal <lb/>delivery. In a system with multi-threaded processes, pre-emption events are user-level scheduling decisions. <lb/>In contrast, a system that allows sharing of data across address-spaces must also consider kernel-level <lb/>scheduling decisions as pre-emption points. Only when sharing data with interrupt handlers will it be <lb/>necessary to descend to the lowest level and define interrupts as the source of pre-emption. <lb/>For the sake of generality and concreteness, the rest of this article focuses on the case where interrupts <lb/>are the pre-emption points. Unless noted otherwise, the following discussions apply directly or in a straight-<lb/>forward manner to coarser grained applications. <lb/>2.2 Registering Atomic Sequences <lb/>To detect the execution of atomic sequences, it is necessary to register their existence with the interrupt <lb/>system. Many registration schemes are conceivable and we present only four possibilities in that spectrum: <lb/>designated sequences, static registration, dynamic registration, and hybrid registration. The first two were <lb/>previously suggested by Bershad et al. [10]; we repeat them here for completeness. We found that both <lb/>approaches rather seriously limit flexibility. The third and fourth approach remove these limitations at the <lb/>cost of slightly higher overheads. <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>2.2.1 Designated Sequences <lb/>The first proposal in [10] is to use designated instruction sequences to mark atomic sequences. This is also <lb/>the technique used in [16]. Designated sequences must not appear anywhere but in atomic sequences. An <lb/>interrupt handler can check whether the program-counter (PC) is inside an atomic sequence by matching the <lb/>surrounding code according to a set of templates. If a template matches, the interrupted handler concludes <lb/>that it pre-empted an atomic sequence and performs the appropriate recovery action. The advantage of <lb/>designated sequences is that they do not incur any overheads per execution of an atomic sequence, yet allow <lb/>for inlining. The difficulty in using designated sequences lies in finding code sequences that do not occur <lb/>outside of atomic sequences. Also, matching templates against the code in the vicinity of the saved PC can <lb/>be time consuming. <lb/>The difficulty in finding designated sequences is ameliorated by the fact that with rollforward, the <lb/>matching does not need to be precise. It is acceptable to mistakenly classify a code sequence as atomic <lb/>(i.e., false hits are tolerable). No harm is done by executing a short piece of code prematurely. Of course, <lb/>the probability of false hits should be small. Otherwise, the overheads due to rollforward could negate the <lb/>advantage of software-based mutual exclusion. Note that imprecise designated sequences are not acceptable <lb/>with rollback because restarting a code sequence that in reality is not naturally restartable may lead to <lb/>unpredictable results. In this sense, designated sequences can be used more readily with rollforward than <lb/>with rollback. <lb/>2.2.2 Static Registration <lb/>A second approach is static registration. At program startup time, all atomic sequences are registered with <lb/>the interrupt system by specifying their starting addresses and lengths. As with designated sequences, <lb/>there is no registration overhead once the program is initialized. However, testing whether an interrupted <lb/>process was executing inside an atomic sequence can be rather expensive if many atomic sequences are <lb/>registered. Proliferation on the number of atomic sequences can be avoided by having only a single atomic <lb/>sequence, such as a software-based test-and-set operation, which is then used to build higher level <lb/>synchronization objects. Limiting the number of atomic sequences unfortunately makes it impossible to <lb/>inline atomic sequences. This imposes an indirect cost of a function call per atomic sequence. Also, a major <lb/>reason for our interest in rollforward is the flexibility it affords. Restricting the number of atomic sequences <lb/>to one would completely circumvent this flexibility. <lb/>2.2.3 Dynamic Registration <lb/>A third approach is dynamic registration. A process notifies the interrupt system of an atomic sequence just <lb/>before entering it, executes it, and finally cancels the registration. This has the disadvantage of incurring an <lb/>overhead every time an atomic sequence is executed. On the positive side, it combines the advantages of <lb/>designated sequences and static registration. Inlining poses no problem. The extent of an atomic sequence <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>can be computed at run time, so even late forms of inlining, such as code synthesis [11], would work. <lb/>Checking whether an atomic sequence was interrupted is efficient as well. It involves no more than two <lb/>comparisons: one to determine whether an atomic sequence is registered and a second to check whether the <lb/>sequence has finished execution already. Depending on implementation details, the second check may not <lb/>be necessary. <lb/>2.2.4 Hybrid Registration <lb/>A fourth approach is what we call hybrid registration. It is a combination of designated sequences and <lb/>dynamic registration. The hybrid scheme registers an atomic sequence just like the dynamic approach. <lb/>However, after executing an atomic sequence, the registration is not cancelled explicitly. Instead, a designated <lb/>sequence is used to delineate the end of the sequence. An interrupt handler checks whether an atomic sequence <lb/>has been pre-empted by first checking whether a registration is pending. If so, it must ensure the atomic <lb/>sequence has not terminated already. This is achieved by checking whether a designated sequence appears <lb/>within the next few instructions beyond the point of interruption. If both conditions hold (registration <lb/>is pending and designated sequence is present), the interrupt handler concludes an atomic sequence was <lb/>pre-empted and initiates a rollforward. Just as with (imprecise) designated sequences, there is a potential for <lb/>false hits. As already observed, this is harmless as long as the sequence rolled forward terminates quickly. <lb/>The advantage of this scheme is twofold. First, not having to cancel registrations explicitly saves <lb/>at least one instruction per atomic sequence. Second, registrations can be understood as hints: spurious <lb/>&quot;registrations&quot; are tolerable as long as they occur infrequently. Not explicitly cancelling a registration is just <lb/>one optimization enabled by the hint nature of registrations. As shown in Section 3, exploiting this property <lb/>can lead to a highly efficient registration scheme that does not involve any loads or stores to memory. <lb/>2.3 Rolling Forward Atomic Sequences <lb/>A recovery mechanism is needed for the case where an atomic sequence has been pre-empted. With <lb/>rollforward, recovery is achieved by finishing execution of the interrupted sequence before resuming the <lb/>new task. Of course, rollforward should occur in a controlled fashion and must guarantee that control <lb/>eventually will return to the interrupt handler. <lb/>2.3.1 Code Rewriting <lb/>An obvious solution is to rewrite the interrupted code by temporarily replacing the first instruction past the <lb/>atomic sequence with a jump that leads back to the interrupt handler. A nice property of code rewriting is that <lb/>it has no overheads except in the rare case of actual interference. It requires that instructions are located in a <lb/>writable segment of the address space. After modifying the code, coherency has to be established between <lb/>data space (where the new code is written to) and instruction space (where the new code will be executed <lb/>from). Older processors that do not employ separate instruction and data caches guarantee this automatically. <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>On many modern processors, however, establishing coherence requires explicit cache flushing, which can <lb/>be costly. <lb/>2.3.2 Cloning <lb/>The designers of Scheduler Activations [17] proposed a technique that has no overheads per atomic sequence <lb/>but does not require write access to the code segment. The idea was to clone every atomic sequence. The <lb/>original copy is left unmodified while the cloned copy is modified to end with an instruction that relinquishes <lb/>control back to the interrupt handler. Given the short size of atomic sequences, code growth due to cloning <lb/>is not likely to be a problem. However, a difficulty with this scheme is the need for an efficient mechanism <lb/>to map a PC in the original atomic sequence into the corresponding PC in the cloned copy of the atomic <lb/>sequence. The interrupt handler has to perform this mapping in order to locate the right cloned code given <lb/>a PC pointing to any instruction in the interrupted sequence. This mapping problem is aggravated if atomic <lb/>sequences can be inlined. <lb/>2.3.3 Computed Jumps <lb/>Computed jumps provide an alternative solution. With this approach, every atomic sequence ends with a <lb/>jump to an address stored in a variable, say dest. Before the atomic sequence is entered, the address of the <lb/>instruction immediately following the atomic sequence is stored in dest. If the atomic sequence executes <lb/>without interruption, dest points to the instruction after the jump and the jump acts as a &quot;no operation&quot; <lb/>(NOP). Conversely, if the atomic sequence is interrupted, the interrupt handler can overwrite dest with <lb/>the address of the instruction where it wants to resume execution once the atomic sequence has finished. <lb/>This scheme should work on almost any imaginable system. While widely and easily applicable, it has the <lb/>disadvantage of adding a jump to every atomic sequence. <lb/>2.3.4 Controlled Faults <lb/>Sometimes it is more convenient for an interrupt handler to regain control via a fault (trap or software-<lb/>interrupt) instead of a jump. This is particularly useful if the interrupt handler executes at a higher privilege <lb/>level than the interrupted code. Just as with computed jumps, an instruction is placed at the end of the atomic <lb/>sequence that normally acts as a NOP. If properly chosen, the interrupt handler can then change the state of <lb/>the system such that this &quot;NOP&quot; causes a fault during rollforward. For example, in a system with memory <lb/>protection, a dummy read from a special page could be performed. Normally, processes would have read <lb/>access to that page. But during recovery, the interrupt handler would remove read access from that page. <lb/>After leaving the atomic sequence, the CPU will attempt to read from that special page and cause an access <lb/>violation fault. The access fault handler can then check whether a rollforward is in progress, and if so, pass <lb/>control back to the interrupt handler. Other kinds of faults that are easily exploited for this purpose include <lb/>unaligned memory access faults and division by zero faults. The only condition on the kinds of faults that <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>can be used for this purpose is that it must be possible to resume a process after taking such a fault. Any <lb/>precise fault guarantees this [18]. <lb/>2.4 Challenges in Realizing Rollforward <lb/>So far, we have proposed mechanisms to regain control once an atomic sequence has finished execution. <lb/>This is not sufficient, as it is also necessary to guarantee that a rollforward does indeed terminate. In fact, it is <lb/>usually desirable that it will terminate within a certain time-limit. This problem becomes quite challenging <lb/>if a rollforward can cause further faults. <lb/>2.4.1 Limiting the Duration of a Rollforward <lb/>If a precise registration scheme is used and the interrupt handler can trust in the code being rolled forward, <lb/>limiting rollforward-duration is not an issue because atomic sequences will be short by design. <lb/>An imprecise registration scheme can result in the rollforward of arbitrary code sequences. Even if all <lb/>code is trusted, it is necessary to employ a mechanism to limit rollforward duration. This is because perfectly <lb/>reasonable code may contain endless loops (e.g., the idle-loop in an operating system). Similar care has to <lb/>be taken if there is a potential for malicious code being rolled forward. <lb/>Excessively long rollforwards can be handled by punishing such &quot;malicious&quot; code. For example, if an <lb/>atomic sequence is found to execute for longer than, say, one timer interrupt period, the underlying address <lb/>space could be terminated. A less aggressive solution would be to simply give no atomicity guarantees to <lb/>such atomic sequences. That is, after the timer expires, execution is pre-empted and interrupt-handling is <lb/>resumed. This solution could work reasonably well on systems with fine-grained, low-overhead watchdog <lb/>timer support. <lb/>Yet another solution is to inspect the code prior to execution. This is feasible provided the inspected <lb/>code does not modify itself; e.g., it is trusted or in a page with no write permission. If we also disallow <lb/>backward jumps and subroutine calls, checking that a given sequence of instructions will terminate has a <lb/>time complexity that is linear in the number of instructions. Fortunately, many recent CPUs have regular <lb/>instruction encodings such that this analysis can be done efficiently. In some cases, it may also be possible <lb/>to perform this check earlier than at interrupt time-it could be as early as compilation time or as late as <lb/>program startup time. <lb/>2.4.2 Faults During Rollforward <lb/>Limiting rollforward duration is not necessarily equivalent to limiting the number of instructions in an <lb/>atomic sequence. Particularly if there are faults during rollforward, the time required for a rollforward <lb/>may easily exceed the desired limit. Worse still, if an atomic sequence repeatedly causes, for example, a <lb/>division-by-zero fault, it may not be possible to ever complete the atomic sequence. <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>It is therefore necessary to impose the rule that atomicity is guaranteed only for sequences that execute <lb/>fault-free. Except for page faults, this is not very difficult in practice. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out <lb/>that there can be rather subtle sources of faults. For example, many architectures define a few instructions that <lb/>are subsettable. Implementations may choose to emulate such instructions in software to reduce hardware <lb/>cost. Unless the emulation is uninterruptible, atomic sequences should not contain such instructions. <lb/>We emphasize that page faults are often transparent. For a group of processes, page faults are only <lb/>detectable if one process might execute while another is suspended on a (shared) page miss. For example, in <lb/>a traditional Unix process sharing data with signal handlers, page faults are fully transparent. On the other <lb/>hand, if several Unix processes cooperate via shared memory, page faults are not transparent. <lb/>A simple solution is to avoid page faults in the first place. This is possible if the code of atomic sequences <lb/>and shared memory can be pinned. By definition, pinned memory is never paged out and therefore stays <lb/>resident in physical memory. This is certainly a realistic solution for the parts of the kernel that interact <lb/>with interrupt handlers. There, page-faults must be avoided anyway, so this solution comes at no extra cost. <lb/>However, it is undesirable to allow user processes to pin down large amounts of memory. <lb/>If it is not possible to avoid page faults altogether, it may be possible to avoid them at inopportune <lb/>places. If both the code of an atomic sequence and the data that it accesses are contained in a single page <lb/>each, rollforward is applicable without any additional mechanisms: the atomic sequence obviously cannot <lb/>be started before the instruction page is present. In contrast, the data page may cause a fault at an arbitrary <lb/>point in the atomic sequence. However, as all data is contained in a single page, the atomic sequence cannot <lb/>have read or modified any state yet. It is thus acceptable to block the atomic sequence while loading the <lb/>data page. Eventually, both the instruction and data pages are present and at that point the sequence can <lb/>finish execution without further faulting. If the limitation to single pages is unacceptable, prologue code <lb/>touching all needed pages could be executed before starting the atomic sequence. Thus, by the time the <lb/>atomic sequence starts execution, it is guaranteed that all pages are present. Note that the prologue code <lb/>itself must be executed atomically as well (otherwise a page fault may lead to a needed page being paged <lb/>out again). As the prologue does not modify state, it is a naturally restartable atomic sequence that can be <lb/>implemented via rollback. In essence, the prologue code is executed repeatedly until it can execute without <lb/>incurring a page-fault, at which point the rollforward-protected atomic sequence is started. Since all pages <lb/>are now present, it is guaranteed that the atomic sequence can finish without further faulting. <lb/>Finally, note that instruction or data page faults during atomic sequences are permissible as long as no <lb/>other process accesses any of the shared data being accessed by an atomic sequence that is blocked on a page <lb/>fault. This can be achieved in a number of ways. A simple solution is to modify the registration protocol <lb/>such that entering an atomic sequence would cause a fault if another atomic sequence is blocked on a page <lb/>fault already. For example, a dummy read from a shared page could be performed when entering atomic <lb/>sequences. Upon a page fault within an atomic sequence, read-permission is turned off and future processes <lb/>will be prevented from entering atomic sequences. Once the blocked atomic sequence has terminated, read-<lb/>permission is turned back on and all processes that faulted on the read to the dummy page can be resumed. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Of course, finer-grained schemes are possible. In the extreme case, one could control access to individual <lb/>shared objects, thus maximizing concurrency. With fine-grained control, it might be more economical to <lb/>control access via unaligned access faults rather than page protection faults. The general mechanism remains <lb/>the same, however. <lb/>3 Implementation <lb/>This section describes three implementations of registration schemes. Given the large design space, the <lb/>limitation to only three implementations is somewhat arbitrary. However, they were chosen based on unique <lb/>features that make them worthwhile to highlight: the first uses dynamic registration and a computed jump <lb/>to relinquish control back to the interrupt handler. It is the most obvious implementation, and is therefore <lb/>easy to explain. It also serves as a benchmark against which the other, more involved schemes, can be <lb/>compared. The second is a slight variation of the first-instead of a jump, a fault is used to provide the <lb/>interrupt handler with the means of regaining control. This might be an appropriate choice in situations where <lb/>atomic sequences execute at a lower privilege level than the interrupt handler. The third implementation <lb/>uses the hybrid registration scheme and, like the first one, provides a jump to relinquish control. This <lb/>implementation incurs the lowest overheads per atomic sequence, and has the potential to outperform even <lb/>the best hardware-based schemes. <lb/>3.1 Dynamic Registration Scheme With Jump (Dyn/Jump) <lb/>The most straight-forward dynamic registration scheme is shown below. First, variable destAddr is set to <lb/>the address of the instruction designated by label theEnd. To indicate that the process is executing an atomic <lb/>sequence, inAS is set to true. Then, the code of the actual atomic sequence is executed. Afterwards, inAS is <lb/>reset to false and a jump to the address stored in destAddr is performed. In the normal case, this will jump <lb/>to label theEnd and therefore act as a NOP. Notice that this implementation depends on the fact that word <lb/>reads and writes execute atomically. <lb/>destAddr <lb/>addressOf (theEnd) <lb/>inAS <lb/>TRUE <lb/>hatomic sequence : : : i <lb/>inAS <lb/>FALSE <lb/>jump destAddr <lb/>theEnd: <lb/>If every atomic sequence is wrapped in this manner, the state of variable inAS is an accurate indication <lb/>of whether a process is executing in an atomic sequence. An interrupt handler therefore has to read a single <lb/>word to check whether a rollforward is necessary. If so, the interrupt handler changes destAddr to point to <lb/>an instruction in its own code, restores the state of the interrupted process, and jumps to the saved PC. This <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>causes the interrupted atomic sequence to be executed to the end. The computed jump then transfers control <lb/>back to the interrupt handler where it reestablishes its own state and continues with the actual interrupt <lb/>processing. <lb/>On a DEC Alpha, this produces the following code for an atomic sequence that increments variable <lb/>sharedCounter. As can be seen, an overhead of five instructions has to be paid per atomic sequence: two <lb/>load address instructions, two stores, and a jump instruction (overhead instructions are marked with an <lb/>asterisk). It should be noted that on the Alpha, the load address instruction (lda) is an assembler-provided <lb/>pseudo-instruction that usually expands into a load word instruction. However, in some cases it expands into <lb/>a short sequence of ALU operations or several load instructions. The exact choice depends on the assembler <lb/>in use and the address being loaded. Thus, the number of overhead instructions may be higher in some cases. <lb/>* lda r4, inAS <lb/># load address of inAS <lb/>* lda r1, theEnd <lb/># load address of theEnd into r1 <lb/>* stl zero, (r4) <lb/># inAS &lt;-TRUE (0 = TRUE) <lb/>lda r3, sharedCounter # load address of sharedCounter <lb/>ldl r2, (r3) <lb/># load value of sharedCounter <lb/>addl r2, 1, r2 <lb/># increment counter <lb/>stl r2, (r3) <lb/># store back new value <lb/>* stl r1, (r4) <lb/># reset inAS to FALSE (not 0 = FALSE) <lb/>* jmp (r1) <lb/># jump to address stored in r1 <lb/>theEnd: <lb/>3.2 Dynamic Registration Scheme With Fault (Dyn/Fault) <lb/>The pseudo-code for the second implementation is given below. Just as in C, an asterisk denotes pointer <lb/>dereferencing. The instruction that potentially causes a fault is the dereferencing of pointer variable false-<lb/>OrFault . Normally, this variable points to a memory location holding value FALSE. Thus, in the absence of <lb/>interference, the code sequence will reset inAS to false after executing the atomic sequence. However, before <lb/>performing a rollforward, an interrupt handler changes falseOrFault to an unaligned address. This fault is <lb/>intercepted by the interrupt handler and thus allows it to regain control after a rollforward. Obviously, this <lb/>implementation only works on machines that require aligned memory accesses, as is the case for most RISC <lb/>processors. After regaining control, the interrupt handler has to change the state of the faulting process such <lb/>that it will be able to resume execution. This is most easily done by resetting inAS to false and advancing <lb/>the saved PC to the address stored in destAddr (i.e., by skipping the faulting instruction). <lb/>destAddr <lb/>addressOf (theEnd) <lb/>inAS <lb/>TRUE <lb/>hatomic sequence : : : i <lb/>theEnd: <lb/>inAS <lb/>falseOrFault <lb/>This implementation weakens the semantics of inAS in a rather subtle way: the fault-causing instruction <lb/>is executed before inAS is reset to false. This is done to keep the number of overhead instructions low <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>and to avert the danger of a compiler optimizing away the fault causing instruction. Unfortunately, this <lb/>means that an interrupt handler has to be more careful before initiating a rollforward. As before, it first <lb/>checks whether inAS is true. In addition, it has to check whether the saved PC of the interrupted process <lb/>points to an instruction before label theEnd. Only if both conditions hold should a rollforward be initiated. <lb/>Otherwise, it could happen that a process is interrupted after dereferencing falseOrFault but before storing <lb/>false to inAS. If only inAS were used, the interrupt handler would initiate a rollforward. However, the fault <lb/>causing instruction has been executed already and the interrupt handler would not be able to regain control <lb/>of the CPU; the interrupt would be lost. For the second check to work properly, the atomic sequence must <lb/>not consist of any instructions beyond label theEnd. In practice, this means that function calls cannot be <lb/>permitted in atomic sequences protected with this registration scheme. <lb/>The above pseudo-code can be optimized in several ways. For example, destAddr and inAS can be <lb/>merged into a single variable if there is a distinguished address that cannot be a valid instruction address (e.g., <lb/>zero or an odd address). For brevity, we omit the assembly code produced when applying this optimization. <lb/>On the Alpha, the resulting code has six overhead instructions: four loads and two stores. <lb/>3.3 Hybrid Registration Scheme With Jump (Hyb/Jump) <lb/>The pseudo-code for the hybrid registration scheme is given below. It is identical to the one for the <lb/>Dyn/Jump implementation, except that the final assignment &quot;inAS FALSE&quot; is missing. This is possible <lb/>because registration is only a hint. The code below guarantees that whenever executing an atomic sequence, <lb/>inAS will be true and destAddr will point to the end of the atomic sequence. The opposite is not necessarily <lb/>true. An interrupt handler first checks whether inAS is true. If it is, the interrupted process might have <lb/>been executing an atomic sequence. For this to be the case, the saved PC of the process has to point to an <lb/>instruction before label theEnd and the instruction before address destAddr must be a jump (i.e., the jump <lb/>instruction serves as the designated sequence). If these conditions hold and the code between the saved <lb/>PC and theEnd is &quot;safe&quot; to execute (does not involve endless looping etc.), the interrupt handler initiates a <lb/>rollforward. <lb/>destAddr <lb/>addressOf (theEnd) <lb/>inAS <lb/>TRUE <lb/>hatomic sequence : : : i <lb/>jump destAddr <lb/>theEnd: <lb/>As registration is only a hint, interesting optimizations can be applied. Like before, destAddr and inAS <lb/>can be merged into a single variable. In addition, it is now possible to allocate this merged variable to a <lb/>register that is well-known to the interrupt handler. The above pseudo-code can therefore be implemented <lb/>without any memory load or store operations and yet the well-known register is tied up only while executing <lb/>in an atomic sequence. Using a register also has the added benefit that code following the atomic sequence <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>is likely to quickly overwrite the value in that register. This has the effect of automatically cancelling the <lb/>registration of the previous atomic sequence. For this purpose, it is best if the register is frequently used <lb/>(such as a compiler temporary) and-to reduce the probability of false hits-if instruction addresses have <lb/>values that are unlikely to occur in ordinary computations. <lb/>On the Alpha, the example to increment a shared counter translates to the code shown below. Notice that <lb/>this code has only two overhead instructions: a load address and a jump (again, overhead instructions are <lb/>marked with an asterisk). That is, no memory accesses are necessary to register an atomic sequence. 2 For <lb/>dynamic registration schemes, this is probably close to the minimum achievable instruction count overhead. <lb/>In essence, the first load corresponds to a &quot;disable interrupts&quot; instruction and the jump corresponds to an <lb/>&quot;enable interrupts&quot; instruction. <lb/>* lda r1, theEnd <lb/># load address of theEnd into r1 <lb/>lda r3, sharedCounter # load address of sharedCounter <lb/>ldl r2, (r3) <lb/># load value of sharedCounter <lb/>addl r2, 1, r2 <lb/># increment counter <lb/>stl r2, (r3) <lb/># store back new value <lb/>* jmp (r1) <lb/># jump to address stored in r1 <lb/>theEnd: <lb/>Note that implementations that use a jump also admit the implementation of interrupt priority &quot;levels&quot; in <lb/>a straight-forward and efficient manner. One could encode the priority level at which the sequence executes <lb/>in an integer that is placed between jump instruction and label theEnd. An interrupt handler can check this <lb/>word and perform a rollforward only if the interrupt priorit y is not higher than that integer. It is interesting <lb/>to observe that this works properly even in the presence of false hits leading to extraneous rollforwards. The <lb/>integer following the jump simply decreases the probability of false hits. Except for a slight increase in code <lb/>size and the associated cache effects, this is a zero cost extension. <lb/>3.4 Summary <lb/>The three implementations presented above can be summarized according to efficiency and the flexibility <lb/>they afford. For completeness, we also include Bershad et al.&apos;s rollback technique. The table is ordered <lb/>according to increasing flexibility. In general, the more flexible a solution, the higher the overheads it <lb/>imposes. The only exception to this rule is Dyn/Fault, which is more restrictive, yet has one more overhead <lb/>instruction than Dyn/Jump. <lb/>Technique: Restrictions on Atomic Sequences: <lb/>Rollback: <lb/>At most one write to shared memory. <lb/></body>

There are other, potentially more efficient, schemes to load a 64 bit constant. Also, if the Alpha architecture <lb/>would provide a PC-relative addressing mode, the first overhead instruction could be implemented by a single non-memory touching <lb/>instruction, assuming the atomic sequence is reasonably short. <lb/></note>

			<body>Hyb/Jump: No backward jumps or function calls and limit on maximum code size. <lb/>Dyn/Fault: No function calls. <lb/>Dyn/Jump: No limitations. <lb/>4 Experimental Results <lb/>This section presents the performance of the three implementations introduced in the previous section. For <lb/>comparison, we also report on the performance of various hardware based schemes and of sigprocmask, the <lb/>Unix user-level equivalent of disabling interrupts. There are three performance parameters associated with <lb/>rollforward: (1) overhead per atomic sequence, (2) overhead per interrupt, and (3) overhead per rollforward. <lb/>It is difficult to measure the overhead per interrupt in isolation. Instead, we report the overall performance <lb/>of rollforward in an experimental OS kernel. <lb/>4.1 Overhead Per Atomic Sequence <lb/>Table 1 presents the overhead, measured in CPU cycles, that occurs with every execution of an atomic <lb/>sequence. It includes the execution time of everything that has to be done in addition to the actual atomic <lb/>sequence in order to guarantee atomicity. For a hardware-based scheme, this is typically the time to disable <lb/>interrupts before entering the atomic sequence and to re-enable interrupts after leaving the atomic sequence. <lb/>For software-based schemes, this includes registration overheads, for example. The hardware on which we <lb/>obtained these results consisted of a DEC 3000 Model 600 AXP workstation with an Alpha CPU operating <lb/>at 175 MHz and an HP 9000/735 with a PA-RISC 1.1 CPU operating at 99 MHz [7, 3]. All tests were small <lb/>enough to fit in the cache and the reported results are the execution times when running in the cache (i.e., <lb/>with a &quot;warm&quot; cache). Both machines provide timers with a resolution of a single CPU cycle. Measuring <lb/>execution time via these timers adds up to 3 cycles. For consistency, we did not account for this overhead <lb/>in any of the measurements. The numbers reported are the mode of the execution time histograms obtained <lb/>after running each test 1000 times. In all measurements, except the ones for sigprocmask, more than 995 <lb/>samples had the value of the mode. <lb/>The first test program, NULL, is an empty atomic sequence. In theory, the overheads measured with <lb/>this test should be the constant that gets added to the execution time of any atomic sequence. However, <lb/>the code implementing atomicity interacts with the code implementing the atomic sequence. For example, <lb/>the former may compete with the latter for registers and/or cache memory. Thus, the effective overheads <lb/>may be bigger than what is observed for an empty atomic sequence. The opposite can occur as well: an <lb/>empty atomic sequences causes the atomicity code that runs before the atomic sequence and the one that runs <lb/>afterwards to be executed back to back. This can result in additional CPU stalls. In this case, the overheads <lb/>for an empty atomic sequence would be pessimistic. With these considerations in mind, we also timed two <lb/>non-trivial test programs. They are simple as well, but realistic. Test program LIFO measures the time to add <lb/>an element to a singly-linked stack and to remove that same element again. This code involves two atomic <lb/></body>

Test program FIFO measures the time to enqueue an element into an empty, singly-linked queue <lb/>and to dequeue that same element. It also involves two atomic sequences. In both cases, care was taken to <lb/>write the programs in a way that prevented the compiler&apos;s optimizer from taking any shortcuts. For these <lb/>two programs, the overheads should be twice as high as those for the NULL program. When comparing <lb/>the numbers reported in the NULL column with those in the LIFO and FIFO columns, it becomes apparent <lb/>that this simple relationship does not always hold; the interaction between the atomicity code and the actual <lb/>atomic sequence is not negligible. <lb/>We measured the following mutual exclusion techniques: <lb/>sigprocmask: Using sigprocmask to disable signal SIGALRM before entering the atomic sequence and to <lb/>restore the old signal mask after leaving the atomic sequence. <lb/>Dyn/Fault, Dyn/Jump, Hyb/Jump: See Section 3. For the Dyn/Jump and Hyb/Jump implementations, <lb/>the plain version and the version encoding an interrupt priority level in the word following the jump <lb/>instruction had the same execution times, so we report only one number. <lb/>DI: Disabling all interrupts before entering an atomic sequence and enabling all interrupts after leaving it; <lb/>i.e., this scheme does not admit interrupt priority levels. The Alpha architecture does not support <lb/>this. However, the implementation described in [19] provides the required facilities in a chip specific <lb/>fashion. These low-level facilities normally are not accessible to kernel-level software. The measure-<lb/>ments therefore had to be performed in a small stand-alone system. For the PA-RISC, the technique <lb/>was measured in a Mach [20] kernel that was extended with the test programs. <lb/>CIPL: Changing interrupt priority level via inlined code. The same comments as for DI apply. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>splx: This is the same as CIPL except that it adds the overhead of a function call. That is, the code to change <lb/>the interrupt priority level is no longer inlined. <lb/>PALcode: The Alpha architecture defines a Privileged Architecture Library (PALcode). This library code <lb/>is invoked via traps and executes in privileged kernel mode with interrupts turned off [7]. We did not <lb/>have the opportunity to implement the benchmarks as PALcode yet, but found that it takes at least 13 <lb/>cycles just to invoke PALcode and return immediately from it. It is not possible to inline PALcode. <lb/>LL/STC: The Alpha architecture provides load-linked and store-conditionally instructions to implement <lb/>multiprocessor-safe shared data structures. We did not implement our benchmarks using these instruc-<lb/>tions but note that a single atomic word move between two memory locations already has the high <lb/>cost of 118 cycles. <lb/>The data in Table 1 shows that the overhead of sigprocmask is two orders of magnitude higher than <lb/>that of any of the other software based mutual exclusion schemes. Even if rollforward were expensive, the <lb/>software-based methods using rollforward would likely be more efficient overall. The table also indicates <lb/>that the rollforward approach is highly competitive even when compared to hardware-based methods. On <lb/>the Alpha, even though DI is slightly faster and CIPL is about equally fast as Hyb/Jump, it should be <lb/>stressed that the former two rely on CPU and system implementation specific details that are likely to change <lb/>frequently. The fastest architecturally defined hardware-based method on the Alpha is to implement each <lb/>atomic sequence as a separate PALcode function. As the data shows, Hyb/Jump is at least twice as fast <lb/>as PALcode. On the PA-RISC, Hyb/Jump performs even better. Only DI is slightly faster while all other <lb/>hardware-based techniques are slower by at least a factor of two. <lb/>Furthermore, it should be pointed out that many OS kernels use a function call to change the interrupt <lb/>priority level. As shown in row &quot;splx,&quot; this is rather expensive. Finally, as the last row indicates, a pair of <lb/>load-linked/store-conditionally instructions has a surprisingly high cost. Considering this and the rather long <lb/>list of conditions under which a store-conditionally is (almost) guaranteed to fail [7], this does not appear to <lb/>be an effective scheme to provide atomicity in a uniprocessor. <lb/>4.2 Overhead per Rollforward <lb/>The overhead per rollforward consists of two components: the time to check whether it is safe to do a <lb/>rollforward and the time to activate and return from the rollforward (i.e., switch context to the interrupted <lb/>process and regain control of the CPU). The second component is difficult to measure in a meaningful way <lb/>as its cost is highly dependent on the details of an implementation. Fortunately, if the rollforward handling <lb/>is placed early on in the interrupt handling, switching context to the interrupted process involves saving and <lb/>restoring only a minimal amount of processor state. That is, if implemented properly, this overhead should <lb/>quite small (compared to other interrupt-overheads). The first component can be measured easily and its <lb/>cost should remain comparable across different implementations and systems. It is non-zero if either the <lb/></body>

			<body>interrupt system does not trust in the pre-empted code or if the registration scheme has the potential for false <lb/>hits, that is, an interrupted sequence can be mistakenly identified as an atomic sequence. <lb/>A rollforward is safe if performing it will not take &quot;too much time&quot; (meet a certain deadline or, at least, <lb/>does not take forever) and if it ends with an instruction that will return control of the CPU to the interrupt <lb/>handler. It is a well-known result that the halting problem for any universal language is undecidable [21]. <lb/>It is therefore necessary to restrict the code in atomic sequences such that safety can be decided efficiently. <lb/>This is achieved by limiting the maximum length of the atomic sequence and imposing the rule that no <lb/>branch is allowed unless it can be statically determined that it branches forward and that it does not jump <lb/>outside the atomic sequence. Also, if the mechanism to relinquish control to the interrupt handler relies on a <lb/>well-known register (such as Dyn/Jump and Hyb/Jump), the code sequence must not attempt to modify the <lb/>well-known register. Uses of the well-known register are prohibited as well if the registration technique has <lb/>the potential for false hits (e.g., Hyb/Jump). Otherwise, rolling forward code that was mistakenly identified <lb/>as an atomic sequence could produce an incorrect result. Finally, to avoid security holes, the code should be <lb/>rolled forward in the context of the interrupted process instead of the context of the interrupt handler. <lb/>On the Alpha, we measured the worst-case time to check the safety of a code sequence. As described in <lb/>the previous paragraph, checking safety for the Hyb/Jump scheme represents the worst case, because it uses <lb/>a well-known register and it has the potential for false hits. During these measurements, the maximum length <lb/>of an atomic sequence was restricted to a conservative 32 instructions. For example, the atomic sequences <lb/>in the above benchmark programs are all shorter than 7 instructions when using the Hyb/Jump technique. <lb/>It is important to do measurements under realistic conditions. In particular, the memory system state <lb/>greatly influences the results. The DEC 3000/600 workstation has an 8 KB instruction cache, an 8 KB data <lb/>cache, and a 2 MB unified secondary cache. Suppose an interrupt handler has to check the safety of the code <lb/>starting at address A. Just prior to the interrupt, the CPU was executing in that address range. It is therefore <lb/>likely that the instructions around A are in the instruction as well as in the secondary level cache (the latter <lb/>is a superset of the primary caches [22]). As programs typically do not load data from the address range <lb/>they are executing in, it is unlikely that any of the instructions around A reside in the primary data cache. <lb/>We chose to perform our measurements in exactly this scenario: the instructions to be checked are all in the <lb/>secondary cache but none of them are in the data cache. <lb/>Our measurements indicate that the overhead O R to check the safety of a sequence that is N instructions <lb/>long is bounded as follows: <lb/>O R <lb/>73:375 cyc + N 25:375 cyc: <lb/>For example, checking the safety of a sequence that is 16 instructions long takes less than 480 cycles or, <lb/>at a clock rate of 175 MHz, less than 2:7 s. If the instructions reside in virtual memory and the data and <lb/>instruction translation buffers (TLBs) are separate, an additional cost of one data TLB miss may be incurred. <lb/>The exact cost of a TLB miss depends heavily on the organization of the page-tables and their state. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.3 Overall Benefit <lb/>Rollforward is an optimistic approach. It attempts to improve overall performance by optimizing the common <lb/>case at the cost of the, hopefully, rare case. This implies that the optimistic approach may fail if the rare <lb/>case occurs more frequently than anticipated. First, we provide a simple performance model that allows <lb/>to estimate whether rollforward will be beneficial. We then provide some system-level measurements that <lb/>were performed in an experimental kernel. <lb/>4.3.1 Performance Model <lb/>We assume an execution model in which interrupts occur at a fixed rate R I . Similarly, atomic sequences <lb/>are executed at a fixed rate R A and have a duration of D A cycles each. This is illustrated in Figure 1. If <lb/>D <lb/>A <lb/>t <lb/>I <lb/>1/R <lb/>A <lb/>1/R <lb/>interrupt <lb/>interrupt <lb/>atomic <lb/>sequence <lb/>Figure 1: Model of operation. <lb/>we assume that interrupts sample the interval 1=R A randomly, the probability of an interrupt pre-empting an <lb/>atomic sequence is R A D A . Suppose that rollforward has a fixed overhead of O S cycles per atomic sequence <lb/>and an overhead of O R cycles per rollforward. Note that we ignore the per interrupt overhead. This cost is so <lb/>small compared to the cost of fielding an interrupt and switching context that we believe this is justified (on <lb/>the system measured in Section 4.3.2, this overhead is roughly 20 instructions). Also, O R does not include <lb/>the time spent executing in the atomic sequence because a hardware-based scheme would have delayed the <lb/>interrupt by that much. On the other hand, the only overhead associated with a traditional approach, such <lb/>as disabling interrupts, is the one that arises per atomic sequence. We denote this by O H . Given these <lb/>definitions, it is easy to derive an equation for the maximum interrupt rate below which the software-based <lb/>approach is faster: <lb/>R I &lt; <lb/>O H ? O S <lb/>D A O R <lb/>: <lb/>Note that the right hand side is independent of the rate R A at which atomic sequences are executed. As R A <lb/>increases, the probability of interference-and with it the overhead-increases. However, because atomic <lb/>sequences are executed more frequently, the benefit of using a software-based mutual exclusion scheme <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>increases as well. Overall, the increase in overhead is balanced by a proportional increase in benefit and the <lb/>cross-over point remains the same. <lb/>For concreteness, we work out an example for the Alpha workstation using the Hyb/Jump implementation. <lb/>As reported in Table 1, O S is roughly 6 cycles when using the Hyb/Jump technique on the Alpha. Assume <lb/>that the maximum length of an atomic sequence is 32 instructions. The Alpha can issue up to two instructions <lb/>per cycle, but we conservatively assume an average execution rate of only 1 instruction per cycle giving a <lb/>D A of 32 cycles. Of the 32 instructions, we assume that, on average, half of them have to be rolled forward. <lb/>According to the measurements presented in the previous subsection, it takes at most 480 cycles to check <lb/>the safety of a code sequence that is 16 instructions long. Conservatively, we set O R = 480 cycles. On the <lb/>other side, the best architecturally defined hardware-based scheme on the Alpha is PALcode [7]. As shown <lb/>in Table 1, the overhead per PALcode invocation is at least 13 cycles. Optimistically, O H is 13 cycles. With <lb/>these values, we have: <lb/>R I &lt; <lb/>O H ? O S <lb/>D A O R <lb/>= 13 cyc ? 6 cyc <lb/>32 cyc 480 cyc <lb/>456 10 ?6 cyc ?1 : <lb/>At the machine&apos;s clock-rate of 175 MHz, this corresponds to an interrupt rate of approximately 80 kHz. <lb/>Under the given model, the software-based method therefore outperforms the hardware-based scheme with <lb/>any but the most severe interrupt loads. <lb/>4.3.2 System Measurements <lb/>We extended an experimental OS kernel with rollforward and measured its performance under different <lb/>loads. The Dyn/Jump scheme was used to register atomic sequences. The kernel does not currently support <lb/>paging, so page-faults were not an issue. For comparison, the same kernel was measured when using a <lb/>hardware-based scheme to protect atomic sequences. On the Alpha, this is implemented via two PALcode <lb/>calls per atomic sequence: one to raise and one to restore the interrupt priority level. The experiments were <lb/>performed on a 133MHz DEC 3000/400 workstation, which is slower than a DEC 3000/600. However, the <lb/>tests were small enough to fit in the secondary cache and the secondary cache performance scales with CPU <lb/>clock-frequency, so the relative behavior should be identical. The workloads are: <lb/>IDLE: There is one process executing a tight loop incrementing a counter. Throughput is measured as <lb/>the number of times the counter is incremented per 1000 cycles. This is a worst-case scenario for <lb/>rollforward since almost no atomic sequences are executed, while timer interrupts occur at a frequency <lb/>of 64 Hz. <lb/>BUSY1: Like IDLE, but the code incrementing the counter is now executed as an atomic sequence. This <lb/>is a best-case scenario for rollforward because atomic sequences are executed at the highest possible <lb/>frequency while interrupts occur at the relatively low frequency of 64 Hz. Notice that almost every <lb/>interrupt will lead to a rollforward in this case. <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>BUSY2: Like BUSY1, except that the loop overhead increased to about 300 cycles. This increase comes <lb/>from voluntarily yielding the processor once per loop. This was done to facilitate a fair comparison <lb/>with the next workload (ETH). Interrupt frequency is still 64 Hz. <lb/>ETH: A process executes the same atomic sequence as in the BUSY2 case. At the same time, minimum <lb/>sized Ethernet packets are exchanged between two machines. This increases interrupt frequency from <lb/>64 Hz to about 7:5 kHz. <lb/>The measured performance is summarized in Table 2. Column PAL reports the throughput for the kernel <lb/>using PALcode calls, while RF reports the throughput for the kernel using rollforward. <lb/>Throughput [incr/kcyc] <lb/>Load <lb/>PAL <lb/>RF <lb/>IDLE <lb/>166.0 166.0 <lb/>0% <lb/>BUSY1 <lb/>19.5 <lb/>55.4 +184% <lb/>BUSY2 <lb/>4.2 <lb/>5.1 <lb/>+21% <lb/>ETH <lb/>3.8 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>+13% <lb/>Table 2: Measured Overall-Performance <lb/>The IDLE row shows that the per-interrupt overhead for rollforward indeed is insignificant. Both <lb/>versions achieve a throughput of about 166 increments per 1000 instructions. The roughly 20 instructions <lb/>that the interrupt handler executes to check whether a rollforward is necessary can be interleaved with the <lb/>code that saves the machine state. Because the memory-system is the bottleneck at that point, executing <lb/>a few additional integer operations costs very little. The BUSY1 row shows that rollforward significantly <lb/>outperforms the PALcode-based kernel. In this case, throughput is almost 3 times higher-despite the fact <lb/>that almost every interrupt causes a rollforward. BUSY2 executes atomic sequences at a lower frequency <lb/>than BUSY1. Correspondingly, the performance advantage of rollforward drops to 21%. Comparing the <lb/>ETH row to BUSY2 shows that adding the Ethernet load reduces throughput in the PALcode-based kernel <lb/>by about 10%. The reduction in the rollforward case is with 16% somewhat higher. This can be explained <lb/>by the fact that interrupt frequency increased by about a factor of 117. Nevertheless, rollforward is still <lb/>faster by about 13%. <lb/>We make two final observations. First, in the ETH workload, the roundtrip time to exchange a packet <lb/>between the two machines was slightly better (by about 1%) with rollforward than when using PALcode. <lb/>Second, rollforward consistently showed a standard-deviation that was a factor of two smaller than PALcode. <lb/>Minimizing variance, as opposed to minimizing latency, is a performance goal that we expect to increase in <lb/>importance [23]. <lb/></body>

			<body>5 Related Work <lb/>As mentioned in the introduction, Bershad et al. propose a software-based technique for mutual exclusion <lb/>on uniprocessors [10]. It is based on rollback instead of rollforward and differs from the latter in several <lb/>specific ways. First, the solution is limited to atomic sequences that contain only a single write to shared <lb/>memory, whereas the rollforward approach permits multiple writes. It is often more convenient, and in the <lb/>end more efficient, to implement shared data-structures via sequences that require multiple writes to shared <lb/>memory [11]. <lb/>Second, rollforward supports efficient lock-free solutions, whereas rollback was designed for a lock-<lb/>based scenario. For uniprocessors, lock-free data-structures are interesting for four reasons: they can be <lb/>used to share data with interrupt handlers, there is no potential for deadlock, there is no locking overhead, <lb/>and non-updating operations can proceed and complete concurrently. These advantages apply to multi-<lb/>processors as well. However, as argued by Herlihy [12], the interest in multi-processor community appears <lb/>to be based mainly on the second property (absence of deadlock), which makes it easier to build machines <lb/>that are resilient against processor failures. <lb/>Third, dynamic registration schemes allow inlining of atomic sequences, whereas the static registration <lb/>scheme proposed in [10] severely restricts the number of atomic sequences. Similarly, designated sequences <lb/>are substantially easier to use with rollforward because false hits are acceptable. The bottom line is that <lb/>rollforward makes software-based mutual exclusion a much more easily applicable technique. <lb/>Rollforward has been used successfully in the VAX runtime system of the Trellis/Owl language [16]. <lb/>There, rollforward was implemented by emulating the instructions from the point of interruption to the end <lb/>of the atomic sequence. We do not believe that emulation is feasible in the applications we envision. The <lb/>complexity and overheads involved would be simply too big. Another shortcoming is that the Trellis/Owl <lb/>work does not address any of the operating system issues raised by rollforward. Being a language system, it <lb/>is unclear whether the same techniques could be generalized to other languages or supported in a language-<lb/>independent manner. <lb/>Rollforward is also mentioned in [15]. That work appears to dismiss rollforward as a practical solution <lb/>for two reasons: (a) execution of code on behalf of another thread and (b) page faults. It is true that executing <lb/>code on behalf of another thread is difficult. However, we contend that it is feasible and efficient to let <lb/>rollforward occur in the preempted process&apos;s context simply by ensuring-for example, via code-inspection <lb/>or a watch-dog timer-that it will relinquish control of the CPU in a timely manner. Also, we discussed <lb/>scenarios in which page faults do not pose a problem and proposed several solutions on how page faults <lb/>could be handled in an environment in which they are not transparent. <lb/>Another system that employed rollforward is Scheduler Activations [17]. Unlike Trellis/Owl, it does not <lb/>use rollforward to achieve mutual exclusion. Instead, it is used to avoid deadlock. Scheduler Activations use <lb/>lock-based synchronization. For performance and liveness reasons, it is undesirable to suspend a process <lb/>while it is holding a lock. One could either avoid this situation or recover from it. Scheduler Activations <lb/>take the latter approach. That is, whenever a process is suspended while holding a lock, it is rolled forward to <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>the point where it releases the lock. Even though the reason for rollforward is very different from achieving <lb/>mutual exclusion, the implementation the authors describe is not limited to Scheduler Activations. The <lb/>paper gives only a superficial treatment of the issues involved. It does not give any indications as to the cost <lb/>or limitations of rollforward. <lb/>Finally, Stodolsky et al. [9] present a technique called optimistic interrupt protection. The idea is to use <lb/>delayed (lazy) evaluation to reduce the number of times that expensive interrupt level changing instructions <lb/>have to be invoked. It is interesting to note that the implementation of this technique is one particular <lb/>realization of the more general rollforward technique. Due to the entirely different focus, that work makes <lb/>no attempt to generalize the technique into a synchronization mechanism that is useful outside the privileged <lb/>kernel of an operating system. As a matter of fact, the paper does not make a connection between optimistic <lb/>interrupt protection and rollforward. <lb/>6 Concluding Remarks <lb/>This article describes a rollforward-based technique to implement atomic sequences on a uniprocessor. Both, <lb/>micro-and macro-experiments show our approach to be as efficient as, and in many cases significantly more <lb/>efficient than, hardware-based mutual exclusion mechanisms. Rollforward is more flexible than schemes <lb/>based on rollback in that it allows multiple writes. Atomic sequences with multiple writes can be used <lb/>to construct powerful primitives which, in turn, can be used to simplify the implementation of lock-free <lb/>data-structures. We conclude this article by making some observations about the mechanism. <lb/>First, we described that page faults present a bigger challenge with rollforward than with rollback. With <lb/>rollback, page faults are a problem only if an interrupt handler needs to inspect the interrupted code in <lb/>order to determine whether it interrupted an atomic sequence [10]. With rollforward, there is the additional <lb/>potential for a page fault during recovery. While this may pose a serious limitation in certain environments, <lb/>we discussed several possible solutions and also showed that page faults are not an issue in at least two <lb/>important cases: in-kernel synchronization and protection against Unix-style signal handlers. On the other <lb/>hand rollforward makes it much easier to use designated sequences because false hits are tolerable. The <lb/>Hyb/Jump techniques fully exploits this property. <lb/>Second, even if a hardware-based mechanism is more efficient, a software-based method may be <lb/>preferable because it is applicable in unprivileged user-mode. This is particularly useful for software that <lb/>may execute either in user-level or kernel-level mode. For example, OS servers may be developed and <lb/>debugged in user-level space but moved into the kernel for a production environment. <lb/>Third, the ability to inline atomic sequences is important. Many modern machines use direct-mapped <lb/>caches. Thus, every branch to a subroutine has the potential to evict cache lines due to collisions. For <lb/>example, we reported the PALcode invocation overhead on the Alpha as 13 cycles (see Section 4). In <lb/>practice, this overhead is often in the 30 cycle range due to cache effects (PALcode is located at a platform-<lb/>dependent fixed address and therefore not inlinable). As the gap between memory system and CPU <lb/></body>

			<body>performance continues to grow [18, 24], techniques that yield good cache performance will become ever <lb/>more important. Software-based methods that use designated sequences, a dynamic, or hybrid scheme to <lb/>register atomic sequences can all be inlined easily. <lb/>Fourth, our experience is that rollforward is very practical. All of our methods can be implemented <lb/>via a simple C pre-processor macro with the GNU C compiler. These macros take a single argument: a <lb/>sequence of instructions that should be executed atomically. As each macro presents the same interface, <lb/>software implementing atomic sequences can be written independently of which mutual exclusion scheme <lb/>is actually used. GNU C is powerful enough to allow writing the macros in a manner that is safe even when <lb/>code optimizations are applied. This is a crucial feature. Without it, inlining of atomic sequences could not <lb/>be done safely. Another demonstration of practicality is that it is surprisingly easy to implement rollforward <lb/>recovery in the context of Unix signal processing. We used a slight variation of the Dyn/Jump technique to <lb/>implement a &quot;fast signals&quot; package (sigprocmask and its associated functions). Except for a few details, the <lb/>implementation provides Unix semantics at a fraction of the cost of the traditional implementation involving <lb/>a system call. 3 <lb/>Fifth, we enumerate a few applications of rollforward. As the technique is non-blocking, it can be <lb/>used to share data between interrupt handlers and normal kernel mode or even user mode code. Also, it is <lb/>directly applicable if page-faults are impossible (e.g., non-pageable part of an OS kernel) or if page-faults <lb/>are transparent (e.g., within single Unix process). As discussed in Section 2, there are a number of ways to <lb/>make rollforward work even if page-faults are not transparent. Once again, each solution provides a different <lb/>tradeoff between flexibility and performance. Finally, the application where this technique can be applied <lb/>most readily and extract the largest performance benefit is in Unix processes that frequently execute code <lb/>that needs to be protected from asynchronously executing signal handlers. <lb/>Sixth, the performance model and system measurements presented in Section 4.3 show that the benefit <lb/>of rollforward increases with the frequency at which atomic sequences execute. Given the small overhead of <lb/>dynamic registration, this encourages building systems with fine-grained synchronization. That is, instead <lb/>of few large atomic sequences, it will usually be better to structure the system using several small ones. <lb/>Not only does this reduce average interrupt latency, but it also implies that the system will be structured in <lb/>a manner that is more suitable for shared-memory parallel machines, where small atomic sequences mean <lb/>increased concurrency and thus a potential for increased overall performance. A good example is the user-<lb/>level implementation of POSIX threads presented in [25]. Concerns about the overhead of signal-masking <lb/>led to a design using one big monitor rather than small atomic sequences. As a result, a major redesign <lb/>will be necessary should this package ever be extended to support multiprocessors. With rollforward, signal <lb/>masking costs could have been reduced by an order of magnitude and would have led to a design that more <lb/>naturally exhibits the inherent synchronization requirements of the package. <lb/>Finally, there are a number of low-level issues that arise when implementing an interrupt handler that <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 The limitation of the user-level implementation of sigprocmask is that signal stacks are unsupported. Also, no attempt was <lb/>made to emulate the semantics for signals that can stop a process (e.g., SIGTSTP, SIGTTOU, and SIGTTIN). <lb/></note>

			<body>supports software mutual exclusion. They are not particularly difficult to solve but we would like to conclude <lb/>by mentioning one. The question is whether a processor should disable all interrupts when dispatching to a <lb/>handler or just some of them. It is intuitive that the code that checks for and initiates a rollforward is itself an <lb/>atomic sequence. If a processor disables all interrupts before dispatching to this code, there is no problem. <lb/>However, if only some interrupts are disabled, it is necessary to guarantee the atomicity via software. An <lb/>interrupt handler could disable all remaining interrupts as quickly as possible, but this still leaves a small <lb/>window during which an interrupt handler could be pre-empted. An interrupt-handler therefore has to check <lb/>whether it interrupted another handler and, if so, take the appropriate recovery action. While not extremely <lb/>difficult, this is clearly more complicated than if the number of outstanding interrupts were limited to one. <lb/>For software mutual exclusion, it is therefore desirable that the processor invokes an interrupt handler with <lb/>all interrupts disabled. This is the case for PA-RISC 1.1 but not for an Alpha using either the VMS or DEC <lb/>UNIX PALcode. However, because PALcode is easy to replace-it is copied from non-volatile memory to <lb/>normal RAM at boottime-this deficiency is easily corrected. As a matter of fact, it is even possible to move <lb/>the software mutual exclusion part of an interrupt handler entirely into PALcode. From an operating system <lb/>perspective, it would then appear as if software mutual exclusion were a part of the Alpha architecture. <lb/></body>
