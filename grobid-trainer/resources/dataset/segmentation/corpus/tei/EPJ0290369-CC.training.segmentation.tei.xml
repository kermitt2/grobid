In the underdoped regime, the large magnetoresistance is only present <lb/>when at low temperatures superconductivity occurs. T he strong magnetoresistivity, which persists <lb/>even at temperatures far above T c , can be related to the pairs forming eventually the superconducting <lb/>state below T c .

			<body>Introduction <lb/>One of the unusual features of high T c layered superconductors is the opening of a pseudo-gap in the <lb/>electronic energy spectrum at a temperature T * far above the critical temperature T c . Although the existence <lb/>of the pseudo-gap is commonly accepted and confirmed by several experimental techniques such as nuclear <lb/>magnetic resonance (NMR), tunneling spectroscopy, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) <lb/>and electronic Raman scattering [1], the origin of the pseudo-gap is still not revealed. T he intriguing <lb/>question is whether the pseudogap and the superconducting gap have a common origin. If they are related, <lb/>the pseudogap might be associated with the presence of electronic pairs above T c . From this point of view, <lb/>superconductivity occurs when the phase of these pairs becomes coherent and not when they are first formed <lb/>in the phase incoherent state [2]. T he idea of a precursory pair formation at relatively high temperatures <lb/>T c &lt; T &lt; T * and its relevance for high T c superconductivity is supported by the experimental observation that <lb/>the pseudogap evolves into the superconducting gap at low temperatures, as clearly demonstrated by <lb/>scanning tunneling spectroscopy [3]. Moreover, the ARPES data [4,5] indicate that the pseudo-and the <lb/>superconducting gap both have d-wave symmetry. T he fact that the T *(p)-and the T c (p)-lines merge in the <lb/>overdoped regime [6], with p the hole density, may explain the difficulty to observe a pseudogap in the <lb/>strongly overdoped case. If preformed pairs exist, they should also influence the normal state transport <lb/>properties of high T c superconductors at temperatures T c &lt; T &lt; T *. Our paper is focussed on the in-plane <lb/>magnetoresistivity of the prototype system La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 that covers completely both the underdoped <lb/>(x&lt;0.15) and the overdoped (x&gt;0.15) regimes. T he results from earlier reports on the magnetoresistivity of <lb/>this system are rather contradictory: a negative magnetoresistivity has been obtained from pulsed field <lb/>transport measurements [7]; a positive [8,9,10] as well as a negative magnetoresistivity [11] has been <lb/>reported from DC field measurements. <lb/>In this article, we present magnetoresistivity data of La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 epitaxial thin films measured in <lb/>pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T and in the temperature range from room temperature down to 4.2 K. It is <lb/>important to note that the magnetic field will not only destroy superconductivity but can affect, at the same <lb/>time, the scattering mechanisms in the normal state. Moreover, it is not known how the new sorts of <lb/>quasiparticles, introduced by theorists to explain the pseudogap phase, behave in an applied magnetic field. <lb/></body>

			<body>T herefore, the study of the field-dependence of the resistivity is indispensable in that respect. By <lb/>systematically changing the hole concentration through the variation of the Sr-content, x, we have found that <lb/>superconductivity at low temperatures (T &lt; T c ) and a considerable positive magnetoresistivity at high <lb/>temperatures (T &gt;&gt; T c ) both appear at the same Sr-content, thus relating the large magnetoresistance with <lb/>superconductivity. We will present clear evidence for precursor effects from the high field transport data. <lb/>Expe rime ntal re sults <lb/>T he as-grown films were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering from stoichiometric targets [12,13]. The <lb/>magnetoresistivity measurements were carried out at the pulsed field facility of the Katholieke Universiteit <lb/>Leuven [14,15] by using a homemade flow-cryostat and 50 T coil. All data reported in this paper were <lb/>obtained on thin films (~150 nm), patterned (1000 x 50 µm strip) for four probe measurements in the <lb/>transverse geometry (µ H ⊥ I) with the magnetic field perpendicular to the film (µ 0 H // c) and the current <lb/>sent along the ab-plane (I // ab). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figures 1 to 8 present the ρ ab (µ o H) curves measured at temperatures varying from T &gt;&gt; T c down to 4.2 K for <lb/>the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 thin films with Sr content x = 0.045, 0.050, 0.055, 0.060, 0.100, 0.200, 0.250 and 0.270. <lb/>La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 <lb/>T he La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 sample (Figure 1) shows a very weak magnetoresistivity (less than 2 % at 45 T) in <lb/>the whole temperature range. T his is clearly demonstrated by the graphs A, B, C and D in the middle part of <lb/>Figure 1, which present the weak, in a first approximation, quadratic magnetoresistivity at the selected <lb/>temperatures 16 K, 20 K, 32 K and 176 K. No smoothing has been applied to the data, and both raising and <lb/>lowering field branches are shown. T he magnetoresistivity, indicated in the graphs is defined as <lb/>MR = (ρ ab (50 T ) -ρ(0 T ))/ρ(0 T ). <lb/>T he in-plane resistivity ρ ab (T) as a function of temperature at zero magnetic field is shown in Figure 1 <lb/>at the right side of the upper frame; it serves to better orientate the magnetoresistivity measurements. The open <lb/>circles denote the values of the resistivity at zero magnetic field, derived from pulsed field measurements. <lb/>Since La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 exhibits, below T MI ~ 100 K, a resistivity that strongly diverges when lowering the <lb/>temperature (e.g. dρ/dT(4.2 K) ≈ -800 µΩcm/K), even minor heating effects in the pulsed field experiment can <lb/>artificially lead to negative magnetoresistivity effects at low temperatures. We judged that the <lb/>magnetoresistivity of La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 at temperatures T &gt; 14 K could be adequately measured up to 50 T in <lb/>our setup. Indeed, no discrepancies between data taken during the rising and the lowering branch of the field <lb/>pulse could be found in this temperature range, a strong indication that heating effects do not influence the <lb/>results. Additional measurements in DC fields up to 8 T (not shown in this article), convincingly proved that <lb/>the resistivity of the sample is only slightly magnetic field dependent below 14 K as well. <lb/>La 1.95 Sr 0.05 CuO 4 <lb/>Upon approaching the insulator-superconductor transition in the (T,x)-phase diagram (x = 0.055), a <lb/>considerable positive magnetoresistivity appears (Figure 2). A magnetic field of 45 T causes an excess <lb/>resistivity of 10 % in La 1.95 Sr 0.05 CuO 4 at a temperature of 10 K. With increasing temperature, the <lb/>magnetoresistivity of the sample at 45 T goes down to a final decrease below 2 % around 40 K. Note that <lb/>La 1.95 Sr 0.05 CuO 4 does not show a sign of superconductivity at zero magnetic field down to 1.5 K, the lowest <lb/>temperature investigated. In contrast, the sample demonstrates an insulator-like behavior (dρ ab /dT &lt; 0) from <lb/>80.5 K (T MI ) down to the lowest temperature. For clarity, only the data taken during rising magnetic field are <lb/>shown in graphs A, B, C, and D of Figure 2. T he overview graph in the upper frame of Figure 2 depicts, at <lb/>the different temperatures, the data at zero field (open circles) and at 45 T (solid circles). <lb/>La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO 4 <lb/>Figure 3 illustrates that La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO 4 , situated at the border of the superconducting phase, <lb/>manifests strong magnetoresistivity effects. At 4.2 K, the magnetoresistivity at 45 T is 33 %; its value at <lb/>9.4 K is 18 %. Although situated very close to the insulator-superconductor transition, La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO 4 has <lb/>a robust insulator-like behavior from 72.7 K (T MI ) down to 1.5 K at zero magnetic field, seemingly not to be <lb/>correlated with the occurrence of superconductivity. T he graphs A, B, C, D, E and F in the lower part of <lb/>
            Figure 3 give a clear presentation of the evolution of the resistivity with magnetic field for the <lb/>La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO 4 sample. At low temperatures (4.2 K), a saturating ρ(µ 0 H) behavior is observed. For <lb/>intermediate temperatures (20.7 K), a quadratic magnetoresistivity at low fields evolves into a behavior that <lb/>tends to saturate at higher fields. Only a quadratic behavior of the magnetoresistivity remains at sufficiently <lb/>high temperatures (47.7 K). Graphs A, B, C and D only show the data taken during the increasing branch of <lb/>the magnetic field pulse. <lb/>La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 <lb/>In the La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 compound (Figure 4), the insulating phase at low temperatures gives way to <lb/>superconductivity below T c = 2.4 K. T he rather low critical temperature T c = 2.4 K implies that the sample is <lb/>located very close to the insulator-superconductor transition. From figure 4 it is clear that the <lb/>magnetoresistivity effects become very pronounced upon increasing the charge carrier concentration through <lb/>the superconducting phase. At 4.2 K, which is nearly two times T c , a field of 45 T causes a magnetoresistivity <lb/>of 330 % in La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 . Note that the resistivity is not even fully saturated at 45 T. Upon increasing the <lb/>temperature, the impact of the magnetic field on the resistivity diminishes, resulting in a crossing of the <lb/>ρ ab (µ o H) curves taken at temperatures below T MI = 63 K. T he fact that the ρ ab (µ o H) curves cross each other <lb/>reflects that the ground state at low temperatures, obscured below T c by the superconducting phase, has an <lb/>insulating character in La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 . T his observation is in agreement with the results reported previous in <lb/>[7, 16] on underdoped superconducting La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 single crystals. T he temperature dependence of the <lb/>resistivity at 45 T is shown at the right side of the upper frame of Figure 4 by black circles. Below the metal-<lb/>to-insulator transition at T MI = 63 K, the resistivity at 45 T exhibits insulating properties (dρ ab /dT &lt; 0). The <lb/>graphs A, B, C, D, E and F show the functional dependence of the resistivity versus field in detail. T he <lb/>magnetoresistivity tends to saturate at low temperatures (4.2 K). Similar to the La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO compound <lb/>(Figure 3), this behavior gradually evolves into a quadratic dependence (50 K) upon increasing the temperature. <lb/>T o a lower extent, this behavior can be as well seen in the La 1.95 Sr 0.05 CuO 4 sample presented in Figure 2. <lb/>La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 <lb/>
            T he magnetoresistivity in La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 (T c = 17.5 K) is shown in Figure 5. Again, the study in high magnetic <lb/>fields reveals an insulating ground state (dρ ab /dT &lt; 0) behind the superconducting phase, which is hidden in <lb/>zero magnetic field. T he use of high magnetic fields allows us to determine the metal to insulator transition <lb/>temperature T MI = 56 K. Below T MI = 56 K, the ρ ab (µ o H) curves cross each other. It looks like the curves <lb/>have a single intersection in the graph at the left side of the upper frame of Figure 5. However, an enlarged <lb/>view of this field region indicates that the crossing shifts systematically to higher fields when lowering the <lb/>temperature. Graphs A, B, C, D, E and F in Figure 5 provide a closer look upon the field dependence of the <lb/>resistivity in La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 at the selected temperatures 4.2 K, 12 K, 18 K, 30 K, 71 K and 132.7 K. Below <lb/>T c = 17.5 K, the magnetoresistivity tends to saturate. Nevertheless, a complete saturation is still absent at all <lb/>temperatures. At the same time, the ρ ab (µ 0 H) curves do not exhibit a knee-shaped feature, marking the <lb/>position of the second critical field (H c2 ). Above T c = 17.5 K, the magnetoresistivity exhibits a familiar <lb/>behavior: it tends to saturate at low temperatures (18 K), a quadratic dependence at low fields bends down <lb/>with increasing field at intermediate temperatures (30 K) and a weak quadratic dependence remains at high <lb/>temperatures (71 K). T he magnetoresistivity at 45 T decreases from 30 % at 30 K down to below 2 % above <lb/>71 K. At high temperatures, for example 132.7 K, the magnetoresistivity for the superconducting <lb/>La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 sample is comparable to that of the distinctly non-superconducting La 1.955 Sr 0.045 -CuO 4 <lb/>(Figure 1). <lb/>La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 <lb/>In contrast to the underdoped samples, the overdoped La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 (T c = 22.8 K) demonstrates <lb/>clear knee-shaped features in its field-dependent resistivity curves ρ ab (µ o H) at temperatures T &lt; T c (see <lb/>graphs A, B and C of Figure 6). As a consequence, the superconducting transitions and the second critical <lb/>field H c2 (T) can be determined for La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 . Above H c2 (T), the resistivity still depends on the magnetic <lb/>field. At the same time, the overdoped La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 shows magnetoresistivity, far above T c , dying out with <lb/>increasing temperature, similar to the superconducting underdoped samples La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 and <lb/>La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 . However, the functional dependence of the magnetoresistivity changed while crossing the <lb/>threshold of optimal doping. No tendency towards saturation has been observed in the magnetoresistivity of <lb/>La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 , at temperatures well above the superconducting to normal transition. T his is illustrated by <lb/>
            graphs D and E in Figure 6. A linear dependence of the resistivity with respect to the field is found at low <lb/>temperatures (30.6 K). At higher temperatures (79.6 K), a quadratic behavior is predominant. La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 <lb/>exhibits a minimum in ρ ab (T) at T MI = 40 K and a crossover from metallic to insulator-like behavior upon a <lb/>temperature decrease, in a high magnetic field of 45 T . A low temperature insulating behavior persisting up <lb/>to optimal doping is reported both for La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 single crystals [16] and for the electron-doped <lb/>superconductor Pr 2-x Ce x CuO 4 [17]. In Bi 2 Sr 2-x -La x CuO 6+δ , it disappears at 1/8 hole doping, in the <lb/>underdoped regime [18]. Our results on thin films, on the other hand, show a metal to insulator-like <lb/>transition in La 1,8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 , stretching well into the overdoped regime. <lb/>La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 <lb/>T he resistivity data for the strongly overdoped La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 compound (T c = 15.6 K) is shown in Figure 7 as a <lb/>function of the magnetic field. T he data for both branches of the field pulse are presented and no smoothing has <lb/>been applied. T he La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 sample shows various kinds of superconducting transitions. While close to T c , the <lb/>ρ ab (µ o H) transition is narrow, it broadens significantly when lowering the temperature. This indicates that the <lb/>irreversibility line H irr (T) and the second critical field H c2 (T) gradually separate from each other. The graphs A, B <lb/>and C of Figure 7 illustrate that the resistivity of La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 is linearly depending on the field above the <lb/>critical fields. Above T c (= 15.6 K), La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 still demonstrates a considerable quadratic <lb/>magnetoresistivity but the ρ ab (µ o H)-curves lack any sign of saturation. Surprisingly, our high field studies <lb/>disclose a metal to insulator transition around 10 K (T MI ) in La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 . Although this sample is <lb/>situated deeply in the overdoped regime, the resistivity values at 50 T demonstrate a distinct upturn when <lb/>lowering the temperature below T MI . T his insulator-like behavior at low temperatures could be related to a <lb/>weak pseudogap feature present even in this compound, or to disorder effects. <lb/>La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 <lb/>Finally, Figure 8 contains the field dependent in-plane resistivity data of La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 (T c = 9.2 K), our <lb/>strongest overdoped sample in this study. T he superconducting transitions are clear and sharp, just like in <lb/>La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 . Since La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 has, of all our samples, the lowest normal state resistivity, the <lb/>mechanical vibrations, caused by the high field-pulses, have a stronger impact on its resistivity data. The <lb/>effects of the vibrations, particularly present during the lowering branch of the pulse, are clearly visible in <lb/>the data taken at 12 K and 54 K, respectively shown in graphs B and D in Figure 8. T he other <lb/>magnetoresistivity curves, presented in Figure 8, contain only the data taken during increasing magnetic field <lb/>for clarity. In contrast with the previous samples, the ρ ab (µ o H)-curves of La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 do not cross each <lb/>other at fields below 45 T . Above T c , the magnetic field dependences of the resistivity are essentially <lb/>quadratic, thus without tendency towards saturation. <lb/>In the field and temperature range used in our experiments, the magnetoresistivity is positive for all our <lb/>films, in agreement with the results of [19, 20, 21]. Our data on thin films differ from the results of <lb/>references [7, 16] on single crystals of La 2-x Sr x -CuO 4 with x = 0.08 and x = 0.13, where the <lb/>magnetoresistivity in the limit of high fields was found to be negative. <lb/>
            Discussion <lb/>In the analysis of superconducting fluctuations the need to separate fluctuation and normal-state <lb/>conductivity contributions in the analysis is eminent. T his is a particularly difficult task in high-T c <lb/>superconductors, because both their normal state and their superconducting behavior are not yet understood. <lb/>In what follows, we present a possible analysis of the magnetoresistivity data of the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 thin films. <lb/>Our observations give new and strong evidence for stripe formation in underdoped samples. <lb/>Absence of magnetoresistivvity in non-superconducting underdoped La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 <lb/>Figure 1 (lower frame) presents the in-plane magnetoresistivity data for the non-superconducting <lb/>La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 sample in a so-called Kohler-plot ((ρ-ρ 0 )/ρ 0 vs B 2 ). T he figure suggests that its resistivity <lb/>is proportional to H 2 at all temperatures. Kohler&apos;s rule [22] is however only valid when all the curves <lb/>coincide. We see that the curves at 87 K and 176 K nicely overlap but that the low temperature data deviate. <lb/>A violation of Kohler&apos;s rule at low temperatures can be expected for this compound since its low temperature <lb/>region is characterized by variable range hopping conductivity. It is most unlikely that one can describe the <lb/>charge transport in this temperature regime by a rule, based on a classical Boltzmann theory for metals. <lb/>Magnetoresistivity of La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 close to the insulator-superconductor transition <lb/>T he lower frames of Figures 2 and 3, show the Kohler plots for the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 samples with x = 0.05 and 0.055, <lb/>situated very close to the insulator to superconductor transition. A considerable excess magnetoresistivity, which <lb/>depends not quadratically on the magnetic field but rather tends to saturate, appears at low temperatures. This <lb/>contribution becomes more pronounced when increasing the charge carrier concentration through the <lb/>superconducting phase, as evidenced by the Kohler plots for La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 (T c = 2.4 K) and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO <lb/>(T c = 17.5 K), presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. T his evolution strongly suggests that the non-quadratic <lb/>contribution to the magnetoresistivity can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. <lb/>In zero magnetic field, La 1.95 Sr 0.05 CuO 4 and La 1.945 Sr 0.055 CuO 4 demonstrate an insulator-like behavior <lb/>(dρ ab /dT &gt; 0) at low temperatures down to at least 1.5 K. Nevertheless, the superconducting fluctuations <lb/>appear up to tens of Kelvin. For the superconducting samples La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 , the <lb/>fluctuations extend over a temperature range, which exceeds several times T c . For example: the <lb/>La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 compound shows at 25 K (seven times T c !) a magneto-resistivity of 8 % at T , which is <lb/>substantially higher than the ~ 1 % for the non-superconducting La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 sample. The fluctuations <lb/>are moreover of an unusual strength: typical fields for a complete suppression of fluctuations in conventional <lb/>BCS bulk superconductors should not exceed the paramagnetic limiting field µ o H = 1.38 T c . However, the <lb/>La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 system shows, at 4.2 K, a magnetoresistivity that is not even saturated at 50 T, a value which <lb/>is more than a decade higher than the conventional paramagnetic limit of µ o H = 4 T for this sample with T c ~ <lb/>2.4K. <lb/>Influence of the normal state magnetoresistivity for (strongly) overdoped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4. <lb/>T he lower frames of figures 6-8 present the Kohler plots for the overdoped samples La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 <lb/>(T c = 22.8 K), La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 (T c = 15.6 K) and La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 (T c = 9.2 K). We see that the part of the <lb/>magnetoresistivity, which has no quadratic behaviour with respect to the applied field diminishes upon <lb/>increasing the charge carrier concentration and becomes finally undetectable in the La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 sample. <lb/>
            T his observation can be consistently interpreted in the context of our previous results that the one-<lb/>dimensional character of the charge transport (stripes) fades away upon doping [23]. As the dimensionality <lb/>of the electrical transport increases from 1D to 2D (or 3D), the fluctuations should indeed become less <lb/>pronounced. T he evidences for stripe formation from magnetoresistivity measurements are discussed further <lb/>below (see eq. (1)). <lb/>So far, we have ignored the part of the magnetoresistivity that appears in a Kohler plot as a straight line. In <lb/>Figure 8, we see that magnetic field dependencies of the La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 -data are essentially H 2 up to 45 T. <lb/>Moreover, the straight lines coincide, which implies that H/ρ o scales the magnetoresistivity and hence that <lb/>the classical Kohler&apos;s rule is for valid in La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 . Its magnetoresistivity can safely be attributed to <lb/>the normal state. T he data for the other strongly overdoped sample, La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 , follows Kohler&apos;s rule <lb/>above 30 K. For the superconducting samples with a lower Sr content (Figures 2 to 6, lower frames), the <lb/>dependence with (H/ρ o ) 2 remains linear over a wide temperature range (far above T c ) but the slopes increase <lb/>when lowering the temperature. T he deviations are more pronounced in the underdoped samples. Many <lb/>authors observed this apparent violation of Kohler&apos;s rule in high-T c systems and speculated its origin [24, 19, <lb/>20, 25, 26, 27]. In early reports, it was assumed that the violation of Kohler&apos;s rule reflected the influence of <lb/>superconducting fluctuations [20, 25]. However, the observed temperature or field dependences could not be <lb/>reproduced in any fluctuation theory. <lb/>At a later stage, the effect has been explained as a normal state effect, caused by the presence of two separate <lb/>relaxation times in the normal state [19]. T his idea relies on the resonating valence bond model, in which <lb/>spin and charge are separated and are described by spinon and holon quasiparticles [28]. Within this concept <lb/>the relaxation times for carrier motion normal to the Fermi surface and parallel to it are different. T he <lb/>former, τ tr , is the usual transport relaxation time. It is related to the spinon-holon scattering, which leads to a <lb/>linear T dependence of the resistivity, i.e., τ tr <lb/>-1 ∝ T. T he latter, τ H , is the transverse (Hall) relaxation time. It <lb/>is the result of the spinon-spinon scattering that varies as T 2 like any other fermion-fermion interaction. <lb/>According to the theory, the magnetoresistivity should be proportional to the square of the Hall angle θ H . <lb/>However, the experiments of Balakirev [26] and Abe [27], respectively on La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 thin films and <lb/>La 1.905 Ba 0.095 CuO 4 single crystals, convincingly proved that the latter dependence does not hold. Both authors <lb/>considered the failure of Kohler&apos;s rule as an anomalous aspect of the normal-state transport in high-T c systems. <lb/>According to our data, a large positive magnetoresistivity that tends to saturate at high magnetic fields, <lb/>appears at low temperatures when crossing the Sr content through the insulator-superconductor transition. <lb/>T his tendency can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. As follows from the data on La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4 , <lb/>the normal-state magnetoresistivity starts to play a considerable role at higher Sr contents. <lb/>One dimensional character of the superconducting fluctuations in underdoped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 <lb/>We believe that an adequate theory to describe the magnetoresistivity in high-T c systems should <lb/>account for the inhomogeneous distribution of spin-rich and charge-rich areas, i.e. with the presence of <lb/>stripes (1-D charge areas) [30]. It is apparent from our data that the violation of Kohler&apos;s rule and the <lb/>superconducting fluctuations are much more pronounced in pseudogapped systems, where stripes are <lb/>formed. Although stripes are well established experimentally, they are, up to now, strongly neglected by <lb/>theoreticians working on magnetoresistivity effects. <lb/>Figure 9 shows the magnetoconductivity ∆σ = (σ(0 T ) -σ(50 T )) as a function of the temperature, both <lb/>presented in logarithmic coordinates for La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 (T c = 2.4 K) and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 (T c = 17.5 K). Data <lb/>were taken in the temperature range 7.7 K -125 K and 20 K -132 K respectively. We observe a lowering of <lb/>
            the magnetoresistivity with temperature following a similar power-law for both samples. Surprisingly, the <lb/>value of the power 1.54 is close to 3/2, which corresponds, according to the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) [43] <lb/>expression (eq. 1) to superconducting fluctuations with a one-dimensional character! <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>3~  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>− <lb/>∆ <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>− <lb/>∆ <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>− <lb/>∆ <lb/>c <lb/>c <lb/>D <lb/>c <lb/>c <lb/>D <lb/>c <lb/>c <lb/>D <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>(1) <lb/>T he nice correspondence with the 1D AL expression is an important result since both samples have a very <lb/>different critical temperature. T he dimensionality derived from the paraconductivity is moreover in good <lb/>agreement with stripe models. T o obtain the result of Figure 9 for La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 , we <lb/>neglected the influence of the normal state on the magnetoresistivity. Most probably, the normal-state contribution <lb/>is as small as the magnetoresistivity of the heavily underdoped La 1.955 Sr 0.045 CuO 4 compound: of the order of 1 %, <lb/>which justifies our procedure. <lb/>Since the contrast of the stripes with respect to their surrounding decreases upon doping, the dimensionality of the <lb/>charge-transport in the overdoped samples is not well defined. Although La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 and La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 reveal <lb/>distinct pseudogap features, they partially recover a 2D (or 3D) character. It is therefore not surprising that the <lb/>magnetoconductivity of the overdoped samples could not be fitted with a simple power law with respect to the <lb/>temperature. Secondly, the data for the overdoped samples are noisier because of their low resistivity, which <lb/>complicates an analysis like the one presented in Figure 9. Moreover, as follows from the data on <lb/>La 1.73 Sr 0.27 CuO 4, the normal-state contribution to the magnetoresistivity cannot be neglected in samples with a high <lb/>doping level. At the moment, there is however no theory available, allowing an accurate evaluation of this normal-<lb/>state background. It is even not &apos;a priori&apos; clear whether the violation of Kohler&apos;s rule should be attributed to <lb/>fluctuations or to the normal state (or to both). For example, if the mobile stripes bend in a magnetic field, they <lb/>may influence the normal state magnetoresistivity in an unconventional way. In this context, we would like to <lb/>mention the result of Ando and coworkers [29], who have reported a possible influence on the striped structure <lb/>in non-superconducting underdoped cuprates by a magnetic field, in the configuration where the magnetic field <lb/>is applied parallel to the ab-plane. Kimura et al. [20] found a strong suppression of the magnetoresistivity in <lb/>La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 around the hole concentration with x = 1/8, a concentration that is related to a more static nature <lb/>of the stripes [30]. T heir results are at least a manifestation of the importance of the striped structure in the <lb/>analysis of magnetoresistivity measurements. <lb/>Role of the pseudogap and pre-pair electronic states <lb/>T he pseudogap is emerging as an important indicator revealing the nature of the superconductivity as well as <lb/>the normal state in our high-T c samples. A possible scenario relates the pseudogap with the presence of <lb/>electronic pair states far above T c [30 -36]. T he idea is that Cooper pairs are formed at a temperature T * far <lb/>above T c, but bulk phase coherent superconductivity is only established when long-range phase coherence is <lb/>obtained below T c . T he models, which are based on this precursor superconductivity scenario, get growing <lb/>experimental support. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements clearly demonstrate that the <lb/>pseudogap evolves into the superconducting gap at low temperatures [37]. Moreover, ARPES data indicate <lb/>that the pseudo-and the superconducting gap both have d-wave symmetry [4]. Our experimental observation <lb/>of a close relation between the pseudogap and the superconducting fluctuations (= precursor pairs) strongly <lb/>favor these models as well. Altshuler et al. [38] questioned the interpretation of the pseudogap as the <lb/>superconducting gap because a large fluctuation diamagnetism has not been observed between T c and T * . <lb/>
            Emery et al. [34] stated however that the absence of dramatic diamagnetic effects is expected if the <lb/>superconducting fluctuations are one-dimensional, and if the Josephson coupling between stripes is small. In <lb/>this case, an applied magnetic field does not cause any significant orbital motion until full phase coherence <lb/>develops, close to T c . T o our knowledge, we are not aware of other publications, which unveiled the one-<lb/>dimensional character of the superconducting fluctuations experimentally (Figure 9). We found the one-<lb/>dimensional nature of the transport of precursor pairs thanks to the investigation of the magnetoresistivity <lb/>very close to the insulator-superconductor transition. <lb/>T he magnetoresistivity data for La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 , presented in Figure 5, do show neither clearly <lb/>marked second critical fields H c2 (T) nor saturation at high fields. Fluctuating Cooper pairs seem to exist up <lb/>to very high fields, most probably above the field range accessible by our pulsed field setup. Following the <lb/>ideas outlined in [34, 37], T * is the mean-field critical temperature of the superconductor rather than T c . <lb/>When T * is used to obtain the paramagnetic limiting field for sample La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 (T * ≈ 400 K, <lb/>T c = 17.5 K) instead of T c , a value of µ o H p ≈ 700 T is obtained, illustrating that a field of 50 T is indeed not <lb/>high enough to destroy completely the preformed pairs. T he ARPES research of Loeser et al. on the <lb/>pseudogap in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ [4] revealed a binding energy of 75 meV in the precursor pairs. T hus a <lb/>magnetic field of about 130 T (µ o µ B H = k B T) would be needed to destroy them completely. If the idea of <lb/>precursor pairs is correct, the temperature seems to be a much more critical parameter for the existence of the <lb/>pairs than a magnetic field up to 50 T . T he &apos;resistive upper critical field&apos;, as defined by a line construction, is <lb/>certainly a questionable concept with respect to the underdoped high-T c compounds. It is possible that the <lb/>magnetoresistivity data of the samples, which manifest a pseudogap, just reflect the behavior of the precursor <lb/>pairs in a magnetic field, maybe even the localization of the pairs in a magnetic field. <lb/>Superconductivity in metals is the result of two distinct quantum phenomena, pairing and long-rang <lb/>phase coherence. T he influence of the stripes on superconductivity is therefore two-fold. First of all, the <lb/>one-dimensional character of the charge transport favors pair formation as follows from the similarities <lb/>between the pseudogap in high-T c superconductors and the spin-gap in ladder cuprates and from <lb/>experiments that demonstrate a connection between the superconducting-and the pseudogap. On the other <lb/>hand, the low dimensionality hinders the long-range phase coherence needed to establish bulk <lb/>superconductivity. It is a well-known fact that long-range phase coherence is impossible in a purely one-<lb/>dimensional system. T his is in agreement with the fact that (La,Sr,Ca) 14 Cu 24 O 41 , the only known <lb/>superconducting ladder compound, becomes superconducting under high pressure when the interactions <lb/>between the ladders are enhanced. <lb/>Like already stated before, the broadening of the superconducting transitions in underdoped cuprates, both in <lb/>field and temperature, is most probably due to sample inhomogeneities. However, the inhomogeneities do not <lb/>reflect a bad sample quality but rather an intrinsic property, related to a low charge carrier concentration and the <lb/>presence of stripes. <lb/>T he superconducting transitions for overdoped and underdoped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 epitaxial thin films, showing <lb/>up in our transport measurements in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T , have a completely different nature. <lb/>While the transition in underdoped samples is smeared out over more than 40 T , the overdoped samples <lb/>
            reveal well-defined second critical fields H c2 , where bulk superconductivity is suppressed. In these <lb/>overdoped samples, we found an upward curvature of H c2 (T) at low temperatures, in strong contrast with the <lb/>WHH model [39, 40], which predicts a saturation of the second critical field in this temperature range. A <lb/>similar anomalous behavior of H c2 with respect to the temperature has been reported in the literature for <lb/>several high-T c systems [41, 42, 29]. <lb/>Conclusion: Gerneric phase diagram including fluctuation area <lb/>T he pulsed field transport measurements at temperatures T &gt; T c , revealed a sudden appearance of a <lb/>large positive in-plane magneto-resistivity in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 close to the insulator-superconductor transition at <lb/>x = 0.055. T his evolution suggests that the effect can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. T he <lb/>fluctuations appear at temperatures, which exceed T c by several times. It is therefore reasonable to speak <lb/>about precursory pairing far above T c . By presenting the magnetoresistivity data in the form of classical <lb/>Kohler-plots, we found that the superconducting fluctuations are very pronounced in underdoped samples. <lb/>At the same time, the normal-state contribution to the magnetoresistivity dominates in overdoped samples. <lb/>T he region, where we observed superconducting fluctuations, is schematically shown in the phase diagram <lb/>of Figure 10 by the shaded area. In order to evaluate this region exactly, an adequate theory is needed, which <lb/>allows to separate fluctuations and normal-state contributions to conductivity. Unfortunately, such theory is <lb/>lacking at the moment. It is however clear from our data that there is a close link between the presence of <lb/>strong superconducting fluctuations and the pseudogap phase. Since fluctuations are expected to become <lb/>more pronounced in systems with a reduced dimensionality, this observation is in excellent agreement with <lb/>the idea that the pseudogap phase is characterized by 1D charge transport [23]. T he excess conductivity of <lb/>the La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 (T c = 2.4 K) and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 (T c = 17.5 K) sample at 50 T indeed shows a simple <lb/>power-law behavior with respect to the temperature. T he experimentally found power 1.54 is close to 3/2, <lb/>which is characteristic for one-dimensional fluctuations, according to the basic theory of paraconductivity, <lb/>proposed by Aslamasov and Larkin [43]. Hence, our findings strongly favor stripe models [30-36] and are <lb/>consistent with the idea of a precursory behavior towards superconductivity far above T c . <lb/></body>

The <lb/>dimensions of the electronic transport in region I and II, are labelled in the Figure. A shaded area is added, <lb/>which schematically shows the region, where we observed superconducting fluctuations.<lb/>
