			<body>Introduction <lb/>Law-related education is &quot;education to equip nonlawyers with knowledge and skills <lb/>pertaining to the law, the legal process and the legal system, and the fundamental <lb/>principles and values on which these are based.&quot; 2 Law-related education is a branch of <lb/>civics education although there is overlap between law-related topics and civics topics <lb/>because both areas include the study of the Bill of Rights, the study of the function of <lb/>government institutions, and the study of one&apos;s rights with respect to voting, jury duty, <lb/>etc. Often, the terms law-related education and civics education are used <lb/>interchangeably. However, there is a trend for law-related education to be associated <lb/>with violence prevention. In this article, I provide an overview of the origin of law-related <lb/>education, a discussion of a law-related education program that I developed for K-12 3 <lb/>students, my reflections on implementing the program, key resources that I found during <lb/></body>

Through the work of Minna <lb/>Post Peyser, the National Assembly on Teaching the Principles of the Bill of Rights <lb/>became affiliated with Columbia University and Teachers College. 7 <lb/>The 1970s were a particularly innovative time for law-related education. 8 In 1972, law <lb/>students founded the Street Law program to teach high school students practical legal <lb/>principles at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC. 9 In 1975, West <lb/></body>

I began <lb/>saving news articles that dealt with issues of civics education. 14 Later, as part of my course <lb/>work in the Master of Science in Library Science degree program at the University of <lb/>North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I designed and completed a service-learning project called <lb/></body>

My service-learning <lb/>project included teaching ninth and twelfth graders their rights and responsibilities and <lb/>allowing time for questions and discussion. Knowing that not all students would speak <lb/>up during the class discussion, I used exit tickets (end-of-class surveys in which students <lb/>may write responses to questions I have asked them or write down questions to ask me) <lb/>to see how the students were apprehending the information presented. For the session <lb/>entitled &quot;How to Be Safe on Social Media,&quot; I discussed a student who had many Facebook <lb/>friends. The student told her Facebook friends about her father&apos;s confidential settlement <lb/>with his employer. 16 At the end of the lesson, students wrote responses on exit tickets <lb/>such as &quot;Everything you post is linked to some form of personal information,&quot; and &quot;I will <lb/>change my Facebook privacy settings.&quot; For the lesson, &quot;Never Leave Your Luggage <lb/>Alone at the Airport,&quot; I discussed Indonesia&apos;s death penalty for smuggling drugs, the <lb/>Indonesian government&apos;s sentencing to death of people caught drug smuggling, 17 and <lb/>how one should be vigilant regarding one&apos;s luggage at the airport. One student wrote in <lb/>an exit ticket, &quot;I learned how to be more cautious with my luggage.&quot; The students were <lb/></body>

		<body>interested in the topics presented and they were learning about their rights and <lb/>responsibilities. <lb/>Reflections <lb/>I have had opportunities to reflect on the law-related education program that I designed <lb/>and implemented for high schoolers. The first opportunity came in 2015 when I spoke at <lb/>the North Carolina School Library Media Association (NCSLMA) 2015 Conference and <lb/>discussed the Program&apos;s content. 18 In spring 2016, I reflected on the Program when I <lb/>created a version of the program for middle school students. Another opportunity to <lb/>reflect came when I wrote Five Key Points for Developing an Informative &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; <lb/>Seminar which was published in the fall 2016 issue of the American Bar Association <lb/>Young Lawyers Division Public Education Committee Newsletter. 19 <lb/>These opportunities to reflect have led me to the following conclusions about law-related <lb/>education programs: <lb/>1. Providing attendees with information they can review later, even if the <lb/>information is only a link to a website is key. In 2015, I provided the link to my <lb/>slides for Practical Life Lessons to the students. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. Providing content that fits the format of the program and the interests of the <lb/>attendees is important. I have led law-related education programs in 20-minute <lb/>and one-hour timeframes. The time-allotted affects the breadth and depth of what <lb/>I am able to cover. In 20 minutes, I am able to introduce a topic and save the <lb/>remaining ten minutes for discussion. In one hour, I am able to provide more <lb/>details about the topic and lead a lengthier group discussion. The topics I selected <lb/>for the initial iteration were based on students&apos; interests and experience. I selected <lb/>&quot;How to be Safe on Social Media&quot; because many students have social media <lb/>accounts. I selected &quot;Never Leave Your Luggage Alone at the Airport&quot; because the <lb/>students attending the program were at a high school that sponsored travel <lb/>programs. <lb/>Key Resources <lb/>In preparing for the law-related education programs that I implemented in spring 2015 <lb/>and 2016, I came across many resources, however six stand out: <lb/>โข The original Street Law textbook entitled Street Law: A Course in Practical <lb/>Law, <lb/>โข Breaking Rank by Norm Stamper, <lb/>โข The Privilege of Silence by Steven M. Salky, <lb/>โข Once Upon a Crime by Wanda Cassidy and Ruth Yates, <lb/></body>

			<body>โข Law-Related Education as a Delinquency Prevention Strategy: A Three-Year <lb/>Evaluation of the Impact of LRE on Students, by Grant Johnson and Robert <lb/>Hunter, and <lb/>โข The Law-Related Education Act of 1978. <lb/>The original Street Law textbook was published by West Publishing Company in 1975 20 <lb/>and is the work of former and current law students of Georgetown University Law Center <lb/>as well as attorneys. It covers practical topics in the field of law such as consumer law, <lb/>housing law, and criminal law. The book has an outline format and hypothetical <lb/>problems for class discussion. While I was lesson planning, the book served as a reminder <lb/>that even from the early days of law-related education programs, law-related education <lb/>was meant to be practical and applied to everyday life. Breaking Rank by Norm Stamper 21 <lb/>and The Privilege of Silence by Steven M. Salky 22 provided useful information such as what <lb/>happens when average citizens encounter the police and the origin of the Miranda <lb/>Warnings as I was planning the Right to Remain Silent activity 23 in 2015. Wanda Cassidy <lb/>and Ruth Yates&apos; book Once Upon a Crime 24 was notable because it supports the notion that <lb/></body>

		<body>even younger youth can be introduced to concepts of rights and responsibilities. In Once <lb/>Upon a Crime, Cassidy and Yates provide guidelines and plans for implementing mock <lb/>trials in Kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms. <lb/>Grant Johnson and Robert Hunter&apos;s report entitled Law-Related Education as a Delinquency <lb/>Prevention Strategy: A Three-Year Evaluation of the Impact of LRE on Students prompted me <lb/>to think about the impact of law-related education on students beyond the classroom. <lb/>The report is particularly useful for its enumeration and explanation of features necessary <lb/>for an effective law-related education program. These recommendations include &quot;that <lb/>the system be depicted neither as infallible nor as a nightmare.&quot; 25 The discussion of <lb/>negative realities of the legal system and how people can work within the legal system to <lb/>advocate for their rights needs to be balanced. From the beginning, law-related education <lb/>programs have embraced controversial topics, 26 however, law-related education was not <lb/>intended to be a depressing session where people share grievances or engage in never-<lb/>ending arguments. In the law-related education program that I led in 2015, I spoke of <lb/>practices students could implement in their daily lives such as not putting one&apos;s or one&apos;s <lb/>parents&apos; daily schedule information on social media (and why). <lb/></body>

			<body>The Law-Related Education Act of 1978 was part of a larger Education Amendments Act, <lb/>however, sections 346, 347, and 348 dealt specifically with law-related education. In <lb/>Section 346, Congress stated that it had found that there was a &quot;widespread lack of <lb/>understanding of how our system of law and legal institutions work.&quot; Furthermore, <lb/>&quot;such an understanding is essential&quot; for youth to become knowledgeable and responsible <lb/>citizens and &quot;there is an urgent need for Federal involvement&quot; to develop law-related <lb/>education programs. 27 Section 347 included the definition of law-related education that I <lb/>stated above and empowered a Commissioner to carry out a program of grants so that <lb/>local actors could implement law-related education programs at the local level. These <lb/>programs would be for youth and adults, in community organizations, as well as schools <lb/>and universities. 28 Section 348 authorized $15 million to implement the provisions of the <lb/>Act. 29 Accounting for inflation, the amount would be approximately $62 million in 2021. 30 <lb/>The law was repealed in 1982. 31 <lb/></body>

			<body>State Laws that Address K-12 Law-Related Education Focus on Violence Prevention <lb/>State statutes that address law-related education programs in the K-12 context focus on <lb/>violence prevention as the goal and not necessarily the goal of educating students to learn <lb/>the day-to-day rights and responsibilities of citizens. In Alabama, law-related education <lb/>is &quot;[e]ducation which provides children and youth with the knowledge and skills <lb/>pertaining to the law, the legal process, school safety, and citizenship responsibilities to <lb/>promote law-abiding behavior with the purpose to prevent children and youth from <lb/>engaging in delinquency or violence and enable them to become productive citizens.&quot; 32 <lb/>In Arizona, schools may apply for funding to offset the costs of placing school resource <lb/>officers, juvenile probation officers, school counselors and school social workers at the <lb/>school. 33 Schools that apply for the school safety program must have &quot;[a] plan for <lb/>implementing a law-related education program or a plan that demonstrates the existence <lb/>of a law-related education program as a school safety prevention strategy.&quot; 34 In addition, <lb/>the governing board of schools may &quot;[e] nter into an intergovernmental agreement with <lb/>a presiding judge of the juvenile court to implement a law-related education program as <lb/>defined in section 15-154.&quot; 35 The Colorado Revised Statutes mention &quot;rights and <lb/></body>

			<body>was to prompt students to think about why different courts have different rationales <lb/>when making decisions about similar sets of facts. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>From the inception of law-related education, organizers of law-related education <lb/>programs have endeavored to make the programs practical by covering topics that the <lb/>students would need to know in daily life. Although the federal Law-Related Education <lb/>Act was repealed in 1982, states continue to address K-12 civics education in their <lb/>statutes. Recently, state legislatures that have used the term &quot;law-related education&quot; in <lb/>the K-12 context have focused on law-related education for violence prevention and <lb/>within the context of youth courts. Law-related education is about knowing one&apos;s rights <lb/>and responsibilities as a citizen even in situations where one has not been accused of <lb/>breaking the law and there needs to be a concerted effort to bring the essence of law-<lb/>related education within the purview of state legislatures. Additional programs aimed <lb/>toward teenagers that are organized outside the K-12 school context such as &quot;Know Your <lb/>Rights Workshops&quot; and other programs, for example the Cornell Law Institute for High <lb/>School Students, are also valuable in educating youth regarding civics and law-related <lb/>education. Law-related education is more than violence prevention. It is a branch of civics <lb/>that is a necessary part of K-12 education. </body>
