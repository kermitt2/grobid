<body>never before has the formulation of the european Union&apos;s social and economic de-<lb/>velopment objectives and public policies been so strongly and directly related to <lb/>the protection of the climate. 2 this phenomenon is well illustrated by the concept <lb/>of a regenerative economy, which gives the planet more than it takes from it. 3 An <lb/>inseparable feature of this concept is the model of regenerative growth (qualita-<lb/>tive growth), according to which a healthy environment and efficient ecosystems <lb/>provide safe operational space for the development of the economy. 4 a holistic <lb/>view of economic growth that takes into account environmental and social aspects <lb/>is presented by the concept of sustainable development, 5 which is being imple-<lb/>mented by the member states of the Un. 6 <lb/>adopted in december 2019, the commission&apos;s european green deal (egd) 7 <lb/>is a leading economic development strategy document which provides for the <lb/>green remodelling of the eU economy to become the world&apos;s first climate-neutral <lb/>area within three decades. it can easily be assumed that, given such ambitious <lb/>objectives, all sectors of the economy, without exception, are facing major recon-<lb/>struction, but it is precisely the energy sector that is playing a key role in reduc-<lb/>ing emissions. changing the energy system is therefore a sine qua non condition <lb/>for the achievement of the ambitious objectives of the european green deal. it <lb/>should be pointed out that, in comparison with the economies of all the Member <lb/>states, the greatest changes can be expected in the energy sector in Poland, where, <lb/>despite the huge increase in energy from renewable sources in recent years, almost <lb/>70% of electricity is still generated by burning bituminous coal and lignite. 8 <lb/></body>

<body>policy with particular reference to its legal conditions. it will present the direc-<lb/>tions of the changes in the eU legal regulations in recent decades in order. central <lb/>to this is an attempt to answer the question of whether the european Union&apos;s am-<lb/>bitious goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as proclaimed in the european <lb/>green deal, should be viewed in terms of a continuation of the eU&apos;s earlier energy <lb/>policy, or perhaps more in terms of a kind of &quot;revolution&quot;, imposing systemic <lb/>changes in the energy sector of the Member states. <lb/>1. the specificity of the energy market <lb/>the specificity of the energy sector should be borne in mind when analysing the <lb/>evolution of the legal basis, as it is not only very strongly connected with economic de-<lb/>velopment, but also determines environmental and climate protection. therefore, the <lb/>presentation of the evolution of the sectoral policy and the relevant legal regula-<lb/>tions should reflect the change in eU (community) preferences in this respect. in <lb/>the early days of the european communities, the priority area of regulation was <lb/>energy at the expense of the environment, to recall that two of the three treaties con-<lb/>stituting the communities were treaties devoted to the rules on the use of primary <lb/>energy resources, namely coal (the european coal and steel community) 9 and the <lb/>atom (the treaty establishing the european atomic energy community). 10 <lb/>during the initial phase of development, i.e. on the wave of the rapid growth <lb/>of industrial production, the application of these treaties was limited to the coordi-<lb/>nation of activities in the coal and nuclear energy sectors. it should be emphasized <lb/>that the energy sector was traditionally -and still is today -considered to be of <lb/>strategic importance to the development of national economies. as a result, en-<lb/>ergy is referred to as a driver of economic growth of countries 11 and is perceived <lb/>solely in economic terms. as the community&apos;s energy policy at the time was <lb/>restricted to the limited matter provided for in the treaties, it was the Member <lb/>states themselves which largely laid down the relevant sectoral regulations, which <lb/>reinforced the position of the monopolistic energy companies in the individual <lb/>states revealing the differences in interests between the states. 12 <lb/></body>

<body>the increasing dependence of the european economies on imports of oil <lb/>from Middle eastern countries followed by the oil crisis in the early 1970s <lb/>changed this situation. it was then that the issue of energy security, which is still <lb/>so topical today and determines the subject matter of the public discussion, en-<lb/>tered public awareness. a decision was then made to adopt a series of directives <lb/>and council recommendations to achieve energy security, including through the <lb/>introduction of the obligation to build up minimum stocks of fuel or to reduce <lb/>the use of oil and natural gas products at power plants. 13 However, even in the <lb/>face of the need for closer cooperation, discussions on the need to coordinate <lb/>the external energy policies of the Member states (not only) then encountered <lb/>general reluctance. 14 <lb/>the establishment of the european common Market in the late 1980s, which <lb/>is an &quot;area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, per-<lb/>sons, services and capital is ensured&quot;, under the single european act of 1986 (this <lb/>is now article 26 tFeU) introduced a new quality into europe&apos;s energy policy. <lb/>the single european act not only created the treaty basis for building an internal <lb/>energy market, but also strengthened political cooperation among the community <lb/>countries. consequently, a number of new regulations were issued under the so-<lb/>called First and second Packages regarding the liberalization of the energy mar-<lb/>kets, as a result of which the energy market that had been monopolized to date was <lb/>gradually subjected to free market mechanisms. one of the liberalization mecha-<lb/>nisms was the introduction of the tPa (third party access) principle, namely third <lb/>party access to transmission and distribution networks for any interested entities, <lb/>as well as the principle of unbundling, namely the separation of network activities <lb/>from other activities on the energy market. 15 <lb/>2. the importance of primary law <lb/>and international law <lb/>the increase in the significance of energy is best illustrated by the adoption <lb/>of the treaty of Lisbon in 2007, which introduced a separate title XXi -energy <lb/></body>

<body>-into the treaty on the Functioning of the european Union (tFeU) 16 (article <lb/>194 tFeU). 17 this gave the subject matter in question a high position among the <lb/>treaty provisions. the first paragraph of that article specifies the four objectives of <lb/>the Union&apos;s energy policy, which are: <lb/>(a) ensure the functioning of the energy market; (b) ensure security of energy supply in the <lb/>Union; (c) promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable <lb/>forms of energy; and (d) promote the interconnection of energy networks. <lb/>importantly, the assurance of the functioning of the energy market was stated <lb/>in first place, which was fully reflected in the legislation at that time targeted at <lb/>further opening up the energy market (the so-called third Package), especially the <lb/>development of competition, implemented, among other things, through the prin-<lb/>ciple of the free choice of energy and gas supplier and the protection of consumers, <lb/>especially the so-called &quot;most vulnerable customers&quot;. 18 and although experts claim <lb/>the process of forming the internal energy market has ended, it should be stated that <lb/>a competitive energy market is a necessary prerequisite for the transformation of the <lb/>monopolized energy market into a distributed and prosumer system. 19 <lb/>an important reinforcement of the eU&apos;s competence in energy was the intro-<lb/>duction of certain areas of energy policy into the scope of shared competence in <lb/>article 194 tFeU, which, in turn, opened the path for the creation of a common <lb/>energy policy. even so, each Member state retained the right &quot;to determine the <lb/>conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy <lb/>sources and the general structure of its energy supply&quot; (article 194(2)). <lb/>simultaneously, taking into account the systemic interpretation of the treaty, <lb/>it should be pointed out that article 194 tFeU is immediately preceded by the title <lb/>Environment (articles 191-193 tFeU), which suggests that there is a need to con-<lb/>nect these two issues. this is also confirmed by the wording of article 11 tFeU, <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>16 see the treaty amending the treaty on european Union and the treaty establishing the <lb/>european community, signed at Lisbon on 13 december 2007 (oJ eU c no. 306, p. 1). <lb/>17 it should be pointed out that, in terms of energy policy, primary law contains a number <lb/>of other specific provisions, which primarily include article 122 tFeU (security of supply), arti-<lb/>cles 170-172 tFeU (energy networks), article 114 tFeU (internal electricity market) and articles <lb/>216-218 tFeU (external energy policy). <lb/>18 the third package was targeted at the further integration of the national energy systems and <lb/>the development of competition. in particular, directive 2009/72/ec introduced the principle of <lb/>ownership unbundling, namely the unbundling of ownership of energy and natural gas transmission <lb/>activities from other energy activities, as well as the establishment of the acer agency, namely <lb/>the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators, under regulation 713/2009 for coordinating <lb/>regulatory activities in the Member states. see directive 2009/72/ec of the european Parliament <lb/>and of the council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity <lb/>and repealing directive 2003/54/ec; regulation (ec) no 713/2009 of the european Parliament and <lb/>of the council of 13 July 2009 establishing an agency for the cooperation of energy regulators. <lb/>19 t.

<body>which provides that: &quot;environmental protection requirements must be integrated <lb/>into the definition and implementation of the Union&apos;s policies and activities, in <lb/>particular with a view to promoting sustainable development&quot;. it should therefore <lb/>be concluded that the adoption of the treaty of Lisbon opens a new stage of the <lb/>eU energy policy, featuring not only the further liberalization of the energy mar-<lb/>ket, but primarily the adoption of the principle of climate and environmental pro-<lb/>tection in accordance with the guidelines on sustainable development developed <lb/>by the Un institutions. consequently, there was a need to revise the objectives of <lb/>the energy policy to date. <lb/>the provisions of international law treaties, especially the 1992 United na-<lb/>tions Framework convention on climate change 20 and the 1997 kyoto Protocol 21 <lb/>on combating global warming, gave an overwhelming impetus for redefining pub-<lb/>lic policies and introducing new energy regulations. the appropriate legislative <lb/>process was initiated in 2007 in the communication from the commission, An <lb/>Energy Policy for Europe, 22 which was referred to as the climate and energy <lb/>Package because of the combined treatment of environmental and energy issues. <lb/>this package is referred to as the &quot;3x20&quot; or &quot;20-20-20&quot; package, because it sets <lb/>three key targets to be achieved by 2020. the first target is a 20% reduction in <lb/>greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1990 levels. 23 the second target is the <lb/>promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, specifically to achieve <lb/>a 20% share of energy from res in total gross energy consumption. 24 the third <lb/>target applies to energy efficiency, in particular the obligation to increase energy <lb/>efficiency by 20%. 25 the climate and energy package exemplifies the link be-<lb/></body>

<body>tween eU policies and global policies. the most notable is the introduction of the <lb/>eU emissions trading scheme (eU ets) at that time, the objective of which was <lb/>to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by energy-intensive industries, <lb/>energy producers, airlines and road and maritime transport. 26 <lb/>3. the energy union <lb/>the next stage in the development of the energy policy in the eU was initiat-<lb/>ed by the 2015 commission communication announcing the creation of an energy <lb/>union 27 in order to connect energy and climate protection even more strongly. the <lb/>guiding idea behind the establishment of the energy union was the desire to ensure <lb/>that all europeans (specifically businesses and households) have access to safe, <lb/>sustainable and affordable energy. Furthermore, at the end of 2015, the interna-<lb/>tional community adopted the new climate commitments contained in the Paris <lb/>agreement. 28 this is an international agreement ratified by both the eU 29 and all <lb/>its Member states, 30 which contains an action plan for reducing global warming. <lb/>the most important element of the agreement is the long-term goal of the signa-<lb/>tory countries involving the stoppage of the increase in the average global tem-<lb/>perature at a level which is well below 2°c compared to the pre-industrial levels <lb/>and to strive for it to be no more than 1.5°c. therefore, the instruments created <lb/>within the framework of the energy Union have come to be seen as a mechanism <lb/>for achieving these very ambitious climate goals. 31 <lb/>the commission presented a package of eight legislative proposals on <lb/>30 november 2016 in the form of a communication entitled &quot;clean energy for <lb/>all europeans&quot;, 32 which had the objective of aligning eU legislation to the needs <lb/></body>

<body>of implementing the 2015 energy Union. a number of acts of law regulating <lb/>such important issues as the management of the energy union, the specification <lb/>of the structure of the electricity market, energy efficiency, renewable energy and <lb/>the functioning of the regulatory body, namely the agency for the cooperation of <lb/>energy regulators, were adopted at the turn of 2016/2017 as a result (hence their <lb/>name: the &quot;Winter Package&quot;). these include directive 2018/2001 on the promo-<lb/>tion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the so-called red ii directive), <lb/>the new energy efficiency directive (2018/2002/eU), the amended directive <lb/>2018/844 on the energy performance of buildings, which introduced long-term <lb/>renovation strategies, and regulation 2017/1369 setting a framework for energy <lb/>labelling. <lb/>the key changes introduced by the &quot;clean energy for all europeans&quot; pack-<lb/>age involve the strengthening of the eU&apos;s influence on national climate and en-<lb/>ergy policy, the acceleration of the speed of investment in res and the reduction <lb/>of the ability to support low-carbon energy. For the purposes of these consider-<lb/>ations, it should be stated that the last element of this legislative package, namely <lb/>regulation 2018/1999 on the governance of the energy Union 33 that constituted <lb/>the five dimensions of the energy union, which are closely interlinked and mutu-<lb/>ally reinforcing, has created the greatest impact on the shape of energy policy. ac-<lb/>cording to article 1(2), these include energy security, the internal energy market, <lb/>energy efficiency, decarbonization and research, innovation and competitiveness. <lb/>it should be pointed out that these dimensions coincide with the treaty&apos;s energy <lb/>policy objectives, as formulated in article 194(1) tFeU, but there is a change of <lb/>emphasis in this case, as energy security is positioned in first place. this regula-<lb/>tion refers to the Member states and the european Union preparing long-term <lb/>strategies as a &quot;governance mechanism&quot;, including integrated national energy and <lb/>climate plans every ten years, starting from the period 2021-2030 (article 3). <lb/>simultaneously, the obligation to present a progress report every two years and <lb/>to prepare coherent long-term national strategies to achieve the objectives of the <lb/>Paris agreement was laid down. it is worth noting that article 11 of the regula-<lb/>tion provides for the need to organize a multilevel climate and energy dialogue, <lb/>in which local authorities are able to actively engage, alongside civil society or-<lb/>ganizations, businesses, investors and other stakeholders. it should therefore be <lb/>stated that local and regional authorities must necessarily actively participate in <lb/>the process of shaping individual energy and climate policy scenarios, as well as <lb/>integrated national energy and climate plans in the specific area. <lb/></body>

<body>4. european green deal <lb/>the commission&apos;s european green deal communication adopted in decem-<lb/>ber 2019 proclaims an ambitious goal of eU climate neutrality by 2050, while its <lb/>achievement implies not only a move away from fossil fuels, but also the need to <lb/>transform practically all other sectors of the economy that have so far not been <lb/>directly associated with the decarbonization process, such as agriculture, transport <lb/>and construction. the holistic approach appears in the nature of the commission&apos;s <lb/>communication, because the european green deal is a holistic eU development <lb/>strategy (a so-called cross-sectoral strategy), setting long-term goals in a number <lb/>of interrelated areas. <lb/>as the european green deal communication is not legally binding, the need <lb/>arose to legally sanction the goal of climate neutrality. a regulation named the eu-<lb/>ropean climate Law was adopted in 2021. 34 this is a key element and the starting <lb/>point for future eU legislation and law-making for pursuing all the assumptions <lb/>of the european green deal. the formulation of this act refers to a number of <lb/>eU regulations and policies and is not limited exclusively to energy matters. it is <lb/>sometimes referred to as the &quot;climate treaty&quot; because, although it was issued in <lb/>the form of a regulation, it is a secondary regulation and has an unprecedented sig-<lb/>nificance and scope. in a nutshell, the climate Law is a comprehensive legal tool <lb/>for economically transforming the eU to bring about a zero-carbon economy. 35 <lb/>the adoption of the european climate Law constitutes the normative sanc-<lb/>tioning of the goal of climate neutrality, however, a subsequent need arose to <lb/>redefine the eU&apos;s energy policy to date by reviewing all existing legislation. con-<lb/>sequently, another, fifth legislative package named &quot;Fit for 55&quot; was developed, <lb/>which was promulgated in the commission communication of 2021 36 and ad-<lb/>opted by the council on 25 april 2023 as the final stage of the legislative proce-<lb/>dure. it was adopted in the light of fierce opposition from Poland, although this <lb/>opposition was not taken into account because of the applicability of the ordinary <lb/>legislative procedure for shared competences, to which the matter regulated by <lb/>the package belongs (see: article 194 tFeU, as already discussed). in general <lb/>terms, the legislation contained in &quot;Fit for 55&quot; is targeted at reducing greenhouse <lb/>gas emissions in the main sectors of the economy and supporting citizens and <lb/>micro-enterprises, as well as sectors at risk of carbon leakage. the core objective <lb/></body>

<body>is to reduce the eU&apos;s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 com-<lb/>pared to the levels from 1990 and to achieve climate neutrality in the eU by 2050. <lb/>the regulations especially address renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, <lb/>energy taxation, air and maritime transport, as well as buildings. the package <lb/>consists of a reform of the ets directive; the amendment of the regulation on <lb/>the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from mari-<lb/>time transport; a revision of the ets directive applying to the aviation sector; the <lb/>regulation establishing a social climate Fund; and the regulation establishing <lb/>a carbon border adjustment mechanism (cBaM regulation). 37 Furthermore, the <lb/>package includes a review of all applicable eU acts on climate and energy, includ-<lb/>ing the renewable energy directive, the energy efficiency directive, the energy <lb/>taxation directive and the energy Performance of Buildings directive. 38 <lb/>5. conclusions <lb/>as for the question posed at the outset of whether the achievement of the <lb/>objectives of the european green deal marks a turning point and a kind of revo-<lb/>lution in the energy policy to date or is rather a continuation of the reforms un-<lb/>dertaken earlier with their adaptation to the new climate objectives, it should be <lb/>stated that the answer should be based on an analysis of the acts of law adopted <lb/>in the current fifth package. the main observation is that there is a continuation, <lb/>but simultaneously a radical deepening and acceleration of the reforms of the <lb/>energy sector to date. continuation means that the five main objectives of the en-<lb/>ergy union established in 2015 are still in place and, in turn, the union would not <lb/>have been possible without the previous three liberalization packages creating and <lb/>strengthening the internal energy market. the deepening and broadening of the re-<lb/>forms to date means that the objective of climate neutrality has been incorporated <lb/>into all areas of the energy union, because, for instance, the principles of operation <lb/>and the structure of the energy market change when account is taken of the eU <lb/>legislator&apos;s intensive efforts to promote renewables and energy efficiency, as well <lb/>as to introduce new mechanisms of energy security. the new crisis response in-<lb/>struments provided for in the rePowereU Plan 39 , for example, which constitutes <lb/>a response to the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market as a result <lb/></body>

<body>of russia&apos;s attack on Ukraine and in order to end the eU&apos;s dependence on russian <lb/>fossil fuels, serve this purpose. <lb/>Furthermore, it should be stated in conclusion that tracking the evolution of <lb/>eU energy policy reveals the ambivalent nature of the energy sector. in traditional <lb/>terms, the energy sector is viewed as an engine for the economic development of <lb/>countries, which was most fully reflected in the reasons for establishing the euro-<lb/>pean coal and steel community in 1952 as a community of economic interests to <lb/>secure access to strategic energy sources, namely coal and nuclear fuel. However, <lb/>today, energy based on high-carbon sources is a factor which hinders the socio-<lb/>economic development of a country, which can be fully applied to the current <lb/>situation in Poland. therefore, this is not so much an evolution in the perception <lb/>of the significance of the energy sector, as it is still key to modern economies, <lb/>but the setting of the climate neutrality objective has caused a systemic change in <lb/>the valuation of energy sources according to the criterion of emissivity, and it is <lb/>precisely an energy mix based on low-carbon sources that constitutes the basis of <lb/>competitive advantage. <lb/>Meanwhile, the evolution of the energy policy primarily presents an incred-<lb/>ible increase in the visibility of the timeless values on which the european Union is <lb/>based. While the reforms of the first three liberalization packages targeted at creat-<lb/>ing, administering and modernizing the single market prioritize economic values, <lb/>the adoption of the treaty of Lisbon in 2007 and the ratification of the respective <lb/>Un conventions and agreements has seen an exponential increase in the significance <lb/>of climate protection and, with it, such fundamental values as the common good, <lb/>health and human life, freedom, justice and intergenerational solidarity. <lb/></body>
