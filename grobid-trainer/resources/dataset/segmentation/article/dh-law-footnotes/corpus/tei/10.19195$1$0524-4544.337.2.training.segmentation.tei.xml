    <body>energy transition is defined by various factors, the aggregation of which justifies <lb/>distinguishing at least five categories of transformation drivers, including (1) legal <lb/>drivers, (2) organizational drivers, (3) social drivers, (4) technological drivers and <lb/>(5) commercial drivers. these drivers are interconnected and reinforce each other, <lb/>thereby increasing the synergistic effect of energy transformation. Later in the <lb/>article -in accordance with its subject matter -the attention will be focused on <lb/>the legal and organizational drivers determining the quality of changes in the area <lb/>of energy transition, or rather, on a specific aspect of these two categories of driv-<lb/>ers, namely networking. the objective of the paper is to present the two funda-<lb/>mental networking mechanisms of energy transition, which, in the Polish legal <lb/>order, are energy clusters and energy cooperatives, and to compare the two mech-<lb/>anisms with each other. the paper uses the method of content analysis of legal <lb/>regulations (eU and national) and specialised literature on the subject. the article <lb/>is interdisciplinary in nature, not limiting itself to an analysis of legal regulations <lb/>but referring to findings from other scientific disciplines. since energy clusters <lb/>and energy cooperatives represent a business model for local energy generation and <lb/>balancing, it is reasonable to refer to the literature on the subject especially in the <lb/>area of management science, sociology. restricting oneself to an analysis of legal <lb/>regulations makes it impossible to explain the mechanism of operation of these <lb/>two mechanisms of local energy production from res. <lb/></body>

    <body>be analysed on two intertwining planes. the first is the axiological plane, which <lb/>is determined by the values, intentions, principles and rules of operation and <lb/>management of activities constituting the area of energy transformation, which <lb/>are present in the eU regulations and reflected in national law. one of the val-<lb/>ues attributed with significance in the transition processes is cooperation, which <lb/>is simultaneously considered to be an important level in energy transformation. <lb/>article 22 of the directive of the european Parliament and of the council (eU) of <lb/>11 december 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, <lb/>colloquially referred to as the red ii directive, 3 exposes the significance of the <lb/>establishment and operation of energy communities, also referred to here as en-<lb/>ergy collectives, 4 the logic of operation of which is based precisely on the collabo-<lb/>ration of entities of various provenance. an energy community is a legal entity in <lb/>which membership is based on the principles of voluntariness, cooperation and <lb/>openness. 5 the activity of energy communities which assumes the form of coop-<lb/>eration has both a conceptual dimension -the theoretical structure of a model of <lb/>energy management -and an adaptive dimension -the implementation of model-<lb/>specific solutions. By taking into account the dual nature of the activity of energy <lb/>collectives, each of them can be seen to be of a unique nature and creates a unique <lb/>ecosystem which is appropriate to itself. simultaneously, within the framework <lb/>of this activity, the red ii directive requires Member states to provide energy <lb/>communities with the right to: (1) generate, (2) consume, (3) store and (4) sell <lb/>renewable energy. Furthermore, the provisions of the directive require Member <lb/>states to provide tools to energy collectives or entities that would like to start to <lb/>collaborate within such organizational solutions, which help them gain access <lb/>to information and financing, as well as to establish mechanisms at the level of the <lb/>Member states for promoting and developing them. therefore, the Member states <lb/>have the role of creating an institutional (regulatory) environment for the effective <lb/>functioning of energy communities within their areas. <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>and committees in a norwegian island parish,&quot; Human Relations 7, 1954, no. 1, pp. 39-58. it <lb/>should be emphasized that it had already been noticed then that the logic of networking was based <lb/>on minimizing the importance of hierarchical (vertical) ties and maximizing the importance of <lb/>horizontal (horizontal) ties. <lb/>3 oJ L 328/122 of 21.12.2018. <lb/>4 the red ii directive does not introduce a legal definition of an energy community, leaving <lb/>Member states with the discretion to choose the organizational forms in which such initiatives can be <lb/>&quot;enclosed,&quot; restricting themselves to purely specifying the domains in the chain of the energy market <lb/>processes in which these communities can operate. the distinguishing feature of an energy community <lb/>is cooperation to satisfy the energy needs of its members. <lb/>5 an energy community is an initiative that is open to all; its participants can be household <lb/>consumers using energy for satisfying individual needs as well as prosumers, enterprises with <lb/>systems used for generating renewable energy. However, the involvement of enterprises in energy <lb/>cooperatives must not constitute their primary (main) business or professional activity. <lb/></listBibl>

    <body>the second -organizational -plane is determined by the organizational and <lb/>legal forms of energy communities adopted in the legislation of the individual <lb/>Member states, which actually constitute the organizational and legal forms that <lb/>distributed energy can take in a given Member state. simultaneously, these or-<lb/>ganizational and legal forms should be treated as an element of the process of <lb/>implementing and adjusting national regulations to the provisions of the red ii <lb/>directive. the Polish legislator specifies two fundamental organizational and legal <lb/>forms of energy communities in the area of dispersed energy, namely energy clus-<lb/>ters and energy cooperatives. <lb/>2. energy clusters <lb/>the legal definition of an energy cluster was introduced into the Polish legal <lb/>order by the act amending the act on renewable energy sources and certain other <lb/>acts of 22 June 2016 (hereinafter the res act). 6 an energy cluster is formally <lb/>a civil law agreement, which can include natural persons, legal persons, scientific <lb/>entities, research institutes and local government units. it addresses the generation <lb/>and balancing of demand, distribution or trading of energy from renewable en-<lb/>ergy sources or other sources or fuels within a distribution network, with a rated <lb/>voltage of less than 110 kV, within the area of operation of this cluster that does <lb/>not extend beyond the borders of one county in the meaning of the act on the <lb/>county government of 5 June 1998, 7 or 5 municipalities, in the meaning of <lb/>the act on Municipal government of 8 March 1990 8 ; the energy cluster is rep-<lb/>resented by a coordinator who is a cooperative, association, foundation or any <lb/>member of the energy cluster appointed for this purpose in a civil law agreement, <lb/>hereinafter referred to as &quot;energy cluster coordinator.&quot; on 1 october 2023, the <lb/>amendment to the res act came into force, which implements another part of <lb/>the red ii directive into the Polish legal order. the amendment to the res act <lb/>accelerates and at the same time facilitates the development of energy clusters. <lb/>the amendment modifies the definition of an energy cluster; it broadens the per-<lb/>sonal scope of cluster participants -at least one local government unit has to be <lb/>an obligatory participant in a cluster, and it broadens the scope of its activities to <lb/>include energy storage. after the amendment, clusters may operate in the area of <lb/>one county, five neighbouring municipalities and additionally in the area of one <lb/>distribution network operator (dso). 9 <lb/></body>

    <body>the legal definition of an energy cluster sets the general framework and <lb/>mechanisms of operation of energy clusters in Poland; it strongly highlights the <lb/>concept of locating energy generation close to the places to which it is supplied, <lb/>which, apart from financial issues, 10 seems to be an important determinant of the <lb/>perceived activity in creating energy clusters in Poland. the specification and si-<lb/>multaneously the desired simplification of the legal definition of an energy cluster <lb/>justifies the description of this structure as one based on a cooperation agreement <lb/>between diverse locally operating entities which generate, consume, store and sell <lb/>electricity, heat, cold, electricity and fuels. it is estimated that Poland currently has <lb/>approximately seventy energy clusters, the logic of operation of which is based on <lb/>the concept of a network organization. a network organization is constituted by <lb/>horizontal cooperation relations between entities that are organizationally and le-<lb/>gally independent, the activities of which are targeted at achieving a common <lb/>objective. the cooperation that is typical of network organizations is the mani-<lb/>festation of so-called positive interdependence. 11 From the point of view of a net-<lb/>work organization, an energy cluster is a relatively permanent group of autono-<lb/>mous and specialized business entities operating in the same or related sectors, as <lb/>well as entities providing services to these business entities, and local government <lb/>administration and scientific entities. the literature on the subject refers to four <lb/>elements that give a universal meaning to the term energy cluster: <lb/>nucleus of the cluster -key participants of a cluster (consumers, generators, <lb/>cluster coordinator). <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>into the grid by the parties to the cluster agreement must come from res, and the total power of the <lb/>installations put into operation in the energy cluster -must not exceed 150 MW, and must enable no <lb/>less than 40% of the total annual demand of the parties to the energy cluster to be covered during <lb/>the year. <lb/>10 the financial benefits of the participants of an energy cluster arise from the ability of the <lb/>producers (generators) operating within the cluster to obtain higher prices from the sale of energy, <lb/>while being able to meet consumer demand more cheaply. <lb/>11 Positive interdependence is one of the three types of social interdependence identified <lb/>by the american psychologist Morton deutsch, who also distinguished a state of negative <lb/>interdependence (competition) and a state of deficit of interdependence (isolation). see: M. deutsch, <lb/>&quot;a theory of cooperation and competition,&quot; Human Relations 2, 1949, no. 2, pp. 129-152. Positive <lb/>interdependence arises when there is a &quot;positive&quot; correlation between entities pursuing autonomous <lb/>(individual) objectives. Positive interdependence is a state in which, when interpreting specific <lb/>economic, technological, legal, social, etc. conditions, a particular entity concludes that it can <lb/>achieve its individual objectives if and only if another entity operating in the same conditions is <lb/>able to achieve its individual objectives. the existence of a group of entities pursuing objectives <lb/>that are not in conflict with each other and which share the same system of values, convictions <lb/>and expectations can constitute the impetus for seeking structural methods of consolidating their <lb/>compatible aims, activities and interests. network organizations are among these structural methods <lb/>of consolidating compatible interests, which are always dependent on the specific socio-economic <lb/>context. <lb/></listBibl>

    <body>supporting sectors -business entities that serve and support the nucleus of <lb/>the cluster. <lb/>&quot;Hard&quot; infrastructure -necessary for achieving the cluster&apos;s objectives. this <lb/>especially applies to the distribution infrastructure; the creation of an energy clus-<lb/>ter is not always related to the need to create its own distribution infrastructure, <lb/>as it is possible to use existing energy distribution network media. However, in <lb/>certain cases the design of the cluster&apos;s own distribution infrastructure will be the <lb/>most financially advantageous solution for its nucleus. <lb/>&quot;soft&quot; infrastructure -research facilities, local government institutions, busi-<lb/>ness development agencies and stakeholders. <lb/>the logic of creating energy network collectives encompasses the activation <lb/>of local communities in terms of cooperation and the generation of energy from <lb/>renewable sources. the energy cluster, as a network organization, is intended to <lb/>enable energy self-sufficiency to be achieved in the municipality and to bring <lb/>about an increase in the level of energy security. the pursuit of an objective pre-<lb/>sented in this way requires a high level of investment in technical, generation and <lb/>metering infrastructure and therefore the commitment of private capital, know-<lb/>ledge and activity. energy clusters are therefore a networking formula for achiev-<lb/>ing the planned objective, which is achievable through cooperation with the <lb/>involvement of external capital. <lb/>the essence of a network organization is to achieve the effect of synergy <lb/>through the cooperation of its participants. therefore, the coordination mech-<lb/>anisms that are typical of an energy cluster, which have a subjective and an <lb/>objective dimension, play an important role within the energy cluster. the so-<lb/>called coordinator of the network organization is responsible for the efficiency <lb/>of coordination in the subject dimension. 12 the legislator emphasizes the role of <lb/>the coordinator as a link that represents the cluster&apos;s interests externally, 13 while the <lb/>logic of operation forces the coordinator (the network creator, broker, network <lb/>centre) to simultaneously play an important role directed towards the inside of <lb/>the cluster -to secure the ability to pursue the individual interests of the members <lb/>of the cluster and reconcile the often conflicting and particular interests of its <lb/>members. the need for the coordinator&apos;s inward-looking activity arises from the <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>12 the act on res (article 2[15a]) stipulates that the coordinator representing the cluster&apos;s <lb/>interests externally is a cooperative, association, foundation, or any member of the energy cluster spe-<lb/>cified in the civil law agreement, who is appointed to represent the cluster (it can also be an entity <lb/>established for this purpose, e.g. a partnership or a company). the coordinator&apos;s functions laid down <lb/>by the legislator are to manage and represent the energy cluster in business dealings, regarding the <lb/>projects that are being implemented. the coordinator may be and, in practice, often is the initiator <lb/>and founder of the cluster, or a new entity specified by the participants in the cluster contract. the <lb/>act does not specify the scope and principles of representation by the coordinator in the cluster; it <lb/>leaves the freedom to make this decision to the members of the cluster. <lb/>13 the statutory emphasis of the activities of the cluster&apos;s coordinator, which are externally <lb/>oriented, arises from the lack of personality and legal capacity of this network form of cooperation. <lb/></listBibl>

    <body>duality of relations that are typical of an energy cluster, i.e. the simultaneous pres-<lb/>ence of competition and cooperation. 14 the phenomenon of simultaneous compe-<lb/>tition and cooperation that exists in clusters is referred to as coopetition (from the <lb/>combination of the words cooperation and competition). 15 the cluster coordinator <lb/>is responsible for preparing the rules and harmonizing cooperation between the <lb/>network participants and the stakeholders. the ability to cooperate despite <lb/>the existence of frequent individual competing objectives in economic, technical <lb/>and organizational terms is important, namely those of electricity consumers, lo-<lb/>cal government, which is responsible, among other things, for preparing energy <lb/>supply plans, as well as generators and distributors. coordination in the objective <lb/>dimension in energy clusters is created by two mechanisms: contractual and rela-<lb/>tional. the source of the identification of these two coordination mechanisms lies <lb/>in the division of organizations into formal and informal ones. <lb/>the criteria for the typology of network organizations are sought in various areas <lb/>which cannot be discussed exhaustively because of the restrictions on this article. the <lb/>determinants of the delimitation of organizational networks, which are of significance <lb/>in the context of the analysis of the logic of the operation of energy clusters, include <lb/>the criterion from the praxeological theory of organization of the division of organi-<lb/>zational relations into formal and informal relations, 16 which simultaneously enables <lb/>a distinction to be made between formal and informal network organizations. <lb/>Formal network organizations are established via a contract as the legal basis <lb/>for the establishment of the cooperation. the contract should provide a general <lb/>legal framework, which is optimal for cooperation and trade taking place within <lb/>the network organization, as well as between the organizational network and the <lb/>consumers. in the english language literature, the operation of formal network or-<lb/>ganizations is identified with the presence of so-called mechanisms of contractual <lb/>coordination, of which open, formalized and written contracts are an attribute. 17 <lb/>the contractual relations between the contracting parties form the object of the <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>14 the definition of clusters in the Polish legal system, which was introduced in the <lb/>regulation of the Minister of the economy of 2 december 2006 on the award by the Polish <lb/>agency for enterprise development of financial aid not related to operational programmes, also <lb/>emphasizes this duality, defining a cluster as &quot;a spatial and sectoral concentration of at least <lb/>10 entities working for economic development or innovation. When performing their activities <lb/>within one or several neighbouring voivodships, they compete and cooperate with each other in <lb/>the same or related sectors and are connected by an extensive network of relations of a formal and <lb/>informal nature&quot; (Journal of Laws of 2006, no. 226, item 1651). <lb/>15 see: k.

    <body>mechanisms of contractual coordination, by setting the formal framework for the <lb/>exchange of various types of goods, services and information. therefore, a for-<lb/>malized contract is considered a key element of the economy ensuring the security <lb/>and efficiency of transactions. the rights and duties of the parties arise from the <lb/>wording of the contract, the most important elements of which are: (1) the written <lb/>form specifying the rights and duties of the parties, (2) the specification of the <lb/>subject matter of the performance, and (3) a presentation of the consequences of <lb/>the possible failure to perform or the improper performance of the contract. 18 <lb/>the operation of energy clusters is based on a contract, which is referred to <lb/>in the act on res as a civil law contract. essentially, the term &quot;civil law contract&quot; <lb/>used by the legislator refers to contracts, the wording of which is an emanation <lb/>of the will of the parties to a specific legal relationship -so-called unnamed con-<lb/>tracts. the development of unnamed contracts in practice is a consequence of the <lb/>intensification and increase in the complexity of the relationships into which pub-<lb/>lic and private sector entities enter. an unnamed contract is a type of contract that <lb/>has not been regulated by the legislator in any act of law. such a legal relationship is <lb/>based on contractual freedom, as regulated in article 353 of the civil code, 19 with <lb/>limitations on the freedom of forming the contractual relationship (the properties of <lb/>the contractual relationship, the provisions of the law and the principles of social <lb/>co-existence), which also apply to the cluster contract. With the reservation of the <lb/>need to comply with the required legal form of a given transaction, their breach will <lb/>result in the sanction of unconditional invalidity of a contract that is in conflict with <lb/>the law, as provided for in article 58 of the civil code. the impulse for the parties <lb/>to a specific legal relationship to stipulate &quot;innovative&quot; wording of the contract is <lb/>usually the need to create a new type of business relationship, especially if the con-<lb/>tractual terms defined by the provisions of the law prove to be insufficient. in the <lb/>act on res, an unnamed contract, which is referred to as a civil law contract, seems <lb/>to be one of the elements of the creation of modern economic law, the attribute of <lb/>which is flexibility.

    <body>of autonomy and the said flexibility in specifying the rights and duties of the par-<lb/>ticipants. essentially, two types of contractual coordination mechanisms should <lb/>be distinguished in the cluster&apos;s activities, as presented in Figure 1. <lb/>the distinction of the formal categories of network organizations is an appro-<lb/>priate reason for drawing attention to the function of the law in creating relations in <lb/>an organizational network such as an energy cluster. at least three interconnected <lb/>functions of the law should be mentioned. the first -coordination -is reflected <lb/>in the creation of a framework for cooperation within the energy cluster. specific <lb/>sub-functions can be identified within the coordination function: (1) integrative, <lb/>bringing together compatible interests of the cluster&apos;s participants, (2) stabilizing, <lb/>facilitating the resolution of potential conflicts between members of the cluster, <lb/>(3) distributive, specifying roles and influence within the cluster, (4) adaptive, en-<lb/>abling the modification of the content of the contract and therefore the principles <lb/>of cooperation between participants of the cluster to the changing internal and <lb/>external conditions. <lb/>the second function of the law -reduction -refers to the ability to reduce <lb/>the asymmetry of information accompanying the conclusion of any contract. the <lb/>function of reducing information asymmetry is reflected in the creation of the so-<lb/>called network rent. network rent is the sum of the savings obtained as a result of <lb/>the conclusion of a contract creating a network organization and the savings aris-<lb/>ing from the principles of cooperation, communication and horizontal coordina-<lb/>tion contained in that contract. 20 network rent is simultaneously the added value <lb/>reflected in the financial benefits obtained by entities from their participation in <lb/>the network, as well as in the external benefits that are a positive type of so-called <lb/>externalities. the concept of externalities introduced into economic theory by <lb/></body>

    <body>alfred Marshall, 21 is now considered one of the most important analytical cat-<lb/>egories in environmental economics. 22 externalities are divided into two types: <lb/>negative (external costs) and positive (external benefits). negative externalities <lb/>arise when horizontally-connected organizations can pass on the costs of their <lb/>operations to entities that cannot participate in the benefits of those operations <lb/>and who are not parties to the contract. an example of negative externalities is the <lb/>environmental degradation caused by the conventional energy sector -e.g. trans-<lb/>port based on first generation biofuels. therefore, the directive of the european <lb/>Parliament and of the council of 23 april 2009 on the promotion of the use of <lb/>energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing direc-<lb/>tives 2001/77/ec and 2003/30/ec 23 has not only started the momentum of the <lb/>transition to higher-generation biofuels, but has also started the long-term process <lb/>of levelling out this example of negative externalities. <lb/>Positive externalities arise when horizontally-connected organizations pro-<lb/>vide benefits from their operations to other entities without directly receiving <lb/>compensation for this. examples of positive externalities are the processes of cre-<lb/>ating energy clusters, which, while starting up network rent directly for its par-<lb/>ticipants, simultaneously transfer the effects of their existence to other entities in <lb/>the form of benefits identified at local and/or regional level, which include an <lb/>increase in energy security, a reduction in the economy&apos;s energy consumption, <lb/>the creation of new jobs, an increase in the attractiveness of investment land by <lb/>reducing the costs of energy supply, the stimulation of economic development, the <lb/>availability and development of low-carbon public transport and the reduction of <lb/>harmful gas emissions. the third function of the law -optimization -involves the <lb/>creation of a legal basis for the conclusion of a contract and the execution of its <lb/>provisions, enabling the participants of the cluster to reduce transaction costs. 24 <lb/>the concluded contract creating the energy cluster is a result of the clash of inter-<lb/>ests of the parties to the contract, who, due to their awareness of the existence of <lb/></body>

Ex-ante <lb/>transaction costs arise at the stage of preparation of the contract, examples being the costs of finding <lb/>a partner for the cooperation, the costs of the negotiations, the coordination costs of establishing <lb/>mutual obligations, information processing and exchange, the costs of preparing analyses and <lb/>expert studies related to the subject matter of the future contract. In tractu costs appear during the <lb/>cooperation; these include costs of monitoring the activities of the other participants of the network <lb/>(with regard to the performance of the provisions of the contract) and the costs of renegotiating <lb/>the provisions of the contract. Ex-post transaction costs arise after the end of the cooperation and <lb/>are primarily related to the enforcement of unfulfilled provisions of the contract. see: a. chrisidu-<lb/>Budnik, Od biurokracji do New Public Governance.

    <body>the already mentioned positive interdependence, are looking for appropriate ways <lb/>to formalize the terms of cooperation and therefore improve exchange within the <lb/>network organization. the optimization function enables the efficiency of each <lb/>participant in the cluster, as well as the whole of the socio-economic system, to <lb/>be increased. this is because, if the participants of a network organization &quot;win&quot; <lb/>within the framework of a specific contract, the whole economy ultimately wins. 25 <lb/>the essence of a network organization is therefore to achieve synergy through the <lb/>cooperation of the participants of the cluster, whereby this effect is achieved <lb/>through the participant&apos;s ability to align his individual operational activities to the <lb/>principles of operation of the whole of the network organization. <lb/>informal network organizations are created on the basis of the standards of <lb/>trust and reciprocity. in the english language literature, the operation of a network <lb/>of this type is identified with the presence of so-called relational coordination <lb/>mechanisms and interpersonal capital. 26 the acceptance of the issue of relational <lb/>coordination mechanisms in the analysis of energy clusters enables their signifi-<lb/>cance to be highlighted in two stages of operation of such energy collectives. <lb/>stage 1, which is referred to in the literature as the pre-cluster stage 27 and applies <lb/>to activities constituting the so-called cluster initiative, which is the initial stage of <lb/>forming specific and distinctive connections between the participants of the clus-<lb/>ter. 28 at the pre-cluster stage, the presence of informal networks of connections <lb/>and trust constitutes a stable foundation for future processes of formalizing coop-<lb/>eration between the parties. stage 1 refers to the situation where the formal basis of <lb/>cooperation is still in statu nascendi, in the sense that the network organization is <lb/></body>

    <body>not yet formalized, i.e. a civil law contract has not been concluded. 29 in stage 2 -ac-<lb/>celeration -combined with the operation of an already formalized network orga-<lb/>nization, the presence of relational coordination mechanisms is based on the exis-<lb/>tence of trust and standards of reciprocity between the participants of the cluster. <lb/>standards of reciprocity refer not only to the manoeuvrability and symmetry of <lb/>the relationship, but also to learning to cooperate and communicate. Learning is <lb/>a process that is inherent in the cooperation rather than being its result, and, in this <lb/>sense, standards of reciprocity are dialogical standards. reciprocity is a standard <lb/>that stabilizes cooperation in already formalized network organizations, because <lb/>it ensures complementarity of the rights and duties of the participants. 30 the ef-<lb/>fectiveness of energy clusters depends on the rational and effective use of tangible <lb/>and intangible capital. tangible capital is formed by locally available energy re-<lb/>sources, renewable energy sources, innovativeness and entrepreneurship in energy <lb/>generation, transmission, distribution, as well as the management of energy con-<lb/>sumption. intangible capital is jointly created by two mechanisms of coordination: <lb/>contractual and relational. the quality of the contractual coordination mechanism <lb/>is a derivative of the ability to design an economically efficient mechanism which <lb/>fully reflects the intention of the parties to the contract. the primary function <lb/>of the contractual coordination mechanisms is the development of legal norms <lb/>which, in the context of both internal agreements between members and external <lb/>agreements between the energy cluster as a network organization and the business <lb/>entities in its environment, ensure optimal trade. relational coordination mecha-<lb/>nisms have a complementary function to contractual coordination mechanisms, <lb/>and specifically the internal component identified in Figure 1. at stage 1, the pres-<lb/>ence of relational standards (trust and reciprocity) facilitates the conclusion of <lb/>a contract constituting an energy cluster, because it reduces ex-ante transaction <lb/>costs and, just like the optimizing function of the law, reduces information asym-<lb/>metry. the relational coordination mechanisms at stage 2 enable the elimination <lb/>of the inevitable conflicts of interest which arise during the cooperation between <lb/>the participants of the energy cluster and therefore create contracts improving the <lb/>principles of cooperation between them (the learning effect). essentially, contrac-<lb/>tual and relational coordination mechanisms are interrelated, because they affect <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>29 the &quot;transition&quot; process of the cooperation from non-formalized to formalized applies <lb/>not only to energy clusters. it is, for example, a qualitative determinant of the interaction between <lb/>public administrations and environmental organizations with regard to environmental protection. <lb/>in practice, the successful course of informal horizontal interactions is a significant impetus for <lb/>strengthening and deepening this cooperation through its formalization. the legal basis for the <lb/>transition from informal cooperation to formalized interoperation is contained in article 45(1) of the <lb/>act on the provision of information on the environment and its protection and environmental impact <lb/>assessments of 3 october 2008 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2020, item 283, as amended). <lb/>30 see: t.

    <body>the quality of the performance of the processes and investments within the energy <lb/>clusters, the use of resources by their participants, the level, measurement and <lb/>analysis of the results and the management of relations with the environment. <lb/>a legitimate question is: what is the appropriate unit of analysis of the en-<lb/>vironment of a network organization which is an energy cluster? one of these <lb/>areas of analysis is the ecosystem concept. 31 an ecosystem -or the ecosystem <lb/>of a cluster -is a comprehensive system, the elements of which are the cluster&apos;s <lb/>nucleus, the entities from the supporting sectors, the entities serving the &quot;hard&quot; <lb/>infrastructure and the entities forming the &quot;soft&quot; infrastructure. What is impor-<lb/>tant is that all four elements co-create the ecosystem and, in this perspective, the <lb/>energy cluster does not adapt to the environment, but co-creates it. the reference <lb/>to the issue of the unnamed agreement as the basis for the creation of the cluster <lb/>justifies the argument that the legislator accepted the need to deformalize this <lb/>type of network form of cooperation and granted the participants autonomy in the <lb/>area of freely shaping the rights and duties of the cluster&apos;s nucleus, the objectives, <lb/>as well as the methods and means of their implementation. Viewing the autonomy <lb/>contained in the cluster agreement from the point of view of the concept of an eco-<lb/>system makes it clear that the achievement of the cluster&apos;s objectives, which are to <lb/>ensure the energy self-sufficiency of municipalities, to increase and rationalize the <lb/>use of local energy resources, to ensure the sustainable development of distributed <lb/>energy sources, including renewable sources, and finally the ability of the individual <lb/>participants to obtain financial benefits, depends on (1) the appropriate selection <lb/>of participants of the cluster according to, among other things, technical criteria, <lb/>(2) the optimal configuration of cooperation relations between them and (3) appro-<lb/>priate access to hard infrastructure from the point of view of the ability to generate <lb/>a profit. <lb/>3. energy cooperative <lb/>the other local form of energy collective in addition to the energy cluster <lb/>is the energy cooperative. an energy cooperative is an organizational and legal <lb/>form of association of citizens interested in generating energy from renewable <lb/></body>

Like energy clusters, energy cooperatives are locally activated mecha-<lb/>nisms of support in the generation of energy from renewable energy sources. the <lb/>act amending the act on renewable energy sources and certain other acts of 19 <lb/>July 2019 32 intensified efforts to achieve a 15% share of energy from renewable <lb/>sources in final energy consumption. the legislator attaches particular importance <lb/>in this to energy cooperatives, while creating a system of institutional support for <lb/>such energy cooperatives. an energy cooperative is a cooperative in the meaning <lb/>of the cooperative Law of 16 september 1982 33 or the act on Farmers&apos; coopera-<lb/>tives of 4 october 2018, 34 the objects of which are the generation of electricity <lb/>or biogas or heat, in renewable energy source installations and balancing the de-<lb/>mand for electricity or biogas or heat, exclusively for the energy cooperative&apos;s <lb/>own needs and those of its members, who are connected to a power distribution <lb/>network within a defined area with a rated voltage of less than 110 kV or a gas <lb/>distribution network, or a district heating network. 35 the statutory reference to <lb/>cooperative law means that the energy cooperative is subject to the regime of <lb/>provisions which are appropriate to cooperative law, which apply to the require-<lb/>ments for establishing and registering the cooperative, the principles of conduct-<lb/>ing operational activities and the principles of laying down internal regulations. 36 <lb/>the objects of the energy cooperative are the generation of electricity or heat or <lb/>biogas in renewable energy facilities owned by the energy cooperative or its mem-<lb/>bers. additional conditions for the operation of an energy cooperative include: <lb/>1. conducting business within a rural or urban and rural municipality in the <lb/>meaning of the provisions on public statistics or in an area of no more <lb/>than three such municipalities directly neighbouring with each other; <lb/>2. it must have less than 1,000 members; <lb/>3. if its business involves the generation of (a) electricity: the total installed <lb/>electrical capacity of all renewable energy source installations is to enable <lb/>no less than 70% of the needs of the energy cooperative and its members <lb/>to be covered during the year and is not to exceed 10 MW, (b) heat: the <lb/>total achievable thermal capacity is not to exceed 30 MW, (c) biogas: <lb/>the annual capacity of all installations is not to exceed 40 million m 3 . <lb/></body>

    <body>4. conclusions <lb/>alongside energy cooperatives, energy clusters have been treated by the Pol-<lb/>ish legislator as two basic forms of creation of support mechanisms for generating <lb/>energy from res. Both models -energy clusters and energy cooperatives -have <lb/>their advantages in terms of energy production and distribution. Ultimately, which <lb/>model is more beneficial for a region depends on the individual needs and condi-<lb/>tions of the local community. energy clusters occur as groups of organisations and <lb/>companies pooling their resources to produce and distribute energy on a larger <lb/>scale. the cluster initiative is often based on innovative technological solutions, <lb/>resulting in more efficient use of energy sources and increased production effi-<lb/>ciency. energy cooperatives, on the other hand, are organisations owned by mem-<lb/>bers of the local community who jointly manage the production and distribution <lb/>of energy. this type of initiative is very often based on a participatory model, and <lb/>this allows for greater involvement of local reside the legal regulations can no <lb/>doubt create incentives for the development of energy collectives. examples of <lb/>impulses supporting development by energy cooperatives include the opportunity <lb/>to apply discounts for billing for electricity that is generated and consumed by <lb/>the members of the cooperative who have been granted the status of prosumers <lb/>by the law. an analysis of the legal regulations shows that, compared to energy <lb/>clusters, energy cooperatives have gained a much larger scope of institutional <lb/>support for their operation. the legislator has given priority to of energy commu-<lb/>nities this type as a fundamental component of distributed energy. However, the <lb/>examination of the establishment of energy collectives in Poland reveals a certain <lb/>paradox, namely that there are already several dozen energy clusters which have <lb/>not yet received support in Poland, while energy cooperatives with such support <lb/>are not actually being established. this situation arises from the presence of the <lb/>determinants of the energy transition and their impact on its effectiveness. 37 the <lb/>interaction between legal and social conditions and the barriers to change that <lb/>exist within them is significant. the legal regulations, as well as the attitudes, <lb/>convictions and awareness of members of a given community, determine whether <lb/>it is possible to make any changes, as well as the quality of these changes. the per-<lb/>ceived lack of activity in establishing energy cooperatives arises precisely from <lb/>the social conditions, namely barriers in the form of their negative perception in <lb/>Poland, which are perceived as a relic from the times of the People&apos;s republic <lb/>of Poland. the legal and social conditions can be positioned on matrix of changes <lb/>in the area of energy transformation (Figure 2). <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>37 the article has addressed the existence of conditions (legal, organizational, social, technological <lb/>and commercial) which are interrelated and therefore exert an influence on the effectiveness of the <lb/>transformation. <lb/></listBibl>

    <body>the design of the matrix is based on axes scaled from 1 to 9, on which two <lb/>orientations in the introduction of changes are presented: the orientation to con-<lb/>duct transformations on the basis of legal regulations (so-called hard levers) and <lb/>the orientation to conduct transformations on the basis of changes in the ways of <lb/>thinking, the perception of the environment, attitudes and habits (soft levers). it <lb/>becomes possible to distinguish five ways of bringing about change on this basis: <lb/>1. Box 1.1 is a passive attitude to the initiation of changes in the regulations <lb/>and a change in mind sets, habits and practice. <lb/>2. Box 1.9 is an approach focused on changes in the law, while abandoning <lb/>efforts to change the state of mind prevailing in the given population. <lb/>3. Box 9.1 reflects a strong orientation towards transforming existing atti-<lb/>tudes, while downplaying the significance of the hard levers. <lb/>4. Box 5.5 can be described as a balanced (moderate) orientation in the <lb/>transformation of legal regulations and attitudes, convictions and prac-<lb/>tices. <lb/>low <lb/>legal orientation <lb/>high <lb/>9 <lb/>1.9 <lb/>9.9 <lb/>8 <lb/>7 <lb/>6 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>5 <lb/>4 <lb/>3 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>9.1 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>9 <lb/>low <lb/>attitude orientation <lb/>high <lb/>Figure 2.

    <body>5. Box 9.9 is very much oriented towards making harmonious changes in <lb/>the law, as well as people&apos;s awareness. <lb/>the matrix of changes in energy transition can be treated as an analytical <lb/>tool for implementing solutions to achieve the eU&apos;s climate protection objectives. <lb/>the relatively high level of activity of business entities in the creation of cluster <lb/>initiatives arises from the advantages created by the network organization and the <lb/>dissemination of the idea of clustering. the expansiveness of this form of energy <lb/>community should be included in box 9.1. the slow pace of the establishment of <lb/>energy cooperatives that was discussed in this article can be positioned in box 1.9, <lb/>even though the creation of institutional support for this form of energy collective, <lb/>namely the attitude to the idea of cooperatives in Poland, is negative; this largely <lb/>arises from the fact that cooperatives have so far been systemically weakened, <lb/>liquidated and perceived as a relic of a centrally planned economy and, after all, <lb/>energy cooperatives are an example of decentralized civic energy generation. <lb/></body>
