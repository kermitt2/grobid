Conclusion. <lb/>ABSTRACT: It is said that no book on the common law surpasses the importance of Sir <lb/>William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. But it is also said that the <lb/>Commentaries is of questionable merit, with aspects of it downright incoherent. The most <lb/>fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this disparaging characterization is <lb/>its discussion and use of what it usually calls "the law of nature" -and what we these <lb/>days usually call "natural law." Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually <lb/>many mistakes -of natural law? This article answers that it is not the Commentaries, but <lb/>rather its critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from the <lb/>expectation that Blackstone's natural law would take after Thomas Aquinas's (or even <lb/>Christopher St. German's) natural law. But readers of the Commentaries who allow <lb/>Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable treatment that animates <lb/>the whole. Blackstone's natural law owes much to two influences, Roman law and the <lb/>Anglican Church. The second influence is the more distinctive and guides Blackstone's <lb/>response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural law as an order immanent in <lb/>human law, an order especially prominent within the common law. Seen in this light, <lb/>natural law provides the foundation for the Commentaries and a foundation for <lb/>understanding law in our own day. <lb/>KEYWORDS: Blackstone; Natural Law; Roman Law; Anglicanism; Law and Religion <lb/>UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA LAW REVIEW <lb/>ISSN 2531-6133 <lb/>[VOL.4:2 2019] <lb/>This article is released under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY) <lb/>325 <lb/></front>

            <body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>"[P]erhaps the most important single book . . . in the history of the <lb/>common law" is Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of <lb/>England (hereinafter Commentaries). 1 No other book but the Bible had a <lb/>greater role in generating American institutions 2 and the nineteenth <lb/>century alone saw about one hundred American versions. 3 It is said that <lb/>the Commentaries led early American courts to decide from principles, not <lb/>precedents. 4 But it is said also that the Commentaries is of questionable <lb/>merit, 5 with aspects of it downright incoherent. 6 <lb/>The most fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this <lb/>disparaging characterization is its discussion and use of what it usually <lb/>calls "the law of nature." 7 "Natural law" is the term more frequently used <lb/>these days for a transcendent legal order to which human law necessarily <lb/>bears some relationship. Because Blackstone's concept of the "law of <lb/>nature" is similar to that of contemporary "natural law," this article <lb/></body>

The present article <lb/>happens to highlight elements of the Commentaries that commended it to Americans <lb/>of the Founding: "Even those who rejected Blackstone's anti-republican emphasis on <lb/>parliamentary omnipotence . . . had no difficulty in accepting the validity of Blackstone's <lb/>exposition of English common law as founded on custom, divine law, and the law of <lb/>nature, hence providing an entirely appropriate legal foundation for the incipient USA." <lb/>Wilfrid Prest, General Editor's Introduction to 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES ON THE <lb/>LAWS OF ENGLAND, at vii, xiv (Wilfrid Prest ed., Oxford Univ.

See infra text accompanying notes 41-42. This seeming lack of uniformity and <lb/>rigor in terminology certainly does not foster coherence in the Commentaries. On the other <lb/>hand, Aquinas seems to do likewise. See infra note 33. <lb/></listBibl>

		    <body>often will use the latter term instead. In this parlance, the concern <lb/>becomes the charge of incoherence in Blackstone's discussion and use of <lb/>natural law. Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually many <lb/>mistakes -of natural law? <lb/>This article proposes that it is not the Commentaries, but rather its <lb/>critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from <lb/>the expectation that Blackstone's natural law would take after Thomas <lb/>Aquinas's 8 (or even Christopher St.German's) 9 natural law. As Blackstone <lb/>disappoints these expectations, he has met with criticisms that his <lb/>treatment of natural law is a sloppy pro forma performance that even he <lb/>himself does not take seriously. But readers of the Commentaries who <lb/>allow Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable <lb/>treatment that animates the whole of the Commentaries. <lb/>Blackstone's natural law owes much to two influences. The first is <lb/>Roman law, especially as captured in the Corpus Juris Civilis. 10 The second <lb/>is the Anglican church, 11 which is the more distinctive and guides <lb/>Blackstone's response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural <lb/>law as an order immanent in human law, an order especially prominent <lb/>within the common law. Seen in this light, natural law provides the <lb/>foundation for the Commentaries. While doing so, it also provides a <lb/>foundation for understanding law even today, a foundation actually in use <lb/>far more than some might think. <lb/></body>

		    <body>2. THE COMMENTARIES AND THE COMMENTATORS <lb/>After unproductive struggles to develop a successful practice at the bar, <lb/>Blackstone's professional life began to flourish with his Oxford lectures <lb/>on the common law. 12 The Commentaries is not these lectures merely <lb/>recast, delivered as they were to an audience of mere teenagers. 13 <lb/>Nevertheless, the Commentaries is designed to teach and Blackstone <lb/>wanted his readers to learn. 14 The readers for whom he wrote were <lb/>"young nobility and gentry," 15 the leading laymen of the realm. 16 Chief <lb/>among these were those who were or would become legislators, and <lb/>Blackstone was determined to instruct them not to harm by statute the <lb/>liberties of Englishmen. 17 <lb/>Blackstone's aim to instruct lay readers shaped the Commentaries. <lb/>This aim trained the focus of the Commentaries upon substantive rules of <lb/>law, lending the Commentaries both its pathbreaking distinctive and also <lb/>the daunting obstacle to its creation. 18 Blackstone's object was to teach <lb/>laymen the laws of property, crimes, torts, and such -not how to draft <lb/>legal instruments or plead at bar. 19 Beyond teaching the substance of the <lb/>law to laymen, this substantive-law focus gave "lawyers a new vision of <lb/>the law." 20 The Commentaries imposed order and a clarifying system on the <lb/></body>

            <body>jumble that was English law. 21 This arrangement was a key to its success. 22 <lb/>It is Blackstone's use of natural law that undergirds this arrangement. 23 <lb/>Near the beginning of the Commentaries is Blackstone's <lb/>introductory discussion of law. 24 Law is "a rule of action dictated by some <lb/>superior being," and laws considered as rules for human conduct are "the <lb/>precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature <lb/>endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded to make use of <lb/>those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior." 25 The obligation <lb/>to obey law derives from dependence upon the lawgiver, "[a]nd <lb/>consequently as man depends absolutely upon his maker for every thing, <lb/>it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker's will. <lb/>THIS will of his maker is called the law of nature." 26 In its scope, <lb/>Blackstone's law of nature reminds one of Aquinas's natural law. 27 <lb/></body>

            <body>The voluntaristic stamp of Blackstone's law of nature -it is the will of <lb/>God -diminishes somewhat in the next words of the Commentaries. <lb/>God's wisdom leads him to prescribe only what corresponds to the nature <lb/>of things and in this he conforms to "the eternal, immutable laws of good <lb/>and evil." 28 Human reason is able to discover these laws, and God's <lb/>goodness leads him to link our happiness with obedience to the law of <lb/>nature. "For he has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven <lb/>the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the <lb/>latter cannot be obtained but by observing the former; and, if the former <lb/>be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter." 29 This link between <lb/>the law of nature and human happiness "is the foundation of what we call <lb/>ethics, or natural law." 30 Natural law comprises articles that "amount to <lb/>no more than demonstrating, that this or that action tends to man's real <lb/>happiness, and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it <lb/>is a part of the law of nature." 31 <lb/>Blackstone then renders explicit the supreme authority of the law of <lb/>nature: <lb/>THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated <lb/>by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. <lb/>It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: <lb/>no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such <lb/>of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, <lb/>mediately or immediately, from this original. 32 <lb/>Again, Blackstone's law of nature brings to mind Aquinas's natural law. 33 <lb/>But Blackstone's approach to what he calls natural law differs <lb/>profoundly from that of Aquinas. We already have noted that the <lb/></body>

But if in any point it differs from the law of <lb/>nature, it is no longer a law but a corruption of law."). <lb/></listBibl>

            <body>Commentaries describes natural law as a set of demonstrations that <lb/>certain human conduct leads to human happiness and consequently <lb/>comports with the law of nature. 34 This description is nothing like <lb/>Aquinas's description of natural law as the participation of human beings <lb/>in the eternal law, or perhaps vice versa. 35 This difference between <lb/>Blackstone and Aquinas becomes yet clearer in the former's comparison <lb/>of divine law with natural law. <lb/>Although human reason before the Fall sufficed to discover the <lb/>precepts of the law of nature, human reason after the Fall "is corrupt, and <lb/>[human] understanding full of ignorance and error." 36 Therefore, God of <lb/>his compassion has informed us of the law of nature "by . . . immediate <lb/>and direct revelation." 37 "The doctrines thus delivered we call the <lb/>revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy <lb/>scriptures." 38 So the natural law and the divine law both bespeak the law <lb/>of nature. <lb/>Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of <lb/>infinite more authority than what we generally call the natural <lb/>law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to <lb/>be by God himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of <lb/>human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as <lb/></body>

RICE, 50 QUESTIONS <lb/>ON THE NATURAL LAW 159-63 (1993) and Russell Hittinger, Natural Law and Catholic Moral <lb/>Philosophy, in A PRESERVING GRACE 1, 7-8 (Michael Cromartie ed., 1997). Hittinger finds <lb/>that Aquinas, "[i]n his last recorded remarks on the subject of natural law," said: <lb/>Now although God in creating man gave him this law of nature, <lb/>the devil oversowed another law in man, namely, the law of <lb/>concupiscence. . . . Since then the law of nature was destroyed by <lb/>concupiscence, man needed to be brought back to works of virtue, and <lb/>to be drawn away from vice: for which purpose he needed the written <lb/>law. <lb/>Id. at 7 (citing Thomas Aquinas, Collations in Decem Praeceptis (1273)). <lb/>1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 42. <lb/>Id. In tension with his formulation here, elsewhere in the Commentaries Blackstone will <lb/>write of "divine law, either natural or revealed," 2 id. at 420, and "divine law both natural <lb/>and revealed," id. at 455. In these two instances, it appears that he uses "divine" to denote <lb/>the divine origin of the law of nature rather than to denote divine law proper. So, in yet <lb/>a third place, he writes of "those laws which the creator has given us; the divine laws, I <lb/>mean, of either nature or revelation." 4 id. at 177. <lb/></listBibl>

            <body>certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an <lb/>equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any <lb/>competition together. 39 <lb/>Natural law is "only what . . . we imagine to be" the law of nature. 40 <lb/>The Commentaries continues with further observations on the <lb/>relationship between these laws and human law: <lb/>UPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of <lb/>revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human <lb/>laws should be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a <lb/>great number of indifferent points, in which both the divine law <lb/>and the natural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are <lb/>found necessary for the benefit of society to be restrained <lb/>within certain limits. And herein it is that human laws have <lb/>their greatest force and efficacy; for, with regard to such points <lb/>as are not indifferent, human laws are only declaratory of, and <lb/>act in subordination to, the former. 41 <lb/>Two elements of this excerpt warrant special notice. First is Blackstone's <lb/>usage of the "law of nature" and the "natural law." As mentioned <lb/>above, 42 his usage sometimes seems to depart from distinguishing the <lb/>two, with natural law as a merely human construct thought to resemble <lb/>the actual law of nature. On one reading, such a departure appears in this <lb/>passage. <lb/>The second element is the connection between matters <lb/>indifferent -matters for which the law of nature does not prescribe a <lb/>specific rule -and human law. While there is a firm link between the <lb/>laws of nature and human law, it appears that human law largely <lb/></body>

Examples of Blackstone's references to the divine law include his discussion of the law <lb/>of nuisance as enforcing "that excellent rule of gospel-morality, of 'doing to others as we <lb/>would they should do unto ourselves,'" 3 id. at 218, and of the criminal law, 4 id. at 11, 30, <lb/>42, 43, 60, including laws against homicide, id. at 177, dueling, id. at 199, and sodomy, <lb/>id. at 216. John Finnis has noted that Blackstone's endorsement of the role divine law is <lb/>to play in the formulation of human law does not lead him to confuse crime with sin.

			<body>concerns itself with matters indifferent. Whereas Aquinas casts human <lb/>law essentially in the position of providing determinations that apply <lb/>rules of the natural law in particular contexts, 43 Blackstone sees human <lb/>law having greatest play where the law of nature appears mute. This <lb/>significant role in his analysis for things indifferent owes a major debt to <lb/>Blackstone's Anglican point of view. 44 <lb/>Blackstone's introductory remarks on law and their relation to the <lb/>rest of the Commentaries (and, for that matter, Blackstone's entire <lb/>project) have drawn sharp criticism. It is reported that no less an <lb/>authority than Dr. Johnson remarked that Blackstone "thought clearly, <lb/>but he thought faintly." 45 The Commentaries "is widely believed to rest on <lb/>silly, ponderous, formal, conceptual, outdated, deductive, mechanistic, <lb/>naive and hopelessly unrealistic jurisprudence," 46 to be lacking in rigor, 47 <lb/>and apparently riven by inconsistencies. 48 Especially for his effort to <lb/>satisfy the customary requirement of supplying his treatise with a general <lb/>introduction on the law, 49 Blackstone has received much criticism. 50 <lb/>Beyond this, Blackstone seems largely to ignore the introductory doctrine <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 209-10 (I-II, 91, 3, observing that, "it is from the precepts <lb/>of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the human reason <lb/>needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular <lb/>determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws . . ."). The Commentaries <lb/>is not wholly lacking this approach. For example: "And sometimes, where the thing itself <lb/>has it's [sic] rise from the law of nature, the particular circumstances and mode of doing <lb/>it become right or wrong, as the laws of the land shall direct." 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note <lb/>23, at 55. <lb/>The significant role in the Commentaries for human law to supply rules for matters <lb/>indifferent does not preclude a role for the law of nature (or natural law) in supplying <lb/>specific rules for human law.

			<body>a use of the natural law that Blackstone's own introduction may not have <lb/>foretold for his readers today. <lb/>3. BLACKSTONE AND JUSTINIAN <lb/>Before seeing Blackstone as an Anglican it helps to see him as a civilian -<lb/>a master of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman law assembled <lb/>under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early sixth century. 55 <lb/>Blackstone's own studies at Oxford made him well acquainted with <lb/>Roman law. 56 This acquaintance primed him for cultivating his Anglican <lb/>approach to the natural law, an approach that ends up looking very much <lb/>like that of Justinian. <lb/>As noted already, the Commentaries presents the laws of England <lb/>primarily as a body of substantive law. 57 <lb/>This approach enabled <lb/>Blackstone to present the laws as a system, arranging them conceptually <lb/>by categories. 58 In this, the Commentaries resembles the Roman law <lb/>treatises of the ancient jurisconsult Gaius and of Justinian, whose <lb/>Institutes is a component of the Corpus Juris Civilis. 59 The Commentaries has <lb/>been likened to Justinian's work in both content and effect. 60 <lb/></body>

			<body>Like the Commentaries, the Corpus Juris Civilis presents abstract <lb/>introductory discussions of natural law 61 and manifests its actual use of <lb/>natural law in the body of the work, the treatment of the law of Rome. <lb/>Drawing on the universal and supreme authority of natural law, Justinian <lb/>used it to support and explain Roman law. Intent on promulgating law for <lb/>the entire Roman world, Justinian hoped to justify Roman law as <lb/>universal by demonstrating that it reflected universal principles of law. Of <lb/>course, the Emperor looked to support his own legal regime, not to supply <lb/>arguments to criticize or attack it. The dignity and universal authority of <lb/>the natural law lay ready to lend dignity and universal authority to Roman <lb/>law. 62 <lb/>Beyond lending this support, the natural law helped explain the <lb/>rules of Roman law. Natural and Roman law were viewed as intertwined, <lb/>so much so that natural law was best seen through existing Roman law, <lb/>the celebrated simplicity and harmony of which derived from this <lb/>relationship. 63 As in classical Greek thought on natural law, natural law <lb/>was understood to be from the "aboriginal design of nature," but Roman <lb/>thinking also understood actual, positive Roman law to approximate the <lb/>ideal natural law, gradually conforming to it more fully. 64 Far from a <lb/>revolutionary doctrine, the Roman natural law approach encouraged <lb/>Roman lawyers to find the natural law in positive law. 65 <lb/>In actual operation, Roman natural law concerned itself with <lb/>conforming legal rules to the nature of things. 66 It sought the intrinsic <lb/>character of legal subjects, applying natural reason to the facts of the <lb/></body>

			<body>matter at hand. 67 A master of both natural law theory and Roman law <lb/>likens this work to developing rules for preparing flaky piecrust. 68 <lb/>The Commentaries makes use of natural law in much the same <lb/>way. 69 Far from using natural law to trump the law of England, 70 and only <lb/>rarely using natural law to criticize English law, 71 Blackstone follows the <lb/>Roman natural law tradition in explaining why English law is as it is. 72 <lb/>This use is in keeping with Blackstone's practical rather than theoretical <lb/>bent. 73 Like the natural law of the Roman lawyer, 74 Blackstone's natural <lb/>law unites is with ought, seeking norms from the nature of things, 75 but <lb/>with more warrant. 76 <lb/>A good example of this technique is offered by Blackstone's <lb/>explanation of the law of property. As Professor Graham has explained, <lb/>the Commentaries does not present irrational support of old ways but <lb/>rather a studied focus on the physical nature of things. 77 From nature and <lb/>the natural order in physical context, for example, Blackstone evolves a <lb/>"natural history" of property to rationalize English property law. 78 . <lb/>Natural law inheres in the nature of things, and the law of England, like <lb/></body>

McKnight, supra note 2, at 403 n.33. At <lb/>least one commentator has written that the common-law tradition reflects the notion that <lb/>innate reason has led the positive law to hold within itself the natural law. Lobban, supra <lb/>note 50, at 314. Similar to this link is the one Blackstone approvingly found to be advanced <lb/>by Aristotle: learning positive law is a good way to learn ethics.

			<body>The Commentaries holds many instances where Blackstone <lb/>explicitly explains that English law is true to the nature of things -<lb/>sometimes presented as fulfilling the obligation of the law to reflect <lb/>"necessity." This, after he notes that the law of nature inheres in the <lb/>nature of things, 80 and that sound Roman laws took "the nature of things <lb/>for their guide." 81 Some examples: Blackstone establishes the obligation <lb/>of allegiance to civil government upon the nature of civil government. 82 <lb/>The legal relationship between husband and wife is founded in nature. 83 <lb/>Necessity has given rise to the law of property, 84 and laws on personal <lb/>property take into account their transitory nature. 85 The laws of civil <lb/>wrongs derive in several respects from the nature of things, often human <lb/>nature, 86 and criminal laws likewise derive from the nature of things or <lb/>reflect the nature of things. 87 In these instances, Blackstone seems to <lb/>hark back to the Roman law, rooted as it was in the nature of things. <lb/>Roman law makes its appearance in the Commentaries in at least <lb/>two other general ways that support Blackstone's Anglican approach to <lb/>the law. First is its concept of the jus gentium, the law of nations. If the <lb/>natural law truly is universal, one would expect it -or projections from it <lb/>-to be found in the laws of all nations. The law of nations, understood as <lb/>the body of laws to be found widespread among the nations of the earth, <lb/>therefore becomes a window on natural law, as the Romans believed. 88 <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>The Commentaries suggests that natural law inheres in the nature of things in such <lb/>language as, "when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter out <lb/>of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from which it can never <lb/>depart, and without which it would cease to be." 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 38. If <lb/>Blackstone tags the law of property as governing things indifferent, see infra note 152 and <lb/>accompanying text, he does not thereby hold that property law is wholly without natural <lb/>law principles. See infra notes 309-12 and accompanying text. <lb/>See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 40. <lb/>81 See id. at 58. <lb/>Id. at 354, 358. <lb/>See id. at 410. <lb/>See 2 id. at 4, 7. <lb/>See 3 id. at 146. <lb/>See id. at 4, 22, 116, 379, 434. <lb/>See 4 id. at 20-21, 27, 74, 186, 216. <lb/>See D'ENTRÈVES, supra note 61, at 32-33; MAINE, supra note 24, at 46; NICHOLAS, supra note <lb/>66, at 55. <lb/></listBibl>

			<body>This value of the jus gentium is evident in Blackstone's use of <lb/>comparative law. He looks to law outside England not so much to <lb/>disparage non-English law as to find points of commonality. Those <lb/>points support English law by suggesting that it rests upon natural law <lb/>foundations. 89 A similar cast in Anglican theology could therefore offer a <lb/>link and support to Blackstone's approach to the law. <lb/>Beyond its content, another aspect of Roman law that influenced <lb/>the Commentaries and would harmonize well with an Anglican <lb/>understanding of the law is the process of the development of Roman law. <lb/>Roman law developed over hundreds of years, largely case by case. 90 In <lb/>this respect, its development paralleled that of English common law. <lb/>While Roman law came to repose nearly exclusively in the Corpus Juris <lb/>Civilis, 91 English law rejected such codification in favor of its commitment <lb/>to the method by which Roman law developed. 92 Some have noted that <lb/>Blackstone took the view of a practicing lawyer and judge in the <lb/>Commentaries, 93 and though it was famously said that, "In England less <lb/>attention is paid to natural law than anywhere else in the world," 94 <lb/>Blackstone used natural law arguments successfully at the bar. 95 The <lb/>common law -the law of cases -required barristers and judges to <lb/>consider cases with an eye to their context. This technique largely <lb/>provided the materials Blackstone assembled in the Commentaries. It is a <lb/>technique that befits the Anglican way, a technique that developed law <lb/>that itself befits the Anglican way. It also was the way of Roman lawyers. <lb/></body>

			<body>If common law judges in deciding cases were making law up, they were <lb/>making it up to fit. 96 <lb/>Blackstone, student of Roman law, reflected a Roman law approach <lb/>to the natural law in the Commentaries. Beginning, like the Digest and <lb/>Institutes of the Corpus Juris Civilis, with an abstract exposition of natural <lb/>law and related formulations, the body of the Commentaries puts natural <lb/>law most to use in explaining and justifying particular rules of law. <lb/>Seeking the dictates of reason and the guide of reasonableness, <lb/>Blackstone rests rules of law upon the nature of the matter at hand -a <lb/>typically Roman technique. In this and other respects, Blackstone's use of <lb/>natural law fits well with the Anglican stance on natural law that he <lb/>adopts in the Commentaries. <lb/>4. BLACKSTONE AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND <lb/>No surprise that Sir William Blackstone, Oxford don, justice of both the <lb/>King's Bench and Common Pleas, was an Anglican. What may surprise is <lb/>how serious an Anglican Blackstone was, and how deeply his Anglicanism <lb/>influenced the jurisprudence of his Commentaries. <lb/>Blackstone's deep and pervasive Christian faith was manifest. 97 As <lb/>a young man he took a serious interest in religion, 98 and made a careful <lb/>investigation <lb/>of <lb/>Anglicanism 99 <lb/>before <lb/>committing <lb/>himself <lb/>wholeheartedly to orthodox Anglicanism. 100 <lb/>He celebrated his <lb/>commitment in a poem, a vision of diverse faiths in which he praised the <lb/>Church of England for its moderation, liberty, support of science, <lb/></body>

			<body>reforming influence, and virtue. 101 Although a committed Anglican, <lb/>Blackstone was not so committed that he could brook no Dissenters, 102 <lb/>going so far as to alter the Commentaries in light of Dissenter reaction to <lb/>an earlier edition of the work. 103 The general Anglican understanding of <lb/>providential development from primitive sources 104 and the important <lb/>role reason plays in perceiving truth 105 would support Blackstone's <lb/>construction of the Commentaries. <lb/>The substantial alignments between Anglican theology and the <lb/>Commentaries are the focus of the next pages of this article. <lb/>4.1. RICHARD HOOKER <lb/>Key to the Church of England is the work of the Elizabethan divine, <lb/>Richard Hooker. 106 Beyond helping to shape the contours of Anglicanism <lb/>as a whole, Hooker's influence on legal theory was especially <lb/>pronounced. 107 <lb/>Blackstone's Anglican understanding of the law <lb/>necessarily reflects Hooker's understanding. <lb/>Hooker held law in high esteem: <lb/>[O]f Law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is <lb/>the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world: all things <lb/>in heaven and in earth do her homage, the very least as feeling <lb/>her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both <lb/>Angels and men and creatures of what condition soever, though <lb/></body>

			<body>each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, <lb/>admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy. 108 <lb/>Law for Hooker is fundamental. 109 Furthermore, his treatment of law is <lb/>no incidental matter but derives from his theology. 110 Law, as one might <lb/>gather from the excerpt just quoted, reigns over politics. In this, Hooker <lb/>departs from an Aristotelian view, 111 and follows, as elsewhere, the <lb/>magisterial reformers rather than Augustine or Aquinas. 112 <lb/>Hooker goes so far as to hold that God himself works according to <lb/>law, 113 and for at least one commentator, Hooker holds that God is law. 114 A <lb/>famous apothegm of Hooker states that "the being of God is a kind of law <lb/>to his working." 115 <lb/>In some respects, Hooker's general discussion of the fundamental <lb/>types of law adumbrates that of Blackstone. Hooker explains that, in his <lb/>usage, both the law of nature and divine law reveal eternal law to <lb/>humankind. 116 At the same time, however, Hooker holds divine law to be <lb/>positive law, a creature of God's reason and will both, whereas for <lb/>Blackstone it is simply a revelation of the law of nature. 117 Likewise, <lb/>Hooker sees some human law as an adaptation of natural law, and other <lb/>human law as an ordinance "merely human," reasonable and convenient <lb/></body>

			<body>for the time and place. 118 A similar formulation of human law will find its <lb/>way into the Commentaries. 119 <lb/>The line from Hooker to Blackstone is more clearly traced along <lb/>particular elements to be found in the works of both. One is the role of <lb/>human reason in the development of law. 120 Like other Reformation <lb/>theologians, Hooker asserts that Scripture and reason both convey to <lb/>humans the knowledge of God and of his eternal law. 121 "It was part of <lb/>God's nature to work in an orderly and reasonable way . . . ." 122 <lb/>Consequently, "God's own creation also worked in an orderly and <lb/>reasonable way," 123 a way ruled by law. God acts to accomplish his <lb/>"rational purpose." 124 So for Hooker, the appeal to reason becomes <lb/>key. 125 The law of reason is for all humans, 126 endowed as they are with "a <lb/>natural practical wisdom." 127 Humans find themselves ruled by the law of <lb/>reason, divine law, and human law 128 -the last resting upon rational <lb/>human nature 129 and either resolving "probable matters" or "clarify[ing] <lb/></body>

			<body>and enforc[ing] the necessary precepts of reason." 130 The authority <lb/>Hooker grants to human reason, a touchstone of Anglicanism, holds sway <lb/>in the Commentaries, as shall appear. 131 <lb/>A second major influence of Hooker upon Blackstone is his <lb/>endorsement of the authority of custom. Against the Puritan threat of <lb/>"singularity," lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a <lb/>distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately <lb/>by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce <lb/>obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker's view <lb/>that God teaches through human experience. 136 <lb/>It also supports <lb/>Blackstone's hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him <lb/>to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional <lb/>developments. 137 <lb/>Third is the related matter of Hooker's use of history. For Hooker, <lb/>Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that <lb/>God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker's position <lb/>that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may <lb/>make laws, but in a sense those laws are God's as he works his providential <lb/>will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative <lb/>for Hooker. 143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to <lb/>English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as <lb/></body>

			<body>an emphasis on historical continuity. 145 For Blackstone, history is the key <lb/>to understanding English law. 146 <lb/>The last marked influence of Hooker on Blackstone is the <lb/>importance of the concept of things indifferent, matters not conclusively <lb/>ordained by transcendent law but rather left more to human <lb/>determination. 147 Positive laws may resolve matters that God leaves to <lb/>human liberty. 148 So, while some human laws are based upon natural <lb/>law, 149 its necessary tenets are few, leaving most matters to public <lb/>authority. 150 Blackstone takes a similar tack 151 : Daniel Boorstin has <lb/>discussed the remarkable degree to which Blackstone holds that private <lb/>property itself is a creature of civil law. 152 Crimes not mala in se but rather <lb/>those "with regard to things in themselves indifferent . . . become either <lb/>right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or misdemeanors, according as the <lb/>municipal legislator sees proper." 153 "Lands are not naturally descendible <lb/>any more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit <lb/>and peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as well <lb/></body>

See <lb/>D. SEABORN DAVIES, THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH LAW 20 (1954). As to one such instance, it is <lb/>both intriguing and relevant to note that Blackstone observes that blood guilt-a concept <lb/>harking back to biblical standards-would adhere to Parliament were it to over-extend <lb/>capital punishment. 4 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 11.

THE LATITUDINARIANS <lb/>The Anglican Church faced the Age of Reason and Deism with <lb/>Latitudinarianism. 166 <lb/>Though standing in opposition to those two <lb/>developments, the Latitudinarians, as their name implies, embraced <lb/>tolerance as their major theme. 167 This theme in no way compromised <lb/>their commitment to God and the Christian faith. The Latitudinarians <lb/>believed that God holds an absolute claim on humanity and that all our <lb/>powers depend upon his will. 168 Christianity is to govern all of life. 169 <lb/>Education for moral and spiritual reformation is especially important. 170 <lb/>With these tenets Latitudinarianism was a major force in seventeenth <lb/>century Anglicanism. <lb/>It also was in important respects a movement in continuity with <lb/>the work of Hooker, a continuity that would support the work of <lb/>Blackstone. The Latitudinarians in their tolerance relied upon Hooker's <lb/>emphasis on things indifferent. 171 <lb/>They also shared Hooker's <lb/>endorsement of strong laws. 172 <lb/>Beyond these particulars, the most important influence of <lb/>Latitudinarianism to be seen in the Commentaries, and well within the <lb/>trajectory Hooker set for the Anglican Church, was its appreciation for <lb/>reason as a guide in human affairs.

The first is emphasis on experience.

REV. 703, 703 (1942) (reviewing The Mysterious <lb/>Science of the Law: An Essay on Blackstone's Commentaries (1941)). <lb/>See PREST, supra note 1, at 308; Graham, supra note 77, at 152; Tim Stretton, Coverture and <lb/>Unity of Person in Blackstone's Commentaries, in BLACKSTONE AND HIS COMMENTARIES, supra <lb/>note 14, at 111, 125. <lb/>See BUTLER, supra note 188, at 162. <lb/>See MOSSNER, supra note 167, at 189. <lb/>See Conklin, supra note 23, at 213-15. Conklin points out especially the affinity in <lb/>epistemology and the role of happiness. <lb/>See Blackstone's probabilism here, for example: "But this [move of the Restoration <lb/>Parliament] was for the necessity of the thing, which supersedes all law; for if they had <lb/>not so met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace." <lb/>1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 147 (emphasis added). And here: "So that it is morally <lb/>impossible to trace out, with any degree of accuracy, when the several mutations of the <lb/>common law were made . . . ." 4 id. at 402 (first emphasis added). The probabilism in <lb/>this use of "morally impossible" finds an explanation from Blackstone's contemporary, <lb/>Samuel Johnson: <lb/>He thus defined the difference between physical and moral truth: <lb/>"Physical truth is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth <lb/>is, when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appears to you. <lb/>I say such a one walked across the street; if he really did so, I told a <lb/>physical truth. If I thought so, though I should have been mistaken, I <lb/>told a moral truth." <lb/>JAMES BOSWELL, THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON 510-11 (C.P. Chadsey ed., Doubleday 1946) <lb/>(1791). <lb/></listBibl>

			<body>reasonableness as a touchstone of truth, 210 and common sense coupled <lb/>with experience. 211 The large role in the Commentaries played by history <lb/>may be ascribed, at least in part, to this regard for experience. 212 <lb/>A second aspect of Butler's theology that helped shape the <lb/>Commentaries is the importance and function of human happiness. 213 God <lb/>governs mankind by reward, by the consequences of human actions. 214 <lb/>Therefore, true happiness directs us towards doing God's will. 215 This <lb/>happiness (supplemented by conscience 216 ) defies certain demonstration, <lb/>but does make itself known with "practical proof." 217 To pursue virtue is <lb/>to pursue happiness, and to pursue happiness is to pursue virtue. 218 <lb/>Again, Blackstone concurs with Butler in his argument that God has <lb/>ordered human affairs so that we need only pursue our own happiness to <lb/>find ourselves pursuing the law of nature that God has established for the <lb/>right ordering of our affairs. 219 For both Butler and Blackstone, reasonable <lb/>self-love motivates us to adhere to God's rule. 220 So here too, Blackstone <lb/>shows himself in the Commentaries aligning with the work of Butler as he <lb/>aligns with other elements of the Anglican tradition. <lb/>Blackstone had every reason to write the Commentaries from an <lb/>Anglican point of view. It was good rhetoric for reaching his intended <lb/></body>

			<body>audience. It was true to his own convictions. We have seen thus far <lb/>particular elements of the Commentaries signaling Blackstone's Anglican <lb/>approach. The main topic of this article, however, is his use of natural <lb/>law-the concept and body of transcendent law-and the degree to which <lb/>Blackstone's Anglican understanding shapes this use. <lb/>5. THE ANGLICAN BLACKSTONE AND THE NATURAL LAW <lb/>As we have seen, Blackstone's Commentaries bears the impress of its <lb/>author's Anglican faith. This impress shapes the appearance of natural <lb/>law in the Commentaries, but by no means minimizes the role of natural <lb/>law. To be sure, if using natural law means using it as Aquinas used it, <lb/>Blackstone does not use natural law. 221 In fact, Anglican Blackstone <lb/>lodges criticism at the scholastic tradition. 222 But the use of natural law, a <lb/>transcendent norm that guides human law, may transcend Aquinas's use. <lb/>In fact, the Commentaries more than anything takes the common law back <lb/>to natural law, to first principles, 223 portraying the common law as <lb/>blended with the natural law into one body. 224 Its use of natural law is not <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>While Blackstone does subscribe to the notion that natural law bounds the validity of <lb/>human law, see supra text accompanying notes 32, 41; Posner, supra note 45, at 605, his <lb/>use of natural law embraces far more, Finnis, supra note 24, at 183. <lb/>See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 78; see also 2 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 58 (describing <lb/>the "ingenuity" of the middle ages as one "which perplexed all theology with the subtilty <lb/>of scholastic disquisitions, and bewildered philosophy in the mazes of metaphysical <lb/>jargon"); 4 id. at 410-11 (bemoaning the scholastic intricacies of Norman jurisprudence). <lb/>Blackstone's approach avoided the complexities of the scholastics. See Conklin, supra <lb/>note 23, at 224. At the same time, while some note Blackstone's modern emphasis on <lb/>individual rights rather than on the classic common good, Finnis, supra note 24, at 181, <lb/>and on peace as the end of civil society, BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 179, and his "social" <lb/>rather than philosophical consistency, Brinton, supra note 204, at 704, Blackstone does <lb/>hold that society has a "moral purpose," BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 190, and shares also <lb/>with Aquinas, see, e.g., 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 213-14 (I-II, 92, 1), 232-33 (I-II, 96, <lb/>3), the belief that law has moral content, teaches right and wrong, and improves human <lb/>beings. See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 27, 45; 2 id. at 8; 3 id. at 162. <lb/>See Conklin, supra note 23, at 211. <lb/>224 Cf. Helmholz, supra note 55, at 21-22 (noting that English lawyers traditionally assumed <lb/>that the common law and natural law "complemented each other").

As the <lb/>spirit of law is a product of natural law, 236 so natural law can be seen from <lb/>the laws of England. 237 At the same time, English common law contained <lb/>a strong cultural component, 238 adapted as it was "to the genius of the <lb/></body>

			<body>English nation." 239 Taking liberty as the signal English virtue led, as we <lb/>shall see, only to emphasizing all the more the importance of natural law <lb/>to the laws of England. 240 <lb/>The Anglican context lent Blackstone's natural law an empirical <lb/>cast akin to Sir Isaac Newton's physics. 241 His approach was descriptive, <lb/>not deductive. 242 Blackstone was not unaware of the dangers of arguing <lb/>from particular to general, 243 but he nonetheless endorsed the scientific <lb/>approach. 244 The Commentaries is a quest for reasonableness, for the <lb/>rational principles -the natural law -undergirding the positive <lb/>particulars of English common law. 245 Because law is a rational science, <lb/>natural law suffuses the text. 246 In this commitment to empirical science <lb/>for fleshing out the natural law embedded in English law, Blackstone <lb/>treats law much as Butler treated theology. <lb/>Hooker more than Butler animates Blackstone's emphasis on <lb/>history, but that emphasis likewise demonstrates an Anglican approach to <lb/>natural law. 247 It is in progressive human experience that Providence <lb/>gradually works the natural law into human law. 248 As with Burke's view, <lb/>natural law makes itself known in history. 249 But history is no sure <lb/></body>

			<body>guarantee that the human law has taken on its shape from natural law. <lb/>Blackstone held that awkward complexity too comes from history, 250 and <lb/>history must bow to reason if found to contradict it. 251 Nevertheless, <lb/>Blackstone held history both descriptive of the law and prescriptive, 252 <lb/>obviating the need to distinguish "historical explanation" from "moral <lb/>justification." 253 The providential, historical development of the law <lb/>enabled Blackstone to portray law as possessing both the appropriate <lb/>degree of fixity and the appropriate degree of change. On the one hand, <lb/>common law and justice itself are fixed and uniform. 254 On the other <lb/>hand, natural law leads to growth and change in the law, 255 and it is <lb/>susceptible of diverse interpretations. 256 <lb/>Far from his being an <lb/>uncompromising apologist for the status quo, 257 Blackstone's very <lb/>commitment to history also committed him to progress. 258 Correction <lb/>and improvement -in continuity with historical development -are <lb/>welcome. 259 Accordingly, the Commentaries ends with this charge: <lb/>We have taken occasion to admire at every turn the noble <lb/>monuments of antient simplicity, and the more curious <lb/>refinements of modern art. Nor have it's [sic; i.e., that of the <lb/>body of English law] faults been concealed from view; for faults <lb/></body>

Boorstin writes that Blackstone employs a fiction that <lb/>English law expresses both "the perfection of reason" and "the fullness of experience," <lb/>BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 135, but Blackstone asserts that legal customs, while often <lb/>rooted in natural law, are not always reasonable and so may stand in need of correction. <lb/>Compare, e.g., 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 251 (suggesting that a custom "seems <lb/>dictated by nature herself") with id. at 280 (observing how an ancient rule of common law <lb/>"was consonant neither to reason nor humanity" and so endorsing its later alteration). <lb/>See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 63. <lb/>LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 49.

			<body>it has, lest we should be tempted to think it of more than <lb/>human structure: defects, chiefly arising from the decays of <lb/>time, or the rage of unskilful [sic] improvements in later ages. <lb/>To sustain, to repair, to beautify this noble pile, is a charge <lb/>intrusted principally to the nobility, and such gentlemen of the <lb/>kingdom, as are delegated by their country to parliament. The <lb/>protection of THE LIBERTY OF BRITAIN is a duty which they <lb/>owe to themselves, who enjoy it; to their ancestors, who <lb/>transmitted it down; and to their posterity, who will claim at <lb/>their hands this, the best birthright, and noblest inheritance of <lb/>mankind. 260 <lb/>As the common law embodies and expresses the natural law, it is to be <lb/>reformed when lapses from that transcendent standard appear. <lb/>Blackstone calls English law of "human structure." <lb/>Though <lb/>eighteenth-century English lawyers may have called their law "the <lb/>perfection of reason," 261 Blackstone acknowledges it to be a somewhat <lb/>faulty human application of natural law, 262 sometimes more honored in <lb/>the breach. 263 <lb/>One means of developing the law with both Anglican continuity <lb/>and an eye to the principles of natural law is by legal fiction. 264 <lb/>Blackstone held that legal fictions permit the law to do justice in changed <lb/>circumstances, 265 as in bypassing Norman errors. 266 <lb/>In the <lb/>Commentaries, fictions, along with history, ground the law. 267 Legal <lb/></body>

			<body>fictions enable the common law to embody the principles of the natural <lb/>law. 268 <lb/>Of course, statutes also might help the law embody the principles <lb/>of natural law. 269 To some degree, the Commentaries portrays statutes as <lb/>declaring the natural law, 270 lending necessary correction to the common <lb/>law while simultaneously rooted in the common law. 271 But statutes <lb/>present a danger: <lb/>THE mischiefs that have arisen to the public from <lb/>inconsiderate alterations in our laws, are too obvious to be <lb/>called in question; and how far they have been owing to the <lb/>defective education of our senators, is a point well worthy of <lb/>the public attention.

			<body>Blackstone to picture some statutes as monstrous add-ons. 277 But the <lb/>fault of such statutes is that they are in a sense ahistorical -they reflect <lb/>"visionary schemes" and "have not the foundation of the common law to <lb/>build on." 278 Statutes that bring the law closer to the natural law will find <lb/>their basis not in imagined exploits but rather in the principles already to <lb/>be found in the common law itself, the generally trustworthy, if <lb/>imperfect, presentation of the natural law. <lb/>Blackstone's commitment to the common law as holding within it <lb/>immanent natural law reflects both the Roman law and also the Roman <lb/>notion that the jus gentium, the law of nations, is a sound guide to the <lb/>content of the natural law. 279 While the common law may embody the <lb/>natural law more perfectly than do other systems of human law, those <lb/>other systems may shed light on the natural law to be found within the <lb/>common law. Blackstone subscribed to the uniformity of human nature <lb/>and God's purpose, to the consequent uniformity of natural law, and to <lb/>the expectation that the laws of all nations, past and present, would <lb/>reflect these truths. 280 Comparative law illuminates the universality of <lb/>English legal principles, the deposit of natural law. 281 The Age of Reason <lb/>looked for the natural law in the jus gentium, 282 and the Commentaries <lb/>looks to other legal systems to help find reason in the English law. 283 In <lb/>the spirit of Hooker, Blackstone found natural law principles behind the <lb/>diversity of laws even on aspects indifferent under the natural law. And in <lb/>the spirit of Butler, he found marks of reasonableness in the similarity of <lb/>English law to the law of other nations. <lb/>(The dominant role of <lb/>reasonableness in the Commentaries occupies our attention soon.) <lb/></body>

			<body>The Bible itself often found its way into the Commentaries under the <lb/>aspect of comparative law -again, this was similar to the approach of <lb/>Hooker. 284 Blackstone kept the Bible close to him while writing the <lb/>Commentaries, 285 and he considered the divine law to be found therein the <lb/>authoritative source on what he called the "law of nature" 286 and on the <lb/>development of legal rules and doctrine. 287 Most typically, however, he <lb/>used the Bible as a source of comparative law, a source presenting a body <lb/>of law perfectly devised to embrace the natural law for a specific people at <lb/>a specific time. 288 Natural law then was to be found within biblical law <lb/>and not to be identified with it in its particulars. 289 <lb/>In these diverse ways -from finding natural law embedded within <lb/>the common law, to the use of science, history, and comparative law -<lb/>the Commentaries takes account of natural law in its treatment of English <lb/>law, all in keeping with an Anglican understanding of natural law and its <lb/>application to human affairs. But the most distinctively Anglican feature <lb/>of how the Commentaries treats the natural law has escaped for the most <lb/>part our attention until now. That feature is the testing and justification <lb/>of the law of England by its reasonableness. Hooker, and especially Butler <lb/>and the Latitudinarians, lent to Anglican theology its distinct emphasis <lb/>on reasonableness. It is in this aspect of his jurisprudence that Blackstone <lb/>most shows himself an Anglican. <lb/>For Blackstone, natural law does not dictate the content of most <lb/>human law. 290 It supplies a few core principles, and those few do not <lb/></body>

			<body>fundamentally overbear human law. 291 Furthermore, the state of civil <lb/>society itself modifies primordial natural law, introducing a context <lb/>where natural law principles take on a different cast or a subservient <lb/>role. 292 For Blackstone, the application of natural law is not so much a <lb/>matter of tracing specific precepts in human law. Rather, it is more like <lb/>the practice of Roman lawyers, finding reasonable and appropriate legal <lb/>norms suited to the situation at hand -the nature of the thing. The <lb/>Commentaries presents the common law as a "rational, integrated" <lb/>system, but also consistently traces its reasonableness, the reasons <lb/>behind its details. 293 <lb/>The quest for life in accordance with nature, and therefore with <lb/>reason, was a mark of the Age of Reason. 294 But Blackstone sought <lb/>reasons for the law as a mark of God's own perfection, to be discerned <lb/>through human experience. 295 <lb/>Blackstone derived his passion for <lb/>"reasonableness" in the law, and the consequent searching out of reasons <lb/>for the law, from his Anglican theology. 296 <lb/>The very core of the <lb/>Commentaries is this essential use of natural law, this examination of <lb/>reasonableness in light of the way things are. Reasons for the law, reasons <lb/>resting upon on fundamental principles, animate the Commentaries. 297 <lb/></body>

			<body>Throughout the Commentaries, Blackstone weighs law against the standard <lb/>of reasonableness. 298 The weighing is not rigorous. Fallen humans cannot <lb/>understand all by reason, and the reason for some law may now evade our <lb/>discovery. 299 It is enough that the law not be contrary to reason: 300 <lb/>[W]hat is not reason is not law. Not that the particular reason <lb/>of every rule in the law can at this distance of time be always <lb/>precisely assigned; but it is sufficient that there be nothing in <lb/>the rule flatly contradictory to reason, and then the law will <lb/>presume it to be well founded. 301 <lb/>Most often, however, the Commentaries highlights the place of reason in <lb/>the formulation of the law and supports the reasonableness of its rules. 302 <lb/>Furthermore, the Commentaries endorses reasonableness in interpreting <lb/>laws according to their equity, reason, and justice. 303 This overall <lb/>emphasis on reasonableness in the law, seeking sound reasons for rules <lb/>and for their proper application, largely shapes the Commentaries. 304 <lb/>Blackstone thought human law most significant on matters <lb/>indifferent, taking full advantage of the Anglican tradition regarding such <lb/>matters, an essential contribution of Hooker. 305 But though "indifferent" <lb/>may describe a matter not dictated by a precept of natural law, it does not <lb/>describe a matter to be determined by human will undirected by reason. <lb/>Support for this proposition derives from Blackstone's theory of natural <lb/>rights.

			<body>liberty as a mark of English culture. 306 Liberty -personal freedom -is <lb/>so important that only reasonable constraint upon it is licit. 307 "[L]aws <lb/>themselves, whether made with or without our consent, if they regulate <lb/>and constrain our conduct in matters of mere indifference, without any <lb/>good end in view, are laws destructive of our liberty." 308 Rights therefore <lb/>play a fundamental role in the Commentaries, and help support the natural <lb/>law test of reason even in matters indifferent according to the more <lb/>limited reach of explicit natural law precepts. <lb/>And Blackstone does make much of the notion of matters <lb/>indifferent, a mark of Hooker's theology and the Anglican tradition. 309 <lb/>His frequent use of the test of reasonableness supplies a natural law <lb/>standard in the absence of precise precepts themselves drawn from <lb/>nature. 310 In a sense then, the Commentaries presents most human law as <lb/>prescribing rules for matters indifferent. 311 In another sense, however, <lb/>Blackstone's insistence upon the reasonableness of human law supplies a <lb/>standard and justification much like that of the Roman law, a standard <lb/>and justification from natural law assuring that human law is suited to <lb/>the reality of things. 312 <lb/>The reality of things can become clouded by human artifice, so the <lb/>primitive state -and primitive law -offer a useful corrective. 313 For <lb/>Blackstone, Saxon law stood for law based upon reason, not authority, 314 <lb/></body>

			<body>he himself esteeming primitive law the most rational and therefore most <lb/>true to nature. 315 The corruption of Saxon law by "Norman subtlety" 316 <lb/>left it an ideal to be recovered by progress under the hand of <lb/>Providence. 317 The law is to conform to reason, and Saxon law points the <lb/>way to reasonable law untainted by later human error. <lb/>Likewise, Blackstone's emphasis on the reasonableness of the law <lb/>helps make sense of his theory of judging. A judge is "sworn to determine, <lb/>not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known <lb/>laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but <lb/>to maintain and expound the old one." 318 This declaratory theory of <lb/>judging has come under wide-ranging attack, 319 and some doubt has been <lb/>cast on whether Blackstone himself really subscribed to it. 320 Though <lb/>judges even now may pay lip service to the theory, 321 it may seem unlikely <lb/>that the development of the common law and the decision of difficult <lb/>questions proceed simply from the declaration of pre-existing principles <lb/>and rules, and not from judicial invention. 322 But the matter might be less <lb/>puzzling if, rather than thinking that the theory entails some preexistent <lb/>code of natural-law rules ready to fill gaps in the previously declared <lb/></body>

MAINE, <lb/>supra note 24, at 60 (noting that Roman lawyers respected the natural law within their own <lb/>law for its "descent from the aboriginal reign of nature"). Presumably, Blackstone melds <lb/>his endorsement of both Saxon primitivism and historical development in the notion of <lb/>sound development upon Saxon principle. <lb/>1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 69; see also 3 id. at 327 ("For though in many other <lb/>countries every thing is left in the breast of the judge to determine, yet with us he is only <lb/>to declare and pronounce, not to make or new-model, the law"). This understanding of <lb/>the work of the judge is in keeping with Blackstone's view of the use of reason in law to <lb/>discover, not to invent. See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 51, 123.

			<body>common law, one could see instead that the question in any case is <lb/>governed either by principles marked in precedent or by whichever of the <lb/>rules proposed by the parties is the more reasonable in the light of <lb/>precedent and the facts of the instant case. 323 The judicial resolution of <lb/>otherwise uncertain questions of law demands the application of reason <lb/>and not ex post legislative will. <lb/>As we have seen, Blackstone does take natural law seriously, but in <lb/>an Anglican sense. The common law reflects the natural law, understood <lb/>as the rule of reasonableness, a norm that aligns the law with the realities <lb/>of the situation at hand, much as the Roman law is celebrated for doing so <lb/>well. That is the natural law as the Commentaries most often applies it. <lb/>6. CONCLUSION <lb/>After the spread of the Benthamite positivism, the sense of the <lb/>natural law enterprise was forgotten and (despite the eclipse of <lb/>Bentham's epistemology) it has remained usual to believe that <lb/>the heart of any theory of natural law is, not the problem of the <lb/>varying derivation of positive from natural law, but the thesis <lb/>that positive law is "for all purposes" void if it contradicts <lb/>natural law. Thus Blackstone's introductory discourse and <lb/>definition of municipal law have standardly been interpreted <lb/>on the assumption that any discussion of the relation between <lb/>natural and positive law must be headed for an assertion or <lb/>denial of that crude slogan, lex iniusta non est lex. 324 <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>323 Apparently, on the bench Blackstone himself adhered to the declaratory theory and <lb/>faithfully applied precedent.

That Blackstone does not subscribe to judicial review, see 1 <lb/>BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 91; Helmholz, supra note 55, at 14, in no way compromises <lb/>his commitment to natural law.

			<body>Readers of the Commentaries committed to a narrow understanding of <lb/>natural law -often so committed only to reject the concept of natural law <lb/>altogether -find Blackstone at best an epigone of natural law thinkers. <lb/>He pays his natural-law lip service and then goes about his merry (and <lb/>disguised) positivist way. 325 Ignoring the relation of law to morals as well <lb/>as historical normativity, 326 we lack eyes to see Blackstone's use of <lb/>natural law in explaining, justifying, and criticizing English law. <lb/>At the same time, how strange to think that human law somehow <lb/>exists apart from reasons for its existence, reasons that connect it to the <lb/>world it is to govern. Holmes supplies such reasons. 327 Posner supplies <lb/>such reasons. 328 Blackstone does too. His reasons, his general recursion <lb/>to reasonableness, is not simply a platitudinous reference. Within his <lb/>Anglican context, reason and reasonableness are notes of God's order and <lb/>providence. They are notes of natural law. <lb/>The concept of law without values is incoherent. The "reason" and <lb/>"reasonableness" peppering the Commentaries are meant to supply the <lb/>link between the laws of England and the values that developed and <lb/>undergird them. Blackstone's Anglican approach to systematizing and <lb/>explaining English law -the systematizing and explaining that made his <lb/>Commentaries such a success -renders this link a natural-law <lb/>enterprise. 329 And this enterprise should strike lawyers, and especially <lb/>law students, as something familiar. They may not share Blackstone's <lb/>theological commitments, but when they strive to make sense of the rules <lb/>of law, to see the rules as reasonable, to find reasons for the rules, they <lb/></body>
