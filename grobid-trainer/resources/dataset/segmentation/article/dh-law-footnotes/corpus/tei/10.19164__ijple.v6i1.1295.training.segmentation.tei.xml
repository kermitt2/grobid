			<front>55 <lb/>The Power of Teaching Police through the Prism of Human Rights 1 <lb/>Sean Molloy 2 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>As part of their training in England and Wales, police recruits are required to engage with a <lb/>complex mix of law, often with no prior background in legal education. In addition, they must <lb/>learn, understand, and apply the content of a highly descriptive national police curriculum <lb/>(NPC). The combination of these tasks, amongst other things, can limit the extent to which <lb/>police training can cultivate critical thinking, a central objective of efforts to professionalise the <lb/>police in recent times. In this article and based on the author&apos;s experience of teaching law to <lb/>police recruits, the challenges of the current approach to police training are explored through <lb/>Freire&apos;s pedagogy of the oppressed and what he terms the banking model of education. After <lb/>drawing connections between this model and the current approach to police training, a human <lb/>rights-based approach to police teaching is offered as an example of Freire&apos;s preferred problem-<lb/>solving method. Central to this model is utilising the views of recruits regarding the role of the <lb/>police in balancing rights to help understand the law as it exists. <lb/>Keywords: Police Pedagogy; Pedagogy of the Oppressed; College of Policing; Police <lb/>Education Qualification Framework; Stop and Search; Human Rights <lb/></front>

			<body>The training and education of police recruits in England and Wales was historically <lb/>&apos;provided through a patchwork of local provision, known as the Initial Police <lb/>Learning and Development Programme.&apos; 3 In 2011, the Home Secretary commissioned <lb/>Peter Neyroud, then Chief Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency, <lb/>to undertake a review of police leadership and training. During a subsequent Home <lb/>Affairs committee review, Neyroud stated the &apos;â€¦police service needs to move from <lb/>being a service that acts professionally to becoming a professional service.&apos; 4 Based on <lb/>his review, he outlined the principles of policing in the 21st Century as ensuring the <lb/>police are democratically accountable, legitimate, evidence-based, nationally (and <lb/>internationally) coherent, capable, competent, and cost-effective. 5 In 2016 and in <lb/>response, the UK College of Policing (CoP)-the professional body that oversees the <lb/>police in England and Wales-published the Police Education Qualification <lb/>Framework (PEQF), which provides a framework for degree-level entry qualifications <lb/>and sets out three entry routes for new probationer constables: 6 <lb/></body>

The pre-join degree in professional policing, introduced from 2020, where <lb/>prospective recruits acquire their degree in policing in advance of <lb/>recruitment; <lb/>3. The Degree Holder Entry Programme (DHEP), introduced from 2020, where <lb/>prospective recruits &apos;convert&apos; an existing degree level qualification into a <lb/>policing degree. <lb/>The Policing Vision 2025 defines the overall strategic purpose of the PEQF as <lb/>providing an improved service for the public. 7 This is namely, the &apos;translation and <lb/>application of the knowledge, skills, capabilities and approaches covered by the new <lb/>educational approach into effective professional performance will play an important <lb/>part in delivering what Policing Vision 2025 identifies as &apos;a more sophisticated <lb/>response to the challenges we face now and, in the future.&apos; 8 Central to the <lb/>professionalisation of the police and the PEQF are two aspects: collaborative teaching <lb/>partnerships between the police and universities and developing critical thinking. <lb/></body>

			<body>When the PEQF was introduced, one of the underlying drivers for the reform of the <lb/>police entry routes was to increase the professionalization of the police service in <lb/>England and Wales. 9 A central component of this professionalization drive was and <lb/>remains to harness and nurture the capacity for police officers to think independently <lb/>and critically. The salience attached to critical thinking is directly connected to the new <lb/>approach of collaborative teaching and, in particular, the inclusion of universities in <lb/>the delivery of police training. As McCanney, Taylor and Bates note, &apos;[i]t is claimed <lb/>that graduate entry will ensure that recruits possess critical thinking skills enabling <lb/>them to make autonomous decisions by assessing and balancing complex risks. 10 A <lb/>move intended to elevate policing to a profession.&apos; 11 This reflects the view that a <lb/>degree of &apos;graduateness&apos; of the university experience empowers police constables with <lb/>the critical thinking that higher-level education helps cultivate. 12 In their study, <lb/>McCanney, Taylor and Bates set out to determine whether opportunities existed for <lb/>graduate officers to find the &apos;discretionary space&apos; to employ skills associated with <lb/>university study. 13 Surveying 234 police constables, their analysis revealed that <lb/>officers faced barriers to decision-making from bureaucratic and managerial <lb/></body>

			<body>procedures. The conclusion reached was that police organisations may need to make <lb/>changes structurally and procedurally to benefit from a graduate workforce. Yet, in <lb/>seeking to identify this &apos;discretionary space&apos;, the authors assume that critical faculties <lb/>have been developed, the central issue now becoming whether space is afforded to <lb/>put these skills into practice. 14 The extent to which the objectives of developing critical <lb/>thinkers can be achieved through the PEQF is, however, contested. Lambert, for <lb/>instance, has been critical of the apprentice degrees in general in that only a minimum <lb/>900 hours of learning is required compared to 3,600 hours of a full degree leading to <lb/>&apos;misleading&apos; claims for the student&apos;s achievements. 15 Others assess that there is an <lb/>urgent need for a proper theory of change and the design of logic models to guide the <lb/>design and implementation of the three training routes under the PEQF. 16 Some are <lb/>more reserved in their assessment. Turner notes that &apos;education within a university <lb/>setting could â€¦ provide a balanced approach to student learning and development, <lb/>which would be presented by both police practitioners as educators and academics.&apos; 17 <lb/>The remainder of this article draws on the author&apos;s experience teaching police recruits <lb/>across all three entry-level routes. This article focuses particularly on the challenges <lb/>associated with teaching police recruits about their powers under public law in <lb/>England and Wales before proposing an alternative pedagogical approach, one that <lb/></body>

			<body>combines a focus on human rights with a wider objective of promoting more engaged <lb/>and critical thinking on the part of police recruits. <lb/>From Banking Models to Problem Solving Models of Education Freire&apos;s: Pedagogy <lb/>of the Oppressed <lb/>The starting point for this article is a degree of skepticism surrounding the potential <lb/>for the PEQF to harness critical thinking. Based on experience delivering teaching to <lb/>police recruits, a useful way to think about and conceptualise the challenges faced is <lb/>offered through the banking approach to education as articulated by Paulo Freire. <lb/>Freire was a Brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical <lb/>pedagogy. His approach to pedagogy emerged from his observations and experiences <lb/>working as an instructor in literacy programs with peasant labourers in Brazil. In his <lb/>classic text-the pedagogy of the oppressed-he critiqued what he terms the banking <lb/>model of education. 18 This form of delivery involves an individual-usually a teacher-<lb/>reciting facts and ideas to a group of students who are required to listen and memorize <lb/>the content. 19 Freire identified a distinctlack of connectivity between the content and <lb/>people&apos;s real lives; the banking model is built on the fact that the teacher knows all, <lb/>and there exist inferiors that must just accept what they are told: <lb/>The teacher talks about reality as if it were motionless, static, <lb/>compartmentalized, and predictable. Or else he expounds on a topic <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>18 See Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (30th Anniversary Edition) (Continuum: New York, London, <lb/>2005). The original was published in 1970. <lb/>19 See, for example, Ibid., chapter 2, pages 71-86 <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>61 <lb/></page>

			<body>completely alien to the existential experience of the students. His task is to &quot;fill&quot; <lb/>the students with the contents of his narration-contents which are detached <lb/>from reality, disconnected from the totality that engendered them and could <lb/>give them significance. Words are emptied of their concreteness and become a <lb/>hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity. 20 <lb/>This approach to pedagogy, according to Freire, is a form of oppression. He reasoned <lb/>that it encouraged students to just accept what is thrust upon them as correct. Freire <lb/>concluded that if students are trained to be passive listeners, they will never be able <lb/>to come to the realization that there even exists oppressors. While Freire champions a <lb/>problem-solving model to overcome oppression, the banking model approach to <lb/>teaching is evident in police education and, it is suggested here, a significant barrier <lb/>to the very objective of critical thinking that the PEQF purports to achieve. While there <lb/>is a range of factors that limit the scope for critical thinking in the PEQF context, the <lb/>complexity of the legal landscape and the magnitude of content covered in the <lb/>National Police Curriculum (NPC) provide two useful demonstrations of the creep of <lb/>banking model in this context. The discussion below briefly unpacks both to elucidate <lb/>the need for creativity within the confines set by the framework when attempting to <lb/>deliver police training. <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>20 Ibid., at 71. <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>62 <lb/></page>

			<body>The legal Landscape <lb/>Upon entering the profession, police recruits are required to engage with a complex <lb/>mix of legal and non-legal sources so that, by the end of their training, they are in a <lb/>position to know and apply the law, often in circumstances, which do not permit prior <lb/>reflection and contemplation. 21 Moreover, they must also know and apply the law in <lb/>ways that are compliant with human rights, reflecting the fact that the police are a <lb/>public authority pursuant to section 6 of the Human Rights Act, 1998. The scale of this <lb/>task is evident when considering the multiple sources of law in England and Wales. <lb/>Firstly, the law can be found in primary legislation, such as the Police and Criminal <lb/>Evidence Act (PACE), 1984. As just one piece of legislation, PACE 1984 comprises 11 <lb/>parts, 7 schedules, and 122 provisions. Many of the provisions are themselves highly <lb/>complex, involving layers of legal jargon and statutory semantics. Despite the <lb/>complexity of PACE, it is, however, but one statute. Regarding most areas that engage <lb/>the police in some form, it is rare that just one piece of legislation is applicable. In <lb/>relation to stop and search, for example, powers are also included in the Misuse of <lb/>Drugs Act, 1971, the Firearms Act, 1968, and the Psychoactive Substances Act, 2016, <lb/>as examples. Furthermore, different pieces of legislation place different requirements <lb/>on the use of this power. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, <lb/>for instance, contains a power which allows officers to search without reasonable <lb/></body>

			<body>grounds, sometimes known as &apos;no suspicion&apos; or &apos;section 60&apos; search. 22 The law is also <lb/>included in secondary legislation, which is law created by ministers (or other bodies) <lb/>under powers given to them by an Act of Parliament. The parent Act of Parliament <lb/>will specify the body or person who power has been delegated to by Parliament. <lb/>Often, secondary legislation is used to fill in the details of primary legislation. These <lb/>details provide practical measures that enable the law to be enforced and operate in <lb/>daily life. Police powers have also been developed by the courts. For instance, the <lb/>police have powers of both entry and arrest to prevent a breach of the peace. However, <lb/>an individual officer wishing to ascertain both the existence and scope of these powers <lb/>will not find such authority in the statute books. Rather, they will instead be required <lb/>to engage with court judgements as contained in such databases as Westlaw UK, <lb/>LexisNexis or British and Irish Legal Information Institute. Further complicating <lb/>matters, case law can also be used to develop the scope and contours of primary and <lb/>secondary legislation through a process of statutory interpretation. For the police <lb/>recruit keen to understand the particular contours of these more specific provisions, <lb/>the jurisprudence of English courts, formed as a result of judicial statutory <lb/>interpretation, often &apos;puts meat on the bones&apos; of bare legal provisions. 23 In addition to <lb/>these primary sources of law, recruits are also required to engage with a number of <lb/>additional sources-what we might call soft law. As an example, the College of Policing <lb/></body>

			<body>(CoP) assumes the responsibility for issuing &apos;codes of practice&apos; to Chief Constables. <lb/>These codes of practice are issued under section 39A of the Police Act 1996 (as <lb/>amended) and therefore have a statutory footing. 24 A prominent example of such a <lb/>code is the Code of Ethics, which compliments the policing standards of professional <lb/>behaviour. 25 The Code of Ethics sets out the policing principles that members of the <lb/>police service are expected to uphold and the standards of behaviour they are <lb/>expected to meet. Many forces have their own values statements, which are <lb/>complementary to the Code of Ethics. Sometimes specific legislation requires the <lb/>government to publish guidance on a specific set of powers. For example, part IV of <lb/>the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires the government to publish and <lb/>maintain codes of practice on the powers in the Act (what are known as the PACE <lb/>Codes). Regarding Stop and Search Powers, for instance, the relevant Code of Practice <lb/>is Code A (Home Office, 2015). The College of Policing also publishes Authorised <lb/>Professional Practice (APP) documents. 26 These documents are themed around <lb/>different aspects of policing, advise police staff on how to use their powers lawfully <lb/>and effectively, and are designed to support the training and development of police <lb/>personnel. The police are expected to &apos;have regard&apos; to APP guidance whilst on duty. <lb/>In 2020, the College of Policing updated its Authorised Professional Practice for stop <lb/></body>

			<body>and search in respect of public engagement. 27 There is, furthermore, scope for <lb/>voluntary guidelines and best practice. For instance, the Home Office has published <lb/>guidance on the Best Use of Stop and Search Powers. This is a voluntary scheme, <lb/>which all forces have signed up to, the legislation has not been amended. <lb/>The Police National Curriculum <lb/>Another significant challenge facing the goal of creating critically thinking recruits is <lb/>one that derives from the excessive and unrealistic scope of the National Police <lb/>Curriculum (NPC). The NPC comprises learning standards which have been designed <lb/>to meet policing needs. Each of the learning standards is fully mapped to the <lb/>aforementioned Authorised Professional Practice, as well as to relevant National <lb/>Occupational Standards contained within the Policing Professional Framework. The <lb/>curriculum consists of approximately 23 thematic headings (see box 1). <lb/>Box 1: Themes Addressed in the National Police Curriculum <lb/>Understanding the Police Constable Role <lb/>Valuing Difference and Inclusion <lb/>Maintaining Professional Standards <lb/>Evidence-based Policing <lb/>Problem Solving <lb/></body>

			<page>67 <lb/></page>

			<body>Each of these specific themes has several learning outcomes. For instance, the learning <lb/>outcomes for managing conflict are as follows: <lb/>Box 2: Examples of PNC Learning Outcomes <lb/>1. Examine the theories and models underpinning the causes of conflict within <lb/>policing interventions <lb/>2. Explain the types of situations where conflict may occur and the appropriate <lb/>response <lb/>3. Analyse the ethical and moral implications of the police using force <lb/>4. Identify levels of tension within a conflict situation <lb/>5. Describe the process for determining whether the use of force is necessary in a <lb/>conflict situation <lb/>6. Examine alternatives to using force when involved in a conflict situation <lb/>7. Employ personal protection skills within a conflict situation <lb/>8. Effectively use personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical <lb/>restraints <lb/>9. Effectively use personal safety skills as determined by the specific role of the <lb/>officer or designated operating environment <lb/>10. Account for, and justify the use of force in a conflict situation <lb/></body>

			<page>68 <lb/></page>

			<body>Each learning outcome then disaggregates further to encompass a range of what is <lb/>known as minimum core content-the bare minimum that each learning outcome must <lb/>achieve. These are specific aspects that must be addressed. If we-Effectively use <lb/>personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical restraints-the MCC are as <lb/>follows: <lb/>Box 3: Example of PNC Minimum Core Content <lb/>1. Use of an authorised issue baton <lb/>2. Use of an authorised incapacitant spray, including the effects of such usage and <lb/>aftercare requirements <lb/>3. Application of physical and mechanical restraints <lb/>4. Multi-officer techniques <lb/>5. Possible medical implications following use of restraints and personal safety <lb/>equipment <lb/>6. How to evaluate the use of personal protection equipment <lb/>Thus, notwithstanding the aspirations of the PEQF to develop and harness critical <lb/>thinking police officers, the NPC is, to put it mildly, &apos;very prescriptive about what <lb/>should be taught and as a result of this prescriptive nature [and] this could prevent all <lb/>the benefits of higher education being accessed by the students who undertake these <lb/>69 <lb/>programmes.&apos; 28 The reality that emerges is that police recruits enter the PEQF process <lb/>often with little experience in dealing with the law. The law in England and Wales is <lb/>itself highly complex and multi-tiered, deriving from the constitutional set-up of the <lb/>UK and includes primary and secondary law, common law and judge developed law, <lb/>in addition to a range of additional standards, codes and guidelines. Given the scope <lb/>of police powers and responsibilities, this complex web or information is replicated <lb/>and repeated across different law-related topics, which include but are not limited to <lb/>powers of arrest; entry, search, and seizure; detention and questioning; <lb/>counterterrorism; public protection; and public order, as examples. Added to this, <lb/>police recruits must also engage in a range of non-law topics as defined in the College <lb/>of Policing Curriculum. <lb/>It is the sheer scale and complexity of the task that necessitates a banking approach to <lb/>education. Yet, paradoxically, it is this approach which severely limits the extent to <lb/>which the critical faculties of the recipients are developed. The question that emerges, <lb/>therefore, is how those responsible for delivering police training can cover the <lb/>necessary content while doing so in a manner that cultivates the overarching goal of <lb/>harnessing critical thinking? Against this backdrop, the remainder of this article <lb/>articulates a human rights-based approach to teaching police about their powers. It <lb/>utilizes insights from Paulo Freire&apos;s Pedagogy of the oppressed as the theoretical <lb/>framework. <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>28 See Shohel and others (n.2). <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>70 <lb/></page>

			<body>Towards a problem-solving approach and human rights <lb/>In response to the limitations of the banking model, Freire urges the adoption of the <lb/>problem-posing model. 29 This approach to education encourages a discussion <lb/>between teacher and student. It is, in essence, a method of teaching that promotes <lb/>critical thinking for the purpose of liberation and depends on students as co-creators <lb/>in the delivery of teaching. The distinction between the two was summarised by Freire <lb/>in the following way: <lb/>[Banking education] attempts, by mythicizing reality, to conceal certain facts <lb/>which explain the way men exist in the worldâ€¦. Banking education resists <lb/>dialogue; problem-posing education regards dialogue as indispensable to the <lb/>act of cognition which unveils reality. Banking education treats students as <lb/>objects of assistance; problem-posing education makes them critical thinkersâ€¦. <lb/>Problem-posing education bases itself on creativity and stimulates true <lb/>reflection and action upon reality, thereby responding to the vocation of men <lb/>as beings who are authentic only when engaged in inquiry and creative <lb/>transformation. 30 <lb/>The problem-solving model seeks to blur the distinction between teacher and students <lb/>as everyone learns alongside each other, creating equality. A problem-solving <lb/>approach relies on the constructivist theory, which holds that knowledge is <lb/></body>

			<body>constructed by individuals by using their experiences, which is what Freire drew upon <lb/>in developing his pedagogy. In Pedagogy of the Oppressed Freire wrote: <lb/>Education as the practice of freedom-as opposed to education as the practice <lb/>of domination-denies that man is abstract, isolated, independent, and <lb/>unattached to the world; it also denies that the world exists as a reality apart <lb/>from people. Authentic reflection considers neither abstract man nor the world <lb/>without people, but people in their relations with the world. 31 <lb/>The starting point for a human rights-based approach to teaching is not to view human <lb/>rights as yet another layer to heap onto an already overwhelming pile of existing hard <lb/>and soft law. Instead, it seeks to channel and harness the nature of rights contestation <lb/>and the competing obligations that police officers must attempt to balance. This is <lb/>achieved by asking police recruits, in line with a discursive approach, to think about <lb/>the types of rights issues that a particular police power affects. In Pedagogy of the <lb/>Oppressed, Freire insisted that dialogical encounters help students to develop a <lb/>critical consciousness of social, political, and economic contradictions so that they can <lb/>take action against them. 32 In the context of police powers, however, this dialogical <lb/>exercise can help provide a lens through which to examine legislation. In conformity <lb/>with Freire&apos;s problem-solving approach, the central objective is to develop critical <lb/>thinking. This is done primarily by exploring the nature of competing rights <lb/></body>

			<body>obligations that police officers, as public servants possess by drawing on the <lb/>perspectives and views of police recruits. Understanding these competing claims to <lb/>rights requires officers to draw on their own experience and knowledge in order to <lb/>question how police powers might relate to the safeguarding of human rights. <lb/>Let us take a number of rights in turn by examining the stop and search powers under <lb/>the PACE, 1984. Section 1 of PACE 1984 allows an officer to search a person or vehicle, <lb/>or anything in or on a vehicle if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that stolen <lb/>or prohibited articles, bladed or sharply pointed articles, or prohibited fireworks will <lb/>be found. 33 Not only is the use of stop and search one of the most controversial of <lb/>police powers, it is also an area that illuminates gaps in police knowledge of the law. <lb/>For instance, a 2013 Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report <lb/>examined police compliance with the law in respect of stop and search. 34 The findings <lb/>raised &apos;concerns about the differing views among officers of what constitutes <lb/>reasonable grounds for suspicion, [and raised] questions about the levels of training <lb/>provided to officers and supervisors, and about how they develop a practical <lb/>understanding of reasonable grounds for suspicion. 35 The report also concluded that <lb/>&apos;[t]raining should be improved so that officers better understand, amongst other <lb/>things, what constitutes reasonable grounds.&apos; 36 In 2016, as part of the HMIC&apos;s report <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>33 The items referred to reflect the scope of material which is covered under Part 1 PACE, 1984. Other pieces of <lb/>legislation are concerned with different items. As examples, Section 23 Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971-search for <lb/>controlled drugs; Section 47 Firearms Act, 1968-possession of a firearm; and Section 36 Psychoactive <lb/>Substances Act, 2016-Legal Highs. <lb/>34 HMIC (n. 37) <lb/>35 Ibid., at 29. <lb/>36 Ibid. <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>73 <lb/></page>

			<body>on stop and search powers, questions, which tested officers&apos; knowledge of Code A <lb/>and formed part of the HMIC&apos;s investigation, were put to serving officers. The report <lb/>found that the officers asked answered 82 percent of the questions correctly. 37 While a <lb/>relatively high return, the realities of this statistic are that in 18% of cases, officers were <lb/>uncertain as to their legal powers. Six years later, the scope for improvement remains <lb/>evident. The 2021 Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue <lb/>Services (HMICFRS) report on Stop and Search powers found that while training on <lb/>stop and search has improved, with some examples of good practice, there are still <lb/>gaps in too many officers&apos; skills and knowledge. 38 It also found that &apos;[o]ver 35 years <lb/>on from the introduction of stop and search legislation, no force fully understands the <lb/>impact of the use of these powers. 39 These reports echo earlier research by Quinton <lb/>and others, who identified that officers&apos; knowledge and practices often vary in respect <lb/>of the law, 40 and innumerable studies that identify the lack of reasonable suspicion. 41 <lb/>An initial question to ask recruits is why police are afforded the power of stop and <lb/>search. Police recruits typically respond to the initial questions with a range of <lb/>scenarios and potential rights. One response, for instance, is that where officers stop <lb/>and search an individual and find a knife and where that person intends to use the <lb/>knife to attack a particular individual, the use of the power can protect the right to life. <lb/></body>

			<body>Another is that where police officers stop and search an individual who is in <lb/>possession of stolen goods and where these goods belong to an individual whose <lb/>home has just been robbed, the use of the power can be justified from the perspective <lb/>of protecting the right to property. From an operational perspective, the use of stop <lb/>and search can, in theory, be a significant tool in the armour of the police, one which, <lb/>depending on the circumstances can protect individual rights and the interests of <lb/>society more generally. According to Code A of PACE Act 1984, the power enables <lb/>officers to allay or confirm suspicions about individuals without exercising their <lb/>power of arrest. 42 More concretely, the power can be used, amongst other things, to <lb/>prevent crime, investigate crime, and detect crime. 43 This initial discussion opens <lb/>recruits&apos; minds to interrogating why certain powers are there, what purpose they <lb/>serve and how these powers might relate to human rights issues. <lb/>At the same time, the use of stop and search can undermine rights in various ways. <lb/>The most consequential impact of the use of stop and search has been the <lb/>disproportionate use of the power against the Black community and ethnic <lb/>minorities. 44 In 1999, for instance, the MacPherson report into the death of Stephen <lb/>Lawrence, while not focusing on stop and search specifically, found that institutional <lb/>racism was apparent in the disproportionate use of stop and search against black <lb/></body>

			<body>people. 45 In 2010, the Equality and Human Rights Commission concluded that if you <lb/>are a black person, you are at least six times as likely to be stopped and searched by <lb/>the police in England and Wales as a white person. 46 In 2013, Her Majesty&apos;s <lb/>Inspectorate of Constabulary found that of the 8,783 stop and search records <lb/>examined, 27% did not include sufficient grounds to justify the lawful use of the <lb/>power. 47 These findings mirror those by academics. For instance, Bowling and <lb/>Phillips, writing in 2007, found that the use of the powers against black people is <lb/>disproportionate and that this is an indication of unlawful racial discrimination. 48 The <lb/>second aspect of a rights-based approach to teaching police about their powers is to <lb/>think about the potential adverse impacts on the enjoyment of human rights. Most <lb/>cases, presumably given the high-profile nature of stop and search powers, involve <lb/>some discussion around equality and non-discrimination. The act of stopping and <lb/>searching can also undermine such rights as privacy and the right to be free from <lb/>detention, which is less frequent but nevertheless consistent responses from police <lb/>recruits. The purpose of integrating competing rights considerations into the <lb/>discussion-s that through stop and search, police can both protect and undermine <lb/>rights-is to provide a lens through which to better understand the legislation. That is, <lb/></body>

			<body>in recognising both scenarios, it becomes clearer why the legislation exists as it does. <lb/>For instance, returning to section 1 of PACE, there is an express requirement of <lb/>reasonable suspicion found in section 1(3). The test must be applied to the <lb/>circumstances in each case and is in two parts: (i) Firstly, the officer must have formed <lb/>a genuine suspicion in their own mind that they will find the object for which the <lb/>search power being exercised allows them to search and Secondly, the suspicion <lb/>that the object will be found must be reasonable. 49 Reasonable grounds must be based <lb/>on objective facts. At this point, the question is posed as to why reasonable suspicion <lb/>must be held and what it might mean. Generally, reasonable suspicion must be <lb/>grounded upon objective facts and fall into two categories: Current Intelligence or <lb/>information, for example, the fact that a person matches the description of a suspect <lb/>in a nearby burglary and/or suspicious behaviour, for example, attempting to hide or <lb/>discard something, behaving nervously, or being seen with something that looks like <lb/>a controlled drug. Crucially, &apos;reasonable suspicion cannot be based on generalisations <lb/>or stereotypical images that certain groups or categories of people as more likely to be <lb/>involved in criminal activity.&apos; 50 The requirement of reasonable suspicion informed by <lb/>objective facts can be thus understood against an initial framing of competing rights <lb/>interests; it preserves the power while limiting its application in ways that can be <lb/>discriminatory. <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>49 Home Officer, PACE Code A, 2015 <lb/>50 Home Officer, PACE Code A, 2015, para. 2.2B(b) <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>77 <lb/></page>

			<body>Another example exists in the respect of Section 2 PACE 1984. Under this provision <lb/>officers conducting a stop and search must also provide an individual with certain <lb/>information. For instance, an officer must first explain the grounds for the search. In <lb/>other words, why is the search being conducted? This requirement necessarily ties in <lb/>with the requirements of reasonable suspicion in that to explain why someone has <lb/>been stopped, there first must be a reasonable suspicion to explain. Secondly, an <lb/>officer must explain the object and purpose of the search. To this end, an officer must <lb/>also explain a third element-the legal power being used. These two elements must be <lb/>read together in the sense that the particular legal power being used impacts that <lb/>which can be searched for. In addition, an officer must tell an individual that they are <lb/>being searched alongside providing the identity of the officer, and the station to which <lb/>the officer is attached. If the officer is in plain clothes, they must produce a warrant <lb/>card and a person must be told that they are entitled to a copy of the search. These <lb/>requirements can again be understood against the initial framework of rights <lb/>contestation. The respective legislative provisions exist to balance the potential misuse <lb/>of these with the need to ensure that the police continue to possess the legal capacity <lb/>to conduct stop and searches. <lb/>The above examples demonstrate elements that must be present before, during and <lb/>after conducting a stop and search. The utility of this approach is limited to one aspect <lb/>of the police curriculum, namely police powers. However, the ways in which police <lb/>hold and use these powers are important and rights contestation can be used to <lb/></body>

			<page>78 <lb/></page>

			<body>interrogate a whole host of powers from powers of arrest to questioning, detention to <lb/>entry, search and seizure. Against the backdrop of the initial rights-based framing, <lb/>facilitated through open discussion about competing rights interests that can emerge, <lb/>recruits and officers are informed as to why legislation has been constructed in the <lb/>ways that it is. As a result, recruits are positioned to think critically about why specific <lb/>provisions are contained in the law; the objectives they seek to achieve; and what they <lb/>are attempting to prevent. <lb/>Additional Benefits of a Rights-based Approach <lb/>There are several benefits to a rights-based approach to teaching police powers. <lb/>Firstly, a human rights-based approach places human rights at the centre of police <lb/>education. As noted, not only are the police, as public bodies, legally obligated to <lb/>comply with human rights but this is also a stated aim of the College of Policing which, <lb/>to their credit, has afforded human rights a central place in the PEQF. However, the <lb/>complexity of the law can mean that precisely where human rights fit into these <lb/>obligations can be uncertain. Rather than viewing human rights as yet another layer <lb/>of information-one that sits alongside case law, primary and secondary legislation <lb/>and a suite of guidelines, codes, best practices and recommendations-under a human <lb/>rights-based approach to teaching they form the central element of police education. <lb/>This, inadvertently, helps police officers not only to know what their human rights <lb/>obligations are but to critically engage with competing rights. While looking at stop <lb/>and search, this could be applied in respect of a range of police powers (Bonner and <lb/></body>

			<page>79 <lb/></page>

			<body>Dammert, 2021). 51 Similarly, case law, when utilised correctly, can be used as an <lb/>additional teaching tool one that helps to elaborate on the real-life examples of <lb/>legislative provisions in action. As an example, section 2 of PACE is a provision that <lb/>tends to invoke much discussion amongst police recruits. For instance, while under s. <lb/>2-the requirements to follow GOWISELY-appear in the PACE, 1984, case law has also <lb/>determined that the same information should be given when effecting a stop and <lb/>search under other pieces of legislation, such as the Misuse of Drugs Act. 52 Thus, the <lb/>decisions of the courts help to identify that s.2 PACE must be followed when <lb/>conducting a stop and search under other pieces of legislation. Case law has also <lb/>helped to illuminate that when the police are confronted by a gang, it is not necessary <lb/>to reasonably suspect every member of the gang. 53 Court rulings have also reaffirmed <lb/>that failing to follow the requirements laid down in s. 2 of PACE renders a stop and <lb/>search unlawful. 54 <lb/>Secondly, identifying the tensions inherent in rights not only assists in understanding <lb/>the law. It also acts as an organising concept for other sources. For instance, there will <lb/>always be additional questions on the technical aspects of law; what do we mean by <lb/>personal characteristics when it comes to the idea of reasonable suspicion? How do <lb/>abstract provisions relate to the many different scenarios that police officers are likely <lb/></body>

			<page>80 <lb/></page>

			<body>to face? On this latter point, experience drawn from teaching police recruits <lb/>illuminates that such questions are not only inevitable but also highly desirable and <lb/>useful. In contemplating potential scenarios and searching for answers to these <lb/>hypotheticals, recruits are fully engaging in the process of learning and seeking to <lb/>better interrogate how, faced with a particular set of circumstances, they might react. <lb/>It is here, then, that additional sources of information, such as case law, and in the <lb/>context of PACE Stop and Search powers, PACE Code A, can exist not to add <lb/>additional layers of seemingly unconnected information but rather to elaborate on the <lb/>nature and scope of police powers. For instance, PACE Code A usefully elaborates on <lb/>the characteristics which cannot amount to reasonable suspicion. They include <lb/>someone&apos;s physical appearance (accept where is matches the description of a relevant <lb/>suspect), an individual&apos;s known past convictions, any protected characteristic (age, <lb/>disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy race, religion, sex and sexual orientation), <lb/>generalisations or stereotypes about groups of people. An officer&apos;s hunch or instinct <lb/>is not an objective factor on which to base a reasonable grounds search. 55 <lb/>Thirdly, a human rights-based approach to teaching pushes against the tendencies to <lb/>embrace the banking model of education. For instance, to assist with learning police <lb/>trainers often use a series of pnemonics to help officers remember the law. An example <lb/>is GO WISELY-used to help officers remember the information to be given upon <lb/>stopping and searching someone under certain pieces of legislation. COPPLAN-ID is <lb/></body>

			<body>another, utilised to assist officers in remembering the various grounds for necessity <lb/>under s. 24(5) of PACE when making an arrest. The mnemonic CIAPOAR helps users <lb/>to remember the six key elements of the NDM. It also acts as an aide-memoire in <lb/>aspects of decision-making. As a final example, DIE is used to remember the level of <lb/>search upon arrest. While these mnemonics serve as a useful device in helping officers <lb/>remember legislation, they can also serve to limit any level of critical thinking. For <lb/>example, while the G in GO WISELY is useful in helping to identify the grounds for <lb/>forming reasonable suspicion, they are limited in informing an officer what the basis <lb/>of that suspicion can be. However, understood against the backdrop of competing <lb/>rights, an officer is better equipped to form the basis of suspicion. Thus, a rights-based <lb/>approach can underpin these mnemonics and help ensure that officers are not simply <lb/>regurgitating acronyms in the absence of critical thinking. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The inspiration for this article came from delivering a number of courses as part of <lb/>changes to police recruitment and education. Underpinning these reforms is <lb/>undoubtedly a strong commitment to harnessing a police service that acts fairly, <lb/>lawfully and without discrimination. Indeed, professionalization and developing <lb/>analytical and informed officers is both necessary and desirable. However, achieving <lb/>these objectives is stifled by the complexity of the law, an overly ambitious <lb/>curriculum, and insufficient time afforded to cover the syllabus in sufficient detail. <lb/>The result is that both teaching and learning are rooted in the banking model of <lb/></body>

			<page>82 <lb/></page>

			<body>education where the aspirations of critical development are subverted to getting the <lb/>course done. It is thus necessary to think laterally regarding how best to work within <lb/>this system. As an alternative to the banking model of education, Freire articulated <lb/>what he termed the problem-solving method. Amongst other things, this method of <lb/>teaching emphasizes critical thinking for the purpose of liberation of the individual in <lb/>question. By shifting the delivery of information to a form of collaboration and <lb/>discussion, one where lived experiences and viewpoints of police recruits serve as <lb/>context for learning. A human rights approach to teaching seeks to harness the <lb/>inherent tensions and trade-offs associated with human rights to provide a lens <lb/>through which to look at specific legislative provisions. The intention of doing so is to <lb/>encourage recruits not simply to memorize the law, but to think analytically about <lb/>why the law is the way it is and what objective it seeks to achieve. Moreover, through <lb/>engaging recruits in discussion and debate about the rights that are employed, it is <lb/>recruits who are helping to construct the framework through which to examine and <lb/>understand the law as it will ultimately apply to them. </body>
