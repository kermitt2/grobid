    <front>MEDIEVAL HISTORY AND THE COMPUTER IN FRANCE <lb/></front>

      <body>French medievalists have displayed an early interest in the <lb/>potentialities of the computer, and Michel Mollat probably de -<lb/>serves credit for the first application of the new techniques <lb/>to medieval data in France( 1) . Since then, the National Archives, <lb/>the National Center for Scientific Research (C .N .R .S .) and <lb/>several of its laboratories (notably the Institut de Recherche <lb/>et d &apos; Histoire des Textes -I .R .H .T . -) and some universities, <lb/>where computing facilities are available, have sponsored the <lb/>development of computer techniques applied to medieval data, <lb/>the specificity of which has rendered the task much more dif-<lb/>ficult than it was foreseen . It must be added that close con-<lb/>tacts with experimented foreign research centres (such as the <lb/>Centre de Traitement Electronique des Documents Medievaux <lb/>-CETEDOC -at the University of Louvain in Belgium) have some-<lb/>times smoothed the way to innovation. <lb/>Medievalists have concentrated their efforts an documentary and <lb/>textual applications of the computer . There are many reasons to <lb/>this situation : lack of satisfying statistical data ready for <lb/>use, and wealth of archives material extremely difficult to <lb/>handle are two prominent reasons . In any case, archives is al -<lb/>ways the first problem which the medievalist meets . The National <lb/>Archives are conscious of this fact, and their Service d&apos;Infor-<lb/>matique (directed by I . Cloulas) is currently developing a pro-<lb/>gram of indexation of the XIA series (the Paris Parliament ar -<lb/>chives), offering an easy access to the namesof all persons and <lb/>places mentioned in the process files of the Paris Parliament <lb/>between 1350 and 1363 (2) . <lb/>But useful as it is, this indexation is not a content analysis. <lb/>°A more ambitious project has been elaborated in dose connection <lb/>with the National Archives by the Centre d&apos;Etude d&apos;Histoire <lb/>Juridique, directed by Pierre-Clement Timbal, Mrs . Josette Metman <lb/>being in charge of computer processing . The solution adopted to <lb/>deal with the arrets (sentences) of the Paris Parliament during <lb/>the second half of the fourteenth century has been to build a <lb/>dictionary of concepts summarized by key-words, the thesaurus, <lb/>the content of each document being described only by words bor -<lb/>rowed from the thesaurus . Obviously, the thesaurus has been <lb/>built in reference to the source on which the Centre d&apos;Etude <lb/>d&apos;Histoire Juridique is currently working, but it may prove use-. <lb/>ful to students of law history of later medieval France in <lb/>general (3) . On the other hand, it is true that the specificities <lb/>of medieval vocabulary are obscured, hidden behind the updated <lb/>lexicon of key-words, and that the content analysis, precise as <lb/>it is, cannot pretend to be exhaustive, for it remains dependent <lb/>on a selection of facts or concepts : but the programs, derived <lb/>from the documentary SOCRATE system, are highly efficient, and <lb/>this project has already produced appreciated results . <lb/></body>

      <page>-4 -<lb/></page>

      <body>In fact, content analysis proves specially difficult for the <lb/>medievalist, since he can never take for granted the equivalence <lb/>between medieval and modern words . That is why, if we turn our <lb/>attention towards texts in which the technical element is not <lb/>as overwhelming as in juridical sentences, it becomes necessary <lb/>to have recourse to more sophisticated devices than the use of <lb/>a thesaurus( 4 ) . In this field, Mrs . Lucie Fossier and the <lb/>I .R .H .T . have made important contributions in pointing out the <lb/>interest of extracting key-words from the medieval text itself, <lb/>and of taking into account semantic relationships between words <lb/>in recording not only the key-words and their attributes, but <lb/>also syntactic relations between them( 5) . This method gives <lb/>very satisfying results when applied to cartularies and diplom-<lb/>atic documents in general, and it is not as heavy and burdensome <lb/>to use as full-text recording is .. <lb/>But for documents with a high literary or lexical interest, it <lb/>remains necessary to record full texts, with all the disadvant-<lb/>ages it implies in terms of preparation and Input of the data. <lb/>Being concerned here only with French researches, I shall not <lb/>deal with the programs of the CETEDOC of the University of <lb/>Louvain, though French medievalists have made use of them (6) . <lb/>Mrs . Fossier played an important Part in the birth of one of the <lb/>sections of the Centre de Recherches Appliquees ä la Linguistique <lb/>(C .R .A .L .) at the University of Nancy II : this section is devoted <lb/>to the automatic processing of diplomatic documents of the early <lb/>Middle Ages and is now directed by Michel Parisse e ) . The docu-<lb/>ments being usually of small length (charters etc . . .), they are <lb/>recorded in full text . The first task alloted to the Computer <lb/>is to produce a listing in which each line corresponds to one <lb/>word of the original document . It isthen possible to &quot;enrich&quot; <lb/>the text in coding several sorts of informations (diplomatical, <lb/>onomastical, chronological and so on), word by word : these addi-<lb/>tions need far less time since punched cards have been dropped <lb/>out, informations being conveyed through a Computer terminal <lb/>with screen and teletype . From the &quot;enriched&quot; text, several <lb/>types of vocabularies and concordances may be obtained : alpha-<lb/>betical or chronological dictionaries, frequency tables, ono-<lb/>mastical repertories and so on . A systematic publication of the <lb/>results has started already ( 8 ) . <lb/>Convenient for shorter texts, all methods which imply a large <lb/>amount of coding are to be dismissed for Tonger texts, except <lb/>if the historian wants to pay a special attention to philolo-<lb/>gical or grammatical problems . Readymade programs for textual <lb/>data and concordances generators are available everywhere, most <lb/>notably in France at the Centre de Lexicologie Politique of the <lb/>Ecole Normale Superieure de Saint-Cloud (9) . But once again, the <lb/>medievalist is heavily penalized by the specificity of his data: <lb/>the total contempt for a regular orthograph which characterizes <lb/>both medieval authors and scribes makes it difficult to use <lb/>standard programs . That is why the Equipe de Traitement automa-<lb/>tique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age, working at Paris I under the <lb/></body>

      <page>-5 <lb/></page>

      <body>direction of Bernard Guenee has developed a new concordance <lb/>generator speciall adapted to the difficulties of medieval <lb/>orthograph, ALINE (1o) . It seems possible to combine such an <lb/>approach with more radical documentary processing, since it <lb/>remains impossible to apply full-text recording and process-<lb/>ing to large archives series : a full-text processing of a <lb/>sample of documents will allow the extraction of the key-words <lb/>and will help to define the chief concepts ; then the document-<lb/>ary processing may take place in better conditions . This solu -<lb/>tion is experimented on the JJ series of the National Archives <lb/>(lettres de remission, i .e . letters of pardon) by Mrs . Claude <lb/>Gauvard, with the help of ALINE. <lb/>Documentary treatments are not necessarily based upon existing <lb/>texts . It is also possible to collect and store informations <lb/>and then to ask questions in following syntactic and semantic <lb/>procedures : this requires the elaboration of a . network of connec-<lb/>tions <lb/>between the different pieces of information, and, to a <lb/>certain extent, we reach here the fringes of artificial intel -<lb/>ligence research . Such a project has been developed by G .P. <lb/>Zarri in order to handle data of miscellaneous origins and <lb/>varied natures gathered by C . Bozzolo on the &quot;love &apos; court&quot; of <lb/>King Charles VI for the Equipe de Recherche sur L&apos;Humanisme <lb/>Frangais des XIVe et XVe siecles directed by Gilbert Ouy : this <lb/>is a very promising project (11) . <lb/>Statistical methods have not benefited from the Same interest. <lb/>Medieval data with their usual scantiness are puzzling for the <lb/>statistician, since lacunae mar even the best series of data <lb/>and impose the recourse to solutions too sophisticated for the <lb/>value of the results . Besides, no institution comparable to the <lb/>I .R .H .T . or the C .R .A .L . has given the necessary impulse to re -<lb/>searches in this field : these researches are usually conducted <lb/>by isolated scholars endowed with only small computing facili-<lb/>°ties . One possible exception is the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en <lb/>Sciences Sociales, though its computing centre has attracted <lb/>modern historians (especially demographers) rather than medieval -<lb/>ists . It is nevertheless to this centre that we owe what is by <lb/>far the most accomplished work in this category, the study of <lb/>the fiorentine Catasto of 1427 (a franco-american project in <lb/>fact) made by David Herlihy (University of Wisconsin) and Chri -<lb/>stiane Klapisch (E .H .E .S .S .) . It is difficult to give a fair <lb/>assessment of their achievement, since only partial results are <lb/>available at the moment (12) . But if they were to be judged from <lb/>their different papers, their results ought to be particularly <lb/>important for demography and social history (population mobil-<lb/>ity, repartition of the working men in different trades etc . . .); <lb/>they have had recourse to the most up-to-date methods of factor-<lb/>ial analysis, and they have paid special attention to automatic <lb/>mapping . <lb/></body>

      <page>-6 -<lb/></page>

      <body>Large series of archives have often prompted medievalists to <lb/>engage themselves in computerized treatments . Elizabeth Carpen-<lb/>tier used the Computer to master the great quantities of infor-<lb/>mations contained in the Catasto of Orvieto (13) , whereas <lb/>Mrs . Zerner has tried to adapt her sources (census made in 1414 <lb/>for nearly fifty towns and villages of the Comptat Venaissin) <lb/>to the constraints imposed by the Computer upon its users. <lb/>Miss Billot is also interested in urban history and is using <lb/>the OSIRIS package for at least part of her work on the town of <lb/>Chartres in the later Middle Ages ; and Jacqueline Guiral has <lb/>coded and recorded the data she collected in the customs ac-<lb/>counts of the harbour of Valencia for the second half of the <lb/>fifteenth century (14) : these two researches are still in Pro-<lb/>gress . But results are already on hand for the wills of Lyon in <lb/>the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which have been studied <lb/>by Marie-Therese Lorgin (15 ) : these results are a good example <lb/>of what may be achieved by a limited but discriminate treatment <lb/>of such a heterogeneous and bulky source. <lb/>But if sources are not easily available or adaptable, it is <lb/>always possible to build a &quot;metasource&quot; with materials of dif-<lb/>ferent origins . This is especially true in the case of prosopo-<lb/>graphy and automatic collective biographies, though the border <lb/>between documentary and statistical treatments becomes invisib-<lb/>le here . Thanks to a close analysis of the suppliques and <lb/>lettres communes of the Avignonese popes, a group of scholars <lb/>working under the direction of Bernard Guillemain has been able <lb/>to apply documentary techniques to the pontifical archives( 16 ). <lb/>Part of the efforts and time of the Equipe de Traitement Auto-<lb/>matique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age has been also devoted to <lb/>automatic prosopography . In the course of her thesis on the <lb/>members of the Paris Parliament in the later Middle Ages, Fran-<lb/>Goise Autrand has reconstructed the biographies of 676 indivi-<lb/>duals( 17 ) ; and 1 am working myself an a set of 750 english <lb/>historians who lived between 1300 and 1600 : there is a lot of <lb/>classifying, cross-tabulation and indexation to be done on such <lb/>collections, but factorial analysis will also be used (18) since <lb/>it has produced very interesting results in the study of the (19) <lb/>biographies of the canons of Laon made by Mrs . Helene Millet <lb/>The Same course will be followed for the collections of bio-<lb/>graphies which are being prepared by Alain Demurger (the baillis <lb/>of the King of France in the fifteenth century) and by Mrs. <lb/>Elisabeth Mornet (Danish clerics with a university education). <lb/>Factorial analysis seems to be a very convenient technique (20) <lb/>for the historian, for it enables him to depict and to summarize <lb/>his documentation, as well as it provides him with a secure <lb/>guidance for interpretation : another successful application of <lb/>factorial analysis to historical data which deserves notice is <lb/>Mrs . Fran9oise Micheau&apos;s thesis on translations from the <lb/>arabic (21 <lb/></body>

      <page>-7 <lb/></page>

      <body>Surprisingly enough, fiscal history does not seem to have bene -<lb/>fited from the computer potentialities as much as other sectors. <lb/>Nevertheless, a remarkable success has been achieved by Jacques <lb/>Lefort who has been able to discover the rate of taxation em-<lb/>ployed in the Byzantine Empire during the fourteenth century by <lb/>comparing several rolls of imposition (praktika) : this is a good <lb/>example of how the computer may,help the historian in bringing . <lb/>to light a part of reality which the traditional historian would <lb/>have thought lost for ever (22) . <lb/>This survey is far from complete (23) . A better idea of what is <lb/>going on among French medievalists interested by quantification <lb/>and computerization will be obtained when the results of the <lb/>inquiry supervised by Lucie Fossier with the help of Christiane <lb/>Klapisch, Jacques Lefort and myself will have found their way to <lb/>the column of Computer and Medieval Data Progressing . The publi-<lb/>cation of the reports read at the Rome colloquium in 1975 will <lb/>also provide many new informations on the researches of F .Autrand, <lb/>L. Fossier, Ch . Klapisch, J . Lefort, M . Parisse, J . Verger, <lb/>M. Zerner and many others . But much is still to be done : access <lb/>to machines with good performing capacities remains sometimes <lb/>difficult, especially in provincial universities, and financial <lb/>support is largely inadequate : this is partly due to the fact <lb/>that accounting systems in computing centres have been devised <lb/>to meet the mathematician&apos;s or physicist&apos;s needs, and are very <lb/>unfavourable to historians who are great consumers of reading <lb/>and printing time, and comparatively small consumers of calculus <lb/>time . But the most important drawback is still the lack of infor-<lb/>mation, and even more seriously, the lack of formation of most <lb/>historians : in that respect, if medievalists are not worse than <lb/>their colleagues working on other periods, they are not better . .. <lb/></body>

First, to overcome the analytieal <lb/>deficiencies and the problems of often faint research questions <lb/>within quantitative history as had already been outlined at the <lb/>earlier ZiF conference in 1976 and proved by the QUANTUM documen-<lb/>tation published in 1977 . Second the sections aimed at presenting <lb/>new developments in sociological research which could be applied <lb/>in historical social science too. <lb/>In the section an &quot;Methodological Developments as Foundation for <lb/>a new Encounter between History and Sociology&quot; (chair : Wolfgang <lb/>Sick, QUANTUM) two papers were presented : Theodor Harder (Univer -<lb/>sity of Bielefeld) on &quot;Data, Theory, and Model : A Dynamic Per -<lb/>spective &quot; , Manfred Küchler (University of Frankfurt) on &quot;Complex <lb/>Data Analysis in Practical Research : Multivariate Analyzing of <lb/>Nominal-Scaled Data &quot; . Theodor Harder gave a paper on theory, data, <lb/>models, and real world . Harder portrayed a wide range of dynamic <lb/>non static models and theories of social science phenomenon . He <lb/>stressed the potentials these new models have for historical pro-<lb/>cesses . But these methods have not yet been widely used within <lb/>historical social science . Manfred Küchler presented a &apos;paper de-<lb/>scribing his DIEC-model for analyzing nominal scaled data . This <lb/>approach combines the Goodman and Harder models and makes it <lb/>possible to explain variances in a dependent dichotomous variable <lb/>by the combined effects of more than one dichotomous independent <lb/>variables . In the discussion it was stressed that especially <lb/>historical data are often available only as categorical data and <lb/>that therefore models based on low levels of measurement would be <lb/>very appropriate for historical research . Examples from historical <lb/>research mentioned by the audience made apparent the potentials of <lb/>this kind of data analysis techniques . </listBibl>
