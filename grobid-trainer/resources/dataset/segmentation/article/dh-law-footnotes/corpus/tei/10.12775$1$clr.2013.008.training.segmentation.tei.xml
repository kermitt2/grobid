A lot has changed in the world since then, and the ever-growing <lb/>dependence of the individual on administration (public service) is its visible symptom. Effective <lb/>protection of the interests of the former now requires the use of more diversified control tools <lb/>affording a remedy sooner and at a lower cost, and, in specific situations, also allowing <lb/>administrative courts to decide cases on their merits. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>Judicial review of administration -efficiency of administrative justice -proceedings before <lb/>administrative courts -cassation-type model of administrative jurisdiction -merits review <lb/> Prof. dr hab.

    <body>I. <lb/>One of the four basic requirements considered by the European <lb/>Committee on Legal Cooperation of the Council of Europe to be an element <lb/>of the right to judicial control of public administration is affording <lb/>an effective remedy. Other requirements that the Committee has placed <lb/>in this group of standards are: 1) an independent and impartial court <lb/>established by an act of parliament, which reviews at least the lawfulness <lb/>of the administrative act, 2) a fair hearing within a reasonable time, 3) fair <lb/>and public proceedings during which the dispute between a natural person <lb/>and an administrative authority is heard 1 . The list above, reflecting <lb/>the principles derived by the European Court of Human Rights in <lb/>Strasbourg (ECHR) from Article 6 sec. 1 of the European Convention on <lb/>Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (EC), has taken shape through <lb/>the provisions of the recommendation Rec(2004)20 of the Committee of <lb/>Ministers to Member States of the Council of Europe on the judicial review <lb/>of administrative acts. It links the effectiveness of judicial review with the <lb/>standards of providing the court with appropriate means of redress, <lb/>including the quashing of the disputed administrative act and referring it <lb/>back to the administrative authority to take a new decision that complies <lb/>with the judgement and, where appropriate, decide about compensation <lb/>and ensure effective e x e c u t i o n of the court&apos;s judgement, in compliance <lb/>with the Committee&apos;s recommendation Rec(2003)16 on the execution of <lb/>administrative and judicial decisions in the field of administrative law 2 . <lb/>According to the second of the recommendations referred to above, <lb/>the efficiency of judicial review is identified with both, achieving the <lb/>appropriate result of the review of the act (omission) of an administrative <lb/>authority and getting to a lawful state of affairs, following a court <lb/>judgement arising from the lodged plaint. From the point of view <lb/>of the former aspect, the review is efficient if the court, respecting the <lb/></body>

    <body>procedural rules, applies a remedy that is proportionate to the breach of <lb/>law that has occurred, or -if no such breach has been found -dismisses the <lb/>plaint as ungrounded. Depending on the formula of the remedy afforded, <lb/>the judgement may finally decide the case, e.g., by awarding the plaintiff <lb/>compensation, acknowledging the existence of a right or obligation, or by <lb/>injunction stopping the administrative authority from a specified act (full <lb/>remedy action also referred to as contentieux de pleine juridiction). It may, <lb/>however, create premises only for the case to be resolved by the relevant <lb/>administrative authority (action for annulment or contentieux de <lb/>l&apos;annulation) 3 . In a situation that is typical of the Polish system of <lb/>administrative courts, where a judgment acknowledging the legitimacy <lb/>of the plaint creates an interim legal situation (effecting the purpose of the <lb/>review requires a new administrative act) the basic problem is prompt and <lb/>full execution of the judgment. Only if this condition is met, can we talk <lb/>about the external efficiency of the review. This should be distinguished <lb/>from the internal efficiency, associated with satisfying a number of <lb/>standards of court proceedings, set out by the constitution and conventions <lb/>ratified by Poland, before the judgment is passed 4 . Judgments of the Polish <lb/>Constitutional Tribunal do not explicitly treat the efficiency of protection as <lb/>constituent of the right to have one&apos;s case heard by an independent court, <lb/>yet -as highlighted in the literature of the subject -it may be seen as <lb/>derived from one of the constituents of this right, namely the right <lb/>to appropriate court proceedings 5 . <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>3 The two co-existing and complementary jurisdiction models are studied especially by <lb/>French and British writers -cf. e.g., R. Chapus, Droit du contentieux administratif, Paris: <lb/>Montchrestien 2001, p. 187 et seq.; J.-C. Ricci, Contentieux administratif, Paris: Hachette 2007, <lb/>p. 41 et seq.; A. Carroll, Constitutional and Administrative Law, Edinburgh 2002, p. 269 et seq., <lb/>329 et seq.; W. Wade, C. Forsyth, Administrative Law, Oxford, New York: Oxford University <lb/>Press 2009, p. 473 et seq. In the context of recours objectif and recours subjectif it is discussed by <lb/>A. J. Bok, Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions by the Dutch Administrative Courts: <lb/>Recours Objectif or Recours Subjectif? A Survey Including French and German Law, <lb/>[in:] F. Stroink, E. van der Linden (eds), Judicial Lawmaking and Administrative Law, Antwerp: <lb/>Intersentia 2005, p. 153 et seq. A survey of solutions applied in Europe is to be found <lb/>in: Council of Europe&apos;s Project Group on Administrative Law, supra note 1, pp. 173-198. <lb/>4 More on this distinction -cf. Z. Kmieciak, Efektywność sądowej kontroli administracji <lb/>publicznej [The Efficiency of the Judicial Control over Public Administration], Państwo i Prawo <lb/>[State and Law] 2010, no. 11, p. 22. <lb/>5 Similarly in, among others: A.

<body>II. <lb/>Ensuring the appropriate level of external efficiency of judicial control <lb/>of public administration is, basically, about actions for annulment, and <lb/>decisions are made on the premises of an annulment type of jurisdiction. <lb/>This is a model now prevailing in Europe, which should not obscure the <lb/>fact that the application of protection measures typical of full remedial <lb/>action is on the increase. This can be illustrated by the powers granted <lb/>to Dutch administrative courts under Articles 8.72, 8.73 § 4 and 8.86 of the <lb/>General Administrative Law (Algemene wet bestuursrecht), in force since <lb/>1 January 1994. They may, in justified cases in which the disputed act is <lb/>ex tunc annulled, issue 1) substitute decisions, 2) the so-called accessory <lb/>judgments on compensation related to the loss caused by the challenged <lb/>administrative act, and 3) immediate judgments on the merits of the case 6 . <lb/>The introduction of these measures has been described as furnishing <lb/>the courts with additional powers of redress, raising no doubts whatsoever <lb/>about their connection with judicial review commenced by a plaint <lb/>for annulment of an administrative act 7 . <lb/>Quite another issue is that the lawmakers of many states have allowed <lb/>courts reviewing administrative acts to hear and examine evidence to <lb/>supplement the factual information in the files or to establish relevant facts <lb/>&quot;from scratch&quot;. Evidence from the testimony of the parties, witnesses and <lb/>expert witnesses and from visual inspection is provided for, by among <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>of the Consititutional Court&apos;s Case Law], Łódź: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego 2006, <lb/>pp. 70-71. Representative of the trend is the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal <lb/>of 24.02.2003 (K 28/02) in which it acknowledges that &quot;it is the task of the lawmaker to create <lb/>a normative situation ensuring not only the right to have one&apos;s case heard by an independent <lb/>court but also to have its judgment executed&quot;. <lb/>6 Bok, supra note 3, p. 176. In the Polish literature -cf. Z. Kmieciak, Postępowanie <lb/>administracyjne i sądowoadministracyjne a prawo europejskie [Administrative and Administrative <lb/>Court Proceedings v. European Law], Warszawa: Wolters Kluwer Polska 2010, p. 106. A decision <lb/>mentioned in (1) is possible when there is only one lawful alternative to the disputed act <lb/>or when because of a factual dispute the court conducts proceedings to establish facts; as to <lb/>the Italian system of administrative jurisdiction -see V. Parisio, Concentrazione, garanzia <lb/>e pregiudiziale di annullamento: cenni, [in:] V. Parisio (ed.), I processi amministrativi in Europa tra <lb/>celerità e garanzia, Milano: Giuffre 2009, p. 181 et seq. After the enforcement of Law <lb/>No. 2005/2000, one may notice the concentration of legal claims and actions towards <lb/>administrative courts, while before that time the applicant had to address two different <lb/>judges: the administrative court in order to quash the illegal administrative decision and, <lb/>after that, the civil one, in order to obtain the demanded indemnity. <lb/>7 Bok, supra note 3, p. 176. <lb/></listBibl>

<body>others, the legislation of Germany, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands 8 . <lb/>Another instrument used in the course of the review to provide the court <lb/>with necessary knowledge is additional clarification that the court requires <lb/>from the administrative authority or an entity independent from <lb/>the administration, for instance in the form of an expert&apos;s report. The latter, <lb/>as a form of unbiased position on the case, may be an motive for the parties <lb/>to seek an amicable resolution of their dispute (alternative dispute <lb/>resolution measures) -a fact observed in many countries 9 . <lb/>III. <lb/>In the context of the observations above, the proposition that it is <lb/>possible to maintain a uniform (pure) cassation-type jurisdiction model <lb/>in Europe, like the classic Austro-Hungarian model of the late 19 th century, <lb/>cannot hold up to criticism 10 . Even in Austria itself, the idea seemed to be <lb/>contradicted first by the establishment of independent administrative <lb/>tribunals (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate in den Ländern), which in a form <lb/>that was typical of administration, performed some of the judicial review <lb/>tasks. At the same time, the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) <lb/>might decide a complaint about the omission to act by an administrative <lb/>authority on its merits 11 .

<body>lawmaker introduced a two-tier system of administrative judiciary and <lb/>empowered the courts to adjudicate on the merits of a case. Besides <lb/>Verwaltungsgerichtshof which has existed since 1876, administrative courts <lb/>of first instance on the states (Länder) level and two administrative courts <lb/>of first instance on federal level: Federal Administrative Court <lb/>(Bundesverwaltungsgericht) and Federal Finance Court (Bundesfinanzgericht) <lb/>have been established (so called 9+2 model) 12 . <lb/>The discussion highlights the need for some of the views on the <lb/>function of judicial review of administrative acts, well-established in the <lb/>tradition of the system, to be revised. This is now given the name <lb/>of Überprüfung and is gaining significance. Judicial control of the <lb/>administration of today -if it is to be efficient -should, apart from <lb/>removing the unlawful act and giving the administrative authority <lb/>a binding instruction on further action to be taken (a clear formulation <lb/>of the necessary and methodologically appropriate instructions), offer <lb/>a greater range of remedies that are suitable for the circumstances of the <lb/>specific case. The shortcomings of the cassation-type model of <lb/>administrative jurisdiction were already seen in Poland many years ago <lb/>and various proposals for its improvement were made 13 .

<body>for years been developing in European case law, provides not only for the <lb/>appropriate proceedings before a judicial body with &quot;full jurisdiction&quot; 14 , <lb/>but also for the proper execution of the delivered judgment. This gives rise <lb/>to understandable questions about the institution of judicial control <lb/>of administration. If we assume that the fulfilment of the latter obligation <lb/>is but a phase of a process that has only seemingly been concluded, <lb/>the problems of securing the protection envisaged in the legislation still <lb/>remain 15 , not to mention the legal consequences of defaulting on the <lb/>directive of &quot;reasonable time&quot; within which the case should be decided, <lb/>should a plaint be lodged with the ECHR. <lb/>IV. <lb/>The development of the Polish law on judicial control proceedings <lb/>shows that the lawmakers, aware of the difficulties in ensuring the <lb/>appropriate efficiency of the reviews, have gradually enlarged the range <lb/>of available measures, which are meant to curtail or mitigate <lb/>the deficiencies of the cassation-type jurisdiction. Examining the situation <lb/>before the Second World War, W. Sawczyn recalls that &quot;there was fairly <lb/>common awareness of the inefficiency of judicial control of administrative <lb/>acts, and consequently, various efforts were made to remedy the <lb/>situation&quot; 16 . The ideas then advanced, also by representatives of the legal <lb/></body>
    
    <listBibl>14 This term and the notion of an &quot;effective judicial review&quot;, were used by the ECHR in its <lb/>judgment of 28.06.1990 (application no. 11761/85) on the widely-known Obermeier v. Austria <lb/>case. <lb/>15 This is the case with many ECHR judgments, among others of 16.12.2008 (application <lb/>no. 42619/04) Vlahović v. Serbia and of 6.04.2010 (application no. 35852/04) Ursan v. Romania. <lb/>The Court expressed its stance that the execution of a binding court judgment should be <lb/>viewed as &quot;an integral part of the trial&quot; under Article 6 of EC. Also in the literature of <lb/>the subject, acts of an administrative authority pursuant to a judgment recognising the claim <lb/>as legitimate are regarded as &quot;a phase of the process&quot; -cf. e.g., B. J. Schueler, Settling <lb/>of Disputes in Administrative Law in the Netherlands, [in:] Y.

<body>doctrine, failed to materialise. The young democracy, for pragmatic reasons <lb/>using available legal solutions, did not have the right conditions to make <lb/>that happen. The meeting of other standards, today associated with <lb/>internal efficiency requirements, was then considered to be a problem <lb/>of greater importance -in particular finding a way to deal with <lb/>the lengthiness of proceedings before the Supreme Administrative <lb/>Tribunal 17 . <lb/>When administrative jurisdiction was restored in 1980, there was only <lb/>one measure available to them in response to administrative malfunction <lb/>or omission -that of s i g n a l l i n g the fact that an administrative act <lb/>on which the decision had been based was inconsistent with or in breach <lb/>of the relevant law. The 11 May 1995 -Law on the Supreme Administrative <lb/>Court 18 introduced a system of sanctions to discipline the administration <lb/>as a way of ensuring that administrative authorities would perform <lb/>the duties specified in the course of judicial review or resulting from court <lb/>judgments. The sanctions were also to have a preventive and compensatory <lb/>function. The system, with some minor modifications, was taken over <lb/>by the provisions of the 30 August 2002 -Law on Proceedings before <lb/>Administrative Courts (p.a.c.) 19 . <lb/>Among others, the system includes: 1) a fine for not executing <lb/>the judgement acknowledging the legitimacy of the plaint about refusal <lb/>to act by administrative authority, or if the authority refuses to act after the <lb/>court annuls an administrative act or declares it null and void, 2) the ruling <lb/>-in addition to the fine -on the existence or non-existence of a right <lb/>or obligation, if this is allowed by the nature of the case and non-litigious <lb/>circumstances of its factual and legal status, 3) notification of the relevant <lb/>body about the qualified breach of law discovered by the court, including <lb/>gross neglect of not making the complaint, the relevant documentation and <lb/>the authority&apos;s reply available to the court and about the circumstances <lb/>affecting such breach of law. <lb/>Provisions of Article 154 § 4-5 of p.a.c. stipulate that the person <lb/>aggrieved by the non-execution of the judgment may claim compensation <lb/></body>

<body>from the authority guilty of omission under the rules defined in the Civil <lb/>Code. This is supplemented by the possibility of seeking compensation, <lb/>provided for by Article 287 of p.a.c., if the court: 1) has overruled <lb/>the decision appealed against and the authority to whom the case is <lb/>referred back dismisses it, 2) has declared the act invalid or found a legal <lb/>impediment to declaring such invalidity. Compensation is payable by <lb/>the authority that issued the decision (act). Under the former regime, <lb/>compensation may be claimed if a loss has occurred as a result of <lb/>the n o n f e a s a n c e of the administrative authority in the form of <lb/>non-execution of the judgment of the court. The regulation introduced <lb/>by Article 287 of p.a.c. applies when the loss is related to the l e g a l <lb/>s t a t u s arising from declaring a decision invalid by the court or finding an <lb/>impediment to making the sanction work. The liability of the <lb/>administrative authority in this case does not depend on its unlawful <lb/>conduct, which can always be assigned to it should it have failed to execute <lb/>the decision of the court 20 . The protection extended by Article 287 of p.a.c. <lb/>is meant to offset the effects of the cassation-type judgment of the <lb/>administrative court, which for objective reasons cannot be executed. <lb/>V. <lb/>Of the measures mentioned above and designed to strengthen the <lb/>effectiveness of judicial control of public administration it is the possibility <lb/>of deciding a case on its merits stipulated by Article 154 § 2 of p.a.c., that <lb/>arouses the greatest controversies. An opinion is frequently voiced that <lb/>a ruling about the existence or non-existence of a right or an obligation <lb/>stipulated by the said article &quot;remains a ruling about the effects <lb/>of breaching the law by an administrative authority&quot;. This is because <lb/>the court passes its ruling &quot;in a situation which, in a way, is the recidivism <lb/>of the administrative authority -its first breach caused the plaint to be <lb/>filed with the court, while the second breach was in ignoring <lb/>the administrative court judgment&quot; 21 . It should also be remembered that <lb/>the subjective scope for the court to decide a case &quot;on its merits&quot; is <lb/>relatively narrow.

<body>Administrative Court in Warsaw of 5 August 2010 (I SA/Wa 38/10), <lb/>&quot;In principle, the administrative court may not take over an administrative <lb/>matter and decide it directly&quot;. The opinion of this particular court is that <lb/>Article 154 § 2 of p.a.c., which is an exception to this rule, only applies <lb/>when instead of an administrative decision or ruling, an act or action <lb/>concerning the right or obligations ensuing from provisions of the law has <lb/>been taken. This is a position shared by many representatives of the legal <lb/>doctrine. Unfortunately, the stipulation discussed here remains &quot;dead&quot; <lb/>(is hardly used in practice). <lb/>The judgment issued under Article 146 § 2 of p.a.c. can be classified <lb/>as a variant of &quot;deciding a case on its merits&quot;. This provision is sporadically <lb/>applied by administrative courts. Under this article, if the case has been <lb/>brought not against an administrative decision or ruling, but against an act <lb/>or action concerning the right or obligations ensuing from provisions of the <lb/>law (often referred to as physical act), the court in its judgment may <lb/>acknowledge the legitimacy of such right or obligation. For instance, <lb/>the judgment of the Regional Administrative Court in Białystok of <lb/>26 January 2010 (II SA/Bk 699/09) pronounces the invalidity of the refusal <lb/>to return part of the fee for the issue of a vehicle ID and recognises the right <lb/>of the plaintiff to recover the money. In the judgments on identical cases <lb/>heard by Polish regional administrative courts in Olsztyn -26 August 2010 <lb/>(II SA/01 450/09) and in Gdańsk -9 September 2010 (III SA/Gd 289/10), <lb/>the invalidity of disputed administrative acts was tied to the <lb/>acknowledgment of the obligation of the administrative authorities to <lb/>return the sums unduly charged. The acknowledgment in the judgment <lb/>quashing an act or pronouncing its invalidity as to the rights or obligations <lb/>ensuing from provisions of the law may be interpreted as affording the <lb/>plaintiff an effective remedy by a ruling of a declaratory nature, similar <lb/>to declaratory judgment in the systems of common law 22 . Using this <lb/>remedy is meant to describe (confirm as binding) the legal status <lb/>of the plaintiff, however without direct sanction against the defendant -<lb/></body>

<body>a public authority 23 . On the basis of such court judgment, the plaintiff may <lb/>effectively exercise his/her rights or obligations within strictly defined <lb/>legal boundaries. <lb/>Sporadic opinions expressing doubts about the wisdom of granting <lb/>administrative courts the powers (very limited indeed) to decide the case <lb/>on its merits seem to be evidence of a rigid clinging to the idea that the <lb/>judiciary and the administration are separate powers. According to <lb/>S. Jansen, the balance between the two would actually be upset if the <lb/>judiciary were deprived of a greater influence on the other power. Hence, <lb/>in his opinion, in order to afford full protection to those who need it, <lb/>the administrative courts must get more involved in administrative action <lb/>and engage in effective and conclusive dispute settlement 24 . <lb/>VI. <lb/>While appreciating the importance of the additional, multi-function <lb/>remedies outlined above, we must remember that the external <lb/>effectiveness of the judicial control of administration exercised as an action <lb/>for annulment mainly depends on the mode adopted to settle the dispute, <lb/>including the formula of judgements and instructions for further action, <lb/>provided in the written justification of the judgment allowing <lb/>the complaint. The solutions presented in section (2) above, shaped <lb/>by the Dutch General Administrative Law, undoubtedly indicate <lb/>the efforts to harmonise the requirements of cassation-type judgements <lb/>made by administrative courts with the need to afford an effective remedy <lb/>to the plaintiff, devoid of excessive burden and respecting the directive <lb/>on &quot;reasonable time&quot; of the settlement of the dispute, derived from <lb/>Article 6 sec. 1 of EC. <lb/>The Dutch lawmaker, for a long time trying hard to greatly reform <lb/>the rather complex system of administrative courts, gave the competences <lb/></body>

<body>to the courts to apply the construction of &quot;administrative loop&quot; (bestuurlijke <lb/>lus) in some types of disputes. Technically speaking, the use of this <lb/>construction means that the court issues an interlocutory j u d g m e n t . <lb/>It has its equivalents in other legal systems, e.g. in France (jugement d&apos;avant <lb/>dire droit) and in Germany (Zwischenurteil). The issue of an &quot;administrative <lb/>loop&quot;, or the power to rectify the legality of an administrative decision was <lb/>considered in detail in the seminar organised by the Association of <lb/>the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the <lb/>European Union with the collaboration of the Council of State of Belgium <lb/>(Brussels, 1-2 March 2012). The two following issues were the subject <lb/>of the seminar as well: 1) power to award compensation and action <lb/>for annulment, 2) the effectiveness of enforcement of the rulings <lb/>of administrative courts (power of injunction) 25 . <lb/>Without going into details of individual varieties of &quot;administrative <lb/>loop&quot;, we can say that using this measure assumes the suspension <lb/>of judicial procedure until a competent administrative body submits <lb/>a modified draft decision taken with due regard to the findings of the court <lb/>thus far 26 . The interlocutory judgment indicates insofar as possible how <lb/>to rectify the infringement. In this case, the administrative body must <lb/>inform the court as soon as possible whether it intends to take up the <lb/>option, offered by the court, of rectifying the infringement or having <lb/>it rectified. Where the administrative body accedes to the request to rectify <lb/>the infringement, it shall indicate in writing as soon as possible how it is <lb/>going to rectify it. The parties may, within a set period following said <lb/>written notification being sent, indicate their attitude to rectification <lb/>of the infringement. A final judgment shall be handed down upon the first <lb/>appeal against the flawed administrative decision that has been (or has not <lb/>been) rectified 27 .

<body>giving greater certainty about the result of the proceedings and speeding <lb/>up the settlement of the case, is the court&apos;s statement that the disputed <lb/>decision is voidable. It is useful when there is no possibility of making <lb/>factual findings within judicial procedure (e.g. making calculations <lb/>relevant for the content of future settlement), as well as the fact that courts <lb/>are reluctant to interfere with administrative policies 28 . <lb/>According to G. ten Berge and P. Langbroek, the main advantage of <lb/>the solution under discussion is the fact that the interlocutory judgment <lb/>contains &quot;specific instructions&quot; which in a sense determine the scope of <lb/>lawful acts of an administrative authority, which must take into account <lb/>the inevitable verification of the draft decision in further judicial review 29 . <lb/>They also point out that, in the present regulatory environment, <lb/>an administrative authority can remove any shortcomings of the act in the <lb/>course of procedures initiated by an appeal (on general terms) lodged with <lb/>an administrative court only under the institution autorevision provided <lb/>for in Article 6:18 of the General Administrative Law. In their opinion, <lb/>the institution of autorevision would be more effective if the impulse <lb/>for &quot;repair&quot; procedures were instructions given by the court as a result <lb/>of commencing an &quot;administrative loop&quot; 30 .

<body>of interlocutory judgments) could probably be applicable in Poland, too. <lb/>I think using this kind of tool should be taken into consideration, <lb/>particularly in cases whose settlement by public administrative authorities <lb/>takes a very long time, thus exposing the plaintiffs to inconvenience and <lb/>hardship, disproportionate to the scale of the problem. Obviously, <lb/>the question arises whether the legislators (if they appreciate the value of <lb/>the institution) will dare to give the courts enough discretion to use it. <lb/>The alternative to this construction would be a court order for the <lb/>competent administrative authority to issue an administrative act of a <lb/>predefined content (giving specific rights or imposing specific obligations), <lb/>or even the court&apos;s decision &quot;on the merits&quot; replacing the annulled act. <lb/>The external efficiency of control exercised by administrative courts <lb/>according to classic models of cassation decisions is also -as has been <lb/>mentioned before -a derivative of the way of instructing administrative <lb/>authorities on further action when a complaint has been allowed. <lb/>The lengthiness of judgment execution and execution inconsistent with the <lb/>intent of the court (usually leading to another complaint) do not always <lb/>have their source in the reluctance to accept the results of the judicial <lb/>review. They can also result from faulty formulation of legal appraisal <lb/>and instructions (recommendations) on further proceedings before an <lb/>administrative authority, contained in the justification of the judgment, <lb/>and binding -in accordance with Article 153 of p.a.c. -for the court and <lb/>the authority whose act or omission to act were the subject of the plaint. <lb/>Certainly, there must be a reason why cassation appeals of administrative <lb/>authorities against first instance judicial review decisions often make <lb/>charges about vague, too general, factually inconsistent, or unfeasible <lb/>recommendations (instructions), or even lack of recommendations <lb/>in judgment justifications. A survey of the decisions of the Supreme <lb/>Administrative Court provides a number of instances of such errors. <lb/>Its judgment of 15 July 2010 (II FSK 467/09) states that the lack <lb/>of recommendations concerning further action merely created &quot;an illusion <lb/>of efficiency of the review&quot;. In its judgment of 10 January 2012 <lb/>(II FSK 1308/10), the Supreme Administrative Court states that the <lb/>administrative authority is given &quot;conflicting instructions&quot;. <lb/>While drafting the provisions of Article 141 § 4 in fine and Article 153 <lb/>of p.a.c., the lawmaker showed great restraint in defining model <lb/></body>

<body>instructions for administrative authorities. The instructions were simply <lb/>defined as &quot;indications&quot;, with a focus on an inseparable relationship <lb/>between the instruction part and the judicial appraisal in the justification of <lb/>the judgment. The judicial appraisal creates grounds for the establishment <lb/>of directives for conduct of the administrative authority, which determine <lb/>its obligations in the case. Naturally, there are limits to statutory <lb/>formalisation of the contents of judicial instructions. In my opinion, <lb/>a sensible lawmaker should allow the core of the issue to be moved from <lb/>legislation to j u d i c i a l p r a c t i c e . Only judicial practice can create <lb/>optimal recommendation techniques, escaping procedural rigidity, <lb/>and respecting the long-standing experience of administrative courts. <lb/>It can be assumed that the instructions in the meaning of Article 141 § 4 <lb/>of p.a.c. are &quot;hidden&quot; or weaker forms of injunction 32 . <lb/>VIII. <lb/>In the cassation-type model of administrative jurisdiction, <lb/>administrative courts in principle only investigate the administrative <lb/>body&apos;s compliance with the law. The main weakness of this adjudication <lb/>model is that the same case is consecutively heard by administrative <lb/>authorities and administrative courts (of various instances), without a final <lb/>decision being issued 33 . The discussion above makes us aware of the need <lb/>to debunk certain myths that still persist in some European countries and <lb/>result from an erroneous understanding of the concept of judicial review <lb/>of administrative acts (or omissions), and the principle of separation <lb/>of powers in a Democratic State of Law. The stereotype of a court coined <lb/>in another epoch as a purely cassation-type body must not obscure <lb/>the challenges of our times. A lot has changed in the world since then, and <lb/>the ever-growing dependence of an individual on administration (public <lb/>service) is its visible symptom.

<body>former now requires the use of more diversified control tools affording <lb/>a remedy sooner and at a lower cost, and, in specific situations, also <lb/>allowing administrative courts to decide cases on their merits 34 . In this <lb/>context we should look for an answer to the question of R. Walter: <lb/>Kassatorische oder reformatorische Entscheidung 35 . <lb/>In the Polish system of law the administrative courts do not possess <lb/>the means to rectify a flawed decision similar to the &quot;administrative loop&quot; <lb/>concept prescribed by Dutch law. The power to quash a decision which <lb/>gives doubts to its legality is generally considered a sufficient measure <lb/>of judicial review. Many scholars point out that the present system <lb/>applicable in Poland is incomplete 36 . It seems that introduction of a means <lb/>similar to an &quot;administrative loop&quot; would be beneficial in improving <lb/>the effectiveness of judicial review, especially in &quot;hard cases&quot;. However, <lb/>there is a certain plan to introduce such measure in the nearest future. <lb/>The proposed modifications of the proceedings before administrative <lb/>courts aim at the creation of solutions which make it possible -as long as <lb/>the appeal is successful -to annul the decision appealed against <lb/>or to declare it invalid and to impose a manner of handling or settling <lb/>the case on the administrative authority. <lb/></body>
