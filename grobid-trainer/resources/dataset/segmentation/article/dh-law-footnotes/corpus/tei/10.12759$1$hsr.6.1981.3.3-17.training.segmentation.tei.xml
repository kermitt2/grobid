    <body>The study of demographic history in the United States has come a <lb/>long way since its emergence in the mid-1960s . It was really only <lb/>then that American scholars of European and United States history <lb/>first began to ask the kinds of questions that were of concern to <lb/>French and British demographic historians, and to apply the <lb/>techniques for demographic historical analysis that they had de-<lb/>veloped .(1) In the spring of 1968, the editors of Daedalus, a &apos; <lb/>journal published by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, <lb/>published a collection of articles on the theme of &quot;Historical <lb/>Population Studies&quot; as a means of introducing the American scholarly <lb/>community to this relatively new body of research . Only about half <lb/>of the authors represented in the collection were from the United <lb/>States, and it is fair to say that none of their studies could <lb/>truly be characterized as demographic history . These largely ten-<lb/>tative and exploratory essays represented rather a first attempt <lb/>to define some problem areas and to carve out a place for de-<lb/>mographic study in the emergent field of social history .(2) From <lb/>this modest and recent beginning, the study of demographic history <lb/>in the United States has expanded dramatically .(3) Any effort brief-<lb/>ly to characterize so lively a field is bound to be fragmentary . The <lb/>essay which follows is an attempt to look at the evolution of, and <lb/>some current directions in, research on a few clusters of central <lb/>problems . The works discussed have been selected as exemplary of the <lb/>field ; no attempt will be made to be exhaustive in covering the <lb/>numerous and quite diverse collection of historical demographic <lb/>works which have been published by American scholars. <lb/>The methods of historical demography were first applied in the United <lb/>States to an analysis of the immigrant British population of colonial <lb/></body>

			<body>New England .(4) Beginning in 1965, there appeared a series of public-<lb/>ations which employed the newly developed techniques like family re-<lb/>constitution and aggregative analysis of parish and civil registers <lb/>to reconstruct the demographic history of selected colonial commun-<lb/>ities . In particular, the pioneering works of John Demos(5), Kenneth <lb/>Lockridge(6), and Phillip Greven(7) first integrated a demographic <lb/>analysis into the historical portrayal of daily life and social in-<lb/>stitutions in New World communities . In discussing these early explor-<lb/>ations, Lockridge would later maintain that they showed that the <lb/>transatlantic migrations did not transform &apos;the European peasant&apos; in <lb/>terms of essential behaviors and attitudes(8) (one wonders what he <lb/>meant by this since colonial New England was not populated by <lb/>&apos;peasants&apos; as the term is usually meant!) . These early studies none-<lb/>theless uncovered some apparent striking demographic contrasts bet-<lb/>ween the Old World and the New : higher completed fertility in the <lb/>colonies, more youthful female marriage, lower infant mortality, <lb/>greater longevity .(9) (A slightly later study by Daniel Scott Smith <lb/>actually directly compared Swedish records with those of a New <lb/>England community, using techniques which allowed the analysis of <lb/>the various components of population growth . Smith found levels of <lb/>marital fertility that were comparable, and was thus able to <lb/>attribute the faster population growth rate in the colonies to <lb/>higher levels of nuptiality and lower mortality(1O) . These early <lb/>studies, restricted as they were to data from individual communities, <lb/>employing for the most part only descriptive statistics, often re-<lb/>sorting to dubious methods and corrective measures, nonetheless <lb/>isolated important demographic questions, questions which have re-<lb/>mained central to demographic and social historical analysis as <lb/>it has reached into other regions of the United States, and other <lb/>periods of American history . These problem areas include : the re-<lb/>lationships between economic opportunity, especially in the form <lb/>of landholding, and demographic patterns ; changing family and <lb/>community life under the impact of immigration and rapid population <lb/>growth ; changes in demographic behavior and attitudes between first <lb/>generation migrants and their descendants. <lb/>The relationship between family processes and land inheritance <lb/>patterns has been as important for the demographic history of the <lb/>United States as it has been in Europe . Naturally, the greater <lb/>availability of land in frontier regions and the lesser communal <lb/>control over its disposal made it seem likely to researchers that <lb/>the demographic consequences would be somewhat different from the <lb/>European pattern . In fact, U .S . frontier areas have served as a <lb/>sort of historical laboratory for social scientists interested, <lb/>in particular, in the connections between land availability and <lb/>fertility . Best known of these is Richard Easterlin, an economist <lb/>whose hypotheses about economic determinants of family size have <lb/>been tested historically in frontier areas . Easterlin&apos;s early <lb/>works(11) laid out his model . More recent empirical studies based <lb/>largely on multivariate analysis from U .S . and state census ma-<lb/>terials have begun to examine the relationship between changing <lb/>farm conditions and rural fertility patterns in the United States <lb/>in the late 19th century(12) . Similar methods and models have been <lb/>used in studies like those of John Modell or Peter Lindert(13), <lb/>studies which help to account for general and differential trends <lb/>in the fertility decline which occurred in the U .S . beginning in <lb/>the 19th century . A more recent project entitled &quot;Family Strategy <lb/>in the Upper Midwest&quot;, under the direction of Russell Menard, will <lb/></body>

			<body>examine the impact on fertility strategies in rural northern <lb/>Minnesota and Wisconsin of economic developments like commercial <lb/>agriculture and mining industry . Like many of the more recent <lb/>analyses of demographic change in the United States, the Upper <lb/>Midwest Fertility Project employs a life-course perspective in <lb/>its analysis of Federal and state census materials, and uses mul-<lb/>tivariate techniques to test hypotheses about relationships bet-<lb/>ween economic and demographic change .(14) <lb/>The analysis of fertility patterns in largely economic terms has <lb/>met with criticism from a variety of perspectives . For example, <lb/>proponents of modernization theory like Maris Vinovskis argue <lb/>that socio-economic variables, while important, are not adequate <lb/>to account for what was, after all, a general pattern of fertility <lb/>decline . Vinovskis would like to take attitudinal components of <lb/>change more seriously, and some of the support for arguments of <lb/>this sort is drawn from ethnic differentials in fertility patterns <lb/>in urban and rural areas of the U .S .(15) <lb/>The demographic study of urban populations as such has often come <lb/>out of the field of urban history rather than economics, and where <lb/>it has, is better integrated into the study of social historical <lb/>context than is often the case with the frontier studies .(16) The <lb/>study of the family in the urban American context is providing <lb/>valuable insights into the institution which is, of course, the <lb/>key to understanding demographic behavior . While there are numerous <lb/>examples of individual and small group projects concerned with urban <lb/>social, family and demographic history, it is worth noting especially <lb/>here the most exciting and promising of these -the Philadelphia <lb/>Social History Project .(17) This project, housed at the School of <lb/>Public and Urban Policy of the University of Pennsylvania and <lb/>headed by Theodore Hershberg, employs a fulltime interdisciplinary <lb/>staff as well as a large number of temporary research associates <lb/>for specific areas of expertise . The research associates are en-<lb/>gaged in genuinely interdisciplinary and collaborative work employ-<lb/>ing an enormous common data base including manuscript censuses, house-<lb/>hold surveys, manufacturing censuses, business directories and mort-<lb/>ality registers for the city of Philadelphia, all of which have been <lb/>converted to a machine-readable format . Perhaps more than any other <lb/>social historical project currently underway, the Philadelphia Pro-<lb/>ject allows and encourages a &quot;total history&quot; to be undertaken -one <lb/>which links developments in demographic, family, labor and community <lb/>history together in the context of an understanding of the evolution <lb/>of the urban space itself .(18) <lb/>There is one other area of American history for which explicit links <lb/>between economic and demographic trends have been much the focus of <lb/>study -the field of Afro-American history, both under slavery and <lb/>after Emancipation . Many of the questions and controversies current-<lb/>ly surrounding antebellum black demographic history trace their <lb/>origins to the arguments made by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman <lb/>in. Time on the Cross : the Economics of American Negro Slavery .(19) <lb/>Although there had been a number of earlier studies of black demo-<lb/>graphy and demographic history(20), it is fair to say that it was <lb/>Fogel and Engerman&apos;s study that really set the field in motion, and <lb/>has largely structured its subsequent debates . Their argument, <lb/></body>

			<page>-6 -<lb/></page>

			<body>centering as it does on an effort to prove that slavery was a pro-<lb/>fitable (and hence economically rational) system, focussed attention <lb/>on such essentially demographic issues as the viability of the slave <lb/>labor force and its ability to reproduce itself as a labor supply. <lb/>Although Time of the Cross has been rightfully criticized for its <lb/>conceptualization (especially for its attempts to compare regional <lb/>economies and labor conditions in different sections of the U .S .) <lb/>and for its sometimes dubious methodology (for example, its heroic <lb/>.assumptions and overgeneralizations from sparse data), subsequent <lb/>less grandiose and more careful researchers have felt compelled to <lb/>address the important questions raised by Fogel and Engerman . Re-<lb/>cent special issues of Southern Studies(21) and The William and <lb/>Mary Quarterly(22) attest to the strides made toward uncovering new <lb/>sources and establishing methods for their analysis which will yield <lb/>more precise estimates of slave population trends, even for the <lb/>colonial era . The relatively recent study of slave demography in <lb/>the colonial era is of particular importance, since many significant <lb/>changes in black population patterns apparently occurred before <lb/>usable census records are available . Generally cited as models of <lb/>correct methodology, the articles of Russell Menard and his col-<lb/>leagues on the Chesapeake Project sponsored by the St .Mary&apos;s City <lb/>Commission are interesting for their blend of economic, demographic <lb/>and social historical evidence drawn mainly from probate records(23). <lb/>Analyses of the records of individual plantations have also pro-<lb/>duced credible demographic evidence when carefully handled <lb/>as, for example, in articles by James Trussell and Richard <lb/>Steckel(24), Alan Kulikoff(25), and Cheryll Cody .(26) Mention should <lb/>also be made of the influential work of Herbert Gutman(27), whose <lb/>search for new sources to aid in a reconstruction of black family <lb/>patterns and family culture has been generally well-received . Gutman <lb/>has been criticized, however, for his failure to employ systematic <lb/>demographic methods and concepts even where they are, in fact, <lb/>crucial to support his argument maintaining the viability and <lb/>resilience of Afro-American family systems . His goal -to counter <lb/>both the older sociological portrait of the American black family <lb/>popularized by the Moynihan report(28), and the relatively sanguine <lb/>picture of slave family life which one might draw from Time on <lb/>the Cross -is certainly worth pursuing with utmust rigor .(29) <lb/>A whole set of characteristically American historical problem areas <lb/>-frontier society, immigration, slavery -have thus been much <lb/>illuminated, if not redefined by the introduction of a historical <lb/>demographic perspective . But these remain &quot;American&quot; problems -<lb/>despite their obvious methodological indebtedness to European <lb/>scholars, it is fair to say that most historians of the U .S . con-<lb/>duct their research in relative isolation from European histor-<lb/>ians .(30) This is naturally not the case with American demographic <lb/>historians of Europe, whose research is closely linked both <lb/>theoretically and methodologically with that of European colleagues, <lb/>and is in some cases absolutely central to the fields. <lb/>One of the earliest and best known projects involving European demo-<lb/>graphic history is the European Fertility Project headed by Ansley <lb/>Coale of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. <lb/>The demographers associated with the Project have set for themselves <lb/>the goal of &quot;recording the decline of fertility in each of the <lb/>provinces of Europe . . . from the time in each province when marital <lb/></body>

			<page>-7 -<lb/></page>

			<body>fertility was essentially constant until it reached a minimum or <lb/>until the present, if it is still declining&quot;(31) . The group has <lb/>produced a large number of articles and a series of monographs <lb/>describing the demographic transition in different regions of re-<lb/>search .(32) An important by-product of the Project has been the <lb/>creation of a series of indexes of fertility and nuptiality which <lb/>can be constructed from the kinds of data often available histor-<lb/>ically, and sets of model life tables which have been widely used <lb/>by demographic historians . Theoretically, the works restrict <lb/>themselves to a search for the relationships between fertility <lb/>decline and socio-economic change suggested by the loosely specified <lb/>&quot;demographic transition theory&quot; . But the empirical results are not <lb/>particularly supportive of generalization along these lines . As <lb/>one recent reviewer put it, &quot;we still have the old &apos;theory&apos; with <lb/>little predictive power . We now perhaps realize (as a result of <lb/>the EFP studies) even more firmly that the transition is really a <lb/>collection of variant patterns of fertility and nuptiality change <lb/>and that the relationships between demographic and socio-economic <lb/>variables are not constant or even very predictable in shape and <lb/>magnitude .&quot;(33) <lb/>The OPR studies of published census materials are by no means the <lb/>only types of research undertaken by American demographic histor-<lb/>ians of Europe . Many are working with community--level sources like <lb/>parish registers and household surveys, exploring the process of <lb/>demographic change in a fashion not possible through the analysis <lb/>of aggregate data alone . Much of the theoretical interest of <lb/>American historians, like that of their European colleagues, has <lb/>centered on the demographic character of the peasant community <lb/>and its eventual alteration under the impact of historical change. <lb/>The demographer John Knodel, in fact one of the associates on the <lb/>European Fertility Project, has also worked extensively with a <lb/>set of German village geneologies, the Ortssippenbücher, to des-<lb/>cribe what he finds to be essentially a &apos;natural fertility&apos; re-<lb/>gime throughout rural Germany until well into the 19th century .(34) <lb/>Since he is a demographer, Knodel pays relatively little attention <lb/>to the social-historical context of the populations he studies, but <lb/>his precise and careful demographic analysis of them represents a <lb/>great contribution to our understanding of central European histor-<lb/>ical demographic patterns. <lb/>Social historians concerned with demographic questions have tended <lb/>to pay more attention to context, and have attempted to enmesh de-<lb/>mographic behavior in the system of social relationships in which <lb/>it occurred . David Sabean, for example, has undertaken a massive <lb/>effort to write a &apos;total history&apos; of a set of South German commun-<lb/>ities from the 16th through the 19th centuries . He hopes to account <lb/>for important longterm changes in demographic behavior as part of <lb/>a complex evolution involving farming practices, settlement patterns, <lb/>inheritance and land tenure practices and market relations . Sabean, <lb/>in his earlier work on the era of the Peasant War, has illustrated <lb/>how much a demographic perspective can add to the analysis of long-<lb/>standing social-historical problems .(35) The connections between <lb/>the demography, family life and household structure of the peasant <lb/>community, on the one hand, and land tenure and inheritance patterns, <lb/>on the other, have also been explored in the seminal work of Lutz <lb/></body>

			<page>-8 -<lb/></page>

			<body>Berkner . Ranging in area from central France through Germany and <lb/>Austria, Berkner&apos;s research has illustrated the persistence of <lb/>&quot;stem&quot; family structures and other strategies for handling the <lb/>difficulties inherent in the effort to balance land and population <lb/>in the peasant system . Berkner has also illustrated how inheritance <lb/>customs can affect population growth .(36) Andreas Plakans has come <lb/>to consistent conclusions about land tenure and household structure <lb/>in his studies in the Baltic area, work which suggests a connection <lb/>between the complex household system common to that area and the <lb/>labor demands made by landlords as part of the condition of <lb/>tenure .(37) <lb/>One of the central debates surrounding the historical (and contempo-<lb/>rary) analysis of economic development and population change con-<lb/>cerns the origin and nature of the population rise associated with <lb/>the early stages of transition to industrial capitalism . The de-<lb/>mographic transition theory mentioned above certainly offers one <lb/>account -in simplest terms, changes associated with &apos;modernization&apos; <lb/>(health care, education etc .) bring about lowered mortality, which <lb/>in turn encourages adjustments in fertility . An alternative <lb/>theoretical tradition, one more sceptical of the supposed bene-<lb/>ficial consequences of economic modernization, emphasizes instead <lb/>the destabilizing impact of early capitalist intervention into the <lb/>peasant economy, and the demographic imbalances created through <lb/>the earlier marriage and higher fertility associated with it . This <lb/>approach pushes researchers back in time, into the early modern <lb/>&apos;proto-industrial&apos; phase of economic growth . Again, the work of <lb/>American researchers has been critical to the debate .(38) The <lb/>work of Franklin Mendels, an economic historian who compared patterns <lb/>of development in commercial agricultural and proto-industrial re-<lb/>gions of Flanders, first illustrated the demographic effect of <lb/>rural industry .(39) Other American economic historians, notably <lb/>Herbert Kisch and Richard Rudolph, have followed the route of rural <lb/>industrial development in Central Europe and Russia .(40) Certainly <lb/>much work needs to be done to make the case, but future discussion <lb/>of demographic change in rural Europe will need to take these find-<lb/>ings into account and to expand upon them. <lb/>American scholars have also been active in the area of European <lb/>urban demographic history, perhaps even more active than their <lb/>European colleagues . A few examples will serve to illustrate the <lb/>scope and results of their research . David Herlihy&apos;s work on <lb/>Renaissance Florence(41) has been rightfully called &quot;the most <lb/>successful effort so far to integrate demographic analysis with <lb/>regional social history and literary sources .&quot;(42) Allan Sharlin&apos;s <lb/>study of early modern Frankfurt combines the mastery of historical <lb/>sources with awareness of appropriate methods of analysis so <lb/>crucial to high quality demographic history .(43) Louise Tilly&apos;s <lb/>current research about women&apos;s work, family strategies and de-<lb/>mographic patterns in several northern French cities promises to <lb/>add as much to the field of urban demographic history as her <lb/>earlier collaborative work with Joan Scott added to the field of <lb/>European family and women&apos;s history .(44) James Jackson&apos;s social and <lb/>demographic analysis of industrial Duisburg has illustrated the <lb/>rich possibilities open to those willing to explore sources like <lb/>migration records, sources which illuminate the demographic patterns <lb/>and family experiences associated with early industrial urban-<lb/></body>

			<body>ization .(45) Urban-rural comparisons from analyses of published <lb/>census statistics by Michael Haines(46) and John Knodel and Mary <lb/>Jo Maynes(47), call into question some pervasive assumptions about <lb/>the demographic history of the nineteenth-century, especially about <lb/>the demographic behavior of &apos;modern&apos; sectors . The results of these <lb/>various studies are by no means entirely consistent and these new <lb/>empirical contributions leave many theoretical questions unresolved. <lb/>But, as in the case of U .S . urban demographic history, the mesh of <lb/>theoretical concern, generally careful methodology, and creative <lb/>use of sources represented by the best of these studies, makes <lb/>American work in the field of European urban social and demographic <lb/>history especially significant. <lb/>No essay about the study of demographic history in the United States <lb/>would be complete without some mention of the handful of social <lb/>scientists who have, often in addition to their empirical work, <lb/>furthered the field through conceptual and theoretical writings, <lb/>critical discussions and evaluations of historical demographic li-<lb/>terature and methodological advances . Charles Tilly&apos;s main empirical <lb/>concern with demography centers on the question of the components <lb/>of the process of proletarianization, but he has, in a few important <lb/>essays, also synthesized large bodies of social and demographic <lb/>historical writing and suggested hypotheses about demographic change <lb/>which have served as guideposts for others engaged in research .(48) <lb/>The &apos;neo-Malthusian &apos; economist Ron Lee has developed techniques for <lb/>improving the nature of information derived from aggregative analysis <lb/>of parish registers, especially spectral analysis for use in de-<lb/>tecting cycles in demographic trends and in their relationships to <lb/>other series data .(49) Allan Sharlin is establishing himself as <lb/>one of the foremost U .S . students and proponents of sound historical <lb/>demographic techniques, and has contributed methodologically and <lb/>conceptually to some specific research problem <lb/>areas.(50) Daniel <lb/>Scott Smith(51), Maris Vinovskis(52), and Lutz Berkner(53), have all <lb/>written thoughtful assessments and critical evaluations of sub-<lb/>stantial bodies of historical demographic literature, essays which <lb/>have helped to point out difficulties in published research, and <lb/>to improve the designs and techniques of later studies . Berkner <lb/>has also been important in the development of a process-oriented, <lb/>or life-cycle perspective on family history . He originally pre-<lb/>sented his thoughts on this subject in his analysis of Austrian <lb/>peasant households and in his criticism of the work of Peter Laslett <lb/>and associates .(54) The life-cycle perspective has also become cen-<lb/>tral to the conceptualization of demographic problems characteristic <lb/>of many social historians of the U .S . like Tamara Hareven and her <lb/>associates, who draw some of their inspiration from American <lb/>sociologists of the family(55), and help to integrate some of their <lb/>insights into historical work. <lb/>Part of the explanation for the strides made in and more central <lb/>role of historical demographic study in the United States (even . <lb/>though the persistence of problems in the field and resistance in <lb/>some circles to its acceptance cannot be denied) is the emergence <lb/>of a number of centers where group projects are in progress, where <lb/>training of students in historical demographic techniques takes <lb/>place, or where concentrations of individual researchers are large <lb/>enough to establish an intellectual atmosphere conducive to this <lb/></body>

			<page>-10 -<lb/></page>

			<body>type of work . The most active of these centers are probably the <lb/>Office of Population Research of Princeton University (home of the <lb/>European Fertility Project), The Population Studies Center of the <lb/>University of Pennsylvania (some of whose members are affiliated <lb/>with the Philadelphia Social History Project), the Population <lb/>Studies Center of the University of Michigan, the Center for Histor-<lb/>ical Population Studies of the University of Utah, and the Newberry <lb/>Library in Chicago . The Utah Center is the only one in the U .S. <lb/>founded with the express aim of promoting research in historical <lb/>population studies ; the other demographic centers mentioned encourage <lb/>historical projects along with a variety of other types of demo-<lb/>graphic analysis . The prime function to date of the Center for <lb/>Historical Population Studies has been to facilitate scholarly <lb/>access to the mammoth collection of demographic records collected <lb/>in the archives of the Geneological Society of Utah .(56) Re-<lb/>seatchers have already begun to find these collections useful, <lb/>and a number of projects have been undertaken to exploit them -<lb/>for example, the Mormon Demography Project which is examining <lb/>patterns of marriage, fertility, mortality and migration among <lb/>Utah Mormons over the last 125 years ;(57) and a project entitled <lb/>&quot;The Economics of Mortality in North America, 1650-1910&quot;(58), <lb/>which is assembling a data base of census, geneological, probate <lb/>and tax records for a proposed examination of regional and ethnic <lb/>mortality differentials, and associations between socio-economic <lb/>variables and mortality . The role of the Family and Community <lb/>History Center of the Newberry Library is somewhat different. <lb/>This Center is particularly important as a training grounds for <lb/>social historians -the annual Summer Institutes in Quantitative <lb/>History provide training in statistics, research design, com <lb/>puting, demography and family history in addition to workshops on <lb/>a variety of social historical topics . The Library also has a good <lb/>collection of source materials including geneologies and local <lb/>histories for American and English communities, and provides some <lb/>fellowship support for scholars working with these sources . Current <lb/>research projects include Daniel Scott Smith&apos;s study of the older <lb/>population of the United States(S9) and Barbara Hanawalt&apos;s study <lb/>of the late medieval peasant family in England . The Library also <lb/>houses the Center for the History of the American Indian, which <lb/>has began to support a small number of demographic projects. <lb/>Perhaps even more encouraging is the fact that most major departments <lb/>of history now feel obliged to have on their staff at least one <lb/>historian with demographic training or research interests . Thus <lb/>even where no formal training in demographic historical methods is <lb/>offered, the perspective is nonetheless available to students . Some <lb/>departments, those of Michigan and Minnesota, for example, have <lb/>by design or chance even assembled clusters of scholars engaged in <lb/>research on family and demographic history . These examples are <lb/>certainly atypical, but it is safe to say that, current university <lb/>budgetary crises and hiring freezes notwithstanding, demographic <lb/>historians have managed to establish themselves in academe, and <lb/>to incorporate their perspective into many of the major intellectual <lb/>debates of contemporary American historical and social scientific <lb/>disciplines -an impressive record for a first generation . <lb/></body>

As for the U .S . origins of demo-<lb/>graphic historical study, Michael Gordon, editor of two volumes of <lb/>articles on American family history, both entitled The American <lb/>Family in Social Historical Perspective (New York, 1973 1 and 1978 2 ), <lb/>claims in the introduction to the second edition that it was the <lb/>U .S . publication of Peter Laslett&apos;s The World We Have Lost, in <lb/>1965, that inspired many of the subsequent U .S . community studies <lb/>employing demographic historical techniques . Kenneth Lockridge, <lb/>one of the American pioneers in the field, recalls that it was <lb/>the work of Pierre Goubert which inspired his own . See K . Lock-<lb/>ridge, &quot;Historical Demography&quot;, in C .F . Delzell, ed ., The Future <lb/>of History (Nashville, Tenn ., 1977). <lb/>2 For a description in German of simultaneous developments in the <lb/>broader area of social history in the United States, see J. <lb/>Modell, &quot;Die &apos;Neue Sozialgeschichte&apos; in Amerika&quot;, Geschichte and <lb/>Gesellschaft 1 (1975), 155-170. <lb/>3 A recent bibliography published under the auspices of the Journal <lb/>of Family History, G . Soliday&apos;s History of the Family and Kin-<lb/>ship : A Select International Bibliography (Millwood, N .Y ., 1980) <lb/>gives some indication of the extent of American contribution to <lb/>historical demographic research. <lb/>4 The demographic history of Native American people, it should be <lb/>noted, has been of less concern to historians, and only recently <lb/>has substantial attention begun to be paid to it .

			<listBibl>28 The debate generated by the Moynihan Report in the 1960s, between <lb/>those who regarded the black family as weakened by the historical <lb/>experience of American blacks, and those who preferred to emphasize <lb/>its strength and adaptability, illustrates the connections between <lb/>policy and social and historical research that has characterized <lb/>the study of black population . See L . Rainwater and W .L . Yancey, <lb/>(eds .), The Moynihan Report and the Politics of Controversy <lb/>(Cambridge, Mass ., 1967). <lb/>29 For some methodological critiques, see R .

Several current projects come to <lb/>mind -the comparative studies of Kenneth Lockridge and Daniel <lb/>Scott Smith which look at European and North American demographic <lb/>patterns, the work of Kathy Conzen comparing German families in <lb/>Germany and the United States, the new efforts of historians of <lb/>American slavery to view the system as part of a world economy. <lb/>With the exception of the already cited article by Smith (Note <lb/>10), so far there has been little published in the way of com-<lb/>parative work of this sort. <lb/>31 A .J .
