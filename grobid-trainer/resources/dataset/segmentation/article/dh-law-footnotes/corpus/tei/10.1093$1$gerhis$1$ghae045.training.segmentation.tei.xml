      <body>As a global conflict, the Second World War severely disrupted worldwide economic, <lb/>socio-cultural, political and strategic dynamics. The war directly affected the belli-<lb/>gerent and occupied countries, but it also left a significant mark on strategic neutral <lb/>territories such as Spain. Although Francisco Franco declared Spain neutral at the be-<lb/>ginning of the conflict, his leanings towards the Axis side and his subsequent declar-<lb/>ation of non-belligerence, rather than strict neutrality, made Spain, its colonies and its <lb/>archipelagos alternative theatres for the conflict. <lb/>During the Second World War, the Canary Islands were a focus of foreign interest. <lb/>Not only did the belligerent powers consider the islands in their military planning, but <lb/>the archipelago also had a leading role in diplomatic manoeuvres, naval operations, <lb/>commercial and navigation blockades, oil rationing campaigns, persuasive activities <lb/>and, above all, intelligence and counterintelligence campaigns. In particular, the Third <lb/>Reich deployed a careful clandestine activity both in the Canary Islands and in the <lb/>north-western African strip for the protection of German submarines in the Atlantic <lb/>and in support of smuggling, surveillance, sabotage and subversion. <lb/>Many scholars of war intelligence have explored the impact of espionage, intelli-<lb/>gence, sabotage and counterintelligence activities during the Second World War. Studies <lb/>of German intelligence services (political, military and naval) have been illuminating, <lb/>but as yet there are few studies of the relationship between German intelligence, naval <lb/>operations and port supplies. 1 Moreover, there is still room to research the German <lb/>intelligence campaign in North Africa and the Atlantic, the implications for the war <lb/>of German consular authorities abroad and the participation of foreign German com-<lb/>munities in wartime intelligence activities. 2 Publications on German intelligence in <lb/></body>

    <body>occupied and Allied territories have been particularly revealing, but although studies of <lb/>German intelligence and espionage in neutral locations have recently increased, they <lb/>do not yet have the same standing. 3 <lb/>Recent research on foreign intelligence in Spain during the Second World War has <lb/>largely been devoted to the study of Allied intelligence, but the activity of German <lb/>intelligence in the interior and north of the Iberian peninsula has certainly not been <lb/>ignored. 4 These works emphasize, for example, the strategic importance of the Franco-<lb/>Spanish border and the dynamism of the ports located in the Basque Country and <lb/>Galicia, as well as the role played by Spanish evacuation networks and smuggling oper-<lb/>ations that connected the north of Spain with Latin America. However, there remains <lb/>room for further research, especially in relation to other strategic areas such as the south <lb/>of the country, the Spanish archipelagos and the Spanish enclaves in Africa. <lb/>In the case of the Canary Islands, scholars have analysed the strategic importance <lb/>of the Atlantic archipelago during the war principally in relation to Allied occupation <lb/>and sabotage plans. 5 Additionally, some works have analysed the role played by Allied <lb/>operational reports on the islands, which considered the islands tactically for military <lb/>purposes. 6 Naval movements deployed by Germany, especially through port supplies <lb/></body>

    <body>organized from the archipelago, have also garnered attention. 7 Recent studies note the <lb/>role played by the German community in the Canary Islands during the war, exploring <lb/>the impact of Nazism on the archipelago. 8 German intelligence, especially in relation <lb/>to naval supply activities, espionage operations, and political surveillance, has not yet re-<lb/>ceived similar treatment. This article considers the role played by German intelligence in <lb/>the Canary Islands as a case study of wartime intelligence operations in the mid-Atlantic <lb/>during the Second World War. It analyses leading agencies and agents, their objectives <lb/>and their networks. The study also examines the Allied monitoring of the German intel-<lb/>ligence campaigns and the dismantling of the Third Reich&apos;s secret services after the war. <lb/>I. German Intelligence and Its Intervention in Spain <lb/>The clandestine activities of the Third Reich were conducted on the front lines and <lb/>home front but also extended to Allied, occupied and neutral territories, including <lb/>Spain. The Abwehr, literally &apos;defence&apos;, the intelligence agency of the Armed Forces High <lb/>Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW) was responsible for military intelligence, <lb/>sabotage, espionage and counterintelligence. Directly subordinate to the Armed Forces <lb/>High Command, the Abwehr was one of the main German intelligence agencies. 9 After <lb/>the summer of 1944, the organization was absorbed into the Reich police and security <lb/>agencies and was under the SS Intelligence and Security Service (Amt VI/Sicherheitsdienst, <lb/>SD), a security and political intelligence service of the Nazi Party created in 1931 that <lb/>had been integrated into the Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, RSHA) <lb/>in 1939. The SD had been regularly competing with Heinrich Himmler&apos;s Security <lb/>Police (Sicherheitspolizei, SiPo), a state police agency that absorbed the police forces of the <lb/>Gestapo from 1936 and had been integrated into the RSHA in 1939. The term &apos;SiPo&apos; <lb/>continued to be generally used to describe any police force that was part of the RSHA, <lb/>and, in fact, the organization always managed to maintain significant independence <lb/>within the security office. 10 The Third Reich also activated military intelligence units <lb/>within each of the services, the Wehrmacht, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. Thus, for <lb/>example, the Secret Supply Service of the German Navy, known as the Etappendienst, or <lb/>Etappenorganisation, also carried out intelligence work. 11 <lb/></body>

    <body>Spain was a prominent target of intelligence and espionage campaigns carried out <lb/>by the Third Reich between 1939 and 1945. These not only received the collabor-<lb/>ation of a long-standing German community established in the country since the mid-<lb/>nineteenth century but also benefited from the growth of Nazism in Spain during the <lb/>1930s and the cooperation of the Franco regime after its victory in the Spanish Civil <lb/>War. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the support of the Third Reich for <lb/>Franco had further paved the way for the Nazi infiltration of Spain and laid the founda-<lb/>tions for Spanish-German collaboration during the Second World War. 12 The actions <lb/>of the Gestapo in Spain received a significant boost from 1936, especially with the ap-<lb/>pointment of Paul Winzer as police attaché to the German embassy in Madrid. The <lb/>Gestapo operated through a subsidiary organization known as the Harbour Service <lb/>(Hafendienst), which sought to monitor and control German citizens and businesses in <lb/>the country. 13 <lb/>The strategic revaluation of Spain and its islands from 1939 turned the Spanish <lb/>territory into an active alternative theatre of the Second World War. Although Franco <lb/>decreed Spanish neutrality with the outbreak of war, his support of the Axis was more <lb/>than evident, at least until 1943. Spain modified its war stance in June 1940, adopting <lb/>a position of non-belligerence that allowed it to continue offering some support to the <lb/>Axis without losing its neutral status. Spanish-German negotiations-carried out, for <lb/>example, during the trips made by the Spanish minister Ramón Serrano Suñer to Berlin <lb/>between 1940 and 1941 and the meeting between Franco and Hitler in Hendaye in <lb/>October 1941-reinforced Spain&apos;s belligerent attitude, although they did not produce <lb/>a definitive date for Spanish military involvement. Despite Spain&apos;s distancing itself from <lb/>direct participation in the war, it was an active collaborator, as was evident in its co-<lb/>operation with Axis trade operations, port supplies, intelligence and propaganda and its <lb/>dispatch in mid-1941 of the Blue Division to fight against the Soviet Union. 14 <lb/>During the global war, the Nazi Party Foreign Organization (NSDAP Auslands-<lb/>Organisation, NSDAP/AO) in Spain extended its influence over the German community <lb/>established in the country. 15 The Third Reich police forces collaborated directly with <lb/>Franco&apos;s forces, especially after October 1940. 16 The Third Reich&apos;s diplomatic mission <lb/>in Spain directed its wartime contribution through the activities of military and press <lb/>attachés, which complemented the involvement of consuls and intelligence agents. <lb/>The Abwehr detachment in Spain (Kriegsorganisation Spanien, KO-Spanien) was one of the <lb/>largest of such groups. 17 It was led by Captain Gustav Leissner, who acted under the <lb/>alias &apos;Lenz&apos;, from 1939 until May 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Arno Kleienstueber <lb/></body>

      <body>replaced him. 18 KO-Spanien was made up of three subdivisions, known as Gruppen or <lb/>Abteilungen. The first was an espionage section, Section I (Ab-I), which was controlled <lb/>by Colonel Eberhard Kieckebusch and divided into specialized subsections. One of the <lb/>main subdivisions was the naval intelligence section (Ab-I Marine, or Ab-I-M), which <lb/>controlled subsidiary offices in Barcelona, Valencia, Cartagena, Malaga, Algeciras, <lb/>Cádiz, Seville, Huelva, Vigo, La Coruña, Bilbao, Gijón, Tenerife and Las Palmas. 19 <lb/>The military intelligence subdivision (Ab-I Heer, or Ab-I-H), directed by Kieckebusch <lb/>and assisted by Joachim Canaris, gathered information on Allied troops and military <lb/>units, armaments and strategic plans. The espionage section was made up of subdivi-<lb/>sions for air intelligence (Ab-I-Luftwaffe, or Ab-I-L), communications (Ab-I-i-W/T), <lb/>financial information (Ab-I-W), forgery (Ab-I-G) and photographic services (Ab-I-F). 20 <lb/>Section II (Ab-II) of KO-Spanien was the sabotage section, which planned and executed <lb/>sabotage against Allied vessels and facilities in both Spain and Morocco, but also sought <lb/>to establish contacts with Moroccan nationalists in the Spanish Protectorate. The cen-<lb/>tral office of the sabotage section in Madrid was made up of a large staff that in-<lb/>cluded secretary Liselotte Niemann (also known as Lilo Nehrkorn, her original last <lb/>name), the daughter of the leading intelligence agent in the Canary Islands, Edmund <lb/>(Nehrkorn) Niemann. 21 Section III (Ab-III) of KO-Spanien was a counterintelligence <lb/>section, dedicated to espionage and disinformation under the leadership of figures such <lb/>as Colonel Kurt von Rohrscheidt. This section enjoyed close collaboration with the <lb/>Franco regime&apos;s General Directorate of Security (Dirección General de Seguridad, DGS). 22 <lb/>KO-Spanien organized its campaigns from its headquarters in the German Embassy in <lb/>Madrid. 23 It had regional branches (Nebenstellen) that were located mainly in San Sebastián, <lb/>Barcelona, Madrid, Algeciras, Spanish Morocco and Las Palmas-the last of these with a <lb/>substation in Tenerife. 24 However, the branches in the Canary Islands had relative inde-<lb/>pendence and, according to US agents, their campaigns were especially active. 25 <lb/>Its position near the border between Spain and German-occupied France gave the San <lb/>Sebastián office a particular role. Under the command of Karl Fritz Furch (alias &apos;Fuente&apos;), <lb/>it dealt primarily with the transit of Abwehr personnel across the border. 26 The headquar-<lb/>ters of the Abwehr in Spanish Morocco were established in Tetouan and were under the <lb/>control of Hans Joachin Rudolf (aliases &apos;Juan Recke&apos;, &apos;Moruno&apos;, &apos;Kalif &apos; and &apos;Mueller&apos;). 27 <lb/></body>

    <body>The office supervised the activities of subsidiary stations such as those in Tangier, Melilla, <lb/>Cape Spartel and Ceuta. 28 German activity in the Spanish Sahara was particularly sig-<lb/>nificant, especially in Villa Cisneros (Río de Oro). This area was under both KO-Spanien <lb/>and the Abwehr in Paris. In Villa Cisneros, German intelligence was controlled through <lb/>the figure of Pablo López Cantaro (alias &apos;Pila&apos; and &apos;Don Pablo&apos;), a cover name that prob-<lb/>ably hid his German nationality. Don Pablo established an important network of Spanish, <lb/>German and Arab agents who facilitated the collection of information and the develop-<lb/>ment of radiotelegraphic operations. 29 <lb/>KO-Spanien also had independent work groups (known as Büros) that carried out <lb/>specific missions-Recke, Runde, Zimmerschied, van Veersen, Seidel, Bodden and Plankert. 30 <lb/>Büro Plankert, which was directed by Heinz Plankert, was a military radio moni-<lb/>toring and interception service of the Wehrmacht High Command Communications <lb/>Department in Berlin (OKW/WNV/Chi), under the official name Weather Service <lb/>(Wetterbeobachtungstelle). It was responsible for capturing and deciphering Allied radio <lb/>messages, both military and diplomatic, by monitoring fixed stations in France and <lb/>Allied stations in North Africa as well as Anglo-American naval and diplomatic traffic <lb/>between countries. The service, which was to serve all branches of the German armed <lb/>forces, had three main areas of operation, in Madrid, Seville and Las Palmas, but <lb/>also established other offices and secondary listening stations in Barcelona, Vigo and <lb/>Valencia. 31 <lb/>Some of the Abwehr subdivisions in Germany also carried out work in Spain. For <lb/>example, Abwehrstelle (Ast) Hamburg and its subsidiary branches (Nebenstellen, Nest) in <lb/>Bremen and Kiel controlled a small network of independent agents in Spain. 32 The <lb/>Iberian country was also used to train intelligence agents who were dispatched to the <lb/>British Isles, the United States and South America. To send their intelligence reports <lb/>from their respective destinations, they were forced to use the regular postal service as <lb/>well as employ techniques such as invisible writing. These agents were assigned cover <lb/>postal addresses in Spain and Portugal. Another method of communication involved <lb/>secret messengers carried by Spanish merchant ships, especially those sailing to and <lb/>from South America. 33 After the reorganization of the Abwehr in June 1944, the name <lb/>KO-Spanien was replaced by Kommando des Meldegebietes (KdM). 34 <lb/>The Germans also deployed significant naval intelligence in Spain that emanated <lb/>from the Etappendienst, which collaborated with the Abwehr. The naval organization <lb/>operated in regional areas such as the Grossetappe Spanien-Portugal (literally, &apos;large sta-<lb/>ging zone Spain and Portugal&apos;), which Juan José Díaz Benítez has identified as one of <lb/></body>

      <body>the most active supply services during the Second World War, in light, in particular, <lb/>of the collection of strategic information for submarine supplying and the support <lb/>of economic warfare, especially in coastal and strategic territories. The work of the <lb/>Etappendienst in Spain was channelled through various agents: naval attachés, middle <lb/>managers, known as &apos;L (BE)&apos;, trusted agents who collected strategic information and <lb/>coordinated supply activities, referred to as Vertrauensmänner or &apos;Vm (BE)&apos;, and, finally, <lb/>informants. 35 <lb/>II. The Canary Islands: An Alternative Battleground in the <lb/>Mid-Atlantic <lb/>Located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, south-west of Spain, north-west of Africa <lb/>and off the coast of Morocco, the Canary Islands have frequently been a frontier terri-<lb/>tory connected with international events, especially from the second half of the nine-<lb/>teenth century. Foreign capital, mainly British and German, contributed considerably <lb/>to the development of the islands&apos; ports. For example, British companies such as Cory <lb/>Brothers, Miller &amp; Co., and Elder Dempster played a significant part in the islands&apos; <lb/>history. Although the British firms had a greater role, German companies also had a <lb/>presence in the archipelago, with Woermann Linie and the Deutsche Kohlen Depot <lb/>Gesellschaft, for example. 36 The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 increased the <lb/>value of the Canary Islands, but also heightened their dependency and vulnerability. <lb/>The German submarine war reached the archipelago at the beginning of the conflict, <lb/>together with the Allied blockade in response. 37 <lb/>Between 1939 and 1945, the islands were indirectly protagonists in a global conflict <lb/>through intelligence and propaganda activities, naval movements and the planning of <lb/>foreign campaigns. 38 In addition to unsuccessfully requesting the cession of one of the <lb/>islands in 1940, Germany used the Atlantic archipelago in naval operations, especially <lb/>between 1940 and 1943. German ships and tankers found refuge in Canary Islands <lb/>ports before continuing their passages on to the Third Reich and occupied France. A <lb/>second group of ships remained in the archipelago, especially between 1940 and 1941, <lb/>in the service of the Etappendienst&apos;s Etappe Kanaren, which was responsible for the supply <lb/>service in the Canary Islands. The Etappe Kanaren had been established before the out-<lb/>break of the First World War but was dissolved after the end of that global conflict. <lb/>According to Díaz Benítez, its reconstruction began in 1930, as part of the Abwehr, and <lb/>in June 1938 it was transferred to the armed forces intelligence office of the Wehrmacht <lb/></body>

        <body>High Command (OKW/Ausl.), where it remained until July 1944, when it came dir-<lb/>ectly under the Kriegsmarine. 39 <lb/>Some of the vessels docked in Canarian ports during the war were used to supply <lb/>auxiliary cruisers in the Atlantic, and two of them, the Corrientes and the Kersten Miles, <lb/>remained at the islands until the end of the war. Corrientes carried out five refuelling op-<lb/>erations between March and July 1941. 40 The Etappendienst even organized the direct <lb/>supply of fuel and food to Nazi submarines in one of the Canary Islands harbours, the <lb/>Port of La Luz (Las Palmas). <lb/>Britain also recognized how the archipelago might aid its military activities. In the <lb/>event of the loss of Gibraltar, a succession of secret invasion and occupation plans, such <lb/>as operations Chutney, Puma, Pilgrim, Adroit and Tonic, would exploit the potential of the <lb/>islands as a naval base. 41 Unlike its British ally, the United States did not contemplate a <lb/>direct invasion of the Canary Islands, but it did not discount their significance and they <lb/>remained a prominent objective of American pressure, diplomacy and intelligence. 42 <lb/>Allied intelligence on the Canary Islands was progressively organized to aid Allied <lb/>military and strategic campaigns and hinder German influence in the islands. Britain <lb/>mobilized all its intelligence services in the archipelago, from the Naval Intelligence <lb/>Division to the Secret Intelligence Service and Special Operations Executive. The <lb/>British compiled operational reports and volumes such as the ISIS Report on the Canary <lb/>Islands, produced by the Naval Intelligence Division&apos;s Section 6, also known as the <lb/>Interservice Topographical Department, between 1941 and 1942. 43 British intelligence <lb/>directed part of its efforts at the decryption of enemy messages and observing German <lb/>supply activities in the Port of La Luz. In 1941 the Naval Intelligence Division and <lb/>the Special Operations Executive designed Operation Warden, a sabotage plan for the <lb/>destruction of Axis ships anchored in that Canarian port. Although the plan was never <lb/>executed, its existence highlights the strategic importance of the Canary Islands and <lb/>the active involvement of British intelligence services. 44 <lb/>The US intelligence campaign in the Canaries was not established until late 1942, <lb/>almost a year after the United States entered the war. However, American strategic <lb/>involvement on the islands gradually grew during the second half of the conflict, cul-<lb/>minating in the almost undisputed leadership of the United States in Allied intelligence <lb/>on the Canary Islands. The US intelligence mission included a major oil rationing and <lb/>control campaign, accompanied by monitoring of the enemy&apos;s port communications <lb/>and smuggling system. 45 From 1943, the Allies undertook a counterintelligence cam-<lb/>paign on the islands that was aimed in particular at unmasking Nazism and German <lb/>intelligence agencies on the islands. <lb/></body>

    <body>Germany&apos;s intelligence, counterintelligence, sabotage and subversive activities on <lb/>the Canary Islands undertook secret operations that were often connected to Río de <lb/>Oro, Cabo Juby and Ifni in Spanish Sahara. These clandestine campaigns were aided <lb/>by the size of the German community on the islands since the nineteenth century, the <lb/>infiltration of the Nazi regime in the archipelago during the 1930s and subsequent col-<lb/>lusion and collaboration with the Francoist authorities. Studies have estimated that the <lb/>German community in the Canary Islands comprised around 400 people, who lived <lb/>throughout the islands but principally on Gran Canaria and Tenerife. The community <lb/>was integrated into Spanish society, and its members were active in a range of profes-<lb/>sions and trades, including commerce, insurance, teaching, transport, port supply, hos-<lb/>pitality and restaurants. However, they also maintained links with their German roots <lb/>through economic and socio-cultural organizations such as German clubs, associations, <lb/>schools and companies. A section of the community certainly exercised socio-cultural, <lb/>political and military influence not only in German circles but also in Spanish circles, <lb/>especially after the establishment of the Franco regime. <lb/>Although a significant part of the German community neither contributed to the <lb/>German war effort nor shared the ideals of National Socialism, both the Third Reich <lb/>and international warfare were a reality in the Canary Islands. Germany&apos;s ties to the <lb/>islands and the popularity of Nazism among the German community were evident <lb/>from the rapid establishment of local Nazi Party groups as early as 1932, the systematic <lb/>mobilization of the German colony at the service of the Third Reich, the extension <lb/>of socio-cultural activities, electoral support for Nazism, and its significant number <lb/>of affiliates. 46 The Second World War affected the German community residing in <lb/>the Canary Islands by reinforcing ideological ties to Nazism, encouraging patriotism <lb/>and propaganda campaigns, and bringing about intelligence and counterintelligence <lb/>activities. <lb/>III. German Intelligence in the Canary Islands <lb/>The intelligence networks deployed by the Third Reich in the Canary Islands pursued <lb/>four main objectives: collecting strategic information that would guarantee supply op-<lb/>erations; monitoring naval and strategic movements by the Allies on the islands and in <lb/>the Atlantic; operating information-and material-smuggling networks between South <lb/>America, the Canary Islands and the Iberian Peninsula; and preparing sabotage ac-<lb/>tivities against Allied vessels and the organization of subversive movements in French <lb/>North Africa. 47 <lb/>The strategic and clandestine missions of the Third Reich in the Canary Islands <lb/>were overseen by a variety of authorities. Consular and diplomatic bodies were al-<lb/>ready in place on the islands, especially in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, La Orotava and <lb/>Las Palmas. During the war, the German consular corps was principally made up of <lb/>influential German citizens who held honorary posts. In Las Palmas, the consular <lb/></body>

      <body>mission was represented by Consul Walter Sauermann and Vice-Consul Harald <lb/>Flick. 48 In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the consulate was overseen by a well-known <lb/>German citizen, Jacob Ahlers, who had held the position since 1905, along with <lb/>Vice-Consul Ernst Albert Groth. Both men appear to have been carrying out intelli-<lb/>gence activities since the First World War, including during the Spanish Civil War. 49 <lb/>Germany also mobilized three interconnected intelligence branches to create (1) a <lb/>military intelligence network derived from the Etappe Kanaren of the Etappendienst, (2) <lb/>an intelligence organization and clandestine monitoring station linked to the Abwehr, <lb/>and (3) surveillance campaigns run by the German political and police intelligence <lb/>agencies. <lb/>Naval intelligence connected to the Etappe Kanaren was involved in collecting strategic <lb/>information that supported the supplying of submarines and economic warfare. The <lb/>Etappe Kanaren, which had been in operation long before the outbreak of the Second <lb/>World War, mainly employed diplomatic agents, technicians and influential figures from <lb/>the Canary Islands. The intermediate leader, termed &apos;L (BE)&apos;, of the Etappe Kanaren in <lb/>1938 was Jacob Ahlers, whom we have already encountered as honorary consul at <lb/>Santa Cruz de Tenerife. His business, in which he represented German shipping com-<lb/>panies and participated in the banking sector, was significant in the archipelago. He <lb/>had ample experience in naval supply, including involvement in the supply of German <lb/>auxiliary cruisers during the First World War, and also economic and social influence <lb/>on the islands. Such was his importance to the Etappendienst that he regularly gained <lb/>the support of the German High Command of the Navy (OKM) in his disagreements <lb/>with the local head of the Nazi Party on the island, who was also his business rival. In <lb/>April 1939, Wilhelm Rahn, an employee of Ahlers and another significant figure in <lb/>the German community in Tenerife, became L (BE), a role that he held until the end <lb/>of the war. 50 <lb/>In Las Palmas, the Etappendienst acted through the shipping company Woermann <lb/>Linie, in particular through its director, Walter Vogel, and his employees Alfred Oehrens <lb/>and Johann von Thun, who served as Vertrauensmänner. Other members of the organiza-<lb/>tion were the radio operator Herbert Mertens in Tenerife and the honorary consul in <lb/>Las Palmas, Walter Sauermann, who was recruited as Vm (BE) in 1942.

    <body>head of Deutsche Lufthansa in the Canary Islands and head of the Nazi Party in Las <lb/>Palmas during the war, also functioned as Vm (BE). 51 <lb/>The supplying of submarines carried out from the islands was recognized by the <lb/>German Navy. The military chief of Grossetappe Spanien, who was the naval attaché in <lb/>Madrid, requested in March 1941 that War Merit Crosses 2nd Class be awarded to <lb/>three officers of the steamship Corrientes. He also requested this honour be given to <lb/>the agents of the Etappendienst Walter Vogel, Alfred Öehrens and Johann von Thun, <lb/>in recognition of their contribution to supplying carried out in La Luz in March <lb/>1941. 52 <lb/>In addition to guaranteeing and preparing the supply operations for German sub-<lb/>marines, one of the many tasks carried out by Etappendienst agents was surveillance of <lb/>enemy shipping around the islands. The consuls, German agents and regular inform-<lb/>ants in the service of the Etappe Kanaren were aided by the Spanish port authorities. For <lb/>example, the day after the British collier Empire Darwin left the Port of Santa Cruz de <lb/>Tenerife in May 1944, Ahlers contacted the commander of the port, Captain Arriaga, <lb/>who passed on to him all available information about the ship. 53 The Etappendienst also <lb/>received and transmitted clandestine information by radio and by hand: some of the <lb/>German intelligence agents had shortwave radio sets and could also receive and send <lb/>information via Spanish merchant ships. 54 Ahlers and German agents picked up a lea-<lb/>ther suitcase full of documents that had been taken from the Monte Inchorta, which had <lb/>arrived at Tenerife from Buenos Aires on the night of 6 July 1944. 55 Spanish mer-<lb/>chant ships that arrived at the Canary Islands reported possible enemy sightings to the <lb/>Germans through the office of the captain of the Spanish port. The stations of the <lb/>Spanish Coast Guard in the Canary Islands and at Ifni and Río de Oro were also used <lb/>for this purpose, and information was also provided by Spanish fishing boats. 56 Even <lb/>before the outbreak of the war, the German navy had secured the direct collaboration <lb/>of Deutsche Lufthansa and Spanish military aviation, which offered air services to sup-<lb/>port strategy and intelligence in the archipelago, primarily through the figure of Otto <lb/>Bertram. 57 <lb/>The Third Reich established a complex intelligence, counterintelligence and sabo-<lb/>tage network dependent on the Abwehr that stretched from the Canary Islands to Ifni, <lb/>Cabo Juby and Río de Oro. According to Allied records, the network comprised thirty-<lb/>six German residents on the islands and in North Africa and about thirty-five Spanish <lb/>citizens. The network was led by Edmund Niemann (born Nehrkorn), head of the Las <lb/>Palmas KO-Spanien section. Nehrkorn, known by the Allies as &apos;Edmund Niemann&apos;, was <lb/>born on 16 January 1886 in Lüneburg. As a leading figure in the German commu-<lb/>nity in the Canary Islands during the war, he exercised significant social and strategic <lb/></body>

    <body>influence. 58 By March 1941, he had already been listed by the FBI as a suspicious <lb/>person and possible intelligence agent in the Canary Islands. 59 He was always a direct <lb/>target of Allied counterintelligence on the islands involving the French, British and <lb/>Americans. 60 <lb/>Niemann had arrived in Las Palmas in 1939 after a long career in Morocco. He had <lb/>resided in the African territory since 1907, together with his uncle-by-marriage Carl <lb/>Ficke, a prominent merchant and businessman who had been in Morocco since 1899. <lb/>During the First World War, Ficke and Niemann had been imprisoned in French Africa <lb/>for inciting rebellion to drive the French out of Morocco. 61 Niemann was pardoned, <lb/>and on his return to Germany in November 1916 he offered the German govern-<lb/>ment his autobiographical book Die Hölle von Casablanca as a propaganda tool. 62 From <lb/>1925, he served as a director of the Mercator-Orloff Company, a colonial and com-<lb/>mercial business based in Bremen that traded with Morocco. In 1932, Niemann en-<lb/>tered the world of cinematography as the assistant director of AaFa-Film AG, a leading <lb/>German silent-film company. 63 During the Spanish Civil War, he was a colonel in the <lb/>German army and provided the Spanish Nationalist forces with significant support, <lb/>which continued after the fratricidal war. Shortly before the end of the Spanish conflict, <lb/>he opened in Ifni an establishment for the sale of cameras and lamps that is thought to <lb/>have continued to operate throughout the Second World War. In 1939, he arrived in <lb/>Las Palmas as a typewriter salesman. However, under the alias &apos;Nemo&apos;, Niemann was <lb/>responsible for coordinating the different sections of the Abwehr in the Canary Islands. <lb/>His organization sought to collect and transmit regular information on Allied move-<lb/>ments at sea and on operations carried out by Anglo-American troops in the French <lb/>territories of Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania and in areas adjacent to Río de Oro. In <lb/>addition to monitoring the enemy and anticipating its movements, the network&apos;s main <lb/>objective was the protection and organization of the supply of German submarines <lb/>and cruisers in the Atlantic, carried out in collaboration with the Etappendienst. 64 <lb/></body>

    <body>French counterintelligence agents also linked Niemann to the passage of refugees <lb/>across the Hendaye border. 65 One of the hypotheses considered by the Allies was that <lb/>&apos;Nemo&apos; could have arrived at the German intelligence post in Hendaye in February <lb/>1943 to hold secret meetings with the head of the Abwehr in San Sebastián. 66 With his <lb/>visits to the north of Spain, the German may have been trying to facilitate the commu-<lb/>nications between Berlin, the clandestine command posts on the Iberian Peninsula, and <lb/>the intelligence networks based in the Canary Islands and Río de Oro. However, agents <lb/>in these locations had an additional role on behalf of the Third Reich: the activation <lb/>of transatlantic networks for the smuggling of secret material (coded documents, cor-<lb/>respondence and propaganda material) between Germany, Spain and South America <lb/>(mainly Argentina) on Spanish vessels crossing the Atlantic, operations probably run <lb/>along with the naval Etappendienst. 67 <lb/>Niemann&apos;s organization also specialized in sabotage and subversive activities. His <lb/>agents sought not only to attack Allied ships and inland facilities, but also to foment <lb/>riot and rebellion in the Allied territories of North Africa. These subversive activities <lb/>involved infiltration of the French colonies and the systematic delivery of weapons and <lb/>ammunition to local residents. 68 According to Allied intelligence records, the Germans <lb/>attempted to sabotage the SS Hartington while it was anchored at the Port of La Luz for <lb/>repairs between June and July 1942. However, the plan was abandoned in light of the <lb/>Allies&apos; close watch over the ship while it was docked. 69 After the Italian surrender and <lb/>under Allied pressure, the Spanish Government agreed to hand over the Italian ships <lb/>anchored in Spanish ports to the Allies. The KO-Spanien tried to prevent this transfer <lb/>and planned various sabotage actions in Spain. In Las Palmas and Tenerife, the crew <lb/>of the Italian ships, acting either on their own initiative or under pressure from the <lb/>German consulate, tried to destroy the ship&apos;s machinery. In addition, José Segura, a <lb/>Spaniard who was part of Gruppe II of the Abwehr in Las Palmas, admitted to having <lb/>placed explosive charges onboard one of the ships. None of these attempted acts of <lb/>sabotage was successful. 70 <lb/>Niemann established a well-defined network of German agents and informants. <lb/>According to Allied records, active agents on the island of Tenerife included Consul <lb/>Jacob Ahlers (in addition to his role as a German naval intelligence agent, Ahlers was <lb/>listed as an agent of I-M KO-Spanien); police agent Heinrich Bandholtz; biologist and <lb/>teacher Friedrich Heinrich Wilhelm Behrens; Albert Fiess, the first head of the Nazi <lb/>Party on the island; Vice-Consul Ernst Groth; members of the Herzog family (Heinrich, <lb/>Oskar and Heinrich Paul); Dietrich Wilhelm Osterloh, an influential resident of Puerto <lb/></body>

According to records confiscated by the Allies, the German vice-consul <lb/>in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Ernst Albert Groth, may have served as an agent of Ast <lb/>Hamburg. 71 Amongst those in Las Palmas on whom Niemann could draw were the <lb/>merchant Robert Andersen; Otto Bertram, manager of Deutsche Lufthansa; Franz <lb/>Wilhelm Noelke, former vice-consul of Monrovia, in Liberia (described as an agent of <lb/>the IM KO-Spanien); Otto Dietzold, merchant and head of the German Labour Front <lb/>(Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF), also described as an agent of the IM KO-Spanien; businessmen <lb/>Karl Grimm and Hans Klinge; Consul Walter Sauermann; and Walter Vogel, who was <lb/>in charge of Woermann Linie. Vogel acted for the Abwehr and Etappendienst under the <lb/>code name &apos;Walter Oldius&apos;, and his postal address was used as a contact address for an <lb/>Ast Hamburg agent in August 1941. 72 <lb/>In Ifni, Fernando Poo (Bioko, a Spanish colony in in the Gulf of Guinea), Cabo Juby <lb/>and Villa Cisneros, Niemann&apos;s network involved figures such as Hans Haunesse (aka <lb/>Nicolás Etienne Simmer or Hans Heinrich) and Pablo Ressing (sometimes also referred <lb/>to as Pablo García), among many others. 73 Niemann made frequent trips to Cabo Juby <lb/>in Spanish military planes. He had a fairly permanent circle of trusted individuals in <lb/>both French Morocco and Ifni that included Bernal (a bus operator who did not cross <lb/>the border but always found reasons to stop close to it and make contact with indi-<lb/>viduals who came from the French zone), Luis Morón Martínez (a representative of <lb/>Iberian insurance companies who had permission to enter French Morocco and had <lb/>served as a messenger for the Germans), Aguirre and José Casas Canesa (both Spanish <lb/>citizens who also entered French territory as messengers), and Gottfried von Waldheim <lb/>(who had previously been the German consul in Monrovia and was living temporally <lb/>in the Canary Islands). 74 <lb/>For his daily activities in Las Palmas, Niemann used the offices and the official <lb/>telephone number of the Canary Islands and North West Africa Air Zone (Zona Aérea de <lb/>Canarias y del África Occidental; one of the territorial divisions of the Spanish Air Force), <lb/>which even appeared as associated with him in the telephone book at the local Nazi <lb/>Party headquarters. 75 Evidently, between 1940 and 1942 Niemann constantly collab-<lb/>orated with the heads of the Spanish General Staff in the Canary Islands (military, air <lb/></body>

      <body>and naval), receiving a regular supply of information about the Allies. In exchange, <lb/>Niemann included in his circle a large network of Spanish collaborators, especially mili-<lb/>tary men and air force officers, among whom were Colonel Juan Hernández Aceituno, <lb/>commander of the Spanish Sahara territories; Colonel Francisco Escribano Aguirre, <lb/>chief of the Air Forces of the Atlantic and Saharan Possessions; Admiral Juan Pastor <lb/>Tomaseti; and Más de Gaminde, regional commander of the Air Forces of the Canary <lb/>Islands and the North West African Zone. 76 <lb/>Niemann knew how to play his cards as an intelligence agent. He appears to <lb/>have used several cover names, such as Gustav Nehrkorn, Neubrecker, Neurrecher, <lb/>Noherenbacher, Dr Onkel, and Niemeyer, pseudonyms, often combined, that could <lb/>have served as aliases or were perhaps the result of Allied confusion. 77 Allied intelli-<lb/>gence agents in Morocco and the Canaries had great difficulty verifying his identity <lb/>during much of the war. Indeed, they even came to doubt his existence, associating his <lb/>last name Niemann with the German word niemand, or &apos;nobody&apos;. 78 <lb/>In addition to Niemann&apos;s intelligence network, the Abwehr also established in Las <lb/>Palmas a section of the Büro Plankert, which, at least in 1942/43, had ten members. 79 <lb/>This group specialized in monitoring the messages of the armies and Anglo-American <lb/>diplomatic entities in Africa. According to records compiled by the Allies after they <lb/>seized German buildings in the islands, the core of the network was formed by Germans <lb/>Heinrich Maur (Mauer), Kurt Karl Soeder and Arthur Gebauer. Gebauer had arrived <lb/>in Las Palmas at the beginning of the First World War, and according to the Allied <lb/>intelligence services, he may have been acting as a telegraph operator and operator <lb/>of naval wireless communications since then. Maur was born in 1893 and arrived in <lb/>Las Palmas in 1935. He was a telegraph operator for the Lufthansa organization in <lb/>Las Palmas and an employee of the Wehrmacht High Command Communications <lb/>Department Interception-Cryptography unit in Las Palmas. Between February 1941 <lb/>and November 1944, he also worked for the I-i KO-Spanien. 80 These men, listed as <lb/>Sonderkommando agents, were military personnel dedicated to wireless telegraphy work in <lb/>Spain who had a White Pass, a permit that gave regular access to diplomatic facilities. 81 <lb/></body>

    <body>According to US intelligence, Wilhelm Jenssen, a German resident of Tenerife, was <lb/>also listed in the Abwehr records as a member of Büro Plankert. 82 <lb/>Some of the most prominent supporters of Nazism on the islands, especially those <lb/>with influence within the local branches of the Nazi Party, also acted as political and <lb/>police intelligence agents. Their principal goals were policing, maintaining order within <lb/>the German community and deploying counterintelligence. Such movements were par-<lb/>ticularly active on the island of Tenerife, where a system for monitoring Allied intel-<lb/>ligence was deployed in the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. 83 US intelligence forces <lb/>highlighted the pressure and coercion carried out there by German residents such as <lb/>Karl Heinrich Bandholtz (also Bandholz) and Bernard Diepenbrock. Both were de-<lb/>scribed by the FBI as representatives of the SiPo (Sicherheitspolizei, Security Police) and <lb/>SD (Sicherheitsdienst, Security Service) in Santa Cruz de Tenerife since at least December <lb/>1940. 84 <lb/>Bandholtz, born on 3 December 1899, arrived in the archipelago around 1941. <lb/>According to Allied intelligence, he had acted under the cover of the German con-<lb/>sulate since the summer of 1941 and had a safe conduct issued by the Spanish General <lb/>Directorate of Security on 2 March 1943. 85 In its register of German subjects in <lb/>Tenerife, the General Captaincy of the Canary Islands described Bandholtz as a pro-<lb/>fessional in criminology and police matters with the title of a Gestapo / SiPo agent. 86 <lb/>In postwar American records, Bandholtz was also listed as an SS police officer. After <lb/>the war he was interned by the British, and during the Cold War he worked with <lb/>US intelligence services: for example, from July 1965 his residence in Tannenbusch <lb/>in Bonn, West Germany, was used by the CIA as a listening post in operations Cavoice <lb/>and Aetophat. 87 Diepenbrock, born on 29 May 1900, was a prominent merchant in <lb/>Tenerife. He had a close relationship with pro-German Spanish and Falange circles <lb/>on the island, and according to the Allies he was directly associated with Bandholtz. 88 <lb/>IV. Allied Counterintelligence and German Disintegration <lb/>From 1943, Allied intelligence and diplomacy agencies in the Canary Islands concen-<lb/>trated their efforts on registering the German community residing on the islands and <lb/>the deployment of counterintelligence.

      <body>was eager to capture Niemann and his collaborators after an alleged illegal crossing on <lb/>the Spanish-French border in Morocco. This plan was integrated into Operation Snatch, <lb/>designed by the African section of the Office of Strategic Services and other American <lb/>and French military intelligence divisions between March and May 1944. 89 In spring <lb/>and summer 1944, Allied military units and intelligence services in Morocco arrested <lb/>members of several Spanish intelligence groups on the African border, but no evi-<lb/>dence suggests that Operation Snatch was carried out against Niemann&apos;s network. From <lb/>the summer of 1944, the Allies limited their efforts to presenting formal complaints to <lb/>the Spanish government to have the most prominent German agents expelled from <lb/>Spanish territory. 90 <lb/>With the conclusion of the conflict, the Allies began a slow process of dismantling <lb/>Nazism in the Canary Islands, involving the economic control of the German popula-<lb/>tion, the seizure of official assets and facilities, and the repatriation of German citizens. <lb/>One of the first targets for repatriation was Edmund Niemann&apos;s intelligence network. <lb/>The Americans complained about the situation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <lb/>the Spanish Government between February and May 1945. The Allied complaints set <lb/>in motion extended correspondence and official investigations involving the Spanish <lb/>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the minister Félix de Lequerica, the General <lb/>Directorate of Security of the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of the Army, <lb/>among other bodies. Although General Francisco García Escámez, chief of the mili-<lb/>tary, naval and air forces of the Canary Islands, shared records on the German suspects <lb/>compiled by Spanish military intelligence in the Canary Islands, the information they <lb/>contained was limited and had been extensively redacted. 91 The largest number of <lb/>German residents of the Canary Islands were repatriated on the SS Marine Marlin, <lb/>which left Bilbao on 31 August 1946. 92 Departures of individuals, including Edmund <lb/>Niemann, were carried out simultaneously, by plane and under police surveillance. 93 <lb/>The repatriation or departure of German residents did not prevent a subsequent re-<lb/>turn to the archipelago: Edmund Niemann was on a list of Germans who had already <lb/>returned to Spain by September 1948. <lb/>V. Conclusions <lb/>The Second World War had significant impact on daily life in the Canary Islands, not <lb/>only as a result of involvement in the war operations of Britain and Germany, but <lb/>also as a result of foreign diplomacy, propaganda and intelligence carried out there. <lb/>German intelligence agencies implemented significant operations in the Canary Islands, <lb/>promoted in particular by the German Embassy in Madrid, consulates established in <lb/>Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and intelligence organizations including the <lb/></body><listBibl>89 NARA, RG 226/97/34, From David King to Edward W.

      <body>Abwehr and the information divisions of the Etappendienst. The military and strategic in-<lb/>telligence services of the Third Reich hid their clandestine actions under the cover of <lb/>diplomatic and business activities. German agents used a range of covert and subver-<lb/>sive channels, fostering the potential of strategic espionage. <lb/>Foreign powers connected their intelligence campaigns in the Canaries with their <lb/>efforts in north-west Africa. The Third Reich, for example, deployed an intelligence <lb/>network controlled by Edmund Niemann that stretched from the Canary Islands to Ifni <lb/>and Río de Oro, with members involved in subversive action in French North Africa. <lb/>The intelligence agencies of the Third Reich acted clandestinely to support the prep-<lb/>aration and execution of supply operations, smuggling, sabotage and subversion. Like <lb/>Britain, Germany had longstanding presence on the islands, an influence that had been <lb/>consolidated since the end of the nineteenth century and was especially active in the <lb/>1930s. In addition, German intelligence had the approval of the Franco government <lb/>and benefited from the cooperation of many Spanish citizens, not just from the most <lb/>important military, political and socio-cultural sectors, but also from less prominent en-<lb/>vironments, such as the technical, fishing, port and commercial sectors. <lb/>Although comparatively these intelligence operations were on a small scale, they <lb/>are a noteworthy element of Atlantic history and nissology, the study of islands on <lb/>their own terms. This case study highlights ways in which the Canary Islands were <lb/>significant, such as their strategic importance, their distinct wartime character, and the <lb/>actions of foreign communities. It also contributes to the study of intelligence in the his-<lb/>tory of Germany, Spain and the Allies. This research demonstrates how transnational <lb/>intelligence missions were possible in the Second World War, moving away from the <lb/>greater discreteness typical of earlier conflicts with the assistance of technological ad-<lb/>vances and in light of the global reach of the war. The ties between the Canary Islands <lb/>and clandestine activities in the African colonies of Spain and France also contribute <lb/>to the history of north-west Africa during the war, a strategic scenario that repeatedly <lb/>conditioned the outcome of the conflict. <lb/>The German mission in the Canary Islands demonstrates the relevance of neutral <lb/>territories in international conflicts, in particular the strategic significance of Spain, its <lb/>colonies and archipelagos. The activities described are examples of the relationships <lb/>between war, diplomacy, intelligence and neutrality and demonstrate the great value <lb/>of information for the planning and execution of military operations. The similarities <lb/>and contrasts between military and naval intelligence, political espionage, sabotage and <lb/>counterintelligence are revealing. This case also highlights how diplomatic, commer-<lb/>cial, socio-political and military agents, who often adopted aliases, could complement <lb/>ordinary informants and collaborators. Particularly fascinating is the recycling of intel-<lb/>ligence agents and services across four contexts: the First World War, the Spanish Civil <lb/>War, the Second World War, and the Cold War. <lb/>German intelligence, espionage, sabotage and subversion operations during the <lb/>Second World War were dynamic, evolving in the course of the conflict. The German <lb/>community residing abroad could play a strategic role, bolstered, it appears, by the <lb/>embrace of National Socialism beyond the borders of the Third Reich. This research <lb/>has provided new examples of how German influence in Spain played out and of <lb/>regular Spanish-German collaboration during this global war. It supports studies of <lb/>the composition, organization and functioning of German intelligence services in <lb/></body>

      <body>Spain, including the Abwehr (KO-Spanien), the Sicherheitsdienst, the Sicherheitspolizei and the <lb/>Etappendienst. It also makes evident the international work carried out by local networks <lb/>of the Abwehr, the use of cover addresses in neutral regions, and the activation of trans-<lb/>oceanic smuggling networks for the exchange of secret material and coded documenta-<lb/>tion. German activities in the Canary Islands also provide examples of the conduits of <lb/>Abwehr missions, with contacts between (1) the north and south of Spain, (2) the Canary <lb/>Islands and north-west Africa, and (3) the Spanish archipelago and Latin America. <lb/>Both Germany and the Allies practised counterintelligence in the Canary Islands <lb/>that built on earlier campaigns. The end of the war meant, however, the dismantling of <lb/>the clandestine structures deployed by the Third Reich. While members of the German <lb/>intelligence and espionage networks on the islands were repatriated to Germany, some <lb/>never left and others returned, continuing or picking up again their prominent eco-<lb/>nomic and socio-cultural role in the life of the islands. <lb/></body>
      
      <front>Abstract <lb/>Between 1939 and 1945, the Canary Islands, an important region of nominally neutral or non-belligerent <lb/>Spain, were a site of military planning, diplomacy, propaganda, naval supply, and intelligence. Most prac-<lb/>tically, the Third Reich utilized the islands as a supply station for ships and submarines. It could also <lb/>draw on the National Socialist sympathies of the large and integrated German community. It established <lb/>intelligence-gathering campaigns in four forms: (1) naval intelligence gathered by the secret supply service <lb/>of the German Navy, (2) a network of espionage, information, subversion and sabotage operations organ-<lb/>ized by the Abwehr, which connected the islands with Río de Oro, Ifni and Cabo Juby in Spanish Sahara, <lb/>(3) a military radio monitoring and interception substation; and (4) surveillance and information-gathering <lb/>undertaken by agents of police organizations. This article considers the role played by German intelligence <lb/>in the Canary Islands as a case study of wartime intelligence operations. <lb/>University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain <lb/>marta.garcia@ulpgc.es <lb/></front>
