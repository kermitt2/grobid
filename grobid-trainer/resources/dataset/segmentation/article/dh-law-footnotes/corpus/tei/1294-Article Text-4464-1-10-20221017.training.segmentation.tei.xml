        <body>Introduction <lb/>Citizens whose rights are infringed by a public authority are often unable to attain a court <lb/>judgment to challenge those adverse decisions. The trite explanation is the most <lb/>compelling; judicial review is a prohibitively expensive process. 2 This high cost of <lb/>litigation combined with the fees charged by public lawyers can make fighting for one&apos;s <lb/>legal rights inaccessible to those without independent means or publicly funded legal <lb/>representation. There is no question that this is a complete explanation for many instances <lb/>of unmet legal need, but this paper seeks to raise another important barrier to access to <lb/>justice that is seldom discussed in the recent literature. <lb/>Legal capability is defined as the knowledge, skills and confidence required to participate <lb/>in legal systems and to deal with one&apos;s legal issues. It is thought to be improved through <lb/></body>

These <lb/>experiences will be used to examine the (minimal) effectiveness of initiatives such as the <lb/>placement of human rights into the National Curriculum for Citizenship Education in <lb/>2013 and the requirement that all English schools promote the &apos;fundamental British value&apos; <lb/>of the Rule of Law. <lb/>This article further argues that the state can provide meaningful information about public <lb/>authorities&apos; duties and citizens&apos; entitlements through public legal information, and that <lb/>there is a moral impetus for it to do so.

        <body>that those subject to unlawful administrative decision making have the legal capability <lb/>to mitigate further damage to their interests and pursue the correct decision. <lb/>Access to justice and the rule of law are broader than legal aid <lb/>Access to justice has underpinned English notions of fairness in the legal system since <lb/>Magna Carta stated that &quot;to no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.&quot; 5 <lb/>This was echoed some 800 years later by British judge Lord Bingham of Cornhill, who <lb/>laid out a definition of the rule of law that is striking in its clarity. He described two <lb/>hallmarks of the rule of law which are of major relevance to this paper; the first that &quot;the <lb/>law must be accessible and so far as possible, intelligible, clear and practicable.&quot; 6 The <lb/>second principle is that &quot;means must be provided for resolving, without prohibitive cost <lb/>or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties are themselves unable to <lb/>resolve.&quot; 7 <lb/>The practical significance of these principles is that the law should be comprehensible in <lb/>order to justify its binding role on the actions of citizens, and that the state should provide <lb/>opportunities to resolve incorrect decisions made about those citizens; there should be <lb/>access to justice. This line of thinking was key to the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <lb/></body>

How did it come to be so pivotal? As a welfarist <lb/>political consensus emerged after the Second World War, the Atlee government enacted <lb/>the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949. This Act created the Legal Aid Board which would <lb/>provide those of &quot;small or moderate means&quot; with the necessary funding to secure legal <lb/>representation for their civil legal problems. 9 <lb/>Legal aid has been largely viewed as a welcome achievement, but its operation has not <lb/>been without criticism. Eligibility for legal aid has always been targeted at the most hard-<lb/>pressed, and as such decisions to grant funding are subject to a means test. 10 This means <lb/>test has the potential to leave lower-middle class individuals subject to a legal problem <lb/>undercompensated if they take a party to court, as they are unlikely to recover all of the <lb/>costs of representation even if successful. 11 <lb/>This was exacerbated by a change of policy by the UK government as the country entered <lb/>the second decade of the 21st century.

This was wrought by the Legal Aid, Sentencing <lb/>and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) which paved the way for the legal aid <lb/>budget to be cut by over 1billion over the next ten years, 12 creating a situation described <lb/>by the Law Society as &apos;a wide[r] and detrimental effect on society&apos;&apos;. 13 <lb/>Drilling down to the regional level, there are whole areas of the United Kingdom in which <lb/>there are no qualified legal aid solicitors specialising in given areas of law.

        <body>oft-discussed public policy issue. 16 It is clear that there is unmet legal need for judicial <lb/>review in most parts of the country; if you live outside the capital, your ability to <lb/>challenge public decision making is severely limited. <lb/>It is worth reminding ourselves of the importance of legally aided litigation. Cases of <lb/>central importance to our democracy have arisen from legally aided claimants who <lb/>would otherwise have been unable to bring these cases, of which Donoghue v Stephenson <lb/>is the most infamous. Had Ms Donoghue not been able to bring her case, she would not <lb/>have been compensated for the harm that she suffered, but more crucially the principle <lb/>that we owe each other a duty of care to prevent reasonably foreseeable harms would not <lb/>have resulted. It is uncontroversial to say that legal aid, and the legal assistance that it <lb/>facilitates, is much needed in realising rights. <lb/>Legal aid is irreplaceable and serves an important role, but its apotheosis as the main <lb/>element of the post-Atlee welfare state is highly problematic. As the replacement of the <lb/>Legal Aid Board with the Legal Services Commission and later the Legal Aid Agency <lb/>would show, the body was prone to severe disruption by changing political priorities. <lb/>Legal aid was born in an era of post-war political consensus in which Conservative <lb/>politicians were more comfortable with supporting social welfare programmes. 17 This <lb/></body>

Some of the greatest gains in legal rights are achieved by using <lb/>the law outside of the courtroom. Civic participation in Scotland, the so-called &apos;Snowdrop <lb/>campaign&apos; saw the UK Government pass the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 to prohibit <lb/>the possession of small firearms. The National Farmers&apos; Union organised blockades in <lb/>order to argue for a reduction in fuel tax. Though unsuccessful in this aim, they succeeded <lb/>in securing a freeze of fuel prices. 20 These were sophisticated operations in which <lb/>professional activists used their knowledge of the different &apos;levers&apos; that could be pulled <lb/>in order to achieve societal change.

As the Public Legal Education <lb/>and Advice Service task force stated, PLE is the tool needed to achieve legal capability. 22 <lb/>One might then ask the question, what levers does the UK government pull in order to <lb/>ensure provision of PLE? <lb/>The political geography of the UK makes this question more complex. Education is a <lb/>devolved competence in the UK, meaning that the devolved administrations of Northern <lb/>Ireland, Scotland and Wales maintain their own national approaches. There is an <lb/>awkwardness in the fact that we wish to teach students about the English and Welsh legal <lb/>system, yet England and Wales pursue different approaches to education. The author is <lb/>a product of the English education system and this chapter focuses explicitly on the <lb/>English context. <lb/></body>

        <body>There is currently no effective legal obligation requiring the UK government to ensure <lb/>that every English citizen has legal capability; nor is there an obligation to implement <lb/>PLE across England. PLE has not been the subject of litigation in the United Kingdom, <lb/>and so the common law does not provide any assistance in this area. Similarly, there are <lb/>several international treaties that reference PLE&apos;s cognate concepts (especially citizenship <lb/>education) but these are not directly effective in the UK; the UK is a &apos;dualist&apos; system in <lb/>which international law and treaties need further national legislation in order to confer <lb/>real rights. <lb/>The major treaties calling on the UK government to implement aspects of PLE are: <lb/>• UN Declaration Human Rights Education and Training (&apos;UDHRET&apos;) 23 <lb/>• UN Convention on the Rights of the Child <lb/>• Council of Europe Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human <lb/>Rights Education (&apos;the Charter&apos;) 24 <lb/>Despite a clear thread throughout these instruments that young people should be taught <lb/>about their rights, these treaties are seldom referred to in the work of Parliament. 25 The <lb/>inability of these instruments to encourage action from politicians was illustrated in an <lb/></body>

The most compelling <lb/>provision is s1(g) of the Legal Services Act 2007 (LSA 2007) which imposes an obligation <lb/>upon the Legal Services Board (LSB) to &quot;increasing public understanding of the citizen&apos;s <lb/>legal rights and duties.&quot; <lb/>Though the placement of this obligation in statute is novel, and of relevance to the current <lb/>discussion it is deficient in several respects. Put simply, imposing the obligation on the <lb/>LSB doesn&apos;t guarantee any PLE activity. Legal professionals are not best placed to <lb/>provide such an onerous duty alongside their core role, representing clients. The LSB <lb/>itself is not a &apos;front-line regulator&apos; but instead a &apos;regulator of regulators&apos; in essence acting <lb/>through regulators such as the Bar Standards Board and Solicitors Regulatory Authority <lb/>to influence lawyers. This means that the LSB has made a modest number of PLE <lb/>interventions (such as running the collaborative &apos;Justice Week&apos; campaign) and the impact <lb/>of the LSA 2007 has been limited in respect of legal capability. <lb/></body>

        <body>LSB Justice Week Events <lb/>The most authoritative and influential obligation to deliver PLE is the framework <lb/>surrounding the Education Act 2002. S78 of the Act states that maintained schools should <lb/>provide a &apos;balanced and broadly based curriculum&apos; which &apos;promotes the spiritual, moral, <lb/>cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society&apos;. This <lb/>obligation would go on to be known as &apos;SMSC&apos; by the teaching profession. The <lb/>Department for Education modified this requirement in September 2014 to require SMSC <lb/>to include promotion of the &apos;Fundamental British Values&apos;. These &apos;FBVs&apos; comprise: <lb/>1. democracy, <lb/>2. the rule of law, <lb/>3. individual liberty and <lb/>4. mutual respect and tolerance for those of different and no faiths. <lb/>This new requirement was complemented by the Department for Education guidance, <lb/>&apos;Promoting fundamental British values through SMSC&apos;. This document sets out a highly <lb/></body>

        <body>rigid and conformist notion of law with the rather regrettable expression that &quot;The <lb/>school&apos;s ethos and teaching, which schools should make parents aware of, should <lb/>support the rule of English civil and criminal law and schools should not teach anything <lb/>that undermines it.&quot; 27 <lb/>These highly individualised forms of legal education focus specifically around the <lb/>individual&apos;s responsibility to shape their family life and home affairs in such a way as to <lb/>avoid criminal liability. This is important, but incomplete; these incentives do not <lb/>encourage students to consider how they might campaign collectively to achieve societal <lb/>justice or how they might pursue law reform or how they might act with others to create <lb/>political change. They encourage the idea that the status quo is optimal without <lb/>consideration of alternatives. 28 <lb/>The Attorney General&apos;s Office would make another significant intervention in this area <lb/>in 2017 in the formation of the Solicitor General&apos;s &apos;PLE Panel&apos;, 29 which would later be <lb/>renamed the &apos;Solicitor General&apos;s PLE Committee&apos;.

PLE will be supported by a robust evidence base, showing what the need is and <lb/>what works best, <lb/>2. PLE will be of high quality, maintained to ensure that it remains accurate and <lb/>accessible and useful for the people who need it, <lb/>3. PLE will be universal and reach across all demographics, prioritising children, <lb/>young adults and vulnerable groups, <lb/>4. PLE will be scaled up through delivery by the legal community, <lb/>5. PLE will harness technology and be delivered through innovative methods, both <lb/>on and offline, <lb/>6. PLE will be embedded into public services and government departments <lb/>7.

        <body>Although this launch was enthusiastically attended by the justice sector, and overtures <lb/>were made to PLE in the Attorney General&apos;s Business Plan for 2020-2021, the action plan <lb/>has so far resulted in minimal activity at the time of writing this piece some three years <lb/>later. 33 This could be in part due to the de facto role the Solicitor General has assumed in <lb/>representing PLE within government. The Solicitor General post suffered from the <lb/>politically unstable zeitgeist as six appointments were made to the role between July 2019 <lb/>and September 2022. This period also saw the longest-running minister in this period, <lb/>Michael Ellis QC MP, given additional responsibility for the government&apos;s response to <lb/>the COVID-19 pandemic. <lb/>As a leading member of the group it is my view that the Solicitor General&apos;s PLE <lb/>Committee has not been able to achieve the radical promise set out in its vision. <lb/>The curriculum operationalised PLE through citizenship education <lb/>Another major attempt to place PLE at the heart of the English learning experience has <lb/>been through the curriculum.

Though we should not think that these years saw perfect <lb/>provision of PLE throughout the country, this was certainly its heyday, because over the <lb/>subsequent twenty five years there would be significant decline in this subject. <lb/>The early days of the 2010 coalition government saw the Department for Education <lb/>introduce the Academies Act 2010, which facilitated the transformation in legal status of <lb/>schools formerly attached to their local authority that would now become &apos;academies&apos; <lb/>without an obligation to follow the curriculum. It was at this point that teaching <lb/>Citizenship became a voluntary, rather than compulsory subject for many academised <lb/>schools. 36 <lb/>Citizenship allowed to degrade to a parlous state <lb/>Several members of the House of Lords who had been involved in the creation of <lb/>Citizenship Education were concerned about its lack of universality across England. <lb/>Reacting to this concern, Lord Blunkett (who had been the Secretary of State for <lb/>Education presiding over its introduction) and others set up an &apos;ad hoc&apos; select committee <lb/></body>

        <body>UK government entered into extensive negotiations with the EU about the future <lb/>relationship between the nation and the bloc. <lb/>The EU placed a longstop on those negotiations; existing obligations would expire on 31st <lb/>December 2020 and the UK would &apos;crash out&apos; of the provisional arrangements if no deal <lb/>had been reached by that point. UK Prime Minister Johnson tried unsuccessfully to <lb/>persuade Parliament to pass the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, a legislative instrument <lb/>that would give effect to his negotiated settlement. <lb/>In a widely criticised move, Johnson sought to end the session of Parliament, reducing <lb/>the number of opportunities MPs would have to scrutinise the legislation.

        <body>greater social pressure from the public, and a more widespread section of it, upon their <lb/>elected representative to resist this? Must a citizen be well-advised and wealthy to bring <lb/>a major constitutional challenge? <lb/>This point struck most resonantly in the wake of the &apos;Miller 2&apos; case. A YouGov instant <lb/>response poll asked, &quot;the Supreme Court has said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson <lb/>acted unlawfully in proroguing Parliament. Do you agree or disagree with the ruling?&quot; 43 <lb/>Up to 30 percent of the public disagreed with the court&apos;s orthodox decision, and another <lb/>21 percent stated that they did not know how they felt. These figures partially illustrate <lb/>the widespread deficiency in legal capability as well as the complex tribalism effected by <lb/>the referendum and the post-2019 Johnson administration. <lb/>Irrespective of the merits of the decision, enforcement of the constitutional order by <lb/>citizens is a contemporary challenge described by the Bingham Centre as an urgent need <lb/>to &apos;democratise&apos; the rule of law. This is an area in which PLE is better placed than judicial <lb/>review representation orders in improving the quality of democratic participation. The <lb/>executive can only be held accountable for breaches of its obligations if individuals are <lb/>able and prepared to challenge public decision making. <lb/></body>

        <body>Conclusion <lb/>English PLE is at an early point in its implementation. There have been a number of <lb/>highly promising governmental initiatives that have not received sufficient political will <lb/>or resources in order to make legal capability stick. The information distributed to <lb/>influence citizens during the referendum and public health campaigns (e.g. smoking and <lb/>coronavirus) show that the government is capable of disseminating compelling messages; <lb/>choices about resources prevent it from exercising that ability. <lb/>This knowing choice to baulk at recent opportunities to accompany major moments of <lb/>constitutional reform with PLE is distressing. It is problematic because of the scale of <lb/>proposed reform, which will likely take place without most citizens being aware of its <lb/>stark consequences. <lb/>Although superficial, the author has observed clear cross-party popularity for PLE <lb/>initiatives. Advocates of access to justice can and should continue to pursue increasing <lb/>the legal aid budget in order to assist people with resolving disputes they cannot resolve <lb/>themselves. However PLE should always be on the table whenever we make any <lb/>argument about legal aid funding due to its invigorating effect on the democracy as well <lb/>as the role it serves in bridging warring political ideologies. <lb/>Our advocacy of PLE should be passionate but not uncritical. There is a possibility that <lb/>PLE becomes a neo-liberal political vehicle for the laissez-faire state providing nothing. <lb/>54 <lb/>This is an undercurrent I am aware of from my several years advising ministers in this <lb/>area and such an ideology ought to be resisted; we call for increased support and <lb/>expansion of PLE to complement a fully functioning, properly funded legal system. </body>
