			<body>Background &amp; Summary <lb/>The AmeriFlux network 1 , which is part of the global FLUXNET 2 network of eddy covariance towers, is <lb/>an important tool for measuring land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, energy, and water at local to global <lb/>scales 3,4 . The network uses eddy covariance instruments and standardized data processing techniques to pro-<lb/>vide non-destructive measurements of ecosystem fluxes at high temporal resolution, which makes it a unique <lb/>and powerful tool for studying how ecosystems are influencing and responding to climate change 1-4 . However, <lb/>analysing and interpreting how measured fluxes are affected by local environmental conditions, and particularly <lb/>spatio-temporal variation in local vegetation properties, is challenging. Many eddy covariance towers now have <lb/>PhenoCams 5,6 , which provide valuable information and imagery that can be used to characterize and monitor <lb/>canopy conditions in the vicinity of towers. However, PhenoCams have fixed and limited fields of view that only <lb/>capture local conditions in the camera field of view or region of interest. Given the important role of vegetation <lb/>phenology in controlling fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, spatially explicit information related to vegeta-<lb/>tion phenology has significant utility for studies that use eddy covariance tower data to quantify and interpret <lb/>land-atmosphere interactions and their role in ecosystem function and weather and climate processes 7-10 . <lb/>Remote sensing has been used for several decades to monitor and map the land surface phenology (LSP) <lb/>of terrestrial ecosystems 11-14 and has also been used to estimate models of land-atmosphere fluxes calibrated <lb/>to eddy covariance measurements 15-18 . Until recently, however, the temporal frequency of image acquisitions <lb/>required for this latter application has constrained these studies to using coarse spatial resolution imagery (e.g., <lb/>MODIS at 500 m), which limits their utility for understanding how local variability in landscape properties <lb/>influence fluxes. Bolton et al. 19 recently demonstrated that harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data can provide <lb/>high-quality LSP information at 30 m spatial resolution, but even this resolution fails to capture fine-scale varia-<lb/>tion (i.e., below 30 m) in phenology and vegetation cover (related to, for example, species composition or patchy <lb/>vegetation structure) that can influence land-atmosphere fluxes 20-22 . <lb/>Several recent studies have demonstrated that commercially available PlanetScope imagery can be used to <lb/>monitor and map LSP at fine spatial resolution, thereby providing new opportunities to exploit high spatial <lb/></body>

			<body>resolution LSP measurements for studies that require spatially explicit information related to vegetation phe-<lb/>nology 23-26 . PlanetScope imagery is acquired by a constellation of CubeSats (180 + as of 2022), and provides <lb/>daily imagery in four bands spanning the visible and near-infrared wavelengths at a nominal spatial resolution <lb/>of 3 m 27 . Although PlanetScope data do not have the radiometric fidelity and geometric accuracy 28,29 of publicly <lb/>available medium spatial resolution imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, the higher spatial and temporal <lb/>resolution of PlanetScope imagery creates new opportunities to investigate a wide array of land surface proper-<lb/>ties and processes. For example, Moon et al. 26 used PlanetScope imagery in association with the LSP algorithm <lb/>developed by Bolton et al. 19 and reported that LSP metrics estimated using PlanetScope imagery show strong <lb/>agreement with LSP metrics derived from high-quality publicly available 30 m satellite imagery (i.e., Landsat <lb/>8 and Sentinel 2) and from PhenoCams. Their results demonstrated that PlanetScope imagery captures useful <lb/>information related to vegetation phenology at 3 m spatial resolution across a range of ecosystem types 26 , and <lb/>that fine-scale variation in landscape properties arising from land use, water bodies, species composition, and <lb/>vegetation structure results in substantial spatial variation in phenology that is not captured at medium spatial <lb/>resolution (i.e., 30 m). <lb/>Building on the proof-of-concept provided by Moon et al. 26 , here we present a new LSP dataset derived from <lb/>3 m spatial resolution PlanetScope imagery covering 104 AmeriFlux and NEON sites that encompass a wide <lb/>range of plant functional types, biomes, and climates regimes in North America (Fig. 1). The dataset includes <lb/>standard LSP metrics that are commonly derived from remote sensing such as the day of year corresponding <lb/>to the start, peak, and end of vegetation greenness, along with metrics that provide the maximum, amplitude, <lb/>and growing season sum of the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index 30 (EVI2) and associated quality assurance <lb/>flags. Data for the period 2017 to 2021 for areas that encompass the flux footprint and surrounding landscapes <lb/>at each tower site (10 × 10 km = 10 8 m 2 ) are included in the dataset. To document and illustrate the quality of <lb/>these data, we present results from a comprehensive assessment using two independent data sources: (1) LSP <lb/>metrics from the Multisensor Land Surface Phenology dataset, which is derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 <lb/>and Sentinel-2 imagery 31 ; and (2) phenometrics from the PhenoCam V3 Dataset. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Site selection. We selected 104 sites covering a range of ecological, land cover, and climate conditions <lb/>across North America (Table 1). These sites were selected because they are part of either the National Ecological <lb/>Observatory Network (NEON) or AmeriFlux network, all have PhenoCams, and each has at least one year of <lb/>available flux data between 2017 and 2021. Among the included sites, 44 are part of the NEON. <lb/>PlanetScope image database compilation. The LSP metrics included in the dataset are derived from a <lb/>database of daily 3 m PlanetScope imagery. To compile this database, a Python script was created to search, request, <lb/>and download imagery using Planet&apos;s RESTful API interface (https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/data/). <lb/>For each site, the area of interest (AOI) was defined using a GeoJSON file that prescribed a 10 by 10 km box <lb/>centered over the flux tower at each site. Each GeoJSON was then used to submit search requests to the API. As <lb/>part of the search process, the following filters were applied to ensure that good quality images with adequate <lb/>clear sky views and high-accuracy geolocation were downloaded: (1) quality category identified as &apos;standard&apos;; (2) <lb/>cloud cover less than or equal to 50%; and (3) ground control is &apos;true&apos; . Filtering was performed using all available <lb/>Fig. 1 Geographic distribution of sites included in the PLSP dataset across North America. Each site includes <lb/>data from a 10 × 10 km square centred over one AmeriFlux or NEON site (n = 104). Note that several adjacent <lb/>sites are not distinguishable on the map. The background map shows the IGBP land cover type from the MODIS <lb/>Land Cover Type product 35 . <lb/></body>

			<body>and failed orders. If an order failed, the script was run again targeting the specific order that failed. The resulting <lb/>dataset included over 1.8 million unique files with, on average, 3,885 scene images for each site (i.e., the number <lb/>of images, on average, that overlap part of each 10 by 10 km site), and had a total volume of 62.2 TB. <lb/>image processing. To ensure that high-quality image time series were used to generate LSP metrics, we <lb/>used PlanetScope per-pixel quality assurance information to exclude pixels that had low quality in all 4 bands <lb/>(i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared). Specifically, we excluded pixels where the Unusable Data Mask (layer <lb/>&apos;umd&apos;) was not 0 (i.e., we retained pixels that were not cloud contaminated or located in non-image areas) and <lb/>pixels where the Usable Data Mask (layer &apos;umd2&apos;) is 0 (i.e., we retained pixels that were not contaminated by <lb/>snow, shadow, haze, or clouds). We then cropped all the images to exclude pixels outside of the 10 by 10 km win-<lb/>dow centered over each tower. We selected this window size based on published results showing that 80% of the <lb/>average monthly footprint at eddy covariance towers ranges from 10 3 to 10 7 square meters 22 . Note that the swath <lb/>for PlanetScope imagery often did not cover entire sites and some sites (e.g., the tall tower at US-Pfa) have larger <lb/>footprints than other sites. Similarly, most sites had multiple PlanetScope image acquisitions on the same day. <lb/>To create image time series, we mosaiced all available imagery at each site on each date, and, under the assump-<lb/>tion that geolocation error was non-systematic and modest, we created a single image for each date using the <lb/>mean surface reflectance for pixels with multiple values on the same day.

			<body>reflectance images were sorted in chronological order, sub-divided into 200 sub-areas at each site (i.e., 0.5 km 2 <lb/>each), and then stored as image stacks to facilitate parallel processing to estimate LSP metrics, where each image <lb/>stack included all images from July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2022. <lb/>Creation of daily EVI2 time series. To estimate LSP metrics we adapted the algorithm described by Bolton <lb/>et al. 19 , which was originally implemented to estimate LSP metrics from harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 <lb/>(HLS) imagery, for use with PlanetScope imagery. Prior to LSP estimation, daily images of the two-band <lb/>Enhanced Vegetation Index 30 (EVI2) data were generated from PlanetScope imagery and then interpolated to <lb/>create smooth time series of daily EVI2 values at each pixel in three main steps. First, sources of variation related <lb/>to clouds, atmospheric aerosols, and snow were detected and removed from the EVI2 time series at each pixel <lb/>based on data masks provided with PlanetScope imagery (described above) and outlier detection criteria (i.e., <lb/>de-spiking and removing negative EVI2 values). Second, we identified the &apos;background&apos; EVI2 value (the mini-<lb/>mum EVI2 value outside of the growing season) based on the 10 th percentile of snow-free EVI2 values at each <lb/>pixel. Any dates with EVI2 values below the background value were replaced with the background EVI2. Third, <lb/>penalized cubic smoothing splines were used to gap-fill and smooth the data to create daily EVI2 time series <lb/>across all years of available data. Complete details on these steps are given in Bolton et al. 19 . This approach has <lb/>been tested and shown to yield PlanetScope EVI2 time series that are consistent with both EVI2 time series from <lb/>HLS imagery and time series of the Green Chromatic Coordinate (G CC ) from PhenoCam imagery 26 . We used <lb/>the EVI2 instead of other vegetation indices such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) or the Normalized <lb/>Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) because EVI2 is less sensitive to noise from atmospheric effects relative to <lb/>EVI and is less prone to saturation over dense canopies and noise from variation in soil background reflectance <lb/>over sparse canopies relative to the NDVI 30,32 . Thus, phenological metrics from EVI2 time series tend to have <lb/>better agreement with PhenoCam observations than corresponding metrics from NDVI 33 . <lb/>identifying phenological cycles. Prior to estimating LSP metrics, we first identity unique growth cycles by <lb/>searching the period before and after each local peak in the daily PlanetScope EVI2 time series. To be considered <lb/>a valid growth cycle, the difference in EVI2 between the local minimum and maximum was required to be at <lb/>least 0.1 and greater than 35% of the total range in EVI2 over the 24-month period centered on the target year ± 6 <lb/>Fig. 2 Greenup dates and EVI2 seasonal amplitudes in 2019.

			<body>months. The start of each growth cycle is restricted to occur within 185 days before the peak of the cycle and at <lb/>least 30 days after the previous peak. The same procedure was applied in reverse at the end of the cycle to con-<lb/>strain the range of end dates for each growth cycle. This procedure is applied recursively over the time series until <lb/>each local peak has been assessed and all growth cycles (with associated green-up period, peak greenness, and <lb/>green-down period) are identified in the time series at each pixel. As part of this process, the algorithm provides <lb/>the number of growth cycles identified for each year in the time series. <lb/>Retrieving LSP metrics. LSP metrics are estimated for each pixel in up to two growth cycles in each year. <lb/>If no growth cycles are detected, the algorithm returns fill values for all timing metrics, but does report values for <lb/>the four annual metrics: EVImax, EVIamp, EVIarea, and numObs (see below). If more than two growth cycles are <lb/>detected, which is rare but does occur (e.g., alfalfa, which is harvested and regrows multiple times in a year), the <lb/>algorithm records 7 LSP metrics for each of the two growth cycles with the largest EVI2 amplitudes. The resulting <lb/>dataset includes seven &apos;timing&apos; metrics that identify the timing of greenup onset, mid-greenup, maturity, peak <lb/>EVI2, greendown onset, mid-greendown, and dormancy. These metrics record the day of year (DOY) when the <lb/>EVI2 time series exceeds 15%, 50%, and 90% of EVI2 amplitude during the greenup phase, reaches its maximum, <lb/>and goes below 90%, 50%, and 15% of EVI2 amplitude during the greendown phase. In addition, the algorithm <lb/>records three complementary metrics that characterize the magnitude of seasonality and total &apos;greenness&apos; at each <lb/>pixel in each growth cycle: the EVI2 amplitude, the maximum EVI2, and the growing season integral of EVI2, <lb/>which is calculated as the sum of daily EVI2 values between the growth cycle start-and end-dates (i.e., from <lb/>greenup onset to dormancy). <lb/>Fig. 3 Five years of daily variation in vegetation activity at the Jornada LTER site (US-xJR).

			<body>Quality assurance flags. Quality Assurance (QA) values are estimated at each pixel based on the density of <lb/>observations and the quality of spline fits during each phenophase of the growing season. A QA value of 1 (high <lb/>quality) is assigned if the correlation between observed versus fitted daily EVI2 values is greater than 0.75 and <lb/>the maximum gap during each phase is less than 30 days. A QA value of 2 (moderate quality) is assigned if the <lb/>correlation coefficient is less than 0.75 or the length of the maximum gap over the segment is greater than 30 days. <lb/>A QA value of 3 (low quality) is assigned if the correlation coefficient is less than 0.75 and the length of the maxi-<lb/>mum gap over the segment is greater than 30 days. A QA value of 4 is assigned if no growth cycles were detected <lb/>or insufficient data were available to run the algorithm. <lb/>Data Records <lb/>The PlanetScope Land Surface Phenology (PLSP) dataset 34 consists of 24 data layers (Table 2) and spans 5 years <lb/>(2017-2021) for each site. Each site and year of data is saved in a single Network Common Data Form (netCDF) <lb/>file, and the dataset is permanently and publicly available through the Oak Ridge National Lab Distributed <lb/>Active Archive Centre for Biogeochemical Dynamics (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2033). <lb/>The structure of the dataset is as follows: <lb/>&lt;Site Code__Site Full Name&gt; <lb/>└─── PSLP_&lt;Year&gt;.nc <lb/>Here, &quot;Site Code&quot; and &quot;Site Full Name&quot; are the AmeriFlux site code and full site name, respectively, as pre-<lb/>sented in Table 1, and &quot;Year&quot; is the year of the estimated LSP metric from 2017 to 2021. Each netCDF file <lb/>includes all 24 data layers for each year. Note that even though the PlanetScope imagery we use to create this <lb/>Fig. 4 Phenological cycles at the Bouldin Island (Alfalfa) site (US-Bi1) in 2019.

			<body>dataset starts in 2016, we exclude this year from the PLSP dataset because the density of EVI2 times series is too <lb/>sparse to estimate phenometrics with high confidence. To facilitate access to the location and boundary of each <lb/>site, we include the GeoJSON file for each site as ancillary data. <lb/>technical Validation <lb/>A detailed technical validation of LSP metrics from PlanetScope imagery is presented in Moon et al. 26 . Results <lb/>from that study demonstrated that LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope image times series show strong <lb/>agreement with LSP records derived from both HLS and PhenoCams, and that LSP metrics from PlanetScope <lb/>capture information related to fine-scale variation in LSP that is not captured in medium or coarse spatial res-<lb/>olution LSP datasets 26 . Below we present additional validation that extends these previous results for the sites <lb/>included in the PLSP dataset. First, we present images showing the mid-greenup date (50PCGI) and the EVI2 <lb/>seasonal amplitude for three representative sites included in the dataset. Second, we present results showing <lb/>the timing of peak EVI2 and associated PhenoCam images at the Jornada LTER site (US-xJR), which does not <lb/>exhibit a clear annual cycle of vegetation activity. Third, we present phenological cycles at the Bouldin Island <lb/>Alfalfa site (US-Bi1) to illustrate how our algorithm handles an extreme case with multiple growth cycles within <lb/>a year. Fourth, we compare mid-greenup and mid-greendown dates (i.e., 50PCGI and 50PCGD, respectively) <lb/>from PlanetScope imagery against an independent LSP dataset derived from HLS time series. Specifically, we <lb/>compare the PLSP dataset against V011 of the MSLSP30NA 31 data product (hereafter, MSLSP), which is pub-<lb/>licly available via NASA&apos;s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Centre. Fifth, we compare 50PCGI and <lb/>50PCGD from the PLSP dataset against corresponding values estimated from PhenoCam G CC time series. <lb/>Figure 2 shows representative images showing PLSP greenup dates and the seasonal amplitude of EVI2 <lb/>for three sites with different landscapes included in the dataset. Each site has a land cover type (assigned <lb/>by AmeriFlux) that is representative of the flux tower footprint. However, as is evident in these images, the <lb/>10 × 10 km 2 areas surrounding these sites include a range of vegetation and land cover, which are manifested in <lb/>the LSP data. For example, the primary land cover type for the US-Ro5 site (first column in Fig. 2) is cropland <lb/>and greenup dates for most of the area surrounding the tower at the centre of the image occur around DOY 170. <lb/>However, non-cropland areas (particularly in riparian areas) show greenup dates that are several weeks earlier, <lb/>which reflects the impact of land management on vegetation phenology at the site. Further, the high spatial reso-<lb/>lution of PlanetScope imagery captures fine-scale spatial variation in land surface phenology related to fine-scale <lb/>variation in land cover (i.e., vegetated versus non-vegetated areas) associated with buildings, roads, and small <lb/>water bodies. At the US-NC2 site (second column in Fig. 2), pine plantations (green and purple in the top row) <lb/>show earlier greenup dates with low seasonal EVI2 amplitudes, while croplands show later greenup dates with <lb/>large EVI2 amplitudes. The third column in Fig. 2 shows LSP images centred over AmeriFlux site US-Tw5, <lb/>which is located in a wetland and is surrounded by heterogeneous land cover that includes a mix of wetlands, <lb/>Fig. 5 Comparison of PLSP and MSLSP metrics. Each plot compares average values for randomly selected 3 × 3 <lb/>pixel windows in the MSLSP dataset against average values for co-located 30 × 30 pixel windows from the PLSP <lb/>dataset (i.e., 90 by 90 m windows). Acronyms for the various LSP metrics are given in Table 2. <lb/></body>

			<body>croplands, natural vegetation, and water bodies. Again, the LSP metrics in the PLSP dataset capture fine-scale <lb/>variation in LSP across the site. <lb/>Figure 3 presents PLSP images showing the timing maximum EVI2 at the Jornada LTER site in 2017, 2018, and <lb/>2021 (first row), PhenoCam images on dates corresponding to maximum EVI2 from PlanetScope (second row), and <lb/>EVI2 time series from PlanetScope for 2017-2021 (third row). Phenology at this site shows either weak seasonality or <lb/>no clear annual cycle of vegetation activity over the five-year period. In 2017, only 15% of pixels in the 10 by 10 km site <lb/>exhibited sufficient phenological variation to be detected by the PLSP algorithm (i.e., 15% of pixels exhibited seasonal <lb/>EVI2 amplitudes that exceeded 0.1). In 2018, less than 1% of pixels met this criterion. In contrast, over 75% of pixels <lb/>in the site exhibited a measurable phenological cycle in 2021. This pattern is corroborated by PhenoCam images cor-<lb/>responding to the date of maximum PlanetScope EVI2 that are shown in the second row of Fig. 3, and demonstrates <lb/>how the PLSP dataset is able to capture relatively subtle year-to-year variation in phenology. <lb/>Figure 4 shows PLSP and PhenoCam data from the US-Bi1 site, which is dominated by croplands and includes a <lb/>variety of crop species. The PhenoCam&apos;s field of view faces a field with alfalfa (second row), a crop with short growth <lb/>cycles (generally less than two months) that is harvested multiple times per year. Corn fields occupy most of the land-<lb/>scape, exhibit relatively uniform phenology with one growth cycle, and have 50PCGI dates that range from DOY 150 <lb/>to 190 (first row). PlanetScope EVI2 and PhenoCam G CC time series both capture the short growth cycles of alfalfa <lb/>(i.e., six growth cycles in 2019; third row). However, due to heuristics encoded in our algorithm (among others, that <lb/>the start of each growth cycle is restricted to occur at least 30 days prior to the peak), the algorithm used to create <lb/>the PLSP dataset does not provide a realistic representation of phenology for the alfalfa fields at this site (i.e., most <lb/>pixels assigned as alfalfa are estimated to have three growth cycles, and the dataset provides phenometrics for only <lb/>two growth cycles). That said, PlanetScope EVI2 time series clearly capture phenological dynamics in the field that <lb/>are consistent with ground-based PhenoCam G CC data. Hence, it should be possible to adjust our algorithm in future <lb/>versions of the dataset to account for locations with more than two growing seasons each year. <lb/>Figure 5 provides a comprehensive comparison of DOY phenometrics estimated from the MSLSP and PLSP <lb/>datasets that includes data from 101 sites and six day-of-year phenometrics. Three sites were excluded (in Hawaii <lb/>and Puerto Rico) because they were outside of the geographic coverage of the MSLSP dataset. This comparison <lb/>uses average values from co-located 3 × 3 pixel windows from MSLSP images and 30 × 30 pixel windows from <lb/>PLSP images (i.e., covering 90 by 90 m windows for both datasets) for 100,000 randomly sampled points across <lb/>all sites from 2017 to 2019. Overall, there was strong agreement between LSP metrics from the PLPS and MSLSP <lb/>datasets: the minimum correlation (r) is 0.83; the maximum root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 26 days; and <lb/>the maximum bias (i.e., PLSP -MSLSP) is −7.2 days. Agreement was strongest for LSP metrics corresponding <lb/>to the timing of maximum greenness and 50% greenup and greendown (i.e., OGMx, 50PCGI and 50PCGD, <lb/>respectively), and was weakest for LSP metrics representing the start and end of growing seasons (i.e., OGI and <lb/>OGMn), which showed modestly lower agreement and higher RMSEs. These lower agreements for OGI and <lb/>OGMn can be attributed to the fact that these metrics are most susceptible to artefacts from image processing <lb/>such as screening for snow-and cloud-contaminated pixels and determination of background EVI2 values. <lb/>As a final basis for assessing the PLSLP dataset, we compared phenometrics from PlanetScope to correspond-<lb/>ing phenometrics from PhenoCam G CC time series (Fig. 6). Across 5 years of PLSP measurements and 101 sites, <lb/>the comparison includes PhenoCam imagery from 207 individual cameras (Supplementary Table 1), yielding <lb/>803 and 816 site-years of greenup and geendown dates, respectively. To perform this comparison, we used the <lb/>average value of PLSP metrics for 5 × 5 pixel windows located 30 m north of each PhenoCam camera. We used <lb/>this strategy because over 75% of the PhenoCams we used are oriented to face north. (Supplementary Table 1). <lb/>And, given their proximity, the same PLSP value was used for comparisons of phenometrics from multiple ROIs <lb/>within a single camera scene. Consistent with results comparing LSP metrics from the PLSP dataset against LSP <lb/>metrics from the MSLSP dataset (i.e., Fig. 5), there is strong agreement between PLSP data and phenometrics <lb/>from PhenoCam (r ≥ 0.87; RMSE ≤ 25 days; absolute bias ≤ 4.5 days). Note that even though phenometrics from <lb/>PhenoCam and both PLSP and MSLSP are derived from different vegetation indices (i.e., G CC versus EVI2), <lb/>Fig. 6 Comparison between PLSP and PhenoCam phenometrics. The comparison is based on average values <lb/>for 5 × 5 pixel windows from PLSP images centred over each PhenoCam (i.e., 15 by 15 m). Colors indicate the <lb/>IGBP land cover class assigned to each site by AmeriFlux or NEON. <lb/></body>

			<body>previous studies have demonstrated that phenological metrics derived from these two data sources show strong <lb/>agreement 19,26 . Hence, once again, these results support the conclusion that LSP metrics included in the PLSLP <lb/>dataset accurately capture the seasonality of vegetation activity at high spatial resolution across the sites included <lb/>in the dataset. <lb/>Usage Notes <lb/>At the time we processed the data (i.e., early 2022), time series of PlanetScope imagery did not cover the first <lb/>six months of 2022. Hence, time series of EVI2 data did not cover the full period required by our algorithm to <lb/>retrieve phenometrics in 2021. To overcome this, we used EVI2 time series data from 2021 in place of data that <lb/>had not yet been acquired (i.e., we filled data from February to June in 2022 using data from 2021). To evaluate <lb/>the impact of this strategy, we performed a sensitivity analysis (results not shown), which indicated that this <lb/>approach had minimal impact on the quality of phenometrics in 2021. Also, unfortunately, our license agree-<lb/>ment prevents us from distributing the quality-controlled and gap-filled EVI2 time series that we generated as <lb/>intermediate products, which might also be useful to the community. As a compromise, all the source code that <lb/>we used to generate these data are publicly available on our GitHub repository (see below), which allows inter-<lb/>ested readers to generate these data themselves. <lb/></body>
