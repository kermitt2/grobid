Email: jostein.starrfelt@ibv.uio.no <lb/>Abstract <lb/>The fossil record is a rich source of information about biological diversity in the past. However, the fossil <lb/>record is not only incomplete but has inherent biases due to geological, physical, chemical and biological <lb/>factors such that not all individuals or species are equally likely to be discovered at any point in time or <lb/>space. In order to use the fossil record to reconstruct temporal dynamics of diversity, biased sampling <lb/>must be explicitly taken into account. Here, we introduce an approach that utilizes the variation in the <lb/>number of times each species is observed in the fossil record to estimate both sampling bias and true <lb/>richness. We term our technique TRiPS (True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model) and <lb/>explore its robustness to violation of its assumptions via simulations before applying it to an empirical <lb/>dataset. We then venture to estimate sampling bias and absolute species richness of dinosaurs in the <lb/>geological stages of the Mesozoic. Using TRiPS, we present new estimates of species richness trajectories <lb/>of the three major dinosaur clades; the sauropods, ornithischians and theropods, casting doubt on the <lb/>Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event and demonstrating that all dinosaur groups are subject to <lb/>considerable sampling bias throughout the Mesozoic. <lb/>Keywords: Dinosauria, Poisson, taxonomic richness, fossil record, sampling bias, Ornithischia, <lb/>Sauropodomorpha, Theropoda, diversity curve. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>One of the main goals of paleobiology is to reconstruct diversity using information from the fossil record. <lb/>While the patterns of diversity in space and through time are interesting in themselves, understanding the <lb/>dynamics of taxon richness is also the first step in elucidating the biotic and abiotic forces that shape the <lb/>spatial and temporal variation in taxon diversity. In other words, we need an accurate picture of patterns <lb/>of past diversity to understand processes that operate on long time scales. As in all study systems where <lb/>data samples in themselves cannot be assumed a complete picture of the underlying population, richness <lb/>studies based on the fossil record must consider the incompleteness of the fossil record. <lb/>Not all organisms enter the fossil record or have the same potential of doing so. Once created, a fossil <lb/>record (a physical record of the existence of organisms that were alive in the past) is subject to eternal <lb/>loss through erosion, subduction and other physical processes. Whether or not a fossilized organism can <lb/>be found is also affected by variability in outcrop accessibility. Last but not least, sampling intensity <lb/>encompassing factors including academic/commercial interest, geographic location and sampling design <lb/>also influence information from the fossil record we have access to. While some of these factors <lb/>contribute to noise in our inference of historical patterns and processes, and thus only cloud biological <lb/>signals, some may cause systematic bias so as to yield misleading results if the data are interpreted at face <lb/>value or with inappropriate methods. <lb/>Several classes of approaches for estimating richness using an incomplete fossil record have been <lb/>developed. These might be loosely grouped into subsampling approaches, phylogenetic corrections and <lb/>residual approaches. It is not our purpose to give a full overview of the approaches available, which have <lb/>variously been reviewed elsewhere (see e.g. 1,2), but we briefly describe these in order to clarify why we <lb/>have developed a new approach here. Subsampling approaches, including rarefaction (reviewed in 1) and <lb/>SQS (3,4), attempt to standardize temporal (or spatial) samples so as to achieve comparable relative <lb/>richness across samples. Phylogenetic approaches use phylogenetic hypotheses of the clade in question to <lb/>infer ghost lineages that are not observed in the fossil record but did exist as implied by the given <lb/>phylogenetic hypothesis (5). These ghost lineages are thus assumed to give a minimum estimate of the <lb/>lineages we have failed to observe in the fossil record. The residual approach (see also many chapters in <lb/>McGowan &amp; Smith 2,6,7) assumes that a given proxy for sampling (e.g. outcrop area or number of fossil <lb/>bearing collections) captures the biases that might influence our observations and uses that to model how <lb/>a completely sampling-driven signal would appear. Deviations from such a model are thought to reveal <lb/>the real troughs and peaks in richness. In all of these three approaches, we can only hope to estimate <lb/>relative richness through time and not true richness. Additionally, none of these approaches attempts to <lb/>estimate the bias itself, i.e. the differential sampling across time, space or taxa. Without an estimate of <lb/>sampling bias that is separate from richness estimates, it is not possible to use these approaches to shed <lb/>light on the Common Cause Hypothesis; where a common factor affects both biological dynamics and <lb/>sampling (8,9). <lb/>Here, we introduce an approach that explicitly models the sampling process while estimating richness, <lb/>using multiple observations of fossils belonging to an organismal group. We named it TRiPS (True <lb/>Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model). While we and others have used the simultaneous <lb/>estimation of extinction, speciation and sampling processes to study diversification processes (10-13), <lb/>there has not been a direct attempt to use multiple observations of fossil species to estimate true richness, <lb/>rather than relative richness,while simultaneously and explicitly estimating sampling, as far as we are <lb/>aware. Specifically, TRiPS assumes that a particular species, if observed multiple times in a given time <lb/>interval, has a relatively high probability of fossilization and modern day discovery. We use this type of <lb/>information across related species that are likely to have similar fossilization potential and modern day <lb/>discovery rates to estimate the number of species we might be missing and hence the true number of <lb/>
			species that might have existed. <lb/>Dinosaurs are used as an example to illustrate our approach, not least because there is a lot of interest in <lb/>estimating the both the absolute (14-16) and relative temporal richness (17-21) of dinosaur taxa. As <lb/>earlier analyses suggests that the three major dinosaur groups Sauropodomorpha, Ornithischia and <lb/>Theropoda exhibit both different diversity dynamics and differential impact of sampling bias (e.g. 7,22), <lb/>we estimate sampling rates and true richness for all dinosaurs as well as these groups independently. We <lb/>present stage-specific dinosaur sampling rates (i.e. bias) and dinosaur species richness through the <lb/>Mesozoic as estimated from TRiPS, compare our estimates with those discussed in the literature and <lb/>present simulations that explore the power of our approach and the sensitivity of TRiPS to violations of <lb/>key assumptions. <lb/>Methods and data. <lb/>Data <lb/>We downloaded records of Dinosauria, Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda separately from <lb/>the Paleobiology Database (PaleoDB, https://paleobiodb.org/#/, download August 13 th 2015) using the R <lb/>toolbox paleobioDB (23). Each row of data downloaded from the PaleoDB is associated with an observed <lb/>taxon, its location and age range, and their metadata. Only data where identifications were made to the <lb/>species level and where reported age ranges were specified to stage level were in used in our subsequent <lb/>analyses. Note that while most of the Dinosauria records were assigned to Ornithischia, <lb/>Sauropodomorpha or Theropoda, 179 occurrences representing 67 species are not associated with any of <lb/>these groupings. We summarize the data in Table 1 but also supply the raw data we downloaded as <lb/>supporting information. For each species we tallied the number of observations in each stage in the <lb/>Mesozoic, generating an observation count matrix. The reported age range of a given record can span <lb/>several geological stages. In such cases, we assigned a stage within its age range with a probability that is <lb/>proportional to the duration of those stages. Because of this random assignment of records to stages <lb/>within the given age range, we performed TRiPS analyses (described below) on 100 replicated occurrence <lb/>count matrices and used the median estimated sampling rate for species richness estimation. We also <lb/>analyzed genus level data but because both richness and sampling dynamics are similar to species level <lb/>dynamics, we refer readers to the SI for genus level estimates. <lb/>Model: Fossil sampling as a Poisson process <lb/>Here, we treat the process of fossil sampling, which we will estimate from records from the PaleoDB (see <lb/>previous section) as the combined processes of fossilization and detection. We assume that sampling can <lb/>be viewed as a homogenous Poisson process inside a particular time interval. For our data, the Poisson <lb/>intensity or rate at which species are sampled is assumed constant for the duration of a geological stage. <lb/>Formally, let the Poisson intensity Î» t be the parameter controlling the sampling process in a given time <lb/>interval t. The number of observations O i,t for a species i in that time interval t with duration d t has a <lb/>Poisson distribution with mean Î» t d t . The likelihood of the sampling rate Î» t given O i,t occurrences in that <lb/>interval is then <lb/>| , , <lb/>= <lb/>, <lb/>, ! <lb/>(1) <lb/>Here we explicitly assume that a species detected in a time interval is extant during that whole time <lb/>interval. Because any species that is represented in the database must have left at least one detected fossil <lb/>we must condition the likelihood of Î» t on O i,t &gt; 0. The likelihood of Î» t is then <lb/>| , , <lb/>= <lb/>, <lb/>, ! <lb/>1 â <lb/>(2) <lb/>The maximum likelihood estimate for the sampling rate of a group of species in a given interval is found <lb/>by maximizing the product of eq (2) over all the observed species (n t ) belonging to that group; <lb/>= max <lb/>, <lb/>, ! <lb/>1 â <lb/>(3) <lb/>If our data consist of only single records (i.e. O i,t = 1, for all i), estimating using maximum likelihood <lb/>will yield an estimate of 0. Hence, the minimum data requirement for estimating the fossilization rate is a <lb/>dataset where at least one of the species has more than one observation. <lb/>We assume that sampling rates estimated are constant for all species within a clade in the same time <lb/>interval (i.e. the sampling rates estimated are time-specific but not species-specific). We can then <lb/>
			estimate the probability of detecting a species from this group as 1-Poiss(0, *dt), i.e. 1 minus the <lb/>probability of not detecting a species if it was actually extant, according to the Poisson process. We <lb/>further use this binomial probability in deriving the most likely true richness. The binomial probability of <lb/>a species sampled during an interval d t is <lb/>! &quot; #$, = 1 â %&amp;&apos;(( 0, <lb/>= 1 â <lb/>* <lb/>(4) <lb/>where Poiss(0, d t ) is the probability of 0 sampling events in one lineage with a rate in a bin of <lb/>duration d t . The last step in estimating the true richness in a given time interval is to find the true species <lb/>richness (n true ) that maximizes the binomial likelihood <lb/>+ ,-. | ! &quot; #$, , + = / <lb/>+ ,-. <lb/>+ 0 ! &quot; #$, <lb/>1 â ! &quot; #$, <lb/>123 <lb/>(5) <lb/>where p binom,t is the binomial probability calculated from the estimated sampling intensity (eq 4) using <lb/>maximum likelihood (eq 3) and n t is the observed number of species in the time interval. Thus the value <lb/>n true that maximizes eq 5 is the maximum likelihood estimate of the true richness where n t species were <lb/>observed. <lb/>To quantify the uncertainty surrounding the estimate of the sampling rate and the true species richness we <lb/>utilize the relationship between the Ï 2 distribution and log likelihood profiles (see e.g. 24). For the <lb/>confidence bounds on the maximum likelihood estimate we find the range of values for Î» that satisfy <lb/>the inequality <lb/>2 /log / 8 | , , <lb/>0 â log / <lb/>| , , <lb/>00 &lt; : ; &lt; <lb/>(6) <lb/>where : ; &lt; is the upper quantile function of the Ï 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Similarly the <lb/>upper and lower confidence bounds for the estimated true richness + ,-. is found using the lower and <lb/>upper confidence bounds on the sampling probability (p binom,t ) summarizing the uncertainty surrounding <lb/>both sampling and richness estimates. <lb/>TRiPS thus yields maximum likelihood estimates and confidence intervals of true species richness for a <lb/>given time interval by estimating a sampling rate (detected fossils per species per million year). This <lb/>sampling rate can be transformed into a time interval specific sampling probability (probability of fossil <lb/>detection per species) and thereby appropriately take the duration of time interval into account. In other <lb/>words, we do not need to conform the data to equal durations as commonly done (18,e.g. 25). The <lb/>sampling rates estimated from TRiPS are thus directly comparable across unequal geological intervals. <lb/>Note that while we have described TRiPS using species observations it can also be directly applied to <lb/>genera or lineages defined in other ways. In fact, groupings believed to exhibit similar sampling rates <lb/>might be combined, whether or not they actually are taxonomic clades. <lb/>We estimate the sampling rates and richness for all dinosaurs and Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha and <lb/>Theropoda in each geological stage in the Mesozoic, data permitting. <lb/>Simulations using a birth-death-fossilization process <lb/>To evaluate our method&apos;s applicability and power we performed a large number of continuous time birth-<lb/>death (BD) simulations, coupled with a fossilization scheme, which we interpret as sampling. In a classic <lb/>BD process a lineage either gives rise to a new species or goes extinct at a certain rate; our fossilization <lb/>scheme adds a third potential event: that of a lineage leaving a fossil. We are thus simulating a &apos;fossil <lb/>record&apos; given a set of parameters controlling the dynamics and sampling of the simulated clade, and then <lb/>using TRiPS to estimate the true number of species in these simulations. Our birth-death-fossilize model <lb/>has 6 parameters which we all will vary; speciation and extinction rate (in per species per time unit), <lb/>sampling rate (fossils per species per time unit), number of species at the start of the simulation and <lb/>number of time units (in continuous time) to run the simulation. The final parameter scales the variability <lb/>of sampling rates between individual species; where the sampling rate is a clade mean and each species <lb/>has a sampling rate drawn from a normal distribution with a given coefficient of variation. For our <lb/>simulations these 6 parameters were either set to zero or drawn from a given distribution. <lb/>In case of no biological dynamics and identical sampling rates for all lineages TRiPS will consistently <lb/>recover true richness. In two rounds of simulations, we explicitly investigate the robustness of our <lb/>approach to violations of TRiPS&apos;s two main assumptions, 1) equal sampling rates for all species in the <lb/>clade in question and 2) and negligible species turnover within a time interval. We then use the results of <lb/>our simulations to aid interpretation of our estimates based on dinosaur records. <lb/>In the first round of simulations speciation and extinction rates were set to 0 (i.e. no changes in species <lb/>richness), durations of time simulated ranged from 1 to 20 time units (uniform distribution), the number <lb/>of species between 10 and 500 (uniform distribution), mean sampling rates from 0.002 to 1.5 fossils per <lb/>species per time unit (log uniform distribution), coefficient of variation of sampling rate across species <lb/>from 0 to 0.1 (uniform distribution). Each species thus has its own unique sampling rate drawn from a <lb/>normal distribution with means and variance differing across simulations. We ran 1000 simulations in this <lb/>set. <lb/>
			The second round of simulations we simulated BD process with speciation and extinction rates &gt; 0 which <lb/>leads to species turnover. Speciation and extinction rates were drawn from log-uniform distributions <lb/>spanning 0.005 to 0.158 per species per time unit and interval durations ranging from 2 to 20 time units <lb/>(uniform distribution). The number of initial species was also varied in the range 10 through 250 (uniform <lb/>distribution). Mean sampling rates of all species were allowed to vary from 0.01 to 0.5 fossils per species <lb/>per time unit (log uniform). As in the first round, we also varied the variability in sampling across species <lb/>within a simulation (coefficient of variation in the range 0 to 0.1, uniform distribution). We ran 100.000 <lb/>simulations in which the parameter values were sampled using a latin-square hypercube to best span all <lb/>combinations of parameters. We tracked the records of observations of species through time, and then <lb/>analyzed these data with TRiPS. These simulations allowed us to explore the effects of violating TRiPS&apos;s <lb/>assumption that a species, if found in a given time interval, is extant during the entire time interval. We <lb/>evaluated TRiPS&apos;s ability to infer sampling rates and true species richness by 1) tabulating the number of <lb/>simulations in which the true species richness was inside the predicted confidence interval and 2) <lb/>estimating the bias in the maximum likelihood prediction of species richness <lb/>= &gt;,. ? . â = @? -@A = @? -@A <lb/>â <lb/>. Details and code for the simulations are presented in the supporting <lb/>information, and also available on the websites of the authors. <lb/>Implementation <lb/>All aspects of the data analysis was performed in R (R Core Team 26). Code necessary for the analysis, <lb/>combined with scripts to directly download relevant (and thus updated) data from Paleobiology Database <lb/>will be made available on the authors&apos; website (or other appropriate repository). The birth-death-fossilize <lb/>model was implemented and analyzed in MatLab (27) and code and simulation data are also available. <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Why (and when to) use TRiPS to estimate richness: simulations and comparisons <lb/>Estimating taxon richness using data collected from the fossil record and compiled into databases, such as <lb/>the PaleoDB, is not a trivial exercise as fossilization, outcrop exposure and modern day sampling and data <lb/>compilation are heterogeneous processes. The approach we have developed capitalize on the readily <lb/>availability of fossil observation data in the PaleoDB. Unlike commonly used approaches, including <lb/>subsampling (1,25,28) and bias-corrected residual analysis (7,29), that also use such data, our approach, <lb/>TRiPS, estimates true rather than relative richness by utilizing information on sampling which is inherent <lb/>in PaleoDB. In addition, unlike the residual approach, we do not make presuppositions that an external <lb/>time series can be used to correct for sampling. This is important because such external time series (e.g. <lb/>amount of outcrop, sea level) may constitute a factor driving both richness and sampling as postulated by <lb/>the Common Cause Hypothesis (8,9) or be an effect of such a third factor. Also, in some cases, assumed <lb/>proxy time series can be dubious; for instance using formation counts as a sampling proxy there will <lb/>always be a correlation between proxy and richness, regardless of the degree of sampling (30,31) <lb/>In TRiPS, we tackle bias in the fossil record directly by estimating rates of sampling. This also allows us <lb/>to disentangle sampling and richness dynamics such that tests of links between potential drivers can be <lb/>done on sampling and richness independently (see also 32). An advantage of TRiPS is that our treatment <lb/>of sampling allows sampling probabilities to be directly comparable between intervals of unequal <lb/>duration. One assumption we do explicitly make which cannot be true most of the time, is that a species <lb/>detected in a given time interval is extant during that whole time interval. This is because most species are <lb/>unlikely to become extinct exactly at the late boundary of a time interval or originate exactly at the early <lb/>boundary of a time interval. While other methods for estimating richness also assume that turnover is <lb/>clumped at interval boundaries (see e.g. 28, p. 74), we do need to examine the robustness of our estimates <lb/>to the violation of this crucial assumption. <lb/>Our first round simulations show that when speciation and extinction rates are 0 (and hence where there <lb/>are no changes in species richness through time) but species in the group are allowed to vary in their <lb/>sampling rates, TRiPS still work remarkably well with more than 98% of our 1000 simulations yielding <lb/>confidence intervals of richness that included the true richness value, with no clustering of the &apos;failures&apos; <lb/>in any part of parameter space. Hence, even if species vary in their potential for fossilization and <lb/>detection, TRiPS still yields adequate results. <lb/>In the second round, where speciation and extinction rates are not zero, most simulated species do not <lb/>span the whole interval in which they were sampled. Across the whole parameter space simulated (see <lb/>previous section) TRiPS analysis yielded confidence intervals including the true richness in 71% of <lb/>simulations and true sampling rates were inside the confidence interval in 67% of simulations (see SI for <lb/>effect of all parameter ranges on the success). In other words, TRiPS has reasonable success at capturing <lb/>true species richness despite large deviations from the assumption that species are extant throughout the <lb/>time interval they were sampled in, i.e. even with turnover within a time interval. At moderate levels of <lb/>sampling and shorter durations (of time intervals) TRiPS works very well (Fig 1). <lb/>While richness dynamics within time intervals reduce the probability of correct inferences of both <lb/>sampling rates and true richness according to TRiPS, cases in which true values fall outside of estimated <lb/>confidence intervals are not unreasonable: across such &quot;failure&quot; cases, the correlations between estimated <lb/>and true sampling and richness are 0.91 and 0.93 respectively, and the mean bias in the estimated richness <lb/>is smaller than across all that are deemed &apos;successful&apos;. Many cases of &apos;failure&apos; seem to be due to an <lb/>unwarranted narrowness of confidence intervals rather than a complete breakdown of approach. <lb/>We note two caveats to the estimates from TRiPS. First, although the ability to estimate proper bounds on <lb/>richness is relatively robust to deviations from our assumptions under our simulations, TRiPS does give <lb/>biased maximum likelihood estimates of richness when there are within-bin dynamics such that estimates <lb/>are usually lower than the true richness (see Fig SI 3). The estimated richness is thus best treated as <lb/>possibly minimum richness estimate, particularly for intervals in which there is reason to believe that the <lb/>changes in true richness have been substantial, such as in long geological stages. Second, with longer <lb/>
			simulations (which gives more time for in-bin dynamics) and higher sampling, rates TRiPS fails more <lb/>often (Fig. 1). On the other hand, one of the benefits of our explicit approach is that it is straightforward <lb/>to simulate a birth-death-fossilization process and check whether or not the empirical estimates of <lb/>sampling rates and richness can be thought to be robust to violation of the assumption of negligible <lb/>turnover within an interval (see below). It is also worth highlighting that other approaches for <lb/>reconstructing past richness also fall victim to deviations from constant richness (see e.g. 28), even <lb/>though such violations have not been explicitly examined by published simulations as far as we know. <lb/>Varying sampling estimates among clades and through time <lb/>The sampling estimates from TRiPS (Fig. 2 and Table 1) clearly show that sampling rates and <lb/>probabilities for dinosaurs do not monotonically increase through the Mesozoic, but exhibit a <lb/>combination of high and low sampling regimes. This observation runs counter to the common held belief <lb/>that younger geological strata exhibit a higher level of fossil sampling (e.g. 17,19). Sampling probabilities <lb/>are particularly high during the first two stages of Jurassic (Hettangian (201.3 -199.3 Myr) and <lb/>Sinemurian (199.3-190.8 Myr)), the Tithonian (152.1-145 Myr), the Albian (113-100.5 Myr) and the <lb/>Maastrichtian (72.1-66 Myr) but these high sampling intervals are interspersed with lower ones. Note that <lb/>sampling rates (Î») and sampling probabilities (! &quot; #$, ) while sharing some commonalities, are not the <lb/>same. For instance, the Norian (Nor) has relatively low sampling rates (Î» t ), i.e. sampling events per <lb/>lineage per million years, but the probability of a species being sampled, given that it was extant in the <lb/>Norian is quite high (&gt;0.74 for all groups, see Table 1). In general, the relative changes in sampling <lb/>dynamics are similar for our genus level analyses although sampling rates and probabilities are naturally <lb/>higher for genera (SI Fig 6 &amp; 7). <lb/>Our sampling estimates are often quite different across boundaries for which high taxon turnovers have <lb/>been noticed previously. For instance, sampling estimates are low in the Rhaetian (208.5-201.3 Myr) but <lb/>high in the Hettangian (201.3-199.3 Myr), indicating that differential sampling processes were occurring <lb/>across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. The Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary (Tithonian-Berriasian) also <lb/>shows a significant drop in sampling, indicating that the previously noted diversity loss (17) may, at least <lb/>in part, be a sampling signal. While our estimates corroborate that the last two stages of the late <lb/>Cretaceous have high sampling rates (7,18,33), the Santonian has extremely low sampling rates, at odds <lb/>with a previous analysis of sampling bias (22). The Hettangian exhibits very high sampling rates, which <lb/>leads to binomial sampling probabilities at the same level as the following Sinemurian stage, despite the <lb/>Sinemurian lasting almost five times as long. <lb/>The three clades have notably different sampling estimates from stage to stage and also when compared <lb/>with one another, with binomial sampling probabilities spanning from about 0.1 to almost 1. Theropods <lb/>show higher sampling rates relative to ornithischians and sauropods in Triassic but much lower rates in <lb/>the early stages of the Cretaceous. This runs counter to earlier conclusions that richness trajectories of <lb/>Theropoda and Ornithischia seems to largely be driven by sampling bias, whereas sauropodomorphs are <lb/>less affected by bias in the fossil record (21,22). <lb/>Comparing our empirical sampling rate estimates with the second set of simulations that violated key <lb/>assumptions of TRiPS (Fig. 1), we find most of our empirical estimates fall within parameter ranges in <lb/>which we are able to retrieve true richness estimates reliably. This is with the caveat that the simulated <lb/>speciation and extinction rates are realistic for dinosaurs. <lb/>Our estimates of differential sampling across stages give a very different picture of bias than what the <lb/>residual approach would. To reiterate, the residual approach assumes that a chosen external time series <lb/>fully captures the sampling bias, and uses a model of fixed diversity to predict how richness would look if <lb/>only biased sampling drove the detected signal. In many cases, at least for dinosaurs, the number of fossil <lb/>collections from different intervals that contains at least one dinosaur (DBCs) are often used as a proxy <lb/>for sampling (19,22,34). DBC should capture some of the sampling bias inherent in the dinosaur fossil <lb/>record, but a valid question is how much sampling bias it captures. To explore this, we compare our <lb/>proxy-free sampling estimates to DBCs. We performed correlation tests of the binomial sampling <lb/>probabilities estimated and the linearly detrended log10 number of collections for all downloaded <lb/>dinosaur occurrences. Pearson product-moment correlations for the four taxonomic groups were: 0.55 <lb/>(p&lt;0.003), 0.51 (p&lt;0.019), 0.69 (p&lt; 0.001) and 0.68 (p&lt;0.001), for Dinosauria, Ornithischia, <lb/>Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda sampling probabilities, respectively, indicating that there is a common <lb/>signal in DBCs and our estimated sampling probabilities. However, not only is there remaining sampling <lb/>bias not captured by DBC introducing noise (since correlations are &lt;1), but possibly also adding bias if <lb/>used in richness estimation of dinosaurs. <lb/>Dinosaur richness during the Mesozoic <lb/>The species richness estimates from TRiPS shares dynamics with those painted by both the raw counts of <lb/>species and range-through species richness using the same dataset (Fig 3A). However, only in about half <lb/>the stages are the range-through estimates within the confidence interval of TRiPS estimates. Genus <lb/>richness dynamics are similar to species dynamics (SI figure) and indicate that for at least this dataset <lb/>using these analyses, genus level estimates can be a proxy for species estimates, corroborating Jablonski <lb/>and Finarell (35)&apos;s findings. While genus richness estimates are lower, they are similar to species <lb/>estimates, unsurprisingly given there are few dinosaur species per genera (1.38 identified species per <lb/>genera in our data). Earlier attempts to estimate true taxon richness using ecological richness estimators <lb/>(e.g. 14), species-area curves (16,36) and using estimated durations of genera in a diversification <lb/>framework (15), they do not explicitly estimate sampling bias. Dodson (1990) estimated the total number <lb/>of dinosaur genera to be 900-1200 for the whole Mesozoic, with about 100 genera at any one geological <lb/>stage. Our estimates are more in line with Wang and Dodson&apos;s (14) estimates of genus richness based on <lb/>the Abundance Coverage Estimator, a metric frequently used in ecology, which inferred that the final <lb/>stages of the Cretaceous saw 200-300 genera of dinosaurs roaming our planet (our estimates are 279 and <lb/>305 genera for Campanian and Maastrichtian respectively (see Fig SI 7)). Wang and Dodson&apos;s (2006) <lb/>mixture of epoch and stage level (late Cretaceous only) genus richness estimates are difficult to compare <lb/>
			directly with our stage level only analysis. They estimated that, across the Mesozoic, genus richness of <lb/>dinosaurs was 1844, with only 527 genera actually having been observed. In our downloaded data there <lb/>are 1272 genera for dinosaurs, showing an immense increase in dinosaur occurrences compiled from the <lb/>literature since 2006. Calculating a mean binomial sampling probability for genera across the Mesozoic <lb/>using our stage specific sampling probabilities (weighted by estimated richness per stage) yields an <lb/>overall binomial probability of 0.80 (0.74 -0.86), and estimates of true number of genera for the whole <lb/>Mesozoic is 1580 (CI: 1448-1761), slightly below Wang &amp; Dodson&apos;s 1844. A Mesozoic mean sampling <lb/>probability at the species level (again, weighted by estimated richness from each stage) yield estimates of <lb/>total dinosaur species richness at 2983 (CI: 2462 -3660). <lb/>The literature on dynamics of dinosaur species richness is vast, varied and sometime contradictory. Rather <lb/>than exhaustively comparing our estimates to those from all of the recent literature, we extract salient <lb/>points from Brusatte&apos;s (17) review for our discussion. According to Brusatte (2012, pg. 247), it is <lb/>currently accepted that dinosaurs did not rapidly diversify when they appeared around the start of the Late <lb/>Triassic. Rather, sauropodomorphs diversified during the final part of the Triassic, while ornithischians <lb/>and theropods increased in richness in the early Jurassic (17,33). While this pattern is in part corroborated <lb/>by our analysis for sauropods, sampling rates for ornithischians cannot be estimated with confidence for <lb/>any interval in the Triassic. In contrast to the received view (17,33), our estimates show that theropods <lb/>underwent diversification already in the Triassic, with estimated species richness being higher in Rhaetian <lb/>than the Hettangian, albeit with rather weak confidence (figure 2, Table 1). Sauropodomorphs, on the <lb/>other hand, exhibit rather high levels of both observed and estimated species richness already in the <lb/>Norian, and our estimate of sauropodomorph species richness during the Rhaetian is so high that it not <lb/>even surpassed by the diversity in the final stages of the Cretaceous, nor the supposed diversity peak in <lb/>the mid-Jurassic (37). In other words, our results indicate that a sauropodomorphs peak is reached in the <lb/>Rhaetian, and not in the Norian as earlier studies (22), due to the estimated low sampling for this clade in <lb/>this final stage of the Triassic. <lb/>The Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary (~145 Myr) is believed to have experienced clear diversity loss <lb/>(17,21,22), which Brusatte (2012) claims is particularly pronounced for Sauropodomorphs. Though the <lb/>observed species counts partially corroborates this, the sampling rates for the early part of the Cretaceous <lb/>are estimated to be much lower than late Jurassic (Fig 2), yielding only very small negative changes in <lb/>absolute species richness in the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary (compare Tithonian and Berriasian in Table <lb/>1) for Sauropodomorpha and no clear signal of richness loss for the other groups. Genus level analyses <lb/>(see Fig SI 7) estimate that the number of Sauropodomorph genera in Berriasian is in fact ~10% higher <lb/>than in the Tithonian. It is also worth emphasizing that the confidence intervals for the estimated species <lb/>diversity are much wider in Berriasian compared to Tithonian, implying that an actual increase in the true <lb/>richness across this boundary cannot be excluded. The fact that the lower sampling rates during the <lb/>Berriasian is clear in all subgroups as well as for all dinosaurs (for both species and genus level analysis) <lb/>suggest that this &quot;clear diversity loss&quot;, might be an artefact of sampling bias and that the &apos;major extinction&apos; <lb/>of dinosaurs across the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary (21,22,37-39) might be less severe than previously <lb/>thought. <lb/>In his review of the dinosaur literature, Brusatte (2012) also states that the dynamics of species richness <lb/>for the whole Mesozoic did not show a continual increase, but rather a collection of troughs and peaks. <lb/>This general statement is corroborated by our estimates. In particular, there is general agreement that not <lb/>only is there no decline in richness prior to the end-Cretaceous extinction, there is in fact a sharp increase <lb/>in diversity in the late Cretaceous (Brusatte 2012). <lb/>This Cretaceous increase in dinosaur diversity has been put in the context of the Cretaceous explosion of <lb/>terrestrial life (termed the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR)) (18,20,40) which saw the rapid rise <lb/>of flowering plants, insects and mammals. It has thus been hypothesized that the radiation of angiosperms <lb/>preceded the late Cretaceous increase in dinosaur diversity (18). Brusatte (2012) and Lloyd et al. (7,18) <lb/>attributes this increase in dinosaur richness in the two final stages of the Cretaceous to a sampling artifact <lb/>since these intervals show a high volume of fossiliferous rocks, thus arguing against the dinosaurs being a <lb/>part of the KTR. Our analysis corroborates Brusatte and Lloyd&apos;s claims that the final two stages both have <lb/>high sampling rates compared to earlier stages in the Late Cretaceous (Fig 2), indicating that, at least for <lb/>theropods and sauropodomorphs, there is little evidence of high diversification during the Late Cretaceous. <lb/>Nevertheless, ornithischians seem to reach an all-time diversity high in the final 20 million years of the <lb/>Cretaceous (Fig 2 and Table 1), increasing from a mere 11 species in the Coniacian to around 177 in the <lb/>Campanian. It is also worth noting that our reconstructed richness trajectory for sauropods shows a <lb/>relatively steady (but shallow) increase in richness the last 60 million years before the end of the <lb/>Cretaceous. Our estimated sampling rates for the Santonian (86.3-83.6 Ma) are remarkably low for all <lb/>groups (also in the preceding stage for sauropodomorphs), which indicates that the high level of diversity <lb/>of ornithischians and theropods was reached earlier (Santonian) than the consensus view that only the two <lb/>last stages of the Cretaceous show elevated richness (17). <lb/>This late Cretaceous increase in dinosaur diversity has also been framed as a debate on whether or not <lb/>dinosaurs showed a decline in species richness prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event <lb/>(7,14,17,20,21,41). Brusatte et al. (2015) argues that, while there was no global long-term decline prior to <lb/>the end-Cretaceous extinction, there is evidence for ceratopsids and hadrosaurids (members of <lb/>Ornithischia) exhibiting declines in both species richness and morphological disparity in the final 15 Ma <lb/>of the Cretaceous (41). On the other hand, Lloyd (2012) claims sauropods and ornithischians both show <lb/>long-term declines throughout most of the Cretaceous while Barrett et al. (21) highlight a negative trend <lb/>in taxic diversity for theropods and ornithischians in the last two stages of the Cretaceous, but suggests a <lb/>&apos;radiation&apos; of sauropods in Late Cretaceous (see also 37). Our analysis indicates that ornithischians <lb/>decreased in richness (about 10 % reduction) in the last stage of the late Cretaceous (Fig 3, Table 1), but <lb/>shows no negative longer-term trend for any of the groups. The apparent trough in richness in the <lb/>Santonian and Coniacian for Sauropodomorphs and Theropods seem to be the result of poor sampling, <lb/>and not a true biological signal (Fig 2, Table 1), and sauropods show a marginal, but steady increase in <lb/>richness across most of the Cretaceous in contrast to their claimed radiation (21,37). <lb/>It is largely accepted that the Oxfordian (163.5-157.3 million years ago) exhibits remarkably low diversity, <lb/>perhaps even the most depauperate stage throughout the Age of the Dinosaurs (7,e.g. 17), and particularly <lb/>so for sauropodomorphs (22). Our approach, in contrast, estimates the sampling probability in this <lb/>particular stage to be the culprit of this trough and especially so for sauropodomorphs (see Fig 3 &amp; Table <lb/>1). Instead of inferring low species richness in this stage, our estimates indicate the sauropodomorph <lb/>richness has quadrupled from the previous stage (Callovian), and a great richness increase is also evident <lb/>in ornithischians and the dinosaurs as a whole. More intense sampling efforts, both in the field and in <lb/>museum collections, and detailed analysis on the observations from the Oxfordian are clearly needed. <lb/>Conclusions and future directions <lb/>To properly paint the picture of past species richness, including the identification of periods of high <lb/>diversification rates and major extinction events, the bias inherent the fossil record that may mislead and <lb/>confound our inferences needs to be taken into account. Here we have detailed TRiPS, a new approach <lb/>for estimating both temporally varying sampling and species richness. The application of TRiPS to a <lb/>global dataset of dinosaur records indicates that several of the commonly held beliefs about the species <lb/>richness trajectory of dinosaurs might be effects of either sampling bias or the use of methods that might <lb/>have introduced new biases to richness estimates through their assumptions. <lb/>As a tool that estimates both sampling rates directly and true richness, TRiPS is pregnant with <lb/>possibilities and have applicability to a range of other paleontological questions. Richness and sampling <lb/>estimates from TRiPS allow us to test the Common Cause Hypothesis in a straightforward manner if <lb/>potential common drivers can be measured in the geological record. Estimates of sampling can be used in <lb/>predicting true ranges of a given species, if we can make the assumption that species have the same <lb/>temporally varying sampling rates. The two forms of sampling estimates may help paleontologists focus <lb/>their sampling and taxonomic efforts in time intervals (or geographic regions) which require most effort <lb/>given the specific questions we wish to answer as a community. While the application of TRiPS we <lb/>demonstrated here attempts to estimate global richness of dinosaurs and its major subclades, TRiPS can <lb/>be applied to any collection of lineages that are assumed or shown to have similar sampling rates, and <lb/>could also be used to estimate taxonomic richness on local to continental contexts. <lb/></body>

Details of the start, <lb/>578 <lb/>end and duration of all intervals used (as downloaded from PaleobioDB) are shown in the first 3 columns. Observed species richness N obs (range <lb/>579 <lb/>through in parenthesis), the maximum likelihood estimated true richness N true (confidence intervals in parenthesis) and the maximum likelihood <lb/>580 <lb/>estimated sampling probability (confidence intervals) are then given for each group in each stage. NA indicates combinations of intervals and <lb/>581 <lb/>groups in which there was not enough data to estimate sampling rates, and thus no estimated true richness. Sampling probabilities in bold indicate <lb/>582 <lb/>estimates outside the range of Fig 1. <lb/></body>
