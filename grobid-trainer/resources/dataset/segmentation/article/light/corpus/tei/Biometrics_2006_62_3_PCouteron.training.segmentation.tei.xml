Such a decomposition provides a structure function, referred to as &quot; orthogram, &quot; which <lb/>is relevant to characterize in both graphical and statistical aspects the dependence of trait values on the <lb/>topology of the tree ( &quot; phylogenetic dependence &quot; ). We also propose four complementary test statistics to be <lb/>computed from orthogram values that help to diagnose both the intensity and the nature of phylogenetic <lb/>dependence.

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> In recent years, there has been considerable interest in an-<lb/>alyzing the variability of one or several life-history traits, <lb/>expressed as quantitative variables, across a set of species <lb/>sharing a common phylogeny. Such studies find their jus-<lb/>tification in the &quot; comparative method &quot; (Harvey and Pagel, <lb/>1991), which provides a renewed and enlarged vision of <lb/>an old and central paradigm of natural sciences. Compar-<lb/>ative studies have investigated the way in which two life-<lb/>history traits may correlate across a phylogenetic tree, as well <lb/>as the correlation between one trait and an environmental <lb/>variable. A serious statistical problem, affecting all these <lb/>studies, arises from the fact that species that are part of a <lb/>hierarchically structured phylogeny cannot be a priori con-<lb/>sidered as independent observations of a life-trait variable <lb/>(Felsenstein, 1985). Very often the presence of &quot; phylogenetic <lb/>signal &quot; (Blomberg, Garland, and Ives, 2003) also called &quot; phy-<lb/>logenetic autocorrelation &quot; (Gittleman and Kot, 1990) is to <lb/>be expected which means, for instance, that the difference in <lb/>trait values observed for a given pair of species is likely to <lb/>depend on their relative position in the phylogenetic tree. <lb/>The potential dependence of the values taken by the trait <lb/>in relation to the topological structure of the phylogenetic <lb/>tree, that is, &quot; phylogenetic dependence, &quot; deserves great in-<lb/>terest, not only because it may violate the main assumptions <lb/>on which current statistical tests are built, but also because a <lb/>proper characterization may provide valuable insights into the <lb/>processes and mechanisms that have shaped the data under <lb/>consideration. This has long been acknowledged (Gittleman <lb/>and Kot, 1990) in a trend analogous to the increased interest <lb/>for the study of temporal and/or spatial dependence that has <lb/>been observed in ecological sciences (Legendre, 1993). <lb/>However, concepts and methods originating from time-<lb/>series analysis and spatial statistics proved to be of a more <lb/>direct applicability to ecological data than to phyloge-<lb/>netic topics. Central to these methods are &quot; structure <lb/>functions &quot; (Legendre and Legendre, 1998), such as correlo-<lb/>gram, variogram, periodogram (Ripley, 1981; Cressie, 1991; <lb/>Wackernagel, 2003) or wavelet-based &quot; scalograms &quot; (Percival <lb/>and Walden, 2000), which are useful to describe models and <lb/>test spatial or temporal patterns. Graphic tools (e.g., more <lb/>or less sophisticated geographical maps) are also widely used <lb/>as complements of the summary provided by structure func-<lb/>tions. In contrast to this well-established, yet still burgeoning, <lb/>field developments addressing the description of phylogenetic <lb/>dependence have remained limited. Many tests dealing with <lb/>phylogenetic issues have been proposed (Blomberg, et al., <lb/>2003), several of them addressing the significance of the <lb/>correlation between a trait variable and the phylogenetic <lb/>tree. But there is no method providing a satisfactory de-<lb/>scription of how the variance of a quantitative variable is <lb/>distributed along a phylogenetic tree. In particular, the appli-<lb/>cation of nested analysis of variance (Bell, 1989) cannot com-<lb/>pletely accommodate full phylogenetic information (Blomberg <lb/>

			et al., 2003), while the only published structure function <lb/>is an extension to phylogeny of the correlogram concept <lb/>(Gittleman and Kot, 1990), which is far from having opti-<lb/>mal properties (Rohlf, 2001), just as the usual correlogram is <lb/>generally not the most relevant structure function to address <lb/>spatial or temporal dependence (Ripley, 1981). In addition, <lb/>the lack of graphical standards is blatant in the literature de-<lb/>voted to phylogeny, in which simultaneous displays of trait <lb/>values and of the reference phylogenic tree are very scarce. <lb/>The main object of this article is to provide a canonical <lb/>procedure to decompose the variance of a life-trait variable <lb/>with respect to the topological structure of a phylogenetic <lb/>tree, and to propose a new structure function, called an <lb/> &quot; orthogram, &quot; to express such a decomposition on an orthonor-<lb/>mal basis constructed from the topology of the tree. Addition-<lb/>ally, we intend to provide some complementary nonparametric <lb/>test statistics derived from the orthogram, along with princi-<lb/>ples for a simultaneous graphical display of both trait values <lb/>and phylogeny. The effectiveness of the approach will be il-<lb/>lustrated and compared with the phylogenetic correlogram, <lb/>using examples drawn from the literature and showing con-<lb/>trasted patterns of phylogenetic dependence. <lb/> 2. An Orthonormal Basis to Decompose Trait <lb/>Variance <lb/> 2.1 Building an Orthonormal Basis from the Topological <lb/>Structure <lb/> Let us consider a life-history trait represented by a quantita-<lb/>tive variable x = (x  1  , . . . , x  t  )  T  measured on t taxonomic units, <lb/>for which the topology of the phylogenetic tree is assumed to <lb/>be a priori fully determined. We will consider the following <lb/>terminology concerning the phylogenetic tree. The root is the <lb/>common ancestor to all the t contemporary taxons (OTUs: <lb/>operational taxonomic units, also called &quot; tips &quot; ) and to the <lb/> n hypothetical nodes (HTUs: hypothetical taxonomic units); <lb/>branches emanate from root and nodes, tracing the course of <lb/>evolution. Phylogenetic trees used by biologists are generally <lb/> &quot; consensus trees &quot; (Adams, 1972) or &quot; super-trees &quot; (Sanderson, <lb/>Purvis, and Henze, 1998) obtained by compiling phylogenies <lb/>established by distinct methods, which means that branch <lb/>lengths are often unknown or not accurate. <lb/>Even when data are from homogeneous origins, the esti-<lb/>mation of distances between tips from either fossil, morpho-<lb/>logical, or molecular data relies on the hypothesis that all <lb/>traits evolve at a steady rate along all branches. But evo-<lb/>lutionary rates are known to change with time (Svensson, <lb/>1997) while varying between branches of a phylogenetic tree <lb/>(Mindell and Thacker, 1996) and this often introduces a <lb/>substantial level of uncertainty around estimates of branch <lb/>lengths. Consequently, we will restrict ourselves to the most <lb/>general type of data for which only the topological structure of <lb/>the phylogenetic tree, that is, the relationships among nodes <lb/>and between nodes and tips, can be assumed to be known. <lb/>Each taxonomic unit of the tree (either tip or node) defines <lb/>a set made of its descendant tips. Thus, we can associate a <lb/>dummy variable u  k  = [u  i  ]  k <lb/> 1≤i≤t  to each taxonomic unit k (in-<lb/>cluding the root, 1 ≤ k ≤ n + t + 1), with u k <lb/>i  = 1 if the tip i is <lb/>descended from that taxonomic unit k, and u k <lb/>i  = 0 otherwise. <lb/>For example, the node N2 in Figure 1A defines a subset of tips <lb/>which is {L7, L8, L9, L10, L11, L12}, while the correspond-<lb/> Figure 1. Illustration of the orthonormal basis construction <lb/>from a fictive phylogenetic tree featuring 12 tips and 7 nodes. <lb/>(A) Representation of t − 1 dummy variables, associated to <lb/>nodes and tips, and ordered by decreasing values of np (names <lb/>of the dummy variables are labeled on the top of the table). <lb/>(B) Representation of the t − 1 orthonormal vectors of the or-<lb/>thonormal basis B. For each node of the phylogeny, the labels <lb/>indicate which vectors account for the variance associated to <lb/>each node. The size of the squares is proportional to the val-<lb/>ues of the orthonormal vectors (white and black for negative <lb/>and positive values, respectively). <lb/>ing dummy variable is u  T  = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). <lb/>For the subsequent analyses, we need to define a relative order <lb/>between dummy variables and, thus, between the correspond-<lb/>ing taxonomic units (TU). A reasonable quantitative criterion <lb/>to rank the TU is the number, np(k), of permutations between <lb/>descendants of a given node k that preserve the topological <lb/>structure of the subtree stemming from it. With such a cri-<lb/>terion, nodes are ranked according to the complexity of the <lb/>subtree they initiate. Let us now consider the table U = [u  k  ] <lb/>that contains the whole sets of the dummy variables. <lb/>All these dummy variables are obviously not linearly in-<lb/>dependent. The most obvious reason is that the dummy vari-<lb/>ables corresponding to the direct descendants of a given node, <lb/> k, sum to the dummy variable, u  k  . This problem can be easily <lb/>resolved by suppressing for each node, k, the dummy variable <lb/>corresponding to its direct descendant displaying the lowest <lb/> np value. This means eliminating n + 1 dummy variables (the <lb/>root is considered as a node) among the n + t + 1 possible, <lb/>that is, retaining only t of them. The next step is a rowwise <lb/>concatenation of these t dummy variables to form a t × t ma-<lb/>trix, V (Figure 1A). The QR decomposition (Harville, 1997) <lb/>

			of matrix V yields a t × t matrix, Q, whose columns are <lb/>the orthogonal vectors obtained by applying Gram–Schmidt <lb/>orthogonalization to the columns of V. <lb/> The orthonormal basis B associated with the phylogeny <lb/>is defined from the orthogonal basis Q. We eliminate the <lb/>first vector 1  t  corresponding to the dummy variable attached <lb/>to the root and we standardize by t  1/2  to obtain t − 1 or-<lb/>thonormal vectors (Figure 1B). Orthonormality guarantees <lb/>that  1 <lb/> t <lb/> B  T  B = I  t−1  . The vectors of B are linear combinations <lb/>of the dummy variables, and the Gram–Schmidt orthogonal-<lb/>ization guarantees that each of these vectors is ranked in ac-<lb/>cordance with the initial ranking of the dummy variables. <lb/>Consequently, the first vectors will characterize interspecific <lb/>variance among dissimilar species (two species are all the more <lb/>dissimilar that the np value of their first common ancestor is <lb/>high) and reciprocally. This enables an interpretation of the <lb/>successive vectors in terms of decreasing phylogenetic dissim-<lb/>ilarity between tips. <lb/>2.2 Decomposition and Reconstruction of the Life-Trait <lb/>Variable <lb/> From the orthonormal basis B, we can compute a vector <lb/> r = (r  1  , . . . , r  t−1  )  T  of the transform coefficients of the centered <lb/>and standardized variable x 0  , as r =  1 <lb/> t <lb/> B  T  x 0  . Centering and <lb/>standardizing are carried out using the uniform weighting of <lb/>tips. Standardization allows us to have cumulated orthogram <lb/>values between 0 and 1 thereby facilitating comparisons be-<lb/>tween examples. <lb/>Transform coefficients allow one to reconstruct the variable <lb/>using x  0  = Br, while squared-transform coefficients provide a <lb/>decomposition of its variance: 񮽙x  0  񮽙 =  1 <lb/> t <lb/> x  T <lb/> 0 x 0  =  1 <lb/> t <lb/> r  T  B  T  Br = <lb/> r  T  r. Squared coefficients, that is, (r  2 <lb/> i  )  1≤i≤t−1  , as well as cumu-<lb/>lative squared coefficients, can be plotted against i ∈ {1, . . . , <lb/> t − 1} yielding two graphical tools, that we will call or-<lb/>thogram and cumulative orthogram, respectively. The sign of <lb/>coefficients can also be mentioned for orthogram values (see <lb/>Figures 2–4). Both types of orthograms provide a means to <lb/>display the variance decomposition for the trait while enabling <lb/>several tests for phylogenetic dependence. As we will see in <lb/>the examples, the ordering of orthonormal vectors by decreas-<lb/>ing np values of the corresponding dummy variables enhances <lb/>the interpretability of orthogram results. <lb/> 3. Testing for Phylogenetic Dependence <lb/> We consider as null hypothesis (H  0  ) the complete absence of <lb/>phylogenetic dependence (Bloomberg et al., 2003) and, thus, <lb/>that the t observed tip values are exchangeable irrespective <lb/>of the topological structure of the tree. This means that the <lb/>observed decomposition of the trait variance is to be com-<lb/>pared with decompositions obtained from a sample of the t! <lb/> permutations defined on the elements of x = [x  i  ]  1≤i≤t  , and <lb/>for which the orthogram is expected to have uniform values. <lb/>To carry out such a comparison, we introduced four statistics <lb/>computed from the variance decomposition on which tests <lb/>of the null hypothesis are based. The four tests are comple-<lb/>mentary in the sense that they may have different relevance <lb/>and power in the presence of distinct alternatives to H  0  (see <lb/>below). <lb/>A first test is built on the statistic, <lb/>R2Max (x) = max <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> r  2 <lb/>1  , . . . , r  2 <lb/> t−1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> , <lb/> Figure 2.

			which is expected to peak when a unique vector of the basis <lb/>accounts for a large share of the trait variance. This would <lb/>mean that a significant change in the life trait appeared at <lb/>one node of the phylogenetic tree while being conserved in the <lb/>deriving branches. This test is likely to be of limited relevance <lb/>in the presence of a diffuse dependence, that is, when several <lb/>nodes are prominent to explain the trait variance and when <lb/>the orthogram is, therefore dominated by several large values <lb/>instead of a unique sharp peak. In an analogy with what has <lb/>been proposed to test smooth periodograms (Bartlett, 1954), <lb/>we derived a second statistic from the cumulative orthogram, <lb/>namely, <lb/> D max (x) = max <lb/> 1≤m≤t−1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> m <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> i=1 <lb/> r  2 <lb/> i  − <lb/> m <lb/>t − 1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> . <lb/> It corresponds exactly to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statis-<lb/>tic used to test whether the vector [ <lb/> 񮽙  m <lb/>i=1 <lb/> r  2 <lb/> i  ]  1≤m≤t−1  may be <lb/>an ordered random sample from the uniform distribution on <lb/>(0, 1). The third test is built on the statistic, <lb/>SkR2k (x) = <lb/> t−1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> i=1 <lb/> ir  2 <lb/> i  , <lb/> which assesses to what extent the variance distribution across <lb/>the phylogenetic tree is rather skewed to the root or to the <lb/>tips. The last test corresponds to the statistic, <lb/>SCE (x) = <lb/> t−1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> i=1 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> r  2 <lb/> i  − r  2 <lb/> i−1 <lb/> 񮽙  2  , <lb/> which measures the average local variation of the orthogram <lb/>values. <lb/>For all four statistics, confidence envelopes are built from <lb/>a relevant number of Monte Carlo randomizations of the x i <lb/> values. All computations and graphical displays involved in <lb/>the preparation of this article were carried out using R (Ihaka <lb/>and Gentleman, 1996), with both pre-programmed and per-<lb/>sonal routines. These routines will be incorporated in the ade4 <lb/>package available at http://cran.r-project.org/, and in <lb/>the meantime are available by a simple request to the first <lb/>author. The computer code is available at the Biometrics web-<lb/>site http://www.tibs.org. <lb/> 4. Applications <lb/> Phylogenetic examples came from several papers that stud-<lb/>ied the degree to which phylogenetic history has shaped the <lb/>evolution of phenotypic characters or life traits. We retained <lb/>three examples that typify contrasted levels and aspects of <lb/>phylogenetic dependence. For each example we compared the <lb/>results provided by the orthogram with the results yielded by <lb/>the only other proposed structure function, namely the phy-<lb/>logenetic correlogram (Gittleman and Kot, 1990). The cor-<lb/>relogram corresponding to each example is constructed by <lb/>computing Moran&apos;s I coefficients (Cliff and Ord, 1981), for <lb/>successive classes of phylogenetic distance (Figure 5). Detailed <lb/>procedures for computing correlogram values and their corre-<lb/>sponding confidence intervals are provided by Gittleman and <lb/>Kot (1990). <lb/>Exploratory analyses of life-trait evolution should start <lb/>with meaningful displays of the variation of the focal trait <lb/> Figure 5. Phylogenetic correlograms with respectively six, <lb/>five, and seven successive Moran&apos;s I coefficients (solid <lb/>squares). The straight line indicates the expected value under <lb/>H  0  and dashed lines the bilateral confidence interval at 5%, <lb/>deduced from 999 Monte Carlo permutations. <lb/>along the phylogenetic tree, just as most quantitative studies <lb/>of spatially structured phenomena usually start with a visual <lb/>analysis using geographical maps of the variables under study. <lb/>But such displays are still greatly lacking in phylogenetic lit-<lb/>erature and we have, therefore, proposed a simple graphical <lb/>method. We represent the tree in front of the dotplot of the <lb/>variable (Figure 2A). This graphical representation takes a <lb/>leaf out of Cleveland&apos;s book (1994) for it was he who defined <lb/>the dotplot &quot; as a graphical method for measurements that <lb/>have labels. &quot; As for geographical maps in the spatial domain, <lb/>this graphical representation will help to give a first idea about <lb/>the nature of the patterns, while enhancing the interpretation <lb/>of quantitative results. <lb/>1. Absence of phylogenetic dependence <lb/>We first analyzed data provided by Bried, Pontier, and <lb/>Jouventin (2002), about the adult life expectancy of 18 species <lb/>of procellariiformes (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic relationships <lb/>were compiled from various information sources available <lb/>for Procellariiformes (see Bried et al., 2002 for details). <lb/>

The trait variable of life expectancy <lb/>has been square root transformed prior to analysis so as to <lb/>make its distribution more symmetric and normal. None of <lb/>our four tests rejected the null hypothesis of a uniform dis-<lb/>tribution of orthogram values, because the observed values of <lb/>the four corresponding statistics were all exceeded by results <lb/>of many Monte Carlo randomizations (Table 1). Furthermore, <lb/>values of the cumulated orthogram remained within the con-<lb/>fidence envelopes (Figure 2B). All these results pointed to an <lb/>absence of phylogenetic dependence for that life-history trait. <lb/>The phylogenetic correlogram of observed data (Figure 5) also <lb/>indicated an absence of phylogenetic dependence whatever the <lb/>distance class. Thus, this example supports the idea that not <lb/>all traits are correlated to their phylogenetic history. Indeed, <lb/>there exist specific evolutionary scenarios (Blomberg et al., <lb/>2003) under which correlation between a trait and its phylo-<lb/>genetic history is likely to be low. Although testing for the <lb/>absence of phylogenetic dependence could appear trivial, it is <lb/>a first and unavoidable step to study the relationship between <lb/>a life trait and a phylogeny, as shown by this example. <lb/>2. Importance of a particular node <lb/>For this example, we analyzed a data set from Pélabon et al. <lb/>(1995) relating to the adult female body weight of 18 species <lb/>of Ungulates, using their tip data and the joint phylogeny <lb/>(Figure 3A). Because the phylogenetic relationships are un-<lb/>known for ungulates (Gaillard, personal communication), a <lb/>taxonomy-based phylogeny with unknown branch lengths has <lb/>been used. The trait has been log-transformed prior to anal-<lb/>ysis. Only the test based on R2Max was significant (Table <lb/>1). Moreover, the plot of orthogram values highlighted the <lb/>prevalence of the fourth vector of the basis, which corre-<lb/>sponds to the node highlighted by an arrow on the Figure 3B. <lb/>The simultaneous representation of that score and trait values <lb/>(Figure 3A) clearly confirmed the presence of an important <lb/>evolutionary event that appeared at node w10 and conserved <lb/>until present. Such an evolutionary pattern generates a kind <lb/>of phylogenetic dependence that appeared hard to detect by <lb/>three of the test statistics (SkR2k, DMax, and SCE), by the <lb/>cumulative orthogram, and also by the phylogenetic correlo-<lb/>gram (Figure 5). Only the multiple tests on individual values <lb/>of the orthogram and the test statistic R2Max proved able to <lb/>indicate a significant departure from phylogenetic indepen-<lb/>dence. <lb/>3. Diffuse phylogenetic dependence <lb/>The last example analyzed deals with the age at matu-<lb/>rity (years) of 49 species of teleost fishes (Figure 4A). Data <lb/>have been provided by Rochet et al. (2000) who compiled <lb/>the most recent information available for teleost fishes to es-<lb/>tablish phylogenetic relationships. Partial phylogenetic trees <lb/>based on morpho-anatomical characters and on molecular <lb/>traits were collated to yield a consensus tree summarizing <lb/>present knowledge about teleost interrelationships. As data <lb/>were obtained from different sources and methods, estimates <lb/>of branch lengths are not available or comparable. The life <lb/>trait was log-transformed prior to the analysis. This trait can <lb/>be considered as shaped by phylogenetic history because three <lb/>test statistics (SkR2k, DMax, and SCE) revealed a significant <lb/>departure from H  0  (Table 1) while the cumulative orthogram <lb/>had most of its values outside the confidence envelopes <lb/>(Figures 4B). This pattern of phylogenetic dependence is rad-<lb/>ically different from the preceding pattern. In this example, <lb/>the values of the orthogram and, thus, the portions of inter-<lb/>specific variance, decreased regularly as a function of the com-<lb/>plexity value, np, of the nodes. The phylogenetic correlogram <lb/>(Figure 5) confirmed the existence of a &quot; phylogenetic gradi-<lb/>ent &quot; : there was a monotonic decrease of coefficients in relation <lb/>to phylogenetic distance. This profile indicated that closely re-<lb/>lated species tend to have similar trait values and that such <lb/>a similarity decreases with phylogenetic distance. <lb/> 5. Discussion <lb/> The above examples demonstrate that orthonormal transform <lb/>is a relevant approach to diagnose different degrees and types <lb/>of phylogenetic dependence in both small and large phyloge-<lb/>nies, as well as with different types of phenotypic characters. <lb/>The approach is all the more relevant in that modern com-<lb/>puter technology with its high-power graphic screens display-<lb/>ing multiple, linkable windows allows one to consider dynamic <lb/>simultaneous views on the phylogenetic data and on the dis-<lb/>tributions of the values taken by the structure functions and <lb/>test statistics. <lb/>Characterizing phylogenetic dependence using an orthonor-<lb/>mal transform comprises two main steps, namely (i) the def-<lb/>inition of an orthonormal basis B, which ensures a canonical <lb/>description of the tree topology and (ii) the variance decom-<lb/>position on the basis that yields the structure functions called <lb/>orthograms. Such a strategy is generic in the sense that it <lb/>does not necessitate any assumption on the structure of the <lb/>tree and therefore contrasts with several ad hoc methods that <lb/>have been previously proposed. Furthermore, the principle of <lb/>orthonormal transforms obviously surpasses the study of phy-<lb/>logenetic data. Indeed, in the spatial and/or temporal domain, <lb/>the Fourier transform as well as several kinds of wavelet trans-<lb/>forms (Percival, 2002) also rely on specific orthonormal bases <lb/>(Percival and Walden, 2000). Furthermore, all the canonical <lb/>bases associated with linear and bidimensional supports such <lb/>as the eigenvectors of a graph matrix (Cvetkoviv, Doob, and <lb/>Sachs, 1979) could be used to calculate spatial and temporal <lb/>orthograms. Thus, the eigenvectors of a matrix of inter-tips <lb/>phylogenetic distances (sensu Rohlf, 2001) can provide an al-<lb/>ternative way to compute a phylogenetic orthogram. <lb/>Consequently, the four tests statistics we have used can <lb/>also be applied to structure functions that are analogues of <lb/>the orthogram. Statistics R2Max and Dmax have long been <lb/>

			proposed for the Fourier periodogram (Bartlett, 1954; Diggle, <lb/>1990), but they are obviously relevant in regards to wavelet <lb/>decompositions using an orthonormal basis. This is also true <lb/>with respect to the third and the fourth statistics whose use in <lb/>relation to structure functions is new to our knowledge. There <lb/>are, indeed, many extensions of this work, which should be <lb/>examined in the future. As with so many tests aimed at pat-<lb/>tern detection, no information on power is yet available. The <lb/>three examples we did provide as illustrations cannot claim to <lb/>encompass all the diversity of phylogenetic patterns, though <lb/>they clearly illustrate that the different statistics and struc-<lb/>ture functions are likely to be of varying pertinence and power <lb/>when facing contrasted alternatives to phylogenetic indepen-<lb/>dence (see in Figures 3 and 5 the limited power of both phy-<lb/>logenetic correlogram and cumulative orthogram with respect <lb/>to the second example). The orthogram provides a very rich <lb/>account of variance decomposition because there are as many <lb/>values as tips (minus 1) in the tree, while the correlogram <lb/>only gives averaged results for a limited number of classes <lb/>of phylogenetic distances. This is analogous to the limitation <lb/>encountered in the temporal/spatial domain with the correl-<lb/>ogram (or the closely related Moran&apos;s Index, Cliff and Ord, <lb/>1981), when compared with a wavelet decomposition that can <lb/>also provide results for individual observations. <lb/>In the future, the different properties of structure func-<lb/>tions and test statistics could be useful to identify which kind <lb/>of phylogenetic dependence is present (e.g., diffuse vs. struc-<lb/>tured by particular nodes) by considering which particular <lb/>tests reject the null hypothesis and those which do not. How-<lb/>ever, in order to do so on a properly established basis it is still <lb/>necessary to study and assess the power of these tests with <lb/>regards to phylogenetic data, simulated under various models <lb/>of evolutionary change, and having contrasted characteristics <lb/>in terms of branch lengths and divergence time. Moreover, the <lb/>ultimate goal of most comparative studies being the analysis <lb/>of the evolutionary patterns of several life traits (Felsenstein, <lb/>1985), a multivariate extension of our orthonormal basis ap-<lb/>proach is, obviously, the next step to consider in the near <lb/>future. <lb/>
