Self-perception of knowledge and <lb/>intelligence represent one factor that may impact willingness to learn about climate change. <lb/>We explored this possibility with a case study in Raleigh, North Carolina in 2015 (n = 200). <lb/>Our goal was to test how gender and ethnicity influenced perceptions people had of their <lb/>own climate change knowledge. Survey respondents were asked how strongly they agreed <lb/>with the statement &quot;I feel knowledgeable about climate change&quot; (1 = strongly disagree, and <lb/>5 = strongly agree). Our survey instrument also included demographic questions about <lb/>race, age, income, gender, and education, as well as respondent&apos;s experience with natural <lb/>disasters and drought. We observed an interaction between education and gender where <lb/>women&apos;s self-perceived knowledge was higher than men among people with low levels of <lb/>educational attainment, but was higher for men than women among people with high levels <lb/>of educational attainment. In addition, minority respondents self-reported lower perceived <lb/>climate change knowledge than white respondents, regardless of educational attainment. <lb/>This study enhances our understanding of the gender gap in self-perceptions of climate <lb/>knowledge by suggesting it is contingent on educational attainment. This could be the result <lb/>of stereotype-threat experienced by women and minorities, and exacerbated by educational <lb/>systems. Because people who question their knowledge are often more able to learn, partic-<lb/>ularly in ideologically charged contexts, highly educated women and minorities may be <lb/>more successful learning about climate change than white men. <lb/>PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210149 January 4, 2019 <lb/>1 / 10 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>OPEN ACCESS <lb/>Citation: Selm KR, Peterson MN, Hess GR, Beck <lb/>SM, McHale MR (2019) Educational attainment <lb/>predicts negative perceptions women have of their <lb/>own climate change knowledge.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Educational efforts are often promoted as antidotes to apathy and denial associated with envi-<lb/>ronmental issues. Increased environmental knowledge often predicts concerns over the social <lb/>and environmental impacts of climate change [1], [2], which in turn promotes individual and <lb/>collective action [3-5]. Despite the effectiveness of education as a tool to promote environ-<lb/>mental action, achieving and fostering climate literacy can also be challenging as educational <lb/>efforts are confounded by successful media campaigns to foster skepticism among the public <lb/>[6], [7]. <lb/>Climate change literacy can serve to further polarize certain individuals [8-10]. Kahan et al. <lb/>(2012) found that scientific literacy and numeracy has opposite effects on climate change con-<lb/>cern among those with differing worldviews [11]. They found that those who subscribe to a <lb/>worldview that ties authority to conspicuous social rankings become less concerned about the <lb/>risks of climate change with increasing scientific literacy and numeracy. Those with world-<lb/>views that favor less regimented forms of social organization and greater collective attention to <lb/>the individual respond to climate change education with increasing concern. This gap is attrib-<lb/>uted to identity-protective cognition, wherein the holders of certain worldviews use and credit <lb/>the information that is supportive of their own values and opinions [8], [11-13]. Adolescents, <lb/>however, appear more capable of transcending their personal ideology to learn about climate <lb/>change than adults [14], [15]. <lb/>Self-perceptions of knowledge represent a less studied factor that may also shape efficacy of <lb/>climate change education efforts. Perceptions of intelligence can determine how people engage <lb/>with issues; for example, illusions of superiority can distort the way people filter and take-in <lb/>information [16], [17]. Studies find that if people feel confident in their levels of knowledge, <lb/>regardless of their assessed knowledge, they are unlikely to be motivated to acquire new infor-<lb/>mation [18-20]; feelings of academic inferiority, on the other hand, can drive the search for <lb/>further knowledge [18], [20], [21]. Alternatively, negative self-perceptions can have detrimen-<lb/>tal impacts; studies find low confidence is one contributing factor to the high attrition rates of <lb/>women and minorities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields [22], [23]. <lb/>Negative cultural stereotypes can lead to these biased self-perceptions by inducing fear and <lb/>anxiety-known as stereotype threat [24]. Stereotype threat undermines academic perfor-<lb/>mance and can reduce one&apos;s sense of agency [23], [25]. Negative stereotypes exist in particular <lb/>for women and minority groups. Both men and women perceive women to be less knowledge-<lb/>able on the topics of politics [26] and science [27], and studies find individuals with lighter <lb/>skin are perceived to be more intelligent, regardless of their assessed intelligence [28]. <lb/>Few studies have explored the knowledge perceptions of women and minorities as it relates <lb/>to climate change science. This is a critical gap within the climate change perceptions literature <lb/>for several reasons. First, although women appear to be more ideologically receptive to climate <lb/>change education than men [7], [29], they may possess self-perceived limitations, intensified <lb/>by educational attainment [30]-[32], that could influence the way they engage with this <lb/>increasingly important topic [33], [34]. In addition, the demographics of America are shifting; <lb/>the US Census Bureau (2012a) predicts the US will be a majority-minority country as early as <lb/>2043 [35]. This means that non-whites will be increasingly exposed to, and required to respond <lb/>to, the impacts of climate change in America. Ensuring that these groups feel empowered to <lb/>take on such a challenge is therefore important. <lb/>Our goal was to evaluate the self-perceptions of knowledge on climate change among vari-<lb/>ous socio-demographic groups, particularly women and minorities. We tested whether the fol-<lb/>lowing: age, education, gender, experience with disaster and drought, race, and an interaction <lb/>between gender and education, predicted the respondent&apos;s self-perceived level of climate <lb/></body>

			<body>change knowledge. Because women may underestimate their comprehension of climate sci-<lb/>ence [32], we anticipated that women would perceive a lower level of climate change knowl-<lb/>edge than their male counterparts. We also expected that increasing educational attainment <lb/>would further reduce the level of knowledge perceived by women, since increasing education <lb/>may reduce confidence in knowledge among women [30], [31]. Similarly, we hypothesized <lb/>that minority respondents would self-report less knowledge on climate change than white <lb/>respondents because previous research suggests racial minorities experience negative self-per-<lb/>ceptions of intelligence [23]. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study site <lb/>We conducted our surveys in Raleigh, NC, which is a city comprised of a diverse and educated <lb/>community, built around professional and technical services (Location Quotient = 1.78) and <lb/>education services (Location Quotient = 0.98) [36], [37]. The percentage of the population <lb/>with a bachelor&apos;s degree or higher in Raleigh (49.2%), is greater than the average for the state <lb/>of North Carolina (29%) [38]. Raleigh&apos;s population (pop. 464,758) is also relatively diverse <lb/>compared to the state as a whole; 40.4% of the population in Raleigh is a minority race or eth-<lb/>nicity, compared to 29.2% statewide [38]. Thus findings from this study are most relevant to <lb/>other urban areas with an emerging economy and culture linked to technology, professional <lb/>services, and educational services. <lb/>Survey instrument <lb/>We measured respondent&apos;s self-perceived knowledge of climate change on a 5-point scale with <lb/>the statement &quot;I feel knowledgeable about climate change.&quot; Our survey instrument also <lb/>included demographic questions about race, age, income, gender, and education, as well as <lb/>respondent&apos;s experience with natural disasters and drought. We measured education on an <lb/>11-point scale, ranging from no formal education completed (1) to a doctorate degree (11). <lb/>Income was measured in $20,000 increments, ranging from less than $10,000 a year (below <lb/>poverty) to more than $210,000 a year. The design of the survey instrument was guided by <lb/>Dillman&apos;s tailored design method [39]. The final instrument was developed with pretesting <lb/>among an equal number of respondents across five social vulnerability classes (n = 20). <lb/>Respondents were asked at the end of the survey to give feedback on the instrument. After <lb/>evaluating this feedback, cognitive interviews were conducted with 5 participants to identify <lb/>any alternative interpretations of survey questions. All research was reviewed and approved by <lb/>the NC State University Institutional Review Board for the Use of Human Subjects in Research <lb/>(Protocol Number 4087) and respondents before each survey provided written informed <lb/>consent. <lb/>Sampling <lb/>We administered two hundred surveys door-to-door in Raleigh, NC, during the summer of <lb/>2015. To promote a representative sample of demographic groups, the sample locations were <lb/>evenly stratified across five social vulnerability classes, ranging from high to low vulnerability, <lb/>found in Cutter et al.&apos;s 2006-10 [40] social vulnerability index (SoVI) data set. The 2006-10 <lb/>SoVI data set is a national index of social vulnerability, comprising 27 sociological characteris-<lb/>tics that are aggregated into quintiles. Eight significant components, including race and gen-<lb/>der, explained 78% of the variance in the SoVI data set [40]. Within the boundary of Raleigh&apos;s <lb/>city limits, we randomly selected forty households from each of the five SoVI levels using <lb/></body>

			<body>Hawth&apos;s tools in ArcMap 10.x GIS software [41]. We started sampling from those houses <lb/>selected with the GIS analysis and, if no one answered, we visited every other house within the <lb/>SoVI boundaries until a participant agreed to be surveyed. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>We constructed a full ordinary least squares regression model in SAS version 9.4 software for <lb/>Windows [42], for the dependent variable, &quot;I feel knowledgeable about climate change.&quot; We <lb/>controlled for the following predictor variables: age, race, education, gender, past experience <lb/>with any natural disasters and drought, and included an interaction term between education <lb/>and gender. We collapsed the seven race categories into white and minority due to low <lb/>response rates in several categories. Income was not included in the full model as it was collin-<lb/>ear with educational attainment (r = 0.45). <lb/>Results <lb/>Overall, self-perception of climate knowledge was higher among women than men, countering <lb/>our initial hypothesis (Table 1). However, education interacted with gender: highly educated <lb/>women had a lower self-perception of climate change knowledge than less educated women, <lb/>whereas highly educated men had a higher self-perception of climate change knowledge than <lb/>less educated men (Table 1; Fig 1). Increasing educational attainment reversed the gap between <lb/>the genders because self-perceived knowledge levels among women declined as their educa-<lb/>tional attainment increased. With all other variables held constant, women were around one <lb/>point higher than men on the self-reported climate change knowledge scale at the lowest level <lb/>of educational attainment, and around 0.6 points lower than men at the highest level of educa-<lb/>tional attainment. Minority respondents also perceived lower levels of knowledge about cli-<lb/>mate change than white respondents (p = 0.02). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our results contribute to literature on self-perceived climate knowledge by suggesting gender <lb/>differences may be contingent on educational attainment. Women have been shown to under-<lb/>estimate their competence and intelligence in many fields, including climate change [32], [33], <lb/>a phenomenon commonly referred to as the &quot;gender confidence gap&quot; [43], [44].

			<body>confidence gap is often attributed to the high standards of perfection to which women hold <lb/>themselves [45], [46], as well as their risk-aversion [47], [48]. However, our results suggest this <lb/>gap exists primarily among those with higher education and is perhaps reversed between the <lb/>genders among those with low education. <lb/>Multiple explanations for this interaction are possible. Negative stereotypes face women <lb/>regarding their academic proficiency, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math <lb/>(STEM) fields [24], [49]. These negative stereotypes can elicit a disruptive and anxious state, <lb/>known as stereotype-threat [24], [50], [51], which can undermine academic performance and <lb/>contribute to the high attrition rates of women in STEM fields [22], [23]. These stereotypes <lb/>can also influence the way women and young girls are treated in classrooms; some teachers are <lb/>biased against women, particularly in math and the sciences [52], [53], a phenomenon com-<lb/>monly referred to as expectation bias [54], [55]. These biases can further exacerbate the nega-<lb/>tive self-perceptions of female students [56], [57], and become self-fulfilling prophecies, as <lb/>these students are often sent on less ambitious tracks [58]. <lb/>The negative self-perceptions of knowledge held by educated women may actually be an <lb/>indication of intelligence. Kruger and Dunning [21] illustrated that the highest performing <lb/>individuals underestimate their abilities, while those who over estimate, but are incompetent, <lb/>do not recognize their incompetence because they lack metacognition. The &quot;Dunning-Kruger&quot; <lb/>effect, as it is known, is supported by the climate change literature, where women exhibit more <lb/>scientifically accurate climate change knowledge than do men, yet underestimate their climate <lb/>change knowledge more than men [32], [33]. To better explain the differences in perceived <lb/>knowledge between the genders observed in this and other studies, future studies should assess <lb/>the actual and perceived levels of knowledge of climate change science between males and <lb/>females throughout their educational careers. <lb/>Fig 1. Effect of education on self-perceived climate change knowledge among women and men. Both regression lines predicting climate change knowledge <lb/>were generated from the regression equation used to generate results in Table 1-where demographic variables, as well as drought and disaster experience <lb/>predict climate change knowledge. Error bars represent standard error. Y-axis starts at 3 as no respondents self-reported knowledge levels below 3. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210149.g001 <lb/></body>

			<body>One crucial implication of the &quot;Dunning-Kruger effect&quot; is that a low level of confidence in <lb/>one&apos;s own knowledge may actually be a driving force in the search for further information <lb/>[18], [20]. Highly educated women may therefore be well suited to learning about the complex <lb/>and controversial topic of climate change. Climate change can be an intrinsically challenging <lb/>phenomenon to understand [9] because political ideology promotes selective use of informa-<lb/>tion [59] and the causes are not directly observable [60], [61]. The critical thinking skills pro-<lb/>vided by higher education [62], a healthy skepticism of ones own assumptions, and a drive to <lb/>seek further knowledge-qualities that highly educated women likely possess, may aid in pro-<lb/>moting a better understanding of climate science. <lb/>Cultural exclusion, expectation bias, and limited representation of minorities in STEM <lb/>majors [63] likely all contributed to the low level of self-reported climate change knowledge <lb/>among minority respondents. Minority groups are often culturally excluded from rigorous sci-<lb/>entific and environmental education [64] and many attend schools in low-income urban <lb/>school districts, which are largely under-funded [65]. Additionally, minority respondents may <lb/>have self-reported lower levels of knowledge due to cultural stereotypes of intellectual ability, <lb/>similar to those that plague women. For example, Steele and Aronson [24] found that black <lb/>students only underperform compared to white students when they believe their intellectual <lb/>ability is being tested. The biased expectations that teachers have of minority students can <lb/>influence their pedagogical effectiveness, further driving the academic underperformance of <lb/>minorities [66]. Future studies should explore the drivers of low perceived climate change <lb/>knowledge among minorities and compare the levels of assessed climate change knowledge of <lb/>minority groups to their levels of perceived knowledge. <lb/>Increasing climate change knowledge and self-perceptions of intelligence of minority <lb/>groups is critical since we are projected to be a majority-minority country by 2043 [35]. The <lb/>lack of psycho-social support coupled with lower perceptions of knowledge could have nega-<lb/>tive implications for the engagement of racial minorities and women in climate change advo-<lb/>cacy and education. More culturally diverse communicators on the topic of climate science <lb/>could help encourage engagement [11], [67] as well as better k-12 environmental education <lb/>programs in majority-minority schools. Studies have also found that one way to successfully <lb/>fortify students against these ill effects is with social-psychological interventions, such as with <lb/>praise to enforce an incremental theory of intelligence [68] or through self-affirming writing <lb/>assignments that aim to reduce negative stereotypes [69], [70]. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This study enhances our understanding of the gender gap previously identified in the climate <lb/>change knowledge perceptions literature [32], [33]. Our results illustrate that the negative per-<lb/>ceptions of climate change knowledge in women are correlated with higher educational attain-<lb/>ment, and at lower levels of education, women actually self-report more knowledge than men. <lb/>Although further research is required, previous studies find minorities have lower levels of <lb/>assessed climate change knowledge [32], and a lack of psycho-social support-which can lead <lb/>to less engagement with scientific topics [67], [71]. Together with our findings, these studies <lb/>may indicate the need for educational and psychological intervention on behalf of minorities <lb/>in order to increase climate change literacy and perceptions of intelligence. A lack of confi-<lb/>dence in one&apos;s own knowledge can make educational efforts more effective by encouraging <lb/>further knowledge seeking [18], but a downside may emerge if highly educated women and <lb/>minorities avoid starting conversations with others about climate change because they do not <lb/>believe they understand the issue well enough. Encouraging knowledge-seeking behavior <lb/>among women and minorities-who are less skeptical about climate change than white men <lb/></body>
