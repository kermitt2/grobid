A statistical method is presented that analyzes reported earthquake fatalities as a function <lb/>of a heterogeneous set of parameters selected on the basis of their presumed influence on earthquake mortality. <lb/>The ensemble was compiled from demographic, seismic, and reported fatality data culled from available records of <lb/>past earthquakes organized in a geographic information system. The authors consider the statistical relation <lb/>between earthquake mortality and the available data ensemble, analyze the validity of the results in view of the <lb/>parametric uncertainties, and propose a multivariate mortality analysis prediction method. The analysis reveals <lb/>that, although the highest mortality rates are expected in poorly developed rural areas, high fatality counts can <lb/>result from a wide range of mortality ratios that depend on the effective population size. <lb/>demography; mortality; multivariate analysis; natural disasters <lb/>Abbreviations: GDP, gross domestic product; USGS, US Geological Survey. <lb/></front>

			<body>The scientific issue we address in this paper is that of <lb/>analyzing which physical and demographic factors most <lb/>affect earthquake mortality. This analysis responds to the <lb/>need of organizations involved in humanitarian aid in de-<lb/>veloping countries to intervene promptly when confronted <lb/>with the problem of preparing emergency relief and disaster <lb/>mitigation programs for natural disasters. This need moti-<lb/>vates development of models capable of estimating potential <lb/>human losses from natural disasters that may occur any-<lb/>where on the globe, which significantly constrains the qual-<lb/>ity of methods used to estimate mortality. Thus, in contrast <lb/>to the developed world, where the most pertinent demo-<lb/>graphic and physical parameters are readily accessible and <lb/>are of high quality, in developing countries, certain data are <lb/>scarce, unreliable, or nonexistent. <lb/>New data retrieval and satellite remote sensing technolo-<lb/>gies are opening new avenues that may overcome the defi-<lb/>ciencies mentioned above. Recently, with the development <lb/>of geographic information systems, earthquake engineers, <lb/>seismologists, and emergency relief agencies have collabo-<lb/>rated to develop information technology systems to help <lb/>decision makers rapidly assess potential damage and mor-<lb/>tality in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake (1-7). <lb/>Such models have been calibrated by using detailed classi-<lb/>fication of buildings, soil types, and other key components <lb/>from past, well-documented earthquakes. Although these <lb/>models are continuously improving, the sophistication re-<lb/>quired, in terms of both the quality of input data and mod-<lb/>eling resources, limits implementation of these techniques <lb/>to developing countries. This limitation is primarily the re-<lb/>sult of the incompleteness of pertinent parametric data in <lb/>some of the affected areas. <lb/>In this paper, we start by first identifying fatal earthquakes <lb/>(those that resulted in deaths) and their location (events); we <lb/>then report on other relevant physical and environmental <lb/>information concerning each event, such as the magnitude <lb/></body>

			<body>of the earthquake according to the Richter scale and where <lb/>on the earth&apos;s crust the earthquake took place. The second <lb/>and more challenging phase is to compute the affected pop-<lb/>ulation and how it is distributed with respect to where the <lb/>earthquake took place. Hence, from an epidemiologic point <lb/>of view, earthquakes can be seen as a disease whose mor-<lb/>tality can be linked to a number of contributing factors. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Data retrieval and compilation <lb/>We compiled a data ensemble so that each of the selected <lb/>parameters meets the following two requirements: 1) it can <lb/>be geographically referenced to a sufficiently precise posi-<lb/>tion on the globe, and 2) it has been deemed by the engi-<lb/>neering and scientific community to have some potential <lb/>bearing on earthquake mortality. <lb/>Each event is tagged to the relevant, quantifiable factors <lb/>that may have a bearing on mortality. The worldwide earth-<lb/>quake casualty set was compiled from fatality and injury <lb/>reports in the US Geological Survey (USGS) (8) database <lb/>of significant earthquakes (those that either exceeded a mag-<lb/>nitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale or caused fatalities, in-<lb/>juries, or substantial damage) dating back to 1980. The <lb/>database also contains other attendant seismologic factors <lb/>pertaining to the location and depth of the earthquake, dis-<lb/>cussed in more detail below. <lb/>We divided the data set into two classes. The first includes <lb/>statistically derived demographic data. The second includes <lb/>parameters that are physical or pertain to physically related <lb/>environmental factors; here, we incorporate reported fatali-<lb/>ties and injuries resulting from the earthquake. <lb/>Demarcation of the affected area <lb/>It is evident that the earthquake mortality analysis pre-<lb/>sented herein is inherently dependent on identification and <lb/>demarcation of the affected area, for it establishes not only <lb/>the boundaries of the affected population but also the values <lb/>of the other-physical and environmental-parameters to <lb/>which the population was exposed during the earthquake. <lb/>The toponomy types provided in the USGS data set are not <lb/>homogeneous. Sometimes, the name of an affected town or <lb/>city is given; in other instances, only the district or county is <lb/>provided. To homogenize the definition of the affected area <lb/>(and hence its population data sets), we demarcated the <lb/>affected areas with circles, as described in the following <lb/>three paragraphs. <lb/>Locate the affected area. We used a geographic infor-<lb/>mation system to locate a town or administrative unit pro-<lb/>vided by USGS. If the toponomy given by the USGS <lb/>database could not be located, no circle was digitized and <lb/>the event was discarded. <lb/>Demarcate the affected area with circles. For a city, we <lb/>ensured that most of the high-density areas were contained <lb/>in the circle. We decided that suburban regions should be <lb/>included unless they had a radial orientation, which would <lb/>imply inclusion of a large portion of a rural area. The fol-<lb/>lowing information pertains to an administrative unit: 1) in <lb/>a sparsely populated unit, we drew the circle in such a way <lb/>that it covered most of the administrative unit and coincided <lb/>as much as possible with its borders; 2) in a unit with pop-<lb/>ulation centers (towns or cities with higher population den-<lb/>sities), we drew the circle so that it contained the major <lb/>population centers. <lb/>Assign attributes. For each circle, we assigned an iden-<lb/>tification tag along with specific demographic, physical, and <lb/>environmental attributes. These attributes were compiled by <lb/>mapping the circle to the other information layers contained <lb/>in the geographic information system database (discussed in <lb/>the sections below). <lb/>We provide a representative example from the El Quindío <lb/>earthquake of January 25, 1999, in Colombia. For this earth-<lb/>quake, the USGS database reports 1,185 persons killed and <lb/>more than 700 missing and presumed killed. In the city of <lb/>Armenia, 907 fatalities are reported, with 60 percent of the <lb/>buildings destroyed. However, whereas similar percentages <lb/>of structural damage were reported in the neighboring towns <lb/>of Calarcá and Pereira, no fatality figures are given for ei-<lb/>ther. It is highly unlikely that such structural damage did not <lb/>result in a high number of fatalities even though no fatalities <lb/>are explicitly ascribed. In the case of the El Quindío earth-<lb/>quake, the affected area is taken as the large circle encom-<lb/>passing the urban centers mentioned in the USGS report, <lb/>as shown in Web figure 1. (This figure is posted on the <lb/>Journal&apos;s website (http://aje.oupjournals.org/).) <lb/>Reported casualties: fatalities and injuries <lb/>After examining the USGS database, we compiled a total <lb/>of 366 earthquake events (those in which at least one fatality <lb/>FIGURE 1.

Although the sources from which the USGS draws <lb/>its casualty reports are not provided, such figures are usually <lb/>obtained from local governmental authorities as well as in-<lb/>ternational nongovernmental aid agencies. Whereas casualty <lb/>reporting in the developed world is means-supported by gov-<lb/>ernmental and financial institutions for legal and financial <lb/>claims reasons, it is expected that casualty reporting in the <lb/>developing world is inaccurate. In these countries, the lack of <lb/>a strong governmental social infrastructure where, quite of-<lb/>ten, population censuses are lacking and emergency relief <lb/>mechanisms cannot always cope with large-scale emergen-<lb/>cies, casualty reporting can at best be described as estimated. <lb/>Demographic data <lb/>Having established the locations where fatalities are re-<lb/>ported for each significant earthquake, we computed the <lb/>demographic data from a raster-based global population <lb/>set (9) assembled on a geographic information system. <lb/>The worldwide data set comprises geographically refer-<lb/>enced digital elements, referred to as pixels; each spans an <lb/>area of 1 square kilometer of the earth&apos;s surface. A synopsis <lb/>of the demographic parameters is given in table 1. The <lb/>population density (inhabitants per square kilometer) is au-<lb/>tomatically defined by the value of the population for each <lb/>pixel. The ensembles of the pixels in the demarcated area <lb/>constitute the affected population. <lb/>From these data, it is also possible to calculate the other <lb/>statistical population attributes. Statistical moments on de-<lb/>mographic distribution can be used to differentiate urban <lb/>from rural areas that may have similar total populations <lb/>but widely differing statistical properties. Such differences <lb/>in demographic distribution can be used as surrogate param-<lb/>eters for different construction types (e.g., high-rise build-<lb/>ings or other). For example, demographic statistics may <lb/>discern urban areas surrounded by topographic features as-<lb/>sociated with scarcely populated zones such as lakes or <lb/>mountains; for these cases, we devised a statistical moment <lb/>ratio, obtained from the mean of the squares of the individ-<lb/>ual population pixel values (x) divided by the mean popu-<lb/>lation density ( x) of the area, X m ¼ x 2 = x: <lb/>Physical and environmental data types <lb/>Physical parameters (table 2) such as the earthquake&apos;s <lb/>magnitude and the depth of the hypocenter from the <lb/>TABLE 1.

			<body>epicenter (the point on the earth&apos;s surface vertically above <lb/>the hypocenter) are intrinsic properties of the earthquake <lb/>event that can be obtained from the USGS, which also pro-<lb/>vides their location with geographic coordinates. The posi-<lb/>tion of the earthquake itself is therefore included as an <lb/>information layer on the geographic information system. <lb/>The type of fault that caused the earthquake was not con-<lb/>sidered in the analysis, nor was the distance of the popula-<lb/>tion to major tectonic fault lines. <lb/>Other data types in this group relate to environmental <lb/>factors; they are cataloged as subsidiary layers of the geo-<lb/>graphic information system and are matched to the demo-<lb/>graphic data layers. Thus, the distance from the center of the <lb/>demarcated area to the epicenter; the radius of the circum-<lb/>scribed area; the type of soil; the topographic slope, which <lb/>highlights the placement of the population in special topo-<lb/>graphic areas such as alluvial planes or hilly ground; and the <lb/>hazard-a composite parameter linked to factors such as <lb/>historical seismic activity, maximum ground acceleration, <lb/>landslides, and ground liquefaction (10)-can all be refer-<lb/>enced geographically. Thus, to each population pixel in the <lb/>demarcated area there corresponds a quantified attribute of <lb/>each of the parameters included in our study. From this <lb/>ensemble, it is possible to derive statistical properties of <lb/>these attributes that uniquely characterize the population <lb/>under investigation for each specific earthquake event. <lb/>There has been much speculation as to the time that an <lb/>earthquake hits a population. There would seem to be com-<lb/>pelling reasons to include this information in our analysis, <lb/>so the local time of day when the event occurs is taken into <lb/>account with a simple parameter, activity index, ranging <lb/>from 0 (sleep) to 2 (active or working). <lb/>In the field of earthquake engineering (a branch of engi-<lb/>neering that studies the behavior of structures and buildings <lb/>subject to seismic action), certain parameters play a key role <lb/>in the capacity of an earthquake to cause destruction. Of <lb/>these parameters, the deep geology and the stratigraphic <lb/>profiles that determine the local ground conditions influence <lb/>the attenuation or amplification of seismic waves (11) and <lb/>are considered of fundamental importance in structural seis-<lb/>mic design (12). We are not aware of a worldwide raster data <lb/>set for the aforesaid parameters; instead, the topsoil texture <lb/>(13) is used as a surrogate, which may be indicative of the <lb/>substrate parent rock that generated it. <lb/>Another key factor is the quality of construction, that is, <lb/>the architectural, structural, and material qualities that en-<lb/>able a structure to withstand or dissipate the input energy <lb/>from the earthquake without collapse. In developed coun-<lb/>tries, the quality of housing in earthquake-prone areas has <lb/>improved considerably, and the use of structural steel and <lb/>reinforced concrete has, in general, improved the capacity of <lb/>most structures to withstand earthquakes. In the developing <lb/>world, the quality of the materials and workmanship and the <lb/>more predominant use of brick masonry and adobe as the <lb/>main load-carrying elements make the housing stock more <lb/>vulnerable to earthquakes. We are not aware of a worldwide <lb/>database of housing stock that may be used to assess struc-<lb/>tural build quality; hence, we used the gross domestic prod-<lb/>uct (GDP) per capita (14) of the affected country as an <lb/>indicator of the overall quality of construction and as a sur-<lb/>rogate for vulnerability (15) of the affected population to <lb/>natural disasters. <lb/>Mortality <lb/>Mortality is obtained by dividing the declared number <lb/>of fatalities by the total population in the demarcated area. <lb/>The error sources in estimating the total population inevita-<lb/>bly result in over-and underestimation of mortality. Con-<lb/>versely, over-and underestimation of fatalities will have <lb/>a similar effect. For example, the May 1995 Sakhalin Island <lb/>7.1-magnitude earthquake in Russia resulted in 1,998 re-<lb/>ported fatalities, with a circumscribed population (ac-<lb/>cording to our population data set and the demarcated area <lb/>definition) of only 850. In spite of this incongruence, we <lb/>have no systematic reason to exclude such cases because it <lb/>is to be presumed that examples of overreporting of fatalities <lb/>may statistically balance other examples in which the pop-<lb/>ulation is overestimated. Other errors concern the impact of <lb/>the evolution of demographic trends over time that is not <lb/>taken into account by the global population data set. How <lb/>good can any mortality prediction be when confronted with <lb/>such calibration data? We can claim to study worldwide <lb/>earthquake mortality in statistical terms only. <lb/>Analysis methods <lb/>The analysis assumes that some of the parametric data <lb/>(particularly those corresponding to demographic and casu-<lb/>alty reporting) are contaminated by errors. From the unfil-<lb/>tered data, it is not possible to discern whether the <lb/>correlations of the presumed casualty-inducing parameters <lb/>with mortality are low because they have no influence or <lb/>simply because they represent the complexity of some non-<lb/>linear dependence of mortality on the parameters selected. <lb/>Moreover, a low correlation value is not a sign of noncau-<lb/>sality if the distribution is not Gaussian. We conjecture that <lb/>if a nonlinear correlation exists, filtering will reduce noise <lb/>and highlight the relation between parameters. To do so, we <lb/>screened the data with a moving window averaging filter. <lb/>We examined both the value and the rate of convergence of <lb/>the correlation factors as a function of the filter bandwidth. <lb/>Having first performed a null-hypothesis test on randomly <lb/>generated data, we consider that for the highest filter value <lb/>(32-point average), only those correlations higher than 0.75 <lb/>can be deemed significant. The aim of the analysis, then, is <lb/>to monitor the parametric correlations of mortality as a func-<lb/>tion of the filter bandwidth. We claim that, by so doing, we <lb/>can construct a ranking of the sensitivity of mortality to the <lb/>parameters selected for this study. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>First, we examined the relation between fatalities and <lb/>injuries. Figure 1 shows, on a natural logarithmic scale, <lb/>the evolution of reported casualties ordered in terms of in-<lb/>creasing fatality count for 366 events. Plotting the data se-<lb/>quence in order of increasing fatality count (as opposed to <lb/>chronological order) allows us to observe that the ratio of <lb/>reported fatalities to reported injuries would seem to depend <lb/></body>

			<body>on the severity of the event. Thus, for the most severe earth-<lb/>quakes (thousands of fatalities), the ratio of reported injuries <lb/>to reported fatalities is on the order of 1:1 or less; for mod-<lb/>erate severity earthquakes (hundreds of fatalities), it is ap-<lb/>proximately 10:1; and for the most moderate earthquakes, <lb/>that is, those where tens of fatalities are reported, it is 20:1. <lb/>Overall, the number reported injured (~553,000) exceeds <lb/>that of fatalities (~190,000); however, in the database con-<lb/>structed herein, numerous examples may be found where <lb/>more fatalities than injuries are reported. We cannot claim <lb/>to determine whether the cause of this trend is due to the <lb/>manner of reporting or is a direct result of the severity of the <lb/>event; however, a parallel can be drawn with classes of <lb/>severe man-made disasters, extreme events, and diseases <lb/>that may result in near-complete mortality within the af-<lb/>fected cohort. <lb/>We now discuss the correlations of mortality with the <lb/>remaining parametric data by monitoring the evolution of <lb/>the correlation factors as a function of the size of the filter <lb/>window applied. Given that strong, nonlinear dependencies <lb/>may be introduced by the wide range and standard devia-<lb/>tions within a species (e.g., populations range from tens of <lb/>millions to tens), we take the natural logarithm of the de-<lb/>mographic and human loss data. The correlation coefficients <lb/>for mortality associated with the other parameters for both <lb/>filtered and unfiltered data are given in table 3. <lb/>For the unfiltered data (0-point window filter size), we <lb/>note that the only significant correlations of mortality are <lb/>with the demographic parameters and fatality. The maxi-<lb/>mum population density, the total population, the mean, <lb/>the mean (standard deviation), and X m all approach or ex-<lb/>ceed a negative correlation factor of 0.5. The absolute values <lb/>of the correlation coefficients for depth, magnitude, and <lb/>distance from the epicenter are rather low. This finding re-<lb/>flects the fact that, on an individual event basis, earthquakes <lb/>of high magnitude may not necessarily induce high mortal-<lb/>ity if they do not combine other key factors, such as depth <lb/>and demographic criteria. This statement may seem to play <lb/>down the effect of magnitude, but, as we show later in this <lb/>paper, the average value for the highest-fatality-count earth-<lb/>quakes is in excess of magnitude 7. <lb/>The absolute values of the correlations of magnitude and <lb/>depth increase (respectively, positive and negative, i.e., high <lb/>magnitude, shallow earthquakes increase mortality) with <lb/>TABLE 3.

Likewise, it may <lb/>seem surprising that the correlation of seismic hazard with <lb/>mortality is rather low, but, because most of these events <lb/>take place in hazardous zones, the comparatively small var-<lb/>iations in hazard may be hidden by the conditional depen-<lb/>dence on other factors. The activity coefficient does not <lb/>seem to play a significant role either, indicating perhaps that <lb/>mortality can be equally high when people are congregated <lb/>in buildings either when asleep or during working hours. <lb/>The correlation trends with the demographic data become <lb/>more strongly negative (i.e., nonurban) with filter size, par-<lb/>ticularly regarding maximum population density; the mean, <lb/>mean (standard deviation) density; and X m . The increased <lb/>negative coefficients with total population cannot be trivi-<lb/>ally explained by the fact that mortality is directly derived <lb/>from the ratio of fatalities and total population: from the <lb/>available demographic data at our disposal, there is a clear <lb/>trend that indicates higher mortality in less populated zones. <lb/>For example, the 2001 Bhuj, northwest India, earthquake <lb/>was a relatively low mortality event even though it resulted <lb/>in a high fatality count (above 20,000) where the circum-<lb/>scribed analysis area encompassed a high total population <lb/>(more than 40 million). <lb/>Conversely, the December 2003 earthquake in Bam in <lb/>southeast Iran (not included in this data set) is an example <lb/>of a high-mortality event, for it is believed to have caused <lb/>more than 30,000 fatalities in a population of less than <lb/>200,000 within a 50-km radius of the epicenter. The latter <lb/>is representative of an earthquake occurring in sparsely <lb/>populated semirural areas with no large, highly developed, <lb/>urban centers. These findings are corroborated by the fact <lb/>that X m (which tends to highlight built-up urban areas <lb/>surrounded by sparsely populated zones) is also highly <lb/>negative. <lb/>Also of great relevance, from a humanitarian relief point <lb/>of view, is the increasing negative correlation of GDP per <lb/>capita with mortality. The initial correlation for the unfil-<lb/>tered set is ÿ0.25, whereas, for the 32-point average, it is <lb/>ÿ0.83. However, even though GDP values vary consider-<lb/>ably at both ends of the mortality spectrum for earthquakes <lb/>of similar mortality rank, on average it was observed that <lb/>the high end of the mortality range is populated with lower <lb/>GDP values. Thus, conditional parametric sensitivity im-<lb/>plies that, for all other parameters being equal, we expect <lb/>a higher mortality if the GDP of the affected population is <lb/>low, which is as expected in poor rural communities where <lb/>the structural quality of buildings is lowest. <lb/>We now turn our attention to high-fatality events (i.e., <lb/>those for which more than 500 fatalities are reported); <lb/>of these, 33 events (as shown in figure 2) were compiled <lb/>from the complete 366-event ensemble. It is important to <lb/>note that the average magnitude for the high-fatality earth-<lb/>quake set was just higher than 7. For ease of identification, <lb/>the sequence number now refers to mortality rank. <lb/>For this reduced subset, we tried to predict mortality and <lb/>fatality by using an automatic regression technique based on <lb/>multivariate principle component analysis (16-18). The re-<lb/>sults are shown in figure 2. The most severe earthquakes <lb/>(more than 10,000 fatalities) are identified by their corre-<lb/>sponding mortality sequence rank number on the graphs. <lb/>Severe, high-fatality earthquakes were found at either end <lb/>of the mortality scale; that is, earthquakes of similar mor-<lb/>tality rank may result in widely differing fatality counts. <lb/>The number of fatalities predicted for the 1988 Armenia <lb/>earthquake (figure 2, #31) was 1,500, whereas 25,000 fatal-<lb/>ities were reported. Although the prediction for the 1988 <lb/>west Iran earthquake (#28) was of the order of 10,000 and <lb/>the reported value was 45,000, we propose that, in terms of <lb/>early warning, this would still be a valid reason to set up the <lb/>appropriate emergency procedures. However, the 2001 Bhuj <lb/>(#7) and 1999 Turkey (#29) fatality predictions were more <lb/>accurate. The remaining fatality predictions were consistent <lb/>with the reported values. Finally, the cumulative predicted <lb/>fatality count for the 33-event ensemble was~130,000, <lb/>whereas the reported one was~182,000. Considering that <lb/>the cumulative fatality toll for the complete 366-event en-<lb/>semble was~190,000 implies that the 33-event high-fatality <lb/>ensemble accounted for nearly 95 percent of the reported <lb/>death toll from 1980 until 2001. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>As stated, we have not been able to quantify the errors in <lb/>reported casualties (fatalities and injuries). Likewise, the <lb/>FIGURE 2. Prediction of mortality and fatalities for severe earth-<lb/>quakes worldwide, 1980-2001. In both plots, the data are ordered <lb/>along the x-axis by monotonically increasing mortality rank. The top <lb/>plot shows the predicted and reported mortality values; the bottom plot <lb/>shows the predicted and reported fatality counts. For both plots, <lb/>predicted values are circles and reported values are diamonds. <lb/></body>

			<body>demographic data are subject to a number of error sources. <lb/>In the first instance, even if we assumed an error-free pop-<lb/>ulation database, the fact that the area of the affected pop-<lb/>ulation is not well defined precludes precise quantification <lb/>of the affected population. Secondly, the population data-<lb/>base is itself subject to errors. Finally, we presume that the <lb/>population has remained invariant over the period covered <lb/>by the earthquake data set (1980-2001). Thus, we have not <lb/>considered the effects of seasonal trends such as tourism or <lb/>enforced migration, nor have we attempted to account for <lb/>the long-term demographic trends. <lb/>From our analysis, a pattern emerges of highly vulnerable <lb/>rural and semirural areas with a poorly built environment. In <lb/>fact, of the 50 highest mortality ratios, two thirds are for <lb/>populations with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants. However, <lb/>in terms of total fatalities, the worst earthquakes vary over <lb/>a wide mortality range; the 2001 Bhuj and the 2003 Bam <lb/>earthquakes are contrasting examples. Even though the <lb/>worldwide postearthquake mortality prediction correlation <lb/>for a selected set of high-fatality earthquakes is about 0.93, <lb/>commission (false high fatality alerts) and omission (low <lb/>numbers of fatalities predicted for high-fatality events) er-<lb/>rors occur. We claim that the accuracy of the method im-<lb/>proves when the causal correlations between parametric <lb/>input data and mortality are sufficiently strong, and that, <lb/>when used with more accurate input parameter sets (avail-<lb/>able for the developed world), the accuracy will improve <lb/>further. However, as yet, this is not a truly blind prediction <lb/>method because the demarcated area considered in the pre-<lb/>diction was known beforehand. <lb/>The damaging effects of earthquakes are not limited to the <lb/>immediate morbidity and mortality resulting from the struc-<lb/>tural collapse of buildings. The sequelae of earthquakes may <lb/>result in other pathologies linked to the breakdown of essen-<lb/>tial social services, such as sanitation and the health care <lb/>infrastructure, as well as concomitant factors from chronic <lb/>diseases such as cardiovascular disorders (19-21). This study <lb/>should complement other epidemiologic earthquake mortal-<lb/>ity studies by providing an approximate basis for assessing <lb/>worldwide earthquake mortality and how regional differ-<lb/>ences may attenuate or aggravate the attendant mortality. <lb/></body>
