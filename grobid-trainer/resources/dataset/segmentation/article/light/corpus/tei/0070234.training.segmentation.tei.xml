			<front> Analysis of a Case <lb/> From Paper to Electron: <lb/> How an STM Journal Can Survive the <lb/>Disruptive Technology of the Internet <lb/>KENT R. ANDERSON <lb/> A b s t r a c t  The Internet represents a different type of technology for publishers of <lb/>scientific, technical, and medical journals. It is not a technology that sustains current markets and <lb/>creates new efficiencies but is, rather, a disruptive technology that could radically alter market <lb/>forces, profit expectations, and business models. This paper is a translation and amplification of <lb/>the research done in this area, applied to a large-circulation new science journal, Pediatrics. The <lb/>findings suggest that the journal of the future will be electronic, have a less volatile cost <lb/>structure, be supported more by services than by content, be less able to rely on subscription <lb/>revenues, and abandon certain elements of current value networks. It also provides a possible <lb/>framework for other publishers to use to evaluate their own journals relative to this disruptive <lb/>technology. <lb/> J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2000;7:234–245. <lb/></front> 

			<body>The technologies stemming from the Internet promise <lb/>to bring tremendous and fundamental changes to sci-<lb/>entific, technical, and medical (STM) journal publish-<lb/>ing. Yet, contemporaneously, other technologies with <lb/>similar degrees of complexity and widespread imple-<lb/>mentations have emerged in publishers&apos; lives, but <lb/>with much more welcome and well-controlled effects. <lb/>The Internet represents a different type of technology. <lb/>Most technologies are sustaining technologies, largely <lb/>reinforcing the same markets, work flows, and eco-<lb/>nomic assumptions that existed previously. However, <lb/>the Internet is a technology of another sort, a disrup-<lb/>tive technology, one that profoundly alters market as-<lb/>sumptions, economic models, price points, and mar-<lb/>ket participants. <lb/>The purpose of this paper is to outline the elements <lb/>of the Internet that make it a disruptive technology <lb/>for STM publishers; analyze the metrics and value <lb/>networks associated with its disruptive influence; pro-<lb/>ject time lines for these disruptions for one journal, <lb/> Pediatrics; analyze the economics of migration from <lb/>print to online publication; and develop a possible set <lb/></body>

			<body> of organizational responses for publishers, including <lb/>the publisher of Pediatrics, in response to this disrup-<lb/>tive technology, taking into account the special nature <lb/>of STM journals. It is, simultaneously, an application <lb/>of the conceptual framework developed by Clayton <lb/>Christensen in his 1997 book, The Innovator&apos;s Dilemma,  1 <lb/> to test whether STM publishers are facing a disruptive <lb/>technology in the Internet and, if so, whether recom-<lb/>mendations from his research can be extended to STM <lb/>journals. <lb/> About Pediatrics <lb/> Pediatrics is the official journal of the American Acad-<lb/>emy of Pediatrics (AAP). Published continuously <lb/>since 1948, it has an ISI impact factor of 3.466 (1998) <lb/>and a monthly print run (including overruns for ar-<lb/>chiving) of approximately 62,500. This large circula-<lb/>tion increases variable costs and makes some com-<lb/>parisons with smaller-circulation journals difficult. In <lb/>January 1997, an online-only section of complete, orig-<lb/>inal, peer-reviewed research articles, Pediatrics elec-<lb/>tronic pages, debuted on the Web, with abstracts of <lb/>these articles printed in the paper edition of the jour-<lb/>nal. Abstracts of the articles published in the paper <lb/>edition were also published on line, alongside the con-<lb/>tents of the electronic pages, creating a complemen-<lb/>tary print-and-online publishing model. On the basis <lb/>of the success of this experiment, 2 the full text of the <lb/>journal was placed on line in July 1998, with the elec-<lb/>tronic pages remaining as an online-only section, its <lb/></body>

Since the <lb/>launch of the online-only section of the journal, the <lb/>circulation of Pediatrics has increased from 57,868 to <lb/>61,110. <lb/>Organizationally, Pediatrics is edited by an editor-in-<lb/>chief, an associate editor, two consulting editors, and <lb/>an editorial board of more than 30 members. More <lb/>than 2,500 peer reviewers evaluate the more than <lb/>1,500 research papers that are submitted each year. <lb/>Only 23 percent of the papers submitted to Pediatrics <lb/> are accepted. At the AAP, management oversight for <lb/> Pediatrics resides in the Department of Education. The <lb/>journal is managed primarily by staff in the Division <lb/>of Medical Journals and Professional Periodicals. A <lb/>managing editor provides the majority of the business <lb/>oversight, with the division&apos;s director, the director of <lb/>the Department of Education, and the Academy&apos;s fi-<lb/>nance staff also contributing. The same staff are re-<lb/>sponsible for the print and online versions of Pediat-<lb/>rics. Advertising, both commercial and classified, is <lb/>sold by an outside firm on a commission basis. The <lb/>online version (www.pediatrics.org) is published with <lb/>the assistance of Stanford University&apos;s HighWire <lb/>Press. <lb/>An overview of the journal&apos;s average revenues and <lb/>expenses from January 1996 through July 1999 is <lb/>shown in Table 1. Throughout this analysis, financial <lb/>data are presented as percentages, to effectively dis-<lb/>guise the actual figures while preserving their relative <lb/>values. <lb/>Table 2 shows the change in these revenue and ex-<lb/>pense sources between 1996 and 1999. <lb/>The following points emerge from this revenue and <lb/>expense analysis: <lb/> The relatively stable (even deflationary) paper mar-<lb/>ket has played a role in limiting the increase of var-<lb/>iable costs during the period covered. <lb/> Nonmember subscriptions have declined, and <lb/>stand out as the only declining revenue source in <lb/>the comparison. <lb/> Postal increases have been significant. <lb/> Commercial advertising has become an even more <lb/>important source of revenue for the print version <lb/>of Pediatrics. <lb/> Disruptive vs. Sustaining Technologies <lb/> In The Innovator&apos;s Dilemma,  1 his acclaimed analysis of <lb/>technologically driven change, Clayton M. Christen-<lb/>sen articulates the distinction between a sustaining <lb/> technology and a disruptive technology via studies of <lb/>numerous, diverse industries (including computer <lb/>disk drive manufacturers, excavating equipment, <lb/>discount retailing, and motorcycles). His findings <lb/>strongly suggest that the very business practices that <lb/>count as assets under normal circumstances actually <lb/>accelerate the failure of companies in the presence of <lb/>a disruptive technology. <lb/> Sustaining Technologies <lb/> Sustaining technologies can themselves be radical, but <lb/>they result in improving established products along <lb/>dimensions of performance demanded by traditional <lb/>markets.

			<body> F i g u r e 1 The inevitability of north-<lb/>east on the profit compass. <lb/> Table 3  <lb/> Criteria for a Disruptive Technology <lb/> Markets are not known and are unknowable at beginning. <lb/>Core customers initially reject the new technology. <lb/>Managers hesitate to recommend the technology. <lb/>The technology&apos;s perceived weaknesses are really its strengths. <lb/> Profits and prices are lower for new technology applications. <lb/>The new technology is perceived as underperforming in com-<lb/>parison with existing technologies. <lb/>Markets are viewed as insignificant by entrenched players. <lb/>The new technology heralds a shift in the basis for competition. <lb/>The new technology is simpler, cheaper, and more dependable <lb/>than existing technologies. <lb/>NOTE: The four crucial criteria appear in italics. <lb/> press, and improvements in postal coding (bar coding <lb/>and Zip  4). Essentially, improvements emerged, but <lb/>the same value network existed after these changes <lb/>were implemented. <lb/> Disruptive Technologies <lb/> Disruptive technologies are qualitatively different <lb/>from sustaining technologies. They are attractive to <lb/>previously unanticipated markets, are often disdained <lb/>by established market forces in their early stages, yet <lb/>are able to survive as smaller entities until the tech-<lb/>nology becomes more mainstream and is proved, at <lb/>which time they may exceed market demands of <lb/>value and overtake existing players, supplanting or <lb/>subsuming them. They fundamentally alter the value <lb/>equations of the market and the measurements of <lb/>value that the market uses to gauge providers. <lb/> North by Northeast <lb/> This motivation for established companies to move <lb/>up-market over time (an orientation that tracks north-<lb/>easterly when graphed, as shown in Figure 1) trans-<lb/>forms into inertia over time, as incumbents that sur-<lb/>vive such competition (that is, end up in the high <lb/>northeast corner of the price, value, and size graph) <lb/>are typically large, have high overhead costs (salaries, <lb/>fringe benefits, staff size, and facilities), possess rigid <lb/>manufacturing processes (to reduce product variabil-<lb/>ity), and support significant distribution networks. <lb/>These companies consist of management teams that <lb/>function in a highly structured fashion, and the per-<lb/>sonal ambition of each manager makes recommend-<lb/>ing a new venture with the attributes of a disruptive <lb/>technology (no known market, less revenue, core cus-<lb/>tomer rejection of concept, etc.) highly unlikely. Estab-<lb/>lished firms are effectively forced into a set of pro-<lb/>scribed behaviors by these factors, the primary one <lb/>being the fear of moving southwesterly. <lb/> Meanwhile, a new entrant, starting at the opposite, <lb/>southwestern corner, is initially geared to survive in <lb/>an environment consisting of low overheads, pos-<lb/>sesses flexible manufacturing processes, and holds <lb/>limited distribution and property, plant, and equip-<lb/>ment commitments. If the new entrant possesses a <lb/>disruptive technology, movement up-market may oc-<lb/>cur very rapidly, and the entrant may be able to de-<lb/>liver more value than its rival in both the newly dis-<lb/>covered markets and traditional markets for the <lb/>displaced technology. By virtue of years of experience <lb/>with the disruptive technology, the new entrant often <lb/>shows more market and technical savvy, may hold <lb/>key patents, has important recognition among the <lb/>newly discovered markets and value network, and <lb/>most often triumphs even when the established firm <lb/>attempts to replicate the new entrant&apos;s technology. <lb/></body>

			<body> The Internet as a Disruptive Technology <lb/> Table 3 illustrates the ways in which a disruptive tech-<lb/>nology can be identified, with the most crucial four <lb/>criteria listed first in italics. <lb/>While the segment of the current core market for Pe-<lb/> diatrics online is relatively small compared with the <lb/>entire subscribership (12 percent of total readership <lb/>actively uses the online version), the rate of growth of <lb/>this market is the more important indicator. (The pos-<lb/>sible significance of this is covered later.) Also, the <lb/>nonsubscriber use of the site is significant (about <lb/>40,000 unique users per month), as are per-article use <lb/>and occasional use of the site. These are intriguing, <lb/>suggestive tensions—a small but rapidly growing use <lb/>by core customers; a larger, unknown market of oc-<lb/>casional users; and appreciable per-article traffic. <lb/>We have also found that we can reduce the price of <lb/>an online-only subscription by approximately 40 per-<lb/>cent while maintaining the same margins, assuming <lb/>stable commercial advertising revenues. We have <lb/>offered online-only subscriptions to the segment of <lb/>our market for whom delivery is most problematic— <lb/>international subscribers. So far, more than 125 sub-<lb/>scribers have accepted this option, with many other <lb/>international subscribers expressing gratitude for im-<lb/>mediate access to the online version. We have also <lb/>received a number of requests from domestic sub-<lb/>scribers to stop sending print copies; we have not <lb/>honored these requests yet, since doing so may be <lb/>perceived as placing our advertising rate base at un-<lb/>necessary risk. This is clearly a symptom of manage-<lb/>ment frozen by a business model and revenue expec-<lb/>tations emanating from the print paradigm. <lb/>We have also noticed a significant increase in the <lb/>amount of direct service we offer for Pediatrics. E-mail <lb/>places us much closer to our customers, and the ex-<lb/>pectation of rapid response is clear. We have aggres-<lb/>sively added services to the online journal (data re-<lb/>trieval, presentation, and communication services), <lb/>which are not possible in print. While the quality of <lb/>information was paramount previously, the basis for <lb/>competition may be shifting to accessibility, search-<lb/>ability, granularity of content, and services around the <lb/>information. <lb/> Disruption to STM Journal Value Networks <lb/> For print STM journals, a hypothetic value network is <lb/>shown in Table 4. The table is organized roughly in <lb/>reverse sequence (closest to customer vs. furthest from <lb/>customer). This value network clearly shows some of <lb/>the major value elements harnessed by publishers. Ta-<lb/>ble 5 shows the hypothetic value network for an online <lb/> STM journal. The differences between the two value <lb/>networks include: <lb/> The collapse of the printer and distributor catego-<lb/>ries from the print paradigm into online vendors <lb/>for the online paradigm <lb/> The removal of libraries as key providers of struc-<lb/>tured access and archiving for STM journals <lb/> The removal of subscription agencies as providers <lb/>of consolidated subscription purchasing <lb/> The diminution of advertisers, at least initially, for <lb/>STM journals <lb/> Printers and Distributors Become Online <lb/>Vendors <lb/> The economics of printing, with volatile paper costs <lb/>and, for STM publishers, disadvantageous postal reg-<lb/>ulations, are bound to give way to the lower and less <lb/>variable costs of Internet publishing. With computer <lb/>prices falling and other electronic delivery modalities <lb/>(e.g., palm-top and electronic book technologies) mat-<lb/>ing with Internet technologies, 3 it is only a matter of <lb/>time before market penetration and technologic <lb/>strides make having, carrying, reading, and updating <lb/>Internet publications convenient and inexpensive. For <lb/> Pediatrics, an extensive analysis of 3.5 years of print-<lb/>ing invoices, page counts, and other measurements <lb/>showed that an average of 84.6 percent of our variable <lb/>expense has been consumed solely by the costs of pa-<lb/>per, printing, and postage (see Table 1). For Pediatrics, <lb/> moving on line would eliminate 43.82 percent of our <lb/>overall costs (fixed and variable), mainly by eliminat-<lb/>ing 88.73 percent of our variable costs. <lb/>A spike in paper prices or continuation of current <lb/>postal trends could precipitate an aggressive move-<lb/>ment by publishers toward online publishing. The <lb/>proliferation of online resources has occurred during <lb/>a period of flat paper prices, probably leading to some <lb/>inertia on the part of publishers. Postal regulations <lb/>continue to favor large-volume, lightweight pub-<lb/>lications and punish small-volume, heavier publi-<lb/>cations. Pricing of raw materials and current delivery <lb/>modalities may drive STM publishers on line, in a <lb/>rearguard action. <lb/> Removal of Libraries as Key Providers of <lb/>Structured Access and Archiving <lb/> In recent years, library subscriptions to journals have <lb/>fallen as prices for STM journals have skyrocketed. 4 <lb/></body>

Services like PubMed and MEDLINE already make <lb/>this possible to a large extent, and the first peer-re-<lb/>viewed research article relying solely on Internet re-<lb/>sources for bibliographic research has been written, <lb/>reviewed, accepted, and published. In addition, a re-<lb/>cent study comparing hand searching of bibliographic <lb/>citations by a trained librarian and a computer search <lb/>of MEDLINE showed that the computer search yielded <lb/>comparable results and an improvement over similar <lb/>earlier trials (an improvement trajectory). 6 Finally, the <lb/>nature of the Internet makes the collection of infor-<lb/>mation much less rare. It has even been said by some <lb/>that the emergence of the online journal &apos;&apos;is seen as a <lb/>savior for libraries concerned with STM fields,&apos;&apos; in that <lb/>it may solve the pricing dilemmas libraries face. 5 In <lb/>short, libraries may wish to fall out of the print STM <lb/>journal value network. Denmark&apos;s National Technical <lb/>Knowledge Center and Library has already phased <lb/>out journals altogether, delivering journal content to <lb/>patrons solely via the Web. 4 <lb/> Also, completing the move to online-only journals <lb/>may rid libraries of the new problem of having mul-<lb/>tiple online versions of the same journal content in <lb/>place—one version from the publisher, two from dif-<lb/>ferent document delivery companies, and perhaps an <lb/>archival CD-ROM for storage. <lb/>These redundancies in the current market also may be <lb/></body>

Elements that do not translate from the <lb/>print paradigm are libraries, printers, distributors, and subscription agents. Advertisers may be diminished by the resulting business <lb/>models. <lb/> disadvantageous for publishers. The staff of Pediatrics <lb/> recently completed an analysis of 20 representative <lb/>markets served by a major online document delivery <lb/>company (which currently provides a transitional <lb/>model of online publishing). The results showed a <lb/>nonmember subscriber attrition rate more than double <lb/>our average rate (23.65 vs. 11.35 percent), and the de-<lb/>crease in individual nonmember subscription reve-<lb/>nues mentioned earlier (see Table 2) was strongly as-<lb/>sociated with the increase in royalties from this <lb/>document delivery service (r 2 = 96.37 percent; F criti-<lb/>cal = 0.1219; F observed = 26.58). Aggressively moving <lb/>online may help publishers remove these aspects of <lb/>interference and redundancy between them and their <lb/>customers. <lb/> Removal of Subscription Agencies as Providers <lb/>of Consolidated Subscription Purchasing <lb/> The convenience factor of subscription agencies for in-<lb/>stitutions, libraries, and other large organizations has <lb/>to do with the traditionally decentralized nature of <lb/>publishers. With the Internet, online agents have al-<lb/>ready emerged, offering click-through ordering, order <lb/>recall for modification in subsequent years, and other <lb/>services. The linkages that will develop over time be-<lb/>tween publishers and customers via the Internet <lb/>should sufficiently disintermediate subscription agen-<lb/>cies&apos; services. Also, the price premiums agencies de-<lb/>mand from both publishers and customers will prob-<lb/>ably be revealed as unsustainable by this disruptive <lb/>technology. A few entrepreneurial newcomers only need <lb/>apply existing technology to displace the agencies. <lb/> Diminution of Advertisers <lb/> Commercial advertisers contribute approximately 31 <lb/>percent of the gross revenues generated each year by <lb/> Pediatrics. Primarily, the advertisements are for phar-<lb/>maceutical products, vaccines, or over-the-counter <lb/>preparations. Because of the cost savings generated by <lb/>migration on line, a large portion of these revenues <lb/>can be foregone. Also, because online advertising is <lb/></body>

With di-<lb/>minished pressure to secure these revenues and a <lb/>nonaggressive approach to Internet advertising by <lb/>pharmaceutical companies and other traditional ad-<lb/>vertisers, online publishers will probably feel less <lb/>pressure to accommodate advertisers or retain adver-<lb/>tising representatives at the level they currently do. <lb/>For example, the cost savings of complete Internet <lb/>publishing combined with the lost revenues from <lb/>commercial advertising would leave Pediatrics at an <lb/>average of 83.9 percent of its current profit levels (Ta-<lb/>ble 6). A 16.1 percent loss in profit is significant, but <lb/>not calamitous. Other opportunities in these unknown <lb/>and unknowable markets could offset this effect. <lb/> This assumes, of course, that subscription models con-<lb/>tinue to provide current levels of revenues on a sus-<lb/>tainable basis, but the success of e-commerce in many <lb/>applications, and our experience with this for the pur-<lb/>chase of both single articles and online-only subscrip-<lb/>tions, suggest that value translates effectively into <lb/>transactions over the Internet. However, the increased <lb/>granularity of information (article-specific instead of <lb/>issue-specific or title-specific) over the Internet may <lb/>threaten subscription models fundamentally, with <lb/>users finding articles via search engines, purchasing <lb/>just what they need, and moving on. Future purchas-<lb/>ers of journal content may not feel the need to sub-<lb/>scribe. The protection offered by having journal sub-<lb/>scriptions tied to society membership may provide <lb/>some safety in this regard. <lb/> Publisher vs. Market Value Metrics <lb/> A list of possible value metrics for print and online <lb/>journals is shown in Table 7. <lb/>Publishers may infer that competitive forces in print <lb/>or online markets will be similar (e.g., better presen-<lb/>tation and strong authors would be equally weighted <lb/>assets in either environment). However, publishers <lb/>also need to consider two special questions raised by <lb/>a disruptive technology: <lb/> Whether nontraditional, online sources of pub-<lb/>lished research can exceed market expectations in <lb/>many or all of these value metrics <lb/> Whether the revenue levels achieved in this pursuit <lb/>will provide competitors in the disruptive technol-<lb/>ogy environment with the resources they need to <lb/>continue to move northeasterly in the value com-<lb/>pass <lb/>Figure 2 shows a possible level that online STM jour-<lb/>nals may have reached by late 1999 in terms of a sum-<lb/>mary set of STM journal value metrics. It is possible <lb/>that only readability, portability, and archival integrity <lb/>will remain as distinguishing value metrics. <lb/>It is important to emphasize, as Christensen 1 does, <lb/>that to succeed, new entrants do not need to match <lb/>existing levels of peer review, indexing, or contribu-<lb/>tions to academic credibility. Instead, new entrants <lb/>need to satisfy only the market&apos;s minimum standards <lb/>in these areas. Publishers may have, unwittingly, far <lb/>exceeded the minimum standards in these areas for <lb/></body>

In fact, they may not know what these <lb/>minimal standards are. The entry of a disruptive tech-<lb/>nology allows markets to realign along true market <lb/> value metrics. <lb/>Two major value metrics—inclusion in MEDLINE and <lb/>society affiliation—may serve to protect the status <lb/>quo of STM journal publishing and may seem less <lb/>susceptible to technologic disruption. However, with <lb/>the ability of PubMed to accept materials almost im-<lb/>mediately into its very active and accessible index of <lb/>a broader variety of literature sources, the MEDLINE <lb/> value metric may be made less critical because of tech-<lb/>nology (e.g., XML), novel audience expectations, and <lb/>the inability of manual systems to match the speed of <lb/>more automated systems. Also, new metrics of value <lb/>may compete with MEDLINE inclusion, such as infor-<lb/>mation about citation impact factors (i.e., measures of <lb/>utility in the literature), which is becoming more <lb/>timely and accessible than ever. It may someday be <lb/>possible to score the quality of an article&apos;s heritage (as <lb/>well as the lineage of a journal&apos;s contents, and thus <lb/>its relevance to current research) by quantifying in <lb/>some manner the impact factors of an article&apos;s sources, <lb/>the article itself, and the journal in which it appears. <lb/>The effects of networked journals have yet to be felt <lb/>on a broad scale. <lb/> When Can We Anticipate Disruption? <lb/> From a study of one year of online subscription use <lb/>and linear extrapolation from these data, it appears <lb/>that more than half the readers of Pediatrics will be <lb/>active users of the online version of the journal within <lb/>51 months from July 1998, which translates to October <lb/>2002. Using the same data, but taking out the current <lb/>rate of adoption until 100 percent conversion is <lb/>achieved, we project that the migration from print to <lb/>online publication would take 103 months to com-<lb/>plete, until sometime in the year 2007. <lb/>The Internet is a disruptive technology, and such tech-<lb/>nologies generally follow a typical product life-cycle <lb/> </body>

			<body> F i g u r e 3 Online subscription <lb/>activations for the online ver-<lb/>sion of Pediatrics. <lb/> F i g u r e 4 Pearl curve for adop-<lb/>tion of online version of Pedi-<lb/>atrics. <lb/> curve, or S curve. 7 The point at which an online jour-<lb/>nal is projected to reach its mature stage (inflection <lb/>point) seems to be the point at which an STM journal <lb/>would finally cross the line from print to online pub-<lb/>lication. It appears that Pediatrics online is just moving <lb/>from the &apos;&apos;early adoption&apos;&apos; phase into the &apos;&apos;rapid <lb/>growth&apos;&apos; phase (Figure 3). A Pearl curve shows that <lb/>the current rate of adoption for Pediatrics online is <lb/>more than sufficient to migrate the entire readership <lb/>online. Based on this these calculations, the rate of <lb/>growth observed thus far would support migration of <lb/>420,000 subscribers before the S-curve inflection point <lb/>would occur (at 95 percent CI; 13.21 percent MAPE). <lb/>This strongly suggests that migration for Pediatrics is a <lb/>plausible outcome of our online publishing initiatives. <lb/>Extending the S curve yielded by this logistic curve <lb/>analysis and using the resulting formulas to calculate <lb/>the point at which 100 percent of the current subscriber <lb/>base would be active on line, the result is 33 months. <lb/>This assumes that the S-curve model is valid for this <lb/>data set and that the curve of accelerated growth noted <lb/>in Figure 3 continues as indicated in Figure 4. <lb/>The capacity of the Internet is increasing at a faster rate <lb/>than is computing power (Moore&apos;s law), with both fi-<lb/>beroptic technologies and router speeds generating in-<lb/>creases of a factor of 1,000 in just 25 years. 7 As of 1997, <lb/>more than 60 percent of surveyed pediatricians stated <lb/>that they had a modem on their computer and access <lb/>to the Internet. 8 Also in 1997, a study by the U.S. Cen-<lb/>sus Bureau showed that more than 80 percent of pri-<lb/>mary school students have access to the Internet in ei-<lb/>ther their schools or homes. 9 <lb/> These two statistical glosses on the available data re-<lb/>veal a possible &apos;&apos;window of disruption,&apos;&apos; shown in Fig-<lb/>ure 5. While this analysis relies on divergent statistical <lb/>approaches that generate some problematic tensions <lb/>between the conclusions, and therefore must be ac-<lb/>cepted as a current &apos;&apos;best guess&apos;&apos; requiring monitoring <lb/>and recalculations, the following statements may be <lb/>made with some confidence: <lb/></body>

			<body> F i g u r e 5 Possible &apos;&apos;window <lb/>of disruption&apos;&apos; for Pediatrics. <lb/>  General adoption of online journals seems to lag <lb/>behind that of the Internet as a technology, as illus-<lb/>trated by the 2002 date for 50 percent adoption by <lb/> Pediatrics subscribers of the online version of the <lb/>journal, and other data. 8,9 <lb/>  The S curve for the adoption of this technology for <lb/> Pediatrics indicates the start of an accelerated phase, <lb/>and the rate of adoption of the online version <lb/>clearly supports the migration of the entire sub-<lb/>scription base. <lb/> Adoption by the complete subscriber base will <lb/>probably occur earlier rather than later, given the <lb/>data points shown in Figure 5. <lb/> Caveats for STM Journal Publishers <lb/> Christensen&apos;s original research is highly suggestive <lb/>but not completely translatable to the STM publishing <lb/>environment. First, his research itself may change the <lb/>environment and the assumptions under which estab-<lb/>lished firms behave regarding disruptive technolo-<lb/>gies, allowing them to identify such technologies by <lb/>logical criteria (see Table 3) and anticipate and avoid <lb/>typical problems. Second, many societies tend to <lb/>have very different operating environments from the <lb/>for-profit, commodity-driven businesses Christensen <lb/>studied. Third, the presence of independent and rel-<lb/>atively unassailed value metrics such as peer-review <lb/>and MEDLINE make replicating the &apos;&apos;commodity&apos;&apos; of an <lb/>STM journal more difficult for new entrants. Finally, <lb/>the commodity in question with STM journals is more <lb/>akin to intellectual property than to commodities like <lb/>steel, disk drives, or motorbikes. There is nothing in <lb/>Christensen&apos;s research to suggest how a disruptive <lb/>technology may affect a business based largely on in-<lb/>tellectual property rather than on more traditional <lb/>commodities and raw materials. <lb/>Intellectual properties may be more malleable, and <lb/>hence less prone to disruption, than hard goods or <lb/>pure commodities. However, this same malleability <lb/>may be used to work against entrenched STM jour-<lb/>nals, either by document delivery companies with <lb/>competitive business models or by new entrants using <lb/>a disruptive technology and gaining access to strong <lb/>intellectual properties. <lb/> How STM Publishers May Deal with <lb/>Disruption <lb/> Faced with changing market emphases, a disruptive <lb/>technology, and management practices that are coun-<lb/>terproductive, the options for an STM publisher seem <lb/>few. However, Christensen&apos;s research showed two <lb/>successful management approaches to this dilemma. <lb/>The first is to spin off a separate, majority-owned <lb/>company to develop the new markets and integrate <lb/>the disruptive technology. The second is to acquire <lb/>expertise later by buying a company that has success-<lb/>fully developed new markets, integrated the disrup-<lb/>tive technology, and perhaps even assailed one&apos;s tra-<lb/>ditional markets. 1 <lb/> The latter option, which we consider first, poses two <lb/>difficulties for STM publishers. First, the capital out-<lb/>lay to acquire a growing Internet company would <lb/>probably be beyond the reach of all but the largest <lb/>STM publishers, especially with current valuations of <lb/>these companies in the public sector; second, the man-<lb/>agement decisions that would preclude effectively in-<lb/></body>

			<body>tegrating a disruptive technology would probably <lb/>also lead to the rejection of this idea at some point. <lb/>Also, once the acquisition were made, pre-existing <lb/>management expectations and practices might lead to <lb/>an uncomfortable and possibly unproductive match. <lb/>Therefore, this is not a very advisable option. <lb/>On the other hand, creating a self-sufficient, majority-<lb/>owned spin-off devoted to developing the new tech-<lb/>nology has a number of advantages, including: <lb/> Realistic and attainable profit expectations <lb/> Freedom to experiment and probe the unknown <lb/>markets <lb/> The opportunity to tailor the organizational struc-<lb/>ture, incentives for performance, pricing models, <lb/>and management philosophies to the disruptive <lb/>technology and its true markets <lb/> The opportunity to completely explore and exploit <lb/>the disruptive technology, once it is mature, which <lb/>the parent organization can then reintegrate <lb/> Creation of an enduring business form that is not <lb/>subject to incompatible management whims and ir-<lb/>relevant financial pressures <lb/> Complete reintegration into the parent entity and <lb/>preservation of all derived benefits, once disruptive <lb/>forces have abated. <lb/> Conclusion <lb/> STM publishers facing disruption from the Internet <lb/>can consider the following priorities: <lb/> Create an enduring business structure capable of <lb/>exploiting the new cost mix and markets of the In-<lb/>ternet <lb/> Build services around the information <lb/> Create pathways for more granular, selective access <lb/>to published information <lb/> Experiment with new publishing modalities spring-<lb/>ing from Internet publishing <lb/> Begin orienting business models and strategic <lb/>thinking toward this disruptive technology as soon <lb/>as possible <lb/>Ultimately, this translation of Christensen&apos;s research <lb/>gives rise to three important messages for STM pub-<lb/>lishers. First, the presence of a disruptive technology <lb/>in publishers&apos; lives is virtually unique. Arguably, the <lb/>last legitimate disruption on this scale occurred with <lb/>Johann Gutenberg&apos;s implementation of movable metal <lb/>type for high-quality printing, more than 450 years <lb/>ago, so there are few precedents or guides available <lb/>for publishers today. Second, the market&apos;s value met-<lb/>rics may differ from the value metrics we currently <lb/>use in the print publishing paradigm, and the markets <lb/>will be the primary forces that determine the new hi-<lb/>erarchy of STM journal value relative to the Internet. <lb/>Finally, sound management practices of listening to <lb/>core customers, driving profits northeasterly, and al-<lb/>locating resources to winning programs may acceler-<lb/>ate the disruption of conventional business. <lb/> Findings Particular to Pediatrics and a Possible <lb/>Strategic Response <lb/> It is clear from this analysis that Pediatrics is being <lb/>disrupted by the Internet and that the disruption will <lb/>continue throughout the entire subscriber base. The <lb/>implications are as follows: <lb/> The rate of adoption of the online version of the <lb/>journal appears sufficient to support migration of <lb/>the complete subscriber base to online publication <lb/>early in the 21st century. <lb/> Variable costs should diminish in this scenario, in-<lb/>creasing net revenues from subscriptions and re-<lb/>ducing the need for ancillary revenue streams (e.g., <lb/>advertising) while also improving the speed and <lb/>consistency of service. <lb/> Pediatrics has already experienced disruption via a <lb/>major online document delivery service. <lb/> The management and leadership of Pediatrics will <lb/>require an even greater degree of autonomy during <lb/>this transition to propose and act on plans that may <lb/>seem, in the short term and relative to conventional <lb/>management expectations, counter-intuitive if this <lb/>migration is to be as low-risk and productive as <lb/>possible. A possible approach to ensuring this au-<lb/>tonomy would be for the AAP to establish a sepa-<lb/>rate, majority-owned online publishing subsidiary <lb/>with independent fiscal goals, complete access to all <lb/>AAP information resources, autonomous manage-<lb/>ment structures, and a plan for ultimate reintegra-<lb/>tion once the transitions to new markets via this <lb/>disruptive technology are completed. <lb/> Services ancillary to the content of the journal will <lb/>become increasingly important as a basis for com-<lb/>petition among STM journals in this new publish-<lb/>ing environment and as a basis for competition <lb/></body>

This phenomenon may actually be a <lb/>sign of health, showing that the journal is adapting <lb/>to the disruptive technology and the new econom-<lb/>ics of publishing that the technology dictates. We <lb/>can also anticipate that revenues will decrease in a <lb/>more controlled fashion if management is allowed the <lb/>freedom and flexibility to adapt rapidly and com-<lb/>pletely to this disruptive technology. <lb/></body>
