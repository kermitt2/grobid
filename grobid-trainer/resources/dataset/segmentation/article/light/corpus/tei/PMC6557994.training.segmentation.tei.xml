Low serum level <lb/>of MBL is reported to be associated with an increased risk of arthritis. However, the <lb/>underlying mechanism by which MBL contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis is <lb/>poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the precise role of MBL on the course <lb/>of experimental murine adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). MBL-deficient (MBL −/− ) AIA <lb/>mice showed significantly increased inflammatory responses compared with wild-type <lb/>C57BL/6 AIA mice, including exacerbated cartilage damage, enhanced histopathological <lb/>features and high level of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells. <lb/>MBL protein markedly inhibited the osteoclast formation from human blood monocytes <lb/>induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage <lb/>colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in vitro. Mechanistic studies established that MBL <lb/>inhibited osteoclast differentiation via down-regulation of p38 signaling pathway and <lb/>subsequent nuclear translocation of c-fos as well as activation of nuclear factor of <lb/>activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) pathway.

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Osteoclasts are specialized multinucleated cells derived from precursors in the myeloid/monocyte <lb/>lineage which resorb bone matrix. Destruction of the joint, in the progression of inflammatory <lb/>arthritis, is mainly attributed to the osteoclast differentiation and the upregulation of <lb/>osteoclast-related proteins (1).

			<body>nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-<lb/>stimulating factor (M-CSF), are required for the osteoclast <lb/>formation (2). Sufficient osteoclast differentiation relied on the <lb/>establishment of specific patterns of gene expression achieved <lb/>through activation of transcription factors such as PU.1, <lb/>microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), c-Fos, c-Myc, NF-<lb/>kappaB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor-<lb/>activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) (3, 4). Among these, NFATc1 <lb/>is the most highly inducible transcription factor in osteoclast <lb/>precursor cells and act as a master regulator of osteoclast <lb/>differentiation through upregulating the osteoclast-specific genes <lb/>such as cathepsin K (CTSK), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase <lb/>(TRAP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and osteoclast-<lb/>associated receptor (OSCAR), thereby promoting the cells fuse <lb/>to TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (3, 5, 6). Subsequently, <lb/>osteoclast differentiation results in bone resorption through <lb/>activation of the RANKL/RANK/osteoprotegerin axis. It is <lb/>of critical importance to broaden our understanding of the <lb/>molecular mechanisms that control the osteoclastogenesis during <lb/>the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. <lb/>Mannan-binding lectin (MBL, also called mannose-binding <lb/>lectin) is a prototypic pattern recognition molecule of the innate <lb/>immune system, primarily synthesized in the liver and is mostly <lb/>found in the blood (7, 8). MBL can distinguish between the <lb/>carbohydrates found on self-glycoproteins and the carbohydrate <lb/>patterns found on infectious non-self surfaces and initiates the <lb/>complement cascade through the lectin pathway (7, 9). It is <lb/>now evident that MBL deficiency is associated with different <lb/>infectious and autoimmune diseases (10). Previous clinical <lb/>studies demonstrated that low serum level of MBL predisposes <lb/>to the development of arthritis and is a risk factor for severity <lb/>and treatment outcome (11-13). It is noteworthy to mention <lb/>that we previously observed MBL at high concentrations could <lb/>suppress the transition of monocytes to dendritic cells (DCs) <lb/>in the culture condition for DC differentiation (14). Besides, <lb/>MBL limited the maturation of monocyte-derived DCs induced <lb/>by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via inhibiting NF-κB activation <lb/>(15). Indeed, MBL can bind to monocytes and modulates <lb/>inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein levels in response <lb/>to LPS stimulation (16, 17). Therefore, it is possible that MBL <lb/>might influence the differentiation of monocytes into TRAP-<lb/>positive osteoclasts and subsequently involved in inflammatory <lb/>Abbreviations: IA, adjuvant-induced arthritis; AP-1, activator protein-1; BMP, <lb/>bone morphogenetic proteins; CFA, complete Freund&apos;s adjuvant; CTR, calcitonin <lb/>receptor; CTSK, cathepsin K; β-CTX, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; <lb/>DC, dendritic cell; DC-STAMP, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein; <lb/>ECM, extracellular matrix; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ESR, <lb/>erythrocyte sedimentation rate; FBS, fetal bovine serum; H&amp;E, hematoxylin and <lb/>eosin; IFA, incomplete Freund&apos;s adjuvant; IHC, immunohistochemical; JNK, c-<lb/>Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAC, membrane attack complex; <lb/>MBL, Mannan-binding lectin; M-CSF, Macrophage colony-stimulating factor; <lb/>MITF, microphthalmia transcription factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; <lb/>NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1; NF-κB, NF-kappaB; OPG, <lb/>Osteoprotegerin; OSCAR, osteoclast-associated receptor; PINP, amino-terminal <lb/>propeptide of type I procollagen; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; RA, Rheumatoid <lb/>arthritis; RF, rheumatoid factor; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB <lb/>ligand; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; WT, wild-type. <lb/>bone destruction, which, however, so far has no evidence to <lb/>support it. <lb/>Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) is a widely used <lb/>experimental model for the study of inflammatory arthritis <lb/>(18, 19). A great number of osteoclast precursors, as well as <lb/>osteoclasts, were generated immediately after the onset of AIA, <lb/>and these cells were found in the subcompartments of the <lb/>joints (20). In this study, we used MBL-deficient (MBL −/− ) <lb/>mice to generate AIA for evaluating the function MBL on <lb/>the process of inflammatory arthritis, especially the formation <lb/>and function of osteoclasts. The results showed that MBL −/− <lb/>mice were susceptible to AIA and exhibited substantially <lb/>increased osteoclast formation. In vitro study revealed that MBL <lb/>dose-dependently inhibited the RANKL-induced osteoclast <lb/>differentiation by suppressing the p38/c-fos/NFATc1 signaling <lb/>axis. It is noteworthy that we demonstrated that arthritis patients <lb/>had low serum levels of MBL compared with healthy donors <lb/>and that concentrations of MBL correlated negatively with the <lb/>levels of amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) <lb/>and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX), serum <lb/>markers for osteoclastic activity, in patients with arthritis. In <lb/>summary, our findings provide the first line of evidence that <lb/>MBL might have potential anti-osteoclastogenic effects, which <lb/>offers insight into the disease mechanisms of inflammatory <lb/>arthritis and other bone-related diseases, especially in patients <lb/>with MBL deficiency. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Patient Samples and Mice <lb/>Thirty four serum samples of patients with arthritis were <lb/>recruited at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou <lb/>University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Guangzhou, China) <lb/>from January 2018 to June 2018.

Sections were then incubated with <lb/>primary antibodies at 4 • C overnight. Immuno-reactivity was <lb/>detected using the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary <lb/>antibody and visualized using diaminobenzidine kit (Beyotime <lb/>Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). <lb/>Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) <lb/>Analysis <lb/>Knee joints were scanned using a skyscan micro-CT scanner <lb/>(Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) with X-ray beam settings of 50 kV <lb/>and 50 µA. Trabecular bone regions of interest were selected by <lb/>highlighting trabecular bone regions for cross-sectional slices of <lb/>the hind limb and bone architecture determined by quantifying <lb/>trabecular bone parameters using CTAN software. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>All values were expressed as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was <lb/>used for comparisons among multiple groups. Differences <lb/>between two groups in the experiments were analyzed <lb/>by Student&apos;s t-test. Value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered <lb/>statistically significant. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>MBL Deficiency Promotes the Progression <lb/>of Mouse AIA and Associated With <lb/>Enhanced Inflammatory Mediator <lb/>To explore the pathogenic role of MBL in inflammatory arthritis <lb/>disease, we developed AIA in MBL −/− and paired WT mice. <lb/>Histological analysis of knee joints after adjuvant injection <lb/>demonstrated that MBL −/− mice showed severe joint damage <lb/>compared with WT counterparts (Figure 1A). Besides, MBL −/− <lb/>mice exhibited more osteoporosis and collagen deposition than <lb/>WT mice during the development of arthritis (Figures 1B,C). <lb/>Moreover, there was significantly more destruction of the <lb/>bone and cartilage in the adjuvant-treated MBL −/− mice than <lb/>those in WT controls (Figures 1D,E). We also examined and <lb/>compared the expression of inflammatory cytokines between <lb/>adjuvant-treated WT and MBL −/− mice. The result showed that <lb/>aggravated joint damage in MBL −/− mice was accompanied by <lb/>a significant elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, <lb/>TNF-α, and IL-6) and reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokine <lb/>IL-10 in hind paw (Figure 1F). <lb/>Using the established murine model of AIA, the impact <lb/>of MBL on bone architecture was evaluated by micro-<lb/>CT analysis. Qualitative analysis of the three-dimensional <lb/>reconstruction of the knee joints (Figure 2A) confirmed that <lb/>MBL had been able to prevent the external focal erosion on <lb/>the periarticular surfaces. Similarly, longitudinal mid-sections <lb/>(Figure 2B) and transaxial (Figure 2C) images of knee joint <lb/>showed a reduction in trabecular bone mass in MBL −/− mice <lb/>upon adjuvant injection. Compared with WT AIA mice, the <lb/>MBL −/− AIA mice exhibited decreased bone volume/tissue <lb/>volume (BV/TV) (Figure 2D), reduced trabecular number <lb/>(Tb.N) (Figure 2E) and declined trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) <lb/>(Figure 2F). Concomitantly, the trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) <lb/>of MBL −/− AIA mice was significantly higher than that of <lb/>WT counterparts (Figure 2G). Together, these results indicate <lb/>a potential protective role of MBL in the pathogenesis of <lb/>experimental AIA. <lb/>MBL Deficiency Facilitates Osteoclast <lb/>Formation in Mice AIA <lb/>Accumulating evidence pointed out that the increased <lb/>osteoclastic activity is responsible for bone loss or joint <lb/>destruction during the development of inflammatory arthritis <lb/>(21). To determine the role of MBL in osteoclastogenesis, <lb/>TRAP staining was performed on the bone sections isolated <lb/>from adjuvant-treated WT and MBL −/− mice. The result <lb/>demonstrated that a massive increase in numbers of osteoclasts <lb/>in the knee joints from MBL −/− mice compared with those from <lb/>WT mice (Figure 3A). CTSK is a novel cysteine protease <lb/>previously reported to be predominantly expressed by <lb/>osteoclasts (22). Immunolocalization of CTSK revealed a <lb/>higher amount of CSTK-positive osteoclasts in the joint from <lb/>adjuvant-treated MBL −/− mice than that from WT controls <lb/>(Figure 3B). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), produced by osteoblasts, is <lb/>an essential regulator in osteoclast formation via inhibiting both <lb/>differentiation and function of osteoclasts (23). We observed <lb/>that OPG expression was significantly lower in MBL −/− <lb/>AIA mice than WT controls by the immunohistochemical <lb/>staining (Figure 3C). Besides, bone morphogenetic proteins <lb/>(BMPs, e.g., BMP2 and BMP4), potent mediators for osteoblast <lb/>differentiation (24), were strongly over-expressed in the tissues <lb/>from MBL −/− arthritis mice compared to those from WT <lb/>counterparts (Figures 3D,E). Moreover, the levels of serum <lb/>PINP, a biochemical marker of bone formation, was significantly <lb/>higher in MBL −/− mice with arthritis than WT counterparts <lb/>(Figure 3F). The adjuvant-treated MBL −/− mice also displayed <lb/>a markedly increase in the serum level of β-CTX, a marker <lb/>of bone resorption, compared to WT controls (Figure 3F). <lb/>Collectively, these data suggest that MBL may modulate <lb/>the osteoclast formation and activity in the pathogenesis of <lb/>inflammatory arthritis. <lb/>MBL Suppresses RANKL-Induced <lb/>Osteoclast Formation in vitro <lb/>We compared the osteoclast formation in bone marrow <lb/>cells from WT and MBL −/− mice. Upon cultivation with <lb/>M-CSF and RANKL, bone marrow cells from MBL −/− <lb/>mice more efficiently differentiated into mature TRAP-<lb/>positive multinucleated osteoclasts than those from WT <lb/>littermates (Supplementary Figure 1A). Consistently, osteoclast <lb/>cultures of MBL −/− mice displayed an elevated resorption <lb/>activity (Supplementary Figure 1B).

One of the three independent experiments is shown. <lb/>MBL treatment significantly reduced the number of TRAP-<lb/>positive multinucleated osteoclasts. Besides, MBL protein <lb/>inhibited the bone resorption ability of osteoclasts in a <lb/>dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Consistent with the <lb/>limitation of osteoclastogenesis, the expression levels of several <lb/>established osteoclast marker genes, including dendritic cell-<lb/>specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), CTSK and <lb/>calcitonin receptor (CTR), were sharply reduced upon MBL <lb/>administration (Figure 4C). Besides, MBL also showed an <lb/>inhibitory effect on the induction of c-fos and NFATc1, <lb/>two of the essential osteoclasts-specific transcription factors, <lb/>during RANKL-stimulated osteoclast formation (Figure 4D). <lb/>Western blot analysis further confirmed the reduced protein <lb/>level of osteoclast marker and transcription factors in MBL-<lb/>treatment group compared to the control group (Figure 4E). <lb/>Notably, the nuclear localizations of NFATc1 and c-fos are <lb/>essential for the osteoclast differentiation (3, 25). We performed <lb/>immunofluorescence staining assay to confirm whether MBL <lb/>inhibited the expressions and nuclear localizations of NFATc1 <lb/>and c-fos in the osteoclasts. The result showed that MBL <lb/>treatment significantly decreased the expressions and nuclear <lb/>accumulations of NFATc1 and c-fos in M-CSF and RANKL-<lb/>stimulated human monocytes (Figure 4F). MMPs are a large <lb/>group of enzymes responsible for matrix degradation (26). <lb/>Among the MMPs, MMP-9, uniquely expressed by osteoclasts <lb/>(27), play a crucial role in joint destruction of inflammatory <lb/>arthritis (26, 28). Additional study demonstrated that MBL <lb/>inhibited the expression of MMP-9 in differentiated human <lb/>osteoclasts (Figure 4G). Taken together, these data indicate that <lb/>MBL impairs osteoclast differentiation in vitro. <lb/>MBL Affects Osteoclastogenesis Through <lb/>Modulation of p38 Signaling Pathway <lb/>All the three MAPK family members (i.e., extracellular signal-<lb/>regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and <lb/>p38) are rapidly phosphorylated and activated following RANKL <lb/>stimulation of osteoclast precursor cells (29). Among them, <lb/>the role of p38 in osteoclast differentiation and function <lb/>was extensively investigated (25, 30). Inactivation of the p38 <lb/>signaling pathway completely blocked the induction of c-<lb/>fos and NFATc1 with concomitant inhibition of RANKL-<lb/>induced osteoclastogenesis (25). We, therefore, investigate <lb/>the activation of the p38 signaling pathway in RANKL-<lb/>induced osteoclast formation. Enhanced p38 phosphorylation <lb/>was observed in MBL −/− mice-derived osteoclasts compared <lb/>with WT controls (Supplementary Figure 2). Also, MBL protein <lb/>efficiently inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of p38 <lb/>in human osteoclast precursors (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, <lb/></body>

			<body>FIGURE 5 | MBL inhibits the osteoclast differentiation via downregulation of p38 signaling pathway. The monocytes were treated with RANKL (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF <lb/>(50 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of 20 µg/ml MBL protein for indicated time points. (A) The phosphorylated of p38 were determined by western blot analysis. <lb/>(B) The expression of NFATc1 and c-fos in cytosolic and nuclear fractions of the cells was evaluated by immunoblotting analysis. (C-E) Human monocytes were <lb/>cultured with RANKL (100 ng/mL), M-CSF (50 ng/mL) and MBL protein (20 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (50 nM) for 4 days. Then, <lb/>the protein levels of CTSK, NFATc1, and c-fos were evaluated by immunoblotting analysis (C). The mRNA levels of osteoclast-specific genes (DC-STAMP, CTSK, and <lb/>CTR) (D) and the novel transcription factors (NFATc1 and c-fos). (E) were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and expressed as a ratio to GAPDH. *p &lt; 0.05, <lb/>**p &lt; 0.01, NS, not significant. The data represent three independent experiments with similar results. <lb/>the subsequent nuclear translocations of NFATc1 and c-<lb/>fos were substantially limited in the presence of MBL <lb/>(Figure 5B). To further evaluate the effect of p38 activation <lb/>on MBL-mediated regulation of osteoclast differentiation, <lb/>osteoclast precursors were pre-treated with p38 inhibitor, <lb/>SB203580, before RANKL stimulation. The levels of osteoclast <lb/>markers and osteoclasts-specific transcription factors were <lb/>strongly reduced and comparable between RANKL-induced <lb/>osteoclast differentiations with or without MBL incubation upon <lb/>p38 blockade (Figures 5C-E). These results suggest that the <lb/>regulation by MBL of osteoclast differentiation is dependent on <lb/>the p38 signaling pathway. <lb/>The Correlation of Plasma MBL Levels <lb/>With Disease Severity and Osteoclast <lb/>Differentiation in Patients With <lb/>Inflammatory Arthritis <lb/>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by joint inflammation <lb/>and progressive joint damage, and bone destruction in RA is <lb/>mainly attributable to the abnormal activation of osteoclasts (1). <lb/>We, therefore, explored the role of MBL in the progression of RA <lb/>as well as the process of osteoclastogenesis. In line with previous <lb/>reports (12, 31), we found that the sera from RA patients showed <lb/>the MBL serum levels in these patients were significantly lower <lb/>than those in HCs (Figure 6A). We also analyzed the association <lb/>of MBL serum level with the disease activity. The results <lb/>showed that the serum level of MBL was negatively correlated <lb/>with rheumatoid factor (RF) (Figure 6B) and erythrocyte <lb/>sedimentation rate (ESR) (Figure 6C). Furthermore, MBL levels <lb/>were found to be negatively correlated with serum levels of <lb/>PINP and β-CTX in patients with RA (Figures 6D,E). These data <lb/>indicate that circulating levels of MBL was significantly associated <lb/>with the disease activity and osteoclastogenesis in patients with <lb/>inflammatory arthritis. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>MBL is a liver-derived circulating plasma protein, which usually <lb/>acts as an immunomodulator in the inflammatory response <lb/>during microbial infection and tissue regeneration (8, 9). It <lb/>has been reported that MBL deficiency is a significant risk <lb/>factor for inflammatory arthritis (12, 31). In the present study, <lb/>we demonstrated that MBL deficiency exacerbated adjuvant-<lb/>induced inflammatory arthritis in mice, which was associated <lb/>with a remarkable increase in the formation of osteoclasts. We <lb/>also assessed the effects of MBL protein on RANKL-induced <lb/>osteoclastogenesis in human monocytes. Our results indicated <lb/>that MBL inhibited the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by <lb/>attenuating the RANKL-mediated p38 pathway activation and <lb/>inhibiting the level of c-fos and NFATc1 transcription factors. <lb/>Furthermore, our data demonstrated a significant correlation <lb/></body>

(A) Comparison of serum MBL in healthy controls (HC) (n = <lb/>30) and arthritis patients (n = 34). (B,C) Correlation between serum MBL levels with arthritis serological parameters, RF (B) and ESR (C), in patients with arthritis. <lb/>(D-E) The relationship of serum MBL concentration with bone turnover biochemical markers, P1NP (D) and β-CTX (E), in patients with arthritis. <lb/>between the serum level of MBL and bone turnover markers (i.e., <lb/>PINP and β-CTX) in patients with arthritis. <lb/>Cartilage damage is a crucial feature of chronic inflammatory <lb/>joint diseases (32). Joint damage might result in the release of <lb/>extracellular matrix (ECM) components (e.g., fibromodulin <lb/>and aggrecan) into the synovial fluid, which can activate the <lb/>complement system and form membrane attack complex <lb/>(MAC) targeting chondrocytes and killing them to cause <lb/>cartilage damage, thereby continuing self-perpetuating cycle <lb/>of complement activation and cartilage damage. Wang <lb/>et al. (33) validated that the expression and activation of <lb/>complement are abnormally high in human arthritis joints <lb/>by proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of synovial fluids <lb/>and synovial membranes from subjects with arthritis. It <lb/>was thought that complement inhibition would be sufficient <lb/>to break the cycle of complement activation and cartilage <lb/>damage and consequent prevent inflammatory arthritis after <lb/>knee trauma. Indeed, the mice deficient for C3 or factor B <lb/>were highly resistant to experimental arthritis, indicating <lb/>that complement activation by both the classical and the <lb/>alternative pathway acts as a deleterious role in inflammatory <lb/>(34). Moreover, complement modulation by using C3aR <lb/>and C5aR antagonists and an anti-C5 blocking antibody <lb/>was found to be effective in animal studies by ameliorating <lb/>arthritis or even preventing the disease (35-37). Here, we <lb/>observed the adjuvant-treated MBL −/− mice exhibited <lb/>severe joint damage accompanied by the destruction of <lb/>joint cartilage and bone compared with WT counterparts, <lb/>indicating that MBL limits the pathogenesis and progression <lb/>of inflammatory arthritis. It is widely known that MBL-<lb/>initiated lectin pathway is one of the routes leading to <lb/>activate the complement cascade. Meanwhile, MBL also <lb/>performs a regulatory role in the immune system (10). <lb/>Therefore, we postulated that MBL might be critical in <lb/>the regulation of inflammatory responses rather than the <lb/>activation of the complement system in the pathogenesis of <lb/>inflammatory arthritis. <lb/>The effect of MBL on the protection of bone disruption <lb/>could also be manifested through regulating osteoclast formation. <lb/>As suggested by our data, MBL has potent activity in globally <lb/>reducing the expression of specific osteoclast markers in RANKL <lb/>and M-CSF treated cells, including TRAP, CTSK, CTR, as well <lb/>as the transcription factor NFATc1 and c-fos. It is noteworthy <lb/>to mention that osteoclast differentiation contributes to the <lb/>progressive joint destruction in patients with inflammatory <lb/>arthritis (4, 38). The involvement of MBL in the processes <lb/>of coagulation cascade initiation is extensive studied (10). <lb/>Notably, thrombin inhibits the early stages of RANKL-induced <lb/>osteoclast differentiation through a direct effect on osteoclast <lb/>precursors (39). Low MBL level caused by a genetic variation <lb/>has been reported to be disturbed the particular process during <lb/>bone healing (40). Herein, we provided the evidence for the <lb/>first time that MBL could inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclast <lb/>differentiation, which strongly expanded our understanding of <lb/>the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in patients with MBL <lb/>deficiency. Indeed, our and others&apos; previous reports showed that <lb/>MBL could modulate the differentiation and function of innate <lb/>immune cells (i.e., DCs, monocytes, T cells, and mesenchymal <lb/>cells) in different contexts (14-16, 41, 42). It could be concluded <lb/>that MBL balancing the differentiation and function of innate <lb/>immune cells plays an essential role in the maintenance of <lb/>tissue homeostasis. <lb/></body>

			<body>The earlier studies have shown that activation of the <lb/>p38-mediated pathway is indispensable during the osteoclast <lb/>formation and pharmacological inhibition of p38 activation <lb/>severely blunts osteoclastogenesis (43, 44). Importantly, p38 <lb/>has been reported to be crucial for the induction of c-fos and <lb/>NFATc1 during RANKL-induced osteoclast formation (25). In <lb/>the present study, we investigated the role of the p38 signaling <lb/>pathway in RANKL-treated precursors in the presence of MBL <lb/>protein, and have demonstrated that MBL has an inhibitory <lb/>effect on osteoclast differentiation via downregulation of the <lb/>p38/c-fos/NFATc1 signaling pathways. The result is consistent <lb/>with several other observations showing that the regulation <lb/>of monocytes activation and macrophage polarization by MBL <lb/>under the inflammatory condition was associated with repression <lb/>of p38 signaling pathway (45, 46). <lb/>Several previous studies reported that the MBL serum levels <lb/>are significantly reduced in RA patients compared to HC controls <lb/>(11, 12, 47, 48). A high fraction of RA patients lacked detectable <lb/>MBL in serum in a long term prospective study, indicating that <lb/>MBL insufficiency might be a contributing pathogenic factor in <lb/>RA (48). Low serum MBL was associated with raised RF levels, <lb/>which therefore could predict poor prognosis in patients with <lb/>early RA (11). A study about southern Chinese patients with <lb/>RA determined that a low serum MBL level predisposes to the <lb/>development of RA and is a risk factor for the development <lb/>of erosive arthritis (12). Another Brazilian study found that <lb/>circulating serum MBL levels are significantly lower in RA <lb/>patients compared to their relatives and controls (47). In contrast, <lb/>a study done by Saevarsdottir et al. (49) in Iceland showed that <lb/>patients with RA had strongly higher MBL levels than their close <lb/>relatives and unrelated controls. Conflicting reports on serum <lb/>MBL level and the risk of RA may, at least partially, be attributed <lb/>to the differences in patient cohorts. It is noteworthy that MBL <lb/>is an acute-phase protein which may transiently increase during <lb/>inflammatory responses. Indeed, a high serum level of MBL <lb/>was found to confer an increased risk of overall death and <lb/>cardiovascular death in RA patients indicating a dual function <lb/>of MBL in this rheumatic disease (50). <lb/>In summary, we demonstrate that MBL deficiency exacerbates <lb/>AIA through promoting osteoclast differentiation. Importantly, <lb/>our work elucidates an unknown feature of MBL function in <lb/>osteoclastogenesis, indicating the association of MBL with bone-<lb/>related diseases. Our study reveals a new mechanism underlying <lb/>the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in patients with MBL <lb/>deficiency and implicates that supplement of MBL may represent <lb/>a new strategy for the treatment of arthritis, especially in patients <lb/>with MBL deficiency. <lb/></body>
