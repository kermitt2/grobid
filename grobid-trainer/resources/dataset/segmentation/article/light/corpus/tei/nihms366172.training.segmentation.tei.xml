One hundred subjects (American <lb/>Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1-3) presenting for elective, outpatient surgery were <lb/>randomly assigned to 52 air-Q ® and 48 ProSeal devices. The primary study endpoint was airway <lb/>seal pressure. Oropharyngolaryngeal morbidity was assessed secondarily. Mean (SD) airway seal <lb/>pressures for the air-Q ® and ProSeal were 30 (7) cmH 2 O and 30 (6) cmH 2 O, respectively (p = <lb/>0.47). Postoperative sore throat was more common with the air-Q ® (46% vs 38%, p = 0.03) as was <lb/>pain on swallowing (30% vs 5%, p = 0.01). In conclusion, the air-Q ® performs well as a primary <lb/>airway during the maintenance of general anaesthesia with an airway seal pressure similar to that <lb/>of the ProSeal, but with a higher incidence of postoperative oropharyngolaryngeal complaints. <lb/></front>

			<body>The air-Q ® Intubating Laryngeal Airway (air-Q; Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL, USA) is <lb/>a new supraglottic airway device (SAD) intended for use as a primary airway as well as an <lb/>aid for tracheal intubation in situations of anticipated or unanticipated difficult airways. Its <lb/>design includes a large airway tube inner diameter (ID), a short airway tube length and a <lb/>tethered, removable standard 15-mm circuit adapter. These features enable direct insertion <lb/>of larger tracheal tubes (up to 7.5 and 8.5 mm IDs for air-Q sizes 3.5 and 4.5, respectively) <lb/>through the airway tube and reduce the tracheal tube length requirements imposed by some <lb/>SADs to ensure tracheal tube cuff placement below the level of the vocal cords [1]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Amongst current SADs, the LMA-ProSeal™ (LMA North America, San Diego, CA, USA) <lb/>has demonstrated its superior ability to seal the airway even under high pressure (~27-36 <lb/>cmH 2 O) [2], which allows it to be used reliably with or without positive pressure <lb/>ventilation. This seal is significantly higher than that reported for the LMA-Classic™ <lb/>(cLMA; LMA North America, San Diego, CA, USA), of ~16-22 cmH 2 O [2]. Nonetheless, <lb/>the cLMA has been reported to be an excellent conduit for fibreoptic-aided intubation [3, 4], <lb/>particularly by less experienced practitioners [5]. Because of the configuration of the airway <lb/>tube relative to the bowl of the mask of the ProSeal (slightly off to the right) and its smaller <lb/>airway tube ID compared with the cLMA, intubating directly or using a fibreoptic exchange <lb/>technique through the device may be more challenging and negate its potential advantage <lb/>with respect to lung ventilation [6]. <lb/>Data on use of the air-Q is currently limited. Paediatric case reports [7, 8], a prospective, <lb/>observational study in adults [9] and two prospective randomised trials comparing blind <lb/>intubation rates through the air-Q and other SADs comprise the literature [10, 11]. Two of <lb/>the studies used an earlier generation of the PVC-based, single-use device [9, 10] and only <lb/>one reported airway seal pressure achieved with the device [9]. Thus, our primary goal was <lb/>to compare the airway seal pressures (as a surrogate for efficacy of lung ventilation) of the <lb/>newest generation, silicone-based, reusable air-Q and the ProSeal in adults undergoing <lb/>general anaesthesia. We hypothesised that the seal of the air-Q would be commensurate with <lb/>other frequently used SADs, but not as good as the ProSeal, as our early experience, albeit <lb/>using the single-use device, suggested an airway seal pressure on the order of 25 cmH 2 O <lb/>[12]. Secondly, we sought to compare: overall insertion success; ease of insertion; <lb/>positioning of the device in relation to the vocal cords; haemodynamic effects after initial <lb/>placement; subjective ratings of overall clinical usefulness; and peri-operative <lb/>oropharyngolaryngeal morbidity, between the devices. <lb/>Methods <lb/>The University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved this <lb/>prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial. After written informed consent, patients <lb/>were randomly assigned by toss of a coin to receive either an air-Q or ProSeal. All patients ≥ <lb/>18 years of age, scheduled for elective outpatient surgery in which general anaesthesia with <lb/>the placement of a SAD was planned, were eligible. Patients with symptomatic or untreated <lb/>gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, prior oesophagectomy, hiatus hernia, vomiting within 24 <lb/>h of surgery, known oropharyngeal pathology making a proper SAD fit unlikely, or any <lb/>condition for which the primary anaesthesia team deemed intubation with a tracheal tube to <lb/>be necessary, were excluded. The study population did not result from screening all patients <lb/>presenting for outpatient surgery, but rather represents a sample taken from consecutive <lb/>screening on days when one of three investigators (REG, KMS and AMJ) was scheduled to <lb/>be in the outpatient surgery centre. <lb/>After intravenous access was established, patients were premedicated with 1-2 mg <lb/>midazolam at the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist and transported to the <lb/>operating room. Standard monitors, including pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, <lb/>capnography, non-invasive arterial blood pressure and inspired / expired multi-gas analysis, <lb/>were placed. Denitrogenation was accomplished by tidal breathing of 10 l.min −1 oxygen <lb/>100% for &gt; 3 min. General anaesthesia was induced intravenously with fentanyl (0-2 <lb/>µg.kg −1 ) and propofol (2-3 mg.kg −1 ) and maintained with 2-3% sevoflurane in 50% oxygen <lb/>delivered via a circle anaesthesia system. Neuromuscular blocking drugs were not used as <lb/>part of the induction, but only afterwards to facilitate surgical conditions at the discretion of <lb/>the primary anaesthesia providers. <lb/></body>

			<body>When the patient became unresponsive to a jaw thrust, the assigned device was placed. <lb/>Before placement, the devices were tested for leaks and lubricated on the tip and posterior <lb/>surface with water-soluble surgical gel. The use of viscous lidocaine and / or other topical <lb/>anaesthetics was not allowed. For patients assigned to the air-Q group, size 3.5 and 4.5 <lb/>devices were placed in women and men, respectively. Before insertion, just enough air was <lb/>withdrawn from the device to cause visible dimpling in the posterior portion of the cuff. The <lb/>device was then placed in the patient&apos;s mouth behind the tongue and the index finger of the <lb/>operator&apos;s left hand was used to guide the tip of the cuff around the base of the tongue. <lb/>Simultaneously, a caudad force was applied with the operator&apos;s right hand on the airway <lb/>tube and the device was rotated inwardly and forward into position. If initial resistance to <lb/>advancement was met, a jaw lift with the operator&apos;s left hand was performed, while the <lb/>device was rotated inwardly and forward into position with the right hand. When <lb/>advancement met a firm stop, the cuff was inflated with 15-20 ml air (15 ml for size 3.5 and <lb/>20 ml for size 4.5) in accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s labelled recommendation and <lb/>assessed for adequate ventilation, defined as measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide on the <lb/>anaesthesia monitor and observation of a rising chest with manual inflation using the <lb/>breathing bag of the anaesthesia circle system. Pressure manometer-guided cuff inflation <lb/>was not used for the air-Q as the manufacturer makes no recommendation for cuff inflation <lb/>pressure, but only a maximum cuff inflation volume. <lb/>For patients assigned to the ProSeal group, size 4 and 5 devices were placed in women and <lb/>men, respectively, using the unassisted, gum elastic bougie-guided insertion technique <lb/>described by Matioc et al. [13]. We used this technique as it represents an optimal first-<lb/>attempt insertion method for the ProSeal [14]. Accordingly, an appropriately sized ProSeal <lb/>was first loaded on to a lubricated, Portex 15-Fr, 60-cm coudetipped bougie (Smiths <lb/>Medical, Dublin, OH, USA), placed straight-end first into the proximal end of the gastric <lb/>drainage port until it extended approximately 20 cm from the distal edge of the device. After <lb/>the patient was unresponsive to a jaw thrust, a size 3 Macintosh laryngoscope was placed <lb/>gently into the mouth in order to assure that the tongue and hypopharyngeal tissues were <lb/>displaced anteriorly. No attempts were made to view the epiglottis or vocal cord apparatus. <lb/>With the ProSeal and bougie held as a unit in the dominant hand, the straight end of the <lb/>bougie protruding from the ProSeal was inserted into the oesophagus under direct vision. <lb/>The laryngoscope was then removed and the ProSeal was railroaded over the bougie into <lb/>position. Once in place, the bougie was removed. The ProSeal cuff was inflated to an intra-<lb/>cuff pressure of 60 cmH 2 O using a hand-held manometer and adequate ventilation was <lb/>assessed. <lb/>All devices were inserted by one of the primary investigators (REG and AMJ), both of <lb/>whom were equally experienced using both devices and insertion techniques. Insertion <lb/>success was defined as device placement with observation of adequate ventilation within <lb/>three attempts. One attempt was counted if the device had to be removed from the patient&apos;s <lb/>mouth during the insertion procedure. In the event of insertion failure, further airway <lb/>management was at the attending anaesthesiologist&apos;s discretion. Insertion time for the air-Q <lb/>was measured from when the investigator picked up the device after induction of anaesthesia <lb/>to confirmation of ventilation by end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing on the monitor. For the <lb/>ProSeal, the time was measured from when the investigator began to insert the blade of the <lb/>laryngoscope into the patient&apos;s mouth to confirmation of ventilation by end-tidal carbon <lb/>dioxide tracing on the monitor. <lb/>After device placement and confirmation of adequate ventilation, the airway seal pressure <lb/>was tested with the patient&apos;s head and neck in the neutral position by closing the expiratory <lb/>valve and setting the fresh gas flow to 5 l.min −1 ; airway seal pressure was taken as the <lb/>pressure at which the needle of the manometer attached to the anaesthesia circuit reached <lb/></body>

			<body>equilibration associated with an audible air leak from the oropharynx up to a maximum <lb/>pressure of 40 cmH 2 O. Gastric insufflation was assessed by auscultation over the epigastrum <lb/>during manual lung inflation and recorded as either present or not present. After devices <lb/>were in place, leak-tested and secured, an investigator placed a fibreoptic bronchoscope <lb/>(FB-15V, Pentax Medical, Montvale, NJ, USA) to the end of the airway tube and the <lb/>relationship of the bowl of the mask to the vocal cords was graded using the view at the <lb/>eyepiece as follows: 1 = full view of the vocal cords; 2 = partial view of the cords including <lb/>arytenoids; 3 = epiglottis only; or 4 = other (SAD cuff, pharynx, other) [4]. Systolic, <lb/>diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation by pulse <lb/>oximetry (SpO 2 ) were recorded before anaesthetic induction and at 1-min intervals over the <lb/>first 5 min after device placement. At the conclusion of the case, the airway device was <lb/>removed when the patient was awake enough to follow commands. The airway cuffs were <lb/>left inflated during removal. After removal, the device was examined for the presence of <lb/>grossly visible blood or bile. Its presence or absence was recorded and the severity of any <lb/>staining was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. In the recovery area, once the patient <lb/>was fully awake, the oropharynx was examined to assess for any injury. In addition, a <lb/>standardised questionnaire was administered before hospital discharge and by telephone <lb/>follow-up at 24 h to assess the frequency of oropharyngolaryngeal complaints. When <lb/>present, complaints were graded by the patient as mild, moderate, or severe. All study data <lb/>were recorded by one of the authors or a trained data collector. All patients remained <lb/>unaware of their study group assignment; however, the personnel performing the study <lb/>procedures and / or data collection, as well as the primary anaesthesia provider(s), were not <lb/>blinded. <lb/>Our study was powered for superiority of the ProSeal over the air-Q for the primary <lb/>outcome. Pilot data collected by the primary investigators (REG and AMJ) for the air-Q <lb/>showed a mean (SD) seal pressure of 25 (7) cmH 2 O, while the ProSeal is reported to be 30 <lb/>(8) cmH 2 O [2]. Considering a difference of 5 cmH 2 O to be the smallest clinically relevant <lb/>difference in airway seal pressure, we calculated a standardised difference (difference <lb/>divided by standard deviation) of 0.625 (5 / 8). Using the nomogram of Altman [15] for a <lb/>two-sample comparison of a continuous variable, relating standardised difference, power <lb/>and significance level, a total population size of 100 (50 patients per group) was determined <lb/>for our study to ensure 80% power with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 to detect a 20% difference <lb/>in airway seal pressures between the air-Q and ProSeal. Data analysis was performed on an <lb/>intent-to-treat basis. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.2. (SAS <lb/>Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) Fisher&apos;s exact testing was performed to analyse the study <lb/>primary and secondary endpoints. Generalised estimating equations were used in the <lb/>analysis of repeated measures. For all tests, statistical significance was defined as a p value <lb/>&lt; 0.05. <lb/>Results <lb/>One hundred and four patients were screened and approached for consent between 22 <lb/>October 2009 and 13 April 2010. Four patients declined participation. No patient withdrew <lb/>after enrolment. Fifty-two air-Qs and 48 ProSeal were placed. No differences in group <lb/>baseline characteristics were found (Table 1). <lb/>Table 2 summarises the devices&apos; size and performance characteristics. Devices were sized <lb/>according to protocol in all patients with exception to one female patient who received a size <lb/>3 ProSeal due to her smaller size. Mean (SD) airway seal pressures for the air-Q and the <lb/>ProSeal, were similar. There were no insertion or usage failures. Air-Q and pLMA insertion <lb/>was rated easy in 87% vs 98% and slightly difficult in 13% vs 2% insertions, respectively (p <lb/>= 0.067). Insertion time was shorter with the air-Q than with the ProSeal. Overall usefulness <lb/></body>

			<body>was rated excellent, good and fair 85%, 13% and 2% of the time when the air-Q was used <lb/>and 88%, 8% and 4% of the time when the ProSeal was used (p = 0.57). Overall duration of <lb/>use was similar. There were no differences in the fibreoptic view of the vocal cords. No <lb/>episodes of epigastric insufflation after placement of the device or the appearance of gross <lb/>bile after its removal were noted for either device. Gross blood was noted on 10 (19%) and 4 <lb/>(8%) air-Qs and ProSeals after removal, respectively (p = 0.15). One patient who received <lb/>an air-Q was found in the recovery area to have a lip abrasion. No oropharyngeal injuries <lb/>were found in the ProSeal group. <lb/>Haemodynamic and respiratory data at baseline and over the first 5 min after device <lb/>placement are shown in Fig. 1. No significant changes over time were observed for heart <lb/>rate and S p O 2 . In both the air-Q and the ProSeal groups, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial <lb/>blood pressures decreased over time (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, systolic, diastolic and mean <lb/>blood pressure values were significantly higher in the air-Q group compared to the ProSeal <lb/>group (p = 0.002, p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). <lb/>In the recovery area, more patients in the air-Q group reported sore throat (46% vs 38%, p = <lb/>0.03). At 24-h follow-up, more patients in the air-Q group reported pain on swallowing (p = <lb/>0.01), but not sore throat (30% vs 5%, p = 0.07). The occurrence of pain in the jaw or <lb/>mouth, pain on speaking, tongue swelling, tongue numbness, face numbness, lip numbness, <lb/>ear pain, hearing change and vomiting in the recovery area or at 24-h follow-up were similar <lb/>between devices. The presence of gross blood on the device at removal was significantly <lb/>associated with sore throat pain (p = 0.04) in the recovery area, but not at 24-h follow-up. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our main finding is that airway seal pressures of the air-Q and ProSeal were similar. We do <lb/>not believe a type-2 statistical error arose as, in a post hoc power analysis, our sample size <lb/>provided &gt; 95% power to detect a clinically relevant 5-cmH 2 O airway seal pressure <lb/>difference between the devices. In other respects, we found the air-Q to be a satisfactory <lb/>device, while providing a clear view of the vocal cords in 90% of patients, which should <lb/>have facilitated fibreopticguided tracheal tube placement through the device if necessary. <lb/>The ProSeal was chosen as the comparator for our study as clinical evidence has <lb/>demonstrated its ability to provide a superior airway seal pressure compared with other <lb/>currently available SADs [2]. Both air-Q and ProSeal are constructed from silicone, which <lb/>may conform to the supraglottic structures better than PVC, the material used for many <lb/>disposable SADs, which tend to have higher airway seal pressures. Design features unique <lb/>to the air-Q that are likely to improve its airway seal pressure include: (1) an anterior curve <lb/>of the airway tube that better approximates the upper oropharyngeal airway and may provide <lb/>a more stable end-to-end coupling with the glottis; (2) mask ridges that may improve the <lb/>transverse stability of the bowl and support the lateral cuff seal; and (3) a higher posterior <lb/>heel height, which may improve the seal at the base of the tongue. However, the mean <lb/>airway seal pressure for the reusable air-Q may actually be higher than we observed because <lb/>first, in order to avoid pulmonary complications, measurement was terminated if a pressure <lb/>of 40 cmH 2 O was reached. This occurred in seven (13.5%) and six (12.5%) patients <lb/>receiving air-Qs and ProSeals, respectively. Second, we chose to fill the air-Q cuff after <lb/>insertion with 15-20 ml air in accordance with the device labelling, which may have <lb/>resulted in over-inflation. Keller et al. previously demonstrated that over-inflation of the <lb/>cLMA results in a decline in airway seal pressure [16]. If this holds true for the air-Q, then <lb/>the mean airway seal pressure for the air-Q observed in this study may be an underestimate. <lb/></body>

			<body>Our findings that the air-Q was easy to insert are similar to those recently reported by <lb/>Bakker et al. using the earlier generation, PVC-based, single-use design in 59 generally <lb/>healthy patients undergoing elective surgery [9], and are in agreement with multiple other <lb/>reports in which a host of reusable and disposable laryngeal masks were used [17-28]. The <lb/>insertion success is likely to proceed from the commonality of techniques and general design <lb/>features of the air-Q and other SADs. <lb/>We did not assign insertion time as a primary endpoint as the additional steps required by <lb/>the gum elastic bougie-guided insertion technique used for ProSeal placement would bias <lb/>the results. We chose this technique to optimise placement of the control device as it <lb/>represented the standard insertion technique for both primary investigators placing the study <lb/>devices and has been reported to result more frequently in successful ProSeal placement on <lb/>the first attempt [14]. Notably, the mean (SD) time for ProSeal insertion and first attempt <lb/>success rate in our study are consistent with previously published results (25 (14) s vs 28 <lb/>(11) s and 100% vs 98%, respectively) [14] and supports our choice and performance for <lb/>placement of the control device. <lb/>More patients who received the air-Q reported throat compared with those receiving the <lb/>ProSeal. We suspect cuff over-inflation (discussed above) was a likely factor [29, 30]. <lb/>Mucosal injury occurring at air-Q insertion and / or removal may also be a contributing <lb/>factor. <lb/>Our choice of size of device for use in each patient deserves further mention. The air-Q sizes <lb/>(3.5 and 4.5) are intended to be intermediate to the familiar whole number sizes (3, 4 and 5) <lb/>of other adult-sized SADs, but there are differences in the size of the periglottic portion of <lb/>the mask and the bowl-to-mask ratio between the study devices (Fig. 2). We chose to follow <lb/>sex-based rather than weight-based sizing for both devices [31-33]. <lb/>Although we recorded the view of the glottic aperture, our study was not a comparison of <lb/>the air-Q and the ProSeal as conduits for fibreoptic intubation. Two recent investigations <lb/>have reported blind intubation success rates via the air-Q of up to approximately 77% with <lb/>overall success (including fibreoptic-assisted intubation) success rates of up to 99% [10, 11]. <lb/>This falls short of the blind and fibreoptic assisted intubation success rates via the LMA-<lb/>Fastrach™ reported in the same trials, so this is an aspect of performance that warrants <lb/>further study. <lb/></body>
