			<front>High Pressure Effects on Superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore Oxides AOs 2 O 6 (A=K, Rb, Cs) <lb/>Takaki MURAMATSU, Shigeki YONEZAWA, Yuji MURAOKA and Zenji HIROI <lb/>Institute for Solid States Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8581 <lb/>KEYWORDS: superconductivity, β-pyrochlore oxide, pressure, magnetization <lb/>*E-mail address: muramatu@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp <lb/></front>

			<body>Superconductivity in transition metal oxides (TMOs) has been one of exciting fields in <lb/>solid state physics due to its unconventional properties. Many superconductors in TMOs crystallize <lb/>in perovskite related structures. Recently, an exceptional TMO superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 was found <lb/>with T c = 1.0 K, which crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure. 1) The pyrochlore structure contains a <lb/>corner-sharing tetrahedral network made of transition metal cations called the pyrochlore lattice, and <lb/>is known as one of spin frustration systems in the case that the transition metal cation has a localized <lb/>moment with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors. Very recently, three related <lb/>compounds AOs 2 O 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) named the β-pyrochlore oxides were found, 2-4) which contain <lb/>the pyrochlore lattice made of Os atoms. They show superconductivity at T c = 9.6 K, 6.3 K and 3.3 <lb/>K, respectively. Particularly in KOs 2 O 6 the T c is almost one order higher than in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . The <lb/>mechanism of the superconductivity has been extensively studied and was suggested to be <lb/>unconventional. For example, a remarkably large upper critical field H c2 of 38 T exceeding Pauli&apos;s <lb/>limit was reported for KOs 2 O 6 . 5) Moreover, the µSR and NMR experiments suggested an anisotropic <lb/>order parameter. 6,7) On the other hand, there are a few reports which suggest conventional BCS <lb/>superconductivity for RbOs 2 O 6 . 8,9) <lb/>It is plausible to assume that the systematic change of T c in AOs 2 O 6 is due to the size <lb/>effect of alkaline metal ions. The lattice constant is almost proportional to the ionic radius of A ions, <lb/>and the T c increases with decreasing the lattice constant from Cs to K under a positive chemical <lb/>pressure. 4) This is in contrast to the case of conventional BCS superconductivity in a single-band <lb/>model, where the T c decreases under a positive pressure, because the density of state (DOS) <lb/>decreases with decreasing the lattice volume, as typically observed in alkali metal doped C 60 <lb/>superconductors A 3 C 60 . 10) This contrast may indicate the uniqueness of the superconductivity in <lb/>AOs 2 O 6 . Thus, it is interesting to examine physical pressure effects on T c . In this note, we report <lb/>diamagnetic measurements under pressures up to 1.2 GPa using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell <lb/>on the three compounds of AOs 2 O 6 . In the α-pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 the high <lb/></body>

			<body>pressure study revealed that T c increases from 1.0 K to 3.0 K at 2 GPa and then decreases to vanish <lb/>above 3 GPa. 11,12) In the case of RbOs 2 O 6 , Khasanov et al. reported a high pressure experiment in <lb/>which the T c increases monotonously up to 1.0 GPa with the initial slope of 0.90 K/GPa. 8) <lb/>Polycrystalline samples were prepared as reported previously. 2-4) They were nearly <lb/>single-phase, but with a small amount of OsO 2 or Os metal. Magnetic susceptibility was measured in <lb/>a Quantum Design MPMS. Quasi-hydrostatic pressures up to 1.2 GPa were produced by a <lb/>piston-cylinder type pressure cell which is made of hardened CuBe alloy. Daphne oil 7373 was used <lb/>as a pressure transmitting medium. The actual pressure was determined in each experiment by <lb/>measuring the superconducting transition temperature of Pb or Sn which was put into the pressure <lb/>medium together with a sample and placed about 2 cm away from the sample. <lb/>A typical temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for KOs 2 O 6 is shown in Fig.1. <lb/>In a field of 10 Oe after zero-field cooling, a large diamagnetic signal due to the shielding effect was <lb/>observed at 4 K in the whole pressure range. On heating, it disappears rapidly above 9 K. We <lb/>defined T c in two ways. One is the onset temperature where the magnetic susceptibility starts to <lb/>deviate from a background signal at high temperature. This temperature corresponds to the T c <lb/>determined by specific heat measurements or resistivity measurements on bulk samples at ambient <lb/>pressure in a zero magnetic field. The other characteristic temperature T c &apos; is determined to be the <lb/>temperature where the diamagnetic signal becomes 5% of the maximum shielding signal. <lb/>The pressure dependence of T c as well as T c &apos; is plotted in Fig.2. In RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 , <lb/>the T c increases almost linearly with increasing pressure in the whole pressure range examined. The <lb/>slope for RbOs 2 O 6 is 0.78 K/GPa, which is slightly smaller than the value reported by Khasanov. 8) In <lb/>remarkable contrast, the T c of KOs 2 O 6 exhibits a downturn with a maximum value of 10.0 K at 0.56 <lb/>GPa, and then decreases to 9.5 K at 1.20 GPa. In order to compare the three systems, the pressure <lb/>dependence of T c (P) normalized by the T c at ambient pressure (AP) is shown in Fig. 2(b). The initial <lb/>slope of {T c (P)/T c (AP)}/P is 0.20, 0.14 and 0.13 GPa -1 for A = Cs, Rb and K, respectively; the <lb/>largest for CsOs 2 O 6 with the largest unit cell volume and the lowest T c at AP. The initial increase of <lb/>T c by applying physical pressure commonly observed for the three compounds is consistent with the <lb/>trend by chemical pressure. This means that the lattice volume is the key parameter to determine the <lb/>T c of AOs 2 O 6 . The origin of the saturation and the following downturn in T c for KOs 2 O 6 is not clear <lb/>at the moment but may indicate that a fluctuation relevant to the superconductivity is enhanced at <lb/>certain pressure and suppressed of higher pressure. Further experiments at higher pressures are <lb/>necessary to discuss this issure in more detail and are in progress. <lb/>In conclusion, we measured the pressure dependence of magnetization up to 1.2 GPa in <lb/>order to deduce the pressure effect of T c in the three β-pyrochlore oxides. It is found that the initial <lb/>pressure dependence of T c is positive for all the compounds. Only KOs 2 O 6 exhibits a saturation in T c <lb/>at 0.56 GPa and the downturn at higher pressure. <lb/></body>
