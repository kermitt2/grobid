As distribution coe icients capture both thermodynamic e ects (the free energy of transfer <lb/>between phases) and chemical e ects (protonation state and tautomer e ects in aqueous solution), they <lb/>provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long <lb/>correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as <lb/>protein-ligand binding a inities. For the SAMPL challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which <lb/>participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coe icients to assess its potential as a new route for <lb/>the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically <lb/>performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was <lb/>suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water-<lb/>saturated octanol phases, since it has which has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid <lb/>structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution <lb/>coe icients for a set of druglike compounds at pH . .

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Rigorous assessment of the predictive performance of <lb/>physical models is critical in evaluating the current state <lb/>of physical modeling for drug discovery, assessing the po-<lb/>tential impact of current models in active drug discovery <lb/>projects, and identifying limits of the domain of applicability <lb/>that require new models or improved algorithms. Past itera-<lb/>tions of the SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of <lb/>Proteins and Ligands) experiment have demonstrated that <lb/>blind predictive challenges can expose weaknesses in com-<lb/>putational methods for predicting protein-ligand binding <lb/>a inities and poses, hydration free energies, and host-guest <lb/>binding a inities [ -]. In addition, these blind challenges <lb/>have contributed new, high-quality datasets to the commu-<lb/>nity that have enabled retrospective validation studies and <lb/></body>

			<body>data-based parameterization e orts to further advance the <lb/>current state of physical modeling. <lb/>By focusing community e ort on the prediction of hydra-<lb/>tion free energies in the first few iterations of this challenge, <lb/>the SAMPL experiments have now brought physical model-<lb/>ing approaches to the point where they can reliably identify <lb/>erroneous experimental data [ ]. While hydration free energy <lb/>exercises have shown their utility in improving the state of <lb/>physical modeling, they are laborious, require specialized <lb/>equipment no longer found in modern laboratories, are (at <lb/>least using traditional protocols) limited in dynamic range, <lb/>and are of questionable applicability in their ability to mimic <lb/>protein-to-solvent transfer. As a result, no experimental lab-<lb/>oratory has emerged to provide new hydration free energy <lb/>measurements to sustain this aspect of the SAMPL challenge. <lb/>We sought to replace this component of the SAMPL challenge <lb/>portfolio with a new physical property that was easy to mea-<lb/>sure, accessible to multiple laboratories, had a wide dynamic <lb/>range (in a free energy scale), and better mimicked physical <lb/>and chemical e ects relevant to protein-to-solvent transfer <lb/>free energies, but was still free of the conformational sam-<lb/>pling challenges protein-ligand binding a inities present. As <lb/>the measurement of partition and distribution coe icients <lb/>is now widespread in pharma (due to its relevance in opti-<lb/>mizing lipophilicity of small molecules), we posited that a <lb/>blind challenge centered around the prediction of distribu-<lb/>tion coe icients-which face many of the same physical and <lb/>chemical e ects (such as protonation state [ , ] and tau-<lb/>tomer issues [ ]) observed in protein-ligand binding-might <lb/>provide such a challenge. <lb/>While the measurement of octanol/water distribution coef-<lb/>ficients is commonplace (a <lb/>benchmark of structure-and <lb/>property-based log P prediction methods used , <lb/>exper-<lb/>imental measurements [ ]), a number of previously-reported <lb/>complications in the physical simulation of -octanol sug-<lb/>gested that this might be too complex for an initial distri-<lb/>bution coe icient challenge [ -], despite some recent re-<lb/>ports of success [ ]. In particular, water-saturated octanol <lb/>is very wet, containing ± mg water/g solution [ ], and <lb/>forms complex microclusters or inverse-micelles that create <lb/>a heterogeneous environment that persist for long simula-<lb/>tion times [ -]. For the inaugural distribution coe icient <lb/>challenge in SAMPL , we therefore chose to measure cyclo-<lb/>hexane/water distribution coe icients. The water content <lb/>of water-saturated cyclohexane is much lower than water-<lb/>saturated octanol-. mg water/g solution, approximately <lb/>times smaller [ -], and possesses no long-lived het-<lb/>erogeneous structure [ ]. <lb/>The number of freely available sources of cyclohexane-<lb/>water partition is very limited, and for the purpose of the <lb/>SAMPL distribution coe icient challenge[ ], blind data <lb/>was required. As part of an internship program at Genen-<lb/>tech arranged by the coauthors, the lead author was dis-<lb/>patched to work out modifications of a high-throughput <lb/>shake-flask protocol [ ] currently in use for octanol/water <lb/>distribution coe icient measurements. In particular, the <lb/>low dielectric constant of cyclohexane ( . <lb/>) compared <lb/>to -octanol ( . ) [ ] and cyclohexane&apos;s surprising ability <lb/>to dissolve laboratory consumables presented some unex-<lb/>pected challenges. In this report, we describe the modified <lb/>protocol that resulted, and provide suggestions on how it <lb/>can further be refined for future iterations of the distribution <lb/>coe icient challenge. Of lead-like molecules with diverse <lb/>functional groups selected for measurement, we report <lb/>log D measurements that passed quality controls that were <lb/>used in the SAMPL challenge. <lb/>To ensure the reported experimental dataset is useful in <lb/>assessing, falsifying, and improving computational physical <lb/>models of physical properties, we require a robust approach <lb/>to estimating the experimental error (uncertainty in exper-<lb/>imental measurements). We explored several procedures <lb/>for propagating known sources of error in the measurement <lb/>process into the final reported log distribution coe icients, <lb/>and report those e orts here. Our primary approach features <lb/>a parametric bootstrap, which allows the use of a physical <lb/>model of the data generating process to sample additional <lb/>realizations of the data, using distributions specified in the <lb/>model. These additional realizations are new data points, <lb/>over which estimates can be calculated. We compared this to <lb/>a nonparametric bootstrap, which can be useful if a physical <lb/>model can not be constructed. This method generates new <lb/>data points as well, but it constructs them from selection <lb/>with replacement from the existing data. We also calculated <lb/>the arithmetic mean and standard error of the measured <lb/>data. We hope that future e orts to measure cyclohexane-<lb/>water distribution coe icients can benefit from the model <lb/>we have developed, so that this work will also be useful for <lb/>future challenges. <lb/>All code used in the analysis, as well as raw and processed <lb/>data, can be found at https://github.com/choderalab/ <lb/>sampl5-experimental-logd-data. <lb/>Theory of distribution coe icients <lb/>The distribution coe icient, D, is a measure of preferential <lb/>distribution of a given compound (solute) between two im-<lb/>miscible solvents at a specified pH, usually specified as log D <lb/>in its base-logarithmic form, <lb/>log D pH <lb/>solvent /solvent = log 10 <lb/>[Solute] solvent , pH <lb/>[Solute] solvent , pH <lb/>. ( ) <lb/>Typically, one solvent is aqueous and bu ered at the spec-<lb/>ified pH (e.g. Tris pH . ), while the other is apolar (e.g. -<lb/>octanol). At the given pH, the solute may populate multiple <lb/>protonation or tautomeric states, but the total concentration <lb/>summed over all states is used in the calculation of concen-<lb/>trations in Equation ( ). The total salt concentration of the <lb/>aqueous phase can also play a role, in case salts can provide <lb/>stabilization of an ionic state of the ligand in the aqueous <lb/>phase [ ]. Because of this, care must be exercised when <lb/>comparing distribution coe icients obtained under di erent <lb/>experimental conditions. <lb/>For the SAMPL challenge, we concern ourselves with <lb/>the cyclohexane-water distribution coe icient, where <lb/>phosphate-bu ered saline (PBS) at pH . is used for the <lb/>aqueous phase: <lb/>log D pH . <lb/>chx/wat = log 10 <lb/>[Solute] cyclohexane <lb/>[Solute] PBS, pH . <lb/>. <lb/>( ) <lb/>Another commonly reported value is the partition coe icient <lb/>P , which quantifies the relative concentration of the neutral <lb/>species in each phase, again usually specified in log 10 form, <lb/>log P chx/wat = log 10 <lb/>[Solute] <lb/>neutral <lb/>cyclohexane <lb/>[Solute] <lb/>neutral <lb/>PBS, pH . <lb/>. <lb/>( ) <lb/>For ligands with a single titratable site and known pK a , one <lb/>can readily convert between log P and log D for a given pH <lb/>(see, e.g. [ ]), but ligands with more complex protonation <lb/>state e ects or tautomeric state e ects make accounting for <lb/>the transfer free energies of all species significantly more <lb/>challenging. <lb/>II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS <lb/>In the following sections we describe how we measured <lb/>cyclohexane/water distribution coe icients for the com-<lb/>pounds displayed in Figure . The compound selection pro-<lb/>cedure is described in Section II A. <lb/>Distribution coe icient measurements utilized a shake-<lb/>flask approach based on a LC-MS/MS technique previously <lb/>developed for -octanol/water distribution coe icient mea-<lb/>surements [ ]. The approach is described in Section II B, <lb/>and the procedure is schematically summarized in Figure . <lb/>The measured data was subjected to a quality control pro-<lb/>cedure that eliminated measurements thought to be too <lb/>unreliable for use in the SAMPL challenge (Section II C). Re-<lb/>maining data were analyzed using a physical model of the <lb/>experiment by means of a parametric bootstrap procedure. <lb/>We compared this approach to a nonparametric bootstrap <lb/>approach, and the arithmetic mean and standard error of the <lb/>data without bootstrap analysis. In Section II D, we describe <lb/>each approach. The results for each approach can be found <lb/>in Table I. <lb/>A. Compound selection <lb/>Compounds were initially selected from a database of <lb/>lead-like molecules available in eMolecules that were <lb/>present in the Genentech chemical stores in quantities of <lb/>over mg, with molecular weights between <lb/>-<lb/>Da. The <lb/>lower bound on molecular weight was chosen to increase <lb/>the likelihood of detectability by mass spectrometry, and the <lb/>upper bound to limit molecular complexity. <lb/>We initially chose approximately compounds based on <lb/>several criteria: <lb/>• First, we selected carboxylic acid compounds. These <lb/>were of potential interest for the purpose of the chal-<lb/>lenge, since it was suspected these could potentially <lb/>partition along into the cyclohexane phase together <lb/>with water or cations [ ]. <lb/>• MoKa . was used to calculate cLogP, cLogD, and <lb/>pKa values [ , ]. This version of MoKa was trained <lb/>with Roche internal data to improve accuracy. We se-<lb/>lected compounds with predicted pKa values that <lb/>would potentially be measurable with a Sirius T in-<lb/>strument (Sirius Analytical) so validation with an or-<lb/>thogonal technique (electrochemical titration) could <lb/>be performed in the future. <lb/>• The remaining compounds were divided into equal-<lb/>size bins that spanned the predicted dynamic range <lb/>of log P values (-. to . ), and compounds were <lb/>drawn from each bin, to a total of . <lb/>This set of total was later reduced to due to the un-<lb/>availability of some compounds or the inability to detect <lb/>molecular fragments by mass spectrometry at the time of <lb/>measurement. This selection was expanded to include <lb/>compounds used as internal standards for the previously de-<lb/>veloped octanol/water assay protocol [ ], bringing the total <lb/>number of compounds for which measurements were per-<lb/>formed to . These compounds were randomly assigned nu-<lb/>merical SAMPL_XXX designations for the SAMPL blind chal-<lb/>lenge. A er the quality control filtering phase (Section II C), <lb/>the resulting data set contained compounds, which are <lb/>displayed in Figure . Canonical isomeric SMILES represen-<lb/>tations for the compounds can also be found in Table S . <lb/>These were generated using OpenEye Toolkits v <lb/>.June by <lb/>converting D SDF files, a er manually verifying the correct <lb/>stereochemistry. <lb/>B. Shake-flask measurement protocol for <lb/>cyclohexane/water distribution coe icients <lb/>We adapted a shake-flask assay method from an original <lb/>octanol/water LC-MS/MS protocol [ ] to accommodate the <lb/>use of cyclohexane for the nonaqueous phase. Our modified <lb/>protocol is described here, and the procedure is explained <lb/>schematically in Figure . <lb/>The log D is estimated by quantifying the concentration <lb/>of a solute directly from two immiscible layers, present as an <lb/>emulsion in a single vial. Capped glass . mL auto-injector <lb/>vials with PTFE-coated silicone septa were used for parti-<lb/>tioning, as cyclohexane was found to dissolve polystyrene <lb/>-well plates used in the original protocol. <lb/>For each individual experiment, µL of m compound <lb/>in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and µL of <lb/>µ propanolol <lb/>in acetonitrile (an internal standard) were added to <lb/>µL cy-<lb/>clohexane , followed by the addition of <lb/>µL of phosphate <lb/>bu ered saline (PBS) solution . The ionic components of the <lb/>bu er were chosen to replicate the bu er conditions used <lb/>in other in-vitro assays at Genentech. Unlike the original <lb/>protocol, neither phase was presaturated prior to pipetting. <lb/>The solute was allowed to partition between solvents <lb/>while the mixture was shaken for minutes using a plate <lb/>shaker at <lb/>RPM, while the vials were mounted in a vial <lb/>holder and taped down to the sides of the vial holder . The <lb/>two solvents were then separated by centrifugation for min-<lb/>utes at <lb/>RPM in a plate centrifuge, using the plate rotor , <lb/>with the vials seated in the same vial holder. <lb/>Aliquots were extracted from each separated phase using <lb/>a standard adjustable micropipette, and transferred into a <lb/>-well glass-coated polypropylene plate for subsequent <lb/>quantification . Cylcohexane wells were first prepared with <lb/>µL of -octanol per well. µL of cyclohexane was ex-<lb/></body>

			<body>tracted from the top phase by micropipette and mixed with <lb/>µL of octanol in the <lb/>well plate. <lb/>µL of aqueous so-<lb/>lution was subsequently extracted from the bottom phase. <lb/>The octanol dilution was performed mainly to prevent ac-<lb/>cumulation of cyclohexane on the C HPLC columns that <lb/>were used. For the aqueous (bottom) phase, the aliquot of <lb/>µL was transferred directly into the <lb/>-well plate, into <lb/>wells that did not contain octanol. The <lb/>-well plates were <lb/>sealed with using glueless aluminum foil seals , and frag-<lb/>ment concentrations assayed using quantitative LC-MS/MS. <lb/>Measuring solute distribution into the two phases depends <lb/>on two separate mass spectrometry measurements : <lb/>• The solute is analyzed to identify and select parent <lb/>and daughter ions, and optimize ion fragment param-<lb/>eters . <lb/>We used a flow rate of . mL/min, mobile phase of <lb/>water/acetonitrile/formic acid ( / / . v/v/v) and <lb/>. minutes run time. All parameters were automati-<lb/>cally stored for further MRM analyses. For several com-<lb/>pounds, the fragment identification LC-MS/MS proce-<lb/>dure did not yield high intensity fragments, and these <lb/>could therefore not be measured using the MRM ap-<lb/>proach. <lb/>• A separate mass spectrometer is employed using <lb/>multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) to select for par-<lb/>ent ions and daughter ions of the solute identified in <lb/>the previous step. The mass/charge (m/z) intensity <lb/>(proportional to the absolute number of molecules) is <lb/>quantified as a function of the retention time . Infor-<lb/>mation on the gradient can be found in Supplementary <lb/>Table of Lin and Pease <lb/>[ ]. <lb/>Highest m/z intensity fragments were selected using m <lb/>solutions consisting of % DMSO, % acetonitrile. <lb/>From each solvent phase in the partitioning experiment, <lb/>one aliquot was prepared, and replicate MRM measurements <lb/>were performed times per aliquot.

			<body>The cyclohexane signal is normalized by the dilution fac-<lb/>tor of our cyclohexane aliquots, d chx = 0.1, and the injec-<lb/>tion volume v inj, chx . As the PBS aliquots were not diluted, <lb/>this is only normalized by the injection volume v inj, PBS . Ex-<lb/>periments were carried out independently at least in dupli-<lb/>cate, repeated from the same DMSO stock solutions. In-<lb/>jection volumes of the MRM procedure were µL for cy-<lb/>clohexane (diluted in octanol), and µL for PBS samples. <lb/>For one set of measurements, we carried out additional <lb/>repeat experiments with µL injections for cyclohexane <lb/>(diluted in octanol), and µL for PBS. This set included <lb/>SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ , <lb/>SAMPL _ , SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ <lb/>, <lb/>SAMPL _ <lb/>, SAMPL _ <lb/>, and SAMPL _ . <lb/>C. Quality control <lb/>In order to eliminate measurements thought to be too <lb/>unreliable for the SAMPL challenge, we utilized a simple <lb/>quality control filter a er MRM quantification. Compounds <lb/>where the integrated MRM signal within either phase var-<lb/>ied between replicates or repeats by more than a factor of <lb/>were excluded from further analysis. We additionally re-<lb/>moved compounds that exceeded the dynamic range of the <lb/>assay because they did not produce a detectable MRM sig-<lb/>nal in either the cyclohexane or bu er phases during the <lb/>quantification. <lb/>D. Bootstrap analysis <lb/>Since our ultimate goal is to compare predicted distribu-<lb/>tion coe icients to experiment to evaluate the accuracy of <lb/>current-generation physical modeling approaches, it is crit-<lb/>ical to have an accurate assessment of the uncertainty in <lb/>the experimental measurement. Good approaches to uncer-<lb/>tainty analysis propagate all known sources of experimental <lb/>error into the final estimates of uncertainty. To accomplish <lb/>this, we developed a parametric bootstrap model [ ] of <lb/>the experiment based on earlier work [ ], with the goal of <lb/>propagating pipetting volume and technical replicate errors <lb/>through the complex analysis procedure to estimate their <lb/>impact on the overall estimated log D measurements. <lb/>Bootstrap approaches provide new synthetic data sets, <lb/>denoted as realizations, sampled using some function of <lb/>the observed data that approximates the distribution that <lb/>the observed data was drawn from. For each compound <lb/>that was measured, suppose our data set provides N inde-<lb/>pendent repeats (from the same stock solution, typically <lb/>or ), and technical replicates for each repeat (quantita-<lb/>tion experiments from each repeat, typically ). Each real-<lb/>ization of the bootstrap process leads to a new synthetic <lb/>data set, of the same size, from which a set of synthetic dis-<lb/>tribution coe icients can be computed for the realization. <lb/>We applied two additional approaches for comparison to <lb/>assess the performance of our parametric bootstrap method <lb/>(Section II D ). One features a nonparametric bootstrap ap-<lb/>proach (Section II D ), which does not include any physical <lb/>details. The other is a calculation of the arithmetic mean <lb/>and standard error that is limited to the observed data (Sec-<lb/>tion II D ). <lb/>. Parametric bootstrap <lb/>We used a parametric bootstrap [ ] method to introduce <lb/>a random bias and variance into the data, based on known <lb/>experimental sources. This procedure allows us to use a <lb/>model to propagate known uncertainty throughout the pro-<lb/>cedure [ ]. This allows us to better estimate the distribution <lb/>that the observed data was drawn from, so that more accu-<lb/>rate estimates of the means and sample variance can be <lb/>obtained. <lb/>Uncertainties in pipetting operations were modeled based <lb/>on manufacturer descriptions [ , ], following the work of <lb/>Hanson, Ekins and Chodera [ ]. Technical replicate varia-<lb/>tion was modeled by calculating the coe icient of variation <lb/>(CV) between individual experimental replicates. We then <lb/>took the mean CV of the entire data set, which was found <lb/>to be ∼ . . As a control, we verified that the CV did not de-<lb/>pend on the solvent phase that was measured. We included <lb/>this in the parametric model by adding a signal imprecision, <lb/>modeled by a normal distribution with zero mean, and a stan-<lb/>dard deviation of . . We perform a total of <lb/>realizations <lb/>of this process, and calculate statistics over all realizations, <lb/>such as the mean (expectation) and standard deviation (esti-<lb/>mate of standard error) for each measurement. <lb/>. Nonparameteric bootstrap <lb/>A traditional nonparametric Monte Carlo procedure was <lb/>applied to resample data points[ ]. This approach can es-<lb/>timate the distribution that the observed data was drawn <lb/>from by resampling from the observed data with replace-<lb/>ment, to generate a new set of data points with size equal <lb/>to the observed data set. Nonparametric bootstrap can be a <lb/>useful approach if larger amounts of data are available, and <lb/>a detailed physical model of the experiment is absent. We <lb/>implemented the procedure in two stages: <lb/>. A set of N repeats is drawn with replacement from the <lb/>original set of measured repeats. <lb/>. For each of the repeats, we similarly draw a set of <lb/>technical replicates from the original set of technical <lb/>replicates. <lb/>This yields a sample data set with the same size as the origi-<lb/>nally observed data (N repeats, with replicates each). We <lb/>perform a total of <lb/>realizations of this process, and calcu-<lb/>late statistics over all realizations, such as the mean (expec-<lb/>tation) and standard deviation (estimate of standard error) <lb/>for each measurement. <lb/>. Arithmetic mean and sample variance <lb/>We calculated the arithmetic mean over all replicates and <lb/>repeats, and estimated the standard error from the total of <lb/>or data points, to compare to our bootstrap estimates. <lb/>E. Kernel densities <lb/>As a visual guide, in Figure data are plotted on top of an <lb/>estimated density of points. This density was calculated us-<lb/>ing kernel density estimation [ ], which is a nonparametric <lb/>way to estimate a distribution of points using kernel func-<lb/>tions. Kernel functions assign density to individual points in <lb/>a data set, so that the combined set of data points reflects <lb/>a distribution of of the data. We used the implementation <lb/>available in seaborn . . [ ]. We used a product of Gaus-<lb/>sian kernels, with a bandwidth of . for log D and . for the <lb/>standard error. To prevent artifacts such as negative density <lb/>estimates for the standard errors, they were first transformed <lb/>by the natural logarithm ln, and the results were then con-<lb/>verted back into standard errors by exponentiation. <lb/>III. DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENTS <lb/>The log D values and their uncertainties for the small <lb/>molecules that passed quality controls are presented in Ta-<lb/>ble I. In the following two sections, we describe the di er-<lb/>ences between the analysis results in more detail. <lb/>A. Mean and standard errors in log D <lb/>The results from the arithmetic mean and sample variance <lb/>calculation ( Section II D ) are plotted in Figure c. <lb/>Despite the compound selection e ort, the distribution <lb/>of data along the log D-axis is less dense in the region -to <lb/>log units. The data outside this region seems to be cen-<lb/>tered around -log units, or around log unit. We could <lb/>attribute this distribution of data to coincidence, though this <lb/>way warrant future investigations into systematic errors. Us-<lb/>ing the arithmetic mean of the combined repeat and replicate <lb/>measurements (Section II D ) the distribution coe icients <lb/>measured spanned from -. to . log units. <lb/>The log D measurements distribution appears bimodal <lb/>along the uncertainty axis. A subset of mostly negative log D <lb/>values (Figure c) has a smaller estimated standard deviation, <lb/>though this is not the case for the majority of negative log D <lb/>values. The average standard error, rounded to significant <lb/>figure, is . log units for the arithmetic mean calculation. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">For the purpose of the D R/SAMPL workshop, we originally erroneously <lb/>reported the standard deviation • <lb/>√ <lb/>3 instead of the standard error • <lb/>√ <lb/>3. <lb/>The factor of <lb/>√ <lb/>3 corrects the sample standard deviation across all MRM <lb/>measurements for the correlation between the replicate measurements <lb/>belonging to a single independent experimental repeat. <lb/></note>

			<body>B. Bootstrap results <lb/>Estimates of the log D span the range between -. to . <lb/>log units, using either of the two bootstrap approaches (Sec-<lb/>tion II D and Section II D ). The log D estimates do not di er <lb/>significantly from the arithmetic mean calculations. The dif-<lb/>ference between the results is seen when we compare the <lb/>estimated standard errors. When applying our bootstrap pro-<lb/>cedures (Section II D and Section II D ), we see an upwards <lb/>shi in the uncertainties, compared to the sample variance <lb/>calculations. The nonparametric approach yields an aver-<lb/>age uncertainty of . log units. The parametric approach <lb/>yields an average uncertainty of . log units. The parametric <lb/>bootstrap suggests that by propagating errors such as the <lb/>cyclohexane dilution, and the replicate variability into the <lb/>model, some of the observed low uncertainties might be an <lb/>artifact of the low number of measurements. This suggest <lb/>that simply calculating the arithmetic mean, and standard er-<lb/>ror of all measured data might not reliably capture the error <lb/>in the experiments. We also note that for certain compounds, <lb/>bootstrap distributions exhibit multimodal character and <lb/>as such, standard errors might not accurately capture the <lb/>full extent of the experimental uncertainty. We provide the <lb/>bootstrap sample distributions of the parametric model in <lb/>the supplementary information. <lb/>Using the parametric scheme, we see an average shi of un-<lb/>certainties to larger values compared to the nonparametric <lb/>bootstrap. The density estimate suggests we should expect a <lb/>lower bound to the error that we have now incorporated into <lb/>the analysis. Not every compound shows the same increase <lb/>in uncertainty, though if we compare the two bootstrap ap-<lb/>proaches, results are similar above this empirically observed <lb/>lower bound. The nonparametric approach returns higher <lb/>uncertainties for some data on average, but estimates lower <lb/>uncertainties for some as well. It can be concluded that the <lb/>error would typically be underestimated without the use of <lb/>a bootstrap approach. Without a physical model, a nonpara-<lb/>metric approach might still underestimate errors due to the <lb/>limited sample size for each measurement (either or fully <lb/>independent repeats, and a total of replicates per data <lb/>point). <lb/>IV. DISCUSSION <lb/>. Solvent conditions <lb/>It is important to consider the fact that di erent cosolvents <lb/>may have on the measured values. The solutions contained <lb/>approximately % DMSO, as well as approximately . % ace-<lb/>tonitrile. Further work would benefit from a comparison with <lb/>experiments starting from dry stocks, and thereby not adding <lb/>extra solvents. This would eliminate DMSO and acetonitrile, <lb/>by dispensing compound directly into either cyclohexane, or <lb/>the mixture of cyclohexane and PBS. In this case, care should <lb/>be taken that all compound is dissolved. If found to be nec-<lb/>essary, we could then consider starting all experiments from <lb/>dry compound stocks, to entirely eliminate e ects from co-<lb/>solvents such as DMSO and acetonitrile. This would make <lb/>experiments much more laborious, and would therefore re-<lb/>duce the bandwidth of the method. <lb/>One of the things we could not completely account for in <lb/>the model was the exact ratio of cyclohexane and PBS so-<lb/>lution. We attempted to account for volumetric errors from <lb/>pipetting by performing independent repeat experiments, <lb/>although this may still leave some systematic error. Cyclo-<lb/>hexane is also a volatile compound, especialy compared to <lb/>water. For comparison, the vapor pressure of cyclohexane <lb/>is . torr [ ], versus . torr for water [ ]. It is possible <lb/>that evaporation may occur, which could lead to a systematic <lb/>overestimation of the cyclohexane volume. For future inves-<lb/>tigations, it may be fruitful to study the evaporation so that <lb/>this can be accounted for in the model of the experiment, <lb/>and to take note of systematic bias in the pipette models <lb/>used. <lb/>. Compound detection limits <lb/>Calculations using COSMO-RS so ware[ ] suggested a <lb/>systematic underestimation of log D values in the negative <lb/>log unit range, in particularly past a log D of -. Without <lb/>further experimental investigation, we can not draw definite <lb/>conclusions as to whether this is the case, or if so, where the <lb/>source of the systematic error lies. <lb/>One possibility that may cause an artificial reduction of <lb/>the dynamic range-especially at high log D values-is the <lb/>potential for MS/MS detector saturation at high ligand con-<lb/>centrations. Previous work (Figure from [ ]) examined <lb/>detector saturation e ects, finding it possible to reach suf-<lb/>ficiently high compound concentrations (generally ≥ µ ) <lb/>that MRM is no longer linear in compound concentration for <lb/>that phase. This work also found that di erent compounds <lb/>reach detector saturation at di erent concentrations [ ], in <lb/>principle requiring an assessment of detector saturation to <lb/>be performed for each compound. While we could not de-<lb/>duce obvious signs of detector saturation in our LC-MS/MS <lb/>chromatograms, these e ects could be mitigated by perform-<lb/>ing a dilution series of the aliquots sampled from each phase <lb/>of the partitioning experiment to ensure detector response <lb/>is linear in the range of dilutions measured. This may also re-<lb/>veal whether compound dimerization may be a complicating <lb/>factor in quantitation. <lb/>. Experimental design considerations <lb/>
			In order to adjust our experimental setup, we had to switch <lb/>away from using polystyrene well plates, as these were <lb/>dissolved by cyclohexane. We attempted the use of glass <lb/>inserts, and glass tubes but these were too narrow and pro-<lb/>vided insu icient mixing when shaken. We switched to glass <lb/>vials because their larger diameter provides improved mix-<lb/>ing when shaken. For future work, we would recommend <lb/>the use of glass coated plates, which have the automation <lb/>advantages of the plates used in the original protocol [ ]. <lb/>Plate seals need to be selected carefully. We experimented <lb/>with silicone sealing mats, but these absorbed significant <lb/>quantities of cyclohexane. We also had to discontinue use of <lb/>aluminum seals that contained glue, since the glue is soluble <lb/>in cyclohexane and would contaminate LC-MS/MS measure-<lb/>ments. In the end, we used aluminum PlateLoc heat seals <lb/>and glass coated <lb/>well plates to circumvent these issues. <lb/>Sensitivity also su ered due to the need to dilute cyclohex-<lb/>ane in octanol to prevent its accumulation on C columns <lb/>used in the LC-MS/MS phase of the experiment. Trial injec-<lb/>tions on a separate system and chromatograms showed ac-<lb/>cumulation of unknown origin at the end of each UV chro-<lb/>matogram. Accumulation was reduced by injecting less cy-<lb/>clohexane. As a result, we diluted the cyclohexane with -<lb/>octanol for the experiments described here, and ran blank <lb/>injections containing ethanol between batches of <lb/>mea-<lb/>surements to ensure the column was clean. <lb/>Another change to the protocol that we would like to con-<lb/>sider for future measurements is to optimize the time spent <lb/>equilibrating the mixture. In this work, we separated phases <lb/>via centrifugation and sampled aliquots for concentration <lb/>measurement within minutes. The post-centrifugation time <lb/>prior to sampling aliquots could be extend to <lb/>hours to <lb/>allow for more equilibration for the solute between phases. <lb/>This may have a downside, since we would have to consider <lb/>the e ects that may follow if compounds prefer to be in the <lb/>interface-region between cyclohexane and water, or water <lb/>and air. These could cause high local concentrations, intro-<lb/>ducing a dependency of the results on exactly which part of <lb/>the solution aliquots are taken from. We can get around this <lb/>by only taking samples from the pure cyclohexane and aque-<lb/>ous regions, avoiding the interfaces. This way, we still get the <lb/>right distribution coe icients for partitioning between bulk <lb/>phases even if some compound is lost to the interfaces. <lb/>It may be worthwhile to consider other e ects of pipetting <lb/>operations on the procedure. Some compounds could poten-<lb/>tially stick to the surface of pipettes, or glass surfaces. This <lb/>could adversely a ect our measurements by changing local <lb/>concentrations. <lb/>We also consider that assay results might be less variable if <lb/>we presaturated water and cyclohexane before mixing them. <lb/>While cyclohexane and water have much lower mutual sol-<lb/>ubility than octanol, it is still possible that this a ects the <lb/>measurement. <lb/>The computational end of the challenge featured some <lb/>di iculties with respect to interpretation of the data. This <lb/>was mainly because we could not separate out many e ects <lb/>from the data that could a ect the interpretation. We ob-<lb/>served that for the many e ects used to explain discrepan-<lb/>cies between model and experiment, none of those could <lb/>easily be tested with the current state of the data set. It may <lb/>be possible to discombobulate matters such as compound <lb/>dimerization, the transfer of water or ions into the cyclohex-<lb/>ane phase, from changes in the log D values based on the <lb/>molecular properties itself. <lb/>For future challenges, we would recommend that these <lb/>assays are carried out at multiple final concentrations of <lb/>the ligand in the assay. This could be achieved using di er-<lb/>ent volumes of m ligand stocks. This would help detect <lb/>dimerization issues, and may help account for issues with <lb/>detector oversaturation. Note that the absolute errors in <lb/>these stock volumes will not be critical, since the measure-<lb/>ments rely on the relative measurement between the two <lb/>phases. We could build models that allow for extrapolation <lb/>to the infinite dilution limit, which should then provide sim-<lb/>pler test cases for challenge participants to reproduce. On <lb/>the opposite end, it may be useful to even investigate ways <lb/>to design an experimental set that represents these type of <lb/>issues, such as compound dimerization, so that we can focus <lb/>more on these. <lb/>. Uncertainty analysis <lb/>We hope the experience from this challenges will lay the <lb/>groundwork for improving the reliability of data sets regard-<lb/>ing the physical properties that we as a modeling commu-<lb/>nity rely on. Many computational studies are limited in the <lb/>amount of high-quality experimental data that they have ac-<lb/>cess to. Unfortunately, most data is taken straight from liter-<lb/>ature tables, without much thought being spent on the data <lb/>collection process. By performing the experimental part of <lb/>the SAMPL challenge we were in the position to provide new <lb/>data to the modeling community, with an opportunity to de-<lb/>cide on an analysis strategy that suits modeling applications. <lb/>This not only allows for blind validation of physics-based <lb/>models, but also a re-evaluation of the exact properties a <lb/>data set should have to provide utility to the modeling com-<lb/>munity. An important fact that we feel needs reemphasizing <lb/>is that experimental data is limited in utility by the method <lb/>that was used to analyze it. <lb/>Among the lessons learned from this challenge, we would <lb/>recommend that future challenges would also feature a rig-<lb/>orous statistical treatment of the experimental analysis pro-<lb/>cedure, ideally going beyond these initial e orts. One crucial <lb/>part of the analysis procedure is obtaining not only accu-<lb/>rate estimates of the observable, but also its uncertainty. <lb/>As indicated in our data set, standard error estimates from <lb/>small populations may underestimate the error. Several ap-<lb/>proaches can be taken to resolve part of this issue. Among the <lb/>options are the use of statistical tests, such as the bootstrap-<lb/>ping methods we applied in this work. These can help us both <lb/>propagate information on uncertainty into the model (such <lb/>as a parametric bootstrap) or extract uncertainty already <lb/>available in the data (such as nonparametric bootstrap). The <lb/>parametric approaches can be improved in terms of the phys-<lb/>ical models that are used to analyze the data. These models <lb/>should ideally include all known sources of error, such as <lb/>pipetting errors, evaporation of solvent, errors in integration <lb/>so ware, fluctuations in temperature, pressure and likewise <lb/>many other conditions that could a ect the results. <lb/>Another approach would be to perform statistical infer-<lb/>ence on the data set, to provide uncertainty estimates from <lb/>the data itself. The model structure can provide ways to <lb/>incorporate data and propagate uncertainty from multiple <lb/>experiments. Common parameters, such as variance in mea-<lb/>surements between experiments could be inferred from com-<lb/>bining the entire data set into one model. When prior knowl-<lb/>edge on the experimental parameters is available, a Bayesian <lb/>model can be used to e ectively infer this type of uncertainty <lb/>from the data, and use it to propagate the error into log D <lb/>estimates. Distinctions could be made between an objec-<lb/>tive treatment of the problem, or an empirical Bayesian ap-<lb/>proach, where prior parameters are derived from the data. <lb/>One could use a maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability ap-<lb/>proach to obtain an estimate of one of the modes of the <lb/>parameter distribution. This has obvious downsides when <lb/>posterior densities are multimodal, and in such a case, one <lb/>may wish to estimate the shape of the entire posterior distri-<lb/>bution instead. An approach like Markov chain Monte Carlo <lb/>could provide such estimates, and will allow for calculation <lb/>of credible intervals. MCMC methods can be computationally <lb/>intensive compared to MAP, though if the resulting posterior <lb/>is complicated, a MAP estimate can give poor results. Un-<lb/>fortunately, we were unable to construct a Bayesian model <lb/>of the experiments within our time constraints. We would <lb/>encourage future challenges to make an attempt at creating <lb/>a Bayesian model, since this would allow for robust inference <lb/>of all experimental parameters. <lb/>. Funding future challenges <lb/>The execution of this work would not have been possi-<lb/>ble without the resources provided by Genentech. Access <lb/>to a rich library of compounds onsite allowed us to select <lb/>a dataset that was both challenging and useful for the pur-<lb/>poses of the SAMPL challenge. At the same time, the instru-<lb/>mentation provided us with the bandwidth to perform many <lb/>measurements. Rapid redesign of experiments by trial and <lb/>error, as a result of the di iculties with cyclohexane compati-<lb/>bility of laboratory consumables and equipment, would not <lb/>have been possible without the expertise shared by Genen-<lb/>tech scientists and the opportunities to do many measure-<lb/>ments. <lb/>Future iterations of this challenge would benefit from con-<lb/>tinued collaboration between industry and academia. Aca-<lb/>demic groups can partner with industry groups to pair avail-<lb/>able skilled academic labor (graduate students and postdoc-<lb/>toral researchers) with specialized measurement equipment <lb/>and compound libraries. The graduate student industry in-<lb/>ternship model proved to be a particularly successful ap-<lb/>proach, with measurements for a blind challenge providing <lb/>a well-defined, limited-scope project with clear high value to <lb/>the modeling community. <lb/>
			V. CONCLUSION <lb/>The experimental data provided by this study was very <lb/>useful for hosting the first small-molecule distribution coe i-<lb/>cient challenge in the context of SAMPL. It revealed that log D <lb/>prediction, as well as measurement, is not always straightfor-<lb/>ward. We showed that it was possible to perform cyclohex-<lb/>ane/water log D measurements in the same manner as the <lb/>original octanol/water assays, though further optimizations <lb/>are needed to reach the same level of throughput. Cyclo-<lb/>hexane did pose several challenges for experimental design, <lb/>such as the need for di erent container types, and the po-<lb/>tential accumulation of substrate on reversed phase HPLC <lb/>columns. <lb/>Many details, such as protonation states, tautomer states, <lb/>and dimerization might need to be accounted for in order <lb/>to reproduce experiments. This challenge taught us con-<lb/>siderations that should be made on the experimental side. <lb/>Cases where dimerization were pointed out as possible rea-<lb/>son for discrepancy between experiment and model, could <lb/>only be hypothesized from the modeling end and not tested <lb/>experimentally. Issues with detector saturation could also <lb/>be a ecting the overall quality of the data set. Future experi-<lb/>ments would benefit from more rigorous protocols, such as <lb/>measurements at multiple concentrations, and models of all <lb/>experimental components. <lb/>We recommend that future challenges, and experiments in <lb/>general, use physical models of experiments in the analysis <lb/>of experimental uncertainty. These should be part of the <lb/>analysis procedure, but also in experimental design. These <lb/>will reveal abnormalities in data more clearly. <lb/>We recommend that future challenges look into the use <lb/>of bootstrap models such as those considered here. Addi-<lb/>tionally, the use of Bayesian inference methods, that allow <lb/>the incorporation of prior information should lead to a more <lb/>robust estimate of experimental uncertainty. They will allow <lb/>for joint inference on multiple experiments, thereby increas-<lb/>ing the information gain by using the model. <lb/>Lastly, the sponsoring of this internship by Genentech was <lb/>fundamental to generating this data. Access to compound <lb/>libraries, and the equipment to perform the experiments is <lb/>crucial to the design and execution of a study. Close collabo-<lb/>rations with Genentech scientists were important in solving <lb/>many technical challenges. The collaboration between indus-<lb/>try and academics was not only fruitful, but fundamental in <lb/>establishing standardized challenges for the modeling field. <lb/>The amount of data we were able to gather would have been <lb/>hard to come by without industry resources. At the same <lb/>time, the need and expertise in investigating these challeng-<lb/>ing physical chemical problems provided by the community, <lb/>and the forum provided by the SAMPL challenge was essen-<lb/>tial in turning this challenge into a success. We welcome <lb/>such future e orts and collaborations, as it is apparent that <lb/>both experimental and computational approaches for ob-<lb/>taining log D estimates for small molecules, would benefit <lb/>from further optimization. <lb/></body>
