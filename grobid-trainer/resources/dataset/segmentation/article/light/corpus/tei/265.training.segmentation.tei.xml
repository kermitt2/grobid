			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>ir traffic control aims to maintain the safety for <lb/>passengers and goods. This task puts them in a complex <lb/>decision making system. They communicate with pilots using <lb/>clearances to keep minimal separation of aircraft. The context <lb/>is highly dynamic; data presented to the air traffic controller <lb/>come from manifold sources: flight plan, radar data, data link, <lb/>metrological data, and supervision systems. The decision must <lb/>be planned in real time and frequently updated. This is the <lb/>reason why the air traffic controllers&apos; display must be sharp, <lb/>and must reduce their cognitive workload. <lb/>The displays used by the air traffic controllers involve <lb/>many animated visual entities. They are constrained by precise <lb/>rules of representation. The richness of these re-presentations <lb/>highlights the paucity of tools currently available to <lb/>differentiate them. The increments of such instruments are <lb/>numerous, in terms of validation, design and safety. The <lb/>objective of this article is to establish the basis to study <lb/>representations, to find out methods of characterization that <lb/>would allow comparisons between representations, and <lb/>eventually to assess them. <lb/>II. INFORMATION VISUALIZATION <lb/>Information visualization (IV) is an expanding field of <lb/>research, but rare are those who have formalized its non-<lb/>artistic approach. In the wide range of existing visualization <lb/>methods, very few of them are actually supported by scientific <lb/>considerations, and even fewer have been formally evaluated <lb/>in a rigorous context. Some are starting to address this issue <lb/>[[25], [28]] and some have summarized it in a framework <lb/>[[ <lb/>ysemic (the perceiver can <lb/>ha <lb/>semiotic to correspond to the meaning of a <lb/>gr <lb/>are perceivable, but they are <lb/>no <lb/>in particular a graphical language <lb/>to <lb/>of IV in <lb/>ge <lb/>, zoom, filter, details on demand, relate, history, <lb/>ex <lb/>[[2 <lb/>18]]. <lb/>The Works of Bertin [[1]], act as a reference: &quot; the graphic &quot; <lb/>is the mono-semantic visual representation of data. We can <lb/>contrast his formalism with music or modern abstract art, in <lb/>which the represented data is pol <lb/>ve different interpretations). <lb/>The aims of visualization techniques have been fairly well <lb/>established [[26]]. According to Bertin, the visual data <lb/>representation has three issues; store data, spread information <lb/>(the communication is carried out with known data in <lb/>advance), process information (the handling and the <lb/>perception of the data allow the analysis and the resolution of <lb/>the problem). Bertin made simple observations of visual <lb/>displays. He introduced seven visual variables: position, size, <lb/>shape, orientation, brightness, color, and granularity. <lb/>Granularity is often translated as texture, but it really means <lb/>granularity (as in the granularity of a photograph). Granularity <lb/>in this sense is also related to the spatial frequency of a <lb/>texture. Thus, he formulated issues of visual decoding and <lb/>proposed techniques for enhancing it. But he eschewed <lb/>principles of vision theory. For psychological theories on <lb/>Bertin&apos;s work, we can consult Kosslyn&apos;s books [[13]]. <lb/>Kosslyn, for instance, introduced the compatibility rules, <lb/>which leads the <lb/>aphical representation. <lb/>Wilkinson [[28]], among other things, has extended the <lb/>classification system of Bertin. He prefers the word aesthetics <lb/>to describe an object in a graphical system, because the word <lb/>perception is subjective rather than objective, and perception <lb/>refers to the perceiver rather than the object. Aesthetics turns <lb/>graphs into graphics so that they <lb/>t the perceptions themselves. <lb/>Mackinlay continued Bertin&apos;s work by presenting tools <lb/>allowing the generation and the validation of graphic <lb/>interfaces [[15]]. It develops <lb/>codify a representation. <lb/>Tufte illustrated the possible application fields <lb/>ographical, historical, economic situations [[26]]. <lb/>Shneiderman classified visualizations according to the <lb/>number of dimensions of the displayed data, to the data <lb/>representation structure (temporal, multi-dimensional, tree, <lb/>networks). He continued his work by identifying seven <lb/>minimal tasks to ensure the visualization of the data [[24]] <lb/>(overview <lb/>tract). <lb/>Card and Mackinlay (C&amp;M) carried out a taxonomy of <lb/>various charts of information in the form of a table [[5]]. This <lb/>taxonomy is partially based on the theory of Bertin. C&amp;M <lb/>applied it to twelve well-known visualizations, such as the <lb/>ordered matrices [[1],[19]], TreeMap [[11]] or ConeTree <lb/>1]]. This article will detail their work in the following <lb/>sections. <lb/> A <lb/></body>

To reach this goal, the design space m <lb/>III. DATA FLOW MODEL <lb/> Card, Mackinlay and Shneiderman contribute greatly to our <lb/>knowledge in the field of visualizations [[6]]. They created a <lb/>model (Fig. 1) which describes visualizations as a data <lb/>processing sequence from the raw data to the display. The <lb/>processing is based on structures of intermediate data <lb/>h is <lb/>of <lb/> Fig. 1 : Schematic Dataflow of Information Visualization [[5]] <lb/> This model is based on the management of a data flow. It is <lb/>used in many toolkits (InfoViz [[10]], prefuse, VTK, Tul <lb/>Pajek…) and visualization software (SpotFire [[1]], ILOG <lb/>nVizN [[28]]…). <lb/> ip, <lb/>Discovery [[2]], <lb/> A. Data type <lb/> We define the attributes as the typed date from the dataset, <lb/>and the properties, the visual representation of a data e.g. if we <lb/>use the co <lb/>FL data are the attribute and the color is the (visual) <lb/>property. <lb/>The major distinction we can make for attributes is whether <lb/>their values are: <lb/> 񮽙 Nominal: are only equal or different to other values (e.g. <lb/>aircraft call sign), <lb/> 񮽙 Ordered: obey a &lt; rule (e.g. an aircraft&apos;s number in the <lb/>landing sequenc <lb/> 񮽙 Quantitative: can be manipulated by arithmetic (e.g. the <lb/>aircraft <lb/>The quantitative type can be split into two parts: Interval <lb/>and Ration. <lb/>The Interval can derive the gap between values but cannot <lb/>be null, e.g. the time lapse <lb/>me than 14.00am to 15.00am but we cannot say that <lb/>15.00am is twice 7.00am. <lb/>expressi <lb/>able summa <lb/>e different term <lb/> TABLE 1 <lb/> in the literat <lb/> DATA TYPES <lb/> ertin [[1] <lb/>[[23 <lb/>[[27 <lb/>Nominal <lb/>Nominal <lb/>Category <lb/>Ordinal <lb/>O rdinal <lb/>Integer <lb/>Interval <lb/>Quantitative <lb/>Ratio <lb/>Real number <lb/> B. Data structure <lb/> Bertin has suggested that there are two fundamental forms <lb/>of data: data values and data structures. A similar idea is to <lb/>divide data into entities and relationships. Entities are the <lb/>ob <lb/>rld, the call sign links the <lb/>radar data. If we display over time the position of an aircraft, <lb/>n IV, Metadata mean data derived from other <lb/>d <lb/>e <lb/>): <lb/>e (e.g. sorting variables) <lb/>h between value and structure <lb/>ar <lb/>trinsically different but their <lb/>presentation problems are the same, thus we won&apos;t make <lb/>any special survey for metadata. <lb/>jects we wish to visualize, and relations define the <lb/>structures and patterns that relate entities to each other. <lb/>He defines five data structures: linear, circular, ordered tree, <lb/>un-ordered tree, and volume. The data structure is the link that <lb/>clusters the data. In the ATC wo <lb/>we display a linear data structure. <lb/> C. Data transformation: the metadata <lb/> There is a common misconception about metadata. In a <lb/>database, metadata are the explanation of a database field <lb/>(e.g. AFL is the actual Flight level of the aircraft in a <lb/>dataset). But i <lb/>ata, this is a transformation that creates new data out of th <lb/>existing data. <lb/>Tweedy found four types of data transformations (Fig. 2 <lb/> 񮽙 Values to Derived Values (e.g. mean processing) <lb/> 񮽙 Structures to Derived Structur <lb/> 񮽙 Values to Derived Structures <lb/> 񮽙 Structure to Derived Values <lb/>Transformations that switc <lb/>e more complex.

ODS is the main French radar view displayed for <lb/>the air traffic controllers; Aster is a vertical view of the <lb/>current flying aircraft, Maestro is an Arrival manager, and <lb/>ERATO displays future aircraft conflicts. <lb/> Fi <lb/> ATC visualizations display the same information, thus to <lb/>compare them we need very precise tools. <lb/> g. 3 : ATC Data source <lb/>Fi <lb/> e terms used to depict the radar track. <lb/>different levels of <lb/>cr <lb/>minimum aircraft separation). <lb/>he ATC data structure is linked to the attribute named <lb/>t possible to describe <lb/>th radar image using a dataflow and connections with the <lb/>visual variables of Bertin (Figure 3). <lb/>ation can lead to efficient, accurate visual decoding <lb/>of <lb/>a visualization <lb/>an <lb/>d named them the gulf of Execution (how to <lb/>sol <lb/>s the interface goal.

Supervision <lb/> Graphics, according to Bertin, have at least three distinct <lb/>uses (c.f. introduction): store, communicate, discover. <lb/>The images of the ATC world are not visualizations <lb/>dedicated to exploration. They are described as supervision, <lb/>because the input data change independently of the user. But <lb/>the user can perform actions on the system; in principle, he <lb/>tries to improve it. Such action has <lb/>iticism: just convenient (giving a direct routing) to critic <lb/>(avoiding <lb/>T <lb/>callsign. <lb/> F.

The second problem is to <lb/>understand the computered results, what is the graphical <lb/>meaning of the displayed data. Norman [[16]] identified these <lb/>two problems an <lb/>ve a problem with a computer) and the gulf of Evaluation <lb/>(what do I see). <lb/>The air traffic controller uses supervision interfaces, thus <lb/>the gulf of execution is reduced. The field of action is limited, <lb/>and the displayed information fit <lb/> . 5 : dataflow implementation <lb/> Cleveland, McGill and then Mackinlay [ <lb/> Fig <lb/> [15]] built scales of <lb/>expressivity (monosemic, but dependant on a precise <lb/>graphical language) and effectiveness (depend on the human <lb/>perceptual capabilities) to assess alternative designs (Fig. 6). <lb/> This scale depends on the data type. The visual property <lb/>higher in the chart is perceived more accurately than those <lb/>lower in the chart. The grey items are not relevant to that type <lb/>of information. The quantitative data type ranking as been <lb/>experimentally verified by Cleveland [[9]]. Independently of <lb/>the data type, the best way to represent the data is to code it <lb/>with a position on a scale. If we want to represent the speed of <lb/>an aircraft (quantitative data), we can use the length of a line <lb/>(speed vector). The aircraft position number in the landing <lb/>sequence (Ordinal) is better coded using the color saturation <lb/>than length. <lb/> Fig. 6 : Mackinlay ranking of perceptual task [[15]] <lb/> Speed vector <lb/>Label <lb/>Leader <lb/>t <lb/>Current aircraft <lb/>osition <lb/>Come <lb/>p <lb/>

Thus, <lb/>in Fig. 8, the shape of the comet indicates that the plane <lb/>turned 90° to the right and accelerated. These data are <lb/>emergent in the comet. In other words, they were not directly <lb/>used to generate the image. The characterization of C&amp;M does <lb/>not make it possible to characterize this essential information <lb/>for the users, and thus does not allow the comparison of <lb/>different visualizations objectively.
