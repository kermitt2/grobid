We perform <lb/>a redshift analysis of all sources in the data cube and identify a total of 12 systems ranging <lb/>from z = 1.46 to 6.4, with all images of each system confirmed by a spectroscopic redshift. <lb/>This allows us to accurately constrain the cluster mass profile in this region. We foresee that <lb/>future MUSE observations of cluster cores should help us discover very faint Lyman α emitters <lb/>thanks to the strong magnification and the high sensitivity of this instrument. <lb/> Key words: galaxies: clusters: individual: SMACSJ2031.8-4036. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 INTRODUCTION <lb/> Galaxy cluster cores contain large concentrations of dark matter, <lb/>and in such act as powerful gravitational lenses. At its strongest, the <lb/>deflection of light rays from distant galaxies can create multiple im-<lb/>ages of a single source (Kneib &amp; Natarajan 2011), and the location <lb/>of such multiples can be used to infer the total mass distribution in <lb/>cluster cores (Richard et al. 2010; Zitrin et al. 2012). <lb/>Since the discovery of the first lensed systems in cluster cores, <lb/>dedicated whole-sky cluster searches such as the MAssive Cluster <lb/>Survey (MACS; Ebeling, Edge &amp; Henry 2001; Ebeling et al. 2010), <lb/>followed up by multiband Hubble imaging, have provided a large <lb/>number of multiple systems in individual lensing clusters (Zitrin <lb/>et al. 2011; Limousin et al. 2012). The largest number of multiple <lb/>systems so far have been found in the clusters Abell 1689 (34 <lb/>systems; Limousin et al. 2007), and the recent Frontier fields clusters <lb/>(Jauzac et al. 2014a,b; Richard et al. 2014 with 68 systems for <lb/>MACSJ0416.1-2403). <lb/>An important part of the mass modelling relies on getting accurate <lb/>spectroscopic redshifts for the lensed sources, to completely confirm <lb/>the lensing system and to avoid degeneracies in the mass normaliza-<lb/></body>

			<body>tion. As the typical magnitude range for lensed sources found with <lb/>Hubble is ∼23–25 AB (Richard et al. 2009; Jauzac et al. 2014a), <lb/>deep spectroscopy is required. Large spectroscopic campaigns have <lb/>been performed with multi-object spectrographs (Grillo et al. 2014; <lb/>Johnson et al. 2014), but they rely on a preselection based on deep <lb/>multiband Hubble images and are quite inefficient since all multiple <lb/>images are crowded in the cluster core. <lb/>The advent of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; <lb/>Bacon et al. 2010), recently commissioned on the Very Large <lb/>Telescope, may well set a new benchmark in the study of galaxy <lb/>cluster cores. By providing integral field optical spectroscopy over <lb/>a sky area of 1 × 1 arcmin 2 , MUSE perfectly catches the full locus <lb/>of multiple images in a moderately massive cluster. MUSE acts <lb/>as a powerful redshift machine to identify faint emission lines of <lb/>high equivalent width not appearing in classical continuum imag-<lb/>ing, in particular Lyman α emitters at 2.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.7 probing the <lb/>high-redshift Universe. <lb/>Here, we present the first results obtained on deep pointed MUSE <lb/>observations towards a massive cluster, SMACSJ2031.8-4036. We <lb/>perform a redshift measurement of all sources in the MUSE field <lb/>of view and identify multiply-imaged systems based on spectro-<lb/>scopic redshifts, the majority of which are not detected with short <lb/>exposure Hubble images. This allows us to improve the clus-<lb/>ter mass model in this region very significantly. Throughout this <lb/> </body>

			<body>Figure 1. Overview of all multiple-image systems (in yellow) identified <lb/>over a Hubble colour image combining the F606W and F814W bands (north <lb/>up, east left). The white polygon delineates the 1 × 1 arcmin 2 region covered <lb/>by the MUSE observations used in this paper. The cyan, green and red lines <lb/>show the critical lines predicted by our revised mass model (Section 4) <lb/>at z = 1.46 (system 6), z = 3.5077 (systems 1 and 2) and z = 6.4085 <lb/>(system 9). <lb/> Letter, we adopt a 񮽙 cold dark matter cosmology with 񮽙 񮽙  = 0.7, <lb/> 񮽙  M  = 0.3 and H = 70 km s  −1  Mpc  −1  . At the redshift of the clus-<lb/>ter z = 0.331, 1 arcsec on sky corresponds to a physical distance <lb/>of 4.763 kpc. <lb/> 2 OBSERVATIONS <lb/> SMACSJ2031.8-4036 (hereafter SMACSJ2031; α = 20:31:47.843, <lb/> δ = −40:36:54.76, z = 0.331, Christensen et al. 2012) has been <lb/>observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of snapshot <lb/>programmes 12166 and 12884 (PI: Ebeling), using the Advanced <lb/>Camera For Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). <lb/>The ACS data were taken in the F606W and F814W filters for <lb/>1.2 and 1.44 ks, respectively, and the WFC3 data were taken in <lb/> F110W and F140W for 0.7 ks each. The data were reduced using <lb/> MULTIDRIZZLE (Koekemoer et al. 2002) and the astrometry tied to the <lb/>USNO catalogue. <lb/>The Hubble images reveal a bimodal cluster, with two distinct <lb/>concentrations of cluster galaxies located 1.2 arcmin apart. The HST <lb/> images are centred on the NW subcluster, and therefore the WFC3 <lb/>data only partially cover the SE subcluster (∼40 per cent of the <lb/>MUSE field of view described below). <lb/>An early analysis of these images revealed a five-imaged strongly <lb/>lensed system identified by its morphology, and measured by <lb/>Christensen et al. (2012) at z = 3.5077 using XShooter (images <lb/>1.1–1.5 in Fig. 1). Additional candidate radial arcs were discovered <lb/>around the SE sub cluster, showing the potential for confirming <lb/>more multiple images in this region. <lb/>For this reason, SMACSJ2031 was targeted as part of MUSE <lb/>commissioning (ESO programme 60.A-9100(B)) to demonstrate <lb/>the power of MUSE once combined with lensing magnification. A <lb/>total of 10.4 h of observations were obtained in nominal (WFM-<lb/>NOAO-N) mode between 2014 April 30 and May 7, and the 1 × 1 <lb/>arcmin 2 field of view was centred on the SE cluster to cover the pre-<lb/>dicted locus of multiple images (Fig. 1). A small random dithering <lb/>pattern (within a 0.6 arcsec box) and 90  •  rotations of the instrument <lb/>were performed between each exposure of 1200 s. <lb/> Figure 2. Overview of all redshifts measured in MUSE observations. The left-hand panel shows a MUSE colour image produced by collapsing three contiguous <lb/>wavelength ranges in the whole cube. The green crosses identify cluster members confirmed by our spectroscopy. Cyan and red circles show the redshifts of <lb/>foreground and single image background sources, respectively, while the yellow crosses mark the location of multiple images. The right-hand panel shows a <lb/>combination of all narrow-band images showing the emission lines in multiply imaged systems 1–12. Lyman α emitters are presented in red, while [O II] and <lb/>C III] emitters are shown in blue and green, respectively. <lb/>

			The MUSE data were reduced and combined into a single data <lb/>cube using the MUSE data reduction software (Weilbacher et al. in <lb/>preparation), and further processed with the ZAP software (Soto et al. <lb/>in preparation) which suppresses residuals of sky subtraction using a <lb/>principal component analysis. Flux calibration was performed based <lb/>on observations of the spectrophotometric standard HD 49798 (O6 <lb/>star) and GD108 (subdwarf B star). The final data cube is sampled <lb/>at a pixel scale of 0.2 arcsec and covers the wavelength range 4750– <lb/>9350 Å with a dispersion of 1.25 Å per pixel and a resolution <lb/>increasing from R ∼ 2000 to R ∼ 4000 between the blue and red <lb/>end. The seeing varied from 0.6 to 1.2 arcsec between each exposure <lb/>and is measured to be ∼0.95 arcsec in the final combined data cube <lb/>based on the brightest star in the field. More details about the data <lb/>reduction and quality of the final products will be given in Patricio <lb/>et al. (to be submitted). <lb/> 3 DATA ANALYSIS <lb/> We searched the MUSE data cube for spectral features, both for <lb/>continuum-detected sources and for objects dominated by nebu-<lb/>lar emission lines. We first produced &apos;white-light&apos; and colour im-<lb/>ages by collapsing the cube over its full wavelength range or in <lb/>the blue/green/red wavelengths (Fig. 2, left-hand panel). We ran <lb/>SEXTRACTOR (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996) to identify objects in the <lb/>white-light image and measured their continuum levels at three <lb/>wavelengths. The spectra of these continuum sources were extracted <lb/>using the spatial extent measured in the white-light image. <lb/>In addition, we produced pseudo-narrow-band images by per-<lb/>forming a running average of five adjacent wavelength planes <lb/>(6.25 Å width) in the whole cube, using a weighting scheme to en-<lb/>hance the detection of typical σ ∼ 100 km s  −1  emission lines. We ran <lb/>SEXTRACTOR again in each of these narrow-band images, and com-<lb/>pared the detections with the previous continuum measurements <lb/>to identify emission lines associated with continuum sources and <lb/>isolated emission lines. Examples of continuum-subtracted narrow-<lb/>band detections are given in Fig. 2 (right-hand panel). All emis-<lb/>sion lines are well-detected and resolved over multiple wavelength <lb/>planes throughout the cube. <lb/>Redshifts were measured for both continuum-and emission-line-<lb/>dominated sources by identifying a combination of emission and ab-<lb/>sorption line features. The large majority of continuum sources iden-<lb/>tified are formed by cluster members (53) and foreground sources <lb/>(3), easily recognizable with K 3933 Å and H 3969 Å absorp-<lb/>tion features (green and cyan crosses, respectively, in the left-hand <lb/>panel of Fig. 2). Background sources are all identified through their <lb/>emission lines or Lyman α break, in particular [O III] 5007 Å at <lb/> z &lt; 0.8, [O II] 3727 Å at &lt;1.5, but for the large majority with Ly-<lb/>man α 1216 Å at z &gt; 2.8 (Table 1). As Lyman α is usually the <lb/>only spectral feature visible in the MUSE wavelength range, we <lb/>rely on its typical asymmetric shape and the absence of a doublet <lb/>or other emission lines to ascertain the redshift (Fig. 3). We also <lb/>measured the redshifts of candidate arcs and multiple images visible <lb/>in HST images, through [O II] at z = 1.46 (system 6), C III] 1907, <lb/>1909 Å at z = 2.2556 (system 11) or a Lyman α break at z = 3.41 <lb/>(system 12). <lb/>We searched through the redshifts measured in the cube for <lb/>multiple images based on a preliminary mass modelling of the <lb/>cluster core, which used only the five-imaged system at z = 3.5077 <lb/>(Christensen et al. 2012). We found reliable connections for 43 <lb/>sources forming a total of 12 systems (combining continuum and <lb/>emission-line dominated sources), with the predictions from the <lb/>model always lying within 1 arcsec from the detection. We then <lb/> Table 1. Multiple image systems (top part) and other single image lensed <lb/>sources (bottom part).

			4 CLUSTER MASS MODELLING <lb/> Following our previous work on cluster mass modelling (Limousin <lb/>et al. 2007; Jauzac et al. 2014a), we used the locations and redshifts <lb/>of the 12 multiple systems identified to constrain a parametric mass <lb/>model of the cluster using the LENSTOOL (Jullo et al. 2007) software. 1 <lb/> In short, we adopt a dual pseudo-isothermal elliptical mass distri-<lb/>bution (dPIE, also known as truncated PIEMD, see Elíasdóttir et al. <lb/>2007), which corresponds to an isothermal profile with two char-<lb/>acteristic radii: a core radius r  core (producing a flattening of the <lb/>mass distribution at the centre), and a cut radius r  cut (producing a <lb/>drop-off of the mass distribution on large scales). Our preliminary <lb/>mass model of SMACSJ2031, which we used in Christensen et al. <lb/>(2012) to derive magnification factors, assumed a single cluster-<lb/>scale dPIE component centred on the SE cluster as well as individual <lb/>

			 galaxy-scale dPIE profiles on each cluster member following a scal-<lb/>ing relation with luminosity (see e.g. Richard et al. 2010). <lb/>With the addition of new multiple images, we refine this mass <lb/>model by incorporating a second cluster-scale mass component <lb/>centred on the NW cluster, located 1.2 arcmin away. This extends <lb/>the critical line in the NW–SE direction (Fig. 1) and gives a much <lb/>better match with the new systems 6–10 located in this region. One <lb/>can clearly see the effect of this extension of the critical line towards <lb/>the upper-right corner of the MUSE field of view, with an absence of <lb/>multiple images identified in the lower-left corner. The best-fitting <lb/>parameters of the new mass model are presented in Table 2. <lb/>The two-component mass model now reproduces all 12 multiple <lb/>systems with an rms of 0.41arcsec in the image plane. Although <lb/>the centroid precision of the emission lines is much better than this <lb/>for the MUSE data (typically 0.1arcsec) such a scatter is expected <lb/>because of additional lensing structures along the line of sight (see <lb/>the discussion in Jullo et al. 2010). An illustration of the ability <lb/>to reproduce the systems is shown in the critical lines presented <lb/>in Fig. 1 as we expect a symmetry of multiple images against <lb/>the corresponding critical line. The projected cluster mass profile <lb/>(radially integrated from the location of the brightest galaxy in the <lb/>SE cluster) is presented in Fig. 4, together with the strong-lensing <lb/>constraints. We can see that the profile is best constrained within <lb/>

			 Figure 4. Projected cluster mass profile integrated over the radial distances <lb/>from the centre of the SE cluster (red curve). The radial distance of all <lb/>multiple images used as strong-lensing constraints are marked with black <lb/>ticks. We overplot in green the range of mass profiles allowed by the previous <lb/>mass model (which only used constraints from system 1), showing the gain <lb/>in precision obtained with the MUSE data. <lb/> 10–150 kpc by the large number of multiple images. The precision <lb/>obtained on the integrated mass in this region is a few per cent, <lb/>about five times better than the previous model. <lb/>We use this mass model to estimate the magnifications for all <lb/>background sources, and report the values in Table 1. Errors on <lb/>the magnification factors are estimated for each source by pro-<lb/>ducing 500 mass models sampling the posterior probability distri-<lb/>bution of the dPIE parameters, and measuring the distribution of <lb/>magnifications at this location. Thanks to the high density of con-<lb/>straints in the cluster core, the relative error on magnification factors <lb/>are typically 5–30 per cent, which is similar to the precision reached <lb/>in the Hubble Frontier Fields (Jauzac et al. 2014a). <lb/>We also check that all of the 14 other background sources iden-<lb/>tified (s1–s14 in Table 1, ranging from z = 0.5 to 4.01) are indeed <lb/>predicted to be single images by this model, as they are all located <lb/>in the SE corner of the MUSE field of view. Three counter images <lb/>identified are not detected in the observations for the following rea-<lb/>sons: image 9.3 is predicted to lie outside of the MUSE field of <lb/>view, and images 2.2 and 11.5 are predicted to be located under the <lb/>brightest cluster member, thus suffering from strong cluster light <lb/>contamination. <lb/>To summarize, the sensitivity, resolution and wide field of view <lb/>of MUSE, when coupled with the strong-lensing region of a clus-<lb/>ter core, form the perfect combination to detect numerous lensing <lb/>systems and use them as constraints to measure the cluster mass <lb/>profile. Further, more detailed analysis could include the resolved <lb/>constraints from cluster members in the cluster core, for which we <lb/>can measure the individual velocity dispersions with the MUSE <lb/>data. <lb/>In addition, accounting for the magnification factor, we show here <lb/>that we can reliably measure the redshifts for Lyman α emitters that <lb/>are intrinsically as faint as 2 × 10  −19  erg s  −1  cm  −2  (images 8.1 and <lb/>8.2) and up to z = 6.4 (system 9). The multiplicity of these sources <lb/>in the strong-lensing regime helps to confirm these faint lines to be <lb/>Lyman α. We expect that targeting lensing cluster with MUSE will <lb/>result in the detection of a large number of such faint emitters at <lb/>high redshift. <lb/>
