			Abstract <lb/> Background  Presence at the same time of HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies (HBsAg/Ab) is an entity <lb/>sometimes encountered in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers. <lb/> Objectives  This study was designed to characterize such serological profiles and to assess the <lb/>reliability of serological marker quantification by three commercially available assays in this setting. <lb/> Study design  Among 2578 CHB identified patients, 129 (5%) had an HBsAg/Ab profile as determined <lb/>by Abbott Architect. After exclusion of co-infections (HIV, HCV, HDV), HBV reactivation or HBIg <lb/>treatment, 101 samples from 62 patients were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs quantification using <lb/>Architect, DiaSorin Liaison-XL and Roche Modular-Cobas. Influence of genotype and HBsAg variants <lb/>was studied in 31 samples with HBV replication. <lb/> Results  HBsAg detection was confirmed with the 3 techniques for 98% (n=99) of the samples while the <lb/>HBsAg/Ab profile was concordant between all techniques for 65% of them. The overall correlation <lb/>between the 3 HBsAg quantification techniques was good (r <lb/> 2 <lb/> : 0.94-0.97). The median HBsAg <lb/>concentration was comparable for the 99 samples whatever the used technique but a bias of -0.11 <lb/>and 0.02 log IU/mL were noticed for DiaSorin and Roche compared to Abbott, respectively. Anti-HBs <lb/>quantifications were poorly correlated between techniques with major discrepancies observed. <lb/>Genotype and substitutions within the &quot;a&quot; determinant showed an impact on HBsAg quantification. <lb/> Conclusions  The double HBsAg/Ab profile is not an analytical artifact and is confirmed on all <lb/>commercially available techniques. While such profile does not influence HBsAg quantification, <lb/>differences of HBsAg quantification were noticed according to HBV genotype or HBsAg variant. <lb/>Keywords: HBsAg quantification – HBsAg variant – Genotype – immune complexes -interference <lb/>

			<body> Background <lb/> HBsAg is a key marker for the diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection. Available qualitative or <lb/>quantitative assays detect all circulating HBsAg containing particles, mainly infectious virions (Dane <lb/>particles) but in a large excess non infectious/defective particles (1). While chronic infection is defined <lb/>by the persistence of HBsAg over 6 months, HBsAg loss and appearance of anti-HBs Ab (anti-HBs) <lb/>usually sign viral clearance. Yet, occurrence of anti-HBs is sometimes observed despite persistence of <lb/>HBsAg and viral replication. The prevalence of this entity has been reported in less than 5 % to more <lb/>than 25 % of CHB cases, depending on the studies (2–5). <lb/>The molecular and immunologic mechanisms leading to this serologic profile remain unclear but could <lb/>be due to the selection of HBV escape mutants by immune pressure (6–8). In this scenario, the <lb/>detected circulating antibodies are directed against an HBV strain not present anymore. Indeed, <lb/>several reports have shown an association of this pattern with an increased proportion of HBsAg <lb/>mutants characterized by specific substitution or deletion in the preS/S gene, especially in the &quot;a&quot; <lb/>determinant region. Amino acid substitutions within this epitope could modify the antigenic <lb/>conformation of HBsAg and alter the binding of both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies; <lb/>the main consequences being the emergence of an immune escape variant and an alteration of <lb/>HBsAg detection assay (3,4,9–13). <lb/>Most recently, the amount of circulating HBsAg has been recognized as a potential biomarker linked to <lb/>the liver disease stage, the risk of HCC or the chance to respond to interferon therapy (14–17). Beside <lb/>the most widely used Architect assay (Abbott), two other CE marked assays are also available for the <lb/>quantification of HBsAg, the Elecsys platform (Roche) and the Liaison-XL from DiaSorin. These <lb/>assays use both mononoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies to enhance recognition of HBsAg and <lb/>HBsAg mutants. Several studies have convincingly demonstrated the comparable performances of <lb/>Roche and Abbott assays (18–20). More recently, the DiaSorin assay was shown to perform <lb/>comparably to the Architect assay in sequential serum samples from 14 HBe-negative patients (21). <lb/> Objectives <lb/> The aims of our study were first to document the performances of the DiaSorin assay compared to our <lb/>routine Abbott&apos;s Architect HBsAg quantification. Secondly, the robustness of HBsAg quantification <lb/>using the three CE marked available assays on a panel of CHB seras containing both HBsAg and anti-<lb/>

			HBs was challenged. One main issue was to determine whether concomitant detection of both <lb/>HBsAg/anti-HBs could solely be an analytical artifact linked to a specific assay. Likewise, a further <lb/>goal was to assess the ability of these assays to quantify potential variants more prone to be selected <lb/>in these peculiar serological profiles. <lb/> Study design <lb/> Patients and sera <lb/> In the first part of the study comparing Abbott and DiaSorin on HBsAg positive samples, 227 sera <lb/>successively tested for HBsAg quantification between September and November 2012 on Architect <lb/>(Abbott, Rungis, France) were tested on DiaSorin Liaison-XL (Antony, France). <lb/>One hundred and one sera corresponding to 62 CHB patients identified HBsAg/anti-HBs positive on <lb/>Architect between January 2008 and June 2012 and stored at -20°C were selected. Exclusion criteria <lb/>were any HIV, hepatitis C or hepatitis D coinfection, HBIg passive immunization or reactivation of past <lb/>HBV infection. All sera were subsequently tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs on the Roche Elecsys <lb/>system (Meylan, France) and DiaSorin Liaison-XL, according to each manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>recommendation. The measurements were performed within 5 days on all systems. <lb/>Among the 62 selected patients, 31 had also an HBV viral load above 100 IU/mL on the same day as <lb/>HBsAg quantification and sequencing of the HBsAg gene could be performed on -80°C stored plasma. <lb/>Unless specified, HBsAg quantification was reported in log 10 IU/mL and anti-HBs in IU/L. The study <lb/>general outline is presented on figure 1. <lb/>HBsAg gene sequencing method <lb/>HBV-DNA was purified from 500µL of plasma using Nuclisens EasyMAG (Biomérieux, Marcilly, <lb/>France) and resuspended in 70µL of sterile water. Amplification of part of the HBsAg coding region (nt. <lb/>186-1196, aa 100-227) was performed as previously described (4). Sequences were aligned and <lb/>compared to selected Genbank reference sequences of known genotype using SeqScape (Applied <lb/>Biosytems) and Mega (v5) softwares (22). For analysis purpose, HBsAg was divided into 3 regions: <lb/>residues 100-123, 124-147 (&quot;a&quot; determinant) and 148-221. Substitutions were determined manually <lb/>and with the help of two online tools (http://hbv.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ and http://www.hiv-grade.de). <lb/> Statistical analysis <lb/>

			<page> 6 <lb/></page>

			 Statistical analysis, were performed using Analyze-it software. Chisquare and Fischer tests were used <lb/>for categorical variables. Mean and medians were analyzed with Mann Whitney and Kruskal tests. <lb/>Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare methods. Significance was defined by a P value below <lb/>0.05. <lb/> Results <lb/> Overall performances of Liaison-XL HBsAg quantification on 227 HBsAg positive samples <lb/> On these 227 samples, there was a strong correlation (p&lt;0.001) between both Abbott and DiaSorin <lb/>systems with an r <lb/> 2 of 0.96 (fig. 2A) despite a mean quantification difference of -0.16 log 10 IU/mL (95% <lb/>CI: -0.19; -0.14) throughout the quantification range (fig. 2B). The results provided by the Liaison-XL <lb/>were constantly and significantly lower than those by the Architect assay (p=0.04). <lb/> Characteristics of patients carrying both HBsAg and anti-HBs <lb/> Among 2578 chronic HBsAg carriers followed between 2008 and 2012, 129 (5%) patients were <lb/>concomitantly HBsAg/anti-HBs positive and 62 (2.4%) were included in the study (fig. 1). Except from <lb/>above mentioned inclusion criteria, available stored sample volume also restricted inclusion into the <lb/>study. The main characteristics of the patients selected for the principal and molecular studies are <lb/>summarized in table 1. Noteworthy, most of the samples had an anti-HBs concentration lower than 50 <lb/>IU/L (median: 24 IU/L) but 31 (30.7%) and 14 (13.9%) had values above 50 and 100 IU/L, <lb/>respectively. No correlation was found between the concentration of HBsAg and anti-HBs (data not <lb/>shown). The median viral load of the patients selected for S-gene sequencing was 3.6 log IU/mL; the <lb/>best performance for sequencing being usually obtained above 1000 IU/mL. <lb/> Qualitative analysis of the HBsAg results obtained with the three assays <lb/> Concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs reactivity was confirmed unequivocally with the three techniques for <lb/>65 % of the 101 samples (table 2). The concordance between all techniques was better for HBsAg <lb/>than for anti-HBs. Noteworthy, the median anti-HBs values obtained with Abbott for concordant (32.5 <lb/>IU/L; IQR 69.4) versus discordant (19 IU/L; IQR 21.8) results were statistically different (p=0.01). <lb/>The HBsAg discordant samples (1 for DiaSorin and 2 for Roche) belong to the same patient who was <lb/>followed at several visits and had persistently very low HBsAg levels: 0.07 and 0.05 IU/mL on <lb/>

			<page> 7 <lb/></page>

			Architect (table 3). Noteworthy, a third sample with a value of 0.1 IU/mL with Abbott was correctly <lb/>detected with Roche and DiaSorin, respectively at 0.041 UI/mL and 0.057 IU/mL. <lb/> Quantitative analysis of HBsAg results obtained with the three assays <lb/> All HBsAg positive data for HBsAg/anti-HBs samples were considered in the quantitative assessment <lb/>of these assays. <lb/>The overall correlation of all assays was satisfactory with r <lb/> 2 ranging from 0.93 for DiaSorin (n=100) <lb/>and Roche (n=99) to 0.97 for Abbott and Roche assays (fig. 3). The best concordance was obtained <lb/>between Roche and Abbott with a mean bias of 0.022 log IU/mL (95% CI: -0.024 to 0.067) in favor of <lb/>Roche while the most divergent quantification was observed between DiaSorin and Roche (bias of <lb/>0.130 log IU/mL in favor of Roche with 95% CI from 0.048 to 0.212). The mean bias between Architect <lb/>and Liaison-XL was -0.113 log IU/mL; the lower values being reported by DiaSorin. A comparison of <lb/>the biases was performed between samples concordant for the detection of both Ag and Ab on all <lb/>techniques (n=66) to the discordant ones (n=33); no statistically significant difference was observed <lb/>according to the discordant status. <lb/> Quantitative analysis of the results obtained with the three assays for anti-HBs antibodies <lb/> To limit any bias, only samples reactive (anti-HBs &gt; 10 IU/L) with the three techniques (n=68) were <lb/>taken into consideration for this analysis. Each technique value was compared to the obtained mean <lb/>value on the three techniques. The best correlation was obtained with DiaSorin assay (R2 = 0.81). The <lb/>mean differences (95% CI) to the mean for Abbott, DiaSorin and Roche were, -18.9 (-31 to -6.8); 21.2 <lb/>(8.4 to 33.9) and -2.30 (-12.1 to 7.5) IU/L, respectively (data not shown). <lb/> Variability of HBsAg quantification according to genotypic features <lb/> Thirty one samples could be sequenced for genotype determination and HBsAg substitution analysis <lb/>(table 1). Ten genotype C, 8 D, 7 E, 4 B, and 1 each genotype A and F were detected. To compare <lb/>HBsAg quantification between all techniques, the mean value obtained by the 3 techniques for each <lb/>sample was calculated. Then, the percentage of HBsAg quantification over the mean was calculated <lb/>for each technique and analyzed according to the genotype or the presence of substitution. <lb/>

			Sequence analyses showed that 77% (24/31 cases) of the HBsAg/anti-HBs samples harbored amino <lb/>acid substitutions on residues 100-221. Substitutions previously described to modify HBsAg <lb/>antigenicity were closely examined (23). Forty five percent (n=14) of the strains had such <lb/>substitutions, with the following amino-acid changes: sT126I (n=3), sQ129G (n=1), sG130N (n=1), <lb/>sN131H (n=1), sF134S (n=1), sC137S (n=1), sS143L (n=3), sG145R (n=2) (table 4). The most <lb/>described sG145R substitution was detected in 2 cases (6%). All but one genotype D strains carried S <lb/>substitution, while only 3 (30%) variants were found among the 10 genotype C strains. <lb/>Quantification differences between the three assays according to genotype and &quot;a&quot; determinant <lb/>substitutions were specifically analyzed on the three systems (figure 4 and 5). Although the size of our <lb/>population was limited, we found a slight influence of HBV genotype on HBV quantification whatever <lb/>the considered technique. Regarding the &quot;a&quot; determinant substitutions, Roche and DiaSorin <lb/>techniques seemed to be the most affected. Noteworthy, all variants were correctly detected but <lb/>DiaSorin tended to underestimate the variant concentration while Roche gave higher than expected <lb/>values. <lb/> DISCUSSION <lb/> HBsAg concentration measurement has become a clinically relevant marker in addition to the well <lb/>standardized panel of serological and molecular markers. As for HBV viral load, standardization of <lb/>both the measurement unit and the techniques is mandatory to provide clinicians with comparable <lb/>quantitative HBsAg values whatever the utilized method. Both Roche and Abbott HBsAg quantification <lb/>techniques have been extensively studied with the conclusion that both techniques are overall very <lb/>comparable and can be used indifferently to monitor patients (18,19,24). By contrast, the newest <lb/>DiaSorin assay has only been studied in two small studies comparing its performance to the Abbott <lb/>system (21,25). Our study first confirms these previous results and indicates that the Architect values <lb/>are always 0.16 log IU/mL higher than those from the Liaison-XL. From all published studies, one may <lb/>conclude that a patient could be followed indifferently with Abbott or Roche assay but an adjustment <lb/>may be required if the Liaison-XL is used during follow up. <lb/>Simultaneous detection of both HBs Ag and Ab is often puzzling in clinical situations. Indeed, although <lb/>this peculiar profile has been described by several authors in different settings, one may wonder <lb/>whether it corresponds to a true analytical observation (3–5,26–29). Overall, we show that the <lb/>

			<page> 9 <lb/></page>

			 qualitative agreement is 65% for the coexistence of both Ag and Ab, providing a strong argument that <lb/>these detections are not a simple artifact. These data are comparable to the 78.6% concordance rate <lb/>reported in a small study using only two first generation qualitative assays (30). Each of these <lb/>techniques uses different combination of Ag and antibodies in different format and confirmation by <lb/>three independent techniques is reassuring. According to our experience, Ag/Ab samples may <lb/>sometimes pose problem when performing an HBsAg neutralization assay as proposed by <lb/>manufacturers. One should stress that a thorough selection was performed in our population to not <lb/>include clinical situations where such profiles may simply be a consequence of therapeutic <lb/>interventions. Indeed, coexistence of both Ag and Ab markers is common during HBV reactivation <lb/>(occurrence of HBsAg in a patient with resolved HBV infection) or administration of immunoglobulins; <lb/>in these settings coexistence of both markers are usually only transient. In our set of samples, the <lb/>agreement for anti-HBs detection screened by Abbott, is not as convincing as for HBsAg but reach <lb/>86% and 71% with DiaSorin and Roche assays, respectively. In terms of correlation between anti-HBs <lb/>measurement, the results are concordant with what observed on classical samples, anti-HBs positive <lb/>but HBsAg negative (31). Taking into account the mean of the three techniques for anti-HBs <lb/>determination, it should be pointed out that 15.8% (n=16) samples were above 100 IU/L, a threshold <lb/>often considered as highly protective in exposed persons. Yet, it emphasizes the risk of considering <lb/>someone protected against HBV infection if anti-HBs are solely looked for in a screening program; <lb/>obviously, anti-HBs should not be used as a single screening test as it may falsely misdiagnose a <lb/>vaccine status in a patient with an active HBV infection! (32) <lb/>Correlations between HBsAg measurement assays were very satisfactory even in these peculiar sera <lb/>where anti-HBs could potentially interfere with measurement (fig. 3). Astonishingly, all assays showed <lb/>performances very similar to what observed in classical HBsAg positive samples by us and others <lb/>(18,21,24,25,33). The concordance for HBsAg detection was also very strong and only 2 samples at <lb/>the limit of detection by all techniques were not detected on the Elecsys. The above conclusions, <lb/>regarding the lower values obtained on the Liaison-XL, were still valid on these Ag/Ab positive <lb/>samples. One rationale for testing such Ag/Ab samples was the likelihood to artificially enrich our set <lb/>with HBsAg variants (7,34). Actually, variant strains were detected in 77% (24/31) of the samples and <lb/>45% (14/31) of the substitutions could potentially modify HBsAg antigenicity (23). Although our study <lb/>was not primarily designed to demonstrate an influence of HBV genotype on HBsAg quantification and <lb/>

			<page> 10 <lb/></page>

			the tested numbers are rather limited, some unexpected differences between techniques for the most <lb/>represented genotypes, B, C, D and E were observed. This observation is currently being further <lb/>documented in a collaborative study on more samples. Many studies have shown that &quot;a&quot; determinant <lb/>variants were incorrectly detected or quantified by commercially available assays in the past (13). The <lb/>attractive strategy of protein unfolding proposed by DiaSorin did not seem to significantly enhance the <lb/>detection of variants and the Architect system was the less affected by the substitutions present on <lb/>our samples (fig. 5) (25). Noteworthy, the 2 samples carrying the sG145R variant were quantified to <lb/>the same level by all three techniques. Overall, it was not possible to identify a specific protein pattern <lb/>that would particularly affect one technique and the most divergent results were not specifically <lb/>observed for HBsAg variants. <lb/>In summary, this study demonstrates the overall good performance of quantitative assays for HBsAg <lb/>even in patients with coexisting HBs and anti-HBs. Although, the precise reasons for this entity remain <lb/>elusive, confirmation on three techniques tend to prove that a technical artifact is not to be blamed in <lb/>the majority of the cases. The difference observed between techniques should remind us that <lb/>sequential monitoring should ideally be performed with a unique assay even though all techniques <lb/>provide well correlated quantification. <lb/>
