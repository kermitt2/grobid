			<front>The reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on <lb/>estimate of a statistical time delay dynamical system <lb/>Nian Shao * , Jin Cheng † , Wenbin Chen ‡ <lb/>Abstract. In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on <lb/>Wallinga and Lipsitch framework [11] and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system. We use <lb/>the observed data reported in CCDC&apos;s paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval <lb/>of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as <lb/>released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC <lb/>model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth <lb/>rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [9], and the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 is estimated by <lb/>3.25 ≤ R 0 ≤ 3.4 if we simply use R = 1 + r * T c with T c = 7.5, which is bigger than that of <lb/>SARS. Some evolutions and predictions are listed. <lb/>Key words. COVID-19; The reproductive number; Growth rate; Statistical time delay <lb/>dynamical system <lb/></front>

			<body>1 One formula for the distribution of generation interval <lb/>The serial interval distribution presented in the paper &quot;Early transmission dynamics in <lb/>Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected peneumonia&quot; [9] by the researches in Chinese Cen-<lb/>ter for Disease Control and Prevention(CCDC) et al, which is defined as the duration between <lb/>symptom onset insuccessive cases in the transmission chain in Fig.2B of [9]. We assume that <lb/>the distribution is Gamma distribution, i.e., the corresponding probability density function is <lb/>P (t) = <lb/>b n <lb/>Γ(n) <lb/>t n−1 e −bt = <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>5 <lb/>Γ(5) <lb/>t 4 e − 2t <lb/>3 , <lb/>(1.1) <lb/>where the parameters are n = 5 and b = 2 <lb/>3 . So the mean of the distribution is n <lb/>b = 7.5 which is <lb/>exactly equal to the number announced in [9], where they claimed that the mean serial interval <lb/>of COVID-19 is 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19). Besides the mean, comparison of (1.1) with Fig2B <lb/>is more convince. The formula is so beautiful, that we believe it must be true. The other <lb/>distributions are also given in our recent report [10]. <lb/>We think this distribution just as the one of generation interval mentioned in [11]. Now <lb/>we can determine the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 if we know the growth rate r of <lb/></body>

			<body>COVID-19 by <lb/>R c = 1 + rT c , <lb/>(1.2) <lb/>where T c = 7.5 can be obtained from (1.1). Before we discuss how to get the estimate of the <lb/>growth rate r of COVID-19, let us review the elegant framework by Wallinga and Lipsitch [11]. <lb/>2 Wallinga and Lipsitch&apos;s framework <lb/>According to the framework of Wallinga and Lipsitch [11], in order to obtain the reproductive <lb/>number R 0 , some variables and distributions should be known based on the data before we use <lb/>their uniform framework: <lb/>• the growth rate of the epidemic r; <lb/>• the mean generation interval of the infection T c ; <lb/>• or the generation interval distribution of the infection g(t). <lb/>We just mention that the mean generation interval T c is the first moment of the generation <lb/>interval distribution g(t): <lb/>T c = <lb/>∞ <lb/>0 <lb/>tg(t)dt. <lb/>(2.1) <lb/>If r and T c are computed, the value of the reproductive number R 0 can be simply estimated <lb/>through a linear equation([11, 1, 8, 4, 5]): <lb/>R c = 1 + rT c . <lb/>(2.2) <lb/>And if r and g(t) are estimated, R 0 can be computed as <lb/>R g = <lb/>1 <lb/>M (−r) <lb/>, <lb/>(2.3) <lb/>where M (z) is the moment generating function of the distribution g(t): <lb/>M (z) = <lb/>∞ <lb/>0 <lb/>e zt g(t)dt. <lb/>(2.4) <lb/>Wallinga and Lipstch&apos;s processes are simple but powerful, which clearly demonstrate how gener-<lb/>ation intervals shape the relationship between growth rate and reproductive number. Specially, <lb/>if g(t) is Gamma distribution with parameters (b, n) as in [11], then we can have two estimates <lb/>of R 0 , one is by (2.2) <lb/>R Γ,c = 1 + <lb/>nr <lb/>b <lb/>, <lb/>(2.5) <lb/>and the another is by (2.3) <lb/>R Γ,g = 1 + <lb/>r <lb/>b <lb/>n <lb/>. <lb/>(2.6) <lb/>Based on the formula of the generation interval, we know that b = 2 <lb/>3 and n = 5, R Γ,g will be too <lb/>sensitive on r, and we will choose (1.2) to obtain R 0 , and our main focus is to get an accurate <lb/>and stable estimate for the growth rate r. The modified second order approximation to (2.6) is <lb/>also important and has been widely used[11, 6]. <lb/></body>

			<body>In [11], Wallinga and Lipsitch point out that if the epidemic model is assumed to be <lb/>susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered(SEIR) model, then the generation interval distribution <lb/>is Gamma distribution. <lb/>So we can obtain our first conclusion. <lb/>Conjecture 2.1. The epidemic model for COVID-19 is SEIR if CCDC&apos;s data are correct. <lb/>The above conclusion may be interpreted by that CCDC assumed that the epidemic model <lb/>should be SEIR. <lb/>Now we introduce how we can estimate the growth rate r. <lb/>3 Fudan-CCDC model <lb/>Our group has developed some models for the growth rate of COVID-19 (TDD-NCP models <lb/>[2, 13] and Fudan-CCDC models[10]) after Jin suggested to use the time delay model to fit the <lb/>real data [2]. Because of the outstanding agreement with data from CCDC and the estimations <lb/>on the growth rate are very stable, we decide to use the following Fudan-CCDC model. Other <lb/>models also work very well to fit the CCDC data. <lb/>Firstly, Let us introduce some variables: <lb/>• I(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative number of cases in the infected stage at time t; <lb/>• J(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative ones in hospitalization stage at time t; <lb/>• G(t): (the distribution of) the number of infected and isolated but yet diagnosed cases at <lb/>time t. They are infected in fact, but are not confirmed by the hospital, then not appeared <lb/>in the infected list of CCDC; <lb/>• I 0 (t): I 0 (t) = I(t) − J(t) − G(t). <lb/>We further make some assumptions on the transition probability functions f 2 (t), f 3 (t) and f 4 (t): <lb/>• f 2 (t): the transition probability from infection to illness onset; <lb/>• f 3 (t): the transition probability from illness onset to hospitalization; <lb/>• f 4 (t): the transition probability from infection to hospitalization, which can be calculated <lb/>via the convolution of f 2 (t) and f 3 (t). <lb/>We assume the log-normal distribution for f 2 (t) and the Weibull distrubution for f 3 (t)[10], <lb/>and the distribution parameters can be estimated from CCDC by fitting the figures in [9]. In <lb/>particular, two important parameters are used: <lb/>• β: denotes the growth rate, which is exactly the same as r: β = r. <lb/>• : denotes the quarantine strategy, for example, specially, we consider this parameter as <lb/>the isolation rate. Large value of suggests that the government more likes to control the <lb/>spreading of COVID-19. <lb/></body>

			<body>Now we introduce our Fudan-CCDC model: I(t), J(t) and G(t) can be approximated by the <lb/>following (statistical) dynamical system: <lb/>dI <lb/>dt <lb/>= rI 0 (t), <lb/>(3.1) <lb/>dJ <lb/>dt <lb/>= r <lb/>t <lb/>−∞ <lb/>f 4 (t − s)I 0 (s)ds, <lb/>(3.2) <lb/>dG <lb/>dt <lb/>= (t) <lb/>t <lb/>−∞ <lb/>f 2 (t − s)I 0 (s)ds − (t) <lb/>t <lb/>−∞ <lb/>f 4 (t − s)I 0 (s)ds. <lb/>(3.3) <lb/>One can also use the discrete system with each step representing one day just as we have <lb/>implemented in the code: <lb/>I(t + 1) = I(t) + rI 0 (t), <lb/>(3.4) <lb/>J(t + 1) = J(t) + r <lb/>s≤t <lb/>f 4 (t − s)I 0 (s), <lb/>(3.5) <lb/>G(t + 1) = G(t) + (t) <lb/>s≤t <lb/>f 2 (t − s)I 0 (s) − (t) <lb/>s≤t <lb/>f 4 (t − s)I 0 (s). <lb/>(3.6) <lb/>We will fit and estimate appropriate values of β(or r) and based on the cumulative diagnosed <lb/>data from CCDC. Other versions of our Fudan-CCDC model are developing, specially, we are <lb/>considering the stochastic version: that is to take random inputs into account, which is important <lb/>to account for the influences from other regions. In math, we can easily generalize the model <lb/>by random terms such as Brownian motion in the system, meanwhile the parameters have to be <lb/>obtained from the real data. The another important version is to consider the interactions of <lb/>two or more regions, Jin&apos;s group have developed some models based on TTD-NCP model[3, 7]. <lb/>These models will also be developed in need of disease control and prevention. <lb/>The simulation is implemented via Matlab with some additional constraints imposed. Here <lb/>the results are summarized in Table 1 with the real data employed up to Feb 16, 2020. <lb/>Table 1: The growth rate r and the reproductive number R 0 <lb/>r(first strategy) <lb/>R 0 <lb/>r(second strategy) <lb/>R 0 <lb/>Wuhan <lb/>0.2830 <lb/>3.1225 <lb/>0.3100 <lb/>3.3250 <lb/>Hubei(without Wuhan) <lb/>0.2692 <lb/>3.0190 <lb/>0.3166 <lb/>3.3745 <lb/>China(without Hubei) <lb/>0.2720 <lb/>3.0400 <lb/>0.3122 <lb/>3.3415 <lb/>Beijing <lb/>0.3012 <lb/>3.2590 <lb/>0.3038 <lb/>3.2785 <lb/>Shanghai <lb/>0.2995 <lb/>3.2462 <lb/>0.3082 <lb/>3.3115 <lb/>In the Table 1, we use two kind of quarantine strategies introduced below. We are surprised <lb/>that our code can get uniform estimators on the growth rate r and the reproductive number R 0 . <lb/>Two quarantine strategy: We can observe that is distinct for different time stages at the <lb/>different regions. Now we assume two quarantine strategies, one uses the following assumption: <lb/>= <lb/>0 if t &lt; t <lb/>0 otherwise, <lb/>(3.7) <lb/></body>
