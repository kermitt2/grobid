Just as critical is the <lb/>process of gene repression or silencing. Chromatin signatures have allowed for the <lb/>global mapping of enhancer cis -regulatory elements, however, the identification of <lb/>silencer elements by computational or experimental approaches in a genome-wide <lb/>manner are lacking. We present a simple but powerful computational approach to <lb/>identify putative silencers genome-wide. We used a series of consortia data to <lb/>predict silencers in over 100 human and mouse cell or tissue types. We performed <lb/>several analyses to determine if these elements exhibited characteristics expected of <lb/>a silencers. Motif enrichment analyses on putative silencers determined that motifs <lb/>belonging to known transcriptional repressors are enriched, as well as overlapping <lb/>known transcription repressor binding sites. Leveraging promoter capture HiC data <lb/>from several human and mouse cell types, we found that over 50% of putative <lb/>silencer elements are interacting with gene promoters having very low to no <lb/>expression. Next, to validate our silencer predictions, we quantified silencer activity <lb/>using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on 7500 selected elements in <lb/>K562 cells. We trained a support vector machine model classifier on MPRA data and <lb/>used it to refine potential silencers in other cell types. We also show that similar to <lb/>enhancer elements, silencer elements are enriched in disease-associated variants. <lb/>Our results suggest a general strategy for genome-wide identification and <lb/>characterization of silencer elements. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>It has long stood that repressive transcription factors can bind to the promoters of <lb/>genes through silencer elements to inactivate gene expression 1-4 . In 1985, the yeast <lb/>mating type loci revealed that distal silencer elements could control gene expression <lb/>from afar 5 . The role for distal silencer elements in mammals was demonstrated <lb/>shortly thereafter through a silencer element located several kilobases upstream of <lb/>the rat insulin gene 6 . It would be a decade a later before key experiments <lb/>identifying a silencer in the intron of the mouse and human CD4 genes would <lb/>revealed the important role that silencers can play in lineage specificity and cell fate <lb/>determination, as this silencer represses CD4 expression in CD8+ T cells 7,8 . Later <lb/>several studies identified genomic sequences with silencer properties that are <lb/>opposite of enhancers across many species 9-13 . While dozens of mammalian <lb/>silencers have been identified, these elements are largely understudied, possibly <lb/>due to our biased focus on gene upregulation and the clandestine nature of those <lb/>with non-promoter locations. <lb/>Outside of promoter regions, silencers along with enhancers and insulators create a <lb/>complex array of distal cis -regulatory elements. These elements, and the factors that <lb/>bind to them, are important for the nuanced output of RNA levels across cell types. <lb/>Identification of distal cis -regulatory elements and our understanding of the <lb/>regulation of gene expression in mammalian genomes has been greatly facilitated by <lb/>the genome-wide mapping of element-specific histone modifications or transcription <lb/>factors, e.g., histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) distinguishing <lb/>enhancers 14 and CTCF binding to a subset of putative insulators 15 . While the <lb/>presence of repressor sequences within cis -regulatory elements such as promoters <lb/>has recently become more evident by tiling millions of oligos across these regions <lb/>and testing by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) 16 , distinct annotations for <lb/>distal silencer elements in the human and mouse genomes are still missing from our <lb/>cis -regulatory lexicon. <lb/>Our goal was to identify distinct silencer elements distal to the genes they regulate. <lb/>Implementing a simple subtractive analysis approach based on DNase <lb/></body>

			<body>hypersensitive sites (DHS) and known other regulatory elements results in an atlas <lb/>of more than 1.5 million unique putative silencer elements in the human genome and <lb/>a second atlas of ~1 million in the mouse genome. We find that silencers are <lb/>enriched for motifs of known repressive transcription factors, and de novo motifs for <lb/>potential cognate transcriptional repressors. We validated our predictions by <lb/>integration of ChIP-seq data for known repressors, direct silencer interactions with <lb/>repressed target genes, and testing via MPRA. Based on our MPRA data for 7,500 <lb/>putative silencers, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to further <lb/>refine silencer element predictions in the human (and mouse) genomes. Putative <lb/>silencers are often enriched for disease associated variants in expected cell types or <lb/>lineages. These atlases, which will require more intensive study and validation from <lb/>the field, should aid our understanding of gene expression through negative <lb/>regulation of expression. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Simple subtractive analysis approach predicts genome wide putative silencer <lb/>elements <lb/>We devised an efficient simple subtractive analysis (SSA) approach to predict <lb/>genome-wide putative silencer elements ( Fig. 1a ). The potential cis -regulatory <lb/>elements should present in open chromatin. We can generate open chromatin data <lb/>either from DNase-seq (DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing) or from ATAC-seq <lb/>(Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) and other <lb/>cis -regulatory elements data from ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled <lb/>with sequencing) for any cell type or organism. In this SSA approach, we subtract <lb/>enhancers (H3K4me1 peaks), promoters (H3K4me3 peaks), potential insulators <lb/>(CTCF peaks) and active TSS from open chromatin (DHS) and assign the leftover <lb/>(or remaining) DHS as silencers, we term these elements as &quot;putative silencer <lb/>elements&quot;. <lb/>Using this SSA approach we predicted 2,315,105 putative silencer elements in <lb/>human genome spanning across 82 cell types from the Roadmap 17 and ENCODE <lb/></body>

			<body>consortia 18 , and 1,299,866 elements in the mouse genome for 22 cell types from the <lb/>ENCODE consortium 18 ( Fig. 1b,d and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and <lb/>Supplementary Table 1 ). On average ~52,360 elements and ~87,800 elements per <lb/>cell type were identified in human and mouse genomes, respectively. We further <lb/>filtered to identify cell-type specific (unique) putative silencer elements. In total <lb/>1,534,618 unique putative silencers in human cell types and 984,477 unique <lb/>elements are predicted in mouse cell types ( Fig. 1c,e and Supplementary Fig. 1c ). <lb/>The identified putative silencer elements are largely present at intergenic, introns <lb/>and repeat elements of the genome for both human and mouse ( Fig. 1f,g ) and <lb/>located relatively close to gene TSS ( Supplementary Fig. 1d,e ). <lb/>Putative silencer elements are enriched with known repressor TFBS <lb/>Transcription factors (TFs) bind at cis -regulatory elements and regulate gene <lb/>expression in response to external cues. Activator TFs bind at enhancers to enhance <lb/>expression and repressor TFs bind at silencer elements and repress gene <lb/>expression. Based on this notion, we determined whether SSA-predicted silencers <lb/>are enriched with repressor TFBS. We intersected putative silencer elements with <lb/>known repressor TFBS within the same cell type using ChIP-seq data for REST, <lb/>YY1, ZBTB33, SUZ12 and EZH2. We found that 73%, 61%, 49% and 58% of total <lb/>putative silencers in K562, H1, GM12878, HEPG2 cells, respectively, are enriched <lb/>with one of the known repressor TFBS ( Fig. 1h ). This corroborates a likely role for <lb/>the putative silencers in negative regulation of gene expression. <lb/>Characterization of putative silencer elements <lb/>Given the limited availability of ChIP-seq data for transcriptional repressors, we <lb/>performed motif enrichment analysis on all cell types to identify other potential <lb/>binding factors. As expected motifs belonging to REST are highly enriched in <lb/>putative silencers of all 52 tested human cell types from Roadmap ( Fig. 2a,b ). <lb/>Surprisingly, motifs belonging to repressors ZBTB33 and YY1 are only enriched in 9 <lb/>and 3 cell types, respectively. Motifs of USF1, BATF, BACH2, FRA1, ATF3, FOSL2, <lb/>JUN, NRF2, NFE2 and RFX family of TFs are also enriched at silencers of many cell <lb/></body>

			<body>types. Previous studies reported that many of these TFs display repressor activity <lb/>19-22 . <lb/>Next, we explored additional characteristics of the putative silencer elements. DNA <lb/>cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic modification affecting gene <lb/>expression patterns during development and disease. DNA hypermethylation at <lb/>promoters and CpG Islands often results in repression of gene expression and <lb/>hypomethylation results in activation. Similarly, enhancer elements are either largely <lb/>unmethylated or lowly methylated 23,24 . However, a number of transcriptional <lb/>repressors are known to bind methylated DNA 25-27 , suggesting some silencer <lb/>elements would be methylated. We computed the average methylation levels for <lb/>putative silencer elements using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data <lb/>from 17 cell types and found them to largely be in a hypermethylated state ( Fig. 2c <lb/>and Supplementary Fig. 2a ). We also compared the average methylation of active <lb/>enhancers (DHS marked with H3K4me1 + H3K27ac) for corresponding cell types <lb/>and found significantly (P-value &lt; 2.2e-16) lower methylation than at putative <lb/>silencers. Putative silencers are on average 75% methylated compared to 43% <lb/>methylation in active enhancers across the 17 cell types ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). <lb/>Enhancers and promoters can be annotated in the genome based on distinct <lb/>chromatin signatures 28 . Such a chromatin signature for silencers would facilitate <lb/>their genomic localization. To investigate such, we made use of already available <lb/>chromHMM annotations for 52 human cell types from the Roadmap consortium. <lb/>Unfortunately, the majority of the putative silencer elements belong to a largely <lb/>uncharacterized annotation category or lack of known histone mark signal (Quies) <lb/>( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). This uncharacterized category varies from <lb/>21% to 80% across cell types. The next three categories are weak transcription <lb/>(TxWk) and weak Polycomb Repressor Complex (ReprPCWk) followed by <lb/>heterochromatin (Het). While limited, all three categories are consistent features of <lb/>transcriptional repression and some repressor TFs. <lb/></body>

			<body>Lastly, we examined conservation scores to check whether putative silencer <lb/>elements are conserved in vertebrate evolution. We used the 100-way phastCons <lb/>score comparing the human genome to 99 other vertebrate genomes. The computed <lb/>phastCons scores suggest that silencer elements are less or non-conserved across <lb/>species similar to enhancer elements 29 ( Fig. 2e ). The average phastCon score for <lb/>putative silencers is 0.12 where as for active enhancers it is 0.14 across 52 cell <lb/>types. <lb/>Putative silencers interact with inactive and lowly expressed genes <lb/>Previous promoter capture HiC (p-CHiC) studies reported that transcriptionally <lb/>inactive or lowly expressed genes promoters are interacting with uncharacterized <lb/>regions of genome, which suggest that they may act as silencers 30,31 . We <lb/>investigated whether our predicted putative silencer elements are interacting with <lb/>inactive genes. For this analysis we obtained four p-CHiC data sets, two for each in <lb/>human (GM12878 and CD34+ cells) and mouse (mESCs and mouse fetal liver cells <lb/>(FLCs)) cell types 30,31 . We overlapped putative silencer elements with non-baited <lb/>fragments (or promoter interacting fragments) to find their interacting genes. In total, <lb/>we find 19,333 putative silencers are interacting with 19,362 genes in GM12878 cells <lb/>and 11,093 putative silencers are interacting with 11,654 genes in CD34+ cells. We <lb/>find 5,305 and 2,198 inactive genes (with RPKM = 0) are interacting with 13,159 and <lb/>3,719 putative silencers in GM12878 and CD34+ cells, respectively ( Fig. 3a,d and <lb/>Supplementary Fig 3a,b ). An additional set of 6,624 and 4,044 lowly expressed <lb/>genes (with RPKM between &gt;0 and 2) are interacting with 15,038 and 6,879 putative <lb/>silencer elements in GM12878 and CD34+ cells ( Fig. 3a,d and Supplementary Fig <lb/>3a,b ). Furthermore, the overall expression of all genes interacting with putative <lb/>silencers showed significantly lower expression than genes interacting with active <lb/>enhancers in both GM12878 and CD34+ cells ( Fig. 3b,e ). Next, we looked at the <lb/>chromatin states of transcription start sites (TSS) of genes interacting with putative <lb/>silencers categorized into different expression ranges ( Fig. 3c,f ). The majority of <lb/>inactive and lowly expressed gene TSS are uncharacterized with no known <lb/>chromatin mark (Quies: GM -50%; CD34 -53%) and to some extent enriched with <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>weak polycomb repressor complex (ReprPCWk: GM -21%; CD34 -16%), weak <lb/>transcription (TxWk: GM -9%; CD34 -6%), followed by heterochromatin (Het: GM -<lb/>3%; CD34 -3%). These chromatin states might be expected for genes repressed <lb/>through distal silencers. In contrast, highly expressed genes are enriched with active <lb/>TSS (TssA: GM -43%; CD34 -30%) and transcription (Tx: GM -20%; CD34 -30%) <lb/>annotation categories. The fraction of uncharacterized and active TSS are in <lb/>opposing trends with gene expression ( Fig. 3c,f ). <lb/>We repeated the p-CHiC analysis with the mouse data sets and found more <lb/>profound results ( Fig. 3g-j ). Briefly, a total of 13,560 putative silencers are <lb/>interacting with 8,032 genes in mESCs and 3,656 putative silencers are interacting <lb/>with 4,025 genes in FLCs. We find 6,155 and 3,032 genes with RPKM in the range <lb/>of 0-1 are interacting with 11,459 and 3,050 putative silencers in mESCs and FLCs, <lb/>respectively ( Fig. 3g,i and Supplementary Fig 3c,d ). Overall, 80% and 79% of total <lb/>silencer interacting genes are within the expression range of 0-2 in mESCs and <lb/>FLCs, respectively ( Fig. 3g,i and Supplementary Fig 3c,d ). Silencer interacting <lb/>genes showed overall lower expression than enhancer interacting genes in both cell <lb/>types ( Fig. 3h,j ). Altogether, this analysis provides strong evidence for silencer <lb/>activity for the SSA-predicted putative silencer elements. <lb/>Functional validation of putative silencer elements in K562 cells <lb/>Having shown that some putative silencer elements are demonstrating silencer <lb/>activity through the direct interaction with repressed genes, we proceeded to <lb/>functionally validate a subset of putative silencer elements and quantitate their <lb/>activity via massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) using the STARR-seq 32 <lb/>approach in K562 cells ( Fig. 4a ). The human STARR-seq vector utilizes the Super <lb/>Core Promoter (SCP1), which was designed and shown to be stronger than the CMV <lb/>promoter 33 , therefore, the GFP reporter expression should be susceptible to <lb/>detectable decreases in expression. We selected 7,430 putative silencer elements, <lb/>20 known silencer elements 16,34 , 20 known enhancer elements 16 and 20 randomly <lb/>selected regions, which act as a control set ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Oligos were <lb/>designed to span 200nt of the silencer sequences flanked by 15nt adapter <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>sequences and synthesized en masse. Of 7,430 selected putative silencer elements, <lb/>3,705 silencers have at least one TFBS belonging to well-known repressor TFs <lb/>(REST, YY1, ZBTB33, EZH2 and SUZ12) and 3,725 silencers have at least one <lb/>known motif belonging to GATA1, GATA2, GATA3, GATA4, BACH1, BACH2, <lb/>TCF12, SMAD3, FLI1, RUNX1, KLF4, ZFP187, ZNF263, ZBTB7B and GFI1B (actual <lb/>numbers are provided in Supplementary Table 2 ). All of which were reported to <lb/>have repressor activity, while primarily serving as activators 19,35-41 . As expected, <lb/>enhancers showed the highest activity and known silencers the lowest activity, while <lb/>putative silencers and control random regions showed similar level of activity ( Fig. <lb/>4b ). We found 3,817 of the putative silencers (2,230 silencers with known repressor <lb/>TFs status and 1,587 silencers with other TFs status) to have activity less than <lb/>median activity level of control random regions at 10% FDR ( Fig. 4c ). Both <lb/>categories of putative silencers, those with known repressor status and silencers <lb/>with other TFs status, showed significantly lower activity than control random regions <lb/>( Fig. 4d ). We also looked at the distribution of TF status in order to identify strong <lb/>candidate TFBS for potential silencer activity ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Though the <lb/>majority of TFBS showed 50% success rate, TFBS of EZH2, SUZ12, KLF4, RUNX1, <lb/>TCF12, REST and YY1 would be strong candidates indicative of potential silencers. <lb/>Because most known TFBS motifs are obtained from transcriptional activators, we <lb/>also performed a de novo motif analysis. The de novo analysis identified several <lb/>novel TFs motifs. When considering the closest related known motif, these belong to <lb/>REST, YY1 and ZBTB33 ( Fig. 4f) . <lb/>SVM model development and predictions <lb/>Recent studies showed that well-trained support vector machine (SVM) models can <lb/>predict cell-type specific cis -regulatory elements from a given set of nucleotide <lb/>sequences 42,43 . Using a gapped k-mer SVM (gkmSVM) 44,45 , we trained the classifier <lb/>based on MPRA functional validation data to further refine our silencer predictions <lb/>( Fig. 5a ). We chose the top 2,200 putative silencer sequences with lowest activity as <lb/>a positive set and the bottom 2,200 silencers with highest activity as a negative set <lb/>for the gkmSVM model. We trained the gkmSVM model on 80% of the data and <lb/>used the remaining 20% of data for testing the model. We checked the performance <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the model on test data by generating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) <lb/>curve by plotting true positive rate versus false positive rate and the precision recall <lb/>curve (PRC). The model accurately predicted the positive silencers on the test set <lb/>and the model performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC <lb/>curve is 0.795 and for PRC is 0.797 ( Fig. 5b,c ). We then used the model for <lb/>predicting potential silencers across all cell types from the list of human <lb/>SSA-predicted putative silencers. We chose the threshold for the gkmSVM score <lb/>where the model&apos;s accuracy is maximum in order to classify the positive silencers <lb/>from negative ones. The percent of gkmSVM positive predictions range from 28% to <lb/>74% for Roadmap human cell types and it varies from 34% to 78% for ENCODE <lb/>human cell types ( Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Table 3 ). <lb/>Next, we examined whether the SVM-predicted silencers can improve the fraction of <lb/>their interacting genes with expression ranging from 0-2 RPKM compared to <lb/>SSA-predicted silencers. We repeated the same analysis as in the previous section. <lb/>Surprisingly, the SVM-predicted silencers have relatively similar fractions of <lb/>interacting genes with RPKM of 0-2 to total interacting genes as did SSA-predicted <lb/>silencers in both GM12878 (61% SVM vs 62% SSA) and CD34+ cells (54% SVM vs <lb/>54% SSA) ( Fig. 5f,h and Supplementary Fig 4c,d ). The chromatin status of TSS for <lb/>interacting genes are also similar to what was observed for SSA-predicted silencers <lb/>( Fig. 5g,i ). Overall, the SVM classifier predicted relatively more cell-type specific <lb/>silencers than SSA approach ( Fig. 5j and Supplementary Fig 4a,b ). This may aid <lb/>future detection of cell-specific silencer elements when the entire repertoire of <lb/>annotated elements needed to predict silencers is not available in a given cell or <lb/>tissue type. <lb/>Disease-associated variants are enriched at putative silencer elements <lb/>Several earlier studies showed that disease-associated single nucleotide <lb/>polymorphisms (SNPs) from <lb/>genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are <lb/>prevalent at non-coding regions of the genome, specially at cis -regulatory elements, <lb/>and often in enhancers of cells thought to be associated with the disease 17,46-48 . We <lb/>next investigated whether putative silencer elements were also enriched for <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>disease-associated variants. First, we determined how many SNPs are present at <lb/>silencer elements. For this, we downloaded all disease SNPs from the NHGRI-EGI <lb/>GWAS catalogue. We included both lead SNPs and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium <lb/>(LD) (r2 &gt;= 0.8) for overlap with silencer elements. We found that 19,088 SNPs <lb/>belonging to 1,500 disease traits are present at silencer elements across all cell <lb/>types. Next, we examined significant enrichment of specific disease SNPs at <lb/>silencers for each cell type. This analysis resulted in ~25% of these diseases (369 <lb/>out of 1,500) being significantly enriched (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.01, hypergeometric <lb/>test) at silencers for one or more cell types ( Fig. 6a,b ). Next, we asked whether <lb/>these disease SNPs are enriched in relevant disease cell types. As a test case, we <lb/>examined whether enrichment of autoimmune diseases are specific to blood cell <lb/>types ( Fig. 6c ). Indeed, we found multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary <lb/>artery disease, adult asthma, autoimmune hepatitis type 1, and coagulation factor <lb/>levels to be specifically enriched at silencer elements of blood cell types. Overall, <lb/>our results illustrate that putative silencer elements are also enriched with <lb/>disease-associated SNPs similar to other cis -regulatory elements. <lb/>Silencers can act as enhancers in other cell types <lb/>Classic studies of promoter silencers showed that these elements reside next to <lb/>activating sequences 4 . The ability to repress expression can also extend to <lb/>promoter-embedded enhancer elements. For example, an inducible enhancer within <lb/>the promoter of the IFNB gene is held under negative control prior to induction by a <lb/>proximal silencer element 49 . We asked whether identified silencer elements in one <lb/>cell type only act as silencers or can also enhance gene expression, i.e., act as <lb/>active enhancers in other cell types. To verify this, we intersected the putative <lb/>silencer elements from each cell type with active enhancers (overlapping DHS <lb/>marked with H3K4me1 + H3K27ac) of the remaining cell types. Interestingly, we <lb/>found that 25% to 65% of silencer elements from one cell type can act as enhancers <lb/>in at least one other cell type ( Fig. 6d ). For the mouse silencer elements it varies <lb/>from 1% to 55% ( Fig. 6e ). Next, we wanted to verify this feature of silencers acting <lb/>as enhancers by looking at their interacting gene expression distribution. As a test <lb/>case, we overlapped putative silencer elements in GM12878 cells with active <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>enhancer elements of CD34+ cells. We then found enhancer interacting genes in <lb/>CD34+ cells from p-CHiC data as was done for silencer interacting genes in <lb/>GM12878 cells and compared the target gene expression levels in their respective <lb/>cell types. The relative expression of silencer interacting genes in GM12878 cells is <lb/>indeed significantly less compared to the expression of interacting genes in CD34+ <lb/>cells when silencers are acting as enhancers ( Fig. 6f ). Promoter elements <lb/>frequently harbor multiple, yet distinct, regulatory sequences, including the core <lb/>promoter, enhancer elements and silencer elements. Our analysis of putative distal <lb/>silencers elements indicates that a subset can likely function as or are part of the <lb/>same cis -regulatory element as enhancers. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The precise control of gene expression, either activation or repression, is essential <lb/>for changes in cell fate and cellular response to external cues. That control is <lb/>ultimately mediated by cis -regulatory elements in the genome and their cognate <lb/>binding factors. Though silencers have shown to be analogues to enhancers in that <lb/>they can be distal to the genes they regulate and often function in a position-or <lb/>orientation-independent manner 4 , silencers lack a unique chromatin signature to aid <lb/>their genome-wide identification. Here, we developed a simple computational (SSA) <lb/>approach to identify genome-wide putative silencer elements. We find that putative <lb/>silencer elements are enriched with known repressor TFBS and motifs. P-CHiC <lb/>interactions showed that inactive and lowly expressed genes are interacting with <lb/>putative silencer elements. These results strongly support the annotation of silencer <lb/>elements in human and mouse genomes. We acknowledge that this may still be an <lb/>overestimate as we likely have not excluded all possible non-silencer cis -regulatory <lb/>elements in our SSA predictions. These predictions also rely on the annotation of <lb/>DHS in each genome, which are subject to some degree of both false positive and <lb/>false negative calls. <lb/>In order to functionally validate a subset of SSA-predicted silencers, MPRAs were <lb/>performed to test nearly 7500 putative elements. MPRA assays confirmed silencer <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>activity for 51% of tested silencer elements. This validation rate is within the range <lb/>or above what was shown for enhancer validation studies 16,50 . Based on our MPRA <lb/>data, we trained an SVM to refine our silencer predictions, which may serve as a <lb/>more conservative estimate of elements in the respective genomes. However, it is <lb/>susceptible to false negatives due to caveats of in vitro reporter assays. It is also <lb/>feasible that weak silencers were not validated. The SVM classifier did improve the <lb/>cellular specificity of putative silencer elements as has been shown for enhancers <lb/>42-44 , which may aid future predictions when limited data are available. <lb/>The vast majority of disease-associated SNPs are known to occur outside of coding <lb/>regions 51 . Similar to enhancers, we found disease-associated SNPs are also <lb/>enriched at putative silencers of relevant disease cell types or tissues 17 . Mutations <lb/>within silencer elements may provide one means for genes to escape repression in a <lb/>disease-specific manner and have implications for other diseases such as various <lb/>cancers. <lb/>Overall, we find that characteristics of the predicted putative silencers are expected <lb/>of silencer elements and are in contrast to the activating activity of enhancers. The <lb/>catalogue of putative silencer elements presented here across many cell types and <lb/>tissues for human and mouse may serve as a resource that complements the <lb/>ENCODE 18 and Roadmap consortia 17 catalogues for other cis -regulatory elements. <lb/></body>

The CTCF TFBS are <lb/>obtained from CTCFBSDB 2.0 ( http://insulatordb.uthsc.edu/ ) for both human and <lb/>mouse 52 . The gene TSS coordinates were obtained from GENCODE annotations for <lb/>human (GRCh37.p13/hg19) and mouse (GRCm38.p5/mm10) 53 . <lb/>SSA approach <lb/>In the SSA approach we used DNase-seq peaks as open chromatin (DHS), <lb/>H3K4me3 peaks as promoter elements, H3K4me1 peaks as enhancer elements and <lb/>CTCF TFBS as insulator elements and active TSS are defined as 2000 bp upstream <lb/>and 500 bp downstream of TSS of all GENCODE genes. We start with DHS peaks <lb/>and removed DHS overlapping with any of H3K4me1 or H3K4me3 or active TSS or <lb/>CTCF TFBS and the remaining non-overlapping DHS peaks are termed as putative <lb/>silencer elements. We included CTCF TFBS from all cell types during subtractive <lb/>analysis as TFBS are largely shared across cell types. We used bedtools suite for <lb/>genomic subtractive analysis 54 . <lb/></div>
