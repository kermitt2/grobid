			<body>Introduction <lb/>Protein folding is strategically important to cellular function in all organisms. In eukaryotes, secreted, membrane-bound and <lb/>organelle-targeted proteins are typically processed and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1-3 . Intracellular perturbations <lb/>caused by a variety of stressors disturb the specialized environment of the ER leading to the accumulation of misfolded or <lb/>unfolded proteins 4, 5 . Shifts in folding capacity have been associated with diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular <lb/>disorders 4 . Physiological processes such as aging can also influence protein folding. Normally, cells ensure proper protein <lb/>folding using a combination of molecular chaperones, foldases and lectins 1 . However, when proper folding can not be restored, <lb/>unfolded or misfolded proteins are targeted to ER Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathways for processing 3 . If unfolded <lb/>or misfolded proteins continue to accumulate, eukaryotes induce the unfolded protein response (UPR). In mammalian cells, <lb/>UPR is a complex signaling program mediated by three ER transmembrane receptors: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), <lb/>inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase <lb/>(PERK). UPR performs three functions, adaptation, alarm and apoptosis. During adaptation, the UPR tries to reestablish folding <lb/>homeostasis by inducing the expression of chaperones that enhance protein folding. Simultaneously, translation is globally <lb/>attenuated to reduce the ER folding load while the degradation of unfolded proteins is increased. If these steps fail, the UPR <lb/>induces a cellular alarm and apoptosis program. The alarm phase involves several signal transduction events, ultimately leading <lb/>to the removal of the translational block and the down-regulation of the expression and activity of pro-survival factors such as <lb/>the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein. After the alarm phase, cells can undergo apoptosis, although ER stress can also initiate <lb/>autophagy 6-12 . Thus, ER folding homeostasis strongly influences mammalian physiology 5 . <lb/>ER stress and UPR plays an important role in a spectrum of diseases and technological applications 13 . In the context of <lb/>diseases such as diabetes, pancreatic β -cells depend on efficient UPR signaling to meet the demands for constantly varying <lb/>levels of insulin synthesis. Type I diabetes is marked by excessive loss of pancreatic β -cells, while type II diabetes is marked <lb/>by pancreatic β -cell dysfunction. The large biosynthetic load placed on the ER by insulin production in response to blood <lb/>glucose levels, can overwhelm the folding capacity of the ER. This leads to PERK activation and the reduction of protein <lb/>synthesis. In PERK -/-cells, protein synthesis is unresponsive to the stress, leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins <lb/>(e.g. proinsulin) and ultimately cell death. PERK deficient mice are more prone to diabetes and progressive hyperglycemia 14 . <lb/>In type II diabetes, ER stress leads to JNK-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at S307, inhibiting <lb/>insulin action 15 . Nitric oxide (NO), is also a key player in β -cell death in type-I diabetes and vascular complications in type-II <lb/>diabetes. NO depletes ER Ca 2+ leading to ER stress and ultimately apoptosis. Pancreatic β -cells have shown that NO-induced <lb/> apoptosis is CHOP dependent 16 . Thus, ER stress is a critical feature of both type-I and type-II diabetes at the molecular, cellular <lb/>and organismal level. ER stress and UPR function can also be important in cancers. The ER not only acts as the center for <lb/>maturation of proteins, but also as a critical node for oxygen sensing and signaling. In rapidly growing tumors, cells face <lb/>stressors like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation both of which can lead to ER stress and ultimately UPR 17 . Interestingly, the <lb/>connection between hypoxia and UPR is through hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) independent pathways. Hypoxia drives PERK <lb/>activation and the transient phosphorylation of eIF2α 18-20 on a time scale of minutes for anoxia, and much slower for hypoxic <lb/>conditions 20 . Because of their ability to transduce pro-apoptotic signals, both PERK and IRE1 have been explored as potential <lb/>anti-cancer targets. Versipelostatin, a repressor of BiP expression, has been shown to produce anti-tumor activity in MKN-74 <lb/>xenograft mouse models 21 . Enhanced apoptosis has also been observed in BiP-deficient fibrosarcoma cells, and XBP1-and <lb/>PERK-deficient mouse fibroblasts 22-24 . In the context of biotechnology, mammalian hosts, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary <lb/>(CHO) cells, have been used for therapeutic protein production since the mid-1980s 25, 26 . Several current biologics are secreted, <lb/>for example, the monoclonal antibodies (MAb) interferon-γ (IFNγ) or erythropoeitin (EPO) 27 . Thus, ER processing and the <lb/>unfolded protein response are critical to the production of these and many other therapeutic proteins. However, despite its <lb/>importance to both disease and biotechnology, there has been a paucity of mathematical models of UPR in mammalian systems. <lb/>In this study, we developed a population of mathematical models describing the adaptation, alarm, and apoptosis phases <lb/>of the mammalian unfolded protein response. The biological connectivity of the UPR model was assembled following an <lb/>extensive literature review. The dynamics of UPR were modeled using mass action kinetics within the framework of ordinary <lb/>differential equations. An ensemble of models parameters was estimated by minimizing the difference between simulations <lb/>and experimental measurements using multiobjective optimization. The ensemble of model parameters was validated using <lb/>cross-validation. Analysis of the model ensemble suggested the three branches of UPR fired simultaneously. However, the <lb/>importance of each brach as ranked ordered in time; PERK and IRE1 were more important early, while ATF6 was important <lb/>later in the response. The activity of all three branches as coordinated by the molecular chaperone BiP. Model analysis suggested <lb/>that BiP feedback was critical to the overall robustness of the system. Removal of any one branch of BiP feedback, destabilized <lb/>the other branches. On the other hand, removal of all nodes of BiP feedback increased the overall robustness of the system. <lb/>Thus, while BiP feedback is crucial to allowing the cell to adapt to small perturbations, it also makes the system fragile and <lb/>susceptible to manipulations. The UPR model code and parameter ensemble is available under an MIT software license and can <lb/>be downloaded from http://www.varnerlab.org. <lb/>Results <lb/>Formulation of the UPR network architecture <lb/>The UPR network described the ER folding cycle, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), ER-stress transducer (PERK, IRE1 <lb/>and ATF6) signaling cascades and stress-induced caspase activation (Fig. 1). The network consisted of 636 protein or mRNA <lb/>species interconnected by 1090 interactions (Fig. 1 Inset). Connectivity was formulated from a comprehensive review of the <lb/>primary literature 1-5, 28-34 , and from on-line databases; String-8 35 , NetworKIN 36 and TRANSFAC. Model connectivity was not <lb/>specific to a single cell-line; rather, it was a canonical representation of the pathways involved in monitoring and controlling <lb/>the folding capacity of a generic well-mixed ER compartment. UPR induction was modeled as the release of BiP from the <lb/>ER stress transducers, PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 leading initially to adaptation of the folding cycle and then, subsequently, <lb/>to alarm and apoptosis. The adaption phase of UPR was marked by general translation attenuation, selective transcriptional <lb/>programs for key species like bZIP transcription factor ATF4 37 , cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) 38 , molecular chaperones <lb/>e.g., BiP 39 , and enhanced clearance of accumulated proteins via ERAD. The alarm and apoptosis phases were mediated by <lb/>the induction of CHOP 40 , regulation of Bcl2, Bcl2-antagonist of cell death (BAD) 41 and (TNF) receptor associated factor 2 <lb/>(TRAF2) 34, 42-44 activation (Fig. 1). Model connectivity is available from the GitHub model repository, and is described further <lb/>in the supplementary materials. <lb/>The UPR model recapitulated the adaptation, alarm, and apoptotic phases of UPR <lb/>A population of unknown model parameters was estimated from 33 dynamic and steady state data sets taken from literature <lb/>(Table T1). The residual between model simulations and each of the measurement sets was simultaneously minimized using <lb/>the multiobjective POETs algorithm 45 . A leave-eight-out cross-validation strategy was used to independently estimate the <lb/>training and prediction error over the 33 data sets; we estimated four different model families, where eight of the 33 objectives <lb/>were reserved for validation and 25 were used for model training. Starting from an initial best-fit parameter set (nominal set), <lb/>more than 25,000 probable models were estimated by POETs from which we selected N = 100 models (25 from each training <lb/>family) with a Pareto rank of one or less (from approximately 1200 possible choices). The nominal, training (75 models), and <lb/>prediction (25 models) errors were calculated for each objective (Table T1). Models used for prediction error calculations for a <lb/>particular objective were not trained on that objective. The prediction likelihood was statistically significantly better for 31 <lb/>of the 33 objective functions at a 95% confidence level, compared with random parameter sets generated from the nominal <lb/></body>

            <page>2/S-13 <lb/></page>

			<body>set (Table T1). POETs generated model families that predicted approximately 94% of the training data with a significantly <lb/>higher likelihood than a random control. However, the specific value of any given parameter was likely not well described; the <lb/>coefficient of variation (CV) for the model parameters ranged from 0.5 -1.6, where approximately 65% of the parameters were <lb/>constrained with a CV ≤ 1.0 (supplementary materials Fig. S1). The most constrained parameters involved a wide-array of <lb/>functions e.g., regulation of PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, Calcineurin, BiP, CHOP and ATF6 signaling. However, the least constrained <lb/>parameters involved JNK and apoptosis interactions. POETs identified Pareto fronts between several objectives, e.g., O13×O14, <lb/>O25×O29, O11×O29, and O27×O2, in the training data (Fig. 2). Strong Pareto fronts suggested an inability to simultaneously <lb/>model different aspects of the training data. However, fronts could also result from experimental artifacts, e.g., variation <lb/>between cell-lines, time-scale differences, or from functional relationships in the data. Globally, adaptation and alarm phase <lb/>training constraints conflicted with those involving apoptosis. For example, objectives involving caspase-7 or caspase-9 activity <lb/>conflicted with phosphorylated eIF2α levels. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by activated PERK attenuates translation, which <lb/>decreases the ER folding load. Thus, eIF2α phosphorylation is a key early adaptive event in UPR. On the other hand, caspase-9 <lb/>is a stress-induced death marker activated only after UPR has failed to restore folding homeostasis. Conflicts between these <lb/>early and late phase markers suggested the UPR time scale was perhaps cell-line or perturbation dependent. Next, we compared <lb/>model simulations with measurements of components mediating the three phases of UPR. <lb/>We estimated model parameters using measurements from UPR initiation and the downstream activation of apoptosis <lb/>(Fig. 3). We assumed the action of thapsigargin (Tg), a non-competitive inhibitor of SERCA Ca 2+ transporters, and other <lb/>stress-inducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) was identical; All stress agents led to the dissociation of BiP from the <lb/>ER-stress transducers. The population of UPR models recapitulated the timescale of PERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) as well as <lb/>its downstream signaling activity, for example, the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 3H). The nuclear fraction of ATF4 increased <lb/>from approximately zero (untreated cells) to a maximum value 4 hrs after Tg exposure. While the model ensemble generally <lb/>predicted the correct trend, there was significant error in the early time points for ATF4 (Fig. 3G). The phosphorylation of <lb/>eIF2α by PERK is required for ATF4 activation. Interestingly, when we compared model simulations of p-eIF2α levels <lb/>following Tg (1µM) exposure in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with measurements (O15 46 ), the model correctly <lb/>captured the appropriate behavior. To test the functionality of the ATF6 branch of the UPR model, we compared simulations <lb/>with measurements of cleaved ATF6 in tunicamycin-treated MEFs 47 . ER stress is known to lead to the release of BiP from ATF6. <lb/>Cleaved ATF6 is then translocated to the nucleus where it up-regulates gene expression 48, 49 . Simulations of cleaved ATF6 <lb/>levels following UPR initiation were consistent with measurements (Fig. 3C). Signals from the ER stress transducers converge <lb/>downstream to regulate BiP transcription 50-53 . The ensemble recapitulated the correct trend BiP expression in experiments <lb/>done on HEK293 cells following stress (Fig. 3D) 54 . One of the long-term outcomes of PERK/IRE1 activation is apoptotic cell <lb/>death. The link between UPR and apoptosis occurred through the action of eIF2α, the dual role of the ATF4 transcription factor <lb/>and caspase activation by the IRE1-TRAF2 signaling axis. We constrained model parameters associated with the activation of <lb/>cell-death using measurements of pro/caspase-7 levels, pro/caspase-9 levels, pro/caspase-3 levels, pro/caspase-12 levels and <lb/>PARP cleavage mediated by executioner caspases following treatment with 0.5µM Tg 55 . These experiments were performed in <lb/>Sak2 cells that lacked Apaf-1 protein expression 55 . Thus, the data allowed us to include a non-Apaf-1 mediated stress-induced <lb/>caspase activation pathway into the model. The population of models recapitulated caspase-3 (Fig. 3K) and caspase-9 (Fig. <lb/>3J), as well as cleaved PARP levels (Fig. 3L) following exposure to ER stress-inducers. Interestingly, while PERK activation <lb/>occurred on the timescale of minutes, initiator and executioner caspase activation occurred over 36 hrs. Thus, the population <lb/>of UPR models captured complex signaling events occurring across multiple time scales. Next, we looked at the signal flow <lb/>through the three branches following the induction of ER stress. <lb/>Signal flow analysis suggested the UPR branches fired simultaneously. <lb/>Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that there is a sequential order for firing of the ER stress transducers in UPR. The PERK <lb/>and ATF6 branches are thought to be activated before IRE1 34 and largely promote ER adaptation to misfolding, while IRE1 <lb/>transmits both survival and pro-apoptotic signals. However, analysis of the UPR model ensemble suggested the three branches <lb/>fired simultaneously, and that adaptation, alarm, or apoptosis was the result of counteracting effects of the three UPR signaling <lb/>pathways (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). UPR induction was controlled by manipulation of the generation rate of unfolded or misfolded <lb/>protein (qP) in the ER compartment. Upon induction, initially (t ≤ 1hr) the response was damped, marking the adaptation <lb/>phase of UPR (Fig. 4A). Adaptation was followed by increased IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 activity at t ∼ 1 hr, marking the <lb/>onset of the alarm phase. The alarm phase was followed by a steady state at t ∼ 8-10 hrs, marking the onset of the apoptosis <lb/>phase of UPR (Fig. 4A). Our analysis was substantiated further by looking at the fluxes at different phases of UPR induction <lb/>(Fig. 4B). At P1, there was a marked increase in ATF4 and CHOP activity, ATF6 signaling and unfolded protein sensing and <lb/>degradation by ERAD. These are hallmarks of the adaptation-alarm phase of the UPR response (Fig. 5D). The apoptosis phase <lb/>at P2 (t ≥ 8-10 hrs) was marked by increased BiP regulation, enhanced ATF4 transcriptional activity, increased mitochondrial <lb/>membrane permeability, and increased apoptotic fluxes. On the other hand, if we reduced the load of unfolded protein in the <lb/></body>

			<body>adaptation-alarm phase (P4), the cell recuperated using its ERAD machinery and the regulation of BiP (Fig. 5E-F). Thus, <lb/>following initiation of UPR all three sensor branches were simultaneously activated. However, it was unclear which parameters <lb/>or species controlled the responses of the three branches. We addressed this question using sensitivity and robustness analysis. <lb/>First-order sensitivity coefficients were computed and time-averaged for normal and UPR induced conditions (Fig. 6). <lb/>Infrastructure parameters e.g. nuclear transport, RNA polymerase or ribosome binding were globally critical, independent <lb/>of stress (Fig. 6, black points). Additionally, apoptotic species and parameters were also important, both in the presence and <lb/>absence of UPR (Fig. 6, yellow points). While the majority of parameters and species became more important in the presence <lb/>of stress, we found a band of parameters (Fig. 6, inset) that were differentially important under stressed. The importance of the <lb/>sensor and stress-transducer modules clearly increased in the presence of UPR; approximately 15% of the parameters were <lb/>significantly more important in the presence of stress. These parameters were largely associated with adaptation and processing <lb/>of unfolded or misfolded proteins, e.g., unfolded protein degradation, cleaved ATF6-induced gene expression, IRE1-TRAF2 <lb/>mediated apoptosis regulation, and RCAN1 regulation. Sensitivity analysis conducted over discrete two hour time windows <lb/>revealed the time evolution of the importance of UPR network modules (Fig. 6). Comparison of the 0 -2 hrs time window <lb/>with itself (top panel, first column of Fig. 6), supported the earlier results that infrastructure components were globally critical <lb/>followed by ERAD species. These species remained important in all time windows. On the other hand, during the initial 0 -2 <lb/>hrs window, ER stress transduction pathway components were robust. Comparison of the 0 -2 hrs time window with later time <lb/>points (working down the first column, Fig. 6), showed the increasing importance of different modules as a function of time. <lb/>For example, components of the PERK and IRE1 modules were more important in the 2 -4 hrs window compared to the earlier <lb/>time points, while alarm and apoptotic phase species were more important in the 6 -8 hrs window compared to the earlier <lb/>time points. Specifically, signal integration via the transcriptional activity of ATF6, ATF4, and XBP1s along with the role of <lb/>RCAN1 and cIAP in apoptosis were significantly more important at 6-8 hrs as compared to 0-2 hrs time window. This was <lb/>consistent with the dominant role of the negative feedback via the transcriptional regulation of BiP in UPR. Interestingly, the <lb/>majority of species rankings were similar after 6 hrs (bottom row, Fig. 6 and supplementary materials Fig. S3). To further <lb/>investigate the role of BiP regulation, we conducted sensitivity analysis upon knocking out the feedback branches of BiP for <lb/>the nominal parameter set (Fig. S4). System performance was robust to any single knockout, however the sensitivity of the <lb/>alternate feedback branches increased. The was most evident following the deletion of the ATF4 feedback. However, sensitivity <lb/>coefficients are only a local measure of how small changes in parameters affect model performance. To better understand the <lb/>response of UPR to a perturbation, we performed robustness analysis. <lb/>Robustness analysis predicted fragile and robust structural perturbations to the UPR network <lb/>Robustness coefficients quantify the response of a protein marker to a macroscopic structural or operational perturbation to <lb/>a biochemical network. We quantified shifts for 636 markers following single parameter knockouts (edge KO), single gene <lb/>knockouts (GKO), and single gene overexpression (GOX) in the presence of ER stress (Fig. 7). Coefficients with values &gt; <lb/>1 (&lt; 1) indicated a marker increased (decreased) compared to the basal state, while a value ∼ 1 indicated approximately no <lb/>change following a perturbation. The cell death program (marked by robustness coefficients for caspase 3) was robust; few <lb/>perturbations increased caspase 3 levels, e.g., overexpression of Procaspases 9/3 (Fig 7 A, Table T2). The robustness of caspase <lb/>3, follwed from the redundant sources of cell death (e.g., APAF-1 dependent and independent pathways). To confirm this, we <lb/>simulated APAF-1 KOs over the entire ensemble (Fig. S6). We found two populations of cells in the ensemble: population 1 <lb/>where APAF-1 was the dominant regulator of cell-death (marked by reduction in caspase 3 upon APAF-1 KO), and population <lb/>2 where APAF-1 was not dominant regulator. This behavior was consistent with the training data from Sak2 cells (APAF-1 <lb/>−ve cells) 55 . Interestingly, manipulation of the pro-survival axis via regulation of Bcl2 was possible (Fig 7A, Table T2). For <lb/>example, deletion of the PERK/ATF4 signaling axes increased Bcl2 levels by removing CHOP repression (Fig. 7A). The direct <lb/>correlation between ATF4 and CHOP was further observed in the ATF4-CHOP phenotypic plane. Perturbations affecting ATF4 <lb/>affected CHOP levels in the same manner (Fig. 7A-B). However, owing to redundant sources of CHOP regulation (e.g., via <lb/>XBP1s), effect on CHOP was damped in relation to significant changes in ATF4 levels. In the XBP1s-CHOP plane, we see at <lb/>lower levels of XBP1s and CHOP, there is a direct relation between XBP1s levels and CHOP levels. However, there exists very <lb/>few strategies of having both high XBP1s levels and CHOP levels indicating that higher XBP1s doesn&apos;t necessarily mean higher <lb/>CHOP levels. To further investigate the implications of the feedback regulation of BiP via ATF4/ATF6/XBP1s, we simulated <lb/>KOs of these components over the entire ensemble (data not shown). Upon knockout of BiP feedback, BiP regulation was <lb/>found to be very strong resulting in drastic reductions in BiP levels and ultimately a stronger and faster UPR response (Fig. S7). <lb/>Clustering of the gene knockout robustness coefficients provided systems-level insight into UPR (Fig. 7C). The most <lb/>distinct separation was between the ATF6 and IRE1/PERK branches. PERK/ATF4 plays a dominant role in the regulation <lb/>of BiP and CHOP upon the onset of UPR. Similarly, the IRE1/TRAF2 signaling axis induced apoptosis. Another interesting <lb/>functional module was that of CHOP, involving p38MAPK which leads to down-regulation of Bcl2 levels which considerably <lb/>affects the apoptosis module. We computed the magnitude of the orthogonal components, which was used to establish the <lb/></body>

			<body>uniqueness of a single gene knockout (Fig. 7C Inset). BiP, Procaspase 9, IRE1, PERK and TRAF2 knockouts produced the <lb/>most unique effects. This was supported by the critical role of BiP in initiating and regulating the time scale of the UPR <lb/>response. PERK (via ATF4) plays a key role in the regulation of BiP, thus its uniqueness. Similarly, the regulation of the <lb/>apoptosis branch via IRE1-TRAF2 and Procaspase 9 were the amongst the most unique. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we developed a population of mathematical models describing the adaptation, alarm, and apoptosis phases <lb/>of the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR). Proteins requiring post-translational modifications such as N-linked <lb/>glycosylation or disulfide bond formation are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A diverse array of cellular stresses <lb/>can lead to dysfunction of the ER, and ultimately to an imbalance between protein-folding capacity and protein-folding load. <lb/>Unfolded or misfolded proteins are tagged for degradation via ER associated degradation (ERAD) or sent back through the <lb/>folding cycle. Continued accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins can also trigger UPR. PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), <lb/>inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were modeled as the key UPR initiators. While <lb/>UPR has been extensively studied 1-5, 28-34 , a detailed mathematical model of this important system has not been developed. <lb/>The UPR network architecture used in the model was based on extensive review of the literature (supplementary materials). <lb/>Mass balance equations describing 636 species interconnected by 1090 interactions were formulated using mass-action kinetics <lb/>within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. Four model populations were estimated using multi-objective <lb/>optimization (33 objective functions) in conjunction with a leave-eight out cross-validation strategy using POETs 45 . These <lb/>model populations were then analyzed using population-based sensitivity and robustness analysis. <lb/>A key finding of our study was that the overall outcome of UPR was as a result of simultaneous firing and competition <lb/>between signaling mediated by the three ER-stress transducers: PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. This is in contrast to the traditional <lb/>belief that PERK and ATF6 branches are activated before IRE1 34 . So what we hypothesize is that instead of a sequential <lb/>ordering of these branches, the state of the cell in terms of adaptation, alarm, or apoptosis is a result of counteracting effects of <lb/>these three prongs of UPR signaling. The counteracting/competing effects were further substantiated in simulated knockout <lb/>studies, wherein knockout of one ER stress transducer led to enhancement of the other branches of UPR. Signal transduction <lb/>architectures frequently contain redundancy, feedback, and crosstalk. These topological features ensure signal propagation <lb/>is adaptable, efficient, and robust. However, they also make reprogramming signal flow challenging. This was highlighted <lb/>remarkably in the case of UPR. Signals from the three ER-stress transducers converged at the level of up-regulation of BiP. This <lb/>is the key junction which regulates the three stages (onset and time) of adaptation, alarm, and apoptosis. In this regard, regulators <lb/>of this feedback cleaved ATF6, ATF4, and XBP1s and were seen as highly sensitive components of UPR. Interestingly these <lb/>components put-together increased the overall fragility of the system and presented a greater scope of manipulation of the UPR <lb/>response. This was substantiated by sensitivity analysis upon KO of the feedback loops, where we saw increased stability of the <lb/>UPR module. When these feedback components were knocked out individually, the system overall remained stable thanks to <lb/>increased activity and load sharing via the other feedback branches. Amongst the three components of feedback, we identified <lb/>ATF4 as the key load bearer/regulator. This was substantiated by signal flow, robustness and sensitivity analysis. This is really <lb/>interesting as ATF4 protein has shown to be present in greater levels in cancer compared to normal tissue, and it is up-regulated <lb/>by signals of the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia/anoxia, oxidative stress, and ER stress 56 . So any aberrations in <lb/>regulation of ATF4 could potentially serve as a specific target in cancer therapy. As a target, ATF4 is attractive because it is also <lb/>potentially involved in angiogenesis and adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxia/anoxia, which are major problems in cancer <lb/>progression 56 . <lb/>Downstream effects of UPR range from cellular adaptation/survival (low stress) to the cell committing to apoptosis mediated <lb/>death (high stress). Our modeling analysis suggested that the cell-death phenotype (marked by increased levels of Caspase <lb/>3 as compared to WT) was relatively robust. This robustness could be attributed to redundant routes of APAF-1 dependent <lb/>and APAF-1 independent routes of apoptosis. This claim is supported by experimental evidence in Sak2 cells 55 and as seen <lb/>by our simulated knockout studies where we identified two distinct populations representing clear distinctions in APAF-1 <lb/>dependent and independent routes of apoptosis. Interestingly, manipulation of the pro-survival phenotype (marked by increased <lb/>levels of Bcl2 as compared to WT) was feasible. The most effective route was via manipulation of the PERK/ATF4/CHOP <lb/>branch. This was substantiated by simulated CHOP KO experiments over the entire ensemble, wherein we identified two <lb/>distinct populations within the ensembles. One with a strong effect of CHOP mediated down-regulation of Bcl2 (marked by ∼ <lb/>10 fold increase in Bcl2 levels) and the other with very little effect of CHOP on Bcl2 levels. This complex network behavior <lb/>could be attributed to other conflicting means of regulation of Bcl2 levels. Rightfully so, induction of CHOP is involved in <lb/>the development of various diseases and several therapeutic interventions 57 . For instance, suppression of CHOP by RNA <lb/>interference, decoy oligodeoxynucleotides or drug inhibitors have a significant therapeutic potential to modulate type I diabetes <lb/>and brain ischemia. On the other hand, overexpression of CHOP may represent a new class of anticancer therapy. Since <lb/>induction of BiP has been observed in a variety of tumor cells, overexpression of CHOP directed by the BiP promoter may be <lb/></body>

			<body>used as a highly specific therapy for cancer 57 . Model analysis also highlighted the essential role of RCAN1 and IRE1-TRAF2 <lb/>routes of apoptosis. ATF6 induces regulation of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) expression 31 . RCAN1 sequesters calcineurin 31 , a <lb/>calcium activated protein-phosphotase B, that dephosphorylates Bcl2-antagonist of cell death (BAD) at S75 or S99 41 . This <lb/>leads to sequestering of Bcl2 by BAD, which inhibits its downstream anti-apoptotic activity 41 . Recently, a number of ATF6 <lb/>homologs have been identified, e.g., OASIS, CREBH, LUMAN/CREB3, CREB4, and BBF2H7 that are processed in a similar <lb/>way as ATF6, yet their function remains unknown 58 . Thus, ER-stress induced ATF6 signaling may be responsible for additional <lb/>undiscovered functionality. <lb/>We generated insights and presented falsifiable hypothesis regarding the UPR program using mathematical modeling. While <lb/>we did an extensive literature search to formulate the model, we are likely missing key structural interactions in the UPR <lb/>interaction network. First, we are missing the negative regulation of the three ER-stress transducers. Given PERK&apos;s central role <lb/>in translation attenuation, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to regulate PERK activity 59 . The cytosolic kinase domain <lb/>of PERK can be inhibited by the action of the DNAJ family member P58 IPK . P58 IPK was initially discovered as an inhibitor <lb/>of the eIF2α protein kinase PKR 59 . P58 IPK , whose expression is induced following ATF6 activation, binds to the cytosolic <lb/>kinase domain of PERK, inhibiting its activity 60, 61 . Inhibition of PERK kinase activity relieves eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby <lb/>removing the translational block. Interestingly, P58 IPK expression occurs several hours after PERK activation and eIF2α <lb/>phosphorylation. Thus, P58 IPK induction may mark the end of UPR adaptation, and the beginning of the alarm/apoptosis phase <lb/>of the response 34 . Second, PERK induces a negative feedback loop, through its downstream effector CHOP, involving the <lb/>de-phosphorylation of eIF2α. CHOP induces the expression of GADD34 which, in conjunction with protein phosphatase 1 <lb/>(PP1), assembles into a phosphatase which dephosphorylates the S51 residue of eIF2α 62 . GADD34 is a member of the GADD <lb/>family of genes which are induced by DNA damage and a variety of other cellular stresses 63 . The GADD34 binding partner in <lb/>this complex appears to be responsible for PP1α recognition and targeting of the phosphatase complex to the ER. Association <lb/>between GADD34 and PP1 is encoded by a C-terminal canonical PP1 binding motif, KVRF, while approximately 180 residues <lb/>near the N-terminus of GADD34, appear to be responsible for ER localization 64 . Next, little is known about deactivation of <lb/>ATF6. Recently, XBP1u, the unspliced form of XBP1, has been implicated as a negative regulator for ATF6 65 . In the recovery <lb/>phase following ER stress, high levels of XBP1u may play a dual role by promoting degradation 66, 67 , and binding of ATF6α <lb/>rendering it prone to proteasomal degradation 65 . Lastly, we should revisit the regulation of IRE1α activity. IRE1α activity is <lb/>regulated by several proteins, including tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), ASK1-interactive protein 1 (AIP1) and members <lb/>of the Bcl2 protein family. Members of the HSP family of proteins have also been shown to regulate IRE1α. For example, <lb/>HSP90 interacts with the cytosolic domain of IRE1α, potentially protecting it from degradation by the proteasome 68 . HSP72 <lb/>interaction with the cytosolic IRE1α domain has also recently been shown to enhance IRE1α endoribonuclease activity 69 . <lb/>These missing structural connections could be important to fully understanding and manipulating UPR. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Formulation and solution of the model equations <lb/>The unfolded protein response model was formulated as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs): <lb/>dx <lb/>dt <lb/>= S • r (x, p) <lb/>x (t o ) = x o <lb/>(1) <lb/>The symbol S denotes the stoichiometric matrix (636 × 1090). The quantity x denotes the concentration vector of proteins or <lb/>protein complexes (636 × 1). The term r (x, p) denotes the vector of reaction rates (1090 × 1). Each row in S described a protein <lb/>or protein-protein complex, while each column described the stoichiometry of network interactions. Thus, the (i, j) element of <lb/>S, denoted by σ i j , described how protein i was involved in rate j. If σ i j &lt; 0, then protein i was consumed in r j . Conversely, if <lb/>σ i j &gt; 0, protein i was produced by r j . Lastly, if σ i j = 0, there was no protein i in rate j. All of these interactions were obtained <lb/>from the literature (supplemental materials). We assumed mass-action kinetics for each interaction in the network. The rate <lb/>expression for interaction q was given by: <lb/>r q (x, k q ) = k q ∏ <lb/>j∈{R q} <lb/>x <lb/>−σ jq <lb/>j <lb/>(2) <lb/>The set R q denotes reactants for reaction q while σ jq denotes the stoichiometric coefficient (element of the matrix S) <lb/>governing species j in reaction q. All reversible interactions were split into two irreversible steps. The mass-action formulation, <lb/>while expanding the dimension of the UPR model, regularized the mathematical structure. Parameters were one of only three <lb/>types: association, dissociation, or catalytic rate constants. Thus, although mass-action kinetics increased the number of <lb/>parameters and species, they reduced the complexity of model analysis. In this study, we considered well-mixed nuclear, <lb/>cytosolic, and extracellular compartments. Unfolded protein response conditions were simulated by running the model to steady <lb/></body>

            <page>6/S-13 <lb/></page>

            <body>state and then providing a dose of unfolded protein. The steady-state was estimated numerically by repeatedly solving the <lb/>model equations and estimating the difference between subsequent time points: <lb/>x (t + ∆t) − x (t) 2 ≤ γ <lb/>(3) <lb/>The quantities x (t) and x (t + ∆t) denote the simulated concentration vector at time t and t + ∆t, respectively. The L 2 vector-<lb/>norm was used as the distance metric. We used ∆t = 1 s and γ = 0.001 for all simulations. The model equations were solved <lb/>using the LSODE routine in OCTAVE (www.octave.org) on an Apple workstation (Apple, Cupertino, CA). The UPR model <lb/>code and parameter ensemble is available under an MIT software license and can be downloaded from http://www.varnerlab.org. <lb/>Estimation and cross-validation of a population of UPR models <lb/>POETs is a multiobjective optimization strategy which integrates several local search strategies e.g., Simulated Annealing (SA) <lb/>or Pattern Search (PS) with a Pareto-rank-based fitness assignment 45 . Let k i+1 denote a candidate parameter set at iteration <lb/>i + 1. The squared error for k i+1 for training set j was defined as: <lb/>E j (k) = <lb/>T j <lb/>∑ <lb/>i=1 <lb/>M i j −ŷ i j (k) <lb/>2 <lb/>(4) <lb/>The symbolM i j denotes scaled experimental observations (from training set j) while the symbolŷ i j denotes the scaled <lb/>simulation output (from training set j). The quantity i denotes the sampled time-index and T j denotes the number of time <lb/>points for experiment j. The read-out from the training immunoblots was band intensity where we assumed intensity was only <lb/>loosely proportional to concentration. Suppose we have the intensity for species x at time i = {t 1 ,t 2 , ..,t n } in condition j. The <lb/>scaled measurement would then be given by: <lb/>M i j = <lb/>M i j − min i M i j <lb/>max i M i j − min i M i j <lb/>(5) <lb/>Under this scaling, the lowest intensity band equaled zero while the highest intensity band equaled one. A similar scaling was <lb/>defined for the simulation output. <lb/>We computed the Pareto rank of k i+1 by comparing the simulation error at iteration i + 1 against the simulation archive K i . <lb/>We used the Fonseca and Fleming ranking scheme 70 : <lb/>rank (k i+1 | K i ) = p <lb/>(6) <lb/>where p denotes the number of parameter sets that dominate parameter set k i+1 . Parameter sets on or near the optimal trade-off <lb/>surface have small rank. Sets with increasing rank are progressively further away from the optimal trade-off surface. The <lb/>parameter set k i+1 was accepted or rejected by the SA with probability P (k i+1 ): <lb/>P(k i+1 ) ≡ exp {−rank (k i+1 | K i ) /T } <lb/>(7) <lb/>where T is the computational annealing temperature. The initial temperature T o = n/log(2), where n is user defined (n = 4 for <lb/>this study). The final temperature was T f = 0.1. The annealing temperature was discretized into 10 quanta between T o and T f <lb/>and adjusted according to the schedule T k = β k T 0 where β was defined as: <lb/>β = <lb/>T f <lb/>T o <lb/>1/10 <lb/>(8) <lb/>The epoch-counter k was incremented after the addition of 100 members to the ensemble. Thus, as the ensemble grew, the <lb/>likelihood of accepting parameter sets with a large Pareto rank decreased. To generate parameter diversity, we randomly <lb/>perturbed each parameter by ≤ ±25%. We performed a local pattern-search every q steps to minimize the residual for a single <lb/>randomly selected objective. The local pattern-search algorithm has been described previously 71, 72 . The parameter ensemble <lb/>used in the simulation and sensitivity studies was generated from the low-rank parameter sets in K i . <lb/>We simultaneously calculated training and prediction error during the parameter estimation procedure using leave-eight-out <lb/>cross-validation 73 . The complete set of training data (33 objectives) was subdivided into four bins; in each bin 25 data sets <lb/>were reserved for training while eight were reserved for prediction. In the first bin DS 1 . . .DS 8 were used for validation while <lb/>DS 9 . . .DS 33 were used for training. In the second bin DS 9 . . .DS 16 were used for validation while DS 1 . . .DS 8 DS 17 . . .DS 33 <lb/>were used for training, etc. Thus, we formulated four ensembles from which we evenly selected parameter sets for the parent <lb/>ensemble. While cross-validation required that we generate additional model populations, we trained and tested against all the <lb/>data sets. <lb/></body>

            <page>7/S-13 <lb/></page>

            <body>Sensitivity and robustness analysis of the population of UPR models. <lb/>Sensitivity coefficients were calculated as shown previously 45 using five models selected from the ensemble (red points, <lb/>supplementary materials Fig. S1). The resulting sensitivity coefficients were scaled and time-averaged (Trapezoid rule): <lb/>N i j ≡ <lb/>1 <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>0 <lb/>dt • |α i j (t) s i j (t)| <lb/>(9) <lb/>where T denotes the final simulation time and α i j = 1. The time-averaged sensitivity coefficients were then organized into an <lb/>array for each ensemble member: <lb/>N (ε) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>11 <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>12 <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>1 j <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>1P <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>21 <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>22 <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>2 j <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>2P <lb/>. . . <lb/>. . . <lb/>. . . <lb/>. . . <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>M1 <lb/>N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>M2 <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>M j <lb/>. . . N <lb/>(ε) <lb/>MP <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>ε = 1, 2, . . . , N ε <lb/>(10) <lb/>where ε denotes the index of the ensemble member, P denotes the number of parameters, N ε denotes the number of ensemble <lb/>samples and M denotes the number of model species. To estimate the relative fragility or robustness of species and reactions in <lb/>the network, we decomposed the N (ε) matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): <lb/>N (ε) = U (ε) Σ (ε) V T,(ε) <lb/>(11) <lb/>Coefficients of the left (right) singular vectors corresponding to largest β singular values of N (ε) were rank-ordered to estimate <lb/>important species (reaction) combinations. Only coefficients with magnitude greater than a threshold (δ = 0.1) were considered. <lb/>The fraction of the β vectors in which a reaction or species index occurred was used to rank its importance. <lb/>Robustness coefficients of the form: <lb/>α i, j,t o ,t f = <lb/>t f <lb/>t o <lb/>x i (t) dt <lb/>−1 <lb/>t f <lb/>t o <lb/>x <lb/>( j) <lb/>i (t) dt <lb/>(12) <lb/>were calculated to understand the robustness of the network. The robustness coefficient α i, j,t o ,t f is the ratio of the <lb/>integrated concentration of a network marker in the presence (numerator) and absence (denominator) of structural or operational <lb/>perturbation. The quantities t 0 and t f denote the initial and final simulation time respectively, while i and j denote the <lb/>indices for the marker and the perturbation respectively. If α i, j,t o ,t f &gt; 1, then the perturbation increased the marker <lb/>concentration. Conversely, if α i, j,t o ,t f <lb/>1 the perturbation decreased the marker concentration. Lastly, if α i, j,t o ,t f ∼ 1 <lb/>the perturbation did not influence the marker concentration. <lb/>Clustering and identification of distinguishable species <lb/>A dendrogram was derived by considering each of the knockouts(over-expressions) as variables and the average log of robustness <lb/>coefficient (LRC) for each of the species as observations. We used the Euclidean norm in LRC space as the distance metric. <lb/>The linkage function (objective function for identifying variable clusters) was the inner squared distance (minimum variance <lb/>algorithm). The Statistical Toolbox of Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to generate the distances, linkages, and <lb/>the final dendrogram. <lb/>Robustness coefficients were used to rank-order knockout (overexpression) experiments in terms of the greatest unique <lb/>responses and identify species which were linearly distinguishable. The response of the knockout (overexpression) was <lb/>measured in terms of the robustness coefficients. The LRC had desirable linear properties, such that no response (no change in <lb/>trajectories from wild-type) returns a value of zero and similar negative and positive responses have different directions but <lb/>similar magnitudes. We considered the unique component of the response to be the orthogonal component in LRC space and the <lb/>magnitude of the response to be the Euclidean norm. The orthogonal components and there magnitude were identified for each <lb/>parameter set in the ensemble by first choosing the knockout (overexpression) with the greatest magnitude, x 1 and placing it in <lb/>the empty set V . The knockout (overexpression) x 1 defines the orthogonal directions in the LRC space. We then calculated the <lb/>orthogonal components for all remaining knockouts(overexpressions) relative to x 1 , and added the knockout (overexpression) <lb/>species with the greatest orthogonal magnitude to set V . In general the components of all remaining x i orthogonal to set V were <lb/>calculated and the largest was moved into set V . This process was continued until all knockout (overexpression) species, x i <lb/>were added to set V . Mathematically two species were considered distinguishable if and only if they were linearly independent <lb/>(the orthogonal components were non-zero). We considered a threshold value of one or five and performed a student t-test <lb/>(Matlab Statistical Toolbox, The Mathworks, Natick, MA) to identify which species had orthogonal components above the <lb/>threshold with a 95% confidence over the ensemble. <lb/></body>

An array of cellular stressors can perturb the folding environment in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to <lb/>unfolded or misfolded protein. In response to the folding imbalance, cells initiate the cytoprotective unfolded protein response <lb/>(UPR). The problem of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER is addressed by increasing the folding capacity through the <lb/>up-regulation of the expression of chaperone proteins, attenuating translation by regulating eIF2α, and promoting the <lb/>degradation of misfolded proteins through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). If UPR is unable to restore the folding balance, <lb/>ER stress will eventually lead to apoptotic cell-death. The three signal transduction pathways mediating the unfolded protein <lb/>response in higher eukaryotes. First, the PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway is initiated after BiP dissociation from PERK. <lb/>While PERK transduces both pro-and anti-apoptotic signals, its main function is translation attenuation through the <lb/>phosphorylation of eIF2α. Next, the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway is activated following BiP dissociation. <lb/>ATF6 induces the expression of chaperones e.g., BiP as well as apoptosis effectors such as CHOP. Lastly, the inositol-requiring <lb/>kinase 1 (IRE1) pathway is activated following BiP dissociation from IRE1. Activated IRE1 has both an endoribonuclease and <lb/>a serine-threonine kinase activity that drive can pro-apoptotic signals. Inset: The UPR network consisted of 636 protein or <lb/>mRNA species interconnected by 1090 interactions. <lb/></body>

            <div type="annex">Supplemental materials <lb/>Molecular basis of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) <lb/>Protein folding is strategically important to cellular function. Secreted, membrane-bound, and organelle-targeted proteins <lb/>are typically processed and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes 1-3 . Intracellular perturbations caused <lb/>by a variety of stressors disturb the specialized environment of the ER leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins 4, 5 . <lb/>Normally, cells ensure that proteins are correctly folded using a combination of molecular chaperones, foldases, and lectins 1 . <lb/>However, when proper folding can not be restored, incorrectly folded proteins are targeted to ER Associated Degradation <lb/>(ERAD) pathways for processing 3 . If unfolded or misfolded proteins continue to accumulate, eukaryotes induce the unfolded <lb/>protein response (UPR). <lb/>UPR is a complex signaling program mediated by three ER transmembrane receptors: activating transcription factor <lb/>6 (ATF6), inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic <lb/>reticulum kinase (PERK). UPR performs three functions: adaptation, alarm, and apoptosis. During adaptation, the UPR tries <lb/>to reestablish folding homeostasis by inducing the expression of chaperones that enhance protein folding. Simultaneously, <lb/>translation is globally attenuated to reduce the ER folding load while the degradation of unfolded proteins is increased. If <lb/>these steps fail, the UPR induces a cellular alarm and apoptosis program. The alarm phase involves several signal transduction <lb/>events, ultimately leading to the removal of the translational block and the down-regulation of the expression and activity of <lb/>pro-survival factors such as the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein. After the alarm phase, cells can undergo apoptosis, although <lb/>ER stress can also initiate autophagy 6-12 . Thus, ER folding homeostasis strongly influences physiology 5 . Aberrant protein <lb/>folding and UPR have been implicated in a number of pathologies. For example, the onset of diabetes 74 as well as myocardial <lb/>ischaemia, cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and heart failure 75 have all been linked with aberrant folding or UPR signaling. <lb/>The folding cycle, quality control and ER associated degradation (ERAD) <lb/>Newly synthesized polypeptide chains enter the ER through a peptide translocon in the ER membrane composed of four <lb/>proteins, Sec61P (heterortrimeric complex of proteins containing α,β ,γ subunits) and TRAM 76 . Upon entering the ER, these <lb/>nascent chains begin to fold, often as they are being co-translationally modified 77 . The folding quality of proteins in the <lb/>ER is maintained by an in-built quality control (QC) system which ensures proteins are in their native folded state before <lb/>exiting the ER 4, 78 . A protein is correctly folded if it has attained its native conformation after required co-or post-translational <lb/>modifications. On the other hand, exposed hydrophobic regions, unpaired cysteine residues, or aggregation are all markers of <lb/>an unfolded or misfolded conformation 78 , which leads to subsequent retro-translocation to the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, <lb/>these unfolded or misfolded proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system 79 . Hydrophobic unfolded or misfolded <lb/>queues are recognized in the ER by molecular chaperones which bind these queues and increase the probability of correct <lb/>folding 80-82 . For example, the HSP70 family of chaperones recognize, in an ATP-dependent manner, exposed hydrophobic <lb/>patches on a broad spectrum of unfolded or misfolded proteins 3 . Repeated binding and release of HSP70 chaperones ensures <lb/>that incorrectly folded proteins do not exit the ER 3 . One critical member of the HSP70 family is BiP or GRP78. BiP consists <lb/>of an N-terminal ATPase domain and a C-terminal peptide binding domain 83 . BiP also regulates the activation of the three <lb/>transmembrane ER stress transducers: PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. Normally, BiP is bound to these ER receptors, blocking their <lb/>activation. However, in the presence of exposed hydrophobic residues BiP disassociates, allowing PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 <lb/>activation. Overexpression of BiP leads to reduced activation of IRE1 and PERK 84, 85 . The PERK and ATF6 branches are <lb/>thought to be activated before IRE1 34 ; this ordering is consistent with the signals that each branch transduces. The PERK <lb/>and ATF6 pathways largely promote ER adaptation to misfolding, while IRE1 has a dual role, transmitting both survival and <lb/>pro-apoptotic signals. <lb/>Double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway <lb/>The PERK branch of UPR transduces both pro-survival as well as pro-apoptotic signals following the accumulation of unfolded <lb/>or misfolded protein in the ER. PERK is a type I transmembrane protein, composed of a ER luminal stress sensor and a cytosolic <lb/>protein kinase domain. Dissociation of BiP from the N-terminus of PERK initiates dimerization and autophosphorylation of <lb/>the kinase domain at T981 86 . The eIF2α protein, which is composed of three subunits, is critical to translation initiation in <lb/>eukaryotes, including GTP-dependent start-site recognition 87 . Activated PERK can phosphorylate eIF2α at S51 88, 89 , which <lb/>leads to three downstream effects. First, phosphorylated eIF2α globally attenuates translation initiation (Not included in the <lb/>current model). Decreased translation reduces the influx of protein into the ER, hence diminishing the folding load. Translation <lb/>attenuation is followed by increased clearance of the accumulated proteins from the ER by ERAD and expression of pro-<lb/>survival genes. For example, PERK activation induces expression of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) 38 . Interestingly, <lb/>decreased protein translation is not universal; genes with internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences in the 5 untranslated <lb/>regions bypass the eIF2α translational block 28 . One of the most well-studied of these, ATF4, encodes a cAMP response <lb/>element-binding transcription factor (C/EBP) 37 . ATF4 drives the expression of pro-survival functions such as amino acid <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">transport and synthesis, redox reactions, and protein secretion 39 . Taken together, these effects seem to be largely pro-survival. <lb/>However, ATF4 can also induce the expression of pro-apoptotic factors. For example, ATF4 induces the expression of the <lb/>transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is associated with apoptotic cell-death. CHOP (also known as <lb/>GADD153) is a 29 kDa protein composed of an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal basic-leucine <lb/>zipper (bZIP) domain that is normally present at low levels in mammalian cells 40 . The transcriptional activator domain is <lb/>positively regulated by phosphorylation at S78 and S81 by p38 MAPK family members 90, 91 while the bZIP domain plays a key <lb/>role in the homodimerization of the protein 91, 92 . CHOP activity promotes apoptosis primarily by repression of Bcl2 expression <lb/>and the sensitization of cells to ER-stress inducing agents 29, 30 . <lb/>Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway <lb/>ATF6 activation involves a complex series of translocation and irreversible proteolytic processing steps, ultimately leading <lb/>to the up-regulation of a pro-survival transcriptional program, in the presence of unfolded or misfolded proteins. ATF6 is <lb/>a 90 kDa ER transmembrane protein with two homologs: ATF6α 48, 49 and ATF6β 93-95 . In the current model, only ATF6α <lb/>is included. Similar to IRE1 and PERK, ER stress leads to the dissociation of BIP from the N-terminus of ATF6, followed <lb/>by translocation and activation. N-terminal golgi localization sequences (GLS1 and GLS2) seem to be involved with BiP <lb/>regulation of ATF6. BiP binding to the N-terminal GLS1 promotes the retention of ATF6 in the ER 96 . On the other hand, the <lb/>GLS2 domain was required to target ATF6 to the golgi body following BiP dissociation from GLS1 96 . Unlike the previous two <lb/>kinase pathways, ATF6 activation does not involve phosphorylation of a C-terminal kinase domain. Rather, after translocated to <lb/>the golgi, ATF6 undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP); the luminal domain is first cleaved by serine protease <lb/>site-1 protease (S1P) followed by metalloprotease site-2 protease (S2P) cleavage 48, 97-99 . Cleavage at the juxtamembrane site <lb/>allows the 50 kDa transcriptional domain of ATF6 to be translocated to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of genes <lb/>with ATF/cAMP response elements (CREs) 100 and ER stress response elements (ERSE) in their promoters 52, 101 . Cleaved <lb/>ATF6 induces a gene expression program, in conjunction with other bZIP transcription factors and required co-regulators, such <lb/>as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) 52, 53 , that increases chaperone activity as well as the degradation of unfolded proteins 46, 102 . For <lb/>example, ATF6 upregulates BiP, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like <lb/>protein 1 (EDEM1) expression. Additionally, ATF6 induces the expression of the X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) which, after <lb/>processing by activated IRE1α, induces the expression of chaperones. The ATF6-induced gene expression program is also <lb/>cytoprotective. For example, ATF6 induces regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) expression 31 . RCAN1 sequesters calcineurin 31 , <lb/>a calcium activated protein-phosphotase B, that dephosphorylates Bcl2-antagonist of cell death (BAD) at S75 or S99 41 . This <lb/>leads to sequestering of Bcl2 by Bad, which inhibits its downstream anti-apoptotic activity 41 . <lb/>Inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) pathway <lb/>IRE1 initiates a program with both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic components in the presence of misfolded or unfolded <lb/>proteins. IRE1 is a 100 kDa type I ER transmembrane protein with both an endoribonuclease and a serine-threonine kinase <lb/>domain 3 . IRE1 has two homologs, IRE1α and IRE1β ; IRE1α is expressed in a variety of tissues 103 while IRE1β is found <lb/>only in the intestinal epithelia 103, 104 . In the current model only IRE1α has been considered. The N-terminus of IRE1, located <lb/>in the ER lumen, senses unfolded or misfolded proteins through its interaction with BiP 105-107 . Normally BiP is bound to <lb/>the N-terminus of IRE1 84, 108, 109 . However, in the presence of unfolding queues BiP dissociates and is sequestered by the <lb/>unfolded or misfolded proteins 110 . Subsequently, IRE1 is activated by homooligomerization followed by autophosphorylation <lb/>of the C-terminal kinase domain at S724 106, 111-113 . IRE1 activation enables both its kinase and endoribonuclease activities to <lb/>transduce signals simultaneously through two distinct signaling axes. The endoribonuclease activity cleaves a 26-nucleotide <lb/>intron from the XBP1-mRNA 47, 114, 115 which generates a 41 kDa frameshift variant (sXBP1) that acts as a potent transcription <lb/>factor. sXBP1 homodimers, along with co-regulators such as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), regulate the expression of a variety of ER <lb/>chaperones and protein degradation related genes 50, 51 . Cytosolic IRE1α dimers interact with adaptors such as tumor necrosis <lb/>factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to drive signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) activation and then subsequently cJUN <lb/>NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and p38MAPK activation 33 . ASK1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation at <lb/>several sites as well as by physical interaction with other proteins. ASK1 phosphorylates and activates two downstream kinases, <lb/>MMK4 and MMK3 which in turn activate JNK and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. JNK is activated by dual phosphorylation <lb/>at T183 and Y185 by MMK4 116 . Activated JNK activates the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim by phosphorylation <lb/>at S65 42, 43 . JNK activation also regulates the activity of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 44, 117 . Active JNK1 inhibits Bcl2 via <lb/>phosphorylation at sites T69, S70 and S87 117 . Ultimately, inhibition of Bcl2 and the activation of Bim leads to BAX/BAK <lb/>dependent apoptosis. Thus, signals initiated from the cytosolic kinase domain of IRE1α are largely pro-apoptotic. IRE1α <lb/>activity is regulated by protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PTC2P). <lb/></div>

            <div type="annex">ER stress-induced apoptosis <lb/>Ultimately, if UPR fails to restore ER homeostasis, cells initiate terminal programs such as apoptosis. A common biomarker of <lb/>apoptosis is the activation of aspartate-specific proteases, collectively known as caspases 118 . Caspases rapidly dismantle cell <lb/>cycle, cytoskeletal and organelle proteins by proteolytic cleavage. There are two pathways that result in caspase activation in <lb/>response to apoptotic signals; the death-receptor and the stress mediated pathways. The death-receptor pathway is marked <lb/>by ligand-mediated activation of death receptors on the plasma membrane. The alternative pathway for caspase activation <lb/>is mediated by cellular stress e.g., ER stress. Caspases are activated from their zymogens (procaspases), in response to <lb/>various death cues. First, the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9, are activated in response to death cues 119 . This <lb/>is followed by the activation of executioner caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7. Activated executioner <lb/>caspases proteolytically process several substrates, facilitating cell death. They also activate initiator caspases, forming a <lb/>positive feedback loop. Activation of both the PERK and IRE1 pathways modulate stress-induced apoptosis through their <lb/>regulation of Bcl2 expression and activity. Overall, stress induced apoptosis can occur through both mitochondrial-dependent <lb/>and independent pathways. Stress signals cause oligomerization of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak. These proteins <lb/>are normally sequestered at the mitochondrial outer membrane by the survival protein Bcl2, under non-apoptotic conditions 120 . <lb/>Once Bax and Bak oligomerize, they insert into the mitochondrial membrane and breach membrane integrity 121 . This results <lb/>in a net efflux of cytochrome-c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the initiation of the well-studied Apaf-1 mediated <lb/>caspase-9 activation pathway. Stress induced mitochondrial-independent apoptotic pathways are not well understood. Currently, <lb/>caspase 12 has been suggested as a possible ER-stress apoptotic mediator 34, 122, 123 . However, caspase 12 is not expressed in <lb/>human. Moreover, there is considerable debate about its role in stress-induced apoptotic cell-death 124 . <lb/>Model Building <lb/>Estimating a population of canonical models using POETs <lb/>Using the multiobjective POETs algorithm was used to generate predictive UPR model populations. Each model family was <lb/>trained and validated on different experimental data. Starting from an initial best-fit initial parameter set (nominal set), more <lb/>than 25,000 probable models were estimated by POETs from which we selected N = 100 models (25 from each training family) <lb/>with a Pareto rank of one or less (from approximately 1200 possible choices) for further study. The nominal, training (75 <lb/>models), and prediction (25 models) errors were calculated for each objective (Table T1). Models used for prediction error <lb/>calculations for a particular objective were not trained on that objective. The prediction likelihood was statistically significantly <lb/>better for 31 of the 33 objective functions at a 95% confidence level, compared with random parameter sets generated from the <lb/>nominal set (Table T1). <lb/>Strong Pareto fronts identified in POETs suggested an inability to simultaneously model different aspects of the training <lb/>data as well as experimental artifacts. Negative feedback was considered to lead to conflicting objectives. For example, XBP1 <lb/>mRNA measurements (O14) conflicted with CHOP protein measurements (O13), even though these data-sets were taken <lb/>from the same study and were collected in the same cell-line. XBP1 splicing increased BiP levels, which in turn reduced <lb/>CHOP protein levels, hence the trade-off. Lastly, in addition to fronts, we also observed strong correlation between objectives. <lb/>For example, models that performed well for the CHOP protein (O11), also performed well against Procaspase-12 (O22) <lb/>measurements, even though these were not in the same cell-line or from the same study. Both CHOP and Procaspase-12 are <lb/>downstream of the IRE1/TRAF2/JNK signaling cascade, so these errors were directly correlated (Fig. 2). <lb/>Signal flow, sensitivity, and robustness analysis of UPR network: <lb/>Simulated KO and OX studies of key protiens provided insight into the signal flow within the UPR network. Interestingly, <lb/>PERK and ATF4 KO studies revealed a slower and lower amount of BiP production (∼ 50%) as compared to WT. However, <lb/>ATF6 or IRE1 KO did not affect BiP regulation as compared to WT. This highlighted the dominant role of ATF4 in regulation of <lb/>BiP, which is consistent with experimental evidence 19 . Regulation of BiP was the critical regulator of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s), <lb/>which in turn acts as a key marker of progression through different stages of UPR (supplementary materials Fig. S2E). ATF4, <lb/>cleaved ATF6, and XBP1s act as integrators of the signals coming from all the three branches of UPR and furthermore leads to <lb/>regulation of BiP, thereby leading to a negative feedback or control of UPR signal. Another interesting note was the regulation <lb/>of pro-apoptosis phenotype via regulation of Bcl2. PERK and ATF4 KO led to delay in the onset of apoptosis (marked by <lb/>slower and lower reduction of Bcl2 levels, supplementary materials Fig. S2F). This effect could be attributed to the lack of <lb/>CHOP mediated branch of Bcl2 regulation. On the other hand, IRE1 and CHOP KO leads to drastic reduction in apoptosis <lb/>(marked by little or no change of Bcl2 levels, supplementary materials Fig. S2F). CHOP KO implicated the importance of <lb/>CHOP in the down-regulation of Bcl2. IRE1 KO implicated the critical role of IRE1-TRAF2 mediated route of apoptosis. <lb/>A few parameter sets for the sensitivity analysis were diversely selected based on the scatter in the CV values (supplementary <lb/>materials Fig. S1). Infrastructure parameters e.g. nuclear transport, RNA polymerase or ribosome binding were globally <lb/>critical, independent of stress (black points, Fig. 6). Additionally, apoptotic species and parameters were also important, <lb/></div>

			<page>S-3/S-13 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">both in the presence and absence of UPR (yellow points, Fig. 6). Thus, as expected, components such as RNA polymerase, <lb/>or caspase activation were globally important irrespective of the folding state of the ER. More interesting, however, were <lb/>coefficients that shifted above or below the 45 o -line in the presence of UPR. These points denote differentially important <lb/>network components. While the majority of parameters and species became more important in the presence of stress, we found <lb/>a band of parameters (Fig. 6 Inset) that were differentially important under stressed. For example, the rank-ordering of the <lb/>sensor and stress-transducer modules clearly increased in the presence of UPR; approximately 172 or 15% of the parameters <lb/>were significantly more important. These parameters were largely associated with adaptation and processing of unfolded <lb/>or misfolded proteins, e.g., unfolded protein degradation, cleaved ATF6-induced gene expression, IRE1-TRAF2 mediated <lb/>apoptosis regulation, and RCAN1 regulation. Likewise, 75 or 12% of the species were significantly more important in UPR <lb/>compared with normal protein loads (data not shown). <lb/>Interestingly, upon knockout of any individual feedback branch like that of ATF4, ATF6 and XBP1s, the system overall <lb/>remains equally robust. However the sensitivity of the alternate feedback components increases. Overall ∼ 54 % of the <lb/>parameters were differentially less sensitive upon removal of BiP feedback as compared to WT. This brings to light how the <lb/>presence of BiP feedback makes the system more susceptible/sensitive to perturbations. The specific relevance of ATF4 in <lb/>trageting BIP feedback was most evident upon KO of ATF4 feedback. We distinctly saw increase in sensitivity of feedback <lb/>components associated with XBP1s and ATF6 (supplementary materials Fig. S4). Upon ATF6 and XBP1s feedback KO, there <lb/>wasn&apos;t much change in terms of sensitivity of the system. This further attests the key regulatory effect of ATF4 in mediating <lb/>the positive BiP feedback which is an essential component of the adaptation phase of UPR. Another interesting observation <lb/>was that when we completely knockout all the feedback branches of BiP in the adaptation phase, the system overall becomes <lb/>relatively more robust (supplementary materials Fig. S4). We distinctly saw a major shift of sensitivity of BiP upon removal of <lb/>positive feedback. KO of ATF6 and XBP1s mediated feedback of BiP was seen to have little effect (as marked by robustness <lb/>coefficients for BiP, supplementary materials Fig. S7). However, ATF4 mediated feedback KO led to significant amount of <lb/>reduction in BiP levels (supplementary materials Fig. S7) thereby highlighting the significance of ATF4 in BiP feedback. Upon <lb/>KO of all branches of BiP feedback, we found overall reductions of BiP levels. However, there were two distinct populations. <lb/>One with a ∼ 10 fold reduction in BiP levels while the other had ∼ 1000 fold reduction in BiP levels. These two populations <lb/>could resemble two distinct operational paradigms within UPR. In the first mode of operation feedback, BiP regulation is really <lb/>strong resulting in drastic reductions in BiP levels and ultimately a stronger and faster UPR response upon knockout of BiP <lb/>feedback. <lb/>Structural and parametric uncertainty associated with current version of UPR model <lb/>First, the cytosolic kinase domain of PERK can be inhibited by the action of the DNAJ family member P58 IPK . P58 IPK was <lb/>initially discovered as an inhibitor of the eIF2α protein kinase PKR 59 . P58 IPK , whose expression is induced following ATF6 <lb/>activation, binds to the cytosolic kinase domain of PERK, inhibiting its activity 60, 61 . Inhibition of PERK kinase activity <lb/>relieves eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby removing the translational block. Interestingly, P58 IPK expression occurs several <lb/>hours after PERK activation and eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, P58 IPK induction may mark the end of UPR adaptation, and <lb/>the beginning of the alarm/apoptosis phase of the response 34 . Second, PERK induces a negative feedback loop, through its <lb/>downstream effector CHOP, involving the direct de-phosphorylation of eIF2α. CHOP induces the expression of GADD34 <lb/>which, in conjunction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), assembles into a phosphatase which dephosphorylates the S51 residue <lb/>of eIF2α 62 . GADD34 is a member of the GADD family of genes which are induced by DNA damage and a variety of other <lb/>cellular stresses 63 . The GADD34 binding partner in this complex appears to be responsible for PP1α recognition and targeting <lb/>of the phosphatase complex to the ER. Association between GADD34 and PP1 is encoded by a C-terminal canonical PP1 <lb/>binding motif, KVRF, while approximately 180 residues, near the N-terminus of GADD34, appear to be responsible for ER <lb/>localization 64 . Currently, little is known about deactivation of ATF6. Recently, XBP1u, the unspliced form of XBP1, has been <lb/>implicated as a negative regulator for ATF6 65 . Following, the induction of ER stress, two versions of XBP1 exist: XBP1u and <lb/>sXBP1 65 . In the recovery phase following ER stress, high levels of XBP1u may play a dual role. First, XBP1u binds sXBP1, <lb/>promoting complex degradation 66, 67 . Second, XBP1u can bind ATF6α rendering it more prone to proteasomal degradation 65 . <lb/>Taken together, these two steps may slow the transcription of ER chaperones and ERAD components during the recovery <lb/>phase following ER stress. IRE1α activity is regulated by several proteins, including tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), <lb/>ASK1-interactive protein 1 (AIP1) and members of the Bcl2 protein family. PTP-1B has been implicated in a number of IRE1α <lb/>signaling events. The absence of PTP-1B reduced IRE1α dependent JNK activation, XBP1 splicing and EDEM transcription in <lb/>immortalized and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts 125 . However, no physical interaction between IRE1α and PTP-1B <lb/>was established. On the other hand, AIP1 physically interacts with both TRAF2 and IRE1α, suggesting a model in which <lb/>AIP1 facilitates IRE1α dimerization and activation 126 . The C-terminal period-like domain (PER) of AIF1 binds the N-terminal <lb/>RING finger domain of TRAF2, followed by ASK1-JNK signaling 127 . Thus, based on these findings, Luo et al. postulated <lb/>that AIF1 may be directly involved in the IRE1α-TRAF2 complex and its activation of the ASK1-JNK signaling axis 126 . This <lb/></div>

			<page>S-4/S-13 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">hypothesis was validated in AIP1-KO mouse studies; AIP1-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and vascular endothelial <lb/>cells showed significant reductions in ER-stress induced ASK1-JNK activation that was rescued in AIP1 knock-in cells 126 . <lb/>IRE1α has also been shown to directly interact with Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak. Hetz et al. showed that Bax and Bak <lb/>complex with the cytosolic domain of IRE1α and modulate IRE1α signaling 128 . Bax and Bak double knockout mice failed <lb/>to signal through the IRE1α UPR branch following tunicamycin-induced ER stress; however, PERK signaling markers, e.g., <lb/>eIF2α phosphorylation, responded normally 128 . This pro-activation role of Bak and Bax may be modulated by one of the <lb/>few negative regulators of IRE1α activity, Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1). BI-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that enhances cell survival <lb/>following several intrinsic death stimuli 129 . Bailly-Maitre et al. were the first to suggest that BI-1 may downregulate IRE1α <lb/>and possibly ATF6 activity 130 . BI-1 deficient mice displayed increased XBP1s and enhanced JNK activity in the liver and <lb/>kidney, while eIF2α phosphorylation remained normal under ER-stress conditions 130 . Lisbona et al. later showed that BI-1 <lb/>directly interacts with the cytosolic domain of IRE1α, inhibiting its endoribonuclease activity 131 . Interestingly, BI-1 interacts <lb/>with several members of the Bcl2 protein family e.g., Bcl2 and Bcl-X L , even though it has no homology 129 . Members of the <lb/>HSP family of proteins have also been shown to regulate IRE1α. For example, HSP90 interacts with the cytosolic domain of <lb/>IRE1α, potentially protecting it from degradation by the proteasome 68 . HSP72 interaction with the cytosolic IRE1α domain <lb/>has also recently been shown to enhance IRE1α endoribonuclease activity 69 . Taken together, these modes of IRE1α regulation <lb/>with the exception of B1-1, largely promote or enhance IRE1α signaling. Given the importance of CHOP in regulation of Bcl2, <lb/>it is vital to establish the exact connectivity. However, while CHOP expression is negatively correlated with Bcl2 levels, there is <lb/>no CHOP binding site in the bcl2 promoter 30 . McCullough et al. have suggested that the bZIP domain of CHOP could act with <lb/>other bZIP transcription factors to regulate bcl2 expression 30 . Thus, it&apos;s likely that the connection between CHOP expression <lb/>and apoptosis is more complex than simple down-regulation of Bcl2 expression. These missing structural connections shall <lb/>allow us to establish a detailed model and extract more relevant insights into manipulating UPR. <lb/></div>
