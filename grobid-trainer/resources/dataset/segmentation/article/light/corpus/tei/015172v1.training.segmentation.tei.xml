			<front>Selection constrains phenotypic evolution in a <lb/>functionally important plant trait <lb/>Christopher D. Muir 1 <lb/>1 Biodiversity Research Centre and Botany Department, University of British Columbia, <lb/>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada <lb/>6270 University Blvd. <lb/>Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z4 <lb/>E-mail: cdmuir@biodiversity.ubc.ca <lb/>Phone: (778) 228-4851 <lb/>Keywords: Adaptive landscape | phenotypic constraint | stomata | amphistomy | <lb/>phylogenetic comparative methods <lb/> 1 <lb/> Abstract <lb/>A long-standing idea is that the macroevolutionary adaptive landscape -a &apos;map&apos; <lb/>of phenotype to fitness -constrains evolution because certain phenotypes are fit, <lb/>while others are universally unfit. Such constraints should be evident in traits that, <lb/>across many species, cluster around particular modal values, with few intermediates <lb/>between modes. Here, I compile a new global database of 599 species from 94 plant <lb/>families showing that stomatal ratio, an important functional trait affecting photo-<lb/>synthesis, is multimodal, hinting at distinct peaks in the adaptive landscape. The <lb/>dataset confirms that most plants have all their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hy-<lb/>postomy), but shows for the first time that species with roughly half their stomata on <lb/>each leaf surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. Based <lb/>on a new evolutionary process model, this multimodal pattern is unlikely without <lb/>constraint. Further, multimodality has evolved repeatedly across disparate fami-<lb/>lies, evincing long-term constraint on the adaptive landscape. A simple cost-benefit <lb/>model of stomatal ratio demonstrates that selection alone is sufficient to generate an <lb/>adaptive landscape with multiple peaks. Finally, phylogenetic comparative methods <lb/>indicate that life history evolution drives shifts between peaks. This implies that <lb/>the adaptive benefit conferred by amphistomy -increased photosynthesis -is most <lb/>important in plants with fast life histories, challenging existing ideas that amphis-<lb/>tomy is an adaptation to thick leaves and open habitats. I conclude that peaks in <lb/>the adaptive landscape have been constrained by selection over much of land plant <lb/>evolution, leading to predictable, repeatable patterns of evolution. <lb/></front>

			<body>The topography of the macroevolutionary adaptive landscape is thought to shape <lb/>the broad patterns of life&apos;s diversity [1]. Adaptive landscapes with multiple peaks <lb/>are manifest in convergent evolution of similar phenotypes across independent evo-<lb/>lutionary lineages. In such cases, surveys across species should reveal a multimodal <lb/>trait distribution in which the modes point to the underlying peaks in the landscape. <lb/>Multimodality has been observed frequently among plants and animals, including <lb/>traits such as self-incompatibility [2], the precocial-altricial spectrum [3], pollination <lb/>syndromes [4], ecomorphology in Anolis [5], and plant height [6]. That such disparate <lb/>classes of traits show broadly similar patterns suggests that divergence on a multi-<lb/>peaked adaptive landscape may be a general feature of macroevolution. However, we <lb/>rarely know whether multimodality reflects constraints imposed by the underlying <lb/>adaptive landscape and not some other constraint on phenotypic evolution. <lb/>In particular, certain phenotypes may be common not because they are more fit, <lb/>but rather because they are genetically, developmentally, or functionally accessible. <lb/>Conversely, rare phenotypes might be inaccessible. I use the definitions given by <lb/>Arnold [7]: genetic constraints are limitations set by the &quot;pattern of genetic variation <lb/>and covariation for a set of traits&quot;; developmental constraints are limitations on &quot;pos-<lb/>sible developmental states&quot;; and functional constraints are imposed by &quot;time, energy, <lb/>or the laws of physics&quot;. Arnold contrasts these with selective constraints determined <lb/>by the adaptive landscape. There are examples of genetic [8], developmental [9], <lb/>and functional [10] constraints on phenotypic evolution acting in nature, meaning <lb/>that we cannot assume selection alone shapes trait evolution. Compelling evidence <lb/>from cross species comparisons that selection constrains phenotypic evolution re-<lb/>quires showing that phenotypic evolution is constrained, that selection is sufficient <lb/>to explain the inferred constraint, and that nonselective constraints are inconsistent <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>with these observations. <lb/>Here, I evaluate evidence for selective constraints on a functionally important plant <lb/>trait, stomatal ratio, using comparative methods and theory. Stomatal ratio, defined <lb/>as the ratio of upper to lower stomatal density, impacts how plants &apos;eat&apos; (i.e. as-<lb/>similate CO 2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis). Physiological experiments <lb/>and biophysical theory demonstrate that amphistomatous leaves, those that have <lb/>equal stomatal densities on both upper and lower surfaces, maximize photosynthetic <lb/>rate by minimizing the distance between substomatal cavities and chloroplasts, fa-<lb/>cilitating rapid CO 2 diffusion [11, 12, 13, 14]. Hence, nearly all plants should be <lb/>amphistomatous to maximize photosynthesis, yet paradoxically up to 90% of plant <lb/>species in some communities are hypostomatous [15, 16, 17, 18], meaning that most <lb/>stomata are on the lower surface. In rare cases, most stomata are on the upper sur-<lb/>face (hyperstomy). I use upper and lower rather than abaxial and adaxial, because <lb/>the former applies to &apos;upside-down&apos; (i.e. resupinate) leaves. Stomatal ratio is a quan-<lb/>titative metric that describes continuous variation between hypo-and hyperstomy. <lb/>Multiple lines of evidence indicate selection on stomatal ratio, but there is little <lb/>consensus on the adaptive significance. Stomatal ratio varies widely, but nonran-<lb/>domly [15, 17, 11, 19, 20, 21] and evolves rapidly in some taxa, possibly due to <lb/>selection [22, 23, 24]. Several environmental and anatomical factors have been hy-<lb/>pothesized to favour amphistomy (Table 1). The mechanistic details and literature <lb/>underlying these hypotheses and predictions are described in Text S1. The prepon-<lb/>derance of hypostomy almost certainly reflects a cost of upper stomata. For example, <lb/>hypostomy has evolved anew in resupinate leaves [25]. Upper stomata might be costly <lb/>because they increase susceptibility to foliar pathogens (e.g. rust fungi) that infect <lb/>through stomata [13], suggesting that stomatal ratio mediates a tradeoff between <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>photosynthetic rate and defence [23], but other costs have been proposed (Text S1). <lb/>Identifying the selective forces (i.e. fitness benefits and costs) shaping stomatal ratio <lb/>have been hampered by four methodological limitations. Namely, previous studies <lb/>were typically qualitative rather than quantitative, confined to specific geographic re-<lb/>gions or clades, did not account for phylogenetic nonindependence, and did not take <lb/>into account multiple confounding factors. To overcome these limitations, I assem-<lb/>bled a quantitative, global, and phylogenetically extensive database that disentangles <lb/>correlated predictor variables (e.g. light level and leaf thickness). <lb/>This new dataset revealed that stomatal ratio is a multimodal trait (Fig. 1). To <lb/>test whether the observed pattern is consistent with constraint, I modified previous <lb/>evolutionary process models to accommodate bounded traits like stomatal ratio. Fit-<lb/>ting this model to the data indicates that stomatal ratio is highly constrained by a <lb/>rugged adaptive landscape with multiple selective regimes (for discussion of selective <lb/>regimes, see [26, 27, 5]). This led me to evaluate whether selection is sufficient to <lb/>account for inferred constraints using theoretical and empirical approaches. First, I <lb/>constructed a simple cost-benefit model consistent with the underlying physics and <lb/>a minimum of additional assumptions. This model indicates that distinct peaks in <lb/>the adaptive landscape can result from selective constraints, even when the under-<lb/>lying environmental gradients are smooth. In contrast, a review of the literature <lb/>does not support a large role for genetic, developmental, and functional constraints. <lb/>Finally, phylogenetic multiple regression identifies life history evolution as the pri-<lb/>mary selective agent underlying peak shifts, but anatomical and climatic factors are <lb/>also important. By merging theory and data, this study adduces compelling new <lb/>evidence that selection is the primary constraint on phenotypic evolution, at least <lb/>for stomatal ratio. There is no reason to believe this trait is exceptional among func-<lb/></body>

			<body>tional traits, and hence the inferences drawn here could be generalizable to many <lb/>other phenotypes that exhibit similar patterns indicative of evolutionary constraint. <lb/>Results <lb/>Stomatal ratio evolution is constrained by multiple selective <lb/>regimes <lb/>I compiled a new, global dataset from 25 previously published studies (Text S2) <lb/>containing trait data (stomatal ratio and leaf thickness) on 599 species across 94 <lb/>plant families; the dataset with trait and climate data comprised a 552 species subset <lb/>covering 90 families. The most striking feature of the data is that stomatal ratio (SR) <lb/>is highly multimodal (Fig. 1), with apparent modes at 0 (hypostomatous), ≈ 0.5 <lb/>(amphistomatous), and 1 (hyperstomatous). Note that here I am reporting stomatal <lb/>ratio as the ratio of upper density to total density so that the distinct hypo-and <lb/>hyperstomatous modes can be seen. Stomatal ratio does not conform to a nonmodal, <lb/>uniform distribution (Komologrov-Smirnov test, D = 0.433, P = 1.11 × 10 −15 ), <lb/>even after removing all hypostomatous (SR = 0) species (K-S test, D = 0.293, <lb/>P = 1.33 × 10 −15 ). The data are also inconsistent with a unimodal, truncated <lb/>exponential distribution bounded by 0 and 1 (K-S test, D = 0.429, P = 1.11×10 −15 ). <lb/>In contrast, the distribution of stomatal ratio values across species is consistent <lb/>with an evolutionary process model that includes constraints imposed by multiple <lb/>selective regimes, indicating a rugged adaptive landscape. Although the results pre-<lb/>sented in this section only identify constraint, not necessarily selective constraint, <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>I use selective regime because evidence in the following sections indicates that se-<lb/>lection is the primary constraint. To infer regimes, I augmented a commonly used <lb/>model of selective regimes, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [28], to account for traits <lb/>like SR that are bounded by 0 and 1 (see Materials and Methods and Text S3 for <lb/>further detail and mathematical derivation). Under a bounded Ornstein-Uhlenbeck <lb/>process model, the stationary distribution of stomatal ratio (or any proportion trait) <lb/>r follows a Beta distribution: <lb/>f (r) = <lb/>r 2φθ−1 (1 − r) 2φ(1−θ)−1 <lb/>B(2φθ, 2φ(1 − θ)) <lb/>(1) <lb/>B(•) refers to the Beta function. A selective regime at stationarity is characterized <lb/>by two parameters, a long-run average or &apos;optimum&apos; in the adaptive landscape, θ, <lb/>and a precision, φ, around the optimum. Greater values of φ produce distributions <lb/>that are more tightly constrained around the optimum. <lb/>If a trait evolves on an adaptive landscape with multiple peaks, then a model <lb/>with multiple selective regimes should fit the data better than a model with a single <lb/>regime [27, 5]. I used finite mixture model analysis (Text S4) to estimate the number <lb/>of selective regimes. This approach differs from conceptually similar methods, but <lb/>can be applied to non-Gaussian traits like SR (see [29, 30] for alternative methods <lb/>with Gaussian traits). I inferred three selective regimes (Table 2), but note that the <lb/>mapping between modes and regimes is not always one-to-one. In particular, one <lb/>regime produces modes at both 0 and 1 (Fig. S1). Nevertheless, the data clearly <lb/>support the large number of hypostomatous (SR = 0) species as a distinct mode <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>(Fig. S1). There was also strong support for an amphistomatous regime (compare <lb/>Fig. S1A to Fig. S1B). Finally, the best-supported model also included a small mode <lb/>for hyperstomatous species and a separate, smaller regime for species intermediate <lb/>between hypo-and amphistomy (Fig. S1C). <lb/>The same general pattern seen at the global scale -multiple selective regimes lead-<lb/>ing to distinct modes -is recapitulated within nine of ten families best-represented in <lb/>the global dataset (Fig. 2). Two regimes are supported in most (8 of 9) multi-regime <lb/>families, except Asteraceae, in which three regimes are favoured (Fig. 2A). In one <lb/>family, Rubiaceae, all species were inferred as members of a hypostomatous regime. <lb/>In all mutli-regime families except Poaceae, there are distinct regimes associated with <lb/>hypo-and amphistomy; in Poaceae, there are hyper-and amphistomous regimes in-<lb/>stead (Fig. 2E). However, the hyperstomatous species of Poaceae in this study may <lb/>not be representative of family since they are wetland specialists in the genus Spartina <lb/>[31]. Generally, the internal (i.e. amphistomatous) mode is closely centered around <lb/>0.5, as predicted from biophysical theory [11, 13], except in in the Rosaceae, where <lb/>the inferred optimum is closer to 0.25. Although I was unable to account for phyloge-<lb/>netic nonindependence in these analyses (see Materials and Methods), that a similar <lb/>pattern -species are either amphistomatous or hypo/hyperstomatous, but rarely in-<lb/>termediate -emerges independently in multiple families indicates the conclusions are <lb/>unlikely to change qualitatively once fully phylogenetic methods can be extended to <lb/>bounded traits. In summary, the apparent pattern of constraint on stomatal ratio is <lb/>strikingly similar across multiple disparate families and at a global scale, suggesting <lb/>convergent evolution because of shared phenotypic constraint. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Selection is sufficient to accommodate constraint <lb/>I analyzed a simple cost-benefit model of stomatal ratio to ask whether selection is <lb/>sufficient to account for apparent phenotypic constraint. Not surprisingly, selection <lb/>favours greater stomatal ratio (S fit ) as the fitness benefit of greater photosynthesis <lb/>increases relative to the cost of upper stomata (Fig. 3A-C), but the shape of the <lb/>function is highly sensitive to one parameter in the model, σ 2 . In particular, the <lb/>adaptive landscape goes from being smooth when σ 2 is high to rugged when σ 2 is <lb/>low (Fig. 3D-F). When the landscape is smooth, intermediate phenotypes between <lb/>complete hypostomy and amphistomy are best when the benefit:cost ratio itself is <lb/>intermediate. In contrast, when the landscape is rugged, intermediates are univer-<lb/>sally less fit than either of the boundary phenotypes. In a rugged landscape, as the <lb/>benefit:cost ratio decreases there is a sudden shift from amphistomy being favoured <lb/>to hypostomy being favoured. The dearth of species with intermediate SR in nature, <lb/>especially within families, therefore suggests that the adaptive landscape for stomatal <lb/>ratio is generally rugged. Numerical simulations based on smooth variation in the <lb/>benefit:cost ratio indicate that the simple, yet realistic assumptions of this model are <lb/>sufficient to generate qualitatively similar patterns of multimodality to those seen in <lb/>nature (Fig. 3G-H). <lb/>Growth form, leaf thickness, and precipitation shape stomatal <lb/>ratio evolution <lb/>If stomatal ratio is strongly associated with other traits or climatic factors, especially <lb/>if there are compelling a priori hypotheses (Table 1) supporting such associations, <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>then it suggests that trait variation is shaped by selection. Phylogenetic multiple <lb/>regression consistently identified growth form and, to a lesser extent, leaf thickness <lb/>and precipitation as the best predictors of stomatal ratio (Table 3). Amphistomy <lb/>was strongly associated with fast growth forms (herbaceous plants), whereas hypos-<lb/>tomy was most common in slower growing shrubs and trees (Fig. 4). As predicted <lb/>by biophysical theory [11, 13], thicker leaves also tended to be amphistomatous, al-<lb/>though the correlation was weak (Fig. S2A). Finally, amphistomy was more common <lb/>in dry environments, whereas hypo/hyperstomy were associated with higher precip-<lb/>itation (Fig. S2B). Elevation and leaf area index, a proxy for open habitat, were <lb/>not significantly associated with stomatal ratio in this dataset (Table 3). In single <lb/>regressions, amphistomy was more common more open environments, as in previous <lb/>studies [12, 18, 19, 21], but this correlation was not significant after precipitation <lb/>was factored into multiple regression (precipitation and leaf area index are positively <lb/>correlated). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Phenotypic evolution is often constrained, but the relative role of selective versus <lb/>nonselective constraints is unclear. This study posits that multimodal traits reveal <lb/>distinct peaks of high fitness in a rugged adaptive landscape. Hence, the prevalence <lb/>of certain phenotypes and the dearth of others directly reflects selective constraints <lb/>on phenotypic evolution. Evidence from a new, global dataset clearly shows that <lb/>stomatal ratio is a multimodal trait (Fig. 1) and that multimodality has evolved <lb/>repeatedly in land plants (Fig. 2). These patterns are difficult to reconcile with <lb/>models omitting constraint, but are consistent with a rugged adaptive landscape <lb/></body>

			<body>comprised of multiple selective regimes (Table 2). A simple cost-benefit model of <lb/>stomatal ratio shows that selection is a sufficient explanation, particularly when the <lb/>underlying adaptive landscape is predominantly rugged. Adaptive evolution from <lb/>one peak in the landscape to another (i.e. hypo-to amphistomy or vice versa) <lb/>appears to be primarily driven by growth form, suggesting that the fitness benefit <lb/>of amphistomy -faster diffusion of CO 2 to chloroplasts -is greatest in species with <lb/>&apos;fast&apos; life histories. <lb/>Multimodality implies constraint on the macroevolutionary adap-<lb/>tive landscape <lb/>Just as water is only found as ice, liquid, and steam, despite continuous variation <lb/>in temperature, stomatal ratio comes in partially discrete clusters corresponding <lb/>to hypo-, amphi-, and hyperstomy, but less often intermediate (Fig. 1). In fact, <lb/>the modes identified here correspond remarkably with traditional botanical classi-<lb/>fications [32], suggesting that these workers recognized the pattern even without <lb/>quantitative analyses. The multimodal pattern in the dataset cannot be explained <lb/>by an evolutionary process model neglecting constraint (Text S3). However, appar-<lb/>ent clustering could occur by systematic underrepresentation of intermediate trait <lb/>values [33] or nonrandom taxon sampling. It is highly improbable that intermediate <lb/>phenotypes exist at greater frequency in nature but are rarely reported, as most <lb/>studies have no a priori hypothesis about stomatal ratio in their study organisms. <lb/>If anything, by omitting many studies that report only qualitative data, I might <lb/>have enriched the frequency of intermediate phenotypes, as these are the most likely <lb/>to be reported quantitatively. Nonrandom taxon sampling, without accounting for <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>phylogeny, could also give the appearance of multimodality. To give an extreme ex-<lb/>ample, if there had been a single transition from hypo-to amphistomy followed by <lb/>stasis, then sampling the tips of the phylogeny would produce a multimodal pattern <lb/>with apparently strong statistical support, even though it only represents a single <lb/>evolutionary event. Methodological limitations prevented me from fully accounting <lb/>for phylogeny (see Materials and Methods), but the fact that multimodality reap-<lb/>pears in multiple distantly-related families (Fig. 2) makes nonrandom taxon sampling <lb/>alone an unlikely explanation, though it might accentuate the pattern. Future work <lb/>is needed to extend regime-inference methods [27, 29, 30] to non-Gaussian traits, as <lb/>this study begins to do with a new evolutionary process model for proportion traits. <lb/>Selection is the most likely explanation for phenotypic con-<lb/>straint <lb/>In principle, constraint could reflect a mix of selective, genetic, developmental, and <lb/>functional factors [7]. However, the preponderance of available theory and data on <lb/>stomatal ratio suggests selection is responsible for most if not all of the phenotypic <lb/>constraint. Genetic, developmental, and functional constraints cannot explain the <lb/>dearth of intermediate phenotypes because intermediates are genetically accessible <lb/>as well as developmentally and functionally possible. The appropriate mutations <lb/>to generate intermediate phenotypes occur spontaneously during mutagenesis [34], <lb/>segregate among natural populations [35, 36, 37, 23], and are fixed between closely <lb/>related species [38, 24]. <lb/>In contrast, the cost-benefit model presented here shows that with a small number <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>of realistic, evidence-based assumptions, selection is sufficient to accommodate the <lb/>data and helps clarify why discrete modes form even when the underlying environ-<lb/>mental gradients are smooth (environmental gradients need not be smooth, but it <lb/>is unnecessary to assume otherwise). Stomata are often distributed equally on both <lb/>surfaces (amphistomy) because this arrangement optimizes photosynthetic rate. This <lb/>was an assumption of the model based on biophysical theory [11, 13]. More often, <lb/>all stomata are on the lower surface because the costs of upper stomata outweigh <lb/>the benefits. A dearth of intermediates between hypo-and amphistomy occurs when <lb/>the landscape is rugged, making these phenotypes often fall in a fitness valley. How-<lb/>ever, the best mixture model includes a small peak of these intermediates (Table 2, <lb/>Fig. S1). This suggests that although the adaptive landscape is constrained and often <lb/>rugged, it may shift from rugged to smooth over macroevolutionary time. However, <lb/>the fact that most species, especially within families (Fig. 2), cluster around partic-<lb/>ular modes suggests that the landscape is predominantly rugged. Finally, the small <lb/>number of hyperstomatous species indicates that there are occasionally situations in <lb/>which upper stomata are favoured, such as in aquatic plants or those with unusual <lb/>epidermal or spongy mesophyll anatomy. <lb/>Life history, more than anatomy and climate, determines stom-<lb/>atal ratio <lb/>Nonrandom association between stomatal ratio, other ecologically important traits, <lb/>and climate also supports a significant role for selection in shaping trait evolution. <lb/>To my knowledge, this is the first study to rigorously demonstrate a strong associ-<lb/>ation between growth form and stomatal ratio, although it had been suggested by <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>earlier ecological surveys [15, 39]. Two hypotheses that might explain the relation-<lb/>ship between growth form and stomatal ratio are: 1) herbaceous plants have shorter <lb/>leaf lifespans [40], requiring higher photosynthetic rates to pay their construction <lb/>costs in a shorter time [41]; 2) herbaceous plants have faster life histories, leading to <lb/>stronger selection on high growth rates, mediated in part by higher leaf-level pho-<lb/>tosynthetic rate [42]. That the relationship between stomatal ratio and whole-plant <lb/>lifespan holds within herbaceous (annuals vs. perennials) and woody (shrubs vs. <lb/>trees), supports the second hypothesis (selection on faster life history favours am-<lb/>phistomy). Although this hypothesis requires further testing, if correct, it implies <lb/>remarkably strong selection on leaf-level photosynthesis, as the photosynthetic ad-<lb/>vantage of amphistomy over hypostomy is only a few percent in a typical herbaceous <lb/>leaf [11]. <lb/>Surprisingly, I found little evidence supporting the most common adaptive expla-<lb/>nation for amphistomy, that thicker leaves &apos;need&apos; stomata on both sides to facilitate <lb/>CO 2 diffusion [11]. In actuality, support for this hypothesis is mixed (Text S1), espe-<lb/>cially when phylogenetic nonindependence is taken into account [43, 39] (but see [44]). <lb/>It is now clear why previous studies came to different conclusions: thicker leaves do <lb/>tend to be amphistomatous, even once phylogeny is accounted for, but the trend is <lb/>weak (Fig. S2A). Less powerful studies than this one could easily have failed to de-<lb/>tect a significant relationship. Hence, leaf thickness, by constraining CO 2 diffusion, <lb/>imposes selection for amphistomy. I also found that amphistomy was more common <lb/>in plants from low precipitation environments. For a given stomatal conductance, <lb/>which is proportional to evaporative water loss, amphistomy improves water-use ef-<lb/>ficiency by increasing photosynthetic rate [11], suggesting a plausible mechanism for <lb/>selection on amphistomy in dry environments. Although low precipitation was cor-<lb/></body>

			<body>related with habitat openness, measured using leaf area index, multiple phylogenetic <lb/>regression indicated that precipitation was causal, in contrast to previous studies <lb/>[18, 21]. These studies used finer scale (plant-level) descriptions of light environment <lb/>that might have been missed by the coarser, satellite-based measurements of canopy <lb/>cover used here. Alternatively, patterns at the global scale might differ from those <lb/>within particular families or biomes. Finally, I was unable to test the effects of leaf <lb/>orientation and stomatal packing on stomatal ratio, though these are likely to be <lb/>important factors in many plants [20]. The evidence from this and previous studies <lb/>shows that stomatal ratio is an ecologically relevant functional trait that could be <lb/>valuable in physiological ecological and evolution [45]. <lb/>That many ecologically important traits, like stomatal ratio, cluster around par-<lb/>ticular values but not others suggests pervasive constraint on phenotypic evolution. <lb/>How can we seek a general explanation for this pattern when any particular instance <lb/>requires specific mechanistic and ecological knowledge about a focal trait? For ex-<lb/>ample, the emerging evidence from this and other recent studies on stomatal ratio <lb/>(see especially [23]) is that peaks of high fitness are constrained by a tradeoff be-<lb/>tween photosynthetic rate and defence against foliar pathogens that preferentially <lb/>infect though upper stomata. In particular, the cost-benefit model analyzed here <lb/>predicts that even a small change in the fitness costs or benefits are sufficient to <lb/>shift fitness peaks into qualitatively different selective regimes. If it is generally true <lb/>that multimodal traits are associated with rapid regime shifts, then one way forward <lb/>is to look for signatures of such shifts in closely-related species that sit astride dif-<lb/>ferent regimes. For example, one signature of regime shifts could be the presence <lb/>of quantitative trait loci large enough to pass over valleys separating fitness peaks. <lb/>Consistent with this, [24] recently identified two large effect loci that together are <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>capable of making a hypostomatous leaf amphistomatous, perhaps suggesting that <lb/>these loci enabled a regime shift. Integrating comparative biology, mechanistic stud-<lb/>ies of organismal function, and the genetics of adaptation, as this and others studies <lb/>[46] have begun to do, points to a general approach for evaluating the common fea-<lb/>tures of macroevolutionary adaptive landscapes and, hence, the role of selection in <lb/>constraining phenotypic evolution. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Assembling a comparative data set <lb/>Stomatal ratio and leaf thickness I collected quantitative data on stomatal <lb/>ratio and leaf thickness from previously published studies (see Text S2 for full list of <lb/>sources). These data are spread across a large and diverse literature, including func-<lb/>tional ecology, taxonomy, agriculture, and physiology. Hence, neither a standardized <lb/>nor exhaustive search was possible. I started by using Web of Knowledge to locate <lb/>studies that cited seminal papers on the adaptive significance of amphistomy, specif-<lb/>ically [11] and [12]. Once I found a paper with data, I examined papers that cited <lb/>those ones. Finally, I found additional data sources in comprehensive reviews of <lb/>plant anatomy [47, 32, 48]. For all data papers, I recorded the mean leaf thickness, <lb/>abaxial (lower) and adaxial (upper) stomatal density for each species. Where only <lb/>ranges were given, I used the midpoint. If the study included a treatment, I col-<lb/>lected only data from the control treatment. If studies measured both juvenile and <lb/>adult leaves, I used only adult leaves (no study reported only juvenile leaves). Usu-<lb/>ally data were given in a table, but occasionally I used ImageJ [49] to extract data <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>from figures or contacted authors for data. I only included data from studies that <lb/>intentionally examined both surfaces for stomata; I excluded data from studies that <lb/>described species categorically as &quot;hypostomatous&quot;, or &quot;amphistomatous&quot;, or &quot;hyper-<lb/>stomatous&quot;. Excluding qualitative data was necessary because there is no standard <lb/>definition of &quot;amphistomy&quot; -it has sometimes been used to describe species that <lb/>have approximately equal densities on each side [11] and at other times for species <lb/>that have any stomata on the both surfaces [16, 15]. <lb/>Climate and elevation Based on the a priori hypotheses, I extracted data on <lb/>mean annual precipitation (average 1950 -2000), elevation (Worldclim [50]), and <lb/>light environment (average leaf area index between 1982 -1998 based on remote <lb/>sensing [51]). For light environment, I used a satellite indicator of leaf area index, the <lb/>number of leaf layers between the ground and top of the canopy. Lower leaf area index <lb/>is interpreted as a more open light environment. The strength of these global data <lb/>sources is that I was able to obtain data for every species from the same dataset. A <lb/>limitation of these data is that even the highest resolution (≈ 1 km) data might miss <lb/>important temporal and microsite variation. I discuss these limitations in light of the <lb/>findings in the Discussion. For climate and elevation, geographic coordinates for each <lb/>species are needed. For this, I downloaded all georeferenced herbarium specimens <lb/>for a given species from GBIF (last accessed Jan 15-18, 2015) using the occ_search <lb/>function in rgbif [52]. I filtered out or manually edited clearly erroneous locations (e.g. <lb/>lat = 0 or lon = 0 or where lat and lon were clearly reversed). The mean and median <lb/>number of GBIF georeferenced occurrences per species was 737 and 194, respectively. <lb/>I calculated the trimmed-mean (10% trim) mean annual precipitation, elevation, and <lb/>leaf area index to further remove specimens well outside the species&apos; range, possibly <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>because they were, say, misidentified, cultivated, or improperly georeferenced. <lb/>Growth Form I partitioned species by growth form into the following categories: <lb/>trees, small trees/shrubs, shrubs, and herbaceous species (forbs and grasses). Herba-<lb/>ceous species were further subdivided into annuals, biennials, and perennials. Species <lb/>that were variable or intermediate (e.g. annual/biennial, annual/perennial, bien-<lb/>nial/perennial, or annual/biennial/perennial) were classified as &apos;biennial&apos;. Subshrubs <lb/>with some woody growth were lumped with perennials rather than shrubs. Where <lb/>possible, I obtained growth form data from associated data papers. When this infor-<lb/>mation was not given, I used regional floras, supplemented by online trait databases <lb/>such as USDA Plants [53] and Encyclopedia of Life [54]. When these sources were <lb/>unavailable or ambiguous for a given species, I checked the primary taxonomic liter-<lb/>ature by searching the species name in Google Scholar. <lb/>Taxonomic name resolution I submitted taxonomic names in the database to <lb/>the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS) [55]. I used names given by TNRS <lb/>when it returned an accepted name or synonym with overall score greater than <lb/>0.97 (scores are between 0 to 1). I scrutinized names where TNRS deemed the <lb/>name illegitimate, gave no opinion, or was otherwise ambiguous. At that point, I <lb/>consulted additional plant taxonomic repositories: The Plant List [56], International <lb/>Plant Names Index [57], and the Euro+Med PlantBase [58]. When no accepted <lb/>names were identified, I used original name given by the authors. For two very <lb/>recent papers [59, 60], I used the names given by those authors. <lb/></body>

			<body>Pattern to process: connecting multimodality to phenotypic <lb/>constraint <lb/>Comparative methods often infer constraint by comparing the fit of evolutionary <lb/>process models with and without constraint. Constraint, usually interpreted as a se-<lb/>lective regime, is typically modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [28, 27, 5], but <lb/>this model is inappropriate for proportion traits like stomatal ratio. I therefore devel-<lb/>oped a new evolutionary process model that is analogous to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck <lb/>process except that traits are bounded by 0 and 1. A full description of model <lb/>assumptions and a derivation of the stationary distribution under a given selective <lb/>regime are available in Text S3. The key result is that a trait evolving under a single <lb/>selective regime should conform to a Beta distribution at stationarity. <lb/>Multimodality suggests the presence of multiple selective regimes associated with <lb/>different modes. I tested for multiple regimes using a conceptually similar but some-<lb/>what different approach than previous studies. Current methods for inferring mul-<lb/>tiple selective regimes are in their infancy [27, 29, 30] and cannot yet accommodate <lb/>Beta-distributed traits because I could not obtain a general solution to the stochastic <lb/>differential equation in Text S3. Future work is needed to develop numerical meth-<lb/>ods, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation [61], to integrate the bounded <lb/>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process model elaborated here into existing statistical frame-<lb/>works for multi-regime inference. However, a few lines of reasoning I discuss below <lb/>indicate that the main conclusions of this study are robust. <lb/>I used finite mixture models to infer the number of selective regimes shaping <lb/>stomatal ratio evolution (see [6] for a similar approach). That is, I assume the current <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>distribution of trait values across species can be represented as a mixture of multiple <lb/>selective regimes at stationarity, each of which is modelled as a Beta-distributed <lb/>variable. To fit models, I used an expectation-maximization algorithm to find the <lb/>maximum likelihood mixture model from the data. A complete derivation of the <lb/>likelihood function and a description of the fitting algorithm are given in Text S4. R <lb/>code to implement the algorithm is available on Dryad [62]. I selected the best model <lb/>using the more conservative Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compensate for <lb/>the fact that I am not accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence in this analysis <lb/>(see below). I accepted models with an additional selective regime if they decreased <lb/>BIC by 2 or more. By fitting the data to the stationary distribution, I implicitly <lb/>assume that evolution is sufficiently rapid to ignore phylogenetic signal. Numerical <lb/>simulations of the diffusion indicate that the transitory distribution is also Beta (data <lb/>not shown), meaning that evidence for multiple regimes (i.e. a better fit of a mixture <lb/>model with multiple Beta components) cannot be an artifact of transitory behaviour <lb/>within a single regime. I also tested for multiple regimes within families where there <lb/>was sufficient data (n ≥ 15). Ten families met this criterion. For each family, I <lb/>compared the fit of mixtures with k = 1, 2, or 3 regimes, accepting models with an <lb/>additional regime if they decreased BIC by 2 or more. Further, I rejected additional <lb/>regimes supported by BIC if one of those regimes contained fewer than 3 species <lb/>(this affected Poaceae and Salicaceae). Although testing for multiple regimes within <lb/>families using the stationary distribution is an imperfect substitute for fitting the <lb/>process model to the entire tree, it is nevertheless informative. If multiple regimes <lb/>are found repeatedly in disparate families, this provides compelling evidence for <lb/>convergent evolution because of phenotypic constraints imposed by similar adaptive <lb/>landscapes. <lb/></body>

			<body>Is selection sufficient to account for multimodality? <lb/>In this section, I use theory to ask under what conditions selection can explain the <lb/>rugged adaptive landscape implied by fitting the evolutionary process model to the <lb/>data. First, I ask whether a model with simple fitness costs and benefits of upper <lb/>stomata produces multiple fitness peaks (Text S1 discusses the fitness benefits and <lb/>costs associated with stomatal ratio). Next, I examine whether such a landscape <lb/>generates a trait distribution that qualitatively resembles the data, even when the <lb/>underlying environmental gradients are smooth. I specifically focus on the pattern <lb/>observed within families, where there was generally one mode of amphistomatous <lb/>species and another mode of hypostomatous species (hyperstomatous in the case of <lb/>Poaceae). I also opted to tradeoff the precision of a biophysical diffusion model for a <lb/>more general, albeit realistic, model with fewer parameters. Hence, the cost-benefit <lb/>model of stomatal ratio is true to the underlying physics but otherwise not strongly <lb/>dependent on specific assumptions. Future work will be needed to test if this more <lb/>general model is consistent with mechanistic biophysical models. The symbols used <lb/>in the model are summarized in Table 4. <lb/>I model selection on the logit of stomatal ratio (upper:total), which I denote S = <lb/>logit(SR) = log SR/(1−SR) , so that feasible trait variation (SR is constrained from <lb/>0 to 1) is continuous and unbounded. Fitness as a function of stomatal ratio depends <lb/>on the difference between the benefits (f (S)) minus the costs (g(S)). Therefore, <lb/>fitness as a function of stomatal ratio is: <lb/>W (S) = 1 + f (S) − g(S) <lb/>(2) <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>Based on biophysical theory [11, 13], I assume that there is an intermediate op-<lb/>timal stomatal ratio (S opt ) at which photosynthetic rate is maximized. Above and <lb/>below that optimum, photosynthetic rate decreases, which I modelled as a Gaussian <lb/>function: <lb/>f (S) = B max e − (S−S opt ) 2 <lb/>2σ 2 <lb/>(3) <lb/>B max defines the maximum fitness when S = S opt . σ 2 acts akin to a shape factor <lb/>when the function is viewed from a logit scale. When σ 2 is large, the benefit function <lb/>has an inverted-U shape. There are increasing returns to fitness of the first few upper <lb/>stomata, but diminishing returns to further increases in SR (Fig. 3A). In contrast, <lb/>when σ 2 is small, the benefit function is more bell-shaped; the fitness benefit of the <lb/>first few upper stomata is large, but with diminishing returns (Fig. 3C). <lb/>I assumed a linear cost (e.g. increased susceptibility to foliar pathogens [23]) for <lb/>each additional upper stomate. The total cost as a function of stomatal ratio is the <lb/>product of the total stomatal density, the stomatal ratio (upper:total density), and <lb/>the cost per upper stomate. I define the slope of the cost function as C max , which is <lb/>equal to the total stomatal density times the cost per upper stomate: <lb/>h(SR) = C max SR <lb/>(4) <lb/>On a logit scale, the total cost asymptotically approaches C max : <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>g(S) = <lb/>C max <lb/>1 + e −S <lb/>(5) <lb/>If more were known about the cost of having upper stomata, a more realistic model <lb/>could be constructed. Without such knowledge, I believe it is judicious to start with <lb/>the simplest model that makes few assumptions and therefore could apply to a large <lb/>number of particular underlying mechanisms. Substituting Eqs 3 and 5 into Eq 2, <lb/>fitness as a function of S is: <lb/>W (S) = 1 + B max e − (S−S opt ) 2 <lb/>2σ 2 <lb/>− <lb/>C max <lb/>1 + e −S <lb/>(6) <lb/>Note that if the cost function were applied to lower rather than upper stomata, as <lb/>might be the case for specialized taxa such as aquatic plants, then one could obtain <lb/>the same results, except that hyper-rather than hypostomy would prevail, as in the <lb/>Poaceae data. The fitness function is maximized where the marginal benefit of the <lb/>next upper stomate is equal to the marginal cost: <lb/>df (S) <lb/>dS <lb/>= <lb/>dg(S) <lb/>dS <lb/>(7) <lb/>I did not obtain an analytical solution, so instead I used the optim function in R <lb/>[63] to numerically solve for the stomatal ratio that maximized fitness (S fit ) under <lb/>varying ratios of fitness cost (C max ) to benefit (B max ). I tuned the benefit:cost ratio <lb/>by fixing B max to 1 and varying C max between 0.01 and 100. I also varied the <lb/>shape factor σ 2 between 0.1 and 10, which appeared to capture the full range of <lb/>relevant model behaviour. For all numerical solutions, I assumed that the optimal <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>stomatal ratio for photosynthesis was 0.5, hence S opt = 0 on a logit scale. Next, <lb/>I generated hypothetical trait distributions under a scenario where the benefit:cost <lb/>ratio varies uniformly from 10 −2 to 10 2 . I solved for S fit with 10 4 evenly spaced <lb/>values of B max : C max under low, medium, and high values of σ 2 . R code for finding <lb/>numerical solutions is available from Dryad [62]. <lb/>Testing adaptive hypotheses for stomatal ratio using phyloge-<lb/>netic regression <lb/>I tested for an association between stomatal ratio, leaf thickness, mean annual pre-<lb/>cipitation, elevation, leaf area index, and growth form using type 2 phylogenetic <lb/>ANOVA with both categorical (Growth form) and continuous (e.g. leaf thickness) <lb/>predictor variables. For this analysis I quantified stomatal ratio as min(upper den-<lb/>sity, lower density):max(upper density, lower density). In this form, stomatal ratio <lb/>equals 1 when the densities on each surface are the same, and goes to 0 as the distri-<lb/>bution become more asymmetrical (hypostomy or hyperstomy). Note that this form <lb/>differs from what I use in analyzing multimodality because I wanted to specifically <lb/>test which factors favour the phososynthetically optimal distribution (amphistomy) <lb/>versus suboptimal distributions (either hypo-or hyperstomy). I accounted for phy-<lb/>logeny using a Phylomatic [64] megatree for this relatively large and phylogenet-<lb/>ically extensive dataset. To examine whether results were robust to phylogenetic <lb/>correction, I analyzed the data using three methods: Brownian motion (high phy-<lb/>logenetic signal), Pagel&apos;s λ (intermediate phylogenetic signal), and no phylogenetic <lb/>signal (normal ANOVA). For the intermediate signal model, I estimated Pagel&apos;s λ <lb/>using maximum likelihood. Phylogenetic models were fit using phylogenetic least <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 3. Selection is sufficient to explain why intermediate phenotypes are <lb/>universally unfit and the adaptive landscape is rugged. Panels A.-C.: In <lb/>each panel, a benefit function (solid line, see Eq 3) is shown with three different cost <lb/>functions (dashed line, see Eq 5 ). In all panels, B max is fixed at 1 and three slopes <lb/>of the cost function, C max are illustrated: 0.1 (shallow slope), 1 (medium slope), <lb/>and 10 (steep slope). The fitness benefit is always maximized when stomatal ratio <lb/>is 0.5 (amphistomy), corresponding to S opt = 0 on a logit scale. The shape factor <lb/>σ 2 changes the benefit function from bell-shaped in A. to an inverted-U shape in <lb/>C. Panels D.-F. show that the shape of the benefit function affects the topography <lb/>of the adaptive landscape. Solid lines are the stomatal ratio that optimizes fitness <lb/>(S fit ) as a function of the benefit:cost ratio (B max : C max ). When the benefits are high <lb/>compared to costs, amphistomy (stomatal ratio = 0.5) is favoured; when the costs are <lb/>high, hypostomy is favoured (stomatal ratio = 0). However, the transition between <lb/>these extremes can be abrupt when the landscape is rugged (panel D.) or gradual <lb/>when the landscape is smooth (panel F.).

Models [11, 13] and experiments [14] demon-<lb/>strate that the path length from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts can impose a <lb/>large constraint on photosynthesis, especially when leaf thickness exceeds approx-<lb/>imately 300 µm. Several studies have found a positive correlation between leaf <lb/>thickness and amphistomy [11, 20, 66, 67, 68, 59, 44], but the evidence is equiv-<lb/>ocal [69, 12, 43]. <lb/>H2: Light <lb/>A second hypothesis is that amphistomy is favoured in high light, open environments <lb/>because CO 2 becomes more limiting at high irradiance. H1 and H2 are difficult to <lb/>disentangle, and could even reinforce one another, because leaf thickness increases <lb/>under high irradiance [70]. However, several studies have argued that the light en-<lb/>vironment, rather than leaf thickness, is the primary factor affecting selection on <lb/>amphistomy [19, 71, 18, 12, 20, 21]. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">H3: Precipitation <lb/>Wood [17] observed that amphistomy was common in Australian deserts. Although <lb/>amphistomy is sometimes common in dry environments, most studies conclude that <lb/>precipitation is indirectly correlated with amphistomy because drier habitats also <lb/>tend to be more open [19, 21]. Nevertheless, the fact that amphistomy can increase <lb/>water-use efficiency [11, 72] suggests that it might be favoured in dry habitats, inde-<lb/>pendent of other factors. <lb/>H4: Altitude <lb/>Anatomical surveys demonstrate that amphistomy is sometimes more common in <lb/>high elevation communities compared to nearby low elevation communities [73, 74, <lb/>75], possibly because lower CO 2 partial pressures place a greater premium on effi-<lb/>cient diffusion. However, this hypothesis is complicated by the fact that diffusion <lb/>coefficients are higher at elevation because the air is thinner [76], meaning that CO 2 <lb/>diffusion could actually be less limiting. <lb/>H5: Growth form <lb/>Independent of leaf anatomy and the abiotic environment, the strength of selection <lb/>on photosynthetic rate might be stronger among certain growth forms (e.g. forbs <lb/>vs. trees) because of their different life history strategies. Salisbury (1927) noted <lb/>qualitatively that herbs tended to amphistomatous, an observation later confirmed <lb/>by Peat and Fitter (1994). However, other reviews have argued that stomatal ratio <lb/></div>

			<page>54 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">is not closely connected with any particular growth form [32, 12]. <lb/>Two hypotheses I have not considered because of methodological limitations are <lb/>that amphistomy is associated with vertically-oriented, isobilateral leaves [32] and <lb/>that amphistomy, by doubling the conductive leaf surface area, relieves a constraint <lb/>the stomatal size-density tradeoff [77, 59]. I did not have sufficient, reliable informa-<lb/>tion on leaf orientation and guard cell size to evaluate these hypotheses. <lb/>Costs of upper stomata <lb/>This study reaffirms at a global scale that most species are hypostomatous. The <lb/>most parsimonious explanation for the preponderance of hypostomy is that there <lb/>is cost to having stomata on the upper surface of the leaf. A fitness cost associ-<lb/>ated with increased evaporation [78] cannot explain the dearth of stomata on the <lb/>upper leaf surface, though this explanation occasionally appears in the literature <lb/>[79]. In fact, amphistomy is common in some dry habitats [17, 11, 19, 20] and am-<lb/>phistomatous plants can be functionally hypostomatous when stressed by regulating <lb/>stomatal aperture differentially on each surface [80, 81, 82, 72]. Although amphis-<lb/>tomatous plants can be functionally hypostomatous, the reverse is not true. Hence, <lb/>anatomical amphistomy should be favoured whenever the capacity to be functionally <lb/>amphistomatous is advantageous. <lb/>Besides evaporation, several fitness costs have been suggested, including decreased <lb/>water-use efficiency of amphistomy in large leaves [11], photodamage to guard cell <lb/>chloroplasts (W.K. Smith, pers. comm.), occlusion of upper stomata by water block-<lb/>age [83], and increased susceptibility to foliar pathogens [13]. Increased evaporation <lb/></div>

			<page>55 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">is an unlikely explanation since so many desert species are anatomically amphis-<lb/>tomatous (see above), but to my knowledge, most other hypotheses have not been <lb/>rigorously tested. However, [23] showed that adaxial (upper) stomata pore area, but <lb/>not abaxial (lower) pore area, was strongly correlated with susceptibility to a rust <lb/>pathogen. Hence, the pathogen susceptibility hypothesis is best supported by the <lb/>current data. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Text S3: An evolutionary process model for propor-<lb/>tion traits <lb/>Making evolutionary sense of a biological pattern requires an underlying process <lb/>model to provide the theoretical foundation on which data analysis rests. A powerful <lb/>approach in macroevolution involves modelling trait evolution on adaptive landscapes <lb/>where the peaks of high fitness evolve with or without constraint [28, 104, 105]. If <lb/>models with constraint describe the data better than those without, then there is <lb/>compelling evidence that the adaptive landscape is shaped by some combination of <lb/>selective, genetic, functional, or developmental constraints. Furthermore, the adap-<lb/>tive landscape may change under multiple selective regimes, meaning that a trait <lb/>is best described by a mixture of distributions, each generated under separate se-<lb/>lective regimes [27, 29, 30]. Current evolutionary process models such as Brownian <lb/>motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck assume that traits follow a Gaussian distribution, <lb/>but this is clearly inappropriate for traits like stomatal ratio. In this text, I modify <lb/>previous evolutionary process models to accommodate proportion traits and derive <lb/>the expected pattern given adaptive landscapes that are constrained versus those <lb/>that are unconstrained. This model provides a strong theoretical foundation for the <lb/>model-based statistical inference described in Text S4.

Let ∆N T,t = N T (t + 1) − N T (t) be the change in total <lb/>stomatal number that must be made up of changes in upper stomata, lower stomata, <lb/>or some combination of both. I assume that the contribution to ∆N T,t from upper <lb/>and lower stomata is proportional to their density. For reasons explained below, I <lb/>define ν = N T (t + 1) as the total stomata at time t + 1. The transition rate u ij from <lb/>N U = i upper stomata at time t to N U = j upper stomata at time t + 1 is binomially <lb/>distributed with a rate determined by the stomatal ratio r: <lb/>u ij = <lb/>ν <lb/>j <lb/>r j (1 − r) ν−j j ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , ν} <lb/>(S1) <lb/>Note that stomatal ratio here is defined as the proportion of upper stomata, r = <lb/>N U /(N U + N L ) = N U /N T = N U /ν.

When ν is large, the distribution can be approximated with <lb/>a normal distribution and a diffusion approximation can be used to model the long <lb/>term evolution of the trait. This diffusion process is analogous to Brownian motion, <lb/>except that the trait is bounded by 0 and 1. It is also mathematically equivalent <lb/>to one-locus, two-allele population genetic models of neutral evolution (see [106] for <lb/>a detailed derivation). I will make reference to results from this literature without <lb/>rigorously deriving them here. In particular, it has been shown that the stationary <lb/>distribution of the diffusion is: <lb/>f (r) = <lb/>e A(r) c 1 e −A(r) dr + c 2 <lb/>V δx <lb/>(S4) <lb/>where <lb/>A(r) = <lb/>2M δx <lb/>V δx <lb/>dr <lb/>(S5) <lb/>M δx = 0 <lb/>(S6) <lb/>V δx = <lb/>r(1 − r) <lb/>ν <lb/>(S7) <lb/></div>

			<page>61 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">and the time scale is in units of ν −1 . Thus, ν can be interpreted as a diffusion <lb/>coefficient without necessarily specifying a genetic or developmental mechanism that <lb/>governs the amount of variance in stomatal ratio from one time to the next. Solving <lb/>for f (r) without selection on stomatal ratio yields: <lb/>f (r) = <lb/>6 <lb/>r(1 − r) <lb/>(S8) <lb/>Thus, without selection on stomatal ratio, most species should be hypo-or hyper-<lb/>stomatous (Fig. S3). Next, I modify the model to include stabilizing selection around <lb/>a long-run average θ, which may be interpreted as a peak in the adaptive landscape <lb/>under a single selective regime. This process model is analogous to an Ornstein-<lb/>Uhlenbeck process for a bounded trait. I again use the diffusion approximation, but <lb/>this time the drift and diffusion coefficients are: <lb/>M δx = α(θ − r) <lb/>(S9) <lb/>V δx = <lb/>r(1 − r) <lb/>ν <lb/>(S10) <lb/>α is the return rate to θ.

In this section I derive the likelihood functions and describe an expectation-<lb/>maximization algorithm to find the maximum likelihood mixture model given the <lb/>data. R code to implement these methods is available on Dryad [62]. In general, <lb/>finite mixture distributions are the summation of k ≥ 2 mixture components (i.e. <lb/>probability distributions) with density f i (x) and mixture weight w i : <lb/>g(x; k) = <lb/>k <lb/>i=1 <lb/>w i f i (x) <lb/>(S15) <lb/>Here the i-th mixture component has a probability density f i (x) given by the <lb/>stationary distribution in Eq S14 with parameters θ i , φ i .
