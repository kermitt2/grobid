Polyglycosyl chains (3) or polylactosaminoglycans (4) <lb/>have been described to occur on erythrocytes, (1,3) teratocar-<lb/>cinoma cells ( 5 ) , granulocytes (6), and pheochromocytoma <lb/>cells (7).

			<body>tion of relevance with regard to the present contribution came <lb/>from compositional analyses suggesting that the high molec-<lb/>ular weight glycoproteins, excluded from Sephacryl S400 in <lb/>the presence of 4 M guanidinium chloride and designated as <lb/>mucins, were actually devoid of D-mannOSe. The total yield <lb/>of mucins calculated for 1 liter of human milk was 70 mg. <lb/>Isolation of mucin-derived glycopeptides (250 mg) from a <lb/>Pronase digest of crude human casein was achieved by phenol, <lb/>6 M urea extraction. The crude glycopeptide mixture was <lb/>further fractionated by gel exclusion chromatography on Bio-<lb/>Gel P-30 as shown in Fig. 1. Monosaccharide analyses of <lb/>fractions A-D revealed only traces of D-mannose on large <lb/>glycopeptides (fraction A), whereas a considerable content of <lb/>D-mannose was measured in fractions C and D indicating N -<lb/>glycan carrying glycopeptides, which may have originated <lb/>from contaminating whey glycoproteins (Table 1). Large gly-<lb/>copeptides in fraction A (50 mg) or mucins were subjected to <lb/>alkaline borohydride treatment. <lb/>0.8-<lb/>04 -<lb/>0.4. <lb/>0.2-<lb/>0 <lb/>U <lb/>C <lb/>$ <lb/>$ 10&apos; <lb/>0.5. <lb/>i&quot;&quot;&quot; <lb/>I <lb/>b <lb/>+e <lb/>30 <lb/>3 100 <lb/>fraction number <lb/>FIG. 1.

Elution was performed with a flow rate of 24 ml/h <lb/>and 3-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed by the <lb/>thiobarbituric acid method for their content of sialic acid (absorbance <lb/>at 549 nm, 0 ) or by enzyme immunoassay of 5 0 -~l aliquots using <lb/>monoclonal antibodies 115C2 (absorbance at 405 nm, 0) or Leu M1 <lb/>(absorbance at.405 nm, . . . .). <lb/>Immunochemical Characterization of Carbohydrate Antigens <lb/>Expressed on Mucins or Mucin-derived Glycopeptides <lb/>Antigen patterns on mucins and mucin-derived glycopep-<lb/>tides were analyzed using a series of monoclonal antibodies <lb/>with defined carbohydrate epitopes in enzyme assays or radio-<lb/>immunoassays (Table 2). Fractionation of Pronase-stable gly-<lb/>copeptides on Bio-Gel P-30 was registered by measuring an-<lb/>tigen activities Le&quot;-X or X, respectively: <lb/>GalP(1-3)GlcNAcfl(l-3)Gal~(1-4)GlcNAc <lb/>4 <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Fuca <lb/>Fuca <lb/>I <lb/>I <lb/>defined by monoclonal antibody 115 C2, and <lb/>Galfl(1-4)GlcNAc <lb/>3 <lb/>I <lb/>1 <lb/>Fuca <lb/>defined by monoclonal antibody Leu M1. <lb/>The activity profiles in Fig. 1 suggest that both isomeric <lb/>terminal sequences are coexpressed and restricted to large <lb/>glycopeptides contained in fraction A. Le*-X distribution on <lb/>large and smaller-sized glycopeptides may represent 0-glycan <lb/>elution, since this hybrid of type 1-and type 2-based struc-<lb/>tures has never been found to occur on N-glycans but is a <lb/>regular constituent of secreted mucins and mucin-derived <lb/>oligosaccharide alditols3 (19). Concerning the latter, 2 pg of <lb/>fractions MM-MS or MM-DS (see &quot;Experimental Proce-<lb/>dures&quot;) compared with 10 pg of fraction MM-N were able to <lb/>inhibit 50% of 115 C2 binding in enzyme immunoassay. <lb/>Milk mucins and mucin-derived glycopeptides, moreover, <lb/>exhibit antigen activities T (defined by antibody 49H8), H2 <lb/>(defined by antibody A46-B/B10), sialyl-Le&quot; (defined by an-<lb/>tibody NS 19-9) and Lea, Leb (defined by antibodies Le&quot; 01 or <lb/>Leb 01, respectively). Antigen sialyl dimeric X (defined <lb/>by <lb/>monoclonal antibody FH6) was not detectable on mucin-0-<lb/>glycans. <lb/>Human breast carcinoma-associated antigens <lb/>MCA (20) <lb/>(&gt;50 units/mg) and Ca 15-3 (21) (230 units/mg) are coex-<lb/>pressed on skim milk mucins together with the previously <lb/>detected tumor markers Ca 19-9 and Ca 125 (9). <lb/>Neutral Oligosaccharides from Milk Mucins and Mucin-<lb/>derived, Large Glycopeptides <lb/>0-glycan liberation from mucins or glycopeptides by alka-<lb/>line reductive treatment provided a mixture of oligosaccharide <lb/>alditols, which was fractionated by ion-exchange chromatog-<lb/>raphy on DEAE-Sephadex A25 followed by high performance <lb/>liquid chromatography on primary amine bonded phase (Fig. <lb/>2). Independent of the source, neutral alditols representing <lb/>-50% of total carbohydrates released from large glycopeptides <lb/>or mucins (20-30 mg) comprized a t least 30 different species <lb/>ranging in size from 2 to 16 monosaccharides. Major compo-<lb/>nents were nonfucosylated species resistant to mild trichlo-<lb/>roacetic acid treatment, which eluted in fractions MM-N4, <lb/>MM-N6, MM-N8, MM-N10, and MM-Nl2. As judged from <lb/>the HPLC profiles the molar proportions estimated for each <lb/>component contained in the fraction of neutral alditols were <lb/>similar for mucin-and glycopeptide-derived oligosaccharides <lb/>(Table 3 and Fig. 2). <lb/>F.-G.

Methylation analysis confirmed the presence of <lb/>both GlcNAc substitution isomers 3,6-di-O-methyl-N-meth-<lb/>ylacetamido-2-deoxyglucitol and 4,6-di-O-methyl-N-methyl-<lb/>acetamido-2-deoxyglucitol (Table 6). Branching at the ter-<lb/>minal alditol is revealed by formation of 1,4,5-tri-O-methyl-<lb/>N-methylacetamido-2-deoxygalactitol and by the absence of <lb/>the primary fragment ion at m/z 276 in the El-mass spectrum. <lb/>6-Mono-0-substitution of internal galactose is indicated by <lb/>2,3,4-tri-O-methy1-1,5,6-tri-O-acetyl galactitol formed on <lb/>methylation analysis as the only tri-0-acetylated hexitol (Ta-<lb/>ble 6 and Fig. 6).

Based <lb/>on the above-presented combined data, the primary structure <lb/>of the major saccharide alditol in MM-N6 is proposed as: <lb/>Gal(1, <lb/>3) <lb/>Gal(l-3/4)GlcNAc(l, <lb/>6) <lb/>GalNAc-ol <lb/>G)Gal(l-4)GlcNAc(l&apos; <lb/>Fraction MM-N8&quot;The major oligosaccharide alditol in <lb/>permethylated fraction MM-N8 is characterized by the pseu-<lb/>domolecular ions M + H at m/z 1859 and M + Na at mlz <lb/>1881 in FAB-mass spectrometry (Fig. 2; and Table 4) and <lb/>with reference to a monosaccharide analysis is calculated to <lb/>have the composition Ga14GlcNAc3GalNAc-01.

Since the <lb/>alditols had been isolated from pooled milk samples of indi-<lb/>viduals with undefined secretory status and Lewis blood <lb/>groups, substitution of terminal Gal@(l-3/4)GlcNAc should <lb/>reflect the genetic distribution of Se and Le genes. Accord-<lb/>ingly, the primary fragment ion at m/z 638, detected in <lb/>fractions MM-N9 to MM-N14, represents terminal trisaccha-<lb/>ride dHexHexHexNAc, a major portion being assumed to <lb/>contain the structural element Fuca(l-2)Gal, as normally <lb/>found in secretors. <lb/>Pseudomolecular ions and primary fragment ions in FAB-<lb/>MS corroborated the presence of mono-, di-, and trifuco-<lb/>sylated oligosaccharide alditols (Tables 4 and 7). Based on <lb/>the respective series of primary fragment ions, the possible <lb/>sites of fucosylation along the polylactosamine chain are <lb/>shown in Table 7. <lb/>&apos;H NMR Spectroscopy <lb/>Fractions MM-N4, -N6, and -N8 were analyzed by one-<lb/>111 1 <lb/>h <lb/>h <lb/>Vlll 1 <lb/>and two-dimensional &apos;H NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz (Fig. <lb/>7 and Table 8). The GalNAc-01-1 resonances for these three <lb/>fractions are almost identical and differ only little from those <lb/>assigned by Mutsaers et al. (25) for a GalNAc-ol residue <lb/>having the same proximal environment. The 2 terminal Gal <lb/>residues linked to different aglycons show slightly different <lb/>Hl-H2-H3-H4 connectivity paths in the two-dimensional <lb/>spectrum of MM-N4. All Gal and GlcNAc residues have a 0 <lb/>configuration, as follows from their 3J1,2 coupling constants <lb/>The substitution patterns of Gal and GlcNAc residues in <lb/>MM-N6 and -N8 were elucidated with the aid of the previ-<lb/>ously established regularities concerning glycosylation-in-<lb/>duced shifts. It was observed (26, 27) that glycosylation in-<lb/>duces marked downfield shifts for the protons at the substi-<lb/>tution site and at both vicinal sites, but leaves other proton <lb/>resonances much less, or not at all, affected. This was recently <lb/>confirmed by the data reported by Baumann et al. (28). <lb/>Consequently, since the chemical shifts of Gal-I11 H2, H3, <lb/>and H4 are practically identical for MM-N4, -N6, and -N8, <lb/>these protons are obviously located at hydroxylated carbons, <lb/>which means that C6 must be glycosylated (the same refers <lb/>to Gal-V of MM-N8).

			<body>sion of the data on MS and methylation analysis, the samples <lb/>were heterogeneous, and the 2,4-di-O-methyl galactitol found <lb/>for both MM-N6 and -N8 (Table 6) requires that about 10% <lb/>of Gal residues present in the samples are 3,6-diglycosylated. <lb/>This, in turn, would require that Gal H4 signal be shifted <lb/>from the 3.92 ppm into the 4.13-4.15 ppm region, where H4 <lb/>resonances of 3,6-diglycosylated Gal residues have been found <lb/>for oligosaccharides obtained from human <lb/>milk (29) and <lb/>erythrocytes (30) and that Gal H3 signal be shifted to 3.72 <lb/>ppm, as shown in Ref. 29. As a matter of fact, a very weak <lb/>cross-peak at 4.14/3.73 ppm was found in the COSY spectrum <lb/>of MM-N6, but in that of MM-N8, the corresponding contour <lb/>was barely above the noise level. Due to the small amount of <lb/>the substances investigated (see &quot;Experimental Procedures&quot;), <lb/>it is not unexpected that the proof of 10% of a constituent of <lb/>a microheterogeneous system may be problematic. <lb/>Concerning the 3 uersus 4 linkage to a GlcNAc residue, it <lb/>is the H2 resonance which is diagnostic, since in the former <lb/>case it should be shifted toward lower field due to the neigh-<lb/>borhood of the glycosylated C3. In the COSY spectrum of <lb/>MM-N6 (Table 8), one of the two GlcNAc H2 resonances is <lb/>practically identical with that found for MM-N4 (3.75 uersus <lb/>3.760 ppm), whereas the other one is shifted <lb/>by 0.15 ppm <lb/>toward lower field (to 3.90 ppm), pointing to a 1-3 terminal <lb/>linkage. Again, this is confirmed by the data on several human <lb/>milk oligosaccharides (29), whose GlcNAc H2 resonances were <lb/>found a t 3.76 and 3.88-3.90 ppm for the Galp(1-4)GlcNAc <lb/>and Galp( l-3)GlcNAc fragments, respectively, and also by <lb/>the results obtained for glycopeptides derived from calf fe-<lb/>tuin, whose corresponding GlcNAc H2 chemical shifts were <lb/>3.79 uersus 3.89 ppm (27). The GlcNAc H2/H1 correlations <lb/>of MM-N6 were found at almost identical shifts for MM-N8, <lb/>but, in addition, the <lb/>high field H2 resonance exhibited a <lb/>correlation to a new H 1 resonance (3.757/4.589 ppm) of one <lb/>proton intensity, thus showing that the molecule contains one <lb/>more internal Galp(1-4)GlcNAc disaccharide unit. The above <lb/>analysis applies to the main component of each of the three <lb/>fractions investigated. However, due to the heterogeneity of <lb/>the samples, a number of minor NMR signals occur along <lb/>with those referring to the dominant component. One <lb/>of these <lb/>weak signals in the one-dimensional spectrum of MM-N6 (at <lb/>4.605 ppm; not mentioned in Table 8) is probably due to a <lb/>-25% admixture of molecules containing a terminal Galp <lb/>(l-4)GlcNAc disaccharide fragment. In the two-dimensional <lb/>spectrum, a H1/H2 cross-peak at 4.57/3.67 ppm points to <lb/>some admixture of species containing terminal GlcNAc resi-<lb/>dues. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study presents structural evidence for the organ char-<lb/>acteristic expression of highly clustered O-glycosidically <lb/>linked polylactosaminoglycans on mucins of human skim <lb/>milk. These mucins had <lb/>previously been demonstrated to <lb/>carry oncofetal carbohydrate antigens Ca 19-9 and Ca 125 (9) <lb/>and are presumed to be related antigenically and structurally <lb/>to a high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein isolated <lb/>from human milk fat globules3 (31). Similar mucin-like gly-<lb/>coproteins on human milk fat globule membranes have been <lb/>reported by Shimizu and Yamaguchi (32), Ormerod et at. (33), <lb/>and Krohn et al. (34), who also demonstrated an antigenic <lb/>relationship to secreted <lb/>mucins or high molecular weight <lb/>glycoproteins of skim milk (33, 34). As human milk fat glob-<lb/>ular membranes originate from the apical cell membrane of <lb/>milk-secreting cells, these soluble mucins of skim milk may <lb/>serve as a model for studies on organ-characteristic O-glycan <lb/>structure and biosynthesis in mammary epithelial cells. <lb/>The mucins of human skim milk have previously been <lb/>shown to precipitate with the casein fraction at pH 4.6 and <lb/>to contain -70% of mannose-free, alkali-labile carbohydrates <lb/>(9). Large glycopeptides with clustered <lb/>O-glycans could be <lb/>separated from a Pronase digest of crude caseins exhibiting <lb/>the same pattern of carbohydrate antigens and reductively <lb/>cleaved oligosaccharide alditols as skim milk mucins. The 0-<lb/>glycans characterized in this study are definitely not derived <lb/>from K-casein, as may be argued, since this highly glycosylated <lb/>glycoprotein of human casein could be separated from the <lb/>mucins according to its size (9) and has been demonstrated <lb/>to be devoid of antigenic activities Ca 19-9, Ca 125, and Ca <lb/>15-3 (9).3 Moreover, O-glycans of human K-casein have been <lb/>studied by JollGs and co-workers (35, 3G), who could charac-<lb/>terize a series of smaller-sized oligosaccharides. Despite this, <lb/>there is evidently also no relation to secretory immunoglob-<lb/>ulin A contained in human whey (37, 38) or to proteoglycans <lb/>secreted by mammary epithelial cells (39). On the other hand, <lb/>O-glycans with repetitive lactosamine exceeding 3 units, <lb/>which accordingly may be designated as polylactosaminogly-<lb/>cans, have not been described so far on a chemical basis, <lb/>whether in human milk nor in any other source of human or <lb/>animal origin. Childs et at. (8), however, have demonstrated <lb/>polylactosamino-O-glycans to occur on human leucocyte com-<lb/>mon antigen, and Fukuda et al. (40) were able to chemically <lb/>characterize minor O-linked oligosaccharides with repetitive <lb/>lactosamine (up to 3 units) on normal human granulocytes. <lb/>In a recent publication Wu et al. (41) described a sulfated <lb/>polysaccharide of high molecular weight <lb/>O-glycosidically <lb/>linked to an ovarian cyst glycoprotein, which proved to be <lb/>related to highly branched polylactosamines. <lb/>The unique structural aspects of major polylactosamino-0-<lb/>glycans on skim milk mucins may be summarized as follows: <lb/>1) the carbohydrate chains <lb/>comprize up to 16 (or more) <lb/>monosaccharide units; 2) the core structures are of the com-<lb/>mon type 2 Gal~(l-3)[GlcNAc~(l-6)]GalNAc; 3) the polylac-<lb/>tosamine sequence of major species is unbranched; 4) the <lb/>repetitive N-acetyllactosamine units are linearly linked via <lb/>0 -6 of the galactose residues; and 5 ) another major portion of <lb/>polylactosamine sequences is branched via 3,6 di-O-substi-<lb/>tuted galactose. <lb/>The structural aspects stated <lb/>in points 3 and 4 are of <lb/>considerable interest with respect to the biosynthesis and <lb/>immunochemistry of polylactosamine-type carbohydrates. As <lb/>has been pointed out by Schachter (42), the known p6 GlcNAc <lb/>transferases responsible for synthesis of mucin core types 2 <lb/>and 4 and the branch point of the blood group I determinant <lb/>require an 0-3 substitution of their target sugar. Taking this <lb/>into account, the P3GlcNAc transferase (&quot;extension enzyme&quot;) <lb/>would have to act before the P6-GlcNAc transferase (&quot;branch-<lb/>ing enzyme&quot;) (43). <lb/>Accordingly, unbranched carbohydrate <lb/>chains of the polylactosamine type, as described in the present <lb/>paper, exhibiting 6-mono-0-substitution of internal galactose <lb/>residues are hardly to be expected as regular biosynthetic <lb/>products, if the &quot;3 before 6 rule&quot; is of general validity. Core <lb/>oligosaccharides with the <lb/>common structural element <lb/>GlcNAcp( l-G)GalNAc-ol have been described recently to oc-<lb/>cur on human glycoproteins from meconium, K-casein, and <lb/>seminal plasma (44,35, 45) pointing to the possible existence <lb/>of a p6GlcNAc transferase in human tissues, which is inde-<lb/>pendent from 0 -3 substitution of its target sugars GalNAc or <lb/>Gal, respectively. <lb/>Cold agglutinins of the anti-I,i family have been demon-<lb/>strated to define polylactosamine sequences with <lb/>branched <lb/>(I-antigen) or linearly extented backbones (i-antigen) (46). <lb/>Reactivity of anti-I or anti-i antibodies with the novel type of <lb/>backbone structure exhibiting unbranched polylactosamine <lb/>sequences with a structural element of branched chains re-<lb/></body>

			<body>mains to be investigated. <lb/>A comparison of the major oligosaccharides found on mu-<lb/>cins from seminal plasma and skim milk reveals that the <lb/>former are represented by short carbohydrate chains (di-to <lb/>hexasaccharides) with prominent fucosylated or sialylated <lb/>species (45, 47) (Fig. 5 ) . This is in accordance with the high <lb/>activities of fucosykransferases and, to a lesser extent, of <lb/>sialyltransferases, measured in human seminal plasma (48), <lb/>which block chain elongation mainly on the tetrasaccharide <lb/>level. Milk mucin-producing cells on the other hand probably <lb/>exhibit high activities of a P6-GlcNAc transferase, thus pro-<lb/>ducing long carbohydrate chains of the polylactosamine type, <lb/>which may later become fucosylated or sialylated to a minor <lb/>extent. <lb/>Several biological functions of these polylactosamine-ex-<lb/>pressing mucins in human milk may be postulated, particu-<lb/>larly a protective role within the digestive tract of the newborn <lb/>infants. Mucins have been reported to stimulate lysozyme <lb/>activity (49), to enhance the growth of Bifidus flora in the <lb/>intestine (49), and to bind pathogenic microorganisms via <lb/>their surface l e c t i n~.~ <lb/>Coexpression of human cancer antigens MCA (20) and Ca <lb/>15-3 (21) on skim milk mucins of lactating women and their <lb/>detection in the sera of patients suffering from metastatic <lb/>breast carcinoma suggests that the respective carbohydrate <lb/>sequences belong to the family of oncodevelopmental antigens <lb/>and that they may be located on members of the mucin-0-<lb/>glycan series characterized in this study. A possible functional <lb/>role of 1,i-active polylactosamine-0-glycans on skim milk <lb/>mucins with regard to the metastatic process of epithelial <lb/>mammary tumors directed to the human liver is currently <lb/>under investigation. <lb/></body>
