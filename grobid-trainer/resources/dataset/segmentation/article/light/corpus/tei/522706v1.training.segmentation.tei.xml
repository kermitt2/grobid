			<front>Abstract <lb/>Aim <lb/>To evaluate vibrotactile perception thresholds in people with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) <lb/>and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in relation to other sensory tests. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Nerve function was evaluated in 36 and 42 participants with NGT and T2DM, respectively <lb/>[mean age 70.0 (1.2) years; males n=40, females n=38]. The mean duration of T2DM was <lb/>12.3 (7.3) years. Vibration perception thresholds were measured at four frequencies (8, 16, 32 <lb/>and 125 Hz) bilaterally on the sole of the foot at first and fifth metatarsal heads using <lb/>Multifrequency vibrametry and compared to vibration perception thresholds using <lb/>Biothesiometer (128 Hz) bilaterally (medial malleolus and distal dorsal bony surface of great <lb/>toes), touch sensation with Semmes-Weinstein monofilament bilaterally (10 g) at three sites <lb/>on the sole of foot (distal great toe and 1 st and 5 th metatarsal heads), electrophysiology <lb/>(amplitude and conduction velocity of sural nerve; right side) and thermal sensory testing (i.e. <lb/>small diameter nerve fibers; method of limits using Thermotest®). <lb/>Results <lb/>Vibration perception and temperature thresholds in the foot and sural nerve function were <lb/>different between the NGT and T2DM categories. Measuring vibration perception thresholds <lb/>at lower frequencies with Multifrequency vibrametry, compared to Biothesiometer, both <lb/>provided similar correlations to the amplitude of the sural nerve. Temperature thresholds did <lb/>also correlate with vibration perception thresholds and with sural nerve function. Only 4/42 <lb/>participants with T2DM showed pathology by monofilament test, none with NGT. <lb/></front>

			<front>Conclusions <lb/>Vibration perception thresholds have a fair correlation to amplitude of the sural nerve, even <lb/>when measured at a non-tactile surface. Thus in the present study, measuring vibration <lb/>perception threshold at a tactile surface does not seem to provide any clear advantage over the <lb/>traditional way of measuring vibration perception on the medial malleolus. In people with <lb/>T2DM, both large and small diameter nerve fibers seem to be affected. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Vibrotactile perception at tactile surfaces on the feet are important for somatic function [1,2] <lb/>and may be affected early in various neuropathies [3]. In diabetes type 2 (T2DM), peripheral <lb/>neuropathy is a well-known long-term complication, occurring in up to 50% of people with <lb/>T2DM [4,5]. Symptoms of neuropathy are often present even at the time of diagnosis. <lb/>[4,6,7,8,9]. Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy in the feet promotes the risk of <lb/>foot ulcers, infection, and at times even the need for limb amputation [10,11]. Loss of <lb/>sensation and decreased balance can lead to increased risk of falls and tissue injury [10] and <lb/>more than a third of those with T2DM and diabetic sensory-motor polyneuropathy develop <lb/>neuropathic pain, which significantly impairs their quality of life [4]. In Sweden, screening <lb/>examination for retinopathy and neuropathy, the latter using monofilament test and vibrating <lb/>tuning fork, are recommended annually in people with T2DM [12] and is efficient in view of <lb/>health economy [13,14,15,16]. However, the sensitivity of the screening examination is low <lb/>and will only screen out those with a manifest neuropathy or with a painful neuropathy [17]. <lb/>At an early stage, neuropathic changes may be reversible and with a more sensitive <lb/>instrument for screening examination, the risk for complications could be reduced by early <lb/>detection [18,19,20]. With invasive methods, such as electrophysiological assessment, <lb/>neuropathic changes are detectable even in the pre-diabetic stage e.g.. impaired glucose <lb/>tolerance [18,21]. A simple and non-invasive method for more sensitive everyday clinical <lb/>diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is warranted. <lb/>Vibrotactile perception depends on the function of Pacinian corpuscles, responding to <lb/>frequencies &gt; 80 Hz (in particular at 250 Hz [22]) and on Meissner´s corpuscles, which are <lb/>most sensitive at 30 Hz [23,24]. Vibration perception thresholds (VPTs) at different <lb/>frequencies, reflecting dysfunction in subsets of receptors and their connected axons, may be <lb/>a useful tool for detecting early signs of peripheral neuropathy. In clinical practice, <lb/></body>

			<body>vibrotactile perception is by tradition investigated by bone contact through the skin, at the <lb/>pre-tibia, at the medial malleolus and at the big toe at an arbitrarily pragmatic frequency of <lb/>128 Hz to detect neuropathy [25,26]. However, tactile surfaces may be more appropriate sites <lb/>to examine with respect to function [26,27,28]. For example, disturbed vibrotactile perception <lb/>in finger pulps has been reported in vibration-induced neuropathy and in carpal tunnel <lb/>syndrome [3,29]. Vibrotactile perception in the foot at different frequencies in a population <lb/>with T2DM has previously not been examined and compared to normative data in people with <lb/>normal glucose tolerance (NGT) [30], but has recently been reported in children with type 1 <lb/>diabetes, showing early signs of neuropathy [31]. Thus, our aim was to evaluate VPTs at <lb/>tactile surfaces on the sole of the foot bilaterally and to compare them with previously used <lb/>techniques to evaluate sensory nerve function in people with NGT and in people with T2DM <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Examinations were performed as part of a 10-year follow-up of a cohort originally from the <lb/>population-based Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) [32], with participants recruited <lb/>from November 2004 until April 2007; the original study population has been described <lb/>elsewhere [33]. At the 2014 follow-up, six of the original 119 participants were deceased, and <lb/>26 declined further participation. The remaining 87 participants with 36, 9, and 42 <lb/>participants in the NGT, IGT, and T2DM categories, underwent examination of vibratory <lb/>perception thresholds (VPTs). Due to the small sample size in the impaired glucose tolerance <lb/>group, these were excluded from further analyses. Thus, 78 participants were analyzed (Table <lb/>1). The glycemic status of individuals with NGT and IGT was verified by two standardized <lb/>oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) [34,35]. NGT was defined as a capillary fasting plasma <lb/>glucose &lt;6.1 mmol/l and a 2-hour plasma glucose &lt;7.8 mmol/l; IGT as fasting plasma <lb/>glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/l and a 2 hour plasma glucose ≥7.8 and &lt;11.1 mmol/l. Lastly, T2DM was <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of ≥7.0 mmol/l and/or a 2 hour plasma glucose <lb/>≥11.1 mmol/l as defined by the 1999 WHO criteria [34,35]. Glomerular filtration rate was <lb/>calculated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula where creatinine clearance= [(140-age) x <lb/>mass (kg) x constant) / serum creatinine (in µmol/l)]. The constant is 1.23 for men and 1.04 <lb/>for women. <lb/>Examination methods <lb/>Electrophysiological assessment <lb/>An experienced neurophysiologist, blinded to group identity for all participants, performed a <lb/>standardized nerve conduction assessment at the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at Umeå <lb/>University, Sweden. All measurements were conducted on the right leg, and included the <lb/>amplitude and conduction velocity of the sural nerve [17]. The conduction velocity of the <lb/>peroneal nerve was also measured, but was not analyzed further as it contains a larger <lb/>proportion of motor neurons than the sural nerve, which was thus deemed the most <lb/>appropriate target for evaluation of sensory nerve function. <lb/>Vibration perception thresholds <lb/>VPTs were measured with two different methods: 1) VibroSense Meter and 2) <lb/>Biothesiometer. 1) VPTs using VibroSense Meter were measured bilaterally on the sole of the <lb/>foot at two different locations, i.e. the first and fifth metatarsal head [31]. The sites were <lb/>selected to mirror the function of the median plantar branch of the tibial (first metatarsal head) <lb/>and the lateral plantar branch of the tibial (fifth metatarsal head). Measurements were <lb/>performed with a modified VibroSense Meter adopted for measurement on the feet [36]. The <lb/>thresholds were measured at four frequencies (8, 16, 32 and 125 Hz) at each site. The foot <lb/></body>

			<body>VibroSense Meter comprised of a modified hand device with an extended vibrating probe and <lb/>a special footplate with a hole, which was placed over the modified device as described (for <lb/>details, see Ising et al [31] and Dahlin et al [36]). The measuring procedure for the foot was <lb/>identical with the previously reported examination of the fingers; i.e. according to ISO13091-<lb/>1 [36]. The examination sequence on the sole of the foot was: 1) first metatarsal head, and 2) <lb/>fifth metatarsal head. The examination time was approximately 3 min/site; i.e. in total 6 <lb/>min/foot. Prior to the examination, the temperature was measured with the internal <lb/>temperature probe on the VibroSense Meter, which is a standard procedure for the <lb/>VibroSense Meter device at each investigated extremity to secure an appropriate interval of <lb/>27°-35° Celsius according to ISO 13091-1 [37,38,39]. The room temperature was between <lb/>20°-22°C (requirement according to ISO 13091-1). <lb/>2) VPT using a hand-held biothesiometer (Bio-Medical Instrument Co, ROVA Company Inc, <lb/>Newbury, OH) was tested according to previously described procedure [17]. The VPTs, using <lb/>the biothesiometer, were measured bilaterally at the medial malleolus and at the distal dorsal <lb/>bony surface of both great toes. The measured unit is decibel (dB). <lb/>Monofilament <lb/>The pressure/touch sensation was examined bilaterally on the sole of the foot with a Semmes-<lb/>Weinstein 10-g monofilament (Gertab AB, Stockholm, Sweden) at three standard sites; i.e. <lb/>the plantar surface of the distal hallux and the 1 st and 5 th metatarsal heads [40]. Pathological <lb/>monofilament test was defined as the absence of sensation at one or more sites on either foot <lb/>[17,41]. <lb/>Thermal testing <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Thermal sensory testings were performed with the method of limits using Thermotest® <lb/>equipment (Somedic AB, Hörby, Sweden) as previously described [17]. The limb temperature <lb/>was kept above 31 °C. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Participant characteristics in the NGT group and the T2DM group were described with <lb/>counts and proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for <lb/>quantitative variables. Chi-square tests and Student&apos;s t-tests were used to test for statistically <lb/>differences in characteristics between the NGT and T2D group. <lb/>All measurements of sensory perception were summarized using means and standard <lb/>deviations. Statistical differences between the left and the right side of the body regarding <lb/>sensory perception were explored by studying standardized differences in means, i.e. t-values <lb/>from paired samples Student´s t-tests. Differences in means between the NGT and T2D group <lb/>were studied using t-values from independent samples Student´s t-tests. Standardized <lb/>differences allow for comparisons of the different methods for studying sensory perception. <lb/>All tests were two-sided and the significance level was set to 5% for all the analyses, i.e. <lb/>approximately a t-value of 2. Spearman&apos;s correlations were calculated between all sensory <lb/>measurements, stratified by NGT and T2D group. The statistical analyses were done using R <lb/>3.4.3 (R Core Team, 2017) [42] and the package &quot;corrplot&quot; [43]. <lb/>Results <lb/>Demographics of participants <lb/></body>

			<body>The characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. Out of the 78 participants in <lb/>the study, 77 completed vibrametry, 78 biothesiometer, 74 electrophysiological assessments <lb/>(amplitude and CV of sural nerve), 78 monofilament test and 73 thermal testing. For the <lb/>VibroSense Meter, there was missing data for the left MT1, 16 Hz and left MT5, 125 Hz in <lb/>one (though not the same) subject. The mean duration of diabetes was 12.3 years in the <lb/>T2DM group (Table 1). As expected, participants with diabetes had a higher BMI than those <lb/>with normal glucose tolerance as well as higher HbA1c levels. Serum cholesterol was lower <lb/>and serum triglycerides higher among participants with diabetes (Table 1). Monofilament <lb/>testing was pathological in 4 participants with T2DM and in none of those with normal <lb/>glucose tolerance. <lb/>Table 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population.

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>The present study show that vibration perception and temperature thresholds on the sole of the <lb/>foot are different in older people with NGT and long-standing T2DM. Measuring vibration <lb/>perception thresholds at lower frequencies compared to the current standard of 128 Hz both <lb/>provided similar correlations to amplitude of the sural nerve. Evaluating vibration sense on a <lb/>tactile area provided similar correlation to amplitude of the sural nerve, as compared to a non-<lb/>tactile area such as the medial malleolus. <lb/>Peripheral neuropathy is one of many potential multi-factorial complications in T2DM [44]. <lb/>In combination with reduced blood flow, neuropathy in the feet increases the risk of foot <lb/>ulcers, infection, and sometimes even the need for limb amputation [11]. Early detection of <lb/>disturbed sensory perception in T2DM is important, in order to avoid further complications <lb/>[19,20,45]. During the early stages of T2DM, plasticity of the nervous system remains, and <lb/>metabolic corrections have the potential to reverse symptoms [20,46]. In the present study, <lb/>with long follow up of the participants we used a variety of methods to detect neuropathy, <lb/>where vibration sense, detected by two different methods, was evaluated in an age-matched <lb/>sample of individuals with NGT and T2DM. In most previous studies, the Biothesiometer, <lb/>using a single frequency (128 Hz), has been used to detect vibrotactile perception applied at <lb/>non-tactile surfaces [17]. This may seem an odd site of approximating peripheral sensory <lb/>perception as tactile sensation on the sole of the foot or on the glabrous skin in the hand is <lb/>considered to be more relevant for function of the lower extremity and the hand, respectively. <lb/>Along with decreasing balance at higher age, reduced tactile sensation increases the risk of <lb/>falls [10]. This suggests that measuring peripheral sensory perception at a tactile surface may <lb/>be more relevant than measuring at a non-tactile surface area. However, the present study <lb/>indicates measurement of vibration sense with the two techniques at a tactile or non-tactile <lb/>area had a similar correlation to the amplitude of the sural nerve and thus a similar correlation <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>to neuropathy. Measuring vibration perception thresholds at lower frequencies than the <lb/>current standard of 128 Hz provides no clear advantage judging by the correlation to the <lb/>amplitude of the sural nerve in the present study in older people with a long-standing T2DM. <lb/>The current practice of measuring vibration perception on the bony surface of the medial <lb/>malleolus seems to be as fair an approximation to amplitude of the sural nerve as vibration <lb/>perception on the tactile surface of the foot, indicating loss of myelinated nerve fibers. <lb/>Furthermore, temperature thresholds had similar correlations to sural nerve amplitude as <lb/>vibration perception thresholds, indicating involvement to a similar degree of both myelinated <lb/>and non-myelinated nerve fibers. Thus, in older people with long-standing T2DM, large and <lb/>small diameter nerve fibers seem to be affected equally. In contrast, the correlation was <lb/>generally weak between conduction velocity of the sural nerve and both vibration perception <lb/>and thermal thresholds. This is likely due to the fact that demyelination of nerves is less <lb/>apparent than the loss of nerve fibers in early stages of neuropathy[47]. Previous results <lb/>suggest an association between blood glucose level and the severity of peripheral neuropathy, <lb/>measured as amplitude of the sural nerve [18]. Thus, finding and evaluating sensitive methods <lb/>of detecting reduced function of peripheral nerve function in various nerve fibers is an <lb/>important task. As expected, there were differences between participants with NGT and the <lb/>those with T2DM. VPTs in men and women are differently affected by diabetes with a higher <lb/>risk for neuropathy in males with diabetes [48], but in the present study analysis of gender <lb/>differences was not to possible due to the limited number of participants. <lb/>At present, monofilament testing, using the 10 gram monofilament, and vibration perception <lb/>thresholds, measured with 128 Hz tuning fork, are used the everyday clinical setting in <lb/>Sweden [41]. Lack of sensation for monofilament and vibration has high specificity, however, <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>sensitivity is quite low [41,49]. Accordingly, the 10 gram monofilament test indicated very <lb/>few of the pathological values in the present study. <lb/>The strength of the present study was that both people with T2DM and age-and gender-<lb/>matched subjects were examined. This is relevant since vibration perception thresholds are <lb/>age-dependent and appropriate cut-off values for judging between pathological and non-<lb/>pathological values are different across different age categories [31]. Sensory perception in <lb/>the foot was measured with different methods and at different sites on the lower extremities <lb/>and vibration perception thresholds were measured with two different methods. The <lb/>temperature of the foot was carefully measured before the examination, as this influences <lb/>vibrotactile perception. A limitation is that the vibration threshold at each site was only <lb/>measured once with each method in each participant. However, good test-retest reliability has <lb/>been shown for VPT which decreases the need for repeated measurements [50]. Also, it is less <lb/>likely that repeated measurements would influence results and conclusions due to the fair <lb/>number of participants. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Vibration perception and temperature thresholds on the sole of the foot are different in older <lb/>people with NGT and long-standing T2DM. Measuring vibration perception threshold at <lb/>lower frequencies compared to the current standard of 128 Hz, or evaluating vibration sense <lb/>on a tactile area compared to a non-tactile area provided similar correlation to amplitude of <lb/>the sural nerve. Thus, measuring vibration perception thresholds at a tactile surface did not in <lb/>the present study seem to provide any clear advantage over the traditional way of measuring <lb/>vibration perception threshold at 128 Hz on the medial malleolus. In people with neuropathy <lb/></body>
