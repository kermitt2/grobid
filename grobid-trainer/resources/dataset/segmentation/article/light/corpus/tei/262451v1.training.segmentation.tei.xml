			<front>Visual motion detection in sighted animals is essential to guide behavioral actions <lb/>ensuring their survival. In Drosophila, motion direction is first detected by T4/T5 <lb/>neurons. Their axons innervate four lobula plate layers tuned to the four cardinal <lb/>motion directions. How T4/T5 neurons with layer-specific representation of motion-<lb/>direction preferences are specified during development is unknown. We show that <lb/>diffusible Wingless (Wg) between adjacent neuroepithelia induces its own expression to <lb/>form secondary signaling centers. These activate decapentaplegic (dpp) in apposing <lb/>tertiary domains dedicated to producing layer 3/4-specific T4/T5 neurons. In the <lb/>absence of Dpp signaling, T4/T5 neurons adopt the default layer 1/2 fate. Dpp signaling <lb/>induces the expression of the T-box transcription factor Optomotor-blind (Omb), <lb/>serving as a relay to postmitotic neurons. Omb-mediated repression of Dachshund <lb/>transforms layer 1/2-into layer 3/4-specific neurons. Hence, spatio-temporal relay <lb/>mechanisms, bridging the distances between neuroepithelial domains and their <lb/>postmitotic progeny, implement T4/T5 neuron layer-specificity. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Visual signals received by the retina are generally not stationary because objects in the <lb/>environment and/or the bodies of animals move. To detect motion, visual circuits perform <lb/>complex spatio-temporal comparisons that convert luminance changes initially collected by <lb/>photoreceptors into signals containing information about direction or speed. Despite the <lb/>seemingly divergent anatomy of visual systems in vertebrates and insects, they display <lb/>remarkable parallels in the computations underlying motion vision and the neuronal elements <lb/>performing them 1,2 . In most sighted animals, this involves neurons that respond to motion <lb/>signals in specific directions. Direction-selectivity emerges from differences in the <lb/>connectivity of their dendrites 2 . Motion-direction preferences by their axons are represented <lb/>by layer-specific innervation 3-8 . Thus, anatomical characteristics such as layer-specificity <lb/>seem to be intricately linked with motion-directionality. However, how these are implemented <lb/>during circuit development is poorly understood. <lb/>The Drosophila visual system has emerged as a powerful model for elucidating the <lb/>neural circuits and computations underlying motion detection. Photoreceptors (R-cells) in the <lb/>retina extend axons into the optic lobe consisting of the lamina, medulla, lobula plate and <lb/>lobula (Fig. 1a). Neuronal projections in these ganglia are organized into retinotopically <lb/>arranged columnar units. The medulla, lobula plate and lobula are additionally subdivided <lb/>into synaptic layers. They are innervated by more than a 100 neuronal subtypes that extract <lb/>distinct visual features, such as motion, in parallel pathways 9 . T4 and T5 lobula plate neurons <lb/>are the first motion direction-sensitive elements in this circuit 6,10 . They represent the most <lb/>numerous subtypes of the optic lobe (~5300 neurons/hemisphere) 11 . While T4 dendrites <lb/>arborize within the medulla layer 10, T5 dendrites are found in the lobula layer Lo1. T4/T5 <lb/>axons project to one of four synaptic lobula plate layers, thereby defining four different <lb/>neuron subtypes each 12 (Fig. 1a). Axonal projections segregate according to their motion-<lb/></body>

			<body>direction preferences. Thus, front-to-back, back-to-front, upward and downward cardinal <lb/>motion directions are represented by adjacent lobula plate layers 1-4 5,6 . T4 neurons are part of <lb/>the ON motion detection pathway reporting brightness increments, while T5 neurons are part <lb/>of the OFF pathway reporting brightness decrements 6 . Distinct sets of neurons in the lamina <lb/>and medulla relay ON and OFF information to T4 and T5 neurons 2,6,13 . Direction-selectivity <lb/>emerges within T4/T5 dendrites and involves the non-linear integration of input from these <lb/>upstream neurons for enhancement in the preferred direction and suppression in the null-<lb/>direction 10,14-16 . Dendritic arbors of the four T4 neuron subtypes have characteristic <lb/>orientations, that correlate with the direction preference of lobula plate layers innervated by <lb/>their axons 16-19 . Thus, direction-selectivity involves the establishment of neuron subtypes, <lb/>each with distinct spatial connectivities. Here, we address when and how layer-specificity of <lb/>T4 and T5 neuron subtypes is determined during development. <lb/>Optic lobe neurons originate from two horseshoe-shaped neuroepithelia, called the <lb/>outer and inner proliferation centers (OPC and IPC; Fig. 1b) 20,21 . Both neuroepithelia are <lb/>derived from the embryonic optic lobe placode 22 and expand by symmetric cell divisions <lb/>during early larval development 23,24 . At the late 2 nd instar larval stage, neurogenesis <lb/>commences first in the OPC, followed by the IPC 21 . Laterally, the OPC gives rise to lamina <lb/>neurons. Neuroepithelial (NE) cells from the medial edge of the OPC transform in a wave of <lb/>neurogenesis into medulla neural stem cells, called neuroblasts (Nbs), which undergo <lb/>asymmetric divisions to self-renew and produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs). These in turn <lb/>divide to generate two neurons or glia 23,25 . Furthermore, apposing the OPC, two dorsal and <lb/>ventral NE domains, called the glial precursor cell (GPC) areas, produce specific neuron <lb/>subtypes associated with all ganglia 26,27 . <lb/>The IPC gives rise to lobula and lobula plate neurons, including T4/T5 neurons. Our <lb/>recent studies showed that NE cells in one domain, called the proximal (p-) IPC, convert into <lb/></body>

			<body>progenitors in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process 24,28 . Progenitors <lb/>migrate to a second proliferative zone, the distal (d-) IPC, where they mature into Nbs. These <lb/>transition through two competence windows to first produce C&amp;T neurons, corresponding to <lb/>C2 and C3 ascending neurons connecting the medulla and the lamina, as well as T2/T2a and <lb/>T3 neurons connecting the medulla and the lobula, followed by the formation of T4/T5 lobula <lb/>plate neurons (Fig. 1a,b). Cross-regulatory interactions between Dichaete (D) and Tailless <lb/>(Tll) control the switch in Nb competence defined by the sequential expression of the <lb/>proneural bHLH transcription factors Asense (Ase) and Atonal (Ato). The latter is co-<lb/>expressed with the retinal determination protein Dachshund (Dac). However, the molecular <lb/>mechanisms that control layer-specific T4/T5 neuron subtype identities within this sequence <lb/>of developmental events occurring at different locations have remained elusive. <lb/>T4/T5 neuron diversity could be achieved by postmitotic combinatorial transcription <lb/>factor codes upstream of guidance molecules. The positions of cell bodies in the cortex and <lb/>neurites in the neuropil within the developing lobula plate indicated that T4/T5 neurons <lb/>employ a birth-order dependent mechanism for retinotopic map formation 21,24 . Thus, layer-<lb/>specificities of T4/T5 neurons could also be determined by temporal differences in a common <lb/>postmitotic differentiation program, similar to the birth-order dependent R-cell growth cone <lb/>segregation strategy described in the medulla 29,30 . Here, we provide evidence for another <lb/>mechanism, whereby layer-specificity of T4/T5 neurons is determined early in the p-IPC <lb/>neuroepithelium. Their specification depends on two relay mechanisms involving Wnt and <lb/>Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling and transcription factor interactions. These <lb/>establish and translate spatial patterning of NE cells into postmitotic neuronal subtype <lb/>identities to bridge distances created by this particular mode of neurogenesis. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>Formation of T4/T5 neurons for lobula plate layers 3/4 depends on Wg secretion <lb/>Wnt family members are evolutionary conserved signaling proteins that orchestrate the <lb/>patterning and growth of tissues during development. Recent findings showed that flies <lb/>expressing membrane-tethered instead of normally secreted Wingless (Wg) were viable and <lb/>had remarkably normal bodies and well-patterned, albeit slightly smaller wings 31 . This <lb/>indicated that the long-range spreading of Wg is not essential for the development of many <lb/>tissues. As the general fitness of these flies was reduced, this study also suggested that Wg <lb/>release could be required in tissues other than imaginal discs. In the visual system, Wg is <lb/>expressed and required in the GPC areas for neuron specification 26,27,32,33 . To explore whether <lb/>Wg could play a role in the IPC and whether the spreading of this signaling molecule is <lb/>essential, we examined brains of adult homozygous flies, engineered to solely express Wg <lb/>fused to the type 2 transmembrane protein Neurotactin 31 (wg{KO;NRT-wg}; Fig. 1c). We <lb/>uncovered a specific and highly penetrant phenotype in the lobula plate (Fig. 1d): unlike in <lb/>controls (Fig. 1e; n=13/13), either one (Fig. 1f; n=18/30) or two (Fig. 1g; n=12/30) of the <lb/>four lobula plate layers were missing. Moreover, T4/T5 neuron numbers were reduced by <lb/>approximately 25% in three-layered and 50% in two-layered samples, respectively (Fig. 1h). <lb/>To determine which layers were affected, optic lobes were immunolabeled with the cell <lb/>surface molecule Connectin, a specific marker of lobula plate layers 3/4. In contrast to <lb/>controls (Fig. 1d,i; n=26/26), Connectin was expressed either only in one (Fig. 1j; n=16/30) <lb/>or none (Fig. 1k; n=14/30) of the lobula plate layers in wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies. These results <lb/>suggest that the T4/T5 neurons innervating layers 3/4 were preferentially affected in flies <lb/>solely expressing membrane-tethered Wg. <lb/>To elucidate the underlying causes of this phenotype, we examined the expression of <lb/>wild-type Wg in the 3 rd instar larval optic lobe. In line with previous reports 27 , Wg protein was <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>detected in the dorsal and ventral GPC areas adjacent to the OPC (Fig. 1l,n,o). Apposing the <lb/>ventral p-IPC, Wg was expressed in surface (s-) IPC NE cells, which give rise to two lobula <lb/>neuron clusters 24 . Additionally, Wg was expressed in a small Nb cluster adjacent to the dorsal <lb/>p-IPC (Fig. 1m-o). We also used the perdurance of wg-Gal4 to mark the progeny of these <lb/>domains (Supplementary Fig. 1a-d). This revealed that wg is not produced in T4/T5 neurons <lb/>or their progenitors in the d-IPC and p-IPC, suggesting a non-autonomous requirement of Wg <lb/>for the development or survival of T4/T5 neurons that innervate layers 3/4. <lb/>Wg secretion from the GPC areas is required to induce wg in the s-IPC <lb/>We next asked how the prevention of Wg release might cause the lobula plate-specific defect. <lb/>In the GPC areas, wg blocks expression of the transcriptional regulator Homothorax (Hth), a <lb/>member of the temporal series in the OPC 33 . We observed that Hth expression was correctly <lb/>suppressed in the GPC of wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies, suggesting that NRT-Wg functions as wild-<lb/>type Wg in this context (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). However, examining the IPC, we noted <lb/>that NRT-Wg expression was absent in the s-IPC (Fig. 2a,b). This NE domain and its <lb/>progeny developed normally, because Hth was expressed and two distinct lobula neuron <lb/>clusters were formed (Supplementary Fig. 2c-f). We considered therefore the possibility that <lb/>Wg originating in the GPC areas could induce Wg expression in the s-IPC. Indeed, Wg <lb/>protein and reporter gene expression were detected in the GPC before the s-IPC at the late 2 nd <lb/>instar larval stage (Fig. 2c,d). Furthermore, wg expression in the s-IPC of wg{KO;NRT-wg} <lb/>flies was lost at the mid 3 rd instar larval stage, when wg normally begins to be expressed in <lb/>these NE cells (Fig. 2e,f). <lb/>Failure of GPC-derived NRT-Wg to induce NRT-Wg expression in the s-IPC could <lb/>conceivably not be due to lack of Wg release but instead to sub-optimal signaling activity of <lb/>the NRT-Wg protein. To address this possibility, we asked whether boosting NRT-Wg <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>expression could overcome observed defects. This was tested by combining a UAS-NRT-wg <lb/>transgene, previously shown to be highly active 34 with the knock-in null allele wg{KO;Gal4}, <lb/>serving also as a driver that restricts activation to endogenous expression domains 31 . UAS-<lb/>FLP and wg{KO;FRT wg + FRT NRT-wg} 31 were introduced to ensure that the endogenous <lb/>locus only produced NRT-Wg following the induction of recombination events. Finally, a <lb/>tub-Gal80 ts transgene was used to control the timing of expression. Thus, at a restrictive <lb/>temperature, Wg expression is normal and no NRT-Wg is produced. After a shift to a <lb/>permissive temperature, UAS-NRT-wg is activated and the wg allele switches to expressing <lb/>NRT-Wg. We found that following a temperature shift at the mid 3 rd instar larval stage, NRT-<lb/>Wg was expressed in both the GPC areas and the s-IPC (Fig. 2g; n=16/16). However, <lb/>following an early temperature shift at the 1 st instar larval stage, no expression could be <lb/>detected in the s-IPC in the majority of samples (76%; n=26/34) (Fig. 2h). We suggest that <lb/>this partial phenotype is due to imperfect allele switching, i.e. residual wild-type Wg <lb/>produced by the GPC, and that Wg release from the GPC is required between the 1 st and mid <lb/>3 rd instar larval stage for induction of Wg expression in the s-IPC. Thus, impaired Wg release <lb/>and not reduced signaling activity accounts for the s-IPC-specific loss of NRT-Wg expression <lb/>in wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies. <lb/>Next, we performed a converse allele switching experiments using wg{KO;FRT NRT-<lb/>wg FRT wg + } to express wild-type Wg in a wg{KO;NRT-wg} background 31 . We used <lb/>R46E01-Gal4 (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h) and UAS-FLP to induce recombination specifically <lb/>in the GPC areas. We observed that expression of wild-type wg in the GPC areas rescued the <lb/>s-IPC-specific loss of NRT-Wg (Fig. 2i,j; n=16/23), demonstrating that Wg release <lb/>specifically from the GPC areas is essential. <lb/>Consistent with Wg signaling-dependent induction of wg expression, Wg signaling <lb/>was activated in the s-IPC, because the Wg target genes frizzled 3 (fz3; Fig. 2k) and notum <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>were expressed (Fig. 2l). Moreover, Wg expression in the s-IPC was abolished following the <lb/>simultaneous knockdown of the Wg receptors frizzled (fz) and frizzled 2 (fz2) (Fig. 2m,n) in <lb/>the IPC by combining the fas3-Gal4 driver 24 (cf. Supplementary Fig. 6l) with UAS-RNA <lb/>interference (RNAi) transgenes. Together, these data show that Wg released from the GPC <lb/>areas is required to induce wg in the s-IPC (Fig. 2o). <lb/>wg in the s-IPC is required to induce dpp in p-IPC subdomains <lb/>How can wg expression in the s-IPC control T4/T5 neurogenesis in the p-IPC/d-IPC? The <lb/>Drosophila Bmp family member Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is a known target of wg in the OPC <lb/>and is expressed adjacent to the GPC areas in dorsal and ventral OPC subdomains 27 (Fig. 3a). <lb/>In the IPC, both genes displayed similar apposing expression domains: wg expression in the s-<lb/>IPC and the small Nb lineage was detected adjacent to dpp-positive ventral and dorsal p-IPC <lb/>subdomains (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, dpp reporter gene expression was maintained in the two <lb/>progenitor streams arising from these subdomains 24 (Fig. 3c,d). Consistent with stepwise <lb/>inductive events, dpp expression in the p-IPC was not found prior to wg expression in the s-<lb/>IPC at the late 2 nd instar larval stage (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, fz3 (Fig. 2k) and notum (Fig. 2l) <lb/>were expressed similarly to dpp in p-IPC subdomains and progenitor streams. In <lb/>wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies, dpp-lacZ in the p-IPC was either absent (Fig. 3h; n=16/32) or showed <lb/>only residual labeling in one progenitor stream (Supplementary Fig. 3a; n=16/32), in line <lb/>with the penetrance and expressivity of phenotypes observed in adults. By contrast, <lb/>expression in the OPC was unaffected, suggesting that releasable Wg is not required in this <lb/>region (Fig. 3g,h). Constitutively-active Wg signaling induced by IPC-specific expression of <lb/>Armadillo S10 resulted in ectopic dpp-lacZ labeling (Fig. 3i; Supplementary Fig. 3b), <lb/>confirming that dpp is a Wg target in the p-IPC. wg is required in the s-IPC, and not the GPC <lb/>areas, because IPC-specific wg knockdown abolished dpp-lacZ labeling (Fig. 3j). Since Dpp <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>signaling mediates EMT of migratory progenitors in the Dpp-expression domains 24 , cell <lb/>streams from these areas failed to form in wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies and following IPC-specific <lb/>knockdown of wg and the Dpp type I receptor thickveins (tkv) (Fig. 3h,j,k). Although the <lb/>overall d-IPC morphology was altered (Supplementary Fig. 3c-f), progenitors and Nbs <lb/>generated from the remainder of the p-IPC showed wild-type cellular marker expression <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 3g-n). In adults, similar to wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies, lobula plate layers <lb/>3/4 were absent following IPC-specific knockdown of fz, fz2 or tkv (Fig. 3l-n). Hence, wg <lb/>from the s-IPC regulates dpp expression in adjacent p-IPC subdomains and EMT of <lb/>progenitors that mature into Nbs producing T4/T5 neurons for layers 3/4 (Fig. 3o). <lb/>T4/T5 neurons for layers 3/4 originate from the Dpp-expression domain <lb/>To provide direct evidence that T4/T5 neurons innervating layers 3/4 specifically originated <lb/>from the Dpp-positive subdomains in the p-IPC, we next conducted lineage-tracing <lb/>experiments. Because dpp-Gal4 is expressed in the entire optic lobe, we searched for a driver <lb/>with activity restricted to the Dpp expression domain of the IPC and identified R45H05-Gal4 <lb/>as a suitable candidate (Fig. 4a). Expression is controlled by an enhancer fragment of <lb/>dorsocross 1, which encodes a T box domain containing transcription factor and a known <lb/>target gene of Dpp 35 . Reporter gene expression was detected in dorsal and ventral p-IPC <lb/>subdomains, cell streams, Nbs and postmitotic progeny in larval optic lobes and persisted <lb/>throughout pupal development into adulthood, where it specifically labeled T4/T5 neurons <lb/>innervating layers 3/4 but not layers 1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b; Fig. 4b). As expression <lb/>was weak, we used the FLPout approach in conjunction with tub-Gal80 ts to permanently label <lb/>R45H05-Gal4 expressing progeny throughout development, and again solely detected T4/T5 <lb/>neurons projecting into layers 3/4 (Fig. 4c). Finally, as an independent confirmation, we used <lb/>the Flybow approach to generate T4/T5 neuron clones labeled in different colors and <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>observed that clones consisted of T4/T5 neurons innervating either layers 1/2 or 3/4 but not <lb/>both (Fig. 4d; n=43 clones in 26 optic lobes). <lb/>In lineage tracing experiments using R45H05-Gal4, clones included C2, the T2-<lb/>variant T2a and/or T3 neurons, as judged by their characteristic cell body positions and their <lb/>terminals in the lamina and lobula, respectively (Fig. 4e). While C3, T2 and T3 neurons were <lb/>not affected (Supplementary Fig. 4d-j), C2 neurons were fully or partially absent in <lb/>wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies with two or three remaining lobula plate layers, respectively (Fig. 4f,g; <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 4c). Due to the lack of specific markers, we were unable to conduct tests <lb/>for T2a neurons. Together these experiments indicate that T4/T5 neurons innervating layers <lb/>3/4, C2 and possibly T2a neurons are specifically derived from the dorsal and ventral Dpp-<lb/>expression domains, while the p-IPC core generates T4/T5 for layers 1/2, as well as C3, T2 <lb/>and T3 neurons (Fig. 4h). <lb/>dac and ato mediate the switch from T2 and T3 to layer 1/2 innervating T4/T5 neurons <lb/>We next asked when and how layer-specific T4/T5 neurons become distinct during <lb/>development. Dac and Ato are expressed in the second Nb competence window of the d-IPC 24 <lb/>(Fig. 5a). We observed that Dac is maintained in all T4/T5 neurons at the 3 rd instar larval <lb/>stage, albeit with varying expression levels (Fig. 5b). However, Dac was only found in ~50% <lb/>of T4/T5 neurons in adults (Fig. 5c; cf. Fig. 7h). The enhancer trap dac p7d23 -Gal4 line <lb/>faithfully reported Dac expression in T4/T5 neurons throughout development (Fig. 5d; <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 5a) and remained active in neurons innervating layers 1/2 (Fig. 5e). <lb/>Thus, Dac is downregulated in layer 3/4 innervating T4/T5 neurons and maintained in <lb/>neurons projecting to layers 1/2 (Fig. 5f). <lb/>To examine the possible role of dac in distinguishing layer 1/2 and 3/4 neuron <lb/>subtypes, we used MARCM to generate dac 1 mutant T4/T5 neurons labeled with the dac <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>enhancer Gal4 line R9B10-Gal4 (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). In adults, some of these dac <lb/>mutant neurons adopted T2/T3 morphologies (cf. Fig. 5f) with neurites extending into <lb/>medulla layer M9 and higher (Fig. 5g,h), as well as synaptic terminals in lobula layers Lo2 <lb/>and Lo3 (Fig. 5i,j). This suggested that mutant neurons adopted features of neurons born in <lb/>the first d-IPC Nb competence window. To assess potential redundancy, we performed dac <lb/>and ato knockdown experiments using validated UAS-RNAi transgenes (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. 5d-g). While dac or ato single knockdown revealed potential roles in the distinction of <lb/>layer 3 from layer 4 neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5h-j), simultaneous knockdown caused <lb/>striking defects. In controls, T4/T5 neurons formed four synaptic layers in the lobula plate <lb/>and Fas3-positive dendrites in medulla layer M10 and lobula layer Lo1 (Fig. 5k,m), <lb/>respectively. In contrast, dac and ato knockdown caused the loss of neurons with T4/T5 <lb/>neuron morphologies and in consequence an undersized lobula plate neuropil (Fig. 5l,n; <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 5k). Remaining neurons innervated the medulla and lobula, consistent <lb/>with T2/T3 neuron morphologies. <lb/>Therefore, dac and ato are required for the transition between Nb competence states in <lb/>the d-IPC and the switch to T4/T5 neuron formation. Layer 1/2 innervating Dac-positive <lb/>T4/T5 neurons could represent a default fate while the subsequent downregulation of Dac is <lb/>required for specifying layer 3/4 innervating T4/T5 neurons. <lb/>Notch controls the choice between T4 and T5 neuron identity <lb/>In the OPC, Notch-dependent asymmetric GMC divisions contribute to the generation of <lb/>neuronal diversity 36 and NE patterning links these binary fate choices to differential apoptosis <lb/>in region-specific lineages 37 . We therefore assessed whether Notch signaling could mediate <lb/>the distinction of layer 1/2 and 3/4 innervating T4/T5 neurons downstream of Dpp. We did <lb/>not detect apoptotic cells in the 3 rd instar larval lobula plate when T4/T5 neurons form and <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>differentiate (Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, genetic manipulations of Notch signaling <lb/>uncovered a role for this pathway in the choice between T4 and T5 fate. Indeed, expression of <lb/>an activated, ligand-independent form of Notch (N intra ) in d-IPC Nbs during the second <lb/>competence window and their progeny using R9B10-Gal4 resulted in the absence of T4 <lb/>neurons, as revealed by the absence of dendrites in the medulla in 3 rd instar larval optic lobes <lb/>(Fig. 6a,b). Conversely, IPC-specific knockdown of the transcriptional regulator Suppressor <lb/>of Hairless (Su(H)) using R17B05-Gal4 caused the loss of T5 neurons in adults, whereas T4 <lb/>neurons were not impaired (Fig. 6c,d; Supplementary Fig. 6f). Adult flies with Notch <lb/>activation exhibited a mild phenotype, in which only the oldest T4 neurons were affected <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 6b-h). In Su(H) knockdown experiments, lobula plate layers 3 and 4 <lb/>could not be discriminated (Supplementary Fig. 6i). This phenotype was associated with <lb/>severe disorganization of the lobula plate and lobula neuropils, likely because of an early <lb/>requirement of Notch in p-IPC NE cells during the 3 rd instar larval stage 28 (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. 6j,k). Hence, Notch controls the choice between T4 and T5 neuron fate (Fig. 6e), but not <lb/>between Dac-positive layer 1/2 innervating and Dac-negative layer 3/4 innervating T4/T5 <lb/>neurons. <lb/>Dpp-dependent specification of T4/T5 neurons for layers 3/4 is mediated by omb <lb/>Our data suggest that the distinction between layer 1/2 and 3/4 innervating T4/T5 neurons is <lb/>controlled by a Notch-independent mechanism. While dpp reporter gene activity extended <lb/>from the p-IPC to the d-IPC, phospho-Mad (pMad) labeling was restricted to p-IPC NE cells <lb/>(Fig. 6f). Consistently, knockdown experiments using Gal4 driver lines with progressively <lb/>restricted activities (Supplementary Fig. 6l-n) revealed a requirement of tkv for layer 3/4 <lb/>neuron formation in p-IPC NE cells (cf. Fig. 3n), but not in d-IPC Nbs and T4/T5 neurons <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 6o-q). <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Therefore, an additional mechanism must relay Dpp activity in p-IPC NE cells to <lb/>distant postmitotic T4/T5 neurons. The T-box transcription factor Optomotor blind (Omb) is a <lb/>target of Dpp in the p-IPC 24 . In 3 rd instar larval brains, Omb expression is maintained in <lb/>progenitors, Nbs and subsets of T4/T5 neurons derived from the Dpp-positive p-IPC <lb/>subdomains (Fig. 6g). Expression persisted in adult T4/T5 neuron subsets (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. 6r). In wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies, omb expression was specifically absent in the p-IPC and <lb/>progeny, but unaffected in the OPC (Fig. 6h,i). <lb/>To determine the function of omb, we conducted knockdown experiments using fas3-<lb/>Gal4 and two validated UAS-RNAi transgenes (Supplementary Fig. 6s-v). Experimental <lb/>animals were raised at 18°C and shifted to 29°C at the early 3 rd instar larval stage, because <lb/>omb is expressed in the embryonic optic lobe placode and null mutations cause severe <lb/>disorganization or complete loss of adult optic lobes 38 . Under these conditions, omb <lb/>knockdown did neither affect dpp expression nor the EMT of progenitors from the p-IPC <lb/>(Fig. 6j,k). However in adults, lobula plate layers 3/4 were absent (Fig. 6l,m). Notably, in <lb/>contrast to tkv knockdown, omb downregulation using Gal4 lines with progressively restricted <lb/>activities revealed that this transcription factor is required in postmitotic T4/T5 neurons for <lb/>layer 3/4 neuron specification (Fig. 6n,o). Thus, omb could relay subdomain-specific Dpp <lb/>signaling effects in p-IPC NE cells across intermediate cellular states, i.e. migratory <lb/>progenitors, Nbs and GMCs, to T4/T5 progeny (Fig. 6p). <lb/>Omb-mediated repression of Dac converts layer 1/2 into layer 3/4 T4/T5 neurons <lb/>Finally, we assessed whether Omb could be the factor responsible for downregulating Dac. At <lb/>the 3 rd instar larval stage, Omb was co-expressed with high levels of Dac in young and low <lb/>levels in older T4/T5 neurons, respectively (Fig. 7a). From 24 h after puparium formation <lb/>(APF) (Fig. 7b) to adulthood (Supplementary Fig. 7a), Omb and Dac showed mutually <lb/></body>

While Dac was maintained in ~50% of adult T4/T5 <lb/>neurons in controls (Fig. 7c,h), 95% of T4/T5 neurons expressed Dac and adopted layer 1/2 <lb/>identity following omb knockdown (Figs. 6o,7d,h). Conversely when omb was over-<lb/>expressed, none of the T4/T5 neurons expressed Dac and all acquired layer 3/4 identity (Fig. <lb/>7e,j). Under both conditions, many T4/T5 neurons underwent apoptosis at the 3 rd instar larval <lb/>stage (Supplementary Fig. 7b-d). Consistently in adults, their numbers were reduced by <lb/>33% and 48%, respectively (Fig. 7h). This suggests that excessive numbers of T4/T5 neurons <lb/>either for layers 1/2 or 3/4 could compete for limited trophic support. To demonstrate that <lb/>omb is indeed sufficient, we took advantage of wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies, in which all T4/T5 <lb/>neurons adopted layer 1/2 identity and Dac was expressed in 97% of these (Fig. 7f,h; <lb/>Supplementary Fig. 7e,f). In this background, omb over-expression only mildly affected <lb/>neuron numbers (19% reduction) and was sufficient to downregulate Dac (Fig. 7g,h). <lb/>Importantly, concomitant upregulation of Connectin suggested that these differentiated into <lb/>layer 3/4 innervating T4/T5 neurons (Fig. 7i,k). Thus, omb is required and sufficient for <lb/>specifying T4/T5 neurons innervating layers 3/4 by downregulating Dac (Fig. 7l). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The spread of Wg is dispensable for patterning of many tissues 31 . However, our studies <lb/>uncovered a highly specific requirement for diffusible Wg in the nervous system, where it <lb/>orchestrates the formation of T4/T5 neurons innervating lobula plate layers 3/4. Their <lb/>generation depends on two inductive mechanisms (Fig. 7m) that are relayed in space and <lb/>time. The spatial relay consists of a multistep signaling cascade across several NE domains: <lb/>Wg from the GPC areas induces wg expression in the s-IPC and likely a small Nb lineage <lb/>adjacent to ventral and dorsal p-IPC subdomains; this secondary Wg source activates dpp <lb/>expression, which in turn mediates EMT of migratory progenitors from these subdomains. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>The p-IPC core produces Dac-positive layer 1/2 specific T4/T5 neurons. By contrast, Dpp <lb/>signaling in p-IPC NE subdomains triggers a temporal relay across intermediate cellular states <lb/>by inducing omb. Omb in turn confers layer 3/4 identity to postmitotic T4/T5 neurons by <lb/>suppressing Dac. <lb/>When Wg is membrane-tethered, the very first step of this cascade is disrupted. <lb/>Several lines of evidence indicate that this defect is not caused by decreased signaling activity <lb/>of the NRT-Wg protein in wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies. First, wild-type Wg signaling activity <lb/>inside the GPC areas and the adjacent OPC was not affected. Second, in allele switching <lb/>experiments, ectopic expression of a highly active UAS-NRT-wg transgene in the GPC areas <lb/>was unable to rescue the s-IPC-specific defect. By contrast, restoring wild-type wg function in <lb/>the GPC areas was sufficient to rescue, supporting the notion that Wg release and spread from <lb/>the GPC areas are required to induce its own expression in the s-IPC. <lb/>Although Wg release is essential, the range of action is likely limited. Wg expression <lb/>in the s-IPC commences at the early 3 rd instar larval stage after Wg expression in the GPC <lb/>areas, when both domains are still in close proximity. Consistently, defects in wg{KO;NRT-<lb/>wg} flies were observed from this early stage onwards. Half of the wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies <lb/>showed residual dpp expression in one progenitor stream and three lobula plate layers in 3 rd <lb/>instar larvae and adults, respectively. While this partial phenotypic penetrance is not fully <lb/>understood, NRT-wg was likely able to partially substitute for wg because of the initial close <lb/>proximity of these NE domains. Theoretically, the dpp expression defect in the p-IPC of <lb/>wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies could reflect the dependence on long-range Wg from the GPC areas. <lb/>However, as we have shown, IPC-specific wg knockdown leads to loss of dpp in the p-IPC, <lb/>demonstrating that expression depends on wg in the adjacent s-IPC. Sequential Wnt signaling <lb/>has been proposed as a mechanism to explain long-range Wnt signaling activities 39,40 . <lb/>Moreover, sequentially acting primary and secondary sources of Wg have been described in <lb/></body>

			<body>the developing Drosophila eye 41 , indicating that the underlying regulatory mechanism <lb/>observed in the optic lobe might be employed in several contexts. The different outcomes <lb/>when inducing wg to NRT-wg allele switching at early and late time points are consistent with <lb/>the idea that Wg secretion is required for the induction but not long-term maintenance of wg <lb/>expression in the s-IPC. In the developing optic lobe, GPC and s-IPC NE cells rapidly <lb/>become separated by compact rows of newly generated neuronal progeny. As part of a relay <lb/>system across several neuroepithelial domains, diffusible Wg may therefore be required to <lb/>bridge distances over a few cell diameters during the initial phase of neurogenesis. Notably, <lb/>the s-IPC in wg{KO;NRT-wg} flies expressed Hth and generated two neuron clusters as in <lb/>wild-type, suggesting that the development and neurogenesis in this domain are independent <lb/>of wg. Thus, the sole function of wg in the s-IPC is to relay the GPC derived Wg signal to <lb/>induce dpp expression in the p-IPC. Based on the observation that Wg release is not required <lb/>in the GPC areas to induce dpp in the adjacent OPC, this secondary wg function in the s-IPC <lb/>is most likely juxtacrine. <lb/>In the OPC, three distinct mechanisms contribute to the generation of neuronal <lb/>diversity: dorso-ventral patterning of NE cells, temporal transcription factor expression in <lb/>Nbs and Notch-dependent asymmetric divisions of GMCs 36,37,42 . Compared to approximately <lb/>80 medulla neuron subtypes derived from the OPC, the specification of thirteen distinct <lb/>subtypes originating from the p-IPC appears simple. However, the mechanisms employed are <lb/>surprisingly complex and distinct. Previously, we found that cross-regulatory interactions <lb/>between D and tll regulate a Nb competence switch in the formation of early-born C2, C3, T2, <lb/>T2a and T3 neurons to the eight distinct layer-specific T4/T5 subtypes 24 . Ato and Dac were <lb/>known to be expressed in the 2 nd Nb competence window and to depend on tll, but their <lb/>precise functions remained elusive. We observed that dac mutant T4/T5 neurons adopted <lb/>early-born T2/T3 neuron morphologies. Similarly, ato mutant T4/T5 neurons develop <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>normally but display neurite connectivity defects 43 . Notably, simultaneous knockdown of dac <lb/>and ato resulted in the absence of T4/T5 neurons, demonstrating that both are required <lb/>together for the ability of d-IPC Nbs to produce a new set of neuron subtypes during the 2 nd <lb/>competence window. <lb/>Dac is initially expressed in all T4/T5 neurons but only maintained in layer 1/2 <lb/>innervating subtypes. Therefore, an essential step for the specification of layer 3/4 innervating <lb/>neurons is the downregulation of Dac and the suppression of the T4/T5 default neuron fate, <lb/>i.e. layer 1/2 identity. Although the mode of this inhibitory mechanism depends on the <lb/>outcome of the Nb-specific switching mechanism in the d-IPC, it is already primed in p-IPC <lb/>NE cells. Thus, layer-specificity and therefore motion-directionality are determined very early <lb/>in the NE precursors of T4/T5 neurons. Molecularly, it involves the Omb-mediated relay of <lb/>Dpp-dependent patterning in NE cells across intermediate cell states to postmitotic T4/T5 <lb/>neurons resulting in the repression of the layer 1/2 neuron-specific determinant Dac. In <lb/>contrast to the OPC 37 , we found no evidence for a link between NE patterning in the p-IPC <lb/>and Notch-dependent differential apoptosis of region-specific T4/T5 subtypes. Instead, Notch <lb/>controls the choice between T4 and T5 neuron fate, likely at the level of GMC divisions, <lb/>indicating that the distinction between layer 1/2 and layer 3/4 neuron fates precedes T4 and <lb/>T5 neuron specification. <lb/>Currently, the mechanisms controlling the maintenance of omb expression, as well as <lb/>Omb-mediated downregulation of Dac are unknown. Hypotheses regarding the latter have to <lb/>be reconciled with the fact that dac, together with ato, is required for the formation of all <lb/>T4/T5 neurons and hence is expressed in all d-IPC Nbs during the 2 nd competence window. <lb/>Omb and Dac are initially co-expressed in Nbs, GMCs and young T4/T5 neurons, suggesting <lb/>that Omb does not directly repress dac transcription. Yet, expression of the dac p7d23 enhancer <lb/>trap Gal4 line showed that dac is only transcribed in layer 1/2 neurons in adults. A possible <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>scenario is that Omb could break Dac autoregulation by triggering degradation of Dac. Since <lb/>T-box genes have been reported to act as activators and repressors of gene transcription 44 and <lb/>their effects can be influenced by various co-factors 45 , elucidating the molecular details of the <lb/>Omb-mediated repression of Dac provides exciting avenues for future studies. <lb/>Consistent with the observation that C2 and C3 neurons have distinct developmental <lb/>origins 46 , we found that Nbs derived from the Dpp-expression domain produce C2 and <lb/>possibly T2a neurons during the first Nb competence window, while the core p-IPC generates <lb/>C3, T2 and T3 neurons. dac mutant T4/T5 neurons adopt T3 and related T2 neuron <lb/>morphologies suggesting that this is the default neuron fate in this group of neurons. While <lb/>Omb is maintained in neurons derived from the Dpp-expression domain, Dac is not <lb/>expressed, suggesting that Omb interacts with other molecular determinants in C&amp;T neurons. <lb/>While we did not explore how layer 1 and 2 neurons or layer 3 and 4 neurons become distinct <lb/>from each other, our data suggest a possible contribution of dac/ato and Notch signaling. <lb/>Furthermore, it will be fascinating to identify the transcriptional targets of Notch, Dac and <lb/>Omb that mediate ganglion-and layer-specific targeting of T4/T5 dendrites and axons, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>Signaling centers, also called organizers, pattern tissues in a non-autonomous <lb/>fashion 47 . The vertebrate roof plate and the cortical hem, for instance, both release Wnts and <lb/>Bmps to pattern NE cells in the developing dorsal spinal cord and in the surrounding <lb/>forebrain, respectively 47-49 . In the Drosophila visual system, the GPC areas were known to <lb/>express wg and to pattern the OPC by inducing dpp expression in adjacent dorsal and ventral <lb/>OPC subdomains 27 . Together with our novel insights into the function of GPC-derived wg on <lb/>IPC patterning and neurogenesis, this firmly establishes the GPC areas as local organizers of <lb/>optic lobe development. At the onset of neurogenesis, wg is first expressed in the GPC areas <lb/>followed by the s-IPC. This observation provides an explanation for the well-established <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>delay in neurogenesis between the IPC and OPC 21 . We propose that Wg release from the GPC <lb/>areas coordinates the timely onset of neurogenesis in the OPC and IPC to safeguard the <lb/>alignment of matching partner neurons across several retinotopically organized neuropils. The <lb/>intercalation of new-born neurons between both neuroepithelia may have driven the need for <lb/>a relay system using primary and secondary sources of Wg in the GPC and IPC NE domains. <lb/>Wg induces Dpp to subdivide the adjacent OPC and p-IPC NE into distinct regions as basis <lb/>for generating neuronal diversity. The temporal relay mediated by Omb represents an efficient <lb/>strategy to pass the memory of spatial NE patterning information by Dpp signaling on to <lb/>postmitotic neurons generated at a distance. It is thus intricately tuned to the distinct <lb/>neurogenesis mode of the p-IPC essential for spatially matching birth-order dependent <lb/>neurogenesis between the OPC and IPC 24 . Interestingly, the progressive refinement of NE <lb/>patterning by the induction of secondary signaling centers plays a central role in vertebrate <lb/>brain development 47 . Furthermore, similar signaling cascades have been recently identified in <lb/>mammalian 3D optic tissue cultures where sequential Wnt and Bmp signaling induces the <lb/>expression of the Omb-related T-box transcription factor Tbx5 to specify dorsal identity of <lb/>retinal NE cells 50 . Hence, such cascades could represent conserved regulatory modules that <lb/>are employed repeatedly during invertebrate and vertebrate nervous system development. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Methods are provided in the extended Methods section below. <lb/>Note: Supplementary Information includes seven figures and two tables. <lb/></body>
