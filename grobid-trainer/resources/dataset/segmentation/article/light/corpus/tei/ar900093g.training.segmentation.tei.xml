Numerous techniques can elucidate <lb/>the structural dynamics of RNA, but computational <lb/>approaches based on experimental data arguably hold the <lb/>promise of providing the most detail. In this Account, we <lb/>highlight areas wherein molecular dynamics (MD) and quan-<lb/>tum mechanical (QM) techniques are applied to RNA, partic-<lb/>ularly in relation to complementary experimental studies. <lb/>We have expanded on atomic-resolution crystal structures of <lb/>RNAs in functionally relevant states by applying explicit sol-<lb/>vent MD simulations to explore their dynamics and conforma-<lb/>tional changes on the submicrosecond time scale. MD relies on <lb/>simplified atomistic, pairwise additive interaction potentials <lb/>(force fields). Because of limited sampling, due to the finite <lb/>accessible simulation time scale and the approximated force <lb/>field, high-quality starting structures are required. <lb/>Despite their imperfection, we find that currently available <lb/>force fields empower MD to provide meaningful and predic-<lb/>tive information on RNA dynamics around a crystallographi-<lb/>cally defined energy minimum. The performance of force fields <lb/>can be estimated by precise QM calculations on small model sys-<lb/>tems. Such calculations agree reasonably well with the Cornell <lb/>et al. AMBER force field, particularly for stacking and hydrogen-<lb/>bonding interactions. A final verification of any force field is accomplished by simulations of complex nucleic acid structures. <lb/>The performance of the Cornell et al. AMBER force field generally corresponds well with and augments experimental <lb/>data, but one notable exception could be the capping loops of double-helical stems. In addition, the performance of pair-<lb/>wise additive force fields is obviously unsatisfactory for inclusion of divalent cations, because their interactions lead to major <lb/>polarization and charge-transfer effects neglected by the force field. Neglect of polarization also limits, albeit to a lesser extent, <lb/>the description accuracy of other contributions, such as interactions with monovalent ions, conformational flexibility of the <lb/>anionic sugar-phosphate backbone, hydrogen bonding, and solute polarization by solvent. Still, despite limitations, MD sim-<lb/>ulations are a valid tool for analyzing the structural dynamics of existing experimental structures. Careful analysis of MD <lb/>simulations can identify problematic aspects of an experimental RNA structure, unveil structural characteristics masked by <lb/>experimental constraints, reveal functionally significant stochastic fluctuations, evaluate the structural role of base ioniza-<lb/>tion, and predict structurally and potentially functionally important details of the solvent behavior, including the presence <lb/>of tightly bound water molecules. Moreover, combining classical MD simulations with QM calculations in hybrid QM/MM <lb/>approaches helps in the assessment of the plausibility of chemical mechanisms of catalytic RNAs (ribozymes). <lb/>In contrast, the reliable prediction of structure from sequence information is beyond the applicability of MD tools. The <lb/>ultimate utility of computational studies in understanding RNA function thus requires that the results are neither blindly <lb/>accepted nor flatly rejected, but rather considered in the context of all available experimental data, with great care given <lb/>to assessing limitations through the available starting structures, force field approximations, and sampling limitations. The <lb/>examples given in this Account showcase how the judicious use of basic MD simulations has already served as a powerful <lb/>tool to help evaluate the role of structural dynamics in biological function of RNA. <lb/> 40 ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH 40-47 January 2010 Vol. 43, No. 1 <lb/> Published on the Web 09/16/2009 www.pubs.acs.org/acr <lb/>10.1021/ar900093g <lb/>© 2010 American Chemical Society <lb/></front>

			<body>Why Use Computational Techniques on <lb/>RNA? <lb/>The central role of RNA in numerous biological processes <lb/>including translation, 1 protein localization, 2 gene regulation, 3 <lb/>RNA processing, 4 and viral replication 5 calls for a detailed <lb/>understanding of RNA function, structure, and conformational <lb/>dynamics. 6 Accompanying and enhancing our increasing <lb/>appreciation of RNA is the rapidly expanding availability of <lb/>high-resolution structures of RNAs and RNA-protein (RNP) <lb/>complexes. These atomic resolution snapshots provide <lb/>detailed rationalization for existing biochemical data; how-<lb/>ever, biological function depends on the dynamic evolution of <lb/>structures along functional pathways. A complete understand-<lb/>ing of the relevant structural dynamics exhibited by RNA <lb/>requires monitoring time scales from picoseconds to hours <lb/>through the application of a correspondingly broad range of <lb/>techniques (Figure 1), 6 with careful consideration given to the <lb/>scope and limitation of each approach. <lb/>Provided they are judiciously applied, computational meth-<lb/>ods provide insights that are not fully accessible through <lb/>experimental techniques. Reproduction of experimental data <lb/>is desirable for assessing accuracy, but modern in silico <lb/>approaches have matured beyond this modest initial goal. <lb/>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can identify problem-<lb/>atic aspects of experimental structures, 7-10 reveal function-<lb/>ally significant stochastic fluctuations, 11,12 predict the impact <lb/>of base ionization on RNA structure and dynamics, 10,13 and <lb/>characterize solvent behavior. 7,10,14,15 Combining simulations <lb/>with quantum mechanical (QM) calculations in QM/MM <lb/>approaches expands the repertoire of applications to mecha-<lb/>nistic questions concerning the reaction chemistry of catalytic <lb/>RNAs, or ribozymes. 16-20 The primary goal of this Account is <lb/>to highlight areas of applicability of MD and QM techniques <lb/>to RNA and their relation to complementary experimental <lb/>studies. <lb/>What General Scope and Limitations Do <lb/>MD Simulations Have? <lb/>Explicit solvent MD is an atomistic technique dealing with one <lb/>or more primary solute molecules of defined geometry sur-<lb/>rounded by an environment of water and ions that jointly <lb/>undergo 1 to &gt;1000 ns of dynamics simulated at room tem-<lb/>perature. MD provides an unsurpassed level of detail of all <lb/>aspects of the time evolution (with subpicosecond time reso-<lb/>lution) of the three-dimensional structure, including the posi-<lb/>tions of all water molecules and ions. However, MD sim-<lb/>ulations are faced with two significant limitations. First, the <lb/>sampling of conformational space reflects the short time scale <lb/>of MD compared with actual biological processes. This limita-<lb/>tion is slowly being overcome with the continuing emergence <lb/>of more powerful computers and codes. Second, a fundamen-<lb/>tal limitation not waning with faster computers is the approx-<lb/>imate nature of force fields, which are simple analytic <lb/>atomistic functions relating structure with potential ener-<lb/>gy. 21,22 Despite sophisticated parametrization, the force field <lb/>simply consists of sets of harmonic springs for both bond <lb/>lengths and valence angles, supplemented by torsion profiles <lb/>for dihedral angles. 21-24 Atoms are approximated as Lennard-<lb/>Jones spheres with constant point charges localized at the <lb/>atomic centers. 23,25 <lb/>There are two widely used nucleic acid (NA) force fields, <lb/>Cornell et al. 21 and CHARMM27, 22 which share similar func-<lb/>tional form but differ in parametrization. 26 Variants of the Cor-<lb/>nell et al. (AMBER) force field (parm94-99, bsc0) have been <lb/>extensively tested for many folded RNAs and noncanonical <lb/>DNAs. 7-9,12-15,24,27-32 CHARMM27 describes B-DNA well 33 <lb/>but has not yet been systematically tested for either folded <lb/>RNAs or noncanonical DNAs. Both AMBER and CHARMM offer <lb/>high-quality protein force fields for consistent description of <lb/>NA-protein complexes. <lb/>The Cornell et al. parametrizations describe the key elec-<lb/>trostatic terms using atomic charges derived to reproduce the <lb/>electrostatic potential around the NA building blocks. 23 QM <lb/>calculations show that base stacking is the best approximated <lb/>term in NA simulations, 34 followed by base pairing, includ-<lb/>ing non-Watson-Crick interactions utilizing the 2′-OH <lb/>group. 28,35 The description of the flexible backbone is less <lb/>straightforward. 24 In particular, the phosphate group is highly <lb/>polarizable and the many dihedral angles of the backbone <lb/>each possess multiple substates. The backbone description <lb/>would therefore benefit from geometry-dependent electro-<lb/>static and polarization terms. Monovalent ions and solute-<lb/>solvent interactions are thought to be reasonably well <lb/>described, while the description of divalent ions is outside the <lb/>applicability of force fields. Ions are simplified as Lennard-<lb/>Jones spheres with constant point charges in their center. In <lb/>reality, the first ligand shell of divalent metal ions is highly <lb/>activated through polarization and charge-transfer so that con-<lb/>stituent water molecules form very strong hydrogen bonds <lb/>that propagate these effects beyond the first ligand shell. 36 All <lb/>these contributions are neglected by the force field. <lb/> FIGURE 1.

			<body>The quality of a force field&apos;s performance inherently relies <lb/>on the mutual compensation of errors, which in turn depends <lb/>on a balance between forces in the system under study and <lb/>the accuracy of the parametrization. There are two basic pos-<lb/>sibilities: (i) The compensation of errors is sufficient, and the <lb/>force field finds the correct global minimum of the simulated <lb/>system. 32 In this case not necessarily all details are correct, but <lb/>the overall description is meaningful. The more qualitative the <lb/>computational task, the more likely the force field descrip-<lb/>tion is sufficient. (ii) The force field does not give the correct <lb/>global minimum and the simulated system eventually <lb/>degrades. 24,37 <lb/>Biomolecular force fields are intentionally parametrized as <lb/>multipurpose, with delicate trade-offs in parametrization. Tre-<lb/>mendously challenging efforts are being expended to develop <lb/>more physically accurate multipurpose polarization force <lb/>fields. 38-43 A major problem in parametrization of these <lb/>sophisticated biomolecular force fields may be to achieve a <lb/>satisfactory overall balance among all their parameters. <lb/>Local conformational traps associated with standard MD <lb/>can be overcome by enhanced sampling techniques (locally <lb/>enhanced sampling, replica exchange, or targeted MD). 27,37 <lb/>Robust sampling is also critical to obtain reliable results from <lb/>free energy calculations that can provide useful information <lb/>on RNA conformations, 17-20,27,44,45 but this goes beyond the <lb/>scope of this Account. <lb/>What General Scope and Limitations Do <lb/>Quantum Mechanical Calculations Have? <lb/>In contrast to force fields, QM can achieve a physically more <lb/>rigorous description of chemical systems. Ab initio QM meth-<lb/>ods are free of empirical parameters and offer a systematic <lb/>(and controllable) tuning of their quality by improving the <lb/>underlying basis sets of atomic orbitals together with a bal-<lb/>anced inclusion of electronic correlation effects. Accurate QM <lb/>calculations are, however, currently limited to ∼30-50 atoms <lb/>and are carried out in the gas phase. 27 QM allows for reli-<lb/>able evaluation of intrinsic (gas-phase) interaction energies, <lb/>defined as differences between the electronic energies of a <lb/>dimer and its component noninteracting monomers. This direct <lb/>structure-energy relationship can be accurately calculated for <lb/>any single geometry of a stacking or base-pairing interaction to <lb/>map the complete potential energy surface. 28,34,35 Such ener-<lb/>gies unambiguously reflect direct forces between the interact-<lb/>ing partners with no influence of the environment, making QM <lb/>a genuine reference tool to parametrize and verify other com-<lb/>putational approaches. 24,28,35 When electron correlation calcu-<lb/>lations are expanded to complete basis sets of atomic orbitals <lb/>and include corrections for higher-level electron correlation <lb/>effects, QM calculations reach similar accuracies for both base <lb/>pairing and stacking and are effectively converged. 34,35 How-<lb/>ever, it is not straightforward to extend QM calculations to bio-<lb/>molecules. NA conformations in particular result from a highly <lb/>variable mixture of mutually compensating interactions, the bal-<lb/>ance of which may vary for distinct architectures. In addition, the <lb/>strong electrostatic forces in NA are substantially modulated by <lb/>solvent screening effects. Accurate inclusion of solvent effects is <lb/>beyond the capability of modern QM approaches. Special care is <lb/>needed when including the NA backbone in QM studies. Iso-<lb/>lated small model systems (even as small as a single nucleotide) <lb/>favor geometries that are biased by gas-phase specific intramo-<lb/>lecular hydrogen bonds, where electrostatic effects of the phos-<lb/>phates dominate the energetics. 46 The problem is not so much <lb/>the quality of the QM methods, but the incompleteness of the <lb/>model system. <lb/>What Practical Considerations Arise during <lb/>Implementation of MD ? <lb/>MD Relies on the Availability of Accurate High-<lb/>Resolution Structures. If a reasonably accurate starting struc-<lb/>ture is available, MD in many cases can locally improve <lb/>molecular interactions and backbone conformations in the <lb/>experimental structure. 47 Due to force field and sampling lim-<lb/>itations MD is unable to predict RNA structures without exper-<lb/>imental input. 48 Additionally, unrealistic models often become <lb/>swiftly distorted during a simulation, revealing their inadequa-<lb/>cies. If the starting structure is in an incorrect conformation <lb/>confined by large (&gt;5 kcal/mol) energy barriers, an MD sim-<lb/>ulation cannot easily move it away from its starting geome-<lb/>try. 29 Reliable characterization of the molecular dynamics of <lb/>an RNA therefore requires the use of high-resolution experi-<lb/>mental starting structures. <lb/>Simulation Performance Needs To Be Judged by <lb/>Comparison with Experimental Data. After collecting <lb/>enough simulations (current state-of-the-art is multiple simu-<lb/>lations with ∼20-50 ns duration each), 29 a careful compari-<lb/>son of the MD time trajectories with the experimental structure <lb/>is needed. A simplified analysis of only a few heteroatom dis-<lb/>tances of interest accompanied by generally uninformative <lb/>root-mean-square distance (rmsd) plots may mask consider-<lb/>able problems. The structural evolution results from a mix-<lb/>ture of factors, including the actual stochastic flexibility of the <lb/>RNA, experimental artifacts introduced through crystal con-<lb/>tacts, 8 disorder or chemical modification, and force field arti-<lb/>facts. If this mixture is properly resolved the analysis of MD <lb/>simulations can be very insightful. <lb/>Evaluation of RNA backbone conformations is difficult for <lb/>both computational and experimental approaches. The flexi-<lb/>bility and polarizability of the backbone is challenging for non-<lb/>polarizable force fields based on constant point charges. <lb/>However, we usually observe surprisingly good agreement <lb/>between experiment and RNA simulations due to compensat-<lb/>ing errors, base-pairing and stacking constraints, and the accu-<lb/>racy of the starting structures. For example, the dihedral <lb/>backbone angles around an S-turn motif in a 2.05 Å resolu-<lb/>tion structure of the hairpin ribozyme with a single-nucleotide <lb/>U39C mutation 49 differ from those of lower resolution (2.65 <lb/>Å) structures carrying wild-type U39. 50 This difference could <lb/>be due to either the distinct crystallography constructs used in <lb/>the two studies or an artifact of the more limited resolution of <lb/>the second structure. MD simulations resolved this ambigu-<lb/>ity. 10 Starting from the lower resolution crystal structure, the <lb/></body>

			<body>backbone dihedrals switched to those observed in the higher <lb/>resolution structure (Figure 2A). Structural bioinformatics using <lb/>a recently developed backbone nomenclature assisted in the <lb/>rapid evaluation of the backbone behavior. 10,51 <lb/>An example of force field problems arises in simulations of <lb/>guanine quadruplex DNA (G-DNA) that consists of four-<lb/>stranded stems formed by cation-stabilized guanine quartets <lb/>complemented by single-stranded hairpin loops. The parm99 <lb/>force field provides a global minimum consistent with the <lb/>experimental structures for the G-DNA stems but not for the <lb/>loops (Figure 2B). 37 Thus, in a given simulation different parts <lb/>of a molecule can be described with different success. Unex-<lb/>pectedly, problems also arose in long (15 to &gt;50 ns) MD sim-<lb/>ulations of B-DNA, due to an accumulation of irreversible, <lb/>experimentally unobserved backbone substates with concom-<lb/>itant progressive degradation of the whole structure. The γ <lb/>backbone torsional profile was subsequently reparametrized <lb/>(parmbsc0). 24 This improved force field allows stable micro-<lb/>second time scale simulations of B-DNA and even repairs par-<lb/>tially degraded B-DNA structures, indicating that B-DNA is now <lb/>the global minimum. 32 The two examples above are the worst <lb/>known problems of the Cornell et al. force fields. For most <lb/>other systems, we do not encounter inaccuracies of this mag-<lb/>nitude. Considering its simplicity, the performance of the <lb/>AMBER Cornell et al. force fields for RNA so far has been <lb/>remarkable. It is nevertheless important to note that the force <lb/>field is still, even after recent adjustment, 24 not satisfactory for <lb/>G-DNA loops. Similarly, replica exchange MD (REMD) reported <lb/>basic folding of an RNA stem-loop; however, the functional <lb/>tetraloop structure was not sampled, likely due to both REMD <lb/>and force field limitations. 52 <lb/>What Are Specific Questions That MD <lb/>simulations of RNA Can Currently Address? <lb/>Resolving Experimental Artifacts. Although simulations <lb/>cannot predict the overall folding of an RNA, they can locally <lb/>resolve regions of limited resolution in known experimental <lb/>structures and reveal structural defects due to crystal pack-<lb/>ing. For example, a local region of lower resolution is <lb/>observed near the conformationally dynamic active site in pre-<lb/>cursor crystal structures of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) <lb/>ribozyme. An unusual set of backbone dihedral angles at the <lb/>active site become more canonical during MD simulations, <lb/>ultimately adopting a common U-turn motif (Figure 3A). 9 Crys-<lb/>tal structures of the HDV ribozyme also show an extruded <lb/>guanine (G76) that participates in crystal packing. 53 Multiple <lb/>simulations reveal the rapid loss of this particular conforma-<lb/>tion and suggest a possible role of G76 in promoting cataly-<lb/>sis through novel hydrogen-bonding interactions with stem <lb/>P1. 8 Similarly, inactivating 2′-deoxy or 2′-O-methyl backbone <lb/>modifications or base mutations used to trap ribozymes in <lb/>their precatalytic structures may distort the active site. Multi-<lb/>ple MD simulations of the hairpin ribozyme consistently result <lb/>in a change in the A-1 sugar pucker in the absence of the <lb/>2′-O-methyl modification present in the experimental struc-<lb/>ture, leading to significant repositioning of the catalytically <lb/>important nucleotides G8 and A38 (Figure 3B). 10 <lb/>Flexibility of RNA Building Blocks. Stochastic flexibility <lb/>is a key functional feature of RNA that is difficult to derive <lb/>from experiment. MD fills the gap by achieving a qualitative, <lb/>atomistic understanding of the stochastic dynamics and flex-<lb/>ibility of RNA building blocks. 11,12 For example, simulations <lb/>have revealed striking intrinsic dynamics of RNA kink-turns, <lb/>FIGURE 2. The good and the bad of MD simulations. (A) Overlay <lb/>of the S-turn from a lower resolution structure (color) with a higher <lb/>resolution structure (gray) before and after MD simulation. The <lb/>backbone trace is highlighted (thick sticks). The dihedral angles of <lb/>the backbone become more like those observed in the higher <lb/>resolution structure. The angle of a δ dihedral is indicated (spheres) <lb/>as an example of a large improvement in angle following MD.

			<body>which can act as anisotropic molecular elbows to facilitate <lb/>functional dynamics of the ribosome (Figure 4). 11 The dynam-<lb/>ics of the helix 42-44 segment of 23S rRNA, part of the <lb/>GTPase associated center, is substantially nonharmonic and is <lb/>not satisfactorily captured by a coarse-grained normal-mode <lb/>analysis. 12 <lb/>Revealing Solvent Dynamics. MD simulations can detect <lb/>long-residency water molecules that occupy prominent hydra-<lb/>tion sites and stay bound for many nanoseconds, contrasting <lb/>with common water binding events of only ∼50-500 ps. <lb/>Long-residency water molecules can serve structural, func-<lb/>tional, and possibly catalytic roles. 7,11,14,54 A structurally rel-<lb/>evant long-residency hydration site was detected in the <lb/>A-minor I tertiary interactions of kink-turns 38 and 42 in 23S <lb/>rRNA. Their A:C base pairs dynamically oscillate between a <lb/>direct and water-mediated hydrogen bond whose intercon-<lb/>version significantly contributes to the elbow-like flexibility of <lb/>the kink-turns. The static X-ray structures show both geome-<lb/>tries, where the A:C interaction of kink-turn 38 is water-me-<lb/>diated and that of kink-turn 42 is direct. 11 Simulations based <lb/>on lower resolution crystal structures of the hairpin ribozyme <lb/>predicted the presence of interdomain long residency water <lb/>molecules that were ultimately verified by the emergence of <lb/>higher resolution structures. 7,55 <lb/>MD simulations can qualitatively characterize major bind-<lb/>ing sites of monovalent ions that are primarily determined by <lb/>electrostatic interactions. Simulations in monovalents alone <lb/>have revealed ion density in known multivalent ion binding <lb/>sites. 7,13-15,29,30,56 For example, simulations of the HDV <lb/>ribozyme predict monovalent cation binding at the cleavage <lb/>site in a crystallographically resolved divalent metal ion bind-<lb/>ing site proximal to the 5′-O leaving group. Two Na + ions and <lb/>their accompanying first hydration spheres fill the catalytic <lb/>pocket and may contribute to catalysis in the absence of <lb/>divalents. 15 This MD prediction was later verified by crystal <lb/>structures solved in the presence of Tl + that reveal two Tl + <lb/>ions at the active site. 53 Simulations further predict a compe-<lb/>tition between ion binding and protonation of C75, 15 a fea-<lb/>ture not evident from the crystal structures but supported by <lb/>mechanistic studies. 57 An additional binding site was predicted <lb/>near the 2′-OH nucleophile. This site is again verified by crys-<lb/>tal structures; however the exact coordination geometry dif-<lb/>fers between experiment and simulation, likely reflecting a <lb/>combination of differences between the ions used, force field <lb/>approximations, and crystallographic ambiguities. 15 Ion bind-<lb/>ing sites may also elude experimental detection, due to either <lb/>low resolution or ion delocalization in the pocket, as observed <lb/>for 5S rRNA loop E and the human immunodeficiency virus <lb/>(HIV) dimerization initiation signal (DIS) kissing com-<lb/>plex. 14,29,56 <lb/>Probing the Structural Effects of Base Substitutions <lb/>and Ionizations. MD can assess the effects of base substitu-<lb/>tions at atomic resolution to complement experimental <lb/>mutagenesis studies. Thus, several base substitutions were <lb/>modeled into the experimentally determined crystal structures <lb/>of the hairpin ribozyme, 7 with good agreement between the <lb/>MD predicted and experimentally determined stability of the <lb/>tertiary structure. 7 The same simulations also revealed <lb/>the importance of coupled networks of hydrogen bonds <lb/>involving long residency water molecules for tertiary struc-<lb/>ture stability, whereby mutations exert significant long-range <lb/>effects. 7 In simulations of the HDV ribozyme, each of the four <lb/>standard nucleobases was separately modeled into the posi-<lb/>tion immediately 5′ of the cleavage site. The wild-type U-1 <lb/>was found to have the most tightly folded catalytic core, con-<lb/>sistent with experimental footprinting data. 9 The same simu-<lb/>lations revealed that a hydrogen bond characteristic of U-turn <lb/>motifs from U1 to the phosphate of C3 is only transiently sam-<lb/>pled (Figure 3A), reflecting a local flexibility at the cleavage <lb/>site that correlates with increased catalytic activity. Simula-<lb/>tions of ribozymes thus reveal additional structural and func-<lb/>tional features that expand on experimental structures. <lb/>MD simulations of the HDV and hairpin ribozymes were <lb/>used to assess the impact of protonation state on catalytically <lb/>relevant structures. In simulations of the HDV ribozyme in <lb/>which C75 is in its neutral (unprotonated) form, a geometry is <lb/>adopted that is suitable for general base catalysis, 13,16 while <lb/>simulations with a protonated C75H + do not predict a reason-<lb/>able geometry for C75 to act as a general acid. 13 (Note that <lb/>this observation may indicate that the crystal structure fails to <lb/>capture the catalytically relevant geometry.) For hairpin <lb/>ribozyme catalysis, compelling mechanistic evidence likewise <lb/>suggests a direct catalytic role for A38. Similar to the HDV <lb/>ribozyme, MD simulations of the hairpin ribozyme with an <lb/>unprotonated A38 lead to a geometry compatible with A38 <lb/>acting as a general base. 10 Such a role is consistent with the <lb/>available biochemical evidence but was previously discounted <lb/>based on heteroatom distances likely influenced by the back-<lb/>bone 2′-O-methyl modification of the cleavage site in crystal <lb/>FIGURE 4.

			<body>structures (Figure 3B). 50,55 Unlike the HDV ribozyme, hairpin <lb/>ribozyme simulations with a protonated A38H + provide a <lb/>geometry suitable for general acid catalysis as well. 10 Obvi-<lb/>ously, assessing a catalytic mechanism is limited in classical <lb/>MD since bond breaking and making are by definition unob-<lb/>servable, thus warranting the use of QM to further evaluate <lb/>the feasibility of a specific mechanism suggested by classical <lb/>MD and biochemical data. <lb/>What Can QM/MM Reveal about the <lb/>Chemical Change Catalyzed by Ribozymes? <lb/>A wide spectrum of both fast and accurate QM approaches has <lb/>recently emerged, allowing for the inclusion of hundreds of <lb/>atoms in a QM calculation. 58 Unfortunately, making a QM sys-<lb/>tem larger but still incomplete will only exacerbate the errors <lb/>resulting from the incompleteness of the system. 46 However, <lb/>fast QM methods facilitate applications of QM/MM hybrid <lb/>methods where a smaller segment of the system is treated <lb/>quantum chemically while the remainder, including the sol-<lb/>vent, is treated classically using force fields. 59 QM is particu-<lb/>larly attractive for ribozymes, since QM, but not MD can <lb/>describe the catalyzed reactions. 60 The main limitations of cur-<lb/>rent QM/MM methods derive from insufficient sampling, inac-<lb/>curacies of the QM or MM method, and treatment of the <lb/>QM/MM boundary. To enhance QM/MM sampling, semiem-<lb/>pirical (such as AM1, SCC-DFTB) and empirical (EVB) methods <lb/>are used. 59,60 <lb/>Calculations using QM/MM methods have predicted spe-<lb/>cific roles for nucleobases, divalent ions, or electrostatic sta-<lb/>bilization in catalyzing self-cleavage by the hammerhead, <lb/>hairpin, and HDV ribozymes. 16-18 QM/MM methods have <lb/>also been successfully applied to the elucidation of the <lb/>mechanism of peptide bond formation and translation ter-<lb/>mination on the ribosome. 20,61 MD simulations of the HDV <lb/>ribozyme provided a suitable starting geometry for a mech-<lb/>anism in which an unprotonated neutral C75 acts as a gen-<lb/>eral base. QM/MM calculations are consistent with a role of <lb/>C75 as the general base and Mg 2+ as the general acid, pre-<lb/>dicting an energy barrier of ∼20 kcal/mol for the catalyzed <lb/>reaction, in good agreement with the available experimen-<lb/>tal data. 16 For the QM scans, a region made up of 80 atoms <lb/>in the active site was treated quantum-mechanically. Mul-<lb/>tiple starting positions of a specifically bound Mg 2+ were <lb/>sampled, establishing a hexacordinated Mg 2+ ion with a sin-<lb/>gle inner-sphere contact to a cleavage site nonbridging oxy-<lb/>gen as the most likely conformation, with the Mg 2+ acting <lb/>as a Lewis acid in the reaction (Figure 5). Mechanisms in <lb/>which C75 acts as the general acid instead, suggested by <lb/>some recent biochemical studies, 62,63 could not be explored <lb/>due to the paucity of suitable starting geometries. In con-<lb/>trast, MD simulations of the hairpin ribozyme with proto-<lb/>nated and unprotonated A38 result in plausible catalytic <lb/>geometries for A38 acting as general acid or general base, <lb/>respectively. 10 These simulations reveal in part the com-<lb/>plex impact of base ionization on the starting ground-state <lb/>geometry and may explain the apparent insensitivity to <lb/>base ionization of an initial QM/MM analysis of the <lb/>ribozyme based on a crystal structure of a transition-state <lb/>analog. 17,18 Large-scale classical simulations may be essen-<lb/>tial in establishing starting geometries for subsequent <lb/>QM/MM calculations. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>MD simulations of RNA are a powerful tool to expand on <lb/>experimental structures and biochemical data, providing <lb/>unique atomistic descriptions of the dynamic roles of nucleo-<lb/>bases, the backbone, counterions, and individual water mol-<lb/>ecules in imparting biological function to RNA. Experiments <lb/>benefit from a side-by-side comparison with simulations, <lb/>where MD can serve to refine, interpret, and better understand <lb/>existing experimental structures. In evaluating MD simulations, <lb/>it is essential to consider that ensemble averaging and error <lb/>margins of the underlying experimental structures have an <lb/>impact and that force field artifacts are pervasive. In some <lb/>instances, the available force field may not be sufficient to <lb/>obtain meaningful results, in which case the limitations should <lb/>be fully acknowledged 37 or even be addressed by improving <lb/>the MD method. 24 QM calculations, often in the form of hybrid <lb/>QM/MM approaches, can further build on MD simulations to <lb/>access reaction chemistry. <lb/></body>
