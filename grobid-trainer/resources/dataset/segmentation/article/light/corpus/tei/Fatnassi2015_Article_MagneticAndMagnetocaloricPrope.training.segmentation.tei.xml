			<body>Introduction <lb/>The modern society is increasingly relying on refrigeration <lb/>technology. The vapor compression refrigerators have been <lb/>mainly used for cooling applications. However, the com-<lb/>pression and expanding processes in the refrigerators of a gas <lb/>are not sufficiently efficient. On the other hand, the use of <lb/>gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydro-chlorofluoro-<lb/>carbons is damaging to our living environment. For these <lb/>reasons, exploring a new type refrigeration technology that is <lb/>environmentally friendly and energy efficient becomes an <lb/>urgent necessity. Comparing to the conventional gas com-<lb/>pression (CGC), magnetic refrigeration (MR) based on the <lb/>magnetocaloric effect (MCE) [1] exhibits several advan-<lb/>tages [2, 3]. Indeed, the MR does not use global warming <lb/>gases and therefore is an environmentally friendly cooling <lb/>technology [4, 5]. So an ongoing research is necessary to find <lb/>appropriate materials with a large enough magnetic entropy <lb/>at moderate magnetic fields near room temperature [5, 6]. <lb/>The gadolinium (Gd) rare earth metal has been considered as <lb/>the most obvious material exhibiting a large MCE in room-<lb/>temperature magnetic refrigerators [2, 7, 8]. However, the <lb/>use of the Gd is limited due to its expensive cost price. <lb/>Nevertheless, some other candidates have been found <lb/>to exhibit large MCE, such as Gd 5 (Si x Ge 1-x ) 4 [9], La <lb/>(Fe 1-x Si x ) 13 [10], MnFeP 1-x As x [11], and Tb 1-x Gd x A l2 [12]. <lb/>In the last few years, manganites with a general formula <lb/>R 1-x A x MnO 3 (R = rare earth, A = alkali earth) have <lb/>attracted more attention as alternative candidates for MR <lb/>near room temperature. Compared to Gd, they show sev-<lb/>eral advantages such as higher chemical stability, higher <lb/></body>

			<body>resistivity, and lower cost. Their preparation can be <lb/>achieved without substantial difficulties. As other advan-<lb/>tages, they present the possibility to tune their magnetic <lb/>transition temperature by the substitution on both R-sites <lb/>and Mn-sites. The MCE of La 1-x A x MnO 3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) <lb/>manganites was first studied by Moreli et al. [13]. A large <lb/>MCE in La 1-x A x MnO 3 polycrystalline samples <lb/>(0.2 B x B 0. 33) is reported by Guo et al. [14, 15]. In fact, <lb/>for DH = 1.5 T, the DS M <lb/>j <lb/>j reaches a maximum of about <lb/>5.5 J/(kg K) at 230 K, 4.7 J/(kg K) at 224 K, and 4.3 J/ <lb/>(kg K) at 260 K for x = 0.2, 0.25, and 0.33, respectively <lb/>[14]. For the same magnetic field of 1.5 T, these values are <lb/>larger than that of Gd, DS M <lb/>j <lb/>j = 4.2 J/(kg K) [2]. As other <lb/>significant information, the magnitude of DS M <lb/>j <lb/>j was found <lb/>to be inversely proportional to the grain size [16]. This <lb/>paper is devoted to seeking for new perovskite manganites <lb/>with broad refrigerant capacity and large MCE demanding <lb/>only low applied magnetic fields close to the room tem-<lb/>perature. Precisely, we report the effect of Fe doping on the <lb/>magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2). They present large <lb/>magnetic entropy change values and high relative cooling <lb/>power (RCP) factors. <lb/>Experimental <lb/>The nano-sized La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, <lb/>0.2) manganites were synthesized using the sol-gel method. <lb/>The starting precursor MnO 2 was mixed in appropriate <lb/>proportion and dissolved in the concentrated nitric acid. <lb/>Suitable amounts of citric acid and ethylene glycol, as a <lb/>coordinate agent, were added. After the addition of the other <lb/>precursors La 2 O 3 , CaCO 3 , and Fe 2 O 3 , a clear black stained <lb/>solution was obtained. Then the solution is allowed to dry to <lb/>form a dried gel, followed by baking at 170°C to obtain black <lb/>precursor powder. Finally, the resulting powder was heated <lb/>in air at 950 °C for 24 h. The X-ray diffraction patterns at <lb/>room temperature were obtained using SIEMENS D8 X-ray <lb/>diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. The FULLPROF pro-<lb/>gram based on the Rietveld method [17] was used for phase <lb/>analysis. The magnetic isotherms were recorded in the <lb/>magnetic field of up to 5 T and at the temperature ranging <lb/>from 4 to 400 K. The magnetocaloric effects (MCE) were <lb/>estimated via the Maxwell relation [2]. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>X-ray diffraction <lb/>Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1) show that the <lb/>samples show single phase and indexed in the <lb/>orthorhombic structure with Pnma group space (Fig. 2). <lb/>Refined cell parameters such as unit cell parameters, unit <lb/>cell volume, R factor, and the goodness-of-fit indicator (v 2 ) <lb/>are listed in Table 1. We can deduce that the substitution of <lb/>Mn 3? by Fe 3? ions induces an increase of the unit cell <lb/>volume. The linear increase is unexpected because we <lb/>substitute Mn 3? having 0.0645 nm as ionic radius by Fe 3? <lb/>with the same ionic radius (0.0645 nm). Consequently, no <lb/>change induced by this substitution is expected. Therefore, <lb/>the increase could be attributed to the lattice disorder <lb/>arising from the random occupancy of Fe and Mn ions on <lb/>the B-site. Indeed, in the pure perovskite La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 <lb/>Fig. 1 Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 <lb/>(x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2) <lb/>Fig. 2 Observed (solid symbols) and calculated (solid lines) X-ray <lb/>diffraction pattern for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 sample.

			<body>system (LCMO), Mn shows a mixed valence with Mn 3? / <lb/>Mn 4? ratio close to 4 ([Mn 4? ] = 0.2 and [Mn 3? ] = 0.8) <lb/>with a valence of ?3 for La. The partial substitution of the <lb/>Mn ions by transition metal ions (Fe) in La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x-<lb/>Fe x O 3 manganites gives rise to changes in the Mn 3? /Mn 4? <lb/>rate, and some Mn 3? -O 2--Mn 4? networks are substituted <lb/>by Fe 3? -O 2--Mn 4? . This causes a disorder of the charge <lb/>transfer mechanism. Such disorder causes a change in the <lb/>Mn-O distances and Mn-O-Mn angles. Consequently, the <lb/>distortion of the ideal perovskite structure in which the <lb/>Mn-O-Mn angle is equal to 180°undergoes a modifica-<lb/>tion. These results are similar to those obtained by Othmani <lb/>et al. [18]. <lb/>Magnetic properties <lb/>To study the effect of substitution of iron in manganese <lb/>sites on the magnetic properties, we have analyzed the <lb/>magnetization variation versus temperature of La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2) samples under an <lb/>applied magnetic field of H = 0.05 T (Fig. 3). The <lb/>M (T) curves reveal that all samples exhibit a ferromag-<lb/>netic (FM)-paramagnetic (PM) transition at Curie <lb/>temperature, T C = 223, 205, 114, and 70 K, for x = 0, <lb/>0.01, 0.15, 0.2, respectively. The Curie temperature T C , <lb/>defined as the peak of dM/dT in the M (T) curves, is <lb/>reported for all compositions in Table 3. This table gives <lb/>evidence that T C and the magnetization are sensitive to Fe <lb/>content. Indeed, the increase in Fe content causes an <lb/>increase in T C accompanied by a reduction of the magne-<lb/>tization. Probably, both changes are attributed to the <lb/>competition between the superexchange (Mn 4? -O-Mn 4? ) <lb/>and double-exchange (Mn 3? -O-Mn 4? ) interactions. The <lb/>Fe takes place at the Mn site as Fe 3? (replacement of some <lb/>Mn 3? -O-Mn 4? bonds by Mn 4? -O-Fe 3? bonds), giving <lb/>rise to an antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Fe <lb/>ions that favors the superexchange mechanism. The evo-<lb/>lution of magnetization (M) versus the applied magnetic <lb/>field (l 0 H) for x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, and 0.2 samples, obtained <lb/>at different temperatures and measured under applied <lb/>magnetic field ranging from 1 to 5 T, is shown in Fig. 4. <lb/>These curves show that, below the Curie temperature, the <lb/>magnetization greatly increases with the magnetic field and <lb/>the saturated M is reached at H = 1 T. For T [ T C , the <lb/>variation of M (T, l 0 H) does not reach the saturation and a <lb/>linear behavior appears. This result confirms that all sam-<lb/>ples present a typical ferromagnetic behavior. <lb/>Figure 5 presents the magnetization measurements per-<lb/>formed at 4 K under applied magnetic fields of up to 6 T, <lb/>for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2) samples. <lb/>Table 2 lists the experimental and the calculated magnetic <lb/>moments per Mn ion, denoted by M Exp <lb/>Sat and M Theo <lb/>Sat , <lb/>respectively. The values of M Theo <lb/>Sat have been calculated by <lb/>considering that the spins of all Mn and Fe ions are aligned. <lb/>The magnetic moment of La 3þ <lb/>0:8 Ca 2þ <lb/>0:2 Mn 1Àx Fe x <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ 3þ <lb/>0:8 Mn 4þ <lb/>0:2 O 3 <lb/>is expressed as <lb/>M Theo <lb/>Sat ¼ 4 Â 0:8 À 0:8 Â x <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ À 5 Â 0:8 Â x <lb/>ð <lb/>Þþ3 Â 0:2 <lb/>ð Þ <lb/>½ <lb/>l B <lb/>¼ 3:8 À 7:2 Â x <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ l B : <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>The magnetic moments of Mn 3? , Mn 4? , and Fe 3? ions <lb/>are l Mn <lb/>3? = 4l B , l Mn <lb/>4? = 3l B , and l Fe <lb/>3? = 5l B , respectively. <lb/>The x is the iron concentration and l B is the Bohr mag-<lb/>neton. We note that the magnetization saturation values <lb/>M Sat decrease with increasing Fe content, especially for <lb/>x = 0.2. It is worth noting that similar results are reported <lb/>in [19].

			<body>samples. Based on the of Banerjee&apos;s criterion, the LCM <lb/>and LCMF 0.01 systems exhibit a first-order ferromagnetic-<lb/>to-paramagnetic phase transition, whereas a second-order <lb/>transition is confirmed for LCMF 0.15 and LCMF 0.2 . <lb/>Magnetocaloric study <lb/>The MCE is defined as the heating or cooling of a magnetic <lb/>material due to the application or suppression of a magnetic <lb/>field, respectively. To estimate the magnetocaloric effect, <lb/>the change of magnetic entropy (DS M ) was calculated <lb/>numerically using the equation [21]: <lb/>ÀD S M <lb/>ð Þ ¼ <lb/>X ðM i À M iþ1 <lb/>T iþ1 À T i <lb/>ÞDH i : <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>The M i and M i?1 are the experimental values of mag-<lb/>netization measured at temperatures T i and T i?1 , respec-<lb/>tively. The H i is the applied magnetic field. The magnetic <lb/>entropy change (DS M ) determined numerically using <lb/>Eq. (2) and the M (T, l 0 H) curves are shown in Fig. 7. The <lb/>(DS M ) value increases with temperature increase to reach a <lb/>maximum near T C and lowers above T c . To compare our <lb/>results with previously published data for other perovskite <lb/>manganites, we listed in Table 3 the data of several mag-<lb/>netic materials that could be used as magnetic refrigerants. <lb/>Also, the maximum magnetic entropy change of Fe-doped <lb/>manganites increases gradually with increasing applied <lb/>magnetic field for such materials. We noted that the max-<lb/>imum entropy change DS max <lb/>M <lb/>corresponding to a magnetic <lb/>field variation of 5 T for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 and La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 0.99 Fe 0.01 O 3 is about 4.42 and 4.32 J/(kg K), <lb/>respectively. <lb/>In Table 3, we compared our performances of MCE <lb/>with those of Gd [2]-based materials as well as rare earth <lb/>manganites. The highest value of the magnetic entropy <lb/>change for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 and La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 0.99 Fe 0.01 O 3 <lb/>samples is observed with x = 0 content and is equal to 1.96 <lb/>and 4.42 J/(kg K) under magnetic fields of 1 and 5 T, <lb/>respectively. In addition, similar results were observed by <lb/>Shaobo Xi et al. for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 [25] and by S. <lb/>Fig. 6 Arrott curves M 2 versus l 0 H/M for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 samples: a x = 0, b x = 0.01, c x = 0.15, and d x = 0.2 <lb/></body>

			<body>Conclusion <lb/>We have studied the structural, magnetic, and magne-<lb/>tocaloric properties of the Fe-doped manganite perovskite <lb/>La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 compounds with 0 B x B 0.2. The <lb/>results show that the samples crystallize in the orthorhombic <lb/>structure with Pnma space group. The magnetic properties <lb/>reveal that all samples exhibit a paramagnetic-ferromag-<lb/>netic transition when temperature decreases. From magne-<lb/>tocaloric study, the LCMO and LCMF 0.01 O samples have a <lb/>large magnetic entropy change. The maximum values of the <lb/>magnetic entropy changes decrease with the increase of Fe <lb/>concentration. In addition, due to the high DS M and RCP <lb/>values, Fe-doped manganite perovskite samples can be <lb/>considered a potential refrigerant for use in near-room-<lb/>temperature magnetic refrigeration. <lb/></body>
