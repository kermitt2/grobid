			<front> CTA telescopes as deep-space <lb/>lasercom ground receivers <lb/> Alberto Carrasco-Casado <lb/> Space Communication Systems Laboratory <lb/>National Institute of Information and Communications Technology <lb/>4-2-1 Nukui-Kitamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8795, Japan <lb/>alberto@nict.go.jp <lb/> José Manuel Sánchez-Pena, Ricardo Vergaz <lb/> Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III University of Madrid <lb/>Av. de la Universidad 30, Madrid 28911, Spain <lb/> Abstract—The amount of scientific data to be transmitted <lb/>from deep-space probes is currently very limited due to RF-<lb/>communications constraints. Free-space optical communication <lb/>promises to alleviate this bottleneck as this technology makes it <lb/>possible to increase the data rate while reducing the weight, mass <lb/>and power of communication onboard equipment. Nevertheless, <lb/>further improvements are needed to optimize the power delivery <lb/>from the spacecraft to the Earth. This has been also a major issue <lb/>in RF communications, where the main strategy has been to <lb/>increase the aperture of ground terminals. Free-space optical <lb/>communications can also be benefited from this strategy, as it <lb/>shares the same limitation with RF, i.e. the low power received on <lb/>the Earth. However, the cost of big telescopes increases <lb/>exponentially with their aperture, being much bigger than the <lb/>cost of big antennas. Therefore, new ideas are required to <lb/>maximize the aperture-to-cost ratio. This work explores the <lb/>feasibility of using telescopes of the future Cherenkov Telescope <lb/>Array as optical-communication ground stations. Cherenkov <lb/>telescopes are used for gamma-ray astronomy, yet they are <lb/>optical telescopes with some special characteristics. Ground-<lb/>based gamma-ray astronomy has the same received-power <lb/>limitation as deep-space lasercom, hence Cherenkov telescopes <lb/>are designed to maximize the receiver&apos;s aperture, reaching up to <lb/>30-m diameters, at a minimum cost with some relaxed <lb/>requirements. Discussions on the critical issues of the <lb/>reutilization, as well as possible adaptations of the telescopes to <lb/>optimize them for communications, are presented. Telescopes <lb/>simulations and numerical computations of several link budgets <lb/>applied to different worst-case scenarios are discussed, <lb/>concluding that the proposal is technically feasible and would <lb/>bring important cost reductions as well as performance <lb/>improvements compared to current designs for deep-space <lb/>optical ground stations. <lb/> Keywords— Free-space optical communication; Deep-space <lb/>communication; Cherenkov telescopes <lb/></front>

			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Payloads in deep-space missions are continually increasing <lb/>the amount of information collected during their lifetimes. The <lb/>result is that bigger and bigger amounts of data need to be <lb/>transmitted back to Earth, and current radiofrequency (RF) <lb/>technology has reached a bottleneck, limiting the scientific <lb/>outcome of current missions and threatening the development <lb/>of future manned missions. To solve this, optical frequencies <lb/>have been studied and applied [1] to increase the bandwidth <lb/>and to reduce the volume, mass and power needs at the same <lb/>time. One of the main advantages of shorter wavelengths is the <lb/>narrow divergence of the laser beams. For example, a <lb/>communication link from Mars would allow a reduction of the <lb/>footprint reaching the Earth from ~1000 in RF to ~0.1 of the <lb/>Earth diameter using optical wavelengths. <lb/>A natural need of a Free-Space Optical Communication <lb/>(FSOC) link, especially from deep-space, is the use of a ground <lb/>terminal, i.e., a telescope, with a big aperture to overcome the <lb/>very low power received. Nevertheless, unlike conventional <lb/>astronomical telescopes, in FSOC there is no need to obtain <lb/>images, thus the requirements are not so strong in terms of <lb/>optical quality. This is one of the reasons to study the use of <lb/>other kind of telescopes. This paper completes an initial <lb/>proposal from the authors about the use of IACTs (Imaging <lb/>Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes) as optical ground <lb/>terminals in deep-space FSOC [2]. <lb/>II. PROBLEM AND SOLUTION PROCEDURE <lb/>Cherenkov radiation is produced in the atmosphere when a <lb/>cosmic ray or a gamma ray interacts with the molecules of the <lb/>atmospheric upper layers. As a result, visible photons are <lb/>produced, and IACTs are designed to detect them in the ground <lb/>using a big reflective surface. These telescopes observe the <lb/>atmosphere at a height of ~10 km, where on average the <lb/>Cherenkov radiation is produced. The Cherenkov Telescope <lb/>Array (CTA) is a 200 M€ international collaboration involving <lb/>31 countries to build over a hundred of big segmented <lb/>telescopes (fig. 1) in the next years, deployed in two <lb/> Fig. 1. Artistic illustration of the Cherenkov Telescope Array [3]. <lb/> Fig. 2. Diagram of the three types of different <lb/>CTA telescopes [3]. <lb/> observatories, one in each Earth&apos;s hemisphere to allow full <lb/>coverage of the sky [3]. Recently, the CTA Resource Board <lb/>decided to host CTA-South in the ESO Paranal grounds <lb/>(Chile), and CTA-North in Roque de los Muchachos <lb/>Observatory (La Palma, Spain) [4]. Several telescope <lb/>prototypes have already been tested and the final telescopes <lb/>will be built in the next few years with the goal of being fully <lb/>operational in 2020. <lb/>The <lb/>CTA <lb/>observatory <lb/>will <lb/>consist of about 100 <lb/>telescopes on the <lb/>southern site and <lb/>about 20 telescopes <lb/>on the northern site. <lb/>In each observatory, <lb/>there will be three <lb/>types of different <lb/>telescopes (fig. 2): <lb/> • SST (Small Size Telescopes): with 6-m diameter and <lb/>10º field of view (FoV). A pool of dozens of them, <lb/>separated by at least 70 m, is projected, thus a massive <lb/>production will be carried out. <lb/> • MST (Medium Size Telescopes): with 12-m diameter <lb/>and 6º to 8º FoV. Tens of them with 100-m spacing are <lb/>foreseen, being the most similar to current IACTs. <lb/> • LST (Large Size Telescopes): with 24-m diameter and <lb/>4º to 5º FoV, 100-m spacing and around 4 units in each <lb/>observatory. The first prototype of this kind is <lb/>currently under construction in La Palma, Spain. <lb/>The authors of this paper presented the original idea of <lb/>using IACT telescopes for deep-space FSOC in a previous <lb/>paper [2]. The motivations were explored back then: the big <lb/>apertures of the telescopes, their native operation as an array, <lb/>their low costs due to their relaxed requirements, the ideal <lb/>sky-related conditions, the fast tracking of the telescopes, a <lb/>suitable communications network infrastructure, etc. Now, the <lb/>proposal is studied in more depth and extended to CTA <lb/>telescopes. Data on the telescope designs has been taken from <lb/>those planned under current CTA consideration. <lb/>In the next sections, a deep insight into the main differences <lb/>of gamma-ray and communication telescopes will be carried <lb/>out, focusing on the telescopes from the CTA project. <lb/>Originally, this proposal is aimed to the direct reutilization of <lb/>one or more CTA telescopes for their exclusive use as <lb/>communication receivers. However, a different approach could <lb/>also be taken into consideration, i.e. the shared operation for <lb/>astronomy and communications. The direct reutilization of <lb/>CTA telescopes, with minor modifications, is proposed, <lb/>although a brief discussion on possible improvements to <lb/>optimize their performance for FSOC will be made. <lb/>In this study, reflectance/transmittance measurements were <lb/>performed using a Lambda 900 spectrometer by Perkin Elmer. <lb/>OSLO (Optics Software for Layout and Optimization) software <lb/>from Lambda Research was used for the optical models and <lb/>simulations, allowing the computation of optical performance <lb/>of the telescopes. MODTRAN (MODerate resolution <lb/>atmospheric TRANsmission) software from Spectral Sciences <lb/>was used as the standard tool to retrieve atmospheric <lb/>transmission and sky radiance, in order to compute received <lb/>noise in simulations at different scenarios. Matlab from <lb/>MathWorks was used for the rest of computations. Lastly, the <lb/>recommendations from Optical Link Study Group (OLSG), a <lb/>subcommittee of the Interagency Operations Advisory Group <lb/>(IOAG), co-chaired by ESA and NASA and in charge of the <lb/>international standardization of FSOC, were followed in the <lb/>simulations. <lb/>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>In order to fulfill the requirements of FSOC, some IACTs <lb/>items must be carefully studied. The reflectivity of the mirrors <lb/>at the desired wavelength, the different position of the image <lb/>plane and the focal plane, the pointing and tracking of the <lb/>telescope gimbal, and a brief discussion of the optimization of <lb/>the detector size were already made in [2]. Hereafter, updates <lb/>on the reflectivity and focusing with new CTA solutions as <lb/>well as FoV limitations for the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in <lb/>this kind of telescopes will be explored. After that, a number of <lb/>telescope simulations will be performed to validate their proper <lb/>operation for FSOC. With these results, a summary of the link <lb/>budgets that can be achieved for different scenarios will be <lb/>made, concluding with a brief analysis of the costs. <lb/> A. Mirrors of CTA telescopes <lb/> The first item to be explored is the performance of the <lb/>mirrors at FSOC wavelength. Several techniques are being <lb/>proposed for manufacturing CTA segments of primary mirrors. <lb/>Due to the foreseen massive production, the spherical mirror <lb/>profiles and the moderate optical quality required, most <lb/>techniques are based on replica to minimize costs <lb/>(~2000 €/m 2 ), where glass is conformed using a molding based <lb/>on a honeycomb structure [5], but the curvature radius that this <lb/>technique can achieve is too low for most SST and probably so <lb/>for MST as well. Thus, more traditional polishing techniques <lb/>with diamond in aluminum (~2500 €/m 2 ) will be also <lb/>examined. Finally, to avoid degradation in aluminum layers <lb/>and increase reflectivity, interference dielectric multilayer <lb/>designs are also under study [6]. In these mirrors, the <lb/>reflectivity can be adjusted in narrow spectral bands. The main <lb/>question to be solved is whether the mirrors can be directly <lb/>used in FSOC wavelength (1550 nm), provided that they are <lb/>designed for Cherenkov radiation band (visible light). <lb/> Fig. 3. Measured reflectance of the mirrors types considered for CTA. <lb/> Reflectance measurements have been carried out over <lb/>different mirrors currently intended to be used in CTA [2]. <lb/>These measurements showed that the reflectance at FSOC <lb/>wavelengths is even higher than in the Cherenkov region for <lb/>current IACT mirrors, reaching over 90% at 1550 nm. Fig. 3 <lb/>shows the measured reflectance of several replica-based <lb/>samples supplied by the CTA consortium: AR100 is made up <lb/>of an aluminum layer and a quartz coating (Al+SiO2), DH100 <lb/>is based on an aluminum layer with dielectric multilayer <lb/>coating (SiO2+HfO2+SiO2), and DD040 is a pure dielectric <lb/>multilayer mirror. AR100 reaches 94.9% at 1550 nm (around <lb/>85% for Cherenkov range), and DH100 reaches 93.0% (88.8% <lb/>at Cherenkov range). The remarkable interference effect of <lb/>DD040 reaches a 98.8% at Cherenkov wavelengths, although a <lb/>poor 7.3% at 1550 nm. In principle, this could be a problem, <lb/>since this technique is only starting to be spread. However, <lb/>pure dielectric mirrors can be tuned to maximize their <lb/>reflectance in a different wavelength during the manufacture <lb/>process with no additional cost [7]. Furthermore, mirrors of this <lb/>kind were installed in Hess telescope (28-m IACT located in <lb/>Namibia) in 2012 showing a nearly 100% reflectance at <lb/>1550 nm, although for reasons not related to communications. <lb/> B. Focusing an IACT <lb/> In [2], the required detector position displacement ε in <lb/>order to focus at infinity (as a FSOC receiver) instead of at a <lb/>point 10 km high in the atmosphere (as IACTs are designed to <lb/>operate, in order to detect the Cherenkov radiation), was <lb/>studied for the MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging <lb/>Cherenkov Telescope) telescope. The same equations of [2], <lb/>applied to CTA, give ε values ranging from 1.4 cm (SST) to 9 <lb/>cm (LST) (see table I). In the case of MAGIC II, the camera <lb/>can be shifted as far as 30 cm in real operations for focusing <lb/>and maintenance [8], so this is a normal feature in IACTs. <lb/>Furthermore, when adapting an IACT as a FSOC receiver, the <lb/>big and heavy cameras should be replaced by a simpler system <lb/>based on a single photodetector, leaving enough space to <lb/>allocate any optical setup with no significant constraints. <lb/> C. Field of View and Background Noise <lb/> In [2], a discussion about the relation between the FoV and <lb/>the SNR was made for MAGIC-II telescope. A deeper <lb/>discussion needs to be made regarding the concepts of SNR, <lb/>FoV and their relation with the optical resolution of the CTA <lb/>telescopes. The optical resolution is characterized by the Point <lb/>Spread Function (PSF), which determines the spatial <lb/>distribution of the radiation received from a point source at <lb/>infinity, i.e., the radiation coming from a space probe received <lb/>at the focal plane of the telescope. The FoV θFOV is the angular <lb/>spread in the object plane projected on the image plane of the <lb/>telescope. It is also a function of the detector size (in this work, <lb/>a circular shape is assumed), given by eq. (1). <lb/> θFOV = 2arctan(d/2f) <lb/> (1) <lb/> d being the diameter of the detector, and f the focal length of <lb/>the telescope. The multi-pixel camera (made up by up to 2500 <lb/>photomultiplier tubes in the case of LST) designed for CTA <lb/>telescopes should be replaced by a simpler system based on a <lb/>single photodetector, with an important reduction in the <lb/>detector size, and therefore in the FOV. <lb/>Cherenkov telescopes operate during dark nights only. <lb/>However, FSOC telescopes must support also daylight <lb/>operation. In this case, the sunlight, which is the main source of <lb/>background radiation due to the scattering caused by <lb/>atmospheric gases (Rayleigh) and particles (Mie), reaches the <lb/>detector as a noisy signal, hence with a decrease in the SNR. In <lb/>this work, a worst case for each link scenario will be studied, <lb/>and this spurious light will lead to a detected noise power N S. <lb/> According to eq. (2), this power depends on the sky radiance <lb/> L(λ,θ,ϕ) (which in turn depends on wavelength λ, zenith angle <lb/> θ, and the angle ϕ between the telescope, the target and the <lb/>Sun), the receiver&apos;s aperture area Ar, the two-dimensional FoV <lb/>angle ΩFOV, and the spectral bandwidth of the signal ∆λ. <lb/> NS = L(λ,θ,φ)·Ar·ΩFOV·Δλ <lb/> (2) <lb/> In terms of two-dimensional space (one-dimensional <lb/>angle), eq. (2) can be translated to eq. (3), with Dr being the <lb/>aperture diameter of the telescope. <lb/> NS = L(λ,θ,φ)·(π/4·Dr· θFOV)  2  ·Δλ <lb/> (3) <lb/> The parameter that allows more control in this kind of link <lb/>design (using an already-built telescope) is the detector area d, <lb/> which has a strong relation with the optical resolution of the <lb/>telescope. If d is bigger than the PSF, then too much noise will <lb/>reach the detector, decaying the SNR. If d is smaller than the <lb/>PSF, then many signal photons will be lost, which must be <lb/>avoided in links as strongly limited by the received signal <lb/>power as deep-space ones. Therefore, the detector size d will <lb/>determine the performance of the link, and ideally it should <lb/>match the size of the PSF, which in turn should be as small as <lb/>possible to minimize the FoV, thus the background noise, <lb/>maximizing the SNR. <lb/>In IACTs, the PSF is mainly limited by telescope <lb/>aberrations, which prevail over turbulence and diffraction <lb/>effects. The PSF of MAGIC II was simulated by the authors to <lb/>have a diameter of 31.7 mm [2], which agrees well with <lb/>experimental measurements [9]. As this IACT has an aperture <lb/>diameter of 17 m, its diffraction limit is in the order of tens of <lb/>nm, five orders of magnitude below that value. The PSF <lb/>affected by turbulence has been computed to be around <lb/>7.5 µrad for the worst case of 70º zenith angle at 1550 nm, over <lb/>3 orders of magnitude below the PSF. The MAGIC FoV for a <lb/>single pixel is around 2 mrad, two orders of magnitude over <lb/> TABLE I. DETECTOR DISPLACEMENT  ε  IN IACTS FOR FSOC OPERATION. <lb/> Telescope <lb/> Diameter <lb/>D (m) <lb/>f/D <lb/>Focal length <lb/>f (m) <lb/> ε (cm) <lb/> MAGIC <lb/>17 <lb/>1 <lb/>17 <lb/>2.9 <lb/>CTA-SST <lb/>6 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>12 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>CTA-MST <lb/>12 <lb/>1 / 0.75 <lb/>16 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>CTA-LST <lb/>24 <lb/>1.25 <lb/>30 <lb/> 9 <lb/> usual values in FSOC receiver. CTA telescopes need to be <lb/>characterized with their optical resolution to quantify this <lb/>limitation when applied to a communication link, as well as to <lb/>analyze possible PSF improvements to optimize their operation <lb/>to FSOC. Next section will be devoted to this characterization. <lb/> D. CTA telescopes simulations <lb/> Telescopes with lower focal ratios (f/D) have stronger <lb/>geometrical aberrations [10], which is the case for CTA <lb/>telescopes. Furthermore, the use of spherical optics to reduce <lb/>costs in the mirror manufacture, worsen the aberration <lb/>behavior. For these reasons, ray-tracing simulations of CTA <lb/>telescopes have been carried out to obtain their performance in <lb/>terms of optical resolution. IACTs are designed to have a wide <lb/>FoV, as they need to observe wide sections of the sky. <lb/>Conversely, in FSOC, once the telescope is pointed towards the <lb/>spacecraft, the radiation of interest will be received only in <lb/>axis, hence FoV can be greatly reduced to maximize the SNR. <lb/>CTA telescopes have been simulated in OSLO (see <lb/>example of fig. 4) modelling their respective geometries and <lb/>hexagonal spherical segments, each with its curvature radius <lb/>according to its position in the primary mirror profile. In this <lb/>study, aperture profiles are taken as they were designed for <lb/>CTA: LST parabolic [11], MST [12] and SST [13] <lb/>Davies-Cotton (MST-DC and SST-DC) [14], and MST and <lb/>SST Schwarzschild-Couder (MST-SC and SST-SC) [15]. The <lb/>latter one has two variations: the British-French GATE <lb/>(GAmma-ray Telescope Elements): SST-SC GATE [16-17]; <lb/>and the Italian ASTRI (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia <lb/>Replicante Italiana): SST-SC ASTRI [18-19]. <lb/>As a first step, after computing the OSLO simulation <lb/>assuming ideal mirrors, the following spot diagram radii were <lb/>obtained for the segments of each telescope: 57.3 µm for SST-<lb/>DC, 25.7 µm for MST-DC and 16.4 µm for LST (close to their <lb/>diffraction limits, being 11.9 µm, 22 µm and 30.9 µm, <lb/>respectively). Then, the final profiles were created by <lb/>assembling all the segments according to the shape of each <lb/>telescope. For each mirror (e.g. LST is made up by 198 <lb/>different segments), it is necessary to compute its 3D position, <lb/>its curvature radii and its tip/tilt angles: the 3D position of each <lb/>mirror can be calculated according to each telescope profile, <lb/>indicated in the previous paragraph; the curvature radii are <lb/>calculated as an average value of the maximum and minimum <lb/>values of the telescope profile in each segment; and as for the <lb/>tip/tilt angles, initial values were calculated as a first approach <lb/>using simple trigonometry. <lb/>The obtained spot diagrams were asymmetrical and needed <lb/>to be optimized (fig. 5(a)). An iterative method for all the <lb/>tip/tilt angles was applied to get an optimized and symmetrical <lb/>spot diagram (fig. 5(b)). A damped least-squares method <lb/>applied to an error function defined by the diameter of the PSF <lb/>was applied in OSLO using its optimization capabilities. This <lb/>is as realistic as using the actual tip/tilt actuators currently used <lb/>in each IACTs to locally correct the alignment of each <lb/>segment. The movements needed to perform this optimization <lb/>were all below the actual capabilities of the Active Mirror <lb/>Control (AMC) systems projected for CTA telescopes. <lb/>When using real mirrors, the wavefront will be distorted <lb/>beyond the ideal behavior. The performed OSLO models also <lb/>took this effect into account simulating realistic prototypes of <lb/>CTA mirrors from Japanese Sanko and Italian ASTRI [11, 21]. <lb/>A series of random surface profiles were generated and <lb/>superimposed over each ideal mirror to simulate this behavior <lb/>(see the realistic model in fig. 6(b), compared to the ideal <lb/>model in fig. 6(a)). Following similar statistical parameters as <lb/>the experimental measurements from real samples, a different <lb/>random surface was generated for each mirror. After this, more <lb/>realistic spot diagrams were obtained. <lb/>The PSF size obtained with these OSLO simulations were <lb/>as follows: 6.20 cm for LST, 3.42 cm for MST-DC, and 3.43 <lb/>cm for SST-DC. Using their respective focal lengths, the FoV <lb/>can be calculated as 2.24, 2.19 and 6.13 mrad, respectively for <lb/>LST, MST-DC and SST-DC. For the SC configurations of <lb/>MST and SST telescopes, not enough information was <lb/>available to perform the OSLO simulations, therefore nominal <lb/> (a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>Fig. 6.

(a) Spot diagram for non-optimized LST using ideal mirrors. (b) Spot <lb/>diagram of the optimized telescope model with realistic mirrors. <lb/>Fig. 4. Model in OSLO of the CTA-LST telescope. <lb/> design data were used instead, with FoV under 1 mrad [16-19]. <lb/>These profiles allow achieving a better PSF due to the use of <lb/>aspheric optics in order to reduce the pixel size, and hence the <lb/>cost and size of the cameras, which can be built using smaller <lb/>photodetectors (APDs instead of PMTs). This design constraint <lb/>will be also an advantage for adapting the telescope to FSOC. <lb/> E. Background noise <lb/> To characterize the link in terms of SNR, the background <lb/>noise power needs to be calculated. Eq. (2) must be solved for <lb/>the worst scenario. The sky radiance L(λ,θ,ϕ) has been <lb/>computed using MODTRAN, the usual reference for <lb/>background noise computation in FSOC link budgets [21]. <lb/>Following the suggestions from OLSG, the simulations used a <lb/>minimum Sun-Earth-probe angle of 5° and a maximum <lb/>observation zenith angle of 70°. The aerosol model applied was <lb/>a maritime one, with 23-km visibility, taking into account a site <lb/>like La Palma (Spain) for CTA North. Desert aerosol from <lb/>Sahara also reaches Canary Islands, but the altitude of the <lb/>observatory (2390 m) is usually beyond the influence of such <lb/>an air mass. <lb/>As an example, fig. 7 shows the MODTRAN simulated sky <lb/>radiance for a solar zenith angle (SZA) of 45°, azimuthal angle <lb/>of 0° and observation zenith angles from 0° to 90°. The highest <lb/>curve is the one with equal observation and solar zenith angles. <lb/>Sweeping the SZA for a wavelength of 1550 nm, the results in <lb/>fig. 8 are obtained, after limiting the observation zenith angle <lb/>to 70° and SEP angle to 5°. The average of all the maximum <lb/>sky radiance values has been considered in this work as a worst <lb/>case for daylight operation, giving a result of <lb/>430 µW/(cm 2 ·srad·µm). <lb/>Next step is computing eq. (2) using the previous result. For <lb/>noise power calculations, a spectral band Δλ of 0.01 nm has <lb/>been considered, although new filtering techniques can <lb/>improve this figure in one order of magnitude [22-24]. For <lb/>receivers, quantum efficiency has been taken as 75%, although <lb/>90% values have been achieved recently [25]. Background <lb/>noise NS is therefore estimated as 70.69 nW for the LST as the <lb/>worst case, 18.35 nW for MST-DC and 15.95 nW for SST-DC. <lb/>SC configurations improve these values several orders of <lb/>magnitude, thanks to their better optical resolution, which <lb/>makes it possible to reduce the FoV: the NS for SST-SC ASTRI <lb/>is 0.183 nW, being 0.052 nW for SST-SC GATE, and <lb/>0.041 nW for MST-SC. <lb/>Night operation is also affected by background noise. In a <lb/>link with another planet, its albedo is the highest contribution. <lb/>For example, background noise power from Mars is computed <lb/>with eq. (2) but using Mars irradiance IM (in W/cm 2 ·µm) <lb/>instead of the radiance L due to the fact that Mars will be <lb/>always included in the receiver&apos;s FoV. Eq. (4) was used to <lb/>compute IM [26]. <lb/> IM =AM ·(IS/dM-S 2 )·(RM/dM-T) 2 <lb/> (4) <lb/> where AM is the 25% Mars albedo, IS = 28.7 mW/(cm 2 ·µm) is <lb/>the solar irradiance at 1 astronomical unit for 1500 nm, dM-S is <lb/>the 1.52366 astronomical units Mars-Sun distance, RM is the <lb/>3390 km Mars radius, and dM-T is 68.6·10 6 km, Mars-Earth <lb/>distance in Mars opposition scenario, which is the case during <lb/>nighttime. The background power NM by Mars albedo is then <lb/>calculated with the eq. (5), resulting in 445 pW for LST, 120 <lb/>pW for MST-DC and 7 pW for SST-DC. <lb/> NM =IM ·π (D/2)  2  ·Δλ <lb/> (5) <lb/> F. Link budgets <lb/> The link budget equation [21] applied to a downlink as the <lb/>one simulated here is given by eq. (6), being Pr (dBm) the <lb/>power at the receiver, Pt (dBm) the average transmitted power, <lb/> Gt (dB) the transmitter gain, Lt (dB) the internal transmitter <lb/>losses, Ltp (dB) the transmitter pointing losses, Lfs (dB) the <lb/>free-space propagation losses, Latm (dB) the losses by <lb/>atmospheric propagation, Gr (dB) the receiver gain, Lr (dB) the <lb/>internal losses of the receiver and Lrp (dB) the receiver pointing <lb/>losses. <lb/> Pr = Pt + Gt – Lt – Ltp – Lfs – Latm + Gr – Lr – Lrp <lb/> (6) <lb/> Fig. 8.

(6) has been used for each telescope and for several <lb/>realistic scenarios: LEO (Low Earth Orbit), Lagrange points 1 <lb/>and 2, Moon and Mars in conjunction and opposition (fig. 9). <lb/>For the transmitter and other general parameters, the data from <lb/>the scenario study suggested by the OLSG [20] was used (see <lb/>table II). The rest of the link budget parameters were calculated <lb/>from the simulations presented in the previous sections. <lb/>As an example of operation, L1 scenario is shown in <lb/>fig. 10. L1 is as a worst-case scenario regarding background <lb/>noise. FoV and detection areas have been superimposed to the <lb/>SNR in the plot for each CTA telescope. As can be seen, SNR <lb/>is not dependent on the collection area, but on the FoV (the <lb/>higher the FoV, the lower the SNR). It can be concluded that <lb/>under high background, as it is the case of L1, LEO, Moon and <lb/>Mars conjunction, it is the FoV rather than the aperture what <lb/>determines the SNR. This can be used to compare the <lb/>performance of CTA telescopes when applied to FSOC. <lb/>According to this, in the fig. 10 CTA telescopes are shown in <lb/>order of preference from right to left, being MST-SC the most <lb/>advantageous CTA telescope for deep-space communications. <lb/>To check the ability of CTA telescopes to sustain FSOC <lb/>links, in Table III, an overview of link budgets and worst-case <lb/>SNR for each scenario is shown. 3 dB was selected as the link <lb/>margin to overcome. Additionally, the condition of at least one <lb/>photon per pulse per telescope was imposed, assuming the use <lb/>of single-photon detectors, commonly used in quantum <lb/>communications [27] and also recently demonstrated for <lb/>deep-space lasercom links [28]. For each scenario, smaller or <lb/>DC telescopes were first selected over SC to obtain the <lb/>minimum SNR for being the simplest solutions. In nighttime <lb/>and daytime scenarios, the worst-case (daytime) sky radiance <lb/>values were used, and in night-only scenarios the Mars albedo <lb/>background noise was used. Very occasional moon crossings in <lb/>FoV have not been considered. Moon scenario is based on <lb/>NASA&apos;s LLCD, L1 on ESA-NASA&apos;s SOHO mission and L2 <lb/>on ESA&apos;s Euclid mission. <lb/>Receiver&apos;s gain is very important and it is the reason of <lb/>higher SNR even for the smallest CTA telescopes in favorable <lb/>scenarios (especially LEO and L2) where smaller telescopes <lb/>would be enough. For example, G  r  difference in LEO between <lb/>OLSG projected telescope and SST-DC is 17 dB. <lb/>As the Moon scenario is based on NASA&apos;s LLCD, the <lb/>bitrate is variable between 40-622 Mbit/s (depending on the <lb/>background and atmospheric conditions). Here, both the <lb/>maximum bitrate and the worst-case background were used <lb/>simultaneously, as a SST-DC (the simplest CTA solution) <lb/> Fig. 10. Field of view (FoV) and aperture area compared with <lb/>signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each CTA telescope in L1 scenario. <lb/>Fig. 9. Downlink scenarios simulated in this work. <lb/>TABLE II.

For example, instead of <lb/>the 700 Mbit/s assumed by OLSG, a 3.7 Mbit/s link would still <lb/>provide a SNR of 19.28 dB. <lb/>L1 is based on the same transmitter as L2. Hence, in order <lb/>to adapt the link to the worse background conditions, the bitrate <lb/>was reduced and the PPM order increased. This scenario <lb/>suffers from a lot of background noise from the Sun, but one <lb/>MST-DC could still have a link margin of 4.7 dB. If using <lb/>SST-DC, an array of five telescopes would be necessary, as <lb/>each one adds 3 dB, being mandatory at least one photon per <lb/>pulse per telescope. <lb/>Mars opposition shows similar difficulties as L1 regarding <lb/>background noise, adding 30 dB of losses because of the longer <lb/>distance. Increasing the aperture diameter in this case is not <lb/>useful, as Mars albedo is the only background source and it <lb/>enters totally in the FoV, being in this case an irrelevant <lb/>parameter. SST-DC cannot be used in spite of SNR&gt;3 dB, <lb/>because 0.2 photons per pulse would be received. MST-DC is <lb/>the alternative, with a 3.15 dB link margin. <lb/>Mars in conjunction is the worst case scenario: the number <lb/>of background photons per pulse is three orders of magnitude <lb/>above signal photons. The only way to achieve a correct <lb/>detection is using thousands of SST-DC, hundreds of MST-DC <lb/>or tens of SST-SC. Only MST-SC in an array of 3 elements <lb/>could fulfill the 3-dB link requirement. <lb/>Table IV shows a summary of the worst-case SNR for each <lb/>scenario and each CTA telescope when used as FSOC receiver. <lb/>SNR is computed using the above described link budget and <lb/>background noise simulations. Between brackets, the number <lb/>of telescopes in an array configuration to close the link when a <lb/>single telescope is not enough, is indicated. Only L1 with <lb/>SST-DC and Mars in conjunction links are not fulfilled using <lb/>single telescopes. The rest of the cases are feasible with any <lb/>CTA telescope, proving that all the CTA telescopes could be <lb/>used in FSOC links. In this study, the MST-SC was identified <lb/>as the optimum solution and could serve as a ground station for <lb/>all the scenarios except Mars in conjunction, where an array of <lb/>3 elements would be required. <lb/> G. Cost <lb/> Regarding costs, Table V shows a summary of the <lb/>comparative costs between different ground stations. It can be <lb/>seen that the cost of SST-SC is the lowest one, having an <lb/>excellent performance compared with the DC configurations <lb/>and making it possible to close the simulated links in every <lb/>scenario except Mars conjunction. In general, CTA telescopes <lb/>are cost-effective options when compared to FSOC telescopes <lb/>and especially with astronomical telescopes. However, the <lb/>FSOC telescopes include the adaptations for daylight operation <lb/>and CTA telescopes should be also adapted. 1-m class <lb/>telescope is estimated to need 1 M€ adaptation [20]. Scaling <lb/>the costs for bigger apertures, CTA telescopes still would have <lb/>lower cost than previously projected FSOC telescopes. <lb/> H. Additional proposed PSF improvements <lb/> There is still an improvement margin for optical resolution <lb/>in CTA telescopes: PSF size can be reduced by using certain <lb/>techniques in order to employ just one single telescope <lb/>dedicated to FSOC at each CTA site. As exposed previously, <lb/>FoV in CTA telescopes ranges from 0.29 mrad (MST-SC) to <lb/>6.13 mrad (SST-DC), being 0.02 mrad the one assumed at <lb/>OLSG proposals [20]. A brief list of possible adaptations is <lb/>presented here in order to enhance optical performance in CTA <lb/>primary-focus telescopes: <lb/> • New mirrors to prevent aberrations: all the CTA <lb/>primary-focus telescopes use spherical optics to reduce <lb/>costs, since a huge number of mirrors need to be built. <lb/>Aspheric mirrors should be used instead to greatly <lb/>improve the optical resolution, e.g. shaping a parabola <lb/>in LST to approximate to the original structure profile. <lb/>This would be very appropriate for FSOC, as parabolic <lb/>mirrors ideally lack spherical aberration, and the coma <lb/>would not be very harmful when using the narrow FoV <lb/>needed in FSOC. <lb/> • Field corrector based on group of lenses or mirrors near <lb/>the focal plane: they are also made by using aspheric <lb/>optics, as in the case of COSTAR for Hubble telescope <lb/> TABLE V.

FSOC case is also studied in <lb/>[34] or [35], where a segmented spherical reflector is <lb/>covering the 8.3-m central area of a 34-m NASA&apos;s <lb/>Deep-Space-Network RF antenna, and a group of four <lb/>70-cm mirrors is used as a field corrector. <lb/> • Adaptive optics, as in the case of [36] or [37], where 8 <lb/>additional dB could be gained when correcting <lb/>atmospheric turbulence in a deep-space link. However, <lb/>this solution should be studied to assess whether it is <lb/>applicable or not for correcting the big aberrations of <lb/>CTA telescopes. <lb/>IV. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Free-space lasercom holds the promise to alleviate the need <lb/>of faster communications from deep-space. A key step for <lb/>achieving this goal will be the development of a network of <lb/>optical ground stations with very large apertures. However, <lb/>such facilities will require big investments and new ideas are <lb/>needed to minimize costs while maximizing the receiving <lb/>apertures. The reutilization of astronomical facilities has been <lb/>pointed out as a strategic action in this endeavor. A big number <lb/>of Cherenkov telescopes will be built for CTA project in the <lb/>next years. In this work, the feasibility of using CTA telescopes <lb/>for deep-space FSOC has been explored. A deep analysis based <lb/>on all the types of the projected CTA telescopes has been <lb/>carried out. The reflectance of the CTA mirrors has been <lb/>validated at 1550 nm by experimental spectral measurements, <lb/>and a study of the limitations of FoV has been made, <lb/>concluding that the geometrical aberrations are the limiting <lb/>factor in CTA telescopes performance when applied to FSOC. <lb/>A series of OSLO simulations have been carried out to retrieve <lb/>the PSF of each telescope. Other simulations with MODTRAN <lb/>and Matlab were made to obtain the optical link budget for <lb/>realistic scenarios, considering worst cases. <lb/>With the only adaptation of replacing the Cherenkov <lb/>camera by the lasercom equipment and its suitable refocusing <lb/>by a few centimeters towards the focal plane, the possibility of <lb/>using a MST-SC telescope for deep-space FSOC has been <lb/>suggested. This telescope is able to reach over 6-dB SNR for <lb/>every scenario except Mars in conjunction, where an array of 3 <lb/>elements would be necessary to close the link. Three possible <lb/>strategies have been suggested to enhance the optical <lb/>performance of CTA primary-focus telescopes in order to <lb/>improve their optical resolution to minimize their field-of-view <lb/>and the received background noise: using aspherical mirrors, <lb/>field correctors and adaptive optics. A brief discussion of the <lb/>costs of Cherenkov telescopes compared with astronomical and <lb/>communication telescopes was made. The conclusion is that <lb/>the cost of optical ground stations based on Cherenkov <lb/>telescopes would be lower than other dedicated FSOC <lb/>telescope currently projected. <lb/></body>
