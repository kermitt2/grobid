			<body>A <lb/>n appropriate ab T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is <lb/>shaped in the thymus through multiple selection steps. In <lb/>this process, transduction of signals through the TCR <lb/>in CD4 þ CD8 þ double positive (DP) thymocytes determines <lb/>CD4/CD8 lineage specification and generates CD4 þ CD8 À and <lb/>CD4 À CD8 þ single positive (SP) thymocytes. At the DP stage, <lb/>interaction of the TCR with self-peptides on major histocompat-<lb/>ibility complex (MHC) molecules generates positive-selecting <lb/>signals. DP thymocytes that undergo positive selection increase <lb/>their surface expression of CD5, CD69 and TCR and differentiate <lb/>into a CD4 þ CD8 int transitional stage. At this stage, persistent <lb/>TCR signalling promotes CD4 lineage specification through a <lb/>series of transcriptional programs 1 . However, the molecular <lb/>mechanisms by which the signal duration is translated into <lb/>specific responses have yet to be fully defined. <lb/>It is well established that sequential tyrosine phosphorylation <lb/>events triggered by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as Src-, <lb/>Syk-and Tec-family PTKs, orchestrate TCR signalling during <lb/>T cell development 2 . Serine/threonine kinases also regulate T cell <lb/>development by controlling transcriptional and metabolic <lb/>programs 3 . Until now, loss of several serine/threonine kinases <lb/>has been reported to result in defective T cell development 4-10 . <lb/>However, the crosstalk between serine/threonine kinase and <lb/>tyrosine phosphorylation cascade is not clearly understood. <lb/>PKD, initially called PKCm, is a serine/threonine kinase family <lb/>now classified within the CaMK group and separated from the <lb/>AGC group (named for PKA, PKG and PKC) 11 . The three <lb/>isoforms, PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3, are encoded by different <lb/>genes, prkd1, prkd2 and prkd3, respectively. All PKD isoforms <lb/>have a highly conserved amino acid sequence with a <lb/>diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding domain, pleckstrin homology <lb/>(PH) domain and kinase domain 11 . Among them, PKD2 is <lb/>abundantly expressed in T cells 12,13 and is phosphorylated on <lb/>TCR stimulation 14 . In addition, constitutively active PKD2 drives <lb/>T cell development 15 . However, thymic selection was not grossly <lb/>disturbed in PKD2-deficient mice 13 . Until now, no studies have <lb/>addressed the role of PKD in thymocyte development using mice <lb/>lacking all PKD isoforms, and the downstream substrates of PKD <lb/>in thymocytes have not fully been elucidated. <lb/>Inhibitory signalling molecules, such as protein tyrosine <lb/>phosphatases (PTPs), modulate TCR signalling and thus <lb/>contribute to setting the threshold for thymocyte selection 16,17 . <lb/>In particular, SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 <lb/>(SHP-1) is reported to regulate thymic selection through a <lb/>variety of proposed mechanisms 18-21 . The inhibitory activity of <lb/>SHP-1 is regulated by binding to the phosphorylated targets via <lb/>SH2 domains and by phosphorylation of its C-terminal tyrosines <lb/>(Try 536 and Tyr 564 ) 17,22 . However, the role of serine/threonine <lb/>phosphorylation in the function of SHP-1 remains unclear 23 . <lb/>In this study, we established mice lacking all PKD isoforms in <lb/>T cells. The generation of CD4 SP thymocytes is impaired in these <lb/>T cell-specific PKD-deficient mice. Using a phosphoproteomic <lb/>approach, we identify SHP-1 as a direct substrate for PKD. The <lb/>phosphorylation of SHP-1 by PKD positively regulates TCR <lb/>signalling. Collectively, we demonstrate that the PKD-SHP-1 axis <lb/>is required for CD4 þ T cell development. <lb/>Results <lb/>PKD is phosphorylated in preselection DP thymocytes. We first <lb/>investigated whether PKD is activated on TCR engagement in <lb/>thymocytes by evaluating phosphorylation of its activation loop. <lb/>To address this, &apos;unengaged&apos; DP thymocytes that have never <lb/>encountered self-peptides were prepared. To obtain preselection <lb/>thymocytes bearing antigen-specific TCR, bone marrow (BM) <lb/>cells from OT-I TCR Tg mice were transferred into transporter <lb/>associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient mice, which <lb/>lack functional MHC class I. The preselection thymocytes were <lb/>stimulated with OVA peptides that differ in affinity such as <lb/>OVA 257-264 (SIINFEKL) (strong agonist), T4 (intermediate <lb/>agonist) and G4 (weak agonist). To evaluate PKD activation, <lb/>we established anti-phospho-PKD1/2/3 Abs that recognize <lb/>phosphorylated activation loops containing a common sequence <lb/>shared by all PKDs (Fig. 1a).

			<body>assessed by anti-phospho-PKDs Abs, was induced by low-affinity <lb/>peptides (Fig. 1b), implying a role for PKD in positive selection. <lb/>We next examined the PKD isoforms expressed in thymocytes. <lb/>Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that <lb/>thymocytes express abundant PKD2, less PKD3 and undetectable <lb/>PKD1 mRNA (Fig. 1c,d), as previously reported 13 . The lack of <lb/>PKD1 expression in thymocytes was further verified by evaluating <lb/>mRNA copy number using a molecular indexing assay (Fig. 1e) 24 . <lb/>To generate T cells lacking all PKD isoforms, we established T <lb/>cell-specific PKD2/PKD3 double-deficient mice using Lck-Cre Tg <lb/>mice (PKD2/3 DT ) (Fig. 2a,b). We confirmed that none of the <lb/>three PKD isoforms was expressed in PKD2/3 DT thymocytes <lb/>using Abs reacting with PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3 (Fig. 2c,d). <lb/>Defective T cell development in PKD2/3 DT mice. In PKD2/3 DT <lb/>mice, the proportion and number of CD4 SP thymocytes were <lb/>markedly lower compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas <lb/>those from single-deficient (PKD2 DT or PKD3 DT ) mice were not <lb/>altered (Fig. 3a,b). These trends were more prominent in the <lb/>TCR hi -gated mature CD4 SP population (Fig. 3a, lower panels). <lb/>Consistent with the reduction of CD4 SP cells, PKD2/3 DT mice <lb/>had small and fragmented thymic medulla (Fig. 3c). The above <lb/>results might be due to a possible survival defect of CD4 SP cells <lb/>(Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 1), as Bcl-2 expression was reduced <lb/>by half in PKD2/3 DT cells (Fig. 3e). However, this possibility <lb/>seems unlikely as promotion of survival by a Bcl-2 transgene in <lb/>PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 3f) failed to restore the proportion and <lb/>number of CD4 SP thymocytes (Fig. 3g,h). Thus, PKD is likely to <lb/>regulate CD4 SP cell generation beyond any effects on survival. <lb/>A small number of CD4 SP thymocytes in PKD2/3 DT mice <lb/>expressed lower levels of TCR and CD5 on the cell surface <lb/>(Fig. 3i). This phenomenon was also observed in CD8 SP cells, <lb/>suggesting that TCR signalling is impaired during positive <lb/>selection in PKD2/3 DT mice. <lb/>Role of PKD in positive and negative selection. To examine the <lb/>role of PKD in positive selection, we crossed PKD2/3 DT mice with <lb/>MHC class II-restricted OT-II TCR transgenic (Tg) mice. In <lb/>OT-II Â PKD2/3 DT mice, the percentage of CD4 SP thymocytes <lb/>was reduced to one-tenth that of PKD-sufficient OT-II mice <lb/>(Fig. 4a), demonstrating that PKD is critically involved in positive <lb/>selection for the CD4 lineage. In the MHC class I-restricted OT-I <lb/>TCR background, the proportion of mature CD8 SP thymocytes <lb/>in PKD2/3 DT mice was reduced compared with that in control <lb/>OT-I Tg mice (Fig. 4b), albeit less severe than in OT-II <lb/>background. Furthermore, the expression of Tg-TCR was lower <lb/>in PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 4a,b, lower panels). Analysis of <lb/>female H-Y TCR Tg mice supported this finding, as CD8 SP <lb/>development was impaired in H-Y Â PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 4c). <lb/>Thus, positive selection for both the CD4 and CD8 lineages is <lb/>impaired in PKD2/3 DT mice, particularly when the abTCR is <lb/>fixed by transgenes. <lb/>We next investigated the function of PKD in negative selection <lb/>using two different models. In male H-Y Tg Â PKD2/3 DT mice, the <lb/>percentage and number of DP thymocytes were significantly higher <lb/>than in control male H-Y Tg mice, suggesting inefficient negative <lb/>selection in PKD-deficient thymocytes (Fig. 4d). Strikingly, male <lb/>H-Y Tg Â PKD2/3 DT mice had CD8 SP thymocytes bearing high <lb/>levels of the H-Y TCR (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, the peripheral T cells <lb/>in male H-Y Tg Â PKD2/3 DT mice expressed normal levels of <lb/>CD8, unlike low-level expression in WT H-Y controls (Fig. 4f). <lb/>These results suggest that the loss of PKD results in a shift of the <lb/>normal positive selection window towards high self-reactivity due <lb/>to impaired TCR signalling in thymocytes. <lb/>For the second model, we used a clonal deletion model <lb/>triggered by endogenous superantigens. Thymocytes bearing <lb/>Vb5 þ and Vb11 þ TCR are deleted in the presence of mtv-8 <lb/>and mtv-9 on I-E (Fig. 4g, H-2 b/d ) 25 . This deletion persisted in <lb/>PKD single-deficient mice; however, it was significantly blocked <lb/>in PKD2/3 DT (H-2 b/d ) mice (Fig. 4g, left panels). Irrelevant <lb/>Vb6 þ cells were not affected by the absence of PKD (Fig. 4g, <lb/>right panel). Thus, these two models reveal that PKD is involved <lb/>in negative selection. <lb/>Collectively, our results indicate that PKD is critical for positive <lb/>selection to the CD4 lineage and is also required for optimal <lb/>positive selection to the CD8 lineage and negative selection. <lb/>Impaired CD4 þ CD8 int thymocyte generation by loss of PKD. <lb/>DP thymocytes stimulated with positive-selecting peptides <lb/>express CD69 and then differentiate into CD4 þ CD8 int inter-<lb/>mediate cells, which are the precursors to both CD4 and CD8 SP <lb/>thymocytes 1 . Although the number of CD69 þ DP cells was not <lb/>altered in PKD2/3 DT mice, the CD4 þ CD8 int subpopulation was <lb/>significantly decreased (Fig. 5a).

			<body>TCR Tg backgrounds (Fig. 5b), indicating that PKD is required <lb/>for the transition from the DP to the CD4 þ CD8 int <lb/>stage. Consistent with this, the CD4 þ CD8 int population in <lb/>PKD2/3 DT mice showed lower expression levels of CD5 than in <lb/>WT mice, suggesting that loss of PKD led to the attenuation of <lb/>TCR signalling during differentiation of DP to CD4 þ CD8 int <lb/>stage (Fig. 5c). <lb/>To confirm this assumption, we conducted two-step differ-<lb/>entiation assay in vitro. During recovery culture after cross-<lb/>linking of TCR and co-receptor, DP thymocytes differentiate into <lb/>CD4 þ CD8 int cells (Fig. 5d), as previously reported 26 . However, <lb/>PKD2/3 DT DP thymocytes generated a much lower percentage of <lb/>CD4 þ CD8 int cells than WT thymocytes after this treatment <lb/>(Fig. 5d). Collectively, these results suggest that PKD regulates the <lb/>TCR signals required for transition of DP to CD4 þ CD8 int <lb/>thymocytes during positive selection. <lb/>PKD mediates signals triggered by weak-affinity peptides. To <lb/>evaluate the strength of TCR signals, we performed quantitative <lb/>assays using OVA peptide variants to stimulate thymocytes from <lb/>TCR Tg mice. Ag peptide-induced co-receptor downregulation is <lb/>a molecular indicator of the strength of TCR signalling in DP <lb/>thymocytes 27 . Indeed, stimulation of thymocytes from OT-II <lb/>TCR Tg mice resulted in co-receptor downregulation in <lb/>accordance with the peptide affinity as seen using OVA 323-339 <lb/>(strong agonist), R9 (weak agonist) and F9 (very weak agonist) <lb/>(Fig. 5e, open circles) 28 . However, the responses were suppressed <lb/>in PKD-deficient OT-II thymocytes, even on stimulation with the <lb/>R9 variant (Fig. 5e, closed circles). Likewise, upregulation of <lb/>CD69 and CD5 was also reduced in the absence of PKD (Fig. 5f). <lb/>To further investigate, we stimulated thymocytes bearing OT-I <lb/>TCR. Again, the co-receptor downregulation faithfully reflected <lb/>the peptide affinity: namely, OVA 257-264 is the most potent, <lb/>followed by T4 and G4 (Fig. 5g, open circles). We found that in <lb/>the absence of PKD, the response was significantly attenuated <lb/>when stimulated with a low-affinity variant, G4, which is known <lb/>as a positive-selecting ligand (Fig. 5g, closed circles) 29 . These <lb/>findings suggest that PKD is required for TCR signalling triggered <lb/>by weak-affinity ligands, which is consistent with the above <lb/>observation that positive selection is severely affected in <lb/>PKD2/3 DT mice. <lb/>PKD is involved in CD4 lineage specification. As the generation <lb/>of CD4 SP cells was more severely affected than CD8 SP cells in <lb/>PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 3a,b), we next investigated whether PKD <lb/>influences CD4 lineage commitment.

			<body>should give rise to CD8 SP cells even in the absence of MHC class <lb/>I (in an MHC class II-dependent manner), which is called <lb/>&apos;CD8-redirection&apos; (refs 30,31). To address this possibility, <lb/>we transferred BM cells from WT or PKD2/3 DT mice to <lb/>TAP-deficient mice. PKD-deficient BM cells, but not WT <lb/>BM cells, gave rise to mature CD8 SP thymocytes even <lb/>in TAP-deficient hosts lacking functional MHC class I (Fig. 6a), <lb/>suggesting that PKD2/3 DT cells are defective in lineage <lb/>commitment to CD4 SP thymocytes. <lb/>In fact, expression of ThPOK, a critical regulator of <lb/>CD4 lineage commitment 32 , was decreased in PKD2/3 DT <lb/>CD4 þ CD8 int cells, whereas Runx3, a transcription factor <lb/>essential for CD8 lineage specification, was not decreased <lb/>(Fig. 6b). Forced expression of ThPOK restored the percentage <lb/>of CD4 SP thymocytes to nearly WT levels (Fig. 6c). However, the <lb/>expression of the CD5 maturation marker in CD4 þ CD8 int cells <lb/>remained low even in the presence of ThPOK transgene (Fig. 6d). <lb/>Thus, these results suggest that PKD regulates the development of <lb/>38.9 <lb/>9.9 <lb/>25.0 <lb/>54.4 <lb/>Vα2 <lb/>Vα2 <lb/>OT-I <lb/>10.6 <lb/>2.6 <lb/>CD8 <lb/>CD4 <lb/>H-Y (f) <lb/>11.4 <lb/>3.4 <lb/>CD8 <lb/>CD4 <lb/>T3.70 <lb/>42.7 <lb/>34.3 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>Frequency (% of CD4 SP) <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>Vβ11 + <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>H-2 b/b <lb/>H-2 b/d <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>* <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>** <lb/>4.2 <lb/>29.9 <lb/>CD8 <lb/>CD4 <lb/>OT-II × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>OT-I × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>3.0 <lb/>OT-II <lb/>33.7 <lb/>CD8 <lb/>CD4 <lb/>CD8 <lb/>CD4 <lb/>3.2 <lb/>10.4 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>** <lb/>WT PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>CD8 <lb/>H-Y × PKD2/3 ΔT (f) <lb/>H-Y (m) <lb/>H-Y × PKD2/3 ΔT (m) <lb/>DP cells (× 10 7 <lb/>) <lb/>H-Y (m) <lb/>H-Y × PKD2/3 ΔT (m) <lb/>H-Y (m) <lb/>H-Y × PKD2/3 ΔT (m) <lb/>WT <lb/>PKD2 ΔT <lb/>PKD3 ΔT <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>WT <lb/>PKD2 ΔT <lb/>PKD3 ΔT <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>WT <lb/>PKD2 ΔT <lb/>PKD3 ΔT <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>Vβ6 + <lb/>Vβ5 + <lb/>a <lb/>b <lb/>c <lb/>d <lb/>e <lb/>g <lb/>f <lb/>Figure 4 | Impaired positive and negative selection in the absence of PKD.

			<body>CD4 SP cells through at least two mechanisms: (i) promotion of <lb/>TCR signals in the DP stage that trigger transition to the <lb/>CD4 þ CD8 int stage; and (ii) specification of CD4 lineage <lb/>development via a ThPOK-dependent process. <lb/>SHP-1 is a PKD substrate in thymocytes. The above results <lb/>demonstrate that PKD promotes TCR signalling during thymic <lb/>selection. However, proximal signalling events including Ca 2 þ <lb/>influx and Erk activation following TCR ligation were comparable <lb/>between WT and PKD2/3 DT thymocytes (Fig. 7a,b). Furthermore, <lb/>in DP cells, TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proximal <lb/>signalling molecules, such as CD3z and ZAP-70, as well as <lb/>MAPKs, such as Erk, p38 and JNK, was unaffected by the loss of <lb/>PKD (Fig. 7c). <lb/>On the other hand, expression of a truncated PKD2 transgene <lb/>lacking the kinase domain inhibited the generation of CD4 SP <lb/>thymocytes (Fig. 7d), suggesting that the PKD kinase activity is <lb/>required for thymocyte development. <lb/>Hence, to clarify downstream signalling events, we performed <lb/>an unbiased proteomic search for novel PKD substrates in <lb/>thymocytes. To identify proteins that exhibit TCR-induced <lb/>phosphorylation in WT but not PKD-deficient thymocytes, <lb/>phosphoproteins from unstimulated WT, stimulated WT and <lb/>stimulated PKD2/3 DT thymocytes were labelled with Cy2 (blue), <lb/>Cy3 (red) and Cy5 (green) fluorescent markers, respectively, <lb/>and analysed by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel <lb/>electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) 33 . We detected six &apos;red&apos; spots <lb/>representing proteins that were phosphorylated in a <lb/>stimulation-and PKD-dependent manner (Fig. 8a). These spots <lb/>were identified to be pro-IL-16, SHP-1, NCK1 and Gads by mass <lb/>spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 8a,b; Supplementary Data 1). SHP-1, <lb/>NCK1 and Gads are reported to be involved in T cell <lb/>development 17,34,35 . Phosphate-affinity SDS-PAGE (Phos-tag) <lb/>western blotting 33 showed that the migration of SHP-1, NCK1 <lb/>and Gads was retarded (indicating phosphorylation) in <lb/>stimulated-WT thymocytes (Fig. 8c; Supplementary Fig. 2). In <lb/>PKD2/3 DT cells, the levels of phosphorylation of these proteins <lb/>were reduced (Fig. 8c). In vitro kinase assays with recombinant <lb/>PKD2 and PKD3 revealed that SHP-1, Gads and NCK1 are direct <lb/>substrates for PKD2/3, and were phosphorylated at an efficiency <lb/>similar to substrates previously identified in other tissues <lb/>(Fig. 8d) 36 . We next used MS and site-directed mutagenesis, <lb/>and identified the sites phosphorylated by PKD as SHP-1 Ser 557 , <lb/>Gads Ser 186 and NCK1 Ser 85 (Fig. 8e, Supplementary Fig. 3 and <lb/>Supplementary Data 2). Notably, these sites are similar in <lb/>sequence to the PKD consensus phosphorylation motif, <lb/>L/V/IxRxxpS/T (Fig. 8f) 37 . <lb/>These substrates were also phosphorylated in OT-I thymocytes <lb/>on stimulation with various OVA peptides as assessed by <lb/>Phos-tag western blotting. Among these substrates, the phos-<lb/>phorylation of SHP-1 was largely dependent on PKD2/3 (Fig. 9a). <lb/>In order to further examine SHP-1 phosphorylation in vivo, <lb/>tryptic phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO 2 from each <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>* <lb/>W T <lb/>P K D 2 /3 Δ T <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>W T <lb/>P K D 2 /3 Δ T <lb/>b <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>5 <lb/>WT <lb/>** <lb/>(μg ml <lb/>-1 ) <lb/>(μg ml -1 ) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>** <lb/>CD5 <lb/>WT <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>T4 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>OVA 257-264 <lb/>Dulling (%) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>G4 <lb/>OT-I <lb/>Log [peptide(M)] <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>OVA 323-339 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>Dulling (%) <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-10 -8 -6 -4 <lb/>-12 -10 -8 -6 <lb/>-12 -10 -8 -6 <lb/>-12 -10 -8 -6 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>Log [peptide(M)] <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>Log [peptide(M)] <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>R9 <lb/>F9 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>OVA 323-339 <lb/>R9 <lb/>F9 <lb/>OT-II <lb/>OT-II × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>OT-II × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>OT-I × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>OT-II <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>30 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>30 <lb/>Log [peptide(M)] <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>30 <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>CD5 + <lb/>cells (%) <lb/>CD69 + <lb/>cells (%) <lb/>CD4 + <lb/>CD8 int <lb/>cells (%) <lb/>anti-TCRβ <lb/>anti-CD2 <lb/>CD69 + <lb/>DP cells (× 10 6 <lb/>) <lb/>CD4 + <lb/>CD8 int <lb/>cells (× 10 6 <lb/>) <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>** <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>** <lb/>CD4 + <lb/>CD8 int <lb/>cells (× 10 6 <lb/>) <lb/>O <lb/>T -I <lb/>O <lb/>T -I × <lb/>P K D <lb/>2 / 3 Δ T <lb/>O <lb/>T -I I <lb/>O <lb/>T -I I × <lb/>P K D <lb/>2 / 3 Δ T <lb/>a <lb/>c <lb/>d <lb/>e <lb/>f <lb/>g <lb/>Figure 5 | Role of PKD in early differentiation of DP thymocytes. <lb/>(a) Average cell number of CD69 þ DP and CD4 þ CD8 int thymocytes from <lb/>WT and PKD2/3 DT mice was analysed by flow cytometry. *Po0.05. <lb/>(b) Average cell number of CD4 þ CD8 int thymocytes from OT-I or OT-II Tg <lb/>mice. **Po0.01.

			<body>thymocyte. The liquid chromatography (LC)-MS data revealed <lb/>that a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino <lb/>acid residues 555-570 was increased by TCR stimulation in a <lb/>PKD2/3-dependent manner (Fig. 9b, Supplementary Fig. 4 and <lb/>Supplementary Data 3). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) <lb/>analysis confirmed phosphorylation at Ser 557 of endogenous <lb/>SHP-1 derived from stimulated-WT thymocytes (Fig. 9c). Finally, <lb/>we developed an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated <lb/>Ser 557 in SHP-1. TCR stimulation increased the levels of <lb/>phospho-Ser 557 SHP-1 in thymocytes from WT but not <lb/>PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 9d). These results indicate that PKD <lb/>mediates TCR-induced phosphorylation of Ser 557 in SHP-1. <lb/>Importantly, the Ser 557 amino acid is highly conserved across <lb/>mammalian species (Fig. 9e). <lb/>Mutant SHP-1 (SHP-1 S557A ) suppresses thymocyte development. <lb/>To further examine the role of the SHP-1 phosphorylation in T <lb/>cell development, we turned to the DPK cell line, a pigeon <lb/>cytochrome c (PCC)-specific DP cell line that retains the potential <lb/>to undergo differentiation in vitro 38 . Stimulation of DPK cells <lb/>with cognate peptide on I-E k resulted in downregulation of <lb/>CD8 expression and differentiation into CD4 SP cells as <lb/>previously reported 38 (Fig. 10a, Mock). Forced expression of a <lb/>phosphorylation-defective mutant of SHP-1 (SHP-1 S557A ) <lb/>reduced the generation of CD4 SP cells (Fig. 10a). Likewise, <lb/>SHP-1 S557A also inhibited CD5 upregulation induced by peptide <lb/>stimulation (Fig. 10b). These results suggest that SHP-1 S557A can <lb/>suppress TCR signalling in a dominant negative manner and <lb/>that phosphorylation of Ser 557 in SHP-1 promotes TCR signalling. <lb/>We finally examined the in vivo relevance of the phospho-<lb/>rylation of Ser 557 in SHP-1 by establishing knock-in mice <lb/>expressing mutant SHP-1 (SHP-1 S557A/S557A mice) (Fig. 10c). <lb/>Thymocytes from SHP-1 S557A/S557A mice expressed comparable <lb/>amount of SHP-1 to that of WT, whereas TCR-induced <lb/>phosphorylation was impaired (Fig. 10d), indicating that Ser 557 <lb/>is a major phosphorylation site on TCR stimulation. To address <lb/>the role of this site, we evaluated the ability of SHP-1 S557A/S557A <lb/>thymocytes to develop into SP cells in the context of competition <lb/>with WT. CD3e-deficient (CD3e D5/D5 ) mice lacking T cells were <lb/>transferred with mixed BM cells from CD45.1 þ WT and <lb/>CD45.2 þ SHP-1 S557A/S557A mice and analysed after T cell <lb/>reconstitution. SHP-1 S557A/S557A thymocytes showed impaired <lb/>development into CD4 SP population compared with WT <lb/>thymocytes (Fig. 10e), indicating that Ser 557 is required for the <lb/>optimal generation of CD4 SP thymocytes. Collectively, these <lb/>results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser 557 in SHP-1 can <lb/>positively regulate TCR signalling in DP thymocytes to promote <lb/>T cell development. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we established T cell-specific PKD-deficient mice to <lb/>characterize the role of PKD in T cell development. PKD appears <lb/>to control the generation of CD4 SP thymocytes through <lb/>promoting (i) TCR signalling during positive selection, and <lb/>(ii) CD4 lineage specification. Since the decreased number of <lb/>CD4 þ CD8 int cells in PKD2/3 DT mice was restored by a Bcl-2 <lb/>transgene (Fig. 3h), an important function of PKD during positive <lb/>selection may be promoting survival that allows DP cells to <lb/>differentiate into the CD4 þ CD8 int stage. On the other hand, <lb/>defective CD4 lineage specification on loss of PKD is likely due to <lb/>the incomplete induction of ThPOK during positive selection, <lb/>as CD4/CD8 ratio was restored by ThPOK transgene, but not by <lb/>Bcl-2. Optimal ThPOK induction requires &apos;duration&apos; of TCR <lb/>signalling during positive selection 39 . In contrast, the expression <lb/>of Runx3, a transcription factor essential for CD8 lineage <lb/>specification, is controlled by TCR-induced immediate <lb/>upregulation of IL-7R and subsequent IL-7 signalling 40 . As <lb/>Runx3 induction occurred normally in PKD-deficient mice <lb/>(Fig. 6b), PKD is apparently dispensable for the transient TCR <lb/>signalling required for Runx3 induction. In this respect, we <lb/>speculate that another critical role of PKD may be to maintain the <lb/>&apos;duration&apos; of TCR/co-receptor signalling after sensing a weak-<lb/>affinity ligand. Consistent with this idea, PKD was efficiently <lb/>activated by stimulation with weak-affinity peptide variants in <lb/>preselection DP thymocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5). <lb/>PKD2 is abundantly expressed in thymocytes, while the <lb/>amount of PKD3 is considerably lower.

			<body>demonstrates that a limited amount of PKD3 is sufficient to <lb/>support SP thymocyte generation. The redundant functions of <lb/>PKD2 and PKD3 in T cell development suggest that their <lb/>substrate specificities are likely to overlap. Indeed, all substrates <lb/>tested in this study were phosphorylated by both PKD2 and <lb/>PKD3 with similar efficiencies (Fig. 8d). The PKD consensus <lb/>phosphorylation motif has been reported to be L/V/IxRxxS/T 37 . <lb/>The new phosphorylation sites that we have identified <lb/>herein are similar but not identical to this motif (Fig. 8f). <lb/>This finding underscores the important contribution of <lb/>unbiased phospho-proteomics 33,41 , in addition to motif-based <lb/>approaches 42 , in identifying novel kinase substrates. <lb/>It has been suggested that SHP-1 dephosphorylates several key <lb/>molecules involved in TCR signalling mainly through interactions <lb/>with ITIM-containing transmembrane proteins 17 . Recently, <lb/>Themis, a molecule critical for positive selection, was reported <lb/>to recruit SHP-1 to antagonize TCR signalling, thereby <lb/>preventing the apoptosis of DP cells that encountered weak <lb/>agonists during positive selection 43 , although some debate <lb/>exists 44 . Given that loss of Themis or PKD cause similar defects <lb/>in T cell development, one might speculate that PKD also <lb/>antagonizes TCR signalling to ensure positive selection. However, <lb/>this possibility seems less likely, as the expression levels of CD5, <lb/>CD69 (Fig. 5f) and Nur77 (Supplementary Fig. 6), which <lb/>represent the summation of TCR signalling intensity 45,46 , were <lb/>reduced in PKD-deficient cells.

			<body>selection to positive selection has been reported in mice with <lb/>defective TCR signalling, such as ZAP-70-mutated mice <lb/>or CD3z À / À mice 47,48 , similar to what we observe herein <lb/>for PKD2/3 DT mice (Fig. 4e,f). In contrast, in Themis À / À mice, <lb/>proximal TCR signalling is enhanced rather than attenuated 43 . <lb/>Therefore, although PKD and Themis can both act on SHP-1, <lb/>they appear to regulate TCR signalling in opposite directions. The <lb/>generation of Themis À / À Â PKD2/3 DT triple-deficient mice will <lb/>clarify this issue. <lb/>What is the molecular basis for the positive signalling resulting <lb/>from the phosphorylation of Ser 557 in SHP-1? There are at least <lb/>three possibilities: First, the phosphorylation by PKD may <lb/>constrain the inhibitory function, such as phosphatase activity, <lb/>of SHP-1. Alternatively, the phosphorylation might alter the <lb/>proper cellular localization of SHP-1 away from the area where <lb/>efficient inhibition of TCR signalling takes place. Indeed, a 6-mer <lb/>motif including Ser 557 in SHP-1 is reported to regulate its <lb/>subcellular localization 49 . Second, we cannot rule out the <lb/>possibility that serine-phosphorylated SHP-1 dephosphorylates <lb/>proteins containing tyrosines that on phosphorylation, negatively <lb/>regulate TCR signalling. For example, SHP-1 dephosphorylates <lb/>the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Src family PTKs in <lb/>osteoblasts to activate their kinase activities 50 . Third, SHP-1 <lb/>may function as an adaptor rather than a phosphatase through <lb/>its C-terminal phospho-Ser 557 , and may recruit positive <lb/>regulators into the vicinity of the TCR.

			<body>be extremely intriguing to identify the protein(s) that selectively <lb/>bind to Ser 557 -phosphrylated SHP-1. Johnson et al. 51 recently <lb/>reported that T cell-specific SHP-1 deletion using Cd4-Cre Tg <lb/>mice had no obvious effect on T cell development. This may be <lb/>explained by the loss of both positive and negative regulation via <lb/>SHP-1 in thymocytes lacking SHP-1 protein. <lb/>The observation that the defects found in SHP-1 S557A/S557A <lb/>mice are milder than that of PKD2/3 DT mice could be explained <lb/>by a possible contribution of other PKD substrates, such as Gads <lb/>and NCK1. Indeed, co-transfection of phosphorylation-defective <lb/>forms of three other PKD substrates (Gads, NCK1 and pro-IL-16) <lb/>together with SHP-1 S557A resulted in more severe impairment in <lb/>CD5 upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, we cannot <lb/>exclude the possibility that PKD might control T cell develop-<lb/>ment by modulating multiple TCR signalling pathways through <lb/>various substrates in addition to SHP-1. <lb/>Histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is also reported to be a <lb/>substrate for PKD 52 and we confirmed this in in vitro kinase <lb/>assay (Fig. 8d), whereas we could not detect PKD-dependent <lb/>phosphorylation of HDAC7 in thymocytes by 2D-DIGE <lb/>Relative abundance <lb/>WT (+) <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>PKD2/3 ΔT (+) <lb/>21.70 <lb/>7.52 <lb/>5 10 15 20 25 <lb/>Time (min) <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>WT (-) <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>TSpSKHKEEVYENVHSK <lb/>1 <lb/>557 <lb/>0.31 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>OVA 257-264 <lb/>T4 <lb/>G4 <lb/>OT-I <lb/>0 5 15 30 60120 0 5 15 30 60120 (min) <lb/>Blot: <lb/>anti-<lb/>SHP-1 <lb/>Mouse <lb/>HAKASRTSSKHKEEVY <lb/>HAKASRTSSKHKEEVY <lb/>HAKASRTSSKHKEDVY <lb/>HAKASRTSSRHKDEVY <lb/>HAKASRTSSKHKEDVY <lb/>HAKASRTSSKHKDEVY <lb/>557 <lb/>SH2 SH2 <lb/>Phosphatase <lb/>SHP-1 <lb/>e <lb/>-+ -+ <lb/>WT PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>anti-CD3 <lb/>anti-pSHP-1(Ser 557 ) <lb/>anti-SHP-1 <lb/>Blot: <lb/>Rat <lb/>Pig <lb/>Bovine <lb/>Chimpanzee <lb/>Human <lb/>100 <lb/>100 <lb/>100 <lb/>(kDa) <lb/>y 1 4 <lb/>b 2 <lb/>b 3 <lb/>b 5 <lb/>b 6 <lb/>b 7 <lb/>b 8 <lb/>b 9 <lb/>b 1 0 <lb/>b 1 1 <lb/>b 1 2 <lb/>b 1 3 <lb/>y 1 2 <lb/>y 1 1 <lb/>y 1 0 <lb/>y 9 <lb/>y 8 <lb/>y 7 <lb/>y 6 <lb/>y 5 y 4 y 3 y 2 y 1 <lb/>557 <lb/>K <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>V <lb/>N <lb/>E <lb/>Y <lb/>V <lb/>E <lb/>E <lb/>K <lb/>H <lb/>K <lb/>S <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>PH <lb/>1.5e+5 <lb/>HCD FT MS/MS <lb/>Precursor MS (4+) = m/z 496.23 <lb/>1.0e+5 <lb/>Ion current <lb/>5.0e+4 <lb/>0.0e+0 <lb/>% of base peak <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>20 <lb/>0 <lb/>b2-H <lb/>2 O <lb/>y2-H <lb/>2 C <lb/>y5 ++ <lb/>y3 <lb/>b6-H <lb/>2 O-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>++ <lb/>y3-H <lb/>2 O <lb/>b7-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>++ <lb/>b8-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>++ <lb/>b5-NH <lb/>3 -H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>b5-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>b9 ++ <lb/>y5-H <lb/>2 O <lb/>y10 ++ <lb/>b10 ++ <lb/>b11-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>++ <lb/>y11 ++ <lb/>y6-NH <lb/>3 <lb/>y6 <lb/>y12 ++ <lb/>b13 ++ <lb/>y14-H <lb/>3 PO <lb/>4 <lb/>++ <lb/>y7 <lb/>y5 <lb/>y7 ++ <lb/>y4 <lb/>y8 ++ <lb/>y1-NH <lb/>3 <lb/>y1 <lb/>y2 <lb/>b2 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>600 <lb/>700 <lb/>800 <lb/>900 <lb/>m /z <lb/>OT-I × PKD2/3 ΔT <lb/>SHP-1 <lb/>b <lb/>a <lb/>c <lb/>d <lb/>Figure 9 | SHP-1 is phosphorylated by PKD2 and PKD3 at Ser 557 in thymocytes.

			<body>(Fig. 8a,b). HDAC7-deficient mice show poor generation of SP <lb/>thymocytes 53 . However, the phenotype of PKD-deficient mice is <lb/>unlikely to be attributed to HDAC7, as loss of HDAC7 results <lb/>in unique phenotypes, such as limited usage of TCR Ja segments, <lb/>which are not observed in PKD2/3 DT mice. In addition, in <lb/>HDAC7-deficient mice, the introduction of TCR transgenes <lb/>(OT-I or OT-II) reduced rather than exacerbated the defect in <lb/>thymocyte development 53 , which contrasts with the phenotypes <lb/>seen in PKD-deficient mice. <lb/>Currently, the pathway upstream of PKD during thymic <lb/>selection is not clearly understood. PKD is activated by binding to <lb/>DAG and, more importantly, by phosphorylation of serine <lb/>residues in the activation loop (Ser 707/711 in PKD2 and Ser 731/735 <lb/>in PKD3) 3 . In T cells, classical as well as novel PKCs, including <lb/>PKCa, d, e, Z and y, are implicated in the phosphorylation of <lb/>these residues 14 . Among them, PKCy and PKCZ are abundantly <lb/>expressed in DP thymocytes, and recently, PKCy À / À PKCZ À / À <lb/>double-deficient mice were demonstrated to have a decreased <lb/>number of SP thymocytes compared with single-deficient mice 54 . <lb/>In this regard, one can speculate that PKDy and PKCZ <lb/>act as upstream regulators of PKD after TCR engagement in <lb/>thymocytes. This hypothesis warrants further investigation. <lb/>In conclusion, we propose that the PKD represents one of the <lb/>molecular switches that converts weak TCR engagement to <lb/>positive selection and CD4 lineage specification. The critical roles <lb/>of PTKs and PTPs in thymic selection have been clearly <lb/>established. The present study brings to light the additional <lb/>importance of serine/threonine kinases as key modulators of TCR <lb/>signalling cascade regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation during <lb/>thymic selection. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Mice.

RNA extracted from DP thymocytes of WT mice was <lb/>reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers containing molecular indexing labels. <lb/>ds cDNA was amplified with gene-specific primers and fluorescent dye-labelled <lb/>universal primers. The number of labels in amplified ds cDNA was detected by <lb/>microarray hybridization with Pixel System (Cellular Research). <lb/>Cell survival assay. Thymocytes were cultured in medium at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . <lb/>After incubation for different times, cells were stained with APC-conjugated <lb/>anti-CD4, PE-conjugated anti-CD8, FITC-conjugated Annexin V at the <lb/>concentration described in the &apos;Cells and reagents&apos; section and propidium iodide at <lb/>room temperature for 15 min, and immediately analysed by flow cytometry. <lb/>In vivo negative selection model. C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice were backcrossed onto <lb/>B10.D2 (H-2 d ) mice and analysed for the expression of Vb5, Vb6 and Vb11. <lb/>Thymocytes expressing Vb5 or Vb11 are deleted by binding of Mtv-8 and Mtv-9 <lb/>superantigens only when I-E is also expressed. Thus, deletion occurs on H-2 b/d but <lb/>not H-2 b/b backgrounds. Thymocytes expressing Vb6 are not deleted by these <lb/>superantigens. <lb/>Two-step differentiation assay. In vitro differentiation of CD4 þ CD8 int <lb/>thymocytes was performed using purified DP thymocyets 26 . Thymocytes in <lb/>RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) charcoal-and dextran-treated <lb/>FBS were plated on 96-well plates at 5 Â 10 5 cells per well and stimulated for 20 h <lb/>in wells coated with 5 mg ml À 1 anti-TCRb and 10 mg ml À 1 anti-CD2. Cells were <lb/>washed and immediately analysed for CD4 and CD8 expressions by flow cytometry <lb/>(stimulatory culture) or transferred to a new plate, washed extensively, and <lb/>cultured for another 20 h in same medium, followed by the analysis for the <lb/>expression of CD4 and CD8 by flow cytometry (recovery culture). <lb/>Co-receptor downregulation assay (Dulling assay). Co-receptor downregulation <lb/>was examined using OT-II thymocytes or preselection OT-I thymocytes 27 . Overall, <lb/>1 Â 10 5 thioglycollate-induced peritoneal cells were used as APC and pulsed with <lb/>peptides before the addition of thymocytes (1.5 Â 10 5 -5.0 Â 10 5 ) for stimulation of <lb/>OT-II thymocytes. To stimulate preselection OT-I thymocytes, peptides were loaded <lb/>on MHC class I expressed on thymocytes themselves. The expression of CD4 and <lb/>CD8 was analysed by flow cytometry after 16-20 h. <lb/>BM chimera for quantification of redirection. For the analysis of <lb/>CD8-redirection, BM cells from WT or PKD2/3 DT mice were suspended <lb/>in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 Â 10 7 cells were injected into <lb/>8 Gy-irradiated TAP À / À mice. Then, 6 weeks after BMT, mice were dissected <lb/>and thymocytes were analysed. For mixed BM transfer, CD3e D5/D5 mice were <lb/>transferred with 5 Â 10 6 each of CD45.1 þ WT and CD45.2 þ SHP-1 S557A/S557A <lb/>BM cells and analysed 4 weeks after BMT. <lb/>Ca 2 þ mobilization. Thymocytes were freshly isolated and loaded with 1.2 mM <lb/>Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes) in phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 5% FBS for <lb/>30 min at 30 °C. After washing, cells were stained with anti-CD3, phycoerythrin-<lb/>conjugated anti-CD8 and PerCP-Cy5.5 -conjugated anti-CD4 at the concentration <lb/>described in the &apos;Cells and reagents&apos; section for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed, <lb/>suspended in PBS containing 5% FBS, prewarmed to 37 °C before analysis and <lb/>were kept at 37 °C during event collection on FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson). <lb/>For cell stimulation, various concentrations of goat anti-hamster IgG were added to <lb/>crosslink anti-CD3 Abs. Maximum Ca 2 þ influx was obtained by the addition of <lb/>10 mM ionomycin (Calbiochem). Mean fluorescence ratio was calculated by FlowJo <lb/>software (Tree Star). <lb/>Intracellular staining. For intracellular staining of phosphorylated proteins, <lb/>thymocytes were stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 at the <lb/>concentration described in the &apos;Cells and reagents&apos; section for 30 min on ice and <lb/>cross-linked by goat anti-hamster IgG as described above. Cells were washed, fixed <lb/>and permeabilized using cytofix/cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) for pCD3z, <lb/>pErk, pp38 and pJNK staining or fixation/permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) <lb/>for pZAP70 staining.

			<body>2D-DIGE. Thymocytes were freshly isolated and cultured for 16 h to upregulate <lb/>TCR. Cells were then incubated with 10 mg ml À 1 anti-CD3 mAb for 30 min on ice <lb/>and stimulated by cross-linking by 100 mg ml À 1 goat anti-hamster IgG Ab for <lb/>2 min at 37 °C. The unstimulated WT, stimulated WT and stimulated PKD2/3 DT <lb/>cells were lysed and phosphoproteins were enriched using PhosphoProtein <lb/>Purification Kit (Qiagen). The interfering non-protein materials were subsequently <lb/>removed by 2-D Clean Up Kit (GE Healthcare). Overall, 30 mg of the resultant <lb/>phosphoproteins were minimally labelled with 400 pmol Cy2, Cy3 or Cy5 <lb/>fluorescent dye (CyDye DIGE Fluors, GE Healthcare) for 30 min on ice. After <lb/>quenching the labelling reaction with 10 nmol lysine, differentially labelled samples <lb/>were mixed and subjected to first-dimension isoelectric focusing on immobilized <lb/>pH gradient strips (24 cm; pH4-7) using an Ettan IPGphor II system. The <lb/>second-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out on 10% acrylamide gel. The Cy2, <lb/>Cy3 and Cy5 signals were individually acquired with a Typhoon 9400 scanner <lb/>(GE Healthcare). <lb/>Phos-tag western blotting. Lysates from thymocytes were subjected to PAGE <lb/>clean up kit (Nacalai tesque) before phosphate-affinity SDS-PAGE is performed <lb/>using 6-7.5% acrylamide gels containing 25 or 50 mM Phos-tag acrylamide (Wako <lb/>chemicals) and 50 or 100 mM MnCl 2 . After electrophoresis, gels were washed in <lb/>Trans-Blot Turbo transfer buffer (Bio-Rad) added with 1 mM EDTA for 15 min <lb/>and then incubated in the buffer without EDTA for 15 min. Proteins were <lb/>transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using Trans-Blot <lb/>Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) with the program for HIGH molecular weight <lb/>proteins (1.3A, 25 V, 10 min) and analysed by immunoblotting. For l protein <lb/>phosphatase (l PP) treatment, lysates were treated with l PP for 30 min at 30 <lb/>°C <lb/>before purification using PAGE clean up kit. <lb/>Preparation of GST fusion proteins. SHP-1, Gads and NCK1 cDNAs were cloned <lb/>into pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). For the mutant GST fusion proteins, <lb/>Ser 557 and Ser 591 of SHP-1, Ser 186 of Gads and Ser 85 of NCK1 were changed <lb/>to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The vectors were transformed into <lb/>E. coli BL21 and GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione sepharose <lb/>(GE Healthcare). <lb/>In vitro kinase assay. For in vitro kinase assay using [g-32 P]ATP, 2 <lb/>GST-SHP-1, GST-Gads and GST-NCK1 were incubated with 50 ng active PKD2 or <lb/>PKD3 (Carna Bioscience) and 100 mM [g-32 P]ATP (5 mCi) in 20 ml kinase buffer <lb/>(5 mM MgCl 2 and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was <lb/>stopped by addition of sample buffer followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Half of <lb/>the sample was subjected to 5-20% gradient SDS-PAGE and CBB staining. <lb/>Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. <lb/>Identification of proteins and peptides by LC-MS/MS analysis. The 2D-DIGE <lb/>gel was silver-stained (Thermo Scientific) and protein spots were excised and <lb/>digested with trypsin (Promega). The obtained peptides were analysed by a <lb/>capillary liquid chromatography system (Waters/Micromass) connected to a <lb/>Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters/Micromass). Raw data were acquired <lb/>and processed using MassLynx version 4.0. (Waters/Micromass) to generate a peak <lb/>list file for MS/MS ion search. The peak list files were searched against the NCBI <lb/>non-redundant protein database restricted Mus musculus using the MS/MS ion <lb/>search on Mascot search engine (Matrix Science). To identify in vitro phosphor-<lb/>ylation sites, GST fusion proteins phosphorylated by active PKD2 or PKD3 were <lb/>subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and <lb/>protein bands were excised and digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were <lb/>analysed by an ADVANCE UHPLC (Michrom Bioresources) connected to an <lb/>Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (for GST-Gads and GST-NCK1) or by an <lb/>EASY-nLC1000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an Orbitrap <lb/>Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (for GST-SHP-1). <lb/>Identification of phosphopeptides by LC-MS/MS analysis. The unstimulated <lb/>WT, stimulated WT and stimulated PKD2/3 DT thymocytes were lysed in buffer <lb/>containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 M urea, 1 mM DTT and PhosSTOP <lb/>phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysates were sonicated and cleared by <lb/>centrifugation at 20,000g at 4 °C for 15 min. Proteins (each 50 mg) were reduced <lb/>with 5 mM DTT for 30 min and alkylated with 27.5 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min <lb/>in the dark. The urea concentration was then reduced to 1 M before addition of <lb/>0.5 mg trypsin. After 4 h at 37 °C, the digestion was quenched by acidification <lb/>with 0.5% TFA. The digests were desalted using InertSep RP-1 (GL Sciences), <lb/>concentrated and adjusted to binding conditions for TiO 2 -based phosphopeptide <lb/>enrichment (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% TFA and 300 mg ml À 1 lactic acid). <lb/>Phosphopeptides were enriched using 50 mg of Titansphere Phos-TiO column <lb/>(GL Sciences) in accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Peptides were <lb/>eluted with 200 ml of 5% ammonia and then with 200 ml of 5% pyrrolidine. <lb/>The collected eluates were acidified with TFA and desalted using GL-Tip SDB <lb/>(GL Sciences). LC-MS/MS analysis of enriched phosphopeptides was performed <lb/>on an EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a <lb/>Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were <lb/>separated on an EASY-Spray column (15 cm Â 75 mm, PepMap C18, 3 mm) with a <lb/>linear gradient from 4 to 28% ACN in 0-100 min followed by increase to 80% ACN <lb/>in 100-110 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent <lb/>acquisition mode with a top 10 MS/MS method. Raw data were converted to the <lb/>mgf files using Proteome Discoverer version 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which <lb/>were then searched against the SwissProt database restricted to M. musculus using <lb/>the MS/MS ion search on Mascot search engine. The false discovery rate was set to <lb/>be o0.01. To generate extracted ion chromatograms, the raw data were processed <lb/>using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). <lb/></body>
