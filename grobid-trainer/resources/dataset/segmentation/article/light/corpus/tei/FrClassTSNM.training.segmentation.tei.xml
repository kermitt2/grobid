			<body> 1. Introduction. A Homogenization-Based Numerical Method is a numerical method that incor-<lb/>porates in its conception concepts coming from Homogenization Theory. Doing this gives to the <lb/>built method the capability to tackle efficiently heterogeneities or oscillations. This approach can be <lb/>applied to problems occurring in a heterogeneous medium, that have oscillating boundary conditions <lb/>or that are constrained to oscillate by an external action (for instance a magnetic field on a charged <lb/>particle cloud). <lb/>This topic is currently active. The goal of this special issue is to emphasis recent advances in this <lb/>topic in a wide variety of application fields. <lb/>This introductory paper introduces a classification of Homogenization-Based Numerical Methods, <lb/>in which stand: Direct Homogenization-Based Numerical Methods; H-Measure-Based Numerical <lb/>Methods; Two-Scale Numerical Methods and TSAPS: Two-Scale Asymptotic Preserving Schemes. <lb/>2. Direct Homogenization-Based Numerical Methods.

			<body>It is when we face with an operator O  ε  that generates in solution u  ε  of equation O  ε  u  ε  = 0 oscillations <lb/>or heterogeneities of characteristic size ε -which is small -and when it is known that, in some sense, <lb/>for small ε, u  ε  (z) is close to u(z) for which is known a well-posed problem O u = 0. <lb/>In this context, it is possible, in place of building a numerical approximation of operator O  ε  , to <lb/>build a numerical operator O  ∆z  approximating O. Then solving O  ∆z  u  ∆z  gives a solution u  ∆z  (z) <lb/>which is close to u and consequently to u  ε  (z), when ε is small. This approach permits to obtain an <lb/>approximation of u  ε  (z) without resolving the oscillations the model to compute it contains. <lb/>In the case when a corrector result is known, i.e, if in association with u(z), a function u  1  (z), <lb/>solution to well-posed equation O  1  u  1  = 0, is such that u  ε  (z) is close to u(z) + εu  1  (z) for small ε, it <lb/>is possible build two numerical operators O  ∆z  and O  1 <lb/> ∆z  that are discretizations of O and O  1  . Using <lb/>them, we can compute approximated solutions u  ∆z  (z) and u  1 <lb/> ∆z  (z) of u(z) and u  1  (z) and obtain a <lb/>good approximation of u  ε  (z) computing u  ∆z  (z) + εu  1 <lb/> ∆z  (z). Such a method is called order-1 Direct <lb/>Homogenization-Based Numerical Methods and is illutrated by the following diagram. <lb/> u  ε  solution to <lb/> O  ε  u  ε  = 0 <lb/> ε → 0 <lb/> / / <lb/> u, u1 solutions to <lb/> O u = 0 <lb/> O  1  u  1  = 0 <lb/> u∆z, u∆z solution to <lb/> O  ∆z  u  ∆z  = 0 <lb/> O  1 <lb/> ∆z  u  1 <lb/> ∆z  = 0 <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> (2.2) <lb/>The paper by Legoll &amp; Minvielle [10], by Laptev [9], by Bernard, Frénod &amp; Rousseau [3], and by Xu <lb/>&amp; Yue [13] of this special issue may enter this framework <lb/>3. H-Measure-Based Numerical Methods. The context of those kind of methods is when the <lb/>transition from a microscopic scale (of size ε) to a macroscopic one (of size 1) -with quantities of <lb/>interest at the microscopic scale that are not the same as the quantities of interest at the macroscopic <lb/>scale -needs to be described. This occurs for instance in the simulation of phenomena some parts <lb/>of which call upon quantum description or in the simulation of turbulence. This context can be <lb/>represented by the following diagram: <lb/> u  ε  solution to <lb/> O  ε  u  ε  = 0 <lb/> e  ε  = E(u  ε  ) <lb/> ε → 0 <lb/> / / <lb/> e solution to <lb/> M e = 0 <lb/> u  ε <lb/> ∆z  solution to <lb/> M  ε <lb/> ∆z  e  ε <lb/> ∆z  = 0 <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ε → 0 <lb/> / / <lb/> u∆z solution to <lb/> M  ∆z  e  ∆z  = 0 <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> (3.1) <lb/>and explained as follows. The part in the top left of diagram (3.1) symbolizes a problem which is <lb/>set at the microscopic level. This problem writes O  ε  u  ε  = 0 and generates oscillations in its solution <lb/>

			u  ε  . Besides, the quantity that makes sense at the macroscopic level is e  ε  ; it is related to u  ε  by a <lb/>non-linear relation e  ε  = E(u  ε  ) and it is, in some sense, close to e solution to M e = 0 (see the top <lb/>right of the diagram) which represents the model at the macroscopic level. <lb/>Then, the goal of a H-Measure-Based Numerical Method consists in building a numerical operator <lb/> M  ε <lb/> ∆z  , giving a numerical solution e  ε <lb/> ∆z  close to e  ε  , for any ε as soon as ∆z is small (see the bottom <lb/>left of the diagram), which behaves as a numerical approximation of M when ε is small (see the <lb/>bottom right of the diagram). <lb/>The paper by Tartar [12] of this special issue lays the foundation of the theory for those kinds of <lb/>methods. <lb/>4. Two-Scale Numerical Methods. The papers by Assyr, Bai &amp; Vilmar [1], Back &amp; Frénod [2], <lb/>Faye, Frénod &amp; Seck [5], Frénod, Hirtoaga &amp; Sonnendrücker [6], Lutz [11] and Henning &amp; Ohlberger <lb/>[7] of this special issue are related to this framework of Two-Scale Numerical Methods. <lb/>An order-0 Two-Scale Numerical Method may be explained using the following diagram: <lb/> u  ε  solution to <lb/> O  ε  u  ε  = 0 <lb/> ε → 0 <lb/> / / <lb/> ε → 0 , two-scale  ) ) <lb/> R <lb/> R <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/> u solution to <lb/> O u = 0 <lb/> U solution to <lb/> O U = 0 <lb/> 񮽙 <lb/> Z <lb/> dζ <lb/> 6 6 <lb/> n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/> u∆z solution to <lb/> O  ∆z  u  ∆z  = 0 <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> U∆z solution to <lb/> O  ∆z  U  ∆z  = 0 <lb/> ∆z → 0 <lb/> O O <lb/> 񮽙  Num <lb/> Z <lb/> dζ <lb/> 6 6 <lb/> n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/> (4.1) <lb/>The context includes the one of Direct Homogenization-Based Numerical Methods and diagram (4.1) <lb/>has to be regarded as a prism. Its deepest layer is nothing but diagram (2.1). Yet, if more is known <lb/>about the asymptotic behavior of u  ε  , i.e. if it is known that u  ε  (z) is close to U (z,  z <lb/> ε  ), with U (z, ζ) <lb/> periodic in ζ, when ε is small (which can be translated as u  ε  (z) Two-Scale Converges to U (z, ζ)) and <lb/>if it is known a well posed problem O U = 0 for U (see the middle of the diagram), that gives the <lb/>equation for u (see the top right of the diagram) when integrated with respect to periodic variable <lb/> ζ, it is possible to build a specific numerical method. <lb/>This method consists in building a numerical approximation O  ∆z  of operator O. Using this operator <lb/>can give a numerical solution U  ∆z  (see the bottom of the diagram) and U  ∆z  (z,  z <lb/> ε  ) is an approxima-<lb/>tion of u  ε  (z) for small ε. To be consistent with the continuous level, a numerical integration of the <lb/> O  ∆z  U  ∆z  = 0 needs to yield a numerical approximation of the equation for u (see the bottom right <lb/>of the diagram). <lb/>When a little more is known concerning the asymptotic behavior of u  ε  when ε is small, i.e. if u  ε  is <lb/>close to U (z,  z <lb/> ε  ) + εU  1  (z,  z <lb/> ε  ) with U  1  (z, ζ) also periodic in ζ and if a well-posed problem is known for <lb/> U  1  , we can enrich diagram (4.1) and obtain the following diagram of order-1 Two-Scale Numerical <lb/>

An Asymptotic Preserving Scheme to approximate problem O  ε  u  ε  = 0 (see the top left of the <lb/>diagram) is a numerical operator O  ε <lb/> ∆z  that gives, when solving O  ε <lb/> ∆z  u  ε <lb/> ∆z  = 0 (see the bottom right <lb/>of the diagram) a numerical solution u  ε <lb/> ∆z  which is close to u, with an accuracy depending on step <lb/> ∆z and not on ε.

The deepest one is the diagram of <lb/>the AP-schemes. At the top left of this layer is found the equation that generates in its solution <lb/>oscillations of size ε. At the top right stands the limit problem, as ε is small. (This limit problem <lb/>is assumed to be an order-1 problem, i.e. u  ε  ∼ u  0  + εu  1  for ε small and equations are known for u  0 <lb/> and u  1  .)

This is a numerical method that <lb/>gives a solution U  ε <lb/> ∆z  which depends on two variables z and ζ. When taken in ζ = z/ε, U  ε <lb/> ∆z  gives <lb/>a numerical approximation of the solution to the problem given at the top right of the diagram, <lb/>with an accuracy that only depends on the discretization step ∆z, and not on ε. Moreover, as ε is <lb/>small, the TSAPS O  ε <lb/> ∆z  needs to mimic the behavior of the order-1 Two-Scale Numerical Operator <lb/>(the couple (O, O  1  )). To builtd a TSAPS, a reformulation of problem O  ε  u  ε  = 0 calling upon a <lb/>Two-Scale Macro-Micro Decomposition (that reads O  ε  U  ε  = 0, see the middle of the diagram) is <lb/>used. A first step towards TSAPS is led in Crouseilles, Frénod, Hirstoaga &amp; Mouton [4]. <lb/></body>
