			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>1.1 Modeling social influences with heterogeneous agents <lb/>There are many circumstances in social and economic contexts where, faced with different <lb/>alternatives, the best choice for an individual depends on the choices of other individuals in the <lb/>population. The decision of leaving a neighborhood [78], to attend a seminar [78] or a crowded <lb/>bar [2, 3], to participate to collective actions such as strikes and riots [46], are particular <lb/>examples taken from social sciences. It has been suggested that social interactions may explain <lb/>the school dropout [24], the persistence in the educational level within some neighborhoods [30] <lb/>and the related consequences in the stratification of investment in human capital and economic <lb/>segregation [11], the large dispersion in urban crime through cities with similar characteristics <lb/>[42], the emergence of social norms [71], the labor market behavior and related unemployment <lb/>patterns [88, 86], the housing demand [96], the existence of poverty traps [34], the smoking <lb/>behavior [56, 55, 83], etc. <lb/>Similarly, there is a growing economic literature that recognizes the influence on consumers <lb/>of the social world they live in. In market situations like the subscription to a telephone <lb/>network [5, 75, 90, 25] or the choice of a computer operating system [52], the willingness to <lb/>pay generally depends not only on the individual preferences but also on the choice made by <lb/>others [81, 76]. If the externality is positive the utility of the most popular choice increases even <lb/>for individuals who otherwise would never make this choice. In other words, the conformity <lb/>effect may dominate the heterogeneity of preferences, as pointed out by Bernheim [12]. General <lb/>aspects of these issues have been discussed in the literature [10, 60]. Particular insightful papers <lb/>are Becker&apos;s note [9] about restaurants pricing, and the qualitative analysis by Granoveter and <lb/>Soong [47] of the consequences of interpersonal influences (&quot;bandwagon effects&quot;[57, 76]) on the <lb/>consumers demand and on the supply prices. <lb/>In the present paper we consider the general properties of a model of socially interacting <lb/>heterogeneous individuals that make a binary choice in a context of positive endogenous ex-<lb/>ternalities. The model encompasses, as particular cases, most of the above mentioned models <lb/>presented in the sociology and economics literature. In a forthcoming paper [44] we explore the <lb/>consequences of the externalities on the economy, taking as an example the simplest market, <lb/>i.e. that of a monopolist pricing a single good. <lb/>In social sciences, the question of discrete (typically binary) choices with heterogeneous <lb/>agents and positive externalities has been first addressed in the 70&apos;s by Schelling [77, 78], who <lb/>borrowed from Physics the concept of critical mass: in a repeated-decisions setting, depending <lb/>on whether this critical mass is or not reached, the system may end up at very different equi-<lb/>libria. Granovetter further develops Schelling&apos;s model, applying it to particular problems such <lb/>as joining or not a riot [46], voting, etc [47]. The same topic is reconsidered within a statis-<lb/>tical physics point of view in the early 80&apos;s by Galam et al [39]. The notion of critical mass <lb/>is then related to the Physics concept of phase transition at a critical point, in the neighbor-<lb/>hood of which the system may be extremely susceptible: by tipping effects, small microscopic <lb/>changes can lead to drastic changes at the macroscopic level. Similar tools have been applied <lb/>in 1980 by Kindermann and Snell [53] to the study of social networks. These authors intro-<lb/>duced into the sociology and economics literature the equivalence between statistical physics <lb/>approaches -that use the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution-and Markov Random Fields. An-<lb/>other physically-inspired approach for modeling social phenomena such as opinion diffusion <lb/>has been developed by Weidlich and Haag [93, 92] in 1983, through a master equation and <lb/>the Fokker-Planck approximation. Later, these physically inspired models of opinion contagion <lb/>have been exploited in economics by Orléan [69, 70] for the analysis of mimetic behaviors in <lb/>the context of financial markets. There is now a large and growing literature on opinion and <lb/>innovation diffusion (see e.g. [89, 49, 26, 91, 84]) closely related to the general discrete choice <lb/></body>

			<body>model considered in this paper. Since the beginning of the 90&apos;s the general framework of social <lb/>interactions in non-market contexts is reconsidered in a Beckerian way [8, 10], in particular by <lb/>Glaeser et al [41, 42, 40]. <lb/>The first application of statistical mechanics approaches in economics may be traced back <lb/>to the pioneering work of Fölmer [36]. Introducing an economic interpretation of the Ising <lb/>model of ferromagnetism at finite temperature, he shows that strong externalities may hinder <lb/>the stabilization of an economy. These models introduce Markov random fields (equivalently <lb/>Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions) to model uncertainty in the decision making process, allowing <lb/>for the definition of a general equilibrium concept. According to Fölmer, Hildebrand&apos;s [48] justi-<lb/>fication of the representative agent approach breaks down when agents&apos; decisions are correlated <lb/>due to their social interactions (for a discussion, see also [54]). <lb/>A renewal of interest for models of binary decisions with externalities arose in economics <lb/>in the 90&apos;s. On one side, Durlauf and collaborators [27, 28, 29, 30] and Kirman and Weis-<lb/>buch [94] among others, consider agents that choose an action according to a Boltzmann-Gibbs <lb/>distribution, that is a logistic choice function, reflecting some random aspects in the agent&apos;s <lb/>utility. In this context Brock [19] and Blume [13, 14] explicit the links between Game Theory <lb/>and Statistical Mechanics, while Kirman and coworkers [67] show that the logistic choice func-<lb/>tion may be seen as resulting from an exploration-exploitation compromise. These and other <lb/>recent papers [4, 31, 32, 20, 21, 40, 95, 35, 45, 65, 16] analyze with statistical physics tools the <lb/>consequences of positive social (market and non-market) interactions in the aggregate behavior <lb/>of large populations (for a short introduction to statistical physics approaches see [43] and for <lb/>their application to economics see [72]; see also [7] for a survey). Most of the above mentioned <lb/>authors restrict the analysis of the model to the case where all the individuals have the same <lb/>idiosyncratic preference. Heterogeneity in the population is introduced through the probabilis-<lb/>tic decision-making process (random utility model [58, 59]), like in Fölmer&apos;s work [36]. Then, <lb/>the actual equilibrium reached by the system depends on the fixed points of the decision dy-<lb/>namics, generally a myopic best reply. An interesting characteristic of these models is that they <lb/>present multiple equilibria for some range of the parameters. Becker [9] pointed out important <lb/>consequences of these multiple equilibria, induced by externalities, on the economy: he suggests <lb/>that they could be the reason of seemingly suboptimal pricing in situations of persistent excess <lb/>demand. <lb/>In this paper we consider intrinsically heterogeneous agents with fixed utilities, like in Mc-<lb/>Fadden&apos;s approach to Quantal Choice models [62, 63]. Each individual has an Idiosyncratic <lb/>Willingness to Pay (IWP) that remains fixed on time. We mainly (but not exclusively) decline <lb/>the model within a market context, in which the binary choice corresponds to buying or not a <lb/>given good at a posted price. This general setting allows us to generalize Becker&apos;s qualitative <lb/>analysis [9] of the optimal pricing problem. Putting the price to zero allows us to recover the <lb/>social sciences models. We assume that these IWP are random variables that are distributed <lb/>among the population according to a given probability density function (pdf). <lb/>We determine the possible equilibria of the system without assuming any precise decision-<lb/>making dynamics. We show that the model&apos;s properties depend on the strength of the ex-<lb/>ternality and on qualitative properties of the IWP pdf, like its modality class (the number <lb/>of maxima), its smoothness properties and the kind of support. We display the main results <lb/>on a plane whose axes are the parameters of the model, namely, the average IWP and the <lb/>strength of the social component, both measured in units of the standard deviation of the IWP <lb/>distribution. Particular cases of our model have been published elsewhere [66, 45]. This paper <lb/>extends those result to the case of a general IWP distribution. The particularly important case <lb/>of a uni-modal pdf (with a single maximum) is thoroughly studied, but we also discuss the <lb/>consequences of multi-modality. Our results are summarized on phase diagrams, that is, we <lb/>plot in the parameters space the boundaries of the regions where different types of solutions <lb/>exist. <lb/></body>

			<body>Before entering into the details of our approach (section 2) we discuss the analogies and <lb/>differences between our model and other models of social interactions (section 1.2) and we <lb/>summarize our main results (section 1.3). <lb/>1.2 More on related models <lb/>In this section we briefly discuss the relationship between the model to be considered here <lb/>and other models studied in the literature. Let us first consider models of discrete choices <lb/>in the absence of externalities. According to the typology proposed by Anderson et al. [1], <lb/>within the general framework of Random Utility Models (RUM)[58, 59] with additive stochastic <lb/>utilities, there are two distinct approaches to individual choices: a &quot;psychological&quot; one and an <lb/>&quot;economic&quot; one. In the psychological perspective (Thurstone [87], Luce [58]) the randomness is a <lb/>time-dependent i.i.d. random variable: the random components of the idiosyncratic preferences <lb/>are assumed to be independently drawn afresh by each individual from a given pdf, each time <lb/>the choice has to be made. They are interpreted as individual temporary changes, or mistakes <lb/>in the estimated utilities. In the simplest case -actually, the only one treated in the social <lb/>and economic literature-the agents IWPs have identical deterministic parts and only differ <lb/>by this random time-varying term which is systematically assumed to be drawn from a logistic <lb/>pdf. In practice many approaches like in [20] consider the choice rule as deriving from a random <lb/>utility model [58]. As shown by McFadden [62], in this context the logistic form is obtained if <lb/>the random terms in the underlying Thurstone&apos;s discriminant process are i.i.d. Weibull random <lb/>variables, i.e. have a double exponential (extreme value, type I) distribution (see also [1]). <lb/>In the presence of strategic complementarities ([22, 23]), the resulting model is well known <lb/>in statistical physics: it corresponds to the standard Ising model, i.e. with ferromagnetic in-<lb/>teractions and annealed disorder, that is, at finite temperature T . The latter is the inverse of <lb/>the standard logistic parameter β ≡ 1/T and is thus proportional to the standard deviation of <lb/>the IWP distribution. The ferromagnetic interaction constant J corresponds to the strength <lb/>of the social externality. Introduced by Fölmer [36] in the economics context, this standard <lb/>Ising model has recently been reconsidered in the social and economic literature mainly by <lb/>Durlauf and coworkers [31, 32, 20, 21] and by Kirman and Weisbuch [94, 67]. The correspond-<lb/>ing equilibria are reminiscent of the Quantal Response Equilibria [64] used in the context of <lb/>experimental economics and behavioral game theory. These are equilibria &quot;on the average&quot;, <lb/>in the statistical sense (as in Physics): they do not correspond to the strict maximization of <lb/>the utilities (that are random variables) but to that of their estimated or expected values. In <lb/>the generally considered infinite population limit (where the variance of the expected values <lb/>vanishes) the expected utilities are systematically smaller that the maximal ones. <lb/>The standard Ising model is quite well understood [85]. Ising himself [51] gave an analytic <lb/>description of its properties in the simplest case of a linear chain where each agent interacts only <lb/>with his right and left nearest neighbors. There is also an analytical description of the stationary <lb/>states of the model, due to Onsager [68], in the case where the agents are situated on the vertices <lb/>of a 2-dimensional square lattice, each having four neighbors. However, no analytic results exist <lb/>for arbitrary neighborhoods except for the specific case of a global neighborhood, known as the <lb/>mean field approximation in Physics. Accordingly, considering global neighborhoods, Brock and <lb/>Durlauf [20] analyze the properties of the expected demand in the case of rational expectations <lb/>under the assumption of a logistic distribution of such expectations (assuming thus double <lb/>exponential random utilities). They find, in agreement with standard results in statistical <lb/>mechanics [85], that there exist either one, two or three solutions for the demand function, <lb/>depending on the relative magnitudes of the idiosyncratic uniform social term, the variance of <lb/>the stochastic term and the strength of the social effects. <lb/>In the following we adopt instead McFadden&apos;s [62] economic approach (see also [59, 1]): <lb/>we assume that each agent has a willingness to pay invariable in time, that is different from <lb/></body>

			<body>one agent to the other. In statistical physics this heterogeneity is called quenched disorder. <lb/>The particular model we study is analogous to the ferromagnetic Random Field Ising Model <lb/>(RFIM) at zero temperature (corresponding to the fact that the agents make deterministic <lb/>choices). Thus, our modeling approach assumes the so called &quot;risky&quot; situation: an external <lb/>observer (e.g. a seller) does not have access to the individual preferences, but may know their <lb/>probability distribution. According to McFadden, &quot;Thurstone&apos;s construction is appealing to an <lb/>economist because the assumption that a single subject will draw independent utility functions <lb/>in repeated choice settings and then proceed to maximize them is formally equivalent to a model <lb/>in which the experimenter draws individuals randomly from a population with differing, but <lb/>fixed, utility functions, and offers each a single choice; the latter model is consistent with the <lb/>classical postulates of economic rationality&quot; ([63], p 365). However, in the presence of social <lb/>interactions this statement is in general incorrect. In a repeated choice setting, individual <lb/>utilities evolve in time according to the others&apos; decisions. In fact, the equilibria of systems <lb/>reached through a dynamics that corresponds to an iterated game where agents make myopic <lb/>choices at each time-step is one of the main concerns of statistical physics. It is known that <lb/>the equilibria of systems with annealed or quenched disorder are of very different nature. The <lb/>time average on a single agent and the population average at a given time do not necessarily <lb/>coincide. <lb/>In contrast to the standard Ising model at finite temperature (annealed disorder), the prop-<lb/>erties of the RFIM with externalities, both at zero and at finite temperatures, are far from being <lb/>fully understood. The properties of quenched disordered systems have been and are still the <lb/>subject of numerous studies. Since the first studies of the RFIM, which date back to Aharony <lb/>and Galam [38, 37], a number of important results have been published in the physics literature <lb/>on this model (see e. g. [80]). Several variants of the RFIM have already been used in the <lb/>context of socio-economic modeling, both by physicists and economists [39, 70, 18, 95]. <lb/>The quenched-utilities model (RFIM at zero temperature) and the annealed-disorder model <lb/>(standard mean field Ising model at finite temperature) have the same aggregate behavior <lb/>(i.e. demand function for the market case) and equilibria under the following conditions -but <lb/>essentially only under such conditions: <lb/>1. the choice function with annealed utilities is identical to the cumulative distribution of <lb/>the quenched IWPs; <lb/>2. in the annealed case, equilibrium is reached through repeated best reply choices, where <lb/>the expected demand is myopically estimated; <lb/>3. the population size is infinite, guaranteeing that the variance of the demand vanishes in <lb/>both models. <lb/>However, the economic interpretation of these equilibria are very different: in the case of <lb/>quenched utilities these are standard Nash equilibria, while in the case of annealed utilities <lb/>these are similar (although not identical) to Quantal Response equilibria. <lb/>1.3 Main specific results <lb/>In the present paper we determine the equilibrium properties in the case of a global neighborhood <lb/>with time invariant (quenched) random utilities, in the limit of an infinite number of agents. <lb/>Since our paper focuses on equilibrium (static) properties, the social influence depends on the <lb/>actual choices of the neighbors, in contrast with [20], where the social influence in the surplus <lb/>function depends on the agent&apos;s expected demand. <lb/>Previous studies using annealed or quenched utilities consider specific probability distribu-<lb/>tions, mostly a logistic or a Gaussian [87]. Some papers have determined conditions on the <lb/></body>

			<body>choice function for having multi-equilibria [67, 40]. From the Physics literature we expect that <lb/>specific properties near a critical point (a bifurcation point, see Section 3.2.1 below) are inde-<lb/>pendent of the details of the model: this is used in [80] for describing the hysteresis effects in <lb/>a family of (physical) systems at such a critical point, and exploited in [65] for the analysis of <lb/>empirical socio-economic data in cases where the actual pdfs are not known. However, the full <lb/>description of the phase diagram for an arbitrary pdf has not been done yet. Here we present <lb/>this detailed analysis for a typical probability distribution of the IWP. We show how uniqueness <lb/>or multiplicity of equilibria, related to convexity properties of the inverse demand functions, <lb/>result from modality and smoothness of the pdf, as well as from the strength of the externality. <lb/>We show that for small enough strengths of the social influence (the case of moderate social <lb/>influence in [40]), the demand has a classical shape, that is, with a continuous decreasing <lb/>adoption rate for increasing prices. However, if the ratio between the social influence strength <lb/>and the standard deviation of the IWP distribution exceeds a critical value, the inverse demand <lb/>function exhibits a non-classical, non-monotonic, behavior. As a result, depending on the price, <lb/>there are either one or two stable equilibria for the demand: the positive (additive) externalities <lb/>in a market context may give raise to a family of non-monotonic demand curves generalizing <lb/>thus the classical ones. <lb/>Beyond this first main result, we exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting <lb/>the regions where the system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). We <lb/>call these properties generic since we show that they depend only on qualitative features of <lb/>the IWP distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness (continuity and derivability <lb/>properties) and type of support (compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as <lb/>phase diagrams in the space of the relevant parameters of the model, namely (i) the social <lb/>influence strength and (ii) the difference between the population average of the IWP and the <lb/>posted price, both parameters conveniently normalized by the standard deviation of the IWP <lb/>distribution (which measures the importance of the heterogeneity). <lb/>1.4 Organization of the paper <lb/>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the model: we first (section 2.1) <lb/>specify the agents (customers) model, then in 2.2 we introduce a normalized form of the basic <lb/>equations which is convenient for analyzing the demand, and in 2.3 we show on two simple <lb/>extreme cases what to expect from these equations. In 2.4 we detail the families of probability <lb/>distributions of the IWP covered by this paper. <lb/>In Section 3 we analyze the aggregate demand (its collective behavior) for a generic smooth <lb/>pdf. In 3.1 we introduce and study the direct and inverse demand functions; the demand <lb/>phase diagram is derived in Section 3.2: in 3.2.1 we obtain the domain of multiple solutions <lb/>which allows to plot the phase diagram (section 3.2.3). We analyze in details the vicinity of <lb/>the bifurcation point (section 3.2.4) and the question of Pareto optimality (section 3.2.5). A <lb/>summary of the demand properties is given in 3.3. <lb/>We leave to the Appendix A the analysis of other kinds of pdfs, where we study the demand <lb/>phase diagrams of IWP distributions with compact support (section A.1) and with fat tails <lb/>(section A.2). The demand phase diagram for a pdf with an arbitrary number of maxima is <lb/>studied in A.3 -in details for a smooth multimodal pdf in Section A.3.1, and on a simple <lb/>example of singular bimodal distribution in section A.3.2-. <lb/>Finally we summarize the main results and give several perspectives for further research in <lb/>Section 4. <lb/></body>

			<body>2 Model of discrete choices with heterogeneous agents <lb/>and positive externalities <lb/>2.1 Agents model <lb/>We consider a population of N agents (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ). Each individual i has to make a binary <lb/>choice. Depending on the context, this binary decision may represent the fact of buying or <lb/>not a good, adopting or not a given standard, adopting or not some social behavior such as <lb/>joining a riot [46], or a journal club [77], [78], etc. Formally each agent i must choose a strategy <lb/>ω i in the strategic set Ω = {0, 1} (ω i = 1 denotes to buy/adopt/join, ω i = 0 otherwise) 1 . <lb/>Hereafter, without loss of generality, we will refer to the simplest market situation where the <lb/>agents are customers who must choose whether to buy or not a single good at a price P . Our <lb/>main concern is with the agents&apos; behaviors, and P is considered as an exogenous parameter <lb/>-e.g. it is posted by a monopolist selling the good-. Non-market models like those recently <lb/>considered by, i.e., Glaeser et al. [40] are obtained by setting P = 0 or by considering P as an <lb/>exogenous social cost, common to all the agents. We are interested in the collective outcome of <lb/>the agents decisions. In a following paper [44] focusing on the market context we will analyze <lb/>the consequences of the customers collective behavior on a monopolist&apos;s program for fixing the <lb/>optimal price. <lb/>The population is heterogeneous. Each individual i has an idiosyncratic preference or will-<lb/>ingness to pay/adopt (hereafter IWP) H i , meaning that in the absence of social influences, an <lb/>agent i adopts the state ω i = 1 if H i is larger than the price P . Following Mc-Fadden [62] and <lb/>Manski [59], we work within the framework of Random Utility Models (RUM): we assume that <lb/>the H i are time independent random variables independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) <lb/>in the population. Denoting by H the mean and by σ the variance of the IWP distribution, <lb/>hereafter we assume that the random variable (H i − H)/σ is distributed according to: <lb/>P(x &lt; <lb/>H i − H <lb/>σ <lb/>&lt; x + dx) = f (x)dx, <lb/>(1) <lb/>so that f is a pdf with zero mean and unitary variance. In the RUM view point, the agents <lb/>have utilities H 0 <lb/>i and H 1 <lb/>i for not adopting and adopting respectively, with H 0 and H 1 the <lb/>corresponding population averages. For k = 0, 1, one writes H k <lb/>i = H k + k <lb/>i , where k <lb/>i are <lb/>independent random variables with zero mean and standard deviation σ k , with not necessarily <lb/>identical pdfs for k = 0 and k = 1. Then in our model we have H i = H 1 <lb/>i − H 0 <lb/>i , H = H 1 − H 0 <lb/>and f is the pdf of the normalized difference x i = ( 1 <lb/>i − 0 <lb/>i )/σ, with σ 2 = (σ 0 ) 2 + (σ 1 ) 2 because <lb/>of the additivity of the variances of independent variables. As particular examples, if k <lb/>i are <lb/>Gaussian variables, then x i is also Gaussian; if k <lb/>i are uniformly distributed on, say the intervals <lb/>[−a k , a k ], then x i has a trapezoidal pdf, which becomes a triangular distribution if e.g. a 0 = 0 <lb/>(no uncertainty in the utility of not adopting). In the following we do not assume any specific <lb/>form of the pdf of x. In Section 2.4 below, we present in details the class of pdfs considered in <lb/>this paper. <lb/>If all the individuals had the same IWP, the outcome in absence of social interactions would <lb/>be very simple: either the price is below this common value, and everybody buys, or it is above it <lb/>and nobody buys. All the individuals would behave in the same way, obtaining the same payoffs, <lb/>and in the market aggregate analysis, they may be replaced by a fictitious representative agent <lb/>[54]. In the case of a heterogeneous population considered here, only the agents with H i ≥ P <lb/>would buy at price P , but getting different payoffs. <lb/>The situation is more complex when the decision of each agent depends also on the decisions <lb/>of others ([59] and references therein).

We consider a linear separable surplus, that <lb/>is if agent i buys at the posted price P , his surplus is <lb/>S i = H i + Jη − P, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where η is the fraction of buyers in the population. Taking into account the definition of ω i : <lb/>η ≡ <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>i=1 <lb/>ω i . <lb/>(3) <lb/>We assume also that the externality Jη corresponds to strategic complementarities, i.e. that <lb/>the strength of the social influence is positive: J &gt; 0 2 . <lb/>The actual surplus of agent i is: <lb/>W i = S i ω i . <lb/>(4) <lb/>In order to maximize his surplus, agent i should buy/adopt (ω i = 1) if S i &gt; 0, but not (ω i = 0) <lb/>when S i &lt; 0. Since the IWP are i.i.d., when N is very large (more precisely, in the limit <lb/>N → ∞), by the law of large numbers, the fraction of buyers (3) -which is the average of ω i -<lb/>converges to the expected value of ω i over the IWP distribution. Thus, η is given by the fixed <lb/>point equation: <lb/>η = P(H i − P + Jη &gt; 0). <lb/>(5) <lb/>The marginal customer m, indifferent between adopting or not, is defined by the condition of <lb/>zero surplus, S m = 0: <lb/>H m − P + Jη = 0 <lb/>(6) <lb/>so that (5) may be written as <lb/>η = P(H i &gt; H m ). <lb/>(7) <lb/>For what follows it is more useful to write (5) as <lb/>η = P(H i − H &gt; −S) <lb/>(8) <lb/>where <lb/>S = S(J, H, P ; η) ≡ H − P + Jη <lb/>(9) <lb/>is the population average of the (ex ante) surplus S i . It depends on the parameters J and H, <lb/>which are properties of the customers population, and P , the exogenous price. <lb/>Notation. Generally, upon manipulating functions, we put in parenthesis the parameters <lb/>in front, separated with a semicolon (;) from what we consider the variable. Our notation <lb/>S(J, H, P ; η) in (9) indicates that J, H and P are considered as parameters, whereas η is the <lb/>variable. Sometimes, when the context is clear, we drop down the parameters and keep only <lb/>the variable, writing thus S(η). Whenever we consider functions of two variables, they are <lb/>separated by a simple colon, like in equations (37) and (38), and in Appendix A.3. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2 Aggregate behavior: normalized equations <lb/>Clearly, the fraction of buyers η depends on the strength of the social influence J, the price <lb/>P and the average willingness to pay in the population H, and on the distribution of the <lb/>deviation of the IWP H i from its population average H. The agents choices depend only on <lb/>the surplus sign, and they are invariant under changes of the surplus scale. Since the surplus is <lb/>linear, we can formally multiply every term of the surplus by a same strictly positive number <lb/>without changing the agents&apos; choices. An adequate scale is given by the typical scale of the <lb/>IWP distribution: it is convenient to measure each quantity (J, H, P ) in units of the width σ of <lb/>the IWP pdf. Hence instead of four parameters, we are left with three independent parameters. <lb/>Hereafter we will thus work with the following normalized variables <lb/>j ≡ <lb/>J <lb/>σ <lb/>, h ≡ <lb/>H <lb/>σ <lb/>, p ≡ <lb/>P <lb/>σ <lb/>(10) <lb/>In addition, as it is obvious from equations (8) and (9), η depends on the price P and the <lb/>average willingness to pay H only through their difference H − P . We introduce the normalized <lb/>difference: <lb/>δ ≡ <lb/>H − P <lb/>σ <lb/>= h − p, <lb/>(11) <lb/>which is the average ex-ante surplus in the absence of externality. For short hereafter we call δ <lb/>the bare surplus. In non-market models (p = 0) it is the average willingness to adopt. <lb/>Remark. In (almost) all the following we will work with the above reduced variables (10), <lb/>(11), referring to them as the (normalized) strength of social influence, average willingness to <lb/>pay, price, and bare surplus. However one should keep in mind, especially when interpreting the <lb/>results, that they represent the ratios of the non normalized parameters to the width of the IWP <lb/>distribution. Clearly other normalizations are possible. An alternative of particular interest is <lb/>the normalization obtained by measuring every quantity in units of the social strength J: the <lb/>relevant parameters are theñ <lb/>σ ≡ <lb/>σ <lb/>J <lb/>,h ≡ <lb/>H <lb/>J <lb/>,p ≡ <lb/>P <lb/>J <lb/>,δ ≡ <lb/>H − P <lb/>J <lb/>=h −p <lb/>(12) <lb/>(equivalently one can do as if J = 1). Note that this choice of normalization is no more than an <lb/>equivalent representation of the parameters space; indeed one hasσ = 1/j,h = h/j,p = p/j. <lb/>It is also interesting to analyze the results in term of the set of parameters (12), which allow to <lb/>stress the model properties as a function of the degree of heterogeneity (relative to the strength <lb/>of the social influence) -a homogeneous population corresponding to the limiting caseσ = 0, <lb/>a highly heterogeneous one to a largeσ-. <lb/>With the normalized variables (10), (11), equation (8) becomes <lb/>η = <lb/>∞ <lb/>−s <lb/>f (x)dx = 1 − F (−s), <lb/>(13) <lb/>where F is the cumulative probability distribution and s = S/σ, with S defined by (9), depends <lb/>on h and p through the bare surplus δ, that is <lb/>s = s(j, δ; η) ≡ δ + jη. <lb/>(14) <lb/>If the pdf has infinite support, <lb/>F (−s) ≡ P(x ≤ −s) = <lb/>−s <lb/>−∞ <lb/>f (x)dx. <lb/>(15) <lb/></body>

			<body>In the case of a compact support [x m , x M ], one can write: <lb/>η = 1 − F (−s) = <lb/>max{xM ,−s} <lb/>max{xm,−s} <lb/>f (x)dx. <lb/>(16) <lb/>Obviously, when −s &lt; x m , we have η = 1, and when −s &gt; x M we have η = 0. <lb/>2.3 Hints from two extreme cases <lb/>In the absence of social influence the problem is simple because after introduction of j = 0 <lb/>in (14) we obtain s = δ which does not depend on η. Then, due to the monotonicity of <lb/>cumulative distributions, the fraction of buyers (13) is a monotonically increasing function of δ <lb/>(equivalently, at fixed h, a decreasing function of the price p): <lb/>η = 1 − F (−δ). <lb/>(17) <lb/>Another extreme case is that of a homogeneous population: H i = H for every i -a sit-<lb/>uation obtained in the singular limitσ = 1/j → 0 (the IWP distribution becoming a Dirac <lb/>distribution)-. In that case every agent is faced to exactly the same decision problem, so that <lb/>at equilibrium either η = 0 or η = 1. For each agent the surplus in case of adoption would be <lb/>H − P if no other agent adopt (η = 0), whereas if η = 1 the surplus is H − P + J. In fact, η = 0 <lb/>is a solution for H &lt; P , while η = 1 is a solution for H &gt; P − J. Hence there is a domain, <lb/>P − J &lt; H &lt; P , where the two solutions coexist. The whole population behaves as a single <lb/>agent who either does not adopt, η = 0, or adopts, η = 1, with a different surplus depending on <lb/>whether he is &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out of&quot; the market: this is analogous to the problem of multi-equilibria <lb/>with hysteresis in trade analyzed by Baldwin and Krugman [6], except that here the problem <lb/>arises only at the collective level. <lb/>We have thus on one side, for J = 0 and σ finite, a unique well behaved equilibrium, and for <lb/>J &gt; 0 but σ = 0 a situation of multiequilibria. The question addressed in the following aims <lb/>at understanding what happens &quot;in between&quot;. We will show that when the social interaction <lb/>strength is large enough compared to the heterogeneity width, the demand faces a complex <lb/>problem. More precisely, there is a critical value j B of j = J/σ. Below it, the fraction of buyers <lb/>(equation (13)) follows monotonically the price variations. Beyond j B , equation (13) presents <lb/>multiple solutions. Among them, the (possibly multiple) Nash equilibria are those solutions <lb/>that have an economic meaning, i.e. for which the demand decreases when prices increase. <lb/>The Section 3 of the paper is devoted to a detailed study of the nature of the solutions <lb/>of equations (13) and (14) with j ≥ 0 for distributions satisfying very general smoothness <lb/>hypotheses, detailed in the next section. <lb/>2.4 The idiosyncratic willingness-to-pay distribution <lb/>Since we are interested in the generic properties of the model, we explicit the general charac-<lb/>teristics of the idiosyncratic willingness-to-pay (IWP) distributions covered by our analysis. <lb/>Since a pdf must be integrable, f (x) (equation (1) ) must vanish in the limits x → ±∞. <lb/>For sufficiently regular pdfs, this can happen in two different ways: either the pdf decreases <lb/>continuously to 0 as x → ±∞, or it is strictly zero outside some compact support [x m , x M ]. <lb/>Most of the analysis in this paper is restricted to the class of pdfs obeying to the following <lb/>hypotheses: <lb/>H1. Modality: f is unimodal, that is it has a unique maximum <lb/>f B ≡ sup <lb/>x <lb/>f (x). <lb/>(18) <lb/></body>

			<body>H2. Smoothness: f is non zero, continuous, and at least piecewise twice continuously differ-<lb/>entiable inside its support, ]x m , x M [ , where x m and x M may be finite or equal to ±∞. <lb/>In the latter case f is stricly monotonically decreasing towards zero as x → ±∞. <lb/>H3. Boundedness: the maximum of f , f B (that may be reached at x m or x M if these numbers <lb/>are finite), is finite: <lb/>f B &lt; ∞ <lb/>(19) <lb/>Within the class of pdfs satisfying H1, H2 and H3, we will consider more specifically the <lb/>important following prototypical cases: <lb/>1. Unbounded supports: The support of the distribution is the real axis; the pdf is continuous <lb/>and twice continuously derivable on ] − ∞, ∞[, with a unique maximum. A typical ex-<lb/>ample, relevant to economics (see e.g. [1]), is given by the logistic distribution, although <lb/>more generally we do not assume that the pdf is symmetric. We make the following <lb/>supplementary hypothesis, that amount to impose that the pdf decreases fast enough for <lb/>x → ±∞: <lb/>H4. Mean value: the pdf has a finite mean value. Then, the smoothness condition H2 <lb/>imposes that f decreases when x → ±∞ faster than |x| −1 . <lb/>H5. Variance: the pdf has a finite variance. Then, the smoothness condition H2 imposes <lb/>that f decreases when x → ±∞ faster than |x| −2 . <lb/>2. Compact supports: the support of the distribution is some interval [x m , x M ], with x m and <lb/>x M finite; the pdf is continuous on [x m , x M ] and continuously derivable on ]x m , x M [, with <lb/>a unique maximum on [x m , x M ]. Note that, since f has zero mean, x m &lt; 0 &lt; x M . <lb/>Hypothesis H2 and H3 exclude cases where the pdf is not a function but a distribution -<lb/>containing, e.g., a Dirac delta -. Clearly, if the pdf&apos;s support is the real line, ] − ∞, +∞[, <lb/>the boundedness hypothesis H3 is a consequence of the smoothness hypothesis H2. In the <lb/>case of compact supports, H3 excludes pdfs diverging at a boundary of the support. Although <lb/>hypothesis H3 is actually true under H2 if f is continuous on the closed interval [x m , x M ], we <lb/>explicit it because some of our results are valid under H3 even for pdfs less regular than those <lb/>satisfying H2. <lb/>Although hypothesis H5 is not necessary for the study of the aggregate demand, it corre-<lb/>sponds to a wide family of realistic distributions for which one can conveniently use the standard <lb/>deviation as the unit for measuring the relevant parameters (i.e., using normalization (10)). <lb/>Generic results for unbounded support pdfs satisfying H1 to H5 are presented in the main <lb/>body of the paper. They extend previous results obtained for a logistic distribution [66]. The <lb/>analysis of other types of pdfs is left to Appendix A: <lb/>-In Appendix A.1 we present general results for bounded support pdfs. The case of a <lb/>uniform distribution on a finite interval [x m , x M ], which corresponds to an interesting <lb/>degenerate case (f is maximal at every point within the interval), has been presented <lb/>elsewhere [45]. The particular case of general a triangular pdf is explicitly worked out for <lb/>illustration. <lb/>-In Appendix A.2 we extend the analysis to fat-tail distributions, which correspond to <lb/>an important limiting case of pdfs with infinite variance (for such distributions, the nor-<lb/>malization constant σ in (1) and in equations (10) and (11) is no longer the standard <lb/>deviation, but an arbitrary positive constant setting the units of H, J, P and C). <lb/></body>

			<body>-Finally, in Appendix A.3 we extend the discussion to the case of multimodal pdfs (distri-<lb/>butions with an arbitrary number of maxima): we derive the demand phase diagram for <lb/>a generic smooth multimodal pdf and we discuss the case of a singular pdf using as an <lb/>illustrative example a pdf with two Dirac peaks. <lb/>3 Aggregate choices and coordination dilemma <lb/>In this section we discuss the demand function, that is the relationship between price p and <lb/>fraction of buyers (or adopters, in non market contexts) η, expressed by equation (13). As <lb/>we have already seen, this means studying the relationship between η and the bare surplus <lb/>δ = h − p, and how it depends on the externality parameter j. We show that, for a large range <lb/>of values of the parameters j and δ, the demand presents two equilibria which can be qualified <lb/>as Nash equilibria from a game-theoretic point of view. This result is valid for any pdf satisfying <lb/>the general hypothesis described in the preceding section. <lb/>3.1 The direct and inverse demand functions <lb/>The expected demand η d at a given value of δ is obtained as the implicit solution of (13) and <lb/>(14). As we will see, the application η → 1 − F (−s(η)) may be a multiply valued function <lb/>of η; it is thus preferable to express δ, or p = h − δ, as a function of η, and determine the <lb/>inverse demand function p d (η), that is, the price at which exactly N η units of the good would <lb/>be bought 3 . <lb/>Under the hypothesis H2 the cumulative distribution F is a continuous and strictly mono-<lb/>tonic function on ]x m , x M [ and has a unique inflexion point. Hence it is invertible. Denoting Γ <lb/>the inverse of 1 − F (−s), we have the following equivalence: <lb/>η = 1 − F (−s) ⇐⇒ s = Γ(η), <lb/>(20) <lb/>with s defined by (14). For unbounded supports, Γ(η) increases monotonically from −∞ to +∞ <lb/>when η goes from 0 to 1 (see figure 1 for an example, and Appendix A for other cases). In the <lb/>case of a compact support [x m , x M ], Γ(η) takes the finite values, Γ(0) = −x M , and Γ(1) = −x m <lb/>for η respectively 0 and 1. Note that neither we assume f to be symmetric nor to have its <lb/>maximum at x = 0. <lb/>Replacing s in the r.h.s. of (20) by its expression (14) yields <lb/>δ = D(j; η), <lb/>(21) <lb/>with <lb/>D(j; η) ≡ Γ(η) − jη. <lb/>(22) <lb/>Interestingly, D(j; η) depends on the parameter j but not on h. Actually, in Section 3.2 and in <lb/>Appendix A.3, we will have to consider D(j; η) as a function of the two variables, j and η. In <lb/>the present subsection however, we consider D(j; η) as a function of the single variable η, with <lb/>j as a (fixed) parameter -hence according to our convention on notations introduced in Section <lb/>2.1, we keep in mind the dependency of D on j by writing D(j; η), and derivatives of D(j; η) <lb/>with respect to η are denoted D (j; η). <lb/>Plots of D(j; η) against η for different values of j are presented on figure 2 for the logistic <lb/>distribution. Solutions to (21) correspond to the intersections of these functions with horizontal <lb/>lines at y = δ. <lb/></body>

			<body>The stable equilibrium values of the demand satisfy <lb/>D (j; η) ≥ 0. <lb/>(23) <lb/>Thus, the intersections of y = δ with D when D &lt; 0 correspond to unstable equilibria and will <lb/>be ignored, as explained below. <lb/>Given an externality parameter j and a given value of δ, the solution η = η d (j; δ) of equation <lb/>(21) satisfying (23) gives the expected demand N η d (j; δ) at a price p = h − δ. <lb/>From the definition of δ and (22), the inverse demand function is thus <lb/>p d (η) = h − D(j; η). <lb/>(24) <lb/>This function depends on both parameters h and j, and when necessary we will write p d (η) = <lb/>p d (h, j; η). <lb/>As we will see, the demand η d (j; δ) can be a multivalued function of δ for some range of <lb/>parameters. On the contrary, since the function Γ(η) is a uniquely defined function of η, so is <lb/>D(j; η). This is the reason why, instead of considering (13), we prefer to obtain the properties <lb/>of the demand η d (j; δ) from the analysis of equations (21) and (22). <lb/>Under assumption H2, Γ(η) is at least piecewise three times continuously derivable on ]0, 1[; <lb/>its derivative Γ is continuous and strictly positive. In particular, at any point η in ]0, 1[, we <lb/>have: <lb/>D (j; η) = Γ (η) − j. <lb/>(25) <lb/>In the case of a compact support, the above equation also holds for the right and left derivatives <lb/>at, respectively, η = 0 and η = 1. <lb/>In terms of the pdf f , <lb/>Γ (η) = <lb/>1 <lb/>f (−s) <lb/>, with s = Γ(η). <lb/>(26) <lb/>Under H1, Γ has a unique absolute minimum (qualitatively there is a unique point where the <lb/>curvature of Γ changes from convex to concave; if Γ is smooth, it has a unique inflexion point). <lb/>Thus <lb/>min <lb/>η <lb/>Γ (η) = <lb/>1 <lb/>f B <lb/>&gt; 0. <lb/>(27) <lb/>This minimum is reached at some value η = η B : <lb/>η B ≡ arg min <lb/>η <lb/>Γ (η). <lb/>(28) <lb/>If f is smooth enough at its maximum, then Γ (η B ) = 0: η B is the inflexion point of Γ. For <lb/>symmetric pdfs, η B = 1/2, but we do not restrict to this case. <lb/>As a consequence of the properties of Γ(η), we see from equation (25) that D (j; η) is strictly <lb/>positive for j &lt; j B , with <lb/>j B ≡ Γ (η B ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>f B <lb/>. <lb/>(29) <lb/>The value j B separates two regions where the model presents qualitatively different behav-<lb/>iors. When j &lt; j B , the function D(j; η) is strictly increasing from −∞ to +∞ as η goes from <lb/>0 to 1. As a result it is invertible: for any δ in ] − ∞, +∞[, equation (21) has a unique solution <lb/>η d (δ). <lb/>If j &gt; j B , there is a range of values of δ for which (21) has several solutions. <lb/>The existence of multiple solutions in the demand is thus a generic property of discrete choice <lb/>models with heterogeneous agents and social interactions (externalities). This is true whatever <lb/>the number of maxima of f , as shown in Section A.3 of Appendix A.

Under our hypothesis H1, Γ has a unique <lb/>minimum, and necessarily tends towards +∞ as η goes to either 0 or 1; Γ is strictly convex on <lb/>]η B , 1[, and strictly concave on ]0, η B [, hence the Legendre transform is well defined and unique <lb/>on each one of these intervals: equation (30) for j &gt; j B has indeed two solutions η L (j) and <lb/>η U (j), given by <lb/>j = Γ (η Λ ), Λ = U, L. <lb/>(32) <lb/>with <lb/>η L (j) &lt; η B &lt; η U (j). <lb/>(33) <lb/>From the knowledge of η U (j) and η L (j), using (21) one gets the marginal stability curves <lb/>δ U (j) and δ L (j), that is, the extreme values of δ bounding the region where multiple solutions <lb/>exist: <lb/>δ Λ (j) = D(j; η Λ (j)) = Γ(η Λ (j)) − jη Λ (j), Λ = U, L. <lb/>(34) <lb/>As already stated, for δ U (j) &lt; δ &lt; δ L (j), equation (21) has three solutions. The curve <lb/>η d (j; δ) has two stable branches (see figure 3): an upper one η d <lb/>U (j; δ) with η d <lb/>U (j; δ) &gt; η U (j) &gt; η B , <lb/>and a lower one η d <lb/>L (j; δ) with η d <lb/>L (j; δ) &lt; η L (j) &lt; η B ; they are joined by a branch of unstable <lb/>solutions -the above mentioned set of unstable equilibria (see figure 3)-. The upper branch <lb/>exists for δ ≥ δ U (j), the lower one for δ ≤ δ L (j). At the end points dη d <lb/>dδ | L,U = ∞. In other <lb/>words, solutions with large fractions of buyers, i.e. high-η solutions, only exist for δ ≥ δ U (j) <lb/>whereas low-η solutions exist only if δ ≤ δ L (j). Since δ U (j) ≤ δ L (j), the system has multiple <lb/>solutions for the demand η d whenever δ U (j) ≤ δ ≤ δ L (j). <lb/>For j = j B , these marginal stability curves merge at a single (degenerate) point δ L (j B ) = <lb/>δ U (j B ) = δ B with <lb/>δ B ≡ −Γ (η B ) η B + Γ(η B ) <lb/>(35) <lb/>This defines the bifurcation point B in the (j, δ) plane, <lb/>B ≡ {j B , δ B }. <lb/>(36) <lb/>One should note that η U,L (j) and δ U,L (j), which depend on j (and on the function Γ(.)), are <lb/>independent of h and p. <lb/>3.2.2 Generic properties <lb/>In fact, the preceding analysis can be made more general because the main results may be <lb/>obtained only based on the continuity and the convexity properties of Γ, without assuming any <lb/>smoothness properties of the derivatives of f . Let us consider this alternative. <lb/>First, whatever the smoothness properties of f , the demand η d must be a decreasing function <lb/>of the price: the economically acceptable values of the equilibrium demand, η d ∈ [0, 1], have <lb/>to increase when δ increases (p decreases). Thus, among the solutions of (21), the equilibria <lb/>lie on the branches where D (defined by equation (22)), is an increasing function of η (for <lb/>differentiable pdfs, this condition is given by equation (23) ). <lb/>Next, let us analyze D(j; η) as a function of η (see figure 2). By continuity of the function <lb/>Γ(η), D(j; η) is a continuous function of η ∈ [0, 1]. As η → 0, D → −∞, and as η → 1, <lb/>D → +∞. Since Γ is concave on ]0, η B ], on increasing η from 0 within [0, η B ], D(j, η) has <lb/>a maximum, δ L (j), on this interval. δ L (j) is by definition the Legendre transform of Γ(η) <lb/>restricted to ]0, η B ]. For η ≥ η B , Γ is convex, and thus D(j, η) has a minimum δ U (j) on [η B , 1], <lb/></body>

Beyond this minimum, D(j; η) <lb/>increases with η. <lb/>Now, for j &lt; j B , the maximum on [0, η B ] and the minimum on [η B , 1] of D(j; η) are both <lb/>reached at η B , hence D(j; η) increases monotonically as a function of η ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, <lb/>the solutions η d to equation (21) are unique monotonically increasing functions of δ for each j. <lb/>As a result, the inverse demand (24) is a uniquely defined continuously decreasing function of <lb/>η ∈ [0, 1]. <lb/>For j &gt; j B , the maximum δ L (j) is reached at η = η L (j) ∈]0, η B [.

No value of η within this interval can be a stable economic equilibrium. Hence, <lb/>for δ ranging between these extrema of D(j; η) the demand η d (j; δ) as a function of δ has two <lb/>branches, a lower one for δ ≤ δ L , with η d <lb/>L (j; δ) ≤ η L (j) &lt; η B and and an upper one for δ ≥ δ U , <lb/>with η d <lb/>U (j; δ) ≥ η U (j) &gt; η B . <lb/>In the case of a continuously differentiable function, the preceding results are recovered, <lb/>since the Legendre transforms -the above mentioned minimum and maximum of D(j; η) for <lb/>j &gt; j B -are reached at the values of η solutions of (30).

Inside the dashed region the demand presents multiple Nash <lb/>equilibria. Outside this region, the demand is a single valued function ofσ andδ. <lb/>p L (j, h) &lt; p U (j, h) given by <lb/>p Λ (j, h) = h − δ Λ (j), Λ = U, L. <lb/>(37) <lb/>By construction of the Legendre transforms, the branch δ = δ U (j) is concave, and the branch <lb/>δ = δ L (j) is convex. In addition, under the smoothness hypothesis, along each branch of the <lb/>multiple solutions region in the phase diagram: <lb/>dδ Λ (j) <lb/>dj <lb/>= <lb/>dD(j, η Λ (j)) <lb/>dj <lb/>= −η Λ (j), ; Λ ∈ {L, U }. <lb/>(38) <lb/>This property may be easily checked by deriving (34) with respect to j and making use of <lb/>(32). This means that the tangents to the boundaries have a slope given by the value of η <lb/>that is marginally stable on the corresponding boundary (i.e. by the η value of the solution <lb/>which appears/disappears as one crosses the boundary). Consequently, in the phase diagram, <lb/>the width along the δ-axis of the multiple solutions region increases with j as a result of the <lb/>convexity properties of the functions δ Λ (j), (Λ = L, U ). This may also be seen from (33), since <lb/>the slope of the L boundary (the one corresponding to η L ) is larger than that of the U boundary <lb/>(defined through η U ). At the bifurcation point B, these two boundaries merge, and, according <lb/>to (38), have a common slope −η B . <lb/>Referring back to figure 2, upon increasing δ from −∞, we have the following picture: if <lb/>j &lt; j B , the fraction η increases smoothly from 0 and reaches its upper value 1 for δ → ∞. <lb/>That is, to each value of the bare surplus δ, -or each value of the average willingness to adopt, <lb/>in non-market situations-corresponds a unique fraction of buyers/adopters. In the phase <lb/>diagram, figure 4, these solutions lie on the white region. On the other hand, if j &gt; j B , when δ <lb/>reaches the value δ U (j), a second, high-η solution appears besides the low-η one. These solutions <lb/>co-exist for δ U (j) ≤ δ ≤ δ L (j). The low-η solution disappears when δ increases beyond δ L (j), <lb/>leaving only the high-η solution. The parameter values for which there are multiple equilibria <lb/>is the grey region of the phase diagram, figure 4. Notice that in this region, there exists a third <lb/>solution that we neglected because it corresponds to the unstable situation where the demand <lb/>would increase with the price (or decrease with the bare surplus). <lb/></body>

			<body>As mentioned in Section 2.2, it is also useful to consider the same results in terms of the <lb/>parametersσ = σ/J andδ = (H − P )/J (see (12). The phase diagram in the plane (σ,δ) <lb/>is shown on figure 5. For large heterogeneity (σ/J larger thanσ B ≡ 1/j B ), there is a single <lb/>smooth solution. For weak enough heterogeneity (σ B &lt; 1/j B ), there is a domain with multiple <lb/>solutions. In the limitσ → 0, one recovers the simple results for a homogeneous population, as <lb/>briefly discussed Section 2.3. <lb/>3.2.4 Vicinity of the bifurcation point <lb/>The vicinity of the bifurcation point B in the phase diagram is of particular interest. Under the <lb/>smoothness assumption H2, we can study analytically its properties. Let us consider j = j B + <lb/>with 0 &lt; &lt;&lt; 1. Expanding (32) about j B , remembering that Γ (η B ) = 0, one gets, to the <lb/>lowest order in , the singular behavior <lb/>η d <lb/>L,U = η B ± <lb/>2 <lb/>Γ (η B ) <lb/>1/2 , <lb/>(39a) <lb/>δ L,U (j) = Γ(η B ) − η B j B − η B ∓ <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/>Γ (η B ) <lb/>3/2 . <lb/>(39b) <lb/>The above singular behaviors are typical examples of scaling properties which are universal: <lb/>the same scaling is obtained for any smooth distribution. From studies in statistical physics one <lb/>expects the exponents (e.g., here, 1/2 for the behavior of η) to depend mainly on the structure of <lb/>the network of interactions: the exponents would be different at the analogous critical point for <lb/>the model with agents situated on the vertices of a d-dimensional square lattice and interacting <lb/>only with their nearest neighbors. Typically the exponents depend on d up to some critical <lb/>dimension d c , above which they become identical to the &quot;mean-field&quot; exponents, which are <lb/>those obtained here with the global neighborhood. For the present model, other universal <lb/>scaling properties have been obtained, in relation with the hysteresis effects [80], and these <lb/>have been used in order to analyze empirical socio-economics data [65]. In a related work (with <lb/>a generalization of the model to more than two choices), Borghesi and Bouchaud [16] analyze <lb/>empirical data for which the social strength can be estimated, and is found to be close to the <lb/>critical value (the analogous of j B ). <lb/>In [44], where we consider the supply side, it will be seen that the bifurcation point B = <lb/>{j B , δ B } in the (j, δ) plane gives a singular point {j B , h B ≡ δ B } in the (j, h) plane which plays <lb/>an important role in the phase diagram associated to the optimal strategy for the monopolist. <lb/>3.2.5 Pareto optimality and coordination <lb/>Each one of the equilibria η d (j; δ) discussed in the preceding section is a Nash equilibrium for <lb/>the customers, at a posted price p. In this section we show that, whenever multiple solutions <lb/>exist, that is for j &gt; j B , the solution with the largest η is Pareto optimal. This is the solution <lb/>η d (j; δ) that satisfies η d (j; δ) ≥ η U (j). <lb/>Let us recall that if a customer i decides to buy, it is because his (normalized) surplus <lb/>s i = δ + jη + x i , <lb/>(40) <lb/>is positive. When s i &lt; 0 he doesn&apos;t buy and his surplus vanishes. Thus, his actual surplus is <lb/>w i = s i ω i (see Section 2). <lb/>Consider now the two equilibria η d (j; δ) in the region δ U (j) &lt; δ &lt; δ L (j) (see the curve <lb/>D(j; η) for j = 5 on figure 2). Let&apos;s denote by η d <lb/>L (j; δ) the low-η equilibrium (η d <lb/>L (j; δ) ≤ η L (j)), <lb/>and by η d <lb/>U (j; δ) the high-η equilibrium (η U (j) ≤ η d <lb/>U (j; δ)). In either equilibrium, the agents who <lb/></body>

Since η d <lb/>L (j; δ) &lt; η d <lb/>U (j; δ), agents with x i &lt; −δ − jη d <lb/>U (j) <lb/>are not buyers in any of the equilibria whereas agents with x i &gt; −δ − jη d <lb/>L (j) are buyers in <lb/>both equilibria. Those with −δ − jη d <lb/>U (j) &lt; x i &lt; −δ − jη d <lb/>L (j) are buyers only in the high-<lb/>η equilibrium, and their utility is thus larger (strictly positive instead of zero) in that case. <lb/>Moreover, even those agents that would buy in both cases have a larger surplus if the realized <lb/>equilibrium is the high-η one. Hence, in the high-η equilibrium all these agents have a larger <lb/>surplus than in the low-η one. This situation with two possible Nash equilibria, where the <lb/>strictly dominant one may be risk dominated, is reminiscent of coordination problems in game <lb/>theory. For a detailed analysis of this analogy see Phan and Semeshenko [74]. The present <lb/>analysis shows that coordination problems may arise in systems with heterogeneous agents <lb/>whenever the externalities are strong enough. <lb/>Whether a Nash equilibrium -and which one in the case of multiple equilibria-is actually <lb/>realized depends on the rationality of the agents and the information they have access to. <lb/>In the context of bounded rationality and of repeated choices, a natural hypothesis is that <lb/>agents estimate what will be the fraction of adopters, and may base their estimate on previous <lb/>observations. In this paper we will not discuss these issues, that we are currently analyzing. <lb/>Some partial results (dynamics with myopic agents and with various reinforcement learning <lb/>paradigms) are discussed elsewhere [45, 79]. <lb/>3.3 Summary of the generic customers&apos; model <lb/>To summarize this section, if the social influence is small enough to satisfy the condition j &lt; j B , <lb/>at each value of the bare surplus δ = h − p, which measures the gap between the population <lb/>average willingness to pay and the price, there is a unique solution η d (j; δ) to equation (21). <lb/>This demand is a monotonic increasing function of δ. However, if the social influence is large <lb/>enough (j &gt; j B ), there is a range of values δ U (j) ≤ δ ≤ δ L (j) for which two different (stable) <lb/>solutions exist, a high demand one (η d (j; δ) ≥ η U (j) &gt; η B ) and a low demand one (η d (j; δ) ≤ <lb/>η L (j) &lt; η B ). In this region, the customers are faced with a coordination problem. If δ is <lb/></body>

			<body>modified dynamically within this range, the demand may jump abruptly between these two <lb/>solutions, a situation analogous to so called first order phase transitions in physics. Outside <lb/>the range [δ U (j), δ L (j)], there is a single solution, like in the small j case. <lb/>We showed that the threshold j B , which corresponds to the onset of a bifurcation in the <lb/>customers phase diagram, is determined by the maximum f B of the IWP pdf: j B = 1/f B . <lb/>Although most of the analysis has been done for smooth pdfs, we have shown that the generic <lb/>behavior stems only from convexity properties of the function Γ(η), that is from the fact that <lb/>the pdf f (x) is strictly increasing for x &lt; x B and strictly decreasing for x &gt; x B , where x B is <lb/>the mode of f . <lb/>Some specific properties which arise for distributions with compact support are discussed in <lb/>appendix A.1, and the case of distributions with infinite variance is studied in appendix A.2. <lb/>In appendix A.3 we extend the results of this section to multimodal distributions. <lb/>In market contexts (and in particular for the market analysis of [44]), it is useful to consider <lb/>the inverse demand p d instead of δ, as in standard approaches. In figure 6 we plot the values <lb/>of δ = p − h as a function of the demand η and the strength j of the social externality for the <lb/>case of a logistic distribution. <lb/>4 Conclusion and perspectives <lb/>The model of collective behavior considered in this paper, under the general hypothesis detailed <lb/>in Section 2, may be declined in both non-economic and economic contexts. In the first case, <lb/>one is interested in the fraction of adopters, which corresponds to studying the demand function <lb/>for an exogenous price in the second case. <lb/>Like in many other models in the recent literature, we consider optimizing agents making <lb/>binary choices, with willingnesses to adopt that depend additively on an idiosyncratic part <lb/>(IWP) and on the choices of other agents. The population is intrinsically heterogeneous: the <lb/>IWPs are drawn from some distribution of mean H and variance σ 2 . In contrast with other <lb/>most studied models, here the idiosyncratic willingness-to-adopt heterogeneity is frozen: it <lb/>does not result from (time varying) random shocks. In other words, each agent&apos;s choice is <lb/>deterministic with a well known (to him) IWP, and we concentrate on the aggregate behaviors. <lb/>We analyze the equilibrium properties (Nash equilibria) characterized by the emergence of a <lb/>collective behavior resulting from the combined effect of externalities and heterogeneity. <lb/>Our results, for global uniform interactions -a global social influence of uniform strength-<lb/>in the limit of an infinite population -through the application of the central limit theorem-<lb/>are summarized on phase diagrams. The axes of a phase diagram are the relevant model <lb/>parameters. In the case of the demand, the parameters are: δ, the bare surplus (that is, in <lb/>the economic context, the gap between the average IWP and the posted price), and j, the <lb/>social influence strength, both parameters being measured in units of the standard deviation <lb/>σ of the idiosyncratic term distribution (see 2.2). In this space of parameters, one draws <lb/>the boundaries between regions (&quot;phases&quot;) of qualitatively different collective behaviors. The <lb/>boundaries, where &quot;phase transitions&quot; occur, are lines of non-analyticity (e.g. the demand is <lb/>discontinuous on the boundary). In our problem, the main feature characterizing a given region <lb/>is the number of equilibria in this region. <lb/>From a constructivist point of view, our model encompasses the classical downward sloping <lb/>demand curve as a particular case. Indeed, one of the main results for the demand is that, for <lb/>very general IWP distributions, there is a region in the phase diagram with multiple equilibria. <lb/>More precisely, if the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there are two Nash equilibria for any j <lb/>larger than a distribution-dependent value j B . For smaller values of j, the (Marshallian) demand <lb/>curves are, ceteris paribus, downward sloping (i.e. monotonically decreasing with increasing <lb/>prices). For large externality strengths (j &gt; j B ), when the population average willingness to <lb/></body>

			<body>pay is small enough, the demand becomes not-monotonic (as in Becker&apos;s example [9]). This is <lb/>a very general property of the model with additive externalities, and does not depend on the <lb/>particular statistical distribution of the idiosyncratic preferences. We also discuss (although <lb/>more briefly) the results for multimodal distributions -for which there exist several regions <lb/>with multiple equilibria, with possibly more than two equlibria for some of them-, and present <lb/>detailed analysis of many illustrative examples. <lb/>An important contribution of this paper is to exhibit the detailed properties of the bound-<lb/>aries of the regions (in the parameters space) where multiple solutions exist. These properties <lb/>are generic, in that they depend only on qualitative features of the IWP distribution. <lb/>Future work may extend the results presented in this paper in several directions. First, the <lb/>individual preferences may include a stochastic (noise) term like in [36, 33, 94, 19, 13, 14, 67, 4], <lb/>on top of the idiosyncratic one. Second, the present paper concentrates on the equilibrium <lb/>properties -that may be considered as the &quot;static&quot; analysis of long term equilibria in the <lb/>Marshallian tradition. Further studies should focus on the process that makes the system <lb/>reach one or the other of the possible equilibria. A first study, implying revision of beliefs <lb/>in an repeated choice setting, has already been published [79]: in the region with multiple <lb/>equilibria, interesting complex dynamics occur with a large family of different equilibria being <lb/>reached, depending on the particular learning rule used by the agents. Third, literature on <lb/>marketing and studies of social psychology shows that choices very often depend on imitation <lb/>effects or social influence. For example, the existence of externalities in the Communication <lb/>and Information Technologies (CIT) sector is well established, and may result in a multiplicity <lb/>of equilibria [76]. This may arise in other sectors also. Yet, empirical and econometric studies <lb/>allowing identification of the corresponding preferences distributions and the strength of the <lb/>social influence are lacking [15]. Fourth, the influence of social networks topologies deserves <lb/>further attention. Ioannides [50] reported results for the &quot;Thurnstone model, i.e. homogeneous <lb/>IWP and stochastic (logistic) choices, mainly for tree-like and one-dimensional networks with <lb/>nearest-neighbor interactions. It would be interesting to explore how the phase diagrams for <lb/>the model considered here -heterogeneous IWPs and deterministic choices-are affected by <lb/>short range interactions. Analytical and simulation studies on the RFIM [80, 73] show that <lb/>the heterogeneity introduces hysteretic effects in the dynamics, with interesting path-dependant <lb/>properties (return-point memory effect [80]). A statistical method to calculate the return points <lb/>exactly, starting from an arbitrary initial state, has been recently proposed [82] for the simple <lb/>case of a one dimensional periodic network with nearest-neighbor interactions (called cyclic <lb/>topology in [50]). The impact of such properties on both individual and collective economic <lb/>behavior remains to be investigated. <lb/>In a companion paper [44], we will discuss within the market context the profit optimization <lb/>by a monopolist fixing the price. Other extensions of the results of this second part involve the <lb/>study of how, with repeated choices, the long term equilibria depend on the entangled dynamics <lb/>where customers and monopolist learn from each other. Finally, at least two directions are <lb/>worth to be explored: the case of an oligopolistic competition and the consequences of Coase <lb/>conjecture in the case of choices with externalities involving a durable good -an issue already <lb/>addressed in the literature [61], but not yet in the regime where multiple equilibria exist. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">A Appendix: Demand for other distributions <lb/>In this Appendix we extend our analysis to more general distributions. <lb/>We first (A.1) explicit the particularities introduced on the above generic results when the <lb/>pdf has a bounded support. In Section A.2 we relax hypothesis H5, and consider pdfs with <lb/>unbounded support called fat tail distributions in the literature. Finally, we extend our results <lb/>to multimodal distributions in Section A.3. <lb/>A.1 Pdfs with compact support <lb/>We consider here pdfs f (x) with compact supports: x ∈ [x m , x M ] presenting a unique maxi-<lb/>mum (which may be located at one boundary). Clearly, such pdfs have finite variances. The <lb/>discussion follows the same lines as that of the generic smooth distributions, except that in <lb/>addition one has to pay attention to the values of Γ and its derivatives at the boundaries η = 0, <lb/>η = 1. A simple uniform distribution, analyzed in [45], is a particular case where the maximum <lb/>of the pdf is degenerate. <lb/>In this section, derivatives like Γ (1) or Γ (0), stand for the left and the right derivative of <lb/>Γ at η = 1 and η = 0, respectively. Due to the fact that the pdf strictly vanishes beyond its <lb/>support, if the price is very high with respect to h (small δ) there may be no buyers at all, <lb/>and η = 0. On the contrary, if the price is very low (large δ) the market may or not saturate, <lb/>i.e. η = 1, depending on the behaviour of the pdf in the vicinity of x m . We represent the <lb/>lines delimiting the regions where these solutions exist on the phase diagram. It should be <lb/>stressed that these lines only indicate saturation and non-existence of a market. Their nature <lb/>is different from that of the boundaries δ L and δ U . In the following we consider a triangular <lb/>distribution with a maximum f B at x B to illustrate our general results. The figures in this <lb/>section correspond to x B = −1, i.e. a case where the maximum lies inside the support. The <lb/>case x B = x m has been considered in the study of the learning dynamics [79]. <lb/>In the case of compact supports [x m , x M ], Γ(η) increases from Γ(0) = −x M &lt; 0, to Γ(1) = <lb/>−x m &gt; 0. Like in the generic case of unbounded supports, Γ reaches a minimum at η B , and <lb/>there is a critical value j B = 1/f B beyond which multiple solutions appear. Notice that if <lb/>the maximum of the pdf lies at x m or at x M , η B lies at one of the boundaries of the [0, 1] <lb/>interval. As already shown in Section 3.1, if the pdf is symmetric -as is the case for the <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">uniform distribution-, η B = 1/2. <lb/>In our example of a triangular pdf with maximum at x B we have: <lb/>f (x) = <lb/>2(x−xm) <lb/>(xM −xm)(xB −xm) <lb/>if x m ≤ x ≤ x B , <lb/>2(xM −x) <lb/>(xM −xm)(xM −xB ) <lb/>if x B ≤ x ≤ x M , <lb/>(A-1) <lb/>with f (x) = 0 outside the support. At its maximum, f B = 2/(x M − x m ). The constraint of <lb/>zero mean and unit variance imposes a relationship between the support boundaries and the <lb/>value of x B : x m = (−x B − 3(8 − x 2 <lb/>B ))/2, x M = (−x B + 3(8 − x 2 <lb/>B ))/2. <lb/>If x B = x M the distribution increases monotonically from 0 at x m , reaching its maximum <lb/>at x M , and is defined only by the first equation in (A-1). Conversely, if x B = x m then f (x) <lb/>decreases inside its support, and is defined by the second equation in (A-1). In both cases, f (x) <lb/>presents a discontinuity at one boundary of its support. <lb/>The function Γ and its first derivative for the triangular distribution are respectively <lb/>Γ(η) = <lb/>−x M + (x M − x m )(x M − x B )η <lb/>if 0 ≤ η ≤ η B <lb/>−x m − (x M − x m )(x B − x m )(1 − η) if η B ≤ η ≤ 1 <lb/>(A-2) <lb/>and <lb/>Γ (η) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>√ <lb/>(xM −xm)(xM −xB ) <lb/>2 <lb/>√ <lb/>η <lb/>if 0 ≤ η ≤ η B <lb/>√ <lb/>(xM −xm)(xB−xm) <lb/>2 <lb/>√ <lb/>(1−η) <lb/>if η B ≤ η ≤ 1 <lb/>(A-3) <lb/>where η B = (x M − x B )/(x M − x m ) is the inflexion point of Γ. They are represented on figure 7 <lb/>(left) for the particular value x B = −1. Notice that Γ (η) is discontinuous at η B , because the <lb/>maximum of f (x) is a cusp. <lb/>The corresponding inverse demand function D(j; η) (equation (22 ) ) is represented on figure <lb/>7 (right). Due to the finite range of the compact support, there are two new particular values <lb/>of δ: δ 0 ≡ D(j; 0) = Γ(0) = −x M , independent of j, and δ 1 (j) ≡ D(j; 1) = Γ(1) − j = −x m − j: <lb/>for δ &lt; δ 0 , η = 0 (no-market) is a solution, while for δ &gt; δ 1 (j) there is a solution η = 1 (market <lb/>saturation). These extreme values of η may be reached upon finite values of δ (i.e. finite prices <lb/>and finite average IWP) only in the case of compact supports. <lb/>For j &lt; j B , D(j; η) is strictly increasing and invertible on ]0, 1[: for any δ in ]−x M , −x m −j[, <lb/>equation (21) has a unique solution η d (δ) = {0, 1}. One can easily check that j &lt; j B implies <lb/>j ≤ x M − x m , so that −x M &lt; −x m − j and consequently D(j; 0) &lt; D(j; 1). In the particular <lb/>case where f is the uniform distribution, one has precisely j B = x M − x m . For the triangular <lb/>pdf (A-1), (29) gives j B = (x M − x m )/2, the support&apos;s half-width. Thus, for δ 0 &lt; δ &lt; δ 1 (j) the <lb/>fraction of buyers/adopters is a monotonic increasing function of δ. For δ &lt; δ 0 , η = 0, and for <lb/>δ &gt; δ 1 (j) the market saturates (η = 1). <lb/>For j &gt; j B there are two stable solutions whenever δ U (j) ≤ δ ≤ δ L (j). Due to the existence <lb/>of the extreme solutions η = 0 and η = 1, the analysis is more cumbersome than for infinite <lb/>supports. If the maximum of the pdf lies inside the support, the solutions η L (j) and η U (j) <lb/>of equation (30) lie in ]0, 1[ and δ U (j) and δ L (j) both satisfy D = 0. On increasing δ from <lb/>−∞, there is no demand until δ = min{δ 0 , δ U (j)}. If δ 0 &lt; δ U (j), when δ increases beyond δ 0 <lb/>the demand becomes finite and remains unique provided that δ 0 &lt; δ &lt; δ U (j). For δ &gt; δ U (j) <lb/>we enter the region of multiple solutions. On the other hand, if δ 0 &gt; δ U (j), the system steps <lb/>directly from the no-demand solution into a region where a finite demand equilibrium with <lb/>η &gt; η B coexists with the no-demand one. Notice that the high-η solution may correspond <lb/>to either a fraction of buyers strictly smaller than 1 (if δ L (j) &lt; δ 1 (j)) or to saturation (if <lb/>δ L (j) &gt; δ 1 (j)). In the case of the triangular distribution it is straightforward to check that the <lb/>multiple solutions region sets in at j B = (x M − x m )/2, δ B = x B /2. <lb/></div>

More precisely, if x B = x m then η U = η B = 1, if x B = x M , η L = η B = 0. <lb/>Summarizing, the customers phase diagram for pdfs with compact supports have two sup-<lb/>plementary lines with respect to that with unbounded supports. They indicate the boundary of <lb/>the viability region (no market exists below this line) and the saturation boundary (above which <lb/>all the customers are buyers). Figure 8 presents the customers&apos; phase diagram for our example <lb/>corresponding to the triangular pdf of unitary variance (A-1), with a maximum at x B = −1. <lb/>A.2 Pdfs with fat tails <lb/>Fat-tail distributions are characterized by the fact that the pdf f has a slow decrease at large <lb/>values of x, so that the variance is infinite -or even the mean is infinite. Equivalently this <lb/>occurs if Γ(η) diverges &apos;too fast&apos; to −∞ when η → 0. In the case of the logistic, Γ ∼ log η; for <lb/>the Gaussian, Γ ∼ − <lb/>√ <lb/>−2 log η; for a power law, Γ ∼ − 1 <lb/>η b . This suggest to consider the general <lb/>following smooth behavior: <lb/>as η → 0: Γ(η) ∼ −K(− log η) a 1 <lb/>η b , <lb/>(A-4) <lb/>with the constant K &gt; 0, a ≥ 0 and b ≥ 0 (ab = 0). The fat-tail case corresponds then to a = 0 <lb/>and b ≥ 1 in the above equation (A-4). <lb/>A particular example of a fat tail distribution is a pdf with a power law decrease, which for <lb/>large x behaves like: <lb/>f (x) ∼ x −(1+µ) <lb/>(A-5) <lb/>with µ ≥ 0. Then, for small η, Γ ∼ − 1 <lb/>η b with b = 1/µ, so that b ≥ 1 means µ ≤ 1. For µ &lt; 1, <lb/>not only the variance but also the mean value of the random variable x is infinite. <lb/>For fat-tails distributions one has to look at finite size effects: it is no more possible to <lb/>take directly the large N limit and make use of the central limit theorem: quantities like <lb/>(1/N ) i G(x i ) for any function G will be dominated by rare events, that is by the largest <lb/></div>

The discussion Section 3.2, based on convexity <lb/>arguments, can be extended to describe the phase diagram for the aggregate demand in the <lb/>multimodal case. <lb/>The minimal hypotheses we consider are the following. <lb/>• HA0. The pdf f (x) is continuous with a finite number K ≥ 2 of x-values, −∞ &lt; x K <lb/>B &lt; <lb/>x K−1 <lb/>B <lb/>&lt; ... &lt; x 1 <lb/>B &lt; ∞, for which f has a (possibly local) bounded maximum, <lb/>f (x k <lb/>B ) &lt; ∞ k = 1, ..., K. <lb/>(A-9) <lb/>For simplicity we assume also that the pdf is not constant on any interval of finite length. <lb/>Actually, the discussion can be easily extended to less regular pdfs (in particular piecewise <lb/>continuous pdfs), and pdfs constant on some intervals, but to keep the discussion shorter <lb/>will leave that to the interested reader (in the case of a monomodal pdf, see the discussion <lb/>on compact supports, and for the bimodal case see also below, Section A.3.2, the singular <lb/>case of a distribution composed of two Diracs). <lb/>• HA1. When considering smoother functions, we will assume f to be twice continuously <lb/>differentiable, so that in particular it has a zero derivative at every maximum and every <lb/>minimum. <lb/>Let us denote by x k <lb/>C the location of the minimum between x k+1 <lb/>B <lb/>and x k <lb/>B . We assume f &gt; 0 <lb/>everywhere on its support except possibly at some minima, and f (x) goes to zero as x → ±∞. <lb/>By convention we set x 0 <lb/>C = +∞ and x K <lb/>C = −∞ (and we may write f (x 0 <lb/>C ) = f (x K <lb/>C ) = 0). <lb/>In the monomodal case, we have seen that the critical value of j for the appearance of several <lb/>solutions is j B = 1/f (x B ).

The ensemble of equilibria δ d (η) for <lb/>η ∈ [0, 1] is the subset of the ensemble of solutions of (21) for which δ increases (p decreases) <lb/>as η increases. As for the monomodal case we study the function of η defined by (21) for <lb/>any given j, δ(η) = D(j; η). By continuity of the function Γ, δ(η) is a continuous function of <lb/>η ∈ [0, 1]. As η → 0, δ → −∞, and as η → 1, δ → +∞. Increasing η from 0, δ(η) increases. <lb/>Similarly, decreasing η from η = 1, δ(η) decreases. Since f (x) is continuous, Γ(η) is continuously <lb/>differentiable, with Γ (η) ≡ dΓ(η)/dη = 1/f (x) at x = −Γ(η). Hence Γ (η) has (local) minima <lb/>at values of η given by <lb/>Γ (η k <lb/>B ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>f (x k <lb/>B ) <lb/>k = 1, ..., K <lb/>(A-12) <lb/>and (local) maxima at values of η given by <lb/>Γ (η k <lb/>C ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>f (x k <lb/>C ) <lb/>k = 1, ..., K − 1 <lb/>(A-13) <lb/>For a smooth enough pdf, the η k <lb/>B and η k <lb/>C s are inflexion points for Γ. Note that for any k = <lb/>1, ..., K, η k−1 <lb/>C <lb/>&lt; η k <lb/>B &lt; η k <lb/>C . <lb/>The most important remark is that Γ(η) is strictly concave on every interval ]η k−1 <lb/>C , η k <lb/>B [, k = <lb/>1, ..., K, and strictly convex on every interval ]η k <lb/>B , η k <lb/>C [, k = 1, ..., K. Then as η varies on <lb/>[η k−1 <lb/>C , η k <lb/>B ], the function D(j, η) = Γ(η) − jη has, at some value η k <lb/>L (j), a maximum δ k <lb/>L (j) which <lb/>is by definition the Legendre transform of Γ(η) restricted to [η k−1 <lb/>C , η k <lb/>B ]. Similarly, on [η k <lb/>B , η k <lb/>C ], <lb/>D(j, η) has, at some value η k <lb/>U (j), a minimum δ k <lb/>U (j), the Legendre transform of Γ(η) restricted <lb/>to [η k <lb/>B , η k <lb/>C ]. <lb/>Depending on the value of j compared to the values j k <lb/>B , j k <lb/>C , these min and max may be <lb/>reached either at a boundary of an interval, or in the interior. More precisely: <lb/>j &lt; j k <lb/>B , η k <lb/>L = η k <lb/>U = η k <lb/>B <lb/>(A-14) <lb/>j k <lb/>B &lt; j &lt; j k <lb/>C , η k <lb/>B &lt; η k <lb/>U &lt; η k <lb/>C <lb/>(A-15) <lb/>j k <lb/>B &lt; j &lt; j k−1 <lb/>C , η k−1 <lb/>C <lb/>&lt; η k <lb/>L &lt; η k <lb/>B <lb/>(A-16) <lb/>j k <lb/>C &lt; j, η k+1 <lb/>L <lb/>= η k <lb/>U = η k <lb/>C <lb/>(A-17) <lb/>(and η k <lb/>U increases from η k <lb/>B to η k <lb/>C as j increases from j k <lb/>B to j k <lb/>C , whereas η k <lb/>L decreases from η k <lb/>B <lb/>to η k−1 <lb/>C <lb/>as j increases from j k <lb/>B to j k−1 <lb/>C ). In the case of a continuously differentiable pdf, every <lb/>Legendre transform η k <lb/>Λ (j), Λ = L, U satisfies the marginal stability equation, <lb/>∂D(j, η) <lb/>∂η <lb/>| η=η k <lb/>Λ (j) = 0. <lb/>(A-18) <lb/>One should note that η k <lb/>U,L and δ k <lb/>U,L depend on j (and on the function Γ(.)), but not on h or p. <lb/>Now for j &lt; j B ≡ min k j k <lb/>B , every min and max are reached at the corresponding value η k <lb/>B : <lb/>this means that there is no intermediate regime with a decreasing behavior of δ(η) as η increases, <lb/>hence δ d (η) = D(j, η), uniquely defined, is a continuously increasing function of η ∈ [0, 1]. For <lb/>j &gt; j B , there is at least one k where the maximum δ k <lb/>L (j) is reached for η = η k <lb/>L (j) &lt; η k <lb/>B , and <lb/>the minimum δ k <lb/>U (j) is reached for η = η k <lb/>U (j) &gt; η k <lb/>B , so that there is at least one finite interval of <lb/>η on which the function D(j, η) decreases with η, and thus does not correspond to an economic <lb/>equilibrium. Hence the demand η d (δ) has at least two branches. <lb/></div>
