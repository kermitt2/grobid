        <body>The existence of a pseudogap in electronic excitation spectra of high-T c <lb/>superconductors (HTSC), which appears below a certain temperature T* &gt; T c , <lb/>is considered to be amongst the most important features of cuprates. Many <lb/>experiments have provided evidence (NMR [1], angle-resolved photoemission <lb/>(ARPES) [2], specific heat [3], electron-tunneling spectroscopy [4] and STM [5]) <lb/>for a gap-like structure in electronic excitation spectra. There is a consensus on <lb/>that the pseudogap is a characteristic feature of the underdoped regime of <lb/>copper-oxides, and the value of T* increases with the decrease of hole <lb/>concentration. For example, in tunneling measurements on underdoped Bi2212 <lb/>single crystals by STM, the pseudogap was detected even at room temperature <lb/>[5]. At the same time, tunneling measurements showed that the pseudogap is also <lb/>present in slightly overdoped samples as well [4]. An advantage of tunneling <lb/>spectroscopy is that it is particularly sensitive to the density of state (DOS) near <lb/>the Fermi level E F and, thus, is capable of detecting any gap in the quasiparticle <lb/>excitation spectrum at E F [6]. In addition to this, tunneling spectroscopy has a <lb/>high energy resolution [6]. <lb/>In general, the pseudogap in cuprates can originate from the charge-density-<lb/>wave (CDW) order, the spin-density-wave (SDW) order due to local <lb/>antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations, the presence of incoherent Cooper pairs, <lb/>or from their combination (so-called Ansatz) [7]. From earlier studies, the <lb/>pseudogap was associated with a SDW gap due to local AF correlations [1]. <lb/>Very recent measurements of high-frequency conductivity that track the phase-<lb/>correlation time in the normal state of underdoped Bi2212 showed that the <lb/>incoherent Cooper pairs remain up to T pair which is well above T c , however, <lb/>lower than T* [8]. Thus, between T c and T pair , there is a contribution of <lb/>incoherent Cooper pairs to the pseudogap. Indeed, there is a consensus on that, <lb/>to the contrary to conventional SCs, the formation of the Copper pairs and the <lb/>establishment of the phase coherence among them in cuprates occur at different <lb/>temperatures, T pair &gt; T c [9,8,5]. So, it is reasonable to expect that the incoherent <lb/>Cooper pairs have to be observed above T c in different types of measurements <lb/>including tunneling. The T pair scales with T*, thus, the difference between T pair <lb/>and T c is the highest in the underdoped regime and becomes smaller in the <lb/>overdoped regime [9]. <lb/>We present here direct measurements of the density of states by electron-<lb/>tunneling spectroscopy on slightly overdoped Bi2212 single crystals using a <lb/>break-junction technique. The pseudogap which has been detected above T c <lb/>appears at T* ≈ 280 K. The analysis of the spectra shows that there is a <lb/>contribution to the pseudogap above T c , which disappears between T c and T*. <lb/>We associate this contribution to the pseudogap with the presence of incoherent <lb/>Cooper pairs in Bi2212. To our knowledge, the data shown in Fig. 2 are the <lb/>most detailed tunneling data of the pseudogap presented in the literature. <lb/>The single crystals of Bi2212 were grown using a self-flux method and then <lb/>mechanically separated from the flux in Al 2 O 3 or ZrO 2 crucibles [10]. The <lb/>dimensions of the samples are typically 3×1×0.1 mm 3 . The chemical <lb/>composition of the Bi2212 phase corresponds to the formula <lb/>Bi 2 Sr 1.9 CaCu 1.8 O 8+x as measured by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence <lb/>(EDAX). The crystallographic a, b, c values of the overdoped single crystals <lb/>are of 5.41 Å, 5.50 Å and 30.81 Å, respectively. The T c value was determined <lb/>by either dc-magnetization or by four-contacts method yielding T c = 87 -90 K <lb/>with the transition width ∆T c ~ 1 K. The single crystals were checked out to <lb/>assure that they are in the overdoped phase. <lb/>Experimental details of our break-junction technique can be found elsewhere <lb/>[11]. Shortly, many break-junctions were prepared by gluing a sample with <lb/>epoxy on a flexible insulating substrate and then were broken by bending the <lb/>substrate with a differential screw at 14 -18 K in a helium atmosphere. The <lb/>electrical contacts were made by attaching gold wires to a crystal with silver <lb/>paint. The sample resistance (with the contacts), R sample , at room temperature <lb/>varied from 5 Ω to about 1 kΩ, depending on the sample. The I(V) and <lb/>dI/dV(V) tunneling characteristics were determined by the four-terminal <lb/>method using a standard lock-in modulation technique. The tunneling spectra of <lb/>our break junctions on Bi2212 single crystals exhibit below T c the characteristic <lb/>features of typical tunneling spectra in Bi2212 [12,5,4]. <lb/>Figure 1 shows a set of normalized tunneling conductance curves measured <lb/>in superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) between 14 K and 290 K on <lb/>an overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88.5 K. All curves, except the last <lb/>one, show a gaplike structure. In the absence of generally accepted model for <lb/>the pseudogap, we consider the presence of the gap-like features in tunneling <lb/>spectra as a sign of the pseudogap (for more details, see Ref. 5). There is no <lb/>sign indicating at what temperature the superconducting gap was closed. Across <lb/>T c , the superconducting tunneling spectra evolve continuously into a normal-<lb/>state quasiparticle-gap structure which vanishes at 232 K &lt; T * &lt; 290 K but <lb/>remains almost unchanged with temperature up to 232 K [13]. Such evolution of <lb/>superconducting spectra into normal-state spectra across T c has been also <lb/>observed in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions [5]. Thus, it <lb/>is clear that the pseudogap is related somehow to the superconductivity [5]. The <lb/>spectra in Fig. 1 show the change in conductance from very low to high <lb/>temperatures. It is difficult in such scale to see the differences between spectra <lb/>above T c . Therefore, Figure 2 shows tunneling spectra only above T c , measured <lb/>on another overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88 K. In Fig. 2, one can <lb/>see that there is a gap-like structure just above T c which disappears at some <lb/>temperature T 0 much lower than T*. Most pseudogap data observed in our <lb/>study look similar to the data presented in Fig. 1, however, measurements on <lb/>the best samples [14] show some gap-like features in tunneling spectra above T c , <lb/>which look similar to the gap-like structure shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, we <lb/>believe that these features reflect intrinsic properties of overdoped Bi2212. <lb/>The spectra shown in Fig. 2 are asymmetrical about zero bias. Such behavior <lb/>is typical for tunneling spectra obtained on the nonmetallic surfaces [15]. In <lb/>fact, the contribution of the Cooper pairs to the pseudogap must not depend on <lb/>the direction of bias. Thus, it is more convenient to consider only an even part <lb/>of the conductivity, G e (V) ≡ [G(V) + G(-V)]/2 [16]. Figure 3 shows the even <lb/>part of the tunneling spectra presented in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, one can clearly <lb/>observe two humps at different temperatures, one of them disappears at T 0 &gt; <lb/>100 K, and the second one is traceable up to high temperatures. It is difficult to <lb/>indicate exactly the origins of these humps, especially, the wide ones which are <lb/>traceable to high temperatures. However, we will try just to determine <lb/>characteristic temperatures from temperature dependencies of these humps, <lb/>which are shown in Fig. 4. We use straight (dash) line in Fig. 4 in order to <lb/>estimate the value of T 0 which is of the order of 110 -115 K. The origin of this <lb/>hump we discuss further. We concentrate now on the behavior of the curve with <lb/>dots in Fig. 4, which correspond to the temperature dependence of wide humps. <lb/>The fall of this curve with the increase of temperature between T c and T 0 <lb/>supports an idea that there are some changes in the system. The indication of <lb/>some changes which begin at ~ 210 K with the increase of temperature can be <lb/>explained by the disappearance of local AF correlations [17]. It seems that, <lb/>between T 0 and 210 K, there is no principal changes in the system. From Figs. <lb/>1, 2 and 3, the value of T * is of the order of 280 K. In Fig. 3, in addition to the <lb/>two humps which have been discussed above, one can observe also a hump at 70 <lb/>mV between 103 K and 122 K [18]. <lb/>We discuss now the origin of the contribution to the pseudogap, which <lb/>disappears at T 0 with the increase of temperature. This contribution can be <lb/>explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or <lb/>incoherent Cooper pairs. From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is <lb/>likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear. Consequently, it is most <lb/>likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs <lb/>[8,9,5]. Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the <lb/>order parameter. Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of <lb/>preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the <lb/>average value of binding energy per particle [9]. However, our results alone <lb/>cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs. We can <lb/>argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements [8] showed that the <lb/>incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted <lb/>by the theory [17,19]. It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling <lb/>between Stripes) model proposed very recently [20,21]. There is also an <lb/>alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, <lb/>it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 <lb/>phase with T c = 110 K [22]. Even in this case, our data obtained in SIS <lb/>junctions support in general the conclusions made on the basis of tunneling <lb/>data in SIN junctions, namely, that the pseudogap is directly related to <lb/>superconductivity [5]. <lb/>Recently, the pseudogap has been observed in Bi2212 with T c = 90 K <lb/>(optimum doping) and T c = 84 K (slightly overdoped) by SIN tunneling <lb/>technique [23]. The measured value of T* is equal to 300 K and 270 K, <lb/>respectively. Thus, the value of T* ≈ 280 K found in our measurements for <lb/>slightly overdoped single crystals is in an excellent agreement with the SIN <lb/>tunneling measurements [23]. In slightly overdoped Bi2212, the pseudogap has <lb/>been also observed in SIS tunneling measurements performed by break-<lb/>junction technique [24]. The value of T* is found to be of the order of 190 K. <lb/>However, the analysis of SIS spectra presented in Ref. 24 (see Fig. 4) shows <lb/>that, in fact, the T* value is of the order of 290 -300 K. In the literature, <lb/>there is a clear discrepancy in the definition of T*. For slightly overdoped <lb/>Bi2212, the temperature 270 -300 K corresponds most likely to the charge <lb/>ordering, T* charge ≈ 270 -300 K [17]. The temperature T* ≈ 190 K found in <lb/>Ref. 24 and the changes which were observed at ~ 210 K in our study (see Fig. <lb/>4) correspond most likely to the spin ordering, T* spin ≈ 190 -210 K [17]. <lb/>Thus, there is a very good agreement among tunneling data presented in Refs. <lb/>23, 24 and the present work. What is interesting, in SIS tunneling <lb/>measurements, the value of 116 K has been also discussed and assumed to be <lb/>the local onset of superconductivity [24]. <lb/>In summary, we presented direct measurements of the density-of-state by <lb/>tunneling spectroscopy on slightly overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8-x single crystals <lb/>in a temperature range between 14 K and 290 K using the break-junction <lb/>technique. The pseudogap which has been detected above T c appears at T* ≈ <lb/>280 K. The fine analysis of the spectra shows that there is a contribution to the <lb/>pseudogap above T c . We associate this contribution with the presence of <lb/>incoherent Cooper pairs in Bi2212, which disappears approximately at 110 -<lb/>115 K. However, alternative explanations for the presence of this contribution <lb/>are also possible. In all cases, there is no doubts that the pseudogap observed <lb/>in our study is partially or entirely related to the superconductivity.<lb/></body>
