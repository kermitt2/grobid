			<body>Introduction <lb/>Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects 350 to <lb/>400 million individuals worldwide and is the leading cause of liver <lb/>cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide [1]. Although <lb/>much is known about HBV structure and replicative cycle [2] the <lb/>pathogenic mechanisms responsible for liver injury, cirrhosis <lb/>development and malignant transformation during chronic HBV <lb/>infection are not well understood. It is believed that these events <lb/>originate from persistent immune pathogenesis [3], but observa-<lb/>tions in transgenic mouse models of HBV infection suggest that in <lb/>absence of an adaptive immune responses cellular mechanisms <lb/>induced by HBV proteins may also lead to the development of <lb/>these liver diseases [4,5]. <lb/>The HBV transgenic mice used in the current study contain a <lb/>sub-genomic HBV DNA fragment (genotype D, subtype ayw) <lb/>encoding the three co-carboxyterminal HBV surface (HBs) <lb/>proteins under the control of the liver-specific murine albumin <lb/>promoter [6]. Although these transgenic mice have been shown to <lb/>develop chronic liver injury, regenerative hyperplasia, as well as <lb/>adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) [7,8] the <lb/>mechanisms of HBs proteins pathogenicity are poorly understood. <lb/>The HBs protein expression pattern in this mouse model mimics <lb/>the situation in the liver of patients with enhanced intracellular <lb/></body>

			<body>expression and retention of Hepatitis B virus surface proteins, e. g. <lb/>patients with Hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated <lb/>by transplantation. The liver damage in these patients was <lb/>attributable to a direct hepatocytotoxic effect of HBV, since they <lb/>were on a similar immunosuppresion regime [9,10]. <lb/>Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the <lb/>unfolded protein response (UPR) that is sensed by the binding <lb/>immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78 <lb/>(GRP78) [11-13]. Distinct branches of UPR are mediated by <lb/>three different classes of ER-membrane transducers: inositol-<lb/>requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 <lb/>(ATF6) or protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase <lb/>(PERK). PERK activation causes the phosphorylation of the <lb/>alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) <lb/>[11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a reduction in the <lb/>initiation of mRNA translation thus reducing the load of new <lb/>proteins that require folding in the ER. However, the expression of <lb/>some proteins is enhanced. One of them is the C/EBP <lb/>homologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and <lb/>DNA damage-inducible gene (GADD) 153 that mediates pro-<lb/>apoptotic pathways emanating from the stressed ER [11,14]. <lb/>Previously it was shown that GRP78 expression was increased in a <lb/>human hepatoma cell line that overproduced HBs proteins [15] <lb/>and in the liver of transgenic mice that expressed deletion mutant <lb/>of large HBs [16]. <lb/>Hepatic fibrosis constitutes the wound healing response to liver <lb/>injury. During fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation <lb/>represents a critical event, because these cells become the primary <lb/>source of extracellular matrix in the liver upon damage [17]. <lb/>Development of hepatic fibrosis after chemical liver injury is <lb/>enhanced in BALB/c mice exhibiting a Th2 response compared to <lb/>C57BL/6 mice, which demonstrated a primary Th1 response <lb/>[18]. Transgenic mice on fibrosis-resistant C57BL/6 genetic <lb/>background, which over-produce HBs proteins, develop modest <lb/>spontaneous liver fibrosis [19,20]. <lb/>Transcription factor c-Jun and signal transducer and activator <lb/>of transcription (STAT) 3 are implicated in several cellular <lb/>processes including proliferation, survival, and cell transformation <lb/>[21,22]. They are activated in chemically induced murine liver <lb/>tumours and in HCCs of humans [23,24], suggesting an important <lb/>function for these proteins in the development of liver tumours. <lb/>Here we report that the production of HBV surface proteins <lb/>stimulates the expression of CHOP in hepatocytes and could cause <lb/>stronger liver damage in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic <lb/>background compared to C57BL/6. Furthermore, HBV trans-<lb/>genic mice develop hepatic fibrosis and the level of fibrosis <lb/>depends on the genetic background. Although c-Jun transcription <lb/>factor up-regulation and activation of STAT3 and PERK in the <lb/>liver of transgenic mice might contribute to tumour development, <lb/>CHOP expression might reduce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice <lb/>on BALB/c genetic background. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Animal Model <lb/>Transgenic mice were maintained at the Central Animal <lb/>Laboratory of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen under specified <lb/>pathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strict <lb/>accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care <lb/>and Use of Laboratory Animals of the German law of animal <lb/>welfare. The mice received humane care, and all experiments <lb/>were approved by the Committee on the ethics of Animal <lb/>Experiments of the Regierungspraesidium Giessen, Giessen, <lb/>Germany (permit number: V54-19c 20 15 h 01 GI20/10 Nr. <lb/>52/2011 and Nr. A5/2012). <lb/>Generation and characteristics of transgenic lineages Tg(Alb-<lb/>1HBV), internal designation (HBVTg/6) have been described <lb/>previously [8]. The HBVTg/6 strain had an inbred C57BL/6 <lb/>genetic background and was propagated by crossing hemizygous <lb/>transgenic males to C57BL/6 females. These mice were <lb/>backcrossed to fibrosis susceptible BALB/c genetic background <lb/>[18] for at least 6 generations. The obtained transgenic mouse line <lb/>was internally designed HBVTg/c. At age of 12, 26, and 52 weeks <lb/>mice were killed by CO 2 -inhalation. Liver samples were collected <lb/>and preserved for analyses in accordance with application. Serum <lb/>samples were stored at 280uC until analysis of alanine amino-<lb/>transferase (ALT) by routine clinical chemistry on a Reflotron Plus <lb/>Analyzer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). <lb/>Histology and Hydroxyproline Assay <lb/>Immediately after necropsy, liver samples for histology were <lb/>fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 16 <lb/>hours and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were <lb/>stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or 0.1% Sirius Red <lb/>F3B in saturated picric acid (Chroma, Münster, Germany) for the <lb/>detection of collagen fibers [25]. The entire content of collagen <lb/>was determined by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification [26]. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry <lb/>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using ImmPRESS <lb/>Peroxidase Detection Reagents (Vector Laboratories) and anti-<lb/>bodies specific for HBsAg (20-HR20), GADD153 (F-168, Santa <lb/>Cruz), Desmin and GFAP (Lab Vision), c-Jun (60A8, Cell <lb/>Signaling), BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling). Colour reaction was <lb/>developed with VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit or DAB <lb/>Peroxidase Substrate Kit, (Vector Laboratories). The percentage <lb/>of BiP, Desmin, and GFAP-positive area was determined using <lb/>ImageJ image analysis system (National Institutes of Health, <lb/>Bethesda, MD, USA). <lb/>Western Blot Analysis <lb/>Total liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using <lb/>antibodies against HBsAg (20-HR20, Fitzgerald), GADD153 (F-<lb/>168, Santa Cruz), phospho-PERK (16F8, Cell Signaling), PERK <lb/>(H-300, Santa Cruz), phospho-eIF2a (119A11, Cell Signaling), <lb/>eIF2a (L57A5, Cell Signaling), b-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling), <lb/>JNK2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signaling), phospho-<lb/>c-Jun (D47G9, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11, Cell <lb/>Signaling), STAT3 (79D7, Cell Signaling), phospho-STAT3 <lb/>(D3A7, Cell Signaling). <lb/>Assay for HBV-specific proteins <lb/>HBsAg was measured in serum and in liver lysates by an in-<lb/>house sandwich ELISA as described [27]. HBsAg amount per <lb/>hepatocyte was calculated based on the hepatocellularity number <lb/>for mouse 135 million cells per gram of liver [28]. <lb/>Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) <lb/>RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR and quality control of all <lb/>steps were performed as described previously [29].

			<body>data presented here have been deposited in NCBI&apos;s Gene <lb/>Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) <lb/>and are accessible through GEO Series accession number <lb/>GSE40826. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS V.17.0 software <lb/>(SPSS Inc.). For non-normally distributed parameters, Mann-<lb/>Whitney U test and Spearman rank test were applied. The results <lb/>are presented as mean6SEM. A two-sided p,0.05 was considered <lb/>significant (shown as * in the figures]. <lb/>Results <lb/>Liver damage induced by HBs proteins expression <lb/>depends on host genetic background <lb/>Transgenic mice were sacrificed at week 12, 26, and 52. To <lb/>estimate the level of liver cell damage we have measured alanine <lb/>transaminase (ALT) in serum. Activities of serum ALT were <lb/>markedly increased already in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice <lb/>compared to the wild-type and remained at that level during the <lb/>observation period. In HBVTg/6 mice the ALT elevation was <lb/>moderate at week 12 but increased later to levels almost as high as <lb/>in HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1A). Histological analysis revealed no <lb/>significant lymphocyte infiltration of the liver from 12-week-old <lb/>transgenic mice (Figure S1A). Furthermore, amounts of HBsAg <lb/>per hepatocyte in 12-week-old mice were similar: 0.42 pg/cell <lb/>(range, 0.18-0.71 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and 0.31 pg/cell <lb/>(range, 0.15-0.64 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/6. Immunohisto-<lb/>chemical and Western blot analyses of livers from transgenic mice <lb/>also showed that distributions and expression levels of HBs <lb/>proteins were similar in mice on both C57BL/6 and BALB/c <lb/>genetic backgrounds (Figure S1B and S2). Moreover, amounts of <lb/>HBsAg in serum of transgenic mice did not differ significantly: <lb/>2.02 ng/ml (range, 0.68-3.19 ng/ml; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and <lb/>1.34 ng/ml (range, 0.68-2.55 ng/ml; n = 4) for HBVTg/6. Thus, <lb/>the elevated serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice could be a <lb/>consequence of a specific host response to the presence of HBs <lb/>proteins. <lb/>To identify the pathways which are activated in the HBs-<lb/>expressing liver tissue we carried out transcriptional profiling using <lb/>microarray analysis. As illustrated in Table 1 a set of genes that is <lb/>known to be induced by UPR is up-regulated in the liver of 12-<lb/>week-old transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of gene <lb/>ddit3 that encodes CHOP protein is stronger up-regulated in the <lb/>liver of HBVTg/c mice compared to HBVTg/6. To confirm this <lb/>finding we studied the expression of CHOP by qRT-PCR and <lb/>Western blot analysis. Transcription of the ddit3 gene was strongly <lb/>activated in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice and declined thereafter <lb/>with age, whereas in HBVTg/6 mice ddit3 transcription was rather <lb/>weakly enhanced in 12-week-old mice and increased with age <lb/>(Figure S3). Western blot analysis of liver proteins revealed that <lb/>CHOP was up-regulated much stronger in HBVTg/c mice <lb/>compared to HBVTg/6 (Fig. 1B). Selective CHOP translation <lb/>depends on eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK after induction of <lb/>UPR [11]. However, we detected similar level of PERK activation <lb/>and eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver from both mouse strains <lb/>irrespective of gender and age (Fig. 1C and D). Interestingly, other <lb/>UPR sensors ATF6 and IRE1 as well as eIF2a kinases PKR <lb/>(protein kinase R) and GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2) <lb/>[32] were not activated in the liver of transgenic mice (data not <lb/>shown). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of <lb/>transgenic mice leads to the specific activation of the PERK <lb/>branch of UPR in hepatocytes from both mouse strains, but <lb/>expression of CHOP was much stronger in HBVTg/c mice. <lb/>Enhanced translation of CHOP results in liver damage and could <lb/>explain higher serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice. <lb/>To examine the location of CHOP expressing hepatocytes <lb/>immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. According to our <lb/>previous finding a significant part of hepatocytes from 12-week-old <lb/>HBVTg/c mice accumulated CHOP in the nucleus and the <lb/>amount of CHOP-positive hepatocytes declined with age, whereas <lb/>we could detect only a few hepatocytes in HBVTg/6 liver <lb/>positively stained for CHOP independent of age (Figure 2A). <lb/>Interesting, CHOP-positive hepatocytes were located in centri-<lb/>lobular areas which surround a hepatic central vein (Figure 2A). <lb/>Furthermore, induction of UPR leads to activation of the major <lb/>sensor of unfolded protein accumulation BiP/GRP78 [12]. IHC <lb/>demonstrated strong expression of BiP in selected hepatocytes in <lb/>centrilobular areas (Figure 2B and Figure S4), although Western <lb/>blot analysis did not reveal any differences between wild-type and <lb/>transgenic mice in expression of BiP/GRP78 (data not shown). <lb/>Thus, expression of HBs proteins activated the UPR downstream <lb/>pathway (CHOP and BiP) much stronger in the liver of transgenic <lb/>mice on BALB/c genetic background compared to C57BL/6. <lb/>This activation is located in centrilobular zones of the liver. <lb/>Liver fibrosis <lb/>Measurement of liver hydroxyproline content demonstrated the <lb/>development of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice (Figure 3A). <lb/>Enhanced hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Sirius red staining as <lb/>well. We observed minimal fibrosis in the liver of 12-week-old <lb/>mice. But fibrosis constantly increased with age. However, <lb/>HBVTg/c mice accumulated more collagen (Figure S5). Hepatic <lb/>stellate cells (HSC) are the primary effector cells responsible for the <lb/>deposition of ECM in normal and fibrotic liver [33]. Therefore, <lb/>we tested the expression of HSC activation markers. We detected <lb/>increased amounts of GFAP-and desmin-positive cells in the liver <lb/>of transgenic mice, thus demonstrating HSC proliferation in the <lb/>liver of transgenic mice (Figure 3B and Figure S6). Moreover, <lb/>double staining of desmin with specific antibodies and collagen <lb/>with Sirius red has shown co-localization of HSCs with collagen <lb/>fibres (Figure S7). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in <lb/>mouse liver induces development of hepatic fibrosis, which <lb/>correlated with liver injury. HSCs might be the main collagen-<lb/>producing cells in this mouse model. <lb/>HBs protein-induced tumour development depends on <lb/>host genetic background <lb/>Microarray analysis showed an up-regulation of c-jun gene <lb/>expression in transgenic mice independent of genetic background <lb/>(Table 1). These results were confirmed using qPCR. Maximal <lb/>expression was detected in the liver of 52-week-old mice (Figure <lb/>S8). Expression of c-Jun protein was increased in the liver of 12-, <lb/>26-, and 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Major parts of <lb/>hepatocytes of 52-week-old mice accumulated c-Jun in the nucleus <lb/>(Figure S9). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase <lb/>(JNK) stimulates its ability to activate transcription [34,35]. <lb/>Western blot analyses demonstrated that JNKs were activated <lb/>(Figure 4B) and the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was indeed <lb/>increased in the liver of 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4C). <lb/>Thus, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of transgenic mice <lb/>leads to activation of c-Jun expression. <lb/>STAT3 activation was observed in mouse models of liver injury <lb/>and in human liver diseases in the context of inflammation and <lb/>cancer [22]. Therefore, we examined the status of STAT3 <lb/>activation in the liver of HBV transgenic mice. Western blot <lb/>analysis of liver protein extracts revealed STAT3 activation in the <lb/></body>

			<body>liver of male but not female mice (Figure 4D). Thus, expression of <lb/>HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice results in <lb/>STAT3 activation in a gender-dependent manner. <lb/>Up-regulation of c-Jun expression and STAT3 activation could <lb/>promote hepatic tumour growth [21,22]. We checked transgenic <lb/>mice for occurrence of liver tumour. In young mice (12-and 26-<lb/>week-old) mice we could detect no tumours. However, they were <lb/>detected in 100% (6/6) of 52-week-old male and 20% (1/5) of <lb/>female HBVTg/6 mice, whereas only 58% (7/12; X = 3.46; <lb/>p = 0.06) of 52-week-old male and 0% (0/6) of female HBVTg/c <lb/>mice develop tumours. Hence, development of tumours in HBV <lb/>transgenic mice was age-, gender-, and strain-dependent. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study we investigated the effects of HBVs proteins <lb/>expression in the liver of transgenic mice BALB/c and C57BL/6 <lb/>genetic background. Since we observed only weak strain-<lb/>independent immune cell infiltration of transgenic mice liver <lb/>(Figure S1) this model could be considered as one with impaired <lb/>immune reaction. One important negative impact of immune <lb/>deficiency on chronic HBV infection in human is related to the <lb/>direct cytotoxicity of high levels of HBs and other HBV proteins <lb/>[9,10,36]. Low serum HBsAG titers were associated with strong <lb/>intracellular accumulation of HBs in HBV transgenic mice on <lb/>both genetic backgrounds. This condition was also seen in some <lb/>patients with late phases of chronic HBV infection [37,38]. Thus, <lb/>transgenic mice expressing HBs proteins reflect the situation in the <lb/>liver of HBV-infected patients demonstrated strong retention of <lb/>HBsAg in hepatocytes. <lb/>Higher serum ALT activities in HBVTg/c mice suggest <lb/>stronger liver injury compared to HBVTg/6 (Figure 1A). Since <lb/>the level of cellular infiltration was low in the liver of transgenic <lb/>mice on both genetic backgrounds we searched for other reasons <lb/>of hepatocyte death. Increased CHOP expression as a result of <lb/>prolonged ER stress promotes cell death, whereas CHOP deletion <lb/>protects against the death of ER-stressed cells [14]. Strongly <lb/>increased transcription and protein accumulation of CHOP in <lb/>HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1B and 2A; Figure S3) inducing <lb/>hepatocyte death could explain increased serum ALT level in <lb/>these mice. Expression of CHOP is mediated by phosphorylation <lb/>of eIF2a [32] that in turn is phosphorylated by PERK [11]. <lb/>Interestingly, levels of PERK activation and eIF2a phosphoryla-<lb/>tion were similar in the liver of both HBV transgenic mouse strains <lb/>(Figure 1C and 1D). Two other branches of UPR IRE1a and <lb/>ATF6 were not activated in the liver of HBV transgenic mice (data <lb/>not shown). PERK branch activation is largely sustained with <lb/>unmitigated ER stress, whereas persistent ER stress attenuates <lb/>IRE1a and ATF6 signaling [39]. Therefore, permanent expres-<lb/>sion of HBs proteins leads to the activation of persistent ER stress <lb/>in hepatocytes that induces PERK and impairs another branches <lb/>Figure 1. HBs proteins-induced liver injury depends on host genetic background. (A) Assessment of liver damage in wild-type and HBV <lb/>transgenic mice.

			<body>of UPR. It is possible that this situation is common for chronic <lb/>liver disease comprising ER stress induction. <lb/>It was previously shown that despite PERK activation and <lb/>eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic <lb/>fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis <lb/>(NASH), downstream effectors such as CHOP remain inactive <lb/>[40]. A similar situation was observed in the liver of HBV <lb/>transgenic mice on C57BL/6 genetic background. However, <lb/>stimulation of CHOP and BiP expression in HBVTg/c mice <lb/>demonstrated that the outcome of UPR induction depends on the <lb/>genetic background of subjects. Furthermore, several studies have <lb/>demonstrated that PERK function is critical for maintaining <lb/>cellular redox homeostasis, promotes cancer cell proliferation and <lb/>tumour growth [41]. Thus, sustained activation of PERK could <lb/>also promote cancer development in the liver of HBV transgenic <lb/>mice. <lb/>Global reduction of translation initiation due to PERK-<lb/>mediated eIF2a phosphorylation [32] should also affect the <lb/>expression of HBs proteins in the liver. This suggests the following <lb/>feed-back mechanism: PERK activation results in the reduction of <lb/>HBs translation and that leads to a balance between PERK <lb/>activation and HBs protein synthesis in hepatocytes. <lb/>Development of tumours in HBV transgenic mice as it was <lb/>shown by us and others [8] is age-, gender-, and strain-dependent. <lb/>In this study we observed a strong up-regulation of c-Jun hepatic <lb/>expression and an activation of STAT3, whose role in tumori-<lb/>genesis is well established [22,23,42]. Jun controls liver cancer <lb/>initiation and is required for development of chemically induced <lb/>HCC [23]. Interestingly, transgenic mice comprising the whole or <lb/>partial HBV genome are also more susceptible to chemically <lb/>induced hepatocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Likewise, hepatitis C virus <lb/>core protein potentiates chemically induced HCC through c-Jun <lb/>and STAT3 activation [45]. Thus, stimulation of c-Jun expression <lb/>and STAT3 activation by HBs proteins could promote the <lb/>development of liver cancer induced by different causes, such as <lb/>sustained inflammation, activation of oncogenes etc. Furthermore, <lb/>the finding that STAT3 was activated in male mice only correlated <lb/>with our observation that tumour development in HBV transgenic <lb/>mice is gender-dependent. There is accumulating evidence that <lb/>tumour-specific ER stress can be exploited for cancer therapy by <lb/>treatment with ER stress-aggravating compounds [46]. Moderate, <lb/>transient ER stress response represents an adaptive mechanism to <lb/>support cellular survival. However, severe and excessive stress <lb/>conditions could turn this response system to its pro-apoptotic <lb/>mode. Stimulation of CHOP expression in HBVTg/c mice <lb/>indicated an activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress responses in <lb/>the liver and resulted in reduced tumour incidence in 52-week-old <lb/>HBVTg/c mice. <lb/>Taken together, the outcome of HBV surface proteins <lb/>expression in the liver of transgenic mice depends on the host <lb/>genetic background. Liver injury and fibrosis were increased in <lb/>transgenic mice on BALB/c background compared to C57BL/6 <lb/>correlating with strong expression of PERK downstream pro-<lb/>apoptotic effector CHOP. More interesting finding is genetic <lb/>background-independent stimulation of c-Jun expression together <lb/>with STAT3 and PERK activation promoting cancer cell <lb/>proliferation and tumour growth. However, activation of pro-<lb/>apoptotic cellular stress response could result in reduced tumour <lb/>incidence in the liver. <lb/></body>
