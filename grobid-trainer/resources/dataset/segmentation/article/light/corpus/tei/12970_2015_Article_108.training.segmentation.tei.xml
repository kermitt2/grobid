Little is known about actual <lb/>athletes&apos; beliefs, knowledge and nutritional behaviour. We monitored nutritional behaviour of amateur <lb/>ski-mountaineering athletes during 4 days prior to a major competition to compare it with official recommendations <lb/>and with the athletes&apos; beliefs. <lb/> Methods: Participants to the two routes of the &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; were recruited (A, 26 km, ascent 1881 m, <lb/>descent 2341 m, max altitude 3160 m; Z, 53 km, ascent 3994 m, descent 4090 m, max altitude 3650 m). Dietary intake <lb/>diaries of 40 athletes (21 A, 19 Z) were analysed for energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein and liquid; ten were interviewed <lb/>about their pre-race nutritional beliefs and behaviour. <lb/> Results: Despite belief that pre-race carbohydrate, energy and fluid intake should be increased, energy consumption <lb/>was 2416 ± 696 (mean ± SD) kcal · day  −1  , 83 ± 17 % of recommended intake, carbohydrate intake was only 46 ± 13 % of <lb/>minimal recommended (10 g · kg  −1  · day  −1  ) and fluid intake only 2.7 ± 1.0 l · day  −1  . <lb/> Conclusions: Our sample of endurance athletes did not comply with pre-race nutritional recommendations despite <lb/>elementary knowledge and belief to be compliant. In these athletes a clear and reflective nutritional strategy was <lb/>lacking. This suggests a potential for improving knowledge and compliance with recommendations. Alternatively, <lb/>some recommendations may be unrealistic. <lb/> Keywords: Endurance activity, Food behaviour, Food beliefs, Pre-race nutrition, Energy intake, Ski-mountaineering <lb/></front>

			<body> Background <lb/> For endurance activities with high levels of energy ex-<lb/>penditure, energy intake is an important variable to be <lb/>considered when devising strategies for optimizing per-<lb/>formance [1–3]. High exercise intensities over prolonged <lb/>periods imply high carbohydrate (CHO) and also fat oxi-<lb/>dation rates [4]. CHO and fat availability are thus im-<lb/>portant determinants of energy expenditure and it is <lb/>paramount that athletes use optimal nutritional strat-<lb/>egies, not only to manage intake during races, but also <lb/>before races, to optimize storage, and after races, to <lb/>optimize refuelling [2, 3, 5–7]. There exists a plethora of <lb/>literature on sports nutrition, and several scientific and <lb/>sports organizations such as the American Dietetic As-<lb/>sociation (ADA), the Dieticians of Canada (DC) and the <lb/>American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) [2, 8], the <lb/>International Olympic Committee (IOC) [9] and the <lb/>International Society for Sport Nutrition (ISSN) [10, 11] <lb/>have published recommendations and guidelines on en-<lb/>ergy intake before, during and after exercise [3]. Para-<lb/>doxically, there is relative paucity of literature reporting <lb/>actual athlete nutritional behaviour [12]. Among ath-<lb/>letes, actual nutritional behaviour does not always com-<lb/>ply with the official recommendations, because of a lack <lb/>of knowledge [13], mistaken beliefs, lack of interest or <lb/>motivation, practical problems, or perhaps intuition [14]. <lb/>Nutrition knowledge and beliefs can influence food be-<lb/>haviour [15], even if the relationship is not necessarily <lb/>obvious. Improved nutritional knowledge plays a role in <lb/>the adoption of healthier food habits [16, 17] and this is <lb/></body>

			<body> likely also the case for sport nutrition. Better insight into <lb/>actual athlete behaviour and its determinants is of im-<lb/>portance for adapting guidelines in view of improving <lb/>compliance [18, 19]. <lb/>A particular type endurance sport is ski-mountaineering <lb/>racing, consisting of climbing uphill on alpine skis with <lb/>the heals unlocked in special pivoting bindings and adhe-<lb/>sive skins applied to the gliding surface, alternated by ski-<lb/>ing downhill with the skins removed and the bindings in <lb/>the locked position. What makes this sport particular is <lb/>that it combines very strenuous activity in different loco-<lb/>motion modes with exposure to altitude hypoxia and <lb/>temperature extremes. Especially uphill the exercise inten-<lb/>sity is high with a large fraction of time spend around the <lb/>respiratory compensation threshold [20–22]. The most <lb/>popular and famous ski-mountaineering races are gener-<lb/>ally team races that can last from 4 to more than 12 h. We <lb/>previously quantified energy expenditure during a famous <lb/>Swiss ski-mountaineering race (&apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos;) <lb/>and found that it was very high: more than 20 MJ <lb/>(4,800 kcal) for the shorter race route (distance: 26 km; <lb/>altitude differences: +1881 m and −2341 m; maximal alti-<lb/>tude: 3160 m) and more than 35 MJ (8,400 kcal) for the <lb/>longer one (distance: 53 km; altitude differences: +3994 m <lb/>and−4090 m; maximal altitude: 3650 m) [22]. <lb/>The goal of the present study was to get a global per-<lb/>spective on pre-race nutritional habits among amateur <lb/>ski-mountaineers during the 4 days preceding this major <lb/>multi-hour ski-mountaineering race. Four different as-<lb/>pects were investigated: 1) pre-competition nutritional <lb/>practice; 2) comparison between practice and recom-<lb/>mendations; 3) comparison of food behaviour between <lb/>participants in longer and shorter races; and 4) know-<lb/>ledge and beliefs about pre-race nutrition. <lb/> Methods <lb/> Seventy participants in two multi-hour ski-mountaineering <lb/>races were recruited for a study about ski-mountaineering <lb/>racing (Fig. 1). They were healthy and trained skiers, who <lb/>took part in one of the two racecourses of the &apos;Patrouille <lb/> des Glaciers&apos; 2012 [22]. The nutritional part of the study <lb/>was optional for participants. The Valais cantonal research <lb/>ethics committee approved the protocol of the study <lb/>(CCVEM 033/11) and each participant gave informed <lb/>written consent prior to participation. <lb/> Laboratory measurements <lb/> Between 2 and 3 months prior to the race, the subjects <lb/>came to the laboratory, where anthropometric features, <lb/>body composition and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) <lb/>were determined. Body fat percentage was measured by <lb/>air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, Cosmed, <lb/>Italy). The subjects performed a maximal running test <lb/>on a motorized treadmill (HP Cosmos Pulsar, Germany) <lb/>to determine VO 2max . After warm-up (3 min at 5.4 km · <lb/>h  −1  ), speed was set at 7.2 km · h  −1  and increased by <lb/>1.8 km · h  −1  every 3 min without breaks between stages <lb/>up to voluntary exhaustion under strong verbal encour-<lb/>agement. The inclination of the treadmill was 0 %. Gas <lb/>exchange and breathing variables were measured breath-<lb/>by-breath throughout with a metabolic measurement <lb/>system (Metalyser, Cortex, Germany). The data obtained <lb/>during the last 30 s of each step were considered for the <lb/>analysis. The metabolic system was calibrated prior to <lb/>each experimental session with a 3 l syringe and gases of <lb/>known composition. <lb/> The races <lb/> The &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; is the most famous and popu-<lb/>lar ski-mountaineering race in Switzerland. It is a long <lb/>duration high altitude team race (teams of three) and con-<lb/>sists of two different race routes: race Z from Zermatt to <lb/>Verbier (distance: 53 km; altitude differences: +3994 m <lb/>and−4090 m; maximal altitude: 3650 m) and race A from <lb/>Arolla to Verbier (distance: 26 km; altitude differences: <lb/>+1881 m and−2341 m; maximal altitude: 3160 m). <lb/> Food intake <lb/> We asked the subjects to complete food diaries during the <lb/>4 days preceding the race. They had to write down every-<lb/>thing they ate or drank with as much detail as possible <lb/>about the quality and quantity of food items consumed. <lb/>The subjects received detailed instructions and examples <lb/>to help them to appropriately complete their diaries.

			<body> data were analysed with a nutrient analysis software pack-<lb/>age (Prodi 5.3, Nutri-Science GmbH, Germany). <lb/>Fifty-three journals were collected: 13 were eliminated <lb/>from analysis, because they were incomplete, unclear or <lb/>unreadable. 40 journals were analysed: 19 were journals <lb/>of subjects of race Z (4 women and 15 men, 30 ± <lb/>10 years, 176 ± 7 cm, 70 ± 9 kg, 15 ± 5 % of fat mass, <lb/>VO 2max : 50 ± 8 ml · kg  −1  · min  −1  and 21 of race A (6 <lb/>women and 15 men, 40 ± 7 years, 176 ± 7 cm, 72 ± <lb/>10 kg, 18 ± 8 % fat mass, VO 2max : 58 ± 8 ml · kg  −1  · <lb/>min  −1  ). Energy, macronutrients (CHO, fat and pro-<lb/>teins) and liquid intakes were analysed. <lb/> Beliefs <lb/> Using the diaries, individual semi-structured interviews <lb/>were held two years later with a pool of 10 subjects of <lb/>those with a complete diary. These interviews focused <lb/>on the beliefs about feeding before the race. There were <lb/>six main questions: 1) tell me more about the import-<lb/>ance that you assigned to nutrition during the prepar-<lb/>ation for the race; 2) what was your food behaviour <lb/>during the 4 days preceding the race; 3) tell me more <lb/>about your liquid intake during the 4 days preceding the <lb/>race; 4) if you were used to consume food supplements, <lb/>what importance did you assign to these during the <lb/>4 days preceding the race; 5) if you were used to con-<lb/>sume sports food, which importance did you assign to <lb/>these during the 4 days preceding the race; and 6) where <lb/>did you get your information about the nutrition and <lb/>food strategies you applied? Based on the initial answers <lb/>to these questions the interviewers asked the partici-<lb/>pants further questions, to develop and explore details <lb/>about points that seemed to be especially interesting or <lb/>needed clarification. Five subjects for each race route <lb/>were interviewed. We purposely handpicked a diversified <lb/>sample: three women and seven men, 22 to 56 years, 5 <lb/>to 37 % of fat mass, VO 2 max from 32 to 67 ml kg  −1  · <lb/>min  −1  (40 ± 10 years, 175 ± 6 cm, 70 ± 11 kg, 16 ± 9 % of <lb/>fat mass, VO 2 max: 53 ± 10 ml · kg  −1  · min  −1  ). <lb/> Statistical analysis <lb/> An ANOVA was used to test whether the four analysed <lb/>days were similar and to see if pooled mean values could <lb/>be used for further analysis. For each nutrient the mean <lb/>and standard deviation values were calculated for the <lb/>whole population and for the participants in the race Z <lb/>and the race A separately. T-tests were performed to verify <lb/>if there were differences between the participants in the <lb/>shorter and the longer race. Linear regressions were per-<lb/>formed to verify associations between sex, body compos-<lb/>ition or VO 2 max and aspects of nutritional behaviour. <lb/>Data were analysed with the software Stata (StataCorp, <lb/>USA). A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. <lb/> Results <lb/> Food intake and recommendations <lb/> There was no significant difference concerning the main <lb/>analysed variables (energy, CHO and drinking intake) <lb/>between the four analysed days, so the data were pooled <lb/>and the mean values of the 4 days were used for further <lb/>analysis. The mean energy consumption was 2416 ± <lb/>696 kcal · day  −1  . 54 ± 8 % of the daily energy intake was <lb/>from CHO, 28 ± 6 % from fat and 18 ± 5 % from protein <lb/>(Table 1, Fig. 1). CHO intake was 46 ± 13 % below the <lb/>recommended intake levels (10–12 g · body weight <lb/>(BW) · day  −1  ) (Fig. 1). Consequently energy consumption <lb/>was low too (83 ± 17 % of recommended intake (Harris <lb/>and Benedict · 1.8 (low exercise intensity, corresponding <lb/>to a pre-race tapering period) [2]), but the deficit was <lb/>limited because fat and protein intake partly compen-<lb/>sated the lack of CHO intake (Fig. 2). The energy intake <lb/>through fat was 29 ± 6 % (Fig. 3) of the total daily energy <lb/>intake (recommendations: between 15 and 30 %) while <lb/>protein intake was 100 ± 28 % of the minimal recom-<lb/>mended intake for athletes in daily life (1.3 g · kg  −1  BW · <lb/>day  −1  ). The mean liquid intake was 2.7 ± 1.0 l · day  −1 <lb/> (slightly above recommendations, 1 ml · kcal  −1  · day  −1  in <lb/>daily life, 2.4 l · day  −1  ), partly compliant with the guide-<lb/>lines to already increase the liquid intake before the be-<lb/>ginning of a race, without giving a specific amount [23]. <lb/>One third of the participants took mineral or vitamin <lb/>supplements. Magnesium was the most commonly used <lb/>mineral (25 % of the participants) while vitamin supple-<lb/>ment intake was also frequent (20 % of the participants). <lb/>23 participants (58 %) consumed CHO-rich sports food <lb/>or drinks, of which 20 % took maltodextrin to increase <lb/>CHO intake. <lb/>There were few differences between the nutritional be-<lb/>haviour of men and women: men consumed more en-<lb/>ergy from fat (p = 0.049) and tended to consume less <lb/>energy from CHO (p = 0.061) than women.

Six of <lb/>the 10 interviewed subjects found it important or very <lb/>important while four found it of little or moderate im-<lb/>portance. Three common representations could be <lb/>highlighted in the interviews: 1) during the 4 days before <lb/>such a race it is good to eat (lots of ) pasta to fill up en-<lb/>ergy stores (all interviewed subjects); 2) during these <lb/>days water intake has to be increased (9/10); and 3) it is <lb/>better to eat white meat than red meat (5/10). <lb/>For the comparison of beliefs with practice, as esti-<lb/>mated with the food diaries, we found, on the basis of <lb/>eight main meals over the 4 days analysed for each sub-<lb/>ject: 1) On average 4.9 ± 1.2 of them included pasta <lb/>(55 % of meals); these values were 4.4 ± 1.2 meals and <lb/>61 %, respectively, for all 40 subjects; 2) The subjects <lb/>drank 2.2 ± 1.4 l · day  −1  (2.7 ± 1.0 l · day  −1  for all 40 par-<lb/>ticipants); 3) For the participants in the race Z, who had <lb/>dinner just before the race (the participants in the race <lb/>A started in the morning and had breakfast as the last <lb/>meal before the race): two of the five interviewed sub-<lb/>jects ate white meat during the last dinner (8 of the 19 <lb/>participants (42 %) who completed the food journal). <lb/>In order to enhance performance and to ensure digest-<lb/>ive comfort, some other food items were avoided: four <lb/>athletes avoided or decreased fat food intake (in particu-<lb/>lar cheese), three athletes spoke about alcohol avoidance, <lb/>one of the ten took care not to eat too much and one <lb/>avoided vegetables and salads. <lb/> Fig. 2 Average percentage of the daily energy intake from CHO, fat and protein.

			<body> Most of the subjects spoke about food supplements <lb/>(6/10). Four athletes took magnesium (against muscle <lb/>cramps (3) or to improve blood flow (1)); one athlete took <lb/>calcium (also against muscle cramps), one of them spoke <lb/>about caffeine and one about vitamins.

			<body> was below recommended amounts, while protein and fat <lb/>intake were close to the recommended intake; 2) the <lb/>main difference between the participants in the shorter <lb/>and longer races were liquid, supplement and sports <lb/>food intakes; and 3) that knowledge and beliefs about <lb/>pre-race nutrition among these amateur athletes partici-<lb/>pating to extreme endurance events are insufficient or <lb/>incorrect. <lb/>It is generally believed that high CHO intake to <lb/>optimize glycogen storage is the most specific and im-<lb/>portant recommendation for endurance activity to en-<lb/>sure an appropriate energy supply all along a multi hour <lb/>endurance race [5]. The CHO stores (muscle and liver <lb/>glycogen) are limited and need to be regularly refuelled. <lb/>CHO ingestion is thus thought to be very important, <lb/>whether it is to increase glycogen storage before a work-<lb/>out, during a race to avoid hypoglycaemia and to protect <lb/>muscle and liver glycogen stores, or after a race to en-<lb/>sure recovery and optimal glycogen resynthesis [6, 7]. <lb/>Low muscle glycogen stores during exercise, when ac-<lb/>companied by dropping blood glucose levels can cause <lb/>performance decreases, subjective feelings of low levels <lb/>of energy, sensation of heavy legs, excess fatigue, loss of <lb/>concentration, irritability, dizziness and fainting [7, 24]. <lb/>So it is important to ensure glycogen store fuelling and <lb/>refuelling and it is better to start a race with full stores <lb/>[6, 7], especially since the capacity to eat and process <lb/>food during a race is limited [25]. Current recommenda-<lb/>tions for CHO storage before an endurance race are 10 <lb/>to 12 g · kg BW  −1  · day  −1  , starting 36 to 48 h prior to the <lb/>race [2, 9, 10]. <lb/>The average CHO consumption in our population was <lb/>less than half (46 ± 13 %) of these recommended levels <lb/>and in fact not even a single participant to our study <lb/>reached them. Given the belief of the interviewed ath-<lb/>letes, that high CHO intake is important prior to such <lb/>endurance events, this finding is surprising and possibly <lb/>suggests lack of understanding of the concept of pre-<lb/>race CHO loading. On the other hand, it may also reflect <lb/>difficulties in reaching the recommended CHO amounts <lb/>just by varying the quantities and proportions of the <lb/>usual dietary components, without using additional spe-<lb/>cific CHO-rich sports food to allow the athletes reaching <lb/>CHO and total energy-intake values closer to the guide-<lb/>lines. Our observations lead us to ask the question <lb/>whether today&apos;s guidelines are adequate for practical use. <lb/>The observed average CHO consumption in our sample <lb/>was so far from the recommendations that it suggests that <lb/>it might have been too difficult for our participants to <lb/>reach the recommendations by consuming twice as much <lb/>CHO as they did, even if it were only during the last 24 to <lb/>36 h and not during the full 4 days we looked at. <lb/>For the other macronutrients: fat and proteins, there <lb/>are no specific pre-race recommendations for endurance <lb/>activities, but there are guidelines for athletes in daily <lb/>life. Endurance athletes are advised to consume between <lb/>1.2 and 1.8 g · kg BW -1 · day  −1  of protein [8, 9] and daily <lb/>fat intake should amount to 20 to 35 % of total energy <lb/>intake [2, 8–10]. For these nutrients the intakes of the <lb/>subjects complied with the guidelines. <lb/>Fluid and electrolyte intake are thought to be important <lb/>for performance because dehydration, when exceeding 2-<lb/>3 % of body mass, may cause performance impairment <lb/>[2], even though there is on-going debate on this topic <lb/>[26]. So it is important to start races in euhydration and to <lb/>drink enough and frequently during races [8]. Since we <lb/>only have information about pre-race behaviour and have <lb/>no data on habitual fluid intake in our subjects we do not <lb/>know if, according to the recommendations, they in-<lb/>creased their fluid intake prior to the race. Intake was on <lb/>average 2.7 l · day  −1  , which is slightly above the recom-<lb/>mendations for habitual daily intake (2.4 l · day  −1  ) [23]. <lb/>Also in this case the beliefs of the interviewed ath-<lb/>letes contrast with their behaviour since 9 out of 10 <lb/>mentioned the importance of increasing liquid intake <lb/>in the last days prior to a major race but only drank <lb/>an average 2.2 l · day  −1  . <lb/>Although several studies showed that vitamin and/or <lb/>mineral supplementation does not improve performance <lb/>during anaerobic [27], strength [28], endurance [28, 29] <lb/>or ultra-endurance [30] exercise, if the daily diet is <lb/>adequate [31], supplement intake remains widespread <lb/>among athletes [30, 32, 33]. In our population, a third of <lb/>the participants took such supplements. The recommen-<lb/>dation is to abstain from vitamin or mineral supplemen-<lb/>tation if the athlete eats enough and a wide variety of <lb/>food and in the absence of a known deficit [3]. Addition-<lb/>ally, it is important to be careful and to estimate the <lb/>safety, the efficacy, the potency and the legality of a sup-<lb/>plement before taking it [2, 8–10]. Besides supplements, <lb/>special sports food consumption was also widespread. <lb/>Endurance athletes mostly consume special CHO drinks, <lb/>gels or bars, which can help reaching the recommenda-<lb/>tions for energy and CHO intake [18, 34]. But in spite of <lb/>58 % of the 40 participants using CHO-rich sports food <lb/>or drinks, their CHO intake remained far below the <lb/>recommendations. <lb/>Digestive comfort is another key variable during en-<lb/>durance events such as multi-hour ski-mountaineering <lb/>races [35, 36]. Digestive discomfort and gastrointestinal <lb/>distress like cramps, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and diar-<lb/>rhoea are frequently reported during ultra-endurance <lb/>activities, particularly during ultra-marathon running <lb/>[35–37]. To avoid gastrointestinal distress during racing, <lb/>athletes are advised to avoid dehydration, high-fibre food <lb/>intake, and hypertonic beverages, and to practice their <lb/>planned race nutrition strategies before the actual race <lb/>[36–38]. It is difficult to say from the food diaries which <lb/></body>

			<body> food items were specifically avoided during these 4 days, <lb/>because we do not know the habitual diet of the partici-<lb/>pants, but from the interviews it seemed that mostly red <lb/>meat and other fatty food items were avoided. <lb/>In general, the athletes seemed to be well aware of the <lb/>importance of pre-race nutrition for performance. The <lb/>participants in the longer race Z placed a more particu-<lb/>lar emphasis on this topic than the participants to the <lb/>shorter race A. They also trained more, used lighter <lb/>racing gear (12.4 ± 2.5 kg vs. 15.4 ± 3.2 kg) and their sup-<lb/>plement and sports food intake was higher. The partici-<lb/>pants in the longer Z race were likely more ambitious <lb/>and experienced athletes, who tried noticeably harder to <lb/>optimize everything for the race. Our finding of lower <lb/>lipid consumption by participants with a higher VO 2 max <lb/>and/or lower body fat percentage, as well as the higher <lb/>energy, CHO and liquid consumption of participants <lb/>with lower body fat percentage also seem in accordance <lb/>with this contention. <lb/>In spite of the declared importance of adequate nutri-<lb/>tion in preparation of an endurance event, the knowledge <lb/>on this topic was approximate. Half of the interviewed <lb/>participants confused supplementation with sports food; <lb/>all the participants believed that it is good for them to eat <lb/>a lot of pasta during the 4 days preceding the race, but <lb/>rarely spoke about CHO and other CHO sources. More-<lb/>over, it seemed to be difficult for them to explain why they <lb/>choose some food items and avoided others. The overall <lb/>impression was that it rather reflected beliefs than know-<lb/>ledge [15]. <lb/>The finding in the interviewed athletes that they under-<lb/>estimated their sports food and supplement intake com-<lb/>pared to the intake reported in the food journals is <lb/>probably partly due to the long period of time between <lb/>the real intake and the interviews. But another important <lb/>reason for this difference is probably the fact that the ath-<lb/>letes did not follow a clear strategy based on solid know-<lb/>ledge. This lack of a clear knowledge and strategy can be a <lb/>reason for the far too low energy and CHO consumption. <lb/> Limitations <lb/> Our results should be interpreted taking into account <lb/>some study limitations. Despite participation of 70 sub-<lb/>jects to the study we obtained only 40 complete food in-<lb/>take diaries that could be analysed of which 25 % was <lb/>discussed in detail during the face-to-face semi-structured <lb/>interviews. The number of observations is therefore lim-<lb/>ited and not necessarily representative for all amateur ath-<lb/>letes participating to the &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; and <lb/>similar extreme endurance events. Also, the interviews <lb/>were performed two years after the race and obviously <lb/>some detail may have been lost. However, it is unlikely <lb/>that the major individual beliefs changed over these two <lb/>years [39]. The overall strategy, grounded in the personal <lb/>beliefs was probably close to that of race day. Finally, food <lb/>diaries are known to be unreliable with frequent under <lb/>and ill reporting of intake [40], so that our results should <lb/>be interpreted as semi-quantitative. <lb/> Conclusions <lb/> This study about pre-competition nutritional habits and <lb/>beliefs of amateur athletes before a long duration ski-<lb/>mountaineering race showed that: although most of the <lb/>athletes seemed aware of the importance of nutrition for <lb/>endurance sports and specifically before a major race, <lb/>their knowledge was approximate and a clear sound nu-<lb/>tritional strategy was missing. Their average CHO intake <lb/>represented less than half of the recommended intake, <lb/>while energy intake was on average 17 % too low. There <lb/>was no significant difference in the energy and macronu-<lb/>trient intake of the participants in the longer and the <lb/>shorter race, but participants in the longer race drank <lb/>significantly more, used more mineral and vitamin sup-<lb/>plements and more sports food and drinks. <lb/>Taking into consideration all of these issues, some rec-<lb/>ommendations can be formulated for pre-race nutrition: <lb/> 1) The athletes should be better informed about <lb/>nutrition to allow them developing an evidence-<lb/>based conscious and reflective feeding strategy. <lb/>2) A high priority should be given to CHO intake. The <lb/>amount should be increased with traditional food <lb/>(pasta, rice, bread, etc.), completed with CHO-rich <lb/>sports food and drinks. <lb/>3) The chosen pre-race nutritional strategy should be <lb/>experimented before that prior to the actual race <lb/>(e.g. before a hard training period or a less important <lb/>competition) to ensure that it does not cause <lb/>gastrointestinal distress. <lb/></body>
