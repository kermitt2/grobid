Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that <lb/>are &apos;intrinsic&apos;, meaning they affect viability and sterility in the <lb/>laboratory. There is increasing evidence, however, that ecolog-<lb/>ical selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities. In this <lb/>article, we compiled genetic data for F 2 hybrid crosses between <lb/>divergent populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus <lb/>aculeatus L.) fish that were raised in either the field or the labo-<lb/>ratory and tested for differences in excess heterozygosity-a ge-<lb/>netic signature of selection against incompatibilities-between <lb/>environments. We found that excess heterozygosity was elevated <lb/>by approximately 3% in crosses raised in the field compared to <lb/>those raised in aquaria. A simple model illustrates that fairly <lb/>weak per-incompatibility selection coefficients (s &lt; 0.003) can <lb/>generate this result. Previous results of selection against F 1 hy-<lb/>brids in ponds suggest that pond-specific heterosis is unlikely <lb/>to explain this finding. Our study suggests that, in stickleback, <lb/>environment-dependent hybrid incompatibilities are detectable <lb/>and could evolve before intrinsic incompatibilities. <lb/>hybridization | speciation | phenotypic mismatch | opposing dominance <lb/>Correspondence: ken.thompson@zoology.ubc.ca <lb/></front>

			<body>Hybrid incompatibilities-interactions among divergent <lb/>genetic loci that reduce the fitness of hybrids-are a key com-<lb/>ponent of reproductive isolation between diverging lineages <lb/>(Coyne and Orr 2004). Incompatibilities have been studied <lb/>most intensively in the context of sterility and mortality, in <lb/>part because these traits are conducive to reliable phenotyp-<lb/>ing in the laboratory and often seem to be underpinned by <lb/>few loci (Fishman and Sweigart 2018; Maheshwari and Bar-<lb/>bash 2011). These sorts of barriers have come to be called <lb/>&apos;intrinsic&apos; hybrid incompatibilities due to the fact that there <lb/>are conflicts within the hybrid genome that are expected to <lb/>impact hybrids in most environmental contexts (though note <lb/>that the strength of selection against some intrinsic incom-<lb/>patibilities can vary across environments [Demuth and Wade <lb/>2007]). Studies have shown that the number of intrinsic in-<lb/>compatibilities tends to increase with genetic divergence be-<lb/>tween parents (Matute et al. 2010; Moyle and Nakazato 2010; <lb/>Wang et al. 2013) and that incompatibilities are common <lb/>throughout the genomes of isolated populations of a given <lb/>species (Corbett-Detig et al., 2013). Collectively, these stud-<lb/>ies have made substantial progress toward identifying gen-<lb/>eralities about the evolutionary genetics of intrinsic hybrid <lb/>incompatibilities. <lb/>Incompatibilities can also be caused by ecological se-<lb/>lection if particular allele combinations render hybrids un-<lb/>able to perform ecological functions such as predator avoid-<lb/>ance or prey capture. Several recent studies have shown pat-<lb/>terns to this effect, wherein hybrids have &apos;mismatched&apos; trait <lb/>combinations and reduced fitness as a result (Arnegard et al., <lb/>2014; Thompson et al., 2021). Such studies have successfully <lb/>demonstrated incompatibilities via interactions among traits, <lb/>but links to the underlying genetics have not been made. Per-<lb/>haps the most significant barrier to progress in measuring <lb/>&apos;ecological&apos; hybrid incompatibilities is that they might be <lb/>difficult to detect for polygenic traits because of small indi-<lb/>vidual effect sizes (Rockman 2012). For example, Arnegard <lb/>et al. (2014) found that combining divergent jaw bone traits <lb/>together in an F 2 stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) hy-<lb/>brid reduced their fitness because these traits interacted in a <lb/>manner that rendered hybrids unable to effectively generate <lb/>suction for feeding. The underlying interacting jaw bones <lb/>map to several regions of the genome that individually ex-<lb/>plain a small fraction (&lt; 10%) of the phenotypic variance, <lb/>thus rendering it difficult to study their individual fitness ef-<lb/>fects. <lb/>Recent theoretical advances, however, suggest ways to <lb/>test for and measure the net effect of hybrid incompatibilities <lb/>using experimental crosses. Specifically, selection against <lb/>hybrid incompatibilities in an F 2 hybrid cross manifests as <lb/>selection for increased ancestry heterozygosity (Barton and <lb/>Gale, 1993; Simon et al., 2018). This is expected because F 2 <lb/>hybrids have a hybrid index of approximately 0.5-having <lb/>half of their alleles from one parental species and half from <lb/>the other. Thus, individuals with high heterozygosity rela-<lb/>tive to their hybrid index have fewer pairs of homozygous <lb/>loci with opposite ancestry than more homozygous individ-<lb/>uals. Having many loci with opposite homozygous ancestry <lb/>can result in hybrids with maladaptive &apos;mismatched&apos; pheno-<lb/>types, whereas highly heterozygous individuals are expected <lb/></body>

Results from simulations illustrating an ecological mechanism underlying the heterozygosity-incompatibility relationship in F2 hybrids (see Supplementary <lb/>Methods for details).

Variation along the axis connecting parents captures <lb/>variation in the &apos;hybrid index&apos;. The plot shows that mismatch is lower in more heterozygous F2s. Heterozygosity values are discrete because a small number of loci underlie <lb/>adaptation in the plotted simulation run. See the supplementary methods for simulation methods and underlying assumptions. <lb/>to be relatively intermediate (Fig. 1). Whether &apos;mismatch&apos; <lb/>affects fitness, however, ultimately depends on the ecology <lb/>of the system and the underlying fitness landscape. Such <lb/>coarse approaches-coarse because they use summary statis-<lb/>tics rather than direct mapping-are a promising means to <lb/>identify the presence of small-effect hybrid incompatibilities <lb/>using field experiments. <lb/>In this study, we compare patterns of selection on het-<lb/>erozygosity between F 2 hybrid families raised in the lab to <lb/>those from the same cross types raised in field enclosures. <lb/>If ecological selection on &apos;trait mismatch&apos; (i.e., selection <lb/>favouring &apos;matched&apos; trait values whether parental or some-<lb/>what intermediate) is operating in the field but not in the <lb/>lab, selection for increased ancestry heterozygosity should be <lb/>specific to the field (or at least stronger than in the lab). We <lb/>focus on hybrids between two types of ecologically diver-<lb/>gent threespine stickleback populations. First, we consider <lb/>hybridization between sympatric benthic and limnetic pop-<lb/>ulations. These populations, which are in effect reproduc-<lb/>tively isolated species due to strong assortative mating (Run-<lb/>dle et al. 2000) and reduced hybrid fitness due to extrinsic <lb/>selection pressures (Hatfield and Schluter 1999), comprise <lb/>sympatric species pairs that have evolved independently in at <lb/>least five watersheds in British Columbia, Canada (McKin-<lb/>non and Rundle 2002; McPhail 1992). Although reproduc-<lb/>tively isolated in the wild, the species pairs have no known <lb/>intrinsic barriers that reduce fitness in the lab (Hatfield and <lb/>Schluter 1999). Second, we consider hybridization between <lb/>allopatric populations of anadromous and solitary freshwater <lb/>stickleback. Similarly to the benthic-limnetic species pairs, <lb/>these populations are recently diverged and can readily hy-<lb/>bridize. We pair an analysis of genetic data with a model to <lb/>explore the strength of selection that is necessary to cause <lb/>the observed patterns. Our results provide compelling sup-<lb/>port for the hypothesis that environment-specific hybrid in-<lb/>compatibilities separate recently diverged stickleback popu-<lb/>lations. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Data sources. I used both previously published and unpub-<lb/>lished data in our analyses. Summary information about each <lb/>data source is listed in Table 1. We base our main inference <lb/>on a comparison of ancestry heterozygosity in hybrids raised <lb/>in aquaria to hybrids from the same cross types raised in <lb/>experimental ponds, which are unmanipulated semi-natural <lb/>ecosystems. See Extended Data in Arnegard et al. (2014) for <lb/>additional information about ponds. Pond-raised crosses cap-<lb/>ture both &apos;intrinsic&apos; and &apos;extrinsic&apos; incompatibilities, whereas <lb/>aquarium-raised crosses are expected to capture &apos;intrinsic&apos; in-<lb/>compatibilities that impact hybrid fitness from the embryo to <lb/>adult stage. <lb/>Studies raising fish from the same cross type (benthic <lb/>× limnetic or marine × freshwater) in the same environ-<lb/>ment (aquaria or pond) were pooled for analysis. Two studies <lb/>(Rennison et al., 2019; Schluter et al., 2021) genotyped both <lb/>F 2 and F 3 hybrids, which we analyze together because mean <lb/>ancestry heterozygosity did not differ between generations <lb/>within a study and this choice does not affect our conclu-<lb/>sions (Fig. S1). Similarly, data were analyzed together for <lb/>four studies of benthic × limnetic hybrids from Paxton Lake <lb/>raised in experimental ponds because excess ancestry het-<lb/>erozygosity was statistically indistinguishable among them <lb/>(Fig. S2). This grouping of studies was done only to sim-<lb/>plify the presentation of results-patterns are highly repeat-<lb/>able across replicates and analyses showing results for each <lb/>pond and/or study separately are shown in Fig. S3.

All three lab studies used microsatel-<lb/>lites, whereas the pond studies all used SNPs or GBS. We <lb/>have no reason to believe that differences in methodology <lb/>among studies influence the results presented herein. First, <lb/>we only consider loci where parents have no alleles in com-<lb/>mon and thus can accurately polarize ancestry. Second, we <lb/>only use loci that were heterozygous for ancestry in F 1 s, so <lb/>loci with &apos;null&apos; microsatellites or any difficulties in distin-<lb/>guishing alleles would be filtered out. In the largest mi-<lb/>crosatellite dataset (Rogers et al., 2012), 100 % of loci that <lb/>were different in parents were accurately called as heterozy-<lb/>gous across eight F 1 s (288 of 288 loci across all eight F 1 fish). <lb/>SNP genotypes of the same cross type similarly had 100 % <lb/>heterozygosity in F 1 s (Schluter et al., 2021). We also have <lb/>no reason to suspect any systematic differences in the genetic <lb/>constitution of wild fish (i.e., F 0 s) used to found field vs. lab <lb/>studies. In light of the above, it seems most likely that the <lb/>results presented herein reflect biology rather than methodol-<lb/>ogy. <lb/>One additional difference between the pond and aquar-<lb/>ium studies is that pond F 2 hybrids were a result of natu-<lb/>ral mating whereas aquarium F 2 s were produced via artificial <lb/>crosses. This should not affect our conclusions, however, be-<lb/>cause we only consider loci that were fixed differences be-<lb/>tween F 0 s, and thus are expected to segregate in a 1:2:1 pat-<lb/>tern regardless of the mechanism uniting eggs and sperm. <lb/>Benthic × limnetic crosses. I obtained data from four sources <lb/>for the pond-raised benthic × limnetic hybrids. <lb/>Conte et al. (2015) generated a single F 1 family from <lb/>each of the Priest and Paxton Lake species pairs. Both were <lb/>founded by a single wild benthic female and a limnetic male <lb/>that were collected and crossed in 2009. 35 adult F 1 Paxton <lb/>Lake hybrids and 25 adult F 1 Priest Lake hybrids were re-<lb/>leased into separate ponds where they bred naturally to pro-<lb/>duce F 2 hybrids. F 2 adults were collected over one year later. <lb/>407 F 2 s were genotyped from the Paxton Lake pond, and 324 <lb/>F 2 s were genotyped from the Priest Lake pond. Genotyping <lb/>used a SNP array (Jones et al., 2012), and 246 SNPs were <lb/>found in the Paxton cross, and 318 were found in the Priest <lb/>cross. <lb/>Arnegard et al. (2014) conducted a pond experiment <lb/>with eight F 0 grandparents from Paxton Lake. Two crosses <lb/>used a limnetic female and two crosses used a benthic fe-<lb/>male. Five F 1 males and five F 1 females from each family <lb/>were added to the ponds in March 2008 where they bred nat-<lb/>urally. 633 juvenile F 2 s were collected in October of that <lb/>same year and genotyped at 408 SNPs using the SNP array. <lb/>Bay et al. (2017) genotyped F 2 hybrid females between <lb/>Paxton Lake benthics and limnetics at. Fish are from sev-<lb/>eral crosses and study designs. One used a cross with four <lb/>unique F 0s that were used to produce two F 1 families-one <lb/>with a limnetic as dam and the other with a benthic as dam. <lb/>A second had eight unique F 0 s, where two F 1 crosses were in <lb/>each direction. These two crosses used wild fish collected in <lb/>2007. A third set of crosses was done in 2009, one in each di-<lb/>rection, then the two F 1 families were released into separate <lb/>ponds. Since the goal of the authors&apos; study was to examine <lb/>the genetics of mate choice, a large number of F 2 females <lb/>were genotyped at a small number of microsatellite markers <lb/>to determine whether a genotyped egg or fry was their off-<lb/>spring. 383 F 2 females were identified in this parentage anal-<lb/>ysis and were then genotyped at 494 SNP markers using the <lb/>SNP array. A total of 302 females were assigned to families <lb/>with 10 or more full-sibs (which was necessary for linkage <lb/>mapping), and these 302 females comprise our dataset. <lb/>Finally, Rennison et al. (2019) conducted a study with <lb/>four unique Paxton Lake benthic × limnetic F 1 hybrid fam-<lb/>ilies that were each split between two ponds. One pond in <lb/>each pair contained a cutthroat trout predator (heterozygosity <lb/>did not differ across pond types and data are pooled across <lb/>all pairs and pond types). Wild fish were caught in 2011 and <lb/>F 1 s were released in 2012. Fish bred naturally and juvenile <lb/>F 2 s were sampled in September of that same year. F 3 hybrids <lb/>were collected in September 2013. 50 fish from each pond <lb/>and hybrid generation were genotyped at 2243 SNPs using <lb/>restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (genotyping-by-<lb/>sequencing). <lb/>The Paxton and Priest Lake laboratory cross data are <lb/>original to this study. Crosses used a single wild-caught ben-<lb/>thic female fish and a single wild-caught limnetic male fish <lb/>as F 0 progenitors. Wild fish were crossed in 2003. Sibling <lb/>mating of F 1 hybrids was used to produce a single F 2 hybrid <lb/>family for analysis, and fish were raised in glass aquaria and <lb/>fed ad libitum. 92 Priest Lake F 2 s were genotyped at 85 mi-<lb/>crosatellite markers, and 86 Paxton Lake F 2 s were genotyped <lb/>at 216 microsatellite markers. <lb/>Marine × freshwater crosses. Schluter et al. (2021) con-<lb/>ducted a pond experiment with anadromous (hereafter simply <lb/>&apos;marine&apos;) × freshwater hybrids. This study crossed a marine <lb/>female from the Little Campbell River, BC, with a freshwa-<lb/>ter male from Cranby Lake, BC. Over 600 juvenile F 2 hy-<lb/>brids were introduced into the ponds directly in August 2006. <lb/>F 2 s were produced from six F 1 families-six unique females <lb/></body>

			<body>were crossed with four males (one male was crossed twice). <lb/>F 2 s overwintered with an estimated over-winter survival rate <lb/>of approximately 86 % (from mark-recapture). (Simulations <lb/>designed to mimic the experimental design, mortality, and <lb/>sub-sampling procedures indicate that 86 % survivorship, <lb/>if caused by viability selection on hybrid incompatibilities, <lb/>leads to a mean heterozygosity value of 51.8 % ± 0.5 [SD]; <lb/>not shown.) In spring 2007, surviving F 2 s bred and were <lb/>genotyped at 1,294 biallelic SNP markers using a SNP array. <lb/>500 of their F 3 hybrid offspring were collected in October <lb/>2007 and were genotyped with the same methodology. <lb/>The data for the laboratory comparison to the Schluter <lb/>et al. (2021) data were originally published by Rogers et al. <lb/>(2012). The population used a single Little Campbell River <lb/>female as the F 0 dam and a single Cranby Lake male as the <lb/>F 0 sire. Wild adult fish were captured in 2001 to generate <lb/>a single F 1 hybrid family. Four F 2 crosses were made from <lb/>individuals from this F 1 family (eight F 1 parents total) for a <lb/>total of 374 genotyped F 2 s. Fish were genotyped at 96 mi-<lb/>crosatellite markers. <lb/>Marker filtering and estimating heterozygosity. For <lb/>each dataset, we restricted our analysis to loci where the F 0 <lb/>progenitors of a given F 2 family had no alleles in common <lb/>(e.g., all BB in benthic F 0 s and all LL in limnetic F 0 s) and <lb/>where all F 1 hybrids were heterozygous for ancestry. GBS <lb/>data were filtered to 20× coverage. Final sample sizes of <lb/>fish and markers are given in Table 1. In all cases, the sex <lb/>chromosome (chromosome 19) was not analyzed. <lb/>Because some studies have more individuals than loci, <lb/>and others have more loci than individuals, we analyze ances-<lb/>try heterozygosity both in individuals (averaged across loci) <lb/>and at loci (averaged across individuals). We retained indi-<lb/>viduals for which at least 20 loci were genotyped, and re-<lb/>tained loci for which at least 20 individuals were genotyped. <lb/>Differences in genotyping success and/or family structure <lb/>caused the number of genotyped loci to differ among indi-<lb/>viduals for a given study. <lb/>Deviation from 50:50 ancestry proportion, via direc-<lb/>tional selection against one ancestry or via segregation distor-<lb/>tion, reduce the expected heterozygosity below 50 %. To ac-<lb/>count for this, we and base our main inference on estimates of <lb/>excess heterozygosity. Excess heterozygosity was calculated <lb/>as observed heterozygosity (p AB ) minus expected heterozy-<lb/>gosity (2p A p B , where p A and p B are the frequencies of both <lb/>ancestries at the locus or in the individual&apos;s genome). Our <lb/>conclusions are unchanged, however, if an uncorrected &apos;ob-<lb/>served&apos; heterozygosity is used as the response variable (Fig. <lb/>S4) or if the expected heterozygosity is adjusted for sample <lb/>size (i.e., multiplying by 2N <lb/>2N −1 following Irwin et al. 2018). <lb/>Data analysis. I evaluated whether excess heterozygosity <lb/>differed between crosses using linear models. We first used <lb/>simple t-tests to evaluate whether heterozygosity differed <lb/>from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation (i.e., whether excess <lb/>heterozygosity was significantly different from 0). To avoid <lb/>basing conclusions on such indirect comparisons, we also <lb/>compared aquarium and pond studies directly using linear <lb/>models. Linear models had excess heterozygosity-of in-<lb/>dividuals or loci-as the response variable and environment <lb/>(lab or pond) as a categorical predictor. For the benthic × <lb/>limnetic data, &apos;lake&apos; was included as a second categorical <lb/>predictor. A lake × environment interaction term was non-<lb/>significant and was omitted from the final model. Thus, two <lb/>models were run: one for the benthic × limnetic cross type, <lb/>and another for the marine × freshwater cross type. <lb/>Heuristic model. I used a simple heuristic model to infer the <lb/>strength of selection on incompatibilities that is sufficient to <lb/>cause the observed excess heterozygosity. We assume that <lb/>incompatibilities only act between pairs of loci and that fit-<lb/>ness is based only on the genotype of individual F 2 hybrids. <lb/>There is no directional selection and fitness is not frequency-<lb/>or density-dependent. We consider all possible pairs of in-<lb/>compatible loci such that each locus can be incompatible with <lb/>each other one. <lb/>I consider two broad incompatibility architectures, re-<lb/>cessive and additive. The recessive model assumes that only <lb/>loci with opposite homozygous ancestry (i.e., homozygous <lb/>at one locus for BB and at the other locus for LL) interact, <lb/>whereas the additive model allows heterozygous loci to be <lb/>involved in incompatibilities. The additive model is symmet-<lb/>ric (i.e., which allele is at which locus does not matter) for <lb/>simplicity and because it is plausible that populations could <lb/>cross shallow fitness valleys such as those that might typi-<lb/>cally underlie individual ecological incompatibilities. <lb/>The models simply sum the count of each incompatibil-<lb/>ity type, and additively penalize the individual&apos;s fitness ac-<lb/>cording to s-the selection coefficient acting against incom-<lb/>patibilities of opposite homozygous ancestries (i.e., BB-LL <lb/>or FF-MM incompatibilities). For simplicity we use notation <lb/>of benthic (&apos;B&apos;) and limnetic (&apos;L&apos;) ancestries, but this is ar-<lb/>bitrary and one could substitute marine or freshwater. We <lb/>assume the strength of incompatibilities involving heterozy-<lb/>gous loci is half of that involving only homozygous loci (see <lb/>below). The selection coefficient, s, can be interpreted as <lb/>the reduction in fitness caused by individual incompatibili-<lb/>ties. For example, an s value of 0.002 implies that each BB-<lb/>LL or FF-MM incompatibility reduces an individual&apos;s fitness <lb/>by 0.2 %. <lb/>For a case where all incompatibilities are assumed to be <lb/>recessive, the fitness of an individual hybrid is calculated as: <lb/>W i = 1 − n 2 • p BB • p LL • s, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where W i is the fitness of the i th individual F 2 hybrid, n is <lb/>the number of unlinked loci, p BB &amp; p LL are the frequencies <lb/>of homozygous ancestries among genotyped loci (here ben-<lb/>thic or limnetic, but could also be marine and freshwater), <lb/>and s is the selection coefficient acting against each BB-LL <lb/>or FF-MM incompatibility. If an individual has 4 loci where <lb/>ancestry is 1 × BB, 1 × LL, and 2 × BL, this individual <lb/>has one possible pairwise incompatibility-the lone BB lo-<lb/>cus with the lone LL locus. If the individual has 5 loci with <lb/>ancestries 2 × BB, 1 × LL, and 2 × BL, this individual has <lb/>2 pairwise incompatibilities-each BB with the lone LL. The <lb/></body>

			<body>fitness of a given individual is reduced by a given amount, s, <lb/>for each incompatibility, so fitness in the first former case is <lb/>1 − s and fitness in the latter case is 1 − 2s. We assume fitness <lb/>is linear for simplicity, but note that this causes the model to <lb/>return negative fitness values and thus fail under extended pa-<lb/>rameter combinations. <lb/>I next consider an additive model where heterozygous <lb/>loci interact with homozygous loci to influence hybrid fitness. <lb/>For systems where niche divergence is additive, as it likely is <lb/>in threespine stickleback (Arnegard et al., 2014), an additive <lb/>model might be more realistic than a recessive one. Under <lb/>the additive model, an individual&apos;s fitness is calculated as: <lb/>W i = 1−n 2 •p BB •p LL •s−(n 2 •p BB •p BL +n 2 •p LL •p BL )• <lb/>s <lb/>2 <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where terms are as in Eqn. 1, and p BL is the frequency of loci <lb/>with heterozygous ancestry. The first term in the equation <lb/>quantifies homozygote-homozygote incompatibilities (i.e., <lb/>those between BB and LL), and the second term quanti-<lb/>fies homozygote-heterozygote incompatibilities (i.e., those <lb/>between BB and BL &amp; LL and BL). This model assumes <lb/>that the strength of selection on homozygous-heterozygous <lb/>incompatibilities is half that acting on incompatibilities be-<lb/>tween loci of opposite homozygous ancestry. Consider again <lb/>an individual with four loci, with 1:2:1 BB:BL:LL frequen-<lb/>cies. The individual has 1 homozygote-homozygote incom-<lb/>patibility (BB-LL) and four heterozygote incompatibilities <lb/>(BB-BL 1 , LL-BL 2 , LL-BL 1 , LL-BL 2 ). <lb/>I used this heuristic model as the basis of simple sim-<lb/>ulations to evaluate the connection between the above fit-<lb/>ness functions and observed patterns of excess heterozygos-<lb/>ity. These simulations interpret fitness from Eqns. 1 &amp; 2 as <lb/>survival probability. In simulations, we assumed that F 1 hy-<lb/>brid stickleback typically have between 1 and 1.5 recombina-<lb/>tion events per chromosome (2n chromosomes = 42; Roesti <lb/>et al. 2013), and therefore assume that F 2 hybrids inherit <lb/>50 unlinked haplotype blocks (hereafter referred to as the <lb/>50 genotyped &apos;loci&apos;; approximately 1.2 recombination events <lb/>per chromosome). We generated individuals with 50 loci <lb/>where each locus had a 25 % probability of having ancestry <lb/>&apos;BB&apos;, a 25 % probability of having &apos;LL&apos;, and a 50 % proba-<lb/>bility of being heterozygous, &apos;BL&apos; (i.e., by sampling one of <lb/>&apos;BB&apos;, &apos;BL&apos;, &apos;BL&apos;, &apos;LL&apos; with equal probability for each locus). <lb/>We calculated each individual&apos;s fitness under both Eqns. 1 <lb/>and 2 then implemented probabilistic selective mortality ac-<lb/>cording to an individual&apos;s predicted fitness (using random <lb/>numbers). Finally, we recorded the mean excess heterozy-<lb/>gosity of survivors. We repeat these simulations for various <lb/>values of s to determine the strength of selection against in-<lb/>compatibilities that returns estimates of excess heterozygos-<lb/>ity that match those in the empirical data. As noted above, <lb/>we assume incompatibilities only act between pairs of loci <lb/>(i.e. they are digenic rather than trigenic, etc.) even though <lb/>trigenic interactions have been shown to be be more common <lb/>than digenic ones in yeast (Kuzmin et al. 2018). Therefore, <lb/>the resulting estimates of the minimum s required to observe <lb/>a given amount of heterozygosity could be overestimates. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Patterns of excess heterozygosity. I begin this section by <lb/>evaluating patterns of excess heterozygosity in aquaria and <lb/>ponds separately for both benthic × limnetic and marine × <lb/>freshwater crosses. We then make a direct comparison be-<lb/>tween these two environments sing linear models. Conclu-<lb/>sions are consistent between approaches. <lb/>Aquarium-raised crosses. Mean individual excess heterozy-<lb/>gosity was not significantly different from zero in any <lb/>aquarium-raised stickleback cross (see left side [red] of pan-<lb/>els in Fig. 2). Specifically, t-tests evaluating whether excess <lb/>heterozygosity was significantly different from zero failed to <lb/>reject the null hypothesis for both benthic × limnetic crosses <lb/>(mean &amp; 95 % CI Paxton Lake-β = 0.014 [−0.010, 0.037], <lb/>t 88 = 1.16, P = 0.25; Priest Lake-β = 0.0098 [−0.014, <lb/>0.034], t 89 = 0.81, P = 0.42). The aquarium-raised ma-<lb/>rine × freshwater cross was similar (β = −0.0047 [−0.013, <lb/>0.00396], t 373 = 0.28, P = 0.28). <lb/>The lack of excess heterozygosity in aquaria is not sur-<lb/>prising given what is known about &apos;intrinsic&apos; hybrid incom-<lb/>patibilities in stickleback. Previous studies of benthic × lim-<lb/>netic hybrids have found no evidence for intrinsic inviability <lb/>in F 2 benthic × limnetic stickleback crosses, either in embryo <lb/>development and hatching success (Hatfield and Schluter, <lb/>1999; McPhail, 1984, 1992) or lifetime fitness (Hatfield and <lb/>Schluter, 1999). In a recent review summarising the literature <lb/>on reproductive isolation in threespine stickleback, Lackey <lb/>and Boughman (2017) report that &apos;intrinsic&apos; barriers are typ-<lb/>ically weak to nonexistent. Both marine (i.e., anadromous) <lb/>× freshwater and benthic × limnetic crosses had no evidence <lb/>for intrinsic inviability whereas the authors found evidence <lb/>for hybrid ecological inviability in both systems (Lackey and <lb/>Boughman, 2017). <lb/>Pond-raised crosses. Mean individual excess heterozygosity <lb/>exceeded zero in each pond-raised cross (see right side [blue] <lb/>of panels in Fig. 2). This was the case for both Paxton and <lb/>Priest Lake hybrids for the benthic × limnetic crosses (mean <lb/>&amp; 95 % CI Paxton Lake-β = 0.029 [−0.024, 0.033], t 2222 <lb/>= 13.16, P &lt; 0.0001; Priest Lake-β = 0.039 [0.029, 0.048], <lb/>t 411 , P &lt; 0.0001), as well as the marine × freshwater cross (β <lb/>= 0.034 [0.027, 0.041], t 722 = 9.33, P &lt; 0.0001). Simulations <lb/>of genotyping error-where all errors are assumed to have re-<lb/>sulted in true homozygotes being called as heterozygotes-<lb/>indicate that error rates in excess of 5% are necessary to <lb/>cause this pattern. Given we detected 0 % false heterozygos-<lb/>ity calls in F 1 hybrids, this error rate is unrealistically high. <lb/>Down-sampling all individuals to have exactly 20 genotyped <lb/>loci indicates that our main effects are robust to differences <lb/>in genotyping effort. Although there was significant hetero-<lb/>geneity among linkage groups, the signal of excess ancestry <lb/>heterozygosity is widespread throughout the genome (Fig. ). <lb/>Thus, there is support for the hypothesis the ecological con-<lb/>ditions in ponds result in increased ancestry heterozygosity <lb/>among surviving individuals. <lb/></body>

We evaluated the difference between aquarium-and <lb/>pond-raised crosses using simple linear models. For the ben-<lb/>thic × limnetic crosses, we used a linear model where lake <lb/>(Paxton or Priest), environment (aquaria or pond), and their <lb/>interaction, were predictors. The interaction term was non-<lb/>significant and was dropped leaving the two main effects. <lb/>We found that individual mean excess heterozygosity was 2.2 <lb/>% higher in pond-raised benthic × limnetic hybrids than in <lb/>aquarium-raised hybrids ( β = 0.022 ± 0.0083 [SE; units are <lb/>heterozygote frequency], F 1,2509 = 6.89, P = 0.0087) (Fig. <lb/>2A; also see Fig S6 for plots of individual hybrid index and <lb/>heterozygosity). The &apos;lake&apos; term was non-significant (P = <lb/>0.11). For the marine × freshwater crosses, we found that <lb/>individual mean excess heterozygosity was 3.9 % higher in <lb/>pond-raised fish than in aquarium-raised fish ( β = 0.039 ± <lb/>0.0059 [SE], F 1,1095 = 41.88, P = 1.46 ×10 −10 ) (Fig. 2B). <lb/>We repeated these analyses using loci as the unit of repli-<lb/>cation, rather than individuals, and found virtually identical <lb/>patterns to the analysis of individuals (Fig. 2C&amp;D; Fig S7). <lb/>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hybrid <lb/>incompatibilities act more strongly in the wild than in the lab <lb/>and implies that individuals with a greater number of incom-<lb/>patibilities are more likely to die than those with fewer. <lb/>Heuristic model. Analysis of the heuristic model revealed <lb/>that, as expected, fitness (W) is lower when incompatibili-<lb/>ties act additively rather than recessively (compare black and <lb/>grey lines in Fig. 3B) and when F 2 individuals are more ho-<lb/>mozygous (compare dashed to solid lines in Fig. 3B). We <lb/>used simulations of selective mortality to estimate the per-<lb/>incompatibility s value that is sufficient to generate 3 % ex-<lb/>cess heterozygosity, which is the mean lab-pond difference of <lb/>the two crosses.

For the recessive <lb/>model, we found that we observed a mean of 3 % excess het-<lb/>erozygosity when s ≥ 0.0036. Under the additive model, we <lb/>found that mean 3 % excess heterozygosity resulted when s <lb/>≥ 0.0017. These results imply that if each two-way incom-<lb/>patibility reduces survival probability only by 0.0036 (i.e., <lb/>0.36 %) under a recessive model, or 0.0017 (i.e., 0.17%) un-<lb/>der an additive incompatibility model (assuming 50 loci), this <lb/>would be sufficient to cause the observed patterns of excess <lb/>heterozygosity. <lb/>Alternative explanations for excess heterozygosity. <lb/>Although we framed our predictions on the hypothesis of hy-<lb/>brid incompatibilities, several other mechanisms could pos-<lb/>sibly underlie the observed pattern of excess heterozygosity. <lb/>These alternative mechanisms-heterosis and dominance-<lb/>involve processes operating at single loci rather than interac-<lb/>tions among loci. Ultimately, the data cannot directly dis-<lb/>tinguish between single-locus processes like heterosis and <lb/>multi-locus processes like incompatibilities, so indirect in-<lb/>ference is required to evaluate the plausibility of causal pro-<lb/>cesses. <lb/>Heterosis refers to the case where heterozygosity at a <lb/>given locus is favoured per se, rather than as a means to es-<lb/>cape incompatibilities caused by interactions involving ho-<lb/>mozygous alleles. Typically, heterosis is caused by the dom-<lb/>inance of a fit allele over a less fit one (though additive <lb/>heterosis is possible). If individual loci were overdomi-<lb/>nant only under field conditions, then excess heterozygosity <lb/>could result without any interactions among loci. In the ben-<lb/>thic × limnetic crosses, this possibility can be disregarded <lb/>based on prior knowledge about hybrid fitness in this sys-<lb/>tem. If heterosis were common, then hybrids should have <lb/>higher fitness than parents. However, F 1 and reciprocal back-<lb/>cross hybrids-which are highly heterozygous-have lower <lb/>growth and/or survival than both parent taxa in field exper-<lb/>iments (Hatfield and Schluter 1999; Rundle 2002; Vamosi <lb/>et al. 2000). In the lab, F 1 hybrid growth rate matches the <lb/>additive expectation of parents (Hatfield, 1997; Hatfield and <lb/>Schluter, 1999). These patterns should not occur if hetero-<lb/>sis was a general feature of benthic-limnetic crosses. Less is <lb/>known about heterosis in marine × freshwater crosses. Fur-<lb/>ther evidence against heterosis comes from the fact that there <lb/>is no relationship between body size and heterozygosity in <lb/>the lab in any cross (Fig. S8; family sizes are too small for a <lb/>robust analysis in ponds). Thus, heterosis seems an unlikely <lb/>explanation underlying selection for heterozygosity in stick-<lb/>leback hybrids. <lb/>Patterns of excess heterozygosity could also be caused <lb/>by directional selection and/or dominance. If heterozygotes <lb/>were just as likely to survive as the favoured homozygote, <lb/>this would lead to a higher observed heterozygosity than ex-<lb/>pected (i.e., &gt;2p A p B ) for loci that are under directional se-<lb/>lection. We quantified the strength of directional selection on <lb/>each locus as |p AA − p BB |, the absolute difference between <lb/>the frequencies of both homozygotes. Loci under strong di-<lb/>rectional selection should have larger values. If dominance <lb/></body>

			<body>was common, then excess heterozygosity should be greater at <lb/>loci that are under stronger directional selection. We find that <lb/>the excess heterozygosity of loci is not correlated with this <lb/>metric of directional selection in either pond-raised benthic <lb/>× limnetic hybrids nor marine × freshwater hybrids (both P <lb/>&gt; 0.15; Fig. S9). Although we do observe directional selec-<lb/>tion for a particular ancestry across loci (i.e., significant shifts <lb/>in mean hybrid index toward benthic and toward freshwater), <lb/>simulations indicate that observing 3 % excess heterozygos-<lb/>ity in a case where the deviation in hybrid index is ±0.7 % <lb/>(our observed deviation from 50%) is highly unlikely (i.e., <lb/>considerably below 1%; Fig. SX). Moreover, the fact that <lb/>F 1 benthic × limnetic hybrids have lower fitness than both <lb/>parents in field conditions suggests that neither parent har-<lb/>bours an appreciable degree of extrinsically deleterious alle-<lb/>les. Thus, we conclude that the dominance of beneficial alle-<lb/>les alone is unlikely explain the observed patterns of excess <lb/>heterozygosity. <lb/>Next steps. To the extent that this study documents the ex-<lb/>istence of environment-specific hybrid incompatibilities, it <lb/>cannot identify their underlying mechanisms. Experiments <lb/>that directly manipulate individual phenotypes, or their inter-<lb/>actions with the environment, are needed to establish such <lb/>causality. Such studies represent an exciting new frontier for <lb/>empirical research into the mechanisms of ecological specia-<lb/>tion. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The main result of this study is that heterozygosity was ele-<lb/>vated in F 2 stickleback hybrids raised in the field compared <lb/>to those raised in aquaria. Because single-locus processes <lb/>such as heterosis and dominance are unlikely to explain this <lb/>pattern, we suggest that hybrid incompatibilities are the most <lb/>likely causal mechanism. Selection on a per-incompatibility <lb/>basis need not be terribly strong to cause levels of excess <lb/>heterozygosity similar to what we observed, though stronger <lb/>selection on fewer incompatibilities could also give rise to <lb/>a similar pattern. This finding has implications for our un-<lb/>derstanding of the genetics of extrinsic reproductive isola-<lb/>tion. At least for the benthic × limnetic crosses, it is well-<lb/>established that the species are reproductively isolated and <lb/>hybrids perform worse than parents under field conditions. <lb/>Thus, hybrid incompatibilities might underlie extrinsic post-<lb/>zygotic isolation in this classic case of &apos;ecological speciation&apos; <lb/>(McKinnon and Rundle, 2002). Moreover, the analysis gives <lb/>insight into the number of genes that might underlie speci-<lb/>ation. The data presented here suggests that many genes of <lb/>small effect (i.e., where their interactions reduce fitness by <lb/>considerably less than 1 %), located throughout the genome, <lb/>underlie reproductive isolation between ecologically diver-<lb/>gent populations of threespine stickleback. <lb/>This study used crosses with different F 0 progenitors, <lb/>genotyped with different methodologies, for its main com-<lb/>parison. Although this is less than ideal, there is no obvi-<lb/>ous mechanism that would cause the lab-raised fish to ex-<lb/>hibit significant excess ancestry heterozygosity. In light of <lb/>this, a valid though less conservative approach would simply <lb/>have tested if pond-raised crosses exhibit excess ancestry het-<lb/>erozygosity, which they almost invariably do (Fig. S3). That <lb/>is, we view the fact that ancestry heterozygosity is elevated <lb/>beyond neutral expectations in ponds, rather than the fact that <lb/>it differs between environments, as the novel result of this <lb/>article. The fact that this pattern-excess heterozygosity in <lb/>pond-raised hybrids-repeats across so many pond experi-<lb/>ments from different years, might be seen as an even stronger <lb/>conclusion than one based on a single comparison in a single <lb/>year. In sum, the evidence presented here is consistent with <lb/>the hypothesis that extrinsic hybrid incompatibilities underlie <lb/>extrinsic post-zygotic isolation in this system. <lb/></body>

We used simple simulations in Figure 1 of the main text to illustrate the mechanistic relationship between trait <lb/>mismatch and heterozygosity. Similar results have been noted elsewhere ((Simon et al., 2018)) but I give my detailed methods <lb/>herein. We consider the following life history: a single population adapts to a novel environment and then hybridizes with the <lb/>ancestral population. The phenotype and genotype (hybrid index and heterozygosity) are recorded for F 2 hybrids. <lb/>We use the framework of Fisher&apos;s (1930) geometric model, wherein the phenotype of an organism is a vector of m traits, <lb/>z = [z 1 , z 2 ..., z m ]. For simplicity, we only consider m = 2. We assume that mutations are sufficiently rare that they individually <lb/>sweep through an otherwise monomorphic population. We also assume that mutations all occur at unique loci with free recom-<lb/>bination among them (i.e., no linkage) (Kimura, 1965, 1969). Mutations influence the phenotype additively, and are vectors of <lb/>length m where values are drawn from a random normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of α (α = 0.15). <lb/>The fitness of a given population is calculated as w = exp(−σ||z − o|| 2 ), where ||z − o|| is the Euclidean distance between the <lb/>populations current phenotype (z) and the optimum (o), and sigma is the strength of selection (σ = 10). The original phenotype <lb/>of the population is z 0 = [0, 0] and the optimum phenotype is z opt = [1, 1]. The selection coefficient s value when they arise, <lb/>where s = wmut /wwt − 1. The probability that a given mutation fixes, π, is calculated as π = 1 − exp(−2N sp) /1 − exp(−2N s), where <lb/>N is the effective population size (N = 1000), p is the frequency of the mutation in the population (p = 1 ⁄N), and s is the selection <lb/>coefficient. <lb/>We allow 1000 mutations to arise in our simulations, which is sufficient for the adapting population to reach the optimum. <lb/>After adaptation, we simulation hybridization with the ancestral population (which contains no mutations and has a value of <lb/>0 for both traits). We generate 500 F 2 hybrids, which inherit homozygous ancestral, heterozygous, or homozygous derived <lb/>ancestry at each locus with probabilities 0.25:0.5:0.25. The genotype of these hybrids determines their phenotype for both <lb/>traits; these phenotypes are plotted in Fig. ??A. We consider two orthogonal properties of the phenotype: hybrid index and <lb/>heterozygosity. Hybrid index is the fraction of alleles an individual inherited from the derived parent, and heterozygosity is the <lb/>fraction of loci that are heterozygous. We finally calculated the Euclidean phenotypic distance from each hybrid&apos;s phenotype <lb/>to the line connecting parents using the dist2d function in the R package &apos;funModeling&apos; (?). This distance is the individual <lb/>hybrid&apos;s &apos;mismatch&apos; as calculated elsewhere (Thompson et al., 2021). <lb/>Genotyping of lab-raised benthic × limnetic hybrids <lb/>Ninety-two F2s from the Priest Lake cross were genotyped at 84 microsatellite markers, and 86 F2s from the Paxton Lake cross <lb/>were genotyped at 216 microsatellite markers following Peichel et al. (2001). We constructed a combined linkage map between <lb/>the two families using the map integration function in JoinMap 3.0 (Van Ooijen and Voorrips, 2001). The average centiMorgan <lb/>(cM) distance between the markers in the Priest Lake and Paxton Lake maps was 15.6 ± 1.85, and 4.5 ± 0.51 (mean ± 1 SE) <lb/>respectively. <lb/></div>
