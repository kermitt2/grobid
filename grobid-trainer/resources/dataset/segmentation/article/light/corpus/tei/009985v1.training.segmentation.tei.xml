			<front>Understanding the persistence of specialists and generalists within ecological communities is a topical <lb/>research question, with far-reaching consequences for the maintenance of functional diversity. Although <lb/>theoretical studies indicate that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve co-occurrence of spe-<lb/>cialists and generalists, analyses of larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the perva-<lb/>siveness of coexistence. In this paper, we analyze 175 ecological bipartite networks of three interaction <lb/>types (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator), and measure the extent to which these <lb/>communities are composed of species with different levels of specificity in their biotic interactions. We <lb/>find a continuum from specialism to generalism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that diversity tends to be <lb/>greatest in networks with intermediate connectance, and argue this is because of physical constraints in <lb/>the filling of networks. <lb/>Keywords: bipartite networks; specificity; nestedness; modularity; food webs; parasites; pollinators; <lb/>herbivores <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The functional diversity of ecological communities emerges through the simultaneous occurrence of <lb/>species with contrasted resource use [1], habitat selection [2], and interactions [3,4]. Both empirical and <lb/>theoretical studies have shown how different degrees of niche partitioning can promote functional diver-<lb/>sity [5-7] and species persistence [8]. However, the co-occurrence of specialist and generalist species <lb/>has received considerably less attention. The majority of studies seeking to understand the conditions <lb/>for co-occurrence between populations of specialists and generalists in both biotic (e.g. predator-prey, <lb/>host-parasite) and abiotic (e.g. habitat choice) interactions have focused on small communities [9-14]. <lb/>Approaches based on model analysis or controlled experiments have two features impeding their gener-<lb/>alization to large communities. First, the number of interacting organisms is often kept low, to facilitate <lb/>model analysis or because of experimental constraints. Studies investigating the co-occurrence of species <lb/>with contrasted specificities assume no intermediate situations between the endpoints of specialism and <lb/>generalism, whereas natural systems exhibit a continuum [15,16]. Second, it is unclear to what extent <lb/>results can be scaled up to more realistic communities. Stouffer and colleagues [17] showed that because <lb/>adding species and interactions increases the potential for complex population dynamical feedbacks, <lb/>complete, realistic networks tend to exhibit different behaviors than simple modules (i.e. those typically <lb/>used in models or experiments), begging for an analysis of co-occurrence in empirical communities. <lb/>Network theory offers powerful tools to describe ecological communities [18] and the distribution of <lb/>species specificity within them [19]. In a species interaction network, each species is a node, and each in-<lb/>teraction is an edge, connecting a pair of nodes. From a network perspective, one can measure specificity <lb/>by counting the number of links it has with other species (its degree), or by measuring aspects of the <lb/>distribution of the strengths of such links [19]. Previous work described the degree distribution (i.e. the <lb/>distribution of how many interactions each species establishes and receives) of empirical networks, and <lb/>revealed a continuum from highly specialized to generalists species [20]. While much is known about the <lb/>factors (e.g. biotic [21], abiotic [14,15], developmental and physiological [22]) driving the specialization <lb/>of single species, less is known about the spectrum of specificities and niche-overlaps that can co-occur <lb/>in large ecological networks, and reasons for different spectra. As the co-occurrence and interactions <lb/></body>

			<body>between specialized and generalized species is key to maintaining functional diversity [23], promoting <lb/>community stability [24], and ensuring network persistence [3], there is a need to investigate the extent <lb/>and properties of this co-occurrence. <lb/>Network 1 <lb/>Network 2 <lb/>Network 3 <lb/>Connectance <lb/>Specificity <lb/>Div. of strat. <lb/>Minimal <lb/>Maximal <lb/>None <lb/>Medium <lb/>Medium <lb/>High <lb/>Maximal <lb/>Minimal <lb/>None <lb/>Shape <lb/>Modular <lb/>Nested <lb/>-<lb/>Figure 1: Expected relationships between connectance and other metrics. <lb/>In a previous paper [1], we argued that the specialisation of different types of interactions is likely to be <lb/>shaped by the same set of core mechanisms, expressed in a different ways or with different intensities. <lb/>At the community level, this leads to the expectation that the same relationships between specificity, the <lb/>co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, and other metrics of community structure would occure for <lb/>different types of ecological interactions, despite different types of networks, dominated by positive or <lb/>negative interactions, occupying different parts of this gradient [25]. In this study, we use a dataset of <lb/>interaction networks spanning three contrasted types of ecological interactions (herbivory, parasitism, and <lb/>mutualism), to characterize the extent to which species with different specificities can co-occur within <lb/>the same community. In line with our expectation and past empirical data, we find a continuum from <lb/>networks of mostly-specialized to mostly-generalized species, with the potential for specialist/generalist <lb/>co-occurrence being greater at intermediate connectance. One central result is that empirical data show <lb/>consistently more variation in specificities of all species on the upper network level (parasites, herbivores, <lb/>pollinators; hereafter called &quot;strategy diversity&quot;) than predicted by two contrasting null models. This <lb/>suggests (i) that organisms with very different levels of specificity can co-occur in most natural systems, <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>and (ii) that ecological or evolutionary mechanisms are acting to maintain high diversity in the range of <lb/>1 <lb/>specificities. <lb/>2 <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Datasets <lb/>We employ three datasets: two for antagonistic (ectoparasite-animal host and insect herbivore-plant) in-<lb/>teractions, and one for mutualistic (pollinator-plant) interactions. Parasitism networks were from Stanko <lb/>and colleagues [26,27] and consist of 121 networks of ectoparasites infecting rodents in Central Eu-<lb/>rope, collected in a range of continental ecosystems over a period of 19 years. Herbivory networks (a <lb/>total of 23) were collected by Thébault and Fontaine [25] from various literature records. Data on mu-<lb/>tualistic interactions are the 29 &quot;plant-pollinators&quot; networks deposited in the InteractionWeb database <lb/>(http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/interactionweb/) as of May 2012. These data are insect-plant con-<lb/>tacts, aggregated from different sources, spanning a period of over 30 years. Species with no interaction <lb/>were removed from the original datasets. Some networks had less than 1000 possible randomizations, <lb/>which did not allow for efficient or meaningful randomisation [28], and as such were discarded from the <lb/>analysis. The final dataset has 115 parasitism networks, 6 herbivory networks, and 12 pollination net-<lb/>works. Because the sample size is unbalanced, we put particular emphasis on the discussion of parasitism <lb/>networks. <lb/>Network analyses <lb/>Each bipartite network is represented by its adjacency matrix M with T rows (for the upper level, i.e. <lb/>ectoparasites, herbivores, and pollinators) and L columns (for the lower level, i.e. animal hosts and plants <lb/>being consumed or pollinated). In each network, M i j represents the existence of an interaction between <lb/>species i and species j [29]. For each network, we calculate its size (Z = L × T ), and connectance (Co, <lb/>the proportion of established interactions). We focus our analyses on the upper level, since we have <lb/>more knowledge of specialization mechanisms for these organisms [30]. Nestedness, a measure that <lb/>reflects whether specialist species interact with the same species as generalists, is calculated using the <lb/>NODF (Nestedness based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill) measure [31]. NODF is insensitive to net-<lb/>work asymetry (the relative number of species at each of the two levels) and size. Modularity measures <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>the extent to which species form well defined, densely connected, groups, with few connections between <lb/>groups. Modularity is estimated using the LP-BRIM method [32], which both increases detection com-<lb/>pared to the adaptive BRIM method, and is less computationally intensive [33]. For each network, we <lb/>retained the highest modularity Q bip [34] observed in a total of 1000 replicate runs. <lb/>We contrast empirical observations with the predictions of two different null models, each based on the <lb/>impact of different aspects of network structure. For each null model, we filled a network through a <lb/>Bernoulli process, in which the probability of each pairwise species interaction occurring (P i j ) is deter-<lb/>mined in one of the following ways. Null model I [35] is connectance based and assigns the same prob-<lb/>ability to each interaction, P i j = Co. Compared to the empirical network on which they are based, simu-<lb/>lated networks can have the same connectance, but a potentially different degree distribution. Null model <lb/>II [3] uses information about species degree (the number of interactions established/received) to calculate <lb/>the probability that a particular interaction will occur. This probability is P i j = (T × G i + L ×V j )/(2 × Z), <lb/>where G i and V j are, respectively, the generality (number of interactions) of upper level species i, and the <lb/>vulnerability (number of interactions) of lower level species j [36]. Simply put, the probability of the <lb/>interaction occurring is the mean of the degrees (ranged in 0-1) of the two species involved. Note that <lb/>the first null model is nested into the second. <lb/>Each of these models was applied to each network in the dataset, so as to generate 1000 random networks <lb/>(meaning that each empirical network was fed into the model to generate a total of 2000 randomizations). <lb/>Each of these networks was analyzed using the same methods as for empirical networks. <lb/>Quantifying specificity <lb/>We quantify specificity based on the proportion of available species with which a focal species interacts <lb/>[37], using a ranged version of Schoener&apos;s generality. For each species i of the upper level (e.g. parasites), <lb/>its specificity is given by <lb/>s i = L−l i <lb/>L−1 <lb/>where L is the number of lower level species (e.g. hosts) found in the network, and l i is the number of <lb/>interaction partners of species i. The vector s is the distribution of specificities at the network scale . <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Values of 1 indicate complete specialism (single partner), and values of 0 indicate complete generalism <lb/>(all possible partners). <lb/>Quantifying strategy diversity <lb/>We quantify two aspects of the co-occurrence of specialists and generalists (i.e. &quot;strategy diversity&quot;). <lb/>First, &quot;specificity range&quot; or R, is simply the difference between the specificity of the most and least <lb/>specialized organisms, such that <lb/>R = max(s) − min(s) <lb/>R is maximized when at least one completely specialized species k (s k = 1) is found in the same network <lb/>as one (or more) completely generalized species l (s l = 0). <lb/>A second measure of the distribution of specificities within a network is its evenness, denoted E. We <lb/>define s ′ as all the unique values of s, rounded to the second decimal place. We define U as the ordered <lb/>set of s ′ values and u as each of the elements of this set. Thus p(u) is the probability associated to a <lb/>given element of U. For example, if s ′ = [0.1, 1, 1, 0, 0.4], then U = [0, 0.1, 0.4, 1], p(u = 1) = 2/5, and <lb/>p(u = 0) = 1/5. With this information, we calculate the self-information [38] of u as I(u) = −ln(u), and <lb/>based on these two sets of values, we calculate the Shannon&apos;s entropy of the distribution of specificity <lb/>values as <lb/>H = ∑ u∈U [p(u)I(u)] <lb/>If U takes on N possible values, then the theoretical maximum of H (attained when all values of s ′ are <lb/>unique, i.e. no two species are equally specialised) is <lb/>H max = ln(N) <lb/>To eliminate any scaling effect that might occur due to different network sizes, we take the exponentials <lb/>of these values [39], such that the standardized value of E is <lb/>E = e H−H max <lb/>It follows that E = 1 when no two organisms have the same level of specificity, and E = 0 when all values <lb/>of s ′ are equal. Note that rounding to the second decimal place allows accounting for the fact that some <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>organisms may have very similar (but not exactly equal) specificities. Small differences in the values <lb/>of specificity are less important than the potential amplitude of measurement error, as preliminary tests <lb/>indicated that the rounding of s ′ does not qualitatively change observed relationships. It is also known <lb/>that small differences in link strength have little or no impact in larger networks [40]. <lb/>Finally, we present a simple summary statistic that we call &quot;strategy diversity&quot; (D), <lb/>D = 1 <lb/>2 (E + R) <lb/>which given that both E and R take values in [0, 1], will also return values in this range. D = 1 indicates <lb/>that the specificity values found in a network range from highly specialized to highly generalized and <lb/>are evenly distributed. D = 0 means that a network is composed entirely of species sharing the same <lb/>specificity values. The two advantages of D are (i) it accounts both for the range of specificities and their <lb/>distribution, and (ii) it is independent of the observed specificity values. We expect strategy diversity (D) <lb/>to peak at intermediate values of connectance and specificity, to increase with nestedness, and to decrease <lb/>with modularity (Fig. 1). The reasoning is as follows. Interaction matrices are physically constrained <lb/>objects, in that adding interactions will modify their properties, and thus produce artifacts [28,41]. By <lb/>definition, a perfectly nested network maximizes strategy diversity [31], and a modular network tends <lb/>to minimize it. A matrix with minimal fill for a given size has all interactions on the diagonal, and <lb/>is therefore highly specialized, with no strategy diversity. Conversely, a completely filled network is <lb/>extremely generalized, and thus has no strategy diversity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>All types of network tend to have more strategy diversity and to be composed of more specialized species <lb/>than expected by chance (Table 1). For each empirical network, we measure whether its structural prop-<lb/>erties (strategy diversity, nestedness, modularity) are higher or lower than expected by chance using the <lb/>two null models. Our results are reported in Table 1. Both null models gave consistent results regarding <lb/>whether the empirical networks represented a deviation from random expectations. Host-parasite net-<lb/>works are on average less modular than expected, herbivory networks are more, and there is no clear <lb/>trend in pollination networks. There is a marked tendency towards higher than expected nestedness in all <lb/>types of interactions. <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Connectance <lb/>Diversity of strategies <lb/>More strategy diversty <lb/>No difference from chance expectation <lb/>Less strategy diversity <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Average specificity <lb/>Diversity of strategies <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Nestedness <lb/>Diversity of strategies <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>• <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>Modularity <lb/>Diversity of strategies <lb/>Figure 2: Values of average specificity, nestedness, connectance, and modularity for networks with more <lb/>(orange) or less (purple) strategy diversity than expected by chance.

			<body>that are either more or less functionally diverse than expected under the assumptions of null model II <lb/>(using the outcomes of model I yields the same qualitative results; see Table 1). Regardless of the baseline <lb/>differences between types of network for each of the metrics considered, higher diversity responded in a <lb/>consistent way to variation in the other metrics. Networks with higher average specificity tended to have <lb/>lower average strategy diversity, higher connectance, higher nestedness, and lower modularity (Table 2). <lb/>There are significant interactions between all of the variables and the network having higher strategy <lb/>diversity than expected by chance, with the exception of modularity (Table 3). These four metrics alone <lb/>account for 96% of the variance of strategy diversity, and 63% of the variance in the deviation of this <lb/>same metric. All metrics except modularity had a significant impact on strategy diversity. Interestingly, <lb/>connectance was the best predictor of strategy diversity, whereas nestedness was the best predictor of <lb/>the extent to which strategy diversity in the empirical networks deviates from random expectations. This <lb/>is because by definition, null model testing removes most of the effects of connectance. The type of <lb/>ecological interaction was not significant; detecting possible significance would have probably required <lb/>a larger sample size for non-parasitic networks. <lb/>We finally examine the relationships between network metrics and strategy diversity (Fig. 3). Strategy <lb/>diversity increases with connectance (it is expected to be 0 for a connectance of 1, but no network in our <lb/>dataset is densely connected), decreases with average specificity (as before, strategy diversity is 0 if mean <lb/>specificity is 0), increases linearly with nestedness, and decreases with modularity. An interesting result <lb/>in this analysis is that the trend is the same for all three types of interaction considered, with the exception <lb/>that herbivory and pollination networks tended to occupy the &quot;low connectance&quot; end of the gradient; they <lb/>behave in the same way as do parasitism networks, reinforcing the idea that structural constraints such as <lb/>that introduced by connectance may be driving emergent network properties [28,42]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the co-occurrence of potentially competing species, <lb/>including behavior [43], spatial or temporal heterogeneity [9], and trade-offs associated with species in-<lb/>teractions [1,12,44]. Ecological factors such as environmental and spatial heterogeneity and evolutionary <lb/>processes such as niche partitioning may permit the coexistence between competing species with similar <lb/>and/or different number of resources [45,46]. However, most of these results were obtained in systems of <lb/>low complexity, and the extent to which specialists and generalists co-occur in natural communities re-<lb/>mains to be evaluated. By analyzing three bipartite network datasets covering a range of both ecological <lb/>and structural situations, we show how co-occurrence can be linked with other topological network prop-<lb/>erties. This calls for a better integration of network methodology to the analysis of community structure, <lb/>with the aim of understanding the co-occurrence of species with different specificities. <lb/>Most emergent network properties could be predicted based on connectance alone [28]. This included, <lb/>notably, components of the degree distribution (how many interactions are established/received by each <lb/>species) involved in determining nestedness. The fact that the relationship between connectance, emer-<lb/>gent metrics (such as nestedness and modularity), and strategy diversity is conserved across types of <lb/>ecological interactions can be explained in part by these physical constraints. The fact that some inter-<lb/>actions appear more or less specialised reflects average differences in connectance in these communities. <lb/>Null models analysis nonetheless reveals that, for all types of interaction, approximately two-thirds of <lb/>all networks had more strategy diversity than expected by chance; this suggests that despite physical <lb/>constraints, ecological and/or evolutionary mechanisms are involved in promoting high diversity [8,47]. <lb/>Overall, we report that networks with higher nestedness and lower modularity, also had more strategy <lb/>diversity than expected under the assumptions of the two null models. If the main difference between <lb/>interaction types is their connectance, then the different mechanisms involved must be studied alongside <lb/>their impacts on network structure. Species specialization is regulated by differences in life-history traits <lb/>[1], competition for access to resources [45,48], or phylogenetic conservatism in attack/defense strategies <lb/>[49]. Through their impact on species range of resources used, these factors are likely to be involved in <lb/>driving network structure, and connectance in particular. For example, in herbivorous systems, plants <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>may employ multiple defenses against enemies, including the release of toxic compounds [50] and/or <lb/>attraction of a herbivore&apos;s natural enemies [51-54]. The simultaneous existence of different levels of <lb/>defense such as those mentioned above may promote lower connectance. It can also result in the faster <lb/>diversification of exploitation strategies at the upper level (in the sense that enemies specialize on a <lb/>defense mechanism rather than on the set of defended species) than in other types of interaction rely on <lb/>narrower sets of mechanisms [15]. This may result in the maintenance of high strategy diversity relative <lb/>to connectance in some antagonistic interactions. <lb/>In summary, although the ecological nature of an interaction (mutualistic or antagonistic) has an impact <lb/>on network structure, higher than expected strategy diversity appears to be a conserved property in bipar-<lb/>tite ecological networks. The particular position occupied by a network along a continuum of, e.g. con-<lb/>nectance or nestedness, can emerge because of the life-history traits of species establishing interactions, <lb/>and we suggest that increased attention should be given to understanding how fine-scale mechanisms at <lb/>the individual or population level drive the structure of community-level networks. It is nonetheless clear <lb/>that despite theoretical predictions, generalists and specialists are often found together in nature. Under-<lb/>standing this gap between predictions and observations will be a major challenge that should be addressed <lb/>by investigating the mechanisms of coexistence and co-occurrence in large multi-species communities. <lb/></body>
