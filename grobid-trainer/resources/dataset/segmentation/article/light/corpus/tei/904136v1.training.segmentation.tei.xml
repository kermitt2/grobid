			<front>Abstract <lb/>A major issue in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is &quot;de-<lb/>duplication&quot; or removal of repeated isolates, for which there exist multiple methods. <lb/>The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance <lb/>System (GLASS) requires de-duplication by selecting only the first isolate of a given <lb/>bacterial species per patient per surveillance period per specimen type per age group, <lb/>gender, and infection origin stratification. However, no study on the comparative <lb/>application of this method has been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate <lb/>differences in data tabulation between the WHO GLASS and the Japan Nosocomial <lb/>Infections Surveillance (JANIS) system, which counts both patients and isolates after <lb/>removing repeated isolates of the same bacterial species per multiresistance phenotype <lb/>isolated from a patient within 30 days, regardless of specimen type. All bacterial data, <lb/>consisting of approximately 8 million samples from 1795 Japanese hospitals in 2017 <lb/>were exported from the JANIS database, and were tabulated using either the de-<lb/>duplication algorithm of GLASS, or JANIS. We compared the tabulated results of the <lb/>total number of patients whose blood and urine cultures were taken and of the <lb/>percentage of resistant isolates of Escherichia coli for each priority antibiotic. The <lb/></front>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<front>number of patients per specimen type tabulated by the JANIS method was always <lb/>smaller than that of GLASS. There was a small (&lt; 3%) difference in the percentage of <lb/>resistance of E. coli for any antibiotic between the two methods in both out-and <lb/>inpatient settings and blood and urine isolates. The two tabulation methods did not show <lb/>considerable differences in terms of the tabulated percentages of resistance for E. coli. <lb/>We further discuss how the use of GLASS tabulations to create a public software and <lb/>website that could help to facilitate the understanding of and treatment against AMR. <lb/>(294/300 words) <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health threat and its surveillance is of <lb/>vital importance as underscored by the development of the Global Action Plan on AMR <lb/>launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 (1). AMR could result in <lb/>10 million deaths per year by 2050 (2, 3) and incur high economic costs (3, 4). The <lb/>WHO Global Action Plan 2015 emphasizes the need to develop surveillance plans to <lb/>track AMR across the globe. To enable this, proper information technology (IT) <lb/>infrastructure is essential at both the national and international level (5, 6). In an effort <lb/>to facilitate this, the WHO created the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance <lb/>System (GLASS) in October 2015 that aims to enable international comparison, <lb/>analysis, and sharing of AMR data by encouraging countries to submit their national <lb/>AMR surveillance data via the internet in a unified manner (7, 8). <lb/>One of the largest IT-based national AMR surveillance systems in the world is the <lb/>Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) program, which centralizes AMR <lb/>related hospital data and allows it to be compiled, analyzed, and published as not only <lb/>national AMR surveillance reports but also benchmarking feedback reports for each <lb/>participating hospital to facilitate infection control practices (6, 9). JANIS became <lb/>completely web-based in 2007, and the number of hospitals participating in the Clinical <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Laboratory module has steadily increased to 2120 hospitals (of the approximately 8,000 <lb/>hospitals across Japan) at the beginning of 2019. Notably, the Clinical Laboratory <lb/>module collects all routine bacteriological test results. JANIS started approximately 10 <lb/>years earlier than GLASS and has its own rules and methods for the tabulation of data. <lb/>National AMR data from Japan in 2017 were published in GLASS Early <lb/>implementation reports (8) based on data used to generate the annual open report for <lb/>JANIS (JANIS English website https://janis.mhlw.go.jp/english) using its original <lb/>tabulation method. To allow for international comparison, it is necessary to clarify the <lb/>differences between the tabulation methods used by various AMR surveillance <lb/>databases in an effort to reduce their impact on national AMR statistics. <lb/>A major difference between these systems lies in their &quot;de-duplication&quot; method that <lb/>removes repeated isolates of the same bacterial species from the same patient over time <lb/>so that duplicate findings are excluded before generating the aggregated data. There are <lb/>a number of approaches for &quot;de-duplication&quot;, and there is no single &quot;ideal&quot; approach; <lb/>however, some have been shown to have greater feasibility than others. These data can <lb/>be used for different purposes such as infection prevention and control purposes, and <lb/>generating an annual AMR surveillance report used for treatment guidelines or facility <lb/>benchmarking. In previous studies, Kohlmann et al (2016) reported the differences <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>between various de-duplication methods. Their report indicated differences in resistance <lb/>rates of up to five percent for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella <lb/>pneumoniae and up to ten percent for Pseudomonas aeruginosa between the three <lb/>different methods: 1) selecting all isolates (i.e., without de-duplication), 2) different <lb/>episode-based de-duplications (minimal time interval: 2, 5, 10, 30, or 100 days) and 3) <lb/>de-duplication selecting the first isolate for each patient (10). For P. aeruginosa, <lb/>Acinetobacter baumannii and other species commonly found in healthcare-associated <lb/>infections, there are frequently many repeated isolates in multiple specimen types over <lb/>an extended period time, which makes the impact of the different methods larger. The <lb/>European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study <lb/>Group for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ESGARS) also reported similar <lb/>results when they did their comparisons (11). <lb/>The Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) also mentions that de-<lb/>duplication is defined as &quot;the inclusion of only the first isolate of a given species per <lb/>patient per analysis period,&quot; for any full dataset of data subject, i.e. the third de-<lb/>duplication method mentioned above (10). WHO GLASS chose the &quot;first isolate&quot; or <lb/>&quot;one isolate per patient&quot; approach to create the internationally standardized reporting <lb/>structure , consistent with CLSI recommendations, for several reasons, including <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>feasibility (not all the countries can apply even this simple algorithm) and the fact that <lb/>many countries already have been use this approach when reporting to international <lb/>networks, including the countries enrolled in the European Antimicrobial Resistance <lb/>Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) (12) and the Central Asian and Eastern European <lb/>Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (CAESAR) network (13). <lb/>Consistent with the networks mentioned above, WHO GLASS recommends the <lb/>simple &quot;one isolate per patient&quot; tabulation stratified by specimen type, and further data <lb/>stratification for gender, age group, and &quot;infection origin&quot; (isolates collected on hospital <lb/>day 3 or later are considered &quot;hospital origin&quot; while other hospital isolates and all <lb/>outpatient isolates are considered &quot;community origin&quot;): &quot;For each surveillance period <lb/>(e.g. 12 months), only one result should be reported for each patient per surveyed <lb/>specimen type and surveyed pathogen&quot; (Guide to preparing aggregated antimicrobial <lb/>resistance data files in GLASS) (7). Similarly, GLASS requests each country to report <lb/>the number of patients tested including both positive and negative (no growth) samples <lb/>classified according to gender, age group and infection origin (community or hospital) <lb/>after de-duplication and specimen (BLOOD, URINE, STOOL, and GENITAL swab) <lb/>stratification.. However, no study has reported a comparison between the de-duplication <lb/>method from the WHO GLASS system and any other method. Here, we conducted a <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>comparison using the national AMR data from Japan (2017) stored in the JANIS <lb/>database. As mentioned above, the data submitted to GLASS were tabulated using a <lb/>method that has been used in JANIS because the JANIS team had not yet developed a <lb/>tabulation program implementing stratified de-duplication. Basically, JANIS uses a <lb/>method that removes repeated isolates of the same species isolated from a patient within <lb/>30 days, regardless of specimen type but considering the antimicrobial resistance <lb/>phenotype. Therefore, the de-duplication method from JANIS is conceptually different <lb/>from that of GLASS. <lb/>Our systematic and quantitative comparison revealed the extent of these differences <lb/>and illustrated how these differences could influence the surveillance statistics including <lb/>the total number of patients and percentage of resistance for each bacterial species with <lb/>respect to different classes of antimicrobial drugs. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Data preparation, tabulation, and analysis <lb/>Data from approximately 8 million samples collected during 2017 were exported from <lb/>the JANIS database as a text file. This file was sorted according to facility ID, patient <lb/>ID, specimen collection date, inpatient or outpatient, and specimen ID. <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>The file was tabulated using the de-duplication algorithm from either JANIS or <lb/>WHO GLASS (see below for detail) using an in-house Java program to create two files <lb/>required for WHO-GLASS submission (7): 1) Sample file containing the number of <lb/>patients from whom GLASS priority specimens were taken, stratified by specimen type, <lb/>gender, infection origin (inpatient or outpatient), and age group; 2) RIS file with <lb/>susceptibility testing results containing the number of resistant, intermediate and <lb/>susceptible isolates (and other interpretations of antimicrobial susceptibility testing <lb/>(AST) results), stratified by the same variables as in the Sample file. Among the &quot;other <lb/>interpretations of AST results&quot;, GLASS requires a calculation of the number of isolates <lb/>with AST results not reported or not performed for each antibiotic (indicated as <lb/>UNKNOWN_NO_AST variable in GLASS) in order to estimate the magnitude of <lb/>selective testing. The in-house Java program also implemented a function to calculate <lb/>this value. Because age and gender are input fields in WHO-GLASS but not in JANIS, a <lb/>subset of the data that did not have age or gender information was excluded from the <lb/>tabulation. <lb/>The two types of tabulated files were further processed to calculate summations <lb/>across genders and according to new age groups (~14, 15-64, 65~) rather than those <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>defined by GLASS (&lt;1, 1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, <lb/>85+) using an in-house Perl script. <lb/>In the graphs and tables, names of the antibiotics have been abbreviated using the <lb/>WHO-GLASS guidelines and appear as follows: ampicillin = AMP, imipenem = IPM, <lb/>meropenem = MEM, cefotaxime = CTX, ceftriaxone = CRO, ceftazidime = CAZ, <lb/>cefepime = FEP, levofloxacin = LVX, ciprofloxacin = CIP. <lb/>Comparison of de-duplications between WHO-GLASS and JANIS <lb/>Both the Sample and RIS files were generated from the same database for the specific <lb/>purpose of reporting to GLASS. De-duplication is performed on the source database as <lb/>follows. For the counting of the number of patients in the Sample file, GLASS requires <lb/>selection and reporting of only the first result from bacterial culture during each <lb/>surveillance period (e.g. 12 months) for each patient in each specimen type and data <lb/>stratification (7). On the other hand, JANIS&apos; server-side program selects the first result <lb/>from each patient during a 30 day cycle with each resistance phenotype irrespective of <lb/>specimen type, given that a subsequent bacterial culturing after 30 days usually <lb/>corresponds to a different episode given the average length of a hospital stay (&lt; 30 <lb/>days) in Japan. Thus, JANIS targets infected/non-infected patients, independent from <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>the anatomical site of infection. <lb/>To count the number of resistant, intermediate and susceptible isolates (and other <lb/>interpretations of AST results) for each bacterial species, as in the RIS file, GLASS <lb/>requires the same de-duplication as before: selection and reporting of only the first <lb/>result of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for each surveillance period for each patient <lb/>per specimen type and data stratification and bacterial species (7). To count the isolates <lb/>used in antibiograms constructed for each surveyed species in the national and feedback <lb/>reports from JANIS, its server-side program also conducts the same de-duplication <lb/>using the 30 day rule, but selects and counts isolates with significantly different drug <lb/>susceptibility as different isolates even if they were isolated within 30 days from the <lb/>same patient (9, 14). A subsequent isolate is selected and counted if it shows change <lb/>from susceptible to resistant (or vice versa) or a 4-fold or more comparison of MIC <lb/>value for a specific antibiotic when compared to a previous isolate from the same <lb/>patient within the 30-day period. <lb/>These differences are summarized in Table 1. <lb/>Table 1. Differences in the de-duplication methods from GLASS and JANIS. <lb/></body>

			<body>following approval by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (approval number <lb/>1115-3) according to Article 32 of the Statistics Act. <lb/>Results <lb/>National phenotypic AMR surveillance data collected at 1795 Japanese hospitals in <lb/>2017 were tabulated according to the procedure defined by WHO-GLASS or JANIS, <lb/>respectively. The number of tabulated patients whose blood and urine cultures were <lb/>taken is shown stratified by inpatient, outpatient, and age group in Fig 1A and 1B, <lb/>respectively. In the former, both the total number of outpatients and inpatients de-<lb/>duplicated by the GLASS method (red bars in the &quot;Total&quot; in Fig 1A) were <lb/>approximately 140,000 and 200,000 more than those included using the JANIS method <lb/>(blue bars in &quot;Total&quot; in Fig 1A). GLASS counts the number of patients infected per <lb/>anatomical site (i.e. the number of cases of different types of infection). The <lb/>discrepancy between JANIS and GLASS probably results from the fact that JANIS only <lb/>considers the site of the first occurrence of the pathogen, but ignores the others <lb/>(presuming that the following isolates have approximately the same resistance <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>characteristics, so we can ignore them). Similarly, in the latter, the total number of <lb/>outpatients and inpatients de-duplicated using the GLASS method (red bars in &quot;Total&quot; <lb/>in Fig 1B right) were approximately 140,000 and 280,000 more than those included <lb/>when the data were interpreted using the JANIS method (blue bars in &quot;Total&quot; in Fig 1B <lb/>right). For both blood and urine, the difference was at least 140,000 larger in the <lb/>inpatients than in outpatients. When the difference was examined between the three age <lb/>groups (~14, 15-64, 65~), it was largest in the 65 years old group irrespective of <lb/> <lb/>outpatient, inpatient, and specimen type: the number of patients de-duplicated using the <lb/>GLASS method was approximately 90,000-200,000 more than that of JANIS (blue vs <lb/>red bars in &quot;65~&quot; in Fig 1A and 1B). An explanation for this may be that older patients <lb/>tend to have multiple specimen types involved in an infection. <lb/>Fig 1. Comparison of the number of patients with samples (blood and urine) <lb/>collected for bacteriological testing. The value was determined from the tabulated <lb/>numbers for NUMSAMPLEDPATIENTS in the Sample file required for submission to <lb/>GLASS and is shown separately for outpatient (left) and inpatient (right). The x-axis <lb/>denotes age group and &quot;Total&quot; indicates the sum of all three age groups. The blue and <lb/></body>

			<body>dark red bars are the outcomes from JANIS and GLASS, respectively. (A) Blood. (B) <lb/>Urine. <lb/>The number of patients per specimen type tabulated by the JANIS method was <lb/>always smaller than those created using the GLASS method as the former conducts de-<lb/>duplication of isolates of the same species isolated from a patient within 30 days, <lb/>regardless of specimen type: when an isolate is found in urine and another was found in <lb/>the blood (or vice versa) within 30 days, JANIS selects only the 1 st isolate and ignores <lb/>the subsequent isolate, which results in decreased numbers of patients per specimen <lb/>type. <lb/>Next, comparison of the percentages of resistant isolates (using the total number of <lb/>isolates with AST results for each antibiotic separately as the denominator) stratified by <lb/>outpatient, inpatient, and specimen type in E. coli tabulated using the GLASS or JANIS <lb/>methods are shown in Fig 2. JANIS method can use either just the 30 day rule to count <lb/>patients (&quot;JANIS (patients)&quot; in blue in Fig 2), or it can account for the AST results and <lb/>count isolates by selecting those with significantly different drug susceptibilities <lb/>(&quot;JANIS (isolates)&quot; in light blue in Fig 2, see Materials and Methods for the detail). In <lb/>respect of the E. coli blood isolates, there was little difference in resistance to any of the <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>surveyed antibiotic when using the GLASS method between either the outpatient or <lb/>inpatient settings (Fig 2A and 2B). The largest difference among the three groups was <lb/>seen in the resistance to levofloxacin (LVX), with almost 1.8% resistance in outpatients <lb/>and 1.6% in inpatients. For the E. coli urine isolates, the largest difference in resistance <lb/>was similarly seen in levofloxacin (LVX), with almost 2.7% in outpatients and 2.8% in <lb/>inpatients (Fig 2C and 2D). Comparison between the method for counting patients and <lb/>that for counting isolates from JANIS showed that the former (&quot;JANIS (patients)&quot; <lb/>colored in blue in Fig 2) kept the resistance values more similar to the GLASS <lb/>outcomes than the latter (&quot;JANIS (isolates)&quot; colored in light blue in Fig 2). This is <lb/>because the latter conducts an additional selection and counting step to isolate samples <lb/>with significantly different drug susceptibility, but both the JANIS method for counting <lb/>the patient and that of GLASS do not. The difference is, however, small and at most <lb/>2.8%. Even if we stratified the data using the three age groups as in Fig 1, we found the <lb/>same result and the difference was at most 3.2%. <lb/>Fig 2. Comparison of percentages of resistant E. coli. Each value was calculated as <lb/>the number of resistant isolates divided by the total number of isolates tested for an <lb/>antimicrobial drug in the RIS file required for submission to GLASS, and is shown <lb/></body>

			<body>separately for outpatient (left) and inpatient (right). The blue and light blue bars indicate <lb/>the number of patients and isolates tabulated using the de-duplication method from <lb/>JANIS (see Materials and Methods for detail). The dark red bars indicate the number of <lb/>patients (that have 1-to-1 correspondence to the isolates) using the de-duplication <lb/>method from GLASS. (A-B) Blood. The denominator for each antibiotic is always &gt; 80,000 <lb/>in outpatient and &gt; 60,000 in inpatient settings, respectively. (C-D) Urine. The denominator for <lb/>each antibiotic is always &gt;10,000 in both outpatient and inpatient settings. <lb/>In a voluntary surveillance like JANIS, the total number is not equal between <lb/>participating hospitals because of the variability in manners and procedures for routine <lb/>AST between institutions. In this situation, GLASS requires a calculation of the number <lb/>of isolates without AST results (indicated as UNKNOWN_NO_AST variable, see <lb/>also Materials and Methods). The percentages shown in Fig 2 were calculated without <lb/>including this parameter, but we examined to what extent resistance changed following <lb/>its inclusion (yellow in Fig 3 compared to red). The inclusion of these data increases the <lb/>denominator and of course decreases the rate of resistance, but the extent was almost <lb/>always less than 5%. In the case of ciprofloxacin (CIP), however, the inclusion of these <lb/>data decreased the resistance rates for blood isolates up to 13.6% to 16.4% and 17.4% to <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>20.6% in urine isolates in outpatient and inpatient settings, respectively. This is because <lb/>many AST results were not reported or not performed for CIP, which accounts for &gt; <lb/>30% of the total denominator. To account for these points, the GLASS report shows <lb/>percentages of resistance without including UNKNOWN_NO_AST in the denominator <lb/>(as in Fig 2 from this study) but marks an antibiotic like CIP as &quot;&gt; 30% unknown AST <lb/>results&quot; using a different color. <lb/>Fig 3. Comparison of the percentage of resistant E. coli in various samples <lb/>including or excluding UNKNOWN-NO-AST. The number was calculated as the <lb/>value for RESISTANT divided by the total number of isolates tested with or without <lb/>&quot;UNKNOWN-NO-AST&quot; representing the number of isolates with AST results not <lb/>performed or reported (colored in yellow or red) for an antimicrobial drug in the RIS <lb/>file required for submission to GLASS, and is shown separately for outpatient (left) and <lb/>inpatients (right). (A-B) Blood. (C-D) Urine. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Patients with infectious diseases are usually subject to multiple rounds of specimen <lb/>sampling for diagnostic or prognostic evaluations, particularly in the case of <lb/>antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Inclusion of all samples would lead to an <lb/>overestimation of the proportion of resistance in a given population. De-duplication <lb/>methods aim to reduce such bias. Our comparison of the de-duplication methods used <lb/>for national surveillance between WHO GLASS and JANIS revealed little differences <lb/>in the tabulated percentages of resistance to any antibiotic surveyed by GLASS, <lb/>although WHO GLASS takes the difference in specimen type into account but JANIS <lb/>does not. <lb/>Meanwhile, the comparison showed considerable differences in the number of <lb/>tabulated patients per specimen type. The difference in the total number of patients per <lb/>specimen type tabulated by the two methods was larger in the inpatient samples <lb/>probably because inpatients are usually subject to broader sampling than outpatients are. <lb/>The de-duplication method from JANIS selects the first result every 30 days for each <lb/>patient irrespective of specimen type, while GLASS selects the first result for each <lb/>specimen type. When the difference was examined between three age groups (~14, 15-<lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>64, 65~), the difference was largest in the 65 years old group probably because it is <lb/> <lb/>more common to collect different specimens from patients over 65 years old. <lb/>The tabulated number of patients per specimen type is used in the GLASS report as <lb/>a denominator for calculating frequency of infection of specific AMR bacteria in the <lb/>&quot;Non-susceptible pathogen-antimicrobial combination frequency&quot; and &quot;Non-susceptible <lb/>pathogen-meropenem combination stratified frequency&quot; sections (8). The de-duplication <lb/>method used by JANIS makes the number of patients for the specimen type lower, <lb/>corresponding to higher frequencies of infection (per 100,000 tested patients) if the <lb/>numerator is the same. However, the de-duplication method used by JANIS will also <lb/>make the numerator lower, because the pathogen for that specimen type will be <lb/>excluded if it isn&apos;t the first pathogen. Therefore, the frequency of specimen-type <lb/>specific infection rate might or might not become higher. <lb/>National AMR data from Japan in 2017 were first included in the GLASS report <lb/>(early implementation 2017-2018). These data were based on the dataset used for the <lb/>annual open report from JANIS in 2017 and the tabulation method used was the one <lb/>from JANIS. This study confirmed that there was no problem in terms of tabulated <lb/>percentage of resistance, although it showed considerable differences in the number of <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>tabulated patients per specimen type. Based on these results, Japan will prepare and <lb/>submit data in 2018 after using the de-duplication method defined by GLASS. <lb/>The outpatients and inpatients in this study were tabulated from data related to <lb/>strains isolated from patients before or after hospitalization, and do not always <lb/>correspond to community-acquired or hospital-acquired infection, which may be more <lb/>important in a clinical setting, but are very difficult to classify. For example, in the <lb/>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hospital acquired and Ventilator associated Pneumonia <lb/>by Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society, hospital <lb/>acquired pneumonia is defined as that development of infection 48 h after admission <lb/>(15). However, the admission date is not a mandatory field in JANIS, making it <lb/>impossible to automatically classify community-acquired and hospital-acquired <lb/>infections. <lb/>In a previous study, Kohlmann et al. compared the percentages of resistance tabulated <lb/>from the first isolate, isolates selected after de-duplication assuming an episode of 100/ <lb/>30/ 10/ 5 or 2 days and all isolates (10). Their study reported that there was small (at <lb/>most a few percentage) difference in tabulated percentages of resistance between the <lb/>first isolate rule and those calculated assuming a 30 day episode(10). In another study <lb/>(16), Hindler et al. reported the same kind of findings: 1) de-duplication is important, <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>otherwise resistance rates become significantly higher; 2) the manner in which repeated <lb/>isolates are removed is less important -they will lead to different estimates (predictably <lb/>higher or lower depending on the method), but the differences are relatively small. They <lb/>are consistent with our results that found almost no difference between the de-<lb/>duplication methods from GLASS and JANIS. <lb/>Regarding the de-duplication method from JANIS, it is either just the 30 day rule <lb/>used to count the patients or you can add the AST results to count isolates by selecting <lb/>those with significantly different drug susceptibility. When the latter is used as a <lb/>numerator, the percentage of resistance increases slightly. This is because of the count <lb/>of subsequent isolates that show change from susceptible to resistant (or vice versa) or <lb/>4-fold or more comparison of MIC values for an antibiotic compared to the previous <lb/>isolate from the same patient even within a 30 day period However, in the data from <lb/>Japan in 2017 used in the WHO GLASS report, the count did not include this AST <lb/>analysis and thus the percentage of resistance was closer to the value calculated using <lb/>the first-isolate rule from GLASS. <lb/>For data submission to WHO GLASS, each country must prepare the RIS file <lb/>containing 15 variables (COUNTRY, YEAR, SPECIMEN, PATHOGEN, GENDER, <lb/>ORIGIN, AGE GROUP, ANTIBIOTIC, RESISTANT, INTERMEDIATE, NON-<lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>SUSCEPTIBLE, SUSCEPTIBLE, UNKNOWN_NO_AST, <lb/>UNKNOWN_NO_BREAKPOINTS, BATCH ID) and a Sample file containing 8 <lb/>variables (COUNTRY, YEAR, SPECIMEN, GENDER, ORIGIN, AGE GROUP, <lb/>NUMSAMPLEDPATIENTS, BATCH ID) (7). WHO GLASS requests that submitters <lb/>calculate the number of isolates with AST results not reported or not performed for a <lb/>specific antibiotic (indicated as UNKNOWN_NO_AST), which is needed to estimate <lb/>the magnitude of the bias related to selective testing. However, it is not included in the <lb/>denominator used to calculate the percentage of resistance in the GLASS report. For <lb/>example, in our study, the proportion of UNKNOWN_NO_AST was highest <lb/>(approximately 50%) in ciprofloxacin among both blood and urine isolates. In the <lb/>GLASS report, ciprofloxacin is indeed marked as &quot;&gt; 30% unknown AST results&quot;, but <lb/>its percentage of resistance is almost the same as that of levofloxacin, after excluding <lb/>the number of UNKNOWN_NO_AST isolates from the denominator. This suggests that <lb/>the number of UNKNOWN_NO_AST should not greatly impact resistance estimates if <lb/>there is no bias in which strains were or were not tested. On the other hand, if certain <lb/>reserve agents are only tested as second-line agents, then this could introduce significant <lb/>bias towards higher resistance estimates.. <lb/></body>

			<body>As a publicly available product of the present study, we have created an Excel tool <lb/>that stores and can analyze the data tabulated using the GLASS de-duplication method. <lb/>This is now downloadable from the home page of the antimicrobial resistance research <lb/>center at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases <lb/>(https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/from-lab/2415-amrc/9213-janis-glass-excel-en.html). <lb/>Users can interact with these data by simply clicking their mouse. This tool (its <lb/>graphical user interface is shown in S1 Figure) can create antibiograms stratified by the <lb/>bed size of hospitals (under 200, over 200 and under 500, over 500 beds), inpatient or <lb/>outpatient, gender, specimen type, and age group as defined by GLASS. Based on this, <lb/>users can create antibiograms after excluding UNKNOWN_NO_AST. As another <lb/>variable regarding missing data, GLASS defines UNKNOWN_NO_BREAKPOINTS <lb/>representing the number of isolates where AST was performed but no interpretation of <lb/>the results is available for a specific antibiotic. In the Excel tool, we have renamed this <lb/>as UNKNOWN_NO_SIR to imply that S-I-R interpretation was not possible. It can be <lb/>included or excluded from the denominator for calculating resistance rates in the tool. <lb/>Furthermore, we have tabulated the data from 2011 to 2017 for each prefecture using <lb/>the de-duplication method from GLASS. The data were incorporated into the One <lb/>health platform website (https://amr-onehealth-platform.ncgm.go.jp) created by the <lb/></body>

			<body>Antimicrobial Resistant Clinical Reference Center, National Center of Global Medicine, <lb/>in which each antibiotic can be individually evaluated for an annual trend regarding <lb/>percentage of resistance, and its distribution among the prefectures and reported as a <lb/>map. <lb/>In conclusion, our comparison of the de-duplication methods used in national AMR <lb/>surveillance between the WHO GLASS and JANIS algorithms revealed a slight <lb/>difference in the tabulated percentages of resistance, but considerable differences in the <lb/>number of patients stratified by specimen type. Given these results, Japan will switch <lb/>to the de-duplication method from GLASS stratified by each specimen type for the next <lb/>submission of data in 2018 to GLASS, meanwhile annual reports of JANIS will <lb/>continue to tabulate all specimen type together. This study significantly deepened our <lb/>understanding of data tabulation in GLASS, which helped us to develop the publicly <lb/>available Excel tool that can be used to generate stratified antibiograms and the website <lb/>that may be broadly useful in understanding and combating AMR. <lb/></body>
