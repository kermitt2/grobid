			<front>Abstract: Nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are a class of drugs widely <lb/>prescribed to treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. Although previous <lb/>studies have established that N-BPs function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in <lb/>osteoclasts, the mechanism by which N-BPs enter the cytosol from the extracellular <lb/>space to reach their molecular target is not understood. Here we implemented a <lb/>CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified SLC37A3 (solute carrier family <lb/>37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs. We observed that SLC37A3 <lb/>forms a complex with ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor), a <lb/>previously identified genetic target of N-BPs. SLC37A3 and ATRAID localize to <lb/>lysosomes and are required for releasing N-BP molecules that have trafficked to <lb/>lysosomes through fluid-phase endocytosis into the cytosol. Our results elucidate the <lb/>route by which N-BPs are delivered to their molecular target, addressing a key aspect of <lb/>the mechanism of action of N-BPs that may have significant clinical relevance. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction: N-BPs are the most commonly prescribed drugs used to treat <lb/>osteoporosis (Drake et al., 2008). They have two negatively charged phosphonate <lb/>groups that bind to hydroxyapatite crystals with high affinity and enable efficient <lb/>accumulation of N-BPs on the bone surface (Drake et al., 2008). Osteoclasts, the major <lb/>cell type responsible for bone resorption, release N-BPs from the bone matrix by <lb/>dissolving bone mineral and then take up N-BPs through fluid-phase endocytosis <lb/>(Drake et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2006). N-BPs subsequently inhibit farnesyl <lb/>diphosphate synthase (FDPS) in the mevalonate pathway and reduce protein <lb/>prenylation, an essential post-translational lipid modification required for the function of <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>numerous proteins such as Ras, Rab and Rho, thereby inducing apoptosis in <lb/>osteoclasts and diminishing their bone-resorption activities (Drake et al., 2008; Dunford <lb/>et al., 2001; Fisher et al., 2000; Hughes et al., 1995; Kavanagh et al., 2006; Luckman et <lb/>al., 1998a; Luckman et al., 1998b; van Beek et al., 1999). However, it is not known how <lb/>highly charged N-BPs exit the endocytic pathway to target FDPS, which is localized to <lb/>the cytosol and peroxisomes (Martin et al., 2007). It has been proposed that the <lb/>acidification of endocytic compartments might neutralize the negative charges on the <lb/>phosphonate groups and allow N-BPs to diffuse across the vesicle membrane <lb/>(Thompson et al., 2006), but this model does not address the issue that the amine <lb/>groups in N-BPs become positively charged in acidic environments. An alternative <lb/>model is that a transporter exists that facilitates the exit of N-BPs from endocytic <lb/>vesicles. <lb/>Results and Discussion: To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of N-<lb/>BPs, including the mechanism by which N-BPs are delivered to their molecular target, <lb/>we implemented an unbiased genome-wide screening approach based on CRISPR-<lb/>mediated interference (CRISPRi) (Figure 1A) (Gilbert et al., 2014). We transduced a <lb/>genome-scale CRISPRi single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library into K562 human myeloid <lb/>leukemia cells that stably express a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein, which functions as an <lb/>sgRNA-guided transcription inhibitor. The cells were split into a population treated with <lb/>alendronate (ALN), a representative N-BP, and an untreated control population. <lb/>Through deep sequencing, we quantified the enrichment/depletion of each sgRNA in <lb/>the treated population compared to the control population (Figure 1B, Figure 1 -figure <lb/>supplement 1A), and designated the target genes of those sgRNAs enriched in the <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>treated population as resistance hits and those depleted as sensitizing hits (Figure 1B, <lb/>Figure 1 -figure supplement 1B and Supplementary Data Table 1). Consistent with the <lb/>current model for the action of N-BPs, enzymes, co-factors, and regulators of the <lb/>mevalonate pathway are enriched in top hits (Figure 1C-D and Figure 1 -figure <lb/>supplement 1C-D). Particularly, in accordance with the model that N-BPs induce cell <lb/>death through the reduction in protein prenylation, inhibition of FDPS and GGPPS1, the <lb/>enzymes that produce the substrates required for protein prenylation, strongly <lb/>sensitized cells to ALN (Figure 1C-D). <lb/>Amongst the resistance hits not known to be involved in the mevalonate <lb/>pathway, the gene that conferred the strongest resistance was SLC37A3 (Figure 1C), <lb/>which is predicted to encode a membrane protein with 12 transmembrane segments <lb/>(Chou et al., 2013). SLC37A3 also appeared as a top resistance hit in a second <lb/>CRISPRi screen using zoledronate, another representative N-BP, as the selection agent <lb/>(Figure 1 -figure supplement 1E and Supplementary Data Table 2), further supporting <lb/>its role in the mechanism of action of N-BPs. Little is known about the function of <lb/>SLC37A3, but it is predicted based on sequence homology to be a sugar-phosphate <lb/>antiporter (Chou et al., 2013). Intriguingly, a recent human protein interactome study <lb/>reported an interaction between SLC37A3 and ATRAID (Huttlin et al., 2017), a type I <lb/>transmembrane protein that was identified as an N-BP target in a previous work (L. E. <lb/>Surface et al.) and our zoledronate CRISPRi screen (Figure 1 -figure supplement 1E), <lb/>suggesting SLC37A3 and ATRAID might be functionally related. <lb/>To investigate the roles of SLC37A3 and ATRAID in the action of N-BPs, we <lb/>generated SLC37A3-knockout (SLC37A3 KO ) and ATRAID-knockout (ATRAID KO ) cells in <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>K562 cells, human embryo kidney (HEK) 293T cells and murine macrophage-like RAW <lb/>264.7 cells (Figure 2 -figure supplement 1A-E) (L. E. Surface et al.; Ran et al., 2013), <lb/>with K562 and HEK 293T cells serving as human cell models that represent distinct <lb/>lineages, and RAW 264.7 macrophages as a mouse cell model that can be <lb/>differentiated into mature osteoclasts (Collin-Osdoby and Osdoby, 2012). Consistent <lb/>with the CRISPRi screen and our previous results, knockout of SLC37A3 and ATRAID <lb/>in all cell types conferred resistance to ALN (Figure 2A-C) (L. E. Surface et al.). <lb/>Similarly, mature osteoclasts differentiated from knockout RAW cells are more resistant <lb/>to ALN compared to those differentiated from wild-type cells (Figure 2D and Figure 2 -<lb/>figure supplement 2A) (L. E. Surface et al.). We also measured the reduction in protein <lb/>prenylation as a readout of N-BP toxicity and verified that ALN treatment had <lb/>significantly less of an effect on protein prenylation in SLC37A3 KO and ATRAID KO cells <lb/>compared to wild-type cells (Figure 2E). Complementation with epitope-tagged <lb/>SLC37A3 or either isoform of ATRAID (a short isoform, UniProt Q6UW56-1, and a long <lb/>isoform, UniProt Q6UW56-3) in SLC37A3 KO or ATRAID KO HEK 293T cells, respectively, <lb/>restored sensitivity to ALN (Figure 2 -figure supplement 2B-D), confirming that the <lb/>resistance to ALN observed in the knockout cells is indeed caused by the lack of <lb/>SLC37A3 or ATRAID expression, and that the epitope-tagged versions of the two <lb/>proteins are functional. <lb/>The knockout cells are also resistant to N-BPs other than ALN (Figure 2 -figure <lb/>supplement 2E) but not to non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (non-N-BPs), <lb/>which do not target FDPS (Figure 2 -figure supplement 2F) (Drake et al., 2008). <lb/>Interestingly, knockout of SLC37A3 and ATRAID did not protect cells from lovastatin <lb/></body>

			<body>(LOV), a statin drug that also targets the mevalonate pathway (Figure 2 -figure <lb/>supplement 2G-I) (Tiwari and Khokhar, 2014). The distinctive responses of SLC37A3 KO <lb/>and ATRAID KO cells to N-BPs, non-N-BPs, and LOV indicate that the roles of SLC37A3 <lb/>and ATRAID in the mechanism of action of N-BPs are not related to the mevalonate <lb/>pathway but are instead specific to N-BPs. As knockout of SLC37A3 and ATRAID in <lb/>different cell types conferred similar responses, we focused on HEK 293T cells for <lb/>further studies as they host various tools for molecular biology. <lb/>To probe the epistatic relationship between the two genes, we generated double <lb/>knockout (ATRAID KO ; SLC37A3 KO , abbreviated as KO 2 ) cells (Figure 2 -figure <lb/>supplement 1F). We observed that SLC37A3 KO cells are more resistant to ALN <lb/>compared to ATRAID KO cells, and the knockout of ATRAID in addition to SLC37A3 did <lb/>not further protect cells from the drug (Figure 2F and Figure 2 -figure supplement 2J), <lb/>indicating that ATRAID and SLC37A3 are indeed functionally related and that SLC37A3 <lb/>is epistatic to ATRAID. <lb/>Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying the observed functional <lb/>relationship between ATRAID and SLC37A3. As protein localization can often provide <lb/>clues to protein function and functionally linked proteins frequently share subcellular <lb/>distribution patterns, we expressed functional, epitope-tagged SLC37A3 and ATRAID <lb/>from near-endogenous levels of transcripts (Figure 2 -figure supplement 2B-C and <lb/>Figure 3 -figure supplement 1A) and characterized their localization with <lb/>immunofluorescence (IF). We observed that SLC37A3 co-localizes with LAMP2, a <lb/>lysosomal marker, but not with Na + /K + -ATPase or EEA1, which mark the plasma <lb/>membrane and early endosomes, respectively (Figure 3A, B and Figure 3 -figure <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>supplement 1C). Both isoforms of ATRAID also predominantly localize to lysosomes but <lb/>not to the plasma membrane or early endosomes (Figure 3C-D and Figure 3 -figure <lb/>supplement 1D, F-H). When we co-expressed functionally-tagged SLC37A3 and <lb/>ATRAID (Figure 3 -figure supplement 1A-B), we observed that both isoforms of <lb/>ATRAID predominantly co-localize with SLC37A3 (Figure 3E and Figure 3 -figure <lb/>supplement 1E). To investigate whether the observed co-localization between SLC37A3 <lb/>and ATRAID represents a physical interaction, we performed reciprocal co-<lb/>immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in HEK 293T cells over-expressing the two <lb/>proteins. We detected an interaction between SLC37A3 and ATRAID in both pull-down <lb/>directions (Figure 3F), confirming that SLC37A3 and ATRAID physically interact, likely <lb/>forming a lysosomal complex. <lb/>As it has been reported that the expression levels of certain solute carriers <lb/>depend on the presence of accessory proteins (Makrides et al., 2014), we investigated <lb/>the possibility that the functional relationship between ATRAID and SLC37A3 is due to <lb/>the impaired expression of SLC37A3 in the absence of ATRAID. Indeed, when we <lb/>expressed SLC37A3 in the KO 2 cells, we observed a substantial decrease in the protein <lb/>level of SLC37A3 compared to that when expressed in the SLC37A3 KO background <lb/>(Figure 3G and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2A), even though the mRNA levels of <lb/>SLC37A3 in both backgrounds are similar (Figure 3 -figure supplement 1A). The <lb/>protein level of SLC37A3 was restored by complementation with either isoform of <lb/>ATRAID (Figure 3G). In reciprocity, we also observed reduced protein levels of both <lb/>isoforms of ATRAID in the KO 2 background that cannot be explained by changes in <lb/>transcript levels (Figure 3H, Figure 3 -figure supplement 2B-C and Figure 3 -figure <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>supplement 1A). As the translation efficiency of SLC37A3 transcripts is not significantly <lb/>altered in the absence of ATRAID (Figure 3 -figure supplement 2D-E), the decreased <lb/>SLC37A3 protein level in the KO 2 background is likely caused by shortened protein half-<lb/>life, suggesting that ATRAID and SLC37A3 are mutually dependent for their stability. <lb/>Intriguingly, the deletion of ATRAID also altered the glycosylation pattern of SLC37A3. <lb/>In the absence of ATRAID, the mature, glycosylated population of SLC37A3 (around <lb/>50kD) became undetectable, whereas a population of un-glycosylated SLC37A3 <lb/>(around 40kD) emerged (Figure 3G and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2F). Moreover, in <lb/>cells overexpressing SLC37A3, although a significant proportion of SLC37A3 remained <lb/>un-glycosylated, only the glycosylated population of SLC37A3 interacted with ATRAID <lb/>(Figure 3 -figure supplement 2G), suggesting that the interaction with ATRAID is crucial <lb/>for the expression of correctly modified SLC37A3. <lb/>Finally, we explored the mechanism by which the knockout of SLC37A3 and <lb/>ATRAID conferred resistance to N-BPs. Given the predicted function of SLC37A3 as a <lb/>transporter, we hypothesized that ATRAID and SLC37A3 transport N-BP molecules <lb/>across the lipid bilayer to inhibit FDPS. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding <lb/>that the role of SLC37A3 and ATRAID in the mechanism of action of N-BPs is specific <lb/>to the chemical properties of N-BPs. To test this hypothesis, we incubated wild-type, <lb/>ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO cells with radioactive ALN ( 3 H-ALN) and measured total <lb/>intracellular radioactivity. However, we observed no significant difference in <lb/>accumulation of radioactivity between the knockouts and wild-type cells (Figure 4A). As <lb/>a previous study showed that N-BP molecules traffic to acidified endocytic <lb/>compartments through fluid-phase endocytosis (Thompson et al., 2006), we further <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>hypothesized that N-BP molecules traffic to lysosomes and that SLC37A3 and ATRAID, <lb/>together as a lysosomal complex, might function to release N-BP molecules from the <lb/>lumen of lysosomes into the cytosol. This model predicts that the total amount of <lb/>intracellular 3 H-ALN will remain the same in wild-type, SLC37A3 KO and ATRAID KO cells, <lb/>but 3 H-ALN will not be able to exit lysosomes in knockout cells. To detect this potential <lb/>shift in the subcellular distribution of 3 H-ALN in knockout cells, we used digitonin to <lb/>selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of 3 H-ALN treated cells and generated a <lb/>cytosolic fraction and a membranous fraction, which contained intact membrane-bound <lb/>organelles (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1A) (Liu and Fagotto, 2011). We observed that <lb/>the distribution of radioactive signal changed from being primarily in the cytosolic <lb/>fraction in wild-type cells to being predominantly in membranous fractions in <lb/>SLC37A3 KO and ATRAID KO cells (Figure 4B), suggesting that 3 H-ALN cannot be <lb/>released from membrane-bound organelles in knockout cells. As our model specifically <lb/>predicts that 3 H-ALN will be trapped in lysosomes in the absence of SLC37A3 or <lb/>ATRAID, we affinity-purified lysosomes from 3 H-ALN treated cells (Figure 4 -figure <lb/>supplement 1B-D) (Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017; Wyant et al., 2017) to assess the <lb/>lysosomal accumulation of 3 H-ALN. As our model predicted, we observed a significant <lb/>enrichment of 3 H-ALN in lysosomes purified from knockout cells compared to those from <lb/>wild-type cells (Figure 4C). Additionally, consistent with the observation that ATRAID is <lb/>required for the stable expression of SLC37A3, ATRAID KO cells phenocopied <lb/>SLC37A3 KO cells in these uptake assays. Taken together, our results suggest that N-<lb/>BPs traffic to lysosomes after internalization through endocytosis, and SLC37A3 and <lb/></body>

			<body>ATRAID form a lysosomal transporter complex that releases N-BP molecules from the <lb/>lumen of lysosomes into the cytosol. <lb/>In summary, this study elucidates the route by which N-BPs enter the cytosol and <lb/>inhibit their molecular target. As a recent study has proposed that patients who harbor a <lb/>genetic variant of GGPS1 might be more prone to the side-effects of N-BP treatment <lb/>(Roca-Ayats et al., 2017), it is possible that patients with variants of SLC37A3 or <lb/>ATRAID, which are genes crucial for the action of N-BPs, might also exhibit non-<lb/>canonical responsiveness to the drugs. Therefore, our results may bear significant <lb/>relevance to the clinical applications of N-BPs. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Materials.

K562 human myeloid leukemia cells, Human Embryo <lb/>Kidney (HEK) 293T cells and RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cells were obtained <lb/>from ATCC and tested for mycoplasma contamination. K562 cells were cultured in <lb/>RPMI supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, 2 g/L NaHCO 3 , 10% FBS <lb/>and Penicillin/Streptomycin; HEK 293T cells and RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in <lb/>DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cultures were <lb/>maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . <lb/>Unbiased whole-genome CRISPRi screen. K562 cell line generation, genome-scale <lb/>library design and cloning, virus production, and bioinformatic analysis were conducted <lb/>as previously described (Gilbert et al., 2014; Jost et al., 2017). In summary, K562 cells <lb/>stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were transduced in duplicate with the v1 CRISPRi <lb/>sgRNA library to achieve ~30% infection to ensure no more than one viral integration <lb/>event per cell.

Cells were maintained at a <lb/>density of 500,000 to 1,000,000 cells/mL in 2-liter cultures to ensure a library coverage <lb/>of at least 1000 cells per sgRNA during the entire screening period. Genomic DNA was <lb/>collected from all harvested samples and the genomic regions containing the inserted <lb/>sgRNAs were amplified for 20 cycles by PCR and sequenced at 800× coverage on <lb/>Ilumina HiSeq-2500 using custom primers as previously described (Kampmann et al., <lb/>2013). <lb/>For data analysis, sequencing reads were aligned to the v1 CRISPRi library sequences, <lb/>counted, and quantified using the Python-based ScreenProcessing pipeline (Horlbeck et <lb/>al., 2016). Sensitivity phenotypes (ρ) were calculated by computing the log2 difference <lb/>in enrichment of each sgRNA between the treated and untreated samples, subtracting <lb/>the equivalent median value for all non-targeting sgRNAs, and dividing by the number of <lb/>population doubling differences between the treated and untreated populations(Gilbert <lb/>et al., 2014; Jost et al., 2017). Similarly, untreated growth phenotypes (γ) were <lb/>calculated from the untreated endpoint samples and t 0 samples, dividing by the total <lb/>number of doublings of the untreated population. Phenotypes from sgRNAs targeting <lb/>the same gene were collapsed into a single sensitivity phenotype for each gene using <lb/>the average of the top three scoring sgRNAs (by absolute value) and assigned a P-<lb/>value using the Mann-Whitney test of all sgRNAs targeting the same gene compared to <lb/>the non-targeting controls (Supplementary Data Table 1). For genes with multiple <lb/>independent transcription start sites (TSSs) targeted by the sgRNA libraries, <lb/>phenotypes and P-values were calculated independently for each TSS and then <lb/>collapsed to a single score by selecting the TSS with the lowest Mann-Whitney P-value. <lb/></body>

For the human SLC37A3 locus, one sgRNA targeting intron 5 and another <lb/>targeting intron 6 were used to act simultaneously and remove the entire exon 6, which <lb/>contains 146bp of CDS. For murine SLC37A3 locus, two sgRNAs targeting exon 2 were <lb/>designed to cause microdeletions and frameshifts in the CDS. sgRNAs were cloned into <lb/>PX458 for co-expression with Cas9. <lb/>sgRNA_human_ATRAID_exon3_1: <lb/>GCCTGATGAAAGTTTGGACC <lb/>sgRNA_human_ATRAID_exon3_2: <lb/>CCCTGGTCCAAACTTTCATC <lb/>sgRNA_human_ATRAID_exon5: <lb/>GTCCTGGAGGAATTAATGCC <lb/>sgRNA_human_SLC37A3_intron5_1: <lb/>GTGTGAGTGTATCCTTCACG <lb/>sgRNA_human_SLC37A3_intron5_2: <lb/>GCCAGTGCCTGTAAGTCACG <lb/>sgRNA_human_SLC37A3_intron6: <lb/>GTAGCAAGTCAGAGTTGTTCA <lb/>sgRNA_mouse_ <lb/>SLC37A3_exon1_1: <lb/>TCTCTGCAAAAATCGTGGCC <lb/>sgRNA_mouse_ SLC37A3_exon1_2: TGTTCCTGCTCACGTTCTTC <lb/>For K562 and HEK 293T cells, on day one, 500,000 cells were seeded onto a 6 cm <lb/>dish. 24 hours later, cells were transfected with 1.25 µg of PX458 construct for each <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1 An unbiased CRISPRi screen identifies genetic targets of alendronate. (A) <lb/>Schematic illustrating the workflow of the genome-wide CRISPRi screen. The IC50 of <lb/>alendronate in K562 cells is 250 μM. (B) Volcano plot showing, for each gene, a ρ score <lb/>that averages the normalized fold enrichment (in the treated population compared to the <lb/>untreated control) of the gene&apos;s three most effective sgRNAs, and a Mann-Whitney P-<lb/>value for fold enrichment (Gilbert et al., 2014). The dashed lines represent thresholds <lb/>used to identify significant hits. Positive ρ scores correspond to resistance hits and <lb/>negative scores to sensitizing hits. (C) Gene names and annotated functions of the top 7 <lb/>resistance and sensitizing hits. Genes are sorted by the absolute values of their ρ scores <lb/>in descending order. SLC37A3 is marked in bold. (D) Diagram of the mevalonate <lb/>pathway, with genes in the pathway that were identified as significant hits marked with <lb/>their ρ scores. Resistance hits are color-coded in red and sensitizing hits in blue. <lb/>Figure 1 -figure supplement 1 Additional analysis of the whole-genome CRISPRi screen. <lb/>(A) Evaluation of the reproducibility of the CRISPRi screen. The enrichment score (ρ) of each <lb/>sgRNA was calculated separately from two biological replicates of the CRISPRi screen and <lb/>compared in a scatter plot. Data points corresponding to negative control sgRNAs are colored in <lb/>gray. (B) Quantile-quantile plot comparing the distribution of observed average sgRNA <lb/>enrichment scores (ρ scores) of each gene in the genome with a Gaussian distribution that has <lb/>the same mean and standard deviation. The dashed gray line represents the predicted location <lb/>of data points if the distribution of ρ scores is indeed Gaussian. The large deviations from the gray <lb/>line observed at the two ends of the distribution indicate that the silencing of those genes has <lb/>stronger effects than expected by pure Gaussian noise and is therefore likely to be biologically <lb/>meaningful. The dotted lines are arbitrary thresholds set to select resistance hits (red dotted line) <lb/>and sensitizing hits (blue dotted line) that deviate significantly from Gaussian predictions. 398 <lb/>resistance hits and 28 sensitizing hits passed the thresholds. (C-D) Gene Ontology (GO) pathway <lb/>enrichment analysis of the top 100 resistance hits (C) and the top 30 sensitizing hits (D) identified <lb/>in the CRISPRi screen. Only the most specific subclasses that are statistically significant are <lb/>shown. Both fold enrichment of pathway genes and P-values of fold enrichment are displayed. <lb/>Fold enrichment values were clipped at 100 fold. P-values were corrected for multiple testing <lb/>using Bonferroni correction. Note that genes involved in the mevalonate pathway, which includes <lb/>IPP biosynthesis, geranyl phosphate synthesis and farnesyl phosphate synthesis, are significantly <lb/>enriched in top hits from the screen. IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate. (E) Volcano plot showing <lb/>the results from a second CRISPRi screen using zoledronate, another representative N-BP, as <lb/>the selection agent. Plot layout is the same as in Figure 1B. SLC37A3 and ATRAID are highlighted <lb/>in red and cyan, respectively. Significant hits were defined as genes that had a fold enrichment <lb/>with an absolute value larger than 0.1, and a P-value smaller than 0.05. <lb/>Figure 2 SLC37A3 and ATRAID are functionally related genes required for the mechanism <lb/>of action of N-BPs. (A-D) Dose response curves of wild-type, ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO K562 <lb/>cells (A) and HEK 293T cells (B), and wild-type and SLC37A3 KO RAW cells (both undifferentiated <lb/>macrophages, C, and differentiated osteoclasts, D) to alendronate. Cells were treated with a <lb/>series of doses of alendronate (x-axis) for 48 hours. Relative cell viability was determined by <lb/>measuring post-treatment total cellular ATP levels and normalizing to those in untreated cells (y-<lb/>axis). Data depict mean with s.d. for biological triplicate measurements. (E) Immunoblots <lb/>measuring alendronate-induced reduction in protein prenylation in wild-type and knockout K562 <lb/>and HEK 293T cells. Cells were treated with indicated doses of alendronate for 24 hours before <lb/>analysis by immunoblotting. (F) Immunoblots comparing alendronate-induced reduction in protein <lb/>prenylation in single and double-knockout HEK 293T cells. Experimental procedure is as in C. <lb/>Note that higher alendronate doses were used in F compared to E to induce detectable levels of <lb/>unprenylated proteins. ALN: alendronate. <lb/>Figure 2 -figure supplement 1 Genotypes of knockout cells used in this study. (A-F) <lb/>Sequences of the ATRAID (A, C and F) or SLC37A3 locus (B, D and E) in ATRAID KO (A) and <lb/>SLC37A3 KO (B) K562 cells, ATRAID KO (C), SLC37A3 KO (D) and KO 2 (F) HEK 293T cells, and <lb/>SLC37A3 KO (E) RAW 264.7 cells, showing that truncations in ATRAID and SLC37A3 coding <lb/>sequences (CDS) have caused frame shifts in the knockout cell lines. The SLC37A3 locus in KO 2 <lb/>HEK 293T cells is identical to that in SLC37A3 KO HEK 293T cells. Introns and exons are not drawn <lb/>to scale. Note that more than 2 alleles are present for the SLC37A3 locus in HEK 293T cells as <lb/>these cells are hypo-triploidic. KO 2 : ATRAID KO ; SLC37A3 KO . <lb/>Figure 2 -figure supplement 2 Additional evidence that validates SLC37A3 and ATRAID <lb/>as functionally related genes required for the mechanism of action of N-BPs. (A) Expression <lb/>of osteoclast markers (Ctsk, Rank and Trap) in undifferentiated RAW macrophages (Mφ) and <lb/>differentiated RAW osteoclasts (OC), demonstrating successful differentiation of RAW cells. (B-<lb/>C) Dose responses to alendronate in SLC37A3 KO or ATRAID KO HEK 293T cells complemented <lb/>with epitope tagged SLC37A3 or ATRAID, respectively, compared with those in wild-type, <lb/>ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO cells. (D) Immunoblot comparing the short isoform of ATRAID <lb/>(sATRAID) with the long isoform of ATRAID (lATRAID), showing that the long isoform of ATRAID <lb/>is expressed as the same protein as the short isoform of ATRAID. Note that unequal amount of <lb/>protein was loaded in each lane to obtain even exposure. The amount of protein loaded from left <lb/>to right was: 100 µg, 40 µg, 10 µg and 4 µg, respectively. (E-F) Dose response curves of wild-<lb/>type, ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO HEK 293T cells to nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates (E) and <lb/>non-nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates (F). (G-H) Dose response curves of wild-type, <lb/>ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO K562 cells (G) and HEK 293T cells (H) to lovastatin. (I) Immunoblots <lb/>measuring lovastatin-induced reduction in protein prenylation in wild-type, ATRAID KO and <lb/>SLC37A3 KO K562 cells and HEK 293T cells. (J) Dose response to alendronate in KO 2 HEK 293T <lb/>cells, compared with those in wild-type, ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO cells. For B-C, E-H and J, <lb/>data depict mean with s.d. for biological triplicate measurements. LOV: lovastatin. KO 2 : <lb/>ATRAID KO ; SLC37A3 KO . PNGase F: peptide: N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that removes <lb/>asparagine (N)-linked sugar modifications on glycoproteins. <lb/>Figure 3 SLC37A3 and ATRAID form a lysosomal complex and are inter-dependent for their <lb/>stable expression. (A-D) Localization of HA-tagged SLC37A3 (SLC37A3-HA) (A-B) and V5-<lb/>tagged short isoform of ATRAID (sATRAID-V5) (C-D) shown with markers for lysosomes (LAMP2, <lb/>A and C) and the plasma membrane (Na + /K + -ATPase, B and D). (E) Co-localization of SLC37A3-<lb/>HA and sATRAID-V5. Nuclei were stained with DAPI in blue. Scale bars represent 10 µm. Each <lb/>image displayed is the representative example chosen from at least five similar images. (F) <lb/>Reciprocal co-IP of SLC37A3A3-HA and sATRAID-V5 in KO 2 HEK 293T cells stably <lb/>overexpressing both proteins. In each negative control cell line, one of the two tagged proteins <lb/>was replaced with GFP tagged with the same epitope. (G) Immunoblots measuring SLC37A3-HA <lb/>protein levels in various cells, showing that deletion of ATRAID significantly reduces the protein <lb/>level of SLC37A3-HA. The un-glycosylated population of SLC37A3 that appears in the absence <lb/>of ATRAID is marked with an asterisk. (H) Immunoblots measuring ATRAID-V5 protein levels in <lb/>various cells, demonstrating that deletion of SLC37A3 significantly reduces the protein level of <lb/>ATRAID-V5. IP, immunoprecipitation. IB, immunoblot. KO 2 : ATRAID KO ; SLC37A3 KO . <lb/>Figure 3 -figure supplement 1 Additional evidence supporting that SLC37A3 and ATRAID <lb/>form a lysosomal complex. (A) mRNA levels of ATRAID and SLC37A3 in various HEK 293T <lb/>cells used in this study. Data depict mean and s.d. for technical triplicate measurements. (B) Dose <lb/>responses to alendronate in KO 2 HEK 293T cells complemented with either only SLC37A3-HA or <lb/>both ATRAID-V5 and SLC37A3-HA, compared with those in wild-type and KO 2 HEK 293T cells. <lb/>Data depict mean and s.d. for biological triplicate measurements. (C-H) Localization of SLC37A3-<lb/>HA (C), sATRAID-V5 (D) or lATRAID-V5 (F-H) shown with LAMP2 (F), EEA1 (C, D and H) and <lb/>Na + /K + -ATPase (G), and co-localization of SLC37A3-HA and lATRAID-V5 (E). Scale bars <lb/>represent 10 µm. Each image displayed is the representative example chosen from at least five <lb/>similar images. Note that in E, there exists a subpopulation of lATRAID-V5 that localizes to the <lb/>plasma membrane but not with SLC37A3-HA. Such distribution is likely a result of a higher-than-<lb/>endogenous expression level of lATRAID-V5 in KO 2 + SLC37A3-HA + lATRAID-V5 HEK 293T <lb/>cells (A), as such distribution is not observed in ATRAID KO + lATRAID-V5 HEK 293T cells (G), <lb/>which express lATRAID-V5 at a lower-than-endogenous level (A). KO 2 : ATRAID KO ; SLC37A3 KO . <lb/>sATRAID: short isoform of ATRAID. lATRAID: long isoform of ATRAID. <lb/>Figure 3 -figure supplement 2 Additional evidence supporting that SLC37A3 and ATRAID <lb/>depend on each other for stable expression. (A-C) Analysis of IF images comparing the <lb/>expression levels of SLC37A3-HA (A) or both isoforms of ATRAID-V5 (B and C) in their respective <lb/>single knockout backgrounds and the KO 2 background. The two images in each sub-figure were <lb/>acquired with the same setting and adjusted to the same contrast. In each image a background <lb/>area (turquoise or blue, inside nuclei, where no stain should be present) and a signal area (orange <lb/>or red) were selected and the distribution of pixel values within each area was plotted in a <lb/>histogram. The outlines in the histogram are color-coded to match the boarders of selected areas. <lb/>(D-E) Polysome profiling experiment assessing the translation efficiency of SLC37A3 transcripts <lb/>in SLC37A3 KO and KO 2 backgrounds. Lysates from indicated cell lines were analyzed on a <lb/>gradient station and fractionated into five fractions: untranslated transcripts (UT), small and large <lb/>ribosome subunits (SL), lowly translated transcripts (LT), medially translated transcripts (MT) and <lb/>highly translated transcripts (HT). The level of SLC37A3 transcripts relative to the level of TBP <lb/>(TATA-binding protein) transcripts in each fraction was measured and plotted. The SL fraction <lb/>was excluded from the analysis. A total RNA fraction was included as a reference. No overall shift <lb/>was observed in the distribution of SLC37A3 transcripts in the KO 2 background compared to that <lb/>in the SLC37A3 KO background, suggesting that the translation efficiency of SLC37A3 is not <lb/>affected by the absence of ATRAID. (F) Immunoblot comparing the glycosylation patterns of <lb/>SLC37A3 in SLC37A3 KO and KO 2 backgrounds. Lysates from SLC37A3 KO + SLC37A3-HA (lane <lb/>1-3) and KO 2 + SLC37A3-HA (lane 4-6) HEK 293T cells were left untreated (lane 1 and 4), treated <lb/>with PNGase-F (lane 2 and 5), or with Endo H (lane 3 and 6). The band corresponding to an un-<lb/>glycosylated population of SLC37A3 that is present in the absence of ATRAID but not in the <lb/>presence of ATRAD is marked with an asterisk. (G) Immunoblot comparing the glycosylation <lb/>patterns of total cellular SLC37A3 and the sub-population of SLC37A3 that interacts with ATRAID. <lb/>In KO 2 HEK 293T cells over-expressing SLC37A3-HA and sATRAID-V5, proteins that interact <lb/>with sATRAID-V5 were purified with immuno-precipitation against V5 epitope and compared with <lb/>total proteins in the lysate. The pre-IP total lysate (lane 1-2) and anti-V5 IP eluate (lane 3-4) were <lb/>either left untreated (lane 1 and 3) or treated with PNGase F (lane 2 and 4) and analyzed by <lb/>blotting against SLC37A3-HA. IF: immunofluorescence. IB: immunoblot. KO 2 : ATRAID KO ; <lb/>SLC37A3 KO . PNGase F: peptide: N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that removes all asparagine (N)-<lb/>linked sugar modifications from glycoproteins. Endo H: endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that only <lb/>removes high mannose sugar moieties on ER glycoproteins that have not been processed by the <lb/>Golgi apparatus. <lb/>Figure 4 SLC37A3 and ATRAID transport alendronate from the lumen of lysosomes into <lb/>the cytosol.

Data depict mean and s.d. for biological triplicate <lb/>measurements. (B) Radioactive uptake assay measuring levels of radioactivity in subcellular <lb/>fractions in indicated HEK 293T cells treated with 3 H-alendronate. Data depict mean with s.d. for <lb/>biological duplicate measurements. Significance was determined using unpaired two-way <lb/>ANOVA test. Effect of genotype: F(2,6) = 74.93, P &lt; 0.0001; effect of subcellular location: F(1,6) <lb/>= 864.9, P &lt; 0.0001; effect of interaction between genotype and subcellular location: F(2,6) = <lb/>312.4, P &lt; 0.0001. (C) Radioactive uptake assay measuring levels of radioactivity in lysosomes <lb/>purified from indicated HEK 293T cells treated with 3 H-alendronate. Data depict mean and s.d. <lb/>for biological triplicate measurements. Significance was determined using two-tailed unpaired t-<lb/>test with equal s.d. Comparison between wild-type and ATRAID KO cells: df =4, t = 36.24, P &lt; <lb/>0.0001. Comparison between wild-type and SLC37A3 KO cells: df = 4, t = 17.96, P &lt; 0.0001. HEK <lb/>293T cells were treated with 1 μCi/mL 3 H-alendronate for 24 hours in A-B and 3 hours in C. ****: <lb/>P &lt; 0.0001. <lb/>Figure 4 -figure supplement 1 Quality controls for the radioactive uptake assays. (A) <lb/>Immunoblot against markers for cytosol (GAPDH), plasma membrane (Caveolin1), early <lb/>endosome (EEA1), lysosome (LAMP1), nucleosol (RaN-BP3), and nucleoskeleton (LaminB1) in <lb/>cytosolic fractions and membranous fractions in wild-type, ATRAID KO and SLC37A3 KO HEK 293T <lb/>cells, demonstrating successful subcellular fractionation in the fractionation-based radioactive <lb/>uptake assay.
