Availability of hosts such as mice and vectors such as Anophe-<lb/>les stephensi has made this parasite a suitable system to study the parasite-host and vector-<lb/>parasite relationships. <lb/>Methods: This study was performed at Medical Entomology and Parasitology laborato-<lb/>ries of the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran in 2016. <lb/>The investigation was carried out to describe life cycle and parameters influencing <lb/>maintenance of the parasite within the mice or the mosquito. <lb/>Results: Results have revealed details and addressed some parameters and points influ-<lb/>ence maintenance of various life stages of the parasite including merozoites, <lb/>macrogametocytes, ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites in the laboratory model P. berghei-<lb/>A. stephensi-BALB/c mouse. Injection of fresh infected blood results in higher <lb/>gametocytemia in the animals. The more injected parasites result in earlier and higher <lb/>parasitemia and exfelagellation centers in the mice blood. However, the highest number <lb/>of infected mosquitoes and oocysts formation were observed when the parasitemia and <lb/>exflagellation centers per microscopic field were 9% and 3.6 in the infected mice respec-<lb/>tively. The infected mosquitoes should be maintained on 8% (w/v) fructose, 0.05% <lb/>(w/v) PABA at 20±1 °C and 50%-80% relative humidity. <lb/>Conclusion: This study helps to understand the biology of vertebrate-parasite and mos-<lb/>quito-malaria interactions that may aid in the development of a new generation of <lb/>drug/vaccine and vector-based measures for malaria control. <lb/>Keywords: <lb/>Plasmodium berghei, <lb/>Anopheles stephensi, <lb/>BALB/c, <lb/>Malaria, <lb/>Lifecycle <lb/>* Correspondence <lb/>Email: <lb/>moshaghi@sina.tums.ac.ir <lb/>Iranian Society of Parasitology <lb/>http://isp.tums.ac.ir <lb/>Iran J Parasitol <lb/>Open access Journal at <lb/>http://ijpa.tums.ac.ir <lb/>Tehran University of Medical <lb/>Sciences Publication <lb/>http://tums.ac.ir <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>alaria remains one of the most <lb/>prevalent tropical and infectious <lb/>diseases in the world, with an es-<lb/>timated more than 200 million clinical cases <lb/>every year (1). Attempts to restrict disease <lb/>transmission have focused on using imagicides <lb/>and adulticides to kill the larvae and adult <lb/>mosquito vectors accordingly, the develop-<lb/>ment of drugs to treat infected individuals, <lb/>and hindering vector-human contact using <lb/>physical barriers and repellents. The Plasmodi-<lb/>um life cycle requires two different organisms <lb/>to survive and develop: the vertebrate host <lb/>and the female of Anopheles mosquitoes (1, 2). <lb/>In recent years, transmission-blocking strat-<lb/>egies (TBS) are considered as a potential target <lb/>for malaria control focused on mosquito stag-<lb/>es of malaria parasites. The three main TBS <lb/>included gametocytocidal drugs, transmission-<lb/>blocking vaccines, and replacing wild mosqui-<lb/>toes with the ones harboring refractory traits. <lb/>The first strategy is focused on exploring the <lb/>gametocytocidal activity of commercially <lb/>available anti-malarial drugs. The second TBS <lb/>is based on immunological attack on sexual or <lb/>mosquito stages of the parasite life cycle using <lb/>different antigens including surface proteins of <lb/>gametocytes and gametes, zygotes and ooki-<lb/>netes, as well as, antigens in the mosquito <lb/>midgut surface such as calreticulin and alanyl <lb/>aminopeptidase (AnAPN1), and other mole-<lb/>cules such as chitinase (3-9). Some of these <lb/>vaccine candidates are currently in preclinical <lb/>phase and being considered for the first trials <lb/>in humans (10). The third TBS is founded on <lb/>changing the mosquito population towards a <lb/>Plasmodium-resistant vector phenotype using <lb/>an effector molecule triggering malaria refrac-<lb/>toriness. Some of effector molecules were <lb/>shown promising including phospholipase A2 <lb/>(PLA2) to inhibit ookinete invasion and SM1 <lb/>thought to block recognition sites for sporo-<lb/>zoites and ookinetes (11, 12). Introduction of <lb/>effector molecules can be achieved by releas-<lb/>ing genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes <lb/>(13), naturally refractory mosquitoes (11), arti-<lb/>ficial gene drive mechanisms (14, 15) and <lb/>third-party modified organisms (paratransgen-<lb/>esis). The third party could be a symbiotic bacte-<lb/>rium or fungus (16-20), and even viruses (21), <lb/>modified to express effector molecule/s inside <lb/>the mosquitoes. The midgut microbiome of <lb/>some Anopheles is characterized and could be <lb/>used as paratransgenesis means (22-27). <lb/>To assess the effectiveness of potential TBS <lb/>that are able to disrupt the life cycle of the <lb/>parasite in the mosquito vector, most studies <lb/>have focused on P. falciparum and P. berghei and <lb/>on the African mosquito, A. gambiae, and the <lb/>Asian mosquito, A. stephensi. However, P. <lb/>berghei-A. stephensi system is widely used when <lb/>studying mosquito-Plasmodium interactions <lb/>since P. berghei is a rodent malaria species, safe, <lb/>unable of infecting humans, its manageability <lb/>and exceptional robustness (28, 29). Numer-<lb/>ous studies have described establishment of P. <lb/>berghei life cycle and the rate of successful de-<lb/>velopment from one life stage to the next <lb/>within the mosquito and vertebrate hosts. <lb/>Since every developmental transition of the <lb/>parasite exhibits strong level of success, here <lb/>we tried to reveal essential requirements and <lb/>optimized situation for a P. berghei-A. stephensi-<lb/>BALB/c mouse laboratory model. Under-<lb/>standing the impact of variables influencing <lb/>on life stage of the parasite is important to <lb/>compare between potential TBS and their <lb/>evaluations. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>The host and vector <lb/>All gametocytes were raised in BALB/c mice <lb/>and transmitted to A. stephensi strain Beech, <lb/>where maintained at 20±1 °C and 50%-80% <lb/>RH and fed on 8% fructose/0.05% para-amino-<lb/>benzoic acid (PABA) (28). The mice were used <lb/>to feed 24 h starved 3-5 d-old A. stephensi fe-<lb/>males for 30 min. In these experiments, more <lb/>than 50 fed mosquitoes were assayed per sample. <lb/>M <lb/></body>

			<body>24-h after feeding, unfed mosquitoes were re-<lb/>moved by aspirator. Mosquitoes were then <lb/>maintained on fructose [8% (w/v) fructose, <lb/>0.05% (w/v) PABA] at 20±1 °C and 50%-80% <lb/>relative humidity. Day 9-10 post-feeding, mid-<lb/>guts of a subset of lived specimens were dissect-<lb/>ed in a drop 0.5% mercurochrome and their <lb/>midguts examined for oocysts by light micros-<lb/>copy. The remainder of each mosquito batch <lb/>was incubated a further 8-10 d before counting <lb/>the salivary gland sporozoites. <lb/>The parasite <lb/>We followed the protocols previously de-<lb/>scribed (30). To avoid the effect of parasite <lb/>genetic variability, we used clones of the ro-<lb/>dent malarial parasite P. berghei clone ANKA <lb/>2.34, a gift from Prof. Marcelo Jacob-Lorena <lb/>of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Pub-<lb/>lic Health, Department of Molecular Microbi-<lb/>ology and Immunology, Malaria Research In-<lb/>stitute, Baltimore, USA. <lb/>All procedures were performed in accordance <lb/>with the terms of the Iran Animals (Scientific <lb/>Procedures) Act Project License and were ap-<lb/>proved by the Tehran University of Medical Sci-<lb/>ences Ethical Review Committee (No. 26231). <lb/>The parasites were maintained in 4-10 wk <lb/>old female BALB/c mice by serial mechanical <lb/>passages (up to a maximum of 8 passages). To <lb/>keep gametocyte infectivity to the mosquitoes, <lb/>hyper-reticulocytosis was induced 2-3 d be-<lb/>fore infection by treating mice with 100 μL <lb/>intraperitoneal (i.p.) phenylhydrazinium chlo-<lb/>ride (PH; 10 mg/mL in PBS) per 10 g mouse. <lb/>Mice infections were monitored on Giemsa-<lb/>stained tail-blood smears. Infections in mice <lb/>were done on d 2-5 when a low but rising <lb/>gametocytaemia succeeded (31). <lb/>Results <lb/>We only addressed the hints and fine details <lb/>normally not indicated exclusively in literature. <lb/>Impact of anesthetic materials on BALB/c <lb/>The impact of kind of anesthetized materials <lb/>on development of the parasite within mice, we <lb/>tested two chemicals: Acepromazine and mix <lb/>of Rompun® (Xylazine) and Vetalar® (Keta-<lb/>min) (1:Xylazine /2: Ketamin/3: PBS). We in-<lb/>jected intraperitoneal (i.p.) 50 μl (per mouse 15 <lb/>gr) of the chemicals which anesthetizes the ani-<lb/>mal for 30-45 min. Acepromazine caused con-<lb/>siderable reduction in the animal body tempera-<lb/>ture. This hindered the parasite development <lb/>within the animal and also the cold animal was <lb/>not attractive for mosquitoes to take blood meal. <lb/>Hyper-reticulocytosis in BALB/c mice <lb/>Hyper-reticulocytosis was induced 2-3 d be-<lb/>fore infection by treating the mice with 100 μl <lb/>(10 mg/mL in PBS) intraperitoneal (i.p.) <lb/>phenylhydrazinium chloride (PH). Treating the <lb/>BALB/c mice with 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) <lb/>phenylhydrazinium chloride (PH; 10 mg/mL in <lb/>PBS) per 10 g animal weight was enough to <lb/>induce hyper-reticulocytosis in the animals. <lb/>Parasite storage <lb/>To store parasite-infected blood for further <lb/>experiments it is recommended to use cardiac <lb/>puncture method to harvest blood samples <lb/>from infected mice. The blood should be col-<lb/>lected into heparinized tubes and was immedi-<lb/>ately mixed with equal volume of PBS (30% <lb/>glycerin), transferred to freezer (-20 °C) for 30 <lb/>min, and then stored in -196 °C. It is possible <lb/>to harvest 1.2 -1.3 and up to 1.7 ml blood <lb/>from a BALB/c mouse weight 15-25 g. <lb/>Injection of fresh/frozen infectious blood <lb/>The frozen infectious blood is used to infect <lb/>noninfected mouse by injection of 200-300 <lb/>uli.p. infected blood to a new mouse (20-25 g). <lb/>It is recommended to thaw the frozen blood, <lb/>incubate at room temperature up to 37 °C for <lb/>a few minutes prior to injection. To make <lb/>proper infection using infected frozen blood, <lb/>it is recommended to inject the blood as soon <lb/>as possible without treating the mice with PH. <lb/>Appropriate parasitemia will appear in the <lb/>mice several days post frozen-blood injection <lb/>that is much later than the ones received fresh <lb/>infected blood (Fig. 1). <lb/></body>

This <lb/>helps to keep the animal body warm enough <lb/>and nullify cooling effect of the anesthetic <lb/>compounds. Totally, 20-30 min is enough for <lb/>most (&gt;90%) of females to take blood meal. <lb/>The fed mosquitoes should be maintained on <lb/>8% (w/v) fructose, 0.05% (w/v) PABA at <lb/>20±1 °C and 50%-80% relative humidity <lb/>through the experiments. The fructose-PABA <lb/>vial should be changed every two days. The <lb/>vial stocks should be kept at 20 °C before use. <lb/>Usually, about 60%-80% of fed females will <lb/>be alive 15-20 d post blood meal at optimized <lb/>condition. The mosquitoes lay eggs 4-5 d post <lb/>blood meal at 20±1 °C. <lb/>The parasite zygotes and ookinetes could be <lb/>seen accordingly 1 and 24 h after infected <lb/>blood intake. To support survival rate of the <lb/>female mosquitoes, it is recommended to of-<lb/>fer two more blood meals (from a non-<lb/>infected mouse) on day six and 12, following <lb/>laying eggs by the females. Day 9-10 and 20 <lb/>post blood meal is the best time for oocyst <lb/>and sporozoite observation accordingly. Oo-<lb/>cysts can be counted by phase contrast mi-<lb/>croscopy of freshly dissected midguts. Sporo-<lb/>zoites can be similarly counted on days 20 <lb/>onwards by hemocytometry of dissected sali-<lb/>vary glands of alive mosquitoes immediately <lb/>prior to dissection. <lb/>If the mosquitoes had sporozoites they are <lb/>ready for parasite transmission to a new host. <lb/>To ensure transferring the parasites from in-<lb/>fected mosquitoes to a new mouse, although <lb/>theoretically one mosquito is enough, it is rec-<lb/>ommended to use at least 10 infected females <lb/>per mouse because all of the mosquitoes may <lb/>not be infected and one mosquito may not <lb/>able to inoculate enough parasite to the host. <lb/>Younger mice with 10-15 g weight are pre-<lb/>ferred to older ones with more weight for par-<lb/>asite transmission. In our experiments, the P0 <lb/>parasites were observed on day six post mos-<lb/>quito bites in the mice (n=3) who received 13-<lb/>16 mosquito bites. Other mice group (n=3) <lb/>received fewer bites (7-8 and 9-10bites) the <lb/>parasites appeared on average day 15 and 10 <lb/>post mosquito bites accordingly (Fig.7). Fur-<lb/>ther analysis showed that rate of sporozoite <lb/>infection in the mosquitoes used in this exper-<lb/>iment was 80%. <lb/>Following mosquito bites, the sporozoites <lb/>enter the liver cells (hepatocytes) less than an <lb/>hour (30 min), and then after 48 h, the mero-<lb/>zoites form are released into the bloodstream <lb/>to attack red blood cells (RBC). In RBC, they <lb/>replicate asexually in 22-24-h cycle. When par-<lb/>asitemia of P0 reach to 20% in the mice blood, <lb/>the blood could be collected (10 ul blood + 90 <lb/>ul PBS/mouse 15g) and injected to new mice <lb/>to prepare P1 parasites. It takes almost one <lb/>week until the parasites (P1) appears in the <lb/>mice. When the parasitemia (P1) reach 30%-<lb/>50%, the blood can be taken and stored in <lb/>freezer for further investigation. For preparing <lb/>P2 parasites, the mouse blood containing P1 <lb/>parasites with 20%-30% parasitemia could be <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>We have revealed fine details for maintain-<lb/>ing P. berghei-A. stephensi-BALB/c mouse sys-<lb/>tem which is crucial and very helpful for stud-<lb/>ies involving malaria transmission blocking <lb/>assays. Although the system we explained here <lb/>was established for P. berghei-A. stephensi, it has <lb/>the potential applicability to other malaria vec-<lb/>tors. P. berghei is able to complete its life cycle <lb/>in different mosquito species (30, 32, 33). <lb/>However, when studying mosquito-malaria <lb/>interactions, one should consider the vector <lb/>intrinsic factors comprising Anopheles species <lb/>gametocyte activating factor(s), pH, tempera-<lb/>ture, and quality and quantity of blood inges-<lb/>tion which may influence on the mosquito <lb/>infectivity outcome (34, 35). <lb/>We used BALB/c mice as a vertebrate host <lb/>for P. berghei, however, other rodents including <lb/>Swiss Webster mice, Theiler&apos;s Original (TO-<lb/>outbred), and C57BL/6 have been used for <lb/>similar systems. The quality and quantity of <lb/>inhibitory factors present in the infected blood <lb/>of different mice such as antibodies, metabo-<lb/>lites, and cytokines (36, 37) may enhance or <lb/>diminish the mosquito infectivity outcome. <lb/>Further investigation needs to clarify the ef-<lb/>fect of the parasite/host combinations on the <lb/>maintenance of the parasite in vivo (38). <lb/>For the lab with less security level, this sys-<lb/>tem present here is preferred to the systems <lb/>use P. falciparum since P. berghei is a rodent ma-<lb/>laria species and is safe and unable of infecting <lb/>humans (29). However, the systems involved <lb/>human <lb/>malaria <lb/>species <lb/>such <lb/>as <lb/>A.stephensi/A.gambiae-P. falciparum might vary <lb/>from the rodent system we present here par-<lb/>ticularly in the gametocytemia and the mosqui-<lb/>to infectivity. <lb/>In our experiments, the number of infec-<lb/>tious parasites ingested by the mosquito from <lb/>the mouse has great effect on the success of <lb/>Plasmodium infection in the mosquitoes. Alt-<lb/>hough the number oocystes increased in the <lb/>mosquitoes fed on high parasitemic mouse, <lb/>number of infectious mosquitoes reduced in-<lb/>tensely which is in accordance with the finding <lb/>of other researchers (35, 39-44). Therefore it <lb/>is highly recommended for researchers who <lb/>use P. berghei-systems to use infected mouse or <lb/>its infected blood with low gametocyte densi-<lb/>ties (2-3 exflagellation centers per microscopic <lb/>field) when they evaluate TBS and calculate <lb/>value of interventions. Here we showed that <lb/>more inoculated sporozoites accelerate the <lb/>parasitemia in the host. In addition to the <lb/>number of mosquito bites, the number of in-<lb/>oculated sporozoites and the host-related fac-<lb/>tors may affect the quality and quantity of par-<lb/>asitemia in the host. This is in agreement with <lb/>previous studies indicating the positive rela-<lb/>tionship between parasitemia and number of <lb/>infected mosquito bites or sporozoites (31, 45, <lb/>46). <lb/>The results of this study showed that be-<lb/>tween the two parameters of parasitemia and <lb/>exflagellation centers, number of exflagellation <lb/>centers has more influence on the rate of in-<lb/>fected mosquitoes and proper number of oo-<lb/>cyst formation. However, this depends on <lb/>mosquito strain, amount of blood intake by <lb/>mosquito, number of active gametocytes in <lb/>the blood, and some other unknown factors in <lb/>the blood (8, 47). <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The results of this study showed that various <lb/>factors influence on the maintenance of P. <lb/>berghei-A. stephensi-BALB/c mouse system. <lb/>This information helps to understand the bi-<lb/>ology of vertebrate-parasite and mosquito-<lb/>malaria interactions that may aid in the devel-<lb/>opment of a new generation of drug/vaccine <lb/>and vector-based measures for malaria con-<lb/>trol. <lb/></body>
