Knösche <lb/>Received: date / Accepted: date <lb/> Abstract Neural responses to sudden changes can be <lb/>observed in many parts of the sensory pathways at dif-<lb/>ferent organizational levels. For example, deviants that <lb/>violate regularity at various levels of abstraction can <lb/>be observed as simple On/Off responses of individual <lb/>neurons or as cumulative responses of neural popula-<lb/>tions. The cortical deviance-related responses support-<lb/>ing different functionalities (e.g. gap detection, chunk-<lb/>ing, etc.) seem unlikely to arise from different function-<lb/>specific neural circuits, given the relatively uniform and <lb/>self-similar wiring patterns across cortical areas and <lb/>spatial scales. Additionally, reciprocal wiring patterns <lb/>(with heterogeneous combinations of excitatory and in-<lb/>hibitory connections) in the cortex naturally speak in <lb/>favor of a generic deviance detection principle. Based on <lb/>this concept, we propose a network model consisting of <lb/>reciprocally coupled neural masses as a blueprint of a <lb/>universal change detector.

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Automatic detection of sudden acoustic changes cru-<lb/>cially enables reorientation of attention towards rele-<lb/>vant events in the environment and thereby is impor-<lb/>tant for survival. From a functional perspective, the <lb/>sensitivity to deviants at the various levels serves differ-<lb/>ent functionalities (e.g. noise rejection, duration tuning, <lb/>chunking and grouping, beat perception, see reviews <lb/>in [58, 106]) and enriches the hierarchical representa-<lb/>tions of percepts. The ability to detect abrupt tempo-<lb/>ral changes is thought to be a pervasive property of the <lb/>sensory systems, given that deviance-related responses <lb/>have been widely observed from cellular to system lev-<lb/>els, across species, sensory modalities, and spanning <lb/>from the lower levels of the sensory pathway to the cor-<lb/>tex. For example, some cells can be sensitive only to the <lb/>onsets and offsets of stimuli. These On/Off responses <lb/>have been observed using extracellular recording in the <lb/>superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) of rodents [7, 19, <lb/>21, 44, 47], inferior colliculus (IC) of chinchillas [24], me-<lb/>dial geniculate body (MGB) of the guinea pig [26]. <lb/>Cortical On/Off responses have been observed using <lb/>different recording and imaging techniques, including <lb/>single-cell recording in primary auditory cortex (A1) <lb/>of awake cats [16, 69], and anesthetized rats [80], ex-<lb/>tracellular recording in A1 of awake marmoset mon-<lb/></body>

Generally speaking, these <lb/>cells can be sensitive to the sudden changes in specific <lb/>regular features such as the constancy in pitch, loud-<lb/>ness, duration, and patterns. The deviants that violate <lb/>these perceptual regularities trigger mismatch response <lb/>at different stages such as frequency following responses <lb/>(FFR), middle latency responses (MLR), as well as long <lb/>latency responses (LLR) such as the mismatch nega-<lb/>tivity (MMN) [85]. An omitted stimulus in a periodic <lb/>train of stimuli is a special case of deviants, which elic-<lb/>its the so-called omitted-stimulus responses /potentials <lb/>(OSRs/OSPs). The OSR is time-locked not to the last <lb/>but to the omitted stimulus, which reflects temporal ex-<lb/>pectancy represented in the neural circuits. OSRs have <lb/>been observed in different sensory systems (e.g., visual, <lb/>auditory, somatosensory) in various species, for exam-<lb/>ple, the visual pathway of fish, reptile, and invertebrate <lb/>in vivo [12, 68, 71, 40], retinas of salamander in vitro [83, <lb/>104], and the electrosensory system of rays [14]. The <lb/>OSR at the cortical level (often termed as omission re-<lb/>sponse or omission MMN) has also been observed in hu-<lb/>man EEG/MEG [29, 2, 13, 41, 15]. So far, investigations <lb/>of the underlying mechanisms have been mostly con-<lb/>fined in a certain level and a particular phenomenon. <lb/>A unifying view of deviance detection that considers <lb/>phenomena across levels is still missing. <lb/>Many of the deviance-related activities, though orig-<lb/>inating from different stages of the auditory pathway, <lb/>can be observed pervasively in the auditory cortex. We <lb/>hypothesize that the cortical deviance-related activi-<lb/>ties are primarily generated locally through reciprocally <lb/>connected neural circuits. In this study, we outline a <lb/>generic deviance detection principle, in an effort to rec-<lb/>oncile some confusions and conflictions related to the <lb/>questions below. <lb/>What neural circuits give rise to the diverse <lb/>cortical On/Off responses? The response of a neu-<lb/>ron or a neural circuit to a sustained stimulus can bear <lb/>three basic features: a response to the stimulus onset <lb/>(On response), a sustained response as long the stim-<lb/>ulus is present, and a response to the stimulus offset <lb/>(Off response). The On/Off responses are found in neu-<lb/>rons of the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) of the <lb/>brainstem, the inferior colliculus (IC) of the midbrain <lb/>[22], and the auditory cortex [80, 4, 20]. These On/Off <lb/>neurons are thought to support functions such as du-<lb/>ration selectivity (duration tuning), gap detection, and <lb/>noise rejection [106]. Knowledge in the generation of <lb/>On/Off responses is mainly derived from observations <lb/>at non-cortical stages. The On responses are thought <lb/>to be due to adaptive and post-onset inhibitory mech-<lb/>anisms that shape the responses in the auditory nerve <lb/>[66]. The Off responses are widely accepted to arise from <lb/>post-inhibitory rebound (see review in [43] for the de-<lb/>tailed celluar and synaptic mechanisms), as concluded <lb/>from observation in SPON neurons [21]. Other response <lb/>patterns such as On-Off, On-sustained-Off can then po-<lb/>tentially be explained by mixing of excitatory and in-<lb/>hibitory inputs with different delays in a feed-forward <lb/>network [106]. As for the On/Off responses recorded in <lb/>the auditory cortex, they may originate from the as-<lb/>cending non-cortical On/Off responses [80] or be gen-<lb/>erated locally in the cortex. The cortical On/Off neu-<lb/>rons show diverse temporal profiles [20]. Also, a sin-<lb/>gle cortical neuron may have distinct onset-and offset-<lb/>frequency receptive fields (FRFs) [69]. It is still unclear <lb/>how the neural circuits give rise to these properties of <lb/>cortical On/Off responses. <lb/>Is the OSR just sustained resonance? The OSR, <lb/>elicited by an unexpected omission in periodic stim-<lb/>uli, is found in the cortex [29, 2, 13, 41, 15], but not in <lb/>the midbrain (IC, tectum) [61] and the brainstem [50], <lb/>where only Off responses are observed. The OSR re-<lb/>sembles the Off response as they both peak at the end <lb/>of a stimulus (or a train of stimuli), except that the <lb/>OSR also reflects temporal expectancy (i.e., neural rep-<lb/>resentation of periodicity), which distinguishes it from <lb/>the Off response. The properties of the OSR include: <lb/>(1) The peak latency includes an additional constant <lb/>delay (e.g., around 100 ms in human MEG/EEG) af-<lb/>ter the due-time of the missing stimulus which does <lb/>not depend on the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) of <lb/>stimuli [2, 84]. (2) The peak amplitude can be larger <lb/>than the entrained responses during periodic stimuli <lb/>[29]. Althought neural activities that show sustained <lb/>resonance can be a mechanism underlying the temporal <lb/>expectancy [52, 94], sustained response alone does not <lb/>explain the additional delay and higher peak amplitude. <lb/>How the neural circuits maintain the input periodicity <lb/>and detect the change is unclear. <lb/>Does the OSR reflect prediction or prediction <lb/>error? This question rests on whether the OSR is trig-<lb/>gered by a similar mechanism as the MMN. The MMN, <lb/>elicited by a deviant among repetitive standard stim-<lb/>uli, is a negative deflection in the event-related potential <lb/>(ERP) with the sources most prominently localized in <lb/>the auditory cortex. The underlying process leads to the <lb/>reorientation of attention for higher cognitive processes. <lb/>Deviants which differed in a variety of sound properties <lb/>from the standard have been shown to elicit MMNs, <lb/>for example pitch [78, 95, 56, 93, 108, 109, 33, 64, 63], in-<lb/></body>

The <lb/>MMN is generally accepted to be elicited by the deviant <lb/>that violates the regularities, but the underlying mech-<lb/>anism is still under debate. The MMN is thought to <lb/>reflect either the prediction-error signal resulting from <lb/>the comparison between the input and the top-down <lb/>prediction (prediction hypothesis), or the fresh stimu-<lb/>lus propagating through un-adapted synapses (adapta-<lb/>tion hypothesis). The omission paradigms that elicit the <lb/>OSR are often used in the debate to emphasize the need <lb/>for active prediction, since the adaptation mechanism <lb/>alone does not produce extra neural activities without <lb/>any input. However, according to the computational <lb/>models based on either hypothesis, the OSR is quali-<lb/>tatively different from the classical MMNs elicited by <lb/>other deviants. The adaptation-based model suggests <lb/>the OSR to be a rebound response (i.e. sustained reso-<lb/>nance) rather than a modulated N1 [52]. The prediction-<lb/>based model suggests the OSR to reflect predictive sig-<lb/>nals rather than prediction error [102]. Both interpre-<lb/>tations implicitly suggest pure endogenous activities <lb/>where a change detection mechanism is not involved, <lb/>which conflicts with the two properties of ORS men-<lb/>tioned above. The interpretation to MMN generation <lb/>therefore is not comprehensive yet. <lb/>The above issues underscore the need for a unifying <lb/>view to deviance detection covering the cortical On/Off <lb/>responses, the cortical OSR, and the MMN. Given the <lb/>non-specific wiring patterns across areas in the cortex, <lb/>we ask whether cortical deviance detection can be sup-<lb/>ported by neural circuits of a common structural mo-<lb/>tif. We propose a generic deviance detection principle <lb/>(Figure 1a), where change detection can take place lo-<lb/>cally under proper reciprocal connections (Figure 1b), <lb/>monitoring the neighboring neural activities that rep-<lb/>resent a regular feature. This principle is based on the <lb/>assumption that the process of deviance detection can <lb/>be functionally separated into stages of regularity for-<lb/>mation and change detection. <lb/>In the first part of the Results section, we provide <lb/>simulation examples that reproduce several properties <lb/>of cortical On/Off responses, cortical OSR, and MMN. <lb/>In examples I and II, we demonstrate that the various <lb/>types of cortical On/Off responses in terms of their tem-<lb/>poral profiles and frequency receptive fields (RFRs) can <lb/>be attributed to the connection patterns between input <lb/>and observation points. In example III, we demonstrate <lb/>that the OSR can be regarded as a change detection <lb/>response (or an Off response) to the cessation of con-<lb/>stant periodicity, In example IV, we demonstrate that <lb/>R-C pair for <lb/>deviance detection <lb/>a <lb/>b <lb/>f <lb/>f C <lb/>f <lb/>f <lb/>f <lb/>f R <lb/>f C <lb/>f <lb/>f <lb/>f <lb/>feature representation <lb/>Levels of <lb/>Node 2 <lb/>E <lb/>I <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>W <lb/>Input1 Input2 <lb/>E <lb/>I <lb/>Excitatory <lb/>Inhibitory <lb/>Input 1 <lb/>Input 2 <lb/>Node 1 <lb/>Fig. 1 Illustration of the role of deviance detection in hier-<lb/>archical feature representation. a The process of feature rep-<lb/>resentation includes the interaction between regularity for-<lb/>mation (R) and change detection (C). The R nodes repre-<lb/>sent temporally stable feature (regularity, f R ) by accumulat-<lb/>ing and extracting the ascending information from the lower-<lb/>level features. The C nodes detect abrupt temporal changes <lb/>in the neighboring R node(s) and pass them as new features <lb/>(f C , gray arrows) to the higher levels. In this sense, an R-<lb/>C pair forms a basic mechanism of deviance detection which <lb/>takes place at every level in the hierarchy. b An R-C pair is <lb/>formed by two reciprocally coupled nodes. In the simulations, <lb/>all nodes are allowed to receive external weighted inputs that <lb/>reach the excitatory and inhibitory populations. The inter-<lb/>node connections (green) are the free parameters, and the <lb/>intra-node connections are fixed for simplicity. <lb/>the sequence MMN can be regarded as change detec-<lb/>tion responses to the switch in sequence regularity (or <lb/>a mixture of an On response to the deviant and an Off <lb/>response to the cessation of regularities). In the sec-<lb/>ond part of the Results section, we study the underly-<lb/>ing mechanism of change detection by investigating the <lb/>generation of simulated On and Off responses. We then <lb/>study how altered connection patterns (e.g., reduced <lb/>external connections to inhibitory populations, effect <lb/>of NMDA-r antagonists, and synaptic adaptation) af-<lb/>fect the emergence of change detectors. In the Discus-<lb/>sion section, we derive conclusions with regard to the <lb/>above mentioned questions. Finally, we provide testable <lb/>predictions for future verification. <lb/>2 Methods <lb/>2.1 Model description <lb/>The simulations are done with rate-based models which <lb/>allow for a simple and scalable network motif while <lb/>keeping the network dynamics comparable to the exper-<lb/>imental observations such as LFP, MEG/EEG.

Neural populations interact with each other <lb/>by means of firing rate via connections defined in the <lb/>matrices W EE , W IE , W EI and W II which correspond <lb/>to excitatory to excitatory, excitatory to inhibitory, in-<lb/>hibitory to excitatory, and inhibitory to inhibitory con-<lb/>nections, respectively. Self-feedback is allowed. All E <lb/>populations in the network are fed with constant back-<lb/>ground input. External stimuli X(t) reach the E and I <lb/>populations via external connections specified by W EX <lb/>and W IX . <lb/>Neural populations The processing of neural activities <lb/>in a population is governed by two operators [34, 35, <lb/>88,89]. The rate-to-potential operator describes a linear <lb/>transformation from the mean firing rate to the mean <lb/>PSP. The input firing rate x c (t), c ∈ {e, i} reaches a <lb/>population via excitatory/inhibitory synapses and is <lb/>transformed to the EPSP/IPSP v c (t) in that popula-<lb/>tion. This transformation is described by the rate-to-<lb/>potential process which is achieved by convolving the <lb/>input firing rate x c (t) with a synaptic kernel h c (t). <lb/>v c (t) = x c (t) ⊗ h c (t) <lb/>(1) <lb/>The synaptic kernels h c (t) describe the synaptic spike <lb/>responses and are specified according to different char-<lb/>acteristics of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In <lb/>Equation 2, the average synaptic gain H c controls the <lb/>maximum of the synaptic spike response curve, and the <lb/>time constant τ c represents the delay due to dendritic <lb/>effects and neurotransmitter kinetics. Θ(t) denotes the <lb/>Heaviside step function, where Θ(0) = 1. <lb/>h c (t) = <lb/>H c <lb/>τ c <lb/>tΘ(t)e <lb/>−t <lb/>τc <lb/>(2) <lb/>The convolution in Equation 1 can be further repre-<lb/>sented by two first-order ordinary differential equations: <lb/>v c (t) = u c (t) <lb/>(3) <lb/>u c (t) = <lb/>H c <lb/>τ c <lb/>x(t) − <lb/>2 <lb/>τ c <lb/>u c (t) − <lb/>1 <lb/>τ 2 <lb/>c <lb/>v c (t) <lb/>(4) <lb/>Finally, the overall PSP v(t) in the neural popula-<lb/>tion is the summed effect of EPSP and IPSP. <lb/>v(t) = v e (t) − v i (t) <lb/>(5) <lb/>The potential-to-rate operator transforms v(t) into <lb/>output firing rate m(t) by a non-linear sigmoid function <lb/>S as described in Equation 6, where e 0 controls the <lb/>maximum firing rate and r controls the slope at the <lb/>membrane potential v 0 for firing. <lb/>m(t) = S (v(t)) = <lb/>2e 0 <lb/>1 + e r(v0−v(t)) <lb/>(6) <lb/>Nodes A node, consisting of one excitatory and one in-<lb/>hibitory neural population, represents the basic build-<lb/>ing block in a hierarchical feature representation (Fig-<lb/>ure 1). It represents more as a functional unit rather <lb/>than a structural one such as a &apos;cortical column&apos;. For N <lb/>nodes that represent N locations in the auditory cortex <lb/>and M external inputs that represent the intensity of a <lb/>certain feature such as M tones, the network structure <lb/>is defined by four N × N connection matrices W EE , <lb/>W IE , W EI and W II , and two N × M external connec-<lb/>tion matrices W EX and W IX . Each element w (non-<lb/>negative) in the connection matrices stands for the gain <lb/>factor between the outgoing and incoming firing rates <lb/>of the source and target population, respectively. It de-<lb/>pends on number and strengths of synapses established <lb/>between the two populations. The overall PSP of the <lb/>excitatory population in node j v E <lb/>j (t) is calculated in <lb/>Equation 7 as the joint effect of the EPSP v EE <lb/>j (t) and <lb/>the IPSP v EI <lb/>j (t). <lb/>v E <lb/>j (t) = v EE <lb/>j (t) − v EI <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(7) <lb/>The v EE <lb/>j (t) and v EI <lb/>j (t) are found by solving the dif-<lb/>ferential equations: <lb/>v EE <lb/>j (t) = u EE <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(8) <lb/>u EE <lb/>j (t) = <lb/>H e <lb/>τ e <lb/>N <lb/>k <lb/>a jk w EE <lb/>jk m E <lb/>k (t) + w EX <lb/>jq X q (t) + B <lb/>− <lb/>2 <lb/>τ e <lb/>u EE <lb/>j (t) − <lb/>1 <lb/>τ 2 <lb/>e <lb/>v EE <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(9) <lb/>v EI <lb/>j (t) = u EI <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(10) <lb/>u EI <lb/>j (t) = <lb/>H i <lb/>τ i <lb/>N <lb/>k <lb/>w EI <lb/>jk m I <lb/>k (t) − <lb/>2 <lb/>τ i <lb/>u EI <lb/>j (t) − <lb/>1 <lb/>τ 2 <lb/>i <lb/>v EI <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(11) <lb/></body>

			<body>In Equation 9 and 11, w EE <lb/>jk , w EI <lb/>jk and w EX <lb/>jq <lb/>are el-<lb/>ements in W EE , W EI and W EX . The element w EI <lb/>jk <lb/>stands for the connection strength from the inhibitory <lb/>population in node k to the excitatory population in <lb/>node j. m E <lb/>k (t) and m I <lb/>k (t) are the outgoing firing rates <lb/>of the excitatory and inhibitory population in node k. <lb/>X q (t) is external input q, and B is a constant back-<lb/>ground input. The synaptic adaptation term a jk modu-<lb/>lates the connections strength w EE <lb/>jk . Similarly, the over-<lb/>all PSP of the inhibitory population in node j v I <lb/>j (t) is <lb/>calculated in Equation 12 as the joint effect of the EPSP <lb/>v IE <lb/>j (t) and the IPSP v II <lb/>j (t). <lb/>v I <lb/>j (t) = v IE <lb/>j (t) − v II <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(12) <lb/>The v IE <lb/>j (t) and v II <lb/>j (t) are found by solving the dif-<lb/>ferential equations: <lb/>v IE <lb/>j (t) = u IE <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(13) <lb/>u IE <lb/>j (t) = <lb/>H e <lb/>τ e <lb/>N <lb/>k <lb/>w IE <lb/>jk m E <lb/>k (t) + w IX <lb/>jq X q (t) <lb/>− <lb/>2 <lb/>τ e <lb/>u IE <lb/>j (t) − <lb/>1 <lb/>τ 2 <lb/>e <lb/>v IE <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(14) <lb/>v II <lb/>j (t) = u II <lb/>j (t) <lb/>(15) <lb/>u II <lb/>j (t) = <lb/>H i <lb/>τ i <lb/>N <lb/>k <lb/>w II <lb/>jk m I <lb/>k (t) − <lb/>2 <lb/>τ i <lb/>u II <lb/>j (t)− <lb/>1 <lb/>τ 2 <lb/>i <lb/>v II <lb/>j (t) (16) <lb/>The value of constant background input B is chosen <lb/>so that the nodes work in proper conditions (i.e., near <lb/>bifurcation point for an isolated node). The external <lb/>input X q (t) reaches both the excitatory and inhibitory <lb/>populations in node j with connection strengths w EX <lb/>jq <lb/>and w IX <lb/>jq , where the ratio w IX <lb/>jq /w EX <lb/>jq <lb/>is set to 0.5 by <lb/>default. The synaptic adaptation term a represents the <lb/>efficacy of excitatory to excitatory connections W EE . <lb/>The synaptic efficacy (in range [0,1]) varies according <lb/>to Equation 17 when synaptic adaptation is considered, <lb/>otherwise a is fixed to 1. <lb/>Synaptic adaptation When synaptic adaptation on W EE <lb/>is considered, the connection strength w EE <lb/>jk is modu-<lb/>lated by the term a jk in Equation 9 that varies accord-<lb/>ing to the pre-synaptic activity m E <lb/>k (t). <lb/>a jk (t) = <lb/>1 − a jk (t) <lb/>τ a <lb/>− κa jk (t)m E <lb/>k (t) <lb/>(17) <lb/>The adaptation time constant τ a represents the re-<lb/>covery rate of the synaptic efficacy, and the constant κ <lb/>influences the falling speed and the minimum value of <lb/>a jk (t) according to m E <lb/>k (t). <lb/>Short-term plasticity The short-term plasticity is not <lb/>a focus in this study and is used only in simulation <lb/>example III as a possible solution for the regularity for-<lb/>mation in input periodicity. The plasticity adjusts the <lb/>bindings among the nodes with different resonance so <lb/>that the group response maintains a stable representa-<lb/>tion of input periodicity. The plasticity is applied on <lb/>w EE <lb/>jk and w EI <lb/>jk , where nodes j and k are used to encode <lb/>periodicity. The connection w EE <lb/>jk increases if σ EE <lb/>jk (t, d), <lb/>the covariance between m E <lb/>j (t) and m E <lb/>k (t) during time <lb/>t − d to t, is positive and decreases gradually back to <lb/>zero otherwise (Equations 18,19). Similarly, the connec-<lb/>tion w EI <lb/>jk increases if σ EI <lb/>jk (t, d) is negative and decreases <lb/>gradually back to zero otherwise (Equations 20,21). In <lb/>Equations 19 and 21, η is the learning rate. The weights <lb/>α jk and β jk are calculated from two Gaussian func-<lb/>tions based on the distance between nodes j and k <lb/>(The nodes with similar resonance frequencies are closer <lb/>to each other). This short-term plasticity learning rule <lb/>is rather function-driven than based on biological evi-<lb/>dence. More studies need to be done for a more realistic <lb/>network model that maintains the input periodicity. <lb/>C EE <lb/>jk (t) = max σ EE <lb/>jk (t, d), 0 <lb/>(18) <lb/>w EE <lb/>jk (t) = −w EE <lb/>jk (t) + ηα jk C EE <lb/>jk (t) <lb/>(19) <lb/>C EI <lb/>jk (t) = |min σ EI <lb/>jk (t, d), 0 | <lb/>(20) <lb/>w EI <lb/>jk (t) = −w EI <lb/>jk (t) + ηβ jk C EI <lb/>jk (t) <lb/>(21) <lb/>Simulated MEG signals To synthesize a gross signal <lb/>from the activities of all neural populations in the net-<lb/>work, both the excitatory current (or active sink) and <lb/>inhibitory current (or active source) at the excitatory <lb/>populations (i.e. Pyramidal cells) are taken into account <lb/>[87]. This is a more generalized approach than just con-<lb/>sidering the sum of the excitatory inputs weighted by <lb/>excitatory to excitatory connection strength and the <lb/>adaptation term [54].

The values of intra-node connections <lb/>are chosen such that a single node stays inactivated un-<lb/>der weak excitatory input and starts to oscillate as the <lb/>excitatory input strength increases to e 0 (i.e., half of the <lb/>maximum value of the sigmoid function). The adapta-<lb/>tion parameters τ a and κ are chosen such that a single <lb/>node remains oscillating during prolonged stimulation, <lb/>rather than showing only a transient peak response at <lb/>the onset. The general configurations are listed in Table <lb/>1. <lb/>2.3 Categorization of network behavior <lb/>In a two-node network where a prolonged stimulus (2000 <lb/>ms) is fed to node 1 (Figure 2a), the behavior of node <lb/>2 (i.e., the time course m E <lb/>2 (t)) is categorized into one <lb/>of the eight types based on the level changes and the <lb/>peak at edges: (1) sustained-Pure, (2) sustained-On, <lb/>(3) sustained-Off, (4) sustained-On&amp;Off, (5) inhibited-<lb/>Pure, (6) inhibited-On, (7) inhibited-Off, and (8) inhibited-<lb/>On&amp;Off. The &apos;sustained&apos; and &apos;inhibited&apos; stand for in-<lb/>creased and decreased activity during the stimulus. The <lb/>&apos;On&apos;, &apos;Off&apos; and &apos;On&amp;Off&apos; stand for transient peak(s) at <lb/>only the onset, only the offset and both the onset&amp;offset <lb/>of the stimulus. The &apos;Pure&apos; stands for no clear peaks at <lb/>the edges of the stimulus. Bistable behaviors are not in-<lb/>cluded in the categorization. (See Figure 2b and Table <lb/>2 for details of categorization.) <lb/>3 Results <lb/>The generic deviance detection principle suggests that <lb/>deviance detections take place locally in the percep-<lb/>tual hierarchy as illustrated in Figure 1. Any two re-<lb/>ciprocally coupled nodes in a network can potentially <lb/>form an R-C pair that serves deviance detection. The <lb/>connections within an R-C pair can be heterogeneous <lb/>across locations, thus giving rise to various behaviors of <lb/>change detectors. Below, we reproduce some observed <lb/>phenomena of deviance-related responses using simple <lb/>networks (e.g., comprising two, three, and twenty one <lb/>nodes) in simulation examples (Section 3.1), and then <lb/>we investigate the behavior of change detectors and the <lb/>corresponding network settings in Section 3.2. <lb/>3.1 Simulation examples <lb/>Example I: temporal profiles of cortical On/Off responses <lb/>A sustained tone stimulus can elicit diverse temporal <lb/>patterns of On/Off responses in the auditory cortex. <lb/>Neurons can be sensitive to the onset/offset of the stim-<lb/>ulus (i.e., transient responses at the edges), and mean-<lb/>while also show increased or decreased firing rate dur-<lb/>ing the stimulus (i.e., level changes) compared with the <lb/>spontaneous activity [16, 69, 39, 20, 72, 100]. In this simu-<lb/>lation, we feed the input stimulus (2000 ms duration) to <lb/>a two-node network (Figure 2a), where the change de-<lb/>tector does not directly receive the input stimulus (i.e., <lb/>the external connections to node 2, w EX <lb/>2 <lb/>= w IX <lb/>2 <lb/>= 0). <lb/>Varying the inter-node connections W alters the re-<lb/>sponse of the change detector (e.g., the firing rate of its <lb/>excitatory population m E <lb/>2 (t)). We scan through a range <lb/>of inter-node connections (W EE , W IE ∈ {0, 0.1, ..., 0.5}; <lb/>W EI , W II ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.2}), and categorize the time courses <lb/>of m E <lb/>2 (t) into one of the eight types based on the level <lb/>changes and the peak at edges (Figure 2b). The W so-<lb/>lutions are connection settings that give rise to one of <lb/>the eight categorized On/Off types under this specific <lb/>simulation settings (e.g., the intensity and onset/offset <lb/>time of stimulus, the intensity of background input, and <lb/>intra-node connections, etc). <lb/>To further investigate the relation between the inter-<lb/>node connections W and the On/Off responses, we project <lb/>the W solutions {W type i , i = 1, 2, ..., 8} to a 2D plane <lb/>by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding [51] <lb/>to visualize the mutual proximity of W solutions in <lb/>the original eight-dimensional space. From Figure 2d <lb/>we observe that: (1) Although the W solutions show <lb/>clustered pattern from a broader scale, different types <lb/>are found to be mixed in space when zooming in. The <lb/>clustering patterns and its sensitivity to W may poten-<lb/>tially explain the diverse but spatially clustered On/Off <lb/></body>

(4) However, there <lb/>are also areas where the On, Off and On&amp;Off types are <lb/>close to each other, which supposedly are more sensi-<lb/>tive to neuroplasticity (e.g. synaptic adaptation, spike-<lb/>timing-dependent plasticity, or homeostatic plasticity) <lb/>that change neural response from one type to another. <lb/>Example II: distinct onset and offset frequency recep-<lb/>tive fields (FRFs) As demonstrated in Example I, the <lb/>two-node network can account for the different tempo-<lb/>ral profiles of On/Off responses.

In addition, this cell shows sup-<lb/>pressed spike density (deep blue) during stimuli at low <lb/>and middle frequencies.

The ratios (orange and <lb/>green) reflect how far the two nodes are from the stim-<lb/>ulus source. Considering the tonotopic organization in <lb/>the auditory cortex, the ratios are also changed for each <lb/>simulation trial because the stimulus input in each sim-<lb/>ulation trial represents a different tonal frequency. The <lb/>inter-node connections W is picked up from the W so-<lb/>lutions and is fixed in each example, and the ratios are <lb/>adjusted such that the responses of node 2 (i.e., the time <lb/>courses of m E <lb/>2 (t) mimic qualitatively the experimental <lb/>observations. The simulation trials are then merged to <lb/>make simulated FRFs (Figure 3e-g). <lb/>In Figure 3e, the excitatory population E 2 shows <lb/>inhibited-Off response when ratio1 = 1 and ratio2 = 0 <lb/>(same as the ideal case used in Example I). The On re-<lb/>sponse emerges as ratio1 decreases, and a small amount <lb/>of ratio2 results in stronger On responses and weaker <lb/>Off responses. In Figure 3f, E 2 shows inhibited-Off re-<lb/>sponse when ratio1 = 1 and ratio2 = 0, and it turns <lb/>into sustained-Pure type when ratio2 is larger than <lb/>ratio1. In Figure 3g, E 2 shows inhibited-On&amp;Off re-<lb/>sponse, and a small amount of ratio2 results in stronger <lb/>On responses. <lb/>The two-node network, although rate-based, may <lb/>provide a sense how the exemplary cells in Figure 3a-c <lb/>are influenced by different sound tones: ratio2 (green) <lb/>indicates which tones are closer to (or more directly <lb/>influencing) the cell, and ratio1 (orange) reflects how <lb/>its surrounding neurons are sensitive to the tonal scope. <lb/>Example III: omitted-stimulus response (OSR) The OSR <lb/>resembles the Off response as they both peak at the off-<lb/>set of a prolonged stimulus or a train of periodic stim-<lb/>uli. However, the OSR differentiates itself from the Off <lb/>response by its property of temporal expectation. The <lb/>peak latencies of OSR are not constant but proportional <lb/>to the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the repeti-<lb/>tive stimuli as illustrated in Figure 4a. The OSR at cor-<lb/>tical level (aka. omission response or omission MMN) <lb/>resembles the classic MMN, as both responses are re-<lb/>lated to violations to certain expectations (e.g. expec-<lb/>tation to the &apos;when&apos; or the &apos;what&apos; in the stimuli). <lb/>The generic deviance detection principle suggests <lb/>that the cortical OSR is a change detection response <lb/>(or an Off response) to the end of stable periodicity rep-<lb/>resentation. In our simulation, the periodicity is repre-<lb/>sented by a bank of oscillators [52, 48] comprising multi-<lb/>ple nodes (i.e. R nodes) with different resonant frequen-<lb/>cies (implemented by different time constants τ e and τ i <lb/>for simplicity). In this way, the temporal feature of peri-<lb/>odicity is transformed into a spatial pattern represented <lb/>by the R nodes. Unlike the conventional bank of oscil-<lb/>lators where the oscillators are not connected to each <lb/>other, the R nodes are inter-connected with short-term <lb/>plasticity on W EE and W EI (Note: short-term plas-<lb/>ticity on W EE and W IE also works in this example). <lb/>The plasticity enhances the connections between two <lb/>nodes if they oscillate in high covariance, and reduces <lb/></body>

			<body>expected evoked potential before the OSR (e.g., Figure <lb/>7B in [12]). In Figure 4d, we show that the n-node net-<lb/>work (n = 21 in this example) is able to respond at the <lb/>right timing (i.e. a constant delay after the detectable <lb/>omission) with the limitation that the SOA is within <lb/>150 ms. The peak latencies become unstable for SOAs <lb/>larger than 200 ms. The limitation is due to the limit of <lb/>resonant frequencies in the bank of oscillators, as can <lb/>be seen in Figure 4c the simulated MEG for SOA 250 <lb/>is not as stable compared to faster SOAs. <lb/>In this example, we demonstrate that the cortical <lb/>OSR can reflect a detection mechanism upon the stable <lb/>representation of periodicity. The sustained resonance <lb/>is crucial for temporal expectation. This is in line with <lb/>the observation that the auditory brainstem does not <lb/>generate overt OSR [50] because sustained resonance <lb/>has not happened at that stage. We have not yet fully <lb/>investigated the neural mechanism underlying tempo-<lb/>ral expectancy. The auditory cortex is assumed to have <lb/>the capacity to represent a certain range of periodicity <lb/>locally (e.g. under 200 ms), and the bank of oscillators, <lb/>which only assumes heterogeneity across neural popu-<lb/>lations, is so far a good candidate for implementation. <lb/>Example IV: sequence mismatch negativity (MMN) The <lb/>responses in a roving paradigm reveal the progress of <lb/>regularity formation and change detection, and thus <lb/>is a good example for demonstrating the generic de-<lb/>viance detection principle. In Figure 5a, an MEG study <lb/>shows how the human brain responds to the switch be-<lb/>tween regular and random complex acoustic patterns <lb/>[5]. There are On and Off responses at the onsets and <lb/>offsets of the stimulus sequence. An MMN response is <lb/>elicited by the transition from regular to random se-<lb/>quences (REG-RAND), but there is only gradually ris-<lb/>ing root mean square (RMS) amplitude for the other <lb/>way around (RAND-REG). Also, the RMS amplitude <lb/>is higher during regular sequences compared to random <lb/>sequences. <lb/>In the simulation, we use a three-node network to <lb/>reproduce the temporal profile of the RMS in Figure 5a. <lb/>Two stimulus inputs (REG and RAND) that represent <lb/>the random and regular features are fed to the nodes <lb/>1 and 2 respectively as in Figure 5b. The intensity and <lb/>rise/fall time of the two stimulus inputs are the same as <lb/>in the previous examples, and the durations are set to <lb/>match the experiment. The inter-node connections W <lb/>between nodes 1,2 and node 3 are chosen from the W <lb/>solutions in Figure 2d. The connections between nodes <lb/>1 and 2 do not have to be symmetric and are manu-<lb/>ally tuned to match the observed RMS.

The peak latencies in each simulation <lb/>trial (blue dots) under the same SOA can be different, which <lb/>depends on the network stability during stimulus and the off-<lb/>set time. Black dots are the mean peak latencies.

			<body>ral populations under regular and random sequences <lb/>can be dramatically different, which then explains the <lb/>level changes in RMS amplitude. In this simulation ex-<lb/>ample we use identical stimulus inputs, in an attempt <lb/>to highlight the effect of inter-node connections W on <lb/>shaping the network activities. Note that this simula-<lb/>tion example elucidates on the contribution of a change <lb/>detector, rather than the details of regularity formation. <lb/>To understand how REG sequence causes higher RMS <lb/>amplitude, we assume short-term plasticity on W EE <lb/>and W IE in the lower-level neural populations at the <lb/>stage of regularity formation. This follows the sugges-<lb/>tion by a dynamic causal modeling study [3] that synap-<lb/>tic gain modulation in the auditory cortex is involved <lb/>in processing regular sequences. <lb/>3.2 The requirements for a change detector <lb/>The generic deviance detection principle emphasizes on <lb/>the ubiquity of local change detection and its sepa-<lb/>ration from regularity formation. In previous simula-<lb/>tion examples, we demonstrate that the behavior of <lb/>a change detector can account for many phenomena <lb/>(e.g., diverse cortical On/Off responses, distinct onset-<lb/>and offset-FRFs, cortical OSR, and sequence MMN). <lb/>Here, we present a more detailed analysis of the exact <lb/>requirements for a change detector to work. First, we <lb/>investigate how and under which conditions the On and <lb/>Off responses occur. Then we examine how changes in <lb/>connection strengths affects the generation of On/Off <lb/>responses through three factors: (1) external input to <lb/>inhibitory populations, (2) blockage of NMDA receptor <lb/>channels, and (3) synaptic adaptation. <lb/>The generation of On responses It has been proposed <lb/>that On responses can be due to adaptive and post-<lb/>onset inhibitory mechanisms that reshape the onset re-<lb/>sponse in auditory nerve fibers [66]. In our simulations, <lb/>we found that the On responses can be also due to the <lb/>transiently inhibited activity of the inhibitory popula-<lb/>tion I 2 at the onset of stimulus. As can be seen in Figure <lb/>6b and d, population I 2 is shortly inhibited by popula-<lb/>tion I 1 , and the low v I <lb/>2 (t) leads to a transient peak in <lb/>v E <lb/>2 (t) (indicated by the red and black arrows in the ma-<lb/>genta rectangles). The system returns to stability soon <lb/>after the v E <lb/>2 (t) peak brings v I <lb/>2 (t) up again.

The inter-node con-<lb/>nections W is chosen from the W solutions that give rise to <lb/>inhibited-On&amp;Off responses in the C node (node 2) (see Fig-<lb/>ure 2b). b Node responses to the stimulus (gray period) are <lb/>shown in firing rates (upper plot) and in PSPs (lower plot). As <lb/>an inhibited-On&amp;Off response, the time course m E <lb/>2 (t) (black <lb/>curve) shows lower amplitude during stimulus and transient <lb/>peaks at the onset and offset of stimulus. To understand the <lb/>generation of On response in population E 2 , the magenta <lb/>rectangle indicate the period of transient disinhibition where <lb/>population I 2 is transiently inhibited by population I 1 (red <lb/>arrow), and population E 2 peaks right after the transient <lb/>disinhibition (black arrow). c and d show a similar example <lb/>for sustained-On&amp;Off response, where the generation of On <lb/>response is also due to the transient disinhibition. <lb/>rebound that is related to the intrinsic conductance <lb/>property of the neuron membranes [44]. However, the <lb/>generation of the Off responses that follow sustained ac-<lb/>tivity (i.e. the sustained-Off responses) cannot be sim-<lb/>ply explained by the post-inhibition mechanism (see re-<lb/>view in [106,43]). Here we examine under which con-<lb/>ditions the inhibited-Off and sustained-Off responses <lb/>might arise at the network level. <lb/>In Figure 7, the population E 2 shows Off responses <lb/>for both cases: the inhibited and sustained activity dur-<lb/>ing stimulus. In the simulations, both inhibited-Off and <lb/>sustained-Off responses result from the same mecha-<lb/>nism. As shown in Figure 7b and e, the Off response <lb/>comes in two steps. First, the population I 2 receives <lb/>strong inhibition from population I 1 during stimulus <lb/>(reflected by the negative PSP v I <lb/>2 (t) during t=3000 to <lb/>5000 ms). Second, the population E 2 activity peaks be-<lb/>fore I 2 recovers after stimulus offset (the transient peak <lb/>v E <lb/>2 (t) during t=5000 to 5100 ms). The occurrence of Off <lb/>responses can be also represented by phase portraits <lb/>shown in Figure 7c and f. The trajectories of the phase <lb/>portraits show how v E <lb/>2 (t) and v I <lb/>2 (t) evolve interactively. <lb/>When there is only background input, E 2 and I 2 oscil-<lb/>late in the normal steady state (the counter-clockwise <lb/>blue trajectories) where E 2 excites I 2 , and I 2 inhibits <lb/>E 2 . During stimulus presentation, E 2 and I 2 oscillate <lb/>in a reversed steady state (the clockwise green trajec-<lb/>tories) where E 2 has an additional inhibitory effect on <lb/>I 2 through the pathway E 2 → I 1 → I 2 , and I 2 has an <lb/>additional disinhibitory effect on E 2 through the path-<lb/>way I 2 → I 1 → E 2 , due to the involvement of active <lb/>I 1 during stimulus. The Off responses are depicted by <lb/>the magenta trajectories during the transition from the <lb/>reversed steady state to the normal steady state. <lb/>The simulations provide clues for the underlying <lb/>neural mechanism. The inter-node connection W II is <lb/>critical for a network to give rise to the Off responses <lb/>because some inhibitory population I 2 has to be in-<lb/>hibited (i.e. disinhibition) first. The inter-node connec-<lb/>tion W EI is important to maintain the network in the <lb/>working state (e.g., the reversed steady state) other-<lb/>wise the network gets &apos;overheated&apos; during disinhibition. <lb/>With these structural prerequisites, the excitatory pop-<lb/>ulation E 2 may show a transient Off response before <lb/>the inhibitory population I 2 catches up again after the <lb/>stimulus offset. <lb/>The timing of the stimulus offset (i.e. the initial <lb/>point in the state space when the transition begins) <lb/>and other parameters that alter the trajectories of the <lb/>two steady states (such as the stimulus intensity, and <lb/>the settings of W EE and W IE ) also affect the genera-<lb/>tion of Off response, but these factors are not critical. <lb/>Moreover, the inhibited activity during stimulus is not <lb/>critical for the generation of the Off response at net-<lb/>work level (cf., it is necessary in the post-inhibitory <lb/>mechanism at cellular level). As can be seen in Figure <lb/>7f, the amplitude of v E <lb/>2 (t) during stimulus (green tra-<lb/>jectory) can be larger compared to no stimulus (blue <lb/>trajectory). <lb/>Factors influencing the On/Off responses We consider <lb/>the effect of three factors with respect to the gener-<lb/>ation of On/Off responses: (1) external input to in-<lb/>hibitory populations, (2) blockage of NMDA receptor <lb/>channels, and (3) synaptic adaptation. More specifi-<lb/>cally, we checked how these three factors influence the <lb/>distribution of W solutions in the two-node network. <lb/>Since disinhibition plays an important role in the <lb/>generation of both On and Off responses as illustrated <lb/>in the above simulations (Figure 6 and 7), it is inter-<lb/>esting to see the contribution of external input to the <lb/>inhibitory population I 1 . In condition II, the external <lb/>connection W IX is set to zero in comparison with the <lb/>default setting W IX = 0.5W EX (condition I). <lb/>The NMDA-r antagonist MK-801 is found to reduce <lb/>inhibition during stimulation and thus reduce the Off <lb/>responses [4]. NMDA-r antagonists are also known to <lb/>reduce the amplitude of the MMN [55]. In condition III, <lb/>we mimic the effect of NMDA-r antagonists by reduc-<lb/></body>

The difference in reduction applied to <lb/>the two connections is based on the fact that excita-<lb/>tory synapses on inhibitory neurons are mainly covered <lb/>by NMDA channels and therefore are more sensitive to <lb/>NMDA-r antagonists than the excitatory synapses on <lb/>excitatory neurons [74]. The setting of external connec-<lb/>tions remains the same as the default setting. redNote <lb/>that, in principle, both conditions II and III might be <lb/>sensitive to NMDA-r antagonists. So, if NMDA-r an-<lb/>tagonists are indeed the cause of reduced connection <lb/>strengths to inhibitory populations, the effect in con-<lb/>dition II and III in Figure 8h should occur simulta-<lb/>neously. Other effects by NMDA-r antagonists such as <lb/>the changes in NMDA currents, synaptic plasticity and <lb/>synaptic time constant are not included. <lb/>The phenomenon of synaptic adaptation is ubiqui-<lb/>tous and has been suggested to be one of the mecha-<lb/>nisms underlying deviance detection. Since we suggest <lb/>that deviance-related responses can be interpreted as <lb/>the change detection responses to regularity represen-<lb/>tation, it is good to know whether synaptic adaptation <lb/>promotes the emergence of change detectors. To con-<lb/>sider synaptic adaptation in the simulation, the intra-<lb/>and inter-node connections W EE are modulated by a <lb/>synaptic efficacy term a as described in Equation 17. <lb/>Note that as described in Equation 9, the external input <lb/>via W EX to the excitatory populations is not affected <lb/>by synaptic adaptation. <lb/>The responses of two-node network with a range of <lb/>inter-node connections W s (same as in Example I in <lb/>Section 3.1) are simulated, and each W is assigned to <lb/>one of the nine types of responses (i.e., eight On/Off <lb/>types and type 9: others. See also Figure 2b) under <lb/>four conditions: (I) the default condition, where synap-<lb/>tic adaptation is not applied, and W IX = 0.5W EX , <lb/>(II) W IX = 0, (III) W EE = 0 is reduced by 25% and <lb/>W IE = 0 is reduced by 50%, and (IV) synaptic adapta-<lb/>tion is applied. To visualize the result, the W solutions <lb/>of types 1 to 9 are projected to 2D plane (Figure 8a-d). <lb/>The number of W solutions under the four condition <lb/>are summarized in the contingency table (Figure 8e-g) <lb/>and the bar chart (Figure 8h). <lb/>The bar chart (Figure 8h) shows that the number <lb/>of W solutions of Off types in condition II are reduced <lb/>compared to condition I. Most of the Off types under <lb/>condition I turn to Pure types under condition II (e.g., <lb/>sustained-Off → sustained-Pure among 1.25% of the <lb/>scanned W s. See the cyan rectangle in Figure 8e). This <lb/>suggests that the external connection W IX is support-<lb/>ive for the generation of Off responses, because the I 1 -<lb/>to-I 2 disinhibition is enhanced due to the external input <lb/>via W IX . <lb/></body>

			<body>In condition III the number of W solutions of Off <lb/>types are reduced, but the number of W solutions of <lb/>On types are slightly increased compared to condition I <lb/>(Figure 8h). This is in line with the experimental result <lb/>that NMDA-r antagonist reduce the Off responses but <lb/>the On responses are not affected [37, 99]. <lb/>In condition IV, the number of W solutions of both <lb/>On and Off types are greatly increased (Figure 8h). <lb/>Many of the Pure types under condition I turn into On <lb/>and Off types under condition III (e.g., 3.28%: sustained-<lb/>Pure → sustained-On; 1.62%: inhibited-Pure → sustained-<lb/>Off; 2.82%: inhibited-Pure → inhibited-Off. See the ma-<lb/>genta rectangle in Figure 8f). This suggests that synap-<lb/>tic adaptation greatly promotes the emergence of change <lb/>detectors. To see how synaptic adaptation alters the <lb/>network responses, Figure 9a-c show three examples of <lb/>altered responses due to synaptic adaptation. The three <lb/>examples show typical type transitions from condition <lb/>I to condition IV. <lb/>4 Discussion <lb/>We propose a generic deviance detection principle based <lb/>on the fact that many deviance-related responses can <lb/>be observed in the cortex without clear evidence of <lb/>functionally-specific wiring patterns. The mechanism <lb/>suggests that the reciprocal wirings in the cortex give <lb/>rise to the emergence of change detectors that respond <lb/>to the abrupt change in regular features. With this no-<lb/>tion, the deviance-related responses observed in the cor-<lb/>tex such as the cortical On/Off responses, the cortical <lb/>OSR and the MMN are regarded as responses of change <lb/>detectors at different levels of abstraction. <lb/>The simulation examples demonstrate the network <lb/>responses can resemble the properties of cortical On/Off <lb/>responses (Figure 2 and 3), the cortical OSR (Figure <lb/>4), and the MMN (Figure 5). We then study the wiring <lb/>patterns in the network that support the generation of <lb/>On/Off responses (Figure 6 and 7). The results suggest <lb/>that the inhibitory to inhibitory connections are impor-<lb/>tant for both On and Off responses, which implies that <lb/>these deviance-related responses are closely related to <lb/>disinhibition. In the simulations that mimic the effect of <lb/>NMDA-r antagonists and synaptic adaptation, the re-<lb/>sults show that NMDA-r antagonists suppress the Off <lb/>responses and slightly promote the On responses, and <lb/>synaptic adaptation generally boosts both On and Off <lb/>responses (Figure 8 and 9). Below we provide our view-<lb/>points regarding the questions raised in the introduc-<lb/>tion. Some testable predictions by our model are listed <lb/>at the end of the discussion. <lb/>Different processes in regularity formation, but <lb/>same mechanism in change detection. The generic <lb/>deviance detection principle suggests that the change <lb/>detection may rely on a common neural mechanism (i.e. <lb/>the local reciprocal wiring), while the regularity forma-<lb/>tion may, depending on the level of abstraction, require <lb/>different brain resources and time to collect relevant in-<lb/>formation. <lb/>There are a number of dissimilarities among differ-<lb/>ent deviance-related responses, which are, as we will <lb/>discuss hereunder, mainly due to differences in the pro-<lb/>cess of regularity formation. We take the differences be-<lb/>tween cortical OSR and MMN as an example. In terms <lb/>of temporal window of integration (TWI), a pitch MMN <lb/>can be elicited by traditional oddball paradigms even <lb/>when the SOA is larger than 500 ms [77, 6], while the es-<lb/>timated length of TWI for cortical OSR is much shorter <lb/>(160-170 ms) [107]. In terms of attention, it is sug-<lb/>gested that fast and slow periodic sequences elicit cor-<lb/>tical OSRs by two different mechanisms: The fast OSR <lb/>(periodicity &gt; 5 Hz) is elicited automatically, while the <lb/>slow OSR (periodicity &lt; 2 Hz) requires the involve-<lb/>ment of attention [41]. For example, the slow OSR can <lb/>be elicited at large SOAs such as 800 ms in [25]; and <lb/>1000 to 2000 ms in [15]. The need for attention suggests <lb/>that cortical OSR and MMN are different processes [60]. <lb/>In terms of required repetition, a successful elicitation <lb/>of MMN needs only two or three repetitions for sim-<lb/>ple feature-repetition regularities [8, 18, 91, 105], while <lb/>the cortical OSR requires up to 9 repetitions in a train <lb/>for a successful elicitation [29]. The above observations <lb/>suggest for different processes that are related to the <lb/>degree of difficulty in regularity formation. <lb/>There are several similarities among the deviance-<lb/>related responses that support the notion of a common <lb/>mechanism for change detection. In terms of latency, <lb/>the peak latencies of cortical On/Off responses, corti-<lb/>cal OSR, and MMN all fall in the range of 100-200 ms <lb/>[2, 57, 73, 107, 70]. In terms of spatial distribution, the <lb/>sources of cortical Off response and MMN are similar. <lb/>As revealed in animal studies, the sources of Off re-<lb/>sponses appear to be in the non-tonotopic area that is <lb/>adjacent to the tonotopic area [92, 4]. In studies of dense <lb/>mapping of MMN, the pitch MMN was reported to be <lb/>generated in the secondary auditory area (or spreading <lb/>more widely over the core and belt areas), which is sepa-<lb/>rate from the sources of P1 and N1 at the core areas (A1 <lb/>and AAF) [86, 67]. The cortical responses to the onset, <lb/>offset, and pitch change in a continuous stimulus share <lb/>similar topography and temporal profile, as suggested <lb/>in the EEG/MEG studies [110, 111, 62]. These obser-<lb/>vations support the notion of a common neural sub-<lb/></body>

In example simulation II, we further demonstrate <lb/>that for a specific connection setting, the difference in <lb/>input ratios to nodes gives rise to distinct onset and <lb/>offset FRFs (Figure 3). The W solutions of On/Off re-<lb/>sponses projected to the 2D plane (Figure 2c) also pro-<lb/>vide explanation to the diverse (and spatially clustered) <lb/>cell responses observed in auditory cortex in awake mice, <lb/>as shown in Figure 5 in [20]. These results suggest that <lb/>change detection is a basic and ubiquitous operation in <lb/>the cortex. <lb/>We then study the generation of On and Off re-<lb/>sponses. The On responses can be due to a transient <lb/>disinhibition (i.e., a quick and light inhibition on the in-<lb/>hibitory population of the change detector) before the <lb/>network reaches the steady state (Figure 6). The Off <lb/>responses are always due to a release from long-lasting <lb/>disinhibition (i.e., a long and strong inhibition on the <lb/>inhibitory population of the change detector) before the <lb/>network comes back to the steady state without stimu-<lb/>lus (Figure 7), in line with the rebound after inhibition <lb/>hypothesis [92, 27]. We suggest that the inhibitory to <lb/>inhibitory connections are a key ingredient for change <lb/>detection. <lb/>NMDA-r antagonists dampen the deviance-related <lb/>responses. We suggest that the NMDA-r antagonists <lb/>could generally dampen the deviance-related responses <lb/>through three aspects: (1) voltage-dependency, (2) synap-<lb/>tic plasticity and (3) E/I balance. First, the NMDA-r <lb/>antagonists block the voltage-dependent NMDA chan-<lb/>nels and reduce the additional NMDA currents that <lb/>reflect mismatch signals [37]. Second, the NMDA-r an-<lb/>tagonists damage the spike-timing-dependent plastic-<lb/>ity (STDP) and hamper the ability of regularity for-<lb/>mation [4, 38, 98]. Third, the NMDA-r antagonists al-<lb/>ter the connection patterns and E/I balance. Blocking <lb/>NMDA receptors leads to decreased activities in the <lb/>GABAergic interneurons and increased pyramidal ex-<lb/>citation, because the GABAergic interneurons are ten-<lb/>fold more sensitive to the NMDA-r antagonists than the <lb/>pyramidal neurons [74, 23]. <lb/>The adaptation-based and prediction-based mod-<lb/>els of MMN agree on the voltage-dependency aspect <lb/>and suggest that the reduced MMN amplitude is due <lb/>to the reduction in NMDA currents [53, 102, 101]. The <lb/>prediction-based models also mention the need for STDP <lb/>to form prediction signals [102, 101]. In addition to these <lb/>two aspects, our simulation results show that the al-<lb/>tered E/I balance as an effect of NMDA-r antagonists <lb/>can reduce the emergence of change detectors. In con-<lb/>dition III (Figure 8c), we reduce the strengths of W EE <lb/>and W IE by 25% and 50% respectively and count again <lb/>the number of each On/Off types in the scanned range <lb/>of inter-node connection W s. The number of Off types <lb/>is decreased and the number of On types is slightly <lb/>increased relative to the default setting (Figure 8h). <lb/>The results suggest that the NMDA-r antagonists may <lb/>dampen the cortical Off response, cortical OSR and <lb/>MMN. <lb/>We cannot draw further quantitative conclusion on <lb/>the effect of NMDA-r antagonists because the uniform <lb/>search range of W s in the simulation is just a simplifi-<lb/>cation, and the exact proportion of strength reduction <lb/>due to NMDA-r antagonists is not available. The set-<lb/>ting of 25% and 50% in connection strength reduction <lb/>in condition III was arbitrary so that a single node still <lb/>oscillates under a certain range of input intensity, which <lb/>eliminates the case when the nodes get saturated and <lb/>no On/Off responses are not generated at all. The time <lb/>constant τ e due to the blockage of NMDA channels was <lb/>not modified in the simulation in order to focus on the <lb/>effect of W change. <lb/>Synaptic adaptation facilitates change detection. <lb/>Synaptic adaptation is a pervasive short-term synaptic <lb/>plasticity that is considered as a mechanism underlying <lb/>deviance detection, in the sense that a rare stimulus <lb/>triggers stronger neural activities via un-adapted path-<lb/>ways. Given the pervasiveness of synaptic adaptation, <lb/></body>

			<body>we are interested in how it affects the behavior of the <lb/>change detector in the simulation. In the simulation of <lb/>condition IV (Figure 8d), the strength of W EE is mod-<lb/>ulated by short-term adaptation according to the activ-<lb/>ities of presynaptic excitatory populations. After scan-<lb/>ning through the W s, we found that the number of W <lb/>solutions of both On and Off types are increased com-<lb/>pared with the default condition (Figure 8g). Many W <lb/>solutions of Pure type turn into On and Off types when <lb/>synaptic adaptation is applied (as examples in Figure <lb/>9). We suggests that the synaptic adaptation facilitates <lb/>change detection by bringing many otherwise Pure re-<lb/>sponses (usually reflected by saturated activities in the <lb/>excitatory populations) to either On or Off responses. <lb/>The OSR is not just sustained resonance. The <lb/>OSR differentiates itself from the Off response by its <lb/>peak latencies that are proportional to the SOA in repet-<lb/>itive stimuli, which reflects the role of temporal ex-<lb/>pectancy. The models that claim to account for the <lb/>OSR utilize either an adaptive approach [94] or popu-<lb/>lation coding approach [52] to maintain a short contin-<lb/>uation of neural activities (i.e., sustained resonances) <lb/>that preserve the periodicity of the repetitive stimuli. <lb/>However, the sustained resonances alone cannot fulfil <lb/>all observations in terms of peak amplitude and peak <lb/>latency of the response: (1) For the peak amplitude, <lb/>the OSR cannot simply rely on the sustained resonance <lb/>since the amplitude of OSR can be stronger than the <lb/>evoked response during entrainment [29]; (2) For the <lb/>peak latency, there should a constant delay upon one <lb/>more period at the end of the stimuli [2, 84], but the <lb/>sustained resonance rises exactly after one more period <lb/>at the end of the stimuli. Therefore, even though the <lb/>sustained resonance is time-locked to the next stimu-<lb/>lus, there seem to be extra neural circuits responsible <lb/>for the extra constant delay in peak latency and the <lb/>stronger peak amplitude than the evoked responses. In <lb/>the example simulation III, we demonstrate that the <lb/>simulated OSR solves the two issues mentioned above <lb/>(Figure 4). Our model suggests that the cortical OSR <lb/>can be interpreted as the cortical Off response after <lb/>the end of sustained resonance. The simulation result is <lb/>also in line with the finding that there is pre-activated <lb/>response at the time of expected onset followed by a <lb/>mismatch response [2, 9, 79]. <lb/>The OSR is not prediction signal. The omission <lb/>paradigm is often used to differentiate the contribution <lb/>of adaptation and prediction in MMN generation. This <lb/>is based on the assumption that the OSR could not arise <lb/>without any stimulus without the involvement of active <lb/>prediction. Interestingly, the models based on either the <lb/>adaptation or the prediction hypothesis interpret the <lb/>OSR as essentially different from the MMN triggered <lb/>by classic oddball paradigm. In the adaptation-based <lb/>model, the OSR is regarded as the rebound response <lb/>(i.e. the sustained resonance) rather than delayed N1 <lb/>[52, 53]. In the prediction-based model, the OSR is re-<lb/>garded as pure prediction signal that originates from <lb/>the memory unit rather than prediction error [102]. <lb/>Both interpretations imply that the OSR is essentially <lb/>different from the MMN because no additional NMDA <lb/>current is generated. The problem is that neither the <lb/>rebound response nor the prediction signal do explain <lb/>the two observations in terms of amplitude and latency <lb/>mentioned above. As demonstrated in the example sim-<lb/>ulations III and IV (Figure 4 and 5), we suggest that <lb/>the cortical OSR and MMN are essentially the same, <lb/>both being the activities of change detectors. <lb/>The cross-modal omission paradigm is also used to <lb/>emphasize the need for prediction. The brain can pre-<lb/>dict the upcoming event (e.g. handclap sound) from the <lb/>preceding events in another modality (e.g. silent hand-<lb/>clap video, or self-paced button press), and an OSR <lb/>is triggered if the expected stimulus is omitted. In a <lb/>motor-auditory (MA) paradigm, the participants show <lb/>OSRs when the sound that was expected to be initi-<lb/>ated by the self-paced button press is omitted [79]. In <lb/>a visual-auditory (VA) paradigm, an OSR is elicited <lb/>by occasionally omitting the sound that accompanied <lb/>a handclap video [90]. So far, the cross-modal OSRs <lb/>have not been considered by the existing computational <lb/>models. How does the generic deviance detection prin-<lb/>ciple view the OSRs in these cross-modal paradigms <lb/>that seem to be bound to an active predicting process? <lb/>Here we provide a different view point. First, the pre-<lb/>diction is likely to be supported by the association be-<lb/>tween the cross-modal events (e.g., handclap video or <lb/>button press, followed by a sound stimulus) that has <lb/>to be paired or learned (e.g., by Hebbian learning) in <lb/>advance either via direct or indirect connections. The <lb/>existence of association is reflected by the pre-activation <lb/>at 40 to 80 ms in the auditory cortex elicited by a visual <lb/>event [90] or by a motor event [79, 90]. There is no pre-<lb/>activation in the auditory cortex in the random condi-<lb/>tion where the button press is followed by a randomly <lb/>selected sound from 48 samples in the MA paradigm <lb/>and there is also no OSR thereafter [79], suggesting <lb/>that there are not enough trials to associate the but-<lb/>ton press to all 48 sound samples. Second, due to the <lb/>pre-activation in the auditory cortex, the MA and VA <lb/>paradigms can then be regarded as a classic oddball <lb/>paradigm where the standard is a &apos;weak-strong&apos; sound <lb/>pair and the deviant is a &apos;weak-omission&apos; sound pair. In <lb/>this sense, the cross-modal omission paradigm resem-<lb/></body>

			<body>bles an &apos;intensity MMN&apos; or &apos;duration MMN&apos; paradigms <lb/>rather than an omission paradigm. This analogy ex-<lb/>plains why OSRs are elicited in the VA and MA con-<lb/>ditions but not in auditory-only condition (like a clas-<lb/>sic omission paradigm) [90] because the SOAs (average <lb/>1155 ms) in the paradigm is above the temporal win-<lb/>dow of integration (TWI) for temporal feature such as <lb/>periodicity but still within the TWI for identity fea-<lb/>tures such as intensity and duration. The analogy can <lb/>be verified if the VA and MA conditions fail to elicit <lb/>&apos;omission&apos; responses when the SOAs are larger than <lb/>TWI for identify features. Based on this analogy, the <lb/>deviance detection that takes place in the auditory cor-<lb/>tex stands alone from the process of association, which <lb/>explains why the pre-activation does not differ between <lb/>the 50% and 12% chance of sound omission, while the <lb/>mismatch response following the pre-activation depends <lb/>on the proportion of omission trials for both VA and <lb/>MA conditions [90], because association is less likely to <lb/>be reduced by the 50% omissions, but deviance detec-<lb/>tion relies much on probability. Taken together, given <lb/>the pre-activation via association and the analogy to <lb/>classic MMN paradigm, the computational models that <lb/>account for classic MMN (e.g., either prediction-based <lb/>or not) could potentially also account for the mismatch <lb/>responses in cross-modal omission paradigm. From the <lb/>viewpoint of generic deviance detection principle, the <lb/>process of deviance detection (including regularity for-<lb/>mation and change detection) takes place locally in the <lb/>auditory cortex, even in the case of cross-modal VA and <lb/>MA paradigms. <lb/>Testable predictions. In terms of the location of re-<lb/>sponse: (1) The cortical Off response, cortical OSR, and <lb/>MMN should show similar laminar profiles, for example, <lb/>sink in layer 2/3 [37]. (2) Inhibited activity of inhibitory <lb/>interneurons near the location of the deviance response <lb/>should be observed during stimulus presentation (regu-<lb/>larity formation). Taking the pitch MMN for an exam-<lb/>ple (assuming cortical area A has best frequency (BF) <lb/>of standard tone A, area B has BF of deviant tone B, <lb/>and area X is the location of MMN), the inhibitory in-<lb/>terneurons in area X should be inhibited by tone A. <lb/>In addition, area X can be a broader area (which may <lb/>still include area B) that surrounds area A. In terms of <lb/>the effect of NMDA-r antagonists: (1) The cortical OSR <lb/>should be sensitive to the NMDA-r antagonists as are <lb/>the other MMNs. (2) The amplitude of entrainment to <lb/>periodic stimuli in omission paradigms should be also <lb/>reduced by NMDA-r antagonists. Note: this prediction <lb/>may have been partially supported by impaired delta <lb/>entrainment in patients with schizophrenia [49]. <lb/></body>
