We sought to determine how the detection and incidence of <lb/>bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been influenced by the pandemic. We performed a <lb/>retrospective analysis of blood culture data in the province of Ontario, Canada, from 1 <lb/>January 2017 to 31 December 2020. Outcomes included a weekly incidence of blood <lb/>culture tests, BSIs, and contaminant results. Results were stratified by hospital, commun <lb/>ity, and long-term care (LTC) settings. An interrupted time series analysis using segmen <lb/>ted regression models was used to determine changes in outcome incidence/prevalence <lb/>during the pre-and peri-pandemic periods. Of the 14,083,853 individuals included, <lb/>129,329 (0.92%) developed a bloodstream infection. The blood culture ordering rate <lb/>increased during the pandemic in the hospital setting only [Incidence rate ratio (IRR) <lb/>1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.19]. There was a decline in the incidence of <lb/>community-acquired (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99) and LTC-acquired (IRR 0.85, 95% CI <lb/>0.76-0.94) BSIs. Hospital-acquired BSIs were unchanged. The proportion of blood culture <lb/>contaminants increased in the community (7% increase, P &lt; 0.01) and LTC settings (14% <lb/>increase, P &lt; 0.05). There was decreased incidence of community-acquired Streptococcus <lb/>pneumoniae (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.57) and Staphylococcus aureus (IRR 0.91, 95% CI <lb/>0.84-0.99) bacteremia. Pandemic-related changes in the performance of blood cultures <lb/>and the epidemiology of BSIs have implications for current and future pandemic <lb/>antimicrobial use, healthcare resource allocation, and hospital and laboratory policies. <lb/>IMPORTANCE Bacterial infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality <lb/>worldwide. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have demonstrated <lb/>pandemic-related shifts in the epidemiology of bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) <lb/>in the general population and in specific hospital systems. Our study uses a large, <lb/>comprehensive data set stratified by setting [community, long-term care (LTC), and <lb/>hospital] to uniquely demonstrate how the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on BSIs <lb/>and testing practices varies by healthcare setting. We showed that, while the number <lb/>of false-positive blood culture results generally increased during the pandemic, this <lb/>effect did not apply to hospitalized patients. We also found that many infections were <lb/>likely under-recognized in patients in the community and in LTC, demonstrating the <lb/>importance of maintaining healthcare for these groups during crises. Last, we found a <lb/>decrease in infections caused by certain pathogens in the community, suggesting some <lb/>secondary benefits of pandemic-related public health measures. <lb/>KEYWORDS bloodstream infections, pandemic, COVID-19, blood cultures, epidemiol <lb/>ogy <lb/>November/December 2023 Volume 11 Issue 6 <lb/>10.1128/spectrum.02630-23 1 <lb/>Editor Ahmed Babiker, Emory University School of <lb/>Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA <lb/>Address correspondence to Matt Driedger, <lb/>madriedger@toh.ca. <lb/>The authors declare no conflict of interest. <lb/>See the funding table on p. 11. <lb/>Received 26 June 2023 <lb/>Accepted 11 October 2023 <lb/>Published 17 November 2023 <lb/>Copyright Â© 2023 Driedger et al.

			<body>T he COVID-19 pandemic has dominated recent efforts within public health and <lb/>infectious diseases, yet bacterial infection remains a critically important global <lb/>challenge. Despite the low rate of bacterial co-infection among SARS-CoV-2-infected <lb/>patients (1, 2), various pandemic-related factors have likely altered the incidence and <lb/>microbiology of bacterial infections. These include an increased incidence of hospi <lb/>tal-acquired bacterial infections, the use of empiric antimicrobials among patients <lb/>hospitalized with COVID-19 (3-5), patient crowding, and shortages in health human <lb/>resources and personal protective equipment (PPE) (6). Conversely, mitigating factors <lb/>may include improved hospital infection prevention and control measures and reduced <lb/>contact patterns in the community (6). <lb/>Large-scale multicenter studies can be used to determine population-level changes <lb/>in the epidemiology of invasive bacterial infections prior to and during the COVID-19 <lb/>pandemic. However, existing multicenter studies are generally limited to data from select <lb/>hospital systems (7-12) and intensive care units (ICUs) (13-16), with varying outcomes <lb/>perhaps relating to institution-specific factors during the pandemic. Larger nation-wide <lb/>studies, on the other hand, have generally been limited to hospital-reported nosocomial <lb/>infections in administrative surveillance data, which may be subject to reporting errors, <lb/>particularly during the pandemic onset and its associated institutional pressures (15-19). <lb/>Furthermore, while the pandemic would be expected to have had differential effects <lb/>on community-acquired infections compared to those acquired in hospitals and other <lb/>institutions, only a few studies have stratified their analysis accordingly. One recently <lb/>published large multicenter study in the United States demonstrated an increase in both <lb/>community-and hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (BSIs) during the first year of <lb/>the pandemic (20), whereas another analysis demonstrated an increase in only hospital-<lb/>acquired infections (21). Importantly, both studies utilized only one pre-pandemic year <lb/>as the comparison period, and so they have limited ability to control for pre-existing <lb/>trends. <lb/>In order to fill these research gaps, we used an interrupted time-series approach to <lb/>determine changes in the incidence and microbiology of BSIs during the first year of the <lb/>COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Ontario. We hypothesized that there would be <lb/>increased blood culture ordering and blood culture contamination in the hospital setting <lb/>due to staffing shortages and changes in PPE protocols, whereas culture ordering rates <lb/>would decrease in long-term care (LTC) and community settings due to pandemic-rela <lb/>ted changes to the provision of healthcare in these settings. We also predicted increased <lb/>BSI incidence among hospitalized patients and decreased BSI in the community among <lb/>organisms associated with transmissible infectious syndromes. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Study design and data sources <lb/>We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and microbiology data to determine <lb/>changes in the incidence rates of bacteremia in the province of Ontario, Canada, prior to <lb/>and during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cohort was derived using data <lb/>sets at ICES (previously the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences), which were linked <lb/>using unique encoded identifiers. Data sets included the registered persons database <lb/>(RPDB), the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database <lb/>(CIHI-DAD), the Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS), the Ontario Laboratories <lb/>Information System (OLIS), and others. Linked data sets included demographic and <lb/>laboratory data from all individuals in the province of Ontario eligible for the provincial <lb/>health insurance program. Since healthcare in Ontario is publicly funded, this cohort <lb/>captures information from virtually all 14.5 million residents of Ontario. The use of these <lb/>data is authorized under Section 45 of Ontario&apos;s Personal Health Information Protection <lb/>Act and does not require research ethics board review (22). <lb/></body>

			<body>Inclusion criteria and study period <lb/>We analyzed all individuals in Ontario from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020. We <lb/>excluded individuals with invalid birth dates, death dates, or sex. We also excluded <lb/>individuals who were not Ontario residents or had an invalid ICES linkage number. <lb/>Demographic information <lb/>Demographic data including age and sex were extracted, along with clinical data <lb/>including the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index and recent COVID-19 infection (any <lb/>microbiologic diagnosis of COVID-19 in the preceding 3 months). <lb/>Outcome definitions <lb/>The occurrence of a bloodstream infection was the primary outcome of interest. BSI <lb/>was defined as blood cultures demonstrating any organism except for Corynebacterium <lb/>spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Micrococcus spp., or Bacillus spp., which were classified as <lb/>contaminants because they are commonly isolated from the skin and rarely cause BSI. <lb/>Blood cultures of the same pathogen within a 14-day window were defined as a single <lb/>BSI episode. Since the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is typically <lb/>interpreted as a contaminant, only sustained CoNS BSI was included as a BSI episode, <lb/>defined as the same CoNS species detected in two separate blood cultures on separate <lb/>dates within 14 days. CoNS contaminants, defined as CoNS isolated from cultures for only <lb/>one day within a 14-day window, were reported separately as a proxy for contamination <lb/>rate. <lb/>Secondary outcomes included BSI by pathogen. All pathogens with sufficient <lb/>incidence rates to allow interrupted time series (ITS) analysis were included. Common <lb/>resistance profiles were reported, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus <lb/>(MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms (ESBL), carbapene <lb/>mase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), <lb/>as determined by susceptibility testing by regional clinical laboratories. Blood culture <lb/>ordering rates were also expressed as total blood cultures performed per patient-day (or <lb/>per person for the community cohort). <lb/>Incidence rates <lb/>Primary and secondary outcomes were reported in aggregate and by setting. Commun <lb/>ity-acquired BSI (CBSI) was defined as BSI detected from a blood culture drawn in an <lb/>ambulatory setting, in the emergency department, or within 2 days of admission; LTC-BSI <lb/>as blood cultures performed on a patient currently residing in an LTC or within 2 days <lb/>of admission; and hospital-acquired BSI (HBSI) as detected from blood cultures drawn <lb/>greater than 2 days after admission. Weekly incidence rates were calculated as a function <lb/>of total patient days for the hospital and LTC settings and the eligible population (total <lb/>population minus population in LTC and hospital settings) for community settings. <lb/>Patient-days and eligible populations used to calculate incidence rates were determined <lb/>on weekly index dates. Due to reporting limitations on administrative data, incidence <lb/>rate data were displayed graphically only if they reflected a minimum case count of 5, <lb/>resulting in the censoring of individual data points from figures (not analyses). For some <lb/>outcomes with very low rates, monthly incidence rates are shown in figures, but weekly <lb/>rates were used for underlying analytic models. <lb/>Interrupted time series analysis <lb/>Interrupted time series regression models were fitted to detect changes in the incidence <lb/>of BSI and other outcomes of interest during the pandemic. All ITS models included a <lb/>binary indicator to determine the change in weekly rates of BSI and other secondary <lb/>outcomes during the pandemic period (1 March-31 December 2020) compared to the <lb/>pre-pandemic period (1 January 2017-29 February 2020). 1 March 2020 was selected <lb/></body>

		<body>as this was the month during which the Ontario government declared a state of <lb/>emergency requiring the closure of public facilities, masking, and other public health <lb/>recommendations. We used negative binomial models with log links for rates (blood <lb/>culture and BSI) and binomial models with logit link for proportions (contaminants). <lb/>Pre-pandemic temporal trends (slope) and seasonality (where visually present) were <lb/>incorporated into all-time series in order to control for these variables in determining <lb/>the pandemic effect. Seasonality was modeled using annual sine and cosine functions <lb/>to control for seasonality in outcomes and was applied to all time series that visually <lb/>demonstrated seasonal patterns. Autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and residual <lb/>plots were used to assess model validity. Graphs of weekly or monthly BSI were used to <lb/>visually examine changes in incidence over time. All statistical analyses were performed <lb/>using SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (Cary, NC). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>At the start of the historical cohort, the open cohort included 14,084,853 individuals, <lb/>with 13,992,030 in the community, 75,941 residing in LTCs, and 16,882 who were <lb/>hospitalized. A total of 129,329 individuals throughout the cohort had BSI, including <lb/>7,196 with LTC-BSI, 30,836 with HBSI, and 36,780 with CBSI. Baseline demographic <lb/>characteristics are shown in Table 1. Age, Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index, and sex <lb/>were comparable before and during the pandemic. Patients with HBSI were more likely <lb/>to have had a preceding COVID-19 infection compared to those with CBSI (6.8% vs 0.4%, <lb/>Fisher&apos;s exact test P &lt; 0.001). <lb/>Blood culture ordering <lb/>Figure 1 demonstrates the blood culture ordering rate by setting. In the hospital setting, <lb/>the weekly blood culture rate increased above pre-pandemic levels (IRR 1.09, 95% CI <lb/>1.01-1.19) despite decreased patient volumes (Fig. S1). Blood culture ordering rates in <lb/>the community and LTC settings were unchanged. <lb/>Probable blood culture contamination <lb/>The proportion of CoNS contaminants relative to the weekly blood culture ordering rate <lb/>increased in the community-acquired [Odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13] and the <lb/>LTC-acquired settings (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29) (Fig. 2; Table S2). There was a decrease <lb/>in the proportion of contaminants in the hospital setting (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97). <lb/>BSI incidence <lb/>Weekly BSI incidence trends are depicted in Fig. 3A through C. There was no change in <lb/>the incidence of HBSI (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.11).

			<body>pandemic onset in community-acquired (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99) and LTC-acquired <lb/>(IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94) settings. <lb/>Microbiology of BSI <lb/>In the community-acquired setting (Fig. S2; Fig. 2), the pandemic onset was associated <lb/>with a notable decline in the incidence of S. pneumoniae BSI (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.57) <lb/>and a decline in S. aureus BSI (IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99). In the hospital setting (Table <lb/>2; Fig. S3), there was an increase in sustained CoNS BSI (IRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) <lb/>and Klebsiella spp. BSI (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31) figures not shown due to low case <lb/>counts. Changes in the LTC-acquired setting are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S4. There was <lb/>a significant decrease in the incidence of LTC-acquired Escherichia coli (IRR 0.70, 95% CI <lb/>0.52-0.92; figures not shown due to low case counts). <lb/>Resistant organisms <lb/>There were no observed differences in the incidence of bacteremia with resistant <lb/>organisms (MRSA, ESBL, and VRE) in the hospital setting during the pandemic (Table <lb/>S3; figures not shown due to low case counts). Insufficient incidence rates of BSIs <lb/>from resistant organisms precluded analysis in community-acquired and LTC-acquired <lb/>settings. <lb/>Sensitivity analyses <lb/>We performed a sensitivity analysis considering the possibility of a post-pandemic slope <lb/>change (based on visual inspection) in three instances: blood culture ordering rates in <lb/>the community, blood culture ordering rates in LTCs, and BSI incidence in LTCs (Table S4). <lb/>While there was a post-pandemic slope change detected in each case, the remainder of <lb/>the pandemic effect findings were not largely impacted. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In this large province-wide study, we demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic onset <lb/>was associated with changes in the quality and number of blood cultures performed <lb/>and in the incidence and microbiology of BSIs. There was an increase in the number <lb/>of blood cultures performed on hospitalized patients. Blood culture contamination <lb/>increased in the community-and LTC-origin cultures.

			<body>during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stratifying results by setting of blood culture collection <lb/>allowed for novel findings, including that community and hospitalized BSI rates were <lb/>differentially influenced by the pandemic and that the increase in contaminant rates <lb/>during the pandemic is largely attributable to those cultures performed in emergency <lb/>department or outpatient settings. The inclusion of data from 3 years of pre-pandemic <lb/>data allowed us to model each outcome to control for seasonal and temporal trends <lb/>present prior to the pandemic, which strengthens the validity of our findings given the <lb/>seasonal variation of bacterial infections. <lb/>Smaller cohort studies suggest that while contamination rates increased overall <lb/>during the pandemic (7, 8), the specific department implicated (ICU, inpatient, or <lb/>emergency department) varied by institution (13, 23, 24). Similarly, we observed a <lb/>disproportionate increase in blood cultures ordered in the hospital setting without <lb/>a change in the proportion of contaminants, whereas there was an increase in the <lb/>proportion of contaminated cultures in the LTC and community settings, including <lb/>from outpatient laboratories, emergency departments, and hospitals within 2 days of <lb/>admission. This may suggest that the various factors theorized to explain the increased <lb/>contaminant rates during the pandemic (new PPE protocols, increased workload, <lb/>reassignment of nursing staff to new units) have especially affected emergency <lb/>departments and ambulatory laboratories rather than admitted patients. Additionally, <lb/>certain pressures unique to the emergency department, including patient acuity, the <lb/>backlog of patients due to saturated wards, and the proportion of patients requiring PPE, <lb/>may have contributed (25). Given that contaminant blood cultures lead to unnecessary <lb/>empiric antimicrobial use, our findings demonstrate a potential underappreciated cost of <lb/>the pandemic to patients, including adverse drug events, antimicrobial resistance, and <lb/>length of stay (26). <lb/>We demonstrated no change in hospital-acquired BSI during the pandemic. While this <lb/>mirrors the findings of smaller studies (14, 27), most cohorts (13, 17, 18, 28, 29) have <lb/>reported an increase in hospital-acquired bacterial infections. While Ontario faced similar <lb/>pandemic-related factors as other settings, the decrease in patient volumes in our cohort <lb/>suggests that crowding may have had a lesser impact on BSI in our setting, which may <lb/>explain our findings. The increases in gram-positive infections likely relate to increased <lb/>line-associated infections in hospitals, which may have been balanced by a decreased <lb/>incidence of other nosocomial bacteremias, perhaps due to factors such as the delay of <lb/>elective surgeries. <lb/>The observed changes in the microbiology of BSI likely represent true epidemiologic <lb/>shifts during the pandemic. Decreased community-acquired S. pneumoniae infections <lb/>have been described in recent studies (30-32); we identified this same trend in addition <lb/>to a decline in S. aureus. These changes may be due to public health measures leading <lb/>to a decrease in both the community transmission of these pathogens and of respira <lb/>tory viruses such as influenza that can result in secondary bacterial pneumonia due <lb/>to these pathogens (33, 34). In support of this hypothesis, there has recently been an <lb/>increase in these pathogens attributed to the cessation of public health measures (35, <lb/>36). In the hospital setting, the pandemic was associated with an increase in CoNS <lb/>BSI. Similar trends have been reported in other studies (9, 37) and among SARS-CoV-2-<lb/>infected patients specifically (3, 4, 37), with explanations including the use of central <lb/>venous devices, increased line infections due to altered infection prevention protocols <lb/>to prevent staff exposure, and empiric use of antimicrobials in patients with COVID-19, <lb/>including third-generation cephalosporins, which may be selected for these organisms <lb/>(5, 9). <lb/>Community-and LTC-onset BSI decreased in our cohort. A proportion of this signal <lb/>represents a true decrease in the incidence of BSI due to reduced community transmis <lb/>sion. However, as a significant proportion of community-acquired BSI events involve <lb/>pathogens that are typically implicated in &quot;endogenous&quot; infectious disease syndromes <lb/>(e.g., urinary tract infection) not predominantly transmitted through person-to-person <lb/>contact, this finding may be attributable to under-detection due to reluctance to seek <lb/></body>

		<body>care during the pandemic (38). Similarly, the decline in reported LTC-BSI, including <lb/>Gram-negative organisms such as E. coli, may be due to under-detection during the <lb/>early part of the pandemic as a result of well-documented challenges in meeting care <lb/>needs in Ontario LTCs during the early pandemic and directives to care for persons in the <lb/>community due to issues related to hospital capacity (39). <lb/>Certain limitations should be acknowledged. First, while patients with bacteremia <lb/>are typically quite unwell and seek medical attention, the incidence of positive blood <lb/>cultures would not have captured all true bacteremia episodes, especially as pandemic-<lb/>related factors may have prevented patients from accessing care and increased palliative <lb/>supports in LTCs that may have reduced transfers to acute care settings. Second, limiting <lb/>our analysis to blood culture data allowed us to generally discern true infection among <lb/>a large data set while avoiding contaminant bacteria from non-sterile cultures. However, <lb/>individual chart review is required to definitively discern infection from contaminants <lb/>even among blood cultures, and certain contaminant culture results may have been <lb/>misclassified as true BSI; this limitation also applies to our classification of persistent <lb/>and intermittent CoNS BSI. Furthermore, without other corresponding cultures, we were <lb/>unable to determine the diagnoses underlying BSI (e.g., S. pneumoniae BSI secondary <lb/>to meningitis vs pneumonia). Last, since our analysis was limited to the first year of <lb/>the pandemic, our findings do not represent the effects of more recent phases of the <lb/>pandemic. <lb/>Our findings serve to highlight certain future priorities. First, our findings related <lb/>to blood culture contamination emphasize the need for institution-level surveillance <lb/>and quality improvement initiatives, such as phlebotomy and central venous catheter <lb/>protocols, to monitor and prevent potentially harmful and costly consequences of care, <lb/>especially during times of healthcare and public health crises. Second, the potentially <lb/>undetected BSI in LTCs underscores the need for equitable healthcare to ensure that <lb/>vulnerable individuals are adequately cared for in a pandemic context. Last, the observed <lb/>changes in the microbiology and resistance profiles of BSI provide hypotheses for <lb/>prospective research to better characterize the modifiable factors in clinical care (e.g., <lb/>empiric antimicrobials) and infection prevention and control measures (e.g., isolation <lb/>procedures, room sharing) that may underlie our findings and how these can be <lb/>optimized in advance of future pandemics. <lb/>In summary, we found that pandemic-related factors led to changes in the detection, <lb/>incidence, and microbiology of BSI and that these effects differed by patient setting. <lb/>Future studies should aim to characterize the specific modifiable factors that underlie <lb/>the relationship between emerging viral pandemics and the ever-present challenges of <lb/>invasive bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance. <lb/></body>
