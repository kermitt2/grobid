			<front>Abstract. Like many taxa, the Zetaproteobacteria lack well-defined taxonomic divisions, <lb/>making it difficult to compare between studies. We designed ZetaHunter to reproducibly <lb/>assign 16S rRNA gene sequences to previously-described OTUs based on a curated <lb/>database. While ZetaHunter can use any given database, we include a curated <lb/>classification of publically-available Zetaproteobacteria. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction. Taxonomic groups with limited cultivated representatives are often <lb/>lumped into a single taxonomic label encompassing multiple distinct ecological units. <lb/>This makes it difficult to explicitly discuss the abundance, significance, and niche <lb/>preference of these units between studies. One group with poor taxonomic resolution is <lb/>the Zetaproteobacteria class, which is only accurately classified to this taxonomic level <lb/>by standard small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene classification tools. <lb/>ZetaHunter allows for reproducible, higher-resolution comparisons across studies by <lb/>using a curated dataset with a defined taxonomy based on operational taxonomic units <lb/>(OTUs). ZetaHunter comes with a curated database to identify the members of the <lb/>Zetaproteobacteria, though it may be used with any curated 16S rRNA gene database. <lb/>ZetaHunter implementation. ZetaHunter is a command line program written in Ruby, <lb/>designed to assign user-supplied 16S rRNA gene sequences to OTUs defined by a <lb/>reference sequence database. ZetaHunter can be used on Linux, MacOSX, and Windows <lb/>platforms through a Docker container, or through installation from source (Linux and <lb/>MacOSX only). By default, ZetaHunter uses a curated database of Zetaproteobacteria <lb/>16S rRNA genes from ARB SILVA (release 128) and Zetaproteobacteria genomes from <lb/>JGI&apos;s Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) (see Supplemental Table 1). <lb/>Zetaproteobacteria OTU (ZOTU) definitions include those reported by McAllister et al. <lb/>(2011) at 97% identity, maintaining ZOTU number order from ZOTU1 to ZOTU28 for <lb/>ease in comparisons across studies. Numbered ZOTUs from ZOTU29 upward were <lb/>discovered after 2011. Sequences for use in ZetaHunter must be aligned using SINA <lb/>(Pruesse et al., 2012). <lb/>The default pipeline of ZetaHunter (Figure 1) takes SINA-aligned 16S rRNA <lb/>gene sequences and processes them as follows: 1) Input sequences are masked to the <lb/>1,282 bp used by McAllister et al. (2011). 2) Sequences are checked for chimeras using <lb/></body>

			<body>mothur&apos;s uchime algorithm (Schloss et al., 2009; Edgar et al., 2011). 2) SortmeRNA is <lb/>used to cluster new sequences with the reference database, assigning ZOTU based on <lb/>genetic distance (closed reference binning; Kopylova et al., 2012). 3) The remaining <lb/>sequences are clustered into novel OTUs (NewZetaOtus) with mothur (de novo binning; <lb/>average neighbor; numbered by abundance) (Schloss et al., 2009). 4) Summary files <lb/>(including final ZOTU calls and closest database hits), a biom table showing OTU <lb/>abundance per sample, and OTU network files are exported for use. The ZetaHunter <lb/>database includes 21 Proteobacteria outgroup sequences, allowing ZetaHunter to flag <lb/>sequences potentially outside the Zetaproteobacteria. Additionally, sequences that are <lb/>short, chimeric, or singletons are also flagged. This pipeline is an implementation of <lb/>open-reference OTU picking similar to the one found in QIIME (Navas-Molina et al., <lb/>2013). <lb/>To use ZetaHunter for non-Zetaproteobacteria, users need: 1) a database of SINA-<lb/>aligned 16S rRNA gene sequences, 2) a sequence mask with asterisks at each informative <lb/>alignment column to be used for taxonomic assignment, and 3) a tab-delimited file <lb/>assigning each sequence to a particular taxonomic group at the similarity threshold <lb/>desired by the user. <lb/></body>
