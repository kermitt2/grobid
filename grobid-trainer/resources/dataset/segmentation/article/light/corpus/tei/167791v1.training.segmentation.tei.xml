We <lb/>were primarily interested in the effects of sustained consumption throughout pregnancy (data <lb/>available for five cohorts, 3,075 mother-child pairs), which represents a prolonged prenatal exposure <lb/>to alcohol, but we also explored binge-drinking and timing-specific exposures. In addition to looking <lb/>for differential methylation at individual CpG sites, we also used two different methods, Comb-P and <lb/>DMRcate, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). <lb/>We found no strong evidence of association between any of our alcohol exposure measures and <lb/>DNA methylation at any individual CpG site. Using Comb-P, we identified 19 DMRs in the offspring of <lb/>mothers who drank throughout pregnancy compared to the offspring of mothers who gave up <lb/>drinking at the start of pregnancy, but these were not validated using DMRcate. <lb/>In this multi-cohort study of the general population we found no evidence that maternal alcohol <lb/>consumption during pregnancy is associated with offspring cord blood DNA methylation, which is in <lb/>stark contrast to the multiple, strong associations that previous studies have found for maternal <lb/>smoking. However, it is possible that a combination of a larger sample size, higher doses, different <lb/>timings of exposure and a more global assessment of genomic DNA methylation might show <lb/>evidence of association. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>It is well known that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause Fetal Alcohol Spectrum <lb/>Disorders (FASD), a spectrum of disorders characterized by a continuum of structural and <lb/>neurodevelopmental abnormalities, with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) at the more severe end of <lb/>the spectrum [1-3]. The severity of FASD appears to depend largely on the timing, dose and <lb/>frequency of exposure to alcohol, with heavy exposure in the latter half of the first trimester being <lb/>associated with the most severe effect [4,5]. However, in the general population most pregnant <lb/>women do not drink at the doses required to cause FASD. For example, in population-based studies <lb/>from Ireland, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, around 70% (range 67% to 77%) of women who <lb/>reported drinking in the first trimester consumed seven units or fewer per week, which is considered <lb/>light-to-moderate consumption. In the second trimester, nearly all women who drank (range 99% to <lb/>100%) consumed seven units or fewer per week [6]. Evidence of an effect of light-to-moderate levels <lb/>of prenatal alcohol exposure is sparse and inconsistent. Although the majority of systematic reviews <lb/>and studies published after these reviews have not found convincing evidence of association <lb/>between light-to-moderate drinking and adverse offspring health and neurodevelopment [7-14], a <lb/>recent comprehensive review of prospective studies found suggestive evidence of an association <lb/>between mothers consuming up to four UK units of alcohol per week and babies born small-for-<lb/>gestational age or preterm [15]. Furthermore, results from quasi-experimental study designs, which <lb/>are more robust to the presence of confounding by parental socio-economic factors, have shown <lb/>some evidence of effect of (mostly light-to-moderate) maternal alcohol consumption on offspring <lb/>cognition and behaviour [16-18]. The inconsistency of findings may be explained by the failure to <lb/>adequately control for certain confounding factors, such as socioeconomic position, diet and <lb/>ethnicity [19], which affect offspring outcomes both prenatally and postnatally, and could therefore <lb/>bias any potentially small effect of light-to-moderate drinking in pregnancy [20]. Suggestions of harm <lb/>from these later studies, together with findings from animal experiments, have prompted the UK <lb/>Chief Medical Officer to recently revise the guidelines for alcohol drinking in pregnancy to <lb/>recommend abstention, based on the precautionary principle [21]. <lb/>Whether there is a causal association between light-to-moderate drinking in pregnancy and <lb/>children&apos;s health outcomes is an important question. Identifying a possible biological pathway <lb/>showing effects at birth would be a first step towards providing an answer. Currently, precise <lb/>biological mechanisms underlying potential adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are <lb/>unknown. However, epigenetic modifications have been suggested as one such potential mediator, <lb/>with some evidence that this is the case for prenatal exposure to smoking [22-24]. <lb/>Animal studies suggest that alcohol exposure affects DNA methylation levels both globally, through <lb/>its antagonistic effect on methyl donors such as folate [25,26], and in a gene-specific fashion [27,28]. <lb/>Mouse pups exposed to alcohol during the highly epigenetically-sensitive intrauterine period show <lb/>dose-and timing-specific epigenetic effects, including DNA methylation effects that correlate with <lb/>long-lasting changes in gene expression and could potentially drive offspring adverse outcomes [29]. <lb/>Similar experiments are impossible in humans for obvious ethical reasons. However, there is some <lb/>evidence that treatment with a low physiologically relevant dose of ethanol induces genome-wide <lb/>changes in DNA methylation in human embryonic stem cells [30]. In addition, a recent observational <lb/>study of 110 children with FASD and 96 controls found genome-wide differences in buccal epithelial <lb/>cell DNA methylation [31]. It is still unknown whether light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure is <lb/>associated with differential DNA methylation in human offspring. <lb/>In this study, we meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) summary statistics from <lb/>six population-based cohort studies within the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) <lb/>Consortium to investigate DNA methylation profiles in the cord blood of newborns differentially <lb/>exposed to alcohol in utero. We also compared these associations with those recently found in <lb/>studies of 1) differential buccal cell DNA methylation in children with FASD compared to controls <lb/>[31], and 2) differential whole blood DNA methylation in adults in the general population who drink <lb/>light-to-moderately compared to adults who do not drink [32]. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Participating cohorts <lb/>A total of six independent cohorts from four countries participated in this study, all were members <lb/>of the PACE Consortium. Detailed methods for each cohort are provided in the Supplementary <lb/>Material (File S1). All cohorts had data on maternal alcohol consumption before and/or during <lb/>pregnancy <lb/>and <lb/>DNA <lb/>
			methylation <lb/>data <lb/>as <lb/>measured <lb/>using <lb/>the <lb/>Illumina <lb/>Infinium <lb/>HumanMethylation450k BeadChip array [33]. In alphabetical order, these cohorts were: The Avon <lb/>Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) [34-37] from the UK, Groningen Expert Center <lb/>for Kids with Obesity (GECKO) [38] and Generation R (GENR) [39,40] from the Netherlands, two <lb/>independent datasets from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa1, MoBa2) [41,42], <lb/>and Project Viva (Viva) from the USA [43]. <lb/>Maternal alcohol consumption (exposure) <lb/>Cohorts assessed maternal alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy via questionnaires <lb/>completed by the mothers during pregnancy. We were primarily interested in the effects of <lb/>sustained consumption throughout pregnancy, which represents a longer prenatal exposure to <lb/>alcohol, potentially interfering with all stages of embryonic and fetal development. Therefore, our <lb/>main exposure of interest was a binary variable comparing offspring of mothers who drank both <lb/>before pregnancy and in the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy to offspring of mothers who <lb/>consumed alcohol before pregnancy but not during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. <lb/>Using this definition, we hoped to compare offspring of mothers who continued to drink alcohol <lb/>after finding out they were pregnant to offspring of mothers who stopped drinking. From previous <lb/>research we know that women who drink in the second trimester tend to do so at light-to-moderate <lb/>levels [6]. <lb/>Cohorts ran secondary models assessing binge drinking during pregnancy and timing-specific alcohol <lb/>consumption: before pregnancy, during the first trimester and during the second and/or third <lb/>trimester. Binge drinking was defined as four, five or six (depending on the cohort) or more glasses <lb/>per occasion at least once at any time point in pregnancy compared to consuming alcohol before <lb/>pregnancy <lb/>and <lb/>drinking <lb/>in <lb/>moderation <lb/>(i.e. <lb/>no <lb/>binge <lb/>drinking) <lb/>during <lb/>pregnancy. <lb/>Alcohol <lb/>consumption before pregnancy, during the first trimester and during the second and/or third <lb/>trimester were all defined using four categories of exposure: 1) no drinking, 2) less than one glass <lb/>per week, 3) one to six glasses per week, 4) seven or more glasses per week. <lb/>Covariates <lb/>All models were adjusted for maternal age (years), maternal education (variable defined by each <lb/>individual cohort) and maternal smoking status (the preferred categorisation was into three groups: <lb/>no smoking in pregnancy, stopped smoking in early pregnancy, smoking throughout pregnancy. A <lb/>binary categorisation of any versus no smoking was also acceptable). All cohorts also adjusted for <lb/>technical covariates either by including a batch variable (for example chip ID) as a model covariate or <lb/>by generating and adjusting for surrogate variables. All models were run with and without <lb/>adjustment for cell counts, which were estimated using the Houseman method [44]. The analyses <lb/>were completed before a cord blood reference panel was widely available, so cohorts used an adult <lb/>whole blood reference [45] to estimate the proportion of B-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, <lb/>granulocytes, NK-cells and monocytes in each sample. <lb/>Methylation measurements (outcome) <lb/>DNA from cord blood underwent bisulfite conversion using the EZ-96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo <lb/>Research Corporation, Irvine, USA). DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium <lb/>HumanMethylation450k BeadChip assay at Illumina or in cohort-specific laboratories. Each cohort <lb/>conducted its own quality control and normalisation of methylation data, as detailed in the <lb/>Supplementary Material (File S1). In all analyses, cohorts used normalised, untransformed beta-<lb/>values. As a consortium, we have found that extreme outliers in methylation data, likely caused by <lb/>technical error or rare genetic variants, can have a large influence on results. Therefore, potential <lb/>outliers were removed. Such outliers were defined using the Tukey method [46], in which an outlier <lb/>is any value less than the lower quartile minus three times the interquartile range, or more than the <lb/>upper quartile plus three times the interquartile range. This method is appropriate as it is not <lb/>dependent on distributional assumptions of the data. <lb/>Cohort-specific statistical analysis <lb/>Each cohort performed independent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) according to a <lb/>common, pre-specified analysis plan. Models were run using multiple robust linear regression (rlm in <lb/>the MASS R package [47]) in an attempt to control for potential heteroscedasticity in the <lb/>methylation data. Alcohol consumption was modelled as the exposure and cord blood DNA <lb/>methylation was the outcome, with adjustment for covariates (and estimated cell counts). <lb/>Meta-analysis <lb/>We performed fixed-effects meta-analysis weighted by the inverse of the variance with METAL [48]. <lb/>We then excluded control probes (N=65) and probes mapped to the X (N=11,232) or Y (N=416) <lb/>chromosomes. This left a total of 473,864 probes. Multiple testing was accounted for by controlling <lb/>the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% using the method by Benjamini and Hochberg [49]. Probes were <lb/>annotated according to hg19 using the IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 R package <lb/>[50]. <lb/>Sensitivity analyses <lb/>For the top 500 sites with the smallest P-values in our main model (sustained drinking), we repeated <lb/>the meta-analysis using a random effects model, to allow for potential differences in effect sizes <lb/>between cohorts. We additionally assessed inter-study heterogeneity and influence of individual <lb/>cohorts by observing forest plots and heterogeneity statistics, as well as conducting a &quot;leave-one-<lb/>out&quot; analysis using the metafor R package [51]. We checked consistency between models by <lb/>comparing effect estimates and top hits to those of our primary model. We also compared top hits <lb/>to a list of probes suggested to give spurious readings due to cross-hybridisation or genomic features <lb/>such as nearby SNPs [52]. When a cord blood reference became available [53], we ran a sensitivity <lb/>analysis in ALSPAC adjusting for estimated proportions of B-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, <lb/>granulocytes, NK-cells, monocytes and nucleated red blood cells. <lb/>Comparison to associations between FASD and buccal epithelial DNA methylation in <lb/>children <lb/>We performed a look-up in our results of the top CpGs and differentially methylated regions (FDR-<lb/>adjusted P-value&lt;0.05, n CpGs = 658) reported in a study by Portales-Casamar et al. [31], which <lb/>analysed epigenome-wide buccal epithelial cell DNA methylation in children with FASD compared to <lb/>controls. We compared direction of effect and p-values across the two studies. <lb/>Comparison to associations between light-to-moderate drinking and whole blood <lb/>DNA methylation in adults <lb/>We performed a second look-up in our results of the top CpGs (FDR-adjusted P-value&lt;0.05) from a <lb/>study by Liu et al. [32], which meta-analysed associations between alcohol consumption and <lb/>epigenome-wide whole blood DNA methylation in adults (CHARGE consortium). In order to <lb/>harmonise with our models, we restricted the look-up to the top CpGs from the previous study&apos;s <lb/>models that assessed light drinking (3 CpGs) and moderate drinking (24 CpGs), versus no drinking <lb/>(results supplied by the study authors). As with our first look-up, we compared direction of effect <lb/>and p-values across the two studies. <lb/>Differentially methylated regions analysis <lb/>Adjacent probes on the 450k array are often highly correlated and differentially methylated regions <lb/>(DMRs) may be more biologically important than individual CpGs. Therefore, we used two methods, <lb/>Comb-P [54] and DMRcate [55], to identify DMRs in our meta-analysed single-CpG EWAS results. <lb/>Comb-P identifies genomic regions enriched for low P-values, corrects for auto-correlation with <lb/>neighbouring CpGs within 1000 bp using the Stouffer-Liptak method, then adjusts for multiple <lb/>testing using <lb/>the <lb/>Sidak <lb/>correction. <lb/>DMRcate <lb/>generates <lb/>two <lb/>smoothed <lb/>estimates <lb/>for <lb/>each <lb/>chromosome: <lb/>one <lb/>weighted <lb/>by <lb/>F-statistics <lb/>(calculated <lb/>from <lb/>the <lb/>meta-analysis <lb/>results <lb/>as <lb/>(beta/standard error) <lb/>2 <lb/>) and one not, for null comparison. The two estimates are compared via a <lb/>Satterthwaite approximation and P-values are calculated and adjusted for multiple testing using the <lb/>FDR method. Regions are defined from groups of significant probes (FDR&lt;0.05) where the distance <lb/>to the next consecutive probe is less than 1000 bp. A regional P-value is calculated using the Stouffer <lb/>method. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the Comb-P and DMRcate analyses using a 500 bp <lb/>(rather than 1000 bp) window to define neighbouring CpGs. <lb/>Blood/Brain comparison <lb/>To assess whether identified associations between prenatal alcohol exposure and cord blood <lb/>methylation are likely to represent associations in a more biologically-relevant tissue (the brain), we <lb/>performed a look-up of CpG sites in a database of correlations between blood and brain methylation <lb/>(http://epigenetics.iop.kcl.ac.uk/bloodbrain/). Methods used to derive this database are described <lb/>elsewhere [56], but briefly, the authors quantified DNA methylation in matched DNA samples from <lb/>whole blood and four brain regions (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus <lb/>and cerebellum) from 122 individuals. <lb/>Results <lb/>Study characteristics <lb/>Of the six participating cohorts, Project Viva and GECKO could not take part in all meta-analyses due <lb/>to insufficient data/number of exposed individuals. Project Viva were therefore only included in the <lb/>analysis of drinking before pregnancy compared to abstaining. GECKO were included in the primary <lb/>analysis assessing sustained alcohol consumption, and the secondary analysis assessing binge <lb/>drinking. The other cohorts (ALSPAC, Generation R, MoBa1 and MoBa2) were included in all <lb/>analyses. <lb/>Five cohorts (ALSPAC, GECKO, Generation R, MoBa1, MoBa2) had the necessary data to take part in <lb/>our primary analysis of sustained alcohol consumption in pregnancy. The meta-analysis included <lb/>3,075 mother-child pairs, of which 1,147 (37.3%) mothers consumed alcohol both before and <lb/>throughout pregnancy and the remaining 1,928 mothers consumed alcohol before pregnancy/during <lb/>the first trimester but not during the second and/or third trimester. Table 1 summarizes the <lb/>characteristics of each cohort. In all investigated cohorts, women who drank throughout pregnancy <lb/>were, on average, older and had a higher level of education than women who stopped. In MoBa2 <lb/>and GECKO women who drank throughout pregnancy were less likely to smoke throughout <lb/>pregnancy compared to women who stopped drinking, but the opposite was true for the other three <lb/>studies. <lb/>Primary models: sustained maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy <lb/>
			For both the cell-adjusted and cell-unadjusted models, effect sizes were moderate: for top CpGs <lb/>with P-value&lt;1*10 <lb/>-3 <lb/>, estimates ranged from a 4% decrease to 2% increase in average methylation <lb/>level in the exposed compared to the unexposed group, with a median absolute estimate of 0.4% <lb/>(File S2, Table S1 and S2). No CpG sites survived correction for multiple testing with an FDR-adjusted <lb/>P-value&lt;0.05 (Figure 1). There was little evidence of inflation, as assessed by the lambda value (Table <lb/>1). Results for all sites with a P-value&lt;1*10 <lb/>-3 <lb/>are presented in File S2 Table S1 and S2. Of the 622 and <lb/>797 CpGs with P-value&lt;1*10 <lb/>-3 <lb/>in the cell-unadjusted and cell-adjusted models, respectively, 500 had <lb/>a P-value&lt;1*10 <lb/>-3 <lb/>according to both models. Adjusting for estimated cell counts appeared to have <lb/>little effect: at the 500 top sites, the median percentage difference in effect sizes before and after <lb/>adjustment was 3.4% and only 26/500 sites changed by 10% or more. At exactly half of the 500 top <lb/>sites, adjusting for cell counts reduced the effect size towards the null. At the remaining 250 sites <lb/>the effect size increased after cell-adjustment. Adjusting for cell counts increased the standard error <lb/>at 357/500 sites. <lb/>Secondary models <lb/>With and without adjustment for cell counts, no individual CpG sites were associated with drinking <lb/>before pregnancy or during the first trimester after FDR correction for multiple testing. One CpG <lb/>(cg12509712 near ARSG) was associated with binge drinking, but only after adjustment for cell <lb/>counts. In addition, one CpG (cg20334115 near PYCR2) was associated with drinking in the second <lb/>and/or third trimester, but only before adjustment for cell counts. We did not consider these <lb/>individual sites further due to the lack of consistency between the cell-adjusted and cell-unadjusted <lb/>models. Results for all sites with a P-value&lt;1*10 <lb/>-3 <lb/>are presented in File S2 Table S3-S10. <lb/>Sensitivity analyses <lb/>There was evidence of heterogeneity at a minority of the top 500 sites associated with sustained <lb/>maternal alcohol consumption: 100/500 sites had a heterogeneity P-value&lt;0.05; I <lb/>2 <lb/>was &gt;40 at <lb/>36/500. After running a random effects meta-analysis at the top 500, the coefficients for 88/500 <lb/>changed &gt;10% compared to coefficients generated using the fixed effects meta-analysis. Forest plots <lb/>and <lb/>results <lb/>of <lb/>a <lb/>leave-one-out <lb/>analysis <lb/>(File <lb/>S3) <lb/>suggested <lb/>that <lb/>no <lb/>single <lb/>cohort <lb/>had <lb/>a <lb/>disproportionately large influence on the meta-analysis results consistently over all 500 sites. <lb/>Of the top 500 sites, 164 were on a published list of possibly problematic probes [52] (File S2 Table <lb/>S1 and S2). Although these sites may be more likely to contain outliers, cohorts removed outlier <lb/>values prior to EWAS and used a regression model that is designed to be robust to outliers in the <lb/>outcome variable. <lb/>The direction of effect in our primary model (sustained maternal alcohol consumption during <lb/>pregnancy) was mostly consistent with results from our other models (Figure 2). As is expected given <lb/>their similarity, results from the model assessing maternal alcohol consumption in the second/third <lb/>trimester were particularly consistent with results from the primary model (Spearman&apos;s correlation <lb/>coefficient for regression coefficients at all probes: 0.76 for the cell-adjusted models and 0.74 for the <lb/>cell-unadjusted models). Results for all sites with a P-value&lt;1*10-3 are presented in File S2 Table S1-<lb/>S10 and lambdas and number of hits per cohort are provided in File S2 Table S11. <lb/>In ALSPAC, adjusting for cell counts estimated using the adult whole blood reference panel provided <lb/>similar EWAS results to those obtained when adjusting for cell counts estimated using a cord blood <lb/>reference panel: at the top 500 sites from the primary meta-analysis, the median percentage change <lb/>in coefficients in ALSPAC was 7% (IQR 3% to 14%), with 317/500 sites changing less than 10%. Of the <lb/>top 500 sites, 219 had a crude P-value &lt;0.05 in ALSPAC when using the adult reference, and 197/219 <lb/>(90%) also had a crude P-value &lt;0.05 when using the cord blood reference. <lb/>Comparison to associations between FASD and buccal epithelial DNA methylation in <lb/>children <lb/>Of 658 CpG sites at which DNA methylation in buccal cells was associated with FASD according to <lb/>Portales-Casamar et al., 288 (44%) had the same direction of association (regardless of P-value) in <lb/>our study of maternal sustained drinking, but none survived correction for multiple testing at 658 <lb/>sites (FDR-adjusted P-value&lt;0.05). Of 542 CpG sites within 101 FASD-associated DMRs (identified <lb/>using DMRcate), 215 (40%) had the same direction of association in our study of maternal sustained <lb/>drinking, but none survived correction for multiple testing at 542 sites (FDR-adjusted P-value&lt;0.05). <lb/>Full look-up results for all PACE models are provided in File S2 Table S12. <lb/>Comparison to associations between light/moderate drinking and whole blood DNA <lb/>methylation in adults <lb/>Of 24 CpGs associated (FDR-adjusted P&lt;0.05) with adult moderate drinking in the study by Liu et al. <lb/>[32], one was associated with maternal sustained drinking in our PACE analysis after correction for <lb/>multiple testing at 24 sites (FDR-adjusted P&lt;0.05). At this site, the direction of the effect of maternal <lb/>drinking on methylation was inverse compared to the effect of own drinking: cg19909613; closest <lb/>gene TTC35; PACE effect 0.0075 P-value 1.7*10 -3 <lb/>; Liu et al. effect -0.014 P-value 9.2*10 -7 <lb/>. In the cell-<lb/>adjusted model, this site did not survive FDR correction. None of the three CpG sites that were <lb/>associated with light drinking according to Liu et al. were associated with maternal sustained <lb/>drinking in the PACE study. Full look-up results for all PACE models are provided in File S2 Table S13. <lb/>Differentially methylated region analysis <lb/>Using Comb-P to conduct a region-based analysis based on spatial correlation of p-values, we <lb/>identified 30 and 32 DMRs in the cell-unadjusted and cell-adjusted maternal sustained drinking <lb/>models, <lb/>respectively <lb/>(Sidak-corrected <lb/>P-value <lb/>&lt;0.05). <lb/>Nineteen <lb/>regions <lb/>were <lb/>differentially <lb/>methylated according to both models (Table 2; results for all models shown in File S2 Table S14). <lb/>However, we found no DMRs when we conducted the region-based analysis using DMRcate. <lb/>Defining DMRs using a 500bp (as opposed to 1000bp) window did not change our results using <lb/>either Comb-P or DMRcate. <lb/>Blood/brain comparison <lb/>CpGs within the 19 sustained drinking DMRs identified using Comb-P tended to show strong <lb/>correlations between blood and brain methylation. For example, at the top CpG with the smallest <lb/>EWAS P-value within the top DMR with the smallest SIDAK-corrected P-value (cg26320663, DMR <lb/>Chr1:152161237-152162026 near HRNR) correlation coefficients between blood and brain ranged <lb/>from 0.61 in the cerebellum and entorhhinal cortex to 0.66 in the pre-frontal cortex (P-values <lb/>ranging 1.8*10 <lb/>-8 <lb/>to 1.5*10 <lb/>-10 <lb/>). All results are presented in File S2 Table S15. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We combined data across five pregnancy cohorts to evaluate associations between maternal alcohol <lb/>consumption during pregnancy and genome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood of offspring. <lb/>Although we did not find any consistent evidence of association between any category of prenatal <lb/>alcohol exposure, defined in terms of dose and timing, and single-site methylation, we found some <lb/>evidence that 19 larger regions of the genome were differentially methylated in association with <lb/>sustained maternal alcohol consumption throughout pregnancy (i.e. when comparing mothers who <lb/>drank throughout pregnancy to those who stopped at the beginning or after the first trimester). <lb/>However, optimal methods for regional analyses are currently a matter of debate and we were not <lb/>able to validate this finding using a different region-based method, so we conclude that we have not <lb/>found any strong evidence for an association. <lb/>The only previously published study on methylation effects of prenatal alcohol exposure was <lb/>reported by Portales-Casamar et al., who compared buccal cells from children with and without <lb/>FASD in a small sample with just over 100 cases [31]. At the CpGs that Portales-Casamar et al. <lb/>identified as associated with FASD, less than half showed the same direction of association with <lb/>sustained maternal alcohol consumption in our study, and none survived correction for multiple <lb/>testing. This is perhaps not surprising given the stark methodological differences between the two <lb/>studies: Firstly, DNA methylation is strongly tissue-specific [57], so DNA from buccal cells (Portales-<lb/>Casamar et al.) and cord blood (our study) are perhaps unlikely to show the same general <lb/>methylation patterns. Secondly, DNA methylation is strongly influenced by age [58] and could be <lb/>affected by many factors in the postnatal environment that are associated with prenatal alcohol <lb/>exposure (such as maternal education and childhood adversity) -both of these factors are important <lb/>to consider when interpreting results from our study, where methylation was measured at birth, <lb/>compared to the study by Portales-Casamar et al., where participants were around 11-years-old. <lb/>Thirdly, the prospective cohort design of the studies included in our meta-analysis meant that we <lb/>were able to adjust for measured confounders and participants were sampled from the same <lb/>populations. <lb/>Portales-Casamar et al.&apos;s case-control study of 11-year-olds is more open to <lb/>confounding (especially by the postnatal environment, as mentioned above). In particular, the cases <lb/>and controls differed with respect to important sociodemographic characteristics (namely, ethnicity <lb/>and being raised by adoptive/foster parents) that have previously been associated with variation in <lb/>DNA methylation [59-61]. Fourthly, the FASD case-control comparison likely covers a larger range of <lb/>exposure (i.e. cases were exposed to much higher intensity of exposure in utero; controls were likely <lb/>to have been exposed to less alcohol) than our study of differential prenatal exposure to alcohol in <lb/>the general population. This is supported by previous population-based studies showing that women <lb/>who drink during pregnancy tend to do so at light-to-moderate levels, especially those that continue <lb/>to drink after pregnancy detection [6]. Fifthly, this difference in level of alcohol exposure in both <lb/>studies means there are different confounding structures, for example, in Portales-Casamar et al. <lb/>higher exposure was associated with lower socioeconomic status, whereas, in our study, higher <lb/>exposure was associated with higher maternal education in all investigated cohorts. <lb/>We were interested in whether exposure to alcohol prenatally is associated with DNA methylation at <lb/>the same CpG sites as exposure to alcohol during adulthood. Therefore, we performed a look-up of <lb/>results from a study recently published by Liu et al., which found some evidence of associations <lb/>
			between DNA methylation and varying levels of alcohol consumption in an adult population [32]. At <lb/>the CpGs that were associated with light or moderate drinking in Liu et al., we did not find any <lb/>strong evidence of an association with prenatal exposure. This lack of overlap might be explained by <lb/>maternal alcohol consumption affecting fetal DNA methylation differently than adult methylation. It <lb/>could also be related to differences in population age, definitions, range and duration of exposure, <lb/>and potential differences in accuracy of self-report in non-pregnant and pregnant adults leading to <lb/>differences in measurement error. <lb/>Although we did not find strong evidence for an association between alcohol consumption during <lb/>pregnancy and genome-wide DNA methylation in offspring cord blood in the general population, this <lb/>does not exclude the possibility that such an association does exist in a different tissue. For example, <lb/>brain tissue may be a more appropriate tissue to study because some of the strongest evidence from <lb/>observational studies suggests an association between prenatal alcohol exposure and impaired <lb/>neurodevelopmental outcomes [62]. There are obvious ethical issues that preclude collection of <lb/>brain tissue in population-based studies, however, there are reasons to believe that DNA <lb/>methylation in blood may be a good surrogate for DNA methylation in brain at some sites. Strong <lb/>correlations in blood and brain DNA methylation have been found at some CpGs [56,63], including at <lb/>our top DMR from the Comb-P analysis. Although we were not able to replicate our Comb-P DMRs <lb/>using a different method (DMRcate), the high correlation between some of these regions in blood <lb/>and brain mean they may serve as interesting candidate genes for further studies of the role of DNA <lb/>methylation as a mediator of associations between prenatal alcohol exposure and offspring <lb/>neurodevelopmental outcomes. Alternatively, the high correlations between blood and brain <lb/>methylation at these sites might represent a genetic influence on methylation that is also associated <lb/>with maternal alcohol consumption. Regardless of causality, methylation at these regions might be a <lb/>useful biomarker for prenatal alcohol exposure [64], thereby serving as a more objective measure <lb/>than self-report. This possibility would have to be validated and tested in independent datasets. <lb/>Strengths of our study include the use of data from six well-characterised and established cohorts. <lb/>The prospective data available from these cohorts has allowed us to investigate the timing and <lb/>strength of exposure, including binge-drinking and exposure by trimester, and to minimise <lb/>measurement error and recall bias. Previous studies from the PACE consortium have used a similar <lb/>methodology to prescribe cohort-specific analyses and to meta-analyse results from several cohorts. <lb/>These studies identified many, seemingly robust, associations [22,65]. This suggests that the lack of <lb/>associations identified in our study is not likely due to poor methodology or data. <lb/>Failure to observe associations between maternal alcohol consumption and cord blood DNA <lb/>methylation could be due to lack of statistical power, particularly if we hypothesise a dose-response <lb/>association such that low levels of exposure correspond to small methylation differences. As most <lb/>pregnant women in our cohorts did not drink excessive amounts of alcohol, a large sample size <lb/>would be required to detect a small epigenetic effect. A further potential limitation of our study is <lb/>that there was some inter-cohort heterogeneity, perhaps caused by differences in confounding <lb/>structures (we note that in some studies women who drank throughout pregnancy were more likely <lb/>to be smokers, while in others the opposite was true), definition and range of alcohol exposure, <lb/>and/or different methods of normalizing DNA methylation data. Encouragingly though, our meta-<lb/>analysis results were not substantially different when we used a random-effects model compared to <lb/>a fixed-effects model. Furthermore, forest plots and results of a leave-one-out analysis suggested <lb/>our <lb/>meta-analysis <lb/>results <lb/>were <lb/>not <lb/>strongly <lb/>influenced <lb/>by <lb/>differences <lb/>between <lb/>studies. <lb/>Measurement error could also reduce statistical power and this may be a particular problem for <lb/>studies of maternal alcohol consumption: pregnant women may under-report behaviours that are <lb/>widely thought to be harmful for their baby [66]. Cellular heterogeneity in cord blood samples is a <lb/>further issue [67] that may introduce error in our measure of DNA methylation. Blood samples are <lb/>highly heterogeneous and although we have attempted to adjust for cellular heterogeneity by <lb/>including estimated cell proportions in our EWAS models, no suitable cord blood reference was <lb/>widely available at the time of analysis, so these estimates were based on an adult blood reference <lb/>panel. When a cord blood reference became available [53], a sensitivity analysis in ALSPAC did not <lb/>reveal sizable differences between EWAS results adjusted for cell proportions estimated using either <lb/>the cord or adult reference panel. However, we recognise that there may be a residual influence of <lb/>cellular heterogeneity that could be biasing the results in either direction. Another factor that could <lb/>be biasing results is circulating folate levels, which we could not formally evaluate because not all <lb/>cohorts had the required data. However, there are two reasons why folate is likely to play at most a <lb/>marginal role in our findings. Firstly, we found low inter-study heterogeneity for most of our CpG <lb/>sites -if there was a prominent interaction between alcohol (a folate antagonist) and folate (a <lb/>methyl donor), then we might expect more heterogeneity due to country-and timing-specific <lb/>differences in folate intake. Secondly, our results were largely null -confounding by folic acid <lb/>supplementation, which is indirectly associated with alcohol consumption [14,68], is unlikely to be <lb/>exaggerating estimates of the association between maternal alcohol and offspring methylation. We <lb/>also consider that some of our findings may be affected by selection bias: women who are actively <lb/>trying to get pregnant may abstain from drinking alcohol, but these women were excluded from our <lb/>analyses of sustained and binge drinking. However, these women were not excluded from our <lb/>analyses of other alcohol exposures (before pregnancy, first trimester, second and third trimester) <lb/>and our findings were consistently null across all alcohol exposures. A final potential limitation is <lb/>that the Illumina HumanMethylation450k array covers only 1.7% of all CpG sites in the human <lb/>genome, which may not cover potential regions where maternal alcohol consumption is most <lb/>strongly associated with offspring methylation. The development of sequence-based approaches <lb/>methods with better genomic coverage will help overcome this limitation in future studies. <lb/>If an association between maternal alcohol consumption and cord blood DNA methylation does exist <lb/>(for example, in larger samples and/or different populations with a greater range of alcohol <lb/>exposure), then future studies should explore whether that association is causal or confounded by <lb/>genetics or shared mother-child environmental factors. For example, paternal alcohol consumption <lb/>could be employed as a &apos;negative control&apos; that will share the same confounding structure as <lb/>maternal alcohol consumption but cannot plausibly affect offspring DNA methylation through a <lb/>direct causal intrauterine mechanism [69]. Techniques such as two-step Mendelian randomization <lb/>[70] could also be applied to explore 1) the causal effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on DNA <lb/>methylation and 2) the causal effect of DNA methylation on offspring outcomes. Even if the <lb/>association is not causal, newborn blood DNA methylation might capture both genetic and <lb/>environmental influences of maternal alcohol consumption, which could be useful, both clinically <lb/>and in research, as a biomarker of exposure and/or a useful predictor of offspring outcomes. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>In this multi-cohort study, we found no evidence that maternal alcohol consumption during <lb/>pregnancy is associated with offspring cord blood DNA methylation in the general population. <lb/>However, it is possible that a combination of higher doses and different timings of exposure, as well <lb/>as a more global assessment of genomic DNA methylation, might show evidence of association. We <lb/>therefore recommend caution when interpreting the present null findings and encourage further <lb/>investigations. <lb/></body>
