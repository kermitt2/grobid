Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for <lb/>SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 <lb/>expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by <lb/>attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal <lb/>inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and <lb/>ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control <lb/>subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 <lb/>expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, <lb/>innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein <lb/>translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we <lb/>suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-<lb/>nCoV infection. <lb/></front>

			<body>route for 2019-nCoV infection. One (3%) of the first 41 reported cases had diarrhea [1]. In <lb/>another report describing a familial cluster, 2 of the 6 family members (33%) developed <lb/>diarrhea[2]. Furthermore, positive 2019-nCoV was detected from the stools of a patient with <lb/>loose of bowel movement in the United States [3]. <lb/>There have been many studies on the proteins associated with host entry by the SARS-CoV. <lb/>Cleavage of Spike protein by tissue factor Xa is required for the infectivity of SARS-CoV [4]. <lb/>Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant used to combat acute pulmonary embolism with or without <lb/>deep-vein thrombosis [5]. As an Xa inhibitor, it may thus offer protection for 2019-nCoV <lb/>pneumonia. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor [6]. It also <lb/>has been linked to 2019-nCoV infection; ACE2 interacts with the Spike protein and mediates <lb/>2019-nCoV infection of the type II alveolar cells of the lung [7]. <lb/>Paradoxically, although ACE2 mediates viral entry to the host, its deficiency worsens lung injury <lb/>by activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in experimental models [6]. The circulating <lb/>RAS regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Local tissue-based RAS exacerbates <lb/>pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury and experimental lung fibrosis [8]. Thus, blocking of <lb/>the Angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1R) was associated with reduced SARS-CoV spike protein <lb/>mediated lung injury [6] and reduced pulmonary hypertension in experimental models [9]. The <lb/>AT1R blocker valsartan has recently been reported to improve clinical outcomes for patients <lb/>with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated with pulmonary hypertension <lb/>(DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.PA2469). In the PARADIGM-HF trial, valsartan and the <lb/></body>

			<body>neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril (Valsartan/sacubitril, branded Entresto by Novartis) also <lb/>significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization for patients with heart failure [10]. <lb/>Apart from the lung, ACE2 is also associated with gut function. ACE2 expression in the gut <lb/>epithelial cells is required for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide <lb/>expression and the ecology of gut microbiome in the intestine [11, 12]. We had previously <lb/>generated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from control subjects and those with colitis or <lb/>IBD [13]. Using this dataset, we examined ACE2 expression and found that it was specifically <lb/>and highly expressed by the colonocytes (Figure 1 A-B). Compared with other epithelial <lb/>subtypes, colonocytes overexpressed genes regulating viral entry, budding and releasing from the <lb/>host cells (VAPA, CHMP4C, CHMP1A, CHMP2B, CHMP4B, CHMP1B, VPS37B, PDCD6IP, <lb/>VPS4B, CHMP3, VPS28, CHMP2A, PVRL2, CDH1, and MVB12A). Genes involved in nucleic <lb/>acid sensing and type I, type III interferon signaling (R2RX4, DDX58, NLRC5, IFNAR2, IFNGR1 <lb/>and IFNGR2), pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine (IL18, IL32, CXCL16, CXCL3, CXCL2, <lb/>CXCL1, CCL28, CCL20) production, antigen presentation via MHC class I molecules (HLA-A, <lb/>HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-E) and cytokine receptors (IL2G, IL10RB, and IL6R) were also <lb/>enriched in colonocytes (Figure 1C). <lb/>Given that ACE2 plays dual roles in mediating viral entry and preventing tissue injury [6, 11, 12, <lb/>14], we analyzed genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells. In total, <lb/>3420 and 2136 genes were positively and negatively correlated with ACE2 expression, <lb/>respectively (Supplementary table 1 and Figure 2A). In Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, genes <lb/>positively correlated with ACE2 expression were enriched in viral infection and egress (viral <lb/></body>

In contrast, genes negatively correlated with ACE2 were <lb/>enriched for humoral immunity (positive regulation of B cell activation, antibacterial humoral <lb/>response, mature B cell differentiation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, immunoglobulin <lb/>production), protein translation (ribosomal big and small subunit assembly and translational <lb/>initiation), phagocytosis (Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway, Fc-gamma receptor signaling <lb/>pathway involved in phagocytosis, phagocytosis recognition) and classical pathway of <lb/>complement activation (Figure 2B). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Here we report the expression pattern of ACE2 in the human intestine at single-cell resolution. <lb/>Our data suggest that ACE2 is specifically expressed by colonocytes and positively associated <lb/>with viral entry and egress, consistent with observations that the gastrointestinal tract is a <lb/>potential route for 2019-nCoV infection. In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression <lb/>prevents intestinal inflammation [11, 12], bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating <lb/>type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism <lb/>are positively associated with ACE2 expression.

			<body>and complement activation are negatively associated with ACE2 expression. These findings may <lb/>facilitate concurrent and future investigations of the nature and function of the immune system at <lb/>systemic and local levels in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. <lb/>Notably, SARS-CoV spike protein engagement downregulates ACE2 expression and activates <lb/>the RAS [6]. Given that hypertension is common in severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia [1], it is <lb/>highly likely that the RAS is activated in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia. The Xa <lb/>inhibitor Rivaroxaban [5] and the AT1R blocker valsartan (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress-<lb/>2019.PA2469) are effective in relieving pulmonary injury and embolism in experimental models <lb/>and clinical trials, their efficacy in treating 2019-nCoV may worth consideration. Dipyridamole <lb/>is another anti-coagulation drug. In a pilot trial, dipyridamole administration promoted mucosal <lb/>healing and improved clinical symptoms in patients with colitis or IBD [13]. More importantly, <lb/>published clinical studies [15-20], including those conducted in China (DOI: <lb/>CNKI:SUN:XIYI.0.2010-12-026;[21]; CNKI:SUN:YXLT.0.2014-32-031), have demonstrated <lb/>that dipyridamole has broad spectrum antiviral activity against virus infections.
