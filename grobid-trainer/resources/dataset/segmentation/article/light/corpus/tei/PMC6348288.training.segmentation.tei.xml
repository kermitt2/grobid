The data for effective diameter and zeta potential was gen-<lb/>erated using the particle size analyser and zeta potential analyser <lb/>respectively. The measured data for effective diameter and zeta <lb/>potential was processed to generate the data for sedimentation <lb/>velocity and stability factor. The ultra-sonication time with max-<lb/>imum value of stability factor was used for sample preparation of <lb/>Cu/Al 2 O 3 single particle nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid in the <lb/>related research article &quot;On trade-off for dispersion stability and <lb/>thermal transport of Cu-Al 2 O 3 hybrid nanofluid for various mixing <lb/>ratios&quot; (Siddiqui et al., 2019) [1]. <lb/>&amp; 2019 The Authors.

A thick paste was prepared by adding 3 drops (50 ml each) of deionized <lb/>(DI) water in a 4 ml glass vial containing nanoparticles. <lb/>2. The thick paste was diluted with DI water up to 4 ml volume, transferred <lb/>to a 500 ml glass bottle and further diluted with DI water up to 10 ml <lb/>volume to obtain a 0.01% volume fraction for ultra-sonication. <lb/>3. Samples were sonicated in ultra-sonication bath at fixed frequency and <lb/>power of 40 kHz and 130 W respectively. <lb/>Experimental features <lb/>1.

Heat Mass Transf. 132 (2019) 1200-1216, [1] <lb/>Value of the data <lb/>The data comprises the critical parameters of dispersion stability such as the effective diameter, <lb/>zeta potential and sedimentation velocity for different ultra-sonication times. <lb/>The data can be used to develop an ultra-sonication time optimization model to achieve a uniform <lb/>and homogenous particle dispersion. <lb/>The data can be used as a reference material to further investigate the ultra-sonication time based <lb/>dispersion stability for other nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid samples. <lb/>1. Data <lb/>The data on particle effective diameter (∅), zeta potential (ζÞ, sedimentation velocity ðV s Þ and <lb/>stability factor (SF) for Cu/Al 2 O 3 single particle nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid samples at various <lb/>ultra-sonication times (t) is presented in Table 1. The details on sedimentation velocity and various <lb/>mixing ratios of hybrid nanofluid (MR-1, MR-2 and MR-3) samples are reported in the related <lb/>research article [1]. The data on scaling factor (S ζ ) as shown in Table 1 was processed from the <lb/>measured data on zeta potential (S ζ ¼ 0:01665ζ). The data in Table 1 shows that the ultra-sonication <lb/>time with maximum stability factor is 2.0 h for both Al 2 O 3 nanofluid and MR-1 hybrid nanofluid and <lb/>0.5 h for both MR-2 and MR-3 hybrid nanofluids. Stability factor for Cu nanofluid is not presented in <lb/>Table 1 due to the lack of data on effective diameter as it was above the measuring range of the <lb/>particle size analyser. <lb/></body>
