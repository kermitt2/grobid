			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>In recent years, conditional logic has come to play a major <lb/>role as an underlying foundation for default reasoning. Two <lb/>of the more successful default reasoning systems (Geffner <lb/>1992; Goldszmidt, Morris, &amp; Pearl 1993) are based on con-<lb/>ditional logic. Unfortunately, while it has long been rec-<lb/>ognized that first-order expressive power is necessary for a <lb/>default reasoning system, most of the work on conditional <lb/>logic has been restricted to the propositional case. In this <lb/>paper, we investigate the syntax and semantics of first-order <lb/>conditional logic, with the ultimate goal of providing a first-<lb/>order default reasoning system. <lb/>Many seemingly different approaches have been pro-<lb/>posed for giving semantics to conditional logic, including <lb/>preferential structures (Lewis 1973; Boutilier 1994; Kraus, <lb/>Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990), -semantics (Adams 1975; <lb/>Pearl 1989), possibility theory (Benferhat, Dubois, &amp; Prade <lb/>1992), and ¡ -rankings (Spohn 1987; Goldszmidt &amp; Pearl <lb/>1992). In preferential structures, for example, a model con-<lb/>sists of a set of possible worlds, ordered by a preference <lb/>ordering ¢ . If £ ¤¢ ¥£ ¦ <lb/>, then the world £ is strictly more <lb/>preferred/more normal than £ ¦ <lb/>. The formula Bird § Fly <lb/>holds if in the most preferred worlds in which Bird holds, <lb/>Fly also holds. (See Section 2 for more details about this <lb/>and the other approaches.) <lb/>The extension of these approaches to the first-order case <lb/>seems deceptively easy. After all, we can simply have <lb/>a preferential ordering on first-order, rather than proposi-<lb/>tional, worlds. However, there is a subtlety here. As in <lb/>the case of first-order probabilistic logic (Bacchus 1990; <lb/>Halpern 1990), there are two distinct ways to define condi-<lb/>tionals in the first-order case. In the probabilistic case, the <lb/>first corresponds to (objective) statistical statements, such <lb/>as &quot;90% of birds fly&quot;. The second corresponds to subjec-<lb/>tive degree of belief statements, such as &quot;the probability that <lb/>Tweety (a particular bird) flies is 0.9&quot;. The first is captured <lb/>by putting a probability distribution over the domain (so that <lb/>the probability of the set of flying birds is 0.9 that of the set <lb/>of birds), while the second is captured by putting a proba-<lb/>bility on the set of possible worlds (so that the probability <lb/>of the set of worlds where Tweety flies is 0.9 that of the set <lb/>of worlds where Tweety is a bird). The same phenomenon <lb/>occurs in the case of first-order conditional logic. Here, <lb/>we can have a measure (e.g., a preferential ranking) over <lb/>the domain, or a measure over the set of possible worlds. <lb/>The first would allow us to capture qualitative statistical <lb/>statements such as &quot;most birds fly&quot;, while the second would <lb/>allow us to capture subjective beliefs such as &quot;I believe that <lb/>the bird Tweety is likely to fly&quot;. It is important to have a <lb/>language that allows us to distinguish between these two <lb/>very different statements. Having distinguished between <lb/>these two types of conditionals, we can ascribe semantics <lb/>to each of them using any one of the standard approaches. <lb/>There have been previous attempts to formalize first-<lb/>order conditional logic; some are the natural exten-<lb/>sion of some propositional formalism (Delgrande 1987; <lb/>Brafman 1991), while others use alternative approaches <lb/>(Lehmann &amp; Magidor 1990; Schlechta 1995). (We defer <lb/>a detailed discussion of these approaches to the full paper; <lb/>see also Section 5.) How do we make sense of this plethora <lb/>of alternatives? Rather than investigating them separately, <lb/>we use a single common framework that generalizes almost <lb/>all of them. This framework uses a notion of uncertainty <lb/>called a plausibility measure, introduced by Friedman and <lb/>Halpern ¨(1995). A plausibility measure associates with set <lb/>of worlds its plausibility, which is just an element in a par-<lb/>tially ordered space. Probability measures are a subclass of <lb/>plausibility measures, in which the plausibilities lie in © 0 1 , <lb/>with the standard ordering. In (Friedman &amp; Halpern 1996), <lb/>it is shown that the different standard approaches to condi-<lb/>tional logic can all be mapped to plausibility measures, if we <lb/>interpret Bird § Fly as &quot;the set of worlds where Bird Fly <lb/>holds has greater plausibility than that of the set of worlds <lb/>where Bird Fly holds&quot;. <lb/>The existence of a single unifying framework has al-<lb/>ready proved to be very useful in the case of propositional <lb/>conditional logic. In particular, it allowed Friedman and <lb/>Halpern (1996) to explain the intriguing &quot;coincidence&quot; that <lb/>all of the different approaches to conditional logic result in <lb/>an identical reasoning system, characterized by the KLM <lb/>axioms (Kraus, Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990). In this paper, <lb/>we show that plausibility spaces can also be used to clarify <lb/>the semantics of first-order conditional logic. However, we <lb/>show that, unlike the propositional case, the different ap-<lb/>proaches lead to different properties in the first-order case. <lb/>Intuitively, these are infinitary properties that require quan-<lb/>tifiers and therefore cannot be expressed in a propositional <lb/>language. We show that, in some sense, plausibilities pro-<lb/>vide the most natural extension of conditional logic to the <lb/>first-order case. We provide a sound and complete axioma-<lb/>tization for the subjective fragment of conditional logic that <lb/>contains only the KLM properties and the standard axioms <lb/>of first-order modal logic. 1 (We provide a similar axiom-<lb/>atization for the statistical fragment of the language in the <lb/>full paper.) Essentially the same axiomatization is shown <lb/>to be sound and complete for the first-order version of -<lb/>semantics, but the other approaches are shown to satisfy <lb/>additional properties. <lb/>One might think that it is not so bad for a conditional logic <lb/>to satisfy additional properties. After all, there are some <lb/>properties-such as indifference to irrelevant information-<lb/>that we would like to be able to get. Unfortunately, the ad-<lb/>ditional properties that we get from using these approaches <lb/>are not the ones we want. The properties we get are re-<lb/>lated to the treatment of exceptional individuals. This issue <lb/>is perhaps best illustrated by the lottery paradox (Kyburg <lb/>1961). 2 Suppose we believe about a lottery that any partic-<lb/>ular individual typically does not win the lottery. Thus we <lb/>get <lb/>true § ¥ Winner &quot;! #! %$ <lb/>1 ! <lb/>However, we believe that typically someone does win the <lb/>lottery, that is <lb/>true § &apos;&amp; <lb/>Winner ( )! 0$ <lb/>2 ! <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 By way of contrast, there is no (recursively enumerable) ax-<lb/>iomatization of first-order probabilistic logic (Halpern 1990). <lb/>2 We are referring to Kyburg&apos;s original version of the lottery <lb/>paradox (Kyburg 1961), and not to the finitary version discussed <lb/>by Poole (1991). As Poole showed, any logic of defaults that <lb/>satisfies certain minimal properties-properties which are satisfied <lb/>by all the logics we consider-is bound to suffer from his version <lb/>of the lottery paradox. <lb/></note>

			<body>Unfortunately, in many of the standard approaches, such as <lb/>Delgrande&apos;s (1987) version of first-order preferential struc-<lb/>tures, from (1) we can conclude <lb/>true § 1 Winner &quot;! #! 0$ <lb/>3 ! <lb/>Intuitively, from (1) it follows that in the most preferred <lb/>worlds, each individual 2 does not win the lottery. There-<lb/>fore, in the most preferred worlds, no individual wins. This <lb/>is exactly what (3) says. Since (2) says that in the most pre-<lb/>ferred worlds, some individual wins, it follows that there <lb/>are no most preferred worlds, i.e., we have true § false. <lb/>While this may be consistent (as it is in Delgrande&apos;s logic), <lb/>it implies that all defaults hold, which is surely not what we <lb/>want. Of all the approaches, only -semantics and plausi-<lb/>bility structures, both of which are fully axiomatized by the <lb/>first-order extension of the KLM axioms, do not suffer from <lb/>this problem. <lb/>It may seem that this problem is perhaps not so serious. <lb/>After all, how often do we reason about lotteries? But, in <lb/>fact, this problem arises in many situations which are clearly <lb/>of the type with which we would like to deal. Assume, for <lb/>example, that we express the default &quot;birds typically fly&quot; as <lb/>Delgrande does, using the statement <lb/>1 <lb/>Bird ( )! § Fly &quot;! #! 0$ <lb/>4 ! <lb/>If we also believe that Tweety is a bird that does not <lb/>fly, so that our knowledge base contains the statement <lb/>true § Bird <lb/>Tweety ! 3 Fly <lb/>Tweety ! <lb/>, we could similarly <lb/>conclude true § false. Again, this is surely not what we <lb/>want. <lb/>Our framework allows us to deal with these problems. <lb/>Using plausibilities, (1) and (2) do not imply true § false, <lb/>since (3) does not follow from (1). That is, the lottery <lb/>paradox simply does not exist if we use plausibilities. The <lb/>flying bird example is somewhat more subtle. If we take <lb/>Tweety to be a nonrigid designator (so that it might denote <lb/>different individuals in different worlds), the two statements <lb/>are consistent, and the problem disappears. If, however, <lb/>Tweety is a rigid designator, the pair is inconsistent, as we <lb/>would expect. <lb/>This inconsistency suggests that we might not always <lb/>want to use (4) to represent &quot;birds typically fly&quot;. After <lb/>all, the former is a statement about a property believed to <lb/>hold of each individual bird, while the latter is a state-<lb/>ment about the class of birds. As argued in (Bacchus et al. <lb/>1994), defaults often arise from statistical facts about the <lb/>domain. That is, the default &quot;birds typically fly&quot; is often a <lb/>consequence of the empirical observation that &quot;almost all <lb/>birds fly&quot;. By defining a logic which allows us to express <lb/>statistical conditional statements, we provide the user an <lb/>alternative way of representing such defaults. We would, <lb/>of course, like such statements to impact our beliefs about <lb/>individual birds. In (Bacchus et al. 1994), the same issue <lb/>was addressed in the probabilistic context, by presenting an <lb/>approach for going from statistical knowledge bases to sub-<lb/>jective degrees of belief. We leave the problem of providing <lb/>a similar mechanism for conditional logic to future work. <lb/>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-<lb/>tion 2, we review the various approaches to conditional <lb/>logic in the propositional case; we also review the defi-<lb/>nition 4 of plausibility measures from (Friedman &amp; Halpern <lb/>1996) and show how they provide a common framework <lb/>for these different approaches. In Section 3, we discuss the <lb/>two ways in which we can extend propositional conditional <lb/>logic to first-order-statistical conditionals and subjective <lb/>conditionals-and ascribe semantics to both using plausi-<lb/>bilities. In Section 4, we provide a sound and complete <lb/>axiomatization for first-order subjective conditional asser-<lb/>tions. In Section 5, we discuss the generalization of the <lb/>other propositional approaches to the first-order case, by <lb/>investigating their behavior with respect to the lottery para-<lb/>dox. We also provide a brief comparison to some of the <lb/>other approaches suggested in the literature, deferring de-<lb/>tailed discussion to the full paper. We conclude in Section 6 <lb/>with discussion and some directions for further work. <lb/>2 Propositional conditional logic <lb/>The syntax of propositional conditional logic is simple. We <lb/>start with a set 5 of propositions and close off under the <lb/>usual propositional connectives ( , 6 , , and 7 ) and the <lb/>conditional connective § . That is, if 8 and 9 are formulas <lb/>in the language, so is 8 @ § ¥9 . <lb/>Many semantics have been proposed in the literature for <lb/>conditionals. Most of them involve structures of the form <lb/>BA #C D FE ! <lb/>, where A <lb/>is a set of possible worlds, E £ ! <lb/>is a <lb/>truth assignment to primitive propositions, and C is some <lb/>&quot;measure&quot; on A <lb/>such as a preference ordering (Lewis 1973; <lb/>Kraus, Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990). 3 We now describe <lb/>some of the proposals in the literature, and then show how <lb/>they can be generalized. Given a structure #A BC D GE ! <lb/>, let <lb/>© © H8 1 I A <lb/>be the set of worlds satisfying 8 . <lb/>P A possibility measure (Dubois &amp; Prade 1990) Poss is a <lb/>function Poss : 2Q SR T U© 0 1 such that Poss BA V! XW <lb/>1, <lb/>Poss (Y `! aW <lb/>0, and Poss cb d! eW <lb/>supf hg pi <lb/>Poss Bq £ sr ! <lb/>. A <lb/>possibility structure is a tuple #A Poss GE ! <lb/>, where Poss <lb/>is a possibility measure on A <lb/>. It satisfies a conditional <lb/>8 @ § ¥9 if either Poss © © H8 1 ! tW <lb/>0 or Poss © © H8 u v9 w ! ux <lb/>Poss © © H8 y u 9 ! <lb/>(Dubois &amp; Prade 1991). That is, ei-<lb/>ther 8 is impossible, in which case the conditional holds <lb/>vacuously, or 8 9 is more possible than 8 a 9 . <lb/>P A ¡ -ranking (or ordinal ranking) on A <lb/>(as defined by <lb/>(Goldszmidt &amp; Pearl 1992), based on ideas that go back <lb/>to (Spohn 1987)) is a function ¡ : 2Q T , where <lb/>W q r , such that ¡ BA V! XW <lb/>0, ¡ Y ! eW <lb/>, <lb/>and ¡ cb ! W <lb/>min f hg pi ¡ #q £ dr ! #! <lb/>. Intuitively, an ordinal <lb/>ranking assigns a degree of surprise to each subset of <lb/>worlds in A <lb/>, where 0 means unsurprising and higher <lb/>numbers denote greater surprise. A ¡ -structure is a tuple <lb/>#A G¡ GE ! <lb/>, where ¡ is an ordinal ranking on A <lb/>. It satisfies <lb/>a conditional 8 @ § V9 if either ¡ © © H8 1 ! W <lb/>or ¡ © © H8 9 ! <lb/>¡ © © H8 e a 9 ! <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 We could also consider a more general definition, in which <lb/>one associates a different &quot;measure&quot; with each world, as done by <lb/>Lewis, for example (Lewis 1973). It is straightforward to extend <lb/>our definitions to handle this. Since this issue is orthogonal to the <lb/>main point of the paper, we do not discuss it further here. <lb/></note>

			<body>P A preference ordering on A <lb/>is a partial order ¢ over <lb/>A <lb/>(Kraus, Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990; Shoham 1987). <lb/>Intuitively, £ ¢ £ ¦ <lb/>holds if £ is preferred to £ ¦ <lb/>. A <lb/>preferential structure is a tuple #A %¢ d FE ! <lb/>, where ¢ is <lb/>a partial order on A <lb/>. The intuition (Shoham 1987) is <lb/>that a preferential structure satisfies a conditional 8 @ § ¥9 <lb/>if all the most preferred worlds (i.e., the minimal worlds <lb/>according to ¢ ) in © © 8 1 satisfy 9 . However, there may <lb/>be no minimal worlds in © © 8 1 . This can happen if © © H8 <lb/>contains an infinite descending sequence $ e$ f$ ¢ g£ 2 ¢ £ 1 . <lb/>The simplest way to avoid this is to assume that ¢ is <lb/>well-founded; we do so here for simplicity. A yet more <lb/>general definition-one that works even if ¢ is not well-<lb/>founded-is given in (Lewis 1973; Boutilier 1994). We <lb/>discuss that in the full paper. <lb/>P A parameterized probability distribution (PPD) on A <lb/>is <lb/>a sequence q <lb/>Prh : i sj 0r of probability measures over <lb/>A <lb/>. A PPD structure is a tuple #A q <lb/>Prh : i dj 0r k GE ! <lb/>, <lb/>where q <lb/>Prh r is PPD over A <lb/>. Intuitively, it satisfies a <lb/>conditional 8 @ § ¥9 if the conditional probability 9 given <lb/>8 goes to 1 in the limit. Formally, 8 § &apos;9 is satisfied if <lb/>limh ml dn Prh © © H9 Go p© © H9 ! W <lb/>1 (where Prh © © H9 Go q© © H8 1 ! <lb/>is taken <lb/>to be 1 if Prh © © H8 1 ! rW <lb/>0). PPD structures were introduced <lb/>in (Goldszmidt, Morris, &amp; Pearl 1993) as a reformulation <lb/>of Pearl&apos;s -semantics (Pearl 1989). <lb/>These variants are quite different from each other. However, <lb/>as shown in (Friedman &amp; Halpern 1996), we can provide a <lb/>uniform framework for all of them using the notion of plau-<lb/>sibility measures. In fact, plausibility measures generalize <lb/>other types of measures, including probability measures (see <lb/>(Friedman &amp; Halpern 1995)). <lb/>A plausibility measure Pl on A <lb/>is a function that maps <lb/>subsets of A <lb/>to elements in some arbitrary partially ordered <lb/>set. We read Pl sb ! <lb/>as &quot;the plausibility of set b <lb/>&quot;. If Pl cb ! ut <lb/>Pl (v d! <lb/>, then v <lb/>is at least as plausible as b <lb/>. Formally, a <lb/>plausibility space is a tuple w W x BA Pl ! <lb/>, where A <lb/>is a set <lb/>of worlds and Pl maps subsets of A <lb/>to some set y , partially <lb/>ordered by a relation t <lb/>(so that t <lb/>is reflexive, transitive, <lb/>and anti-symmetric). As usual, we define the ordering <lb/>by <lb/>taking 2 1 <lb/>2 2 if 2 1 <lb/>t 2 2 and 2 1 z <lb/>W 2 2 . We assume that y <lb/>is pointed: that is, it contains two special elements { and <lb/>| such that | t 2 t { for all 2 ~} vy ; we further assume <lb/>that Pl #A V! W { and Pl Y ! W | . Since we want a set to be <lb/>at least as plausible as any of its subsets, we require: <lb/>A1. If b I v <lb/>, then Pl sb ! t <lb/>Pl v d! <lb/>. <lb/>Clearly, plausibility spaces generalize probability spaces. <lb/>Other approaches to dealing with uncertainty, such as pos-<lb/>sibility measures, ¡ -rankings, and belief functions (Shafer <lb/>1976), are also easily seen to be plausibility measures. <lb/>We can give semantics to conditionals using plausibility <lb/>in much the same way as it is done using possibility. A <lb/>plausibility structure is a tuple PL W BA Pl FE ! <lb/>, where Pl is <lb/>a plausibility measure on A <lb/>. We then define: <lb/>P PL o W 8 § &apos;9 if either Pl © © H8 1 ! XW | or Pl © © H8 y t9 ! <lb/>~x <lb/>Pl © © H8 e 9 w ! <lb/>. <lb/>Intuitively, 8 @ § ¥9 holds vacuously if 8 is impossible; oth-<lb/>erwise, it holds if 8 d 9 is more plausible than 8 9 . It is <lb/>easy to see that this semantics for conditionals generalizes <lb/>the semantics of conditionals in possibility structures and <lb/>¡ -structures. As shown in (Friedman &amp; Halpern 1996), it <lb/>also generalizes the semantics of conditionals in preferential <lb/>structures and PPD structures. More precisely, a mapping is <lb/>given from preferential structures to plausibility structures <lb/>such that #A 0¢ d GE ! o W 8 if and only if #A Pl FE ! o W 8 , <lb/>where Pl is the plausibility measure that corresponds to ¢ . <lb/>A similar mapping is also provided for PPD structures. <lb/>These results show that our semantics for conditionals <lb/>in plausibility structures generalizes the various approaches <lb/>examined in the literature. Does it capture our intuitions <lb/>about conditionals? In the AI literature, there has been dis-<lb/>cussion of the right properties of default statements (which <lb/>are essentially conditionals). While there has been little <lb/>consensus on what the &quot;right&quot; properties for defaults should <lb/>be, there has been some consensus on a reasonable &quot;core&quot; of <lb/>inference rules for default reasoning. This core, is known as <lb/>the KLM properties (Kraus, Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990). 4 <lb/>Do conditionals in plausibility structures satisfy these <lb/>properties? In general, they do not. To satisfy the KLM <lb/>properties we must limit our attention to plausibility struc-<lb/>tures that satisfy the following conditions: <lb/>A2. If b <lb/>, v <lb/>, and are pairwise disjoint sets, Pl sb v d! x <lb/>Pl ! <lb/>, and Pl sb d ! @x <lb/>Pl v d! <lb/>, then Pl sb ! x <lb/>Pl v d ! <lb/>. <lb/>A3. If Pl sb ! W <lb/>Pl (v d! W | , then Pl sb v d! W | . <lb/>A plausibility space #A Pl ! <lb/>is qualitative if it satisfies A2 <lb/>and A3. A plausibility structure #A Pl GE ! <lb/>is qualitative <lb/>if #A Pl ! <lb/>is a qualitative plausibility space. In (Friedman <lb/>&amp; Halpern 1996) it is shown that, in a very general sense, <lb/>qualitative plausibility structures capture default reasoning. <lb/>More precisely, the KLM properties are sound with respect <lb/>to a class of plausibility structures if and only if the class <lb/>consists of qualitative plausibility structures. Furthermore, <lb/>a very weak condition is necessary and sufficient in order for <lb/>the KLM properties to be a complete axiomatization of con-<lb/>ditional logic. As a consequence, once we consider a class <lb/>of structures where the KLM axioms are sound, it is almost <lb/>inevitable that they will also be complete with respect to <lb/>that class. This explains the somewhat surprising fact that <lb/>KLM properties characterize default entailment not just in <lb/>preferential structures, but also in -semantics, possibility <lb/>measures, and ¡ -rankings. Each one of these approaches <lb/>corresponds, in a precise sense, to a class of qualitative <lb/>plausibility structures. These results show that plausibility <lb/>structures provide a unifying framework for the characteri-<lb/>zation of default entailment in these different logics. <lb/>3 First-order conditional logic <lb/>We now want to generalize conditional logic to the first-<lb/>order case. As mentioned above, there are two distinct <lb/>notions of conditionals in first-order logic, one involving <lb/>statistical conditionals and one involving subjective con-<lb/>ditionals. For each of these, we use a different syntax, <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 Due to space limitations we do not review the KLM properties <lb/>here; see (Friedman &amp; Halpern 1996) in this proceedings. <lb/></note>

			<body>analogous to the syntax used in (Halpern 1990) for the prob-<lb/>abilistic case. <lb/>The syntax for statistical conditionals is fairly straightfor-<lb/>ward. Let 5 be a first-order vocabulary, consisting of predi-<lb/>cate and function symbols. (As usual, constant symbols are <lb/>viewed as 0-ary function symbols.) Starting with atomic <lb/>formulas of first-order logic, we form more complicated <lb/>formulas by closing off under truth-functional connectives <lb/>(i.e., F6 G , and 7 ), first-order quantification, and the fam-<lb/>ily of modal operators 8 y 9 , where <lb/>is a sequence of <lb/>distinct variables. We denote the resulting language u c F . <lb/>The intuitive reading of 8 <lb/>9 is that almost all of the <lb/>&apos;s that satisfy 8 also satisfy 9 . Thus, the <lb/>modality <lb/>binds the variables <lb/>in 8 and 9 . A typical formula in this <lb/>language is &amp; ( F ! y G ! #! <lb/>, which can be read <lb/>&quot;there is some such that most <lb/>&apos;s satisfying G ! <lb/>also <lb/>satisfy ( F ! <lb/>&quot;. 5 Note that we allow arbitrary nesting of <lb/>first-order and modal operators. <lb/>The syntax for subjective plausibilities is even sim-<lb/>pler than that for statistical plausibilities. Starting with <lb/>a first-order vocabulary 5 , we now close off under truth-<lb/>functional connectives, first-order quantification, and the <lb/>single modal operator § . Thus, a typical formula is <lb/>( &quot;! § &amp; G ! #! <lb/>. Let ( ` be the resulting lan-<lb/>guage (the &quot;subj&quot; stands for &quot;subjective&quot;, since the con-<lb/>ditionals are viewed as expressing subjective degrees of <lb/>belief). <lb/>We can ascribe semantics to both types of conditionals <lb/>using any one of the approaches described in the previous <lb/>section. (In fact, we do not even have to use the same <lb/>approach for both.) However, since we can embed all of the <lb/>approaches within the class of plausibility structures, we use <lb/>these as the basic semantics. As in the propositional case, <lb/>we can then analyze the behavior of the other approaches <lb/>simply by restricting attention to the appropriate subclass of <lb/>plausibility structures. <lb/>To give semantics to ( c F , we use (first-order) statisti-<lb/>cal plausibility structures, which generalize the semantics <lb/>of statistical probabilistic structures (Halpern 1990) and <lb/>statistical preferential structures (Brafman 1991). Statis-<lb/>tical plausibility structures are tuples of the form PL W <lb/>Dom FE h ( ! <lb/>, where Dom is a domain, E is an interpretation <lb/>assigning each predicate symbol and function symbol in 5 <lb/>a predicate or function of the right arity over Dom, and <lb/>associates with each number a plausibility measure Pl <lb/>on Dom . As usual, a valuation maps each variable to an <lb/>element of Dom. Given a structure <lb/>and a valuation , <lb/>we can associate with every formula 8 a truth value in a <lb/>straightforward way. The only nontrivial case is 8 D 9 . <lb/>We define % PL ¡ p <lb/>e¢ 8 ! dW £q <lb/>2 : <lb/>PL G ¤© ( ¤¥ <lb/>2 f ! o W 8 @r , where <lb/>¤© ( )¥ <lb/>2 f is a valuation that maps each <lb/>in <lb/>to the corre-<lb/>sponding element in <lb/>2 and agrees with elsewhere. <lb/>P <lb/>PL G ! o W 8 <lb/>9 if either Pl PL ¡ ¦ <lb/>e¢ 8 ! #! aW | or <lb/>Pl PL ¡ ¦ <lb/>e¢ 8 D §9 ! #! x <lb/>Pl PL ¡ p <lb/>e¢ 8 D D 9 ! #! <lb/>, where <lb/>is the length of <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>We remark that we need the sequence of plausibility mea-<lb/>sures ¨todealwithtuplesofdifferentarity. The analogous se-<lb/>quence of probability measures was not needed in (Halpern <lb/>1990), since, given a probability measure on Dom, we can <lb/>consider the product measure on Dom <lb/>. In the full paper, <lb/>we place some requirements on Pl to force it to have the <lb/>key properties we expect of product measures. We omit <lb/>further discussion of statistical plausibilities here, and focus <lb/>instead on subjective plausibilities. <lb/>To give semantics to ( ` , we use (first-order) subjec-<lb/>tive plausibility structures. These are tuples of the form <lb/>PL W &apos; <lb/>Dom A Pl GE ! <lb/>, where Dom is a domain, BA Pl ! <lb/>is <lb/>a plausibility space and E £ ! <lb/>is an interpretation assign-<lb/>ing to each predicate symbol and function symbol in 5 a <lb/>predicate or function of the right arity over Dom. We de-<lb/>fine the set of worlds that satisfy 8 given the valuation <lb/>to be © © H8 PL ¡ ¢ W ©q £ : <lb/>PL F£ d F ! o W 8 @r . (We omit the <lb/>subscript whenever it is clear from context.) For subjective <lb/>conditionals, we have <lb/>P <lb/>PL F£ d F ! o W 8 @ § ¥9 if Pl © © H8 1 ª PL ¡ ¢ ! tW | or Pl © © H8 <lb/>9 c PL ¡ ¢ ! x <lb/>Pl © © H8 a « @9 c PL ¡ ¢ ! <lb/>. <lb/>We do not treat terms as rigid designators here. That is, <lb/>in different worlds, a term can denote different individuals. <lb/>For example, if E £ ! F ¬ 0! z <lb/>W E £ ¦ ! F (¬ %! <lb/>, the constant ¬ <lb/>denotes <lb/>different individuals in £ and £ ¦ <lb/>. Because terms are not <lb/>rigid designators, we cannot substitute terms for universally <lb/>quantified variables. (A similar phenomenon holds in other <lb/>modal logics where terms are not rigid (Garson 1977).) For <lb/>example, let 8 be an abbreviation for 8 @ § false. Notice <lb/>that <lb/>PL F£ ! o W 8 if Pl © © H 8 1 ! W | ; i.e., 8 asserts that the <lb/>plausibility of 8 is the same as that of the empty set, so that <lb/>8 is true &quot;almost everywhere&quot;. We define ® d8 as 8 ; <lb/>this says that 8 is true in some non-negligible set of worlds. <lb/>Suppose ¬ <lb/>is a constant that does not appear in the formula <lb/>8 . As we show in the full paper, ® d8 &quot;! 7 ¯® 8 (¬ %! <lb/>is <lb/>not valid in our framework; that is, we cannot substitute <lb/>constants for universally quantified variables. We could <lb/>substitute if ¬ <lb/>were rigid. We can get the effect of rigidity <lb/>by assuming that &amp; 1 uW ©¬ %! #! <lb/>holds. Thus, we do not <lb/>lose expressive power by not assuming rigidity. <lb/>4 Axiomatizing default reasoning in <lb/>plausibility structures <lb/>We now want to show that plausibility structures provide <lb/>an appropriate semantics for a first-order logic of defaults. <lb/>As in the propositional case, this is true only if we restrict <lb/>attention to qualitative plausibility structures, i.e., those sat-<lb/>isfying conditions A2 and A3 above. Let °± ² <lb/>` be the <lb/>class of all subjective qualitative plausibility structures. We <lb/>provide a sound and complete axiom system for °1± ² <lb/>( ` , and <lb/>show that it is the natural extension of the KLM properties <lb/>to the first-order case. <lb/>The axiomatization ³ d ( ` , specified in Figure 1, consists <lb/>of three parts. The first set of axioms (C0-C5 together <lb/>with the rules MP, LLE, and RW) is simply the standard <lb/>axiomatization of propositional conditional logic (Hughes <lb/>C0.

F6 is known as the <lb/>Barcan formula; it describes the relationship between and <lb/>in structures where all the worlds have the same domain (as <lb/>is the case here). F7 and F8 describe the interaction between <lb/>and equality, and hold because we are essentially treating <lb/>variables as rigid designators. <lb/>It remains to explain the notion of &quot;substitutable&quot; in F1. <lb/>Clearly we cannot substitute a term Ï for <lb/>with free variables <lb/>that might be captured by some quantifiers in 8 ; for example, <lb/>while &amp; ( z <lb/>W ! <lb/>is true as long as the domain has at least <lb/>two elements, if we substitute for <lb/>, we get &amp; z <lb/>W ! <lb/>, <lb/>which is surely false. In the case of first-order logic, it <lb/>suffices to define &quot;substitutable&quot; so as to make sure this does <lb/>not happen (see (Enderton 1972) for details). However, in <lb/>modal logics such as this one, we have to be a little more <lb/>careful. As we observed in Section 3, we cannot substitute <lb/>terms for universally quantified variables in a modal context, <lb/>since terms are not in general rigid. Thus, we require that <lb/>if 8 is a formula that has occurrences of § , then the only <lb/>terms that are substitutable for <lb/>in 8 are other variables. <lb/>Theorem 4.1: C ( ` is a sound and complete axiomatiza-<lb/>tion of u ` with respect to °1± ² <lb/>` . <lb/>We claim that ³ d ( ` is the weakest &quot;natural&quot; first-order <lb/>extension of the KLM properties. The bulk of the proposi-<lb/>tional fragment of this axiom system (axioms C1-C4, LLE, <lb/>and RW) corresponds precisely to the KLM properties. The <lb/>remaining axiom (C5) captures the fact that the plausibility <lb/>function Ð Pl is independent of the world. This property does <lb/>not appear in (Kraus, Lehmann, &amp; Magidor 1990) since they <lb/>do not allow nesting of conditionals. As discussed above, <lb/>the remaining axioms are standard properties of first-order <lb/>modal logic. <lb/>5 Alternative Approaches <lb/>In the previous section we showed that ³ d ( ` is sound and <lb/>complete with respect to °± ² <lb/>( ` . What happens if we use <lb/>one of the approaches described in Section 2 to give seman-<lb/>tics to conditionals? As noted above, we can associate with <lb/>each of these approach a subset of qualitative plausibility <lb/>structures. Let ÒÑ f <lb/>` ( ÒÑ ( ` Ó ` ÒÑ Ô # <lb/>` and XÕ ` be the <lb/>subsets of °1± ² <lb/>( ` that correspond to well-founded preferen-<lb/>tial orderings, preferential orderings, ¡ -rankings, possibility <lb/>measures, and PPDs, respectively. From Theorem 4.1, we <lb/>immediately get <lb/>Theorem 5.1: C ` is sound in ÒÑ f <lb/>( ` , ÖÑ <lb/>` , ÒÑ ` , <lb/>Ó <lb/>( ` , ÒÑ pÔ B <lb/>( ` , and Õ <lb/>( ` . <lb/>Is ³ d ( ` complete with respect to these approaches? <lb/>Even at the propositional level, it is well known that be-<lb/>cause ¡ rankings and possibility measures induce plausibil-<lb/>ity measures that are total (rather than partial) orders, they <lb/>satisfy the following additional property: <lb/>C6. 8 @ § ¥9 D 8 § &apos; × ! 7 8 × § &apos;9 ! <lb/>. <lb/>In addition, the plausibility measures induced by ¡ rankings, <lb/>possibility measures, and semantics are easily seen to have <lb/>the property that { x | <lb/>. This leads to the following axiom: <lb/>C7. <lb/>true § false ! <lb/>. <lb/>In the propositional setting, these additional axioms and the <lb/>basic propositional conditional system (i.e., C0-C5, MP, <lb/>LLE, and RW) lead to sound and complete axiomatization <lb/>of the corresponding (propositional) structures. <lb/>Does the same phenomenon occur in the first-order case? <lb/>For -semantics, it does. <lb/>Theorem 5.2: C ` eØ C7 is a sound and complete axiom-<lb/>atization of u ` w.r.t. XÕ ` . <lb/>But, unlike the propositional case, the remaining approaches <lb/>all satisfy properties beyond ³ s ` , C6, and C7. And these <lb/>additional properties are ones that we would argue are un-<lb/>desirable, since they cause the lottery paradox. Recall that <lb/>the lottery paradox can be represented with two formulas: <lb/>(1) 1 <lb/>true § ¥ Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>states that every individual is <lb/>unlikely to win the lottery, while (2) true § ¥&amp; <lb/>Winner ( )! <lb/>states that is is likely that some individual does win the <lb/>lottery. We start by showing that (1) and (2) are consis-<lb/>tent in °1± ² <lb/>( ` . We define a first-order subjective plau-<lb/>sibility structure PL lot <lb/>W Ù <lb/>Dom lot A <lb/>lot Pl lot FE lot <lb/>! <lb/>as fol-<lb/>lows: Dom lot is a countable domain consisting of the in-<lb/>dividuals 1 2 3 $ f$ %$ <lb/>; A <lb/>lot consists of a countable num-<lb/>ber of worlds £ 1 G£ 2 G£ 3 $ f$ f$ <lb/>; Pl lot gives the empty set <lb/>plausibility 0, each non-empty finite set plausibility 1 ¥ <lb/>2, <lb/>and each infinite set plausibility 1; finally, the denotation <lb/>of Winner in world £ h according to E lot is the singleton <lb/>set q 2 h Br (that is, in world £ h the lottery winner is in-<lb/>dividual 2 h ). It is easy to check that © © Winner 2 h ! W <lb/>A UÚ ©q £ h r , so Pl lot <lb/>© © H Winner 2 h ! ! &apos;W <lb/>1 x <lb/>1 ¥ <lb/>2 W <lb/>Pl © © Winner 2 `h ! ! <lb/>; hence, PL lot satisfies (1). On the other <lb/>hand, © © H&amp; <lb/>Winner &quot;! W A <lb/>, so Pl lot <lb/>© © H&amp; <lb/>Winner &quot;! ! §x <lb/>Pl lot <lb/>© © H &amp; <lb/>Winner &quot;! ! <lb/>; hence PL lot satisfies (2). It is also <lb/>easy to verify that Pl lot is a qualitative measure, i.e., satisfies <lb/>A2 and A3. A similar construction allows us to capture a <lb/>situation where birds typically fly but we know that Tweety <lb/>does not fly. <lb/>What happens to the lottery paradox in the other ap-<lb/>proaches? First consider well-founded preferential struc-<lb/>tures, i.e., ÒÑ f <lb/>( ` . In these structures, 8 @ § ¥9 holds if 9 holds <lb/>in all the preferred worlds that satisfy 8 . Thus, (1) implies <lb/>that for any domain element 2 , 2 is not a winner in the most <lb/>preferred worlds. On the other hand, (2) implies that in <lb/>the most preferred worlds, some domain element wins. To-<lb/>gether both imply that there are no preferred worlds. When, <lb/>in general, does an argument of this type go through? As <lb/>we now show, it is a consequence of <lb/>A2 . If q eb h : i t} © kr are pairwise disjoint sets, b SW <lb/>hh g pÛ b h , 0 } v , and for all i Ö} v Ú q <lb/>0r , Pl cb ÜÚ b h ! sx <lb/>Pl cb h ! <lb/>, then Pl cb <lb/>0 <lb/>! @x <lb/>Pl cb 3Ú tb <lb/>0 <lb/>! <lb/>. <lb/>Recall that A2 states that if b <lb/>0 , b <lb/>1 , and b <lb/>2 are disjoint, <lb/>Pl sb <lb/>0 b <lb/>1 <lb/>! x <lb/>Pl sb <lb/>2 <lb/>! <lb/>, and Pl cb <lb/>0 b <lb/>2 <lb/>! dx <lb/>Pl cb <lb/>1 <lb/>! <lb/>, then <lb/>Pl sb <lb/>0 <lb/>! @x <lb/>Pl sb <lb/>1 b <lb/>2 <lb/>! <lb/>. It is easy to check that for any finite <lb/>number of sets, a similar property follows from A1 and A2 <lb/>by induction. A2 asserts that a condition of this type holds <lb/>even for an infinite collection of sets. This is not implied <lb/>by A1 and A2. To see this, consider the plausibility model <lb/>PL lot that we used to capture the infinite lottery: Take b <lb/>0 to <lb/>be empty and take b h , i x <lb/>1, to be the singleton consisting <lb/>of the world £ h . Then Pl lot <lb/>sb XÚ b h ! @W <lb/>1 x <lb/>1 ¥ <lb/>2 W <lb/>Pl lot <lb/>cb h ! <lb/>, <lb/>but Pl lot <lb/>sb <lb/>0 <lb/>! W <lb/>0 <lb/>1 W <lb/>Pl h sÝ 0 <lb/>b h ! <lb/>. Hence, A2 does not <lb/>hold for plausibility structures in general. It does, however, <lb/>hold for certain subclasses: <lb/>Proposition 5.3: A2 holds in every plausibility structure <lb/>in ÖÑ f <lb/>` and Ó ( ` . <lb/>In the full paper we show that A2 is characterized by the <lb/>axiom called <lb/>3 by Delgrande: <lb/>3. 8 § &apos;9 ! 7 8 § 9 ! <lb/>if <lb/>does not occur free in 8 . <lb/>This axiom can be viewed as an infinitary version of ax-<lb/>iom C2 (which is essentially KLM&apos;s And Rule). Since A2 <lb/>holds in ÒÑ f <lb/>( ` and Ó ` , it follows that <lb/>3 does as well. <lb/>It is easy to see that the axiom <lb/>3 leads to the lottery para-<lb/>dox: From 1 <lb/>true § Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>, <lb/>3 would imply that <lb/>true § Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>. <lb/>As we show in the full paper, A2 does not hold in ÒÑ Ô # <lb/>` <lb/>and ÒÑ ` . In fact, the infinite lottery is consistent in these <lb/>classes, although a somewhat unnatural model is required <lb/>to express it. For example, we can represent the lottery <lb/>via a possibility structure <lb/>Dom lot A <lb/>lot Poss FE lot <lb/>! <lb/>, where <lb/>all the components besides Poss are just as in the plausibil-<lb/>ity structure PL lot that represents the lottery scenario, and <lb/>Poss £ h ! W i ¥ k i rØ 1 ! <lb/>. This means that if i x &apos;Þ <lb/>, then it <lb/>is more possible that individual i wins than individual Þ <lb/>. <lb/>Moreover ß , this possibility approaches 1 as i increases. It <lb/>is not hard to show that this possibility structure satisfies <lb/>formulas (1) and (2). <lb/>We can block this type of behavior by considering a <lb/>crooked lottery, where there is one individual who is more <lb/>likely to win than the rest, but is still unlikely to win. To <lb/>formalize this in the language, we add the following formula <lb/>that we call Crooked: <lb/>&amp; 1 <lb/>Winner &quot;! § false ! &amp; 1 z <lb/>W 7 <lb/># <lb/>Winner &quot;! 6 Winner ! B! § Winner ! #! #! <lb/>The first part of this formula states that each individual has <lb/>some plausibility of winning; in the language of plausibility, <lb/>this means that Pl 2 ! x | <lb/>for each domain element 2 . The <lb/>second part states that there is an individual who is more <lb/>likely to win than the rest. To see this, recall that 8 @6 9 ! § ¥9 <lb/>implies that either Pl © © H8 6 D9 ! W | (which cannot happen <lb/>here because of the first clause of Crooked) or Pl © © H8 1 ! à <lb/>Pl © © 9 w ! <lb/>. We take the crooked lottery to be formalized by the <lb/>formula <lb/>true § á Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>true § á&amp; <lb/>Winner ( )! B! <lb/>Crooked. Note, that <lb/>true § &apos; Winner ( )! B! <lb/>implies that <lb/>every individual is unlikely to win. <lb/>It is easy to model the crooked lottery using plausibil-<lb/>ity. Consider the structure PL ¦ <lb/>lot <lb/>W á <lb/>Dom lot A <lb/>lot Pl ¦ <lb/>lot GE lot <lb/>! <lb/>, <lb/>which is identical to PL lot except for the plausibility mea-<lb/>sure Pl ¦ <lb/>lot . We define Pl ¦ <lb/>lot <lb/>£ 1 <lb/>! W <lb/>3 ¥ <lb/>4; Pl ¦ <lb/>lot <lb/>£ h ! W <lb/>1 ¥ <lb/>2 <lb/>for i x <lb/>1; Pl ¦ <lb/>lot <lb/>sb ! <lb/>of a finite set b <lb/>is 3 ¥ <lb/>4 if £ 1 } b <lb/>, <lb/>and 1 ¥ <lb/>2 if £ 1 z <lb/>} b <lb/>; and Pl lot <lb/>sb ! aW <lb/>1 for infinite b <lb/>. It <lb/>is easy to verify that PL ¦ <lb/>lot satisfies Crooked, taking 2 1 <lb/>to be the special individual who is most likely to win <lb/>(since Pl © © Winner 2 1 <lb/>! ! hW <lb/>3 ¥ <lb/>4 x <lb/>1 ¥ <lb/>2 W <lb/>Pl © © Winner 2 h ! ! <lb/>for i x <lb/>1). It is also easy to verify that PL ¦ <lb/>lot o W <lb/>1 <lb/>true § ¥ Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>true § ¥&amp; <lb/>Winner &quot;! #! <lb/>. <lb/>As we show in the full paper, the crooked lottery cannot <lb/>be captured in ÒÑ pÔ B <lb/>( ` and ÒÑ ( ` . This shows that, once we <lb/>move to first-order logic, possibility structures and preferen-<lb/>tial structures satisfy extra properties over and above those <lb/>characterized by ³ s ` . <lb/>Although our focus thus far has been on subjective con-<lb/>ditionals, the situation for statistical conditionals is similar. <lb/>We have already remarked that we can construct &quot;statisti-<lb/>cal&quot; first-order analogues of all the approaches considered <lb/>in the propositional case. As in the subjective case, all of <lb/>them suffer From problems except for the one based on <lb/>-semantics. We illustrate this using by considering the ex-<lb/>tension of well-founded preferential structures to first-order <lb/>conditionals over the domain, as defined by Brafman (1991). <lb/>Consider the statement <lb/>true Married ( F ! B! <lb/>5 ! <lb/>This states that for any individual , most individuals are <lb/>not married to . This seems reasonable since each is <lb/>married to at most one individual, which clearly constitutes <lb/>a small fraction of the population. The analogue of <lb/>3 holds <lb/>in Brafman&apos;s logic, for the same reason that it does in ÒÑ f <lb/>` . <lb/>As a consequence, (5) implies <lb/>true Married G ! %$ <lb/>That is, most people are not married! This certainly does not <lb/>seem to be a reasonable conclusion. It is straightforward to <lb/>construct similar examples for the statistical variants of the <lb/>other approaches, again, with the exception of plausibility <lb/>structures and -semantics. We note that these problems <lb/>occur for precisely the same reasons they occur in the sub-<lb/>jective case. In particular, property A2 , when stated for the <lb/>plausibility over domain elements, is the necessary property <lb/>for the statistical analogue of <lb/>3. <lb/>We observe that problems similar to the lottery paradox <lb/>occur in the approach of Lehmann and Magidor (1990), <lb/>which can be viewed as a hybrid of subjective and statistical <lb/>conditionals based on on preferential structures. Finally, <lb/>we observe that the approach of (Schlechta 1995), which <lb/>is based on a novel representation of &quot;large&quot; subsets, is in <lb/>the spirit of our notion of statistical defaults (although his <lb/>language is somewhat less expressive than ours). We defer <lb/>a detailed discussion of these approaches to the full paper. <lb/>6 Discussion <lb/>We have shown how to ascribe semantics to a first-order <lb/>logic of conditionals in a number of ways. Our analysis <lb/>shows that, once we move to the first-order case, significant <lb/>differences arise between approaches that were shown to <lb/>be equivalent in the propositional case. This vindicates the <lb/>intuition that there are significant differences between these <lb/>approaches, which the propositional language is simply too <lb/>weak to capture. Our analysis also supports our choice of <lb/>plausibility structures as the semantics for first-order de-<lb/>faults: it shows that, with the exception of -semantics, <lb/>all the previous approaches have significant shortcomings, <lb/>which manifest themselves in lottery-paradox type situa-<lb/>tions. <lb/>What does all this say about default reasoning? As we <lb/>have argued, statements like &quot;birds typically fly&quot; should <lb/>perhaps be thought of as statistical statements, and should <lb/>thus be represented as Bird ( )! Fly &quot;! <lb/>. Such a repre-<lb/>sentation gives us a logic of defaults, in which statements <lb/>such as &quot;birds typically fly&quot; and &quot;birds typically do not fly&quot; <lb/>are inconsistent, as we would expect. <lb/>Of course, what we really want to do with such typicality <lb/>statements is to draw default conclusions about individuals. <lb/>Suppose we believe such a typicality statement. What other <lb/>beliefs should follow? In general, <lb/>Bird &quot;! § Fly &quot;! #! <lb/>does not follow; we should not necessarily believe that all <lb/>birds are likely to fly. We may well know that Tacky the <lb/>penguin does not fly. As long as Tacky is a rigid des-<lb/>ignator, this is simply inconsistent with believing that all <lb/>birds are likely to fly. In the absence of information about <lb/>any particularly bird, 1 <lb/>Bird ( )! § Fly &quot;! #! <lb/>may well be <lb/>a reasonable belief to hold. Moreover, no matter what we <lb/>know about exceptional birds, it seems reasonable to believe <lb/>true <lb/>Bird &quot;! § Fly &quot;! #! <lb/>: almost all birds are likely to <lb/>fly (assuming we have a logic that allows the obvious com-<lb/>bination of statistical and subjective plausibility). <lb/>Unfortunately, we do not have a general approach that will <lb/>let us go from believing that birds typically fly to believing <lb/>that almost all birds are likely to fly. Nor do we have an <lb/>approach that allows us to conclude that Tweety is likely to <lb/>fly given <lb/>â that birds typically fly and Tweety is a bird (and <lb/>that we know nothing else about Tweety). These issues were <lb/>addressed in the first-order setting by both Lehmann and <lb/>Magidor (1990) and Delgrande (1988). The key feature of <lb/>their approaches, as well as other propositional approaches <lb/>rests upon getting a suitable notion of irrelevance. While <lb/>we also do not have a general solution to the problem of <lb/>irrelevance, we believe that plausibility structures give us <lb/>the tools to study it in an abstract setting. We suspect that <lb/>many of the intuitions behind probabilistic approaches that <lb/>allow us to cope with irrelevance (Bacchus et al. 1994) can <lb/>also be brought to bear here. We hope to return to this issue <lb/>in future work. <lb/></body>
