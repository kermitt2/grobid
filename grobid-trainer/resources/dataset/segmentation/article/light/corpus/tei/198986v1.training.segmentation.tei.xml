			<front>Summary <lb/>Apoptotic cells are cleared after exposing &quot;eat me&quot; ligands, including phosphatidylserine (PS), <lb/>but the signaling pathway in the phagocytic cell that leads to engulfment remains poorly <lb/>understood. Here, by transfecting the engulfment receptor Draper into Drosophila S2 cells and <lb/>using PS-coated beads to mimic apoptotic cells, we have created a simplified system for <lb/>studying this process. We show that ligand-bound Draper forms mobile microclusters that recruit <lb/>effector proteins and exclude a transmembrane phosphatase, suggesting a kinetic segregation <lb/>mechanism for receptor activation similar to T cell receptors. Like the TCR, Draper&apos;s <lb/>extracellular domain and ligand can be replaced with other interacting modules. We show that <lb/>phosphorylation of Draper&apos;s ITAM motif occurs first and is a dominant contributor to signaling. <lb/>After ITAM phosphorylation, additional residues become phosphorylated and contribute to <lb/>signaling efficiency. Our results demonstrate broad mechanistic similarities between Draper and <lb/>mammalian immune receptor activation and an ability to reprogram engulfment signaling. <lb/>Keywords: Signaling, phagocytosis, cell engulfment, corpse clearance, efferocytosis, apoptosis, <lb/>phosphatidylserine, Drosophila, Draper, Shark <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The prompt clearance of dying cells and debris is essential for maintaining homeostasis and <lb/>promoting tissue repair (Arandjelovic and Ravichandran, 2015; Neumann et al., 2015; Reddien <lb/>and Horvitz, 2004). In healthy tissue, resident and infiltrating phagocytes clear cell corpses and <lb/>debris through specific recognition, uptake, and digestion (Elliott and Ravichandran, 2010). <lb/>Defects in clearance result in autoimmunity and further tissue damage (Elliott and <lb/>Ravichandran, 2010; Iram et al., 2016). Despite the importance of efficient clearance across <lb/>multicellular life, our understanding of the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood in <lb/>comparison to other signaling systems. Important questions about how an apoptotic corpse <lb/>triggers its clearance by professional phagocytic cells remain unanswered. Developing a better <lb/>understanding of this process could lead to new strategies of enhancing clearance under <lb/>conditions of extreme injury or enabling engulfment of choice targets such as cancer cells. <lb/>Apoptotic cell clearance requires a complex signaling network triggered by interactions between <lb/>receptors on the phagocyte and ligands exposed on the dying cells. These &quot;eat me&quot; signals <lb/>trigger cytosolic signaling that ultimately promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements that power <lb/>corpse internalization (Ravichandran and Lorenz, 2007; Reddien and Horvitz, 2004). <lb/>Phagocytes express receptors that recognize distinct ligands either directly or through bridging <lb/>molecules (S. A. Freeman and Grinstein, 2014; Penberthy and Ravichandran, 2016). Although <lb/>the basic mechanics of clearance are likely conserved across metazoans, the receptors and <lb/>ligands are diverse. Perhaps as a consequence of this molecular diversity, the biochemical and <lb/>biophysical triggers of phagocytic receptor activation and the downstream consequences of <lb/>triggering remain unclear. Important open questions include: How do apoptotic ligands cause <lb/>the phosphorylation of receptor cytosolic tails? How do ligated receptors organize themselves <lb/>on plasma membranes? How are cytosolic effectors recruited to receptors? <lb/></body>

			<body>Draper is a Drosophila receptor that is expressed in glia, where it promotes clearance of <lb/>damaged axons, and in the somatic epithelium, where it functions to remove dying cells from <lb/>the follicle (Etchegaray et al., 2012; M. R. Freeman et al., 2003; MacDonald et al., 2006). <lb/>Draper is similar in domain structure to the mammalian protein Megf10 and CED-1, the first <lb/>described apoptotic corpse receptor in C. elegans. All three receptors contain single pass <lb/>transmembrane domains that connect extracellular EGF repeats to intracellular tyrosine <lb/>phosphorylation sites that are presumed to recruit one or more downstream effectors (Scheib et <lb/>al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2001; Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). Draper function has been dissected <lb/>genetically, especially in its damaged axon clearance role, which defined a &quot;parts list&quot; of other <lb/>proteins involved in engulfment signaling, including the kinases Src42a and Shark and the <lb/>adapter protein Crk (Lu et al., 2014; Ziegenfuss et al., 2008; 2012). However, biochemical <lb/>interactions are less well understood, and how these molecules work together to promote <lb/>clearance remains an open question. In particular, our understanding of Draper phosphorylation <lb/>and the immediate downstream events is poor. <lb/>A clue to the mechanism of Draper activity comes from the recognition that its sequence bears <lb/>an Immune Tyrosine Activation Motif (ITAM) domain that is found in several copies in the T cell <lb/>receptor, a receptor that evolved in vertebrates with an adaptive immune system (Schultz et al., <lb/>2000; Zhou et al., 2001; Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). Furthermore, Shark, an important kinase in the <lb/>engulfment signaling pathway uncovered through genetics, bears domain and sequence identify <lb/>to ZAP70 and Syk, tyrosine kinases involved in immune responses which bind directly to <lb/>doubly-phosphorylated tyrosines in the ITAM domain (Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). A subset of <lb/>molecules implicated in Draper signaling (e.g. Crk) also contain SH2 and SH3 domains that <lb/>bear some similarity to multivalent adapters such as Grb2 and Gads that function in mammalian <lb/>immune signaling and other systems (Choudhuri and Dustin, 2010). While these genetic and <lb/></body>

			<body>sequence level clues are tantalizing, evidence showing that Draper has functional parallels with <lb/>mammalian adaptive immune signaling is lacking. Understanding both the functional similarities <lb/>and differences between Draper and adaptive immune receptor signaling could provide <lb/>important clues into the mechanism of phagocytosis. <lb/>Here, we have reconstituted Draper-mediated signaling in Drosophila S2 cells to understand <lb/>how this receptor triggers phagocytosis. We find that Draper ligation to the lipid <lb/>phosphatidylserine (PS) incorporated into supported lipid bilayers is sufficient to induce its <lb/>phosphorylation and a signaling cascade leading to engulfment. Like the TCR, ligated Draper <lb/>forms mobile microclusters that shift a kinase-phosphatase balance toward receptor <lb/>phosphorylation and the recruitment of downstream effector proteins. We also reveal other <lb/>mechanistic parallels between Draper signaling and T cell signaling, including the ability to <lb/>replace the extracellular module of Draper and PS with an inducible artificial receptor-ligand <lb/>interaction. Unlike the TCR, where the ITAM phosphorylation domain is sufficient for signaling, <lb/>we show that full activation of Draper requires an initial ITAM phosphorylation followed by the <lb/>phosphorylation of other tyrosines in its tail domain. The reconstitution and reprogramming of <lb/>Draper signaling reveals how distinct modules in the receptor work in concert to promote <lb/>signaling and uncovers new insight into functional similarities and differences between <lb/>phagocytic and mammalian adaptive immune signaling systems. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Cellular reconstitution of Draper signaling <lb/>We used cultured Drosophila S2 cells, which are derived from a hemocyte lineage (Schneider, <lb/>1972), as a cellular system for reconstituting phagocytosis. Drosophila S2 cells display a very <lb/>low level of engulfment of cell corpses (Fig. 1A), which were prepared by inducing apoptosis in <lb/>S2 cells by addition of 1 ÂµM actinomycin for 16 hr. We hypothesized that the level of <lb/>engulfment might be low because S2 cells lack sufficient levels of engulfment receptors. <lb/>Consistent with this idea Draper, the best known engulfment receptor in Drosophila, is <lb/>expressed at low levels in S2 cells as measured by RNA-Seq (Cherbas et al., 2011). <lb/>Fluorescently-labeled corpses were then added to cultures of either Draper-or control mCherry-<lb/>transfected S2 cells and, after 45 min, the presence of internalized annexinV-647-labeled <lb/>corpses was scored. Our results revealed that Draper transfection increased the uptake of <lb/>apoptotic cell corpses by ~5 fold (Fig. 1A). <lb/>Apoptotic cells express an array of &quot;eat me&quot; ligands (Ravichandran and Lorenz, 2007). As a <lb/>next step, we sought to provide a simplified target of uniform size. The lipid phosphatidylserine <lb/>(PS) is exposed on dying cells and is considered to be an important &quot;eat me&quot; signal (Fadok et <lb/>al., 1992). PS was proposed to be a Draper activator (Tung et al., 2013), but a protein ligand for <lb/>Draper has also been suggested (Kuraishi et al., 2009). It has not been established whether PS <lb/>is necessary and sufficient for Draper-mediated engulfment. To determine if PS alone might <lb/>suffice for Draper-mediated engulfment, we replaced the apoptotic cells with 6.5 micron <lb/>diameter silica beads coated with a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) containing 10% PS and 0.5% <lb/>atto390-PE lipid for visualization by microscopy (Fig. 1B). Draper-GFP S2 cells engulfed ~0.8 <lb/>PS beads/cell, on average, after a 30 min incubation (Fig. 1B), which was 50-fold higher than <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>the ingestion of beads coated only with PC alone. Control GFP S2 cells also engulfed PS-<lb/>coated beads ~7 fold less efficiently than the Draper-GFP transfected cells, (Fig. 1B). Draper-<lb/>GFP S2 cells engulfed beads at 2.5% PS lipid content and showed increasing engulfment up to <lb/>12.5% PS (Fig. 1C). The PS concentrations that promote engulfment of beads are within the <lb/>physiological range present on dead and dying cells (Leventis and Grinstein, 2010). Thus, our <lb/>S2 cell system represents a simplified engulfment assay that is dependent on 1) overexpression <lb/>of the Draper receptor, and 2) PS exposed on a SLB-coated bead. Importantly, these results <lb/>also demonstrate that PS is a functional ligand for Draper and is necessary and sufficient for <lb/>Draper-mediated engulfment. <lb/>We next performed live cell microscopy to visualize the process of Draper-mediated engulfment <lb/>of PS beads (stills Fig. 1D, Movie 1). We co-transfected Draper-mCherry and LifeAct-GFP in S2 <lb/>cells and imaged PS bead engulfment by time-lapse imaging. Draper-mCherry expressing cells <lb/>formed a synapse with PS beads and rapidly began forming a phagocytic cup; F-actin, as <lb/>assessed by LifeAct-GFP signal, localized at the edges of the cup and the leading edge of the <lb/>cup extended gradually around the bead. When the phagocytic cup was complete, the PS bead <lb/>was internalized. Thus, our system is useful for determining the kinetics of PS bead engulfment <lb/>and following the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and membranes downstream of Draper <lb/>activation. <lb/>Draper ligation nucleates the formation of mobile microclusters enriched in <lb/>phosphotyrosine and phosphotyrosine-binding proteins <lb/>After engaging with damaged axon, Draper expressed in glial cells becomes tyrosine <lb/>phosphorylated, which then enables it to recruit a Syk-related related tyrosine kinase called <lb/>Shark (Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). After incubating Draper-GFP S2 cells with 10% PS beads, we <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>found a strong pTyr signal at the plasma membrane at the interface between Draper-GFP S2 <lb/>cell and the PS bead, which diminished after internalization (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the <lb/>studies of Ziegenfuss et al. (2008), we also found that Shark-mCherry co-localized with Draper-<lb/>GFP at the interface between PS bead and the Draper-transfected S2 cell (Fig. 2B). <lb/>To better visualize the behavior of Draper and the recruitment of proteins to the plasma <lb/>membrane, we developed a signaling system that is compatible with Total Internal Reflection <lb/>Fluorescence-Microscopy (TIRF-M), a technique that confines illumination to within ~200 nm of <lb/>the glass coverslip. Instead of using a bead, we coated the glass coverslip with a supported lipid <lb/>bilayer contain 10% PS (Fig 2C). When Draper-GFP S2 cells settled on this PS supported lipid <lb/>bilayer, the cells spread rapidly on the surface in a futile effort to engulf the planar surface. <lb/>Strikingly, Draper-GFP organized in microclusters that underwent retrograde flow from the <lb/>leading edge towards a central synapse (Fig. 2D; Movie 2). The behavior of these Draper <lb/>clusters is very similar to that reported for adaptive immune receptor clusters that form in B and <lb/>T cells (Kaizuka et al., 2007; Murugesan et al., 2016). To determine if Draper clusters have local <lb/>effects on the actin cytoskeleton, we co-expressed Draper-GFP and LifeAct-BFP and allowed <lb/>these cells to settle on PS bilayers. Draper-GFP microclusters appeared at the SLB interface <lb/>with LifeAct-BFP; as the clusters grew, LifeAct-BFP signal was depleted (Movie 3). The central <lb/>synapse was depleted of F-actin, as imaged by LifeAct-BFP. Thus, Draper activation at the <lb/>plasma membrane leads to clusters that undergo retrograde flow and correlates with local actin <lb/>cytoskeleton remodeling. <lb/>Next, we asked if Draper-GFP clusters are sites of recruitment for downstream signaling <lb/>molecules. Draper is proposed to interact with Shark, a dual SH2 protein, and an adapter Crk, <lb/>which harbors one SH2 and two SH3 domains. To test if these proteins are recruited to Draper <lb/>microclusters, we allowed Draper-GFP, Shark-TagBFP, Crk-mCherry transfected S2 cells to <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>settle on 10% PS bilayers and then imaged them by TIRF microscopy. Draper-GFP <lb/>microclusters co-localized with Shark-TagBFP and Crk-mCherry (Fig. 2E, Movie 4), indicating <lb/>that Draper-GFP microclusters, like TCR microclusters, recruit a tandem SH2-domain <lb/>containing kinase and an adapter protein to the plasma membrane. Crk and the activating <lb/>subunit of the PI3K p85 also co-localize at the synapse between PS bead and Draper-<lb/>expressing S2 cell, indicating that Draper may organize multiple signaling outputs (Fig. S1). Our <lb/>results demonstrate that upon ligation to PS, Draper is phosphorylated and nucleates formation <lb/>of signaling microclusters that recruit SH2-domain containing proteins. <lb/>Exclusion of a transmembrane phosphatase at the ligated membrane-membrane <lb/>interface <lb/>We next used our reconstitution system to understand the mechanism of how PS triggers <lb/>Draper phosphorylation. The T cell receptor is believed to be triggered by the exclusion of the <lb/>transmembrane phosphatase CD45, which has a bulky extracellular domain, from zones of <lb/>close membrane-membrane contact created by the pMHC-TCR interaction (Burroughs et al., <lb/>2006; Choudhuri et al., 2005; James and Vale, 2012). Since the Src family kinase Lck is <lb/>attached to the membrane inner leaflet and remains uniformly distributed after pMHC-TCR <lb/>engagement, phosphatase exclusion shifts the kinase-phosphatase balance towards net <lb/>receptor phosphorylation. We sought to test whether a similar mechanism might function to <lb/>trigger Draper phosphorylation. Drosophila S2 cells expresses several transmembrane <lb/>phosphatases (Fig. S2A). We tested the transmembrane phosphatase Ptp69D, because of its <lb/>high expression and similar domain structure to CD45 (extracellular fibronectin repeats and <lb/>cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. S2B)). To determine if Draper clusters are <lb/>segregated from Ptp69D, we co-transfected the two proteins with different fluorescent protein <lb/>tags and assessed localization during Draper ligation in living cells. Microscopy revealed that <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>ligated Draper-mCherry concentrated at the synapse between the S2 cell and PS bead, while <lb/>Ptp69D-GFP was partially excluded from this zone (Fig. 3A). Draper microclusters that formed <lb/>at the interface between an S2 cell and a PS-containing supported lipid bilayer also excluded <lb/>Ptp69D (Fig. S2C). Thus, ligated Draper is able to segregate away from an abundant <lb/>transmembrane phosphatase, a result that is consistent with a kinetic segregation triggering <lb/>mechanism. <lb/>In the kinetic segregation model, two opposing membranes are brought into close apposition by <lb/>the binding energy between receptor and its ligand, which results in the exclusion of larger <lb/>transmembrane phosphatases. To further examine whether Draper may trigger phosphorylation <lb/>through a kinetic segregation mechanism rather than a receptor conformational change, we <lb/>tested whether the extracellular domain of Draper and its ligand PS could be replaced with an <lb/>artificial receptor-ligand pair. Previous studies on the T cell receptor triggering showed that the <lb/>extracellular domain of the TCR and pMHC could be substituted with FKBP and FRB, which <lb/>upon addition of rapamycin to bridge FKBP and FRB, would trigger TCR phosphorylation <lb/>(James and Vale, 2012). We created a similar inducible system for Draper by replacing its <lb/>extracellular domain with FRB (FRB-EXT-Draper-INT) and replacing PS with His 10 -FKBP, which <lb/>was bound to the SLB on the bead via a NiNTA-lipid (Fig 3B). In the absence of rapamycin, <lb/>beads were engulfed at very low levels (0.003 beads/cell). However, in the presence of <lb/>rapamycin, the engineered receptor promoted robust engulfment of FKBP-bearing beads (Fig. <lb/>3C, Movie 5). Live cell microscopy revealed that the FRB-EXT-Draper-INT concentrated at the <lb/>cell-bead interface and recruited Shark kinase, suggesting that the chimeric receptor, like <lb/>Draper, is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig 3D). When His 10 -FKBP was attached to a <lb/>SLB on a coverslip, the cells spread on the surface. Like Draper-GFP, FRB-EXT-Draper-INT <lb/>excluded the phosphatase Ptp69D-GFP (Fig. 3E), consistent with a kinetic segregation-based <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>triggering mechanism. Thus a chimeric receptor that is designed to interact with a non-<lb/>physiological ligand is functional for engulfment. <lb/>Roles of Draper&apos;s cytoplasmic Tyr residues for engulfment of PS beads <lb/>We next sought to determine which Tyr residues are essential for full Draper activity. The <lb/>Draper tail domain contains an ITAM motif (YxxI/Lx 6-12 YxxI/L), an NPxY motif thought to interact <lb/>CED-6 (Fujita et al., 2012), and 10 other tyrosine residues, 2 of which are in close proximity to <lb/>the transmembrane domain. First, we created a construct in which 11 of the 13 tyrosines were <lb/>mutated to alanine, leaving the two tyrosines that are immediately adjacent to the <lb/>transmembrane segment since they potentially could have a structural role. We then compared <lb/>phagocytic proficiency of cells transfected with Draper-Ala11-GFP mutant to full-length Draper-<lb/>GFP and GFP alone control (endogenous background phagocytosis). Consistent with a role for <lb/>Tyr phosphorylation on Draper to promote phagocytosis, Draper-Ala11-GFP ingested PS-beads <lb/>at levels that were comparable to the GFP control and ~15-fold below Draper-GFP cells after a <lb/>45 min incubation (Fig 4A). <lb/>Genetic studies in Drosophila indicated at Shark kinase is involved in Draper signaling <lb/>(Ziegenfuss et al., 2008), but the Draper ITAM, which recruits Shark, is also important for other <lb/>aspects of Draper function including migration to sites of damage (Evans et al., 2015). To test <lb/>the roles of the ITAM in our system, we mutated the 2 Tyr residues in the ITAM to Phe (Draper-<lb/>âITAM; residues in 4B) and assessed its ability to promote phagocytosis. Draper-âITAM <lb/>showed a kinetic delay and a lower number of beads ingested (Figure 4C) compared to wildtype <lb/>Draper, although, it still promoted phagocytosis to a greater extent than the effectively null <lb/>Draper-Ala11 construct. <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>We also tested if Draper&apos;s ITAM is sufficient to signal by adding back the ITAM tyrosines (Y934 <lb/>and Y949) to the null Ala-11 mutant. The Draper ITAM Only receptor promoted phagocytosis of <lb/>PS beads, but did so more slowly than wildtype and to a lesser extent than wildtype Draper. As <lb/>expected, the Draper ITAM was necessary and sufficient to recruit Shark kinase to the synapse <lb/>between S2 cell and PS bead (Fig. S3). Collectively, our mutational analyses suggest that both <lb/>Draper&apos;s ITAM plays a major role in signaling but that non-ITAM residues also contribute to full <lb/>receptor activity in engulfing PS beads. <lb/>Hierarchical multi-site Tyr phosphorylation in vitro <lb/>Using a biochemical system with purified components, we sought to test the role of the Draper&apos;s <lb/>ITAM domain on Shark binding and receptor phosphorylation. To detect binding between Shark <lb/>and Draper, we used a fluorescently-labeled tandem SH2 Shark construct (BG505-tSH2-Shark) <lb/>whose signal quenches upon binding to liposome-bound Draper (Hui and Vale, 2014) <lb/>(schematic Fig. 5A). With Src42a in solution and ATP added to trigger phosphorylation, we <lb/>observed a time-dependent quenching of Shark fluorescence as it bound to the phosphorylated <lb/>receptor (Fig. 5A, orange trace). Next we tested the Draper receptor with double tyrosine <lb/>mutation in its ITAM motif (Draper-âITAM). Draper-âITAM showed little or no recruitment of <lb/>Shark (Fig. 5A, blue trace). <lb/>Next, we tested the extent and order of Tyr phosphorylation events on Draper&apos;s cytoplasmic tail <lb/>in this biochemical assay. After a 30 min kinase reaction, immunoblotting with anti-<lb/>phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a noticeable shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Draper, <lb/>which is suggestive of phosphorylation on multiple Tyr residues (Fig. 5B). Remarkably, even <lb/>though the Draper Y934F/Y949F mutant contains 9 additional tyrosine residues, its <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>phosphorylation as detected by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting was minimal (5% of wildtype <lb/>Draper) in the same kinase reaction (Fig. 5B). <lb/>This result greatly diminished phosphorylation of the Draper Y934F/Y949F mutant could be due <lb/>to 1) only the ITAM domains are phosphorylated by Src42a, or 2) or that phosphorylation of the <lb/>ITAM motif is needed for the phosphorylation of non-ITAM in Draper&apos;s tail. To distinguish <lb/>between these possibilities, we performed 1D mass spectrometry. After a 4 min incubation with <lb/>Src42a, we observed that the first ITAM tyrosine (Y934) was phosphorylated; phosphorylation <lb/>on the second ITAM residue Y949 was not detected but the Y949 containing peptide was not <lb/>highly covered in our mass spec (Fig. 5C). In addition to Y934, we found several other residues <lb/>that were phosphorylated (Y858, Y888, Y901, Y905, and Y925). This result indicates that the <lb/>ITAM is not only target for Src42a. Src42a is the most likely candidate for Draper <lb/>phosphorylation based upon genetic studies (Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). However, we also <lb/>wanted to establish whether other Src family kinases behave in a similar way to Src42a with <lb/>respect to Draper phosphorylation. We tested Lck, a well-studied Src family kinase in immune <lb/>cells. Like Src42a, Lck readily phosphorylated Draper on Y888, Y901, Y905, Y925, and the <lb/>Y934 ITAM residue (but not Y858)(Figure S4). Similar to results with Src42a, for the Draper <lb/>Y934F/Y949F mutant, phosphorylation by Lck was greatly reduced to 4% of wildtype (Figure <lb/>S5). Collectively these results indicate that multiple Draper tyrosines are phosphorylated by Src <lb/>family kinases, and that phosphorylation of non-ITAM residues strongly depends upon ITAM <lb/>phosphorylation. A potential mechanism for sequential phosphorylation is described in the <lb/>Discussion. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we have reconstituted Draper-dependent engulfment of PS-coated beads in <lb/>Drosophila S2 cells and used this system, in conjunction with a liposome-based biochemical <lb/>assay, to elucidate the initial steps of the phagocytic signaling pathway. Our data reveal that <lb/>corpse clearance, a conserved process required to recognize and remove dying cells, bears <lb/>striking mechanistic similarity to mammalian adaptive immune systems, which defend against <lb/>non-self pathogens and cancer. <lb/>Figure 6 shows our working model for Draper triggering. We show that ligation to the lipid PS is <lb/>sufficient to promote Draper clustering and segregation away from a transmembrane <lb/>phosphatase (1). Spatial separation between ligated Draper clusters and transmembrane <lb/>phosphatases shifts a kinase-phosphatase balance in favor of receptor phosphorylation by <lb/>Src42a, Draper&apos;s cognate activating kinase (2). Receptor phosphorylation occurs in a <lb/>hierarchical manner: Draper&apos;s ITAM residues are required for full activation of the system, <lb/>possibly though direct recruitment of Src42a to Draper&apos;s ITAM via its own SH2 domain (2). <lb/>Phosphorylation of Draper&apos;s tail activates a downstream cytosolic signaling cascade, including <lb/>recruitment of effectors including Shark kinase (3). Receptor phosphorylation and adapter <lb/>recruitment result in activation of the actin cytoskeleton and the coupling of receptors to actin <lb/>retrograde flow (4). We note that others have described further downstream Draper signaling <lb/>outputs, including a positive feedback mechanism to increase expression levels of the receptor <lb/>itself (drpr) (Ziegenfuss et al., 2012) and upregulation of other factors, including matrix <lb/>metallopeptidase 1 (mmp1) (Purice et al., 2017) (4). <lb/>PS is an activating ligand for Draper <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>Draper is reported to recognize both PS (Tung et al., 2013) and the protein ligands Pretaporter <lb/>and DmCaBP1 (Kuraishi et al., 2009; Okada et al., 2012). For PS, Tung et al (2013) <lb/>demonstrated direct binding of PS to the extracellular domain of Draper. They also showed that <lb/>incubation of S2 cells with PS liposomes increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels on Draper, <lb/>but did not demonstrate a capability of engulfing liposomes. Here we extend this finding to <lb/>demonstrate that Draper over-expression and ligation to PS are necessary and sufficient to <lb/>promote efficient engulfment of beads coated with supported lipid bilayers (Fig. 1B). <lb/>Furthermore, PS is an activating ligand that triggers Draper clustering, localized tyrosine <lb/>phosphorylation, effector recruitment to mobile microclusters, and remodeling of the actin <lb/>cytoskeleton. These results provide strong evidence for direct binding of PS to Draper leading to <lb/>activation of a signaling pathway. The nature of the binding interaction is Our results do not rule <lb/>out a role for the protein ligands Pretaporter and DmCaBP1 that have been reported previously <lb/>to act as Draper ligands (Kuraishi et al., 2009; Okada et al., 2012). These additional ligands <lb/>may allow Draper to respond independently of PS in some contexts. <lb/>Mechanism of Draper triggering upon ligation <lb/>TCR and FcR activation are driven entirely by phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines. Shark kinase, <lb/>like ZAP70, binds specifically to the ITAM motif, and we show that ITAM phosphorylation plays <lb/>an important role in signaling. However, unlike the TCR, Draper contains non-ITAM tyrosines, <lb/>and our kinetic assay for phagocytosis shows that non-ITAM tyrosines play a role in the full <lb/>activation of Draper. Our results are consistent with reports that both ITAM and non-ITAM <lb/>residues on Draper contribute to signaling (Fujita et al., 2012; Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). The <lb/>phosphorylated non-ITAM tyrosines in Draper may bind additional SH2-containing adapter <lb/>proteins-further studies will be needed to identify additional direct binding partners of the <lb/>phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail domain of Draper besides Shark. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>Our in vitro results with a completely biochemically defined system also reveal that Draper&apos;s <lb/>ITAM domain is required for the phosphorylation of the non-ITAM tyrosines. This result indicates <lb/>a sequential mechanism for multisite phosphorylation on Draper. One model for how this might <lb/>occur is through the direct recruitment of Src family kinases to the phosphorylated ITAM domain <lb/>of Draper. The kinase (e.g. Src42a) has a higher specificity for the tyrosines in Draper&apos;s ITAM, <lb/>domain and phosphorylates these residues first. Once phosphorylated, Src42a then can bind to <lb/>the phosphorylated ITAM through its own SH2 domain; while bound to Draper, the kinase can <lb/>phosphorylate non-ITAM residues on Draper. A mechanism in which a kinase creates its own <lb/>binding site before modifying other residues has been suggested for both Src-dependent <lb/>phosphorylation of synthetic ITAM-containing substrate peptides (Pellicena et al., 1998) and <lb/>phosphorylation of p130 CAS by Abl kinase (Mayer et al., 1995). A similar phenomenon was <lb/>observed for Lck-dependent modification of sequential ITAM residues on the T cell receptor, <lb/>which is required for full activation of this receptor (Lewis et al., 1997). Thus, in common with <lb/>other signaling systems, Draper phosphorylation involves a hierarchal phosphorylation of <lb/>tyrosines in its tail domain and this hierarchal phosphorylation is required for full receptor <lb/>activation. <lb/>Our findings also may shed light on mechanism of action for phagocytic receptors in organisms <lb/>beyond the fly. Mammalian glial cells encode a Draper ortholog Megf10, a predicted single pass <lb/>transmembrane protein with putative ITAMs that recruit Syk kinase (Scheib et al., 2012). <lb/>Though mechanistic differences likely exist between Draper and Megf10 as a consequence of <lb/>evolutionary divergence and distinct organismal requirements, Megf10&apos;s cytoplasmic tail <lb/>contains 12 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, only 4 of which comprise the putative ITAMs (Scheib <lb/>et al., 2012).

			<body>Comparison between Draper triggering and activation of mammalian immune receptors <lb/>A potential similarity between Draper and T cell signaling was first suggested by the finding of <lb/>an ITAM in the Draper cytoplasmic tail (Ziegenfuss et al., 2008). Our findings provide <lb/>mechanistic support of this idea. T cells are triggered via a kinetic segregation mechanism <lb/>governed by local shifting of a kinase-phosphatase equilibrium toward receptor phosphorylation <lb/>(Davis and van der Merwe, 2006). Briefly, apposition of a membrane-membrane interface at the <lb/>synapse between T cell and the antigen presenting cell (APC) results in the exclusion of the <lb/>bulky transmembrane phosphatase CD45. When local CD45 concentration is reduced below a <lb/>threshold, activity of the membrane-bound kinase Lck is favored. Lck phosphorylates the TCR <lb/>cytoplasmic ITAM motifs which in turn recruit ZAP70 kinase, an essential downstream kinase <lb/>involved in T cell activation (James and Vale, 2012). A similar segregation mechanism was <lb/>recently proposed to regulate FcR activation through creating an integrin-based diffusion barrier <lb/>that excludes CD45 (S. A. Freeman et al., 2016). <lb/>Here, we provide evidence that Draper may be activated through a kinetic segregation <lb/>mechanism. Draper ligation to PS results in the formation of microclusters that are transported <lb/>by the actin cytoskeleton. The behavior of these microclusters is very similar to that described <lb/>for the T cell receptor (Bunnell et al., 2002; Douglass and Vale, 2005; Varma et al., 2006). <lb/>Draper ligation to PS on a second membrane (either an apoptotic cells or an artificial membrane <lb/>composed of a supported lipid bilayer) also excludes a transmembrane phosphatase from the <lb/>synapse at the region of receptor phosphorylation and kinase recruitment (Fig. 3A). In the case <lb/>of T cells, a single transmembrane phosphatase (CD45) is highly expressed on the surface and <lb/>appears to be the dominant phosphatase in regulating signaling. However, phagocytic cells <lb/>likely express several transmembrane phosphatases, which together may contribute to <lb/></body>

			<body>regulating Draper and other phagocytic receptors. Draper is also regulated by at least one <lb/>cytosolic phosphatase, Corkscrew (Csw, SHP1/2), that is recruited to an alternative short splice <lb/>isoform of Draper, Draper-II (Logan et al., 2012), that encodes an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-<lb/>based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM). In the future, it will be important to determine how the specific <lb/>composition of phosphatases on the membrane (different sizes and expression levels) are used <lb/>to dampen and fine-tune the sensitivity of engulfment. <lb/>Synthetic engulfment receptors <lb/>Analogous to TCRs, the extracellular ligand and receptor for Draper can be functionally <lb/>replaced by other interacting modules such as FKBP-rapamycin-FRB. These chimeric receptors <lb/>create signaling zones for both Draper (Fig. 3E) and TCR (James and Vale, 2012). The ability to <lb/>replace the extracellular modules implies that Draper signaling does not require a ligand-<lb/>induced conformational change to the cytoplasmic tail, although the possibility that such <lb/>changes augment signaling cannot be excluded. Our ability to replace Draper and PS with a <lb/>synthetic FKBP-rapamycin-FRB module also provides a mechanistic basis to reprogram <lb/>engulfment signaling toward non-native targets. This idea is a conceptually similar to that of <lb/>chimeric T cell receptors that recognize cancer antigen to promote specific cell killing (Lim and <lb/>June, 2017). Collectively, we have revealed that understanding the fundamental cell biology and <lb/>biochemistry underlying early steps of Draper activation provide a mechanistic basis to <lb/>reprogram engulfment signaling. <lb/></body>

			<body>A. Schematic of liposome-FRET assay to detect direct binding between Draper&apos;s <lb/>phosphorylated tail and SH2-domain containing reporter proteins.

Briefly, when a BG505-labeled reporter protein comes into close proximity to a <lb/>rhodamine labeled liposome, the 505 nm fluorescence signal is quenched.

			<body>(1) Draper ligation to PS on a cell corpse creates an exclusion zone where ligated receptors <lb/>cluster at the synapse and unligated molecules such as bulky transmembrane phosphatases <lb/>segregate away from receptors. (2) Spatial segregation between receptors and inhibitory <lb/>phosphatases shifts the balance towards receptor phosphorylation by Src42a, a reaction <lb/>strikingly similar to triggering of TCRs by the kinase Lck. Src42a first phosphorylates Draper&apos;s <lb/>ITAM and then modifies non-ITAM Tyr residues that also contribute to signaling. (3) Tyr <lb/>phosphorylation on Draper&apos;s tail recruits cytosolic effector proteins including the kinase Shark in <lb/>a manner similar to recruitment of the kinase ZAP70 to triggered TCRs. (4) Effector recruitment <lb/>to phosphorylated Draper molecules promotes signaling outputs including cytoskeletal <lb/>remodeling and engulfment. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Note: See the completed KEY RESOURCES TABLE for supplier and catalog information <lb/>Contact for Reagent and Resource Sharing <lb/>Requests for further information and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the <lb/>corresponding author, Ronald D. Vale (ron.vale@ucsf.edu). <lb/>Experimental Model and Subject Details <lb/>Drosophila S2 Cell Culture <lb/>Drosophila S2U cells were cultured in Schneider&apos;s media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal <lb/>Bovine Serum (FBS, Atlanta) and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). S2 cells were grown in non-<lb/>vented T25 or T75 flasks (Corning) and split every 3-6 days from high density cultures (~50-<lb/>80%). S2U cells were not split to below ~25% confluency as S2U cells are unhappy at low <lb/>density. Healthy S2U cells adhere gently to the surface of the culture dish rather than floating, <lb/>but can be split by gently resuspending the adhered cells using a tissue culture pipet and a 10 <lb/>ml sterile tissue culture pipet. Enzymatic dissociation using trypsin or by scraping is <lb/>unnecessary for S2U cells. Frozen stocks were prepared regularly. S2U freeze media is: 45% <lb/>fresh complete media, 45% sterile filtered conditioned media prepared after spinning the media <lb/>for 5 min at 1000 x g, and 10% DMSO (Sigma). A confluent T75 dish of S2U cells was pelleted <lb/>for 5 min at 1000 x g, resuspended in 10 ml of freeze media (described above) and split as 1 ml <lb/>aliquots in externally-threaded cryotubes (Corning), stored at -80 o C in a cell freezing apparatus <lb/></body>

			<body>containing isopropyl alcohol, and transferred to long term storage in liquid nitrogen, vapor <lb/>phase. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma using the MycoAlert kit (Lonza). <lb/>Method Details <lb/>Transfection of Drosophila S2U Cells <lb/>Cells were split to ~60% confluency into 6 well tissue culture dishes 4 to 12 hr prior to <lb/>transfection. All transfection mixes were prepared in 5 ml low-retention polystyrene round-<lb/>bottom tubes. To prepare transfection mixes a maximum of 2.5 Âµg plasmid DNA was added to <lb/>300 Âµl serum-free Schneider&apos;s media and gently mixed. 5 Âµl of TransIT-Insect (Mirus) was <lb/>added to diluted DNA and gently mixed. At this point the solution appears cloudy. Transfection <lb/>mixes were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and added drop-wise gently to the 6 well <lb/>plate using a p1000 pipet. After drop-wise addition of transfection mixes, the plate was gently <lb/>shaken laterally to ensure even distribution of TransIT-DNA particles. Transfection efficiencies <lb/>of at least 50% and up to 90% were regularly obtained using this method, an improvement <lb/>compared to other transient transfection methods employed for Drosophila S2U cells. <lb/>All constructs used in this study express proteins of interest in S2U cells were under control of a <lb/>pMT copper-inducible promoter. To induce expression in transfected cells, CuSO 4 was added <lb/>from a 50 mM sterile stock in water to a final concentration of 250 ÂµM (1 to 200 dilution from <lb/>stock) 36 to 48 hr after transfection. The timing of induction is important -at this later time point, <lb/>we find expression levels to be lower and more uniform. At shorter time points (e.g. 12 to 24 hr <lb/>after transfection), transfection efficiency was lower and expression levels in transfected cells <lb/>higher, as assessed by live cell imaging of fluorescent proteins under control of the pMT <lb/>promoter. <lb/></body>

			<body>Preparation of APC Annexin V Labeled Apoptotic Cell Corpses <lb/>To prepare labeled apoptotic cell corpses for use in internalization assays, 1 ÂµM final <lb/>concentration of Actinomycin D (Sigma; 1 mg/ml in DMSO, 833 ÂµM stock) was added directly to <lb/>80% confluent cultures of Drosophila S2U cells in 6 well plates. Cells were incubated for 16 hr in <lb/>Actinomycin D prior to harvesting by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 x g a 15 ml falcon tube. <lb/>Actinomycin D was washed out by rinsing corpses twice in complete Schenider&apos;s media in the <lb/>same falcon tube -sequential washes, each with 10 ml complete media were performed. <lb/>Corpses from 1 well of a 6 well dish were resuspended in 300 Âµl of complete media after <lb/>washes and transferred to a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube for labeling. To label externalized <lb/>phosphatidylserine (PS), APC Annexin V (BioLegend) was added directly to the washed <lb/>corpses to a final concentration of 50 ng/ul (from 5 Âµg/ml stock). The tube was wrapped in foil <lb/>prior to labeling on a rotator at room temperature for 30 min. After labeling, cells were washed 3 <lb/>times by sequential harvesting and resuspension in complete media. After washing labeled <lb/>corpses were resuspended in 300 Âµl complete media. <lb/>Assay for Internalization of Apoptotic Cell Corpses <lb/>To assess internalization of apoptotic cell corpses, washed Draper-GFP or mCherry-control <lb/>transfected S2U cells were incubated with labeled cell corpses prepared as above.

To prepare 10 molar % beads, chloroform suspended lipids sufficient for 1 <lb/>ml of a 10 mM solution were mixed at the following proportions: 89.5% POPC, 10% DOPS, <lb/>0.5% PEG5000-PE, 0.5% atto390-DOPE (label for visualization by microscopy). Lipids were <lb/>transferred to a chloroform-washed glass vial using gas-tight Hamilton syringes and dried to a <lb/>film under argon gas in a warm (~45 o C) water bath. Dried lipids were stored under foil (if <lb/>labeled lipids were used) and desiccated overnight at room temperature in a benchtop <lb/>desiccator filled with Drierite. Dried lipids were suspended in 1 ml tissue culture grade PBS by <lb/>vortexing for 1 min under parafilm and gentle pipetting. Suspended lipids were transferred to a <lb/>1.7 ml Eppendorf tube and stored under argon gas. The PBS-lipid mix was freeze/thawed 5 <lb/>times in liquid nitrogen/warm water and subjected to 2 x 5 min sonication in a Bioruptor Pico <lb/>bath sonicator (Diagenode). Sonicated lipids were spin at 35000 rpm for 35 min at 4 o C in a TLA <lb/>120.1 rotor in a benchtop Beckman ultracentrifuge. Only a small pellet should be visible after <lb/>spinning sonicated lipids. Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs) prepared using this method were <lb/>used immediately or stored under argon gas, flash frozen, and stored at -80 o C. Lipid mixes are <lb/>best used within two weeks of preparation. Undiluted 10 mM lipid mixes were used as described <lb/>below to build bilayers on silica beads. For the PS titration in Figure 1G differences in PS <lb/>concentration were made up by balanced changes to the molar % of PC such that final lipid <lb/>concentration in 1 ml PBS matched the 10 mM concentration described above. <lb/></body>

Beads in suspension were pelleted 3 times in 300 Âµl Milli-Q <lb/>water at 300 rcf and decanted. After the third wash, beads were resuspended in ~30 Âµl PBS <lb/>until the pellet was barely covered. 300 Âµl of 2 mM final concentration of the desired lipid mix <lb/>(diluted from 10 mM stock in PBS) was vortexed briefly, wrapped in foil, and rotated at room <lb/>temperature for 45 min. Beads were pelleted and washed 3 times by sequential pelleting and <lb/>resuspension in 300 Âµl fresh PBS. Washed beads were resuspended in 300 Âµl fresh PBS for <lb/>bead assay, described below. <lb/>Assay for Internalization of PS-coated Silica Beads <lb/>To assess internalization of PS-coated silica beads, 7 Âµl of bead suspension was mixed with <lb/>300 Âµl washed transfected S2U cells, flipped gently to mix 4 times, and the complete mixture <lb/>plated in 1 well of a 96-well glass bottomed MatriPlate imaging dish (Brooks).

His 10 -FKBP was diluted to 10 <lb/>nM final concentration in PBS + 0.1% w/v BSA and 300 Âµl of this dilution was added to each 50 <lb/>Âµl bead pellet, as described above.

			<body>Building PS-containing Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs) <lb/>The night before the experiment, a 96 well MatriCal imaging plate was submerged in 2% v/v <lb/>Hellmanex III, microwaved for 2.5 min on full power, and set on a stir plate under saran wrap for <lb/>at least 12 hr. Hellmanex was washed away through 20 sequential washes using Milli-Q water <lb/>and the washed plate dried under Nitrogen gas. The dried plate was covered in thermal paper <lb/>using a roller. The desired number of wells were exposed using a razor and washed 3 x 5 min <lb/>5N NaOH. After NaOH washes, wells were cleaned 10 times with MilliQ water. <lb/>To prepare 10% PS bilayers, 250 Âµl 2 mM lipid mix in PBS described above gently pipetted on <lb/>the glass surface. The lipid mix was pipetted up and down and bilayer formation was allowed to <lb/>proceed for 30 min at room temperature. After bilayers formed, washes were performed using <lb/>PBS 3 x 5 min. For each wash, PBS was gently pipetted up and down over the surface of the <lb/>bilayer to remove SUVs not part of the SLB. Bilayers were washed into serum free Schneider&apos;s <lb/>media prior to adding cells. Imaging on bilayers should be complete within 45 min for best <lb/>results, as bilayer integrity cannot be assumed after this time. <lb/>After washing the SLB, 150 Âµl of washed cells were added to the surface, allowed to settle, and <lb/>imaged by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence-Microscopy as described below. A lower <lb/>density of cells can be used, as cells will spread on bilayers and imaging overlapping cells is not <lb/>ideal. <lb/>Building His 10 -FKBP Bearing Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs) <lb/></body>

			<body>Bilayers were prepared as above with the exception that the following lipid mix was used (note <lb/>the use of DGS-NTA-Nickel lipid to ligate His 10 proteins to the bilayer): 97% POPC, 2% DGS-<lb/>NTA-Nickel, 0.5% PEG5000-PE, 0.5% atto390-DOPE or 0.5% atto647-DOPE for labeling, <lb/>depending on the fluorescent proteins present on fusion proteins assessed. Washed bilayers <lb/>were blocked in PBS + 0.1% w/v BSA for 15 min prior to protein coupling. To couple His 10 -FKBP <lb/>to 2% DGS-NTA-doped bilayers, His 10 -FKBP was diluted to 10 nM final concentration in PBS + <lb/>0.1% w/v BSA and added to SLBs to couple for 40 min at room temperature. Uncoupled protein <lb/>was washed 3 x 5 min under foil at room temperature prior to adding cells as above with the <lb/>exception that when FKBP ligand was used with receptors fused to FRB-extracellular domains, <lb/>1 ÂµM rapamycin was added to form the 100 fM FRB-rapamycin-FKBP ternary complex. <lb/>Liposome FRET Assay for Effector Recruitment to Phosphorylated Receptor Tails <lb/>This assay was based upon one used to reconstitute mammalian T cell signaling (Hui and Vale, <lb/>2014). To present receptor tails in physiological geometry for phosphorylation by Src-family <lb/>kinases, 1 ÂµM His 10 receptor tails (either His 10 -Draper-INT or His 10 -Draper-ÎITAM-INT) were <lb/>ligated to liposomes comprised of the following molar percent: 74.5% POPC, 10% DGS-NTA, <lb/>0.5% Rhodamine-PE, 15% DOPS. Liposomes were prepared using an extruder with 200 nm <lb/>filters (Avanti). Receptor tails and 1 nM His 10 -Lck-Y505F or 86 nM Src42a (soluble) were <lb/>equilibrated with receptor tails in the presence of BG505-kinase-tSH2 reporter proteins were <lb/>incubated. After proteins were allowed to bind for 40 min at room temperature in the dark. At <lb/>this point, Mg-ATP was added to a 1 mM final concentration and BG505 signal was assessed at <lb/>indicated time points. Quenching of BG505 signal, dependent upon addition of ATP, indicates <lb/>recruitment of reporters to phosphorylated receptor tails.

Quantification of anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-his intensity was performed using the <lb/>Gel Analysis feature of Fiji. <lb/>Protein Expression, Purification, and Labeling <lb/>His 10 -Draper and His 10 -Draper-ÎITAM were transformed into BL-21 DE3 RIPL cells (Agilent). <lb/>Cells were grown in Terrific Broth (TB), 12 g tryptone, 24 g yeast extract, 4 ml glycerol up to 1L <lb/>in MilliQ water + 10% v/v sterile salt solution in MilliQ water: 0.17M KH 2 PO 4 , 0.72 M K 2 HPO 4 , <lb/>until cells reached an OD 280 of ~0.6-0.8, chilled in a 4 o C room, and induced overnight by <lb/>addition of 0.5 mM final concentration of IPTG. Protein expression was performed in shaker set <lb/>to 18 o C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM <lb/>NaCl, 1 tablet Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet crushed per 100 ml buffer). Lysates <lb/>were prepared by probe sonication and bound to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). Beads were <lb/>washed extensively with lysis buffer and proteins eluted in 500 mM imidazole in lysis buffer. <lb/>Imidazole elutions were subjected to gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/30 <lb/>column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% <lb/>glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. Monomer fractions were pooled, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and <lb/>stored in small aliquots at -80 o C. Soluble Src42a was purified from SF9 cells as a GST-(PP)-<lb/>SNAP-Src42a fusion where PP indicates a cut site for Precission Protease. Precission Protease <lb/>cleavage was performed overnight and post-cleavage supernatants were gel filtered as <lb/></body>

			<body>described below. His 10 -Lck Y505F was purified from SF9 cells over Nickel agarose (Qiagen) <lb/>and eluted in 500 mM imidazole in lysis buffer. Both Src family kinases were subjected to gel <lb/>filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration <lb/>buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. Monomer <lb/>fractions were pooled, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in small aliquots at -80 o C. The <lb/>tandem SH2 domain reporter for Shark kinase was cloned as a GST-(PP)-SNAP-Shark-tSH2 <lb/>fusion where PP indicates a cut site for Precission Protease. The soluble SNAP-Shark-tSH2 <lb/>reporter was generated by on-resin cleavage with Precission Protease during purification. GST-<lb/>Precission Protease remained on the beads. Cleavage products were subjected to gel filtration <lb/>chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer: 50 <lb/>mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. To prepare BG505-labeled <lb/>SNAP-Shark-tSH2 for the liposome FRET assay, 10 ÂµM cleaved, gel filtered monomer was <lb/>incubated at a 1:2 molar ratio with SNAP-Cell 505 Star (NEB) overnight in the dark at 4 o C and <lb/>run over a PD Minitrap G-25 column (GE Healthcare) to eliminate excess dye. <lb/>Spinning Disk Confocal Microscopy <lb/>All internalization and bead co-localization imaging performed for this study was done of a <lb/>spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with a Yokogawa <lb/>spinning disk). For bead internalization kinetic assays images were acquired using a 40x/0.95 <lb/>N/A air objective. Live image acquisition for internalization of corpses and beads was performed <lb/>using the High Content Screening (HCS) Site Generator plugin in ÂµManager. All other images <lb/>were acquired using a 100x 1.49 N/A oil immersion objective. Images were captured using an <lb/>Andor iXon EM-CCD camera. The open source ÂµManager software package was used to run <lb/>the microscope and capture the images. <lb/></body>

			<body>Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence-Microscopy (TIRF-M) <lb/>All SLB imaging was performed using a TIRF microscope equipped with a motorized TIRF arm <lb/>and a Hamamatsu Flash 4 camera. For all TIRF-M imaging images were captured at 2 x 2 <lb/>binning. The open source ÂµManager software package was used to run the microscope and <lb/>capture the images (Edelstein et al., 2010). <lb/>Imaging processing and analysis <lb/>All image quantification was done on raw, unprocessed images. All images in figures were <lb/>opened in ImageJ. A middle z-slice was extracted and the channels split. The image intensities <lb/>were scaled to enhance contrast in Photoshop (Adobe) using appropriate levels of linear <lb/>adjustment. Background correction was not performed. Where mutants are compared in the <lb/>same series, images are acquired using identical microscope and camera settings and scaled to <lb/>equal intensity values. <lb/>Quantification and Statistical Analysis <lb/>For both corpse internalization and bead internalization assays, targets were scored as <lb/>internalized following complete engulfment of the object, as assessed by visible mCherry-CAAX <lb/>or receptor-GFP signal visible completely around the target in stills from live imaging. Beads or <lb/>corpses attached but not internalized were not scored. Only targets with labeled Annexin V or <lb/>atto390 visible were scored as internalized. At least 150 cells per condition are shown. Mean <lb/>value and Â± one standard deviation are plotted (GraphPad 6.0). <lb/></body>
