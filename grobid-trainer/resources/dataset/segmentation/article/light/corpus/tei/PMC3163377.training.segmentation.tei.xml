			<body>Introduction <lb/>Management of inflammatory disorders involves a stepwise approach to the use of <lb/>therapeutic agents. Relieving of pain and reduction of inflammation are urgent goals to <lb/>reduce the severity of symptoms. A generally accepted stepwise approach to treat the <lb/>inflammation disorders includes physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs <lb/>(NSAIDs), disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids and finally, <lb/>immunosuppressive agents [1, 2]. However, NSAIDs remain among the most widely <lb/>prescribed drugs worldwide; they have been generally considered as inhibitors of <lb/>cyclooxygenases (COXs) [3, 4]. Most of NSAIDs act by reducing prostaglandin <lb/>biosynthesis through the inhibition of the COX reaction [5]. Moreover, data have been <lb/>accumulating through the years suggesting that NSAIDs also probably act on other targets <lb/>to counteract pain. In spite of their beneficial action, their activity is associated with <lb/>deleterious side effects, and continuous administration of these drugs leads to <lb/>nephrotoxicity and gastric ulcerations. The therapeutic anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs <lb/>is produced by inhibition of COX-2, while the unwanted side effects arise from the <lb/>inhibition of COX-1 activity. It is estimated that 25% of patients using NSAIDs experience <lb/>some kind of side effect and about 5% develop serious health consequence (massive GI <lb/>bleed, acute renal failure, etc.). Consequently, extensive research has been directed <lb/>towards improving their pharmacological profile [6]. <lb/>Recently, a novel class of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been discovered. Among this <lb/>class, celecoxib (Figure 1), the potent and gastrointestinal (GI) safe anti-inflammatory <lb/>agent. It is considered a typical model of sulphonamide-based diarylpyrazole template that <lb/>is known to selectively inhibit COX-2 [7-15]. Furthermore, several arylpyrazoles are <lb/>available as anti-inflammatory drugs in market such as valdecoxib [16], rofecoxib [17], <lb/>etoricoxib [18, 19]. SC-558, diarylpyrazole derivative (Figure 1), was found to be a <lb/>marvelous inhibitor with 1900-fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. In addition, both SC-<lb/>558 and celecoxib were published, co-crystallized with the active site of COX-2, with many <lb/>investigations about their mechanism of action and selectivity to COX-2 [20-22]. <lb/>Celecoxib <lb/>6a-c R = Me; R 1 = SO 2 -Ph; <lb/>X = H, 3-Me, 4-Me <lb/>10a-f R = Me, -CH=CH-Ph(-C 6 H 4 -OMe); <lb/>R 1 = SO 2 -Ph; X = H, 3-Me, 4-Me <lb/>7a-c R = Me; R 1 = -CN; X = H, 3-Me, 4-Me <lb/>11a-f R = Me, -CH=CH-Ph(-C 6 H 4 -OMe); <lb/>R 1 = -CN; X = H, 3-Me, 4-Me <lb/>SC-558 <lb/>X <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>R <lb/>1 <lb/>O <lb/>R <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>F 3 C <lb/>SO 2 NH 2 <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Br <lb/>F 3 C <lb/>SO 2 NH 2 <lb/>Fig. 1. <lb/>Structure of Celecoxib, SC-558, 6a-c, 10a-f, 7a-c and 11a-f. <lb/></body>

			<body>In view of the above facts and in continuation of our interest in the synthesis of bioactive <lb/>heterocycles, especially pyrazole derivatives [23-32], we report here some di/triaryl-<lb/>pyrazoles having phenylsulphone or carbonitrile moiety (Figure 1). The anti-inflammatory <lb/>activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated. Moreover, molecular docking <lb/>studies of active compounds were carried out to rationalize their activity. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Chemistry <lb/>Cyclization reaction of hydrazonoyl chlorides 1a-c with 1-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)-<lb/>ethanone (2) in ethanolic sodium ethoxide solution at room temperature furnished <lb/>1-(5-phenyl-4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-aryl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)ethanones <lb/>(6a-c), <lb/>respectively <lb/>(Scheme 1). The latter pyrazoles were reacted with benzaldehyde or 4-anisaldehyde in <lb/>ethanol containing 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide at room temperature to afford <lb/>chalcones 7a-f. The IR spectra of the latter chalcones showed, in each case, the <lb/>appearance of absorption band in the region 1640-1676 cm -1 corresponding to the <lb/>carbonyl function. Their 1 H NMR spectra showed the disappearance of COCH 3 protons <lb/>signal and displayed the signals of olefinic protons in the aromatic region. <lb/>1,6 Ar <lb/>a <lb/>Ph <lb/>b <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>c <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>Ph <lb/>S Ph <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>7a-f <lb/>3 <lb/>1a-c <lb/>6a-c <lb/>2 <lb/>4a-c <lb/>5a-c <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>Ph <lb/>S Ph <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>Me <lb/>N <lb/>N Ar <lb/>O <lb/>Cl <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>Ph <lb/>S <lb/>O <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>Me <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>Ph <lb/>S <lb/>O <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>Ar <lb/>1 <lb/>O <lb/>Na <lb/>+ <lb/>Ph <lb/>S <lb/>Me <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>N NH <lb/>Ar <lb/>-H 2 O <lb/>7 <lb/>Ar <lb/>Ar 1 <lb/>a <lb/>Ph <lb/>Ph <lb/>b <lb/>Ph <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>c <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 Ph <lb/>d <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>e <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 Ph <lb/>f <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>I <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>Me <lb/>Ph <lb/>OH <lb/>S <lb/>O <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>H <lb/>Sch. 1.

			<body>Similarly, the reaction of 3-acetyl-(1-aryl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitriles (10a-c) <lb/>with benzaldehyde or 4-anisaldehyde, under the same reaction conditions for synthesis of <lb/>7a-f, afforded the corresponding chalcones 11a-f, respectively (Scheme 2). The structure <lb/>of the latter chalcones was confirmed under the basis of their spectral data. For example, <lb/>their IR spectra revealed the appearance of absorption band in the region 1662-1668 cm -1 <lb/>due to the carbonyl group in addition to the appearance of sharp absorption peak of <lb/>carbonitrile function around 2235 cm -1 and their mass spectra showed, in each case, a <lb/>peak corresponding to their molecular ion. <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>9 <lb/>8 <lb/>1a-c <lb/>(b) <lb/>10a-c <lb/>11a-f <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>O <lb/>Me <lb/>Ph <lb/>N <lb/>Me <lb/>N <lb/>N Ar <lb/>O <lb/>Cl <lb/>H <lb/>Ph <lb/>O <lb/>N <lb/>1,10 Ar <lb/>a <lb/>Ph <lb/>b <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>c <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>11 <lb/>Ar <lb/>Ar 1 <lb/>a <lb/>Ph <lb/>Ph <lb/>b <lb/>Ph <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>c <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 Ph <lb/>d <lb/>3-MeC 6 H 4 4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>e <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 Ph <lb/>f <lb/>4-MeC 6 H 4 4-MeC 6 H 4 <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>O <lb/>Ph <lb/>N <lb/>Ar <lb/>1 <lb/>Na <lb/>+ <lb/>I <lb/>-<lb/>(a) <lb/>Sch. 2.

			<body>From the structure activity relationship (SAR) viewpoint, the anti-inflammatory activity of <lb/>phenylsulfonylpyrazoles such as 6a, 6c, 7b and 7d were found to be higher than that of <lb/>carbonitrile pyrazoles except 10a which achieved a greater activity. Additionally, the <lb/>introducing of chalcone moiety to pyrazole ring was found to be variable in effectiveness of <lb/>activity. However, these results imply that the phenyl sulphone moiety and carbonyl group <lb/>attached to the pyrazole system is an essential pharmacophore responsible for activity. <lb/>Furthermore, changing the position of 4-methyl substituent of N-phenyl ring in 6c to <lb/>position 3 in 6b increased the activity. On the other hand, the phenylsulphonylpyrazoles <lb/>that contains 4-methoxybenzylidine group, 7b and 7d, showed a higher activity while that <lb/>with benzylidine group, 7a and 7c, have no activity. Taken together, the results of 6a-c and <lb/>7a-f provide evidence that the structural features of arylidine moieties and changes in the <lb/>N-aryl group significantly affects their anti-inflammatory activity. <lb/>Ulcerogenic effects <lb/>The most active compounds 6b, 7b, 7d and 10a were selected for the <lb/>ulcerogenic study as compared to the reference drugs meloxicam and <lb/>indomethacin [33]. Compound 6b showed lower ulceration (1.5) respect to meloxicam <lb/>(1.67) or to indomethacin (3.17) while compounds 7b, and 7d recorded ulcer <lb/>index higher than meloxicam but still lower than indomethacin; compound <lb/>10a showed the highest ulcer index (2.83) (Table 2). <lb/>Tab. 2. <lb/>Ulcer index of indomethacin, meloxicam, 6b, 7b, 7d and 10a. <lb/>Compound <lb/>Ulcer index a <lb/>Control <lb/>0.25 ± 0.274 <lb/>6b <lb/>1.5 ± 1.000 <lb/>7b <lb/>2 ± 0.894 b <lb/>7d <lb/>1.83 ± 0.983 <lb/>10a <lb/>2.83 ± 0.753 c <lb/>Meloxicam <lb/>1.67 ± 0.817 <lb/>Indomethacin <lb/>3.17 ± 0.753 c <lb/>a Values represent means ± SD (n = 6); <lb/>Significance level b, P &lt; 0.05; c, P &lt; 0.01 <lb/>as compared with the respective control. <lb/>Molecular docking <lb/>The docking runs were conducted using Molsoft ICM-pro software to rationalize the <lb/>obtained biological results. Besides, the molecular docking studies helped in <lb/>understanding the various interactions between the ligand and enzyme active sites. An <lb/>automated docking study was carried out using the crystal structure of COX-2 (pdb ID: <lb/>1CX2) in which SC-558 co-crystallized as a ligand [20]. Both enzymes were submitted to <lb/>regularization process to fit the protein model with the ideal covalent geometry of residues <lb/>to the atom positions of a target PDB structure [34]. The regularized protein was used in <lb/>determination of the important amino acids in ligand binding pocket (LBP) of COX-2 <lb/>enzyme. <lb/></body>

			<body>Re-docking of the SC-558 was done to investigate its interaction with active site of COX-2 <lb/>enzyme. Binding mode of SC-558 showed the binding of bromophenyl ring in a <lb/>hydrophobic cavity by Gly526, Leu384, Tyr385, Trp387, Met522, Phe518, Val523 and <lb/>Ser530 interaction (Figure 2). The trifluoromethyl group was bounded in an adjacent <lb/>pocket by Val116, Tyr355, Leu359 and Leu531. The sulphonamide group extends into a <lb/>relatively polar region and interacts with His90, Arg513, Gln192, Leu352 and Ser353 <lb/>[20, 35]. Interactive docking using Mol table ligand was carried out for all the conformers of <lb/>all of the tested compounds with remarked biological activity to the selected active site of <lb/>COX-2. Each docked compound was assigned by a score according to its fitting to LBP <lb/>and its binding mode with different amino acid residues that have a role in its biological <lb/>activity (Table 3). <lb/>Fig. 2. <lb/>Binding mode of SC-558 with COX-2 active site.

In <lb/>addition, the acetyl group was imbedded in the hydrophobic pocket of Phe518, Ala516, <lb/>Ser353 and Leu352. In addition, the m-methyl substituent in 6b was surrounded by a <lb/>pocket of Gly526, Tyr385 and Trp387. <lb/></body>

			<body>Next, the binding mode of interaction of compound 10a overlaid with SC-558 revealed the <lb/>same alignment with SC-558. Nevertheless, compound 10a showed a deficient of <lb/>sulphonamide binding mode (Figure 4). Compounds 7b and 7d gave good binding scores <lb/>and binding modes with different amino acids in the receptor of COX-2 respect to their <lb/>biological activity. <lb/>Fig. 4. <lb/>Overlay of SC-558 (green) and 10a (orange) inside the active site of COX-2. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>In conclusion, we described a facile synthesis of poly-functionally pyrazoles. Some of <lb/>synthesized pyrazoles showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity. 1-(5-Phenyl-<lb/>4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-(3-tolyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)ethanone (6b) possessed a high activity, <lb/>when compared with reference drugs, with lower gastrointestinal (GI) profiles while <lb/>compounds 7b, 7d and 10a have a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. Molecular docking <lb/>study gave us good information about the interaction mode of sulfone-based pyrazoles <lb/>with COX-2 active site. They have the ability to make hydrogen bonds with amino acid <lb/>residues Tyr355, His90 and Arg513 in COX-2 active site. <lb/>Experimental <lb/>Chemistry <lb/>Melting points (°C, uncorrected) were determined using a Gallenkamp melting point <lb/>apparatus.

			<body>University, Giza, Egypt. The IR spectra (KBr) were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT/IR <lb/>spectrometer. At 400 MHz, the NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol spectrometer using <lb/>tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. 1 H and 13 C spectra were run at 400 and 100 <lb/>MHz, respectively. Splitting patterns are designated as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, <lb/>triplet; m, multiplet. Chemical shift (δ) values are given in parts per million and coupling <lb/>constants (J) in Hertz. The mass spectra were performed using a Varian MAT CH-5 <lb/>spectrometer (70 eV). <lb/>1-(5-Phenyl-4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-aryl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)ethanone (6a-c) <lb/>1-Phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethanone (2) (2.6 g, 10 mmol) was added to a stirred ethanolic <lb/>sodium ethoxide solution [prepared from sodium metal (0.23 g, 10 mmol) and 50 mL of <lb/>absolute ethanol].

Normal rat <lb/>chow and water were made available. The tested compounds and the reference standards <lb/>were completely dissolved in DMSO. The administered oral dose of the tested compounds <lb/>was 10 mg/kg body weight with analogy of a reported procedure. Ninety rats were divided <lb/>into 15 groups each of six animals. All rats were deprived from food and water for 18 h <lb/>before the experiment and were injected orally by 5 mL water to avoid fluid variation during <lb/>the process of edema. Two groups received the reference standards; 12 groups received <lb/>the tested compounds dissolved in DMSO and one group left as negative control group <lb/>which given 0.2 mL DMSO by oral tube. Indomethacin was obtained from Nile Company <lb/>for Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industries, Cairo, Egypt and meloxicam was obtained <lb/>from Memphis Company for Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industries, Cairo, Egypt. The <lb/>tested compounds and meloxicam were given by oral route at doses of 10 mg/kg body <lb/>weight while indomethacin was given by oral rout at 5 mg/kg body weight. This dose of <lb/>indomethacin was considered as a positive control for experiments with any new chemical <lb/>entity [40]. Then, sublunary of 0.1 mL of 2% carrageenan sodium (Sigma, USA) was <lb/>injected in the right hind paw. The volume of the paw was measured immediately after <lb/>injection and after administration of the compounds at time intervals 3 and 6 h by using <lb/>Dial micrometer model (120-1206) Baty, Sussex, England). The results were expressed as <lb/>volume of edema at each time interval, percentage inhibition of edema volume at each <lb/>time with respect to control and potency which was calculated compared to indomethacin. <lb/></body>

			<body>Ulcerogenic effects <lb/>Ulcerogenic activity of meloxicam, indomethacin and tested compounds were studied in <lb/>Albino rats of wistar strain weighing 150-200 g of either sex and divided into seven groups <lb/>each of six animals. The first group served as control group treated with 0.2 mL DMSO. <lb/>Indomethacin was given by a dose of 5 mg/kg/day while the dose of meloxicam and other <lb/>tested compounds was 10 mg/kg/day. All groups were treated for three consecutive days <lb/>by oral tube. During three days of dosage treatment, the animals were starved for 18 h but <lb/>water was provided ad libitum. Food was allowed 2 hours post administration of the drugs. <lb/>Two hours following the last doses, rats were sacrificed. The stomach of each rat were <lb/>removed, opened along the greater curvature, rinsed with 0.9% sodium chloride (isotonic <lb/>solution) and stretched by pins on a cork board. The lesions in gastric mucosa were <lb/>determined by using stereoscopic microscope. Hemorrhagic lesions were evaluated by <lb/>scores: 0.0, Normal (no injury, bleeding and latent injury); 0.5, Latent injury or widespread <lb/>bleeding; 1.0, Slight injury (2 to 3 dotted lines); 2.0, Severe injury (5-6 dotted injuries); 3.0, <lb/>Very severe injury (several continuous lined injuries) and 4.0, Widespread lined injury or <lb/>widened injury [33]. <lb/>Statistics <lb/>In anti-inflammatory study, data are expressed as value ± SEM. Results of carrageenan-<lb/>induced paw edema experiments are also expressed as percentage of change from <lb/>control (pre-drug) values. Differences between vehicle control and treatment groups were <lb/>tested using one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni&apos;s test. In <lb/>ulcerogenic study, Data are presented as mean ± SD and were subjected to one way <lb/>ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni&apos;s test. <lb/></body>
