			<body>With an average of one patient deceased every six <lb/>hospitalizations, in my 25 years as an intensive care doctor <lb/>I have been often forced to face death. Many times, I found <lb/>myself deciding whether and when it was appropriate <lb/>withholding or withdrawing life-support treatments when <lb/>they proved futile. As any Intensive Care physician or <lb/>nurse, I was trained in the use of extracorporeal prosthetic <lb/>techniques, which replace vital functions. In ICU we <lb/>continually use mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal <lb/>circulation systems, dialysis, and many, many drugs. Death <lb/>can be postponed to a limit that was unimaginable a few <lb/>decades ago. During my years as a resident in anaesthesia <lb/>and intensive care, I absorbed an alternative way of seeing <lb/>the functionality of the organs. Working shifts in intensive <lb/>care are very long; doctors in training and their mentors live <lb/>in strict contact, in a closed system that is constituted as a <lb/>whole world of experiences, full of objects that are not part <lb/>of everyday life. This &quot;unnatural&quot; condition, the availability <lb/>of advanced technologies that prolong life and the <lb/>contemporary and frequent contact with death, make it very <lb/>difficult an open and conscious discussion of end-of-life <lb/>decisions with other doctors and with relatives. I am sure <lb/>that the greatest difficulty I have encountered in my work <lb/>is the impossibility of speaking or communicating in any <lb/>way with my patients, to be able to cure them according to <lb/>their free choices on the therapy to be undertaken. <lb/>Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients who die in ICU <lb/>are not able to express their wishes in relation to invasive <lb/>care. In Italy, the so-called &quot;living will&quot; or &quot;early <lb/>declarations of treatment&quot; is not a widespread practice nor <lb/>is it an imperative for the doctor who treats a patient who is <lb/>not able to express his consent or his will. The ICU doctor, <lb/>young and inexperienced or full of experience and <lb/>responsibility, must try to &quot;guess&quot; the will of the person <lb/>who cares and, to apply those choices that she or he would <lb/>have shared if they were able to express their will, can only <lb/>address his/her family. In Italy, relatives do not exercise <lb/>any legal right to decide in place of the patient but are <lb/>considered witnesses of the patient&apos;s will. With Mr. <lb/>Antonio&apos;s daughter, this kind of approach did not work, to <lb/>the point that two Carabinieri showed up on Friday night to <lb/>check that all of us, doctors and nurses, were not abusing <lb/>our power over life or death. Mr. Antonio, immobilized in <lb/>his bed with a decidedly poor prognosis for more than a <lb/>year, had already been the object of discussion, sometimes <lb/>compassionate, sometimes cynical, among my colleagues. <lb/>It was necessary to make a complex decision, the definitive <lb/>one, on the suspension and non-implementation of <lb/>therapies, which were considered futile for Mr. Antonio. A <lb/>therapy is futile when it slows down rather than interrupting <lb/>the pathological process that leads to death. It is a treatment <lb/>that has no chance of therapeutic success. A futile therapy <lb/>should never be undertaken, but, as often happens, <lb/>orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation had been <lb/>imposed to Antonio, to all effects a terminally ill patient. <lb/>Perhaps, his prognosis had not been clearly defined in <lb/>emergency conditions and perhaps not all doctors would <lb/>have been able to define, so, &quot;right now&quot;, Antonio a <lb/>&quot;terminally ill&quot;, one arrived at the terminus of diseases for <lb/>which no effective treatment exists. Antonio is a terminal <lb/>patient not because he has a tumour but because, already <lb/>suffering from a chronic illness that prevented him from <lb/>speaking, eating, moving and recognizing his wife, he <lb/>developed a condition of multiorgan insufficiency for <lb/>which our care prolonged the agony without resolving the <lb/>cause of his disease for about a month, needlessly, futilely. <lb/>Once the prognostic judgment has been formulated, also in <lb/>relation to the results obtained in the first days of intensive <lb/>care, clinicians can communicate their impressions to the <lb/>family. An overall judgment should be drafted by a <lb/>multidisciplinary team, involving the nursing staff in the <lb/>decision and communication. In the case of Antonio and his <lb/>daughter, unfortunately, the decision to suspend the <lb/>intubation and ventilation, once these had proved decidedly <lb/>inappropriate, was communicated by a single doctor, my <lb/>most human and generous colleague, but also the youngest <lb/>doctor. Antonio&apos;s eldest daughter, with her load of <lb/>uncertainty, pain and guilt, did not find any other remedy <lb/>to her regret that call the police. The suspension of <lb/>mechanical ventilation is followed by the patient&apos;s death <lb/>within a few hours: the colleague on duty, Friday night, re-<lb/>intubated Antonio, admitting that the family had not been <lb/>sufficiently prepared and that had not shared the even clear <lb/>explanations already received. <lb/>-If my father bothers you, tell me where I have to move <lb/>him. <lb/>-Get out of here, you offend me. I replied angrily. <lb/></body>

			<body>I have thought so much in these days of Antonio and his <lb/>daughter, and of my mother and her peaceful death, without <lb/>excess, without strangers, but certainly not without pain. <lb/>&quot;Two beautiful things has the world: / Love and Death&quot;, <lb/>wrote Leopardi 1 for me and for Antonio and his daughter, <lb/>even though he never crossed the threshold of an ICU. <lb/>I apologized, she was sorry but did not change her mind. I <lb/>will be back in the ward on Monday. <lb/></body>
