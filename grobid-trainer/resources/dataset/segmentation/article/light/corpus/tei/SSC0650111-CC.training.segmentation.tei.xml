        <body>An antiferromagnetic phase transition, <lb/>indicated by a maximum in the magnetic <lb/>susceptibility <lb/>(K) and anomalies in the <lb/>electrical <lb/>resistivity <lb/>(p), has been widely <lb/>observed in sintered powders and single crystals <lb/>of LR2CuO 4. Work by Johnston et al. and <lb/>Freltoft et al. i on the variation of the Neel <lb/>temperature (TN) of La2Od04_ 6 as a function of 5 <lb/>in sintered powders and crystals indicates that <lb/>T N approaches zero as 6 goes to zero. <lb/>More <lb/>recent experiments 2 on single crystals of <lb/>La2Cu04_ ~ show the presence of strong 2D spin-<lb/>1/2 antiferromagnetic <lb/>fluctuations (quantum spin <lb/>fluid state) in the Cu-O planes above T N, with <lb/>three dimensional ordering setting in at <lb/>approximately 200 K in the crystal measured. <lb/>Although the nature of the proposed 2]) quantum <lb/>state is not understood theoretically, <lb/>its <lb/>existence is not surprising given the huge <lb/>anisotropy observed 3 in transport measurements <lb/>on single crystals of La2Cu04 that implies a <lb/>strongly 2D character in this material. <lb/>To <lb/>provide further understanding of the highly <lb/>unusual physical properties of La2Cu04, we have <lb/>investigated the magnetic, transport and thermal <lb/>properties of single crystals in magnetic fields <lb/>applied in different directions with respect to <lb/>the Cu-O plane. <lb/>Our samples were La2Cu04 crystals (~1 x 1 x <lb/>0.1 cm 3) grown from a PbO-based flux. <lb/>Lattice <lb/>constants were determined by the eight-position <lb/>Hamilton technique 4 using ten reflections with <lb/>29 ° &lt; e &lt; 37 ° . These x-ray measurements <lb/>indicated the orthorhombically distorted K2NiF4 <lb/>structure at room temperatuge with lattice <lb/>constants a = 5.358 ± O.O02A, b = 13.181 ± 0.007 <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>A and c = 5.403 ± 0.002 A (volume = 379.26 A3). <lb/>Wet chemical analyses gave a composition of <lb/>Lat.vsCu04.3, plus ~2 at % Pb, for the crystals <lb/>studied. <lb/>The presence of Pb and excess oxygen <lb/>may be associated in part with PbO flux at the <lb/>sample surface; however, this cannot account for <lb/>all the oxygen excess. <lb/>Resistance and magnetoresistance were <lb/>measured with a standard four probe technique <lb/>using In pressed contracts on the a-c basal <lb/>plane. <lb/>As plotted in Fig. 1, the resistance in <lb/>10 4 <lb/>, <lb/>~_ ~o~{ <lb/>Q: ~d <lb/>&lt; <lb/>n.-<lb/>&quot;% 10 ~ <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>,_1 <lb/>10 <lb/>La2CuO, <lb/>[ <lb/>T <lb/>1 <lb/>1 .oo <lb/>1 <lb/>~o.75 <lb/>L <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>IO00/TEMPERATURE <lb/>(K -~) <lb/>300 <lb/>Fig. 1. <lb/>Log e R vs. 1/T of a single crystal <lb/>La2CuO ~ sample in zero applied <lb/>magnetic field which does not show any <lb/>antiferromagnetic ordering-like <lb/>resistance anomaly.

        <body>The magnetization M, with magnetic field H <lb/>applied perpendicular to the basal plane, was <lb/>measured at various temperatures with a Quantum <lb/>Design SQUID susceptometer and is plotted in <lb/>Fig. 3. We see no evidence for a &quot;conventional&quot; <lb/>antiferromagnetic <lb/>transition, <lb/>i.e., a sharp cusp <lb/>in K(T), in these data. <lb/>Instead, we find a <lb/>rounded feature in the vicinity <lb/>of 120 K in a <lb/>measuring field of 0.3 T; this bump moves <lb/>10 <lb/>v <lb/>S <lb/>o <lb/>0 ~ <lb/>0 <lb/>m-<lb/>I -2.5 <lb/>&quot;1-O~ <lb/>n-<lb/>-2.5 <lb/>T <lb/>] <lb/>1 <lb/>La2CuO 4 <lb/>E*~-<lb/>~ <lb/>r <lb/>7 <lb/>4K <lb/>o_2 <lb/>;I <lb/>\ <lb/>r <lb/>70K <lb/>£% <lb/>• <lb/>o <lb/>5o <lb/>too <lb/>~5o <lb/>20o <lb/>• • • • • • • • <lb/>%• * <lb/>TEMPERATURE (K) <lb/>~-<lb/>107K <lb/>&quot; <lb/>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; <lb/>~ <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>MAGNETIC FIELD (T) <lb/>Fig. 2. <lb/>Representative magnetoresistance <lb/>curves of La2Cu04 at various fixed <lb/>temperatures. <lb/>The magnetic field is <lb/>applied perpendicular <lb/>to the Cu-O <lb/>plane. <lb/>The inset displays the phase <lb/>diagram determined from the mid-point <lb/>of the magnetoresistance jump. <lb/>magnetic field applied perpendicular <lb/>to the <lb/>basal plane. <lb/>The resistance drops rather <lb/>sharply at some magnetic field, suggesting the <lb/>presence of a field-induced phase transition. <lb/>(The notation &quot;phase transition&quot; <lb/>is used in the <lb/>sense of characterizing <lb/>the anomalies observed <lb/>as the temperature or magnetic field is varied.) <lb/>The resistance <lb/>drop is of the order of 10% at <lb/>4 K and the effect diminishes as the temperature <lb/>is raised, becoming undetectable in our <lb/>measurements above 120 K. This leads to some <lb/>uncertainty <lb/>in determining the high temperature <lb/>portion of the magnetic field-temperature <lb/>phase <lb/>diagram shown in the inset of Fig. 2. <lb/>Hysteresis, <lb/>seen clearly in the 4 K-curve in <lb/>Fig. 2, reduces rapidly as the temperature <lb/>increases and is unnoticeable above 20 K. We <lb/>note that conduction is highly anisotropic <lb/>in <lb/>these crystals. <lb/>The anisotropy factor was <lb/>determined by the Montgomery method s in several <lb/>specimens. <lb/>Although slight variations <lb/>from <lb/>sample to sample were found, typical values for <lb/>the anisotropy are &gt;150 (&gt;250) at room tempera-<lb/>ture (liquid nitrogen temperature), with the <lb/>lower resistivity <lb/>in the Cu-O plane. <lb/>Such a <lb/>huge anisotropy in the electrical <lb/>resistivity <lb/>clearly demonstrates that La2Cu04 is electroni-<lb/>cally two-dimensional. <lb/>Futhermore, the CU-O <lb/>plane has a metallic-like <lb/>temperature dependent <lb/>resistivity <lb/>above ~130 K but is semiconductor-<lb/>like at lower temperatures; however, <lb/>conductivity perpendicular <lb/>to the Cu-O plane is <lb/>semiconductor-like <lb/>for all T &lt; 300 K. <lb/>I&apos;. <lb/>• .... <lb/>.AO,ETO <lb/>O&apos;T&apos; <lb/>/ <lb/>N <lb/>o% <lb/>Oeeoo.ooo.ooOe ¶ <lb/>N <lb/>QOO000000001~ <lb/>Z <lb/>Oo .......... <lb/>. .... <lb/>| <lb/>&quot;: <lb/>I <lb/>L <lb/>..Jo.6 <lb/>1 <lb/>0.3 T <lb/>= <lb/>l <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>TEMPERATURE (K) <lb/>Fig. 3. <lb/>Magnetization vs. temperature measured <lb/>with applied field 0.3 T (refer to <lb/>right vertical <lb/>scale), 2.5 T, and 4 T <lb/>(refer to left vertical <lb/>scale). <lb/>The <lb/>temperature at which the rounded peak <lb/>occurs is approximately 120 K (80 K) <lb/>at 0.3 T (2.5 T). <lb/>A magnetization <lb/>curve at 20 K is plotted in the inset. <lb/>The total mass of measured crystals <lb/>was 343.37 mg and the applied field is <lb/>perpendicular <lb/>to the basal plane. <lb/>rapidly to lower temperatures as the field is <lb/>increased and disappears in the field of 4 T. <lb/>[Below ~170 K, the susceptibility <lb/>measured in a <lb/>4 T field can be fit to Kmole = ~o + C/(T + e), <lb/>where Ko = 8.2 x 10 -~ emu/mole Cu, C = 5.3 x <lb/>10 -° emu-K/mole Cu, and e = 37.5 K, implying an <lb/>effective moment of 0.21 y.D/Cu i£ the Curie term <lb/>is due solely to Cu.] The utemperatures at which <lb/>the peak appears in various fields agree with <lb/>the phase boundary shown in the inset of Fig. 2, <lb/>additionally <lb/>supporting the presence of a phase <lb/>transition. <lb/>The magnetization as a function of <lb/>applied magnetic field perpendicular to the <lb/>basal plane at 20 K is displayed in the inset of <lb/>Fig. 3, where a slope change can be seen clearly <lb/>near 3 T. <lb/>The jump in magnetization at 3 T and <lb/>20 K, defined by the construction shown in the <lb/>inset, is ~5,9 x 10 -4 emu, which implies an <lb/>increase of 1.25 x 10 -4 pB/formula unit. <lb/>We <lb/>note that the magnetization curve as a function <lb/>of magnetic field taken at 2 K shows a large <lb/>hysteresis <lb/>which by 20 K becomes smaller than <lb/>the experimental resolution. <lb/>It is interesting <lb/>that magnetization vs. magnetic field applied in <lb/>the basal plane at various fixed temperatures <lb/>does not show a similar jump within the <lb/>sensitivity <lb/>in our measurement. <lb/>We also note <lb/>that for 4 K &lt; T &lt; 350 K the magnetic <lb/>susceptibility <lb/>measured with H in the basal <lb/>plane is nearly three times smaller than that <lb/>with the magnetic field perpendicular <lb/>to the <lb/>basal plane. <lb/></body>

As shown in the <lb/>inset, an extrapolated value for the <lb/>linear term in the specific heat is 1 <lb/>mJ/mole K 2 and the Debye 8 D is 320 K. <lb/>extrapolation <lb/>of the data to T = 0 gives a <lb/>finite <lb/>intercept of 1.0 ± 0.1 mJ/mole Cu K2, 7,e <lb/>which is unchanged in a 10 T magnetic field, <lb/>suggesting that the finite value of C/T at T = 0 <lb/>may not be related to the phase transition. <lb/>Normalized per unit volume, the result ~ = 8.8 <lb/>J/m3K 2 is smaller than metallic copper by one <lb/>order o£ magnitude but several times larger than <lb/>typical structural <lb/>glasses, e.g. vitreous <lb/>silica. <lb/>The low temperature upturn in C/T may <lb/>si~l <lb/>the onset o£ a nuclear Schottky anomaly; <lb/>although, an alternative <lb/>explanation has been <lb/>proposed 9 that attributes <lb/>this behavior to the <lb/>presence of a hyperfine magnetic field at the Cu <lb/>nucleus produced by itinerant <lb/>antiferromagnetic <lb/>order in the Cu-O planes. <lb/>We emphasize that our experimental findings <lb/>are not limited to one crystal but are highly <lb/>reproducible: <lb/>the response of the magnetic <lb/>susceptibility <lb/>and resistance <lb/>to temperature and <lb/>magnetic field reported here has been observed <lb/>in several crystals <lb/>from the same preparation <lb/>batch. <lb/>I~gnetoresistance <lb/>measurements on <lb/>La2Cu04 crystals prepared in a different <lb/>batch, <lb/>but using the same growth procedure, also show a <lb/>phase transition <lb/>at similar fields and tempera-<lb/>tures. <lb/>Furthermore, the transition <lb/>was affected <lb/>only weakly by doping crystals with Zn impuri-<lb/>ties and by removing small amounts of oxygen via <lb/>vacuum annealing with a Zr getter. <lb/>In the <lb/>latter case, still <lb/>no evidence for 3D antiferro-<lb/>magnetic order was found but the magneto-<lb/>resistance anomaly at 4 K was less pronounced. <lb/>Analysis of resistivity <lb/>data on these other <lb/>crystals <lb/>results <lb/>in H-T phase diagrams similar <lb/>to the one in the inset of Fig. 2. <lb/>Likewise. <lb/></body>
