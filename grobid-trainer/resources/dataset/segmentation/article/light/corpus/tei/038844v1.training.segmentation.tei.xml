			<front>Abstract <lb/>40! <lb/>Field studies of wild vertebrates are frequently associated with extensive <lb/>41! <lb/>collections of banked fecal samples, which are often collected from known individuals <lb/>42! <lb/>and sometimes also sampled longitudinally across time. Such collections represent <lb/>43! <lb/>unique resources for understanding ecological, behavioral, and phylogenetic effects on <lb/>44! <lb/>the gut microbiome, especially for species of particular conservation concern. However, <lb/>45! <lb/>we do not understand whether sample storage methods confound the ability to investigate <lb/>46! <lb/>interindividual variation in gut microbiome profiles. This uncertainty arises in part <lb/>47! <lb/>because comparisons across storage methods to date generally include only a few (≤5) <lb/>48! <lb/>individuals, or analyze pooled samples. Here, we used n=52 samples from 13 rhesus <lb/>49! <lb/>macaque individuals to compare immediate freezing, the gold standard of preservation, to <lb/>50! <lb/>three methods commonly used in vertebrate field studies: storage in ethanol, <lb/>51! <lb/>lyophilization following ethanol storage, and storage in RNAlater. We found that the <lb/>52! <lb/>signature of individual identity consistently outweighed storage effects: alpha diversity <lb/>53! <lb/>and beta diversity measures were significantly correlated across methods, and while <lb/>54! <lb/>samples often clustered by donor, they never clustered by storage method. Provided that <lb/>55! <lb/>all analyzed samples are stored the same way, banked fecal samples therefore appear <lb/>56! <lb/>highly suitable for investigating variation in gut microbiota. Our results open the door to <lb/>57! <lb/>a much-expanded perspective on variation in the gut microbiome across species and <lb/>58! <lb/>ecological contexts. <lb/>59! <lb/>60! <lb/></front>

			<body>Although variation in gut microbiome profiles is extensively studied, we know <lb/>62! <lb/>little about how this variation is influenced by sample storage and handling. This is <lb/>63! <lb/>especially important for sample collections from field studies, which can be hugely <lb/>64! <lb/>informative resources for microbiome studies, but often utilize variable storage <lb/>65! <lb/>approaches. Here, we compare four fecal sample storage methods that are commonly <lb/>66! <lb/>used in field studies, including freezing, lyophilization, storage in ethanol, and RNAlater. <lb/>67! <lb/>We find that the effect of storage method on microbiome profiles is consistently smaller <lb/>68! <lb/>than the effect of individual identity. Our results indicate that sample storage method is <lb/>69! <lb/>unlikely to affect the results of a study, as long as the same storage method is used for all <lb/>70! <lb/>samples. By indicating the utility of using previously collected sample banks for gut <lb/>71! <lb/>microbiome profiling, our results open the door to a vastly expanded perspective on gut <lb/>72! <lb/>microbiome variation in the natural world. <lb/>73! <lb/>! <lb/>! <lb/>74! <lb/>! <lb/>75! <lb/>Main text <lb/>76! <lb/>Noninvasive collection is often the only feasible approach for obtaining samples <lb/>77! <lb/>from wild vertebrates, especially in threatened or endangered species [1]. Fecal samples <lb/>78! <lb/>are especially common, as they can be collected without disrupting study subjects, can <lb/>79! <lb/>often be unambiguously assigned to donors, and can be longitudinally collected from the <lb/>80! <lb/>same animal over time. Such samples also contain abundant information about the <lb/>81! <lb/>genetics, endocrinology, and parasite burden of the animals from which they are <lb/>82! <lb/>obtained. For these reasons, fecal samples may be the most extensively banked sample <lb/>83! <lb/>type available for wild vertebrates. <lb/>84! <lb/>! <lb/></body>

			<body>Such collections represent potentially invaluable resources for understanding <lb/>85! <lb/>interindividual variation in the gut microbiome in comparative or conservation contexts. <lb/>86! <lb/>However, sample storage methods vary widely across studies, and in most cases, samples <lb/>87! <lb/>were not collected with microbiome analyses in mind. To assess the potential for mining <lb/>88! <lb/>existing sample banks, we investigated how three common field storage methods affect <lb/>89! <lb/>gut microbiome diversity and composition estimates, compared to the gold standard of <lb/>90! <lb/>immediate freezing. We were particularly interested in comparing the roles of storage <lb/>91! <lb/>method versus individual identity. Although storage methods often explain substantial <lb/>92! <lb/>variation in microbiome composition when all other sources of variance are controlled <lb/>93! <lb/>(e.g., [2, 3], the degree to which they confound other analyses depends on their <lb/>94! <lb/>importance relative to the effects of biologically interesting variation (interindividual, <lb/>95! <lb/>temporal, and environmental). Previous studies have focused on small numbers of study <lb/>96! <lb/>subjects (n≤5), limiting their ability to evaluate this question [2-9]. <lb/>97! <lb/>Here, we compared fecal samples collected from 13 captive adult rhesus <lb/>98! <lb/>macaques (Macaca mulatta). Each fecal sample was divided into four aliquots (n=52 <lb/>99! <lb/>samples; Supplementary Information, Table S1), stored via: 1) immediate freezing at -20 <lb/>100! <lb/>°C; 2) immersion in absolute ethanol; 3) immersion in the preservative RNAlater; or 4) <lb/>101! <lb/>immersion in ethanol followed by lyophilization to powder (often used for steroid <lb/>102! <lb/>hormone analysis: [10]; drying protocols are also sometimes used for genetic samples: <lb/>103! <lb/>[11]). We extracted DNA from each sample, generated amplicon libraries targeting the <lb/>104! <lb/>bacterial 16s rRNA V4 region, and multiplexed these libraries for sequencing using a <lb/>105! <lb/>common 16s profiling method [12]. Following quality filtering, OTU abundances were <lb/>106! <lb/>estimated using open-reference OTU picking in QIIME [13]; Supplementary <lb/>107! <lb/>! <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>Information). We eliminated one ethanol sample because it generated very few reads; all <lb/>108! <lb/>remaining samples were rarefied to 54,633 reads for subsequent analyses. We identified <lb/>109! <lb/>21,006 OTUs overall (mean per sample=1,656 ±237 s.d.; Table S1). <lb/>110! <lb/>The resulting data recapitulated previous observations showing storage condition <lb/>111! <lb/>effects on mean alpha diversity (e.g., [2-4, 6]. In our case, samples stored in ethanol, then <lb/>112! <lb/>lyophilized, exhibited lower Shannon&apos;s Diversity Index (SDI) values relative to other <lb/>113! <lb/>conditions (Tukey&apos;s HSD: p between 7.6x10 -5 and 0.063), and samples stored in <lb/>114! <lb/>RNAlater exhibited somewhat higher values, although this comparison was only <lb/>115! <lb/>significant in comparison to the lyophilized condition (p=7.6x10 -5 ; Figure 1a; Table S2). <lb/>116! <lb/>However, in spite of these differences, SDI values retained a strong signature of <lb/>117! <lb/>individual identity. Specifically, SDI values were significantly correlated across samples <lb/>118! <lb/>from the same individual across storage methods (Figure 1b). Further, although we <lb/>119! <lb/>observed several rank changes across conditions (Figure 1a), individual identity <lb/>120! <lb/>explained a larger proportion of variance in SDI across samples than storage conditions <lb/>121! <lb/>(ANOVA: 50% versus 36%). We obtained qualitatively similar but weaker results for the <lb/>122! <lb/>number of OTUs identified in each sample (Figure S1), suggesting that the combination <lb/>123! <lb/>of species richness and evenness captured by SDI is more stable than richness alone. <lb/>124! <lb/>Beta diversity measures of community similarity (Tables S3-S5) were also more <lb/>125! <lb/>influenced by individual identity than sample storage condition. 66.3% of variation in <lb/>126! <lb/>taxonomic abundance could be explained by individual identity, compared to 14.3% by <lb/>127! <lb/>storage method (PERMANOVA on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix; p&lt;0.001 for both <lb/>128! <lb/>predictors). Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were much higher for pairs of samples collected <lb/>129! <lb/>from different individuals (mean=0.51 ±0.11 s.d. within condition; 0.56 ±0.11 s.d. <lb/>130! <lb/>! <lb/></listBibl>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>between conditions) than for samples collected from the same individual using different <lb/>131! <lb/>storage conditions (mean=0.35 ±0.11 s.d., Figure 2a; see also Figure S2). Samples from <lb/>132! <lb/>the same individual, but not storage condition, also clustered together in a hierarchical <lb/>133! <lb/>clustering analysis using either Bray-Curtis or unweighted UniFrac measures (Figure 2b; <lb/>134! <lb/>Figure S3a; no clustering, either by individual or storage condition, was observable using <lb/>135! <lb/>weighted UniFrac: Figure S3b). Most importantly, relative distances between individuals <lb/>136! <lb/>remained consistent across storage conditions. For example, pairwise correlations <lb/>137! <lb/>between Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices calculated separately for each condition were <lb/>138! <lb/>highly correlated (r=0.59 to 0.88, all p&lt;0.005; Table S6), with similar patterns observed <lb/>139! <lb/>using weighted or unweighted UniFrac (Tables S7-S8). <lb/>140! <lb/>Together, our results indicate that, while mean alpha and beta diversity values are <lb/>141! <lb/>sometimes altered by storage condition, biologically relevant signatures of individual <lb/>142! <lb/>identity tend to be retained, especially for measures of beta diversity. Our findings agree <lb/>143! <lb/>with previous studies using fewer individuals [5-7, 9], and extend them to three of the <lb/>144! <lb/>most commonly used storage methods in vertebrate field studies. For many types of <lb/>145! <lb/>studies, storage condition per se may therefore be less important than maintaining <lb/>146! <lb/>consistency in storage methods within a data set. Indeed, our estimates of the effects of <lb/>147! <lb/>individual identity are probably conservative given the standardized housing, diet, and <lb/>148! <lb/>social group structure of our study subjects. <lb/>149! <lb/>Our findings thus indicate the utility of using banked fecal sample collections <lb/>150! <lb/>from field studies for analyses of gut microbiome variation. These collections are not <lb/>151! <lb/>only substantial (ranging up to tens of thousands of samples), but are also often <lb/>152! <lb/>longitudinal, complemented by extensive demographic and behavioral metadata, and <lb/>153! <lb/>! <lb/></body>

Study subjects and sample collection <lb/>Study subjects were 13 adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), members of 7 <lb/>different social groups housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC). These <lb/>groups were formed as part of a separate study on the relationship between dominance rank and <lb/>gene regulation. All groups were maintained in standardized indoor-outdoor housing runs (25 m <lb/>x 25 m per run), under standardized demographic (5 adult females per group), dietary, and <lb/>observational conditions. <lb/>Fecal samples were collected opportunistically, within 10-15 minutes after deposition, <lb/>when females were briefly separated from the rest of their social groups for other purposes. Each <lb/>sample was subdivided into four equal subsamples, with the first subsample frozen immediately <lb/>at -20 °C; the second subsample immersed in the commercial preservative RNAlater (Life <lb/>Technologies, Carlsbad, CA); and the third and fourth subsamples immersed in absolute ethanol. <lb/>Samples were shipped overnight to Duke University either on dry ice (immediately frozen <lb/>samples) or at room temperature (RNAlater and ethanol samples). At Duke, one of the ethanol-<lb/>stored subsamples was processed following standard methods used to process fecal samples for <lb/>steroid hormone analysis in primate field studies [1]; see also <lb/>https://amboselibaboons.nd.edu/assets/75656/altmann_lab_protocols_jan08.pdf). In brief, the <lb/>ethanol storage medium was evaporated under a fume hood. The resulting dried sample was then <lb/>lyophilized at -50 °C under 0.1 millibar of vacuum pressure, and then sifted through a fine mesh <lb/>strainer to separate fecal matter from large, undigested fragments of vegetation. <lb/>DNA from all samples (n=52, representing 4 storage conditions for 13 individuals) was <lb/>extracted using MO BIO&apos;s PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, <lb/>CA). Extractions were conducted according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions, except that for <lb/>lyophilized samples, extractions were obtained from 0.05 g of sample instead of 0.25 g to avoid <lb/>complete absorption of liquid in the first steps of the DNA extraction, and subsequent extraction <lb/>failure. <lb/>B. 16s rRNA sequencing <lb/>Purified DNA samples were shipped to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center for <lb/>library preparation and sequencing. DNA isolated from fecal samples was quantified by 16S <lb/>rRNA sequencing. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified, using forward and <lb/>reverse primers 515F <lb/>(TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and <lb/>806R <lb/>(GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) <lb/>[2], followed by amplification with indexing primers (forward: <lb/>AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC[i5]TCGTCGGCAGCGTC, reverse: <lb/>CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT[i7]GTCTCGTGGGCTCGG, where [i5] and [i7] refer <lb/>to the index sequence codes used by Illumina). PCR amplification with the 515F/806R primer <lb/>pair was conducted using KAPA HiFidelity Hot Start Polymerase, under the following <lb/>conditions: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 cycles of denaturation <lb/>(20 s at 98 °C), annealing (15 s at 55 °C), and elongation (60 s at 72 °C). Amplified samples <lb/>were diluted 1:100 in water, and 5 µL of the 1:100 diluted sample were used for the second PCR <lb/>reaction with the indexing primers, using the same cycling conditions but for 10 cycles instead of <lb/>20. Pooled and size-selected samples were denatured in NaOH, diluted to 8 pM in Illumina&apos;s <lb/>HT1 buffer, spiked with 15% PhiX, and heat denatured at 96 °C for 2 minutes immediately prior <lb/>to loading on a MiSeq flowcell. We produced 300 bp paired-end sequences, with a mean of <lb/>238,734 (±131,840 s.d.) fragments sequenced for each sample (see Table S1 for sample-specific <lb/>information). <lb/>C. Low level data processing and OTU table construction <lb/>Following sample demultiplexing, primer sequences were removed from the raw reads <lb/>using CutAdapt v.1.7.1 [3]. Because CutAdapt does not always detect reverse primers effectively, <lb/>the first 29 base pairs (theoretically the primer and linker sequences) were removed from reverse <lb/>reads. Reads were truncated at the first base pair with a PHRED quality score ≤3, and forward <lb/>and reverse reads were then merged using USEARCH v6.1 [4]. Read pairs that failed to merge <lb/>were discarded. We used QIIME v1.8 to conduct further quality control filtering [5]. QIIME was <lb/>run with default parameters except for the minimum acceptable per-base Phred score parameter, <lb/>which we increased from 4 to 20. Putative chimeric sequences were identified using UCHIME <lb/>(implemented in USEARCH v6.1) [6], and sequences were discarded from the sample when both <lb/>reference-based (against the RDP Gold training database v9: [7] and de novo abundance-based <lb/>methods flagged them as likely chimeras. Chimeric sequences constituted 0.009% of our <lb/>sequencing reads. <lb/>To identify operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in our data set, we used the open-<lb/>reference OTU picking pipeline in QIIME. Specifically, the set of chimera-filtered reads was <lb/>first clustered using the UCLUST v1.2.22 algorithm and the GreenGenes database (May 2013 <lb/>release: [8], with a 97% identity threshold. Sequences that failed to cluster against the reference <lb/>database were then clustered de novo, with sequences that failed both clustering attempts <lb/>discarded. A representative sequence for each cluster was selected based on the most abundant <lb/>sequence, and then aligned using PyNAST v1.2.2 [9]. Sequences that failed to align were <lb/>discarded. Taxonomic identity was assigned to aligned OTUs using the RDP classifier v2.2 [10], <lb/>retrained to the May 2013 release of the GreenGenes database [8]. Singleton OTUs were <lb/>removed from the OTU table as they tend to be enriched for sequencing errors. At this stage, we <lb/>also removed one sample, the ethanol-stored sample for individual Ia13, due to low read count <lb/>(629 reads following quality control filtering). <lb/>For all subsequent analyses, we rarefied the OTU table to 54,633 reads per sample using <lb/>the QIIME v 1.8.0 script single_rarefaction.py. Subsampling reads from individuals with <lb/>uniformly high coverage across storage conditions supported the stability of our summary <lb/>statistics at this level of rarefaction (see Supplementary Methods, section E). <lb/>D. Alpha and beta diversity analyses <lb/>We calculated alpha diversity measures (Shannon&apos;s Diversity Index and number of <lb/>observed OTUs as a measure of species richness) using the QIIME v 1.8.0 script <lb/>alpha_diversity.py, and all beta diversity measures (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, unweighted <lb/>UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac) using the corresponding QIIME v 1.8.0 script beta_diversity.py <lb/>[5]. To estimate the minimum beta diversity dissimilarity due to random resampling error, we <lb/>used high sequencing depth samples for which at least five times the number of rarefied reads <lb/>were available (273,165 reads; n = 12). We drew five random subsamples from the total quality-<lb/>filtered read count for each of these samples. We then calculated all pairwise Bray-Curtis <lb/>dissimilarity values between subsamples from the same original sample. The median of these <lb/>dissimilarity values is shown as the dashed line in Figure 2a (and for weighted and unweighted <lb/>UniFrac analyses in Figure S2). <lb/> All statistical analyses on alpha and beta diversity values were conducted in R v 3.1.1 [11] <lb/>using either the R base packages or, for PERMANOVA, the R package vegan [12] and the R <lb/>package ade4 v 1.7-2 [13]. <lb/>E. Rarefaction analysis <lb/>After rarefaction, we retained a read depth of 54,633 reads per sample. To test whether <lb/>this read depth affected our ability to estimate correlations between SDI or Bray-Curtis <lb/>dissimilarities across storage conditions, we investigated the relationship between read depth, <lb/>SDI, and the dissimilarity values using the five individuals for whom we produced a large <lb/>number of reads across all four storage conditions (n=20 samples for Ve12, Tf12, Pp10, Js11, <lb/>and Jj10). For these individuals, we computed the SDI and Mantel test correlation between Bray-<lb/>Curtis dissimilarities at 10 different rarefaction levels: 98,039 reads, 54,633 reads (corresponding <lb/>to the sequencing depth used in the main analyses), 27,326 reads, 13,658 reads, 6,829 reads, <lb/>3,414 reads, 1,707 reads, 854 reads, 427 reads, and 213 reads. We performed a similar analysis <lb/>for the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic comparing Bray-Curtis dissimilarities from samples taken <lb/>from the same individual, stored in different conditions, to samples taken from different <lb/>individuals, from the same storage condition. In all cases, estimates stabilized at sequencing <lb/>depths lower than the one used in the main analysis (i.e., 54,633 reads), suggesting that our <lb/>analyses are not influenced by coverage concerns (Figure S4). <lb/></div>
