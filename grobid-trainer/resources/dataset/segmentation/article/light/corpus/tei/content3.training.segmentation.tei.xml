			<front>Summary <lb/>Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway essential for neuronal health <lb/>and function. Autophagosome biogenesis occurs at synapses, is locally regulated <lb/>and increases in response to neuronal activity. The mechanisms that couple <lb/>autophagosome biogenesis to synaptic activity remain unknown. In this study we <lb/>determine that trafficking of ATG-9, the only transmembrane protein in the core <lb/>autophagy pathway, links the synaptic vesicle cycle with autophagy. ATG-9 <lb/>positive vesicles in C. elegans are generated from the trans-Golgi network via AP3-<lb/>dependent budding, and delivered to presynaptic sites. At presynaptic sites, ATG-<lb/>9 undergoes exo-endocytosis in an activity-dependent manner. Mutations that <lb/>disrupt endocytosis, including one associated with Parkinson&apos;s disease, result in <lb/>abnormal ATG-9 accumulation at clathrin-rich synaptic foci and defects in activity-<lb/>dependent presynaptic autophagy. Our findings uncover regulated key steps of <lb/>ATG-9 trafficking at presynaptic sites, and provide evidence that ATG-9 exo-<lb/>endocytosis couples autophagosome biogenesis at presynaptic sites with the <lb/>activity-dependent synaptic vesicle cycle. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Macroautophagy (herein called autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved <lb/>cellular degradative process that is essential for neuronal physiology and survival <lb/>(Son et al., 2012, Stavoe and Holzbaur, 2019, Azarnia Tehran et al., 2018, Kulkarni <lb/>et al., 2018, Liang and Sigrist, 2018, Menzies et al., 2017, Vijayan and Verstreken, <lb/>2017, Menzies et al., 2015, Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993, Yorimitsu and Klionsky, <lb/>2005). Neurons are particularly vulnerable to dysfunctional organelles and <lb/>damaged proteins due to their post-mitotic nature, their polarized morphology and <lb/>their high metabolic activity states during neuronal stimulation. Autophagy is <lb/>regulated to cater to these neurophysiological needs. For example, local <lb/>autophagosome biogenesis occurs near synapses and autophagosome <lb/>biogenesis is coupled to the neuronal activity state (Bunge, 1973, Soukup et al., <lb/>2016, Maday et al., 2012, Stavoe et al., 2016, Katsumata et al., 2010, Shehata et <lb/>al., 2012, Hill et al., 2019). Disruption of synaptic autophagy has been associated <lb/>with the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, synaptic dysfunction <lb/>and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&apos;s disease (Hoffmann et al., <lb/>2019, Hill et al., 2019, Lynch-Day et al., 2012, Zavodszky et al., 2014, Karabiyik et <lb/>al., 2017, Cheung and Ip, 2009). <lb/>Molecules that regulate synaptic transmission and function, including <lb/>proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis, were reported to regulate <lb/>autophagy at presynaptic sites (Soukup et al., 2016, George et al., 2016, <lb/>Vanhauwaert et al., 2017, Murdoch et al., 2016, Kononenko et al., 2017, Binotti et <lb/>al., 2015). For example, in Drosophila, endophilin A, a protein mainly known for its <lb/></body>

			<body>role in endocytosis, was proposed to directly regulate autophagosome formation <lb/>by inducing curved membranes that can recruit autophagic machinery (Soukup et <lb/>al., 2016, Milosevic et al., 2011). Synaptojanin 1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase <lb/>implicated in the endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles (Cremona et al., 1999, <lb/>Verstreken et al., 2003, Harris et al., 2000), was also reported to play roles in the <lb/>control of synaptic autophagy in zebrafish and Drosophila (Vanhauwaert et al., <lb/>2017, George et al., 2016). Recent studies have revealed links between these <lb/>canonical endocytic proteins and early-onset parkinsonism (EOP), suggesting a <lb/>relationship between the synaptic vesicle cycle (which is tied to synaptic activity), <lb/>autophagy and neurodegenerative diseases (Vidyadhara et al., 2019, Trinh and <lb/>Farrer, 2013, Alegre-Abarrategui and Wade-Martins, 2009, Bandres-Ciga et al., <lb/>2019, Schreij et al., 2016, Quadri et al., 2013, Krebs et al., 2013). Yet, the <lb/>mechanistic links underlying the coupling between synaptic activity and <lb/>autophagosome formation remain unknown. <lb/>In this study we examined the dynamics of ATG-9, the only transmembrane <lb/>protein of the core autophagy machinery, at synapses of C. elegans and <lb/>mammalian neurons. ATG-9 is thought to promote local autophagosome <lb/>biogenesis through its role as a lipid scramblase that cooperates with the lipid <lb/>transport protein ATG2 in the nucleation of the isolation membrane in nascent <lb/>autophagosomes (Karanasios et al., 2016, Reggiori et al., 2005, Reggiori et al., <lb/>2004, Sawa-Makarska et al., 2020, Guardia et al., 2020, Matoba et al., 2020, <lb/>Matoba and Noda, 2020, Maeda et al., 2020, Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2018). We <lb/>find that at synapses, ATG-9 links the synaptic vesicle cycle to autophagy. <lb/></body>

			<body>Specifically, we observe that in C. elegans neurons, ATG-9 is delivered to <lb/>presynaptic sites in vesicles generated by the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via AP-<lb/>3-dependent budding. At presynaptic sites, ATG-9 positive vesicles undergo exo-<lb/>endocytosis in a synaptic activity-dependent manner. Mutants that disrupt synaptic <lb/>endocytic traffic, including a synaptojanin 1/unc-26 allele that mimics a Parkinson <lb/>disease mutation, result in abnormal accumulation of ATG-9 in clathrin-rich foci, <lb/>and defects in activity-dependent synaptic autophagy. Mutations that affect <lb/>autophagosome biogenesis also result in abnormal accumulations of ATG-9 in <lb/>clathrin-rich foci, further suggesting a relation between endocytic trafficking of <lb/>ATG-9 and nucleation of autophagosomes at presynaptic sites. In mammalian <lb/>hippocampal neurons, mutations in endocytic proteins similarly result in abnormal <lb/>ATG9 accumulation in nerve terminals, indicating conserved mechanisms of ATG-<lb/>9 trafficking at synapses. Collectively our studies identify the regulated dynamics <lb/>of ATG-9 trafficking at presynaptic sites and provide insight into mechanisms that <lb/>couple the synaptic vesicle cycle (related to synaptic activity) to presynaptic <lb/>autophagy. <lb/>Results <lb/>In C. elegans ATG-9 is transported to synapses in vesicles generated in the <lb/>trans-Golgi network (TGN) via AP-3-dependent budding. <lb/>Autophagy occurs at presynaptic sites in response to synaptic activity, and <lb/>transmembrane protein ATG-9 plays a critical role in local synaptic autophagy <lb/></body>

			<body>(Stavoe et al., 2016, Hill et al., 2019, Soukup et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2015, <lb/>Shehata et al., 2012). To understand the dynamics of ATG-9 at presynaptic sites, <lb/>we first examined the in vivo localization of ATG-9 in the AIY interneurons of C. <lb/>elegans. AIYs are a pair of bilaterally symmetric interneurons which display a <lb/>stereotypical distribution of presynaptic specializations along their neurites ((White <lb/>et al., 1986, Colon-Ramos et al., 2007); (Figures 1A-1B)). Simultaneous <lb/>visualization of the presynaptic marker mCherry::RAB-3 and ATG-9::GFP revealed <lb/>that ATG-9 localization in neurons is discrete, compartmentalized and enriched at <lb/>subcellular structures in the cell body and at presynaptic regions ((Stavoe et al., <lb/>2016); (Figures 1C-1F, 1C&apos;)). <lb/>To identify ATG-9 positive structures at synapses, we performed post-<lb/>embedding immunogold electron microscopy of transgenic animals expressing <lb/>ATG-9::GFP, by using antibodies directed against GFP. We observed that the <lb/>majority of the immunogold particles (75%) localized to the presynaptic areas <lb/>occupied by synaptic vesicles, with occasional localization of gold particles on the <lb/>plasma membrane (&lt;10%) (Figures 1G, S1A-S1D). However, the distribution of <lb/>immunogold particles was generally non-homogeneous in the synaptic vesicle-<lb/>positive areas. Accordingly, comparison by light microscopy with the localization <lb/>of mCherry::RAB-3 and of a well-established synaptic vesicle integral membrane <lb/>protein, SNG-1::BFP, revealed strong colocalization between mCherry::RAB-3 <lb/>and SNG-1::BFP, but subtle differences between the colocalization of these two <lb/>proteins and ATG-9::GFP (Figures 1H-1K), consistent with ATG-9 being enriched <lb/>on a subpopulation of vesicles. <lb/></body>

			<body>To determine the site of ATG-9 localization within the cell soma, we co-<lb/>expressed either ATG-9::mCherry or ATG-9::GFP with other organelle markers <lb/>(Reggiori et al., 2005, Karanasios et al., 2016, van der Vaart and Reggiori, 2010, <lb/>Puri et al., 2013). We observed that ATG-9::GFP was concentrated at sites that <lb/>overlapped with trans-Golgi marker TGN-38::mCherry and that ATG-9::mCherry <lb/>was directly adjacent to the medial/cis-Golgi marker AMAN-2::GFP, but did not <lb/>overlap with other organelles markers (Figures 1L-1R, 1L&apos;, S1E-S1K). These <lb/>findings, which are consistent with observations from yeast and mammalian culture <lb/>cells (Noda, 2017, Webber et al., 2007, Ohashi and Munro, 2010), indicate a trans-<lb/>Golgi-specific enrichment of ATG-9 in the neuronal cell body. <lb/>The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is where vesicles destined for transport to <lb/>distinct subcellular locations are packaged. Coat protein complexes such as <lb/>members of the heterotetrameric family of adaptor proteins (APs) regulate this <lb/>process by sorting cargoes into distinct vesicular carriers (Park and Guo, 2014, <lb/>Nakatsu and Ohno, 2003, Mattera et al., 2017, Badolato and Parolini, 2007, <lb/>Dell&apos;Angelica et al., 1997). In vertebrate, AP-4 is particularly important in exporting <lb/>transmembrane protein ATG9A from the Golgi apparatus, leading to neurological <lb/>disorders (Yamamoto et al., 2012, De Pace et al., 2018, Mattera et al., 2017). In <lb/>C. elegans and other invertebrates, however, no orthologues of AP-4 have been <lb/>characterized. Which proteins are then required for the biogenesis of ATG-9 <lb/>positive vesicles? <lb/>We tested mutants for AP complexes UNC-101/AP-1, DPY-23/AP-2 and <lb/>AP-3 (Park and Guo, 2014, Nakatsu and Ohno, 2003) and did not observe <lb/></body>

			<body>abnormal localization of ATG-9 in loss-of-function alleles of unc-101(m1)/ap-1 or <lb/>dpy-23(e840)/ap-2 (data not shown). However, a putative null allele for apb-<lb/>3(ok429), a gene encoding a subunit of the AP-3 complex, displayed a reduction <lb/>of ATG-9 at synapses (Figures 1S-1U, 1X). The AP-3 complex comprises four <lb/>subunits -apb-3/β3-adaptin, apd-3/δ-adaptin, apm-3/μ3 and aps-3/σ3. Putative <lb/>null alleles for the three AP-3 complex subunits (apb-3/β3-adaptin, apm-3/μ3, apd-<lb/>3/δ-adaptin) resulted in enrichment of ATG-9 at the cell body (Figure 1Y). <lb/>Interestingly, these alleles did not affect the localization of the synaptic vesicle <lb/>proteins SNG-1 or RAB-3 to presynaptic sites, suggesting that the observed <lb/>decrease of ATG-9 at synapses is not due to a general problem in synaptic vesicle <lb/>biogenesis (Figures 1V-1W, 1Z, S1L-S1O). Together, our findings reveal that in <lb/>vivo in C. elegans neurons, enrichment of ATG-9 at presynaptic sites results from <lb/>AP-3 mediated export of ATG-9 positive vesicles at the TGN. <lb/>ATG-9 undergoes exo-endocytosis at presynaptic sites. <lb/>The concentration of ATG-9 on vesicles at presynaptic sites and its <lb/>occasional localization in the axonal plasma membrane raised the possibility that <lb/>this protein may be a component of vesicles that undergo exo-endocytosis. To <lb/>address this possibility, we imaged ATG-9 synaptic localization in C. elegans <lb/>neurons in mutants with disrupted exo-endocytic traffic at presynaptic sites (Harris <lb/>et al., 2000, Watanabe et al., 2014, Sudhof, 1995, Saheki and De Camilli, 2012) <lb/>(Figure 2A). We observed that endocytic mutants unc-26(e205)/synaptojanin 1, <lb/>unc-57(ok310)/endophilin A, unc-11(e47)/AP180 and temperature-sensitive dyn-<lb/></body>

			<body>1(ky51) displayed defects in ATG-9 localization at synapses (Figures 2B-2H). For <lb/>example, in the AIY interneuron presynaptic-rich region (termed Zone 2; (Colon-<lb/>Ramos et al., 2007)), the ATG-9::GFP signal is predominantly concentrated in a <lb/>homogenous manner across this presynaptic area (Figures 1E, 1K, 2B-2B&apos;, 2C). <lb/>However, in all the endocytic mutants examined, most animals display abnormal <lb/>accumulation of ATG-9::GFP into multiple subsynaptic foci (Figures 2D-2H, 2SA-<lb/>B). To quantify the genetic expressivity of the phenotype, we defined an index for <lb/>ATG-9 mislocalization (briefly, the index was defined as the number of local signal <lb/>peaks divided by their width, see STAR Methods). We found that in the endocytic <lb/>mutants there was a significant difference in the subsynaptic localization of ATG-<lb/>9, with ATG-9 abnormally enriched at discrete foci within the presynaptic regions <lb/>(Figure 2K). <lb/>Are endocytic proteins acting cell autonomously in neurons to regulate <lb/>ATG-9 subsynaptic localization? To address this question, we focused on UNC-<lb/>26/synaptojanin-1. Expressing unc-26 cDNA cell specifically in the AIY <lb/>interneurons of unc-26(e205) mutants rescued ATG-9 defects at the synapse, <lb/>indicating that UNC-26 acts cell autonomously in neurons to prevent abnormal <lb/>ATG-9 accumulation at subsynaptic foci (Figures S2C-S2E). <lb/>If the accumulation of ATG-9 at abnormal foci in endocytic mutants is due <lb/>to abnormal endocytic traffic, then mutants in exocytosis should suppress this <lb/>phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we examined putative null alleles unc-<lb/>13(s69)/Munc13 and unc-18(e81)/Munc18, which encode essential components <lb/>of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Hata et al., 1993, Richmond et al., 1999).

			<body>mutants of unc-13(s69) and unc-18(e81) did not disrupt ATG-9 localization <lb/>(Figures S2A, S2F-S2G). Importantly, double mutants of unc-13(s69);unc-<lb/>26(e205) and unc-18(e81);unc-26(s1710) suppressed the unc-26/synaptojanin 1 <lb/>phenotype, indicating that the accumulation of ATG-9 at abnormal foci depends on <lb/>synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Figures 2I-2K, S2A). <lb/>Our genetic perturbations in C. elegans are consistent with ATG-9 positive <lb/>vesicles undergoing exo-endocytosis at presynaptic sites. To better examine this, <lb/>we imaged ATG-9 dynamics in a loss-of-function allele of phosphofructokinase <lb/>1/pfk-1.1(gk922689). The absence of phosphofructokinase, like the absence of <lb/>other glycolytic proteins, results in impaired synaptic vesicle endocytosis during <lb/>transient hypoxia (Jang et al., 2016). Through the use of a microfluidic device that <lb/>allows precise control of transient cycles of normoxia and hypoxia, we can <lb/>temporally control the endocytic reaction (Jang et al., 2020). We examined ATG-9 <lb/>localization in the synaptic Zone 3 region (Figure L-L&apos;), in which we can observe <lb/>discrete and interspersed presynaptic specializations (compare to the Zone 2 <lb/>region (Figure 2B-B&apos;), which consists of one large and continuous presynaptic <lb/>area). Visualization of ATG-9 in the Zone 3 region enabled us to determine local <lb/>ATG-9 dynamics due to transient inhibition of endocytosis. We observed that in <lb/>pfk-1.1(gk922689) mutants, transient inhibition of endocytosis during transient <lb/>hypoxia correlated with changes in ATG-9 localization: namely, ATG-9 relocalized <lb/>from discrete presynaptic clusters in the synaptic Zone 3 region, to a more diffuse <lb/>distribution, consistent with what would be expected if ATG-9 were trapped at the <lb/>plasma membrane due to short-term defects in endocytosis. Conversely, removing <lb/></body>

			<body>the endocytic block by shifting to normoxia rescued the localization of ATG-9 to <lb/>the presynaptic clusters (Figures 2L-2M). Together, our data indicate that ATG-9 <lb/>positive vesicles undergo exo-endocytosis at presynaptic sites by using the <lb/>synaptic vesicle cycling machinery. <lb/>ATG-9 mislocalization phenotypes are enhanced under conditions that <lb/>increase AIY activity-state. <lb/>We next examined if the mislocalization phenotype of ATG-9 could be <lb/>modified based on physiologically relevant stimuli known to increase the activity <lb/>state of the neuron, and known to increase synaptic autophagy (Hill et al., 2019). <lb/>AIY neurons in C. elegans are part of the thermotaxis circuit, which allows animals <lb/>to navigate towards their cultivation temperature, and the activity state of AIY <lb/>increases based on the cultivation temperature at which the organism is reared <lb/>(Clark et al., 2006, Hawk et al., 2018). At higher cultivation temperatures, AIY <lb/>displays increases in activity-dependent synaptic autophagy (Hill et al., 2019). <lb/>We observed that the penetrance of the ATG-9 phenotype in unc-<lb/>26(s1710)/synaptojanin 1 mutants similarly varied depending on the cultivation <lb/>temperature of the animals. At higher cultivation temperatures, known to increase <lb/>the activity state of AIY and synaptic autophagy, we observed a higher percentage <lb/>of unc-26(s1710)/synaptojanin 1 mutant animals displaying abnormal ATG-9 foci <lb/>at synapses (Figure 2N). Moreover, temperature-dependent increases of <lb/>abnormal ATG-9 foci in unc-26(s1710)/synaptojanin 1 mutant animals were <lb/>suppressed by the exocytosis mutant unc-13(s69) (Figure 2N). <lb/></body>

			<body>Biochemical evidence that ATG9 travels to and from the plasma membrane. <lb/>Our results are consistent with published evidence that ATG-9 can be <lb/>exposed at the cell surface and then re-internalized by endocytosis in mammalian <lb/>fibroblastic cells, as revealed by immunocytochemistry following perturbation of a <lb/>critical endocytic factor, dynamin, either pharmacologically or by dominant <lb/>interference (Puri et al., 2013, Feng and Klionsky, 2017, Zhou et al., 2017). To <lb/>obtain direct biochemical evidence for ATG9 exo-endocytosis, we performed cell <lb/>surface biotinylation experiments (with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin) in tamoxifen-<lb/>inducible dynamin 1 and 2 double knock-out (DKO) mouse fibroblasts (Ferguson <lb/>et al., 2009). A pool of ATG9A, and of transferrin receptor as a control, was <lb/>detected at the plasma membrane in control fibroblasts, and these pools were <lb/>enhanced (Figures 3A-3C) in fibroblasts where the expression of dynamin 1 and 2 <lb/>had been suppressed by tamoxifen (Figures S3A-S3B), providing biochemical <lb/>evidence that ATG-9 travels to and from the plasma membrane, and that its <lb/>internalization depends on endocytic proteins. <lb/>In unc-26/synaptojanin 1 mutants, ATG-9 accumulates at presynaptic, <lb/>clathrin-rich sites. <lb/>What are the subsynaptic foci where ATG-9 is enriched in endocytic <lb/>mutants?

Consistent with these <lb/>findings, RAB-3::mCherry and SNG-1::GFP displayed diffuse localization in unc-<lb/>26(s1710)/synaptojanin 1 mutants (Figures S3C-S3F). These phenotypes are <lb/>distinct from the ones observed for ATG-9, as SNG-1::BFP in unc-26(s1710) <lb/>mutants failed to localize similarly to ATG-9::GFP at subsynaptic foci (Figures 3D-<lb/>3F, 3M). Our data indicate that while ATG-9 undergoes exo-endocytosis at the <lb/>synapse in an activity dependent manner, mutations in endocytic proteins affect <lb/>ATG-9 and a bona fide synaptic vesicle protein differently. <lb/>We next examined if ATG-9 was abnormally localized to immature <lb/>autophagosomes.

We found <lb/>that in the unc-26(s1710) mutants, CHC-1 localized to abnormal foci at synapses <lb/>(Figures 3K, S3G) and it colocalized well with ATG-9 (Figures 3J-3M). Based on <lb/>previous findings (Harris et al., 2000, Cremona et al., 1999, Verstreken et al., <lb/>2003), these clathrin-rich foci at the synapses probably represent abnormal <lb/>endocytic intermediates (Figures 3J-3M). <lb/>To sum up, ATG-9 accumulates at presynaptic clathrin-rich structures in <lb/>unc-26/synaptojanin 1 mutants. <lb/>In autophagy mutants, ATG-9 accumulates into endocytic intermediates at <lb/>presynaptic sites. <lb/>The critical role of ATG-9 in autophagy predicts that disruption of autophagy <lb/>should impact ATG-9 localization (Reggiori et al., 2004, Sekito et al., 2009, Lu et <lb/>al., 2011). Thus, we also examined ATG-9 localization in mutants with disrupted <lb/>autophagy (Figure 4A). In loss-of-function alleles unc-51(e369)/ATG1, epg-<lb/>9(bp320)/Atg101, atg-13(bp414)/epg-1 and epg-8(bp251)/Atg14 (Crawley et al., <lb/>2019, Liang et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2013) that affect early steps of <lb/>autophagosome initiation, we observed abnormal focal accumulation of ATG-9 at <lb/>presynaptic sites (Figures 4B-4G). Similar to unc-26 mutants, the abnormal focal <lb/>accumulation of ATG-9::GFP in epg-9(bp414) autophagy mutants co-localized <lb/>with clathrin heavy chain BFP::CHC-1 (Figures 4I-4K). <lb/>Is the abnormal localization of ATG-9 in early autophagy mutants affected <lb/>under conditions of increased synaptic activity state and autophagy?

			<body>ATG-9 in epg-9(bp414) mutants reared at 15°C, 20°C and 25°C, and found that <lb/>the penetrance of the ATG-9 phenotype in the AIY interneurons of epg-9(bp414) <lb/>mutants varied according to the cultivation temperature of the animals (which <lb/>relates to the activity state of the AIY interneuron (Clark et al., 2006, Hawk et al., <lb/>2018); (Figure 4H)). The effects of temperature on the abnormal localization of <lb/>ATG-9 to foci in autophagy mutants are similar to those observed for ATG-9 in <lb/>endocytic mutants (Figure 4H and Figure 2N). <lb/>To then relate changes in ATG-9 localization at the synapse with activity-<lb/>dependent increases in synaptic autophagy, we examined LGG-1/Atg8/GABARAP <lb/>puncta in mutant backgrounds that affect exo-endocytosis at the synapse. <lb/>Consistent with the previous findings (Hill et al., 2019, Hawk et al., 2018), we <lb/>observed the average number of LGG-1 puncta increased when the wild type <lb/>animals were cultivated at 25°C, a condition known to increase the activity state of <lb/>the AIY neurons (Hawk et al., 2018) and synaptic autophagy (Hill et al., 2019) <lb/>(Figure 4L, S4A-S4C). Inhibiting exocytosis (in unc-13(s69) mutants) or disrupting <lb/>the autophagy pathway (in atg-9(wy56) mutants) eliminated the capacity of the <lb/>neuron to increase synaptic autophagy in response to increases in the cultivation <lb/>temperature (Figure 4L, S4C). We observed higher numbers of LGG-1 puncta <lb/>under basal conditions in unc-26(s1710) mutants (Figures S4C). The LGG-1 <lb/>puncta in unc-26(s1710) mutants could not be suppressed by autophagy mutants, <lb/>suggesting the increased LGG-1 puncta were not bona-fide functional <lb/>autophagosomes (Figures S4C).

Our findings are consistent with <lb/>previous studies that provide evidence that synaptojanin 1 is important for <lb/>autophagosome formation when inducing autophagy (Vanhauwaert et al., 2017). <lb/>We extend these studies, now demonstrating a link between exo-endocytic traffic <lb/>of ATG-9 at presynaptic sites, and activity-dependent presynaptic autophagy. <lb/>Abnormal accumulation of ATG9A in nerve terminals of mammalian neurons <lb/>with mutations in endocytic proteins. <lb/>We next investigated whether the effect of perturbation of endocytosis on ATG9A <lb/>dynamics in nerve terminals is conserved at mammalian synapses. To this end, <lb/>we explored the localization of ATG9A in nerve terminals of hippocampal neuronal <lb/>cultures of mice double KO for dynamin 1 and 3 (the two neuronally enriched <lb/>dynamin isoforms) and KO for synaptojanin 1 (SJ1) (the neuronally enriched <lb/>synaptojanin isoform) (Raimondi et al., 2011, Cremona et al., 1999, Ferguson and <lb/>De Camilli, 2012). Synapses of both genotypes are characterized by a massive <lb/>accumulation of synaptic vesicle endocytic intermediates, endocytic pits in the <lb/>case of dynamin mutants and clathrin coated vesicles in the case of synaptojanin <lb/>1 mutants. This accumulation is reflected in a very robust clustering in presynaptic <lb/>terminals of immunoreactive signal for endocytic factors, including clathrin, clathrin <lb/>adaptors and their accessory proteins such as amphiphysin 2 (Raimondi et al., <lb/>2011, Hayashi et al., 2008, Ferguson et al., 2007, Milosevic et al., 2011). <lb/>Accordingly, anti-amphiphysin 2 immunofluorescence revealed a much stronger <lb/>synaptic staining in dynamin 1 and 3 DKO neurons, and in SJ1 KO neurons, than <lb/></body>

			<body>in controls (Figures 5). Importantly, anti-ATG9A immunofluorescence also <lb/>revealed a striking accumulation of this protein at a subset of mutant synapses <lb/>relative to WT synapses (Figures 5A-5B, 5E-5F). Such hot spots of ATG9A <lb/>colocalized with amphiphysin 2 immunoreactivity, confirming the synaptic <lb/>localization of anti-ATG9A (Figure 5). However, the number of synaptic puncta <lb/>were more numerous for amphiphysin 2 than for ATG9A, suggesting a <lb/>heterogeneous localization of ATG9A at synapses, or a different impact of the <lb/>perturbation of dynamin and SJ1 on ATG9A in different neurons. <lb/>A mutation in unc-26/synaptojanin 1 associated with early-onset <lb/>Parkinsonism (EOP) leads to abnormal focal accumulation of ATG-9 in <lb/>presynaptic nerve terminals. <lb/>ATG-9 links autophagy, endocytosis and neuronal activity at synapses. <lb/>Abnormal function of these processes, which are crucial for maintaining neuronal <lb/>health and homeostasis, have been implicated in Parkinson&apos;s disease (Vidyadhara <lb/>et al., 2019, Anglade et al., 1997, Lynch-Day et al., 2012). A missense mutation at <lb/>an evolutionarily conserved position in the PI4P phosphatase domain of Sac1 <lb/>domain of SJ1 (R258Q) is associated with early-onset Parkinsonism (Quadri et al., <lb/>2013, Krebs et al., 2013). Introduction of the same mutation in mouse and <lb/>Drosophila was reported to affect endocytic trafficking and autophagosome <lb/>maturation at synapses (Cao et al., 2017, Vanhauwaert et al., 2017). The mutant <lb/>position, which impairs the catalytic activity of the Sac1 domain, is conserved in C. <lb/>elegans (R216Q) (Figure 6A). Does this mutation also affect ATG9A localization <lb/></body>

			<body>at synapses? We addressed this question both in neuronal cultures of previously <lb/>described homozygous knock-in mice with the PD mutation (SJ1 RQ KI mice) (Cao <lb/>et al., 2017) and in C. elegans in which we engineered the homozygous <lb/>Parkinson&apos;s disease mutation (R216Q) via CRISPR-Cas9. <lb/>Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous ATG9A in hippocampal <lb/>cultures generated from SJ1 RQ KI mice revealed abnormal ATG9A accumulations <lb/>that colocalized with focal enrichment of amphiphysin 2 foci at synapses (Figures <lb/>6B-6E, 6I) and were similar to those observed in SJ1 KO neurons (Figures 5E-5H). <lb/>As in the case of dynamin 1 and 3 DKO synapses and of SJ1 KO synapses <lb/>(Hayashi et al., 2008, Raimondi et al., 2011), such accumulations were typically <lb/>more prominent in inhibitory presynaptic GABA-ergic nerve terminals -as revealed <lb/>by immunostaining for vGAT (Figures 6F-6H, 6F&apos;-6H&apos;), which generally have higher <lb/>levels of tonic activity. <lb/>Likewise, in unc-26 (R216Q) mutant C. elegans, ATG-9::GFP was <lb/>abnormally localized to subsynaptic foci which resembled those observed in unc-<lb/>26(e205)/SJ1 null alleles -and accordingly were enriched in clathrin -albeit with a <lb/>lower penetrance, consistent with partial loss of function (Figures 6J-6M, S5H-<lb/>S5J). <lb/>We also observed that the unc-26(R216Q) allele, contrary to the loss-of-<lb/>function allele, did not produce obvious changes in the localization of the synaptic <lb/>vesicle proteins SNG-1 or RAB-3 at presynaptic regions (Figures S5A-S5G), <lb/>showing that unc-26 (R216Q) differentially affects ATG-9 localization and synaptic <lb/>vesicle protein localization. These findings are consistent with Drosophila studies <lb/></body>

We examined two putative <lb/>null alleles of SAC-2 in C. elegans, sac-2(gk927434) and sac-2(gk346019), for <lb/>phenotypes in ATG-9 localization. While single mutants of sac-2 do not affect ATG-<lb/>9 localization (data not shown), sac-2(gk927434);unc-26(s1710) and sac-<lb/>2(gk346019);unc-26(s1710) double mutants enhance the abnormal localization of <lb/>ATG-9 in unc-26(s1710) single null allele, suggesting that sac-2 and unc-<lb/>26/synaptojanin 1 function synergistically in mediating ATG-9 trafficking at <lb/>synapses (Figures 6N-6P). Our observations are consistent with previous findings <lb/>showing that Sac2 and synaptojanin 1 have overlapping roles in the endocytic <lb/>pathway at synapses (Cao et al., 2020). Importantly, our findings indicate that <lb/>lesions associated with early onset Parkinsonism in endocytic mutants result in <lb/>abnormal ATG-9 accumulation, suggesting a possible link between this condition, <lb/>ATG-9 traffic at synapses and autophagy. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In C. elegans, ATG-9 exits the Golgi complex in an AP-3 dependent <lb/>manner.

			<body>presynaptic nerve terminals, where it plays a critical role for synaptic <lb/>autophagosome formation (Stavoe et al., 2016). Here we show that AP-3 is a <lb/>critical component of the coat that sorts ATG-9 in the vesicles targeted to <lb/>presynaptic sites in C. elegans. The C. elegans AP-3 protein complex is <lb/>structurally and mechanistically related to the mammalian AP-4 complex, which in <lb/>vertebrates is required for signal-mediated transport of ATG9 from the TGN to the <lb/>peripheral cytoplasm (Rout and Field, 2017, Dell&apos;Angelica, 2009). Invertebrates, <lb/>including C. elegans, do not have AP-4 complexes. Whether AP-3 has a role for <lb/>ATG-9 export from the Golgi complex in mammalian cells remains to be explored. <lb/>ATG-9 enriched vesicles at the synapse might represent a distinct <lb/>subpopulation of vesicles. In nerve terminals, as shown by our EM analyses, the <lb/>bulk of ATG-9 is localized in small vesicles. Interestingly, while one cannot identify <lb/>molecularly distinct vesicle populations based on size and morphological <lb/>appearance in EM, immunogold staining suggests a predominant concentration of <lb/>ATG-9 on a subpopulation of vesicles. Likewise, fluorescent microscopy revealed <lb/>only partial overlap in nerve terminals between the distribution of ATG-9 and of the <lb/>intrinsic membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, SNG-1/synaptogyrin. Consistent <lb/>with these findings, ATG-9 was identified by mass spectrometry in a synaptic <lb/>vesicle fraction obtained by immunopurification of vesicles positive for the synaptic <lb/>vesicle protein synaptophysin or by differential and Ficoll density gradient <lb/>centrifugation (Boyken et al., 2013, Chantranupong et al., 2020), suggesting <lb/>compositional overlap between ATG-9 vesicles and bona fide synaptic vesicles. <lb/></body>

			<body>Synaptically-localized ATG-9 positive vesicles undergo exo-endocytosis. <lb/>We demonstrate that their exocytosis is unc-13/unc-18-dependent, and that their <lb/>endocytosis is affected by dyn-1/dynamin, unc-26/synaptojanin, unc-57/endophilin <lb/>and unc-11/AP180, all genes required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis. In unc-26 <lb/>mutants, ATG-9 predominantly accumulates in foci which are also enriched in <lb/>clathrin. The observation that loss-of-function mutations of unc-13/unc-18 <lb/>suppress the abnormal distribution of ATG-9 in endocytic mutants shows that such <lb/>redistribution is the result of abnormal endocytosis after exocytosis. Consistent <lb/>with these findings in C. elegans, in mice a robust accumulation of ATG-9 was <lb/>detected in a subpopulation of neurons that harbor loss-of-function mutations in <lb/>the genes that encode neuronal isoforms of dynamin and synaptojanin. These <lb/>findings are also consistent with studies in non-neuronal mammalian cells showing <lb/>an accumulation of ATG9 at the plasma membrane upon perturbation of dynamin-<lb/>dependent endocytosis, as detected by fluorescence microscopy (Puri et al., 2013, <lb/>Puri et al., 2014, Popovic and Dikic, 2014) or a cell surface biotinylation assay (this <lb/>study). <lb/>The exo-endocytosis of ATG-9 at synapses reveals a link between synaptic <lb/>vesicle traffic and autophagy. We observe that disruptions in the synaptic vesicle <lb/>cycle, or autophagy, similarly result in abnormal accumulation of ATG-9 at the <lb/>plasma membrane and in clathrin-rich presynaptic foci. We interpret these clathrin-<lb/>rich foci to be endocytic intermediates onto which ATG-9 gets trapped in the <lb/>endocytic and autophagy mutants. <lb/></body>

			<body>A missense mutation in the endocytic protein synaptojanin in C. elegans <lb/>(corresponding to human R258Q associated with early-onset parkinsonism (EOP)) <lb/>results in abnormal accumulation of ATG-9 in clathrin-rich synaptic foci. <lb/>Synaptojanin contains two phosphatase domains: an inositol 5-phosphatase <lb/>domain which has been associated with most of the roles of synaptojanin in the <lb/>endocytic trafficking of synaptic vesicles, and an inositol 4-phosphate Sac1 <lb/>phosphatase domain, which can dephosphorylate to some extent also PI3P and <lb/>PI(3,5)P2, and whose precise physiological function is less understood. The <lb/>R258Q mutation, which selectively abolishes the activity of the Sac1 phosphatase <lb/>domain, was shown to impair presynaptic endocytic flow, more prominently at <lb/>inhibitory synapses, which have generally higher tonic activity (Cao et al., 2017), <lb/>and also impair autophagy (Vanhauwaert et al., 2017). Our findings are consistent <lb/>with an impact of the EOP mutation on autophagy, as we demonstrate that ATG-<lb/>9 is mislocalized at synapses both in C. elegans harboring the homologous unc-<lb/>26(R216Q) lesion and in the R258Q mutant mice. In Drosophila, the corresponding <lb/>EOP mutation in synaptojanin also resulted in neurodegeneration (Vanhauwaert <lb/>et al., 2017). In view of the role of autophagy in the control of nerve terminal health <lb/>and homeostasis, the defect in autophagy may contribute to the <lb/>neurodegeneration leading to EOP. <lb/>Together, our data support a model whereby ATG-9 couples the synaptic <lb/>exo-endocytosis and autophagy (Figure 7). ATG-9 is critical for autophagosome <lb/>biogenesis, and by trafficking via exo-endocytosis at presynaptic sites, ATG-9 <lb/></body>

			<body>The nerve ring and AIY Zone 2 were identified using anatomical landmarks <lb/>described in the original C. elegans connectome (White et al., 1986). The nerve <lb/>ring is located in the head of the animal and forms a ring of densely packed neurites <lb/>around the pharynx. AIY Zone 2 synapses are positioned in a ventral bundle of <lb/>neurites just posterior to the nerve ring. These synapses reside at the ventral base <lb/>of the neurite bundle and form a unique humped shape with multiple dense <lb/>projections. The left and right process of AIY contact one another at the posterior <lb/>end of Zone 2 synapses. Chemical synapses in C. elegans are defined by the <lb/>presence of presynaptic dense projection in the neurite. <lb/>50 nm thick sections were collected from at least one animal per genotype on <lb/>nickel slot grids covered with Formvar (EMS).

An algorithm in MATLAB was designed to identify <lb/>peaks along the line scans of Zone 2. The index of ATG-9 mislocalization at <lb/>presynaptic region is defined as the number of peaks divided by the width of peaks <lb/>at Zone 2 in each individual animal. In endocytic mutants, two populations of <lb/>mutant phenotype were identified: ATG-9 is dim and diffuse at Zone 2; ATG-9 <lb/>displays subsynaptic foci at Zone 2. Only endocytic mutants that display <lb/>subsynaptic foci were quantified for the expressivity (Figure 2K). <lb/></body>

			<body>Code <lb/>available: <lb/>https://github.com/yangsisi76/Quantify-distribution-of-cell-<lb/>structures. <lb/>Mean Intensity of ATG-9 at Zone 2 <lb/>To measure the level of ATG-9 at presynaptic regions, we obtained the fluorescent <lb/>value for individual presynaptic region (Zone 2) through segmented line scans <lb/>using Fiji. All settings for the confocal microscope and camera were kept identical <lb/>between the wild type and unc-26(s1710) mutants. Mean fluorescent value of <lb/>animals in the two genotypes was calculated by Fiji (Figure S2B). <lb/>RAB-3 and SNG-1 Enrichment at Zone 3 <lb/>To quantify the distribution and enrichment of synaptic proteins, such as RAB-3 <lb/>and SNG-1, we used methods as described (Dittman and Kaplan, 2006, Jang et <lb/>al., 2016). Briefly, fluorescent values for the RAB-3 (SNG-1) in AIY neurons were <lb/>obtained through segmented line scans using Fiji. A sliding window of 2µm was <lb/>used to identify all the fluorescent peak and trough values for Zone 3 in each <lb/>individual neuron. The synaptic enrichment was calculated as %DF/F as described <lb/>(Jang et al., 2016, Dittman and Kaplan, 2006, Bai et al., 2010). In short, all the <lb/>identified fluorescent peak and trough values (Fpeak and Ftrough) were averaged and <lb/>used to calculate the %DF/F (100 x (Fpeak -Ftrough)/ Ftrough) (Bai et al., 2010, Dittman <lb/>and Kaplan, 2006, Jang et al., 2016). All settings for the confocal microscope and <lb/>camera were kept identical between the wild type and unc-26(s1710) mutants <lb/>(Figures S3F and S5B). <lb/></body>

			<body>Percentage of ATG-9 Subsynaptic Foci that Colocalize with the Subsynaptic <lb/>Structures <lb/>To quantify the percentage of ATG-9 subsynaptic foci that colocalize with the <lb/>subsynaptic structures (LGG-1 and CHC-1), we observed the transgenic lines <lb/>olaex1360;olaIs44 <lb/>(pttx-3::gfp::lgg-1, <lb/>pttx-3::mCherry::atg-9) <lb/>and <lb/>olaex4290;olaIs34 (pttx-3::bfp::chc-1, pttx-3::atg-9::gfp). Confocal maximal <lb/>projections were used, and percentage colocalization was calculated as the <lb/>percentage of ATG-9 subsynaptic foci that colocalize with examined organelle <lb/>markers (Figure 3M). <lb/>Activity-dependent Autophagy <lb/>To measure the synaptic autophagosomes in AIY, animals with olaIs35 in the wild-<lb/>type, unc-13(e450), atg-9(wy56), unc-26(s1710) and unc-26(s1710);atg-9(wy56) <lb/>mutant backgrounds were grown in 20°C and then shifted to 25°C for 4 hours and <lb/>assessed for number of LGG-1 puncta in the neurite of AIY under a Leica DM <lb/>5000B compound microscope (Hill et al., 2019). To show the comparison between <lb/>20°C and 25°C, the number of LGG-1 puncta at 25°C in each genotype was <lb/>normalized by the number at 20°C (Figure 4L). Results before normalization are <lb/>reported in Figure S4C. <lb/>Immuno-EM <lb/></body>

			<body>To quantify the distribution of ATG-9 positive particles, animals with olaex2264 <lb/>(punc-14::atg-9::GFP) in the wild type were used. Quantifications were performed <lb/>in FIJI. Cross-sectional area: an image of a 40nm section. Particles were counted <lb/>using the Cell Counter plugin. Occasionally, a Gaussian Blur processing filter was <lb/>applied in FIJI to help visualize structures in the image. Staining specificity, <lb/>calculated as a signal to noise ratio of particle density in neuronal tissue divided <lb/>by particle density in nearby E coli in the section, was &gt;20 for all samples. Particles <lb/>were considered localized near vesicles, plasma membrane, or mitochondria if the <lb/>distance from the gold particle to that structure was &lt;20 nm. This distance was <lb/>chosen based on estimates of the size of GFP, a GFP antibody, and protein A <lb/>crystal structures. To measure the area occupied by vesicles, a freehand shape <lb/>was drawn around an apparent cluster of vesicles occupying most or all vesicles <lb/>in the neurite. To measure area occupied by plasma membrane, the perimeter of <lb/>the neurite was multiplied by 40, which accounts for the rough measured width of <lb/>the plasma membrane plus the 20 nm radius in which a particle may be localized <lb/>nearby (Figures 1G, S1A-S1D). <lb/>Quantification of Immunoreactivity in Hippocampal Neuron Culture and <lb/>GFP::CHC-1 in C. elegans <lb/>Quantification of ATG9 and CHC-1 clustering was performed using Fiji as <lb/>previously described (Cao et al., 2020). Briefly, the same threshold was applied to <lb/>all images after background subtraction and then &apos;analyze particles&apos; function of Fiji <lb/></body>

			<body>was used to obtain the raw intensity values of masked regions (Figures S3G and <lb/>6I). <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Statistical analysis and data plotting were conducted with Prism 7 software. We <lb/>used Fisher&apos;s exact test to determine statistical significance of categorical data in <lb/>contingency table, such as the penetrance of ATG-9 phenotype in AIY. 95% <lb/>confidence intervals were calculated by Wilson/Brown method and used for error <lb/>bars.
