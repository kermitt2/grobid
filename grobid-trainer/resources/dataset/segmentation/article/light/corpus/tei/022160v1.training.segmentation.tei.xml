			<body>Cultural transmission of reproductive success states that successful men have more <lb/>children and pass this higher fecundity on to their offspring. Observed in modern <lb/>human populations from genealogies and surname studies 1 , in a genetic setting <lb/>cultural transmission of reproductive success would cause particular male lines to <lb/>dominate on the Y chromosome. Balaresque and colleagues 2 interrogated a Y <lb/>chromosome dataset from Central Asia to determine whether they could reconstruct <lb/>historic instances of this behavior. Screening 8 microsatellites on the Y chromosome <lb/>in 5,321 Central Asian men (distribution in Figure 1), they identified 15 haplotypes <lb/>that were &apos;unusually frequent,&apos; which they defined as those haplotypes carried by <lb/>more than 20 men (grey bars). The authors connect these lineages to prominent <lb/>historical figures, including Genghis Khan and Giocangga. <lb/>However, high frequency haplotypes are expected simply by chance. In neutrally <lb/>evolving systems, haplotype frequency distributions follow a Zipfian power law 3 : <lb/>most lineages are carried by only a few men (Figure 1, left side), while a small <lb/>number of lineages are carried by many men (Figure 1, right side). The observed Y <lb/>chromosome distribution follows a power law, thus providing strong preliminary <lb/>evidence that this Y chromosome dataset is selectively neutral. However, to more <lb/>explicitly test whether the observed high frequency haplotypes are actually unusually <lb/>frequent, we simulated genetic data under the standard coalescent, a neutral model <lb/>that does not include cultural transmission of reproductive success. We modeled the <lb/>evolution of 5,321 Y chromosomes, each carrying 8 fully linked microsatellites, to <lb/>match the observed data. The code for these simulations, including details of <lb/>parameter values, is available online 4 . Simulations were first run across a sweep of θ <lb/>values to find the best match with the observed Y chromosome data. The least squares <lb/>fit between observed and simulated distributions was minimized at θ = 131, so one <lb/>million simulations were run at this value. We found that 27.2% of the simulations <lb/>contain 15 or more haplotypes carried by more than 20 men, thus illustrating that such <lb/>high frequency haplotypes are actually quite common. The observed Y chromosome <lb/>haplotype frequency distribution clearly falls within the 95% confidence intervals of <lb/>the simulations (Figure 1, red shading). <lb/></body>

			<body>The most parsimonious explanation is therefore that the high frequency haplotypes <lb/>observed in Central Asia are simply expected chance events, and an explanation <lb/>invoking cultural transmission of reproductive success is not necessary to account for <lb/>them. As no other evidence is presented to support proposed links to famous historical <lb/>men, these haplotypes instead most likely reflect the chance proliferation of random <lb/>male lines, probably from historically unrecorded, culturally undistinguished, but <lb/>biologically lucky Central Asian men. <lb/></body>
