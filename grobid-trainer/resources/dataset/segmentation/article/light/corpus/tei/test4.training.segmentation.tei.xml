			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The transcription factor FOXM1 is overexpressed and amplified in <lb/>many types of cancers and is a master regulator of cancer cell <lb/>division, aggressiveness, and metastasis. 1-8 FOXM1 activity <lb/>promotes all of the hallmarks of cancer, stimulating cell <lb/>proliferation, genome instability, angiogenesis, and suppressing <lb/>cell senescence. 9,10 FOXM1 action is also associated with <lb/>resistance to endocrine therapies in estrogen receptor (ER)-<lb/>positive breast cancers and with resistance to radiation and many <lb/>chemotherapies in several subtypes of breast cancer, and as well <lb/>in many other cancers. 6,11-15 We have shown that FOXM1 <lb/>increases the cancer stem cell population, drives proliferation, <lb/>motility and invasiveness, and therapy resistance, and we found <lb/>that knockdown of FOXM1 in breast cancer cells could restore <lb/>sensitivity to endocrine therapy. 15 Hence, targeting FOXM1 <lb/>activity is of great importance and could benefit many patients <lb/>whose tumors are being driven by FOXM1. To meet this clinical <lb/>need, we have therefore focused on the development of <lb/>compounds to suppress FOXM1 activities. <lb/>In our search for regulators of FOXM1 activity, we assayed <lb/>various members of a local chemical library for their inhibition of <lb/>breast cancer cell proliferation and expression of FOXM1-signature <lb/>genes, and we obtained a number of initial hits that were then <lb/>expanded to a family of 1,1-diarylethylene mono and diamines, <lb/>and their corresponding methiodide salts. These compounds were <lb/>studied further to verify their direct target engagement with <lb/>FOXM1, and structural modifications were made to improve their <lb/>cellular potency and efficacy, and their in vivo activity. <lb/>Here, we report on the FOXM1 inhibitory activity of these <lb/>compounds in cell-free and cell-based assays, and in in vivo <lb/>preclinical breast tumor models. The compounds bind directly to <lb/>FOXM1 and affect FOXM1 stability, decrease the cellular level of <lb/>FOXM1, effectively suppress proliferation and increase apoptosis <lb/>of FOXM1-containing human breast cancer cells, and block the <lb/>expression of FOXM1-regulated genes. One of the compounds <lb/>had good oral efficacy in suppressing the growth of FOXM1-<lb/>containing breast tumors in NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice, and <lb/>several others had good efficacy in tumor suppression by <lb/>subcutaneous administration. Our findings identify and character-<lb/>ize a new class of compounds that effectively antagonize FOXM1 <lb/>actions and tumor growth, and may be suitable for further clinical <lb/>evaluation in targeting aggressive breast cancers driven <lb/>by FOXM1. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Effects of compounds on proliferation of a panel of breast cells <lb/>The 1,1-diarylethylene compounds we have studied are shown in <lb/>Fig. 1a. They were obtained after FOXM1 target engagement <lb/>verification and structural optimization of initial hits from a local <lb/>chemical library that were identified through cell-based assays of <lb/>inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and FOXM1-regulated <lb/>gene expression, described below. The set of compounds is <lb/>composed of one monoamine and four diamines, in each case <lb/>with the corresponding methiodide salt that was used to optimize <lb/>their in vivo properties. <lb/>We used a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and the non-<lb/>tumorigenic MCF10A breast cell line that differed in their FOXM1 <lb/>protein content (high to intermediate levels, DT22, MCF7, T47D, <lb/>BT474, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 cells; and <lb/>low level, MCF10A cells) to examine the effects of potential <lb/>FOXM1 inhibitor compounds on cell proliferation. All cell lines are <lb/>ER-negative except for MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells (Fig. 1b). As <lb/>seen in Fig. 1c, where we monitored the effects of the earliest lead <lb/>compound, the monoamine NB-55, we found that cells with high <lb/>or intermediate levels of FOXM1 protein showed relatively similar <lb/></body>

			<body>dose-responses for inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas <lb/>MCF10A, with a low level of FOXM1, showed a reduced sensitivity <lb/>to NB-55, requiring a concentration of NB-55 five times higher to <lb/>achieve equal 50% suppression of proliferation (Fig. 1c). <lb/>Because the IC 50 for inhibition of proliferation by the mono-<lb/>amine NB-55 was only ca. 2-10 µM in the breast cancer cell lines, <lb/>we compared NB-55 with some members of the diamine series <lb/>(NB-51, 55, 65, 70, 72), as well as with their methiodide salts (NB-<lb/>63, 68, 71, 73, 115), for possible improved potency. In these <lb/>studies, we also used the FOXM1 inhibitor FDI-6 16 as a comparator <lb/>compound (Fig. 1d, e). Notably, all of the diamines were markedly <lb/>more potent than the monoamine NB-55 and also FDI-6 in <lb/>suppressing cell proliferation in both ER-negative DT22 cells and <lb/>ER-positive MCF7 cells. In these cell assays, the methiodide salts, <lb/>whether of the monoamine (NB-63) or the diamines (NB-68, 71, <lb/>73, 115), had potencies very similar to those of their parent amine <lb/>compounds. Dose-response antiproliferative studies in additional <lb/>cell lines beyond the ER-positive MCF7 and the basal/claudin low <lb/>triple negative DT22 cells gave similar findings. Thus, in triple <lb/>negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, IC 50 <lb/>values for the monoamine NB-55 were 3-5 µM, whereas the <lb/>diamines and their methiodide salts gave IC 50 values of 0.6 ± <lb/>0.14 µM, very similar to those observed with MCF7 and DT22 cells. <lb/>Of interest, the diamine salt tested, NB-73, also effectively <lb/>suppressed the proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast <lb/>cancer cells, whose growth was weakly stimulated rather than <lb/>suppressed by trans-hydroxytamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. 1). 17 <lb/>Analysis of gene expression using NB-55, NB-73, NB-115, and <lb/>FDI-6 for comparison, at their IC 50 concentration for suppression <lb/>of cell proliferation, showed that they significantly reduced the <lb/>expression of classic FOXM1 stimulated target genes 15,18,19 <lb/>(FOXM1C, AURKB, CCNB1, and PLK1) and increased expression <lb/>of ATF3, a gene suppressed by FOXM1 (Fig. 1f). <lb/>Direct binding of compounds to FOXM1 and increased <lb/>FOXM1 sensitivity to proteolysis upon compound binding <lb/>We used two approaches to investigate whether these antipro-<lb/>liferative compounds were engaging FOXM1 directly. First, we <lb/>developed a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy trans-<lb/>fer (tr-FRET) assay for direct FOXM1 binding. We adapted the <lb/>diamine compound NB-72 to create an acceptor fluorophore Fl-<lb/>NB-72 by replacing one amine appendage with fluorescein, and <lb/>we attached a terbium donor to purified, full length FOXM1 <lb/>through a streptavidin-biotin linker. FOXM1 titrations showed that <lb/>Fl-NB-72 bound to the FOXM1 protein with high affinity (K d = <lb/>23 nM) (Fig. 2a). <lb/>The FOXM1 interaction of the ten compounds we had studied <lb/>were assessed by a competition assay, monitoring the decrease in <lb/>FRET signal as a fixed concentration of Fl-NB-72 was displaced by <lb/>increasing concentrations of compound. Representative examples <lb/>are shown in Fig. 2b. The K i values, calculated from the IC 50 values, <lb/>are given for all compounds in Supplementary Table 1. The mono <lb/>and diamines and their methiodide salts have high binding affinity <lb/>for FOXM1, with K i values in the submicromolar range; the <lb/>Fig. 1 Compounds studied and effects of the compounds on inhibition of cell proliferation and regulation of FOXM1 target gene expression. <lb/>a Structures of the 1,1-diarylethylene monoamine, diamines, and their methiodide salts we have studied. b Western blot analysis shows that <lb/>the cell lines differ in their relative content of FOXM1 protein and in the expression of ERα. c Inhibition of cell proliferation by NB-55 examined <lb/>in dose-response studies in these cell lines.

			<body>methiodide salts of the diamines bind with higher affinity than the <lb/>diamines themselves. <lb/>We also examined the effect of these compounds on the level <lb/>of intracellular FOXM1 and on the proteolytic lability of FOXM1 in <lb/>cell extracts. Treatment of cell extracts with NB-73 rendered the <lb/>FOXM1 protein more readily proteolyzed by pronase (Fig. 2c), <lb/>suggesting that binding of compound to FOXM1 destabilizes its <lb/>structure and increases the ease with which it can be degraded by <lb/>pronase. Likewise, exposure of cells (MDA-MB-231 or MCF7) to NB-<lb/>55, NB-73, or NB-115 reduced the intracellular level of FOXM1 <lb/>over time (Fig. 2d, e), whereas the intracellular level of a different <lb/>forkhead protein, FOXA1, was not altered by these compounds <lb/>(Fig. 2e). Of interest, intracellular FOXM1 protein level was <lb/>minimally affected by FDI-6 exposure of cells (Fig. 2d), suggesting <lb/>that our compounds and FDI-6 have somewhat different <lb/>mechanisms of action. Also, as shown in Fig. 2f, cotreatment of <lb/>cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the down-<lb/>regulation of cellular FOXM1 by NB-73. <lb/>RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of compounds and of siFOXM1 on <lb/>global FOXM1 gene regulation <lb/>We next used RNA-Seq to examine the effects of these <lb/>compounds on gene regulation more globally. Because full <lb/>FOXM1 depletion results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death, 20 <lb/>we used concentrations of compounds that suppressed cell <lb/>proliferation by about 60%. As seen in the heat maps in Fig. 3a, <lb/>NB-73 regulated FOXM1 RNA-signature genes at 9 h and even <lb/>more strongly at 24 h in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, as <lb/>shown in the Venn diagram (Fig. 3b), there was extensive overlap <lb/>in the genes regulated more than 2-fold and with FDRs &lt; 0.05 by <lb/>NB-73, NB-55, and FDI-6. Notably, 72% of genes regulated by NB-<lb/>55 and 48% of genes regulated by FDI-6 overlapped with NB-73 <lb/>Fig. 2 Fluorescence assays of binding of compounds to FOXM1 protein. a Direct binding of Fl-NB-72 to FOXM1 by tr-FRET (n = 2, error bars ± <lb/>SD). b Representative competitive binding assays of compounds using Fl-NB-72 as the tr-FRET probe (n = 2, error bars ± SD). c DARTS assay <lb/>showing increased susceptibility of FOXM1 protein to degradation by pronase upon exposure of cell extracts to NB-73. β-Actin in cell extracts <lb/>is also shown for comparison. d Effect of treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with NB-55 (5 µM), NB-73 (1.5 µM), or FDI-6 (8 µM) on FOXM1 level or <lb/>e treatment of MCF7 cells with NB-55 (8 µM), NB-73 (4 µM), NB-115 (4 µM) on the cellular level of FOXM1 or FOXA1 protein (a different <lb/>forkhead protein for comparison) monitored by Western blot over time. f Reversal of the downregulation of FOXM1 by cotreatment of MDA-<lb/>MB-231 cells with NB-73 (1.5 or 3 µM) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (1 µM) for 16 h.

			<body>regulated genes, indicating that these compounds regulated <lb/>many similar genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) and <lb/>Enrichment Scores for gene regulations by NB-73 or siFOXM1 <lb/>treatment of cells are shown in Fig. 3c. These analyses testing the <lb/>differential gene expression data against gene sets consisting of <lb/>FOXM1 target genes revealed negative enrichment scores, <lb/>indicating that NB-73 and siFOXM1 downregulate expression of <lb/>genes in the FOXM1 cistrome. The major categories of gene <lb/>regulations, identified by Gene Ontology analysis and shown in <lb/>the reduce and visualize gene ontologies (REVIGO) plots (Fig. 3d <lb/>and Supplementary Fig. 2), included proliferation, G2/M transition <lb/>of mitotic cell cycle, apoptosis, regulation of transcription, DNA <lb/>replication and DNA repair, activities well known to be under <lb/>FOXM1 regulation. 21 <lb/>Effects of compounds on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and on nuclear <lb/>localization of FOXM1 <lb/>As seen in Fig. 4, the compounds had a marked effect on the cell <lb/>cycle and also on the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis. In <lb/>Fig. 4 Compound NB-73 increases the percent of cells in G2/M and reduces the percent of cells in S phase of the cell cycle, and increases <lb/>apoptosis, but does not change the nuclear localization of the FOXM1 present. a MDA-MB-231 cells were synchronized by double thymidine <lb/>block and were released for 24 h with or without treatment with vehicle or NB-73 (at 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 µM). The percent of cells in different <lb/>phases of the cell cycle were monitored by flow cytometry. n = 4 experiments, mean + SD. b Cells were treated with or without NB-73 (at 1.5 <lb/>or 3 µM) for 24 h or 72 h and the percent of apoptotic cells was monitored by AnnexinV/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. n = 3 <lb/>experiments, mean + SD. c Caspase 3/7 activity was monitored after cell treatment with or without NB-73 (at 1.5 or 3 µM) for 24 h using <lb/>Caspase Glo assay. n = 2 experiments, mean + SD; t-test **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001. d NB-73 treatment (2 µM for 24 h) of MDA-MB-231 cells results <lb/>in a decrease of p-FOXM1, observed by immunofluorescent staining (Scale bar = 50 µm). Nuclei from four fields for vehicle and NB-73 treated <lb/>cells were analyzed using the Image J fluorescent analysis tool, the average CTCF (corrected total cell fluorescence) was calculated, and data <lb/>were statistically analyzed by paired t-test. e Treatment with NB-55, NB-73, or NB-115 or FDI6 for 24 h does not change the intracellular <lb/>localization of FOXM1, which remains largely nuclear, as observed by Western blot of nuclear extracts (NE) and cytoplasmic extracts (CE) of <lb/>cells after 24 h. By contrast, β-Actin is largely in the CE, as expected. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 4a, cells were synchronized by double thymidine block and <lb/>were then released for 24 h with or without treatment with NB-73 <lb/>at three different concentrations (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 µM). Flow <lb/>cytometry analysis (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4) <lb/>showed that compound treatment resulted in a large increase in <lb/>the percent of cells in G2/M, and decrease in the percent of cells in <lb/>S phase, consistent with the compounds inhibiting FOXM1 <lb/>activity. 9,22 FOXM1 is a key regulator of G1/S and G2/M transitions <lb/>and M phase progression and FOXM1 binds to many G2/M <lb/>promoters. 8,9 Treatment with NB-73 also increased the percent of <lb/>apoptotic cells observed at 24 h or 72 h (Fig. 4b) and caspase 3/7 <lb/>activity (Fig. 4c). <lb/>Of note, treatment with NB-73 decreased the expression of <lb/>phospho-FOXM1, considered the biologically active form of <lb/>FOXM1, as observed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4d), consistent <lb/>with western blot findings in Fig. 2d, e that NB-73 treatment <lb/>decreased FOXM1. Despite the change in amount of FOXM1 <lb/>protein with NB-73 exposure, FOXM1 protein was always found in <lb/>the nucleus and showed the same, greater than 90%, nuclear <lb/>localization as observed in control vehicle treated cells both by <lb/>immunofluorescence (Fig. 4d) and by biochemical fractionation of <lb/>cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 4e). <lb/>Pharmacokinetics of compounds <lb/>In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice, we found that some <lb/>compounds showed very good subcutaneous and oral bioavail-<lb/>ability (Fig. 5). Examination of compound half-lives and accumula-<lb/>tion in plasma after a single subcutaneous injection or oral <lb/>administration of the parent mono-and diamines (NB-55, 65, 70, <lb/>72, and 51) revealed good and rather equivalent PK by either <lb/>route of administration. It is striking that the PK properties of the <lb/>monoamine NB-55, particularly after oral dosing, were markedly <lb/>Fig. 5 Pharmacokinetics and half-lives of compounds in mice after s.c. or oral administration of amine compounds and their respective <lb/>methiodide salts.

Multiple plasma samples were collected from each <lb/>mouse (n = 4) over the course of 48 h after compound was administered. Compounds were quantified using LC-MS/MS.

			<body>superior to those of the diamines. Of note as well, conversion of <lb/>the mono-and diamines to their methiodide salts improved their <lb/>PK behavior after subcutaneous administration; the oral bioavail-<lb/>ability of these salts, however, was diminished (Fig. 5). Hence, after <lb/>s.c. injection of NB-63, NB-68, NB-71, NB-73, and NB-115, very <lb/>high blood levels of compound were observed, followed by long <lb/>half-lives (from~25-40 h, Fig. 5), whereas only very low levels <lb/>were found after oral administration. In contrast, the FOXM1 <lb/>inhibitor FDI-6 achieved only very low blood levels after s.c. <lb/>administration at 20 mg/kg, and was undetectable after oral <lb/>administration at 40 mg/kg (and therefore not shown) (Supple-<lb/>mentary Fig. 4). <lb/>Efficacy of compounds in suppressing the growth of human breast <lb/>tumor xenografts and FOXM1-regulated gene expression in <lb/>tumors <lb/>Studies in female NOD/SCID-gamma (NSG) mice showed that the <lb/>monoamine NB-55, when given orally daily, very effectively <lb/>suppressed the growth of human breast tumor xenografts (Fig. <lb/>6a). We also tested lower doses of the diammonium salts NB-68, <lb/>NB-71, and NB-73 as tumor suppressive agents, since these <lb/>compounds had higher inherent cellular potencies and achieved <lb/>higher blood levels after s.c. dosing than did NB-55. At 20 mg/kg <lb/>every other day for 10 days and then 10 mg/kg every other day <lb/>subsequently, NB-68, NB-71, and NB-73 were found to greatly <lb/>suppress tumor growth (Fig. 6b). Because of their effectiveness, we <lb/>next treated animals with 5 and 10 mg/kg of NB-73 s.c. daily and <lb/>then every other day starting on day 21. As seen in Fig. 6c, NB-73 <lb/>reduced tumor growth at 5 mg/kg and more markedly suppressed <lb/>growth at 10 mg/kg. Accompanying this suppression of tumor <lb/>growth by NB-73, the expression of FOXM1-regulated genes, <lb/>including the FOXM1 gene itself, was reduced in tumors in a dose-<lb/>dependent manner, with all gene expressions being greatly <lb/>reduced upon treatment with 10 mg/kg NB-73 (Fig. 6d). Low <lb/>doses of NB-63 and NB-115, compounds that showed good PK <lb/>properties with high blood levels and long half-lives, were also <lb/>effective in suppressing the growth of tumor xenografts <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 5) and had little impact on animal body <lb/>weight. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study presents a new class of 1,1-diarylethylene mono-and <lb/>diamine compounds that function as effective suppressors of <lb/>FOXM1 activities. These compounds and their methiodide salts <lb/>bind directly to FOXM1 protein, labilize it towards proteolytic <lb/>degradation, and reverse patterns of FOXM1-regulated gene <lb/>expression. They also suppress breast cancer cell proliferation <lb/>and increase apoptosis, and they retard the growth of breast <lb/>xenograft tumors in an experimental preclinical mouse model <lb/>where we show that FOXM1-mediated gene expression is <lb/>suppressed in these growth-inhibited tumors. <lb/>Fig. 6 Compounds NB-55, NB-68, NB-71, and NB-73 suppress breast tumor xenograft growth and the expression of FOXM1-regulated genes. <lb/>Human breast cancer DT22 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of intact 7-week-old NSG mice and mice bearing DT22 tumors were <lb/>dosed in a daily and then every other day from day 7 on with 100 mg/kg of NB-55 or control vehicle by oral gavage; or b with NB-68, NB-71, <lb/>or NB-73 by s.c. injection at 40 mg/kg daily for 4 days and then 20 mg/kg every third day until day 13 and then 10 mg/kg every third day, or <lb/>with control vehicle. Tumor volumes in Veh and compound treated animals were monitored (2-way ANOVA, Dunnett&apos;s post-test, **P &lt; 0.01). In <lb/>c, animals were treated with low doses of NB-73 (5 or 10 mg/kg s.c. daily and then every other day after day 21).

			<body>Several lines of evidence indicate that our compounds are <lb/>targeting FOXM1 and fulfill characteristics expected for validated <lb/>chemical probes for this target protein. 23,24 By a cell-free FRET <lb/>binding assay, we show that the FOXM1 inhibitory compounds <lb/>bind directly to FOXM1 with affinities commensurate with their <lb/>cellular potencies. Treatment of cells with these compounds <lb/>reduced the intracellular level of FOXM1 and exposure of cell <lb/>extracts to these compounds increased FOXM1 degradation by <lb/>pronase, as observed in the drug affinity responsive target stability <lb/>(DARTS) protease sensitivity assay. 25 This implies that compound <lb/>binding is perturbing the structure of FOXM1 to make it more <lb/>readily proteolyzed, which matches the fact that they also <lb/>decrease the intracellular level of FOXM1 protein. Of interest, <lb/>antiestrogen SERD compounds also inhibit and promote degrada-<lb/>tion of their target protein, ERα 26,27 by conformational disordering <lb/>of the ligand-binding domain. Similar order-to-disorder conforma-<lb/>tional changes in FOXM1, recently shown to regulate its <lb/>transcriptional activity, are likely being affected by our compounds <lb/>in ways that also block FOXM1 activity and accelerate its <lb/>degradation. 28 Also, gene regulation by NB-73 and NB-55, studied <lb/>in greatest detail, showed substantial overlap with that of FDI-6, <lb/>shown previously to target FOXM1, 16 and with siFOXM1 treatment <lb/>of cells. Cell cycle analysis, showing an increase in the proportion <lb/>of cells in G2/M after treatment with NB-73, is also consistent with <lb/>FOXM1 activity being inhibited by NB-73. However, we do not yet <lb/>know if our compounds affect only FOXM1, although they show <lb/>selectivity in reducing intracellular FOXM1 without changing the <lb/>intracellular level of another important forkhead transcription <lb/>factor, FOXA1. In addition to regulating the expression of many <lb/>genes that promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression, <lb/>FOXM1 can also influence these processes through its interactions <lb/>with other key cellular proteins such as SMAD3 and β-catenin. 3 <lb/>Possible effects of our NB compounds on altering the activity of <lb/>FOXM1 through these protein interactions remain to be studied in <lb/>future investigations. <lb/>Of the amine compounds studied that showed good potency <lb/>(IC 50 values less than 0.5 μM) and efficacy in cells in culture, several <lb/>had good in vivo PK properties. Although NB-55 and NB-65 <lb/>showed good PK properties (half-lives and blood levels achieved) <lb/>after s.c. administration, only NB-55 showed good PK properties <lb/>after oral administration. Notably, the salts of all of the amine <lb/>compounds had greatly (5-50×) elevated blood levels and long <lb/>half-lives (t ½ = 24-39 h) by s.c. route. However, these salts showed <lb/>very low bioavailability (blood levels) by oral route. Because of <lb/>their high and prolonged blood levels, NB-63, NB-68, NB-71, NB-<lb/>73, and NB-115 were able to greatly suppress tumor growth <lb/>in vivo using low doses (2-20 mg/kg) administered s.c. daily or <lb/>every other day. By contrast, NB-55 required daily s.c. or oral <lb/>treatment at 100 mg/kg for effective tumor suppression, whereas <lb/>20 or 40 mg/kg doses were found to be only marginally effective <lb/>(data not shown), consistent with its good but not outstanding <lb/>blood levels and its 5-fold reduced potency in suppression of cell <lb/>proliferation, as seen in dose-response studies in cells in culture. <lb/>Of note, we observed that FDI-6, for which no prior in vivo data <lb/>have been published, 16 showed potency similar to NB-55 in cells <lb/>in culture but achieved only very low blood levels after s.c. or oral <lb/>administration. <lb/>Of interest, the FOXM1 activity-regulating compounds <lb/>described in this manuscript were able to function as suppressors <lb/>of breast cancer cell proliferation and the expression of FOXM1-<lb/>signature genes and gene ontologies in a broad range of breast <lb/>cancer subtypes, both hormone receptor-positive (such as MCF7 <lb/>and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7) and triple negative (such as DT22 <lb/>and MDA-MB-231), as well as in BT474 (ER-positive, HER2-positive) <lb/>cells, where similar IC 50 concentrations for inhibition of cell <lb/>proliferation and FOXM1-regulated gene expressions were <lb/>observed. Indeed, there is considerable evidence for the <lb/>deleterious impact of high tumor FOXM1 on patient clinical <lb/>outcome in ER-positive breast cancers, 15,29,30 in HER2-positive <lb/>breast cancers, 31 and in triple negative breast cancers. 32 FOXM1 is <lb/>also a key player in many other cancers, including glioblastoma, <lb/>ovarian, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancers, and pan-<lb/>creatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 6,7,11,14,33,34 for which there are <lb/>currently few optimal treatments. Hence, compounds that inhibit <lb/>FOXM1 activities might prove to be broadly useful in a variety of <lb/>cancer types. <lb/>In this study, we found that these compounds were effective <lb/>antitumor agents when administered alone at low micromolar <lb/>doses in several breast cancer subtypes; nevertheless, it will be of <lb/>interest to test them in combination treatments targeting ER-<lb/>positive, recurrent metastatic endocrine therapy-resistant breast <lb/>cancers and aggressive triple negative breast cancers, when <lb/>administered with other current standard-of-care treatments. For <lb/>example, combinations of these FOXM1 inhibitors with Fulves-<lb/>trant, Letrozole, PI3K inhibitors, or CDK4/6 inhibitors 35,36 might <lb/>enable improved tumor sensitivity and response, since we and <lb/>others have shown that knockdown of FOXM1 or inhibition of <lb/>FOXM1 activity with an ARF inhibitory peptide in cells in culture <lb/>could restore sensitivity to tamoxifen in tamoxifen-resistant breast <lb/>cancer cells. 15 Since FOXM1 has been found to reduce cancer <lb/>responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents and to radiation, 13,37 <lb/>inhibition of FOXM1 activity in triple negative breast cancers <lb/>might likewise reduce the amounts of chemotherapy drugs or <lb/>radiation needed, thereby improving cancer treatment and <lb/>perhaps reducing undesirable side effects of many current drug <lb/>therapies. <lb/>The compounds we have developed suppress FOXM1 activities <lb/>and have favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Hence, these new <lb/>compounds offer intriguing translational opportunities for the <lb/>development of new anticancer agents, either as mono or <lb/>combination therapies targeting FOXM1 actions that drive <lb/>aggressive forms of breast cancer, as well as other cancers. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Cell lines and cell culture methods <lb/>All breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and were <lb/>maintained and cultured as described. 15,38,39 DT22 cells were derived from <lb/>a human triple negative invasive ductal breast carcinoma and were grown <lb/>in culture as described. 40 All cells were tested for mycoplasma using Real-<lb/>Time PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Akron Biotech, Boca Raton, FL). <lb/>Chemical synthesis of compounds <lb/>Full details on the preparation and spectroscopic characterization of all <lb/>compounds are given in the Supplementary Information. <lb/>Cell viability assay <lb/>WST-1 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used to quantify cell viability <lb/>as described. 38 Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a VICTOR X5 <lb/>PerkinElmer 2030 Multilabel Plate Reader. All assays were performed in <lb/>triplicate and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 8.0. <lb/>Western blot and Immunofluorescence assays <lb/>For Western blot analysis, whole-cell extracts were prepared using 1X RIPA <lb/>lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor <lb/>cocktail (Millipore Sigma). Proteins were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE <lb/>gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. In some cases, <lb/>treatments with compound were done in the presence of the proteasome <lb/>inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) as described in the figure legend. Western <lb/>blotting used antibodies against FOXM1 (Abcam 184637, 1:1000; Cell <lb/>Signaling Technologies Catalog #5436, D12D5, 1:1000), ERα (Santa Cruz <lb/>Catalog #sc543, HC-20, 1:1000), FOXA1 (Abcam 23738, 1:1000), and β-actin <lb/>(Millipore-Sigma A2228, 1:10,000) as an internal loading control. Both <lb/>IRDye 800 CW goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (LI-COR, Cat# 926-<lb/>32211) and IRDye 680 CW goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (LI-COR, <lb/>Cat# 926-68070) were diluted (1:5000) for incubation with the blots.

			<body>intensities were analyzed with Licor Odyssey 2.1 software. All blots shown <lb/>together derive from the same experiment and were processed in parallel. <lb/>Full uncropped images of blots are shown as supplementary figures in the <lb/>Supplementary Information file. Molecular weight markers were Rainbow <lb/>markers from GE Healthcare (38-225 kDa) or Precision Plus Dual Color <lb/>Markers from Biorad (37-250 kDa). <lb/>Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were performed <lb/>as described. 41 Briefly, for immunofluorescence detection of FOXM1 in <lb/>cells, cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi, Verona, WI), fixed in <lb/>4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100. The cells <lb/>were then blocked, treated with primary antibody to phospho-FOXM1 (Cell <lb/>Signaling Technology Catalog #14655, D9M6G 1:100) followed by a <lb/>fluorescently-tagged secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch 711-<lb/>546-152, 1:500), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before imaging. <lb/>Three dimensional Z stacks were compressed, the compressed images <lb/>were exported to Image J, and the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) <lb/>was calculated for each individual cell or nucleus. Data were statistically <lb/>analyzed as indicated in the figure legend. <lb/>Fluorescence binding assays with FOXM1 <lb/>Competitive binding assays of compound binding to FOXM1 by tr-FRET <lb/>were done in FRET buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% NP-40 <lb/>detergent, 10% glycerol) with 0.3 mg/ml ovalbumin and 0.1 mM butylated <lb/>hydroxy-anisole added fresh daily. Solutions of the protein, fluorescent <lb/>probe and compound dilutions were prepared at 3× concentrations, the <lb/>final dilution taking place as they were mixed together in equal portions <lb/>on the microtiter plate. <lb/>A stock solution of biotin-FOXM1 was prepared and stored at 5.6 μM at <lb/>−80°C. For the assay, it was diluted to be 5 nM final concentration, with <lb/>1.25 nM tetravalent streptavidin-terbium (SaTb). The compounds were <lb/>prepared at 7 × 10 −4 M in DMF (dimethylformamide) and then serially <lb/>diluted into FRET buffer plus 2% DMF to ensure solubility. Final <lb/>concentrations were 10 −5 M to 10 −9 M, with the last point being buffer <lb/>only, no compound. Fluorescein-NB-72 (Fl-NB-72) was prepared at 1 mM <lb/>in DMF and stored at −20°C. It was diluted into FRET buffer to give 100 nM <lb/>in the assay. Incubations were done in duplicate on black Molecular <lb/>Devices 96-well microtiter plates. 5 μl of Fl-NB-72 and 5 μl of the <lb/>compound dilutions, were mixed together on the plate. To this was added <lb/>5 µl biotin-FoxM1 and incubated in the dark at room temperature, for 1 h. <lb/>Time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (tr-FRET) measurements <lb/>were with a Victor X5 plate reader (Perkin Elmer), with an excitation filter at <lb/>340/10 nm and emission filters for terbium and fluorescein at 495/20 and <lb/>520/25 nm, respectively, with a 100-μs delay in data acquisition. To correct <lb/>for background signals, biotin-FOXM1 was omitted, and diffusion-<lb/>enhanced FRET incubations were done in duplicate on black Molecular <lb/>Devices 96-well microtiter plates. Five microliter of Fl-NB-72 and 5 μl of the <lb/>compound solutions were mixed together and then 5 µl of FRET buffer <lb/>plus SaTb was added, mixed and incubated in the dark at room <lb/>temperature, for 1 h. The tr-FRET signals measured as above were <lb/>subtracted as a background from the first incubations that contained <lb/>biotin-FOXM1. Graphs were prepared using Graph Pad/Prism 4. <lb/>The Ki was calculated by the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Ki (compound) = <lb/>IC50 (compound)/(1 + T0/Kd (Fl-NB-72)); T0 is the concentration of Fl-NB-<lb/>72 and Kd(Fl-NB-72) is its binding affinity for FOXM1, determined below. <lb/>In direct binding experiments for determination of the Kd for Fl-NB-72, <lb/>the Fl-NB-72 ligand was diluted into FRET buffer + 2% DMF, to give <lb/>concentrations 3× of final. The biotin-FOXM1 was diluted to a concentra-<lb/>tion of 3 × (5 nM + 1.25 nM SaTb). 5 μl of each of these were mixed on a <lb/>black Molecular Devices microtiter plate with 5 μl of FRET buffer, so that <lb/>each component was diluted 3×. Each point was prepared in duplicate, <lb/>mixed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. tr-FRET was <lb/>measured on a Victor X5 microtiter plate reader with settings as <lb/>given above. <lb/>Drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay <lb/>The DARTS assay was performed as described 25 to examine the effect of <lb/>compounds on the stability of FOXM1 to proteolysis by exogenous <lb/>pronase. Cell lysates were incubated without or with compound for 1 h at <lb/>room temperature, and with varying concentrations of pronase (none; <lb/>1:10 3 ; 1:3 × 10 3 ; 1:5 × 10 3 ; 1:10 4 ; and 1:10 5 dilution of a 12.5 mg/ml pronase <lb/>solution) for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were then <lb/>separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels and gels were exposed to FOXM1 <lb/>antibody (Genetex GTX102170, 1:750) and β-actin antibody (1:500, mouse <lb/>monoclonal). <lb/>Cell cycle analysis <lb/>Cells were synchronized by double thymidine block prior to cell cycle <lb/>analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. Briefly, the cells were blocked <lb/>with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h, then released with fresh media for 8 h <lb/>followed by re-blocking with thymidine for another 16 h. Following the <lb/>second block, the cells were released with or without treatments with the <lb/>NB compounds and cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at the <lb/>time points indicated. After alcohol fixation for 2 h, the cells were washed <lb/>with cold 1XPBS followed by staining with 50 µg/ml PI solution in PBS with <lb/>addition of 5 µg/ml RNAse A for at least 4 h. The cells were then analyzed <lb/>by the Flow Cytometry analyzer BD LSR II for percentage of cells in G1/G0, <lb/>S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. <lb/>Apoptosis analysis <lb/>The cells were analyzed for percentage of apoptotic cells following 24 h or <lb/>72 h of vehicle or compound treatment by staining with the Alexa Fluor® <lb/>488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Thermo Fisher) and flow cytometry <lb/>according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. Caspase activity in the cells after <lb/>treatment with control vehicle or compounds was determined using the <lb/>Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay system (Promega) in a 96-well format following the <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 exemplify the <lb/>gating strategy used for the cell cycle and apoptosis flow cytometry <lb/>analyses. <lb/>Cytoplasmic and Nuclear extract preparation <lb/>Cells treated with vehicle or compounds were collected for preparation of <lb/>cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Briefly, cells were washed with ice cold <lb/>PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. Following removal of the <lb/>supernatant, the cell pellets were resuspended in 150-200 µL of cold CE <lb/>buffer (HEPES [10 mM] pH 7.9, KCI [10 mM], EDTA [0.1 mM], NP-40 0.3% <lb/>(added just before use) and 1X protease inhibitors (added just before use)) <lb/>and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for <lb/>5 min and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was harvested. The pellets <lb/>were washed twice in 100 µl of CE buffer without NP-40. After removal of <lb/>supernatant, pellets were resuspended in 20-40 µl of NE buffer (HEPES <lb/>[20 mM] pH 7.9, NaCl [0.4 mM], EDTA [1 mM], glycerol 25%, 1X protease <lb/>inhibitors (added just before use)) and incubated on ice for 10 min, <lb/>followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and harvest of <lb/>supernatant (nuclear extract). All centrifugations were done at 4 C. <lb/>RNA isolation and real-time PCR <lb/>Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed <lb/>using MMTV reverse transcriptase (New England BioLabs). Real-time PCR <lb/>was performed using SYBRgreen PCR Master Mix (Quantabio) as <lb/>described. 15 Relative mRNA levels of genes were normalized to the <lb/>housekeeping gene 36B4, and fold-change calculated relative to the <lb/>vehicle treated samples. Results are the average ± SD from at least two <lb/>independent experiments carried out in triplicate. Primer sequences for <lb/>the genes studied were obtained from the Harvard Primer Bank. <lb/>Sequences are available on their website. <lb/>RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling and gene ontology analysis <lb/>For gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted from cells using <lb/>Trizol reagent and further cleaned using the Turbo DNase and RNAqueous <lb/>kits (ThermoFisher). Cells were treated with Veh (0.1% EtOH), or with the <lb/>compounds indicated for 9 h or 24 h. Once the sample quality and <lb/>replicate reproducibility were verified, samples from each group were <lb/>subjected to sequencing. RNA at a concentration of 100 ng/µl in nuclease-<lb/>free water was used for library construction. cDNA libraries were prepared <lb/>with the mRNA-TruSeq Kit (Illumina, Inc.). In brief, the poly-A containing <lb/>mRNA was purified from total RNA, the RNA was fragmented, double-<lb/>stranded cDNA was generated from fragmented RNA, and adapters were <lb/>ligated to the ends. <lb/>The paired-end read data from the HiSeq 4000 were processed and <lb/>analyzed through a series of steps. Base calling and de-multiplexing of <lb/>samples within each lane were done with Casava 1.8.2. The RNA sequences <lb/>were prepared with Illumina&apos;s TruSeq Stranded mRNAseq Sample Prep kit. <lb/>Reads were trimmed of adapters and low expression data using <lb/></body>

			<body>Trimmomatic version 0.38. 42 The STAR alignment tool version 2.5.3a was <lb/>used to align the sequenced reads to the GRCh37 human genome from <lb/>Ensembl. 43 Gene counts were calculated using subread version 1.5.2. 44,45 <lb/>The edgeR Bioconductor package in R was used for normalization and <lb/>differential expression analysis. Default normalization methods were used, <lb/>specifically trimmed mean of M values or TMM was used to calculate the <lb/>normalized expression values.

Overrepresented gene ontology (GO) <lb/>biological processes were determined by the web-based DAVID Bioinfor-<lb/>matics Resources database. 49,50 REVIGO (Reduce and Visualize Gene <lb/>Ontologies) was utilized to visualize overrepresented GO biological <lb/>processes. 51 <lb/>Pharmacokinetic studies <lb/>All experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with <lb/>National Institutes of Health (NIH) standards for the care and use of animals, <lb/>with protocols approved by the University of Illinois IACUC. The pharmaco-<lb/>kinetics of compounds were monitored after single dose administration into <lb/>female CD1 mice (7-9 weeks of age) via s.c. injection or oral gavage, as <lb/>described. 39 For s.c. injection, each compound was dissolved in DMSO and <lb/>then mixed with corn oil for a total injection volume of 100 μL (10% DSMO + <lb/>90% corn oil) per mouse. For oral gavage, compounds were administered in a <lb/>200 µL formulation of 9/0.5/0.5/90 parts of PEG400/Tween80/Povidone/0.5% <lb/>Carboxymethylcellulose in DI water. Multiple plasma samples were collected <lb/>from each mouse (n = 4 for each experiment) over the course of 48 h after <lb/>compound administration.
