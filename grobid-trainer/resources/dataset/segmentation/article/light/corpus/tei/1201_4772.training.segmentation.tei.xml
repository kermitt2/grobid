			<front>t t pair production cross section measurement at the LHC <lb/>Tae Jeong Kim 1,a <lb/>Korea University, Seoul <lb/>Abstract. Measurement of tt pair production cross sections with an integrated luminosity of around 1 fb −1 at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 7 TeV obtained with the ATLAS and CMS detectors are reported. The inclusive cross sections in dilepton <lb/>(ee, eµ, µµ and µτ), lepton+jets (e, µ) and all hadronic decay modes are measured. In addition to inclusive cross <lb/>section measurement, the study of jet multiplicity with additional jets are also presented, which is important to <lb/>constrain the initial state radiation. Measurement of the charge asymmetry at the LHC is also presented. All <lb/>measurements are compatible with Standard Model predictions. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accumulated the data <lb/>corresponding to an integrated luminosity of almost 1 fb −1 <lb/>in both experiments ATLAS and CMS by the summer in <lb/>2011 for HCP2011. At the LHC, the tt production cross <lb/>section at <lb/>√ <lb/>s = 7 TeV is predicted to be 164.6 pb by <lb/>approximate next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO) calcula-<lb/>tion and 157.5 pb by next-leading-order (NLO) calcula-<lb/>tion. The cross section measurement of tt is important for <lb/>testing the perturbative QCD which is successful so far <lb/>and searching for new physics. Any deviation would in-<lb/>dicate possible new physics. It is crucial to measure the <lb/>cross section in all decay modes since new physics can ap-<lb/>pear in any different decay modes. Top quark decays al-<lb/>most exclusively to W boson ans b quark. Therefore, the <lb/>decay mode entirely depending on W boson branching ra-<lb/>tio. In dilepton decay mode (ee, eµ, µµ), tau leptonic de-<lb/>cay is included. Considering Br(τ → lν l ν τ ) = 0.35, the <lb/>branching ratio would be 6.8%, 3.8%, 30% and 44% for <lb/>dilepton, lepton+tau, lepton+jets and all hadronic decay <lb/>modes, respectively. In addition to inclusive cross section, <lb/>the jet multiplicity distribution of tt with additional jets in <lb/>lepton+jets decay mode is shown, which is important mea-<lb/>surement to constrain the initial state radiation (ISR). As <lb/>the deviation has been observed by Tevatron, the charge <lb/>asymmetry measurement at the LHC are also performed <lb/>using the fact that the width of top quark is slightly broader <lb/>than anti-top quark in rapidity distribution at the LHC. <lb/>2 Samples &amp; Objects <lb/>At ATLAS, MC@NLO is interfaced with HERWIG (PS) <lb/>and JIMMY (UE). Approximate NNLO of 164.6 pb is used <lb/>for normalization. At CMS, the signal sample of tt is mod-<lb/>eled by MADGRAPH with PYTHIA matching up to three <lb/>additional partons. NLO cross section of 157.5 pb is used <lb/>for normalization. In both experiments, the τ decay is han-<lb/>dled by TAUOLA and top quark mass is assumed to be <lb/>172.5 GeV/c 2 . <lb/></body>

			<body>In top quark analysis, almost all physics objects are <lb/>used except photons. At ATLAS, the absolute pseudo-rapidity <lb/>of electrons and muons are required to be within 2.5. Taus <lb/>are reconstructed using Boosted Decision Tree. Calo-jets <lb/>are reconstructed using anti-kt algorithm with R=0.4 (or <lb/>0.6). Missing transverse energy (E miss <lb/>T ) is the opposite di-<lb/>rection of vector sum of calorimeter energy. At CMS, physics <lb/>objects are reconstructed through particle-flow reconstruc-<lb/>tion algorithm which combines all information from all <lb/>sub-detectors and reconstruct all particles. The absolute <lb/>pseudo-rapidity of electrons and muons are required to be <lb/>within 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. Taus are reconstructed us-<lb/>ing Hadron plus strips algorithm. Particle-flow jets are re-<lb/>constructed using anti-kt algorithm with R=0.5. E miss <lb/>T <lb/>is <lb/>the opposite direction of vector sum of reconstructed par-<lb/>ticles. <lb/>3 Cross section measurements <lb/>3.1 Dilepton (ee, eµ, µµ) <lb/>The dilepton decay mode (ee, eµ, µµ) provides clean sig-<lb/>nals by requiring two isolated leptons with two jets and <lb/>E miss <lb/>T <lb/>even though the branching ratio is small. ATLAS <lb/>performed the analysis with the integrated luminosity of <lb/>0.7 fb −1 . The analysis was performed with and without b-<lb/>tagging separately. The invariant mass of dilepton was re-<lb/>quired to be above 15 GeV to remove multi-jet event sam-<lb/>ple which does not describe well low mass region. Z boson <lb/>veto requiring |M ll − M Z | &gt; 15 GeV and E miss <lb/>T <lb/>&gt; 30 GeV to <lb/>remove multi-jet events were applied for ee and µµ decay <lb/>modes. Additionally H T &gt; 130 GeV (or 140 GeV with b-<lb/>tagging) is applied. Lepton efficiencies were obtained with <lb/>Z boson candidates in a data-driven way. The Drell-Yan <lb/>and QCD backgrounds are estimated using Z mass win-<lb/>dow and Matrix method, respectively. The cross section is <lb/>obtained from the profile likelihood fitting. The measured <lb/>cross section without b-tagging is found to be <lb/>σ tt =177±6(stat.)± 17 <lb/>14 (syst.)±8(lumi.) pb <lb/>and with b-tagging <lb/>σ tt =183±6(stat.)± 18 <lb/>14 (syst.)± 8 <lb/>7 (lumi.) pb. <lb/></body>

Distributions of b-tagged jet multiplicity in µµ at CMS <lb/>(left) and in all decay modes at ATLAS (right) after applying final <lb/>selections except b-tagging. <lb/>CMS performed the analysis with the integrated luminos-<lb/>ity of 1.1 fb −1 . The invariant mass of dilepton was required <lb/>to be above 12 GeV. |M ll − M Z | &gt; 15 GeV and E miss <lb/>T <lb/>&gt; 30 <lb/>GeV were required for ee and µµ decay modes. At least <lb/>one b-tagging was applied. Lepton efficiencies, Drell-Yan <lb/>and QCD backgrounds were obtained in a data-driven way <lb/>similar to ATLAS. Distributions of b-tagged jet multiplic-<lb/>ity at CMS and ATLAS are shown in Fig. 1. The cross <lb/>section for each decay mode is obtained using counting <lb/>method and then combined. The combined result of the <lb/>three decay modes is found to be <lb/>σ tt =169.9±3.9(stat.)±16.3(syst.)±7.6(lumi.) pb <lb/>using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method. <lb/>The measured cross sections are consistency with SM NNLO <lb/>prediction. The statistical uncertainty is reduced and the <lb/>systematic uncertainty is now dominant compared to the <lb/>result based on previous data at ATLAS [1]-[2] and CMS [3]-<lb/>[4]. <lb/>3.2 Dilepton (µτ) <lb/>The µ + τ decay mode is interesting decay mode since <lb/>the charged higgs can decay with the same topology when <lb/>the higgs mass is larger than top mass. Any deviation on <lb/>cross section would indicate the new physics. Therefore, <lb/>reducing the systematic uncertainty is crucial in this decay <lb/>mode. ATLAS performed the analysis with an integrated <lb/>luminosity of 0.7 fb −1 . Two tau candidates τ with 1 track <lb/>and τ with more than 1 track are identified using Boosted <lb/>Decision Tree (BDT). QCD events are removed by sub-<lb/>tracting same sign events. Distributions of jet multiplicity <lb/>at ATLAS with BDT &lt; 0.7 and BDT &gt; 0.7 are shown in <lb/>Fig. 2. Even though tau is lepton, this analysis follows lep-<lb/>ton plus jet event selection since hadronic tau decay is con-<lb/>sidered. Measured cross section at ATLAS is <lb/>σ tt =142±21(stat.)± 20 <lb/>16 (syst.)±5(lumi.) pb. <lb/>CMS performed the analysis with an integrated luminosity <lb/>of 1.1 fb −1 data. Tau is identified with Hadrons plus strips <lb/>(HPS) algorithm combining charged hadrons and calorime-<lb/>ter information in strips to take into account π 0 . The fake <lb/>rate from jets is estimated from QCD (gluon jet) and W+jets <lb/>(quark jet) data sample. Measured cross section is <lb/>σ tt =148.7±23.6(stat.)±26.0(syst.)±8.9(lumi.) pb. <lb/>Main systematic uncertainties are from tau fake background <lb/>estimation, identification and b-tagging efficiency. <lb/>Jet Multiplicity <lb/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <lb/>OS -SS Events <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>600 <lb/>700 <lb/>Jet Multiplicity <lb/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <lb/>OS -SS Events <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>600 <lb/>700 <lb/>&lt; 0.7 <lb/>j <lb/>BDT <lb/>ATLAS Preliminary <lb/>-1 <lb/>L dt = 1.08 fb <lb/>∫ <lb/>Data <lb/>b <lb/>+b <lb/>had <lb/>τ <lb/>µ <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>ST, diboson <lb/>Z + jet <lb/>W + jet <lb/>b <lb/>ll+b <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>b <lb/>l+jjb <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>uncertainty <lb/>Jet Multiplicity <lb/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <lb/>OS -SS Events <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>120 <lb/>140 <lb/>Jet Multiplicity <lb/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <lb/>OS -SS Events <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>120 <lb/>140 <lb/>&gt; 0.7 <lb/>j <lb/>BDT <lb/>ATLAS Preliminary <lb/>-1 <lb/>L dt = 1.08 fb <lb/>∫ <lb/>Data <lb/>b <lb/>+b <lb/>had <lb/>τ <lb/>µ <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>ST, diboson <lb/>Z + jet <lb/>W + jet <lb/>b <lb/>ll+b <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>b <lb/>l+jjb <lb/>→ <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>uncertainty <lb/>Fig. 2.

(a) BDT &lt; 0.7, (b) BDT &gt; 0.7 <lb/>3.3 Lepton+jets <lb/>In lepton+jet decay mode (e, µ), the signature of a final <lb/>state is one exclusive lepton, 4 jets and E miss <lb/>T . ATLAS per-<lb/>formed the analysis with the integrated luminosity of 0.7 <lb/>fb −1 at ATLAS. Exclusively one isolated muon with p T &gt; <lb/>20 GeV or electron with p T &gt; 25 GeV is required to re-<lb/>move Z boson background. E miss <lb/>T <lb/>is required to be larger <lb/>than 35 and 25 GeV for e and µ, respectively. M W <lb/>T (Trans-<lb/>verse mass of W boson) was applied for electron channel <lb/>and the sum of M W <lb/>T and E miss <lb/>T <lb/>should be larger than 60 GeV <lb/>for muon channel to remove further multi-jet QCD contri-<lb/>bution. The QCD shapes are obtained from data directly <lb/>using Matrix method in ATLAS. The binned profile likeli-<lb/>hood fitting was also used fitting to likelihood discriminant <lb/>which is as a function of lepton η, highest jet p T , event <lb/>aplanarity and H T . The result of the fit is shown in Fig. 3. <lb/>Main systematic uncertainties are from signal MC genera-<lb/>tor, JES, and ISR, FSR. Measured cross section is found to <lb/>be <lb/>σ tt =179.0±3.9(stat.)±9.0(syst.)±6.6(lumi.) pb. <lb/>CMS performed the analysis with the integrated luminos-<lb/>ity of 1.1 fb −1 . Exclusively one isolated muon with p T &gt; <lb/>35 GeV or electron p T &gt; 45 GeV is required to remove Z <lb/>boson background. E miss <lb/>T <lb/>is required to be larger than 20 <lb/>and 30 GeV for e and µ, respectively. b-tagging with sec-<lb/>ondary vertex algorithm was applied at CMS. The QCD <lb/>shapes are obtained from data directly using non-isolated <lb/>data. Binned profile likelihood fitting was used fitting to <lb/>secondary vertex mass distribution in 1 b-tag and 2 b-tag <lb/>jet bins. Measured cross section is found to be <lb/>σ tt =164.4±2.8(stat.)±11.9(syst.)±7.4(lumi.) pb. <lb/>Main systematic uncertainties are from W+jets Q 2 scale, <lb/>b-tagging efficiency and jet energy scale (JES). Compar-<lb/>ing the result with 36 pb −1 in 2010 [5]-[6], the statistical <lb/>uncertainty was by far reduced and the systematic uncer-<lb/>tainty is dominant. <lb/>3.4 Hadronic decay <lb/>In hadronic decay mode, The branching ratio of hadronic <lb/>decay mode is as large as around 45 %. However, it suffers <lb/>from large multi-jet background. In this analysis, 6 jets are <lb/>required. At least two b-tagged jets are also required.

The combined result was found <lb/>to be <lb/>σ tt =176±5(stat.)± 13 <lb/>10 (syst.)±7(lumi.) pb. <lb/>At the time of HCP2011, CMS combined the dilepton (ee, <lb/>eµ, µµ, µτ), lepton+jets (e, µ) and all hadronic decay anal-<lb/>ysis performed with around 1 fb −1 . The binned maximum <lb/>likelihood fitter from lepton+jet analysis was used for com-<lb/>bination adding other decay modes as a single bin. The cor-<lb/>relations of the systematic uncertainties between different <lb/>decay modes are taken into account in the fit. Combined <lb/>cross section result at CMS comparing to the approximate <lb/>NNLO calculations are shown in Fig. 5. The combined re-<lb/>sult is found to be <lb/>σ tt =165.8±2.2(stat.)±10.6(syst.)±7.8(lumi.) pb. <lb/>The overall total uncertainty in combined analysis at CMS <lb/>only is obtained to be 8%, which is the most precise mea-<lb/>surement at the LHC. <lb/>4 Jet multiplicity <lb/>Jet multiplicity distribution of tt with additional jets and as <lb/>a function of the jet transverse momentum is very useful to <lb/>constrain ISR. The analysis was performed in lepton+jets <lb/>channel with a luminosity of 0.7 fb −1 at ATLAS. Event se-<lb/>lection follows lepton+jet analysis with requiring at least <lb/>4 jets and one b-tagging. The background-subtracted re-<lb/>constructed jet multiplicity as a function of jet p T thresh-<lb/>old (25, 40 and 60 GeV) is compared with ISR variations <lb/>for electron and muon decay modes. The reconstructed-jet <lb/>multiplicity for final states with one selected electron for <lb/>jet p T 25 GeV and 40 GeV and with one selected muon for <lb/>jet p T 60 GeV are shown in Figs 6. The ISR variations were <lb/>generated by varying the settings of the PYTHIA genera-<lb/>tor. There was no deviation found from MC@NLO SM <lb/>model prediction. We need more statistics to constrain ISR. <lb/></body>

CDF has observed 3.4 sigma deviation with re-<lb/>spect to SM above 450 GeV. The deviation could be ex-<lb/>plained by possible new exchange particles in t-channel <lb/>from various theory. The charge asymmetry variable is sen-<lb/>sitive to this additional production mode. Unlike Tevatron, <lb/>it is hard to measure in pp collision due to the symmet-<lb/>ric initial state of pp collisions at the LHC. Therefore, the <lb/>rapidity distributions of top and anti-top quarks are sym-<lb/>metrically distributed around zero. However, it is feasi-<lb/>ble when we consider top quark (valence quark) width is <lb/>broader than anti-top quark (see quark) width. At ATLAS, <lb/>absolute rapidity was used. Event selection follows lep-<lb/>ton+jets analysis requiring 4 jets and one b-tagging. Regu-<lb/>larized unfolding method was applied. The combined charge <lb/>asymmetry is measured to be consistent with the SM pre-<lb/>diction. The charged asymmetry variables at CMS are ab-<lb/>solute pseudo-rapidity ∆(|η|) = |η t | − |ηt| and rapidity with <lb/>boosted effect ∆(y 2 ) = (y t − yt) × (y t + yt).
