			<body>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>The COVID-19 pandemic affects people across the world. While the <lb/>virus appears to infect people of all ages and health status, those with <lb/>cancer, may be at higher risk for developing critical illness and death <lb/>(1,2). Besides physical implications, the psychosocial burden that the <lb/>pandemic puts on people may be especially high for those whose lives <lb/>have already been affected by cancer. Although people confronted <lb/>with cancer can be surprisingly resilient, half of cancer patients suffer <lb/>from significant psychological distress (3). Almost one-third of patients <lb/>develop a psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety and depression (4). <lb/>Family members, in particular life partners of cancer patients, also <lb/>experience psychological problems due to the cancer (5). The addi-<lb/>tional worries caused by COVID-19 and the social distancing regula-<lb/>tions can be detrimental for their wellbeing. To address their needs, <lb/>we explored experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic in patients or <lb/>family members who sought help at a mental health care institute for <lb/>psycho-oncology. Note that family members sought help for them-<lb/>selves, sometimes independently from the cancer patient. <lb/>2 | SETTING AND SURVEY <lb/>On March 12, the Netherlands went into lockdown. At the Helen <lb/>Dowling Institute, a mental health care institute specialized in psycho-<lb/>oncology care, psychological care was continued via video-consults <lb/>and online therapy. Seven weeks after the lockdown, clients (out-<lb/>patients and family members) were invited to participate in a survey <lb/>on the psychosocial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study <lb/>was approved by the ethical board of the Helen Dowling Institute. Of <lb/>the 871 invited clients, 274 clients (233 patients and 41 family mem-<lb/>bers) responded within 2 weeks. Clients were mainly diagnosed with <lb/>an anxiety disorder (including post-traumatic stress), somatic symptom <lb/>disorder or depressive disorder (see Table 1 for demographic <lb/>characteristics). <lb/>The 12-item survey included questions regarding loneliness, <lb/>fear of infection and dying from COVID-19. For example: &quot;I worry <lb/>about getting infected with the coronavirus&quot;. Answers ranged from <lb/>0 = &apos;do not agree al all&apos; to 5 = &apos;totally agree&apos;. Scores ≥4 were coun-<lb/>ted as positive. The last question was open-ended: &quot;What impact <lb/></body>

			<body>does the coronacrisis have on your life? Please describe in a few <lb/>sentences how your live has been changed.&quot; Using the thematic <lb/>analysis approach, the first author (in discussion with the second <lb/>author) coded the open-ended answers and grouped the codes into <lb/>the following themes: fear and loneliness, feelings of peace and <lb/>belonging. <lb/>3 | FEAR AND LONELINESS <lb/>The pandemic adds uncertainty for many patients, leading to addi-<lb/>tional worries. Their fears mainly concerned getting infected with <lb/>COVID-19 (50.5%) and requiring treatment on the intensive care unit <lb/>(58.0%). Many patients worried about being alone in the hospital <lb/>(45.6%) and not being able to say farewell to family and friends in case <lb/>of dying from COVID-19 (44.5%). Family members are mainly worried <lb/>about infecting the patient (65.9%). <lb/>Next to fear, loneliness appeared to be a main concern of many <lb/>clients: 36.3% of patients and 41.4% of family members reported feel-<lb/>ing lonelier than before the pandemic. Many patients described how <lb/>isolated they now feel. They miss contact with family and friends, <lb/>which cannot be replaced by a phone call. <lb/>Female patient (≥70): &quot;As someone of age who lives alone with can-<lb/>cer this is a very lonely process. I usually get by very well all by myself. <lb/>But now that all activities outside my home have been cancelled, this is <lb/>very difficult. My skin craves to be touched. No hugs…&quot;. <lb/>These feelings of loneliness seemed to fuel their worries regard-<lb/>ing the cancer. Social outings offered a welcome distraction, leading <lb/>their thoughts away from cancer. With that gone, their life is <lb/>completely focused on cancer again. <lb/>Male partner (50-59): &quot;Being in isolation with my partner who has <lb/>cancer, I miss those moments of recharging by going out with my friends <lb/>and being able to put the cancer on pause. Life is continuously focused on <lb/>only one thing: cancer. How do we keep going? There is no football <lb/>match, no festival, no street fair to get your mind of things. Life has <lb/>become empty. Even the contact with the physician is very limited. There <lb/>is not much left to be happy about.&quot; <lb/>4 | ON THE POSITIVE SIDE: FEELINGS OF <lb/>PEACE AND BELONGING <lb/>For those who have their whole family at home during the lockdown, it <lb/>was busy, often creating extra tension. However, a large group of <lb/>patients (45.5%) and family members (41.5%) felt more at ease because <lb/>of the lockdown. The overload of the external stimuli of daily life had <lb/>fallen away. This created a sense of peace and seems to ease their <lb/>worries. <lb/>The lockdown offered people time to reflect positively on their <lb/>lives: 39.8% of patients and 36.6% of family members expressed they <lb/>were now able to focus more on things that are really important <lb/>to them. <lb/>Female patient (50-59): &quot;This situation has thrown me back onto <lb/>myself instead of reaching out to others. Surprisingly, this stimulated my <lb/>self-reliance which suits me well. I am more in contact with what is truly <lb/>important/valuable to me. Of course I am bored at times, or think it sucks <lb/>that contact with others is so limited. But in the end I feel good, less of a <lb/>victim.&quot; <lb/>Several patients described how they were already used to staying <lb/>at home. Now that everyone stays indoors, they do not feel left out <lb/>anymore, which reinstates a sense of belonging. <lb/>Female patient (50-59): &quot;Currently, also all of my colleagues are <lb/>working from home. Now I am not the only one anymore who dials in (per <lb/>phone/video) at meetings, and I see that as an advantage.&quot; <lb/>5 | IMPLICATIONS <lb/>For many clients, who already suffered from mental problems due to <lb/>cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic caused additional fears The loneli-<lb/>ness they feel because of the lockdown regulations, seems to increase <lb/>their worries. For others, the pandemic created a sense of peace. It <lb/>gave them time to reflect on things that are truly important to them. <lb/>Moreover, they felt being part of society again, as everyone has to <lb/>stay home and limit their social contacts. <lb/>T A B L E 1 Demographic characteristics of the 274 survey <lb/>respondents <lb/>233 patients <lb/>n (%) <lb/>41 family <lb/>members n (%) <lb/>Sex, female <lb/>172 (73.8) <lb/>28 (68.3) <lb/>Age <lb/>&lt; 30 <lb/>8 (3.4) <lb/>1 (2.4) <lb/>30-39 <lb/>25 (10.7) <lb/>8 (19.5) <lb/>40-49 <lb/>40 (17.2) <lb/>8 (19.5) <lb/>50-59 <lb/>77 (33.0) <lb/>12 (29.3) <lb/>60-69 <lb/>62 (26.6) <lb/>10 (24.4) <lb/>≥ 70 <lb/>21 (9.0) <lb/>2 (4.9) <lb/>Living situation <lb/>Alone <lb/>45 (19.3) <lb/>11 (26.8) <lb/>With partner <lb/>76 (32.6) <lb/>11 (26.8) <lb/>With partner and children <lb/>98 (42.1) <lb/>14 (34.1) <lb/>With children <lb/>12 (5.2) <lb/>4 (9.8) <lb/>With parents <lb/>1 (0.4) <lb/>1 (2.4) <lb/>Education <lb/>Primary/lower secondary <lb/>12 (5.2) <lb/>3 (7.3) <lb/>Upper secondary <lb/>90 (39.1) <lb/>12 (29.3) <lb/>Higher vocational training/university 124 (53.3) <lb/>25 (61.0) <lb/>Start psychological treatment <lb/>Prior 2019 <lb/>52 (22.3) <lb/>15 (36.6) <lb/>Since 2019 <lb/>94 (40.3) <lb/>15 (36.6) <lb/>Since 2020 <lb/>87 (37.3) <lb/>11 (26.8) <lb/></body>

			<body>These positive experiences can provide input for helping patients <lb/>and family members to cultivate resilience. For example, therapists <lb/>can help clients to explore what values are important to them and <lb/>how they can live by these values, also in case their activities are lim-<lb/>ited due to cancer and lockdown. Acceptance and commitment ther-<lb/>apy includes exercises for living a meaningful life, that can inspire <lb/>therapists and clients (6). The sense of peace and belonging that peo-<lb/>ple felt, may be maintained if the stories of these patients become <lb/>known to the general public. Remembering the restrictions of isolation <lb/>and knowing that cancer patients and family members are living unre-<lb/>mittingly this way, increases understanding, which might mitigate the <lb/>feeling of being left-out. <lb/>To be prepared for a future lockdown, it may be helpful to urge <lb/>clients to seek safe forms of social contact. For example, people liv-<lb/>ing alone could choose one or two friends or family members that <lb/>they keep in (physical) contact with, with the precaution that these <lb/>contacts isolate themselves apart from the contact with the patient. <lb/>Also (online) contact with people in the same boat, that does not <lb/>focus on cancer, but rather on the consoling things in life, might be <lb/>helpful. <lb/>These findings might facilitate communication between clients <lb/>and health care professionals. When fear and feelings of loneliness <lb/>are addressed and normalized, it often relieves accompanying distress. <lb/>Importantly, addressing these feelings might also help to take the step <lb/>to seek psychological care if needed. <lb/></body>
