The spread of events has been extensively studied such <lb/>that the systems exhibit catastrophic chain reactions if the interaction represented by the ratio of <lb/>reproduction exceeds unity; however, their subthreshold states are not fully understood. Here, we <lb/>report that these systems are possessed by nonstationary cascades of event-occurrences already in the <lb/>subthreshold regime. Event cascades can be harmful in some contexts, when the peak-demand causes <lb/>vaccine shortages, heavy traffic on communication lines, but may be beneficial in other contexts, such <lb/>that spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to generate motion or store memory. Thus <lb/>it is important to comprehend the mechanism by which such cascades appear, and consider controlling <lb/>a system to tame or facilitate fluctuations in the event-occurrences. The critical interaction for the <lb/>emergence of cascades depends greatly on the network structure in which individuals are connected. <lb/>We demonstrate that we can predict whether cascades may emerge, given information about the <lb/>interactions between individuals. Furthermore, we develop a method of reallocating connections <lb/>among individuals so that event cascades may be either impeded or impelled in a network. <lb/></front>

			<body>Our life is full of cause-and-effect relationships, such that past events influence the future occurrence of events. <lb/>The proliferation process has been studied using both macroscopic models, such as the epidemic model 1 , and <lb/>microscopic models, such as the self-exciting point process proposed by Hawkes 2,3 . These models have been <lb/>applied to analyze not only the communication of diseases 4-8 but also urban crime 9 , human activity 10-14 , econom-<lb/>ics 15 , genome sequences 16 , and neuronal firing 17,18 . A key quantity representing the interaction in these various <lb/>phenomena is the basic reproduction ratio, which is defined as the average number of additional events induced <lb/>by a single event 19 . In epidemics, a disease becomes a pandemic in a homogeneous network if the reproduction <lb/>ratio is greater than unity, as in a nuclear chain reaction 20-22 , and vanishes otherwise. <lb/>Nevertheless, the event-occurrence does not cease if individuals are stimulated in external communities or <lb/>exhibit spontaneous activity. In such situations, the system may still exhibit cascades of event-occurrences inter-<lb/>mittently, even if the reproduction ratio is smaller than the epidemic threshold, as in tweets 11,23,24 and neuronal <lb/>firings in vivo 25 . The nonstationary fluctuations may be terminated by reducing the reproduction ratio further 26 . <lb/>Event cascades can be a nuisance in some contexts, such as when the peak-demand causes vaccine shortages 27,28 <lb/>or heavy traffic on communication lines 29 , but may be beneficial in other contexts; for example, spontaneous <lb/>activity in neural networks may be used to generate motion or store memory 30-32 . Thus, it is important to com-<lb/>prehend the mechanism by which such cascades appear. We show that such a transition between stationary and <lb/>nonstationary states generally occurs in every proliferation system, obtain the condition on which cascades may <lb/>emerge in a given network, and suggest a systematic method for controlling systems to oppress or promote the <lb/>event-occurrence bursts. <lb/>Results <lb/>Mean rate of event-occurrence. Although the epidemic model and the Hawkes process appear to differ <lb/>from one another, they have something in common because both were constructed to describe the proliferation <lb/>processes. To identify their common features, we first revise them by considering realistic constraints. <lb/>For an epidemic model, we consider the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model describing the situation <lb/>in which infected individuals may recover without immunity: <lb/>β <lb/>γ <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>di dt <lb/>si <lb/>i <lb/>/ <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/></body>

			<body>where i and s are the fractions of infected and susceptible individuals, respectively (i + s = 1); β is the rate at which <lb/>susceptible individuals are infected by contacting infected individuals; and γ is the rate at which infected individ-<lb/>uals recover and regain susceptibility. The infected individuals asymptotically vanish if the reproduction ratio <lb/>R 0 = β/γ is smaller than or equal to unity; otherwise, the fraction is finite: ≡ <lb/>= − <lb/>∞ <lb/>→ ∞ <lb/>i <lb/>i t <lb/>R <lb/>lim <lb/>( ) 1 1/ <lb/>t <lb/>0 . To con-<lb/>sider extrinsic or spontaneous activation, we suggest revising the SIS model by adding an inflow to the infected <lb/>population from the susceptible one: <lb/>β <lb/>γ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= <lb/>− + . <lb/>di dt <lb/>si <lb/>i <lb/>s <lb/>/ <lb/>(2) <lb/>In the presence of spontaneous activity ρ(&gt;0), the asymptotic fraction of infected individuals remains positive <lb/>and smoothly increases with R 0 , and, accordingly, the epidemic transition at R 0 = is softened (Fig. 1a). <lb/>The Hawkes process considers spontaneous occurrences in terms of the positive base rate ρ and describes the <lb/>manner in which the event-occurrence rate λ(t) is modulated by past events: <lb/>∑ <lb/>λ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= + <lb/>− <lb/>t <lb/>R <lb/>h t t <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>), <lb/>(3) <lb/>k <lb/>k <lb/>0 <lb/>where t k is the occurrence time of the kth event. The history kernel h(t) satisfies the causality, h(t) = 0 for t &lt; 0, and <lb/>the normalization, ∫ <lb/>= <lb/>∞ h t dt <lb/>( ) <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>. By taking the ensemble average, the average rate of event-occurrence is <lb/>obtained as 〈λ(t)〉 = ρ/(1 − R 0 ). The divergence at R 0 = 1 arises from instantaneous reactivation, which is an arti-<lb/>fact caused by the simplicity of the linear model, which ignores the refractory period during which each individ-<lb/>ual does not recover susceptibility. Here, we suggest revising the model by introducing the effect of a refractory <lb/>period 1/γ: <lb/>∑ <lb/>λ <lb/>λ <lb/>γ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>− <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>. <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>R <lb/>h t t <lb/>( ) <lb/>1 <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>(4) <lb/>k <lb/>k <lb/>0 <lb/>By taking an ensemble average and approximating 〈λ 2 〉 with 〈λ〉 2 , we obtain the average rate of event-occurrences <lb/>as 〈λ〉 = γi ∞ , where i ∞ is the asymptotic fraction obtained for the revised SIS model (Fig. 1b). Thus, the epidemic <lb/>model and the Hawkes process may represent the identical mean occurrence rate by taking the spontaneous acti-<lb/>vation and the refractory periods into account. <lb/>Fluctuations in the event-occurrence. Although the systems no longer exhibit a clear transition at R 0 = 1 <lb/>causing the catastrophic chain reaction, they may still show nonstationary fluctuations with intermittent cascades <lb/>of event-occurrences at lower reproduction ratios; when the reproduction ratio is even smaller, they may remain <lb/>stationary, producing apparently random events over time. <lb/>The SIS model that addresses the mean population dynamics cannot represent fluctuations in the <lb/>event-occurrences. Here, we construct and simulate a Markov process of microscopic dynamics in which indi-<lb/>viduals become infected and recover to be susceptible (Fig. 2a). In every interval of a small time-step δt, each <lb/>susceptible individual in total population of size N may become infected with a probability (βi + ρ)δt, which <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>shifts as i → i + 1/N. Each infected individual may regain their susceptibility with the probability γδt, which shifts <lb/>as i → i − 1/N. Figure 2b depicts sample sequences of infected times: At a reproduction ratio of R 0 = β/γ = 0.2, <lb/>the occurrence of infection appears random across individuals but stationary in the whole system. By contrast, <lb/>at R 0 = 0.6 or 0.8, the event sequence appears nonstationary, exhibiting spontaneous cascades of occurrences. <lb/>Indeed, microscopic fluctuations are amplified to be macroscopically visible, whereas the average rate is restrained <lb/>to be finite. <lb/>We suggest deciding whether a given series of events is stationary or nonstationary based on whether proper <lb/>rate estimators conclude a constant rate or a fluctuating rate, respectively. Here, we adopt a method of selecting <lb/>the histogram bin size to minimize the expected mean square error between the histogram and the unknown <lb/>underlying rate . Note that the decision regarding stationary vs nonstationary state is common across proper rate <lb/>estimators, such as the Empirical Bayes and variational Bayes Hidden Markov estimators 34 . <lb/>Histograms were fitted to the data: The optimal bin size Δ * was diverging (becoming as large as the entire <lb/>observation period) when R 0 = 0.2, whereas it was finite (significantly smaller than the entire period) when <lb/>R 0 = 0.6 and 0.8. Figure 2c depicts the manner in which the inverse bin size 1/Δ * varies with the reproduction <lb/>ratio R 0 . 1/Δ * remains near zero if R 0 is smaller than approximately 0.3, and it departs from zero otherwise, thus <lb/>exhibiting the stationary-nonstationary (SN) transition. <lb/>We also simulated the revised Hawkes process (4) with parameters identical to those used for the epidemic <lb/>Markov process. Here, events are indicated by repeating the Bernoulli trials with a probability of λ(t)δt in every <lb/>small interval of δt. By plotting 1/Δ * versus R 0 , we can also observe the transition (Fig. 2c). Figure 2d depicts the <lb/>critical reproduction ratios obtained for the epidemic Markov process and the revised Hawkes process plotted <lb/>against the refractory period 1/γ, indicating that the SN critical points for both models are robustly close to <lb/>− <lb/>≈ . <lb/>1 1/ 2 <lb/>0 3, which was obtained for the original (linear) Hawkes process (1/γ = 0) in our previous study 26 . <lb/>Note that the critical point is independent of the shape of the kernel, as well as the base rate. <lb/>Event-occurrences in inhomogeneous networks. Finally, we consider the emergence of cascades in a <lb/>population of individuals interacting through inhomogeneous connections. <lb/>To obtain the condition for the SN transition analytically, we analyze the linear multivariate Hawkes processes <lb/>(Fig. 3a). The rate of event-occurrences in the ith individual or node (i = 1, 2, •••, N) is given as <lb/>∑ ∑ <lb/>λ <lb/>ρ <lb/>α <lb/>= + <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>t <lb/>h t t <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>), <lb/>(5) <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>N <lb/>ij <lb/>k <lb/>j <lb/>k <lb/>1 <lb/>where ρ i represents the base rate, t j <lb/>k is the occurrence time of the kth event in the jth node, and α ij represents the <lb/>interaction from the jth node to the ith node. Because of the interactions between individuals, A ≡ {α ij }, the aver-<lb/>age rates 〈λ〉 = {〈λ i 〉} are shifted from the base rates ρ = {ρ i } as 〈λ〉 = Lρ, where L is the Leontief inverse 35 : <lb/>≡ ∑ <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>∞ <lb/>L <lb/>A <lb/>I I A <lb/>/( <lb/>) <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>0 <lb/>. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>Even when the fluctuations are not detectable at any single node, all events occurring in the entire set of nodes <lb/>may exhibit visible fluctuations because the signal-to-noise ratio may increase when multiple series of events are <lb/>superposed (Fig. 3b). By analyzing equation (5), we obtain the condition for a series of events occurring in an <lb/>entire population to be nonstationary, or cascading (see Methods): <lb/>λ <lb/>Λ <lb/>≡ <lb/>∑ <lb/>∑ <lb/>&gt; <lb/>L L <lb/>C <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>2, <lb/>(6) <lb/>i j <lb/>T <lb/>ij <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>, <lb/>where Λ ≡ diag(〈λ〉). <lb/>Here, we consider 0-1 connectivity with strength α ij = 0 or R 0 /Nc, where c is the fraction of connections. For <lb/>a fully connected uniform network (c = 1), the summed rate λ <lb/>λ <lb/>= ∑ = <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>i <lb/>N <lb/>i <lb/>1 <lb/>obeys the original Hawkes process <lb/>equation (3) with ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= ∑ = <lb/>i <lb/>N <lb/>i <lb/>1 , thus the entire system may exhibit the SN transition at = − <lb/>≈ . <lb/>R 1 1/ 2 <lb/>0 3 <lb/>c <lb/>. For <lb/>sparsely connected networks in which every pair of nodes is randomly linked at a fraction of c, the SN critical <lb/>point R c remains near 0.3. <lb/>Nevertheless, it is possible to shift the cascading condition C by reallocating the connections between indi-<lb/>viduals by conserving the fraction of connections c; exchanging connections α ij and α i′j′ may alter the cascading <lb/>condition C by <lb/> <lb/>α <lb/>α <lb/>λ <lb/>∆ = − <lb/>− <lb/>∑ <lb/>+ <lb/>′ ′ <lb/>′ ′ <lb/>C <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>R N <lb/>( / ) , <lb/>(7) <lb/>ij ij <lb/>i j <lb/>i j <lb/>k <lb/>k <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>where H ij ≡ ((∑ k L ki ) 2 − C)ρ j + 2(∑ k L kj )〈λ j 〉. To raise or lower C, we repeat exchanging a pair of connections that <lb/>maximizes or minimizes ΔC (Fig. 4a). <lb/>A network may change the state from stationary to nonstationary if the cascading condition C steps across <lb/>the critical value of 2 from below or vice versa by reconnecting individuals. Figure 4b demonstrates the manner <lb/>in which C is altered by the steepest ascent or descent based on equation (7). When (R 0 , c) = (0.1, 0.1), C remains <lb/>below 2, even when all connections are reallocated; however, when (R 0 , c) = (0.35, 0.1), C exceeds 2, indicating <lb/>that the system may change between nonstationary (C &gt; 2) and stationary (C ≤ 2). <lb/>In the study of epidemics, whether the epidemic threshold is higher in the clustered networks 8,36,37 or not 38 <lb/>has been controversial. Here, we are not addressing the epidemic transition, but we are interested in how the <lb/>clustering of individuals influences the SN transition. Figure 4c depicts the manner in which the average cluster-<lb/>ing coefficient changes with our gradient ascent or descent of C, indicating that clustering tends to facilitate the <lb/>event-occurrence cascades. A similar tendency was reported in neural network simulations 32 . An advantage of <lb/>our method is that we can control the cascade bursting activity by systematically rearranging connections based <lb/>on a single measure: C. <lb/>Figure 4d depicts the range of (R , c) in which a network of a large size N may exhibit stationary and nonsta-<lb/>tionary states. In the &quot;Stationary&quot; regime, the systems never generate visible cascades, even when connections are <lb/>reallocated, whereas in the &quot;Nonstationary&quot; regime, the systems always exhibit cascades. In the &quot;S-N 0&quot; regime, <lb/>networks may be either stationary or nonstationary, depending on the manner in which individuals are con-<lb/>nected. In the &quot;S-N 1&quot; regime, networks may be either stationary or nonstationary if the reciprocal connections <lb/>b <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>j′ <lb/>α ij <lb/>α ij&apos; <lb/>a <lb/>{t k <lb/>j } <lb/>{t k <lb/>j&apos; } <lb/>λ i (t) <lb/>{t k <lb/>i } <lb/>λ i (t) <lb/>t <lb/>α ij <lb/>t <lb/>δt <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>... <lb/>= <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>can be controlled independently, whereas undirected networks, whose connections are reciprocally symmetric <lb/>{α ij = α ji }, remain nonstationary, always generating cascades of events. For undirected networks, the critical point <lb/>R c appears to be bounded at approximately 0.3. <lb/>As extreme configurations with low critical points, we considered networks of (i): the nodes of one group are <lb/>fully connected within the group, and the others are isolated; and (ii): the nodes of one group are fully connected <lb/>within the group and also receive undirected (reciprocal) connections from all nodes of another group. The criti-<lb/>cal points R c exhibit crossover at c = 0.20, and above and below this point, those of (i) and (ii) are lower. The crit-<lb/>icality in low R 0 implies that these configurations tend to facilitate cascade bursting. As an opposite extreme, we <lb/>considered another configuration (iii): each node of one group receives only directed connections from another <lb/>group. We also considered a specific hierarchical networks of (iv): every node exerts the influence over the lower <lb/>hierarchy nodes in a manner that connections form a triangular matrix. All critical points for these specific <lb/>cases are obtained analytically (see Methods) and plotted in Fig. 4d: The configurations (i) and (ii) tend to incite <lb/>bursting, whereas the configurations (iii) and (iv) impede bursting. These observations imply that networks in <lb/>which small number of individuals occupy reciprocal connections favor event cascade bursting, whereas directed <lb/>unilateral connections tend to impede cascades. <lb/>Any network exhibits the SN transition within the range of S-N 0 or S-N 1 on a plane of (R 0 , c), independently <lb/>of the system size N (Fig. 4d). The precise transition point within the transition range is determined by the net-<lb/>work configuration A ≡ {α ij }. Here we examine the SN transition in representative network models, such as the <lb/>scale-free network (Barabási-Albert model) 39 , the random network (Erdös-Rényi model) 40 , and the small-world <lb/>network (Watts-Strogatz model) 41 assuming reciprocal connections. In particular, we compare the SN critical <lb/>points R c of those networks of identical number of nodes N and the fraction of connections inversely proportional <lb/>to the number of nodes c = 6/N (Fig. 5). The scale-free network is assembled with the Barabási-Albert model. The <lb/>small-world network is made by rewiring a regular ring lattice with the rewiring probability p = 0.1. The critical <lb/>point R c in the scale-free network is the lowest among those networks, implying that the wide disparity in degrees <lb/>(numbers of connections) of individual nodes may facilitate the fluctuations in event occurrences. By obtaining <lb/>the average critical point analytically, we may confirm that R c → 0 as N → ∞ (see Methods). It is interesting to see <lb/>that R c is higher in the small-world network than in the Erdös-Rényi model. This may also be closely related to the <lb/>difference in degrees; the small-world network of the small rewiring probability exhibits the smaller degree dis-<lb/>persion than the Erdös-Rényi model. Indeed, a regular ring lattice in which individual degrees are identical gives <lb/>the highest critical point R c = 0.2929, which is equal to the critical point of a fully connected uniform network, <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>− <lb/>1 1/ 2 . In this way, the SN transition points R c can be different, crucially depending on the network structure, <lb/>in particular on the degree dispersion. <lb/>Finally we demonstrate the manner in which the network is reconnected by our method for inciting or imped-<lb/>ing cascades (Fig. 6); we take up the network of &quot;Zachary&apos;s Karate Club&quot; 42 and reallocate the (undirected) friend-<lb/>ships between 34 people. By assuming that the original network is at the criticality C = 2, we reorganized the <lb/>network so that their entire communication becomes stationary or nonstationary. The operation to impede the <lb/>communication cascades (ΔC &lt; 0) tended to make all people be connected harmoniously. Contrariwise, the <lb/>operation to incite the cascade (ΔC &gt; 0) made the society polarized into two kinds of people; a few people have <lb/>exclusive rich connections, while others are connected only with those people. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Here, we showed that the proliferation process may exhibit the SN transition at which nonstationary cascades <lb/>of event-occurrences emerge from the stationary process. The critical reproduction ratio for the SN transition <lb/>R c is much smaller than the threshold for the conventional epidemic transition exhibiting chain reactions. The <lb/>SN transition may depend greatly on the manner in which individuals are connected. We developed a theory <lb/>for predicting the occurrence of cascades in a network. We also suggested a method of reconnecting individuals <lb/>for impeding or inciting cascade bursting in a network. It was revealed that networks of reciprocal connections <lb/>exhibiting wide disparity in degrees of individual nodes are apt to trigger the event cascades. <lb/>Note that the term &quot;cascade&quot; has also been used differently in other contexts, as expressing transient phe-<lb/>nomena of event spreads, as in failures in a power grid, chain bankruptcies, and information cascades in social <lb/>systems 43-45 . Though their basic process is similar to that of our SN transition, the situations are different; we <lb/>considered here the fluctuations in the process of event occurrences that involves constant spontaneous activity <lb/>or external activation such that individuals are continually generating events at a finite probability. <lb/>In this study, we revealed that nonstationary fluctuations may occur autonomously in a static network without <lb/>environmental fluctuations. In real-world circumstances, however, both connections and environmental inputs <lb/>may change in time, and the event cascades may have been induced by such extrinsic cause. Thus it may be an <lb/>important direction in future to consider discerning the factor that may have contributed to the observed fluctu-<lb/>ations, namely, whether the fluctuations were originated intrinsically or extrinsically. <lb/>To set about applying our theory to real-world problems, we should also consider adapting models to indi-<lb/>vidual situations, by collecting information regarding interactions among individuals. Interactions in epidemic <lb/>networks may be inferred by getting hold of information of contacts between individuals and estimating the <lb/>infectivity of the disease. Interactions in neural networks may be estimated by detecting the synaptic connections <lb/>and measuring the strength of connections such as excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. If the infor-<lb/>mation of interactions is given, we can predict whether the network may exhibit nonstationary fluctuations, using <lb/>the theory developed here. However, it is practically difficult to obtain the entire information of the interactions <lb/>among all pairs of existing nodes. Thus it is useful to devise a method of complementing information of the entire <lb/>network from partial observation, and furthermore, to suggest controlling systems by manipulating partially <lb/>available links. <lb/>Figure 5.

			<body>Methods <lb/>Derivation of the condition for the SN transition. Here, we derive the condition for the SN transition <lb/>for a given series of events. It has been proven that the optimal bin size may be finite if fluctuation in the underly-<lb/>ing rate δλ(t) ≡ λ(t) − 〈λ〉 satisfies the condition 34,46 <lb/>∫ <lb/>λ <lb/>δλ <lb/>δλ <lb/>+ <lb/>&gt; <lb/>−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>t s <lb/>t ds <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>) ( ) <lb/>1, <lb/>(8) <lb/>and diverges otherwise. This condition (8) is derived as follows. The mean square error between the underlying <lb/>rate λ(t) and the histogram λ t <lb/>( ) is given as <lb/>∫ λ <lb/>λ <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>→∞Ŝ <lb/>T <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>dt <lb/>lim <lb/>1 <lb/>( ( ) <lb/>( )) <lb/>, <lb/>(9) <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>0 <lb/>where T is the entire observation interval, and the bracket represents the ensemble average over the possible real-<lb/>ization of the stochastic process. In each bin of size Δ, the histogram λ t <lb/>( ) is a constant whose height is the number <lb/>of events K divided by the bin size Δ. Thus, the mean square error is transformed as <lb/>∫ λ <lb/>λ <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>− <lb/>∆ <lb/>+ <lb/>∆ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>. <lb/>∆ <lb/>S <lb/>t <lb/>K t <lb/>K dt <lb/>1 <lb/>( ) <lb/>2 <lb/>( ) <lb/>(10) <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>The expected number of events in each interval is given by integrating the underlying rate: <lb/>∫ λ <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/>K <lb/>tdt <lb/>( ) <lb/>0 <lb/>. <lb/>Because events are independently drawn, the Poisson relation holds: 〈K 2 〉 = 〈K〉 2 + 〈K〉. Inserting these relations <lb/>into equation (10), we have <lb/>∫ ∫ <lb/>φ <lb/>λ <lb/>φ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>∆ <lb/>− <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>− <lb/>S <lb/>d t <lb/>sds <lb/>(0) <lb/>1 <lb/>( ) , <lb/>(11) <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>0 <lb/>where φ(s) ≡ 〈λ(t + s)λ(t)〉 − 〈λ〉 2 is the correlation of the rate fluctuation or φ(s) = 〈δλ(t + s)δλ(t)〉, where <lb/>δλ(t) ≡ λ(t) − 〈λ〉 is the temporal fluctuation of the rate. The mean square error may have a minimum at some <lb/>finite Δ.

			<body>For the linear self-exciting point process, the power spectrum of the rate fluctuation or the Fourier transfor-<lb/>mation of the autocorrelation φ(s) ≡ 〈δλ(t + s)δλ(t)〉 was obtained by Hawkes 2 . The result can be summarized as 26 <lb/>φ <lb/>λ <lb/>= <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    − <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>ω <lb/>ω <lb/>ω <lb/>− <lb/>∼ <lb/>∼ <lb/>∼ <lb/>R h <lb/>R h <lb/>1 <lb/>(1 <lb/>)(1 <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>, <lb/>(13) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>where ω <lb/>∼ <lb/>h is the Fourier transform of the kernel function h(t). Because <lb/>∫ <lb/>∫ <lb/>φ <lb/>φ <lb/>δ λ <lb/>δ λ <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>−∞ <lb/>∞ <lb/>∼ <lb/>s ds <lb/>t s <lb/>t ds <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>) ( ) <lb/>, <lb/>the condition for the linear self-exciting process to be nonstationary is obtained as 1/(1 − R 0 ) 2 &gt; 2. Thus, the SN <lb/>transition occurs at = − <lb/>R <lb/>1 1/ 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>independent of the time course of supplementary probability h(t) and the <lb/>base rate ρ. <lb/>The multivariate Hawkes process (5) is also analytically tractable; in particular, the Fourier zero-mode of the <lb/>correlations φ(s) ≡ {φ ij (s)} ≡ {〈δλ i (t + s)δλ j (t)〉} is obtained as 3,26 , <lb/>φ <lb/>Λ <lb/>Λ <lb/>= <lb/>− . <lb/>∼ <lb/>L L <lb/>(14) <lb/>T <lb/>0 <lb/>Each node may exhibit the SN criticality if the correlation of each individual, φ ii (s), satisfies the SN condition. <lb/>Even when rate fluctuations are not detectable at any single node, the summed activity of multiple nodes may <lb/>exhibit fluctuations. The condition for the superposed series to exhibit the SN transition is obtained by applying <lb/>the nonstationary condition (8) to the summed rate λ <lb/>λ <lb/>= ∑ = <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>i <lb/>N <lb/>i <lb/>1 <lb/>, thus leading to the cascading condition, <lb/>equation (6). <lb/>Criticality conditions for extreme configurations.

			<body>Critical reproduction ratio of the scale-free network. Here, we derive the critical value R c in the scale <lb/>free network using degree based mean field approximation 48 .
