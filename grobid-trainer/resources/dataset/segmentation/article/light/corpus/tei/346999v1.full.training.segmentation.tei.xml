			<front>Abstract <lb/>Objective: Health system resilience and resilience of a country include the capacity of health <lb/>personnel, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises. This <lb/>study investigates the knowledge and attitudes of the public concerning Ebola Virus Disease in <lb/>Trinidad and Tobago. <lb/>Design and Methods: A cross sectional study whereby respondents (n = 920) were sampled from <lb/>public places. Data were collected via interviewer administered questionnaires. Data were <lb/>analysed using SPSS version 23. <lb/>Results: The response rate was 67.6 % (622/920). The main age category of responders was the <lb/>20 to 30 year age category (40.5%); responders were mostly female (58.0 %). Regarding <lb/>knowledge, there were significant differences among occupational categories (F = 2.811, df1 = 6, <lb/>df2 = 571, p-value = 0.011). Tukey&apos;s HSD post hoc test revealed that the mean knowledge scores <lb/>for professional and sales occupations differed significantly (p-value = 0.003). There was a <lb/>significant association between being afraid to go for treatment and age (p-value = 0.001). <lb/>Significant associations were also found between occupational grouping and education <lb/>attainment with opinion about the preparedness of private medical facilities, likelihood to shun <lb/>family members with Ebola, being afraid to go for treatment and preference for traditional <lb/>medicine (p-value &lt;0.05). <lb/>Conclusion: <lb/>This study highlights opportunities for community engagement to enhance health system <lb/>resilience during outbreaks which would maximise national and global health security. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Countries have been working to strengthen their alert and response capacities for acute public <lb/>health threats since 2007 under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) (1). Several <lb/>events have served to test these efforts such as the H1N1 Pandemic 2009, the 2011 Japan <lb/>earthquake and tsunami, the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, <lb/>various global terrorist events, Zika in the Americas in 2015 and the Ebola (EVD) outbreak in <lb/>West Africa in 2014/5 (1). Ebola constituted a Public Health Emergency of International <lb/>Concern as it left Africa for the first time, presenting a real threat to other countries. No longer <lb/>could Ebola be considered a disease of &apos;over there&apos; (2). The Ebola epidemic raised to the fore the <lb/>fragility of health systems. It showed what happens when a crisis hits and the health systems are <lb/>not prepared (3). <lb/>EVD is highly contagious with human to human spread via direct bodily contact with the blood, <lb/>secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. <lb/>bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. The case fatality rate is high if persons are not <lb/>treated (1,4). <lb/>With increased air travel and persons from West Africa setting abroad including in Trinidad and <lb/>with links to their home country, the likelihood of a case or a contact arriving into the country or <lb/>any country, though rare, is now possible. Countries need to increase their resilience i.e. the <lb/>intrinsic capacity of individuals, populations and infrastructure to rebound from shocks (5,6). <lb/>The status of Trinidad and Tobago&apos;s health systems preparedness is known from annual IHR <lb/>2005 status reports; it was therefore decided to seek the public&apos;s knowledge and attitudes on <lb/>Ebola as the community is a central player in in the emergency response and a successful <lb/>response relies on the participation and cooperation of the public. A well informed and well-<lb/>rehearsed public would be better able to act faster and effectively. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and Methods <lb/>Study Design <lb/>A cross-sectional survey was undertaken. <lb/>Study Period <lb/>The survey was undertaken from January to May 2016. <lb/>Study setting <lb/>The study was undertaken in public spaces in Trinidad and Tobago (TT), a twin island republic <lb/>in the chain of islands collectively termed the Caribbean. The population of TT is approximately <lb/>1.4 million persons (7). <lb/>Study Population <lb/>The study population comprised the adult (18 years and older) population of Trinidad and <lb/>Tobago. This included males and females of varying ethnic compositions, representative of the <lb/>general population. Responders were chosen by convenience sampling. Questionnaires were <lb/>distributed along busy streets, at malls, near bus stops, as well as other high traffic areas across <lb/>the different regions of Trinidad and Tobago. <lb/>Sample size <lb/>The sample size for the study was initially calculated at the onset as 913 responders. <lb/>Data Collection <lb/>A total of 920 questionnaires were distributed across Trinidad and Tobago. Responders were <lb/>briefed on the study&apos;s objectives before verbal consent was obtained for participation. <lb/>Interviewers assured the responders that their responses would be anonymous, that there would <lb/>be no way identifying them through the results. The questionnaire collected demographic <lb/>information, general knowledge and attitudes towards Ebola and views of responders on the <lb/>healthcare system in the country. <lb/></body>

			<body>Data analysis <lb/>All data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 23. A knowledge scale was constructed <lb/>using the sum total score of nineteen binary questions concerning respondents&apos; knowledge about <lb/>EVD. The two-sample independent t-test was used to compare the mean knowledge score <lb/>between males and females. An ANOVA test was used to determine whether there were <lb/>differences among categories in the age, occupation and education variables. Tukey&apos;s HSD <lb/>Procedure was carried out to determine which pairs of mean scores across occupational <lb/>categories differed (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05). In order to determine if there was a relationship <lb/>between the attitudes toward Ebola and demographic factors (age, gender, occupation and <lb/>education), Chi-Squared Tests of Independence were carried out. In the cases where at least <lb/>20% of the cells had expected counts less than 5, Fisher&apos;s Exact Test was used. <lb/>Ethical Approval <lb/>The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago Ethics Committee <lb/>granted ethical approval for this study (Reference: CEC063/11/15). <lb/>FINDINGS <lb/>A total of 920 participants were approached to participate of which 622 (67.6%) agreed. There <lb/>were 42% male and 58% female responders. The ethnic groups of the responders comprised <lb/>those of East Indian origin (35.9%), African origin (27.2%) and other, including mixed ethnicity <lb/>(36.9%). The majority of responders reported attaining tertiary education (55.6%) followed by <lb/>secondary education (41.1%).

			<body>Preparedness <lb/>Further Chi-Squared Tests were carried out to determine the dependence between having a preparedness <lb/>plan for an outbreak of EVD and demographic factors. In the cases where at least 20% of the cells had <lb/>expected counts less than 5, Fisher&apos;s Exact Test was used. It was found that preparedness did not depend <lb/>on demographic factors (p-values &gt; 0.05). <lb/>Obtaining Information about Ebola <lb/>Of the 598 respondents who responded to this question, 499 (83.4%) obtained information from various <lb/>forms of media. Of the 499 responders, the majority (53.3%) were under 30 years of age. However, it was <lb/>found that the method by which information was obtained was independent of the individual&apos;s age (p-value <lb/>= 0.673). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The study&apos;s response rate of 67% presented some useful findings about the public&apos;s knowledge <lb/>and attitudes towards Ebola. <lb/>Females outnumbered males but this was somewhat expected since the data collection took place <lb/>at shopping areas during the day time when more men than women are likely to be at work. The <lb/>study revealed some useful findings for improving health and healthcare during an outbreak. For <lb/>example, the significant difference in knowledge scores noted between professional and sales <lb/>occupations could direct health education measures towards certain occupational groupings. <lb/>There was no association between age group and knowledge scores; in Nigeria, sub optimal <lb/>knowledge was found among secondary school students despite a case of imported EVD in 2014 <lb/>(8). <lb/>There was a significant association between age group and being afraid to seek treatment. Fear of <lb/>seeking treatment suggests a lack of knowledge. The findings show that education level was also <lb/>significantly associated with being afraid to seek treatment. <lb/></body>

			<body>Occupational grouping and educational category were associated with likelihood to shun <lb/>someone with the disease, being afraid to go for treatment and choice of traditional medicine. <lb/>Education has been found to influence people&apos;s knowledge about EVD in Nigeria (9). In Uganda <lb/>being educated beyond primary level was a significant predictor of awareness towards EVD and <lb/>Marburg (10). Our survey showed a significant association between education level and <lb/>knowledge about EVD. These findings have potentially serious implications for the health <lb/>system during an outbreak and in peace time as this factor likely applies to all disease and <lb/>conditions. When patients are prepared to anticipate an untoward situation, they are more likely <lb/>to cope effectively (11). If persons do not present for treatment, their risk of a poor outcome <lb/>increases. If they are likely to shun those who are ill, the likelihood of spread would be greater <lb/>since infection control measures would not be maintained. A knowledge attitude and practices <lb/>survey undertaken in Liberia (12) found that more than 90% of responders were fearful of EVD <lb/>patients and of those who live with EVD patients. Choosing to attend traditional healers will lead <lb/>to further spread as these practitioners would not usually have personal protective equipment and <lb/>the appropriate training in their usage. <lb/>A cause for concern was the finding of the likelihood to shun someone with the disease if you <lb/>were in a caring occupation. The health workforce density in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia <lb/>which were the three most affected countries is less than 1.5 per 10 000 population, 2.2 per 10 <lb/>000 population and less than 3.7 per 10 000 population, respectively (13). In comparison, in TT <lb/>there are 8 physicians per 10000 people; there are 26 per 10 000 in the USA (14). According to <lb/>WHO at least 23 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population are needed for well -<lb/>functioning primary healthcare interventions (15). The workforce should be well-qualified, <lb/>capable, responsive and efficient. Lack of a skilled workforce was found to be a major factor in <lb/>controlling the outbreaks. Lack of knowledge about basic infection prevention and control <lb/>measures among health care workers was a critical factor in the outbreak response. Lack of PPE <lb/>and knowing who to report to affected the outcome of the outbreaks (7). Training and rehearsing <lb/>are critical to a smooth response (16,17,18). However it should be noted that in several studies <lb/>health workers indicated a reluctance to present to work under emergency conditions because of <lb/>competing priorities such as family responsibility. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Government and Public Health practitioners need to change the mindset of the public by <lb/>providing training and education. When persons are educated and possess the skills to manage a <lb/>disease which have been rehearsed the fears become less. <lb/>Responders obtained their information from various media sources. Media coverage can have a <lb/>great impact. Governments may therefore use this route for dissemination of clear, accurate <lb/>information during outbreaks (19). <lb/>The little confidence in the health system for handling an outbreak was attributed to a perception <lb/>that facilities are outdated along with an indifferent attitude. It is noteworthy that responders also <lb/>had little confidence in private facilities in addition to the public facilities. It seems the <lb/>Government of TT needs to act to change this perception and /modify their current strategy to <lb/>inform and educate the public. <lb/>The study shows many potential areas for capacity strengthening not only for EVD but for any <lb/>disease/event that poses a threat to national and thus global health security. The responders are <lb/>not totally incorrect in their perception that the country is not prepared for an outbreak, since <lb/>Trinidad and Tobago has not yet fully met its obligations under the IHR 2005. <lb/>To build a resilient health system there is a need for community engagement which can aid <lb/>containment efforts during an outbreak. In addition to the healthcare workers who need to train <lb/>and to exercise their preparedness plans, the community needs to be involved in the planning and <lb/>preparedness. In addition to health system strengthening in terms of surveillance and response <lb/>capacity to early detect and manage outbreaks, the community needs to be engaged and made <lb/>aware of the risks for each potential threat and of their roles and responsibilities in securing <lb/>national health security. This could address the issue of staff not presenting to work since <lb/>community involvement in planning could positively influence decisions healthcare workers take <lb/>during an emergency with respect to work and surge capacity. In Nigeria respondents suggested <lb/>sensitisation of communities for effective prevention and control. A survey in the USA stated the <lb/>need for honest accurate information, &apos;even if that information worried people.&apos; The survey <lb/>report indicated that &apos;These results suggest the value of proactive communications designed to <lb/></body>

			<body>inform the lay public&apos;s decisions, thoughts, and emotions, and informed by concurrent surveys of <lb/>their responses and needs&apos; (20). <lb/>Limitations <lb/>The study used convenience sampling which could affect the generalizability of the findings. In <lb/>terms of the response rate, the non-responders were in the minority. The demographic <lb/>characteristics (age, sex) of the non-responders were consistent with those of respondents and <lb/>hence we could have some confidence in the findings from the 622 responders. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Ebola virus disease was chosen for this study as this disease was of grave concern at the time of <lb/>the outbreaks since the disease left the African continent for the first time. To quote Dr Keiji <lb/>Fukuda, a WHO expert, &quot;what happens in Africa affects your neighborhood, either directly or <lb/>indirectly…the IHR are founded on that principle...but the world beyond public health remains <lb/>largely unconvinced of it. To really make strides against diseases like Ebola, we have to <lb/>convince people that there is no &quot;over there&quot; for infectious pathogens in a globalized world (2). <lb/>We therefore all need to be prepared at all times which means rehearsals and drills in the form of <lb/>table top exercises and multisectoral simulation exercises. Community support and involvement <lb/>are key. Sensitisation, communication and training are essential. Unfortunately lessons learned <lb/>from previous outbreaks are not being used to modify existing services and practices and for <lb/>each new public health event it seems we are starting from square one. An understanding of the <lb/>community perceptions about a public health threat is what is needed to be able to develop and <lb/>target information about the disease and its control (21). This study attempted to achieve this, to <lb/>aid the Government in its capacity building efforts to increase the country&apos;s resilience during a <lb/>major public health event. <lb/></body>
