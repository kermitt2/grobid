			<body>Fig. 1. Diagrams for (top) exclusive and (bottom) proton-dissociative vector-meson <lb/>photoproduction in ep interactions. The variables describing the kinematics of both <lb/>processes are introduced in Section 3. <lb/>1. Introduction <lb/>In exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons (VMs), <lb/>J /ψ and Υ , the masses of the charm and the bottom quarks pro-<lb/>vide a hard scale and the process can be described by models <lb/>based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) [1,2]. The interaction may be <lb/>viewed at leading order as shown in Fig. 1: the photon fluctuates <lb/>into a q q state of small transverse size, which interacts with par-<lb/>tons in the proton through a two-gluon colour-singlet state, form-<lb/>ing a heavy vector meson. Thus the cross section is proportional <lb/>to the square of the gluon density in the proton. A characteris-<lb/>tic feature of heavy VM photoproduction is the rapid rise of the <lb/>cross section with the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy, W . <lb/>This can be explained through the increasing gluon density with <lb/>decreasing fractional momentum, x ∝ 1/W 2 (where the x region <lb/>accessible in heavy-quark production at HERA is 10 −4 &lt; x &lt; 10 −2 ). <lb/>Numerous studies have shown that the dependence of the cross <lb/>section on W can be parameterised as σ ∝ W δ [3,4]. Measure-<lb/>ments for the J /ψ meson [5,6] yielded δ ≈ 0.7. A higher value of <lb/>δ ≈ 1.7 has been predicted for exclusive photoproduction of Υ (1S) <lb/>mesons in leading-order pQCD [7], consistent with the recent ZEUS <lb/>measurement: δ = 1.2 ± 0.8 [8]. <lb/>Studies of the exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy <lb/>vector mesons [3] have shown that the t dependence of the <lb/>differential cross section may be approximated in the region <lb/>of small t (|t| &lt; 1 GeV 2 ) with a single exponential: dσ /d|t| ∝ <lb/>exp(−b|t|), where t is the four-momentum transfer squared at <lb/>the proton vertex. The slope parameter, b, measured at ZEUS <lb/>for exclusive J /ψ production [5] at W 0 = 90 GeV is b = 4.15 ± <lb/>0.05(stat.) +0.30 <lb/>−0.18 (syst.) GeV −2 and exhibits a logarithmic variation: <lb/>b(W ) = b 0 + 2α ln(W /W 0 ) 2 , where α ≈ 0.1 GeV −2 . In an optical <lb/>model approach for exclusive production of VMs, the slope param-<lb/>eter b is related to the radii of the proton, R p , and the vector me-<lb/>son, R VM , according to the approximate formula: b ≈ (R 2 <lb/>p + R 2 <lb/>VM )/4. <lb/>The value of b measured for J /ψ production is approximately <lb/>equal to that expected from the size of the proton (b ≈ 4 GeV −2 ), <lb/>in agreement with calculations based on pQCD [9]. This suggests <lb/>that the size of the J /ψ is small compared to that of the pro-<lb/>ton. A similar picture is expected in the case of exclusive Υ (1S) <lb/>production [10,11]. <lb/>The present Letter reports on the first measurement of b in <lb/>exclusive Υ (1S) photoproduction, observed in the μ + μ − decay <lb/>channel in the kinematic range 60 &lt; W &lt; 220 GeV, and comple-<lb/>ments the previous results [8,12,13] on Υ (1S) photoproduction. <lb/>The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 468 pb −1 , col-<lb/>lected in the period 1996-2007. <lb/>2. Experimental set-up <lb/>In 1998-2007 (1996-1997), HERA provided electron 61 beams <lb/>of energy E e = 27.5 GeV and proton beams of energy E p = <lb/>920 (820) GeV, resulting in a centre-of-mass energy of <lb/>√ <lb/>s = <lb/>318 (300) GeV. <lb/>A detailed description of the ZEUS detector can be found else-<lb/>where [14]. A brief outline of the components that are most rele-<lb/>vant for this analysis is given below. <lb/>In the kinematic range of the analysis, charged particles were <lb/>tracked in the central tracking detector (CTD) [15-17] and, for the <lb/>data taken after 2001, also in the microvertex detector (MVD) [18]. <lb/>These components operated in a magnetic field of 1.43 T provided <lb/>by a thin superconducting solenoid. The CTD consisted of 72 cylin-<lb/>drical drift chamber layers, organised in nine superlayers covering <lb/>the polar-angle 62 region 15 • &lt; θ &lt; 164 • . The MVD provided polar <lb/>angle coverage from 7 • to 150 • . The transverse-momentum reso-<lb/>lution for full-length tracks was σ (p T )/p T = 0.0058p T ⊕ 0.0065 ⊕ <lb/>0.0014/p T , with p T in GeV, for data taken before 2001 and <lb/>σ (p T )/p T = 0.0029p T ⊕ 0.0081 ⊕ 0.0012/p T , for data taken after <lb/>2001. <lb/>The high-resolution uranium-scintillator calorimeter (CAL) <lb/>[19-22] consisted of three parts: the forward (FCAL), the barrel <lb/>(BCAL) and the rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part was subdivided <lb/>transversely into towers and longitudinally into one electromag-<lb/>netic section (EMC) and either one (in RCAL) or two (in BCAL <lb/>and FCAL) hadronic sections (HAC). The smallest subdivision of <lb/>the calorimeter is called a cell. The CAL energy resolutions, as <lb/>measured under test-beam conditions, are σ (E)/E = 0.18/ <lb/>√ <lb/>E for <lb/>electrons and σ (E)/E = 0.35/ <lb/>√ <lb/>E for hadrons, with E in GeV. <lb/>The muon system consisted of barrel, rear (B/RMUON) [23] and <lb/>forward (FMUON) [14] tracking detectors. The B/RMUON consisted <lb/>of limited-streamer (LS) tube chambers placed behind the BCAL <lb/>(RCAL), both inside and outside the magnetised iron yoke sur-<lb/>rounding the CAL. The barrel and rear muon chambers covered <lb/>polar angles from 34 • to 135 • and from 135 • to 171 • , respectively. <lb/>The FMUON consisted of six planes of LS tubes and four planes <lb/>of drift chambers covering the angular region from 5 • to 32 • . The <lb/>muon system exploited the magnetic field of the iron yoke and, in <lb/>the forward direction, of two iron toroids magnetised to 1.6 T to <lb/>provide an independent measurement of the muon momentum. <lb/>The iron yoke surrounding the CAL was instrumented with pro-<lb/>portional drift chambers to form the Backing Calorimeter (BAC) <lb/>[24]. The BAC consisted of 5142 aluminium chambers inserted into <lb/>the gaps between 7.3 cm thick iron plates (10, 9 and 7 layers in <lb/>61 Electrons and positrons are both referred to as electrons in this article. <lb/>62 The ZEUS coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system, with the Z <lb/>axis pointing in the proton beam direction, referred to as the &quot;forward direction&quot;, <lb/>and the X axis pointing left towards the centre of HERA. The coordinate origin was <lb/>located at the nominal interaction point for data collected before 2001. After 2001 <lb/>it was redefined as the centre of the CTD. The polar angle, θ , is measured with <lb/>respect to the proton beam direction. <lb/></body>

The anode wires were covered <lb/>by 50 cm long cathode pads. The BAC was equipped with energy <lb/>readout and position-sensitive readout for muon tracking. The for-<lb/>mer was based on 1692 pad towers (50 × 50 cm 2 ), providing an <lb/>energy resolution σ (E)/E = 1.0/ <lb/>√ <lb/>E, where E is expressed in GeV. <lb/>The position information from the wires allowed the reconstruc-<lb/>tion of muon trajectories in two dimensions ( X Y in barrel and Y Z <lb/>in endcaps) with a spatial accuracy of a few mm. <lb/>The luminosity was measured using the Bethe-Heitler reaction <lb/>ep → eγ p with the luminosity detector which consisted of inde-<lb/>pendent lead-scintillator calorimeter [25] and magnetic spectrom-<lb/>eter [26] systems. <lb/>3.

The exclusive <lb/>reaction under study <lb/>ep → eΥ p → eμ + μ − p <lb/>(1) <lb/>is described by the following variables (Fig. 1, top): <lb/>• s = (k + P ) 2 , the centre-of-mass energy squared of the <lb/>electron-proton system; <lb/>• Q 2 = −q 2 = −(k − k ) 2 , the negative four-momentum squared <lb/>of the exchanged photon; <lb/>• y = (q • P )/(k • P ), the fraction of the electron energy trans-<lb/>ferred to the hadronic final state in the rest frame of the <lb/>initial-state proton; <lb/>• W 2 = (q + P ) 2 = −Q 2 + 2 y(k • P ) + m 2 <lb/>p , the centre-of-mass <lb/>energy squared of the photon-proton system, where m p is the <lb/>proton mass; <lb/>• M μ + μ − , the invariant mass of the μ + μ − pair; <lb/>• t = (P − P ) 2 , the squared four-momentum transfer at the pro-<lb/>ton vertex, determined from the approximate formula: t ≈ <lb/>−(p + <lb/>x + p − <lb/>x ) 2 − (p + <lb/>y + p − <lb/>y ) 2 , where p ± <lb/>x, y are the components <lb/>of the transverse momentum of the decay muons. <lb/>The reaction ep → eΥ Y (Fig. 1, bottom), where Y denotes a <lb/>hadronic state originating from proton dissociation, constitutes an <lb/>important background. These events mimic exclusive Υ production <lb/>when the hadrons from proton dissociation remain undetected. <lb/>Events used in the analysis were restricted to Q 2 values <lb/>from the kinematic minimum, Q 2 <lb/>min = m 2 <lb/>e y 2 /(1 − y) ≈ 10 −9 GeV 2 , <lb/>where m e is the electron mass, to a value at which the scattered <lb/>electron starts to be observed in the CAL, Q 2 <lb/>max ≈ 1 GeV 2 , with <lb/>an estimated median Q 2 value of 10 −3 GeV 2 . The photon-proton <lb/>centre-of-mass energy can then be expressed as: <lb/>W 2 ≈ 4E p E e y ≈ 2E p (E − p Z ), <lb/>(2) <lb/>where E is the energy and p Z is the longitudinal momentum of <lb/>the μ + μ − pair. <lb/>The approximate formula for t introduces dispersion 3 times <lb/>smaller then that in the experimental resolution of this variable <lb/>after all event selections; approximation (2) has a negligible effect <lb/>in the case of W . <lb/>4. Event selection <lb/>Exclusive μ + μ − events in photoproduction were selected <lb/>online by requiring at least one CTD track associated with a <lb/>F/B/RMUON deposit or with a signal in the BAC consistent with <lb/>a muon. Owing to the inclusion of muon triggers based on signals <lb/>in the BAC [27,28], the rate of recorded dimuon events increased <lb/>by 17% for a third of the data as compared to the previous Υ (1S) <lb/>analysis [8]. Offline, events were selected as follows: <lb/>• two oppositely charged tracks forming a vertex and no other <lb/>tracks present in the central tracking system; <lb/>• position of the vertex consistent with an ep interaction; <lb/>• both tracks were required to have hits in at least 5 CTD super-<lb/>layers, to ensure a good momentum resolution; <lb/>• transverse momentum of each track p T &gt; 1.5 GeV; <lb/>• |η + − η − | 1.5, where η ± is the pseudorapidity 63 of a given <lb/>track, to suppress Bethe-Heitler background (Section 5); <lb/>• at least one track identified as a muon in the F/B/RMUON or <lb/>BAC, whenever available in a given event [29,30]; if not explic-<lb/>itly identified as a muon, the second track had to be associated <lb/>with a minimum-ionising energy deposit in the CAL; <lb/>• |π − α| &gt; 0.1, where α is the angle between the momentum <lb/>vectors of μ + and μ − , to reject cosmic-ray events; <lb/>• invariant mass M μ + μ − in the range between 5 and 15 GeV; <lb/>• the energy of each CAL cluster not associated to any of the <lb/>final-state muons was required to be less than 0.5 GeV, in or-<lb/>der to be above the noise level of the CAL. It implicitly selected <lb/>exclusive events with an effective cut Q 2 &lt; 1 GeV 2 ; <lb/>• the sum of the energy in the FCAL modules surrounding the <lb/>beam hole had to be smaller than 1 GeV [29,30] to suppress <lb/>the contamination from proton-dissociative events, ep → eΥ Y . <lb/>According to a Monte Carlo study, this corresponds to an effec-<lb/>tive cut on the mass M Y of the dissociated system originating <lb/>from the proton, M Y <lb/>4 GeV; <lb/>• photon-proton centre-of-mass energy 60 &lt; W &lt; 220 GeV and <lb/>four-momentum-transfer squared |t| &lt; 5 GeV 2 . <lb/>The total number of selected μ + μ − pairs was 2769. The contami-<lb/>nation of this sample with cosmic ray muons is less then 1%. <lb/>5. Monte Carlo simulation <lb/>The detector and trigger acceptance and the effects due to de-<lb/>tector response were determined using samples of Monte Carlo <lb/>(MC) events. Exclusive and proton-dissociative vector-meson pro-<lb/>duction were simulated with the DIFFVM 2.0 generator [31]. For <lb/>proton-dissociative events, the simulation was supplemented by <lb/>the JETSET 7.3 MC package [32]. For exclusive vector-meson pro-<lb/>duction, s-channel helicity conservation (SCHC) was assumed. An <lb/>exponential dependence, e −b|t| , was assumed for the differential <lb/>cross section in t with a slope parameter b = 4.5 GeV −2 , consistent <lb/>with the value obtained for exclusive J /ψ electroproduction [5, <lb/>6]. The W dependence of the γ p → Υ p cross section was pa-<lb/>rameterised as ∝ W δ , with δ = 1.2 [8]. Electromagnetic radiative <lb/>corrections associated with the decay muons are of the order of <lb/>1% [33] and were not included in the simulation. <lb/>The non-resonant background, consisting of the exclusive and <lb/>proton-dissociative Bethe-Heitler (BH) dimuon events, was simu-<lb/>lated using the GRAPE v1.1k MC program [34]. After event selec-<lb/>tion, the contribution of the proton-dissociative events was 25% of <lb/>the Bethe-Heitler MC sample. <lb/>All MC events were generated in the full kinematic range and <lb/>processed through the simulation of the ZEUS detector based on <lb/>the GEANT program 64 [35] and were analysed with the same re-<lb/>63 Pseudorapidity is defined as η = − ln (tan θ <lb/>2 ). <lb/>64 Version 3.13 for the 1996-2000 and 3.21 for the 2003-2007 periods, respec-<lb/>tively. <lb/></body>

In addition, correc-<lb/>tions [29,30] of the muon-detector efficiencies determined from a <lb/>data set consisting of J /ψ and Bethe-Heitler exclusive production <lb/>events were applied. <lb/>6. Determination of the b slope <lb/>The invariant-mass distribution of μ + μ − pairs after applying <lb/>the selection criteria is shown in Fig. 2. The simulated contribu-<lb/>tions from the Bethe-Heitler (exclusive and proton dissociative) <lb/>process and from the Υ (1S), Υ (2S) and Υ (3S) resonances are <lb/>also presented. 65 As in the previous paper [8], the BH distribu-<lb/>tions were normalised to the data in the range [5.0-15.0] GeV <lb/>excluding the [9.0-11.0] GeV mass window where contributions <lb/>from the Υ resonances are expected. For the determination of the <lb/>slope parameter for exclusive Υ (1S) production, only events in the <lb/>mass window [9.33-9.66] GeV were considered. The width of the <lb/>mass window was chosen in order to avoid excessive smearing of <lb/>the t variable and to retain a good signal-to-background ratio. Ac-<lb/>cording to MC studies, 71% of all reconstructed Υ (1S) events are <lb/>expected in this window; the relative contaminations of Υ (2S) <lb/>and Υ (3S) states with respect to Υ (1S) are 1.3% and 0.1%, re-<lb/>spectively. The contribution from the Υ (2S) and Υ (3S) states was <lb/>neglected for the extraction of the slope parameter b. After scan-<lb/>ning no cosmic ray muon candidates were found in the signal mass <lb/>window. <lb/>The value of the slope parameter for exclusive Υ (1S) produc-<lb/>tion was determined as follows: the sum of simulated distribu-<lb/>tions of all contributing processes was fitted to the observed event <lb/>yields in the signal mass window [9.33-9.66] GeV in the four t <lb/>bins shown in Fig. 3. A binned Poissonian log-likelihood function, <lb/>ln(L), was used. The expected number of Bethe-Heitler background <lb/>events was fixed to the value obtained from the μ + μ − spectrum <lb/>outside the signal region as described earlier. Due to insufficient <lb/>statistics it was not possible to evaluate the contribution of proton-<lb/>dissociative Υ (1S) events in the final sample with the present <lb/>data. However, the fraction of such events, f pdiss , is expected to be <lb/>similar in all diffractive vector-meson production processes [37]. <lb/>Therefore, the value f pdiss = 0.25 ± 0.05, determined for diffractive <lb/>J /ψ production [5], was used. The values of the slope parameter <lb/>for the exclusive and proton dissociative Υ (1S) production pro-<lb/>cesses differ [38]; in the MC the value for the latter was taken to <lb/>be b pdiss = 0.65 ± 0.1 GeV −2 [5]. <lb/>The fit was performed with two free parameters: the slope <lb/>b and the number of expected Υ (1S) events in the signal mass <lb/>window. During the parameter scan, the contribution of the ex-<lb/>clusive Υ (1S) production to the t distribution was reweighted at <lb/>generator level to the function b • exp(−b|t|). The small statistical <lb/>uncertainties of the MC sample were neglected in the fit. The fit <lb/>yielded: b = 4.3 +2.0 <lb/>−1.3 (stat.) GeV −2 and 41 ± 10Υ (1S) events (44% <lb/>of the events in this mass window). The fit provides a good de-<lb/>scription of the data; the equivalent χ 2 is 0.61 for 2 degrees of <lb/>freedom. <lb/>7. Systematic uncertainties <lb/>The following sources of systematic uncertainty were consid-<lb/>ered, where the numbers in parenthesis correspond to the uncer-<lb/>tainties on b in GeV −2 : <lb/>65 The ratio of the number of events N Υ (1S) : N Υ (2S) : N Υ (3S) was fixed in the MC <lb/>to 0.73 : 0.19 : 0.08 according to a CDF measurement [36] of the production of Υ <lb/>resonances. <lb/>Fig. 2. Invariant mass distribution of μ + μ − pairs. The dashed line shows the simu-<lb/>lated Bethe-Heitler (BH) (exclusive and proton dissociative) distribution, normalised <lb/>to the data points in the range [5.0-15.0] GeV excluding the [9.0-11.0] GeV mass <lb/>window. Simulated contributions of the Υ (1S), Υ (2S) and Υ (3S) resonances are <lb/>shown as a histogram on the mass axis (dashed-dotted line). The solid line shows <lb/>the sum of all contributions. <lb/>Fig. 3. Measured |t| distribution (full dots) with error bars denoting statistical un-<lb/>certainties. Fitted distributions for simulated events are shown for the Bethe-Heitler <lb/>(dashed line), exclusive Υ (1S) (dotted line) and proton dissociative Υ (1S) (dashed-<lb/>dotted line) processes. The solid line shows the sum of all contributions. <lb/>• f pdiss was varied between 0.2 and 0.3, as determined from <lb/>J /ψ production [5] ( +0.30 <lb/>−0.25 ); <lb/>• b pdiss was varied by +0.7 <lb/>−0.1 GeV −2 . In addition to the uncertainty <lb/>from J /ψ production quoted earlier, the upper variation was <lb/>extended to the value b pdiss = 1.35 GeV −2 obtained for this <lb/>parameter when it was also fitted ( −0.4 <lb/>+0.1 ); <lb/>• the contribution of BH events in the mass window [9.33-9.66] <lb/>GeV was varied between 55.3% and 56.7%, according to the <lb/>statistical uncertainty of its normalisation ( +0.15 <lb/>−0.10 ); <lb/>• the fraction of proton-dissociative to all BH events was varied <lb/>in the range 0.22 to 0.28 (±0.30). <lb/>Variation of the parameter δ between 0.7 and 1.7 and variations <lb/>of the offline selection cuts lead to a negligible contribution to the <lb/>b uncertainty. The total systematic uncertainty was determined by <lb/>adding the individual contributions in quadrature. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 4. Comparison of the HERA measurements of the slope parameter b as a func-<lb/>tion of the scale Q 2 + M 2 <lb/>VM for exclusive Υ (1S) production (the rightmost data <lb/>point), for other exclusive vector-meson production [39-41,38,42-44,5,6] and for <lb/>deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) [45-47]. <lb/>8. Result and discussion <lb/>The slope parameter b for the exclusive production of Υ (1S) <lb/>mesons was measured to be b = 4.3 +2.0 <lb/>−1.3 (stat.) +0.5 <lb/>−0.6 (syst.) GeV −2 . <lb/>A comparison of all HERA measurements of the slope parameter <lb/>b for exclusive light and heavy vector meson production and for <lb/>deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) is shown in Fig. 4. This <lb/>analysis doubles the range covered by previous measurements in <lb/>terms of Q 2 + M 2 <lb/>VM , where M VM denotes the mass of a vector <lb/>meson. The measured value is in agreement with an asymptotic <lb/>behaviour of this dependence, reflecting the proton radius. This <lb/>was already suggested by earlier measurements and is consistent <lb/>with predictions based on pQCD models (b = 3.68 GeV −2 ) [11]. <lb/>9. Conclusions <lb/>The exclusive photoproduction reaction γ p → Υ (1S) p was <lb/>studied with the ZEUS detector in ep collisions at HERA using <lb/>an integrated luminosity of 468 pb −1 collected in the period <lb/>1996-2007. The analysis covered the kinematic range 60 &lt; W &lt; <lb/>220 GeV and Q 2 &lt; 1 GeV 2 . The measurement of the exponen-<lb/>tial slope of the t dependence yielded b = 4.3 +2.0 <lb/>−1.3 (stat.) +0.5 <lb/>−0.6 (syst.) <lb/>GeV −2 . This is the first determination of the b parameter for Υ (1S) <lb/>production. The result is in agreement with expectations of an <lb/>asymptotic behaviour of the slope parameter as a function of the <lb/>effective scale present in the process, Q 2 + M 2 <lb/>VM . This measure-<lb/>ment extends the value of the scale to ≈ 90 GeV 2 , the highest <lb/>achieved to date in the measurement of the t-slope parameter for <lb/>a vector meson. <lb/></body>
