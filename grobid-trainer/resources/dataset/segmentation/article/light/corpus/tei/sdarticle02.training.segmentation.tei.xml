			<body>1. Introduction<lb/> Fatigue has been found to be a significant health<lb/> complaint in myocardial infarction (MI) patients [1–4],	as<lb/> well as something that is difficult to cope with [5]. A wide<lb/> range of definitions are found in the literature. Fatigue is a<lb/> multidimensional construct with components of general,<lb/> physical, and mental fatigue, as well as reduced activity and<lb/> motivation [6]. Fatigue can be distinguished from tiredness<lb/> by defining a continuum along which fatigue is a state<lb/> existing anywhere between the two poles tiredness and<lb/> exhaustion [7]. High rates of depression [8–10] and anxiety<lb/> [10,11] have been found among patients who have suffered<lb/> an MI. Fatigue and depression may be different expressions<lb/> of the same phenomenon [12,13], or they may tend to<lb/> overlap, as fatigue is a key symptom of depression [14,15].<lb/> Nevertheless, fatigue is sometimes experienced by myocar-<lb/>dial infarction patients without coexisting depression [3],<lb/> and therefore measures of physical components of fatigue<lb/> </body>

			<body>could be valuable in combination with measures of<lb/> depression.<lb/> Adaptation after MI entails adjustment to illness con-<lb/>sequences [16,17], management of behavioural and lifestyle<lb/> changes [18,19] and a desire to return to normal [20].<lb/> Few studies of adaptation after MI have explicitly focused<lb/> on fatigue and sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance refers to<lb/> an imbalance of sleep and wakefulness during a night of<lb/> sleep [21–23]. The mean sleep time for an adult, up to<lb/> 64 years of age, is about 7.5 h [24,25]. One study conducted<lb/> one year after percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-<lb/>plasty (PTCA) showed that physical tiredness/fatigue was<lb/> the greatest consequence of disturbed sleep [26]. A recent<lb/> interview study of patients with coronary artery disease<lb/> (CAD) revealed that personal lifestyle was reflected in sleep<lb/> behaviour, showing that maintaining a balance between<lb/> sleep, rest and activities resulted in better sleep quality [27].<lb/> Women report a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances<lb/> [23–25,28,29]. This is in line with results from studies on<lb/> women with CAD, who report sleep disturbances more<lb/> frequently than men do [30,31]. Sleeplessness behaviour,<lb/> depressed mood and female gender were associated with poor<lb/> sleep quality in CAD patients [32].<lb/> Disturbed sleep has been linked to increased morbidity<lb/> and mortality [33–35], depression [36,37], and worsened<lb/> health-related quality of life in patients with chronic illness<lb/> [38]. Poor prognosis has been described in MI or CAD<lb/> patients who have poor sleep quality [14], and there is an<lb/> increased risk for CAD in persons with disturbed sleep [39].<lb/> The negative effects of sleep disturbance on health,<lb/> together with frequent experiences of mental distress and<lb/> fatigue after MI, make it important to further explore this<lb/> field. Therefore, the present study had two primary aims: 1.<lb/> to explore associations between disturbed sleep, fatigue,<lb/> anxiety and depression four months after MI, and 2. to assess<lb/> to what extent fatigue four months post-MI could be<lb/> explained by disturbed sleep, anxiety and depression.<lb/> 2. Methods<lb/> 2.1. Subjects and procedures<lb/> The present study included MI patients, ≤80 years of age,<lb/> who had been admitted to the coronary care unit in two<lb/> Swedish hospital from October 2005 to September 2006, and<lb/> who participated in a longitudinal follow-up study of<lb/> readjustment one week and four months after MI. Excluded<lb/> were patients with other severe diseases and/or a greatly<lb/> limited life expectancy (e.g., due to cancer), patients who<lb/> were not able to participate (e.g., due to stroke and dementia<lb/> disorders) and patients who could not speak Swedish<lb/> fluently. Of the 236 invited patients, 204 (144 men, 60<lb/> women) agreed to participate (response rate 87%). Demo-<lb/>graphic and medical data were obtained from hospital charts<lb/> and from a questionnaire finalized during the first week in<lb/> hospital. The demographic data covered age, gender and<lb/> living alone or together. The medical data covered previous<lb/> diagnosis (hypertension, hyperlipedemia, angina pectoris,<lb/> previous MI, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and<lb/> left ventricular ejection fraction) and acute treatment (beta-<lb/>blocker medication, percutaneous coronary intervention<lb/> (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and<lb/> thrombolysis. Infarct size was measured using the biochem-<lb/>ical marker Troponin I (TNI). Left ventricular ejection<lb/> fraction was measured using transthoracic echocardiography<lb/> and is presented in percent.<lb/> Four months after the MI, the patients answered<lb/> questionnaires about sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety and<lb/> depression.<lb/> The project was approved by the Research Ethics<lb/> Committee at the University of Gothenburg. The informants<lb/> gave their informed written consent to participate, and the<lb/> investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the<lb/> Declaration of Helsinki [40].<lb/> 2.2. Questionnaires<lb/> 2.2.1. Disturbed sleep<lb/> Initially, nine questions regarding sleep disturbance,<lb/> previously used as separate items in studies at Sahlgrenska<lb/> University Hospital, Sweden e.g., [41], and also found to be<lb/> included in the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ) [42],<lb/> were analysed. The nine items were tested for reliability to<lb/> form a scale. The inter-item correlations for all items were<lb/> not fully satisfactory. Therefore, in the first step, two of them<lb/> were excluded due to doubtful content (nightmares and<lb/> involuntary sleep episodes during day-time). The Cronbach<lb/> alpha coefficient for the scale with seven items was 0.80. In<lb/> the second step, we excluded two more items with low inter-<lb/>item correlations (difficulty waking and taking sleeping<lb/> pills). Cronbach&apos;s alpha coefficient increased to 0.83 and the<lb/> inter-item correlations were good and indicated that the<lb/> remaining five items could be summed to form a scale about<lb/> sleep disturbance after MI. The final 5 items included in the<lb/> questionnaire were related to disturbed or troubled sleep,<lb/> difficulties initiating sleep, repeated nocturnal awakenings<lb/> associated with difficulties returning to sleep, a feeling of<lb/> non-refreshing sleep upon awakening, and premature<lb/> awakening from sleep. Each question was answered using<lb/> a 6-point scale with scores from never (1) to always (6)<lb/> (range 5–30).<lb/> 2.2.2. Fatigue<lb/> Fatigue was measured using the Somatic Health Com-<lb/>plaints Questionnaire (SHCQ). This questionnaire addresses<lb/> 13 health issues concerning common health problems in<lb/> cardiac patients [43]. In the present study, the subscale<lb/> fatigue, consisting of the four items general fatigue,<lb/> weakness, lack of energy and dizziness, was used. Each<lb/> question was answered using a 6-point scale with scores<lb/> from never (1) to always (6) (range 4–24). The Cronbach&apos;s<lb/> alpha coefficient in the present sample was 0.87.<lb/>

			2.2.3. Anxiety and depression<lb/> The Hospital-Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD) is a 14-item<lb/> questionnaire comprising two scales, one for anxiety (seven<lb/> questions) and one for depression (seven questions). All items<lb/> were scored on a 4-point scale from low anxiety/depression (0)<lb/> to high anxiety/depression (3) [44]. The HAD Scale was<lb/> developed for measuring mental distress in patients with<lb/> physical illness and has been found to be a reliable instrument<lb/> for detecting severity of emotional distress, with Cronbach&apos;s<lb/> alpha between 0.80 and 0.93 [45]. On either the anxiety or<lb/> depression subscale, a score of 7 or less is considered normal, a<lb/> score of 8–10 is considered to indicate possible and 11 or<lb/> higher to indicate probable psychological distress.<lb/> 2.3. Statistical analyses<lb/> The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 15.0<lb/> was used. Descriptive statistics were calculated: mean (m) and<lb/> standard deviations (SD). Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficients (r)<lb/> were used to explore associations between variables. Gender<lb/> differences were tested using independent sample t-tests. To<lb/> identify variables that best predicted fatigue in myocardial<lb/> infarction patients, a multiple regression model was used with<lb/> sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, gender and age as<lb/> independent variables. A p-value b 0.05 was considered sta-<lb/>tistically significant.<lb/> 3. Results<lb/> 3.1. Demographic data<lb/> Table 1 shows the characteristics of the participating<lb/> patients, including medical information. The mean age was<lb/> 64 years (SD = 10, range 31–80) and 30% were women. One<lb/> fourth of the sample had a diagnosis of at least one previous<lb/> MI. Only 7% suffered from congestive heart failure, and<lb/> nearly one fourth were hyperlipidemic. The acute treatment<lb/> included CABG in 7% and PCI in 70% of the sample.<lb/> 3.2. Disturbed sleep<lb/> Means, SDs and ranges for disturbed sleep measured as<lb/> described above are displayed in Table 2. The theoretical ranges<lb/> of scale scores were well covered by the observed scores for all<lb/> four scales. A gender difference was identified; women<lb/> reported more disturbed sleep (p b 0.05). Difficulties falling<lb/> asleep during the past week were reported by 21% of the<lb/> individuals four months after the MI. A feeling of non-<lb/>refreshing sleep upon awakening was the most common sleep<lb/> complaint (Table 3). Of all patients, 55% reported sleep<lb/> disturbance sometimes to always, 45% reported almost no sleep<lb/> disturbance at all, and 79% did not use any sleep medication.<lb/> 3.3. Fatigue<lb/> One third of the MI patients reported fatigue often to<lb/> always (summed SHCQ scale scores between 13 and 24),<lb/> one third reported fatigue sometimes, and 35% experienced<lb/> hardly any fatigue at all. No difference between women and<lb/> men was identified (Table 2).<lb/> 3.4. Anxiety and depression<lb/> According to the HAD scale, one fourth of the MI patients<lb/> scored possible or probable anxiety, and 20% scored<lb/> possible or probable depression. Regarding anxiety a<lb/> difference between women and men was identified (Table 2).<lb/> 3.5.

			previous MI were not significantly correlated with disturbed<lb/> sleep, fatigue, anxiety or depression. The variables disturbed<lb/> sleep, anxiety and depression were all associated with fatigue<lb/> (Table 4).<lb/> To further explore these associations, a regression model<lb/> was analysed with fatigue as the dependent variable and<lb/> disturbed sleep, anxiety and depression as independent<lb/> variables, controlling for age and gender. The regression<lb/> model accounted for 46% of the variance in fatigue, with<lb/> depression and disturbed sleep as strong predictors.<lb/> Additionally, age, but not gender, was related to fatigue<lb/> (Table 5).<lb/> 4. Discussion<lb/> Four months after the acute heart attack, one third of the<lb/> patients reported fatigue sometimes too often. Also, around<lb/> 20% reported sleep disturbance. Medical variables such as<lb/> enzymatically estimated infarct size or left ventricular ejection<lb/> fraction were not related to the individuals&apos; experience of<lb/> fatigue. However, our findings showing relationships between<lb/> disturbed sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression point out that<lb/> these aspects are important in rehabilitation care, especially<lb/> with aging people. In a multiple regression model analysis, it<lb/> was found that both depression and disturbed sleep explained a<lb/> great deal of the variance in fatigue.<lb/> Many individuals who have suffered an MI report fatigue<lb/> prior to the acute heart event [46], and many patients report<lb/> fatigue after MI [5,47,48]. The prevalence of fatigue in CAD<lb/> patients tends to be higher among women [3,32] and is linked<lb/> to increased prevalence of depression and anxiety [3,15].<lb/> Fatigue has been found to be associated with subjective sleep<lb/> quality in the general population [15] and fragmented sleep in<lb/> CAD patients [26]. Also, poor prognosis in female coronary<lb/> patients was associated with poor sleep and sleep without a<lb/> restorative function [49]. In the present study, we identified<lb/> some gender differences; women reported more anxiety and<lb/> disturbed sleep, but did not report higher rates of fatigue.<lb/> In the literature, there are several terms for an individual&apos;s<lb/> report of difficulty with sleep. Commonly used concepts are<lb/> insomnia and disturbed sleep, both including for example<lb/> difficulty falling asleep, problems with staying asleep and/or<lb/> non-restorative sleep [50,51]. Nevertheless, measures of<lb/> insomnia and disturbed sleep vary across studies, and<lb/> therefore it may be difficult to compare the results. About<lb/> 18% of the general population report sleep dissatisfaction<lb/> [29,52], and this proportion is in line with that found among<lb/> the individuals who have suffered an MI in the present study<lb/> and in a former study of MI patients [2]. In the present study,<lb/> one problem associated with identifying disturbed sleep due<lb/> to the heart attack itself is that we do not know the prevalence<lb/> of impaired sleep before the MI. However, one possible<lb/> reflection is that sleep disturbance after MI may be<lb/> associated with the illness. Due to anxiety and worries<lb/> about illness consequences, insomnia problems may occur.<lb/> Physical functioning may be reduced, implying decreased<lb/> physical activity and exercise, which in turn may negatively<lb/> influence sleep quality. Also, experiences of fatigue may<lb/> lead to day-time rests or naps, which in turn may influence<lb/> the quality of night-time sleep.<lb/> To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the<lb/> effects of any treatment on disturbed sleep among post-MI<lb/> patients. Individuals with insomnia are more likely to have a<lb/> major depressive illness [29]. When depression is the main<lb/> cause of sleep disturbance, anti-depressive therapy might be<lb/> required. Individuals who were distressed in the hospital<lb/> experienced lowered health-related quality of life four<lb/> months [53] and one year after MI [11], and therefore, in-<lb/>hospital identification and treatment of anxiety and depres-<lb/>sion could be of benefit to patients&apos; prognosis. Nurses should<lb/> increase their awareness regarding anxiety, depression and<lb/> fatigue as well as regarding the impact of sleep disturbance<lb/> on health and well-being. Johansson et al. [27] concluded<lb/> that it is important to identify patients&apos; needs, symptoms and<lb/> self-care strategies regarding impaired sleep.<lb/> 4.1. Limitations<lb/> One limitation of the present study was that sleep<lb/> disturbance was not examined before MI, and thus we<lb/> cannot determine whether these problems were new and due<lb/> to illness consequences. The results only reflect the situation<lb/> Table 3<lb/> Prevalence of disturbed sleep (from several times to always).<lb/> Items of sleep disturbance (n = 204)<lb/> %<lb/> 1.

			four months after an MI. It might be worthwhile to perform a<lb/> prolonged follow-up for several years. Such a study could<lb/> provide the opportunity to estimate the medical risks and<lb/> morbidity resulting from sleep disturbance post-MI, and the<lb/> possible beneficial effects of a well-performed nursing inter-<lb/>vention intended to increase sleep quality. Regarding the few<lb/> identified gender differences in the present study, the small<lb/> sample size of women could have camouflaged such differ-<lb/>ences. However, to guarantee satisfactory representatively,<lb/> we performed the data collection during a period of one<lb/> year and included every consecutive patient admitted to a<lb/> rural coronary care unit with a diagnosis of an acute MI.<lb/> This procedure resulted in more male participants due to<lb/> the difference in incidence of MI between men and wom-<lb/>en ≤80 years of age.<lb/> The items used for assessing disturbed sleep in the present<lb/> study reflect a basis for insomnia symptoms that did not<lb/> include an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) evaluation.<lb/> Coronary heart disease has been associated with OSA. A<lb/> high prevalence of OSA in patients with acute myocardial<lb/> infarction has been identified [54]. Some of the participants<lb/> in our sample may have suffered from problems with sleep<lb/> apnea causing depression, fatigue and non-restorative sleep,<lb/> while others may have experienced disturbed sleep for other<lb/> reasons. The item &quot;a feeling of non-refreshing sleep upon<lb/> awakening&quot; was the most common sleep complaint (reported<lb/> by 23% of the respondents), which could be a sign of OSA.<lb/> In future research, this distinction should be accounted for.<lb/> 5. Conclusion<lb/> Associations between sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety<lb/> and depression were identified. Infarct size measured using<lb/> conventional biochemical markers, left ventricle ejection<lb/> fraction and history of previous MI were not correlated with<lb/> disturbed sleep, fatigue, anxiety or depression. Thus, psycho-<lb/>social symptoms and needs are important to recognize owing to<lb/> their influence on health and well-being. Based on knowledge<lb/> about associations between disturbed sleep, fatigue and<lb/> psychological distress such as anxiety and depression, cardiac<lb/> nurses could be trained to observe such symptoms. Optimal<lb/> care of sleep disturbance may include measures to reduce<lb/> anxiety and depression as well as self-care advice on sleep<lb/> hygiene intended to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue.<lb/>
