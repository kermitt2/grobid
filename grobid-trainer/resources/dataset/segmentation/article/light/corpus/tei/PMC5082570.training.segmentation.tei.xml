			<body>Introduction <lb/>The human flavoproteome comprises 90 enzymes with <lb/>versatile functions, structures, and protein characteris-<lb/>tics. Sixty percent of the known flavoproteins are <lb/>involved in human diseases and disorders emphasizing <lb/>their importance in human metabolism [1]. The human <lb/>mitochondrial matrix flavoprotein dimethylglycine <lb/>dehydrogenase (hDMGDH, EC: 1.5.8.4) catalyzes the <lb/>oxidative demethylation of dimethylglycine (DMG) to <lb/>sarcosine, and also to a lesser extent the conversion of <lb/>sarcosine to glycine as part of choline degradation <lb/>(Fig. 1) [2,3]. Choline is an essential nutrient and <lb/>building block in a variety of vital biomolecules such <lb/>as the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine <lb/>and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [4]. Degrada-<lb/>tion of choline proceeds by consecutive oxidations <lb/>via betaine aldehyde, betaine, dimethylglycine, and <lb/></body>

			<body>sarcosine to the amino acid glycine (Fig. 1) [5]. <lb/>hDMGDH, a key enzyme of this pathway, requires <lb/>two cofactors: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and <lb/>tetrahydrofolate (THF). The FAD is covalently <lb/>attached via its 8a-position to the N3 of a histidyl resi-<lb/>due and serves as the electron acceptor in the oxida-<lb/>tion of DMG. On the other hand, THF is used as the <lb/>acceptor of the incipient methyl group and thus pre-<lb/>vents the release of cell-toxic formaldehyde during <lb/>catalysis [3,6]. In the course of this reaction, N-5,10-<lb/>methylene tetrahydrofolate is formed, which plays an <lb/>important role in one-carbon metabolism. Regenera-<lb/>tion of oxidized FAD is achieved by electron transfer <lb/>to the human electron-transferring flavoprotein <lb/>(hETF), which in turn transfers the electrons to the <lb/>membrane-anchored ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase <lb/>(ETF-QO) for further utilization in the mitochondrial <lb/>respiratory chain [7,8]. <lb/>A rare naturally occurring point mutation found in <lb/>out of 118 656 (0.049%) analyzed human gene <lb/>sequences (Exome Aggregation Consortium online <lb/>browser; http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/5-78351 <lb/>682-T-C) results in the exchange of histidine 109 to <lb/>arginine (H109R). This variant reportedly suffers from <lb/>lower stability and enzymatic activity [9,10]. The <lb/>observed phenotype was described as dimethylglycine <lb/>dehydrogenase deficiency with significantly higher <lb/>levels of dimethylglycine in human body fluids causing <lb/>muscle fatigue and a fish-like odor (OMIM: 605850). <lb/>Interestingly, the mutation is predominantly found in <lb/>individuals of African descent. <lb/>In recent years, also the product of the reaction cat-<lb/>alyzed by hDMGDH, sarcosine, attracted attention as <lb/>a biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer [11,12]. <lb/>Therefore, investigations on the regulation of sarcosine <lb/>levels and the enzymes involved are in the focus of <lb/>research. Furthermore, a recent epidemiological study <lb/>revealed a possible connection of dimethylglycine dehy-<lb/>drogenase deficiency to the development of diabetes, <lb/>further emphasizing the importance of the enzyme [13]. <lb/>Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) was first <lb/>identified and purified from rat liver in the 1950s and <lb/>early 1960s [14,15]. Since then several publications <lb/>have dealt with the characterization of mammalian <lb/>dimethylglycine dehydrogenases from rat [2,3,16] and <lb/>pig liver [8] as well as the recombinant rat [17,18] and <lb/>human enzyme [19] using Escherichia coli as expression <lb/>host. Furthermore, dimethylglycine oxidase from <lb/>Arthrobacter globiformis (AgDMGO) was character-<lb/>ized in biochemical and structural detail [6,20-23]. <lb/>However, the available information on the hDMGDH <lb/>appears insufficient and partly contradictory. In order <lb/>to overcome these deficiencies, we present a profound <lb/>analysis of the recombinant hDMGDH and the <lb/>H109R variant concerning kinetics, redox behavior, <lb/>and spectral properties. Furthermore, we have eluci-<lb/>dated the crystal structure of the human wild-type <lb/>enzyme. <lb/>THF <lb/>N-5,10-methylene-THF <lb/>Sarcosine <lb/>FAD + <lb/>FADH 2 <lb/>ETF <lb/>DMGDH <lb/>Glycine <lb/>CH 3 <lb/>ETF-QO <lb/>One-carbon metabolism <lb/>Mitochondrial respiratory chain <lb/>Choline <lb/>CHD <lb/>Dimethylglycine <lb/>PIPOX <lb/>2 e -<lb/>BAD <lb/>BHMT <lb/>DMGDH <lb/>SARDH <lb/>GNMT <lb/>H 3 C <lb/>H 3 C <lb/>H 3 C <lb/>H 2 N <lb/>H 3 C <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>O <lb/>OH <lb/>OH <lb/>OH <lb/>O <lb/>O <lb/>H <lb/>N <lb/>+ <lb/>CH 3 <lb/>CH 3 <lb/>OH <lb/>Fig. 1.

Conversion of dimethylglycine (DMG) to sarcosine by DMGDH reduces the FAD cofactor and a methyl group <lb/>is donated to THF resulting in FADH 2 and N-5,10-methylene-THF. The enzyme is reoxidized by the interaction with hETF and the derived <lb/>electrons are further channeled by ETF-QO to the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

DMGDH is the only enzyme converting <lb/>dimethylglycine to sarcosine and the only other known route to sarcosine is via glycine N-methyl transferase (GNMT). Sarcosine is further <lb/>converted to glycine, mostly by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), and is also a substrate for dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and <lb/>peroxisomal sarcosine oxidase (PIPOX). <lb/></body>

			<body>In order to characterize hDMGDH, we have estab-<lb/>lished a recombinant expression system for the <lb/>wild-type and the H109R variant in Komagataella phaffii <lb/>(formerly known as Pichia pastoris or Komagataella pas-<lb/>toris [24]) and a subsequent purification protocol. This <lb/>approach enabled us to determine key kinetic parame-<lb/>ters as well as physical and spectroscopic properties of <lb/>wild-type DMGDH. Consequently, we have also <lb/>employed our expression system to generate the <lb/>H109R variant to address the putative loss of function <lb/>that leads to DMGDH-deficiency in humans. More-<lb/>over, successful crystallization of the WT and subse-<lb/>quent crystallographic analysis provided us with the <lb/>opportunity to analyze the structure with regard to <lb/>substrate binding and oxygen reactivity. The latter <lb/>issue is especially interesting as the control of oxygen <lb/>reactivity in flavoenzymes is still a controversial topic. <lb/>The direct comparison of a dehydrogenase <lb/>(hDMGDH) and an oxidase (AgDMGO) allowed new <lb/>insights into the structural elements involved in oxygen <lb/>reactivity and supports concepts that are based on <lb/>gatekeeper residues in the vicinity of the isoalloxazine <lb/>ring system. In this vein, we show that a previously <lb/>proposed model to rationalize oxygen reactivity in the <lb/>vanillyl oxidase family is applicable to the family of <lb/>sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenases and oxi-<lb/>dases, respectively [25,26]. <lb/>Results <lb/>Enzyme expression and purification <lb/>Initial attempts to express the gene encoding <lb/>hDMGDH in Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) yielded lar-<lb/>gely insoluble protein. On the other hand, heterologous <lb/>expression in the methanotrophic yeast Koma-<lb/>gataella phaffi (formerly known as Pichia pastoris [24]) <lb/>was successful. As shown in Fig. 2A, western blot anal-<lb/>ysis of K. phaffii cell lysates at different time points <lb/>indicates a stable expression of the protein after induc-<lb/>tion with methanol (MeOH). Typically, fermentations <lb/>were stopped after 96 h after MeOH induction result-<lb/>ing in 1.6-1.9 kg of wet cell pellet. A comparison of <lb/>signal intensities showed that the WT was expressed in <lb/>higher amounts than the variant under identical fer-<lb/>mentation conditions thus leading to a higher yield of <lb/>WT (Fig. 2A). After cell disruption and Ni-NTA affin-<lb/>ity chromatography, the yield of proteins (Fig. 2B, <lb/>lanes 3) was approximately 70 and 25 mg of the WT <lb/>and H109R variant, respectively (40 or 15 lg enzyme <lb/>per g wet cell weight). In order to achieve higher purity <lb/>for crystallization trials, the proteins were further puri-<lb/>fied using anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B, <lb/>lanes 4) resulting in lower protein yields of 30 and <lb/>2 mg (17 or 1 lg enzyme per g wet cell weight) of WT <lb/>and H109R variant, respectively. The protein loss <lb/>mainly occurred during the necessary buffer change to <lb/>lower salt concentrations after Ni-NTA affinity chro-<lb/>matography required for the subsequent anion <lb/>exchange chromatography. Although we experienced <lb/>that hDMGDH tends to precipitate at low salt concen-<lb/>trations, other chromatographic methods, like size-<lb/>exclusion chromatography or hydrophobic interaction <lb/>chromatography, were explored but did not give a <lb/>similar purity. <lb/>The A 280 /A 450 ratios of the highly pure protein frac-<lb/>tions were usually between 14-16 and 20-25 for the <lb/>WT and variant protein, respectively. The UV-Vis <lb/>absorption spectra show a clear difference between <lb/>enzyme-bound FAD and free FAD (Fig. 2C), whereas <lb/>hDMGDH-WT and the variant featured similar spec-<lb/>tral properties with identical absorption maxima. In <lb/>comparison with free FAD in solution, the UV-Vis <lb/>absorption maxima of FAD bound to either WT or <lb/>the H109R variant exhibit a hypsochromic shift from <lb/>370 to 350 nm and a bathochromic shift from 445 to <lb/>460 nm (Fig. 2C). <lb/>Determination of kinetic parameters for <lb/>hDMGDH-WT and H109R variant <lb/>The evaluation of the steady-state kinetic parameters <lb/>for hDMGDH-WT and H109R variant was conducted <lb/>using either ferrocene or 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol <lb/>(DCPIP) as electron acceptor to oxidize the reduced <lb/>FAD cofactor. The obtained parameters show signifi-<lb/>cant differences between the two assay systems both in <lb/>terms of the k cat as well as the K M for DMG (Fig. 3, <lb/>Table 1). When ferrocene was used as the artificial <lb/>electron acceptor the k cat was fivefold greater than <lb/>with DCPIP (213 AE 4 versus 44 AE 1 min À1 , Table 1) <lb/>and the K M was significantly higher (1.4 AE 0.1 versus <lb/>0.3 AE 0.002 mM, Table 1). Interestingly, the H109R <lb/>variant exhibited a twofold higher activity than the <lb/>WT in both assays. At the same time, the K M of <lb/>DMG was strongly increased by a factor of 23 and 16 <lb/>in the ferrocene and DCPIP assay, respectively, result-<lb/>ing in an approximately 10-fold lower catalytic effi-<lb/>ciency of the H109R variant (Table 1). Notably, when <lb/>DCPIP was used as electron acceptor, data lineariza-<lb/>tion using the method of Eadie and Hofstee revealed a <lb/>second, much higher K M value of % 30 mM for DMG <lb/>(inset Fig. 3A). As the rate at which FAD is oxidized <lb/>by ferrocene is closer to the rate of flavin reduction, it <lb/>appears that ferrocene is superior to DCPIP as elec-<lb/>tron acceptor. <lb/></body>

			<body>Due to much lower enzyme amounts available of <lb/>the H109R variant, presteady-state kinetics were solely <lb/>measured with the wild-type enzyme.

Thus, the <lb/>reductive rate is 5-20 times faster than k cat determined <lb/>in the ferrocene and DCPIP (Table 1) indicating that <lb/>the electron transfer from the reduced FAD to the <lb/>artificial electron acceptor is rate-limiting in the assays <lb/>used to evaluate steady-state kinetics.

Rapid reaction measurements <lb/>with sarcosine yielded a limiting rate of reduction of <lb/>0.7 AE 0.1 s À1 and a dissociation constant of <lb/>280 AE 10 mM clearly indicating that sarcosine is a <lb/>much poorer substrate than DMG (Fig. 4A). <lb/>Finally, we also studied the effect of THF on the <lb/>activity of hDMGDH using the ferrocene assay <lb/>(Fig. 5). The activity measurements were done simi-<lb/>larly to the ferrocene activity assay as described above <lb/>at 25°C and pH 7.8 in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH with <lb/>150 mM NaCl, 100 nM hDMGDH, 1 mM DMG, <lb/>0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM freshly prepared ferrocene <lb/>in a concentration range of 0-75 lM THF.

In contrast to substrate reduction, photore-<lb/>duction of hDMGDH leads to the anionic (red) fla-<lb/>vin semiquinone with a typical absorption maximum <lb/>at 372 nm (Fig. 6A). Further photoreduction eventu-<lb/>ally leads to the fully reduced dihydroquinone <lb/>(Fig. 6B), which is directly converted to the oxidized <lb/>state without the occurrence of a semiquinone upon <lb/>reaction with molecular dioxygen (Fig. 6C). This was <lb/>also seen when reduced hDMGDH was reacted with <lb/>air-saturated buffer in the stopped flow device (data <lb/>not shown). <lb/>In order to determine the redox potential of <lb/>hDMGDH, we employed the xanthine oxidase/xan-<lb/>thine method described by Massey [27] using indigo-<lb/>trisulfonic acid potassium salt as reference dye.

			<body>cofactor is covalently attached to the protein through <lb/>a linkage between N3 of His91 and the 8a-methyl <lb/>group of the isoalloxazine moiety as confirmed by <lb/>the crystal structure. The folate-binding domain can <lb/>be divided into three subdomains positioned in a <lb/>&apos;cloverleaf&apos;-like arrangement as previously described <lb/>for the rat enzyme [18]. Subdomain 1 (residues 467-<lb/>537 and 626-728) contains a Greek-key motif sur-<lb/>rounded by a-helices. Subdomain 2 (residues 538-625 <lb/>and 729-770) is defined by a five-stranded antiparal-<lb/>lel b-sheet with flanking a-helices. Subdomain 3 (resi-<lb/>dues 771-850) adopts a jellyroll fold. The structure <lb/>of the rDMGDH was determined in complex with <lb/>THF [18]. We also observed some difference electron <lb/>density in the same area in the folate-binding <lb/>domain. Due to the lower resolution of the diffrac-<lb/>tion data and/or an incomplete occupancy of the <lb/>ligand, however, this density was not clear enough to <lb/>unequivocally position a folate molecule. Based on <lb/>the structural similarity of the two enzymes, it is still <lb/>very likely that folate binds in the same position <lb/>(Fig. 8B). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Heterologous enzyme expression and purification <lb/>In this study, we demonstrated that intracellular <lb/>expression of hDMGDH in K. phaffii is feasible and <lb/>provides enough hDMGDH to perform a detailed <lb/>biochemical and structural characterization. The <lb/>expression of the full-length protein and a D50 trun-<lb/>cated version as well as secretory expression were <lb/>unsuccessful. However, an N-terminal D28 truncation <lb/>of the enzyme was expressed successfully representing <lb/>the mature form of the enzyme lacking its mitochon-<lb/>drial targeting sequence [28]. The intracellular <lb/>coexpression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein <lb/>disulfide isomerase enzyme resulted in improved pro-<lb/>tein yields. The expression of hDMGDH in E. coli as <lb/>reported before [19] was unsuccessful and failed to <lb/>yield detectable amounts of protein as judged by <lb/>western blotting. A C-terminal nona-histidine-tag was <lb/>added to the gene in order to facilitate purification <lb/>by means of affinity chromatography. According to <lb/>the previously published structure of the rat enzyme <lb/>[18], this C-terminal tag should not interfere with the <lb/>native fold of the protein or catalytic activity. Wes-<lb/>tern blot analysis showed that the H109R variant is <lb/>expressed in lower amounts compared to the WT <lb/>(Fig. 2A). <lb/>A theoretical A 280 /A 450 ratio for hDMGDH fully <lb/>saturated with FAD cofactor can be roughly calcu-<lb/>lated to 14. The observed A 280 /A 450 ratios of the <lb/>highly pure proteins, 14-16 and 20-24 for WT and <lb/>H109R variant, respectively, revealed that the WT is <lb/>almost fully loaded with the covalently attached <lb/>FAD. In the case of the variant, the ratio was much <lb/>higher indicating a much lower saturation compared <lb/>to the WT (ca. 40-50% apoprotein), similar to <lb/>previously reported observations [19]. The higher <lb/>fraction of apoprotein may be responsible for the <lb/>recurring protein precipitation during purification of <lb/>the variant. Overall, this led to substantially reduced <lb/>yields of the variant protein and limited the scope of <lb/>experiments that could be conducted. <lb/>Spectral characteristics and steady-state kinetics <lb/>of hDMGDH <lb/>Recombinant hDMGDH features characteristic UV-<lb/>Vis absorption properties that clearly distinguish the <lb/>bound FAD from FAD free in solution (Fig. 2C). <lb/>These spectral characteristics are very similar to those <lb/>Fig. 8.

			<body>reported earlier for DMGDH isolated from rat and <lb/>pig liver as well as for recombinant AgDMGO <lb/>[8,16,20]. In contrast, the UV-Vis absorption spectra <lb/>for heterologously expressed rat DMGDH [17] and <lb/>human DMGDH [19] are either of very poor quality <lb/>or apparently lack the spectral features that are typi-<lb/>cally found in these enzymes. In fact, the only pub-<lb/>lished spectrum of hDMGDH expressed in E. coli is <lb/>very similar to free FAD in solution (compare spectra <lb/>shown in Fig. 9). <lb/>A summary of our data and the previously pub-<lb/>lished kinetic steady-state data is given in Table 3. <lb/>These values were obtained using two different enzy-<lb/>matic activity assays, on one hand with ferrocenium <lb/>hexafluorophosphate as electron acceptor and on the <lb/>other hand, the combination of phenazine methosul-<lb/>fate (PMS) as electron mediator and DCPIP as termi-<lb/>nal electron acceptor. Both assays are physiologically <lb/>irrelevant as all mammalian DMGDHs interact with <lb/>the electron-transferring flavoprotein (hETF) for reoxi-<lb/>dation of the reduced cofactor. With the ferrocene <lb/>assay, we have obtained comparable results as <lb/>reported for the rat enzyme [18] and also for the bacte-<lb/>rial DMGO [22]. However, analysis of the data <lb/>obtained with the PMS/DCPIP yielded two Michaelis-<lb/>Menten constants similar to previously published data <lb/>for the rat enzyme [16,17]. Interestingly, aside from the <lb/>results reported by McAndrew et al. [19], two K M val-<lb/>ues were only observed for the two component DCPIP <lb/>activity assay, with PMS as electron mediator, but not <lb/>in the one component ferrocene or H 2 O 2 assay sug-<lb/>gesting that it is an experimental artifact. In view of <lb/>this apparent inconsistency, speculations that the pres-<lb/>ence of two K M values reflect the presence of activat-<lb/>ing or regulatory sites in the enzyme are unwarranted <lb/>[16,17]. Moreover, we have shown that the rate of <lb/>enzyme reduction is faster than k cat indicating that <lb/>reoxidation is rate-limiting for turnover in both assays. <lb/>Thus, the affinity of DMG to hDMGDH is more reli-<lb/>ably expressed as the dissociation constant determined <lb/>in presteady-state experiments. <lb/>Effects of a naturally occurring H109R enzyme <lb/>variation <lb/>The rare naturally occurring enzyme variant H109R <lb/>causes a nonfatal disease called dimethylglycine dehy-<lb/>drogenase deficiency (OMIM: 605850). The defect <lb/>results in an accumulation of DMG in blood serum <lb/>and urine, and patients suffer from a mild phenotype <lb/>including muscle fatigue and fish-like odor [9,10]. <lb/>During heterologous expression in K. phaffii, we <lb/>noticed decreased expression levels resulting in much <lb/>lower yields of the variant protein. Further character-<lb/>ization of the variant protein demonstrated lower <lb/>cofactor saturation and thermal stability. Interest-<lb/>ingly, the variant showed elevated turnover rates in <lb/>both of our assay systems although K M values were <lb/>15-25 times higher and the catalytic efficiency 10-fold <lb/>lower than for the WT (Table 1). Hence, our results <lb/>are clearly in contradiction with previously published <lb/>data [19] that claimed significantly decreased catalytic <lb/>activity of the H109R variant. As the spectral prop-<lb/>erties of DMGDH preparations obtained from the <lb/>E. coli expression system lacks the characteristic fea-<lb/>tures typically observed for DMGDH isolated from <lb/>natural sources (e.g., rat and pig liver), it is conceiv-<lb/>able that recombinant DMGDH generated in bacte-<lb/>rial host cells suffers from an altered FAD-binding <lb/>mode, such as noncovalent binding. In fact, the <lb/>absorption spectrum reported for wild-type DMGDH <lb/>and its H109R variant is clearly more similar to that <lb/>of free FAD (Fig. 9). In our hands, the bacterial <lb/>expression system produced solely insoluble protein <lb/>and therefore analysis of FAD binding to the protein <lb/>could not be inspected further. <lb/>Previous reports on the structure of bacterial <lb/>DMGO and rat DMGDH identified a large internal <lb/>cavity in the protein [6,18]. This cavity serves as &apos;reac-<lb/>tion chamber&apos; responsible for substrate delivery to the <lb/>active site, substrate conversion, as well as intermedi-<lb/>ate channeling to THF and product formation. The <lb/>binding site of THF is the only entry-exit point of the <lb/>protein, which was revealed by MD simulations for <lb/>the structurally related DMGO [6] and also confirmed <lb/>by cavity analysis of our structure (Fig. 10A). In <lb/>accordance with this interpretation, increasing THF <lb/>concentrations exhibited a negative effect on the <lb/>Fig. 9. Protein spectrum of this study (black line) compared with <lb/>the published hDMGDH spectrum (gray line, [19]) and free FAD in <lb/>solution (dotted blue line). The published spectrum resembles free <lb/>FAD in solution and not our spectral findings. <lb/></body>

			<body>turnover rate (Fig. 5) as the substrate DMG competes <lb/>with THF for entrance into the cavity at the THF-<lb/>binding site. <lb/>The consistently (16-to 23-fold) higher K M <lb/>observed in both steady-state assays with the variant <lb/>suggests that replacement of histidine by the bulkier <lb/>arginine impedes access of DMG to the binding site <lb/>(Fig. 10B). On the other hand, the H109R variant <lb/>possessed higher k cat values indicating that the vari-<lb/>ant is more permissible in transferring electrons from <lb/>the reduced FAD to the artificial electron acceptors. <lb/>In conclusion, our analysis of the disease-related <lb/>H109R variant has revealed a lower thermal stability <lb/>and an approximately 10-fold lower catalytic efficiency <lb/>(Table 1) as major effects of the single amino acid <lb/>exchange. The diminished protein expression and <lb/>cofactor saturation found in our expression system <lb/>may also be relevant for homologous expression of the <lb/>variant in human cells and thus contribute to the over-<lb/>all reduced DMGDH activity manifested in affected <lb/>human subjects. <lb/>Substrate specificity, redox behavior, and active <lb/>site composition <lb/>The overall protein structure and the active site of <lb/>hDMGDH with the covalently bound FAD as well as <lb/>the THF-binding site are very similar to the rat <lb/>enzyme (PDB ID: 4PAA; [18]), and the structure of <lb/>AgDMGO [21]. In 2003, AgDMGO could be crystal-<lb/>lized with a bound folic acid (PDB ID: 1PJ6) but addi-<lb/>tionally also with a bound acetate ion that mimics the <lb/>negatively charged carboxylate group of DMG (PDB <lb/>ID: 1PJ5). Most residues in the active site of <lb/>AgDMGO described to play a role in catalysis and <lb/>substrate binding are also present in hDMGDH <lb/>(Fig. 11). Docking of DMG and sarcosine to the <lb/>active site of the hDMGDH structure results in a simi-<lb/>lar positioning of both substrates (Fig. 11A,B) and <lb/>thus do not rationalize the differences observed in <lb/>affinity and catalytic activity. This binding mode is <lb/>similar to the acetate moiety in the crystal structure of <lb/>DMGO (Fig. 11C).

			<body>comparing DMG and sarcosine as substrate for <lb/>hDMGDH-WT show a 25-fold decrease of the reduc-<lb/>tive rate for sarcosine as the substrate and a more than <lb/>50-fold higher K D . These results are in very good <lb/>agreement with data obtained for the bacterial DMGO <lb/>(Table 4) [22]. Therefore, sarcosine is a poor but possi-<lb/>bly physiologically relevant substrate for the enzyme <lb/>as already shown previously for the pig enzyme [3] <lb/>and AgDMGO [22]. On the other hand, sarcosine is <lb/>apparently oxidized by a homologous sarcosine dehy-<lb/>drogenase (SARDH) [16] and also by peroxisomal sar-<lb/>cosine oxidase (PIPOX) [29]. Therefore, the relative <lb/>turnover of sarcosine by these three FAD-dependent <lb/>enzymes must await further studies. <lb/>In the bacterial enzyme, a catalytic dyad, consisting of <lb/>a histidine and a tyrosine, is responsible for deprotona-<lb/>tion of the substrate amine [21]. This catalytic dyad is <lb/>also present in the human enzyme (Fig. 11). Further-<lb/>more, residues interacting with DMG (and sarcosine) <lb/>were identified in the structure of hDMGDH (Fig. 11A). <lb/>After binding and conversion of the substrate at the <lb/>active site, an intermediate, most likely a cyclic lactone is <lb/>channeled through the protein cavity to the THF-bind-<lb/>ing site [6]. The THF-binding sites of mammalian and <lb/>bacterial enzymes are again very similar and were <lb/>already extensively discussed by Luka et al. [18]. <lb/>Basran et al. reported a multistep kinetic model for <lb/>the reduction of DMGO by DMG. In contrast, the <lb/>reduction of hDMGDH by DMG was adequately fit <lb/>by a single exponential equation. The actual measure-<lb/>ment of the intermediate cyclic lactone could not be <lb/>observed, most likely due to its short lifetime as <lb/>described elsewhere [6]. <lb/>The two dehydrogenases in choline degradation <lb/>belong to a family of enzymes that delivers electrons to <lb/>the electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF). Among <lb/>these clients, only the redox potential for the two-elec-<lb/>tron reduction of human medium-chain acyl-CoA <lb/>dehydrogenases (hMCAD) was previously determined <lb/>[30,31]. This prompted us to determine the redox <lb/>potential for the covalently bound FAD in hDMGDH. <lb/>The obtained value of À93 AE mV is 40 mV more <lb/>positive than that of hMCAD (À135 mV [30,31]) in <lb/>agreement with the fact that covalent linkages to the 8-<lb/>methyl group increase the redox potential [32]. In any <lb/>case, the much higher redox potential of hETF <lb/>(+37 mV for the oxidized/semiquinone couple, [33]) <lb/>ensures that electrons from hDMGDH are readily <lb/>transferred to the ETF-bound FAD. <lb/>The rates of reduction determined for hDMGDH <lb/>are in good agreement with those observed for bacte-<lb/>rial DMGO (Table 4). In contrast to that, the oxygen <lb/>reactivity of reduced hDMGDH is more than 300 <lb/>times lower and apparently physiologically irrelevant <lb/>as reoxidation by its cognate partner protein hETF <lb/>proceeds over 30 times faster (P. Augustin, E. Gerst-<lb/>mann and P. Macheroux, unpublished results). <lb/>Recently, a study concerning steric control of dioxy-<lb/>gen reduction in enzymes of the vanillyl-alcohol oxi-<lb/>dase (VAO) family discovered a new &apos;gatekeeper&apos; <lb/>residue in berberine bridge enzyme and the pollen <lb/>allergen Phl p 4 [25]. This gatekeeper appears to con-<lb/>trol access to an oxyanion hole essential to stabilize <lb/>reaction intermediates during oxidation of the reduced <lb/>isoalloxazine ring by dioxygen. In this family, valine <lb/>was found to grant access to the oxyanion hole, <lb/>whereas isoleucine denies access [25]. Similarly, Lefer-<lb/>ink et al. discovered that a large number of oxidases <lb/>in the VAO family contain either a glycine or a proline <lb/>at a structurally conserved position near the isoalloxa-<lb/>Fig. 11.

Although hDMGDH does not belong to <lb/>the VAO protein superfamily, comparison of the <lb/>hDMGDH to the AgDMGO structure reveals that <lb/>hDMGDH features residues typical for dehydroge-<lb/>nases suppressing oxygen reactivity, i.e., an alanine <lb/>and isoleucine, whereas AgDMGO possesses residues <lb/>compatible with high oxygen reactivity, i.e., proline <lb/>and valine (Fig. 12).

			<body>terminal nona-histidine tag were added. The designed gene <lb/>was cloned into a pPICZ B expression vector (Thermo <lb/>Fisher Scientific) and verified by automated sequencing. <lb/>The recombinant plasmid was transformed to K. phaffii <lb/>KM71H strain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), harboring a <lb/>pPICK-PDI vector containing the gene for the protein <lb/>disulfide isomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae following <lb/>the guidelines of the Invitrogen EasySelect TM Pichia Expres-<lb/>sion Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Positive clones were <lb/>selected by Zeocin resistance and verified by western blot. <lb/>The H109R variant was constructed by a two-step site-<lb/>directed mutagenesis method employing Phusion DNA <lb/>polymerase and 5 0 -AACTTGAAGAAGATCAGATACG <lb/>ACTCCATCAAG-3 0 as forward and 5 0 -CTTGATGGAG <lb/>TCGTATCTGATCTTCTTCAAGTT-3 0 as reverse primer <lb/>(alternated codon underlined). For the first reaction step, <lb/>two separate PCR reactions using either the forward or the <lb/>reverse primer were run with the PCR program: 98°C <lb/>(2 min) -[98°C (50 s) -60°C (20 s) -68°C <lb/>(16.5 min)] 9 5 -4°C ∞. Afterwards, the two PCR reac-<lb/>tions were combined and the same program was employed <lb/>for another 20 cycles. Then, after a 2-h DpnI digestion step, <lb/>the plasmid was transformed to Escherichia coli TOP10 <lb/>cells for amplification before transformation to K. phaffii <lb/>KM71H [pPICK-PDI]. Strain selection was done as <lb/>described above. <lb/>Enzyme expression <lb/>hDMGDH and hDMGDH-H109R expression was carried <lb/>out in a 7-L glass fermenter BBI CT5-2 system (Sartorius, <lb/>G€ ottingen, Germany). Preparation of inoculum, and prepa-<lb/>ration of the fermenter, batch, and fed-batch were carried <lb/>out as described by Schrittwieser et al. [34]. The fermenta-<lb/>tion medium was a minimal basal salt medium (MgSO • <lb/>7 H 2 O -1.2 gÁL À1 ; K 2 SO 4 -14.9 gÁL À1 ; KOH -<lb/>18.2 gÁL À1 ; NaCl -4.13 gÁL À1 ; glycerol -40 gÁL À1 ; 85% <lb/>H 3 PO 4 -27 mLÁL À1 ). After the fed-batch, the MeOH <lb/>induction was started by injection of 5 g MeOH directly <lb/>into the fermenter and afterwards by a stepwise increase in <lb/>MeOH feed from 0 to 6 gÁh À1 over 2 h. Glycerol feed was <lb/>reduced from 15 to 6 gÁh À1 over 2 h and a mixed MeOH/ <lb/>glycerol feed was maintained until the end of the fermenta-<lb/>tion. In total, 400-500 g MeOH was fed to the cultures <lb/>before harvest after 96 h of induced growth. Samples were <lb/>taken for western blot analysis at different time points. The <lb/>cell pellet was collected by centrifugation (2704 g, 30 min, <lb/>4°C) and stored at À20°C. <lb/>Enzyme purification <lb/>Cell lysates were prepared by Merckenschlager (Braun Bio-<lb/>tech International, Melsungen, Germany) glass beads cell <lb/>homogenization under CO 2 cooling (3-min disruption <lb/>steps). For every 1 g harvested wet cell pellet, 2-mL cell <lb/>lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 35 mM <lb/>imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.8) and a spatula tip of FAD <lb/>were added before cell disruption. The lysates were cleared <lb/>by centrifugation (38 720 g, 30 min, 4°C) and filtered <lb/>through a paper filter. Nickel ion affinity chromatography <lb/>was done by applying the lysates onto self-packed nickel-<lb/>Sepharose 6 Fast Flow columns (GE Healthcare) at 4°C. <lb/>Afterwards, the material was washed with washing buffer <lb/>(50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 75 mM imidazole, <lb/>pH 7.8) and the enzyme stripped with elution buffer <lb/>(50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, <lb/>pH 7.8). The purification was monitored by SDS/PAGE <lb/>and fractions containing hDMGDH were concentrated and <lb/>rebuffered to storage buffer (50 mM HEPES/NaOH, <lb/>150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter <lb/>units (50 kDa cut-off; Merck-Milipore, Darmstadt, Ger-<lb/>many). The obtained enzyme purity was sufficient for <lb/>kinetic and photometric studies of the enzymes. If a higher <lb/>enzyme purity was needed, especially for protein crystalliza-<lb/>tion, the eluted fractions of the affinity chromatography <lb/>were rebuffered to buffer A (25 mM HEPES/NaOH, 25 mM <lb/>NaCl, pH 7.8), and anion exchange chromatography with a <lb/>MonoQ 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare) was done on an <lb/>€ <lb/>AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) at 4°C. The protein <lb/>was eluted with a gradient from 0% to 50% buffer B <lb/>(25 mM HEPES/NaOH, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.8). The chro-<lb/>matography was controlled by SDS/PAGE and fractions <lb/>containing hDMGDH were concentrated and rebuffered to <lb/>storage buffer as described above. Purification was done <lb/>identically for the wild-type and the variant enzyme. <lb/>SDS/PAGE <lb/>Enzyme samples were separated by SDS/PAGE, with <lb/>12.5% separation gels (for western blot 10%), under reduc-<lb/>ing conditions as described by Laemmli [35]. Gels were <lb/>either used for western blot analysis or stained with Coo-<lb/>massie brilliant blue R-250 for purification control. As pro-<lb/>tein standard, a PageRuler Prestained protein ladder <lb/>(Thermo Fisher Scientific) was employed. <lb/>Western blot <lb/>K. phaffii cell lysates for western blot screening and control <lb/>of fermentation were prepared by glass bead disruption fol-<lb/>lowing the Invitrogen EasySelect TM Pichia Expression Kit <lb/>manual (p. 42, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot <lb/>analysis was done on nitrocellulose membranes essentially <lb/>following the General Protocol for western blotting from <lb/>Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA; Bulletin 6376). As anti-<lb/>bodies, a rabbit anti-histidine IgG antibody at 1 : 2000 <lb/>overnight at 4°C as primary and an HRP-linked goat <lb/>anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1 : 5000 for 1 h at room <lb/>temperature as secondary antibody were used. As loading <lb/>control, a rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody was used in a <lb/></body>

			<body>1 : 1000 dilution overnight. Immunoreactive signals were <lb/>obtained using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent <lb/>Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and detection in a <lb/>G:BOX (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). <lb/>UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy <lb/>UV-Vis absorption spectra to assess protein concentration, <lb/>activity, purity, quality, and cofactor saturation, as well as <lb/>for steady-state kinetic measurements and photoreduction <lb/>were recorded with a Specord 210 spectrophotometer <lb/>(Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). <lb/>Enzyme quantification and calculation of the <lb/>extinction coefficient <lb/>Protein concentrations of purified hDMGDH enzymes were <lb/>determined according to the characteristic absorption of <lb/>bound FAD at 450 nm. The molar extinction coefficient <lb/>for hDMGDH was calculated using the method described <lb/>by Macheroux [36] to 11 600 M À1 Ácm À1 . <lb/>Steady-state kinetics <lb/>Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using <lb/>DCPIP according to Okamura-Ikeda et al. [37] or ferroce-<lb/>nium hexafluorophosphate (Fc + PF À <lb/>6 ) as described by <lb/>Lehman et al. [38] as terminal electron acceptor and mea-<lb/>surable dimension in the spectrophotometer. In short, <lb/>DCPIP assays were performed at 25°C and pH 7.8 in <lb/>50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 135 lM DCPIP, and <lb/>100 nM hDMGDH with freshly prepared 3 mM phenazine <lb/>methosulfate (PMS) as intermediate electron mediator and <lb/>0-100 mM dimethylglycine (DMG) following the change of <lb/>absorption spectrophotometrically at 600 nm over 3 min. <lb/>Ferrocenium assays were performed at 25°C at pH 7.8 in <lb/>50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, <lb/>100 nM hDMGDH, 0-100 mM DMG, and freshly prepared <lb/>0.2 mM Fc + PF À <lb/>6 following the change of absorption at <lb/>300 nm over 3 min. For each concentration, at least a trip-<lb/>licate measurement was performed, the initial velocities <lb/>were determined, and K M and k cat were assessed by nonlin-<lb/>ear hyperbolic fit in ORIGIN 8.6 (OriginLab Corp., <lb/>Northampton, MA, USA). <lb/>Presteady-state kinetics <lb/>Presteady-state reaction kinetics were measured anaerobi-<lb/>cally with a Hi-Tech stopped flow instrument (SF-61DX2; <lb/>TgK Scientific Limited, Bradford-on-Avon, UK) in a glove <lb/>box (Belle Technology, Weymouth, UK) at 25°C. For <lb/>determination of the reductive rates of enzyme-bound <lb/>FAD, 20 lM purified hDMGDH in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH, <lb/>pH 7.8 containing 150 mM NaCl was shot against different <lb/>concentrations of DMG (0.25-250 mM) or sarcosine <lb/>(0-500 mM) dissolved in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH, mM <lb/>NaCl pH 7.8 and monitored at 460 nm with a Kineta-<lb/>ScanT diode array detector (MG-6560; TgK Scientific Lim-<lb/>ited). Each concentration was measured in triplicates and <lb/>the observed rate constants (k obs ) for different substrate <lb/>concentrations were calculated using an exponential fitting <lb/>function in the KINETIC STUDIO software (TgK Scientific <lb/>Limited). The dissociation constant (K D ) was determined <lb/>by a hyperbolic fitting curve employing ORIGIN 8.6 <lb/>(OriginLab Corp.). The oxidative rate (k ox ) of the enzyme <lb/>was measured three times at an oxygen concentration of <lb/>10.5% O 2 (135 lM O 2 ), by mixing substrate-reduced <lb/>hDMGDH with air equilibrated buffer (50 mM HEPES/ <lb/>NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). <lb/>Determination of the redox potential <lb/>The redox potential (E 0 ) of the enzyme-bound FAD was <lb/>measured by the dye-equilibration method using the xan-<lb/>thine/xanthine oxidase system as described by Massey [27]. <lb/>The concentrations of enzyme and redox dye were chosen <lb/>in a way that their absorption maxima were in the same <lb/>range. The reactions were performed with a Hi-Tech <lb/>stopped flow device (SF-61DX2; TgK Scientific Limited). <lb/>The measurements took place under anaerobic conditions <lb/>in a glove box (Belle Technology) at 25°C in 50 mM <lb/>HEPES/NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The simultaneous <lb/>reduction of FAD and the redox dye was monitored with <lb/>a KinetaScanT diode array detector (MG-6560; TgK <lb/>Scientific Limited). The reaction was started by mixing a <lb/>solution containing 300 lM xanthine, 5 lM benzyl violo-<lb/>gen, and an appropriate amount of enzyme with a solu-<lb/>tion containing catalytic amounts of xanthine oxidase <lb/>(approximately 200 nM, from bovine milk, Grade III pur-<lb/>ity; Sigma-Aldrich) and the redox dye indigotrisulfonic <lb/>acid dipotassium salt (E 0 , pH 7.0, 25°C = À81 mV). The <lb/>redox potential was calculated using double logarithmic <lb/>plots, log(ox/red) of the enzyme versus log(ox/red) of the <lb/>dye, according to Minnaert [39]. A linear least-squares fit <lb/>was done with Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, <lb/>USA). <lb/>Anaerobic photoreduction and reoxidation <lb/>Photoreduction of hDMGDH was done according to the <lb/>procedure reported by Massey and Hemmerich [40]. About <lb/>lM purified enzyme sample in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH, <lb/>pH 7.8 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 lM <lb/>5-diaza-FMN, and 2 lM methyl viologen were rendered <lb/>anaerobic by 2-h incubation in sealable quartz cuvettes in a <lb/>glove box (Belle Technology). Photoirradiation was carried <lb/>out with a 10 W LED flood light (Luminea, Buggingen, <lb/>Germany) and cooling of the cuvette to 15°C. Spectra <lb/>were recorded until no further changes were observed. For <lb/>reoxidation of the enzyme, the cuvettes were exposed to air <lb/></body>

			<body>oxygen and absorption spectra were recorded until no <lb/>further changes were observed. <lb/>Temperature stability <lb/>Thermofluor ® <lb/>The temperature stability of the enzymes was assessed by <lb/>monitoring the change in fluorescence using the solva-<lb/>tochromic dye SYPRO Orange (Sigma-Aldrich) in a Ther-<lb/>mofluor Ò assay. Thermofluor Ò measurements were carried <lb/>out as reviewed elsewhere [41] in an FX Connect real-time <lb/>PCR system (Bio-Rad) in 25 lL of 50 mM HEPES/NaOH, <lb/>pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 lM of enzyme, and <lb/>2.5 lL of a 5009 dilution of a SYPRO Orange Enzyme <lb/>Gel stain. The samples were preheated to 25°C and then <lb/>the temperature was increased in 0.5°CÁmin À1 steps to <lb/>95°C. Fluorescence data were collected using the FRET <lb/>channel. Melting temperatures (T m ) were determined using <lb/>CFX MANAGER 3.0 software (Bio-Rad). <lb/>Circular dichroism spectroscopy <lb/>CD spectra were recorded on a PS-150J spectropolarimeter <lb/>(Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany) using a 0.02 cm water-<lb/>jacketed cylindrical cell thermostatically controlled by an <lb/>external computer-controlled water bath (Julabo F25, Seel-<lb/>bach, Germany). Thermal denaturation data were recorded <lb/>in a temperature range from 25 to 95°C with a heating <lb/>rate of 1°CÁmin À1 , a response of 1 s, and a resolution of <lb/>0.1°C. The protein concentration used was approximately <lb/>6 lM in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.8. The <lb/>melting temperature was estimated as the point of inflection <lb/>of the temperature-dependent mean residue ellipticity at <lb/>208 nm. <lb/>Crystallization of hDMGDH <lb/>Crystallization experiments were performed with the micro-<lb/>batch method using different commercial crystallization <lb/>screens [Index and Morpheus Screen from Hampton <lb/>Research (Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) and Molecular Dimen-<lb/>sions (Newmarket, UK), respectively]. Drops were prepared <lb/>by mixing 0.5 lL of the protein solution (at a concentra-<lb/>tion of 4 mgÁmL À1 in 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaCl, and <lb/>2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) with an equal volume of mother liquor <lb/>using an ORYX 8 pipetting robot (Douglas Instruments, <lb/>Hungerford, UK). The drops were sealed with a 3 : 1 mix-<lb/>ture of paraffin and silicon oil and the trays incubated at <lb/>20°C. First crystal clusters were observed after approxi-<lb/>mately 1 month in various conditions. Further optimization <lb/>involved dilutions of the original condition using 25 mM <lb/>HEPES, 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5. Diffracting <lb/>hDMGDH crystals were obtained with a 1 : 3 dilution of <lb/>the original condition H5 of the Morpheus Screen consist-<lb/>ing of 10% w/v PEG 20000, 20% v/v PEG MME 550, <lb/>0.02 M of each amino acid, and 0.1 M MOPS/HEPES-Na <lb/>pH 7.5. <lb/>Data collection and processing <lb/>X-ray diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolu-<lb/>tion of 3.1 <lb/>A on beam line ID29 (k = 0.972 <lb/>A) at the <lb/>ESRF Grenoble, France. The crystals were monoclinic <lb/>(space group P2 1 ) with unit-cell parameters a = 83.38 <lb/>A, <lb/>b = 119.87 <lb/>A, c = 86.47 <lb/>A, and b = 92.6°. The data were <lb/>processed using the XDS package [42] and the structure was <lb/>solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the <lb/>rat dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 4PAA, 90% <lb/>sequence identity) [18]. Structure rebuilding and refinement <lb/>were performed using the programs COOT [43] and PHENIX <lb/>[44]. The model contained one B-factor per amino acid resi-<lb/>due. Noncrystallographic-symmetry (NCS) restraints were <lb/>applied. A small number of water molecules were added <lb/>only manually into the most significant electron difference <lb/>electron density peaks before the last cycle of refinement. <lb/>Clear electron density was observed for the majority of the <lb/>amino acids except of the first 18 N-terminal residues and <lb/>the 13 C-terminal residues in both chains present in the <lb/>asymmetric unit. Residual density was interpreted as FAD <lb/>in both chains. The final structure was validated using MOL-<lb/>PROBITY [45]. Detailed statistics pertaining to data process-<lb/>ing and structure refinement are summarized in Table 2. <lb/>The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been <lb/>deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession <lb/>number 5L46. <lb/>In silico procedures <lb/>Figures for structural analyses were prepared using PYMOL <lb/>(DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, USA [46]). In silico <lb/>mutagenesis of hDMGDH residue H109 to R109 in the <lb/>crystal structure was performed with the mutagenesis wiz-<lb/>ard of PYMOL (DeLano Scientific) and subsequent energy <lb/>minimization using YASARA (Yasara Biosciences, Vienna, <lb/>Austria). Docking experiments of DMG and sarcosine into <lb/>the hDMGDH structure was done using AUTODOCK/VINA <lb/>[47] as implemented in YASARA. Cavity analyses after and <lb/>before mutagenesis were performed with the LIGSITE <lb/>algorithm (CASoX plugin of PYMOL, [48]). <lb/></body>
