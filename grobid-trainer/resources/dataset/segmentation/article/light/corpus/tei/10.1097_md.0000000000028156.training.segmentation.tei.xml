However, these 2 factors that affect colorectal neoplasm remain controversial. We <lb/>aimed to carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate the study population diabetes prevalence rate and H pylori infection rate with colorectal <lb/>adenoma risk for adults. <lb/>Methods: We conducted systemic research through English databases for medical reports. We also recorded the diabetes <lb/>prevalence and H pylori infection prevalence in each study. We classified these studies into 4 subgroups as their background <lb/>population diabetes prevalence &lt;6% (Group 1); between 6% and 8% (Group 2); between 8% and 10% (Group 3), and more than <lb/>10% (Group 4). The random-effects model had used to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI). <lb/>Results: Twenty-seven studies were finally eligible for meta-analysis. The random-effects model of the meta-analysis was chosen, <lb/>showing pooled odds ratio (OR) equal to 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.63). The subgroup meta-analyses showed in Group 1 the H pylori <lb/>infection associated colorectal adenoma risk OR was 1.24 (95% CI 0.86-1.78). As the diabetes rate exceed 6%, the H pylori infection <lb/>became the more significant increased risk of colorectal adenoma (Group 2: OR 2.16 (95% CI 1.61-2.91); Group 3: OR 1.40 (95% CI <lb/>1.24-1.57); and Group 4: OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.46-1.57)). <lb/>Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis showed elevated diabetes prevalence combined H pylori infection increasing the <lb/>risks of colorectal adenoma in the adult population. <lb/>Editor: Maya Saranathan. <lb/>The authors have read the PRISMA 2009 Checklist, and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the PRISMA 2009 Checklist.

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that has <lb/>infected almost 50% of the world&apos;s population. [1] Since 1994, H <lb/>pylori has been recognized as a human carcinogen by the <lb/>International Agency for Research on Cancer due to its strong <lb/>correlation with gastric cancer. [2] Except for intragastric <lb/>malignancy disease, many scientists have noted that this <lb/>bacterium is also related to colon neoplasms and colorectal <lb/>carcinoma (CRC) formation and have shown that infection with <lb/>H pylori confers a 1.3-to 1.97-fold increased risk of colon <lb/>adenoma or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia in the past 2 <lb/>decades. [3-5] However, some Asian studies did not show <lb/>consistent results. Early studies showed that H pylori infection <lb/>may have a trend of increased colon adenoma but no significant <lb/>difference. [6,7] Recent studies have demonstrated a positive <lb/>association between H pylori infection and colon adenoma <lb/>formation. [8,9] In these studies, Sonnenberg and Genta [3] <lb/>established the largest study, which included 156,000 patients, <lb/>and showed that H pylori gastritis was positively associated with <lb/>colon adenomas (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52). Even with this <lb/>impressive study result, Plummer also commented and queried <lb/>several key points. [10] The most important question that needs to <lb/>be answered is how to explain why some areas had a high <lb/>prevalence of H pylori infection but a low CRC risk. Several <lb/>meta-analysis studies have shown that H pylori infection <lb/>increases the risk of colorectal neoplasm formation. [11-13] <lb/>However, these studies did not address Plummer query. <lb/>Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) is one of the most common <lb/>metabolic disorders in the world, and the prevalence of DM has <lb/>been increasing quickly in recent decades. [14] The prevalence of <lb/>DM also has significant regional variability. According to the <lb/>latest report, the highest prevalence of DM was found in North <lb/>America and the Caribbean region, and the prevalence in this <lb/>region was approximately 11.0%. The Western Pacific region <lb/>(including Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, <lb/>and Vietnam) has a DM prevalence of approximately 8.1%. [15] <lb/>However, as socioeconomic growth and industrialization are <lb/>rapidly occurring in this area, the increasing prevalence of <lb/>diabetes was also noted in these countries. [16] DM is also <lb/>considered a risk factor for colon adenoma and carcinoma. <lb/>Several studies have shown that subjects with DM had an OR of <lb/>1.45 for colon adenoma and a relative risk of 1.38 for colorectal <lb/>adenocarcinoma. [17,18] Our previous study demonstrated that <lb/>combined hyperglycemia and H pylori infection was involved in <lb/>colon adenoma formation and had a synergistic effect. [19] The <lb/>risk of colorectal adenoma might decrease after H pylori is <lb/>successfully eradicated. [20] This means that hyperglycemia and <lb/>H pylori infection might interact and affect colorectal adenoma <lb/>formation. <lb/>Therefore, we carried out a systematic review and meta-<lb/>analysis of published studies to evaluate the association between <lb/>H pylori infection and colorectal adenoma formation. Further-<lb/>more, we surveyed the DM prevalence in each published study as <lb/>a subgroup analysis and tried to determine the relationship <lb/>between H pylori infection and DM prevalence in the risk of <lb/>colon adenoma formation. We tried to use different DM <lb/>prevalence rates to classify subgroups of these studies to answer <lb/>Plummer question and discuss the relationship between the DM <lb/>prevalence rate and H pylori infection involvement in colorectal <lb/>adenoma formation. <lb/>2. Materials and methods <lb/>2.1. Data sources and searches <lb/>Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-<lb/>analyses statement guidelines were followed for conducting and <lb/>reporting meta-analysis data. The participants, intervnetions, <lb/>comparison, outcomes, and study design scheme was followed <lb/>for reporting inclusion criteria. A systematic search was <lb/>conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the <lb/>Cochrane Library for medical reports published until the end <lb/>of August 2020 without language or date restrictions. The <lb/>following search terms were used: &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; AND <lb/>(&quot;colorectal OR &quot;colonic&quot; OR &quot;colon&quot; OR &quot;large intestine&quot;) <lb/>AND (&quot;neoplasms&quot; OR &quot;polyp&quot; OR &quot;adenoma&quot; OR &quot;cancer&quot;). <lb/>Abstracts of articles from the literature search were individually <lb/>evaluated independently for possible inclusion by the 3 authors <lb/>(CMJ, WMS, and YHW). For all databases, the last search was <lb/>run on 3 September 2020. The study protocol was registered in <lb/>PROSPERO (CRD42020199442). <lb/>2.2. Study selection <lb/>The eligible studies enrolled in the meta-analysis satisfied the <lb/>following criteria: (i) English-language abstract; (ii) full manu-<lb/>script publication; (iii) study design: clinical trials including <lb/>cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies; <lb/>(iv) reported OR estimates with corresponding 95% confidence <lb/>intervals (CIs) for the relationship between H pylori and <lb/>colorectal adenoma or provided sufficient raw data to calculate <lb/>crude ORs and 95% CIs; and (v) results: the prevalence of <lb/>patients with colorectal adenoma due to H pylori infection or the <lb/>risk of colorectal adenoma in H pylori infection. Studies were <lb/>excluded if they (i) reported duplicate results that were published <lb/>in other articles, (ii) investigated only the gastrin level or the <lb/>recurrence of colorectal neoplasia, or (iii) included a pediatric <lb/>population. <lb/>2.3. Data extraction <lb/>Three reviewers (CCC, LCJ, and SSC) independently extracted <lb/>data using a predefined form, and disagreements were resolved by <lb/>discussion and consensus. Information was collected in each <lb/>selected study as possible, concerning first author, publication <lb/>year, research type, publication type, the number of subjects, the <lb/>country of origin, the prevalence of DM rate of origin, the <lb/>matching variables, the location of neoplasia, the H pylori <lb/>detection method, the sample characteristics (age and sex), the <lb/></body>

			<body>reported OR for colorectal adenoma with 95% CIs, and the <lb/>covariates adjusted for in the analysis. <lb/>2.4. Statistical analysis <lb/>Three reviewers (LYC, YLY, and KHJ) independently assessed <lb/>the quality of all eligible studies using the risk of bias in non-<lb/>randomized studies of interventions scale. The ORs were <lb/>collected for analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was <lb/>assessed using both the x 2 test with a P value &lt;.10 and <lb/>inconsistency index (I 2 ) with a cutoff of 50%. Pooled effects with <lb/>95% CIs were derived using a fixed-effect model unless <lb/>significant heterogeneity was present, in which case a random-<lb/>effects model was applied. When a study provided different OR <lb/>estimates based on hospital-based controls and population-based <lb/>controls, the latter estimates were selected for the combined <lb/>analysis. We also calculated and presented a summary of the <lb/>adjusted ORs for the studies that provided adjusted results. <lb/>Publication bias was evaluated with a funnel plot and Egger test. <lb/>We examined the roles of several potential sources of <lb/>heterogeneity using restricted maximum likelihood-based ran-<lb/>dom-effects meta-regression analysis and subgroup analyses <lb/>according to geographic location, prevalence of diabetes (DM) <lb/>rate, the prevalence of H pylori infection rate, study design, the <lb/>sample size for the cases, subsite of the neoplasia, H pylori <lb/>detection method and sex. The estimated DM prevalence rate of <lb/>each study was referenced from the International Diabetes <lb/>Federation Atlas and local country government data or study <lb/>results (by WHY and HCT). We used the mean year of study <lb/>duration as the DM prevalence rate. According to the diabetes <lb/>prevalence rate of the study population, we classified the studies <lb/>into 4 groups: Group 1: DM prevalence &lt;6%; Group 2: DM <lb/>prevalence from 6% to 8%, Group 3: DM prevalence from 8% to <lb/>10%; and Group 4: DM prevalence &gt;10%. Statistical analyses <lb/>were performed by STATA version 11.0 (STATA Corporation, <lb/>College Station, TX, USA) and RevMan version 5.3 (The <lb/>Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). <lb/>2.5. Ethical statements <lb/>No ethical approval is required since this is a literature-based <lb/>study. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. Search results and study characteristics <lb/>After initial screening, the full text of 281 potentially eligible <lb/>articles was retrieved for detailed assessment, and 27 studies were <lb/>eligible for analysis. [3,6,8,9,19,21-42] All of the eligible studies <lb/>presented OR for colorectal adenoma related to H pylori <lb/>infection. [3,6,8,9,19,21-42] Nineteen of them are cross-sectional <lb/>studies, [3,6,8,19,21-24,25-28,30,31,35,37-40] and the remaining 8 are <lb/>case-control studies. [9,29,32-34,36,41,42] Serology was utilized as <lb/>the detection method for H pylori in 14 studies, [8,9,21,23,25-27,31-<lb/>35,38,39] pathology in 4, [3,22,40,42] urea breath test (UBT) in 4, [6,37] <lb/>Campylobacter-like organism test (CLO) in 6, [19,24,30,36] and <lb/>combining UBT and CLO in 2. [28,29] Gender and age are reported <lb/>in 22 [3,6,8,9,19,21-30,34-40] and 27 [3,6,8,9,19,21-35,37-39,41,42] studies, <lb/>respectively. Most studies were carried out in Asia (7 in Korea, 3 <lb/>in Taiwan, 3 in Japan, 1 in Thailand, and 1 in China) and the <lb/>remaining in the Americas (5 in the United States of America and <lb/>1 in Brazil) and in Europe (2 in Germany, 1 in Turkey, 1 in <lb/>Greece, and 1 in Israel). All included studies had assessed the <lb/>quality of all eligible studies using the risk of bias in non-<lb/>randomized studies of interventions scale and no serious risk of <lb/>bias after survey (in Appendix). <lb/>A flow chart describing the process of study selection is <lb/>shown in Figure 1. For the meta-analysis, data were extracted <lb/>from 27 studies with a total of 68,410 patients, and the pooled <lb/>OR for colorectal adenoma related to H pylori infection was <lb/>1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.63), although there was significant <lb/>heterogeneity (P &lt; .001) (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Because of <lb/>geographic and time differences in DM prevalence rate, [14,43-51] <lb/>subgroup analysis for the studies was performed by classifying <lb/>them into 4 groups: Group 1: DM prevalence &lt;6%; Group 2: <lb/>DM prevalence from 6% to 8%, Group 3: DM prevalence from <lb/>8% to 10%, and Group 4: DM prevalence &gt;10% (Table 1 and <lb/>Fig. 2). <lb/>In the subgroup analysis, the background population DM <lb/>prevalence &lt;6% studies had 3 studies with a total of 886 <lb/>patients. Meta-analysis of these studies revealed that the H pylori-<lb/>infected patients have an increased risk of having colorectal <lb/>adenoma with a pooled OR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.86-1.78) but no <lb/>significant difference. There was no significant heterogeneity <lb/>in Group 1 studies (P = .279). Since the study background <lb/>population DM prevalence increased more than 6%, the <lb/>H pylori-infected patients have a significantly increased risk of <lb/>having colorectal adenoma. This upturn was more significant <lb/>when the background population DM prevalence was approxi-<lb/>mately 6% to 8%. After a meta-analysis of these studies, the <lb/>H pylori-infected people had a higher risk of colorectal adenoma <lb/>than noninfected people. The pooled OR was 2.16 (95% CI <lb/>1.61-2.91), and a total of 11,655 patients were included. In these <lb/>studies, Lin study noted the DM prevalence in his study <lb/>participants, and males had an 8.1% prevalence of DM, and <lb/>females had a 6.1% prevalence of DM. Due to Lin study <lb/>population, 6.94% of patients had DM and were thus classified <lb/>into Group 2 for subgroup analysis. There was significant <lb/>heterogeneity in the Group 2 studies (P &lt; .01) <lb/>In Groups 3 and 4, similar results were observed. Compared to <lb/>that of Group 2 studies, the pooled OR of Groups 3 and 4 was <lb/>mildly decreased but still had a significantly elevated risk of <lb/>colorectal adenoma in H pylori-infected patients. For the <lb/>H pylori-infected patients, the risk of colorectal adenoma in <lb/>Group 3 was 1.40 (95% CI 1.24-1.57), and the Group 4 OR <lb/>was 1.52 (95% CI 1.46-1.57). The Group 3 studies included <lb/>28,431 patients, and the heterogeneity across studies was <lb/>marginal (I 2 = 58.6%, P = .013). There were 27,438 participants <lb/>included in Group 4 studies, and there was no significant <lb/>heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0%, P = .704). We also checked other <lb/>variables, including gender, detection methods of H pylori <lb/>infection, and study designs, and there was no evidence of <lb/>statistical relevance to OR for adenoma with H pylori infection. <lb/>3.2. Test of heterogeneity and publication bias <lb/>Heterogeneity was assessed by chi-square and I-square for the <lb/>included studies. The value of x 2 was &lt;0.01, and the I 2 was <lb/>61.9%. Due to the heterogeneity noted in our analysis, a random-<lb/>effects model was used. The shape of the funnel plots for studies <lb/>on the association between H pylori infection and the risk of <lb/>colorectal adenoma appeared asymmetrical (Fig. 3A), which <lb/>indicated that studies with positive correlation are reported more <lb/>often.

			<body>suggested that there was statistical evidence of publication bias <lb/>(Fig. 3B). <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>Since the discovery of H pylori as a cause of peptic ulcer disease <lb/>in 1983, this bacterial infection continues to be a major public <lb/>health issue worldwide. The prevalence of H pylori infection <lb/>varies by geographic area, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic <lb/>status; in fact, the prevalence is higher in developing countries <lb/>and in those in poor socioeconomic conditions. [52] Traditionally, <lb/>Western and Eastern countries have different H pylori infection <lb/>rates in their general populations. The prevalence is highest in <lb/>Africa (79.1%), Latin America, and Asia (54.7%). On the other <lb/>hand, the H pylori infection rate is lowest in Northern America <lb/>(37.1%) and Oceania (24.4%). [53,54] <lb/>As an infectious disease, H pylori can be cured with a course of <lb/>antibiotics and its infection rate decreased due to public health <lb/>improvement in developed countries and some developing <lb/>countries. However, as the prevalence rate of H pylori infection <lb/>remains high in most developing countries and is generally related <lb/>to socioeconomic status, it remains one of the most important <lb/>diseases in these areas. [54] Hong et al. published a meta-analysis <lb/>of H pylori infection and increased the risk of colorectal adenoma <lb/>formation. In this study, he focused on Eastern or Western studies <lb/>for subgroup analysis and found that the ORs of these 2 groups <lb/>were similar. [25] This means that even the H pylori infection <lb/>prevalence was different in Eastern and Western countries, and <lb/>this bacterial infection still increased colorectal adenoma <lb/>formation. Although the detailed mechanism of the relation <lb/>between H pylori infection and colorectal adenoma formation <lb/>was not clear. Butt and Epplein stated H pylori infection might <lb/>contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis by direct or indirect effect. <lb/>In direct effect, H pylori might secrete toxins and present in the <lb/>respective colorectal tissue. On the other hand, the indirect effect <lb/>included several hypotheses. First, H pylori infection could lead <lb/>to changes in the colonization of the gut with other bacteria and <lb/>then could induce colorectal carcinogenesis. Second, the gastrin <lb/>level might increase after H pylori infection and gastrin might act <lb/>as a mitogen. Third, H pylori was found to be associated with <lb/>metabolic diseases that are associated with CRC risk. [55] It also <lb/>hints at a link between H pylori infection and colorectal adenoma <lb/>formation, which may be due to the third factor in this <lb/>connection. <lb/>Records idenƟfied through <lb/>database searching <lb/>(n = 349) <lb/>Screening <lb/>Included <lb/>Eligibility <lb/>IdenƟficaƟon <lb/>AddiƟonal records idenƟfied <lb/>through other sources <lb/>(n = 59) <lb/>Records aŌer duplicates removed <lb/>(n = 241) <lb/>Records screened <lb/>(n = 241) <lb/>Records excluded (n = 157) <lb/>Not targeted arƟcle types (n = 45) <lb/>Topic unrelated to our study (n = 95) <lb/>Animal studies (n = 7) <lb/>No English or Chinese abstract (n = 10) <lb/>Full-text arƟcles assessed <lb/>for eligibility <lb/>(n = 119) <lb/>Full-text arƟcles excluded, with reasons (n = 92) <lb/>Not targeted arƟcle types (n = 7) <lb/>Topic unrelated to our study (n = 43) <lb/>Included pediatric paƟents (n = 3) <lb/>Duplicate reports on the same study populaƟon (n = 4) <lb/>Focus on malignancy (n = 22) <lb/>Focus on gastrin level (n = 5) <lb/>Focus on paƟents with specific genotype (n = 1) <lb/>Study recurrence colorectal adenomas (n = 1) <lb/>Full-text not available (n = 3) <lb/>Duplicate studies (n = 2) <lb/>Unable to retrieve data (n = 1) <lb/>Studies included in <lb/>qualitaƟve synthesis <lb/>(n = 27) <lb/>Studies included in <lb/>quanƟtaƟve synthesis <lb/>(meta-analysis) <lb/>(n = 27) <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>Unlike H pylori infection disease, the prevalence of DM in the <lb/>global world has persisted. The age-standardized DM prevalence <lb/>increased from 4.3% in 1980 to 9.0% in 2014 in men and from <lb/>5.0% to 7.9% in women. [56] The rise in prevalence might be due <lb/>to population growth and aging, as the number of adults with <lb/>diabetes has increased nearly 4-fold over the past 35 years. The <lb/>prevalence and number of adults with diabetes both increased <lb/>and doubled in men and increased by 60% in women worldwide, <lb/>shifting from an excess prevalence in women in 1980 to a higher <lb/>male prevalence in 2014. [57] Persistent high blood sugar <lb/>concentrations lead to damage to the blood vessels and peripheral <lb/>nerves. This situation might result in an increased risk of <lb/>cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke, kidney <lb/>disease, diabetic retinopathy, and foot amputations. [58] DM is <lb/>also considered an increased risk factor for colon adenoma and <lb/>carcinoma. [59] These DM-related complications lead to higher <lb/>costs for the health care system, [60] as well as lower quality of life <lb/>and reduced life expectancy. [61] <lb/>Although, a past study showed that DM prevalence was low in <lb/>much of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, [62] <lb/>recent reports have demonstrated an increase in China, India, <lb/>Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. [63-66] Some high-income English-<lb/>speaking countries, such as the USA and the United King-<lb/>dom, [44,67] also reported increased DM prevalence. On the other <lb/>hand, DM prevalence did not increase in Western Europe, like <lb/>Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland. [68,69] In accordance with a <lb/>previous statement and based on geographical distribution, the <lb/>prevalence of H pylori infection and DM seems to be inversely <lb/>related. In our study, when the background population DM <lb/>prevalence was below 6%, H pylori infection did not significantly <lb/>increase the risk of colorectal adenoma formation (Group 1). <lb/>This association became significant when the study population <lb/>DM prevalence was over 6% (Groups 2-4). The odds ratio of <lb/>H pylori infection-related colorectal formation was 2.16 (95% CI <lb/>1.61-2.91); it was the highest when the population DM <lb/>prevalence was from 6% to 8% (Group 2).

			<body>2010. The study&apos;s location may also affect this result. Most of the <lb/>Group 3 studies were from Korea, and Group 4 studies were from <lb/>the USA. The Group 2 studies were more heterogeneous in <lb/>location, including Japan, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, and Germany. <lb/>The H pylori infection rate of the study population was also <lb/>collected and is shown in Table 1. There was no significant <lb/>difference in the ORs of H pylori infection-associated colorectal <lb/>adenoma between the lower infection rate area (USA or <lb/>Germany, 35.3%-35.6%) and the middle infection rate area <lb/>(Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan; approximately 51.7%-55.8%). <lb/>Further evaluation for the other reason that Group 2 studies <lb/>revealed higher ORs in H pylori infection-associated colorectal <lb/>adenoma is necessary.

			<body>higher H pylori infection prevalence (71.2%) but a lower DM <lb/>prevalence rate (5.8%). (Table 1) Buso study demonstrated that <lb/>the H pylori infection proportion did not significantly increase <lb/>colorectal adenoma risk (OR: 1.98, 95% CI 0.82-3.15). [34] <lb/>However, when the DM prevalence was higher (&gt;10%), even <lb/>when the H pylori infection rate was lower (35.6%), the OR of <lb/>colorectal adenoma with H pylori infection was significantly <lb/>increased (Group 4: OR: 1.52, 95% CI 1.46-1.57). This means <lb/>that the DM prevalence rate might be the key factor of increased <lb/>colorectal adenoma risk with H pylori infection. <lb/>Our previous study demonstrated the interaction of hypergly-<lb/>cemia and H pylori infection in colon adenoma formation. We <lb/>found that the OR for adenoma was 1.437 (95% CI 1.197-<lb/>1.726) if H pylori was present or 1.629 (95% CI 1.239-2.14) if <lb/>HbA 1c ≥6.5. When combining these 2 factors, the OR was <lb/>elevated to 4.712 (95% CI 3.189-6.963), suggesting that these 2 <lb/>factors may have a synergistic effect in colorectal adenoma. [19] <lb/>The likely reason for the synergistic effect may involve several <lb/>processes. First, hyperglycemia status affected gastrointestinal <lb/>morphology and function and resulted in gut barrier loss and <lb/>changes in intestinal mucosa permeability. Second, high-fat and <lb/>high-caloric diets also increase gut permeability, and this <lb/>situation was more significant in DM patients. [70] Third, some <lb/>intestinal microorganism-related products, such as lipopolysac-<lb/>charides, would more efficiently pass through the gut barrier and <lb/>stimulate the Toll-like receptors in the mucosa. This would <lb/>trigger a serious inflammatory process, and finally, IL(interleu-<lb/>kin)-17 and IL-6 will increase. IL-17 activates the signal <lb/>transducer and activator of the transcription 3 pathway, <lb/>promoting cell proliferation and survival and finally inducing <lb/>tumorigenesis. [71] <lb/>These animal models and individualized study results support <lb/>this study finding that states that an elevated DM prevalence rate <lb/>enhances the risk of colorectal adenoma in H pylori-infected <lb/>populations. Our study still had several limitations. First, in our <lb/>subgroup analysis, we found that the Group 2 studies had more <lb/>heterogeneity. The reason for this condition may be related to <lb/>population studies with differences in study location, population, <lb/>aging, and gender. Despite this heterogeneity, H pylori infection <lb/>also increased the risk of colorectal adenoma. Second, the <lb/>asymmetry of the results of Egger test and funnel plots suggested <lb/>the possibility of publication bias. However, because most of our <lb/>included studies [3,6,8,9,19,21-42] had statistically significant results, <lb/>Egger test and funnel plots would show asymmetry. Third, the <lb/>population DM prevalence rate might not completely represent <lb/>our included studies participant&apos;s diabetes condition. Only Lin <lb/>et al. [24] and Hu et al. [19] included the DM prevalence rate in their <lb/>studies. To the best of our knowledge, we tried to estimate the <lb/>diabetes rate of each study as accurately as possible. <lb/>5. Conclusion <lb/>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that population DM <lb/>prevalence affects the risk of colorectal adenoma with H pylori <lb/>infection. Since diabetes prevalence was over 6% in the <lb/>background study population, H pylori infection became a more <lb/>significant factor in inducing colorectal adenoma formation. <lb/>Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the world, H pylori <lb/>eradication and hyperglycemia control might have an impact on <lb/>the prevention of colorectal neoplasm formation. <lb/></body>
