			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>The acquisition of nutrients is essential for maintenance of metabolic processes in all <lb/>organisms. Nutritional imbalance contributes to myriad metabolic disorders that include <lb/>malnutrition, diabetes, and even cancer. Recently, the importance of macronutrient ratio of food <lb/>has emerged as a critical factor to determine health outcomes. Here we show that individual <lb/>modifications to a completely defined diet markedly impact multiple aspects of organism <lb/>wellbeing in Drosophila melanogaster. Through a longitudinal survey of several diets we <lb/>demonstrate that increased levels of dietary glucose significantly improve longevity and <lb/>immunity in adult Drosophila. Our metagenomic studies, show that relative macronutrient levels <lb/>not only influence the host, but also have a profound impact on microbiota composition. <lb/>However, we found that elevated dietary glucose extended the lifespan of adult flies even when <lb/>raised in a germ-free environment. Furthermore, when challenged with a chronic enteric <lb/>infection, flies fed a diet with added glucose had increased survival times even in the absence of <lb/>an intact microbiota. Thus, in contrast to known links between the microbiota and animal health, <lb/>our findings uncover a novel microbiota-independent response to diet that impacts host <lb/>wellbeing. As dietary responses are highly conserved in animals, we believe our results offer a <lb/>general understanding of the association between glucose metabolism and animal health. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Recent developments in the production, distribution and consumption of food <lb/>fundamentally transformed our relationship with our nutritional environment. The near limitless <lb/>availability of ready-made, high-calorie meals is a prominent contributor to the emergence of <lb/>metabolic disorders as a major health challenge in many nations, and there is an increased <lb/>emphasis on the importance of nutritional awareness to optimize individual health outcomes <lb/>(Simpson et al., 2015). In this context, the obvious health benefits of a nutritionally replete diet <lb/>fuel a multi-billion dollar health and nutrition industry that centers on the pursuit of a &quot;balanced&quot; <lb/>diet. However, functional definitions of health and nutritional balance are more complex than <lb/>may seem apparent and require more than a steady intake of specific amounts of nutrients. <lb/>Dietary influence on longevity has been extensively studied in several vertebrate and <lb/>invertebrate models (Fontana and Partridge, 2015; Tatar et al., 2014). Initial, widely reported <lb/>observations showed that caloric restriction promotes a longer lifespan in rats, and this was <lb/>supported by subsequent studies in mice, Drosophila, worms, and yeast (Dilova et al., 2007; <lb/>Fontana et al., 2010). Recent long-term experiments yielded mixed observations on the benefits <lb/>of caloric restriction for primates (Colman et al., 2014; Mattison et al., 2012). However, the two <lb/>studies in question differed considerably in their experimental protocols, making comparisons <lb/>difficult. Exploration of the basis for extended longevity in models of caloric restriction <lb/>emphasized the relative contributions of individual nutrients to animal lifespan (Lee et al., 2015; <lb/>Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2009; Solon-Biet et al., 2015b). These studies revealed that diets <lb/>with low protein to carbohydrate ratios significantly extended the lifespans of mice and <lb/>Drosophila (Lee et al., 2008; Solon-Biet et al., 2014). More recent studies have focused on <lb/>additional dietary contributions to health and lifespan that include the time of consumption <lb/>(Jakubowicz et al., 2013; Mattson et al., 2014), duration of fasting between meals (Harvie et al., <lb/>2011; Honjoh et al., 2009), as well as relative amounts of amino acids in the diet (Miller et al., <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>2005; Wu et al., 2013). When considered as a whole, these studies point to a remarkably <lb/>nuanced relationship between the uptake of dietary nutrients and animal wellbeing. <lb/>Many studies of the interplay between nutrition and health overlook microbial <lb/>contributions. In particular, we know very little about the relationship between the intestinal <lb/>microflora, host diet, and host intestinal immunity. We consider this a particularly relevant <lb/>aspect of health and lifespan, as diet and health are intimately linked by the intestinal microbiota <lb/>(Flint et al., 2012). Diet shapes the composition of the intestinal microflora, which, in turn, <lb/>influences events as diverse as nutrient allocation, intestinal physiology, immune responses, <lb/>and the onset of chronic diseases. For example, the intestinal microbiota facilitates the uniquely <lb/>restricted diet of the koala (Osawa et al., 1992); orchestrates the establishment of immune <lb/>structures in mammals (Hooper et al., 2012); and contributes to the containment, or <lb/>dissemination of pathogenic microbes in a number of experimental models (Round and <lb/>Mazmanian, 2009; Wlodarska et al., 2015). The genetically accessible model system Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster is a particularly valuable tool to reveal key aspects of relationships between diet, <lb/>the microbiota and the host (Erkosar and Leulier, 2014; Ma et al., 2015). The fly gut shares <lb/>numerous similarities with mammalian counterparts that include developmental origin, cellular <lb/>composition, and metabolic pathways (Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013). Additionally, while <lb/>the mammalian gut contains 500-1000 separate bacterial species, the fly gut is far simpler to <lb/>study with 5-30 aerotolerant, cultivable commensal species (Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012; <lb/>Buchon et al., 2013). A number of recent publications established clear mechanistic <lb/>relationships between the intestinal microflora of flies and events as diverse as nutritional <lb/>regulation (Newell and Douglas, 2014; Storelli et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2014), activation of pro-<lb/>growth pathways (Shin et al., 2011; Storelli et al., 2011), control of immune pathways (Broderick <lb/>et al., 2014; Erkosar et al., 2014), and selection of mates (Sharon et al., 2010). <lb/>Previous studies with Drosophila as a tool to explore host-diet-microbiota relationships <lb/>relied on partially defined oligdic diets. Recently, Piper et al. established a protocol to prepare a <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>holidic diet for Drosophila, in which the exact composition and concentration of every ingredient <lb/>is known (Piper et al., 2014). This allows for precise manipulation of nutrient availability in <lb/>dietary studies, as individual components can be modified to a specified quantity and effects on <lb/>the organism can be observed. <lb/>In this study, we investigated how dietary modifications, inspired in part by popular <lb/>human diets, affect the health of a fly. Specifically, we made five separate modifications to the <lb/>original holidic recipe that include the addition of supplementary glucose, starch, casein, palmitic <lb/>acid, or ethanol. Respectively, these additions represent diets with higher levels of simple sugar, <lb/>complex sugar, protein, saturated fatty acids, or alcohol. We investigated several aspects of <lb/>overall health and nutrition and found that relatively modest dietary modifications exert profound <lb/>impacts on the lifespan, immune response, and microfloral composition of the host. Of the five <lb/>dietary modifications tested, we found that the elevation of dietary glucose emerged as the most <lb/>beneficial manipulation, with effects that included an extended lifespan, increased locomotion, <lb/>and enhanced immunity against an enteric pathogen. We were particularly intrigued by the <lb/>relationship between diet, the microbiome, longevity and immunity, as this issue has not been <lb/>tackled in a systematic study to date. We found that dietary supplementation of glucose greatly <lb/>increased the diversity of the intestinal microbiome. However, when we eliminated the <lb/>microbiota from flies, we found that the health benefits of increased glucose were largely <lb/>independent of the microbiota. Combined, our observations establish that elevated levels of <lb/>dietary glucose provide numerous benefits to fly health and immunity, and that these benefits do <lb/>not require an intestinal microbiota. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Diet and Age Modify Adult Metabolism in Drosophila. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>We initially measured the relationship between age, diet and metabolism in adult flies. For these <lb/>assays, we raised flies on a recently described holidic diet, or a holidic diet supplemented with <lb/>glucose, starch, casein, palmitic acid, or ethanol. The supplementary regimes allowed us to <lb/>interrogate the impacts of increased levels of simple or complex sugars, protein, saturated fatty <lb/>acids, or moderate amounts of alcohol on a common experimental model. We measured the <lb/>weight, protein content, triglyceride levels and glucose levels of male and female flies raised on <lb/>the respective diets for five days, ten days, or twenty days. We found that age exerted a <lb/>significant influence on the weight, protein content, and triglyceride content of adult flies, while <lb/>diet exerted moderate effects on protein levels (Figure 1A and B). In contrast, we found that diet <lb/>significantly affected triglyceride and glucose levels in flies. Specifically, we found that <lb/>supplementation of a holidic diet with extra glucose greatly increased triglyceride and glucose <lb/>levels in older flies compared to age-matched controls raised on the holidic diet (Figure 1C). <lb/>These data suggest that increased availability of dietary glucose elevates energy stores, <lb/>particularly in older flies, without significant effects on weight or protein content. <lb/>Elevated Glucose Availability Extends Adult Longevity. <lb/>Our data overlap with previous suggestions that dietary modifications have considerable <lb/>impacts on the metabolic profile of flies (Wong et al., 2014). Numerous studies implicate the <lb/>availability of nutrients and calories in the control of animal longevity, with a frequent implication <lb/>that caloric or dietary restriction extends life. However, recent studies also suggest that relative <lb/>amounts of macronutrients in the diet are important determinants of Drosophila lifespan (Lee et <lb/>al., 2008). Importantly, this hypothesis has not been tested with a defined diet in Drosophila. To <lb/>address this issue, we determined the lifespans of adult male and female flies raised under <lb/>defined dietary conditions. We found that dietary modifications had slightly different effects on <lb/>the longevity of male and female flies (Table 1, Figure 2A). In general, dietary modifications that <lb/>diminished lifespans, such as supplementation with palmitic acid or protein, had more <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>pronounced effects on female flies than male flies, while dietary modifications that extended <lb/>lifespans, such as addition of ethanol or glucose had more pronounced effects on male flies <lb/>than females (Figure 2A). We found that elevated glucose availability had a particularly marked <lb/>impact on longevity in male flies, with a median lifespan extension of 31%. A recent meta-<lb/>analysis suggested that the longevity benefits of dietary restriction are adaptations to laboratory <lb/>culture, not a physiological response observed in the wild (Nakagawa et al., 2012). To test if the <lb/>benefits of glucose addition are restricted to lab-raised flies, we fed adult male Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster captured in the wilds of Edmonton (Canada) an unmodified diet or one <lb/>supplemented with glucose. As with our lab strains, we found that elevated levels of dietary <lb/>glucose significantly increased the lifespan of wild flies (Figure 2B and D). <lb/>Restoration of a complete diet reverts lifespan-extension benefits of dietary restriction In <lb/>Drosophila (Mair et al., 2003). To determine if the benefits of glucose were permanent or <lb/>transient, we measured the longevity of male flies raised on a holidic diet, or male flies raised on <lb/>a holidic diet supplemented with extra glucose for the first five days, the first ten days, or the <lb/>duration of adult life. Our results show that longer periods of dietary supplementation with <lb/>glucose have more significant effects on lifespan (Figure 2C and D). For example, <lb/>supplementation of the adult diet with glucose for the first ten days of life extended median <lb/>survival rates by 12%, while permanent addition of extra glucose extended median survival <lb/>rates by 32%. These data suggest that overall levels of dietary glucose reversibly influence the <lb/>lifespan of adult Drosophila. <lb/>Elevated Levels of Dietary Glucose Promote Immunity Against an Intestinal Pathogen. <lb/>As malnutrition impairs immune functions in Drosophila (Vijendravarma et al., 2015), we asked if <lb/>defined dietary modifications influence host responses to challenges with an intestinal <lb/>pathogen. Drosophila is an established model for infection with the enteric pathogen Vibrio <lb/>cholerae (Blow et al., 2005). To determine if diet altered survival time during a V. cholerae <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>infection, we raised adult female flies on defined diets for ten days and measured survival after <lb/>delivering a lethal infectious dose of Vibrio. We chose female flies for these studies, as they <lb/>outlive male flies challenged with the same pathogen, allowing us to explore the effect of diet on <lb/>survival to a greater extent. We found that flies on a holidic diet had a median survival of 49 <lb/>hours after infection (Figure 3A and B). Supplementation with casein led to a slight decrease in <lb/>median survival, while the other dietary modifications all showed an increase in median lifespan. <lb/>Flies that were raised on increased glucose showed the most significant extension in survival <lb/>during infection ( =19.82, p&lt;0.0001). These data establish that defined nutritional regimes <lb/>influence the ability of Drosophila to combat an enteric infection, and in particular, that increased <lb/>levels of glucose significantly elevate the survival times for adult flies. <lb/>Diet Influences Locomotion. <lb/>As health and lifespan are commonly connected to physical activity, we asked if defined diets <lb/>influence activity in adult Drosophila. For these assays, we compared locomotion in flies raised <lb/>on a holidic diet to flies raised on the same diet supplemented with either glucose or ethanol. <lb/>We chose glucose and ethanol, as both treatments extended median survival rates in adults. In <lb/>each case, we trained flies with twelve-hour cycles of light and dark for five days, followed by <lb/>five days of constant darkness. This approach allowed us to determine the effects of diet on <lb/>activity, as well as the establishment and maintenance of circadian rhythms. We found that fly <lb/>locomotion quickly adapted to defined cycles of light and dark irrespective of the diet, with peak <lb/>activity levels after transitions to periods of light and sharp drops in locomotion after transitions <lb/>to periods of dark (Figure 4A, days 1-5). For all treatments, adult flies maintained this <lb/>behavioural pattern during the subsequent five days of constant darkness (Figure 4A, days 6-<lb/>10). We observed a clear peak of activity that corresponded to a twenty-four hour period for <lb/>days 1-5 and days 6-10, with a less prominent period of eight hours during days 1-5 irrespective <lb/>of the diet (Figure 4B). Combined, these data show that the individual diets do not affect the <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>ability of adult flies to maintain a circadian rhythm. However, examination of the data in Figures <lb/>4A and B suggest that diet influences general locomotion. To quantify the extent of this effect, <lb/>we tallied total daily movements for flies raised on the respective diets. We found that <lb/>supplementation with glucose greatly enhanced fly activity, while supplementation with ethanol <lb/>had a sedative effect. Addition of extra glucose to the medium boosted daily activity levels by <lb/>39% relative to the control population on a holidic diet, while provision of moderate amounts of <lb/>ethanol decreased daily locomotion by roughly 27% (Figure 4C). <lb/>Dietary Glucose Supplementation Alters Microbiota Composition and Increases <lb/>Diversity. <lb/>The studies detailed above uncover a number of effects of defined dietary modifications on the <lb/>health of adult flies. As the microbiota of the host is known to affect these factors, we assessed <lb/>the impact of defined diets on the intestinal microbiota. For these assays, we raised adults on <lb/>modified diets and performed 16S DNA sequencing on bacterial DNA isolated from their <lb/>intestinal tracts. Males and females raised on an unmodified holidic diet had similar microbiota <lb/>that were dominated by the Acetobacter genus (Figure 5A). We found that simple alterations to <lb/>this holidic diet resulted in profound changes in microbiota composition and diversity (Figure <lb/>5B). For example, when flies were raised on a diet supplemented with casein, the microbiota <lb/>shifted to predominantly Lactobacillus species. In contrast, supplementation with glucose <lb/>resulted in the largest increase in microbiota diversity (Shannon: Females=2.387, Males=1.789). <lb/>We also noticed a different response between males and females to the same dietary <lb/>modification, as seen for a diet supplemented with ethanol (Shannon: Females=2.383, <lb/>Males=0.193). Our data suggest that both host diet and sex markedly impact the composition of <lb/>intestinal microbiota, with supplementary glucose contributing to the greatest increase in <lb/>species diversity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Glucose Increases Lifespan and Survival to Infection Independent of the Microbiota. <lb/>At this stage, our data reveal wide-ranging impacts of dietary glucose supplementation on adult <lb/>flies, with significant effects on longevity, locomotion, energy stores, microfloral composition, <lb/>and immunity. Given the established links between intestinal microflora diversity and host health <lb/>(Norman et al., 2015), we asked if the microbiota is required for the beneficial effects of glucose <lb/>supplementation on longevity. For these assays, we fed adult male flies an unmodified holidic <lb/>diet or one supplemented with glucose and raised the flies under conventional or germ-free <lb/>conditions. Consistent with recent reports (Clark et al., 2015; Petkau et al., 2014), we found that <lb/>flies raised under germ-free conditions outlived their conventionally-reared counterparts (Figure <lb/>6A and B). Similar to our earlier experiments, we found that elevated dietary glucose increased <lb/>the median lifespan of adult flies by 25% compared to an unmodified diet. Strikingly, we found <lb/>that elimination of the microbiome did not affect the lifespan of flies raised on diets with elevated <lb/>glucose, suggesting that glucose levels influence host longevity independently of the <lb/>microbiome. <lb/>These unexpected observations prompted us to ask if the glucose-mediated <lb/>improvements to survival after challenges with Vibrio challenges require a microbiome. To <lb/>assess this, we fed adult Drosophila an unmodified holidic diet or one supplemented with <lb/>glucose and raised the flies under conventional or germ-free conditions. We then measured <lb/>survival after delivering a lethal infectious dose of Vibrio. As expected, we found that <lb/>conventional flies on an unmodified diet had a median survival of 49.5 hours (Figure 7A). <lb/>Removal of the microbiome significantly improved survival after infection with Vibrio (Figure 7B). <lb/>As before, we found that elevated dietary glucose significantly improved survival compared to <lb/>an unmodified diet ( <lb/>=17.390, p=&lt;0.0001). Remarkably, elimination of the microflora did not <lb/>alter the survival rates of flies raised on a high glucose diet and challenged with Vibrio. <lb/>Combined, the data in Figures 6 and 7 establish that the microfloral shifts associated with <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>transition to a high glucose diet are not essential for the immunological and lifespan benefits of <lb/>such a diet. <lb/>Increased Lifespan From Glucose is Independent of Intestinal Insulin Signaling. <lb/>Our observation that glucose promotes antibacterial defenses independently of an intact <lb/>intestinal microbiota suggests direct effects of glucose on host intestinal physiology. As previous <lb/>studies showed that high-sugar diets cause insulin resistance in Drosophila (Musselman et al., <lb/>2011), and inhibition of insulin signalling in the gut promotes longevity (Biteau et al., 2010), we <lb/>reasoned that elevated dietary glucose leads to insulin insensitivity in the intestine of adult flies, <lb/>thereby extending the lifespans of the fly. To test this hypothesis, we generated a temperature <lb/>sensitive esgGAL4, GAL80 ts /+ ; UASInR/+ (esg ts &gt;InR) Drosophila strain to control insulin <lb/>receptor activity in midgut progentiors. In this strain, the combination of esgGAL4 and GAL80 ts <lb/>transgenic elements induce insulin receptor (InR) activity in midgut progenitors of adult flies at <lb/>the restrictive temperature of 29°C. As described in a previous study (Biteau et al., 2010), <lb/>activation of the insulin receptor decreased the lifespans of adult flies compared to esgGAL4, <lb/>GAL80 ts /+ (esg ts /+) (Figure 8A and B). However, we found that esg ts &gt;InR flies raised on a diet <lb/>with added glucose significantly outlived esg ts &gt;InR counterparts raised on an unmodified diet. In <lb/>fact, the lifespan extensions observed upon addition of glucose were comparable for esg ts &gt;InR <lb/>and esg ts controls (Figure 8B). These data suggest that a high glucose diet extends adult <lb/>Drosophila lifespan independent of insulin receptor activity in the gut. <lb/></body>

			<body>DISCUSSION <lb/>The acquisition and allocation of nutrients is essential for maintenance of the intricate <lb/>cellular processes that define multicellular life. Nutritional imbalances are at the heart of global <lb/>health challenges that range from malnutrition to diabetes and meaningful solutions require a <lb/>complete appreciation of the effects of complex diets on host wellbeing. We used Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster as a tool to model the longitudinal consequences of defined diets in a common <lb/>experimental system. The holidic diet allowed us to manipulate relative nutrient levels with far <lb/>more precision than has been possible previously. Apart from the potentially whimsical <lb/>observation of a proverbial &quot;sugar rush&quot;, we noticed a number of benefits of elevated levels of <lb/>dietary glucose for adult flies. Increases to the levels of dietary glucose extended longevity, <lb/>improved resistance to enteric infection, and increased diversity of the intestinal microbiota. The <lb/>range of phenotypes suggests broad physiological responses to altered levels of dietary <lb/>glucose. <lb/>Consistent with two recent reports (Clark et al., 2015; Petkau et al., 2014), we found that <lb/>elimination of the adult microflora extended the lifespan of flies raised on a holidic diet. <lb/>However, it is important to emphasize that the relationship between microfloral presence and fly <lb/>longevity is by no means resolved, as other groups reported negative (Brummel et al., 2004) or <lb/>neutral (Ren et al., 2007) effects of germ-free culture conditions on adult longevity. We consider <lb/>it possible that the phenotypic variation between labs reflects differences between the <lb/>respective Drosophila genotypes, diets, or microbiomes. Despite the phenotypic similarities <lb/>between flies raised under germ-free conditions and flies raised on a high glucose diet, we <lb/>established that glucose does not require a microbiome to improve immunity or longevity. <lb/>Instead, our data suggest that host-intrinsic responses are key to the benefits of elevated levels <lb/>of dietary glucose. <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>At first glance, the health benefits of elevated glucose appear incongruous with <lb/>conventional dietary wisdoms, as chronic ingestion of carbohydrates is linked to metabolic <lb/>disorders such as diabetes, and caloric restriction enhances longevity in many model <lb/>organisms. However, recent studies established that dietary ratios of protein and carbohydrate <lb/>(P:C) exert a substantial influence on the health of flies and mice, with several phenotypic <lb/>benefits for animals raised on diets with low P:C ratios (Bruce et al., 2013; Grandison et al., <lb/>2009; Lee et al., 2008; Mirzaei et al., 2014; Piper et al., 2011; Solon-Biet et al., 2014; Solon-Biet <lb/>et al., 2015a; Solon-Biet et al., 2015c). Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that addition <lb/>of glucose, an effective drop in P:C ratio, boosted longevity, while addition of casein, an <lb/>effective increase in P:C ratio, reduced the lifespan of adult flies. Our studies extended these <lb/>observations to show that low P:C ratios improve immune responses to an intestinal pathogen, <lb/>and that elevated P:C ratios are detrimental to survival after infection with Vibrio cholerae. Of <lb/>note, the strength of the phenotypes differed for male and female flies, suggesting <lb/>endocrinological regulation of dietary effects on lifespan. <lb/>To date, there are few studies that explore interplays between nutrient access, <lb/>microfloral composition and animal health. In a preliminary set of experiments, we found that <lb/>germ-free flies resisted chronic intestinal challenges with Vibrio cholerae better than <lb/>conventional flies. The fly response to enteric infection is remarkably sophisticated and includes <lb/>the expression of bactericidal AMPs through the Immune Deficiency (IMD) response (Lemaitre <lb/>and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013). A previous study demonstrated that mutations in the IMD pathway <lb/>extend the lifespan of flies challenged with Vibrio cholerae (Wang et al., 2013), suggesting <lb/>deleterious contributions from IMD to the pathogenesis of Vibrio cholerae. As intestinal IMD <lb/>activity is lower in flies raised under germ-free conditions (Broderick et al., 2014), we speculate <lb/>that germ-free flies are better equipped to deal with Vibrio infections due to diminished intestinal <lb/>IMD activity. However, our data do not exclude alternative explanations such as effects of <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>glucose on the expression of pathogenicity factors by Vibrio. Future studies are required to <lb/>determine the mechanistic basis for dietary alterations of intestinal immune responses. <lb/>As nutritional status influences intestinal immunity in Drosophila (Vijendravarma et al., <lb/>2015), we asked if dietary modifications improve immune responses to Vibrio by modification of <lb/>the intestinal microflora. Several studies demonstrated that diet influences composition of the <lb/>fly&apos;s microbiota (Staubach et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2013). However, these studies relied on <lb/>substantial alterations to partially defined diets. We used the holidic diet to examine the effects <lb/>of specific macronutrients on microbiome makeup. Our results showed that remarkably simple <lb/>dietary changes, such as alterations to relative glucose or protein levels, drastically alter the <lb/>microbiota of adult flies. However, at least in the case of glucose, these modifications do not <lb/>directly influence the lifespan or immune response, as germ-free flies and their conventionally <lb/>reared counterparts have indistinguishable viability profiles when raised on diets with elevated <lb/>glucose. <lb/>As a cautionary note, we cannot exclude that some dietary modifications act at least <lb/>partially through effects on the microbiota in Drosophila. For example, a recent study <lb/>established that the commensal fungus Isatchenkia orientalis promotes amino acid uptake in <lb/>nutritionally deprived Drosophila (Yamada et al., 2015). In our study, we found that flies fed a <lb/>diet supplemented with moderate amounts of ethanol lived longer and survived infection better <lb/>than control flies raised on an unmodified diet. Since wild flies develop in and consume <lb/>decomposed fruit, ethanol is likely a common constituent of their environment. As ethanol is a <lb/>fuel source for Acetobacter, a prominent fly commensal that modifies insulin and TOR signals in <lb/>the midgut (Shin et al., 2011; Storelli et al., 2011), it remains possible that the lifespan extension <lb/>we see from ethanol depends on the microbiota. <lb/>Since we observed benefits from glucose independent of the microbiota, we were <lb/>interested in the host response to glucose that extends lifespan. High dietary glucose lowers <lb/>insulin sensitivity in flies (Musselman et al., 2011), and decreased insulin activity in the gut <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>increases lifespan in the fly (Biteau et al., 2010). These observations led us to speculate that <lb/>glucose increases longevity through reduced insulin receptor activity in the gut. However, our <lb/>results showed that overexpression of the insulin receptor in intestinal progenitor cells did not <lb/>impair the lifespan benefits of added glucose, suggesting that outputs from the gut insulin <lb/>receptor do not influence the benefits of elevated dietary glucose. Animals respond to their <lb/>nutritional environment through complex signal transduction pathways such as TOR and insulin <lb/>in several organs, and both pathways influence lifespan and health in numerous model <lb/>organisms (Harrison et al., 2009; Kapahi and Zid, 2004; Kapahi et al., 2004; Scialo et al., 2015; <lb/>Tatar et al., 2003; Vellai et al., 2003). In the case of flies, the gut, fat body, and insulin-producing <lb/>neurons coordinate the uptake and distribution of macronutrients (Buch et al., 2008). A more <lb/>extensive analysis of the physiological benefits of increased glucose will likely require dissection <lb/>of TOR and insulin responses in these tissues. <lb/>In summary, this study complements an emerging body of literature that low dietary P:C <lb/>ratios extend the lifespan of Drosophila. In addition, we show that alterations to P:C ratios <lb/>generate significant phenotypes in locomotion, immunity, and microfloral diversity. Despite the <lb/>links between the intestinal microflora and animal health, we established that glucose acts <lb/>directly on the host to increase lifespan and responses to cholerae infections. As physiological <lb/>responses to diet are extensively conserved throughout the animal kingdom, we believe our <lb/>findings may be of relevance to a general appreciation of the relationship between glucose <lb/>consumption and animal health. <lb/></body>

			<body>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Fly Husbandry <lb/>All experiments were performed with virgin female and male adult flies raised at 29°C. w 1118 flies <lb/>were used as a control genotype unless otherwise mentioned. The esgGAL4 flies described in <lb/>this study have been described elsewhere (Buchon et al., 2009). The wild Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster population was derived from a single pregnant female captured in EF&apos;s kitchen in <lb/>Edmonton (Canadan) in the summer of 2014. Adult flies were raised on a holidic medium <lb/>developed by Piper et al. using the Oaa stock recipe and 100 mM biologically available nitrogen <lb/>(Piper et al., 2014). Modifications to this diet include: the additions of simple sugar (100 g/L D-<lb/>glucose), complex sugar (50 g/L starch), protein (70 g/L casein), fatty acid (50 g/L palmitic acid), <lb/>and alcohol (1% ethanol). Germ-free flies were generated by raising adults on food <lb/>supplemented with an antibiotic cocktail (100 µg/mL ampicillin, 50 µg/mL vancomycin, 100 <lb/>µg/mL neomycin, and 100 µg/mL metronidazole). Survival assays were performed with approx. <lb/>50 flies housed at 10 flies/vial and transferred to fresh vials weekly. <lb/>Metabolic Assays <lb/>All metabolic assays were performed as described in (Wong et al., 2014) in 96-well plates using <lb/>commercial kits: the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, 500-0116), Triglyceride Assay kit (Sigma, <lb/>TG-5-RB), and Glucose (GO) Assay kit (Sigma, GAGO20). Colorimetric readings were obtained <lb/>using a microplate spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Envision Multilabel Reader). <lb/>Locomotion Assay <lb/>Holidic medium was added to small glass tubes capped with a plastic stopper. A single fly was <lb/>placed in each tube. The tube was then closed with yarn and then placed into monitors of the <lb/>TriKinetics DAMSystem. Fly activity was monitored for 10 days at 23°C.

Flies were <lb/>starved by placing in empty vials for 2 h prior to infection. Flies were then maintained in vials <lb/>containing a cellulose acetate plug infused with 3 mL of V. cholerae C6706 (10 8 -10 9 cells/mL) in <lb/>LB, and viability was monitored over a 5-day period. <lb/>Microbiota sequencing. <lb/>Samples of 10 adult male or female flies were raised for 10 days at 29°C. Intestinal tracts were <lb/>dissected as described elsewhere and bacterial genomic DNA was isolated with the Ultraclean <lb/>Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO, 12224). Bacterial 16S DNA was amplified with primers <lb/>AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG (forward) and GGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT (reverse). Samples <lb/>were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, 28104). Samples were prepared for <lb/>sequencing using a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, FC-131-1024), and DNA <lb/>libraries were sequenced using a MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (Illumina). Taxonomy assignment <lb/>was based on the SILVA SSU Ref NR99 database release 115, using in-house developed <lb/>software. <lb/></body>
