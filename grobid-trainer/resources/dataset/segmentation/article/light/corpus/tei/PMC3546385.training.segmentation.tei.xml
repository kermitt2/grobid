Here, using genetic paternity <lb/>data, we describe mating patterns in a wild population of red deer (Cervus <lb/>elaphus) which are associated with marked consequences for co-ancestry <lb/>and inbreeding in the population. Around a fifth of females mate with a <lb/>male with whom they have mated previously, and further, females <lb/>frequently mate with a male with whom a female relative has also mated <lb/>(intralineage polygyny). Both of these phenomena occur more than <lb/>expected under random mating. Using simulations, we demonstrate that <lb/>temporal and spatial factors, as well as skew in male breeding success, are <lb/>important in promoting both re-mating behaviours and intralineage poly-<lb/>gyny. However, the information modelled was not sufficient to explain the <lb/>extent to which these behaviours occurred. We show that re-mating and <lb/>intralineage polygyny are associated with increased pairwise relatedness in <lb/>the population and a rise in average inbreeding coefficients. In particular, <lb/>the latter resulted from a correlation between male relatedness and rutting <lb/>location, with related males being more likely to rut in proximity to one <lb/>another. These patterns, alongside their consequences for the genetic struc-<lb/>ture of the population, have rarely been documented in wild polygynous <lb/>mammals, yet they have important implications for our understanding of <lb/>genetic structure, inbreeding avoidance and dispersal in such systems. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The use of molecular techniques to assign parentage in <lb/>wild populations has been revolutionary in a variety of <lb/>wild vertebrate taxa in revealing fine-scale spatial <lb/>genetic structure arising from limited dispersal (Hughes, <lb/>1998; Piertney et al., 1999; Shorey et al., 2000; Nussey <lb/>et al., 2005). In polygynous mammals, it is most com-<lb/>mon for females to be philopatric and males to disperse, <lb/>leading to aggregations of females in matrilineal groups <lb/>(Clutton-Brock, 1989). Where females are philopatric, <lb/>and mating is nonrandom, it can have substantial effects <lb/>on kinship and inbreeding within groups, particularly if <lb/>males are also philopatric during breeding (Chesser, <lb/>1991). Recently, there has been a rise in the number of <lb/>studies reporting a lack of inbreeding avoidance in verte-<lb/>brate taxa and even inbreeding preference in some popu-<lb/>lations (for example: Kleven et al., 2005; Rioux-Paquette <lb/>et al., 2010; Wang &amp; Lu, 2011). However, undertaking <lb/>robust tests of inbreeding avoidance in wild populations is <lb/>extremely challenging (Part, 1996; Keller &amp; Arcese, 1998) <lb/>and requires careful consideration of the set of potential <lb/>mates available. Further, it is constructive to understand <lb/>what aspects of the mating system -such as spatial <lb/>genetic structuring -are associated with such outcomes. <lb/></body>

			<body>Two aspects of mating systems have been revealed in <lb/>polygynous mammals which, although extremely rarely <lb/>reported, are potentially highly significant to the link <lb/>between philopatry and co-ancestry/inbreeding. These <lb/>are &apos;mate fidelity&apos; (or &apos;re-mating frequency&apos;), females <lb/>mating with the same male in one or more distinct <lb/>breeding attempts (but without the establishment of a <lb/>pair bond, that is, in contrast to the permanent pair <lb/>bonds exhibited in monogamous species), and &apos;intralin-<lb/>eage polygyny&apos;, whereby female relatives show a pro-<lb/>pensity to mate with the same male (Rossiter et al., <lb/>2005). Despite the clear potential for such behaviour in <lb/>species with female philopatry, few studies report having <lb/>capitalized upon new molecular techniques to test for <lb/>such behaviour in polygynous systems, and so the extent <lb/>to which it occurs is difficult to assess. However, there is <lb/>evidence that it occurs in three polygynous mammals: <lb/>red deer, grey seals and greater horseshoe bats. In red <lb/>deer, Cervus elaphus, estimates of re-mating rates from <lb/>behavioural observations of a small number of breeding <lb/>hinds (29-32) over two consecutive 2-year periods <lb/>ranged from 15.6% to 24.1% (Clutton-Brock et al., <lb/>1982b). In a study of paternity in grey seals, Halichoerus <lb/>grypus, 30% of pups born to the same mother were found <lb/>to be in full-sibs. In a species where litter size is usually <lb/>one, and in which females mate in multiple years, this <lb/>suggests many females were re-mating with the same <lb/>male across years (Amos et al., 1995). However, using a <lb/>longer time series, the proportion of full-sibs was later <lb/>estimated to be substantially lower in the same popula-<lb/>tion (Worthington Wilmer et al., 2000), and no evidence <lb/>of re-mating was found in a population of harbour seals <lb/>(Coltman et al., 1999). Other evidence for re-mating has <lb/>been found in the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus <lb/>ferrumequinum (Rossiter et al., 2005), in which the <lb/>authors showed 56.8% of females mating in more than <lb/>1 year paired with the same male in multiple years, and <lb/>that such repeated pairings between individuals occurred <lb/>more than expected by chance. <lb/>Further to evidence for re-mating, molecular studies <lb/>of the greater horseshoe bat have revealed that matri-<lb/>lineal relatives also mated with the same males more <lb/>frequently than expected by chance (termed &apos;intralin-<lb/>eage polygyny&apos;). Intralineage polygyny is expected to <lb/>arise when there are both strong philopatry amongst <lb/>females -so that females are likely to associate in kin <lb/>groups -and also strong polygyny, so that those groups <lb/>of females are likely to be monopolized by single males; <lb/>however in the greater horseshoe bat, females also <lb/>mate with males in satellite caves away from their natal <lb/>site (Rossiter et al., 2005), and so this behaviour cannot <lb/>entirely be explained by female philopatry. The interplay <lb/>between philopatry and polygyny, resulting in intralin-<lb/>eage polygyny, is likely to have important consequences <lb/>for population genetic structure, increasing co-ancestry <lb/>amongst females within social groups (Chesser, 1991). <lb/>In the greater horseshoe bat, intralineage polygyny <lb/>combined with females repeatedly pairing with particu-<lb/>lar males is associated with an increase in pairwise <lb/>relatedness coefficients, and significant genetic differenti-<lb/>ation between groups of matrilineal relatives (Rossiter <lb/>et al., 2005). <lb/>Rossiter et al. (2005) argue that increased pairwise <lb/>relatedness is likely to strengthen ties between roosting <lb/>females and therefore cooperation within social groups. <lb/>In general, where generations of females are over-<lb/>lapping, intralineage polygyny and females re-mating <lb/>with previous partners may raise co-ancestry but also <lb/>increase the potential for inbreeding to occur (Chesser, <lb/>1991; Storz, 1999). The extent to which these processes <lb/>result in increased inbreeding coefficients will be <lb/>dependent upon whether males show fidelity to mating <lb/>sites between years, whether male tenure overlaps with <lb/>the onset of sexual maturity of female offspring and <lb/>whether there is random dispersal of male offspring, <lb/>particularly whether male offspring ever obtain mating <lb/>success within their natal group (Storz, 1999). In gen-<lb/>eral, the risk of inbreeding is not increased by female <lb/>philopatry unless there is also a nonrandom spatial dis-<lb/>tribution of males with respect to relatedness (Foerster <lb/>et al., 2006). Further, even where demographic circum-<lb/>stances increase the potential for inbreeding, if individ-<lb/>uals are able to recognize kin, they may avoid mating <lb/>with them (Pusey &amp; Wolf, 1996; Foerster et al., 2006), <lb/>although there is little evidence for this in species with <lb/>dispersal (Clutton-Brock &amp; McAuliffe, 2009). In greater <lb/>horseshoe bats, no increase in inbreeding was found <lb/>from that expected under random mating (Rossiter <lb/>et al., 2005). <lb/>This study: the potential for re-mating and <lb/>intralineage polygyny <lb/>In this study, we use molecular paternity data to exam-<lb/>ine the patterns of mating in a wild population of red <lb/>deer living on the North Block of the Isle of Rum, Scot-<lb/>land. We quantify the extent to which females mate <lb/>with the same male in multiple years and to which <lb/>females from the same matriline tend to mate with the <lb/>same male. Further, we examine associated changes in <lb/>pairwise relatedness and inbreeding within the popula-<lb/>tion. Testing whether females re-mating with previous <lb/>partners and intralineage polygyny are occurring more <lb/>than would be expected by chance, and for the effects <lb/>of such parameters on relatedness and inbreeding coef-<lb/>ficients, necessarily requires comparing the observed <lb/>mating outcomes with those expected under random <lb/>mating, which can be modelled using simulated data. <lb/>Such techniques can also be used to determine whether <lb/>the observed outcomes are an artefact of known aspects <lb/>of the breeding system, such as a preference for partic-<lb/>ular mating sites, by modelling such information within <lb/>the simulations.

			<body>spatial parameters, has been successfully used to assess <lb/>whether inbreeding avoidance occurs more often than <lb/>expected under random mating (Keller &amp; Arcese, 1998; <lb/>Hansson et al., 2007; Szulkin et al., 2009); yet to date, <lb/>studies examining pairs re-mating have relied on some-<lb/>what anecdotal evidence to suggest that the findings <lb/>are not an outcome of site fidelity (Amos et al., 1995; <lb/>Rossiter et al., 2005). <lb/>Red deer have a polygynous, harem defence mating <lb/>system, in which males compete to herd and defend <lb/>groups of females, and to mate with females within <lb/>those groups which are in oestrus. Previous studies <lb/>using behavioural data have found some evidence for <lb/>both females re-mating with the same male (see above) <lb/>and for intralineage polygyny in this system, with <lb/>around 15% of daughters mating with the same male <lb/>as their mother and 10% of mature sisters mating with <lb/>the same male (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b). Various <lb/>spatial and temporal aspects of the red deer mating sys-<lb/>tem suggest the potential for both re-mating and intra-<lb/>lineage polygyny. Males live outside the study area for <lb/>the majority of the year, returning prior to the breeding <lb/>season (rut) to the main hind feeding grounds to mate. <lb/>Young males disperse from their natal groups after the <lb/>age of 2, and outside the rut, adult males do not show <lb/>spatial genetic structure (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b; <lb/>Nussey et al., 2005). However, whether there is spatial <lb/>genetic structuring of males during the rut, when they <lb/>return to defend harems in the study area, is unknown. <lb/>Preliminary analyses have suggested that a male&apos;s loca-<lb/>tion during the rut is highly repeatable, with 50-70% <lb/>of variance in male location explained by male iden-<lb/>tity (K.V. Stopher, T.H. Clutton-Brock &amp; J. Pemberton, <lb/>unpublished data), suggesting that males return to rut <lb/>in the same area in multiple years. Females in this pop-<lb/>ulation are philopatric, usually remaining within the <lb/>natal group to which they were born, so that the <lb/>female population consists of mostly matrilineal groups <lb/>which demonstrate strong location fidelity (Albon et al., <lb/>1992). Very fine-scale genetic structuring (&lt; 100 m) <lb/>has been shown amongst females (although this has <lb/>declined over time, Nussey et al., 2005). During the rut, <lb/>females occupy a constricted version of their normal <lb/>home range (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b). Overall, <lb/>therefore, the potential for males and females to mate <lb/>in the same location each year is high, as is the poten-<lb/>tial for female relatives to be mating in the same place. <lb/>There is also substantial individual consistency of rut <lb/>timing that potentially promotes these behaviours in <lb/>the population. Males generally do not rut for the <lb/>entire breeding season, but at some point become <lb/>exhausted and leave the rutting area; male rut start, <lb/>and median and end dates have been shown to be <lb/>highly repeatable within individuals (Clements et al., <lb/>2011). Females are in oestrus only briefly and usu-<lb/>ally mate only once (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b). <lb/>Although the majority of oestruses occur during a <lb/>2-week peak of the breeding season, they can be dis-<lb/>tributed over as much as 4 months. Female oestrus date <lb/>has not been found to be particularly repeatable within <lb/>individuals; however, given that parturition date is <lb/>highly repeatable and the two are significantly corre-<lb/>lated at both the phenotypic and genetic level <lb/>(Clements et al., 2011), this finding is potentially con-<lb/>founded by the power available to detect repeatability. <lb/>Further, nonlactating females that are closely associated <lb/>within the same social group have been found to have <lb/>synchronized oestruses (Iason &amp; Guinness, 1985), and <lb/>Clements et al. (2011) noted a significant sire effect on <lb/>female oestrus date, suggesting that there may be con-<lb/>sistent spatial differences in female oestrus date com-<lb/>bined with fidelity of rutting sites by males across <lb/>years. This therefore suggests female relatives associat-<lb/>ing within the same area or matrilineal group may be <lb/>prone to mating at the same time, and are therefore <lb/>more likely to mate with the same male. <lb/>In this study, we compare the observed mating out-<lb/>comes, derived from a genetic pedigree, to those pro-<lb/>duced under a number of random mating scenarios, each <lb/>with sequentially greater constraints: fully random mat-<lb/>ing (&apos;Random&apos;), random mating temporally constrained <lb/>by the timing of female oestrus (&apos;Temporal&apos;), random <lb/>mating temporally constrained and also spatially con-<lb/>strained to potential mates within 500 or 100 m (&apos;Spatial <lb/>500 m&apos; and &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;), and finally temporally and <lb/>spatially constrained random mating in which the proba-<lb/>bility of a male mating is dependent either upon his age <lb/>(&apos;Age-corrected&apos;) or lifetime breeding success [&apos;Breeding <lb/>Success-corrected&apos; (&apos;BS-corrected&apos;)]. We compare the <lb/>frequency at which repeated pairings occur and the lev-<lb/>els of intralineage polygyny, in the observed and simu-<lb/>lated pedigrees, as well as relatedness and inbreeding <lb/>coefficients, to determine the extent to which such <lb/>nonrandom mating occurs and the effect it has on the <lb/>relatedness structure of the population. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Study system <lb/>Data were collected from a wild population of red deer, <lb/>C. elaphus, resident in the North Block of the Isle of <lb/>Rum, Scotland, which has been intensively studied <lb/>since 1971. The study area comprises approximately <lb/>14% of the island area as a whole and between <lb/>15-25% of the deer on the island. In this study, we <lb/>studied mating success during the ruts of 1971-2006. In <lb/>this population, all individuals can be recognized, <lb/>through either natural markings or artificial markings <lb/>applied when individuals are captured at birth. Individ-<lb/>uals are assigned to matrilines by tracing an individual&apos;s <lb/>maternal line back to one female alive when the study <lb/>began. Eighty-five matrilines exist, with a maximum of <lb/>nine generations over the years used in this analysis. <lb/></body>

			<body>Necessarily, this assumes all females at the start of the <lb/>study are unrelated; although this assumption is unli-<lb/>kely to be realistic, it is conservative with respect to <lb/>intralineage polygyny, given that some apparently <lb/>unrelated females mating with the same male will in <lb/>fact share a maternal ancestor. During the rut, daily <lb/>censuses are conducted which record the location (to <lb/>the nearest 100 m) and identity of all females and all <lb/>males which are defending harems of females. Female <lb/>oestrus date can be calculated by backdating from the <lb/>date of birth of subsequent offspring by 235 days <lb/>(standard deviation = 5); we then assume that the <lb/>female has conceived within this 11-day &apos;oestrus win-<lb/>dow&apos; (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b). Females produce <lb/>one offspring per year, although not all females breed <lb/>in each year. Females can conceive at the age of two; <lb/>after the age of five, female fecundity is generally <lb/>constant until it begins to decline at around 13 years <lb/>(Nussey et al., 2009). Male annual breeding success <lb/>(ABS) is highly skewed (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b) <lb/>and is strongly correlated with age (Nussey et al., <lb/>2009). Males rarely breed before 5, with ABS peaking <lb/>at 8-10 years and then declining in later life (Nussey <lb/>et al., 2009). Males therefore begin breeding much <lb/>later in life and have a much shorter breeding tenure <lb/>than females. <lb/>Paternity assignment <lb/>Daily observations are made during the calving season <lb/>(approximately 20th May to 30th June) to identify <lb/>calving date for each female and monitor neonatal <lb/>survival (Clutton-Brock et al., 1982a,b), and to catch <lb/>calves and take tissue samples for genotyping. Other <lb/>individuals not caught at birth are sampled from cast <lb/>antlers, by chemical immobilization or post-mortem. <lb/>Individuals born since 1991 were genotyped at up to <lb/>15 highly variable microsatellites; prior to this, individ-<lb/>uals were genotyped at up to eight microsatellites. <lb/>Paternities were assigned using the programs MasterBa-<lb/>yes (Hadfield et al., 2006) and COLONY2 (Wang &amp; San-<lb/>ture, 2009) with &gt; 80% individual confidence, with <lb/>preference given to assignments made by the MasterBa-<lb/>yes program, and COLONY2 used to assign paternities <lb/>where MasterBayes could not assign a father at 80% <lb/>individual confidence (see Walling et al., 2010 for full <lb/>details). The use of categorical pedigrees such as this is <lb/>potentially misleading, as they do not explicitly incor-<lb/>porate the error around paternity assignments. Analysis <lb/>was undertaken to address this potential problem (pre-<lb/>sented in Data S1), and we were able to demonstrate <lb/>that it has no effect on our findings. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>All analyses were carried out in R 2.8.1 (R Develop-<lb/>ment Core Team 2008). <lb/>For each year, lists of candidate females (those which <lb/>calved the following spring) and candidate males (those <lb/>seen to hold a harem in that year) were drawn up, and <lb/>six types of simulated pedigrees were generated: <lb/>1 &apos;Random&apos;: each female was randomly assigned a <lb/>male from the candidate male list. <lb/>2 &apos;Temporal Random&apos;: each female was randomly <lb/>assigned a male from the candidate male list that was <lb/>known to have held a harem during her calculated <lb/>&apos;oestrus window&apos;. <lb/>3 &apos;Spatial Random&apos;: as for temporal random, but the <lb/>list of potential males was further restricted to those <lb/>holding a harem within (i) 500 m (&apos;Spatial 500 m&apos;) <lb/>or (ii) 100 m (&apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;) of the female&apos;s loca-<lb/>tion on the potential day of conception. These values <lb/>were chosen after preliminary analysis revealed that <lb/>75% of females mate with males rutting within <lb/>500 m of their location on the day of conception and <lb/>50% of females mate with a male within 100 m of <lb/>their location. <lb/>4 &apos;Age-corrected&apos;: as for &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;, but with the <lb/>sampling of temporally and spatially available males <lb/>weighted by the probability of gaining reproductive <lb/>success given their age. Male ABS is highly corre-<lb/>lated with age (Nussey et al., 2009). We constructed <lb/>a linear model of age and its quadratic term against <lb/>male ABS for the pedigree data used in this study <lb/>(2083 observations across 603 males), and from this <lb/>extracted the probability of males of different ages <lb/>gaining a paternity. The sampling of candidate males <lb/>was then weighted by this probability. <lb/>5 &apos;BS-corrected&apos;: as for &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;, but with the <lb/>sampling of temporally and spatially available males <lb/>weighted by the probability of gaining reproductive <lb/>success given the male&apos;s lifetime breeding success. <lb/>To calculate this, we constructed a linear model of <lb/>male identity against male ABS, and from this <lb/>extracted the probability of each male gaining a <lb/>paternity. <lb/>Candidate males within each year were sampled with <lb/>replacement, and all females that calved in each year <lb/>were assigned a new mate. Each randomization was <lb/>constructed on an annual basis, but then for each <lb/>randomization type, all years were combined to pro-<lb/>duce a randomized pedigree covering the whole study <lb/>period. This was repeated 1000 times for each randomi-<lb/>zation type. Offspring retained their true mothers <lb/>throughout the simulations. <lb/>Pedigree statistics <lb/>Pedigree statistics (e.g. re-mating frequency, intralin-<lb/>eage polygyny, pairwise relatedness and inbreeding <lb/>coefficients) were calculated for each of the 1000 simu-<lb/>lations of each randomization type. For each pedigree <lb/>statistic, an average and standard deviation were calcu-<lb/>lated across the 1000 simulations. <lb/></body>

			<body>All measures described were compared between the <lb/>observed pedigree and the average of the 1000 simula-<lb/>tions for each randomization type, using Z tests with the <lb/>calculated standard deviation as described. The distribu-<lb/>tions of the simulated statistics were good approxima-<lb/>tions to the normal distribution. Z tests were carried out <lb/>in R version 2.8.1 (R Development Team 2008). Given <lb/>several Z tests were carried out per hypothesis (between <lb/>and 18), we used a Bonferroni correction to calculate <lb/>the appropriate significance level. <lb/>Calculating frequency of re-mating <lb/>For each male-female pair known to have mated, we <lb/>calculated whether they had re-mated when they had <lb/>the opportunity to do so, giving the number of pairs, <lb/>females and males that did re-mate and the number <lb/>which did not, despite having the potential to do so. <lb/>The potential to re-mate is restricted by the presence or <lb/>absence of previous partners: in addition to deaths and <lb/>births changing the available populations of females <lb/>and males over the study period, in calculating oppor-<lb/>tunities to mate we also took into account (i) females <lb/>do not conceive every year and (ii) most males spend <lb/>the majority of their time resident outside of the study <lb/>area, only returning for the rut; and not all males <lb/>known to be alive in the study population return each <lb/>year. Therefore, for any pair that had mated, we calcu-<lb/>lated in which other years both (i) the female of the <lb/>pair was receptive to mating (conceived and gave birth <lb/>to a calf the following year) and (ii) the male rutted <lb/>within the study area (and was therefore a potential <lb/>father in the paternity analysis), and scored whether <lb/>they re-mated in that year (1 for yes, 0 for no). <lb/>From this, we then calculated the number of pairs <lb/>that had mated in more than 1 year divided by the <lb/>number of all pairs known to have the opportunity to <lb/>mate in more than 1 year (as a percentage). We then <lb/>calculated the percentage of females and males in <lb/>known pairs that were involved in re-mating events. <lb/>We also calculated a number of other statistics describ-<lb/>ing the patterns of re-mating: (i) the average size of <lb/>full-sibships within the pedigree and (ii) the ratio of <lb/>different males a female mated with in her lifetime to <lb/>the number of offspring she produced. <lb/>Calculating the extent to which female relatives mated <lb/>with the same male (intralineage polygyny) <lb/>We calculated the ratio of different females a male <lb/>mated with in his lifetime to the number of different <lb/>matrilines those females came from, so that a value of <lb/>one describes a male who never mated with females <lb/>which were relatives, and values &lt; 1 indicate increasing <lb/>amounts of intralineage polygyny. <lb/>Relatedness and inbreeding coefficients <lb/>Relatedness coefficients were calculated using the <lb/>R package &apos;kinship&apos; (Atkinson, 2008). Inbreeding <lb/>coefficients were calculated using the R package &apos;pedi-<lb/>gree&apos; (Coster, 2008): we calculated average coefficients, <lb/>the total number of nonzero coefficients and the num-<lb/>ber of coefficients ! 0.125 (representing close inbreed-<lb/>ing events). <lb/>Genetic structuring of the rutting male population <lb/>Pairwise relatedness coefficients were calculated for all <lb/>males in the pedigree. To calculate spatial distances <lb/>between males, we calculated the lifetime average <lb/>rutting location of each male to the nearest 100 m <lb/>from census data, and from this calculated distances <lb/>between these locations for each pair of males in <lb/>metres. The correlation between pairwise relatedness <lb/>and pairwise spatial separation was tested in a linear <lb/>mixed-effects model, with relatedness as the response <lb/>variable and the identity of each of the pair as random <lb/>effects. <lb/>Results <lb/>Re-mating frequency <lb/>The number of of pairs mated in more than 1 year is <lb/>9.2% (134 of 1456), so that 22.4% (109 of 486) of <lb/>females and 25.9% (60 of 232) of males mated with a <lb/>partner with whom they had mated previously (see <lb/>Fig. 1 for an example of this). This was significantly <lb/>higher than expected under either random mating <lb/>(&apos;Random&apos;), random mating constrained to males <lb/>rutting when a female was in her oestrus window <lb/>(&apos;Temporal&apos;), or random mating constrained to males <lb/>rutting within 500 or 100 m of a female during her <lb/>oestrus window (&apos;Spatial 500 m&apos; and &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;, <lb/>see Table 1, Fig. 2). The percentage of pairs and males <lb/>re-mating was also significantly higher in the observed <lb/>pedigree than in the &apos;Age-corrected&apos; or &apos;BS-corrected&apos; <lb/>simulations (see Table 1). However, although there was <lb/>a strong trend towards significance, after a Bonferroni <lb/>correction, the observed percentage of females re-mat-<lb/>ing was not significantly greater than in the &apos;Age-cor-<lb/>rected&apos; or &apos;BS-corrected&apos; simulations (&apos;Age-corrected&apos;, <lb/>Z = 2.68, P = 0.004, &apos;BS-corrected&apos;, Z = 2.13, P = 0.017, <lb/>number of tests = 18, therefore, Bonferroni level of <lb/>significance = 0.003). <lb/>Amongst calves with assigned paternity, on average, <lb/>females bred in 3.32 ± 0.11 (standard deviation), years, <lb/>with 3.00 ± 0.09 (standard deviation) different males. <lb/>In total, 134 parental combinations made up of 108 <lb/>females and 60 males were repeated on an average of <lb/>1.15 ± 0.04 occasions (standard deviation, range 1-3 <lb/>re-matings). Most re-matings occurred only once; how-<lb/>ever, four pairs re-mated three times (i.e. mated four <lb/>times). Re-mating events generally occurred in consec-<lb/>utive years, but some occurred as much as 5 years after <lb/>the original mating. <lb/></body>

			<body>As a consequence of re-mating, the average full-<lb/>sibship size was above one in both the observed data <lb/>and all simulations.

Further, the ratio of different males a female <lb/>mated with to the number of calves she produced was <lb/>also significantly lower in the observed pedigree than <lb/>in any simulated pedigree (see Table 2). <lb/>Intralineage polygyny <lb/>Males mated with females from the same matriline <lb/>significantly more in the observed population than <lb/>expected from any of the simulated pedigrees: the ratio <lb/>of different females a male mated with to the number <lb/>of different matrilines those females belonged to was <lb/>significantly lower in the observed pedigree (see <lb/>Table 2, Fig. 3 and see Fig. 1 for an example) than in <lb/>any simulated pedigree. <lb/>Relatedness <lb/>On average, pairs of individuals in the observed <lb/>pedigree were significantly more related than expected <lb/>under random mating: pairwise relatedness was signifi-<lb/>cantly higher in the observed pedigree than under any <lb/>simulation (see Table 3, Fig. 4).

			<body>Inbreeding <lb/>Average inbreeding coefficients were significantly <lb/>higher in the observed pedigree than in any simulated <lb/>pedigree (see Table 4, Fig. 5). In addition, the total <lb/>number of nonzero inbreeding coefficients was signifi-<lb/>cantly higher in the observed pedigree than in any of <lb/>the simulations (Table 4). We inspected whether this <lb/>effect was driven by close inbreeding events by deter-<lb/>mining whether it remained on considering only highly <lb/>inbred individuals (f ! 0.125), but it did not: the <lb/>observed pedigree did not have significantly more close <lb/>inbreeding events than in the &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;, &apos;Spatial <lb/>500 m&apos; or &apos;BS-corrected&apos; simulations and the differ-<lb/>ences between the observed pedigree and the &apos;Tempo-<lb/>ral&apos; and &apos;Age-corrected&apos; simulations in the number of <lb/>close inbreeding events were not significant after <lb/>Bonferroni correction (see Table 4, Bonferroni signifi-<lb/>cance level P = 0.003). This suggests that the increase <lb/>in average inbreeding coefficients and total number of <lb/>inbreeding events in the observed pedigree compared <lb/>to the simulations resulted more from deep inbreeding <lb/>events (inbreeding between distant relatives) than close <lb/>inbreeding events. One route by which additional <lb/>inbreeding events occur is through intralineage poly-<lb/>gyny, exemplified by the pedigree in Fig. 6.

			<body>of close inbreeding events in the &apos;Temporal&apos;, &apos;Spatial <lb/>100 m&apos; and &apos;Spatial 500 m&apos; simulations revealed that <lb/>many of the close inbreeding events in these simula-<lb/>tions consisted of mating events between mothers and <lb/>sons, or half-sibs, in which the males were &lt; 5 years <lb/>old. These matings, although possible, are unlikely and <lb/>probably the result of immature males not yet having <lb/>fully dispersed from the natal group. Therefore, these <lb/>estimates of close inbreeding coefficients in these simu-<lb/>lations are inflated by these unlikely pairings, and so <lb/>the comparison with the observed pedigree is a conser-<lb/>vative one. <lb/>Genetic structuring of the male population <lb/>We found that the location of rutting males was non-<lb/>random with respect to relatedness, so that more clo-<lb/>sely related males were more likely to rut in the same <lb/>location: there was a significant negative correlation <lb/>between male pairwise relatedness coefficients and the <lb/>pairwise spatial separation (Effect = À1664, F 1,174434.4 = <lb/>159.23, P &lt; 0.001; variance explained by first male <lb/>identity = 217471 ± 12687 and by second male iden-<lb/>tity = 119852 ± 4583, see Fig. 7). Note that this analy-<lb/>sis is cross-generational; therefore, related males were <lb/>more likely to rut in the same location regardless of <lb/>whether they rutted in the same year. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we have demonstrated that a fifth of red <lb/>deer females mate with the same male across multiple <lb/>breeding attempts and that members of the same matri-<lb/>line frequently mate with the same male as one <lb/>another; in both cases, these events happen more than <lb/>would be expected under random mating. The observed <lb/>distribution of matings was associated with a general <lb/>increase in relatedness across the population compared <lb/>to that expected under random mating, and also an <lb/>increase in inbreeding. It should be noted that, like <lb/>nearly all wild studies, our estimates of inbreeding are <lb/>likely to be conservative, given the assumption that <lb/>founders and immigrants are unrelated, and because <lb/>we cannot assign paternity to all individuals. Although <lb/>this is also true for the simulated mating scenarios, and <lb/>the validity of our conclusions is therefore maintained, <lb/>inbreeding in this population is likely to be even <lb/>greater than described in this study. <lb/>Fig. 3 Intralineage polygyny.

			<body>temporal constraints to mating, spatial constraints to <lb/>mating and a lifetime breeding success-adjusted proba-<lb/>bility of males gaining paternity success (&apos;BS-corrected&apos;) <lb/>most closely predicted observed values in most analyses <lb/>(with the exception of relatedness and average inbreed-<lb/>ing coefficients, in which the &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos; was <lb/>closest to the observed value). The &apos;Age-corrected&apos; <lb/>simulation, which incorporated similar levels of <lb/>complexity, but with the probability of gaining pater-<lb/>nity success weighted by male age, was generally also <lb/>more similar to the observed values than the less com-<lb/>plex simulations. This indicates that all of the con-<lb/>straints modelled in the simulations contribute to the <lb/>extent of re-mating and intralineage polygyny which <lb/>we have observed: within-individual, and within-matri-<lb/>line, consistency of individuals in their timing and loca-<lb/>tion of rutting behaviour is likely to be important in <lb/>facilitating re-mating between pairs and probably also <lb/>intralineage polygyny across years. The further <lb/>improvement upon adding lifetime breeding success-or <lb/>age-weighted reproductive probabilities for males prob-<lb/>ably results because most re-mating events happen in <lb/>consecutive years, and males have a peak of reproduc-<lb/>tion which lasts for around 3 years; therefore, if males <lb/>return to the same rutting locations, the male was <lb/>likely to have been dominant in that area for consecu-<lb/>tive years. A similar argument can be applied to intra-<lb/>lineage polygyny, in that female relatives mating in the <lb/>same place in consecutive years will be likely to mate <lb/>with the same male; further, within a year, female rela-<lb/>tives may be more likely to mate with the same male <lb/>because he is the most dominant male in the vicinity. <lb/>Despite this improvement in fit, significant differ-<lb/>ences did remain between simulations and the observed <lb/>pedigree for most parameters, indicating the simulations <lb/>did not capture the full extent of re-mating and <lb/>intralineage polygyny. It therefore seems likely that <lb/>processes not captured by these simulations also affect <lb/>the distribution of mating. Investigation into the factors <lb/>affecting the probability of re-mating (Stopher, 2011) <lb/>suggests that more successful males would be more <lb/>likely to re-mate with the same female. To an extent, <lb/>this will be captured in the &apos;Age-corrected&apos; and &apos;BS-cor-<lb/>rected&apos; scenarios. However, year-specific male breeding <lb/>success will be influenced by other factors including <lb/>environmentally induced variation in antler size and <lb/>condition (Clutton-Brock et al., 1979), as well as socio-<lb/>environmental effects on the distribution of male <lb/>breeding success (Stopher, 2011). Intralineage polygyny <lb/>may result if female relatives are more likely to mate <lb/>with the same male because the close association of <lb/>female relatives means they are likely to be found in <lb/>the same harem, or possibly, because females copy each <lb/>other&apos;s movements or choice of males. Although this <lb/>will be captured to some extent in &apos;Spatial 100 m&apos;, <lb/>during the peak of the rut the area captured by this <lb/>constraint could potentially include a number of har-<lb/>ems. Further, females that associate are known to syn-<lb/>chronize oestrus (Iason &amp; Guinness, 1985, but note this <lb/>was not due to kinship per se), and the 11-day window <lb/>we used as a temporal constraint may be too crude to <lb/>capture this. <lb/>Regardless of the extent to which pair re-mating and <lb/>intralineage polygyny can be explained by the temporal <lb/>and spatial characteristics of the breeding system, these <lb/>trends in the distribution of mating are associated with <lb/>striking effects on the genetic structure of the popula-<lb/>tion. Average relatedness was significantly higher in <lb/>the observed pedigree than in any simulation. Figure 1 <lb/>demonstrates why this should be the case where intra-<lb/>lineage polygyny exists: in this example, the relatedness <lb/>of the two individuals is increased from 0.125 (aunt-<lb/>half-niece) to 0.375, because they also share a father, <lb/>making them half-sibs. Increased relatedness within <lb/>groups may promote cooperation between members of <lb/>the same group (Hamilton, 1963; Griffin &amp; West, 2003; <lb/>Rossiter et al., 2005). Although maternal relatedness <lb/>more commonly affects affiliation and cooperative <lb/>behaviour in mammals, there is some evidence that <lb/>paternal relatedness can also influence the frequency of <lb/>affiliative interactions between group members (Smith <lb/>et al., 2003; Widdig, 2007). However, to our knowl-<lb/>edge, there is as yet no direct evidence that related <lb/>females show a preference for mating with the same <lb/>partner. <lb/>As shown in Fig. 7, the mating behaviours observed <lb/>in this study can also result in increased risk of inbreed-<lb/>ing. We found that average inbreeding coefficients were <lb/>greater in the observed pedigree than under any of the <lb/>random mating scenarios simulated (see Fig. 6). This <lb/>increase was not driven by an increase in close inbreed-<lb/>ing events, as there was no significant difference <lb/>between the observed and expected in all but the <lb/>random mating scenario. Instead, it seems likely <lb/>Fig. 7 Correlation between relatedness and rutting location of <lb/>pairs of males.

			<body>re-mating and intralineage polygyny have contributed <lb/>to increased numbers of &apos;deep&apos; inbreeding events, such <lb/>as that in Fig. 7. Male site fidelity is likely to be impor-<lb/>tant in generating close inbreeding events resulting <lb/>from intralineage polygyny, such as father-daughter <lb/>matings. However, deeper inbreeding events may result <lb/>from male relatives rutting in the same area, particu-<lb/>larly males rutting in the same place as their father, <lb/>that is, within their own natal groups. We have indeed <lb/>found significant genetic structuring in the male popu-<lb/>lation, indicating that male relatives are likely to be rut-<lb/>ting in similar locations. In these cases, the magnitude <lb/>of the inbreeding coefficient can then be inflated by <lb/>intralineage events, as occurs in Fig. 7: a relatively dis-<lb/>tant inbreeding event (aunt-half-nephew) is aug-<lb/>mented by an instance of intralineage polygyny higher <lb/>up the pedigree. In general therefore, it appears a non-<lb/>random distribution of males with respect to related-<lb/>ness, combined with the mating behaviours we have <lb/>described, results in an increase in inbreeding in the <lb/>population over that which would be expected. In <lb/>many lekking species, males have been shown to exhi-<lb/>bit a nonrandom choice of mating sites with respect to <lb/>relatedness (Petrie et al., 1999; Piertney et al., 1999; <lb/>Shorey et al., 2000; Hö glund &amp; Shorey, 2003), and in <lb/>grey seals, Pomeroy et al. (2000) found evidence males <lb/>returned to their natal sites to breed, In lekking species, <lb/>inclusive fitness benefits are generally implicated in <lb/>such behaviour, as females may be preferentially <lb/>attracted to larger leks (Shorey et al., 2000). Given the <lb/>short tenure of breeding males, relatives are unlikely to <lb/>overlap in time as prime-aged individuals and so direct <lb/>competition is rare. Where direct competition occurs, <lb/>potentially, in the red deer system, dominant males <lb/>may be more tolerant of subordinate males near their <lb/>harem if they are related, but this remains to be inves-<lb/>tigated. Together, these factors could explain why, to <lb/>some extent, males return to their natal area to breed, <lb/>despite dispersing as young males. <lb/>Inbreeding is often associated with fitness costs <lb/>(Keller &amp; Waller, 2002). In this population, there is <lb/>substantial inbreeding depression for birth weight and <lb/>first-year survival: a calf with an inbreeding coefficient <lb/>of 0.25 has a 77% reduction in survival compared to <lb/>an outbred calf (Walling et al., 2011). Why therefore do <lb/>inbred matings appear to be tolerated in this popula-<lb/>tion? Although many studies have documented fitness <lb/>costs of inbreeding (reviewed in Keller &amp; Waller, 2002), <lb/>several reviews have argued that inbreeding should be <lb/>tolerated where the costs of inbreeding are not greater <lb/>than the costs of inbreeding avoidance, including costs <lb/>of dispersal, loss of breeding opportunities or costs of <lb/>outbreeding, and that such conditions can be realistic <lb/>(Bateson, 1983; Waser et al., 1986; Kokko &amp; Ots, 2006). <lb/>In particular, much theoretical attention has been paid <lb/>to the idea that inbreeding tolerance can be favoured <lb/>by inclusive fitness benefits (Parker, 1979; Smith, 1979; <lb/>Waser et al., 1986; Kokko &amp; Ots, 2006). The benefits of <lb/>inbreeding in terms of kin selection have been proposed <lb/>to explain preferences for related males as extra-pair <lb/>partners in socially monogamous birds (Kleven et al., <lb/>2005; Wang &amp; Lu, 2011). Inbreeding tolerance is only <lb/>likely to evolve under such conditions (i) if the male <lb/>does not lose other breeding opportunities by mating <lb/>with his kin, which may be true for the red deer system <lb/>in which male reproductive success is likely to be <lb/>mostly limited by the ability to gain access to females, <lb/>rather than time or other ecological constraints; and (ii) <lb/>the cost of incestuous matings on offspring viability <lb/>does not outweigh the inclusive fitness benefits of <lb/>doing so (Smith, 1979; Waser et al., 1986; Kokko &amp; Ots, <lb/>2006). The increase in inbreeding which we have <lb/>observed from that expected occurred due to an <lb/>increase in distant inbreeding events, rather than those <lb/>between close relatives: therefore, the costs of inbreed-<lb/>ing are inevitably reduced. No evidence for inbreeding <lb/>avoidance has been found in a number of other polygy-<lb/>nous systems (Hansson et al., 2007; Holand et al., 2007; <lb/>Rioux-Paquette et al., 2010). It is not clear whether this <lb/>is because there is little selection for post-dispersal <lb/>inbreeding avoidance mechanisms in dispersing species <lb/>(Clutton-Brock &amp; McAuliffe, 2009) or because the (cur-<lb/>rently poorly understood) benefits of inbreeding bal-<lb/>ance, or even outweigh, the costs in such systems. In <lb/>general, it seems the expectation that animals should <lb/>always avoid inbreeding requires further thought, and <lb/>more work remains to be carried out to understand the <lb/>evolution of inbreeding tolerance or avoidance in such <lb/>systems. <lb/>That this study is conducted on an island population <lb/>potentially increases the likelihood of the phenomena <lb/>we have observed: for example, small populations <lb/>restrict the opportunities for mating and therefore <lb/>increase inbreeding risk (Keller &amp; Waller, 2002). How-<lb/>ever, comparison with mainland populations suggests <lb/>that these phenomena may be more widespread. An <lb/>investigation of the dispersal of male and female red <lb/>deer on the Scottish mainland concluded that although <lb/>dispersal was predominantly male-biased, patterns of <lb/>relatedness over geographical distances were similar for <lb/>males and females (Pé rez-Espona et al., 2008). This <lb/>study contrasted with the findings of previous work on <lb/>the Rum population, which showed no spatial genetic <lb/>structuring of the male population outside of the rut <lb/>(Nussey et al., 2005). However, interestingly, males in <lb/>the mainland study were sampled during the hunting <lb/>season (1 July to 20 October), which partly overlaps <lb/>with the rutting period, the period in which our results <lb/>indicate spatial genetic structure amongst males in the <lb/>Rum population. <lb/>In summary, using molecular paternity analysis, we <lb/>have revealed more re-mating between pairs and more <lb/>intralineage polygyny in a population of wild red deer <lb/>than expected. Combined with hitherto unquantified <lb/></body>

			<body>genetic spatial structuring of the rutting male popula-<lb/>tion, challenging the assumption of male-biased <lb/>dispersal in polygynous mammals, these mating behav-<lb/>iours were associated with increased relatedness of indi-<lb/>viduals in the population, but also an increase in <lb/>inbreeding events. Such behaviours are rarely docu-<lb/>mented in wild polygynous mammals, in part because <lb/>of the challenge of collecting sufficient data across gen-<lb/>erations to identify them; yet they are key tests of theo-<lb/>retical concepts of population genetics. In general, the <lb/>combined use of molecular paternity analysis and simu-<lb/>lated pedigrees based on potential mating scenarios has <lb/>revealed further the hidden complexity of this polygy-<lb/>nous mating system, and raised many interesting ques-<lb/>tions for future research: the role of female choice or <lb/>mate copying, the implications for social evolution and <lb/>the extent to which inbreeding should be tolerated or <lb/>avoided in such systems. Identifying, and understand-<lb/>ing, such phenomena in wild populations is also critical <lb/>to wider areas of research: for example, estimates of <lb/>quantitative genetic parameters, such as trait heritabili-<lb/>ties, may be confounded by inflated relatedness <lb/>amongst closely spatially associated individuals. <lb/></body>
