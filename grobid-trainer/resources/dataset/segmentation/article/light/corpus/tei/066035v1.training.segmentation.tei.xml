			<body>Introduction: <lb/>Multispecies microbial communities (microbiomes) influence animal biology in <lb/>diverse ways (1): microbiomes modulate disease (2), metabolize nutrients (3), <lb/>synthesize vitamins (4), and modify behavior (5). A central goal in host-microbiome <lb/>studies is to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning these diverse <lb/>microbiome functions. <lb/>Some aspects of microbial community function are the product of interspecies <lb/>interactions (6-9). For example, microorganisms modulate the metabolomes of <lb/>neighboring species (10) and microbial metabolites (e.g., antibiotics) alter bacterial <lb/>transcriptional responses (11). Despite current understanding of microbial inter-species <lb/>interactions in vitro, some of which has been elucidated in exquisite detail, the <lb/>consequences of microbial interspecies interactions within host-associated microbiomes <lb/>are just beginning to be explored experimentally. <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>Insight into host-associated microbiome function has stemmed mostly from <lb/>whole-microbiome (e.g., re-association of germ-free hosts with whole microbiomes (12)) <lb/>and modeling microbiome function based on gene annotation (13) or single-<lb/>microorganism (e.g., re-association of germ-free hosts with a single microorganism <lb/>(14)) studies. However, these approaches tend to reveal only limited insight into <lb/>interspecies microbial interactions, which can provide hosts with essential services. For <lb/>example, termite symbionts carry genes necessary for metabolism of different parts of <lb/>complex carbohydrates (15), yet their function has not been demonstrated in vivo; co-<lb/>occurring human gut symbionts share polysaccharide breakdown products <lb/>cooperatively (16, 17), but the consequences of such interactions for the host are <lb/>unknown; inter-species bacterial interactions protect Hydra from fungal infection (18), <lb/>but the mechanism of host protection is unclear. The need to understand the effects of <lb/>inter-species microbiome interactions motivated our current work. <lb/>Attractive model systems in which to study the outcomes of inter-species <lb/>microbial interactions for host biology would include a tractable host that harbors a <lb/>simple multispecies microbiome. Here, we report the use of Drosophila melanogaster to <lb/>study interactions in a simple microbiome and their consequences for host behavior. <lb/>The Drosophila microbiome consists largely of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and <lb/>lactic acid bacteria (19-22). Drosophila ingests microbiome members from the <lb/>environment (e.g., fermenting fruit, (22-26)), a behavior posited as a mechanism for <lb/>Drosophila to select, acquire, and maintain its microbiome (21, 25). Drosophila behavior <lb/>toward environmental microorganisms has focused on yeasts (27-31). While yeasts <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>attract Drosophila via ester production (28, 29), lactic and acetic acid bacteria produce <lb/>metabolites (e.g., acids) that may repel Drosophila, based on olfactory avoidance of <lb/>high acid concentrations (32). One motivation of our study was to analyze Drosophila <lb/>behavior toward the yeast and bacteria that dominate the Drosophila microbiome. <lb/>Yeast and bacteria are largely studied within separate Drosophila sub-disciplines, <lb/>despite their shared habitat (21). Yeasts serve as food, providing Drosophila vitamins, <lb/>sterols, and amino acids (21). Lactic and acetic acid bacteria are gut microbiome <lb/>members (33) promoting larval development (34, 35), increasing resistance to <lb/>pathogens (25), inducing intestinal stem cell proliferation (36), and reducing adult sugar <lb/>and lipid levels (37, 38). Since microorganisms that are traditionally considered &apos;food&apos; <lb/>co-exist with those considered &quot;microbiome&apos; in fruit fermentations and the two groups <lb/>provide Drosophila with different services, we hypothesized that Drosophila might detect <lb/>a beneficial community via metabolites that are produced cooperatively by the desirable <lb/>symbionts. Alternatively, Drosophila might detect a different metabolite as the signal for <lb/>each symbiont. <lb/>Fruit undergoes a well-characterized ripening process in which cell-wall <lb/>degrading enzymes and amylases convert the firm, starchy tissue into soft, sugar-rich <lb/>fruit (39-41). The high sugar content supports microbial colonization and fermentation <lb/>by Drosophila-associated microorganisms, including yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and <lb/>acetic acid bacteria (23, 42). Drosophila avoids &apos;green&apos; fruit and is attracted to &apos;overripe&apos; <lb/>fruit (43), yet it is unclear whether Drosophila behavior is influenced by the fruit <lb/>microbiome and its metabolic properties. To this end, we developed a model fruit <lb/></body>

			<body>fermentation system that afforded measurement of microbial populations, microbial <lb/>metabolites, and Drosophila behavior. <lb/>Here we demonstrate the importance of emergent microbiome metabolism-<lb/>quantitatively different or unique metabolites produced by the microbiome, but not by <lb/>any of its members in isolation-on behavior, suggesting that Drosophila modulates its <lb/>chemical intake by selecting a beneficial microbiome. <lb/>Results: <lb/>To determine whether Drosophila responds to emergent microbial community <lb/>metabolites, we used the T-maze olfactory assay to analyze Drosophila behavioral <lb/>responses to several Drosophila microbiome members grown individually or in <lb/>communities (Figure 1A, Table S1, Figure 1-figure supplement 1). When the strains <lb/>were grown individually, Drosophila was strongly attracted to yeasts, moderately <lb/>attracted to acetic acid bacteria, and neutral or slightly repelled by lactic acid bacteria <lb/>(Figure 1B, C). Because strains within a microbial group attracted Drosophila similarly, a <lb/>representative yeast, acetic acid bacterium, and lactic acid bacterium were used to test <lb/>the effect of interactions between microbiome members on Drosophila behavior. <lb/>Drosophila preferred microbial communities grown together to microorganisms grown <lb/>individually and then mixed prior to analysis (defined throughout as a separate-culture <lb/>mixture, Figure 1D). Focusing on a model Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Acetobacter <lb/>malorum community, we found that when tested against apple juice medium (AJM), <lb/>Drosophila preferred the community to the separate-culture mixture or individual <lb/></body>

			<body>members (Figure 1E). In sum, Drosophila detects, and prefers, microorganisms growing <lb/>together to a mixture of the same strains combined after they had completed growth. <lb/>We next measured the attractiveness and other properties of the co-culture over <lb/>time. When grown alone, the microorganisms had similar growth profiles (Figure 2A). <lb/>However, when grown with A. malorum, S. cerevisiae populations first increased, then <lb/>decreased between 60 and 72 h, and were undetectable by 96 h (Figure 2A). The <lb/>decrease in S. cerevisiae viable counts mirrored a decrease in pH (Figure 2-figure <lb/>supplement 1A). Drosophila did not prefer the co-culture relative to the separate-culture <lb/>mixture at 34 h, slightly preferred the co-culture at 48 and 54 h, and strongly preferred <lb/>the co-culture at 60 through 96 h (Figure 2B). Drosophila preference for the co-culture <lb/>correlated with lower pH and S. cerevisiae populations, despite Drosophila olfactory <lb/>avoidance of acid (32) and reliance on yeast for nutrition (44) (Figure 2C, D). Drosophila <lb/>preference did not correlate with viable A. malorum populations (Figure 2-figure <lb/>supplement 1B). Drosophila preference for the co-culture increased relative to sterile <lb/>media during 34-96 h of growth, which is consistent with the increase in Drosophila <lb/>attraction being due to a property of the co-culture rather than to a decrease in <lb/>attraction to the separate-culture mixture (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C). In sum, <lb/>several properties of the microbial community (e.g. S. cerevisiae density, pH) parallel <lb/>Drosophila detection of, and preference for, the co-culture. <lb/>Mutants in broadly and narrowly tuned ionotropic and olfactory receptors (Irs and <lb/>Ors, respectively, (45, 46)) were used to evaluate the role of Drosophila olfactory <lb/>reception in discriminating the co-culture from the separate-culture mixture during and <lb/></body>

			<body>immediately following peak attraction (Figure 3-figure supplement 1). During the most <lb/>attractive phase of the co-culture (e.g. 67-115 h), Or83b and Or42b showed significant <lb/>attraction to the co-culture, whereas no role was detected for Irs or Or35a (Figure 3). As <lb/>the co-culture proceeded (e.g. 139-163 h), attraction decreased and the role of Or42b <lb/>and Or83b waned (Figure 3). Or83b is a required co-receptor for all other Or gene <lb/>products (47) and Or42b, one of the most conserved olfactory receptors, detects esters <lb/>and 1,1-diethoxyethane (48-50).These results suggest that Or42b enables Drosophila to <lb/>distinguish the co-culture from the separate-culture mixture. Our results suggest that a <lb/>non-Or83b factor explains ~40% of Drosophila co-culture preference (Figure 3). <lb/>Previous work found that Or83b is fully responsible for Drosophila attraction to apple <lb/>cider vinegar (51), suggesting that the behavioral circuit activated by inter-species <lb/>interactions of the co-culture is distinct from the circuit activated by apple cider vinegar. <lb/>We speculated that the emergent property of co-culture attractiveness might <lb/>arise from a distinct metabolic profile of the co-culture. Using gas chromatography-mass <lb/>spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified volatiles unique to or differentially produced in the <lb/>co-culture compared to the separate-culture mixture. Five co-culture volatiles (ethanol, <lb/>isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, acetic acid, isoamyl acetate) were confirmed with standards <lb/>(Table 1-figure supplements 1-2) and quantified with standard curves (Table 1-figure <lb/>supplement 3). The alcohol concentrations were lower, and acetic acid and isoamyl <lb/>acetate were unique in the co-culture relative to the other experimental groups (Table <lb/>1). The molecular profile was reminiscent of ethanol catabolism as the unique co-culture <lb/></body>

			<body>metabolic process. We therefore hypothesized that ethanol catabolism was the <lb/>emergent metabolic process. <lb/>We next measured ethanol and acetic acid levels over time (24-156 h) and <lb/>compared the chemical dynamics to Drosophila preference. Consistent with a <lb/>relationship between ethanol catabolism, acetic acid anabolism, and Drosophila <lb/>attraction, ethanol levels declined and acetic acid accumulated in the co-culture at a <lb/>similar time of Drosophila co-culture preference (Figure 4A). Furthermore, as ethanol <lb/>catabolism and acetic acid anabolism proceeded (36-96 h), Drosophila attraction toward <lb/>the co-culture increased until 96 h, at which point it decreased, consistent with lower <lb/>turnover of ethanol at the end of ethanol catabolism (Figure 4A, black line). <lb/>We hypothesized that Drosophila preferred the community during peak ethanol <lb/>turnover (e.g. co-cultures at ~72 h of growth) compared with the community pre-ethanol <lb/>catabolism (e.g. co-culture at ~36 h of growth) or during late-stage ethanol catabolism, <lb/>in which ethanol turnover is low (e.g. co-culture at ~144 h of growth; Figure 4A). <lb/>Consistent with our hypothesis, Drosophila preferred the co-culture in the middle stage <lb/>of ethanol catabolism to earlier or later stages of ethanol catabolism (Figure 4B). <lb/>We hypothesized that Drosophila preference for communities during peak <lb/>ethanol turnover reflected fitness benefits derived from ingesting metabolites associated <lb/>with different staged communities. To test this hypothesis, we measured Drosophila <lb/>survival when given ethanol and acetic acid concentrations characteristic of microbial <lb/>cultures at different stages of ethanol catabolism. Drosophila survival was highest when <lb/>given metabolites associated with middle-staged ethanol catabolism compared with pre-<lb/></body>

			<body>or end-stage ethanol catabolism (Figure 4C). In sum, our results are consistent with <lb/>Drosophila preference providing benefits associated with consumption of microbial <lb/>community-generated metabolites. <lb/>To test directly whether ethanol catabolism underpinned Drosophila co-culture <lb/>preference, we evaluated Drosophila preference for the co-culture harboring a mutant in <lb/>adhA, which encodes pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase <lb/>(PQQ-ADH-I), the enzyme that converts yeast-derived ethanol into acetaldehyde on <lb/>path to acetic acid (34). Co-cultures using either A. malorum or A. pomorum wild-type <lb/>(WT) along with S. cerevisiae were equally attractive to Drosophila (Figure 5-figure <lb/>supplement 1). Drosophila preferred the co-culture containing A. pomorum WT versus a <lb/>separate-culture mixture; however, Drosophila did not prefer the co-culture containing <lb/>A. pomorum adhA versus a separate-culture mixture (Figure 5A), suggesting that <lb/>ethanol catabolism is necessary for Drosophila to discriminate between the two <lb/>conditions. Drosophila preferred the co-culture containing A. pomorum WT to the co-<lb/>culture containing A. pomorum adhA (Fig. 5A). Moreover, Drosophila preferred to lay <lb/>eggs in the co-culture containing A. pomorum WT to the co-culture containing A. <lb/>pomorum adhA, further substantiating the importance of ethanol catabolism in <lb/>Drosophila biology, as egg-laying decisions are crucial to reproductive success (Figure <lb/>5B). <lb/>We next identified additional metabolites unique to the co-culture using solid-<lb/>phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS). Acetic <lb/>acid, six acetate esters, an acetaldehyde metabolic derivative (acetoin), a putative <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>acetaldehyde metabolic derivative (2,4,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane), and two unknown <lb/>metabolites were more abundant in the co-culture relative to the separate-culture <lb/>mixture or co-culture with A. pomorum lacking adhA (Table 2, Table 2-figure <lb/>supplements 1-2). To determine the molecular basis for Drosophila co-culture <lb/>preference, select metabolites were added to the co-culture containing A. pomorum <lb/>adhA. Esters and acetic acid, but not esters alone, were sufficient to fully restore A. <lb/>pomorum adhA attractiveness to A. pomorum WT levels (Figure 5A). <lb/>Although acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient for Drosophila co-<lb/>culture preference, acetaldehyde is a reactive intermediate during ethanol catabolism <lb/>whose metabolic derivatives might be increased in microbial communities compared <lb/>with individual microbial cultures. Consistent with this idea, acetoin was moderately <lb/>increased in the co-culture compared with the separate-culture mixture (Table 2-figure <lb/>supplement 1); strikingly, acetoin was increased ~27-fold in the tri-culture (S. cerevisiae, <lb/>A. malorum, and L. plantarum) compared to the co-culture (Figure 6A, B, Figure 6-<lb/>figure supplement 1) and was attractive to Drosophila (Figure 6-figure supplement 2). In <lb/>sum, emergent metabolites from 2-and 3-membered communities, including <lb/>acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives, attract Drosophila. <lb/>To investigate further the potential role of acetaldehyde and its metabolic <lb/>derivatives in Drosophila behavior, we performed a dose response in which <lb/>acetaldehyde was added to the separate-culture mixture (Figure 6-figure supplement <lb/>3A) to evaluate its ability to induce attractiveness to co-culture levels. Even at the lowest <lb/>tested levels, acetaldehyde supplementation stimulated the separate-culture mixture to <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>attractiveness levels equal to the co-culture (Figure 6-figure supplement 3A); moreover, <lb/>acetaldehyde and its metabolic derivatives &apos;over-restored&apos; preference of the separate-<lb/>culture mixture beyond WT co-culture levels at its most attractive dose (Figure 6-figure <lb/>supplement 3A). Finally, three acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives-acetoin, 1,1-<lb/>diethoxyethane (an acetal), and 2,3-butanedione-were sufficient to induce the <lb/>attractiveness of the separate-culture mixture to WT co-culture levels using <lb/>concentrations of each metabolite at or below the physiological concentration of acetoin <lb/>found in the tri-culture (Figure 6-figure supplement 3B). Creating a pure metabolite <lb/>mixture comprised of key metabolic groups produced by microbial communities and <lb/>identified in this study (esters, acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives, alcohols, acid) <lb/>attracted Drosophila similarly to the co-culture (Figure 6-figure supplement 4A, B). <lb/>Interestingly, the acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives alone were sufficient and the most <lb/>attractive (Figure 6-figure supplement 4C, D), supporting acetaldehyde metabolic <lb/>derivatives as potent Drosophila attractants. <lb/>Overall, our results suggest that both esters and acetaldehyde metabolic <lb/>derivatives are keystone microbial community metabolites that attract Drosophila. We <lb/>next created a simple 9-metabolite mixture in water (containing only 1 acid, 4 esters, <lb/>and 4 acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives) and measured Drosophila preference toward <lb/>this mixture in relation to the yeast-acetic acid bacteria co-culture, the yeast-acetic acid <lb/>bacteria-lactic acid bacteria microbial community, or apple cider vinegar (ACV). The <lb/>defined mixture used concentrations for each acetaldehyde metabolic derivative similar <lb/>to the concentration of acetoin in the tri-culture and ester and acid concentrations that <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>were in the range of detected in the co-culture. The defined 9-metabolite mixture was <lb/>more attractive than all other conditions (Figure 6-figure supplement 5). In sum, <lb/>acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives and esters are potent Drosophila attractants whose <lb/>detection may signal the presence of actively metabolizing, multispecies microbial <lb/>communities. <lb/>Discussion: <lb/>Here, we have demonstrated how emergent properties of a microbial <lb/>community-volatile profile, population dynamics, and pH-influence Drosophila <lb/>attraction, survival, and egg-laying behaviors. Our study is the first to identify the <lb/>consequences of microbe-microbe metabolic exchange on animal behavior and <lb/>discovers additional microbial interactions for further mechanistic study (Figure 1D). <lb/>Microbe-microbe metabolic exchange generates unique and quantitatively <lb/>different volatiles from those resulting from individual microbial metabolism (Tables 1 &amp; <lb/>2, Figure 7). Acetobacter-generated acetate coupled to Saccharomyces-derived <lb/>alcohols spawn diverse acetate esters (Table 1 &amp; Table 2). We hypothesize that more <lb/>complex and diverse communities, comprising alcohol-producing yeasts, acetate-<lb/>producing Acetobacter, and lactate-producing Lactobacillus, will generate a wider array <lb/>of attractive esters (Figure 7). The community of S. cerevisiae, A. malorum, and L. <lb/>plantarum emitted higher levels of acetoin and attracted Drosophila more strongly than <lb/>the co-culture of S. cerevisiae and A. malorum (Figure 1D, Figure 6). Acetoin and 2,3-<lb/>butanedione are formed by an α-acetolactate intermediate in bacteria and directly from <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>acetaldehyde in yeast (52). We therefore hypothesize that communities of yeasts and <lb/>bacteria may emit high levels of attractive acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives (Figure <lb/>7). <lb/>Drosophila behavioral studies have mostly focused on yeasts, even though <lb/>Drosophila evolved in a bacterial-rich environment. Our results suggest that non-yeast <lb/>microorganisms, especially when grown in microbial communities, affect Drosophila <lb/>behaviors. We reason that additional investigations that couple chemical microbial <lb/>ecology with Drosophila behavior will herald the discovery of microbe-influenced <lb/>behaviors and microbial community-generated metabolites. <lb/>This study demonstrates the coordination of ethanol synthesis and catabolism by <lb/>S. cerevisiae and Acetobacter, respectively, and the role of ethanol in Drosophila <lb/>behavior and survival. Non-Saccharomyces Drosophila microbiome members also <lb/>make ethanol (53) and diverse acetic acid bacteria catabolize ethanol, generalizing our <lb/>findings to other microbial community combinations. Ethanol can have deleterious or <lb/>beneficial fitness consequences for Drosophila depending on concentration (54, 55) and <lb/>ecological context (56). Our results show that Drosophila uses products of inter-species <lb/>microbiome metabolism to detect a community that titrates ethanol concentration <lb/>optimally for the host. Work that further dissects the consequences of acetic acid and <lb/>ethanol concentrations on Drosophila biology and investigates other community-level <lb/>metabolic profiles will be of interest to enrich the chemical and ecological portrait of the <lb/>Drosophila microbiome. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Our work raises questions about the consequences of the observed behavior on <lb/>microbiome assembly and stability in the Drosophila intestine. Drosophila possesses <lb/>specific and regionalized gut immune responses to the microbiome (57-60) implying a <lb/>tolerant environment in which privileged microbiome members are maintained and <lb/>reproduce in the Drosophila intestine. Other work suggests that Drosophila acquires its <lb/>adult microbiome from exogenous sources, that adult microbiome abundance drops <lb/>without continuous ingestion of exogenous microorganisms, and that the microbiome <lb/>can be shaped by diet (19, 25, 26). As such, a combination of internal mechanisms, <lb/>exogenous factors, and host behavior likely sculpt the microbiome; determining the <lb/>relative contribution of each will be important moving forward. Complicating our <lb/>understanding of the contribution of these factors is the opaque distinction between <lb/>&apos;microbiome&apos; and &apos;food&apos;, since both are ingested from the environment (61). To dissect <lb/>the formation and stability of the Drosophila microbiome, the fate of ingested <lb/>microorganisms needs to be monitored and microbial intestinal reproduction needs to <lb/>be surveyed as a function of Drosophila behavior, age, immune status, microbiome <lb/>membership, and nutritional state (e.g. using synthetic diets without yeast; (34, 62)). <lb/>In sum, our results support a model in which the Drosophila olfactory system is <lb/>tuned to fruity (e.g., esters) and buttery (several acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives, <lb/>such as 2,3-butanedione) smelling metabolites promoted by microbe-microbe <lb/>interactions. We anticipate that accounting for microbial interactions in diverse host-<lb/>microbe studies will lead to new insights into diverse aspects of microbial-animal <lb/>symbioses. <lb/></body>

			<body>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Fly maintenance <lb/>Fly stocks, genotypes, and sources are listed in Methods Table 1. Drosophila melanogaster was reared at <lb/>25°C on a 12h:12h light: dark cycle on autoclaved food (5% yeast, 10% dextrose, 7% cornmeal, 0.6% <lb/>propionic acid, 0.7% agar). <lb/>Microbial strains <lb/>Microorganisms used in this study are listed and described in table S1. Microorganisms were streaked <lb/>onto yeast-peptone dextrose (YPD; 1% yeast extract (Becton Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, <lb/>NJ, USA), 2% peptone (Becton Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 2% dextrose <lb/>(Avantor Performance Materials, Center Valley, PA, USA)) or Man, de Rosa, Sharpe (MRS, Fisher <lb/>Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) plates from a freezer stock. <lb/>T-maze olfactory attraction assays <lb/>The T-maze apparatus was a kind gift of the Carlson Laboratory. Flies were wet-starved for 15-26 hours <lb/>prior to T-maze olfactory experiments by placing flies into vials containing Kimwipes (Kimberly Clark, <lb/>Dallas, TX, USA) soaked with 2 mL of milliQ water. Flies were collected within 4 days (&lt;65 flies per vial) <lb/>of emergence and matured on autoclaved food. Flies between 3 and 10 days-old were used in <lb/>experiments. <lb/>Single microbial colonies were picked from rich media (MRS and YPD) plates and grown overnight. <lb/>Cultures were washed 1X in PBS, diluted 100-fold, and 10µl was aliquoted into 3mL of apple juice media <lb/>(AJM, apple juice (Martinelli&apos;s Gold Medal, Watsonville, CA, USA), pH adjusted to 5.3 with 5M NaOH, with <lb/>0.5% yeast extract). Media was filtered with a 0.22 µM-size pore attached to a 250-mL polystyrene bottle <lb/>(Corning, NY, USA). For co-culture experiments, 1e3-1e5 CFU of each microorganism was placed <lb/>simultaneously into AJM. Microorganisms were grown in 14-mL round bottom polypropylene tubes <lb/>(Corning Science, Tamaulipas, Mexico) at 28°C, 200rpm for the time noted in individual experiments. The <lb/></body>

			<body>microbial culture was diluted 1:1 with sterile milliQ water (0.22 µM filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)) <lb/>and placed directly onto autoclaved 10 mM round Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare Life Science, <lb/>Pittsburgh, PA, USA) placed near the bottom of 15mL CentriStar centrifuge tubes (Corning, NY). A total <lb/>volume of 10 µl was used for all experiments. <lb/>Tubes containing microorganisms and Drosophila were placed into the behavioral room (20-25°C, 50-<lb/>70% humidity maintained by a humidifier (Sunbeam Tower Humidifier, Boca Raton, FL, USA) and <lb/>equilibrated for 10 minutes prior to the beginning of the experiment. Flies (~40-130) were knocked into the <lb/>T-maze apparatus, rested for ~1 min, and then allowed to choose from the test and control arms for 2 min <lb/>in the dark. The test arm was alternated from one side of the apparatus to the other every experimental <lb/>replicate. A Response Index (RI) was computed to analyze preference for the test arm (flies in test arm-<lb/>flies in control arm)/(total flies). <lb/>Chemicals <lb/>Chemicals can be found in Methods table 2. <lb/>Microbial populations and pH <lb/>Selective plates were used to distinguish S. cerevisiae from A. malorum. MRS containing 50 µg/mL <lb/>cycloheximide selected for A. malorum while MRS containing 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 20 µg/mL <lb/>tetracycline selected for S. cerevisiae. pH of filtered cultures (0.22 µM) was measured using a Beckman <lb/>Coulter pH meter (Model Phi510, Fullerton, CA, USA). <lb/>Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry <lb/>Microbial samples were grown in AJM for a specified amount of time in 14-mL round bottom tubes fitted <lb/>with an autoclaved tissue strainer (250 µM nylon mesh (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Grand Island, NY) <lb/>holding between 0.03 and 0.05 grams of autoclaved Amberlite XAD-4 resin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, <lb/>USA) prewashed in water and methanol. After microbial growth, XAD-4 from two cultures was dumped <lb/></body>

			<page>43 <lb/></page>

			<body>into an autoclaved glass vial. XAD-4 was swirled with 900µl methanol for 30 seconds. 500-750µl of <lb/>methanol was removed for GC-MS analysis. Quantification for table S2 was derived from beads <lb/>suspended above the cultures from 84-96 h of growth. Quantification for Fig. 2D was derived from beads <lb/>suspended above the culture every 12 h; time points on the graph refer to the end point of the 12-h span <lb/>(e.g. 84 h corresponds to beads suspended from 72-84 h of growth). <lb/>Samples (5 µl of methanol-extracted samples) were injected into the GC-MS (Agilent 7890A/5975C) at <lb/>250 °C using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL per minute (column head pressure 13 psi). <lb/>The following chromatography temperature program was used for experiments to initially identify <lb/>metabolites in the co-culture and individually grown microorganisms: 40°C for 3 min ramped at 1.7°C per <lb/>minute to 200 °C (held for 3 min) then to 220°C at 3 °C per min and held for a further 5 min. The total run <lb/>time was 111.78 min. For experiments focused on the five major metabolites, a shorter program was used <lb/>that maintained the same first 10 min of the previous method (all 5 volatiles eluted within 9 min). The <lb/>chromatography temperature program was 40°C for 3 min, ramped at 1.7°C per min to 46.8°C and held <lb/>for 3 min, then ramped at 60°C per min until 220°C and held for 5 min. The total run time was 17.9 min. <lb/>The mass spectrometer was run in electron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The temperatures of the transfer <lb/>line, quadrupole, and ionization source were 220°C, 180°C, and 230°C respectively. The ionization was <lb/>off during the first 4 min to avoid solvent overloading with a source temperature of 230°C. Mass spectra <lb/>were recorded in the range of 35-300 m/z. Full scan mode was used at a scan rate of 6 scans/sec. The <lb/>electron multiplier voltage was set in the relative mode to autotune procedure. <lb/>In the initial experiments peaks were manually picked using Agilent Chemstation Software. Volatiles <lb/>associated with peaks were searched against the National Institute of Standards (NIST) 11 database. <lb/>Subsequent experiments focused on the 5 major volatiles identified in the initial experiments by <lb/>performing extracted ion chromatograms using an ion that successfully identified a standard at a specific <lb/>retention time. Quantification was performed by tabulating the maximum abundance of the ion at a <lb/></body>

Live cultures were <lb/>transferred to autoclaved glass vials (20 mL, 23 X 75 mm, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with screw caps <lb/>(18mm, 35 Shore A, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) after growing for 72 h. <lb/>The glass vials containing live microbial cultures were analyzed via a 50/30μm <lb/>carboxen/divinylbenzene/polydimethylsiloxane Stableflex solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber. The <lb/>extraction methodology was based on previous studies using SPME to extract volatiles form vinegars (65, <lb/>66). The syringe was inserted through the membrane of the caps and sampled the volatiles for 30 min at <lb/>45°C; subsequently, metabolites were desorbed for 30 sec at 240C and baked for an additional 4.5 min in <lb/>the injection port. The gas chromatograph was fitted with a microchannel plate (MCP) detector. The <lb/>temperature program of the column was as follows: 40°C for 5 min, 2°C a min for 17.5 min followed by <lb/>25°C a min for 10 min. A final hold time of 5 min at 325°C was used. The carrier gas was helium. A split <lb/>ratio of 250 was used based on better peak resolution. An internal standard of cineole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. <lb/>Louis, MO, USA) was run with each sample and used to compute relative abundances. The mass <lb/>detector was in the range of 40 to 650 m/z. <lb/>To analyze the data, MassLynx software was used. The response threshold was set to an absolute area <lb/>of 10.00. The software automatically picked out peaks and computed peak areas. To obtain a relative <lb/>quantification, peaks were compared across samples and normalized to the internal standard. Peaks <lb/>were first searched against the NIST5 database to identify potential hits. Most potential metabolites were <lb/>confirmed by a standard mixture in 50% AJM. The standard mixtures are in Methods Table 3. <lb/></body>

For the physiological concentrations of acetate-derived metabolites, <lb/>concentrations were added as in table S3 and then mixed 1:1 with water prior to behavioral analysis. For <lb/>the acetaldehyde metabolic derivatives chemical complementation group, a 1:1 mixture of the mutant co-<lb/>culture: water was supplemented with 1,1-diethoxyethane, 2,3-butanedione, and acetoin at final <lb/>concentrations of 0.01%, 0.15% and 0.15%, respectively and used immediately in the T-maze. Acetic <lb/>acid and/or acetaldehyde were added to the culture, allowed to sit at RT for 35 min, mixed 1:1 with water <lb/>and then placed into the T-maze vials. <lb/>Standard curves were used to calculate the concentrations of individual metabolites (fig. S10). The <lb/>standard curves were generated on 2 separate experiments in which 3 concentrations of each standard <lb/>was used. The concentrations of the metabolites were independently calculated from the standard curve <lb/>equations generated on the two separate days.

The test and control sides were alternated for each replicate. Drosophila aged 4-10 <lb/>days (n=50-100) was allowed to lay eggs for 8 h. After the assay, the number of eggs on deposited on <lb/>each choice was tabulated and an egg-laying index was computed analogously to the olfactory response <lb/>index. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>Data analysis was performed in Prismv6.0b.
