While participating in these meetings <lb/>can have a positive impact on daily medical practice, attendance may result in reduced medical <lb/>staffing during the meeting dates. We sought to examine whether there were differences in mortality <lb/>after trauma among patients admitted to the hospital during, before, and after meeting dates. Using <lb/>the Japan Trauma Data Bank, we analyzed in-hospital mortality in patients with traumatic injury <lb/>admitted to the hospital from 2004 to 2015 during the dates of two national academic meetings -the <lb/>Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) and the Japanese Association for the Surgery of <lb/>Trauma (JAST). We compared the data with that of patients admitted with trauma during identical <lb/>weekdays in the weeks before and after the meetings, respectively. We used multiple logistic <lb/>regression analysis to compare outcomes among the three groups. A total of 7,491 patients were <lb/>included in our analyses, with 2,481, 2,492, and 2,518 patients in the during, before, and after <lb/>meeting dates groups, respectively; their mortality rates were 7.3%, 8.0%, and 8.5%, respectively. <lb/>After adjusting for covariates, no significant differences in in-hospital mortality were found among <lb/>the three groups (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] of the before meeting dates and after meeting dates <lb/>groups; 1.18 [0.89-1.56] and 1.23 [0.93-1.63], respectively, with the during meeting dates group as <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Appropriate medical staffing is essential to provide optimal trauma care [1]. Weekend or off-hours <lb/>admission has been shown to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with acute myocardial <lb/>infarction (AMI), stroke, pulmonary embolism, or those who required emergency general surgery <lb/>and were admitted to the intensive care unit [2-6]. This so-called &quot;weekend effect&quot; could possibly be <lb/>explained by reduced medical staffing and resources [7, 8]. <lb/>This &quot;national meeting effect&quot; has been examined in recent years [9-12]. Each year, many <lb/>physicians attend national academic meetings and conferences to present their work, gain new <lb/>knowledge, and network. Although hospitals aim to consistently deliver high quality patient care <lb/>through efficient allocation of staff physicians, medical staffing during national meetings dates may <lb/>be lower than that during non-meeting dates. The &quot;national meeting effect&quot; in Japan has been <lb/>investigated; no significant differences were observed in outcomes among patients hospitalized with <lb/></body>

			<body>AMI or cardiac arrest between meeting dates and non-meeting dates [9, 10]. Interestingly, lower 30-<lb/>day mortality was found among high-risk patients with AMI, cardiac arrest, and heart failure in <lb/>teaching hospitals in the United States during national cardiology meeting dates [11, 12]. <lb/>Although a &quot;weekend effect&quot; in terms of mortality has not been detected [13-15], longer emergency <lb/>department stay and increased risk for missed injuries have been demonstrated for trauma patients <lb/>admitted during off-hours in a community hospital setting [16]. To our knowledge, the &quot;national <lb/>meeting effect&quot; among trauma patients has never been well elucidated. We hypothesized that <lb/>hospital mortality would be higher during the meeting dates of national scientific emergency <lb/>medicine and trauma surgery professional organizations than non-meeting dates and hospital <lb/>mortality would be lower after the meeting dates than before the meeting dates because of reduced <lb/>staffing and the positive impact of the academic meeting on high physician performance. Our <lb/>study&apos;s aim was to compare hospital mortality after trauma among patients admitted during, before, <lb/>and after national meeting dates. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and methods <lb/>Study design and data sources <lb/>This study was designed as a nationwide retrospective cohort study. We used data from the Japan <lb/>Trauma Data Bank (JTDB), which was established in 2003 with the Committee for Clinical Care <lb/>Evaluation of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Trauma Surgery Committee of <lb/>the Japanese Association for the Surgery of Trauma (JAST). Patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale <lb/>(AIS) scores of 3 or above are recorded in the database from 264 Japanese hospitals participating in <lb/>trauma research and care [17]. The registry database contains patient demographics, mechanism of <lb/>injury, vital signs at the scene and on arrival, admission date, AIS scores, Injury Severity Score <lb/>(ISS), treatments, and survival status at discharge from hospitals. The Okayama University Hospital <lb/>ethical committee approved the study (ID 1805-020). Since patient data was extracted anonymously, <lb/>the requirement for informed consent was waived. <lb/>Study sample <lb/>We obtained annual national meeting dates of two academic organizations -the Japanese Association <lb/>for Acute Medicine (JAAM) and JAST -from 2004 to 2015. The during meeting dates group included <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>patients admitted after traumatic injury during the dates of these meetings. The before and after <lb/>meeting dates groups were defined as patients admitted with trauma during the same weekdays in the <lb/>weeks before and after the meetings, respectively [9, 10]. The JAAM and JAST meetings are each <lb/>usually held for two or three consecutive days. For example, the 2015 JAAM meeting was held from <lb/>Wednesday, October 21 through Friday, October 23; the before and after meeting dates groups <lb/>included patients admitted Wednesday through Friday in the weeks before and after the meeting, <lb/>respectively. In this study, patients who were 16 years of age or older admitted with traumatic injury <lb/>from 2004 to 2015 were enrolled. Patients in cardiac arrest at the scene or on arrival and those without <lb/>age, hospital arrival date, and in-hospital mortality data were excluded. <lb/>Outcome measures <lb/>Our primary outcome was post-trauma in-hospital mortality from all causes among patients <lb/>hospitalized during, before, and after national meeting dates. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Comparisons among the three groups were made using the chi-square test for categorical variables <lb/>and analysis of variance for continuous variables. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to <lb/>compare outcomes between the three groups, with the during meeting dates group as the reference <lb/>category. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained after <lb/>adjusting for age (16-39 vs. 40-64 vs. 65≤); gender; mechanism of injury (blunt or others); transfer <lb/>from outside hospitals; ISS (≤8 vs. 9-15 vs. 90mmHg≤ on arrival); Glasgow Coma Scale score (≤8 <lb/>vs. 9-15); presence or absence of emergency surgical or hemostatic intervention (craniotomy, <lb/>thoracotomy, laparotomy, or angioembolization); and type of institution (high vs. low volume <lb/>centers). Because outcomes would be better at the high-volume centers, an additional analysis was <lb/>conducted by dividing the patients into two groups; high volume centers (≥1,200 cases with ISS≥9 <lb/>registered for 12 years) and low volume centers (&lt;1,200 cases with ISS≥9 registered for 12 years) <lb/>[18]. A subgroup analysis was also conducted, stratifying patients with or without shock and the type <lb/>of national meeting. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using alternative definitions of the before <lb/>and after meeting dates groups; two, three, and four weeks before and two, three, and four weeks <lb/>after meeting dates, respectively, instead of one week. A two-tailed P value of &lt;0.05 was considered <lb/></body>

			<body>of emergency surgical or hemostatic intervention, and type of institution (high vs. low volume <lb/>centers). <lb/>OR: odds ratio; CIs: confidence intervals; ISS: Injury Severity Score. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we investigated whether there was a difference in mortality among patients admitted <lb/>due to traumatic injuries during, before, and after dates of national academic acute medicine and <lb/>trauma meetings. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant differences in in-hospital <lb/>mortality among the three groups, even after adjusting for measurable confounders. <lb/>To our knowledge, &quot;national meeting effects&quot; were first investigated in the United States, focusing <lb/>on national cardiology meetings; lower staffing and differences in composition of physicians during <lb/>the meeting dates were found to possibly affect treatment utilization and outcomes [11]. In this <lb/>study, no significant differences in mortality of AMI patients were found between those in the <lb/>hospital during meeting and non-meeting dates; however, high-risk patients with AMI, cardiac <lb/>arrest, and heart failure admitted to teaching hospitals during meeting dates were found to have <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>lower mortality than those admitted during non-meeting dates [11]. The present study is the first to <lb/>examine the &quot;national meeting effect&quot; regarding mortality in trauma patients. <lb/>Previous studies have not detected the &quot;weekend effect&quot;; admission on nights or weekends for <lb/>trauma patients was not associated with increased mortality [13-16, 19, 20] or even better outcomes <lb/>[21]. Generally, a plausible explanation for the &quot;weekend effect&quot; includes several factors such as <lb/>reduced medical staffing, decreased access to some tests and procedures, and the influence of <lb/>variations in case mix [19, 20, 22]. For trauma patients, hospitals are explicitly required to be <lb/>appropriately staffed and to provide optimal care, regardless of when injured patients are admitted <lb/>[21, 23]. However, trauma patients presenting off-hours were more likely to have missed injuries, <lb/>[16, 24], in particular thoracic spine or abdominal injuries [24]. Specifically, Schwartz DA, et al. <lb/>showed that off-hour presentation of pelvic fracture patients with hemorrhagic shock caused a delay <lb/>in door-to-angioembolization time, resulting in increased mortality [23]. <lb/>In theory, variations of patient characteristics would not be influenced by admission dates occurring <lb/>during, before, and after national meetings. While relatively less experienced emergency physicians <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>or trauma surgeons providing leadership would be expected during academic national meeting dates, <lb/>strong leadership, teamwork, and technical skills are essential components for team performance and <lb/>patient care in initial trauma management [25, 26]. Our results showed no significant differences in <lb/>mortality among those admitted during, before, and after national meeting dates; these findings may <lb/>be explained by the possibility that every hospital strives to consistently deliver high quality care. <lb/>Although no clear evidence exists that national academic meetings directly improve medical staff <lb/>performance and positively impact patient outcomes, hospital participation in a trauma quality <lb/>improvement program has been demonstrated to be associated with better patient outcomes [27]. <lb/>Hence, we compared hospital mortality among patients admitted during, before, and after national <lb/>meeting dates to investigate the &quot;post-national meeting effect,&quot; assuming that participation in <lb/>national academic meetings has a positive effect on clinical performance and patient outcomes. <lb/>Despite our hypothesis, our results detected no &quot;post-national meeting effect.&quot; <lb/>Our study has several limitations. First, we could not identify differences in medical staffing among <lb/>the three groups, such as composition of emergency physicians vs. trauma surgeons who treated the <lb/>patients; therefore, we are unable to explain why no significant differences in mortality were found. <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>Second, the influence of national meeting geographical regions and locations was not accounted for, <lb/>which may have affected our results. Third, as Jena AB, et al. showed that high-risk AMI patients <lb/>admitted to teaching hospitals during national meeting dates received less percutaneous coronary <lb/>intervention, hospital type should have been taken into consideration [11]. We performed additional <lb/>analyses according to hospital volume, in which the same results were obtained. Fourth, possible <lb/>confounders, including comorbidities, were unavailable in this study. Fifth, although major tertiary <lb/>hospitals providing high-quality trauma care participate in the JTDB, a degree of random error and <lb/>selection bias may have occurred, as this was not a comprehensive study [17]. Finally, since we <lb/>focused on national academic meetings only in Japan, our results could not be applied to other <lb/>countries, considering differences in the settings and geography of Japanese healthcare systems. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>We observed no significant differences in in-hospital mortality after trauma among patients admitted <lb/>during, before, and after national acute medicine and trauma meeting dates. As hospitals are <lb/>assumed to be struggling to consistently provide optimal care for trauma patients, participating in <lb/></body>
