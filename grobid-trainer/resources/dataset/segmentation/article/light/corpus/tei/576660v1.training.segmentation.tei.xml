			<front>Abstract <lb/>Developmental defects affecting the heart and aortic arch arteries are a key phenotype <lb/>observed in DiGeorge syndrome patients and are caused by a microdeletion on <lb/>chromosome 22q11. Heterozygosity of TBX1, one of the deleted genes, is expressed <lb/>throughout the pharyngeal arches and is considered a key component for the arch artery <lb/>defects. Pax9 is expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm and is downregulated in Tbx1 <lb/>mutant mice. We show here that Pax9 deficient mice are born with complex cardiovascular <lb/>malformations affecting the outflow tract and aortic arch arteries with failure of the 3 rd and 4 th <lb/>pharyngeal arch arteries to form correctly. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Pax9 and <lb/>Tbx1 may function together, and mice double heterozygous for Tbx1/Pax9 presented with a <lb/>significantly increased incidence of interrupted aortic arch when compared to Tbx1 <lb/>heterozygous mice. Using a novel Pax9Cre allele we demonstrated that the site of this Tbx1-<lb/>Pax9 genetic interaction is in the pharyngeal endoderm, therefore revealing that a <lb/>Tbx1/Pax9-controlled signalling mechanism emanating from the pharyngeal endoderm is <lb/>required for critical tissue interactions during normal morphogenesis of the pharyngeal arch <lb/>artery system. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Conotruncal heart malformations, affecting the outflow tract and aortic arch arteries, occur in <lb/>30% of all cases of congenital heart defects (Thom et al., 2006) and are a major cause of <lb/>morbidity and death. Approximately 20% of foetuses identified with conotruncal defects by <lb/>ultrasound are diagnosed with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) (Boudjemline et al., <lb/>2001), the most common microdeletion syndrome with an incidence of 1:4000 live births <lb/>(Scambler, 2000). Patients typically have a 3Mb deletion on chromosome 22 that <lb/>encompasses 45 protein coding genes (Morrow et al., 2018) and ~80% of patients present <lb/>with some form of congenital cardiovascular defect (Momma, 2010), of which one of the <lb/>most common observed is interruption of the aortic arch (Unolt et al., 2018). Although <lb/>clinically rare in the general population, approximately 50% of all cases of interrupted aortic <lb/>arch occur in 22q11DS patients (Boudjemline et al., 2001; Lewin et al., 1997; Van Mierop <lb/>and Kutsche, 1986). Interrupted aortic arch is a consequence of the left 4 th pharyngeal arch <lb/>artery (PAA) failing to form correctly during embryonic development. There are five pairs of <lb/>PAA that arise within a series of repeated protuberances on either side of the developing <lb/>pharynx known as the pharyngeal arches. These arches consist of paraxial mesoderm-and <lb/>neural crest cell (NCC)-derived mesenchyme, and are externally enclosed by ectoderm and <lb/>internally lined by endoderm (Graham, 2003). The initially bilaterally symmetrical PAA <lb/>develop sequentially in a cranial to caudal sequence during embryogenesis but undergo a <lb/>complex remodelling process that is conserved in mammals to form the asymmetrical <lb/>mature aortic arch configuration (Bamforth et al., 2013; Hiruma et al., 2002). Of the genes <lb/>deleted in 22q11DS, hemizygosity of TBX1 is considered to be the cause of the <lb/>cardiovascular defects seen in these patients (Jerome and Papaioannou, 2001; Lindsay et <lb/>al., 2001; Merscher et al., 2001). Tbx1 is expressed throughout the pharyngeal arches within <lb/>the ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm cells and is critical for pharyngeal arch and PAA <lb/>development. Complete loss of Tbx1 from the mouse results in a failure of the pharyngeal <lb/>arches to form correctly resulting in hypoplasia of the second arch and aplasia of the <lb/>remaining caudal arches, leading to an absent thymus and common arterial trunk (Jerome <lb/>and Papaioannou, 2001; Merscher et al., 2001). In contrast, heterozygous deletion of Tbx1 <lb/>only affects development of the 4 th PAA resulting in interruption of the aortic arch in a <lb/>minority of mice with aberrant right-subclavian artery observed more frequently (Lindsay et <lb/>al., 2001). Although almost all 22q11DS patients are hemizygous for the deletion, the <lb/>phenotypic spectrum is highly variable (Unolt et al., 2018), thus it has been proposed that <lb/>genes outside of the deleted region may impact on the clinical phenotype (Guo et al., 2011). <lb/>Several genes have been identified as potential modifiers of 22q11DS as determined by <lb/>genetic interaction studies and transcriptome analyses in Tbx1 mutant mice (Aggarwal and <lb/></body>

			<body>Morrow, 2008; Ivins et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2008; Papangeli and Scambler, 2013). One such <lb/>candidate gene is Pax9 whose expression in the pharyngeal endoderm was found to be <lb/>significantly reduced in Tbx1-deficient embryos (Ivins et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2008), <lb/>although further investigations into the nature of any putative interaction have not been <lb/>reported. Pax9 belongs to a family of Pax genes encoding for transcription factors involved <lb/>in various cellular roles during embryonic development (Chi and Epstein, 2002; Mansouri et <lb/>al., 1996) and is specifically expressed in the endoderm of all four pharyngeal pouches of <lb/>the mouse by E9.5 (Neubuser et al., 1995). At later stages in mouse development, Pax9 is <lb/>expressed in the oesophagus, somites and limbs, and within the neural crest contributing to <lb/>craniofacial development (Peters et al., 1998). Embryos deficient for Pax9 exhibit <lb/>craniofacial defects, including cleft secondary palate as well as absent teeth, skeletal <lb/>defects, and lack derivatives of the 3 rd and 4 th pharyngeal pouches, i.e. the thymus, <lb/>parathyroids and ultimobranchial bodies (Peters et al., 1998) yet the role of Pax9 in <lb/>cardiovascular development has not been determined. <lb/>In this study we have investigated cardiovascular development in Pax9-deficient mice, and <lb/>show that loss of Pax9 leads to complex cardiovascular defects affecting the outflow tract <lb/>and aortic arch arteries. We also uncover a strong genetic interaction between Tbx1 and <lb/>Pax9 that leads to 4 th PAA-derived defects in double heterozygous mice, and this interaction <lb/>is cell-autonomous within the pharyngeal endoderm. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Results <lb/>Pax9-deficient embryos have cardiovascular defects. <lb/>Mice lacking Pax9 die perinatally and exhibit craniofacial, pharyngeal gland and skeletal <lb/>defects (Peters et al., 1998). A cleft secondary palate had initially been suggested as a <lb/>cause for postnatal lethality of Pax9-deficient mice, however, recent observations showed <lb/>that ~1% of Pax9 -/-mice have an intact secondary palate but still die shortly after birth (data <lb/>not shown). We therefore carefully re-analysed Pax9 -/-neonates from a Pax9 +/-intercross to <lb/>identify the cause of death. When dissected, we found that all Pax9 -/-neonates had a <lb/>patterning defect of their aortic arch arteries which included an interrupted aortic arch with <lb/>aberrant right subclavian artery (Fig. 1B; Table 1). To investigate these defects in more <lb/>detail we processed Pax9 -/-embryos for histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <lb/>and found that Pax9 -/-embryos presented with a wide range of cardiovascular abnormalities <lb/>(Fig. 1C-Q; Table 1). These defects included perimembranous ventricular septal defect <lb/>(VSD), double-outlet right ventricle with interventricular communication, interruption of the <lb/>aortic arch and aberrant right subclavian artery. The common carotid arteries were also <lb/>frequently absent resulting in unilateral or bilateral internal and external carotids arising <lb/>directly from the dorsal aorta and the aberrant right subclavian artery. Pax9 -/-embryos also <lb/>had a hypoplastic aorta (Fig. 1M-O) and bicuspid aortic valves (Fig. 1Q). <lb/>Developmental defects of the arch arteries occur when the PAA fail to form or remodel <lb/>correctly. To investigate the morphogenesis of the PAA we performed high-resolution <lb/>episcopic microscopy (HREM) on E10.5 and E11.5 Pax9 -/-embryos and manually <lb/>segmented the datasets to create 3-D images of the PAA. Analysis of E10.5 coronal <lb/>sections revealed that the 3 rd and 4 th pharyngeal arches of Pax9 -/-embryos were smaller <lb/>compared to Pax9 +/+ controls (Fig. 2A-C), as previously reported (Peters et al., 1998). At <lb/>E10.5 the developing PAA are bilaterally symmetrical, having formed in a cranial to caudal <lb/>sequence. The 1 st and 2 nd PAA have normally regressed by this stage, and the 3 rd , 4 th and <lb/>6 th PAA are present (Bamforth et al., 2013; Hiruma et al., 2002) (Fig. 2A). In Pax9 -/-<lb/>embryos the 1 st and 2 nd PAA were abnormally persistent, the 3 rd PAA was either absent, <lb/>hypoplastic or interrupted, and the 4 th PAA was absent (Fig. 2B, C; Table 2). The aortic sac <lb/>was also hypoplastic in Pax9 -/-embryos compared to the controls (Fig. 2B, C). Intra-cardiac <lb/>injection of India ink at E10.5-E11.0 showed that, in controls, the caudal PAA were patent to <lb/>ink and of equivalent size (Fig. 2D). In Pax9 -/-embryos, however, persisting 1 st and 2 nd PAA <lb/>were patent to ink, and the 3 rd PAA were hypoplastic (Fig. 2J -L) or non-patent to ink, and <lb/>therefore presumed absent. The majority of the 4 th PAA were bilaterally non-patent to ink <lb/></body>

			<body>(Fig. 2J -L; Table 2). Immunohistochemical staining for Pecam1 showed that the <lb/>endothelium within the 3 rd and 4 th pharyngeal arches had formed lumenised PAA at E10.5 in <lb/>control embryos (Fig. 2G), but in Pax9 -/-embryos the 3 rd PAA was visibly smaller in size and <lb/>only isolated endothelial cells were seen within the 4 th pharyngeal arch (Fig. 2H, I). <lb/>During E11.5 of mouse development, the PAA system begins to remodel and becomes <lb/>asymmetric in appearance (Bamforth et al., 2013; Hiruma et al., 2002). In Pax9 control <lb/>embryos at this stage the right 6 th PAA appeared thinner and the distal outflow tract was <lb/>septated. The carotid duct, the region of the dorsal aorta between the 3 rd and 4 th PAA, had <lb/>begun to involute but the 3 rd , 4 th and 6 th PAA remained connected to the dorsal aortae (Fig. <lb/>3A). In Pax9 -/-embryos at E11.5, evidence of presumed persisting 1 st or 2 nd PAA were <lb/>observed extending anteriorly from the aortic sac, and the 3 rd PAA were also affected, either <lb/>unilaterally or bilaterally, and were either absent, hypoplastic or interrupted and not <lb/>connected to the dorsal aortae (Fig. 3B-D). The carotid ducts were maintained, and this, <lb/>coupled with the abnormal detachment of the 3 rd PAA from the dorsal aorta and the <lb/>persistence of the 1 st or 2 nd PAA, resulted in an absent common carotid artery and the <lb/>internal and external carotid arteries arising directly from the aortic arch arteries as observed <lb/>at E15.5 (Fig. 1). Additionally, the distal outflow tract was unseptated and the 4 th PAA were <lb/>bilaterally absent (Fig. 3B-D; Table 2). <lb/>Looping of the heart tube at E10.5 was not affected in Pax9 -/-embryos (Fig. 3E, F). <lb/>In normal mouse development the outflow tract cushions rotate through an anticlockwise <lb/>direction (Bajolle et al., 2006) resulting in the major septal and parietal cushions being <lb/>positioned side by side (Fig. 3G-I). In Pax9 -/-embryos, however, by the end of the E11.5 <lb/>stage these cushions were aberrantly positioned, with the parietal cushion more anterior to <lb/>the septal cushion, indicating that a clockwise rotation of the outflow tract cushions had <lb/>occurred (Fig. J-L). This failure in proper rotation of the major cushions is potentially the <lb/>cause of the double-outlet right ventricle phenotype observed at E15.5. <lb/>This data demonstrates that Pax9 -/-embryos display a range of cardiovascular <lb/>developmental defects resulting from the abnormal morphogenesis of the PAA. The 1 st and <lb/>2 nd PAA often persist, the 3 rd PAA forms but is smaller and subsequently collapses, and the <lb/>4 th PAA fails to form at all. These defects directly lead to the absent common carotid artery, <lb/>aberrant right subclavian artery and interrupted aortic arch phenotypes seen in foetal and <lb/>neonatal stages in Pax9 -/-mice. Moreover, delayed outflow tract septation occurs with <lb/>abnormal rotation leading to the double-outlet right ventricle phenotype. <lb/></body>

			<body>Pharyngeal endoderm signalling influences neural crest cell differentiation. <lb/>During normal embryogenesis, a subset of NCC, the cardiac neural crest, migrate into the <lb/>caudal pharyngeal arches to provide support to the developing PAA and also contribute to <lb/>outflow tract septation (Hutson and Kirby, 2003). Pax9 is predominantly expressed in the <lb/>pharyngeal endoderm (Fig. S1), but is also known to be expressed within the NCC <lb/>contributing to craniofacial development (Kist et al., 2007), although expression in cardiac <lb/>NCC has not been described. We therefore looked to see if a cell autonomous loss of Pax9 <lb/>from NCC resulted in cardiovascular defects. Conditional deletion of Pax9 using Wnt1Cre <lb/>transgenic mice (Danielian et al., 1998), and the Pax9 flox allele (Kist et al., 2007), however, <lb/>did not result in cardiovascular abnormalities, although cleft palate was observed as <lb/>expected (Fig. 4A-D). We next looked to see if the migration of NCC was affected in global <lb/>Pax9 -/-embryos using Wnt1Cre and eYFP (Srinivas et al., 2001) reporter mice to create <lb/>embryos where the NCC could be lineage traced. Live fluorescence imaging of <lb/>Pax9 +/+ ;Wnt1Cre;eYFP embryos at E10.5 revealed NCC present in the head and dorsal <lb/>route ganglia, as well as migrating towards and filling the pharyngeal arches (Fig. 4E, G, I). <lb/>A similar pattern was observed in Pax9 -/-;Wnt1Cre;eYFP embryos (Fig. 4F, H, J). <lb/>Immunostaining for BrdU incorporation specifically in NCC showed no significant difference <lb/>in NCC proliferation in the 4 th pharyngeal arch at E10.5 (Fig. 4K-M), and very little apoptosis <lb/>occurred throughout the caudal pharyngeal arches in both control and Pax9 -/-embryos (Fig. <lb/>4N-P). These observations indicated that the migration of NCC per se to the pharyngeal <lb/>arches were not affected in Pax9 -/-embryos. <lb/>It therefore appears that the rapid collapse of the 3 rd PAA at E11.5 in Pax9 -/-embryos, <lb/>resulting in an absent common carotid artery, cannot be explained by aberrant NCC death, <lb/>proliferation or migration pattern at E10.5. Given that NCC differentiate into the smooth <lb/>muscle cells that support the remodelling PAA (Waldo et al., 1996), we looked to see if <lb/>smooth muscle cell recruitment to the 3 rd PAA was affected in Pax9 -/-embryos. Sections <lb/>from E10.5 embryos were immunostained using an anti-alpha smooth muscle actin antibody <lb/>to visualise smooth muscle cells around the 3 rd PAA. As expected, no staining was observed <lb/>in control embryos around the 4 th PAA at this stage (Losa et al., 2017). Evidence of smooth <lb/>muscle cell recruitment to the 3 rd PAA was seen in each control embryo examined (Fig. 4Q, <lb/>R), however no evidence of any smooth muscle cell investment around the 3 rd PAA in Pax9 -<lb/>/-embryo sections was observed (Fig. 4S, T). These results indicated that the 3 rd PAA in <lb/>Pax9 -/-embryos forms but collapses due to a failure of smooth muscle cell investment, <lb/>possibly from a perturbation in signals that emanate from the pharyngeal endoderm under <lb/>Pax9 control. <lb/></body>

			<body>Tbx1 and Pax9 interact in 4 th PAA formation <lb/>The failure of the 4 th PAA to form in Pax9 -/-embryos, however, is likely to be due to an <lb/>alternative mechanism as NCC are not required for initial PAA formation (Waldo et al., <lb/>1996). To further investigate the role of Pax9 in cardiovascular development, we looked at <lb/>the effect of Pax9 loss on the pharyngeal arch transcriptome at E9.5 (Fig. 5A-C). Analysis of <lb/>the RNA-seq data identified a total of 3863 significant differentially expressed genes <lb/>(adjusted p value &lt;0.1; 2073 genes up and 1790 genes down). Interestingly, Tbx1 was <lb/>significantly reduced in Pax9 -/-embryos at E9.5, and this was confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 5H). <lb/>We also confirmed that Pax9 expression was reduced in Tbx1-null embryos (Fig. S2). As <lb/>Tbx1 expression is crucial for 4 th PAA morphogenesis (Lindsay et al., 2001; Zhang et al., <lb/>2005) this data suggested that Pax9 may function together with Tbx1 rather than being <lb/>downstream of it. We therefore compiled a list of all the genes reported to be significantly <lb/>differentially expressed in Tbx1-null embryos from published microarray and mouse genetic <lb/>interaction studies (Ivins et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2008; van Bueren et al., 2010) giving a total <lb/>of 1476 unique Tbx1-related genes. These were then compared to all genes significantly <lb/>changed in Pax9 -/-embryo pharyngeal arch tissue giving 342 genes that were common to <lb/>both datasets (Fig. 5D-F) and suggesting that Tbx1 and Pax9 may share a genetic network. <lb/>Among these common genes were Chd7 and Gbx2 (Fig. 5I, J) which have been shown to <lb/>interact with Tbx1 in mice (Calmont et al., 2009; Randall et al., 2009). <lb/>To investigate a potential genetic interaction in vivo between Tbx1 and Pax9 we confirmed <lb/>that both genes were co-expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm (Fig. S3). We then crossed <lb/>Tbx1 +/-mice (Jerome and Papaioannou, 2001) with Pax9 +/-mice to create Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-<lb/>double heterozygotes. Genotype analysis of 168 pups at weaning revealed that only two <lb/>Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-mice were alive, a highly significant deviation from the 42 expected of each <lb/>genotype from this cross (p=1.4x10 -12 ; Table S1). To identify the timing of lethality, neonates <lb/>were observed from the day of birth with all Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-mutants dying during the first 24 <lb/>h. Examination of neonatal aortic arch arteries revealed that all controls had normal arch <lb/>arteries (Fig. 6A) while Tbx1 +/-neonates frequently presented with aberrant right subclavian <lb/>artery (Fig. 6B; Table 1). All dead Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-neonates had 4 th PAA-derived defects <lb/>including interruption of the aortic arch (Fig. 6C, D; Table 1). <lb/>Having established postnatal cardiovascular defects we next analysed E15.5 Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-<lb/>embryos by MRI (Fig. 6E-H). All wild-type and Pax9 +/-embryos were normal. Of the Tbx1 +/-<lb/>embryos examined, a high proportion had some form of 4 th PAA-derived defect, including <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>interrupted aortic arch and aberrant right-subclavian artery (Fig. 6F; Table 1). All <lb/>Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos examined, however, had some form of 4 th PAA-derived defect (Fig. <lb/>6G, H; Table 1) with the incidence of interrupted aortic arch being significantly increased <lb/>compared to Tbx1 +/-embryos (p&lt;0.001). The incidence of perimembranous VSD was also <lb/>significantly increased (p=0.04), but none of the embryos examined displayed outflow tract <lb/>defects or bicuspid aortic valve. Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos at E10.5 were injected intra-<lb/>cardially with ink (Fig. 6I-L) and the patency of the developing 4 th PAA was then compared <lb/>between Tbx1 +/-and Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos (Table 2). All Tbx1 +/-embryos displayed a 4 th <lb/>PAA defect, predominantly a hypoplastic vessel, consistent with previously published <lb/>observations (Calmont et al., 2009; Lindsay et al., 2001; Randall et al., 2009; Ryckebusch et <lb/>al., 2010). In Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos a significant increase in bilateral aplasia of the 4 th PAA <lb/>(p=0.004) was seen, explaining the increase in 4 th PAA related cardiovascular defects <lb/>observed in the Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos at E15.5 and in neonates (i.e. interrupted aortic <lb/>arch, aberrant right subclavian artery, and cervical origins of the right subclavian artery and <lb/>aorta). No defects of PAA 1, 2 and 3 were seen. This analysis therefore revealed that a <lb/>concomitant heterozygosity of Tbx1 and Pax9 resulted in a significantly increased incidence <lb/>of interrupted aortic arch caused by the failure of the 4 th PAA to form. <lb/>Tbx1 and Pax9 interact cell autonomously in the pharyngeal endoderm for 4 th PAA <lb/>formation <lb/>The presumed site of the Tbx1-Pax9 interaction is the pharyngeal endoderm, and to <lb/>demonstrate a cell-autonomous interaction in this tissue we crossed Tbx1 flox mice (Xu et al., <lb/>2004), with a novel Pax9Cre transgenic mouse (Fig. 7A-C). This Pax9Cre strain has the Cre <lb/>recombinase gene inserted into the Pax9 coding region and effectively results in a Pax9-null <lb/>allele. The Pax9Cre allele functions as expected by activating R26R lacZ expression <lb/>specifically in the pharyngeal endoderm from E9.5 to E11.5 (Fig. 7D-G; Fig. S4) and <lb/>Pax9Cre;Pax9 flox neonates (i.e. Pax9-null) die at birth with the typical Pax9 -/-phenotype <lb/>(Fig. 7H-Q). To test the specificity of the Pax9Cre allele the pharyngeal arches of <lb/>Pax9Cre;eYFP E9.5 embryos (Fig. 8A) were dissociated into single cells and flow-sorted <lb/>into eYFP-positive and -negative populations. The eYFP-positive population was significantly <lb/>enriched for eYFP and Pax9 transcripts (Fig. 8B, C). Tbx1 flox and Pax9Cre mice were <lb/>intercrossed to create Tbx1 +/ flox ;Pax9Cre embryos which are double heterozygous for each <lb/>gene but only in the Pax9 expression domain. A significant reduction in Tbx1 RNA levels <lb/>was observed in eYFP-positive flow-sorted pharyngeal endoderm cells from conditionally <lb/>deleted E9.5 mutant embryos compared to Pax9Cre;eYFP controls (Fig. 8D). Litters from a <lb/>Tbx1 +/flox and Pax9Cre cross were collected on the day of birth, and a significant reduction in <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>the expected number of Tbx1 +/flox ;Pax9Cre mutants was found (p=2.4x10 -5 ; Table S2) and <lb/>62.5% of these mutants displayed an arch artery defect (Fig. 8F). We then collected <lb/>embryos (E13.5-E15.5) and analysed them by MRI or µCT which revealed that 37% of <lb/>mutants presented with an arch artery defect (Fig. 8H). We also collected embryos at E10.5 <lb/>and injected them intracardially with ink to visualise the PAA. All Tbx1 +/flox control embryos <lb/>analysed had normal PAA, with all three vessels being patent to ink and of a similar <lb/>diameter, whilst the majority of Tbx1 +/flox ;Pax9Cre mutant embryos presented with some form <lb/>of 4 th PAA defect (Fig. 8J; Table 2). <lb/>Our data, therefore, demonstrate that Pax9 is critical for cardiovascular development and <lb/>functionally interacts with Tbx1 in the pharyngeal endoderm. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/> Loss of Pax9 results in complex cardiovascular defects <lb/>Pax9 plays a key role in cardiovascular development as Pax9 -/-neonates and embryos <lb/>display a range of cardiovascular defects. Chromosomal deletions that include PAX9 have <lb/>been identified in patients with cardiovascular abnormalities (Hayashi et al., 2015; <lb/>Kamnasaran et al., 2001; Santen et al., 2012; Schuffenhauer et al., 1999; Shapira et al., <lb/>1994) suggesting it has potential importance in human cardiovascular development. Of <lb/>these, one patient with a 105 kb hemizygous deletion of 14q13 presented with interruption of <lb/>the aortic arch, a hypoplastic aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, and a ventricular septal defect <lb/>(Santen et al., 2012), all of which appear with high penetrance in mouse Pax9-null embryos. <lb/>This small deletion only removed PAX9, NKX2-1 and NKX2-8, although deletion of either <lb/>Nkx2 gene in mice does not result in any cardiovascular defects (Kimura et al., 1996; Pabst <lb/>et al., 2003). It is therefore possible that hemizygous deletion of PAX9 in humans can <lb/>recapitulate, in part, the mouse knockout phenotype. <lb/>Tbx1 and Pax9 interact in 4 th PAA development <lb/>Published microarray studies investigating the transcriptome of Tbx1-null embryos have <lb/>implicated Pax9 as a downstream target of Tbx1, although this was not demonstrated with <lb/>any functional assays (Ivins et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2008). Analysis of our Pax9-null <lb/>pharyngeal arch transcriptome data revealed that Tbx1 levels were significantly reduced <lb/>suggesting that perhaps Pax9 and Tbx1 may function together rather than work in a <lb/>hierarchal pathway. Further analysis identified that many genes differentially expressed in <lb/>Tbx1-null embryos, or shown to interact with Tbx1 in mouse models, were also significantly <lb/>differentially expressed in Pax9-null embryos, e.g. Chd7 and Gbx2. Mice heterozygous for <lb/>Chd7 have abnormal 4 th PAA derivatives and a combined heterozygosity with Tbx1 results in <lb/>an increased incidence of 4 th PAA defects (Randall et al., 2009). Gbx2-null embryos display <lb/>cardiovascular defects (Byrd and Meyers, 2005) and Tbx1 and Gbx2 have also been shown <lb/>to genetically interact in PAA development (Calmont et al., 2009). Although both these Tbx1 <lb/>targets have been demonstrated to interact in the pharyngeal ectoderm, they are also <lb/>expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm and could therefore interact with Pax9 either directly <lb/>or indirectly in this tissue. As our data strongly suggested that Pax9 may interact with Tbx1 <lb/>and its related genes in the morphogenesis of the PAA we therefore looked for a genetic <lb/>interaction between Tbx1 and Pax9 in mice. We found that all mice examined (embryos and <lb/>neonates) double heterozygous for each gene (i.e. Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-) displayed some defect <lb/></body>

			<body>associated with abnormal development of the 4 th PAA, most notably interrupted aortic arch. <lb/>Although hypoplasia or absence of the 4 th PAA is a feature in mouse embryos heterozygous <lb/>for Tbx1 (Lindsay et al., 2001), this phenotype was significantly more prevalent in <lb/>Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-mice, and much higher than observed in Tbx1 +/-embryos. It therefore <lb/>appears that combining one Pax9-null allele with one Tbx1-null allele exacerbates the <lb/>Tbx1 +/-phenotype. <lb/>We used our novel Pax9Cre mouse to conditionally delete Tbx1 from the pharyngeal <lb/>endoderm, whilst simultaneously creating double haploinsufficiency for the two genes in this <lb/>tissue. A highly significant reduction in the number of Tbx1 +/flox ;Pax9Cre neonates born was <lb/>observed indicating that heterozygous loss of Tbx1 and Pax9 from the pharyngeal endoderm <lb/>has a major impact on post-natal survival, with almost two-thirds of the recovered neonates <lb/>examined having identifiable cardiovascular defects. A similar proportion of affected mutants <lb/>was found at foetal stages. When embryos were examined at mid-embryogenesis, however, <lb/>we found that almost all displayed 4 th PAA defects. When compared to our Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-<lb/>embryo data it was apparent that there was no significant difference in the incidence of <lb/>bilateral 4 th PAA defects between Tbx1 +/flox ;Pax9Cre and Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos. This <lb/>indicates that the conditional deletion of Tbx1 from the pharyngeal endoderm, in the context <lb/>of Pax9 heterozygosity, has the same effect on 4 th PAA morphogenesis as seen in the global <lb/>Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos at E10.5. Although the ink injection data from Tbx1 +/flox ;Pax9Cre <lb/>embryos matches that seen in Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-embryos, and shows that heterozygous loss <lb/>of Tbx1 from the pharyngeal endoderm severely affects PAA morphogenesis, there is a <lb/>discrepancy in the cardiovascular phenotype observed at foetal and neonatal stages that <lb/>does not reflect that seen at mid-embryogenesis, nor that observed in Tbx1 +/-;Pax9 +/-<lb/>embryos. It is well documented, however, that the Tbx1 +/-4 th PAA phenotype does recover <lb/>during development (see Table S3). It therefore appears that a conditional deletion of Tbx1 <lb/>from the pharyngeal endoderm in the context of Pax9 haploinsufficiency replicates the Tbx1 <lb/>heterozygous arch artery phenotype in terms of a highly penetrant 4 th PAA defect at mid-<lb/>embryogenesis that partially recovers by the foetal stage. Our data, however, does raise the <lb/>question as to whether we are seeing the effect of a pharyngeal endoderm specific loss of <lb/>Tbx1 with Pax9Cre, or a genetic interaction occurring between Tbx1 and Pax9 in the <lb/>pharyngeal endoderm. Conditional deletion experiments have been performed in transgenic <lb/>mice to unpick the role of Tbx1 in specific tissues and have examined the effect of Tbx1 <lb/>heterozygosity in the pharyngeal mesoderm and/or epithelium for 4 th PAA development (see <lb/>Table S4). When compared, our data clearly shows that the 4 th PAA phenotype is much <lb/>more penetrant than that seen in embryos only heterozygous for Tbx1 in the pharyngeal <lb/>epithelia. We therefore conclude that we are showing a strong genetic and cell-autonomous <lb/></body>

			<body>interaction between Tbx1 and Pax9 within the pharyngeal endoderm which impacts on 4 th <lb/>PAA morphogenesis. Moreover, and in support of a phenotype extending beyond what is <lb/>expected from a Tbx1 heterozygous phenotype, our Tbx1 flox ;Pax9Cre mice display a <lb/>vascular ring defect and a high incidence of perinatal lethality, features not previously <lb/>described in Tbx1 +/-mice. <lb/>Pax9 signalling from the pharyngeal endoderm is required for 3 rd PAA maintenance <lb/>The mammalian PAA develop symmetrically in a cranial to caudal sequence, and then <lb/>subsequently remodel to form the typical asymmetric aortic arch artery system seen in the <lb/>adult (Bamforth et al., 2013; Hiruma et al., 2002). In normal PAA development the 1 st artery <lb/>forms first, followed by the 2 nd , but these two vessels rapidly remodel and contribute to <lb/>capillary beds and the maxillary and stapedial arteries. In some Pax9 -/-embryos, these <lb/>vessels aberrantly persisted into E10.5 and E11.5 and may contribute to the anomalous <lb/>arrangement of the aortic arch arteries when the 3 rd PAA collapses. In normal development <lb/>the 3 rd PAA will form part of the common and proximal internal carotid arteries, which <lb/>elongate as the embryo grows. The carotid duct involutes and the dorsal aorta anterior to <lb/>this segment will form the distal internal carotid artery, with the external carotid artery <lb/>derived from the proximal parts of the 1 st and 2 nd PAA (Hiruma et al., 2002). The persistence <lb/>of the 1 st and/or 2 nd PAA in Pax9 -/-embryos, coupled with the failure of the 3 rd PAA to be <lb/>maintained and the carotid duct to involute, results in the external carotid arteries rising <lb/>directly from the aorta, and the internal carotid arteries from the anterior dorsal aortae. This <lb/>phenomenon has been described clinically (Roberts and Gerald, 1978). Although migration, <lb/>apoptosis or proliferation of NCC did not appear to be impaired in Pax9-null embryos, it is <lb/>well recognised that NCC differentiate into the smooth muscle cells that are important for the <lb/>stabilisation of the remodelled PAA (Hutson and Kirby, 2003; Losa et al., 2017) and it is the <lb/>failure of smooth muscle cells to envelop the 3 rd PAA in Pax9-null embryos that results in the <lb/>collapse of this vessel. This has also been described in Hoxa3-null embryos, where smooth <lb/>muscle cells fail to develop around the 3 rd PAA which degenerate at E11.5 (Kameda, 2009) <lb/>and reduced NCC migration in genetic mouse and surgical chick models also leads to <lb/>defects of the 3 rd PAA (Bradshaw et al., 2009; Epstein et al., 2000; Franz, 1989; Nishibatake <lb/>et al., 1987). Signalling between the pharyngeal endoderm and NCC does occur (Graham et <lb/>al., 2005) so it is therefore possible that signals emanating from the pharyngeal endoderm <lb/>under Pax9 control are necessary to influence the differentiation of NCC into smooth muscle <lb/>cells, and without these signals the 3 rd PAA is not supported during the remodelling phase of <lb/>arch artery development and it collapses. The double outlet right ventricle phenotype <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>observed at E15.5 in Pax9-null embryos probably arises from the marked outflow tract <lb/>rotation defect due to a change in the aortic to pulmonary valve axis angle (Bostrom and <lb/>Hutchins, 1988; Lomonico et al., 1986) and, possibly, aberrations in the NCC that migrate to <lb/>the outflow tract may contribute to this phenotype (Bradshaw et al., 2009). <lb/>In summary, Pax9 expression in the pharyngeal endoderm has regional (anterior/posterior) <lb/>roles in regulating the morphogenesis of the PAA (Fig. 9). In the 3 rd pharyngeal arch Pax9 is <lb/>important for controlling NCC differentiation into the smooth muscle cells that support the <lb/>remodelling vessel, whereas in the 4 th pharyngeal arch endoderm, the interaction of Pax9 <lb/>with Tbx1 and its targets is crucial for the formation of the 4 th PAA. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Materials and methods <lb/>Mice <lb/>The mice used in this study have previously been described: Pax9 +/-(Peters et al., 1998), <lb/>Pax9 flox (Kist et al., 2007), Tbx +/-(Jerome and Papaioannou, 2001), Tbx1 flox (Xu et al., 2004), <lb/>Wnt1Cre (Danielian et al., 1998), R26R eYFP (Srinivas et al., 2001), R26R lacZ (Soriano, 1999) <lb/>and FLPe (Dymecki, 1996). All mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6J genetic background. All <lb/>studies involving animals were performed in accordance with UK Home Office Animals <lb/>(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. <lb/>Generation of Pax9Cre mice <lb/>The Pax9Cre targeting construct was designed to replace a 1.06 kb section of the Pax9 <lb/>gene, spanning the second half of exon two, containing the start codon, and the first half of <lb/>the 3 rd exon, containing the paired box and octapeptide motif, with a promoterless Cre <lb/>recombinase gene preceded by a consensus Kozak sequence, in the pPNT4 targeting <lb/>vector (Conrad et al., 2003), using standard molecular biology methods (Fig. 7A). The 1.3kb <lb/>right homology arm, generated as previously described (Kist et al., 2005), was inserted <lb/>between the FRT-flanked PGK-Neomycin cassette and the HSV-Thymidine Kinase cassette <lb/>of pPNT4. The unwanted loxP site of pPNT4 was removed by XbaI partial digestion, <lb/>followed by Klenow treatment and re-ligation. The left homology arm was generated as a 7.4 <lb/>kb SalI to SmaI fragment of the Pax9 genomic region including exon 1 and the first half of <lb/>the second exon, and inserted 5&apos; of the Cre recombinase gene. The targeting vector was <lb/>linearized with SfiI and mouse ES cells were targeted and selected as previously described <lb/>(Kearns et al., 2013). Southern blot analysis was performed according to standard methods <lb/>following XbaI digest of genomic DNA. An external southern probe was used to verify <lb/>integration of the targeting cassette in the 5&apos; region (Fig. 7B) and PCR was used to validate <lb/>integration of the 3&apos; region (not shown). The FRT-flanked PGK-Neomycin cassette was <lb/>removed by crossing the derived Pax9Cre-Neo mice with FLPe mice (Dymecki, 1996) to <lb/>create Pax9Cre mice, which were then backcrossed to strain C57Bl/6J for &gt;6 generations. <lb/>Genotyping by multiplex PCR [primers: F1-ACTCAAGCCTCTTTCAGCCC (common), R1-<lb/>TTGTTCTCACTGAGCCGGCCTGT (Pax9 exon 2), and R2-GTTGCATCGACCGGTAATGC (Cre)] <lb/>were used to simultaneously identify the wild-type and Pax9Cre alleles (Fig. 7C). <lb/>Breeding <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Male and female mice were mated and the detection of a vaginal plug the next morning <lb/>considered to be E0.5. Pregnant females were culled on the required day and embryos <lb/>collected. Embryos at E9.5-E11.5 were staged by somite counting. <lb/>Imaging <lb/>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 9.4T MR system (Varian, US) as <lb/>previously described (Bamforth et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2004) on embryos at E15.5. <lb/>High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy (HREM) and micro-computed tomography (µCT) <lb/>techniques have been described in detail elsewhere (Degenhardt et al., 2010; Geyer et al., <lb/>2009). All MRI, HREM and µCT images were converted into a volume data set and <lb/>segmented using Amira software (ThermoFisher Scientific) to create 2-and 3-dimensional <lb/>(3-D) images. Structures were manually outlined using the label field function of Amira and <lb/>surface rendered to produce the 3-D images. Intra-cardiac ink injections were performed as <lb/>described (Calmont et al., 2009). Aorta measurements were taken from the region just <lb/>proximal to the point at which the ascending aorta becomes the aortic arch. Haematoxylin <lb/>and eosin and X-gal staining, and Pax9 whole-mount in situ hybridisation, were performed <lb/>using standard techniques. Tbx1 and Pax9 mRNA co-expression was examined by RNA in <lb/>situ hybridisation using RNAscope ® Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay (Advanced Cell <lb/>Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Probes used: mm-<lb/>Pax9-C2 (454321-C2 at 1:50 dilution) and mm-Tbx1 (481911 used directly). For proliferation <lb/>assays BrdU (Sigma) dissolved in PBS was administered by intraperitoneal injection at a <lb/>dose of 50mg/kg to pregnant dams one hour before embryo collection. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard techniques (antibody details in Table <lb/>S5) on paraformaldehyde fixed embryo sections, and fluorescently imaged on an Axioimager <lb/>(Zeiss). To assess an apoptotic index within the pharyngeal arches, control and Pax9 -/-<lb/>embryos at E10.5 (n=3 per genotype; 30-35 somites) were examined following <lb/>immunostaining with the caspase-3 antibody. To assess a proliferative index within the NCC <lb/>in the pharyngeal arches, control and Pax9 -/-embryos expressing Wnt1Cre activated eYFP <lb/>at E10.5 were examined following immunostaining with anti-BrdU and anti-GFP antibodies <lb/>(n=5 for each genotype; 31-39 somites). All positively stained and DAPI positive cells within <lb/>the pharyngeal arches were counted from at least three slides for each embryo, and the ratio <lb/>of positively stained cells over the total number of cells calculated. For endothelial cell and <lb/>smooth muscle actin immunostaining n=7 control (31-36 somites) and n=6 Pax9 -/-embryos <lb/>(32-35 somites) were examined. <lb/>Transcriptome analysis <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Wild-type (Pax9 +/+ ) and Pax9-null (Pax9 −/− ) embryos at E9.5 (n=3 of each genotype, stage-<lb/>matched for 26-27 somites) were collected in ice-cold DEPC-PBS, and the pharyngeal <lb/>region, from the junction between the first and second pharyngeal arch to the base of the <lb/>heart, dissected free in RNAlater (Sigma). Genotypes were identified by PCR from the <lb/>embryo tails and/or yolk sac material. Total RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Plus <lb/>Micro kit with genomic DNA Eliminator columns, and total RNA eluted in 30 μl RNase-free <lb/>water. RNA concentration and purity were assessed by NanoDrop spectrophotometry and <lb/>Agilent Bioanalyzer with all samples producing a RIN of 10. Genomic DNA contamination <lb/>was excluded by PCR for intronic regions (sensitivity 5 pg/μl). To confirm that the correct <lb/>genotypes were processed, cDNA was made from 100 ng total RNA and a qPCR for Pax9 <lb/>performed (Fig. 5B). The total RNA samples were shipped on dry-ice to EMBLM-GeneCore <lb/>(Heidelberg, Germany) for RNA-seq first-strand specific library preparation using Illumina <lb/>TruSeq, and 100bp paired end reads were generated from an Illumina HiSeq 2000 <lb/>Sequencer. Quality control by FastQC suggested a small amount of adaptor contamination <lb/>in each sample, so raw reads were trimmed of adaptor sequence with Trimmomatic (Bolger <lb/>et al., 2014). Reads shorter than 36bp after trimming were discarded, and reads whose pair <lb/>had been discarded were also removed. Trimmed reads were further filtered to keep only <lb/>uniquely aligned and non-redundant reads to remove a vast majority of pseudogenes <lb/>caused by multi-mapping. Also, to avoid bias due to imbalanced library sizes among <lb/>conditions, all samples were sub-sampled towards the smallest sample (mt-663_1). The <lb/>resulting reads were aligned to the Mouse Genome (Ensembl release 81, GRCm38) using <lb/>the splice aware read aligner STAR 2 (star-2.5.2a-0, 20/01/2017) (Dobin et al., 2013). <lb/>Finally, aligned reads were assigned to Ensembl genes using featureCounts (Liao et al., <lb/>2014) with default parameters. These count tables were imported into R and analysed using <lb/>the package LIMMA (Ritchie et al., 2015) and voom function from Bioconductor (Gentleman <lb/>et al., 2004). <lb/></div>

In the 4 th arch <lb/>endoderm, Tbx1 and Pax9 function together to control formation of the 4 th PAA, potentially <lb/>through collaboration with Chd7 and Gbx2. B, In Pax9 deficient embryos, signals from the <lb/>3 rd pharyngeal arch endoderm are compromised and NCC differentiation into smooth muscle <lb/>cells is impaired resulting in the collapse of the 3 rd PAA by E11.5. In Tbx1-Pax9 double <lb/>heterozygous embryos, reduced levels of Tbx1 and Pax9 in the 4 th pharyngeal arch <lb/>endoderm are insufficient to allow the 4 th PAA to form. <lb/></body>
