			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> Hypercementosis is characterized by cementum <lb/>formation beyond the physiologic limits of the tooth. This <lb/>excessive amount of cementum might lead to an abnormal <lb/>thickness of the apex that becomes round-shaped and/or with <lb/>the root appearance altered macroscopically 6 . <lb/>The incidence of hypercementosis by race or population <lb/>group has not yet been established. Grzesik, et al. 8 studied <lb/>the frequency of this phenomenon in 137 individuals and <lb/>observed an average of 3.8 teeth with hypercementosis per <lb/>individual aged approximately 47 years, and the premolars <lb/>were the most affected teeth 8 . Other studies reported root <lb/>hypercementosis in 84% out of 104 Barbados slave skeletal <lb/>collection from the 17th to 19th centuries 5 . Root <lb/>hypercementosis was also diagnosed in 10 out of 54 <lb/>specimens gathered from prehistoric coastal populations of <lb/>Texas, USA 4 . <lb/>The origin of hypercementosis is attributed to conditions <lb/>such as functional stress due to occlusion forces 4,5,7,19 , <lb/>continuous dental eruption 2,3,9,12 , incorporation of periodontal <lb/>cementicles during physiologic cementum deposition 6 , <lb/>reactionary deposition in response to periapical <lb/>inflammatory processes 18 , systemic factors such as <lb/>atherosclerosis, acromegaly, deforming arthritis, <lb/>hypertrophic arthritis, thyroid diseases and Paget&apos;s <lb/>disease 1,10,13,17 . Figure 1 shows the alterations in dental root <lb/>morphology due to hypercementosis. <lb/>Radiographically, hypercementosis does not alter the <lb/>biologic width between the root surface, the periodontal <lb/>ligament, and the alveolar bone. Although hypercementosis <lb/>can be identified radiographically, it is not possible to <lb/>estimate the amount of extra cementum present in the <lb/>affected root because dentin and cementum have the same <lb/>radiodensity 7,14 . <lb/>Microscopic studies about hypercementosis have <lb/>reported thick layers of cementum characterized by <lb/>deposition of symmetric, highly basophilic lines parallel to <lb/>dentin surface 6,7 . Occasionally, atypical cementum <lb/>depositions can be identified in focal areas as external <lb/>cementum projections. The presence of blood vessels and <lb/>nervous filaments associated to irregular apical cementum <lb/>deposition could contribute to the formation of multiple <lb/>foramina during cementum deposition, due to <lb/></body>

			<body>hypercementosis, originating the apical deltas 19 . <lb/>The lack of recent studies referring to this subject, added <lb/>to the potential clinical implications stimulate the evaluation <lb/>of morphologic characteristics of the apical root third and <lb/>root canal in teeth with hypercementosis. The purpose of <lb/>this study was to examining by scanning electron microscopy <lb/>(SEM) the external anatomy of the apical third of teeth with <lb/>hypercementosis, assessing the existence of any relationship <lb/>between hypercementosis and the diameter of the main <lb/>foramen and the presence of apical foramina. These <lb/>morphological features might implicate specific aspects on <lb/>endodontic therapeutic techniques. <lb/> MATERIAL AND METHODS <lb/> Twenty-eight teeth with hypercementosis were selected <lb/>from the archives of the Discipline of Oral Pathology at the <lb/>Bauru School of Dentistry, SP, Brazil. Hypercementosis <lb/>distribution was classified in the present study as: club shape, <lb/>focal or circular cementum hyperplasia (CCH). The <lb/>longitudinal extension of club shape hypercementosis in the <lb/>root thirds was graded as mild, moderate and severe. <lb/>Regarding the tooth type, the sample comprised: 8 maxillary <lb/>molars, 6 mandibular molars, 6 maxillary premolars, 1 <lb/>mandibular premolar, 4 canines and 3 residual roots. Sample <lb/>distribution according to hypercementosis type, tooth type <lb/>and number of evaluated roots is displayed in Table 1. <lb/>The teeth had the crown and part of the roots sectioned <lb/>transversally with carborundum disk and discarded, leaving <lb/>5-mm-long apical root segments. This procedure was <lb/>necessary in order to fit the specimen in a metallic base <lb/>used for SEM analysis. A total of 41 specimens were <lb/>obtained from 46 roots. <lb/>The specimens were dehydrated by immersion in an <lb/>ascending ethanol series (70, 80, 90 and 100%), sputter-<lb/>coated with gold and examined with a scanning electron <lb/>microscope (Zeiss DSM-940A, Oberkochen, Germany) <lb/>operating at 15kV. The following aspects were examined in <lb/>the SEM analysis: the contour and regularity of the root <lb/>surface; presence of resorption; presence and the number <lb/>of root foramina, and the diameter of the main foramen. <lb/> Tooth group <lb/>Hypercementosis type <lb/> Club shape <lb/>Focal <lb/>CCH <lb/>Teeth <lb/>Roots <lb/>Teeth <lb/>Roots <lb/>Teeth <lb/>Roots <lb/>discrete <lb/>moderate <lb/>severe <lb/>Maxillary molars <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>15 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>Mandibular molars <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>Maxillary premolars <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Mandibular premolars <lb/>-<lb/>1 <lb/>-<lb/>1 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Maxillary canines <lb/>-<lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Residual roots <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>Total <lb/>5 <lb/>5 <lb/>5 <lb/>29* <lb/>7 <lb/>7* <lb/>6 <lb/>10* <lb/> TABLE 1- Distribution of the 28 teeth according to the tooth group, type of hypercementosis and number of examined roots <lb/>* A total of 41 specimens were obtained from a total of 46 roots. <lb/> FIGURE 1- Macroscopic aspects of teeth with different types <lb/>of hypercementosis.

			RESULTS <lb/> Club Shape Hypercementosis <lb/> Out of 12 specimen with mild club shape <lb/>hypercementosis 7 (58.3%) exhibited the apical foramen, 6 <lb/>(50%) foramina and 3 (25%) had the obliteration of the main <lb/>foramen. Four 4 specimens (33.3%) presented more than <lb/>one of the studied aspects. Regarding the main foramen <lb/>diameter, a 150-300 µm range was found. The apical surface <lb/>of the teeth with this type of hypercementosis showed <lb/>sometimes a regular or an irregular aspect. <lb/>It was not possible to observe the apical foramen in only <lb/>1 specimen of teeth with moderate club shape <lb/>hypercementosis. The foramen diameter varied between 150 <lb/>and 450 µm. A larger number of roots presented irregular <lb/>surfaces due to apical resorption as well as the union of the <lb/>roots by the cementum and the presence of an apical main <lb/>foramen and foramina (Figure 2). <lb/>Seven specimens presented severe club shape <lb/>hypercementosis. Only 3 cases (42.8%) showed apical main <lb/>foramen and apical foramina. The main foramen diameter <lb/>varied between 100 and 300 µm. Figure 3 shows the presence <lb/>of tiny foramina at the apex of the mesiobuccal root of a <lb/>maxillary molar. A mineralized structure partially <lb/>obliterating the apical foramina was observed in 1 specimen. <lb/> CCH Hypercementosis <lb/> The CCH type hypercementosis presented depressions <lb/>close to the apical foramen and thick cementum grossly <lb/>deposited on the lateral surface of the root. Figure 4 presents <lb/>buccal roots of a maxillary molar with depressions close to <lb/>the apical foramen and a thick cementum layer on the lateral <lb/>root surface. The average diameter of the main apical <lb/>foramen was 325 µm, and only 3 specimens (42.85%) <lb/>presented foramina. A mandibular molar and a residual root <lb/>also presented irregularities due to the presence of areas of <lb/>resorption. <lb/> Focal hypercementosis <lb/> Regular foramina were observed in the teeth with focal <lb/>hypercementosis. The maxillary canines showed foramina <lb/>in areas of irregular cementum deposition (Figure 5). Data <lb/>referring to the main apical foramen and foramina are <lb/>displayed presented in Table 2. <lb/> FIGURE 2- Moderate club shape hypercementosis.

The impact of <lb/>hypercementosis on endodontic prognosis and its direct <lb/>influence on therapeutic procedures still unclear 20 . Whether <lb/>to keep instrumentation and root canal filling above or <lb/>beyond the cementum-dentin-canal junction in teeth with <lb/>hypercementosis is a difficult clinical choice. The apical <lb/>limits for root canal preparation depend on different <lb/>reference landmarks 16 , and hypercementosis might impair <lb/>such decisions. <lb/>In the present study, SEM analysis of the root apex of <lb/>permanent teeth with hypercementosis provided a rapid <lb/>evaluation of the structure with identification of the main <lb/>foramen and apical foramina, and determination of their <lb/>dimensions. Moreover how and where the apical foramen <lb/>and accessory foramina are displaced due to <lb/>hypercementosis, and possible variations related to its <lb/>morphotypes were observed. Therefore, knowing the apical <lb/>surface of teeth with hypercementosis is important for <lb/>endodontic treatment planning. <lb/>

			The diameter of the main apical foramen ranged in our <lb/>study from 100 to 500 µm. Openings with diameters inferior <lb/>to 100 µm were considered as apical foramina 15 . The <lb/>presence of apical foramina in areas with hypercementosis <lb/>would indicate that cementum deposition occurred <lb/>respecting the neurovascular supply 18 . In the present study, <lb/>the observation of apical foramina in 24 specimens supports <lb/>this idea. The absence of cementum deposition obliterating <lb/>those foramina may be related by cytokines and growth <lb/>factors released by endothelial cells and nervous branches 8 . <lb/>Partial or total obliteration of the apical foramina found in <lb/>the present study could be a reactive response to the cause <lb/>of the tooth extraction 8 . <lb/>Most root apexes of teeth with mild club shape <lb/>hypercementosis did not present surface irregularities and <lb/>cementum resorption, though presenting a large number of <lb/>apical foramina. Moderate club shape hypercementosis <lb/>showed irregular areas and apical foramina. The severe club <lb/>shape hypercementosis presented a decrease in the number <lb/>and sometimes obliteration of the apical foramen. <lb/>The present study found that the circular cementum <lb/>hyperplasia type of hypercementosis was not associated with <lb/>apical resorption. Unless proven otherwise, reactive <lb/>mechanisms due to chronic periapical lesions can be <lb/>involved in the process. This type of hypercementosis might <lb/>represent additional anatomic niches to bacterial <lb/>colonization during root canal infection, which contributes <lb/>to the presence of refractory lesions 21 . <lb/>The focal type of hypercementosis presents foramina <lb/>on its surface, even when sidelong located on the roots. This <lb/>observation warns for the development of endo-perio lesions <lb/>if these openings are be reached by bacteria and its toxic <lb/>products 11,21 . <lb/> CONCLUSIONS <lb/> The detection of a large number of foramina in the apical <lb/>third of teeth with hypercementosis or even the possible <lb/>existence of apical foramen obliteration contributes to <lb/>understand the difficulties faced during endodontic treatment <lb/>of these cases. Constant research seeking the development <lb/>of techniques and materials that provide a correct <lb/>instrumentation and filling of these teeth should be <lb/>encouraged. <lb/>
