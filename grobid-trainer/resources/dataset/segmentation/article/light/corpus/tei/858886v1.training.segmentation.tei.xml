			<body>Introduction <lb/>Appliance of contraceptives is the cornerstone of prevention for unintended <lb/>pregnancy. The rate of unintended pregnancy in the United States is 51% and 45% in <lb/>2011 and in 2008, respectively [1]. In China, more than 20% of teenager and <lb/>unmarried women are pregnant every year [2], and the rate of undergoing repeat <lb/>abortions and non-use of contraception in these adolescents is 39% and 68%, <lb/>respectively [3]. Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods could help <lb/>reduce the high rate of unintended pregnancy. Among all available contraceptive <lb/>methods, the failure rate of IUD is less than 1%, which is almost ideal and the most <lb/>popular contraceptive method in the world [4,5]. IUDs are the most common forms <lb/>for millions of women, particularly in mediate postpartum women [6-8]. Current data <lb/>shows that more than 10% of childbearing aged women are using IUDs worldwide [4]. <lb/>In China, IUDs are utilized by 48%-51% women of childbearing aged in 2010-2015 <lb/>[5,8]. The rate of IUD use in American Muslim women are 21.2% [9]. In breast <lb/>cancer women, the rate of IUDs use is 72.1% [10]. <lb/>Although female contraceptive methods such as sterilization, IUDs and hormonal <lb/>contraception are very effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, some women <lb/>can&apos;t use them due to health condition or side effects. IUDs may cause side effects to <lb/>some women. Migration, especially uterine perforations, expulsion, increased <lb/>menstrual blood loss, pain, and uterus or pelvic inflammatory and risk of extrauterine <lb/>pregnancy after IUD insertion are frequently occurred on patients [11,12]. IUD <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>migrated into bladder is a rare and serious complication [13]. On the other hand, the <lb/>burst release of the cupric ion (Cu 2+ ) of cooper containing IUDs (Cu-IUDs) is an <lb/>important side effect particularly in the first month. The Cu-IUDs, <lb/>levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-RIS) and implants are LARC. <lb/>Excessive Cu 2+ may cause toxic effect on the cell and increase bleeding and pain <lb/>[14-16]. The LNG-RIS can increase irregular bleeding and/or spotting days <lb/>particularly after 3 months of use [17,18]. In addition, the shape, size and weight of <lb/>IUDs also have a great impact on contraceptive effects and side effects. The increase <lb/>in menstrual volume caused by IUD seems to be related to the size of the device. The <lb/>greater the size and weight of the IUD, the greater the amount of menstrual blood loss <lb/>is. 11,12 Relationships between the size of the IUD and the size of the uterine cavity are <lb/>also considered to be a factor in the expulsion of the IUD [12]. <lb/>Inducing local inflammatory reaction in the endometrium is the major effect of all <lb/>IUDs. The inflammatory response can be enhanced by Cu-IUDs. Cu+ is released from <lb/>Cu-IUDs and reached in a concentration in the luminal fluids of the genital tract that <lb/>is toxic for spermatozoa and embryos [19]. Cu-IUDs are usually associated with <lb/>menorrhagia. As a local foreign body reaction, Cu-IUDs can cause certain <lb/>morphological changes in the endometrium and infiltration of monocytes as well as a <lb/>few plasma cells during the proliferative phase of the cycle [20]. The ovulation <lb/>dysfunction hemorrhage may be related to morphological and biochemical changes in <lb/>the IUD use. The LNG-RIS has profound morphological effects upon the <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>endometrium, which may lead to a large number of decidualization of endometrial <lb/>stromal cells, atrophy of the glandular and surface epithelium and vascular <lb/>morphology change [21,22]. Irregular bleeding is still a common reason for the <lb/>discontinuation of progestin-only contraception [21]. Down-regulation of sex steroid <lb/>receptors is found in all cellular components with endometrial exposure to LNG-RIS <lb/>[22]. Paired box 2 (PAX2) is a member of paired box family and is an oncogene <lb/>involved in the development of endometrial cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated <lb/>that occurrence of PAX2 loss expression in endometrial hyperplasia increases with <lb/>malignant progression, and PAX2 gene is required for embryonic uterine <lb/>development, during endometrial carcinogenesis [23-25]. No study has been found <lb/>in the effect of IUDs as the contraceptive method on endometrial sex steroid receptors <lb/>and PAX2 expression in uterus of rhesus macaques. <lb/>We have reported that the main contraceptive mechanism effect of the <lb/>three-dimensional reticular IUD (3-DRIUD) in rats, and observed that the larger the <lb/>physical space occupied by the intrauterine device, the less the pregnancy [26]. In <lb/>present study, we designed and manufactured a novel three-dimensional grid <lb/>intrauterine device (3-DGIUD) with nickel-titanium (nitinol) wire and silicone rubber <lb/>for rhesus macaques, and investigated the changes in the uterus and endometrium of <lb/>macaques after the 3-DGIUD placement. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and Methods <lb/>Materials of the new 3-DGIUD and inserter for rhesus macaques <lb/>The frame of the 3-DGIUD was composed of nitinol wire (with a diameter of 0.05 <lb/>mm) and covered with a layer of silicone rubber. Design the structure of the <lb/>3-DGIUD was according to the size and shape of the rhesus macaque&apos;s uterus. The <lb/>shape of the 3-DGIUD for rhesus macaques was three-dimensional in nature and had <lb/>a reticular grid shape. Its height (H), upper width (D), lower width (d) and thickness <lb/>were 0.6-1.2 cm, 0.4-0.6 cm and 0.2-0.4 cm, respectively (Figure 1 A, B and D). The <lb/>weight of the 3-DGIUD was 0.015-0.020 g. A layer of silicon-boron coupling agent <lb/>was covered on the surface of the 3-DGIUD, and finally multi-layer coating method <lb/>was used with silica gel, and the 3-DGIUD coated with silica gel was vulcanized. The <lb/>3-DGIUD was placed in the external casing tube of the inserter (Figure 1 C). Figure 1 <lb/>shows photographs of the 3-DGIUD for rhesus macaques. <lb/>The material of the inserter of the 3-DGIUD for rhesus macaques was stainless <lb/>steel. Inserters of the 3-DGIUD were composed of an external casing tube (diameter <lb/>2.0 mm) and an internal needle core (push-rod) (diameter 1.8 mm) (Figure 1 C). <lb/>Animals <lb/></body>

			<body>Rhesus macaques were from the Fujian Provincial Non-human Primate Animal <lb/>Experimental Center. All procedures were performed in accordance with &quot;Guidelines <lb/>for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals in Fujian Province&quot;, and approved by <lb/>the Animal Care and Use Committee of Fujian Provincial Institute for Family <lb/>Planning Science and Technology. In December 2016, twenty adult female rhesus <lb/>macaques were divided into 3 groups, 9 macaques were in the 3-DGIUD group, 9 cases <lb/>were taken as the sham operation group, and the other 2 cases were taken as control <lb/>group (without surgery). The license number of the Animal Care and Use was SYXK <lb/>(Min) 2015-0007 and SCXK (Min) 2015-0002. All macaques were single cage <lb/>(stainless steel) with standard feeding. The indoor temperature of the animal was <lb/>22~25°C, the relative humidity was 60~70%, artificial lighting was 12h/d, and the air <lb/>was ventilated. <lb/>Surgical procedures <lb/>The surgical procedures were carried out under sterile technique. Macaques were <lb/>sedated with ketamine, atropine sulfate (0.02 mL/kg intramuscular injection) and <lb/>ketamine hydrochloride (0.1-0.2 mL/kg intramuscular injection in a 50 mg/mL <lb/>aqueous solution), the abdominal regions were shaved and the animals were <lb/>positioned in the supine position. The lower abdominal region was disinfected with <lb/>70% ethanol and iodine tincture and covered with sterilized drapes, and then surgical <lb/></body>

			<body>midline lower abdominal incision was performed and the uterus was exposed (Figure <lb/>2 A and B). The external dimensions of the uterus were measured with a sterilized <lb/>caliper (Figure 2 B). Then a catheter was inserted into the uterus (Figure 2 C). The <lb/>3-DGIUD was placed into the uterine cavity with a catheter for 9 macaques <lb/>(3-DGIUD group). The sham surgery was performed for another 9 macaques (only <lb/>the catheter inserted into the uterine cavity, without the 3-DGIUD placement). Then <lb/>the incision of the uterus was sutured with absorbable sutures (Figure 2 D), and <lb/>macaques received prophylactic antibiotics (Cefazolin, 30 mg/kg). <lb/>Treatment phase and ultrasonography <lb/>On the 10 th -day after operation, 18 female macaques in the 3-DGIUD group (n=9) and <lb/>the sham operation group (n=9) were coupled with fertile male macaques (1:1) to <lb/>observe the effect of contraception of the 3-DGIUD. Two macaques in the 3-DGIUD <lb/>group and one macaque in control group (No. 1, without surgery) were <lb/>hysterectomized at third-month. On 12 months after the 3-DGIUD placement, 6 <lb/>macaques in the 3-DGIUD group and 1 macaque in control group (No. 2, without <lb/>surgery) undergo hysterectomy. <lb/>Abdominal ultrasound was performed for 18 macaques in the 3-DGIUD group and <lb/>the sham operation group every month, to check the uterus, 3-DGIUD and pregnancy. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>For ultrasonography, we used an X300PE (Siemens, Germany) machine with a <lb/>3.5-MHz (VS 13-5, Siemens) probe. <lb/>After hysterectomy, the uterus was used for histology and immunohistochemistry <lb/>and morphological studies. Several cross-sections (about 2 mm thick) were cut <lb/>freehand from the lumen to the myometrial border with a razor blade under <lb/>stereomicrocope magnification. These slices were processed further to assess <lb/>histological development, steroid receptor immunocytochemistry and markers (PAX2) <lb/>of proliferation. Steroid receptors (estrogen and progestin receptor, ER and PR), and <lb/>PAX2 described as below. <lb/>Histology and immunohistochemistry <lb/>Pathological examination was carried out to the endometrium. Samples for histology <lb/>were fixed with a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde, embedded <lb/>in glycol methacrylate (GMA), sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin <lb/>(HE). The expression of ER, PR and PAX2 were detected by immunohistochemistry <lb/>of endometrium on 12 months after surgery. For immunohistochemistry, briefly, <lb/>paraffin-embedded tissue sections were de-paraffinized with xylene and dehydrated <lb/>through graded ethanol, and then their endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched <lb/>with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Antigen retrieval used 10 mM sodium citrate <lb/>buffer for 2 min. Sections were washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and <lb/></body>

			<body>blocked with goat serum for 15 min. Sections were incubated with blocking serum for <lb/>20 min and then with the primary monoclonal anti-ER (1D-5; detects ER alpha, <lb/>Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) and anti-PR (JZB-39; courtesy of Geoffrey Greene, <lb/>University of Chicago, detects PR-A and PR-B), and both were incubated overnight at <lb/>4 °C, washed, and then were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with <lb/>respective biotinylated goat anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibody and biotinylated <lb/>horseradish peroxidase complex both in the Ultra Sensitive™ SP (Mouse/Rabbit) IHC <lb/>Kit (Maixin Bio). For PAX2, Sections were dried for 1 h at 65 °C before treatment <lb/>procedure of deparaffinization, rehydration and epitope retrieval in the Pre-Treatment <lb/>Module, PT-LINK (DAKO) at 95 °C for 20 min in 50 × Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 9.0. <lb/>Before staining the sections, endogenous peroxidase was blocked. The antibodies <lb/>used were against 6H2.1. After incubation, the reaction was visualized with the stain <lb/>used: PAX2, clone: Z-RX2. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. <lb/>Appropriate negative controls including no primary antibody were also tested. The <lb/>sections were incubated with DAB (3,3&apos;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) for <lb/>5 min (Maixin Bio), washed under tap water and counterstained with hematoxylin to <lb/>facilitate identification of cellular elements. The section was cover-slipped. Finally, <lb/>the slides were observed by microscopy (Olympus). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/></body>

Parametric data were <lb/>analyzed statistically using Student&apos;s t-tests. The exact Pearson Chi-Square test <lb/>(Fisher&apos;s Exact Test)was used for the pregnant rate. The difference was considered <lb/>statistically significant for P values &lt;0.05. <lb/>Results <lb/>Uterine corpus measurement results before operation and during surgery <lb/>The weight, uterine corpus measurement (during surgery) and ultrasonography <lb/>(before operation) were shown in Table 1. The mean weight and mean age of the <lb/>3-DGIUD group (n=9) and the sham operation group (n=9) were 6.4 ± 1.0 kg and <lb/>129.6 ± 1.6 months, and 6.5 ± 0.8 kg and 130.8 ± 8.4 months, respectively, no <lb/>significant differences were found between both groups. The weight and age of <lb/>another 2 female control macaques (without operation) were 5.9 kg and 127 months <lb/>and 6.9 kg and 132 months, respectively. In longitudinal section, the uterus was <lb/>shaped like an inverted pear (Figure 3 A and B), whereas in transverse section, it was <lb/>triangular, with a well-defined border by ultrasound. The 3-DGIUD in the uterus <lb/>shown strong echo, and longitudinal and transverse section were 8 × 6 × 3 mm (large) <lb/>(Figure 3 C and D) and 6 × 4 × 2 mm (small) (Figure 3 E). The mean size of uterine <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>corpus of height, width and thickness during operation measured by caliper was 28.1 <lb/>± 1.0 mm, 21.7 ± 2.5 mm and 17.3 ± 2.6 mm in the 3-DGIUD group, and 28.7 ± 0.8 <lb/>mm, 22.8 ± 2.8 mm and 17.3 ± 1.6 mm in control group (t=0.533, 1.153 and 0.000, <lb/>and P=0.609, 0.282 and 1.000); the size of uterine corpus by ultrasound in <lb/>longitudinal section and in transverse section was 28.12 ± 2.26 mm, 19.49 ± 2.11 mm <lb/>and 21.77 ± 2.43 mm in the 3-DGIUD group, and 29.63 ± 2.25 mm, 19.24 ± 1.67 mm <lb/>and 21.33 ± 2.27 mm in control group (t=1.240, 0.297 and 0.589, and P=0.250, 0.787 <lb/>and 0.572), respectively. <lb/>Pregnancy and uterine measurement of rhesus macaques on 3 months and 12 <lb/>months after surgery <lb/>The large type of the 3-DGIUD was placed in 7 rhesus macaques and the small type <lb/>was placed in 2 cases. After 3 months, the 3-DGIUD loss and pregnancy were found <lb/>in one macaque (1/9, 11.1%), and this 3-DGIUD was small type. In the sham <lb/>operation group, 6 and 3 macaques on 3 and 12 months after surgery were pregnant <lb/>(Figure 3 F), respectively, and there was significant difference comparing with the <lb/>3-DGIUD group (x 2 = 5.844, P = 0.05 and x 2 = 14.400, P = 0.000). Uterine <lb/>measurement on 3 months and 12 months after surgery is shown in Table 2. <lb/>Changes in the histology <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>No pelvic infection occurred in 18 rhesus macaques on 3 and 12 months after surgery. <lb/>After hysterectomy, the uterus was cut open. It can be seen that the 3-DGIUD did not <lb/>adhere to surrounding tissues or embed into myometrium (Figure 4 A). The <lb/>endometria in the without operation macaque (No. 1, control) were typically straight <lb/>tubular glands in a normal stroma (Figure 4 B). Pathological examination of uterus on <lb/>3 months after the 3-DGIUD placement: Endometrial epithelium was intact (Figure 4 <lb/>C and D), interstitial cells were edema, short fusiform and dense. A small number of <lb/>glands were curved and vacuole. The spiral artery was hyperplasia on 3 months after <lb/>3-DGIUD placement (Figure 4 C). After the 3-DGIUD placement for 12 months, <lb/>endometrial monolayer columnar epithelium was mostly intact, focal epithelial cells <lb/>were loss with focal hemorrhage, and a few neutrophils infiltration were observed. <lb/>Some glands secreted vacuoles. The vitreous degeneration was found in the basal <lb/>layer and the superficial muscle layer; and the interstitial spiral arterioles developed <lb/>well (Figure 4 D). <lb/>Changes in the immunohistochemistry <lb/>There was no difference in cell distribution and staining intensity of the expression of <lb/>ER, PR and PAX2 between non-surgical rhesus macaque (No.2, control group) and <lb/>the 3-DGIUD placement group. The Figure 5 illustrates representative examples of <lb/>the ER, PR and PAX2 immunostaining of uterine sections of normal endometrium <lb/></body>

			<body>(No. 2, control) (Figure 5 A, C and E) and the 3-DGIUD group (Figure 5 B, D and F). <lb/>The positive ER, PR and PAX2 were shown in the nuclear and cytoplasmic <lb/>immunostaining of endometrial glands. ER, PR and PAX2 expression status in <lb/>endometrium was normal (Figure 5 B, D and F). No loss, increase and decrease of <lb/>ER, PR and PAX2 protein expression were found. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Principal findings of the study <lb/>We designed the shape of the 3-DGIUD by using nitinol wire, performed rhesus <lb/>macaque experiments, and investigated the changes in the uterus of rhesus macaques <lb/>in this study. The uterine shape and size of the rhesus macaque were similar to human <lb/>(only smaller than human). Macaques (non-human primate animal) may be the best <lb/>animal model for experiment of IUDs. We explored that the weight and uterine size of <lb/>macaques increased on 3 months and 12 months after the 3-DGIUD placement. <lb/>Changes in endometrial epithelium by the local oppression of the 3-DGIUD were <lb/>observed. No alterations were found in the expression of endometrial ER, PR and <lb/>PAX2 after the 3-DGIUD placement. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results of the study in the context of other observations <lb/>Materials of the frame of IUDs: The frame of currently used IUD is made of <lb/>stainless steel and plastic, and included copper or additional hormones [27,28]. The <lb/>Cu (CuT380A) IUD is the only non-hormonal LARC device approved by the United <lb/>States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [29]. The Cu 2+ of Cu-IUD-releasing <lb/>such as small T-shaped devices which made of flexible plastic, can kill sperm. The <lb/>Cu-IUD is a LARC (up to twelve years), however some women discontinue use due <lb/>to undesired side effects such as pain or cramping and complaints of heavy bleeding <lb/>[14-16,28]. The high rate of amenorrhea is often seen with the higher progestin <lb/>devices [30,31]. In present study, the frame of the new 3-DGIUD is made of nitinol <lb/>wire and silicone rubber. The nitinol wire is no toxic and used widely in clinical such <lb/>as orthopedics, bone and cardiovascular stents. The nitinol frame was covered with <lb/>silicone rubber, to prevent the 3-DGIUD from adhering to the endometrium. The <lb/>metal copper and progestin are not used for the 3-DGIUD. These may avoid side <lb/>effect of copper and hormone IUDs. <lb/>Efficacy and side effects of IUDs: Proper installation of IUD or IUD system will <lb/>reduce adverse effects and improve acceptability, resulting in enhanced continuation <lb/>of the IUD use [32]. Cramping pain, erratic bleeding or menorrhagia and expulsion of <lb/>IUDs may be caused by the dimensional incompatibility. In the present study, the <lb/>small type of 3-DGIUD was expulsion in one macaque at 3 months. The remaining 8 <lb/>macaques, no pregnancy occurred after surgery. Therefore, the size of IUD is too <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>small, easy to fall off, leading to pregnancy. On the other hand, menorrhagia, <lb/>dislocation or expulsion and contraceptive efficacy may be affected by the shape and <lb/>the weight of IUDs. If the shape is too large or the weight is too heavy of the IUD, <lb/>severe compression will be caused. The rigidity of the inserted tube may also be <lb/>linked to risks [33,34]. In the present study, we improved the shape of IUDs. The <lb/>three-dimensional structure for macaques replaced the two-dimensional structure of <lb/>the commonly used IUDs. The weight of the 3-DGIUD&apos;s frame was light. The space <lb/>of uterine cavity was occupied by the 3-DGIUD and embryo implantation was <lb/>interfered. Nitinol has a memory function, and can restore to the designed shape at <lb/>body temperature. It has a good flexibility, may be conformed to the contraction and <lb/>activity of the uterus, and avoided uterine perforation. <lb/>The contraceptive efficacy is very important for IUDs. Wu et al. reported [35] that <lb/>the LNG-IUS placed in 3 monkeys, expulsion of device is found in one monkey. In <lb/>human women, the expulsion rate of postpartum IUD varies according to the <lb/>placement time, delivery method, and the type of IUDs, ranging from 1.9% to 29.7% <lb/>[36-39], while removal rates are 3.6% to 19.3% due to associate side effects <lb/>(bleeding, pain and discharge) [36,38]. <lb/>Clinical implications of the study <lb/>Effects of IUDs on the uterus: Wang et al. [40] reported that the chronic endometrial <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>inflammation of histologic features occurs after placement a bare copper wire to <lb/>contraception in the uterus of rhesus macaques. The chronic and non-specific <lb/>endometrial inflammation may be one of contraceptive effects of the Cu-IUD. The <lb/>strong local inflammatory response is induced by LNG-IUS for the transplant <lb/>recipients as in the healthy control [41]. <lb/>The detection of ER, PR and PAX2 expression can be used to predict the <lb/>response of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer for IUD use: Two studies <lb/>reported that IUD has nothing to do with the increased risk of breast cancer [42,43], <lb/>whereas other studies reported that IUDs are associated with an increased risk of <lb/>breast cancer [44,45]. In the LNG-IUS used patients, the recurrence and formation of <lb/>endometrial polyp may be inhibited through lowering the expression of ER and PR <lb/>[46]. The LNG-IUS can reduce the expression of ER and PR in endometrium and <lb/>inhibit endometrial proliferation [47]. When the conservative treatment with LNG <lb/>-IUS failed, the expression of PR and ER of these patients were higher [48]. The <lb/>complete down-regulation of PR and ER expression in uterine glands and stroma is <lb/>caused by the LNG-IUS in human endometrial hyperplasia [49]. The LNG released <lb/>locally from the IUD has a depressive effect on the ER and PR, which may contribute <lb/>to the contraceptive effect of this type of IUD and may also be the causes of <lb/>LNG-IUS-induced irregular bleeding and amenorrhoea [50]. In this study, PAX2 <lb/>expression was normal, and there was no decrease, loss or over-expression after <lb/>placement 3-DGIUD. PAX2 is a downstream gene in the steroid hormone receptor <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>signal pathway. It is over-expressed in endometrial cancer and benign endometrial <lb/>hyperplasia [51]. Recently, Monte et al. [23] and Quick et al. [25] reported that PAX2 <lb/>deficiency in up to 77% of endometrial adenocarcinoma and 71% of patients with <lb/>atypical endometrial hyperplasia. As an oncogene involves in the development of <lb/>endometrial cancer, the expression of PAX2 is increased in the neoplastic lesion <lb/>progresses from a premalignant state to endometrial cancer. Knock-down of PAX2 <lb/>may lead to the decrease of cell viability, invasion and migration, while PAX2 <lb/>over-expression causes to the opposite effects. PAX2 acts as a tumor suppressor in <lb/>proliferative and self-renewing endometrial epithelial cells [23]. <lb/>Research implications <lb/>Unanswered questions: Birth control plays pivotal roles in the reduction of maternal, <lb/>infant, and child mortality. As the main method of contraception, IUD is the focus of <lb/>clinical research. Questions relating to the risks of IUD use remain unanswered. The <lb/>material, size and shape of the IUD have significant impacts on contraceptive <lb/>efficacy, and side effects may be avoided or decreased by changes in the shape and <lb/>materials of IUDs. The size of IUDs is too small to be expelled [33,34]. In the present <lb/>study, a small type of 3-DGIUD was expelled from the uterus after 3 months. <lb/>Proposals for future research: Contraceptive effectiveness and side effects of <lb/>IUDs should be studied by improvement of the material and the shape of IUDs.

The 3-DGIUD was non-toxic and had good contraceptive <lb/>effectiveness for macaques. <lb/></body>
