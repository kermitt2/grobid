			<body>Introduction <lb/>The complete mapping of the human genome 1 brought along <lb/>with it possibilities to better understand human health and its <lb/>determinants which would help improve the way diseases and <lb/>health conditions are managed. Since then, the number of genomic <lb/>research studies and the need for biobanking has been growing <lb/>globally 2-4 , with a steady increase in the number of such studies <lb/>being conducted on the African continent 5 . Further scaling <lb/>up genomics research with samples and data from diverse <lb/>African populations 6 has great value considering that only a small <lb/>portion of human diversity is found outside Africa 7 . Towards <lb/>addressing this gap, a $76 million initiative referred to as <lb/>the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative (H3Africa) <lb/>was funded jointly by the National Institutes of Health in <lb/>the US and Wellcome Trust in the UK 3 . In order to fast-track <lb/>realization of the benefits inherent in genomics research, the <lb/>global community agreed to principles of &apos;open science&apos;, which <lb/>promotes the value of sharing and reuse of data and samples as <lb/>a critical component of the contemporary scientific landscape 8-10 . <lb/>Although this has the strong potential to facilitate scientific dis-<lb/>covery, it also raises a number of ethical concerns which includes <lb/>appropriate model of consent that will allow for such sharing of <lb/>data and samples while upholding participant autonomy 11-14 ; <lb/>issues of withdrawal of consent 15,16 ; ownership of samples <lb/>and data 17-20 ; privacy and confidentiality 15,21-23 ; and benefit <lb/>sharing 24-26 . Such issues are not peculiar to African countries, but <lb/>require a different lens in further elucidating the contextual con-<lb/>cerns in African settings. Furthermore, there are concerns about <lb/>trust 27 and fairness in research collaborations 10,28 , increased <lb/>vulnerability of research participants due to lower socio-<lb/>economic levels, a history of exploitation of local populations <lb/>and researchers 29 , and cultural issues that all must be considered <lb/>in the governance of genomics research and biobanking in <lb/>Africa. <lb/>In addition to these ethical concerns, regulatory frameworks for <lb/>health research in Africa are either non-existent, or where they <lb/>exist, do not respond to the specific concerns raised by genom-<lb/>ics research and biobanking 10,23,30 . Towards addressing this gap, <lb/>the H3Africa Initiative considered it expedient to develop an <lb/>ethics framework describing best practice for genomics research <lb/>and biobanking. Described in terms of core principles and <lb/>elements, the Framework considered African political history <lb/>of exploitations from the West and accounts of ethical <lb/>concerns in conducting genomics research and biobanking 30-33 <lb/>to inform the choice of these core principles and elements. The <lb/>phenomenon of &quot;parachute research&quot; -where fully equipped <lb/>research teams from other countries arrive at the site where <lb/>research is needed, conduct their research independently of <lb/>others, and then leave, has been long cited as a challenge for <lb/>genuine collaborative research in Africa as well as other devel-<lb/>oping countries in the world. That such practices are not <lb/>part of the past was highlighted during the recent Ebola epidemic <lb/>in some West African countries where international research-<lb/>ers are said to have carted specimens away from the affected <lb/>countries without any form of oversight or recourse to local <lb/>regulations or regulators 29 . A permutation of these practices <lb/>is where African researchers are reduced to the role of data and <lb/>sample collectors, without genuine attempts to ensure their <lb/>involvement beyond such functions. One way to remedy such <lb/>practices is by fostering sustainable capacity building for <lb/>African intellectual leadership in the conceptualization, design, <lb/>implementation and reporting of locally appropriate studies 30,34,35 <lb/>-this is one of the core elements of the framework described <lb/>here. It is also one of the main goals of the H3Africa initiative <lb/>including support for equipment and infrastructure to enable <lb/>researchers to develop biobanks and conduct large-scale genomics <lb/>studies. <lb/>The aim of this framework is to guide governance, address sam-<lb/>ple and data sharing concerns, as well as to serve as a resource <lb/>for countries to develop their local regulations. The process <lb/>of engagement that led to the development of this framework is <lb/>reported in another manuscript. This paper highlights the key <lb/>contents of this framework and plans for its implementation <lb/>across the African continent. <lb/>An overarching philosophical basis <lb/>In developing this ethics framework, it was important for key <lb/>stakeholders to identity the overarching philosophical basis that <lb/>should guide the development of ethical best practice for genomic <lb/>research and biobanking. The issues of unfair research collabora-<lb/>tion, lack of trust in research collaborations with scientists from <lb/>the &quot;West&quot; and the related scepticisms among experts and com-<lb/>munity representatives 30,36-38 were key considerations. These <lb/>remain genuine concerns that need to be addressed to promote <lb/>inclusion of Africans in genomics research as the field progresses <lb/>and the world benefits from its outcomes 6 . To ensure that African <lb/>patients and researchers partake in genomic research to optimal <lb/>benefit, we thought it important to adopt a normative basis from <lb/>African cultural philosophy. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is a largely South African <lb/>worldview that focuses on the interrelatedness of humans in their <lb/>quest for mutual co-existence and is one such African philosophy <lb/>that was initially selected as a foundation for the framework 39 . <lb/>However, given its strong historical links to an era of struggle <lb/>in apartheid South Africa and several accounts limiting it as a <lb/>southern African philosophy, its acceptance during our con-<lb/>sultations as a philosophical basis for the framework met with <lb/>some resistance from stakeholders in other parts of Africa. <lb/>Instead, upon consultation we agreed that the framework should <lb/>adopt a more generic communal or solidarity-based worldview. <lb/>Such a worldview recognises that individuals are shaped by <lb/>their relations to people around them and emphasizes respect-<lb/>ful and harmonious relationships between them. In the African <lb/>research context, we agreed that a communitarian perspective <lb/>would place central importance on reciprocity, consultation and <lb/>accountability as key ethical values. <lb/>Core Principles and Elements <lb/>The framework proposes a set of five core principles that ought <lb/>to underpin guidance for genomic research and biobanking <lb/>initiatives in Africa. Whilst these principles are not new, they need <lb/>to keep of being emphasized to address particular concerns of <lb/>African communities and scientists regarding trust and unfair-<lb/>ness in research collaborations. A number of these principles have <lb/>been echoed in a parallel initiative, the San Code of Ethics, which <lb/></body>

			<body>seeks to define how researchers ought to conduct their work when <lb/>dealing with the San population in South Africa 40,41 . The five core <lb/>principles of our framework emphasize the need for research <lb/>to: a) be sensitive and respectful of African values and cultures; <lb/>b) be designed primarily to benefit the African people, while <lb/>acknowledged it may equally benefit the global population; <lb/>c) ensure genuine and active intellectual participation of African <lb/>investigators and other stakeholders in research and in dissemi-<lb/>nation of findings; and d) promote relationships characterised <lb/>by respect, fairness, equity and reciprocity. As core principles, <lb/>these aspects are non-negotiable and should be incorporated in <lb/>the design and conduct of genomics research and biobanking <lb/>initiatives in Africa. <lb/>Key elements of the Framework for Best Practice <lb/>In addition to these core principles, the Framework also describes <lb/>ten key areas that need to be addressed in order to ensure that <lb/>the core principles elucidated in the framework are realised. <lb/>They include: African intellectual leadership; Consent; Com-<lb/>munity engagement; Ethics review; Avoidance of group harm <lb/>and stigma; Benefit sharing; Capacity building; International <lb/>collaboration and export of samples; Feedback of individual <lb/>genetic findings; and Good governance. These core elements <lb/>are not mutually exclusive. For instance, high-level capacity <lb/>building is key to ensuring African intellectual leadership. <lb/>Highlights of the key elements of the framework <lb/>Because sample and data sharing are essential to genomics <lb/>research and biobanking, it is important that the consent proc-<lb/>ess allows sharing and re-use whilst still respecting participant <lb/>choice. While there are several models of informed consent that <lb/>may support genomics research 42 , our framework promotes the <lb/>use of broad consent. It is important to differentiate this from <lb/>blanket consent, which is consent for sharing and use of data and <lb/>specimen without any restrictions. Broad consent as under-<lb/>stood in the framework allows for &quot;use of samples and/or data <lb/>for unspecified future studies, but with conditions. These con-<lb/>ditions can involve, for instance a restriction on the types of <lb/>studies or diseases that samples/data can be used for; a speci-<lb/>fied oversight and approval process for future use; ongoing <lb/>consultation with sample donors about future use, if possible; <lb/>and a process allowing participants to withdraw samples or <lb/>data from the storage facility that holds them&quot;. Although debates <lb/>about appropriate consent models for genomics and biobank-<lb/>ing continue, there is growing consensus that it may be the &apos;best <lb/>compromise&apos; consent model 43 . In their critical presentation of the <lb/>outcomes of a workshop which aimed to identify the appropri-<lb/>ate consent model for collection of biospecimen for use in future <lb/>research, Grady et al. (2015) submitted that broad con-<lb/>sent was considered &quot;ethically appropriate, and preferable <lb/>to lack of consent for the majority of biospecimen collec-<lb/>tion for future research uses&quot; 42 . Furthermore, Tindana and De <lb/>Vries (2016) in their paper on the perspectives of broad consent <lb/>for genomics research in LMICs concluded that there are no <lb/>a priori reasons against the use of broad consent for genom-<lb/>ics research in Africa 44 . Empirical research conducted since <lb/>then suggests that participants may also be supportive of broad <lb/>consent if done sensitively and respectfully 45-47 . The proposed <lb/>framework for acceptable broad consent includes initial <lb/>consent, oversight of future research projects, and, when feasi-<lb/>ble, mechanisms for maintaining contact and communication with <lb/>specimen donors. There is, however, an agreement among most <lb/>proponents of broad consent that for optimal participant protec-<lb/>tion, whenever broad consent is used in genomics research to <lb/>allow for future research use, it needs to be accompanied with a <lb/>mechanism that promotes accountability and equity 48 in sharing <lb/>specimen and/or data with other researchers while also <lb/>ensuring that participants&apos; choice are respected 42,44 . <lb/>The Framework considers that genuine community engage-<lb/>ment is a key component of ensuring best practice in genom-<lb/>ics research and biobanking in Africa, not in the least because it <lb/>promotes respect for community values and perspectives and <lb/>maximizes the social value of research 49 . Community engage-<lb/>ment is one way to ensure that research conduct is aligned with <lb/>a communitarian worldview. Furthermore, genuine commu-<lb/>nity engagement is proposed as a condition for the use of broad <lb/>consent 42,44 . Community engagement should take place along <lb/>the entire spectrum of research activities, from initial planning <lb/>phases and data collection, to include the return of general study <lb/>findings when projects end. <lb/>The framework recommends that all primary genomic research <lb/>and biobanking studies must be reviewed by a competent research <lb/>ethics review committee based in the country where samples are <lb/>collected or stored. Research ethics review fulfils an important <lb/>role in promoting ethical best practice and is key to the protec-<lb/>tion of research participants Such a role is very important in the <lb/>African research that takes place in the context of a high bur-<lb/>den of disease, poor access to basic necessities and healthcare, <lb/>low average income and literacy levels as well as unfamiliar-<lb/>ity of most of the people with biomedical research generally and <lb/>genomic research specifically. A particular challenge is the lim-<lb/>ited capacity of research ethics committees in Africa to review <lb/>genomics research and biobanking projects 50,51 . Using a matrix <lb/>that maps the various elements of this framework against impor-<lb/>tant issues that ethics committees are recommended to consider, <lb/>Table 1 is proposed as a practical tool for ethics committees to <lb/>provide oversight for good governance in genomics research and <lb/>biobanking. <lb/>The avoidance of group harm or stigma is considered impor-<lb/>tant particularly in the African research context where research-<lb/>ers may work with members of many different population groups, <lb/>each characterised by their own language, culture and belief <lb/>systems, some of which may be marginalised or discriminated <lb/>against. Research may also involve groups of people suffering <lb/>from stigmatised conditions or outlawed or stigmatising behav-<lb/>iours, phenotypes or lifestyles. In such a context, the reporting of <lb/>genomic research results could aggravate existing stigma or mar-<lb/>ginalisation. An example is the way in which genomic research <lb/>on the San included findings that were considered potentially <lb/>stigmatising 41 . In this example, Namibian San leaders were <lb/>approached for participation in genomics research 52 , without <lb/></body>

			<body>involvement of San political leadership or individuals with expe-<lb/>rience in science who could have properly explained the research <lb/>project and who could have helped the research team in design-<lb/>ing more appropriate consent processes. Whilst presented inter-<lb/>nationally as an example of &apos;best practice&apos; for the involvement of <lb/>&apos;indigenous&apos; African populations 53 , this project, as well as its <lb/>inconsiderate presentation of research results, was perceived <lb/>as deeply offensive by the Namibian and South African San <lb/>Councils and led to the development of the San Code for Ethics <lb/>referenced earlier. <lb/>Because of this and other experiences, the framework requires <lb/>researchers to be mindful of whether and how groups are <lb/>identified in genomics research, and how research results are <lb/>reported. Importantly, the framework suggests that commu-<lb/>nity engagement may be one way to alleviate the potential for <lb/>stigma. Genuine intellectual leadership by senior African <lb/>researchers and their meaningful involvement in the prepara-<lb/>tion of manuscripts is equally important to ensure the respectful <lb/>engagement with African populations and the responsible <lb/>reporting of study findings. <lb/>In terms of benefit sharing, the framework proposes that <lb/>genomics research and biobanking may bring intangible <lb/>benefits in the form of general study results, social recogni-<lb/>tion, knowledge production and translation of relevant knowl-<lb/>edge to healthcare practice. Whilst there may be some tangible <lb/>benefits emanating from genomics research and biobanking in the <lb/>form of (patentable) innovations or technologies, these are rare <lb/>and should not be the focus of benefit sharing discussions. The <lb/>framework describes, first, that it is imperative that research-<lb/>ers ensure that intangible benefits accrue to researchers and <lb/>communities and they should be aware of this. It also describes <lb/>that researchers should be mindful not to raise unrealistic expecta-<lb/>tions, and to clearly describe to communities and individuals the <lb/>nature of potential benefits they can expect and those that they <lb/>cannot. <lb/>Capacity building for African scientists is one of the cen-<lb/>tral elements of the framework, and has been identified as one <lb/>of the primary benefits emanating out of ongoing research <lb/>endeavours such as H3Africa 25,54 . Building a critical mass <lb/>of scholars in genomics and biobanking is essential to ensure <lb/>the sustainability of these research approaches in Africa. <lb/>Similarly, such a critical mass is needed to ensure that this <lb/>research can be conducted by African research teams and under <lb/>African intellectual leadership in the future, provided that capac-<lb/>ity is built along the entire academic hierarchy and includes <lb/>junior scientists as well as more senior ones. Importantly, <lb/>capacity building would need to focus not just on training in <lb/>genomics science and bioinformatics, but also in grants admin-<lb/>istration, contract negotiation, ethics and in transferable skills <lb/>such as grant writing which enables sustainability of the <lb/>genomics research. The expectation is that broad capacity build-<lb/>ing would ensure that research is responsive to the health needs <lb/>of Africans, is sensitive to African ethical, legal and social <lb/>issues, and that there is a strong avenue for the implementation <lb/>of relevant research findings into national health policy and <lb/>clinical practice. <lb/>With regard to the export of samples to other countries, the <lb/>framework acknowledges that this is often viewed as problem-<lb/>atic by research ethics committees and other regulators, not in <lb/>the least because it is viewed as perpetuating inequality. For <lb/>this reason, the framework proposes that export should only be <lb/>permitted where researchers can outline how their work will <lb/>contribute to reducing global health inequality and what measures <lb/>they have put in place to strengthen the research system in the <lb/>country where the samples were collected. One example would <lb/>be where junior and senior African students and researchers <lb/>are meaningfully involved in all aspects of the research process, <lb/>including aspects that happen in non-African laboratories and <lb/>universities. Material Transfer Agreements are fundamental to <lb/>underpin the fair export of samples, and guidance offered for <lb/>instance by the <lb/>Whilst the framework offers some guidance on the feedback <lb/>of individual genetic research results, it mainly proposes <lb/>a range of questions that need to be considered in determin-<lb/>ing whether and under which conditions the return of research <lb/>results may be appropriate in the African research context. <lb/>Given the complexity of the issues, the H3Africa Consortium <lb/>is developing a policy guiding researchers in how to decide <lb/>which results to feedback, which expands on the summary <lb/>guidance given in the framework. <lb/>Lastly, implementing a good governance regime is recom-<lb/>mended in order to tie all these elements together towards <lb/>optimal protection of participant in genomics research and <lb/>biobanking. This should be a mechanism that provides oversight <lb/>for re-use of samples and data sharing in line with the princi-<lb/>ples and elements set out in the framework. Such oversight is <lb/>expected to among other things, ensure that decisions to provide <lb/>access to sample and data for secondary use are sensitive <lb/>to the need to promote genomics scholarship from African <lb/>scientists and facilitate preferential use of data and access to <lb/>samples for such scientists for a reasonable period of time. <lb/>Such a preferential use provision is expected to further support <lb/>African scientists, who may have challenges in engaging with <lb/>the data and specimen available as fast as their counterparts <lb/>due to systemic challenges such as poor power supply, poor <lb/>access to academic databases for research, poor access to fast <lb/>and reliable internet and so forth; or infrastructural challenges <lb/>such as the availability of databases with comparable secu-<lb/>rity protections that will allow for sharing data across coun-<lb/>tries and continents. In making these decisions however, it is <lb/>important to find an appropriate balance between over-<lb/>protection, which may hinder good science with potential <lb/>benefit to humanity derivable from it. Typically, such a govern-<lb/>ance regime is achieved through the establishment of Sample <lb/>Access Committees and Data Access Committee 55 . However, <lb/>each country that seeks to use the framework, as a guide may <lb/>have to develop a structure that works best considering local <lb/>peculiarities. <lb/></body>

			<body>Implementation mechanisms and amendments <lb/>The next step in our quest to consolidate and harmonize standards <lb/>for African genomics research and biobanking is to engage broadly <lb/>around the framework, and to develop template guidelines for <lb/>adaptation. <lb/>Firstly, the framework provides the basis for further discus-<lb/>sions and engagement with professional organisations, regulators <lb/>and ethics committees across Africa. Through our consultation <lb/>processes, we have built up a rich network of contacts with reg-<lb/>ulators and ethics committees at local, regional and national <lb/>levels across the continent, and we are liaising with all of these <lb/>to create awareness of the minimal standards described in the <lb/>Framework. We are also liaising with professional science <lb/>organisations including for instance the African Academy of <lb/>Sciences (AAS), to explore how that organisation can take a <lb/>leadership role in advancing ethical standards of genomics <lb/>research and biobanking on the continent. <lb/>In terms of ensuring the incorporation of the standards outlined <lb/>in the Framework into research practice, we are prepar-<lb/>ing more detailed guidelines that expand on the items in the <lb/>Framework. This resource will be publicly available for use <lb/>by ethics committees across the continent, and the hope is <lb/>that ethics committees and national ethics councils will adapt <lb/>and adopt the guidelines so that they become the gold standard <lb/>for national regulation of genomics and biobanking. In order to <lb/>ensure that they do, we will continue our engagement activities <lb/>with committees and national councils.

This is different, as is the focus on the &quot;..central importance on reciprocity, consultation <lb/>and accountability&apos;. This draws a clear distinction between the proposed African model and <lb/>conventional western participant-focused ethical approaches, which can accompany &quot;parachute <lb/>research&quot;, mentioned in the Introduction. <lb/>The article details the elements of this African best-practice genomics and biobanking framework <lb/>based on &quot;African intellectual leadership; Consent; Community engagement; Ethics review; <lb/>Avoidance of group harm and stigma; Benefit sharing; Capacity building; International <lb/>collaboration and export of samples; Feedback of individual genetic findings; and Good <lb/>governance. <lb/>The implementation agenda for the H3Africa framework is briefly set out.

The authors of <lb/>this article are to be commended for this important work. <lb/>Overall, the manuscript will make an important contribution. We have only minor suggestions for <lb/>improvement. Although the key elements of the framework are well-presented, the authors do not address <lb/>potential challenges that may be encountered while applying those key elements. We realise that the <lb/>purpose of the article is to lay out the framework, and so does not address implementation issues. <lb/>However, some additional detail may be good to add, in particular in the context of community <lb/>engagement, which the authors emphasize as a key component for ensuring best practice in genomics <lb/>research and biobanking in Africa. However, it is not clear from the framework what the authors mean by <lb/>&quot;genuine community engagement&quot;. There is a rich literature on engaging community members in research <lb/>and the values and challenges of doing so. Community engagement goes beyond the meaningful <lb/>involvement of African researchers to include individuals from the broader population and specific groups, <lb/>and will need to address issues such as power dynamics between researchers who are considered <lb/>experts and community members. <lb/>Other issues: <lb/>On p. 3. The authors mention that &quot;The process of engagement that led to the development of this <lb/>framework is reported in another manuscript.&quot; A reference to this manuscript should be provided. <lb/>The paragraph on export of samples to other countries is incomplete (p. 6). <lb/>The &quot;implementation mechanisms and amendments&quot; section (p. 7) describes the next steps for raising <lb/>awareness and engaging health organisations and national councils with the framework. It would be great <lb/>to have more detail regarding future evaluation of the framework and the Working Group&apos;s engagement <lb/>activities. <lb/>Is the rationale for the Open Letter provided in sufficient detail? <lb/>Yes <lb/>Does the article adequately reference differing views and opinions? <lb/>Partly <lb/>Are all factual statements correct, and are statements and arguments made adequately <lb/>supported by citations? <lb/>Yes <lb/>Is the Open Letter written in accessible language? <lb/>Yes <lb/>Where applicable, are recommendations and next steps explained clearly for others to follow? <lb/>Yes <lb/>No competing interests were disclosed. <lb/>Competing Interests: <lb/>We have read this submission.
