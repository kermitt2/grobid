			<body>For many years lithium niobate (LiNbO 3 ) has been among the most widely used materials in photonics 1 . The <lb/>continuing popularity of LiNbO 3 in this area originates from its highly desirable properties, such as large <lb/>electro-optic, acousto-optic, piezoelectric and nonlinear optical coefficients, and its quite easy production in <lb/>a single-domain state 2,3 . Moreover, this material has recently been proposed as optically active substrate for the <lb/>realization of microfluidic devices 4,5 , thus paving the way for its use in the optofluidic field. On the other hand, <lb/>liquid crystals (LC) are known for their sensitiveness to external stimuli, among which optical and electric fields <lb/>are widely used in photonics and display applications 6,7 . The possibility of combining these two materials, thus <lb/>taking advantage of the peculiarities of both, was recently demonstrated 8-11 . In particular, the light-induced con-<lb/>trol of the optical phase shift by a liquid crystal cell having LiNbO 3 substrates 8,9 and the generation and manip-<lb/>ulation of defects in LC films deposited on LiNbO 3 crystals 10,11 , have been reported. In all these papers, the key <lb/>role is played by the bulk photovoltaic effect which arises in LiNbO 3 under illumination 12 . This effect is observed <lb/>in non-centrosymmetric crystals and its microscopic nature is connected to the probability of electron transition <lb/>from a state with momentum k to a state of momentum k&apos; , which is not equal to the probability of the reverse <lb/>transition 13 . The resulting asymmetric momentum distribution gives rise to the appearance of a photocurrent that <lb/>depends on the square of the optical field 12,13 . In open circuit conditions, the charge distribution produced by the <lb/>photocurrent creates an electric field, known as photovoltaic field. Doping LiNbO 3 with iron strongly enhances <lb/>the effect 12,14 by introducing electron donor (Fe 2+ ions) and acceptor (Fe 3+ ions) centres, and the photovoltaic <lb/>field can become as high as 10 7 V/m. It appears clear that the possibility to convert optical fields into electric fields <lb/>offered by LiNbO 3 conveniently combines with the LC high sensitivity to external fields. <lb/>Specifically, reference 8 describes the possibility of using the charge separation associated to the photovoltaic <lb/>effect in iron doped LiNbO 3 (LiNbO 3 :Fe) to optically induce a static electric field able to reorient the molecular <lb/>director in properly designed liquid crystal cells. In a subsequent paper 9 a detailed analysis of the electric field <lb/>generated by light irradiation in such lithium niobate-based liquid crystal cells, has been reported. The key point <lb/>of these studies is the possibility of designing a new road map in the field of materials available for optofluidics, <lb/>where the optically generated electric fields of LiNbO 3 :Fe can be conveniently used and configured to drive liquid <lb/>crystal molecular orientation, thus allowing the fabrication of novel all optical microfluidic devices with a high <lb/>degree of compactness. <lb/></body>

			<body>With the aim of further investigating this possibility, in this work we study the response of nematic LC to the <lb/>electric field optically induced in lithium niobate in microfluidic configuration. The fields coming into play are <lb/>actually two, since, due to the high light intensity resulting from beam focusing, the pyroelectric field arising from <lb/>laser heating cannot be neglected and its effect combines with that of the photovoltaic field creating an additional <lb/>degree of freedom for controlling the LC response. <lb/>The microfluidic chip, made entirely of LiNbO 3 :Fe, consists of a rectangular microfluidic channel with two <lb/>entrances (inlets and outlets) connected to the outside, formed by two symmetrical halves sealed together per-<lb/>fectly one above the other. The microchannel were filled with a nematic liquid crystal using a special syringe con-<lb/>nector and the optical response of the resulting optofluidic chip was studied. Results show that the liquid crystals <lb/>molecular orientation is affected by the electric fields induced in the photoactivated crystals. Although the system <lb/>requires further optimization, the obtained results show several peculiar features such as the fast response time <lb/>and the possibility of combining the photovoltaic and the pyroelectric fields in order to get a further control on <lb/>the light induced LC reorientation when it is confined to micrometric geometries. <lb/>Experimental Details <lb/>The two LiNbO 3 :Fe substrates have been obtained from a boule grown at the University of Padua by the Czochralski <lb/>technique. The boule presents a congruent composition with a dopant concentration c Fe = 18.8 × 10 18 at/cm 3 <lb/>(0.1% mol). It was poled in air at 1200 °C, that is above the Curie temperature of the material, in order to get a <lb/>single domain structure and X-Ray Diffraction measurements were realized for checking the optical quality of <lb/>the sample. Then the boule was oriented along the three crystallographic axes of the material and cut in samples <lb/>with the main faces perpendicular to the c-axis of lithium niobate (z-cut crystals). Finally the two LiNbO 3 :Fe sub-<lb/>strates were polished by means of a Logitech PM5 lapping machine to achieve optical quality of the main surfaces. <lb/>Then they underwent a reduction thermal treatment at 500 °C in a gas mixture of Ar (98%) +H 2 (2%), up to a <lb/>reduction degree R = Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ of 0.07, as measured by optical absorption 15 . <lb/>The microfluidic channels have been engraved in the obtained crystals at the laboratories of the Center <lb/>of NanoScience and Technology of the Instituto Italiano di Tecnologia (CNST@IIT) of Milan, through a <lb/>micromachining facility consisting in an amplified 10 W femtosecond laser (Pharos, Light Conversion), pro-<lb/>viding (80-300) fs duration pulses at four wavelengths (1030 nm fundamental, 2nd, 3th and 4fh harmonic) and <lb/>1 MHz repetition rate. High precision and nanometer resolution air-bearing computer-controlled motion stages <lb/>(Aerotech ABL1000), have been used to translate the samples. <lb/>The highly localized nonlinear interaction provided by focused femtosecond laser pulses allows for <lb/>sub-wavelength feature sizes smaller than the diffraction limited spot size, unlike linear absorption in long pulse <lb/>laser processing. Based on the writing fluency (pulse energy/focal area), different materials properties modifi-<lb/>cation can be obtained, from soft (the change of refractive index) to hard (material ablation), in 3D and even <lb/>inside the bulk, simply moving the sample in relation to the spot position. This innovative chip manufacturing <lb/>technique has different advantages compared to traditional photolithographic and etching techniques since it <lb/>does not require a clean room and, above all, is a maskless direct-write process. In the microfluidic platforms <lb/>in which quartz is the ideal material the most common method of femtosecond pulse laser microfabrication is <lb/>the formation of periodic nanoplanes that are later etched by hydrofluoric (HF) acid. Although this technique <lb/>has shown amazing ability to quickly fabricate precise and controllable-roughness 3D microfluidic circuits, also <lb/>buried in the substrate 16 , it is not suitable for all materials. Laser assisted etching in lithium niobate has never <lb/>been reported and attempts of etching LiNbO 3 :Fe crystals with HF after laser ablation, made at CNST did not <lb/>give any result. Therefore direct laser ablation have been used, which normally does not guarantee low roughness <lb/>of the microchannel walls if it is carried out without specific precaution. In order to reduce surface roughness, <lb/>the chip was thus created in controlled atmosphere by superficially ablating its two halves in a vacuum chamber <lb/>(10 −2 Pa), as shown in Fig. 1a. Two microchannels of rectangular section (200 × 25 µm (width × height)) have <lb/>been realized (Fig. 1c). The low pressure allows reducing the surface roughness of the obtained microchannels by <lb/>promoting the separation of the ablated material from the crystal bulk. In this way the low size debris created by <lb/>femtosecond ablation (tens of nanometers in diameter) are free to &quot;fly&quot; away from the unprocessed area thanks to <lb/>the increase in their average free path and to the low kinetic energy possessed. The writing parameters (as well as <lb/>the used objective) deeply affect the residual roughness so that the one of the side walls results almost an order of <lb/>Figure 1. (a) Pictorial representation of the femtosecond micromachining writing procedure in controlled <lb/>atmosphere; (b) sketch of the chip geometry; (c) optical microscope image of the chip: top and section views. <lb/></body>

			<body>magnitude lower than that of bottom and top sides 16 . Worthy of note, surface roughness reduction in lithium nio-<lb/>bate thin films by femtosecond micromachining in water were also proposed, showing that the ablation debris can <lb/>be more efficiently removed with the assistance of water and the cavitation process triggered by the ultra-short <lb/>pulse significantly reduces the size of the debris 17 . However, this &quot;wet&quot; process is not easy to implement, does not <lb/>support high writing speeds and is not particularly suitable to long time and/or large area chip fabrications (few <lb/>mm square). Furthermore, a high temperature annealing treatment of the sample is almost always necessary to <lb/>achieve a satisfactory residual roughness and this may affect the LiNbO 3 :Fe properties. <lb/>Before sealing the two halves to obtain the final optofluidic chip, SiO x has been deposited on the microchannel <lb/>surfaces by vacuum technique in order to promote planar alignment of the LC along the channel axis. Then, the <lb/>two halves were assembled paying particular attention to the alignment one above the other and sealed with a <lb/>UV curable glue (Fig. 1b). The small section connecting tubes for LC inlet and outlet, fixed with the same glue <lb/>conclude the manufacture. <lb/>The obtained microfluidic chip was then filled with the nematic eutectic mixture E7. A picture of the filled <lb/>microchannel under a polarizing optical microscope is shown in Fig. 2. The image is taken with the axis of the <lb/>polarizer parallel to the channel length, while keeping the analyzer crossed. The two enlarged views show the <lb/>increase of light transmittance typical of planar alignment when the sample is rotated by 45° with respect to the <lb/>polarizer axis. It is worth noting that the LC is at rest in the experiments here reported. A few measurements with <lb/>the LC flowing in the microchannel have been performed and gave results comparable to those here described. <lb/>Pump-probe experiments were performed in the conventional geometry: the pump beam is provided by the <lb/>green line of a cw Ar ion laser (λ = 514 nm) focused to a waist of 30 µm in correspondence of the microchannel <lb/>central region, where it impinges at normal incidence. In this configuration, light propagates along the c axis of <lb/>both LiNbO 3 :Fe crystals and, being linearly polarized in the cell plane, it does not undergo any phase shift due to <lb/>the crystals birefringence. Pump light is linearly polarized parallel to the microchannel axis and its power varies <lb/>in the range (40-80) mW, which leads to a pump intensity I in the range (1.5-3) × 10 3 W/cm 2 . A mechanical <lb/>shutter enabled performing irradiation cycles, which in the experiments here reported had 1 s duration and 2 s <lb/>dark time separation. The probe beam originates from a low-power He-Ne laser (λ = 633 nm) focused to a waist <lb/>of 20 µm and counter propagating with respect to the green pump beam. Probe polarization is linear and forms an <lb/>angle of 45° with that of the pump. The probe light transmitted by the sample, orthogonally polarized with respect <lb/>to the incident one, was detected by a photodiode connected to a pc. It is worth noting that the initial configura-<lb/>tion is the one corresponding to the maximum light transmission. Each variation of the LC birefringence should <lb/>lead to a decrease of the signal detected by the photodiode. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>Pump irradiation of the LC filled microchannel leads to a decrease of the probe transmission for each value of the <lb/>used power. This latter affects the amount of transmission variation, which increases by increasing the impinging <lb/>pump power, and, to a lower extent, the response time. A typical example of the signal detected is shown in Fig. 3. <lb/>The two exponential fits, represented by the red lines, allows to evaluate the response times. The inset reports the <lb/>whole curve. <lb/>From these and similar data we determined both the amplitude of the transmission variation ΔI T and the <lb/>response (on and off) times as a function of the pump power. Results are shown in Fig. 4. The transmission <lb/>Figure 2. Polarizing optical microscope picture of the filled microchannel.

			<body>variation is linear in the pump power as shown by the linear fit in Fig. 4a. The threshold character of the induced <lb/>response is also evident. Both the response times are on the order of hundreds of ms and show a weak dependence <lb/>on the pump intensity. In particular, the on time is higher for low values of the incident light intensity, which <lb/>could be an indication of a lower value of the stimulus responsible for the observed birefringence change. The off <lb/>times shows a slight increase for higher intensity, which may be the indication of the onset of some memory effect <lb/>in the light-induced modification of lithium niobate charge distribution, similarly to what happen in thermal <lb/>fixing mechanisms. Indeed, measurements performed by increasing the exposure time lead to signal relaxation to <lb/>values different from the unperturbed ones. <lb/>It is worth noting that measurements performed before filling the microchannel with E7 did not show any <lb/>variation of the probe light transmission, thus ruling out any effect due to the birefringence of the lithium nio-<lb/>bate substrates. Moreover, light irradiation of conventional LC planar cells with the same parameters used in the <lb/>experiments described above, did not result in any birefringence variation. <lb/>A few measurements filling the microchannels with 5CB have also been performed but the obtained results, <lb/>although demonstrating the possibility of modulating the LC refractive index, are not reliable due to heating of <lb/>the LC generated by green light absorption in the lithium niobate substrates. Indeed the transition temperature <lb/>to the isotropic state of 5CB is T N/I ≅ 33 °C, and the parameters determining the LC response to external electric <lb/>fields (such as refractive indexes, viscosity and dielectric properties) are quite sensitive to temperature variations <lb/>close to room temperature. That is light absorption can easily lead to thermal instabilities. The use of E7 avoids <lb/>these kind of troubles because of the higher transition temperature (T N/I ≅ 60 °C). <lb/>Pump probe measurements were then repeated by reverting the sample, that is by irradiating the opposite <lb/>surface of the microfluidic chip so that the light wave vector and the lithium niobate c-axis change their mutual <lb/>direction (see Fig. 7 further on). The results obtained in this latter configuration are shown in Fig. 5. Besides being <lb/>lower than that reported in Fig. 3, the detected signal is now independent on the pump intensity (Fig. 5b). The <lb/>response times are both of the same order of those reported in Fig. 4b,c. <lb/>The observed change in probe light transmission is the signature of the phase shift undergone by the light <lb/>travelling along the LC filled microchannel. This on its turn is due to a change of the effective refractive index for <lb/>the wave travelling through the LC cell. There are basically two possible reasons for the effective refractive index <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>variation upon light irradiation: heating of the LiNbO 3 :Fe substrates and, consequently, of the LC in the micro-<lb/>channel, and director reorientation in the electric field induced by light in the LiNbO 3 :Fe substrates. <lb/>Light-induced heating of the substrates has to be taken into account, since the wavelength of the pump beam <lb/>is in the absorption band of LiNbO 3 :Fe crystals used here as optofluidic platform. Specifically, the absorption <lb/>coefficient measured at λ = 514 nm for each crystal, based on the relation between incident I 0 and transmitted I T <lb/>intensity through an absorbing slab of thickness d and absorption coefficient α: <lb/>α <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>I <lb/>I <lb/>d <lb/>exp( <lb/>) <lb/>(1) <lb/>T <lb/>0 <lb/>is 5 cm −1 .

In the <lb/>experimental configuration used w = 30 µm, d = 900 µm and I is in the range (1.5-3) × 10 3 W/cm 2 . Using for K <lb/>the value 10 −2 cal/s/cm/°C 3 valid for undoped crystals (which is expected to be lower than the one of iron doped <lb/>crystals), the maximum temperature rise at steady state ranges between 2 and 4 °C. This may induce heating of <lb/>the LC with a consequent change of the effective refractive index seen by the probe light travelling along the LC <lb/>region. However, results shown in Fig. 5 clearly rules out LC heating as possible responsible of the observed var-<lb/>iation of probe transmission, because this effect should not produce any asymmetric behavior. The two lithium <lb/>niobate substrates that compose the microfluidic chip are identical, so the light induced heating of the LC slab is <lb/>expected to be the same whatever surface is the one directly irradiated by the pump beam. The temperature rise <lb/>is apparently not high enough to induce a significant variation of the LC effective refractive index. Indeed using <lb/>E7, such an effect is expected to come into play at even higher intensity where the temperature rise is greater and <lb/>the induced variation of the extraordinary refractive index is high enough to give rise to a detectable amount of <lb/>birefringence variation. Measurements performed with a pump intensity as high as 150 mW seem to confirm <lb/>this hypothesis, as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the decreasing part of the signal requires a double exponential fit <lb/>function, which produces two different characteristic times, one &quot;fast&quot; of the order of ten ms and one &quot;slow&quot; of <lb/>the order of hundreds of ms. Further increase of the pump intensity confirms this behaviour. The fast part of the <lb/>signal, observed just for pump intensity higher than the maximum one used in this manuscript, is likely to be due <lb/>to LC heating and consequent refractive index variation. <lb/>Concerning the second possible effect, namely director reorientation under the electric field induced by light <lb/>in lithium niobate, it has already been demonstrated for LC planar cells having LiNbO 3 :Fe substrates 8,9,19 . In those <lb/>cases, LC reorientation was driven by the photovoltaic field generated in the two substrates by light irradiation. In <lb/>the experiments discussed here, due to beam focusing required to irradiate an area inside the microchannel, the <lb/>impinging intensity is higher which results in a higher temperature increase (with the values discussed above). In <lb/>these conditions, the pyroelectric field can also come into play. Such a field depends on the temperature variation <lb/>according to the relation 20 : <lb/>ε ε <lb/>= − <lb/>Δ <lb/>E <lb/>p T <lb/>1 <lb/>(3) <lb/>py <lb/>r <lb/>0 <lb/>where p is the pyroelectric coefficient of the material. This parameter depends on the variation of spontaneous <lb/>polarization with temperature and for congruent LiNbO 3 crystals is p ≅ (8 × 10 −5 ) C/m 2 °C21 . Specifically, heating <lb/>due to light absorption is known to produce the so called secondary pyroelectricity 22 , an effect where the polariza-<lb/>tion is induced piezoelectrically due to the temperature induced stress and deformations of the crystal. This effect <lb/>has been proved to produce macroscopic charge separation 22 , it can thus combine with the photovoltaic effect. <lb/>The dependence of the detected birefringence variation on the particular irradiated surface, which is evident <lb/>comparing Figs 3 and 4 with Fig. 5, demonstrates that the effect is due to the actions of the electric fields induced <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>by light irradiation on the LiNbO 3 crystals and indicates that the two fields combine in different ways in the two <lb/>different situations. In our experimental conditions both the photovoltaic field and the field due to the secondary <lb/>pyroelectric effect have the direction of the c axis, which is also the direction of light propagation. Specifically, since <lb/>the photovoltaic field can be parallel or antiparallel to the light wave-vector depending on which surface the beam <lb/>is impinging on and assuming that the pyroelectric field is antiparallel to the temperature gradient 20 , the two fields <lb/>can sum up or compensate to a certain extent depending on which is the irradiated surface. To better understand <lb/>this point let us consider the sketch in Fig. 7a. Here the pump light impinges on the first crystal on the side where <lb/>the positive charge develops, which gives rise to a photovoltaic field opposite to the light wave-vector. The pyroe-<lb/>lectric field is in the same direction, since the temperature gradient is along the light wave-vector. In this situation <lb/>the two fields are parallel and sum up their contributions. By reverting the sample, as in Fig. 7b, light impinges now <lb/>on the surface where negative charges accumulates, thus inverting the direction of the photovoltaic field while the <lb/>pyroelectric field direction does not change. The two fields are now antiparallel to each other and subtract. <lb/>Worthy of note, the primary pyroelectric effect cannot combine with the photovoltaic one in the way <lb/>described, since under its action negative charges move in the +Z direction in both the situations depicted in <lb/>Fig. 7, that is the primary pyroelectric field is in both cases parallel to the photovoltaic field. <lb/>The dependence of the induced response on the impinging intensity can give us a hint on which of the two <lb/>fields is playing the major role in the two situations. As shown in Fig. 4a, the amount of transmission variation in <lb/>the configuration shown in Fig. 7a increases linearly with the power of the pump beam, thus indicating that the <lb/>field inducing the birefringence change is on its turn intensity-dependent. The pyroelectric field, being induced <lb/>by temperature variation, is expected to depend linearly on the amount of light irradiation. On the other hand <lb/>it is known that the photovoltaic field optically induced in iron doped LiNbO 3 crystals is independent on light <lb/>intensity for values lower than 10 7 W/m 2 and becomes intensity dependent for higher values of I, as predicted by <lb/>the so-called &quot;two-center model&quot; 12 . Specifically, the photovoltaic field can be written as the sum of two terms: the <lb/>field due to iron ions and the one due to polarons. This latter dominates at high intensity due to the appearance of <lb/>a contribution to the current density that increases quadratically with I. Similarly, the photoconductivity presents <lb/>two terms, which are proportional to I and I 2 , respectively. However, for the dopant concentration and the light <lb/>intensities used in this work the second contribution is almost five orders of magnitude lower than the former <lb/>one (σ (I) ∼ 10 −8 Ω −1 m −1 , σ (I 2 ) ∼ 10 −14 Ω −1 m −1 ), as it can be easily derived by the coefficients reported in 23 . <lb/>Since the dominant term in photoconductivity is linear in I, one expects the photovoltaic field at high intensity <lb/>to be composed by an intensity independent term plus a term linearly dependent on I. The different behaviour <lb/>observed in the two configurations discussed, thus suggests the following scenario. <lb/>The total space charge field in the configuration shown in Fig. 7a can be written as: <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>E <lb/>E I <lb/>E <lb/>E I <lb/>E I <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>(4a) <lb/>sc <lb/>PV <lb/>PV <lb/>py <lb/>sc <lb/>Where as the total space charge in the opposite configuration (Fig. 7b) becomes: <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>E <lb/>E I <lb/>E <lb/>E I <lb/>E <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>(4b) <lb/>sc <lb/>PV <lb/>PV <lb/>py <lb/>PV <lb/>in the hypothesis of a total compensation of the two intensity dependent terms. Indeed, according to the <lb/>two-center model 12 the expected intensity-independent component of the photovoltaic field can be calculated <lb/>to be in the range (6-8) × 10 6 V/m, whereas the intensity-dependent component is predicted to vary from <lb/>9 × 10 5 V/m at 40 mW to 2 × 10 6 V/m at 80 mW, being comparable with the electric field induced by tempera-<lb/>ture gradients. This latter can be evaluated by assuming a temperature gradient in the range (2-4) × 10 3 K/m <lb/>(ΔT = (2-4) °C along a 900 µm thick crystal), to be of the order of 10 6 V/m. Full compensation of the intensity <lb/>dependent terms by means of pyroelectric effects in the configuration depicted in Fig. 7b, is thus reasonable. <lb/>Worthy of note the threshold observed in both Figs 4a and 5b, is typical of LC reorientation under the action <lb/>of an external field orthogonal to the unperturbed optic axis 18 , The spatial profile of the photovoltaic field in the <lb/>region in between two z-cut LiNbO 3 :Fe substrates has been calculated in 9 and the main contribution has been <lb/>found along the substrates normal. The expected result on the LC molecules is in this case a thershold splay defor-<lb/>mation toward the homeotropic orientation. The additional contribution of the pyroelectric field does not change <lb/>the thershold character of the LC response, which indicates that it also gives rise to a field orthogonal to the LC <lb/>initial average molecular orientation, inducing the same deformation mentioned above. <lb/>An independent estimate for the magnitude of the electric field responsible for LC director reorientation can <lb/>be obtained based on the observed characteristic time. The rise time for LC reorientation under the action of an <lb/>external electric field (when the field is well above threshold) is given by 18 : <lb/>τ <lb/>γ <lb/>ε ε <lb/>= <lb/>E <lb/>(5) <lb/>E <lb/>a <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>where γ is the LC rotational viscosity (γ the order of 0.1 Pa s for E7) and ε a is the LC dielectric anisotropy. A char-<lb/>acteristic time on a scale of 100 ms, as those reported in Figs 4 and 5, gives: <lb/>γ <lb/>ε ε τ <lb/>= <lb/>≈ <lb/>E <lb/>V m <lb/>10 / <lb/>(6) <lb/>a E <lb/>0 <lb/>6 <lb/>in agreement with the values calculated above for the fields that come into play. <lb/>A final remark is required about the response times. In both the analyzed configurations the observed on and <lb/>off times are smaller by at least one order of magnitude with respect to those expected for director reorientation <lb/>in a 50 µm conventional LC cell 18 . The fast dynamics could indicate that the LC reorientation involves only a thin <lb/></body>

			<body>layer of the whole sample, however the reasons for such an event cannot be immediately ascribed to any particu-<lb/>lar characteristic of the analyzed system. Further investigations are in progress for clarifying this experimental <lb/>observation. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>All optical control of the LC orientation in microfluidic channels engraved in iron-doped lithium niobate crystals <lb/>has been demonstrated. Microchannels have been obtained by a novel approach based on femtosecond pulse <lb/>laser micromachining realized in controlled atmosphere in order to reduce the surface roughness inside the <lb/>microfluidic channel. The effect has been analyzed in details and several peculiar features have been highlighted. <lb/>The first evidence of the effect of the secondary pyroelectric field induced in LiNbO 3 because of laser heating, on <lb/>LC reorientation has been reported. Specifically, LC director reorientation has been demonstrated to be due to a <lb/>combination of photovoltaic and pyroelectric fields, which give rise to a total space charge field whose effect on <lb/>LC molecular orientation and pump intensity dependence can be controlled by changing the directly irradiated <lb/>surface. This behavior appears to be interesting for optofluidic applications, where the development of active or <lb/>passive optical devices based on a proper material is currently the subject of wide investigation. <lb/>Due to the peculiarity of the optically induced space charge fields, the LC molecular reorientation develops <lb/>following a dynamic which is faster than the one characterizing the LC response in conventional cells. <lb/></body>
