			<front>Summary <lb/>Seminal fluid contains some of the fastest evolving proteins currently known. These seminal <lb/>fluid proteins (Sfps) play crucial roles in reproduction, such as supporting sperm function, <lb/>and -particularly in insects -modifying female physiology and behaviour. Identification of <lb/>Sfps in small animals is challenging, and often relies on samples taken from the female <lb/>reproductive tract after mating. A key pitfall of this method is that it might miss Sfps that are <lb/>of low abundance due to dilution in the female-derived sample or rapid processing in <lb/>females. Here we present a new and complimentary method, which provides added <lb/>sensitivity to Sfp identification. We applied label-free quantitative proteomics to Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster male reproductive tissue -where Sfps are unprocessed, and highly abundant <lb/>-and quantified Sfps before and immediately after mating, to infer those transferred during <lb/>copulation. We also analysed female reproductive tracts immediately before and after <lb/>copulation to confirm the presence and abundance of known and candidate Sfps, where <lb/>possible. Results were cross-referenced with transcriptomic and sequence databases to <lb/>improve confidence in Sfp detection. Our data was consistent with 124 previously reported <lb/>Sfps. We found 8 high-confidence novel candidate Sfps, which were both depleted in mated <lb/>versus unmated males and identified within the reproductive tract of mated but not virgin <lb/>females. We also identified 31 more candidates that are likely Sfps based on their <lb/>abundance, known expression and predicted characteristics, and revealed that four proteins <lb/>previously identified as Sfps are at best minor contributors to the ejaculate. The estimated <lb/>copy numbers for our candidate Sfps were lower than for previously identified Sfps, <lb/>supporting the idea that our technique provides a deeper analysis of the Sfp proteome than <lb/>previous studies. Our results demonstrate a novel, high-sensitivity approach to the analysis <lb/>of seminal fluid proteomes, whose application will further our understanding of reproductive <lb/>biology. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Seminal fluid, the non-sperm component of the ejaculate, is a highly complex matrix of bio-<lb/>molecules including peptides and proteins [1,2]. Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are typically <lb/>produced in specialized secretory glands in males (such as the accessory glands in insects, <lb/>and the prostate, seminal vesicles, bulbourethral glands and ampullary glands in mammals), <lb/>and are transferred to females during copulation. Sfps can play roles in sperm capacitation, <lb/>storage, competition and fertilization, and modulate female post-mating behaviour and <lb/>physiology [2-8]. In humans, evidence is accumulating that Sfps contribute to sperm <lb/>fertilization success, and Sfps have been suggested as important biomarkers of male <lb/>infertility [9]. Given the decline in male fertility over the last few decades [10], and increasing <lb/>age-related male infertility due to later parenthood in developed countries [11], there is an <lb/>urgent need for an improved molecular understanding of male reproduction. Proteomics will <lb/>play an important part in driving forward these advances in the field of human male <lb/>fertilization biology [12]. <lb/>In polyandrous species (in which females mate with multiple males) Sfps can influence <lb/>sperm competition, whereby the ejaculates of different males overlap in the female <lb/>reproductive tract, and the sperm of different males compete for fertilization [3]. Sfps evolve <lb/>rapidly, and are thought to be under sexual selection as a result of both sperm competition <lb/>and co-evolutionary conflicts between males and females [5,13-15]. Understanding which <lb/>Sfps contribute to male sperm competition outcomes is especially important in polyandrous <lb/>insect pests, because the success of key biocontrol methods, such as the Sterile Insect <lb/>Technique, rely on release of the males with competitively successful ejaculates [16]. <lb/>Moreover, studies in mammalian models show that seminal plasma can even influence the <lb/>health of offspring [2,17]. Given their important effects for male and female reproductive <lb/>success and offspring health, considerable recent research effort has focussed on proteomic <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>analyses of Sfps, for a diverse range of taxa. However, identification of the complete set of <lb/>proteins that are transferred to the female at mating remains a challenge. <lb/>Many mammals are amenable to artificial ejaculation techniques, where the ejaculate is <lb/>obtained by abdominal massage/squeezing [18,19], the usage of artificial vaginae [20] or <lb/>electroejaculation [21]. Although these methods allow for direct analyses of Sfps, they can <lb/>produce abnormal or inconsistent ejaculates, such as seen in mice [22]. Moreover, these <lb/>techniques are taxonomically restricted, and of limited use for most insect or bird species. <lb/>An alternative method for the identification of Sfps is whole-organism isotopic labelling <lb/>methods, whereby the females are metabolically labelled -by feeding a diet enriched in a <lb/>&quot;heavy&quot; isotope -then mated to unlabelled males. As a result, the female reproductive tract <lb/>proteome contains labelled female-derived proteins and unlabelled male Sfps that can be <lb/>distinguished and quantified. 15 N-labelled females have been used to characterize the Sfps <lb/>of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, house mice Mus domesticus, and dengue vector <lb/>mosquito Aedes aegypti [22-24]. While isotopic labeling methods have been instrumental for <lb/>allowing direct characterization of the seminal fluid proteome, they may not be able to detect <lb/>all male Sfps. Sfps might interact with each other during and after copulation -either in the <lb/>post ejaculation stage independent from the female, or once inside the female -and this <lb/>interaction might lead to protein degradation or cleavage, to release biologically active <lb/>products. For instance, the D. melanogaster Sfp, Acp26Aa, is rapidly cleaved within the <lb/>mated female&apos;s reproductive tract, whereupon two of its cleavage products induce ovulation <lb/>[25], and is detectable by ELISA for only 1 hour after mating [26]. If some Sfps are even <lb/>faster processed, they may be hard to detect within the mated female by proteomic <lb/>methods. In particular, Sfps involved in conflicts between the sexes could be rapidly <lb/>degraded by the females if the harm is minimized by impairing the Sfp&apos;s function [27]. <lb/>Another potential disadvantage of analyzing female reproductive tract samples after mating <lb/>is that the Sfps are diluted once they are inside the female, decreasing their relative <lb/>abundance. Previous work in D. melanogaster suggests that only about 15% of peptides are <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>from males in dissected female reproductive tracts (based on comparing the number of <lb/>peptides without vs. with 15 N-label) (G. Findlay, personal communication). Hence, it is likely <lb/>that methods aimed at identifying Sfps in mated female reproductive tract tissue samples <lb/>may miss Sfps that are low in abundance within the female. <lb/>Here we present a new quantitative proteomic method, based on the comparison of the <lb/>accessory gland proteomes of male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, before and after <lb/>mating. This method negates the above issues inherent to the analysis of female derived <lb/>samples, and allows for the indirect, but potentially powerful, inference of candidate Sfps. <lb/>Drosophila is a model species for ejaculate research and in particular the study of ejaculate-<lb/>mediated sexual selection and sexual conflict [5,28,29]. The functions of a number of D. <lb/>melanogaster Sfps have been investigated in detail, particularly in relation to their roles in <lb/>modulating behavioural and physiological processes in the female [7,30]. Using 15 N-labelling <lb/>of the female, Findlay et al., 2008 identified 157 Sfps transferred from the male during <lb/>copulation [23]. A small number of other male-derived proteins have been identified in the <lb/>reproductive tract of mated females in Drosophila melanogaster, bringing the total number to <lb/>163 proteins [31,32]. We refer to these proteins as &apos;known Sfps&apos;. In comparison 2,064 <lb/>proteins have been identified in the human seminal fluid. Although this number is an order of <lb/>magnitude more than the known Drosophila Sfps, it is still considerably lower than proteins <lb/>detected in other human bodily fluids, as for example the 10,000 proteins detected in blood <lb/>plasma [12]. Hence, it has been suggested that the large range of human Sfp abundance <lb/>could be hindering the detection of low abundance proteins, a problem that might be shared <lb/>among taxa including Drosophila. <lb/>D. melanogaster Sfps are stored in the male reproductive tract secretory tissues -accessory <lb/>glands, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory duct, ejaculatory bulb and testes [7], but there is no <lb/>comprehensive map of the particular storage locations for each Sfp. We describe a label-<lb/>free quantitative proteomics method based on the comparison of male accessory gland <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>proteomes for candidate Sfp identification in D. melanogaster. This method is particularly <lb/>aimed at capturing less abundant or rapidly degrading Sfps, that may have been missed in <lb/>previous studies. We based the study on the prediction that the abundance of Sfps in male <lb/>reproductive tract secretory tissues would significantly decrease at copulation. As expected, <lb/>we found that the vast majority of detected known Sfps were significantly less abundant <lb/>following mating. Many more proteins were also depleted following mating, indicating <lb/>possible contribution to the pool of Sfps. These were analysed for the presence of a signal <lb/>peptide for secretion, or to understand if the protein is exclusively expressed in accessory <lb/>gland tissues. The proteins that meet these assumptions are suggested as candidate Sfps. <lb/>No candidates passing both these filters were found in the reproductive tract of virgin <lb/>females, lending further support to the idea that these are male-originating. Finally, by <lb/>quantifying the proteome of the accessory glands and ejaculatory duct separately, we <lb/>demonstrate that a number of known Sfps are mainly or entirely stored in the ejaculatory-<lb/>duct rather than in the accessory glands. <lb/>Experimental Procedures <lb/>Stock and fly maintenance <lb/>We used a lab-adapted, outbred Dahomey wild-type stock for all our experimental males, <lb/>which has been maintained in large population cages with overlapping generations since <lb/>1970. All flies were maintained at 25 °C on a 12:12 L:D cycle and fed Lewis medium [33]. <lb/>Adult flies were maintained in 36 mL plastic vials containing Lewis medium supplemented <lb/>with ad libitum live yeast grains. Flies were reared using a standard larval density method by <lb/>placing approximately 200 eggs on 50 mL of food in 250 mL bottles [34]. Virgins were <lb/>collected on ice anaesthesia within 8h of eclosion and were assigned to their experimental <lb/>group. <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Experimental design <lb/>The general approach to find candidate Sfps was to identify proteins in the male <lb/>reproductive glands that significantly decreased in abundance after copulation (Fig. 1). We <lb/>then used transcriptomic data from Flybase and sequence data from UniParc to determine if <lb/>these proteins are exclusively expressed in the accessory glands, and if they are secreted <lb/>[35-37], as is expected for Sfp candidates. We also identified the proteins that significantly <lb/>increase in abundance in the female reproductive tracts after mating to validate the <lb/>candidate Sfps. Finally; we compared Sfp abundances in accessory glands and ejaculatory <lb/>ducts in order to determine where they are stored. <lb/>Male reproductive gland proteomes <lb/>To obtain the quantitative proteome of male reproductive glands before and after mating, we <lb/>used samples from two independent experiments. These experiments, detailed below, <lb/>provide a range of conditions for males, which might improve our power to identify proteins if <lb/>Sfp expression is context-dependent. In the first experiment, male age and mating history <lb/>were experimentally varied, and in the second experiment the adult social environment <lb/>(male group size) was experimentally varied (Fig. S1). Any effects of age, mating history or <lb/>social environment on Sfp abundance per se, are beyond the scope of the current study <lb/>(Sepil et al, in prep; Hopkins et al. in prep), but were controlled statistically to maximise <lb/>power (see Statistical Analyses below). <lb/>Male Dataset 1: males of varying age and mating history <lb/>Samples were collected from male flies of experimentally varied age and mating history, as <lb/>follows (Fig. S1a). Upon eclosion, Dahomey males were housed in groups of 12, either all <lb/>males (single sex group) or consisting of 3 virgin males and nine virgin Dahomey females <lb/>(mixed sex group). Males were allowed to age in their group vials for up to five weeks. Males <lb/>from three age classes were used: 1 week, 3 weeks and 5 weeks old. The single sex group <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>flies were transferred once, and the mixed sex group flies were transferred twice a week to <lb/>fresh vials using light CO 2 anaesthesia at each transfer. During the transfers, dead or <lb/>escaped females were replaced with similarly aged mated females. To minimize female co-<lb/>ageing effects in the 5 week old mixed sex groups, females were replaced at 3 weeks with <lb/>virgin 3-5 days old females, reared using the same procedures as above. To minimize <lb/>density effects on mating opportunity in the mixed sex group vials, two vials of the same <lb/>treatment were merged when a single male was left in a vial owing to previous mortality or <lb/>censoring. The males from the mixed sex groups were merged into single sex groups of 10-<lb/>12 males five days before sample collection, in order to allow them to replenish their Sfps. <lb/>The day before the sample collection, 210 virgin females were placed individually in vials. <lb/>On the day of sample collection, 35 males from each treatment (1 week old single sex <lb/>group, 3 weeks old single sex group, 5 weeks old single sex group, 1 week old mixed sex <lb/>group, 3 weeks old mixed sex group, 5 weeks old mixed sex group) were added to the <lb/>individually housed female vials for mating. The mated males were flash frozen in liquid <lb/>nitrogen 30 minutes after the start of the mating. These flies formed the &quot;newly mated&quot; male <lb/>groups (Fig. S1a). <lb/>Another 35 males from each treatment (i.e. 1 week old single sex group, 3 week old single <lb/>sex group, 5 week old single sex group, 1 week old mixed sex group, 3 week old mixed sex <lb/>group, 5 week old mixed sex group) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without being <lb/>exposed to females. These flies formed the &quot;unmated&quot; male groups. Hence each of the 6 <lb/>treatments had a &apos;newly mated&apos; and an &apos;unmated&apos; sample that were paired for further <lb/>analysis (Fig. S1a). We repeated this experiment four times to produce independent <lb/>biological replicates. We thawed flash frozen males and dissected their accessory glands <lb/>and ejaculatory duct on ice in PBS buffer. 19 reproductive glands from males of the same <lb/>treatment and replicate (out of a potential of 35) were pooled in 25µl PBS buffer on ice. <lb/>Hence, we had 6 paired newly mated male and unmated male samples from each replicate <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>and 24 paired newly mated male and unmated male samples in total (i.e. 48 samples <lb/>overall). <lb/>Male Dataset 2: varied social exposure <lb/>Upon eclosion, males were randomly allocated to one of three single sex group size <lb/>treatments: individually housed (treatment 1), housed in pairs (treatment 2), or housed in <lb/>groups of 8 (treatment 8). The males were aged in their treatment vials for four days (Fig. <lb/>S1b). The day before sample collection, 105 virgin females were placed individually in vials. <lb/>On the day of sample collection, 35 males from each treatment (1, 2 and 8) were added to <lb/>the female vials for mating. The mated males were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 25 minutes <lb/>after the start of the mating. These flies formed the &quot;newly mated&quot; male groups (Fig. S1b). <lb/>Another 35 males from each treatment (1, 2 and 8) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as <lb/>virgins without being exposed to females. These flies formed the &quot;unmated&quot; male groups. <lb/>Hence each treatment (1, 2, 8) had a &apos;newly mated&apos; and &apos;unmated&apos; sample that were paired <lb/>for further analysis. We repeated this experiment to produce five independent biological <lb/>replicates. Flash frozen males were dissected as outlined above. 20 reproductive glands <lb/>from males of the same treatment and replicate were pooled in 25µl PBS buffer on ice (Fig. <lb/>S1b). Hence, we had 3 paired newly mated male and virgin male samples from each <lb/>replicate and 15 paired newly mated male and virgin male samples in total. Overall we had <lb/>30 samples. <lb/>Sfps in the female reproductive tract <lb/>Upon eclosion Dahomey females and Dahomey males were aged in single sex groups of 12 <lb/>for 3 days. The day before sample collection 35 females were placed individually in vials. On <lb/>the day of sample collection, a single male was added to each female vial for mating. The <lb/>mated females were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 30 minutes after the start of the mating. <lb/>These flies formed the &quot;newly mated&quot; female group. Another 35 females were flash frozen in <lb/></body>

			<body>liquid nitrogen as virgins without being exposed to males. These flies formed the &quot;virgin&quot; <lb/>female group. The newly mated and virgin samples were paired for further analysis. We <lb/>repeated this experiment to obtain five independent, biological replicates. Flash frozen <lb/>females were thawed and their reproductive tracts (uterus, spermathecaes, parovarias and <lb/>the seminal receptacle, excluding the ovaries) were dissected on ice in PBS buffer. 20 <lb/>reproductive glands from females of the same treatment and replicate were pooled in 25µl <lb/>PBS buffer on ice. Hence, we had 5 paired newly mated female and virgin female samples <lb/>in total. Overall, we had 10 samples. <lb/>Male accessory glands and ejaculatory duct proteomes <lb/>Upon eclosion, males were aged in single sex groups of 12 for 3 days. 70 males were flash <lb/>frozen in liquid nitrogen as virgins. We repeated this procedure two more times to have three <lb/>independent, biological replicates. Flash frozen males were thawed and randomly allocated <lb/>to one of three dissection regimes: &quot;Accessory Gland&quot; (AG) regime flies only had their <lb/>accessory glands dissected out, &quot;Ejaculatory Duct (ED) regime flies only had their <lb/>ejaculatory duct dissected out and &quot;Both&quot; (BO) regime flies had both their accessory glands <lb/>and ejaculatory duct dissected out. All three biological replicates were split into AG, ED and <lb/>BO regime dissection groups. 20 reproductive tissues from males of the same dissection <lb/>group and replicate were pooled in 25µl PBS buffer on ice. Overall we had 9 samples. <lb/>Sample Preparation <lb/>All samples described above were stored at -80°C until sample preparation for proteomic <lb/>analysis. The samples were macerated with a clean pestle and washed with 25µl of Pierce <lb/>RIPA Buffer. Then they were digested using the standard gel-aided sample preparation <lb/>(GASP) protocol as described previously [38]. In brief, samples were reduced with 50 mM <lb/>DTT for 10 to 20 minutes. Protein lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 40% <lb/>acrylamide/Bis solution (37.5:1. National Diagnostics) and left at room temperature for 30 <lb/></body>

			<body>minutes to facilitate cysteine alkylation to propionamide. 5ul TEMED and 5 ul 10% APS were <lb/>added to trigger acrylamide polymerization. The resulting gel plug was shredded by <lb/>centrifugation through a Spin-X filter insert without membrane (CLS9301, Sigma/Corning). <lb/>Gel pieces were fixed in 40% ethanol /5% acetic acid before 2 successive rounds of buffer <lb/>exchange with 1.5 M Urea, 0.5 M Thiourea and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate which were <lb/>removed with acetonitrile. Immobilized proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) <lb/>overnight and peptides extracted with two rounds of acetonitrile replacements. Peptides <lb/>were first dried before desalting using Sola SPE columns (Thermo) and resuspended in 2% <lb/>ACN, 0.1 % FA buffer prior LC-MS/MS analysis. <lb/>LC-MS/MS <lb/>Peptide samples were analysed on a LC-MS/MS platform consisting of a Dionex Ultimate <lb/>3000 and a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (both Thermo). After peptide loading in 0.1% <lb/>TFA in 2% ACN onto a trap column (PepMAP C18, 300µm x5mm, 5 µm particle, Thermo), <lb/>peptides were separated on an easy spray column (PepMAP C18, 75 µm x 500mm, 2 µm <lb/>particle, Thermo) with a gradient 2% ACN to 35% ACN in 0.1% formic acid in 5% DMSO. <lb/>MS spectra were acquired in profile mode with a resolution of 70,000 with an ion target of <lb/>3x10 6 . The instrument was set to pick the 15 most intense features for subsequent MS/MS <lb/>analysis at a resolution of 17,500 and a maximum acquisition time of 128ms and an AGC <lb/>target of 1x10 5 after an isolation with 1.6 Th and a dynamic exclusion of 27 seconds. <lb/>Processing of MS Data <lb/>RAW files were imported into Progenesis QIP using default settings. MS/MS spectra were <lb/>converted into MGF files using the 200 most intense peaks without deconvolution before <lb/>database search in Mascot 2.5.1 using a Drosophila melanogaster database retrieved from <lb/></body>

			<body>Uniprot. We used 10 ppm for precursor mass accuracy and 0.05 Da for fragment accuracy in <lb/>Mascot, allowing variable Oxidation (M), Deamidation (N, Q) and Propionamide (K) as <lb/>variable modifications and 2 missed cleavage sites. Propionamide modification of Cysteines <lb/>was set as a fixed modification. We applied 1% FDR at peptide level and an additional <lb/>Mascot ion score cutoff of 20 before importing search results into Progenesis, where protein <lb/>quantification was calculated using the Top3 method. Quantitative protein data was further <lb/>normalized/processed as described below. <lb/>In silico protein annotation <lb/>We used SignalP and UniProt to predict whether a protein was likely to be secreted, by <lb/>checking for the presence of a signal peptide [35,36]. We used FlyAtlas to check for <lb/>exclusive expression in the accessory glands [37]. UniProt was also used to deduce protein <lb/>function. Lastly the Database for Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used <lb/>for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis [39,40]. The resulting p-values were corrected <lb/>for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>All analyses were conducted using R v. 3.4.0 (R Team, 2012). Each dataset (Male Dataset <lb/>1, Male Dataset 2, female reproductive tract proteome, and male accessory glands and <lb/>ejaculatory duct proteome) was analysed separately. Only proteins identified with at least <lb/>two unique peptides were included in the final dataset. Quantitative data generated by <lb/>Progenesis was normalised by log transforming the intensities [log 2 (x + 1)]. We followed the <lb/>method of Keilhauer et al. (2015) to determine a &apos;background proteome&apos; for median centring <lb/>purposes [42]. Briefly, we calculated the standard deviation of the intensity profile for each <lb/>identified protein, ranked the proteins according to the standard deviation of their profile, and <lb/>selected the bottom 90% of the data. This &apos;background proteome&apos; was used to median <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>centre the distribution of each sample. For the female reproductive tract dataset, quantified <lb/>proteins were confirmed with spectral counts for each condition, as some proteins are <lb/>expected to be present only in a subset of samples. We removed the proteins that had fewer <lb/>than three spectral counts in total (among the five replicates in mated or virgin samples) <lb/>from those samples. <lb/>Paired T-tests were performed to compare protein intensities between paired male samples <lb/>(unmated and newly mated male samples of the same treatment and replicate) and paired <lb/>female samples (virgin and newly mated female samples of the same replicate). The <lb/>resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. <lb/>The fold change between the means of the two groups and the negative log 10 of fdr-<lb/>corrected p-values were plotted against each other to create volcano plots. The <lb/>quantification data was also used to calculate the abundance of each protein in Male <lb/>Dataset 1 and Male Dataset 2 separately. Then the known Sfps and the candidate Sfps <lb/>were ranked in abundance to compare the estimated copy numbers of candidate Sfps <lb/>against known Sfps in these samples. The significance of the abundance differences <lb/>between known Sfps and candidate Sfps was calculated using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum <lb/>tests. <lb/>For the male accessory glands and ejaculatory duct proteome dataset we ran linear mixed <lb/>effect models on the subset of known seminal proteins and the high-confidence candidate <lb/>Sfps identified in this study to test whether the proteins are significantly more abundant in <lb/>different tissues. We used the nlme package in R. For each protein, the initial model <lb/>included the dissection regime (AG, DU or BO) as a fixed factor and the replicate number as <lb/>a random factor. Again, the resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using <lb/>Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Male reproductive glands proteome <lb/>Two datasets of pooled male reproductive tracts were analysed independently. Candidate <lb/>Sfps were then identified by applying a set of criteria across the results of both dataset <lb/>analyses. <lb/>Male Dataset 1 <lb/>From the 48 samples where 19 male reproductive tracts were pooled, we found a total of <lb/>1811 proteins, 1333 of which were identified by at least two unique peptides. We detected <lb/>109 (out of a total of 163) known Sfps, of which 100 were significantly more abundant in <lb/>unmated samples (p ≤ 0.02; 0.3 &lt; Fold change [unmated -mated] &lt; 3.232; Fig. 2a; Fig. 3a). <lb/>A further 159 proteins were found to be significantly more abundant in unmated samples (p <lb/>≤ 0.048; 0.106 &lt; Fold change [unmated -mated] &lt; 2.842; Fig. 3b). Below we apply a set of <lb/>criteria to these proteins in order to derive our new candidate Sfp proteins. <lb/>Male Dataset 2 <lb/>From the 30 samples where 20 male reproductive tracts were pooled, we found a total of <lb/>2025 proteins, of which 1279 were identified by at least two unique peptides. We detected <lb/>108 known Sfps and of these 90 were significantly more abundant in unmated samples (p ≤ <lb/>0.036; 0.29 &lt; Fold change [unmated -mated] &lt; 1.982; Fig. 2b; Fig. 3a). Male Dataset 1 and <lb/>Male Dataset 2 have 83 known Sfps in common that are significantly more abundant (p ≤ <lb/>0.035) in the unmated treatments (Fig. 3a). Another 92 proteins were found to be <lb/>significantly more abundant in unmated samples (p ≤ 0.049; 0.277 &lt; Fold change [unmated <lb/>-mated] &lt; 2.161). 38 of these were shared with Male Dataset 1 (Fig. 3b). <lb/></body>

			<body>Candidate Sfps from male datasets <lb/>For the proteins that were found to be significantly more abundant in unmated samples in <lb/>either male dataset (excluding the known Sfps) we checked whether they met a set of <lb/>criteria to determine candidate Sfps. These criteria were: <lb/>(1) Significantly higher abundance (p ≤ 0.05) in unmated male samples (Male <lb/>Dataset 1) and, if present, higher abundance in unmated male samples (Male <lb/>Dataset 2) <lb/>(2) Significantly higher abundance (p ≤ 0.05) in unmated male samples (Male <lb/>Dataset 2) and, if present, higher abundance in unmated male samples (Male <lb/>Dataset 1) <lb/>(3) Presence of a signal peptide <lb/>(4) Exclusive expression in accessory glands. <lb/>We considered proteins that met at least three of the criteria as candidate Sfps. 39 proteins <lb/>met at least three criteria and are suggested as novel Sfp candidates (Fig. 2). Functional <lb/>classifications among these 39 proteins included proteases, protease inhibitors, function in <lb/>cell adhesion, chitin binding, lipid metabolism and DNA interactions. (Table 1; Table S1). <lb/>These classes are highly similar to the functional classes of known Sfps [23]. DAVID <lb/>analysis for enriched GO terms within the 39 candidate Sfps (using the complete list of <lb/>known Sfps plus the candidate Sfps as background) revealed enrichment for presence in <lb/>extracellular region (p = 0.034) and hydrolases (p = 0.036). Moreover, candidate Sfps were <lb/>significantly less abundant than known Sfps in both Male Dataset 1 (χ 2 <lb/>1 = 31.993; p = <lb/>1.547e -8 ) and Male Dataset 2 (χ 2 <lb/>1 = 26.042; p = 3.34e -7 ; Fig. 4). <lb/>We similarly checked for functional enrichment in the remaining up and down regulated <lb/>proteins in both male datasets and largely detected no significant changes. The only <lb/>exception was in an analysis of the proteins that were significantly more abundant (p ≤ <lb/>0.049) in newly mated males in Male Dataset 2 (Fig. 2b -proteins on the left arm of the <lb/>volcano plot) against all the proteins detected in Male Dataset 2, which revealed enrichment <lb/></body>

			<body>for ribonucleoprotein activity (p = 3.4e -4 ), translation (p = 0.006), ribosomal proteins (p = <lb/>0.008), structural constituents of ribosomes (p = 0.016) and ribosomes (p = 0.042). <lb/>Female reproductive tract proteome <lb/>From the 10 samples where 20 female reproductive tracts were pooled, we found a total of <lb/>2150 proteins, of which 1482 were identified by at least two unique peptides. We detected <lb/>101 known Sfps, and of these 96 were significantly more abundant in mated samples (1.25e -<lb/>5 &lt; p &lt; 0.039; 0.3 &lt; Fold change [mated -virgin] &lt; 3.232; Fig. 5). While the known Sfps <lb/>were consistently in higher abundance in mated flies, the data appeared to indicate the <lb/>presence of some Sfps in virgin females at low abundance. The genes for some of these <lb/>known Sfps are expressed in virgin females, which could explain their presence, but others <lb/>are thought to be exclusively expressed in the male accessory glands [37]. Of the 60 known <lb/>Sfps previously identified as exclusively expressed in males, virgin samples had more than <lb/>two spectral counts for only one protein (5 spectral counts), whereas mated samples had <lb/>more than two spectral counts for 59 proteins (range of 7 to 1017 spectral counts). The other <lb/>41 known Sfps had expression profiles in virgin females or did not have an expression <lb/>profile at all [37]. Of these 41 Sfps, virgin samples had more than two spectral counts for 17 <lb/>proteins (range of 4 to 94 spectral counts), whereas mated samples had for all proteins <lb/>(range of 3 to 414 spectral counts). Another 204 proteins were found to be significantly more <lb/>abundant (p ≤ 0.049) in mated female samples. 89 of these proteins are known sperm <lb/>proteins and are found in the Drosophila melanogaster sperm proteome II [43]. No <lb/>enrichment was detected when the rest of the proteins significantly higher in mated females <lb/>(Fig. 5 -black coloured proteins on the upper right arm of the volcano plot) were checked <lb/>against all the female proteins. However, analysis of the proteins that are significantly more <lb/>abundant (p ≤ 0.049) in virgin females (Fig. 5 -proteins on the upper left arm of the volcano <lb/>plot) revealed enrichment for immunoglobulin-like domains (Table S2). <lb/></body>

			<body>The 39 candidate Sfps identified from the male datasets using 4 criteria were checked for <lb/>two further criteria: (5) Significantly higher abundance in mated female samples; and (6) <lb/>Presence in mated and absence in virgin female samples on the basis of spectral counts. 8 <lb/>of the 39 novel candidate Sfps also met these additional criteria and are therefore classified <lb/>as high-confidence candidate Sfps (Fig. 5, Table 2). Two of these high-confidence candidate <lb/>Sfps have unknown functions (CG3640, BG642163), two are protease inhibitors (CG43145, <lb/>Spn28Db), one is a protease (CG3097), and one function in cell redox homeostasis <lb/>(CG31413), lipid metabolism (CG31684) and hormone metabolism (CG9519). <lb/>Confirmed known Sfps from male and female datasets <lb/>The known Sfps that were found to be significantly more abundant (p ≤ 0.05) in unmated <lb/>samples in either male dataset or that were found to be significantly more abundant (p ≤ <lb/>0.05) in mated samples in the female dataset were classified as confirmed known Sfps. In <lb/>total, 124 out of the 163 known Sfps were confirmed in our study (Table S3). Three known <lb/>Sfps (CG5267, Sfp79B and Sfp84E) were similarly abundant and one known Sfp (CG15116) <lb/>was less abundant in unmated samples in either male dataset, hence these are at best <lb/>minor contributors to the ejaculate. <lb/>Male accessory glands and ejaculatory duct proteome <lb/>From the 9 samples where 20 reproductive tissues were pooled, we found 1783 proteins, of <lb/>which 1346 were identified by at least two unique peptides. Of the 117 known Sfps and high-<lb/>confidence candidate Sfps detected, 109 varied in abundances between tissue samples. For <lb/>14 of these, protein abundances were significantly higher (p ≤ 0.012) in the ejaculatory duct <lb/>than in the accessory gland (DU compared to AG). The abundances of these 14 proteins <lb/>were similar between samples containing both the ejaculatory duct and accessory gland <lb/>(BO) and DU samples, except for CG17242 where the protein was significantly more <lb/>abundant (p ≤ 0.034) in the DU sample. Among these 14 proteins, 11 were also significantly <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>more abundant (p ≤ 0.047) in the samples containing both the ejaculatory duct and <lb/>accessory gland (BO) compared to the AG samples. Hence they are likely primarily or wholly <lb/>ejaculatory duct-derived (Fig. 6). The other three proteins, Est-6, NLaz and Obp56g, were <lb/>considered candidate ejaculatory-duct derived Sfps (Fig. S2). While six of the 11 proteins <lb/>were known ejaculatory duct proteins (Saudan et al., 2002; Takemori &amp; Yamamoto, 2009), <lb/>the other five Sfps, CG17242, CG18067, CG31704, CG5402, Met75Ca, had not previously <lb/>been linked to this tissue (Table S4). DAVID analysis of the 11 proteins against all the <lb/>known Sfps did not identify any significant classes or functions for the putative ejaculatory-<lb/>duct stored Sfps. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We utilized label-free quantitative proteomics to identify candidate Sfps, by comparing the <lb/>Sfp-producing tissues of males, and the reproductive tracts of females, before and after <lb/>mating. Using this approach, our data showed consistency with 124 previously known Sfps, <lb/>detected 8 additional proteins that are highly likely to be Sfps, and identified a further 31 <lb/>proteins as candidate Sfps. Lastly, we revealed that 11 Sfps are mainly stored in the <lb/>ejaculatory duct, 5 of which were not previously linked with that tissue. Taken together, <lb/>these results demonstrate how label-free quantitative proteomics methods, and our tissue-<lb/>comparison approach, could be used to complement labelling techniques to expand Sfp <lb/>characterization and localization. <lb/>The approach we used here relies largely on just two principles. Sfps should decrease in <lb/>quantity following mating in male secretory organs (Criteria 1 and 2), and Sfps should <lb/>appear or increase in quantity following mating in female reproductive tracts (Criteria 5 and <lb/>6). While previous studies have checked whether proteins appear in female reproductive <lb/>tract following mating as a way to identify Sfps without the usage of labelling techniques [46], <lb/>a label-free quantitative proteomics approach utilizing male accessory gland proteomes <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>before and after mating has been lacking in the field. This is an important omission for two <lb/>reasons. Approaches that are solely based on identifying proteins from the female <lb/>reproductive tract might miss male-derived proteins that get rapidly cleaved/degraded during <lb/>or soon after ejaculation in the male or female reproductive-tract. Likewise, approaches <lb/>utilizing females are likely to overlook Sfps that are in low abundance, as they will be further <lb/>diluted within the female reproductive tract. By comparing the reproductive tract proteome of <lb/>males, our method has the potential to overcome these issues, and provides a <lb/>complementary method to techniques that utilize females. <lb/>In this study we used Drosophila melanogaster, a species that has its Sfps well <lb/>characterized through 15 N-labeling [23]. Here, we identify a number of proteins significantly <lb/>decreasing in abundance following mating (from two independent male datasets). However, <lb/>we used additional criteria to utilize the wealth of knowledge that exist for flies to expand the <lb/>seminal fluid proteome. We checked whether these proteins had a signal peptide or were <lb/>exclusively expressed in the accessory glands, as these are common qualities of Sfps. We <lb/>considered proteins that met at least three out of the first four criteria to be considered a <lb/>candidate Sfp. Based on all this information, 39 candidate Sfps were identified. We <lb/>subsequently analysed female reproductive tracts immediately after copulation to verify the <lb/>presence of the candidate Sfps, where possible (Criteria 5 and 6). 8 of the 39 candidate Sfps <lb/>were detected in the females following mating. As the data from the female reproductive <lb/>tract confirmed the transfer of these 8 proteins we suggest them as high-confidence <lb/>candidate Sfps. The other 31 of the 39 candidate Sfps are of interest as they might <lb/>represent the set of proteins that avoid detection in females for the reasons set above. Our <lb/>criteria are relatively conservative, and should ensure that most of our candidates are <lb/>genuine Sfps. However, because these proteins were not found elevated in abundance in <lb/>the female reproductive tract after mating we cannot exclude the possibility that these <lb/>proteins deplete in the male during copulation for reasons other than being transferred to the <lb/>female, and are therefore not Sfps. Targeted approaches, analyses of increased sensitivity, <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>and measurements taken at earlier copulation time intervals should be used in the future to <lb/>confirm which of these candidates are true Sfps. <lb/>The gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the new candidate Sfps we identified <lb/>are more likely to be hydrolases and be present in the extracellular region. Hydrolases <lb/>function in the cleavage of chemical bonds and are further classified into several subclasses <lb/>(such as lipases, glycosylases, proteases), based upon the bonds that they cleave. A large <lb/>number of proteases, lipases and chitinases have already been identified in the seminal <lb/>fluid; hence our findings suggest that the functional classes of the candidates are broadly <lb/>similar to the functional classes of the known Sfps [23]. The high number of proteases and <lb/>protease inhibitors point towards a very delicately regulated protein system to support sperm <lb/>function and female postmating behaviour. Drosophila seminal fluid proteases are known to <lb/>regulate proteolytic and post-mating reproductive processes [47], hence these candidates <lb/>warrant further investigation. <lb/>Yet, there are no predicted functions for quarter of the candidate Sfps. Functional analysis of <lb/>specific candidates through loss of function or overexpression experiments would be <lb/>necessary to elucidate the role of these proteins. It is also currently unknown if any of these <lb/>proteins are cleaved or processed in the ejaculate or once inside the female, and further <lb/>investigations are necessary to test these possibilities. However, as expected, our analyses <lb/>did reveal that the candidate Sfps are significantly less abundant than the known Sfps. This <lb/>finding strengthens the possibility that the majority of the candidate Sfps were missed out in <lb/>previous studies utilizing mated females due to their low copy number in the samples, or <lb/>rapid processing upon ejaculation. <lb/>Previously, 11 proteins were identified as duct-specific in D. melanogaster [44,45,48]. <lb/>However, only seven of these are known Sfps so only these were considered in our study. <lb/>We verified six of these and found five new Sfps to be ejaculatory-duct specific. The one Sfp <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>that was not verified is Est-6, which was classified as a candidate ejaculatory duct-derived <lb/>protein in our study. This is because the abundance of Est-6 was similar between accessory <lb/>gland samples (AG) and combined accessory gland and ejaculatory duct samples (BO) <lb/>Investigating compositional changes in duct-specific and accessory gland-specific proteins, <lb/>in relation to male and female condition will provide insights as to whether structural <lb/>compartmentalization influences ejaculate composition. In Drosophila melanogaster, it has <lb/>already been shown that males can adaptively tailor the composition of proteins in the <lb/>ejaculate to exploit the effects of a previous male&apos;s ejaculate. However the mechanism by <lb/>which males could adjust the composition of their ejaculate is currently unclear [49]. In Pieris <lb/>rapae butterflies, the distinct protein mixtures found in the spermatophore envelope and the <lb/>inner matrix are stored in separate regions of the male reproductive tract and are transferred <lb/>to the female sequentially [50]. This partitioning is likely to have important implications for <lb/>how males strategically tailor their ejaculates, or conversely how pathology in specific Sfp-<lb/>producing compartments impacts ejaculate composition and quality. For example, the Sfps <lb/>in the human seminal plasma are stored in multiple compartments, each with specific <lb/>functions (e.g. prostate, ampullary glands, seminal vesicles, bulbourethral glands, and <lb/>epididymis), thus infections in specific glands will have distinct signatures in the seminal <lb/>plasma [51]. Improving our knowledge of the proteomic contribution of each accessory gland <lb/>is crucial if we are to understand the mechanisms that generate variation in ejaculate <lb/>composition. <lb/>Gene ontology analysis of proteins that are significantly more abundant in newly mated <lb/>males (the opposite to Sfps) identified enrichment for translation and ribosome related <lb/>activity in one of the male datasets. This result is expected considering that males of D. <lb/>melanogaster transfer about one third of their accessory gland contents to the female during <lb/>each mating, and mating induces the rapid transcription and translation of Sfp genes [26,52]. <lb/>However, enrichment for translation in newly mated males was only detected in Male <lb/>Dataset 2, where males were uniformly young (four days old) but not Male Dataset 1 where <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>males were up to five weeks old. Koppik &amp; Fricke (2017) have recently reported a decrease <lb/>in male Sfp gene expression with advancing age [53], which could explain why no <lb/>enrichment was observed in Dataset 1, which included older males. Similarly, semen volume <lb/>is known to decrease with age in humans, while sperm concentration does not [11]. This <lb/>suggests that at least part of human male reproductive ageing is non-sperm components of <lb/>the ejaculate. Investigating the effects of ageing on the male accessory gland proteome is <lb/>the subject of ongoing work. Moreover, the proteins significantly more abundant in virgin <lb/>females were enriched for immunoglobulin-like domains that are involved in cell-cell <lb/>recognition, cell-surface receptors and muscle structure [54]. The suppression of proteins <lb/>related to these functions might be due to the conformational changes in the female <lb/>reproductive tract following mating and warrants further investigation. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>In order to understand the role of Sfps in reproduction, it is essential to characterize the full <lb/>suite of seminal fluid products. In this study, we have described a label-free quantitative <lb/>proteomics method for Sfp identification that can potentially identify proteins that avoid <lb/>detection in labelling techniques utilizing females, such as those that are quickly degraded <lb/>and/or low abundance. We propose both techniques to be used in conjunction for reliable <lb/>Sfp identification. Our data show that the method is also useful for deciphering the <lb/>contribution of different male reproductive tissues to the seminal fluid proteome. <lb/></body>
