			<front>BRIEF COMMUNICATION <lb/>OPEN <lb/>Digital biomarkers of cognitive function <lb/>Paul Dagum 1 <lb/>To identify digital biomarkers associated with cognitive function, we analyzed human-computer interaction from 7 days of <lb/>smartphone use in 27 subjects (ages 18-34) who received a gold standard neuropsychological assessment. For several <lb/>neuropsychological constructs (working memory, memory, executive function, language, and intelligence), we found a family of <lb/>digital biomarkers that predicted test scores with high correlations (p &lt; 10 −4 ). These preliminary results suggest that passive <lb/>measures from smartphone use could be a continuous ecological surrogate for laboratory-based neuropsychological assessment. <lb/>npj Digital Medicine (2018) 1:10 ; doi:10.1038/s41746-018-0018-4 <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>By comparison to the functional metrics available in other <lb/>disciplines, conventional measures of neuropsychiatric disorders <lb/>have several challenges. First, they are obtrusive, requiring a <lb/>subject to break from their normal routine, dedicating time and <lb/>often travel. Second, they are not ecological and require subjects <lb/>to perform a task outside of the context of everyday behavior. <lb/>Third, they are episodic and provide sparse snapshots of a patient <lb/>only at the time of the assessment. Lastly, they are poorly scalable, <lb/>taxing limited resources including space and trained staff. <lb/>In seeking objective and ecological measures of cognition, we <lb/>attempted to develop a method to measure memory and <lb/>executive function not in the laboratory but in the moment, <lb/>day-to-day. We used human-computer interaction on smart-<lb/>phones to identify digital biomarkers that were correlated with <lb/>neuropsychological performance. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>In 2014, 27 participants (ages 27.1 ± 4.4 years, education <lb/>14.1 ± 2.3 years, M:F 8:19) volunteered for neuropsychological <lb/>assessment and a test of the smartphone app. Smartphone <lb/>human-computer interaction data from the 7 days following <lb/>the neuropsychological assessment showed a range of correla-<lb/>tions with the cognitive scores. Table 1 shows the correlation <lb/>between each neurocognitive test and the cross-validated <lb/>predictions of the supervised kernel PCA constructed from <lb/>the biomarkers for that test. Figure 1 shows each participant <lb/>test score and the digital biomarker prediction for (a) digits <lb/>backward, (b) symbol digit modality, (c) animal fluency, <lb/>(d) Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd Edition (WMS-III) logical <lb/>memory (delayed free recall), (e) brief visuospatial memory test <lb/>(delayed free recall), and (f) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-<lb/>4th Edition (WAIS-IV) block design. Construct validity of the <lb/>predictions was determined using pattern matching that <lb/>computed a correlation of 0.87 with p &lt; 10 −59 between the <lb/>covariance matrix of the predictions and the covariance matrix <lb/>of the tests. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>DISCUSSION <lb/>We have shown that we can generate digital biomarkers <lb/>correlated with gold-standard neurocognitive tests using passively <lb/>acquired data during daily use of a smartphone. Using supervised <lb/>kernel PCA we can generate cross-validated predictions of the test <lb/>scores with precision comparable to the gold-standard test-retest <lb/>reliabilities. 1,2 These digital biomarkers offer several advantages to <lb/>conventional assessments. First, they are unobtrusive, placing no <lb/>burden on the subject beyond the normal use of a smartphone. <lb/>Second, they are ecological since the smartphone data is captured <lb/>in a natural environment. Third, they provide dense daily <lb/>assessments with potential insight into hour to hour or day to <lb/>day variations in cognitive function. Lastly, they could scale <lb/>globally with three billion smartphone users today, projected to <lb/>6 billion by 2020 (https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-<lb/>smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-<lb/>subscriptions/). <lb/>An obvious limitation of this pilot study is the small size (n = 27) <lb/>relative to the large number of potential biomarkers (n = 1035). To <lb/>counter the risk of over-fitting these results, predictions were <lb/>made using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), stringent <lb/>confidence level (p &lt; 10 −4 ) and a simple linear kernel that was <lb/>regularized. Nevertheless, these results should be considered <lb/>preliminary until replicated in an independent sample. A further <lb/>limitation is that the neuropsychological assessment occurred at <lb/>one time point and the digital features were collected ecologically <lb/>over the first 7 days following the assessment. For clinical <lb/>assessments, one might argue that the real-world, continuous <lb/>assessment would yield critical information relevant to function. <lb/>Fig. 1 A blue square represents a participant test Z-score normed to the 27 participant scores and a red circle represents the digital biomarker <lb/>prediction Z-score normed to the 27 predictions. Test scores and predictions shown are a digits backward, b symbol digit modality, c animal <lb/>fluency, d Wechsler memory Scale-3rd Edition (WMS-III) logical memory (delayed free recall), e brief visuospatial memory test (delayed free <lb/>recall), and f Wechsler adult intelligence scale-4th Edition (WAIS-IV) block design <lb/></body>

			<body>Indeed, we postulate that the daily variability in the digital <lb/>biomarkers will provide rich temporal insight into state-dependent <lb/>changes in cognition and emotional health that may arise from <lb/>disease and environmental effects. The selection of 7 days <lb/>provided ecological data from which to select the peak value of <lb/>each biomarker, which consistently led to the best predictions, <lb/>suggesting that in the laboratory a participant performs at their <lb/>best while in the real-world the participant&apos;s function will deviate <lb/>from peak depending on disease and environmental effects. <lb/>Several large clinical studies will confirm our hypothesis and <lb/>further establish the clinical utility of our approach. <lb/>METHOD <lb/>All participants, recruited via social media, signed an informed consent <lb/>form. Inclusion criteria required participants to be functional English <lb/>speaking and active users of a smartphone. The protocol involved 3 h of <lb/>psychometric assessment, installation of an app on their smartphone. The <lb/>test battery is shown in the first column of Table 1. A single <lb/>psychometrician performed all testing in a standard assessment clinic. <lb/>The app on the phone ran passively in the background and captured <lb/>tactile user activity that included swipes, taps, and keystroke events, <lb/>collectively termed human-computer interactions (HCI). <lb/>From the HCI events we identified 45 event patterns. Each pattern <lb/>represents a task that is repeated up to several hundred times per day by a <lb/>user during normal use of their phone. Most patterns consisted of two <lb/>successive events, such as tapping on the space-bar followed by the first <lb/>character of a word, or tapping delete followed by another delete tap. <lb/>Some patterns were collected in a specific context of use. For example, <lb/>tapping on a character followed by another character could be collected at <lb/>the beginning of a word, middle of a word, or end of a word. Each pattern <lb/>generated a time-series composed of the time interval between patterns. <lb/>The time-series were segmented into daily time-series. To each daily time-<lb/>series we applied 23 mathematical transforms to produce 1035 distinct <lb/>daily measurements that we term digital biomarkers. <lb/>For each participant we selected the first 7 days of data following their <lb/>test date. A biomarker was considered a candidate for a neurocognitive <lb/>test if over the 7 day window the 7 correlations between sorted biomarker <lb/>values and the test scores were stable (meaning of the same sign). The <lb/>two-dimensional design matrix for the supervised kernel PCA was <lb/>constructed by selecting the peak value of each candidate biomarker <lb/>over the 7 days. For each test, we constructed a linear reproducing Hilbert <lb/>space kernel from the biomarkers and used a supervised kernel principal <lb/>component analysis 3 with LOOCV as follows. To predict the 1st participant <lb/>test result the model fitting algorithm was run on the remaining <lb/>participants without access to the 1st participant&apos;s data, and so forth <lb/>iterating 27 times to generate the 27 predictions. <lb/></body>
