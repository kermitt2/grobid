			<body>Particle accelerators lie at the heart of many areas of <lb/>science, technology, and medicine either through direct <lb/>application of the particle beams or by driving radiation <lb/>sources such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers <lb/>(FELs). With conventional radio-frequency (RF) techno-<lb/>logy the electric field used to accelerate particles is <lb/>typically less than 100 MV m −1 , which is a significant <lb/>factor determining the size and cost of the machine. In <lb/>distinct contrast, plasma accelerators can generate gradients <lb/>of order 100 GV m −1 , which shrinks the length of the <lb/>acceleration stage by orders of magnitude. <lb/>In a plasma accelerator the acceleration field is generated <lb/>within a trailing plasma wakefield excited by displacement <lb/>of the plasma electrons by a driving laser pulse [1-4] or <lb/>particle bunch [5,6]. Laser-driven plasma accelerators have <lb/>made impressive progress [7] in recent years. They can now <lb/>generate electron beams with energies comparable to those <lb/>used in synchrotrons and FELs (a few GeV), but in <lb/>accelerator stages only a few centimetres long [8-10], <lb/>with bunch durations in the femtosecond range [11-13], <lb/>and with properties ideal for generating femtosecond <lb/>duration visible to x-ray pulses [14-20]. <lb/>In almost all recent work the plasma wakefield has been <lb/>driven by single laser pulses from high-power Ti:sapphire <lb/>chirped-pulse-amplification laser systems. Unfortunately, <lb/>these have very low wall-plug efficiency (&lt;0.1%) and <lb/>cannot readily operate at pulse repetition frequencies <lb/>much above f rep ¼ 10 Hz. At present, therefore, the driver <lb/>parameters severely restrict the number of potential appli-<lb/>cations of laser-plasma accelerators. <lb/>We recently reexamined [21] multipulse laser wakefield <lb/>acceleration (MP-LWFA) in which the wakefield is excited <lb/>by a train of low-energy laser pulses, rather than by a single, <lb/>high-energy pulse. If the pulses are spaced by the plasma <lb/>wavelength λ p0 ¼ 2πc=ω p0 , then the wakefields driven by <lb/>the pulses in the train add coherently, causing the plasma <lb/>wave amplitude to grow towards the back of the train. Here, <lb/>the plasma frequency is ω p0 ¼ 2π=T p0 ¼ ðn e0 e 2 =m e ϵ 0 Þ 1=2 , <lb/>where n e0 is the ambient electron density. We note that <lb/>Benedetti et al. [22] have studied an alternative scheme in <lb/>which the wakefield is driven by an incoherent combination <lb/>of laser pulses arranged longitudinally, or transversely, <lb/>within a single plasma period. <lb/>Using a train of low-energy laser pulses opens plasma <lb/>accelerators to novel laser technologies, such as fiber or <lb/>thin-disk lasers, which cannot directly deliver joule-level <lb/>short pulses, but which can provide lower-energy pulses <lb/>with f rep in the kilohertz range, whilst achieving wall-plug <lb/>efficiencies at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than <lb/>conventional solid-state lasers [23]. Our recent analysis <lb/>[21] showed that a MP-LWFA driven by a near-term laser <lb/>system of this type could drive wakefields with an accel-<lb/>erating field of 4.7 GV m −1 , with a dephasing-limited <lb/>energy gain of 0.75 GeV, and that with f rep ¼ 10 kHz <lb/>these could drive compact coherent and incoherent x-ray <lb/>sources with average brightnesses exceeding those available <lb/>from large scale, nonsuperconducting, RF accelerators. A <lb/>further advantage of MP-LWFA is that it provides a natural <lb/>architecture for &quot;energy recovery&quot;: the use of one or more <lb/>trailing laser pulses to remove (and potentially recycle) <lb/>energy remaining in the wakefield after particle acceleration. <lb/>Energy recovery is likely to be an important capability in <lb/>future plasma accelerators operating at high average powers. <lb/>In this Letter we present the first demonstration of <lb/>wakefield excitation by a laser pulse structure that is long <lb/>compared to the plasma period, and for which there is <lb/></body>

			<body>sufficient control of the temporal profile to overcome <lb/>relativistic saturation. We also take an important first step <lb/>towards achieving energy recovery by showing that a <lb/>suitably delayed laser pulse can damp the plasma wave <lb/>driven by a leading pulse. We achieve this through <lb/>measurements of plasma waves by frequency domain <lb/>holography (FDH) and a new analysis method, temporally <lb/>encoded spectral shifting (TESS) [24]; we demonstrate that <lb/>these two analyses are in excellent agreement, and that our <lb/>results are well described by a linear response model of <lb/>wakefield excitation. <lb/>Since laser systems generating directly the pulse trains <lb/>required for MP-LWFA are still under development, this <lb/>first demonstration employed a Ti:sapphire laser-the <lb/>Gemini (Astra TA2) laser at the Rutherford Appleton <lb/>Laboratory-reconfigured to generate trains of laser pulses. <lb/>In its standard arrangement this laser delivers to target <lb/>approximately 600 mJ, 40 fs laser pulses with a center <lb/>wavelength λ 0 ¼ 800 nm at f rep ¼ 5 Hz. <lb/>Figure 1 shows schematically the experimental arrange-<lb/>ment employed (see Supplemental Material [25] for further <lb/>details of the experimental arrangement and analysis <lb/>methods). Single, temporally chirped pulses from the laser <lb/>system were converted into pulse trains by placing a <lb/>Michelson interferometer between the final laser amplifier <lb/>and its vacuum compressor, as discussed in Refs. [26,27]. <lb/>The Michelson acted as a spectral filter with a spectral <lb/>intensity transmission of the form TðωÞ ¼ cos 2 ðωΔx=2cÞ, <lb/>where Δx is the path difference between the Michelson <lb/>arms. With the compressor set for partial compression, <lb/>the modulated spectrum transmitted by the Michelson was <lb/>partially compressed to a train of pulses, with a temporal <lb/>spacing that could be controlled by adjusting the Michelson <lb/>and compressor. With the compressor set to give full <lb/>compression of an unmodulated input pulse, the output <lb/>of the combination comprised a pair of short (approxi-<lb/>mately 50 fs) pulses temporally separated by δτ ¼ Δx=c. <lb/>The temporal intensity profiles of the pulse trains were <lb/>determined by combining a model of the laser compressor <lb/>and pulse train Michelson with measurements of the pulse <lb/>train spectrum and single-shot autocorrelation (SSA) [27]. <lb/>The pulse train was directed to an f ¼ 1 m off-axis <lb/>paraboloid, used at f=18, which focused the pulses through <lb/>a hydrogen gas cell; this was 3 mm long, with entrance and <lb/>exit pinholes of 250 μm diameter. The spot size (1=e 2 <lb/>radius of the transverse intensity profile) of the focused <lb/>pulse trains was measured to be w 0 ¼ ð35 AE 5Þ μm. <lb/>Plasma wakefields driven by the pulse train were probed <lb/>by frequency domain holography [28]. In this method a <lb/>frequency-chirped probe pulse copropagates with the <lb/>plasma wave and a reference pulse located ahead of the <lb/>plasma wave. These diagnostic pulses are then interfered <lb/>in a spectrograph to give a spectral interferogram, with <lb/>spatial information in the nondispersed direction. When the <lb/>chirped probe pulse interacts with a plasma wave, each of <lb/>its frequency components experiences a phase shift that <lb/>depends on the local wakefield amplitude; after a length l <lb/>of plasma this phase shift can be written as ϕ p ðζÞ ¼ <lb/>ðω 0 =cÞl½ηðζÞ − η 0 , where ω 0 is the angular frequency <lb/>of the probe pulse, ζ ¼ t − l=c, ηðζÞ is the refractive index <lb/>of the plasma, and η 0 is the refractive index experienced by <lb/>the reference pulse. The spectrum of the combined trans-<lb/>mitted probe and reference pulses comprises spectral <lb/>fringes of angular frequency separation Δω ¼ 2π=Δt, <lb/>where Δt is the temporal separation of the probe and <lb/>reference pulses, modulated by a spectral phase ΔψðωÞ <lb/>that depends on the wakefield (for an example, see <lb/>Supplemental Material [25]). Frequency domain holo-<lb/>graphy uses well-known Fourier techniques to extract <lb/>ΔψðωÞ from the interferogram, and hence the temporal <lb/>phase shift caused by the plasma wave [28]. <lb/>In this work we also used a TESS analysis [24] of the <lb/>same data, which is applicable when the plasma wave is <lb/>sinusoidal. In this approach a Fourier transform of the <lb/>interferogram yields a sideband at t ¼ Δt and a series of <lb/>satellites at t¼Δtþmψ ð2Þ ω p0 where m ¼ AE1; AE2; AE3; … <lb/>and ψ ð2Þ is the group delay dispersion (GDD) of the probe <lb/>and reference pulses.

			A pair of λ ¼ 400 nm diagnostic pulses, with an adjust-<lb/>able temporal separation Δt, were generated by passing a <lb/>separately compressed and frequency-doubled fraction of <lb/>the main laser pulse through a Michelson interferometer. <lb/>These pulses were chirped and stretched to a duration of <lb/>around 1.5 ps by sending them through a 160 mm long <lb/>block of BK7 glass. The diagnostic pulses were propagated <lb/>colinearly with the driving pulse train by directing them <lb/>through a dichroic mirror; after propagating through the gas <lb/>cell they were separated from the pulse train by a second <lb/>dichroic mirror and imaged onto the entrance slit of a <lb/>spectrograph. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the results of FDH and TESS measure-<lb/>ments of the wakes driven by a single laser pulse. An <lb/>example wakefield retrieved by FDH is shown in Fig. 2(a): <lb/>the wake can be observed clearly, with a transverse extent <lb/>that is compatible with the focal spot size of the driving <lb/>laser, and with wave fronts that are only slightly curved, <lb/>which is consistent with a linear wakefield. The plasma <lb/>period, read directly from the plot, is found to be <lb/>T p0 ¼ ð90 AE 5Þ fs, which agrees with the expected value <lb/>of T p0 ¼ ð91 AE 2Þ fs for this cell pressure. <lb/>The wake in Fig. 2(a) can be observed up to ζ ≈ 2 ps <lb/>after the pump pulse, corresponding to approximately <lb/>20 plasma periods. This may be compared with the expected <lb/>time for the onset of ion motion T p;ion ¼ ðM=Zm e Þ 1=2 T p0 ≈ <lb/>43T p0 , where M is the ion mass and Z ¼ 1 is the ion charge. <lb/>For these conditions the characteristic time [30] for momen-<lb/>tum transfer by electron-ion collisions is approximately <lb/>τ ei ≈ 48T p0 . These processes are therefore unlikely to be the <lb/>sole cause of the apparent decay of the wakefield. An <lb/>additional reason is the variation of the plasma density along <lb/>the path of the probe pulse, especially near the entrance and <lb/>exit pinholes; in this case the number of measurable plasma <lb/>periods is approximately n e0 =ð2Δn e0 Þ, where Δn e0 is the <lb/>range of density. The data could therefore be fully explained <lb/>by a variation Δn e0 =n e0 ≈ 2.5%. Further work is necessary <lb/>to assess the roles of collisions and ion motion; however, we <lb/>note that our previous particle-in-cell simulations [21] show <lb/>(for a hydrogen pressure of 3.6 mbar) that linear growth of <lb/>the wake amplitude with N could be maintained for trains of <lb/>up to N ¼ 80. <lb/>Figure 2(b) shows, as a function of the cell pressure, a <lb/>waterfall plot of Fourier transforms of the spectral interfero-<lb/>grams. The sideband at t ¼ Δt ≈ 5.1 ps, corresponding to <lb/>the probe-reference separation, can be seen clearly, as can <lb/>the m ¼ AE1 TESS satellites; the separation of these <lb/>satellites, and also of a satellite to the DC peak at t ¼ 0, <lb/>follows closely that expected from the measured GDD of <lb/>the probe pulse and the plasma frequency calculated from <lb/>the initial gas pressure, assuming full ionization by the <lb/>driving laser pulse. The plasma periods determined from <lb/>the FDH and TESS analyses are compared in Fig. 2(c) and <lb/>are seen to be in excellent agreement with each other and <lb/>with the calculated plasma period. <lb/>Figure 3 shows, as a function of cell pressure, the relative <lb/>amplitude of the plasma waves driven by trains of N ¼ 1, <lb/>N ¼ 2, and N ≈ 7 pulses, as determined by TESS analyses. <lb/>In the linear regime the relative amplitude of the plasma <lb/>wave driven by a single driving pulse with Gaussian <lb/>transverse and temporal profiles is [31] <lb/>δn e <lb/>n e0 <lb/>¼ Aω p0 τ 0 <lb/>1 þ <lb/>2 <lb/>ffiffi ffi <lb/>2 <lb/>p <lb/>c <lb/>ω p0 w 0 <lb/>2 <lb/>exp <lb/>− <lb/>ðω p0 τ 0 Þ 2 <lb/>16 ln 2 <lb/>; ð3Þ <lb/>where τ 0 is the full-width at half maximum of the temporal <lb/>profile, and the parameter A is proportional to the peak <lb/>laser intensity. Figure 3(a) shows a fit of Eq. (3) to the data, <lb/>where A and τ 0 are taken as free parameters and ω p0 is <lb/>calculated from the gas pressure. The fit yields τ 0 ¼ <lb/>ð49 AE 8Þ fs, which is consistent with the value of τ 0 ¼ <lb/>ð46 AE 7Þ fs measured with the SSA. Figure 3(a) also shows <lb/>excellent agreement between the data and a fit to the <lb/>wakefield amplitude calculated for the measured temporal <lb/>intensity profile of the driving pulse, the only fitting <lb/>parameter being the parameter A. <lb/>From elementary considerations, in the linear regime the <lb/>relative amplitude of the wakefield behind a train of N <lb/>identical driving pulses spaced in time by δτ is <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>FIG. 2.

Very clear <lb/>constructive and destructive interference of the two wake-<lb/>fields is observed, as expected. A fit to Eq. (4) yields <lb/>δτ ¼ ð407 AE 6Þ fs, which is in agreement with the values of <lb/>ð365 AE 40Þ and ð420 AE 20Þ fs measured by the SSA and <lb/>that deduced from interference fringes observed in the <lb/>spectrum of the two drive pulses. Better agreement with <lb/>the data is obtained if the pressure variation of the wake <lb/>amplitude is calculated from the SSA measurement of the <lb/>intensity profile of the driving pulses. For this fit the free <lb/>parameters were an overall scaling factor for the wake <lb/>amplitude, and a scaling factor α for the temporal axis of <lb/>the measured driving pulses, such that ζ → αζ; the fit <lb/>yields α ¼ 1.11 AE 0.02. An analysis of these data (see <lb/>Supplemental Material [25]) shows that the second (smaller) <lb/>laser pulse reduced the amplitude of the wakefield by <lb/>ð44 AE 8Þ%; this energy is removed from the plasma in <lb/>the form of blue-shifted photons in the trailing laser <lb/>pulse [32,33]. <lb/>Figure 3(c) shows the measured wake amplitude as a <lb/>function of the cell pressure for N ≈ 7 laser pulses. A <lb/>pronounced resonance is observed when the plasma period <lb/>matches the pulse spacing δτ. Also shown is a fit of Eq. (4) <lb/>for a train of N ¼ 7 identical pulses. Once again excellent <lb/>agreement between the data and analytical theory is <lb/>obtained, the fit yielding δτ ¼ ð116 AE 2Þ fs, which agrees <lb/>with the measured value. The solid line shows the variation <lb/>of the wake amplitude calculated for the measured pulse <lb/>train, the fit yielding α ¼ 1.04 AE 0.02. It is noticeable that <lb/>the pressure variation of the wake amplitude calculated for <lb/>the measured pulse train does not exhibit subsidiary <lb/>maxima; this difference is caused by the small variation <lb/>of the pulse spacing, and the presence of temporal wings, in <lb/>the measured pulse train. <lb/>We now place our results in context with earlier work. <lb/>The MP-LWFA approach is closely related to the plasma <lb/>beat-wave accelerator (PBWA) [1,34], in which two long <lb/>laser pulses of angular frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 ¼ ω 1 þ ω p0 <lb/>are combined to form a driving pulse modulated at ω p0 . <lb/>Beat-wave excitation of plasma waves [35-37], and their <lb/>application to accelerating electrons [38,39], have both <lb/>been demonstrated. <lb/>A well-known problem with PBWA is that the relativistic <lb/>increase in electron mass causes a loss of resonance between <lb/>the wakefield and the driver, leading to saturation of the <lb/>wake amplitude at the Rosenbluth-Liu limit [40]. A major <lb/>advantage of MP-LWFA is that this limit can be overcome <lb/>since the pulse spacing does not have to be constant within <lb/>the train. Indeed, MP-LWFA can be considered to be a <lb/>generalization of PBWA since, in addition, the properties of <lb/>each pulse (i.e., the energy, wavelength, duration, etc.) can, <lb/>in principle, be different. The MP-LWFA concept has been <lb/>investigated theoretically [41-49] but has not previously <lb/>been demonstrated experimentally. The idea of using a long <lb/>pulse with temporally nonuniform modulation to overcome <lb/>the Rosenbluth-Liu limit was proposed, within the context of <lb/>PBWA, by Deutsch et al. [50], who suggested using a pair of <lb/>frequency-chirped laser pulses. <lb/>Our results can be considered to be the first experimental <lb/>demonstration of MP-LWFA or of beat-wave excitation <lb/>with chirped laser pulses. In this first demonstration the <lb/>pulse spacing within the train was approximately constant <lb/>since the total available laser pulse energy was low; it <lb/>would be straightforward to maintain resonant excitation <lb/>with large amplitude wakefields by controlling the chirp <lb/>of one or both pulses, for example, by an acousto-optic <lb/>programmable filter [51]. Our results are important since <lb/>they are the first experimental demonstration of wakefield <lb/>excitation by a laser pulse structure that is long compared <lb/>to the plasma period, and which has sufficient control to <lb/>overcome relativistic saturation; as we have shown, this <lb/>approach also offers the potential for energy recovery. The <lb/>ability to deliver the driving laser energy over many plasma <lb/>periods allows the use of high-repetition-rate laser systems, <lb/>such as thin-disk [52] or fiber lasers [53], which cannot <lb/>straightforwardly generate high-energy short laser pulses. <lb/>These results, together with our earlier numerical analysis <lb/>of this scheme [21], indicate a route to achieving highly <lb/>controlled, GeV-scale laser-plasma accelerators operating <lb/>at multikilohertz repetition rates and driven by novel, <lb/>efficient laser technologies. In addition to stimulating <lb/>new work on the development of laser-plasma accelerators, <lb/>these results are of interest to those working on driving <lb/>plasma accelerators driven by trains of particle bunches <lb/>[54,55] or self-modulated proton beams [56,57]. <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>FIG. 3.
