			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The nonlinear control toolbox has built up a fair level of sophistication with the use of techniques <lb/>for input-output and full state linearization, approximate linearization, and bounded tracking for <lb/>nonminimum phase systems. One area in which results have been hard to come by is the tracking of <lb/>singular or non regular nonlinear control systems, i.e. those that fail to have relative degree. While <lb/>the problem of trying to track trajectories that go through singularities was begun by Hirschorn <lb/>and Davis 2] who limited the class of outputs that could be tracked, the rst set of practical <lb/>schemes for approximate asymptotic tracking through singularities was given by Hauser, Sastry <lb/>and Kokotovi c in 1], using an approximation technique. This in turn spurred the development <lb/>of a result by Grizzle, Di Benedetto and Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue 3] which proved the necessity of <lb/>\regularity&quot; for asymptotically exact tracking. <lb/>In parallel with this activity has been the interest in using switching control laws for adaptive <lb/>control ( 4], 5]), for steering and stabilization ( 6], 7]), as well as activity in hybrid control systems <lb/>( 8], 9], 10]). In this paper, we combine ideas from switching along with our results on exact <lb/>tracking of slightly non-minimum phase systems (developed in 11] building on the techniques and <lb/>ideas of 12] and 13]) to describe our results in approximate tracking for singular or non-regular <lb/>nonlinear systems. <lb/>The outline of our paper is as follows: in Section 2 we describe the ball and beam example of 1] with <lb/>some added new insights about the zero dynamics of the singular system under perturbation and <lb/></body>

			<body>the subtleties of introducing switching across the singularity surface into the control law. In Section <lb/>3, we set up the problem formulation for general single-input single-output nonlinear systems, and <lb/>prove approximate tracking for these systems when their zero dynamics are unstable. In Section 4 <lb/>we discuss the nature of the zero dynamics of singular systems which we classify into three cases, <lb/>and in Section 5 we give our current results about tracking using switched controllers. <lb/>For the three classes of systems that we obtain in Section 4, we give conditions for approximate <lb/>tracking. The basic result is that slow switching is acceptable for the third case, where the equilib-<lb/>rium structure is preserved between the exact and approximate internal dynamics. In the rst and <lb/>second case (which is in fact a generalization of our ball and beam example), the change in equi-<lb/>librium in the internal dynamics across the switching boundary is likely to destabilize the switched <lb/>control law. Our results are not counterexamples to the Theorem of 3], since we use discontinuous <lb/>control laws and ask for only asymptotic approximate tracking. <lb/>2 Motivating Example: the ball and beam <lb/>We describe in this section the proposed switching scheme applied to the ball and beam example. <lb/>The insights gained by studying the zero dynamics as the system switches across the singularity <lb/>surface motivate our general formulation in the next section. <lb/>Consider the following system, which describes the motion of a ball rolling along a rotating beam <lb/>1]. The state variables are <lb/>(x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x 4 ) = (r; _ <lb/>r; ; _ ) <lb/>where r is the distance of the ball from the pivot of beam, and is the angle of the beam. In the <lb/>following, G is the acceleration due to gravity, and B := M=(J b =R 2 + M) where M and J b are the <lb/>mass and moment of inertia of the ball, and R is the radius of the ball. The input is the torque <lb/>applied at the center of rotation: a preliminary change of coordinates in the input space, as in 1], <lb/>is performed to de ne a new input variable u which appears linearly in the system equations: <lb/>_ <lb/>x 1 = x 2 <lb/>_ <lb/>x 2 = B(x 1 x 2 <lb/>4 ? G sin x 3 ) <lb/>_ <lb/>x 3 = x 4 <lb/>_ <lb/>x 4 = u <lb/>(1) <lb/>The output equation is y = x 1 ? r 0 , where r 0 is a given position of the ball along the beam. Thus <lb/>f(x) = <lb/>2 <lb/>6 6 6 4 <lb/>x 2 <lb/>B(x 1 x 2 <lb/>4 ? G sin x 3 ) <lb/>x 4 <lb/>0 <lb/>3 <lb/>7 7 7 5 ; g(x) = <lb/>2 <lb/>6 6 6 4 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>7 7 7 5 ; h(x) = x 1 <lb/>The ball and beam system as modeled by (1) is non-regular, meaning that the relative degree of <lb/>the system is not well de ned globally over the state space. Indeed, L g L 2 <lb/>f h(x) = 2Bx 1 x 4 , so that <lb/>the feedback linearizing control is unde ned when x 1 x 4 = 0. In 1], an approximate input-output <lb/>linearization scheme is de ned using the coordinates <lb/>1 = x 1 ? r 0 <lb/>2 = x 2 <lb/>3 = Bx 1 x 2 <lb/>4 ? BG sin x 3 <lb/>4 = Bx 2 x 2 <lb/>4 ? BGx 4 cos x 3 <lb/>(2) <lb/></body>

However, results in 1] show that when j2Bx 1 x 4 j becomes large (which is when <lb/>the values of the desired trajectory and its derivatives become large) the approximate tracking <lb/>scheme is unstable. <lb/>We introduce a switching scheme which uses this approximate scheme in a neighborhood of the <lb/>singularity, and switches to a tracking control based on exact input-output linearization outside of <lb/>this neighborhood. To do this, partition the state space into the regions: <lb/>M 0 = fx 2 R 4 : jx 1 x 4 j &lt; g <lb/>M ? = fx 2 R 4 : x 1 x 4 &lt; ? g <lb/>M + = fx 2 R 4 : x 1 x 4 &gt; g <lb/>In M 0 , we use the control law (4).

The zero dynamics have an unstable node at <lb/>(x 3 ; x 4 ) = (0; 0) and a center equilibrium at (x 3 ; x 4 ) = ( ; 0). As ! 0, the limit cycles around the <lb/>center collapse into the equilibrium, and the center becomes an unstable node. <lb/>We would like the system to track a desired output trajectory y D (t) corresponding to a periodic <lb/>motion of the ball along the beam. The physics of the ball and beam system insist that the state <lb/>trajectory which implements y D (t) traverse the region in which x 1 x 4 = 0, since x 4 must necessarily <lb/>change sign. We de ne a -region around x 1 x 4 = 0 by fx : jx 1 x 4 j g and in this region, <lb/>the approximate tracking law of equation (4) may be used to stabilize the system to y D (t). The <lb/>stabilizing control law may be calculated as <lb/>v = y (4) <lb/>D ? 4 ( 4 ? y (3) <lb/>D ) ? 3 ( 3 ? y (2) <lb/>D ) ? 2 ( 2 ? _ <lb/>y D ) ? 1 ( 1 ? y D ) <lb/>where the i are selected so that s 4 + 4 s 3 + 3 s 2 + 2 s + 1 is Hurwitz. We expect the system to <lb/>stabilize nicely in this region since the zero dynamics corresponds to a single equilibrium. <lb/>In the region fx : jx 1 x 4 j g, the exact tracking law of equation (7) may be used to stabilize the <lb/>output of the system to y D (t). Again, the control law may be calculated as <lb/>v = y (3) <lb/>D ? 3 ( 3 ? y (2) <lb/>D ) ? 2 ( 2 ? _ <lb/>y D ) ? 1 ( 1 ? y D ) <lb/>where s 3 + 3 s 2 + 2 s+ 1 is Hurwitz. Because the zero dynamics in this region is constrained to lie <lb/>on S 1 , we cannot expect such a nice behavior of the inverse dynamics of the system in this region. <lb/></body>

Figure 7 shows <lb/>the results of tracking y D (t) = sin(0:8t) + 3 using switched control. Note that for regulation, the <lb/>switched scheme causes the beam to ip upside down (Figure 4), since the zero dynamics of the <lb/>system (Figure 5) follow S 1 until the switch to approximate tracking occurs. Compare this to the <lb/>approximate linearization scheme in Figure 6 which, although it has larger overshoots and longer <lb/>settling times, regulates the zero dynamics variables to zero. This problem is accentuated in the <lb/>tracking results of Figure 7, where the beam continually ips upside down and right side up. <lb/>3 General Formulation <lb/>We strive for a nonlinear tracking control law which works well both close to singularities in the <lb/>state space, as well as far away from these singularities. The ball and beam example provides <lb/>inspiration. The exactly linearizing control law for the ball and beam system is not useful because <lb/>of the intrinsic system property that the resulting one-dimensional zero dynamics are constrained <lb/>to lie on S 1 . But the same switching method applied to other systems in which the zero dynamics <lb/>(either stable or unstable) are \better behaved&quot; has the potential to be very successful in increasing <lb/>the domains of attraction of the control law. For example, the planar exible robot arm in 14] <lb/>has a singularity at cos 2 = 2 <lb/>3 , where 2 is the angle of the elbow. The exactly linearizing control <lb/>produces two-dimensional zero dynamics which are unstable but hyperbolic, and so the nonlinear <lb/>inversion technique of Devasia, Chen, and Paden 12] may be used away from the singularity to <lb/>calculate the asymptotically stable solution to these dynamics. <lb/>In the general formulation, we will consider single-input single-output controllable nonlinear systems <lb/></body>

Far away from this singular surface, <lb/>jL g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x)j is large, and the approximate control law fails. We propose a switching scheme which <lb/>uses the control law derived from the approximate input-output linearization method of 1] close to <lb/>the singular surface, and switches to a control law derived from exact input-output linearization far <lb/>away from the singular surface. The remainder of this paper is devoted to deriving conditions under <lb/>which such a switching scheme is possible. We approach the problem by classifying the behavior of <lb/>the internal dynamics of systems of the form (26) as the state switches through the singular surface <lb/>L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) = 0. <lb/>4 Classi cation of the Internal Dynamics <lb/>Consider the system (26). The internal dynamics of the system are the (n ? + 1)-dimensional <lb/>\exact internal dynamics&quot; in the region in which L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) 6 = 0: <lb/>_ = L f h(x) + L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x)u ex (x) <lb/>_ = q( ; ) <lb/>(27) <lb/></body>

			<body>and the (n ? )-dimensional \approximate internal dynamics&quot; when L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) = 0: <lb/>_ = q( ; ) <lb/>(28) <lb/>Let us analyze the exact and approximate zero and driven dynamics as the state switches through <lb/>x 0 . <lb/>Exact Internal Dynamics <lb/>Assuming that L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) 6 = 0, consider the exact control law u ex <lb/>0 (x) required to hold the output <lb/>and its derivatives identically at zero: <lb/>L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) + L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x)u ex <lb/>0 (x) = 0 <lb/>(29) <lb/>As the state trajectory approaches x 0 , this control law becomes <lb/>u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) = lim <lb/>x!x 0 ? <lb/>L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) <lb/>L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) <lb/>(30) <lb/>Note that for the class of singular systems that we are considering both the numerator L ?1 <lb/>f h(x 0 ) <lb/>and denominator L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x 0 ) of this limit vanish, since f(x 0 ) = 0, and x 0 2 M 0 . But because the <lb/>numerator and denominator are both analytic functions, we can rewrite (29) as <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) r q 1 (x) + (x ? x 0 ) s q 2 (x)u ex <lb/>0 (x) = 0 <lb/>(31) <lb/>where q 1 (x 0 ) 6 = 0, q 2 (x 0 ) 6 = 0, and r &gt; 0 (again since f(x 0 ) = 0). <lb/>For the driven dynamics, if the desired output is y D (t), the required input u ex (t) may be calculated <lb/>from <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) r q 1 (x) + (x ? x 0 ) s q 2 (x)u ex (x) = y ?1 <lb/>D (t) <lb/>(32) <lb/>We consider three cases: <lb/>1. No Zero Dynamics: s &gt; r, u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) = 1. <lb/>In this case, there does not exist an input u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) to hold the output and its derivatives at <lb/>zero. <lb/>We may still study the nonlinear zeros of the driven system, which are the eigenvalues of <lb/>the Jacobian linearization about x 0 of the driven dynamics. Substituting u ex (x) into the <lb/>linearized equation for _ and forcing the system towards x 0 results in the term: <lb/>L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) ( ?q 1 (x) <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) s?r q 2 (x) + <lb/>y ?1 <lb/>D <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) s q 2 (x) ) <lb/>x!x 0 <lb/>As x goes through x 0 , the denominators of these terms may change sign, depending on s <lb/>and r. This corresponds to an eigenvalue of the linearized driven dynamics either moving to <lb/>?1 in the left half plane and returning at 1 in the right half plane, or moving to 1 in the <lb/>right half plane and returning at ?1 in the left half plane. This suggests that the internal <lb/>dynamics may become unstable as the system switches through x 0 . <lb/></body>

			<body>2. Change in Equilibrium of the Zero Dynamics: s = r, u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) = ? q 1 (x 0 ) <lb/>q 2 (x 0 ) . <lb/>The ball and beam is an example of a system of this class. In this case, the zero dynamics <lb/>exist and are the dynamics of <lb/>_ <lb/>x = f(x) + g(x)u ex <lb/>0 (x)j M=fx:h(x)=L f h(x)=:::=L ?2 <lb/>f h(x)=0g <lb/>(33) <lb/>Since u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) 6 = 0, x 0 is not an equilibrium of (33). This is interesting, since it means that a <lb/>feedback linearizing control may trigger \higher order&quot; zero dynamics in the switching from <lb/>an approximate to an exact control law. This is evident in the ball and beam example. <lb/>In this case the linearized driven dynamics include the term <lb/>L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) ( ?q 1 (x) <lb/>q 2 (x) + <lb/>y ?1 <lb/>D <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) s q 2 (x) ) <lb/>x!x 0 <lb/>which, depending on y D (t), may cause a stable eigenvalue to become unstable as the system <lb/>switches through x 0 . <lb/>3. No qualitative change in the Zero Dynamics: s &lt; r, u ex <lb/>0 (x 0 ) = 0. <lb/>In this case the zero dynamics exist and have an equilibrium point at x 0 . <lb/>The driven dynamics include the term <lb/>L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) ( y ?1 <lb/>D <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) s q 2 (x) ) <lb/>x!x 0 <lb/>which again, depending on y D (t), may cause the driven dynamics to become unstable on one <lb/>side of the singular surface. <lb/>Approximate Internal Dynamics <lb/>Now consider the approximate control law u app <lb/>0 <lb/>(x) required to hold the approximate system&apos;s output <lb/>and its derivatives at zero: <lb/>L f h(x) + L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x)u app <lb/>0 <lb/>(x) = 0 <lb/>(34) <lb/>so that <lb/>u app <lb/>0 <lb/>(x 0 ) = lim <lb/>x!x 0 ? <lb/>L f h(x) <lb/>L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x) <lb/>(35) <lb/>We can rewrite (34) as <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) r 0 q 0 <lb/>1 (x) + q 0 <lb/>2 (x)u app <lb/>0 <lb/>(x) = 0 <lb/>(36) <lb/>where q 0 <lb/>1 (x 0 ) 6 = 0, q 0 <lb/>2 (x 0 ) 6 = 0, and r 0 &gt; 0 (note that L g L ?1 <lb/>f h(x 0 ) 6 = 0 since the robust relative <lb/>degree is ). The only solution to this is u app <lb/>0 <lb/>(x 0 ) = 0, so that x 0 is always an equilibrium of the <lb/>approximate zero dynamics. <lb/>For the approximate driven dynamics, if the desired output is y D (t), the required input u app (t) <lb/>may be calculated from <lb/>(x ? x 0 ) r 0 q 0 <lb/>1 (x) + q 0 <lb/>2 (x)u app (x) = y D (t) <lb/>(37) <lb/></body>

As <lb/>we saw in Section 2, the switching control in the ball and beam example triggered higher order zero <lb/>dynamics (a limit cycle with no equilibria) resulting in cyclic oscillations of the beam from 0 to <lb/>and back. This seems to be a prototype behavior for the general case: in the tracking problem, <lb/>while the driven dynamics would remain bounded, they may not go to zero as (y D ; _ <lb/>y D ; : : :) goes to <lb/>zero. Our conclusions are that for this class of singular systems, it is best to not use a switching <lb/>control law, but to use the approximate control law (39) for small enough values of y D ( ) and its <lb/>derivatives. Thus, for this class of nonlinear systems there are intrinsic limitations to the magnitude <lb/>of the inputs and their derivatives that can be approximately tracked. <lb/>In the next section, we prove approximate tracking for \slow switching&quot;, for case 3 above. <lb/>5 Tracking y D (t) <lb/>Consider the system (26).

The main drawback of the <lb/>computations involved in the Devasia et al. scheme is that it involves computation of the \steady <lb/>state&quot; response as discussed in 11]. To address this, we will assume that the rate of switching <lb/>is slow compared to the zero dynamics of the exact and approximate system. We formalize this <lb/>assumption in the following de nition: <lb/>De nition 4 (Slow Switching) Let ft i g i2I be the sequence of switching times indexed by the set <lb/>I.

We now state the approximate tracking theorem using switching for the case <lb/>in which the system satis es the assumptions of slow switching. <lb/></body>

			<body>Theorem 5 (Approximate Tracking Using Switching Control) Consider the system (10) <lb/>with normal form (26), and with the control law switching between (39) and (41) at the surfaces <lb/>fx 2 R n : L g L ?2 <lb/>f h(x) = g <lb/>Assume that conditions 1 ? 3 of Theorem 3 hold for both the approximate internal dynamics and <lb/>the exact internal dynamics, thus the state x D in control laws (39), (41) is computed by applying <lb/>the Devasia-Paden-Chen scheme to the approximate internal dynamics dynamics of (28) and exact <lb/>internal dynamics of (27) respectively. <lb/>Then, if the desired trajectory y D ( ) is such that the conditions of slow switching are satis ed, for <lb/>small enough , the switching control law results in asymptotic approximate tracking with output <lb/>error less than or equal to K with all state variables bounded. <lb/>Sketch of proof: We prove that for the conditions stated above, the error in approximating D (t) <lb/>(17) with the truncated version ~ D (t) (44) is small. <lb/>Let be the smallest eigenvalue of app in (40) and ex in (42). <lb/>Subtracting equation (44) from (17) and assuming that t is xed and lies in the interval ? T <lb/>2 ; T <lb/>2 ]: <lb/>j D ? ~ D j <lb/>j <lb/>Z 1 <lb/>T <lb/>(t ? )r( D ; D )d j + j <lb/>Z ?T <lb/>?1 <lb/>(t ? )r( D ; D )d j <lb/>+ j <lb/>Z T <lb/>?T <lb/>(t ? ) r( D ; D ) ? r( D ; ~ D )]d j <lb/>(46) <lb/>M 1 (T ) + <lb/>Z T <lb/>?T <lb/>j (t ? )jK 2 j D ? ~ D j <lb/>(47) <lb/>Since the zero dynamics are hyperbolic, <lb/>j (t ? )j <lb/>K 3 e ? (t? ) for t <lb/>j (t ? )j <lb/>K 3 e (t? ) for t <lb/>then it follows from the Bellman-Gronwall lemma that <lb/>j D ? ~ D j M 1 (T )e ?M 2 (T ) <lb/>(48) <lb/>with both M 1 and M 2 decreasing functions of T. Thus, if T is chosen large enough (as per the <lb/>de nition of slow switching) then the error introduced by switching in the computation of the <lb/>desired trajectory is small. Now, continuing the analysis along the lines of 1], we can establish <lb/>that jy(t) ? y D (t)j K 3 for t large enough. <lb/>Though none of the cases discussed above are explicitly mentioned here, the conditions for slow <lb/>switching are unlikely to be met in cases 1 and 2, because the change in equilibrium across the <lb/>switching boundary would cause larger tracking errors and thus require a longer time T to compute <lb/>the stable solution to the internal dynamics. For case 3, provided that the frequency of the signal <lb/>being tracked is not too high and the amplitude is small enough, the condition of slow switching is <lb/>likely to be met. This presents a limitation to the size of the signal being tracked and its derivatives. <lb/>Remark 1 The linear stabilizing terms f app T and f ex T should be such that the closed loop <lb/>system A c (t) has eigenvalues which are greater than the slowest eigenvalues of the zero dynamics. <lb/></body>

			<body>Remark 2 Theorem 5 clearly holds if the number of switches is nite provided that the switches <lb/>are placed far enough apart. <lb/>Remark 3 In light of the discussion before Theorem 5 about the need for \steady state&quot; calcula-<lb/>tions in the Devasia-Paden-Chen scheme, we feel that the foregoing switching control is not a good <lb/>alternative to approximate linearization if the switching is fast. <lb/>Remark 4 Even though the last step of the proof of Theorem 5 uses the method of 1], it is <lb/>important to note that the theorem is di erent and may yield better asymptotic tracking because <lb/>of the switching. <lb/>6 Conclusions <lb/>The ball and beam example is used to motivate the study of a tracking control law which switches <lb/>between an approximate tracking law close to singularities in the state space, and an exact tracking <lb/>law away from these singularities. We study a general nonlinear system (10) which has relative <lb/>degree ? 1 and robust relative degree . We rst prove that if the system has unstable zero <lb/>dynamics, then approximate tracking can be achieved using the nonlinear inversion technique of <lb/>12] to calculate the stable solution to the zero dynamics. We then classify the zero dynamics of <lb/>the general system into three cases, in which the rst two involve a change in equilibrium of the <lb/>zero dynamics across the switching boundary. We prove approximate tracking for the third case, in <lb/>which there is no change in equilibrium, using the assumption that switching must be slow. For the <lb/>rst two cases, we advise that a tracking control law based on approximate tracking alone should <lb/>be used. <lb/></body>
