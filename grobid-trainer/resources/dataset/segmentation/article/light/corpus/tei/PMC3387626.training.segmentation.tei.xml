Clinical data regarding survival and <lb/>microbiological burden are missing. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the &apos;late <lb/>phase&apos; of sepsis with respect to overall survival and occurrence of microbiological findings. <lb/>Methods: In a retrospective trial, 16,041 patient charts from a university intensive care unit were screened, and 999 <lb/>patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were identified. Three phases were established according to the <lb/>mortality peaks which were separated by two distinct nadirs: phase I (days 1 to 5), phase II (days 6 to 15) and <lb/>phase III (days 16 to 150). Patients were analyzed for outcome, SOFA scores, procalcitonin levels, antimicrobial <lb/>treatment, dialysis, mechanical ventilation and results of blood cultures during their hospital stay. <lb/>Results: Out of 999 enrolled patients, 308 died during the course of sepsis presenting a characteristic mortality rate <lb/>(30.8%) with three distinct mortality peaks (at days 2, 7 and 17). Overall 36.7% of all deaths occurred in the early <lb/>phase (phase I) and 63.3% during the later phases (phase II + III). In total 2,117 blood cultures were drawn. In <lb/>phase I, 882 blood cultures were drawn, representing a sampling rate of 88% with a positive rate of 14.9%. In <lb/>phase II, 461 samples were taken, indicating a sampling rate of 52% and a positive rate of 11.3%. Within phase III, <lb/>524 samples were obtained representing a sampling rate of 66% with a positive rate of 15.3%, which was <lb/>significantly higher compared to the positive rate of phase II and similar to phase I. In particular, the rate of <lb/>typically opportunistic bacteria increased significantly from 9% in phase I up to 18% in phase III. The same is true <lb/>for Candida spp. (phase I 13%, phase III 30%). <lb/>Conclusions: The later phase of sepsis is associated with a significant re-increase of positive blood culture results, <lb/>especially regarding opportunistic bacteria and fungi. These observations warrant further studies focusing on the <lb/>underlying mechanisms resulting in this outcome burden in the later phase of sepsis. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Despite aggressive supportive care to improve treatment <lb/>options and outcome, sepsis and its sequelae remain a <lb/>leading cause of death in intensive care units [1]. Exten-<lb/>sive studies investigating the host responses during sep-<lb/>sis have revealed that the late phase of sepsis is <lb/>dominated by a status of immune suppression with <lb/>respect to missing or widespread depressed innate, as <lb/>well as adaptive, immune defense mechanisms. Since <lb/>various authors introduced the intriguing model of a <lb/>phase-dependent variation of immune activity [2-4], the <lb/>concept of an anergic immune system is held responsi-<lb/>ble as a principal mechanism and cause of death in <lb/>patients with sepsis [5,6]. However, the concept itself, <lb/>but more the impact of sequential hyper-and hypo-<lb/>inflammatory phases, has been discussed controversially <lb/>[7-9]. The lack of tools assessing the individual immune <lb/>status of patients at the bedside and the complex patho-<lb/>physiological processes, which are often overlapping, <lb/>have so far limited the meaning of such concepts <lb/>describing hyper-and hypo-inflammatory immune <lb/>phases for the clinician. Confirmatory studies demon-<lb/>strating the clinical significance, especially of the so-<lb/>called late phase in sepsis, are largely missing. We, <lb/></body>

			<body>therefore, thought to investigate whether a so-called late <lb/>phase during the course of sepsis would be accompanied <lb/>by higher death rates and higher rates of positive blood <lb/>culture results, especially by typically opportunistic bac-<lb/>teria. The latter might be interpreted as a hint for an <lb/>underlying immune suppressive status, which has been <lb/>suggested by many studies investigating separate <lb/>immune defense mechanisms in patients suffering from <lb/>sepsis [2,3,6,9]. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>To clarify this question we used a large database of <lb/>patient records from daily practice and performed a ret-<lb/>rospective trial enrolling patients admitted from 1 Janu-<lb/>ary 2006 to 31 December 2009 to the intensive care unit <lb/>of the Jena university hospital. The study was approved <lb/>by the institutional review board of Friedrich Schiller <lb/>University Hospital, Jena, Germany (3080-03/11). <lb/>Informed consent was waived due to the anonymous <lb/>nature of the analysis. A total of 16,041 patients were <lb/>screened according to the criteria of the American Col-<lb/>lege of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medi-<lb/>cine (ACCP/SCCM) for severe sepsis or septic shock <lb/>[10,11]. We identified 999 patients qualifying for severe <lb/>sepsis or septic shock and evaluated demographics, clini-<lb/>cal characteristics, disease severity measured by SOFA <lb/>score [12,13], procalcitonin levels (PCT), requirement of <lb/>renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation, <lb/>and outcome of patients, as well as the results of micro-<lb/>biological blood cultures and antimicrobial treatment. <lb/>By the observed trajectory of mortality, periods with <lb/>different mortality rates were identified and classified by <lb/>the nadirs, yielding in the definition of three distinct <lb/>phases: Phase I from Day 1 until Day 5, phase II from <lb/>Day 6 until Day 15 and phase III from Day 16 until the <lb/>end of the observation period at Day 150. To investigate <lb/>the relevance of the various phases, analyses of all <lb/>obtained blood cultures with respect to their date of <lb/>sampling during patients&apos; hospital stay were performed. <lb/>In addition, samples taken 10 days prior to clinical diag-<lb/>nosis of sepsis were included and this time period was <lb/>defined as phase 0 (Day -10 to Day -1). Coagulase nega-<lb/>tive staphylococci (CNS) were interpreted as skin con-<lb/>tamination of no importance and presented separately. <lb/>Furthermore, epidemiology of microorganisms in the <lb/>different phases was analyzed. Beside the total number <lb/>of positive findings, the relative numbers of drawn <lb/>blood cultures in relation to the number of patients <lb/>alive during that period and, in particular, the rate of <lb/>positive findings per obtained samples during the corre-<lb/>sponding phase were also analyzed. Additionally, the <lb/>practice of antimicrobial treatment and clinical charac-<lb/>teristics of patients were studied dependent of the <lb/>defined phases and dependent of the results from the <lb/>obtained blood cultures at the day of sampling. <lb/>Statistics <lb/>All data are reported as relative numbers, including ori-<lb/>ginal absolute numbers. A Chi-square test was used for <lb/>comparisons of categorical data. Continuous data across <lb/>multiple groups were compared by ANOVA testing with <lb/>Bonferroni adjustment. P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered <lb/>significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS software <lb/>(version 13) from SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL, USA). <lb/>Results <lb/>Demographics, clinical characteristics and outcome <lb/>An overview of the demographics and clinical character-<lb/>istics from the identified patients with severe sepsis or <lb/>septic shock is given in Table 1. Out of these 999 <lb/>patients, 308 died during the course of severe sepsis or <lb/>septic shock. The outcome data plotted from first onset <lb/>of sepsis until Day 36 of these enrolled patients were <lb/>characterized by three peaks of increased mortality <lb/>rates. The first one occurred at Day 2 after reported <lb/>diagnosis, the second one at Day 7 and the last one at <lb/>around Day 17 (Figure 1). In agreement with the <lb/>addressed concept of a late phase of sepsis, the second <lb/>and third maximum values might pertain to this phase <lb/>of sepsis. The further analyses were strictly performed <lb/>according to the defined phases by the observed nadirs <lb/>of mortality rate (phase I: Day 1 until Day 5, phase II: <lb/>Day 6 until Day 15, phase III: Day 16 until the end of <lb/>the observation period at Day 150). <lb/>Table 1 Demographics and clinical characteristics of <lb/>enrolled patients with severe sepsis or septic shock <lb/>Demographics and clinical characteristics <lb/>Gender, male/female, # <lb/>660/339 <lb/>Age (years), median (IQR) <lb/>67 (56 to 75) <lb/>BMI (kg/m 2 ), median (IQR) <lb/>26.3 (23.9 to 29.6) <lb/>APACHE II Score at admission, median (IQR) <lb/>14 (11 to 19) <lb/>Type of ICU admission <lb/>Medical, # (%) <lb/>410 (41) <lb/>Surgical, # (%) <lb/>589 (59) <lb/>Co-morbid conditions, # (%) <lb/>Hypertension <lb/>533 (53) <lb/>Diabetes <lb/>305 (31) <lb/>Cancer <lb/>272 (27) <lb/>Intestinal ischemia <lb/>96 (10) <lb/>Liver failure <lb/>78 (8) <lb/>Characteristics of patients enrolled.

			<body>Out of all deaths, 36.7% occurred before the end of <lb/>Day 5 during phase I and 63.3% (30.8% phase II and <lb/>32.5% phase III) during the following period (phase I vs. <lb/>phase II + III P ≤ 0.01; c 2 test) (Table 2). The mortality <lb/>rate of the later phase was 22% (10.7% phase II and <lb/>12.6% phase III) -significantly higher than in the early <lb/>phase I with 11.3% (phase I vs. phase II + III P ≤ 0.01; <lb/>c 2 test). With regard to these numbers, the later phases <lb/>of sepsis, phase II and, especially, phase III, demon-<lb/>strated a broad clinical significance. <lb/>Positive blood cultures without CNS <lb/>In total, 2,117 blood cultures were drawn. Prior to diag-<lb/>nosis in phase 0, 250 blood cultures were obtained, <lb/>equaling a sampling rate of 25%, of which 9.6% were <lb/>positive. During phase I, 882 blood cultures were drawn, <lb/>representing a sampling rate of 88.3% with a positive <lb/>rate of 14.9%. For the 886 patients alive in phase II, 461 <lb/>samples were taken indicating a sampling rate of 52% <lb/>and a positive rate of 11.3%. In the last phase III from <lb/>Day 16 until Day 150, 524 samples were obtained repre-<lb/>senting a sampling rate of 66.2% with a positive rate of <lb/>15.3% (Table 2). There was a significant reduction in <lb/>the numbers of drawn specimens per patient in phase II <lb/>(phase II vs. phase I P ≤ 0.01; c 2 test) and a significant <lb/>re-increase in phase III (phase III vs. phase II P ≤ 0.01; <lb/>c 2 test). A significant increase in the rate of positive <lb/>blood cultures was found in phase I compared to phase <lb/>0 (P ≤ 0.05; c 2 test), the rate of positive findings <lb/>dropped in phase II (P ≤ 0.05; c 2 test) and rose again in <lb/>phase III (P ≤ 0.05; c 2 test) comparable to levels of <lb/>phase I (P &gt; 0.05; c 2 test). <lb/>Epidemiology of microorganisms <lb/>A detailed overview of the epidemiology of isolated <lb/>microorganisms depicted according to the different <lb/>Figure 1 Distribution of non survivors and positive blood cultures during sepsis.

			<body>phases is presented in the online data supplement and a <lb/>short overview in Table 3 (see also, Additional file 1). <lb/>The rate of bacteria classified as typically opportunistic <lb/>bacteria (TOB) increased over time from 7.7% in phase <lb/>0 up to 17.8% in phase III. In phase III, TOB were sig-<lb/>nificantly more often identified in comparison to phase <lb/>1 (phase I vs. phase III P ≤ 0.05; c 2 test). Furthermore, <lb/>the rate of isolated Candida spp. increased from 7.7% in <lb/>phase 0 up to 35.7% in phase II and 30% in phase III. <lb/>Both later phases were characterized by a significantly <lb/>higher rate of Candida spp. compared to both earlier <lb/>phases (phase II or III vs. phase 0 or I; P ≤ 0.05; c 2 <lb/>test). The rate of CNS ranged from 50.9% in phase 0 to <lb/>26.7% in phase I (phase I vs. phases 0, II, III; P ≤ 0.01; <lb/>c 2 test). <lb/>Severity and use of antimicrobials <lb/>In the severity of disease measured by SOFA score, as <lb/>well as in the course of PCT as a prototypic biomarker <lb/>of infection, significant differences were found between <lb/>the various phases. In phase I, both parameters peaked <lb/>with the highest levels (phase I vs. phases 0, II, III; P ≤ <lb/>0.01; ANOVA, Table 4) and fell over time to reach the <lb/>lowest levels at phase III (phase III vs. phases 0, I, II; P <lb/>≤ 0.01; ANOVA). The same was true for the require-<lb/>ment of mechanical ventilation with the highest rate of <lb/>90.9% in phase I (phase I vs. phases 0, II, III; P ≤ 0.01; <lb/>c 2 test). In the use of renal replacement therapy with <lb/>exception of phase 0, in which only 13% and, therefore, <lb/>significantly fewer patients needed dialyses, no signifi-<lb/>cant differences between the phases were found (phase <lb/>0 vs. phases I, II, III; P ≤ 0.01; ANOVA). <lb/>The rates of antimycotic therapy increased signifi-<lb/>cantly over time with the highest rate of 28.7% during <lb/>phase III (phase III vs. phases 0, I, II; P ≤ 0.01; c 2 test). <lb/>Azole antifungal drugs were prescribed most often. <lb/>Antibiotic treatment was performed most often in phase <lb/>I with a rate of 97.5% (phase I vs. phases 0, II, III; P ≤ <lb/>0.01; c 2 test). The primarily used antibiotics during this <lb/>time were carbapenems and glycopeptides. <lb/>Additional analyses, referring to the various phases <lb/>and results of blood cultures were performed, including <lb/>the SOFA score, PCT levels and the requirement of <lb/>mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy <lb/>on the day the corresponding blood culture was <lb/>sampled.

In contrast, higher PCT levels and rates of <lb/>mechanical ventilations were found in patients with <lb/>positive blood cultures during observation phase I, <lb/>phase II and phase III (bc -vs. bc + in phases I, II, III; P ≤ <lb/>0.05; c 2 test and ANOVA).

A total of 63.3% of all <lb/>deaths occurred during the defined late phases II and <lb/>III, which implicates a broad clinical significance. <lb/>Furthermore, our data demonstrate a significantly <lb/>renewed rate of positive blood cultures occurring in <lb/>phase III of sepsis, as well as the highest rates of TOB <lb/>in this phase. High positive rates of blood cultures, and <lb/>especially the rise of TOB during this phase, may indi-<lb/>cate either an inability to overcome underlying infec-<lb/>tions or a possible increase in secondary infections.

			<body>rate of drawn blood culture samples is comparable over-<lb/>all to data from available literature and representative of <lb/>practice patterns [14,15]. However, we observed an <lb/>expected and significant reduction in the numbers of <lb/>drawn specimens per patient in phase II and, surpris-<lb/>ingly, a significant increase in phase III. <lb/>The rates of positive cultures ranged from 9.6% prior <lb/>to diagnosis, significantly up to 14.9% during phase I, <lb/>dropping during phase II to levels of 11.3% and rising <lb/>again to 15.3% during the last observational period -<lb/>phase III. These significant patterns of positive findings <lb/>and the increase of TOB from 9.1% in phase I up to <lb/>17.8% in phase III might indicate an inability to clear <lb/>persistent infections or the appearance of new, second-<lb/>ary infections, and potentially suggest the clinical signifi-<lb/>cance of the late phase of sepsis. It might be speculated <lb/>that one of the underlying reasons could be the pro-<lb/>posed immune compromised status of patients with sep-<lb/>sis developing during the progression of disease. <lb/>Additionally, the rate of Candida spp. significantly <lb/>increased from 12.6% in phase I up to 35.7% in phase II, <lb/>and to 30.0% in phase III. An underlying mechanism <lb/>might be the frequent use of antibiotics in phase I. <lb/>In this retrospective review, we attempt to explore the <lb/>clinically impacted and microbiological pattern of the <lb/>late phase of sepsis as a cause of late morbidity and <lb/>mortality by dividing sepsis, according to the observed <lb/>mortality peaks, into three periods. We detected a sig-<lb/>nificant increase of positive blood cultures drawn in <lb/>patients with sepsis at a later time point with higher <lb/>rates of TOB, which may indicate an anergic immune <lb/>system. It needs to be understood that such implications <lb/>have a number of important drawbacks due to the <lb/>design of this study. First, the demonstrated higher fre-<lb/>quency rate of positive cultures will be very sensitive to <lb/>existing practice patterns. In our ICU the decision to <lb/>draw cultures will be taken according to the guidelines <lb/>recommending a sampling by signs and symptoms of <lb/>infections as a new onset of fever, chills, hypothermia, <lb/>leukocytosis, PCT (demonstrated by the high levels in <lb/>bc +/-patients at the sampling day) or a raise in CRP, <lb/>neutropenia or left shift in differential blood count. In <lb/>our opinion, sampling based on guidelines without a <lb/>prospective investigative protocol reflects the situation <lb/>on ICU more reliably. The sampling rate clearly shows a <lb/>drop from 88.3% in phase I to 52% in phase II and a <lb/>rise up to 66.2% in phase III. This might demonstrate <lb/>the still ongoing inflammatory response in these <lb/>patients, especially after phase I and II in which almost <lb/>all of our patients had already received guideline-appro-<lb/>priate antibiotic treatment. In contrast to the early <lb/>phase, in which well described guidelines for the sam-<lb/>pling indication and procedure exist, the indication for <lb/>blood culture sampling during the late time points are <lb/>often also determined by the clinical phenotype and <lb/>may not be as precisely captured when compared to the <lb/>onset phase. This fact represents a confounder which is <lb/>very difficult to control. Within this study, we used a <lb/>definition of TOB. However, a precise definition of TOB <lb/>does not exist, and it must be pointed out that our clas-<lb/>sification was based on data from the literature and the <lb/>expert opinion of microbiologists and intensive care <lb/>physicians, which may also represent a drawback with <lb/>respect to derived implications. A further limitation of <lb/>this study might be that there is important informative <lb/>censoring going on; patients who die early contribute to <lb/>the initial blood culture sampling quota but obviously <lb/>not to the later ones. In contrast, patients who did well <lb/>and left the ICU and were sampled later were still <lb/>included in our analyses. Patients who did well and left <lb/>the hospital were not observed further. However, all <lb/>three scenarios provoke no bias for the rate of positive <lb/>blood cultures. Also limiting might be the fact that the <lb/>number and the duration of uses of a central venous <lb/>catheter were not included in our analyses. Only the <lb/>requirement of mechanical ventilation and renal replace-<lb/>ment therapy as additional risk factors for infections <lb/>were analyzed in greater detail. This study shows that <lb/>patients with sepsis treated on our ICU at a later time <lb/>point (&gt;16 days) were still or even more likely to exhibit <lb/>a positive blood culture in comparison to earlier time <lb/>points and that such patients are more prone to develop <lb/>TOBs. Of course, these results are not necessarily a <lb/>legitimate or validated proxy for an anergic immune sys-<lb/>tem, but due to the absence of a clinically established <lb/>and relevant indicator for immune suppression in daily <lb/>practices, the data might serve as further hints for this <lb/>hypothesis, which has been much more clearly described <lb/>in models of experimental sepsis. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Most of the adjunctive clinical trials that were con-<lb/>ducted with the aim to treat sepsis focused on early and <lb/>anti-inflammatory mechanisms abrogating hyper-inflam-<lb/>mation, with most of them failing to deliver the antici-<lb/>pated results [16-22]. Only a few trials were designed <lb/>with a strategy aimed at the later phases or at improving <lb/>immune suppression [23-25]. However, both strategies <lb/>have so far not resulted in new therapeutics capable of <lb/>significantly improving outcomes of septic patients. Our <lb/>data demonstrate that the later phase of sepsis is asso-<lb/>ciated with a significant re-increase of positive blood <lb/>culture results, especially opportunistic bacteria and <lb/>fungi, and that a majority of all deaths occurred after <lb/>Day 5. These data have a large potential impact on <lb/>treatment, monitoring and outcome of septic patients. <lb/>However, the underlying mechanisms are so far not well <lb/>understood. It, therefore, appears to be warranted to pay <lb/></body>

			<body>more attention to the late phase of sepsis and to develop <lb/>strategies detecting the patients&apos; host immune response <lb/>level. <lb/>Key messages <lb/>• The time course of disease in a large population of <lb/>patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock <lb/>was characterized by three different mortality peaks, <lb/>which suggests that these patients undergo phases <lb/>which may also be dominated by different underly-<lb/>ing pathophysiological mechanisms. <lb/>• The late phase of sepsis is characterized by a sig-<lb/>nificant resurgence of positive blood culture findings, <lb/>which underlines the importance of the innate <lb/>immune responses in this phase. <lb/>• Positive microbiological findings of opportunistic <lb/>bacteria and Candida spp. increase over the length <lb/>of ICU stay in patients with severe sepsis and septic <lb/>shock. <lb/>• In sepsis, diagnostic tools monitoring the immune <lb/>status as well as therapies aimed at restoring the <lb/>immune response are urgently needed. <lb/></body>
