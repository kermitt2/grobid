Delivery of vascular endothelial<lb/> growth factor (VEGF) protein or gene transfer has<lb/> been shown to accelerate re-endothelialization and at-<lb/>tenuate neointimal hyperplasia in various arterial in-<lb/>jury models, including balloon injury, stent implanta-<lb/>tion, and vein grafts. In addition to stimulating re-<lb/>endothelialization, we hypothesize that VEGF has<lb/> further vascular protective functions to prevent neo-<lb/>intimal hyperplasia by directly inhibiting mitogen-<lb/>induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells<lb/> (VSMCs) via the mitogen-activated protein kinase<lb/> pathway.<lb/> Materials and methods. Human aortic VSMCs were<lb/> seeded and serum starved for 24 h. The cells were then<lb/> stimulated with a mitogen, recombinant human plate-<lb/>let derived growth factor at 20 ng/mL together with 0,<lb/> 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ng/mL recombinant human VEGF. A<lb/> proliferation assay was used to quantitate bromode-<lb/>oxyuridine uptake into newly synthesized DNA. West-<lb/>ern immunoassay was used to quantify extracellular<lb/> signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 protein and phos-<lb/>phorylation of retinoblastoma and ERK 1/2 protein.<lb/> Results. VEGF inhibited bromodeoxyuridine incor-<lb/>poration into mitogen-induced VSMC in a dose-<lb/>dependent manner, reaching statistical significance at<lb/> concentrations of 30 (P &lt; 0.05), 40 (P &lt; 0.05), and 50<lb/> ng/mL (P &lt; 0.01). Densitometry of western immuno-<lb/>blots revealed an inhibition of phosphorylation of ret-<lb/>inoblastoma at VEGF concentrations of 40 and 50<lb/> ng/mL and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation at concentrations<lb/> of 30, 40 and 50 ng/mL.<lb/> Conclusion. In addition to stimulating re-<lb/>endothelialization, VEGF appears to have a vascular<lb/> protective function by directly inhibiting VSMC pro-<lb/>liferation. This effect occurs in the absence of endo-<lb/>thelial cells and via the mitogen-activated protein ki-<lb/>nase pathway. VEGF may serve as an important<lb/> modulator of mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation af-<lb/>ter vascular injury. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

			<body>INTRODUCTION<lb/> The treatment of arterial occlusive disease, whether<lb/> it is in the coronary, peripheral, or cerebrovascular<lb/> circulation, has evolved considerably both with regard<lb/> to operative techniques as well as angioplasty and<lb/> stenting. Although these aggressive revascularization<lb/> techniques have resulted in better outcomes, the suc-<lb/>cess of these treatments is limited by a finite failure<lb/> rate because of restenosis resulting from neointimal<lb/> hyperplasia. The incidence of this conduit failure is<lb/> high, with restenosis rates of up to 32% after coronary<lb/> stenting at 6-month follow up [1] and 31% after carotid<lb/> endarterectomy at 7 years [2].<lb/> Neointimal hyperplasia results from injury to the<lb/> endothelial lining leading to the activation and uncon-<lb/>trolled proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells<lb/> (VSMCs) within the medial layer of the blood vessel.<lb/> VSMCs then migrate from the medial layer to the<lb/> intimal layer, secrete and deposit matrix, and cause<lb/> intimal thickening. This results in luminal narrowing<lb/> </body>

			<body>of the vessel and can eventually lead to thrombosis and<lb/> failure of the intervention or graft [3, 4].<lb/> Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is produced<lb/> by endothelial cells [5], VSMCs [6], activated macro-<lb/>phages [7], and from platelets in thrombi [8] and is<lb/> thought to be important in lesion formation. Increased<lb/> expression of PDGF and PDGF receptors have been<lb/> shown in neointimal lesions after balloon catheter in-<lb/>jury [9, 10] and percutaneous transluminal coronary<lb/> angioplasty [11]. Furthermore, PDGF-BB infusion into<lb/> rats after carotid injury directly promoted neointimal<lb/> thickening [12]. PDGF binding to its receptor is known<lb/> to result in an increase of the active, GTP-bound form<lb/> of Ras [13]. This in turn activates the signaling in the<lb/> Raf/MAP kinase-ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular<lb/> signal-regulated (ERK) kinase pathway (also known as<lb/> the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] cascade)<lb/> [14], which stimulates cyclin D1 gene transcription and<lb/> leads to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb)<lb/> tumor suppressor protein. This phosphorylation inac-<lb/>tivates the capability of Rb to interact with the E2F<lb/> transcription factors, causing them to accumulate and<lb/> activate the transcription of a large number of genes<lb/> essential for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression<lb/> from G1 to S phase [15]. Therefore, it is believed that<lb/> PDGF has an essential role in the tissue response to<lb/> injury by activating the MAPK cascade in VSMCs,<lb/> thereby causing cellular proliferation, migration, and<lb/> differentiation and thus the formation of a neointimal<lb/> lesion.<lb/> Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a 46-<lb/>kDa dimeric peptide [16] that is essential for angiogen-<lb/>esis (sprouting of capillaries from preexisting vessels)<lb/> and vasculogenesis (endothelial cell differentiation)<lb/> [17, 18]. The biological effects of VEGF are mainly<lb/> regulated by two tyrosine kinase receptors, Flt-1 [19]<lb/> and Flk-1/KDR [20], the latter being important in cell<lb/> proliferation, antiapoptosis, and cell survival in endo-<lb/>thelial cells [16, 21, 22]. The angiogenic effects of<lb/> VEGF have been used clinically to stimulate collateral<lb/> artery formation in regions of tissue with vascular<lb/> deficits such as occurs with ischemic heart disease and<lb/> peripheral vascular disease [23, 24]. More recently, it<lb/> has been hypothesized that VEGF has additional vas-<lb/>cular protective properties that may be useful in the<lb/> treatment of cardiovascular occlusive diseases [25].<lb/> Specifically, it has been shown in a number of studies<lb/> that VEGF gene or protein infusion increases<lb/> re-endothelialization and therefore, it has been hy-<lb/>pothesized that as a consequence of this re-<lb/>endothelialization, neointimal hyperplasia is inhibited<lb/> [26 –30].<lb/> Evidence suggests that VEGF receptors, Flt-1 and<lb/> Flk-1/KDR, are present not only on endothelial cells<lb/> but are present on a number of other cell types [31–33].<lb/> Moreover, two independent groups have detected func-<lb/>tional VEGF receptors on VSMC that can induced mi-<lb/>gration but not proliferation [34,35]. However, the ef-<lb/>fect of VEGF on mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation<lb/> is unknown.<lb/> In this study, we show that VEGF directly inhibits<lb/> PDGF-BB-induced proliferation of VSMC using a<lb/> bromo deoxy uridine (BrdU) proliferation assay. Fur-<lb/>thermore, we show by western blotting immunoassay<lb/> that VEGF inhibits PDGF-BB-mediated phosphoryla-<lb/>tion of Rb and ERK 1/2 protein.<lb/> MATERIALS AND METHODS<lb/> Reagents<lb/> Human recombinant VEGF and PDGF-BB were obtained from<lb/> PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human aortic VSMCs, smooth muscle<lb/> basal media (SmBM), smooth muscle growth media (SmGM) contain-<lb/>ing 0.5 g/mL hEGF, 1 g/ml hFGF, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 50<lb/> g/mL amphotericin-B, 5 mg/mL insulin, and 5% fetal bovine serum,<lb/> 0.025% tryspin/0.01% EDTA solution, trypsin neutralizing solution,<lb/> and HEPES-buffered saline solution were all-obtained from Clonet-<lb/>ics Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD). The following monoclonal an-<lb/>tibodies were purchased: phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb)<lb/> (554136) from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA),<lb/> -smooth muscle actin (A-2547) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and<lb/> ERK2 (E-4) and pERK 1/2 (D-2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology<lb/> (Santa Cruz, CA). Supersignal Chemiluminescence kit and horserad-<lb/>ish peroxidase were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Protein<lb/> concentration assay solutions were purchased from Bio-Rad (Her-<lb/>cules, CA). Film was obtained from Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY).<lb/> Nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher and Schuell (Keene,<lb/> NH). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,<lb/> MO), unless otherwise stated.<lb/> Cell Culture<lb/> VSMCs were grown in SmGM containing 5% fetal bovine serum at<lb/> 37°C in 5% CO 2 and 95% ambient air. SmGM containing 5% fetal<lb/> bovine serum was used for proliferating cells and SmBM, which is<lb/> devoid of growth factors or cytokines was used for the purpose of<lb/> serum starvation. Culture medium was changed every 3 days.<lb/> Trypsin/EDTA was used with HEPES-buffered saline solution and<lb/> trypsin neutralizing solution to passage the cells. Cells were used at<lb/> passage number 3– 6. Cells were allowed to proliferate until they<lb/> reached 60 –70% confluency, at which point the SmGM was aspirated<lb/> and the media changed to SmBM to allow cell cycle synchronization.<lb/> Cells were serum-starved overnight (18 h) using SmBm and treated<lb/> the following morning. Treatment consisted of 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB<lb/> with the addition of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 ng/ml VEGF in a solution<lb/> of SmBM for a 24-h period.<lb/> BrdU Incorporation<lb/> Cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate at 3  10 5 cells/mL, serum-<lb/>starved, and treated with the solutions stated above. A BrdU cell<lb/> proliferation assay (QIA58; Oncogene Research Products, Boston,<lb/> MA) was used per manufacturer&apos;s instructions to detect BrdU incor-<lb/>poration into dividing cells. BrdU labeling was added to each well at<lb/> the time of treatment, therefore the cells were incubated with BrdU<lb/> label for a 24-h period to allow adequate cellular uptake before<lb/> analysis. A spectrometer was used for colorimetric detection of BrdU<lb/>

Two-hundred microliters of RIPA buffer (50<lb/> mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1%<lb/> Nonidet P-40) containing aprotinin (1 g/mL), leupeptin (1 g/mL),<lb/> 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmeth-<lb/>ylsulfonylfluoride was then added, and the cells were scraped off and<lb/> transferred into 1.5-mL microcentrifugation tubes. They were then<lb/> incubated on ice and vortexed for 20 s. After centrifugation at<lb/> 100,000 g at 4°C for 20 min, the supernatants were obtained. The<lb/> protein content of each cell lysate was measured using a standard<lb/> spectrophotometric protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad). Protein<lb/> samples were then diluted with RIPA buffer to equalize protein<lb/> concentrations in all samples (1 mg/mL).

			ng/mL (P  0.01; Fig. 3B). Results are reported as<lb/> mean  SD.<lb/> CONCLUSION<lb/> Previous studies have determined that VEGF has<lb/> vascular protective effects as well as a role in thera-<lb/>peutic angiogenesis. In a rat carotid balloon injury<lb/> model, delivery of intravenous VEGF protein or VEGF<lb/> gene transfer was shown to accelerate re-<lb/>endothelialization and attenuate neointimal hyperpla-<lb/>sia [26, 27]. Further experiments studying stent im-<lb/>plantation in rabbit iliac arteries have shown that<lb/> intravenous VEGF protein or gene transfer accelerated<lb/> re-endothelialization, decreased neointima formation,<lb/> and reduced mural thrombosis [28, 29]. There is also<lb/> evidence of reduction in rabbit vein graft intimal hy-<lb/>perplasia following topical VEGF administration [36].<lb/> However, this issue has been the subject of consider-<lb/>able debate, since, for instance, it has been reported<lb/> that intravenous VEGF protein infusion in dogs after<lb/> iliofemoral balloon denudation actually resulted in in-<lb/>creased neointimal hyperplasia and had no effect on<lb/> maximal collateral blood flow [37].

			other group of investigators found that administration<lb/> of VEGF by various techniques did not increase endo-<lb/>thelial cell regrowth post denudation of either the<lb/> aorta or the carotid arteries of rats and mice, but only<lb/> increased vascular permeability [38].<lb/> Despite the above controversy, a significant body of<lb/> evidence points to VEGF being able to promote re-<lb/>endothelialization and reduce neointimal hyperplasia<lb/> after balloon-induced catheter injury, stent implanta-<lb/>tion and after vein grafting. Asahari et al. have hypoth-<lb/>esized that the mechanism by which VEGF inhibits<lb/> neointimal hyperplasia is principally through its pro-<lb/>liferating action on endothelial cells leading to the<lb/> re-endothelialization of denuded arteries, and that this<lb/> re-endothelialization secondarily inhibits neointimal<lb/> hyperplasia [26]. However, in an experiment per-<lb/>formed using an extravascular silastic collar to induce<lb/> VSMC proliferation (without endothelial cell denuda-<lb/>tion) in rabbit carotid arteries, it was discovered that<lb/> soaking the collar with VEGF gene, and using the cuff<lb/> as a gene delivery reservoir significantly inhibited neo-<lb/>intimal VSMC hyperplasia [39]. This implies that<lb/> VEGF may have vascular protective effects indepen-<lb/>dent of its mitogenic action on endothelial cells.<lb/> Interestingly, Taniguchi et al. demonstrated that, in<lb/> a cell culture model using human uterine myometrial<lb/> cells, addition of VEGF-neutralizing antibody to<lb/> PDGF-BB stimulated cells resulted in a linear increase<lb/> in proliferation beyond plateau maximal concentra-<lb/>tions of PDGF-BB [40]. They hypothesized that VEGF<lb/> may negatively regulate the myometrial cell prolifera-<lb/>tion induced by PDGF-BB. In that particular study, the<lb/> investigators did not perform any further experiments<lb/> to elucidate the mechanism by which VEGF might be<lb/> suppressing PDGF-BB induced proliferation. Addition-<lb/>ally, Hu et al. reported that VEGF-2, which differs<lb/> from VEGF protein by one amino acid residue within<lb/> the signal peptide portion, inhibits PDGF-BB induced<lb/> human aortic cell proliferation. The authors also hy-<lb/>pothesized that VEGF-2 may have a regulatory action<lb/> on the vasculature [41].<lb/> Our experiments clearly demonstrate that VEGF<lb/> has a direct effect on mitogen-induced proliferation of<lb/> VSMC. PDGF was used as a known VSMC mitogen<lb/> because it has been shown in previous studies to play<lb/> an important role in the pathogenesis of the neointimal<lb/> lesion [9 –12]. Using the BrdU proliferation assay, we<lb/> have shown that when PDGF induces the proliferation<lb/> of VSMC, VEGF inhibits DNA synthesis in a dose-<lb/>dependent manner. Furthermore, western immuno-<lb/>assay reveals that the inhibition of proliferation is<lb/> paralleled by a dose-dependent decrease in Rb phos-<lb/>phorylation. This implies that the VSMCs are unable<lb/> to pass from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle and<lb/> thus were in cell cycle arrest. In addition, ERK phos-<lb/>phorylation was also inhibited in a dose-dependent<lb/> manner suggesting that VEGF has effects upstream<lb/> from ERK phosphorylation in the MAPK cascade. Fur-<lb/>ther studies are necessary to determine the exact point<lb/> of action of VEGF in the MAPK pathway, and whether<lb/> it acts through its own Flt-1 or Flk-1/KDR receptor or<lb/> whether it acts as a PDGF antagonist at the receptor<lb/> level. The latter may be a more likely mechanism be-<lb/>cause VEGF has a similar 3-D structure to PDGF-BB<lb/> and also has a related amino acid sequence [42]. Addi-<lb/>tional investigations are required to determine<lb/> whether VEGF induces apoptosis in VSMC. Apoptosis,<lb/> however, is unlikely to be the explanation for the de-<lb/>creased proliferation of VSMC to PDGF-BB in the pres-<lb/>ence of VEGF because there was no evidence of nonvi-<lb/>able or dead cells at any of the time points or treatment<lb/> arms, as evidenced by the trypan blue exclusion test.<lb/> However, this particular piece of data is a gross, but<lb/> inadequate test to rule cell death as a cause of the<lb/> observed phenomenon and will have to be confirmed by<lb/> detailed investigation into morphologic features of and<lb/> other markers of apoptosis.<lb/> In summary, we have demonstrated that VEGF may<lb/> have direct inhibitory effects on VSMC proliferation<lb/> and that this occurs in the absence of endothelial cells.<lb/> This occurs upstream of ERK in the MAPK pathway.<lb/> In addition to re-endothelialization, we believe that<lb/> this is another important vascular protective mecha-<lb/>nism of VEGF in modulating mitogen-induced VSMC<lb/> proliferation following vascular injury and in attenu-<lb/>ating the development of neointimal hyperplasia.<lb/> Moreover, VEGF may act as a negative feedback reg-<lb/>ulator of mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation. Fur-<lb/>ther investigation is necessary to better understand<lb/> the exact mechanism of action, so that, perhaps, new<lb/> insight may be gained into the interaction between<lb/> PDGF and VEGF and the role that each may play in a<lb/> regulatory response to arterial injury.<lb/> </body>
