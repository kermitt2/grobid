Email: myers@stats.ox.ac.uk <lb/> 1 <lb/> Abstract <lb/>During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair (synapse) and recombine, <lb/>enabling balanced segregation and generating genetic diversity. In many <lb/>vertebrates, recombination initiates with double-strand breaks (DSBs) within <lb/>hotspots where PRDM9 binds, and deposits H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. However, <lb/>no protein(s) recognising this unique combination of histone marks have yet been <lb/>identified. <lb/>We identified Zcwpw1, which possesses H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 <lb/>recognition domains, as highly co-expressed with Prdm9. Here, we show that <lb/>ZCWPW1 has co-evolved with PRDM9 and, in human cells, is strongly and <lb/>specifically recruited to PRDM9 binding sites, with higher affinity than sites <lb/>possessing H3K4me3 alone. Surprisingly, ZCWPW1 also recognizes CpG <lb/>dinucleotides, including within many Alu transposons. <lb/>Male Zcwpw1 homozygous knockout mice show completely normal DSB <lb/>positioning, but persistent DMC1 foci at many hotspots, particularly those more <lb/>strongly bound by PRDM9, severe DSB repair and synapsis defects, and <lb/>downstream sterility. Our findings suggest a model where ZCWPW1 recognition of <lb/>PRDM9-bound sites on either the homologous, or broken, chromosome is critical <lb/>for synapsis, and hence fertility. <lb/></front>

			<front>Graphical Abstract Legend <lb/>In humans and other species, recombination is initiated by double strand breaks at <lb/>sites bound by PRDM9. Upon binding, PRDM9 deposits the histone marks <lb/>H3K4me3 and H3K36me, but the functional importance of these marks has <lb/>remained unknown. Here, we show that PRDM9 recruits ZCWPW1, a reader of <lb/>both these marks, to its binding sites genome-wide. ZCWPW1 does not help <lb/>position the breaks themselves, but is essential for their downstream repair and <lb/>chromosome pairing, and ultimately meiotic success and fertility in mice. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Meiosis is a specialised cell division, producing haploid gametes essential for <lb/>reproduction. Uniquely during this process, homologous maternal and paternal <lb/>chromosomes pair and exchange DNA (recombine) before undergoing balanced <lb/>independent segregation. Alongside de novo mutations, this generates all genetic <lb/>diversity -providing a substrate on which natural selection can act. <lb/>In humans, mice, and likely many other vertebrates (Baker et al., 2017), the <lb/>locations at which recombination occurs is determined by the binding locations of <lb/>PRDM9, which recognises a specific sequence motif encoded by its zinc finger <lb/>array (Baudat et al., 2010; Myers et al., 2010; Parvanov et al., 2010). At these sites, <lb/>Spo11 catalyzes recombination-initiating double strand breaks (DSBs), a subset of <lb/>which are repaired by recombination with the homologous chromosome. The sister <lb/>chromatid can also provide a repair substrate, e.g. for DSBs on the X chromosome <lb/>in males, and there is evidence that this also occurs at some autosomal hotspots <lb/>(Allen and Latt, 1976; R. Li et al., 2019; Lu and Yu, 2015). <lb/>In Prdm9-null mice, DSBs form at promoter regions rich in H3K4me3 (Brick <lb/>et al., 2012), and fail to repair resulting in severe asynapsis, meiotic arrest at <lb/>pachytene, and sterility in both males and females on the B6 background (Hayashi <lb/>et al., 2005). We previously showed (Davies et al., 2016) that across DSB sites, <lb/>increased binding of PRDM9 to the homologous chromosome aids synapsis and <lb/>fertility in hybrid mice, implying an impact of binding downstream of DSB <lb/>positioning. Mice where most DSBs occur at sites where PRDM9 does not bind the <lb/>homologue show widespread asynapsis (Davies et al., 2016; Gregorova et al., <lb/>2018). More recently, we showed that binding of PRDM9 to the homologous <lb/>chromosome promotes repair of DSBs by homologue-templated recombination, <lb/>potentially by aiding homology search (R. Li et al., 2019). <lb/></body>

			<body>DSB sites are processed by resection, resulting in single-stranded DNA <lb/>(ssDNA) that becomes decorated with DMC1 (Hong et al., 2001; Neale and <lb/>Keeney, 2006; Sehorn et al., 2004). In WT mice, DMC1 foci start to appear in early <lb/>zygotene cells upon loading to the ssDNA ends of the DSBs created during <lb/>leptotene. From mid-zygotene to early pachytene, as part of the recombinational <lb/>repair process, DMC1 dissociates from the ssDNA and counts decrease until all <lb/>breaks (except those on the XY chromosomes) are repaired in late pachytene <lb/>(Moens et al., 2002). At DSB sites where the homologous chromosome is not <lb/>bound by PRDM9, DMC1 signal is strongly elevated (Davies et al., 2016), <lb/>suggesting delayed DSB repair, while fewer homologous recombination events <lb/>occur (Hinch et al., 2019; R. Li et al., 2019), suggesting that (eventual) DSB repair <lb/>may sometimes use a sister chromosome pathway. However, the underlying <lb/>mechanism(s) by which PRDM9 effectively contributes to DSB repair are not yet <lb/>known. <lb/>PRDM9 deposits both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 histone methylation <lb/>marks at the sites it binds, and this methyltransferase activity is essential for its <lb/>role in DSB positioning (Diagouraga et al., 2018; Powers et al., 2016). What reads <lb/>this unique combination of marks at recombination sites, however, is currently <lb/>unknown. Notably, outside of hotspots and the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) on <lb/>sex chromosomes, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 occur at largely nonoverlapping <lb/>locations (Powers et al., 2016), suggesting potentially highly specialised reader(s). <lb/>Indeed, in somatic cells H3K4me3 is deposited mainly at promoters, in particular <lb/>by the SET1 complex targeted by CXXC1/CFP1 and Wdr82 which binds Ser5 <lb/>phosphorylated polymerase II (Barski et al., 2007; Lee and Skalnik, 2008, 2005). <lb/>H3K36me3 is deposited by different methlytransferases, including SETD2 bound <lb/>to Ser2 phosphorylated (elongating) polymerase II, and is enriched at exon bound <lb/>nucleosomes, particularly for 3&apos; exons (reviewed in (McDaniel and Strahl, 2017; <lb/>Wagner and Carpenter, 2012)). H3K36me3 has multiple important roles, including <lb/></body>

			<body>in directing DNA methylation by recruiting DNMT3B, somatic DSB repair by <lb/>homologous recombination (Aymard et al., 2014; Carvalho et al., 2014; Pfister et <lb/>al., 2014), mismatch repair by recruiting MSH6 (Huang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2013), <lb/>and V(D)J recombination during lymphopoiesis (Ji et al., 2019). <lb/>Using single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse testis, we identified a set of <lb/>genes co-expressed in (pre)leptotene cells which are highly enriched for genes <lb/>involved in meiotic recombination (Jung et al., 2019). Zcwpw1, which ranks 3 rd in <lb/>this set after Prdm9 (2 nd ), is of unknown function but contains two recognised <lb/>protein domains: CW and PWWP, shown to individually bind H3K4me3 and <lb/>H3K36me3 respectively (F. He et al., 2010; Rona et al., 2016). This raises the <lb/>attractive possibility that ZCWPW1 might recognize and physically associate with <lb/>the same marks deposited by PRDM9 (Jung et al., 2019). <lb/>In humans, ZCWPW1 is specifically expressed in testis (Carithers et al., <lb/>2015; Uhlén et al., 2015) (Supplementary Figure 1). It is also one of 104 genes <lb/>specific to meiotic prophase in murine fetal ovary (Soh et al., 2015), further <lb/>suggesting a conserved meiotic function. This was confirmed by a recent study <lb/>showing that ZCWPW1 is required for male fertility, with ZCWPW1 hypothesised <lb/>to recruit the DSB machinery to hotspot sites (M. Li et al., 2019). Here, we show <lb/>that ZCWPW1 co-evolves with PRDM9, and is recruited to recombination hotspots <lb/>by the combination of histone marks deposited by PRDM9. However, ZCWPW1 is <lb/>not required for the positioning of DSBs at PRDM9-bound sites, which occurs <lb/>normally in ZCWPW1-null mice. Instead, ZCWPW1 is required for proper inter-<lb/>homologue interactions: synapsis and the repair of DSBs. In ZCWPW1-null mice, <lb/>DMC1 signals show strong perturbations, with signals at autosomal hotspots <lb/>resembling those on the X-chromosome, which does not have a homologue. Thus, <lb/>ZCWPW1 represents the first protein directly positioned by PRDM9 binding, but <lb/>impacting homologous DSB repair. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>ZCWPW1 co-evolves with PRDM9 <lb/>Based on publicly available databases, we identified likely ZCWPW1 orthologues <lb/>in 167 species in total, aligned each to the human reference ZCWPW1 protein, and <lb/>compared against a previous analysis of PRDM9 (Baker et al., 2017). The <lb/>alignment reveals the regions containing the CW and PWWP domains to be the <lb/>most conserved among species (Figure 1), while other parts of the protein appear <lb/>to have been lost in some species. In addition, there is a region of moderate <lb/>conservation downstream of the PWWP domain, not overlapping any known <lb/>domain. Notably, an SYCP1 (SCP1) domain is annotated in the mouse protein <lb/>only, which although only suggestive, is interesting given that SYCP1 physically <lb/>connects homologous chromosomes in meiosis. In addition, protein threading <lb/>suggests that the C terminal end of ZCWPW1 may contain a methyl-CpG binding <lb/>domain (Methods, (Lobley et al., 2009). <lb/>Because of incomplete available DNA and protein sequences, we are <lb/>almost certain to miss some species where ZCWPW1 is present, and similarly it is <lb/>challenging to identify PRDM9 orthologues (Baker et al., 2017). Despite this, we <lb/>see extremely high overlap between PRDM9 and ZCWPW1 occurrence. All <lb/>identified ZCWPW1 orthologues are in vertebrates, similar to identified PRDM9 <lb/>orthologues (Baker et al., 2017). 99 of 167 (149) species with ZCWPW1 (PRDM9) <lb/>respectively have the other protein; an even higher fraction of species have a close <lb/>relative with an identified orthologue: 131 species with ZCWPW1 are in a family <lb/>possessing PRDM9. Only 8 species possess ZCWPW1 but are in an order with no <lb/>identified species possessing PRDM9: three amphibians including Xenopus frogs, <lb/>and five placental mammals. Given widespread conservation of PRDM9 among <lb/>mammals other than canids (Baker et al., 2017), these five might plausibly <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>represent false negatives. Thus, ZCWPW1 appears to mainly occur in species, <lb/>and even more clearly in groups of species, possessing PRDM9. <lb/>We identified ZCWPW1 orthologues across the full spectrum of vertebrates <lb/>possessing PRDM9, including jawless, cartilaginous and bony fish, coelacanths, <lb/>turtles, snakes and lizards, and mammals. Previous work (Baker et al., 2017) has <lb/>identified at least 6 independent complete PRDM9 loss events; in birds and <lb/>crocodiles; in three distinct groups of teleost fish (although these fish possess a <lb/>PRDM9 &quot;beta&quot; orthologue with mutations in key catalytic amino acids within the <lb/>SET domain); in canids; and tentatively, in amphibians. The first four losses appear <lb/>to have been completely mirrored by corresponding ZCWPW1 losses, with no <lb/>species previously studied by Baker et al. in these groups possessing a ZCWPW1 <lb/>orthologue. For the latter two, we did find potential orthologues (e.g. in canids), but <lb/>with mutations at positions in ZCWPW1 that are conserved among all PRDM9-<lb/>SET-possessing species (Methods). Thus, there has been similar (co)evolution of <lb/>presence/absence of ZCWPW1 and PRDM9. <lb/>We observe a greater number of species -28 -possessing PRDM9 <lb/>orthologues but having no relative closer than their class possessing an identified <lb/>ZCWPW1 orthologue. All of these are bony fish. Strikingly, 24 of these 28 <lb/>orthologues possess one or more mutations in their SET domain (Supplementary <lb/>Table 1), predicted to disrupt H3K4me3 and/or H3K36me3 deposition. In strong <lb/>contrast, 94% of PRDM9-containing species with non-mutant SET domains have <lb/>a closer relative possessing ZCWPW1 (odds ratio=90; indicative p&lt;10 -15 by FET, <lb/>though we note these observations are not all independent). This implies that <lb/>ZCWPW1 is most often lost, whenever mutations occur in the SET domain of <lb/>PRDM9. Interestingly, PRDM9-containing species with non-mutant SET domains <lb/>are near-identical to those also possessing SSXRD domains, and SSXRD has <lb/>been reported as essential for PRDM9&apos;s H3K4me3 methyltransferase activity at <lb/>hotspots ex vivo (Thibault-Sennett et al., 2018). However, other domains of <lb/></body>

			<body>PRDM9 (KRAB, and the zinc finger array) have been lost across multiple species, <lb/>and it is hypothesized PRDM9 does not position recombination in these species <lb/>(Baker et al., 2017). Nonetheless, they mainly retain ZCWPW1 (Supplementary <lb/>Table 1). In conclusion, among vertebrates at least, it appears the set of species <lb/>with ZCWPW1 is extremely similar to those species possessing PRDM9 with both <lb/>an intact SET domain, and an SSXRD domain, with considerable evidence of co-<lb/>evolution of gain/loss events for each protein. We note that this pattern is precisely <lb/>what would be expected a priori, if ZCWPW1&apos;s main function involves recognition <lb/>of the histone modifications catalysed by PRDM9-SET during early meiosis, as <lb/>predicted from functional considerations. <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>In testes from wild-type (WT) mice, we observe a dynamic localisation of ZCWPW1 <lb/>protein (Figure 2), similar but non-identical to that reported in a recent study (M. Li <lb/>et al., 2019). ZCWPW1 shows a strong, punctate nuclear staining excluding the <lb/>pericentromeric regions (clustered into chromocenters brightly stained with DAPI) <lb/>in zygotene and early pachytene cells; we detected transcript expression in earlier <lb/>pre-leptotene to leptotene cells (Jung et al., 2019). In pachytene cells, ZCWPW1 <lb/>expression drops, with the protein now mainly localised in the XY body and as <lb/>bright foci at the ends of the synaptonemal complex labelled by SYCP3, not <lb/>previously observed using an antibody raised against a 174 base-pair (bp) C-<lb/>terminal region of the protein (M. Li et al., 2019). By diplotene, little expression is <lb/>visible. Using FISH to label telomeric ends of chromosomes, we established that <lb/>these discrete foci of ZCWPW1 are located at subtelomeric regions <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 3). <lb/>We next studied mice from a constitutive Zcwpw1 KO line (Methods), <lb/>carrying a ~1.5kb frameshift deletion encompassing exons 5 to 7 upstream of the <lb/>CW domain, creating a premature stop codon resulting in the production and <lb/>predicted degradation (by RNA-mediated decay) of a short 492bp (vs 1893bp for <lb/>WT) transcript (Figure 3A). Confirming this, ZCWPW1 expression was completely <lb/>absent in testis chromosome spreads from Zcwpw1 -/-mice, in zygotene cells <lb/>(Figure 3B) and all other meiotic stages of prophase I where expression is <lb/>detected in WT mice (Supplementary Figure 4). Confirming recent findings in a <lb/>different Zcwpw1 -/-mouse (M. Li et al., 2019), we observed no overt fertility <lb/>phenotype in either sex in the heterozygous Zcwpw1 +/-mice (data not shown). <lb/>However Zcwpw1 -/-male mice were sterile with complete azoospermia and <lb/>reduced testis size (Figure 3B,D), while female mice retained fertility until around <lb/>7-8 months of age (Supplementary Table 2), and otherwise both sexes develop <lb/>normally.

			<body>Each of these properties resembles observations in the Prdm9 -/-mutant, and so <lb/>we compared to this mutant. In our Zcwpw1 -/-male mice, &gt;98% of pachytene cells <lb/>failed to properly synapse at least one pair of chromosomes (Figure 3B, E), similar <lb/>to Prdm9 -/-males. However, the nature of the synaptic defects observed differed <lb/>(Supplementary Table 4). In the Prdm9 -/-mutant, 63.2% of the pseudopachytene <lb/>cells showed mispairing of non-homologous chromosomes in a typical branched <lb/>structure (referred to as &quot;tangled&quot;, Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, we only <lb/>observed 24.8% of Zcwpw1 -/-pseudopachytene cells with this type of error, while <lb/>the majority (74.5%) of cells contained multiple bundles of HORMAD2-positive <lb/>unsynapsed chromosomes, which resemble the XY body and may merge with the <lb/>sex chromosomes (thus referred to as &quot;multibodies&quot;, Supplementary Figure 5). <lb/>These results imply that the Prdm9 -/-mutant often mispairs chromosomes, while <lb/>Zcwpw1 -/-spermatocytes mainly fail to pair a subset of chromosomes at all. The <lb/>expression levels and staining pattern of ZCWPW1 were not visibly altered in testis <lb/>nuclear spreads from Prdm9 -/-mice (data not shown). <lb/>Comparing levels of DMC1 foci as a proxy for DSB repair, or a potential <lb/>cause for the asynapsis in Zcwpw1 -/-males, in both Zcwpw1 -/-and Prdm9 -/-mice <lb/>foci count was significantly elevated from early zygotene onwards, indicating <lb/>delayed repair of DSBs (Figure 4). However, we observed a wider spread for <lb/>Zcwpw1 -/-males. A similar increase was observed at pachytene stage in the levels <lb/>of RAD51 (Supplementary Figure 6), another ssDNA-binding protein which <lb/>functions in concert with DMC1, with the large majority of RAD51 and DMC1 foci <lb/>co-localizing (Brown et al., 2015; Tarsounas et al., 1999). In contrast, there was no <lb/>difference in the levels of RPA2 (Supplementary Figure 7). In Zcwpw1 -/-males, <lb/>like in the Prdm9 -/-mutant, DSBs form and recruit RPA2, RAD51 and DMC1 in <lb/>similar numbers (M. Li et al., 2019), but fail to repair efficiently, accompanied by <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>asynapsis and meiotic arrest at pseudo-pachytene. Indeed, we observe late <lb/>unrepaired DMC1 foci mainly on asynapsed chromosomes (Supplementary <lb/>Figure 8). <lb/>We also performed analyses of which chromosomes fail to synapse. FISH <lb/>analysis revealed that chromosomes 18 and 19 are most often among these <lb/>asynapsed chromosomes, while grouping of chromosomes based on their size <lb/>revealed some asynapsis of all chromosomes, but at higher levels for shorter <lb/>chromosomes (Supplementary Figure 9). This is similar to results observed for <lb/>infertile hybrid male mice (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013), whose asynapsis is driven <lb/>by lack of binding to the homologous chromosome by PRDM9 (Davies et al., 2016). <lb/>ZCWPW1 is recruited to PRDM9 binding sites in an allele-specific manner <lb/>We previously studied the binding properties of human PRDM9 and established a <lb/>genome-wide map in transfected human mitotic (HEK293T) cells by ChIP-seq <lb/>(Altemose et al., 2017), observing binding to the majority of human meiotic <lb/>recombination hotspots. Based on the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 <lb/>recognition domains in ZCWPW1, we hypothesized that it would be recruited to <lb/>PRDM9-bound genomic sites, where these marks are deposited upon binding in <lb/>HEK293T cells (Altemose et al., 2017). <lb/>To test this, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with full-length human HA-tagged <lb/>ZCWPW1 and either no other protein, or full-length PRDM9 alleles carrying the <lb/>human or chimpanzee ZF-array, as studied previously (Altemose et al., 2017), and <lb/>then performed ChIP-seq against the ZCWPW1 tag. Confirming the recruitment <lb/>hypothesis, in the presence of human PRDM9 and compared to cells lacking <lb/>human PRDM9, ZCWPW1 shows a strong enrichment at human PRDM9 binding <lb/>sites (Figure 5A, B). Notably, even without PRDM9 we observed sequence-<lb/>specific binding of ZCWPW1 to many sites in the genome (Figure 5C and <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>Supplementary Figure 10). However, upon transfection, 91% (98%) of the <lb/>strongest 10,132 (3,016) peaks are PRDM9 binding sites (cf. 7% expected overlap <lb/>with randomised peaks), so PRDM9 is able to strongly reprogram ZCWPW1 <lb/>binding, suggesting that non-PRDM9 peaks are bound more weakly. Because our <lb/>transfection has &lt;100% efficiency (Supplementary Figure 11), some cells <lb/>containing ZCWPW1 will not possess PRDM9, and so it is possible that an even <lb/>greater fraction of ZCWPW1 is redirected to PRDM9 binding sites in cells where <lb/>both proteins are present. <lb/>Importantly, when co-transfecting with a modified version of PRDM9 in <lb/>which the zinc finger array is replaced with that from chimp (which binds different <lb/>locations in the genome (Altemose et al., 2017)), we find that the enrichment at <lb/>human binding sites disappears, but instead ZCWPW1 is enriched at chimp <lb/>PRDM9 binding sites (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 12). This <lb/>perturbation experiment provides strong evidence that PRDM9 causes recruitment <lb/>of ZCWPW1 (as opposed to for example independent recruitment of both proteins). <lb/>Notably, the strength of binding of ZCWPW1 at these sites provides a better <lb/>predictor of DSB formation (DMC1 sites) than does PRDM9 binding strength itself <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 13): although we show (see below) that ZCWPW1 is not <lb/>directly involved in DSB positioning, this might suggest involvement of similar <lb/>features to those it recognizes, in recruiting DSBs. <lb/></body>

Heatmaps: log-fold change of target (indicated in column titles, <lb/>Methods) vs input, for various labeled target proteins, ordered by human PRDM9. <lb/>ZCWPW1, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 each become enriched at human PRDM9 <lb/>sites, following (co-)transfection with human PRDM9. (C) ChIP-seq data and <lb/>annotation in a genome plot illustrate the behaviour of ZCWPW1 and other factors. <lb/>ChIP-seq tracks show fragment coverage. Tracks where PRDM9 is present are <lb/>labelled &quot;w/ PRDM9&quot;, and below corresponding tracks with out PRDM9. ZCWPW1 <lb/>binds to Alus, CpG islands and other CpG-rich sequences even in the absence of <lb/>PRDM9. On addition of PRDM9, ZCWPW1 becomes strongly enriched at PRDM9 <lb/>binding locations (center left peak within DIO1). <lb/>We tested whether this recruitment might be mediated by the dual histone <lb/>modifications H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. Consistent with this idea, ZCWPW1 <lb/>binding is positively associated with levels of both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks <lb/>(Supplementary Figures 14 and 15). We examined transcription start sites, which <lb/>possess H3K4me3 at high levels, but lack H3K36me3, observing some ZCWPW1 <lb/>signal at these sites, but with a uniformly lower mean ZCWPW1 enrichment <lb/>compared to those with evidence of PRDM9 binding (and hence both histone <lb/>marks) (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 16). Although it is not possible to <lb/>measure H3K4me3 presence/absence in individual cells in our system, even the <lb/>most weakly bound PRDM9 sites -which must therefore possess H3K4me3 in <lb/>only a fraction of cells -show stronger ZCWPW1 enrichment than the strongest <lb/>promoters, which are likely to have near 100% H3K4me3 marking, and possess <lb/>&gt;2-fold more H3K4me3 than even the strongest PRDM9 binding sites. We <lb/></body>

			<body>conclude that H3K4me3 alone endows only relatively weak binding, while PRDM9 <lb/>is therefore able to recruit ZCWPW1 with a much greater efficiency than sites <lb/>marked by H3K4me3 alone, suggesting that both histone modifications might aid <lb/>efficient binding. <lb/>Figure 6. PRDM9 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) is a stronger recruiter of <lb/>ZCWPW1 than promoters (H3K4me3 only). H3K4me3 and ZCWPW1 were force <lb/>called in 100bp windows. Each subset is defined as indicated in the legend with <lb/>the additional constraint of requiring input fragment coverage &gt;5 for ZCWPW1 and <lb/>&gt;15 for H3K4me3.

			<body>black horizontal line highlights that the mean enrichment of the highest bin for <lb/>promoters is similar to that of the lowest bin for PRDM9 bound sites. <lb/>DSBs occur at their normal locations in Zcwpw1 -/-mice but show altered <lb/>DMC1 persistence <lb/>Previous work has shown that Prdm9 -/-mice use a new set of DSB hotspots, <lb/>localising at CpG islands and/or promoter regions (Brick et al., 2012). Given that <lb/>PRDM9 recruits ZCWPW1, one possible function of ZCWPW1 may be that, in turn, <lb/>it recruits the DSB machinery and hence forms part of the causal chain in normal <lb/>positioning of DSBs at PRDM9-specified hotspots. Alternatively, the Zcwpw1 -/-<lb/>mutant phenotypes we observe might reflect a more downstream role. To <lb/>distinguish these hypotheses, we gathered data on DSB positioning and repair <lb/>dynamics genome-wide, by carrying out single stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequencing <lb/>(SSDS) by ChIP-seq against DMC1 (Khil et al., 2012). <lb/>In the Zcwpw1 -/-mutant, we observed normal localisation of DMC1 at the <lb/>expected B6 hotspots for this background, with no activity at Prdm9 -/-hotspots <lb/>(Figure 7A). Moreover, individual wild-type hotspots appear always to be active in <lb/>the Zcwpw1 -/-mutant (Figure 7C): we only fail to see evidence of DMC1 signal in <lb/>a subset of the weakest hotspots, where we are likely to lack statistical power <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 17). Thus DSBs occur in unchanged hotspot regions in <lb/>Zcwpw1 -/-males. To check if they occur at the same locations within hotspot <lb/>regions, we leveraged data for SPO11-mapped DSB sites (Lange et al., 2016). <lb/>Specifically, we identified three sets of hotspots whose respective mapped breaks <lb/>occur mainly upstream, central, or downstream of the PRDM9 binding site <lb/>(Methods), and compared their DMC1 ChIP-Seq signal profiles, as well as their <lb/>SPO11 signals (Supplementary Figure 18). This revealed that in the Zcwpw1 -/-<lb/>males, as in the wild-type, DMC1 signals, though broader, mirror this break <lb/></body>

			<body>positioning. Therefore, ZCWPW1 is not required to specify hotspot locations, and <lb/>neither does it strongly influence where DSBs occur within hotspots. <lb/>One perhaps important difference between the Zcwpw1 -/-and wild-type <lb/>DMC1 profiles is that the latter signal grows slightly (up to ~200bp) wider in <lb/>hotspots with increasing PRDM9-induced H3K4me3 (Figure 7B), while this effect <lb/>is absent in the Zcwpw1 -/-case. This might be explained by small differences in <lb/>chromatin accessibility subtly impacting SPO11 locations, DNA end resection <lb/>which generates the 3&apos; ssDNA tail to which DMC1 binds, or downstream <lb/>processing differences altering DMC1 span in the mutant mice. <lb/></body>

Relationship between <lb/>SPO11-oligos (measuring the number of DSBs) vs DMC1 (a measure of the <lb/>number and persistence of DSBs) at each B6 hotspot for WT and Zcwpw1 -/-. Green <lb/>line is y=x for reference. <lb/>Despite very similar DSB locations, we saw much greater, and systematic, <lb/>differences in the strength of the DMC1 signal at individual hotspots. As previously <lb/>(Davies et al., 2016; Khil et al., 2012), we note that observed average DMC1 signal <lb/>strength at a hotspot reflects the product of the frequency at which DSBs occur <lb/>there, and the average length of time DMC1 remains bound to the ssDNA repair <lb/>intermediate, with the latter reflecting DSB processing/repair time. In contrast, <lb/>available SPO11 ChIP-Seq data (Lange et al., 2016) reflect mainly the former, the <lb/>frequency of DSBs. We therefore compared DMC1 and SPO11 signal strength at <lb/>each autosomal and X-chromosome hotspot, in WT and Zcwpw1 -/-mice. In WT <lb/>mice (as seen previously in other mice (Davies et al., 2016) including, albeit <lb/>somewhat more weakly, even sterile hybrids) the non-PAR X-chromosome shows <lb/>a very strong elevation of DMC1 signal strength, reflecting the persistent DMC1 <lb/>foci on this chromosome also visible using microscopy, at DSB sites that eventually <lb/>repair using the sister chromatid. Moreover, in WT mice hotspot heat (with hotter <lb/>hotspots having stronger H3K4me3 signal also) shows a sub-linear relationship <lb/>between SPO11 and DMC1. This is thought to reflect a wider phenomenon of <lb/>faster DSB repair occurring within those hotspots whose homologue is more <lb/>strongly bound by PRDM9, i.e. those hotspots with a stronger H3K4me3 signal in <lb/>the WT mouse (Davies et al., 2016; Hinch et al., 2019; R. Li et al., 2019). The X-<lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>chromosome DMC1 elevation is in a sense an extreme case of slower repair of <lb/>DSBs whose homologue is not PRDM9-bound, because no homologue exists in <lb/>this case. <lb/>However, we see a striking departure in the Zcwpw1 -/-mouse, where the <lb/>X-chromosome behaves similarly to the autosomes in terms of DMC1 vs. SPO11 <lb/>signal strength (Figure 7C). Moreover, we also see a simple linear relationship <lb/>between DMC1 and SPO11 binding in this mouse. These data imply the <lb/>relationship between DMC1 removal and PRDM9 binding is eliminated in this <lb/>mouse, so PRDM9 (whether because ZCWPW1 directly aids the process, or <lb/>indirectly) appears unable to &quot;assist&quot; in homology search in this mouse. Indeed, <lb/>the data imply a widespread perturbation of DSB repair in this mouse, with <lb/>autosomal DMC1 foci persisting as long as those on the X-chromosome. In the <lb/>previously studied Hop2 -/-mouse (Khil et al., 2012; Petukhova et al., 2003; <lb/>Smagulova et al., 2011), we identified a very similar pattern (Supplementary <lb/>Figure 19): in this mouse, DMC1 is loaded onto ssDNA, but DSBs are not repaired <lb/>at all, indicating that DSB repair pathways in Zcwpw1 -/-mice are profoundly altered. <lb/>These results are consistent with, and extend, our microscopy observations <lb/>(Figure 4) that many DSBs persist in the Zcwpw1 -/-mouse, and some may never <lb/>repair. We are unable to say whether DSB repair involves the homologue or not in <lb/>this mouse, but the partial synapsis we observe suggests some repair does likely <lb/>occur. To further understand DMC1 persistence at individual hotspots, we <lb/>estimated the relative DMC1 heat of 9,318 autosomal hotspots in the Zcwpw1 -/-<lb/>mouse, compared to the WT mouse (Methods). Via linear regression, by far the <lb/>best individual predictor of this ratio among H3K4me3, WT DMC1, and SPO11 was <lb/>the level of H3K4me3 (r=0.55, p&lt;10 -15 ; Supplementary Figure 20, while r=0.57 <lb/>when using all 3 predictors together). The average DMC1 ratio changes around 9-<lb/>fold from the most weakly to the most strongly H3K4me3-marked hotspots. <lb/>Therefore, if DMC1 signal changes are indeed explained by slower DSB <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>processing in the Zcwpw1 -/-mouse at hotspots bound strongly by PRDM9, then <lb/>this implies a very strong effect. Whatever the cause, the overall strong correlation <lb/>implies perturbation of DMC1 behaviour is widespread, rather than impacting any <lb/>small subset of hotspots. Moreover, it appears to be mainly controlled by local <lb/>levels of PRDM9 histone modification, in keeping with the evidence that ZCWPW1 <lb/>recognizes this mark at PRDM9-bound sites, on either the broken or (identical) <lb/>homologous chromosome. <lb/>ZCWPW1 binds CpG dinucleotides <lb/>In addition to the strong PRDM9-dependent ZCWPW1 peaks described earlier, <lb/>there are many locations in HEK293T cells at which ZCWPW1 binds, typically more <lb/>weakly, and independently of PRDM9. Indeed, we identified over 800,000 <lb/>ZCWPW1 peaks. Surprisingly, a large proportion of these binding sites overlap Alu <lb/>repeats (Figure 8A and Supplementary Figure 21) (of which there are 1.1 million <lb/>in the human genome (Deininger, 2011)). The weakest ZCWPW1 peaks overlap <lb/>Alus most frequently, whilst the strongest peaks are depleted of Alus relative to <lb/>chance overlap (Figure 8A). <lb/></body>

ZCWPW1 peaks are enriched in <lb/>CpGs compared to random peak locations. &apos;Meth&apos;, methylated; &apos;UnMeth&apos;, <lb/>unmethylated; NA, not applicable. <lb/>Because Alus are rich in CpGs (containing &gt;23% of human CpG dinucleotides, <lb/>with deamination depleting CpGs in older Alus (Luo et al., 2014)), we tested if <lb/>binding correlates with CpG presence/absence. Indeed, the binding of ZCWPW1 <lb/>to Alus depends on the presence of CpGs, which are mainly methylated <lb/>(Gaysinskaya et al., 2018): Alus with no CpGs were bound at a rate lower than by <lb/>chance, but almost all Alus containing 10-20 CpGs are bound (Figure 8B). This <lb/>dependence is not Alu-specific: even outside genomic repeats, 300-bp regions with <lb/>zero CpGs have negligible probability of overlapping a ZCWPW1 binding site, while <lb/>the overlap probability rises to &gt;50% for regions containing 10 or more CpGs, <lb/>suggesting CpGs are essential for PRDM9-independent ZCWPW1 binding (Figure <lb/>8C,D and Supplementary Figure 22). ZCWPW1 appears to have greater affinity <lb/>for methylated CpG pairs, but retains some affinity even for non-methylated <lb/>regions. This binding mode was unexpected a priori, and does not appear to be <lb/>easily explained by patterns of H3K4me3/H3K36me3 in the genome, which do not <lb/>concentrate as strongly in these regions. <lb/></body>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>Here we exploited previous work on single-cell transcript profiling of mouse testis, <lb/>which has established spatio-temporal (and likely functional) components of co-<lb/>expressed genes (Jung et al., 2019), to identify co-factors relevant to PRDM9 <lb/>function in specification of recombination hotspots and DSB repair during meiosis. <lb/>We show that the histone methylation reader ZCWPW1, which is both highly co-<lb/>expressed and co-evolving with PRDM9, is recruited by PRDM9 to its binding sites, <lb/>likely mediated through the recognition of the dual H3K4me3-H3K36me3 histone <lb/>mark PRDM9 deposits. <lb/>While we find co-evolution of ZCWPW1 with PRDM9, consistent with <lb/>proteins functioning in the same pathway, this appears to depend on particular <lb/>domains. ZCWPW1 shows weaker conservation among species outside the CW <lb/>and PWWP domains, suggesting these are of high importance, and co-occurs with <lb/>PRDM9 in species where the latter possesses a SET domain predicted to retain <lb/>catalytic activity for H3K4me3/H3K36me3, which the domains of ZCWPW1 are <lb/>predicted to recognise, strongly suggesting a partnership totally dependent on this <lb/>recognition. This co-occurrence can persist, even in species where PRDM9 is not <lb/>believed to position DSBs, suggesting the co-operation between these proteins <lb/>does not completely depend on this aspect of PRDM9&apos;s function. Interestingly, <lb/>such a SET domain of PRDM9 mainly occurs when PRDM9 possesses a SSXRD <lb/>domain, which in other proteins (Banito et al., 2018) recruits CXXC2 which binds <lb/>to CpG islands -whether this connects to our observation of a potential CpG-<lb/>binding domain in ZCWPW1, and CpG-binding behaviour ex-vivo, remains to be <lb/>explored. <lb/>Others have recently reported phenotyping of Zcwpw1 -/-mice (M. Li et al., <lb/>2019), and although our KO is different, we observe similar patterns of infertility in <lb/>males, and results consistent with gradual fertility decline in females, towards <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>sterility from 8 months onwards. Why females deficient for ZCWPW1 are (at least <lb/>initially) fertile is unknown, but resembles sexual dimorphism in loss-of-function <lb/>mutants for other meiotic genes involved in homologous recombination, where <lb/>females exhibit a milder fertility phenotype (Cahoon and Libuda, 2019; Morelli and <lb/>Cohen, 2005; Zhang et al., 2019). However we observe a distinct intracellular <lb/>localisation of ZCWPW1 from that reported by (M. Li et al., 2019): while we also <lb/>detect ZCWPW1 as a diffuse nuclear signal across the nucleus (though excluding <lb/>the chromocenters) and localisation to the XY body in pachytene, we see an <lb/>additional signal in mid-pachytene to diplotene cells at the ends of the <lb/>synaptonemal complex. This might reflect the specificity of our polyclonal antibody, <lb/>which is raised against the full-length mouse protein vs a monoclonal antibody <lb/>raised against a C-terminal region, hence recognising a wider spectrum of <lb/>ZCWPW1. Given that the Zcwpw1 -/-mouse arrests in early pachytene, it is not <lb/>possible to test later stages, so a caveat is that we cannot completely exclude off-<lb/>target antibody recognition. If accurate, the late-stage localisation of ZCWPW1 at <lb/>subtelomeric regions resembles other proteins (Speedy A, CDK2, TFR1, SUN1, <lb/>TERB1/2, MAJIN, and KASH), which form a complex tethering the telomeres to <lb/>the nuclear envelope to facilitate chromosome movement and pairing -essential <lb/>for synapsis and fertility (Ashley et al., 2001; Ding et al., 2007; Horn et al., 2013; <lb/>Shibuya et al., 2014; Tu et al., 2017). However, no evidence of impaired telomeric <lb/>attachment was reported in the other Zcwpw1 -/-, based on normal localisation of <lb/>TRF1 (M. Li et al., 2019). <lb/>We find, using an ex vivo system, that ZCWPW1 is strongly recruited to <lb/>PRDM9-bound sites, in an allele-specific manner, dependent on the level of <lb/>H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that PRDM9 deposits, and most likely due to recognition <lb/>of these marks by the CW and PWWP domains of ZCWPW1. Li and colleagues <lb/>(M. Li et al., 2019) showed co-immunoprecipitation of H3K4me3 with ZCWPW1, <lb/>but our results imply that PRDM9 recruits ZCWPW1 much more strongly than <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>H3K4me3 alone, further suggesting that the combination of histone marks is key <lb/>for ZCWPW1&apos;s recognition of PRDM9 sites. Indeed in cells with PRDM9, the <lb/>strongest ZCWPW1 binding sites are almost all PRDM9-bound sites. <lb/>Although it has been suggested that ZCWPW1 might recruit the DSB <lb/>machinery (M. Li et al., 2019; Spruce et al., 2019), our data imply DSB formation <lb/>and positioning are largely unaffected by loss of ZCWPW1 and occur at PRDM9-<lb/>bound hotspots. Moreover DMC1, RAD51 and RPA2 loading also appear normal <lb/>(Figure 7A and (M. Li et al., 2019)), but asynapsis and failure to remove DMC1 <lb/>imply a profound downstream impact. Indeed most hotspots show perturbed DMC1 <lb/>heats consistent with DSB repair delays proportional to their cis H3K4me3 levels, <lb/>i.e. driven by expected WT ZCWPW1 recruitment levels at each hotspot <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 15). ZCWPW1 therefore offers a (thus far) unique protein, <lb/>linking PRDM9 binding with its downstream functions (Davies et al., 2016; Hinch <lb/>et al., 2019; R. Li et al., 2019) in aiding rapid DSB processing/repair at hotspots <lb/>whose homologue is bound by PRDM9. <lb/>PRDM9 is thought to aid homology search/chromosome pairing by such <lb/>binding to the homologous chromosome, and hybrids where hotspots are highly <lb/>&quot;asymmetric&quot; (i.e. the homologues are not bound at the sites where DSBs occur, <lb/>due to evolutionary hotspot erosion) show multiple features identical to Zcwpw1 -/-<lb/>mice. These include asynapsis (particularly of shorter chromosomes with fewer <lb/>DSBs), persistent DMC1 foci (at the asymmetric hotspots), and complete sterility <lb/>in males only. In Zcwpw1 -/-mice, we infer that the level of PRDM9 binding to the <lb/>homologue now makes no difference to DSB persistence, so these mice generally <lb/>behave exactly as if all hotspots are completely asymmetric. Thus, a parsimonious <lb/>explanation of our findings is that ZCWPW1 functions by attaching to PRDM9-<lb/>bound sites, so as to recognize the homologous chromosome at DSB sites. This <lb/>might e.g. lead to their recruitment to the chromosomal axis (where DMC1 foci are <lb/>found), for potential use as the homologous repair template in DSB repair, perhaps <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>mediated by the SCP-1-like domain identified in some orthologous copies. Given <lb/>we observe ZCWPW1 throughout the nucleus in early meiosis, such recruitment <lb/>would likely be transient in nature. Alternatively, ZCWPW1&apos;s part in mediating <lb/>PRDM9&apos;s downstream roles might also depend (or even, depend only) on it binding <lb/>the chromosome on which DSBs occur. <lb/>Given that we still observe some synapsis, similar to Prdm9 -/-mice, we <lb/>suggest that a &quot;back-up&quot; mechanism, which is independent of PRDM9 binding <lb/>level, is acting to attempt homology search/chromosome pairing in Zcwpw1 -/-mice. <lb/>Some such mechanism is necessary, to repair DSBs happening within a subset of <lb/>hotspots that are asymmetric due to naturally occurring variation (as seen in e.g. <lb/>humans and heterozygous mice). If our observed &gt;9-fold changes in relative DMC1 <lb/>levels for strongly vs. weakly bound hotspots purely reflect increased DMC1 <lb/>persistence, it might be this mechanism is greatly slower than the PRDM9-<lb/>dependent pathway for wild-type mice. In turn, this could explain many -or all -of <lb/>the downstream phenotypes in these mice, as consequences of delayed homology <lb/>search. <lb/>The simplest explanation of our observation that ZCWPW1 binds in a CpG <lb/>dependent manner ex vivo is that these sites might be directly bound by a methyl-<lb/>CpG binding domain (MBD) putatively observed in the human, mouse, and <lb/>coelacanth Zcwpw1, among others. Alternatively, recruitment might be indirect, <lb/>with ZCWPW1 forming a complex with an MBD containing protein, e.g. SETDB1 <lb/>which is expressed in HEK293 cells, co-expressed with ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 <lb/>(Jung et al., 2019; Schultz et al., 2002), and interacts with several other identified <lb/>PRDM9 partner proteins (Mulligan et al., 2008; Parvanov et al., 2017). Given the <lb/>precisely regulated developmental changes in methylation status, <lb/>ZCWPW1/PRDM9 protein abundance, and chromatin during meiosis <lb/>(Gaysinskaya et al., 2018; Seisenberger et al., 2013) it is unclear whether <lb/>ZCWPW1 will also weakly bind Alus in vivo. However, if CpG dinucleotides do <lb/></body>

			<page>31 <lb/></page>

			<body>retain weak in vivo ZCWPW1 binding affinity, and given that CpG methylation is <lb/>associated with transposons, it is interesting to speculate whether ZCWPW1 might <lb/>play a role in germline transposon recognition, silencing, or facilitate repair of DSBs <lb/>occurring within transposable elements. <lb/>Zcwpw1 possesses a paralogue, Zcwpw2, which is also co-expressed in <lb/>testis with Prdm9 (although at a lower level), possesses both CW and PWWP <lb/>domains, and has been shown to be able to recognise H3K4me3 at least (Liu et <lb/>al., 2016). Further studies are required to investigate what function if any Zcwpw2 <lb/>has in meiosis. One interesting possibility is that Zcwpw2, rather than Zcwpw1, <lb/>might act to help position DSBs -if so, its low abundance relative to Zcwpw1 would <lb/>be analogous to the low number of DSBs per meiosis (~300) relative to the number <lb/>of PRDM9 binding sites. <lb/>In this study we have shown that Zcwpw1 co-evolves with Prdm9, binds to <lb/>sites marked by PRDM9, and is required for the proper processing, removal of <lb/>DMC1, and repair of DSBs. How exactly it mediates repair, if for example by <lb/>recruitment of other proteins, remains to be determined. This study also further <lb/>demonstrates that genes co-expressed with PRDM9 represent a rich source of <lb/>undiscovered meiotic genes, with important functional implications for <lb/>recombination, meiosis progression and ultimately fertility. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Orthologue Alignment <lb/>We identified ZCWPW1 orthologues across species using four data sources: first, <lb/>we used BlastP (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), against the full-length human reference <lb/>ZCWPW1 sequence (identifier NP_060454.3, against nr_v5 database) storing the <lb/>top 1000 hits using the default parameters (set 1). Secondly, we downloaded the <lb/>two <lb/>sets <lb/>of <lb/>Ensembl <lb/>identified <lb/>ZCWPW1 <lb/>orthologues <lb/>(against <lb/>ENSMUSG00000037108.13; ensembl.org, 105 orthologues), and identified NCBI <lb/>ZCWPW1 protein orthologues (146 species, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Initial <lb/>examination of identified orthologues revealed conservation among orthologues <lb/>mainly of the ZW and PWWP domains; therefore, to find additional orthologues <lb/>sequences we performed tBLASTn (against the nr/nt nucleotide collection 17 th July <lb/>2019; top 1000 hits) to identify orthologues in the NCBI nucleotide database, to the <lb/>partial sequence (amino acids 256-339 of the reference sequence NP_060454.3), <lb/>corresponding to the ZW and PWWP domains of ZCWPW1. Protein sequences <lb/>were then aligned against full-length human ZCWPW1 (NP_060454.3) using <lb/>BLASTP2.9 (Altschul et al., 2005, 1997) We obtained taxonomy information from <lb/>the <lb/>folder <lb/>https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/, <lb/>for <lb/>comparisons among species and between ZCWPW1 and PRDM9. <lb/>Previous work has identified highly conserved &quot;KWR&quot; and &quot;PWWP&quot; <lb/>patterns among ZW and PWWP domains, respectively (Fahu He et al., 2010; Qin <lb/>and Min, 2014). We thus identified an initial set of &quot;clear&quot; ZCWPW1 orthologues, <lb/>and then used these to identify further less precise matches. &quot;Clear&quot; orthologues <lb/>are defined as proteins within set 1 containing perfect matches to both these <lb/>sequences, and such that in the NCBI alignment, at least 39% of each sequence <lb/>aligns to the human protein, and conversely. This second step is required to avoid <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>spurious matches to e.g. ZCWPW2, which overlaps 19% of ZCWPW1, by requiring <lb/>&gt;2-fold this match length; although several ZCWPW2 copies are in our initial list, <lb/>no gene annotated as most similar to ZCWPW2 attains the 39% overlap. For <lb/>proteins within the &quot;clear&quot; set, we identified the longest alignment for each given <lb/>species, resulting in 136 species with a likely ZCWPW1 orthologue. This initial <lb/>screen identified three groups of fish, placental mammals, marsupials, <lb/>monotremes and reptiles as likely possessing ZCWPW1, similar to our final <lb/>conclusions. Moreover, it defined amino acids 247-428 in the human reference <lb/>sequence as being conserved in the alignment (at most 1 sequence not aligning), <lb/>including the annotated ZCW and PWWP domains. <lb/>Using this initial set, we identified additional orthologous sequences and <lb/>refined our results, by identifying conserved bases within ZCWPW1. Specifically, <lb/>we divided the 136 species into major clades, as in (Baker et al., 2017), and gave <lb/>each sequence a weighting so that the overall weight for each clade was the same <lb/>(so e.g. each Placental mammal sequence was downweighted as this clade was <lb/>over-represented). Within the consistently aligned region 247-428, we calculated <lb/>the overall weighted probability of each of the 20 amino acids, or a gap (adding 10 -<lb/>5 to exclude zero weights). This identified 31 completely conserved amino acids, <lb/>and 78 amino acids whose entropy was below 1 (equivalent to 2 amino acids, <lb/>having equal probability, so implying one amino acid present &gt;50% of the time). <lb/>Finally, we defined ZCWPW1 orthologues as those sequences matching at least <lb/>90% of those 31 perfectly conserved bases which were aligned, and aligning to at <lb/>least 50% of these bases (this last condition allows for inclusion of incomplete <lb/>sequencing or protein assembly). We note that while this 90% condition is arbitrary, <lb/>by definition all annotated orthologues exceed this threshold, while thresholds <lb/>below ~70-80% are exceeded by orthologues of ZCWPW2 among other genes, <lb/>offering some justification. Nonetheless, it is worth pointing out that our analysis <lb/></body>

			<body>does not rule out the existence of more poorly conserved ZCWPW1 copies in more <lb/>distantly related species. This approach identified a final set of 167 genes, which <lb/>we annotated as likely ZCWPW1 orthologues and used for the majority of results. <lb/>For each ZCWPW1 orthologue, we also identified the taxonomic relationship of the <lb/>closest species possessing such a PRDM9 copy (Supplementary Table 1). We <lb/>also reciprocally annotated each PRDM9 copy previously identified (Baker et al., <lb/>2017) according to the closest species also possessing ZCWPW1 <lb/>(Supplementary Table 1). <lb/>Our analyses revealed a relationship between ZCWPW1 predicted <lb/>functional domains and PRDM9 histone modifications. Therefore, we identified <lb/>additional potential conserved sites by identifying perfectly conserved bases <lb/>among those species possessing both ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 orthologues, and <lb/>where three key SET domain catalytic amino acids within PRDM9 are intact, <lb/>meaning PRDM9 is predicted to have normal histone modification activity (Baker <lb/>et al., 2017). This identified a slightly larger number of conserved amino acids (37). <lb/>Only eight of these varied in any of the 167 species with a potential ZCWPW1 <lb/>orthologue: 260, 404 and 411 (in two Xenopus frogs, with 411 also in white-headed <lb/>capuchin), 19 and 22 (in three canines), 25 (in Ocelot gecko), 257 (in Anolis lizard <lb/>and in Wombat), 325 (in elephantfish). While these changes might alter ZCWPW1 <lb/>function, the true behaviour of ZCWPW1 is uncertain in these cases, though it is <lb/>interesting that canids and frogs represent clades that all appear to have lost <lb/>PRDM9, and possess multiple, clustered, amino acid changes. <lb/>Domain Search <lb/>pDomThreader (Lobley et al., 2009), was used via the PSIPRED server <lb/>(http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) on the following uniProt amino acid <lb/>sequences <lb/>(Q9H0M4|ZCPW1_HUMAN, <lb/>Q6IR42|ZCPW1_MOUSE, <lb/></body>

Supplementary <lb/>Figure 13 also uses this measure, of ZCWPW1 recruitment attributable to PRDM9 <lb/>binding, to predict DMC1 levels, while Supplementary Figure 21 (right panel) <lb/>checks that changes in ZCWPW1 occupancy occur largely at PRDM9-bound sites. <lb/>We analysed previously published H3K4me3 and SPO11 read data (Davies et al., <lb/>2016; Lange et al., 2016). <lb/>Enrichment Profiles for HEK293T experiments <lb/>Peaks were filtered if: center within 2.5kb of PRDM9 independent H3K4me3 <lb/>(promoters), input coverage &lt;=5, in top 5 by likelihood, greater than 99.9 percentile <lb/>input coverage. For human PRDM9 peaks the PRDM9 motif position (Altemose et <lb/>al., 2017) was inferred using the getmotifs function in MotifFinder within the 300bp <lb/>region around the peak (with parameters alpha=0.2, maxits=10, seed=42, <lb/>stranded_prior=T), and peaks were recentered and stranded at these locations. <lb/>Peaks within 4kb of one another are removed to avoid double counting.
