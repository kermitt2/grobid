Here, we describe a 4D simulation method, PHi-C (Polymer <lb/> dynamics deciphered from Hi-C data), that depicts dynamic 3D genome features through <lb/>polymer modelling. This method allows for demonstrations of dynamic characteristics of <lb/>genomic loci and chromosomes, as observed in live-cell imaging experiments, and provides <lb/>physical insights into Hi-C data. <lb/></front>

			<body>Genomes consist of one-dimensional DNA sequences and are spatio-temporally organized <lb/>within the cell nucleus. Contact frequencies in the form of matrix data, measured using genome-<lb/>wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies, have uncovered three-dimensional <lb/>(3D) features of average genome organization in a cell population 1, 2 . Moreover, live-cell imaging <lb/>experiments can reveal dynamic chromatin organization in response to biological perturbations <lb/>within single cells 3, 4 . Bridging the gap between these different sets of data derived from population <lb/>and single cells is a challenge for modelling dynamic genome organization 5, 6 . <lb/>Several modelling methods have been developed to reconstruct 3D genome structures and <lb/>predict Hi-C data 7, 8 . In addition, there has been development of bioinformatic normalization <lb/>techniques in Hi-C matrix data processing to reduce experimental biases 9-11 . However, the mean-<lb/>ing of a contact matrix as quantitative probability data has not been discussed; moreover, a four-<lb/>dimensional (4D) simulation method to explore dynamic 3D genome organization remains lacking. <lb/>Here, we introduce PHi-C, a method that can overcome these challenges by polymer mod-<lb/>elling from a mathematical perspective and at low computational cost. PHi-C is a method that <lb/></body>

			<body>deciphers Hi-C data into polymer dynamics simulations (Fig. 1a, https://github.com/ <lb/>soyashinkai/PHi-C). PHi-C uses Hi-C contact matrix data generated from a hic file through <lb/>JUICER 12 as input (Supplementary Fig. 1a). PHi-C assumes that a genomic region of interest at <lb/>an appropriate resolution can be modelled using a polymer network model, in which one monomer <lb/>corresponds to the genomic bin size of the contact matrix data with attractive and repulsive interac-<lb/>tion parameters between all pairs of monomers described as matrix data (Methods, Supplementary <lb/>Note). Instead of finding optimized 3D conformations, we can utilize the optimization procedure <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) to obtain optimal interaction parameters of the polymer network model <lb/>by using an analytical relationship between the parameters and the contact matrix. We can then <lb/>reconstruct an optimized contact matrix validated by input Hi-C matrix data using Pearson&apos;s cor-<lb/>relation r. Finally, we can perform polymer dynamics simulations of the polymer network model <lb/>equipped with the optimal interaction parameters. <lb/>First, we evaluated PHi-C&apos;s theoretical assumption about chromosome contact. Here, we <lb/>started with a simple polymer model called the bead-spring model, in which the characteristic <lb/>length b between adjacent beads (or monomers) represents the physical size corresponding to one <lb/>genomic bin of the contact matrix data. To mathematically define the contact between a pair of <lb/>monomers, we introduced the contact Gaussian kernel with the contact distance σ (Fig. 1b). The <lb/>above assumption can be used to derive the theoretical scaling relationship of the contact probabil-<lb/>ity, P (s) ∼ s −d f /3 , as a function of genomic distance s in terms of the fractal dimension of polymer <lb/>organization d f <lb/>13 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). In addition, interestingly, the ratio of the contact dis-<lb/>tance to the length between adjacent monomers, σ/b, makes the shape of the contact probability <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>rounder at a small genomic distance (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This phenomenon implies that the <lb/>rounded shape conveys information about the ratio σ/b. To assess our theoretical framework about <lb/>contact and how the contact distance varies in Hi-C experiments, we analysed yeast Hi-C data at <lb/>nucleosome resolution 14 . The fitted value was σ/b = 1.12, suggesting that contacts mainly occur <lb/>within a distance corresponding to the size of a nucleosome in this super-resolution Hi-C experi-<lb/>ment (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2c). Other high-resolution Hi-C data for human GM12878 10 <lb/>revealed σ/b = 1.38, suggesting that cross-linking of Hi-C experiments almost exactly captures <lb/>chromosome contacts with an appropriate resolution (Supplementary Fig. 2d). <lb/>An important step in the optimization procedure is based on analytical matrix transforma-<lb/>tions between the polymer network model and the contact matrix (Fig. 1d, Methods). The matrix <lb/>transformations provided us with a low computational cost optimization strategy that can be ap-<lb/>plied to find optimal interaction parameters of the polymer network model without sampling op-<lb/>timal static 3D polymer conformations (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, we can depict any <lb/>contact patterns in a moment by using the matrix transformations and perform polymer dynamics <lb/>simulations by designing interactions in the polymer network model (Fig. 1e-g, Supplementary <lb/>Videos 1-3). Intra-and inter-domain interactions generate a chequerboard pattern reminiscent of <lb/>A/B compartments 1, 2 , and the attractive interaction domains form a combined domain (Fig. 1e). <lb/>Loop interactions show a clear punctate pattern (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, we can depict a topolog-<lb/>ically associating domain (TAD)-like pattern 1, 2 by only tuning heterogeneous connectivity along <lb/>the polymer backbone, where less connected regions behave as domain boundaries (Fig. 1g; left). <lb/>The 3D conformation suggests that the boundary regions are physically elongated with insulat-<lb/></body>

			<body>ing inter-TAD-like-domain interactions. In addition, the removal of a boundary part causes the <lb/>adjacent domain fusion (Fig. 1g; right) that reminds us of fusions of TADs 8, 15 . <lb/>To investigate how PHi-C explains 4D features of chromosomes within living cells, we ap-<lb/>plied this approach to Hi-C data for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) 16 . A live-cell imaging <lb/>experiment showed a marked difference in the movements of Nanog and Oct4 loci in mESCs 17 : <lb/>statistically significant enhancement of Nanog diffusive movement compared with Oct4 diffusive <lb/>movement was revealed (Supplementary Fig. 3). The optimization step of the PHi-C analysis <lb/>for chromosomes 6 and 17 provided optimized contact matrices with correlations of more than <lb/>97% between the Hi-C and optimized contact matrices (Fig. 2a). The mean-squared displacement <lb/>(MSD) curves that were theoretically derived from the optimized data for the Nanog locus on chro-<lb/>mosome 6 and the Oct4 locus on chromosome 17 are consistent with the experimental dynamics <lb/>(Fig. 2b). We also compared the physical sizes of 50.5-Mb genomic regions around the Nanog and <lb/>Oct4 loci, with the inclusion of several areas that highly interact with each locus, and observed <lb/>more compact organization of the Nanog region (Fig. 2c). Taking together, these findings indicate <lb/>that PHi-C analysis can provide new insights into genome organization and dynamics: for exam-<lb/>ple, a region of 50.5 Mb around Nanog adopts a more compact organization than an equivalent <lb/>region around Oct4, and the Nanog locus on chromosome 6 is more mobile than the Oct4 locus on <lb/>chromosome 17 (Fig. 2d). <lb/>Finally, we used PHi-C to demonstrate the dynamic chromosome condensation process for <lb/>the highly synchronous entry of DT-40 cells, which revealed a pathway for mitotic chromosome <lb/></body>

			<body>formation 18 . The optimized contact matrices at five different time points were reconstructed with <lb/>high correlations (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 4). Using the optimized interaction parameters in <lb/>the polymer network model (Supplementary Fig. 5), we conducted 4D simulations starting from a <lb/>comparatively elongated conformation at 0 min. The polymer conformation dynamically changed <lb/>into a rod-shaped structure, revealing the condensation state of chromosomes at prometaphase <lb/>(Fig. 2f, Supplementary Videos 4, 5). We evaluated dynamic changes in polymer conformations <lb/>in simulations by calculating the characteristic shape lengths of the major and minor axes. As <lb/>observed by microscopy, rapid and gradual decreases in the minor and major axes within 15 and <lb/>60 min indicated thin and thick rod-shaped formations, respectively (Fig. 2g). In addition, the <lb/>optimized interaction parameters averaged at each genomic separation represent not only strong <lb/>compaction within 2 Mb during mitosis but also increase of periodicity of long-range attractive <lb/>interactions from 3 Mb to 12 Mb in prometaphase (Fig. 2h). These physical findings are consistent <lb/>with a helical organization in rod-shaped chromosomes during prometaphase 18 . <lb/>We have shown that PHi-C can decipher Hi-C data into polymer dynamics, based on a math-<lb/>ematical theory of chromosome contacts in the polymer network model. As shown for mESC <lb/>Hi-C data, PHi-C analysis can bridge the gap between Hi-C data and imaging data with respect <lb/>to chromatin dynamics in living cells. In addition, PHi-C&apos;s theoretical basis allows for the de-<lb/>piction of any Hi-C pattern by designing the appropriate interaction parameters, which supports <lb/>a model for TAD formation: physical chromatin stiffness based on certain molecular interactions <lb/>creates insulation at TAD boundaries 19 . Polymer modelling studies have revealed that chromatin <lb/>modifications alter the physical properties of chromatin fibres and affect chromosome organiza-<lb/></body>

Because PHi-C analysis can extract physical interaction parameters from Hi-C data, it <lb/>should be elucidated which molecular interactions on chromatin are related to physical parameters. <lb/>Further comprehensive PHi-C analysis could provide physical insights into molecular interactions <lb/>on chromosomes. <lb/></body>

PHi-C enables us to decipher Hi-C data into polymer dynamics simulation. <lb/>PHi-C is based on a theory of the polymer network model and defining contacts between two <lb/>monomers on the polymer (Supplementary Note).
