			<front>REBASE-a database for DNA restriction and <lb/>modification: enzymes, genes and genomes <lb/>Richard J. Roberts*, Tamas Vincze, Janos Posfai and Dana Macelis <lb/>New England Biolabs, Inc., 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA 01938, USA <lb/>Received September 14, 2009; Revised September 29, 2009; Accepted September 30, 2009 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>REBASE is a comprehensive database of informa-<lb/>tion about restriction enzymes, DNA methyl-<lb/>transferases and related proteins involved in the <lb/>biological process of restriction-modification <lb/>(R-M). It contains fully referenced information <lb/>about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschi-<lb/>zomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability, <lb/>methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. <lb/>Experimentally characterized homing endonucle-<lb/>ases are also included. The fastest growing <lb/>segment of REBASE contains the putative R-M <lb/>systems found in the sequence databases. <lb/>Comprehensive descriptions of the R-M content of <lb/>all fully sequenced genomes are available including <lb/>summary schematics. The contents of REBASE may <lb/>be browsed from the web (http://rebase.neb.com) <lb/>and selected compilations can be downloaded by <lb/>ftp (ftp.neb.com). Additionally, monthly updates <lb/>can be requested via email. <lb/></front>

			<body>OVERVIEW <lb/>The previous description of REBASE in the 2007 NAR <lb/>Database Issue (1) described 3805 biochemically or genet-<lb/>ically characterized restriction-modification (R-M) <lb/>systems and included an analysis of approximately 400 <lb/>bacterial and archaeal genomes that had been deposited <lb/>in the RefSeq Database of GenBank (2,3). Analysis of the <lb/>available sequence information in GenBank led to the pre-<lb/>diction of 2709 restriction enzyme (R) genes and 4485 <lb/>DNA methyltransferase (M) genes. These numbers have <lb/>now risen to 4990 R genes and 8080 M genes of which <lb/>3511 R and 5497 M genes have arisen from the 1050 <lb/>completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. <lb/>These putative R-M system genes are given systematic <lb/>names according to the agreed upon nomenclature rules <lb/>(4). The names all carry the suffix &apos;P&apos; to indicate their <lb/>putative status. In many cases, the recognition specificity <lb/>of these systems can be assigned with some degree of <lb/>confidence because of their similarity to biochemically <lb/>well-characterized enzymes. <lb/>The REBASE web site (http://rebase.neb.com) <lb/>summarizes all information known about every restriction <lb/>enzyme and any associated proteins. This includes the rec-<lb/>ognition sequences, cleavage sites, source, commercial <lb/>availability, sequence data, crystal structure information, <lb/>isoschizomers and methylation sensitivity. Within the <lb/>reference section of REBASE, links are maintained to <lb/>the full text of all papers whenever they are readily avail-<lb/>able on the web. Also, there is extensive reciprocal cross-<lb/>referencing between REBASE and NCBI, including links <lb/>to GenBank and PubMed and NCBI&apos;s LinkOut utility. <lb/>Links to other major databases such as UniProt (5), <lb/>PDB (6) and Pfam (7) are also maintained. There are <lb/>currently 3945 biochemically or genetically characterized <lb/>restriction enzymes in REBASE and of the 3834 Type II <lb/>restriction enzymes, 299 distinct specificities are known. <lb/>Six hundred and forty one restriction enzymes are com-<lb/>mercially available, including 235 distinct specificities. <lb/>As shown in Figure 1, the rate of discovery of new <lb/>putative restriction and modification genes is rising <lb/>rapidly. In contrast, the rate at which candidates are <lb/>being characterized biochemically has actually dropped <lb/>to the level it was three decades ago. Nevertheless, <lb/>because of the large number of sequenced examples of <lb/>biochemically characterized restriction systems, the <lb/>putative recognition sequences of predicted restriction <lb/>enzymes and DNA methyltransferases can be inferred. <lb/>Currently, all new sequences entering GenBank are <lb/>checked using data mining techniques for the presence <lb/>of R-M systems and, following extensive manual <lb/>checking, the resulting inferences are all included within <lb/>REBASE where they are clearly marked as predictions. <lb/>When analyzing DNA sequence data, it is the DNA <lb/>methyltransferase genes that are the more reliable <lb/>indicators of an R-M system and the presence, proper <lb/>order and characteristic spacing of well-conserved motifs <lb/>that are used to suggest likely candidates. <lb/>It should be noted that at the present time it is not <lb/>possible to distinguish DNA methyltransferases reliably <lb/>enough to be completely confident in the assignments. <lb/></body>

			<body>Some RNA and protein methyltransferases can sometimes <lb/>be confused for DNA methyltransferases as is widely <lb/>reflected by the annotations found in GenBank files. <lb/>In general, REBASE takes a liberal approach and <lb/>includes all likely candidates until it becomes clear that <lb/>non-DNA methyltransferases have been included <lb/>erroneously and then these are culled from the database. <lb/>The more widely divergent genes that encode the restric-<lb/>tion enzymes always reside close to the genes for their <lb/>cognate methyltransferases, but often they cannot be <lb/>recognized directly because they are a rapidly evolving <lb/>set of genes and frequently lack any sequence similarity <lb/>to any other genes in GenBank. However, other methods <lb/>can sometimes be used to infer their presence such as the <lb/>analysis of shotgun sequence data from which missing <lb/>clones can be inferred to be caused by the presence of <lb/>active restriction enzyme genes (8). <lb/>Given the wealth of experimental data, both published <lb/>and unpublished, contained within REBASE, it can be <lb/>an especially valuable resource during the annotation of <lb/>bacterial and archaeal genomes. With the plethora of <lb/>restriction systems that occur in all sequenced microbial <lb/>genomes, annotators are encouraged to use the resources <lb/>of the REBASE database or to contact the REBASE staff <lb/>if help is needed. Custom analyses of unpublished genome <lb/>sequence data are carried out upon request. <lb/>From the REBASE web site users have a variety of <lb/>resources available that facilitate the analysis of <lb/>sequence information including tools for analyzing <lb/>sequences (REBASE tools) that allow restriction enzyme <lb/>recognition sites to be found in submitted sequences <lb/>(NEBcutter) and an implementation of BLAST to allow <lb/>searching against all sequences in REBASE. Specialty lists <lb/>of sequence data (REBASE lists) such as all known Type <lb/>II restriction enzyme genes, all known Type I specificity <lb/>subunit genes, etc., are available for download. <lb/>The coming year will see some major additions to <lb/>REBASE in terms of new sequence acquisitions, such as <lb/>the inclusion of all metagenomic sequence data (only par-<lb/>tially analyzed to date) and a tool to permit users to <lb/>perform their own analysis of newly sequenced genomes. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1. The graph shows the numbers of R-M systems entering REBASE since its inception in 1975. The open bars show systems that have been <lb/>characterized either biochemically or genetically. The black bars show the increasing accumulation of potential R-M systems that have been found <lb/>by bioinformatic analysis of sequences in GenBank. The surge in 2004 represents the addition of metagenomic sequences from the Sargasso Sea <lb/>collecting expedition (9). <lb/></body>
