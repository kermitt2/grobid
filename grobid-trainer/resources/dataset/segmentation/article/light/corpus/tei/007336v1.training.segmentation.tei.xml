We found that several ethyl <lb/>esters are present at much higher levels in strains with functional mitochondria, <lb/>even in fermentative conditions. We confirmed the role of these ethyl esters in <lb/>attraction by examining an EEB1Δ strain which reduces ethyl ester production. We <lb/>found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these <lb/>compounds, and that they are produced at high levels by strains with functional <lb/>mitochondria in the fermentation of natural substrates. Collectively these <lb/>observations demonstrate the effect core metabolic processes have in mediating the <lb/>interaction between yeasts and insect vectors, and highlight the importance of non--<lb/>respirative mitochondrial functions in yeast ecology. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/> Since the early 20th century, the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and the <lb/>brewer&apos;s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been the preeminent model species <lb/>of molecular biology. Although generally studied by separate sets of researchers in <lb/>the lab, these species are found together in nature on fermenting fruit substrates -<lb/>an interaction that has received surprisingly little attention. <lb/>Their co--occurrence is no coincidence: each species benefits from the <lb/>presence of the other. Ethanol produced by S. cerevisiae protects D. melanogaster <lb/>larvae from predators [1], and D. melanogaster larvae preferentially feed on S. <lb/>cerevisiae, which provides a complete nutritional source for larval development [2, <lb/>3]. The non--motile S. cerevisiae, in turn, rely on D. melanogaster and other insects to <lb/>move to fresh, nutrient--rich substrates [4], and the burrowing activities of D. <lb/>melanogaster larvae expose nutritional sources to the yeast that would have been <lb/>otherwise inaccessible [5]. <lb/>Given the benefits that each species gains from this interaction, it is not <lb/>surprising that both yeast and fly appear to have evolved molecular mechanisms to <lb/>actively maintain their co--localization. <lb/>It is well known to anyone who keeps fruits in their kitchen that D. <lb/>melanogaster are attracted to fermenting fruit: an effect mediated almost entirely by <lb/>volatile molecules produced by yeasts, and not the fruity substrate [2], although the <lb/>substrate can have a significant effect on what compounds are produced[6--12]. <lb/>Numerous volatile compounds produced by S. cerevisiae activate specific odorant <lb/>receptor neurons in the D. melanogaster antennae, which are relayed to the odor <lb/>representation center of the fly brain, the antennal lobe [13, 14], and elicit specific <lb/>attractive and repulsive responses [2] [15--22]. <lb/>The response to individual compounds is complex, and includes various <lb/>types of attraction and avoidance behaviors. A small pulse of ethyl butyrate, for <lb/>example, is sufficient to keep a fly flying towards the source of the odorant for <lb/>twenty minutes without additional application of the odor, but this tracking is much <lb/>less pronounced for acetic acid, another attractive yeast--produced volatile [17]. <lb/>Mixtures of yeast--produced volatile compounds, more akin to what flies would <lb/>experience in nature, produce more complex, context--dependent responses [16]. <lb/>Different yeast species produce varying volatile bouquets, even when grown <lb/>on identical substrates [6, 8, 12, 23--26]. This variance in volatile bouquets is <lb/>observed across S. cerevisiae strains as well[24]. Further, fly species, and also <lb/>different D. melanogaster strains, show varying preferences for yeast strains and <lb/>species [27--29]. <lb/></body>

			<body>We became interested in the possibility that the large repertoire of genetic <lb/>tools available for these species would allow us to exploit these different types of <lb/>variation to better understand the molecular details of this interaction. As a first <lb/>step, we examined the response of a single D. melanogaster strain to different S. <lb/>cerevisiae strains grown under identical conditions. <lb/>Results <lb/>Two nearly isogeneic lab strains vary in their attractiveness to D. <lb/>melanogaster <lb/>We used a simple preference assay (see Methods) to screen a large panel of S. <lb/>cerevisiae strains, collected from diverse environments with varied histories of <lb/>laboratory use and propagation, for their attractiveness to a wild--caught D. <lb/>melanogaster line (Raleigh 437). We found considerable variation in the <lb/>attractiveness across the strains (corroborating the results of [24]). As we were <lb/>ultimately interested in exploring the genetic basis (in yeast) for this varied D. <lb/>melanogaster attractiveness, we also included the two nearly isogeneic haploid S. <lb/>cerevisiae strains, BY4741 and BY4742, which had been used to generate the <lb/>systematic yeast deletion collection [30]. We were astonished to find that traps <lb/>baited with BY4741, the MAT a parent, consistently attracted more flies when <lb/>directly competing against traps baited with BY4742, the MATα parent (Figure 1). <lb/>The remainder of this paper is focused on understanding the origins of this <lb/>preference difference. <lb/>Attraction difference between BY4741 and BY4742 is associated with <lb/>functional mitochondria <lb/>Outside of the mating type locus, these strains ostensibly differed at two <lb/>metabolic marker loci: MET17 (deleted in BY4741) and LEU2 (deleted in BY4742). <lb/>Given the known relationship between amino acid metabolism and volatile <lb/>compound production [6, 9, 10, 31--35], we suspected that the difference in <lb/>behavioral response to these two strains could be traced to their respective <lb/>auxotrophies. We therefore crossed BY4741 and BY4742 and dissected several <lb/>tetrads to obtain haploid strains with all eight possible genotypes at the three <lb/>variable loci (MAT, LEU2 and MET15). However, when we tested these strains using <lb/>our choice assay against BY4742, we found that all eight genotypes were strongly <lb/>preferred to BY4742, including the MATα; MET15; leu2∆ strain, which has the <lb/>identical three--locus genotype as BY4742 (Figure 2A). We tested a subset of these <lb/>strains against BY4741, and found that the flies preferred each strain equally <lb/>(Figure 2B). <lb/>This non--autosomal inheritance pattern immediately suggested <lb/>mitochondrial linkage. We tested both parental strains and all progeny for growth <lb/>on glycerol, a non--fermentable carbon source, and found that all of the strains grew <lb/>normally, except for BY4742 (Figure S1). This result confirmed a respiration <lb/>deficiency in the BY4742 strain used in this study, which we refer to hereon as <lb/>BY4742p, for petite. <lb/>To corroborate that the absence of a functional mitochondria reduces the <lb/>attractiveness of yeast strains to D. melanogaster, we tested an independent BY4742 <lb/>isolate (BY4742g, for grande), with a functional mitochondria <lb/>(MATα;his3;leu2;lys2;ura3), <lb/>as <lb/>well <lb/>the <lb/>MRPL16Δ <lb/>strain <lb/>(MATα;his3;leu2;lys2;ura3;mrpl16) from the same deletion collection. MRPL16 <lb/>encodes for the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein, the deletion of <lb/>which results in a respiration deficiency. We found that the independent BY4742g <lb/>was equally as attractive as BY4741, while MRPL16Δ strain was less attractive than <lb/>BY4741. Following the trend found with BY4741, we found BY4742g was also more <lb/>attractive than both BY4742p and the MRPL16Δ strain (Figure 3). This further <lb/>confirms that D. melanogaster are more attracted to S. cerevisiae strains possessing <lb/>
            functional mitochondria. <lb/>BY4741 and BY4742p strains produce different volatile bouquets, influenced <lb/>by their mitochondrial status <lb/>In the choice assay used here, D. melanogaster are selecting between <lb/>different yeast strains based primarily on how they smell. Thus, the absence of <lb/>functional mitochondria must be affecting the volatile compounds produced by the <lb/>yeast strains. We used GC--MS to characterize and quantify the volatile compounds <lb/>associated with both BY4741 and BY4742p grown on YPD plates, and, as expected, <lb/>found significant differences (Figure 4A). <lb/>To vary mitochondrial engagement, we next examined the volatile profiles of <lb/>BY4741 and BY4742p in liquid YPD cultures under both anaerobic and aerobic <lb/>conditions. The anaerobic and aerobic BY4742p cultures produced nearly identical <lb/>chromatograms (Figure S2). In contrast, the anaerobic and aerobic BY4741 cultures <lb/>differed, with the anaerobic BY4741 culture resembling the BY4742p culture, and <lb/>the aerobic BY4741 culture showing a marked increase in the same set of <lb/>compounds found at higher levels in BY4741 compared to BY4742p plates (Figure <lb/>S2; see also Figure S3 which shows a similar comparison for one of the sporulated <lb/>strains with identical genotype to BY4741). These potential attractants include: <lb/>ethyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, phenylethyl alcohol, <lb/>and ethyl octanoate (Table 1). <lb/>The affect of mitochondria on the volatile profile of a strain is, at least <lb/>superficially, an unexpected result. S. cerevisiae exhibit a phenomenon known as the <lb/>Crabtree effect, in which they preferentially ferment glucose to ethanol, even in the <lb/>presence of oxygen [36, 37]. Thus, we would not expect the absence of a functional <lb/>mitochondria to have a significant effect until available glucose has been depleted <lb/>and the yeast are forced to respire. However, our data clearly indicate that the <lb/>mitochondria are having a significant phenotypic effect during both fermentation <lb/>and respiration. <lb/>One possibility is that there is a low level of respiration in cultures that are <lb/>primarily fermenting. If respiration alone is driving attraction, then we would <lb/>expect older cultures, which should have higher rates of respiration, to be more <lb/>attractive. However, we found exactly the opposite: younger cultures of BY4741 are <lb/>more attractive than older cultures, suggesting that attractiveness is not entirely <lb/>respiration dependent (Figure 4B). <lb/>When we compared the volatile compounds produced by the older and <lb/>younger cultures using GC--MS we found that several of the potential attractants <lb/>(isoamyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol) continued to grow in concentration in the <lb/>older, respiring cultures, while the rest (isoamyl acetate, and the ethyl esters) <lb/>disappeared (Figure 4B). These results suggest that individual metabolites vary in <lb/>levels of attractiveness. We classified the esters: ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl <lb/>hexanoate, and ethyl octanoate, which are highest in the younger plates, as primary <lb/>attractants. We classified isoamyl alcohol and phenylethyl alcohol as secondary <lb/>attractants, as our results suggest these compounds are not as attractive as the <lb/>esters. <lb/>Overall, these observations suggested that high levels of esters produced by <lb/>BY4741 during our early time point are primarily driving attraction, and that they <lb/>are not strictly associated with respiration. Instead, they appear to arise from a <lb/>separate mitochondria--linked process. <lb/>EEB1 Δ strain affects ethyl ester production and attraction <lb/>To further investigate ethyl esters as attractants, we next tested the EEB1∆ <lb/>strain from the BY4741 knockout collection (MATa;his3;leu2;met15;ura3;eeb1). <lb/>Both EEB1 and its paralog EHT1 have been implicated in medium chain ethyl ester <lb/>production, with most of the function attributed to EEB1 [38, 39]. We found the <lb/>EEB1∆ strain to be less attractive than BY4741 in our behavioral assay when strains <lb/>were grown for the standard incubation time (Figure 5). GC--MS analysis confirmed <lb/>a decrease in the production of both isoamyl acetate and ethyl esters in the EEB1∆ <lb/>strain, further implicating these compounds as important attractants in these <lb/>cultures (Figure 5). <lb/>Nitrogen source affects both the production of identified attractants and fly <lb/>preference <lb/>Although it is not widely appreciated, the mitochondria is required for <lb/>several metabolic processes not related to respiration [40]. For example, both <lb/>
            proline catabolism and branched chain amino acid anabolism have biochemical <lb/>steps that occur within the mitochondria [41, 42]. We therefore reasoned that <lb/>varying nitrogen sources -especially those with and without amino acids, or with <lb/>different distributions of amino acids -might lead to the differential engagement of <lb/>the mitochondria, different volatile compound production, and different <lb/>attractiveness to flies. <lb/>To test this we grew a prototropic, wild caught S. cerevisiae strain, T73, on <lb/>media containing equivalent carbon source (5% glucose) and varying types and <lb/>levels of nitrogen (Table 2). We collected GC--MS data for each condition and tested <lb/>all pairwise comparisons between these media in our behavioral assay. We found <lb/>that varying the nitrogen source had a dramatic effect on the types and levels of <lb/>volatile compounds produced by the culture, including the identified attractants <lb/>from our BY4741 strain (Figure 6). Further, the level of the attractive compounds <lb/>produced matched with behavior: the culture that produced higher combined levels <lb/>of attractive compounds in each pairwise comparison was always more attractive to <lb/>D. melanogaster (Figure 6). <lb/>Interestingly, across all pairwise comparisons, the most attractive medium <lb/>tested was the synthetic complete medium (SC), which most closely matched the <lb/>nutrient composition of a fruit, the natural substrate of S. cerevisiae. Like fruit, SC <lb/>media contained a mixed pool of amino acids as a nitrogen source and high levels of <lb/>sugar (5% glucose) (Table 2). This nutritional composition makes sense for ester <lb/>production. The high levels of sugar allow for uninhibited fermentation, while the <lb/>amino acid based nitrogen supply can be more efficiently consumed when the <lb/>mitochondria are functioning. Ethyl esters are formed from the fermentation <lb/>byproducts, ethanol and aliphatic acids, largely via EEB1 activity. The reaction <lb/>requires ATP, which will be far more abundant in fermenting cells with functional <lb/>mitochondria [38, 39]. We propose that D. melanogaster have evolved to sense these <lb/>esters specifically and use them as a signal of S. cerevisiae fermenting a sugar--rich <lb/>fruit substrate, an ideal oviposition site for D. melanogaster females. <lb/>The prototrophic strain, T73, grown on a natural fruit substrate produces the <lb/>highest levels of identified attractants <lb/>Based on the results of our nitrogen experiments, we collected GC--MS <lb/>profiles of T73 grown on pureed grape agar. The GC--MS profiles for these cultures <lb/>were dominated by our identified attractants. These cultures contained the highest <lb/>level of ethyl esters and isoamyl acetate seen in this study (Figure 7). These grape--<lb/>based fermentations were extremely attractive to D. melanogaster and reliably <lb/>attracted more flies than the most attractive media from previous comparisons (5% <lb/>SC) (Figure 7). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>S. cerevisiae is a versatile microbe that can survive and propagate on many <lb/>nutritional sources. Different combinations of substrate and genotype impose <lb/>unique metabolic demands on the yeast, leading to the production of distinct <lb/>volatile profiles. These characteristic volatile fingerprints can, in turn, signal to <lb/>other organisms, such as D. melanogaster, information about the substrate, and, <lb/>potentially, its suitability for their purposes. In this work, we have identified a piece <lb/>of the volatile vocabulary that helps bring together S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster <lb/>in nature. <lb/>Our research shows that mitochondria affect S. cerevisiae metabolism even <lb/>during periods of fermentation, and that these metabolic alterations dramatically <lb/>influence the volatile small molecules produced and released by S. cerevisiae. In this <lb/>way, S. cerevisiae cells with and without functional mitochondria, grown on the <lb/>same substrate, produce different volatile profiles. We have shown that D. <lb/>melanogaster are able to sense the differences in the volatiles produced by these <lb/>strains and prefer the volatile &quot;fingerprint&quot; produced by yeast strains with <lb/>mitochondria. Using GC--MS, we identified the molecular compounds produced at <lb/>higher levels in the attractive cultures and tagged these compounds as <lb/>mitochondrially--associated attractants. <lb/>We also found that varying the type of nitrogen provided to a culture changes <lb/>the levels and varieties of volatiles it produces, including our mitochondrially--<lb/>associated attractants. This makes sense, as metabolism of many nitrogen sources <lb/>are known to be associated with mitochondria. We found the highest levels of our <lb/>attractants when the wild--caught S. cerevisiae strain was grown on a media <lb/>substrate with a nutritional composition similar to that of fruit. Like fruit, the media <lb/>contained high levels of fermentable sugars and a mixture of amino acids as a <lb/>nitrogen source -a nutritional scenario lending towards a combination of <lb/>fermentation and mitochondrial activity. <lb/>Together these results suggest that D. melanogaster&apos;s preference towards <lb/>mitochondrially--associated metabolites may have an ecological basis. We <lb/>hypothesize that D. melanogaster have tuned their senses towards these <lb/>mitochondria--associated attractants, as these compounds are produced when S. <lb/>cerevisiae are actively fermenting a fruit, where the combination of yeast and <lb/>ethanol produce an ideal environment for D. melanogaster larvae to develop and <lb/>remain protected from other microbial threats. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Behavioral setup: <lb/>A custom--crafted behavior arena and assay protocol was developed for these <lb/>experiments. Five behavior assays were conducted in parallel. Twenty--two hours <lb/>(4pm) prior to starting a trial, the specific yeast strains to be tested were streaked <lb/>from stock plates (stored at 4C and re--streaked from freezer stock (--80C) every two <lb/>weeks) onto freshly prepared 60x15mm Petri dish plates (see &apos;Media Preparation&apos; <lb/>for details). Plates were then transferred to 30C incubator and grown overnight. <lb/>Twenty--two hours later (2pm, following day) plates were removed from incubator <lb/>and behavioral traps were assembled for the assay. <lb/>To construct the traps, the cultures were topped with a custom--designed and <lb/>3D printed lid (uPrint Plus), which was then secured into place with Parafilm. The <lb/>custom lid allowed for the attachment of a 50 mL Falcon tube (bottom sawed off to <lb/>create a long, open tube) above the plate. A small piece of metal mesh was secured <lb/>between the adapter and falcon tube to allow for the volatiles emitted from the <lb/>culture to dissipate up through the Falcon tube, while physically separating the plate <lb/>from the Falcon tube chamber. The Falcon tube chamber was finally topped with a <lb/>funnel fashioned out of Whatman Grade 1 Filter paper (15.0cm diameter). The <lb/>funnel was secured in place by a small piece of lab tape (Figure S4). <lb/>
            The constructed traps were next transferred into the behavior chambers: 24&quot; <lb/>high, 12&quot; diameter clear, open--ended, acrylic cylinders (TAP plastics) fitted with <lb/>closable sleeve that allowed for placement and removal of both the traps and flies <lb/>(Figure S4). Behavior chambers were kept in a large room with over--head, diffuse <lb/>lighting that remained on for the entirety of the trial. The chambers were vacuumed <lb/>and cleaned with water and ethanol before each trail. Four traps were placed in <lb/>each cleaned arena, two for each yeast strain under analysis. Each strain pair was <lb/>tested in three different orientations: 2X2 (with the same strain next to each other) <lb/>in each orientation and a diamond orientation (with the same stain across from the <lb/>other).  One hundred and twenty 4--10 day old D. melanogaster were added into the <lb/>behavioral chamber between 3 and 3:30 pm (see &quot;Fly Husbandry and Handling&quot; <lb/>section for details). The traps were removed from the chambers 18h later, between <lb/>10 and 10:30 am. Before removal the orientation of each trap in each arena was <lb/>recorded. Flies in each trap were then sexed, counted, and recorded. These raw <lb/>counts were used to determine the preference for each strain in each arena. The <lb/>raw data can be found in Spreadsheet 1. <lb/>Calculation of Fly Preference (Preference Index): <lb/>To quantify and compare independent behavioral trials, we used a simple <lb/>preference index: <lb/>Every behavioral trial contained four traps. Two baited with yeast strain &quot;A&quot; and <lb/>two baited with strain &quot;B&quot;. One hundred and twenty 4--10 day old D. melanogaster <lb/>were added into each behavioral trial: <lb/>A= Total D. melanogaster caught in both traps baited yeast strain &quot;A&quot; in the trial <lb/>B= Total D. melanogaster caught in both traps baited yeast strain &quot;B&quot; in the trial <lb/>Preference Index (PI)= A--B/(A+B)/2 <lb/>Fly Husbandry and Handling: <lb/>D. melanogaster line Raleigh 437 was obtained from Bloomington Stock <lb/>Center for use in these experiments. All D. melanogaster used in behavioral assays <lb/>were raised using the same regimen.  A &quot;time course&quot; for each line was maintained <lb/>for the duration of the experiments. The time course consisted of pushing 3 vials of <lb/>25 flies into fresh media (CSM formula) topped with dried yeast pellets (Red Star) <lb/>daily. The 25 flies were refreshed with 4--day--old flies from a stock population every <lb/>10 days. The time course of vials was kept at 18C and the eggs laid in each vial were <lb/>allowed to develop (~18 day generation time). After ~18 days, each seeded vial <lb/>was checked daily for newly eclosed flies. All flies hatching off of on a given day <lb/>were transferred into fresh vials and stored in a 25C incubator for at least 4 days to <lb/>ensure full development and maturation to adulthood. The entire process was <lb/>repeated daily to maintain each strain. <lb/>To prepare flies for a behavioral trial, aged 4--10 day old flies were removed <lb/>from the 25C incubator and anaesthetized using CO2 and counted into groups of <lb/>120. The groups were visually inspected to insure roughly equal numbers of males <lb/>and females. The flies were transferred into a vial of fresh food and allowed to <lb/>recover and eat for 2--4 hours before being added into the behavior chamber. <lb/>A stock of Raleigh 437 was maintained at 18C and transferred to fresh media <lb/>monthly. <lb/>Media Preparation: <lb/>5% YPD for behavioral assays and strain storage was prepared weekly using <lb/>the following recipe (for 1L): 20g Peptone (BD Bacto Peptone), 10g Yeast Extract <lb/>(Amresco Yeast Extract, Bacteriological, Ultra Pure Grade), 50g Dextrose (Fisher <lb/>Scientific Dextrose Anhydrous), 20g Agar (BD Bacto Agar), Water to 1L. Solution <lb/>was mixed and heated to boiling on a magnetic stir plate. Liquid YPD was prepared <lb/>using (for 1L): 20g Peptone, 10g Yeast Extract, 50g Dextrose, Water to 1L. The <lb/>solution was stirred for five minutes and filter sterilized using Nalgene vacuum <lb/>filtration system (0.22 micron). <lb/>The following additional recipes were used in this experiment: <lb/>5% SC (for 1L): 1.7g YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (BD Difco), <lb/>2.0g SC Amino acid mixture (MP Biomedicals), 50g Dextrose, 20g Agar, Water to 1L. <lb/>5%YNB (for 1L): 6.7g YNB without amino acids (BD Difco), 50g Dextrose, 20g Agar, <lb/>Water to 1L. <lb/>Grape Agar (for 1L): 1.7g YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 1L <lb/>organic grapes (v/v) (thoroughly washed and pureed in food processor), 20g Agar, <lb/>Water to 1L. <lb/>Yeast strains: <lb/>Strain <lb/>Genotype <lb/>Source <lb/>BY4741 <lb/>MATa;his3;leu2;met15;ura3 <lb/>ATCC <lb/>BY4742p <lb/>MATα;his3;leu2;lys2;ura3 <lb/>This Study <lb/>BY4742g <lb/>MATα;his3;leu2;lys2;ura3 <lb/>ATCC <lb/>MRPL16Δ (BY4742) MATα;his3;leu2;lys2;ura3;mrpl16 <lb/>Calahan et al (2011)[43] <lb/>EEB1Δ (BY4741) <lb/>MATa;his3;leu2;met15;ura3;eeb1 <lb/>ATCC <lb/>T73 (ATCC28383) <lb/>Wild isolate <lb/>Hyma and Faye(2011)[44] <lb/>Tetrad Experiment: <lb/>Twenty tetrads were obtained using a standard sporulation protocol <lb/>(Methods in Yeast Genetics, 2005).

Diploid colonies were selected by replica <lb/>plating onto a selective media (Met(--);Lys(--)) transferred to liquid &quot;YPA&quot; media for 1 <lb/>day, spun down and resuspended in &quot;Minimal Spo&quot; for at least 3 days. Ascii were <lb/>dissolved and tetrads dissected. After incubation, tetrads were genotyped by replica <lb/>plating onto selective media for MAT, LYS, and MET loci.

The Twister was then dried using a Kimwipe, <lb/>placed in a Gerstel thermal desorption sample tube, topped with a transport <lb/>adapter, and loaded into sampling tray. <lb/>Automated sampling and analysis was performed using the Gerstel MPS <lb/>system and MAESTRO integrated into Chemstation software. <lb/>Samples were thermally desorbed using the Gerstel Thermal Desorption Unit <lb/>(TDU), followed by injection into the column with a Gerstel Cooled Injection System <lb/>(CIS--4). Temperature program for desorption was 30C (.40 min), then 60C/min to <lb/>250C(hold for 5 mins). Temperature of the transfer line was set at 275C. The <lb/>injection was cooled with liquid nitrogen to --100C with a hold time (.60min).  The <lb/>injector inlet was operated in the Solvent Vent mode, with a vent pressure of 9.1473 <lb/>psi, a vent flow of 30mls/min, and a purge flow of 6mls/min (for .01 min). <lb/>The following GC--MS method parameters was used for each sample: The GC <lb/>temperature program was 40C (2 mins), then 4C/min to 140C (hold 0 mins), then <lb/>15C/min to 195C (hold for 0 min). The carrier gas head pressure was 9.1473 psi for <lb/>a flow rate of 1.2mL/min. The GC was operated in the constant flow mode. The MS <lb/>was operated in EI mode with the electron voltage set at autotune values. The <lb/>detector was set to scan from 30 to 300amu at a threshold of 150 with 3 samples <lb/>for a scanning rate of 2.69 scans/second. The MSD transfer line temperature was set <lb/>at 280C. The ion source and quadrupole temperatures were set at 230C and 150C, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>GC--MS data files were visually inspected using Chemstation. TIC peaks were <lb/>identified using the NIST O8 database via Chemstation. Datafiles were transferred, <lb/>parsed, and analyzed using custom written Matlab scripts (see &quot;Scripts <lb/>Supplement&quot;). <lb/>Aerobic and anaerobic yeast cultures: <lb/>Pairs of 100mL 5% YPD cultures were inoculated with BY4741 or BY4742p <lb/>cells (stored on a solid 5% YPD plate at 4C) and topped with either a loose foil cap <lb/>or fermentation bung (Ferm--Rite) to create aerobic and anaerobic growth <lb/>conditions for each strain. Cultures were grown for 21h shaking at room <lb/>temperature. After this growth period, cultures were removed from shaker, and an <lb/>O.D. reading was taken to ensure similar cell densities across each aerobic and <lb/>anaerobic culture pair. 50mL of each culture was transferred to a .22 micron <lb/>vacuum filter (MilliQ Steri--Flip) to remove yeast from the culture medium. 20mL of <lb/>the culture medium was then transferred into 20mL amber glass vials (Sigma), a <lb/>conditioned Twister stir bar (Gerstel) was added, and the vial was capped with a <lb/>silica--lined screw cap (Sigma). The Twister stir bars were spun in the medium at <lb/>300rpm for 40min, rinsed with MilliQ water, dried with a Kimwipe, and transferred <lb/>onto the GC--MS for analysis (see &quot;GC--MS protocol&quot; for details). <lb/>Glycerol plate growth: <lb/>BY4741 and BY472p and tetrads representing each genotype were streaked <lb/>from 5% YPD stock plates onto 5% glycerol plates. Plates were incubated at 30C for <lb/>48h and visually inspected for growth. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1: D. melanogaster are preferentially attracted to BY4741 over nearly <lb/>isogenic BY4742 <lb/>We compared D. melanogaster preference for different yeast strains using an open--<lb/>flight preference assay. Each black dot represents the results of a single open--flight <lb/>preference trial between lab stocks of BY4741 and BY4742.
