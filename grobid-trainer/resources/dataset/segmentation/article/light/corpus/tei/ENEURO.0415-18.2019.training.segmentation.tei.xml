			<front>Cognition and Behavior <lb/>Sexually Dimorphic Vasopressin Cells Modulate <lb/>Social Investigation and Communication in <lb/>Sex-Specific Ways <lb/>Nicole Rigney, 1 Jack Whylings, 1 Michihiro Mieda, 2 Geert de Vries, 1 and Aras Petrulis 1 <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0415-18.2019 <lb/>1 Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, and 2 Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan 920-1192 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and <lb/>communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the <lb/>sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social <lb/>communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct <lb/>in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive <lb/>and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and <lb/>increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), <lb/>resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In <lb/>females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but <lb/>otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex <lb/>differences in social behavioral function. <lb/>Key words: bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; mice; sex differences; social behavior; social communication; <lb/>vasopressin <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Social behavior and communication show profound sex <lb/>differences in many species (Darwin, 1871; Bradbury and <lb/>Vehrencamp, 1998), and in humans, dysfunction in social <lb/>behavior and communication is prominent in chronic, de-<lb/>bilitating, and pervasive psychopathologies (Insel, 2010) <lb/>that show sex differences in prevalence and clinical out-<lb/>come (Halladay et al., 2015), such as autism (Schultz, <lb/>2005). One reasonable hypothesis is that sex differences <lb/>in the underlying neural circuitry contribute to sexually <lb/>differentiated function and dysfunction in social behavior <lb/></body>

Here, we show that deletion of these <lb/>cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social commu-<lb/>nication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST <lb/>did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that <lb/>sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investiga-<lb/>tion, behavior, and communication. <lb/>New Research <lb/>January/February 2019, 6(1) e0415-18.2019 1-20 <lb/></front>

			<body>and communication. A particularly well-positioned circuit <lb/>in this respect is the arginine vasopressin (AVP) innerva-<lb/>tion of the brain, which shows marked sex differences <lb/>across many species, including humans (Goodson and <lb/>Bass, 2001; De Vries and Panzica, 2006; de Vries, 2008). <lb/>Research across taxa confirms an important role for AVP <lb/>in social behavior. For example, AVP has been implicated <lb/>in aggression, pair bonding, maternal behavior, and com-<lb/>munication across vertebrates (Goodson and Bass, 2001; <lb/>Albers, 2012). However, the anatomy of AVP projections <lb/>suggests that AVP control of social behavior is complex <lb/>and, in most cases, the anatomic substrate of AVP&apos;s <lb/>control of social behavior is unclear (Kelly and Goodson, <lb/>2013a; Ludwig and Stern, 2015; Dumais and Veenema, <lb/>2016). In most animals, AVP is synthesized in several cell <lb/>groups, each of which projecting to distinct brain areas <lb/>(De Vries and Boyle, 1998; Rood and De Vries, 2011; <lb/>Rood et al., 2013). AVP cells in the medial amygdala (MeA) <lb/>and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) contribute <lb/>to the most pronounced sex differences in AVP innerva-<lb/>tion in brain (De Vries and Boyle, 1998). For example, male <lb/>rats and mice have about two to three times as many AVP <lb/>cells as females in these nuclei and the projections of <lb/>these cells to areas such as lateral septum (LS) are denser <lb/>as well (van Leeuwen et al., 1985; Rood and De Vries, <lb/>2011; Rood et al., 2013; Otero-Garcia et al., 2014). <lb/>Various studies suggest that AVP cells in the BNST and <lb/>MeA modulate pro-social as well as antagonistic behav-<lb/>iors. In birds, for example, partial knock-down of AVP <lb/>gene expression in the BNST reduces prosocial vocaliza-<lb/>tions and social interactions in birds while increasing <lb/>male-male aggression (Kelly et al., 2011; Kelly and Good-<lb/>son, 2013a,b). Evidence for involvement of AVP projec-<lb/>tions from the BNST and MeA in social behavior in <lb/>mammals is less direct. For example, the density of AVP <lb/>fibers in BNST and MeA projection areas and c-Fos acti-<lb/>vation in AVP cells in the BNST correlate negatively with <lb/>aggression in male mice and rats (Compaan et al., 1993; <lb/>Everts et al., 1997; Ebner et al., 2000; Beiderbeck et al., <lb/>2007; Veenema et al., 2010) but positively with prosocial <lb/>behavior (Goodson et al., 2009; Ho et al., 2010). In addi-<lb/>tion, injecting specific V1a receptor agonists or boosting <lb/>V1a receptor expression in target areas of AVP cells in the <lb/>BNST and MeA promotes affiliation in voles (Wang et al., <lb/>1994; Liu et al., 2001; Pitkow et al., 2001; Lim and Young, <lb/>2004; Lim et al., 2004) and social recognition and active <lb/>social behaviors in rats (Dantzer et al., 1988; Veenema <lb/>et al., 2012). In rats, where AVP release in the septum, one <lb/>of the most prominent projection areas of BNST and MeA <lb/>AVP cells (De Vries and Buijs, 1983; De Vries and Panzica, <lb/>2006), correlates positively with intermale aggression in a <lb/>resident-intruder test, a behavioral response could be <lb/>blocked by retro-dialysis of an AVP antagonist (Veenema <lb/>et al., 2010). None of these results, however, can be tied <lb/>with certainty to AVP cells in the BNST and MeA, as all <lb/>these areas receive AVP input from other sources as well, <lb/>most importantly the PVN (Rood et al., 2013). In addition, <lb/>AVP released dendritically from neurosecretory neurons in <lb/>the hypothalamus may reach these areas as well (Ludwig <lb/>and Stern, 2015). To directly test the hypothesis that AVP <lb/>cells in the BNST modulate social behavior, we injected <lb/>an adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a Cre-dependent, <lb/>genetically modified executioner caspase-3 complex <lb/>(Yang et al., 2013; Unger et al., 2015) into the BNST of <lb/>adult AVP-iCreϩ and AVP-iCre-(Mieda et al., 2015) male <lb/>and female mice, which specifically deleted AVP cells in <lb/>the area, and tested the effects of these deletions on <lb/>social investigation, courtship ultrasonic vocalizations <lb/>(USVs; Chabout et al., 2015), and territorial urine marking <lb/>(UM; Arakawa et al., 2008b), all aspects of mouse com-<lb/>munication known to show pronounced sex differences <lb/>(Crawley, 2012; Lehmann et al., 2013; Wöhr, 2014). <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Animals and husbandry <lb/>All mice were maintained at 22°C on a 12/12 h reverse <lb/>light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum, <lb/>housed in individually ventilated cages (Animal Care Sys-<lb/>tems), and provided with corncob bedding, a nestlet <lb/>square, and a housing tube. All animal procedures were <lb/>performed in accordance with the Georgia State Univer-<lb/>sity animal care committee regulations and the National <lb/>Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Labo-<lb/>ratory Animals. <lb/>Subjects <lb/>Founding AVP-iCre mice were obtained from Dr. Michi-<lb/>hiro Mieda (Kanazawa University, Japan). These mice <lb/>were generated using a bacterial artificial chromosome <lb/>(BAC) that expressed codon-improved Cre recombinase <lb/>(Shimshek et al., 2002) under the transcriptional control of <lb/>the AVP promoter (AVP-iCre mice). In these animals, iCre <lb/>expression is found in the BNST and the MeA, as well as <lb/>in hypothalamic areas (Mieda et al., 2015). Subjects were <lb/>derived by crossing heterozygous iCreϩ mutants to wild-<lb/>type C57Bl/6J mice and genotyped (ear punch) by poly-<lb/>merase chain reaction (PCR) at 21-24 d of age <lb/>(Transnetyx). Both iCreϩ and iCre-littermates were used <lb/>in behavioral experiments. All subject mice were singly-<lb/>housed for a minimum of one week. <lb/>Stimulus animals <lb/>CD1(ICR) (Charles River Laboratories) mice were used <lb/>as stimuli for behavioral testing and to provide male and <lb/>female subjects with social experience because strain <lb/>differences between subjects and stimulus mice increase <lb/>social investigation (Gheusi et al., 1994). Mice were used <lb/>at 9 -16 weeks of age and were novel and unrelated to the <lb/>subject to which they were exposed. <lb/></body>

			<body>Female stimulus mice were group-housed, ovariecto-<lb/>mized, and implanted with an estradiol capsule (GDXϩE), <lb/>and given two sexual experiences before testing. Two <lb/>groups of stimulus males were used for behavioral test-<lb/>ing. Mice that were used as subordinate mice in the home <lb/>cage aggression tests and for providing aggressive expe-<lb/>rience to subjects, were group housed, gonadectomized <lb/>(GDX), and subjected to two aggressive encounters with a <lb/>dominant male. Mice in the second group, which provided <lb/>sexual experience to female subjects and served as sex-<lb/>ual partners during copulatory tests and as stimulus ani-<lb/>mal in the three-chamber social test, were singly-housed, <lb/>GDX, and implanted with testosterone (GDXϩT), and <lb/>given two sexual experiences before testing. <lb/>Viral vector <lb/>AVP driven-, Cre-expressing-BNST neurons were ab-<lb/>lated using an AAV (AAV-flex-taCasp3-TEVp; serotype <lb/>2/1; 3 ϫ 10 12 IU/ml; University of North Carolina at Chapel <lb/>Hill Vector Core) that encodes, in a Cre-dependent fash-<lb/>ion, a mutated pro-caspase-3 and its activator (TEVp; Fig. <lb/>1A). This system activates an apoptotic signaling cas-<lb/>cade, cleaving multiple structural and regulatory proteins <lb/>critical for cell survival and maintenance (Yang et al., <lb/>2013) and thereby inducing far less inflammation than <lb/>other lesion approaches (Morgan et al., 2014). <lb/>Surgery <lb/>All surgeries were conducted using 1.5-3% isoflurane <lb/>gas anesthesia in 100% oxygen; 3 mg/kg of carprofen <lb/>was given before surgery to reduce pain. <lb/>Stereotaxic surgery <lb/>Mice were positioned in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf <lb/>Instruments) with ear and incisor bars holding bregma and <lb/>lambda level. After a midline scalp incision, a hand oper-<lb/>ated drill was used to make holes in the skull exposing the <lb/>dura. For all subjects, 500 nl of AAV-flex-taCasp3-TEVp <lb/>was delivered bilaterally to the BNST (coordinates: AP <lb/>-0.01 mm; ML Ϯ0.75 mm; DV 4.8 mm; Paxinos and <lb/>Franklin, 2012) at a rate of 100 nl/min using a 5-l Ham-<lb/>ilton syringe with a 30-gauge beveled needle mounted on <lb/>a stereotaxic injector. Following virus delivery, the syringe <lb/>was left in place for 15 min and slowly withdrawn from the <lb/>brain. <lb/>Gonadectomy and hormone treatment <lb/>Testes were cauterized and removed at the ductus <lb/>deferens via a midline abdominal incision. SILASTIC cap-<lb/>sules (1.5-cm active length; 1.02-mm inner diameter, <lb/>2.16-mm outer diameter; Dow Corning Corporation) were <lb/>filled with crystalline T (Sigma) and inserted subcutane-<lb/>ously between the scapulae after gonadectomy; this pro-<lb/>cedure leads to physiologic levels of T (Barkley and <lb/>Goldman, 1977; Matochik et al., 1994). To further reduce <lb/>aggression in stimulus animals (Beeman, 1947), some <lb/>males were GDX, but did not receive a T implant (GDX). <lb/>The ovaries of stimulus female mice were removed by <lb/>cauterization at the uterine horn and attendant blood <lb/>vessels. SILASTIC capsules (0.7-cm active length; <lb/>1.02-mm inner diameter, 2.16-mm outer diameter; Dow <lb/>Corning Corporation) containing estradiol benzoate (E; <lb/>diluted 1:1 with cholesterol) were implanted subcutane-<lb/>ously in the scapular region immediately following ovari-<lb/>ectomy (GDXϩE; Bakker et al., 2002; Ström et al., 2012). <lb/>To induce sexual receptivity, stimulus females were in-<lb/>jected subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of progesterone (500 <lb/>g dissolved in sesame oil, Sigma) 4 h preceding sexual <lb/>experience, urine collection, and behavioral testing (Vey-<lb/>rac et al., 2011). <lb/>Social experience <lb/>As opposite-sex sexual experience and attaining com-<lb/>petitive status (&quot;social dominance&quot;) promote male and <lb/>female communicative behaviors (Lumley et al., 1999; <lb/>Roullet et al., 2011), mice received social experience over <lb/>five consecutive days (sexual encounters on days 1 and 4, <lb/>aggressive encounters on days 2 and 5, and no encoun-<lb/>ters on day 3). <lb/>Sexual experience <lb/>Subjects were given two opportunities to interact with <lb/>either a stimulus female (for male subjects) or a stimulus <lb/>male (for female subjects). A sexually-experienced stim-<lb/>ulus mouse was placed in the subject&apos;s home cage and <lb/>removed 5 min after one ejaculation or 90 min in the <lb/>absence of ejaculation. Subjects that did not show ejac-<lb/>ulation (two iCre-males) or did not elicit ejaculation (one <lb/>iCreϩ female) on either trial were removed from further <lb/>testing. <lb/>Aggressive experience <lb/>Male subjects were exposed to two interactions with <lb/>subordinate males treated with 40 l of GDXϩT male <lb/>urine applied to their backs. Gonadectomy, group hous-<lb/>ing, and social defeat of our subordinates reduce offen-<lb/>sive aggression in mice, while GDXϩT male urine <lb/>provides subjects with a male urinary cue that elicits <lb/>offensive aggression (Beeman, 1947; Connor and Win-<lb/>ston, 1972; Van Loo et al., 2001). Subordinate stimulus <lb/>males were placed in the subject&apos;s home cage and re-<lb/>moved after the subject&apos;s first offensive attack (biting) <lb/>within a 10-min period. All subject males attacked the <lb/>intruder male stimulus by the second encounter, and all <lb/>subordinate stimulus males displayed submissive behav-<lb/>ior, defined as defensive postures (e.g., on-back), fleeing, <lb/>and non-social exploring (Koolhaas et al., 2013). Female <lb/>subjects were exposed to a female intruder; however, this <lb/>did not elicit any attacks from either animal. <lb/>Experimental procedure <lb/>All testing occurred within the first 6 h of the dark cycle <lb/>under red light illumination, with the exception of the <lb/>elevated plus maze (EPM). All tests were scored by an <lb/>experimenter blind to the genotype of the subject. Three <lb/>to four weeks after viral injections, subjects were habitu-<lb/>ated to the testing room and apparatus by handling and <lb/>placing mice (for 5 min) in the three-chamber apparatus <lb/>(see below) each day for 3 d. On experimental days, <lb/>subjects were adapted to the experimental room for 15 <lb/>min before testing. First, we tested mice on an EPM to <lb/>test for anxiety-related behavior (Lister, 1987).

			<body>secutive days with a day off on the fourth day. Lastly, odor <lb/>discrimination, copulatory, and aggressive behavior were <lb/>measured in the subject&apos;s home cage (Fig. 1A). Female <lb/>subjects were tested irrespective of estrous cycle day, <lb/>except during copulation testing, when they were in be-<lb/>havioral estrus. Prior research indicates minimal effects of <lb/>estrous cycle on female mouse communicative behavior <lb/>(Maggio and Whitney, 1985; Coquelin, 1992; Moncho-<lb/>Bogani et al., 2004). Following testing, subjects were <lb/>killed and their brain tissue was processed for in situ <lb/>hybridization to detect AVP expression in BNST and <lb/>nearby hypothalamic areas. <lb/>Social behavior <lb/>USV, UM, and social investigation were recorded in an <lb/>acrylic three-chamber apparatus (Crawley, 2007; Ara-<lb/>kawa et al., 2008a; Moy et al., 2009; Harvard Apparatus; <lb/>dimensions: 20.3 ϫ 42 ϫ 22 cm). Instead of a solid floor, <lb/>the apparatus was placed on absorbent paper (Nalgene <lb/>Versi-dry paper, Thermo Fisher Scientific) so as to accu-<lb/>rately measure UM. Animals were also tracked using <lb/>motion detection software (ANY-maze, San Diego Instru-<lb/>ments, RRID:SCR_014289). During testing with stimulus <lb/>animals, subjects had access to either a stimulus animal <lb/>in a cage [8 cm (D), 18 cm (H); 3-mm diameter steel bars, <lb/>7.4 mm spacing] or an empty cage placed at opposite <lb/>corners of the outermost chambers of the apparatus. For <lb/>testing with social odors, subjects had access to 50 l of <lb/>fresh urine from a stimulus animal or 50-l saline pipetted <lb/>onto a clean piece of filter paper (3 cm 2 ), that was taped <lb/>on the outside of cages. The location of stimulus and the <lb/>&quot;clean&quot; cage were counterbalanced across animals. After <lb/>placing the subject in the center of the middle chamber, <lb/>we measured, across a 5-min trial, close investigation of <lb/>clean and stimulus cages, distance traveled throughout <lb/>the apparatus, time spent in the stimulus and clean cage <lb/>chambers as well as USVs and UMs. After testing, the <lb/>apparatus and cages were thoroughly cleaned with 70% <lb/>ethanol and allowed to dry before further testing. In all <lb/>cases, urine stimulus from one sex was presented first <lb/>followed by a live stimulus of that same sex; this order <lb/>was then repeated for the opposite sex. In this fashion, <lb/>mice experienced first weak (urine) then stronger social <lb/>stimuli (stimulus animal; the order of male and female <lb/>stimuli presentation was counterbalanced. <lb/>Investigation and USVs <lb/>Close investigation was defined as time spent sniffing <lb/>within 2 cm of the stimulus or clean cage; climbing on the <lb/>cage was not scored as investigation. USVs were de-<lb/>tected using a condenser microphone connected to an <lb/>amplifier (UltraSoundGate CM16/CMPA, 10 -200 kHz, fre-<lb/>quency range) placed 4 cm inside the apparatus and <lb/>directly above the center compartment. USVs were sam-<lb/>pled at 200 kHz (16-bit) with target frequency set to 70 <lb/>kHz (UltraSoundGate 116Hb, Avisoft Bioacoustics). Re-<lb/>cordings were then analyzed using a MATLAB (Math-<lb/>Works, RRID:SCR_001622) plug-in that automates USV <lb/>analysis (Van Segbroeck et al., 2017). Using this program, <lb/>sonograms were generated by calculating the power <lb/>spectrum on Hamming windowed data and then trans-<lb/>formed into compact acoustic feature representations <lb/>(Gammatone Filterbank). Each 200-ms window containing <lb/>the maximum USV syllable duration was then clustered, <lb/>via machine learning algorithms, into USV syllable types <lb/>(repertoire units) based on time-frequency USV shape. <lb/>Repertoire units that appeared as background noise were <lb/>discarded. We counted the number of all USV produced <lb/>by each subject. USV syllable types were identified from a <lb/>subset of males (iCre-n ϭ 6; iCreϩ n ϭ 7) using criterion <lb/>previously described: short, composite, downward, up-<lb/>ward, 1 frequency jump, modulated, multiple frequency <lb/>jumps, u-shape, flat, chevron (Hanson and Hurley, 2012). <lb/>UM <lb/>Following testing, the substrate sheet was allowed to <lb/>dry for 1 h and then sprayed with ninhydrin fixative (LC-<lb/>NIN-16; Tritech Forensics Inc.) to visualize urine marks <lb/>(Meyer, 1957; Lehmann et al., 2013). After 24 h, sheets <lb/>were imaged (Sony DSC-S700 camera), binarized and <lb/>analyzed using a computer-aided imaging software (Im-<lb/>ageJ, RRID:SCR_003070). UM was measured as the total <lb/>area (cm 2 ) of visualized ninhydrin urine marks in the entire <lb/>arena. Urine marks that were larger than 6 cm 2 and di-<lb/>rected toward corners were counted as eliminative <lb/>&quot;pools&quot; and were counted separately (Bishop and Chev-<lb/>ins, 1987). <lb/>Copulatory and aggressive behavior <lb/>To measure copulatory behavior, the stimulus mouse <lb/>was placed in the subject&apos;s home cage and then removed <lb/>5 min after one ejaculation had occurred or if 90 min had <lb/>elapsed without copulation.

To measure territorial aggression, <lb/>subordinate stimulus males were placed in the subject&apos;s <lb/>home cage and then removed after the subject&apos;s first <lb/>offensive attack (biting) within a 10-min period; the latency <lb/>to first bite was recorded. <lb/>continued <lb/>0.29). iCre-(n ϭ 13) and iCreϩ (n ϭ 10) males and iCre-(n ϭ 13) and iCreϩ (n ϭ 8) females.

			<body>Odor discrimination <lb/>We used a habituation-discrimination procedure on a <lb/>subset of subjects to test whether they could distinguish <lb/>between social odors (Baum and Keverne, 2002). Sub-<lb/>jects were given five consecutive 2-min presentations of <lb/>an odor stimulus with one min intervals between presen-<lb/>tations. Subjects were first presented with deionized wa-<lb/>ter, followed by two non-social odors (100% almond, <lb/>lemon, or vanilla extract, Frontier Natural Products), and <lb/>then two urine samples (one from each sex) within their <lb/>home cage. The sequence of odor presentation was <lb/>counterbalanced within non-social or social odor cate-<lb/>gory. Each odor stimulus (30 l) was placed onto a clean <lb/>piece of filter paper (3 cm 2 ) taped to an empty food <lb/>hopper such that subjects could contact the urine sam-<lb/>ples. Time spent sniffing within 2 cm of the filter paper <lb/>was recorded. Food hoppers were cleaned with 70% <lb/>ethanol and allowed to dry between each odor presenta-<lb/>tion. <lb/>EPM <lb/>The EPM consisted of two open arms (30 ϫ 5 cm) and <lb/>two closed arms (30 ϫ 25 ϫ 5 cm) crossed perpendicu-<lb/>larly and raised 60 cm above the floor. Subjects were <lb/>placed at the arm intersection facing the open arm and <lb/>were allowed to habituate to the apparatus for 1 min; <lb/>subjects were then observed for an additional 5 min. <lb/>Animals were tracked by ANY-maze so that measure-<lb/>ments of time spent in open and closed arms were re-<lb/>corded automatically whereas the number of risk <lb/>assessment behaviors (stretch-attend posture, head-<lb/>dips) were manually scored from video (Cole and Rodg-<lb/>ers, 1993). <lb/>Urine collection <lb/>Pooled urine samples were collected from stimulus <lb/>females induced into estrus and from stimulus males (five <lb/>to eight mice per sample). Estrous state was verified by <lb/>color, swelling, and expanded size of vaginal opening <lb/>(Caligioni, 2009). To collect urine, mice were picked up by <lb/>the tail base and held by dorsal neck skin; this method <lb/>was often sufficient to induce urination. If the mouse did <lb/>not urinate, stroking its belly from an anterior to posterior <lb/>direction stimulated bladder voiding. Each mouse pro-<lb/>vided 15-50 l of urine that was pooled into a 1.5-ml <lb/>Eppendorf tube. Urine samples were used fresh within 1 h <lb/>of collection to prevent chemosignal degradation (Roullet <lb/>et al., 2011). <lb/>Histology and in situ hybridization <lb/>Following testing, subjects were killed via CO 2 asphyx-<lb/>iation. Brains were extracted and flash frozen via submer-<lb/>sion in 2-methyl-2-butanol (Sigma) for 10 -20 s and stored <lb/>at Ϫ80°C until sectioned. Coronal sections (20 m) were <lb/>cut with a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems) <lb/>into three series and stored at Ϫ80°C. All tissue was <lb/>handled in a RNase-free environment. Tissue was post-<lb/>fixed in paraformaldehyde, followed by a wash in 2ϫ <lb/>saline-sodium citrate (SSC) and acetylation in a trietha-<lb/>nolamine/acetic anhydride solution, rinsed in dH 2 O, <lb/>washed in acetone/methanol solutions (1:1), and again in <lb/>2ϫ SSC. Tissue was first incubated at 65°C in hybridiza-<lb/>tion buffer (50% deionized formamide, 1% yeast tRNA, <lb/>10% dextran sulphate, 1ϫ Denhardt&apos;s solution, 5% 20ϫ <lb/>SSC) for 30 min before probe application. Riboprobes <lb/>were developed from linearized PK Bluescript SK(ϩ) with <lb/>inserted mouse-vasopressin gene (NM_027106.4, Gen-<lb/>script) using digoxygenin (DIG)-conjugated uracil. Ribo-<lb/>probe synthesized from this plasmid was added to <lb/>hybridization buffer at a concentration of 100 ng/100 l <lb/>and denatured at 90°C for 5 min. Tissue was then hybrid-<lb/>ized at 65°C for 24 h in a humid chamber. The tissue was <lb/>then subjected to two 10-min washes in 2ϫ SSC at room <lb/>temperature followed by a 15-min digestion with RNase A <lb/>(10 g/ml in 2ϫ SSC) at 37°C. This was followed by a <lb/>30-min 2ϫ SSC wash at 56°C and two 10-min 2ϫ SSC <lb/>washes at room temperature. The tissue was then <lb/>quenched in 1% H 2 O 2 in 1ϫ SSC for 15 min, rinsed twice <lb/>in 1ϫ SSC with 0.1% Tween followed by one 5-min TBS <lb/>(20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) wash. Blocking <lb/>solution (normal sheep serum and bovine caesin) was <lb/>applied and tissue was incubated for 30 min followed by <lb/>a 2-h, room temperature incubation with anti-DIG-HRP <lb/>(1:200, Roche Applied Sciences). Unbound antibody was <lb/>washed away with three 10-min washes in TBS-T (0.05% <lb/>Tween in TBS). DIG-labeled probe signal was amplified <lb/>and visualized using a TSA Plus Fluorescein kit (PerkinEl-<lb/>mer) by incubating sections in a 1:50 dilution of the Flu-<lb/>orescein working solution for 12 min followed by three <lb/>10-min washes in TBS. Tissue was then cover-slipped <lb/>using Prolong Gold (Life Technologies) for subsequent <lb/>imaging and tissue analysis. Tissue processed using <lb/>sense RNA probe generated no specific labeling. A subset <lb/>of brain sections was Nissl stained to determine whether <lb/>viral vector injections resulted in a non-specific loss of <lb/>BNST cells. <lb/>Tissue analysis <lb/>Bilateral images were taken at 10ϫ magnification using <lb/>a Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microim-<lb/>aging), which transferred fluorescent images (FITC <lb/>contrast reflector) to image analysis software (Stereo In-<lb/>vestigator, MicroBrightField, RRID:SCR_002526). Imag-<lb/>ing domains (2 mm 2 ) were placed with reference to <lb/>anatomic landmarks (ventricles, fiber tracts; Paxinos and <lb/>Franklin, 2012). Fluorescently labeled AVP mRNA-<lb/>expressing cells were counted in the BNST in both hemi-<lb/>spheres and averaged over three sections covering the <lb/>extent of the AVP cell population in the BNST. In addition, <lb/>we counted nearby accessory AVP mRNA expressing <lb/>cells (Rood and De Vries, 2011) as well as average label <lb/>intensity for AVP mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of <lb/>the hypothalamus (PVN; ImageJ) to determine any possi-<lb/>ble off-target effects of our injections. Although we <lb/>counted AVP mRNA-expressing cells in the PVN as well, <lb/>AVP mRNA label intensity was chosen as the preferred <lb/>method for quantification due to the difficulty of discrim-<lb/>inating between overlapping AVP cells in PVN. Lastly, we <lb/>Nissl stained and imaged BNST tissue at 20ϫ magnifica-<lb/>tion to confirm no significant cell loss. <lb/></body>

			<body>Statistical analysis <lb/>All data were analyzed and graphed in R (3.4.4; R Core <lb/>Team, 2017). Histology, social investigation, movement, <lb/>UM (in male subjects), odor discrimination, and EPM <lb/>data met the assumptions of parametric statistical tests. <lb/>Therefore, we analyzed histologic data with t tests and <lb/>data on social investigation, movement (distance traveled, <lb/>time in chambers containing stimulus and clean cages) <lb/>and male UM with mixed-model ANOVAs [between-<lb/>subject factor: genotype (iCreϩ, iCre-); within-subject <lb/>factors: sex of stimulus (male, female); preference for <lb/>stimulus (stimulus, clean) followed by t tests assessing <lb/>genotype effects]. Total distance traveled within the ap-<lb/>paratus was analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA <lb/>(between-subject factor: genotype; within-subject factor: <lb/>sex of stimulus) as was time spent in open/closed arms in <lb/>the EPM test (between-subject factor: genotype; within-<lb/>subject factor: arm); effects of genotype on additional <lb/>anxiety behaviors (stretch-attend, head-dips) were ana-<lb/>lyzed using t tests. We determined whether subjects <lb/>could discriminate between odors by comparing odor <lb/>investigation on the last trial for one odor and odor investi-<lb/>gation on the first trial of the subsequent odor using paired t <lb/>tests. The number of female UMs, USVs, USV syllable type, <lb/>measures of copulatory behavior, and aggression behavior <lb/>were not normally distributed and could not be transformed, <lb/>therefore, we analyzed genotype effects using pairwise <lb/>Mann-Whitney U tests. Differences in proportion of animals <lb/>engaging in copulatory/aggressive behaviors across geno-<lb/>type was assessed using 2 tests. All post hoc pairwise <lb/>comparisons report Bonferroni-corrected p values and Co-<lb/>hen&apos;s d for effect size when statistically significant. Results <lb/>were considered significant if p Ͻ 0.05. All statistical tests <lb/>are presented in Table 1. <lb/>Results <lb/>Histology <lb/>Injection of a viral vector encoding a Cre-dependent <lb/>cell-death construct into the BNST highly effectively re-<lb/>duced AVP cell numbers in both iCreϩ males and fe-<lb/>males, which had only 10% of the number found in iCre-<lb/>subjects (males: t (22) ϭ 4.57, p ϭ 0.00014, d ϭ 2.64; <lb/>females: t (19) ϭ 3.58, p ϭ 0.0025, d ϭ 2.02; Fig. 1B), <lb/>without significantly reducing the number of nearby ac-<lb/>cessory AVP mRNA-expressing cells (males: t (22) ϭ -0.16, <lb/>p ϭ 0.98; females: t (19) ϭ -0.15, p ϭ 0.89; Fig. 1C) or total <lb/>level of AVP mRNA label in the PVN (males: t (20) ϭ 0.66, p <lb/>ϭ 0.947; females: t (19) ϭ -1.10, p ϭ 0.29; Fig. 1D), sug-<lb/>gesting that there were no significant off-target effects. <lb/>We also observed no difference in the number of AVP <lb/>mRNA-expressing cells in the PVN between genotype <lb/>female <lb/>male <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>time (s) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>time (s) <lb/>female <lb/>male <lb/>e <lb/>n <lb/>i <lb/>r <lb/>U <lb/>: <lb/>s <lb/>u <lb/>l <lb/>u <lb/>m <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>S <lb/>l <lb/>a <lb/>m <lb/>i <lb/>n <lb/>A <lb/>: <lb/>s <lb/>u <lb/>l <lb/>u <lb/>m <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>S <lb/>male <lb/>subject <lb/>female <lb/>subject <lb/>A <lb/>B <lb/>C <lb/>D <lb/>** <lb/>female <lb/>male <lb/>0 <lb/>25 <lb/>50 <lb/>75 <lb/>100 <lb/>time (s) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>time (s) <lb/>iCre− stimulus <lb/>iCre− clean <lb/>iCre+ stimulus <lb/>iCre+ clean <lb/>female <lb/>male <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>ropeptidergic cells has caused a sex difference in mam-<lb/>malian social responses. While several studies have <lb/>directly tested the social function of sexually-dimorphic <lb/>cell populations (Yang et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2015; <lb/>Unger et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2018), only one has found a <lb/>strong sex difference in social behavior tied to an ana-<lb/>tomic sexual dimorphism, in this case a female-biased <lb/>one (Scott et al., 2015). Our results indicate that sex <lb/>differences in AVP cells in the BNST contributes to sex-<lb/>ually dimorphic components of social communication. <lb/>Our experiments do not allow us to conclude that re-<lb/>moval of AVP production in the BNST, by and of itself, <lb/>caused the behavioral effects observed in this study. <lb/>Lesioning AVP cells also removed all other neuroactive <lb/>substances co-expressed by these cells, for example, <lb/>galanin (Miller et al., 1993), which also has been impli-<lb/>cated in control of social behavior (Wu et al., 2014). <lb/>Consequently, our behavioral results may be due to <lb/>depletion of AVP, or of co-transmitters from BNST pro-<lb/>jections, or both. Our finding of reduced male-male inves-<lb/>tigation following BNST AVP cell deletion, however, is <lb/>strikingly similar to the effects of RNA interference for the <lb/>homologous peptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in the BNST <lb/>of territorial finches (Kelly and Goodson, 2013b) and sug-<lb/>gests that this effect is mainly due to a reduction of AVP <lb/>signal from the BNST. <lb/>Our cell deletion approach is, by design, permanent, <lb/>and so behavioral effects may reflect molecular, cellular, <lb/>and anatomic adjustments or compensations to chronic <lb/>depletion of AVP cells in the BNST. Indeed, long-term <lb/>pharmacological reduction of V1a receptor activity in the <lb/>LS, a key target of AVP cells in the BNST (De Vries and <lb/>Panzica, 2006), produces different changes in behavior <lb/>than acute receptor blockade (Liebsch et al., 1996; Everts <lb/>and Koolhaas, 1999). A lack of an effect on a behavior, <lb/>therefore, does not exclude involvement of these cells in <lb/>that behavior. Nevertheless, our findings of male-specific <lb/>alterations in social interactions and communication fol-<lb/>lowing deletion of AVP cells in the BNST strongly indicate <lb/>that in males these cells are critical for these functions. <lb/>One of the strongest effects of deletion of AVP cells in <lb/>the BNST was the reduction of same-sex social investi-<lb/>gation, which we found in males but not in females. <lb/>Importantly, this reduction was not due to a lack of gen-<lb/>eral social interest, as investigation of females was <lb/>unchanged. It was not due to changes in general chemo-<lb/>sensory function or motor behavior either, as odor habit-<lb/>uation or discrimination of non-social odors and detection <lb/>of social odors (male or female urine) was unaffected and <lb/>measures of general activity were also not changed. This <lb/>reduction can also not be explained by a general increase <lb/>in anxiety-like behaviors, because the lesions did not <lb/>affect behavior in the anxiogenic EPM. Instead, it sug-<lb/>gests that one function of AVP cells in the BNST is to <lb/>generate male-typical approach, investigation, and as-<lb/>sessment of potential territorial competitors (Oldfield <lb/>et al., 2015), which is consistent with the observation that <lb/>knocking down AVT mRNA in the BNST of territorial birds <lb/>reduces social contact with other males (Kelly and Good-<lb/>son, 2013b), and that overexpression of V1a receptors <lb/>(Landgraf et al., 2003) or AVP injections (Koolhaas et al., <lb/>1991) in the LS, a key target for AVP projections from the <lb/>BNST (De Vries and Panzica, 2006), increases active <lb/>male-male interactions and aggressive behavior in rats. <lb/>Indeed, retrodialysis of V1aR antagonist into the LS of <lb/>male rats blocks further territorial aggression during re-<lb/>peated resident-intruder tests (Veenema et al., 2010). Our <lb/>finding that deleting AVP cells in the BNST reduced in-<lb/>vestigation of potential competitors is consistent with <lb/>these findings. Our failure to see a change in aggressive <lb/>behavior is not. One explanation for this apparent discrep-<lb/>ancy is that AVP from other sources contribute to stimu-<lb/>lating effects on aggressive behavior in areas such as the <lb/>LS. For example, AVP cells in the MeA show similar <lb/>dimorphisms as BNST cells and project to overlapping <lb/>areas (De Vries and Panzica, 2006).

			<body>groups may be necessary to identify all behaviors in which <lb/>these sexually dimorphic cell groups are critically in-<lb/>volved. Nevertheless, AVP cells in the BNST appear to be <lb/>required for the proactive investigation of credible social <lb/>threats rather than for offensive aggression per se. <lb/>Ablation of AVP cells in the BNST of male, but not <lb/>female, mice strongly increased UM toward females, sug-<lb/>gesting that these cells normally suppress male scent <lb/>marking toward females. This increase in UM is not due to <lb/>excessive eliminative urination because it was not ob-<lb/>served toward male stimuli nor was it manifested as an <lb/>increase in pooled urine. It is possible that this increase is <lb/>simply due to increased proximity and interest in females. <lb/>However, males with deletions of AVP cells in the BNST <lb/>did not differ from control animals in time spent investi-<lb/>gating female stimuli, making this explanation less likely. <lb/>Although UM strongly depends on chemosensory pro-<lb/>cessing (Maruniak et al., 1986; Labov and Wysocki, 1989), <lb/>the increase in UM by lesioned males was not driven <lb/>primarily by female urine cues because marking to female <lb/>urine was not increased, suggesting that other cues, che-<lb/>mosensory as well as non-chemosensory, may drive this <lb/>increase in scent marking. Given the metabolic costs of <lb/>urination (Gosling et al., 2000) and the increased risks <lb/>associated with attraction of aggressive competitors and <lb/>predators toward urine marks (Desjardins et al., 1973; <lb/>Figure 8. BNST AVP cell ablations did not change the ability to discriminate between social odors. Time spent investigating water, <lb/>almond or coconut extract, male urine, or female urine.

However, subjects&apos; ability to discriminate between non-social odors was not robust.

			<body>Roberts et al., 2001), UM should be strongly regulated so <lb/>that signaling occurs in only specific social contexts. The <lb/>present results indicate that the BNST-AVP cells may be <lb/>a key part of the neural system that adaptively regulates <lb/>this critical signaling behavior. <lb/>Although AVP/AVT has been implicated in the produc-<lb/>tion of vocalizations across taxa (Goodson and Bass, <lb/>2001), deleting the AVP cells in the BNST did not signifi-<lb/>cantly alter the production of USVs in a reproductive <lb/>context. This is consistent with the few studies examining <lb/>male courtship vocalizations (in birds) that report no effect <lb/>of central infusions of AVT or V1a antagonists on female-<lb/>directed singing (Goodson and Adkins-Regan, 1999; <lb/>Goodson and Evans, 2004) or got mixed results from <lb/>antisense knock-down of BNST-AVP, with one study find-<lb/>ing no effect (Kelly et al., 2011) and another observing <lb/>decreased singing (Kelly and Goodson, 2013b). Most <lb/>other studies supporting a role for AVP/AVT in vocaliza-<lb/>tions have not identified the relevant neuroanatomical <lb/>source of the peptide or its locus of action (Wilczynski <lb/>et al., 2017) or tended to focus on stress-related or ag-<lb/>gressive vocalizations across development (Winslow and <lb/>Insel, 1993; Bleickardt et al., 2009; Iijima et al., 2014; <lb/>Lukas and Wöhr, 2015; Paul et al., 2016; Freeman et al., <lb/>2018). <lb/>Our study also points to a limited, sexually dimorphic <lb/>role of BNST AVP cells in reproductive behavior. Removal <lb/>of these cells in males did not alter copulatory behavior, <lb/>which is consistent with the absence of copulatory defi-<lb/>cits in whole-animal knock-outs of V1a or V1b receptors <lb/>(Wersinger et al., 2004, 2007). However, unexpectedly, <lb/>ablating these cells in females delayed, and reduced the <lb/>number of times they were mounted by males. This effect <lb/>may represent reduced attractiveness of the female or an <lb/>increased rejection of the male. The latter possibility <lb/>seems less likely, as we did not detect any change in male <lb/>investigation toward lesioned females, nor did such fe-<lb/>males reject males more frequently. It is possible that <lb/>these females show decreases in cryptic proceptive <lb/>and/or receptive behaviors. Although AVP has been im-<lb/>plicated in female rat sexual behavior, the pattern of prior <lb/>results is opposite to our findings: in rats, AVP reduced, <lb/>whereas V1a receptor antagonists increased, female sex-<lb/>ual behavior in rats (Södersten et al., 1983; Pedersen and <lb/>Boccia, 2006). However, as in these studies peptides <lb/>were injected into the lateral ventricle, it is unclear with <lb/>what AVP system they interacted. <lb/>Although central AVP has been repeatedly implicated in <lb/>the generation of anxiety states (Ebner et al., 2002; Biel-<lb/>sky et al., 2004; Raggenbass, 2008), we did not observe <lb/>changes in anxiety-like behavior of lesioned males or <lb/>females in a non-social anxiogenic environment (Hogg, <lb/>1996). This is somewhat surprising because AVP in the <lb/>LS, an important target of the BNST AVP cells (De Vries <lb/>and Panzica, 2006), controls anxious states. For example, <lb/>injections of AVP or V1aR antagonists, or V1aR knock-<lb/>down within LS all support the idea that AVP is anxiogenic <lb/>at this site (Landgraf et al., 1995; Liebsch et al., 1996; <lb/>Beiderbeck et al., 2007). However, since large lesions of <lb/>BNST have no effect on anxiety-like behavior in the EPM <lb/>task either (Treit et al., 1998), it may simply mean that, as <lb/>with aggressive behavior, AVP cells in the BNST are not <lb/>critically involved in anxiety-like behaviors, and that AVP <lb/>derived from other sources, such as the PVN or the <lb/>amygdala (Rood et al., 2013), also drive AVP&apos;s anxiogenic <lb/>action in the septum and elsewhere. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>A growing body of literature indicates that vasopressin <lb/>plays a sexually dimorphic role in control of social and <lb/>anxiety-related behaviors. In humans, for example, intra-<lb/>nasal vasopressin stimulates reciprocation of cooperation <lb/>in males and conciliatory behavior in females, while acti-<lb/>vating brain areas implicated in reward, social bonding, <lb/>arousal and memory in males, but not in females (Rilling <lb/>et al., 2014). In hamsters, hypothalamic injections of va-<lb/>sopressin stimulate aggression in males, while reducing it <lb/>in females (Terranova et al., 2016). In mice, a genetic <lb/>knock-out of the vasopressin V1a receptor gene reduces <lb/>anxiety-related behaviors in males, but not in females <lb/>(Bielsky et al., 2004, 2005). In rats, a V1a antagonist <lb/>reduces social play in males while increasing them in <lb/>females when injected intracerebroventricularly, but has <lb/>the exact opposite effect when injected into the septum <lb/>(Veenema et al., 2013). Although, these studies clearly <lb/>point at a sexually dimorphic role of vasopressin and its <lb/>cognate receptor in behavior, they do not identify which <lb/>AVP system is involved, and the opposite effects in play <lb/>behavior, depending on the area injected, suggests that <lb/>more than one system may be involved. By targeting a <lb/>specific AVP cell group directly, our study has identified <lb/>the sexually dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST as contrib-<lb/>uting to sex differences in social behavior, and has shown <lb/>the feasibility of following a similar approach in identifying <lb/>the contributions of other AVP systems in the brain as <lb/>well. <lb/></body>
