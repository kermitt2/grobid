			<front>R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E <lb/>Open Access <lb/>Escherichia coli YmdB regulates biofilm formation <lb/>independently of its role as an RNase III <lb/>modulator <lb/>Taeyeon Kim 1 † , Juyeon Lee 1,2 † and Kwang-sun Kim 1,3* <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: Ribonuclease III (RNase III) activity modulates hundreds of genes in Escherichia coli (E. coli). YmdB, a <lb/>member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of RNase III activity; however, <lb/>the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined. <lb/>YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified <lb/>gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition. <lb/>Results: The expression of &gt;2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated, <lb/>of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly, <lb/>YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III <lb/>inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and <lb/>biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB. <lb/>Conclusions: This is the first global profile of target genes modulated by YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in <lb/>E. coli, and the data reveal a novel, hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for YmdB in biofilm modulation. <lb/>Keywords: Ribonuclease III (RNase III), Microarray, Biofilm, Trans-acting regulator, Escherichia coli <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>RNase III family members cleave double-stranded RNAs <lb/>to yield 5′ phosphate and 3′ hydroxyl termini, and are <lb/>extensively conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes <lb/>[1-7]. During bacterial ribosome biogenesis, RNase III <lb/>processes the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursors [8], <lb/>and also mediates the maturation and/or degradation of <lb/>different types of transcripts [9], small RNAs [10,11], <lb/>and mRNAs containing rnc [12,13] or pnp genes [14]. <lb/>The structural and mechanistic features of RNase III <lb/>have been extensively studied [1-14]; however, questions <lb/>remain concerning the cellular control of RNase III <lb/>activity under different physiological conditions. <lb/>In E. coli, some proteins are known as regulators for <lb/>endo-RNase activity [15-18]. For example, RraA and <lb/>RraB negatively regulate RNase E activity [15,16]. In case <lb/>of RNase III, bacteriophage T7 protein kinase [17] and <lb/>YmdB [18] identified as an either activator or inhibitor of <lb/>RNase III function. The activation process by bacteriophage <lb/>T7 protein kinase is through binding to RNase III and <lb/>phosphorylates the enzyme on serine [17]. YmdB was <lb/>the first RNase III-binding inhibitor to be identified <lb/>in vivo using a novel genetic screening approach and, <lb/>in common with other RNase regulators, YmdB expression <lb/>is modulated by cold-or growth-stress [18]. YmdB, acting <lb/>in concert with other uncharacterized stress-mediated <lb/>trans-acting factors, facilitates the regulation of RNase III <lb/>activity under growth-[18] or osmotic stress conditions <lb/>[19]. Several protein identities are proposed for the <lb/>trans-acting inhibitor(s) and potential targets of their <lb/>inhibition has been suggested; for example, cellular <lb/>targets of RNase III activity, such as the RNase III <lb/>gene itself, rnc [12,13], pnp [14], and rRNA processing by <lb/>YmdB [18] and the level of bdm mRNA encoding a protein <lb/></body>

			<body>that promotes biofilm formation by unknown trans-acting <lb/>factor(s) [19]. The cellular processes required for RNase III <lb/>inhibition by trans-acting factor(s) during stress responses <lb/>are unclear; however, one post-transcriptional pathway <lb/>has been proposed [7], which involves the general <lb/>stress-responsive regulator, RpoS [20]. By cleaving the <lb/>rpoS mRNA 5′-leader [21], RNase III reduces RpoS <lb/>production; the presence of YmdB limits this reaction and <lb/>as a consequence, increases RpoS levels, which supports <lb/>entry into the stationary phase [7]. This hypothesis behind <lb/>this process came from a study that used an RNase III <lb/>mutant [21]; however, to clarify and identify new targets of <lb/>RNase III inhibition, it is essential to adopt a model that <lb/>mimics physiological RNase III inhibition via the induction <lb/>of trans-acting factor(s). <lb/>The present study investigated RNase III inhibition via <lb/>the ectopic expression of the regulatory protein, YmdB, <lb/>and identified novel targets of inhibition. We also explored <lb/>the mechanism(s) by which biofilm formation is regulated. <lb/>Gene expression profiling of the entire E. coli open reading <lb/>frame (ORF) following YmdB overexpression was performed <lb/>using DNA microarray analysis, and revealed that ~2,000 <lb/>transcripts were modulated. Of these, 129 genes spanning <lb/>ten cellular processes were strongly modulated by YmdB <lb/>expression. About 40 of these were similarly controlled by <lb/>RNase III, including five novel targets. Moreover, among the <lb/>YmdB-modulated genes, ten are reported to be related to <lb/>biofilm formation, the presence of which is a universal <lb/>feature of bacteria and a component of multicellular <lb/>communities [22]. Biochemical analyses indicate that <lb/>induction of YmdB strongly inhibits biofilm formation <lb/>in a manner similar to that of RpoS, which is a regulator of <lb/>general stress responses [20] and a biofilm inhibitor [23-25]. <lb/>Inhibition occurred via two mechanisms that were either <lb/>dependent or independent of RNase III activity. Genetic <lb/>studies revealed that the YmdB-and RpoS-induced decrease <lb/>in biofilm formation required RpoS and YmdB, respectively. <lb/>In conclusion, we have identified a novel role for YmdB as a <lb/>modulator of biofilm formation, and revealed how a <lb/>trans-acting factor can regulate RNase III activity, as well <lb/>as function independently to enable a rapid response to <lb/>changing cellular needs. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Bacterial strains, plasmids, primers, and growth <lb/>conditions <lb/>Details of the bacterial strains and plasmids used are <lb/>given in Additional file 1: Table S1. Primers used for <lb/>qPCR analysis and DNA sequencing were synthesized by <lb/>Bioneer (Korea) (Additional file 1: Table S2). All estab-<lb/>lished mutant strains or chromosomal lacZ fusions were <lb/>derived from E. coli BW25113. Analysis of rpoS pro-<lb/>moter activity was based on a plasmid, pKSK001, con-<lb/>taining promoter region −92 to +10 of the rpoS gene <lb/>from the E. coli K12 genome (GenBank U00096.2) sub-<lb/>cloned into the lacZ transcriptional fusion vector, <lb/>pSP417 [26], after linearization by EcoRI/BamHI. The <lb/>lacZ fusion in pKSK001 was recombined onto the <lb/>chromosome (KSK003) using the transducing λ phage <lb/>system, λRS45 [27], via a double recombination event <lb/>and was verified as previously described [18]. Strain <lb/>ΔymdB was constructed by eliminating the kana-<lb/>mycin cassette (ymdB::km R ) from Keio-ΔymdB as de-<lb/>scribed previously [28]. Verification of Keio-ΔymdB [28], <lb/>ΔymdB (KSK002), Keio-ΔrpoS [28], or rnc14•Keio-ΔrpoS <lb/>(KSK005) was carried out by colony PCR using primer <lb/>pairs ymdB-F/-R or rpoS-F/-R and Emerald PCR premix <lb/>(Takara) (Additional file 1: Figure S1), and the PCR <lb/>products were read by DNA sequencing analysis using <lb/>the same primers (data not shown). Verification of <lb/>RNase III mutation was confirmed by Western blot ana-<lb/>lysis using antibodies against RNase III (Additional file <lb/>1: Figure S1). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) <lb/>broth or on LB plates at 37°C throughout this study. An-<lb/>tibiotics were used at the following concentrations: <lb/>kanamycin, 50 μg/mL; tetracycline, 10 μg/mL; and chlor-<lb/>amphenicol, 30 μg/mL. <lb/>Microarray analysis <lb/>Total RNA was extracted from IPTG (0.1 mM final con-<lb/>centration)-induced E. coli BW25113 cells (at an OD 600 <lb/>of 1.0) containing either pCA24N (−gfp) or ASKA-ymdB <lb/>(−) using an RNeasy® Kit (Qiagen) with two additional <lb/>DNase treatments. The integrity of the bacterial total RNA <lb/>was checked by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The cDNA <lb/>probes were prepared by reverse transcription with random <lb/>priming of total RNA (25 μg) in the presence of aminoallyl-<lb/>dUTP for 3 h, followed by coupling of probes with Cy3 dye <lb/>(for the reference) or Cy5 dye (for the test sample) (AP Bio-<lb/>tech). The Cy3-or Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were purified, <lb/>dried, and resuspended in hybridization buffer containing <lb/>30% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/mL salmon <lb/>sperm DNA. The cDNA probes were mixed together and <lb/>hybridized to customized microarray slides (E. coli K12 3 × <lb/>15 K microarray; www.Mycroarray.com). The image of the <lb/>slide was scanned with a GenePix 4000B (Axon Instru-<lb/>ments, USA) and analyzed by GenePix Pro 3.0 software <lb/>(Axon Instruments) to obtain the gene expression ratios <lb/>(reference vs. test sample). Microarray data analysis was <lb/>performed using Genowiz 4.0™ (Ocimum Biosolutions). <lb/>Global lowess (Locally weighted scatter plot smoothing) <lb/>method was used for data normalization. The cut-off values <lb/>for up-or down-regulated genes in duplicate hybridizations <lb/>were 1.5-or 0.6-fold, respectively. <lb/>RT-qPCR analysis <lb/>The E. coli strains listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 <lb/>were grown in LB medium to an OD 600 of 1.0, and the <lb/></body>

The results are expressed as the means of three inde-<lb/>pendent experiments. <lb/>Protein gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis <lb/>Overexpression of the YmdB and RpoS proteins was <lb/>detected on Coomassie blue-stained 12% Mini-<lb/>PROTEAN TGX Precast gels (Bio-Rad). Western <lb/>blots for RNase III, YmdB, RpoS, or 6x Histidine-<lb/>tagged YmdB were prepared as described [18], probed <lb/>with antibodies (1:2,500 dilution) against YmdB, <lb/>RNase III [18], RpoS (1RS1: Santa Cruz Biotechnol-<lb/>ogy), or 6x Histidine-tagged YmdB (6xHis Epitope <lb/>Tag Antibody: Thermo Scientific) and developed with <lb/>Clarity™ western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad). To normalize the <lb/>signals, antibodies against S1 protein [34] was used as a <lb/>reference probe (1:100,000 dilution). Anti-rabbit IgG: <lb/>HRP or anti-mouse IgG:HRP conjugates (Promega; 1:5000 <lb/>dilution) were used for YmdB/RNase III/S1 proteins or <lb/>RpoS/6xHistidine tagged YmdB, respectively. Specific pro-<lb/>teins were imaged using MyECL and quantified with <lb/>myImage Analysis software (Thermo Scientific). <lb/>Results <lb/>Analysis of the E. coli transcriptome under conditions <lb/>mimicking those of an RNase III mutant <lb/>To identify which pathways and related genes are me-<lb/>diated by YmdB-modulated RNase III inhibition, a <lb/>genome-wide analysis of mRNA abundance at single <lb/>gene resolution was performed. In these experiments, <lb/>total steady-state RNA extracted from IPTG-induced <lb/>exponentially grown cells expressing either ASKA-<lb/>ymdB (a part of the ASKA (−) library: a complete set <lb/>of cloned individual E. coli genes encoding proteins <lb/>with 6x histidines at the N-terminal end and no GFP <lb/>fusion at the C-terminal end [35]); or pCA24N (a <lb/>control vector without GFP at the C-terminal end) <lb/>[29] were analyzed on customized ORF microarray <lb/>chips. Duplicate arrays were performed with biological rep-<lb/>licates to minimize experimental artifacts, and the gene ex-<lb/>pression profiles of 4,289 genes were averaged and <lb/>analyzed. YmdB overexpression modulated the relative <lb/>abundance of more than 2,000 transcripts (data not shown). <lb/>Of these, 129 genes were strongly regulated (changes in ex-<lb/>pression of either &gt;1.5 or &lt;0.6 fold) (Additional file 1: <lb/>Table S3). YmdB was previously identified as an RNase III <lb/>regulator [18]; thus, we examined the number of YmdB-<lb/>modulated genes that were related to the down-regulation <lb/>of RNase III activity to identify RNase III/YmdB-regulatory <lb/>genes. The microarray data related to YmdB overexpression <lb/>were compared with the tiling array data for an RNase III <lb/>mutant [36], in which 592 genes were affected by the <lb/>absence of RNase III. Of 127 coding genes from the <lb/>tiling array data, 47 are known RNase III targets and, <lb/>of these, 37 were similarly regulated by YmdB and the <lb/>RNase III mutant (Additional file 1: Table S3). This sug-<lb/>gests that YmdB modulates these genes by down-<lb/>regulating RNase III activity. However, 80 genes that <lb/>were not previously regarded as RNase III targets also <lb/>appeared to be modulated via an as yet uncharacterized <lb/>YmdB function(s). When the 80 genes were classified ac-<lb/>cording to the biological process in which they are in-<lb/>volved, we identified ten different cellular processes that <lb/>were modulated by YmdB induction (Table 1). Therefore, <lb/>the data indicate that YmdB, either as an RNase III regula-<lb/>tor or by itself, participates in the regulation of multiple <lb/>cellular processes within E. coli. <lb/>Identification of new RNase III targets regulated by YmdB <lb/>Using the results shown in Additional file 1: Table S3, <lb/>genes that showed the highest changes in expression <lb/>(&gt;2-fold change) were selected for quantification by real-<lb/>time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). These genes com-<lb/>prised confirmed (mltD, pnp, plsX, and ahpF) [14,36] <lb/>and unconfirmed (pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, and ahpC) <lb/>RNase III targets. For all known RNase III-target genes, <lb/>increased expression was observed in the RNase III <lb/>mutant (rnc14), which correlated with the YmdB <lb/>overexpression data (Table 2).

			<body>knockout, further indicating that these genes might <lb/>be new RNase III targets regulated by YmdB. <lb/>Identification of YmdB as a protein that inhibits biofilm <lb/>formation <lb/>The results obtained thus far suggest a role for YmdB in <lb/>biofilm synthesis. Ten genes related to biofilm formation <lb/>[37-40] were modulated by YmdB overexpression <lb/>(Table 1); in particular, genes induced within the biofilm <lb/>were strongly upregulated, including rpoE [41] and <lb/>pspABCDE [41,42]. Additionally, rpoS and bdm, both <lb/>known targets of RNase III and related to either the <lb/>down-or up-regulation of biofilm formation [19,21,36], <lb/>were upregulated (by ~1.5-and 1.8-fold, respectively). <lb/>To investigate this further, biofilm formation by <lb/>BW25113 cells containing either pCA24N (−gfp) or <lb/>ASKA-ymdB (−) was measured after 24 h of growth <lb/>without agitation in LB containing different concentra-<lb/>tions of IPTG (0 to 0.1 mM). Compared with cells har-<lb/>boring the control vector, increased expression of YmdB <lb/>inhibited biofilm formation by up to 80% in the presence <lb/>or absence of IPTG (Figure 1A). The effect was linearly <lb/>correlated with IPTG concentration (10 -6 to 10 -1 mM), <lb/>with no further reduction observed above 1 mM IPTG <lb/>(data not shown). The physiological relevance of this in-<lb/>hibitory effect of YmdB is shown in Figure 1B. The total <lb/>relative level of YmdB protein was assessed by Western <lb/>Blotting [18] and was found to increase by 2.2-to 5.7-<lb/>fold in the presence of increasing concentrations of <lb/>IPTG (Figure 1B) (increased YmdB expression in the ab-<lb/>sence of IPTG results from the leaky lac promoter in <lb/>the ASKA plasmids) [35]. The changes in YmdB levels <lb/>are similar to those observed in vivo following growth-<lb/>or cold-stress (2-to 8-fold) [18] and are thus physiolo-<lb/>gically relevant. <lb/>RNase III does not affect biofilm inhibition by YmdB <lb/>The YmdB protein regulates RNase III activity through <lb/>the formation through the proposed formation of an <lb/>RNase III/YmdB heterocomplex [18]; hence, it was im-<lb/>portant to clarify whether the biofilm phenotype mediated by <lb/>ectopic expression of YmdB is similar to that mediated by <lb/>RNase III inhibition. Biofilm formation in the absence of <lb/>RNase III (rnc14) increased by ~52% (Figure 2A), implying <lb/>that inhibition of biofilm formation is independent of <lb/>RNase III/YmdB heterocomplex, and that an alternative, <lb/>hitherto uncharacterized, function of YmdB exists. To <lb/>verify this possibility, we measured the inhibition of <lb/>biofilm formation in the presence of YmdB overexpression <lb/>(confirmed in Figure 2B) against an rnc + and rnc14 <lb/>background. The results showed that inhibition was <lb/>almost the same between the wild-type strain (~70%) <lb/>and the strain lacking RNase III (~67%) (Figure 2A). <lb/>By contrast, processing of pnp&apos;-&apos;lacZ mRNA, a known target <lb/>for YmdB-mediated inhibition of RNase III activity [18], is <lb/>fully dependent on RNase III (Additional file 1: Figure S2). <lb/>Taken together, these results indicate that YmdB over-<lb/>expression inhibits biofilm formation via an RNase <lb/>III-independent pathway. <lb/>RpoS is required for the inhibition of biofilm formation <lb/>by YmdB <lb/>While it was clear that YmdB induction decreased <lb/>biofilm formation (Figure 1), biofilm formation also <lb/>decreased by ~35% in the absence of ymdB (ΔymdB) <lb/>gene in the chromosome (Figure 3A).

			<body>steady-state level of rpoS transcript (Figure 4C) was <lb/>oppositely regulated in the absence of chromosomal <lb/>ymdB. Additionally, the level of rpoS transcript following <lb/>YmdB overexpression was lower than that in the RNase <lb/>III mutant strain. These data suggest that YmdB-mediated <lb/>regulation of RNase III activity alone cannot fully regulate <lb/>the processing of the 5′ UTR of rpoS mRNA. Because <lb/>RpoS can negatively regulate biofilm formation by itself <lb/>(Figure 3B) and is also required for complete YmdB func-<lb/>tion (Figure 3B), it is a matter of debate whether YmdB <lb/>can modulate RpoS activity. When the RpoS protein was <lb/>overexpressed in a wild-type and in an ymdB knockout <lb/>strain, RpoS-mediated inhibition of biofilm formation was <lb/>decreased from 70% to 43% (Figure 3B). This, when taken <lb/>together with the other data, suggests that the regulation <lb/>of RpoS function during biofilm formation is dependent <lb/>upon YmdB. Moreover, RpoS overexpression phenotype <lb/>on biofilm inhibition was not dependent upon the pres-<lb/>ence of RNase III activity (Additional file 1: Figure S3). <lb/>Thus, YmdB is a novel post-transcriptional regulator of <lb/>RpoS levels that acts independently of RNase III. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The results presented herein demonstrate that YmdB is <lb/>a major regulator of RNase III activity in E. coli, modulating <lb/>more than 30% of the genes targeted by RNase III. In <lb/>addition, the results of a microarray analysis following <lb/>YmdB overexpression (which identified changes in biofilm-<lb/>related genes and a decrease in biofilm formation) indicate <lb/>a novel role for YmdB as a modulator of biofilm formation. <lb/>Previous results indicated that overexpression of RpoS was <lb/>associated with decreased biofilm formation [25]. Our <lb/>microarray, qPCR, and Western blotting data showed that <lb/>overexpression of YmdB increased the levels of RpoS <lb/>(Additional file 1: Tables S3, Figures 2, 3 and 4). Moreover, <lb/>YmdB modulated RpoS levels and activity of biofilm <lb/>formation (Figures 3, 4). Thus, we propose a model to <lb/>illustrate the multiple roles played by YmdB during gene <lb/>expression and biofilm formation (Figure 5). <lb/>The 5′ UTR of rpoS mRNA is a known target of <lb/>RNase III and its levels increase when RNase III activity <lb/>is ablated [21]. Because biofilm formation is influenced <lb/>by RpoS levels, it may be proposed that the rpoS mRNA <lb/>is responsive to YmdB-directed RNase III inhibition. <lb/>However, this is not the case because the decrease in <lb/>biofilm formation following YmdB expression was not <lb/>reversed in the absence of RNase III (Figure 2), suggesting <lb/>that regulation of RNase III activity by YmdB is not essen-<lb/>tial for the inhibition of biofilm formation. Thus, the major <lb/>mechanism underlying biofilm regulation by YmdB appears <lb/>to be RNase III-independent (Figure 5). <lb/>A screen of potential regulatory gene(s) with a YmdB-<lb/>mediated phenotype demonstrated that RpoS is necessary <lb/>for inhibiting biofilm formation (Figure 3); RpoS activates <lb/>the transcription of ymdB [18]; thus, it is highly plausible <lb/>that the RpoS gene is an upstream regulator of YmdB <lb/>transcription and the resultant phenotypes. Conversely, <lb/>the possibility that YmdB is a transcription factor that <lb/>activates rpoS transcription was initially suggested by ob-<lb/>servations that RpoS levels were increased by YmdB over-<lb/>expression, and that YmdB and RpoS are both required <lb/>for the decrease in biofilm formation. However, this theory <lb/>was rejected because increases in YmdB expression had no <lb/>effect on promoter activity (data not shown). Hence, <lb/>YmdB-induced modulation of RpoS levels must occur via <lb/>post-transcriptional regulation (Figure 4). It is also possible <lb/>that YmdB modulates other rpoS transcription factor(s), <lb/>although we have not identified which other tran-<lb/>scription factors are required for this response. Over-<lb/>all, the data suggest that YmdB and RpoS are co-<lb/>regulators of biofilm formation (Figure 5). <lb/>The identification of a novel role for YmdB is not <lb/>altogether surprising, since eukaryotic macrodomain <lb/>proteins can have multiple roles [43,44], and YmdB <lb/>has additional functions in bacteria [45,46]. For instance, <lb/>in E. coli YmdB deacetylates the sirtuin product of <lb/>O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and reforms ADP ribose [45]. <lb/>The present study reveals that YmdB modulates the <lb/>expression of genes involved in physiologically important <lb/>pathways (Table 1); hence, YmdB could act as a general <lb/>regulator in a variety of cellular processes. Further examin-<lb/>ation of such a potential role for YmdB and its family <lb/>members in bacteria is necessary. YmdB is also required to <lb/>be coexpressed for the complementation of a function of <lb/>YmdB <lb/>YmdB <lb/>Biofilm <lb/>RNase III <lb/>RpoS <lb/>Unknown <lb/>factor(s) <lb/>RNase III <lb/>Figure 5 A model of biofilm formation and gene <lb/>expression involving YmdB, RpoS, and RNase III. Two different <lb/>pathways for biofilm formation are proposed: an RNase III-dependent <lb/>pathway in which other uncharacterized factor(s) inhibit RNase III activity, <lb/>thereby upregulating biofilm formation, and an RNase III-independent <lb/>pathway in which both YmdB and RpoS interdependently regulate the <lb/>inhibition of biofilm formation. In terms of gene expression, the level of <lb/>RpoS is post-transcriptionally regulated by YmdB either directly <lb/>or indirectly via the inhibition of RNase III activity [18,20], while the level <lb/>of YmdB is regulated transcriptionally by the RpoS protein [18]. <lb/></body>

			<body>ClsC, a recently identified cardiolipin synthase in E. coli <lb/>[45]. ClsC utilizes phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) as the <lb/>phosphatidyl donor to phosphatidylglycine (PG) to form <lb/>cardiolipin (CL) [46]. While YmdB is apparently not a <lb/>direct modulator of that pathway (since changes in clsC <lb/>(ymdC) gene expression in the microarrays were negligible <lb/>(a 1.1-fold increase only); (data not shown), it may modu-<lb/>late it indirectly via the action of the fatty acid biosynthesis <lb/>gene, fabD (Table 1), on the CL synthesis-regulating gene; <lb/>however, such a role has not been confirmed. <lb/>The ectopic expression of YmdB almost completely <lb/>regulates RNase III activity with respect to several targets, <lb/>including pnp, rnc and ribosomal RNA processing <lb/>(Additional file 1: Figure S2) [6]; however, biofilm forma-<lb/>tion is not solely dependent upon YmdB-directed RNase <lb/>III regulation, suggesting that gene expression data will be <lb/>useful for identifying unknown RNase III-independently <lb/>regulated YmdB functions. <lb/>Several trans-acting factors that modulate the RNase <lb/>activity of both exo-and endo-RNases have been identified <lb/>in E. coli [15-18,47,48]. Among these four trans-acting <lb/>regulatory proteins for endo-RNase activity have been well <lb/>characterized in E. coli: RraA [15] and RraB [16] for RNase <lb/>E, and bacteriophage T7 protein kinase [17] and YmdB [18] <lb/>for RNase III. The presence of homologs in other species <lb/>suggests such regulation of endo-RNase activity is generally <lb/>required for bacterial physiology. Recently, gene expression <lb/>profiling revealed a role for RraA in regulating the SOS <lb/>response, a mechanism which responds to the stress caused <lb/>by DNA damage [15,49]. RNase III modulates approxi-<lb/>mately 12% (592 genes) of the E. coli genome [35]; using <lb/>YmdB-mediated down-regulation of RNase III rather than <lb/>an RNase III mutant retains the ability to measure the <lb/>effect of trans-acting factor(s) and hence the correct physio-<lb/>logical modulation of RNase III. Because YmdB regulates <lb/>the turnover of approximately 30% of the target genes <lb/>of RNase III (Additional file 1: Table S3) and the rpoS <lb/>level is not completely regulated by YmdB (Figure 4), <lb/>either other regulator(s) that result RNase III mutant-<lb/>like conditions must be present or YmdB partially <lb/>regulates the physiology of the RNase III-mutant to <lb/>induce the up-regulation of an RNase III activator <lb/>that has yet to be identified. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>The data presented herein show that YmdB functions <lb/>both to regulate RNase III activity and to modulate <lb/>bacterial biofilm formation; therefore, YmdB seems to <lb/>be a multifunctional bacterial macrodomain protein, <lb/>similar to that in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, this <lb/>protein will make it possible to design a more intelligent <lb/>synthetic scaffold for producing bacterial cells that <lb/>modulate difficult-to-treat pathogens that depend upon <lb/>biofilm production. <lb/></body>
