			<body>Background &amp; Summary <lb/>To study large morphological brain changes associated with ageing and disease, magnetic resonance <lb/>imaging (MRI) data of the brain are acquired then analysed, often by segmenting tissue types (i.e. grey <lb/>matter, white mater, cerebro-spinal fluid) and parcellating the brain into regions which are defined by <lb/>gyri and sulci. Most gyral volumes that are publicly available have been derived either automatically or <lb/>semi-automatically. The latter group typically stems from automated parcellation (or segmentation), <lb/>followed by manual changes, correcting for errors often due to inaccuracies in the segmentation and/or <lb/>the parcellation scheme 1,2 . Because of the manual aspect, they are usually classified as &apos;manually-<lb/>generated&apos;. These datasets are considered as the &apos;gold standard&apos; and exist for the various brain regions-<lb/>cortical 2,3 , subcortical 4 , abnormal (such as tumours or lesions 5 ), and the whole brain (LPBA40 6 ; NeuAtlas <lb/>(Neuromorphometrics, Inc. NeuAtlas, http://www.neuromorphometrics.com/?p=315)-although they <lb/>are not always available to the public 4 . In theory however, manually-generated data should only refer to <lb/>volumes that are hand-drawn, from beginning to end, and are therefore free of software-related bias. <lb/>Because the manual process is very tedious and time-consuming, such datasets are very rare (e.g., MNI-<lb/>HISUB25 7 ). <lb/>Irrespective of the nature of segmentation, available datasets rarely provide population demographics, <lb/>details on how the regions have been drawn or obtained, or whether anatomical variations are <lb/>considered 1 . Scarce attempts have been made in retrospect to address these issues 2 . This situation proves <lb/>to be challenging for end-users following such tools&apos; parcellation protocols, particularly when it comes to <lb/>anatomical variability, leaving lots of room for assumptions, misinterpretations, and inconsistent <lb/>parcellations, all of which are undesirable. Previous work suggests that automated image analysis tools <lb/>reliant on these protocols go on to produce differing representations of the similarly named same gyrus, <lb/>rendering interpretation and/or comparisons impossible 1,8,9 . <lb/>For more clarity on these essential aspects, we created a new parcellation protocol 10 , based on two <lb/>anatomical atlases 11,12 . The protocol describes 3 particular gyri-the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the <lb/>supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and the cingulate gyrus (CG)-while providing methodical step-by-step <lb/>instructions for identifying each of their borders. Ultimately, all gyri should be defined in a manner that <lb/>allows for morphological variability to be accounted for, making automated parcellation tools more <lb/>reliable. Here we focused on these 3 gyri as they are known to exhibit structural changes in ageing 13 and <lb/>dementia 14-17 populations, and to significantly differ between sexes 13,18 . <lb/>We provide parcellation of 10 subjects&apos; left and right SFG, SMG, and CG, which should prove useful to <lb/>the brain imaging community given how rare manually-segmented datasets are. Although the sample size <lb/>is small, these data are a good example of the morphological changes that an upper middle-aged healthy <lb/>population undergoes, and a valuable ground truth for studies investigating the effects of ageing and/or <lb/>disease on cohorts of similar age. We include complete population demographics and a detailed protocol <lb/>that accounts for anatomical variability such as interruptions, connections and branching. This 60-gyrus <lb/>dataset could also be used as a reference (rather than absolute truth) to assess inter-package parcellation <lb/>differences or to validate a novel or improved parcellation tool, independently of the borders defined in <lb/>the protocol, because the manually parcellated data allow checking for the anatomical variability we <lb/>describe. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Dataset Methods <lb/>Subjects. Ten healthy right-handed non-smoking subjects (5 male, 5 female, age range 55-64 years <lb/>old), not on any medication, were randomly selected among a larger NIH-funded study (NIH grant R01 <lb/>EB004155) involving 80 healthy subjects. MRI data were collected at the Western General Hospital <lb/>(Edinburgh, UK) and structural scans were examined by a fully-qualified radiologist, confirming all <lb/>subjects were in good health. <lb/>Data acquisition. The scans and cognitive tests were acquired and administered in 2008-2012, (data <lb/>summarized in Table 1) prior to the development of community reporting standards, however, all data <lb/>were systematically collected and reported. The local ethics committee approved the study and informed <lb/>consent was obtained from each patient. For each of the 10 subjects in this dataset, 4 MRI volumes were <lb/>obtained: coronal high resolution 3D T1-weighted (T1w), axial T2-weighted (T2w), T2*-weighted and T2 <lb/>FLAIR. All scans were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) at the <lb/>Brain Research Imaging Centre in Edinburgh (UK). Further details can be found in Tables 2 and 3 of the <lb/>Data Records section). <lb/>A medical questionnaire and a battery of cognitive subtests from the 4 th edition of the Wechsler Adult <lb/>Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV 19 ) were administered to each healthy volunteer. Checks were made to ensure <lb/>that they scored within the normal range (Table 1). <lb/>The general practitioner (GP) of every volunteer was contacted twice throughout the study: once to <lb/>inform them of the subject&apos;s participation in the study&apos;s details (along with the study&apos;s information sheet), <lb/>and once more to inform them of the scan&apos;s outcome. <lb/> Data preparation. Given the limited contrast between grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and <lb/>cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 1.5 T, we adopted a multispectral method to enhance the raw subject volumes <lb/></body>

The number of folds in a gyrus may increase or decrease, and sulci may experience a <lb/>combination of branching, connections, interruptions, and absences 11 . Given that sulci are the landmarks <lb/>most commonly used for defining gyral borders, their misrepresentation can significantly skew gyral <lb/>representations, producing false over-or under-estimations of them. It therefore becomes crucial to <lb/>define parcellation protocols in a manner that is clear and flexible enough to incorporate and reflect all <lb/>recognised variability, but with consistent reproducibility. Existing protocols fail to do so as they either <lb/>omit some forms of variability reported in the literature or fail to clarify how a particular form (e.g., sulcal <lb/>absence, sulcal discontinuity, double sulcal occurrence, etc.) shall be addressed 1 . <lb/>Protocol details.

			<body>internally. To define these two borders, or surfaces, we instruct the user to create two separate paired <lb/>masks (or borders), one for the GM&apos;s outer border and one for its inner border. <lb/>We consulted 2 brain atlases to devise a comprehensive protocol for the SFG, SMG and CG. The first <lb/>atlas, by Duvernoy 12 , indicates the general location of each gyrus, in various views and throughout the <lb/>brain, however, sulcal variability details such as interruptions, connections, and branching are missing. <lb/>The second, by Ono et al. 11 , thoroughly describes sulcal patterns and variability, but rarely in relation to <lb/>adjacent gyri. Despite their variability, sulci are the main gyral delimiters, necessitating a clear <lb/>understanding of them and of the consequent gyral variations. By combining the valuable details from <lb/>both anatomical sources (gyral location from the first and the patterns and variability of their delimiters <lb/>from the second), we moulded a single, accurate, consistent and detailed protocol for the three gyri. For <lb/>each gyrus we first specify the view (axial, sagittal, or coronal) in which it is to be identified and drawn, <lb/>while naming all gyral borders, mainly sulci. We then provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on <lb/>drawing the gyrus from start to end, along the direction in which it propagates, in addition to <lb/>information on the known variations that may be encountered and how to address them. We occasionally <lb/>resort to a notch or artificial line rather than a sulcus to mark a clear start or end to the segmentation, for <lb/>the sake of consistency and reproducibility. Illustrations accompany the instructions for clarification <lb/>purposes. <lb/>Because of the gyral folding pattern (frequency and sharpness of turns), software can fail to accurately <lb/>outline the anatomy (e.g., sulcus, gyrus, or surface). Furthermore, with cortical thickness ranging from <lb/>1 mm to ~5 mm 24,25 , it becomes more difficult to identify the grey and white matter boundaries due to <lb/>partial volume effects. We therefore used multiple segments to represent these boundaries, while <lb/>accurately following each rise and fall in the cortical surface. <lb/>Parcellation details. For each of the 10 subjects, we first loaded the enhanced difference volume (T1w-<lb/>T2w) in MRIcron (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron, version 22DEC2015), of voxel size 1 × 1 × <lb/>2 mm. Then we manually traced the paired masks representing outer and inner GM borders for the SFG, <lb/>SMG and CG in both the right and left hemispheres following the pre-defined protocol 10 . Importantly, <lb/>this was done for every discontinuity and every sharp change in curvature. As a result, many segments <lb/>were required to outline a single gyrus. The segments were merged to form a single volume for each <lb/>gyrus. A workflow detailing how the derived data were made is illustrated in Fig. 2. The workflow in <lb/>Fig. 2 illustrates how the derived data were made. We identified a total of 66 sulcal (CS and SFS) <lb/>discontinuities in the axial plane at the SFG, 24 gyral discontinuities in the sagittal plane at the SMG, and <lb/>Figure 2. Workflow depicting the stages followed to create the derivative masks. From the source T1w and <lb/>T2w data, difference volumes were generated and gyral borders were outlined using multiple segments. The <lb/>segments were then combined into a single 4D and a single 3D file for each gyrus (top). For comparison <lb/>purpose, a multispectral segmentation of grey and white matter tissue was also performed using SPM12 <lb/>(bottom). <lb/></body>

			<body>103 sulcal (CS) discontinuities in the sagittal plane at the CG, all of which are a result of the folding <lb/>nature of cortical gyri (Table 4). We also identified 6 double sulcal (CS), and therefore 6 double gyral <lb/>(CG) occurrences (n = 6). These anatomical variations (sulcal discontinuities and double sulcal <lb/>occurrences) will have influenced our gyral parcellations. <lb/>A standard approach for validating a parcellation protocol is to obtain equivalent manual <lb/>segmentations from several experts. We instead sought to validate the consistency of our manual <lb/>parcellation, i.e., the anatomical landmarks defining the gyral borders which are known to vary across <lb/>hemispheres and subjects. This alternative method is very similar to that of Klein and Tourville 2 where <lb/>the authors first automatically parcellated the brains using their older protocol 26 , then followed it with <lb/>manual corrections based on the anatomical variability they detected in each of the subjects which the <lb/>automated method failed to identify. Here, after reviewing the 2 anatomical brain atlases 11,12 and writing <lb/>the protocol, the first author (SM) manually segmented and parcellated all 10 subjects&apos; regions of interest. <lb/>They were then revised for landmark consistency and accuracy by 2 experts, CP and GM, who were <lb/>blinded from the protocol. When inconsistency was found across subjects, the protocol was amended, <lb/>and the regions were redrawn and reviewed again.

			<body>Columns 2-10 contain FreeSurfer-derived metrics, columns 11-19 contain Masks2Metrics-derived metrics, <lb/>and columns 20-22 contain mean modified Hausdorff distance (MMHD, https://uk.mathworks.com/ <lb/>matlabcentral/fileexchange/29968-modified-hausdorff-distance) metrics. Further metrics details can be found <lb/>in the Technical Validation section. <lb/>Technical Validation <lb/>As mentioned in the &apos;Parcellation Details&apos; section, we validated the protocol using a blinded review of the <lb/>data checking between subjects consistency whilst still considering of all known forms of cortical <lb/>variability. A scanner strength of 1.5 T was sufficient as we did not seek to validate the grey matter-<lb/>cerebrospinal fluid and grey matter-white matter border segmentation itself, but the consistency in <lb/>parcellation and border identification despite all sorts of cortical variability, across hemispheres and <lb/>subjects. <lb/>To quantitatively assess the data parcels, we compared the average thickness, volume and surface area <lb/>of each gyrus/sulcus from our parcellation to that of FreeSurfer (version freesurfer-Linux-<lb/>centos4_x86_64-stable-pub-v5.1.0). Although anatomical variations are not accounted for as much as <lb/>in our protocol 1 , it still provides a valuable comparison, as variations should not be substantial, in <lb/>particular for average thickness 30 . We also computed MMHD which, like FreeSurfer, is computed by <lb/>averaging the shortest distance from each voxel on one segment to the other segment, in both directions. <lb/>M2M on the other hand measures the perpendicular from one segment to the other, in both directions. <lb/>We computed this distance for the inner and outer GM masks and compared it to those of the other two <lb/>methods (Table <lb/>We ran FreeSurfer using default settings to process each subject&apos;s T1w NifTI volume, then limited our <lb/>investigations to the output of the Desikan-Killiany protocol 26 -specifically SFG, CG and SMG <lb/>parcellations -and corresponding measurements. FreeSurfer developers recommend that manual checks <lb/>and corrections typically follow automated parcellation, however, they were omitted in our case for two <lb/>main reasons: (1) so as not to introduce human error/bias, and (2) the corrections would not have a <lb/>drastic effect on ROI average thickness, while equalizing volume and surface area because of our edits <lb/>(detailed under &apos;Data Preparation&apos;). For the SFG and SMG, metrics for the corresponding FreeSurfer <lb/>labels were used, &apos;superiorfrontal&apos; (label 80) and &apos;supramarginal&apos; (label 83) respectively, while for the CG, <lb/>Figure 5. A demonstration of protocol differences stemming from cortical variability, as seen in several <lb/>subjects. With our protocol, the double cingulate sulcus scenario for subject 5&apos;s left hemisphere, shown in the <lb/>T1w-T2w difference volume, contributes to a CG with two folds (a), whereas with FreeSurfer&apos;s protocol, the <lb/>superior fold is mostly (inside the yellow box) a part of the SFG (b). Parts of the upper CG fold are similarly <lb/>omitted by FreeSurfer in the left hemispheres of subjects 1 (c) and 6 (d). <lb/></body>

			<body>4 FreeSurfer labels (&apos;rostralanteriorcingulate&apos;, &apos;caudalanteriorcingulate&apos;, &apos;posteriorcingulate&apos; and &apos;isth-<lb/>muscingulate&apos;, or labels 78,55,75,62) were used to ensure &apos;like-for-like&apos; comparison. <lb/>Generally, gyrus thicknesses, as derived by the 3 methods, are in agreement with lateral (3.5 mm), <lb/>medial (2.7 mm) and overall (2.5 mm) cortical thicknesses measured in post-mortem brains 25 (Fig. 3). A <lb/>percentile bootstrap on median differences showed no difference for the SFG between M2M and <lb/>FreeSurfer (median difference 0.02 [−0.08 0.13] p = 0.68), and lower M2M estimates for the SMG <lb/>(median difference 0.18 [0.09 0.3] p = 0.001) and CG (0.51 [0.36 0.59] p = 0.001). These last two <lb/>differences are mainly due to the large variability in the ROIs&apos; bordering landmarks. Furthermore, the CG <lb/>consisted of a large number of short segments implying that fewer perpendicular M2M thickness <lb/>measurements were nonzero compared to the corresponding shorter-distance measurements of <lb/>FreeSurfer. Because both the MMHD and FreeSurfer seek the shortest distance, their results should be <lb/>comparable. FreeSurfer measurements are however made in 3D while our approaches rely on 2D leading <lb/>to an overestimation (SFG median difference 0.18 [0.06 0.27] p = 0.006; SMG median difference 0.31 <lb/>[0.13 0.45] p = 0.001; CG median difference 0.28 [0.12 0.52] p = 0.002). Together these results indicate <lb/>that accounting for variability by creating segments is essential so as to not over-estimate thickness. <lb/>Since our data accounts for anatomical variations such as a double CG, which we encountered in 6 of <lb/>the 10 subjects&apos; hemispheres, significantly larger mean CG GM volume (Fig. 4c) and in turn mean WM <lb/>surface area (Fig. 4f) measurements are observed in the manually-derived parcels compared to their <lb/>corresponding FreeSurfer counterparts (median volume difference 6304.2 [3627.08 8806.70] p = 0.002; <lb/>median surface area difference 2193.34 [1276.27 3179.56] p = 0.002). In the event of a double CG, the <lb/>SFG on the medial surface &apos;loses&apos; its inferior-most fold to the CG in our protocol (Fig. 5a), compared to <lb/>FreeSurfer (Fig. 5b-d). This explains why our manually-derived SFG WM surface areas are smaller than <lb/>their corresponding FreeSurfer-derived ones ((Fig. 4d-median difference 1379.99 [529.01 2468.41] p = <lb/>0.002), and to a lesser extent also GM volumes, although not significantly (Fig. 4a -median volume <lb/>difference 632.61 [−3105.74 3680.1] p = 0.63). The double cingulate occurrences in our cohort also <lb/>explain the wider distributions for both the CG (Fig. 4c,f) and SFG (Fig. 4a,d). <lb/>The greatest disagreement between the two methods was evident when calculating SMG metrics. This <lb/>is most likely due to the inferior border of the SMG in our protocol being more superior than that of <lb/>Figure 6. Regression analysis on CG metrics. CG thickness (a), volume (b), and surface area (c) as measured <lb/>by M2M and FreeSurfer with respect to NART scores. <lb/></body>

			<body>FreeSurfer, lending to smaller manually-segmented parcels, and therefore smaller parcel volumes <lb/>(Fig. 4b) and inner mask surface areas (Fig. 4e) with M2M than with FreeSurfer (median volume <lb/>difference 6588.74 [4165.12 7873.76] p = 0.002; median surface area difference 2598.92 [2012.17 <lb/>2954.39] p = 0.002). <lb/>Not only do parcellation schemes (and tools) have direct implications on the morphometrics of the <lb/>regions they outline, but also on any concomitant analyses. To demonstrate this, we conducted a <lb/>regression analysis on the three CG metrics (thickness, volume and surface area), as measured by M2M <lb/>and FreeSurfer, with respect to the National Adult Reading Test (NART) score. The NART is a WAIS-IV <lb/>subtest (reported as NART50 in Table 1 and available with the MRI data). <lb/>The highest density interval (HDI) of the difference in regression coefficients did not differ between <lb/>our parcellation and FreeSurfer&apos;s for CG thickness (HDI: [−0.001 0.0006], Fig. 6a), but was statistically <lb/>different for both CG volume (HDI: [−0.0016 −0.0021], Fig. 6b) and surface area (HDI: [−0.0025 <lb/>−0.0002], Fig. 6c), with no association using either parcellation scheme. <lb/>It is understandable that when dealing with large datasets it is not possible to manually segment the <lb/>entire ground truth. However, from what we have observed with our small cohort, cortical variability is <lb/>not rare. It is therefore crucial to be aware of the variability details of any regions of interest, and when <lb/>working with automated tools to check for variability considerations to best assess the implications this <lb/>may have on the results, if any. The data presented here provide in that sense a good testing ground for <lb/>automated MRI parcellation. <lb/></body>
