While synaptic GABA A -Rs can exert rapid inhibition, the extrasynaptic <lb/>GABA A -Rs can tonically inhibit neuronal activity due to constant activation by ambient GABA. <lb/>The δ subunit-containing GABA A -Rs are expressed abundantly in the cerebellum, hippocam-<lb/>pus and thalamus to mediate the major tonic inhibition in the brain. While electrophysiological <lb/>and pharmacological properties of the δ-GABA A -Rs have been well characterized, the molec-<lb/>ular interacting partners of the δ-GABA A -Rs are not clearly defined. Here, using a yeast two-<lb/>hybrid screening assay, we identified transthyretin (TTR) as a novel regulatory molecule for <lb/>the δ-GABA A -Rs. Knockdown of TTR in cultured cerebellar granule neurons significantly <lb/>decreased the δ receptor expression; whereas overexpressing TTR in cortical neurons <lb/>increased the δ receptor expression. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed that knockdown <lb/>or overexpression of TTR in cultured neurons resulted in a corresponding decrease or <lb/>increase of tonic currents. Furthermore, in vivo analysis of TTR-/-mice revealed a significant <lb/>decrease of the surface expression of the δ-GABA A -Rs in cerebellar granule neurons. <lb/>Together, our studies identified TTR as a novel regulator of the δ-GABA A -Rs. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) activates GABA A and GABA B receptors to mediate the majority <lb/>of inhibition in the brain [1, 2]. GABA A receptors (GABA A -Rs) are located on both synaptic <lb/>and extrasynaptic membranes to mediate phasic and tonic inhibition. We have recently dem-<lb/>onstrated that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A -Rs compete with each other to regulate the <lb/>homeostasis of inhibition [3]. Deficits in GABA A -R-mediated neurotransmission are involved <lb/>in epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and autism [4-8]. Extrasynaptic GABA A -Rs <lb/>are sensitive to steroid and alcohol regulation, and play important roles in sleep, stress, <lb/>puberty, learning, and pregnancy-related mood disorders [9-11]. The δ subunit-containing <lb/>GABA A -Rs (δ-GABA A -Rs) are one of the major subtypes of extrasynaptic GABA A -Rs, localiz-<lb/>ing in the cerebellum (α6βδ), hippocampus and thalamus (α4βδ) [9, 12-14]. Although it is <lb/></body>

			<body>well known that δ-GABA A -Rs mediate tonic inhibition of neuronal activity in the brain [9, 14, <lb/>15], the molecular partners that interact with the δ-GABA A -Rs have not yet been identified. <lb/>Here, we employed a yeast two-hybridization system to screen for δ-subunit interacting <lb/>proteins from a mouse cerebellar cDNA library, a brain region in which the δ-subunit is highly <lb/>expressed. We indentified transthyretin (TTR) as a novel interacting partner for the δ-subunit. <lb/>Transthyretin (TTR) is a transporter for thyroxine and retinol-binding protein bound to reti-<lb/>nol in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid [16, 17]. Plasma TTR is mainly produced by liver, <lb/>while TTR in the brain is predominantly synthesized by choroid plexus [18] and by neurons <lb/>under stress [19]. TTR interacts with the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) oligomers and fibrils and <lb/>may play a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer&apos;s disease [20-23]. <lb/>Our current study demonstrates that TTR interacts with δ-GABA A -Rs and regulates their <lb/>expression and function. We found that TTR co-immunoprecipitates with the δ subunit in <lb/>brain lysates. Knockdown of TTR expression in cultured cerebellar granule cells significantly <lb/>reduced the surface δ expression level as well as the corresponding tonic current. Conversely, <lb/>overexpressing TTR in cortical neurons, which typically have low levels of δ expression, signifi-<lb/>cantly increased the surface expression level of the δ subunit and the tonic current as well. <lb/>Interestingly, external application of recombinant human TTR (hTTR), but not mutant mono-<lb/>meric hTTR, significantly increased the surface δ receptors in cultured cerebellar granule cells. <lb/>We further investigated TTR regulation of the δ receptors in TTR knockout mice, and <lb/>observed a significant decrease of the δ surface staining in cerebellar granule layer compared <lb/>to the wild type (WT) mice. In conclusion, we discovered that TTR is a novel interacting part-<lb/>ner for the δ-GABA A -Rs. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Yeast two-hybrid assay <lb/>Mouse cerebellar RNA was extracted using Neuron spin RNA II kit (Clontech). Make Your <lb/>Own &quot;Mate &amp; Plate™&quot; Library (Clontech) was used to establish the mouse cDNA library from <lb/>the cerebellar RNA according to the manual. Matchmaker™ Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System <lb/>(Clontech) and the established cDNA library were used in the interacting screen according to <lb/>the manual. The interaction of pray (pGADT7) and bait (pGBKT7) fusion proteins were <lb/>assayed by the AUR1-C, ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1 reporters. Plasmid DNA of positive clones <lb/>was recovered and inserts were analyzed by sequencing. <lb/>Plasmid constructs and transfection <lb/>The extracellular domain of the δ subunit of GABA A receptor was subcloned into pGBKT7-DNA <lb/>BD vector (Clontech). The full-length TTR cDNA was amplified from mouse cerebellar RNA <lb/>and was cloned as BGII and EcoR fragment into pN3HA plasmid in which the GFP sequence of <lb/>pEGFPC1 was replaced by triple HA (a kind gift from Dr. Yingwei Mao) or PEGFPC1 vector. <lb/>The plasmid pLenti-GIII-CMV encoding the full length human TTR with RFP reporter driven <lb/>by the independent promoter was purchased from Applied Biological Materials (Richmond, <lb/>Canada). The GIPZ mouse TTR shRNA vector was purchased from Open Biosystem. The vec-<lb/>tors of GABA A receptor δ, α6, β3 subunits were described preciously in our publications [3, 24]. <lb/>The purified proteins of human TTR and mutated monomeric hTTR are from Dr. Buxbaum&apos; <lb/>Lab (Scripps Research Institute). Primary cultured neurons were transfected using calcium-phos-<lb/>hphate transfection protocol as described [25]. For HEK 293T cell transfection, polyethylenimine <lb/>(PEI, Polyscience) was used. <lb/></body>

			<body>Mice and primary neuron culture <lb/>C57BL/6 [WT (B6)] and mttr-/-(mouse ttr knockout) mice were used similar to that described <lb/>before [19]. C57BL/6 were purchased from Jackson Lab. Mice of mttr-/-were from Dr. Bux-<lb/>baum&apos; Lab(Scripps Institutes). Mice of either sex were used in the experiments. Primary cere-<lb/>bellar and cortical tissues were dissected out from C57BL/6 mouse pups (newborn for cortical <lb/>culture and postnatal 5-7 days for cerebellar culture) as described previously [3, 26, 27]. All <lb/>the animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use <lb/>Committee at Penn State University (IACUC# 43379). Briefly, cerebellar or cortical cells were <lb/>dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA containing 50 units/ml DNase I and then plated on a <lb/>monolayer of cortical astrocytes at a density of 8,000-12,000 cells/cm 2 . The cerebellar neuron <lb/>culture medium contained 500 ml MEM (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR), 10% fetal bovine serum <lb/>(HyClone, Logan, UT), 10 ml B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 100 mg NaHCO3, 20 mM KCl, <lb/>0.5 mM L-glutamine, 25 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 4 μM AraC to suppress the <lb/>excessive proliferation of astrocytes. Neurons were maintained at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 -humidi-<lb/>fied incubator for 2-3 weeks. All data presented as mean ± SE. Student&apos;s t test or one-way <lb/>ANOVA followed with Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analyses. <lb/>Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot <lb/>The cerebellum tissue of adult mice was dissected out and homogenized in cold IP lysis buffer <lb/>containing 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol <lb/>(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors <lb/>(Sigma), followed by incubation at 4˚C for 30 min and sonication twice for 30 s each. The <lb/>supernatant of brain extracts was harvested by centrifugation (12,000 g, 10 min). Protein con-<lb/>tent was measured by Bradford protein assay (Thermo Scientific). For Co-IP assay, the cerebel-<lb/>lum extracts or the overexpressed HEK cell lysates were first pre-cleaned by incubation with <lb/>Dynabeads M-280 IgG (Invitrogen) for 2 hr at 4˚C. 2 μg primary antibodies of rabbit anti-<lb/>TTR (DAKO), mouse anti-HA (Santacruz), or rabbit anti-myc (cell signal Tech) were added <lb/>into the protein lysate and incubated overnight at 4˚C, followed by adding 30 μl Dynabead M-<lb/>280 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and incubating for another 4 hr at 4˚C. After <lb/>washing with PBS, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and boiled for 10 min in <lb/>NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). The precipitated protein was then separated by <lb/>SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. The primary antibodies used in this <lb/>study included mouse anti-HA, rabbit anti-Myc, rabbit anti-GABA A -R δ subunit (PhosphoSo-<lb/>lution, Aurora, USA), and mouse anti-actin (BD). Immunoblot band intensities were quanti-<lb/>fied using Image J software. All experiments were repeated at least three times independently. <lb/>Immunocytochemistry <lb/>For live cell staining, cultured cerebellar or cotical neurons (9-12 days in vitro) were incubated <lb/>in bath solution (128 mM NaCl, 30 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 and <lb/>1 mM MgCl 2 (320 mOsm, pH 7.4) with primary anti-GABA A -R δ subunit or anti-transthyre-<lb/>tin antibodies (Abcam) at 4˚C for 1 hr, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline <lb/>(PBS) and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After fixation, neurons were <lb/>blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, followed by incubation with Dylight-conjugated anti-<lb/>rabbit 546 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or Alexa flour 488 (1:500, Molecular probes) for <lb/>2 hr under non-permeabilized condition. <lb/>For total protein staining, neurons were washed with bath solution, fixed by 4% PFA for 12 <lb/>min, and followed by three times washing with PBS. Then, neurons were permeabilized with <lb/>0.2% triton in PBS for 8 min, and changed into 5% NDS + 0.1% triton in PBS for 30 min before <lb/></body>

After extensive wash-<lb/>ing with PBS, the coverslips with neurons were incubated with appropriate secondary antibod-<lb/>ies for 1 hr at room temperature, and then rinsed with PBS four times. The coverslips were <lb/>finally mounted with anti-fading mounting solution containing DAPI (Invitrogen). The <lb/>images were taken by an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon TE 2000-S) or a confocal micro-<lb/>scope (Olympus FV1000) and analyzed by Image J software. <lb/>For mouse brain section staining, 7-8 months old mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Aver-<lb/>tin and then perfused with cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for 2 min. The whole brain was <lb/>immediately taken out and cut into half and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4˚C. The brain tissue <lb/>was then cut into 45 μm slices with a vibratome (Lecia). The brain slices were washed with PBS <lb/>and pretreated with 0.3% triton for 2 hr and then incubated with 5% NDS and 0.1% triton in <lb/>PBS for 2 hr. The primary antibodies in blocking solution were applied to brain slices at 4˚C <lb/>overnight. The next day, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with proper fluoro-<lb/>phore-conjucated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. After the secondary <lb/>antibody incubation, the excessive antibodies were washed off with PBS and the coverslips or <lb/>brain slices were mounted in anti-fading mounting solution with DAPI (Invitrogen). The <lb/>images were collected on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. For quantification of <lb/>GABA A -R δ subunit signal, the mean intensity of neuronal soma was analyzed by Image J soft-<lb/>ware. The colocalization was analyzed with the Intensity Correlation analysis plug-in in ImageJ <lb/>(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) [28]. All experiments were repeated at least <lb/>three times independently. <lb/>Electrophysiology <lb/>TTR and TTR shRNA plasmids were transfected at 4 days in vitro (DIV) with Ca 2+ -phosphate <lb/>methods described before [25].

Fire-pol-<lb/>ished borosilicate glass pipettes with resistance of 3-5 MO were used for recording. The inter-<lb/>nal pipette solution contained (in mM) 135 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA, 10 Tris-<lb/>phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, and 0.5 Na 2 GTP (pH 7.3, ~300 Osm). Whole-cell recordings of <lb/>THIP-induced currents were performed at room temperature in voltage-clamp mode using <lb/>Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA), similar to previously <lb/>described [24]. The membrane potential was held at -70 mV. Data were acquired using <lb/>pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices), sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz. Cerebellar <lb/>cultures were recorded around DIV 8, whereas cortical cultures were recorded around DIV <lb/>14. To examine THIP-induced currents, neurons were perfused with bath solution that con-<lb/>tains TTX (0.5 μM) and CNQX (10 μΜ) to block voltage-gated sodium channels and AMPA/ <lb/>kainate receptor currents. THIP (2 μM) was then applied for 10 s through a valve-controlled <lb/>drug delivery system VC-6 (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) to elicit stable inward current. <lb/>All experiments were repeated at least three times independently. <lb/>Results <lb/>Transthyretin identified as the interacting partner for GABA A receptor δ <lb/>subunit <lb/>The structure of GABA A -R δ subunit includes one extracellular domain (extra-δ), one cyto-<lb/>plasmic domain and four transmembrane domains.

			<body>extensively studied in terms of function and subcellular localization, the molecular partners <lb/>interacting with δ-GABA A -Rs have not yet been identified. To understand the molecular <lb/>mechanism of δ-receptor regulation, we used the extracellular domain of the δ subunit (amino <lb/>acid 17-248) as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting proteins. Since the <lb/>cerebellum has a high level of δ subunit expression, we made the cDNA library from adult <lb/>mouse cerebellum. From this library, one of the positive clones encoding amino acid 73-147 <lb/>of transthyretin (TTR) was isolated (Fig 1A). To confirm the interaction between TTR and the <lb/>extra-δ in mammalian systems, HA-tagged full length TTR and Myc-tagged extra-δ were co-<lb/>expressed in HEK cells, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with HA or myc antibodies. <lb/>Both HA-TTR and myc-extra-δ were co-precipitated with each other (Fig 1B and 1C). Consis-<lb/>tently, confocal images showed that TTR was co-localized with α6β3δ receptors when co-<lb/>expressed in HEK cells (Fig 1D). The co-localozation of the transfected TTR and α6β3δ recep-<lb/>tors was analyzed using intensity correlation analysis. The mean intensity correlation quotient <lb/>(ICQ) number of the co-localozation of the transfected TTR and delta subunits is 0.333±0.108 <lb/>(Fig 1E), which means that the staining of TTR and α6β3δ receptors are dependent staining. <lb/>Therefore, our results identified TTR as a novel interacting protein with the δ subunit of <lb/>GABA A receptors. <lb/>Endogenous transthyretin interacts with δ-GABA A receptors in the <lb/>cerebellum <lb/>It is well know that δ-subunit-containing GABAA receptors mediate tonic inhibition in cere-<lb/>bellar granule cells [29], the dentate gyrus granule cells [29], alamic neurons [30], and in pyra-<lb/>midal neurons[31]. And recently, α1δ-subunit assemblies were shown to be present in the <lb/>hippocampal interneurons [32]. These inspire us to examine the interaction between TTR and <lb/>the δ subunit of GABA A -Rs in primary neuronal cultures. We started with an investigation of <lb/>the endogenous signal of TTR and the δ subunit in cerebellar granule cells in primary cultures. <lb/>After fixation and membrane permeabilization, we found that TTR and the δ subunit partially <lb/>co-localized in granule cells (Fig 2A). We further performed live cell staining without mem-<lb/>brane permeabilization and demonstrated that TTR and the δ subunit also partially co-local-<lb/>ized on cell surface (Fig 2B). We next overexpressed human TTR (hTTR) and the rat δ subunit <lb/>in cultured cortical neurons, which usually lack endogenous δ subunit, and performed live cell <lb/>staining. Again, the expressed hTTR and the δ subunit were found partially co-localized in cor-<lb/>tical neurons (Fig 2C). The quantification of both total staining and surface staining of TTR <lb/>and δ-GABA A -Rs in cerebellar neurons was analyzed by the intensity correlation analysis. The <lb/>mean intensity correlation quotient (ICQ) of total staining is 0.242±0.043, and the mean ICQ <lb/>of surface staining is 0.318±0.048 (Fig 2E). The number of ICQ between 0 and +0.5 indicates <lb/>that they are dependent staining. To further understand whether TTR interacts with the δ-<lb/>GABA A -Rs in mouse brain in vivo, we used TTR antibodies to immunoprecipitate TTR from <lb/>cerebellum lysate, which is known to contain a high level of the δ-GABA A -Rs [33]. Immuno-<lb/>blotting with the δ-specific antibodies clearly showed that TTR and the δ-GABA A -Rs were co-<lb/>immunoprecipitated with each other in the cerebellum tissue (Fig 2D). Therefore, TTR can <lb/>interact with the δ-GABA A -Rs in the brain in vivo. <lb/>TTR regulates the expression of δ-GABA A receptors <lb/>To investigate whether TTR directly regulates the δ-GABA A -R expression in neuronal cells, we <lb/>knocked down TTR expression with mouse-specific shRNAs in cultured cerebellar granule <lb/>cells.

			<body>To further understand the functional regulation of TTR on the extrasynaptic δ-GABA A -Rs, <lb/>we employed electrophysiological recordings to measure δ-GABA A -R mediated tonic currents <lb/>in cerebellar granule cell cultures. Low concentration of THIP is a relatively specific agonist <lb/>for δ-GABA A -Rs [13]. We found that application of THIP (2 μM) induced a significant tonic <lb/>current in cerebellar granule cells (Fig 3F), indicating the presence of δ-GABA A -Rs as revealed <lb/>by surface immunostaining. Importantly, the tonic current was significantly reduced after <lb/>knocking down TTR in cerebellar granule neurons, consistent with the reduction of surface δ-<lb/>staining induced by TTR shRNA (Fig 3G). Quantification indicated that both the THIP cur-<lb/>rent amplitude and the current density were significantly reduced in TTR knockdown cells <lb/>(Fig 3H and 3I; p &lt; 0.05), whereas the capacitance of cells, a measure of cell size was not <lb/>changed (Fig 3J). <lb/>We next examined whether increasing intracellular synthesis of TTR will affect the expres-<lb/>sion of the δ-GABA A -Rs. For this purpose, we tested in cultured cortical neurons, which nor-<lb/>mally do not express δ-GABA A -Rs. As shown in the control cortical neurons expressing <lb/>mCherry alone, the immunostaining of the δ subunit was essentially absent (Fig 4A, top row). <lb/>In contrast, when cortical neurons were transfected with human TTR, the δ immunostaining <lb/>signal was readily detected (Fig 4A, bottom row). Quantitative data showed a remarkable <lb/>increase of the δ expression level after overexpressing hTTR in cortical neurons (Fig 4B; <lb/>p &lt; 0.05). These immunostaining results were further confirmed with electrophysiological <lb/>analyses. To assess the level of the δ-GABA A -Rs in cortical neurons, we applied their specific <lb/>agonist THIP (2 μM) to examine the activated tonic current. We found that THIP-induced <lb/>tonic current was significantly increased in cortical neurons after overexpressing hTTR (Fig <lb/>4C-4G; p &lt; 0.05). Together, our results demonstrated that TTR is a potent regulator of the δ-<lb/>GABA A -Rs. <lb/>Monomeric TTR not effective in regulating δ-GABA A -Rs <lb/>TTR is mostly synthesized in the liver and in choroid plexus in the brain[18]. Therefore, neu-<lb/>rons are often exposed to TTR in the extracellular space. TTR normally circulates as a non-<lb/>covalently bound homo-tetramer [34]. A mutant TTR has been engineered that cannot form <lb/>tetramers and exists as a monomer [35]. To investigate which type of TTR, tetramer or mono-<lb/>mer, regulates the δ-GABA A -Rs, we added either normal purified human TTR (hTTR) protein <lb/>or purified monomeric hTTR (M-hTTR; both at 14 ug/ml) protein into the culture medium <lb/>for 24 hrs before analyzing the surface level of δ-GABA A -Rs in cerebellar granule neurons. <lb/>Both types of hTTR contain no tags. We found that normal hTTR protein significantly <lb/>increased the expression level of δ-GABA A -Rs as expected, but monomeric hTTR had no effect <lb/>on the δ-GABA A -Rs (Fig 5A). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that normal hTTR, but not <lb/>monomeric hTTR, increased the surface expression of δ-GABA A -Rs in both soma and den-<lb/>drites (Fig 5B; p &lt; 0.01). <lb/>In vivo analysis of TTR effect on δ-GABA A receptors <lb/>After in vitro analysis of TTR regulation of δ-GABA A -Rs in cell cultures, we further investi-<lb/>gated TTR effect in mouse brain in vivo by using TTR knockout mice (TTR-/-) [36].

			<body>reduced in TTR-/-neurons (Fig 6F and 6G; p &lt; 0.001). Thus, our in vivo analysis further dem-<lb/>onstrated that TTR plays an important role in regulating the δ-GABA A -Rs. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The current study identified TTR as a novel interacting partner for the extrasynaptic δ sub-<lb/>unit-containing GABA A -Rs. This was achieved by yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse cere-<lb/>bellum cDNA library where the δ transcript is enriched. We demonstrated that TTR and the <lb/>δ-GABA A -Rs can co-immunoprecipitate when coexpressed in HEK cells or directly lysed from <lb/>mouse cerebellar tissue. Overexpression and knockdown experiments in cultured neurons <lb/>suggest that TTR can potently regulate the expression level of the δ-GABA A -Rs. External appli-<lb/>cation of normal TTR, which typically forms tetramers, or mutant monomeric TTR revealed <lb/>that tetrameric TTR can regulate surface expression of δ-GABA A -Rs. In TTR-/-mice, we also <lb/>observed a reduction of the δ-GABA A -R expression level in the cerebellar granule layer. Func-<lb/>tionally, TTR regulates the tonic currents mediated by the δ-GABA A -Rs. Together our studies <lb/>suggest that TTR is a critical regulator of the δ-GABA A -Rs. <lb/>Identification of TTR as an interacting partner for the GABA A -R δ subunit <lb/>Using an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screening assay, we identified TTR as an interacting pro-<lb/>tein for the extracellular domain of the δ subunit of GABA A -Rs. We confirmed their interac-<lb/>tion in HEK 293T cells through co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments. Co-<lb/>immunoprecipitation experiments from brain tissue lysates further demonstrated that TTR <lb/>and the δ-GABA A -Rs interact with each other in vivo. In the brain, TTR is mainly secreted by <lb/>choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid [29]. Interestingly, cerebellum is in close proximity <lb/>of one of the choroid plexuses in the brain, and thus may be under the influence of TTR <lb/>secreted by the nearby choroid plexus. A recent study reported that sleep increases the <lb/>exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid in the brain [37]. Previous studies have <lb/>already found that the δ-GABA A -Rs may play a role in sleep [38, 39]. Thus, our studies raised a <lb/>possibility that TTR might be related to sleep by influencing the δ-GABA A -Rs. <lb/>Regulation of δ-GABA A -Rs by TTR <lb/>Our intracellular manipulation of TTR expression in cultured neurons suggests that TTR is a <lb/>potent regulator of δ-GABA A -Rs. We demonstrated that overexpression of TTR in cortical <lb/>neurons, which typically have low expression of δ-GABA A -Rs, significantly increases the <lb/>expression of δ-GABA A -Rs. Conversely, knockdown of TTR in cerebellar granule cells signifi-<lb/>cantly downregulates the normally high expression level of δ-GABA A -Rs. The δ-GABA A -Rs <lb/>are the major subtype of extrasynaptic GABA A -Rs and play an important role of tonic inhibi-<lb/>tion to regulate neuronal excitability in the brain [9]. Our recent work demonstrated that <lb/>increasing extrasynaptic δ-GABA A -Rs in cortical neurons will result in a significant decrease <lb/>of synaptic GABA transmission, suggesting a homeostatic competition between tonic and pha-<lb/>sic GABA inhibition [3]. The potent regulation of TTR on the δ-GABA A -Rs suggests that TTR <lb/>may play a role in modulating the tonic inhibition and thus tilting the balance between tonic <lb/>and phasic inhibition. Indeed, we have demonstrated that overexpression of TTR can signifi-<lb/>cantly increase tonic current, whereas knockdown of TTR can significantly decrease tonic cur-<lb/>rent. Thus, besides its normal function of transporting thyroid hormone and retinol, our <lb/>studies suggest that TTR may have a completely different function in regulating GABA inhibi-<lb/>tion in the brain. <lb/>Previous studies have reported that TTR also binds to amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and thus may <lb/>play a role in Aβ clearance in Alzheimer&apos;s disease brain [21, 22]. On the other hand, TTR itself <lb/></body>

			<body>may form aggregates and lead to systemic amyloidosis [40, 41]. Recent biochemical analysis <lb/>suggested that in vivo it is likely the tetrameric TTR that binds to Aβ monomers and inhibits <lb/>Aβ aggregation [22, 42]. This is consistent with our finding that TTR tetramer, not monomer, <lb/>regulates the expression level of the δ-GABA A -Rs. Interestingly, TTR has been reported to be <lb/>involved in cognition during aging [43] and associated with depression [44]. GABA A -Rs are <lb/>known to play an important role in cognitive functions and are involved in mood disorders [7, <lb/>9, 45]. Whether the function of TTR in cognition and depression is mediated by the regulation <lb/>of the δ-GABA A -Rs reported here will be an interesting topic to explore in future studies. <lb/></body>
