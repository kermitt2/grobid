Mustafa; mujahedibrahim44@gmail.com <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December <lb/>2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus <lb/>designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the <lb/>outbreak of a &quot;public-health emergency of international concern&quot; due to the rapid and increasing <lb/>spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this <lb/>emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine <lb/>against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach. <lb/>Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and <lb/>comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for <lb/>designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as <lb/>a target. <lb/>Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative <lb/>sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC <lb/>class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world <lb/>population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. <lb/>Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope <lb/>protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be <lb/>validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this <lb/>epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks. <lb/>Keywords: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Envelope protein, Emerging infection, Epitope-<lb/>based vaccine, Immunoinformatics approach. <lb/>. <lb/>CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license <lb/>author/funder.

			<body>1. Introduction: <lb/>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the <lb/>common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) <lb/>and severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). In the last decades, six strains of <lb/>coronaviruses were identified, however in December 2019; a new strain has been spread across <lb/>Wuhan City, China [1, 2]. It was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the <lb/>World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a <lb/>global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the COVID-19 spreading fast <lb/>outside China, most significantly in South Korea, Italy and Iran with over 2,924 deaths and <lb/>85,212 cases confirmed while 39,537 recovered at 29 February 2020, 06:05 AM (GMT). <lb/>COVID-19 is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA). Its RNA sequence is <lb/>approximately 30,000 bases in length [4]. It belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Genus <lb/>Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. The corona envelope (E) protein is a small, <lb/>integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus&apos; life cycle, such as <lb/>pathogenesis, envelope formation, assembly and budding; alongside with its interactions with <lb/>both other CoVs proteins (M, N &amp; S) and host cell proteins (release of infectious particles after <lb/>budding) [5-9]. <lb/>The infected person characterized with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or <lb/>diarrhoea, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate <lb/>dehydrogenase levels or combination of all these within 3-6 days after exposure. Further <lb/>molecular diagnosis can be made by Real Time-PCR for genes encoding the internal RNA-<lb/>dependent RNA polymerase and Spike&apos;s receptor binding domain, which can be confirmed by <lb/>Sanger sequencing and full genome analysis by NGS, multiplex nucleic acid amplification and <lb/>microarray-based assays [10-14] <lb/>A phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses is possible to reconstruct with a <lb/>sufficient number of sequenced genomes. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that COVID-19 is <lb/>likely originated from bats [15]. It also showed that is highly related with at most seven <lb/>mutations relative to a common ancestor [16]. <lb/>The sequence of COVID-19 RBD, together with its RBM that contacts receptor angiotensin-<lb/>converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found similar to that of SARS coronavirus. On January 2020, <lb/>a group of scientists demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for COVID-19 [17-21]. <lb/></body>

			<body>However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at <lb/>2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous <lb/>interactions with human ACE2 [15]. This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel <lb/>coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses. <lb/>At present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but Chinese traditional <lb/>medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be possible <lb/>treatments for COVID-19. However, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy <lb/>for these drugs [22]. <lb/>The main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune <lb/>response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. Although traditional vaccines, which depend <lb/>on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized <lb/>animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of <lb/>pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24]. Thus the need for safe and <lb/>efficacious vaccines is highly recommended. <lb/>Peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their <lb/>selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26]. The core mechanism of the <lb/>peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell <lb/>epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. B-cell epitope of <lb/>a target molecule can be linked with a T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell <lb/>epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be <lb/>proteins [27, 28]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict <lb/>epitopes from corona envelope (E) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29-34]. While <lb/>rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a <lb/>peptide vaccine against this emerging infection. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2. The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT): <lb/>ACT is an in silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genome <lb/>sequences and associated annotations [35]. It is also applied to identify regions of similarity, <lb/>rearrangements and insertions at any level from base-pair differences to the whole genome. <lb/>(https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act). <lb/>2.3. VaxiJen server: <lb/>It is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It allows antigen <lb/>classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to <lb/>sequence alignment. It predicts the probability of the antigenicity one or multiple of protein <lb/>based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequence. Structural CoV-2019 <lb/>protein (N,S,E and M) was analyzed by VaxiJen with threshold of 0.4 [36]. (http://www.ddg-<lb/>pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) <lb/>2.4. BioEdit: <lb/>It is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence <lb/>operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations. The sequences of E protein were <lb/>retrieved from UniProt were run in BioEdit to determine the conserved sites through ClustalW in <lb/>the application settings [37]. <lb/>2.5. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA): <lb/>MEGA (version 10.1.6) is software for the comparative analysis of molecular sequences. It is <lb/>used for pairwise and multiple sequences alignment alongside construction and analysis of <lb/>phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. The gap penalty was 15 for opening and 6.66 <lb/>for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequences alignment. Bootstrapping of 300 <lb/>was used in construction of maximum like hood phylogenetic tree [38, 39]. <lb/>(https://www.megasoftware.net). <lb/>2.6. Prediction of T-cell epitopes: <lb/>IEDB tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mersequence) from HLA class I <lb/>and class II T-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ANN) approach [40-42]. Artificial <lb/>Neural Network (ANN) version 2.2 was chosen as Prediction method as it depends on the <lb/>median inhibitory concentration (IC50) [40, 43-45]. For the binding analysis, all the alleles were <lb/>carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. Analysis of epitopes <lb/>binding to MHC class I and II molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC prediction server at <lb/>(http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), respectively. All conserved <lb/>immunodominant peptides binding to MHC I and II molecules at score equal or less than 100 <lb/>median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and 1000, respectively were selected for further analysis <lb/>while epitopes with IC50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46]. <lb/></body>

			<body>2.7. Population coverage analysis: <lb/>Population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the IEDB population coverage <lb/>calculation tool. Due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different HLA allele, the most <lb/>promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the whole world, <lb/>China and Europe population to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48]. <lb/>(http://tools.iedb.org/population/) <lb/>2.8. Tertiary structure (3D) Modeling: <lb/>The reference sequence of E protein that has been retrieved from gene bank was used as an input <lb/>in RaptorX to predict the 3D structure of E protein [49, 50], the visualization of the obtained 3D <lb/>protein structure was performed in UCSF Chimera (version1.8) [51]. <lb/>2.9. In silico Molecular Docking: <lb/>2.9.1. Ligand Preparation: <lb/>In order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and molecular structure of MHC I <lb/>and MHC II, in silico molecular docking were used. Sequences of proposed epitopes were <lb/>selected from COVID-19 reference sequence using UCSF Chimera 1.10 and saved as a PDB file. <lb/>The obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. The HLA-A*02:01 was selected <lb/>as the macromolecule for docking. Its crystal structure (4UQ3) was downloaded from the RCSB <lb/>Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an <lb/>azobenzene-containing peptide [52]. <lb/>All water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4UQ3 were then removed. <lb/>Target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using Swiss PDB viewer V.4.1.0 <lb/>software[53]. <lb/>2.9.2. Molecular docking <lb/>Molecular docking was performed using Autodock 4.0 software, based on Lamarckian Genetic <lb/>Algorithm; which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the <lb/>suitable binding position for a ligand on a given protein[54,55]Polar hydrogen atoms were added <lb/>to the protein targets and Kollman united atomic charges were computed. The target&apos;s grid map <lb/>was calculated and set to 60×60×60 points with grid spacing of 0.375 Ǻ. The grid box was then <lb/>allocated properly in the target to include the active residue in the center. The genetic algorithm <lb/>and its run were set to 100.The docking algorithms were set to default. Finally, results were <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Discussion: <lb/>Designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of <lb/>disease [56-59]. In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the <lb/>understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards <lb/>rational vaccines design [60]. Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular <lb/>pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [61].Applying the <lb/>advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed <lb/>where the peptides act as ligands [62-64]. This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis <lb/>encephalitis virus [65], dengue virus [66], chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides <lb/>for designing vaccines. <lb/>The COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses <lb/>[68]. These mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make COVID-19 more superior <lb/>than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot <lb/>[69]. <lb/>In our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against <lb/>COVID-19 (Fig. 1). In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by <lb/>comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [70]. Artemis <lb/>Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference <lb/>sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation <lb/>among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 <lb/>which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission <lb/>[71]. High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp <lb/>to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus <lb/>which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) <lb/>protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73]. <lb/>These conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment <lb/>between MERS-CoV and Bat-coronavirus [74] and analyzed in SARS-CoV [75]. <lb/>The four proteins were then analyzed by Vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic <lb/>proteins. Protein E was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as <lb/>shown in Table 1. Literature survey confirmed this result in which protein E was investigated in <lb/>severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory <lb/></body>

			<body>syndrome (MERS) [72]. Furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains <lb/>was tested and confirmed through the use of BioEdit package tool (Fig. 3). <lb/>As phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship <lb/>between strains. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the <lb/>seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19(NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859), <lb/>MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoV-<lb/>NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree <lb/>revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV, thus the two strains are <lb/>highly related to each other (Fig. 4). <lb/>The immune response of T cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B cell, <lb/>where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [76]. Vaccines that <lb/>effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading <lb/>pathogen. Moreover the CD8+ T and CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral <lb/>immunity [77]. Thus designing vaccine against T cell is much more important. <lb/>Choosing protein E as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to MHC molecules was then <lb/>evaluated. The protein reference sequence was submitted to IEDB MHC predication tool. 21 <lb/>peptides were found to bind MHC class I with different affinities (Table 1), from which ten <lb/>peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population <lb/>percentage (Table 2; Fig. 5).Analysis in IEDB MHC II binding prediction tool resulted in <lb/>prediction of 61 peptides (Table 2), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design <lb/>based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 3; Fig.5). Unfortunately, <lb/>IEDB did not give any result for B cell epitopes, this might be due to the length of the COVID-<lb/>19 (75 amino acids). <lb/>It is well known that peptides recognized with high number of HLA molecules are potentially <lb/>inducing immune response. Based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration <lb/>the high binding affinity to both MHC classes I and II, conservancy and population coverage, <lb/>three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against COVID-19. <lb/>These findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the <lb/>proposed peptides and HLA-A*02:01. The formed complex between MHC molecule and the <lb/>three peptides (YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL) have shown peptide amino-and <lb/>carboxyl-termini forming one and three hydrogen bonds, respectively at the two ends of a binding <lb/></body>

			<body>groove with MHC residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3 <lb/>kcal/mol, respectively (Fig.6C, D and E). <lb/>Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, <lb/>and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have <lb/>apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 [78,79]; nevertheless more studies <lb/>are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the <lb/>development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines <lb/>where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80-86]. To best of our <lb/>knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates <lb/>for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes <lb/>vaccine candidate against T cell. <lb/>5. Conclusion: <lb/>Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in COVID-19 strain using the <lb/>comparative sequencing. In addition, a number of MHC class I and II related peptides were <lb/>found promising candidates. Among which the peptides YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and <lb/>LAILTALRL show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population <lb/>coverage. T cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope <lb/>protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be <lb/>validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this <lb/>epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks. <lb/></body>
