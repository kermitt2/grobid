			<body>instrumentation as well as data and image processing capabilities. In many cases, this can be <lb/>accomplished in vivo. Advances in retinal imaging are made possible through interactions <lb/>between the vision and optics communities, something that the Optical Society of America <lb/>has staunchly supported throughout its history. Reflecting the continued commitment to this <lb/>field, we were invited by the editors at Biomedical Optics Express to organize a feature issue <lb/>highlighting recent advances in the field of Cellular Imaging of the Retina. We were quite <lb/>pleased with the response (outlined below), and believe the assembled feature issue <lb/>appropriately captures the current state of the field. <lb/>The 14 papers in this issue span many disciplines, including clinical imaging, new <lb/>instrumentation, image analysis, imaging in animal models, and functional retinal imaging. <lb/>Reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of this field, most papers fit in multiple categories, and <lb/>here we provide a brief précis of the entire issue. <lb/>Using a variety of imaging techniques, the majority of the papers examined the human <lb/>retina. Among the imaging tools used to acquire retinal images were stand-alone and <lb/>adaptive-optics enhanced: scanning laser ophthalmoscopy/scanning ophthalmoscopy <lb/>(AOSLO/AOSO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus imaging. Adaptive optics <lb/>(AO) has opened numerous avenues of research in cellular resolution retinal imaging, thus it <lb/>is no surprise that we find AO at the heart of many of the papers in this feature issue. <lb/>Dubra et al. [1], Zawadzki et al. [2], Manzanera et al. [3], and Vohnsen and Rativa [4] <lb/>introduced new instrumentation for imaging the photoreceptor mosaic using a broadband <lb/>AOSO, an integrated AO-OCT SLO, a new MEMS-based AOSLO, and an annular-<lb/>illumination SLO, respectively. What we take away from these papers is that there is a <lb/>continued drive to improve the technology even further, which must occur in parallel to robust <lb/>application of existing imaging tools to studying the retina in order to keep the field moving <lb/>forward at its current pace. <lb/>Four additional papers examined structural and functional properties of the photoreceptor <lb/>mosaic. Kacaoglu et al. [5] examined spatial and temporal evaluation of individual cone <lb/>photoreceptors using AO-OCT. Rativa and Vohnsen [6] probed the directionality of cone <lb/>photoreceptors at different retinal eccentricities using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Dees et <lb/>al. [7] examined variability in parafoveal cone density in normal trichromatic individuals <lb/>using a high-speed flood-illuminated AO fundus camera. Dubra et al. [8] move beyond cones <lb/>and demonstrate striking images of the rod photoreceptor mosaic at various retinal locations <lb/>using a newly developed confocal AOSO. <lb/>Moving to clinical imaging, Tam et al. [9] developed a method to characterize capillary <lb/>flow dynamics in the living human retina using an AOSLO, something which could be quite <lb/>valuable for studying certain retinal diseases. In glaucoma patients, Hood and Raza [10] <lb/>provide a method for comparing functional visual field defects to local nerve fiber and retinal <lb/>ganglion cell damage seen on OCT. Hood et al. [11] present a method to define visual field <lb/>boundaries from an analysis of the inner segment/outer segment border in OCT images of <lb/>patients with retinitis pigmentosa. While the image resolution in these latter cases is not <lb/>cellular, the approach provides a key step forward in linking retinal structure with function, <lb/>and could be extended to some of the cellular imaging techniques described in this feature <lb/>issue. <lb/>The final three papers applied high-resolution imaging techniques to animal models. <lb/>Moayed et al. [12] provide volumetric imaging of the chicken retina in vivo using spectral <lb/>domain OCT. Also in the chicken, but ex vivo, Bueno et al. [13] developed an AO <lb/>multiphoton microscope for examining multiple retinal layers. Lu et al. [14] examined the <lb/>cellular sources of autofluorescence in freshly isolated frog retinas using a two-photon <lb/>excitation fluorescence microscope. Ultimately, there are questions that just can&apos;t be <lb/>addressed by imaging the human retina, and animal models will continue to be needed. As <lb/>such, adaptation and development of cellular imaging systems for use in various animal <lb/>preparations remains an area of need in this field. <lb/></body>
