In cancer, the majority of <lb/>missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates <lb/>the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation <lb/>inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase <lb/>mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We <lb/>find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved <lb/>kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in <lb/>binding free energy changes of 1.1 1.2 <lb/>0.9 kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations <lb/>as resistant or susceptible with 89 94 <lb/>83 % accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this <lb/>benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment <lb/>and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications. <lb/></front>

			<body>Targeted kinase inhibitors are a major therapeutic class in the treatment of cancer. A total of 38 selective <lb/>small molecule kinase inhibitors have now been approved by the FDA [1], including 34 approved to treat <lb/>cancer, and perhaps 50% of all current drugs in development target kinases [2]. Despite the success of <lb/>selective inhibitors, the emergence of drug resistance remains a challenge in the treatment of cancer [3-10] <lb/>and has motivated the development of second-and then third-generation inhibitors aimed at overcoming <lb/>recurrent resistance mutations [11-15]. <lb/>While a number of drug resistance mechanisms have been identified in cancer (e.g., induction of splice <lb/>variants [16], or alleviation of feedback [17]), inherent or acquired missense mutations in the kinase domain <lb/>of the target of therapy are a major form of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) [10, 18, 19]. Oncology <lb/>is entering a new era with major cancer centers now deep sequencing tumors to reveal genetic alterations <lb/>that may render subclonal populations susceptible or resistant to targeted inhibitors [20], but the use of <lb/>this information in precision medicine has lagged behind. It would be of enormous value in clinical practice <lb/>if an oncologist could reliably ascertain whether these mutations render the target of therapy resistant or <lb/>susceptible to available inhibitors; such tools would facilitate the enrollment of patients in mechanism-based <lb/></body>

Clinical cancer mutations may impact drug response through a variety of mechanisms <lb/>by altering kinase activity, ATP affinity, substrate specificities, and the ability to participate in regulatory <lb/>interactions, compounding the difficulties associated with limited datasets that machine learning approaches <lb/>face. In parallel with computational approaches, high-throughput experimental techniques such as MITE-<lb/>Seq [24] have been developed to assess the impact of point mutations on drug response.

			<body>rigorously, including all relevant entropic and enthalpic contributions [28]. Encouragingly, kinase:inhibitor <lb/>binding affinities have been predicted using alchemical free-energy methods with mean unsigned errors of <lb/>1.0 kcal/mol for CDK2, JNK1, p38, and Tyk2 [29, 30]. Beyond kinases, alchemical approaches have predicted <lb/>the binding affinity of BRD4 inhibitors with mean absolute errors of 0.6 kcal/mol [31]. Alchemical methods <lb/>have also been observed to have good accuracy (0.6 kcal/mol mean unsigned error for Tyk2 tyrosine kinase) <lb/>in the prediction of relative free energies for ligand transformations within a complex whose receptor <lb/>geometry was generated using a homology model [32]. <lb/>Alchemical approaches can predict the impact of protein mutations on free energy <lb/>Alchemical free-energy calculations have also been used to predict the impact of mutations on protein-<lb/>protein binding [33] and protein thermostabilities [34]. Recent work has found that protein mutations can <lb/>be predicted to be stabilizing or destabilizing with a classification accuracy of 71% across ten proteins and 62 <lb/>mutations [35]. The impact of Gly to D-Ala mutations on protein stability was predicted using an alchemical <lb/>approach with a similar level of accuracy [36]. Recently, one study has hinted at the potential utility of <lb/>alchemical free-energy calculations in oncology by predicting the impact of a single clinical mutation on the <lb/>binding free energies of the TKIs dasatinib and RL45 [37]. <lb/>Assessing the potential for physical modeling to predict resistance to FDA-approved TKIs <lb/>Here, we ask whether physical modeling techniques may be useful in predicting whether clinically-identified <lb/>kinase mutations lead to drug resistance or drug sensitivity. We perform state-of-the-art relative alchemical <lb/>free-energy calculations using FEP+ [29], recently demonstrated to achieve sufficiently good accuracy to drive <lb/>the design of small-molecule inhibitors for a broad range of targets during lead optimization [28-30, 38]. We <lb/>compare this approach against a fast but approximate physical modeling method implemented in Prime [39] <lb/>(an MM-GBSA approach) in which an implicit solvent model is used to assess the change in minimized <lb/>interaction energy of the ligand with the mutant and wild-type kinase. We consider whether these methods <lb/>can predict a ten-fold reduction in inhibitor affinity (corresponding to a binding free energy change of 1.36 <lb/>kcal/mol) to assess baseline utility. As a benchmark, we compile a set of reliable inhibitor binding data for <lb/>144 clinically-identified mutants of the human kinase Abl, an important oncology target dysregulated in <lb/>cancers like chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), for which six [1] FDA-approved TKIs are available. The <lb/>results of this benchmark demonstrate the potential for FEP+ to predict the impact that mutations in Abl <lb/>kinase have on drug binding, and a classification accuracy of 89 94 <lb/>83 % (for all statistical metrics reported in this <lb/>paper, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) is shown in the form of ( <lb/>)), an RMSE of 1.1 1.2 <lb/>0.9 kcal/mol, and an <lb/>MUE of 0.76 0.88 <lb/>0.65 kcal/mol was achieved. <lb/>Results <lb/>Free energy calculations can recapitulate the impact of clinical mutations on TKI affinity <lb/>Alchemical free-energy calculations utilize a physics-based approach to estimate the free energy of transform-<lb/>ing one chemical species into another, incorporating all enthalpic and entropic contributions in a physically <lb/>consistent manner [28, 40-42]. While relative alchemical free-energy calculations have typically been em-<lb/>ployed in optimizing small molecules for increased potency or selectivity [29, 38, 42, 43], a complementary <lb/>alchemical approach can be used to compute the impact of point mutations on ligand binding affinities. <lb/>Figure 1b depicts the thermodynamic cycle that illustrates how we used relative free energy calculations to <lb/>compute the change in ligand binding free energy in response to the introduction of a point mutation in the <lb/>kinase. In the bound leg of the cycle, the wild-type protein:ligand complex is transformed into the mutant <lb/>protein:ligand complex. In the unbound leg of the cycle, the apo protein is transformed from wild-type into <lb/>mutant. To achieve reliable predictions with short relative free-energy calculations, a reliable receptor:ligand <lb/>complex structure is required with the assumption that the binding mode to wild-type and mutant are <lb/>similar. In this work, high-resolution co-crystal structures of wild-type Abl bound to an inhibitor were utilized <lb/>when available. To assess the potential for using docked inhibitor poses, we also examined two systems for <lb/>which co-crystal structures were not available (Abl:erlotinib and Abl:gefitinib) and used docking to generate <lb/>initial coordinates. <lb/></body>

For added <lb/>diversity, this set includes TKIs for which Abl is not the primary target-axitinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib. <lb/>Experimental ΔpIC 50 measurements for wild-type and mutant Abl were converted to ΔΔG in order <lb/>to make direct comparisons between physics-based models and experiment. However, computation <lb/>of experimental uncertainties were required to understand the degree to which differences between <lb/>predictions and experimental data were significant. Since experimental error estimates for measured IC 50 s <lb/>were not available for the data in Table 1, we compared that data to other sources that have published <lb/>IC 50 s for the same mutations in the presence of the same TKIs (Figure 2a,b,c). Cross-comparison of 97 <lb/>experimentally measured ΔΔGs derived from cell viability assay IC 50 data led to an estimate of experimental <lb/>variability of 0.32 0.36 <lb/>0.28 kcal/mol root-mean square error (RMSE) that described the expected repeatability of <lb/>the measurements. Because multiple factors influence the IC 50 aside from direct effects on the binding <lb/>affinity-the focus of this study-we also compared ΔΔGs derived from ΔpIC 50 s with those derived from <lb/>binding affinity measurements (ΔK ) for which data for a limited set of 27 mutations was available (Figure 2d); <lb/>the larger computed RMSE of 0.81 1.04 <lb/>0.59 kcal/mol represents an estimate of the lower bound of the RMSE to <lb/>the IC 50 -derived ΔΔGs that we might hope to achieve with FEP+ or Prime when comparing sample statistics <lb/>directly. <lb/>Most clinical mutations do not significantly reduce TKI potency <lb/>The majority of mutations do not lead to resistance by our 10-fold affinity loss threshold: 86.3% of the <lb/>co-crystal set (n=113) and 86.8% of the total set (n=125).

Figure 3 summarizes the performances in predicted binding free-energy changes (ΔΔG) for all <lb/>131 mutants in this set for both a fast MM-GBSA physics-based method that only captures interaction <lb/>energies for a single structure (Prime) and rigorous alchemical free-energy calculations (FEP+). Scatter plots <lb/>compare experimental and predicted free-energy changes (ΔΔG) and characterize the ability of these two <lb/>techniques to predict experimental measurements. Statistical uncertainty in the predictions and experiment-<lb/>to-experiment variability in the experimental values are shown as ellipse height and widths respectively. <lb/>The value for experimental variability was 0.32 kcal/mol, which was the standard error computed from the <lb/>cross-comparison in Figure 2. For FEP+, the uncertainty was taken to be the standard error of the average <lb/>from three independent runs for a particular mutation, while Prime results are deterministic and are not <lb/>contaminated by statistical uncertainty (see Methods). <lb/>To better assess whether discrepancies between experimental and computed ΔΔ s simply arise for <lb/>known forcefield limitations or might indicate more significant effects, we incorporated an additional error <lb/>model in which the forcefield error was taken to be a random error FF ≈ 0.9 kcal/mol, a value established <lb/>form previous benchmarks on small molecules absent conformational sampling or protonation state <lb/>issues [25]. Thin error bars in Figure 2 represent the overall estimated error due to both this forcefield error <lb/>and experimental variability or statistical uncertainty. <lb/>To assess overall quantitative accuracy, we computed both root-mean-squared error (RMSE)-which is <lb/>rather sensitive to outliers, and mean unsigned error (MUE). For Prime, the MUE was 1.19 1.43 <lb/>0.93 kcal/mol and <lb/>the RMSE was 1.75 2.04 <lb/>1.45 kcal/mol. FEP+, the alchemical free-energy approach, achieved a significantly higher <lb/>level of quantitative accuracy with an MUE of 0.79 0.92 <lb/>0.66 kcal/mol and an RMSE of 1.08 1.29 <lb/>0.89 kcal/mol. Notably, <lb/>alchemical free energy calculations come substantially closer than MMGBSA approach to the minimum <lb/>achievable RMSE of 0.81 1.04 <lb/>0.59 kcal/mol (due to experimental error; Figure 2) for this dataset. <lb/></body>

			<body>How accurately can physical modeling classify mutations as susceptible or resistant? <lb/>While quantitative accuracy (MUE, RMSE) is a principle metric of model performance, an application of <lb/>potential interest is the ability to classify mutations as causing resistance to a specific TKI. To characterize the <lb/>accuracy with which Prime and FEP+ classified mutations in a manner that might be therapeutically relevant, <lb/>we classified mutations by their experimental impact on the binding affinity as susceptible (affinity for mutant <lb/>is diminished by no more than 10-fold, ΔΔ ≤ 1.36 kcal/mol) or as resistant (affinity for mutant is diminished <lb/>by least 10-fold, ΔΔ &gt; 1.36 kcal/mol). Summary statistics of experimental and computational predictions of <lb/>these classes are shown in Figure 2 (bottom) as truth tables (also known as confusion matrices). <lb/>The simple minimum-energy scoring method Prime correctly classified 9 of the 18 resistance mutations <lb/>in the dataset while merely 83 of the 113 susceptible mutations were correctly classified (30 false positives). <lb/>In comparison, the alchemical free-energy method FEP+, which includes entropic and enthalpic contributions <lb/>as well as explicit representation of solvent, correctly classified 9 of the 18 resistance mutations while a <lb/>vast majority, 107, of the susceptible mutations were correctly classified (merely 6 false positives). Prime <lb/>achieved a classification accuracy of 0.70 0.78 <lb/>0.63 , while FEP+ achieved an accuracy that is significantly higher (both <lb/>in a statistical sense and in overall magnitude), achieving an accuracy of 0.89 0.93 <lb/>0.83 . Sensitivity (also called true <lb/>positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) are also informative statistics in assessing the performance of <lb/>a binary classification scheme. For Prime, the sensitivity was 0.50 0.75 <lb/>0.27 , while the specificity was 0.73 0.81 <lb/>0.65 . To put <lb/>this in perspective, a CML patient bearing a resistance mutation in the kinase domain of Abl has an equal <lb/>chance of Prime correctly predicting this mutation would be resistant to one of the TKIs considered here, <lb/>while if the mutation was susceptible, the chance of correct prediction would be ∼73%. By contrast, the <lb/>classification sensitivity and specificity of FEP+ are substantially better. For FEP+, the sensitivity was 0.50 0.71 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>while the specificity was 0.95 0.98 <lb/>0.90 . There is a very high probability that FEP+ will correctly predict that one of <lb/>the eight TKIs studied here will remain effective for a patient bearing a susceptible mutation. <lb/>How sensitive are classification results to choice of cutoff? <lb/>Previous work by [49] utilized TKI-specific thresholds for dasatinib, imatinib, and nilotinib [49], which were <lb/>∼2 kcal/mol. Supplementary Figure 6 shows that when our classification threshold was increased to a <lb/>20-fold change in binding (1.77 kcal/mol), FEP+ correctly classified 8 of the 13 resistant mutations and with <lb/>a threshold of 100-fold change in binding (2.72 kcal/mol), FEP+ correctly classified the only two resistant <lb/>mutations (T315I/dasatinib and T315I/nilotinib). With the extant multilayered and multinodal decision-<lb/>making algorithms used by experienced oncologists to manage their patients&apos; treatment, or by medicinal <lb/>chemists to propose candidate compounds for clinical trials, the resistant or susceptible cutoffs could be <lb/>selected with more nuance than the simple 10-fold affinity threshold we consider here. With a larger affinity <lb/>change cutoff, for example, the accuracy with which physical models predict resistance mutations increases <lb/>beyond 90% (Figure 6). For the alchemical approach, the two-class accuracy was 0.93 0.97 <lb/>0.89 when an affinity <lb/>change cutoff of 20-fold was used while using an affinity change cutoff of 100-fold further improved the <lb/>two-class accuracy to 0.98 1.00 <lb/>0.96 . <lb/>Bayesian analysis can estimate the true error <lb/>The statistical metrics-MUE, RMSE, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity-discussed above are based on <lb/>analysis of the apparent performance of the observed modeling results compared with the observed <lb/>experimental data via sample statistics. However, this analysis considers a limited number of mutants, <lb/>and both measurements and computed values are contaminated with experimental or statistical error. <lb/>To obtain an estimate of the intrinsic performance of our physical modeling approaches, accounting for <lb/>known properties of the experimental variability and statistical uncertainties, we used a hierarchical Bayesian <lb/>model (detailed in the Methods) to infer posterior predictive distributions from which expectations and 95% <lb/>predictive intervals could be obtained. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 3 (central tables). <lb/>FEP+ is significantly better than Prime at predicting the impact of mutations on TKI binding affinities, as the <lb/>apparent performance (using the original observations) as well as the intrinsic performance (where Bayesian <lb/>analysis was used to correct for statistical uncertainty or experimental variation) were well-separated outside <lb/>their 95% confidence intervals in nearly all metrics.

			<body>FEP+ was 0.77 0.89 <lb/>0.66 kcal/mol and 0.96 1.11 <lb/>0.83 kcal/mol respectively (N=129). For the classification metrics accuracy, <lb/>specificity, and sensitivity, the model yields 0.91 0.94 <lb/>0.86 , 0.93 0.95 <lb/>0.90 , and 0.70 1.00 <lb/>0.47 respectively (N=131). The intrinsic <lb/>RMSE and MUE of Prime was 1.78 2.02 <lb/>1.57 kcal/mol and 1.42 1.61 <lb/>1.25 kcal/mol (N=129) respectively, and the classification <lb/>accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity was 0.71 0.75 <lb/>0.68 , 0.73 0.75 <lb/>0.71 , and 0.57 0.77 <lb/>0.38 respectively (N=131). The intrinsic MUE of <lb/>Prime obtained by this analysis is larger than the observed MUE reflecting the non-Gaussian, fat-tailed error <lb/>distributions of Prime results. <lb/>Is the impact of point mutations on drug binding equally well-predicted for the six TKIs? <lb/>The impact of point mutations on drug binding are not equally well predicted for the six TKIs. Figure 4 <lb/>expands the results in Figure 3 on a TKI-by-TKI basis to dissect the particular mutations in the presence of <lb/>a specific TKI. Prime and FEP+ correctly predicted that most mutations in this dataset (N=26) do not raise <lb/>resistance to axitinib, though FEP+ predicted 2 false positives compared with 5 false positives by Prime. The <lb/>MUE and RMSE of FEP+ was excellent for this inhibitor, 0.55 1.09 <lb/>0.52 kcal/mol and 0.76 1.33 <lb/>0.67 kcal/mol respectively. <lb/>While the classification results for bosutinib (N=21) were equally well predicted by Prime as by FEP+, FEP+ was <lb/>still able to achieve superior, but not highly significant, predictive performance for the quantitative metrics <lb/>MUE and RMSE, which were 1.13 2.19 <lb/>0.76 kcal/mol and 1.41 2.74 <lb/>0.99 kcal/mol respectively (FEP+) and 1.13 2.41 <lb/>0.80 kcal/mol <lb/>and 1.80 3.15 <lb/>1.11 kcal/mol respectively (Prime). For dasatinib, FEP+ achieved an MUE and RMSE of 0.76 1.58 <lb/>0.62 kcal/mol <lb/>and 1.07 2.02 <lb/>0.79 kcal/mol respectively whereas the results were, as expected, less quantitatively predictive for <lb/>Prime (N=20). The results for imatinib were similar to those of dasatinib above, where the MUE and RMSE <lb/>for FEP+ were 0.82 1.63 <lb/>0.70 kcal/mol and 1.09 1.96 <lb/>0.91 kcal/mol respectively (N=20). Nilotinib, a derivative of imatinib, <lb/>led to nearly identical quantitative performance results for FEP+ with an MUE and RMSE of 0.82 1.73 <lb/>0.65 kcal/mol <lb/>and 1.06 2.05 <lb/>0.85 kcal/mol respectively (N=21). Similar to axitinib, ponatinib presented an interesting case because <lb/>there were no mutations in this dataset that raised resistance to it, perhaps due to its promiscuous nature <lb/>as a multi-targeted inhibitor. Despite the dynamic range in the computed values of ΔΔG for other inhibitors, <lb/>FEP+ correctly predicted a very narrow range of ΔΔGs for this drug. This is reflected in the MUE and RMSE of <lb/>0.87 1.55 <lb/>0.69 kcal/mol and 1.09 1.96 <lb/>0.86 kcal/mol respectively, which are in-line with the MUEs and RMSEs for the other <lb/>TKIs. <lb/>Understanding the origin of mispredictions <lb/>Resistance mutations that are mispredicted as susceptible (false negatives) are particularly critical because <lb/>they might mislead the clinician or drug designer into believing the inhibitor will remain effective against <lb/>the target. Which resistance mutations did FEP+ mispredict as susceptible? Nine mutations were classified <lb/>by FEP+ to be susceptible when experimentally measured ΔpIC 50 data indicate the mutations should have <lb/>increased resistance according to our 10-fold affinity cutoff for resistance. Notably, the 95% confidence <lb/>intervals for five of these mutations spanned the 1.36 kcal/mol threshold, indicating these misclassifications <lb/>are not statistical significant when the experimental error and statistical uncertainty in FEP+ are accounted for: <lb/>bosutinib/L248R (ΔΔG <lb/>+ =1.32 1.94 <lb/>0.70 kcal/mol), imatinib/E255K (ΔΔG <lb/>+ =0.43 3.05 <lb/>−2.19 kcal/mol), imatinib/Y253F <lb/>(ΔΔG <lb/>+ =0.95 1.64 <lb/>0.26 kcal/mol), and nilotinib/Y253F (ΔΔG <lb/>+ =0.89 1.69 <lb/>0.09 kcal/mol). The bosutinib/V299L mutation <lb/>was also not significant because the experimental ΔΔG, 1.70 2.33 <lb/>1.08 kcal/mol, included the 1.36 kcal/mol cutoff; <lb/>the value of ΔΔG predicted by FEP+ for this mutation was 0.91 1.02 <lb/>0.79 kcal/mol, the upper bound of the predicted <lb/>value was within 0.06 kcal/mol of the lower bound of the experimental value. <lb/>Four mutations, however, were misclassified to a degree that is statistically significant given their 95% con-<lb/>fidence intervals: dasatinib/T315A, bosutinib/T315I, imatinib/E255V, and nilotinib/E255V. For dasatinib/T315A, <lb/>although the T315A mutations for bosutinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib were correctly classified as <lb/>susceptible, the predicted free energy changes for these four TKIs were consistently much more negative <lb/>than the corresponding experimental measurements, just as for dasatinib/T315A, indicating there might be a <lb/>generic driving force contributing to the errors in T315A mutations for these five TKIs. Abl is known to be able <lb/>to adopt many different conformations (including DFG-in and DFG-out), and it is very likely that the T315A <lb/>mutation will induce conformational changes in the apo protein [50], which was not adequately sampled in <lb/>the relatively short simulations, leading to the errors for T315A mutations for these TKIs. By comparison, <lb/>the T315I mutations for axitinib, bosutinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib were all accurately predicted <lb/></body>

			<body>with the exception of bosutinib/T315I being the only misprediction, suggesting an issue specific to bosutinib. <lb/>The complex electrostatic interactions between the 2,4-dichloro-5-methoxyphenyl ring in bosutinib and the <lb/>adjacent positively charge amine of the catalytic Lys271 may not be accurately captured by the fixed-charge <lb/>OPLS3 force field, leading to the misprediction for bosutinib/T315I mutation. <lb/>Insufficient sampling might also belie the imatinib/E255V and nilotinib/E255V mispredictions because <lb/>they reside in the highly flexible P-loop. Since E255V was a charge change mutation, we utilized a workflow <lb/>that included explicit ions (see Methods). The distribution of these ions in the simulation box around the <lb/>solute might not have converged to their equilibrium state on the relatively short timescale of our simulations <lb/>(5 ns), and the insufficient sampling of ion distributions coupled with P-loop might lead to misprediction of <lb/>these two mutations. <lb/>How accurately can the impact of mutations be predicted for docked TKIs? <lb/>To assess the potential for utilizing physics-based approaches in the absence of a high-resolution experimen-<lb/>tal structure, we generated models of Abl bound to two TKIs-erlotinib and gefinitib-for which co-crystal <lb/>structures with wild-type kinase are not currently available. In Figure 5, we show the Abl:erlotinib and <lb/>Abl:gefitinib complexes that were generated using a docking approach (Glide-SP, see Methods). These two <lb/>structures were aligned against the co-crystal structures of EGFR:erlotinib and EGFR:gefinitib to highlight the <lb/>structural similarities between the binding pockets of Abl and EGFR and the TKI binding mode in Abl versus <lb/>EGFR. As an additional test of the sensitivity of FEP+ to system preparation, a second set of Abl:erlotinib and <lb/>Abl:gefitinib complexes was generated in which crystallographic water coordinates were transferred to the <lb/>docked inhibitor structures (see Methods). <lb/>Alchemical free-energy simulations were performed on 13 mutations between the two complexes; 7 <lb/>mutations for erlotinib and 6 mutations for gefitinib. The quantitative accuracy of FEP+ in predicting the <lb/>value of ΔΔG was excellent-MUE and RMSE of 0.58 0.86 <lb/>0.33 kcal/mol and 0.80 1.09 <lb/>0.44 kcal/mol respectively if crystal <lb/>waters are omitted, and 0.50 0.79 <lb/>0.27 kcal/mol and 0.69 0.99 <lb/>0.34 kcal/mol if crystal waters were restored after docking. <lb/>Encouragingly, these results indicate that our initial models of Abl bound to erlotinib and gefitinib were <lb/>reliable because the accuracy and dependability of our FEP+ calculations were not sensitive to crystallographic <lb/>waters. Our secondary concern was the accuracy with which the approach classified mutations as resistant <lb/>or susceptible. <lb/>While the results presented in (Figure 5) indicate that FEP+ is capable of achieving good quantitative <lb/>accuracy when a co-crystal structure is unavailable, it is important to understand why a mutation was <lb/>predicted to be susceptible but was determined experimentally to be resistant. F317I was the one mutation <lb/>that increased resistance to erlotinib (or gefitinib) because it destabilized binding by more than 1.36 kcal/mol-<lb/>1.35 1.67 <lb/>1.03 kcal/mol (gefitinib) and 1.58 1.90 <lb/>1.26 kcal/mol (erlotinib), but the magnitude of the experimental uncertainty <lb/>means we are unable to confidently discern whether this mutation induces more than 10-fold resistance <lb/>to either TKI. Therefore, the one misclassification by FEP+ in Figure 5 is not statistically significant and the <lb/>classification metrics presented there underestimate the nominal performance of this alchemical free-energy <lb/>method. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Physics-based modeling can reliably predict when a mutation elicits resistance to therapy <lb/>The results presented in this work are summarized in Table 2. The performance metrics summarized in <lb/>Table 2 indicates that the set of 131 mutations for the six TKIs in which co-crystal structures were available is <lb/>on par with the complete set (144 mutations), which included results based on Abl:TKI complexes generated <lb/>from docking models. The performance results for the 13 mutations for the two TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) <lb/>in which co-crystal structures were unavailable exhibited good quantitative accuracy (MUE and RMSE) and <lb/>good classification power. <lb/>Overall (N=144), the MM-GBSA approach Prime classified mutations with good accuracy (0.71 0.78 <lb/>0.63 ) and <lb/>specificity (0.74 0.81 <lb/>0.66 ) while the alchemical approach FEP+ was a significant improvement in classification <lb/>accuracy (0.89 0.94 <lb/>0.83 ) and specificity (0.95 0.98 <lb/>0.91 ). The quantitative accuracy with which Prime was able to predict the <lb/>experimentally measured change in Abl:TKI binding (N=142) characterized by RMSE and MUE was 1.73 2.01 <lb/>1.45 <lb/></body>

			<body>correction intended to correct for the truncation of dispersion interactions at finite cutoff, which can induce <lb/>an error in protein-ligand binding free energies that depends on the number of ligand heavy atoms being <lb/>modified [53]; recently, efficient Lennard-Jones PME methods [54, 55] and perturbation schemes [53] have <lb/>been developed that can eliminate the errors associated with this truncation. While the currently employed <lb/>methodology for alchemical transformations involving a change in system charge (see Methods) reduces <lb/>artifacts that depend on the simulation box size and periodic boundary conditions, the explicit ions that were <lb/>included in these simulations may not have sufficiently converged to their equilibrium distributions in these <lb/>relatively short simulations. Kinases and their inhibitors are known to possess multiple titratable sites with <lb/>either intrinsic or effective p s near physiological pH, while the simulations here treat protonation states <lb/>and proton tautomers fixed throughout the bound and unbound states; the accuracy of the model can be <lb/>further improved with the protonation states or tautomers shift upon binding or mutation considered [56, 57]. <lb/>Similarly, some systems display significant salt concentration dependence [58], while the simulations for <lb/>some systems reported here did not rigorously mimic all aspects of the experimental conditions of the cell <lb/>viability assays. <lb/>Experimentally observed IC 50 changes can be caused by other physical mechanisms <lb/>While we have shown that predicting the direct impact of mutations on the binding affinity of ATP-competitive <lb/>tyrosine kinase inhibitors for a single kinase conformation has useful predictive capacity, many additional <lb/>physical effects that can contribute to cell viability are not currently captured by examining only the predicted <lb/>change in inhibitor binding affinity. For example, kinase missense mutations can also shift the populations <lb/>of kinase conformations (which may affect ATP and inhibitor affinities differentially), modulate ATP affinity, <lb/>modulate affinity for protein substrate, or modulate the ability of the kinase to be regulated or bounded <lb/>by scaffolding proteins. These physical mechanisms might affect the IC 50 s of cell viability assays but not <lb/>necessarily the binding affinity of the inhibitors. While many of these effects are in principle tractable by <lb/>physical modeling in general (and alchemical free energy methods in particular), it is valuable to examine our <lb/>mispredictions and outliers to identify whether any of these cases is likely to induce resistance (as observed <lb/>by ΔpIC 50 shifts) by one of these alternative mechanisms. <lb/>Other physical mechanisms of resistance are likely similarly computable. <lb/>A simple threshold of 10-fold TKI affinity change is a crude metric for classifying resistance or susceptibility <lb/>due to the myriad biological factors that contribute to the efficacy of a drug in a person. Except for affecting <lb/>the binding affinity of inhibitors, missense mutations can also cause drug resistance through other physical <lb/>mechanisms including induction of splice variants or alleviation of feedback. While the current study only <lb/>focus on the mutation effect on drug binding affinity, resistance from these other physical mechanisms <lb/>could be similarly computed using physical modeling. For example, some mutations are known to activate <lb/>the kinase by increasing affinity to ATP, which could be computed using the same thermodynamic cycle <lb/>utilized here for inhibitors. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Revolutionary changes in computing power-especially the arrival of inexpensive graphics processors <lb/>(GPUs)-and software automation have enabled alchemical free-energy calculations to impact drug discovery <lb/>and life sciences projects in previously unforeseen ways. In this communication, we tested the hypothesis <lb/>that FEP+, a fully-automated relative-alchemical free-energy workflow, had reached the point where it can <lb/>accurately and reliably predict how clinically-observed mutations in Abl kinase alter the binding affinity of <lb/>eight FDA-approved TKIs. To establish the potential predictive impact of current-generation alchemical free <lb/>energy calculations-which incorporate entropic and enthalpic effects and the discrete nature of aqueous <lb/>solvation-compared to a simpler physics-based approach that also uses modern forcefields but scores a <lb/>single minimized conformation, we employed a second physics-based approach (Prime). This simpler physics-<lb/>based model, which uses an implicit model of solvation to score the energetic changes in interaction energy <lb/>that arise from the mutation, was able to capture a useful amount of information to achieve substantial <lb/>predictiveness with an MUE of 1.15 1.54 <lb/>0.97 kcal/mol (N=142), RMSE of 1.70 2.18 <lb/>1.45 kcal/mol respectively (N=142), and <lb/></body>

			<body>classification accuracy of 0.70 0.82 <lb/>0.63 (N=144). Surpassing these good results, we went on to demonstrate that <lb/>FEP+ is able to achieve superior predictive performance-MUE of 0.76 0.99 <lb/>0.66 kcal/mol (N=142), RMSE of 1.05 1.34 <lb/>0.89 <lb/>kcal/mol (N=142), and classification accuracy of 0.89 0.96 <lb/>0.85 (N=144). While future enhancements to the workflows <lb/>for Prime and FEP+ to account for additional physical and chemical effects are likely to improve predictive <lb/>performance further, the present results are of sufficient quality and achievable on a sufficiently rapid <lb/>timescale (with turnaround times ∼6 hours/calculation) to impact research projects in drug discovery and the <lb/>life sciences. With exponential improvements in computing power, we anticipate the domains of applicability <lb/>for alchemical free-energy methods such as FEP+ will take on increasingly integrated roles to impact projects. <lb/>This work illustrates how the domain of applicability for alchemical free-energy methods is much larger <lb/>than previously appreciated, and might further be found to include new areas as research progresses: <lb/>aiding clinical decision-making in the selection of first-or second-line therapeutics guided by knowledge <lb/>of likely subclonal resistance; identifying other selective kinase inhibitors (or combination therapeis) to <lb/>which the mutant kinase is susceptible; supporting the selection of candidate molecules to advance to <lb/>clinical trials based on anticipated activity against likely mutations; facilitating the enrollments of patients <lb/>in mechanism-based basket trials; and generally augmenting the oncology armamentarium of precision <lb/>oncology. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>System preparation <lb/>All system preparation utilized the Maestro Suite (Schrödinger) version 2016-4. Comparative modeling to add <lb/>missing residues using a homologous template made use of the Splicer tool, while missing loops modeled <lb/>without a template used Prime. All tools employed default settings unless otherwise noted. The Abl wild-type <lb/>sequence used in building all Abl kinase domain models utilized the ABL1_HUMAN Isoform IA (P00519-1) <lb/>UniProt gene sequence spanning S229-K512. We used a residue indexing convention that places the Thr <lb/>gatekeeper residue at position 315 to match common usage; an alternate indexing convention utilized <lb/>in experimental X-ray structures for Abl:imatinib (PDB: 1OPJ) [59] and Abl:dasatinib (PDB: 4XEY) [60] was <lb/>adjusted to match our convention. <lb/>Complexes with co-crystal structures. Chain B of the experimental structure of Abl:axitinib (PDB: <lb/>4WA9) [44] was used, and four missing residues at the N-and C-termini were added using homology modeling <lb/>with PDB 3IK3 [61] as the template following alignment of the remainder of the kinase domain. Chain B was <lb/>selected because chain A was missing an additional 3 and 4 residues at the N-and C-termini, respectively, in <lb/>addition to 3-and 20-residue loops, both of which were resolved in chain B. All missing residues were added <lb/>with Prime. The co-crystal structure of Abl:bosutinib (PDB: 3UE4) [62] was missing 4 and 10 N-and C-terminal <lb/>residues respectively in chain A that were built using homology modeling with 3IK3 as the template. All loops <lb/>were resolved in chain A (chain B was missing two residues in the P-loop, Q252 and Y253). The co-crystal <lb/>structure of Abl:dasatinib (PDB: 4XEY) [60] was missing 2 and 9 N-and C-terminal residues, respectively, that <lb/>were built via homology modeling using 3IK3 as the template. A missing 4-residue was build with Prime. <lb/>The co-crystal structure of Abl:imatinib (PDB: 1OPJ) [59] had no missing loops or N-/C-terminal residues. <lb/>Chain B was used because chain A was missing two C-terminal residues that were resolved in chain B. A <lb/>serine was present at position 336 (index 355 in the PDB file) and was mutated to asparagine using Prime <lb/>to match the human wild-type reference sequence. The co-crystal structure of Abl:nilotinib (PDB: 3CS9) <lb/>[63] contained four chains in the asymmetric unit all of which were missing at least one loop. Chain A was <lb/>selected because its one missing loop involved the fewest number of residues of the four chains; chain A <lb/>was missing 4 and 12 N-and C-terminal residues, respectively, that were built using homology modeling <lb/>with 3IK3 as the template. A 4-residue loop was missing in chain A (chain B and C were missing two loops, <lb/>chain D was missing a five residue loop) that was built using Prime. The co-crystal structure of Abl:ponatinib <lb/>(PDB: 3OXZ) [64] contained only one chain in the asymmetric unit. It had two missing loops, one 4 residues <lb/>(built using Prime) and one 12 residues (built using homology modeling with 3OY3 [64] as the template). <lb/>Serine was present at position 336 and was mutated to Asn using Prime to match the human wild-type <lb/>reference sequence. Once the residue composition of the six Abl:TKI complexes were normalized to have the <lb/>same sequence, the models were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard. Bond orders were assigned <lb/>using the Chemical Components Dictionary and hydrogen atoms were added. Missing side chain atoms <lb/>were built using Prime. Termini were capped with N-acetyl (N-terminus) and N-methyl amide (C-terminus). <lb/>If present, crystallographic water molecules were retained. Residue protonation states (e.g. Asp381 and <lb/>Asp421) were determined using PROPKA [65] with a pH range of 5.0-9.0. Protonation state was assigned <lb/>using PROPKA with pH equal to the experimental assay. Hydrogen bonds were assigned by sampling the <lb/>orientation of crystallographic water, Asn and Gln flips, and His protonation state. The positions of hydrogen <lb/>atoms were minimized while constraining heavy atoms coordinates. Finally, restrained minimization of all <lb/>atoms was performed in which a harmonic positional restraint (25 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) was applied only to heavy <lb/>atoms. Table 3 summarizes the composition of the final models used for FEP. <lb/>Complexes without co-crystal structures. Co-crystal structures of Abl bound to erlotinib or gefitinib <lb/>were not publicly available. To generate models of these complexes, Glide-SP [66] was utilized to dock <lb/>these two compounds into an Abl receptor structure. Co-crystal structures of these two compounds bound <lb/>to EGFR were publicly available and this information was used to obtain initial ligand geometries and to <lb/>establish a reference binding mode against which our docking results could be structurally scored.

			<body>receptor structure bound to bosutinib was used for docking because its structure was structurally similar to <lb/>that of EGFR in the erlotinib-(PDB: 4HJO) [67] and gefitinib-bound (PDB: 4WKQ) [68] co-crystal structures. <lb/>Abl was prepared for docking by using the Protein Preparation Wizard (PPW) with default parameters. <lb/>Crystallographic waters were removed but their coordinates retained for a subsequent step in which they <lb/>were optionally reintroduced. Erlotinib and gefitinib protonation states at pH 7.00±2.00 were determined <lb/>using Epik [69]. Docking was performed using the Glide-SP workflow. The receptor grid was centered on <lb/>bosutinib. The backbone NH of Met318 was chosen to participate in a hydrogen bonding constraint with <lb/>any hydrogen bond donor on the ligand. The hydroxyl of T315 was allowed to rotate in an otherwise rigid <lb/>receptor. Ligand docking was performed with enhanced sampling; otherwise default settings were used. <lb/>Epik state penalties were included in the scoring. The 16 highest ranked (Glide-SP score) poses were retained <lb/>for subsequent scoring. To determine the docked pose that would be subsequently used for free energy <lb/>calculations, the ligand heavy-atom RMSD between the 16 poses and the EGFR co-crystal structures (PDB IDs <lb/>4HJO and 4WKQ) was determined. The pose in which erlotinib or gefitinib most structurally resembled the <lb/>EGFR co-crystal structure (via heavy-atom RMSD) was chosen as the pose for subsequent FEP+. Two sets of <lb/>complex structures were subjected to free energy calculations to determine the effect of crystal waters: In <lb/>the first set, without crystallographic waters, the complexes were prepared using Protein Prep Wizard as <lb/>above. In the second set, the crystallographic waters removed prior to docking were added back, and waters <lb/>in the binding pocket that clashed with the ligand were removed. <lb/>Force field parameter assignment <lb/>The OPLS3 forcefield [25] version that shipped with Schrödinger Suite release 2016-4 was used to parame-<lb/>terize the protein and ligand. Torsion parameter coverage was checked for all ligand fragments using Force <lb/>Field Builder. The only ligand that contained a fragment with a torsion parameter not covered by OPLS3 <lb/>was bosutinib; Force Field Builder was used to obtain these parameters. SPC parameters [70] were used for <lb/>water. For mutations that change the net change of the system, counterions were included to neutralize the <lb/>system with additional Na+ and Cl-ions added to achieve 0.15 M excess to mimic the solution conditions of <lb/>the experimental assay. <lb/>Prime (MM-GBSA) <lb/>Prime was used to predict the geometry of mutant side chains and to calculate relative changes in free energy <lb/>using MM-GBSA single-point estimates [39]. VSGB [71] was used as the implicit solvent model to calculate <lb/>the solvation free energies for the four states (complex/wild-type, complex/mutant, apo protein/wild-type, <lb/>and apo protein/mutant) and ΔΔG calculated using the thermodynamic cycle depicted in Figure 1b. Unlike <lb/>FEP (see below), which simulates the horizontal legs of the thermodynamic cycle, MM-GBSA models the <lb/>vertical legs by computing the interaction energy between the ligand and protein in both wild-type and <lb/>mutant states, subtracting these to obtain the ΔΔG of mutation on the binding free energy. <lb/>Alchemical free energy perturbation calculations using FEP+ <lb/>Alchemical free energy calculations were performed using the FEP+ tool in the Schrödinger Suite version <lb/>2016-4, which offers a fully automated workflow requiring only an input structure (wild-type complex) and <lb/>specification of the desired mutation. The default protocol was used throughout: It assigns protein and <lb/>ligand force field parameters (as above), generates a dual-topology [72] alchemical system for transforming <lb/>wild-type into mutant protein (whose initial structure is modeled using Prime), generates the solvent-leg <lb/>endpoints (wild-type and mutant apo protein), and constructs intermediate windows spanning wild-type <lb/>and mutant states. Charge-conserving mutations utilized 12 windows (24 systems) while charge-changing <lb/>mutations utilized 24 windows (48 systems). Each system was solvated in an orthogonal box of explicit <lb/>solvent (SPC water [70]) with box size determined to ensure that solute atoms were no less than 5 Å (complex <lb/>leg) or 10 Å (solvent leg) from an edge of the box. For mutations that change the net charge of the system, <lb/>counterions were included to neutralize the charge of the system, and additional Na+ and Cl-ions added <lb/>to achieve 0.15 M excess NaCl to mimic the solution conditions of the experimental assay. The artifact <lb/>in electrostatic interactions for charge change perturbations due to periodic boundary conditions in MD <lb/>simulations are corrected based on the method proposed by Rocklin et al. [73]. <lb/></body>

			<body>System equilibration was automated. It followed the default 5-stage Desmond protocol: (i) 100 ps with <lb/>1 fs time steps of Brownian dynamics with positional restraints of solute heavy atoms to their initial geometry <lb/>using a restraint force constant of 50 kcal/mol/Å 2 ; (ii) 12 ps MD simulations with 1 fs time step using Langevin <lb/>thermostat at 10 K with constant volume, using the same restraints; (iii) 12 ps MD simulations with 1 fs <lb/>time step using Langevin thermostat and barostat [74] at 10 K and constant pressure of 1 atmosphere, <lb/>using the same restraints; (iv) 12 ps MD simulations with 1 fs time step using Langevin thermostat and <lb/>barostat at 300 K and constant pressure of 1 atmosphere, using the same restraints; (v) a final unrestrained <lb/>equilibration MD simulation of 240 ps with 2 fs time step using Langevin thermostat and barostat at 300 K <lb/>and constant pressure of 1 atmosphere. Electrostatic interactions were computed with particle-mesh Ewald <lb/>(PME) [75] and a 9 Å cutoff distance was used for van de Waals interactions. The production MD simulation <lb/>was performed in the NPT ensemble using the MTK method [76] with integration time steps of 4 fs, 4 fs, <lb/>and 8 fs respectively for the bonded, near, and far interactions following the RESPA method [77] through <lb/>hydrogen mass repartitioning [78]. Production FEP+ calculations utilized Hamiltonian replica exchange with <lb/>solute tempering (REST) [79], with automated definition of the REST region. Dynamics were performed with <lb/>constant pressure of 1 atmosphere and constant temperature of 300 K for 5 ns in which exchanges between <lb/>windows was attempted every 1.2 ps. <lb/>Because cycle closure could not be used to reduce statistical errors via path redundancy [79], we <lb/>instead performed mutational free energy calculations in triplicate by initializing dynamics with different <lb/>random seeds. The relative free energies for each mutation in each independent run were calculated using <lb/>BAR [80, 81] The reported ΔΔG was computed as the mean of the computed ΔΔG from three independent <lb/>simulations. Triplicate simulations were performed in parallel using four NIVIDA Pascal Architecture GPUs <lb/>per alchemical free-energy simulation (12 GPUs in total), requiring ∼6 hours in total to compute ΔΔG. <lb/>Obtaining ΔΔG from ΔpIC 50 benchmark set data <lb/>Reference relative free energies were obtained from three publicly available sources of ΔpIC 50 data (Table 1). <lb/>Under the assumption of Michaelis-Menten binding kinetics (pseudo first-order, but relative free energies are <lb/>likely consistent), the inhibitor is competitive with ATP (Equation 1). This assumption has been successfully <lb/>used to estimate relative free energies [37, 82-84] using the relationship between IC 50 and competitive <lb/>inhibitor affinity , <lb/>IC 50 = <lb/>1 + <lb/>[ 0 ] . <lb/>(1) <lb/>If the Michaelis constant for ATP (K ) is much larger than the initial ATP concentration S 0 , the relation in <lb/>Equation 1 will tend towards the equality IC 50 = K . The relative change in binding free energy of Abl:TKI <lb/>binding due to protein mutation is simply, <lb/>ΔΔ = − <lb/>ln <lb/>IC 50, <lb/>IC 50, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where IC 50, <lb/>is the IC 50 value for the TKI binding to the wild-type protein and IC 50, is the IC 50 value for the <lb/>mutant protein. is the ideal gas constant and is taken to be room temperature (300 K). <lb/>Assessing prediction performance <lb/>Quantitative accuracy metrics <lb/>Mean unsigned error (MUE) was calculated by taking the average absolute difference between predicted and <lb/>experimental estimates of ΔΔG. Root-mean square error (RMSE) was calculated by taking the square root <lb/>of the average squared difference between predicted and experimental estimates of ΔΔG. MUE depends <lb/>linearly on errors such that large and small errors contribute equally to the average value, while RMSE <lb/>depends quadratically on errors, magnifying their effect on the average value. <lb/>Truth tables <lb/>Two-class truth tables were constructed to characterize the ability of Prime and FEP+ to correctly classify <lb/>mutations as susceptible (ΔΔG ≤ 1.36 kcal/mol) or resistant (ΔΔG &gt; 1.36 kcal/mol), where the 1.36 kcal/mol <lb/></body>

			<body>threshold represents a 10-fold change in affinity. Accuracy was calculated as the fraction of all predictions <lb/>that were correctly classified as sensitizing, neutral, or resistant. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated <lb/>using a binary classification of resistant (ΔΔG &gt; 1.36 kcal/mol) or susceptible (ΔΔG ≤ 1.36 kcal/mol). Specificity <lb/>was calculated as the fraction of correctly predicted non-resistant mutations out of all truly susceptible <lb/>mutations S. Sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of correctly predicted resistant mutations out of all <lb/>truly resistant mutations, R. The number of susceptible mutations was 113 for axitinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, <lb/>imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib, and 12 for erlotinib and gefitinib; the number of resistant mutations R was <lb/>18 for axitinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, and 1 for erlotinib and gefitinib. <lb/>Estimating uncertainties of physical-modeling results <lb/>95% symmetric confidence intervals (CI, 95%) for all performance metrics were calculated using bootstrap by <lb/>resampling all datasets with replacement, with 1000 resampling events. Confidence intervals were estimated <lb/>for all performance metrics and reported as high <lb/>low where is the mean statistic calculated from the complete <lb/>dataset (e.g. RMSE), and low and high are the values of the statistic at the 2.5 ℎ and 97.5 ℎ percentiles of the <lb/>value-sorted list of the bootstrap samples.Uncertainty for ΔΔGs was computed by the standard deviation <lb/>between three independent runs (using different random seeds to set initial velocities), where the 95% CI <lb/>was [ΔΔG−1.96× FEP+ , ΔΔG+1.96× FEP+ ] kcal/mol. 1 used in plots for FEP+ and experiment; 0 for Prime. <lb/>Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate intrinsic error <lb/>We used Bayesian inference to estimate the true underlying prediction error of Prime and FEP+ by making <lb/>use of known properties of the experimental variability (characterized in Figure 2) and statistical uncertainty <lb/>estimates generated by our calculations under weak assumptions about the character of the error. <lb/>We presume the true free energy differences of mutation , ΔΔ true , comes from a normal background <lb/>distribution of unknown mean and variance, <lb/>ΔΔ true ∼  ( mut , 2 <lb/>mut ) = 1, … , <lb/>(3) <lb/>where there are <lb/>mutations in our dataset. We assign weak priors to the mean and variance <lb/>mut <lb/>∼ <lb/>(−6, +6) <lb/>(4) <lb/>mut <lb/>∝ 1 <lb/>(5) <lb/>where we limit &gt; 0. <lb/>We presume the true computational predictions (absent statistical error) differ from the (unknown) <lb/>true free energy difference of mutation ΔΔ true by normally-distributed errors with zero bias but standard <lb/>deviation equal to the RMSE for either Prime or FEP+, the quantity we are focused on estimating: <lb/>ΔΔ true <lb/>,Prime <lb/>∼  (ΔΔ true , RMSE 2 <lb/>Prime ) <lb/>(6) <lb/>ΔΔ true <lb/>,FEP+ <lb/>∼  (ΔΔ true , RMSE 2 <lb/>FEP+ ) <lb/>(7) <lb/>In the case of Prime, since the computation is deterministic, we actually calculate ΔΔ true <lb/>Prime for each <lb/>mutant. For FEP+, however, the computed free energy changes are corrupted by statistical error, which we <lb/>also presume to be normally distributed with standard deviation calc, , <lb/>ΔΔ ,FEP+ ∼  (ΔΔ ,FEP+ , 2 <lb/>,FEP+ ) <lb/>(8) <lb/>where ΔΔ ,FEP+ is the free energy computed for mutant by FEP+, and ,FEP+ is the corresponding statistical <lb/>error estimate. <lb/>The experimental data we observe is also corrupted by error, which we presume to be normally dis-<lb/>tributed with standard deviation exp : <lb/>ΔΔ ,exp ∼  (ΔΔ , 2 <lb/>exp ) <lb/>(9) <lb/>Here, we used an estimate of -and IC 50 -derived ΔΔ variation derived from the empirical RMSE of 0.81 <lb/>kcal/mol, where we took exp ≈ 0.81∕ <lb/>√ <lb/>2 = 0.57 kcal/mol to ensure the difference between two random <lb/>measurements of the same mutant would have an empirical RMSE of 0.81 kcal/mol. <lb/></body>

			<body>Under the assumption that the true ΔΔ is normally distributed and the calculated value differs from <lb/>the true value via a normal error model, it can easily be shown that the MUE is related to the RMSE via <lb/>MUE = ∫ <lb/>true ( true ) ∫ <lb/>calc ( calc | true ) | calc − true | <lb/>(10) <lb/>= ∫ <lb/>true <lb/>1 <lb/>√ <lb/>2 2 <lb/>true <lb/>− <lb/>( true − true ) 2 <lb/>2 2 <lb/>true <lb/>∫ <lb/>calc <lb/>1 <lb/>√ <lb/>2 2 <lb/>calc <lb/>− <lb/>( calc − true ) 2 <lb/>2 2 <lb/>calc <lb/>| calc − true | <lb/>(11) <lb/>= <lb/>√ <lb/>2 RMSE <lb/>(12) <lb/>The model was implemented using PyMC3 [85], observable quantities were set to their computed or <lb/>experimental values, and 5000 samples drawn from the posterior (after discarding an initial 500 samples to <lb/>burn-in) using the default NUTS sampler.
