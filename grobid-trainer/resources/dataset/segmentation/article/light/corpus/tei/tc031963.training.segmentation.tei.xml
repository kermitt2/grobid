			<front>Tobacco marketing in California and implications for <lb/>the future <lb/>April Roeseler, 1 Ellen C Feighery, 2 Tess Boley Cruz 3 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Background Tobacco marketing influences tobacco use <lb/>initiation, maintenance of use, and it undermines <lb/>comprehensive tobacco control programmes. Policies to <lb/>ban the impact of tobacco marketing are most likely to <lb/>be more effective if they are comprehensive, as partial <lb/>bans shift marketing to non-banned forms of media. A <lb/>comprehensive approach to reducing tobacco marketing <lb/>includes documentation through monitoring, media and <lb/>policy interventions and aggressive enforcement of <lb/>existing laws. <lb/>Methods This paper summarises California tobacco <lb/>industry monitoring of events and retail outlets, and <lb/>findings about exposure to and beliefs about tobacco <lb/>industry marketing among youths and adults conducted <lb/>during the period 2000 through 2008. <lb/>Results There was no overall change in the average <lb/>number of cigarette materials per store, and an increase <lb/>in the percentage of stores with advertisements <lb/>promoting price discounts for cigarettes. Stores with <lb/>cigarette advertisements near candy displays declined <lb/>from 12.5% (95% CI 9.8% to 15.2%) to 1% (95% CI 0.2% <lb/>to 1.9%) of stores, and advertisements at or below the <lb/>eye-level of children declined from 78.6% (95% CI 75.2% <lb/>to 82.0%) to 31% (95% CI 27.1% to 34.9%) of stores. <lb/>Overall, the number of public events with tobacco <lb/>sponsorship declined from 77.3% to 48.1%. This trend <lb/>was consistent with a significant decline noted among <lb/>high school students and adults who reported seeing <lb/>tobacco advertisements at events or attending a tobacco <lb/>company-sponsored event. <lb/>Conclusions Tobacco industry monitoring, media, policy <lb/>and enforcement interventions may have contributed to <lb/>observed changes in tobacco marketing and to declines <lb/>in reported exposure to tobacco marketing. <lb/></front>

			<body>BACKGROUND <lb/>Tobacco industry marketing encompasses planned <lb/>efforts to convince people to desire, buy or support <lb/>tobacco company interests using methods that <lb/>include paid advertising, price promotions, public <lb/>relations and distribution of tobacco products and <lb/>promotional items. 1 These marketing strategies are <lb/>an important factor affecting individual uptake, 2 <lb/>maintenance of tobacco use, and they impact the <lb/>success of comprehensive tobacco control <lb/>programmes in ways that extend beyond its effect <lb/>on individual tobacco users. 3 Exposure to point-of-<lb/>sale tobacco promotions influences susceptibility to <lb/>smoking, smoking initiation, impulse tobacco <lb/>purchases and undermines quitting. 4 5 Price <lb/>promotions undermine the effect of tobacco taxes <lb/>to reduce tobacco consumption and smoking <lb/>prevalence by increasing the affordability of <lb/>tobacco products, 6e9 while political campaign <lb/>contributions, sponsorship, philanthropy and <lb/>corporate responsibility efforts subtly influence <lb/>tobacco-related policy decisions made by elected <lb/>officials, community leaders, constituency groups <lb/>and even juries. 10e16 <lb/>The California Department of Public Health <lb/>(CDPH), California Tobacco Control Program <lb/>(CTCP) has continuously monitored exposure to <lb/>and beliefs about tobacco industry marketing <lb/>among adults and youths through telephone and <lb/>in-school surveys. These population-based surveys <lb/>are supplemented with observational surveys of <lb/>tobacco marketing focused on sponsored events and <lb/>the retail environment. This paper describes Cali-<lb/>fornia&apos;s media and programme interventions to <lb/>stimulate tobacco marketing restrictions; enforce-<lb/>ment of the Master Settlement Agreement i (MSA), <lb/>Smokeless Tobacco Settlement Agreement and <lb/>existing laws; and reports on changes in marketing, <lb/>and adult and youth attitudes about and exposure <lb/>to tobacco industry marketing in California. <lb/>Sponsorship <lb/>Sponsorship occurs when a company pays money <lb/>to an event organiser, site owner or competitor in <lb/>exchange for access to the audience, promotional <lb/>rights and use of the event or property trade-<lb/>marks. 11 It is an important form of marketing <lb/>because it allows tobacco companies to associate <lb/>their name and brands with a desirable lifestyle <lb/>image, people&apos;s pastimes and passions, 17e19 and <lb/>provides tobacco companies the ability to circum-<lb/>vent the 1971 ban on marketing cigarettes in the <lb/>broadcast media. 20 Viewers of tobacco-sponsored <lb/>sporting events have more brand awareness, more <lb/>favourable attitudes towards tobacco use and pref-<lb/>erences for specific tobacco brands. 21 22 Sponsorship <lb/>also occurs at adult-only facilities such as bars, clubs <lb/>and fraternities. These staged marketing opportuni-<lb/>ties usually involve distributing free product samples, <lb/>coupons and promotional items to build brand <lb/>awareness, introduce a new product, encourage <lb/>experimentation, retain and build customer loyalty, <lb/>and generate names for direct mail. 23e25 Attendance <lb/>at these events has been associated with higher <lb/>smoking prevalence among college students. 26 <lb/></body>

			<body>In 2006, US cigarette companies spent $168 million on <lb/>sponsoring public entertainment, and smokeless tobacco <lb/>companies spent $144 000 on this marketing category. Cigarette <lb/>companies reported spending $29 million on free sample distri-<lb/>bution in 2006 while smokeless tobacco companies spent $42 <lb/>million on free samples. 27 28 <lb/>Retail environment <lb/>Retail outlets are an important environment for tobacco <lb/>companies to promote their products, segment the market and <lb/>target groups they might lose such as those thinking about <lb/>quitting or who have recently quit. In-store marketing strategies <lb/>to achieve these goals include point-of-sale advertising, <lb/>payments for prime product placement and a variety of price <lb/>discounting tools. 4 Numerous studies document the influence of <lb/>point-of-purchase tobacco marketing and price promotions on <lb/>smoking initiation, movement along the smoking continuum to <lb/>a regular smoker and undermining of quit efforts. 3 4 <lb/>In 2006, point-of-sale advertising led traditional tobacco <lb/>advertising expenditures among cigarette and smokeless tobacco <lb/>companies at approximately $243 million for cigarette compa-<lb/>nies and $21 million for smokeless tobacco companies. 27 28 <lb/>However, price-related marketing strategies dominated <lb/>marketing expenditures of both cigarette and tobacco companies <lb/>in 2006. 27 28 Price promotions are frequently linked to contrac-<lb/>tual agreements between the tobacco companies and retailers to <lb/>offer volume discounts and financial incentives to secure product <lb/>placement and marketing materials where they will be noticed <lb/>by consumers. 29 <lb/>The trend towards price-related marketing relative to expen-<lb/>ditures for image-oriented cigarette advertising began in the late <lb/>1980s. 25 Following the 1998 MSA which banned tobacco bill-<lb/>board advertising and placed restrictions on other forms of <lb/>traditional advertising and promotions, this trend was acceler-<lb/>ated. 4 25 30 31 In 2006, cigarette companies allocated 93% ($11.5 <lb/>billion) of all their advertising and promotions expenditures <lb/>toward price-related strategies (promotional allowances, <lb/>coupons, retail value added and price discounts) and smokeless <lb/>tobacco companies spent 69% ($246 million) of all their adver-<lb/>tising and promotion expenditures on these categories. 27 28 <lb/>Media and programme interventions to address tobacco <lb/>marketing <lb/>Since 1990, California&apos;s media campaign has raised awareness <lb/>about the tobacco industry&apos;s marketing practices and sought to <lb/>shape attitudes that support placing restrictions on tobacco <lb/>marketing. As illustrated in figure 1, a 1994 outdoor advertise-<lb/>ment called attention to tobacco company sponsorship of <lb/>motorsport events and their appeal to youth. Between 2001 and <lb/>2004 a television advertising campaign featuring Ken Lane, <lb/>a fictional tobacco industry marketing executive, was aired. <lb/>These advertisements, which are available from the Centers for <lb/>Disease Control Media Resource Center, discussed tobacco <lb/>industry marketing, (eg, sponsorship of motorsports, in-store <lb/>advertising and target marketing). 32 Figure 2 displays a print <lb/>advertisement from the Ken Lane campaign, which raised <lb/>awareness about the strategic placement of tobacco advertise-<lb/>ments in stores. More recently, the 2009 Grim Reapers television <lb/>advertisement called attention to the deadly nature of distrib-<lb/>uting free tobacco products. 33 See figure 3. <lb/>In addition to the media campaign, three statewide advocacy <lb/>campaigns mobilised community efforts to address tobacco <lb/>marketing. Each campaign provided training and electronic or <lb/>print toolkits for tobacco control projects, including instruments <lb/>to monitor tobacco marketing, sample policies, talking points <lb/>and educational and public relations materials. 34e43 <lb/>The first campaign, Operation Storefront: Youth Against Tobacco <lb/>Advertising and Promotions began in 1994 (A Roeseler, C Russell, <lb/>E Feighery, et al, unpublished report, 1995). This campaign <lb/>sought to restrict the placement of in-store tobacco advertising <lb/>in locations where it was likely to be seen by youths and to <lb/>stimulate enforcement of existing laws that restrict placement <lb/>of exterior retail advertising. Compliance with these exterior <lb/>signage laws, which were originally enacted for beautification <lb/>(eg, prohibit outdoor sandwich board signs) or public safety <lb/>purposes (eg, limits on the percentage of a store window that <lb/>may be covered by advertising to ensure the store interior is <lb/>visible to police from the outside), reduces tobacco advertising. 44 <lb/>By 2001, approximately 40 California cities and counties had <lb/>enacted ordinances restricting in-store tobacco advertising or <lb/>outdoors in locations frequented by minors. 45 These ordinances <lb/>were nullified as the result of the US Supreme Court Lorillard <lb/>Tobacco Co v Reilly (533 US 525 (2001) decision which struck <lb/>down a Massachusetts regulation prohibiting tobacco product <lb/>advertising within 1000 feet of any school or playground. 4 <lb/>A second CTCP campaign, initiated in 1997 was Project <lb/>SMART (Sponsorship Mission: Avoid Reliance on Tobacco) Money. It <lb/>focused on reducing tobacco industry event sponsorship and free <lb/>tobacco product sampling through policy adoption and <lb/>enforcement of existing sampling laws (TB Cruz, N Preacely, <lb/>unpublished report, 2005). California policies to eliminate <lb/>tobacco-related event sponsorship include 22 state, county and <lb/>local fair board policies, seven rodeo-level policies and 20 <lb/>university, college and community level policies prohibiting <lb/>tobacco sponsorship or advertising. 46e48 <lb/>California state law prohibits tobacco sampling in many <lb/>locales, but permits it in adult-only facilities. 49 As of 2009, there <lb/>were 47 ordinances restricting the free distribution of tobacco <lb/>products in California. 50 One of the strongest of these is the city <lb/>of Chico&apos;s 2007 ban on the non-sale distribution of smokeless <lb/>tobacco and cigarettes, coupons and rebates in locations <lb/>including bars, fraternities, sororities, convenience stores and gas <lb/>stations. 51 This college community has a population of 69 000 <lb/>and a student population of 17 000 at California State Univer-<lb/>sity Chico. Before its ordinance, the US Smokeless Tobacco <lb/>Company (USST) sponsored bar nights in the city, and parties at <lb/>the university&apos;s fraternities and sororities. Students were often <lb/>hired to give away free samples of tobacco products along with <lb/>promotional items, including T-shirts, shot glasses and lighted <lb/>necklaces in exchange for personal information. 52 53 <lb/>The third statewide advocacy effort launched was the STORE <lb/>(Strategic Tobacco Retail Effort) Campaign in 2002. It took <lb/>a comprehensive approach to the retail environment in terms of <lb/>tobacco marketing and sales. 43 This campaign helped build <lb/>momentum for local tobacco retail licensing and self-service <lb/>display bans. From 1998 to September 2009, 102 tobacco retail <lb/>licensing ordinances were enacted which cover about 57% of the <lb/>state&apos;s population. 54 The number of self-service tobacco sales <lb/>bans enacted increased from 27 in 1994 to 157 in July 2009. 54 55 <lb/>The large number of local self-service display ordinances facili-<lb/>tated passage of a statewide self-service display ban on cigarettes <lb/>in 2002, which was expanded to include other tobacco products <lb/>in 2004. 56 57 <lb/>California Attorney General Office collaboration <lb/>The campaigns described above were complemented by aggressive <lb/>enforcement activity by the California Attorney General&apos;s Office. <lb/>The California Attorney General&apos;s Office used documentation <lb/></body>

			<body>provided by state and local tobacco control programmes to <lb/>pursue enforcement and lawsuits against tobacco companies and <lb/>to compel large corporate retailers to enter into voluntary <lb/>agreements to abide by business practices aimed at reducing <lb/>illegal tobacco sales to minors. Since 2000, the California <lb/>Attorney General&apos;s Office efforts resulted in 14 successful <lb/>enforcement actions against tobacco companies totalling more <lb/>than $24 million in payments, penalties and fees. Of these <lb/>payments, nearly $1.9 million was earmarked for tobacco <lb/>control. Eight (57%) of the enforcement actions involved viola-<lb/>tions of the MSA and six (43%) were for violations of California <lb/>state law regulating the non-sale distribution of tobacco prod-<lb/>ucts. RJ Reynolds and USST were responsible for 13 (93%) of <lb/>these enforcement actions. Appendix 1 provides additional <lb/>details. 58e72 <lb/>In 2002 the California Attorney General&apos;s Office negotiated <lb/>with the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing and Philip <lb/>Morris to revise information and materials they distributed to <lb/>retailers to educate them about mandated age-of-sale warning <lb/>sign requirements and to communicate that the use of the We <lb/>Card sign did not comply with State law. 73 In partnership with <lb/>other state attorneys general, it also negotiated voluntary <lb/>agreements with 12 major chain retail convenience, drug store, <lb/>gas station and grocery stores to implement meaningful business <lb/>practices to reduce tobacco sales to minors. An additional <lb/>agreement with a California grocery store chain resulted from <lb/>litigation. 74 <lb/>METHODS <lb/>California&apos;s tobacco industry monitoring system collects data on <lb/>tobacco marketing at public events, in the retail environment <lb/>and from adults and youths through telephone and in-school <lb/>surveys. An abbreviated description of each survey&apos;s method-<lb/>ology is described here with references given to obtain a full <lb/>description. <lb/>Event sponsorship monitoring methods <lb/>From 2001 to 2003, tobacco industry event sponsorship moni-<lb/>toring and analyses were conducted by the University of <lb/>Southern California (USC). Beginning in 2006, Population <lb/>Research System (PRS) took over the data collection with CTCP <lb/>conducting the analyses. No statewide tobacco industry event <lb/>sponsorship data were collected during 2004 and 2005. <lb/>During the 2004 to 2005 transition, the USC data collection <lb/>instrument was revised.

			<body>collection and analysis. Survey instruments from both USC <lb/>and PRS collected data on event information, tobacco <lb/>industry sponsorship, youth activities at the event, the presence <lb/>of adult-only areas and event attendance. The methodology to <lb/>estimate audience size varied slightly between the two surveys. <lb/>Owing to funding limitations, a purposive sampling plan was <lb/>used to select events for observation. Selection criteria were <lb/>based on past history of the event including having a large <lb/>audience, a tobacco-sponsored adult-only area, the free distri-<lb/>bution of tobacco products, presence of a mobile electronic <lb/>scoreboard or previous history of tobacco marketing violations <lb/>at similar event types. Both USC and PRS placed a pre-event <lb/>telephone call to confirm the date, location, ticket information <lb/>and information about tobacco industry sponsorship. <lb/>USC staff and volunteers from CTCP-funded projects <lb/>conducted observations from 2001 to 2003. Beginning in 2006, <lb/>only paid observers were used. For the period 2001e2003, <lb/>observers were provided with written instructions and a video <lb/>training programme on how to complete the forms. Completed <lb/>observation forms, tobacco promotional materials and photo-<lb/>graphs from the event were mailed to USC where the data were <lb/>entered into a database. <lb/>Beginning in 2006, observers were trained by CTCP staff. <lb/>Completed observation forms were scanned and emailed to PRS <lb/>following the event observation. Observations forms, the event <lb/>programme, promotional materials and photographs were also <lb/>electronically scanned and uploaded to a file transfer protocol <lb/>(ftp) site by the data collectors. The California Attorney <lb/>General&apos;s Office was provided access to the ftp site to monitor <lb/>the data for potential MSA violations. <lb/>Retail environment monitoring methods <lb/>The California Tobacco Assessment Study is a longitudinal <lb/>prospective cohort study of California stores that sell tobacco. <lb/>Since 2000, six survey waves were conducted to assess tobacco <lb/>marketing materials in the retail environment. The survey was <lb/>conducted in 2000, annually from 2002 to 2005 and in 2008. The <lb/>baseline study sample was based on a 1997 randomly selected <lb/>sample of California stores that sold cigarettes. Each year, stores <lb/>that were found to be &apos;no longer in business&apos; were replaced with <lb/>new randomly selected stores from the original sampling frame. <lb/>Trained paid observers collected data on the amount, placement <lb/>and type of branded cigarette marketing materials, and func-<lb/>tional items (eg, trash cans and coin trays); placement of <lb/>advertisements; posting of tobacco age-of-sale warning signs and <lb/>the required tobacco retail licence; and compliance with the ban <lb/>on self-service displays of tobacco. Further information on the <lb/>methods and analyses can be found in a paper by Feighery et al. 75 <lb/>Telephone surveys and in-school survey methods <lb/>Perceptions of and exposure to tobacco marketing are collected <lb/>through telephone and in-school surveys. The California Adult <lb/>Tobacco Survey (1993e2007) is an ongoing monthly random-<lb/>digit-dial telephone survey of approximately 6200 adults <lb/>conducted using computer assisted telephone interviewing by <lb/>the survey research group, Public Health Institute. Data were <lb/>weighted to the 2000 California population using gender, four <lb/>race groups and two age groups. Additional information on the <lb/>methodology is available in a paper by Wayland et al. 76 The <lb/>California Tobacco Survey is a cross-sectional random-digit-dial <lb/>telephone survey conducted approximately every 3 years since <lb/>1990 by the University of California, San Diego, Cancer <lb/>Prevention and Control Center and Westat, Inc to measure <lb/>changes in attitudes and behaviours in the California popula-<lb/>tion. It has a sample size of approximately 30 575 screener <lb/>households. Oversampling of racial/ethnic groups and in-<lb/>language survey methods are used to ensure adequate sample <lb/>sizes within subpopulation groups. Data were weighted to the <lb/>2005 Current Population Survey, California population. Addi-<lb/>tional information on the methodology is available in a paper by <lb/>Al-Delaimy et al. 77 <lb/>The California Student Tobacco Survey (2002e2006) is a <lb/>school-based survey conducted among approximately 17 000 <lb/>students in over 300 middle (grades 6e8) and high schools <lb/>(grades 9e12). The data were weighted to the 2005 population <lb/>of California in-school youth, by gender, grade level and race/ <lb/>ethnicity. Further information about the methods is available in <lb/>a paper by McCarthy et al. 78 <lb/>Limitations <lb/>It is not possible to determine that the changes documented <lb/>among adults, students and tobacco company marketing prac-<lb/>tices are the result of exposure to the media, policy and <lb/>enforcement interventions. This is due to the cross-sectional <lb/>nature of the population survey data and the lack of measures <lb/>that determine the extent of exposure of adults and youths to <lb/>specific tobacco marketing-related media, programme and <lb/>enforcement interventions. However, the triangulation of data <lb/>from multiple sources increases confidence in the individual <lb/>survey results and the conclusions drawn about progress. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Event sponsorship results <lb/>Tobacco event sponsorship was monitored at large public events <lb/>at risk of tobacco sponsorship such as rodeos, motorsports or <lb/>other events with a history of tobacco sponsorship. Tobacco <lb/>company, brand names, youth participation and free tobacco <lb/>product distribution were key variables that were observed. <lb/>Simple description statistics were used to analyse the data. As <lb/>depicted in table 1, from 2001 to 2008, the percentage of <lb/>observed events with tobacco industry sponsorship declined <lb/>from 77.3% to 48.1%. As displayed in table 2, in 2001, the <lb/>percentage of events with smokeless tobacco and cigarette <lb/>company sponsorship collectively were comparable with each <lb/>having a presence at 60% of the events observed. In subsequent <lb/>years, smokeless tobacco dominated event sponsorship. In 2008, <lb/>USST or its brands sponsored 79% of events in comparison to <lb/>Philip Morris/Altria at 21%. <lb/>As displayed in table 3, rodeo-related events represented <lb/>approximately one-half or more of the total number of tobacco <lb/>industry-sponsored events each year. During 2007 and 2008, the <lb/>percentage of tobacco industry-sponsored music or performing <lb/>art events increased from previous years and is now on par with <lb/>racing, a more traditional tobacco venue. <lb/>The non-sale distribution of tobacco products (eg, free tobacco <lb/>samples and coupons for tobacco products) and youth involve-<lb/>ment activities are sometimes found at tobacco industry-spon-<lb/>sored events. As depicted in table 4, during the six observation <lb/>periods the proportion of events with youth participation <lb/>generally declined; however, more than one-third (36.8%) of <lb/>Table 1 Percentage of observed events with tobacco industry <lb/>sponsorship, 2001e2003 and 2006e2008 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>n[88 <lb/>n[80 <lb/>n[91 <lb/>n[68 <lb/>n[80 <lb/>n[79 <lb/>77.3 <lb/>77.2 <lb/>67.0 <lb/>58.8 <lb/>56.3 <lb/>48.1 <lb/></body>

			<body>tobacco industry-sponsored events still included youth partici-<lb/>pation either as competitors in races, riding or mutton-busting <lb/>events, or they carried flags or banners at event ceremonies, <lb/>demonstrating the long-term strategic nature of tobacco spon-<lb/>sorship in 2008. Overall, there was no real decline in the <lb/>proportion of tobacco industry-sponsored events that offered <lb/>free tobacco product sampling with the proportion ranging from <lb/>a low of 11.5% of events in 2003 rising to 24.4% in 2006 and <lb/>then declining to 18.4% in 2008. <lb/>Tobacco retail advertising results <lb/>Tobacco advertising in the retail environment has been moni-<lb/>tored since 2000. From these surveys, key variables related to the <lb/>saturation of retail tobacco advertising, its placement and <lb/>compliance with state laws are presented. Table 5 presents the <lb/>change in the average number of cigarette marketing materials <lb/>per store for 2000, 2004 and 2008. It rose in 2004, but remained <lb/>constant throughout the observation period. <lb/>Table 6 depicts the change in the percentage of stores with at <lb/>least one cigarette advertisement promoting a price discount and <lb/>the percentage of stores placing cigarette advertisements within <lb/>six inches of candy and placed at or below three feet. The <lb/>placement of advertisements near candy and placement of <lb/>advertisements under three feet declined from 2002 to 2008; <lb/>however, the percentage of stores with at least one advertise-<lb/>ment promoting a price discount increased. <lb/>Between 2000 and 2004, there was a large increase in the <lb/>proportion of stores that had a least one required warning sign <lb/>posted, rising from 53.6% (95% CI 49.0% to 57.3%) in 2000 to <lb/>66.2% (95% CI 62.2% to 70.2%) in 2008. However, as depicted <lb/>by table 7, in 2008 a greater proportion of stores posted the <lb/>tobacco industry-produced We Card sign rather than the age-of-<lb/>sale warning sign required by California law. In contrast, more <lb/>than 99% of stores complied with the state law banning self-<lb/>service displays of tobacco products in 2008. <lb/>Adult and youth attitudes and exposure results <lb/>Attitudes, beliefs and exposure to tobacco marketing are tracked <lb/>through adult telephone surveys and in-school surveys. Key data <lb/>are presented that relate to support for regulating tobacco <lb/>marketing and exposure to tobacco sponsorship. <lb/>In 2007, California adults expressed strong support for regu-<lb/>lating tobacco marketing: 76.4% (95% CI 74.4% to 78.4%) <lb/>agreed that tobacco products should be regulated as a drug by <lb/>a government agency such as the Food and Drug Administration <lb/>(FDA); 75.0% (95% CI 73.9% to 76.0%) agreed that a ban on <lb/>cigarette advertising should be extended to all print and elec-<lb/>tronic media; and 78.2% (95% CI 77.2% to 79.3%) agreed that <lb/>advertising tobacco products at sports and athletic events should <lb/>be banned. 79 Seeing tobacco advertisements at sporting and <lb/>community events and reported attendance at a tobacco <lb/>company-sponsored event in the past year declined among <lb/>youths and adults compared to earlier years. The proportion of <lb/>high school students reporting they had seen tobacco adver-<lb/>tisements at sport or community events declined significantly <lb/>from 58.1% to 52% (p value &lt;0.001) between 2002 and 2006. 80 <lb/>The proportion of adults who reported attending a tobacco <lb/>company-sponsored event in the past year also declined signifi-<lb/>cantly from 19% in 2002 to 14.0% in 2005 (p value &lt;0.001). 81 <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Since the mid-1990s, the CTCP has raised awareness about the <lb/>influence that tobacco marketing has on tobacco use. Its media <lb/>campaign, statewide advocacy campaigns and the partnership <lb/>with the California Attorney General&apos;s Office sought to curb <lb/>tobacco marketing through a variety of voluntary, legislated and <lb/>enforcement approaches. <lb/>Since 2000, there was little change in the overall average <lb/>number of cigarette marketing materials per store but there was <lb/>a substantial increase in the percentage of stores with adver-<lb/>tising promoting price discounts for cigarettes. Progress was <lb/>made in decreasing the percentage of stores placing tobacco <lb/>advertisements near candy displays (reduced to 1% of stores) <lb/>and at the eye-level of young children (reduced from 78.6% to <lb/>31.0%). Compliance with posting required age-of-sale warning <lb/>signs increased significantly, but remained substantially lower <lb/>than posting of the tobacco industry&apos;s We Card sign (66.2% vs <lb/>94.0%). <lb/>Table 2 Percentage of tobacco industry sponsored events by tobacco <lb/>company*, 2001e2003 and 2006e2008 <lb/>Tobacco company <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>n[68 <lb/>n[58 <lb/>n[61 <lb/>n[40 <lb/>n[45 <lb/>n[38 <lb/>USST <lb/>60.3 <lb/>77.6 <lb/>77.0 <lb/>95.0 <lb/>84.4 <lb/>78.9 <lb/>Philip Morris/Altria <lb/>19.1 <lb/>20.7 <lb/>11.5 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>15.6 <lb/>21.1 <lb/>RJ Reynolds <lb/>25.0 <lb/>6.9 <lb/>13.1 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>2.2 <lb/>0 <lb/>Lorillard <lb/>16.2 <lb/>5.2 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>Swedish Match <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>*A single event may have been sponsored by multiple tobacco companies or brands.

			<body>The continued saturation of stores with cigarette advertising <lb/>and increase in price promotion advertisements mirrors the <lb/>emphasis seen in tobacco company expenditures for point-of-<lb/>sale retail advertising and price-related marketing. The high rate <lb/>of retailers posting We Card signs is probably a function of <lb/>contract requirements between tobacco companies and stores. <lb/>These contracts require specific marketing provisions in return <lb/>for price promotions aimed to stimulate sales. 29 This situation <lb/>may improve as local tobacco retail licensing ordinances <lb/>earmarking a portion of the licence fees for enforcement are <lb/>enacted, but a straightforward solution would be for tobacco <lb/>companies to incorporate mandated age-of-sale signage require-<lb/>ments into their price promotion contracts. <lb/>Overall there was a decline in the number and percentage of <lb/>tobacco-sponsored events between 2001 and 2008. This is <lb/>consistent with the significant decline noted among high school <lb/>students and adults who reported seeing tobacco advertisements <lb/>at events or attending a tobacco company-sponsored event. <lb/>There was a marked shift towards smokeless tobacco-related <lb/>sponsorships and rodeo-related event sponsorship, which may <lb/>reflect an industry-wide move to add smokeless tobacco prod-<lb/>ucts to their promoted brands. <lb/>The pervasiveness of free tobacco product sampling at events <lb/>remained relatively unchanged over the six observation periods. <lb/>A modest decline in youth participation-oriented activities at <lb/>tobacco-sponsored events was observed, but more than one-<lb/>third (36.8%) of them continued to include these activities. <lb/>Repeated enforcement action was taken against RJ Reynolds and <lb/>USST to address compliance with the MSA/STMSA and the <lb/>state restriction on no-cost tobacco distribution. This suggests <lb/>that partial bans on tobacco marketing provide greater opport-<lb/>unity to test limits or may be difficult to understand. <lb/>Tobacco industry monitoring data were used to develop media <lb/>and policy interventions such as the Ken Lane and Grim Reapers <lb/>advertisements and statewide advocacy campaigns. The data <lb/>also helped to forge a partnership with the California Attorneys <lb/>General&apos;s Office. Consequently, substantial enforcement opera-<lb/>tions and voluntary agreements were achieved. These resulted in <lb/>new resources for tobacco control work including regular <lb/>correspondence from the tobacco companies about the date and <lb/>location of free tobacco sampling activities and earmarking <lb/>a portion of payments resulting from enforcement action <lb/>towards tobacco control efforts. <lb/>Local tobacco control ordinances restricting tobacco <lb/>marketing before the 2001 US-Supreme Court decision Lorillard <lb/>v Reilly along with the current level of public support for <lb/>tobacco marketing restrictions suggests that California <lb/>communities are well-positioned to seize opportunities afforded <lb/>by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. <lb/>This federal legislation implements a number of new marketing <lb/>restrictions and gives the US Food and Drug Administration <lb/>(FDA) comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, <lb/>marketing and sale of tobacco product. It also eliminates the pre-<lb/>existing federal pre-emption of the state and local restrictions on <lb/>the time, place or manner of cigarette advertising for public <lb/>health purposes. 82 <lb/>Despite these new opportunities, numerous challenges <lb/>remain. Monitoring tobacco industry marketing is difficult <lb/>owing to its sheer volume, diversity and pervasiveness. 1 4 The <lb/>task has become increasingly formidable given the industry&apos;s <lb/>agile response to US restrictions on the use of television, radio, <lb/>billboard, sponsorship and magazine advertisement placement <lb/>and use of technology. Data collection at tobacco industry-<lb/>sponsored bar nights, fraternity parties and adult-only facilities <lb/>relies on labour-intensive methods vastly different from <lb/>surveillance systems traditionally used to monitor communi-<lb/>cable diseases or to track cancer. Monitoring the nature and <lb/>extent of direct mail marketing is difficult, as tobacco industry <lb/>practices incorporate the use of sophisticated technology to <lb/>create one-on-one relationships with consumers through the use <lb/>of contests, the internet, coupons, direct mail, email and mobile <lb/>marketing. 83 84 The First Amendment and tobacco industry <lb/>opposition will continue to create hurdles to the enactment of <lb/>comprehensive bans on tobacco marketing. Yet, there is <lb/>considerable evidence that restrictions to curb the impact of <lb/>tobacco marketing are most effective at reducing tobacco <lb/>consumption when they are comprehensive. 85e88 <lb/>Given these challenges, a network among state and federal <lb/>agencies including attorneys general is needed to coordinate <lb/>efforts and resources to uniformly monitor tobacco industry <lb/>marketing, improve state-specific marketing reporting by <lb/>tobacco companies, leverage legal technical assistance resources, <lb/>coordinate enforcement actions to achieve a greater deterrent <lb/>effect and disseminate educational and media materials to raise <lb/>awareness and facilitate policy adoption. 1 The FDA legislation <lb/>provides a tool to start this work, but success depends on how <lb/>well local, state and national partners can execute meaningful <lb/>policies and their agility at identifying and effectively <lb/>responding to the tobacco industry&apos;s response to use of non-<lb/>restricted media and new marketing techniques. The convening <lb/>and investment of public health, surveillance, legal and <lb/>marketing experts to facilitate this complex, but important <lb/>work should be a high priority among state and federal agencies. <lb/>Table 6 2002e2008: percentage of stores with at least one cigarette advertisement promoting a price <lb/>discount and placement of advertising in a location that may appeal to youths <lb/>Saturation or placement <lb/>2002* <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>2004 <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>2008 <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>(n[569) <lb/>(n[565) <lb/>(n[545) <lb/>At least one cigarette advertisement <lb/>with a price discount <lb/>68.4 <lb/>(64.5 to 72.2) 74.3 <lb/>(70.7 to 78.0) 78.5 <lb/>(75.0 to 82.0) <lb/>Advertisements near candy <lb/>12.5 <lb/>(9.8 to 15.2) <lb/>12.9 <lb/>(10.1 to 15.7) <lb/>1.1 <lb/>(0.2 to 1.9) <lb/>Advertisements at or below 3 feet <lb/>78.6 <lb/>(75.2 to 82.0) 77.9 <lb/>(74.5 to 81.3) 31.0 <lb/>(27.1 to 34.9) <lb/>*2002 data are use for comparison because the 2000 data for advertisements near candy and at or below 3 feet were not comparable <lb/>with subsequent years. <lb/>Table 7 2008 Percentage of tobacco stores posting tobacco sale <lb/>signage <lb/>Year legal <lb/>requirement enacted <lb/>Percentage <lb/>(95% CI) <lb/>(n[) <lb/>State tobacco retail licence 2003 <lb/>45.3 (536) <lb/>(41.0 to 50.0) <lb/>Age-of-sale warning sign <lb/>1994 <lb/>66.2 (545) <lb/>(62.2 to 70.2) <lb/>Tobacco industry <lb/>We Card sign <lb/>Not required by law <lb/>93.8 (545) <lb/>(91.8 to 95.8) <lb/></body>
