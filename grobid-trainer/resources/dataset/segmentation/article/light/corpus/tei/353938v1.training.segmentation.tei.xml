			<front>1 <lb/>Priming of leaf litter decomposition by algae seems of minor importance in <lb/>natural streams during autumn <lb/>Arturo Elosegi 1 , Angie Nicolás 2 and John S.

So far, <lb/>most evidence of this &quot;priming&quot; effect is derived from laboratory or mesocosm <lb/>experiments, and it is unclear what its importance is under natural conditions. We <lb/>measured accrual of algae, phosphorus uptake capacity, and decomposition of <lb/>poplar leaves in autumn in open-and closed-canopy reaches in 3 forest and 3 <lb/>agricultural streams. Chlorophyll a abundance did not change significantly neither <lb/>with stream type nor with canopy cover, although some between open and closed <lb/>reaches, although in some agricultural streams it was higher in open than in closed <lb/>canopy reaches. Canopy cover did not affect either phosphate uptake capacity or <lb/>microbial decomposition.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Organic detritus from terrestrial origin, and leaf litter in particular, is one of <lb/>the main energy sources for food webs in forested headwater streams (Fisher &amp; <lb/>Likens, 1973; Gessner et al., 2010), where riparian shading limits primary <lb/>production (Hill, Ryon &amp; Schilling, 1995). This detritus tends to be dominated by <lb/>recalcitrant compounds such as lignin and cellulose, is stoichiometrically <lb/>imbalanced for the needs of consumers (Anderson, 1976; Hanson et al., 1985; <lb/>Lemoine, Giery &amp; Burkepile, 2014; Evans-white &amp; Halvorson, 2017), and thus, has <lb/>low nutritional value (Brett et al., 2017). Once in the water, leaf litter is colonised <lb/>and &quot;conditioned&quot; by microbes, especially bacteria and aquatic hyphomycetes <lb/>(Krauss et al., 2011), whose lower C:N ratio enhances its overall palatability and <lb/>nutritional value for invertebrate shredders (Hieber &amp; Gessner, 2002; Findlay, <lb/>2010), which thus choose the most nutritious leaf patches (Fuller, Evans-White &amp; <lb/>Entrekin, 2015). <lb/>Yet, the lack of components such as essential fatty acids can still limit the <lb/>nutritional value of leaves even after microbial conditioning (Torres-Ruiz &amp; Wehr, <lb/>2010; Guo et al., 2017). Recently, Lovatt et al. (2014) reported that leaf-litter <lb/>leachate and light interact to promote algal biofilm accrual, which can in turn <lb/>enhance the nutritional quality of leaf litter and thus promote the consumption by <lb/>detritivore invertebrates (Guo et al., 2016). This is an example of the priming effect, <lb/>i.e., the enhancement of decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter by addition <lb/>of labile carbon, which has been extensively documented in terrestrial ecosystems <lb/>(Kuzyakov, 2010), much less frequently in aquatic ecosystems (Guenet et al., 2010; <lb/>Kuehn et al., 2014). In the case of freshwater ecosystems, priming can involve the <lb/>transfer of algal-produced C to heterotrophs (Kuehn et al., 2014), or the direct <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>consumption of algae by detritivore invertebrates (Ledger &amp; Winterbourn, 2000; <lb/>Franken et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2016), which would thus grow faster and have a <lb/>larger effect on litter breakdown. It has even been suggested that consumers <lb/>would preferentially use low-quality terrestrial carbon sources (e.g. leaf litter) for <lb/>respiration, whereas they would preferentially use algae for secondary production <lb/>(Karlsson, 2007). <lb/>Therefore, the priming effect could have important consequences for food <lb/>webs, as well as for the management of stream ecosystems. Yet, most of the <lb/>evidence on the priming effect is derived from experiments either in the laboratory <lb/>or in artificial channels. For instance, Danger et al. (2013) in a factorial mesocosm <lb/>experiment with light and nutrients, showed that under low nutrient <lb/>concentrations diatom growth enhanced litter decomposition. The importance of <lb/>the priming effect under field conditions is currently unclear. In theory, priming <lb/>should be most important in periods of stable baseflow and high light-availability, <lb/>which promote the accrual of algal biomass (Biggs, 1995). However, it is possible <lb/>that priming could be less important in high-flow periods, in strongly shaded <lb/>reaches or in periods of large accumulations of detritus, as heterotrophic microbes <lb/>have been shown to outcompete algae for limiting nutrients (Mindl et al., 2005; <lb/>Danger, Benest &amp; Lacroix, 2007). In particular, in many temperate streams the bulk <lb/>of leaf fall occurs in autumn (Abelho, 2001), a period in which the differences in <lb/>light availability between open and closed reaches decrease as a consequence of <lb/>leaf fall and shorter daylight period, which might reduce the real effect of priming. <lb/>Also, it has been suggested that the priming effect is more important in nutrient-<lb/>poor conditions, where algae would release more labile C exudates (Guenet et al., <lb/>2010), but there is so far little empirical evidence of this. <lb/></body>

			<body>The objective of the present study was to test the importance of priming in <lb/>natural streams during the peak of litterfall. More specifically, we assessed the <lb/>effects of autumnal riparian cover on biofilm accrual and activity, and on litter <lb/>decomposition in streams of contrasting nutrient status. Our hypotheses were: i) <lb/>that biofilm accrual will be higher at open than at closed reaches, ii) that higher <lb/>biofilm accrual will boost litter breakdown at nutrient-poor but not at nutrient-<lb/>rich streams, and iii) that the effect will be higher for invertebrate fragmentation <lb/>than for microbial decomposition. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study sites <lb/>The experiment was performed in six streams, 3 forested (F1 to F3) and 3 <lb/>agricultural (A1 to A3), near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (Table 1). The <lb/>forest streams are located in the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest (Maple Ridge, <lb/>BC), a 52 km 2 area owned by the University of British Columbia. It is almost <lb/>entirely covered by forest, dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), <lb/>western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata), and <lb/>with red alder (Alnus rubra) and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) abundant <lb/>in the riparian areas. The lithology is granitic, soils acidic and streams in the area <lb/>have extremely low conductivity and nutrient concentrations. The agricultural <lb/>streams are located ca. 30 km further south, in the Fraser River Delta (Surrey and <lb/>Aldergrove, BC), a region with intense agricultural activities, including berry farms <lb/>and dairies, and scattered urban areas. The same tree species occur, but the forest <lb/>cover is much lower than in the forest streams, grasses and bushes becoming more <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>important. Lithology is dominated by glacial till, streams are circumneutral and <lb/>richer in nutrients (Shupe, 2017). <lb/>The climate in the Vancouver region is moderate oceanic, with an annual <lb/>mean temperature near 11 °C and a precipitation ranging from 1500 mm per year <lb/>in the coast to over 3000 mm in the mountains. Summers are drier, and autumn <lb/>tends to be very rainy. <lb/>In each stream we selected two nearby (less than 200 m apart) riffle reaches, <lb/>one with open canopy (O), and the other with closed canopy (C). <lb/>Biofilm <lb/>To measure biofilm accrual and activity we used biofilm carriers. These are <lb/>standard materials where biofilm can attach, designed to promote self-purification <lb/>in aquaria by encouraging growth of bacteria inside the water pump. We used Bio-<lb/>filter balls (Marineland, United Pet Group, Spectrum Brand Inc., Blacksburg, VA), <lb/>which consist of hollow plastic spheres, 2 cm in diameter, with a surface made of <lb/>thin plates, the space between plates allowing water flow as to promote biofilm <lb/>growth. Two such balls were tied with fishing line to each of the rebars used to <lb/>deploy litterbags (see below), at mid depth. They were recovered together with the <lb/>litterbags, enclosed by pairs in 50 mL Falcon tubes with filtered stream water, and <lb/>carried to the laboratory in an ice chest to perform a phosphate-uptake bioassay. <lb/>Once in the laboratory, the stream water was replaced by an acclimation <lb/>solution (1 L of Perrier water in 4 L of distilled water), designed to ensure a <lb/>sufficient supply of micronutrients, and the Falcons were incubated for 30 min in a <lb/>LabRoller rotator at minimum speed inside a Cenviron environmental chamber at <lb/>8 °C temperature and 50 µmol of PAR (Apogee quantum sensor SQ100). After this <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>acclimation period, the water in the Falcons was replaced by a 5 µM solution of <lb/>PO 4 3-, prepared by dissolving H 2 NaO 4 P . H 2 O in the acclimation solution, and were <lb/>incubated for 1 h. An additional set of five pairs of uncolonized biofilm carriers was <lb/>used as blanks. After this period, water was filtered from the Falcons (Whatman <lb/>GF/F) and frozen to later analyse the remaining P concentration (see below), and <lb/>the biofilm carriers were frozen in the Falcons. The uptake rate of phosphorus (Up, <lb/>in mg P h -1 ) was calculated as: <lb/>U p  V <lb/>C b  C c <lb/>T <lb/>where V is the volume of incubation solution (L), C b is the final concentration of P <lb/>(mg P L -1 ) in the bank treatment (uncolonized biofilm carriers), C c is the final P <lb/>concentration in the colonized treatment and T is the incubation time (h). <lb/>Biofilm carriers were later thawed, kept by pairs in 20 mL of acetone <lb/>overnight at 4 °C, and their content of chlorophyll was measured fluorometrically <lb/>(TD-700, Turner Designs), using uncolonized biofilm carriers in acetone as a blank. <lb/>Leaf breakdown <lb/>We studied the breakdown of black cottonwood leaves, a common riparian <lb/>tree in the area with relatively poor-quality leaves (Crutsinger et al., 2014), which, <lb/>thus, could be more prone to priming. Recently fallen leaves were collected below <lb/>five adjacent trees in Burnaby (BC, Canada), taken to the laboratory and air-dried. <lb/>Batches of 3.0 (±0.1) g of dry leaves were enclosed in coarse (9 mm) or fine (250 <lb/>µm) mesh bags. One fine bag was enclosed inside each coarse bag, thus ensuring <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>that they were subject to the same environmental conditions. Bags were taken to <lb/>the field and tied with cable binders simultaneously to the biofilm carriers, to five <lb/>metal rebars per reach (1 double bag per rebar), anchored in riffle sections. Bags <lb/>were retrieved after 2 months of incubation, enclosed in zip-lock bags and carried <lb/>to the laboratory in an ice chest. There, they were opened, the remaining leaf <lb/>material was cleaned with tap water on a 250-µm sieve, and the ash-free dry mass <lb/>(AFDM) was measured gravimetrically after drying (60 °C, 96 h) and ashing <lb/>(500 °C, 4 h). The initial ash-free dry mass was calculated from 10 additional <lb/>batches of dry leaves, which were dried and ashed as explained. Breakdown rates <lb/>were calculated according to the negative exponential model (Petersen &amp; Cummins, <lb/>1974) with time in degree-days. Following Lecerf (2017) we calculated the mean <lb/>litter fragmentation rate (λ F ) as <lb/> F  k c  <lb/>k f  k c <lb/>ln(k f )  ln(k c ) <lb/>where λ F is the mean fragmentation rate and k c and k f the breakdown rates <lb/>in coarse and fine mesh bags, respectively. <lb/>Environmental variables <lb/>On 5 occasions during the decomposition experiment, we measured wetted <lb/>cross-section with a ruler and a measuring tape, and water velocity (current meter <lb/>Swoffer 2100) to calculate stream discharge. Additionally, we measured water <lb/>temperature, conductivity and pH (field probe YSI Pro1030) and dissolved oxygen <lb/>(field probe YSI ProODO), and collected water samples, which were filtered <lb/>(Whatman GF/F), carried to the laboratory in an ice chest, and frozen immediately <lb/>for analysis of nutrients. The concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and <lb/></body>

Riparian cover was <lb/>estimated from zenithal photos taken with a 28 mm (35 mm equivalent) lens <lb/>(camera Fujifilm X20), which were later processed to maximize contrast and then <lb/>analysed with ImageJ, a free software downloadable from <lb/>https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ to measure total image brightness, which was converted <lb/>into cover. <lb/>Statistical analyses <lb/>We used linear mixed effect models to contrast stream water characteristics <lb/>(IBM SPSS V.24) with stream type (agricultural vs forested) and canopy cover <lb/>(open vs closed) as fixed factors, and stream identity as random effect with five <lb/>levels. Nutrient variables (PO 4 -P and TIN) were log transformed to meet normality <lb/>assumptions. Significance for each term was assessed by model comparisons using <lb/>likelihood ratio test (Crawley, 2007). <lb/>Results <lb/>The experiment started in late September 2017, after an unusual dry summer <lb/>that caused extremely low baseflows in the streams in the area. The weather <lb/>suddenly changed after the 16 th of October, when large storms affected the area for <lb/> 5 days (http://climate.weather.gc.ca/). Floods scoured all bags and most of the <lb/></body>

			<body>biofilm carriers deployed in Blaney Creek (stream F1), which led us to remove this <lb/>stream from the study. After these floods, weather remained fairly dry from 26 th <lb/>October to 7 th November, and then it rained almost every day until the end of the <lb/>experiment, although no large floods were registered. <lb/>Riparian cover at the beginning of the experiment ranged from 0 to 45% at <lb/>the open reaches, whereas it was higher than 76% at the closed reaches (Table 2). <lb/>It decreased along the experiment in all reaches, as deciduous trees lost their <lb/>leaves, but the closed reaches still maintained riparian cover higher than 55%. <lb/>Average discharge over the study period ranged from 129 L s -1 in stream A1 to 586 <lb/>Ls -1 in stream A2. The average temperature was higher in agricultural than in <lb/>forest streams (9.2-9.9 vs 7.0-8.5 °C, respectively), as were pH (7.0-7.4 vs 6.4-6.5) <lb/>and conductivity (163-252 vs 19 µScm -1 ). On the contrary, oxygen concentration <lb/>tended to be higher at forest (11.0-11.9 mgL -1 ) than at agricultural (9.3-10.1 mgL -<lb/>1 ) streams (Table 2). Average TIN concentrations were below 0.30 mg N L -1 in <lb/>forest streams, whereas they ranged from 0.47 to 1.81 in agricultural streams. SRP <lb/>concentrations were below 6 µg P L -1 in forest streams, whereas they ranged from <lb/>12.8 to 35.0 in agricultural streams. Linear mixed models detected statistically <lb/>significant difference between agricultural and forest streams for oxygen <lb/>concentration (F 1,4 = 64.6; p=0.001), pH (F 1,4 = 58.5; p=0.002), conductivity (F 1,4 = <lb/>239.2; p&lt;0.001), TIN (F 1,4 = 16.1; p=0.016) and phosphate (F 1,4 = 27.8; p=0.006), <lb/>whereas differences were marginal for temperature (F 1,4 = 5.1; p=0.088). None of <lb/>these variables showed statistically significant differences between open and <lb/>closed reaches. <lb/>Chlorophyll a per pair of biofilm carriers ranged from 0.83±0.43 µg <lb/>(mean±SD) in F2 to 10.53±7.99 in A1 (Fig. 1). Differences were not significant <lb/></body>

			<body>between stream types (LMM, F 1,3 = 2.4; p=0.216) nor between open and closed <lb/>reaches (F 1,3 = 3.5; p=0.154), and the interaction canopy*type was neither <lb/>significant (F 1,3 = 2.12; p=0.239). Nevertheless, there were statistically significant <lb/>differences of the stream factor (F 3,3 = 13.5; p=0.030) as well as for the <lb/>canopy*stream interaction (F 3,37 = 3.2; p=0.035), showing that the canopy effect <lb/>was significant at some streams. In these cases, open reaches had more chlorophyll <lb/>than closed ones. <lb/>Phosphate uptake in the bioassay performed with biofilm carriers ranged <lb/>from 0.96±0.28 µg P h -1 in reach F2C to 1.52±0.37 in reach F3C (Fig. 2). The uptake <lb/>per unit of chlorophyll ranged from 32.2±12.4 to 1582±382 µg P mg Chl -1 h -1 (Fig. <lb/>2). It was lowest in streams A1 and A2, the two ones with highest basal <lb/>concentrations of SRP in water. None of the factors and interactions tested by LMM <lb/>resulted statistically significant for phosphate uptake (p&gt;0.05 in all cases), but <lb/>there were significant differences in uptake per unit of chlorophyll for the factor <lb/>stream (F 3,3 = 10.3; p=0.044) and the interaction canopy*stream (F 3,37 = 4.0; <lb/>p=0.014). <lb/>After 2 months of incubation, the leaf AFDM remaining in fine mesh bags <lb/>ranged from 18.02±6.26 in reach AO3 to 49.44±2.51% in FC2 (Fig. S1). No clear <lb/>differences could be detected either between agricultural and forest streams, nor <lb/>between closed and open reaches. The leaf AFDM remaining in coarse mesh bags <lb/>ranged from 1.80±1.96 in AO3 to 47.17±2.32 in FO3. It was higher in forest than in <lb/>agricultural streams, but no obvious differences were detected between open and <lb/>closed reaches. The temperature-corrected breakdown rates ranged from <lb/>0.0015±0.0001 to 0.0032±0.0006 dd -1 in fine mesh bags and from 0.0018±0.0003 <lb/>to 0.0082±0.0021 dd -1 in coarse mesh bags. In fine mesh bags there were no <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>obvious differences between agricultural and forest streams, but in coarse mesh <lb/>bags agricultural streams tended to have higher breakdown rates (Fig. 3). No clear <lb/>differences were seen between open and closed reaches. LMM showed the factors <lb/>stream type and canopy cover and their interaction to have no statistically <lb/>significant effect on fine-mesh decomposition rate, but stream had (F 3,3 = 33.8; <lb/>p=0.008). For coarse mesh bags the only statistically significant difference was <lb/>attributed to the canopy*stream interaction (F 3,36 = 3.45; p=0.027), although the <lb/>direction of the difference was not consistent among streams. <lb/>Finally, the fragmentation rate, i.e., the contribution of shredders and <lb/>physical abrasion to total breakdown, ranged from 0.0011 to 0.0259 d -1 , and <lb/>tended to be higher in agricultural than in forest streams (Fig. 4), although <lb/>differences between stream types were not statistically significant. LMM only <lb/>found a statistically significant effect for the interaction between canopy cover and <lb/>stream (F 3,36 = 4.83; p&lt;0.006), thus showing that fragmentation rate was higher in <lb/>open than in closed reaches of some streams. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our results point to a weak priming effect by algae on autumn litter <lb/>decomposition in the study streams. In agricultural streams there was a trend for <lb/>open reaches to have more chlorophyll than closed ones, but the differences were <lb/>not consistent and did not translate into faster litter decomposition. Although <lb/>stream*canopy interactions showed differences between open and closed reaches <lb/>in some streams, the direction of the difference was not consistent among streams. <lb/>Thus, our overall results suggest that other environmental factors override the <lb/>potential effect of algal growth on leaf litter dynamics. <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>Our experimental design, with open and closed reaches very close to each <lb/>other, aimed at reducing the potentially confounding effects of other <lb/>environmental variables apart from canopy cover. Among our forest streams open <lb/>reaches are rare and very short, whereas among our agricultural streams usually <lb/>there is an alternation of short open and closed reaches. Therefore, none of the <lb/>environmental variables measured in addition to canopy cover showed systematic <lb/>differences among reach types, as water quality variables usually respond to <lb/>riparian cover at longer scales, on the order of hundreds to thousands of metres <lb/>(Allan, 2004; Johnson, 2004). On the other hand, the differences in canopy cover <lb/>between open and closed reaches decreased but did not disappear over the study <lb/>period, and therefore, the changes found among reach types can be attributed to <lb/>canopy cover. <lb/>Under these conditions, algal biomass showed no response to canopy cover <lb/>in the forest streams, thus suggesting algal growth there to be limited by factors <lb/>other than light, probably nutrients. The concentration of phosphorus in our forest <lb/>streams was close, when not below, detection limits. Additionally, high N:P atomic <lb/>ratio ranged from 52 (A1C ) to 164 (F3C), suggesting P to be the limiting nutrient <lb/>in all our sites (Elser et al., 2000; Sterner et al., 2008). As the winter approaches, <lb/>other factors such as low water temperature, decreased day length, low elevation <lb/>of the sun in the horizon, frequent cloudy days and high flow tend to limit algal <lb/>growth (Izagirre &amp; Elosegi, 2005), which probably explains the lack of differences <lb/>in our forest, nutrient-limited streams. Long baseflow periods promote biofilm <lb/>accrual (Ponsatí et al., 2015), whereas floods scour algae (Francoeur &amp; Biggs, <lb/>2006), and thus, in mountain streams frequent floods can override the effects of <lb/>canopy cover on algal biomass (Boulêtreau et al., 2008). It is likely that, even if <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>there were no differences in chlorophyll content, the algal assemblages differed <lb/>between open and closed reaches, as algal taxa differ in their competitive abilities <lb/>depending on light and nutrient availability (Franken et al., 2005; Litchman &amp; <lb/>Klausmeier, 2008; Lange, Townsend &amp; Matthaei, 2016). However, even if this was <lb/>the case, overall it had no measurable effect on our decomposition rates. <lb/>Contrary to our expectations, phosphate uptake capacity, a proxy for biofilm <lb/>activity, did not differ between forest and agricultural streams, or between open <lb/>and closed reaches. In general, the metabolic activity of stream biofilm depends on <lb/>its biomass (Haggerty et al., 2014), whereas the uptake per unit biomass tends to <lb/>be greatest at oligotrophic, nutrient-poor reaches (Mulholland, 1996). <lb/>Nevertheless, internal phosphorus recycling at the biofilm level gains importance <lb/>in nutrient-rich reaches (Mulholland et al., 1995), which usually reduces uptake <lb/>rate (Proia, Romaní &amp; Sabater, 2017) and results in our bioassay yielding highest <lb/>uptake rate in moderately enriched streams (Arturo Elosegi, unpublished data). <lb/>The small differences we found in P uptake rate per unit of chlorophyll suggest a <lb/>part of the algal biomass to be not very active, probably as a consequence of the <lb/>senescence of algal mats by the end of autumn, which reduces the biological <lb/>activity even if the biomass is large (Izagirre et al., 2008). Interestingly, the weak <lb/>trends found between open and closed reaches point towards a higher nutrient <lb/>uptake per unit biomass in the latter, which again, was contrary to our <lb/>expectations, and could be related to site-specific characteristics such as flow <lb/>velocity. <lb/>Microbial decomposition, as measured by temperature-corrected breakdown <lb/>rate in fine-mesh bags, did not differ between agricultural and forest streams, or <lb/>between open and closed reaches, although the random factor stream was <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>statistically significant. This is a surprising result, as moderate nutrient <lb/>concentrations as those found in our agricultural streams have been shown to <lb/>promote litter breakdown (Gulis, Ferreira &amp; Graca, 2006), although effects are <lb/>much more clear for total decomposition (Chauvet et al., 2016). For coarse mesh <lb/>bags, although there seemed to be a trend for litter to decompose faster at <lb/>agricultural streams, the differences in temperature-corrected breakdown rates <lb/>were again not statistically significant, contrasting with clear patterns shown <lb/>elsewhere (Woodward et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the statistically significant <lb/>interaction between canopy cover and stream suggested a weak priming effect in <lb/>some of the streams. We can only speculate about the reasons for this difference <lb/>occurring only in some streams, but it is likely that local factors affected differently <lb/>the two reaches studied in one stream, thus overriding the weak effects of priming. <lb/>Indeed, litter breakdown is sensitive to small differences in flow velocity (Dewson, <lb/>James &amp; Death, 2007), sediment deposition (Piggott et al., 2012) or biological <lb/>communities (Handa et al., 2014), factors that can change at the micro-habitat <lb/>scale (Elosegi, Flores &amp; Díez, 2011). In our case, shredders were present in all sites <lb/>(Arturo Elosegi, personal observation), including agricultural streams. Intense <lb/>human activities can result in local extinction of large shredders such as <lb/>crustacean gammarids, and thus impact litter breakdown (Hladyz et al., 2011), but <lb/>our streams seem not to have crossed this impairment threshold. <lb/>The trend towards higher fragmentation rates suggests that invertebrates <lb/>were even more important in our agricultural than in our forest streams, which is <lb/>usually not the case (Hladyz et al., 2011). Again, the interaction between stream <lb/>and canopy cover was statistically significant, suggesting that the priming effect <lb/>can be important at least in some streams. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>Overall, our results suggest that algal priming of litter decomposition, a key <lb/>ecosystem process (Hagen et al., 2012), is at best weak in natural streams during <lb/>autumn, when the environmental conditions become less favourable for algal <lb/>growth. The relevance of priming in streams remains a controversial effect. <lb/>Although the nutritional quality of biofilms tends to be greater when algae are <lb/>present (Huggins, Frenette &amp; Arts, 2004) and much of the nitrogen assimilated by <lb/>stream consumers is of algal origin (Brett et al., 2017), the effects on litter <lb/>decomposition are often unclear. Most of the research has been performed in the <lb/>laboratory or in artificial streams, and even there results are far from unequivocal. <lb/>For instance, a recent laboratory experiment (Guo et al., 2016) found enhanced <lb/>nutrients but not light to promote shredder biomass and breakdown rate, <lb/>contrasting with other experiments (Franken et al., 2005), who found no effect on <lb/>shredder-mediated decomposition, although light promoted the growth of Asellus <lb/>and Gammarus crustaceans. (Guo et al., 2016) attributed the lack of effect to the <lb/>small difference between their two light levels (21 and 114 µmol m -2 s -1 ). We did <lb/>not measure differences in light levels between our open and closed reaches, but it <lb/>is likely that they were rather small and decreased during the experiment, as a <lb/>consequence of leaf fall, shortening of the day and increased cloudiness. As for field <lb/>experiments, although some authors (Kuehn et al., 2014) found exposure to light <lb/>to stimulate decomposition in the field, their &quot;shadow&quot; treatment was artificial, as <lb/>they covered the channel with cloth. Similarly, Vonk et al. (2016) found that, <lb/>whereas in microcosms, invertebrates showed a preference for artificial substrate <lb/>with poly-unsaturated fatty acids added, this effect could not be detected in the <lb/>field, probably because it was overruled by unknown sources of variation. Priming <lb/>could be more important in summer, when the differences in light availability <lb/></body>
