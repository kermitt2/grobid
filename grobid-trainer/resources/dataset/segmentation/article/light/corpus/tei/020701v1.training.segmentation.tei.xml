			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The anxiety disorders are among the costliest classes of mental disorders, both in morbidity <lb/>and economic cost (DiLuca and Olesen, 2014; Baldwin et al., 2014). Development of <lb/>anxiety-reducing (anxiolytic) drugs has been a major focus of the pharmaceutical industry <lb/>and academic neuropsychiatric research, though no new drug types have been adopted <lb/>since the introduction of selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other <lb/>antidepressants for the treatment of anxiety disorders (Tone, 2009; Griebel and Holmes, <lb/>2013). Anxiety research relies on similarities between human emotional behavior and <lb/>behaviors in animals (Darwin, 1998), specifically rat and mouse (Prut and Belzung, 2003). <lb/>While there are many rodent behavioral paradigms that aim to model anxiety-like behaviors, <lb/>three related assays that specifically aim to measure anxiety-related defense behavior <lb/>(ARDEB) have been established, also referred to as the approach-avoidance conflict tests <lb/>(Griebel and Holmes, 2013). These assays are the elevated plus maze (EPM), the light-dark <lb/>box (LD) and the open field (OF), the first, second and fifth most widely used assays in <lb/>animal anxiety research, respectively (Griebel and Holmes, 2013). All three arena types used <lb/>in these assays contain a sheltered domain (e.g., the closed arms in EPM) and an exposed <lb/>region. It is thought that avoidance of the exposed portions of the chamber reports on <lb/>anxiety-like states in the rodent brain. These assays are generally accepted as preclinical <lb/>assays of anxiety disorders, by reference to classic studies that validated them with a panel <lb/>of drugs known to have anxiety-modulating effects in humans (Crawley and Goodwin, 1980; <lb/>Pellow et al., 1985; Simon et al., 1994). <lb/>Rodent research has been implicated in the largely frustrated efforts to develop new <lb/>types of anxiolytics (Griebel and Holmes, 2013). The literature regarding defense behavior is <lb/>contradictory about the size and even the direction of many interventions that are proposed <lb/>to be anxiolytic or anxiogenic (together &apos;anxiotropic&apos;) (Prut and Belzung, 2003; Griebel and <lb/></body>

            <body>Holmes, 2013). This is true even for some anxiety-related genes with major clinical <lb/>relevance, such as Htt, the target of SSRIs. As with the assessment of clinical anxiety <lb/>interventions (Baldwin et al., 2014), a solid evidence base of the effect of &apos;mainstream&apos; <lb/>anxiety interventions in the rodent ARDEB assays is necessary to guide decisions about <lb/>further basic research and therapeutic development (Vesterinen et al., 2014). In light of the <lb/>widespread discordance, we proposed the hypothesis that some of the purported anxiety-<lb/>related factors had no substantial effect on ARDEB. We will refer to this as the &quot;no-ARDEB-<lb/>effect hypothesis.&quot; Secondary goals of this survey were to examine patterns in ARDEB <lb/>evidence: gaps in the literature, heterogeneity and publication bias <lb/>To estimate the effect sizes of anxiotropic interventions, we first used an ad hoc <lb/>literature search to identify ten claimed anxiety interventions and followed this with <lb/>systematic reviews on all. From the articles identified, systematic or randomly sampled <lb/>meta-analyses were performed, depending on the numbers of eligible articles available. The <lb/>majority of purported anxiety-related interventions showed substantial effects on ARDEB. <lb/>However, three supposed anxiotropic interventions showed only small and/or non-<lb/>statistically significant effects on ARDEB. Our study also indicated that the Htt literature <lb/>appears to be affected by publication bias. <lb/></body>

            <body>METHODS <lb/>Literature review <lb/>Genes, drugs and environmental interventions that had been proposed to be involved in <lb/>anxiety were identified by a literature search of review articles on the field of anxiety. Based <lb/>on the history of anxiety research (Tone, 2009; Griebel and Holmes, 2013), a list of ten <lb/>anxiotropic interventions were selected to be included in the systematic review, either due <lb/>to their direct clinical importance (e.g., diazepam), their role as an example of a class of <lb/>proposed anxiety-related factors (e.g., isolation), or their connection to a clinically important <lb/>drug (e.g., Htt). A systematic review was conducted to identify published articles <lb/>addressing experimental outcomes in rodents from the EPM, OF, or LD assays for these <lb/>interventions. A comprehensive literature set for each genetic, pharmacological or <lb/>environmental intervention was generated by a PubMed search using specific search <lb/>phrases (Table 1). The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) will be the subject of a <lb/>separate study currently in preparation, due to their clinical importance (Baldwin et al., <lb/>2014), the very large number of studies conducted on them (Griebel and Holmes, 2013), <lb/>and their controversial efficacy (Kirsch et al., 2008). <lb/>Eligibility criteria and study selection <lb/>Bibliographic data (including PubMed ID, date of publication, title and abstract) of studies <lb/>identified in the systematic review were exported to a spreadsheet using the PubMed <lb/>export function. Each article on this list was then reviewed at four levels of detail (title, <lb/>abstract, full text and a detailed review of experimental design) to determine their eligibility <lb/>for the review. Studies were required to be written in English and to have reported ARDEB <lb/>in adult rats or mice. We required that each included study contain (1) primary behavior <lb/>data from either an OF, EPM, or LD experiment for the intervention of interest, (2) suitable <lb/>controls were reported and (3) the relevant statistics were reported (mean, standard error or <lb/></body>

            <body>standard deviation, and sample sizes of both control and intervention groups). Since the <lb/>focus of this study was the direct effects of anxiety-related interventions on ARDEB, <lb/>experiments that used combination treatments were excluded. For drug and environmental <lb/>interventions, possible confounding effects of the role of developmental stage were <lb/>reduced by excluding studies not performed in adult rodents. For gene knockout and <lb/>overexpression interventions, only experiments using a lifetime loss of function were <lb/>included in the meta-analyses. <lb/>Selection of non-anxiety-related interventions <lb/>Studies of the effect of non-anxiety-related interventions on ARDEB were harder to find, <lb/>perhaps due to the bias against publishing negative results, and/or reduced likelihood of <lb/>mentioning them in abstracts. PubMed searches in this area failed to identify any useful <lb/>studies. Instead, a conventional ad hoc literature search was used to find reports of the <lb/>effects of adenylyl cyclase 1 (two articles) and synaptotagmin (one article) on anxiety-<lb/>related behaviors. <lb/>Data inclusion in meta-analyses <lb/>Of the ten systematic reviews, eight identified fewer than or equal to fifteen eligible studies <lb/>and two identified more than fifteen (Table 1). For the first group, we used all available data <lb/>in their respective systematic meta-analyses. As our aim was to survey the wider rodent <lb/>ARDEB literature and not focus on any single manipulation, for interventions with more than <lb/>fifteen eligible studies, a maximum of fifteen studies was randomly selected for inclusion. <lb/>Sampling was done by randomly sorting the PubMed IDs in Excel and selecting the first <lb/>fifteen articles in each re-ordered list. The included studies used the two-independent-<lb/>groups design with sample sizes typically N = ~10 control animals and N = ~10 intervention <lb/>animals. Thus randomly sampling fifteen studies would bring the total iterations to N = <lb/>~150, ~150. From the significance testing perspective, assuming modest heterogeneity (an <lb/></body>

From the estimation perspective, precision would be predicted to improve by nearly <lb/>4-fold (= √150 ÷ √10) relative to primary results, also assuming modest heterogeneity. <lb/>Data items and extraction <lb/>The following data were collected from each of the included studies: authors, year of <lb/>publication, figure and panel numbers, species, genotype, and mean, standard error of the <lb/>mean and sample size (N) of each intervention and its related control group. Graphically <lb/>presented data were extracted from Portable Document Format (PDF) files with the <lb/>Measuring Tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro. A sample of ten randomly selected experiments <lb/>were re-extracted by a second reader to compare the effect of individual extractions; the <lb/>difference between the two extractions was g = 0.03 [95% confidence interval (95CI) 0.01, <lb/>0.05] on average, a negligible influence on meta-analytic effect sizes. <lb/>Summary measures <lb/>The following behavioral metrics were extracted from the articles: in OF studies, percent or <lb/>total time spent at the center; in EPM studies, percent or total time spent on the open arm; <lb/>in LD studies, percent or total time spent in the bright area. To synthesize these time-based <lb/>metrics from the three assays, all estimates were standardized to Hedges&apos; g, where g is a <lb/>preferred variant of Cohen&apos;s d that uses the pooled standard deviation and is corrected for <lb/>bias using Hedges&apos; method (Cumming, 2012; Borenstein et al., 2011). The conventional <lb/>adjectives to describe effect size (trivial, small, moderate, large) are used where appropriate <lb/>(Cumming, 2012). <lb/></body>

            <body>Synthesis of results <lb/>Meta-analyses of experimental outcomes, including the calculation of weighted mean effect <lb/>sizes (Hedges&apos; g), 95% confidence intervals, I 2 heterogeneity values, and p values using the <lb/>random effects model, were performed with the metafor package in R (http://CRAN.R-<lb/>project.org/package=metafor) (Viechtbauer, 2010). All error bars in forest plots are 95% <lb/>confidence intervals; forest plots were generated with metafor and custom R scripts and <lb/>formatted in Adobe Illustrator. <lb/>Assessment of bias across studies <lb/>Publication bias was assessed using Egger&apos;s linear regression test for funnel plot <lb/>asymmetry (Egger et al., 1997). The standard normal deviate (Hedges&apos; g / standard error) <lb/>for each study was regressed against the study&apos;s precision (1 / standard error) using the <lb/>&quot;lm&quot; function in R (http://www.R-project.org/). For studies that had evidence of publication <lb/>bias (p-value ≤ 0.05), the trim-and-fill method (Duval and Tweedie, 2000) was employed to <lb/>estimate the effects of publication bias on the effect size estimate. Funnel plots and trim-<lb/>and-fill adjustments were performed with the &apos;metafor&apos; package in R (Viechtbauer, 2010). <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>Review selection criteria identified 179 eligible articles <lb/>The flow-chart in Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process. In total, 585 articles <lb/>were identified by the initial PubMed searches. According to the selection criteria described <lb/>above, 249 studies were excluded based on their titles and a further 65 were excluded <lb/>based on their abstracts. The full text of the remaining 271 articles were screened for <lb/>criteria related to experimental paradigm, methods, and relevant variables, resulting in the <lb/>exclusion of a further 92 studies. A total of 179 articles were considered eligible for <lb/>inclusion in the review. Random selection of a maximum of fifteen studies for each <lb/>intervention reduced the final number to 87 articles for use in the meta-analyses. <lb/>Characteristics of included experiments <lb/>The characteristics of all included studies are given in Table 3. In brief, 87 studies <lb/>comprising 97 EPM experiments, 37 OF experiments and 22 LD experiments were <lb/>identified. Studies were published between 1993 and 2013 and included data from 109 <lb/>experiments conducted on mice and 48 experiments on rats. ARDEB studies of diazepam <lb/>used a median dosage of 1 mg/kg, with minimum and maximum dosages of 0.5 mg/kg and <lb/>5 mg/kg respectively. This dose range is similar to or higher than commonly used by <lb/>patients. <lb/>Heterogeneity <lb/>Statistically significant heterogeneity was found in (8/12) of the meta-analyses. Only two <lb/>meta-analyses had high heterogeneity (I 2 &gt; 75%): Htr1a overexpression, and physical <lb/>restraint (Higgins et al., 2003). Three of the meta-analyses, Htr1a knockouts and Htt <lb/>knockouts and isolation, had moderate heterogeneity (50% &lt; I 2 &lt; 75%). However, the <lb/>majority (seven meta-analyses) had low heterogeneity (I 2 &lt; 50%). As most of these <lb/>syntheses contained data from more than one assay type, it is encouraging that most had <lb/></body>

            <body>low or moderate heterogeneity; this outcome is compatible with the idea that the three <lb/>ARDEB assays are testing similar aspects of rodent behavior. <lb/>Publication bias <lb/>Censorship of statistically non-significant results can result in the overstatement of effect <lb/>sizes in meta-analyses, for example this effect has a profound influence on the literature on <lb/>rodent models of stroke (Sena et al., 2010). Publication bias in the ARDEB literature was <lb/>assessed for the five meta-analyses that had at least ten experiments (Table 2) (Sterne et <lb/>al., 2011). Funnel plots and Egger&apos;s linear regression test for asymmetry revealed that three <lb/>of these literatures showed statistically significant bias (Figure 2; Table 2). Funnel plot <lb/>asymmetry can arise from publication bias, the censorship of experiments showing small <lb/>and/or statistically non-significant effect sizes (the file drawer effect) (Sterne et al., 2011). <lb/>For the three biased data sets, we used trim-and-fill adjustment to correct for the funnel <lb/>plot asymmetry and estimate the number of hypothesized missing studies (Duval and <lb/>Tweedie, 2000). We conclude that the literatures of diazepam, Htt knockout and social <lb/>isolation effects on ARDEB are affected by publication bias. <lb/>Diazepam produces a moderate reduction in defense behaviors <lb/>Diazepam is an important minor tranquilizer that was used for several decades as the first <lb/>line of treatment for anxiety disorders (Tone, 2009) and, along with other benzodiazepines, <lb/>is still used extensively to control anxiety (Baldwin et al., 2014). Recent clinical meta-<lb/>analysis studies have found support for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the short-term <lb/>treatment of anxiety disorders (Baldwin et al., 2014). However, a published review of <lb/>diazepam effects in open field studies revealed widespread disagreement between with 29 <lb/>studies supporting an anxiolytic effect and 23 supporting either an anxiogenic effect or no <lb/>effect (Prut and Belzung, 2003). We reviewed the available literature on diazepam for the <lb/>three major rodent ARDEB assays: EPM, OF and LD. For the meta-analysis, data was <lb/></body>

			<body>extracted from a randomized subset of fifteen studies (out of 62 eligible papers) (Brioni et <lb/>al., 1994; Faria et al., 1997; Boerngen-Lacerda and Souza-Formigoni, 2000; LaBuda and <lb/>Fuchs, 2001; Hui et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2004; Jain et al., 2005; Jászberényi et al., 2009; <lb/>Frassetto et al., 2010; Wanasuntronwong et al., 2012; Onusic et al., 2002; Birkett et al., <lb/>2011; Costa et al., 2011; Choleris et al., 2001; González-Pardo et al., 2006). Calculation of <lb/>an average Hedges&apos; g (Cumming, 2012) revealed that diazepam had a moderate effect on <lb/>ARDEB, with a -0.89 g [95CI -1.12, -0.6] reduction compared with untreated control animals <lb/>(Figure 3). However, Egger&apos;s regression indicated the source literature was affected by <lb/>publication bias, trim-and-fill adjustment reduced the effect size to -0.64 g [95CI -0.37, -<lb/>0.91], a -0.25 g reduction in the anxiolytic effect of this drug. The meta-analysis had a low <lb/>level of heterogeneity, indicating that the assay type, laboratory, dosage, species, strain <lb/>and other possible sources of experimental variation played a relatively minor role. <lb/>5-HT1A receptor function influences ARDEB <lb/>Following negative publicity regarding the adverse effects of benzodiazepines (Tone, 2009), <lb/>pharmaceutical companies focused on the serotonergic system (Griebel and Holmes, 2013). <lb/>Of the fourteen mammalian serotonergic receptors, the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A has <lb/>been targeted for its proposed connection with anxiety disorders and depression (Samuels <lb/>et al., 2014). More than 1200 articles describe experiments relating 5-HT1A agonism to <lb/>anxiety (Griebel and Holmes, 2013). However, a substantial proportion of those articles <lb/>reported that 5-HT1A agonists or knockout of the Htr1a gene either produced no effect on <lb/>anxiety or an effect that was opposite to the receptor&apos;s proposed mode of action (Griebel <lb/>and Holmes, 2013). We performed systematic reviews of gene manipulations of Htr1a. <lb/>Meta-analysis of data from eleven knockout articles (Ramboz et al., 1998; Gross et al., <lb/>2002; Groenink et al., 2003; Gleason et al., 2010; Freeman-Daniels et al., 2011; Ferrés-Coy <lb/>et al., 2013; Klemenhagen et al., 2006; Parks et al., 1998; Vinkers et al., 2010; Zanettini et <lb/></body>

            <note place="footnote">al., 2010; Jain et al., 2012) revealed that removal of Htr1a produced a moderate increase <lb/>(Hedges&apos; g = 0.68 [95CI 0.38, 0.97] , p = 8.9 x 10 -06 ) in ARDEB phenotypes (Figure 4A). The <lb/>three studies of Htr1a overexpression found by the review (Kusserow et al., 2004; Bert et <lb/>al., 2006; Audero et al., 2013) indicate that this intervention moderately decreased ARDEB, <lb/>but this was not statistically significant (g = -0.52 [95CI -1.26, 0.23], p = 0.18; Figure 4B). <lb/>Overall, these results indicate there remains discordance regarding 5-HT1A function. While <lb/>the knockout has a moderate anxiogenic effect, Htr1a overexpression does not have a <lb/>statistically significant impact. A large cumulative sample size contributes to the ineffective <lb/>overexpression result (N = 144). These results verify the no-ARDEB effect hypothesis for <lb/>this treatment, indicating that Htr1a overexpression does not influence rodent defense <lb/>behaviors. <lb/>Anxiotropic effects of the serotonin transporter <lb/>The serotonin transporter (SERT) is the target for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors <lb/>(SSRIs), a class of drugs used to treat depression and anxiety (Baldwin et al., 2014). Meta-<lb/>analysis of thirteen knockout studies (Holmes et al., 2003b; 2003a; Lira et al., 2003; Li et al., <lb/>2004; Carroll et al., 2007; Kalueff et al., 2007a; Olivier et al., 2008; Line et al., 2011; <lb/>Schipper et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2006; Kalueff et al., 2007b; Moya et al., 2011; Pang et al., <lb/>2011) revealed a large anxiogenic ARDEB effect (g = 0.88 [95CI -1.26, 0.23] , p = 5.2 x 10 -14 ; <lb/>Figure 5A) produced by knocking out the SERT gene, Htt. However, a funnel plot and <lb/>Egger&apos;s regression revealed a pronounced bias in reported effect sizes (Egger&apos;s test p = 6.7 <lb/>X 10 -6 , Table 2). Trim-and-fill adjustment filled the left segment of the funnel plot with ten <lb/>imputed data points so as to obtain a symmetric funnel plot, reducing the effect size to g = <lb/>0.57 [95CI 0.29, 0.86]. <lb/>Only two articles studying the effect of Htt overexpression on ARDEB were found <lb/>(Jennings et al., 2006; Line et al., 2011). Meta-analysis revealed a large anxiolytic effect (g = <lb/></note>

The transporter gene knockout and overexpression effects clearly connect Htt <lb/>function to ARDEB/ However, the direction of effects is the opposite of what would be <lb/>expected from the clinical application of Htt inhibitors, given that SSRI reduction of Htt <lb/>function is thought to have a therapeutic anxiety-reducing effect. <lb/>The effects of environmental stressors in ARDEB <lb/>Environmental stressors have physiological effects on animals that promote the anxiety-like <lb/>state (van Praag, 2003). To survey a range of stress modalities we chose acute pain, bodily <lb/>restraint and social isolation for review; all three are known to promote anxiety in humans <lb/>(Sherif and Oreland, 1995). The systematic review identified only five papers measuring the <lb/>effect of acute pain on ARDEB (Schellinck et al., 2003; Benbouzid et al., 2008; Parent et al., <lb/>2012; Leite-Almeida et al., 2012; Matsuzawa-Yanagida et al., 2008), but meta-analysis of <lb/>these indicated a very large anxiogenic effect (g = 1.49 [95CI 1.12, 1.87], p = 5.8 x 10 -15 ; <lb/>Figure 6A). <lb/>Review of fifteen studies of rodent bodily restraint (Carvajal et al., 2004; Lunga and <lb/>Herbert, 2004; Estanislau and Morato, 2005; Hsu et al., 2007; Locchi et al., 2008; Nosek et <lb/>al., 2008; Rylkova et al., 2009; Granjeiro et al., 2011; Reis et al., 2011; Anand et al., 2012; <lb/>Walf and Frye, 2012; Busnardo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Ouagazzal et al., 2003; <lb/>Chesworth et al., 2012) indicated that it had an overall moderate anxiogenic effect in EPM <lb/>and OF assays (g = 0.70 [ 95% CI 0.82 -1.32], p = 0.027; Figure 6B).

However, Egger&apos;s regression revealed funnel plot <lb/>asymmetry, while trim-and-fill adjustment reduced the anxiogenic effect to only 0.15 g <lb/>[95CI -0.10, 0.40], a small and statistically non-significant effect on ARDEB (Figure 2). It <lb/>appears that, unlike the physical stressors, social isolation does not have an influence on <lb/>ARDEB, thus supporting the no-ARDEB hypothesis. <lb/>The role of CRH and its receptor on ARDEB <lb/>Several neuropeptide-related genes involved in stress signaling have been linked to anxiety, <lb/>notably the peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; also known as corticotropin-<lb/>releasing factor) (Kormos and Gaszner, 2013) and its receptor, CRHR1. Two studies that <lb/>examined the effects of Crh knockouts on ARDEB were found (Weninger et al., 1999), which <lb/>revealed only a small effect (g = 0.30 [95CI -0.32, 0.92], p = 0.34; Figure 7A). This supports <lb/>the idea that CRH does not influence ARDEB, and supports the no-ARDEB hypothesis. <lb/>However, the meta-analytic result may suffer from insufficient power as the cumulative <lb/>sample size was only 41. <lb/>CRH exerts its biological action via two receptors known as CRHR1 and CRHR2. <lb/>The two receptors are pharmacologically distinct and only the former has been widely <lb/>studied in the context of anxiety (Owens and Nemeroff, 1991; Paez-Pereda et al., 2011). <lb/>Meta-analysis (Liebsch et al., 1995; 1999; Smith et al., 1998; Müller et al., 2003; Gammie <lb/>and Stevenson, 2006; Trimble et al., 2007) found that, in contrast to the Crh knockout, <lb/>deletion of Crhr1 had a large anxiolytic effect on ARDEB (g = -1.0 [95CI -1.30, -0.70], p = <lb/></body>

The discordance between Crh and Crhr1 knockout effects has <lb/>previously been attributed to the action of either urocortin or another unidentified peptide <lb/>ligand of Crhr1 (Dunn and Swiergiel, 1999). <lb/>Genes with no purported effect on anxiety <lb/>Some of the interventions in the systematic review were found to have modest effects on <lb/>ARDEB. We aimed to contextualize the magnitude of proposed anxiety factors with factors <lb/>that the literature has not connected with anxiety. Such factors are not generally mentioned <lb/>in anxiety reviews and it is difficult to identify them with PubMed searches as they are less <lb/>likely to be published or, when published, are unlikely to be the focus of a study and thus <lb/>may not be mentioned in the abstract. We adopted an ad hoc search for systems <lb/>unimportant to anxiety, which identified adenylyl cyclase 1 (Storm et al., 1998; Krishnan et <lb/>al., 2008) and synaptotagmin 1 (Powell et al., 2004) as being proposed to have no anxiety-<lb/>related activity. Meta-analyses confirmed that both interventions have very small (Hedges&apos; g <lb/>&lt; 0.3) and non-statistically significant effects on ARDEB (Figure 8A-B). These results <lb/>indicate that anxiety factors generally appear to have an ARDEB effect that is at least twice <lb/>the magnitude of factors believed to be unimportant to anxiety. <lb/></body>

            <body>DISCUSSION <lb/>Summary of evidence <lb/>Inspection of the forest plots reveals that all of the primary publication sets include <lb/>experimental effect sizes that are discordant, either in direction (anxiolytic versus <lb/>anxiogenic) and/or magnitude. The generality of discordance in the literature emphasizes <lb/>the critical utility of meta-analysis to behavioral neuroscience. Of ten analyses of putative <lb/>anxiotropic interventions, seven yielded substantial meta-analytic effect sizes that were <lb/>statistical and three produced non-statistically significant effect sizes, once publication bias <lb/>was accounted for (Figure 9). Overall, these results verify the no-ARDEB-effect hypothesis <lb/>in a minority of cases (Htr1a overexpression, Crh and social isolation): their consensus <lb/>effect sizes are comparable with &apos;non-anxiety&apos; genes like Syt1. However, the majority of <lb/>putative anxiety-related genes do have at least moderate effects on the rodent defense <lb/>behaviors. The synthetic data strongly confirm that diazepam, the serotonergic system, <lb/>environmental stressors, and Crhr1 influence an anxiety-like process in the mouse brain. <lb/>Knowledge gaps, publication bias and heterogeneity <lb/>We found no knowledge gaps per se, as all the purported anxiety-related factors had at <lb/>least two studies. Only Htt overexpression, Crh knockouts and the non-anxiety genes had <lb/>total experimental iterations below N = 64, 64, the sample size needed for 80% power to <lb/>detect a 0.5 standard deviation effect size. However, the Ht1a overexpression and CRH <lb/>knockout meta-analytic results remain imprecise (Figure 9), indicating that more work could <lb/>be done here. Of the five intensively published factors (15 studies or more), three were <lb/>affected by publication bias, suggesting that publication bias affects a majority of literatures <lb/>in this area. Heterogeneity was encouragingly low for the literatures of most of the factors <lb/>reviewed, suggesting that laboratory, strain, assay type and protocol variations play a <lb/>relatively minor role in these experiments. <lb/></body>

            <body>Gains of function in Htr1a has a weak effect on ARDEB <lb/>Meta-analysis of Htr1a overexpression revealed that is has a moderate anxiolytic effect, but <lb/>that this is not statistically significant. Substantial numbers of animals were used to obtain <lb/>this results (N = 72, 72), though the meta-analysis also displayed a high level of <lb/>heterogeneity (I 2 = 59%). That overexpression of Htr1a has a weak effect suggests that <lb/>aiming to increase 5-HT1A function may be a poor strategy to reduce anxiety, despite the <lb/>pronounced Htr1a knockout outcome. This conclusion is supported by recent clinical meta-<lb/>analyses that have concluded that drugs targeting 5-HT1A -the azapirones -appear <lb/>inferior to benzodiazepines for generalized anxiety disorder (Chessick et al., 2006) and that <lb/>there is insufficient evidence to support azapirone use in panic disorder (Imai et al., 2014). <lb/>The Htt-SSRI paradox in defense behaviors <lb/>Drugs that target SERT, the SSRIs, are recommended as the first line of pharmacological <lb/>treatment for anxiety (Baldwin et al., 2014). Blocking SERT-mediated transport (reuptake) of <lb/>serotonin from the synaptic cleft is the proposed mechanism of anxiety reduction (Perez-<lb/>Caballero et al., 2014). Rodent studies of chronic SSRI effects on ARDEB have been <lb/>inconclusive (Perez-Caballero et al., 2014; Griebel and Holmes, 2013). Given the the <lb/>inhibitors&apos; clinical use, it is surprising that Htt knockouts have elevated anxiety relative to <lb/>controls and that Htt overexpression reduces ARDEB phenotypes. The reason for this <lb/>discordance is not clear. In some cases the authors of the primary Htt knockout studies <lb/>have not discussed this paradox (Moya et al., 2011; Schipper et al., 2011; Carroll et al., <lb/>2007; Kalueff et al., 2007a). Other authors have remarked that the underlying reason <lb/>remains unclear (Lira et al., 2003; Holmes et al., 2003b) or have questioned the validity of <lb/>ARDEB assays (Pang et al., 2011). Primary study authors have also proposed two <lb/>explanatory hypotheses. The first is that increased anxiety arises from developmental <lb/>alterations present in Htt knockouts not present in chronically drug-treated animals (Olivier <lb/></body>

            <body>et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2006; Holmes et al., 2003b). This hypothesis could be tested with <lb/>conditional knockdown models, i.e. in animals with Htt only deleted at the adult stage. <lb/>While systematic review did not identify any published reports of post-developmental Htt <lb/>knockout experiments (e.g., using floxed Htt), researchers have looked at the anxiety-<lb/>related effects of conditionally ablating the Pet-1 gene. Pet-1 is a transcription factor with <lb/>an expression pattern that overlaps closely with Htt&apos;s expression pattern. In mice with Pet-1 <lb/>removed in adulthood, mRNA levels of Htt are also reduced substantially (Liu et al., 2010). <lb/>Like Htt knockouts, these mice show increased anxiety-like behaviors in multiple ARDEB <lb/>assays (Liu et al., 2010), eroding confidence in the developmental alteration hypothesis. A <lb/>second hypothesis to explain the Htt/SSRI paradox is that there is a J-shaped relationship <lb/>between Htt function and anxiety, i.e., both wild-type and knock-out animals would have <lb/>higher anxiety relative to animals with intermediate function (Olivier et al., 2008). Further <lb/>study is required to fully understand the role of Htt and SSRIs in ARDEB. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>This study supports the hypothesis that some mainstream anxiety-related interventions <lb/>have trivial or unconfirmed effects in rodent defense behavior assays. However, this study <lb/>also confirms a drug, two environmental stressors and a number of genes as authentic <lb/>ARDEB influencers. These verified anxiety-related interventions (diazepam, Htr1a gene <lb/>knockout, Htt gene knockout, Htt gene overexpression, acute pain, restraint and Crhr1 <lb/>gene knockout) can be used as reference manipulations to validate other animal models of <lb/>anxiety-like behavior. <lb/>Meta-analysis has the ability to aggregate information and resolve discordance in <lb/>the primary literature. This ability may be particularly useful in behavioral neuroscience <lb/>where most primary articles describe experiments with low power (or precision) (Button et <lb/>al., 2013). Precise estimation of effect magnitude is important both to build quantitative <lb/></body>

The hori-<lb/>ontal a is is Hedges&apos; g, the standard deviation change relative to control animals. Color <lb/>indicates direction (green = anxiolytic, red = anxiogenic) and statistical significance (grey <lb/>= statistically non-significant). The diamonds for the diazepam, social isolation, and Htt KO <lb/>meta-analyses represent the summary effect sizes after trim-and-fill bias correction. <lb/>Table 1.
