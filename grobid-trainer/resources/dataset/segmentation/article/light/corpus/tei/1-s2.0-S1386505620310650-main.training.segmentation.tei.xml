As more countries launch <lb/>national EHR programmes, it is critical that the most up-to-date and relevant international learnings are shared <lb/>with key stakeholders. <lb/>Methods: A rapid umbrella review was undertaken in collaboration with a multidisciplinary panel of knowledge-<lb/>users and experts from Ireland. A comprehensive literature review was completed (2019) across several search <lb/>engines (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ProQuest, <lb/>Cochrane) and Gray literature. Identified studies (n = 5,040) were subject to eligibility criterion and identified <lb/>barriers and facilitators were analysed, reviewed, discussed and interpreted by the expert panel. <lb/>Results: Twenty-seven literature reviews were identified which captured the key organizational, human and <lb/>technological factors for a successful EHR implementation according to various stakeholders across different <lb/>settings. Although the size, type and culture of the healthcare setting impacted on the organizational factors, <lb/>each was deemed important for EHR success; Governance, leadership and culture, End-user involvement, Training, <lb/>Support, Resourcing, and Workflows. As well as organizational differences, individual end-users have varying Skills <lb/>and characteristics, Perceived benefits and incentives, and Perceived changes to the health ecosystem which were also <lb/>critical to success. Finally, the success of the EHR technology depended on Usability, Interoperability, Adaptability, <lb/>Infrastructure, Regulation, standards and policies, and Testing. <lb/>Conclusion: Fifteen inter-linked organizational, human and technological factors emerged as important for suc-<lb/>cessful EHR implementations across primary, secondary and long-term care settings. In determining how to <lb/>employ these factors, the local context, individual end-users and advancing technology must also be considered. <lb/>* Corresponding author. <lb/>E-mail addresses: orna.fennelly@ucdconnect.ie (O.

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Capturing and effectively using clinical information and knowl-<lb/>edge to ensure a quality, safe and sustainable healthcare service is <lb/>widely recognised as important [1,2] and data from electronic health <lb/>records (EHRs) have been vital to decision-making on public health <lb/>policies during the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. An EHR provides a <lb/>longitudinal record of information regarding the health status of an <lb/>individual in computer-processible form across practices and spe-<lb/>cialists, and enables authorised access to clinical records in real-time <lb/>[4,5]. As well as expanding the capacity to utilise clinical data for <lb/>monitoring of patient outcomes and conducting audits and research <lb/>[6,7], the EHR provides access to patient information in a timely <lb/>manner, enabling healthcare professionals (HCPs) to spend more time <lb/>with patients 8 , reducing duplication of tests and work, and improving <lb/>the safety and quality of care provided [4,7,9-14]. Additionally, <lb/>integration of other functions and software, such as clinical decision <lb/>support and bar code medication administration, further expand its <lb/>potential benefits [15,16]. <lb/>Electronic patient records (EPRs) or electronic medical records <lb/>(EMRs) also offer many of these benefits but solely contain the records <lb/>from an individual organization. Whilst shared or summary care records <lb/>and patient portals respectively store and facilitate access to specific <lb/>patient information required by HCPs [17] and patients [18]. Despite <lb/>the number of benefits which can be derived from these systems, chal-<lb/>lenges have been met in implementing a fully interoperable EHR be-<lb/>tween primary and secondary care [13,19], often attributed to the <lb/>implementation process as opposed to the product supplied by the EHR <lb/>vendor [20,21]. Therefore, the implementation process is critical [22] <lb/>and must be considered as an ongoing process beginning during pro-<lb/>curement and continuing throughout each phase of design, develop-<lb/>ment, testing, &apos;Go Live&apos; and optimization. <lb/>Whilst hospital information systems (HIS) in the USA have been in <lb/>existence since the 1960s [23], HIS are a more recent phenomenon in <lb/>the Republic of Ireland where public healthcare is managed by the <lb/>Health Service Executive (HSE) which co-exists with a private health <lb/>system. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) has overall <lb/>responsibility for embedding technology within the health infra-<lb/>structure [24] and to date, EPRs have been implemented in some <lb/>individual private and public hospitals and the majority of general <lb/>practitioner (GP) offices (i.e., private primary care physicians often <lb/>with HSE contracts), as well as for specific cohorts of patients (e.g., <lb/>maternal and newborn, and epilepsy) [25]. However, many other <lb/>hospitals and HSE primary care (i.e., community) centres remain <lb/>largely paper-based. With an EHR in the pipeline [24,26], three na-<lb/>tional projects have been planned by eHealth Ireland which is led by <lb/>the Office of the CIO; Acute EHR, Community EHR and the Shared <lb/>and Integrated Care Record. Therefore, this is an opportune time for <lb/>policy-makers and other key stakeholders to review the learnings <lb/>from the implementations of health information technology (HIT) <lb/>both in Ireland and internationally. <lb/>However, a vast amount of literature is published on topics such as <lb/>EHRs which renders it difficult for policy-makers to remain up-to-date <lb/>[27,28], perhaps amplifying the &quot;know-do&quot; gap. Additionally, <lb/>healthcare is a complex and adaptive system which needs to be <lb/>recognized and acknowledged when attempting to replicate successes <lb/>in another context [29]. The EHR programme in Ireland is also <lb/>already underway and therefore, it&apos;s critical that knowledge is <lb/>generated to provide actionable and relevant key considerations in a <lb/>timely manner aligned with the policy and decision-making cycles <lb/>[30]. Therefore, the aim of this review is to identify and explore the <lb/>key factors which promote a successful EHR implementation across <lb/>healthcare settings, with active collaboration from key stakeholders <lb/>in the Irish context. <lb/>2. Methods <lb/>2.1. Design <lb/>A rapid umbrella review was conducted and guided by the World <lb/>Health Organisation (WHO) practical guide for Rapid Reviews to <lb/>Strengthen Health Policy and Systems [31]. Unlike a systematic review, an <lb/>umbrella review also known as a review of reviews, compiles evidence <lb/>from several research syntheses across different healthcare contexts and <lb/>stakeholder groups [32,33]. Active collaboration with an expert panel of <lb/>knowledge users facilitated the acceleration of the systematic review <lb/>process [30] and to facilitate uptake and use of these findings by plan-<lb/>ners and decision-makers, the synthesized findings were also presented <lb/>in a report format [34]. <lb/>2.2. Expert panel of knowledge users <lb/>A multi-disciplinary panel of experts and knowledge users (n = 10) <lb/>were engaged and involved throughout the review process to inform its <lb/>methodology, validate the generalizability and relevance of the review <lb/>findings [35], and ensure it reflects current thinking and is useful [27]. <lb/>The panel was convened in January 2019 by the Office of Nursing and <lb/>Midwifery Services Director (HSE) and comprised of those currently <lb/>involved in large HIT implementation projects across primary and sec-<lb/>ondary care at local and national levels in Ireland, as well as clinicians, <lb/>health service researchers and academic partners from healthcare and <lb/>health informatic backgrounds (Table 1). Five consultative in-person <lb/>group meetings and several individual meetings and email exchanges <lb/>within the group were conducted throughout the review process. <lb/>2.3. Research question and search strategy <lb/>An initial exploratory scope of the EHR literature in the PubMed <lb/>database was reviewed by the expert panel and the final research <lb/>question, methodology and search strategy were developed and agreed. <lb/>A large number of search terms to describe &quot;Electronic Health Record&quot;, <lb/>&quot;Implementation&quot; and &quot;Literature Review&quot; were identified from previous <lb/>systematic reviews [7,36-40], additional literature [17], medical sub-<lb/>ject heading and controlled vocabulary and via consultation with the <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Positions held by the members of the Expert Panel (n = 10). <lb/>National Clinical Information Officer for Nursing and Midwifery, HSE. <lb/>Professor of Health Informatics, UCD. <lb/>Group Chief Information Officer, Ireland East Hospital Group, HSE. <lb/>ICT Project Manager, Office of the Clinical Information Officer, HSE. <lb/>Senior Clinical Psychologist, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dublin. <lb/>Clinical Health and Social Care Professional Lead in the Clinical Management System, <lb/>National Rehabilitation Hospital. <lb/>Associate Professor in Physiotherapy, UCD. <lb/>Business Manager, National MN-CMS Project Team. <lb/>Community EHR Senior Project Manager, HSE. <lb/>General Practitioner (GP). <lb/>National Co-ordinator of the GPIT Project at the Irish College of General Practitioners. <lb/>Senior Professional Officer, Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for <lb/>Nursing and Midwifery. <lb/>EPR Project Manager, St. James&apos; Hospital, Dublin. <lb/>Engagement and Delivery Lead, Informatics Directorate, St. James&apos;s Hospital, Dublin. <lb/>Physiotherapist. <lb/>Note: Some members of the expert panel had more than one position.

			<body>expert panel and an experienced information technologist at the Health <lb/>Sciences Library, UCD [Appendix]. The search string was tailored to the <lb/>indexing language of each database and in March 2019, it was executed <lb/>across PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, <lb/>ACM Digital Library, ProQuest and Cochrane, with limitations of English <lb/>language and published since 2010. Grey literature including reports <lb/>and conference proceedings were also searched (international Health <lb/>Informatics Societies, the World Health Organization (WHO), European <lb/>e-health network, Kings Fund, Gartner and Lenus). Panellists also drew <lb/>on their expertise to identify any additional relevant sources [35]. <lb/>2.4. Identification of literature reviews <lb/>Identified articles were calibrated in the citation management soft-<lb/>ware Endnote version x9.2 and titles and abstracts were screened by one <lb/>researcher using the inclusion and exclusion criteria agreed with the <lb/>expert panel (Table 2). Full text articles were then accessed and screened <lb/>by the same researcher, with any doubts regarding inclusion or exclu-<lb/>sion discussed with the panel to overcome any risk of errors or in-<lb/>consistencies associated with using one reviewer [31]. In line with our <lb/>chosen rapid review methodology, a quality assessment of identified <lb/>reviews was not conducted. <lb/>2.5. Data extraction and synthesis <lb/>A standardized data extraction form was developed and included <lb/>authors, year of publication, study design, participants, healthcare <lb/>setting, included studies and findings related to factors impacting on the <lb/>implementation (i.e., themes and/or paragraphs as required). Following <lb/>data extraction, a qualitative content analysis of the factors impacting <lb/>on the EHR implementation was undertaken by the researcher [41]. <lb/>Using an iterative process, a list of codes representing the identified <lb/>factors from each of the literature reviews was formed [42]. The expert <lb/>panel reviewed these codes via an adapted nominal group technique, <lb/>which saw collated appraisals distributed amongst the panellists [43] to <lb/>assess whether they were comprehensive of the literature and their own <lb/>experiences, and to determine whether the findings could be transferred <lb/>to Irish contexts and settings [42]. Having reached a final consensus <lb/>regarding the factors for a successful EHR implementation, these factors <lb/>were further categorized into a theoretical framework [10] and resulted <lb/>in the generation of key considerations [42]. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. Characteristics of literature reviews <lb/>Of the 5,040 articles retrieved, 27 literature reviews were identified <lb/>which captured factors deemed important for the successful imple-<lb/>mentation of EHRs, as well as other HIT implementations (Fig. 1). <lb/>Fifteen were classified as systematic reviews, whilst the others were <lb/>umbrella reviews (n = 3), scoping reviews (n = 2), interpretive review <lb/>(n = 1), literature review with a meta-narrative (n = 1) and other non-<lb/>systematic literature reviews (n = 5).

			<body>reviews, reports, books and guidelines identified. Perspectives of a va-<lb/>riety of stakeholders were captured in these reviews including GPs (or <lb/>primary care physicians), other doctors, nurses, health and social care <lb/>professionals (HCPs), patients, policymakers, vendors and IT consultants <lb/>(Table 3). Although many literature reviews encompassed studies from a <lb/>variety of healthcare settings, others were specific to primary care (i.e., <lb/>community) [13,44,45], long term care [46] and mental health settings <lb/>[47] or within specific countries or groups of countries [19,48-51]. <lb/>3.2. Synthesized findings <lb/>Fifteen common factors were identified and classified as organiza-<lb/>tional, human and technological. Each of these factors are discussed in <lb/>detail below as well as how they interact within different contexts. <lb/>3.2.1. Organizational factors <lb/>Factors relating to the processes by which the EHR was introduced <lb/>and incorporated into routine care were categorized as organizational <lb/>[54]. Whilst each of the six factors were important across all contexts, <lb/>the size and type of organization impacted on how each triggered suc-<lb/>cess during the EHR implementation [46,53,61]. <lb/>3.2.1.1. Governance, leadership and culture. The governance of the EHR <lb/>implementation [13,19,37], as well as leaders [7,10,36,44,48,52-54,62, <lb/>63] and organizational culture, were identified as paramount in <lb/>ensuring a successful EHR system [7,10,13,36,45,50-53,56,59,62]. <lb/>Whilst top-down, middle-out and bottom-up governance structures have <lb/>been utilised, ongoing political willingness, national policies and some <lb/>independence at an individual organizational level regarding EHR pro-<lb/>curement, development and design, were recommended to promote <lb/>engagement, usability and interoperability [13,48,51,62]. It was also <lb/>important that executive leaders such as CIOs and project management <lb/>teams establish good and trusting relationships with vendors and <lb/>consulting firms [12,44,52,56,63], and designed the implementation <lb/>strategy with clear measurable objectives [10,50,52], a fitting imple-<lb/>mentation process (e.g., big-bang or phased) [44,46,51,58], and clear <lb/>roles and divisions of labour [10,60]. A shift away from the dominance <lb/>of top and middle management has also been recommended [10,19,36], <lb/>with the appointment of local leaders or champions, and supporting of <lb/>internal and external communication and collaboration [10,11,19,52, <lb/>59], innovation and continual improvement [52], and patient-centred <lb/>care [19]. This also helps to create a favourable [10,36,44,63] and <lb/>flexible [52] culture. <lb/>3.2.1.2. End-user involvement. During each stage of the EHR imple-<lb/>mentation process, end-user involvement was highlighted as important <lb/>[7,10,37,47,48,52,54,56,57,60,62,63], as it helps to ensure that the <lb/>EHR meets end-users&apos; needs and workflows, as well as promoting a sense <lb/>of ownership [37] and acceptance amongst staff [10,37,63]. Engaging <lb/>end-users from each stakeholder group was recommended [36], and this <lb/>has often been done in the form of appointing champions. These leaders <lb/>should be respected amongst their colleagues as well as having the <lb/>relevant knowledge to act as a bridge between the end-users and IT staff <lb/>[60,62,63]. However, champions may sometimes need to be shared be-<lb/>tween organizations [10]. <lb/>3.2.1.3. Training. Basic computer and EHR-specific training were <lb/>identified as key to a successful EHR implementation [7,10,12,13,19,36, <lb/>37,45,46,48,50-53,56,57,60,61,63]. However, the effectiveness and <lb/>resource-efficiency of training depended on the appropriateness of the <lb/>appointed trainers, training content, timing of training (i.e., as close to <lb/>Go Live as possible [36]) and methods of training e.g., classroom based <lb/>versus eLearning [57]. EHR training was also recommended on an <lb/>ongoing basis for new staff, as well as existing staff to optimize their use <lb/>of the system [37,53]. <lb/>3.2.1.4. Support. Expert, technical, executive and external support have <lb/>been critical to successful EHR implementations [7,10-13,19,36,37,44, <lb/>50-53,56-58,60-63]. Expert or peer support, often referred to as <lb/>super-users, reportedly helped end-users to optimize their use of the EHR <lb/>[7,11,12,36,53], whereas technical support staff helped solve IT issues <lb/>[51,62]. During Go Live (often first 3-4 weeks [37]), technical and peer <lb/>support should be available 24/7 seven days a week in hospitals [12,36]. <lb/>However, this may not be feasible or required in primary care centres <lb/>but channels to obtain support during working hours remain important. <lb/>Other crucial support comes from an executive or policy level [19,50,52, <lb/>53,56,57,60,63] and professional networks or external parties [19,53]. <lb/>Although maintenance support for servers and networks was not as <lb/>evidenced in the identified literature [50], the expert panel also deemed <lb/>this as important. <lb/>3.2.1.5. Resourcing. The availability of resources in terms of finance, <lb/>skilled workforce and time was also important [7,10,12,13,36,37, <lb/>44-46,48,49,51-54,56,59-63]. Financial resourcing was often high-<lb/>lighted as a barrier especially by primary care doctors [12,13] and those <lb/>in lower income countries [48], and scope creep of the budget was a <lb/>common occurrence for larger hospitals [10,52,54]. Therefore, a cost <lb/>analysis which encompasses infrastructure, personnel, maintenance and <lb/>ongoing optimization was critical [36,62]. Having a skilled workforce <lb/>in-house who understand the clinical workflows was also recommended <lb/>[53,61] as it can reduce dependence on and cost of vendors [12,36]. <lb/>However, this may not be feasible for smaller organizations, and larger <lb/>organizations also reportedly had issues with IT staff retention [10,13, <lb/>36,48,51]. Adequate time for end-user involvement and habituation to <lb/>the EHR was also vital [7,10,12] to ensure organizational readiness [7, <lb/>13,51,53]. <lb/>3.2.1.6. Workflows. Inability of the EHR system to meet the workflows <lb/>of end-users and organizations was commonly cited as negatively <lb/>impacting on success [7,10-12,36,37,51,52,54,56,62,63], including <lb/>end-user efficiency, productivity, satisfaction and acceptance of the EHR <lb/>[7,11,63]. Although replicating existing paper-based practices may <lb/>minimize disruptions for end-users [7,13,19,62], re-engineering of <lb/>workflows during digitization to make them safer and more efficient was <lb/>recommended [19,62,63]. <lb/>3.2.2. Human factors <lb/>Ability of healthcare organizations to successfully adopt an EHR <lb/>system was largely determined by the individual end-users [10,54], and <lb/>three overarching human factors were identified. <lb/>Table 3 (continued ) <lb/>Author <lb/>(Year) <lb/>Design <lb/>Focus <lb/>Setting/ <lb/>participants <lb/>Studies <lb/>Inclusion <lb/>criteria <lb/>Identified factors <lb/>interest in <lb/>computers <lb/>ecosystem <lb/>Privacy and <lb/>confidentiality <lb/>concerns <lb/>Note: EHR, Electronic health record; LTC, long-term care; HIT, Health Information Technology; OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; <lb/>EFTA, European Free Trade Association; HCPs, Health and Social Care Professionals. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2.2.1. Skills and characteristics. IT skills as well as personal charac-<lb/>teristics of individuals impacted on the success of an EHR implementa-<lb/>tion [10,12,50,51,53,56,58,60,62,13,19,36,37,44,47-49]. Assessing <lb/>computer literacy of end-users enabled provision of basic computer <lb/>training to those requiring it, prior to effective EHR training [36,48]. <lb/>Whilst the research assessing the impact of age, gender and clinical <lb/>experience on acceptance of the EHR reported in the identified reviews <lb/>was inconclusive, personal traits such as being open-to-change and a <lb/>problem-solver appeared to contribute to success [56,62]. However, <lb/>resistance to embracing the EHR could also be attributed to unusable <lb/>technology [10,51]. <lb/>3.2.2.2. Perceived benefits and incentives. Where individual end-users <lb/>perceived the EHR to positively impact on patient care and workload, <lb/>this reportedly facilitated a successful implementation [10,12,50,51,56, <lb/>58,60,13,19,36,37,44,47-49]. However, realistic benefits and time-<lb/>frames specific to the organization should be communicated with <lb/>end-users [44,45,62]. Monetary incentives or penalties have also been <lb/>shown to be important, especially for privately-governed organizations <lb/>[13,45,59]. <lb/>3.2.2.3. Perceived changes to the healthcare ecosystem. End-users&apos; con-<lb/>cerns with changes to data privacy and security, patient-clinician re-<lb/>lationships and their roles and responsibilities, appeared to negatively <lb/>impact on EHR implementations [7,10,51,53,56,58,60-62,12,13,19,36, <lb/>44,47-49]. These concerns may differ depending on the specific setting <lb/>and type of sensitive personal information being collected (e.g., mental <lb/>health) [47]. Therefore, specific concerns and their causes of concerns <lb/>should be identified and addressed as soon as possible to mitigate their <lb/>impact on EHR implementations [19,36]. <lb/>3.2.3. Technological factors <lb/>Six factors relating to the technology aspect of the EHR imple-<lb/>mentation were identified as critical to its success and were intrinsically <lb/>linked to the organizational and human factors. <lb/>3.2.3.1. Usability. EHR usability was deemed important across several <lb/>reviews [7,10,11,13,36,37,44,46,47,49,51,52,54,58,60,62], as it <lb/>impacted on end-user efficiency, patient-facing time [12,13,37,53], <lb/>quality of care [12], patient-clinician relationships [52] and safety [37]. <lb/>However, a simple and intuitive system in one setting may not be <lb/>transferrable to another, and therefore, end-user involvement in devel-<lb/>opment, design [10,37,62] and usability testing were recommended at <lb/>each site [37]. Additionally, enabling personalization of the EHR <lb/>interface [53] and access to legacy paper-based records [50,51] as well <lb/>as consideration of data quality and accuracy [13,44,51] with use of <lb/>health terminologies and classifications [56] was recommended. How-<lb/>ever, usability needs to be balanced with security [44]. <lb/>3.2.3.2. Interoperability. To enable health information exchange both <lb/>within and across healthcare organizations, interoperability was iden-<lb/>tified as critical [7,10-13,19,37,44,45,49-52,54,58,60,62]. Local <lb/>contextual factors within countries such as two tier and fully private <lb/>health systems, lack of employment of national standards [45,53,62], <lb/>inconsistent data capture in incompatible formats [12], have rendered <lb/>the creation of a fully interoperable EHR as difficult. Therefore, tech-<lb/>nical standards and communication between organizations were rec-<lb/>ommended to ensure interoperability was built in from the outset <lb/>including for legacy and existing health IT systems [7]. <lb/>3.2.3.3. Infrastructure. Procurement or enhancement of infrastructure, <lb/>including software (e.g., EHR, anti-viral), hardware (e.g., data-entry <lb/>devices, Wi-Fi, power outlets) and furniture, accounted for a large pro-<lb/>portion of the financial resourcing and were deemed critical for the <lb/>success of the overall EHR implementation [10,12,56,62,63,36,47-53]. <lb/>The existing and new hardware and software must be compatible with <lb/>the specific EHR product 45 , reliable and functional [13,36,44,53,56], <lb/>and enable sufficient accessibility to the EHR for end-users [36,45,52, <lb/>56]. According to the expert panel and additional literature reviewed, <lb/>selection of mobile and stationary data-entry devices also require <lb/>consideration of vendor certification, healthcare setting (e.g., out-<lb/>patients versus isolation rooms), required functions and workflows (e.g., <lb/>checklists versus long narrative notes), and end-user preferences for <lb/>usability. <lb/>3.2.3.4. Regulation, standards and policies. As stated earlier, national <lb/>and international standards as well as regulation and policies were <lb/>critical for interoperability and addressing privacy and security concerns <lb/>[7,13,19,45,46,51,52,56,58,60,62,63]. Therefore, messaging and lan-<lb/>guage standards [45,52,56], as well as robust privacy laws and policies <lb/>[13,44,52,56,62] were recommended. Where healthcare organizations <lb/>were permitted to procure their own EHR product, these standards <lb/>would likely be especially important. <lb/>3.2.3.5. Adaptability. Many of the literature reviews reported that <lb/>adaptability of the software was important to facilitate customization of <lb/>the EHR software to meet the needs of the end-users and organizations <lb/>[10,36,37,50,51,53,54,62]. This reportedly required the software ven-<lb/>dors to be open to sharing code development data and willing to adapt <lb/>their product [36,37,53], and the organization to have access to a skilled <lb/>workforce with the capabilities to adapt the EHR to clinical workflows <lb/>[37]. Where interoperability standards exist, the need for adaptations to <lb/>the software may be reduced [37]. <lb/>3.2.3.6. Testing. Comprehensive testing of the system was critical to <lb/>ensure usability and safety [7,10,37,54], and was more commonly cited <lb/>as important by IT staff and management than by HCPs [7]. This <lb/>rigorous, resource-intensive, multi-step testing process of each EHR <lb/>function needed to be conducted within live environments with actual <lb/>end-users [54] and should not be underestimated. <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>This umbrella review distilled the large volume of evidence available <lb/>regarding the successful implementation of a national EHR and these <lb/>findings were corroborated by an expert panel as being relevant to the <lb/>Irish healthcare context. Fifteen key organizational, human and tech-<lb/>nological factors were identified as critical and by synthesizing the <lb/>findings from several stakeholder groups and clinical settings, such as <lb/>doctors in primary or secondary care [11,13,45,53,58,61] and nurses in <lb/>a mental health setting [47], this review of reviews identified that each <lb/>of these factors were also relevant and important to EHR and other HIT <lb/>implementations across different healthcare contexts. <lb/>However, between country differences including health service <lb/>management, politics, economics, regulation and socio-culture impact <lb/>on how the identified factors influence success. This was evident in the <lb/>literature reviews which largely focused on studies conducted in the <lb/>predominantly private health service in the USA where return on in-<lb/>vestment and productivity were perceived benefits and incentives of <lb/>EHRs or EMRs [50,51,56]. Additionally whilst the governance approach <lb/>was identified as important, a successful approach in one country cannot <lb/>necessarily be replicated in another, as occurred in the UK where the <lb/>top-down approach successfully employed in the Netherlands resulted in <lb/>disengaged healthcare organizations across the UK [22]. Therefore, <lb/>these factors need to be employed with consideration of the national <lb/>context and in the Republic of Ireland this will also require close <lb/>collaboration and communication across the co-existing public and <lb/>private health sectors [64,65], as well as with those in Northern Ireland <lb/>(UK). Additionally, European Union (EU) citizens may avail of health-<lb/>care from any member state under the Cross-Border Healthcare <lb/></body>

			<body>Directive (2011/24/EU) and thus, efficient exchange of health data <lb/>across borders is a major priority [66] and is a pillar of EU4Health <lb/>2021-2027 [67]. Therefore, the EU interoperability policies and <lb/>frameworks [14] as well as standards such as the International Patient <lb/>Summary, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and stand-<lb/>ardised terminologies [4] to support these frameworks need to be <lb/>employed. <lb/>Despite the expansion in internationally-recognised standards (e. <lb/>g., HL7 FHIR) and significant regulatory and financial incentives <lb/>created by the HITECH Act and &quot;Meaningful Use&quot; requirements in the <lb/>USA, factors such as Usability and Regulations, standards and policies <lb/>continue to be highlighted as important for success as opposed to <lb/>being assumed components of EHR products. Whilst the inclusion of <lb/>older studies by these reviews perhaps contributed to this, it is also <lb/>likely that standards and requirements alone will not ensure an <lb/>interoperable and usable EHR. In fact, it is the dynamic interaction <lb/>between each of the identified factors which promotes a successful <lb/>EHR [68]. However, placing more emphasis on an individual factor <lb/>can reduce the resources required for others. For example, promoting <lb/>Usability and Standards can respectively reduce the burden of training <lb/>and support, as well as adaptability [37]. Additionally, this may be <lb/>achieved by advances in evidence and technology such as artificial <lb/>intelligence (AI) including automated testing [69], eLearning mod-<lb/>ules [70,71], and personalization of the EHR interface [72]. There-<lb/>fore, it is recommended that those involved in each aspect of the <lb/>implementation process communicate throughout it and review the <lb/>latest evidence regarding technology including peer-reviewed publi-<lb/>cations and white papers. <lb/>At a more local or meso level, the size of the organization, infra-<lb/>structure, organizational readiness and culture, capabilities and be-<lb/>liefs of the workforce, and available finance [36,37], were also <lb/>identified as important when considering the application of the <lb/>identified factors. Certain aspects of the internal context can also be <lb/>enhanced to improve the likelihood of EHR success such as employing <lb/>change management to create a clear and realistic vision of the EHR <lb/>[73] and providing basic computer training [36,48]. However, the <lb/>size of the organization and its workforce will likely remain more <lb/>limited compared to their larger counterparts [10,37]. Therefore, <lb/>sharing of resources such as champions, support staff and trainers <lb/>between larger and smaller hospitals or primary care settings has <lb/>been recommended, with some countries creating networks or <lb/>encouraging collaboration between existing regional groups of <lb/>healthcare organizations [73,74]. <lb/>4.1. Strengths and Limitations <lb/>Undertaking a rapid qualitative evidence synthesis requires accel-<lb/>eration of many of the research processes, is dependent on the reporting <lb/>in the original reviews [32] and could risk losing the context and <lb/>complexity of the original research setting [32,42,75]. Additionally, five <lb/>of the literature reviews were conducted by the same lead author which <lb/>could lead to bias of individual study inclusion. However, the inclusion <lb/>of literature reviews, consideration of the inclusion criteria of each <lb/>literature review and ongoing collaboration with an expert panel [30], <lb/>provided a degree of confidence regarding the coherence, relevance and <lb/>adequacy of the findings and their generalisability across healthcare <lb/>settings [76]. Additionally, actively involving knowledge-users who <lb/>were undertaking HIT implementations led to the concurrent translation <lb/>of this knowledge into practice [77]. <lb/>5. Conclusion <lb/>The key organizational, human and technological factors identified <lb/>in this review provide policy-makers and other key stakeholders with a <lb/>foundation for making evidence-based decisions during the imple-<lb/>mentation of a fully interoperable EHR across primary, secondary and <lb/>long-term care. However, consideration of the specific contextual in-<lb/>fluences is critical to the successful application of these factors. Addi-<lb/>tionally, the end-users, existing technological standards and policies, <lb/>and advances in technology and research in the area, will impact on how <lb/>these factors dynamically interact during the EHR implementation and <lb/>will influence success. <lb/></body>
