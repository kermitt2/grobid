			<front>S O F T W A R E <lb/>Open Access <lb/>Simulate_PCR for amplicon prediction and <lb/>annotation from multiplex, degenerate primers <lb/>and probes <lb/>Shea N Gardner * and Tom Slezak <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: Pairing up primers to amplify desired targets and avoid undesired cross reactions can be a <lb/>combinatorial challenge. Effective prediction of specificity and inclusivity from multiplexed primers and TaqMan®/ <lb/>Luminex® probes is a critical step in PCR design. <lb/>Results: Code is described to identify all primer and probe combinations from a list of unpaired, unordered <lb/>candidates that should produce a product. It predicts and extracts all amplicon sequences in a large sequence <lb/>database from a list of primers and probes, allowing degenerate bases and user-specified levels of primer-target <lb/>mismatch tolerance. Amplicons hit by TaqMan®/Luminex® probes are indicated, and products may be annotated <lb/>with gene information from NCBI. Fragment length distributions are calculated to predict electrophoretic gel <lb/>banding patterns. <lb/>Conclusions: Simulate_PCR is the only freely available software that can be run from the command line for high <lb/>throughput applications which can calculate all products from large lists of primers and probes compared to a <lb/>large sequence database such as nt. It requires no prior knowledge of how primers should be paired. Degenerate <lb/>bases are allowed and entire amplicon sequences are extracted and annotated with gene information. Examples <lb/>are provided for sets of TaqMan®/Luminex® PCR signatures predicted to amplify all HIV-1 genomes, all Coronaviridae <lb/>genomes, and a group of antibiotic resistance genes. The software is a command line perl script freely available as <lb/>open source. <lb/>Keywords: PCR target prediction software, HIV 1, Coronaviridae, Multiplex PCR, Amplicon prediction, Degenerate <lb/>PCR, Consensus PCR <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>PCR-based methods of detection and amplification re-<lb/>quire that primers be target-specific. PCR is used in <lb/>single-or multiplexed molecular diagnostics [1,2], consen-<lb/>sus PCR, and target enrichment prior to sequencing [3] <lb/>with, for example, Ion AmpliSeq™ (Life Technologies) [4], <lb/>TruSeq Amplicon (Illumina), and Haloplex (Agilent) [5]. <lb/>To predict desired reactions with target and undesired <lb/>cross reactions, simulate_PCR software is described to cal-<lb/>culate the possible primer pairings and products of PCR <lb/>(primer only) or primer + probe triplet reactions (as in <lb/>TaqMan® or Luminex®) in either single-plex or complex <lb/>multiplex reactions, as compared to a large sequence <lb/>database. We use it daily for applications in molecular <lb/>diagnostic signature development and erosion analysis (i.e. <lb/>checking robustness of PCR-based signatures in the face <lb/>of new sequence data), and have used it in the process of <lb/>developing primer panels with more than 1000 primers <lb/>for target enrichment prior to sequencing. <lb/>Simulate_PCR is the only software that 1) finds all <lb/>possible primer pairings predicted to result in a product <lb/>from an unordered, unpaired list of primer and probe <lb/>candidates, 2) can be run from the linux command line <lb/>for high throughput applications, 3) can calculate prod-<lb/>ucts from multiplexed combinations of many primers, 4) <lb/>predict probes binding to those amplicons, 5) allows de-<lb/>generate bases, 6) extracts entire amplicon sequences <lb/>and creates a FASTA file of amplicons for downstream <lb/></body>

			<body>analyses, and 7) automatically annotates amplicons with <lb/>gene information downloaded from NCBI&apos;s Genbank for <lb/>those matches with a gi number. <lb/>Other tools to simulate PCR exist, like NCBI Primer-<lb/>BLAST [6], FastPCR [7], and csPCR [8]. They are excellent <lb/>for low throughput analyses where manual inspection and <lb/>a graphical user interface (GUI) is desired, and they offer a <lb/>number of very useful features not offered by simula-<lb/>te_PCR, such as primer design, and primer T m , secondary <lb/>structure and primer-dimer prediction. However, when <lb/>the goal is prediction of target and off-target amplification <lb/>and probe binding as part of an automated pipeline, with <lb/>optional amplicon sequence extraction and gene annota-<lb/>tion, simulate_PCR provides a unique capability. For ex-<lb/>ample, if a long list of primer candidates has been <lb/>designed with desired thermodynamic or taxonomically <lb/>specific characteristics, it can be a chore to identify the <lb/>best pairings if one has to check all possible pairwise com-<lb/>binations using a tool that considers only one single-plex <lb/>primer pair at a time to predict products, as with the web <lb/>tool Primer-BLAST. Another tool, FastPCR claims multi-<lb/>plex capabilities, but unfortunately this capability only ap-<lb/>plies to primer design (e.g. avoiding primer dimers) but <lb/>not to amplicon prediction from mixtures of more than 2 <lb/>primers in the same reaction. Moreover, it is not freely <lb/>available except as a trial version for Windows and it must <lb/>be run from a GUI, making it unfeasible for large scale <lb/>unix/linux applications. The csPCR program does predict <lb/>amplicons from multiplexed primers, but it must be run <lb/>from a GUI, suitable for one-off analyses by non-<lb/>programmers, but presenting a problem for high through-<lb/>put automated pipelines. MFEprimer2.0 has a command <lb/>line version and can take a batch of primers with unspeci-<lb/>fied pairings, but requires a large amount of memory so <lb/>that most users will not have sufficient RAM to compare <lb/>to the NCBI nt database. When we tried several examples <lb/>on the MFEprimer2.0 website, which simulate_PCR ran in <lb/>a few seconds, they never finished after several hours, al-<lb/>though this could also have been a web server issue on the <lb/>days we tried. In summary, none of the currently available <lb/>PCR target prediction tools have the capability to consider <lb/>primer + probe triplet reactions, none extract entire <lb/>amplicon sequences, instead reporting only the positions <lb/>of primer matches, none annotate gene information that <lb/>overlaps the amplicons, none handle large numbers of un-<lb/>paired, multiplex, degenerate primers compared to large <lb/>sequence databases, and most cannot be run as part of an <lb/>automated pipeline without a GUI or web interface. Thus, <lb/>simulate_PCR addresses an unmet need to aid in the de-<lb/>sign and assessment of PCR-based molecular diagnostic <lb/>signatures. <lb/>Simulate_PCR is an open source, command line Perl <lb/>script that calls the BLAST [9] programs makeblastdb, <lb/>blastn, and blastdbcmd, and the NCBI efetch utility <lb/>(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25498/#chapter3. <lb/>ESearch__ESummaryEFetch). It can be run after multiplex <lb/>degenerate primer and probe design using software such as <lb/>PriMux [10], which automatically creates a FASTA file of <lb/>primers and probes formatted as input for simulate_PCR. <lb/>Implementation <lb/>Approach <lb/>The script simulate_PCR predicts PCR amplicons from a <lb/>sequence database given primers and, optionally, probes. <lb/>Multiplex degenerate primers encoded with IUPAC char-<lb/>acters are BLASTed against sequences in the database, <lb/>and amplicons calculated from primer-database sequence <lb/>matches with no more than the allowable number of <lb/>mismatches that are in the correct orientation and <lb/>distance. If the input file contains probes, indicated <lb/>with &quot;|IO&quot; (Internal Oligo) at the end of the FASTA <lb/>defline, probe matches are reported within the amplicons. <lb/>If the option -extract_amp is set to 1, then amplicon <lb/>sequences are extracted with blastdbcmd. <lb/>Any non-matching BLAST position is a mismatch, in-<lb/>cluding SNPs, indels, and degenerate bases. These break <lb/>up blastn search seeds, so more sensitive detection can <lb/>result from including all primer/probe variants instead <lb/>of degenerates. Another way to trade sensitivity for <lb/>speed is by setting the maximum number of blast hits to <lb/>report per primer with the option -max_target_seqs. <lb/>This should be as least twice as high as the expected <lb/>number of sequences targeted, and can be much higher <lb/>if signature components are highly conserved. The third <lb/>way to alter sensitivity is to modify the -word_size op-<lb/>tion. Default is 4, the minimum allowable BLAST seed <lb/>size, so this value can only be increased for faster speed. <lb/>By setting the simulate_PCR -mux option to 0 the <lb/>code predicts specific forward-reverse primer pairings as <lb/>a singleplex PCR or primer/probe triplet reaction. Set-<lb/>ting -mux 1 predicts amplicons from any combination <lb/>of primers and probes, as illustrated in Figure 1. <lb/>With the option -genes 1, if any sequences have gi <lb/>numbers, annotations which overlap predicted ampli-<lb/>cons are automatically downloaded from NCBI Genbank <lb/>with the efetch utility. Annotations reported are primary <lb/>tag, product, gene, note, and protein id, for coding se-<lb/>quences (CDS), genes, mRNA, mature peptides, miscel-<lb/>laneous features, etc. <lb/>Inputs are a file of primers and probes and a file of se-<lb/>quences (either FASTA or BLAST database) to be checked <lb/>for amplicons. Additional command line parameters are <lb/>minimum and maximum reportable amplicon lengths, the <lb/>maximum number of mismatches allowed per primer or <lb/>probe compared to a database hit, whether to report gene <lb/>annotations, whether to run as single-or multiplex, <lb/>whether to extract amplicon sequences, the number of <lb/>blastn threads, the maximum number of BLAST hits to <lb/></body>

The &quot;amplicon_distribution&quot; file sum-<lb/>marizes fragment length distributions for each target, <lb/>useful to predict electrophoretic gel banding patterns. <lb/>A FASTA file contains the predicted amplicons, <lb/>which will be empty if -extract_amp option is 0. The <lb/>&quot;detection_counts_by_triplet.#mismatches&quot; files list all <lb/>forward/reverse primer pairs and probe triplets with the <lb/>number of sequences in the database each is predicted to <lb/>detect. These detection counts are calculated assuming <lb/>0 mismatches between primers/probes and the database <lb/>sequence, or up to 1 mismatch per primer or probe, <lb/>etc. up to the maximum number of mismatches <lb/>specified in the input -mm option. Results from each <lb/>mismatch count are shown in separate files. The file <lb/>&quot;one_primer_but_no_amp&quot; lists the database sequences <lb/>for which one primer matched without a paired pri-<lb/>mer within the allowable amplicon length. There is a <lb/>README and an example at https://sourceforge.net/ <lb/>projects/simulatepcr/files/. <lb/>Computational examples <lb/>Primer and probes were predicted for 3 target sets: 1) <lb/>547 Coronaviridae genomes; 2) 1809 HIV-1 genomes; 3) <lb/>9 antibiotic resistance gene sequences (Table 1). 1) and <lb/>2) were the set of all available genomes downloaded <lb/>from Genbank on August 5, 2013, and 3) was several of <lb/>the first sequences listed in a download of the genes <lb/>from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance data-<lb/>base [11] plus an ndm-1 antibiotic resistance gene <lb/>sequence from NCBI.

			<body>1000 for Coronaviridae and antibiotic resistance genes <lb/>or -max_target_seqs 10,000 for HIV. Primers were <lb/>compared against original genomes to assess target <lb/>inclusivity and against the NCBI nt database (from <lb/>December 2013) for off-target reactions. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Results are summarized in Table 2 and available from <lb/>https://sourceforge.net/projects/simulatepcr/files/. For HIV1, <lb/>the 14 degenerate primers are predicted to amplify all tar-<lb/>gets in the original FASTA file with various combinations of <lb/>forward and reverse primer pairings. Simulate_PCR pre-<lb/>dicted over 12,000 unique sequences amplified from nt from <lb/>the combined set of primers and probes. All of the database <lb/>sequences amplified are HIV except some synthetic <lb/>constructs and vectors and 3 SIV sequences: gi|402243571 <lb/>isolate LB715, gi|387119180 clone SIVcpzMB897.c2, and gi| <lb/>387119170 clone SIVcpzEK505.c2. Each of these SIV <lb/>sequences had mismatches to the probe, so should not be <lb/>detected by a TaqMan with stringent conditions <lb/>that exclude hybridization with mismatches. Two of the SIV <lb/>sequences had human-specific adaptations in gag [12], so <lb/>these signatures may be specific for HIV or human adapted <lb/>SIV. The ranked list of triplets from the nt database shows <lb/>that the combination 1|F, 2|R, 78|IO is predicted to detect <lb/>5939 unique database sequences with 0 mismatches be-<lb/>tween the triplet components and the sequence. In total, <lb/>there are 258,604 predicted PCR products. <lb/>There were ~39,000 sequences with one primer match <lb/>but no paired primer within the reportable length range. <lb/>A single 18-24-mer with up to 3 mismatches is likely to <lb/>match many sequences. The PCR specificity stems from <lb/>the requirement for 2 matches within priming distance <lb/>and orientation. However, one cannot always count on <lb/>primer pairing specificity, making it essential to check for <lb/>unanticipated primer pairing combinations in a multiplex <lb/>that could amplify undesired non-target sequences. <lb/>For Coronaviridae primers, one amplicon from a <lb/>glaucous-winged gull was predicted if a single mismatch <lb/>in the forward primer was allowed, although there were <lb/>no matching probes. This was the only predicted ampli-<lb/>con from nt outside Coronaviridae, besides synthetic <lb/>RNA transcription vectors derived from coronaviruses <lb/>(feline coronavirus and murine hepatitis virus vectors <lb/>pBRDI1 and pBRDI2). The run took just over a minute <lb/>against the Coronaviridae genomes database, 4.5 hrs or <lb/>3.5 hrs against nt with or without amplicon extraction <lb/>and gene annotation, respectively. <lb/>There were 14 primers and 6 probes for the 9 antibiotic <lb/>resistance genes. Simulate_PCR compared to the original <lb/>target sequences finished in 8 seconds. Comparing to nt re-<lb/>quired 47 minutes or 55 minutes, excluding or including <lb/>the steps to extract amplicons and annotate genes, respect-<lb/>ively. Predictions indicate that the primers and probes <lb/>should amplify 1573 sequences (Additional file 1: Table S1), <lb/>including (in addition to those organisms in Table 1), <lb/>Achromobacter denitrificans, Enterobacter cloacae, Myco-<lb/>bacterium bovis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter <lb/>freundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia <lb/>pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, various vectors, plasmids, <lb/>and uncultured bacteria, and many others. <lb/>Table 1 Antibiotic resistance target genes <lb/>Source organism <lb/>Gene <lb/>Klebsiella pneumoniae <lb/>Sul1 <lb/>Bacteroides fragilis <lb/>tetX <lb/>Azoarcus sp.

			<body>Conclusions <lb/>A simple script called simulate_PCR is described to <lb/>identify combinations of primer pairs and primer/probe <lb/>triplets that detect database sequences, rank the pairs <lb/>and triplets by the number of sequences they detect, ex-<lb/>tract amplicon sequences and gene annotations, and pre-<lb/>dict fragment length distributions from the multiplex. <lb/>Degenerate bases are allowed, as are a user-specified <lb/>number of mismatches between triplet components and <lb/>database sequences. The tool allows a user to specify de-<lb/>sired primer pairings, or with the &quot;mux&quot; setting it checks <lb/>all combinations of primers and probes. This enables a <lb/>user to input an unordered, unpaired list of candidate <lb/>forward and reverse primers and probes and let the re-<lb/>sults guide which pairings achieve the desired specificity. <lb/>Simulate_PCR is a command line script, so can be run <lb/>as part of a pipeline where a GUI is not suitable. Our <lb/>group has used this tool to predict products from multi-<lb/>plexed sets with thousands of primers compared against <lb/>large sequence databases of all available whole finished <lb/>and draft microbial genomes (75 GB) and against nt. <lb/>Extracting a FASTA file of the amplicon sequences is <lb/>convenient when analyzing high throughput sequencing <lb/>data that has undergone target enrichment. For example, <lb/>running simulate_PCR on an AmpliSeq™ primer pool <lb/>with thousands of primers provides an ideal FASTA <lb/>database for read mapping the resulting sequence data. <lb/>Some changes to alter the sensitivity/speed tradeoff of <lb/>simulate_PCR could include swapping out blastn with a <lb/>short read mapper to improve speed, or with more sen-<lb/>sitive alignment such as FASTA [13] or Smith-<lb/>Waterman, at the cost of slower speed. Using a k-mer <lb/>index algorithm to find primer binding sites could im-<lb/>prove speed and sensitivity, but requires large amounts <lb/>of RAM for large sequence databases. This is the tech-<lb/>nique used by MFEprimer, which requires 12 GB RAM <lb/>for a 3 GB human genome database [14], implying that <lb/>larger databases like nt or a 75 GB microbial genome <lb/>database would not be feasible with the RAM available <lb/>to most users. However, we have tuned the default blastn <lb/>parameters in simulate_PCR to maximize sensitivity, <lb/>and found that with the threaded option it performs very <lb/>fast for situations with up to several thousand primers <lb/>and probes. Command line options can be adjusted to <lb/>balance tradeoffs of sensitivity versus speed. BLAST heu-<lb/>ristics may fail to report all matches to short oligos if de-<lb/>generate bases break matches below the word length of 4, <lb/>which is only a problem with large numbers of degenerate <lb/>or mismatching bases. In this case, one could replace de-<lb/>generate primers with the expanded variant combinations <lb/>to improve sensitivity at the expense of speed. <lb/>The optional steps of amplicon extraction (blastdbcmd) <lb/>and gene annotation of amplicons (efetch) can be time-<lb/>intensive, and it is recommended that they be omitted if <lb/>one expects results with more than 10,000 amplicons. The <lb/>advantage of blastdbcmd is that it allows one to extract <lb/>amplicon sequences from a precompiled blast database <lb/>(e.g. nt) without the extremely large FASTA input file <lb/>from which the BLAST database was created. The original <lb/>FASTA data may not even be available if only the precom-<lb/>piled nt blast database was downloaded from NCBI. <lb/>In summary, a command line Perl script was devel-<lb/>oped to predict products from single-or multiplex de-<lb/>generate PCR or TaqMan®/Luminex® reactions compared <lb/>against large sequence databases. Simulate_PCR is useful <lb/>to select primer pairings and probe combinations, check <lb/>for desired target amplification and non-target cross-<lb/>reactions against databases tens of GB in size, rank pairs <lb/>and triplets by the number of sequences they are pre-<lb/>dicted to detect, predict fragment length distributions <lb/>from a multiplex, extract amplicon sequences, and anno-<lb/>tate genes overlapping them. We use this code daily to <lb/>predict the specificity and target inclusivity of molecular <lb/>diagnostic signatures and multiplexes for target enrich-<lb/>ment prior to sequencing. <lb/></body>
