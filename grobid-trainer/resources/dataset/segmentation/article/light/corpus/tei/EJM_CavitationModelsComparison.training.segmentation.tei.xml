			()  t <lb/> turbulent <lb/> 1. Introduction <lb/> Cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities within a given liquid due to <lb/>pressure drop. It may be observed in various engineering systems such as <lb/>hydraulic constructions, aeronautics, aerospace, power systems and turbo-<lb/>machinery. The cavitation development may be the origin of several nega-<lb/>tive eAEects, such as noise, vibrations, performance alterations, erosion and <lb/>structural damages. This makes cavitation an important issue in design and <lb/>operation, which should be controlled, or at least well understood. <lb/>Among the cavitation types that may develop, partial cavitation pockets <lb/>are often observed in hydraulic machines and is known to be responsible for <lb/>severe damage. Cavitating venturis are one of the simplest case to study <lb/>such cavities, both experimentally and numerically. This kind of cavitation <lb/>is characterized by a partial vapour cavity that detaches from the solid body <lb/>and extends downstream with the existence of a re-entrant jet. The dynamic <lb/>of these cavitation sheets, the interaction between cavitation and turbulence, <lb/>the behaviour of the turbulent boundary layer are not yet well known and <lb/>understood. <lb/>Although the numerical modelling of such cavitation has received a great <lb/>deal of attention, it is still a very di±cult and challenging task to simulate <lb/>such complex unsteady two-phase flow with an acceptable accuracy. Cavitat-<lb/>ing flows are challenging to model, since they are turbulent with a complex <lb/>

			interaction with two-phase structures, highly dynamic and involve non equi-<lb/>librium thermodynamic states. Several numerical models have been devel-<lb/>oped to investigate such cavitating flows, especially with one-fluid Reynolds-<lb/>Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The homogeneous mixture model <lb/>treats the cavitating flows as a mixture of two fluids behaving as one. These <lb/>models are based on the assumption of local kinematic equilibrium between <lb/>phases (the local velocity is the same for both phases), local thermal and <lb/>mechanic equilibrium between the two components (local temperature and <lb/>pressure equality between phases). These models are composed by three <lb/>conservation laws for mixture quantities (mass, momentum and total en-<lb/>ergy). This model cannot reproduce strong thermodynamic non equilibrium <lb/>eAEects but, because of its simplicity, it is often used for numerical simulations <lb/>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. <lb/>By assuming that one pure phase is on a metastable state, a supplementary <lb/>mass equation or void fraction equation is added. Various formulations of <lb/>four-equation model have been expressed. A very popular formulation has <lb/>been developed to simulate turbulent cavitating flows [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. <lb/>The main di±culty is related to the formulation of the source term and the <lb/>tunable parameters involved for the vaporization and condensation processes. <lb/>Moreover, these models are not thermodynamically well-posed [15]. Another <lb/>popular model devoted to ebullition problems uses a relaxation term (Ho-<lb/>mogeneous Relaxation Model). The source term involves a relaxation time <lb/>estimated from experimental data [16] or with an optimization problem on <lb/>the mixture entropy [17]. An original formulation was recently proposed for <lb/>the mass transfer between phases assuming its proportionality with the diver-<lb/>

			gence of the mixture velocity. This model was validated on various inviscid <lb/>and turbulent applications [18, 19]. <lb/>The present work is devoted to the numerical study of a partial cavitation <lb/>pocket appearing on a venturi geometry. For this test case, a transitional be-<lb/>haviour is observed between a stable pocket and a periodic cycles pocket. <lb/>A particular emphasis is placed on the comparison of various void ratio <lb/>transport equation models and their ability to capture the re-entrant jet <lb/>phenomenon. An in-house finite-volume code solving a four-equation RANS <lb/>compressible system was developed [19]. A new cavitation model is investi-<lb/>gated using a mixture of stiAEened gas equation of state (EOS). The formula-<lb/>tion does not involve any tunable parameter. Validation and comparisons are <lb/>done with experimental measurements (time-averaged void ratio and veloc-<lb/>ity profiles, RMS wall pressure fluctuations). A comparison is proposed with <lb/>OpenFOAM simulations in which the Kunz&apos;s void ratio transport equation <lb/>model is considered. The opensource software OpenFOAM was used and <lb/>validated in cavitating flows by various authors [20, 21, 22]. <lb/>In this paper, we will first review the theoretical formulation, including phys-<lb/>ical models, equation of state and elements of the numerical methods. This <lb/>is followed by sets of results on a Venturi geometry and discussions. <lb/> 2. The LEGI&apos;s numerical tool <lb/> The code is based on the solving of the one-fluid compressible RANS system <lb/>with transport-equation turbulence models. <lb/>

The <lb/>expression of the preconditioning matrix P  c  is given in [19]. k is the mixture <lb/>turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and ™ is a mixture turbulent variable. In <lb/>multiphase flow, the divergence of the fluctuating phase velocity is not zero <lb/>[23]. Therefore, supplementary terms appear in the mixture TKE equation <lb/>(pressure-dilation term, dilatational dissipation rate), which are not taken <lb/>into account in the present paper. <lb/>The exact expression of the eddy-viscosity µ  t  and the source terms depends <lb/>on the turbulence model as well as constants ae  k  and ae  ™  . <lb/>The total stress tensor ø is evaluated using the Stokes hypothesis, Newton&apos;s <lb/>

In the following, this model will be named <lb/>4-equation barotropic model. It involves one tunable parameter c  baro  inter-<lb/>preted as the minimum value of the speed of sound in the mixture.

This model will be named 4-equation SG model. <lb/>It does not involve any tunable parameter. <lb/> 2.4. The turbulence model <lb/> Various turbulence models are considered: the Smith k ° ` model (KL) [26], <lb/>the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model (SA) [27] and the Jones-Launder <lb/>

			 k ° &quot; model (KE) [28]. For a correct simulation of the re-entrant jet, the <lb/>Reboud eddy-viscosity limiter is added [29, 30, 31]. For comparisons with <lb/>the OpenFOAM solver, the Menter k ° ! SST model [32] is used, assuming <lb/>the validity of the Bradshaw assumption in a two-phase turbulent boundary <lb/>layer. <lb/> 2.5. Wall functions <lb/> For the modelling of flow close to the wall, a two-layer wall law approach is <lb/>used: <lb/> u  +  = y  + <lb/> if y  +  &lt; 11.13 <lb/> u  +  = <lb/>1 <lb/> ∑ <lb/> ln y  +  + 5.25 if y  +  &gt; 11.13 <lb/> u  +  = <lb/> u <lb/>U  ø <lb/> ; <lb/> y  +  = <lb/> yU  ø <lb/> ∫  w <lb/> ; U  2 <lb/> ø  = <lb/> ø  w <lb/> Ω  w <lb/> (19) <lb/>where ∑ = 0.41 is the von Karman constant and the subscript &apos;w&apos; is used for <lb/>a wall value. <lb/>We assume that wall functions are similar in a two-phase flow and in a <lb/>single-phase flow. For unsteady flows, the existence of a wall law is assumed <lb/>to be valid at each instant. These assumptions have been studied in [33] and <lb/>comparisons were proposed with a thin boundary layer approach. <lb/> 2.6. Numerics <lb/> The numerical simulations are carried out using an implicit CFD code based <lb/>on a finite-volume discretization. For the mean flow, the convective flux <lb/>density vector on a cell face is computed with the Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel <lb/>scheme [34]. The artificial viscosity includes a second-order dissipation term <lb/>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			 D  2  and a fourth-order dissipation term D  4  , which involve two tunable pa-<lb/>rameters k  (2)  and k  (4)  . <lb/>The viscous terms are discretized by a second-order space-centered scheme. <lb/>For the turbulence transport equations, the upwind Roe scheme [35] is used <lb/>to obtain a more robust method. The second-order accuracy is obtained by <lb/>introducing a flux-limited dissipation [36]. <lb/>Time integration is achieved using the dual time stepping approach and a <lb/>low-cost implicit method consisting in solving, at each time step, a system <lb/>of equations arising from the linearization of a fully implicit scheme. The <lb/>derivative with respect to the physical time is discretized by a second-order <lb/>formula. <lb/>The numerical treatment of boundary conditions is based on the use of the <lb/>preconditioned characteristic relationships. More details are given in [19]. <lb/> 3. The OpenFOAM code <lb/> The OpenFOAM code is an open source code distributed by ESI Group. It <lb/>is based on an orientated object framework [37]. It provides a large variety of <lb/>RANS turbulence models and cavitation models. For cavitation modelling, <lb/>two ways are available: either to use an equation of state for the mixture or <lb/>to use a transport equation for the volume fraction of liquid. The last one is <lb/>retained for the present simulation. <lb/> 3.1. Cavitation model <lb/> The cavitation model reads: <lb/> @AE  l <lb/> @t <lb/> + u  j <lb/> @AE  l <lb/> @x  j <lb/> = S <lb/> (20) <lb/>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			where AE  l  is the volume fraction of liquid and S is the mass source term. <lb/>Following Kunz development [10], the source term is expressed as the sum of <lb/>a vaporisation term m  v  and a condensation term m  c  : <lb/> S = m  v  + m  c <lb/> (21) <lb/>with: <lb/> m  c  = <lb/> Ω <lb/>Ω  l  Ω  v <lb/> C  c <lb/> Ω  v <lb/> t  1 <lb/> AE  2 <lb/> Llim <lb/> max (P ° P  vap  ; 0) <lb/>max (P ° P  vap  ; 0.01 P  vap  ) <lb/>(22) <lb/> m  v  = <lb/> Ω <lb/>Ω  l  Ω  v <lb/> C  v <lb/> Ω  v <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> Ω  l  U  2 <lb/> 1  t  1 <lb/> min (P ° P  vap  ; P  0  ) <lb/>( 2 3 ) <lb/> C  c  , C  v  , U  1  and t  1  are constant set by the user, whereas P  0  and AE  Llim  are <lb/>included to avoid non physical values. Usually U  1  is set to the freestream <lb/>value, and t  1  represents a relaxation time not well defined in the literature. <lb/>For the present computations, the following values are specified: <lb/> C  c  = 10 ; C  v  = 8000 ; U  1  = 10.8 m/s ; t  1  = 0.005 s <lb/> (24) <lb/>The model uncertainty should be analyzed using non-intrusive stochastic <lb/>methods as presented in [38]. <lb/> 3.2. The turbulence model <lb/> The k ° ! SST model proposed by Menter [32] is used to solve the turbulent <lb/>kinetic energy and the specific dissipation with the standard values of the <lb/>diAEerent parameters. <lb/> 3.3. Numerics <lb/> The time derivatives are computed with the backward second order scheme. <lb/>Excepted for the volume fraction of liquid, the convective flux are discretised <lb/>

			with the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme named &apos;limitedLinear&apos; <lb/>specific to OpenFOAM with the parameter set to 1. <lb/>Whereas the momentum equation and the Poisson equation are treated im-<lb/>plicitly, the equation for the volume fraction of liquid is treated explicitly and <lb/>separately. To maintain the boundedness of the liquid volume fraction, the <lb/>Multidimensional Universal Limiter for Explicit Solution (MULES) is used <lb/>and a counter-gradient is introduced to reduce the diAEusion of the interface <lb/>and enhanced the numerical stability. The convective flux of the transport <lb/>equation for the volume fraction of liquid is computed with the van Leer <lb/>scheme. <lb/>The set of equation is solved using a prediction-correction approach coupling <lb/>the SIMPLE and PISO algorithm. <lb/> 4. Experimental and numerical parameters <lb/> 4.1. Experimental conditions <lb/> The Venturi was tested in the cavitation tunnel of the CREMHyG (Centre <lb/>d&apos;Essais de Machines Hydrauliques de Grenoble). It is characterized by a <lb/>divergence angle of 4  ±  , illustrated in Figure 1. The edge forming the throat <lb/>of the Venturi is used to fix the separation point of the cavitation cavity. <lb/>This geometry is equipped with five probing holes to allow various mea-<lb/>surements such as the local void ratio, instantaneous local speed and wall <lb/>pressure (Figure 1). The velocity is evaluated as the most probable value <lb/>and the void ratio is obtained from the signal of the double optical probe <lb/>using a post-processing algorithm. The relative uncertainty on the void ratio <lb/>measurement was estimated at roughly 15% [39]. <lb/>

			The selected operating point is characterized by the following physical pa-<lb/>rameters [39]: <lb/> U  inlet  = 10.8 m/s, the inlet velocity <lb/> ae  inlet  = <lb/> P  inlet  ° P  vap <lb/> 0.5ΩU  2 <lb/> inlet <lb/> &apos; 0.55, the cavitation parameter in the inlet section <lb/> T  ref  &apos; 293K, the reference temperature <lb/> L  ref  =252 mm, the reference length <lb/> Re  L  ref  = <lb/> U  inlet  L  ref <lb/> ∫ <lb/> = 2.7 10  6  , the Reynolds number <lb/>With these parameters, a cavity length L ranging from 70 mm to 85 mm was <lb/>obtained. The experimental views for this geometry show a relatively stable <lb/>cavity behaviour (see Fig. 2). The attached cavity length corresponding to <lb/>the end of the re-entrant jet is around 30-35 mm. For this geometry, no <lb/>periodic cycles with large shedding were observed. <lb/> 4.2. Mesh and numerical parameters <lb/> The grid is a H-type topology. It contains 251 nodes in the flow direction <lb/>and 62 nodes in the orthogonal direction. A special contraction of the mesh <lb/>is applied in the main flow direction just after the throat to better simulate <lb/>the two-phase flow area. The y  +  values of the mesh, at the center of the first <lb/>cell, vary between 12 and 27 for a non cavitating computation. <lb/>Unsteady computations are performed with the dual time stepping method <lb/>and are started from the non cavitating numerical solution.

			- the CFL number, 0.2 <lb/>-Jacobi iterations for the implicit stage, 15 <lb/>-the two coe±cients of the artificial dissipation, k  (2)  = 1 and k  (4)  = 0.045. <lb/> 5. Computational results <lb/> Various computations were performed by varying the cavitation model and <lb/>the turbulence model, summarized in Table (1). The goal was to obtain a <lb/>sheet whose time-averaged attached and total length varied around 30-35 <lb/>mm and 75-85 mm, respectively. The time of simulation is between 2 and <lb/>3 s. <lb/> 5.1. Limitation of the eddy viscosity <lb/> A key point to compute the unsteadiness of the cavitation pocket is linked to <lb/>the over-production of eddy viscosity by standard turbulence models. Previ-<lb/>ous simulations based on a three-equation model illustrated the importance <lb/>of using an eddy-viscosity limiter to capture the re-entrant jet dynamics [30]. <lb/>In this study, the Reboud limiter is added to the turbulence model. The <lb/>eAEect of this limiter using the Spalart-Allmaras is showed in Figure 3 where <lb/>are plotted the contours of the density gradient modulus (Schlieren-like vi-<lb/>sualizations). When the turbulent viscosity is reduced by the correction, the <lb/>length of attached cavity reaches the experimental value around 0.35 m and <lb/>vapour clouds appear. <lb/>We observed the same eAEect for other turbulence models and results are not <lb/>presented. <lb/>

			5.2. Turbulence models comparison <lb/> Computations are done using the four-equation barotropic model associated <lb/>to three turbulence models in which the Reboud limiter is added. All nu-<lb/>merical values are obtained by a time-averaged statistical treatment over a <lb/>simulation time of 2 s. <lb/>Fig. 4 presents the void ratio and velocity profiles from stations 3 to 5. At <lb/>stations 1 and 2, inside the attached cavity, all simulations provide the same <lb/>results in close agreement with the experimental data and are not presented. <lb/>At station 3, the re-entrant jet is observed on the velocity measurement. All <lb/>simulations indicate a recirculating behaviour with a re-entrant jet extend-<lb/>ing through half the sheet thickness. For the void ratio profiles, the three <lb/>simulations give very close results. <lb/>At station 4 and 5 the whole of simulation capture the re-entrant jet charac-<lb/>terized by negative velocitites close to the wall. As regard to the void ratio <lb/>profiles, we observe an over-estimation at station 4 using the k ° ¡ models <lb/>and a better estimation using the Spalart-Allmaras model. At station 5, the <lb/> k ° ` turbulence model overestimates a little the length of the cavity. <lb/>The dimensionless wall pressure distribution  P °P  vap <lb/> Pvap <lb/> is plotted in Figure 5 <lb/>versus the distance x ° x  inlet  . The first five data are located inside the cavity <lb/>(where the void ratio and velocity profiles are measured). All models provide <lb/>a pressure distribution similar to the experimental measurements upstream <lb/>of the re-compression. <lb/>

Experimental data indicate an augmenta-<lb/>tion of pressure fluctuations at the end of the sheet cavity. All simulations <lb/>predict a peak of pressure fluctuations located close to the experimental ab-<lb/>scissa. The magnitude of the peak is overestimated by the computations, <lb/>but with the lack of experimental values in this area the comparison cannot <lb/>be precise. Nevertheless, downstream the cavity, the pressure fluctuations <lb/>are over-predicted using the Spalart-Allmaras and k ° &quot; turbulence models. <lb/>This phenomenon has already been observed in a previous study and can be <lb/>corrected by modifying the source term in the void ratio equation [19]. <lb/>The dynamic of cavitation pocket is also studied with the iso-lines of the Q-<lb/>criterion. Positive values of the Q-criterion, defined as the second invariant <lb/>of the velocity gradient tensor  @u  i <lb/> @x  j <lb/> [40], <lb/> Q = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> &quot; µ @u  i <lb/> @x  i <lb/> ∂  2 <lb/> ° <lb/> @u  i <lb/> @x  j <lb/> @u  j <lb/> @x  i <lb/> # <lb/> (25) <lb/>are used to identify vortices and local rotational areas. A dimensionless quan-<lb/>tity is built using the inlet velocity and the reference length. Iso-lines levels <lb/>vary between 0.005 and 0.1. The results are illustrated in Figure 7. For <lb/>all turbulence models, the shear layer creates vortical clouds of cavitation, <lb/>which are convected by the mean flow. No significant discrepancies on the <lb/>flow dynamic are noticeable between the three simulations. <lb/>To conclude, similar results have been obtained with the three turbulence <lb/>

			models associated to an eddy viscosity limiter. The re-entrant jet is well <lb/>estimated but vapour ratio tends to be overestimated especially in the re-<lb/>circulating area (station 3 and 4). The influence of the turbulence model is <lb/>weak for this partial cavitation pocket. <lb/>In the next part, a mixture of stiAEened gas EOS is proposed to replace the <lb/>barotropic EOS and to investigate the cavitation model influence. <lb/> 5.3. Cavitation models comparison <lb/> For this study, the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is chosen and the two <lb/>formulations of 4-equation model are compared. <lb/>The dynamic of the cavitation sheets is proposed in Figure 8 where the con-<lb/>tours of the density gradient modulus are presented at two diAEerent times. <lb/>Both simulations propose similar dynamics and the generation of vapour <lb/>cloud shedding are clearly illustrated. <lb/>A more precise comparison is led by studying void ratio and velocity profiles, <lb/>which are presented in Figure 9 from stations 3 to 5. At region of attached <lb/>cavity sheet (stations 1 and 2), both simulations provide a well estimation of <lb/>the cavity thickness and results are not presented. <lb/>DiAEerences appear at station 3 where the four-equation SG cavitation model <lb/>provides a better prediction of the void ratio profile characterized by a sig-<lb/>nificant decrease close to the wall. However, by comparison with the exper-<lb/>imental data and the four-equation barotropic velocity profiles, this model <lb/>underestimates the recirculating flow in this area. At stations 4 and 5 the <lb/>four-equation SG cavitation model also reproduces the re-entrant jet on the <lb/>

			half bottom of the cavity but it over-predicts the vapour ratio in the remain-<lb/>ing part. The wall value of the void ratio is better simulated with the new <lb/>model. <lb/>As it can be observed in Figure 10 both models give a time-averaged wall <lb/>pressure distribution in good agreement with the experimental data. The <lb/>Root Mean Square (RMS) wall pressure fluctuations are plotted in Figure 11. <lb/>Both models predict a similar peak intensity at the same location. It appears <lb/>that the four-equation SG cavitation model provides a better estimation of <lb/>the pressure fluctuations decrease in the re-compression area. <lb/>This study reveals that the four-equation SG cavitation is well adapted to <lb/>simulate the behaviour of the cavitation pocket especially in the closure part <lb/>of the cavity. Moreover, this model presents the large advantage to not <lb/>involve tunable parameters. In the next part, this model will be used to <lb/>compare the LEGI&apos;s and OpenFOAM softwares. <lb/> 5.4. Comparison with OpenFOAM simulations <lb/> Comparisons between the LEGI solver and OpenFOAM are proposed on a <lb/>similar mesh using the k ° ! SST turbulence model. The considered cavita-<lb/>tion models are the 4-equation SG model and the Kunz model, respectively. <lb/>The time of simulation is about 2 s. <lb/>Time-averaged void ratio and velocity profiles are presented in Figure 12 from <lb/>stations 1 to 5. Inside the attached cavity sheet, at stations 1 and 2, the both <lb/>solvers estimate a well cavity thickness and composition. At stations 3 and <lb/>

			4, the LEGI solver provides a better prediction of the void ratio decrease <lb/>due to the presence of a mixture in this area. The OpenFOAM computation <lb/>over-predicts the vapour quantity inside the cavity (95% instead of 70% at <lb/>station 3 and 90% instead of 30% at station 3). Moreover, the thickness of <lb/>the cavity is under-estimated and a pure liquid phase is simulated close to <lb/>the wall. At station 5, both the cavity thickness and the re-entrant jet are <lb/>badly simulated by the OpenFOAM software. Although the re-entrant phe-<lb/>nomenon is well observed in experiments, the OpenFOAM simulation does <lb/>not reproduce the recirculation area. <lb/>The time-averaged wall pressure distributions are compared in Figure 13. <lb/>The two models present a diAEerent re-compression area respectively located <lb/>downstream the experimental measures with the LEGI solver and upstream <lb/>with the OpenFOAM solver. The rate of re-compression is also under-<lb/>estimated by the OpenFOAM solver. <lb/>A study of the Root Mean Square (RMS) wall pressure fluctuations is pro-<lb/>posed in Figure 14. The peak of fluctuations position is varying among the <lb/>case. The OpenFOAM solver provides a maximum of fluctuations located <lb/>upstream the closure area of the cavity sheet (x ° x  i  º 0.2 in experiments), <lb/>whereas it is predicted downstream by the LEGI solver. <lb/>To conclude, the topology of the cavitation pocket marks large discrepancies <lb/>between the two softwares, especially as regards the re-entrant jet develop-<lb/>ment.

Conclusion <lb/> An aperiodic partial cavitation pocket has been studied in a 2D venturi con-<lb/>figuration by numerical one-fluid unsteady RANS simulations. Numerical <lb/>results have been compared with experimental data concerning the void ra-<lb/>tio, streamwise velocity, wall pressure and wall pressure fluctuations. <lb/>First, calculations have been carried out with an in-house code. The one-fluid <lb/>RANS equations have been successively coupled with the Smith k ° `, the <lb/>Spalart-Allmaras, the Jones-Launder k ° &quot; and the Menter k ° ! SST tur-<lb/>bulence models. Two cavitation models using an explicit formulation of the <lb/>mass transfer between phases have also been compared: the first one based <lb/>on a barotropic EOS and the second one based on a mixture of stiAEened gas <lb/>EOS. Comparisons revealed that similar results were obtained using diAEerent <lb/>turbulence models when an eddy viscosity limiter is introduced. For this test <lb/>case, the turbulence model influence is weak. Then, a cavitation model com-<lb/>parison was performed using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The <lb/>new four-equation model has improved the re-entrant jet simulation down-<lb/>stream the attached cavity by diminishing the void ratio values close to the <lb/>wall. A better estimation of the pressure fluctuations is also provided by this <lb/>model. A very positive point is the free-parameter formulation of the source <lb/>term, which avoids poisonous calibration problems. <lb/>Secondly, simulations has been carried out with the OpenFOAM software us-<lb/>

			ing another formulation of void ratio transport equation cavitation models. <lb/>Calculations were performed on a similar mesh using the Menter SST tur-<lb/>bulence model. Large discrepancies appeared between the two solvers and <lb/>the OpenFOAM simulations were not able to reproduce the re-entrant jet <lb/>phenomenon. Maybe it is due to a calibration problem of the mass transfer <lb/>model involving two tunable parameters. The new LEGI model is therefore <lb/>very attractive to simulate such partial cavitation pockets. <lb/>Additional works are in progress to pursue comparative analyses between <lb/>turbulence and cavitation models and to extend the formulation with ther-<lb/>modynamic eAEects. <lb/> Appendix <lb/> Appendix A: the speed of sound in a mixture of stiAEened gas <lb/> Starting from the usual thermodynamic relation <lb/> de = T ds + <lb/> P <lb/> Ω  2  dΩ <lb/> or <lb/> d(Ωe) = ΩT ds + hdΩ <lb/> (26) <lb/>And with the diAEerential of Ωe: <lb/> d(Ωe) = <lb/> µ @Ωe <lb/>@Ω <lb/> ∂ <lb/> P <lb/> dΩ + <lb/> µ @Ωe <lb/>@P <lb/> ∂ <lb/> Ω <lb/> dP <lb/> (27) <lb/>We can obtain the diAEerential of the pressure P : <lb/> µ @Ωe <lb/>@P <lb/> ∂ <lb/> Ω <lb/> dP = ΩT ds + <lb/> ∑ <lb/> h ° <lb/> µ @Ωe <lb/>@Ω <lb/> ∂ <lb/> P <lb/> ∏ <lb/> dΩ <lb/> (28) <lb/>We deduce an expression of the speed of sound: <lb/> c  2  = <lb/> µ @P <lb/>@Ω <lb/> ∂ <lb/> s <lb/> = <lb/> h ° <lb/> ≥ <lb/> @Ωe <lb/>@Ω <lb/> ¥ <lb/> P <lb/> °  @Ωe <lb/>@P <lb/> ¢ <lb/> Ω <lb/> (29) <lb/>
