In this sense, nutrition education and early exposure to healthy menus in <lb/>childhood is important. Children these days have easy access to the internet. Thus, a web-based nutrition education program for children is an <lb/>effective tool for nutrition education of children. This site provides the material of the nutrition education for children with characters which are <lb/>personified nutrients. The 151 menus are stored in the site together with video script of the cooking process. The menus are classified by the <lb/>criteria based on age, menu type and the ethnic origin of the menu. The site provides a search function. There are three kinds of search conditions <lb/>which are key words, menu type and &quot;between&quot; expression of nutrients such as calorie and other nutrients. The site is developed with the operating <lb/>system Windows 2003 Server, the web server ZEUS 5, development language JSP, and database management system Oracle 10 g. <lb/>Key Words: Web-based nutrition program, healthy menu, nutrition education <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction 10) <lb/>Childhood is a critical time of human development. The most <lb/>common nutrition-related problems among children include <lb/>under-nutrition, iron-deficiency anemia, dental caries, high blood <lb/>lipid profile, overweight and obesity (Boyle, 2003). In 2003, the <lb/>Korea president announced the First Year of Children&apos;s Safety. <lb/>Since then, the government has promoted various polices in order <lb/>to enhance children&apos;s health. However, they appear to lack a <lb/>comprehensive vision or systematic development of action plans. <lb/>The eating habits which developed in childhood greatly affect <lb/>one&apos;s lifelong habits and health. Besides, the education to provide <lb/>information on food safety and nutrition has not been adequate. <lb/>Improper dietary habits and unhealthy life styles may have <lb/>resulted in a radical increase in producing number of overweight <lb/>and obese children and teenagers. The Korea National Health <lb/>&amp; Nutrition Survey 2005 revealed that over the past seven years, <lb/>there has been a significant 1.5-fold increase in the number of <lb/>overweight boys and girls under 18 years of age. And dietary <lb/>intakes of children were deficient in calcium and potassium. In <lb/>contrast, the intakes of protein and sodium were becoming <lb/>excessive (Department of Health and Welfare &amp; Korea Health <lb/>Industry Development Institute, 2006). <lb/>Nutrition education for children is valuable in changing dietary <lb/>behaviors and promoting health, considering that good eating <lb/>behavior formed in childhood would continue to later life. Some <lb/>off-line programs on menu planning and nutrition analysis have <lb/>been developed and used (Han, 1997; Hong, 1989; Hong, 1996; <lb/>Joni, 1983; Kang et al., 1999; Kolasa &amp; Miller, 1996). The use <lb/>of internet has become popular in Korea. Those who use internet <lb/>reached 75% in 2006; of those aged 6-19 years, 98.5% used <lb/>the internet (National Internet Development Agency of Korea <lb/>&amp; Ministry of Information Communication Republic of Korea, <lb/>2007). So, needs for web-based contents have been rapidly <lb/>increasing in educational fields. &quot;Diet and meal management&quot; <lb/>of lecture contents and software system for web-based nutritional <lb/>assessment and counseling (Youn, 2001) were researched. The <lb/>Korean Society of Community Nutrition, Nutrition Education <lb/>Center of Ulsan University, The Korean Food &amp; Nutrition <lb/>Society and KFDA are running internet-based nutrition education <lb/>programs. Some web-based programs for nutrition were deve-<lb/>loped (Han, 2000; Han &amp; Jeong, 2004; Her &amp; Lee, 2002; Her <lb/></body>

But it is limited to adults and not <lb/>easy for an inexperienced person. Those of the program have <lb/>to be developed for wider groups of people. Needs for nutrition <lb/>education of children are increasing and related resources are <lb/>essential (Park et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2006). Internet could <lb/>be a useful route for children to provide nutrition information <lb/>and educational messages. Many kinds of topics or methods <lb/>might be effectively applied, in designing and planning nutrition <lb/>web-sites or planning education programs, for example cooking <lb/>or selecting snacks, flash animation with nutrition messages. <lb/>Nutrition web-sites for children should be constructed in a way <lb/>that children find the sites easily and search the contents for <lb/>fun (Ahn et al., 2007; Ahn &amp; Kim, 2007). So, we tried to make <lb/>kid-friendly web-based nutrition education searching system for <lb/>healthy menu recipe and easily learned nutrition information with <lb/>a lot of searching methods. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>The implementation of the system <lb/>This system is on the operating system the Windows 2003 <lb/>Server, which is Zeus. The languages for the development of <lb/>this site are Java Server Page and Java Script. It does not make <lb/>use of ActiveX and only uses HTML because the site with <lb/>ActiveX functions can be in operation with a particular browser. <lb/>The meal plan and nutrition evaluation go through complicated <lb/>procedures and calculation processes. This is why the deve-<lb/>lopment procedures are important. The site is based on MVC <lb/>Model2 (Model View Controller Pattern). The DBMS is Oracle <lb/>10 g. The content is shown in Table 1. <lb/>Construction of web contents <lb/>The web contents contain introductions of a home-page, the <lb/>menu of three age groups (infants, children and adolescents) and <lb/>menu search. The contents are menu pictures, cooking methods, <lb/>macro nutrients and sodium levels, video scripts of cooking <lb/>courses, close-up of menu pictures, exchange of weight and <lb/>printing. <lb/>The DB structure <lb/>The DB (Database) of the system consists of 4 segments. They <lb/>are healthy menu DB, food nutrient DB, nutrition intake guideline <lb/>DB and nutrient guideline DB. Healthy menu DB is developed <lb/>in the sub-project of this research. It is shown in Table 2. Food <lb/>nutrient DB is based on the 7th food table of 2006 of National <lb/>Rural Living Science Institute. Nutrition intake guideline DB is <lb/>based on the data of The Korean Nutrition Society 2005. Nutrient <lb/>Daily Value guideline DB is based on the data of KFDA 2007. <lb/>Menu searching method <lb/>Users can search by the title of a menu, ingredients, menu <lb/>types (main dish, dessert), ethnic food and each nutrient. With <lb/>those searching conditions, the screen can show recipe, video <lb/>script, food data of menu and nutrients. <lb/>Results <lb/>Contents and search function <lb/>The site of the department of nutritional evaluation in Korea <lb/>Food and Drug Administration (http://nutrition.kfda.go.kr) is Fig. <lb/>1, which is involved in a banner for children&apos;s healthy menus. <lb/>The contents of this children&apos;s healthy menus site are classified <lb/>into four groups. The first is introduction of this home page. <lb/>It explains the overall introduction of this site. The second page <lb/>contains the information of menus for infants, children and <lb/>adolescents (Fig. 2). This part contains all information which <lb/>users want to get by a search function. The third part provides <lb/>a search function so that users can find the information which <lb/>they need. The users specify search conditions. Types of the <lb/>conditions are menu name, raw material of a menu, types of <lb/>menus such as main dish, side dish and dessert, many kinds of <lb/>ethnic menu such as Korean food, Chinese food, Japanese food, <lb/>Western style food, Southeast Asian food, nineteen nutrients and <lb/>calories and so on. The fourth part, NutriEval, is like this site. <lb/>The NutriEval is another web-based program for meal plan <lb/>drafting and nutrition evaluation. It is an independent program <lb/>itself. It will be discussed in another chance. <lb/></body>

This is the page <lb/>which has links to the contents classified into eight groups. They <lb/>are &quot;Cali and Friends&quot;, &quot;Food Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Nutrition Safari&quot;, <lb/>&quot;Guideline of Diet Plan&quot;, &quot;Guideline of Nutrition Intake&quot;, <lb/>&quot;Guideline of Nutrition Ingredient&quot;, &quot;Nutrition Manifest&quot; and <lb/>&quot;NutriEval&quot;. <lb/>Cali and friends as nutrient nicknames <lb/>&quot;Cali&quot; means Calorie. Because this site is focused on children, <lb/>the terminology had better be familiar and easy to use and <lb/>pronounce for children. For this reason, some of the nutrients <lb/>are given an alias, gender and character. Children learn the <lb/>nutrients by playing with the alias. The aliases are &quot;Cali&quot;, <lb/>&quot;Carbo&quot;, &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Lipi&quot;, &quot;Mine&quot; and &quot;Vita&quot;. They are associated <lb/>with &quot;Calorie and Energy&quot;, &quot;Carbohydrate&quot;, &quot;Protein&quot;, &quot;Lipid, <lb/>Fats and Oil&quot;, &quot;Mineral&quot; and &quot;Vitamin&quot;, correspondingly. Fig. <lb/>4 is the &quot;Cali and Friends&quot; page. <lb/>Nutrition safari <lb/>In this page, children learn the importance of nutrients by a <lb/>&quot;safari tour&quot;. The contents consist of two parts. One is &quot;nutrition <lb/>café&quot; and the other is &quot;nutrition villages&quot;. Fig. 5 is the page <lb/>of the &quot;nutrition safari&quot;. <lb/>Nutrition café: Children learn what nutrients do in their bodies. <lb/>In addition to the functions of nutrients, the children learn the <lb/>reason why they have to eat well-balanced foods and how to <lb/>eat healthy foods. Fig. 6 is the page of &quot;Nutrition café&quot;. <lb/>Nutrition villages: There are eight villages. They are &quot;Carbo-<lb/>hydrate&quot;, &quot;Protein&quot;, &quot;Lipid&quot;, &quot;Mineral&quot;, &quot;Vitamin&quot;, &quot;Fiber&quot;, <lb/>&apos;Water&quot; and &quot;Calorie&quot;. Children learn what nutrients do in their <lb/>bodies by visiting the villages. They also learn the food in which <lb/>the nutrients are abundant. Fig. 7 is the page of &quot;Carbohydrate&quot; <lb/>village, one of the eight villages. <lb/></body>

Each layer of the food guide <lb/>tower shows in turn to the upper step that nutrients should be <lb/>taken in lesser amounts. There are four layers. The function of <lb/>each layer&apos;s food type is explained. The symptom is also <lb/>explained when each layer&apos;s nutrition is over-eaten or is deficient <lb/>in a body. <lb/>Guideline of diet plan <lb/>This page gives the guidelines of diet plan for the age groups, <lb/>infants, children and adolescents (Fig. 9). For each age group, <lb/>there are seven recommendations by their age and critical <lb/>nutrition education and the characters which are the alias of <lb/>important nutrients. <lb/>Guideline of dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for Koreans <lb/>On this page, users will learn why guidelines of a diet plan <lb/>are so important (Fig. 10). There are four criteria in the guideline, <lb/>which are average, recommended, sufficient and upper limit <lb/>amount (DRIs, Korean Nutrition Society 2005). In the nutrition <lb/>intake table, users can find the most appropriate criteria of the <lb/>four criteria for them because those kinds of criteria are different <lb/>by the age, gender and nutrient needs. <lb/>Guideline of nutrients daily value (DV) <lb/>The guideline of nutrients is the representative value for each <lb/>ingredient.

The menus are classified into groups by the criteria of <lb/>age, menu type, and ethnic origin of menu. The items of menu <lb/>type are main dish, side dish, dessert, etc. The items of ethnic <lb/>menus are Korean food, Chinese food, Japanese food, Western <lb/>style food, Southeast Asian food, etc. This information also is <lb/>searched by the search function. Fig. 13 is the page showing <lb/>the main dish for infants. There are screen scripts showing the <lb/>cooking process of a menu (Fig. 14). There is also a trans-<lb/>formation program which modifies the weights of raw materials <lb/>of a menu according to the change of weight of a certain raw <lb/>material of the menu. Fig. 15 shows a cooking course with video <lb/>script. <lb/>Search function <lb/>This site provides the search function which finds a menu under <lb/>a certain condition. It comes from 151 menus developed by the <lb/>sub-project in association with this research. The search <lb/>conditions are classified into three categories based on the <lb/>contents of the sub-expression. <lb/>The first one is the key word expression. The search content <lb/>expressions of the combination of the name of menu, name of <lb/>food materials, age group, menu type, menu style and nutrients. <lb/>The site accommodates the both the Korean and English names. <lb/>Fig. 16 is the menu search page whose search condition is <lb/>pumpkin. The second one is the &quot;between&quot; expression of the <lb/>lower bound and the upper bound of a certain nutrition ingredient <lb/>such as calorie and other nutrients. The absence of either of the <lb/>bound expressions means the value higher than the lower bound <lb/>value or the value lower than the upper bound. Fig. 17 is the <lb/>result of menu search. If we chose pumpkin as the title of menu, <lb/>we can the result of pumpkin menu and then, we can click wider <lb/>picture, recipe, video script, raw material of menu, nutrient and <lb/>specific capture. <lb/></body>

For this goal, the web-based <lb/>program is the most familiar and friendly interface to school <lb/>children. Some web-based programs for nutrition were developed <lb/>(Han &amp; Jeong, 2004; Her &amp; Lee, 2002; Hong &amp; Kim, 2005; <lb/>Lee et al., 2002), but web-based nutrition education programs <lb/>for children are very limited. Nutrition web-sites for children <lb/>should be constructed in a way which children find the sites <lb/>easily and search the contents while having fun (Ahn et al., 2007; <lb/>Ahn &amp; Kim, 2007). <lb/>We developed and composed this website to implement a <lb/>database program to store contents and search function. This <lb/>study has been focusing on a standardization of nutrient infor-<lb/>mation. To date, in the domestic environment, it is difficult to <lb/>find any research, organization or homepage that provides the <lb/>standards of nutrient expression. Therefore, we anticipate that <lb/>the constructed nutrient database system will make a contribution <lb/>to save nutrition information and to design criteria for sharing <lb/></body>

			<body>its information. In the introduction of this site, contents of DRIs <lb/>and Daily Value (DV) were added. Recently, restaurant nutrition <lb/>labeling was researched and it would become set in a legal term <lb/>(Hong &amp; Jeong, 2007) to prevent global tendency of high calorie <lb/>diet and out-going food. <lb/>The home page explains the site as a whole. This page has <lb/>links to the contents classified into eight nutrient groups. These <lb/>contents were considered for needs of nutrition education (Park <lb/>et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2006). Previous web-based nutrition <lb/>programs did not include them. So these kinds of trials will be <lb/>good education tools (Han &amp; Jeong, 2004; Her &amp; Lee, 2002; <lb/>Hong &amp; Kim, 2005). <lb/>This site contains menus for infants, children and adolescents. <lb/>The menus can be searched by many categories and have screen <lb/>scripts of the cooking process. There is also a transforming <lb/>program that modifies the weights of raw materials of menus <lb/>according to the change of weight of a certain raw material of <lb/>the menu. This site provides the search function for 151 healthy <lb/>menus for children in association with this research. <lb/>We tried to make the program from the children&apos;s viewpoints, <lb/>but some did not work properly. And the menu for the kids is <lb/>very limited. So we have to provide easier and a variety of menus <lb/>having more nutritious ingredients for the kids. This kind of effort <lb/>was organized for kid&apos;s easy access and attribute motive to learn <lb/>about food and nutrition. It will give better motive for education <lb/>needs of kids (Park et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2006). These kinds <lb/>of trials can be helpful for a future disease preventing program <lb/>and it could give knowledgeable information to the kids. We <lb/>hope that these kinds of web-based systems could be widely used <lb/>for nutrition education for kids and adults. <lb/></body>
