			<front>New Pyrochlore Oxide Superconductor RbOs 2 O 6 <lb/>Shigeki Yonezawa*, Yuji Muraoka, Yoshitaka Matsushita and Zenji Hiroi <lb/>Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8581 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>We report the discovery of a new pyrochlore oxide superconductor RbOs 2 O 6 . <lb/>The compound crystallizes in the same β-pyrochlore structure as the recently discovered <lb/>superconductor KOs 2 O 6 , where Os atoms form a corner-sharing tetrahedral network <lb/>called the pyrochlore lattice with Rb or K atoms in the cage. Resistivity, magnetic <lb/>susceptibility and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples evidence a <lb/>bulk superconductivity with T c = 6.3 K. <lb/>KEYWORDS: superconductivity, pyrochlore oxide <lb/>*E-mail address: yonezawa@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp <lb/> </front>

			<body>Pyrochlore oxides have the general chemical formula A 2 B 2 O 7 or A 2 B 2 O 6 O&apos;, where <lb/>A is a larger cation and B is a smaller transition metal (TM) cation. 1) The ideal <lb/>pyrochlore structure is composed of two types of cation-oxygen sublattices: one is a <lb/>corner-sharing tetrahedral network composed of A atoms with an O&apos; atom in the center <lb/>of each tetrahedron, and the other is another tetrahedral network of B atoms with each B <lb/>atom coordinated quasi-octahedrally by six O atoms. This type of tetrahedral network <lb/>is called the pyrochlore lattice, and has been studied extensively in order to elucidate the <lb/>effect of geometrical frustration on the properties of localized spin and itinerant electron <lb/>systems. <lb/>Recently, superconductivity was found in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 (Re 5+ : 5d 2 ) at T c = K for the <lb/>first time in the family of pyrochlore oxides. 2-4) <lb/>The mechanism of the <lb/>superconductivity appears to be conventional, and may be understood in the framework <lb/>of the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. 5) Very recently, we <lb/>have discovered a new pyrochlore oxide KOs 2 O 6 which exhibits superconductivity at <lb/>9.6 K. 6) Our preliminary structural analysis indicates that it crystallizes in a cubic <lb/>structure with space group <lb/>m <lb/>Fd3 , as in the ideal pyrochlore oxides, but with K atoms <lb/></body>

			<body>located at the O&apos; site of the ideal pyrochlore structure. It is known that the pyrochlore <lb/>structure sometimes tolerates vacancies at the A and O&apos; sites. 1) Such pyrochlore <lb/>oxides are generally called defect pyrochlores. By contrast, KOs 2 O 6 should not be <lb/>classified as defect pyrochlores, because of the apparent difference in the metal <lb/>occupations. Thus, we call this AB 2 O 6 type oxide a β-pyrochlore oxide to distinguish <lb/>it from ordinary defect pyrochlore oxides. In the following search for a new <lb/>superconductor, we have obtained a new ternary phase RbOs 2 O 6 with the β-pyrochlore <lb/>structure, which exhibits superconductivity at 6.3 K. <lb/>Polycrystalline samples were prepared from Rb 2 O and Os. The two powders <lb/>were mixed in the molar ratio of Rb 2 O:Os = 1:4, ground and pressed into a pellet in a <lb/>dry atmosphere. The pellet was heated in an evacuated silica tube at 773 K for 24 h. <lb/>It was necessary in the preparation process to avoid the formation of highly toxic OsO 4 . <lb/>In order to control the oxygen partial pressure in the silica tube, an appropriate amount <lb/>of AgO was added to the end of the silica tube: AgO decomposes into silver and oxygen <lb/>above 370 K, and thus generates an oxidizing atmosphere. The chemical composition of <lb/>the product examined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron <lb/>microscope was Rb:Os ~ 1:2. <lb/>Figure 1 shows a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern taken at room <lb/>temperature. All the intense peaks can be indexed assuming a cubic unit cell with a <lb/>lattice constant a = 1.0114 nm. A few extra peaks from Os are also detected. <lb/>Extinctions observed in the XRD pattern are consistent with the space group of <lb/>m <lb/>Fd3 , <lb/>which is expected for the ideal pyrochlore structure. However, the relative peak <lb/>intensities are significantly different from those of typical pyrochlore oxides, and are <lb/>similar to those reported for KOs 2 O 6 . 6) Therefore, it is thought that RbOs 2 O 6 has the <lb/>same β-pyrochlore structure as KOs 2 O 6 . <lb/>Resistivity measurements were carried out down to 0.5 K by the standard <lb/>four-probe method in a Quantum Design PPMS equipped with a 3 He refrigerator. As <lb/>shown in Fig. 2(a), the temperature dependence of resistivity for RbOs 2 O 6 exhibits good <lb/>metallic behavior below room temperature, without any signs of phase transitions such <lb/>as observed in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 <lb/>7) or Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . 2) It is also significantly different from that <lb/>reported for KOs 2 O 6 : A clear T 2 temperature dependence is seen below 30 K for <lb/>RbOs 2 O 6 , which is absent for KOs 2 O 6 . 6) When a sample is further cooled, the <lb/>resistivity sharply drops below 6.5 K due to superconductivity. The resistivity below <lb/>the transition is nearly zero within our experimental resolution. The critical <lb/>temperature T c , defined as the midpoint temperature of the transition, is 6.3 K, and zero <lb/>resistivity is attained below 6.1 K. It is to be noted that the resistivity starts to decrease <lb/></body>

			<body>significantly at the high temperature of about 8 K, although the reason for this is not <lb/>clear. <lb/>In addition to the observation of the zero-resistivity transition, a large diamagnetic <lb/>signal associated with the Meissner effect has been observed below 6.3 K. Figure 2(b) <lb/>shows a temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility measured on a powdered <lb/>sample in a Quantum Design MPMS. The measurements were carried out in a <lb/>magnetic field of 10 Oe on heating after zero-field cooling and then on cooling in the <lb/>field. A superconducting volume fraction estimated at 2 K from the zero-field cooling <lb/>experiment is almost 100 %, which is sufficiently large to constitute bulk <lb/>superconductivity. <lb/>The superconducting transition has also been detected by specific heat C <lb/>measurements. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the specific heat divided by temperature <lb/>suddenly increases below 6.3 K, and forms a broad maximum around 5.8 K. The <lb/>shape of this anomaly is unusual, and is different from what one expects for a <lb/>conventional superconductor. The details will be described elsewhere. <lb/>The superconductivity of RbOs 2 O 6 is robust against magnetic fields as shown in <lb/>the resistivity measurements under magnetic fields of Fig. 3(a). When the magnetic <lb/>field is increased, the transition curve systematically shifts to lower temperatures. The <lb/>superconductivity remains even at µ 0 H = 14 T at 0.5 K. The field dependence of T c , <lb/>which was determined as the midpoint of the transition, is plotted in Fig. 3(b). The <lb/>upper critical field at T = 0 may be around 17 T, which seems to be larger than Pauli&apos;s <lb/>limit, 12 T, for a weak-coupling BCS type superconductor in the absence of spin-orbit <lb/>interactions. However, as suggested by the previous band-structure calculations on <lb/>related compounds, 8) the spin-orbit interactions can be significantly large in the 5d TM <lb/>pyrochlore oxides, and thus the actual Pauli&apos;s limit can be larger than 12 T. <lb/>In conclusion, we found superconductivity with T c = 6.3 K in a new β-pyrochlore <lb/>oxide RbOs 2 O 6 . The nature of this superconductivity is to be clarified in a future study. <lb/>However, we believe that an interesting aspect of physics is involved in the <lb/>superconductivity of RbOs 2 O 6 , as in that of KOs 2 O 6 , on the basis of the itinerant <lb/>electrons on the pyrochlore lattice. <lb/></body>
