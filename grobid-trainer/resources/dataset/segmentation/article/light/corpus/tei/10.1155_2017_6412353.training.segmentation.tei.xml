Casein-degrading serine protease autotransporter of enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) subfamily protein SigA, an <lb/>outer membrane protein, exerts both cytopathic and enterotoxic effects especially cytopathic to human epithelial cell type-2 <lb/>(HEp-2) and is shown to be highly immunogenic. In the present study, we have tried to impose the vaccinomics approach for <lb/>designing a common peptide vaccine candidate against the immunogenic SigA of Shigella spp. At first, 44 SigA proteins from <lb/>different variants of S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei were assessed to find the most antigenic protein. We <lb/>retrieved 12 peptides based on the highest score for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes analysed by NetCTL. Initially, <lb/>these peptides were assessed for the affinity with MHC class I and class II alleles, and four potential core epitopes <lb/>VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, and IELAGTLTL were selected. From these, FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL <lb/>peptides were shown to have 100% conservancy. Finally, IELAGTLTL was shown to have the highest population coverage <lb/>(83.86%) among the whole world population. In vivo study of the proposed epitope might contribute to the development of <lb/>functional and unique widespread vaccine, which might be an operative alleyway to thwart dysentery from the world. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Background <lb/>Shigella is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, nonmotile, <lb/>nonspore forming, and rod-shaped true bacteria closely <lb/>related to Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The resulting <lb/>infection by this organism called shigellosis, also known as <lb/>bacillary dysentery or Marlow syndrome, is most typically <lb/>associated with diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symp-<lb/>toms in humans. This pathogen is usually found in water that <lb/>is contaminated with human feces within the setting of poor <lb/>hygiene among kids of underneath 5 years old and is trans-<lb/>mitted via the fecal-oral route. The infection will occur even <lb/>if there is just a bodily function of only ten to one hundred <lb/>microorganisms [1]. In each year, 165 million cases of Shi-<lb/>gella infection are accounted worldwide, of that, 163 million <lb/>take place in developing countries and ultimately result in <lb/>millions of death [2]. Bangladesh has got the top rates of shig-<lb/>ellosis according to the recent Global Enteric Multicenter <lb/>Study (GEMS) in Asia. The output of this study has revealed <lb/>that the Shigella is the third leading reason behind diarrhoea <lb/>in children [3, 4]. <lb/>Shigella species are usually classified into four serogroups: <lb/>S. dysenteriae (12 serotypes), S. flexneri (6 serotypes), S. boy-<lb/>dii (18 serotypes), and S. sonnei (one serotype) based on the <lb/></body>

			<body>biochemical properties and group-specific O antigens <lb/>within the outer portion of the semipermeable membrane. <lb/>S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, and S. boydii are physiologically <lb/>similar in distinction to S. sonnei. Among them, S. flex-<lb/>neri is the most frequently isolated species globally and <lb/>accounts for 60% of cases in the unindustrialized coun-<lb/>tries; S. sonnei causes 77% of cases in the industrialized <lb/>countries [1]. <lb/>The underlying therapeutic challenge to manage Shigella <lb/>is its accrued resistance to most often used antibiotics like <lb/>ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, and <lb/>sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim [5]. Earlier, ciprofloxacin, <lb/>a third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been <lb/>used effectively for the treatment of bacillary dysentery <lb/>[6]. However, this antibiotic is no longer helpful for the <lb/>treatment of bacillary dysentery in south Asian countries <lb/>together with Bangladesh, because of the dissemination <lb/>of fluoroquinolone-resistant variety and its equivalent clones <lb/>across the countries [7, 8]. Hence, it is essential to find a <lb/>sustainable approach like vaccinomics, which can elicit <lb/>long-term and consistent immunological responses to fight <lb/>against Shigella. <lb/>SigA is annotated in the she pathogenicity island of <lb/>Shigella, encoding SigA protein which belongs to the serine <lb/>protease autotransporter of enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) <lb/>subgroup proteins. The autotransporter proteins of Gram-<lb/>negative bacteria exhibit an N-terminal signal sequence, <lb/>required for secretion across the inner membrane, and a C-<lb/>terminal domain that forms an amphipathic β-barrel pore <lb/>that allows passage of the functional domain across the outer <lb/>membrane. This type of exporter proteins either remains <lb/>attached to the cell surface or is released from the cell <lb/>by proteolytic cleavage [9]. SigA is a multifunctional pro-<lb/>tein, able to degrade casein with cytotoxic and enterotoxic <lb/>effects. Moreover, SigA is cytopathic for human epithelial <lb/>type-2 (HEp-2) cells, causing morphological changes and <lb/>loss of integrity of the cell monolayers, important for the <lb/>pathologic process of Shigella [10]. The position of SigA <lb/>in the chromosome made them less vulnerable to loss <lb/>compare to the other virulence factors harbouring within <lb/>the plasmid, and more exposure to the immune cells <lb/>occurred by this secreted toxin [11]. Most importantly, <lb/>this protein has been shown to be immunogenic following <lb/>infection with Shigella [10]. The generalized modules of <lb/>membrane antigen-(GMMA-) based outer membrane <lb/>proteins including SigA were also shown to be highly <lb/>immunogenic [12], which prompted us to target SigA as <lb/>one of the best vaccine candidates and to design potential <lb/>peptide vaccine covering all the Shigella spp. and most of <lb/>the regions of the world. <lb/>Epitope-based immunizing agents are often an inex-<lb/>pensive choice to thwart enteric Shigella infection. The <lb/>identification of specific epitopes derived from infectious <lb/>pathogens has considerably advanced the event of epitope-<lb/>based vaccines (EVs). Higher understanding of the molecular <lb/>basis of substance recognition and human leukocyte antigen-<lb/>(HLA-) binding motifs has resulted in the advancement of <lb/>rationally designed vaccines that solely depends on algo-<lb/>rithms predicting the peptide&apos;s binding to human HLA. <lb/>The traditional process for the development of a vaccine is <lb/>very complex compared to that of the epitope-based vaccine, <lb/>and additionally, it is chemically stable, more specific, and <lb/>free of any infectious or oncogenic potential hazard [13]. <lb/>However, the invention of a wet laboratory-based candidate <lb/>epitope is expensive and laborious that requires varied <lb/>medicine experiments in the laboratory for the ultimate <lb/>choice of epitopes. Hence, the interest for predicting epitopes <lb/>by computational strategies, alternate in silico approaches <lb/>among researchers, is growing bit by bit with reduced efforts. <lb/>Vaccinomics is the application of integrated knowledge <lb/>from different disciplines including immunogenetics and <lb/>immunogenomics to develop candidate next-generation <lb/>vaccine and understand its immune response [14]. Cur-<lb/>rently, various vaccinomics databases are accessible for <lb/>identification of distinctive B lymphocyte epitopes and <lb/>HLA ligands with high sensitivity and specificity [15-17]. <lb/>The vaccinomics approach has already proven its potency <lb/>in identifying the conserved epitope in the case of human <lb/>immunodeficiency virus [18], multiple sclerosis [19], tuber-<lb/>culosis [20], and malaria [21] with desired results. In our <lb/>study, we have applied vaccinomics approaches for the <lb/>screening of potentially conserved epitopes by targeting <lb/>protein SigA. <lb/>2. Methods <lb/>The flow chart summarizing the protocols for the complete <lb/>epitope prediction is illustrated in Figure 1. <lb/>2.1. Sequence Retrieval and Antigenic Protein Determination. <lb/>The SigA protein sequences of different strains of Shigella <lb/>species were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank [22] data-<lb/>base and analysed in the VaxiJen v2.0 [23] server for the <lb/>determination of the most potent antigenic protein. Addi-<lb/>tionally, the target protein was crosschecked against human <lb/>pathogens and other similar pathogens to ensure the ortholo-<lb/>gous entry by using BLAST-P [24] and OrthoMCL [25] <lb/>databases [26]. <lb/>2.2. T-Cell Epitope Prediction and Affinity with MHC. The <lb/>epitope prediction for the respective protein and their affinity <lb/>score with MHC class I and class II allele was measured fol-<lb/>lowing previously used approach [27, 28]. Concisely, the <lb/>NetCTL v1.2 server [29] was used for predicting potential <lb/>cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from the most anti-<lb/>genic protein. A combined algorithms including MHC-I <lb/>binding, transporter of antigenic peptide (TAP) transport effi-<lb/>ciency, and proteasomal C-terminal cleavage prediction were <lb/>employed for the T-cell epitope prediction. The epitope with <lb/>the highest score for 12 MHC class I supertypes was selected. <lb/>T Cell Epitope Prediction Tools from Immune Epitope <lb/>Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) were used for <lb/>the prediction of affinity with MHC class I [30] and MHC <lb/>class II [31, 32]. The stabilized matrix method (SMM) was <lb/>used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration <lb/>(IC 50 ) of peptide binding to MHC class I with a preselected <lb/>9.0-mer epitope. The peptides were also assessed for HLA I <lb/>binding affinity by the software, EPISOFT. For the analyses <lb/></body>

			<body>of MHC class II binding, the IEDB-recommended method <lb/>was used for the specific HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR <lb/>loci. Fifteen-mer epitopes were designed for MHC class II <lb/>binding analysis considering the preselected 9-mer epitope <lb/>and its conserved region in the Shigella strains. For the <lb/>MHC class I and MHC class II alleles, the epitopes consisting <lb/>IC 50 &lt; 250 nM and IC 50 &lt; 100 nM, respectively, were selected <lb/>for further analysis. The MHC class II binding prediction <lb/>tool PREDIVAC was also used to assess their affinity with <lb/>HLA_DRB_1. <lb/>2.3. Cluster Analysis of the MHC Restricted Alleles. Further-<lb/>more, the MHCcluster v2.0 server [33] was used for the <lb/>identification of cluster of MHC restricted allele with <lb/>appropriate peptides to further strengthen our prediction. <lb/>This is the additional crosscheck of the predicted MHC <lb/>restricted allele analysis from the IEDB analysis resources. <lb/>The output from this server is a static heat map and a <lb/>graphical tree for describing the functional relationship <lb/>between peptides and HLAs. <lb/>Table 1: T-cell epitopes of SigA protein predicted by the NetCTL <lb/>server on the basis of the combined score.

As SPATE family is very <lb/>much specific for the enterobacteria, specifically, E. coli <lb/>and Shigella, we also include two E. coli sequences <lb/>(gi|693049347| and gi|699401135|) along with those of four <lb/>species of Shigella for MSA construction.

			<body>was used. The protein frustratometer server [41] was <lb/>employed for the detection of the stability and energy differ-<lb/>ences of the 3D structure of the protein. <lb/>2.6. Molecular Docking Analysis and HLA Allele Interaction. <lb/>Docking studies were also performed using the best possible <lb/>epitope following the strategy used in previous studies <lb/>[27, 28]. AutoDock Vina [42] was used for the docking <lb/>analysis. In our study, we have selected the HLA-E * 01:01 <lb/>molecule as a candidate for MHC class I and the HLA-<lb/>DQA1 as a candidate for MHC class II for docking analysis <lb/>because they are the available hits in the Protein Data Bank <lb/>(PDB) database. The PDB structure 2ESV, human cytomeg-<lb/>alovirus complexes with T-cell receptors, VMAPRTLIL <lb/>peptide, and 3PL6-structure of autoimmune TCR <lb/>Hy.1B11 in complex with HLA-DQ1-were retrieved from <lb/>the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics <lb/>(RCSB) protein database [43]. Then, the structures were <lb/>simplified by using PyMOL (the PyMOL Molecular Graphics <lb/>System, Version 1.5.0.4, Schrödinger, LLC) for the final <lb/>docking purpose. <lb/>The PEP-FOLD server [44] was used for the conversion <lb/>of the 3D structure of the epitope &quot;IELAGTLTL&quot; for MHC <lb/>I and the epitope &quot;KAIELAGTLTLTGTP&quot; for the MHC II <lb/>molecule in order to analyse the interaction with HLA alleles. <lb/>Finally, molecular docking was performed at the center of <lb/>X: 77.8087, Y: −3.2264, and Z: −9.5769 and the dimensions <lb/>(angstrom) of X: 31.4432, Y: 29.9517, and Z: 19.0455 for <lb/>the MHC I molecules. For the MHC II molecules, docking <lb/>was performed at the center of X: 38.5584, Y: 46.6132, and <lb/>Z: −36.4392 and the dimensions (angstrom) of X: 34.8104, <lb/>Y: 40.4401, and Z: 37.3366. Additionally, we have per-<lb/>formed a control docking with the experimentally known <lb/>peptide-MHC-bound complex. The PDB structure 2ESV, <lb/>human cytomegalovirus complexes with T-cell receptors, <lb/>and VMAPRTLIL peptide were used for this purpose. The <lb/>gridline was used at the center of X: 77.3404, Y: −3.5159, <lb/>and Z: −9.5829. <lb/>2.7. Allergenicity Investigation and B-Cell Epitope Prediction. <lb/>The AllerHunter server [45] was used to predict the <lb/>allergenicity of our proposed epitope for further securing <lb/>the prediction, and the support vector machine (SVM) <lb/>algorithm was used for the prediction within the server <lb/>[46]. The predicted T-cell epitope (15-mer) was screened <lb/>by IEDB-AR using a number of web-based tools for the <lb/>suitability as the B-cell epitope [47-49]. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. Analysis of the Retrieved Sequences and Their Antigenicity. <lb/>A total of 44 SigA proteins from different variants of S. flex-<lb/>neri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei were retrieved from <lb/>the GenBank database (Table S1 in Supplementary Material <lb/>available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6412353). <lb/>Thereafter, analyses with the VaxiJen v2.0 server showed the <lb/>protein with the accession number of gi|745767180| to have <lb/>the highest antigenicity of 0.6699 (Table S1). This highly <lb/>antigenic protein was further analysed to detect the highly <lb/>immunogenic epitope. No significant entry was found in the <lb/>orthologous entry search of our targeted protein. <lb/>3.2. T-Cell Epitope Identification. The NetCTLv1.2 server <lb/>identified the T-cell epitopes, where the epitope prediction <lb/>was confined to 12 MHC class I supertypes. Based on the <lb/>combined score, the top twelve epitopes (Table 1) were listed <lb/>for further analysis. <lb/>3.3. MHC Restriction and Cluster Analysis. IEDB analysis <lb/>resource predicted both MHC class I and MHC class II <lb/>restricted allele on the basis of the IC 50 value. All the pre-<lb/>dicted epitopes in Table 1 were assessed for the MHC inter-<lb/>action analysis. Epitopes for the MHC class I alleles are <lb/>presented in Table 2. The peptide IELAGTLTLT was pre-<lb/>dicted to have the highest number of MHC class I binding. <lb/>This peptide was predicted to have the binding affinity with <lb/>five MHC class I alleles including HLA-E * 01:01, HLA-<lb/>B * 40:01, HLA-B * 15:02, HLA-C * 03:03, and HLA-C * 12:03. <lb/>Furthermore, the interacted alleles were reassessed by clus-<lb/>ter analysis and are shown in Figure 2(a), as a heat map, <lb/>and in Figure S1A, as a dynamic tree.

			<body>and IELAGTLTL was found to have affinity with six HLA I <lb/>alleles (Table S3). From this analysis, we selected top four <lb/>peptides VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, <lb/>and IELAGTLTL depending on the affinity with most <lb/>MHC class I. <lb/>Epitopes for the MHC class II alleles are presented in <lb/>Table 3. Depending on the IC 50 values as well as on the <lb/>number of MHC class II alleles, three 15-mer peptide candi-<lb/>dates were selected. The peptides NSGFHTVTVNTLDAT, <lb/>KAIELAGTLTLTGTP, and AAKSYMSGNYKAFLT were <lb/>predicted to have high affinity with MHC-II allele, which <lb/>can interact with 32, 29, and 24 MHC class II alleles. The data <lb/>has been validated by another software PREDIVAC. The pre-<lb/>divac scores of the two core peptides FHTVTVNTL and <lb/>IELAGTLTL have been shown to be promising for their <lb/>binding to HLA_DRB_1 (Table 3). Accumulating both <lb/>MHC class I allele-and MHC class II allele-based analyses, <lb/>we showed FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL peptides to have <lb/>the best score to be a vaccine potential. <lb/>3.4. Conservancy Analysis and Position of the Epitopes. Con-<lb/>servancy of all the proposed epitopes was assessed by the <lb/>IEDB conservancy analysis tool and is summarized in <lb/>Table 4. FHTVTVNTL, IELAGTLTL, NYAWVNGNI, and <lb/>SMYNTLWRV were shown to have 100% conserved regions <lb/>across all the SigA proteins. The position of all the predicted <lb/>epitopes is shown in a multiple sequence alignment of SigA <lb/>proteins in Figure 3. Here, we used only our desired <lb/>sequences for the proper annotation. So, from the most <lb/>potential candidates, only two, that is, FHTVTVNTL and <lb/>IELAGTLTL, were found to be fully conserved. The top four <lb/>epitopes were shown within the protein in Figure 4. The <lb/>conservancy of both of these peptides were crosschecked <lb/>by PVS software, and it was found that they were located <lb/>in the conserved region of the SigA protein (Figure S5). <lb/>gi|647302223| Y K S <lb/>600 <lb/>610 <lb/>740 <lb/>750 <lb/>780 <lb/>N NQ I A S F S Q P DW E S R A I E LAG T L T TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>TGTP <lb/>L <lb/>QN Y W V N G NIKAS <lb/>840 <lb/>870 <lb/>880 <lb/>MYNT LW RV E N S <lb/>E NS <lb/>E NS <lb/>E NS <lb/>E NS <lb/>E NS <lb/>E NS <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>G F HTVTVNT L <lb/>F HTVTVNT L <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>SMYNT LWRV <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>Q NY WVNGN I K <lb/>A <lb/>NY WVNGN I <lb/>A <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>I E LAGT L T L <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>E S R A <lb/>K <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>I A S F S Q P DW <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>Y K S N NQ <lb/>gi|446956855| <lb/>gi|844758686| <lb/>gi|446956853| <lb/>gi|446956854| <lb/>gi|693049347| <lb/>gi|699401135| <lb/>Conservation <lb/>gi|647302223| <lb/>940 <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F Q E HTTWT L T GYKVA E N T AS S GAA K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F D <lb/>VT AR AG L G YQ F <lb/>VT AR AG L G Y <lb/>AR AG L G YQ F <lb/>D <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF L <lb/>K S YMS GNYK AF <lb/>K S YMS GNYK <lb/>YM S GN Y K A F <lb/>L <lb/>Q E HTTWT L T GYKVA E N T AS S GAA <lb/>Q E HTTWT L T GYKVA E N T AS S GAA <lb/>Q E HTTWT L T GYKVA E N T A S S GA A <lb/>Q E HT TWT L T G YKVA E N T AS S GAA <lb/>Q E HTTWT L T G YKVA E N T AS S GAA <lb/>Q E HTTWT L T GY <lb/>HTTWT L T G Y <lb/>KVA E N T A S S GA A <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F <lb/>T A P KGS N K E I F <lb/>T A P KGS N <lb/>Conservation <lb/>K E I <lb/>A P KGS N K E I <lb/>F <lb/>970 <lb/>980 <lb/>990 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1210 <lb/>gi|446956855| <lb/>gi|844758686| <lb/>gi|446956853| <lb/>gi|446956854| <lb/>gi|693049347| <lb/>gi|699401135| <lb/>Figure 3: MSA-based location identification of the different epitopes within the SPATE proteins of Shigella and their homologue in E. coli.

The docking interface was visualized with <lb/>the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. The 9.0-mer epitope <lb/>interacted with Arg-61, Asn-62, and Glu-152 through steric <lb/>interaction and formed hydrogen bonding with the Glu-156 <lb/>amino acid residues. On the other hand, the 15-mer epitope <lb/>interacted with Asp-55 through electrostatic interaction and <lb/>Glu-66 through steric interaction and formed hydrogen <lb/>bonding with the Gly-58, Arg-61, Asn-62, and Asn-82 amino <lb/>acid residues. The docking output and the interacted residues <lb/>are shown in Figures 7 and 8 with different orientations. <lb/>Furthermore, the control docking energy was found to be <lb/>−6.8 kcal/mol and is illustrated in Figure S4. <lb/>3.8. Allergenicity Analysis. The AllerHunter web server <lb/>predicted the sequence-based allergenicity calculation very <lb/>precisely. The allergenicity of the queried core epitope <lb/>(IELAGTLTLT) was 0.05 (sensitivity = 98.40%, specific-<lb/>ity = 27.4%), and the allergenicity of the 15-mer epitope <lb/>(KAIELAGTLTLTGTP) was 0.05 (sensitivity = 98.4%, <lb/>specificity = 27.0%). <lb/>3.9. B-Cell Epitope Prediction. B-cell epitope prediction was <lb/>obtained for the peptide KAIELAGTLTLTGTP (15 mer) <lb/>through the sequence-based approaches, and values are <lb/>anticipated with different parameters, ranging from −0.6464 <lb/>to 1.137. These values are the different propensity scores <lb/>and predicted with a threshold ranging from −0.352 to <lb/>1.037 (Figure 9). The Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity <lb/>scale was employed for evaluating the antigenic property of <lb/>the peptide with a maximum of 1.072. The antigenic plot is <lb/>showed in Figure 9(a). Peptide surface accessibility is another <lb/>important benchmark to meet up the criteria of a potential <lb/>B-cell epitope. Henceforth, Emini surface accessibility pre-<lb/>diction was employed, with a maximum propensity score of <lb/>1.137 (Figure 9(b)). To reinforce our provision for the predic-<lb/>tion of the epitope to elicit B-cell response, the Parker hydro-<lb/>philicity prediction was also employed with a maximum <lb/>score of 1.086 and is depicted in Figure 9(c). <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>Enteric infections are the foremost cause of sickness and <lb/>impermanence throughout the world, and only the Shigella <lb/>infections resulted in over a million deaths annually [2]. <lb/>The ever rising multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the <lb/>Shigella bacteria area unit are another international con-<lb/>cern for the researchers to search out a brand new resolu-<lb/>tion for preventing the deaths [50, 51]. Recently, there are <lb/>several studies that focus on the development of the vac-<lb/>cine against Shigella and continue in the clinical trial. <lb/>Most of them use attenuated and inactivated preparation <lb/>of the bacteria for eliciting immune responses which has <lb/>some potential escape risk [52-54].

			<body>tried to find out alternatives to treat this global burden <lb/>through vaccinomics approaches and targeting the immu-<lb/>nogenic and toxic protein SigA. The sequences of different <lb/>strains of Shigella showed that there is a little island of <lb/>conserved sequence throughout the species [55], and we <lb/>have focused on that target for designing the vaccine <lb/>candidate. The orthologous entry search of our targeted <lb/>protein revealed no significant similarity with human <lb/>pathogens and other closely related pathogens. These results <lb/>further strengthen our prediction through confirming no <lb/>cross immunity. <lb/>In recent time, most of the vaccines are grounded on B-<lb/>cell immunity; vaccines based on a T-cell epitope have been <lb/>invigorated lately. This is often as a result of body substance <lb/>response from memory B-cells which may be overawed basi-<lb/>cally by matter drift as time goes on, whereas cell-mediated <lb/>immunity repeatedly long-run immunity [56, 57]. <lb/>As a consequence, a T-lymphocyte epitope elicits a robust <lb/>and distinctive immune response through the cytotoxic <lb/>lymphocyte-(CTL-) mediated pathway and impedes the <lb/>spreading of the infectious agents by the CTL through recog-<lb/>nizing and killing the infected cells or by secreting specific <lb/>cytokines [58]. <lb/>The epitopes VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTW <lb/>TLTGY, and IELAGTLTL are primarily selected for the <lb/>designing of vaccine from the initial analysis depending on <lb/>the affinity with MHC class I and additionally confirmed <lb/>their presence along with those of the ancestral homologue <lb/>in E. coli (Figure 2). Finally, through substantiation with <lb/>different parameters, the core epitopes IELAGTLTL and <lb/>FHTVTVNTL (in 15.0-mer form, KAIELAGTLTLTGTP <lb/>and NSGFHTVTVNTLDAT, resp.) were found to be the <lb/>most potential and highly interacting HLA candidates for <lb/>MHC class II molecule. Furthermore, we have used <lb/>90°( <lb/>a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>Glu 66 B <lb/>Asn 82 B <lb/>Asp 55 A <lb/>Gly 58 A <lb/>Arg 61 A <lb/>Asn 62 A <lb/>(c) <lb/>Figure 8: Docking analysis of the predicted epitope KAIELAGTLTLTGTP and HLA-DQA1 allele.

			<body>pSORTb to predict the subcellular localization of SigA and <lb/>found that there is a score of 5.87 for localization in the <lb/>outer membrane and another score of 4.13 for extracellu-<lb/>lar localization. The result was quite similar with that for <lb/>the localization of other SPATE proteins in the bacterial <lb/>cell surface as well as in secreted forms. <lb/>three-dimensional model built through MODEL-<lb/>LER and validated by the Ramachandran plot with an <lb/>acceptable range resulted in the display of the perfect posi-<lb/>tion of the epitope on the surface of the structure. As the <lb/>epitope was found on the surface (Figure 4) of the model, it <lb/>would increase the possibility to interact with the immune <lb/>system earlier. Furthermore, the analysis from the DIS-<lb/>OPRED and frustration analysis servers strengthen our <lb/>prediction, though there are no disorder and energy frustra-<lb/>tion in the epitope region of the sequences and model, <lb/>respectively (Figure 5 and Figure S3). <lb/>To get the acceptability, vaccine candidates must have <lb/>wider population coverage. This is very much important <lb/>before designing. In our analysis, we have found that our <lb/>proposed epitope IELAGTLTL had combined population <lb/>coverage of 83.86%, whereas the other most potential can-<lb/>didate FHTVTVNTL had combined population coverage <lb/>of 50.61%. This output revealed that the proposed epitopes <lb/>would have wider coverage in vitro. <lb/>Molecular docking upkeeps the prediction with a higher <lb/>docking score and the perfectly oriented interactions between <lb/>the both MHC and the predicted 9.0-mer and 15-mer <lb/>epitopes. Additionally, comparative analysis with the experi-<lb/>mentally known peptide-MHC complex-has also revealed <lb/>the precision of our prediction through the similar binding <lb/>energy and interacted residues. Another significant finding <lb/>is the conservancy result. Through analysis of the whole <lb/>retrieved sequences, it was found that our predicted epitopes <lb/>have a 100% conservancy and hopefully they would be <lb/>potential candidates for treating all of the Shigella spp. Our <lb/>proposed epitopes are nonallergenic in nature according to <lb/>the FAO/WHO allergenicity evaluation scheme. <lb/>Finally, the core epitope &quot;IELAGTLTL&quot; was also found to <lb/>be more potential B-cell epitope candidates that were pro-<lb/>posed through the sequence-based approaches including <lb/>the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, Emini <lb/>surface accessibility prediction, and Parker hydrophilicity <lb/>prediction. From the overhead analysis, we envisage that <lb/>our suggested epitope would also elicit an immune response <lb/>in vitro. <lb/>Threshold <lb/>1.08 <lb/>1.07 <lb/>1.06 <lb/>1.05 <lb/>1.04 <lb/>1.03 <lb/>1.02 <lb/>1.01 <lb/>20 <lb/>0 <lb/>Position <lb/>Score <lb/>(a) <lb/>20 <lb/>Threshold <lb/>1.15 <lb/>1.10 <lb/>1.05 <lb/>1.00 <lb/>0.95 <lb/>0.90 <lb/>0 <lb/>Position <lb/>Score <lb/>(b) <lb/>20 <lb/>Threshold <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>-1.0 <lb/>-1.5 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>0 <lb/>Position <lb/>Score <lb/>(c) <lb/>Figure 9: B-cell epitope prediction.

			<body>5. Conclusion <lb/>The improved knowledge about antigen recognition at <lb/>molecular level led us to the development of rationally <lb/>designed peptide vaccines. The idea of peptide vaccines is <lb/>based on detecting and chemical synthesis of immunodomi-<lb/>nant B-cell and T-cell epitopes capable of evoking specific <lb/>immune responses. In this study, we used different compu-<lb/>tational tools to identify potential epitope targets against <lb/>Shigella which will help to decrease the cost and time of <lb/>wet lab experiments more successfully. Our bioinformatic <lb/>analyses speculate that the selected part of the outer mem-<lb/>brane and highly immunogenic protein, SigA, is a potential <lb/>candidate for a peptide vaccine. It might also contribute to <lb/>the reduction in the SigA-mediated pathogenicity to the host. <lb/>However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm <lb/>the efficiency of our identified peptide sequence as an epitope <lb/>vaccine against Shigella. <lb/></body>
