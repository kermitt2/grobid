To explore the value of whole-genome <lb/>sequencing (WGS) in broadening the scope of cancers potentially amenable <lb/>to a precision therapy, we analysed whole-genome sequencing data on <lb/>10,478 patients spanning 35 cancer types recruited to the UK 100,000 <lb/>Genomes Project.

		<body>Precision oncology aims to tailor therapy to the unique biology of the <lb/>patient&apos;s cancer, thereby optimizing treatment efficacy and minimizing <lb/>toxicity 1,2 . Underpinning precision oncology is the concept of somatic <lb/>driver mutations as the foundation of cancer biology 3,4 . <lb/>The expansion in the number of therapeutically actionable <lb/>genes has exposed the limitations of single-analyte genomic assays <lb/>in cancer 5 . The modest incremental cost of adding additional can-<lb/>cer genes to high-throughput sequencing-based panels has made <lb/>the development of drugs targeting increasingly smaller subsets of <lb/>molecularly defined patients with cancer financially and logistically <lb/>feasible 6 . The development of inhibitors effective in cancers driven by <lb/>rare genomic mutations has required the concurrent development <lb/>of clinical trial designs, such as basket trials, in which eligibility is <lb/>based on mutational status instead of organ site, cancer stage and <lb/>histology 7 . With the advent of basket studies, many oncologists <lb/>now consider that tumor genomic profiling should be offered to all <lb/>patients with cancer who are not candidates for curative-intent local <lb/>or systemic therapy 8 . <lb/>At present, several standalone tests or a panel are typically used to <lb/>capture a set of genomic, transcriptomic or epigenomic features in a <lb/>tumor to inform patient treatment 9 . However, falling costs are making <lb/>whole-genome sequencing (WGS) a potentially attractive proposition <lb/>as a single all-encompassing test to identify cancer drivers and other <lb/>genomic features, which may not be captured by standard testing but <lb/>are clinically actionable 10 . This approach is being explored in the UK by <lb/>the 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP), which is seeking to deliver the <lb/></body>

			<body>Mutation rates varied across the different cancer types with cuta-<lb/>neous melanoma having the highest single nucleotide variant mutation <lb/>count and meningioma the lowest (Extended Data Fig. 2). A total of 945 <lb/>samples, notably colorectal and uterine cancers, were hypermutated, <lb/>either as result of defective mismatch repair (dMMR) or POLE mutation. <lb/>Invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast had the highest power for driver <lb/>gene detection (&gt;90% power for a mutation rate of at least 2% higher <lb/>than background) and large cell lung cancer had the lowest power (Fig. 2 <lb/>and Supplementary Table 4). Compared with the recent Pan-Cancer <lb/>Analysis of Whole Genomes analysis 12 , the 100kGP cohort was better <lb/>powered to identify a driver mutation for 19 cancers, notably for breast, <lb/>colorectal, esophageal and uterine cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and <lb/>bladder transitional cell carcinoma where the sample sizes were more <lb/>than tenfold higher. <lb/>Spectrum of cancer driver genes <lb/>Across all cancer types we identified 770 unique tumor-driver gene <lb/>pairs corresponding to 330 unique candidate cancer driver genes <lb/>(Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5).

Across all cancer <lb/>types we identify 330 candidate driver genes, including 74 which are <lb/>new to any cancer.

			<body>compared to the largest pan-cancer driver analysis, in 21 of 31 cancer <lb/>types where tumor histologies could be matched, we recovered 61% of <lb/>all cancer drivers reported by the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in <lb/>Cancer (COSMIC), the Integrative OncoGenomics (IntOGen) 4 and The <lb/>Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program pan-cancer analysis reported by <lb/>ref. 13 (Supplementary Table 5). We were able to detect 80% of drivers <lb/>reported for colorectal, breast, lung and ovarian cancers but only &lt;20% <lb/>of drivers reported for hepatocellular and stomach cancers, which may <lb/>be a result of differing sample size or intertumour heterogeneity 14 . <lb/>The number of identified cancer driver genes varied between cancer <lb/>types, with colorectal and uterine cancers having the most (60 genes) <lb/>and spindle cell carcinoma having the fewest (4 genes). Across the <lb/>35 cancers, we found no correlation between average mutation bur-<lb/>den and the number of driver genes in each cancer (Pearson&apos;s r = 0.19, <lb/>P = 0.27). The consensus list also includes 326 tumor-driver pairs that <lb/>have not previously been reported by the Cancer Gene Census, IntOGen <lb/>or the pan-cancer analysis of TCGA 4,13 (Supplementary Table 5) and <lb/>74 that have not previously been associated with any specific tissue. <lb/>Almost all of the candidate drivers identified were uncommon, with <lb/>88% (65 of 74) having a mutation frequency &lt;10% in the respective <lb/>cancer type. The highest numbers of new cancer driver genes were <lb/>found for uterine (n = 42), bladder (n = 40) and colorectal (n = 37) can-<lb/>cers. Furthermore, we identified drivers in tumor types which have not <lb/>been cataloged by IntOGen 4 and ref. 13. These include breast lobular <lb/>carcinoma, meningioma and myxofibrosarcoma. Predictions of known <lb/>cancer driver genes in new cancer types include SPTA1, CHD4 and ASXL1 <lb/>in colorectal cancer, FOXO3, MUC16 and ZFPM1 in breast cancers and <lb/>CNTNAP2, CTNND2 and TRRAP in lung adenocarcinoma. Entirely new <lb/>predictions include MAP3K21 (encoding a mixed-lineage kinase) in <lb/>colorectal cancer, USP17L22 (encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme) in <lb/>breast ductal carcinoma and TPTE (encoding a tyrosine phosphatase) <lb/>in lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Table 5). <lb/>Eighty-five genes were identified as a driver in more than two <lb/>tumor types, with 26 genes functioning as drivers in more than five <lb/>tumor types (Fig. 4a). As expected, TP53 was identified as a driver gene <lb/>in the most tumor types, followed by PIK3CA, ARID1A and PTEN, acting <lb/>as cancer driver genes in 29, 18, 16 and 14 different tumor types, respec-<lb/>tively. While many genes function as drivers in several cancer types, <lb/>some drivers are mutated at high frequencies only in specific tumors, <lb/>such as VHL in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and FGFR3 in bladder <lb/>cancer (Fig. 4a). Across drivers operating in several cancer types, the <lb/>clearest examples of domain-specific driver mutations were in EGFR, <lb/>where protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase domain mutations <lb/>predominated in lung adenocarcinoma, in contrast to extracellular <lb/>furin-like cysteine-rich region domain mutations in IDH wild-type <lb/>glioblastoma (Supplementary Table 6 and Extended Data Fig. 4a). <lb/>PIK3CA also showed a preference for p85-binding domain mutations <lb/>in uterine adenocarcinoma compared to other cancer types, such as <lb/>breast ductal carcinoma, which are enriched for mutations in the PIK <lb/>family domain (Supplementary Table 6 and Extended Data Fig. 4b). <lb/>Hierarchical clustering of cancers based on the presence of identified <lb/>driver mutations and their respective q value demonstrated clustering <lb/>of cancer types by cell of origin (for example, head and neck and lung <lb/>squamous cell carcinoma) and by organ (for example, breast ductal <lb/>and lobular carcinomas; Extended Data Fig. 5). The ratio of predicted <lb/>activating versus tumor suppressor driver genes varied across tumor <lb/>types with meningioma and myxofibrosarcoma possessing the highest <lb/>and lowest ratios, respectively (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5). <lb/>Across the 35 different tumor types in 9,070 unique samples we <lb/>identified 12,606 distinct oncogenic mutations in tumor-relevant <lb/>cancer driver genes. The median number of oncogenic mutations in <lb/>cancer driver genes per sample was two, across all tumors. The highest <lb/>median number of oncogenic mutations in driver genes per sample <lb/>was seen in uterine cancer (n = 6; Extended Data Fig. 6). We observed <lb/>significant differences (P binomial &lt; 3.5 Ã 10 -3 ) in oncogenic mutation <lb/>frequency in cancer driver genes across different tumor histologies <lb/>arising from the same organ. Examples include CDH1, TBX3 and TP53 <lb/>in breast cancers, ATRX, CIC, IDH1, PTEN and TP53 in central nervous <lb/>system tumors, IDH1 and TP53 in connective tissue tumors, PBRM1 and <lb/>VHL in renal cancers and EGFR, KMT2D, KRAS, NFE2L2, PTEN, STK11 and <lb/>TP53 in lung cancers (Fig. 5). <lb/>Considering all 330 cancer driver genes, 217 featured at least one <lb/>clonal oncogenic mutation (214 clonal, 167 clonal early and 114 clonal <lb/>late events (Supplementary Table 7). APC, TP53 and PIK3CA possessed <lb/>the most clonal oncogenic mutations (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 7). <lb/>Of the 162 driver genes that harbored at least one subclonal oncogenic <lb/>mutation, ARID1A, TP53 and PIK3CA possessed the most (Fig. 6b and <lb/>Extended Data Fig. 7). Consistent with published work, a high propor-<lb/>tion (55%) of all early clonal driver mutations occur in just four genes <lb/>(TP53, APC, KRAS and PIK3CA) whereas the equivalent percentage of <lb/>late and subclonal oncogenic mutations was observed in 19 different <lb/>genes (Supplementary Table 7) 15-18 . This finding supports a model in <lb/>which early events in cancer evolution tend to occur in a restricted <lb/>set of driver genes and a wider range of drivers feature late in tumor <lb/>evolution. In tumors with more than ten oncogenic mutations, menin-<lb/>gioma exhibited the greatest proportion of clonal oncogenic mutations <lb/>(Extended Data Fig. 8a). Large cell lung, testicular germ cell tumor and <lb/>oligodendroglioma carried the highest proportion of early clonal, late <lb/>clonal and subclonal oncogenic mutations, respectively (Extended <lb/>Data Fig. 8b-d). <lb/>Sensitivity of WGS mutation detection compared to panels <lb/>We initially investigated the performance of WGS to detect clinically <lb/>relevant mutations compared to conventional panel-based testing <lb/>through comparison of mutation calls with Memorial Sloan Kettering <lb/>(MSK) Cancer Center cohorts at 43 established drivers (Supplemen-<lb/>tary Note 1). For primary tumors represented in the MSK and 100kGP <lb/>cohorts, the rate of mutations called for each driver gene was com-<lb/>parable (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Thereafter, we estimated the <lb/>sensitivity of mutation detection in the 100kGP cohort by extracting <lb/>CNS-Oligo <lb/>CNS-Astro <lb/>CNS-GBM-IDHmut <lb/>CNS-GBM-IDHwt <lb/>CNS-GBM-Menin <lb/>Testis-GCT <lb/>BileDuct-AdenoCA <lb/>Bladder-TCC <lb/>Breast-DuctalCA <lb/>Breast-LobularCA <lb/>ColoRect-AdenoCA <lb/>Connective-Chondro <lb/>Connective-Leiomyo <lb/>Connective-Liposarc <lb/>Connective-Myxofibro <lb/>Connective-Osteosarc <lb/>Connective-SCS <lb/>Connective-SS <lb/>Eso-AdenoCA <lb/>HeadNeck-SCC <lb/>Kidney-CCRCC <lb/>Kidney-ChRCC <lb/>Kidney-PRCC <lb/>Liver-HCC <lb/>Lung-AdenoCA <lb/>Lung-LargeCell <lb/>Lung-SCC <lb/>Lung-SmallCell <lb/>Mes-Mesothelioma <lb/>Ovary-AdenoCA <lb/>Panc-AdenoCA <lb/>Prost-AdenoCA <lb/>Skin-Melanoma <lb/>Stomach-AdenoCA <lb/>Uterus-AdenoCA <lb/>100 <lb/>1,000 <lb/>10,000 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>1 <lb/>10 <lb/>100 <lb/>Mutation rate (per Mb) <lb/>Sample size <lb/>Effect size above background <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>Fig. 2 | Power estimates for driver gene identification per tumor type.

			<body>per-tumor coverage across the panel of 43 driver genes (Supplemen-<lb/>tary Note 1). Specifically, for 88% of cancer driver genes, the expected <lb/>sensitivity for mutation detection was &gt;99% in the 100kGP cohort. Fur-<lb/>thermore, for 90% of cancer driver genes, &gt;98% of the coding sequence <lb/>had sufficient coverage such that more than six reads could be used for <lb/>mutation detection after accounting for tumor purity (Supplementary <lb/>Figs. 3-7). These findings are in agreement with published data on the <lb/>diagnostic accuracy of 100kGP WGS compared to panel sequencing <lb/>conducted by Genomics England (sensitivity of 99% for variant allele <lb/>frequency &gt;5% and coverage &gt;70Ã). <lb/>Actionability of driver gene mutations <lb/>We next sought to evaluate the landscape of clinically actionable driver <lb/>alterations through reference to the COSMIC and Precision Oncol-<lb/>ogy Knowledge Base (OncoKB). We observed that both the fraction of <lb/>samples and proportion of alteration types varied across tissue types. <lb/>Data from COSMIC indicated that 85% of all samples (8,880 of 10,478) <lb/>possessed at least one putatively actionable alteration being targeted <lb/>in a clinical setting (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 8), while 55% of <lb/>samples (5,805 of 10,478) had at least one putatively actionable or <lb/>biologically relevant alteration from OncoKB (Fig. 7b and Supplemen-<lb/>tary Tables 9 and 10). Across all cancer types, 15% (1,560 of 10,470) <lb/>of the patients would be eligible for a currently approved therapy as <lb/>defined by OncoKB. Of the actionable mutations defined by OncoKB <lb/>(n = 9,639), 5,823 were clonal, 2,632 were early clonal, 229 were late <lb/>clonal and 852 were subclonal. <lb/>The most common putatively actionable alterations across all of <lb/>the 35 cancer types were mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS and PTEN (Supple-<lb/>mentary Fig. 8). PIK3CA encodes the p110Î± protein, which is a catalytic <lb/>subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Specific oncogenic <lb/>missense mutations in PIK3CA were present in 50% of lobular breast can-<lb/>cers and 38% of ductal breast cancers and their presence is an indication <lb/>for the use of PI3KÎ± inhibitor alpelisib 19 . These mutations are present <lb/>in a number of cancers including colorectal (20%) and uterine cancers <lb/>(47%) and in these tumor types are subject to early clinical studies with <lb/>an allosteric inhibitor of PI3KÎ± 20 .

			<body>or sotorasib 21,22 . PI3KÎ² inhibition is of significant biological interest <lb/>in patients with oncogenic inactivating PTEN mutations, as PI3KÎ² is <lb/>thought to drive cellular proliferation in these tumors. Inactivating <lb/>PTEN mutations were prevalent in melanoma (10%), hepatocellular <lb/>carcinoma (13%), squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (15%), glioblas-<lb/>toma multiforme (29%) and uterine carcinoma (66%) and their presence <lb/>would result in eligibility for early studies of PI3KÎ² inhibition 23 . <lb/>Landscape of clinical actionability <lb/>In addition to actionable mutations in single genes, other classes of <lb/>molecular alterations are recognized as tumor-agnostic biomark-<lb/>ers of drug response. These include mutational profiles caused by <lb/>dMMR/POLE mutations and homologous recombination deficiency <lb/>(HRD), which represent phenotypic markers for response to immu-<lb/>notherapy and PARP inhibition respectively. A total of 319 tumors (3%) <lb/>exhibited a mutational signature for HRD, which provides an indica-<lb/>tion for PARP inhibition therapy and potential sensitivity to platinum <lb/>chemotherapy 24-28 . As demonstrated in our companion paper, the etio-<lb/>logical basis of HRD was, however, only identifiable in 16% of these cases <lb/>based on biallelic inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1 or RAD51B <lb/>through germline and somatic mutations 29 . While other cases may be <lb/>caused by promoter methylation, which could not be assessed because <lb/>these data are not available for 100kGP samples, the findings provide <lb/>a strong rationale for extending the number of patients potentially <lb/>eligible for PARP inhibitors rather than solely relying on BRCA-testing. <lb/>A total of 1,309 tumors possessed a high coding tumor mutational <lb/>burden (more than ten mutations per megabase, Mb) and 144 cancers <lb/>had evidence of dMMR. Considering these collectively would suggest <lb/>that 1,312 patients may be eligible for checkpoint inhibition 30,31 . To <lb/>explore the prospect of several targeted therapies being used in the <lb/>same patient, we combined the OncoKB clinical actionability annota-<lb/>tions with that of TMB, dMMR and HRD clinical actionability annota-<lb/>tions. In total, 11,503 independent unique gene targets were present <lb/>in 6,151 samples with 34% (3,577 of 10,478) of tumors possessing one, <lb/>13% (1,361 of 10,478) two and 12% (1,213 of 10,478) possessing at least <lb/>three clinically actionable driver mutations. <lb/>Expanding the druggable cancer genome <lb/>An opportunity emerging from the systematic analysis of cancer <lb/>genomes is the identification of new therapeutic intervention strate-<lb/>gies. Of the 330 candidate cancer driver genes identified in this study, <lb/>261 (79%) are not currently identified as therapeutic targets in either <lb/>COSMIC or OncoKB databases. As a means of triaging these genes as <lb/>candidates for therapeutic intervention, we assessed the essential-<lb/>ity and selectivity of driver genes and their druggability using RNAi/ <lb/>CRISPR DepMap data and the integrative cancer-focused knowledge-<lb/>base, canSAR, respectively 32,33 . We found 96 of 261 (37%) of these genes <lb/>are predicted to be commonly essential and of these 12 of 96 (13%) <lb/>have a chemical probe available and 35 of 96 (36%) have a ligandable <lb/>three-dimensional (3D) structure (Supplementary Table 11). <lb/>Motivated by the observation that targeting proteins which inter-<lb/>act with cancer driver genes can result in successful precision oncology <lb/>strategies, we sought to expand the network of druggable targets in <lb/>cancer 34,35 . To this end, we used canSAR to map and pharmacologically <lb/>annotate networks of the cancer genes identified for each tumor type. <lb/>Specifically, we seeded networks with driver genes identified in each <lb/>tumor group and used transcriptional and curated protein-protein <lb/>interactions to recover a refined cancer-specific network of proteins, <lb/>Breast_DuctalCA <lb/>Breast_LobularCA <lb/>P value <lb/>P value <lb/>Expected mutation <lb/>rate <lb/>Expected mutation <lb/>rate <lb/>10 -4 <lb/>10 -10 <lb/>10 0 <lb/>10 -1 <lb/>10 -2 <lb/>10 -3 <lb/>10 -4 <lb/>10 -10 <lb/>10 0 <lb/>10 -1 <lb/>10 -2 <lb/>10 -3 <lb/>CNS_Astro <lb/>CNS_GBM_IDHmut <lb/>CNS_GBM_IDHwt <lb/>CNS_Menin <lb/>CNS_Oligo <lb/>Kidney_CCRCC <lb/>Kidney_ChRCC <lb/>Breast <lb/>Kidney <lb/>CNS Connective <lb/>Lung <lb/>Connective_Chondro <lb/>Connective_Leiomyo <lb/>Connective_Liposarc <lb/>Connective_Myxofibro <lb/>Connective_Osteosarc <lb/>Connective_SCS <lb/>Connective_SS <lb/>Lung_AdenoCA <lb/>Lung_LargeCell <lb/>Lung_SCC <lb/>Lung_SmallCell <lb/>Kidney_PRCC <lb/>AKT1 <lb/>ARID1A <lb/>BRCA2 <lb/>CBFB <lb/>CDH1 <lb/>CDKN1B <lb/>CTCF <lb/>ERBB2 <lb/>GATA3 <lb/>FOXA1 <lb/>KMT2C <lb/>KMT2D <lb/>SPEN <lb/>SF3B1 <lb/>RUNX1 <lb/>RB1 <lb/>PTEN <lb/>PIK3R1 <lb/>PIK3CA <lb/>NF1 <lb/>NCOR1 <lb/>MAP3K1 <lb/>MAP2K4 <lb/>PTEN <lb/>PIK3CA <lb/>NF1 <lb/>IDH1 <lb/>EGFR <lb/>CIC <lb/>ATRX <lb/>ZFPM1 <lb/>TP53 <lb/>TBX3 <lb/>RB1 <lb/>TP53 <lb/>IDH1 <lb/>ATRX <lb/>RB1 <lb/>TP53 <lb/>TERT <lb/>ARID1A <lb/>BAP1 <lb/>KDM5C <lb/>MTOR <lb/>PBRM1 <lb/>PTEN <lb/>SETD2 <lb/>TET2 <lb/>TP53 <lb/>VHL <lb/>ARID1A <lb/>ARID2 <lb/>ATM <lb/>BRAF <lb/>CDH10 <lb/>CDKN2A <lb/>CMTR2 <lb/>EGFR <lb/>FAT1 <lb/>FBXW7 <lb/>KEAP1 <lb/>KMT2D <lb/>TP53 <lb/>RB1 <lb/>KRAS <lb/>LRP1B <lb/>MGA <lb/>NF1 <lb/>NFE2L2 <lb/>NOTCH1 <lb/>PIK3CA <lb/>PTEN <lb/>PKHD1L1 <lb/>RASA1 <lb/>RBM10 <lb/>SETD2 <lb/>SMAD4 <lb/>SMARCA4 <lb/>STK11 <lb/>Fig. 5 | Comparison of driver gene somatic mutation rates between tumor <lb/>histologies.

			<body>each protein being annotated on the basis of several assessments of <lb/>&apos;druggability&apos;, that is the likelihood of the protein being amenable to <lb/>small molecule drug intervention. After seeding each cancer-specific <lb/>network with their respective drivers, we yielded a total of 631 distinct <lb/>proteins across all cancers (Supplementary Table 12). The median num-<lb/>ber of unique proteins in each network across all cohorts was 57, with <lb/>colorectal cancer possessing the largest network (n = 231; Extended <lb/>Data Fig. 9) and spindle cell carcinoma possessing the smallest net-<lb/>work (n = 10). As expected there was a correlation between network <lb/>size and number of identified drivers for each cancer type (Pearson&apos;s <lb/>r = 0.9, P = 1.23 Ã 10 -9 ). <lb/>Of these 631 proteins, 58% (n = 369) were retrieved solely through <lb/>network analysis, of which most (n = 323) were not formally identified <lb/>as candidate driver genes in any cancer type (hereafter referred to as <lb/>cancer-network proteins). Notable examples include HDAC1, CDK2 <lb/>and CDK1, which were present in 31, 29 and 28 cohorts, respectively. <lb/>We observed 70% (n = 225) of these cancer-network proteins as being <lb/>targetable by existing approved or investigational therapies, with <lb/>notable examples including BCL2 and BTK. Of the remaining 97 genes, <lb/>34 are commonly essential, 11 possess concordant lineage specificity, <lb/>48 are ligandable by 3D structure and 11 have an existing high-quality <lb/>probe available (Supplementary Table 13). Collectively these data <lb/>provide potential future opportunities for therapy for several cancers. <lb/>For example, CDC5L, a core component of the Prp19 (hPrp19)/Cdc5L <lb/>pre-RNA splicing complex, is part of the melanoma cancer protein <lb/>network 36 . This protein is predicted to be commonly essential with <lb/>lineage specificity and has a 3D ligandable structure. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Clinical and laboratory observations have led to the recognition <lb/>that genomic profiling of tumors is increasingly important for the <lb/>management of patients with cancers 37 . To explore the value of WGS <lb/>to precision oncology we have analysed WGS data on 10,470 patients <lb/>recruited to the 100kGP study. <lb/>Across all cancers, we identified 330 cancer driver genes, 74 of <lb/>which are new to any cancer type. The candidate driver gene list is <lb/>limited by focusing on point mutations and small indels without <lb/>consideration of copy-number alterations, genomic fusions or meth-<lb/>ylation events. Nevertheless, we believe it represents one of the most <lb/>comprehensive efforts thus far to identify cancer driver genes and <lb/>serves as an important research asset. The similarities and differences <lb/>in driver mutation frequencies in cancers arising from the same organ <lb/>imply both shared and divergent pathways in oncogenesis. Notably, <lb/>however, many driver mutations are common across several differ-<lb/>ent tumor types. If clinically translated, these observations suggest <lb/>that currently 55% of patients&apos; tumors harbor a potentially actionable <lb/>mutation, either in terms of predicting sensitivity to certain treat-<lb/>ments or clinical trial eligibility. This contrasts with 22% achievable <lb/>if based on the current small variant testing panels in widespread <lb/>use 38 . Although our assumption is predicated on approved drugs as <lb/>a proxy for effective cancer therapies, a recent study of cancer drug <lb/>approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded <lb/>that new cancer drug approvals reduce the risk of death and tumor <lb/>progression 39 . To inform potential future therapeutic opportunities, <lb/>we applied established chemogenomic technologies to map and <lb/>pharmacologically annotate the cellular network of cancer genes <lb/>identified by WGS. Through annotation of cellular networks with <lb/>measures of essentiality and selectivity, we were able to highlight <lb/>additional potential therapeutic targets in cancer. It is likely that such <lb/>endeavors will be improved by exploiting emergent high-throughput <lb/>reporter assays to assess the functional consequences of somatic <lb/>driver mutations in greater detail 40 . <lb/>a <lb/>b <lb/>ARID1A <lb/>ATM <lb/>BCL9L <lb/>CREBBP <lb/>CTNNB1 <lb/>FBXW7 <lb/>INPPL1 <lb/>KMT2C <lb/>MGA <lb/>NF1 <lb/>PIK3CA <lb/>PIK3R1 <lb/>PSPC1 <lb/>PTEN <lb/>RB1 <lb/>RNF43 <lb/>SMAD4 <lb/>ZFHX3 <lb/>ZFP36L2 <lb/>TP53 <lb/>0 <lb/>25 <lb/>50 <lb/>75 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>Total number of subclonal oncogenic mutations in a <lb/>cancer driver gene <lb/>Proportion of oncogenic mutations in a cancer driver <lb/>gene that are subclonal (%) <lb/>APC <lb/>KRAS <lb/>APC <lb/>ARID1A <lb/>ATM <lb/>BRAF <lb/>KRAS <lb/>NF1 <lb/>PIK3CA <lb/>PIK3R1 <lb/>PTEN <lb/>TP53 <lb/>VHL <lb/>0 <lb/>25 <lb/>50 <lb/>75 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>1,000 <lb/>2,000 <lb/>3,000 <lb/>Total number of clonal oncogenic mutations in a <lb/>cancer driver gene <lb/>Proportion of oncogenic mutations in a cancer driver <lb/>gene that are clonal (%) <lb/>Fig. 6 | Distribution of clonal and subclonal oncogenic mutations in candidate <lb/>cancer driver genes. a, Distribution of clonal oncogenic mutations in candidate <lb/>cancer driver genes across all cancer types: y axis, percentage of all clonal <lb/>oncogenic mutations of all oncogenic mutations; x axis, total number of clonal <lb/>oncogenic mutations.

			<body>which potentially impacts on the generalizability of our findings to <lb/>worldwide populations 42,43 . <lb/>Accepting these limitations, our observations indicate that, <lb/>depending on cancer type, approximately 15% of patients are poten-<lb/>tially eligible for a currently approved therapy targeting an oncogenic <lb/>driver. Our discovery analysis, however, implies that far more patients <lb/>may potentially be candidates for a therapy targeting a driver mutation <lb/>or pathway. A long-standing criticism of precision oncology is that <lb/>often its proponents overstate the clinical actionability of individual <lb/>genes or genomic variants 44 . Mutations that are clinically validated and <lb/>FDA-recognized as predictive biomarkers of drug response are often <lb/>grouped together as clinically actionable, with such mutations poten-<lb/>tially erroneously identified as the putative basis for outlier exceptional <lb/>responses. To better communicate the strength of evidence support-<lb/>ing the clinical actionability of individual mutant alleles, many variant <lb/>knowledge bases stratify genomic alterations on the basis of the level <lb/>of clinical and/or biological data supporting their use as a predictive <lb/>biomarker of drug response or resistance. Here, we have sought to <lb/>address such concerns by making use of well-curated resources to <lb/>assign actionability to driver mutations. Specifically, we have queried <lb/>knowledge databases which are regularly curated by an expert panel <lb/>and are therefore recognized to reflect the current state of knowledge 31 . <lb/>While the 100kGP was predicated on delivering diagnostic tests <lb/>for well-established actionable mutations in NHS cancer patients with <lb/>high sensitivity, concern has been raised over missing well-recognized <lb/>clinically actionable mutations 45 . In our analysis the frequency of estab-<lb/>lished cancer-specific oncogenic drivers recovered was, however, <lb/>comparable to MSK-IMPACT and MSK-MET 6,9 . Moreover, the sensitivity <lb/>of 100Ã WGS to identify mutations was high even for samples with low <lb/>tumor purity (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. 3-7). <lb/>A barrier to the broader success of precision oncology paradigms <lb/>may be the many &apos;undruggable&apos; oncogenic mutations coupled with the <lb/>fact that targeting downstream effectors typically fails to demonstrate <lb/>the levels of clinical efficacy of drugs that directly inhibit the mutated <lb/>oncoprotein. Recent developments in protein structure prediction, <lb/>new degraders, covalent inhibition and allosteric protein domain <lb/>maps seek to unlock these &apos;undruggable&apos; proteins 46-49 . Furthermore, <lb/>WGS allows for the extension of analyses beyond the consideration of <lb/>individual genetic alterations, thereby affording a clinically significant <lb/>benefit over targeted panel sequencing assays. Mutational signatures <lb/>associated with dMMR and HRD are increasingly being shown to be <lb/>clinically relevant to defining responsiveness to immunotherapy and <lb/>PARP inhibition, respectively 24,30 . Additionally, there is increasing <lb/>evidence that other signatures reflecting the DNA repair capacity of <lb/>cancer cells are predictive of drug responsiveness to other agents 5,50 . A <lb/>more detailed discussion and comprehensive description of all classes <lb/>of mutational signatures observed across the 100kGP are reported in <lb/>our companion paper 29 . The ability to robustly characterize mutational <lb/>signatures may therefore prove to be a major clinically significant <lb/>incremental benefit of WGS over targeted panel sequencing assays. <lb/>Moreover, the provision of WGS is likely to play a greater role in patient <lb/>management given that T cell-based therapies are of increasing impor-<lb/>tance and in silico approaches are now used to predict the presence of <lb/>immunogenic tumor-specific neoantigens from WGS 51-54 . <lb/>Despite the merits of WGS as a one-stop clinical assay, its wider <lb/>adoption outside selected academic and commercial centers has been <lb/>limited 37 . A great hurdle is that the tumor material available for many <lb/>patients is of insufficient quantity, quality or purity for these broader <lb/>sequencing platforms. Indeed, in the 100kGP the lack of access to fresh <lb/>frozen samples (and/or those of sufficient quantity) precluded the <lb/>analysis of tumors from many patients 11 . In designing clinical assays, <lb/>the limitations imposed by cost and sequencing capacity require the <lb/>balancing of sequencing breadth and depth 41 . At present, the higher <lb/>coverage of targeted assays represents an advantage over WGS for <lb/>detection of alterations in genes clinically validated as biomarkers of <lb/>drug response, especially in samples with poor DNA quality or high stro-<lb/>mal contamination. A wider adoption of WGS will require further reduc-<lb/>tions in sequencing costs and technological improvements to enable <lb/>the use of lower-quality, archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <lb/>tumor tissue 55 . Any such developments will have to address the issue <lb/>that formalin fixation adversely affects DNA quality and the ability to <lb/>reliably call variants from WGS data, even when using bioinformatic <lb/>correction 41,56,57 . Aside from such technical issues there are also inher-<lb/>ent limitations to short-read WGS. Notably, structural variants cannot <lb/>be robustly called, with low concordance being a feature of present <lb/>implemented algorithms 58,59 . It is likely that this limitation will only be <lb/>addressed by adoption of long-read sequencing, albeit presently this <lb/>incurs a high requirement for DNA and further cost, thus restricting its <lb/>use in the diagnostic setting 60 . The continued decline in sequencing <lb/>costs and the identification of new genomic biomarkers predictive of <lb/>drug response have driven the rapid adoption of multigene profiling <lb/>of patients as a component of routine cancer care. As our analysis indi-<lb/>cates, the future adoption of WGS or broader panels has the potential to <lb/>enable more accurate assessments of the driver mutational landscape <lb/>predictive of drug response. <lb/>Online content <lb/>Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting sum-<lb/>maries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, <lb/>acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contri-<lb/>butions and competing interests; and statements of data and code avail-<lb/>ability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01785-9. <lb/></body>

		<div type="annex">Methods <lb/>The 100kGP cohort <lb/>The analysed cohort comprised tumor-normal sample pairs from <lb/>patients with primary cancers recruited to 100kGP (v.11 release) <lb/>through 13 Genomic Medicine Centers across England (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. 9). Genomics England has obtained written informed consent from <lb/>all participants. We restricted our analysis to high-quality sequencing <lb/>data derived from PCR-free, flash-frozen primary solid tumor samples <lb/>from 10,470 adults (34 bile duct, 305 bladder, 2,306 breast, 2,324 colo-<lb/>rectal, 440 central nervous system, 91 esophageal, 201 head and neck, <lb/>1,045 renal cell, 24 liver, 1,110 lung, 35 mesothelioma, 607 soft tissue, <lb/>454 ovarian, 94 pancreas, 366 prostate, 270 melanoma, 72 gastric, 51 <lb/>testicular and 649 uterus) (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Comprehensive <lb/>clinicopathology information on the patients is provided in Supple-<lb/>mentary Table 3 and complete details on sample curation, tumor purity <lb/>per cancer type (Extended Data Fig. 10), WGS, somatic variant calling, <lb/>mutation annotation and power calculations are provided in Supple-<lb/>mentary Note 1. We identified mutational signatures associated with <lb/>dMMR and HRD in tumors using SigProfilerExtractor complemented <lb/>by mSINGS and HRDetect (Supplementary Note 1) 29,61,62 . <lb/>Identification and timing of driver genes <lb/>Cancer driver genes for each of the tumor types were identified <lb/>using the IntOGen pipeline (Supplementary Note 1) 4 . We examined <lb/>the sensitivity of WGS in the 100kGP cohort to detect mutations in <lb/>well-established driver genes based on sample purity and gene cover-<lb/>age and by comparing the call rates of panel sequencing reported in <lb/>the Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and <lb/>Metastatic Events and Tropisms studies of cancer conducted by the <lb/>MSK Cancer Center (Supplementary Note 1) 6,63 . The relative evolu-<lb/>tionary timings of candidate driver mutations were obtained using <lb/>MutationTimeR (Supplementary Note 1) 15 . <lb/>Actionability of driver gene mutations and networks <lb/>We first queried the OncoKB and COSMIC Mutation Actionability in <lb/>Precision Oncology Product databases to evaluate the therapeutic <lb/>implications of genetic events 31,64 . Both databases catalog approved <lb/>marketed drugs having demonstrated efficacy in tumors with specified <lb/>driver gene mutations, based on clinical trials and published clinical <lb/>evidence. OncoKB also provides compelling biological evidence sup-<lb/>porting the cancer driver gene as being predictive of a response to a <lb/>given drug. <lb/>To undertake a chemogenic analysis of cancer networks for each <lb/>cancer type, we used protein products of the cancer driver genes to <lb/>seed a search for all interacting proteins in the canSAR interactome 33 , <lb/>which is based on information from eight databases, including the <lb/>IMeX consortium 65 , Phosphosite 66 and key publications. We annotated <lb/>proteins with pharmacological and druggability data using canSAR&apos;s <lb/>Cancer Protein Annotation Tool. Essential and selective genes including <lb/>lineage specificity were ascertained from the ShinyDepMap analysis <lb/>server (Supplementary Note 1) 32 . <lb/>Reporting summary <lb/>Further information on research design is available in the Nature <lb/>Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">nature portfolio | reporting summary <lb/>April 2023 <lb/>Life sciences study design <lb/>All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative. <lb/>Sample size <lb/>10,478 samples were included in the full cohort. Exact sample sizes for tumour groups are provided in supplementary table 2. Sample size was <lb/>chosen based on the availability of whole genome sequencing of tumour/normal pairs in the Genomics England research environment. <lb/>Data exclusions A detailed description of the sample quality control is provided in the methods. Supplementary table 1 provides information on how many <lb/>samples were excluded. Sequenced tumour samples were excluded if clinical data were missing or if unresolvable conflicts existed between <lb/>the clinical data sources (GMCs, NHSD, PHE-NCRAS, histology reports). In total 2,251/14,129 (15.9%) of tumour samples were excluded based <lb/>on availability and consistency of reported sex, tumour histology, tumour type, sampling date or if the participant was recorded as less than <lb/>18 years old at the time of sampling. 267/11878 (2.2%) of tumour samples with required clinical data available were excluded based on <lb/>tumour sample purity and sequencing data quality. Duplicate tumour samples were also removed, to ensure that no individual was <lb/>represented more than once in a tumour group. If multiple sequenced tumour samples from the same tumour group were available for an <lb/>individual, we preferentially kept primary tumour samples with highest purity. Non-solid tumours were removed from this analysis. Based on <lb/>these criteria, 10,478 tumour samples were suitable for analysis. <lb/>Replication <lb/>This study has an observational rather than an experimental study design, and only one sample was sequenced from each participant, in the <lb/>great majority of cases. We replicate many of the findings from previously published studies of somatic cancer driver genes. <lb/>Randomization This study has an observational rather than an experimental study design hence randomisation of study participants is not relevant. <lb/>Blinding <lb/>This study used real-world observation data collected from NHS trusts. The investigators did not have control over sample selection, collection <lb/>and processing and as such blinding is not relevant to this study. <lb/>Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods <lb/>We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, <lb/>system or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response. <lb/>Materials &amp; experimental systems <lb/>n/a Involved in the study <lb/>Antibodies <lb/>Eukaryotic cell lines <lb/>Palaeontology and archaeology <lb/>Animals and other organisms <lb/>Clinical data <lb/>Dual use research of concern <lb/>Plants <lb/>Methods <lb/>n/a Involved in the study <lb/>ChIP-seq <lb/>Flow cytometry <lb/>MRI-based neuroimaging <lb/>Novel plant genotypes <lb/>Describe the methods by which all novel plant genotypes were produced. This includes those generated by transgenic approaches, <lb/>gene editing, chemical/radiation-based mutagenesis and hybridization. For transgenic lines, describe the transformation method, the <lb/>number of independent lines analyzed and the generation upon which experiments were performed. For gene-edited lines, describe <lb/>the editor used, the endogenous sequence targeted for editing, the targeting guide RNA sequence (if applicable) and how the editor <lb/>was applied. <lb/>Seed stocks <lb/>Report on the source of all seed stocks or other plant material used. If applicable, state the seed stock centre and catalogue number. If <lb/>plant specimens were collected from the field, describe the collection location, date and sampling procedures. <lb/>Authentication <lb/>Describe any authentication procedures for each seed stock used or novel genotype generated. Describe any experiments used to <lb/>assess the effect of a mutation and, where applicable, how potential secondary effects (e.g. second site T-DNA insertions, mosiacism, <lb/>off-target gene editing) were examined. <lb/>Plants </div>
