			<front>Abstract <lb/>Precision medicine might be the response to the recent questioning of the use of metformin as an <lb/>anticancer drug in colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, in order to establish properly its benefits, its <lb/>application need to be assayed on the different progression stages of CRC. In this way, organoids <lb/>imply a more physiological tool, representing a new therapeutic opportunity for CRC <lb/>personalized treatment to assay tumor stage-dependent drugs effects. Since the lipid metabolism-<lb/>related axis, ACSL/SCD, stimulates colon cancer progression and Metformin is able to rescuing <lb/>the invasive and migratory phenotype conferred to cancer cells upon this axis overexpression; we <lb/>checked ACSL/SCD status, its regulatory miRNAs and the effect of Metformin treatment in <lb/>organoids as a model for specific and personalized treatment. Despite ACSL4 expression is <lb/>upregulated in CRC-like organoids, Metformin is able to downregulate it, especially in the first <lb/>stages. Besides, organoids are clearly more sensitive in this first stage (Apc mutated) to <lb/>Metformin than current chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil (5-FU). Metformin performs <lb/>an independent &quot;Warburg effect&quot; blockade to cancer progression and is able to reduce crypt stem <lb/>cell markers expression such as Lgr5+. These results suggest a putative increased efficiency of <lb/>the use of Metformin in the first stages of CRC than in advanced disease. <lb/>Keywords: CRC-like organoids, colorectal cancer, ACSL/SCD axis, lipid metabolism, acyl-CoA <lb/>synthetases, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase, Metformin, LGR5+, non-Warburg metabolism, <lb/>personalized medicine. <lb/>Abbreviations: ACSL1: Acyl-CoA synthetase 1; ACSL4: Acyl-CoA synthetase 4; CRC: <lb/>Colorectal cancer; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; 5-FU: Fluorouracil; MiRNAs/ miR: <lb/>MicroRNAs; MTT: 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; OAA: <lb/>Oxaloacetate; SCD: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase; TCA: Tricarboxylic Acid cycle; 2D: 2-<lb/>dimensional; 3D: 3-dimensional. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men (10% of the total), after lung <lb/>and prostate cancer, and the second in women (9.2% of the total), after breast cancer [1]. Most of <lb/>the CRC cases are sporadic (70-80%), which consists of the acquisition of somatic mutations and <lb/>in which there is no family history or genetic predisposition. The remaining cases (20-30%) are <lb/>those among close relatives, which are divided into inherited or familial CRC, [2]. Genetically, <lb/>sporadic CRC development is due to the abnormalities accumulation in tumor suppressor genes <lb/>and oncogenes [3,3]. Previous research postulated the adenoma-carcinoma transition theory, in <lb/>which specific somatic mutations promoting tumorigenesis are acquired; proposed by Fearon and <lb/>Vogelstein (Vogelgram). The Vogelgram proposes that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence model <lb/>would start with loss of the APC gene, followed by mutations in KRAS or BRAF genes, mutations <lb/>or loss of TP53 gene and of SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) [4]. <lb/>Over the last decade, the interest in metabolic research with respect to cancer has been <lb/>expansively increased. The first and most characterized tumor metabolism event to be described <lb/>is the exacerbated glucose uptake and glycolysis utilization; which even in normoxic condition, <lb/>are not used for maximal ATP generation via mitochondrial respiration. This phenomenon is <lb/>denoted as the &quot;Warburg effect&quot;. <lb/>Even though lipid-associated pathways are functionally dependent on glucose and glutamine <lb/>catabolic pathways, are now a well-recognized and frequently described cancer metabolic feature <lb/>with a key role in their tumorigenesis. This is the case for the ACSL/SCD axis [5], a lipid <lb/>metabolism-related network described to promote tumorigenesis through an epithelial-<lb/>mesenchymal transition (EMT) program that promotes migration and invasion of colon cancer <lb/>cells. The mesenchymal phenotype produced upon overexpression of these enzymes is reverted <lb/>through reactivation of AMPK signaling performed by the well-known anti-diabetic drug, <lb/>Metformin. Though its mechanism of action is not fully understood, Metformin has shown a <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>robust anti-proliferative effect on several types of cancer such as colon, pancreatic, breast, <lb/>ovarian, prostate and lung cancer cells [6]. Furthermore, Metformin has been recently associated <lb/>with improved survival of cancer patients, including CRC, though its use as an antitumoral agent <lb/>has not been established yet [7] <lb/>The ACSL/SCD axis pro-tumorigenic activity has been also described to be post-transcriptionally <lb/>regulated by miRNAs. miR-544a, miR-142, and miR-19b-1 has been proposed as major <lb/>regulators of the ACSL/SCD network and the miR-19b-1-3p isoform decreased expression <lb/>associated with a poorer survival rate in CRC patients, consistently with ACSL/SCD involvement <lb/>in patients relapse [8]. <lb/>To get insight into the metabolic implication on CRC progression with a special focus on the <lb/>ACSL/SCD axis and the effect of metformin in each case, more personalized and physiological <lb/>tools are needed since most of the available data rely on traditional studies using cancer cell lines <lb/>cultures. In this way, the organoid culture system opens a new methodological door for ex vivo <lb/>studies. <lb/>Adult tissue-derived epithelial organoids, also called &quot;mini guts&quot; [9] are stereotypic tissue-like <lb/>structures derived from digestive healthy tissues or tumors which mimics in vitro the tissue <lb/>composition and morphology of their in vivo counterparts [10]. This methodology was first <lb/>established in long-term primary culture from mouse small intestinal crypts to generate epithelial <lb/>organoids with crypt-and villus-like epithelial domains representing both progenitor and <lb/>differentiated cells [11]. <lb/>The organoids technology takes advantage of the intestinal epithelium self-renewing capacity. <lb/>Organoids starts from LGR5+ gut epithelial stem cells forming symmetric cyst structures, which <lb/>finally will form budding structures resembling intestinal crypts. These budding structures are <lb/>formed by these LGR5+ stem cells flanked by differentiated daughter cells [9]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Organoids are currently employed in colorectal cancer studies and chemotherapy assessment <lb/>[12,13]. Along with intestinal organoids, similar epithelial organoids culture conditions for other <lb/>mouse and human digestive epithelial tissues have been also adapted [14-17] including tumor-<lb/>derived organoids from cancer patients. Importantly, organoids grow as pure epithelial cultures <lb/>without any contamination of vessels, immune cells or non-transformed mesenchymal which <lb/>leads to an accurate sequencing or expression profiling [10]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and Methods <lb/>CRC-like organoids: culture and maintenance <lb/>Mice: Mutant intestinal murine organoids were obtained from the Universitätsklinikum Carl <lb/>Gustav Carus, Dresden. All procedures involving animals were conducted strictly in accordance <lb/>with FELASA regulations and approved by the animal welfare committees of the Technische <lb/>Universität Dresden and the Landesdirektion Sachsen prior to initiation of the experiments. <lb/>Mice with conditional mutations in Apc, Kras, Tp53 and Smad4 were obtained from the NCI <lb/>Mouse Repository (Apc, Kras Tp53) or the Jackson Laboratory (Smad4) and interbred to obtain <lb/>compound mutant mice (Table 1). The CRC-like organoid model represents the adenoma-<lb/>carcinoma sequence with the most common acquired mutations in a sporadic CRC: APC fl/fl , <lb/>KRAS G12D/WT , P53 R172H/WT and Smad4 fl/fl (corresponding to stages I to IV) (Table 2).

			<body>Murine organoids mutagenesis is conditioned by the Cre/loxP system. Adenoviral infections <lb/>were performed as explained in [18] to provide active mutations. <lb/>Crypt isolation and organoid culture: Crypts were isolated from the murine small <lb/>intestine by incubation for 30 min at 4°C in PBS containing 2 mM EDTA as previously reported <lb/>[11,19]. Isolated crypts were seeded in Matrigel (Corning® Matrigel® Matrix). The basic culture <lb/>medium (Advanced Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle Medium DMEM/F12 complemented with <lb/>penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1x Glutamax [Gibco], named ADF +++) was <lb/>supplemented with: 100 ng/ml Noggin (Peprotech), R-spondin (conditioned medium, 10% final <lb/>volume), 1x B27 (Invitrogen), 1x N2 (Invitrogen), 1,25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), <lb/>100 μg/mL Primocin TM (InvivoGen) and 50 ng/mL mEGF (Thermofisher). The complete media <lb/>is named supplemented ADF +++ media. For passaging, organoids were removed from Matrigel <lb/>and mechanically dissociated with a glass pipette, pelleted and then transferred to fresh Matrigel <lb/>[11,14,20]. Splitting was performed twice a week in a 1:3 split ratio. Cultures were kept at 37 °C, <lb/>5% CO2 in humidity. <lb/>Drugs treatment -viability assays <lb/>Cell viability was determined by counting and seeding 1000 crypts in 60% of Matrigel in 48-well <lb/>plates. After 2 days of culture, organoids were exposed 48 hours to 10 µM Metformin (Sigma) or <lb/>10, 100 or 150 µM 5-FU (Sigma) in supplemented ADF +++ media, as indicated in the figures. <lb/>At this point, organoids were collected, split and reseeded for recovery experiments over 72 hours <lb/>in supplemented ADF +++ media. <lb/>Upon treatments (48h) or recovery assays (post-72h), organoids were incubated 3 hours with 3-<lb/>(4,5-dimethyl-thyazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT, Sigma). After discarding the media, <lb/>20 μl of 2% SDS (Sigma) solution in H2O was added to solubilize Matrigel (2 h, 37 °C). The <lb/></body>

The absorbance was <lb/>measured on the microplate reader (Asys UVM 340, Isogen life science) at 562 nm. <lb/>Untreated organoids were defined as 100% viable. Data were expressed as the fold change of <lb/>viable cells from treated organoids compared to the non-treated organoids. <lb/>RNA isolation and RT-QPCR <lb/>For RNA isolation, organoids were released from Matrigel (Corning) with cold Dispase (Corning) <lb/>and pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and pelleted organoids were <lb/>carefully resuspended in Trizol (Qiagen), and storage at -80ºC. RNA was isolated according to <lb/>the supplier&apos;s protocol (Invitrogen) and the concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio) were <lb/>determined by spectrophotometric analysis (NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer <lb/>ThermoScientific). 20 ng/μl RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity RNA-to-<lb/>cDNA kit (ThermoFisher), according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Relative gene expression <lb/>was measured using VeriQuest Fast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Isogen). Primers used <lb/>are listed in S1 Table. Regarding miRNAs, their expression was monitored using TaqMan® <lb/>MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Taq-man miRNA probes for <lb/>RT-qPCR (S2 Table). RT-QPCRs were performed on the QuantStudio 12K Flex (Applied <lb/>Biosystems) and the 2 -ΔΔCt method was applied to calculate the relative gene or miRNA <lb/>expression. <lb/>L-Lactate quantification <lb/>Organoids were seeded at a density of 1000 crypts per well in a 48-well plate. After 48 hours, the <lb/>medium was changed to PBS, 10 mM of Metformin or 10 µM 5-FU in supplemented ADF +++ <lb/>media overnight at 37°C before quantification. Using Cayman&apos;s Glycolysis cell-based assay <lb/>(Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, 600450) extracellular L-Lactate was measured by determining <lb/>absorbance at 490 nm. L-Lactate measurements (mM) were normalized to total protein <lb/>concentration (mg) x100. <lb/></body>

			<body>Metformin action is stronger on ACSL4 and SCD <lb/>overexpressing first stages organoids <lb/>Since stage I organoids seemed to present a differential sensitivity to metformin compared to <lb/>other stages, together with a differential expression of ACSL4, we aimed to analyze the possible <lb/>link between Metformin and ACSL/SCD axis in intestinal organoids. <lb/>To this aim, ACSL4 expression was measured, as well as the other enzymes of the ACSL/SCD <lb/>metabolic network (ACSL1 and SCD) upon 10 µM Metformin treatment. ACSL4 mRNA <lb/>expression was strongly reduced by this drug compared to their non-treated controls in stage I and <lb/>II organoids. By contrast, stage III and IV presented no significance in their reduction or a slight <lb/>significance, respectively. WT organoids also presented a slight reduction of ACSL4 mRNA upon <lb/>Metformin treatment (Fig 4B). In addition, SCD expression levels were clearly decreased by <lb/>Metformin in WT and stage I organoids, while a less marked tendency was found for stage III <lb/>and IV organoids (Fig 4C). ACSL1 mRNA analysis showed less significant results (Fig 4A) upon <lb/>Metformin treatment. <lb/>Figure 4: Metformin action is stronger on ACSL4 and SCD overexpressing first stages <lb/>organoids and downregulates stem cell biomarker LGR5 and Wnt target genes expression <lb/>in all organoid stages. <lb/>mRNA expression levels of enzymes related to the ACSL/SCD axis, ACSL4 (A), SCD (B), by <lb/>RT-QPCR; and expression levels of different stem cell markers, Lgr5 (C), Axin-2 (D) and Ctnnb-<lb/>1 (E) by RT-QPCR upon PBS (black bars) and 10 uM Metformin (yellow bars).

			<body>differences were showed between the effects in initial and later stages such as the case for <lb/>Metformin treatment (S5A-C Figs). <lb/>Metformin, but not 5-FU, downregulates stem cell biomarker <lb/>LGR5 and Wnt target genes expression in all organoid stages <lb/>To further assay whether Metformin treatment was targeting the organoids crypts stem cell <lb/>marker, LGR5; we analyzed its expression together with two other Wnt target genes, Axin2 and <lb/>Ctnnb-1. Importantly, LGR5 expression was significantly diminished in the whole CRC-like <lb/>organoids series upon Metformin treatment (Fig 4C) as well as Axin-2 (Fig 4D) and Ctnnb-1 (Fig <lb/>4E) mRNAs. Surprisingly, this pattern was not maintained when organoids were treated with 10 <lb/>µM 5-FU (S5D-F Figs). <lb/>Metformin action in CRC-like organoids is not related to a <lb/>Warburg-effect impairement <lb/>The avidity to perform glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, known as the Warburg effect, <lb/>is one of the hallmarks of tumors. For this reason, we measured the levels of L-lactate, the end <lb/>product of glycolysis. CRC-like organoids presented increased glycolysis compared to WT <lb/>organoids, reflecting an increasing Warburg effect throughout the stages, as expected. Even <lb/>though 5-FU treatment caused a slight decrease in the glycolytic performance of the mutant <lb/>organoids (Fig 5), Metformin treatment caused an opposite effect, increasing the glycolytic <lb/>capacity in all stages, especially in stage I, the most sensitive to the drug. Thus, it seems that <lb/>Metformin effect on CRC-like organoids viability relies in mechanisms other than preventing pro-<lb/>tumorigenic Warburg effect, likely through the regulation of lipid metabolism. <lb/>Figure 5: Metformin action in CRC organoids is not related to a Warburg-effect <lb/>impairement <lb/>Bars represent the extracellular L-lactate production upon overnight PBS treatment (black bars), <lb/>Metformin treatment (yellow bars) and 5-FU treatment (grey bars) using the Cayman&apos;s Glycolysis <lb/>cell-based assay.

(ns, P&gt; 0.05; *, P ≤ <lb/>0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Organoids seem to represent a good tool to study lipid metabolism [22] and previous studies <lb/>employing intestinal organoids have linked the critical role of fatty acid metabolism to the <lb/>intestinal epithelial integrity in vivo [23]. Therefore, we propose this system to get insight into <lb/>cancer progression mechanisms in regards to fatty acid metabolism and therefore, to assay <lb/>ACSL/SCD protumorigenic axis action in CRC. <lb/>We showed that ACSL4 augmented while miR-19b-1-3p diminished its expression, both <lb/>progressively, in murine CRC-like organoids. Metformin action compared to the <lb/>chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU, in terms of viability reduction, was similar; although no significant <lb/>reduction was found in WT organoids viability with any treatment. Stage I organoids were the <lb/>most susceptible to Metformin action compared to 5-FU; while further stages presented similar <lb/>or stronger sensitivity to 5-FU, including WT organoids. Besides, Metformin was able to reduce <lb/>the intestinal crypt stem cell marker LGR5 in all the stages, together with two other Wnt <lb/>downstream targets, Ctnnb-1 and Axin-2. Finally, we showed that even though the CRC-<lb/>organoids series present a growing Warburg effect through the stages consistent with increased <lb/>L-lactate levels; Metformin action on CRC organoids viability was not related to an ablation of <lb/>Warburg effect. <lb/>The individual role of ACSL isoform 1 [24,25] and 4 [24,26] as well as SCD [27-31] in CRC has <lb/>been extensively reported. Surprisingly, while ACSL4 mRNA levels are clearly increased through <lb/>the stages in this organoids model, this was not the case for ACSL1, and SCD was only <lb/>overexpressed in advanced stages. These results differ from previous ones using human CRC cells <lb/></body>

			<body>which can be due to differential expression in murine tissues compared to human 2D cultures [5] <lb/>[8]. Nevertheless, the use of murine organoids allows their genetic engineering and to accurately <lb/>control the mutations for a better mechanistic characterization, rather than patient tumor-derived <lb/>biopsies with the high variability that each tumor represent. Thus, our CRC model mimics a <lb/>sporadic colorectal tumor with the common mutations acquired during the progression of this <lb/>cancer. Due to the organoids results, the overexpression of the three enzymes could be only <lb/>present in some punctual tumors. However, the overexpression of ACSL4 is preserved in murine <lb/>organoids with the acquired CRC most common mutations (Fig 1A), indicating a predominant <lb/>role of this ACSL/SCD component in these cancer progression aspects. The ACSL4 mRNA huge <lb/>range of expression considering the most mutated stages (Fig 1A) could be explained since stages <lb/>III and IV in real tumors present an uncontrolled genetic variability with the accumulation of <lb/>other undetermined mutations. Organoids would be mimicking these uncontrolled stages, <lb/>compared to the homogeneity presented in 2D cultures. Conversely, ACSL1 static role (S1A Fig) <lb/>could be due to a lesser implication in tumor development in this system which can be also <lb/>explained by the fact that the rodent protein is one residue longer (699 amino acids) than the <lb/>human protein (698 amino acids), making it necessary to study the extent of this dissimilarity. <lb/>For its part, SCD overexpression has been mainly reported in mesenchymal tissues, rather than <lb/>epithelial ones, which are the only scaffold for organoids [32,33] giving a reason for the <lb/>distinctive results found in these epithelial systems among the first stages (S1B Fig). <lb/>Regarding miRs expression, miR-19b-1-3p kept its tumor-suppressor role in murine CRC-like <lb/>organoids, also reported as a good prognosis miRNA, able to target the axis [8]. The immature <lb/>isoform of miR-19b-1-3p, miR-19b, and other members of the miR-17-92 cluster, where this <lb/>miRNA is involved, regulate the self-renewal ability of gastric cancer stem cells [34]. The miR-<lb/>17-92 cluster role is controversial and dependent on the cancer type [35,36]. However, it is <lb/>interesting the reported role of this miRNA in digestive cancer stem cells, and its role in CRC <lb/>stem cells may be a potential line of research henceforth. In line with our results, miR-19b was <lb/>also reported to downregulate suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOC3), modulating chemokine <lb/></body>

			<body>production in intestinal epithelial cells and thereby avoiding intestinal inflammation in Crohn&apos;s <lb/>disease, which may ultimately prevent the derived disease, CRC [37]. <lb/>Since Metformin was able to revert the ACSL/SCD EMT phenotype, we tried to gain insight on <lb/>this process using organoid cultures resembling the different stages of a CRC progression. <lb/>Metformin treatment seems to be more efficient than 5-FU only during first tumor stages, making <lb/>organoids recovery harder compared to the ones treated with 5-FU. We propose that Metformin <lb/>therapies could be an appealing alternative in those cases when the tumor is detected in very early <lb/>stages rather than 5-FU treatments. However, some studies of Metformin treatment in CRC <lb/>patients points to stage III to be the most likeable to present an effect [38]. Since CRC is very <lb/>improbable to detect on its very early stages, known as one of the most silent and deadly cancer; <lb/>we wonder whether these studies with a low number of candidates in stage I are enough <lb/>representative. <lb/>As well, Metformin therapies has been proposed alone or in combination with other drugs, in <lb/>CRC. For example, Metformin has been recently combined with aspirin to treat middle stages in <lb/>non-diabetic CRC patients.( II and III stages) [39]. Furthermore, it exists a Phase 2 Trial for the <lb/>study of Metformin and 5-Fluorouracil combination in metastatic CRC [40] ,concluded with a <lb/>longstanding cancer control. An older report also claimed the benefits of this combination, but <lb/>they also reported that Metformin alone has antineoplastic activity per se in colon cancer cells, <lb/>and enhanced the activity of 5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in cells previously treated [41]. <lb/>Previous reports hypothesized that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I was the main <lb/>mechanism of action for Metformin. However, recent studies suggest that cancer progression is <lb/>compromised upon Metformin treatment, by decreasing the TCA cycle´s anaplerosis. Metformin <lb/>decreases the flow of glucose-and glutamine-derived metabolic intermediates into the TCA cycle, <lb/>decreasing the citrate output of the mitochondria and leading to a reduction of acetyl-CoA (Ac-<lb/>CoA) and oxaloacetate (OAA) in the cytoplasm and therefore a reduction in de novo FA synthesis <lb/>[42]. This way, Metformin could be targeting lipid metabolism through ACSL/SCD axis. ACSL4 <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>downregulation in the presence of Metformin is clearly evident and the results are larger <lb/>significant in first stages (I, II) (Fig 4A). Maybe, the reduced overexpression of ACSL4 in the <lb/>first stages (Fig 1A) increases the sensitivity to Metformin action (Fig 4A); while in more <lb/>advanced stages, the overexpression is so high that Metformin action could appear to be less <lb/>effective. This would not be the case for SCD, which showed no overexpression in the first stages <lb/>and enhanced overexpression in III and IV stages, though it is significantly reduced upon <lb/>Metformin exposure again in the first stages (Fig 4B). On the other hand, it has been reported that <lb/>variations in the types and amounts of fatty acids, are able to modify intracellular ACSLs <lb/>expression [43], thus, this conditions could be also affecting ACSL/SCD components expression <lb/>besides that the network connection between those enzymes could make them present coordinated <lb/>effects upon Metformin treatment, reducing its expression due to the lack of their substrate. <lb/>Metformin was also previously reported to downregulate ACSL expression, lowering fatty acid <lb/>synthesis and normalizing lipid profile in diabetic rats [44]; as well as limiting its products, 18-<lb/>carbon chain length fatty acids, in skeletal muscle insulin resistant rats [45], suggesting in this <lb/>case that metformin is increasing FAs mitochondrial channeling due to the reduction of CPT1 <lb/>inhibition by malonyl-CoA and therefore decreasing 18-carbon acyl-chain-derived bioactive <lb/>lipids in the cytoplasm [45], This action of Metformin could be additional to the aforementioned, <lb/>detoxifying ACSLs probable over activity. <lb/>Metformin seems also to target cancer stem cells of different cancer types [46]. However, we <lb/>have described for the first time the LGR5 downregulation in CRC-like organoids upon <lb/>Metformin treatment; consistent with previous reports using 2D CRC cultures [47]. LGR5 was <lb/>diminished in the whole CRC-like organoids series to minimum levels, an indicative that <lb/>Metformin action is affecting the stem cells of the crypt, responsible for the progression of the <lb/>organoids lineage. Curiously, Metformin treated organoids do not present apoptosis or even <lb/>necrosis, but they kept at a minimum size compared to other treatments, where the organoids layer <lb/>disappeared and the cells appeared apoptotic in the lumen (S6 Fig), showing that cell membrane <lb/>biogenesis is somehow blocked, mostly built by de novo lipogenesis routes. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>Finally, Metformin treated CRC organoids exhibit a greater compensatory increase in aerobic <lb/>glycolysis. Since ATP levels are diminished due to complex I inhibition, the metabolic sensor <lb/>AMPK is activated, inhibiting mTOR and proliferative events; and promoting glycolysis as an <lb/>alternative ATP source [48]. We found that even though the CRC-organoids serie presented an <lb/>increasing glycolysis with the stages, (Fig 5); Metformin was able to increase more this glycolytic <lb/>phenotype, especially in stage I organoids, coincident with the higher sensitivity to the drug in <lb/>this organoids. These results point towards Metformin targeting different metabolic routes other <lb/>that Warburg effect to perform its effect on CRC organoids viability. <lb/>Even though the Warburg effect is a priority for current drugs, each day the evidence grows that <lb/>other metabolic pathways should be targeted for cancer progression ablation. CRC is a leading <lb/>cause of death in the developed world, though yet simplistic preclinical models that mimic the <lb/>usual stages of CRC progression are lacking [13]. In this way, organoids further analysis need to <lb/>be included as the tool of choice for stage-dependent drugs screening. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>General conclusion <lb/>1. Organoids display a precise platform to assay tumor stage-dependent drugs being <lb/>suitable for personalized medicine, constituting an invaluable tool due to their relatively <lb/>low costs, animal saving suffering and their ease and legibility to genetically manipulate. <lb/>Metformin-related conclusions <lb/>2. Metformin treatment is further proved as an efficient drug in CRC: <lb/>-It is able to decrease CRC-like organoids viability at the same rate as current <lb/>chemotherapy (5-FU) but it does not affect to WT organoids. <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>-Metformin treatment recovery is significantly inferior compared to 5-FU in first stages <lb/>organoids, but with a greater recovery in WT organoids; becoming an appealing <lb/>chemotherapy drug in first tumor phases. <lb/>-Metformin downregulates the stem cell biomarker LGR5 and Wnt target genes <lb/>expression in all CRC-like organoid stages, reaffirming its potential use in intestinal <lb/>cancers. <lb/>-Metformin action in CRC organoids is not related to a Warburg-effect impairment, <lb/>presuming that other metabolisms rather than Warburg should be targeted to complete <lb/>the cancer progression obstruction <lb/>ACSL/SCD-related conclusions <lb/>3. ACSL4 is progressively overexpressed throughout CRC-like organoids stages; while <lb/>miR-19b-1-3p preserves its protective role, reflecting the role of ACSL/SCD axis action <lb/>on CRC progression. Besides, Metformin action is stronger on ACSL4 and SCD-<lb/>overexpressing first stages organoids, agreeing with Metformin greater action on this <lb/>stage. <lb/></body>
