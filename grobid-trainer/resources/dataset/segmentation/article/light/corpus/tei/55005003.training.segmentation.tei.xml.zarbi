Gene trap constructs contain a splice <lb/>acceptor and the GFP or Gal4FF (a modified version of the yeast Gal4 transcription activator) gene, and enhancer <lb/>trap constructs contain the zebrafish hsp70l promoter and the GFP or Gal4FF gene. By performing genetic screens <lb/>using these constructs, we have generated transgenic zebrafish that express GFP and Gal4FF in specific cells, <lb/>tissues and organs. Gal4FF expression is visualized by creating double transgenic fish carrying a Gal4FF transgene <lb/>and the GFP reporter gene placed downstream of the Gal4-recognition sequence (UAS). Further, the Gal4FF-<lb/>expressing cells can be manipulated by mating with UAS effector fish. For instance, when fish expressing Gal4FF in <lb/>specific neurons are crossed with the UAS:TeTxLC fish carrying the tetanus neurotoxin gene downstream of UAS, <lb/>the neuronal activities are inhibited in the double transgenic fish. Thus, these transgenic fish are useful to study <lb/>developmental biology and neurobiology. <lb/> Description: To increase the usefulness of the transgenic fish resource, we developed a web-based database <lb/>named zTrap http://kawakami.lab.nig.ac.jp/ztrap/. The zTrap database contains images of GFP and Gal4FF <lb/>expression patterns, and genomic DNA sequences surrounding the integration sites of the gene trap and enhancer <lb/>trap constructs. The integration sites are mapped onto the Ensembl zebrafish genome by in-house Blat analysis and <lb/>can be viewed on the zTrap and Ensembl genome browsers. Furthermore, zTrap is equipped with the functionality <lb/>to search these data for expression patterns and genomic loci of interest. zTrap contains the information about <lb/>transgenic fish including UAS reporter and effector fish. <lb/> Conclusion: zTrap is a useful resource to find gene trap and enhancer trap fish lines that express GFP and Gal4FF <lb/>in desired patterns, and to find insertions of the gene trap and enhancer trap constructs that are located within or <lb/>near genes of interest. These transgenic fish can be utilized to observe specific cell types during embryogenesis, to <lb/>manipulate their functions, and to discover novel genes and cis-regulatory elements. Therefore, zTrap should <lb/>facilitate studies on genomics, developmental biology and neurobiology utilizing the transgenic zebrafish resource. <lb/> </front> 
			
			<body>Background <lb/> Zebrafish has been used as a model vertebrate because <lb/>of high fecundity, rapid embryonic development, trans-<lb/>parency during embryonic stages and inexpensive and <lb/>easy breeding. We have developed a transposon technol-<lb/>ogy by using the medaka fish Tol2 transposable element <lb/>in this model vertebrate [1-5]. With the Tol2 transposon <lb/>technology, it is now possible for researchers to perform <lb/>highly efficient transgenesis in zebrafish and powerful <lb/>genetic approaches such as gene trapping, enhancer <lb/>trapping and targeted gene expression by the Gal4-UAS <lb/>system [4,6-10]. These have greatly advanced genetic <lb/>studies in zebrafish and increased the usefulness of zeb-<lb/>rafish as a vertebrate model. <lb/>We have constructed different types of Tol2-based <lb/> gene trap and enhancer trap constructs. T2KSAG and <lb/>T2KSAGFF (referred to as T2KSAGFF(LF) hereafter) are <lb/>gene trap constructs that contain the GFP and Gal4FF <lb/>

			gene, a modified version of the yeast Gal4 transcrip-<lb/>tion activator, downstream of the rabbit b-globin splice <lb/>acceptor (SA), respectively. T2KHG, T2KhspGGFF and <lb/>T2KhspGFF are enhancer trap constructs that contain the <lb/>GFP, Gal4FF-GFP fusion, and Gal4FF gene downstream <lb/>of the zebrafish hsp70l promoter, respectively [4,9,10] <lb/>(Figure 1). To visualize Gal4FF expression, we constructed <lb/>transgenic fish carrying the GFP or RFP reporter gene <lb/>downstream of the Gal4 recognition sequence (UAS:GFP <lb/>and UAS:RFP). By using these constructs and transgenic <lb/>fish, we have performed genetic screens, and generated a <lb/>large number of transgenic fish that express GFP and <lb/>Gal4FF in specific tissues, cells and organs. <lb/>These transgenic fish have been useful for various stu-<lb/>dies in developmental biology, genomics and neurobiol-<lb/>ogy. For example, a novel hoxC transcript was revealed <lb/>by the SAGp22A line [4], new functions for the tcf7 <lb/> gene and the synembryn-like gene were uncovered using <lb/>HG21C and HGn8H [9], mitochondrion-rich cells on <lb/>the skin were visualized using HG9B [11], dilatation of <lb/>the cardiac ventricle was analyzed using SAG4A [12], <lb/>the misty somites gene encoding a maternal factor <lb/>involved in somitogenesis was discovered in SAG20A <lb/>[13,14], innervation of hair cells by afferent neurons was <lb/>visualized in HGn39D [15], and nasal-temporal pattern-<lb/>ing of the retina by Fgf signaling was demonstrated <lb/>using HGn42A [16]. More recent examples include <lb/>studies of cell-fate determination in the notochord <lb/>using SAGFF214A [17], characterization of the somato-<lb/>topic projections of the lateral line afferent neurons in <lb/>the CNS using hspGFF53A [18], sex-reversal in the <lb/> fancl mutant HG10A [19], patterning of the lymphatic <lb/>system (SAGFF27C;[20]), and lens fiber differentiation <lb/>(SAGFF168A;[21]). Furthermore, the Gal4FF-expressing <lb/>transgenic fish can be used for targeted expression of a <lb/>desired gene in a desired place. For instance, we created <lb/>transgenic fish carrying the tetanus neurotoxin gene <lb/>downstream of the Gal4 recognition sequence (UAS: <lb/>TeTxLC and UAS:TeTxLC:CFP). When these UAS <lb/>effector fish were crossed with transgenic fish that <lb/>expressed Gal4FF in subsets of the spinal neurons <lb/>or olfactory neurons (SAGFF31B, SAGFF36B, and <lb/>SAGFF27A), double transgenic fish exhibited specific <lb/>behavioral abnormalities, demonstrating successful <lb/> Figure 1 Tol2 transposon constructs used to create transgenic zebrafish.

			inhibition of the specific neural circuits by targeted <lb/>expression of the tetanus toxin [10,22]. <lb/>Previously, GFP enhancer trap screens using Tol2 [6] <lb/>or Sleeping Beauty [23], an enhancer trap screen by <lb/>using a retroviral vector [24,25], gene trap and enhancer <lb/>trap screens to generate transgenic fish that express <lb/>Gal4 in specific patterns [7,8] were carried out also in <lb/>other laboratories. Although a database containing the <lb/>data from 27 GFP-expressing fish was created previously <lb/>[26]http://plover.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/~zetrap/ZETRAP. <lb/>htm, it is at present difficult to search most of these <lb/>transgenic fish because of the absence of searchable <lb/>databases. To make the transgenic fish generated in our <lb/>laboratory more useful, we aimed to develop a database <lb/>equipped with search functions that contains the expres-<lb/>sion pattern data and the integration site data from our <lb/>transgenic fish. Here we report a web-based database <lb/>named zTrap (zebrafish gene trap and enhancer trap <lb/>database). <lb/> Construction and content <lb/> The zTrap database was constructed by using the fol-<lb/>lowing applications: OS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux; the <lb/>database management system, MySQL 5.0; the applica-<lb/>tion server, Tomcat 5.5; the user interface, Java Server <lb/>Face 1. 1; the web server, Apache 2. The zTrap database <lb/>scheme is depicted in Figure 2. The database contains <lb/>image, insertion, cDNA, transposon construct, and fish <lb/>status data. The image data have a line name, which <lb/>corresponds to the name of the insertion carried by the <lb/>transgenic line, and thus the image and insertion data <lb/>are connected. Also, the line name is used to connect <lb/>these data to the fish status and cDNA data. A line <lb/>name consists of transposon construct name, number <lb/>and letter, and thereby the image and insertion data are <lb/>connected to the transposon construct data. <lb/>(1) Image data: we have performed gene trap and <lb/>enhancer trap screens and created transgenic fish that <lb/>expressed GFP and Gal4FF in spatially and temporally <lb/>restricted patterns. Image data were generated from <lb/>these transgenic fish lines. The image data consist of <lb/>image; line name (construct plus number); image type <lb/>(selected from expression pattern, in situ or movie); <lb/>effector (UAS lines used to visualize Gal4FF expression); <lb/>line type (for now, transgenic only); stage (when the <lb/>image was taken); region (where the expression was <lb/>observed); and information (links to insertion and trans-<lb/>poson construct data) (Figure 3A). <lb/>Images are acquired by photographing transgenic <lb/>embryos with a CCD camera under a fluorescent stereo <lb/>microscope. When we obtain an image of the offspring <lb/>from fish injected with a Tol2 construct, we first assign <lb/>a line name to the image data. The line name is com-<lb/>posed of an abbreviation of the Tol2 construct used <lb/>(namely, SAG for T2KSAG, HG for T2KHG, hspGGFF <lb/>for T2KhspGGFF, hspGFF for T2KhspGFF, and SAGFF <lb/>(LF) for T2KSAGFF(LF)), a number given to individual <lb/>founder fish in the order of successful mating, and a <lb/> Figure 2 The zTrap database scheme. The image, insertion, cDNA and fish status data are connected via line names, which are the same as <lb/>insertion names. A line name (insertion name) is composed of a construct name, number and a letter. The transposon construct data are <lb/>connected via the construct name.  &quot; N-1 &quot;  and  &quot; 1-1 &quot;  denote many-to-one and one-to-one relationships, respectively. An instance of the N-1 <lb/>relationship is that two images are linked with the SAG2A fish line (insertion) in Figure 4A. <lb/>

			letter that discriminates different expression patterns <lb/>observed in offspring from the same founder. To <lb/>describe the GFP expression patterns, we selected 32 <lb/>terms from anatomical ontology in ZFIN http://zfin.org/ <lb/>action/anatomy/search. By using these terms, expression <lb/>annotation is carried out in our weekly screen meetings. <lb/>New anatomical terms may be added to the data sheet <lb/>when new expression patterns are observed. Currently, <lb/>the image data were created for previously published <lb/>transgenic lines; namely, 37 SAG lines [4], 72 HG lines <lb/>[9], 28 hspGGFF lines [10], 1 hspGFF line [18], and 9 <lb/>SAGFF(LF) lines [10,17,20-22], and more data for new <lb/>transgenic fish are being added daily. <lb/> zTrap contains image data for UAS reporter and effec-<lb/>tor lines and other transgenic lines as well; i.e., the <lb/>UASGFP, UASRFP, UASTeTxLC, UASTeTxLCCFP, and <lb/>XIG lines. These transgenic fish were created in our <lb/>laboratory also by Tol2-mediated transgensis. Image <lb/>data of UAS lines are acquired by crossing these lines <lb/>with appropriate Gal4 drivers. The information of the <lb/>Gal4 driver is also attached to the image data of the <lb/>UAS lines (Figure 4B). The XIG fish carries the GFP <lb/>gene under the control of the EF1a promoter [4]. For <lb/>UASTeTxLCCFP, movie files were uploaded to show <lb/>behavioral defects in double transgenic fish more clearly. <lb/>(2) Insertion data: all of transgenic fish created in our <lb/>laboratory have been analyzed by Southern blot hybridi-<lb/>zation to identify fish with single Tol2 insertions. When <lb/>fish turn out to carry multiple insertions, they are mated <lb/>with non-transgenic fish to generate fish with single <lb/>insertions in the next generation [27]. This process is <lb/>important to exclude ambiguity concerning the relation-<lb/>ship between an expression pattern and a causative <lb/>insertion, and also makes it easy to amplify genomic <lb/>DNA surrounding the Tol2 insertions by inverse PCR <lb/>and adaptor-ligation PCR. Insertion data are created <lb/>based on these analyses. <lb/>The insertion data consist of the insertion name <lb/>(which corresponds to a line name); a transposon con-<lb/>struct used to create the insertion; gene (when Tol2 is <lb/>integrated within a gene); keywords (given manually); <lb/>checkboxes to show whether it is located within exon or <lb/>intron; its chromosomal position; genomic DNA <lb/>sequence at the integration site retrieved from inverse <lb/>PCR or adaptor-ligation PCR; and the result of in-house <lb/>Blat analysis using the DNA sequence. The position of <lb/>the 8-bp target site duplication created upon integration <lb/>is highlighted in blue in the DNA sequence (Figure 3B). <lb/>The genomic DNA sequence surrounding the integra-<lb/>tion site is analyzed by in-house Blat search against the <lb/> Danio rerio genomic data that is downloaded from the <lb/> Ensembl FTP server ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/curren-<lb/>t_fasta/danio_rerio/dna/. Currently Zv8 is used, and a <lb/>newer version of the genome data will be downloaded <lb/>when it becomes available. When the integration site is <lb/>successfully mapped on the Ensembl genome, the chro-<lb/>mosome number and the start and end positions are <lb/>incorporated into the insertion data. The mapping pro-<lb/>cess is in part carried out manually when the in-house <lb/>Blat analysis showed no hit or multiple hits. If the inte-<lb/>gration site is mapped within an annotated transcript, <lb/>the gene name and specific location within an exon or <lb/>intron are added manually later. Keywords are added <lb/>also manually. If transcripts surrounding the insertion <lb/>are analyzed by cDNA cloning, the cDNA data are <lb/>linked to the corresponding insertion data. The insertion <lb/>data have been created for all of 152 transgenic lines <lb/>described above, and more data are being added daily. <lb/>(3) cDNA data: when we analyzed transcripts trapped <lb/>by gene trap insertions or located near integration loci <lb/>by RT-PCR, 5&apos;RACE, 3&apos;RACE or other methods, cDNA <lb/>data are created. The cDNA data contain the cDNA <lb/>name, the corresponding insertion name, a gene type <lb/>(known, unknown or predicted), a type of experiment <lb/>(RT-PCR, 5&apos;RACE or 3&apos;RACE), sequence itself and the <lb/>result of in-house Blat analysis using the sequence <lb/>(Figure 3C). This analysis is optional and is not carried <lb/>out for all transgenic lines. Of the 147 insertions of the <lb/>gene trap and enhancer trap constructs described above, <lb/>20 were analyzed for cDNA data. <lb/>(4) Transposon construct data: these data contain the <lb/>restriction map and sequence information of the trans-<lb/>poson constructs used to create the transgenic fish (Fig-<lb/>ure 3D). Currently, these include the gene trap and <lb/>enhancer trap constructs (T2KSAG, T2KSAGFF(LF), <lb/>T2KHG, T2KhspGGFF, and T2KhspGFF), the T2KXIG <lb/>construct (Figure 1), and the UAS reporter and effector <lb/>constructs (UAS:GFP, UAS:RFP, and UAS:TeTxLC:CFP). <lb/>(5) Fish status data: these data indicate the status of <lb/>transgenic fish in our laboratory; i.e., whether they are <lb/>kept alive in the fish room (a  &quot; fish tank &quot; icon) stored as <lb/>frozen sperms (a  &quot; tube &quot;  icon), or whether they have been <lb/>terminated or lost (a  &quot; fish skeleton &quot; icon)(Figure 3E). <lb/> Utility and Discussion <lb/> Find image <lb/> The  &quot; Find Image &quot; page is the main page of the zTrap <lb/> database (Figure 4A and additional file 1).

Thus, users <lb/>can find transgenic fish lines that show expression pat-<lb/>terns of interest or that are created by using a construct <lb/>of interest. In these columns,  &quot; ALL &quot;  can also be selected. <lb/>The  &quot; advanced search &quot; allows users to select regions and <lb/>stages with more flexibility.

To view many <lb/>images at the same time, the image data can be shown <lb/>as a list by clicking  &quot; Show Image List &quot; or  &quot; Show Line <lb/>List &quot; (Figure 4A). <lb/>There are four types of icons next to the line name. <lb/>A  &quot; fish tank &quot; icon opens the fish status data. These data <lb/>are useful when users request transgenic fish from us. <lb/>A  &quot; transposon icon &quot; (depicted in a shape of a inverted tri-<lb/>angle) opens the corresponding insertion data (Figure 4A). <lb/> &quot; z! &quot;  and  &quot; e! &quot;  icons link with the zTrap and Ensembl gen-<lb/>ome browsers, respectively, and appear next to the line <lb/>name when the genomic DNA sequence at the integration <lb/>site was successfully mapped onto the Ensembl genome by <lb/>in-house Blat analysis. <lb/> Find UAS <lb/> The UAS-reporter and UAS-effector fish that carry a <lb/>reporter or effector gene downstream of the Gal4 <lb/>recognition sequence are useful to visualize and <lb/>manipulate Gal4FF-expressing cells. Such UAS trans-<lb/>genic fish can be explored by clicking  &quot; Find UAS &quot; on <lb/>the menu bar (Figure 4B). The  &quot; Find UAS &quot; page has a <lb/>similar function to that of the  &quot; Find Image &quot; page but <lb/>lacks the  &quot; by region &quot; column since it is not applicable <lb/>to the UAS fish. UAS reporter or effector fish of inter-<lb/>est are easily found by clicking a construct in the  &quot; by <lb/> construct &quot; column. Thumbnail images (in some cases, <lb/>movies) of the UAS fish, the line names, icons, and the <lb/>information on Gal4FF drivers will appear on the right. <lb/>We also analyzed the integration sites of the UAS con-<lb/>structs by inverse PCR and adaptor-ligation PCR. <lb/>Thus, insertion data are created for all of the UAS fish <lb/>lines and linked to the UAS image data. <lb/> Find Insertion <lb/>  &quot; Find Insertion &quot; on the menu bar opens dialog boxes to <lb/>search insertion data by an insertion name, a transposon <lb/>construct name, checkboxes (&quot;Exon &quot; and  &quot; Intron &quot; ), key-<lb/>words, and a chromosome number (Figure 4C). The cor-<lb/>responding insertion data will be shown as a list. From the <lb/>list, it is possible to view the insertion site and jump to the <lb/>insertion data and the genome browsers. The  &quot; Exon &quot;  and <lb/> &quot; Intron &quot;  checkboxes are useful to find possible insertional <lb/>mutations caused by integration of a Tol2 construct. <lb/>These two checkboxes can be checked simultaneously. <lb/>Search by the chromosome number is useful to identify <lb/>insertions located near a locus of interest. Such insertions <lb/>may be used for genetic mapping or as dominant markers <lb/>on a balancer chromosome to maintain a lethal mutation. <lb/> Gene-to-Insertion Search <lb/> We developed the  &quot; Gene-to-Insertion &quot;  program to further <lb/>facilitate searching the insertion data.  &quot; Gene-to-Insertion &quot; <lb/> on the menu bar opens a dialog box (Figure 4D). Users <lb/>can type a gene name (hox, sox, etc.), gene ID starting <lb/>from zgc (ZFIN gene name) or ENSDARG (Ensembl <lb/>genes), or any words linked to the Ensembl transcript <lb/>database. The Gene-to-Insertion program first identifies <lb/>genes that have the typed word in their descriptions, and <lb/>then finds insertions that are located within a distance of <lb/>100-kb from the identified genes. Thus, users may find <lb/>transgenic fish lines that express GFP or Gal4FF in a pat-<lb/>tern that corresponds to that of a gene of interest or may <lb/>find an insertional mutation of a gene of interest. <lb/> The zTrap genome browser <lb/> In order to see the genomic landscape surrounding the <lb/>integration site quickly, we developed the zTrap genome <lb/>browser. The  &quot; z! &quot;  icon found in many places is used to <lb/>open the browser (Figure 5A). On the zTrap genome <lb/>browser, 100-kb of the genomic sequence surrounding a <lb/> Tol2 insertion (indicated by a pink bar with an inverted <lb/>triangle) can be viewed with zoom-in and zoom-out <lb/>functions. The Tol2 construct can be inserted in two dif-<lb/>ferent orientations. We previously defined the left (L) <lb/>and right (R) ends of Tol2 with respect to the direction of <lb/>the transposase gene [28]. When the insertion is placed <lb/>above the genomic sequence (two blue lines in the cen-<lb/>ter), the L end of Tol2 is located on the left, and when <lb/>the insertion is placed below the genomic sequence, the <lb/>L end is located on the right. The z! browser essentially <lb/>contains the same data as the Ensembl browser. The D. <lb/>rerio cDNA, Ensembl transcript and EST transcript data <lb/>are downloaded from Ensembl and can be seen on multi-<lb/>ple tracks of the z! browser. Descriptions about the inser-<lb/>tion, D. rerio cDNA, Ensembl transcript and EST <lb/>transcript appear as pop-ups when they are clicked. In <lb/>addition, other insertions and original cDNA located <lb/>within a distance of 100-kb can be seen simultaneously. <lb/> Link to Ensembl <lb/> When the  &quot; e! &quot;  icon found in many places is clicked, the <lb/>positional information of the integration site is trans-<lb/>ferred to the Ensembl genome browser, and the  &quot; region <lb/> in detail &quot; display of the corresponding genomic locus <lb/>will open. Furthermore, we developed a DAS (Distribu-<lb/>ted Annotation System) server. The zTrap track appears <lb/>on the Ensembl genome browser by executing the fol-<lb/>lowing procedure (Figure 5B); (1) from the  &quot; region in <lb/>detail &quot; display page, select  &quot; configure this page &quot; , (2) <lb/>select  &quot; custom data &quot; on the top bar, (3) select  &quot; Attach <lb/> DAS &quot; , (4) type  &quot; ztrap &quot;  in the  &quot; Filter sources &quot; box and <lb/>click  &quot; Next &quot; , (5) check the  &quot; zTrap &quot;  check box and click <lb/> &quot; Next &quot; , and close the pop-up window. <lb/> Conclusions <lb/> The zTrap database developed in this study allows users <lb/>to rapidly search a large number of transgenic fish lines <lb/>
