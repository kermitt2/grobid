			<body>Introduction <lb/>Insect eye-colour mutants are important research models in biological sciences [1-5]. The <lb/>analysis of eye colour-linked mutations in D. melanogaster confirmed the chromosomal theory <lb/>of heredity and for the first time allowed linking a single gene with its locus on the chromo-<lb/>some (the sex chromosome) [6,7]. The majority of studies in this field use holometabolous <lb/>insect models such as Diptera [8,9], Coleoptera [10], Hymenoptera [11] and Lepidoptera <lb/>[12,13] while Hemimetabola are often neglected. Within Hemimetabola the Hemiptera order <lb/></body>

			<body>contains the most common hemimetabolous colour mutant groups [14-17]. The genes deter-<lb/>mine the eye colour traits code for proteins associated with the eye pigmentation and other <lb/>eye-independent functions. The eye colour mutants are commonly used as the experimental <lb/>models to study insect genetics [1,16,18,19], body pigmentation [5,20], general physiological <lb/>processes [2,21-23], behaviour [24,25] and aging [26]. In addition, the eye colour mutants and <lb/>genes related to this mutation have recently been studied as potential markers for genetic <lb/>transformation in various insects [10,27]. <lb/>The colour of insect compound eye is broadly determined by the nature of different pig-<lb/>ments [5]. Ommochromes and pteridines are essential pigments that contribute to eye pig-<lb/>mentation [4,5,28-30]. Ommochromes are products of tryptophan metabolism while <lb/>pteridines are synthesised from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) [5]. A dysfunction of the trans-<lb/>porter or the enzymes involved in the synthesis pathway of these pigments leads to aberrant <lb/>pigment content and results in the modification of the wild type eye colour [10,11,24]. The <lb/>ommochromes and pteridines are important for eye functionality, reception of visual stimuli <lb/>[22,31], free radicals scavenging [5,32,33] and functionality of the immune system [34]. More-<lb/>over, the synthesis pathways of these pigments are tightly coupled with the metabolism of bio-<lb/>active compounds or key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin [5,35]. The <lb/>guanine derived from GTP and a cofactor of the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylase <lb/>enzymes, the tetrahydropterin (BH4) are required for the synthesis of dopamine [36], while <lb/>tryptophan is a precursor of serotonin [37]. Studies showed that Drosophila melanogaster eye <lb/>colour mutants have altered levels and distributions of dopamine and serotonin neurotrans-<lb/>mitters [24,37]. <lb/>The mutations that affect insect eye pigmentation can be divided, depending on the cate-<lb/>gory of pathway they target, into four groups affecting: (1) xanthommatin biosynthesis, (2) <lb/>pteridine biosynthesis, (3) transmembrane transport of eye pigments and/or pigment precur-<lb/>sors, and (4) pigment granule formation [30,38-40]. Several genes regulating the processes <lb/>listed above had been identified in D. melanogaster [1]. The transmembrane transport of eye <lb/>pigments and/or pigment precursors depends on three transporter genes: white, scarlet and <lb/>brown [40,41]. The formation of the pigment granules, which are the pigment-containing <lb/>organelles located within the pigment cells, depends on several genes such as garnet and light, <lb/>which are involved in the delivery of proteins necessary for granule biogenesis and mainte-<lb/>nance [41]. <lb/>The cricket (Orthoptera, Gryllidae) is the fundamental hemimetabolous insect model for <lb/>the fields of behavioural research [42] and leg regeneration [43]. A comparison between this <lb/>hemimetabolous evolutionary older insect species and holometabolous D. melanogaster can <lb/>provide valuable comparative information about the metabolism and functions of insects&apos; eye <lb/>pigments. It is known that in hemimetabolous insects, such as the Hemiptera, the eye colour <lb/>mutations are derived from the changes in a single gene [15-17]. So far, only one eye colour <lb/>mutant has been reported in Orthoptera, in the yellow-eyed Gryllus bimaculatus strain from <lb/>Japan [44]. However there is no information about the gene(s) affected by this mutation [45]. <lb/>Yellow (Y) and White (W) eye colour strains of the house cricket Acheta domesticus derived <lb/>from the spontaneous mutations were established in our laboratory in Katowice, Poland in <lb/>2015. The mutated-eye phenotype is observable in all developmental stages from the nymph to <lb/>imago. In order to characterise these two mutated strains and make them available for further <lb/>research, we first determined if these were sex-independent and single gene mutations, and <lb/>then we investigated in detail the eye pigment granules and pigment content in the mutants. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and methods <lb/>Establishment of yellow and white eye colour cricket strains <lb/>A single yellow-eye (Y) imago male was found by chance in a laboratory culture of wild-type, <lb/>black-eyed (B) crickets devoted mostly to a behavioural and toxicological genetic research in <lb/>2015 at the University of Silesia in Katowice, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, <lb/>Poland. In order to establish a yellow-eye color colony, the yellow-eye male was paired with <lb/>the black-eye females. The obtained offspring were all black-eyed. These black-eye progenies <lb/>(F1) were subsequently interbred and produced both black-and yellow-eye offspring (F2). The <lb/>yellow-eye females and males were isolated to establish a pure yellow-eyed strain. In the third <lb/>generation, four white-eye females and three males were found. The yellow (Y, genotype WW/ <lb/>yy) and white (W, genotype ww/yy) eye phenotypes had persisted in the colony for over one <lb/>year, since 2015. The black-eyed (B, genotype WW/YY) strain used in this study is the original <lb/>laboratory strain in which no further yellow or white-eye mutants were observed. All strains <lb/>were reared at 30 0 ± 2˚C and 40% ± 10% relative humidity with a 12:12 light:dark cycle (light <lb/>source: incandescent lamp Spectrum W0J21508, T8 G13 18W 6500K). During their whole life, <lb/>the insects had access to shelter, water and food ad libitum. <lb/>Genetic crosses <lb/>To determine the relationship between genes and heredity, crosses between all strains were <lb/>conducted. Males and females, 5 days after imaginal molt, were used for the experiment. In <lb/>each testcross 24 pairs were tested: 12 pairs for males and females (from all strains) in different <lb/>configurations (yellow male x black female, black male x yellow female etc.). Eye colour was <lb/>assessed at the 3rd-instar nymph stage in the filial generation. Although the sequencing of the <lb/>wild type and mutated genes is still in progress and the exact source of phenotype changes <lb/>remains unknown, for the purpose of this study the observed traits were assigned to the theo-<lb/>retical genes: y-yellow eye gene, and w-white eye gene. For the clarity of the crosses descrip-<lb/>tion, the Wild strain (B) was described as WW/YY, the Yellow strain as-WW/yy, and the <lb/>White strain as-ww/yy. <lb/>For backcross procedure, heterozygous individuals (F1) from crosses of BxW (Ww/Yy), <lb/>BxY (WW/Yy), WxY (Ww/yy) were crossed with recessive homozygote: White (ww/yy) or <lb/>Yellow (WW/yy) respectively, in both sex configurations. All configurations were made in six <lb/>replicates. Phenotypes from obtained progeny were counted, and an analysis of the frequency <lb/>distribution was conducted utilizing a Chi-square test or binominal test. <lb/>Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) <lb/>Adult specimens (males) of the wild-type and eye colour mutants (20 specimens from each <lb/>strain) were decapitated. Their head capsules were opened, and the eyes were isolated. The <lb/>morphology of the eyes was analysed using an Olympus SZX16 stereoscope. A series of images <lb/>were acquired using an Olympus DP72 digital camera mounted on the stereoscope. For light <lb/>and TEM microscopy, the eyes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 M sodium phos-<lb/>phate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4˚C for 24h. After washing in phosphate buffer (5 times, 30 min each), <lb/>the material was post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (4˚C, 2h), <lb/>rinsed with the same buffer and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, <lb/>96% and 100%, each for 15 min), acetone (2 times, 15 min each) and then infiltrated succes-<lb/>sively through mixtures of acetone and Epon 812 resin (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3). Thereafter, the mate-<lb/>rial was embedded in Epon 812 resin (Fullam Inc., Latham, NY, USA) and polymerised into <lb/>the resin blocks at 60˚C for 48 h. The semi-and ultra-thin sections were cut with a diamond <lb/></body>

			<body>knife using a Leica Ultracut UCT25 ultramicrotome. Semi-thin sections (600 nm thick) were <lb/>stained with 1% methylene blue in 0.5% borax and analysed using an Olympus BX60 light <lb/>microscope. Ultra-thin sections (70 nm thick) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate <lb/>and examined with a Hitachi H500 transmission electron microscope. A quantitative analysis <lb/>of light vacuoles was made on horizontal eye sections (light microscopy) from wild and mutant <lb/>cricket strains. The comparison of the area was made on sections cut below crystal cone (visi-<lb/>ble rhabdomeres). The analysis of digital photos was performed with the use of ImageJ soft-<lb/>ware on randomly selected areas (500x500 pix) [46]. Light vacuole areas were quantified as the <lb/>percentage of selected squares. <lb/>Pigments extraction <lb/>To determine the biochemical basis of the yellow and white-eye phenotype, ommochromes <lb/>and pteridines were extracted using two different methods described by Nijhout (1997) and <lb/>Tomic-Carruthers et al.(1996) [47]. The 10-day-old imagoes (males) were used to extract the <lb/>pigments (females were tested in a preliminary study, and there was no difference in pigment <lb/>content between females and males). For ommochromes and pteridines extraction, 6 pairs of <lb/>eyes were isolated from insects of each phenotype. For ommochromes extraction, the eyes <lb/>were homogenised individually in 1% HCl in methanol (150 μL/50mg of tissue) and extracted <lb/>in the dark for 1 hour. Each homogenate was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. For pteri-<lb/>dines extraction, the eyes were homogenised individually in a mixture of 3.5% aqueous ammo-<lb/>nia and n-propanol 1:2 (150 μL/50mg of tissue) and extracted in the dark for 1hour. The <lb/>homogenates were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. <lb/>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) <lb/>TLC is one of the most fundamental compound separation methods, often used in insect eye <lb/>pigment analysis. 5 μL of pigments extract was applied to HPTLC plate (Pre-coated HPTLC <lb/>plates Nano-Adamant layer 0.2 mm, silica gel 60) under dim light. Extracts from six insects <lb/>per strain were used in this method. After drying for 10 minutes, the plate was placed in the <lb/>chromatographic horizontal chamber. Two different mixtures were used as a developing sol-<lb/>vent: phenol: water (3:1) for ommochromes, and 1% aqueous ammonia and n-propanol (1:2) <lb/>for pteridines. The plate was developed for 90 min and dried in the dark for 12 hours. Dry <lb/>plates were visualised using a UV transiluminator (365 nm) and archived digitally for further <lb/>analysis. For spots detection, Rf values and areas determination, the digital images were ana-<lb/>lysed with CpAtlas v. 2.0 [48] software. To determine spots colour, ImageJ software was used <lb/>for RGB values measurement [49]. <lb/>Spectrophotometry <lb/>The overall concentration of compounds in the extraction mixture was evaluated by spectro-<lb/>photometry. Concentration of both ommochromes and pteridines was measured on micro-<lb/>plates (UV Cornstar GE half-area 96 wells) using an Infinite M200 TECAN reader. For <lb/>pteridines, the supernatant was diluted at 1:3 ratio with the extraction solution. Thereafter, the <lb/>mixture was applied into the wells, and the clear extraction solvent was used as a baseline. The <lb/>absorbance value was measured at the 230-350 nm (2 nm step) wavelength range. Ommo-<lb/>chromes extraction solvents were used undiluted, and the clear extraction solvent was used as <lb/>a baseline. The absorbance value was measured at the 230-650 nm (2 nm step) wavelength <lb/>range. For each group of pigments, six replicates per phenotype were used. <lb/></body>

			<body>Spectrofluorometry <lb/>The fluorescence value of compounds in the extraction mixture was evaluated by spectrofluo-<lb/>rometry. The fluorescence of ommochromes and pteridines was measured with a microplate <lb/>reader (Spark 10M TECAN) on Thermo Fisher Scientific-Nunclon 96 Flat Black microplates. <lb/>Due to a too high emission, the extraction solution was diluted 40x for pteridines, and 200 μL <lb/>of mixture was applied into the wells. Ommochromes extraction solution remained undiluted. <lb/>Clear extraction solvent was used as the baseline. The excitation wavelength was set on 365 <lb/>nm, and the emission value was quantified at the spectrum window 400-600 nm (excitation/ <lb/>emission bandwidth 20 nm, integration time 250 s, 1 nm step). For each pigment group, six <lb/>replicates per phenotype were used. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>The statistical analysis was performed using Prism 6.0 GraphPad software. The dependence <lb/>tests were used to compare expected frequencies and the frequencies of traits obtained in <lb/>genetic crosses. Depending on the number of groups, either a binominal or Chi^2 test was <lb/>used. A parametric ANOVA test (Tukey test, p&lt;0.05) was used for quantitative analysis of the <lb/>absorbancy maxima, TLC spots and white vacuoles area. <lb/>Results <lb/>Genetic crosses <lb/>The series of crossbreeds between individuals from studied lines provided a complete set of <lb/>information about the inheritance of the studied traits (Table 1). In heterozygous generation <lb/>(F1), all individuals exhibited a dominant phenotype, black or yellow; black eyes for B x Y and <lb/>B x W crosses, and yellow eyes for Y x W. The next generation (F2), derived from crossing het-<lb/>erozygous BY and WY individuals consisted of typical unigenous distribution (3:1) of pheno-<lb/>types, with the black and yellow dominant phenotype, respectively. A similar distribution was <lb/>observed independently of sex sets. The more complex picture appeared in the F2 generation <lb/>after B x W cross. Observed distribution fitted the model 12:3:1 (black: yellow: white). In this <lb/>model, the offspring containing the recessive homozygotic white gene and heterozygotic yel-<lb/>low gene or dominant homozygotic yellow gene (ww/Yy, ww/YY) expresses black eye pheno-<lb/>type. The results of the B x Y and Y x W crosses indicate that the two observed phenotype <lb/>traits are determined by two independent genes. There is no evidence that these traits are asso-<lb/>ciated with the sex. This interpretation is supported by the result of the series of backcrosses <lb/>(Table 2). The results of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes crosses (Y and W) are simi-<lb/>lar to the expected distributions (1:1). <lb/>Structure of the A. domesticus eyes <lb/>Each examined strain (wild type and mutants) had a characteristic, distinctive eye colour. The <lb/>wild-type had black coloured eyes (Fig 1A), while the mutants had yellow (Fig 1B) or white <lb/>eyes (Fig 1C). The single eye is hemispherical and consists of hundreds of hexagonal omma-<lb/>tidia (Fig 1A-1C), which rest on a basement membrane (Fig 2A-2C). In both the wild-type <lb/>and the mutants, the spatial organization of the ommatidia was regular, and they were <lb/>arranged parallel to each other (Fig 2A-2I). A single ommatidium is composed of a smooth <lb/>cornea, a crystalline cone surrounded by primary pigment cells, a cluster of the retinula, and <lb/>the secondary pigment cells (Fig 2A-2I). Lateral membranes of retinula cells form finger-like <lb/>microvilli, which are arranged in rhabdom in the central part of the ommatidium (Figs 2A-2I, <lb/>3A, 3D and 3E). In the basal part of the eye, the axons of retinula cells of each ommatidium <lb/></body>

			<body>exit the eye through the holes in the basement membrane (Fig 2B and 2C). The cytoplasm of <lb/>retinula cells is rich in mitochondria, swollen cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum [50], <lb/>free ribosomes, multivesicular bodies, lamellar bodies, vesicles with an electron-lucent content <lb/>(Fig 3A-3E) and light vacuoles (Fig 2D-2F). Clusters of mitochondria accumulate in the vicin-<lb/>ity of rhabdom membranes (Fig 3A, 3D and 3E). In the wild type eye, the cytoplasm of retinula <lb/>cells contained multiple granules with homogeneous or heterogeneous electron-dense content <lb/>(Fig 3A and 3C). On the semi-and ultrathin sections of the yellow eye mutant, the cytoplasm <lb/>of retinula cells contained a small number of fine, electron-dense granules (Fig 3D), while in <lb/>the white-eyed mutants, such granules were never observed (Fig 3E). Furthermore, in the wild <lb/>type eye, many electron-dense granules were found in the cytoplasm of pigment cells lining <lb/>the outside of each ommatidium. These granules were not noticed in both yellow and white <lb/>mutant pigment cells (Figs 2A-2I, 3D and 3E). Many light (low electron density) areas, inside <lb/>and outside of cells, are visible in horizontal and longitudinal sections of ommatidia of the <lb/>white strain crickets. The analysis of the region occupied by light vacuoles in horizontal eye <lb/>sections from all the strains was conducted. Obtained results confirmed significantly higher <lb/>occurrence and a greater surface occupied by light areas on the eye sections from the white <lb/>strain in comparison to the yellow and black strains (Fig 4). <lb/>Composition of eye pigments in wild type and mutant eyes <lb/>The TLC analysis of pigment composition was based on the colour and retardation factor (R f ) <lb/>of the obtained spots. The results of isolation and separation of pigments from each strain <lb/>were digitally captured (Fig 5). Although it was not possible to accurately identify most of the <lb/>isolated compounds (Table 3), the TLC analysis showed that the major changes in the mutant <lb/>strains involved the ommochromes pigments. In the chromatogram of the black strain, three <lb/>brown spots were observed with a dominant, dark 5th spot (xanthomatine) which is the main, <lb/>dark color visual pigment in insects. The major phenotypic difference between wild type and <lb/>mutant cricket strains was the absence of this brown pigment. The yellow-eyed strain lac the <lb/>brown pigment (which in the wild type obscures light-coloured pigments), while the white-<lb/>eyed crickets lacks all eye pigments. In the case of the yellow-eyed crickets, it is hard to tell if <lb/>the yellow colour is caused by the ommochrome or pteridine pigments because both these pig-<lb/>ments cause yellow colouration of the tissue. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>In summary, the yellow eye strain lacks 6 out of 11 spots present in the black eye strain. <lb/>Moreover, in the samples from the yellow eye insects, there is one additional pigment spot <lb/>(designated as # 10) not observed in the other strains. In the white strain insects, only 2 spots <lb/>out of 11 spots present in the wild strain are observed. <lb/>TLC analysis of the pteridines showed the differences in the qualitative and quantitative <lb/>compounds composition between the wild type and mutant strains. The chromatogram <lb/>showed the presence of six spots in the wild type strain and only five spots in the yellow eye <lb/>strain. The white eye strain had only half of the spots present in the wild type strain. It is possi-<lb/>ble that the lack of the yellow colour in the white strain is associated with the lack of ommo-<lb/>chromes and pteridines. <lb/>Spectrophotometric measurement of eye pigments in wild type and mutant <lb/>eyes <lb/>Spectrophotometry analysis of absorbance pattern of the ommochromes solution showed two <lb/>distinct peaks of absorbance: a large peak at 280 nm and a much smaller peak at 400 nm. For <lb/>both of these peaks, the absorbency values are lower for the mutant strains than for the black <lb/>strain. These results correspond with thin layer chromatography results: more pigments bands <lb/>are present in the eyes of black crickets than in the mutant eyes. (Fig 6A). <lb/>For pteridines, only one absorbance peak was observed. In the black strain, there is an evi-<lb/>dent absorbance peak at 292 nm. The black strain exhibited a two-fold higher absorbance than <lb/>the yellow and white strains, which were both similar to each other. This result does not corre-<lb/>spond with the results of the TLC assay and suggests the presence of other compounds unde-<lb/>tectable by the TLC assay (Fig 6B). <lb/>Statistical analysis reveals quantitative differences between mutant strains and the wild type <lb/>in pteridines for the absorbance peak value -280nm. There was no difference between mutant <lb/>strains (Fig 7A). For ommochromes, the quantitative analysis for two visible peaks (280 and <lb/>400 nm) was conducted. In both cases, the differences between mutants and the wild type were <lb/>observed. Significant differences between mutants were observed only at 280 nm (Fig 7B and <lb/>7C). <lb/>Spectroflourometric measurement of eye pigments in wild type and mutant <lb/>eyes <lb/>In the fluorometry method only the fluorescent compounds give a positive signal. So, it is pos-<lb/>sible to see which spots on the TCL plate are the fluorescent compounds. We used fluorometry <lb/>to quantitate fluorescent compounds in the wild type and mutant strains. In both pigment <lb/>(pteridines and ommochromes) groups, the baseline fluorescence (solvent fluorescence) was <lb/>low and stable. We found that the different strains differed in the quantity of ommochromes. <lb/>The most profound difference was observable at the 410-490 nm spectrum range. There was a <lb/>strong reduction of overall signal in the yellow and white strain, which corresponded to the <lb/>reduced number of spots on the TLC plate. The highest fluorescence was observed in the black <lb/>strain, lower in the yellow strain and the lowest in the white strain. Fluorescent emission in the <lb/>white strain was residual and close to the background emission. When samples were excited <lb/>Fig 2. General morphology of the eye of Acheta domesticus.

			<body>with 495 nm wavelength, the white and yellow emission curves overlapped and the signal had <lb/>similar intensity (Fig 8A). <lb/>The fluorescence measurement of pteridines also revealed differences between strains. <lb/>Extracts from the eyes of the yellow strain exhibited much higher fluorescence than that of the <lb/>black strain and also had a different curve shape (Fig 8B). This result can be interpreted as a <lb/>sign of physiological adaptation and is observed in the wavelength range 435-475 nm; proba-<lb/>bly the absence of the brown pigments in the yellow eye caused more intense synthesis of pteri-<lb/>dines to protect the eyes against light. Moreover, the white strain exhibited the lowest signal <lb/>intensity, close to the background. This result confirms reduced content of pteridines in the <lb/>white eye visible on the TLC plate (Fig 5). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study we would like to present the characteristic of yellow and white eye colour mutant <lb/>strains of house cricket (Acheta domesticus).

			<body>data from D. melanogaster eye colour mutants where the content of pteridines and ommo-<lb/>chromes is altered [24]. <lb/>Genetics <lb/>The eye colour mutant individuals were easily distinguishable starting from the first-instar <lb/>nymph stage of development. The crossing experiments demonstrated that the yellow and <lb/>white eye phenotypes were inherited as a simple Mendelian autosomal recessive trait. The <lb/>Mendelian ratio of 3:1 observed for BB x YY, YY x WW crosses and 12:3:1 for BB x WW <lb/>crosses, and Mendelian ratio 1:1 in backcrosses of BY x YY and YW x WW confirmed a single <lb/>gene nature of both traits. The lack of changes in the distribution, regardless of multiple repli-<lb/>cations and sex setups, clearly ruled out that the traits are sex-related. Similar conclusions <lb/>about mutations and sex relation are also true for other hemimetabolous insects [15,17,52]. <lb/>Only in one species of Hemiptera, the eye colour mutation was sex-linked [16] contrary to D. <lb/>melanogaster where the eye colour mutations are mainly sex-linked [53]. <lb/>The obtained phenotypes and results of BWxBW crosses close to 12:3:1 indicated that the <lb/>insects with the genotype ww/YY, ww/Yy have a black eye phenotype. This also indicates that <lb/>the black eye trait (the presence of dark brown pigments) is connected with the yellow gene <lb/>and masks the white eye phenotype. The white eye phenotype requires the mutation in both <lb/>genes. The lack of the pleiotropy effect indicates a genetic and metabolic independence of both <lb/>Fig 5.

			<body>are well known, there is no information on the relationship between these genes, the eye colour <lb/>and the process of pigment granules formation. Changes were described in other holometabo-<lb/>lous insects [23,50]. So far, there are only two reports describing spontaneous eye colour muta-<lb/>tion in the holometabolous insect (in the honey bee Apis melifera), which affects the structure <lb/>of the ommatidia; the limao mutant (yellow eyes) [50] Chartreuse red (reddish-brown eyes) <lb/>mutant, and laranja (orange eyes) mutant [57]. The analysis of the eye structure in D. melano-<lb/>gaster eye-color mutants (white, scarlet, vermilion, brown) did not show changes in the omma-<lb/>tidia arrangement or ultrastructure [24,58,59]. There are reports about D. melanogaster retina <lb/>degeneration due to the effect of constant light exposure [60-63]. Described modifications <lb/>became aggravated with age. Our study showed that the mutant strains of crickets have no pro-<lb/>found changes in the eye structure. Only the presence of numerous big white vacuoles (pre-<lb/>sumptive autophagosomes) in the white eyes might indicate some differences; probably a <lb/>massive autophagy process within the cells [57]. Simultaneously there are some big white <lb/>spaces between ommatidia, probably lacunae, like in Drosophila white mutant eyes [60]. These <lb/>lacunae may represent the first signs of retinal degeneration. It can suggest some ommatidia <lb/>degradation processes. In light of these observations it will be necessary to analyse the imago <lb/>eye structure during ageing to determine the dynamic of the potential changes with time. <lb/>Cricket mutants from our breeding room had constant access to shelter so they can behaviou-<lb/>rally regulate light exposure. It would be interesting to check if this factor can increase eye <lb/>degeneration in crickets. <lb/>Fig 7.

			<body>In the light of the discussed results, the presented mutants can be a source of new informa-<lb/>tion about genes, proteins and processes related to the development and function of the com-<lb/>pound eye in insects. They may also help to link the role of granules and their pigments to the <lb/>development and metabolism of the eye, as this aspect is generally overlooked. It will also <lb/>allow assessing the influence of the composition of the pigments on physiology and percep-<lb/>tions in eye colour mutants. <lb/>Eye pigments <lb/>There is a general belief that the colour of insect eyes is mainly determined by the type of <lb/>ommochromes [64-66]. However, many studies indicate that eye pigmentation is a cumulative <lb/>effect of the interplay between various ommochrome and pteridine pigments [4,41,67]. We <lb/>show here that the wild-type eye contains both types of pigments. We also show that the white <lb/>eye mutants have reduced amounts of pteridines and ommochromes in comparison to the <lb/>wild-type. Consistent with lower pigment levels in the mutants, there is a reduction in the <lb/>number of pigment granules in the yellow eye strain, and a complete absence of granules in <lb/>the white eye strain. However, it is still unknown if the lower amount of pigments leads to a <lb/>reduced number of pigment granules or vice versa. <lb/>All three methods of analysis applied here showed that the content and composition of the <lb/>ommochromes differs between cricket strains. There is a significant difference in the quantity <lb/>of eye pigments and the identity of pteridines and ommochrome pigments. Especially, the lack <lb/>of brown pigments, i.e. xanthomatin, which give the cricket eyes a distinctive dark brown col-<lb/>our, seems important [68]. The yellow eye phenotype results from the lack of xanthommatin, <lb/>which masks yellow pigment (xanthopterin) in the wild type eye. In the white eye all the colour <lb/>pigments (in visible light) are absent. What is interesting is the effect of much higher fluores-<lb/>cence of pteridines extracted from the yellow mutant eye than that of the black strain (Fig 8B) <lb/>the same as bigger areas of some spots on TLC plates (Table 3). The described effect is espe-<lb/>cially strong in pteridines from both mutants strains. This result can be interpreted as physio-<lb/>logical adaptation. Probably the absence of the brown pigments in the yellow eye caused more <lb/>intense synthesis of pteridines to protect eyes against light. The second possible explanation is <lb/>an accumulation of intermediate pigments as the effect of the enzyme mutation. There is no <lb/>information about similar effects in literature. This, together with the lack of pteridine pig-<lb/>ments, suggest the relationship of the mutated gene with both synthesis pathways of ommo-<lb/>chromes and pteridines at the substrate level [24,35]. <lb/>The results regarding the content of pigments obtained using the described methods indi-<lb/>cate their unevenness with respect to each other. In several articles, the quantitative analysis of <lb/>the content of pigments in extracts is carried out using only spectrophotometry [52,69]. Our <lb/>results obtained from pteridine samples clearly indicate differences between methods, espe-<lb/>cially in the comparisons between the strains. In the case of the yellow strain, the accumulation <lb/>of pigments can be seen in fluorometry, while similar results cannot be obtained using spectro-<lb/>photometry (absorbance). Similarly, for the white strain, fluorometry shows a much lower <lb/>content of pigments than spectrophotometry. Therefore, we believe that to compare the con-<lb/>tent of fluorescent pigments in extracts, spectrofluorometry or TLC is more suitable than spec-<lb/>trophotometry. We also believe that for a more complete picture, at least two out of three <lb/>methods should be used in such analyses. It also seems crucial to measure the whole fluorimet-<lb/>ric spectra and not only report the single peak values, which gives a fuller picture of the sample <lb/>pigment composition [15,17]. <lb/>There is a considerable number of genes and proteins related to the eye pigments synthesis <lb/>pathways. The three main genes associated with the changes in eye colour, localised in the fruit <lb/></body>

			<body>fly genome, are white, brown and cardinal. Proteins encoded by the white gene form a trans-<lb/>porter complex with the proteins encoded by the other two genes, respectively for the trypto-<lb/>phan and guanine metabolites [5]. However, current knowledge in this area points to <lb/>numerous genes associated with these pathways, the mutation of which can lead to colour <lb/>changes in the insects&apos;eyes. It is difficult to precisely place the eye colour mutation within <lb/>those pathways. Moreover, due to the evolutionary divergence of homo-and holometabolous <lb/>insects, there are unquestionably significant differences in their ontogenesis and physiology. <lb/>The comparison of the mRNA sequence of selected genes, such as white, brown, vermilion, cin-<lb/>nabar, cardinal, scarlet from Gryllus bimaculatus (Asgard http://asgard.rc.fas.harvard.edu date <lb/>of access: 08.02.2018) and D. melanogaster revealed a low sequence similarity between these <lb/>orthologues. This suggests a low degree of similarity in eye pigments profiles between holo-<lb/>and hemimetabolous insects. <lb/>D. melanogaster is a model insect whose genes, enzymes and molecules involved in the eye <lb/>colour phenotype are well known. Much less is known about eye-colour mutants in other than <lb/>fruit fly insects. Even less is known about the relationship of tryptophan and guanine metabo-<lb/>lism pathways and their intermediate metabolites with insect physiology and behaviour <lb/>[10,66,70-72]. The available data show that insects with disrupted tryptophan pathway, thus <lb/>visual mutants, may be models for mammalian diseases and pathophysiology such as autism, <lb/>diabetes, Parkinson&apos;s, and Alzheimer&apos;s diseases [1]. Compounds like kynurenine or biopterin <lb/>are involved in pathophysiological processes [73-75]. Thanks to these and similar discoveries, <lb/>a cricket may become a useful model used in future genetic and physiological research. <lb/>Because of its relatively large size and hemimetabolous type of development, the cricket may <lb/>become an informative alternative to the fruit fly model [45]. <lb/></body>
