			Abstract <lb/>Microorganisms efficiently coordinate phenotype expressions through a decision-making <lb/>process known as quorum sensing (QS). We investigated QS amongst heterogeneously <lb/>distributed microbial aggregates under various flow conditions using a process-driven numerical <lb/>model. Model simulations assess the conditions suitable for QS induction and quantify the <lb/>importance of advective transport of signaling molecules. In addition, advection dilutes signaling <lb/>molecules so that faster flow conditions require higher microbial densities, faster signal <lb/>production rates, or higher sensitivities to signaling molecules to induce QS. However, <lb/>autoinduction of signal production can substantially increase the transport distance of signaling <lb/>molecules in both upstream and downstream directions. We present approximate analytical <lb/>solutions of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation that describe the concentration profiles of <lb/>signaling molecules for a wide range of flow and reaction rates. These empirical relationships, <lb/>which predict the distribution of dissolved solutes following zero-order production kinetics along <lb/>pore channels, allow to quantitatively estimate the effective communication distances amongst <lb/>multiple microbial aggregates without further numerical simulations. <lb/>Author Summary <lb/>Microbes can interact with their surrounding environments by producing and sensing small <lb/>signaling molecules. When the microbes experience a high enough concentration of the signaling <lb/>molecules, they express certain phenotypes which is often energetically expensive. This <lb/>microbial decision-making process known as quorum sensing (QS) has been understood to <lb/>confer evolutionary benefits. However, it is still not completely understood how transport of the <lb/>produced signaling molecules affects QS. Using a mathematical approach investigating QS <lb/>across a range of environmentally relevant flow conditions, we find that advective transport <lb/>promotes QS downstream yet also dilutes the concentration of signaling molecules. We quantify <lb/>the importance of microbial cell location with respect to both other microbes and flow direction. <lb/>By analyzing complex numerical simulation results, we provide analytical approximations to <lb/>assess the distribution of signaling molecules in pore channels across a range of flow and <lb/>reaction conditions. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Microorganisms preferentially reside on solid surfaces, which often leads to a closer <lb/>proximity of neighboring cells than when in a planktonic form [1]. At elevated cell densities, <lb/>microorganisms need to efficiently coordinate the expression of energetically expensive <lb/>phenotypes, such as biofilm development, exoenzyme production, and microbial dispersal. <lb/>Efficiency is achieved by producing and detecting relatively cheap signaling molecules which <lb/>regulate the phenotype expression only when a sufficient signal concentration has been reached <lb/>[2]. This microbial decision-making process called &quot;quorum sensing (QS)&quot; was originally <lb/>understood as a cell-to-cell communication to identify conspecific population density and <lb/>accomplish cooperative behaviors [3]. However, a number of studies have indicated that QS is <lb/>not necessarily a social trait [4,5] and depends not only on the population but also on the spatial <lb/>distribution of microbial cells [6,7]. These observations led to an alternative QS concept in which <lb/>QS depends strictly on the local concentration of signaling molecules [8,9]. This suggests that, to <lb/>understand QS processes, an integrative approach is required analyzing a multitude of factors <lb/>including microbial density [3], production and decay kinetics [10,11], and transport of signaling <lb/>molecules through advection and diffusion [4], as well as the spatial distribution of <lb/>microorganisms [7]. Thus, spatial constraints and responses may be as important as other <lb/>biological considerations for the evolution and maintenance of QS. This idea is known to be true <lb/>in biofilms where cooperative strategies are able to evolve if cooperators are spatially aggregated <lb/>[12]. <lb/>Individual microbial cells synthesize and release signaling molecules at a basal rate. At low <lb/>population densities, the concentration of signaling molecules remains low as it degrades both <lb/>biotically and abiotically [11,13]. At a sufficiently high microbial population density, however, <lb/>the extracellular concentration of signaling molecules reaches a threshold concentration that <lb/>activates gene and phenotypes expression [9]. When QS regulates the production of costly public <lb/>goods, this balances production cost and the overall benefit [27,35,36], while under nutrient <lb/>limited conditions, QS can regulate microbial dispersal (e.g. [37,38]), improving chances of <lb/>survival. QS induction also often upregulates genes controlling production of signaling <lb/>molecules resulting in enhanced signal production [10,14]. Such autoinduction has been thought <lb/>to confer evolutionary stability and fitness advantages [15-17], but its effects on neighboring <lb/>microbial aggregates and evolutionary benefits in a spatial context have not be fully understood. <lb/>QS induction is affected by mass transport characteristics controlling the spatial distribution <lb/>of signaling molecules. In a confined space, even a single microbial cell can be QS induced if the <lb/>signaling molecules accumulate to sufficiently high concentration in the confined space [5]. <lb/>However, higher population densities are required for QS induction in a large open space <lb/>because the signaling molecules are diluted due to diffusive loss to the surrounding medium <lb/>[7,18]. Advection may dilute the signaling molecules more effectively than diffusion and repress <lb/>QS induction [19-23]. The signaling molecules transported either via advection or diffusion can <lb/>induce QS in neighboring cells if they receive enough signaling molecules. The distance between <lb/>two QS induced microbial cells or aggregates is referred to as the &quot;calling distance&quot; [24], and has <lb/>been reported to be 5 -78 m between individual cells [24] and ~180 m between microbial <lb/>aggregates [25]. The dependence of QS processes on advection and diffusion suggests that <lb/>transport regimes affect calling distances, highlighting the importance of relative positioning of <lb/>microorganisms coupled with the mass transport characteristics of a habitat. <lb/>Here, we evaluate the effect of combined diffusive and advective transport on QS processes <lb/>in environmentally relevant conditions using a reactive transport modeling approach. The <lb/>advection-diffusion-reaction equation (ADRE) was nondimensionalized to capture the <lb/>characteristic properties of QS systems (i.e. effects of the rate of signaling molecule production, <lb/>mass transport, and spatial distribution of microbial aggregates) and used to formulate empirical <lb/>expressions describing concentration profiles of signaling molecules under various flow <lb/>conditions. Using these relationships, we evaluate calling distances and threshold biochemical <lb/>conditions for QS induction of a single microbial aggregate under various flow conditions. Then, <lb/>we investigate QS interactions between heterogeneously distributed microbial aggregates. <lb/>Finally, we demonstrate the importance of autoinduction for coordinated microbial behaviors in <lb/>advection-dominated environments. <lb/>

            Process description <lb/>The distribution of signaling molecules is described by <lb/>∂𝐴 <lb/>∂𝑡 <lb/>+ 𝐮 • ∇𝐴 = 𝐷∇ <lb/>2 <lb/>𝐴 + (1 + 𝐹𝐻[𝐴 -𝜃])𝑘𝐵 <lb/>(1) <lb/>where is a concentration of signaling molecules, is the flow velocity vector representing <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>𝐮 <lb/>parabolic Poiseuille flow (see the section &quot;Numerical method&quot;), and is the molecular <lb/>𝐷 <lb/>diffusivity. The last term on the right-hand side of the equation represents the production rate of <lb/>signaling molecules. QS induction often displays a switch-like behavior [9,26,27], which is <lb/>represented in the model by a step function with a higher signal production rate above the <lb/>threshold concentration of signaling molecule: <lb/>𝐻[𝐴 -𝜃] = { 1, (𝐴 ≥ 𝜃), <lb/>0, (𝐴 &lt; 𝜃). <lb/>(2) <lb/>and F represents a multiplication factor. Here F is set to either 10 to reflects the magnitude of <lb/>autoinduced signal production [10] or 0 in the absence of autoinduction. is the QS induction <lb/>𝜃 <lb/>threshold, is the basal production rate constant of signaling molecules, and is the microbial <lb/>𝑘 <lb/>𝐵 <lb/>density. Note that we are ignoring the breakdown of signaling molecules [28], limiting us to <lb/>settings where production and transport are the dominant processes. <lb/>To describe the characteristic properties of a microbial system across various flow and <lb/>reaction conditions, Eq. 1 was recast by introducing dimensionless quantities <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>𝐴 = <lb/>𝐴 <lb/>𝜃 𝑡 = <lb/>𝐷𝑡 <lb/>𝑙 <lb/>2 ∇ = <lb/>, <lb/>, u = , where is a characteristic length (i.e. the width of the flow channel), is a <lb/>∇𝑙 𝐵 = <lb/>𝐵 <lb/>𝐵 𝜃 <lb/>𝐮 <lb/>𝑈 <lb/>𝑙 <lb/>𝑈 <lb/>characteristic fluid velocity (here, the average pore fluid velocity), and <lb/>is a threshold biomass <lb/>𝐵 𝜃 <lb/>density required for QS induction, resulting in: <lb/>∂𝐴 <lb/>∂𝑡 <lb/>+ 𝑃𝑒𝐮 • ∇𝐴 = ∇ 2 𝐴 + 𝐷𝑎 <lb/>(3) <lb/>This nondimensionalized ADRE is fully characterized by the Péclet number, expressing the <lb/>magnitude of advective flow relative to diffusion ( <lb/>), and the diffusive Damköhler <lb/>𝑃𝑒 = <lb/>𝑈𝑙 <lb/>𝐷 <lb/>number, comparing reaction to diffusion ( <lb/>; where <lb/>). A system <lb/>𝐷𝑎 = <lb/>𝑘 &apos; 𝐵𝑙 <lb/>2 <lb/>𝜃𝐷 <lb/>𝑘 &apos; = (1 + 𝐹𝐻[𝐴 -𝜃])𝑘𝐵 𝜃 <lb/>with high Da -either due to high k&apos; (i.e. fast signal production), high B (i.e. high microbial <lb/>density), or low (i.e. high sensitivity to signaling molecules) -is more likely to be QS induced. <lb/>𝜃 <lb/>An important property of Eq. 3 is that its solution linearly scales in Da. For example, if Da is <lb/>increased 2-fold at a fixed Pe condition, the concentrations of signaling molecule are doubled. <lb/>This linearity allows to calculate the concentration distribution of signaling molecules for any Da <lb/>from a single simulation result with an arbitrary Da at a given Pe. However, this simple approach <lb/>cannot be applied to the flow conditions because the solution is not linear in Pe. Therefore, <lb/>multiple numerical simulations were carried out with 24 Pe conditions (Pe  {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, <lb/>0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10}) while Da was fixed at 5. <lb/>For the 2D simulations in a pore channel shown below, the flow field was established by <lb/>imposing pressures at in-and outlet and no flow conditions at the top and bottom boundaries, <lb/>resulting in a flow from left to right. Fixed concentration (A| left-boundary, x=0 = 0) and no-gradient <lb/>(A/x| right-boundary, x=4 = 0) boundary conditions were imposed at the inlet and outlet boundaries, <lb/>with no-flux at the top and bottom boundaries, respectively. All simulations were run to steady <lb/>state. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>QS processes of a single microbial aggregate <lb/>The effect of various flow conditions on the distribution of signaling molecules (A) produced <lb/>from a single microbial aggregate located at x = 1 was investigated under various Pe conditions <lb/>(0.5 ≤ Pe ≤ 10) while Da was fixed at 5 (Fig. 1). The QS induction enhancing the signal <lb/>production rate was not considered. <lb/>Fig. 1. Concentration fields of signal concentration A at Da = 5 and (a) Pe = 1, (b) Pe = 5, and <lb/>(c) Pe = 10, without autoinduction (F = 0). Note the difference in scale on the horizontal axis. <lb/>The signal concentration fields developed under various advective flows show maximum <lb/>concentrations (A max = A(x=1)) decreasing with increasing Pe (i.e. faster advective flow): A max <lb/>decreased from 1.68 (Pe = 1) to 1.35 (Pe = 5) and 1.21 (Pe = 10). However, A max of all of the <lb/>simulations with Da = 5 exceeded 1(i.e. ≥ ), indicating the potential for QS induction. The <lb/>𝐴 𝜃 <lb/>threshold Da for QS induction (Da  ), where A max = 1, can easily be computed using the linearity <lb/>of the nondimensionalized ADRE in Da (Eq. 3). For example, Da  at Pe = 1 was calculated by <lb/>dividing Da = 5 by its corresponding A max = 1.68 which resulted in Da  = 2.98. Thus, at Pe = 1, <lb/>conditions for which Da ≥ 2.98 lead to or exceed the concentration of signaling molecules <lb/>needed for QS induction. Fig. 2 shows the calculated Da  for each simulated Pe condition. <lb/>Fig. 2. The relationship between the threshold Da for QS induction (Da  ) and Pe. The simulation <lb/>results (block dots) were fitted using the power regression (red line; Eq. 4). <lb/>The regression analysis revealed that the simulated Da  for QS induction varies as a function <lb/>of Pe following the power law: <lb/>𝐷𝑎 𝜃 = 1.3812𝑃𝑒 0.2626 + 1.592 <lb/>(4) <lb/>The increasing Da  along with the increasing Pe indicates higher Da (i.e. higher microbial <lb/>density (B), higher signal production rate constant (k&apos;), or lower QS induction threshold ( )) is <lb/>𝜃 <lb/>required for QS induction under higher Pe. This result corresponds to the observed repressed QS <lb/>induction under the presence of advection [19,21,23]. Eq. 4 was further evaluated by applying <lb/>the experimentally measured QS parameters of Pseudomonas putida ( = 2.3  10 -10 nmol/cell/h, <lb/>𝑘 <lb/>and = 70 nmol/L [10]) in a flow system where = 1 cm and = 3.0  10 -10 m 2 /s [29]. Our <lb/>𝜃 <lb/>𝑙 <lb/>𝐷 <lb/>results show <lb/>of 9.77, 12.2, and 13.5  10 6 cells/mL at Pe = 1, 5, and 10, respectively. If Eq. 4 <lb/>𝐵 𝜃 <lb/>is extrapolated to diffusion only transport condition (Pe = 0, Da  = 1.592), <lb/>is estimated as <lb/>𝐵 𝜃 <lb/>5.23  10 6 cells/mL which largely agree with the experimental observation of 2.69 ~ 6.23  10 6 <lb/>cells/mL where signal concentration starts to show a strong spike (Table S1 in [10]). <lb/>In addition to reducing A max , advection also influenced the spatial distribution of signaling <lb/>molecules. We define the &quot;transport distance&quot; (d) as the distance between the point of production <lb/>(x 0 ) and the point (x 1 ) where the signal concentration reaches a certain value A * (i.e. d = |x 0 -x 1 |), <lb/>distinguishing it from the &quot;calling distance&quot; between two QS induced microbial cells or <lb/>aggregates. If the signal transport occurred only through diffusion, transport distances would be <lb/>isotropic [7]. However, advection resulted in anisotropic concentration distribution where <lb/>upstream transport distances (d up ) are much shorter than the downstream distances (d dn ). <lb/>Moreover, fast advective flows (i.e. high Pe) reduced overall transport distances which are <lb/>illustrated in Fig. 1a-c as the shrinking areas covered by contour lines. For example, the <lb/>(nondimensional) transport distances to the location where A 1 = 0.4 are d up = 0.035 and d dn = <lb/>0.068 at Pe = 1 and Da = 5 (Fig. 1a). These values decrease to d up = 0.018 and d dn = 0.043 at Pe <lb/>= 5 (Fig. 1b) and to d up = 0.013 and d dn = 0.036 at Pe = 10 (Fig. 1c). <lb/>Empirical approximation of concentration profiles <lb/>Obtaining transport distances for different Pe conditions requires running numerical <lb/>simulations for each of the corresponding Pe. However, this may be avoided if we can express <lb/>the concentration profiles as a function of Pe. For this purpose, parametric regression analysis <lb/>was applied to the numerically obtained concentration profiles along the bottom of the flow <lb/>channel (Fig. 3). <lb/>Fig. 3. (a) Simulated (dots) and reconstructed (lines) concentration profiles along the bottom of <lb/>the flow channel (y = 0.001) at Pe = 1 and Da = Da  = 2.98. The upstream (x ≤ 1; A up (x); solid <lb/>line) and downstream (x &gt; 1; A dn (x); dashed line) concentration profiles were obtained from Eqs. <lb/>
            5 and 6, respectively. (b-d) The coefficients for A up (x) (a up , b up , and c up ) and A dn (x) (a dn , b dn , and <lb/>c dn ) obtained from the parametric regressions of the simulated concentration profiles at each <lb/>simulated Pe conditions with Eq. 5 (black dots) and Eq. 6 (white dots), respectively. The solid <lb/>and dashed lines are the exponential (Eqs. 7-9) and power fits (Eqs. 10-12) of the estimated <lb/>coefficients as a function of Pe. <lb/>Several parametric regression models (linear, power, exponential, and polynomial models) <lb/>were tested to the upstream (A up (x); 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) and downstream (A dn (x); 1 &lt; x ≤ 4) signal <lb/>concentration profiles. Among the tested regression models, the exponential (Eq. 5) and power-<lb/>law models (Eq. 6) provided the best fit for log-transformed upstream and downstream signal <lb/>concentration profiles, respectively. In the regression analysis of upstream profiles, only the <lb/>locations where A(x) &gt; 0.001 were used to improve the fitting quality and the signal <lb/>concentration at x = 1 was fixed as 1. The additional regression analysis was then carried out for <lb/>the coefficients (a, b, and c) obtained from simulated profiles at 24 Pe conditions to construct a <lb/>relationship between the coefficients and Pe (Fig. 3b-d). The exponential and power-law models <lb/>provided the best fit for the upstream (Eqs. 7-9) and downstream coefficients (Eqs. 10-12), <lb/>respectively: <lb/>𝐴 𝑢𝑝 (𝑥)| 𝑥 ≤ 1 = exp (𝑎 𝑢𝑝 (𝑥 𝑏 𝑢𝑝 -𝑥 𝑐 𝑢𝑝 )) <lb/>(5) <lb/>𝐴 𝑑𝑛 (𝑥)| 𝑥 &gt; 1 = exp (𝑎 𝑑𝑛 ln (𝑥) 𝑏 𝑑𝑛 + 𝑐 𝑑𝑛 ) <lb/>(6) <lb/>where A up and A dn are 0 in the down-and up-stream directions, respectively, and <lb/>𝑎 𝑢𝑝 = 0.376exp ( -2.5975𝑃𝑒) + 2.7165exp (0.0244𝑃𝑒) <lb/>(7) <lb/>𝑏 𝑢𝑝 = 20.311exp (0.0115𝑃𝑒) -13.38exp ( -0.6121𝑃𝑒) <lb/>(8) <lb/>𝑐 𝑢𝑝 =-7.1289exp (0.0348𝑃𝑒) + 5.9469exp ( -0.4272𝑃𝑒) <lb/>(9) <lb/>𝑎 𝑑𝑛 = 8.6156𝑃𝑒 -0.0668 -13.3056 <lb/>(10) <lb/>𝑏 𝑑𝑛 = 0.1051𝑃𝑒 -0.2522 + 0.1082 <lb/>(11) <lb/>𝑐 𝑑𝑛 =-7.5322𝑃𝑒 -0.0464 + 8.7195 <lb/>(12) <lb/>Eqs. 5 and 6 can be used as approximations of the concentration profiles along a pore <lb/>channel without running simulations for various Pe conditions, with the microbial aggregate <lb/>located at x = 1. Due to the linearity in Da, the concentration profiles at different Da conditions <lb/>can be calculated simply by multiplying Da/Da  to Eqs. 5 and 6, so that <lb/>𝐴(𝑥) = <lb/>𝐷𝑎 <lb/>𝐷𝑎 𝜃 <lb/>(𝐴 𝑢𝑝 (𝑥) + 𝐴 𝑑𝑛 (𝑥)) <lb/>(13) <lb/>These analytical expressions are applicable not only to QS but also to other chemical <lb/>processes subject to zero-order production reactions. They are valid when the microbial <lb/>aggregates have a negligible impact on flow fields, which is a reasonable approximation for low <lb/>microbial density conditions. However, it may not hold when biomass grow large and perturb <lb/>flows substantially which would require models fully resolving nonlinear feedback between fluid <lb/>flows and transport phenomena [30-32]. The equations become less accurate at low Pe as under <lb/>low flow conditions, the estimates from Eq. 13 in a flow channel with a small width (i.e. low 𝑙 <lb/>and Pe) could underestimate the actual concentration because the confined channel width would <lb/>push the produced chemical further upstream and downstream. <lb/>The effect of QS induced signal production on transport distances <lb/>QS often involves autoinduction which substantially increases signal production rates. The <lb/>effect of autoinduction on transport distances was investigated by using Eq. 13 for the conditions <lb/>without (F = 0; Da = Da  ) and with (F = 10; Da = 11Da  ) enhanced signal production. The <lb/>transport distances from a single microbial aggregate under various Pe were then calculated <lb/>using Eq. 13 for the location x. <lb/>Fig. 4. Upstream (d up ) and downstream (d dn ) transport distances (a) without (F = 0) and (b) <lb/>with (F =10) enhanced signal production for the concentration ratios (0.1 ≤ A/A max ≤ 0.9) at Pe = <lb/>1, 5, and 10. Note the different scale between panels (a) and (b), and between the distances up-<lb/>and downstream from 0 (d up and d dn ) in (b). <lb/>Fig. 4 shows the transport distances without (Fig. 4a) and with (Fig. 4b) the enhanced signal <lb/>production at Pe = 1, 5, and 10. The concentration ratios (0.1 ≤ A/A max ≤ 0.9) were used instead <lb/>of absolute concentrations to generalize transport distances for various Da conditions. For <lb/>example, the transport distance (d A ) for A/A max = 0.5 indicates that A(x 0 +d A ) = 0.5 if Da = Da  <lb/>while A(x 0 +d A ) = 0.05 when Da = 0.1Da  . The consequence of the enhanced signal production <lb/>was the significant increase of d up and d dn . Without the enhanced signal production, d up and d dn <lb/>for A/A max = 0.4 at Pe = 1 were estimated as 0.021 and 0.024, respectively (Fig. 4a). These values <lb/>increased to d up = 0.1 and d dn = 1.28 with the enhanced signal production (Fig. 4b). The <lb/>downstream transport distance of 1.28 is translated into 6.4 mm in a flow channel with = 1 cm. <lb/>𝑙 <lb/>This result is much longer than the generally observed ranges of calling distances [33]. However, <lb/>we emphasize again that the transport distance merely indicates the distance of signaling <lb/>molecules transported from a source location while the calling distance involves QS induced <lb/>microbial cells or aggregates. <lb/>QS induction between spatially distributed multiple microbial aggregates <lb/>QS processes of multiple aggregates were investigated by constructing the concentration <lb/>profiles using Eq. 14. Concentration fields of signaling molecules with multiple microbial <lb/>aggregates can be calculated as the superposition of the concentration profile produced by each <lb/>individual aggregate: <lb/>𝐴(𝑥) = <lb/>𝑛 <lb/>∑ <lb/>𝑖 = 1 <lb/>𝐷𝑎 𝑖 <lb/>𝐷𝑎 𝜃 <lb/>(𝐴 𝑢𝑝 (𝑥 + 𝑑 𝑖0 ) + 𝐴 𝑑𝑛 (𝑥 + 𝑑 𝑖0 )) <lb/>(14) <lb/>where n is the number of aggregates, d i0 is the distance between x i and x 0 (d i0 = x i -x 0 ), x i is the <lb/>location of ith aggregate, x 0 is the reference location (x 0 = 1), Da i is the Da calculated only with <lb/>the density of ith microbial aggregate (i.e. microscopic Da), and A up and A dn are Eqs. 5 and 6, <lb/>respectively. Here, an example system with macroscopic Da (Da T = Da i ) = 3.2Da  consist of <lb/>four aggregates ( 1-4 ) located at x 1 = 0.4, x 2 = 1, x 3 = 1.096, and x 4 = 1.7 with the evenly <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>distributed microscopic Da i (i.e. Da 1 = Da 2 = Da 3 = Da 4 = 0.8Da  ) was tested. In using Eq. 14, <lb/>the profile was first constructed for Da i = Da * that does not consider autoinduction (F = 0). <lb/>Then, if there is an aggregate with A(x i ) ≥ 1, the profile was recalculated with updated Da i = <lb/>(1+F)Da * until all Da i with A ≥ 1 were updated. <lb/>Fig. 5. Concentration profile (a) without (F = 0) and (b) with (F = 10) enhanced signal <lb/>production where four aggregates are located at x 1 = 0.4, x 2 = 1, x 3 = 1.096, and x 4 = 1.7. Black <lb/>dots are the simulated results and the yellow lines represent the profile from Eq. 14. <lb/>The signal concentration profile produced by four aggregates without the enhanced signal <lb/>production (F = 0) illustrates the crucial importance of relative positioning of microbial <lb/>aggregates for QS induction with respect not only to each aggregate but also to the flow direction <lb/>(Fig. 5a). The microscopic Da i was set such that the maximum concentration produced by a <lb/>single aggregate was 0.8, as observed at the most upstream location ( 1 at x 1 = 0.4). But due to <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>transport, the local concentration at 2 reached 0.879, receiving A of 0.048 and 0.031 from 1 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>and 3 , respectively. 3 received slightly less signaling molecules from 1 (A = 0.044) due to the <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>longer distance of 3 than 2 from 1 . However, 2 provided much more signaling molecules (A <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>= 0.157) to 3 than was provided by 3 because of advective flows favoring downstream <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>transport of signaling molecules (Figs. 2 and 4). As a consequence, 3 exceeded the QS <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>threshold (A(x 3 ) = 0.044 from 1 + 0.157 from 2 + 0.8 from 3 + 0 from 4 = 1.001 &gt; 1) while <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>the upstream located 2 did not. The QS induction of 3 demonstrates the importance of <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>transport distances. QS induction was achieved because of the upstream aggregates located <lb/>within the transport distance of 0.696. However, the calling distance would have been estimated <lb/>as the length of a grid voxel (0.002) because only 3 was QS induced. Therefore, considering <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>only the calling distance could lead to the wrong conclusion that the local Da condition at 3 (i.e. <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>Da 3 = 0.8Da  ) is a sufficient condition for QS induction. Although 4 did not reach the QS <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>induction threshold, it received A from all the other aggregates resulting in a concentration (A(x 4 ) <lb/>= 0.029 + 0.044 + 0.048 + 0.8 = 0.921) that was higher than at 2 despite the longest separation <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>distance from other aggregates. <lb/>Accounting for QS induction (F = 10) increased the transport distances and hence induced <lb/>other aggregates (Fig. 5b). With the same spatial distribution, QS-induced 3 produced signaling <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>molecules much more and faster (i.e. k &apos; = 11 and Da 3 = 8.8Da  ) and provided more signaling <lb/>𝑘 <lb/>molecules to 2 . As a result, A(x 2 ) exceeded the QS threshold (0.048 + 0.8 + 0.335 + 0 = 1.183). <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>The QS induction of 2 and 3 resulted in the final signal concentrations of A(x 2 ) = 9.183 (= <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>0.048 + 8.8 + 0.035 + 0) and A(x 3 ) = 10.569 (= 0.044 + 1.725 + 8.8 + 0). While 4 still did not <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>contribute signaling molecules to any of upstream aggregates, enhanced contribution from 2 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>and 3 QS induced 4 , A(x 4 ) = 9.839 (= 0.029 + 0.48 + 0.53 + 8.8). Despite increased transport <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>distances by QS induction, 1 was still too far away from the other aggregates thus the signal <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>concentration at 1 remained unchanged A(x 1 ) = 0.8. As a result of the QS induction of 2-4 , Da T <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>had increased from the initial 3.2Da  (= 0.8Da   4) to 27.2Da  (= 0.8Da  + 3  11  0.8Da  ). <lb/>This example illustrates the importance of enhanced signal production on the spatial <lb/>propagation of QS induction. While only 3 experienced signaling molecule levels that could <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>induce QS when all the aggregates produce signaling molecules at the basal production rate, the <lb/>enhanced signal production of 3 when considering induced production (F = 10) provided more <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>signaling molecules to its adjacent microbial aggregates and resulted in the QS induction of <lb/>neighboring aggregates, 2 and 4 . It may be counterintuitive that the upstream-located 2 was <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>also QS-induced by the contribution from 3 despite the contracted upstream transport distances <lb/>𝔸 <lb/>under the presence of advective flows. This result shows that the enhanced signal production can <lb/>overcome the influence of advection and promote QS induction, and provide a way to provoke <lb/>upstream microbial aggregates, for example, to slow down the substrate consumption to ensure <lb/>efficient resource utilization in crowded environments [34]. <lb/>

            Implications <lb/>This study has demonstrated that advection and the enhanced signal production can determine <lb/>the spatial extent of QS induction. Although QS mediated gene expression has been understood <lb/>as evolutionarily beneficial collective behaviors, long transport distances observed in study <lb/>suggests that it may not be always true. The transport of signaling molecules, especially in <lb/>downstream direction, combined with enhanced signal production, suggests that QS induction <lb/>can be decoupled from microbial density. In the above example, any microbial cell located where <lb/>A &gt; 1 (e.g. A(x = 2.5) = 1.05 in Fig. 5b) would have been QS-induced, independent of the local <lb/>cell density. This could lead to detrimental impacts on a microbial population, unless there are <lb/>other counteracting mechanisms such as differential QS induction sensitivity to signal <lb/>concentration even in within a clonal population [25] or biofilm formation modifying local <lb/>transport characteristics [39]. Future investigations should explicitly examine the evolutionary <lb/>consequences of QS strategies in spatially heterogeneous environments under advective-<lb/>diffusion-reaction dynamics. <lb/>Numerical methods <lb/>We used the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to implement a numerical model for the <lb/>transport of signaling molecules due to diffusion and advection. The LB method is a mesoscopic <lb/>approach solving the Boltzmann equation across a defined set of particles which recovers the <lb/>macroscopic Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and ADRE [40]. First, we obtained the flow field by <lb/>solving the particle distribution function f: <lb/>𝑓 𝑖 (𝐫 + 𝒄 𝑖 Δ𝑡,𝑡 + Δ𝑡) = 𝑓 𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) + <lb/>Δ𝑡 <lb/>𝜏 (𝑓 𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) -𝑓 𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡)) <lb/>(14) <lb/>where particles f i (r,t) travel in the direction i with the lattice velocity c i (c 0 = (0,0), c 1 = (1,0), c 2 <lb/>= (0,1), c 3 = (-1,0) , c 4 = (0,-1) , c 5 = (1,1) , c 6 = (-1,1) , c 7 = (-1,-1) , c 8 = (1,-1)) to a new position <lb/>r+ c i t after a time step t. The relaxation time () was described by the commonly used <lb/>Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision operator [41] and the D2Q9 lattice with the corresponding <lb/>equilibrium distribution function: <lb/>𝑓 𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) = 𝜔 𝑖 𝜌 ( 1 + 𝐮 • 𝐜 𝑖 <lb/>𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 <lb/>+ <lb/>(𝐮 • 𝐜 𝑖 ) 𝟐 <lb/>2𝑐 4 <lb/>𝑠 <lb/>-<lb/>𝐮 • 𝐮 <lb/>2𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 ) <lb/>(15) <lb/>where  i are lattice weights ( 0 = 4/9,  1-4 = 1/9,  5-8 = 1/36), c s is a lattice dependent constant <lb/>(here, = 1/3), and u is the macroscopic flow velocity. The moments of the discretized <lb/>𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 <lb/>mesoscopic particles retrieve the macroscopic density ( =  f i ) and momentum (u =  c i f i ). <lb/>The Chapman-Enskog expansion showed that this LB approach recovers the incompressible <lb/>NSE with the viscosity <lb/>[40]. <lb/>𝜈 = 𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 ( 𝜏 -Δ𝑡 <lb/>2 ) <lb/>Once the flow field was obtained, we simulated solute transport with a particle distribution <lb/>function g, using the regularized LB algorithm (RLB) for numerical accuracy [42,43] and the <lb/>D2Q5 lattice for numerical efficiency [44]: <lb/>g 𝑖 (𝐫 + 𝒄 𝑖 Δ𝑡,𝑡 + Δ𝑡) = g 𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) + ( 1 -Δ𝑡 <lb/>𝜏 ) <lb/>𝜔 𝑖 <lb/>2𝑐 4 <lb/>𝑠 <lb/>𝑸 𝑖 :𝚷 𝑛𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 + Ω 𝑅𝑋𝑁 <lb/>𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) <lb/>(16) <lb/>where c i are the lattice velocities (c 0 = (0,0), c 1 = (1,0), c 2 = (0,1), c 3 = (-1,0) , c 4 = (0,-1) , c 5 = <lb/>(1,1)) corresponding to the lattice weights  i ( 0 = 1/3,  1-4 = 1/6), and Q i : <lb/>is the tensor <lb/>𝚷 𝑛𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 <lb/>contraction between the two tensors Q i = <lb/>and <lb/>. <lb/>𝒄 𝑖 • 𝒄 𝑇 <lb/>𝑖 -𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 𝑰 <lb/>𝚷 𝑛𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑖 = ∑ <lb/>𝑗 𝒄 𝑖 • 𝒄 𝑇 <lb/>𝑖 (g 𝑗 (𝐫,𝑡) -g 𝑒𝑞 <lb/>𝑗 (𝐫,𝑡)) <lb/>The reaction term in the Eq. 3 describes the production of signaling molecules: <lb/>Ω 𝑅𝑋𝑁 <lb/>𝑖 (𝐫,𝑡) = Δ𝑡𝜔 𝑖 (1 + 𝐹𝐻[𝐴 -𝜃])𝑘𝐵 <lb/>(17) <lb/>With the imposed flow field from Eq. 1, the LB transport solver (Eq. 3) recovers the ADRE (Eq. <lb/>1) with the diffusivity <lb/>. <lb/>𝐷 = 𝑐 2 <lb/>𝑠 ( 𝜏 -Δ𝑡 <lb/>2 ) <lb/>Simulations were conducted for a 2D flow channel of non-dimensional length of 4 and a <lb/>width of 2, discretized with 2000  1000 grid elements. The flow field (Eq. 1) was generated by <lb/>imposing fixed pressures at inlet (x = 0) and outlet (x = 4) with no flow boundaries in both <lb/>normal and tangential direction at the bottom (y = 0) and top (y = 2) of the domain resulting in <lb/>parabolic Poiseuille flows. Simulations were carried out under low Mach numbers (Ma ≪ 1) to <lb/>ensure incompressible flow conditions [40]. <lb/></body>
