			Abstract <lb/> The current system of so-called institutional repositories, even if it has been a sensible <lb/>response at an earlier stage, may not answer the needs of the scholarly community, <lb/>scientific communication and accompanied stakeholders in a sustainable way. However, <lb/>having a robust repository infrastructure is essential to academic work. Yet, current <lb/>institutional solutions, even when networked in a country or across Europe, have largely <lb/>failed to deliver. Consequently, a new path for a more robust infrastructure and larger <lb/>repositories is explored to create superior services that support the academy. A future <lb/>organisation of publication repositories is advocated that is based upon macroscopic <lb/>academic settings providing a critical mass of interest as well as organisational <lb/>coherence. Such a macro-unit may be geographical (a coherent national scheme), <lb/>institutional (a large research organisation or a consortium thereof) or thematic (a <lb/>specific research field organising itself in the domain of publication repositories). <lb/>The argument proceeds as follows: firstly, while institutional open access mandates <lb/>have brought some content into open access, the important mandates are those of the <lb/>funders and these are best supported by a single infrastructure and large repositories, <lb/>which incidentally enhances the value of the collection (while a transfer to institutional <lb/>repositories would diminish the value). Secondly, we compare and contrast a system <lb/>based on central research publication repositories with the notion of a network of <lb/>institutional repositories to illustrate that across central dimensions of any repository <lb/>solution the institutional model is more cumbersome and less likely to achieve a high <lb/>level of service.

			<body> Publication repositories at the crossroads <lb/> A series of developments over the past two decades has shaped scientific <lb/>communication such that parallel to the long-standing tradition of scientific publishing, <lb/>online environments have been set up to provide fast, wide and free access to content by <lb/>means of publication repositories. This paper posits a crossroads for publication <lb/>repositories, tracing contextual factors that explain why and how it is necessary for us to <lb/>reconsider the basic parameters of how publication repositories should evolve further. 1 <lb/> The current system of so-called institutional repositories, even if it has been a sensible <lb/>response at an earlier stage, may not answer the needs of the scholarly community, <lb/>scientific communication and accompanied stakeholders in a sustainable way. However, <lb/>having a robust repository infrastructure is essential to academic work. Yet, current <lb/>institutional solutions, even when networked in a country or across Europe, have largely <lb/>failed to deliver (cf. Basefsky 2009). Consequently, a new path for a more robust <lb/>infrastructure and larger repositories is explored to create superior services that support <lb/>the academy. A future organisation of publication repositories is advocated that is based <lb/>upon macroscopic academic settings providing a critical mass of interest as well as <lb/>organisational coherence. Such a macro-unit may be geographical (a coherent national <lb/>scheme), institutional (a large research organisation or a consortium thereof) or thematic <lb/>(a specific research field organising itself in the domain of publication repositories). <lb/>We are concerned with crossroads. Therefore this paper will neither trace the history of <lb/>online scientific communication nor consider the debate on open access, except when it <lb/>is directly relevant to the argument (for background information consult Armbruster <lb/>2007, 2008a, 2008b and 2008d). To substantiate the claim that it would be wise to <lb/>reconsider the parameters of the publication repository infrastructure, we proceed as <lb/>follows. Firstly, while institutional open access mandates have brought some content <lb/>into open access, the important mandates are those of the funders and these are best <lb/>supported by a single infrastructure and large repositories, which incidentally enhances <lb/>the value of the collection (while a transfer to institutional repositories would diminish <lb/>the value). Secondly, we compare and contrast a system based on central research <lb/>publication repositories with the notion of a network of institutional repositories to <lb/>illustrate that across central dimensions of any repository solution the institutional <lb/>model is more cumbersome and less likely to achieve a high level of service. Next, three <lb/>key functions of publication repositories are reconsidered, namely a) the fast and wide <lb/>dissemination of results; b) the preservation of the record; and c) digital curation for <lb/>dissemination and preservation. Fourth, repositories and their ecologies are explored <lb/>with the overriding aim of enhancing content and enhancing usage. Fifth, a target <lb/>scheme is sketched, including some examples. In closing, a look at the evolutionary <lb/>road ahead is offered. <lb/></body>

			<body> Deposit mandates: towards a single repository, common format and <lb/>integrated services? <lb/> Deposit mandates are seen as the most important route to enabling more open access to <lb/>scientific knowledge. Funders&apos; deposit mandates seem particularly important because <lb/>they target high quality research output, thus setting an example for scientific <lb/>communities as well as academic institutions. When the National Institute of Health <lb/>(NIH) implemented its public access policy in 2008, deposit in Pub Med Central (PMC) <lb/>was mandated, a digital archive developed and supported by the NIH as a single <lb/>repository with a common format. 2 Earlier, in 2006, several UK research funders in the <lb/>life sciences had also opted to create a single repository with a common format, UK <lb/>PMC (linked to PMC), to implement their deposit mandates. 3 <lb/> While it could be argued that subject-oriented funders would favour subject-based <lb/>repositories, it is nevertheless remarkable that they would opt for a single, shared <lb/>repository. Moreover, the European Research Council (ERC) and the European <lb/>Commission (EC, as research funder), which fund across disciplines and countries, are <lb/>also opting to create a single repository. Initially, the European Commission had <lb/>favoured institutional repositories, later advocating deposit in institutional and subject-<lb/>based repositories alike. However, once deposit mandates were being implemented, it <lb/>became apparent that a high-quality repository service is required, which is achieved <lb/>most likely by a single repository with a common format. 4 <lb/> Single repositories are providing distinct value to funders, such as helping them to <lb/>manage their relations with grantees (e.g. reporting), improving internal knowledge <lb/>management (e.g. portfolio management) and providing the public with a <lb/>comprehensive overview of research results achieved (e.g. accountability). Moreover, <lb/>the common format helps the repository manager to develop services that are of value to <lb/>grantees (authors) and users alike, such as citation services tracking the impact of a <lb/>publication dynamically. Moreover, single repositories, which typically are large and <lb/>shared, are accomplishing a growing volume of direct publisher deposit. <lb/>A difference must be observed between posting a working paper or preprint and <lb/>depositing a final published result. Authors will post a preprint to claim priority and <lb/>inform colleagues, but for the deposit of a final published result the author is neither the <lb/>most interested nor the right agent, as professional intervention by publishers and <lb/>librarians is required. Experience with large-scale deposit by publishers and deposit <lb/>assisted by librarians imparts two lessons. Firstly, the notion that a deposit mandate <lb/>would nudge authors to do a few more keystrokes to self-archive a final version is <lb/>principally mistaken. Providing open access to final published results, whether the <lb/>author&apos;s final manuscript or the publisher&apos;s version, requires quality checks (version <lb/>control, metadata) and long-term solutions (archiving, access) that mean that librarians <lb/>

			and publishers are much better placed to handle the deposit. If this is so, then a second <lb/>lesson follows, namely that a large-scale solution is the economically more efficient <lb/>way of organising the deposit of final research results. <lb/>By contrast, there exist well over one thousand institutional repositories, the majority of <lb/>which hold very little content. Further still, these repositories have no common format. <lb/>The one integrated service operational for many years, a protocol for metadata <lb/>harvesting, does not guarantee the most basic service that repositories must offer: search <lb/>and find. A critical experiment for high-quality self-archived articles has clear results <lb/>(Bergstrom, Lavaty 2007). First, it was established that for thirty-three key economic <lb/>journals (of a given year), ninety percent of articles in the most-cited journals had been <lb/>self-archived and about fifty percent of articles in less-cited journals were available. <lb/>Second, all freely available articles could be found using the Google search engine. <lb/>However, when using OAIster to search (institutional) repositories (based on the Open <lb/>Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), only one quarter of the articles <lb/>were found. <lb/>Institutional repositories initially may have seemed like a good way to enhance the <lb/>visibility of research results produced at any institution. Also, they seemingly reflect the <lb/>grassroots nature of the open access movement and the initiative of individuals, <lb/>departments and libraries. Yet, a glance at a ranking of repositories for visibility, quality <lb/>and available items reveals a rather short head of fairly large repositories based on <lb/>research publications (high-quality preprints included). 5 The standard argument of <lb/>proponents of the institutional solution is that deposit mandates will help to fill (and <lb/>institutional repositories backed by a mandate do reasonably well in the ranking), but <lb/>this still leaves open the issues of a common format and integrated services. Moreover, <lb/>problems of coordination and cost would seem insurmountable already in the medium <lb/>term, compounded by the problem of how to guarantee permanent access. <lb/> Comparison and contrast: central research publication repositories <lb/>versus a network of institutional repositories <lb/> Central research publication repositories are very attractive for their quality. Research <lb/>funding is usually highly selective and the proposal must demonstrate originality and <lb/>novelty. Selected research proposals are adequately funded. The publishable results are <lb/>submitted to the best journals. In the process, the research design and results often are <lb/>vetted multiple times by peer review. A central research publication repository is <lb/>therefore likely to hold the best, most original and newest research. Moreover, they <lb/>allow for portfolio management. Funders and institutions easily may track results <lb/>through publications (and data sets) while users have an information tool to look up <lb/>grant holders and research results. <lb/>An institutional repository contains the various outputs of the institution. While research <lb/>results are important among these outputs, so are works of qualification or teaching and <lb/>learning materials. If the repository captures the whole output, it is both a library and a <lb/>showcase. It is a library in that it holds the collection. It is a showcase because the <lb/>

			online open access display and availability of the collection may serve to impress and <lb/>connect, for example, with alumni of the institution or the colleagues of researchers. <lb/>Moreover, such an institutional repository could have an important function in regional <lb/>development. It allows firms, public bodies and civil society organisations to <lb/>immediately understand what kind of expertise is locally available. Institutional <lb/>repositories may also support internal and external assessment as well as strategic <lb/>planning. <lb/>A more systematic comparison may be undertaken across key dimensions. Taking into <lb/>account, roughly, what is known about institutional repositories on the one hand and <lb/>central research publication repositories (e.g. Arxiv, SSRN, HAL, RePEc etc.) on the <lb/>other hand, the following picture emerges. <lb/> Central repository <lb/>Institutional repository <lb/> Deposit <lb/> Submission system that seeks to <lb/>maximize publisher deposit and <lb/>assisted <lb/>deposit, <lb/>backed <lb/>by <lb/>publishers and librarians. <lb/>Self-archiving, requiring the author(s) <lb/>to submit (including metadata), <lb/>possibly assisted by repository staff. <lb/> Quality <lb/> Final publication primarily, peer <lb/>reviewed, with quality imprimatur, <lb/>possibly <lb/>with <lb/>supplementary <lb/>material such as data – often based <lb/>on results of funded research, with <lb/>earlier peer review of proposals. <lb/>Wealth of material, much qualification <lb/>work, final publications only part of <lb/>the collection. <lb/> Visibility <lb/> Coherent collection, alert services to <lb/>the research community.

			Two observations would seem to follow. Firstly, a central solution has some distinct <lb/>advantages. The most important is that any central repository is part of the natural <lb/>environment of the scientist in a way that the institutional repository will never be. A <lb/>connected additional advantage is that unified and high standards support the <lb/>continuous improvement of services. All this may be achieved while reducing the <lb/>burden for the author. It would also seem that maintenance and preservation may be <lb/>managed more efficiently with a single repository, making this the more easily <lb/>sustainable solution. Secondly, it emerges that institutional repositories and their <lb/>networking is a counter-intuitive solution. Going against the grain sometimes is <lb/>successful and the proponents of institutional repositories did believe that this was the <lb/>best way too proceed from spontaneous self-archiving (estimated to be limited to about <lb/>15% of research results) to universal open access. However, if one compares the content <lb/>available, the level of service and the potential of the two alternative models, then it <lb/>emerges that institutional repositories have a future that is strictly limited to cases in <lb/>which institutions have the resources and consider it a priority to host an institutional <lb/>showcase. <lb/> Publication repositories – the big picture <lb/> After arguing that central publication repositories perform better across key dimensions, <lb/>we move to consider important functions that repositories have for both researchers and <lb/>research institutions. 6 As depicted in Figure 1, repositories need to be able to fulfil the <lb/>following functions: <lb/> • Provide an infrastructure whereby scientific information is widely disseminated <lb/>and accessible to researchers and the public alike; <lb/> • Establish a reliable environment that certifies information with regard to the <lb/>depositor, the reliability of the information being deposited and the time at <lb/>which the information has been deposited; <lb/> • Guaranty long-term availability, meaning that repositories are also libraries. <lb/> Figure 1: The big picture <lb/>

			Fast and wide dissemination of scientific information <lb/> The first and foremost reason why a researcher may be interested in having a <lb/>publication repository at hand is because it allows her or him to do more efficiently <lb/>what the job is all about, namely communicating ideas and results. As soon as electronic <lb/>communication became available, researchers have widely used email, ftp sites and, <lb/>ultimately, web pages to disseminate their publications or drafts thereof. What they <lb/>basically expect from such environments is the capacity to have their work reach actual <lb/>or potential colleagues immediately. <lb/>In fact, researchers are reluctant to invest more than what is strictly necessary in these <lb/>dissemination activities. We cannot expect for instance to have them accurately key in <lb/>precise metadata such as the exact journal title, publisher, pagination, and the like. <lb/>Besides, the document that is posted or transmitted is the one at hand and only very <lb/>seldom will efforts be made in identifying which format would ensure the greatest <lb/>legibility of the work. <lb/>Researchers&apos; interest has led to the development of central repositories, mostly <lb/>articulated around the dissemination of pre-prints, whose function is to act as a direct <lb/>gateway between researchers and their colleagues. This view of repositories as direct <lb/>scientific communication tool has been the source of development of specific researcher <lb/>oriented services such as prior scientific validation, alerts, thematic organisation of <lb/>content, together with minimalistic metadata profiles, allowing further harvesting by <lb/>portals. Paradigmatic examples of such a repository framework are Arxiv, RePEc or <lb/>SSRN, which in some domains have become major content holders and service <lb/>providers. HAL, as a national infrastructure, was initially conceived as a researcher&apos;s <lb/>tool mirroring the functionalities of Arxiv. 7 <lb/> Another important aspect of the dissemination philosophy is that researchers are <lb/>naturally tempted to associate to a publication corresponding accompanying material <lb/>that has either been material for the research or which has been published in <lb/>combination with the paper. Such material may cover research notes, laboratory <lb/>notebooks, slides presented at a conference, various illustrations or graphics, software <lb/>and reports of all kinds. The potential complexity of accompanying material, from the <lb/>point of view of their storing and documentation, may bring in a supplementary order of <lb/>complexity, and potentially of fuzziness in the context of publication repositories. <lb/>It can be observed that even if researchers are at the centre of the dissemination <lb/>activities, research institutions may also be interested in having scientific results widely <lb/>disseminated. When they do so, they express further requirements, as we shall see in the <lb/>following section. <lb/> A digital memory of research results <lb/> A complementary view on publication repositories is to consider them as a preservation <lb/>area of the scientific production associated with an individual or a group. Even if mainly <lb/>

			associated with the vision that a research institution would have on publication <lb/>repositories, it should be noted that individuals also consider a publication repository a <lb/>reliable place where their publications will be preserved and where they themselves will <lb/>retrieve their various outputs over the years. Furthermore, this view relates also to the <lb/>political expectations of a society towards its research institutions, in that they are able <lb/>to preserve, as would be done for any other kind of cultural heritage asset, a trace of <lb/>their activities and discoveries. What is expected is the capacity to manage publication <lb/>material in such a way that, on the one hand, at any time in the future this material will <lb/>be retrievable and legible, and, on the other hand, this material represents an accurate <lb/>and comprehensive picture of the actual research output. <lb/>The issue of retrievability can be linked to the capacity to provide long-term archiving <lb/>access — in a broad sense — to the corresponding content. By long-term archiving we <lb/>mean here not only the capacity to store data in a reliable way at bit level, so that <lb/>basically no information loss would occur, but also the capacity to document the data in <lb/>such a way that any document is associated to enough descriptors to make it uniquely <lb/>recognisable by search or navigation means. Any simplification in the metadata <lb/>description process that would lead to a blurred identification of digital items may lead <lb/>to a repository becoming a digital cemetery where information is lost forever. <lb/>Legibility has to do with the capacity to get access to the informational content of a <lb/>document independently of the technology that has been used for its creation. This <lb/>requires either on the part of the depositor or on the part of the data curation component <lb/>of the repository itself to strive for innocuous data formats that are based, as much as <lb/>one can, on official or open standards. This may require, for instance, the allocation of <lb/>specific manpower dedicated to the transformation process from proprietary format to <lb/>actual well-defined standards. 8 <lb/> Permanent access imposes far more constraints on the way information is to be <lb/>managed within repositories and can be seen as quite an overhead for anyone wanting a <lb/>simple dissemination service. Still, providing such archival facilities on top of a simple <lb/>dissemination process with basically no extra cost for the individual user (i.e. the <lb/>scientist), leads to a coherent picture where the two views forms a solid background for <lb/>justifying that such a service has a publication repository should systematically be <lb/>provided to scientific communities. <lb/>Clarification of this second function underscores that the author is not the best or right <lb/>agent for the deposit of final published material (and its supplements). Moreover, a <lb/>multitude of institutional repositories will always be able to achieve this function only a <lb/>great overall cost, because it would have to be undertaken at every site. Of course, <lb/>individual repositories could outsource preservation and permanent access to a central <lb/>archive, but that would only confirm that central repositories are the more sustainable <lb/>solution. <lb/>

			Digital curation by research libraries <lb/> Librarians can be positioned in the big picture as crucial in supporting fast and wide <lb/>dissemination as well as permanent access. Indeed, we consider that publication <lb/>repositories are embryonic to the wider notion of a digital library, which should not be <lb/>decoupled from the current research library infrastructure, but, to the contrary, be seen <lb/>as natural target role for them. <lb/>The validation and enrichment of metadata would be one basic activity to enable <lb/>enhanced services that are both fast and lasting. We can identify some core domains of <lb/>intervention by order of importance: <lb/> • Bibliographical information: this is probably the most important domain since it <lb/>fulfils both the expectations of scientists to be quoted adequately and that of <lb/>institutions to have precise information about the actual scientific production. <lb/>Among such information is the systematic proofing of article title, author list, <lb/>journal title, imprint information (volume, issue, pagination) and core identifiers <lb/>such as ISSN and DOI; <lb/> • Identity and affiliation: this comprises the disambiguation of names and the <lb/>various levels of institutional linking that bear upon an author, such as research <lb/>team, laboratory or encompassing institution. This should reflect in particular <lb/>the complexity of multiple affiliations so that any attribution of the work can be <lb/>made with accuracy. The proper management of such information is indeed a <lb/>key issue to ensure trust on the part of research institutions; <lb/> • Keywords: these may be provided by the author, but they should be produced <lb/>preferably by librarians, or at least checked, e.g. in relation to reference <lb/>vocabularies such as the MeSH 9 or centralised databases such as Termsciences 10 <lb/> (see Khayari et al., 2006). A well-defined editorial policy in this respect <lb/>facilitates the definition of coherent views on repository content. <lb/> Publication repositories and their ecology <lb/> Before we can think any further on a better organisation of publication repositories we <lb/>suggest to take another look at repositories and their ecology, as depicted in Figure 2, <lb/>which combines roles allocated to a repository with possible factors that these roles may <lb/>depend on. We aim to show that none of those factors should be considered in isolation, <lb/>but taken together. Hence the following discussion remains at a high level and does not <lb/>delve into the large amounts of literature available. <lb/>

			Figure 2: Repositories and their ecology <lb/> The core benefits of a publication repository <lb/> The three main attractors that, when put together, explain the variety of perceptions on <lb/>publication repositories and thus the necessary degree of complexity of any appropriate <lb/>organisational structure, are detailed as follows (see right hand-side of Figure 2). <lb/> Scientific work <lb/> A publication repository should be first and foremost a tool at the service of researchers. <lb/>Their own output should be easily available to them as a personal archive and, in a <lb/>second instance, as a communication tool towards their scientific community. In a way, <lb/>they should not have to be acquainted with the open access concept to just adhere to the <lb/>idea that a publication repository can become an essential aspect of the management of <lb/>their research process. In this respect, the scientist should feel at ease to manage his own <lb/>editing workflow, starting with the first research notes until the final publication, and <lb/>encompassing additional material (illustration, data excerpts), within one single <lb/>environment corresponding to his workspace within the repository. <lb/> Assessment <lb/> One cannot escape mentioning the importance of the role of repositories as an <lb/>underlying source of information for the assessment of researchers and academic <lb/>institution. Publications can indeed be considered as the core of any assessment <lb/>campaign, both from the point of view of the actual content and their visibility (e.g. <lb/>

			<page>-11 -<lb/></page>

			citation metrics). Still, it is obviously a touchy issue and once again, the focus has to be <lb/>on the scientist, so that the repository is a facilitator for her or him to produce the <lb/>information required for assessment. Researchers should indeed select the collection of <lb/>papers they want to make visible, tune the way the corresponding information is made <lb/>accessible and exported, and have the capacity to integrate seamlessly such facilities <lb/>with other reporting tools. <lb/> Strategic planning <lb/> A complementary issue to that of assessment is for research organisations to get an <lb/>overview of their scientific impact within their various fields of activity. This aspect <lb/>relates to the necessary strategic planning that all research organisations have to <lb/>perform and depends on having a reliable and comprehensive view on where, how <lb/>much and with which visibility researchers affiliated with the institution have published. <lb/>The baseline for such an activity is usually to rely on external publication databases <lb/>such as the Web of Science, from which information may be extracted according to <lb/>factors such as research domains or institutional belonging. However, this appears to be <lb/>a hazardous path to follow for two reasons: <lb/> • The thematic coverage of such databases is uneven and, as pointed out by <lb/>bibliometric studies (cf. Butler; 2006), does not take into account the <lb/>specificities of domain where, for instance, publication occurs frequently in <lb/>conferences and workshops; <lb/> • The treatment of affiliations is by far too shallow to allow a precise selection of <lb/>the material relevant to a specific institution. Problems may range from <lb/>ambiguous names to incomplete coverage of multiple affiliations, which require <lb/>enormous additional manual work as well as caution in the interpretation of <lb/>results. <lb/>In both cases, publication repositories, through their potential capacity of providing <lb/>both a wide coverage of an organisation&apos;s production as well as enriched meta-data, <lb/>should play a central role in consolidating bibliometric data. In turn, when properly <lb/>handled, this factor may be an important additional reason for individuals and <lb/>institution to adopt a repository. <lb/> Basic services to enhance content and usage <lb/> The main priority for a repository should be to stimulate scientists&apos; interest through the <lb/>provision of core and simple services corresponding to the upper layer of Figure 2. Such <lb/>services may be based on the following list: <lb/> • Easy submission: the deposit process should be made as simple as possible <lb/>through simplified deposit forms with reduced mandatory fields, direct <lb/>connection to major subject based repositories (Arxiv, PMC) where the paper <lb/>may already have been referenced, availability of a &quot; favourite co-authors &quot; list, <lb/>and eventually automatic metadata extraction from the document; <lb/> • Stable reference: the scientist should trust the repository in its capacity to both <lb/>allow her or him to point to (persistent identifier scheme) and retrieve (persistent <lb/>archiving) publications in a durable manner. This may allow the researcher to <lb/>

			use repositories for any reference to her or his work or to inform a colleague <lb/>about it; <lb/> • Publication list: one of the main ways, beyond simple Google-based searches, <lb/>users may want to retrieve information in a publication repository is to be able to <lb/>extract a list of published material, with various types of orderings (author, <lb/>dates), organisations (document type, year of publication) or output formats <lb/>(formatted vs. structured output); <lb/> • Web pages: this is usually a by-product of the publication list service, but <lb/>requires specific attention since this will be a component of the first line <lb/>presentation and communication tool of potential users at various levels <lb/>(authors, departments, institutions). It should allow a high level of customisation <lb/>while offering ready-to-use layouts. When linked to a Content Management <lb/>System, an automated generation of web pages can be seamlessly integrated <lb/>with a laboratory web site. 11 <lb/> Editorial support <lb/> The three main areas where editorial support (through research librarians) may provide <lb/>benefits to a publication repository and its users are the identification of content, <lb/>support of deposit, and enrichment of content. <lb/>The identification of content is a pro-active endeavour to work closely with the scientist <lb/>so that they are aware of the existence of the repository and are encouraged to signal <lb/>publications ready for deposit. More generally, it means to trace publishing activity <lb/>relevant to the repository. Identified content needs to be deposited and this may be <lb/>supported in a number of ways, not only by organising (automatic) publisher deposit <lb/>and setting up an easy manuscript submission system (assisted deposit) but also by <lb/>providing service that ensure visibility and dissemination to the relevant communities <lb/>(e.g. exchange with other repositories of a stable version). More generally, thematic <lb/>collections are likely to be the focus of dissemination activities. Central repositories <lb/>(e.g. Arxiv, SSRN or RePEc) demonstrate that pro-active dissemination by notification <lb/>mechanisms is highly appreciated by researchers and turns the repository into a valuable <lb/>resource. <lb/> Beyond open access – collaboration schemes with publishers <lb/> For repositories to work across the disciplines, a strong open access policy is an <lb/>important factor for the success, visibility and use of a publication repository. Ideally, <lb/>the scientific publishing system would be switched to a non-exclusive licensing system <lb/>to enhance market competition (Armbruster 2008a). Still, one may consider such a <lb/>policy from a systemic point of view so that it relates to the functions identified in the <lb/>big picture. A variety of policies may contribute to the development of a publication <lb/>repository (Romary, 2007), including agreements with publishers to provide open <lb/>

			<page> -13 -<lb/></page>

			access to the final published version, 12 and also more standard subscription agreements. <lb/>These can be summarized as follows: <lb/> • Gold open access schemes allow publishers&apos; versions to be transferred to <lb/>repositories, and made freely accessible, also reporting usage and tracking <lb/>citations; <lb/> • When items are not open access, every effort should be made to reach an <lb/>agreement whereby publishers&apos; version are at least deposited in a &quot;dark <lb/>archive&quot;, allowing institutions to keep a complete record of their scientific <lb/>production; <lb/> • The lowest level of agreement, nevertheless essential, is to bring publishers to <lb/>provide precise metadata profiles for all publications relevant to the research <lb/>institution. This allows publication repository to consolidate precise <lb/>documentation related to the paper, and conversely gives publishers the <lb/>assurance that, for instance, backward links to their online services (through <lb/>DOIs) are systematically indicated. <lb/> Providing useful and reliable secondary data <lb/> The experience gained from existing central repositories has shown that they are likely <lb/>to be the most accurate place where reliable metadata, in particular in the domain of <lb/>authors&apos; affiliation, may be kept. As a matter of fact, when the author sees the <lb/>repository as a research tool and enough editorial backing is provided, she or he is <lb/>naturally tempted to detect inconsistencies, e.g. in affiliation. If this issue is taken <lb/>seriously enough when deploying a publication repository, we can expect that the <lb/>quality level of the corresponding metadata shall reach higher standards than those <lb/>observed in third party databases such as the Web of Science, Scopus, or Google <lb/>Scholar, which usually take the paper version of the articles as their primary <lb/>information source (Armbruster 2008c). <lb/>A more prospective aspect on which publication repositories may provide specific <lb/>information relation to scholarly publishing is that of access and usage. Indeed, the <lb/>accessibility of content may be subjected to evaluation (e.g. the Webometrics ranking of <lb/>repositories) and repositories can gather and consolidate usage information concerning <lb/>hits and downloads to their content, whether this is metadata or full-text access. Such <lb/>information is useful to the scientist, as it allows her or him to see how much various <lb/>publications are searched for. It is also a source of potential indicators about the <lb/>dissemination role of the repository and, furthermore, a potential contribution to the <lb/>assessment of scientific content. Even if there exists quite enormous activity in defining <lb/>possible counting schemes for repository access (see for instance Brody et al., 2009), <lb/>the reliability of the corresponding information is essentially organisational. The first <lb/>factor is that of the global visibility of the repository proper whereby it is actually <lb/>indexed and linked by other information sources (e.g. Google scholar or Scientific <lb/>Commons). Second, it is essential, for published material to be able to consolidate <lb/>

			<note place="footnote"> 12 See Poynder (2009) for a wider discussion of various open access schemes. One of the authors of the <lb/>present paper has designed the open access publishing and transfer scheme that was agreed between the <lb/>Max Planck Society and Springer. <lb/></note>

			access information with that of publishers. This is beneficial to both sides, since it <lb/>provides research institution with a real evaluation of the interest raised by each <lb/>publication, and it is an opportunity for publishers to monitor the usage of repositories, <lb/>and increase their trust in them, and demonstrate the value of publishing services. 13 <lb/> Further services <lb/> As can be anticipated, as soon as high quality data is freely available on-line and <lb/>actually covers a great deal of the existing research production, there is room for <lb/>developing additional services related to the management of content (bibliographical <lb/>links, document indexing and classification) or its further exploitation (overlay <lb/>services). <lb/>One important direction to follow, for which a publication repository may be well <lb/>suited, is to use such an infrastructure as the basis for developing overlay journals, that <lb/>is peer-reviewed certification processes that use the repository as the locus of deposit of <lb/>authors&apos; manuscripts. Independently of who is carrying out the certification process -<lb/>this could be a commercial publisher -such a framework ensures that all versions of the <lb/>corresponding papers are managed and archived at one single and reliable source. <lb/> Target scheme <lb/> Following the above reflections, and supported by the experience gained in working <lb/>with various platforms as well as various institutional environments, an evolutionary <lb/>and global deployment scheme for publication repositories may be outlined. This would <lb/>lead to a consolidation of repositories to enhance services for researchers while being <lb/>more efficient for permanent access. Researchers, funders and policy makers are likely <lb/>to welcome this consolidation, but it may be expected that institutions and repository <lb/>managers that have invested into a local solution have developed an interest to maintain <lb/>their showcase. This is not a problem at all as long as interoperability is given and the <lb/>content may simultaneously be held in a central repository too. Step by step, the <lb/>situation will improve. <lb/>As outlined, we advocate an organisation of publication repositories based upon critical <lb/>mass that is geographical, thematic and based on significant deposit mandates from <lb/>large research funders and institutions. The basic advantages of a coordinated (and <lb/>sufficiently centralised) approach are the following: <lb/> • The environment is well known by the scientists from corresponding scientific <lb/>communities, whether they are personally supportive of the infrastructure or not. <lb/>This maximizes chances that the repositories will become part of the natural <lb/>ecology of researchers. <lb/> • Most of the technical services (user IDs, authority lists, workspace facilities, link <lb/>to existing research databases) can quickly have high operational quality and <lb/>follow technological evolution, since development is undertaken by an identified <lb/>team of developers; <lb/>

			<note place="footnote"> 13 The PEER Project has become an arena for cooperation between publishers and repositories, including <lb/>fresh research on usage, author and user behaviour and the economics of deposit -<lb/>http://www.peerproject.eu/ <lb/></note>

			<page> -15 -<lb/></page>

			• It brings together research institutions close enough to develop a coherent <lb/>overall strategy for publication repositories rather then loose time and money in <lb/>maintaining and networking local environments. <lb/>The close coordination of a small number of platforms may deliver a unified and <lb/>superior level of service by acting at four levels: <lb/> • Designing a common portal or, at least, standardized entry points offering the <lb/>same external visibility; <lb/> • Making sure that each platform offers a high level of technical service within a <lb/>standardised service-oriented architecture, and is quickly able to adopt emerging <lb/>technologies; <lb/> • Ensuring data interoperability and reuse; <lb/> • Having a joint long-term archiving strategy ensuring reliable maintenance of the <lb/>content. <lb/> Decentralised editorial support <lb/> While we advocate a coordinated repository infrastructure based on large repositories, it <lb/>would be sensible for the management of data to be positioned as closely as possible to <lb/>where the research is carried out. By editorial support we mean a whole range of <lb/>personal services that provide support to researchers, teams and laboratories, in order to <lb/>ensure a wide aggregation of content as well as its enrichment. This basically comprises <lb/>the various aspects that we identified in the previous sections in relation to digital <lb/>curation, but we would insist on both the importance of localised services to achieve <lb/>this and the necessary evolution in the competence profile. <lb/>Organisation of editorial support staff is very close to what research library structures <lb/>have been to date, namely organised around thematic units that are able to keep track of <lb/>researchers&apos; interests. This facilitates the management of affiliation (knowing the <lb/>researchers and their collaboration environments), the tracking of content (publication <lb/>habits) the provision of support to go towards a wider curation of research outputs <lb/>(knowledge of research methods). <lb/>This should be accompanied by some evolution in the information and library science <lb/>curricula so that the good background in information management is complemented <lb/>with enough knowledge of digital information methods and technologies. We can <lb/>anticipate that the term &quot; librarian, &quot; in the research environment may soon or later be <lb/>replaced by that of &quot; digital curator. &quot; <lb/> On scope <lb/> Deposit mandates for research results centre on final publications and data. Indeed, if <lb/>the scientific record is to become available through repositories, then this is essential. <lb/>Nevertheless, the value of the repositories should be enhanced by being flexible along <lb/>several possible axes: <lb/> • Drafts vs. published material: to cover both the dissemination and the digital <lb/>memory views that we identified earlier, repositories should be able to cover <lb/>documents at an early stage of writing as well as fully published papers. This <lb/>also corresponds to a variable level of requirement upon metadata quality, which <lb/>

			<page>-16 -<lb/></page>

			is all in all acceptable, as long as it is possible to extract published material (e.g. <lb/>for reporting purposes); <lb/> • Supplementary materials: it may also be necessary to be flexible as to the kind <lb/>of item one wants to register. If a researcher&apos;s scientific production is to be <lb/>captured, laboratory notes, case studies, software, workshop papers, tutorials and <lb/>so on should be recorded if desired; <lb/> • Alternative forms of scholarly expression: The exhibition of an urban planner or <lb/>the simulation of a climate scientist often constitutes not just a supplementary <lb/>but alternative form of expression, which repositories should account for; <lb/> • Overlay services: A variety of services that serve the authors and the users (e.g. <lb/>access, usage and citation metrics) as well as functions that support web-based <lb/>scholarly communication (e.g. comments, sharing); <lb/> • Bibliographical records: one of the central questions for any repository is <lb/>whether they should allow depositors to record publications without associating <lb/>the corresponding full-text. We support the idea that bibliographical records are <lb/>indeed part of the publication continuum and should be incorporated within the <lb/>scope of a repository. In many respects, bringing (or mandating) research <lb/>communities to recording their published production naturally leads them to <lb/>consider the advantages of also depositing full-texts. <lb/>Good management of metadata always allows one to specifically focus on a sub-<lb/>collection of documents, thus making it quite unnecessary to filter out content at the <lb/>source of deposit. All in all, publication repositories, seen at the coordinated level we <lb/>advocate here, are a core component of scientific information. <lb/> Towards a more accurate standardisation plan <lb/> A more coordinated model enhances the definition of data representation and <lb/>interoperability standards than any perspective limiting itself to surface harvesting of <lb/>local publication repositories. The underlying objective is to reach a level of <lb/>interoperability standards that allows the exchange of the full content of a repository. <lb/>From a metadata point of view, the aim is to define representations that form a <lb/>continuum between the information that document a single paper and that which is used <lb/>to cite papers. By doing so, we pave the way for a full networking of publication data <lb/>which in turn can be reused by scientist themselves either to simply get accurate <lb/>reference lists or to trace citation links between scientific papers. <lb/>In the same way, a coherent scheme should be thought of for the representation of full <lb/>texts, with the perspective to form a continuum at all stages of the publication workflow <lb/>(cf. Holmes and Romary, 2009), from the writing of a scholarly paper, its dissemination <lb/>in various formats, and finally its long-term archival in a repository. Such a <lb/>standardisation activity requires a deep vision about what facilities corresponding <lb/>formats should offer, as well as a high coordination with repository managers. <lb/>Further effort is required for the definition of a whole portfolio of statistical measures <lb/>that would provide an in-depth picture of access rates to repository context, ranging <lb/>from basic metadata access to precise tracing of full-text (or contextual) searches. <lb/>

			<page>-17 -<lb/></page>

			Sustainability <lb/> Over the long term, the most important reasons why we need a more concentrated <lb/>infrastructure for publication repositories is that of sustainability. The current picture <lb/>has lead academic institutions to dedicate some small man-power to the initiation of <lb/>local repositories, without actually integrating this into a master plan to further maintain <lb/>and improve it. Even more, making a local publication repository a success is, when you <lb/>actually ask the persons in charge &quot; a considerable effort, &quot; that not all universities or <lb/>academic institution may afford. <lb/>By focusing on more centralised technical infrastructures, it is possible to think of <lb/>business models whereby institutions actually contribute with a small share to an <lb/>environment which is more likely to be sustainable and, as we already mentioned, bring <lb/>better services continuously. In turn, this allows academic organisations to put more <lb/>emphasis on the actual editorial support and local dissemination activities, to ensure that <lb/>their own production is accurately deposited and preserved in the repository. <lb/> Two related examples <lb/> To illustrate how the target scheme may be implemented, we provide two major <lb/>examples of such a coordinated approach. These two repository infrastructures actually <lb/>encompass many of the technical facilities and user oriented services that we outlined in <lb/>this paper and can be viewed from two complementary angles: <lb/> • From a user&apos;s point of view, as the basis for a wider service covering a large <lb/>community (federation of research institutions, universities); <lb/> • From an organisational point of view, as core participants to a reduced cluster of <lb/>platforms that could offer an efficient and sustainable research infrastructure for <lb/>publications. <lb/> HAL – a national infrastructure <lb/> HAL was initially created in 2001 to offer a trustworthy counterpart to Arxiv that could <lb/>be extended to offer services to the French scientific communities, from both a multi-<lb/>disciplinary and multi-institutional perspective. It currently contains 120,000 full text <lb/>documents (among which are 13,000 PhD theses) and has been recognised since 2006 <lb/>as the reference archive for all major French academic organisations. <lb/>The HAL platform is accessed by means of several portals, which allow specific <lb/>communities (e.g. Human and Social Sciences, information and communication <lb/>technologies) or institutions (e.g. HAL-INSERM, HAL INRIA, partner universities) to <lb/>use the system. It also identifies collections for tutorials and PhD thesis. HAL is a full <lb/>mirror for Arxiv. It also enables conferences to publish their papers online in a <lb/>dedicated collection. <lb/>In its current operational configuration, HAL offers a wide range of functionality: <lb/> • Depositor workspace for the management of primary deposit, content <lb/>enrichment (metadata, complementary documents) and versioning; <lb/> • Author and institutional descriptions; <lb/>

			<page>-18 -<lb/></page>

			• Basic access statistics (bibliographical entry, full text) for authors; <lb/> • Automatic generation of author&apos;s collection (e.g. to provide author&apos;s web page) <lb/> • Multiple export formats (bibtex, endnote, TEI, connection to Crossref) <lb/> • Linkage with major subject based repositories (Arxiv, Repec, PMC) <lb/> • Simple and complex search (metadata, full text) <lb/>Institutions who want to benefit from HAL services may express various kinds of <lb/>requirements ranging from the simplest usage of HAL to the definition of specific <lb/>environments. At the simplest level, they may use the generic HAL environment and <lb/>take part in the quality control associated with each deposit. If need be, they can have a <lb/>specific layout designed for the presentation of their research output. In specific cases, <lb/>they may also have their own portal with customized metadata profiles or submission <lb/>interface. This has been the case for INRIA, 14 which, after five years of operation, <lb/>covers 32% of INRIA&apos;s scientific production across its eight research centres. Editorial <lb/>support (data validation and enrichment) as well as communication with researchers, is <lb/>provided by the scientific information networks of the various research centres. <lb/> eSciDoc — an open technological platform <lb/> eSciDoc is a joint project between the Max Planck Society (MPS) and FIZ Karlsruhe, <lb/>sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Within the <lb/>MPS, the project falls under the auspices of the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL), <lb/>founded in January 2007. The goal of the project is to develop a multidisciplinary, <lb/>virtual research environment as a part of the government&apos;s eScience initiative. The <lb/>infrastructure and the applications based upon it are made available through an open <lb/>source license. 15 <lb/> eSciDoc is a repository infrastructure platform for management of research publications <lb/>and data. It is based on Fedora and offers additional services and application solutions <lb/>to manage various types of scientific information at large, including a publication <lb/>repository, PubMan. 16 The PubMan solution is being rolled out at the Max Planck <lb/>Society, starting from May 2009, having already been tested and adopted by six <lb/>institutes (of the more than seventy). It is intended to replace the former eDoc <lb/>repository, which was based on a proprietary software platform and appeared to be <lb/>neither maintainable nor extensible in the mid-term. The current eDoc repository system <lb/>within the Max Planck Society holds more than 100.000 references and about 30.000 <lb/>full texts and will be migrated to the new PubMan system. <lb/>Being based on a service-oriented architecture, eSciDoc offers the possibility to deploy <lb/>additional services within the same technical environment, and to compose services <lb/>external to eSciDoc as part of a standard service offer. Such services can either be <lb/>

			specific extensions for special collections, 17 external institutions, 18 or to design <lb/>scientific data repositories 19 articulated in conjunction with publications. <lb/>As a whole eSciDoc combines the strength of a centrally maintained technical platform, <lb/>with the capacity to enhance functionality uniformly for all types of users and local <lb/>management of data since, the research library of the Max Planck Institutes are <lb/>responsible for the quality control process of the corresponding content. <lb/> Perspective: Revolution or evolution? <lb/> Presently, the fragmented landscape of institutional repositories predominates, but their <lb/>repositories are overwhelmingly empty. By contrast, some central publication <lb/>repositories, not just those supported by funders&apos; mandates but also those built up to <lb/>serve researchers, have become valuable resources. We therefore contemplate possible <lb/>transition scenarios, which may help the academic community to go in the direction of <lb/>more functional repositories with a high value to active researchers. <lb/>The first step is to create a community of practice, whereby academic institutions start <lb/>sharing platforms and deployment strategies. This is not to advocate the deployment of <lb/>any particular off-the-shelf software, but to suggest that a shared open source project <lb/>should be established. <lb/>The second step is to start sharing developments across technical teams involved in <lb/>deploying publication repository solutions. This involves two main aspects. First, it <lb/>minimizes duplication of work by allowing the various partners to focus on specific <lb/>functionalities and assemble the expertise required to exploit them. Second, it forces the <lb/>technical team to go deeper into standardizing both their development practices and the <lb/>actual formats and interfaces they are using. By doing so, one may expect to have an <lb/>increasing number of generic components at hand. <lb/>The third step is more organisational; it has to do with sharing editorial practices <lb/>between institutions. This ranges from the definition of basic guidelines and priorities <lb/>that curation should handle uniformly, to the management of joint authority services for <lb/>institutions, authors, publication places (journals and conferences) and terminology. <lb/>While sharing practices extensively, this step is also an opportunity to think about <lb/>specific thematic, sub-institutional or geographic organisation schemes optimizing the <lb/>editorial support needed for the various communities. <lb/>The fourth step builds upon the preceding ones as it corresponds to moving to fully <lb/>shared deployment platforms across institutions. This is how the target scheme may be <lb/>achieved, based on coordinated technical work to enhance services at a quick pace and <lb/>uniformly for all users, as well as a high-level editorial support ensuring the same level <lb/>

			<note place="footnote">17 For instance, the whole scientific output of a scientist together with some illustrating information. From <lb/>http://sengbusch.blogs.mpdl.mpg.de/, all publication material are actually referenced from eSciDoc. <lb/></note> 
			
			<note place="footnote">18 The National Institute for Material Sciences (NIMS, JP) has adopted eSciDoc as its publication <lb/>repository platform, with the specific aim in mind to offer dedicated researchers&apos; webpages (see <lb/>http://todoroki.blogs.mpdl.mpg.de/). <lb/></note> 
			
			<note place="footnote">19 E.g. http://colab.mpdl.mpg.de/mediawiki/Faces <lb/></note>

			of quality requirements for the actual content. This is also the stage at which institutions <lb/>can actually coordinate their open access policy and contemplate further usages for the <lb/>publication material as available in the repository. <lb/>The specific vision that we have advocated in this paper goes into the direction of <lb/>providing scientists with digital scholarly workbenches which, through a better <lb/>coordination of technical infrastructures and adapted editorial support will provide both <lb/>the quality and flexibility that is required for efficient scientific work. Even if we have <lb/>focused here on the issue of publication repositories, which, for many reasons, lie <lb/>currently at the centre of most debates, it is important to consider that this perspective is <lb/>just one element within a larger set of digital scholarly services that have to be managed <lb/>in a coordinated way. <lb/>Two main directions may be identified. On the one hand, access to subscribed material <lb/>(online journals, but also eBooks and databases) should not be decoupled from a more <lb/>integrated repository landscape. Whatever information source is accessed, this should <lb/>be as seamless as possible for the end-user and all technical decisions (unique <lb/>identifiers, metadata formats, representation of full-text) should be taken to facilitate <lb/>this. <lb/>On the other hand, attention should be given to the deployment of research data <lb/>repositories, a complex issue given the variety of type and size of research data, and <lb/>their integration with publication repositories. A concerted approach could articulate <lb/>solutions for specific research domains and communities. Existing publication <lb/>infrastructures may play a stabilizing role by providing coherent concepts that could be <lb/>seen as global to all scholarly architectures (e.g. attribution and affiliation schemes). <lb/>Finally, we should think of coordinating several core services that will increase the <lb/>effectiveness of scientific digital infrastructures as a whole. Such services may range <lb/>from cumulative multilingual terminologies to research organisation directories and <lb/>open unique document identifier schemes. We cannot expect all these to be stable <lb/>services immediately, but the direction we have tried to follow in this paper aims at <lb/>showing how a better coordination of scientific infrastructures may allow us to achieve <lb/>this. <lb/>
