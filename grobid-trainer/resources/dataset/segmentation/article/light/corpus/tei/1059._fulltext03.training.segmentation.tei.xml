The adduct C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 has been crystallized <lb/>from toluene solutions of C 60 and (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 as violet, trigonal <lb/>plate-shaped crystals. The compound was studied by single-crystal <lb/>x-ray diffraction (P31c, a ϭ 1278.17(3), c ϭ 2282.92(6) pm). The <lb/>gold complex is dissociated into [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cations, which <lb/>encapsulate the neutral C 60 molecules, and nitrate anions.

			<body>Since the discovery of fullerenes [1] and their interesting electronic <lb/>and magnetic properties [2, 3], there has also been a considerable <lb/>interest in their supramolecular chemistry. Due to their electron <lb/>accepting properties, fullerenes interact and form co-crystals with <lb/>electron donor molecules that can adapt to the spherical shape of <lb/>the fullerenes. Examples include porphyrins, calixarenes and <lb/>molecules with aromatic donors [4Ϫ8]. The crystal chemistry of <lb/>C 60 and its co-crystals has been recently reviewed [9, 10]. <lb/> The adaption to the spherical shape of the C 60 molecules may be <lb/>either realized by molecules with concave surfaces or the organiz-<lb/>ation of small donors into networks of concave shape. Depending <lb/>on the flexibility of the molecules or the networks, respectively, a <lb/>structure with optimal donor-acceptor interaction is possible. For <lb/>example phenol as a co-crystallizing agent is able to form highly <lb/>flexible supramolecular arrangements, which can encapsulate <lb/>fullerene molecules to form well-ordered compounds [11, 12]. In <lb/>this work, the synthesis and crystal structure of the adduct of neu-<lb/>tral C 60 with an ionic compound, the gold complex (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 <lb/>(tol: tolyl, -C 6 H 4 CH 3 ), is described and analyzed with respect to <lb/>the encapsulation and ordering of the fullerene molecules. <lb/>Results and Discussion <lb/>C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 precipitates from a solution of C 60 and <lb/>(Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 in toluene as violet, trigonal plate-shaped crystals. <lb/>The compound, once formed, is insoluble in toluene, which <lb/>accounts for a relatively high stability of the adduct. Growing <lb/>C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 from a rather diluted solution leads to larger <lb/></body>

			<body>and less intergrown crystals. The crystal structure was determined <lb/>by single crystal x-ray diffraction. <lb/>C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 crystallizes with trigonal symmetry and two <lb/>formula units in the unit cell. The gold complex is dissociated into <lb/>the linear [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cation and the nitrate anion. In the crystal <lb/>structure, the cations are forming strands along [001] with the <lb/>supramolecular motif of sixfold phenyl embraces [13], i.e. six <lb/>C-H/π interactions between the tolyl-rings (see figure 1b). These <lb/>strands are in a hexagonal arrangement, as depicted in figure 1c. <lb/>In every hexagonal layer of the [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cations, there are two <lb/>different kinds of voids. The small voids are occupied by the nitrate <lb/>ions and the large voids are occupied by the fullerene molecules. <lb/>In consecutive layers, the position of the small and large voids in-<lb/>terchange, as the [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cations in are rotated by 60°. The <lb/>nitrate anions are disordered over several orientations, which could <lb/>not be resolved unambiguously. <lb/>The center of the C 60 molecule resides on the special position (2c, <lb/>2/3, 1/3, 3/4) with site symmetry 3.2. The molecule was found to <lb/>be disordered over two orientations, which are related by the crys-<lb/>tallographic twofold axes (figure 1a). All split positions could be <lb/>refined individually. It is interesting to ask why the C 60 molecule is <lb/>disordered, because the site symmetry of the void (3.2), which is <lb/>formed by the [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cations, is a subgroup of the icosahed-<lb/>ral symmetry of C 60 . Thus, the C 60 molecule could in principle <lb/>be ordered in the crystal structure, but this unique orientation is <lb/>obviously not energetically favored. In order to further investigate <lb/>this phenomenon, an ordered model was constructed by rotating <lb/>the C 60 molecule until the crystallographic and the molecular two-<lb/>fold axes match and then the interaction with the surrounding tolyl <lb/>rings in the disordered and ordered model was examined. In the <lb/>resulting orientation, each fullerene is interacting with six tolyl <lb/>rings via π-π interactions and six additional tolyl rings via C-H/π <lb/>interactions. All of the six respective interactions are crystallo-<lb/>graphically equivalent, c.f. figure 2. In the disordered model, as <lb/>found experimentally, the hydrogen atom involved in the C-H/π <lb/>interaction points towards the center a hexagon and the border of <lb/>hexagon, respectively. In other words, every C 60 molecule is coordi-<lb/>nated by three hydrogen atoms pointing towards the center and <lb/></body>

			<body>three hydrogen atoms pointing towards the border of a hexagon. <lb/>In the constructed, ordered model all hydrogen atoms are pointing <lb/>towards a 5:6 ring junction. The C-H/π interaction with the hexa-<lb/>gons is more favorable than with the pentagons, as the electron <lb/>density in the pentagons is lower [14]. Therefore, the overall C-H/ <lb/>π interactions seem to be more efficient with the C 60 molecule in <lb/>the position of the disordered model compared to the ordered one. <lb/>The same conclusions can be drawn by looking at the π-π interac-<lb/>tions (figure 2c and d). According to the Hunter-Sanders rules [15], <lb/>the most favorable interaction should be between the π-electrons <lb/>of the tolyl-rings and the electron-poor 5:6 bonds of C 60 . In the <lb/>hypothetical ordered model, the tolyl-rings cover two 5:6 bonds <lb/>and two 6:6 bonds. In the disordered model, half of the tolyl-rings <lb/>cover two 5:6 bonds and two 6:6 bonds as well. The other half <lb/>covers four 5:6 bonds, so that this orientation of the C 60 molecule <lb/>should be slightly favored. <lb/>Figure 1 a) The two orientations of C 60 are depicted in green and <lb/>red. The view is along [1Ϫ10], which is parallel to the crystallo-<lb/>graphic twofold axis that is marked by the blue circle and relates <lb/>the two orientations. b) Visualization of the strands along [001] of <lb/>the [(Ptol 3 ) 2 Au] ϩ cations. c) Projection of the crystal structure <lb/>along [001]. Purple: P, blue: N, red: O. <lb/>By the inspection of both, the C-H/π and the π-π interactions, it is <lb/>plausible that the orientation of the C 60 molecule of the disordered <lb/>model is preferred over the orientation in the ordered model. The <lb/>occurrence of the disorder is inevitable as there are two crystallo-<lb/>graphically equivalent orientations. The crystal structure of <lb/>C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 is an instructive example, demonstrating that <lb/>symmetry-matching is not always sufficient for avoiding disorder. <lb/>Figure 3 shows a comparison between the experimental and calcu-<lb/>lated powder x-ray diffractograms of C 60 • (Ptol 3 ) 2 AuNO 3 , which <lb/>approves the structural model and the purity of the synthesized <lb/>bulk sample. <lb/></body>

In the crystal structure, the C 60 molecule is dis-<lb/>ordered over two orientations, although the symmetry of C 60 and <lb/>its specific crystal environment would allow for adopting a unique <lb/>orientation. The reason for the disorder was found in the coordi-<lb/>nation to the surrounding tolyl-rings and the enhanced C-H/π and <lb/>π-π interactions present in the disordered model. <lb/></body>
