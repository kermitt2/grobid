			<front>Summary <lb/>Alternatively activated M2 macrophages (AAMs) play an important role in <lb/>maintenance of tissue homeostasis by scavenging dead cells and cell debris via <lb/>phagocytosis. An essential step in this process is phagosomal maturation. Using high-<lb/>resolution LC-MS/MS, we investigated how alternative activation, driven by IL-4, <lb/>modulated the phagosomal proteome to control macrophage function. One of the <lb/>most intriguing insights was the recruitment of the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signalling <lb/>complex to the phagosomes of IL-4 activated macrophages. The recruitment of this <lb/>signalling complex was mediated through K63 polyubiquitylation of the macrophage <lb/>scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1). MSR1 activation induced JNK signalling, thereby <lb/>facilitating macrophage polarization towards an M1 pro-inflammatory state, which <lb/>was abolished upon MSR1 deletion or JNK inhibition. Moreover, MSR1 K63 <lb/>polyubiquitylation correlated with the activation of JNK signalling in ovarian cancer <lb/>tissue from human patients, suggesting that it may be relevant for macrophage <lb/>phenotypic shift in vivo. Altogether, we identified that MSR1 signals through JNK in a <lb/>K63-polyubiquitylation-dependent manner and provide evidence for the receptor&apos;s <lb/>involvement in macrophage polarization. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Phagocytosis is a highly conserved process essential for host defence and <lb/>tissue remodelling. It involves the recognition of particles by a variety of cell surface <lb/>receptors, followed by cargo processing and delivery to lysosomes via phagosome-<lb/>lysosome fusion, process known as phagosome maturation. This leads to gradual <lb/>acidification of the phagosomal lumen and acquisition of digestive enzymes required <lb/>for the degradation of phagosomal cargo. Therefore, phagocytosis is not only <lb/>responsible for elimination of bacterial pathogens, but also the clearance of apoptotic <lb/>cells, cell debris and senescence cells and orchestrates the subsequent immune <lb/>response (Lemke, 2013, Lemke, 2017, Murray &amp; Wynn, 2011, Rothlin et al., 2007). <lb/>Central to this process is phagosomal maturation. If uncontrolled, the inappropriate <lb/>clearance of apoptotic bodies can give rise to autoimmune diseases, atherosclerosis <lb/>and cancer, while failure to ingest or kill pathogens can result in deadly infections <lb/>(Arandjelovic &amp; Ravichandran, 2015, Colegio et al., 2014, Johnson &amp; Newby, 2009, <lb/>Nagata et al., 2010). Therefore, it is of great importance to understand which signalling <lb/>pathways regulate phagocytosis and phagosomal maturation. <lb/>It has recently been acknowledged that the phagosome serves as a signalling <lb/>platform and interacts with innate immune signalling (Heckmann et al., 2017, Kagan, <lb/>2012, Martinez et al., 2011, Martinez et al., 2015, Stuart et al., 2007). However, <lb/>whether phagosome-associated cell signalling is independent of its role in cargo <lb/>degradation has not been well understood. Supporting this notion, recent proteomic <lb/>studies demonstrated that phagosomes are dynamic organelles that change their <lb/>composition and function in response to infection or inflammation (Boulais et al., <lb/>2010, Dill et al., 2015, Guo et al., 2015, Hartlova et al., 2018, Naujoks et al., 2016, Trost <lb/></body>

			<body>et al., 2009). While the regulation of phagosomal maturation in so-called M1 <lb/>inflammatory macrophages has been extensively studied, the mechanisms facilitating <lb/>phagosomal maturation in macrophages involved in tissue repair remains poorly <lb/>understood (Balce DR., Keizer. S.J., 2011) <lb/>Th2-derived cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) <lb/>induce a strong anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, also called alternative <lb/>activated macrophages (M2). M2 macrophages and tissue resident macrophages, <lb/>which often resemble an M2-like state, clear cell debris and dead cells through <lb/>phagocytosis. They are therefore essential for maintenance and tissue homeostasis. <lb/>M2 alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) inhibit inflammatory responses and <lb/>promote angiogenesis and tissue repair by synthetizing mediators required for <lb/>collagen deposition, which is important for wound healing (Gordon &amp; Martinez, 2010). <lb/>It has been shown that IL-4 enhanced phagosomal protein degradation (Balce et al., <lb/>2011). Whether IL-4 regulates other phagosomal functions, and through which <lb/>molecular mechanisms, remains unclear. <lb/>Here we demonstrate that the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signalling complex showed an <lb/>enhanced association with the phagosome upon IL-4 macrophage activation using an <lb/>unbiased quantitative LC-MS/MS approach. We further show that the assembly of the <lb/>signalling complex is mediated through K63 polyubiquitylation. By combining K63-<lb/>polyubiquitylation enrichment and mass spectrometry approaches, we identified <lb/>macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) as the upstream receptor that promotes <lb/>the recruitment of the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signalling complex to the phagosome. <lb/>Triggering MSR1 induces JNK activation in M2 macrophages. This MSR1/JNK signalling <lb/>pathway activation leads to a M2/M1 macrophage phenotypic switch that is abolished <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Alternative activation regulates phagosomal proteolysis and lipol ysis <lb/>To determine the impact of IL-4 on phagocytosis and phagosomal functions, we <lb/>examined the rate of phagocytosis and phagosomal maturation in IL-4 AAMs (M2) and <lb/>resting macrophages (M0). We found that M2 macrophages have enhanced uptake of <lb/>apoptotic cells, while uptake of necrotic cells was comparable to M0 resting <lb/>macrophages (Figure 1A). To determine whether the enhanced uptake was because <lb/>of the negative charge of apoptotic cells, we compared the uptake of fluorescently-<lb/>labelled carboxylated negatively charged and amino positively charged silica <lb/>microsphere in M2 and M0 macrophages. The analysis revealed an increased uptake <lb/>of negatively charged microspheres in M2 macrophages, while the engulfment of <lb/>positive charged microsphere was similar to M0 macrophages indicating a similarity <lb/>of carboxylated microspheres with apoptotic cells (Figure 1B). Next we analysed the <lb/>functional parameters of the phagosomal lumen including proteolysis, acidification <lb/>and lipolysis using real-time fluorescence assays (Podinovskaia et al., 2013, Yates et <lb/>al., 2005). Consistent with the previous reports, we observed enhanced proteolytic <lb/>activity in phagosomes of M2 macrophages (Balce et al., 2011). Furthermore, we <lb/>found that IL-4 increased phagosomal lipid degradation and facilitated phagosomal <lb/>acidification (Figure 1C-E) indicating that IL-4 activation promotes ability of <lb/>macrophages to degrade lipid-rich particles through phagosomes. <lb/>Quantitative proteomics analysis of phagosomes from IL-4 alternatively <lb/>activated macrophages <lb/></body>

			<body>To obtain further molecular details about the changes on phagosomes of M2 <lb/>macrophages, we isolated highly pure phagosomes from M2 and M0 macrophages by <lb/>floatation on a sucrose gradient using carboxylated microspheres and analysed their <lb/>proteomes by quantitative LC-MS/MS (Figure 1A, S2A) (Desjardins et al., 1994, Trost <lb/>et al., 2009). Comparative analysis led to the identification of 20,614 distinct peptides <lb/>corresponding to 1,948 unique proteins across three independent replicates at a false-<lb/>discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;1%, of which 1,766 proteins were quantified in at least two of <lb/>the three biological replicates. IL-4 activation induced strong changes to the <lb/>phagosome proteome with 121 proteins significantly up-and 62 proteins significantly <lb/>down-regulated (2-fold change, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 2B; Table S1), some of which we <lb/>validated by Western blot analysis (Figure S2B). Consistent with the above <lb/>observations, a subset of proteins involved in lipid metabolism (Lpl lipoprotein lipase, <lb/>ABHD12 lipase and phospholipase D1), acidification (v-ATPase complex) and lysosomal <lb/>enzymes including cathepsins L1 and D were highly enriched on the phagosome of M2 <lb/>macrophages (Figure 2D, Table S1). Moreover, GO-term (Figure 2E) and protein <lb/>network analysis (Figure S2C) further showed that IL-4 alternative activation also <lb/>increased phagosome abundance of scavenger receptors such as MARCO, CD36, <lb/>Colec12 and MSR1 required for clearance of dead cells while Toll-like receptors (TLRs) <lb/>involved in inflammatory response were reduced (Figure 2E, S2C). Consistent with <lb/>previous report, superoxide anion generation including the NADPH oxidase complex <lb/>proteins NCF1 (p47-phox), Cyba (p22-phox), Cybb (gp91-phox) and superoxide <lb/>dismutase SOD1 were strongly down-regulated in phagosomes from M2 macrophages <lb/>(Figure 2E, Figure S2C) (Balce et al., 2011). Interestingly, M2 macrophages also <lb/>enriched a large number of specific carbohydrate-binding proteins such as lectins, <lb/></body>

			<body>while carbohydrate hydrolases were significantly reduced. This indicates a <lb/>conservation of phagocytosed glycans, potentially for antigen presentation via MHC <lb/>class II molecules (Avci et al., 2013). Furthermore, M2 phagosomes showed higher <lb/>phosphatidylinositol-binding proteins, suggesting changes to the phagosome <lb/>membrane lipid content. Taken together, these results indicate that the phagosome <lb/>of M2 macrophages has mainly a homeostatic role with its increased ability to <lb/>hydrolyse proteins and lipids of incoming cargo. <lb/>TAK1/MKK7/JNK are recruited to the phagosome of M2 macrophages via <lb/>K63 polyubiquitylation <lb/>Interestingly, anti-inflammatory IL-4 activation also led to an increased phagosome <lb/>abundance of the pro-inflammatory MAP-kinase signalling complex around TAK1 <lb/>(Map3k7, 2.1-fold) and MKK7 (Map2k7, 3.1-fold) (Table S1, Figure S2C) indicating <lb/>cross-regulation between anti-and pro-inflammatory pathways. Given the increased <lb/>abundance of these pro-inflammatory kinases was surprising on phagosomes of IL-4-<lb/>stimulated macrophages, we next investigated how this complex was translocated to <lb/>the phagosome. Immunoblot analyses of total cell lysates and phagosomal fractions <lb/>revealed significant enrichment of TAK1 and MKK7 on phagosomes of M2 <lb/>macrophages compared to resting M0 macrophages (Figure 3A, B). Activated TAK1 <lb/>can phosphorylate two MAPK kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, both implicated in the <lb/>activation of JNK. While MKK4 can activate p38 and JNK MAPKs signalling pathways, <lb/>MKK7 selectively activates JNK (Tournier et al., 2001). Noteworthy, our mass <lb/>spectrometry data revealed that only MKK7 was enriched on phagosomes upon IL-4 <lb/>alternative activation. Consistent with our LC-MS/MS data, MKK4 was not detected on <lb/></body>

			<body>phagosomes of M2 macrophages by immunoblot analysis indicating that MKK7 alone <lb/>was important in this phagosome signalling pathway. Further immunoblot analysis <lb/>also confirmed enrichment of JNK of M2 macrophage phagosomes. <lb/>Previous data have shown that upon pro-inflammatory Interleukin-1 receptor <lb/>or Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, the TAK1/MKK7/JNK complex binds to the <lb/>TAB1/TAB2 protein complex, which in turn is recruited to K63 polyubiquitin chains <lb/>(Emmerich et al., 2013, Xia et al., 2009). We next tested whether TAB1/TAB2 are <lb/>recruited to the phagosome of M2 macrophages. Indeed, immunoblot analysis <lb/>demonstrated enrichment of TAB1/TAB2 on phagosomes of M2 macrophages <lb/>compared to M0. To further validate the recruitment of the protein complex to <lb/>phagosomes, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy and showed vesicular <lb/>distribution in the cytoplasm with enhanced recruitment of TAB1, TAB2 and MKK7 to <lb/>the M2 macrophage phagosome compared to M0 macrophages (Figure S3A-B). <lb/>As it is well-established that TAK1 binds via TAB1/2/3 to free and protein-<lb/>anchored K63-polyubiquitin chains in inflammatory innate immune responses <lb/>(Emmerich et al., 2013, Xia et al., 2009), we tested whether phagosomes from M2 <lb/>macrophages contain K63-polyubiquitylated proteins independent of inflammatory <lb/>stimuli. Immunoblot analysis of phagosome extracts probed with anti-K63 <lb/>polyubiquitin antibodies revealed that phagosomes contain a large amount of K63-<lb/>polyubiquitylated proteins compared to the total cell lysate, which was even more <lb/>increased by alternative activation (Figure 3C). To determine whether recruitment of <lb/>TAB1, TAB2, TAK1 and MKK7 to the M2 phagosome was indeed K63 <lb/>polyubiquitylation-dependent, we treated cells with NSC697923, a pharmacological <lb/>inhibitor of the K63-specific E2 conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A (Pulvino et al., <lb/></body>

			<body>2012) and probed isolated phagosomes for K63 polyubiquitylation. As shown in Figure <lb/>3D, recruitment of the protein complex was virtually abolished under these <lb/>conditions. These data indicate that IL-4 activation of macrophages promotes K63 <lb/>polyubiquitylation which recruits the TAK1/MKK7/JNK complex to the phagosome. <lb/>Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 is K63 polyubiquitylated and interacts <lb/>with TAK1/MKK7/JNK on the phagosome of M2 macrophages <lb/>To identify the K63 polyubiquitylated associated with TAK1/MKK7/JNK <lb/>complex on the phagosome of M2 macrophages, we enriched polyubiquitylated <lb/>phagosomal proteins from M2 macrophages using tandem ubiquitin-binding entities <lb/>(TUBEs) of a repeat of the Npl4 Zinc Finger (NZF) domain of TAB2 tagged with Halo <lb/>(termed here Halo-TAB2) that bind to K63 polyubiquitin chains (Figure 4A) (Emmerich <lb/>et al., 2013, Heap et al., 2017, Hjerpe et al., 2009). Quantitative mass spectrometric <lb/>analysis of these pull-downs identified 538 proteins that were reproducibly captured <lb/>by Halo-TAB2 compared to mutant Halo [T674A/F675A] TAB2 control beads (based on <lb/>a 2-fold, p&lt;0.05 cut-off) (Table S2). Moreover, we identified 62 novel direct <lb/>ubiquitylation (-GlyGly) sites on 33 different proteins. Quantitation of the data <lb/>revealed that the Gly-Gly peptide derived from K63-linked polyubiquitin was by far the <lb/>most abundant, proving that we achieved good enrichment. However, we also <lb/>identified peptides for K11, K48 , linear/M1, K29, K6, K27 and K33 (in order of <lb/>decreasing abundances) linked polyubiquitin, suggesting that there are either mixed <lb/>chains or K63-polyubiquitylated proteins might also be modified with other <lb/>polyubiquitin chains. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Guo &amp; Härtlova et al, MSR1 in alternatively activated macrophages <lb/></note>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Other identified ubiquitylated proteins included many known phagolysosomal <lb/>proteins such as the large neutral amino acid transporter SLC43A2/LAT4 (K283, K293, <lb/>K402, K557), the cholesterol transporter ABCG1 (K55), Fc-and B-cell Receptor adaptor <lb/>LAT2 (K39, K84), LYN kinase (K20) and the TLR chaperone UNC93B1 (K197, K582) <lb/>(Figure 4B, Table S3). <lb/>Interestingly, one of the most abundant Gly-Gly-modified peptides was a <lb/>peptide containing lysine 27 (K27) of macrophage scavenger receptor 1/scavenger <lb/>receptor A (MSR1/SR-A; CD204). This site is highly conserved between human and <lb/>mouse (Figure 4C). MSR1 is a multifunctional phagocytic receptor, highly expressed in <lb/>macrophages, involved in uptake of apoptotic cells and modified lipoproteins (Kelley <lb/>et al., 2014). In addition to its scavenging function, MSR1 has been implicated in the <lb/>innate immune response to bacteria (Platt &amp; Gordon, 2001). <lb/>Our MS and immunoblot data showed an increase of MSR1 on phagosomes <lb/>from M2 macrophages compared to M0 macrophages (Table S1, Figure S4A), while <lb/>both total cell and cell surface expression levels of MSR1 were unchanged between <lb/>the two conditions (Figure S4B). However, when we precipitated K63-<lb/>polyubiquitylated proteins from resting and M2 macrophages, we could see that the <lb/>polyubiquitylated forms of MSR1 were considerably more abundant in alternatively <lb/>activated macrophages (Figure 4D), suggesting that MSR1 becomes polyubiquitylated <lb/>in M2 macrophages. <lb/>To validate K63 polyubiquitylation of MSR1, we treated enriched <lb/>polyubiquitylated phagosome protein extracts from M2 macrophages with the K63-<lb/>specific deubiquitylase (DUB) AMSH-LP or the non-specific DUB USP2 (Ritorto et al., <lb/>2014) (Figure 4E). In both cases, the high molecular smear of ubiquitylated MSR1 <lb/></body>

			<body>decreased while the band representing the non-ubiquitylated form of MSR1 increased <lb/>significantly, indicating that MSR1 was predominantly K63 polyubiquitylated on <lb/>phagosomes upon uptake of carboxylated beads in M2 macrophages. <lb/>We next investigated whether K63-polyubiquitylated MSR1 might recruit the <lb/>TAB1/TAB2/TAK1/MKK7 complex to the phagosome. To test this, we pulled down <lb/>MSR1 from extracts of carboxylated bead phagosomes. We found that indeed <lb/>TAB1/TAB2/TAK1/MKK7 complex co-immunoprecipitated with MSR1 (Figure 4F). <lb/>Moreover, using a different antibody against TAK1, immunoblot analysis patterns <lb/>indicated also substantial post-translational modification -most likely <lb/>polyubiquitylation -of TAK1, which was considerably enhanced in MSR1 IPs. It has <lb/>been reported that ubiquitylation of TAK1 activated the kinase activity (Fan et al., <lb/>2010), suggesting that TAK1 and the downstream kinase MKK7 are recruited in the <lb/>active state or activation is triggered by binding to K63 polyubiquitylated MSR1. Taken <lb/>together, these data demonstrate that MSR1 becomes K63 polyubiquitylated upon <lb/>activation in IL-4-activated macrophages which recruits the TAK1/MKK7 kinase <lb/>signalling complex. <lb/>Triggering MSR1 activates JNK pathway <lb/>To further test whether the engagement of MSR1 causes the activation of the <lb/>TAK1/MKK7/JNK pathway, wild-type (WT) and MSR1 KO M2 macrophages were <lb/>stimulated with the MSR1 ligands fucoidan and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and analysed for <lb/>MSR1 K63-polyubiquitylation and activation of JNK signalling (Greaves &amp; Gordon, <lb/>2009). The analysis revealed that M2 macrophages deficient in MSR1 showed <lb/>diminished MSR1 K63-polyubiquitylation and decreased JNK phosphorylation upon <lb/></body>

			<body>fucoidan or ox-LDL stimulation (Figure 5A, 5B), indicating that MSR1 directly signals <lb/>through the JNK signalling pathway. This prompted us to test whether MSR1-signalling <lb/>through the JNK kinase complex plays a role in affecting the inflammatory state of <lb/>macrophages by characterizing gene expression and cell surface markers. Ablation of <lb/>MSR1 resulted in diminished induction of the pro-inflammatory genes Il1b and Tnfa in <lb/>response to fucoidan in M2 macrophages. Consistently, MSR1 KO M2 macrophages <lb/>exhibited reduced cell surface expression of pro-inflammatory markers CD69, CD86 <lb/>and CD54 while CD36, M2-cell surface marker, remained unperturbed upon MSR1 <lb/>ligation (Supplementary Figure S5A, B). This increase in pro-inflammatory state was <lb/>abolished by treatment with the specific JNK inhibitor JNK-IN8 (Zhang et al., 2012) <lb/>(Figure 5D, E, Supplementary Figure S5B, C). This process was dependent on specific <lb/>MSR1 ligands as stimulation with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-activating <lb/>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-γ did not show any differences between WT and <lb/>MSR1 KO macrophages (Figure S5A) suggesting the involvement of MSR1-JNK <lb/>pathway in phenotypic switch. These data show that triggering of MSR1 in <lb/>alternatively activated macrophages leads to the enhanced activation of the JNK <lb/>signalling pathway, which induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype switch in these <lb/>macrophages. <lb/>MSR1 is polyubiquitylated in human tumour associated macrophages <lb/>Next, we wanted to test if MSR1 ubiquitylation was also present in settings of human <lb/>disease. MSR1 has been implicated in tumour development and progression <lb/>(Chanmee et al., 2014, Komohara et al., 2009) and tumour-associated macrophages <lb/>(TAMs) have been shown to resemble M2 macrophage phenotype with MSR1 protein <lb/>expression (Sica et al., 2007). However, the role of MSR1 in TAMs is not fully <lb/></body>

			<body>understood. We characterised five human patient samples with different types of <lb/>cancers for the presence of MSR1. These tissue samples showed a high variability in <lb/>the number of TAMs that stained positively for MSR1 using immunohistochemistry <lb/>(Figure 6A). Consistent <lb/>with the <lb/>human proteome atlas data <lb/>(http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000038945-MSR1/cancer), <lb/>we <lb/>found <lb/>particularly high expression of MSR1 in patient ovarian cancer. Interestingly, the TAMs <lb/>of the patient with ovarian cancer also showed increased levels of ubiquitylated MSR1 <lb/>as well as enhanced phosphorylation of JNK and its substrate c-Jun (Figure 6B). This <lb/>suggests that JNK signalling downstream of poly-ubiquitylated MSR1 is present in <lb/>TAMs of human cancers and could potentially be involved in tumour promotion. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Macrophages are highly diverse and plastic immune cells that can polarise in <lb/>response to environmental cues into many different phenotypes. Because of their <lb/>important and diverse functions in regulating immune responses and metabolism, <lb/>dysregulated macrophage polarization is frequently associated with disease (Schultze <lb/>et al., 2015). Here we expand our understanding of macrophage phenotype switching <lb/>by showing on the molecular level that engagement of MSR1 in IL-4-activated <lb/>macrophages results in the activation of the JNK signalling pathway, thereby inducing <lb/>a shift from an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory phenotype. <lb/>Recent data implies that distinct pathways regulate uptake kinetics of different <lb/>particles as well as phagosome functions in macrophages and these are further <lb/>controlled by macrophage activation. It was demonstrated that both the phagocytic <lb/>receptors (Balce et al., 2016, Dill et al., 2015) and pro-inflammatory (Ghigo et al., <lb/></body>

			<body>2010, Trost et al., 2009, Yates et al., 2007) and anti-inflammatory activation (Balce et <lb/>al., 2011, Varin et al., 2010) of macrophages affects phagosome functions and these <lb/>are regulated by signalling pathways such as kinases (Hartlova et al., 2018) and E3-<lb/>ligases (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., unpublished data). <lb/>A striking finding from our study is the identification of increased <lb/>ubiquitylation on the phagosome. Ubiquitylation in the endo-lysosomal system is <lb/>generally thought to be important for lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins <lb/>(Piper et al., 2014). Our data indicates that K63-polyubiquitylation on phagosomal <lb/>proteins is also used as a scaffold for the recruitment of signalling complexes, in <lb/>particular the kinase complex TAK1/MKK7/JNK to MSR1 via specific polyubiquitylation <lb/>on a conserved lysine K27. Remarkably, we could show that only MKK7 and not MKK4 <lb/>is recruited to this signalling complex in IL-4-activated macrophages, showing a <lb/>different role for the two MAP kinase kinases in activating JNK. <lb/>It is noteworthy that MSR1 is in almost equal abundance in resting, <lb/>alternatively and classically activated macrophages. This indicates that macrophage <lb/>activation (as signal 1) induces activation or transcription or translocation of an E3 <lb/>ligase. This unknown E3 ligase then ubiquitylates, after MSR1 ligation (signal 2), the <lb/>receptor, enabling proinflammatory signalling through the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signalling <lb/>complex (Figure 6C). During inflammation, this signalling probably does not add <lb/>substantially to the macrophage phenotype as TLR or IL1R activation induces a much <lb/>stronger pro-inflammatory signal. However, in M2 or tissue-resident macrophages <lb/>with a similar M2-like phenotype, prolonged MSR1 ligation could lead to a pro-<lb/>inflammatory switch of these macrophage subsets via JNK. Interestingly, recent data <lb/>in Drosophila showed that apoptotic corpses prime macrophages for detection of <lb/></body>

			<body>tissue damage and that this priming and subsequent recruitment to wounds was <lb/>dependent on JNK (Weavers et al., 2016). This suggests that JNK activation induced by <lb/>uptake of apoptotic bodies could regulate various responses. <lb/>MSR1 has in recent years been established as a good marker for TAMs <lb/>(Allavena &amp; Mantovani, 2012) which resemble rather a M2 alternatively activated <lb/>phenotype and have been associated with tumour promotion (Sica et al., 2007). While <lb/>previously it was shown that lack of MSR1 delayed the growth of EL4 lymphoma in <lb/>mice by increased pro-inflammatory responses to necrotic cells (Komohara et al., <lb/>2009), our data revealed an increased expression of K63-polyubiquitylated MSR1 in a <lb/>human ovarian cancer. This coincided with increased activation of JNK pro-<lb/>inflammatory signalling pathway, suggesting that the MSR1-JNK signalling pathway is <lb/>activated in the progression of cancer. Interestingly, MSR1 has been previously shown <lb/>to promote tumour progression and metastasis in ovarian and pancreatic cancer <lb/>mouse models (Neyen et al., 2013), suggesting that MSR1 and downstream signalling <lb/>may be a potential drug target in the prevention of cancer metastasis progression. <lb/></body>

At day three, the cells <lb/>in supernatant were transferred to untreated 10 cm Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) for <lb/>seven days for the differentiation into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). <lb/>Then, BMDMs were treated by either IL-4 (20 ng/ml, BD Pharmingen) for 48 h to get <lb/>M2(IL-4) Macrophages (Figure S1). <lb/>Phagosome isolation <lb/>For proteomic analysis, phagosomes were isolated from BMDMs according to previous <lb/>methods (Desjardins et al., 1994, Trost et al., 2009). Latex beads of 0.8 µm <lb/>(Estapor/Merck, Fontenay Sous Bois, France) were diluted 1:50 in complete DMEM <lb/>media and incubated with treated and untreated BMDMs for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. <lb/>Cells were then harvested on ice, washed in cold PBS, and phagosomes were isolated <lb/>as described in previous works (Guo et al., 2015, Trost et al., 2009). Enriched protein <lb/>extracts contained less than 5% contamination from other cellular organelles as <lb/>estimated from immunoblotting experiments (Figure S2A). <lb/>For pull down assays, phagosomes were isolated using 1 µm magnetic beads <lb/>(Estapor/Merck).

The percentage of BMDMs that had interacted with <lb/>apoptotic cells was quantified by FACS analysis of AF488 positive cells. A minimum of <lb/>50,000 events within the macrophage gate was acquired. <lb/>Sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis <lb/>Phagosome proteins were extracted using 1% sodium 3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-<lb/>dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy]-1-propanesulfonate (commercially available as RapiGest, <lb/>Waters) in 50 mM pH 8.0 Tris, reduced with 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine <lb/>(TCEP), and alkylated by 5 mM iodoacetamide (30 min, room temperature, in the dark) <lb/>(Sigma) and then quenched by 10 mM DTT.
