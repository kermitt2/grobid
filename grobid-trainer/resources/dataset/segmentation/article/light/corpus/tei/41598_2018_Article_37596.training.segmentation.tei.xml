Ölander, I. Muukkonen, t. p. saarela &amp; V. R. salmela <lb/>simple visual items and complex real-world objects are stored into visual working memory as a <lb/>collection of independent features, not as whole or integrated objects. storing faces into memory might <lb/>differ, however, since previous studies have reported perceptual and memory advantage for whole faces <lb/>compared to other objects. We investigated whether facial features can be integrated in a statistically <lb/>optimal fashion and whether memory maintenance disrupts this integration. the observers adjusted a <lb/>probe -either a whole face or isolated features (eyes or mouth region) -to match the identity of a target <lb/>while viewing both stimuli simultaneously or after a 1.5 second retention period. Precision was better <lb/>for the whole face compared to the isolated features. perceptual precision was higher than memory <lb/>precision, as expected, and memory precision further declined as the number of memorized items was <lb/>increased from one to four. Interestingly, the whole-face precision was better predicted by models <lb/>assuming injection of memory noise followed by integration of features than by models assuming <lb/>integration of features followed by the memory noise. the results suggest equally weighted or optimal <lb/>integration of facial features and indicate that feature information is preserved in visual working <lb/>memory while remembering faces. <lb/></front>

			<body>Faces contain socially important information and consequently our visual system is very sensitive locating and <lb/>detecting faces 1 and a large network of brain areas is specialized in processing of faces 2,3 . Facial information <lb/>can be roughly divided into two categories: changeable features, such as emotional expressions, and invariant <lb/>features, such as identity. Previous studies suggest that changeable and invariant features are, at least partly, pro-<lb/>cessed by different mechanisms 4 . Monkey single cell studies 5 and human fMRI studies 6 have shown evidence for <lb/>norm-based coding of identities, suggesting that identities are represented in a multidimensional facial feature <lb/>space 7 . Different facial features, however, contribute differently for face perception; the regions around mouth and <lb/>eyes are most informative 8,9 and the discriminability of head shape and hair-line is better than discriminability of <lb/>mouth, eyes and eyebrows 10 . <lb/>A common notion in the literature of face perception is that of holistic or configural processing 11-14 , which <lb/>suggests that the perception of a whole, upright face is different from its parts or faces presented upside-down. <lb/>The whole face benefit might be due to an optimal integration of facial features. Previously, statistically optimal <lb/>integration has been studied in face recognition by measuring contrast thresholds 15,16 . In these studies contrast <lb/>thresholds for identity recognition were measured using facial features in small circular apertures, and compared <lb/>to the contrast threshold of the whole face (i.e., all features presented at the same time). The results suggested <lb/>that facial feature integration is optimal 15,16 or supra-optimal when spatial uncertainty to feature locations was <lb/>added 17 . Optimal integration of facial form and motion cues was also found in identity matching task with high <lb/>contrast synthetic faces 18 . <lb/>The representations of faces, and visual objects in general, can deteriorate due to several factors. Recognition <lb/>may be impaired due to visual clutter or noise, holding visual representations in memory for prolonged time, or <lb/>trying to remember several objects at the same time. According to current understanding of visual working mem-<lb/>ory, there is a trade-off between the memory capacity and precision 19-23 , that is, the more objects we try to remem-<lb/>ber, the less precise the memory representations are. For primary visual features, the decline in memory precision <lb/>due to multiple items in memory can be explained by an increasing noise during memory maintenance. For <lb/>complex items containing multiple features, the memory noise can have several effects. If the individual features <lb/>are bound together to form object representations 24 , the memory noise could also affect the binding or integra-<lb/>tion, in addition to the features. Previous studies suggest independent storing of different features of simple 25-27 <lb/>and complex visual objects 28 . Upright faces, however, are remembered better than other complex visual objects 29 <lb/></body>

			<body>or faces presented upside-down 30 . Thus, for images of human faces, memory noise could corrupt the whole, inte-<lb/>grated face representation, it could have different effects on different features if they are independently stored, or <lb/>it could disrupt the integration or binding as such. <lb/>We studied integration of facial features using high-contrast images of real faces and a task where the observer <lb/>adjusted the identity of a probe face or an isolated feature to match a target face/feature (Fig. 1A,D). The stimuli <lb/>were presented side-by-side (perception; Fig. 1B) or sequentially with a retention period in between the target and <lb/>probe (memory; Fig. 1C). In the memory condition we varied memory load and the observers had to memorize <lb/>one to four identities. Precision of adjustment was estimated by fitting a wrapped Cauchy distribution to the dis-<lb/>tribution of adjustment errors. We computed predictions for the whole-face stimulus in the perception condition <lb/>assuming a model observer who optimally integrates the two features (eye and mouth region). Human observers&apos; <lb/>performance was well predicted by this model. We then predicted the performance for the whole face stimulus in <lb/>the memory conditions assuming that the whole face is affected by memory noise in the same way the individual <lb/>features are. We tested several models, assuming that either faces are stored as integrated objects or that features <lb/>are stored separately, and assuming that either most reliable cue is used, cues are equally weighted or optimally <lb/>integrated. The human data was best predicted by models assuming optimal or equally weighted integration of <lb/>separately stored features. <lb/>Results <lb/>precision of adjustments. In the perception experiment, the observers viewed two stimuli presented <lb/>side-by-side and adjusted the stimuli on the right side to match in identity the stimuli on the left side (Fig. 1B). <lb/>Although the stimuli were constantly visible, the perceptual matching of identity was not perfect. Instead, the <lb/>adjustment errors formed distributions, which were well fit by a wrapped Cauchy distribution for each individual <lb/>observer (data and fits for observer 6 shown in Fig. 2, perception data in the first column). The error distributions <lb/>were narrower for the whole face than for the eyes and mouth stimuli (Fig. 2, first, second and third rows, respec-<lb/>tively). The same pattern of results was found in the average data (Fig. 3, first column). <lb/>The mean ± s.e.m circular standard deviation of perceptual errors was 0.44 ± 0.049, 0.56 ± 0.084, and <lb/>0.56 ± 0.082 radians for faces, eyes, and mouth, respectively. The width of the error distribution was narrower <lb/>for whole faces than for eyes (one-sided t(7) = 2.67, p = 0.016; BF 10 = 5.17) and mouth (one-sided t(7) = 3.13, <lb/>p = 0.008; BF 10 = 8.64), while no difference between the eyes and mouth was found (t(7) = 0.035, p = 0.973; <lb/>BF 10 = 0.336). The corresponding mean ± s.e.m concentration ρ values of the fitted wrapped Cauchy distribu-<lb/>tion, were 0.81 ± 0.022, 0.77 ± 0.037 and 0.77 ± 0.041, for faces, eyes and mouth, respectively. The concentra-<lb/>tion parameter was higher for whole faces than for eyes (one-sided t(7) = 2.20, p = 0.032; BF 10 = 3.020) and <lb/>mouth (one-sided t(7) = 1.96, p = 0.046; BF 10 = 2.288), but no difference was found for isolated eyes and mouth <lb/>(t(7) = 0.070, p = 0.946; BF 10 = 0.337). The Bayesian tests provided confirmatory evidence in favor for our hypoth-<lb/>eses (all BFs &gt; 2.8), and in favor for null hypotheses when isolated features were compared (BFs &lt; 0.34). Thus the <lb/>perceptual precision was better for the whole face than isolated features, but the precision for features did not <lb/>differ from each other. <lb/>To further test the difference between the features and faces, two additional fits of Cauchy distributions were <lb/>made. The first model -reported above -contained separate parameters for all stimulus types. The second model <lb/>contained different parameters for features and faces, and the third model contained same parameter for all <lb/>Figure 1. Stimuli and experimental setup.

			<body>In the second experiment a 1.5 second memory period was added between the target and probe stimuli, and <lb/>the observers&apos; task was to adjust the probe to match the target identity in memory (Fig. 1C). Consequently, <lb/>the width of the adjustment error distribution increased. This was evident already with just one stimulus to be <lb/>remembered (Fig. 2/3, second column). Adding the retention interval to the task doubled the averaged standard <lb/>deviation of errors to 0.92 ± 0.059, 1.09 ± 0.073, and 0.97 ± 0.048 radians for faces, eyes and mouth, respectively. <lb/>When the memory load was increased from one to four (Fig. 2/3, columns 2-5), the width of the error distri-<lb/>butions further increased and the mean ± s.e.m standard deviation of errors for four items was 1.56 ± 0.078, <lb/>1.62 ± 0.055, 1.60 ± 0.062 radians for faces, eyes and mouth, respectively). However, even with the largest mem-<lb/>ory load, the observers were able to memorize the stimuli and the error distributions were not flat (Fig. 2/3, <lb/>column five). <lb/>The effect of memory load on the standard deviation of errors was statistically highly significant <lb/>(F(3,21) = 79.95, p &lt; 0.001; Log(BF 10 ) = 54.73) as well as the main effect of stimulus type (F(2,14) = 7.83 p = 0.005; <lb/>BF 10 = 44.77). There was, however, no interaction between the stimulus type and memory load (F(6,42) = 1.32, <lb/>p = 0.272; BF 10 = 0.269) suggesting that the memory precision declined similarly for individual features and <lb/>the whole face. Similar results were found for the concentration parameter of the fitted distributions, main <lb/>effects of load (F(3,21) = 97.95, p &lt; 0.001; Log(BF 10 ) = 60.470) and stimulus type (F(2,14) = 10.637, p = 0.002; <lb/>Log(BF 10 ) = 6.411), but no interaction (F(6,42) = 0.887, p = 0.513; BF 10 = 0.171). The low BF in the last (0.171) <lb/>test provides quite strong evidence against the interaction of load and stimulus type. <lb/>When fitting additional models to the memory data, better fits were obtained with models that contained a <lb/>separate concentration parameter for features and whole face, except for highest memory load (mean ± s.e.m AIC <lb/>differences between third and second model were 0.27 ± 0.94, 1.48 ± 1.48, 0.08 ± 0.63, and −1.27 ± 0.38 (sum <lb/>over observers: 2.16, 11.86, 0.68, and −10.13); AIC differences between third and first model were 0.03 ± 1.38, <lb/>0.41 ± 1.53, −0.21 ± 1.10, and −1.61 ± 0.96 (sum over observers: 0.24, 3.3, −1.64, and −12.85)). And again due <lb/>to similar concentration for eyes and mouth, separate parameters for eyes and mouth did not provide benefit <lb/>(AIC difference between second and first model were −0.24 ± 0.96, −1.07 ± 0.31, −0.29 ± 0.69, and −0.34 ± 0.81 <lb/>(sum over observers: −1.92, −8.55, −2.32, and −2.72)). <lb/>One possible explanation for the difference between the features and the whole faces is that the observers <lb/>enjoyed the whole face condition more and therefore spent more time in adjusting the probe in the whole face <lb/>condition. However, the Bayesian test revealed evidence against an effect of condition (eyes vs. mouth vs. face) <lb/>on adjustment durations in perception (F(2,14) = 0.752, p = 0.489; BF 10 = 0.381) or in memory experiment <lb/>(F(2,14) = 2.126, p = 0.156; BF 10 = 0.313). In the memory experiment, memory load had no main effect on dura-<lb/>tions (F(3,21) = 0.559, p = 0.648; BF 10 = 0.095), and no interaction with stimulus type (F(6,42) = 0.315, p = 0.925; <lb/>BF 10 = 0.094). In the latter tests, the evidence against any effects is particularly strong (BF less than 0.1), indicating <lb/>that observers in all condition made similar effort in adjusting the probe stimulus. In perception experiment, the <lb/>mean ± s.e.m durations for faces, eyes, and mouths were 11.0 ± 0.81, 10.3 ± 1.32, and 11.7 ± 1.51 seconds, respec-<lb/>tively. In memory experiments, observers spent much less time adjusting the probe, the mean ± s.e.m durations <lb/>for faces, eyes, and mouths were 6.3 ± 0.68, 6.6 ± 0.72, and 6.2 ± 0.73 seconds. <lb/>To summarize all the results, the average and individual precision (i.e., concentration parameter ρ of the fitted <lb/>wrapped Cauchy distributions) in perception and memory experiments are shown in Fig. 4A,B, respectively. <lb/>Perceptual precision was substantially better than memory precision, as expected. On average, precision was <lb/>better for the whole face than for the isolated features in every condition (Fig. 4A), although there was some <lb/>Figure 4. Results from both experiments.

			<body>individual variation (Fig. 4B). For 7/8 observers the perceptual precision and for 5-7/8 observers the mnemonic <lb/>precision was better for the whole face than for isolated features, depending on the memory load (Fig. 4B). <lb/>Modeling. Since the precision of the isolated features did not reach the precision of the whole face (Fig. 4A), <lb/>it seems that the facial features are integrated when matching facial identities of the whole face. To quantify the <lb/>feature integration, we predicted the whole face performance based on the performance with isolated features <lb/>and assuming optimal integration. We assumed that three independent sources of noise (feature, memory delay, <lb/>and load) limit precision. We estimated the precision of each type of noise from the isolated feature data (eyes and <lb/>mouth), separately for each observer (see Methods). The fits captured the effects of memory on precision well, <lb/>and the estimated precision in each condition and for every observer was very close to the observed data (Fig. 5). <lb/>We then tested for integration of features in the whole-face condition. We devised two versions of an <lb/>optimal-integration model, in which memory noise corrupts perceptual precision before (Feature Model) or after <lb/>(Object Model) the integration of features, and compared human observer performance against model predic-<lb/>tions. In addition, we fitted two versions of an equal-weighting-of-cues model, in which the cues were integrated <lb/>before or after memory noise, and a most-reliable-cue model. The predictions of the optimal-integration models <lb/>are shown in Fig. 6, along with the whole-face data replotted from Fig. 4. The perception-only (no memory <lb/>load) prediction is identical for the two models, and especially the average data (Fig. 6A) is in accordance with <lb/>this prediction. Both models predict a similar and systematic decline in performance as a function of memory <lb/>load, but the Feature Model, in which memory noise corrupts precision before integration, predicts better per-<lb/>formance overall in the memory conditions. Averaged over observers, the Feature Model also more accurately <lb/>Figure 5. Fit and measured precision values, all observers and memory loads. See text for details. <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>predicts performance. The individual observer data (Fig. 6B) are noisy, but based on likelihood ratios, the Feature <lb/>Model better predicted performance for 6 out of 8 observers. When comparing all fitted models, for 6/8 observ-<lb/>ers, higher likelihoods were found for models containing integration of features after memory noise rather than <lb/>before memory noise. For 3/8 observers the best model contained optimal integration, for 3/8 observers the best <lb/>model was equal weighting, and for two observers the most reliable cue provided the best fit for data. The predic-<lb/>tions of the optimal-integration and equal-weighting-of-cues models were very similar. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We investigated integration of facial features in a face identity matching task, and tested whether adding a reten-<lb/>tion period and an increasing memory load disrupts feature integration in memory. To this end, we measured <lb/>adjustment errors for facial features and the whole face while observers matched stimuli presented side-by-side <lb/>as well as stimuli separated by a memory interval. The perceptual and mnemonic precision for the whole face <lb/>was better than for the isolated features, and the precision decreased due to retention period and memory <lb/>load. Memory precision for the whole face was well predicted by models with late integration of noisy features. <lb/>Alternative models -early integration of features followed by an additive memory noise -underestimated mem-<lb/>ory precision. We compared optimal integration with equal weighting of cues and choosing most reliable cue. The <lb/>results suggest that facial features are integrated in statistically optimal fashion or by equally weighting features, <lb/>and that feature information is preserved while memorizing complex objects. <lb/>A growing amount of evidence suggests flexible resources in visual working memory 31,32 . According to current <lb/>understanding, we can trade precision with capacity, that is, remember only few items very precisely or larger <lb/>amount of objects with less resolution. This can be achieved either by continuous resources 21,33 , variable preci-<lb/>sion 19,20 or by averaging discrete memory representations for improved precision 23 . Most studies on the precision <lb/>of working memory have used simple visual features or shapes as stimuli to be memorized. With more complex <lb/>or naturalistic stimuli, such as images of human faces, the precision of memory representations can decrease in <lb/>several ways. We can remember complex objects either as a whole object, or as a collection of features combined <lb/>with binding information 24,34 . <lb/>Memory binding is typically studied with combining simple visual features, such as color and orientation. <lb/>Previous studies suggests that memory loads affects binding 25 and emphasize feature locations, that is, features <lb/>are bound mainly due to the shared location 35,36 . Features of simple visual objects are independently stored 25-27 . <lb/>Similarly, complex, real-world objects are not remembered as unitary or bound objects since the memorability of <lb/>features are partly independent 28 . Our results with faces suggest that memory noise similarly degrades both the <lb/>isolated features as well as the integrated objects, that is, there was no interaction between the memory load and <lb/>stimulus type. Furthermore, predicting the memory precision for the whole face with different models favored <lb/>the models in which memory noise was added before feature integration. This suggests that unfamiliar faces are <lb/>stored in memory as collection of features or that feature information is preserved while storing facial identity <lb/>in working memory. Interestingly, storing a face as an integrated object is not the most optimal strategy since -<lb/>according to our modeling -storing features separately predicted better memory performance. Although there <lb/>was some variability, majority of our observers seemed to utilize this strategy. <lb/>It has been suggested that visually complex objects employ more working memory resources than visually sim-<lb/>ple objects 37 . In our experiment the whole-face stimuli were remembered more precisely than the single-feature <lb/>stimuli, although faces are visually more complex. However, the precision declined similarly for both whole face <lb/>and isolated features. There are several advantages for faces compared to other visual objects. Faces are remem-<lb/>bered better than other objects, if the encoding time is long enough 29 , and more precisely than line orientations <lb/>when multiple items need to be remembered 38 . Face inversion effect has also been reported during memory main-<lb/>tenance, that is, memory precision for upright faces is better than for upside-down faces 30 . Our results suggest <lb/>that the memory advantage for faces is not due to storing faces as integrated objects. <lb/>The difference in precision between facial features and the whole faces was not as large as we expected on the <lb/>basis of holistic or efficient processing of whole upright faces. Furthermore, the precision for mouth and eyes <lb/>was quite similar in all conditions. These could be due to our feature stimuli; the whole face was split in half and <lb/>we compared identity information in the lower and upper part of the face. The whole face benefit, as well as the <lb/>difference between the features, would likely be larger if facial features would be chosen with a smaller aperture, <lb/>i.e., just a left eye, or an eye without the eyebrow. Furthermore, the reliability of different cues could be varied with <lb/>varying aperture size, which in turn would make predictions of optimal integration and equal weighting of cues <lb/>more different. In the current data, we cannot separate these two models. <lb/>All the identities we used were unfamiliar to the observers. Identity processing differs between unfamiliar and <lb/>familiar faces, and facial expertise is more pronounced with familiar faces 39 . With familiar faces, observers would <lb/>have had much more exposure to the stimuli and different memory representations, and they would likely have <lb/>used different strategies or weighting of features while memorizing identities. However, as the main interest of the <lb/>study was short-term or working memory, long-term memory representation of familiar faces could have affected <lb/>these processes, as observers could have used other identity information, such as names, while memorizing faces. <lb/>Previously optimal integration of facial features has been shown for detection of faces at contrast threshold 15-17 <lb/>as well as discrimination identity of dynamic synthetic faces 18 . In accordance with these studies, our results sug-<lb/>gest optimal integration or equal weighting of facial features in an adjustment task. In comparison to the previous <lb/>integration studies, we added a retention period and varied the memory load. The memory maintenance or <lb/>load did not have much effect on the integration as such. In conclusion, our results suggest optimal integration <lb/>or equal weighting of facial features in identity matching task, and that faces are stored as collection of features, <lb/>which are integrated during retrieval. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>observers. Eight observers (4 female, 22-31 years) with normal or corrected to normal vision and without <lb/>known deficits in face perception participated in the experiment. All observers received a study credit for partic-<lb/>ipating. All the experiments were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informed <lb/>consent was collected from the observers before the measurements, and the experiments were approved by the <lb/>Ethics Review Board in the Humanities and Social and Behavioural Sciences of the University of Helsinki. <lb/>stimuli. We chose 60 face images depicting different identities from the Radboud 40 and FACES 41 databases. <lb/>All faces had a neutral expression. Half of the identities were female and half male. Images were divided into <lb/>groups of three and morphed from one identity to another by using Abrosoft FantaMorph software. As a result, 20 <lb/>different circular identity spaces, which each contained 300 images in total, were formed. In each of these spaces <lb/>the identity changed continuously between the three original identities (Fig. 1A). The gender did not change <lb/>within the identity space. <lb/>The three different stimulus types, whole face, mouth region (lower part of the face) and eye region (upper <lb/>part of the face), were obtained by applying Gaussian masks to the images (Fig. 1D). The masks were identical <lb/>across all identities. The whole faces were first extracted from the original images with a mask, which shape was <lb/>determined by two radial frequency components (first component: RF = 2, amplitude = 0.22, phase = 270°; sec-<lb/>ond component: RF = 3, amplitude = 0.04, phase = 180°). The eye and mouth regions were extracted from the <lb/>whole face with masks defined by a sum of Gaussians, i.e., the eye region was extracted with two Gaussians <lb/>around the left and right eye and the mouth region with two Gaussians around the nose and mouth. The standard <lb/>deviations of the Gaussian masks for the left and right eye were σ = . °1 <lb/>6 <lb/>x <lb/>and σ = . °0 <lb/>8 <lb/>y <lb/>, for nose σ = . °0 <lb/>6 <lb/>x <lb/>and <lb/>σ = . °0 <lb/>8 <lb/>y <lb/>, and mouth σ = . °2 <lb/>0 <lb/>x <lb/>and σ = . °1 <lb/>2 <lb/>y <lb/>. The size (width/height) of the whole face, eyes and mouth were <lb/>4.1° × 6.0°, 4.1° × 1.7° and 3.7° × 3.2°, respectively. Gray-scale faces/features were displayed on a mid-gray back-<lb/>ground and the RMS-contrast of the stimuli was 0.19 ± 0.01. All the image processing was conducted with Matlab. <lb/>Experiments were conducted in a dimly lit room. Stimuli were shown on a linearized VIEWPixx monitor <lb/>(VPixx Technologies Inc., Canada). Observers sat 92 cm away from the monitor and their head rested on a <lb/>chin-forehead stand. The viewing area extended 29.5 × 18.8 degrees. The stimulus presentation was controlled <lb/>with Psychophysics Toolbox extension of Matlab 42 . <lb/>procedure. The precision of perceiving and remembering facial identity was measured with the method of <lb/>adjustment. Two experiments (perception and memory) were conducted using three different types of stimuli: <lb/>(1) the whole face, (2) mouth region only, and (3) eye region only. In the perception experiment, a target stimulus <lb/>and a probe stimulus were presented simultaneously, side-by-side (Fig. 1B). The observers&apos; task was to adjust <lb/>the identity of the probe to match the target. The target and the probe were always similar, i.e., whole face, or <lb/>eye or mouth region. The target was always on the left side of the display and the probe on the right side of the <lb/>display. The observer used up/down arrow keys for coarse adjustment (4.8° steps in the identity space) and left/ <lb/>right arrow keys for precise adjustment (1.2° steps in the identity space). When the observer was content with the <lb/>adjustment, he/she initiated the next trial by pressing the spacebar. The maximal adjustment time was limited to <lb/>30 seconds. The positions of the target and the starting position of the probe stimulus in the identity space were <lb/>random, except the probe was initially at least ± 30° away from the target. For visual feedback on the identity <lb/>space, there was a thin black circle around the probe stimulus, and a black dot moved along the circle according <lb/>to observers&apos; adjustment (Fig. 1B). <lb/>In the memory experiment, memory precision was measured while varying the memory load. First, 1-4 stim-<lb/>uli were shown and the observers&apos; task was to memorize the identities of the stimuli. The stimuli were always <lb/>shown on the same, fixed locations, and for 0.5 s per face, i.e., one face was shown for 0.5 s and three faces were <lb/>shown for 1.5 s. After a 1.5 s retention period, a probe stimulus was presented on the bottom of the screen, and the <lb/>observers&apos; adjusted the probe stimulus to match the target identity, which was indicated with a spatial cue (outline <lb/>of the face; Fig. 1C). The adjustments were done similarly as in the perception experiment. In the conditions with <lb/>more than one stimulus, all of the stimuli were always from different identity circles. <lb/>All observers conducted the perception experiment first. For each experiment and condition, 120 trials were <lb/>measured in two blocks of 60 trials. The order of the four memory loads and three stimulus types, and the two <lb/>blocks in the memory experiment were randomized and balanced across observers. In every block, all of the 20 <lb/>identity spaces were probed three times, once in each third of the circular space. <lb/>Data analysis. The adjustment error on each trial was obtained by computing the angle between the adjusted <lb/>identity and the target identity in the circular identity space. To quantify the precision of the adjustments, we fit <lb/>wrapped Cauchy distributions 43 to the adjustment error distributions. Wrapped Cauchy density function is given by: <lb/>θ µ ρ <lb/>π <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>θ µ <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>f ( ; , ) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 cos( <lb/>) <lb/>(1) <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>where θ is the angle, µ is a location parameter, and the concentration parameter ρ defines the precision, varying <lb/>between 0 (uniform circular distribution) and 1 (distribution concentrated at µ). Fitting was done separately <lb/>for each observer, condition, and stimulus type by numerically finding the maximum likelihood values for the <lb/>parameters given the data. The mean on the distribution (location parameter µ) was set to zero. We used wrapped <lb/>Cauchy instead of von Mises distribution because von Mises failed to capture the shape of the error distribution, <lb/>especially when the error distribution was very concentrated. We quantified the difference in the goodness of fit <lb/>between the wrapped Cauchy and von Mises by comparing their log-likelihoods. Average log-likelihood ratio for <lb/>wrapped Cauchy vs. von Mises was 21.97 ± 7.97, confirming that wrapped Cauchy gave a better fit. In addition, <lb/></body>

			<body>we confirmed that the shape of the distributions did not differ between eyes, mouths and whole faces by fitting <lb/>wrapped stable distribution 44 to the data with shape and concentration as free parameters. The shape parameter <lb/>value 1 corresponds to a wrapped Cauchy distribution and value 2 corresponds to a wrapped Gaussian distribu-<lb/>tion. The mean ± s.e.m shape values were 1.08 ± 0.048, 1.14 ± 0.066 and 1.07 ± 0.091 for mouth, eyes, and face, <lb/>respectively, and did no differ significantly from each other. All further analyses and modeling were done using <lb/>wrapped Cauchy. <lb/>In contrast to some previous studies on visual memory, we used only a circular distribution, not a mixture of a <lb/>circular and a uniform distribution, since the wrapped Cauchy alone gave a good fit for the data. Further, for the <lb/>modeling (see below) it was essential to get a good estimate of precision in each experimental condition, and this <lb/>becomes problematic with a mixture of a circular and a uniform distribution, since the spread of the observations <lb/>could be absorbed either by the weight of the uniform distribution or the concentration parameter of the circular <lb/>distribution, especially when the spread is large. <lb/>Statistical analyses were conducted with JASP software 45,46 . Paired sample t-tests and repeated measures <lb/>ANOVAs were used as well as Bayesian paired samples t-tests and Bayesian ANOVAs. The t-tests were two-sided <lb/>unless otherwise noted. The Bayes Factors (BF) are reported relative to the null model and in two-way ANOVAs <lb/>the BF are reported relative to the null model including the other effects. <lb/>Modeling. We developed a model to investigate whether facial features are optimally integrated for identifi-<lb/>cation. The model assumes independent processing and statistically optimal integration of noisy features, and a <lb/>further corruption of precision during memory maintenance by additional neural noise. <lb/>During the experiment, the observer adjusts one of the two stimuli so that the &apos;perceptual distance&apos; between <lb/>the two is minimized. The model observer does this using a noisy decision variable r, which is a difference of noisy <lb/>&apos;internal responses&apos; to the two stimuli: r = r 1 − r 2 . We assumed there are three independent sources of noise in the <lb/>task. First, there is noise related to the coding of the features, which corrupts the responses to both the target and <lb/>the probe stimuli. Second, we assumed two sources of zero-mean noise related to memory: noise related to the <lb/>delay or retention period itself, and noise that increases with memory load. Convolution of two wrapped Cauchy <lb/>distributions is again a wrapped Cauchy distribution with a concentration parameter that is the product of the <lb/>concentration parameters of the original distributions 47 . The effect of memory noise can thus be modeled as: <lb/>ρ ρ <lb/>ρ ρ <lb/>= <lb/>(2) <lb/>feature delay load <lb/>n <lb/>2 <lb/>where ρ feature reflects the precision in the representation of the eye or mouth region (ρ eyes or ρ mouth , squared because <lb/>on each trial there are two stimuli, the target and the probe), ρ delay is the precision of the noise due to the retention <lb/>period, and ρ load is for the noise due to each of the n additional items kept in memory. In the perception condi-<lb/>tion, ρ delay and ρ load are both equal to 1. We fit this model to the precision estimates extracted from the data from <lb/>isolated eyes and mouth conditions to estimate the noise related to the two features, memory delay, and memory <lb/>load, separately for each observer. We set the mean to zero (location parameter µ = 0) for all distributions. <lb/>We then predicted the observer&apos;s performance in the whole face task assuming optimal integration of <lb/>the features (i.e, maximum likelihood estimation of identity given responses to features). As we did not have <lb/>&apos;cue-conflict&apos; conditions, that is, the eye and mouth region always had the same identity, we assume the responses <lb/>to the two features have the same mean. To model the perception condition, we took the precision estimates for <lb/>the features ρ eyes and ρ mouth and simulated 10 4 &apos;trials&apos; by drawing random samples (&apos;responses&apos;) from the corre-<lb/>sponding wrapped Cauchy distributions. For each response, we computed the likelihood function for the true <lb/>stimulus value given the response. As we assumed independent processing of the features, the combined likeli-<lb/>hood is simply the product of the feature-specific likelihoods: <lb/>| = <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>p r <lb/>r <lb/>I <lb/>p r I p r <lb/>I <lb/>, <lb/>( <lb/>) ( <lb/>) <lb/>(3) <lb/>eyes mouth <lb/>e yes <lb/>m outh <lb/>where I is the stimulus value (identity). The model observer made a maximum likelihood estimate of the identity <lb/>by picking the value of I that maximized this likelihood. To quantify the model observer&apos;s performance, we fit a <lb/>wrapped Cauchy distribution to the errors in the same way as we did for the human data. <lb/>To model the memory conditions, we devised two versions of the optimal integration model, which differ in <lb/>how memory noise corrupts the responses: In the first model, the features are first integrated, and the maximum <lb/>likelihood estimate is then corrupted by memory noise. In the second model, the responses to the features are <lb/>first corrupted by memory noise before being integrated. Additionally, we tested a model with equal weight-<lb/>ing of the two cues (as we did not systematically manipulate cue reliability, this is likely to be very close to the <lb/>optimal-integration model), and a model where the observer chooses the most reliable cue. <lb/></body>
