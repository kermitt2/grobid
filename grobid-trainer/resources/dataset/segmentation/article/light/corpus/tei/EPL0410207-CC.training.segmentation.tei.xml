			<body>The upper critical field H c2 of high-T c superconduc-<lb/>tors remains a contradictory issue. In classical type-II <lb/>superconductors this quantity has been unequivocally de-<lb/>termined from the magnetotransport measurement and <lb/>its temperature dependence can, in most cases, be well <lb/>described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) <lb/>theory [1]. However, for the high-T c superconductors, <lb/>H c2 extracted from magnetotransport data reveals an un-<lb/>usual increase with decreasing temperatures without any <lb/>saturation down to low temperatures. This upward cur-<lb/>vature is observed in a pronounced way in the supercon-<lb/>ducting cuprates Sm 2−x Ce x CuO 4 [2], Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ [3], <lb/>Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO y [4], and YBa (Cu 1−x Zn x )O 7−δ [5]. How-<lb/>ever, the effect is also found in the fully three dimensional <lb/>and non magnetic Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 [6]. Among others, a <lb/>bipolaron scenario [7], an unconventional normal state <lb/>[8], a strong electron-phonon coupling [9], the presence of <lb/>inhomogeneities and magnetic impurities [10] have been <lb/>put forward for an explanation of the anomalous H c2 (T ) <lb/>dependence. Because depinned vortices, either in the liq-<lb/>uid or solid state, cause a finite dissipative resistance be-<lb/>fore reaching the full transition to the normal state, the <lb/>complexity of the H − T phase diagram in high-T c &apos;s [11] <lb/>undermines any direct determination of the upper critical <lb/>field from magnetotransport data. There are indications <lb/>that, also in the fully 3D system of Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 , fluc-<lb/>tuations can lead to a melting of the vortex-glass state <lb/>[12]. This could be a reason complicating a determination <lb/>of H c2 from a dissipative measurement as magnetoresis-<lb/>tance. <lb/>Avoiding the dissipative mechanisms which could ob-<lb/>scure a determination of H c2 from transport measure-<lb/>ments, we show that tunneling measurements can be used <lb/>as an effective and direct method for the determination <lb/>of the upper critical field. The from tunneling obtained <lb/>temperature dependence of H c2 in Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 follows <lb/>the WHH model revealing a saturation at low tempera-<lb/>tures. At the tunneling H c2 values the resistance is very <lb/>close to the full resistive transition into the normal state <lb/>as measured on the same sample. This result was ob-<lb/>tained repeatedly on several samples. <lb/>The single-crystalline Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 samples grown by <lb/>electrochemical crystallisation were dark-blue crystals of <lb/>a cubic shape with a size of about 0.6 mm. The super-<lb/>conducting transition of our crystals was single stepped <lb/>and sharp with T c ≃ 23 K as determined by susceptibil-<lb/>ity measurements. The low temperature resistivity was <lb/>about 100 µΩcm with the metallic temperature depen-<lb/>dence. The tunnel junctions were prepared by painting <lb/>a silver spot of about 0.1 to 0.2 mm diameter on the sur-<lb/>face of the crystal. The interface between the silver and <lb/>Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 counter electrodes served as a natural bar-<lb/>rier forming a planar normal-insulator-superconductor <lb/>(N-I-S) tunnel junction. Low resistance electrical con-<lb/>tacts were prepared for the four-probe measurements of <lb/>the current-voltage (I-V ) and differential conductance <lb/>(dI/dV ) characteristics of the tunnel junction. The tun-<lb/>neling measurements were performed in magnetic fields <lb/>up to 30 T perpendicular to the planar junction enabling <lb/>the formation of the vortex state in the junction area. On <lb/>the same samples the magnetoresistance was measured <lb/>using a four-probe measurement at low frequencies. <lb/>Figure 1 shows the magnetoresistance R(H) of the <lb/>Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 single crystal up to 26 T at temperatures <lb/>from 1.5 K to T c ≃ 23 K. The resistive transitions are <lb/>shifted and broadened towards lower temperatures as the <lb/>magnetic field is increased, although the broadening is <lb/>much smaller than in the case of the cuprates. A sim-<lb/>ple evaluation of the transition field defined as H * (T ) <lb/>where R/R n equals, for instance, 0.1, 0.5, or 0.9 (R n is <lb/>the normal-state resistance) leads to a positive curvature <lb/>of H * (T ) down to the lowest temperatures. If H * (T ) is <lb/>defined for R even closer to R n , the curvature of H * (T ) <lb/>changes at the lowest temperatures which makes that the <lb/>dependence H * (T ) depends on the chosen criterion. <lb/>In the following the normalized tunneling conductances <lb/>of our junctions are presented, where the normal-state <lb/>conduction for the normalization is taken above H c2 (T ) <lb/>for the temperature T under investigation. Figure 2 <lb/>shows a quality certificate of our junction. The spectra <lb/></body>

The Γ smearing of the spectrum is <lb/>case dependent with a tendency Γ/∆ → in the best <lb/>junctions. As mentioned already in the original paper of <lb/>Dynes et al., such an &quot;intrinsic&quot; width of the spectrum <lb/>can be the consequence of anisotropy effects, noise, or <lb/>concentration fluctuations. The presence of microphases <lb/>due to fluctuations in the potassium and oxygen concen-<lb/>tration seems to be a general problem in a substitution <lb/>system like Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 [6]. The Dynes formula fits <lb/>our tunnel spectra at 1.5 K and zero magnetic field with <lb/>∆ = 3.9 ± 0.1 meV and Γ = 0.4 ± 0.1 meV, yielding <lb/>2∆/kT c = 3.9 ± 0.1 and indicating that Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 <lb/>is a BCS-like superconductor with a medium coupling <lb/>strength [14]. In the inset the temperature dependence <lb/>of the superconducting gap is shown for the data from <lb/>Fig.2 and also for data taken at B = 2 T. The broadening <lb/>parameter Γ is found to be independent of temperature. <lb/>At high magnetic fields the normalized tunneling con-<lb/>ductances of the Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 -Ag junction are displayed <lb/>in Fig.3 for different constant temperatures. With in-<lb/>creasing magnetic fields an increasing smearing of the <lb/>superconducting features in the tunneling spectra is ob-<lb/>served. At a certain field strength no structure from su-<lb/>perconductivity can be found anymore and the transi-<lb/>tion from a S-I-N to a N-I-N junction is accomplished. <lb/>Similar tunneling data have been obtained on a thin <lb/>Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 film in a parallel field up to 7 Tesla at <lb/>0.45 K [15]. Unlike a parallel-field configuration, our ex-<lb/>periment on a cubic single crystal involves the <lb/>FIG. 2. Differential conductance of the Ba1−xKxBiO3-Ag <lb/>tunnel junction measured at different temperatures. The inset <lb/>shows the temperature dependence of the superconducting <lb/>energy gap obtained from the tunneling conductances at zero <lb/>magnetic field and 2 T together with the BCS prediction (full <lb/>lines). <lb/>occurrence of a mixed state in a strong magnetic field. <lb/>In the mixed state the tunneling conductance will <lb/>probe an average of the local densities of states. For <lb/>an isolated vortex, the superconducting order parameter <lb/>is zero at the center, increases linearly up to a coherence-<lb/>length distance ξ away from the center where it saturates <lb/>to the zero-field value. The local quasi-particle density of <lb/>states (DOS) equals the normal-state DOS at the vortex <lb/>core, but is broadened near the vortex due to the pair-<lb/>breaking effect of the local magnetic field (as described by <lb/>the Abrikosov-Gor&apos;kov theory developed further by Maki, <lb/>de Gennes and others [16]). In the limit of moderate fields <lb/>(H &lt;&lt; H c2 ), Caroli, de Gennes and Matricon [17] have <lb/>shown that the main contribution to the density of states <lb/>at the Fermi energy comes from the low lying states local-<lb/>ized in a vortex core. Each isolated vortex gives a contri-<lb/>bution equivalent to a normal region of radius ξ yielding <lb/>for the density of states at the Fermi level ρ(0) ∝ ρ n (0)ξ 2 , <lb/>where ρ n (0) is the normal state DOS at the Fermi level. <lb/>Thus, the total averaged density of states at the Fermi <lb/>level is proportional to ρ n (0)ξ 2 per area (H c2 /H)ξ 2 oc-<lb/>cupied by one vortex giving ρ(0) ≃ ρ n (0)H/H c2 . How-<lb/>ever, of more relevance for critical field data, also close to <lb/>H c2 a linear field dependence of ρ(0) has been found by <lb/>solving the linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation in the <lb/>mixed state [18]. A very sensitive method to determine <lb/>the upper critical field from tunneling experiments is to <lb/>display the normalized zero-bias tunneling conductance <lb/>as a function of the field strength [19]. The observation <lb/>of a sharp transition is then taken as a proof of a good <lb/>homogeneity of the sample. <lb/>In Fig. 4 we present the zero-bias tunneling conduc-<lb/></body>

Normalized tunneling conductances in magnetic <lb/>fields from zero up to 30 T in steps of 2 T (if not mentioned <lb/>else) at the indicated temperatures. <lb/>tance as a function of the applied magnetic field for dif-<lb/>ferent temperatures. A linear dependence of dI/dV (0) as <lb/>a function of applied field can be found in a limited field <lb/>range. At the highest fields a &quot;tailing&quot; of the zero-bias <lb/>conductance towards the normal-state value is observed, <lb/>and a finite value of the zero-bias conductance is found <lb/>already at zero magnetic field. The latter effect is ob-<lb/>viously due to the Γ broadening. Also the tailing effect <lb/>at the highest fields could be related to the same cause <lb/>as the Γ broadening, i.e. a certain inhomogeneity in the <lb/>sample. The observed tailing effect resembles the behav-<lb/>ior in the resistive transition close to the transition into <lb/>the normal state (see Fig.1). A linear extrapolation of the <lb/>zero-bias conductance to the field where the normalized <lb/>conductance equals unity, as shown by the full lines in <lb/>Fig.4, has been used to determine the upper critical field. <lb/>Figure 5 shows the obtained temperature dependence of <lb/>the upper critical field H t <lb/>c2 (T ). Also the points H * (T ) <lb/>obtained from 90 % of the magnetoresistance transition <lb/>(R/R n = 0.9) are indicated. The slope of H t <lb/>c2 (T ) near T c <lb/>is different from that of the transition field H * (T ) deter-<lb/>mined from resistance data. We note that the tunneling <lb/>critical fields H t <lb/>c2 (T ) are at fields where the bulk resis-<lb/>tivity is very close to the onset of superconductivity (as <lb/>indicated by the arrows for H t <lb/>c2 in Fig.1). <lb/>As a very significant result, H t <lb/>c2 (T ) shows a clear sat-<lb/>uration at the lowest temperatures as expected for the <lb/>WHH theory. From all dissipative measurements on dif-<lb/>ferent samples of Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 so far done [6,12,15], <lb/>FIG. 4. Zero-bias tunneling conductances as a function of <lb/>magnetic field for all measured temperatures with the linear <lb/>extrapolation to obtain H t <lb/>c2 . <lb/>only a linear increase of H * (T ) for decreasing tem-<lb/>peratures has been obtained. Also recent susceptibility <lb/>measurements reveal this effect in the temperature de-<lb/>pendence of the irreversibility field [20,21] down to the <lb/>lowest temperatures (0.4 K in [20]). <lb/>Besides the above mentioned tailing effect in the zero-<lb/>bias tunneling-conductance and the bulk resistive transi-<lb/>tion near the superconducting transition, the same tailing <lb/>can also be observed near T c in ∆(T ) (see Fig.2) and in <lb/>H t <lb/>c2 (T ) (see below in Fig. 5). We suppose that, despite <lb/>the quality of our sample, stochiometric inhomogeneity <lb/>could play a role in this phenomenon. However, as we will <lb/>discuss below, a more intrinsic cause related to supercon-<lb/>ducting fluctuations could also explain this broadening in <lb/>the superconducting transition. <lb/>Klein et al. [12] suggested that in Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 a <lb/>vortex-glass melting transition driven by fluctuations <lb/>can obscure the magnetotransport determination of H c2 . <lb/>Their measurements of the electric field versus current <lb/>density E − J show that a second order phase transi-<lb/>tion from a vortex glass to a vortex liquid state does <lb/>exist in this system. The presence of the liquid phase <lb/>can induce strong fluctuations below H c2 related to the <lb/>motion of the flux lines, but these fluctuations can be <lb/>quite small above H c2 . This can be the reason why H c2 <lb/>(see arrows in Fig.1) is quite close to the onset of the <lb/>resistive transitions . In this approach the foot of the <lb/>resistive transition is determined by the melting of the <lb/>vortex lattice giving a positive curvature in the temper-<lb/>ature dependence of the line H g (T ) for the liquid-solid <lb/>transition. The foots of the curves in Fig.1 could be in-<lb/>deed well fitted as R ∼ [H/H g (T ) − 1] β corresponding to <lb/>the vortex glass melting theory as introduced by Fisher et <lb/>al. [22], where H g (T ) is the magnetic field of the melting <lb/>transition. The resulting fitting parameter β = 4.1 ± 0.5 <lb/></body>

Upper <lb/>closed circles -H t <lb/>c2 from tunneling, open triangles -H * from <lb/>magnetoresistance transition at R/Rn = 0.9, and closed <lb/>squares -the melting line Hg. <lb/>is in a perfect agreement with the value obtained on a <lb/>different Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 crystal with T c ≃ 31 K [12]. The <lb/>melting line H g (T ) reveals a positive curvature and can <lb/>be described by the power-law temperature dependence <lb/>H g = H g (0)(1 − T /T c ) 3/2 as shown in Fig. 5. This is <lb/>also in a good agreement with the recent measurement <lb/>of the irreversibility field on a similar sample [20] indi-<lb/>cating that the melting and irreversibility lines coincide <lb/>in Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 . <lb/>In the H − T phase-diagram of Fig.5 the initial slope <lb/>of the upper critical field (−dH c2 /dT ) Tc is about 1.7 ÷ <lb/>1.8 T/K. To emphasize more the fact of the saturation <lb/>of the upper critical field at the lowest temperatures, we <lb/>note the closeness of the zero-bias conductance data for <lb/>1.5, 3 and 4.2 K in comparison with the data taken at <lb/>other temperatures in Fig.4. In Fig.5 we also present <lb/>the WHH upper critical field line with an uncertainty <lb/>comparable to the experimental error bars. Taking into <lb/>account that in a system with important fluctuations the <lb/>H c2 boundary should not be very sharp a satisfactory <lb/>agreement is found. <lb/>We have presented here a direct non-dissipative de-<lb/>termination of the upper critical field in Ba 1−x K x BiO 3 <lb/>using the tunneling effect. H c2 (T ) can be satisfactorily <lb/>described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory. <lb/>In the Cu-oxides, the existence of a resistive state within <lb/>a large part of the H − T diagram complicates an unam-<lb/>biguous determination of the critical field from transport <lb/>data. Therefore, it would be very interesting (and deci-<lb/>sive for certain proposed superconducting mechanisms) <lb/>to study the upper critical field in the cuprates with the <lb/>non-dissipative tunneling method. <lb/></body>
