			<front>Abstract <lb/>CD95/Fas ligand binds to the death receptor CD95/Fas to induce apoptosis in sensitive cells. We <lb/>previously reported the CD95L mRNA is enriched in sequences that, when converted to <lb/>si/shRNAs, are toxic to cells (Putzbach et al., 2017). These si/shRNAs kill all cancer cells <lb/>through a RNAi off-target effect by targeting critical survival genes. We now report expression <lb/>of full-length CD95L mRNA, itself, is highly toxic to cells and induces a similar form of cell <lb/>death. We demonstrate that small RNAs derived from CD95L are loaded into the RNA induced <lb/>silencing complex (RISC) and that the RISC is required for the toxicity. Drosha and Dicer <lb/>knock-out cells are highly sensitive to this toxicity, suggesting that processing of CD95L mRNA <lb/>into small toxic RNAs is independent of both Dicer and Drosha. The data provide evidence that a <lb/>higher vertebrate transgene can be processed to RNAi-active small RNAs that elicit cellular <lb/>responses. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Activation of CD95/Fas through interaction with its cognate ligand CD95L or receptor-activating <lb/>antibodies induces apoptosis in sensitive cells (Suda, Takahashi, Golstein, &amp; Nagata, 1993). <lb/>Virtually all research on CD95 and CD95L has focused on the physical interaction between the <lb/>two proteins and the subsequent protein-based signaling cascades (Algeciras-Schimnich et al., <lb/>2002; Fu et al., 2016; Nisihara et al., 2001; Schneider et al., 1997). However, we have recently <lb/>shown that the mRNA of CD95 and CD95L harbor sequences that when converted into small <lb/>interfering (si) or short hairpin (sh)RNAs, cause massive and robust toxicity in all tested cancer <lb/>cells. These CD95/CD95L-derived si/shRNAs target a network of survival genes, resulting in the <lb/>simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways through RNA interference (RNAi) in a <lb/>process we called DISE (Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination) (Putzbach et al., 2017). <lb/>We determined that for an si/shRNA to elicit this form of toxicity, only positions 2-7 of the guide <lb/>strand, the 6mer seed sequence, are required (Putzbach et al., 2017). More recently, a screen of <lb/>all 4096 6mer seeds revealed that optimal 6mer seed toxicity requires G-rich seeds targeting C-<lb/>rich regions in the 3&apos;UTRs of survival genes (Gao et al., 2018). <lb/>In this report, we show that expression of the CD95L mRNA, itself, is toxic to cells even <lb/>without prior conversion to siRNAs. This toxicity is independent of the full-length CD95L <lb/>protein or expression of the CD95 receptor and resembles DISE. The toxicity involves RNAi, <lb/>and multiple small RNAs generated within cells from the mRNA of CD95L are loaded into the <lb/>RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC), the key mediator of RNAi (Liu et al., 2004). <lb/>Results <lb/>CD95L mRNA is toxic to cells <lb/>By testing every possible shRNA derived from the CD95L open reading frame (ORF) or its <lb/>3&apos;UTR, we recently found a high enrichment of toxic si/shRNAs derived from the CD95L ORF <lb/>(Putzbach et al., 2017). Most recently we determined that the 6mer seed toxicity observed in <lb/>many si/shRNAs is due to their nucleotide composition, with G-rich seeds being the most toxic <lb/>(Gao et al., 2018). When reanalyzing the CD95L ORF-derived shRNAs, we found a significant <lb/>correlation between the toxicity of the most toxic CD95L-derived shRNAs (Putzbach et al., <lb/>2017) and the seed toxicity of the same 6mer seed we recently determined in a screen of all 4096 <lb/>6mer seeds (Gao et al., 2018). This suggests that CD95L-derived shRNAs kill cancer cells <lb/>mainly through 6mer seed toxicity. <lb/></body>

			<body>We therefore wondered whether expression of the CD95L ORF mRNA-without pre-<lb/>processing into artificial siRNAs-would be toxic to cells. Expression of CD95L protein in most <lb/>cells kills through induction of apoptosis. Consequently, expressing CD95L in HeyA8 cells, <lb/>which are highly sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis, killed cells within a few hours after <lb/>infection with a lentivirus encoding CD95L (Figure 1A, left panel). Interestingly, severe growth <lb/>reduction was seen without any signs of apoptosis (not shown) when a CD95L mutant, unable to <lb/>bind CD95, was expressed (CD95L MUT in Figure 1A, left panel). This mutant carries a Y218R <lb/>point mutation, which prevents the CD95L protein from binding to CD95 (Schneider et al., <lb/>1997), and is expressed at a similar level to wild type (wt) CD95L (Figure 1B). To prevent the <lb/>CD95L mRNA from producing full-length CD95L protein, we also introduced a premature stop <lb/>codon right after the start codon in the CD95L MUT vector (CD95L MUT NP). This construct <lb/>(containing 4 point mutations and confirmed to produce mRNA with no detectable full-length <lb/>CD95L protein, Figure 1B) was equally active in reducing the growth of HeyA8 cells when <lb/>compared to the CD95L MUT vector (Figure 1A, left panel). This result suggested that the CD95L <lb/>mRNA could be toxic to HeyA8 cells without the CD95L protein inducing apoptosis. This was <lb/>confirmed by expressing the three CD95L constructs in the presence of the oligo-caspase <lb/>inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Figure 1A, center panel). With suppressed apoptosis, all three constructs <lb/>were now equally toxic to HeyA8 cells. Finally, we tested a HeyA8 CD95 k.o. clone confirmed <lb/>to express no CD95 protein (Putzbach et al., 2017). In these cells, without the addition of zVAD-<lb/>fmk, wt CD95L and CD95L MUT NP were again equally active in severely reducing the growth of <lb/>the cells (Figure 1A, right panel). Together, these data suggested it is the CD95L mRNA that <lb/>killed the cells. Cell death was confirmed by quantifying nuclear fragmentation (Figure 1C). We <lb/>also detected a significant increase of ROS in cells expressing CD95L MUT NP (Figure 1D), which <lb/>is a characteristic feature of DISE (Hadji et al., 2014; Patel &amp; Peter, 2017). To exclude the <lb/>possibility that truncated CD95 protein or any part of the CD95 mRNA would play a role in this <lb/>toxicity, we deleted the CD95 gene in MCF-7 cells (Figure 1 -figure supplement 1A-E). <lb/>Overexpression of wild-type CD95L killed clone FA4 cells, which harbor a complete <lb/>homozygous deletion of the entire CD95 gene, as well as CD95 protein k.o. clone #21 cells that <lb/>retain some truncated mRNA expression (Figure 1E). To further distinguish the activities of the <lb/>CD95L mRNA from CD95L protein, we generated a CD95L expression construct in which we <lb/>introduced 308 (out of 846 nucleotides) silent mutations (CD95L SIL) (Figure 1 -figure <lb/>supplement 2A). The activity of this mutant construct to negatively affect cell growth of CD95 <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>k.o. HeyA8 cells was compared to two independently cloned wt CD95L constructs (WT1 and <lb/>WT2 in Figure 1 -figure supplement 2B). The mutant SIL construct was equally effective in <lb/>suppressing cell growth and produced about the same amount of CD95L mRNA (Figure 1 -<lb/>figure supplement 2C). However, the SIL construct only produced about 12 % of WT CD95L <lb/>protein (Figure 1 -figure supplement 2C), again supporting the observation that it is the CD95L <lb/>RNA and not the protein that elicits toxicity. <lb/>CD95L mRNA kills cells through DISE. <lb/>After infection with CD95L, CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells exhibited morphological changes strikingly <lb/>similar to the changes seen in wt HeyA8 cells after introduction of a CD95L-derived shRNA <lb/>(shL3) (Figure 2A, Video 1-4) suggesting the cells died through a similar mechanism. To <lb/>determine the cause of cell death induced by CD95L mRNA in HeyA8 CD95 k.o. cells <lb/>molecularly, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis. We found that expression of CD95L caused <lb/>preferential downregulation of critical survival genes and not of nonsurvival genes in a control <lb/>set (Figure 2B). In addition, cell death induced by CD95L mRNA resulted in a substantial loss <lb/>of 11 of the 12 histones detected to be downregulated in cells treated with CD95 and CD95L-<lb/>derived sh/siRNAs (Figure 2C). Loss of histons is an early event during DISE (Putzbach et al., <lb/>2017). A Metascape analysis demonstrated that nucleosome assembly, regulation of mitosis, and <lb/>genes consistent with the involvement of histones were among the most significantly <lb/>downregulated RNAs across all cells in which DISE was induced by any of the four sh/siRNAs <lb/>or by the expression of CD95L mRNA (Figure 2D). This suggests that CD95L mRNA kills cells <lb/>in the same way as CD95/L-derived si/shRNAs. <lb/>CD95L mRNA kills cells through RNAi <lb/>Given our previous work on CD95L-derived si/shRNA toxicity, we hypothesized that CD95L <lb/>mRNA kills cells through an RNAi-based mechanism-perhaps by being processed into small <lb/>RNAs that incorporate into the RISC. Drosha k.o. cells lacking the majority of endogenous <lb/>miRNAs, but retaining expression of Ago proteins, were shown to be hypersensitive to DISE <lb/>induced by si-and shRNAs (Putzbach et al., 2017). We interpreted this effect as being caused by <lb/>an increased pool of unoccupied RNAi machinery caused by the absence of most miRNAs. <lb/>Drosha k.o. cells were also hypersensitive to the expression of CD95L MUT NP (Figure 3A, <lb/>p=0.014, according to a polynomial fitting model); Virtually all cells died (insert in Figure 3A). <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>To directly determine whether the RISC is involved in the toxicity, we introduced CD95L into <lb/>CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells after knocking down AGO2 (Figure 3B). Knock down of AGO2 was <lb/>efficient (insert in Figure 3B). Toxicity elicited by CD95L was severely blunted following <lb/>AGO2 knockdown, suggesting that AGO2 was required for CD95L mRNA to be toxic. <lb/>To test the hypothesis that Drosha k.o. cells were more sensitive because their RISC was not <lb/>occupied by large amounts of nontoxic miRNAs and to determine whether CD95L mRNA could <lb/>give rise to small RNAs that incorporate into the RISC, we pulled down AGO1-4-associated <lb/>RNAs and analyzed their composition in wt and Drosha k.o. cells after expressing the <lb/>CD95L MUT NP mRNA. For the pull-down, we used a peptide-derived from the AGO-binding <lb/>partner GW182-recently described to bind to all four Ago proteins (Hauptmann et al., 2015). <lb/>As expected in wt HCT116 cells, large amounts of small RNAs (19-23nt in length) were detected <lb/>bound to the Ago proteins (Figure 3C). Both AGO1 and AGO2 were efficiently pulled down. In <lb/>contrast, in the Drosha k.o. cells, which cannot generate canonical miRNAs, only a low amount <lb/>of small RNAs was detected, confirming the absence of miRNAs in the RISC. Surprisingly, the <lb/>amount of pulled down Ago proteins was severely reduced despite the fact these Drosha k.o. <lb/>cells express comparable levels of AGO2 (Putzbach et al., 2017). This suggests the peptide did <lb/>not have access to the Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells, presumably because it only binds to Ago <lb/>proteins complexed with RNA as recently shown (Elkayam et al., 2017). <lb/>The analysis of all Ago-bound RNAs showed that in the wt cells, &gt;98.4% of bound RNAs <lb/>were miRNAs. In contrast, only 34% of bound RNAs were miRNAs in Drosha k.o. cells (Figure <lb/>3D and data not shown). These include miRNAs that are processed independently of Drosha <lb/>such as miR-320a (Kim, Kim, &amp; Kim, 2016). Consistently, this miRNA became a major RNA <lb/>species bound to Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells (Figure 3D). In both wt and Drosha k.o. cells, <lb/>a significant increase in CD95L-derived small RNAs bound to the Ago proteins was detected <lb/>compared to cells infected with pLenti empty vector. They corresponded to 0.0006% and 0.043% <lb/>of all the Ago-bound RNAs in the wt cells and Drosha k.o. cells, respectively. Toxicity of <lb/>CD95L mRNA was, therefore, not due to overloading the RISC. In the absence of most <lb/>miRNAs, the total amount of RNAs bound to Ago proteins in the Drosha k.o. cells was roughly <lb/>10% of the amount bound to Ago in wt cells (Figure 3D). The reduction of Ago-bound miRNAs <lb/>in Drosha k.o. cells (Figure 3E, top row) was paralleled by a substantial increase in binding of <lb/>other small RNAs to the Ago proteins (Figure 3E, bottom row). Interestingly, the amount of <lb/>Ago-bound CD95L-derived small RNAs was &gt;100 times higher in the Drosha k.o. cells <lb/></body>

			<body>compared to the wt cells (red columns in Figure 3E). These data support our hypothesis that <lb/>Drosha k.o. cells are more sensitive to CD95L mRNA-mediated toxicity due to their ability to <lb/>take up more toxic small CD95L-derived RNAs into the RISC in the absence of most miRNAs. <lb/>CD95L ORF is degraded into small RNA fragments that are then loaded into the RISC. <lb/>Interestingly, not only did Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells bind much more CD95L-derived <lb/>small RNAs than in the wt cells, but also the peak length of the most abundant Ago-bound RNA <lb/>species increased from 20 to 23 nt (Figure 4A, top panel). To determine the sites within the <lb/>CD95L mRNA that gave rise to small Ago-bound RNAs, we aligned all small Ago-bound RNAs <lb/>detected in all conditions to the CD95L ORF sequence (Figure 4B and C). We identified 22 <lb/>regions in the CD95L ORF that gave rise to small RNAs that could be bound by Ago proteins <lb/>(Figure 4B). To determine whether these small RNAs were formed in the cytosol and then <lb/>loaded into the RISC, we also aligned all small RNAs in the total RNA fraction isolated from <lb/>CD95L MUT NP expressing HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells with CD95L (Figure 4C). Interestingly, <lb/>very similar regions of small RNAs were found. Moreover, the mean as well as the peak of the <lb/>distribution of the read lengths of small RNAs bound to Ago proteins was smaller than in the <lb/>total small RNAs fraction (Figure 4A, center panel), suggesting these fragments were trimmed <lb/>to the appropriate length either right before they are loaded into the RISC or by the RISC itself. <lb/>This was most obvious for the small RNAs in cluster 3 (Figure 4B and C). We also noticed that <lb/>certain small RNAs were more abundant in the Ago-bound fraction when compared to total RNA <lb/>relative to all other RNAs. To determine whether this type of processing was specific for <lb/>HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells, we analyzed the Ago-bound small CD95L-derived RNAs in HeyA8 <lb/>CD95 k.o. cells after expression of wt CD95L (Figure 4D) and compared them with the total <lb/>RNA fraction (Figure 4E). While we found fewer CD95L-derived reads in these cells, the <lb/>general location of some of the read clusters overlapped with the ones found in the Drosha k.o. <lb/>cells and again both the mean and peak of the distribution of RNA lengths was smaller in the <lb/>Ago-bound fraction versus the total RNA fraction (Figure 4A, bottom panel). Together, these <lb/>data suggest that CD95L mRNA can be processed into smaller RNA fragments, which are then <lb/>trimmed to a length appropriate for incorporation into the RISC. <lb/>Our data suggest that the CD95L mRNA, when overexpressed, is toxic to cells due to the <lb/>formation of Ago-bound small RNAs that are incorporated into the RISC and kill cells through <lb/>RNAi. This process is independent of Drosha. To determine whether Dicer is required for either <lb/></body>

			<body>processing of CD95L mRNA or loading the small RNAs into the RISC, we expressed <lb/>CD95L MUT NP in wt and Dicer k.o. HCT116 cells (Figure 4F). Dicer k.o. cells were still <lb/>sensitive to toxicity induced by CD95L mRNA expression, suggesting the toxicity of the CD95L <lb/>mRNA does not require the processing by either Drosha or Dicer. Using custom real-time qPCR <lb/>primers designed to specifically detect the small RNAs from clusters 8 and 21, we detected, in <lb/>both wt and Dicer k.o. cells over-expressing CD95L MUT NP, fragments from these clusters <lb/>(Figure 4G), demonstrating that Dicer is not involved in processing CD95L mRNA. <lb/>All the reported small RNAs derived from CD95L corresponded to the sense strand of the <lb/>expressed mRNA, raising the question of how they could be processed into double-stranded <lb/>siRNAs in the absence of an antisense strand. To get a preliminary answer to this question, we <lb/>subjected the CD95L ORF mRNA sequence to a secondary structure prediction (Figure 4 -<lb/>figure supplement 1A). According to this analysis, the CD95L ORF mRNA forms a tightly <lb/>folded structure with many of the small RNAs of the 22 clusters juxtaposing each other in stem-<lb/>like structures creating regions of significant complementarity. These may provide the duplexes <lb/>needed to be processed and loaded into the RISC. Interestingly, many of the juxtaposing reads <lb/>were found in duplex structures with 3&apos; overhangs. Three of these oligonucleotides (derived from <lb/>clusters 7, 15 and 22) when expressed as siRNAs were toxic to HeyA8, H460, M565 and 3LL <lb/>cells (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1B). <lb/>In summary, our data suggest that si-and/or shRNAs with certain seed sequences as they are <lb/>present in CD95 and CD95L and the entire CD95L ORF are toxic to cancer cells. The CD95L <lb/>mRNA is broken down into small RNA-active fragments that are loaded into the RISC and then <lb/>target critical survival genes. This results in cell death through 6mer seed toxicity. The process is <lb/>independent of both Drosha and Dicer. Finally, the data suggest that a high miRNA content, by <lb/>&quot;filling up&quot; the RISC, might render cells less sensitive to this form of cell death. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We recently reported a novel form of cell death that was observed after expression of si/shRNAs <lb/>designed from the sequences of CD95/CD95L mRNA (Putzbach et al., 2017). More recently we <lb/>described that cells die from a loss of multiple survival genes through a mechanism we call 6mer <lb/>seed toxicity (Gao et al., 2018). The most toxic si/shRNAs derived from CD95 or CD95L were <lb/>found in the ORF of CD95L (Putzbach et al., 2017). This pointed toward the CD95L mRNA, <lb/>itself being toxic. <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>We now show that expression of full-length CD95L mRNA triggers toxicity that is <lb/>independent of the protein product and canonical apoptosis. This is intriguing considering <lb/>previous studies showed transgenic expression of CD95L using viruses killed multiple cancer <lb/>cells that were completely resistant to CD95 mediated apoptosis after addition of agonist anti-<lb/>CD95 antibodies (ElOjeimy et al., 2006; Hyer, Voelkel-Johnson, Rubinchik, Dong, &amp; Norris, <lb/>2000; Sudarshan et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012). These results were interpreted as intracellular <lb/>CD95L triggering apoptosis. However, we now provide an alternate explanation-namely, both <lb/>the CD95L protein and mRNA are toxic to cells through distinct mechanisms. The protein <lb/>induces apoptosis, and the mRNA induces toxicity through an RNAi-based mechanism. <lb/>We demonstrate that Dicer and Drosha are not involved in generating the Ago-bound <lb/>CD95L-derived fragments but there are several candidate RNases that are capable of processing <lb/>mRNAs. Given the differences in length distribution between the cytosolic versus Ago-bound <lb/>RNA fragments, it is likely the released CD95L-derived fragment intermediates are incorporated <lb/>into the RISC and then trimmed to the appropriate length by Ago. Indeed, a similar mechanism is <lb/>known to occur during the maturation of the erythropoietic miR-451, where the pre-miRNA is <lb/>first cleaved by AGO2 and then trimmed at the 3&apos; end to the final mature form by the <lb/>exoribonuclease PARN (Yoda et al., 2013). Furthermore, a similar process occurs with the <lb/>recently identified class of Ago-bound RNAs called agotrons (Hansen et al., 2016), which <lb/>consist of an excised intron loaded into the RISC in a manner independent of Drosha or Dicer <lb/>pre-processing. After trimmed to the appropriate size, the guide RNAs in complex with the RISC <lb/>can regulate gene expression through RNAi. <lb/>Our data provide the first evidence of an overexpressed cDNA to be toxic via an RNAi-<lb/>dependent mechanism. It was first shown in plants that overexpressed transgenes can be <lb/>converted into RNAi active short RNA sequences (Hamilton &amp; Baulcombe, 1999). Our data on <lb/>the effects of overexpressed CD95L RNA, while mechanistically distinct from what was <lb/>reported in plants, maybe the first example of transgene determining cell fate through the RNAi <lb/>mechanism in mammalian cells. <lb/>A major question that arises from our data is whether CD95L mRNA is toxic in vivo. We and <lb/>others have noticed upregulation of CD95L in multiple stress-related conditions such as after <lb/>treatment with chemotherapy ((Friesen, Fulda, &amp; Debatin, 1999) and data not shown). While the <lb/>amount of CD95L mRNA and the level of upregulation alone may not be enough to be toxic, it <lb/>could be the combination of multiple RNA fragments, derived from multiple different mRNAs <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>that are generated to kill cells (Putzbach et al., 2018). We view CD95L as just one of many <lb/>RNAs that have this activity. Indeed, it is unlikely CD95L is the only gene whose mRNA is toxic <lb/>to cells, as this mRNA-based level of toxicity would be redundant with the potent killing <lb/>capacity of the CD95L protein. Also, upregulating an mRNA that, by itself, could decimate the <lb/>cells that would otherwise need to upregulate that mRNA to carry out their biological function in <lb/>the first place, such as activated T cells upregulating CD95L to mount an immune response, <lb/>would be self-defeating. Therefore, nature likely distributed this mRNA-based toxicity-inducing <lb/>capacity over many genes in the genome to prevent activating it when any one of those genes is <lb/>upregulated during specific cellular processes. It is more likely there exists an entire network of <lb/>these genes that can release toxic small RNAs when the appropriate stimulus is encountered. <lb/>Consistent with this hypothesis we recently identified other genes that contain sequences that <lb/>when converted to shRNAs kill cancer cells through 6mer seed toxicity (Patel &amp; Peter, 2017). <lb/>Future work will be aimed at identifying additional genes and the mechanism through which they <lb/>are processed and under what conditions to kill cells. <lb/></body>

All cell lines <lb/>were authenticated using STR profiling and tested monthly for mycoplasm using PlasmoTest <lb/>(Invitrogen). <lb/>Plasmids and constructs <lb/>The pLenti-CD95L was synthesized by sub-cloning an insert containing the CD95L ORF <lb/>(NM_000639.2; synthesized by IDT as minigene with flanking 5&apos; NheI RE site and 3&apos; XhoI RE <lb/>sites in pIDTblue vector) into the pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector (ABM Inc). The insert <lb/>and the backbone were digested with NheI (NEB #R0131) and XhoI (NEB #R0146) restriction <lb/>enzymes. Subsequent ligation with T4 DNA ligase created the pLenti-CD95L vector. The <lb/>pLenti-CD95L MUT vector was created by sub-cloning a CD95L cDNA insert with 2 nucleotide <lb/>substitutions in codon 218 (TAT -&gt; CGT) resulting in replacement of tyrosine for arginine, which <lb/>has been described to inhibit binding to CD95 (Schneider et al., 1997) into the pLenti-GIII-<lb/>CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector. The pLenti-CD95L MUT NP vector was created by inserting a CD95L <lb/>ORF cDNA sequence containing both the Y218R mutation and a single nucleotide substitution at <lb/>the second codon (CAG -&gt; TAG), resulting in a premature stop codon right after the start codon, <lb/>into the pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector. The pLenti-CD95L SIL was created by sub-<lb/>cloning a mutant CD95L ORF cDNA sequence with codons synonymously mutated (Figure 1 -<lb/>figure supplement 2A ) to the next most highly utilized codon in human cells (exceptions were <lb/>made within the proline rich domain to meet gene synthesis design criteria.) into the pLenti-GIII-<lb/>CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector. <lb/>Overexpression of CD95L cDNAs <lb/></body>

Infection with <lb/>empty pLenti was always included as a control. <lb/>To assess toxicity of overexpressing CD95L cDNAs, cells infected with these constructs <lb/>were plated in on a 96-well plate 1 day after selection in the presence of puromycin (uninfected <lb/>cells were all dead after 1 day in presence of puromycin); Cell confluency was assessed over <lb/>time using the IncuCyte as described previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). <lb/>To assess overexpression of CD95L cDNAs in apoptosis-sensitive HeyA8 cells in Figure <lb/>1A, infection with CD95L lentiviruses were done in 96-well plate using 50 µl of virus in the <lb/>presence of 20 µM zVAD-fmk (Sigma-Aldrich #V116) and 8 μg/ml Polybrene; media was <lb/>changed next day in the presence of 20 µM zVAD-fmk; 3 μg/ml puromycin was added the <lb/>following day. Infection with the CD95L constructs for the RT-qPCR and Western blot in <lb/>Figure 1B were done in a 6-well plate in the presence of 20 µM zVAD-fmk. <lb/>For the experiment in Figure 3B, HeyA8 CD95 knock-out cells were reverse transfected <lb/>in a 6-well plate; 100,000 cells were plated in wells with either the On-TargetPlus non-targeting <lb/>siRNA (Dharmacon #D-001810-10) or siAGO2 pool (Dharmacon ##L-004639-00-0005) at 25 <lb/>nM complexed with 1 µl RNAiMax. After ~24 hrs, the cells were infected with either pLenti or <lb/>pLenti-CD95L (500 μl of viral supernatant [25% of total volume]). Next day, media was <lb/>replaced, and cells were expanded to 10 cm plates. The following day, 3 μg/ml puromycin <lb/>was added. When puromycin selection was complete (one day later), the 750-1,500 cells were <lb/>plated per well in a 96-well plate and put in the IncuCyte machine to assess cell confluency over <lb/>time. <lb/></body>

			<body>CRISPR deletions <lb/>We co-transfected a Cas9-expressing plasmid (Jinek et al., 2013) and two gRNAs that target <lb/>upstream and downstream to delete an entire section of DNA as described previously (Putzbach <lb/>et al., 2017). The gRNA scaffold was used as described (Mali et al., 2013). The gRNAs were <lb/>designed using the algorithm found at http://crispr.mit.edu; only gRNAs with a score above 50 <lb/>were considered. <lb/>A deletion of 227 nucleotides in exon 4 of CD95 in MCF-7 cells (ΔshR6, clone #21) was <lb/>generated using gRNAs described previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). Deletion of this site results <lb/>in a frame-shift mutation that causes a protein-level knock-out (Putzbach et al., 2017). PCR with <lb/>flanking external primers (Fr: 5&apos;-GGTGTCATGCTGTGACTGTTG-3&apos; and Rev: 5&apos;-<lb/>TTTAGCTTAAGTGGCCAGCAA-3&apos;) and internal primers (Fr primer and the internal Rev primer <lb/>5&apos;-AAGTTGGTTTACATCTGCAC-3&apos;) was used to screen for single cell clones that harbor a <lb/>homozygous deletion. <lb/>The two sequences targeted by the flanking gRNAs for the deletion of the entire CD95 gene <lb/>were 5&apos;-GTCAGGGTTCGTTGCACAAA-3&apos; and 5&apos;-TGCTTCTTGGATCCCTTAGA-3&apos;. For <lb/>detection of the CD95 gene deletion, the flanking external primers were 5&apos;-<lb/>TGTTTAATATAGCTGGGGCTATGC-3&apos; <lb/>(Fr <lb/>primer) <lb/>and <lb/>5&apos;-<lb/>TGGGACTCATGGGTTAAATAGAAT-3&apos; (Rev primer), and the internal reverse primer was 5&apos;-<lb/>GACCAGTCTTCTCATTTCAGAGGT-3&apos;. After screening the clones, Sanger sequencing was <lb/>performed to confirm the proper deletion had occurred. <lb/>Real-Time quantitative PCR <lb/>The relative expression of specific mRNAs was quantified as described previously (Gao et al., <lb/>2018). The primer/probes purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific were GAPDH <lb/>(Hs00266705_g1), human CD95L (Hs00181226_g1 and Hs00181225_m1), human CD95 <lb/>(Hs00531110_m1 and Hs00236330_m1), and a custom primer/probe to detect the CD95L SIL <lb/>mRNA (designed using the Thermofisher Scientific custom design tool; assay ID: APNKTUD). <lb/>Custom RT-qPCR probes designed to specifically detect small RNA species were used to <lb/>detect CD95L fragments in Figure 4G. These probes were designed using ThermoFisher&apos;s <lb/>Custom TaqMan Small RNA Assay Design Tool (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/custom-<lb/>genomic-products/tools/small-rna/) <lb/>to <lb/>target <lb/>the <lb/>cluster <lb/>8 <lb/>sequence <lb/>(5&apos;-<lb/>AAGGAGCTGGCAGAACTCCGAGA-3&apos;) <lb/>and <lb/>the <lb/>cluster <lb/>21 <lb/>sequence <lb/>(5&apos;-<lb/></body>

			<body>TCAACGTATCTGAGCTCTCTC-3&apos;). Detection of these fragments involves a two-step <lb/>amplification protocol used to detect microRNAs. In the first step, the High-Capacity cDNA <lb/>reverse transcription kit is used to selectively reverse transcribe the two clusters to be quantified <lb/>using specific primers and 20 nM RNA input following the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. The cDNA <lb/>is diluted 1:5. The qPCR reaction mixture is composed of the diluted cDNA, the custom probes, <lb/>and the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems #43240018). Reactions were <lb/>performed in triplicate. Ct values were determined using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real <lb/>Time PCR system with a thermocycle profile of 50°C for two min (step one), 95°C for 10 min <lb/>(step two), and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s (step three) and 60°C for 1 min (step four). The <lb/>ΔΔCt values between the small RNA of interest and the control were calculated to determine <lb/>relative abundance of the small RNA. Samples were normalized to Z30 (ThermoFisher Scientific <lb/>#4427975). <lb/>Western blot analysis <lb/>Detection of human CD95, CD95L and Ago proteins was done via Western blot as described <lb/>previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). <lb/>CD95 surface staining <lb/>Flow cytometry was used to quantify the level of membrane-localized CD95 as described <lb/>previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). <lb/>Cell death quantification (DNA fragmentation) and ROS production <lb/>The percent of subG1 nuclei (fragmented DNA) was determined by PI staining/flow cytometry <lb/>as described previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). ROS production was quantified using the cell-<lb/>permeable indicator 2&apos;,7&apos;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (ThermoFisher Scientific #D399) <lb/>as previously described (Hadji et al., 2014). <lb/>Assessing cell growth and fluorescence over time <lb/>After treatment/infection, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at least in triplicate. Images were <lb/>captured at indicated time points using an IncuCyte ZOOM live cell imaging system (Essen <lb/>BioScience) with a 10x objective lens. Percent confluence and total fluorescent integrated <lb/>intensity was calculated using the IncuCyte ZOOM software (version 2015A). <lb/></body>

			<body>Infection of cells for Ago-pull down and small RNA-Seq analysis <lb/>HeyA8 ΔshR6 clone #11 cells were seeded at 75,000 cells per well on 6-well plates, and the <lb/>HCT116 and HCT116 Drosha knock-out cells were both seeded at 500,000 per well on 6-well <lb/>plates. The HeyA8 ΔshR6 clone #11 cells were infected with 0.5 mL of empty pLenti or pLenti-<lb/>CD95L-WT viral supernatant per well. The HCT116 and HCT116 Drosha knockout cells were <lb/>infected with 0.5 mL empty pLenti or pLenti-CD95L MUT NP viral supernatant per well. Media <lb/>was changed the next day and the cells were pooled and expanded to multiple 15 cm dishes. <lb/>Selection with 3 µg/mL puromycin began the following day. The next day, the HeyA8 ΔshR6 <lb/>clone #11 infected cells were seeded at 600,000 cells per dish in multiple 15 cm dishes; the <lb/>HCT116 and HCT116 Drosha knock-out cells were seeded at 5 million cells per dish in multiple <lb/>15 cm dishes. Two days later, each of the samples was pelleted and split in two: one pellet was <lb/>lysed and processed for small RNA sequencing, and the other pellet was flash frozen in liquid <lb/>nitrogen. The pellets were stored at -80°C until they could be used for the Ago pull-down <lb/>experiment. The purpose of splitting the sample was so that we could compare the total cellular <lb/>pool of small RNAs to the fraction that was bound to the RISC. This way, the processing <lb/>CD95L-derived fragments from the full-length mRNA in the cytosol to the final mature RISC-<lb/>bound form could be mapped. This was all done in duplicate. <lb/>RNA-Seq analysis <lb/>Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74004) following the <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions. An on-column digestion step using the RNase-free DNase Set <lb/>(Qiagen #79254) was included. Both small and large mRNA libraries were generated and <lb/>sequenced as described previously (Putzbach et al., 2017). Reads were trimmed with TrimGalore <lb/>and then aligned to the hg38 assembly of the human genome with Tophat. Raw read counts were <lb/>assigned to genes using HTSeq and differential gene expression was analyzed with the R <lb/>Bioconductor EdgeR package (Robinson, McCarthy, &amp; Smyth, 2010). <lb/>Ago pull down and RNA-Seq analysis of bound small RNAs <lb/>Cell pellets were harvest at 50 hours after plating (122 hours after infection) and were flash <lb/>frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were stored at -80°C until ready for further processing. <lb/>Between 10 and 25 x 10 6 cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM <lb/></body>

			<body>NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) NP40, supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors) on ice for 15 <lb/>minutes. The lysate was sonicated 3 times for 30 s at 60% amplitude (Sonics, VCX130) and <lb/>cleared by centrifugation at 12,000g for 20 minutes. AGO1-4 were pulled down by using 500 µg <lb/>of Flag-GST-T6B peptide (Hauptmann et al., 2015) and with 60 µl anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads <lb/>(Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hrs at 4°C. The pull-down was washed 3 times in NP40 lysis buffer. <lb/>During the last wash, 10% of beads were removed and incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes in 2x <lb/>SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were run on a 4-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to <lb/>nitrocellulose membrane. The pull-down efficiency was determined by immunoblotting against <lb/>AGO1 (Cell Signaling #5053; RRID:AB_10695871 and Abcam #98056; RRID:AB_10680548) <lb/>and AGO2 (Abcam #32381; RRID:AB_867543). To the remaining beads 500 µl TRIzol reagent <lb/>were added and the RNA extracted according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. The RNA pellet <lb/>was diluted in 20 µl of water. The sample was split, and half of the sample was dephosphorylated <lb/>with 0.5 U/µl of CIP alkaline phosphatase at 37°C for 15 min and subsequently radiolabeled with <lb/>0.5 µCi γ-32 P-ATP and 1 U/µl of T4 PNK kinase for 20 min at 37°C. The AGO1-4 interacting <lb/>RNAs were visualized on a 15% urea-PAGE. The remaining RNA was taken through a small <lb/>RNA library preparation as previously described (Hafner et al., 2012). Briefly, RNA was ligated <lb/>with 3&apos; adenylated adapters and separated on a 15% denaturing urea-PAGE. The RNA <lb/>corresponding to insert size of 19-35 nt was eluted from the gel, ethanol precipitated followed by <lb/>5&apos; adapter ligation. The samples were separated on a 12% Urea-PAGE and extracted from the <lb/>gel. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and the <lb/>cDNA amplified by PCR. The cDNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 3000. Adapter <lb/>sequences: Adapter 1 -NNTGACTGTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG; Adapter 2 -<lb/>NNACACTCTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>3 <lb/>-<lb/>NNACAGAGTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>4 <lb/>-<lb/>NNGCGATATGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>47 <lb/>-<lb/>NNTCTGTGTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>48 <lb/>-<lb/>NNCAGCATTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>49 <lb/>-<lb/>NNATAGTATGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG, <lb/>Adapter <lb/>50 <lb/>-<lb/>NNTCATAGTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG. <lb/>RT <lb/>primer <lb/>sequence: <lb/>GCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA; <lb/>PCR <lb/>primer <lb/>sequences: <lb/>CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGTGATGTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAG <lb/>AATTCCA. To identify CD95L-derived small RNAs among the sequenced reads, a BLAST <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>database was generated from each set of reads, and blastn was used to query the CD95L ORF <lb/>(derived from NM_000639.2) against reads from cells infected with pLenti-CD95L and to query <lb/>the CD95L MUT NP ORF sequence against reads from cells infected with CD95L MUT NP. The only <lb/>reads considered further were those matching a CD95L sequence with an e-value of less than <lb/>0.05 and 100% identity across the entire length of the read. This resulted in the loss of a few <lb/>reads less than 19/20 nt in length. The filtered BLAST hits were converted to a bed formatted <lb/>file, describing the locations of reads relative to the relevant CD95L sequence, and the R <lb/>package Sushi was used to plot the bed files and generate Figures 4B-E. <lb/>Assessing toxicity of CD95L-derived small RNAs <lb/>To determine whether guide RNAs derived from the over-expressed CD95L mRNA could evoke <lb/>toxicity, the small CD95L-derived RNA reads (corresponding to different clusters shown in <lb/>Figure 4C) bound to AGO from the HCT116 Drosha knock-out cells were converted to siRNAs. <lb/>First, all reads less than 18 nucleotides were filtered out, as these do not efficiently incorporate <lb/>into the RISC. siRNAs were designed with antisense strands identical to these CD95L-derived <lb/>sequences that mapped to areas of the CD95L mRNA secondary structure (Figure 4 -figure <lb/>supplement 1A) that are predicted to form duplexes. These sequences were designed as 19 <lb/>nucleotide oligos with a 3&apos; deoxy AA. The complementary sense strand was designed with a 3&apos; <lb/>deoxy TT and 2&apos;-O-methylation at the first two positions to prevent its incorporation into the <lb/>RISC. These oligos were ordered from IDT and annealed to form the final siRNAs. The <lb/>sequences of the antisense strands (corresponding to the CD95L mRNA-derived cluster <lb/>fragments) were as follows: 5&apos;-AUUGGGCCUGGGGAUGUUU-3&apos; (c7/1), 5&apos;-<lb/>CCUGGGGAUGUUUCAGCUC-3&apos; (c7/2), 5&apos;-CCAACUCAAGGUCCAUGCC-3&apos; (c11), 5&apos;-<lb/>AAACUGGGCUGUACUUUGU-3&apos; (c15/1), 5&apos;-AACUGGGCUGUACUUUGUA-3&apos; (c15/2), <lb/>5&apos;-CAACAACCUGCCCCUGAGC-3&apos; (c16/1), 5&apos;-AACUCUAAGCGUCCCCAGG-3&apos; (c16/2), <lb/>5&apos;-UCAACGUAUCUGAGCUCUC-3&apos; (c21), and 5&apos;-AAUCUCAGACGUUUUUCGG-3&apos; <lb/>(c22). <lb/>These eight siRNAs were reverse transfected into HeyA8, H460, M565, and 3LL cells using <lb/>RNAiMAX transfection reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 10 nM in triplicate as previously <lb/>described (Murmann et al., 2018). The non-targeting (NT) and siL3 siRNAs, as described <lb/>previously (Putzbach et al., 2017), were used as a negative and positive control, respectively. <lb/>Cell death was quantified via ATP release 96 hours after transfection using CellTiter-Glo <lb/></body>

			<body>(Promega). The % viability was calculated in relation to the RNAiMAX-only treatment <lb/>structure (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1B). <lb/>Statistical analyses <lb/>Continuous data were summarized as means and standard deviations (except for all IncuCyte <lb/>experiments where standard errors are shown) and dichotomous data as proportions. Continuous <lb/>data were compared using t-tests for two independent groups and one-way ANOVA for 3 or <lb/>more groups. For evaluation of continuous outcomes over time, two-way ANOVA was used with <lb/>one factor for the treatment conditions of primary interest and a second factor for time treated as <lb/>a categorical variable to allow for non-linearity. <lb/>The effects of treatment on wild-type versus Drosha knock-out cells were statistically <lb/>assessed by fitting regression models that included linear and quadratic terms for value over <lb/>time, main effects for treatment and cell type, and two-and three-way interactions for treatment, <lb/>cell-type and time. The three-way interaction on the polynomial terms with treatment and cell <lb/>type was evaluated for statistical significance since this represents the difference in treatment <lb/>effects over the course of the experiment for the varying cell types. <lb/>GSEA used in Figure 2B was performed using the GSEA v2.2.4 software from the Broad <lb/>Institute (www.http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea); 1000 permutations were used. The <lb/>Sabatini gene lists were set as custom gene sets to determine enrichment of survival genes versus <lb/>the nonsurvival control genes in downregulated genes from the RNA-Seq data as done <lb/>previously (Putzbach et al., 2017); p-values below 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. <lb/>Genes with an average normalized read expression (across both pair of duplicates) below 3 were <lb/>excluded so as to only include genes that are truly expressed. The GO enrichment analysis shown <lb/>in Figure 2D was performed with all genes that after alignment and normalization were found to <lb/>be at least 1.5 fold downregulated with an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05 using the software available <lb/>on www.Metascape.org and default running parameters. The other data sets used in this analysis <lb/>(HeyA8 cells transfected with a toxic siRNA targeting CD95L siL3 and 293T infected with toxic <lb/>shRNAs targeting CD95L shL1 and shL3 and HeyA8 cells infected with a toxic shRNA <lb/>targeting CD95 shR6) were previously described (Putzbach et al., 2017). <lb/>All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 14 or R 3.3.1. <lb/></body>

			<body>Predicted secondary structure of CD95L ORF and toxicity of CD95L-derived small <lb/>RNAs after conversion to siRNAs. <lb/>(A) The CD95L MUT NP RNA was subjected to a RNA secondary structure analysis <lb/>(http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at) using default settings. The locations of 22 reads representative of the <lb/>22 read clusters are shown. Regions with potential duplex formation are boxed. The <lb/>oligonucleotides that were found to be toxic when expressed as siRNAs are circled. (B) Toxicity <lb/>of the eight siRNAs designed using the CD95L-derived small RNA fragments bound to Ago as <lb/>the antisense strand sequences 96 hours post-transfection in the indicated cell lines. Each data <lb/>point represents the mean ± SE of three replicates. <lb/></body>
