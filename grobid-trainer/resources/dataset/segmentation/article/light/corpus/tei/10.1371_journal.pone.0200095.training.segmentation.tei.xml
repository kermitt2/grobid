Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipe-<lb/>lines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs <lb/>in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), <lb/>Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes <lb/>(1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large pro-<lb/>portion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible <lb/>occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and <lb/>C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace ele-<lb/>ments. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples <lb/>registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Bats (Order: Chiroptera) are highly diverse and ecologically valuable comprising 25% of living <lb/>mammalian species. The most abundant group of mammals based on the number of individu-<lb/>als, they evolved into an incredibly rich diversity that roost in foliages, caves, rock crevices <lb/>even in man-made structures[1, 2]. They feed on insects, nectar, fruits, seeds, fish, frogs and <lb/>small mammals [3, 4]. <lb/>Bats serve the ecosystem as pollinators, agents of seed dispersal and sources of guano-based <lb/>fertilizers. As biological agents to control pest population, they limit spread of human diseases <lb/>and prevent significant economic losses on crops and livestock [4-7]. Through the production <lb/>of guano, their accumulated excrement, bats are also responsible for nutrient cycling. As the <lb/>main source of energy for a wide range of unique species found on specific caves, guano depos-<lb/>its form the basis of cave ecosystems [7]. The formation of bat guano is an interesting interplay <lb/>among bats as primary producers, the nutrients present in the food they eat and the biological <lb/>and environmental changes inside the cave ecosystem. Guano is noted for its agricultural ben-<lb/>efits as an ideal fertilizer attributed to its richness in carbon, nitrogen, potassium and phospho-<lb/>rus. In the US, Asia, Cuba and South America, guano is being marketed as the best organic <lb/>fertilizer available. In the Philippines, caves in the Bicol Region, Pangasinan and Samal (Davao <lb/>del Norte) are few places that produce abundant guano in high risk of disturbance due to ille-<lb/>gal extraction. According to local government officials, guano-mining is inevitable since it is <lb/>the source of income among the locals and, likewise, a free organic fertilizer for agricultural <lb/>crops within the vicinity of the caves. <lb/>As prey and predator, bats have been implicated in epidemiologic cycles of several emerging <lb/>and re-emerging zoonoses [8] and carriers of pathogenic agents that include more than 200 <lb/>different types of viruses such as rabies [9], Ebola and Marburg viruses [10-12], and Severe <lb/>Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [5, 13, 14]. Fungi like Histoplasma capsula-<lb/>tum [15-18], Geomyces destructans [19] and Pseudogymnoascus destructans [20] were reported <lb/>to be isolated, considered as cause of infection and death in hibernating bats. Although bacte-<lb/>rial colonization has been observed only on samples of rocks, cave wall and/or ceiling paint-<lb/>ings, dripping waters, springs and underwater passages, oligotrophic cave-dwelling microbial <lb/>species have been described as phylogenetically diverse with lineages across the breadth of the <lb/>bacteria. Presence of pathogenic enteric bacteria mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae <lb/>and some bacterial pathogens common in human and animal diseases (e.g. Pasteurella, Salmo-<lb/>nella, Escherichia and Yersinia spp.) [21, 22] was reported to be affected by the foraging habits, <lb/>diet and activities of the bats inside and outside of caves. Other bacterial pathogens (e.g. Barto-<lb/>nella, Borrelia, Leptospira spp., Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, <lb/>Arthrobacter and Micrococcus spp.) provided evidence for novel species that seem to be specific <lb/>for bat hosts with probable medical importance to humans and other animals [23-26]. These <lb/>harmful microorganisms may also contribute to continuous decline of bat population in caves. <lb/>In addition, human-induced environmental stresses such as habitat destruction and fragmen-<lb/>tation, overhunting for bush meat, and increased use of pesticides also have negative impact to <lb/>bat population in caves [4]. Thus a persistent call for global bat conservation is necessary. <lb/>So far, the discovery of novel and potentially pathogenic bacteria and its interaction with <lb/>the environment is limited by culture-based approaches. Culture-independent methods are <lb/>essential to understand the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecological roles of the <lb/>majority of microorganisms [27]. High-throughput screening allows the paradigm shift on <lb/>microbiology and bioinformatics towards modern metagenomics that augment the limitations <lb/>of culture-based methods [28, 29]. Availability and accessibility of cost-effective next-genera-<lb/>tion high-throughput sequencing methods improved understanding of the assembly, evolution <lb/></body>

			<body>and functions of ecological communities. Metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA gene sequenc-<lb/>ing were used to characterize gut and guano microbiome of several bat species [22, 27, 30-32] <lb/>and feces of different animals to determine their diet as well as the diversity of metabolic func-<lb/>tional genes (i.e. enzymes) [33-35]. <lb/>To date, there have been no reports on the bacterial diversity of guano from Philippine <lb/>caves. There is limited local information in terms of benefits and harmful effects as well as eco-<lb/>logical importance. Bacterial diversity of guano may give insights on its potential as source of <lb/>nutrients for plant growth and their impacts on human health. This is the first report on the <lb/>bacterial diversity of bat guano using metagenomics in the Philippines particularly at Caba-<lb/>lyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Sample collection <lb/>Guano samples were collected from two large chambers, Chamber 1 (C1) and Chamber 2 (C2) <lb/>in Cabalyorisa Cave Complex, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines (N16˚00&apos;22.6&quot;E and N1195 <lb/>6&apos;35.2&quot;E, respectively at 100 msl). Prior to sampling, a Wildlife Gratuitous Permit (WGP) <lb/>(2015-002) has been granted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources <lb/>(DENR), La Union, Philippines. The WGP allowed the conduct of field collection for the <lb/>assessment of bat guano community in selected caves in Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines with <lb/>clearances and endorsements of the local government unit. <lb/>The first guano sample, C1, was collected from a chamber located 50 meters from the cave <lb/>entrance. Patches and pool of powdery guano were collected in between rocks, rock crevices <lb/>and on pot holes of the breakdown pile of about 3-4.5 m high and 3-5 m from the ceiling <lb/>using sterile hand trowel. The chamber was about 9 m at its widest and near a pool of water. <lb/>The second sample, C2, was collected 77 m further up near the flyway of bats. It is 6 m at its <lb/>widest with ceiling of 3 to 7 m high [36] and host sizable roost of bats of about 10-100 bat indi-<lb/>viduals. This chamber is an important flyway for bats roosting further in the cave and host <lb/>about 1-10 bat individuals. The floor of the site was uneven, made of large boulders and rock <lb/>formations that holds pool of guano. Guano were collected from seven sites in each chamber, <lb/>pooled and placed inside re-sealable zipper plastic bags using sterile shovel. Composite sam-<lb/>ples were then brought to the laboratory inside an ice chest and subjected to immediate DNA <lb/>extraction and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrophotometric analysis. <lb/>Bat species identification <lb/>Bats were identified through a combination of cave bat survey methods such as live-trapping <lb/>with mist nets, acoustic analysis using a bat detector (Dodotronic Ultranic 250K, Brazil) and <lb/>visual surveys. Six meter long mist nets were placed along the entrance and flyways inside the <lb/>cave. Individual bats were collected and identified by the Zoological and Wildlife Museum of <lb/>the University of the Philippines Los Baños Museum of Natural History (UPLB-MNH) based <lb/>from the guide &quot;Key to the Bats of the Philippine Islands&quot; [37]. Bats were immediately released <lb/>upon identification. No bats were killed in this study. <lb/>Elemental analysis of bat guano <lb/>The elemental compositions of bat guano C1 and C2 were analyzed semi-quantitatively using <lb/>handheld X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (Delta Professional, Olympus, Japan) at the <lb/>Earth Material Science Laboratory of the National Institute of Geological Science, University <lb/>of the Philippines Diliman.

Light elements, Silver (Ag), Cadmium (Cd), Tin (Sn) and Antimony (Sb) <lb/>were removed to normalize the results and reported as semi-quantitative or based on a relative <lb/>composition. <lb/>DNA extraction, amplicon library construction and sequencing <lb/>Total DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Solana Beach, CA, <lb/>USA) and used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with primer set <lb/>341F (5&apos;-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3&apos; and 805R: 5&apos;-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3&apos;) <lb/>targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplifications were performed in a final <lb/>volume of 50 μl containing 10X Taq buffer, dNTP mixture, 10 mM of each primer and 2 U of <lb/>Taq polymerase (ExTaq, Takara, Japan). Cycling conditions in C1000 Touch thermal cycler <lb/>(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were: initial denaturation at 95˚C for 3 min; followed by 25 <lb/>cycles of 95˚C for 30 s, 55˚C for 30 s, 72˚C for 30 s; with final extension at 72˚C for 5 min [38]. <lb/>The PCR products were confirmed using gel electrophoresis and purified using the Agencourt <lb/>AMPure XP Reagents beads (Bechman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Equal amounts of purified <lb/>product were pooled, and final product quality were assessed on a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent, <lb/>Palo Alto, CA, USA) using a DNA 7500 chip. Sequencing was performed by Chunlab Inc. <lb/>(Seoul, Republic of Korea) with Illumina MiSeq 250 paired-end system (Illumina, San Diego, <lb/>CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>Bioinformatic and statistical analyses of C1 and C2 guano <lb/>Data preprocessing and taxonomic classification of C1 and C2 sequence reads were carried <lb/>out in Mothur pipeline [39]. Forward and reverse reads, after primer and barcodes removal, <lb/>were aligned to form one continuous DNA sequence. Sequences that contained ambiguous <lb/>bases less than 430 bp in length, or with homopolymers of greater than 8 bp were discarded. <lb/>Chimeras were identified and removed using UCHIME [40]. SILVA reference database release <lb/>128 [41] was used for sequence alignments and classification. The microbial diversity was ana-<lb/>lyzed using QIIME software [42]. In addition, the upstream analyses of microbial sequences <lb/>through Mothur pipeline were also complemented with QIIME tool. <lb/>Alpha diversity analysis included Shannon index, Simpson, Chao1, and observed number <lb/>of bacterial species. The functional profiles of microbial communities were predicted by the <lb/>software &quot;Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States <lb/>(PICRUSt)&quot; and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Database [43]. The phy-<lb/>loseq, biom, and pheatmap R packages were used for data analysis and plotting. Metagenome <lb/>sequence data of C1 and C2 guano are available at NCBI with accession no. SRP101645. <lb/>Comparative analysis of bat guano microbiome <lb/>C1 and C2 bat guano data were compared with published microbiome profiles retrieved <lb/>from NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archives) in fastq or fasta format [22, 35, 44], according to <lb/>protocol. Briefly, data were quality filtered using Mothur. Good quality sequences, defined as <lb/>sequences having a length of at least 100 bases, contain homopolymers of not more than 5 bp, <lb/>and having zero ambiguity were used for comparison. All the filtered sequences were merged <lb/>into a single fasta file and processed using QIIME pipeline. SILVA123_QIIME_release was <lb/>used as reference to pick OTUs employing a closed reference approach based from different <lb/>studies that utilized different regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Non-bacterial OTUs were <lb/>removed from the dataset. Core OTU was defined as an OTU present in 100% of the samples. <lb/>Correspondence analysis of the samples was done in R using the FactoMineR package [45]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results and discussion <lb/>Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan <lb/>Mabini is a third-class municipality located in the Western district of the Province of Pangasi-<lb/>nan, Philippines. Mabini, named after the sublime paralytic Philippine hero, was once part of <lb/>the Province of Zambales and formerly known as Balincaguin or &quot;Bali lan Caguin&quot;, a Zambal <lb/>phrase which translates to &quot;Abode of Bats&quot; [46]. The municipality lies at about 15˚55&apos;00&quot; and <lb/>16˚52&apos;00&quot; longitudes and about 119˚56&apos;00&quot; and 120˚04&apos;00&quot; latitudinal lines and bounded on <lb/>the north by the City of Alaminos and town of Sual, on the northwest by the municipalities of <lb/>Agno and Burgos and on the southwest by the municipality of Dasol [36, 46]. The town was <lb/>formerly named Balincaguin because of its numerous karstic and limestone caves that include <lb/>Cacupangan Cave, Binmatya Cave, Ara-saas and Santo Rosario Caves, and Tinmori Tower <lb/>Karst [47] which serve as roosting sites for various species of bats. <lb/>Bat guano <lb/>A combination of several approaches on bat survey, namely, live-trapping with mist nets, <lb/>acoustic monitoring using bat detector and visual surveys, were used. Bats inside Cabalyorisa <lb/>Cave were mainly insectivorous and identified as Miniopterus australis, little long-fingered bat <lb/>or little bent-winged bat; M. schreibersii, a common bent wing bat and Rhinolophus amplixe-<lb/>dectus, the horse shoe bat. Encinares (2016) documented that aside from macroarthropods, <lb/>microarthropods observed included isotomid, sminthurid and an unidentified springtail, Geo-<lb/>laelaps, Oplitis, Deraiophorus, two uropodids and one oribatd mite, and an unidentified brown <lb/>ant. Presence of these microarthropods confirmed the insect-feeding nature of the bats roost-<lb/>ing in Cabalyorisa Cave [36]. <lb/>XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 samples revealed significant differences in <lb/>the composition of both the major and trace elements (Table 1). C1 guano had high levels of <lb/>Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples yielded high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn <lb/>and Cr.

			<body>deposited on the ground or on rock crevices. Decomposition of bat guano is affected by vari-<lb/>ous physical and environmental factors [22] and the dynamic nature of the microorganism <lb/>present. The conversion of organic and inorganic matters by the microorganism present, in <lb/>turn, results in the change of pH due to the release of ammonia. Thus, the resulting high levels <lb/>of nutritional contents from major and trace elements are vital components of organic and <lb/>inorganic compounds used in biosynthesis and energy production supporting the growth and <lb/>diversification of guano-borne bacteria [48]. Sequentially, high nutrient levels of guano pro-<lb/>mote the growth of diverse groups of microorganisms. <lb/>Richness and diversity analysis of bacterial community composition from <lb/>two guano samples <lb/>A total of 220,152 and 169,161 reads were obtained from C1 and C2, respectively. After contig <lb/>assembly, trimming, and chimera removal, a total of 104,764 and 87,379 valid reads were <lb/>obtained for C1 and C2, respectively. Valid reads for C1 were assigned to 12,435 OTUs, while <lb/>valid reads for C2 were assigned to 5,408 OTUs. <lb/>Rarefaction was done to a maximum depth of 85,000 counts per sample and 10 replicates <lb/>per iteration. The results of the Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1 indices, and the number of <lb/>observed species are show apparent variations between the two samples (Fig 1). Analysis of <lb/>within-sample alpha diversity suggests that the bacterial community of C1 and C2 samples <lb/>exhibited high biodiversity in all tested metrics, with C1 being more diverse than C2. Compari-<lb/>son of observed species and Chao1 diversity indices suggest adequate sampling of the commu-<lb/>nities in both samples. <lb/>In order to determine the difference in bacterial diversity between two cave locations, the <lb/>true diversity was computed using Shannon-Weiner Index and Shannon entropy. Since diver-<lb/>sity indices alone cannot distinguish two or several unequal samples, it is desirable to deter-<lb/>mine the number of equally-common genus termed as &quot;effective genus number.&quot; In this study, <lb/>effective genus number was calculated as a function of the natural exponent raised to a Shan-<lb/>non entropy value, estimated according to Chao and Shen&apos;s formula from the Shannon index <lb/>[49, 50]. C1 was computed to have an effective genus number of 11.33, while C2 effective <lb/>genus number was 2.04. Thus, the bacterial diversity at genus level in C1 is five times higher <lb/>compared to C2, despite yielding lesser number of OTUs. <lb/>Fig 1.

			<body>Bacterial composition in the two guano samples <lb/>Bacterial OTUs of the representative sequences were taxonomically assigned to a total of 30 <lb/>phyla excluding the unclassified reads. Most OTUs within these phyla belonged to unclassified <lb/>groups suggesting the presence of novel groups of microorganisms. Apparent dominance of <lb/>Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, candidate phylum TM7 <lb/>(or Saccharibacteria), and Planctomycetes in the C1 and C2 guano samples was observed (Fig <lb/>2). C1 and C2 shared 2,467 OTUs (24.8%) classified under 15 phyla, despite being obtained <lb/>from the same cave system inhabited by the same species of bats. The differences between C1 <lb/>and C2 microbiome profiles were attributed to these factors: a) the physico-chemical proper-<lb/>ties of guano; b) decaying process or age of the sampled guanos; c) host species; d) surrounding <lb/>environment. <lb/>Core microbiome of C1 and C2 revealed 117 shared genera. Fourteen genera have relative <lb/>abundance greater than 1% which is dominated by unassigned Xanthomonadaceae and Myco-<lb/>bacterium (Fig 3). Other significantly abundant genera on both C1 and C2 samples include <lb/>Bacillus (1.9% and 0.18%), Luteibacter (3.8% and 5.2%) and Rhodococcus (1.6% and 0.14%). <lb/>Much of the core microbiome members are yet to be classified. <lb/>C1 and C2 samples harbored potentially pathogenic genera such as Burkholderia, Coryne-<lb/>bacterium, Francisella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Rickettsia. This sug-<lb/>gested that guano may act as source of microorganisms that could potentially be pathogenic <lb/>to humans and animals [51]. The frequent intra-and inter-roost movements and long dis-<lb/>tance migrations of bats enhance the potential of bacterial transmission among individuals <lb/>[17, 22, 25, 52]. Presence of beneficial bacteria in bats like probiotics can provide vital func-<lb/>tions to their host such as processing of skin proteins, freeing fatty acids to reduce invasion <lb/>of transient microorganisms and inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms [53-57]. Pseudomo-<lb/>nas spp. isolated from bats, amphibians and plants produce antifungal properties particu-<lb/>larly against Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a causative fungus of white-nose syndrome in <lb/>bats [57]. Dietary habits were, likewise, reported to affect the bat gut microbiome and allow <lb/>Fig 2.

			<body>the acquisition and transmission of infectious agents to other bats and organisms inside a <lb/>cave. [53-55]. Indeed, several insects consumed by insectivorous bats have been found to <lb/>harbor harmful bacteria and indigenous bacteria common in human and animal diseases, <lb/>including Salmonella, Yersinia or Campylobacter species and several enteric pathogens <lb/>[22, 25, 54, 58-64]. Similarly, contaminated fruits [51] or water [25] might also be possible <lb/>sources of bacteria. <lb/>Many members of identified core microbiome of C1 and C2 were uncultured or unclassi-<lb/>fied. These data validate possible presence of novel microorganisms found in the guano sam-<lb/>ples from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan. <lb/>Functional profiles of the two guano samples <lb/>A total of 1136 OTUs were used to predict the functional profile of the microbial communities. <lb/>Using PICRUSt, genes found to be involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, <lb/>nucleotides, lipids, xenobiotics and other compounds were both equally abundant in C1 and <lb/>C2. Pathways involved in biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites such as antimicrobials <lb/>(i.e. streptomycin biosynthesis, novobiocin biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gin-<lb/>gerol biosynthesis, penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, etc.) are inferred based on the <lb/>samples. Other pathways involved in metabolism of xenobiotics and of other compounds (i.e. <lb/>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, chloroalkane and chloroalkene, naphthalene, <lb/>benzoate, aminobenzoate degradation, bisphenol, caprolactam, etc.) were also predicted <lb/>(Fig 4). <lb/>Based on predicted functions of C1 and C2 microbiome, the enrichment of genes related to <lb/>pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipid, and energy were com-<lb/>parably abundant in C1 and C2. This suggested role of microorganisms active in decay and <lb/>biogeochemical processes. Moreover, pathways involved in the biosynthesis of secondary <lb/>metabolites such as antimicrobials and other degrading recalcitrant compounds indicated <lb/>presence possible novel of microorganisms that produce these metabolites. <lb/>Fig 3.

			<body>Comparative analysis of bat guano microbiome <lb/>Bat guano microbiome have been reported from composite guano collected on the cave floor <lb/>(no information about the host bats) and on fresh and decaying guano (source bat is Rousettus <lb/>eschenaultia) from Robber&apos;s Cave in India [22]. Analysis of C1 and C2 microbiome data along <lb/>with previous data from NCBI GenBank database revealed differences in terms of composition <lb/>and relative proportion of bacterial communities. The relative abundances of major phyla in <lb/>previous studies were different. Quality filtered and analyzed sequence reads (SRR868695) <lb/>from the study of Veikkolainen et al. (2014) [44] showed only four dominant phyla, namely, <lb/>Chlamydiae (50%), Proteobacteria (27.8%), Firmicutes (16.7%), and Bacteroidetes (5.6%). In <lb/>the SRR1793374 study of de Mandal et al. (2015) [34] and the CGS study of Banskar et al. <lb/>(2016) [22], at least 28 and 22 bacterial phyla were detected (Fig 5), respectively. Actinobac-<lb/>teria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Proteobacteria dominated in the study of de Mandal <lb/>et al. (2015) [35] while Proteobacteria (54.2%), Bacteroidetes (24.4%) and Actinobacteria <lb/>(8.6%) were the most dominant phyla in the CGS sample of Banskar et al., (2016) [22]. <lb/>To further compare the samples, beta diversity analysis using CGS sample of Banskar et al., <lb/>(2016) [22], the composite guano samples of de Mandal et al., (2015) [35] and the C1 and C2 <lb/>samples were done in QIIME. This comparison was conducted for the representatives of <lb/>decaying guano samples. The core microbiome of CGS, composite guanos, and C1 and C2 <lb/>showed 35 core OTUs (Fig 6). At the Phylum level, the major phyla common to all samples <lb/>are Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, and Saccharibac-<lb/>teria. Bray-Curtis distance and UPGMA cluster analyses revealed that C1 and C2 guano sam-<lb/>ples were more similar than the composite guano and CGS sample. This suggested that C1 <lb/>and C2 microbiome exhibited some unique microbiome profiles, further illustrated in the <lb/>Fig 5. Phylum level distribution of different microbiome studies compared. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200095.g005 <lb/></body>

			<body>correspondence map of four guano samples shown in Fig 7. Moreover, CGS and SRR1793374 <lb/>microbiome profiles were remarkably different from those of C1 and C2. <lb/>Across samples, relatively high abundance of Actinobacteria suggested that members of this <lb/>phylum were conserved in bat guano. Growth of acidophilic Actinobacteria was favored due <lb/>to nutrient-rich acidic bat guano [65]. <lb/>At the genus level, core microbiome of CGS, SRR1793374, C1 and C2 samples shared 27 <lb/>bacterial genera (Fig 8). Majority of the 27 identified core genera are from Actinobacteria, 12, <lb/>and from Proteobacteria, 11. Other genera include Telmatobacter (from Acidobacteria), uncul-<lb/>tured Chloroflexi, Leptospirillum (Nitrospirae), and an uncultured Saccharibacteria. Relative <lb/>abundance of each genus varied across the samples. Streptomyces was one of the most abun-<lb/>dant genera in the core microbiome, followed by Mycobacterium (Fig 8). A number of genera <lb/>under Actinobacteria isolated from limestone caves, such as Streptomyces and Actinomyces, <lb/>were known to produce antimicrobial compounds [66, 67]. Furthermore, some genera in the <lb/>core microbiome, such as Mycobacterium, Burkholderia and Leptospirillum, were known to <lb/>Fig 6.

			<body>have pathogenic species. The observed four microbiomes (including this study) shared com-<lb/>mon OTU under the Enterobacteriaceae family (Genus: Cronobacter). Proteobacteria were <lb/>overrepresented in C1, C2 and CGS samples while Bacteroidetes were relatively most abun-<lb/>dant in CGS [22]. Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes were most abundant in SRR1793374 [35] <lb/>relative to other samples. <lb/>Comparing guano microbiome data of C1 and C2 samples with data on composite and <lb/>decaying guano revealed that it was more similar to each other and were highly different in <lb/>microbial composition. Differences among the samples can be explained by origin, host bat <lb/>species and its diet, duration of the decaying process or age of the guano and other physico-<lb/>chemical properties. In terms of diet, the identified bats (Miniopterus schebersii, M. australis <lb/>and Rhinolophus amplixedectus) were observed to be mainly insectivorous, while R. eschenaul-<lb/>tia from Robber&apos;s Cave is frugivorous. Phillips et al. (2012) reported that herbivorous and <lb/>reproductively active bats carried more diverse microbiota than carnivorous and reproduc-<lb/>tively inactive individuals [68]. According to Carillo-Araujo et al. (2015), diet primarily <lb/>defined the gut microbiome [62]. Banskar et al. (2016) observed that dietary overlap among <lb/>frugivorous and insectivorous bats explained the similarities in gut microbial communities <lb/>[25, 48]. Microbiome profiles observed in fresh and decaying guano might have been affected <lb/>Fig 7.

			<body>by the age of the guano or by the decaying process dependent on physical and environmental <lb/>factors [25]. As the guano age, microorganisms initially present in the guano carry out various <lb/>biogeochemical processes such as organic and inorganic nutrient cycles leading to changes <lb/>in pH and nutritional contents determining increase in bacterial growth and diversity. <lb/>This could explain the difference in microbiome of fresh and decaying guano observed by <lb/>Banskar et al. 2016 [22]. Microorganisms present on the soil or cave floor where the guano, <lb/>was obtained also contributed to the differences. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>High-throughput sequence-based analysis with Illumina MiSeq was used to describe the first <lb/>in-depth study on bacterial community profiles of bat guanos collected in a Philippine cave. <lb/>The microbiome profiles of the Cabalyorisa bat guano exhibited unique characteristics. Meta-<lb/>genomic analysis of OTUs from bat guano revealed it as a source of potentially pathogenic <lb/>bacteria and/or novel functional genes. Difference on bacterial diversity between C1 and C2 <lb/>samples may be attributed to differences of host species, diet and other physico-chemical char-<lb/>acteristics of the guano and its environmental surroundings. This first report on bat guano col-<lb/>lected in Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan stirred scientific interest for possibilities of <lb/>isolating and characterizing novel bacteria with multiple functions for production of antibiot-<lb/>ics and enzymes. On the downside, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria may impose <lb/>health hazards to local folks harvesting guano for agricultural purposes. <lb/></body>
