			<body>1. Introduction. The &quot;low level&quot; analysis of monodimensional and bidimensional <lb/>signals presents two opposite requirements. We generally wish to extract the tendency <lb/>of the signal. This corresponds to a rather nonlocal analysis of the signal. For instance, <lb/>we may look for regions of an image where the signal is of constant mean. <lb/>On the other hand, we wish to determine accurately where the signal changes its <lb/>tendency. In the case of image analysis, the curves where this happens are called <lb/>&quot;edges&quot; [16]. In the classical theory, the tendency of the signal can be extracted by a <lb/>low pass filtering 1241-[26]. This theory comes from Marr and Hildreth [16] and has <lb/>been better formalized by Witkin, Koenderink, and improved by Canny [6]. The low <lb/>pass filtering is made by convolution with Gaussians of increasing variance. Then the <lb/>&quot;edges&quot; are defined as the set of points where the norm of the gradient of the resulting <lb/>smooth signal has a local maximum. (The set of &quot;edges&quot; is therefore contained in the <lb/>set of the points where the Laplacian of the smoothed signal changes sign.) The <lb/>necessity of a previous low pass filtering is easily understood: if the signal is noisy, <lb/>the gradient will have a lot of irrelevant maxima which must be eliminated. Of course, <lb/>strong oscillations can be due to different causes, for instance, to the presence of <lb/>&quot;textures.&quot; According to the above-mentioned edge detection theory, the boundaries <lb/>of different textured regions can be found only if the mean value of the signal is <lb/>different for each texture. Witkin [25] noticed that the convolution of the signal with <lb/>Gaussians at each scale was equivalent to the solving of the heat equation with the <lb/>signal as initial datum. Denote by uo this datum. Then the &quot;scale space&quot; analysis <lb/>associated with uo consists in solving the system <lb/>(1.1) <lb/>~u ( x , <lb/>t)/dt = Au(x, t), <lb/>U(X, 0)= uO(x). <lb/>The solution of this equation in one dimension and for an initial datum with bounded <lb/>quadratic norm is u(x, t) = G, * u, where <lb/>G,(x) = <lb/>exp (-x2/4a) <lb/>is the Gaussian function. Then x is an edge point for the &quot;scale&quot; t1I2 at points where <lb/>Au(x, t) changes sign and IVU(X, t)l is &quot;large.&quot; Of course, this last condition introduces <lb/></body>

			<body>an a priori defined threshold. Unfortunately, it is well known (and it is enough to look <lb/>at the &quot;edges&quot; found by this method to know it well [13]) that the edges at low scales <lb/>give an inexact account of the boundaries which, according to our perception, should <lb/>be considered correct. This is still true for the low pass filtering of Canny [6], [23] <lb/>which is generally used as the best linear filter for white noise elimination and edge <lb/>detection. An important improvement of the edge detection theory has been introduced <lb/>by Malik and Perona [23]. They propose to replace the heat equation by a nonlinear <lb/>equation of the porous medium type: <lb/>auldt = div (g(lVul)Vu), <lb/>u(0) = u,. <lb/>In this equation, g is a smooth nonincreasing function with g(0) = 1, g ( x )2 0, and <lb/>g(x) tending to zero at infinity. The idea is that the smoothing process obtained by <lb/>the equation is &quot;conditional&quot;: if Vu(x) is large, then the diffusion will be low and <lb/>therefore the exact localization of the &quot;edges&quot; will be kept. If Vu(x) is small, then the <lb/>diffusion will tend to smooth still more around x. Thus the choice of g corresponds <lb/>to a sort of thresholding which has to be compared to the thresholding of l~u l <lb/>used <lb/>in the final step of the classical theory. Since this thresholding introduces a nonlinear <lb/>device anyway, it was natural to ask whether it could not be used earlier in the method, <lb/>in the smoothing process itself. The experimental results obtained by Malik and Perona <lb/>are perceptually impressive and show that an &quot;edge detector&quot; based on this theory <lb/>gives edges which remain much more stable across the scales. (This property has been <lb/>sought by many researchers in the past two decades.) <lb/>However, the Malik and Perona model has several serious practical and theoretical <lb/>difficulties which this paper aims to solve. The first is a straightforward objection that <lb/>every researcher in signal analysis will surely raise (and that Malik and Perona <lb/>themselves considered). Assume that the signal is noisy, with white noise, for instance. <lb/>Then the noise introduces very large, in theory unbounded, oscillations of the gradient <lb/>Vu. Thus the conditional smoothing introduced by the model will not help, since all <lb/>these noise edges will be kept! <lb/>Malik and Perona proposed to eliminate this difficulty by a first smoothing of the <lb/>image using some low pass filter. It seems to work well in practice, but it is nonetheless <lb/>a trick which should be avoided in a correct theory. An obvious drawback is the <lb/>introduction in the method of a new parameter, the variance of the Gaussian with <lb/>which this preliminary smoothing should be made. Moreover, the theory seems to adopt <lb/>again what it tried to avoid: a nonadaptive filtering which makes lost the accuracy of <lb/>the edges. <lb/>The second difficulty arises from the equation itself; among the functions g which <lb/>Malik and Perona consider admissible are found functions of the type g(s) = e-&quot; or <lb/>g ( s ) = (1 +s2)-&apos; for which no correct theory of (1.2) is available. Indeed, in order to <lb/>obtain both existence and uniqueness of the solutions, g must verify that sg(s) is <lb/>nondecreasing. If this condition is not verified, we can observe for some functions g <lb/>with sg(s) nonincreasing a nondeterministic and therefore unstable process; the same <lb/>picture in theory can be the initial condition of solutions divergent in time (see [ l l ] <lb/>for simple and explicit examples, and also [8]). In practice, that means that very close <lb/>pictures can produce divergent solutions and therefore diferent edges. This is certainly a <lb/>drawback for most applications; think, for instance, of stereo vision, where this situation <lb/>arises. However, it would be reasonable to try to define a model where the function <lb/>g, which is a sort of thresholding, will be quickly decreasing, as e-&quot;, for instance. <lb/>Before arriving at an improved model, let us just sketch why, if sg(s) is nonincreasing, <lb/>Perona and Malik&apos;s equation will be an ill-posed problem. Without loss of generality, <lb/>

			take the case where the signal is one-dimensional. The equation becomes duldt -<lb/>(g(ut)u&apos;)&apos;= 0, that is, duldt -(gt(u&apos;)u&apos;+ g(ut))u&quot;= 0. If sg(s) is decreasing at some s <lb/>and therefore with a negative derivative -a at s, and if it happens that at some point <lb/>x, ut(x) = s, then the equation looks near x like duldt + a u &quot; = 0. This is the inverse <lb/>heat equation, which actually is known to be ill posed; starting with a smooth initial <lb/>datum, it can develop singularities of any order in arbitrarily small time. (This equation <lb/>is well known in signal processing, since inverting it would provide a perfect deblurring <lb/>algorithm [22].) <lb/>The model which we now propose is a synthesis of Malik and Perona&apos;s ideas <lb/>which avoids the above-mentioned difficulties; it will be robust in the presence of noise <lb/>and will be consistent from the formal viewpoint described above. Moreover, it will <lb/>be based, as in the space scale theory of Witkin, on a single parameter: the scale. <lb/>We shall define the &quot;selective smoothing&quot; of u, at scale t112 as the function u(x, t) <lb/>verifying <lb/>(1.3) <lb/>&amp;/at -div (~(IDG, * ul)vu) = 0 in 10, T [x R, <lb/>u(0) = uo, <lb/>where G,(x) = C U -&quot;·∫Ωxp (-1xI2/4a). It is easily seen that G(x, t) = G,(x) is nothing <lb/>but the fundamental solution of the heat equation. Therefore, the term (DG, * u)(x, t) <lb/>which appears inside the divergence term of (1.3) is simply the gradient of the solution <lb/>at time a of the heat equation with u(x, t) as initial datum. Thus it appears to be an <lb/>estimate of the gradient of u at point x, obtained by the classical Marr-Hildreth-Witkin <lb/>theory, recalled above. The modification of the model of Malik and Perona, therefore, <lb/>is only to replace the gradient lvul by its estimate I D G , * ul. As we shall prove, this <lb/>slight change of the model is enough to avoid both inconsistencies of the Malik and <lb/>Perona model. Indeed, the equation, as announced by those authors, will now diffuse <lb/>if and only if the gradient is estimated to be small, the job of this estimate being done <lb/>by the new term which we introduce. This does not alter the scope of the &quot;anisotropic <lb/>diffusion&quot; model. Indeed, the initial datum in the new equation is u,, and the necessity <lb/>of smoothing the initial datum u, by a Gaussian in order to eliminate the noisy estimates <lb/>of lVul is now removed. Moreover, (1.3) can be proved to have a unique smooth <lb/>solution. The main part of this paper is devoted to the proof of existence, uniqueness, <lb/>and regularity properties for (1.3). We shall work with two-dimensional data-like <lb/>pictures, and therefore defined, without loss of generality, on a square. (With the <lb/>adequate changes in the definition of the convolution (see later), the domain where <lb/>the signal is defined may be a rectangle, a disk, or any open set with smooth enough <lb/>boundary.) <lb/>The function G to be considered can be any &quot;low pass filter,&quot; or, to use the <lb/>terminology of calculus, any smoothing kernel. However, in order to preserve the <lb/>notion of scale in the gradient estimate, it is convenient that this kernel depends on a <lb/>scale parameter. A good and classical example is, as mentioned above, the Gaussian. <lb/>It is important to keep this particular case in mind. Indeed, a question which arises <lb/>immediately in the consideration of model (1.3) is what time is best for &quot;stopping&quot; <lb/>the evolution of the signal u(x, t). This choice is quite important, since it is clear that <lb/>all of the above-mentioned models, including ours, diffuse completely at t + +aand <lb/>give therefore a constant function. Now we may appeal to the Witkin model to answer <lb/>this question: according to this model, time is interpreted as a &quot;scale factor.&quot; (More <lb/>precisely, the solution u(x, t) at time t corresponds to a scale t112. Indeed, roughly <lb/>speaking, u(x, t) appears in the Witkin model as a smooth version of u, obtained by <lb/>convolving it with a filter of spatial width t1I2.) Thus in the model (1.3) it is coherent <lb/>to correlate the stopping time t and the time introduced via the estimator G,. We <lb/></body>

			<body>should therefore choose a stopping time t of the order of o: Then the spatial scale <lb/>under which the signal is smoothed in regular zones of the image will be of the order <lb/>of t&quot;*. On the parts of the picture where edges are present, the situation is different. <lb/>Since the scope of the equation is to delay diffusion in these zones, the scale at which <lb/>edge information is lost will depend on the shape of the thresholding function g. <lb/>Therefore, even if we wrote above that we should stop the equation at a time of the <lb/>order of a, this is rather a lower estimate and there is no inconsistency in looking at <lb/>what happens to the signal u(x, t) for times greater than a. In experimentation, it <lb/>might be convenient to play with two parameters that are anyway at hand in any edge <lb/>detection model: the scale parameter (spatial width of the filtering) on the one side, <lb/>all2,and the threshold parameter for edges, which is implicit in the shape of g. If g <lb/>is near 1 on some interval containing zero and decreases briskly at the end b of this <lb/>interval, then b is the threshold for edges. Where [~u / <lb/>is greater than b, the edges will <lb/>remain and where it is smaller, they will disappear. Thus it is clear that if our model <lb/>is used as a preliminary step for an edge detection device, we might use the same <lb/>threshold b on the gradient for keeping the edges as the one implicit in g. <lb/>Before beginning with the proofs of the consistency of our model, let us give a <lb/>brief account of several related works which came to our knowledge as this work was <lb/>in the final experimental phase. Osher and Rudin&apos;s theory [22] tries to get as close as <lb/>possible to the inverse heat equation by defining some conservative scheme like <lb/>duldt = -lu,l~(u,,) with initial datum u,. F is a function such that sF(s) 2 0. The <lb/>big advantage of this new method is to have a scheme which lets the image develop <lb/>true edges, that is, shock lines along which u(x, t ) becomes discontinuous in x. <lb/>Nordstrom [21] proposes a new presentation of Perona and Malik&apos;s theory which <lb/>relates it to the well-known variational global edge detection methods of Terzopoulos, <lb/>Blake and Zisserman, and Mumford and Shah [18]. Nordstrom introduces a new term <lb/>in (1.2) which forces u(x, t ) to remain close to u,. Because of the forcing term u -u,, <lb/>the new equation <lb/>duldt -div (g(Vu)Vu) = u,-u <lb/>has a priori the advantage of having a nontrivial steady state, eliminating therefore <lb/>the problem of choosing a stopping time. (Of course, we can do the same in our model <lb/>and the proof below is not altered by this modification.) However, there is the same <lb/>theoretical difficulty as in Malik and Perona&apos;s model for this equation, at least for the <lb/>g proposed by Nordstrom; tg(t) decreases at infinity and the author insists in wanting <lb/>this phenomenon to happen. The maximum y of tg(t) should play the role of edge <lb/>thresholding; if the gradient is locally greater than y, then there would be enhancement <lb/>(and as a matter of fact, the equation behaves locally as an inverse heat equation). <lb/>Conversely, if the gradient happens to have a norm smaller than y, then diffusion will <lb/>continue. This fact eliminates every hope of getting a uniqueness and regularity theorem <lb/>for the solution u(x, t ) . Therefore, the maximum principle stated in the same paper is <lb/>empty; the c2assumption for the solution u(x, t) generally is not verified. Thus the <lb/>observed numerical stability of the attained solution is not likely to be theoretically <lb/>justified and should depend strongly on the kind of discretization that was considered. <lb/>However, the model that we propose could explain this stability. Indeed, discrete <lb/>schemes are likely to introduce an implicit diffusion and therefore to &quot;blurr&quot; the <lb/>computed solution. <lb/>Our scheme contains this blurring explicitly and, as a matter of fact, we &quot;see&quot; no <lb/>significant difference between the experimental results obtained by Perona and Malik, <lb/>by Nordstrom, and by Nitzberg and Shiota [20], whose work we shall comment on <lb/>

			now. The approach of these authors is related to adaptive filtering methods which <lb/>were introduced for TV images denoising by Graham [lo]. The idea is to blur <lb/>selectively and anisotropically the signal with &quot;oblong&quot; Gaussians. The Gaussian used <lb/>for blurring at a point x depends on the intensity and direction of the gradient in the <lb/>neighborhood. Roughly speaking, the blurring will be faster in the direction orthogonal <lb/>to the gradient. Therefore, the signal will be smoothed on both sides of an edge, but <lb/>the edge will be conserved. Since a corner is the crossing point of two edges, there <lb/>will be two directions of &quot;nondiffusion&quot; instead of one, and therefore corners will be <lb/>well conserved by this method. Nitzberg and Shiota&apos;s method is truly &quot;anisotropic&quot; <lb/>at each point, in contrast to Perona and Malik&apos;s diffusion equation, which is quite <lb/>isotropic. Moreover, Nitzberg and Shiota prove by a scaling argument that as the size <lb/>of the Gaussians tends to zero, their diffusion method tends to some ill-posed partial <lb/>differential equation analogous to Malik and Perona&apos;s. Their method appears, therefore, <lb/>to be an alternative solution to ours for avoiding ill posedness, and it provides true <lb/>anisotropic analysis, which our model does not take into account. In our opinion, its <lb/>only drawback is the increased number of parameters. In the same paper is proposed <lb/>another scheme for making (1.2) well posed. The idea is quite similar to that proposed <lb/>here. One just replaces the gradient Vu by some smoothed version v of it by setting <lb/>(we omit the scale parameters) <lb/>duldt = div ((1 +v)-&apos;Vu), doldt = G * IlVul12-v. <lb/>Since the second equation is intended to be a regularization of the steady state <lb/>v = G * Ivu~*, it is clear that this system boils down to our proposed equation. <lb/>However, the case where G has zero variance, that is, no convolution is actually <lb/>done, might still lead to a well-posed system. The same paper states a conjecture of <lb/>Mumford according to which the preceding system (without convolution) should have <lb/>global solutions and approach a step function as time tends to infinity. We therefore <lb/>would have a model quite close to Osher and Rudin&apos;s mentioned above, for which <lb/>this last property is ensured. <lb/>Finally, let us mention an approach very different in technique but quite close in <lb/>spirit and experimental results, namely, that due to Mallat and Zhong [14]. Mallat <lb/>and Zhong use wavelet transform as a multiscale edge detection device, and are able <lb/>to reconstruct an image from its edges. They use this new reconstruction technique to <lb/>build a selective edge removing. The idea is to keep only edges present at several <lb/>scales, to remove the other ones, and then apply the reconstruction algorithm to this <lb/>simplified edge map. The result is visually almost equivalent to our version of <lb/>anisotropic diffusion. Indeed, we also introduced a conditional edge removing by <lb/>plugging the convolution by a Gaussian into our equation. In essence, that means that <lb/>an edge is kept only if present at a coarser scale. <lb/>In the next section we shall state and prove the main existence and uniqueness <lb/>results announced above. In H 3, we describe briefly the numerical scheme which was <lb/>used in experimentations and present some experimental results on pictures. As we <lb/>said, they are not much different from those obtained by the authors mentioned above. <lb/>Now our scope is to obtain a correct and simple theory of what can be &quot;nonlinear <lb/>scale space,&quot; and to define mathematically experimental devices which should be stable <lb/>and reliable. <lb/>2.

In this first section, we show the existence of a <lb/>weak solution of (2.1) by a classical fixed point theorem of Schauder [9], [19]. We <lb/>introduce the space <lb/>This space is a Hilbert space for the graph norm [13]. Let w G W(0, T) f l Lm(O,T, L2(fl)) <lb/>such that <lb/>and ( E , ) the problem <lb/>u(0) = u,. <lb/>Since w E L&quot;(0, T; L2(0)) and g, G are C&quot;, one easily deduces that g(lvG, * wl) E <lb/>Lm(O, T; %&quot;(a)). Thus, since g is decreasing, there exists a constant v &gt;0 such that <lb/>where v depends only on g, G and 11 uollL~( o ) . <lb/>By classical results on parabolic equations [3], [4], we prove that the problem <lb/>(E,) as a unique solution U(w) in W(0, T) [I], [4]. Then we can deduce <lb/>where C,, C2, and C3 are constants which only depends on G, g, and u,. These estimates <lb/>lead us to introduce the subset Wo of W(0, T) defined by <lb/>By (2.2)-(2.4), U is a mapping from W, into W,. Moreover, W, is a nonempty, convex, <lb/>and weakly compact subset of W(0, T). <lb/>In order to use the Schauder theorem, we need to prove that the mapping u is <lb/>weakly continuous from W, into W,. <lb/>Since W(0, T) is contained in L2(0, T; L2(fl)), with compact inclusion, this will <lb/>provide u in W, such that u = U(u). <lb/>Let (wj) be a sequence in W, which converges weakly to some w in Wo and <lb/>uj = U(wj). <lb/>By using (2.2), (2.4), and classical theorems of compact inclusion (the theorem <lb/>of Rellich and Kondrachov [4]), the sequence (wj) of W, contains a subsequence (w,) <lb/></body>

An iterative scheme which converges to the solution of (2.1). <lb/>THEOREM 3.1. Let U O E L 2 ( R ) .

			<body>From (3.5) we conclude that the sequence ( u n ) , converges in %([O, TI; L&apos;(R)) to the <lb/>strong solution of (2.1). <lb/>O <lb/>4. Numerical results and experiments. <lb/>4.1. Discretisation. We introduce the lattice of coordinates (ih, jh, n A t ) where <lb/>h = 1 / N + 1 , O S i S N + 1 , O S j S N + 1 ; and we denote u;, an approximation of <lb/>u(ih, jh; n At); a ;, an approximation of ~( I v G * u()(ih, jh, n At). Then we discretise <lb/>[~( I v G * ul)au/ax] by a;,au/ax(ih, jh, (n + 1)At) and a / a x [ g [ l ( v G * u)l]au/ax] by <lb/>1 <lb/>-[(a:-l,,+ ~: , ) U ? ? , &apos;~-(~C Y :~+ <lb/>a:-l,,+ a7+l,j)u:&apos;1 + (a;,+ a7+l,j)uY?:j], <lb/>2h2 <lb/>similarly for a / a y [ g l ( v G * u)lau/ay] by exchanging the roles of i and j. <lb/>Finally, we obtain the implicit scheme <lb/>Now the discrete problem can be written <lb/>where the matrix Ah is tridiagonal by blocks and positive defined. By classical arguments <lb/>[7], we know that the matrix I+AtAh(un) is invertible. <lb/>4.2. Some comments on the results of applying the schema to several images. Figures <lb/>1 and 2 show a tomography picture from the University of Joseph Fourier at Grenoble <lb/>and its &quot;cleaned&quot; version by anisotropic diffusion. As indicated in the introduction, <lb/>the experiments depend on two parameters: the time t (which yields the &quot;scale&quot; of <lb/>diffusion) and the threshold O under which diffusion is strong and above which <lb/>diffusion is low. In Fig. 2, t = 2 and 0 = 10. Figure 3 is an original picture by the <lb/>Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, and Fig. 4 its <lb/>diffusion with t = 2 and O = 20. Notice how texture present in many parts of the picture <lb/>is removed while the edges are kept. Figure 5 is an original Eizo picture. Figure 6 <lb/>shows its diffusion with t = 2 and O = 20. <lb/></body>
