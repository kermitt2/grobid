			<body>Introduction <lb/>Ongoing research on marasmioid and gymnopoid fungi (Antonín and Noordeloos <lb/>2010; Antonín et al. 2014; Mata et al. 2004; Petersen and Hughes 2016, 2017; Wilson <lb/>and Desjardin 2005), has led to significant renovation of Gymnopus sensu lato. Several <lb/>additional genera have been proposed and molecular phylogenetic analyses have re-<lb/>vealed numerous small clades within Gymnopus sensu stricto. One such clade includes <lb/>Marasmius brevipes Berk. &amp; Ravenel. The result is the necessary transfer of M. brevipes <lb/>to Gymnopus and proposal of a new species, G. portoricensis. <lb/>Nomenclaturally, recombination of Marasmius brevipes into Gymnopus produces <lb/>a conflict between two potential homonyms, of which Gymnopus brevipes (Bull.) S.F. <lb/>Gray has priority. A new name is required for Marasmius (Gymnopus) brevipes and this <lb/>is introduced below as Gymnopus neobrevipes. <lb/></body>

Colour names enclosed in quota-<lb/>tion marks (&quot;&quot;) are from Ridgway (1912) and those cited alphanumerically are from <lb/>Kornerup and Wanscher (1967). BF = bright field microscopy; PhC = phase contrast <lb/>microscopy. Microscopic structures were observed in 3% aqueous potassium hydrox-<lb/>ide (KOH) without staining. Spore metrics are expressed as Q = the range of spore <lb/>length divided by spore width; Q m = mean value of Q. <lb/>All photos of microscopic structures were taken using a Q c Olympus camera mount-<lb/>ed on an Olympus BX60 research microscope fitted with phase contrast microscopy. <lb/>Molecular methods were described in Petersen and Hughes (Petersen and Hughes <lb/>2016; see also Petersen and Hughes 2017). An LSU-based PhyML phylogeny il-<lb/>lustrates general placement of section Androsacei within Gymnopus and related taxa <lb/>(Fig. 1). An ITS-based PhyML phylogeny was constructed to show more detailed <lb/>placement of the two species below within Section Androsacei (Fig. 2). ITS and LSU <lb/>sequences used in this paper are available in GenBank. Aligned ITS and LSU sequenc-<lb/>es are available in the Dryad depository (ITS: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rd1df0c; <lb/>LSU : https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4081h). <lb/>Results <lb/>Phylogenetic placement <lb/>Clade A of Mata et al. (2007) containing section Androsacei falls within /gymnopus of <lb/>Wilson and Desjardin (2005) based on nuclear LSU sequences with moderate boot-<lb/>strap support (Fig. 1). The small clade containing G. portoricensis and G. neobrevipes <lb/>also appears in /A. At the ITS level, G. portoricensis and G. neobrevipes appear as a sister <lb/>clade to Gymnopus androsaceus (Fig. 2). Two environmental sequences from Okinawa <lb/>and Gymnopus cremeostipitatus (South Korea), placed by Antonín et al. (2014) within <lb/>Section Androsacei, are also related to G. portoricensis and G. neobrevipes. <lb/>Taxonomy <lb/>1. Gymnopus neobrevipes R.H.

Pileo convexo estriato atro-sanguineo; stipitate brevi filiformi ater-<lb/>riimo nitida e mycelio repente similari enato; lamellis paucis adnatis rufis. Rav. No. <lb/>1527. On dead twigs of oak, June, Santee Canal, South Carolina, H.W. Ravenel, Esq. <lb/>&quot;Pileus 1-2 line broad, convex, dark blood red; margin even; stem filiform, jet <lb/>black, quite smooth, 1-2 line high, springing from creeping mycelial thread of the <lb/>same nature with itself; gills ventricose, few, adnate, rufous. <lb/>&quot;Allied to M. haematocephalus, &amp;s, but distinguished at once by its short polished <lb/>stem and dark gills. The colour of the pileus is nearly that of M. atrorubens. &quot; <lb/>The pileipellis structure is similar to others described in sect. Androsacei. Desjardin <lb/>and Petersen (1989) described pileipellis as not gelatinised (the tissue is not so), but <lb/>failed to describe the gelatinisation of individual hyphae. This gelatinisation is merely <lb/>a minor gelatinous sheath of individual hyphae for the outline of hyphal wall is not <lb/>altered. However, the flake-like encrustation is carried on the gel surface and is seen at <lb/>some small distance from the hyphal wall outline. <lb/>Amongst basidia in a mount soaked in KOH overnight, structures are seen which <lb/>can be interpreted as gelatinised cheilocystidia. In rare cases, the remnants of digitate <lb/>branching can be seen, but usually nothing is left of the supporting cell but some <lb/>ghost-like structure. In a mount of lamellar edge only briefly in KOH, an enormous <lb/>amount of debris is detected surrounding hymenial structures. It appears to be some <lb/>sort of degeneration, quite possibly partial gelatinisation, but including numerous rod-<lb/>shaped bacteria. This may be another indication of gelatinisation of tissues, this time of <lb/>old basidia and subhymenial hyphae. <lb/>Subbasidial hyphae (subhymenium) become zig-zag in form as basidia are formed, <lb/>evacuate and disappear. These hyphae are easily mistaken for some sort of cystidial <lb/>structures, especially cheilocystidia. <lb/>A chronology of authoritative literature follows. Singer (in Dennis 1953) supplied <lb/>a detailed description of G. neobrevipes (as Mi. brevipes) and Dennis (1953) examined <lb/>type material and offered a rather uninformative illustration. Dennis (1970) offered a <lb/>description of M. brevipes (as Micromphale), but perhaps as valuable is a diminutive <lb/>aquarelle (Pl. 8, Fig. 4) which provides a good representation. Perhaps the best descrip-<lb/>tion of G. neobrevipes (as Mi. brevipes) was offered by Pegler (1983) and the description <lb/>was based on more specimens than the type. Desjardin (1989: 447-449) examined the <lb/>type of M. brevipes and Desjardin and Petersen (1989) published a species description <lb/>based on numerous specimens. <lb/>Pileipellis structures, especially erect broom cell-like cells, are often gelatinised, es-<lb/>pecially in age. Likewise, cheilocystidia, while observed only occasionally, are often <lb/>reduced to debris by gelatinisation or occasionally produce apical growths which can <lb/>attain significant length. Lamellar tramal hyphae are often observed as thick-walled, <lb/>but usually this is due to gelatinisation of the hyphal walls (inner wall boundary is clear, <lb/>but outer wall boundary is obliterated and the gelatinised wall appears as though thick). <lb/>Pegler (1983) included Mi. brevipes as the only representative of Micromphale in <lb/>the Lesser Antilles. <lb/></body>

Scale bars: 10 µm. <lb/>Rhizomorphs of G. neobrevipes are viable and short surface-sterilised sections (cir-<lb/>cum 1 cm) placed on malt extract agar produce sprays of mycelium from severed ends <lb/>within 24 hrs. Within 72 h, the emergent mycelial sprays can be excised to establish <lb/>an independent dikaryon culture which can be used for sequencing. In the case of G. <lb/>neobrevipes, not only are sprays of mycelium produced on the cut ends (Fig. 4C), but <lb/>within 72 h, many lateral hyphae emerge from the rhizomorph surface, soon resem-<lb/>bling brownish fur.

They concluded that M. porphyreticus &quot;differs mainly in absence of <lb/>cheilocystidia and in forming &apos;plicatosulcate&apos; pilei.&quot; Other discriminating characters of <lb/>M. porphyreticus: &quot;slightly thinner pileus context, more regularly forked lamellae, and <lb/>basidiomata not arising directly from rhizomorphs.&quot; Significantly, presence or absence <lb/>of clamp connections was not mentioned.

Saba-<lb/>na, trail 3, 1.VI.1992, coll RHP, TFB 4548 (TENN-F-051029). GenBank: KY026628-9. <lb/>Etymology. Portoricensis referring to collections made in Puerto Rico. <lb/>Diagnosis. 1) Basidiomata small, resembling those of Gymnopus neobrevipes, aris-<lb/>ing from rhizomorphs or from woody substrate, often in clusters of significant num-<lb/>bers; 2) stipe slightly eccentric or central, strongly curved, dark brown (black only at <lb/>base); 3) rhizomorphs luxuriant, brown (not black); 4) spores somewhat small for the <lb/>clade, (5-)6-7 × (2.5-)3-4 µm. <lb/>Description. Basidiomata (Fig. 10) marasmielloid, cespitose to imbricate, con-<lb/>chate when young becoming shallowly convex to applanate by maturity, stipitate. Pi-<lb/>leus 2-11 mm broad, circular to broadly reniform, matt, radially rivulose outwards, <lb/>thin, leathery, uniformly &quot;light pinkish-cinnamon&quot; (7A2) to &quot;pinkish-cinnamon&quot; <lb/>(7B5). Lamellae well-defined (-0.6 mm broad and ventricose to reduced, pleated or <lb/>fold-like, distant (total folds = 11-18; through folds = 7-10), concolorous to pileus or <lb/>&quot;tilleul buff&quot; (7B2); edge entire. Stipe very small (1-2.5 × 0.5-0.7 mm), slender, cen-<lb/>tral or eccentric, strongly curved to non-instititious attachment on substrate (wood or <lb/>rhizomorph), &quot;Mikado brown&quot; (7C6) apically, downwards &quot;warm sepia&quot; (7F6), &quot;bis-<lb/>ter&quot; (5F8) to black; basal tuft insignificant, blond. Rhizomorphs extensive, slender, <lb/>brown, near &quot;tawny olive&quot; (5C5) or &quot;sayal brown&quot; (6C5) to nearly black. Odour and <lb/>taste negligible. <lb/>Habitat. Outer surface of old bamboo (TENN-F-051029) or rotting twigs of <lb/>deciduous trees (TENN-F-050999). <lb/>Pileipellis (Figs 11A, B, 12, 13 ) composed of three elements involved in very <lb/>thin mucoid matrix: 1) hair-like, probably erect hyphal apices (Figs 11B, 12), 30-120 <lb/>× 1.5-3 µm (at widest point), subtly capitulate apically, arising as side branches of <lb/>slender hyphae (not from clamps), firm-but indistinct-walled, delicately decorated <lb/>with gritty deposits or a very thin mucoid sheath, tapering to 1-1.5 µm diam. and <lb/>subrefringent especially at very apex; 2) repent, heavily ornamented hyphae (Figs 11A, <lb/>13B) 3-9 µm diam., firm-walled, strongly encrusted in stripes or patches with no pro-<lb/>file calluses; contents more or less homogeneous; 3) scattered rudimentary diverticu-<lb/>late hyphal apices (Figs 11A, 13A) 4-7.5 µm diam., often appearing stout-tibiiform, <lb/>with diverticula lobate, 2-5 × 1.5-2.5 µm; contents more or less homogeneous. Pi-<lb/>leus trama loosely interwoven; hyphae (Fig. 13C) 3-7.5 µm diam., conspicuously <lb/>clamped, appearing thick-walled but gelatinised (wall -1.5 µm thick). Pleurocystidia <lb/>(Figs 11C, 14A-D) 21-29 × 4-5 µm, fusiform, conspicuously clamped; contents <lb/>homogeneous, occasionally subtly partitioned. Basidioles clavate, clamped; basidia <lb/>(Figs 11C, 14F, G) 20-30 × 6-8 µm, 4-sterigmate, clavate, clamped; contents with <lb/>scattered, minute guttules. Effete basidia do not disappear; at least the lateral walls <lb/>survive to create debris in which turgid basidia are embedded in hymenial debris. <lb/></body>

Although basidiomata superficially resemble those of G. neobrevi-<lb/>pes, the pileipellis structure is not similar.

			<body>in G. neobrevipes. Morphologically, G. portoricensis could be placed in Marasmiel-<lb/>lus (see Retnowati 2018) based on poorly developed Ramealis-structure, no broom <lb/>cells), but it equally could be interpreted as a reduced member of Androsacei (includ-<lb/>ing G. neobrevipes) in which erect, broom cell-like pileipellis cells are rare to missing. <lb/>Cheilocystidia are typical of the latter group. If G. neobrevipes is accommodated in <lb/>Gymnopus sect. Androsacei, G. portoricensis must also be found there. ITS sequences <lb/>confirm this placement (Fig. 2). <lb/>Inspection shows that almost no basidiomata originate from rhizomorphs, instead <lb/>seemingly originating from woody substrate directly. Rare basidiomata, however, do <lb/>arise from rhizomorphs, with stipes as side branches. Moreover, some twigs with ba-<lb/>sidiomata are devoid of rhizomorphs altogether. <lb/>Figure 12.

			<body>A polyspore dikaryon culture was established from TENN-F-050999 and careful <lb/>examination revealed exceedingly rare (but clearly demonstrated) clamp connections. <lb/>This condition is also true in cultures of G. neobrevipes.

			<body>Basidiomata are not pseudo-or eccentrically stipitate, but centrally to slightly ec-<lb/>centrically stipitate. The stipe, however, is usually immediately curved through the <lb/>declivity in the pileus circumference.

			<body>ly defined (not merely as folds). Interlamellar anastomoses are absent and even lamellar <lb/>buttressing is missing. Instead, the interlamellar hymenophore is smooth. <lb/>These two collections fruited on very different substrata. The origin within bam-<lb/>boo structures would be difficult to imagine, so perhaps basidiomata arise from a very <lb/>thin, arachnoid mycelium on the bamboo surface. Rare basidiomata were seen at-<lb/>tached to rhizomorphs, which might support typical attachment to somatic hyphae. <lb/>If G. portoricensis is regarded as in Marasmius, the epithet (portoricensis) is preoc-<lb/>cupied by Marasmius portoricensis Murrill in Pennington. 1915. North American Flora <lb/>9(4): 262. The homonym is in Marasmius but not in Gymnopus. Described as having <lb/>the longest (&quot;longissimus&quot;) stipe -6-8 cm × 0.5 mm -and pileus 4-10 mm broad, <lb/>the holotype of Marasmius portoricensis is at NY (isotype MICH) and the Mycoportal <lb/>record shows several long-stiped basidiomata with stipe yellow-orange and apparently <lb/>several long, straight rhizomorphs of similar colour. <lb/>An ITS-based clade (Fig. 2), which includes Gymnopus neobrevipes, G. portoricensis, <lb/>two environmental sequences from Okinawa and a sequence of Gymnopus cremeostipi-<lb/>tatus from Korea, is sister to the rest of Gymnopus sect. Androsacesi. This section contin-<lb/>ues to expand with additional taxa yet to be determined and described. <lb/>Figure 15. Gymnopus portoricensis. Cheilocystidia. Scale bar: 20 µm.

Rhizomorphigena based, in part, on his per-<lb/>ception of gelatinisation of tissues in the pileus of the type species, Marasmius westii <lb/>Murrill, (1945). Desjardin (1989) and Desjardin and Petersen (1989) concluded that <lb/>diagnostic characters of M. brevipes matched those of M. westii and nomenclaturally, <lb/>the epithet brevipes took priority. Moreover, these same characters more closely resem-<lb/>bled those of Marasmius sect. Androsacei Kühner (1933) than those of Micromphale <lb/>and they transferred Singer&apos;s section as Marasmius sect. Rhizomorphigena. <lb/>César et al. (2018) considered Marasmius brevipes and M. westii as taxonomic syn-<lb/>onyms and transferred the latter as Gymnopus westii. Based on our current examination <lb/>of the type specimen of M. westii (FLAS-F-17211), we reject this synonymy. Some <lb/>differences: 1) Hymenial elements are without clamp connections in M. westii while <lb/>clamp connections are common in all tissues in M. brevipes (Desjardin and Petersen <lb/>1989 and this study); 2) pleurocystidia are not mammilate; 3) rhizomorphs are consid-<lb/>erably thinner than those of G. neobrevipes; and 4) Murrill&apos;s notes with the type of M. <lb/>westii describe rhizomorphs as &quot;aerial&quot; (i.e. suspended above ground level) while those <lb/>of G. neobrevipes are at or near ground level, predominantly bound to fallen substrate <lb/>with some aerial elements. <lb/></body>
