			<body>Introduction <lb/>Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is an <lb/>extremely rare diffuse parenchymal lung disease that was <lb/>first described by Beasley et al 1 as a possible variant of dif-<lb/>fuse alveolar damage (DAD), bronchiolitis obliterans with <lb/>organizing pneumonia (BOOP), or eosinophilic pneumonia <lb/>(EP). It is now understood to be a distinct form of lung <lb/>injury that is characterized pathologically by the presence <lb/>of intra-alveolar fibrin and organizing pneumonia in a <lb/>patchy distribution. AFOP has been observed in patients <lb/>with collagen vascular disease, various infections, occupa-<lb/>tional exposures, or adverse drug reactions, 1,2 making it dif-<lb/>ficult to identify clinical characteristics that are specific to <lb/>AFOP. Here we report the first case series of 2 patients who <lb/>developed AFOP following allogenic hematopoietic stem <lb/>cell transplant (HSCT), which suggests AFOP may be more <lb/>common in this patient group than previously recognized. <lb/>Case Report <lb/>Patient 1 <lb/>A 39-year-old Caucasian man with acute B-cell lymphoblas-<lb/>tic leukemia presented 6 weeks after allogenic HSCT. He <lb/>presented with 1 week of cough and fevers with stable vital <lb/>signs and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. <lb/>Pulmonary exam was notable for faint crackles at the right <lb/>apex. Laboratory studies revealed a normal white blood cell <lb/>(WBC) count and differential. Chest X-ray and chest <lb/></body>

It has a variable clinical presentation from <lb/>mild respiratory symptoms to that similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently there is no consensus on <lb/>treatment, and corticosteroids previously were of unclear benefit. To date, there are less than 40 cases of AFOP reported in <lb/>the literature and only one has been linked to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we report the first case series <lb/>of 2 patients who developed AFOP following allogenic stem cell transplant that were successfully treated with high-dose <lb/>corticosteroids. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>AFOP, ARDS, allogenic stem cell transplant, BOOP, diffuse alveolar damage <lb/>Received February 23, 2016.

			<body>computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated bilateral air-<lb/>space opacities (Figures 1-3). <lb/>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of <lb/>the right upper lobe and transbronchial biopsy of the right <lb/>lower lobe were performed on hospital day 2. BAL cell <lb/>count showed 605 WBC/mL with 76% histiocytes, 19% <lb/>polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 6% lymphocytes. <lb/>Bacterial, fungal, viral, and acid fast bacilli studies from <lb/>BAL were all negative. Transbronchial biopsy was nondi-<lb/>agnostic. All other extensive infectious workup was <lb/>unremarkable. <lb/>Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and <lb/>antifungals, the patient had worsening cough, dyspnea, and <lb/>progressive hypoxemia, and therefore underwent surgical <lb/>lung biopsy on hospital day 9 with pathology consistent with <lb/>AFOP (Figure 4). <lb/>Patient 2 <lb/>A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented 25 days after allo-<lb/>genic HSCT for relapsed B-cell lymphoma with persistent <lb/>fevers of 102°F, progressive dyspnea, and cough. His chest <lb/>imaging demonstrated multifocal pulmonary nodules, as <lb/>seen in Figures 5 and 6. <lb/>He underwent bronchoscopy with BAL of the left lower <lb/>lobe; WBC count was 970/mL (4% polymorphonuclear cells, <lb/>41% lymphocytes, 38% histiocytes, and 17% macrophages). <lb/>Bacterial, fungal, viral, and acid-fast bacilli cultures from <lb/>BAL were all negative. The patient underwent a surgical <lb/>biopsy on hospital day 21. Pathologic examination revealed <lb/>diffuse AFOP as well as an acute and organizing stage of dif-<lb/>fuse alveolar damage (Figure 7). Following surgical lung <lb/>biopsy, the patient developed the acute respiratory distress <lb/>syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilatory support. <lb/>Both patients were started on corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg <lb/>of prednisone equivalence with clinical and radiographic <lb/>response (Figure 6). After more than 6 months, both patients <lb/>had full resolution of their pulmonary symptoms and were <lb/>maintained on minimal prednisone doses (&lt;5 mg daily). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>AFOP is an extremely rare pathologic entity with unclear eti-<lb/>ology, vague clinical presentation, and no consensus treat-<lb/>ment with potential deadly consequence. This spectrum of <lb/>disease currently does not fit within the definition of ideo-<lb/>pathic interstital pneumonias based on the American Thoracic <lb/>Society and European guidelines. 3 To make it more confus-<lb/>ing, most reported cases of AFOP have no identifiable risk <lb/>factors, and the diagnosis of AFOP is similar to other forms <lb/>of acute lung injury, often mimicking developing ARDS. Of <lb/>the 17 cases of AFOP reviewed by Beasley et al, 6 cases had <lb/>no identifiable association while the other 11 cases were <lb/>believed to be associated with collagen vascular disease (3), <lb/>amiodarone (1), Haemophilus influenza (1), Acinetobacter <lb/>sp (1), lymphoma (1), and occupational exposures (including <lb/>hairspay, coal mining, construction work, and zoological <lb/>work 1 ). Subsequent case reports since Beasley et al publica-<lb/>tion have linked AFOP to H1N1 infection, undiffentiated <lb/>connective tissue diseases, bone marrow transplant, and <lb/>others. 4,5,6,7 Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, <lb/>cough, and dyspnea. Radiographic findings include bilateral dif-<lb/>fuse migratory alveolar opacities distributed peripherally. 1,2,7,8 <lb/>There are 2 reported patterns of disease progression: a fulmi-<lb/>nant illness with overlapping features of ARDS which car-<lb/>ries a much higher mortality and a more subacute illness with <lb/>spontaneous recovery. 1,9 <lb/>Histologically, the AFOP pattern can be difficult to distin-<lb/>guish from other acute lung injury patterns of DAD, OP, or <lb/>EP, especially on smaller biopsy specimens. Intra-alveolar <lb/>fibrin, a dominant finding in the AFOP pattern, can also be <lb/>seen in DAD, OP, and EP. AFOP pattern differs from DAD, <lb/>OP, and EP by the presence of prominent organizing intra-<lb/>alveolar fibrin, the lack of hyaline membrane, and rare num-<lb/>bers of eosinophils. A surgical biopsy is recommended for a <lb/>diagnosis of the AFOP pattern. The key features of AFOP, <lb/>DAD, COP, and EP patterns are summarized in Table 1. 1,10 <lb/>Currently, there are no established guidelines for the treat-<lb/>ment of AFOP. Compared to OP, AFOP responds less reli-<lb/>ably to steroids and portends a higher mortality rate. Among <lb/>the 17 patients in the Beasley et al 1 study, 7 patients received <lb/>corticosteroids but only one survived. Other immune-modu-<lb/>lators, such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and myco-<lb/>phenolate mofetil, have been used in combination with <lb/>corticosteroids in individual case reports with varying <lb/>degrees of success. 11 ARDS and respiratory failure requiring <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>mechanical ventilation was primarily a predictor of poor out-<lb/>come in the majority of case reports. 1,6 In contrast to the <lb/>other reported cases of AFOP following HSCT who pro-<lb/>gressed and died, our patients had excellent clinical responses <lb/>to corticosteroids. Both patients presented with a subacute to <lb/>acute illness, with patient 2 progressing to respiratory failure <lb/>and ARDS requiring mechanical ventilatory support. <lb/>However, despite having clinical features of ARDS, patient 2 <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>was quickly liberated from mechanical ventilation. The use <lb/>of corticosteroids in ARDS has been controversial and poten-<lb/>tially harmful when given late in the course (&gt;14 days), <lb/>though our patient with AFOP had an excellent clinical <lb/>response to high-dose steroids. Whether the underlying <lb/>pathophysiology of AFOP makes patients more responsive <lb/>to corticosteroids versus patients with infection-associated <lb/>ARDS is unclear. <lb/>We believe that early diagnosis with prompt initiation of <lb/>corticosteroid therapy may explain the excellent clinical <lb/>responses in these AFOP cases. Also, early surgical lung <lb/>biopsy should be considered in ARDS cases following HSCT <lb/>who develop unexplained pulmonary infiltrates with poor <lb/>response to empiric antimicrobial therapy. A biopsy to deter-<lb/>mine if they have AFOP, a condition likely amenable to ste-<lb/>roid therapy, may change the course of treatment. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>AFOP is a rare, relatively new, and distinct histological pat-<lb/>tern of acute lung injury with variable presentation and a <lb/>high mortality. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis is <lb/>essential, including consideration of surgical lung biopsy. <lb/>Treatment with steroids should be considered, despite <lb/>patients presenting with ARDS, if the underlying histologi-<lb/>cal pattern is that of AFOP. To our knowledge, we report the <lb/>first case series of AFOP presenting with hypoxic respiratory <lb/>insuffiency progressing to ARDS following HSCT success-<lb/>fully treated with steroids. <lb/>Figure 4.
