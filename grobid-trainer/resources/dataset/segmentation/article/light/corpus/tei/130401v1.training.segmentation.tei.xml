			<body>Introduction <lb/>Rett Syndrome is a disease associated with loss of function mutations in the gene <lb/>MECP2, which was originally identified as encoding a methylated DNA binding protein 1-<lb/>3 . Patient symptoms include microcephaly, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphia, and <lb/>seizure activity 4,5 . <lb/>Studies in murine models recapitulate many of the patient <lb/>phenotypes and have recently identified a role for MECP2 particularly in inhibitory <lb/>neurons 6-9 . These studies demonstrated that loss of MECP2 can lead to defects in <lb/>transcription 10-12 , dendritic branching 13 , nuclear size 3 , and AKT signaling 14 . <lb/>MECP2 is known to bind methlylated DNA (both 5mC and 5hmC) 1,2,15,16 , and the loss of <lb/>MECP2 was shown to affect 5hmC levels in at least one portion of the murine brain. <lb/>MECP2 has also been described as a transcription factor with specific targets 10,11,13 , <lb/>and more broadly as either a transcriptional activator 14 or repressor 17-20 . However, <lb/>despite decades of research on MECP2, it is still unclear how mutations in this protein <lb/>lead to patient symptoms 3,14,21-23 . To confirm findings made in other models and further <lb/>study these in a human system, some have turned to modeling Rett Syndrome in vitro <lb/>by taking advantage of Disease in a dish approaches. This involves making hiPSCs <lb/>from patient somatic cells, or using genome engineering to introduce mutations into WT <lb/>human pluripotent stem cells. In either case, the pluripotent stem cells created are then <lb/>differentiated toward the neural lineage, and then comparisons can be made between <lb/>cells that express MECP2 or lack it. <lb/>Some of these studies have even taken advantage of isogenically controlled lines to <lb/>identify both transcriptional and electrophysiological effects of loss of MECP2 in human <lb/>in vitro models 14,24 . In the current study, we also sought to mitigate the effect of genetic <lb/>background and variability of differentiation by taking advantage of several isogenic <lb/>lines of hiPSCs that either express the WT allele or the mutant allele leading to cells <lb/>that express or lack MECP2 25 . This allowed for detailed molecular analyses of hiPSCs, <lb/>NPCs and neurons with and without MECP2 under the same genetic background. In <lb/>addition, several lines were made and analyzed in each category to avoid variance in <lb/>differentiation potential amongst isogenic lines. Furthermore, isogenic lines were made <lb/>from two independent patients with different mutations to highlight only those <lb/>phenotypes associated with loss of MECP2 expression and not genetic background or <lb/>variance in hPSC differentiation. Finally, we validated many of these findings using <lb/>siRNA silencing of MECP2 in WT cells of a distinct genetic background. <lb/>In comparing multiple lines of cells, it is clear from our data that loss of MECP2 leads to <lb/>profound molecular alterations specifically towards the ends of chromosomes due to a <lb/>decrease of 5-hydroxymethylation, induction of subtelomeric gene expression, and <lb/>shortening of telomeres. The telomere defects that arise in neurons appear to be <lb/>related to defects in dendritic branching that are a hallmark of the patient disease. <lb/>Together, these results define a heretofore unappreciated role for MECP2 in molecular <lb/>regulation towards the ends of chromosomes. <lb/>Results <lb/>An isogenic model of Rett Syndrome in vitro <lb/>To determine how loss of MECP2 expression leads to defects in the nervous system we <lb/>generated a disease-in-a-dish model using iPSCs. Cognizant of the fact that <lb/>differentiation from hPSCs is highly variable across individual lines, culture conditions, <lb/>and time, we developed an isogenic model to study Rett Syndrome in vitro to remove <lb/>the confound of genetic background 25 . Because female patients with Rett Syndrome <lb/>are usually heterozygous for mutant alleles of MECP2, fibroblasts isolated from these <lb/>patients display a mosaic pattern where roughly half the cells express either the mutant <lb/>or WT allele. This is shown in Figure 1A, where fibroblasts isolated from two patients <lb/>with distinct mutant alleles of MECP2 (R982 and R567) showed that roughly half the <lb/>cells express MECP2 while the other half lacked detectable amounts of this protein. <lb/>One of these mutant alleles is predicted to lead to a premature stop codon, while the <lb/>other leads to failed transcriptional termination. Reprogramming to iPSCs using a small <lb/>set of transcription factors has been shown to happen at the clonal level, such that <lb/>individual reprogramming events in single fibroblasts generate isolated hiPSC clones 26 . <lb/>Therefore, reprogramming of mosaic fibroblast cultures from two different patients <lb/>generated single hiPSC clones that either expressed MECP2 protein or lacked it (Fig <lb/>1B) (Method described in a previous study 27 ). In addition, our work and that of others <lb/>has shown that under standard conditions, the inactive X chromosome in human <lb/>fibroblasts does not reactivate upon reprogramming to the pluripotent state 25,27,28 , which <lb/>is distinct from murine reprogramming 29 . <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Thus, we were able to create multiple lines of hiPSCs with and without MECP2 from <lb/>individual patients and thereby control for differences in genetic background (shown in <lb/>Fig 1B are clones made from patient 982, clones from 567 look similar). The hiPSCs <lb/>generated from fibroblasts of both patients appeared to be unaffected by the lack of <lb/>MECP2, expressed all appropriate markers, and successfully generated teratomas <lb/>upon injection into the testes of immunocompromised mice, consistent with previous <lb/>hiPSC models for loss of MECP2 (Fig 1-figure supplement 1) 14,30-32 . Lack of MECP2 in <lb/>patient-derived cells and specificity of antibody was also confirmed by western blot (Fig <lb/>1-figure supplement 2A). Importantly, we never observed reactivation of the silenced X <lb/>chromosome that would have resulted in re-expression of the WT allele of MECP2 in <lb/>any cultures regardless of differentiation status or passage. This is consistent with <lb/>previous data showing that despite evidence for erosion of isolated portions of the <lb/>silenced X chromosome 33 , the portion containing the MECP2 locus was not affected by <lb/>reprogramming or differentiation. <lb/>As Rett Syndrome primarily afflicts the nervous system and MECP2 is most highly <lb/>expressed in neurons, we first generated neural progenitor cells from all of the hiPSCs <lb/>lines following standard protocols 34 . Across at least two lines per patient with and <lb/>without MECP2, we measured the rate of neuralization, the morphology of NPCs, and <lb/>expression of typical marker genes. We were unable to detect consistent differences in <lb/>these properties between multiple clones of both WT and MECP2-lines derived from <lb/></body>

			<body>both patients (Fig 1C and 1-figure supplement 2B). Furthermore, the growth rate of <lb/>NPCs with and without MECP2 was not consistently different in NPCs made from either <lb/>patient (Fig 1-figure supplement 2C). Next, the NPCs were further differentiated by a <lb/>non-directed differentiation approach that yields both neurons and glia (growth factor <lb/>withdrawal 35 ) (Fig 1D). Both the neurons and glia made from NPCs adopted typical <lb/>morphologies regardless of MECP2 expression, and all NPCs from both patients <lb/>produced neurons and glia at the same rate (Fig 1-figure supplement 2D and figure <lb/>supplement 2E). <lb/>Previous studies have also shown that loss of MECP2 in neurons can lead to a <lb/>decrease in AKT signaling 14 . A similar pattern was observed here in mutant neurons <lb/>generated from Rett patient hiPSCs as measured by phosphorylation of AKT and S6, <lb/>while hiPSCs themselves did not seem to be affected by loss of MECP2 (Fig 1E). <lb/>Dendritic complexity has been shown extensively to be reliant on MECP2 expression in <lb/>various models of Rett Syndrome, and we found a statistically significant decrease in <lb/>complexity in neurons made in the absence of MECP2 by Sholl assay (Fig 1F). In <lb/>addition, we observed qualitative differences in basic neuronal morphology between WT <lb/>and mutant neurons, where the neurons lacking MECP2 had shorter, thicker processes, <lb/>and their soma was not as well defined. <lb/>Loss of MECP2 leads to disruption of hydroxymethylation of DNA <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Because MECP2 is a well-established methylated DNA binding protein particularly for 5-<lb/>hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) 16 , we analyzed patterns of this mark across the genome <lb/>in the presence or absence of MECP2 with Methylation-dependent Immunoprecipitation <lb/>(MEDIP) 41-44 in hiPSCs. We used a stringent criterion to identify differentially <lb/>hydroxymethylated regions (DhmRs), whereby the indicated regions had to differ by 0.2 <lb/>per million reads per base pair (Fig 2A). We still observed a large number of <lb/>differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhmRs) due to the loss of MECP2 in two <lb/>clones each from two independent patients (982.15 and 982.17 vs 982.16 and 982.18; <lb/>567.24 and 567.26 vs 567.25). <lb/>The loss of MECP2 led to many more hypomethylated regions than hypermethylated <lb/>regions, a strong bias that indicated that MECP2 somehow promotes or stabilizes <lb/>hydroxymethylation (Fig 2B). This hypomethylation is more clearly identified by plotting <lb/>the Delta Methylation between the WT and MUT clones from both patients. Both <lb/>patients showed a dramatic shift towards loss of methylation across both clones (Fig <lb/>2B). Mapping 5hmC-DhmRs relative to genomic features indicated a de-enrichment <lb/>away from intergenic regions and enrichment at coding exons (Fig 2C indicated by *). <lb/>When mapping the 5hmC-DhmRs across chromosomal locations, they were highly <lb/>enriched towards the ends of chromosomes (Fig 2D). In addition, the effect of loss of <lb/>MECP2 on 5hmC levels was strong enough to be observed by immunostaining in <lb/>hiPSCs made from both patients (Fig 2E and F). <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>Loss of MECP2 affects the transcriptome of neurons <lb/>It has been suggested that loss of MECP2 only affects gene expression in neurons as <lb/>opposed to the hPSCs and NPCs from which they were derived 14 . Coupled with the fact <lb/>that 5hmC levels appear to be disturbed in MECP2 null hiPSCs, we sought to determine <lb/>whether gene expression was affected in hiPSCs, NPCs or neurons in this patient <lb/>derived in vitro model. We therefore proceeded with RNA seq (&gt;120 million reads per <lb/>sample) of hiPSC, NPC and interneuron cultures. With such sequencing depth, it was <lb/>possible to analyze the RNA-seq reads for the known mutations present in the patients <lb/>from which these lines were made (Fig 3-figure supplement 1). This analysis <lb/>demonstrated that each line studied expressed strictly either the WT or mutant allele of <lb/>MECP2, and that XCI status was unchanged even after extensive differentiation to <lb/>neurons. <lb/>To optimize the search for molecular effects of loss of MECP2 in hiPSCs, NPCs or <lb/>neurons, we generated more defined neuronal cultures by following the newly <lb/>established 3i (three inhibitor) method to create populations of human interneuron <lb/>progenitors (Fig 3-figure supplement 1A) and interneurons (Fig 3-figure supplement <lb/>1B) 45 . <lb/>Interneurons are particularly relevant in the study of Rett Syndrome as <lb/>interneuron-specific deletion of Mecp2 in mice recapitulates many of the disease <lb/>symptoms 6,8,46,47 . We validated the purity and quality of differentiation at each step by <lb/>immunostaining for markers typical of particular cell types (SOX2, SOX1 and NESTIN <lb/>as well as FOXG1 and NKX2.1 for NPCs; and Tuj1, MAP2 and GABA for interneurons) <lb/>in both WT and MUT cultures followed by quantification (not shown). We first assessed <lb/>whether interneurons lacking MECP2 also showed diminished dendritic branching. In <lb/>fact, in patient-derived interneurons made by 3i, defects in dendritic branching as <lb/>measured by the number of endpoints were clearly observed (Fig 3A). <lb/>First, we quantified the expression level of MECP2 in WT cells across these three <lb/>stages of development and found that the average RPKM was 3.1 for hiPSCs, 4.3 for <lb/>NPCs, and 7.75 for interneuron cultures. This is consistent with consensus that MECP2 <lb/>is enriched in neuronal cells, but also demonstrates that it could potentially be relevant <lb/>to hiPSC and NPC physiology as well. However, high stringency analyses (FDR &lt;0.05) <lb/>of the RNA-seq data yielded very few gene expression changes due to loss of MECP2 <lb/>in hiPSCs or NPCs derived from Rett patients (Fig 3B), consistent with Li et al 14 . On the <lb/>other hand, interneuron cultures made from patient 982 showed many gene expression <lb/>changes when comparing two individual WT and MUT clones (Fig 3B). Gene ontology <lb/>analysis uncovered many neuronal physiology-related pathways were downregulated <lb/>due to loss of MECP2 in neurons, while genes associated with extracellular remodeling <lb/>and cell migration appeared to be induced (Fig 3C). <lb/>We then mapped the interneuron DEGs according to chromosomal location and found <lb/>an interesting pattern whereby genes that many of the upregulated genes in the <lb/>absence of MECP2 were enriched towards the ends of chromosomes (Fig 3D). <lb/>Moreover, the same pattern emerged in analysis of low stringency DEGs (p value <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>&lt;0.05) from hiPSCs and NPCs lacking MECP2 (Fig S4C and S4D) for the upregulated <lb/>genes. We did not observe this pattern for the downregulated genes in hiPSCs, NPCs <lb/>and neurons. These data suggested that MECP2 could play a role in gene regulation <lb/>particularly at the ends of chromosomes, and was consistent with the pattern observed <lb/>for hypomethylation of 5hmC in the absence of MECP2. Finally, there was also a small, <lb/>but statistically significant overlap of 5hmC-DhMRs with DEGs in hiPSCs suggesting a <lb/>link between the two (Fig 3E). <lb/>We validated a number of the subtelomeric gene expression changes induced by loss of <lb/>MECP2 by RT-PCR in independent preparations of hiPSCs, NPCs and Neurons (Fig <lb/>4A). Many of the subtelomeric genes upregulated are typically not expressed at all in <lb/>hiPSCs, NPCs or neurons, thus the loss of MECP2 led to an aberrant expression <lb/>pattern as opposed to a reinforcement or suppression of a typical pattern in these cell <lb/>types. Furthermore, the subtelomeric genes that were induced in the absence of <lb/>MECP2 were still typically present at less than 1 RPKM, clouding the potential <lb/>physiological consequence of the induction of these genes. <lb/>To determine whether these effects were specific to the genetic background of the cells <lb/>used or whether defects in reprogramming to the pluripotent state in the absence of <lb/>MECP2 affected the downstream gene expression pattern, we silenced MECP2 in WT <lb/>NPCs and assessed gene expression patterns in this context. Several different siRNA <lb/>targeting oligos were assayed for their ability to silence MECP2 by RT-PCR, western <lb/>blot, and immunostaining (Fig 4-figure supplement 1). Silencing of MECP2 in either <lb/>WT-NPCs derived from other pluripotent stem cells or WT-NPCs derived from 15 week <lb/>old fetal Medial Ganglionic Eminence (MGE) brain tissue, a source of cortical <lb/>interneuron progenitors 35 , led to strong induction of expression of subtelomeric genes <lb/>(Fig 4B and C). <lb/>Recently, it was discovered that a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is also transcribed <lb/>from the subtelomeric domain into the telomeric sequence itself 48-52 . This lncRNA is <lb/>both known to be induced by telomere shortening and to potentially negatively regulate <lb/>telomere length by competing for telomere priming within telomerase 51-53 . TERRA <lb/>transcripts are difficult to detect by RNA-seq because they contain mostly telomeric <lb/>repeat sequences. This also makes it difficult to design PCR primers that are specific to <lb/>a single TERRA transcript. However, we used established RT-PCR primers 51,52 to show <lb/>that, similar to many subtelomeric genes, several TERRAs were strongly induced in the <lb/>absence of MECP2 in isogenic derivatives (hiPSCs, NPCs, interneurons) (Fig 4D). In <lb/>addition TERRA was induced in WT-NPCs derived from pluripotent stem cells or from <lb/>tissue (Fig 4D). <lb/>Loss of TET activity phenocopies loss of MECP2 <lb/>To assess the possibility that MECP2 regulation of 5hmC levels is linked to the <lb/>regulation of subtelomeric gene expression, we targeted TET enzymes by siRNA. TET <lb/>enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and their <lb/>deletion or downregulation is known to severely diminish levels of 5hmC 44,54 . According <lb/>to RNA-seq, the three TET enzymes are expressed similarly in both WT and MUT <lb/>patient neurons (Average RPKM: TET1, 4.1; TET2, 1.6; TET3, 3.6). RT-PCR <lb/>demonstrated the ability to silence TET 1, 2, and 3 isoforms using a combination of <lb/>siRNA oligos in neurons (Fig 4E). Assaying for subtelomeric genes, including TERRA <lb/>transcripts demonstrated that TET inhibition led to strong increases in not only <lb/>subtelomeric coding genes, but also TERRA transcripts (Fig 4F), in a similar manner as <lb/>in loss of MECP2, suggesting a link between 5hmC and subtelomeric gene expression. <lb/>Together, these data confirm that loss of MECP2 can lead to induction of subtelomeric <lb/>genes, including TERRA, and that this dysregulation could be due to an effect on 5-<lb/>hydroxymethylation. Left unclear is how the loss of MECP2 leads to changes in 5hmC <lb/>levels. <lb/>Loss of MECP2 leads to telomeric abnormalities <lb/>One of the most established functions for TERRAs is their ability to interfere with <lb/>telomerase function by acting as a competitive inhibitor for telomere priming 55 , leading <lb/>to shortened telomeres. In addition, others have shown that decreased 5hmC in murine <lb/>embryonic stem cells can also lead to telomere shortening 56 , and, as shown here, loss <lb/>of MECP2 led to decreased 5hmC in hiPSCs (Fig 2). Therefore, we attempted to <lb/>determine the physiological consequence of TERRA induction in the absence of <lb/>MECP2. qPCR for telomere length in fact showed that cells without MECP2 showed <lb/>shorter telomeres, regardless of their stage of differentiation (Fig 5A) (a complete list of <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>cell lines used for these analyses is provided in Supplemental Table 1). NPCs with <lb/>transient siRNA knockdown of MECP2 also showed shorter telomeres, indicating that <lb/>this effect was not simply due to defects during reprogramming or differential expansion <lb/>of cell lines (Fig 5A). Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (qFISH) was used <lb/>to determine telomere length at the single cell level. qFISH demonstrated that NPCs <lb/>without MECP2 showed significantly shorter telomeres relative to centromeric regions <lb/>(Fig 5B). To further validate these findings we performed southern blot with a telomere <lb/>probe on NPCs with and without MECP2 and found telomere shortening in cells lacking <lb/>MECP2 (Fig 5C). <lb/>These data point towards telomere erosion in the absence of <lb/>MECP2. <lb/>Telomere dysfunction is known to be present in some cancers, and also in cells driven <lb/>to senescence due to telomere shortening, but this process has yet to be implicated in <lb/>Rett Syndrome etiology 57-60 . Telomere dysfunction is characterized by short telomeres, <lb/>induction of PML, gammaH2aX, and p53 61 . We assayed for evidence of telomere <lb/>dysfunction by immunostaining for gamma-H2aX (Fig 6A) and PML (Fig 6B) in NPCs. <lb/>WT NPCs with silencing of MECP2 by siRNA and neurons lacking MECP2 also showed <lb/>clear induction of these marks (data not shown), consistent with telomere dysfunction <lb/>induced by the absence of MECP2. <lb/>Induction of P53 and senescence pathways in the absence of MECP2 <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>It is well established that shortening of telomeres puts significant stress on cells, which <lb/>can lead to senescence or even apoptosis 55,62-64 . As Rett Syndrome is caused by <lb/>neuronal defects specifically, we determined how neurons lacking MECP2 respond to <lb/>telomere shortening at the molecular and physiological level. Cells under stress due to <lb/>telomere shortening are known to induce p53, which can then activate various response <lb/>pathways downstream such as DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis 65 . Interestingly, <lb/>p53 induction due to telomere shortening was previously shown to cause defects in <lb/>dendritic branching 64,66 , which is also the dominant phenotype in Rett Syndrome. <lb/>Immunostaining for p53 in neurons with and without MECP2 showed a strong increase <lb/>in p53 protein in the absence of MECP2 (Fig 6C). p21, a transcriptional target gene of <lb/>p53, was also induced in MECP2 null neurons at the protein level (Fig 6C). In addition, <lb/>telomere shortening in NPCs due to overexpression of the Progerin allele, which is <lb/>associated with accelerated aging also induced p53 expression (Fig 6-figure <lb/>supplement 1E). <lb/>Because telomere shortening is known to also drive cellular senescence, we looked for <lb/>signs of defective proliferation in vitro. While attempting to make clones of fibroblasts <lb/>from patients with Rett syndrome, we repeatedly found that clones lacking MECP2 did <lb/>not expand well after a passage (14 MECP2 null clones were created, none expanded), <lb/>while clones expressing the WT allele expanded without problem (42 MECP2+ clones <lb/>were created, and 4 out of 4 all expanded). To determine whether MECP2 null <lb/>fibroblasts encounter senescence, we performed assays to detect endogenous beta-<lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>galactosidase, which is known to be a hallmark of this process 67 . Indeed, MECP2 null <lb/>fibroblasts showed strong activity in this senescence assay (Fig 6D). <lb/>We did not encounter such difficulties with clonal expansion once hiPSCs or hiPSC-<lb/>derived NPCs were made from patients, presumably because during reprogramming, <lb/>telomerase is strongly induced to restore telomere length at least beyond the critical <lb/>threshold 68-73 . In fact, our RNA-seq data showed that hiPSCs made from patients had <lb/>very high expression of TERT, and NPCs still expressed moderate levels, while neurons <lb/>did not express appreciable levels (average RPKM for TERT: hiPSC, 8.8; NPC, 1.6; <lb/>neuron, 0.006). Importantly, the same endogenous galactosidase activity assay on <lb/>interneurons showed a dramatic increase in senescence activity in neurons lacking <lb/>MECP2 (Fig 6E). On the other hand, similar assays on NPCs lacking MECP2 did not <lb/>show any induction of senescence (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that <lb/>loss of MECP2 leads to the generation of neurons that show evidence of telomere <lb/>dysfunction. <lb/>Probing RNA-seq data, we also found that MECP2 null interneuron cultures showed a <lb/>strong increase in a group of genes that are known to be induced by senescent cells, <lb/>known as the Senescence Associate Secretory Program (SASP). Fig 6-figure <lb/>supplement 1A shows that SASP genes were strongly induced in MECP2 mutant <lb/>neurons, providing further evidence of a senescence phenotype. These senescence <lb/>phenotypes are also intriguing in light of the transcriptional data suggesting an increase <lb/></body>

			<body>in aging-related genes by gene ontology analysis (Fig 3C). The only previous report <lb/>linking MECP2 loss to senescence was performed by partial silencing of this protein in <lb/>mesenchymal stem cells, but the results were consistent with those shown here for <lb/>patient derived MECP2 null fibroblasts 74 . <lb/>To demonstrate whether the induction of senescence and p53 observed here was due <lb/>to telomere shortening as opposed to other molecular phenotypes due to loss of <lb/>MECP2, we deliberately shortened telomeres in otherwise wildtype NPCs. We took <lb/>advantage of the progerin allele of the Lamin-A gene. This truncated allele is similar to <lb/>what is found in patients suffering from Progeria, a premature aging disorder typified by <lb/>telomere shortening 75,76 . Induction of the progerin allele by lentiviral infection of cDNA <lb/>in WT NPCs showed a significant telomere shortening as expected (Fig 6-figure <lb/>supplement 1B). In addition, induction of the progerin allele caused an increase in <lb/>expression of the same subtelomeric genes and TERRA transcripts that were induced <lb/>by the loss of MECP2 (Fig 6-figure supplement 1C and D). This was presumably due to <lb/>the Telomere Position Effect, whereby telomere shortening is known to lead to induction <lb/>of subtelomeric gene expression 77,78 . Importantly, progerin expression also led to a <lb/>strong induction of p53 expression (Fig 6-figure 1E), consistent with what was observed <lb/>in MECP2 null neurons. <lb/>Blocking induction of P53 can rescue dendritic branching defects due to loss of <lb/>MECP2 <lb/>Previous evidence from a murine model of telomere shortening as a result of loss of <lb/>telomerase complex (TERT) led to defects in dendritic branching, and this effect was <lb/>strictly dependent on induction of p53 64 . A more recent study also showed that <lb/>experimentally aging the neural lineage with telomerase inhibition led to neurons with <lb/>signs of aging, including reduced dendritic branching 79 . Therefore, we posited that <lb/>inhibition of P53 in MECP2 null neurons with shortened telomeres could potentially <lb/>restore appropriate dendritic branching. <lb/>To determine whether blocking the action of P53 could improve dendritic branching in <lb/>MECP2 null interneurons, we took advantage of Pifithrin-α, a potent inhibitor of P53 <lb/>target gene activation 80 . Treatment of MECP2 null interneurons with Pifithrin-α showed <lb/>evidence of p53 inhibition as measured by RT-PCR for GADD45 65 , a target gene <lb/>important for DNA repair (Fig 6F). After 24-48 hours of p53 inhibition by Pifithrin-α, <lb/>MECP2 null interneurons appeared to adopt an improved neuronal morphology typified <lb/>by increased physical distinction between the soma and neurites, longer, thinner <lb/>neurites, as well as increased dendritic branching as shown and quantified in Fig 6F. <lb/>These data provide evidence that neurons with shortened telomeres due to loss of <lb/>MECP2 respond by inducing P53 activity, which then inhibits the formation of complex <lb/>neuronal processes. In summary, our in vitro model in human neurons suggests that <lb/>loss of MECP2 leads to aberrant molecular regulation at the ends of chromosomes, <lb/>leading to telomere shortening and a resulting induction of cell stress pathways such as <lb/>p53 and senescence (Fig 6G). <lb/></body>

			<body>Rett patient brains show evidence of telomeric dysfunction <lb/>To determine whether any of the phenotypes discovered in this in vitro model of Rett <lb/>Syndrome have relevance to patients afflicted with the disease, we acquired tissue <lb/>specimens from Rett patients and aged matched controls. We first quantified the <lb/>degree of chimerism of female Rett patient neurons due to skewing of X chromosome <lb/>inactivation to determine the relative ratio of neurons that express MECP2 versus those <lb/>that did not. One of the Rett patient brains showed roughly 75% of its neurons lacking <lb/>MECP2, while others appeared to have less than 25% MECP2 null neurons (Fig 7A). <lb/>Southern blotting of the patient brain with 75% mutant neurons compared to an aged-<lb/>matched control demonstrated that this Rett brain had shorter telomeres (Fig 7B). We <lb/>then measured telomere length by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from small <lb/>specimens of brain tissue from a group of Rett patients, and found that some aged <lb/>matched Rett patient brains showed small decreases in average telomere length (Fig <lb/>7C), though not in every case (data not shown). Because of both the limited availability <lb/>of Rett patient brains, and the variable chimerism of WT and MUT neurons within these <lb/>Rett brains, perhaps it is not surprising that we were unable to detect trends across all <lb/>brains analyzed using a method that cannot distinguish between WT and mutant cells. <lb/>This chimerism, coupled with the known variability of telomere length across even <lb/>normal individuals and even across brain regions and cell types precludes an accurate <lb/>assessment of general telomere length differences in Rett brain until more samples <lb/>become available for study. <lb/>On the other hand, we did find that the TERRA transcript was induced in nearly all Rett <lb/>patient brains as measured by RT-PCR (Fig 7D), suggesting that all the Rett patients <lb/>display dysregulation at the ends of their chromosomes. We did identify two Rett patient <lb/>brains with a high proportion of MECP2 null neurons and subjected these to further <lb/>investigation for signs of telomere dysfunction in situ. In patients 1815 and 5784, <lb/>MECP2 null neurons showed a strong increase in both P53 and PML levels compared <lb/>to adjacent neurons that expressed MECP2 (Fig 7E and F). This is consistent with the <lb/>response to telomere shortening due to loss of MECP2 observed in vitro. These data <lb/>are particularly intriguing in light of data showing that telomere shortening diminishes <lb/>dendritic branching in various types of neurons and that this process can be dependent <lb/>on p53 activity 64,66 . <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of MECP2 leads to telomere <lb/>shortening, which in neurons results in clear signs of stress such as H2aX induction, <lb/>p53/p21 induction, and initiation of a senescence program, all of which suggest that <lb/>neurons in Rett Syndrome could be in suboptimal health, leading to neurophysiological <lb/>defects such as dendritic arborization 13,22 . Many of these phenotypes first observed in <lb/>the in vitro model also appeared to be consistent with what could be observed in Rett <lb/>patient brains, suggesting disease relevance for these findings. <lb/>It is curious that telomere defects have not been reported in previous models of Rett <lb/>Syndrome. While one paper suggested that RNAi-mediated silencing of MECP2 could <lb/>affect the telomeres of mesenchymal cells 74 , decades of work on Rett Syndrome have <lb/>not uncovered a role for MECP2 in relation to telomeres in a wide variety of models <lb/>such as various transgenic mouse line, human patient post-mortem analyses, in vitro <lb/>human models. Our study certainly benefited from analyses of multiple isogenically <lb/>controlled cells from two patients and from the single cell analyses of patients with both <lb/>WT and MUT neurons in the same area of the brain. This allowed for high confidence <lb/>comparisons without having to correct for genetic background, or differences in tissue <lb/>preparation. In addition, the study of telomeres in MECP2 mutant mice could be <lb/>hampered by the simple fact that telomeres from inbred mouse strains typically used for <lb/>these studies are on average much longer than human telomeres. Therefore, it is <lb/>possible that telomere shortening in murine models does not proceed to such an extent <lb/>by which one would expect induction of p53 in murine models. <lb/>Patients with Rett Syndrome are typically characterized by a normal development at <lb/>birth and subsequent failure to thrive leading to microcephaly and intellectual disability <lb/>that develops with age. As a result, Rett Syndrome is thought to be caused by <lb/>experience-dependent loss of neuronal function, which would correlate with data <lb/>suggesting that MECP2 regulates activity dependent gene expression 10,13,37 . The <lb/>microcephaly has been proposed to be a function of decreased nuclear size and <lb/>dendritic arborization of affected neurons 13,22 . Could the telomere shortening induced <lb/>senescence described here underlie patient phenotypes? Several studies have looked <lb/>at the effects of telomere shortening specifically in the neural lineage and found <lb/>consistently that shortened telomeres leads to upregulation of p53 and decreased <lb/>dendritic arborization 64,66,81 , a phenotype widely described to afflict MECP2 null neurons <lb/>in vitro and in vivo (Fig 1). <lb/>These results presented here raise the question of whether telomere defects could be <lb/>common to the etiologies of other ID syndromes. The phenotypes described here show <lb/>a striking similarity to those observed in hiPSCs and neural derivatives made from <lb/>patients with Immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies <lb/>syndrome (ICF) Syndrome 82-84 . Two independent studies showed that ICF patient-<lb/>derived hiPSCs displayed subtelomeric hypomethylation, induction of subtelomeric <lb/>gene expression, TERRA induction and telomere shortening that was coupled to <lb/>senescence of somatic derivatives such as fibroblasts. ICF Syndrome only partially <lb/>overlaps with Rett Syndrome in terms of patient phenotypes, but is caused by mutations <lb/>in DNMT3B, a de novo DNA methyltransferase 85 . These findings together are highly <lb/>relevant as DNMT3B is a key de novo methyl transferase to create methylated DNA <lb/>(5mC), which is the substrate for Tet oxigenases to create 5-hydroxmethylated DNA <lb/>(5hmC). Recently, another study showed that deletion of Tet enzymes, which are <lb/>critical to generate the 5hmC mark, led to shortened telomeres 56,86 . Together, these <lb/>studies demonstrate that DNA hydroxymethylation is important in the regulation of <lb/></body>

			<body>telomere length, and our data suggest that MECP2 is potentially an important mediator <lb/>of this effect. <lb/>ATRX-related syndrome shares many phenotypic features with Rett Syndrome (ID, <lb/>seizures, and microcephaly), and the causative gene, ATRX, is known associate with <lb/>MECP2 both genetically as well as biochemically 87-92 . In murine models of loss of <lb/>ATRX, telomere shortening and reduced lifespan are observed 93 . The fact that the <lb/>causative mutations of ICF, Rett and ATRX syndromes are in genes whose products <lb/>are thought to interact in the regulation of DNA methylation and all possess telomeric <lb/>defects suggests that the similarities of patient phenotypes could be the result of <lb/>neuronal response to telomere shortening. This molecular overlap could even form the <lb/>basis of novel therapeutic strategies that either reverse telomere shortening or block the <lb/>response of the cell to telomere defects with agents such as Pifithrin, as shown in Fig <lb/>6F. <lb/>Considering the phenotypes of ICF derived cells, and those of Tet-deleted cells, it <lb/>seems reasonable to suggest that telomere deficiency could be related to intellectual <lb/>disability. In addition, subtelomeric and telomeric dysfunction has been implicated in up <lb/>to 10% of all intellectual disability syndromes 94-96 . Another ID syndrome, Hoyeraal-<lb/>Hreidarsson, is caused by mutations in RTEL1 (regulator of telomere elongation <lb/>helicase 1), a factor that interacts with shelterin complex and is critical for telomere <lb/>elongation 94 . These patients are characterized by low birth weight, microcephaly and <lb/></body>

			<body>immunological dysfunction. Therefore, mutations that specifically result in telomere <lb/>shortening lead to disease phenotypes similar to those found in patients with loss of <lb/>MECP2. As a result, we cannot exclude the possibility that telomere shortening during <lb/>in utero development generates neurons that are less well equipped to deal with post-<lb/>natal stimulation. Furthermore, our analysis of the single male Rett brain specimen <lb/>available to us suggested that brains completely lacking MECP2 also had shorter <lb/>telomeres. <lb/>Another possible interpretation of these data is that instead of a failure to mature, Rett <lb/>Syndrome neurons instead show aspects of premature aging. The fact that MECP2 null <lb/>neurons have shorter telomeres (Fig 5), show induction of aging related genes including <lb/>p53 (Fig 3 and 6), and show senescence (Fig 6) are all consistent with this idea 97 . In <lb/>addition, the fact that WT-NPCs and neurons transduced with the Progerin allele 98 , <lb/>which is known to cause premature aging, show similar phenotypes as neurons lacking <lb/>MECP2 is also consistent with this idea. On the other hand, while Rett patients suffer <lb/>from a post-natal cognitive decline, and long term survivors show phenotypes <lb/>associated with Parkinson&apos;s disease 99 , the typical phenotypes presented in young <lb/>female patients are not consistent with premature aging. Whether the physiological <lb/>response to loss of MECP2 is truly akin to premature aging or whether patients suffer <lb/>from the effects telomere dysfunction that is unrelated to aging is worthy of continued <lb/>investigation. <lb/>Regardless, it is tempting to speculate that treatments that could relieve telomere <lb/>dysfunction or abrogate the p53 mediated stress response could potentially ameliorate <lb/>patient outcomes. Pifithrin-α has already been shown to be an effective treatment to <lb/>restore neuronal function in murine models of injury or stroke 100-102 . Significant future <lb/>effort will be devoted to determining both whether telomere dysfunction is a common <lb/>trigger for ID Syndromes, and whether telomere restoration could potentially help <lb/>patients. <lb/></body>

After 8-12 hours, <lb/>the cells were infected with reprogramming lentivirus that harbors polycystronic human <lb/>Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, cMyc) in DMEM medium containing 10ug/ml of <lb/>polybrene and incubated overnight at 37 o C in 5% CO2 incubator. The following day, the <lb/>viral media was aspirated, replaced with MEF media and cultured for 3 additional days. <lb/>Cells were re-plated on the 5th day onto irradiated MEFs in MEF media. On day 6, the <lb/>culturing media was changed to human ES media containing DMEM/F12 supplemented <lb/>with L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids (NEAA), penicillin-streptomycin, knockout <lb/>serum replacement (Invitrogen), and 10 ng/ml basic FGF.

			<body>For spontaneous terminal neuronal differentiation by growth factor withdrawal, NPC <lb/>cultures were subjected to growth factor withdrawal (removal of EGF and FGF) and <lb/>cultured in basic medium (DMEMF12 + N2 + B27) with three quarter exchange of media <lb/>every three days. Cells were cultured up to weeks. Neural differentiation efficiency <lb/>was analyzed four weeks after growth factor withdrawal by counting the number of cells <lb/>positive for neuronal markers (MAP2 and Tuj1) over the total number of cells visualized <lb/>by DAPI. NPCs were transfected with DCX-GFP reporter one day prior to differentiation <lb/>using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Sholl analysis of DCX-GFP positive neuronal <lb/>neuritis were also measured using ImageJ. All data values were presented as mean +/-<lb/>SEM.

Southern blotting was carried using a TeloTTAGGG <lb/>assay kit (Roche Applied Sciences) following the manufacturer&apos;s protocol with some <lb/>modifications (Kimura et al., 2010). <lb/>Quantitative PCR assay for average telomere length measurement <lb/>Total genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) <lb/>following the manufacturer&apos;s instruction. The concentration and purity of genomic DNA <lb/>were measured using nanodrop spectrophotometers (Thermo Scientific). Fresh <lb/>genomic DNA with high purity (an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8) was used for experiments. <lb/>The integrity of genomic DNA was determined by gel electrophoresis. QPCR was <lb/>performed as previously described (Cawthon, 2002) with further modifications (Jodczyk <lb/>et al., 2015). Briefly, two qPCR reactions were carried using either primers for single <lb/>copy reference gene (albumin) or telomeres at a final concentration of 900nM (See <lb/>Supplementary Table 2 for primer sequences). In each reaction, a standard curve was <lb/>made by serially diluting one reference DNA by 2 fold ranging from 1.56 ng to 50 ng in <lb/>order to ensure the PCR efficiency of 90-100% with the linear correlation coefficient <lb/>greater than 0.98 for each independent experiment. 5ng of sample genomic DNA was <lb/>added in a 384 well plate with a total reaction volume of 15uL.

The stained cells were then imaged at 20x and dendritic arbors of <lb/>individual cells were traced using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin for ImageJ. The <lb/>number of process ends per cell were counted using the Cell Counter plugin for ImageJ. <lb/>Only mature neurons-identifiable by their thin processes and condensed somas-were <lb/>used for analysis. The number of process ends per cell are presented as mean ends <lb/>per cell +/-SEM. Means were compared using the Student&apos;s T-Test for data with two <lb/>groups. A p value &lt;0.05 was used as the cutoff for significance. <lb/>RNA expression profiling <lb/>RNA purification was performed with Qiagen RNAeasy kit following the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>instruction. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturers guidelines using <lb/>The TruSeq V2 kit (Illumina). Microarray profiling was performed with Affymetrix Human <lb/>HG-U133 2.0 Plus arrays as described 106 . For RNA sequencing, the datasets were <lb/>mapped with RASER and HISAT2. The reads were counted per gene. Genes were <lb/>defined by the exon union from the hg19 ensembl annotations. The function of DESeq <lb/>in DESeq2 package was used to first normalize the gene read counts data and then <lb/>identified the differentially expressed genes. The MA plot was generated with the <lb/>function of plotMA in DESeq2 package. Q-value of 0.05 is regarded as the stringent <lb/>cutoff of calling DEGs while p-value less than 0.05 is regarded as the low stringency <lb/>cutoff. For the meta-chromosome plot of DEGs, all the chromosomes (except <lb/>chromosome Y) were first divided equally into 20bins with different length, and then the <lb/>number of DEGs in each bin was counted.

In brief, 25 ng of input genomic DNA or experimental enriched <lb/>DNA were utilized for each library construction. 150-300 bp DNA fragments were <lb/>selected by AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) after the adapter ligation. An Agilent <lb/>2100 BioAnalyzer were used to quantify the amplified DNA, qPCR were applied to <lb/>accurately quantify the library concentration. 20 pM diluted libraries were used for <lb/>sequencing. 50-cycle single-end sequencing reactions were performed. Image <lb/>processing and sequence extraction were done using the standard Illumina Pipeline. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>Bowtie software was used to map the sequenced reads back to the human genome <lb/>(hg19) with the parameter of allowing up to two mismatches. Only the uniquely mapped <lb/>reads were then used to generate the piled-up genome coverage of methylation signals. <lb/>The methylation signals were further normalized by per million mapped reads for <lb/>following analysis. The human genome was then segmented into bins of 1kilo-base <lb/>pairs, which allows for the identification of bins which shows most dramatic methylation <lb/>signals differences between wild-type and mutant samples.

			<body>Figure Legends <lb/>Figure 1. Generation of isogenic model of Rett Syndrome in vitro <lb/>A, Fibroblasts isolated from Rett Syndrome patients (R982 and R567) heterozygous for <lb/>MECP2 mutations exhibit a mosaic pattern of MECP2 expression due to random XCI. <lb/>Note that roughly 50% of fibroblasts from each patient express MECP2. B, Multiple <lb/>isogenic hiPSC lines were produced from patient 982 with a typical Yamanaka protocol <lb/>yielding individual isogenic clones with and without MECP2 expression from the same <lb/>patient, as judged by NANOG and OCT4 staining. C, Specification of 982 patient <lb/>derived hiPSCs towards neural progenitor cells yielded homogenous cultures of NPCs <lb/>with and without MECP2. D, terminal differentiation of 982 patient derived NPCs <lb/>towards neurons and glial by growth factor withdrawal yielded normal neural derivatives <lb/>as measured by immunostaining for MAP2 and GFAP. E, MECP2+ and MECP2-<lb/>hiPSCs and neurons were generated from patient 982 (R982.16 and R982.15) and <lb/>assayed for activity of the AKT pathway by western blot with antibodies that recognize <lb/>the active forms of Akt and its downstream target S6. F, Sholl assay of dendritic <lb/>complexity was performed on WT vs MUT neurons derived from patient 982. Increased <lb/># of branch points indicates increased dendritic complexity, measured as a function of <lb/>distance from the cell body. *p value &lt; 0.05 according to student&apos;s t test. Bar graphs <lb/>represent mean +/-SEM. <lb/>Figure 2. Hypomethylation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in MECP2 null cells <lb/>A, The overall delta methylation signal distribution is shown. The cutoff was made <lb/>based on the difference of 0.2 per million reads per base pair. B, Number of differential <lb/>5hmC regions (DhmRs) are presented as either gain of 5hmC (hypermethylated) or loss <lb/>of 5hmC (hypomethylated) in each patient line, comparing MECP+ clones to MECP2-<lb/>clones. Differential hydroxymethylation pattern between clones from 982 and 567 shows <lb/>the overall delta-methylation as hypomethylation. C, Localization of DhmRs within <lb/>various genomic features relative to the portion of those features in the genome. The <lb/>highest concentration of DhmRs was found in coding exons (light green). D, Mapping <lb/>DhmRs across metachromosomes representing the relative location across all <lb/>chromosomes shows an increase in DhmRs towards the ends of chromosomes. The y-<lb/>axis represents the differences of normalized methylation signal (piled-up signal per <lb/>million mapped reads) between wild-type and mutant. E, Immunostaining for 5hmC in <lb/>hiPSC clones from patients 982 and 567 indicated that levels of this DNA methylation <lb/>mark are considerably lower in MECP2 null hiPSC clones. F, 5hmC staining was <lb/>quantified in hiPSCs derived from both patient 567 and 982. *p value &lt; 0.05 according <lb/>to student&apos;s t test. Bar graphs represent mean +/-SEM. <lb/>Figure 3. Loss of MECP2 is associated with differential gene expression <lb/>particularly in neurons. <lb/>A, Immunostaining neurons generated from patient 982 for TuJ1, a neuronal-specific <lb/>marker. Right, quantification of dendritic complexity by counting endpoints shows a <lb/>significant difference between neurons with and without MECP2 made from patient 982. <lb/>B, Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hiPSCs, NPCs and <lb/>Neurons shows that loss of MECP2 has a profound effect on gene expression in <lb/>neurons. C, Gene ontological analysis of DEGs increased versus decreased in MECP2 <lb/>null neurons. D, DEGs were mapped to a metachromosome to determine their relative <lb/>location across chromosomes. In general, upregulated DEGs were enriched towards <lb/>the ends of chromosomes, while downregulated DEGs showed no clear pattern of <lb/>location. E, DEG and DhmRs are statistically significantly overlapped in hiPSCs. This <lb/>analysis was performed by randomly select the same number of genes with iPSC FDR <lb/>DEG from the hg19 genes, then calculating the overlapping with hmC DMRs in a <lb/>permutation test performed 5,000 times. The permutated number of overlapping genes <lb/>is shown in the parentheses. <lb/>Figure 4. Loss of MECP2 leads to induction of subtelomeric genes including <lb/>TERRA, a long non-coding RNA <lb/>A, RT-PCR for subtelomeric genes in hiPSCs, NPCs and neurons derived from <lb/>patients. B, RT-PCR for subtelomeric genes in WT NPCs with silencing of MECP2 by <lb/>siRNA. C, RT-PCR for subtelomeric genes in WT brain tissue derived NPCs with <lb/>silencing of MECP2 by siRNA. D, RT-PCR with the same samples described in A, B <lb/>and C for TERRA transcripts. E, Silencing of TET expression by siRNA was assessed <lb/>by RT-PCR. F, Knockdown of TET followed by RT-PCR for TERRA transcripts and <lb/>subtelomeric genes also showed that loss of 5hmC is associated with induction of <lb/>subtelomeric gene expression. In this figure, all data presented are the resulting relative <lb/>fold change differences found in at least three biologically independent experiments.

C, <lb/>Immunostaining for p53 and p21, a target of p53, showed an increase of these stress <lb/>markers in MECP2 null neurons derived from patient 567. D, Cells undergoing <lb/>senescence show upregulation of endogenous b-galactosidase activity. Clones of <lb/>fibroblasts lacking MECP2 showed strong b-gal activity, while those of WT fibroblasts <lb/>did not. E, The senescence assay applied to neuronal cultures showed a strong <lb/>increase in the absence of MECP2.
