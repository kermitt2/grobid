			<body>We appreciate and thank Drs Saitz and Serefoglu for their positive <lb/>and sympathetic words on our article. 1 Indeed, our genetic studies <lb/>have shown that 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, 5-HT 1A receptor gene <lb/>polymorphism and 5-HT 2C receptor gene polymorphism are associated <lb/>with the duration of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time in men <lb/>with lifelong premature ejaculation. In line with the remarks, 1 we <lb/>hope that our stopwatch method will be used by other investigators <lb/>to investigate the role of serotonergic gene polymorphisms on the <lb/>duration of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time. But lifelong <lb/>premature ejaculation is not only characterized by persistent short <lb/>intravaginal ejaculatory latency times, inability to delay ejaculation <lb/>and negative personal consequences. Recently, lifelong premature <lb/>ejaculation is characterized by an acute hypertonic state with facilitated <lb/>ejaculation (ejaculatio praecox), together with either facilitated erections <lb/>(erectio praecox) and/or facilitated penile detumescence (detumescentia <lb/>praecox). 2 Future research is required to answer the question whether <lb/>this combination of symptoms is associated with polymorphisms of <lb/>various serotonergic gene and other neurotransmitter gene systems. <lb/></body>
