Few studies, however, have <lb/>investigated variance itself as a trait under genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the <lb/>effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing <lb/>to phenotypic differences among individuals 1,2 . To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic <lb/>variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of Drosophila inbred lines 3 and focused on locomotor <lb/>handedness 4 , in an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high <lb/>levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree <lb/>of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic <lb/>variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in <lb/>handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a implicated a neuropil in the central complex 5 of <lb/>the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration <lb/>and locomotor coordination 6 . We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible <lb/>RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it <lb/>shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variability. Because <lb/>traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current <lb/>methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype. <lb/>Keywords: Drosophila, behavior, handedness, variability, vQTL, Tenascin accessory, Ten-a, heritability, DGRP <lb/>Abbreviations: DGRP: Drosophila Genome Reference Panel; ANOMV: Analysis of means for variance; QTL: <lb/>quantitative trait loci, GWAS: genome wide association study, MAD: median absolute deviation.

Under this models, intragenotypic <lb/>variability is assumed to be attributable to non-genetic <lb/>environmental perturbations 1 . There is however, growing <lb/>evidence for the importance of genetic control of variance 2,7,8 <lb/>and that variance itself is a quantitative trait.

			<body>genetic variation on trait means. As a result, the mechanisms by <lb/>which variable phenotypes arise from a uniform genetic <lb/>background are still poorly understood, particularly in the <lb/>context of behavior, where variability may be a critical <lb/>determinant 14,15 . Most recently with the advent of genome-wide <lb/>association studies, several groups 7,8,16,17 have mapped <lb/>quantitative traits loci affecting variance (vQTLs) by comparing <lb/>phenotypic variances among individuals that share genotypes. <lb/>These studies examine the average effect of QTL alleles across <lb/>genetic backgrounds and heterogeneous environmental across <lb/>individuals 18 , in the process losing any specific effects intrinsic <lb/>to each individual. <lb/>Here, we examine diversity that is typically hidden in population <lb/>averages, by examining phenotypic variability among <lb/>individuals with the same genotype. This is the variation that we <lb/>would observe if we could generate a large number of copies of <lb/>individuals of the same genotype in a common environment, and <lb/>measure a trait across them (an experiment for which isogenic <lb/>lines 2,9-11,18 are especially suited). In this case phenotypic <lb/>differences among genetically identical individuals result from <lb/>subtle micro-environmental perturbations and stochasticity in <lb/>development, while differences in variability among genotypes <lb/>reflects genetic differences in developmental stability 11 . While <lb/>intragenotypic variability contributes to phenotypic variation in a <lb/>population, this source of variation is not usually estimable <lb/>because, with few exceptions, each individual in an outbred <lb/>diploid population possesses a unique instance of its genotype. <lb/>As a consequence we have little understanding of the causes and <lb/>consequences of inter-individual intragenotypic variability. It <lb/>nevertheless has wide ranging implications. In evolutionary <lb/>biology, variability offers an adaptive solution to environmental <lb/>changes 19,20 . In medical genetics, diseased states emerge beyond <lb/>a phenotypic threshold, and high variability genotypes will <lb/>produce a larger proportion of individuals exceeding that <lb/>threshold than low variability genotypes, even if they have the <lb/>same mean. While intragenotypic variability has been discussed <lb/>in animal behavior, particularly in the context of the emergence <lb/>of personality 14,21 , to date no genes have been associated with <lb/>behavioral variability that do not also affect the mean. <lb/>To study this problem, we used a panel of Drosophila inbred <lb/>lines where, for each line, we can phenotype a large number of <lb/>individuals of the same genetic background, age, and rearing <lb/>environment. This allowed us to empirically estimate the <lb/>magnitude of intragenotypic variability. Specifically, we <lb/>measured the locomotor behavior of flies walking freely in Y-<lb/>shaped mazes 3 , focusing on the variability in locomotor <lb/>handedness (left-right turning bias). The precision and high-<lb/>throughput nature of our assays allows a large number of flies to <lb/>be measured per genotype and permits robust estimates of the <lb/>sampling error on variance itself. We tracked two hours of <lb/>locomotor behavior of 110 individuals (on average) from each of <lb/>159 lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) <lb/>in a randomized block design. For each individual fly, we <lb/>recorded the time and left-right direction of each turn in the <lb/>maze (Fig 1a), estimating a turn bias score as the fraction of <lb/>turns that were to the right. Flies performing more than 50 turns <lb/>were analyzed, and completed 413 turns per trial on average. <lb/>We began by comparing the mean turning bias and found no <lb/>significant genetic variation across lines (Supplementary Fig <lb/>1). In other words, averaged across individuals within a line, <lb/>each lines are unhanded, making an equal proportion of left and <lb/>right turns. We verified the lack of genetic variation for turning <lb/>bias within lines by crossing pairs of males and females with <lb/>matched turning biases (e.g., two strongly right-biased parents). <lb/>For all crosses, the phenotypic mean and variance of the <lb/>distribution of the F1 generation was statistically <lb/>indistinguishable from the distribution of the parental line <lb/>(Supplementary Fig 2). Handedness therefore provides an ideal <lb/>framework to study the genetics of variability because genetic <lb/>effects on variability are not confounded by mean effects. Next, <lb/>using parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (bootstrapping) <lb/>statistical approaches, we compared levels of intragenotypic <lb/>variability across lines and found highly significant among-line <lb/>differences in variability, implying that the abundance of <lb/>individuals that were either strongly left-or right-biased was <lb/>itself variable among lines. This indicates that the degree of <lb/>intragenotypic variability itself is under genetic control in these <lb/>lines (Fig 1b, Supplementary table 1). In order to obtain <lb/>further evidence that intragenotypic variability is heritable, we <lb/></body>

Cyan and <lb/>yellow highlighted dots are significant at p &lt; 0.001 based on non-<lb/>parametric bootstrap. c. Distributions of turning bias across individuals <lb/>for three representative DGRP lines with low, intermediate and high <lb/>intragenotypic variability. Each dot represents the turning bias of a <lb/>single fly within that line. Lines are beta distribution fits, chosen <lb/>because they model over-dispersed binomial distributions. <lb/>mated two high-variance and two low-variance lines to each <lb/>other and measured turning bias in the resulting progeny <lb/>(phenotyping an average of 183 individuals per cross). <lb/>Intercrosses between high-variance lines led to high variance F1 <lb/>progeny and crosses with low-variance lines yielded low <lb/>variance F1 progeny (Fig 2, Supplementary table 1). In both <lb/>cases the variability in the F1 progenies was statistically <lb/>indistinguishable from that of the parents. <lb/>It is conceivable that some lines might be better than others at <lb/>buffering microenvironmental perturbations, in which case the <lb/>degree of intragenotypic variability among lines would be <lb/>correlated across traits. To test this possibility, we scored <lb/>additional phenotypes from our Y-maze data, namely, the total <lb/>number of turns (a measure of overall activity); the mutual left-<lb/>right information between successive turns; and the regularity of <lb/>turn timing. We also analyzed other phenotypes previously <lb/>measured on the DGRP (starvation resistance 22 , chill coma <lb/>recovery 22 , startle response 22 , and night sleep 23 ). We found <lb/>significant genetic variation for variability in all these <lb/>phenotypes, confirming that genetic control of variability is <lb/>ubiquitous across phenotypes. On the other hand, we found no <lb/>evidence that the variances of these traits are correlated across <lb/>phenotypes (with the sole exception of mean absolute deviation <lb/>(MAD) of turn bias and turn timing regularity) (Supplementary <lb/>Fig 3). This suggests that the genetic basis for intragenotypic <lb/>variability is trait-specific (and implicates many independent loci <lb/>controlling this often-ignored trait). <lb/>The DGRP lines have been fully sequenced 22 , allowing for <lb/>whole-genome association mapping using the variability (i.e. <lb/>MAD) of turning bias as a trait. While the DGRP is <lb/>underpowered to study the architecture of complex traits due to <lb/>the relatively small number of lines (n=159 in this study), it is a <lb/>good resource to identify candidate genes for experimental <lb/>follow up 3,24 . To that end, we performed an association study <lb/>using a series of locus-specific mixed linear models (accounting <lb/>for relatedness between lines as well as experimental block <lb/>effect) and found 36 polymorphisms in 22 genes associated with <lb/>variability in turning bias using a nominal p-value 3,22 of 5 x 10 -6 <lb/>(Supplementary table 2). These genes are strongly enriched for <lb/>expression in the central nervous system both in adults and in <lb/>larvae (adult CNS enrichment in adult FET p &lt; 0.001 and in <lb/>larvae FET p &lt; 0.01, data from FlyAtlas 25 ) (Supplementary Fig <lb/>4). Among these, the synaptic target recognition gene Tenascin <lb/>accessory (Ten-a, GWAS p &lt; 3 × 10 -6 ) (Fig 3a) caught our <lb/>attention, Ten-a is a transmembrane signaling protein involved in <lb/>synapse formation 26,27 , critical to the development of the brain <lb/>central complex 5 (a brain structure implicated in sensory <lb/>integration and locomotion 4-6,28 ) and is highly conserved from <lb/>insects to mammals 29 . In order to validate the role of Ten-a in <lb/>modulating variability in turning bias, we used a null allele (Ten-<lb/>a cbd-KS9635 ), a deficiency overlapping Ten-a (Df(1)Ten-a 26 ), and <lb/>expression knock-down using RNAi (UAS-TRiP.JF03375 30 ). In <lb/>all cases, disrupting Ten-a increases the variability in turning <lb/>bias with no effect on the mean (Figs 3b,c and 4). The effect of <lb/></body>

Error bars are +/-one standard error <lb/>estimated by bootstrap resampling. <lb/>RNAi knock-down suggests a quantitative relationship between <lb/>Ten-a mean expression and variance in turning bias. <lb/>The bias in handedness of a given fly is a fixed property of that <lb/>individual (e.g. a young adult with a strong left bias will display <lb/>this bias throughout its life 4 ). This suggests that handedness may <lb/>be wired during development. To determine if there is a critical <lb/>developmental period when Ten-a expression is required to <lb/>regulate variability, we used temperature-inducible RNAi to <lb/>knock down Ten-a in sliding 3-day windows (Fig 4a and b). We <lb/>found that knocking down Ten-a expression in mid-pupae <lb/>increases the resulting adults&apos; variability (Fig 4d). This stage <lb/>coincides with a spike in Ten-a expression 31,32 (Fig 4c) and the <lb/>formation of the central complex 5 . Further, Buchanan et al 4 <lb/>mapped a set of neurons within the central complex (i.e. <lb/>protocerbral bridge columnar neurons) that regulates the <lb/>magnitude of left-right turn bias, and therefore the magnitude of <lb/>intragenotypic variability. <lb/>Our use of inbred lines allowed us to estimate a parameter <lb/>(intragenotypic variability) that otherwise could not be observed <lb/>and uncovers the spectrum of phenotypes a given genotype can <lb/>produce. Because all phenotypic variation in handedness in a <lb/>population is (surprisingly) attributable to intragenotypic <lb/>variability, it highlights the importance of genetic control of <lb/>variability. The significance to medical genetics is far-reaching, <lb/>specifically for attempts to predict phenotype from genotypes <lb/>(e.g., &quot;missing heritability 33 &quot;). Within evolutionary biology, this <lb/>is significant for understanding evolutionary trajectories or <lb/>forces maintaining polymorphisms 9,19,34 . An individual drawn <lb/>from a high-variability genotype has the potential to explore a <lb/>wider range of phenotypic space than one with a low-variability <lb/>genotype (far beyond what may be determined by the mean <lb/>effect alone, Supplementary Fig 5). This could be advantageous <lb/>in evolutionary adaptation, but in human genetics it could be <lb/>deleterious when an extreme phenotype enhances disease risk. <lb/>Recent progress in single-cell technology18 now makes it <lb/>possible to measure cell to cell variation within an individual <lb/>genotype, enabling the study of intragenotypic variability in <lb/>human phenotypes such as drug response and cancer <lb/>progression. This study adds to an emerging body of work <lb/>suggesting that in order to understand variation in complex <lb/>traits, we must also understand the contribution of intragenotypic <lb/>variability. <lb/></body>

It consists of a collection of <lb/>isofemale lines derived from a single field collection from the <lb/>Raleigh NC farmers market, followed by 20 generations of full-<lb/>sib mating that rendered most loci homozygous within lines <lb/>(expected F= 0.986 22 ). As a result, the genetic variation that was <lb/>present between individual flies in the natural population is now <lb/>captured between lines in the panel. This allows us to measure <lb/>any phenotype on a given genotypic background and phenotype <lb/>the same genotype a large number of times in any environment. <lb/>Completion of the genome sequencing for all lines combined <lb/>with Drosophila&apos;s generally rapid decay in linkage <lb/>disequilibrium between polymorphic sites makes the DGRP a <lb/>powerful tool to identify genetic polymorphisms that affect <lb/>quantitative phenotypes 3 . The DGRP lines are available from the <lb/>Drosophila Stock Center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu). We <lb/>used a total of 159 lines in this study (lines with the highest <lb/>inbreeding coefficient -list is provided along with data at: http:// <lb/>lab.debivort.org/genetic-control-of-phenotypic-variability. Stock <lb/>used for Ten-a validation: Berlin-K, central-body-defect KS96 28 , <lb/>Df1-Ten-a 5 , and RNAi TRiP.JF03375 30 <lb/>All flies were reared on standard fly media (Scientiis and <lb/>Harvard University BioLabs fly food facility), in a single 25°C <lb/>incubator at 30-40% relative humidity with a 12/12h light/dark <lb/>cycle. Before each assay flies were fully randomized across: <lb/>blocks, lines, Y-maze arrays and position on the array. At least 3 <lb/>strains were assayed simultaneous on each array. <lb/>Variance, variation, variability: <lb/>The similarity between concepts of variance, variation and <lb/>variability may lead to some confusion. The meanings of these <lb/>terms are reviewed in Wagner and Altenberg 40 . In accordence <lb/>with their definition, we used the terms variance 2,18 to describe <lb/>the standard statistical dispersion parameter (σ 2 ) or estimates of <lb/>it derived from observations (s 2 ). Variability refers to the <lb/>potential of an organism or genotype to vary phenotypically. <lb/>Variation refers to the realized (observable) differences between <lb/>individuals or genotypes. <lb/>Phenotypic assay <lb/>Studying variance as a trait poses a number of challenges <lb/>including: the large sample size required (precise estimates of <lb/>variance requires a larger number of observations than needed to <lb/>estimate means), the experimental design (as to not confound <lb/>sources of error), and potential measurement error of the <lb/>phenotype itself 18 . It is with these considerations in mind that we <lb/>developed a high throughput assay aimed at monitoring the <lb/>behavior of individual flies placed into individual Y-mazes 4 (Fig <lb/>1.a). Each experiment examines one array of 120 Y-mazes <lb/>(refered to as maze-arrray). Mazes were illuminated from below <lb/>with white LEDs (5500K, LuminousFilm), imaged with 2MP <lb/>digital cameras (Logitech), and the X-Y positions of each fly&apos; <lb/>centroids were automatically tracked and recorded with software <lb/>custom written in LabView (National Instruments). Further <lb/>details about the assay are provided in 4 , code available at http:// <lb/>lab.debivort.org/neuronal-control-of-locomotor-handedness/. <lb/>While various statistics can be computed to estimate the degree <lb/>of variability of a distribution, in this study we use one the most <lb/>robust metrics, the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) 8,17 . It is <lb/>defined as the median of the absolute deviation from each <lb/>observation&apos;s median: MAD = median (|Xi -median(Xi)|). <lb/>Where Xi is the phenotypic score of an individual fly within a <lb/>line. MAD scores were computed for each line for each <lb/>phenotype. <lb/>Only females were used in this experiment and only lines <lb/>yielding data from a minimum of 75 individuals were included. <lb/>Before each assay flies were very lightly anesthetized, rapidly <lb/>transferred to an individual Y-maze and given a recovery period <lb/>of 20 minutes before the start of the assay. Fly behavior in the <lb/>mazes was monitored for two hours. This assay generated four <lb/>phenotypes: (1) The handedness or left/right turning bias in the <lb/>arms of the maze summed over all L/R decisions. A turning bias <lb/>score of 0.8 for a given fly would indicate that this individual <lb/>made left turns 80% of the time at the maze&apos;s junction over the <lb/>two hour period. This simple phenotype is particularly well <lb/>suited for this study given that it is measured without error and <lb/>the high number turns for any given fly ensure a robust estimate <lb/>of the turning bias and it variance for each fly. (2) The number of <lb/>turns over the 2 hour period, an estimate of overall locomotor <lb/>activity. (3) The &quot;switchiness&quot; or the mutual left-right <lb/>information between successive turns right/left turn sequence <lb/>(e.g. LLLLLRRRRR: low switchiness, high mutual information; <lb/>LLRLLRRRLR: moderate switchiness, low mutual information; <lb/>LRLRLRLRLR: high switchiness, high mutual information) <lb/>defined as: <lb/>(N⟨L,R⟩+N⟨R,L⟩)/(2NRNL/N) <lb/>where N⟨L,R⟩ is the number of left turns followed by right turns, <lb/>N⟨R,L⟩ is the number of right turns followed by left turns NR is the <lb/>number of right turns, NL is the number of left turns, and N is the <lb/>total number of turns. (4) The regularity of turn timing: a fly <lb/>with a high score makes turns uniformly throughout the <lb/>experiment while a low score would characterize a fly making a <lb/>small number of dense streaks of turns but is inactive for dozens <lb/>of minutes at a time. It is defined as MAD(ITIs)/(7200/N) where <lb/>ITIs is the vector of inter-turn intervals in seconds. The left/right <lb/>turning bias is the main focus of this study, additional traits were <lb/>measured to illustrate that the degree of variability across traits <lb/>is not correlated between lines. <lb/>Quantitative genetic analysis <lb/>Analysis of Means: In order to determine if there was genetic <lb/>variation segregating in the DGRP affecting the mean turning <lb/>bias, we partitioned the variance for line means using the <lb/>ANOVA model: <lb/>Y = µ + Lrandom+ Brandom + L*B random + A + X + A*X + e <lb/></body>

Lines in which the MAD of <lb/>the resampled group was closer to the MAD of the pooled data, <lb/>in fewer than 10 of 10,000 resamples, were taken as significant. <lb/>This tests the null hypothesis that each group is drawn from an <lb/>identical distribution of observations, using MAD as a test <lb/>statistic. (3) A nonparametric version of the Analysis of Mean for <lb/>Variances (ANOMV) 37,38 . This approach compares the group <lb/>means of the Median absolute deviation MAD to the overall <lb/>mean MAD under the null hypotheses that the group MAD <lb/>means equals each line specific MAD. Implemented in SAS <lb/>9.3 37 . (4) Finally we used the same ANOVA model described <lb/>above for the analysis of mean but used the absolute deviation <lb/>from the median 8,9 as a measure for each fly as the dependent <lb/>variable. Implemented using PROC MIXED in SAS 9.3. <lb/>Phenotypic correlation between traits: We assesed 4 traits as <lb/>measured in this study and 4 additional traits gathered from the <lb/>literature (standard deviation for starvation, startle response, <lb/>chillcoma recovery 3 , coefficient of environmental variation for <lb/>night sleep 23 ). Phenotypic correlation between traits was <lb/>computed as the pearson product-moment correlation. P-values <lb/>are not corrected for multiple comparison. Implemented using <lb/>PROC GLM in SAS 9.3. <lb/>High and low variance lines intercrosses <lb/>In order to confirm that variability was heritable, we crossed <lb/>respectively high and low variability lines to each other. We <lb/>crossed high variability lines 45 to lines 105 and low variability <lb/>lines 796 to 535. 10 females and 5 males were used for each <lb/>cross. Flies were reared and phenotyped using the same <lb/>protocoled described above. Note that parental behavior was re-<lb/>measured concurrently with F1 behavior following a <lb/>corresponding self-cross (e.g. 45 x 45). We assessed statistical <lb/>significance between parental lines and their progeny using the <lb/>Brown-Forsythe test and a bootstrapping two-tailed z-test (with <lb/>n = 10,000 resamples). We resampled the turn bias of the parents <lb/>and for each iteration calculated the MAD of turning bias then <lb/>compared the MAD for the F1 progeny to their parents. <lb/>Genome wide association mapping <lb/>GWAS was performed using the code and approach decribed in 22 <lb/>(dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu). In a first step phenotypic stores were <lb/>adjusted for the potential effect of Wolbachia and known large <lb/>inversions segregating in this panel (namely: In(2L)t, In(2R)NS, <lb/>In(3R)P, In(3R)K, and In(3R)Mo) none of them were associated <lb/>with variability turning bias. We then fitted a series of loci <lb/>specific mixed linear model using the model: <lb/>Y = µ + Sb + Iu + e <lb/>Where Y is the MAD of turning bias of each DGRP lines, S is <lb/>the design matrix for the fixed SNP effect b, I is the incidence <lb/>matrix for the random polygenic effect u, and e is the residual 22 . <lb/>A total of 1,931,250 SNPs and indels were used in this analyses <lb/>with the minor alleles present in at least 7 DGRP lines, using <lb/>only biallelic sites. Polymorphisms segregating within lines were <lb/>discarded and for each SNP a least 60 DGRP lines had to have <lb/>been genotyped to be analyzed. Given the number lines available <lb/>in the DGRP, GWAS will generally be underpowered 24 , however <lb/>our goal is not to describe the overall genetic architecture of <lb/>each of these phenotypes, rather we seek to identify interesting <lb/>candidate genes that would provide some insight into the genetic <lb/>basis of variance control. For this reason we used a liberal <lb/>threshold of p &lt; 10 -6 . <lb/>The analysis for tissue enrichment was based on FlyAtlas data <lb/>which are publically available 39 . For each tissue, we used <lb/>FlyAtlas AffyCalls 25 to determine which genes were expressed <lb/>in which tissue (using a conservative filter of four out four <lb/>present calls). To determine significance we used a Fisher exact <lb/>test comparing the expected number of gene expressed in each <lb/>tissue across the entire genome to the observed number of gene <lb/>expressed in each tissue in our gene list. <lb/>Validation of Ten-a effect on variability: <lb/>Ten-a null and deficency: The turning bias and MAD turning <lb/>bias of homozygotes of both the null allele Ten-a cbd-KS963 5 and <lb/>deficiency overlapping Ten-a Df(1)Ten-a 6 where compared to <lb/>heterozygous animals over their genetic background, Berlin-K. <lb/>Time course knockdown of Ten-a RNAi: Ten adult Ptub-<lb/>Gal80ts;Ptub-Gal4/Sb females were crossed to three UAS-Ten-a <lb/>RNAi y1,v1;P(TRiP.JF03375)attP2 males for RNAi induction. <lb/>Flies were allowed to mate for 24 hours at 20°C at which point <lb/>the parents were passaged out and the bottles containing F1 eggs <lb/>were returned to 20°C until the beginning of their heat shock <lb/>window. Flies were exposed for 72 hours to 30°C temperature, <lb/>in 72 hour sliding window each day over 14 windows (fig 4a). <lb/>All flies assayed were between three and five days post-eclosion. <lb/>In parallel, each day developing flies of the same genotype were <lb/>examined and counted to determine the fraction of flies in each <lb/>developmental stage at the time of RNAi induction (fig 4b). <lb/>Stages containing larval animals were microwaved to melt the <lb/>media, poured through a sieve and larval carcasses counted <lb/>under a dissecting scope. Controls were performed using Ptub-<lb/>Gal80ts;Ptub-Gal4/Sb females crossed to Canton-S males and <lb/>C a n t o n -S f e m a l e s c r o s s e d t o U A S -Te n -a R N A i <lb/>y1,v1;P(TRiP.JF03375)attP2 males (fig 4d), otherwise treated <lb/>identically. <lb/>Ten-a expression: Data for Ten-a expression over developmental <lb/>time (Fig 4c) were downloaded from FlyBase 32 and derived from <lb/>ModEncode 31 (modENCODE DDC ids: modENCODE_4433, <lb/>_4435 and _4439 through _4462).

Visual representation of the effects of variance on the prevalence of phenotype exceeding a threshold, such as a disease. Genotype 1 <lb/>and 2 differ in their degree of intragenotypic variability. The sets of circles at left represent the range of possible outcomes for each genotype. <lb/>Generally, each individual in an outbred diploid organism is a unique instance of its genotype. By contrast, our experiments with inbred lines allow <lb/>us to consider multiple individuals from the same distribution.
