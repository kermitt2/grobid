In this study the internal current <lb/>densities J ϕ (azimuthal direction) and J z (axial direction) have therefore been spatially and <lb/>temporally resolved in the bulk plasma region above a cylindrical magnetron using Rogowski <lb/>coils. From the measurements a phenomenological model has been constructed describing the <lb/>evolution of the current density in this pulsed plasma. The core of the model is based on three <lb/>different types of current systems, which characterize the operating transport mechanisms, <lb/>such as current transport along and across magnetic field lines. There is a gradual change <lb/>between these current systems during the initiation, build-up and steady state of a HiPIMS <lb/>plasma. Furthermore, the data also show that there are spatial and temporal variations of the <lb/>key transport parameter J ϕ /J z , governing the cross-B resistivity and also the energy of the <lb/>charged particles. The previously reported faster-than-Bohm cross-B electron transport is <lb/>verified here, but not for all locations. These results on the plasma dynamics are essential input <lb/>when modeling the axial electric field, governing the back-attraction of ionized sputtered <lb/>material, and might furthermore provide a link between the different resistivities reported in <lb/>HiPIMS, pulsed-DC, and DC magnetron discharges. <lb/>(Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version) <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>High power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) <lb/>introduced by Kouznetsov et al in 1999 [1] is a promising <lb/>technique for improving magnetron sputtering used in many <lb/>industrial processes for thin film deposition [2]. The HiPIMS <lb/>discharge generates a highly ionized plasma with large <lb/>quantities of energetic metal ions [3] due to very high pulse <lb/>power densities with, in some cases, a directed flux of charged <lb/>species [4]. The high degree of ionization of the sputtered <lb/>species has several advantages for thin film growth, such as <lb/>an increased density [5] and adhesion [6], in particular for <lb/>complex-shaped surfaces [7, 8], and a decreased deposition <lb/>temperature [9]. <lb/>The high potential applied to the magnetron in a HiPIMS <lb/>discharge generates large internal currents in the plasma <lb/>between the sputtering cathode and the anode (often the <lb/>chamber walls and the ground shield of the magnetron). Large <lb/>azimuthal currents, circulating in the magnetic field trap close <lb/>to the target surface, also arise due to the presence of the <lb/>magnetic field [10]. Measurements by Bohlmark et al [11] <lb/>show that the ratio between the azimuthal Hall current density, <lb/>J H , and the cross-B discharge current density, J D⊥ , in a typical <lb/>HiPIMS process is surprisingly low, meaning a high speed in <lb/>the electron transport across the magnetic field lines during <lb/>the HiPIMS discharge. This so-called anomalous transport <lb/>is known to also affect the transport of ions in this type <lb/>of discharge [4] and has recently been investigated in more <lb/></body>

			<body>detail using electric probes [10] to estimate the azimuthal <lb/>current, J ϕ . From these studies it was concluded that the <lb/>current density ratio was typically J ϕ /J D⊥ ≈ 2. This value <lb/>is significantly lower than what is expected from classical <lb/>theory of diffusion and electrical conductivity using collisions <lb/>to move electrons across the magnetic field, or even Bohm <lb/>diffusion seen in common direct current magnetron sputtering <lb/>(DCMS) [10]. Expected values for the Bohm regime is <lb/>in the range 8 &lt; J ϕ /J D⊥ &lt; 30 [12, 13]. Moreover, in a <lb/>recent series of experiments and simulations [10, 14] it was <lb/>proposed that the anomalous transport could be described <lb/>as being mediated by highly nonlinear waves, likely due <lb/>to the modified two-stream instability (MTSI), resulting in <lb/>electric field oscillations in the MHz-range. Furthermore, the <lb/>ratio J ϕ /J D⊥ can in the magnetron geometry be identified <lb/>with the more general Hall parameter ω ge τ EFF [10]. Here <lb/>ω ge is the electron (angular) gyrofrequency and τ EFF is the <lb/>effective electron-ion momentum transfer time. In a study by <lb/>Brenning et al [15] analyzing three different types of pulsed <lb/>plasma discharges (including HiPIMS) of different magnetic <lb/>geometries, as well as covering several orders of magnitude <lb/>in plasma density, it was found that the faster-than-Bohm <lb/>anomalous transport is present in all cases and is expressed by <lb/>ω ge τ EFF = 2.7 within a factor of 2. This gives an approximate <lb/>faster-than-Bohm transport range 1.5 &lt; ω ge τ EFF &lt; 5.5. <lb/>In summary, previous investigations have provided <lb/>important insights into understanding the mechanism behind <lb/>the anomalous transport, but still it is likely that the same pulsed <lb/>discharge can undergo different transport types in different <lb/>parts of the plasma as well as during different stages of <lb/>the pulse. In order to fully understand the transport of the <lb/>energetic charged particles it is necessary to both spatially <lb/>and temporally resolve what type of transport mechanism that <lb/>operates in the HiPIMS discharge. In this study the current <lb/>densities J ϕ and J z have therefore been directly measured <lb/>using Rogowski coils, which, unlike electrical probes, require <lb/>no further information regarding the plasma characteristics in <lb/>order to determine the current flowing in a particular direction. <lb/>The current density ratio, J ϕ /J z , has also been calculated <lb/>and is here presented for different locations in the plasma as <lb/>well as for different times during the pulse. Above the race <lb/>track the magnetic field is approximately parallel to the target, <lb/>J z ≈ J D⊥ , and the measured current density ratio gives the <lb/>Hall parameter: J ϕ /J z ≈ J ϕ /J D⊥ = ω ge τ EFF . <lb/>2. Experimental details <lb/>The experiments were carried out using a standard, circular, <lb/>slightly unbalanced, planar magnetron source equipped with <lb/>a high-purity copper (Cu) target with a diameter of 0.150 m. <lb/>The magnetic null point is located about 0.10 m from the target <lb/>surface and the target race track is approximately located at ρ = <lb/>4.5 cm. A complete description of the magnetic field topology <lb/>of the present magnetron setup has been given by Bohlmark <lb/>et al [11]. The magnetron (cathode) was located inside <lb/>a stainless steel vacuum chamber (height 0.70 m, diameter <lb/>0.44 m). The chamber walls and the ground shield of the <lb/>magnetron served as an anode for the discharge. The base <lb/>Figure 1. Voltage and current characteristic for a typical HiPIMS <lb/>discharge pulse used in the study. <lb/>pressure was maintained around 1.33 × 10 −4 Pa using a turbo <lb/>molecular pump. Argon with a minimum purity of 99.9997% <lb/>was used as a discharge gas and introduced into the chamber <lb/>through a mass flow controller. The argon pressure was kept <lb/>constant at 0.53 Pa. <lb/>Unipolar pulses were applied between the cathode (target) <lb/>and the chamber walls using a HiPIMS Sinex 3 (Chemfilt <lb/>Ionsputtering AB, Sweden) power supply capable of delivering <lb/>2000 V and 1200 A peak values. In this work pulses up <lb/>to approximately 800 V and 145 A were used with a pulse <lb/>duration of 200 µs and a repetition frequency of 100 Hz, as <lb/>seen in figure 1. <lb/>In this work Rogowski coils [16] were used for measuring <lb/>the current density (see figure 2). The probe consists of a <lb/>helical coil of wire with the lead from one end returning through <lb/>the center of the coil to the other end, so that both terminals are <lb/>at the same end of the coil in order to eliminate contributions <lb/>from external components of the current. The Rogowski <lb/>coil has no ferromagnetic material in the core, which means <lb/>that the coil cannot be driven into saturation and therefore <lb/>responds linearly to extremely large currents [17]. Being of <lb/>low inductance it can also respond to very high frequency <lb/>pulses, and thus making it suitable as a plasma diagnostics tool <lb/>in HiPIMS discharges. The probe was mounted on a movable <lb/>metal rod for scans taken at different axial (z) as well as radial <lb/>(ρ) positions. In this work z = 0 marks the target surface and ρ <lb/>is measured from the center axis of the target. The center of the <lb/>probe torus was chosen to define the probe position. The probe <lb/>was never moved closer than z = 4 cm in order not to disturb <lb/>the plasma discharge, which was verified by continuously <lb/>recording the discharge characteristics (the voltage and current <lb/>curves) and only using data from probe positions where these <lb/>were not influenced as the probe was moved toward the cathode <lb/>surface. The probe and rod could be rotated in order to measure <lb/>directional currents. In the present investigation the axial as <lb/>well as azimuthal current profiles were determined in the region <lb/>4 z 8 cm and 0 ρ 7.5 cm assuming axial symmetry. <lb/>Data were collected at 1 cm intervals in the axial direction and <lb/>at four different points in the radial direction (ρ = 0, 2.5, <lb/>4.5, 7.5 cm), constituting a total of 20 different locations in the <lb/>plasma. <lb/></body>

Schematic of the geometry of the internal windings of a <lb/>Rogowski probe used in the experiments displaying the copper wire <lb/>wound around a rigid non-magnetic core made of PVC plastic and <lb/>attached to a ceramic tube. The copper wire has been back wound <lb/>and fed through the ceramic tube. R = 21.5 mm is the outer radius <lb/>and r = 9.7 mm is the inner radius of the probe. Before mounting <lb/>the probe in the chamber the torus was covered with a thin layer of <lb/>epoxy glue (torr-seal). Finally a thin layer of copper was deposited <lb/>on the probe as an electrostatic shield. <lb/>A Rogowski coil produces a voltage signal [16] given as <lb/>V coil = <lb/>nAµ 0 <lb/>2πr <lb/>dI <lb/>dt <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where n is the number of turns, A is the cross-sectional area <lb/>for each turn, r is the major radius of the coil torus and I is <lb/>the current through it. The probe signal is integrated to yield <lb/>the current as function of time. It is not possible to measure <lb/>DC currents with this type of probe, since the voltage that is <lb/>induced in the coil is proportional to the rate of change of the <lb/>current. <lb/>In the present experiments a Rogowski coil, where the <lb/>shield had inner radius of 9.7 mm and outer radius of 21.5 mm, <lb/>was inserted into the plasma (figure 2). The current density <lb/>was obtained from the measured total current by assuming <lb/>an effective collection radius of 15.6 mm, with an estimated <lb/>error of 50% due to the uncertainty of how the current pattern <lb/>is influenced by the probe: deflected around the probe torus, <lb/>or compressed into it. In order to estimate the accuracy of <lb/>the recorded current densities the total axial current flowing <lb/>across a disk at z = 4 cm (0 <lb/>ρ <lb/>7.5) was measured <lb/>and compared with the discharge current. It cannot be proven <lb/>certain that a measurement at this distance captures the full <lb/>discharge current, but it was the best option with respect to <lb/>stable plasma discharge conditions since, at probe position <lb/>closer to the target than 4 cm, the discharge voltage and current <lb/>characteristics were influenced. From the comparison of the <lb/>absolute values it was found that they are of the same order <lb/>within a factor of two given the assumed current collection <lb/>area of the probe, and thus in line with the assumed uncertainty. <lb/>The only exception is toward the end of the pulse, where the <lb/>recorded probe current is slightly higher. This deviation is <lb/>addressed in section 3.2 regarding the analysis of the different <lb/>current systems. Still it must be pointed out that it is not the <lb/>absolute values in this type of discharge, but the topology <lb/>of the current density distribution which is the focus of the <lb/>present investigation. For these we only need to assume that <lb/>the effective collection area of the probe is not dependent on <lb/>direction. Conclusions regarding the current patterns, as well <lb/>as the J ϕ /J z ratio, are therefore less uncertain than the absolute <lb/>values. <lb/>The probe winding consisted of 0.2 mm copper wire <lb/>around a rigid plastic toroidal core making up a total of 470 <lb/>turns. The probe was calibrated several times throughout the <lb/>whole series of measurements by recording a known sinusoidal <lb/>current running through the center of the probe together with <lb/>the probe output. The probe signal was later integrated and <lb/>manually fitted to the current signal. From the calibration it <lb/>was concluded that the probe provided very good accuracy up <lb/>to 1 MHz, and thus meeting the experimental requirements. <lb/>The inductance of the probe was found to be approximately <lb/>0.66 µH, which was calculated based on the given probe <lb/>dimensions. Furthermore, careful precautions were taken to <lb/>minimize the system noise, which meant adding additional <lb/>shielding to cables from the turbo pump as well as control <lb/>units. In this way the maximum noise level was found to <lb/>be less than 5% by measuring the probe signal inside the <lb/>chamber with no other process running during operation. Basic <lb/>plasma parameters such as target voltage and target current as <lb/>well as the probe signal were monitored and recorded on a <lb/>Tektronix TDS2004B oscilloscope. A Tektronix P6015 high <lb/>voltage probe measured the target voltage. The current was <lb/>measured with a Chauvin Arnoux C160 current probe. All <lb/>signals recorded were averaged over 128 measurements to <lb/>ensure better statistics. <lb/>3. Results and discussion <lb/>3.1.

These maps are given in figures 4(a)-<lb/>(e), where the letter stands for the same point in time as seen <lb/>in table 1. The left panel is the measured J ϕ , the middle <lb/>panel represents J z , and the right panel is the current density <lb/>ratio J ϕ /J z . Since the color coding varies between these <lb/>current density plots, they have for clarity been provided with a <lb/>scale factor in the upper left corner indicating the approximate <lb/>current density increase compared with figure 4(a). Given <lb/>below is first a description of the currents measured during the <lb/>HiPIMS discharge, which is followed by an analysis of the <lb/>internal current system. <lb/>Following the time evolution of the internal currents it is <lb/>seen in the middle panel of figure 4(a) that only small axial <lb/>currents are flowing above z = 4 cm during the initial part of <lb/>the HiPIMS discharge (t &lt; 30 µs). From the J z plot at 30 µs <lb/>it can be concluded that most of the current is transported from <lb/>the center and outer edges of the magnetron to the nearest <lb/>anode point along the magnetic field lines and that little axial <lb/>cross-B transport is present above the race track region. At the <lb/>same time a clearly distinguished azimuthal current is flowing <lb/>in a torus 5 cm above the target race track. This is in line with <lb/>electron density measurements by Bohlmark et al [18] on the <lb/>same system, where they recorded a toroidal-shaped density <lb/>increase at the same time and place. Also, in a previous study <lb/>on Hall currents using the same setup (but a Ta target) it was <lb/>measured that, in the early phase of the discharge (at 16 µs), <lb/>J ϕ reached values around 10-20 kA m −2 at 4-6 cm above the <lb/>target race track for 5-6 times the discharge current (∼300-<lb/>350 A) compared with the present investigation (60 A) [11]. <lb/>The left panel of figure 4(a) shows slightly less than a quarter <lb/>of that value, which is consistent with our lower discharge <lb/>current. Moreover, it is seen that further away from the cathode <lb/>surface (z &gt; 6 cm) both J ϕ and J z are of the same magnitude, <lb/>indicating that here is a region of much larger cross-B transport <lb/>(i.e. lower Hall parameter ω ge τ EFF ). <lb/>At the peak of the discharge current (t = 60 µs) the <lb/>azimuthal current is fully developed and reaches values around <lb/>22 kA m −2 above the target race track (figure 4(b)), which is <lb/>a tenfold increase compared with t = 30 µs. J z has now also <lb/>developed in the region above the target race track, although <lb/>it only amounts to about twice the increase in magnitude in <lb/>comparison with t = 30 µs. If assuming that most of the <lb/>current at this stage in the pulse runs in the azimuthal direction <lb/>in a plasma torus (inner radius 3.5 cm and outer radius 7.5 cm) <lb/>with its center located just below z = 4 cm and with the <lb/>above given current density, then the total azimuthal current <lb/>is approximately 28 A, which is roughly 20% of the discharge <lb/>current. <lb/>After t = 85 µs J z is found to increase faster than J ϕ , as <lb/>seen in figures 4(c) and (d), meaning that there is a comparably <lb/>lower Hall parameter ω ge τ EFF in this time interval, which will <lb/>be further analyzed in section 3.3. J ϕ still preserves the <lb/>characteristic toroidal current flow, which is further expanded <lb/>in space as the internal current densities reach a second <lb/>maximum at t = 130 µs seen in figure 4(e). J ϕ above the <lb/>race track at z ≈ 4 cm is found to be more than ten times <lb/>larger than J z . <lb/>In figures 4(a)-(e) of J z two current-intense areas can be <lb/>identified: (1) at z ∼ 4 cm and ρ ∼ 0 cm as well as (2) at <lb/>z ∼ 4 cm and ρ ∼ 7.5 cm. These must be mainly field-aligned <lb/>currents J , since the magnetic field lines at these locations <lb/>run almost perpendicular to the magnetron surface, as can be <lb/>seen in figure 5. In order to study the edge effects of the cross-<lb/>B electron transport it is therefore necessary to investigate <lb/>the radial component of the current density distribution. Only <lb/>above the target race track, where a large part of the cross-B <lb/>current is carried, J ϕ /J z ≈ ω ge τ EFF is valid, and will be used <lb/>in the analysis below. <lb/>Another way of illustrating the measured current density <lb/>dynamics from ignition, via peak to decay of the HiPIMS <lb/>discharge, is to look at the net current flow across the different <lb/>boundaries of the investigated cylindrical volume (4 <lb/>z <lb/>8 cm and 0 <lb/>ρ <lb/>7.5 cm). These currents have been <lb/>calculated from the data in figures 4(a)-(c) using Kirchhoff&apos;s <lb/>current law and are given in figure 5 as a percentage of the <lb/></body>

The block arrows show the total current I <lb/>across the indicated surface (i.e. not the current density J ). <lb/>A few things can be noted: (1) during the rise of the pulse, <lb/>most of the discharge current crosses the B-field radially and <lb/>close to the target surface (z &lt; 4 cm). As the pulse evolves, <lb/>this fraction decreases dramatically (only 12% at t = 85 µs). <lb/>(2) Cross-B current transport across the lower disk (z = 4 cm, <lb/>0 ρ 7.5 cm) is not detected during the rise of the pulse but <lb/>grows to be the dominant fraction of the measured total current <lb/>as the discharge decay phase is reached (88% at t = 85 µs). <lb/>(3) There is a radial current reversal between 60 and 85 µs <lb/>across the cylinder surface (4 <lb/>z <lb/>8 cm, ρ = 7.5 cm), <lb/>which is analyzed in more detail in the next section. <lb/>3.2. Analysis of the current system in the bulk plasma <lb/>Analysis of the data in figures 4(a)-(c) shows that the internal <lb/>currents in the volume of the discharge go through a sequence <lb/>of configurations during the pulse. We propose that this <lb/>complex time evolution be suitably analyzed in three types of <lb/>current systems, called I, II (subdivided into IIa, IIb, IIc) and <lb/>III that are shown in figure 6 and summarized in table 2. It will <lb/>be shown that a suitable superposition of these current systems <lb/>can describe the internal current dynamics for any given time <lb/>during the HiPIMS discharge. <lb/>We propose that that the redistribution of currents <lb/>observed in figure 5 can be understood in terms of the current <lb/>systems of figure 6 as follows: <lb/>(1) Each current pulse starts with an ignition phase during <lb/>which there is negligible plasma in the bulk volume of <lb/>the vessel. Since the vacuum electric field is strongest in <lb/>the vicinity of the anode ring of the magnetron, this is a <lb/>natural place of ignition, beginning as a localized glow <lb/>discharge close to the target surface. Without plasma in <lb/>the bulk volume, the electrons can in this ignition phase <lb/>only go in a current system of type I to the anode ring. <lb/>This is why there is a strong radial current close to the <lb/>target surface during the rise of the HiPIMS pulse, as seen <lb/>in figure 5(a). <lb/>(2) The next phase is the bulk plasma breakdown. Secondary <lb/>electrons, and electrons created in the ionization region <lb/>close to the target, are accelerated out along the magnetic <lb/>field into the bulk volume and begin to ionize the neutral <lb/>gas. When the bulk plasma density has built up sufficiently <lb/>to admit current closure across B at high z, a current <lb/>system of types IIa-IIc is added to the overall current <lb/>distribution (figure 5(b)). At 30 µs, type IIa carries 20% <lb/>of the discharge current (see figure 5(a)). In the current <lb/>system types IIa and IIb, the transport of electrons along <lb/>B should be associated with two J z current maxima at <lb/>z ≈ 4 cm: one around ρ = 0 cm and another around <lb/>ρ ≈ 8 cm, where the magnetic field lines are aligned in <lb/>the z direction. Both J z maxima are clearly present in the <lb/>experimental data (middle panel of figure 4(a)). <lb/>(3) The final phase is establishing a steady state. As can <lb/>be seen in the middle panels of figures 4(a)-(e) there <lb/>is a transition in J z from the above-described maxima <lb/>at the center and edge of the target (types IIa and IIb <lb/>in figure 6(b)) to a more evenly distributed axial current <lb/>density (t <lb/>85 µs), indicating an increased cross-<lb/>B transport above the race track (types IIc and III). <lb/>Eventually, approaching the steady state, a type III current <lb/></body>

It might be <lb/>that both the azimuthal and the cross-B current are increasingly <lb/>concentrated in the region above the race track because the <lb/>plasma density still rises there. Similar double peak structures <lb/>were observed by Bohlmark et al [11] when investigating time-<lb/>dependent variations of the magnetic field on the same device. <lb/>The authors ascribe this phenomenon as related to an interplay <lb/>between the electric field (−z) and the plasma pressure (+z), <lb/>where the electric field is strongly reduced in the decay phase <lb/>of the HiPIMS pulse, and thereby causing an expansion of the <lb/>dense plasma torus. <lb/>3.3. Current ratio <lb/>The spatially resolved current density ratio J ϕ /J z is shown <lb/>in the right hand panels of figures 4(a)-(e). The reason for <lb/>investigating this ratio is the previously discussed anomalous <lb/>cross-B transport of electrons, which has been described in <lb/>several earlier works [4, 10, 12, 14, 15]. A short summary of <lb/>this particular transport mechanism is given below to facilitate <lb/>the discussion of the results that follow. <lb/>In the HiPIMS plasma the classical resistivity, governing <lb/>the transport properties, is modified by the existence of a <lb/></body>

			<body>plasma instability [10], driven by the azimuthal current. The <lb/>correlation between oscillating n e and E ϕ results in azimuthal <lb/>forces of opposite sign on the electron and ion populations. <lb/>Macroscopically, this is equivalent to an anomalous cross-B <lb/>resistivity, η ⊥ = n e E ϕ /(J ϕ n e ) [4]. The effective electron <lb/>momentum transfer time, often called the effective electron <lb/>collision time, τ EFF , is related to the cross-B resistivity through <lb/>η ⊥ = <lb/>m e <lb/>τ EFF e 2 n e <lb/>= <lb/>B <lb/>ω ge τ EFF en e <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where the electron angular gyrofrequency is written as ω ge = <lb/>eB/m e [19]. In the magnetron geometry, the product ω ge τ EFF <lb/>can be found from a macroscopic measurement of the current <lb/>density ratio J ϕ /J D⊥ = ω ge τ EFF (where it is assumed that <lb/>J D⊥ is carried by electrons) [12, 14]. This means that a low <lb/>ratio of J ϕ /J D⊥ (or equivalently a low ω ge τ EFF ) is the result <lb/>of increased transverse resistivity and thereby increased cross-<lb/>B conductivity and diffusion of electrons. As mentioned in <lb/>the introduction, earlier estimates of J ϕ /J D⊥ in magnetrons <lb/>show values that are around 2 in HiPIMS [10, 11] and in the <lb/>range 8-30 in DCMS discharges [12, 13]. The estimates in <lb/>HiPIMS discharges are, however, based on assumptions about <lb/>the spatial distribution of J z over magnetic flux surfaces, and <lb/>furthermore are time averages around the time of the discharge <lb/>current maximum. Through the use of the Rogowski probe <lb/>these limitations have been overcome and the first time and <lb/>space resolved current density ratios are here presented. As <lb/>described above, the current density measurements cover only <lb/>J ϕ and J z (not J r ), and ω ge τ EFF can only be obtained above the <lb/>race track region, where the magnetic field is parallel to the <lb/>target surface. <lb/>Figure 8 shows J ϕ /J z above the race track for times 30, <lb/>60, 85, 100 and 130 µs based on the results in the right panels <lb/>of figures 4(a)-(e). The following observations can be made: <lb/>(1) there are small variations in time, where the values stay <lb/>within a factor of two from the average indicated by a solid <lb/>line. The lowest ω ge τ EFF values are found at the times of <lb/>the transition regions of the internal current measurements, <lb/>i.e. points (a), (c) and (d) in figure 3 (t = 30 µs , 85 µs <lb/>and 100 µs respectively). (2) There is a systematic spatial <lb/>variation. Only around z ∼ 7-8 cm are the earlier reported <lb/>low values ω ge τ EFF ≈ 2 recovered. Closer to the target, <lb/>ω ge τ EFF increases with decreasing z and values approaching the <lb/>Bohm range are found. (3) A comparison with the magnetic <lb/>field strength B(z) shows that ω ge τ EFF scales approximately <lb/>as 1/B, as expected from classical collisions with constant <lb/>τ EFF . However, classical collisions (also plotted for reference <lb/>in figure 8) are over the whole range of z and at all times about <lb/>a constant factor of 8 too infrequent. Further analysis of this <lb/>topic is postponed until we have a firmer experimental basis, <lb/>including measurements of the J r component. <lb/> 4. Conclusions <lb/>The internal current densities J ϕ and J z have been successfully <lb/>measured in a HiPIMS discharge using Rogowski coils. From <lb/>the spatially and temporally resolved data it is seen that the <lb/>current density evolution can be characterized by a gradually <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>Bohm <lb/>super-Bohm <lb/>Bohm <lb/>super-Bohm <lb/>J <lb/>ϕ /J <lb/>z <lb/>J <lb/>ϕ /J <lb/>z <lb/>Figure 8. Measurements of J ϕ /J z ≈ ω ge τ EFF above the race track, at <lb/>the times (a)-(e) (figure 4). The curve marked (a) is the average of <lb/>the experimental data.

The <lb/>Coulomb collision rate is based on the measurements by <lb/>Sigurjonsson of T e and n e [20].

Also <lb/>the mechanisms of current transport along as well as across <lb/>magnetic field lines are covered in the present description. <lb/>Furthermore, the current density ratio, J ϕ /J D , has also been <lb/>calculated due to its importance for characterizing the cross-B <lb/>electron transport in these types of discharges. It was found that <lb/>faster-than-Bohm cross-B electron transport is operating in <lb/>the HiPIMS discharge, in particular during the internal current <lb/>transient regimes for z &gt; 6 cm, whereas Bohm diffusion is <lb/>approached for z &lt; 5 cm. <lb/></body>
