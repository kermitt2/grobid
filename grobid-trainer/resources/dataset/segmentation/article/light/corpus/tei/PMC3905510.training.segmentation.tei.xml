			<body>Introduction <lb/>ADHD is a sustainable pattern of inattention <lb/>,hyperactivity and impulsed behavior, which can <lb/>have harmful consequences for the patients&apos; social <lb/>life. It was called childhood hyper-kinetic reaction <lb/>before. It is estimated that 3 to 5 percent of <lb/>children show the symptoms in primary school. 1 <lb/>In addition to the role of genetic factors in the <lb/>incidence of this mental disorder, family <lb/>imbalance and other anxiety factors play a role in <lb/>the continuity of the disorder. 2 <lb/>Conduct disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 10 <lb/>percent is a prevalent disorder in primary schools, <lb/>similar to ADHD. It is 4 to 12 times more frequent <lb/>among boys compared with girls. <lb/>Children with mixed ADHD have more risk <lb/>factors compared with controls and children with <lb/>ADHD inattentive type and also their families <lb/>have more adversity compared with families of <lb/>ADHD, inattentive type children and control. 3 <lb/>Conduct disorder is a stable set of behaviors <lb/>characterized by aggression and violating other&apos;s <lb/>rights. It is associated with many other disorders <lb/>including ADHD and is also related to several <lb/>mental and social factors such as harsh parenting, <lb/>family problems and lack of parental supervision. <lb/>Many parents of children with conduct disorders <lb/>have serious mental problems. In addition, the <lb/>increased prevalence of drug abuse and <lb/>dependency has a role in the incidence of conduct <lb/>disorder. 2 Piffiner et al reported that the <lb/>association of conduct disorder and ADHD is <lb/>significantly related to lack of family supervision, <lb/>negative and non-effective behavior and the <lb/>father&apos;s antisocial personality. 4 <lb/>Studies have shown that 51% of children with <lb/>bipolar parents have psychiatric disorders and <lb/>most of them have MDD, ADHD and behavioral <lb/>disorders. 5 Moreover, other studies have reported <lb/>a 13% prevalence of ADHD in children of drug-<lb/>dependent parents and a 8% prevalence in <lb/>cocaine dependent parents. 6 <lb/>Children with ADHD, which is commonly <lb/>associated with conduct disorder, causes <lb/>dysfunction in the family and parent-child <lb/>relationship, and reduces the effective role of <lb/>parents, increases the stress level and other <lb/>psychiatric problems in the family. 7 On the other <lb/>hand, children with ADHD in a four-year follow-<lb/>up showed development of BMD if they had a <lb/>family history of this disorder. 2 Considering the <lb/>negative impact of parents&apos; drug dependency and <lb/>bipolar disorder, the present study aimed to <lb/>determine the prevalence of ADHD and conduct <lb/>disorder in children of parents with drug <lb/>dependency or bipolar disorder. <lb/>Methods <lb/>In this case-control study, the case group <lb/>consisted of patients with drug dependency and <lb/>bipolar disorder hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti <lb/>Hospital in Kerman who had children in the age <lb/>range of 7 to 11 years. The controls consisted of <lb/>healthy individuals with no drug dependency or <lb/>any psychiatric disorder who had children in the <lb/>same age range. The sample size was about 100 <lb/>in three groups of parents with bipolar disorder, <lb/>parents with drug dependency and the control <lb/>group, considering α = 5% and the standard <lb/>deviation of conduct disorder and ADHD scores, <lb/>which was 1.250 in previous studies and d=0.16. <lb/>The sample selection continued as far as possible <lb/>to make an equal number of boys and girls <lb/>including in each group. <lb/>Exclusion criteria were mental retardation in <lb/>either parents or children, neurological and <lb/>chronic somatic diseases. Furthermore, in the <lb/>drug dependency group, patients with BMD, in <lb/>the BMD group patients with drug dependency <lb/>and in the control group patients with either <lb/>drug dependency or BMD were excluded. <lb/>Diagnosis of drug dependency and bipolar <lb/>disorder was based on DSM-IV-TR which was <lb/>carried out by two psychiatrists and a <lb/>psychiatric assistant. Data were collected using <lb/>Rutter&apos;s scale for assessing behavioral problems <lb/>Form A (parents&apos; form) and a demographic <lb/>questionnaire. <lb/>Reliability and validity of this questionnaire <lb/>has been investigated in Iran. 8 This <lb/>questionnaire includes 31 components including <lb/>health related issues, habits, and 18 statements, <lb/>which have three levels of answers of &quot;not <lb/>correct&quot;, &quot;correct to some extent&quot; and <lb/>&quot;completely correct&quot; and the scores for them are <lb/>zero, one and two, respectively. The maximum <lb/>total score for this questionnaire is 62 and the <lb/>total score of 13 or higher is the cut off point <lb/>showing behavioral disorder. <lb/>Diagnosis in this questionnaire includes conduct <lb/>disorder, emotional disorder, non-distinctive and <lb/>normal. A Rutter score of higher than 13, but equal <lb/>scores of conduct disorder and emotional disorder is <lb/>called non-distinctive disorder. <lb/></body>

			<body>Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Chi-<lb/>square and Tamhane&apos;s post-hoc test. SPSS 11.5 was <lb/>used for this purpose. <lb/>Results <lb/>Abnormal Rutter scores was generally 11.7%, <lb/>14% and 6.1% in children of drug dependent <lb/>parents, bipolar parents and healthy parents, <lb/>respectively and there was no significant <lb/>difference between them. The frequency of <lb/>hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder and <lb/>emotional disorder in children is presented in <lb/>Table 1. There was no significant difference <lb/>between conduct disorder and ADHD in girls <lb/>and boys of each group. Table 2 shows the <lb/>frequency of hyperactivity and conduct <lb/>disorders in bipolar, drug dependent and <lb/>healthy parents considering mothers&apos; smoking <lb/>during pregnancy. There was no significant <lb/>correlations <lb/>between <lb/>smoking <lb/>during <lb/>pregnancy and the frequency of ADHD and <lb/>conduct disorder in any of the groups. <lb/>According to the results, the mean of <lb/>hyperactivity raw scores in bipolar and drug <lb/>dependency groups were significantly different <lb/>from those of healthy groups (P = 0.001 and <lb/>P = 0.006, respectively), but there was no <lb/>significant difference between the bipolar and <lb/>drug dependent groups in this regard. <lb/>Regarding the frequency of conduct disorder <lb/>between children of the three groups, no <lb/>significant difference was seen. However, in the <lb/>bipolar and drug dependent groups, the <lb/>frequency of conduct disorder was higher than <lb/>the healthy group. <lb/>In this study, the frequency and percentage of <lb/>children <lb/>with <lb/>conduct <lb/>disorder <lb/>and <lb/>hyperactivity disorder in all three groups was <lb/>investigated based on gender and no significant <lb/>difference was seen. However, the frequency of <lb/>these two disorders was obviously higher in <lb/>boys than girls. There was no significant <lb/>difference between the conduct disorder in <lb/>children with smoking mothers during <lb/>pregnancy in the two bipolar and drug <lb/>dependency groups. There was also no <lb/>significant difference between children with <lb/>ADHD considering smoking during pregnancy <lb/>in the two groups of bipolar and drug <lb/>dependent parents. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Discussion <lb/>In addition to the genetic role, stressful events, <lb/>imbalanced families and other anxiety factors <lb/>have a role in the incidence of ADHD or its <lb/>continuity. 2 The results of this study also shows <lb/>that bipolar disorder in parents as a significant <lb/>correlating factor may disturbs the balance of the <lb/>family, creates anxiety and finally leads to <lb/>behavioral problem in children. However, <lb/>bipolar disorder in the parents increases the <lb/>amount of trauma and other psychiatric <lb/>disorders including mood disorders, psychosis <lb/>and anxiety in children. Previous studies 9 have <lb/>shown that 51% of children with BMD parents <lb/>have psychiatric disorders, the majority having <lb/>ADHD, MDD and behavioral disorders. The <lb/>results of the present study approve these <lb/>results. Moreover, the present study found a <lb/>9.8% frequency of hyperactivity in children of <lb/>drug dependent parents, which is significantly <lb/>different from the controls with a 1% frequency <lb/>(P = 0.006) showing the effect of drug <lb/>dependency as a related factor in the incidence <lb/>of psychiatric disorders in children and is in <lb/>agreement with the results of previous studies, 6 <lb/>in which the prevalence of ADHD in children of <lb/>semi-narcotic and cocaine dependent parents <lb/>were separately studied and reported to be 13% <lb/>and 8%, respectively. <lb/>Although there was no significant difference <lb/>between the conduct disorder in the three <lb/>groups of the study, the higher frequency of this <lb/>disorder in BMD and drug dependent groups <lb/>compared with the controls suggests that family <lb/>problems including parent&apos;s mental illness and <lb/>drug abuse play a significant role in the <lb/>incidence of conduct disorder. 1 In the study of <lb/>Chang et.al also children of BMD parents <lb/>showed higher levels of destructive behavioral <lb/>disorders compared with children of parents <lb/>without any mood disorder. 9 Furthermore, in the <lb/>study of Hirshfield et al, the prevalence of <lb/>behavioral disinhibition in children of BMD <lb/>parents was reported to be significantly high. 10 <lb/>The results also showed that although the <lb/>frequency of ADHD and disorders of the above <lb/>mentioned groups were not significantly <lb/>different between girls and boys, the frequency <lb/>of both disorders was higher in boys than girls, <lb/>and these results are almost in agreement with a <lb/>controlled study in the United States, which <lb/>reported a higher prevalence of ADHD and <lb/>conduct disorder in boys compared with girls. 2 <lb/>In this study, there was no significant <lb/>correlations between smoking during pregnancy <lb/>and the frequency of ADHD and conduct <lb/>disorder in any of the groups. However, other <lb/>studies such as Bolton et al have shown that <lb/>ADHD symptoms and antisocial behaviors have <lb/>both been seen in children whose mothers had <lb/>smoking during their pregnancy and these <lb/>symptoms were more seen in children with <lb/>smoking mothers. 11 Line et al&apos;s study also <lb/>showed that smoking mothers had children with <lb/>a higher risk of ADHD compared with children <lb/>with mothers who consumed alcohol or <lb/>caffeine. 12 The incidence of disorder in children <lb/>was also related with the amount of smoking. In <lb/>the study of Wakschlag et al, mothers who <lb/>smoke more than half a pack of cigarettes during <lb/>pregnancy had sons with conduct disorders <lb/>significantly more than mothers who did not <lb/>smoke. 13 Silberg et al in a study on 538 twin boys <lb/>reported that the relationship between mother&apos;s <lb/>smoking during pregnancy and conduct <lb/>disorder symptoms of their sons was significant <lb/>in cases whose mothers smoked ten or more <lb/>cigarettes a day during pregnancy. 14 <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>ADHD and conduct disorder in children of <lb/>parents with drug abuse disorders was higher <lb/>than the control group, but was not different <lb/>compared with the bipolar group. Therefore, it <lb/>may be mentioned that any kind of mental <lb/>disorder in parents may increase the risk of <lb/>ADHD and conduct disorder in children. <lb/>Further studies on the relationship between <lb/>ADHD and conduct disorder in children and <lb/>other mental disorders of parents may clarify <lb/>this finding. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>For a more precise study and evaluation of <lb/>ADHD and conduct disorder, it would had been <lb/>better to use both Rutter&apos;s Form A (parents) and <lb/>B (teachers) questionnaire, but since a great <lb/>number of samples were selected from <lb/>hospitalized patients in Shahid Beheshti <lb/>Hospital, it was not possible to access the <lb/>teachers to fill the Form B; therefore, just Form A <lb/>was used in this study. <lb/></body>

			<body>To increase the sensitivity of the test, it is <lb/>better to conduct a structured clinical interview <lb/>in addition to questionaire to improve the <lb/>validity of diagnosis. This was not carried out <lb/>due to the time limitation. <lb/>In this study, since the demographic <lb/>questionnaires were mainly completed by <lb/>fathers, and most of them did not have precise <lb/>information about the number of cigarettes <lb/>Smoked by their wives; therefore, the amount of <lb/>smoking during pregnancy may not be accurate. <lb/></body>
