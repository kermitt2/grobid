			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>E. cloacae, a Gram negative bacterium, belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterium <lb/>comprises part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract of 40%-80% of the human population <lb/>and is widely distributed in the environment [1]. The organism has also been isolated from food <lb/>processing plants, fresh vegetables, rice, meat and meat products [2-4]. E. cloacae are capable of <lb/>causing opportunistic infections including pneumonia, urinary tract, wound, skin and soft tissue, <lb/>ophthalmic and bloodstream infections, particularly catheter-related where it has been reported to form <lb/>biofilms in dwelling catheters of hospital patients [5,6]. <lb/>Biofilms are defined as matrix-enclosed bacterial populations, which adhere to each other and to <lb/>surfaces; observations have conclusively shown that biofilm bacteria predominate numerically and <lb/>metabolically, in virtually all ecosystems and are difficult to eliminate [7]. Bacterial biofilms are <lb/>known to be linked to medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, periodontitis, and nosocomial <lb/>infections from the use of catheters and prosthetic heart valves [8]. However, biofilm formation in food <lb/>processing plants has also been documented; both pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms have <lb/>been isolated from such bacterial communities [9]. <lb/>It is well known that bacteria, including foodborne pathogens grow predominantly as biofilms in <lb/>most of their natural habitats, but also in food processing, catering and the domestic environment [10]. <lb/>Biofilms may generate a persistent source of contamination, leading to serious hygienic problems and <lb/>also economic losses due to food spoilage [11]. Poor sanitation of food-contact surfaces is believed to <lb/>be an essential contributing factor of foodborne disease and development of bacterial biofilms. The <lb/>formed biofilms are a source of cross contamination as cells will continuously detach and contaminate <lb/>food once it passes over contaminated surfaces or through aerosols originating from contaminated <lb/>equipment. This may seriously affect the quality and safety of the processed food and pose a potential <lb/>risk to the consumer [12]. <lb/>E. cloacae and other species of Enterobacter have been reported to cause foodborne illnesses <lb/>through consumption of a variety of foods, including infant foods [2]. In our recent study, E. cloacae <lb/>was reported to be the second most prevalent organism from ready-to-eat foods [4]; implying that the <lb/>organism might be one of the emerging foodborne pathogens that can be endemic in food processing <lb/>environments. Studies on the ability of E. cloacae to form biofilms have focused mostly on clinical <lb/>isolates [13,14] where authors have hypothesized that their ability to persist in these environments as <lb/>well as their virulence, is a result of their capacity to colonize medical devices [14]. However, in the <lb/>food industry, studies have demonstrated the ability of Cronobacter sakazakii to adhere to feeding <lb/>bottles, feeding tubes and other food processing surfaces with sparse information on E. cloacae. <lb/>Modern food processing supports and selects for biofilm forming bacteria on food-contact surfaces due <lb/>to mass production, lengthy production cycles and vast surface areas for biofilm development [15]. <lb/>Biofilm formation depends on an interaction between three main components: the bacterial cells, the <lb/></body>

			<body>attachment surface and the surrounding medium [16]. However, environmental factors such as pH, <lb/>temperature, osmolarity, O 2 levels, nutrient composition and the presence of other bacteria also play <lb/>important roles [17,18]. The integration of these influences ultimately determines the pattern and <lb/>behavior of a given bacterium with respect to biofilm development [19]. Hence, biofilms are very <lb/>diverse and unique, not just to the microorganism, but to the particular environment in which they are <lb/>being formed. This makes in vitro characterization of biofilms difficult and requires the establishment <lb/>of laboratory conditions that mimic the natural setting being studied. The ability of these organisms to <lb/>form biofilms at ambient temperature (25 °C), which is mostly room temperature in tropical countries, <lb/>implies that under favorable conditions, they may be able to adhere to kitchen utensils and other <lb/>environments leading to cross-contamination of food processed in these areas. Therefore the present <lb/>study aimed to determine the effects of temperature, nutrient content and incubation time on <lb/>attachment and biofilm formation by E. cloacae strains at ambient (25 °C) and body (37 °C) <lb/>temperature in BHI and TSB media; in an effort to ascertain the suitable biofilm growth conditions for <lb/>this bacterium as a guide to its containment in the food industry. BHI was chosen as one of the <lb/>nutrient-rich laboratory medium, and TSB a less-rich (compared to BHI) culture medium which are <lb/>frequently used in biofilm investigation. <lb/>2. Results and Discussion <lb/>2.1. Microtiter Adherence <lb/>Tests were performed in triplicates on three occasions, the results averaged and standard deviations <lb/>were calculated. The cut-off was defined as three standard deviations above the mean OD of the <lb/>negative control (ODc) which contained broth only. The following criteria were used to classify the <lb/>different adherent strength: OD ≤ OD C = non-adherent, OD C &lt; OD ≤ (2 × OD C ) = weakly adherent; <lb/>(2 × OD C ) &lt; OD ≤ (4 × OD C ) = moderately adherent and (4 × OD C ) &lt; OD = strongly adherent [20]. <lb/>E. cloacae isolates displayed four different biofilm phenotypes (non, weak, moderate and strong <lb/>adherent) after incubation for 24 h in both BHI and TSB (Table 1). The optical density (OD) of non <lb/>adherent (NA), weak adherent (WA), moderate adherent (MA) and strong adherent (SA) obtained <lb/>when the bacteria were grown in BHI ranged from 0.359-0.486, 0.552-1.159, 1.092-2.14 and <lb/>2.192-4.22 respectively. On the other hand, the OD obtained when the bacteria were grown in TSB <lb/>ranged from 0.352-0.618, 0.62-1.583, 1.25-2.414 and 2.542-3.938 for NA, WA, MA and SA <lb/>respectively (Table 2). It was observed that all the strains (100%) adhered to the well of the microtiter <lb/>plate when incubated for 48 h, irrespective of the growth medium (BHI or TSB) and incubation <lb/>temperature (Table 1). On the other hand, adherence ability was demonstrated by 73% (22) and 60% <lb/>(18) of the strains obtained from inoculums prepared in nutrient agar and grown in BHI and TSB <lb/>respectively, compared to 90% (27) and 73% (22) prepared in nutrient broth grown in BHI and TSB <lb/>respectively, when the plates were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h (Table 1). All the strains (100%) from <lb/>nutrient agar cultures grown in BHI were able to form biofilm when incubated at 37 °C for 24 h <lb/>compared to 28 (93%) from nutrient broth grown in BHI; no difference was noted from TSB cultures, <lb/>as 93% of the strains from both nutrient agar and broth formed biofilm (Table 1). However, no <lb/>statistical significance (p-value &gt; 0.05) was observed when the two methods (agar and broth) were <lb/></body>

			<body>compared; thus it can be suggested that E. cloacae strains for biofilm formation assays may be <lb/>cultivated either in broth or on solid medium. <lb/>Worthy of note is the fact that infecting bacteria are often surface-associated, and their cell surface <lb/>can therefore be expected to be more similar to that of bacteria grown on solid medium than to that <lb/>found grown in liquid media [13]. Bacterial cells grown on solid medium differ in expression of <lb/>cell-associated molecules compared to those grown in liquid medium [20,21]. Probably the presence of <lb/>slime layers that are regarded as soft polyelectrolyte layers surrounding the bacteria decreases the <lb/>energy barrier due to electrostatic repulsion in the interaction of the organisms with negatively charged <lb/>substrata and, thus, plays an important role in their adhesion [21]. In their study, Kiers et al. [21] found <lb/>that cell surface softness of Staphylococcus epidermidis first grown on agar medium increased by a <lb/>factor of two, compared to the cell surface softness for the strains grown in liquid medium. Therefore, <lb/>preparation of the inoculum from broth or agar may directly influence the biofilm production, since <lb/>adhesion is the first step in biofilm formation. <lb/>It was also noted that a good number of strains grown in nutrient broth, 90% and 73% cultured in <lb/>BHI and TSB respectively were able to form biofilm, in contrast to 73% and 60% strains prepared <lb/>from agar grown under similar conditions. However, no statistical significance was observed <lb/>(p &gt; 0.005) when the two methods were compared. <lb/>Composition of the medium has been documented to influence the ability of bacteria to produce <lb/>biofilm under in vitro conditions; in particular the presence of glucose in the growth medium <lb/>(i.e., standard TSB medium commonly contains 0.25% glucose) has been reported to enhance biofilm <lb/>formation [22]. Some studies have shown preference for BHI to TSB, although some strains of <lb/>Staphylococcus, Vibrio and Pseudomonas species have been reported to produce greater biofilm <lb/>quantities in TSB while others do so in BHI [22,23]. The present study compared the two growth <lb/>media and observed no statistical significance (p &gt; 0.005). However, a slightly higher number of <lb/>E. cloacae strains grown on BHI demonstrated the ability to adhere to the wells of the microtitre plate, <lb/>implying that although both BHI and TSB media could support the development of E. cloacae biofilms <lb/>in vitro, some strains will produce strong biofilms on BHI than TSB. These findings are in agreement <lb/>with other studies [17,24], which found that supplementation (enriching) of TSB medium with glucose <lb/>increased the ability of Staphylococci to form biofilms, while Knobloch et al. [25] recommended the <lb/>use of the two media to confirm a biofilm positive isolate. <lb/>All (100%) of the E. cloacae strains demonstrated adherence characteristics at the low temperature <lb/>of 25 °C when incubated for 48 h in comparison to the range of 60%-90% of the strains that had <lb/>the same characteristics when incubated for 24 h only; the range increased with high temperatures <lb/>(37 °C) where 93%-100% of the strains demonstrated the adherence ability when incubated for 24 h <lb/>(Table 1). Statistical significant adherence was observed (p &lt; 0.005) when the two incubation periods <lb/>were compared, which may imply that long incubation times and high temperatures influence <lb/>biofilm formation. <lb/>Previous works have indicated that temperature, nutrients and other components in media affect <lb/>attachment of microorganisms to surfaces of various materials [26,27]. The present study observed <lb/>strong biofilms from plates incubated at 37 °C (Table 1). This could be attributed to the fast growth <lb/>rate of the bacteria at higher temperatures [23]. Similarly, Iversen et al. [27] reported strong adherence <lb/>of their test bacteria at high temperatures (&gt;40 °C). <lb/></body>

			<body>Contrary to these findings were the observations by Di Bonaventura et al. [18] who reported a <lb/>higher biofilm production at a lower temperature (32 °C) than the higher temperatures of 37 °C; which <lb/>may further suggest that biofilm formation varies with temperature and organism. Hence from the <lb/>findings of the current study it can be deduced that E. cloacae strains will produce strong biofilms at <lb/>higher temperatures. <lb/>2.2. The Capability of E. cloacae Strains to Autoaggregate and Coaggregate with Partner Organisms <lb/>All E. cloacae strains were able to coaggregate with the seven partner strains; the coaggregation <lb/>index ranged from 12%-74% with best coaggregate activity observed when partnered with <lb/>Streptococcus pyogenes (54%-74%) (Table 3). It was also noted that most of the strains which weakly <lb/>adhered to the wells had a slightly higher coaggregation index range of 56%-74% followed by <lb/>moderate adherent 12%-70% and the least was non-adherent with 54%-66% (Table 3). Of particular <lb/>interest was a weakly adherent isolate, EC 235 which demonstrated the strongest coaggregation with <lb/>all the partners. On the other hand, all the strains were able to adhere to each other, with <lb/>autoaggregation range of 27%-89% (Table 3). <lb/>First recognized between bacterial isolates from human dental plague, coaggregation is the highly <lb/>specific recognition and adhesion of different bacterial species to one another by specific molecules. <lb/>Coaggregation in biofilms is important in development of mix-culture biofilms; it enables cells to <lb/>withstand the highly changing environment, which on the other hand can adversely affect <lb/>mono-dispersed cells. The results of this study revealed that E. cloacae isolates which weakly adhered <lb/>to the microtiter plate demonstrated the strongest coaggregation with all the seven partner strain; these <lb/>findings suggest the possibility of these strains to act as bridging organisms in multi-generic biofilms <lb/>due to their ability to coaggregate with diverse coaggregating partners. Such bridging organisms are <lb/>believed to carry complementary receptors recognized by functionally similar adhesins on cells from <lb/>distinct genera [28]. Figure 1 shows the scanning electron micrographs of E. cloacae autoaggregates <lb/>and its coaggregate partner Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442. The SEM graphics of coaggregate <lb/>assay demonstrated strong coaggregation with P. aeruginosa. It was also observed that E. cloacae <lb/>strains coaggregated with organisms important in food spoilage and/or intoxications, i.e., S. aureus, <lb/>S. Typhimurium, Shigella sonnei and P. aeruginosa implying that E. cloacae in food processing plants <lb/>can enhance the bridging of organisms in multi-generic biofilms. <lb/>3. Experimental <lb/>3.1. Bacterial Strains <lb/>Bacterial strains used in the study consist of E. cloacae previously isolated from various food <lb/>sources [4] and reference strains: S. pyogenes A ATCC 49399, Plesiomonas shigelloides ATCC <lb/>51903, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, S. Typhimurium ATCC 13311, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC <lb/>35654 and S. sonnei ATCC 29930. These strains have been reported to form biofilms [29-32]; and <lb/>were also available in our laboratory at the time of the experiments. <lb/></body>

Scanning electron micrographs of an autoaggregate and coaggregate biofilm of <lb/>E. cloacae and its coaggregate partner P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 (a) strong adherent <lb/>autoaggregate; (b) coaggregate of E. cloacae and partner P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442. <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>3.2. Microtiter Plate Assay <lb/>E. cloacae isolates were screened for their adherence to polystyrene microtiter plate wells following <lb/>24 and 48 h incubation at 25 °C or 37 °C, in BHI and TSB. The method previously described by <lb/>Nyenje et al. [33] was employed which made use of the agar and broth techniques; for the agar <lb/>method, E. cloacae isolates were cultured on Nutrient agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) and plates <lb/>incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Few single colonies were suspended in sterile saline to a turbidity standard <lb/>comparable to a 0.5 McFarland. The suspension was vortexed for 1 min from which 20 µL was <lb/>pipetted into a 96-well U-bottomed microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-one GmbH, Frickenhausen, <lb/>Germany) containing 180 µL of BHI or TSB (Oxoid). With the inoculum for broth technique, isolates <lb/>were grown in Nutrient broth (Oxoid), incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the bacterial <lb/>suspension was diluted 1:100 in BHI or TSB; an aliquot of 200 μL of diluted bacterial suspension was <lb/>added to each well. The negative control wells contained 200 mL of broth only per well. The plates <lb/>were incubated aerobically at different temperatures (25 °C and 37 °C) for 24 and 48 h. At the end of <lb/>incubation period, the wells were carefully aspirated and washed three times with 200 µL of sterile <lb/>normal saline to remove the unbound bacteria. The plates were left to dry overnight, fixed with hot air <lb/>at 65 °C for 1 h, and the wells were stained with 150 µL of 1% crystal violet for 30 min. The plates <lb/>were carefully rinsed off under running tap water to remove excess stain, left to dry at room <lb/>temperature before resolubilizing the dye bound cells with 150 µL of 33% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. <lb/>The optical density (OD) of each well was measured at 595 nm using a microtiter plate reader <lb/>(SynergyMx, Biotek TM Winooski, VT, USA). Reference strains of P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and <lb/>S. aureus NCTC 6571 were used as positive controls because they have been widely reported to form <lb/>biofilms in various environments [29-32]. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.3. Autoaggregation and Coaggregation Assays <lb/>A representative of the different biofilm phenotypes were examined for their ability to coaggregate <lb/>with the following reference strains: S. aureus NCTC 6571, S. pyogenes A ATCC 49399, S. <lb/>Typhimurium ATCC 13311, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. shigelloides ATCC 51903, A. hydrophila <lb/>ATCC 35654, S. sonnei ATCC 29930. The individual strain was grown in 20 mL of BHI broth at <lb/>37 °C, harvested after 48 h and washed twice in 3mM NaCl containing 0.5 mM CaCl 2 . Subsequently, <lb/>the cells were re-suspended in the same solution (3 mM NaCl containing 0.5 mM CaCl 2 ), centrifuged <lb/>at 650 × g for 2 min and the supernatant discarded; the OD of the cell suspension used for coaggregation <lb/>assay was adjusted to 0.3 at a wavelength of 660 nm, using an automated spectrophotometer (Optima <lb/>Scientific V-1200, Cambridge, UK). Equal volumes of the cell suspension (1 mL each) of E. cloacae <lb/>and the coaggregating partners were mixed and the OD (OD Tot ) immediately read at 660 nm before <lb/>incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, the tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for <lb/>2 min and the OD of the supernatant (OD s ) measured at the same wavelength (660 nm) [20]. The <lb/>degree of coaggregation of the paired isolates was determined using the equation: <lb/>% coaggregation = (OD Tot − OD s ) × 100/OD Tot <lb/>For autoaggregation assay, the individual bacterial suspension adjusted to an OD of 0.3 was <lb/>incubated at room temperature for 1 h, centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 min and the OD of the <lb/>supernatant was measured at 660 nm. The degree of autoaggregation was calculated as follows: <lb/>% autoaggregation = (OD − OD 60 ) × 100/OD 0 <lb/>OD 0 refers to the initial OD of the organism, and OD 60 is the OD of the supernatant after 60 min <lb/>of incubation. <lb/>3.4. Characterization of Biofilm Formation Using Scanning Electron Microscope <lb/>To evaluate the architecture of the formed biofilms, SEM was used in accordance with the method <lb/>previously described by Nyenje et al. [33]. Briefly, the isolates were grown on a microscope cover slip <lb/>(22 × 22 mm) in a Petri-dish half-filled with BHI broth and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. For the <lb/>coaggregation assay, the partner isolate was added after 1 h of incubation. At the end of the incubation, <lb/>the cover slips were washed three times with normal saline before fixing with 2.5% (w/v) <lb/>glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated in a series of 20, 40, 60, <lb/>80 and 99.5% ethanol solution for 30 min in each concentration before post fixing in 1% osmium <lb/>tetroxide (OsO 4 ). The samples were critical point-dried using CO 2 and sputter-coated with gold <lb/>palladium using an Elko 1B.3 ion coater before viewing with the SEM (Japan Electron Optical <lb/>Laboratories JSM-6390LV, Tokyo, Japan). <lb/>4. Statistical Analysis <lb/>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19. One way ANOVA followed by Turkey&apos;s <lb/>post hoc test was used to compare the agar and broth methods, BHI and TSB liquid media. The <lb/>incubation temperatures and periods were also compared; the mean difference was considered <lb/>significant at p &lt; 0.05. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. Conclusions <lb/>This study demonstrated that E. cloacae readily form biofilms on plastic surfaces, which are <lb/>nowadays frequently used in food-processing environments, raising a great concern for the food <lb/>industry as organisms in biofilms are difficult to eliminate, hence creating a reservoir for cross <lb/>contamination. The study also indicated the suitability of BHI and TSB medium for the cultivation of <lb/>E. cloacae biofilm however, temperature and incubation time significantly affected biofilm formation <lb/>by these bacteria. <lb/></body>
