			<front>AUTOPHAGY <lb/>COPII vesicles and the <lb/>expansion of the phagophore <lb/>A new study has identified the proteins that adapt COPII vesicles to the <lb/>needs of starving cells. <lb/>CATHERINE RABOUILLE <lb/></front>

			<body>W <lb/>hen a cell is starving, it can recycle <lb/>cytoplasmic elements that are dis-<lb/>pensable or faulty to obtain the <lb/>amino acids and nutrients it needs to survive. <lb/>This process, known as autophagy, is orches-<lb/>trated by more than 40 different proteins <lb/>(Mizushima et al., 2011). It starts with the for-<lb/>mation of the phagophore, a flat membrane-<lb/>bound structure that expands and engulfs the <lb/>components destined for digestion. Although <lb/>the membrane of many organelles -including <lb/>the Golgi apparatus -can be the source of the <lb/>phagophore, the structure appears to largely <lb/>emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It <lb/>has recently also become clear that the early <lb/>expansion of the phagophore requires vesicles <lb/>coated with a protein complex called <lb/>COPII, hereafter referred to as COPII <lb/>vesicles (reviewed in van Leeuwen et al., 2018). <lb/>Cells with plenty of nutrients grow by produc-<lb/>ing proteins, and COPII vesicles are essential in <lb/>this process. They bud from ER exit sites and <lb/>transport newly synthesized proteins to the <lb/>Golgi and many other membrane compart-<lb/>ments. An array of molecules works together on <lb/> the membrane at the ER exit sites to form these <lb/>vesicles. Indeed, the transmembrane ER protein <lb/>Sec12 and the small GTPase Sar1 help to recruit <lb/>the Sec23/Sec24 complex that will create the <lb/>inner coat of the vesicle, while another complex, <lb/>Sec13/31, will then form the outer coat (Gomez-<lb/>Navarro and Miller, 2016). However, while <lb/>starving cells require COPII vesicles for <lb/>autophagy, cells deprived of nutrients reduce <lb/>their protein secretion (Jeong et al., <lb/>2018; Zacharogianni et al., 2014): in this con-<lb/>text, how can these vesicles be specifically gen-<lb/>erated to help expand the phagophore? <lb/>Several complementary models have been <lb/>put forward to explain how this could be possi-<lb/>ble. Some propose that once the COPII vesicles <lb/>have formed at the ER exit sites, they are redir-<lb/>ected away from the Golgi and towards the <lb/>nascent phagophore (Rao et al., 2016; <lb/>Tan et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2016; <lb/>Wang et al., 2015). Another model suggests <lb/>that in starving mammalian cells, instead of <lb/>being redirected, COPII vesicles bud from a dif-<lb/>ferent place altogether. Indeed, during starva-<lb/>tion, COPII vesicles emerge from a membrane <lb/>between the ER and the Golgi, the ER-Golgi <lb/>intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Autophagy <lb/>activates an enzyme, the kinase ULK1, which <lb/>drives this change by helping to relocate the <lb/>COPII protein Sec12 to the ERGIC (Ge et al., <lb/>2017). Once the vesicles have budded from this <lb/>structure, they go on to expand the phagophore <lb/>(Ge et al., 2015). Now, in eLife, Michele Pagano <lb/>and colleagues at New York University School of <lb/>Medicine, IBioBA in Buenos Aires and other <lb/>institutes in the United States and Argentina -<lb/>including Yeon-Tae Jeong as first author -report <lb/></body>

			<body>results that support and expand this last model <lb/>(Jeong et al., 2018). <lb/>Combining state-of-the-art biochemistry with <lb/>imaging, Jeong et al. show that COPII vesicles <lb/>do indeed bud from the ERGIC during autoph-<lb/>agy. But the experiments also reveal that the <lb/>inner coat of these vesicles is different. When <lb/>cells are growing, an enzyme known as FBXW5 <lb/>tags Sec23B for destruction, and the protein is <lb/>then degraded slowly, but constantly. Under <lb/>these conditions, the remaining Sec23B proteins <lb/>may bind Sec24 and help form COPII vesicles <lb/>destined for secretion, but this is likely a small <lb/>contribution. <lb/>The study by Jeong et al. further reveals that <lb/>when starvation activates ULK1, the enzyme <lb/>then phosphorylates Sec23B to produce Sec23B-<lb/>P, which is impervious to FBXW5; Sec23B-P <lb/>starts to accumulate and bind to Sec24A and <lb/>Sec24B -but not Sec24C or Sec24D. The <lb/>Sec23B-P/Sec24AB complex then relocates to <lb/>the ERGIC (possibly as a direct consequence of <lb/>the phosphorylation of Sec23B), and it forms <lb/>COPII vesicles specifically destined to fuel the <lb/>growth of the phagophore. The beauty of these <lb/>experiments is thus to show that certain COPII <lb/>subunits have a clear, dedicated role during <lb/>autophagy, with Sec23B-P/Sec24AB playing a <lb/>key part in forming the vesicles required in this <lb/>process (Figure 1). It remains to be examined <lb/>whether Sec23B-P/Sec24AB also helps transport <lb/>proteins to the Golgi under starvation condi-<lb/>tions, when general secretion is reduced and the <lb/>complex is efficiently brought to the ERGIC. <lb/>While it is likely that the complex is specific to <lb/>autophagy, this would need to be further <lb/>investigated. <lb/>The work by Jeong et al. also helps to better <lb/>grasp how ULK1 controls the use of COPII pro-<lb/>teins during autophagy: the kinase helps to relo-<lb/>cate the machinery from ER exit sites to the <lb/>ERGIC, while also tweaking the nature of the <lb/>vesicles&apos; inner coat to fuel the early expansion of <lb/>the phagophore. These results add to work at <lb/>Berkeley, which showed how ULK1 participates <lb/>in bringing Sec12 to the ERGIC, initiating the <lb/>formation of COPII vesicles (Ge et al., 2015; <lb/>Ge et al., 2017). In yeast, ULK1 also contributes <lb/>to the recruitment of a protein that, once acti-<lb/>vated, will direct COPII vesicles to the phago-<lb/>phore assembly site (Wang et al., 2013). Next, <lb/>it will be interesting to learn how the enzyme <lb/>acts on other components of the ER exit sites -<lb/>including Sec16, a ULK1 substrate during peri-<lb/>ods of growth (Joo et al., 2016). <lb/>Figure 1. Autophagy starts with the production of special COPII vesicles. When cells are <lb/>growing (top), the E3 ligase FBXW5, which is associated with Cul1 and SKP1, tags Sec23B <lb/>(pink circle) with ubiquitin (Ub). This labels Sec23B for destruction by the cell. Starvation kick-<lb/>starts autophagy, whereby the cell recycles certain components in order to obtain amino <lb/>acids and nutrients. It also activates ULK1, a kinase that phosphorylates Sec23B (red circle) <lb/>on Serine 186, thus preventing FBXW5 from tagging it for destruction. Instead, Sec23B-P <lb/>associates with Sec24AB (green) to form a complex that is not recruited to the endoplasmic <lb/>reticulum exit sites (ERES; gray line), but to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC; <lb/>black line). Another COPII protein, Sec12 (light blue), has also been relocated to this <lb/>structure. This creates special COPII vesicles (dark blue) that bud to fuel the growth of the <lb/>phagophore (violet structure) and autophagic activity. <lb/></body>
