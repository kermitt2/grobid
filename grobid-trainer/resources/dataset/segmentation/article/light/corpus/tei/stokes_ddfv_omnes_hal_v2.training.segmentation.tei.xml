			<front>A discrete duality finite volume discretization of the <lb/>vorticity-velocity-pressure Stokes problem on almost arbitrary <lb/>two-dimensional grids <lb/>Sarah Delcourte 1 and Pascal Omnes 23 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>We present an application of the discrete duality finite volume method to the numerical <lb/>approximation of the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation of the 2D Stokes equations, <lb/>associated to various non-standard boundary conditions. The finite volume method is <lb/>based on the use of discrete differential operators obeying some discrete duality principles. <lb/>The scheme may be seen as an extension of the classical MAC scheme to almost arbitrary <lb/>meshes, thanks to an appropriate choice of degrees of freedom. The efficiency of the scheme <lb/>is illustrated by numerical examples over unstructured triangular and locally refined non-<lb/>conforming meshes, which confirm the theoretical convergence analysis led in the article. <lb/>Keywords: Stokes equations; vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation; boundary conditions; <lb/>discrete duality; finite volumes; arbitrary meshes; a priori estimates <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Let Ω be a bounded, open, connected but not necessarily simply connected polygon of R 2 , whose <lb/>boundary is denoted by Γ; we consider the numerical approximation by means of finite volumes <lb/>of the solution of the Stokes equations: with given functions f , g, σ, p d and ω d and a given real <lb/>number m ω , find (u, p) satisfying <lb/>−∆u + ∇p = f in Ω, <lb/>(1.1) <lb/>∇ • u = g in Ω, <lb/>(1.2) <lb/>supplemented with one of the following non-standard sets of conditions <lb/>u • n = σ over Γ , ∇ × u = ω d over Γ and <lb/>Ω <lb/>p(x)dx = 0 , <lb/>(1.3) <lb/>u • n = σ over Γ , p = p d over Γ and <lb/>Ω <lb/>∇ × u(x)dx = m ω , <lb/>(1.4) <lb/>u • τ = σ over Γ , ∇ × u = ω d over Γ and <lb/>Ω <lb/>p(x)dx = 0 , <lb/>(1.5) <lb/>u • τ = σ over Γ , p = p d over Γ and <lb/>Ω <lb/>∇ × u(x)dx = m ω . <lb/>(1.6) <lb/></body>

			<body>These conditions are written here in the case of simply connected domains, but they will be <lb/>extended in the core of the article to non-simply connected domains. There are compatibility <lb/>conditions between the data (g, σ) in (1.3) and (1.4), the data (ω d , σ) in (1.5) and the data <lb/>(m ω , σ) in (1.6). They will be discussed in subsection 4.1. <lb/>As recognized for example by Dubois et. al. [1], these non-standard conditions can be treated <lb/>in a very general and natural way thanks to the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation of the <lb/>Stokes problem (for earlier works based on different approaches, we refer to [2] and [3]). Since <lb/>−∆u = ∇ × ∇ × u − ∇∇ • u, using (1.2), and introducing the vorticity ω, Eq. (1.1) may be <lb/>split as <lb/>∇ × ω + ∇p = f + ∇g in Ω , <lb/>(1.7) <lb/>∇ × u = ω in Ω . <lb/>(1.8) <lb/>The mathematical analysis of system (1.7)-(1.8)-(1.2) with various boundary conditions was led <lb/>in several references, among which [4, 5, 6, 7, 1]. Finite element methods for the vorticity-<lb/>velocity-pressure formulation were analyzed in [4, 5, 8, 9]. Spectral methods were considered in <lb/>[6, 10] and [11], where a least-square formulation is used. <lb/>In the present work, we shall be interested in a finite volume generalization of the Marker <lb/>and Cell (MAC) scheme on very general meshes. The MAC scheme was developed initially <lb/>in [12] on staggered rectangular grids and extended to the so-called covolume scheme using <lb/>Delaunay-Voronoi mesh pairs, as reviewed in [13]. We note that the orthogonality property of <lb/>these mesh pairs might be in certain cases a drawback, in particular in the context of adaptive <lb/>mesh refinement. The standard MAC scheme discretizes (1.1)-(1.2), while the covolume scheme <lb/>discretizes (1.7)-(1.8)-(1.2). Given a (primal) mesh, the MAC and covolume schemes use as <lb/>velocity unknowns the normal components of the velocity field with respect to the edges of the <lb/>control volumes, while the pressure unknowns are located at their circumcenters. In addition, <lb/>the covolume scheme considers vorticity unknowns at the vertices of the primal mesh. <lb/>The generalization of the MAC scheme we propose is a new application of the &quot;discrete dual-<lb/>ity finite volume&quot; (DDFV) method [14]. Originally developed for linear diffusion equations [15, <lb/>16, 17], the DDFV method was extended to nonlinear diffusion [18, 19, 20], convection-diffusion <lb/>[21], electro-cardiology [22, 23], drift-diffusion and energy-transport models [24], electro-and <lb/>magnetostatics [25], electromagnetism [26], and Stokes flows [27, 28, 29, 30]. The advantage of <lb/>this covolume-like method is that it allows the use of almost arbitrary meshes, including very <lb/>distorted, degenerating, or highly non-conforming meshes (see the numerical tests in [15]). The <lb/>name of the method comes from the definition of discrete gradient and divergence operators <lb/>verifying a discrete Green formula. <lb/>In order to get rid of the orthogonality constraints that restrict the use of MAC and covolume <lb/>schemes to certain families of meshes, the price to pay in the DDFV framework is to discretize <lb/>both velocity components on the edges of the control volumes, while pressure and vorticity <lb/>unknowns are associated with the centroids of the primal cells and to their vertices. Then, we <lb/>integrate both components of (1.7) on cells associated with the edges (the so-called &quot;diamond <lb/>mesh&quot;) and (1.8) and (1.2) on both primal and dual cells associated to the vertices. This process <lb/>uses discrete versions of the divergence, gradient and curl operators which appear in (1.7), (1.8) <lb/>and (1.2). These discrete operators are known to satisfy properties analogous to those verified <lb/>by the continuous operators [25]. With these properties, we show that the solution of the DDFV <lb/></body>

			<body>discretization of the Stokes equations with any of the conditions (1.3) to (1.6) can be reduced <lb/>to the solution of four discrete Laplace equations involving the pressure, the vorticity and the <lb/>potentials stemming from the discrete Hodge decomposition of the velocity. <lb/>Other approaches with finite volumes were developed in [31, 32, 33, 34]. In [31, 32], velocity <lb/>unknowns are located at the cell centers, and pressure unknowns at the vertices. But an orthog-<lb/>onality condition is also needed: the segments connecting the cell centers must be orthogonal to <lb/>the edges of the mesh, which restricts this scheme to particular families of meshes. The same <lb/>kind of orthogonality condition is needed in [33, 34], where velocity and pressure unknowns <lb/>are all located at the cell centers. This choice requires some stabilization obtained by penaliz-<lb/>ing the discrete incompressibility equation. Such a penalization is also needed in the previous <lb/>approaches that used the DDFV ideas [28, 29, 30] because in these works, velocity unknowns <lb/>are located at the cell centers and vertices, while pressure is defined on the edges (or faces in <lb/>3D) of the cells, and thus the pressure gradient is proved to be injective only on simplices, and <lb/>there might be spurious pressure modes on more general meshes if no penalization is added. In <lb/>the approach developed in the present article, such a penalization is not needed: The pressure <lb/>gradient is computed from two pressure differences, one related to pressure unknowns located <lb/>at the vertices of an edge, and another related to pressure unknowns located at two neighboring <lb/>cell centers. This leads to the fact that on any mesh, a vanishing gradient implies that pressure <lb/>is a constant on the primal and on the dual meshes. Moreover, in our work, the important role <lb/>played in the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of vector fields by internal boundaries in the case <lb/>of non-simply connected domains is very simply taken into account through the Euler formula <lb/>that links the number of edges, cells, vertices and internal boundaries (see [25] for more details <lb/>on this). This wouldn&apos;t have been the case if we had chosen the same unknown locations as in <lb/>[28, 29, 30]. <lb/>Another important result we obtain here is that there exists a way to discretize the data <lb/>f such that if g = 0 and if f is the gradient of the pressure (resp. the curl of the vorticity), <lb/>then our scheme computes exactly (up to the precision of 1D quadrature formulas) the pressure <lb/>and a vanishing vorticity (resp. the vorticity and a vanishing pressure) at the cell centers and <lb/>vertices. <lb/>As compared to previous work with DDFV schemes, the novelty here is to realize that <lb/>the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation of the Stokes equations associated to an appropriate <lb/>choice of the degrees of freedom reduces the numerical solution of this problem to four discrete <lb/>DDFV Laplace equations. Another novelty is that in the course of the numerical analysis of the <lb/>scheme, we are led to evaluate the difference between some functions and their pointwise values <lb/>on the one hand, and their mean-value projections on the other hand, both on the primal and <lb/>dual meshes. These kinds of estimations had never been used previously in the DDFV context. <lb/>Moreover, we had to combine this with some Poincaré inequalities which have recently been <lb/>proved [35]. <lb/>When g = 0 in Eq. (1.2), another feature of this scheme is that it satisfies the notion of <lb/>&quot;reinforced incompressibility&quot; introduced in a finite volume element context in [36] and in a finite <lb/>element context in [37] to overcome non-perfectly divergence free velocity modes that may appear <lb/>in unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations performed with Crouzeix-Raviart [38] finite elements of <lb/>lowest order. Indeed, since these elements involve pressure unknowns located at the triangle <lb/>barycenters only, the incompressibility constraint is satisfied only around these barycenters, but <lb/>the discrete velocity divergence, when computed around the vertices of the mesh, may not vanish <lb/></body>

			<body>or even be small. A cure to this problem, proposed in [37] and [36], is to add pressure unknowns <lb/>at the vertices of the mesh, which introduces incompressibility constraints around these nodes. <lb/>Thus, on triangular meshes, the scheme presented here has exactly the same unknowns as (but <lb/>is however not equivalent to) those involved in [37] and [36], and incompressibility conditions <lb/>are written on each triangle (primal cell) and around each vertex (dual cell) of the mesh. The <lb/>advantage of the scheme we present here is that it handles meshes that are much more general <lb/>than triangular. <lb/>The convergence analysis shows that pressure, vorticity, their gradients and the velocity field <lb/>are all first order accurate on general meshes. Moreover, for families of meshes where diamond <lb/>cells are almost all parallelograms, pressure and vorticity gradients superconverge with the order <lb/>1.5. The numerical tests included in this work validate these theoretical results, and even go <lb/>beyond: We observe that pressure and vorticity converge on general meshes with the order 2, <lb/>while velocity converges with the order 2 for families of triangular meshes or for which the <lb/>diamond cells are almost all parallelograms. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce the notations associated with <lb/>the primal, dual and diamond meshes. In Section 3, we define the discrete gradient and vector <lb/>curl on the diamond cells, and the corresponding adjoint discrete divergence and scalar curl <lb/>on the primal and dual cells and state their properties. In Section 4, we present the DDFV <lb/>schemes for the steady Stokes problems with the various conditions (1.3)-(1.6) extended to <lb/>non-simply connected domains. Section 5 is devoted to the convergence analysis of the DDFV <lb/>scheme with conditions (1.3). Finally, section 6 presents numerical results over unstructured <lb/>and non-conforming meshes. <lb/>2 Definitions and notations <lb/>Let Ω be a bounded connected polygon of R 2 , with boundary denoted by Γ. We suppose that <lb/>the domain has Q holes. Throughout the paper, we shall assume that Q &gt; 0, but the results also <lb/>hold for the case Q = 0. Let Γ 0 denote the exterior boundary of Ω and let Γ q , with q ∈ [1, Q], <lb/>be the interior polygonal boundaries of Ω, so that Γ = Γ 0 <lb/>q∈[1,Q] <lb/>Γ q . <lb/>2.1 Construction of the primal mesh <lb/>We consider a first partition of Ω (named primal mesh) composed of elements T i , with i ∈ [1, I], <lb/>supposed to be convex polygons. With each element T i of the mesh, we associate a node G i <lb/>located at the barycentre of T i . The area of T i is denoted by |T i |. We shall denote by J the <lb/>total number of edges of this mesh and by J Γ the number of these edges which are located on <lb/>the boundary Γ and we associate with each of these boundary edges its midpoint, also denoted <lb/>by G i with i ∈ [I + 1, I + J Γ ]. By a slight abuse of notations, we shall write i ∈ Γ q if and only <lb/>if G i ∈ Γ q . <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2 Construction of the dual mesh <lb/>We denote by S k , with k ∈ [1, K], the nodes of the polygons of the primal mesh. Around each <lb/>S k , we construct a polygon P k by joining the points G i associated to the elements of the primal <lb/>mesh (and possibly to the boundary edges) of which S k is a node, through the midpoints of the <lb/>edges. The area of P k is denoted by |P k |. The family of cells (P k ) k∈[1,K] constitutes a second <lb/>partition of Ω, which we name dual mesh. We shall also write k ∈ Γ q (respectively k ∈ Γ) if and <lb/>only if S k ∈ Γ q (resp. S k ∈ Γ). Figure 1 displays an example of a non-conforming primal mesh <lb/>and its associated dual mesh. <lb/>Pk <lb/>Ti <lb/>Sk <lb/>Gi <lb/>Figure 1: An example of a primal mesh and its associated dual mesh. <lb/>2.3 Construction of the diamond mesh <lb/>With each edge of the primal mesh, denoted by A j (whose length is |A j |), with j ∈ [1, J], <lb/>we associate a quadrilateral named &quot;diamond cell&quot;, denoted by D j . When A j is not on the <lb/>boundary, this cell is obtained by joining the points S k1(j) and S k2(j) , which are the two nodes <lb/>of A j , with the points G i1(j) and G i2(j) associated with the elements of the primal mesh which <lb/>share this edge. When A j is on the boundary Γ, the cell D j is obtained by joining the two <lb/>nodes of A j with the point G i1(j) associated with the only element of the primal mesh of which <lb/>A j is an edge and to the point G i2(j) associated with A j (i.e. by convention i 2 (j) is element of <lb/>[I + 1, I + J Γ ] when A j is located on Γ). The cells D j constitute the &quot;diamond-mesh&quot;, which is <lb/>a third partition of Ω. The area of the cell D j is denoted by |D j |. Such cells are displayed on <lb/>Fig. 2. We shall also write j ∈ Γ q (respectively j ∈ Γ) if and only if A j ⊂ Γ q (resp. j ⊂ Γ). <lb/>2.4 Definitions of geometrical elements <lb/>The following geometrical elements are displayed on Fig. 3. The unit vector normal to A j <lb/>is denoted by n j and is oriented so that its dot product with G i1(j) G i2(j) is positive. We <lb/>further denote by A j the segment [G i1(j) G i2(j) ] (whose length is |A j |) and by n j the unit <lb/>vector normal to A j oriented so that S k1(j) S k2(j) • n j ≥ 0. We also define the unit vectors <lb/>τ j and τ j such that (n j , τ j ) and (n j , τ j ) are orthogonal positively oriented bases of R 2 . We <lb/>denote by M j the midpoint of A j and by A j1 (respectively A j2 ) the segment [G i1(j) M j ] (resp. <lb/>[M j G i2(j) ]) and by n j1 (resp. n j2 ) the unit normal vector to A j1 (resp. A j2 ) oriented so that <lb/>|A j |n j = |A j1 |n j1 + |A j2 |n j2 . We define for each i ∈ [1, I] the set V (i) of integers j ∈ [1, J] such <lb/></body>

First, when associated with one of the sets of conditions <lb/>(4.1) or (4.2), the data has to verify <lb/>Ω <lb/>g(x)dx = <lb/>Γ <lb/>σ(ξ)dξ. <lb/>(4.5) <lb/>Then, when associated with the set (4.4), integration of (1.8) over Ω and application of the <lb/>Green formula and of the boundary conditions yield <lb/>Γ <lb/>σ(ξ)dξ = m ω . <lb/>(4.6) <lb/>Finally, in the case of Eqs. (1.2), (1.7) and (1.8) associated with the set (4.3), the situation is <lb/>more involved. Indeed, we infer from (1.8) that Γ σ(ξ)dξ = Ω ω(x)dx. However, the quantity <lb/>Ω ω(x)dx is not a data given by (4.3), but is a result of the computation of ω through the <lb/>Hodge decomposition of f + ∇g expressed by Eq. (1.7) associated with the conditions over p <lb/>and ω expressed in the set (4.3). This may be interpreted as an implicit compatibility condition <lb/>between the boundary conditions ω d and σ in (4.3). Further details on how to handle this will <lb/>be given in subsection 4.2. <lb/>4.2 Discretization of the Stokes equations in vorticity-velocity-pressure <lb/>formulation <lb/>In this subsection, we are interested in the approximation of the continuous problem given <lb/>by (1.2)-(1.7)-(1.8) associated with one of the sets of conditions (4.1) to (4.4).

Applying the discrete vector curl operator to (4.7) on any primal cell and on any inner <lb/>dual cell yields the first two lines of (4.11), thanks to (3.12) and (3.13). <lb/>Next, for a given q ∈ [1, Q], we consider the element ψ ∈ R I+J Γ × R K which has the <lb/>following values: ψ T <lb/>i = 1, ∀i ∈ Γ q and ψ T <lb/>i = 0 everywhere else, and ψ P <lb/>k = 0 everywhere. Then, <lb/>we compute the scalar product (3.5) of Eq. (4.7) with ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ: <lb/>(∇ D <lb/>h × ω, ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ) D + (∇ D <lb/>h p, ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ) D = (s, ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ) D . <lb/>(4.13) <lb/>Using the orthogonality of ∇ D <lb/>h p and ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ (see last line of Prop. 3.8), using the discrete <lb/>Green formula (3.10) and Eq. (3.13), we infer <lb/>−(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>• ∇ D <lb/>h ω, ψ) T,P − (∇ D <lb/>h × ω • τ , ψ) Γ,h = (∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× s, ψ) T,P − (s • τ , ψ) Γ,h . <lb/>(4.14) <lb/>Further, using the fact that ψ vanishes everywhere but on the boundary points G i , the first <lb/>term in the left-hand side and the first term in the right-hand side of (4.14) vanish. Next, since <lb/>∇ D <lb/>h × ω • τ = −∇ D <lb/>h ω • n, and using the definition (3.7) and the fact that the values of ψ on <lb/>the boundaries imply that ψj = 1/2 for all j ∈ Γ q and ψj = 0 for all j ∈ Γ q for any q = q, <lb/>Equ. (4.14) implies −(∇ D <lb/>h ω • n, 1 <lb/>2 ) Γq,h = (s • τ , 1 <lb/>2 ) Γq,h and thus the third line of (4.11). <lb/>Last, we consider the element ψ ∈ R I+J Γ × R K which has the following values: ψ T <lb/>i = 1, <lb/>∀i ∈ Γ q and ψ P <lb/>k = 1, ∀k ∈ Γ q and vanishing everywhere else. Then, the dot product of Eq. <lb/>(4.7) with ∇ D <lb/>h × ψ yields (4.13) and (4.14) again. Now, we use the fact that the first term <lb/>in the left-hand side of (4.14) equals − 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>k∈Γq |P k | (∇ P <lb/>h • ∇ D <lb/>h ω) k while the first term in the <lb/>right-hand side of (4.14) equals 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>k∈Γq |P k | (∇ P <lb/>h × s) k . Using the previously proved third line <lb/>of (4.11), we obtain the fourth line of (4.11). <lb/>Once ω has been computed, the derivation of (4.12) from (4.7)-(4.8) is obvious. We stress <lb/>that in the second equation of (4.12), there holds (∇ P <lb/>h • ∇ D <lb/>h × ω) k = 0 for all inner dual cells <lb/>(k / <lb/>∈ Γ) but that this property might not necessarily be true for boundary dual cells (k ∈ Γ), <lb/>see Prop. 3.6. <lb/>Step 1 ends with the fact that (4.11) and (4.12) are well-posed: <lb/>Lemma 4.2. It was shown in [25, Proposition 5.2] that systems of types (4.11) and (4.12) both <lb/>have a unique solution. <lb/>Now, let us describe Step 2 of the calculations, which consists in solving for the velocity. <lb/></body>

			<body>That the right-hand sides of the above two equalities are identical follows from (4.5). <lb/>Further, because of (4.20), the right-hand sides in (4.16) must satisfy <lb/>i∈[1,I] <lb/>|T i |ω T <lb/>i = <lb/>k∈[1,K] <lb/>|P k |ω P <lb/>k = <lb/>j∈Γ <lb/>|A j |σ j . <lb/>(4.22) <lb/>For the set of conditions (4.9), the first two terms in (4.22) are equal to m ω and the last term <lb/>in (4.22) is equal to Γ σ(ξ) dξ. These two quantities are identical thanks to (4.6). <lb/>On the other hand, for the set of conditions (4.8), the values of the first two terms in (4.22) <lb/>are never imposed, but, rather, are results of the computations involved in the first step of our <lb/>procedure, see Eq. (4.11), so that the compatibility condition (4.22) may not be verified in <lb/>general. A possible way to overcome this problem is to change ω T <lb/>i into ω T <lb/>i + c T and ω P <lb/>k into <lb/>ω P <lb/>k +c P for all i ∈ [1, I +J Γ ] and all k ∈ [1, K] in (4.16), with two constants c T and c P computed <lb/>so that (4.22) holds.

			<body>Once these two subproblems have been solved, the vector u is then reconstructed by u j = <lb/>(∇ D <lb/>h φ) j + (∇ D <lb/>h × ψ) j . <lb/>5 Error estimates <lb/>Obtaining error estimates usually relies on regularity assumptions on the solution of the problem. <lb/>In order to apply results given in [25, 15], we shall assume more regularity on the vorticity and <lb/>pressure fields (ω, p) given by Proposition 5.1 below, and on the velocity potentials given by <lb/>Proposition 5.3 below. <lb/>Proposition 5.1. Let (f , g, σ, ω d ) belong to L 2 (Ω) <lb/>2 × H 1 (Ω) × H 1/2 (Γ) × H 1/2 (Γ), and let <lb/>(k q ) q∈[1,Q] be a set of given real numbers. Then, system (1.7)-(1.8)-(1.2)-(4.1) associated with <lb/>(4.5) may be split into two subproblems, where (p, ŵ) ∈ H 1 (Ω) <lb/>2 and a set of real numbers <lb/>(C q ) q∈[1,Q] are the exact solution of the Hodge decomposition of f + ∇g: <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>∇ × ω + ∇p = f + ∇g in Ω, <lb/>ω|Γ0 = ω d ; <lb/>ω|Γq = ω d + C q ∀ q ∈ [1, Q], <lb/>Ω p(x)dx = 0, <lb/>(5.1) <lb/>and, once ω has been determined, û ∈ Hdiv(Ω) ∩ Hcurl(Ω) solves the div-curl problem: <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>∇ • û = g in Ω, <lb/>∇ × û = ω in Ω, <lb/>û • n = σ on Γ, <lb/>Γq û • τ = k q , ∀q ∈ [1, Q]. <lb/>(5.2) <lb/>Hypothesis 5.2. We assume that ω and p given by Proposition 5.1 belong to H 2 (Ω). <lb/>The velocity field û solving (5.2) may be found by the following Hodge decomposition. <lb/>Proposition 5.3. Let (g, ω, σ) belong to H 1 (Ω) × H 2 (Ω) × H 1/2 (Γ), and let (k q ) q∈[1,Q] be a set <lb/>of given real numbers; let û be the exact solution of problem (5.2). Then, there exist φ and <lb/>ψ <lb/>both in H 1 (Ω) and a set of real numbers (C q ) q∈[1,Q] such that <lb/>û = ∇ φ + ∇ × ψ, <lb/>where φ and ψ are the solutions of <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>∆ φ = ∇ • û = g in Ω, <lb/>∇ φ • n = û • n = σ on Γ, <lb/>Ω φ = 0, <lb/>and <lb/>(5.3) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>−∆ ψ = ∇ × û = ω in Ω, <lb/>ψ|Γ0 = 0; ψ|Γq = C q ∀ q ∈ [1, Q], <lb/>Γq ∇ ψ • n = −k q . <lb/>(5.4) <lb/></body>

			<body>Proof. The Hodge decomposition of û and the determination of φ and ψ through (5.3) and (5.4) <lb/>are direct consequences of [39, Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.1]. <lb/>Hypothesis 5.4. We suppose that φ and ψ given by Proposition 5.3 belong to H 2 (Ω). <lb/>Due to re-entrant corners related to the internal polygonal boundaries Γ q , the H 2 regularity <lb/>of the potentials is not a consequence of the regularity of the data (g, ω, σ). <lb/>5.1 Error estimates in the H 1 semi-norm for the pressure and the <lb/>vorticity <lb/>Definition 5.5. For any continuous function v, we define Πv by <lb/>∀i ∈ [1, I + J Γ ], <lb/>(Πv) T <lb/>i = v(G i ), <lb/>∀k ∈ [1, K], <lb/>(Πv) P <lb/>k = v(S k ). <lb/>We note that, under Hypothesis 5.2, ω and p belong to H 2 (Ω), which implies they are <lb/>continuous on Ω, so that considering Πω and Πp makes sense. <lb/>Theorem 5.6. Let p and ω be the solutions of the numerical scheme (4.7)-(4.8), and let (p, ω) <lb/>be the exact solutions of (5.1). Then, if all diamond-cells are convex and under assumptions 2.1 <lb/>and 5.2, there exists a constant C(θ * ), independent of h, such that <lb/>||∇ D <lb/>h (p − Πp)|| D + ||∇ D <lb/>h (ω − Πω)|| D ≤ C(θ * ) h ( p 2,Ω + ω 2,Ω ). <lb/>(5.5) <lb/>Proof. Firstly, taking the mean-value of each term of the first line of Equ. (5.1) on a diamond <lb/>cell D j and using (4.10), we get: <lb/>1 <lb/>|D j | Dj <lb/>(∇p + ∇ × ω)(x)dx = f D <lb/>j + (∇g) D <lb/>j , ∀j ∈ [1, J]. <lb/>(5.6) <lb/>Then, since (5.6) and (4.7) have the same right-hand side, we infer that: <lb/>(∇ D <lb/>h p) j + (∇ D <lb/>h × ω) j = <lb/>1 <lb/>|D j | Dj <lb/>(∇p + ∇ × ω)(x)dx, ∀j ∈ [1, J]. <lb/>(5.7) <lb/>Setting <lb/>ε p := p − Πp and ε ω := ω − Πω, <lb/>(5.8) <lb/>Equ. (5.7) implies the following equality: <lb/>(∇ D <lb/>h ε p ) j + (∇ D <lb/>h × ε ω ) j = <lb/>1 <lb/>|D j | Dj <lb/>(∇p(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h Πp) j )dx <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>|D j | Dj <lb/>(∇ × ω(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j )dx, ∀j ∈ [1, J]. <lb/>(5.9) <lb/>According to (4.8) and the second line of (5.1), the error ε ω satisfies on the boundary <lb/>(ε ω ) T <lb/>i = 0 , ∀i ∈ Γ 0 , (ε ω ) T <lb/>i = c T <lb/>q − C q , ∀i ∈ Γ q , ∀q , <lb/>(ε ω ) P <lb/>k = 0 , ∀k ∈ Γ 0 , (ε ω ) P <lb/>k = c P <lb/>q − C q , ∀k ∈ Γ q , ∀q . <lb/>(5.10) <lb/></body>

			<body>Therefore, (∇ D <lb/>h ε p ) and (∇ D <lb/>h × ε ω ) are orthogonal for the scalar product (•, •) D , as recalled at <lb/>the end of Proposition 3.8. Consequently, multiplying (5.9) by |D j |(∇ D <lb/>h ε p ) j and summing for <lb/>all j ∈ [1, J], we obtain: <lb/>||∇ D <lb/>h ε p || 2 <lb/>D <lb/>= <lb/>j∈[1,J] Dj <lb/>(∇p(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h Πp) j ) • (∇ D <lb/>h ε p ) j dx <lb/>(5.11) <lb/>+ <lb/>j∈[1,J] Dj <lb/>(∇ × ω(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j ) • (∇ D <lb/>h ε p ) j dx. <lb/>In the very same way, multiplying (5.9) by |D j |(∇ D <lb/>h × ε ω ) j and summing for all j ∈ [1, J], we <lb/>obtain: <lb/>||∇ D <lb/>h ε ω || 2 <lb/>D <lb/>= <lb/>j∈[1,J] Dj <lb/>(∇p(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h Πp) j ) • (∇ D <lb/>h × ε ω ) j dx <lb/>(5.12) <lb/>+ <lb/>j∈[1,J] Dj <lb/>(∇ × ω(x) − (∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j ) • (∇ D <lb/>h × ε ω ) j dx. <lb/>The right-hand sides of (5.11) and (5.12) may be bounded using the traditional P 1 Lagrange <lb/>interpolations of p and ω on a submesh of the diamond mesh, obtained by splitting each diamond <lb/>cell, along any of its diagonals, into two triangles. The details of the calculations may be found <lb/>in [15], starting with inequality (62) of that reference, and then using Lemma 5.11, where the <lb/>norm in the right-hand side of inequality (66) has to be replaced by the H 2 (Ω) norm of p and <lb/>ω. <lb/>5.2 Error estimates in the L 2 -norm for the pressure and the vorticity <lb/>We shall use the discrete Poincaré inequalities recalled in Proposition 3.10 to infer error estimates <lb/>for the discrete L 2 norm of the errors in the pressure and the vorticity. <lb/>On the one hand, Proposition 3.10 can be applied directly to the error ε ω because it verifies <lb/>(5.10), which are exactly conditions (3.16) and (3.17) that Proposition 3.10 requires. Thus, we <lb/>infer from (5.5) the following theorem <lb/>Theorem 5.7. There exists a constant C(θ * ) that does not depend on h such that <lb/>||ω − Πω|| T,P ≤ C(θ * ) h ( p 2,Ω + ω 2,Ω ). <lb/>(5.13) <lb/>On the other hand, since (p − Πp) does not in general verify the vanishing mean-value <lb/>condition (3.15) (because Πp doesn&apos;t), we may not apply the discrete Poincaré inequality in a <lb/>straightforward way. However, defining <lb/>c T := <lb/>i∈[1,I] |T i |(Πp) T <lb/>i <lb/>|Ω| <lb/>, ( Πp) T <lb/>i := (Πp) T <lb/>i − c T , ∀i ∈ [1, I + J Γ ], <lb/>(5.14) <lb/>c P := <lb/>k∈[1,K] |P k |(Πp) P <lb/>k <lb/>|Ω| <lb/>, ( Πp) P <lb/>k := (Πp) P <lb/>k − c P , ∀k ∈ [1, K], <lb/>(5.15) <lb/></body>

			<body>we have that Πp verifies the vanishing mean-value condition (3.15) and <lb/>∇ D <lb/>h ( Πp) = ∇ D <lb/>h (Πp) <lb/>( 5 . 1 6 ) <lb/>because ( Πp) and (Πp) only differ by a constant on the primal and dual meshes, and defini-<lb/>tion (3.1) of the discrete gradient implies that this does not affect its values. Further, <lb/>||p − Πp|| T,P ≤ ||p − Πp|| T,P + ||Πp − Πp|| T,P . <lb/>(5.17) <lb/>Estimating the first term in the right-hand-side of (5.17) may be performed through the discrete <lb/>Poincaré inequality applied to (p − Πp). <lb/>Lemma 5.8. There exists a constant C(θ * ) that does not depend on h such that <lb/>||p − Πp|| T,P ≤ C(θ * ) h ( p 2,Ω + ω 2,Ω ). <lb/>(5.18) <lb/>Proof. From Prop. 3.10, it holds that <lb/>||p − Πp|| T,P ≤ * )||∇ D <lb/>h (p − Πp)|| D = C(θ * )||∇ D <lb/>h (p − Πp)|| D <lb/>(5.19) <lb/>because of (5.16). Applying (5.5), we get (5.18). <lb/>To estimate the second term in the right-hand-side of (5.17), we first recall (5.14) and (5.15). <lb/>This leads to <lb/>||Πp − Πp|| 2 <lb/>T,P = <lb/>|Ω| <lb/>2 <lb/>(c T ) 2 + (c P ) 2 . <lb/>(5.20) <lb/>Lemma 5.9. Let c T be defined by (5.14); then <lb/>|c T | ≤ |Ω| −1/2 <lb/>i <lb/>||p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ti) <lb/>1/2 <lb/>. <lb/>(5.21) <lb/>Proof. From (5.14), we have that <lb/>|Ω|c T = <lb/>i <lb/>|T i |(Πp) T <lb/>i = <lb/>i <lb/>Ti <lb/>(Πp) T <lb/>i − p (x)dx <lb/>because i Ti p(x)dx = Ω p(x)dx = 0. Then, a continuous and a discrete Cauchy-Schwarz <lb/>inequality lead to (5.21) through <lb/>|Ω||c T | ≤ <lb/>i <lb/>|T i | 1/2 ||p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || L 2 (Ti) ≤ |Ω| 1/2 <lb/>i <lb/>||p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ti) <lb/>1/2 <lb/>. <lb/>So, what remains to evaluate is the L 2 norm of (Πp) T <lb/>i − p on T i . <lb/>Lemma 5.10. There exists a constant C(θ * ) that does not depend on h such that <lb/>||p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || L 2 (Ti) ≤ C(θ * )h||p|| 2,Ti . <lb/>(5.22) <lb/></body>

			<body>Proof. First, we split the integral on the subtriangles t i,j,k with vertices G i M j S k (see Fig. 4), <lb/>where M j is the midpoint of the edge A j ⊂ ∂T i and S k one of its vertices: <lb/>Ti <lb/>(Πp) T <lb/>i − p <lb/>2 (x)dx = <lb/>t i,j,k ⊂Ti t i,j,k <lb/>(Πp) T <lb/>i − p <lb/>2 (x)dx. <lb/>(5.23) <lb/>Let π i,j,k p be the standard 1 Lagrange interpolation of p on t i,j,k . We have <lb/>||p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || 2 <lb/>L 2 (t i,j,k ) ≤ 2||(Πp) T <lb/>i − π i,j,k p|| 2 <lb/>L 2 (t i,j,k ) + 2||π i,j,k p − p|| 2 <lb/>L 2 (t i,j,k ) . <lb/>(5.24) <lb/>It is a standard result (see Theorem 3.1.5 of [40]) that there exists a constant C, not depending <lb/>on t i,j,k such that <lb/>||π i,j,k p − p|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) ≤ Cdiam(t i,j,k ) 2 ||p|| H 2 (t i,j,k ) , <lb/>(5.25) <lb/>which evaluates the second term in the right-hand side of (5.24). As far as the first term in the <lb/>right-hand side of (5.24) is concerned, since (Πp) T <lb/>i − π i,j,k p(G i ) = 0, and since π i,j,k p is a P 1 <lb/>function, we have that, for all x ∈ t i,j,k <lb/>(Πp) T <lb/>i − π i,j,k p(x) = ∇π i,j,k p • (G i − x), <lb/>which ensures that |(Πp) T <lb/>i − π i,j,k p(x)| ≤ diam(t i,j,k )||∇π i,j,k p|| for all x ∈ t i,j,k . Thus <lb/>||π i,j,k p − (Πp) T <lb/>i || L 2 (t i,j,k ) ≤ diam(t i,j,k )||∇π i,j,k p|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) . <lb/>(5.26) <lb/>Using the triangular inequality <lb/>||∇π i,j,k p|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) ≤ ||∇(π i,j,k p − p)|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) + ||∇p|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) <lb/>and using again Theorem 3.1.5 of [40], we have that there exists a constant C depending only <lb/>the regularity parameter of the subtriangulation (and thus on θ * ) such that <lb/>||∇π i,j,k p|| L 2 (t i,j,k ) ≤ (1 + Cdiam(t i,j,k ))||p|| H 2 (t i,j,k ) . <lb/>(5.27) <lb/>Gathering (5.23), (5.24), (5.25), (5.26) and (5.27) implies (5.22). <lb/>We are now able to estimate the second term in the right-hand side of (5.17) <lb/>Proposition 5.11. There exists a constant C(θ * ) that does not depend on h such that <lb/>||Πp − Πp|| T,P ≤ C(θ * ) h ||p|| 2,Ω . <lb/>(5.28) <lb/>Proof. Bounds (5.21) and (5.22) imply that <lb/>|c T | ≤ C(θ * )h||p|| 2,Ω . <lb/>(5.29) <lb/>Using (5.20), (5.29) and a similar bound that can be obtained in the same way for c P , we obtain <lb/>(5.28). <lb/>Finally, using (5.17), (5.18) and (5.28), we obtain the following theorem: <lb/>Theorem 5.12. There exists a constant C(θ * ) that does not depend on h such that <lb/>||p − Πp|| T,P ≤ C(θ * ) h ( p 2,Ω + ω 2,Ω ). <lb/>(5.30) <lb/></body>

			<body>Proof. We use the discrete Hodge decomposition (see Proposition 3.8) of d u into ∇ D <lb/>h φ d + <lb/>∇ D <lb/>h × ψ d . Using Proposition 4.3, we get that φ d vanishes. Next, performing like in the proof <lb/>of Theorem 4.1 in [35], we obtain ||d u || 2 <lb/>D = (∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u , ψ d ) T,P . By definition of the scalar <lb/>product (3.6), and using the second line in (5.34), it holds that <lb/>(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u , ψ d ) T,P = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>i∈[1,I] <lb/>|T i |(d ω ) T <lb/>i (ψ d ) T <lb/>i + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>k / <lb/>∈Γ <lb/>|P k |(d ω ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>k∈Γ0 <lb/>|P k |(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k + <lb/>q∈[1,Q] <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>k∈Γq <lb/>|P k |(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k . <lb/>(5.36) <lb/>Using boundary condition (3.16) for ψ d , we obtain <lb/>k∈Γ0 <lb/>|P k |(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k = 0 = <lb/>k∈Γ0 <lb/>|P k |(d ω ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k . <lb/>(5.37) <lb/>Moreover, using boundary condition (3.17) and the last line in (5.34), we obtain <lb/>k∈Γq <lb/>|P k |(∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k = <lb/>k∈Γq <lb/>|P k |(d ω ) P <lb/>k (ψ d ) P <lb/>k . <lb/>(5.38) <lb/>Thus, gathering (5.36), (5.37), (5.38), and recalling that ||∇ D <lb/>h × ψ d || 2 <lb/>D = ||d u || 2 <lb/>D = (∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× <lb/>d u , ψ d ) T,P , we get <lb/>||∇ D <lb/>h × ψ d || 2 = (∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× d u , ψ d ) T,P = (d ω , ψ d ) T,P . <lb/>(5.39) <lb/>Using (5.39), the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (d ω , ψ d ) T,P ≤ ||d ω || T,P ||ψ d || T,P and the discrete <lb/>Poincaré inequality (3.22) for ψ d , allow us to conclude. <lb/>Next, it remains to estimate d ω . We first link ||ω − ω || T,P to a previous result by the <lb/>triangle inequality <lb/>||ω − ω || T,P ≤ ||ω − Πω|| T,P + || ω − Πω|| T,P . <lb/>(5.40) <lb/>The first term in the right-hand side of (5.40) is bounded by (5.13).

			<body>Since ω T <lb/>i − (Πω) T <lb/>i is a constant on T i , we have <lb/>|T i | ω T <lb/>i − (Πω) T <lb/>i <lb/>2 <lb/>= <lb/>Ti <lb/>ω T <lb/>i − (Πω) T <lb/>i <lb/>2 dx <lb/>≤ 2 ||ω − ω T <lb/>i || 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ti) + ||ω − (Πω) T <lb/>i || 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ti) . <lb/>(5.43) <lb/>Using arguments similar to those that led to (5.22), we have that <lb/>||ω − (Πω) T <lb/>i || L 2 (Ti) ≤ Ch||ω|| 2,Ti . <lb/>(5.44) <lb/>Since T i is an open bounded set which is star-shaped with respect to G i , there exists a constant <lb/>C(T i ) only depending on the shape of T i , but not on its diameter such that <lb/>ω − ω T <lb/>i L 2 (Ti) ≤ C(T i )diam(T i ) ∇ω L 2 (Ti) . <lb/>(5.45) <lb/>Since T i is convex, a universal constant C(T i ) is given by 1 <lb/>π , see [41]. Since any dual cell P k is <lb/>star-shaped with respect to S k , a similar inequality holds: <lb/>ω − ω P <lb/>k L 2 (P k ) ≤ C(P k )diam(P k ) ∇ω L 2 (P k ) . <lb/>(5.46) <lb/>However, since P k is not necessarily convex, the estimation of C(P k ) is less obvious, but we <lb/>may use explicitly computable formulas given, for example, by [42, 43]. These formulas show <lb/>that C(P k ) only depend on the angles of the subtriangulation mentioned in Hyp. 2.1. Gathering <lb/>(5.43), (5.44) and (5.45), and similar inequalities on the dual cells P k , the upper bound (5.41) <lb/>is obtained from (5.42). <lb/>Now, we are able to estimate the first term in the right-hand side of (5.32). With (5.40), <lb/>(5.13) and (5.41), we obtain from (5.35) the following proposition: <lb/>Proposition 5.16. Under hypotheses 2.1 and 5.2, there exists a constant C(θ * ) independent <lb/>of h such that <lb/>||u − ũ|| D ≤ C(θ * )h ( ω 2,Ω + p 2,Ω ) . <lb/>(5.47) <lb/>Finally, plugging (5.47) and (5.33) into (5.32) leads to the following theorem <lb/>Theorem 5.17. If all diamond cells are convex and under hypotheses 2.1, 5.2 and 5.4, there <lb/>exists a constant C(θ * ) independent of h such that <lb/>||u h − û|| 0,Ω ≤ C(θ * )h <lb/>ω 2,Ω + p 2,Ω + ||g|| 0,Ω + || φ|| 2,Ω + || ψ|| 2,Ω . <lb/>(5.48) <lb/>Remark 5.18. The convergence results obtained in this section are valid on any mesh; however, <lb/>on some type of meshes, it is possible to prove some superconverge results. They will not be proved <lb/>here, but it may be shown that if ω and p given by Proposition 5.1 belong to H 3 (Ω), then, on <lb/>families of meshes such that there exists a finite number L of sub-domains (Ω ) ∈[1,L] included in <lb/>Ω and independent of the mesh step h, such that the diamond-cells which are not parallelograms <lb/>are included in strips δ , having width Ch and located along the boundaries of the various Ω , <lb/>where C is a constant independent of h, then ||∇ D <lb/>h (p−Πp)|| D and ||∇ D <lb/>h (ω−Πω)|| D both converge <lb/></body>

In that case, each mesh of rectangles is an Ω . Another example of such <lb/>families of meshes is what is called &quot;homothetically refined triangular meshes&quot;, obtained from a <lb/>coarse triangular mesh by iteratively refining each triangle into four homothetic sub-triangles by <lb/>joining the midpoints of its edges. In that case, each triangle of the coarse mesh is an Ω . <lb/>6 Numerical results <lb/>In this section, we first test the finite volume method applied to the vorticity-velocity-pressure <lb/>formulation against known analytical solutions and plot convergence curves (in log-log scale) for <lb/>several quantities; then we consider the Bercovier-Engelman [44] as well as the Ruas [45] test <lb/>case. <lb/>6.1 Convergence curves <lb/>First, the data are chosen so that the exact solution is <lb/>û = (exp(x) cos(πy), x sin(πy) + cos(πx)) <lb/>T <lb/>and p = xy exp(x) cos(πy). <lb/>(6.1) <lb/>The boundary conditions are those given by (4.1). <lb/>Three families of increasingly fine meshes are used. The first is a family of standard triangular <lb/>meshes, used on the non-simply connected domain Ω =] − 1/2; 1/2[ 2 \] − 1/6; 1/6[ 2 , see Fig. 6. <lb/>The second and third families are nonconforming meshes used on the domain Ω =] − 1/2; 1/2[ 2 . <lb/>The second family has very localized non-conformities, see Fig. 7, and is obtained in the following <lb/>way: the first mesh is obtained by dividing the domain into 8 × 8 identical squares, and the 4 <lb/>squares at the center of the mesh are further refined into 4×4 sub-squares. Then, the subsequent <lb/>meshes are obtained by dividing each cell of the previous mesh into 2 × 2 square cells. The third <lb/>family has non-conformities spread over the entire domain, see Fig. 8, since every other cell is <lb/>refined into 4 × 4 sub-cells. Of course, the third family of meshes is not of practical use but <lb/>illustrates well the ability of the scheme to deal with heavily non-conforming meshes. <lb/>We have proved (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2) that p, ω, as well as their gradients converge to the <lb/>exact solution of the Stokes problem. We are thus interested here in the numerical convergence <lb/>of p, ∇ D <lb/>h p, ω and ∇ D <lb/>h ω, which we measure by the following errors <lb/>(e0p)(h) := <lb/>||p − Πp|| T,P <lb/>||Πp|| T,P <lb/>and (e1p) 2 (h) := <lb/>j |D j | |(∇ D <lb/>h p) j − (Π∇p) j | 2 <lb/>j |D j | |(Π∇p) j | 2 <lb/>, <lb/>where ∀j ∈ [1, J], (Π∇p) j = (∇p)(B j ), where B j is the center of gravity of the diamond cell <lb/>D j . The same definitions hold for ω by replacing p by ω in the previous formulae. From the <lb/>numerical results given in [15], we may expect second-order accuracy for p and ω (although <lb/>we were able to prove only first-order accuracy in section 5), and first-order accuracy for ∇ D <lb/>h p <lb/>and ∇ D <lb/>h ω on general meshes. However, on meshes with diamond-cells which are almost all <lb/></body>

			<body>parallelograms, which is the case for the second family of meshes, we expect a convergence order <lb/>of 1.5 for ∇ D <lb/>h p and ∇ D <lb/>h ω. <lb/>We also proved the convergence of the velocity field u to the exact solution. The discrete <lb/>relative L 2 error on the diamond cells for the velocity is measured by: <lb/>e 2 (h) := <lb/>j |D j | |u j − (Πû) j | 2 <lb/>j |D j | |(Πû) j | 2 , <lb/>where (Πû) j is the value of the exact solution û at the midpoint M j of the edge A j : <lb/>∀j ∈ [1, J], (Πû) j = û(M j ). <lb/>We expect first-order convergence of the velocity field on general meshes like those of the first and <lb/>third families. On the second family of meshes, since almost all diamond cells are parallelograms, <lb/>we may expect from the numerical results of [25] an order of convergence of at least 1.5. In <lb/>Finite Element methods, one is also usually concerned with the convergence of ∇u, since u <lb/>belongs to H 1 (Ω) and since the term Ω ∇u : ∇vdx appears in the bilinear form associated <lb/>with the variational formulation of the Stokes problem. In our formulation, the natural norm <lb/>induced by the variational formulation is ||∇ • u|| 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ω) + ||∇ × u|| 2 <lb/>L 2 (Ω) <lb/>1/2 <lb/>. Since ∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>• u is <lb/>always exactly imposed through the first equation of (4.15) or (4.16), we measure the errors on <lb/>the derivatives of u through the error on ω = ∇ T,P <lb/>h <lb/>× u. <lb/>6.1.1 Triangular meshes <lb/>We first consider standard triangular meshes, as shown in Fig. 6. On this type of meshes, ∇ D <lb/>h p <lb/>and ∇ D <lb/>h ω are all first-order accurate, while p, ω and u are second-order accurate, as displayed in <lb/>Fig. 6. Apart from u which displays superconverge, these are the expected orders of convergence. <lb/>10 <lb/>−1 <lb/>10 <lb/>−6 <lb/>10 <lb/>−5 <lb/>10 <lb/>−4 <lb/>10 <lb/>−3 <lb/>10 <lb/>−2 <lb/>10 <lb/>−1 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>h <lb/>e1p(h) <lb/>e0p(h) <lb/>e(h) <lb/>e1ω(h) <lb/>e0ω(h) <lb/>slope=2 <lb/>slope=1 <lb/>Figure 6: Left: Triangular mesh.

Moreover, as far as u is concerned, we observe in practice an order of <lb/>convergence which is better than expected since it is slightly lower than 2.

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>y = 1, while f = (f 1 , f 2 ) T with <lb/>f 1 (x, y) = 256 x 2 (x − 1) 2 (12y − 6) + y(y − 1)(2y − 1)(12x 2 − 12x + 2) + (y − 1/2) <lb/>f 2 (x, y) = −f 1 (y, x) <lb/>The exact solution is ω = 256 y 2 (y − 1) 2 (6x 2 − 6x + 1) + x 2 (x − 1) 2 (6y 2 − 6y + 1) , p = (x − <lb/>1/2)(y − 1/2) and u = (u 1 , u 2 ) T with <lb/>u 1 (x, y) = −256y(y − 1)(2y − 1)x 2 (x − 1) 2 <lb/>u 2 (x, y) = −u 1 (y, x). <lb/>This test case is interesting because in the source term f , the component related to ∇ × ω is <lb/>much larger in magnitude as that related to ∇p, and thus one may wish to know if a numerical <lb/>scheme is able to calculate the pressure field correctly. This is indeed the case as may be seen <lb/>from the results displayed on Figure 9 which were computed on a triangular mesh with around <lb/>63000 triangles. <lb/>Figure 9: Bercovier-Engelman test. Left: pressure contours (expected extrema : −1/4 and 1/4, <lb/>computed extrema: −0.24989 and 0.25003). Center: velocity field. Right: vorticity contours <lb/>(expected extrema : −16 and 16, computed extrema: −16.001 and 16). <lb/>6.3 The Ruas test-case <lb/>The domain of computation is the unit circle, we use u • n = 0 on the boundary, where we <lb/>also prescribe the value of the exact vorticity ω = 32 − 16(x 2 + y 2 ). Setting f = ∇ × ω and <lb/>g = 0 yields that p = 0. This test is interesting because a numerical method will compute a <lb/>discrete pressure which will be, in general, different from 0, and thus one wishes to know the <lb/>magnitude of this spurious pressure. However, in the DDFV framework, we wish to emphasize <lb/>that there is a way of prescribing the right-hand side f j on each diamond-cell D j in the discrete <lb/>Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (Step 1 of our procedure) such that the discrete values p and <lb/>ω computed by our scheme are exactly equal to 0 and Πω, respectively. Indeed, instead of using <lb/></body>

			<body>(4.10), we define f D <lb/>j by its scalar products with n j and n j in the following way <lb/>f D <lb/>j • n j = <lb/>1 <lb/>|A j | Aj <lb/>f • n j dσ and f D <lb/>j • n j = <lb/>1 <lb/>|A j | <lb/>A j1 <lb/>f • n j1 dσ + <lb/>A j2 <lb/>f • n j2 dσ . <lb/>(6.2) <lb/>Then since <lb/>Aj <lb/>f • n j = <lb/>Aj <lb/>(∇ × ω) • n j = <lb/>Aj <lb/>(∇ω) • τ j = ω(S k1 ) − ω(S k2 ) = |A j |(∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j • n j <lb/>and, in the same way <lb/>A j1 <lb/>f • n j1 dσ + <lb/>A j2 <lb/>f • n j2 dσ = (ω(M j ) − ω(G i1 )) + (ω(G i2 ) − ω(M j )) <lb/>= ω(G i2 ) − ω(G i1 ) = |A j |(∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j • n j , <lb/>we have that f j = (∇ D <lb/>h × Πω) j for all j; then it follows from the uniqueness of the discrete <lb/>Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the discrete f that ω i,k = (Πω) i,k and p T,P <lb/>i,k = 0. Of course, <lb/>defining f D <lb/>j by (6.2) requires the calculations of the 1D integrals along the edges; this may be <lb/>performed by numerical quadrature, up to a user-defined precision. In the Ruas test case, since <lb/>f is a P 1 function, the midpoint rule is enough to calculate the integrals exactly. We checked <lb/>that the computed vorticity is exactly equal to Πω and that the computed pressure vanishes, up <lb/>to the linear solver precision. The vorticity and the velocity fields are displayed on Figure 10. <lb/>Figure 10: Ruas test. Left: velocity field. Right: vorticity contours. <lb/>7 Conclusion <lb/>We have proposed a discrete duality finite volume method for the two-dimensional Stokes equa-<lb/>tions with the non-standard boundary conditions (4.1) to (4.4). These non-standard boundary <lb/></body>

			<body>conditions are treated through the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation of the Stokes equa-<lb/>tions, for which the finite volume method was successfully applied over unstructured and non-<lb/>conforming meshes. Numerical results show a first-order convergence for the velocity, the pres-<lb/>sure gradient and the vorticity gradient and a second order convergence for the pressure and <lb/>the vorticity, while a superconvergence order of 1.5 for the pressure gradient and the vortic-<lb/>ity gradient and an order two for the velocity are obtained on regular (but possibly locally <lb/>non-conforming) meshes. Some of these convergence orders were proved through the theoreti-<lb/>cal analysis we led in this paper, while only suboptimal orders were obtained for pressure and <lb/>vorticity on general meshes and for velocity on regular meshes. <lb/></body>
