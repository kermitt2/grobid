            <body>1. <lb/> INTRODUCTION <lb/>The substitution of Pr in R-123 (R = <lb/>rare earth) and related systems has been widely <lb/>studied, for its role in suppressing <lb/>superconductivity either due to hybridization <lb/>between Pr (4f) and conducting CuO 2 (2p) <lb/>plane leading to localization of mobile charge <lb/>carriers and/or hole filling by fluctuating <lb/>valence of Pr (3+ or 4+) at rare earth or even at <lb/>Ba (Barium) site [1-5]. Even though many <lb/>studies have been carried out on these <lb/>compounds, yet the correct explanation for <lb/>such a phenomenon is still a matter of debate. <lb/>Majority of Pr substituted R-123 and derived <lb/>systems have shown decrease in T c with <lb/>increasing Pr concentration. The Pr-substituted <lb/>R-123 compounds also show rare earth ion <lb/>effect and for every x cr (critical Pr <lb/>concentration) with respect to the R ion, <lb/>superconductivity is totally suppressed [6, 7]. <lb/>Our <lb/>studies <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>La 2-<lb/>x R x Ca y Ba 2 Cu 4+y O z (La-2125) type of R-123 <lb/>derived compounds have shown enhancement <lb/>in T c with increasing x, with maximum T c ~ 78 <lb/>K achieved with different R, for x = 0.5 <lb/>compound [8,9]. It has been established that T c <lb/>is related to the hole concentration in Cu-O <lb/>sheets (p sh ) [10]. By adding equal amounts of <lb/>CaO and CuO in non-superconducting, <lb/>tetragonal <lb/>La Ba 2 Cu 4 O z <lb/>(x <lb/>= <lb/>0.0), <lb/>superconductivity is &apos;turned on&apos; with <lb/>maximum T c achieved for x = 0.5 (La-2125) <lb/>compound. <lb/>In R-123 systems, magnetic moment <lb/>of R does not contribute to superconducting <lb/>properties, except for Ce, Tb and Pr [11]. Pr-<lb/>substituted <lb/>systems <lb/>become <lb/>non-<lb/>superconductor above x cr , where as, in the <lb/>present study we observe increase in T c in with <lb/>increase in Pr concentration. <lb/>2. <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL <lb/>All the samples of LaPrCaBCO series <lb/>(x = 0.1 -0.5) were synthesized by solid state <lb/>reaction method. The high purity (99.9+ %) <lb/>starting compounds of La O 3 , BaCO 3 , CaCO 3 , <lb/>CuO and Pr 6 O 11 were taken in stoichiometric <lb/>quantities and grinded thoroughly using agate <lb/>and mortar under acetone. The calcination and <lb/>sintering of these compounds were carried out <lb/>in pellet form in the temperature range of 930 <lb/>-940 0 C for about 72 hrs with intermediate <lb/>grindings. Thus prepared samples were <lb/>annealed in oxygen at 500 C for about 24 hrs <lb/>and then slow cooled to room temperature. <lb/>The samples were characterized for <lb/>their structural properties by X-ray diffraction <lb/>(Cu-K α , λ = 1.5405 Å) at room temperature. <lb/>All the XRD patterns show single phase <lb/>formation. The patterns were then fitted by <lb/>Rietveld analysis using FULLPROF program <lb/>[12]. The results show that there is no <lb/>structural transition in the entire doping range, <lb/>as all the samples are tetragonal, with <lb/>decreasing unit cell parameters and volume. <lb/>The transition temperature were recorded by <lb/>four probe d. c. resistivity method and verified <lb/>by d. c. susceptibility method, using a <lb/>commercial SQUID magnetometer. Both the <lb/>values are in good agreement, showing the <lb/>good quality of samples. The oxygen content <lb/>for all the samples were determined by <lb/>iodometric double titration method. The hole <lb/>concentration in the unit cell, and also in Cu-O <lb/>sheets were calculated from oxygen content <lb/>values using Tokura&apos;s method [13]. <lb/>3. <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>The XRD Rietveld fitted patterns are <lb/>shown in Figure 1. The refinement was done <lb/>assuming an R-123 tetragonal unit cell and all <lb/>the patterns fits well into this model. The <lb/>occupancies were kept fixed, as per the site <lb/>occupancy, and the fitting parameters like, <lb/>scale factor, zero angle correction, atomic <lb/>positions, half width parameters, unit cell <lb/>parameters etc were varied to fit the observed <lb/>and calculated profiles. The results of the <lb/>analysis are listed in Table 1. Figure 2 shows <lb/>the variation of unit cell parameters and <lb/>volume with respect to increasing x. The <lb/>decrease in unit cell parameters and cell <lb/>volume can be attributed to the fact that, <lb/>smaller ionic radii ions Pr and Ca are replacing <lb/>La. <lb/>Since the starting model was assumed <lb/>to be an R-123 tetragonal structure, the <lb/>LaPrCaBCO (x = 0.1 -0.5) were normalized <lb/>to La-123. In this normalized form, La shares <lb/>its site with both Pr and Ca; similarly Ba site is <lb/>occupied by Ba, Ca and La. Increasing x, <lb/>increases the percentage of Ca onto La and La <lb/>onto Ba site. During initial refinements, Pr was <lb/>kept full and fixed at La site. The refinement <lb/>converged with good agreement between <lb/>observed and calculated patterns. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 1. XRD Rietveld fitted pattern for all the <lb/>samples. The open circles represent data <lb/>points, and the line passing through them <lb/>shows calculated pattern. The difference <lb/>between observed and calculated pattern is <lb/>shown for x = 0.5 sample <lb/>Fig.2. Variation in unit cell parameters and <lb/>volume with increasing Pr (x) content. <lb/>Subsequent refinements with Pr <lb/>distributed at both La and Ba site did not <lb/>improve the fitting. Hence, Pr was kept full <lb/>and fixed at La site during final analysis. There <lb/>is also concomitant displacement of La onto <lb/>Ba site. The Ca occupying La site and La onto <lb/>Ba site can be viewed as hole doping and hole <lb/>filling respectively. Also there is some portion <lb/>of Ca at Ba site, which we assume may be <lb/>counter balancing the hole filling by La. <lb/>Looking at Table 1, out of total Ca in the <lb/>sample, the Ca concentration increases from 35 <lb/>% (for x = 0.1) to 68% (x = 0.5) at La site. The <lb/>occupancy of Ca at La site increases from 39% <lb/>-41 %. <lb/>Fig. 3. <lb/>Transition temperatures for <lb/>La 2-x Pr x Ca y Ba 2 Cu 4+y O z compounds determined <lb/>by resistivity and susceptibility as a function of <lb/>temperature. <lb/>Figure 3 shows the transition <lb/>temperatures observed by electrical (resistance <lb/>vs. temperature) and magnetic (susceptibility <lb/>vs. temperature) methods. It is interesting to <lb/>observe here that, with increasing Ca <lb/>concentration at La site (as x increases), <lb/>transition temperature increases, as can be seen <lb/>in Figure 4. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 4. Variation in T c with increasing x, for <lb/>R = Nd, Dy and Pr in La 2-x R x Ca y Ba 2 Cu 4+y O z <lb/>The Figure 4 also shows, for the sake <lb/>of comparison, the increase in T c for Nd and <lb/>Dy substituted La-2125 compounds. The <lb/>difference in maximum T c achieved by Pr and <lb/>Nd &amp; Dy systems is quite large (~ 20 K). <lb/>Fig. 5. Change in oxygen content and hole <lb/>concentration in sheets (p sh ). <lb/>The Pr is known to hybridize with <lb/>conducting CuO 2 plane and localize the mobile <lb/>charge carriers. On the other hand, Ca is a <lb/>known hole dopant in R-123 systems. In <lb/>LaPrCaBCO system also, increasing x, <lb/>increases <lb/>oxygen <lb/>content <lb/>and <lb/>hole <lb/>concentration, as shown in Figure 5. Thus, we <lb/>can feel that the rise in T c (but not up to <lb/>maximum of La-2125 system i.e., ~ 78K) in <lb/>LaPrCaBCO <lb/>is due to the competition <lb/>between hole filling and/or hybridization and <lb/>hole doping which results from the <lb/>simultaneous increase of both Pr and Ca with <lb/>x. <lb/>4. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>The studies on LaPrCaBCO system, <lb/>presents a unique case of increase in T c with <lb/>the simultaneous increase of both Pr and Ca. <lb/>The present study also highlights the role of Ca <lb/>in contributing conducting holes to, otherwise <lb/>non-superconductor, and &apos;turning on&apos; the <lb/>superconductivity. The present result of <lb/>increase in T c with x is in consistence with our <lb/>earlier observations, for different R, except for <lb/>the maximum T c achieved. We feel that <lb/>LaPrCaBCO <lb/>compounds <lb/>are <lb/>possible <lb/>candidates for further investigations in better <lb/>understanding for the actual role Pr in high T c <lb/>oxides. <lb/></body>
