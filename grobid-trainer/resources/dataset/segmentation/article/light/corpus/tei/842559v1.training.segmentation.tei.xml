The Riverfly Partnership has been <lb/>supporting a growing network of citizen science volunteers monitoring aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers <lb/>and streams across the United Kingdom since 2004. In Manchester, Salford and surrounding areas, Riverfly <lb/>Partnership monitoring began in 2011 with volunteers from a catchment-wide fishing club. This provided a <lb/>catalyst for broader public engagement, wider environmental projects, and the establishment of a new <lb/>grassroots environmental charity. The vigilance of the network demonstrated its value by flagging a major <lb/>pollution event wiping out all macroinvertebrates along 19 km of the River Irwell in April 2017. By <lb/>evaluating monitoring data and the citizen science program&apos;s impacts, we identify key lessons for taking <lb/>forward public engagement in river catchment management both in Greater Manchester and elsewhere. <lb/>Keywords: citizen science; urban rivers; macroinvertebrates; pollution <lb/></front>

			<body>1 INTRODUCTION <lb/>1.1 Macroinvertebrates as bioindicators <lb/>The macroinvertebrates living amongst vegetation <lb/>and within or on the sediment of rivers provide a <lb/>valuable resource for the assessment of a wide <lb/>range of aquatic parameters (Armitage et al. 1983; <lb/>Hawkes 1998; Everard 2008). With the long <lb/>residence time of individuals (typically one to <lb/>three years), the macroinvertebrate community <lb/>acts in effect as a data logger: its composition <lb/>indicates the long-term average of water quality <lb/>and whether the site experiences occasional <lb/>intense pollution episodes. Macroinvertebrates <lb/>can also indicate the flow regime and habitat and <lb/>substrate parameters (Extence et al. 1999; <lb/>Glendell et al. 2014). <lb/>Biological monitoring of rivers with <lb/>macroinvertebrates is used worldwide from <lb/>Europe and the Americas to Africa and Australasia <lb/>(Smith et al. 1999; Bonada et al. 2006; Ollis et al. <lb/>2006; Shull &amp; Lookenbill 2007; Birk et al. 2012). <lb/>Rigorous statutory monitoring was developed in <lb/>the UK through the 1970 National River Pollution <lb/>Survey (Hawkes 1998) and subsequent BMWP <lb/>(Biological Monitoring Working Party) system, <lb/>which scores taxa on a scale 1-10 based on their <lb/>tolerance to pollution (Armitage et al. 1983). Each <lb/>taxon identified in a sample is scored and the <lb/>BMWP score is the total of the taxa scores. A <lb/>further development was Average Score Per <lb/>Taxon (ASPT), which is the BMWP cumulative <lb/>score divided by the number of taxa and hence a <lb/>measure of the average pollution tolerance of the <lb/>sample (Everall et al. 2017). The ASPT limits both <lb/>the influence of sampling effort (larger samples <lb/>are likely to include more families, which increases <lb/>the BMWP score) and the skewing effect of an <lb/>outlier. <lb/>The macroinvertebrate sampling technique used <lb/>in statutory monitoring in the UK is that of a <lb/></body>

			<body>semi-quantitative kick sample (UKTAG 2008). A <lb/>standardized net catches macroinvertebrates <lb/>dislodged by an operative disturbing the substrate <lb/>with the feet for a fixed period of time, taking a <lb/>zigzag route across the river to ensure that all <lb/>habitats are included (Furse et al. 1981; Armitage <lb/>et al. 1983). The same sampling technique can be <lb/>employed with minimal training by the general <lb/>public and is therefore readily used in citizen <lb/>science monitoring programs. Assessment of <lb/>samples by BMWP or ASPT scoring, however, <lb/>requires a professional level of taxonomic <lb/>expertise to identify 84 families of <lb/>macroinvertebrates plus the Class Oligochaeta <lb/>(Hawkes 1998). <lb/>1.2 Riverfly Partnership citizen science <lb/>Macroinvertebrates are of particular interest to <lb/>anglers because of their influence on fish <lb/>distributions (Wallace &amp; Webster 1996) and the <lb/>use of macroinvertebrate imitations (&quot;flies&quot;) to <lb/>catch fish such as salmon and trout. The Riverfly <lb/>Partnership identified anglers as the focus <lb/>constituency for citizen science monitoring of river <lb/>macroinvertebrates when it began in 2004 with <lb/>collaboration between the Freshwater Biological <lb/>Association, the Natural History Museum London, <lb/>the Salmon &amp; Trout Association (now known as <lb/>Salmon &amp; Trout Conservation UK) and other <lb/>interested parties. <lb/>The Riverfly Partnership&apos;s Anglers&apos; Riverfly <lb/>Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) index uses a selection <lb/>of the moderately tolerant to pollution sensitive <lb/>BMWP families (BMWP values 4-10) placed into 8 <lb/>groups for simplified identification in a live sample <lb/>(Riverfly Partnership, http://www.riverflies.org ; Di <lb/>Fiore &amp; Fitch 2016). The ARMI index does not <lb/>distinguish between pollution tolerances of the 8 <lb/>groups (each is treated equivalently in the scoring <lb/>formula) but does place a weighting on the <lb/>abundance of each group, estimated as <lb/>logarithmic categories. The ARMI score is the total <lb/>of the abundance scores for the eight groups: zero <lb/>individuals of a group scores 0; 1-9 scores 1; 10-99 <lb/>scores 2; 100-999 scores 3; and 1000 or more <lb/>scores 4. The simplified target groups, live sorting <lb/>and broad abundance categories make riverside <lb/>sampling and processing accessible to <lb/>non-scientist trainees with a one day training <lb/>course. Sample processing can be on the riverside: <lb/>identification is straightforward; equipment <lb/>requirements are simple; no preservatives are <lb/>needed; and estimate of numbers is quicker and <lb/>easier than counts to the last individual. <lb/>1.3 The context of Greater Manchester&apos;s rivers <lb/>Manchester, recognized as the world&apos;s first <lb/>industrial city, has a long history of polluted rivers <lb/>(Burton 2003). The influence of its industrial past <lb/>is still seen today with continuing leachate of <lb/>heavy metal contaminants into the River Irwell <lb/>(Hurley et al. 2017), which is 63 km long and <lb/>drains a catchment of 701 km 2 including much of <lb/>Greater Manchester. Water quality improvements <lb/>during the 20 th Century along the River Irwell and <lb/>the River Mersey into which it flows downriver of <lb/>Manchester were boosted from 1985 by the UK <lb/>government initiated Mersey Basin Campaign <lb/>(Gregory et al. 2011). <lb/>However, continuing episodic pollution events of <lb/>raw sewage released by combined sewer <lb/>overflows following heavy rainfall plus industrial <lb/>discharges remain an ongoing concern of local <lb/>recreational anglers in close contact with the <lb/>rivers in and around the Greater Manchester <lb/>conurbation. Incidences of fish death suspected to <lb/>be connected with sewage and industrial <lb/>discharges led to the Salford Friendly Anglers&apos; <lb/>Society (SFAS) joining the Riverfly Partnership&apos;s <lb/>citizen science program in September 2011. <lb/>The SFAS was founded in April 1817 and is an <lb/>example of the &quot;friendly societies&quot; of 18 th and 19 th <lb/>Century Britain, which were social and insurance <lb/>clubs usually for people sharing common interests <lb/>such as angling (Cordery 1995; Gorsky 1998). <lb/>Legislative changes in the 1890s meant the <lb/>financial role ceased but the SFAS continued as a <lb/>fishing club; it is today an organized group of <lb/>anglers focused on fishing the River Irwell and its <lb/>tributaries. Free membership, free fishing and <lb/>other free activities are a central tenet of the SFAS <lb/>to maximize engagement and ensure accessibility <lb/>for social deprived communities around the urban <lb/>stretches of the river. <lb/></body>

			<body>1.4 This study <lb/>There has been a growing consensus that citizen <lb/>science monitoring can make important <lb/>contributions to management aimed at improving <lb/>water quality and in responses to pollution <lb/>incidents (Latimore &amp; Steen 2014; Shupe 2016; <lb/>Shuker et al. 2017). <lb/>This study tests the hypothesis that citizen science <lb/>can both inform and catalyze river improvements <lb/>by assessing the Riverfly Partnership citizen <lb/>science program in and around the urban <lb/>conurbation of Greater Manchester. The vigilance <lb/>of the network and its responsiveness is <lb/>demonstrated with volunteer-led identification of <lb/>the location of a pollution event causing a <lb/>large-scale macroinvertebrate kill along 19 km of <lb/>the River Irwell in April 2017. <lb/>The capacity for citizen science engagement of <lb/>communities to catalyze river improvements is <lb/>demonstrated by restoration and rehabilitation <lb/>projects that have emerged alongside and by the <lb/>formation of a new grassroots environmental <lb/>charity. We examine the challenges the program <lb/>has faced and continues to face, the lessons <lb/>learnt, and recommendations to guide future <lb/>citizen science work monitoring and reporting on <lb/>river health in Manchester and beyond. <lb/>2 METHODS <lb/>2.1 Macroinvertebrate sampling, biotic indices <lb/>and laboratory methods <lb/>Macroinvertebrate kick samples were taken for a <lb/>cumulative three minutes along a 10-20 m length <lb/>of river, sampling habitats and substrates <lb/>proportional to their abundance, plus a one <lb/>minute search of larger stones for attached <lb/>macroinvertebrates. Riverfly Partnership ARMI <lb/>scoring (Riverfly Partnership, <lb/>http://www.riverflies.org ; Di Fiore &amp; Fitch 2016) <lb/>recorded 8 groups of macroinvertebrates: cased <lb/>caddis (Trichoptera); caseless caddis (Trichoptera); <lb/>true mayfly (Ephemeridae); flat-bodied mayfly <lb/>(Heptageniidae); blue-winged olives <lb/>(Ephemerellidae); olives (Baetidae); stoneflies <lb/>(Plecoptera); and freshwater shrimp ( Gammarus <lb/>spp.). BMWP and ASPT scoring (Whalley &amp; <lb/>Hawkes 1996) recorded all macroinvertebrates, <lb/>except oligochaetes, to family level using Croft <lb/>(1986) and Mellanby (1963). Autumn was defined <lb/>for data handling following UKTAG (2014) as 1 st <lb/>September to 30 th November. <lb/>2.2 Sampling sites <lb/>Eleven sites along the River Irwell from <lb/>Rawtenstall in the upper reaches (13.5 km <lb/>from <lb/>source) to Strangeways adjacent to Manchester <lb/>city centre (56.5 km from source) and two <lb/>additional sites on the River Roch and Eagley <lb/>Brook tributaries were selected to cover a range <lb/>of putative clean and polluted waters and of <lb/>semi-rural to urban locations across the Irwell <lb/>catchment. Sites were sampled monthly in <lb/>September, October and November 2011 to <lb/>establish baseline Riverfly Partnership ARMI <lb/>scores. For comparison of the ARMI index with <lb/>BMWP and ASPT indices, 8 of the Riverfly <lb/>Partnership reference sites and one additional site <lb/>between Springwater Park and Burrs Country Park <lb/>were sampled in January and March 2012. <lb/>Sampling continued for nearly 4 years on the River <lb/>Roch and continues to the present (6 years of <lb/>data) at Ewood Bridge on the River Irwell and at <lb/>the Eagley Brook tributary. Additional sites were <lb/>sampled in April 2017 between the Chatterton <lb/>Country Park and Ewood Bridge reference sites in <lb/>response to a suspected pollution event to <lb/>constrain the upriver location at which the <lb/>macroinvertebrate kill began. <lb/>2.3 Mapping and data analysis <lb/>Maps were generated and distances along the <lb/>river measured using ArcMap and QGIS software. <lb/>Statistical analysis and graphs were produced <lb/>using Minitab and Microsoft Excel software. <lb/>Correlations of ARMI scores with BMWP or ASPT <lb/>scores were tested using Spearman&apos;s correlation <lb/>coefficient. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. RESULTS <lb/>3.1 Sites, baseline scores and long-term records <lb/>For 11 sites along the River Irwell and two <lb/>additional sites on the Eagley Brook and River <lb/>Roch tributaries (Fig. 1) an autumn (September to <lb/>November) baseline of ARMI scores was <lb/>established (Fig. 2). The ARMI baseline of 5.7 at <lb/>Rawtenstall (13.4 km from the source) increases <lb/>to 9.7 at Springwater Park 22.2 km downriver; <lb/>then decreases to 5.3 at Sion Street 3.9 km below <lb/>Springwater Park. The baseline falls as the Irwell <lb/>flows through the urban conurbation towards the <lb/>city center, with low scores of 2.7, 2.0 and 2.0 at <lb/>Clifton Country Park, Agecroft and Strangeways, <lb/>respectively (14.4 km, 8.7 km and 0.6 km from the <lb/>edge of the city center, respectively). Autumn <lb/>baseline ARMI scores for sites on Irwell tributaries <lb/>were 7.7 for Eagley Brook and 6.5 for the River <lb/>Roch (8.7 and 12.0 km from the boundary of the <lb/>city center, respectively). <lb/>Near continuous long-term monthly ARMI records <lb/>were compiled from September 2011 for 3 sites <lb/>(Fig. 3): Ewood Bridge on the upper River Irwell <lb/>(September 2011 to August 2017; mean 4.41, SD <lb/>1.43, range 2-8, n=61); Eagley Brook (August 2011 <lb/>to August 2017; mean 6.98, SD 1.92, range 4-13, <lb/>n=58); and the River Roch (November 2011 to <lb/>May 2015; mean 8.03, SD 2.07, range 3-12, n=37). <lb/>All three sites show no long-term inter-annual <lb/>trend. Examining combined annual data for <lb/>individual months January to December (Fig. 4) <lb/>showed significant seasonal influence on the ARMI <lb/>score (P&lt;0.01) using one-way ANOVA. <lb/>The validity of using autumn 2011 ARMI scores as <lb/>a baseline for the pollution event investigated in <lb/>April 2017 was therefore tested by comparing <lb/>multi-year April scores with autumn (September <lb/>to November scores) for the three long-term <lb/>monitoring sites. Paired t-tests showed no <lb/>statistical difference for Ewood Bridge (April mean <lb/>4.17, SD 0.75, range 3-5, n=6; autumn mean 4.22, <lb/>SD 1.31, range 3-7, n=18; n.s.), Eagley Brook (April <lb/>mean 5.75, SD 2.06, range 4-8, n=4; autumn mean <lb/>6.81, SD 1.22, range 4-9, n=16; n.s.) or the River <lb/>Roch (April mean 9.00, SD 0.82, range 8-10, n=4; <lb/>autumn mean 7.38, SD 2.50, range 3-12, n=8; n.s.). <lb/>Fig. 1 Riverfly Partnership reference sites on the <lb/>River Irwell and tributaries <lb/>Fig. 2 Baseline ARMI scores for 13 sites on the <lb/>River Irwell and tributaries from autumn 2011 <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2 Comparison with BMWP and ASPT indices <lb/>To compare ARMI, BMWP and ASPT indices, kick <lb/>samples were taken from 9 sites along the River <lb/>Irwell between Rawtenstall in the upper <lb/>catchment and near Manchester city centre at <lb/>Strangeways (13.5 km to 56.5 km from the source) <lb/>in January 2012 and then again in March 2012. All <lb/>macroinvertebrates in each sample were <lb/>identified and counted and then each individual <lb/>sample was scored for ARMI, BMWP and ASPT <lb/>indices. Significant (P&lt;0.01, n=18) moderate <lb/>positive correlations with ARMI for both BMWP <lb/>(r 2 =0.653) and ASPT (r 2 =0.653) were assigned <lb/>using the Spearman correlation coefficient (Fig. 5). <lb/>Fig. 5 Scatterplot of Riverfly ARMI scores with (a) <lb/>BMWP and (b) ASPT scores for the same series of <lb/>samples, taken from 9 sites on the River Irwell in <lb/>January 2012 and again in March 2012 <lb/>3.3 Macroinvertebrate loss in April 2017 <lb/>In April 2017 an angler fishing on the River Irwell <lb/>upriver of Manchester noted large numbers of <lb/>dead crayfish, suggesting a pollution incident, and <lb/>contact was made with the SFAS citizen science <lb/>monitors. A kick sample was carried out to <lb/>investigate the macroinvertebrate community at <lb/>the nearest reference site at Burrs Country Park <lb/>(see Fig. 1) and no macroinvertebrates were found <lb/>in the sample. <lb/>Volunteers carried out further kick samples at <lb/>existing reference sites upriver to Ewood Bridge, <lb/>where a healthy macroinvertebrate population <lb/>was found, and downriver to Agecroft (see Fig. 1) <lb/>to localize the source of pollution and how far the <lb/>macroinvertebrate kill extended (see Fig. 6). No <lb/>macroinvertebrates were found in samples taken <lb/>at Nuttall Park or Chatterton 6.2 km and 10.0 km <lb/>upriver of Burrs Country Park respectively but at <lb/>Ewood Bridge 14.8 km upriver a healthy <lb/>macroinvertebrate population was found with an <lb/>ARMI score of 4 typical for the site (long-term <lb/>mean 4.41, SD 1.43, range 2-8, n=61). <lb/>Macroinvertebrates were absent at the first <lb/>reference site downriver of Burrs Country Park <lb/>(Warth Fold, 4.4 km along the river). A limited <lb/>population of macroinvertebrates was found at <lb/>Springwater Park 7.4 km downriver of Burrs <lb/>Country Park and 330 m below the confluence of <lb/>the River Roch; but with an ARMI score of 1 <lb/>significantly below the baseline of 10 (range 7-13, <lb/>n=3) recorded from autumn 2011 (P&lt;0.01). <lb/>Continuing downriver, the third available <lb/>reference site at Agecroft had an ARMI score of 2, <lb/>which is comparable to the low baseline score <lb/>established for this site in autumn 2011 (mean 2, <lb/>range 1-3, n=3). <lb/>3.4 Citizen science identification of the putative <lb/>pollution site with reactive sampling <lb/>Volunteers carried out a responsive survey at <lb/>short distance interval additional sites downriver <lb/>of the healthy macroinvertebrate population at <lb/>Ewood Bridge on the River Irwell, a section which <lb/>includes a discharge point from a wastewater <lb/>treatment works, and on the River Ogden <lb/>tributary (see Table 1 and Fig. 7). <lb/></body>

			<body>with the River Irwell had healthy abundances of <lb/>various macroinvertebrate groups (ARMI score 9). <lb/>The location of the start of the macroinvertebrate <lb/>kill was therefore constrained to an approximately <lb/>30 m stretch of the River Irwell alongside the <lb/>discharge point of the wastewater treatment. The <lb/>Environment Agency was immediately contacted <lb/>with the information to request an investigation. <lb/>4. DISCUSSION <lb/>4.1 Pollution vigilance: responsiveness of the <lb/>citizen science network <lb/>There will usually be at least one sample taken on <lb/>the Irwell catchment in any one week as part of <lb/>the Riverfly Partnership citizen science Anglers&apos; <lb/>Riverfly Monitoring Initiative. Two long-term <lb/>reference sites (Ewood Bridge on the River Irwell <lb/>and the Eagley Brook tributary) continue to be <lb/>monitored on a monthly basis, whilst additional <lb/>volunteers carry out occasional sampling at <lb/>different ad hoc locations to assess <lb/>macroinvertebrate populations alongside <lb/>recreational fishing. Regular monitoring and the <lb/>presence of anglers ready to take reactive samples <lb/>if pollution is suspected means large-scale <lb/>macroinvertebrate kills have a high likelihood of <lb/>detection. Further investigations by the citizen <lb/>science group can then be instigated and, if <lb/>appropriate, be reported to the Environment <lb/>Agency along with clear data on impacts, as <lb/>happened in April 2017. Existing reference sites <lb/>with known baselines allowed volunteers to <lb/>quickly identify that the April 2017 pollution event <lb/>had occurred between the Chatterton and Ewood <lb/>Bridge reference sites. Reactive identification of <lb/>additional sampling sites was able to constrain a <lb/>short stretch of river along which the pollution <lb/>impact began. Reference sites downriver indicated <lb/>that macroinvertebrate life was absent until the <lb/>confluence of the River Roch (macroinvertebrates <lb/>present at Springwater Park 330 m downriver of <lb/>the confluence, albeit with an ARMI score of 2 <lb/>significantly below the baseline of 10; P&lt;0.01). <lb/>This evidence of a substantial pollution event <lb/>destroying the macroinvertebrate community <lb/>along an estimated 19 km stretch of the River <lb/>Irwell was then passed to the Environment Agency <lb/>requesting an investigatory response. Without the <lb/>citizen science network provided by the Riverfly <lb/>Partnership this large-scale macroinvertebrate kill <lb/>would almost certainly have gone undetected by <lb/>the Environment Agency because it did not result <lb/>in evident fish death, which is the usual indicator <lb/>of a pollution event noticed by the general public. <lb/>No formal outcome of investigation by the <lb/>Environment Agency is currently available but the <lb/>most likely explanation is that a large quantity of <lb/>pesticide made its way into the River Irwell <lb/>alongside the wastewater treatment works <lb/>discharge. This incident has similarities to the <lb/>chlorpyrifos pesticide pollution events examined <lb/>by Raven &amp; George (1989) for the River Roding <lb/>and by Thompson et al. (2016) for the River <lb/>Kennet, both tributaries of the River Thames in <lb/>southern England and the latter case similarly <lb/>identified by citizen scientists following a <lb/>large-scale macroinvertebrate kill. The Chatterton, <lb/>Nuttall Park and Burrs Country Park sites with zero <lb/>macroinvertebrates in April 2017 were monitored <lb/>for recovery on a monthly basis after the pollution <lb/>event on the River Irwell. No macroinvertebrates <lb/>were found in May but olives (Baetidae) were <lb/>found in small numbers in June and July (10 or <lb/>less, ARMI score 1-2), increasing to 100 or more <lb/>olives in September samples (ARMI score 3). No <lb/>other ARMI macroinvertebrate groups were <lb/>present as of the latest samples in September <lb/>2017. <lb/>4.2 Broad awareness but limited records <lb/>Whilst the ad hoc basis of much of the sampling <lb/>does suffice to provide a broad awareness of <lb/>pollution of the rivers of the Irwell catchment and <lb/>to raise alerts to specific pollution events, it has <lb/>proven difficult to translate into a resilient <lb/>long-term monitoring program. The SFAS was only <lb/>able to engage citizen science volunteers to <lb/>continue monitoring for 5 of the initial 13 sites <lb/>used in the autumn 2011 baseline survey. Of these <lb/>5, monitoring ended at Rawtenstall after 20 <lb/>months (data last collected April 2013) and at <lb/>Clifton Country Park after 23 months (data last <lb/>collected June 2013). Monitoring continued on the <lb/>3 remaining sites, giving long-term records, and <lb/></body>

			<body>continues as of September 2017 for both Ewood <lb/>Bridge on the upper River Irwell and on the Eagley <lb/>Brook tributary (monitoring ended on the River <lb/>Roch in May 2015). Despite additional training <lb/>events in 2015, 2016 and 2017 certifying further <lb/>volunteers as monitors, the informal and devolved <lb/>organization of SFAS citizen science activity has <lb/>hampered efforts to restart long-term monitoring <lb/>at other reference sites. Two of the 2016 trainees <lb/>do regularly conduct Riverfly Partnership <lb/>assessments of ad hoc sites alongside recreational <lb/>fishing, as do other interested anglers, but it has <lb/>proven difficult to capture this data and the <lb/>volunteer group&apos;s central database is far from <lb/>comprehensive. The Riverfly Partnership does <lb/>have an online portal for record submission but <lb/>this only allows data entry for monitoring sites <lb/>formally agreed with the Environment Agency, <lb/>meaning there is no flexibility for additional data <lb/>capture. Approaches to sustaining volunteer <lb/>engagement should be reappraised considering <lb/>the importance of maintaining links between the <lb/>data collectors, the accumulating data, and the <lb/>monitoring outcomes as stressed by Roy et al. <lb/>(2012) and Pocock et al. (2014). One possibility to <lb/>establish durable monitoring sites might be to <lb/>engage a coordinated network of existing local <lb/>environmental volunteer groups active along <lb/>rivers, for example associated with parks, <lb/>woodlands and other green spaces. <lb/>4.3 Approaches for an effective citizen science <lb/>monitoring network across Greater Manchester <lb/>A major pollution event such as occurred in April <lb/>2017 needs to be detected with minimal delay so <lb/>that action can be taken to remedy the source and <lb/>for the statutory authorities to obtain further <lb/>investigatory evidence. Realistically, monitoring <lb/>activity once a week is the maximum temporal <lb/>resolution for even the most vigorous volunteer <lb/>group. Yet any one specific site cannot be sampled <lb/>at greater than monthly frequency because of the <lb/>need to allow recolonization and normalization of <lb/>the habitats in between sampling events. In <lb/>addition, a point source pollution event will only <lb/>be detected if a sample is taken from a site <lb/>downriver. An effective monitoring network <lb/>therefore depends on appropriate coverage <lb/>across the Irwell catchment and a coordinated <lb/>roster of sites for weekly samples. This would <lb/>offer the opportunity to coordinate the three <lb/>goals competing for the finite time of citizen <lb/>science monitors: frequent monitoring able to <lb/>detect major pollution events with minimum <lb/>delay; breadth of coverage; and specific sites with <lb/>long-term records. This coverage and frequency is <lb/>only possible with volunteers (Latimore &amp; Steen <lb/>2014; Kobori et al. 2016) but also depends on <lb/>individual monitors being effectively supported, <lb/>which has proven a time and resource challenge <lb/>within the volunteer-managed SFAS citizen <lb/>science program. <lb/>4.4 Deciding pollution alert trigger levels in urban <lb/>river catchments with low and variable <lb/>macroinvertebrate diversity <lb/>Unless a pollution event causing large-scale <lb/>macroinvertebrate death also results in a major <lb/>fish kill it is likely to be unseen, unreported and <lb/>hence not investigated without ARMI activity. The <lb/>ARMI methodology was designed specifically to <lb/>enable trained citizen scientists to detect severe <lb/>changes in water quality such as this. However, a <lb/>challenge has been in justifying an investigatory <lb/>response by the Environment Agency to low ARMI <lb/>scores, particularly when these are only localized <lb/>drops in macroinvertebrate abundance. Based on <lb/>6 years data, for example, Ewood Bridge has a <lb/>mean ARMI score of 4.41 (SD 1.43, range 2-8) so <lb/>an ARMI score of 1 is the realistic trigger level and <lb/>an investigation by the Environment Agency <lb/>would only be triggered in response to a major <lb/>macroinvertebrate kill. The importance of a <lb/>baseline for specific sites is highlighted by the <lb/>baseline drop, for example, between Springwater <lb/>Park (ARMI score 10) and Agecroft (ARMI score 2) <lb/>16.5 km downriver. The April 2017 ARMI score of <lb/>2 for Springwater Park indicates an impacted <lb/>macroinvertebrate community, whereas the ARMI <lb/>score of 2 for Agecroft is consistent with the <lb/>baseline for this site closer to Manchester city <lb/>centre. Whether that means the pollution impact <lb/>of the April 2017 event was negligible at Agecroft <lb/>we are unable to judge, given the lack of <lb/>sensitivity of such a low baseline and already <lb/>markedly degraded community. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.5 The Anglers&apos; Riverfly Monitoring Initiative as <lb/>a practical and effective citizen science method <lb/>For use in citizen science, a sampling method must <lb/>be easy to use and require minimal equipment <lb/>and training. Kick sampling, the semi-quantitative <lb/>approach of both Riverfly Partnership citizen <lb/>science and UK statutory monitoring, is favored <lb/>for statutory biomonitoring globally over <lb/>complete and quantitative sampling methods such <lb/>as Surber sampling because it is quick and easy to <lb/>carry out (Everall et al. 2017). Field sorting <lb/>becomes practical when using live samples and <lb/>identification to broad taxonomic groups without <lb/>optical aids (Haase et al. 2004; Growns et al. <lb/>2016). The Riverfly Partnership ARMI satisfies <lb/>these requirements through simple bankside <lb/>identification of live samples with broad groups of <lb/>readily identifiable taxa and minimal equipment <lb/>requirements. Groups are identified according to <lb/>presence and number of tails and pairs of legs, <lb/>appearance of the gills, and (for cased caddisfly <lb/>larvae) presence of a case. Live samples make <lb/>identification easier through behavioral <lb/>characteristics -the only two groups that look <lb/>superficially similar as dead specimens are readily <lb/>distinguished in a live sample by their very <lb/>different swimming motions (i.e. the short <lb/>forward dashes of olives Baetidae versus the <lb/>convulsive thrashing of blue-winged olive <lb/>Ephemerellidae). Experienced monitors can score <lb/>a kick sample spread out in a small tray by eye for <lb/>the ARMI index without any sorting needed. Even <lb/>for beginners, scoring for abundance is <lb/>straightforward after separating the 8 target <lb/>groups by live sorting into a compartmentalized <lb/>tray (although this is relatively time consuming). <lb/>Exact counts are difficult with moving live <lb/>individuals but estimates of numbers suffice for <lb/>the Riverfly Partnership ARMI abundance <lb/>categories. Broad taxonomic groups are <lb/>recognized as making little difference to biotic <lb/>indices scoring compared to species-level <lb/>identification and accepted as the only option for <lb/>citizen science monitoring where taxonomic <lb/>expertise, time, and equipment are limited <lb/>(Hilsenhoff 1988; Lenat &amp; Resh 2001; Jones 2008). <lb/>The rapid response and immediate results <lb/>obtained at the time of sampling is a key <lb/>advantage of the Riverfly Partnership ARMI index <lb/>over the BMWP and ASPT indices. The potential <lb/>for geographic coverage and temporal resolution <lb/>that the ARMI index gives would be unattainable <lb/>using more discriminatory scoring methods such <lb/>as BMWP or ASPT, a major advantage of citizen <lb/>science approaches (Kobori et al. 2016; Shupe <lb/>2016). Comparison here of ARMI scores with <lb/>BMWP and ASPT scores for the same samples <lb/>found statistically highly significant (P&lt;0.01) <lb/>correlations, validating the ARMI as an equivalent <lb/>indicator of water quality status for the rivers of <lb/>the Irwell catchment. A larger data set, however, <lb/>would be needed to derive quantitative <lb/>relationships that could be applied more widely -<lb/>this should cover the full range of ARMI scores, <lb/>seasons and site types including substrate and <lb/>flow regime (the latter influenced by canalization <lb/>in urbanized rivers such as the Irwell). One <lb/>important aspect of the ARMI is that it assesses a <lb/>selection of taxa found in clean to moderately <lb/>polluted water only, rather than all <lb/>macroinvertebrates including those that can live <lb/>in highly polluted water as with the BMWP and <lb/>ASPT indices. The ARMI therefore would not be <lb/>sensitive to differences between highly and <lb/>severely polluted water as scores would simply be <lb/>zero -whilst BMWP and ASPT indices retain <lb/>sensitivity within more polluted water. It is also <lb/>interesting to note that, despite anecdotal reports <lb/>from anglers of less macroinvertebrate life seen <lb/>when fishing, the extensive winter floods of <lb/>2015-16 across northern Britain (Marsh et al. <lb/>2016) had no discernible impact on ARMI scores in <lb/>the monitoring records for the two Irwell <lb/>catchment sites which cover this period (Ewood <lb/>Bridge and Eagley Brook). This could be because <lb/>broad identification groups miss subtler changes <lb/>(Lenat &amp; Resh 2001). It certainly highlights that <lb/>the variability of ARMI scores means only severe <lb/>pollution impacts on macroinvertebrate life are <lb/>identifiable in the Irwell catchment. The ARMI <lb/>index was of course explicitly designed to detect <lb/>acute pollution incidents but this highlights that <lb/>more detailed monitoring and investigation work <lb/>would be required to identify subtler chronic <lb/>pollution and to assess its impacts. In relation to <lb/></body>

			<body>these observations, pilot studies are ongoing <lb/>within the Riverfly Partnership for &quot;Riverfly Plus&quot; <lb/>indices of greater complexity that would provide <lb/>citizen scientists with a monitoring platform <lb/>sensitive to specific water quality stressors <lb/>beyond the scope of the existing ARMI index. <lb/>4.6 Citizen science as a catalyst for public <lb/>engagement and change <lb/>The involvement of volunteers and local <lb/>communities allows monitoring to transcend the <lb/>limitations of research and monitoring by <lb/>academics or regulatory bodies and provides <lb/>scope for implementation of community-led <lb/>environmental improvement projects (Kobori et <lb/>al. 2016). This is very much the case with the <lb/>Riverfly Partnership citizen science program in <lb/>Greater Manchester. The Riverfly Partnership <lb/>group at the SFAS galvanized interest from anglers <lb/>in wider environmental action. This led to further <lb/>projects and funding from various sources for <lb/>tackling invasive non-native species such as Giant <lb/>Hogweed, Himalayan Balsam and Japanese <lb/>Knotweed along the Irwell and tributaries. The <lb/>SFAS also became involved in community clean up <lb/>events along the riverside in public green spaces <lb/>and in schools outreach engaging children with <lb/>their local rivers. This community engagement led <lb/>to media interest, which raised the profile of <lb/>events and encouraged more people to get <lb/>involved. As was typical for friendly societies <lb/>(Cordery 1995), the SFAS has held its regular <lb/>meetings in public houses for 200 years and this <lb/>history led to the group and the citizen science <lb/>work being featured on the British Broadcasting <lb/>Corporation (BBC) television series &quot;Pubs That <lb/>Built Britain&quot; in April 2015. The BBC&apos;s Countryfile <lb/>magazine has also featured the SFAS&apos; citizen <lb/>science, wider environmental work and schools <lb/>outreach (Griffiths 2016). As has been observed <lb/>elsewhere (Nerbonne &amp; Nelson 2008), conflicts of <lb/>volunteer goals, however, were quickly apparent <lb/>with some anglers not wanting the group to move <lb/>in an environmental direction and non-anglers <lb/>wanting to get involved but being discouraged by <lb/>the SFAS being an &quot;anglers&apos; society&quot;. The <lb/>divergence of goals and interest outside the SFAS <lb/>led to the establishment in 2015 of the Mersey <lb/>Basin Rivers Trust as a free membership umbrella <lb/>organization that would be the face of the wider <lb/>environmental work. <lb/>4.7 Bridging the gap between top-down <lb/>initiatives and communities <lb/>Being part of the wider River Mersey catchment, <lb/>the Irwell catchment benefited substantially from <lb/>the Mersey Basin Campaign between 1985 and its <lb/>termination in 2010. This was a ground-breaking <lb/>model of partnership approach linking water <lb/>quality improvements with wider river corridor <lb/>sustainability and urban regeneration (Struthers <lb/>1997; Wood et al. 1999). Government-led but <lb/>with substantial private investment, such <lb/>partnerships included the regeneration of <lb/>Manchester Docks on the River Irwell (where it <lb/>becomes canalized as the Manchester Ship Canal) <lb/>and its transformation into the Salford Quays <lb/>development (Williams et al. 2010). The Healthy <lb/>Waterways Trust was the Mersey Basin Campaign <lb/>vehicle for administering charitable funds and <lb/>continued post-2010 as the focus for continuing <lb/>government-led input and resources for engaging <lb/>people with the River Irwell and the wider Mersey <lb/>Basin, later rebranding as the Healthy Rivers Trust. <lb/>Yet there remained a need for more effective <lb/>community engagement, with criticism of the <lb/>top-down approach for genuinely engaging <lb/>communities (Eden &amp; Tunstall 2006). The <lb/>expansion of SFAS and Riverfly Partnership citizen <lb/>science into wider environmental work and the <lb/>foundation in 2015 of the Mersey Basin Rivers <lb/>Trust went someway to filling this gap. The <lb/>Mersey Basin Rivers Trust has now merged with <lb/>the Healthy Rivers Trust, bridging the gap <lb/>between top-down and bottom-up approaches. <lb/>The new entity, the Mersey Rivers Trust, has taken <lb/>the lead role in both the Upper Mersey (covering <lb/>the Irwell and tributaries) and Lower Mersey <lb/>catchment partnerships under the UK <lb/>government&apos;s catchment-based approach (CaBA) <lb/>framework for EU Water Framework Directive <lb/>compliant river basin management plans (Cascade <lb/>Consulting, 2013; Robins et al. 2017). <lb/>5.

			<body>riverbanks across the United Kingdom identifying <lb/>pollution incidents that would otherwise likely go <lb/>unseen and unreported. Anglers trained as citizen <lb/>scientists provide day-to-day coverage from the <lb/>riverbanks whilst fishing that cannot be matched <lb/>for awareness by cost-and labor-intensive <lb/>professional assessments of water quality. Riverfly <lb/>Partnership citizen science in Manchester has <lb/>catalyzed broader environmental engagement, <lb/>further funding, and led to the bridging of a divide <lb/>between top-down government-led approaches <lb/>and genuine grassroots environmental action. The <lb/>ability of citizen science networks such as this to <lb/>provide pollution vigilance across a river <lb/>catchment was demonstrated in April 2017 by <lb/>detecting a major pollution event and rapidly <lb/>constraining the location of the pollution source. <lb/>Challenges remain in terms of coordination, <lb/>centralized record-keeping and reconciling <lb/>different goals with limited resources but this case <lb/>study shows the potential of citizen science to <lb/>play an important role in the protection and <lb/>improvement of river catchments. <lb/></body>
