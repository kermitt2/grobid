			<body>One of the significant social changes seen in the past <lb/>few decades is the decision taken by an increasing number <lb/>of women, particularly career women, to delay starting a <lb/>family. These decisions often invite undesirable con-<lb/>sequences such as difficulties in conception, and a major <lb/>contributing factor to such difficulties is ovarian aging 1 . A <lb/>primary cause of ovarian aging is depletion of the ovarian <lb/>pool of nongrowing follicles (NGFs) 2 . While this process <lb/>is a natural consequence of aging, its onset also varies <lb/>significantly among individuals as indicated by large range <lb/>in age at which women undergo menopause. It is also <lb/>becoming increasingly clear that other factors besides <lb/>normal hormonal cycles influence ovarian aging. In par-<lb/>ticular, we are now coming to appreciate that large vari-<lb/>abilities in diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) between <lb/>individuals reflect both genetic and environmental factors <lb/>and, above all, their complex interplay. <lb/>Genome-wide association studies have identified at least <lb/>44 genomic loci that influence the age of menopause <lb/>onset 3 . Furthermore, environmental factors (e.g., diet and <lb/>chemical toxins) also modulate the rate of decline in <lb/>ovarian reserve (OR). Overall, they can impact processes <lb/>such as oxidative stress, inflammation and hormone <lb/>secretion, all contributing to follicular atrophy 4 . Thus, the <lb/>onset of ovarian aging is recognized as an exceedingly <lb/>complex process in which age, genetics and environment <lb/>participate, although the precise mechanisms by which <lb/>these may do so are poorly understood. <lb/>Where do we stand from the perspective of clinical <lb/>diagnosis of progression of ovarian aging or predisposition <lb/>to ovarian aging? Unfortunately, there are no genetic or <lb/>exposure markers for assessing OR available for routine <lb/>clinical use. Current methods for measuring OR and <lb/>predicting onset of fertility loss and menopause involve <lb/>measurements of serum levels of follicle-stimulating hor-<lb/>mone, inhibin B, anti-Müllerian hormone, and antral fol-<lb/>licle counts. However, none of these parameters accurately <lb/>estimate the reproductive lifespan of an individual 5 . Thus, <lb/>new strategies for assessing OR progression, or predis-<lb/>position are needed. One promising approach to this end <lb/>is to use gene-environment interaction studies to identify <lb/>sensitive and specific biomarkers for evaluating the <lb/>&quot;biological ovarian age&quot;. That is, a reliable measure of <lb/>ovarian health that does not factor chronological age since <lb/>ovarian health and chronological age are rather loosely <lb/>coupled 6 . A productive execution of such an approach <lb/>requires a detailed understanding of the molecular <lb/>mechanisms that operate during the ovarian aging process. <lb/>New diagnostic tools could be rationally designed focusing <lb/>on the identification of molecules impaired by all the <lb/>factors influencing ovarian aging. <lb/>Such as approach has been undertaken by Cuomo et al. 7 <lb/>in their paper recently published in Cell Death Discovery. <lb/>They applied a differential transcriptomics approach in a <lb/>mouse model system to identify novel candidate bio-<lb/>markers for reliably estimating ovary lifespan as a function <lb/>of age, genetic background and exposure to environ-<lb/>mental stressors (e.g., diets and endocrine disruptors). <lb/>The cohort of differentially expressed genes in ovaries <lb/>from young (3-month-old) as compared to middle-aged <lb/>(12-month-old) mice highlighted pathways previously <lb/>shown to be involved in ovarian aging (e.g., EIF2 <lb/>and mTOR signaling, mitochondrial stress pathways <lb/>TGF-beta signaling), as well as protein translation systems <lb/>which had not been previously associated with ovarian <lb/></body>

			<body>aging (e.g., ribosomal proteins, Rps3, Rps24; regulatory <lb/>Eif3a, Eif3m, Eif4g2; small nucleolar RNAs, <lb/>Snord16a, Snora34). <lb/>The most interesting aspect of the Cuomo et al. study 7 <lb/>was the unexpected identification of differentially <lb/>expressed non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in this tran-<lb/>scriptomics study. Specifically, the relevant ncRNAs <lb/>included miRNAs (Mir143, Mir145, Mir505, Mir681, and <lb/>Mir692-1), small nucleolar RNAs (Snord16a and Snora34) <lb/>and a long non-coding RNA (Gas5). Particular attention <lb/>was focused on Mir143 and Mir145. Indeed, the work of <lb/>Cuomo et al. represents the first evidence of the asso-<lb/>ciation of this microRNA pair with ovarian aging and <lb/>DOR. The case for these miRNAs as the basis for a <lb/>diagnostic strategy is reinforced by the demonstration that <lb/>Mir143 and Mir145 expression was consistently deranged <lb/>by all factors that promote ovarian aging-i.e., age, genetic <lb/>background, and environmental factors. Moreover, the <lb/>bioinformatic analyses of the transcripts targeted by both <lb/>Mir143 and Mir145 implicate these miRNAs in regulation <lb/>of cellular pathways whose compromise is linked to <lb/>ovarian aging. Specifically, Mir143 and Mir145 do have <lb/>different targets which enrich for signaling <lb/>pathways: PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and AMPK. This sug-<lb/>gests that miRNAs might act on the same cellular path-<lb/>ways but at different levels and most definitely through <lb/>different mechanisms. An example is the PI3K/AKT <lb/>pathway, whose components are known to be required <lb/>for: (i) follicles development 8 and (ii) telomere protection 9 <lb/>(Fig. 1). Noteworthy, the authors report Mir681 up reg-<lb/>ulation in the ovaries from middle-aged mice which is <lb/>known to functionally suppress AKT 10 . While it remains <lb/>unclear exactly how these pathways modulate physiolo-<lb/>gical and induced ovarian aging processes, these data <lb/>nevertheless offer a new path for establishing a <lb/>mechanistic-based diagnostic marker linking age, genetic, <lb/>and environmental factors in the ovarian aging process. <lb/>The fact that Mir143 and Mir145 abundance can be fol-<lb/>lowed in follicular fluid (FF) from women is yet another <lb/>advantage for their development as suitable biomarkers. <lb/>How faithfully mouse studies translate to the human <lb/>condition is always a concern. In that regard, there is no <lb/>question that much work needs to be done to validate the <lb/>efficacy of these ncRNA biomarkers in estimating human <lb/>ovarian aging. But, the early returns are promising. <lb/>Cuomo and colleagues 7 present preliminary results <lb/>showing that FF from women with DOR exhibit elevated <lb/>Mir143, Mir145 levels. Although those analytical data <lb/>were derived from a small sample size, the results none-<lb/>theless remain consistent with Mir143 and Mir145 <lb/>expression being associated with reductions in mature <lb/>oocyte loads and compromised oocyte reprogramming <lb/>capacities (an indicator of MII oocyte quality). The pro-<lb/>filing of Mir143, Mir145, and other ncRNAs in FF samples <lb/>now offers a promising translational strategy for devel-<lb/>oping an effective and predictive biomarker platform to <lb/>monitor ovarian aging in the general human population <lb/>using noninvasive methods. <lb/></body>
