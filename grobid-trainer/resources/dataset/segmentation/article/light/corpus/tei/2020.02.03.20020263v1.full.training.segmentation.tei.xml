			<front>Abstract <lb/>Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome <lb/>coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), <lb/>and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and <lb/>mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug <lb/>repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, <lb/>could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this <lb/>study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing <lb/>a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay <lb/>between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein <lb/>interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that <lb/>2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) <lb/>among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and <lb/>nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having <lb/>the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. <lb/>Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in <lb/>the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative <lb/>repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we <lb/>prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, <lb/>mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of <lb/>drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. <lb/>Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus <lb/>dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including <lb/>humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [1] . In the past 2 decades, <lb/>two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory <lb/>syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus <lb/>(MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high <lb/>morbidity and mortality [2] . For example, 8,098 individuals were infected and 774 died in <lb/>the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to <lb/>$100 billion [3, 4] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November <lb/>2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2,494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the <lb/>majority in Saudi Arabia [2] . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 <lb/>novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was found in Wuhan, China. As of February 02, 2020, <lb/>there have been over 14,000 cases with ~300 deaths for the 2019-nCoV pandemic <lb/>(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html); furthermore, human-to-human <lb/>transmission has occurred among close contacts [5] . However, there are currently no <lb/>effective medications against 2019-nCoV. Several national and international research <lb/></body>

			<body>groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-<lb/>nCoV, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the <lb/>development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV outbreak. <lb/>Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and <lb/>development has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual number <lb/>of new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has <lb/>remained relatively constant and limited [6] . A recent study estimated that pharmaceutical <lb/>companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the development <lb/>of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug [7] . Drug repurposing, represented as an <lb/>effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time <lb/>and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical <lb/>trials [8-10] . However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and time-<lb/>consuming. [11] Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for <lb/>systematic drug repositioning [8-10, 12, 13] . However, traditional structure-based methods <lb/>are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, <lb/>unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, <lb/>targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapid <lb/>evolution of virus genomes [1] . <lb/>Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replication <lb/>during infections [1] . Systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions <lb/>(PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidation of the mechanisms of viral infection [14, <lb/> 15] <lb/>. Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus-host interactome, <lb/>may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viral <lb/></body>

			<body>infections [1] , including SARS-CoV [16] , MERS-CoV [16] , Ebola virus [17] , and Zika virus [13, 18-<lb/>20] <lb/>. We recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that <lb/>incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, known functional drug-gene network, <lb/>and bioinformatics analyses [13] . This methodology allows to identify several candidate <lb/>repurposable drugs for Ebola virus [10, 13] . Our work over the last decade has <lb/>demonstrated how network strategies can, for example, be used to identify effective <lb/>repurposable drugs [12, 21-24] and drug combinations [25] for multiple human diseases. For <lb/>example, network-based drug-disease proximity that sheds light on the relationship <lb/>between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in <lb/>disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for <lb/>efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug <lb/>combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies [12, 22, 25] . <lb/>In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology <lb/>that combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that <lb/>quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the <lb/>human PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) the <lb/>proteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized in <lb/>the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network [26] ; and (ii) <lb/>proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug <lb/>targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common PPIs and functional pathways <lb/>elucidated by the human interactome (Figure 1).

			<body>transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action in a <lb/>specific HCoV for which we propose repurposing (Figure 1). <lb/>Results <lb/>Phylogenetic Analyses of 2019-nCoV <lb/>To date, 7 pathogenic HCoVs (Figure 2A and 2B) have been found [1, 27] : (i) 2019-nCoV, <lb/>SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are b genera, and (ii) HCoV-<lb/>NL63 and HCoV-229E are a genera. We performed the phylogenetic analyses using the <lb/>whole genome sequence data from 15 HCoVs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of <lb/>2019-nCoV with other HCoVs. We found that the whole genomes of 2019-nCoV had <lb/>~99.99% nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients (Supplementary <lb/>Table S1). The 2019-nCoV shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.7%) <lb/>with SARS-CoV among the 6 other known pathogenic HCoVs, revealing conserved <lb/>evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (Figure 2A). <lb/>HCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viral <lb/>replications [27] , including replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), <lb/>membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Figure 2B). The ORF1ab gene encodes <lb/>the non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic <lb/>processing [28] . The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-<lb/>factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein three-<lb/>dimensional (3D) structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal <lb/>extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain (Figure 2C).

			<body>spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral <lb/>infection through binding the host receptor [29, 30] . Figure 2D shows the 3D structure of <lb/>the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) <lb/>in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV is able to utilize <lb/>ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells [31] , suggesting potential drug <lb/>targets for therapeutic development. In addition, the nucleocapsid is also an important <lb/>subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization [32] , and the <lb/>single nucleocapsid structure was shown in Figure 2E. <lb/>Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV was most <lb/>evolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, the <lb/>envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved <lb/>regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-<lb/>CoV (Supplementary Table S2). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowest <lb/>sequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV and SARS-<lb/>CoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV only has 31.9% sequence identity <lb/>compared to MERS-CoV. <lb/>HCoV-host Interactome Network <lb/>First, we assembled the CoV-associated host proteins from 4 known HCoVs (SARS-<lb/>CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), one mouse MHV, and one avian IBV <lb/>(N protein) (Supplementary Table S3).

			<body>proteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucial <lb/>pathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Figure <lb/>3A. We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, <lb/>with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway <lb/>enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value <lb/>&lt; 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus <lb/>infection, and influenza (Figure 3B). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment <lb/>analyses further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value &lt; <lb/>0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, <lb/>viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion <lb/>attachment to host cell (Figure 3C). We then mapped the known drug-target network <lb/>(see Methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets. <lb/>We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Figure 3A) can be targeted by at <lb/>least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trial. For example, GSK3B, <lb/>DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The high <lb/>druggability of HCoV-host interactome motivates us to develop a therapeutic strategy by <lb/>specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs, such as drug repurposing. <lb/>Network-based Drug Repurposing for HCoVs <lb/>The basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the <lb/>notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern a viral infection are <lb/>localized in the corresponding subnetwork (Figure 1A) within the comprehensive <lb/>human interactome network.

			<body>HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the <lb/>corresponding subnetwork in the human interactome (Figure 1), as we demonstrated in <lb/>multiple diseases [12, 21, 22, 25] using this drug repurposing strategy. We used a state-of-<lb/>the-art network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between HCoV-specific <lb/>subnetwork (Figure 3A) and drug targets in the human protein-protein interactome. We <lb/>constructed a drug-target network by assembling target information for more than 2,000 <lb/>FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Methods). To improve the quality and <lb/>completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five <lb/>types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs <lb/>from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays; (3) experimentally identified <lb/>kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; <lb/>and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidences (see Methods). We <lb/>used a Z-score (Z) measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network <lb/>proximity analyses (including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literature-<lb/>derived PPI data bias) as described in our recent studies [12, 25] . <lb/>In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z &lt; -1.5 <lb/>and P &lt; 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV-host interactome (Figure 4A and <lb/>Supplementary Table S4). To validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from 6 CoVs, <lb/>we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for 4 CoVs with a high <lb/>enough number of know host proteins, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and <lb/>MHV, separately. We found that the Z-scores showed consistency among the pooled <lb/>119 HCoV-associated proteins and other 4 individual CoVs (Figure 4B). The Pearson <lb/>correlation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled HCoV are 0.926 <lb/></body>

These network proximity analyses <lb/>offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. <lb/>Discovery of Repurposable Drugs for HCoV <lb/>To further validate the 135 repurposable drugs against HCoVs, we first performed gene <lb/>set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using transcriptome data of MERS-CoV and SARS-<lb/>CoV infected host cells (see Methods). These transcriptome data were used as gene <lb/>signatures for HCoVs. Additionally, we downloaded the expression data of drug-treated <lb/>human cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [33] to obtain drug-gene <lb/>signatures. We calculated a GSEA score (see Methods) for each drug and used this <lb/>score as an indication of bioinformatics validation of the 135 drugs. Specifically, an <lb/>enrichment score (ES) was calculated for each HCoV data set, and ES &gt; 0 and P &lt; 0.05 <lb/>(permutation test) was used as cut-off for a significant association of gene signatures <lb/>between a drug and a specific HCoV. The GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 3, is the <lb/>number of data sets that met these criteria for a specific drug. Mesalazine (an approved <lb/>drug for inflammatory bowel disease), sirolimus (an approved immunosuppressive <lb/>drug), and equilin (an approved agonist of the estrogen receptor for menopausal <lb/>symptoms) achieved the highest GSEA scores of 3, followed by paroxetine and <lb/>melatonin with GSEA scores of 2. We next selected 16 potential repurposable drugs <lb/>(Figure 5A and Table 1) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a <lb/>combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller <lb/>network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses; <lb/></body>

			<body>(iii) literature-reported antiviral evidences, and (iv) fewer clinically reported side effects. <lb/>Specifically, we showcased several selected repurposable drugs with literature-reported <lb/>antiviral evidences as below. <lb/>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). An overexpression of <lb/>estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication [34] . <lb/>SERMs have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through <lb/>the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor [34] . SERMs interfere at the <lb/>post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion, as the SERMs&apos; antiviral activity <lb/>still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression [17] . <lb/>Toremifene (Z = -3.23, Figure 5A), the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, exhibits <lb/>potential effects in blocking various viral infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, <lb/>and Ebola virus in established cell lines [16, 35] . Interestingly, different from the classical <lb/>ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and <lb/>endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane <lb/>glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication [36] . As shown in Figure 5B, <lb/>toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as <lb/>RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E [37, 38] . Equilin (Z = -2.52 and GSEA <lb/>score = 3), an estrogenic steroid produced by horses, also has been proven to have <lb/>moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of Zaire Ebola virus-glycoprotein and human <lb/>immunodeficiency virus (ZEBOV-GP/HIV) [17] . Altogether, network-predicted SERMs <lb/>(such as toremifene and equilin) offer potential repurposable candidates for HCoVs. <lb/>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs have been reported to associate <lb/>with viral infection, including HCoVs [39-41] . Irbesartan (Z = -5.98), a typical ARB, was <lb/></body>

			<body>approved by the FDA for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Here, <lb/>network proximity analysis shows a significant association between Irbesartan&apos;s targets <lb/>and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Figure 5C, <lb/>irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) <lb/>protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis <lb/>B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus <lb/>inhibiting viral entry [42, 43] . SLC10A1 interacts with C11orf74, a potential transcriptional <lb/>repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of SARS-CoV [44] . There are several other ARBs <lb/>(such as eletriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan) in which their targets are potentially <lb/>associated with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. <lb/>Immunosuppressant or antineoplastic agents. Previous studies have <lb/>confirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as the key factor <lb/>in regulating various viruses&apos; replications, including Andes orthohantavirus and <lb/>coronavirus [45, 46] . Sirolimus (Z = -2.35 and GSEA score = 3), an inhibitor of mammalian <lb/>target of rapamycin (mTOR), was reported to effectively block viral protein expression <lb/>and virion release effectively [47] . Indeed, the latest study revealed the clinical <lb/>application: sirolimus reduced MERS-CoV infection by over 60% [48] . Moreover, sirolimus <lb/>usage in managing patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure <lb/>can improve those patients&apos; prognosis significantly [47] . Mercaptopurine (Z = -2.44 and <lb/>GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been <lb/>used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several auto-<lb/>immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and <lb/>Crohn&apos;s disease [49] .

Mechanistically, <lb/>mercaptopurine potentially target several host proteins in HCoVs, such as JUN, <lb/>PABPC1, NPM1, and NCL [37, 52] (Figure 5D). <lb/>Anti-inflammatory agents. Inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral <lb/>infections [53, 54] . As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = -<lb/>1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a <lb/>potential strategy in the management of viral infections [55, 56] . Viral infections are often <lb/>associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress <lb/>increases significantly and leaves negative effects on multiple organ functions [57] . The <lb/>antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients&apos; <lb/>clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or <lb/>even curb the viral replication or transcription [58, 59] . In addition, the application of <lb/>melatonin may prolong patients&apos; survival time, which may provide a chance for patients&apos; <lb/>immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Figure 5E, <lb/>melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, <lb/>JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is <lb/>reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cell-<lb/>derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice <lb/>infected with encephalomyocarditis virus [60] . <lb/>In summary, our network proximity analyses offer multiple putative repurposable <lb/>drugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment of <lb/></body>

			<body>HCoVs. However, further preclinical experiments and clinical trials are required to verify <lb/>the clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use. <lb/>Network-based Identification of Potential Drug Combinations for HCoV <lb/>Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an <lb/>important role in treating various viral infections [61] . However, our ability to identify and <lb/>validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both <lb/>the large number of drug pairs and dosage combinations. In our recent study, we <lb/>proposed a novel network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug <lb/>combinations [25] . Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, <lb/>we found that a drug combination was therapeutically effective only if it was captured by <lb/>the &apos;Complementary Exposure&apos; pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the disease <lb/>module, but target separate neighborhoods (Figure 6A). Here we sought to identify <lb/>drug combinations that may provide a synergistic effect in treating HCoVs with well-<lb/>defined mechanism-of-action by network analysis. For the 16 potential repurposable <lb/>drugs (Figure 5A), we showcased three network-predicted candidate drug <lb/>combinations in the potential treatment of HCoVs. <lb/>Sirolimus plus Dactinomycin. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR with both <lb/>antifungal and antineoplastic properties, has demonstrated to improves outcomes in <lb/>patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure [47] . The mTOR <lb/>signaling plays an essential role for MERS-CoV infection [62] . Dactinomycin, also known <lb/>actinomycin D, is an approved RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various cancer <lb/></body>

			<body>types. An early study showed that dactinomycin (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the growth of <lb/>feline enteric CoV [63] . As shown in Figure 6B, our network analysis shows that sirolimus <lb/>and dactinomycin synergistically target HCoV-associated host protein subnetwork by <lb/>&apos;Complementary Exposure&apos; pattern, offering potential combination regimens for <lb/>treatment of HCoV. Specifically, sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mTOR <lb/>signaling and RNA synthesis pathway (including DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) <lb/>and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B)) in HCoV infected cells (Figure 6B). <lb/>Toremifene plus Emodin. Toremifene is the approved first generation <lb/>nonsteroidal SERMs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer [64] . SERMs (including <lb/>toremifene) inhibited Ebola virus infection [17] by interacting with and destabilizing the <lb/>Ebola virus glycoprotein [36] . In vitro assays have demonstrated that toremifene inhibited <lb/>growth of MERS-CoV [16, 65] and SARA-CoV [35] (Table 1). Emodin, an anthraquinone <lb/>derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum, have been reported to have <lb/>various anti-virus effects. Specifically, emdoin inhibited SARS-CoV associated 3a <lb/>protein [66] , and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and <lb/>ACE2 [67] . Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that <lb/>combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for HCoVs <lb/>(Figure 6C). <lb/>Mercaptopurine plus Melatonin. As shown in Figure 5A, targets of both <lb/>mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associated <lb/>host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies <lb/>identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by <lb/>targeting papain-like protease [50, 51] .

Melatonin indirectly <lb/>regulates ACE2 expression, a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of HCoVs, <lb/>including 2019-nCoV [31] . JUN, also known as c-Jun, is a key host protein involving in <lb/>HCoV infectious bronchitis virus [68] . As shown in Figure 6D, mercaptopurine and <lb/>melatonin may synergistically block c-Jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets. <lb/>In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential <lb/>combination therapy for 2019-nCoV by synergistically targeting papain-like protease, <lb/>ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways (Figure 6D). However, further <lb/>experimental and clinical validations are highly warranted. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of <lb/>putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of HCoV. <lb/>Integration of drug-target networks, HCoV-host interactions, HCoV-induced <lb/>transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein-protein interactome network are <lb/>essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 <lb/>putative repurposable drugs (Figure 5) and 3 putative drug combinations (Figure 6) for <lb/>the potential treatment of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV. However, all network-predicted <lb/>repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in preclinical models and <lb/>randomized clinical trials before being used in patients. <lb/>We acknowledge several limitations in our current study. In this study, we used a <lb/>low binding affinity value of 10 µM as a threshold to define a physical drug-target <lb/></body>

			<body>interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1µM) may be a more <lb/>suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network. <lb/>Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale, experimentally <lb/>reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may <lb/>be incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations, <lb/>instead of physical bindings. We may use computational approaches to systematically <lb/>predict the drug-target interactions further [24, 69] . In addition, the collected virus-host <lb/>interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, <lb/>including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may <lb/>computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for HCoVs using sequence-based <lb/>and structure-based approaches [70] . The current systems pharmacology model cannot <lb/>separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed <lb/>pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virus-<lb/>host interactions. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often <lb/>intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles [71] , as drugs can inhibit or <lb/>activate protein functions (including antagonists versus agonists). Comprehensive <lb/>identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV, with specific biological effects <lb/>using functional genomics assays [72, 73] , will significantly improve the accuracy of current <lb/>network-based methodologies. <lb/>Owing to lack of the complete drug target information (such as the molecular <lb/>&apos;promiscuity&apos; of drugs), the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for both <lb/>repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in current network <lb/>models.

			<body>a top network-predicted candidate drug (Figure 5A) associated with HCoVs. Yet, <lb/>several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) <lb/>associated with mesalazine usage [74, 75] . Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in <lb/>vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to <lb/>predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework [25] . <lb/>However, we expect that our methodology reminds to be a useful network-based tools <lb/>for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of <lb/>multiple drugs&apos; targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome. <lb/>Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting <lb/>nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable <lb/>drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, <lb/>combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir [76] ) with the network-<lb/>predicted repurposable drugs (Figure 5) or drug combinations (Figure 6) may improve <lb/>coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network <lb/>framework. <lb/>In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrated network-based systems <lb/>pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug <lb/>combinations for the potential treatment of HCoV. Our approach can minimize the <lb/>translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a <lb/>significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the <lb/>emerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the <lb/>network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other <lb/>types of virus and human diseases as well. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure Legends <lb/>Figure 1. Overall workflow of this study. Our network-based methodology combines <lb/>a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay <lb/>between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. (A) <lb/>Human coronavirus (HCoV) associated host proteins were collected from literatures and <lb/>pooled to generate a pan-HCoV protein subnetwork. (B) Network proximity between <lb/>drug targets and HCoV-associated proteins was calculated to screen for candidate <lb/>repurposable drugs for HCoVs under the human protein interactome model. (C &amp; D) <lb/>Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to validate the network-based prediction. (E) <lb/>Top candidates were further prioritized for drug combinations using network-based <lb/>method captured by the &apos;Complementary Exposure&apos; pattern: the targets of the drugs <lb/>both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human <lb/>interactome network. (F) Overall hypothesis of network-based methodology: (i) the <lb/>proteins that functionally associate with HCoVs are localized in the corresponding <lb/>subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome network; and (ii) proteins that <lb/>serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for <lb/>potential antiviral infection owing to common protein-protein interactions elucidated by <lb/>the human interactome. <lb/>Figure 2.
