To test whether the olfac-<lb/>tory neuroepithelium may represent a target of the virus, we generated RNA-<lb/>seq libraries from human olfactory neuroepithelia, in which we found substantial <lb/>expression of the genes coding for the virus receptor angiotensin-converting <lb/>enzyme-2 (ACE2) and for the virus internalization enhancer TMPRSS2. We <lb/>analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sus-<lb/>tentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, ex-<lb/>press ACE2 and TMPRSS2. ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of <lb/>sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues. Finally, we found <lb/>ACE2 transcripts in specific brain cell types, both in mice and humans. Sustentac-<lb/>ular cells thus represent a potential entry door for SARS-CoV-2 in a neuronal sen-<lb/>sory system that is in direct connection with the brain. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>A novel virus from the Coronaviridae family, termed SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in December 2019 in East <lb/>Asia, is currently expanding on the planet. Its exact history is unknown, but its genomic sequence suggests <lb/>that it was transmitted from bats to humans via an intermediate animal host (Zhou et al., 2020). It is now <lb/>transmitted from human to human (Chan et al., 2020) and from human to cat (Shi et al., 2020). Infection <lb/>by SARS-CoV-2 is associated in our species with a severe respiratory syndrome called COVID-19 and is <lb/>characterized by a substantial mortality rate (Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020). <lb/>Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells depends on the Spike protein (S), which is present on the virus capsid <lb/>(Letko et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Viral attachment involves an interaction between S and the angio-<lb/>tensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), located on the surface of the target cell. One reported mechanism <lb/>facilitating virus entry consists, in association with ACE2, in the priming of S by the cellular serine protease <lb/>TMPRSS2, also attached to the cellular membrane, which eventually leads to the fusion between the cellular <lb/>and the viral membranes (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Expectedly, the main targets of SARS-<lb/>CoV-2, respiratory cells that line the respiratory airways, coexpress ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Bertram et al., <lb/>2012). Other proteins have been proposed to mediate SARS-CoV-2 internalization, in particular CD147 <lb/>(Wang et al., 2020c) as an alternative receptor, and cathepsin (Ou et al., 2020) and furin-like proteases <lb/>(Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020) as internalization activators. <lb/>Starting with anecdotal reports, both from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and medical staff that suggested <lb/>an association between viral infection and alterations of olfactory perception (Giacomelli et al., 2020; Per-<lb/>rigo, 2020) (and also taste sensitivity), the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory dysfunction is <lb/>today clearly established (Heidari et al., 2020; Hopkins et al., 2020; Luers et al., 2020; Moein et al., 2020; <lb/>Spinato et al., 2020; Xydakis et al., 2020). A smartphone app recording self-reported olfactory symptoms <lb/>is even used to predict potential COVID-19 (Menni et al., 2020). The olfactory perturbations, which range <lb/>from mild to more severe, are usually reversible and affect up to 95% of patients with COVID-19 depending <lb/>on the report. Whether this olfactory perturbation results from a deterioration of the nasal sensor or of a <lb/>more central perturbation is unclear, but the second hypothesis is not to be discarded since neurological <lb/>manifestations of brain origin also appear to be associated with COVID-19 infection (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al., <lb/></body>

			<body>the identification of a given smell. This epithelium is pseudostratified and includes Bowman&apos;s glands, ol-<lb/>factory sensory neurons, sustentacular cells, microvillar cells, globose, and horizontal basal cells (cells <lb/>that keep dividing during adult life and replenish the pool of sensory neurons) (Moulton and Beidler, <lb/>1967). Each sensory neuron extends a single axon toward the olfactory bulb, which crosses the cribriform <lb/>plate before reaching the olfactory bulb in the brain. On its apical side, the olfactory neuron extends a <lb/>dendrite, which ends in multiple and long specialized cilia in contact with the outside world. These are <lb/>covered with odorant receptors and bath in the mucus that lines the nasal cavity. Olfactory sensory neuron <lb/>dendrites are enwrapped inside specialized cells, termed sustentacular cells (Liang, 2018), whose nuclei <lb/>and cell bodies line the external layer of the thick neuroepithelium (although they remain attached to <lb/>the basal lamina). The role played by the latter in maintaining the integrity and function of the neuroepi-<lb/>thelium is critical, in a very similar way that Sertoli cells support germ cell development and survival. Indeed, <lb/>contact of the olfactory mucosa with various drugs (such as 3-methylindole [Miller and O&apos;Bryan, 2003], the <lb/>anti-thyroid drug methimazole [Bergstrom et al., 2003], or nickel sulfate [Jia et al., 2010]) to which susten-<lb/>tacular cells are very sensitive leads to transient anosmia. <lb/>Whether the apparent olfactory dysfunction associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection results from a general <lb/>inflammation of the nasal cavity or from a more direct perturbation of the olfactory neuroepithelium (or ol-<lb/>factory bulb) is unclear (Cooper et al., 2020). In any case, it is critical to determine whether this virus dis-<lb/>poses of a niche to replicate just under the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, a structure with large holes <lb/>through which olfactory neuron axonal projections directly contact the olfactory bulb and offer a potential <lb/>gateway to the brain. This latter, if expressing SARS-CoV2 receptors, could in turn become infected. <lb/>We asked whether specific cells present in the human olfactory neuroepithelium as well as cells in the brain <lb/>may represent targets to SARS-CoV-2, by looking at the molecular players involved in infection, both at the <lb/>RNA and protein levels. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Human Sustentacular and Respiratory Ciliated Cells <lb/>We collected biopsies via nasal endoscopic surgery from four adult patients and explored the potential <lb/>expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Samples of both nasal respiratory and olfactory sensory epithelia <lb/>were harvested. Bulk tissue RNA was extracted and libraries were generated and sequenced (Figure 1B). <lb/>To assess the specificity of our dissection, we performed a differential expression analysis between the res-<lb/>piratory and olfactory epithelia datasets (Figure 1B). As expected, olfactory-specific genes, including olfac-<lb/>tory receptor genes, CNGA2 and ANO2, OMP, and ERMN (encoding critical elements of the olfactory <lb/>transduction cascade, a specific marker of mature olfactory sensory neurons and a marker of sustentacular <lb/>cells, respectively), were significantly enriched in olfactory samples (Figures 1C-1E). The presence of ACE2 <lb/>and TMPRSS2 transcripts was then evaluated. We observed a mean of 7.1 and 63.7 TPMs in the respiratory <lb/>epithelium samples for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (Figures 1F and 1G), reflecting the presence of <lb/>ciliated cells, which represent targets of SARS-CoV-2. We found a mean of 4.6 and 76.1 TPMs in the sensory <lb/>neuroepithelium samples for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (Figures 1F and 1G), indicating the pres-<lb/>ence in this tissue of cells that may express both genes, or of a mix of cells that express either TMPRSS2 <lb/>or ACE2. <lb/>To identify putative viral targets transcribing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the neuroepithelium, we took <lb/>advantage of a very recently published dataset reported by Durante et al. (2020). This dataset contains <lb/>the transcriptome of 28,726 single cells, collected during nasal endoscopic surgery of four adult patients. <lb/>Prior to any cell type analysis, we monitored the existence of cells that would transcribe both ACE2 and <lb/>TMPRSS2 (Figure 2A). We then performed an aggregate analysis of the 28,726 single cells and generated <lb/>a UMAP dimensionality reduction plot, which allowed to display the clustering of the 26 different cell types <lb/>reported in the original publication (Durante et al., 2020), including olfactory, respiratory, and immune cells <lb/>(Figure 2B). We then identified all cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, ERMN (an olfactory sustentacular cell <lb/>marker) and GSTA2 (a marker of respiratory ciliated and epithelial cells) (Figures 2C, 2E, 2H, and 2I), and <lb/>those coexpressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (Figures 2D, 2H, and 2I). Olfactory sensory neu-<lb/>rons showed little or no expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, respectively (Figure 2C). In contrast, different <lb/>types of respiratory cells, and also olfactory sustentacular cells, expressed ACE2. Many of these cells also <lb/>coexpressed TMPRSS2.

			<body>cellular populations, we plotted the mean normalized expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 corre-<lb/>sponding to each of these subpopulations (Figure 2E). Sustentacular cells and ciliated respiratory cells ex-<lb/>hibited the highest levels of expression of both genes. Populations containing olfactory horizontal cells, <lb/>microvillar cells, and Bowman&apos;s glands also showed transcription of both genes, although at lower levels. <lb/>To better evaluate the different expression levels inside the two cell types expressing the highest levels of <lb/>both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we plotted the distribution of normalized transcript levels across all cells of both <lb/>cell types (Figures 2F and 2G). Finally, the number (Figure 2H) and percentage (Figure 2I) of cells expressing <lb/>ACE2, TMPRSS, or both genes were evaluated. <lb/>Respiratory cells are thus not the only cells in contact with the outside world that exhibit the molecular keys <lb/>involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry in the nose. Sustentacular cells, which lie at the interface between the central <lb/>nervous system and the olfactory cavity, share the same characteristics. <lb/>ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Protein Expression in the Olfactory Neuroepithelium <lb/>Quantification of gene transcripts at the single cell level, a commonly used proxy of protein abundance, <lb/>often leads to very inaccurate predictions, up to a complete discordance between real transcript and pro-<lb/>tein levels (Bauernfeind and Babbitt, 2017; Liu et al., 2016). Since it is the protein that matters here, and at <lb/>the individual cell level, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tissues by immunohisto-<lb/>chemistry. Given that ortholog tissue specificity is highly conserved between tetrapod species (Kryuchkova-<lb/>Mostacci and Robinson-Rechavi, 2016), and in particular between mouse and humans (Liao and Zhang, <lb/>2006), we analyzed mouse tissues in parallel to human ones. <lb/>We first evaluated the potential ACE2 immunoreactivity of the mouse olfactory epithelium (Figures 3A and <lb/>3B). To assess antibody specificity, we used independently three different anti-ACE2 antibodies, which <lb/>were raised against the extracellular part (Ab1 and Ab3 developed in goat and rabbit, respectively) or <lb/>the intracellular part of ACE2 (Ab2, developed in rabbit). These antibodies were first evaluated to label co-<lb/>lon and kidney tissues, which contain previously described ACE2-expressing cell types (Figures S1A-S1J). <lb/>In the olfactory cavity, a strong and defined labeling was observed in the respiratory epithelium in the nasal <lb/>cavity and nasopharyngeal duct (Figures S3A-S3H), and in a subset of sustentacular cells lining the nasal <lb/>cavity (Figures 3C-3G and S3B). These were almost exclusively located in the dorsal part of the epithelium, <lb/>with a relatively abrupt transition area (Figures 3H and 3I). All antibodies showed a labeling of the apical <lb/>portion of sustentacular cells, except for a slight labeling of their somata with Ab2 (Figure 3D). To clearly <lb/>differentiate olfactory sensory neurons from sustentacular cells, we colabeled the sections with TUJ1 (a <lb/>marker of neurons), OMP (a marker of mature sensory neurons),and ERMN (a marker of sustentacular cells) <lb/>(Figures 3J-3M, 3O, 3Q, and 3R). The localization of ACE2 was at the very luminal border of the sustentac-<lb/>ular cells, sandwiched between the sensory neurons TUJ1-expressing cilia and ERMN, which labels the api-<lb/>cal part of sustentacular cells (Figures 3J-3S). We also evaluated TMPRSS2 immunoreactivity in the mouse <lb/>olfactory epithelium (Figures 3N and 3P). We tested two different antibodies, which were first evaluated on <lb/>kidney tissue (Figure S2). In the mouse main olfactory epithelium, sustentacular cells were positive for <lb/>TMPRSS2, and several other cell types showed weak expression (Figures 3N, S2A, S2B, S2E, and S2F). <lb/>We then evaluated the expression of ACE2 in the human nasal cavity by immunohistochemistry. Similarly to <lb/>what is observed in the mouse, the human neuroepithelium can be discriminated from the respiratory <lb/>epithelium by the presence of TUJ1-positive olfactory sensory neurons (Figure 4A), ERMN-positive <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>sustentacular cells along the apical border of the tissue (Figures 4A and S4C-S4E), as well as the absence of <lb/>Alcian blue-labeled goblet cells (Figure 4B). In accordance with the single-cell data, a strong labeling of <lb/>ACE2 was observed in some sustentacular cells of the sensory epithelium (Figures 4C-4G). However, the <lb/>very apical localization of ACE2 observed in the mouse neuroepithelium was not recapitulated in humans, <lb/>but ACE2 was rather enriched in the apical half of the cells. A similar somatic staining was also observed, <lb/>with the same antibody, in proximal tubule cells of the mouse kidney (Figure S1D). Congruently with its <lb/>pervasiveness in the single-cell transcriptomes, TMPRSS2 labeling was observed in many constituents of <lb/>the nasal epithelium (Figures 4H, S4F, and S4G). <lb/>We sought to investigate whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus was present in sustentacular cells of patients in-<lb/>fected with the virus. The olfactory sensory epithelium of two deceased SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals <lb/>was analyzed. It was found to be highly damaged and largely detached from the basal lamina (Figure S5), <lb/>hindering the potential identification of viral particles in sustentacular cells. Whether this damage was <lb/>caused by the virus cannot be determined based on the few samples analyzed. However, a study of <lb/>SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters showed infection of sustentacular cells and a massive desquamation <lb/>of the olfactory epithelium (Bryche et al., 2020). <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Expression in the Brain <lb/>SARS-CoV (i.e., the virus responsible for the previous SARS epidemic in 2002), the genome of which is <lb/>closely related to the one of SARS-CoV-2 and whose effects on human tissues appear similar to those <lb/>observed with SARS-CoV-2, has been observed in human brains (Ding et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005; Xu <lb/>et al., 2005). Could SARS-CoV-2 replicate in the olfactory epithelium and could the infection spread to <lb/>the brain? To explore the potential receptivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the various cell types in the brain, <lb/>we evaluated, again, the potential coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in neuronal and non-neuronal cell <lb/>types in the central nervous system of both mice and humans. <lb/>For the mouse, we took advantage of two available single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets (Saun-<lb/>ders et al., 2018; Zeisel et al., 2018), consisting in two broad collections of mouse brain cell types. In the first <lb/>collection, published by Zeisel et al. (2018), which includes non-neuronal cells, we found a very limited num-<lb/>ber of cell types that expressed Ace2 (Figure 5A). These cells are related to pericytes and coexpress the <lb/>mural cell marker Rgs5 (Figure 5B). Tmprss2, whose transcripts were barely detected, was expressed by <lb/>even fewer cell types (Figure 5A), with Purkinje cells displaying the highest expression level. These obser-<lb/>vations were confirmed by the second mouse dataset (Saunders et al., 2018), in which mural cells were the <lb/>main cell type that expressed Ace2 (Figure 5C). None of these cell populations coexpressed Tmprss2. <lb/>Although our data showed substantial expression of ACE2 in the mouse brain, they did not replicate the <lb/>widespread expression of ACE2 in the central nervous system previously reported by others, which found <lb/>ACE2 in the motor cortex, raphe, and nuclei involved in the regulation of cardiovascular function (Doobay <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>et al., 2007). To precisely evaluate the expression of ACE2 in the mouse brain, and in particular at the inter-<lb/>face with the olfactory sensory neuroepithelium, we performed an immunostaining of mouse olfactory bulb <lb/>sections with the three different anti-ACE2 antibodies. A strong labeling of capillary-associated cells was <lb/>observed through the different layers of the olfactory bulb (Figures 5D-5H), in agreement with the single-<lb/>cell RNA-seq observations. <lb/>Finally, we explored two single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets to evaluate ACE2 expression in the human brain. <lb/>In the first dataset (Lake et al. (2018)), we found neuronal and glial cell types, in particular Purkinje neurons <lb/>and cerebellar astrocytes, that expressed ACE2 or TMPRSS2 (Figures S6A-S6E). In the second dataset, <lb/>publicly available in the Allen Brain Map cell types database, we found expression of ACE2 (although at <lb/>relatively limited levels) in various non-neuronal and neuronal types, in particular astrocytes, oligodendro-<lb/>cytes, and neurons from the cortical layer 5 (Figures 6A-6G), a portion of which coexpressed TMPRSS2 (Fig-<lb/>ures 6C-6E). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are therefore expressed in a number of cell types in the human brain. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Facing the current pandemic, worldwide efforts have been made to better understand the molecular bases <lb/>of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we aimed at investigating the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor <lb/>ACE-2 in the human olfactory neuroepithelium and in the brain. Other groups, whose results are mostly <lb/>in line with our findings, have also addressed parallel questions (Bilinska et al., 2020; Brann et al., 2020a, <lb/>2020b; Sungnak et al., 2020). <lb/>Taking a multidisciplinary approach, based both on our own and publicly available RNA-seq datasets, and <lb/>on immunohistochemical staining of mouse and human tissues, we demonstrate here that a subset of ol-<lb/>factory sustentacular cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium, but not olfactory sensory neurons, expresses <lb/>B <lb/>ACE2 TUJ1 <lb/>G <lb/>F <lb/>ACE2 <lb/>ACE2 TUJ1 <lb/>C <lb/>alcian blue <lb/>ERMN TUJ1 <lb/>A <lb/>TMPRSS2 TUJ1 <lb/>B <lb/>alcian blue <lb/>D <lb/>C <lb/>E <lb/>H <lb/>ACE2 TUJ1 <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>ACE2, the main player in the binding and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. These cells were found <lb/>to coexpress TMPRSS2, a serine protease known to facilitate viral entry. We also found ACE2 expression in <lb/>specific cell types of the brain, including neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. <lb/>We first determined, using transcriptomic analyses of whole tissue and single cells from human olfactory <lb/>epithelia, that a subset of sustentacular cells expresses ACE2. We recently reported this finding as a pre-<lb/>print on BioRxiv (Fodoulian et al., 2020), which is in agreement with another preprint on the same server <lb/>(Brann et al., 2020a). We then confirmed this finding in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry. <lb/>In the mouse, in which the olfactory mucosa is particularly well organized both in terms of pseudostratified <lb/>layers and in terms of its very strict separation from the respiratory epithelium, we observed (similarly to <lb/>humans) a clear expression of ACE2 in the apical border of sustentacular cells (in agreement with a very <lb/>recent report citing our BioRxiv article [Bilinska et al., 2020]). This distribution was, however, non-homog-<lb/>enous, since ACE2 was present in the most dorsally located sustentacular cells, but was entirely absent from <lb/>more ventrally located ones. Such dichotomy between the dorsal and the ventral neuroepithelium is remi-<lb/>niscent, in the mouse, of the dorsally located olfactory neurons, which are known to share molecular <lb/>markers that are dissimilar from those present in more ventral neurons (Gussing and Bohm, 2004). This <lb/>known contrast is not limited to the neuronal identities, since the function and response to stress of these <lb/>dorsally located neurons also appear to be different (Kobayakawa et al., 2007; Tuerdi et al., 2018). We now <lb/>add a non-neuronal cell type to this dorsoventral neural dichotomy. In the human olfactory neuroepithe-<lb/>lium, a similar labeling of ACE2 was observed in sustentacular cells, although the staining was mainly pre-<lb/>sent in the somata. Again, as observed in the mouse, some of these cells were positive and others were <lb/>negative for ACE2. These human ACE2-expressing sustentacular cells were found isolated or in small clus-<lb/>ters, intermingled with sustentacular cells negative for ACE2, or even sometimes intermingled with respi-<lb/>ratory epithelium, an expected observation given the relatively poor organization of the human olfactory <lb/>neuroepithelium, in particular in aged individuals. <lb/>How likely is it that the coexpression of ACE2 in olfactory sustentacular cells is involved in the SARS-CoV-2-<lb/>induced anosmia? And why are horizontal basal cells that also express ACE2 not prime candidates? First, <lb/>given the slow rate of neuronal renewal in the main olfactory epithelium (a few months) and the apparent <lb/>rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-triggered anosmia, a perturbation of the stem cell pool constituted by <lb/>the horizontal basal cells appears unlikely to represent an immediate disturbance to the system. Second, <lb/>the amounts of ACE2 transcripts as well as the intensity of the immunohistological staining we observed in <lb/>sustentacular cells are in the same range as the ones observed in respiratory ciliated cells, suggesting at <lb/>least that sustentacular cells play in the same league in terms of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Third, sustentacular <lb/>cells are in direct contact with the olfactory cavity and thus interact with everything that enters the nose. <lb/>Fourth, sustentacular cells play a critical role in the maintenance of the olfactory neuroepithelium integrity: <lb/>their loss or suffering would cause disaggregation or malfunctioning of the neuroepithelium, respectively, <lb/>leading to anosmia. Supporting this, SARS-CoV-2 infection of golden hamsters via the nasal route leads to <lb/>massive damage of the olfactory neuroepithelium (Bryche et al., 2020). Finally, given that the role played by <lb/>ACE2 in sustentacular cells is unknown, the hijack of this receptor by SARS-CoV-2 may by itself perturb the <lb/>functioning of the olfactory sensor. Taken together, and despite the fact that one cannot exclude inflam-<lb/>mation and the infection of other non-neuronal cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium as an origin <lb/>of the SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia, the link between the viral molecular entry tools expressed by olfac-<lb/>tory sustentacular cells and the SARS-CoV-2-induced chemosensory alteration appears quite credible. <lb/>The idea that viruses may affect directly or indirectly the integrity and function of the sensory part of the olfac-<lb/>tory system is not new. Some viruses indeed disturb the neuroepithelium in different ways, and often alter spe-<lb/>cific cell types, including neurons. For example, and among many others, olfactory sensory neurons and sus-<lb/>tentacular cells were shown to be major portals of host entry of the Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) (Milho et al., <lb/>2012). Again, the direct contact of this latter cell type with the respiratory tract, as well as its phagocytic activity, <lb/>Figure 5.

			<body>may explain its particular sensitivity to viral infection. The cell type targeted by viruses matters, in particular to <lb/>fight infection using drugs. For instance, in the case of a MuHV-4 challenge, olfactory sensory neurons are not <lb/>responsive to interferon treatment (IFNg), whereas sustentacular cells are (Jacobs et al., 2019). <lb/>SARS-CoV-2-infection has not only been linked to the loss of a single chemosensory ability. Indeed, in addition <lb/>to anosmia, ageusia has also been reported (Cooper et al., 2020; Giacomelli et al., 2020). Whether these re-<lb/>ports truly reflect taste anomalies or rather olfactory perturbations that may drastically affect the flavor of <lb/>food is unclear. However, this potential double effect on two chemosensory systems that share nothing at <lb/>the periphery may suggest a more central alteration, involving, for example, a direct infection of the brain <lb/>by SARS-CoV-2. But this would require potential targets. We identified various cell types in the brain that ex-<lb/>press ACE2, although at relatively low levels in humans. In the mouse, we detected ACE2 expression in brain <lb/>vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, but not in neurons. In humans, we found ACE2 transcripts in non-<lb/>neuronal cell types such as astrocytes and microglia, and also in neurons, in particular Purkinje and cortical <lb/>layer 5 neurons. Whether these different cell types reflect differences in tissue specificity between the two <lb/>mammalian species is unclear, since RNA-seq discordances may result from differences in the sequencing <lb/>depth, sequencing protocols (single-nucleus versus single-cell RNA-seq), dissimilar mRNA half-lives, or vari-<lb/>able cell type selection strategies between the different studies. But whatever the reason for the discordances, <lb/>these data point to potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in brain cells. <lb/>Similar to the infection of the olfactory neuroepithelium by SARS-CoV-2, the transport of viral particles from <lb/>the olfactory mucosa to the brain would not be a first. In 1935 already, the olfactory route was hypothesized <lb/>(because of its direct connection with the brain) to represent a portal for entry of viruses into the central <lb/>nervous system (Flexner, 1936). We know today that the olfactory nerve route is indeed used by various vi-<lb/>ruses to reach the brain, including HSV1, poliovirus, MHV (a coronavirus), paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus, <lb/>Nipah virus, influenza virus, adenoviruses, bunyaviruses, and VSV (Durrant et al., 2016). <lb/>Although most pathogenic microorganisms appear to access the CNS via the axons of olfactory sensory <lb/>neurons, other routes of entry through the cribriform plate have been described. For instance, the ameba <lb/>Naegleria fowleri penetrates the olfactory epithelium either via sustentacular cells or in a paracellular way <lb/>and then travels along the nerve bundle through the cribriform plate (Jarolim et al., 2000). Moreover, the <lb/>bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes a widespread loss of OSNs, which leads to the degeneration <lb/>of the olfactory nerves (St John et al., 2014). B. pseudomallei then migrates along the empty conduits of <lb/>olfactory nerves toward the CNS. An even more convincing example may be the neurotropic MHV virus, <lb/>which is found in high concentrations within the perineurium of the olfactory nerve and in the brain after <lb/>nasal infection (Barthold, 1988) (olfactory sensory neurons lack the main MHV virus receptor CEACAM1 <lb/>[Brann et al., 2020b; Miura et al., 2008). <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 virions have in fact been observed in the human olfactory bulb (Nampoothiri et al., 2020). <lb/>SARS-CoV particles have also been found in the human brain (Ding et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005; Xu et al., <lb/>2005). Adding to these observations, brain lesions were observed in a transgenic mouse model expressing <lb/>the human ACE2 in the nose and infected intranasally with SARS-CoV (Netland et al., 2008). Moreover, a <lb/>retrospective case study on 214 patients with COVID-19 reported neurological manifestations possibly <lb/>correlated with the severity of the disease (Mao et al., 2020) (with the confounding factor that old people <lb/>are more likely to develop severe disease). As worrying are suggestions that a subset of patients infected <lb/>with the virus but lacking respiratory symptoms may exhibit neurologic symptoms (Wang et al., 2020b) and <lb/>that they may be associated with encephalitis (Moriguchi et al., 2020; Poyiadji et al., 2020), Miller Fisher syn-<lb/>drome, and polyneuritis cranialis (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al., 2020). Given, as we showed here, the presence in <lb/>the human brain of various neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations expressing ACE2, this certainly ap-<lb/>pears to be a line of investigation worth pursuing. <lb/>Limitations of the Study <lb/>We investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus was present in sustentacular cells of patients infected with <lb/>the virus. We analyzed the olfactory sensory epithelium of two deceased SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. <lb/>However, the epithelium was found to be highly damaged and largely detached from the basal lamina, hin-<lb/>dering the potential identification of viral particles in sustentacular cells. Hence, we could not determine <lb/>whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus is indeed present in sustentacular cells of infected patients. Whether the his-<lb/>tological damage was caused by the virus cannot be determined based on the few samples analyzed. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Transparent Methods <lb/>Human biopsies and bulk RNA sequencing <lb/>After authorization from the University of Geneva ethics commission (authorization CE-<lb/>13-115) and the informed consent from all subjects, human biopsies were collected at the <lb/>Geneva University Hospital. For whole tissue RNA-seq, samples of 4 individuals (3 males <lb/>and 1 females, age between 45-55 years) were resected during nasal cavity surgeries <lb/>under general anesthesia. Biopsies consisted in small pieces of tissue of approximately <lb/>3 mm in diameter, from the respiratory or the sensory epithelia. Biopsies were snap frozen <lb/>in liquid nitrogen immediately upon collection. One patient had only an OE biopsy and <lb/>another only a RE biopsy. For RNA extraction, tissues were placed in RLT Buffer (Qiagen) <lb/>with beta-mercaptoethanol and lysed with stainless steel balls (5mm diameter, Schieritz <lb/>and Huenstein AG) using a homogenizer (Big Prep, MB Biomedicals). Total RNA was <lb/>isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer protocol. The quality <lb/>and quantity of total RNA were evaluated with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Stranded cDNA <lb/>libraries with suitable adapters for multiplexing were generated with Truseq RNA and <lb/>DNA sample preparation kits (Illumina) following ribodepletion of the total RNA (200ng of <lb/>total RNA per sample). Samples were multiplexed for sequencing in a HiSeq®2500 <lb/>Sequencing system, generating 100bp single-end reads. Each patient represented an <lb/>independent biological replicate. <lb/>Bulk RNA sequencing data analysis <lb/>RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the GRCh38 human genome assembly with STAR <lb/>(Dobin et al., 2013) version 2.7.0a using the Ensembl v99 gene annotation file (GTF). <lb/>Mutlimapped reads were filtered out with the option --outFilterMultimapNmax set to 1. <lb/>Reversely stranded gene expression quantification was carried using featureCounts (Liao <lb/>et al., 2014) version 1.6.3 and a modified version of the aforementioned GTF file. The <lb/>records corresponding to AC097625.2, a newly annotated long non-coding RNA that <lb/>spans and shares most exons of ACE2, were removed from the GTF file as they <lb/>hampered ACE2 quantification (due to ambiguous read counting). This gene had a total <lb/>of 3 detected counts in two samples and its removal from the GTF file led on average to <lb/>a 9-fold increase in ACE2 counts. Note that this annotation was absent from and did not <lb/>affect the single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets as it first appeared in the GENCODE <lb/>release 30 and the Ensembl release 96 of the GRCh38 GTF files. Differential gene <lb/>expression analysis between olfactory epithelial (OE) biopsies and respiratory epithelial <lb/>(RE) biopsies was performed using the DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) Bioconductor package <lb/>version 1.22.2 in R version 3.5.0. After fitting a negative binomial generalized linear model <lb/>(GLM), the Wald test (two-tailed) was used to test for significance of gene expression <lb/>differences as a function of biopsies at a log2 fold change threshold of 0. To control the <lb/>false discovery rate, the Wald test p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using <lb/>the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Patient <lb/>identifications were not added to the model to control for potential differences in gene <lb/>expression between individuals (i.e. batch effects) due to the underpowered experimental <lb/>design highlighted by the 3 samples per condition. The Approximate Posterior Estimation <lb/>for GLM coefficients (an adaptive Bayesian shrinkage estimator) implemented in the <lb/>apeglm (Zhu et al., 2019) Bioconductor package version 1.4.2 was used to shrink log2 <lb/>fold changes. During shrinkage, the maximum likelihood estimates (i.e. log2 fold changes) <lb/>and their associated standard errors (both in log scale) were used to adapt the scale of <lb/>the prior. The results of this analysis are represented as a volcano plot in Figure 1C. To <lb/>display the expression levels of selected genes in individual samples (Figure 1D-1G), <lb/>TPM values were calculated for each gene within each sample to normalize for <lb/>sequencing depth differences. Olfactory cascade genes (i.e. OMP, CNGA2 and ANO2) <lb/>and the top 4 most differentially expressed OR genes (with the lowest adjusted p-values) <lb/>were selected as markers of the olfactory neurosensory epithelium. ERMN was selected <lb/>as a marker of sustentacular cells (Liang, 2018; Tang et al., 2009). <lb/>Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis of human olfactory epithelial <lb/>cells <lb/>Data download: The processed 10X Genomics output files of all four patients of the single-<lb/>cell RNA-seq dataset reported in Durante et al. (Durante et al., 2020) were downloaded <lb/>from NCBI GEO: GSE139522. This dataset consists in human olfactory and respiratory <lb/>epithelial cells collected from four patients aged between 41 and 52 years. The data was <lb/>analyzed in R version 3.5.0 using the Seurat (Butler et al., 2018; Satija et al., 2015; Stuart <lb/>et al., 2019) R package version 3.1.4 following the indications described in Durante et al. <lb/>(Durante et al., 2020) and using custom scripts. <lb/>Cell and gene filtering: The 10X files were loaded into R using the Read10X function of <lb/>Seurat. A single Seurat object for all four patients was created using the <lb/>CreateSeuratObject function of Seurat. At this step, genes not expressed in at least 3 <lb/>cells at a threshold of a minimum of 1 UMI count were excluded from the analysis <lb/>(min.cells = 3). The percentage of mitochondrial counts was then calculated for each cell <lb/>using the PercentageFeatureSet function of Seurat. Cells were removed from the analysis <lb/>if they had less than 400 detected UMI counts, expressed less than 100 or more than <lb/>6000 genes, and if their mitochondrial counts exceeded 10% of their total counts. This <lb/>filtering resulted in retaining 28,726 cells and 26,439 genes. <lb/>Dataset integration: The standard Seurat version 3 (Stuart et al., 2019) integration <lb/>workflow was used to integrate the data from all patients, as described in Durante et al. <lb/>(Durante et al., 2020) First, the data from each patient was separated using the <lb/>SplitObject function of Seurat. The raw UMI counts of each gene within each cell were <lb/>normalized by the total number of UMI counts per cell, scaled to 10 4 and natural-log-<lb/>transformed after adding a pseudocount of 1 using the NormalizeData function of Seurat <lb/>(normalization.method = &quot;LogNormalize&quot;; scale.factor = 10000). The top 5000 variable <lb/>genes were then determined in each dataset using the variance-stabilizing transformation <lb/>(Stuart et al., 2019) method of the FindVariableFeatures function of Seurat <lb/>(selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;; nfeatures = 5000). To assemble all datasets, integration <lb/>anchors (i.e. mutual nearest neighbors) across the four datasets were identified with the <lb/>FindIntegrationAnchors function of Seurat after computing the first 30 dimensions of the <lb/>canonical correlation analysis(Butler et al., 2018) between each pair of datasets using the <lb/>top 5000 variable genes shared between most datasets (reduction = &quot;cca&quot;; dims = 1:30; <lb/>anchor.features = 5000; l2.norm = TRUE). The IntegrateData function of Seurat was then <lb/>used to integrate all four datasets into a single Seurat object. <lb/>UMAP plot generation: To generate a UMAP (Becht et al., 2018; McInnes et al., 2018) <lb/>plot, the integrated data was scaled and centered using the ScaleData function of Seurat <lb/>and the first 30 principle components were computed using the RunPCA function of <lb/>Seurat. These 30 principle components were then used as input to the RunUMAP function <lb/>of Seurat (dims = 1:30). The UMAP plot was generated with the uwot R package version <lb/>0.1.8 implementation. The cosine metric was used to measure distance and find the <lb/>nearest neighbors (metric = &quot;cosine&quot;), the number of neighbors used for the <lb/>approximation of the manifold structure was set to 30 (n.neighbors = 30) and the effective <lb/>minimum distance between embedded points was set to 0.3 (spread = 1; min.dist = 0.3). <lb/>The clusters identified by Durante et al.(Durante et al., 2020) were displayed on the UMAP <lb/>plot (Figure 2B) and were used for subsequent analyses. The cluster corresponding to <lb/>&quot;Respiratory columnar cells&quot; was renamed as &quot;Respiratory early secretory cells&quot; based <lb/>on its expression of SERPINB3 (see Supplementary Table 3 from Durante et al. (Durante <lb/>et al., 2020)). <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Gene expression analysis and plotting: All gene expression analyses were performed <lb/>using the actual normalized UMI counts (not log-transformed) from the non-integrated <lb/>assay of the Seurat object. However, the scales of the axes in the violin plots (Figure 2A, <lb/>F and G) and the color gradient scales in the heatmap plots (Figure 2C) are in log10 after <lb/>adding a pseudocount of 1 to the normalized UMI counts. The axes in Figure 2E, 2H and <lb/>2I are not in log scale. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpressing cells were identified as <lb/>expressing at least 1 UMI count of both genes (Figure 2D). All violins in each violin plot <lb/>have the same maximum width. <lb/>Droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing data analysis of human brain cells <lb/>Data download: The digital gene expression matrices of the single-nucleus Drop-seq <lb/>dataset reported in Lake et al. (Lake et al., 2018) were downloaded from NCBI GEO: <lb/>GSE97930. This dataset consists in human brain nuclei collected from the frontal cortex, <lb/>visual cortex and lateral cerebellar hemisphere from six individuals aged between 20 and <lb/>49 years (for more information, see Supplementary Table 1 from Lake et al. (Lake et al., <lb/>2018)). The data was analyzed in R version 3.5.0 using the pagoda2 R package <lb/>(https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pagoda2) version 0.1.1 following the indications described <lb/>in Lake et al. (Lake et al., 2018) and using custom scripts. For simplification, the word <lb/>&quot;cells&quot; will be used instead of &quot;nuclei&quot; in the following paragraphs. <lb/>Cell and gene filtering: All cells from the downloaded matrices had a cell type annotation <lb/>and were therefore retained for further analysis. Genes shared between all 3 datasets <lb/>(i.e. frontal cortex, visual cortex and lateral cerebellar hemisphere) were selected for <lb/>downstream analysis. The final UMI count matrix, after combining all datasets, contained <lb/>35,289 cells and 31,302 genes. <lb/>Batch correction and data preparation: A new Pagoda2 object was created and the library <lb/>identification of each cell was defined for batch correction using the plain model (see <lb/>Supplementary Table 2 from Lake et al. (Lake et al., 2018)). Winsorization was used to <lb/>clip the expression levels of each gene at the eleventh most extreme value (i.e. <lb/>winsorizing the ten most extreme values; trim = 10). Batch-corrected gene expression <lb/>levels were then normalized by the total number of counts per cell, scaled to 10 3 and <lb/>natural-log-transformed after adding a pseudocount of 1. <lb/>UMAP plot generation: The variance of genes were calculated and adjusted using the <lb/>adjustVariance function of pagoda2, as described in Lake et al. (Lake et al., 2018) (the <lb/>smoothing term of the generalized additive model was set to gam.k = 10). The 2,000 <lb/>overdispersed genes were then selected from the variance adjusted matrix and the 150 <lb/>principle components were computed using the calculatePcaReduction function of <lb/>pagoda2 (n.odgenes = 2000; nPcs = 150). These 150 principle components were then <lb/>used to generate a UMAP plot with the getEmbedding function of pagoda2 (type = &quot;PCA&quot;; <lb/>embeddingType = &quot;UMAP&quot;). As for the analysis of human olfactory epithelial cells, the <lb/>uwot R package version 0.1.8 implementation was used to generate the UMAP plot. Also, <lb/>the cosine metric was used to measure distance and find the nearest neighbors (distance <lb/>= &quot;cosine&quot;), the number of neighbors used for the approximation of the manifold structure <lb/>was set to 15 (n_neighbors = 15) and the effective minimum distance between embedded <lb/>points was set to 0.1 (spread = 1; min_dist = 0.1). <lb/>Gene expression analysis and plotting: To plot the expression levels of ACE2 and <lb/>TMPRSS2 on the UMAP projection in the form of a heatmap, the raw UMI counts of each <lb/>gene within each cell were normalized by the total number of UMI counts per cell and <lb/>scaled to 10 4 . Similar to Figure 2C, the color gradient scales in the heatmap plots <lb/>(Supplementary Figure 6B) are in log10 after adding a pseudocount of 1 to the normalized <lb/>UMI counts. In Supplementary Figure 6D and 6E, broader clusters were defined by <lb/>separately grouping all excitatory neuron clusters, all inhibitory neuron clusters and all <lb/>Purkinje neuron clusters. <lb/>SMART-Seq v4 single-nucleus RNA sequencing data analysis of human brain cells <lb/>Data download: The digital gene expression matrix (matrix.csv), the t-SNE coordinates <lb/>for each cell (tsne.csv) and the metadata table corresponding to the cells (metadata.csv) <lb/>were downloaded from the Allen Brain Map cell types database, available online at <lb/>https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/human-multiple-cortical-areas-<lb/>smart-seq. This dataset consists in human brain nuclei collected from three individuals <lb/>and from eight brain regions: middle temporal gyrus (MTG), cingulate gyrus (CgG), <lb/>primary visual cortex (V1C), primary auditory cortex (A1C), upper limb (ul) and lower limb <lb/>(lm) regions of both primary motor cortex (M1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) <lb/>(for more information, see metadata.csv from the website above). The data was analyzed <lb/>in R version 3.5.0 using custom scripts. Like in the above paragraphs, the word &quot;cells&quot; will <lb/>be used instead of &quot;nuclei&quot; in the following paragraphs. <lb/>Cell and gene filtering: Cells lacking a brain cell-type subclass annotation (subclass_label <lb/>column from metadata.csv) and a t-SNE embedding were removed from the analysis, and <lb/>all genes were retained for data normalization. The final expression matrix contained <lb/>47,432 cells and 50,281 genes. <lb/>Gene expression analysis and plotting: Prior to any gene expression plotting or analysis, <lb/>the raw counts of each gene within each cell were normalized by the total number of <lb/>counts per cell and scaled to 10 4 . Similar to Figure 2C, the color gradient scales in the <lb/>heatmap plots (Figure 6B and 6C) are in log10 after adding a pseudocount of 1 to the <lb/>normalized counts. However, the axes in Figure 6E, F and G are not in log scale. Also, <lb/>as described above, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpressing cells were identified as <lb/>expressing at least 1 raw count of both genes (Figure 6D). <lb/>Data visualization and programming tools <lb/>All plots in Figures 1, 2 and 6, as well as in Figure S6, were generated using ggplot2 <lb/>version 3.3.0. Other R and Bioconductor packages used for data analysis and plotting <lb/>include rtracklayer(Lawrence et al., 2009) version 1.46.0, Matrix version 1.2.18, reshape2 <lb/>version 1.4.3, data.table version 1.12.8, dplyr version 0.8.5, stringr version 1.4.0, ggrepel <lb/>version 0.9.0, lemon version 0.4.4, extrafont version 0.17, viridis version 0.5.1, <lb/>RColorBrewer version 1.1.2, patchwork version 1.0.0 and grid version 3.5.0. <lb/>Mouse brain cell database mining <lb/>For mouse brain single-cell transcriptomes, the datasets of Zeisel et al. (Zeisel et al., <lb/>2018) (Figure 5A and 5B) and Sauders et al. (Saunders et al., 2018) (Figure 5C) were <lb/>analyzed from their respective websites: http://mousebrain.org/ and http://dropviz.org/. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry and histology <lb/>Tissue fixation and preparation: All animal procedures were performed in accordance with <lb/>the guidelines and regulations of the institution and of the state of Geneva. Mice (C57BL6, <lb/>Charles River Laboratories, France) were deeply anesthetized with Pentobarbitalum <lb/>natricum at 150mg/kg (Streuli Pharma) and perfused transcardially with 1x phosphate-<lb/>buffered saline (PBS)-heparine 20&apos;000 UI/l (Bichsel), pH 7.4. After flushing, mice were <lb/>perfused with 10% neutral buffered Formalin. Tissues were extracted and fixed over night <lb/>at 4°C and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose, 1x PBS over night at 4 °C followed by 30 % <lb/>sucrose, 1x PBS over night at 4 °C. Tissues were embedded in optimal cutting <lb/>temperature compound (OCT) (Carl Roth, ref. 6478.1) and cut on a cryostat in 16 µm <lb/>sections that were mounted on Superfrost+ slides. Sections were conserved at -80°C until <lb/>use. For human post-mortem samples a written consent for the anonymized research use <lb/>of biological material was obtained from relatives, in accordance with the guidelines and <lb/>regulations of the institution and of the state of Geneva. Human olfactory and respiratory <lb/>epithelia were sampled from autopsies (individual 1: female, 90 years, uninfected with <lb/>SARS-CoV-2; individual 2: male, 54 years, infected with SARS-CoV-2, individual 3: male, <lb/>86 years, infected with SARS-CoV-2. By transcranial access, the cribriform plate with the <lb/>superior part of the nasal cavities and the septum nasi were removed. The postero-lateral <lb/>and postero-medial parts of the nasal mucosa were carefully dissected and fixed in 10% <lb/>neutral buffered Formalin for 48 hours and bony particles were decalcified in EDTA for 24 <lb/>hours. Paraffin embedding was done using a standard protocol using a LOGOS <lb/>Microwave Hybrid Tissue Processor (Milestone). Paraffin blocks were cut at 3 µm <lb/>thickness with a microtome and mounted on Superfrost slides. Before staining, <lb/>cryosections were thawed and dried for 30 min under a ventilated hood. Sections were <lb/>re-hydrated with 1x PBS for 5 min. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized by placing them <lb/>for 10 min in xylene (Fluka), and then successively for 1 min each in ethanol 100%, 90%, <lb/>80%, 70% and H2O. <lb/>Alcian blue staining: For alcian blue staining, hydrated sections were stained for 30 min <lb/>in alcian blue (Sigma, ref. 1.01647), acetic acid 3%, pH 2.5. Sections were washed for 2 <lb/>min in running tap water and rinsed in distilled water. Sections were counterstained with <lb/>0.1% nuclear fast red, 5% aluminum sulfate solution (Merck Millipore, ref. 1.00121) for 5 <lb/>min. Sections were washed for 1 min in running tap water and dehydrated. Sections were <lb/>cleared in xylene and mounted with Eukitt (Sigma, ref. 03989) mounting medium. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry: For antigen retrieval, sections were immersed in 10mM Citric <lb/>Acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0 buffer previously heated to 95-100 °C, and incubated for <lb/>20 min. Sections were then cooled down to room temperature in 1x PBS. Section were <lb/>pre-incubated for 30 min with 1x PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% FCS. <lb/>Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (see details in Table S1) diluted in 1x <lb/>PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% FCS over night at 4°C. Sections were washed <lb/>3x15 min with 1x PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated with <lb/>secondary antibodies diluted 1:800 in 1x PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% FCS for 90 <lb/>min at room temperature (see details in Table S2). Sections were again washed 3x 15 <lb/>min with 1x PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Sections were counterstained with DAPI <lb/>(1:5000) for 5 min, rinsed with 1x PBS and mounted with DABCO (Sigma) in glycerol. For <lb/>all tissue samples and all conditions, control samples were processed simultaneously <lb/>without applying primary antibodies. <lb/></div>
