			In order to identify new genes with differential expression in early intestinal tumours, we performed mRNA <lb/>(messenger ribonucleic acid) expression profiling of 16 human and 63 mouse adenomas. All individuals <lb/>had germline APC mutations to ensure that tumorigenesis was driven by &apos;second hits&apos; at APC. Using strin-<lb/>gent filtering to identify changes consistent between humans and mice, we identified 60 genes up-regulated <lb/>and 151 down-regulated in tumours. For 22 selected genes—including known Wnt targets—expression differ-<lb/>ences were confirmed by qRT – PCR (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Most, but <lb/>not all, differences were also present in colorectal carcinomas. In situ analysis showed a complex picture. <lb/>Expression of up-regulated genes in adenomas was usually uniform/diffuse (e.g. ITGA6) or prominent in <lb/>the tumour core (e.g. LGR5); in normal tissue, these genes were expressed at crypt bases or the transit ampli-<lb/>fying zone. Down-regulated genes were often undetectable in adenomas, but in normal tissue were expressed <lb/>in mesenchyme (e.g. GREM1/2) or differentiated cells towards crypt tops (e.g. SGK1). In silico analysis of <lb/>TCF4-binding motifs showed that some of our genes were probably direct Wnt targets. Previous studies, <lb/>mostly focused on human tumours, showed partial overlap with our &apos;expression signature&apos;, but 37 genes <lb/>were unique to our study, including TACSTD2, SEMA3F, HOXA9 and IER3 (up-regulated), and TAGLN, <lb/>GREM1, GREM2, MAB21L2 and RARRES2 (down-regulated). Combined analysis of our and published <lb/>human data identified additional genes differentially expressed in adenomas, including decreased BMPs <lb/>(bone morphogenetic proteins) and increased BUB1/BUB1B. Several of the newly identified, differentially <lb/>expressed genes represent potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for intestinal tumours. <lb/></front>

			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> To the limit of its current resolution, genetic evidence suggests <lb/>that most early colorectal adenomas in humans, and intestinal <lb/>adenomas in the equivalent mouse models, have developed <lb/>solely as a result of bi-allelic inactivation of the APC gene. <lb/>Gene expression changes in these early tumours can therefore <lb/>be taken as candidate Wnt signalling targets, being driven <lb/>directly or indirectly by the increase in beta-catenin-mediated <lb/>signalling that loss of APC function causes. <lb/>The normal intestinal crypt is subject to a gradient of extrinsic <lb/>Wnt signalling, with a maximum at the crypt base where the stem <lb/>cells almost certainly reside, and a minimum at the top of the <lb/>crypt or villus where fully differentiated cells are shed into the <lb/>gut lumen. Three categories of putative Wnt target gene have <lb/>been suggested (1). The first type of gene is expressed primarily <lb/>in the proliferating or transit amplifying cells of the normal crypt, <lb/>and includes established Wnt targets such as MYC. The second <lb/>type of gene—e.g. MMP7 and the cryptdins—is a marker of <lb/>Paneth cell differentiation in the small bowel. The third type of <lb/>gene principally shows expression in the bases of normal intesti-<lb/>nal crypts, perhaps in the crypt stem cells. There are probably <lb/>several reasons for these differences in expression patterns, <lb/>including the actions of other signalling pathways such as the <lb/>Eph/Efn, Bmp and Delta/Notch systems. Although colorectal <lb/>tumours generally show over-expression of Wnt targets, it is <lb/>not clear whether their molecular phenotypes most closely <lb/>resemble normal cells with type 1, 2 or 3 gene expression. <lb/>Understanding the full transcriptional programme of Wnt sig-<lb/>nalling and its downstream effects is important. Proven transcrip-<lb/>tional Wnt targets include MYC, CCND1, CD44 and AXIN2. <lb/> Genes with reduced levels of expression may also be found in <lb/>regions of high physiological Wnt signalling or in colorectal <lb/>tumours. Many of these down-regulated transcripts are likely to <lb/>be genes involved in the functioning of differentiated cells. <lb/>Examples include genes/proteins involved in the absorption of <lb/>nutrients (e.g. lipoprotein lipases and alkaline phosphatases) or <lb/>in instructing cell differentiation (e.g. HATH1 that is involved <lb/>in cell fate direction towards the secretory lineage). <lb/>There has been a handful of previous studies that aimed to <lb/>identify the transcriptional programme driven by Wnt signal-<lb/>ling. Most of these studies have been based on messenger ribo-<lb/>nucleic acid (mRNA) expression microarray analysis. The <lb/>methods and systems used have been very variable, and <lb/>have included inactivation of Wnt in colorectal cancer <lb/>(CRC) cell lines, activation of Wnt in cell lines from normal <lb/>intestinal epithelium and study of colorectal tumours (benign <lb/>and malignant) from humans. Most studies have been <lb/>focused on human tumours. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there <lb/>has been considerable variation between studies in their detec-<lb/>tion of known Wnt targets and in their identification of new <lb/>targets. Thus, despite some notable successes, it has some-<lb/>times proved difficult to distinguish signal from noise. Reichl-<lb/>ing et al. (2) undertook transcriptional profiling of 14 Apc Min <lb/> mouse adenomas and found 114 differentially expressed <lb/>genes, excluding known Wnt targets. When analysis of <lb/>CRCs was added, differential expression of genes such as <lb/> Igfbp5, Lcn2, Ly6d, N4wbp4 (PMEPA1), S100c and Sox4 <lb/> was found. Van der Flier et al. (1) expressed dominant-<lb/>negative TCF4 or TCF1 in CRC cell lines DLD1 and <lb/>LS174T. Changes were confirmed in 32 human adenomas <lb/>and 25 CRCs. Consistently down-regulated genes (putative <lb/>positive Wnt targets) included AXIN2, MYC, ASCL2, LGR5/ <lb/>GPR49, HIG2, BMP4 and SOX4. Kaiser et al. (3) compared <lb/>gene expression profiles in embryonic colon and colorectal <lb/>tumours and found significant resemblances between them. <lb/>Sabates-Bellver et al. (4) undertook transcriptome profiling <lb/>of human colorectal adenomas from 32 patients. After micro-<lb/>enrichment for epithelium, 319 possible positive and negative <lb/>Wnt targets were identified by expression profiling. Of these, <lb/>144 genes displayed significantly altered expression on verifi-<lb/>cation. The KIAA1199 gene was particularly highly expressed <lb/>(60-fold increased). Gaspar et al. (5) studied 42 polyps from <lb/>13 patients (eight APC- and five MYH-mutant) with three <lb/>normal samples for comparison. Duodenal adenomas from <lb/>three Apc 1638N  mice and two wild-type mice were also ana-<lb/>lysed. Approximately 10% of 18 000 genes were differentially <lb/>expressed in humans and, after analysis of the mouse samples, <lb/>a 166-gene signature (100 up, 66 down) was derived, yet this <lb/>included only a few known Wnt targets. Immunohistochemis-<lb/>try was used to validate CD44, ANXA1, CCNA2 and <lb/>MARCKSL1. <lb/>We aimed to identify mRNAs that were consistently differ-<lb/>entially expressed between early adenomas and morphologi-<lb/>cally normal tissue from both humans and mice. We <lb/>therefore collected a much larger sample of mouse tumours <lb/>for analysis than previous studies had done. In order to <lb/>utilize a relatively homogeneous system and to ensure that <lb/>tumorigenesis was driven by &apos;second hits&apos; at APC, we <lb/>focused on individuals with known germline APC mutations, <lb/>either humans with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or <lb/>mice with the Apc Min(R850X)  mutation. Adenomas were early <lb/>lesions (,5 mm diameter, tubular morphology, mildly dys-<lb/>plastic), and a small number of sporadic human CRCs was <lb/>analysed alongside them. Using stringent criteria, we ident-<lb/>ified a number of genes that are differentially expressed in <lb/>early colorectal tumours and represent strong candidates as <lb/>direct or indirect targets of Wnt signalling. We discuss these <lb/>data in the light of previous studies. <lb/> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/> Expression profiling and verification <lb/> Using a stringent significance threshold of P , 0.005 after <lb/>Benjamini– Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction, <lb/>we identified 220 genes that were significantly up-regulated <lb/>and 548 that were significantly down-regulated by at least <lb/>2-fold when comparing normal tissue and large-bowel adeno-<lb/>mas from human FAP patients. If multiple probes from one <lb/>gene were present on the array, we scored that gene as differ-<lb/>entially expressed if any probe fulfilled our criteria, although <lb/>in no case were two different probes from the same gene sig-<lb/>nificantly altered in opposite directions. The 768 genes are <lb/>shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1. The list included <lb/>several genes that have been described as direct or indirect <lb/>targets of Wnt signalling, including CCND1, CD44, CLU, <lb/>EPH receptors, LGR5/GPR49, MMP7, MYC and SFRP1. <lb/> Absent from the list, because they were not significantly <lb/>differentially expressed, were known Wnt targets such as <lb/>

			AXIN, conductin (AXIN2) and c-Jun. The most strongly <lb/>up-regulated gene was CDH3 (P-cadherin), which was over-<lb/>expressed 35-fold. <lb/> We then compared the list of human genes with genes that <lb/>passed the same thresholds in three series of large and small <lb/>bowel adenomas from Min mice on the C57BL/6J background <lb/>(see Materials and Methods). In line with our stringent selec-<lb/>tion process, initial filtering required .95% of all mouse <lb/>probes from all three series of polyps to show changes in <lb/>the same direction as the human changes. Evidently, this strat-<lb/>egy will have excluded some genuine direct or indirect Wnt <lb/>targets, especially those-specific to each species or to different <lb/>regions of the bowel, or those with sub-optimal probes on the <lb/>arrays. Other genes, such as CD44, showed 10% of discor-<lb/>dant probes, presumably as a result of isoform-specific <lb/>expression in the two species. TCF4 and CLU (clusterin) <lb/>showed an unusual pattern, with universal up-regulation in <lb/>mice, but down-regulation in all human tumours. <lb/>We then excluded all genes for which no mouse probe <lb/>showed significantly changed expression at P , 0.005. In <lb/>practice, this selection largely excluded genes with few <lb/>probes on the arrays and for which there was consequently <lb/>low confidence in the expression changes being consistent in <lb/>humans and mice. This reduced the list to a &apos;gene expression <lb/>signature&apos; of 60 up-regulated and 151 down-regulated genes <lb/>(Table 1). This gene set included the up-regulated targets <lb/> CCND1, EPHB2, EPHB3, LGR5, MMP7 and MYC and the <lb/>down-regulated SFRP1. The most up-regulated gene was <lb/> TACSTD2 (18-fold in humans, 82-fold in mouse) and the <lb/>most down-regulated were CCL19 (25-fold in humans) and <lb/> Cnn1 (33-fold in mouse). The genes performed no evident <lb/>common function (apart from being in the Wnt pathway in <lb/>some cases), although some related genes were present in <lb/>the list, an example being GREM1 and GREM2. <lb/> In order to validate the expression array data, we then selected <lb/>for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction <lb/>(qRT–PCR) analysis a mixture of 22 differentially expressed <lb/>genes showing up-or down-regulation (described later), includ-<lb/>ing some known Wnt targets and some potentially novel <lb/>targets. These genes were studied in additional sets of up to 19 <lb/>FAP large bowel adenomas, seven sporadic human CRCs, 14 <lb/>Min mouse small bowel adenomas, and 19 Min mouse large <lb/>bowel adenomas. Actual sample numbers studied for each gene <lb/>varied according to the quantity of mRNA extracted from each <lb/>lesion (see Materials and Methods). Pre hoc, our criteria were <lb/>to reject any gene for which any of the sample sets showed an <lb/>expression change in the opposite direction to that found by <lb/>microarray analysis and also to exclude any gene that did not <lb/>show a significant expression difference (at P , 0.05 to reflect <lb/>fewer tests) in any sample type. In practice, almost all genes <lb/>passed these thresholds. We successfully validated the array <lb/>data for the following up-regulated genes: MMP7, LGR5, <lb/>MYC, CCND1, ITGA6, PHLDA1, CXCL3, IER3, TGIF, <lb/>SEMA3F, SOX4, TACSTD2 and HOXA9. However, ETS2 was <lb/>only over-expressed in adenomas, and actually significantly <lb/>under-expressed in two of the three CRCs investigated. For <lb/>down-regulated genes, we validated under-expression of SGK1, <lb/>GNA11, SFRP1, RARRES2, HPGD and MAB21L2. However, <lb/>whilst GREM1 and GREM2 were under-expressed in adenomas, <lb/>these two genes showed increased expression in CRCs. In <lb/>summary, all targets were successfully verified in adenomas, <lb/>but in a small number of cases, gene expression levels changed <lb/>on progression to carcinoma. <lb/> In situ analysis of gene expression <lb/> We then undertook in situ hybridization (ISH) of mRNAs using <lb/>normal intestinal epithelium and adenomas from FAP patients <lb/>and Min mice, in order to determine the topographical <lb/>expression patterns of a subset of the consistently changed <lb/>genes. Although it is difficult to make truly quantitative com-<lb/>parisons between gene expression levels using ISH, it is possible <lb/>to make semi-quantitative comparisons using the beta-actin <lb/>control probe, to assess the gradient of expression of any gene <lb/>along the crypt axis, and to assess the cell types in which <lb/>genes are principally expressed. In some cases, expression <lb/>levels were low and reliable ISH data could not be obtained. <lb/>However, clear results were obtained in the following cases. <lb/>We first analysed some established Wnt targets. MYC and <lb/> EPHB2 were strongly expressed in the transit amplifying <lb/>zone of normal crypts (type 1 genes), and throughout the epi-<lb/>thelium of adenomas. MMP7 was strongly expressed only at <lb/>the bases of normal crypts, but strongly or moderately diffu-<lb/>sely in adenoma epithelium; expression appeared to be par-<lb/>ticularly strong in Paneth cells, but was not restricted to this <lb/>lineage and MMP7 could therefore be classed as of mixed <lb/>type 2/3. CD44 was moderately/strongly expressed at the <lb/>crypt bases (and in villus cores of normal small bowel epi-<lb/>thelium), and strongly in adenomas (type 3). CCND1 <lb/>(assessed using immunohistochemistry) was principally <lb/>expressed in the transit amplifying zone of normal crypts <lb/>and widely in adenomas, with the strongest expression near <lb/>the crypt tops. <lb/> LGR5 encodes an orphan G-protein coupled receptor and <lb/>was originally identified as a Wnt target in CRC cell lines. <lb/>It was shown to be up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas <lb/>carrying beta-catenin mutations (6) and in colorectal and <lb/>ovarian tumours (7). It has been reported as being expressed-<lb/>specifically in crypt base columnar (CBC) cells, between the <lb/>Paneth cells, by Barker et al. (8). On this basis, coupled <lb/>with lineage tracing, LGR5 has been proposed as a crypt <lb/>stem (or progenitor) cell marker. We too found LGR5 to be <lb/>a type 3 gene, with expression restricted to the crypt bases, <lb/>especially the CBC cells, in both large and small bowel. In <lb/>adenomas, LGR5 was generally present in patches of variable <lb/>size that comprised about two-thirds of the total area of the <lb/>lesion (Fig. 1A), more extensive than reported by Barker <lb/> et al. (8). In general, these areas were close to the adenoma <lb/>core, consistent with retention of some normal crypt hierarchy, <lb/>some differentiation towards the surface of early adenomas, <lb/>and a &apos;bottom-up&apos; model of adenoma pathogenesis. <lb/> SGK1 encodes a kinase involved in the control of ion trans-<lb/>port. It was expressed at the tops of normal crypts (Fig. 1B) <lb/>and on villi, but was absent from all adenomas and carci-<lb/>nomas. Naishiro et al. (9) had found decreased expression of <lb/> SGK1 mRNA in a rat intestinal epithelial cell line that <lb/>expressed a stable form of beta-catenin. Immunohistochemis-<lb/>try by Naishiro et al. (9) did not confirm the mRNA expression <lb/>data, but in our hands, SGK1 antibodies have proved unsuita-<lb/>ble for use in fixed material. Interestingly, SGK1 expression <lb/>

			has actually been reported as being increased in other cancer <lb/>types (10,11) and recently, Dehner et al. (12) found SGK1 to <lb/>be up-regulated in the CRC cell line HCT116 when Wnt sig-<lb/>nalling was increased by knock-down of APC. However, we <lb/>have found that SGK1 expression in colorectal carcinomas is <lb/>very low, consistent with its role in ion transport which <lb/>suggests that higher expression is expected at the top of the <lb/>crypt and on the villus. Intestinal stem cells, adenomas and <lb/>CRCs would not be expected to express SGK1, consistent <lb/>with our data. <lb/> GNA11 is a G-protein of essentially uncertain function in <lb/>the gut. It is probably involved in transmembrane signalling <lb/>and may act as an activator of phospholipase C. Down-<lb/>regulation of the gene has been demonstrated in breast <lb/>cancers (13). GNA11 showed moderate expression in normal <lb/>epithelium, without any clear gradient or obvious restriction <lb/>of expression. Expression was universally down-regulated in <lb/>adenomas (Fig. 1C). <lb/> ETS2 is a transcription factor that recognizes the core con-<lb/>sensus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence GGAA/T <lb/>upstream of target genes. ETS2 was expressed at the base <lb/>and in the lower third of the transit amplifying zone of <lb/>normal crypts. Adenomas investigated by ISH showed gener-<lb/>ally increased expression, with a subtle falling-off of levels <lb/>towards the tops of crypts (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, Sussan <lb/> et al. (14) showed that trisomy 21 repressed intestinal tumori-<lb/>genesis largely through ETS2 over-expression. In line with this <lb/>effect, ETS2 may play a role in promoting apoptosis (15), and <lb/>intestinal adenomas exhibit increased rates of apoptosis (our <lb/>unpublished data). ETS2 is over-expressed in several types <lb/>of cancer, although out of the three sporadic colorectal <lb/>carcinomas we investigated by qRT–PCR, only one showed <lb/>3.5-fold up-regulation of the gene, while the other two <lb/>showed decreased expression (1.6 and 9.0-fold respectively), <lb/>suggesting that its functional effects may be context-dependent. <lb/> GREM1 and GREM2 were expressed at relatively low levels <lb/>in the sub-epithelial myofibroblasts and muscularis mucosa of <lb/>the normal intestinal epithelium. Expression was not detect-<lb/>able in adenomas. These proteins are secreted bone morpho-<lb/>genetic protein (BMP) antagonists that are 55% identical to <lb/>each other within a 173 amino acid core. An SNP near <lb/> GREM1 is associated with increased risk of CRC in humans <lb/>(16). The pattern of Gremlin expression in normal tissue <lb/>(Fig. 1E) partially resembles that detected previously by <lb/>Kosinski et al. (17) who compared gene expression in the <lb/>tops and bottoms of crypts. It is also strongly suggestive of <lb/>a BMP gradient along the crypt, with levels highest at the <lb/>top and lowest near the stem cells at the bottom. However, <lb/>we and others (18,19) have found increased Gremlin <lb/>expression in cancers, apparently at odds with decreased <lb/>expression in our adenomas. It is possible that these obser-<lb/>vations reflect a decreased ratio of muscularis mucosa to epi-<lb/>thelium in benign lesions, but a tendency for malignancies to <lb/>acquire their own Gremlin expression—and perhaps a <lb/>mesenchyme-like phenotype—in order to maintain a stem <lb/>cell-like state independent of the surrounding tissues. <lb/> ITGA6 is a member of the integrin alpha subunit family <lb/>involved in cell adhesion and signalling. Up-regulation of <lb/>the gene has been identified in oesophageal adenocarcinomas <lb/>(20) and was found to be necessary for survival of a highly <lb/>tumorigenic sub-population of breast cancer cells, through <lb/>roles in adhesion and/or signalling (21).

			expression was essentially absent in normal intestine, but there <lb/>was strong up-regulation throughout adenomatous epithelium <lb/>(Fig. 1F). <lb/> RARRES2 showed an unusual change between normal tissue <lb/>and adenomas. In the normal crypt, expression was concen-<lb/>trated around the base (Fig. 1G). Although there was a net <lb/>decrease in RARRES2 expression in adenomas, it became <lb/>more widespread, involving the whole epithelium at a low <lb/>level (Fig. 1H). RARRES2 is a retinoic acid receptor, although <lb/>its function is poorly described. <lb/> Comparison and pooled analysis with other studies <lb/> We compared our data with those of three relatively large <lb/>studies that have been published (1,4,5), although one of <lb/>these studies (1) only reported genes that were up-regulated <lb/>when Wnt was activated. Of our 60 þ 151 &apos;gene signature&apos;, <lb/>19% of genes were present in the Gaspar data set (1859 <lb/>genes with FDR , 0.005), 18% in the van der Flier data set <lb/>(160 up-regulated genes with FDR , 0.05) and 14% in the <lb/>Sabates-Bellver data (genes with .4-fold expression differ-<lb/>ence and FDR , 0.01). By way of comparison, 16% of the <lb/>genes reported by van der Flier et al. were also present in <lb/>the list of Gaspar et al. The following up-regulated genes <lb/>were present in our list and at least two of the other lists: <lb/> GPR49/LGR5, EPHB3, PHLDA1, SOX4 and ETS2. A further <lb/>17 up-regulated genes, including MYC and CCND1, were <lb/>present in our list and in one other list. For our down-regulated <lb/>genes, 44 (including GNA11 and SGK1) were present in at <lb/>least one of the other two studies, and seven (MYLK, <lb/> SFRP1, IL6R, HPGD, MGC4172, NR5A2 and SLC26A2) <lb/> were listed in all three studies. Thirty-seven genes were <lb/>unique to our list, including the following that were confirmed <lb/>by qRT – PCR: TACSTD2, SEMA3F, HOXA9 and IER3 (all <lb/>up), and TAGLN, GREM1, GREM2, MAB21L2 and <lb/> RARRES2 (all down). <lb/> Figure 1.

			Since our sequential filtering strategy favours-specificity at <lb/>potentially great cost in sensitivity, we also undertook a <lb/>pooled analysis of our human data and the publicly available <lb/>results of Sabates-Bellver et al. (4) who used an Affymetrix <lb/>platform which was compatible with our analysis. A combined <lb/>analysis of our data from human FAP adenomas with those of <lb/>Sabates-Bellver was performed, with the caveat that APC <lb/> mutation status was not characterized in the Sabates-Bellver <lb/>sample set. The 1676 genes with a .2-fold difference in <lb/>expression, using a FDR threshold of 0.001 and after correc-<lb/>tion for variation between experiments, are shown in Sup-<lb/>plementary Material, Table S3. The combined analysis <lb/>confirmed most of the putative Wnt targets reported in this <lb/>study and previously. In addition, the following targets were <lb/>of note and were supported in both studies. CDH3, highly <lb/>expressed in our human data but not universally so in mouse <lb/>tumours and not reported in all other studies, was strongly sup-<lb/>ported by the combined analysis. Similarly, KIAA1199 <lb/> reported as a possible Wnt target by Sabates-Bellver et al., <lb/> was also over-expressed in our study and supported by the <lb/>combined analysis. BMP expression, with the exception of <lb/> BMP4, was generally decreased, despite the decrease in <lb/>expression of the BMP antagonists GREM1 and GREM2. <lb/> This may favour a stem cell phenotype, but appears to be a <lb/>paradoxical result, and may be secondary to changes in the <lb/>Gremlins. Hypoxia pathway components, such as carbonic <lb/>anhydrases, were also generally decreased. Other previously <lb/>unreported, but potentially interesting targets included the <lb/>spindle assembly checkpoint genes BUB1 and BUB1B, <lb/> which were over-expressed; given that APC has a proposed <lb/>(though controversial) role in chromosomal instability <lb/>through chromosome mis-segregation, it is possible that <lb/>BUB1/BUB1B are over-expressed in response to mitotic <lb/>checkpoint activation (22). <lb/> Differential expression and TCF-binding <lb/> In order to test whether some of our differentially expressed <lb/>genes were direct Wnt targets, we searched using Fuzznuc <lb/>from Emboss for the presence of putative TCF4-binding <lb/>sites (WWCAAWG) in the 10 kb upstream of the translation <lb/>start site of each transcript in humans (data from https:// <lb/>www.ensembl.org/). We examined whether genes with signifi-<lb/>cant expression differences in human tumours tended to have <lb/>more upstream TCF4 sequences than genes without such <lb/>differences.-specifically, in a logistic regression analysis, we <lb/>set as the dependent variable whether a gene was significantly <lb/>differentially expressed and used as independent variables: (i) <lb/>distance from the translation start site in 500 bp bins, (ii) mean <lb/>number of TCF4-binding motifs in each bin over all genes, <lb/>and (iii) local GC content in that bin. The mean number of <lb/>TCF4 sequences was significantly higher (P ¼ 0.001) for <lb/>significantly differentially expressed genes (mean ¼ 0.68 per <lb/>gene) than other genes (mean ¼ 0.62), even after stratifying <lb/>for local GC content. There was overall no effect of distance <lb/>from translation start site on motif frequency, although it <lb/>was notable that the first 500 bp upstream, which was <lb/>GC-rich and hence least likely to have TCF4-binding motifs <lb/>that occurred by chance, showed the highest difference <lb/>between significantly and non-significantly differentially <lb/>expressed genes (means 0.46 and 0.39 binding sites per gene <lb/>respectively, P , 0.0001, Wilcoxon test). <lb/>We tested whether some-specific members of our Wnt <lb/>&apos;signature&apos; were likely to be direct targets. We used the <lb/>CRC cell line RKO in which Wnt signalling is not active <lb/>and, owing to reported issues of toxicity if beta-catenin is <lb/>over-expressed in these cells, we activated Wnt signalling <lb/>using LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3-beta. New protein synthesis <lb/>was inhibited using cycloheximide. We found that GREM1 <lb/> and GREM2 were already expressed at very low levels prior <lb/>to Wnt activation, consistent with their origins from <lb/>non-epithelial cells. LGR5 showed 2.1-fold increased <lb/>expression, consistent with it being a direct positive Wnt <lb/>target. However, all of the other genes tested (CXCL3, <lb/> ETS2, GNA11, ITGA6, PHLDA1, SEMA3F, SGK1, <lb/>TACSTD2) showed less than the conventional threshold of <lb/>1.5-fold change in mRNA levels, suggesting that they are <lb/>not direct positive or negative Wnt targets. <lb/>We then determined whether our &apos;Wnt signature&apos; genes had <lb/>been detected as possible targets of TCF4/beta-catenin binding <lb/>using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in the study of <lb/>Hatzis et al. (23). We examined the top 2148 genes reported <lb/>by Hatzis et al., containing a total of 6868 high-confidence <lb/>binding sites. Of the 21 most strongly over-expressed genes <lb/>in our human tumours (Table 1), 11 had high-confidence <lb/>TCF4 -binding sites (TACSTD2, DUSP4, GDF15, CXCL3, <lb/>SLC12A2, ITGA6, EPHB3, EPHB2, SEMA3F, PHLDA1 and <lb/> ETS2). In all, 16/60 over-expressed genes, but only 18/151 <lb/>under-expressed genes, were associated with binding sites <lb/>(P ¼ 0.0086, x  2 <lb/>1 <lb/> test). Whilst the possibility of direct negative <lb/>Wnt targets cannot be excluded, this result confirms that Wnt <lb/>activation generally leads to increased direct target expression. <lb/>It also suggests that some positive Wnt target genes—such as <lb/> TACSTD2 and SEMA3F, which were not over-expressed when <lb/>we activated Wnt in the absence of new protein synthesis— <lb/>may contain TCF4-binding sites that are not involved in <lb/>causing increased gene expression in vivo. <lb/> Concluding remarks <lb/> Using high-stringency filtering, we have identified a set of 60 <lb/>up-regulated and 151 down-regulated genes that show consist-<lb/>ent expression differences between intestinal adenomas and <lb/>normal tissue from humans and mice. This list includes <lb/>known Wnt targets. The remaining &apos;novel&apos; genes are potential <lb/>Wnt targets, mostly of the indirect type, but many are likely to <lb/>be indirectly influenced by Wnt or by the cellular composition <lb/>of adenomas compared with normal epithelium. All genes <lb/>tested that were differentially expressed by microarray analy-<lb/>sis were confirmed by qRT – PCR. However, ISH showed that <lb/>the actual localization of the differentially expressed mRNAs <lb/>was highly variable. In situ analysis is therefore very import-<lb/>ant when examining genes with differential expression in early <lb/>intestinal tumours. <lb/>It is notable that the several studies to identify putative Wnt <lb/>targets using mRNA expression analysis in colorectal tumours <lb/>have found only limited overlap. Inevitably, some &apos;targets&apos; are <lb/>false-positives, but the differences also reflect the use of <lb/>different samples and mechanisms of Wnt activation, and <lb/>different methods of analysis. For example, we deliberately <lb/>

			excluded some differentially expressed genes for which <lb/>mRNA splicing appeared to be altered between normal and <lb/>tumour tissues, since comparison between the levels of these <lb/>genes is extremely difficult. Overall, our study seems compar-<lb/>able with the three other most similar studies in the field <lb/>(1,4,5) in that there was considerable, but incomplete, <lb/>overlap for a core set of 20– 30 genes that are generally <lb/>accepted as differentially expressed under Wnt-ON and <lb/>Wnt-OFF conditions. Many other real targets were probably <lb/>present in our list, the stringency of our filtering being <lb/>reflected in the fact that only 37 of our 215 differentially <lb/>expressed genes were not detected by any of the other three <lb/>studies. This assertion was confirmed by our pooled analysis <lb/>with the Sabates-Bellver data (4), in which ,25% of the <lb/>genes in our 60 þ 151 &apos;gene signature&apos; genes were rendered <lb/>absent from the combined data using a filter of FDR , 0.001. <lb/>In summary, the identification of genes with expression <lb/>changes in early colorectal adenomas helps to identify the <lb/>mechanisms of colorectal tumorigenesis and to provide poten-<lb/>tial targets for prevention and therapy. It is essential that a <lb/>multi-stage approach is taken to this work, both for validation <lb/>and so that different strands of evidence can be incorporated, <lb/>including expression profiling and the discovery of TCF4/ <lb/>beta-catenin-binding sites. In this study, we have reported <lb/>our own expression profiling data and some new early and <lb/>consistent changes in human and mouse intestinal adenomas. <lb/>We have also undertaken comparative and pooled analyses <lb/>that between them have enabled us to propose new direct or <lb/>indirect Wnt targets with some confidence. Several of the <lb/>newly identified, differentially expressed genes represent <lb/>potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for intestinal <lb/>tumours. <lb/> MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/> Microarray expression analysis <lb/> Initially, three &apos;classical&apos; FAP patients carrying germline <lb/>mutations (Q163X, S1190X and delATnt2396) in the APC <lb/> gene were identified. Sixteen snap-frozen adenomas (all with <lb/>previously characterized somatic APC mutations) were col-<lb/>lected from these patients; all lesions were mildly dysplastic <lb/>adenomas of ,0.5 cm diameter derived from different sites <lb/>within the large bowel. Eight snap-frozen samples of normal <lb/>bowel were collected from the same three patients and two <lb/>additional FAP cases. mRNA was extracted from each <lb/>sample with the GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep <lb/>kit (Sigma, RTN70) All subsequent steps in the microarray <lb/>expression analysis were carried out by the Cancer Research <lb/>UK GeneChip Microarray Service. Briefly, after quality <lb/>control, the RNAs were reverse-transcribed to double stranded <lb/>complementary DNA (cDNAs) and biotin-labelled comp-<lb/>lementary RNA (cRNA) was amplified by in vitro transcrip-<lb/>tion with T7 RNA polymerase. cRNAs were then hybridized <lb/>to HGU133A Affymetrix Chips. Full protocols are available <lb/>at http://bioinformatics.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/protocols.jsp <lb/>For Apc Min/þ  (Min) mice, three series of small-or large-<lb/>bowel adenomas and normal intestinal epithelium were <lb/>studied. All samples were removed at autopsy and snap-<lb/>frozen. For series 1, mRNA was extracted and cRNA prepared <lb/>from 24 small-bowel adenomas and 24 normal samples from <lb/>six mice as described earlier; samples from each mouse <lb/>were pooled, before hybridization to 12 Affymetrix <lb/>MOE430_2 arrays using the manufacturer&apos;s protocols. For <lb/>series 2, tissue was homogenized using the FastRNA Kit <lb/>(Q-Biogene) and total RNA prepared using the RNEasy kit <lb/>(Qiagen). RNAs from up to five tumours or normal epithelium <lb/>from eight individual mice were pooled before hybridization <lb/>to the Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 arrays using the manufac-<lb/>turer&apos;s protocols; this resulted in the following pools being <lb/>analysed – two tumours and two normal from the large <lb/>bowel, and four tumours and two normal from the small <lb/>bowel. For series 3, samples were prepared as for series 1; <lb/>RNAs from nine small bowel adenomas and from six <lb/>normal epithelial samples were each hybridized to Affymetrix <lb/>MOE430_2 arrays. <lb/> Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase <lb/>chain reaction <lb/> In order to provide further evidence of the changes identified <lb/>by expression microarrays, mRNA was extracted from snap-<lb/>frozen human FAP samples (on average, eight normal <lb/>samples, 10 adenoma samples and four colorectal carcinoma <lb/>samples were investigated for each gene) and Apc Min/þ <lb/> mouse samples (on average, 32 normal and 29 tumour <lb/>samples) with GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep kit <lb/>(Sigma, RTN70) and converted to cDNA with First Strand <lb/>cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham biosciences) according to <lb/>the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. cDNAs were purified using the <lb/>QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28104) and 30 ng of <lb/>cDNA were used for each reaction. TaqMan Gene Expression <lb/>Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used for each gene of inter-<lb/>est. Details are available from the authors on request. Absolute <lb/>quantification qRT –PCR was performed on the ABI 7900HT <lb/>(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instruc-<lb/>tions and data were analysed with the comparative Ct method <lb/>(with GAPDH serving as endogenous Control) as described in <lb/>Applied Biosystems&apos;s User Bulletin No. 2. <lb/>For analysis of target mRNA expression in RKO, cells were <lb/>seeded and left to grow to 80% confluence. The cells were <lb/>then treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide <lb/>(60 ug/ml, Sigma) for 2 h, before addition of 20 mM LiCl (test) <lb/>or KCl (Control). No-treatment and cycloheximide-only <lb/>samples were also analysed. The cells were incubated for <lb/>24 h and RNAs were then extracted from pelleted cells <lb/>using the GenElute total mammalian RNA kit (RTN-70, <lb/>Sigma). RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the <lb/>AffinityScript TM QPCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene), <lb/>according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. cDNAs were puri-<lb/>fied using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and <lb/>used (30 ng per reaction) to assess expression of the putative <lb/>Wnt target genes CXCL3, ETS2, GNA11, GREM1, GREM2, <lb/>ITGA6, LGR5, PHLDA1, RARRES2, SEMA3F, SGK1 and <lb/> TACSTD2 with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (details <lb/>available on request), according to manufacturer&apos;s protocol. <lb/>Each sample was run in duplicate and the data obtained <lb/>were analysed using the comparative Ct method (as described <lb/>in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin No. 2), using GAPDH as <lb/>an endogenous Control and comparing LiCl-with KCl-treated <lb/>

			cells. The fold change in mRNA expression levels was calcu-<lb/>lated as 2  2ddCt  . <lb/> In situ hybridization <lb/> Isotopic ISH was performed essentially as previously described <lb/>(24) on the following genes: MYC, EPHB2, MMP7, CD44, <lb/>GPR49/LGR5, SGK1, GNA11, ETS2, GREM2, ITGA6 and <lb/> RARRES2. Briefly, templates for riboprobe synthesis were gen-<lb/>erated by amplifying from cDNA PCR products of 500 bp, <lb/>spanning exon – exon boundaries, and cloning them into the <lb/>vector pGEM3Z. All templates were sequenced prior to ribop-<lb/>robe synthesis. Details of primers used and correspondence <lb/>between ISH probes and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays <lb/>are shown in Supplementary Material, Table S3. Riboprobes <lb/>were generated by in vitro transcription using the RNA poly-<lb/>merase Sp6 and hybridized to 4 mm sections, cut from eight <lb/>formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. A beta-actin <lb/>probe was generated and used as a hybridization control. <lb/> Data analysis <lb/> Raw gene expression data were imported into the GeneSpring <lb/>program and the Mas5 algorithm was used to average across <lb/>the different probes per gene present in each array. Data for <lb/>each chip were normalized by median-centering (i.e. to the <lb/>median of all values on a given array). Data were included <lb/>if a probeset was present in at least one sample probe set <lb/>per data series. Differential expression was defined as exceed-<lb/>ing a specified fold change in either direction with a specified <lb/>degree of confidence; in general, higher fold-changes and <lb/>lower P-values or FDRs were specified for the initial screens <lb/>than for the verification experiments. For meta-analysis of <lb/>our own data and those of others, signal intensity estimates <lb/>for the extra data sets were Mas5 generated and the data <lb/>median centred as for our own human data set. Since both <lb/>data sets were from Affymetrix arrays, probesets with identi-<lb/>cal IDs were identified and analysed. Tumour and experiment <lb/>effect variance was modelled using ANOVA. Differential <lb/>probe sets between the adenoma and normal cases were <lb/>identified using a 0.001 FDR correcting for any experiment <lb/>effect across the samples. The analysis was carried out using <lb/>the Limma and Affy packages from Bioconductor 2.2 within <lb/>R 2.7.0. <lb/>
