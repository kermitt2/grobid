			<body> Introduction <lb/> Enablement is an intervention by which the health care provider <lb/>recognizes, promotes and enhances people&apos;s ability to control their <lb/>health and life [1–4]. St-Cyr Tribble et al. propose, in accordance <lb/>with recent reviews on the topic [1–4], a model of enablement <lb/>regrouping the following dimensions: contributing to the therapeu-<lb/>tic relationship, building on the person&apos;s point of view, facilitating <lb/>the learning experience, encouraging and supporting the decision-<lb/>making process, building on the person&apos;s strengths and helping to <lb/>broaden the person&apos;s possibilities [3]. <lb/>Enablement is in continuity with the patient-centred model <lb/>[5,6] because it shares many dimensions with this last model <lb/>(contributing to the therapeutic relationship, building on the per-<lb/>son&apos;s point of view, encouraging and supporting the decision-<lb/>making process and facilitating the learning experience). The term <lb/>&apos;empowerment&apos; is often used to talk about enablement [7–10]. <lb/>However, this term (empowerment) may be confusing because it <lb/>can also represent the patient&apos;s outcome after the enablement <lb/>intervention [2,4,11]. <lb/>Abundant health literature suggests that strategies based on <lb/>enablement are associated with good outcomes [12], which <lb/>include a more effective decision-making process, a better man-<lb/>agement of disease complications and adoption of healthier behav-<lb/>iours [13]. However, despite these potential relevant outcomes, <lb/>the World Health Organization stressed the lack of patients&apos; <lb/></body>

			<body> enablement by health care providers in the long-term care of <lb/>chronic diseases [12]. A primary step in developing and evaluating <lb/>strategies to improve enablement is to have a reliable and valid <lb/>measure of enablement in the health care context. As our capacity <lb/>to measure it grows, we will be in a better position to estimate the <lb/>real effects of enablement on patients&apos; health, and more broadly, <lb/>on the health care system [14]. We could also be able to design <lb/>effective strategies to improve enablement. <lb/>In this study, we aimed at identifying and comparing instru-<lb/>ments used to assess enablement in the health care context. <lb/> Methods <lb/> Search strategy and articles selection <lb/> Covering all available years from 1980 to March 2009, we con-<lb/>ducted an electronic literature search of the following databases: <lb/>Medline (1980–), Embase (1980–), Cochrane (1991–), Cinahl <lb/>(1982–) and PsycINFO (1980–), without any language restriction. <lb/>An information specialist was consulted to help develop, update <lb/>and run specific strategies for each databases. The following <lb/>MeSH terms and keywords were used: &apos;Power (psychology)&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Empowerment&apos;, &apos;Empowering&apos;, &apos;Enablement&apos;, &apos;Questionnaires&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Process assessment&apos;, &apos;Quality assessment&apos;, &apos;Psychometrics&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Scale&apos;, &apos;Instrument construction&apos;, &apos;Instrument validation&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Instrument scaling&apos;, &apos;Validation studies&apos;, &apos;Nursing assessment&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Reliability&apos;, &apos;Validity&apos;, &apos;Test validity&apos;, &apos;Test reliability&apos;, &apos;Test <lb/>construction&apos;, &apos;Factor analysis&apos;, &apos;Rating scale&apos;, &apos;Instrument&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Measurement&apos;, &apos;Assessment&apos;, &apos;Tool&apos;, &apos;Health Care Services&apos;, <lb/>&apos;Continuum of Care&apos;, &apos;Long Term Care&apos;, &apos;Mental Health Ser-<lb/>vices&apos;, &apos;Palliative Care&apos;, &apos;Primary Health Care&apos;. We also examined <lb/>additional relevant articles that potentially included an eligible <lb/>instrument from the reference lists of the collected articles (hand <lb/>searching). <lb/>All searches were transferred to a reference database (Ref-<lb/>works). Refworks gave the opportunity to group similar (not nec-<lb/>essarily identical) citations. Similar citations were then checked to <lb/>remove manually the identical ones (citations indexed on more <lb/>than one database). The titles and abstracts were read one by one <lb/>(CH). We excluded the citation at this stage if it was obvious that <lb/>it did not satisfy our inclusion criteria. We retained other citations <lb/>for complete reading. Two authors (CH and JA) independently <lb/>appraised the full text of identified retained papers to identify <lb/>potentially eligible articles. Discrepancies between the two <lb/>reviewers were resolved by consensus. First authors of included <lb/>studies were contacted to identify uncovered articles. <lb/> Inclusion and exclusion criteria <lb/> Citations were retained if they satisfied all of the following criteria: <lb/>(1) development and/or validation of an instrument; (2) evaluation <lb/>of enablement (often called &apos;empowerment&apos;) defined as an inter-<lb/>vention by which the health care provider recognizes, promotes <lb/>and enhances patients&apos; abilities to control their health and lives; <lb/>and (3) quantitative results following administration of the instru-<lb/>ment. We did not search for articles measuring only a sub-concept <lb/>or a dimension of enablement (patient-centred care, shared deci-<lb/>sion making, participation and information, etc.). Articles includ-<lb/>ing only a subscale on enablement were not retained. <lb/> Assessment of study quality <lb/> We assessed the quality of the first article published (considered as <lb/>the main article) for each instruments selected, using a modified <lb/>version of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy <lb/>(STARD) [15–17]. The STARD is an outgrowth of the Consoli-<lb/>dated Standards of Reporting Trials initiative [18], adopted by <lb/>many of the leading biomedical journals and journals in psychol-<lb/>ogy [19]. The STARD has already been successfully used in a <lb/>similar systematic review by a member of our team (F. L.) [20]. <lb/>From the initial STARD that contained 25 items [15–17], 15 items <lb/>were kept and judged appropriate to evaluate questionnaires. <lb/>Using this modified scale (15 items), two researchers (CH and JA) <lb/>independently determined a global quality score for each article. <lb/>The scores were then compared and a consensus was reached. <lb/> Data extraction <lb/> The following data were extracted for each instrument included: <lb/>[21] name of the instrument as given by the original author, first <lb/>author of the instrument and year of publication, discipline of the <lb/>first author, main purpose (measurement aim, clinical domain and <lb/>context of use envisioned by author, including the person who <lb/>completed the instrument), description of the instrument (number <lb/>of dimensions and items), response scale, development proce-<lb/>dures, conceptual/theoretical foundation and psychometric prop-<lb/>erties. Special attention was given to face and content validity [19]. <lb/>Face validity indicates whether the instrument appears to be <lb/>assessing the construct of interest. Content validity is the extent to <lb/>which all dimensions of the measured concept are represented <lb/>in the instrument [19]. Data extraction was completed by two <lb/>members of the team (CH and JA) and disagreements were <lb/>resolved by consensus. <lb/> Results <lb/> Articles included <lb/> Figure 1 shows the number of citations found at each stage of the <lb/>selection process. The search strategies identified 3800 citations, <lb/>from which 3135 were kept after removing duplicates. Fifty-three <lb/>were read completely and evaluated. Among these articles, eight <lb/>were not about the development or validation of an instrument <lb/>[22–29]; six were about concepts other than enablement or <lb/>empowerment [30–35], 31 did not measure a professional inter-<lb/>vention [36–66] and five included only a subscale on enablement <lb/>[67–71]. Hand searching and correspondence with authors added <lb/>another relevant article [72]. <lb/>Four articles covering two instruments were included in this <lb/>review. The identified instruments were: the Patient Empowerment <lb/>Scale (PES) [72,73] and the Empowering Speech Practices Scale <lb/>(ESPS) [74,75]. <lb/> Quality assessment <lb/> Overall, the quality of the studies was fair: 8 and 9 out of 15 <lb/>(Table 1). <lb/></body>

			<body> Characteristics of instruments <lb/> Tables 2 and 3 summarize both included instruments. Both instru-<lb/>ments (PES and ESPS) were based on conceptual frameworks <lb/>developed from studies conducted by the same authors (as the <lb/>instrument development). <lb/>The PES evaluated patient&apos;s perception, whereas ESPS was <lb/>completed by both patient and nurse with parallel questionnaires, <lb/>thus representing both perceptions of the consultation. Both instru-<lb/>ments targeted inpatients. Both instruments used a 3-point Likert <lb/>response scale. The PES contained 40 items and the ESPS con-<lb/>tained 44 items. <lb/>The PES was studied among specific patient populations <lb/>(elderly inpatients), while ESPS was validated among a more <lb/>diverse group of patients. Both studies involved nurses and were <lb/>conducted in Europe. <lb/> Discussion <lb/> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to <lb/>identify and compare instruments used to measure enablement <lb/>in a health care context. Two instruments were identified. The <lb/>PES is a 40-item instrument to assess inpatient&apos;s perception <lb/>of enablement. The ESPS, a 44-item instrument, assesses <lb/>enablement in hospital setting, from the patients&apos; and nurses&apos; <lb/>perspectives. <lb/>Both instruments were based on conceptual frameworks devel-<lb/>oped from studies conducted by the original authors of the instru-<lb/>ment. Basing instrument development on conceptual framework <lb/>may increase the content validity of the instrument [76–78]. <lb/>However, it is relevant to start with a critical review of the litera-<lb/>ture to have a more valid conceptual model [79,80]. As suggested <lb/>by Streiner and Norman [19], recent reviews and empirical <lb/>research [1–4] could be used in further attempts to improve these <lb/>instruments (PES and ESPS) or elaborate new ones. <lb/>The enablement model [1,3,4] and the patient-centred model <lb/>[5,81] share many common dimensions (contributing to the thera-<lb/>peutic relationship, building on the person&apos;s point of view, encour-<lb/>aging and supporting the decision-making process and facilitating <lb/>the learning experience), raising the question &apos;Is it the same <lb/>concept?&apos; Our view is that the enablement process is necessarily <lb/> Total citations identified: 3800 <lb/>Citations retrieved for detailed evaluation by two authors: 53 <lb/>Duplicate: 665 <lb/>Relevant articles: 3 (2 instruments) <lb/>And citations added with hand searching: 1 <lb/>Included articles: 4 (2 instruments) <lb/>Citations screened for evaluation: 3135 <lb/>Exclusion criteria: <lb/> • Not about development or validation of an instrument: 8 <lb/> • Concepts other than enablement: 6 <lb/> • Outside the therapeutic relationship: 31 <lb/> • Including only a sub-scale on enablement: 5 <lb/> Figure 1 Number of citations identified <lb/>through the stages of the systematic review. <lb/></body>

			<body> patient-centred but a patient-centred intervention does not <lb/>always correspond to an enablement intervention. Indeed, build-<lb/>ing on the person&apos;s strengths is central to the enablement model <lb/>[1,82–85]. <lb/>Another question that could be raised is &apos;How is the enablement <lb/>concept positioned among other concepts such as shared decision <lb/>making, patient participation . . .&apos; As stressed in our enablement <lb/>model (see Introduction), these last concepts could be considered <lb/>as sub-concepts of enablement. Our hypothesis is that improving <lb/>many aspects of the interaction between the patient and the health <lb/>care provider (referring to the dimensions of our enablement <lb/>model) is maybe more effective than improving only one or two <lb/>aspects. <lb/>The PES evaluates patient&apos;s perception, while ESPS considers <lb/>patient and professional&apos;s points of view. Some authors argued that <lb/>both points of view have to be taken into account to evaluate <lb/>professional&apos;s practices, because interaction of these points of <lb/>view is determinant in the intervention process [11,86]. Other <lb/>studies demonstrated stronger relationship between patient&apos;s per-<lb/>ceptions and various outcomes. For example, in one study, per-<lb/>ceived empowering care by patients was the most important <lb/>predictor of their quality of life [87]. Stewart et al. evaluated <lb/>patient-centredness, a concept regrouping many dimensions of <lb/>enablement. They demonstrated that the patient&apos;s perception was a <lb/>better predictor of certain outcomes at the end of a 2-month period <lb/>than that of a trained person scoring an instrument from the audio-<lb/>tape of the encounter. One of their conclusions was that the patient <lb/>outcomes will be affected only when the doctor&apos;s patient-<lb/>centeredness reaches a level that the patient notices [5]. This <lb/>conclusion may be true for enablement as well. Further studies are <lb/>needed to evaluate this hypothesis. <lb/>The existing instruments are cross-sectional measures to assess <lb/>enablement (PES and ESPS). It is appropriate when considering <lb/>patients provided with medical care in an inpatient context. <lb/>However, in an ambulatory care setting, because the interaction <lb/>between a patient and a health care provider (his or her family <lb/>doctor for example) may evolve over time, the enablement inter-<lb/>vention may develop on a longitudinal basis [88,89]. Therefore, <lb/>one has to wonder, before using these instruments in such a <lb/>context, whether they are appropriate to measure an inherently <lb/>longitudinal process. This perspective must be kept in mind while <lb/>developing or improving instruments to assess enablement in an <lb/>ambulatory care context. <lb/> Limitation of the study <lb/> One of the main limitations of a review is its inability to include all <lb/>of the relevant literature and unpublished material. We acknowl-<lb/>edge that some eligible articles may have been missed during the <lb/>search stage. However, our search strategy was adapted for differ-<lb/>ent databases, was developed with an information specialist and <lb/>favoured an exhaustive literature review. Our hand search and <lb/>correspondence with experts were other ways to help us identify <lb/>uncovered articles. We did not include articles in which enable-<lb/>ment was part of a larger concept, such as quality of care, because <lb/>of the risk of missing such subscales. Scales measuring sub-<lb/>concepts of enablement (shared decision making for example) or <lb/>measuring enablement as a sub-concept of another construct <lb/>could, however, be used in a pool of items in further instrument <lb/>development. <lb/> Conclusion <lb/> Two instruments (PES and ESPS) were identified that measure <lb/>enablement in the health care context. Both instruments assess <lb/>enablement in hospital setting, one from the patient&apos;s perspective <lb/>(PES) and the other from both the patient&apos;s and the nurse&apos;s per-<lb/>spective (ESPS). To date, there is no tool available to the clinicians <lb/>or researchers to assess enablement in an ambulatory care context. <lb/></body>
