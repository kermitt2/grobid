In <lb/>the framework of this model the possibility of describing all the main experimental data on the <lb/>dynamics of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching in H 2 : O 2 gas mixtures in the temperature range <lb/>T 0 = 300-1050 K is shown. Most of the collisions between singlet oxygen molecules and <lb/>atomic hydrogen, O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H, lead to quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ). The efficiency of this <lb/>interaction channel is more than 80% and the fraction of the reaction <lb/>H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → OH + O( 3 P) is only 10-20%. The impact of singlet oxygen O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>admixture on the ignition of H 2 : O 2 mixtures is investigated. The dominant process <lb/>determining the degree of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) impact is its deactivation by HO 2 molecules. As a result, <lb/>in H 2 : O 2 mixtures of high pressure, where the number density of the produced HO 2 <lb/>molecules can be sufficiently high, the impact of singlet oxygen on the ignition delay time of <lb/>these mixtures turns out to be relatively weak. This effect becomes even less noticeable if <lb/>admixtures of atomic oxygen are present in the mixture. Oxygen atoms produced by the <lb/>discharge are more efficient in the ignition of hydrogen-oxygen and hydrogen-air mixtures <lb/>than O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules. Thus, to reduce the ignition delay time and to decrease the <lb/>temperature threshold of combustive mixtures, the use of gas discharge systems providing the <lb/>efficient production of atomic particles is recommended. <lb/>(Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version) <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>To date, there have been numerous papers in which the effect <lb/>of chemically active radical admixtures on the shift of ignition <lb/>temperature threshold and decrease in the induction delay <lb/>time of combustive mixtures was studied. In these studies, to <lb/>obtain an initial concentration of chemically active particles, <lb/>UV radiation, electric discharges, electron beams, etc were <lb/>used [1]. A distinctive feature of the electric discharge effect <lb/>on combustive mixtures is that, as a result, various degrees <lb/>of freedom of molecules are excited [1-5]. Depending on <lb/>the value of the reduced electric field, E/N (N is the gas <lb/>number density), formed in the studied discharges, production <lb/>of different kinds of chemically active particles occurs. At high <lb/>E/N, a considerable part of the discharge energy is spent on <lb/>ionization and dissociation of molecules [6, 7], and in relatively <lb/>low fields, an efficient excitation of electronic states O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ), <lb/>O 2 (b 1 + <lb/>g ) takes place [8-10]. <lb/>Thus, one of the priorities is a comparative analysis <lb/>of the effect of various chemically active particles on the <lb/>characteristics of the ignition process. This will allow us <lb/>to choose a set of particles that is optimal with respect <lb/></body>

			<body>to the effect on ignition and, perhaps, to determine the <lb/>discharge characteristics providing nonequilibrium production <lb/>of chemically active particles in optimal ratios. <lb/>The problem of combustion and detonation initiation in <lb/>fuel mixtures in the presence of oxygen molecules O 2 (b 1 + <lb/>g ), <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) excited in a gas discharge plasma has recently been <lb/>studied [11-17]. In [11], apparently for the first time, reactions <lb/>involving O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) were used to explain the experimentally <lb/>observed increase in flame propagation velocity in H 2 : O 2 <lb/>mixtures, after excitation of oxygen by an electric discharge. <lb/>In these experiments, the oxygen flow passed through the glow <lb/>discharge (I = 5-85 mA) and then molecular hydrogen was <lb/>added to this flow. The resulting mixture (pressure P 0 = <lb/>50 Torr, T 0 = 293 K) contained 7% H 2 +93% O 2 and the O( 3 P), <lb/>O 3 , O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ), O 2 (b 1 + <lb/>g ) particles produced in the discharge. <lb/>The obtained mixture was ignited by a pulsed spark discharge <lb/>with subsequent measurements of normal flame velocity and <lb/>the axial profile of the gas temperature. <lb/>At discharge currents exceeding 17 mA, the flame velocity <lb/>almost doubled. But for all that, the increase in the gas <lb/>temperature in the discharge did not exceed 5-10 K. The results <lb/>of simulations [12, 16] confirmed the assumption that the <lb/>impact of a glow discharge in oxygen on the flame velocity is <lb/>likely associated with the participation of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules, <lb/>produced in the discharge, in the ignition processes. <lb/>In [14-16], the results from theoretical studies of the <lb/>impact of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules on the ignition delay time of <lb/>H 2 : O 2 : O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) mixtures are presented. A possibility of <lb/>a sufficient reduction in the ignition temperature threshold <lb/>and in the induction times of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures is <lb/>shown when the fraction of singlet delta oxygen (SDO) is <lb/>[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 1%. <lb/>One of the important processes that determines the <lb/>efficiency of SDO impact on the ignition delay time is the <lb/>following: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → OH + OH. <lb/>(1) <lb/>This process can result in sufficiently more rapid production of <lb/>chemically active particles by adding SDO. The rate constant <lb/>of reaction (1) increases essentially with the rise in gas <lb/>temperature. The corresponding dependence k 1 (T ) obtained <lb/>in [15] is shown in figure 1 (curve 1). <lb/>Along with this, quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) by hydrogen <lb/>molecules is also possible: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → O 2 + H 2 . <lb/>(2) <lb/>The rate constant of reaction (2) at T = 300 K was measured <lb/>in several experiments (see [18]). The calculation results of the <lb/>dependence of this reaction rate constant on gas temperature <lb/>are given in [19]. The approach adopted in this work is based on <lb/>assumptions that the spin ban on the transition O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → <lb/>O 2 (X 3 − <lb/>g ) is withdrawn by taking into account spin-orbit <lb/>interaction inside the O 2 molecule, that the kinetic energy <lb/>of relative motion is much more than the potential energy <lb/>of molecular interaction, and that the transition probability is <lb/>small. The last two conditions allow us to apply perturbation <lb/>theory. The results from the calculation of the dependence <lb/>k 2 (T ) [19] are shown in figure 1 (curve 2). Here (curve 3), the <lb/>300 <lb/>450 <lb/>600 <lb/>750 <lb/>900 <lb/>1050 <lb/>10 <lb/>-19 <lb/>10 <lb/>-18 <lb/>10 <lb/>-17 <lb/>10 <lb/>-16 <lb/>10 <lb/>-15 <lb/>10 <lb/>-14 <lb/>10 <lb/>-13 <lb/>3. <lb/>2. <lb/>1. <lb/>O 2 (a <lb/>1 ∆ g ) + H 2 <lb/>K, cm <lb/>3 <lb/>/s <lb/>Temperature, K <lb/>Figure 1. Dependences of reaction rate constants on <lb/>temperature: 1: O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → 2 • OH [15]; <lb/>2: O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → O 2 + H 2 [19]; 3: experimental data [20]. <lb/>results of the measurement of the quenching rate of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>obtained in [20] are also presented in the temperature range <lb/>T = 500-1000 K. In this paper the temporal dynamics of <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching in a H 2 : O 2 mixture (with the fraction <lb/>of hydrogen less than 2-3%) was measured. In [20], the <lb/>main mechanism of SDO quenching was associated with <lb/>reaction (2). As seen from figure 1, the experimentally <lb/>obtained rates of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) losses far exceed both the rate <lb/>constant of reaction k 1 (T ) [15] and the rate constant of SDO <lb/>deactivation k 2 (T ) [19]. One of the reasons for such a <lb/>difference might be the fact that the analysis of experimental <lb/>results [20] does not take into account the specifics of the <lb/>considered mixture in which chain chemical reactions can <lb/>proceed in the temperature range T 0 = 500-1000 K. As a <lb/>result, particles that can actively quench the SDO molecules <lb/>are produced, for example, H and HO 2 . Therefore, a further <lb/>numerical analysis of experimental results [20] is necessary to <lb/>determine the possible reasons for the high rate of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>loss under these conditions. <lb/>Other important processes for the combustion problems <lb/>are the following: <lb/>H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → OH + O( 3 P), <lb/>(3) <lb/>H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → H + O 2 . <lb/>(4) <lb/>These reactions were investigated experimentally in [21, 22] <lb/>in the temperature ranges T = 300-431 K and T = 520-<lb/>930 K, respectively. The total rate constant of processes (3) <lb/>and (4) was measured in these papers, and, according to [22], <lb/>reaction (3) is dominant. However, it has been shown in more <lb/>recent studies [23] that k 3 /(k 3 + k 4 ) 0.1 in the temperature <lb/>range T = 300-437 K. Thus, the ratio between the reaction <lb/>rates k 3 : k 4 remains unknown. <lb/>In [23, 24], the following process: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + HO 2 → O 2 + HO * <lb/>2 <lb/>(5) <lb/>was included to explain the experimental results concerning the <lb/>temporal dynamics of the atomic hydrogen concentration when <lb/></body>

In [25], higher rates of SDO quenching <lb/>by HO 2 molecules were reported, which amounted to k 5 = <lb/>3.0×10 −11 cm 3 s −1 . Consequently, reaction (5) can also affect <lb/>the dynamics of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules and the ignition delay <lb/>time of H 2 : O 2 : O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) mixtures. <lb/>The aim of this paper is to analyze the results from <lb/>the mentioned experiments and to explain the discrepancy <lb/>of data obtained. Based on this analysis, recommendations <lb/>concerning the rates of the main processes involving O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>(1)-(5) will be provided. This will make it possible to estimate <lb/>the impact of SDO molecules on the induction time and shift <lb/>of ignition temperature threshold for H 2 : O 2 mixtures. The <lb/>efficiency of singlet oxygen as an ignition initiator is analyzed <lb/>and compared with the efficiency of O( 3 P) atoms. <lb/>2. Model description <lb/>In [1], a model of ignition of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures <lb/>is described. The evolution of mixture composition was <lb/>described by a set of ordinary differential equations for <lb/>individual reagent concentrations N j : <lb/>dN j <lb/>dt <lb/>= F + <lb/>j − F − <lb/>j , <lb/>where F + <lb/>j and F − <lb/>j are the rates of production and consumption <lb/>of particle j , respectively [1]. <lb/>The expression for enthalpy H of the mixture is <lb/>represented as <lb/>H = N −1 µ −1 <lb/>S <lb/>j =1 <lb/>h 0j N j + C p • T , <lb/>P = <lb/>ρ • RT <lb/>µ <lb/>, <lb/>µ= N −1 <lb/>S <lb/>j =1 <lb/>µ j • N j , <lb/>N = <lb/>S <lb/>j =1 <lb/>N j . <lb/>Here, T is the gas temperature; h 0j is the enthalpy of formation <lb/>of the j th component at T = 298 K; S is the number of species; <lb/>C p is the constant pressure specific heat capacity of the mixture <lb/>(computed using specified data); P and ρ are the pressure and <lb/>density of gas, respectively; µ j is the molar weight of the j th <lb/>component of the mixture; R is the universal gas constant. <lb/>To test the developed model, we performed calculations <lb/>of the dependences of ignition delay time of H 2 : O 2 : N 2 : Ar <lb/>mixtures on the initial temperature in a broad range of pressures <lb/>and stoichiometric coefficients, as well as the dynamics of the <lb/>main components of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures during their <lb/>oxidation process. By comparing the results of calculations <lb/>with experimental data, we can conclude about the adequacy <lb/>of the description of available experimental results and the <lb/>possibility of using the developed kinetic model for predictive <lb/>calculations. In this paper, the system of reactions [1] <lb/>was supplemented by processes involving singlet oxygen <lb/>molecules O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) and O 2 (b 1 + <lb/>g ). These processes are <lb/>given in table 1. <lb/>3. Calculation results and discussion <lb/>3.1. Reaction H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) at T <lb/>430 K <lb/>In all the further considered experiments (except in cases <lb/>explicitly stated) studies were carried out in a flow reactor with <lb/>a system of flow mixing. O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules were produced, <lb/>typically, in a microwave discharge (in oxygen or O 2 : Ar, <lb/>O 2 : He mixtures). O( 3 P) atoms, which are also produced in <lb/>the discharge, were removed in reactions with mercury oxide <lb/>HgO, which coated the walls of the tube. Hydrogen atoms <lb/>were produced in a microwave discharge in argon (or helium) <lb/>with the admixture of H 2 . <lb/>In [21], the quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules by atomic <lb/>hydrogen was studied in a mixture of H 2 : O 2 : Ar at P = 0.3-<lb/>0.9 Torr. The experiments were conducted both in the presence <lb/>of O( 3 P) atoms and without them. After mixing the flows of <lb/>excited hydrogen and oxygen, temporal dynamics of O, H, <lb/>and also OH and O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) densities was studied using an <lb/>electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. Based <lb/>on these data, the rate of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) deactivation by hydrogen <lb/>atoms (k 3 + k 4 ) was determined at T = 300-431 K. To reduce <lb/>the probability of heterogeneous losses of active particles, the <lb/>tube walls were covered with orthoboric acid. As a result, <lb/>the reactions at the surface had practically no effect on the <lb/>dynamics of the main studied components and this was verified <lb/>experimentally. <lb/></body>

Temporal dynamics of the main components of the <lb/>mixture H 2 : O 2 : O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) : Ar at T = 300 K and at the ratio of <lb/>reaction rates k 3 : k 4 = 2 : 8. Dots correspond to the calculated <lb/>values of 2.17 • [O( 3 P)] at O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) = 0. The initial concentrations <lb/>of components are Ar = 9.1 × 10 15 cm −3 ; O 2 = 5.3 × 10 15 cm −3 ; <lb/>H 2 = 7.4 × 10 14 cm −3 ; H = 4.4 × 10 14 cm −3 and <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) = 5.5 × 10 14 cm −3 . <lb/>As an example, figure 2 shows the temporal dynamics <lb/>of the different components of the mixture which has the <lb/>following initial composition: Ar = 9.1 × 10 15 cm −3 , O 2 = <lb/>5.3×10 15 cm −3 , H 2 = 7.4×10 14 cm −3 , H = 4.4×10 14 cm −3 , <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) = 5.5 × 10 14 cm −3 , T 0 = 300 K. Under these <lb/>conditions the main channel of loss of SDO molecules is <lb/>the reactions with H atoms, the decay of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) being <lb/>monoexponential [21]. It is therefore necessary that the <lb/>hydrogen number density H(t) varies only slightly with time. <lb/>As seen from the calculation results presented in figure 2, this <lb/>condition is fulfilled. <lb/>In [23], another mechanism of SDO quenching associated <lb/>with reaction (5) O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + HO 2 → O 2 + HO 2 was <lb/>proposed to explain the experimental results [21]. According <lb/>to the calculations given in figure 2, the concentration of <lb/>HO 2 molecules within the considered time interval remains <lb/>practically constant, being ≈3 × 10 10 cm −3 in total. In this <lb/>case, the frequency of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching in reaction (5) <lb/>does not exceed ν a <lb/>0.6 s −1 , which is much lower than <lb/>the experimentally observed value under these conditions, <lb/>ν a ∼ = 8 s −1 [21]. So, the mechanism of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching <lb/>proposed in [23] is not sufficient under the conditions of <lb/>experiment [21]. <lb/>It was also shown in [21] that the concentration of <lb/>atomic oxygen increased under these conditions by adding <lb/>molecules of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ). These data can be used to determine <lb/>the fractions of reaction channels (3) and (4). According <lb/>to [21], the addition of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules with number <lb/>density 5.5 × 10 14 cm −3 to the studied mixture increases the <lb/>concentration of atomic oxygen by a factor of 2.17. To <lb/>obtain the value of ξ = [O( 3 P)]/[O( 3 P)] 0 = 2.17 in the <lb/>calculations, it is necessary to suggest that the ratio of reaction <lb/>rates k 3 : k 4 is about 2 : 8 (see figure 3). It is worth mentioning <lb/>that taking into account the uncertainty associated with the <lb/>heterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on the tube <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>1 0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>H 2 : O 2 : O 2 (a <lb/>1 ∆ g ) <lb/>K <lb/>3 / (K <lb/>3 + K <lb/>4 <lb/>) <lb/>O 2 (a <lb/>1 ∆ g ) *10 <lb/>14 cm <lb/>-3 <lb/>Figure 3.

Here, as in [21], the mixing of hydrogen and oxygen <lb/>flows excited by microwave discharges took place. The <lb/>concentrations of O and H atoms were measured by the <lb/>radiation absorption technique at wavelengths λ = 130.5 nm <lb/>and λ = 121.6 nm, respectively. To determine the OH number <lb/>density, the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique was <lb/>used for the transition OH(X 2 , v = 0) → OH(A 2 , v = <lb/>0) (λ = 308.2 nm). The content of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules was <lb/>determined by the value and dynamics of the photoionization <lb/>current formed as a result of absorption of Ar lamp radiation <lb/>(λ = 106.7 nm) by SDO molecules. <lb/>Figure 4 shows the experimental data [23] and the <lb/>calculation results of the temporal dynamics of some <lb/>components produced in a mixture of He = 3.3 × 10 16 cm −3 , <lb/>O 2 = 6.0×10 15 cm −3 and H = 5.0×10 11 cm −3 at T = 300 K. <lb/>The main reactions determining the evolution of number <lb/>density of H and O( 3 P) atoms and OH and HO 2 molecules <lb/>in this case are the following: <lb/>H + O 2 + M → HO 2 + M, <lb/>(6) <lb/>H + HO 2 → OH + OH, <lb/>(7) <lb/>OH + OH → O + H 2 O, <lb/>(8) <lb/>O + HO 2 → OH + O 2 , <lb/>(9) <lb/>O + OH → H + O 2 . <lb/>(10) <lb/>It should be noted that in order to compare the calculation <lb/>results with the experimental data on the temporal dynamics of <lb/>OH radicals, the rate constant of reaction (7) was taken equal to <lb/>k 7 = 3.8×10 −11 cm 3 s −1 as proposed in [23].

One <lb/>of the reasons for the difference in results could be the errors <lb/>in determining the absolute values of H atom number density. <lb/>As shown by our calculations, a decrease in the absolute values <lb/>of [H] 0 concentration by approximately 22-25% allows us to <lb/>describe the temporal dynamics of OH radicals measured in <lb/>[23] at a value of k 7 = 6.6×10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , which corresponds <lb/>to the recommendations [29]. <lb/>Addition of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules to the mixture results in <lb/>a sufficient increase in the concentration of produced O( 3 P) <lb/>atoms, but it decreases OH density and the rate of hydrogen <lb/>atom losses [23, 24]. To explain such dynamics of H atoms, we <lb/>should assume the possibility of destruction of HO 2 molecules <lb/>in the reaction with O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) and production of hydrogen <lb/>atoms in this reaction. <lb/>It is well known that HO 2 molecules are produced in a <lb/>highly excited state in process (6): <lb/>H + O 2 + M → HO * <lb/>2 + M. <lb/>In this paper, the dissociation of HO * <lb/>2 molecules was <lb/>additionally considered to explain the results [23, 24]: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + HO * <lb/>2 → H + 2 • O 2 . <lb/>(11) <lb/>In addition, the possible quenching of HO * <lb/>2 molecules was <lb/>taken into account [24]: <lb/>HO * <lb/>2 + He → HO 2 + He <lb/>k = 1.7 × 10 −12 cm 3 s −1 . <lb/>The calculated and experimental temporal dynamics of <lb/>the main considered components are given in figure 5. The <lb/>initial conditions were taken to be the same as in figure 4 but <lb/>the addition of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules ([O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )] = 2.6 × <lb/>10 14 cm −3 ) was taken into account. The calculation results <lb/>were obtained at k 11 = 5.0 × 10 −10 cm 3 s −1 .

The simulation results presented in figure 5 <lb/>were obtained at α = 10%. It is worth mentioning that taking <lb/>into account the possible errors in determining [H] 0 (mentioned <lb/>above), i.e. decreasing the initial H atom density by 25%, <lb/>results in an increase in α up to 16-17%, which is close to the <lb/>values obtained in the processing of the experimental data [21]. <lb/>It is noted in [23] that the temporal dynamics of O( 3 P) <lb/>concentration changes with increasing pressure in the range <lb/>P = 0.1-7 Torr. This may indicate that the value of α depends <lb/>on pressure. However, other explanations of this phenomenon <lb/>are possible (for example, reduction in the characteristic <lb/>diffusion time and, correspondingly, the rate of heterogeneous <lb/>losses of O( 3 P) atoms with increasing pressure). Since <lb/>the experimental data on the dependence of atomic oxygen <lb/>concentration on pressure are not given in [23], it is difficult <lb/>to draw a conclusion on the causes of this phenomenon. <lb/>Thus, a comparative analysis of experimental results <lb/>([21] and [23, 24]) allows us to draw the following conclusions. <lb/>In [21], due to the low gas pressure, the degree of conversion <lb/>of atomic hydrogen to HO 2 is low during the times considered. <lb/>Therefore, the main contribution to O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching <lb/>occurs due to the reactions with H atoms, and quenching by <lb/>HO 2 can be neglected. In [23, 24], due to a higher pressure, <lb/>atomic hydrogen is quickly converted to HO 2 and the reactions <lb/>between SDO molecules and HO 2 become dominant (HO 2 can <lb/>be in the ground and excited states). The results from numerical <lb/>simulations of data ([21] and [23]) concerning the production <lb/>of O( 3 P) atoms point out that the fraction of reaction (3) <lb/>is α = 10-20%. <lb/></body>

Reaction H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) at T &gt; 500 K <lb/>To analyze the effect of singlet oxygen molecules on the <lb/>ignition of combustive mixtures, the data on the rates <lb/>of reactions involving O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) at temperatures above <lb/>450-500 K are of great interest. In [22], the quenching <lb/>rates of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules were measured in a mixture <lb/>of He : O 2 : H 2 at temperatures T 0 = 522-933 K and <lb/>pressures P = 1.5-6 Torr with an initial content of SDO <lb/>[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 0 ∼ = 10%. The residence time of the mixture <lb/>in the reaction zone (the zone of high temperature) amounted to <lb/>τ r = 2-3 ms. The temporal dynamics of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching <lb/>due to the reactions with H atoms was measured in the <lb/>experiments. Atomic hydrogen was produced in the following <lb/>process: <lb/>O( 3 P) + H 2 → OH + H <lb/>(12) <lb/>(or in the discharge in the hydrogen flow). Based on <lb/>measurements of the ratio [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )(t)]/[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )] 0 and the <lb/>concentration of atomic hydrogen produced during τ r , the <lb/>total rate constant of the reactions (k 3 + k 4 ) was determined, <lb/>corresponding to a given temperature. But it was assumed <lb/>that the concentration of H atoms increases linearly with time. <lb/>By comparing the simulation results with measurements of H, <lb/>O and O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) densities, the authors of [22] concluded that <lb/>α = k 3 /(k 3 + k 4 ) ≈ 1. However, the results of the comparison <lb/>are not given in [22]. <lb/>Figure 6 presents the time evolution of a 6% <lb/>H 2 : 3% O 2 : 91% He mixture composition for the con-<lb/>ditions [22] P = 3 Torr, T 0 = 600 K, [O( 3 P)]/[O 2 ] = <lb/>[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] = 10%. The solid curves correspond to <lb/>α = 1, the dashed ones are for α = 0.1. As follows from these <lb/>calculations, the change in the ratio of rate constants k 3 : k 4 <lb/>by a factor of 10 has practically no effect on the temporal dy-<lb/>namics of atomic hydrogen and O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) concentrations. A <lb/>noticeable difference is observed only for the concentrations <lb/>of OH radicals. Thus, the conclusion (α 0.2 at T 0 430 K) <lb/>based on the processing of experimental data [21, 23] does not <lb/>contradict the results of [22] obtained at higher temperatures <lb/>(T 0 = 522-933 K). <lb/>The number density of HO 2 molecules does not exceed <lb/>7 × 10 9 cm −3 under the considered conditions. Therefore, <lb/>the mechanism of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching by HO 2 (5) proposed <lb/>in [23, 24] fails to explain the experimental data [22]. We <lb/>note that a similar conclusion was reached earlier for the <lb/>experimental conditions [21]. <lb/>It is worth mentioning that the accuracy of determining the <lb/>rate constant for O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching under the conditions <lb/>of [22] at T 0 <lb/>700 K, apparently, is relatively small, since <lb/>the change in the value of [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )(t)]/[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )] 0 is also <lb/>very small at time τ r (see figure 6) (recall that τ r <lb/>3 ms). <lb/>This is also evidenced by the scatter of the measurement <lb/>results given in [22]. With a rise in initial temperature, <lb/>the ratio [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )] 0 sufficiently increases and <lb/>the accuracy of determining the rate constant of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>quenching should also increase. <lb/>In [20], SDO dynamics in a hot hydrogen-oxygen mixture <lb/>was also studied. The measurements were carried out in <lb/>approximately the same range of temperatures (T 0 = 520-<lb/>1050 K) as in [22]. O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules were produced in <lb/>a microwave discharge in oxygen flow. Then O( 3 P) atoms <lb/>were removed (in reactions with mercury oxide HgO) and H 2 <lb/>molecules were added. The fraction of hydrogen in the mixture <lb/>varied from 0.5% to 3%. The fraction of SDO molecules <lb/>amounts to [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 0 <lb/>5%. The population of the <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) state was determined by measuring the intensity of <lb/>&apos;dimole&apos; radiation: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )+ O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → 2 • O 2 (X 3 − <lb/>g ) + hν (λ = 634 nm), <lb/>and it was also monitored by measuring the radiation intensity <lb/>at the transition: <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → O 2 (X 3 − <lb/>g ) + hν (λ = 1.27 µm); <lb/>in particular, the fulfilment of the following ratio was <lb/>monitored: <lb/>(I λ=634 nm ) 2 ∝ I λ=1.27 µm . <lb/>Under the conditions of [20], SDO quenching by oxygen <lb/>molecules and in process (7) (table 1) makes no substantial <lb/>contribution to the deactivation of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules, which <lb/>was associated with the reaction O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → O 2 + H 2 <lb/>(2) according to the authors of [20]. As has already been <lb/>noted, the possibility of production of hydrogen atoms and <lb/>HO 2 molecules in a given mixture was not taken into account <lb/>in [20]. However, these particles, as seen from the foregoing <lb/>analysis, are actively involved in SDO quenching. <lb/>O( 3 P) atoms produced in the discharge [20] were removed <lb/>in reactions with mercury oxide. But it was noted in [27] that <lb/>the addition of NO molecules after the discharge did not lead <lb/>to the characteristic glow of excited NO * <lb/>2 molecules produced <lb/>in the reaction [30] <lb/>O( 3 P) + NO → NO * <lb/>2 . <lb/>(13) <lb/>This indicates a low concentration of atomic oxygen in the <lb/>mixing zone of H 2 and O 2 flows [20]. <lb/></body>

The minimum of NO * <lb/>2 <lb/>radiation power detected by the human eye (in the range of <lb/>wavelengths λ = 500-600 nm) is 10 −9 -10 −10 W cm −3 . This <lb/>corresponds to I min <lb/>NO 2 = 10 9 -10 10 photon •cm −3 s −1 . Hence, <lb/>we can estimate the maximum number density of oxygen <lb/>atoms at which there is no noticeable glow of NO * <lb/>2 .

Furthermore, it is assumed in the <lb/>calculations that the initial dissociation degree of oxygen <lb/>molecules does not exceed [O( 3 P)]/[O 2 ] 0 3 × 10 −5 . <lb/>To describe the temporal dynamics of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>quenching under the conditions of [20], the evolution of <lb/>mixture composition 97% O 2 : 1% H 2 : 2% O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) was <lb/>simulated at [O( 3 P)]/[O 2 ] <lb/>3 × 10 −5 . The shock wave <lb/>Mach number was set and gas parameters (density, pressure <lb/>and temperature) were calculated behind the shock front at <lb/>P 0 = 6 Torr, T 0 = 300 K. These parameters were used as initial <lb/>conditions for further calculations. The total number density of <lb/>molecules behind the shock wave is approximately (5.5-8.5)× <lb/>10 17 cm −3 [20]; the tube radius is R = 2.5 cm. In this case the <lb/>characteristic time of the diffusion process exceeds 30 ms (for <lb/>hydrogen atoms). The probability of heterogeneous losses of <lb/>atomic hydrogen at the quartz surface is γ = (2 -4)×10 −3 [31, <lb/>32] at T w = 500-1000 K.

Accordingly, the characteristic <lb/>frequency of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching in reactions with atomic <lb/>hydrogen (reactions (3) and (4)) also increases and these <lb/>reactions become the main channel of SDO loss under these <lb/>conditions. The number density of HO 2 molecules does not <lb/>exceed 10 13 cm −3 in this case. <lb/>Based on the calculations, the effective rate constant <lb/>of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching by H 2 molecules was determined <lb/>(K eff = ([H 2 ] 0 • τ a ) −1 , where τ a is the time at which the initial <lb/>concentration of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules decreases 2.7 times). <lb/>The obtained values were compared with the experimental <lb/>data [20]. <lb/>Figure 8 presents the calculation results of the rate constant <lb/>K eff versus initial temperature (curves 1) and the measuring <lb/>data [20].

However, the <lb/>main quenching process of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) occurs in this case not <lb/>due to H 2 molecules, but due to hydrogen atoms (reactions (3) <lb/>and (4)). In the case of lower initial temperatures (T 0 <lb/>700 K), the shape of the calculated dependence K eff (T ) differs <lb/>significantly from the results of measurements [20]. Moreover, <lb/>this difference is observed both at α = 0.2 and α = 1. <lb/>In [16], calculations of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules quenching <lb/>dynamics were also performed under the experimental <lb/>conditions of [20].

These values agree with the results of our <lb/>calculations (at α = 1) given in figure 8 (dashed curve). <lb/>That means that the authors of [16] also failed to explain the <lb/>experimental data [20] at initial temperatures below 700 K. <lb/>The reason for the sharp decrease in the effective rate <lb/>constant of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching with falling temperature (at <lb/>T <lb/>700 K) is the significant decrease in the atomic hydrogen <lb/>concentration. <lb/>H atoms are produced mainly by the reaction <lb/>O( 3 P) + H 2 → OH + H, <lb/>(12) <lb/>which is the main reaction of chain branching. However, with <lb/>an increase in the fraction of HO 2 molecules, the following <lb/>process: <lb/>O( 3 P) + HO 2 → OH + O 2 <lb/>starts to compete with (12). In this process the loss of <lb/>oxygen atoms also takes place but without chain branching. <lb/>Figure 9 shows the calculation results of the temporal <lb/>dynamics of several components of a mixture O 2 : 1% H 2 : 2% <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) : 10 −4 %O( 3 P) at T 0 = 650 K. The number density <lb/>of atomic hydrogen decreases almost 10 3 times compared with <lb/>the calculation results presented in figure 7 carried out at <lb/>T 0 = 800 K. Accordingly, the quenching rate of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>molecules is sharply reduced, as shown in figure 8 (curves 1). <lb/>Thus, the experimental data [20] on deactivation of SDO <lb/>molecules can be explained at high temperatures, T <lb/>750 K, by the quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) by the hydrogen atoms <lb/>which are effectively produced in the considered mixture <lb/>at these temperatures. However, this process has already <lb/>failed to explain the experimental results at T <lb/>700 K. <lb/>Let us consider other possible mechanisms of deactivation of <lb/>SDO molecules capable of providing the rates of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>quenching, observed in [20], at T = 500-700 K. <lb/>One such mechanism could be heterogeneous quenching <lb/>of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules on the tube walls. Under the <lb/>considered conditions, deactivation of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules <lb/>at the wall proceeds in the kinetic mode. The frequency of <lb/>Table 2.

The formula γ = 7.4 × 10 −3 • <lb/>exp(−2240/T w ) was obtained in [32] for the probability of <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching at quartz surface at T w = 520-825 K <lb/>which was used to estimate ν get . The corresponding values of <lb/>ν get (in the temperature range T w = 500-700 K) are given in <lb/>table 2. It was assumed that the wall temperature is equal to the <lb/>gas temperature, T w ≈ T . For comparison, the values of the <lb/>characteristic frequencies of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) quenching in volume <lb/>processes ν a = [H 2 ] 0 • K eff are also given in table 2. The <lb/>expression for K eff (T ) obtained in [20] was used: K eff (T ) = <lb/>2.0 × 10 −13 • exp(−2600/T ) cm 3 s −1 . <lb/>As follows from the given values, the inequation ν a <lb/>ν get <lb/>is satisfied in the whole considered range of temperatures. So, <lb/>heterogeneous deactivation of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules at the tube <lb/>walls can be ignored under the conditions of [20]. <lb/>Another possible mechanism of singlet oxygen loss is <lb/>quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) by HO 2 molecules produced in the <lb/>H 2 : O 2 : O( 3 P) mixture at these temperatures. The quenching <lb/>rate of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) by HO 2 molecules (reaction (5), table 1) <lb/>was determined in [25], which studied the results of O 3 : H 2 O <lb/>mixture photolysis in the Hartley band (λ = 253 nm) at <lb/>P = 67.5 Torr. The rate constant of reaction (5) was <lb/>k 5 = (3 ± 1.5) × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 according to [25]. Such a <lb/>high value of this rate constant is explained in this case by <lb/>the quasi-resonance character of the transitions O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) → <lb/>O 2 (X 3 − <lb/>g ) and HO 2 (A 2 A ) → HO 2 (X 2 A ) [33]. <lb/>The calculation results from the model involving <lb/>reaction (5) are given in figure 8 for mixtures containing 1% <lb/>H 2 (curve 2) and 0.5% H 2 (curve 3). These results agree with <lb/>the experimental data [20] over the entire studied temperature <lb/>range. Note that the difference between the calculated values <lb/>of K eff (T ) for mixtures with different hydrogen content is <lb/>relatively small, which is also consistent with the data [20]. As <lb/>a result, the main quenching process of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules at <lb/>T 0 700 K occurs again (as in the case of higher temperatures) <lb/>not due to hydrogen molecules, as assumed by the authors <lb/>of [20], but due to the produced HO 2 molecules. <lb/>It is important that variation of the rate constants k 1 and <lb/>k 2 has a weak effect on the calculation results, so that the <lb/>experimental data [20] cannot be used to determine the rate <lb/>constants of reactions of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) with hydrogen molecules <lb/>(reactions (1) and (2)) more precisely. <lb/>3.3.

Temporal dynamics of the temperature and <lb/>concentrations of some components of a stoichiometric H 2 : air <lb/>mixture at P = 1 atm, T 0 = 900 K and [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 0 = 1%. <lb/>ignition delay times on initial temperature were performed <lb/>for different fractions of reaction (3). The rate constant of <lb/>reaction (1) was taken as in [15] (table 1) while the fraction <lb/>of reaction (3), α = k 3 /(k 3 + k 4 ), was varied from 0.1 to 1. <lb/>Figure 10 presents the calculation results of ignition delay <lb/>times of stoichiometric H 2 : air mixture (in the case of α = 0.2) <lb/>at P = 1 atm and at different initial concentrations of singlet <lb/>oxygen O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) and O( 3 P) atoms. All results were compared <lb/>with curve 1 obtained at concentrations [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )] 0 = <lb/>[O( 3 P)] 0 = 0. Curve 2 corresponds to the initial ratio <lb/>[O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 0 = 1%. As can be seen, the addition of 1% <lb/>O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) does not lead to a significant decrease in the ignition <lb/>temperature threshold which distinguishes the obtained results <lb/>from those given in [14, 15]. <lb/>Figure 11 shows the calculations of the temporal dynamics <lb/>of the main components and the temperature of the H 2 : air <lb/>mixture at P = 1 atm, [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ] 0 = 1%, T 0 = 900 K. <lb/>Number density of HO 2 molecules is (1-6) × 10 14 cm −3 over <lb/>a time range t = 100-700 µs which leads to a rapid quenching <lb/>of SDO molecules by these particles. During the ignition <lb/>time (τ ind ∼ = 740 µs) the concentration of singlet oxygen <lb/>reduced by more than 100 times. We note some increase in <lb/>the concentration of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules over the time range <lb/>720-780 µs which is associated with the intensification of the <lb/>process O + OH → H + O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) (the rate constant k(T ) <lb/>was taken from [14]). In addition, the rate of SDO quenching <lb/>by HO 2 molecules decreases over this time range as their <lb/>density falls. <lb/>Thus, a relatively small effect of SDO admixtures on <lb/>the ignition of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures occurs due to the <lb/>rapid quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) by HO 2 molecules. The HO 2 <lb/>molecules are actively produced in H 2 : O 2 mixtures under the <lb/>considered conditions. <lb/>One of the main sources of singlet oxygen is an electrical <lb/>discharge [10], which allows us to achieve a sufficiently high <lb/>degree of excitation of [O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )]/[O 2 ]. This is confirmed by <lb/>experimental results ([8-10] and so on) obtained for different <lb/>types of discharges. However, as SDO is produced by an <lb/>electric discharge, a large fraction of discharge energy can be <lb/>spent on the dissociation of O 2 molecules. In this case it is <lb/>necessary to consider the total effect (admixtures of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>and atomic oxygen) on the ignition of combustible mixtures. <lb/>An example of such a calculation is presented in figure 10 <lb/>(curves 3 and 4) which shows the ignition delay times of <lb/>a H 2 : air mixture with addition of [O( 3 P)]/[O 2 ] = 0.1% <lb/>(curve 3) and with the total effect of 1% O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) and <lb/>0.1% O( 3 P) (curve 4). As seen, adding 0.1% oxygen atoms <lb/>results in a significant decrease in the induction delay time <lb/>and in the ignition temperature threshold of the considered <lb/>mixture. Additional admixing of another 1% O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) to this <lb/>mixture does not give a noticeable improvement in ignition <lb/>characteristics, as is evident from the comparison of curves <lb/>3 and 4. That is, in the presence of even a small initial <lb/>concentration of atomic particles, the effect of SDO molecules <lb/>reduces in comparison with the unexcited ([O( 3 P)] 0 = 0) <lb/>mixture. The reason for this is that the addition of O( 3 P) <lb/>atoms leads to a reduction of the role of reaction (1) as the <lb/>chain initiation process. The contribution of the reaction of <lb/>chain branching (3) is also small at the given temperatures [1]. <lb/>Therefore, under the considered conditions, the effect of singlet <lb/>oxygen admixtures reduces to only additional heating of the <lb/>mixture in the process of its deactivation. <lb/>4. Conclusions <lb/>A kinetic model describing the effect of SDO O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) <lb/>admixtures on the evolution of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures <lb/>was developed. The dynamics of SDO quenching in H 2 : O 2 <lb/>mixtures was calculated under the experimental conditions <lb/>of [20-24] in the temperature range T 0 = 300-1050 K. The <lb/>possibility of describing the entire set of experimental data <lb/>[20-24] in the framework of the model was illustrated. <lb/>The effect of singlet oxygen O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) admixtures on <lb/>the ignition of H 2 : O 2 mixtures was studied.

			<body>molecules can participate in the reactions of both chain <lb/>initiation (O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → OH + OH)) and chain branching <lb/>(O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H → OH + O). By comparing the results of <lb/>calculations with experimental data, the following conclusions <lb/>on the rates of these processes can be drawn. Most of the <lb/>collisions of SDO molecules with atomic hydrogen O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g )+ <lb/>H lead to quenching of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) molecules (reaction (4)). <lb/>Share of this channel is more than 80% and the reaction of <lb/>chain branching is observed only in 10-20% of the cases. <lb/>It is not possible to determine the rate constant of the <lb/>process O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) + H 2 → OH + OH (1) on the basis of <lb/>available experimental data. So, the values of k 1 (T ) remain <lb/>undetermined. <lb/>An important process that determines the effect of SDO <lb/>molecules on the ignition characteristics of hydrogen-oxygen <lb/>mixtures is its deactivation by HO 2 molecules. According <lb/>to [25, 33], this reaction is very effective. As a result, in <lb/>H 2 : O 2 mixtures at high pressures, where the concentration <lb/>of produced HO 2 molecules can be sufficiently high, the effect <lb/>of singlet oxygen on the ignition delay times of these mixtures <lb/>is relatively weak. This effect becomes even less noticeable if <lb/>the mixture contains an initial concentration of oxygen atoms. <lb/>The last case is typical when electrical discharge systems are <lb/>used for the production of singlet oxygen. The presence of even <lb/>a small (10 −4 ) initial concentration of atomic oxygen reduces <lb/>the effect of O 2 (a 1 <lb/>g ) admixtures on the processes of ignition <lb/>to only additional heating of the mixture in the process of SDO <lb/>deactivation. <lb/>Thus, to reduce the ignition delay time and decrease the <lb/>temperature threshold of combustive mixtures, the use of gas <lb/>discharge systems providing the efficient production of atomic <lb/>particles is recommended. <lb/></body>
