			<front>ABSTRACT: <lb/>North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster are thought to derive from both <lb/>European and African source populations, but despite their importance for genetic <lb/>research, patterns of admixture along their genomes are essentially undocumented. Here, I <lb/>infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) <lb/>and the D. melanogaster reference genome. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was <lb/>estimated to be 20% for the DGRP and 9% for the reference genome. Based on the size of <lb/>admixture tracts and the approximate timing of admixture, I estimate that the DGRP <lb/>population underwent roughly 13.9 generations per year. Notably, ancestry levels varied <lb/>strikingly among genomic regions, with significantly less African introgression on the X <lb/>chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes <lb/>such as circadian rhythm. An important role for natural selection during the admixture <lb/>process was further supported by a genome--wide signal of ancestry disequilibrium, in that <lb/>many between--chromosome pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa--Europe allele <lb/>combinations. These results support the hypothesis that admixture between partially <lb/>genetically isolated Drosophila populations led to natural selection against incompatible <lb/>genetic variants, and that this process is ongoing. The ancestry blocks inferred here may be <lb/>relevant for the performance of reference alignment in this species, and may bolster the <lb/>design and interpretation of many population genetic and association mapping studies. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION: <lb/>North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster have had a disproportionate <lb/>role in classical and modern Drosophila genetics. They gave rise to many of the commonly <lb/>used laboratory strains that came from the T. H. Morgan lab and elsewhere. More recently, <lb/>the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) [1,2] introduced a set of 205 sequenced <lb/>genomes from independent inbred lines collected from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. The <lb/>DGRP has become a widely used resource for analyses of genomic variation and its relation <lb/>to phenotype. Understanding the demographic history of the DGRP and other North <lb/>American populations is important for maximizing the scientific value of these genetic <lb/>resources. However, D. melanogaster is not native to the western hemisphere, and the <lb/>recently arrived New World populations of this species appear to have complex origins. <lb/>D. melanogaster originated from sub--Saharan Africa [3], and probably from southern--<lb/>central Africa in particular [4], where at some unknown time it became associated with <lb/>human settlement. The species began to expand its geographic range, initially occupying <lb/>more diverse environments within sub--Saharan Africa. On the order of 10,000 years ago, <lb/>D. melanogaster managed to cross the Saharan region and expand into northern Africa and <lb/>Eurasia [3,5,6]. That expansion entailed a significant loss of genetic diversity, perhaps as a <lb/>result of founder event population bottlenecks, with the consequence that non--sub--<lb/>Saharan populations hold only a subset of the variation observed within sub--Saharan Africa <lb/>[4,5]. <lb/>The expansion of D. melanogaster from a tropical ancestral range into temperate Old <lb/>World regions appears to have had important consequences regarding adaptation to novel <lb/>environments and the restriction of migration between sub--Saharan and Palearctic <lb/></body>

			<body>populations. Tropical and temperate populations have a range of morphological <lb/>differences [7], and the genomic search for loci that may encode adaptive differences <lb/>between these populations has been a topic of significant interest [4,8]. Partial sexual <lb/>isolation has also been reported between African and non--African strains: female flies <lb/>from African strains were found to discriminate strongly against non--African males <lb/>[9,10,11]. <lb/>North American populations of D. melanogaster are thought to derive from both <lb/>European and African source populations. Evidence for this dual ancestry comes from <lb/>three population genetic observations from North American vs. European populations. <lb/>First, North American populations are more genetically similar to sub--Saharan populations <lb/>than Eurasian populations are [5,12--14]. Second, these same four studies all indicate that <lb/>North American populations have higher genetic diversity than European populations, an <lb/>observation that seems incompatible with a simple European origin for North American <lb/>populations. And third, a North American population was found to have elevated linkage <lb/>disequilibrium relative to a European population [13], which is likewise consistent with <lb/>recent admixture in North America. The apparent dual ancestry of North American D. <lb/>melanogaster may have resulted from a history in which European populations initially <lb/>colonized the northeast U.S., while African populations first reached the Caribbean [15,16], <lb/>with subsequent geographic expansion and interbreeding leading to admixed populations. <lb/>Specific evidence that the North Carolina DGRP population is admixed comes from the <lb/>analysis of Duchen et al. [17], who estimated these genomes to contain 15% African <lb/>ancestry. That study focused on the inference of historical parameters in D. melanogaster, <lb/>whereas the present study began by analyzing population ancestry along DGRP genomes. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>That analysis ultimately led to evidence that natural selection pervasively influenced the <lb/>admixture process in this North American population, and continues to act on <lb/>combinations of European and African alleles today. In addition to the DGRP, I also <lb/>estimated ancestry along the D. melanogaster reference genome. Knowledge of DGRP <lb/>ancestry will be important for interpreting genetic and phenotypic variation in that <lb/>population, whereas mapping the European and African segments of the reference genome <lb/>has important implications for the performance of reference alignment for sequenced D. <lb/>melanogaster genomes. <lb/>RESULTS: <lb/>Genome--wide ancestry proportions for DGRP and the timing of admixture <lb/>Non--African vs. sub--Saharan ancestry along North American D. melanogaster genomes <lb/>was assessed using the method of Pool et al. [4]. This Hidden Markov Model (HMM) <lb/>approach operates in genomic windows, comparing a focal genome to a non--African <lb/>reference panel of genomes, and testing whether these genetic distances fit expectations <lb/>based on comparisons among non--African genomes or instead match the larger distances <lb/>obtained from African vs. non--African comparisons. Among the 205 DGRP genomes, <lb/>inferred African ancestry averaged 19.8% with a standard deviation of 5.5% (Table S1). <lb/>From inversion--free chromosome arms, 24,034 African ancestry tracts of at least 0.05 <lb/>cM were free of large--scale missing data. Based on recombination rate estimates of <lb/>Comeron et al. [18], these tracts had a median length of 0.173 cM. Using an admixture tract <lb/>length simulation approach [19] with appropriate ancestral population proportions, I <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>estimate that this median tract size would be expected after ~1,513 generations of <lb/>admixture. The accuracy of this estimate may be affected by demographic details, natural <lb/>selection, and imprecision in recombination estimates. <lb/>DGRP ancestry proportions are highly variable along the genome <lb/>Examining collective DGRP ancestry for each window, striking genome--wide variability <lb/>was detected (Figure 1). Surprisingly, the X chromosome is nearly fixed for European <lb/>ancestry, with localized exceptions. Whereas the autosomes carry 21.8% African ancestry, <lb/>for the X chromosome this average is reduced to 5%. 75.1% of X--linked windows have <lb/>&lt;5% African ancestry and 37.8% are completely fixed for European ancestry. In contrast, <lb/>an outlier for higher African ancestry is chromosome arm 2L (Figure 1). This arm effect is <lb/>largely explained by the prevalence of inversion In(2L)t (Figure S1), the most common <lb/>African--origin inversion in the DGRP [2,20]. In(2L)t and other inversions can have strong <lb/>effects on genetic variation across whole chromosome arms (Figure 2) [4,20]. <lb/>More perplexing than the between--arm ancestry differences are the strong fluctuations <lb/>observed within chromosome arms, often on the scale of tens or hundreds of kilobases <lb/>(Figure 1). For each chromosome arm, there is a significant negative correlation (P &lt; <lb/>0.0001) between African ancestry and recombination rate, with Pearson r 2 of 0.080 for <lb/>standard autosomal arms analyzed jointly and 0.101 for the X chromosome. The mean sub--<lb/>Saharan ancestry proportion is 30.2% for autosomal windows below 0.5 cM / Mb, but only <lb/>13.0% when the recombination rate is above 4 cM / Mb (Figure 3). This relationship is not <lb/>expected under a neutral introgression scenario, but might result either from inefficient <lb/>selection in low recombination regions against African alleles that are disadvantageous in <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>the predominantly European gene pool and North American environment of the DGRP <lb/>population, or from favored African alleles carrying longer linkage blocks in regions of low <lb/>recombination. <lb/>Using simulations based on previously inferred demographic parameters, Pool et al. [4] <lb/>found that admixture on the order of 1,000 generations ago between African and European <lb/>populations of D. melanogaster was detected reliably by the method implemented here. <lb/>The few errors tended to involve missing unusually short admixture tracts, rather than <lb/>inferring false tracts. Those simulations focused on the autosomes because X--linked <lb/>admixture will be easier to detect (based on the much larger diversity difference between <lb/>African and European populations for the X chromosome). Hence, the lower X--linked <lb/>admixture levels described above contradict the predictions of methodological bias. Nor is <lb/>the recombination result easily explainable by such bias: low recombination window <lb/>lengths were scaled to contain similar numbers of polymorphisms as high recombination <lb/>regions, and Europe/Africa diversity ratio is typically similar across high and low <lb/>recombination regions of chromosome arms [4], so there is no obvious prediction of a <lb/>difference in the power to detect admixture between these categories. <lb/>Impact of natural selection on ancestry inferences <lb/>There are reasons to be skeptical of some extreme DGRP ancestry deviations. The two <lb/>intervals of maximal African ancestry are near Cyp6g1 and overlapping Ace, loci with strong <lb/>selective sweeps related to 20th century insecticide usage [21,22]. At these loci, sweeps <lb/>that occurred after the divergence of the Raleigh population from its European and African <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>source populations (perhaps less than 150 years ago; Keller 2007) could result in biased <lb/>ancestry inference. <lb/>Although it would be desirable to annotate each case in which very recent selective <lb/>sweeps may have influenced ancestry calling, this goal may require significant <lb/>methodological advances. The HMM used here should be more sensitive to cases involving <lb/>very recent selection affecting the European reference panel, but such sweeps could either <lb/>be global (with either the same or different haplotypes fixing in each population), or shared <lb/>by the European and African reference panels but not the DGRP, or specific to the European <lb/>sample. These scenarios each lead to distinct predictions for variation among populations, <lb/>whereas analyses focused only on the European reference panel will mainly pick up sweeps <lb/>that happened prior to American colonization (which are of less concern here). <lb/>This issue reflects a general challenge for ancestry inference. Other reference panel <lb/>approaches should be subject to similar effects of recent selection. Methods that do not use <lb/>reference panels may return non--geographic divisions in the data, such as clustering <lb/>inverted versus standard chromosome arms [20], and even if inverted arms were removed, <lb/>their output could prove similarly uninformative or biased in cases of recent sweeps. <lb/>Hence, the ancestry inferences presented here (Table S3) should be regarded as <lb/>provisional, and should be revisited in light of future methodological developments. <lb/>For either hard sweeps or moderately soft sweeps affecting the European sample, such <lb/>recent selection should increase that population&apos;s haplotype homozygosity, since there has <lb/>been very little time for mutation and recombination since the adaptive event. While such <lb/>a pattern is observed at Cyp6g1, in general the inferred peaks of African ancestry in the <lb/>DGRP show no such pattern (Figure S2). Thus, while recent selection may drive some <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>apparent ancestry deviations, most of the genomic variance in DGRP ancestry suggested in <lb/>Figure 1 may be genuine. <lb/>Admixture in the reference genome <lb/>Using the same methods as described for the DGRP genomes, the D. melanogaster <lb/>reference genome was estimated to have 9.4% African ancestry (Figure 2, Table S4). The <lb/>relatively lesser degree of admixture in this genome, relative to the North Carolina DGRP <lb/>population, would make sense if: (1) this species&apos; initial colonization of the New World <lb/>involved an African founder population in the Caribbean and a European founder <lb/>population in the northeastern U.S. [15,16], and (2) the reference strain descends primarily <lb/>from laboratory stocks obtained by the T. H. Morgan laboratory in New York (as seems <lb/>likely -J. A. Kennison, personal communication). <lb/>The reference genome&apos;s segments of African ancestry are correlated with those found in <lb/>the DGRP (Table 1). And like the DGRP, the reference genome is more likely to carry <lb/>African ancestry in low recombination regions (Table 1). Hence, many of the demographic <lb/>and selective events that molded complex patterns of ancestry in the DGRP may have <lb/>affected other North American populations as well. <lb/>Functional and population genetic correlates of ancestry deviations <lb/>Although precise neutral expectations for interlocus variance in ancestry proportion <lb/>depend on unknown details of the North American colonization scenario, the dramatic and <lb/>non--random variance observed here suggests the possibility that African and European <lb/>alleles at some loci may have had unequal fitness in North American environments. To <lb/></body>

			<body>investigate which types of genes would be the most likely targets of any such selection, <lb/>gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed for intervals of elevated African or <lb/>European ancestry. The GO categories most enriched for European ancestry included <lb/>&quot;circadian behavior&quot;, while those for African ancestry included &quot;flight behavior&quot; and vision--<lb/>related categories (Table 2; Table S2). <lb/>Evidence for widespread epistatic fitness interactions in the DGRP <lb/>The hypothesis that selection may disfavor certain African alleles in the primarily <lb/>European gene pool of the DGRP population is consistent with the above--described <lb/>relationship between recombination rate and ancestry (Figure 3). In light of previous <lb/>evidence [23], at least some of these loci may be involved in interlocus fitness interactions <lb/>(IFIs), in which having African alleles at one locus and European alleles at another may lead <lb/>to reduced survival or fecundity. If natural selection against introgressing African alleles is <lb/>ongoing today, a signal of linkage disequilibrium might be observed between pairs of loci <lb/>responsible for such IFIs. Such analyses have been performed in hybridizing taxa to <lb/>identify pairs of loci that may constitute Bateson--Dobzhansky--Muller incompatibilities of <lb/>potential relevance to speciation [24--27]. <lb/>Here, I test for disequilibrium between loci on different chromosomes, not by using <lb/>individual SNP genotypes, but instead based on the ancestry calls made for each genome in <lb/>each of the 24,417 genomic windows. This focus on &quot;ancestry disequilibrium&quot; (AD) makes <lb/>genome--scale pairwise testing computationally plausible. For each interchromosomal pair <lb/>of windows, I calculated a Fisher&apos;s Exact Test (FET) P value, reflecting the preferential <lb/>occurrence of Africa--Africa and Europe--Europe ancestry combinations at the two windows <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>Only homozygous intervals were analyzed, so each genome has just one allele per locus, <lb/>and inverted chromosome arms were excluded. Results from the true data were then <lb/>compared against randomly permuted data sets, in which individual labels for the second <lb/>window were shifted (thus maintaining the true data&apos;s population ancestry frequencies at <lb/>each window, as well as patterns of linkage between neighboring windows). Across the <lb/>genome, a notable excess of interchromosomal window pairs with low FET P values was <lb/>observed (Figure 4), indicating a genome--wide signal of ancestry disequilibrium. At very <lb/>low P values, the enrichment was more pronounced for X--autosome window pairs than for <lb/>pairs split between the two major autosomes (Figure 4). <lb/>To avoid treating neighboring window pairs as independent, nearby outlier P values <lb/>were merged into two--dimensional &quot;clusters&quot; of ancestry disequilibrium, and these clusters <lb/>were extended from each focal window until pairs with P &lt; 0.05 were no longer observed <lb/>with appreciable frequency. Although the binning criteria were necessarily somewhat <lb/>arbitrary (see Methods), they were designed to extend clusters generously in an attempt to <lb/>fully account for their effect on the genomic distribution of FET P values. Examining the <lb/>chromosomal distribution of these pairwise clusters, there is little evidence that adjacent <lb/>clusters are failing to be appropriately merged (Figure S3). This procedure resulted in 676 <lb/>AD clusters with no pairwise overlap, many of which are likely to represent false positives. <lb/>However, subtracting the entire span of all 676 clusters only accounted for 33% of the <lb/>genome--wide excess of X--autosome FET P values below 0.05, and 58% of the autosome--<lb/>autosome excess. Hence, although further study is needed to accurately estimate the <lb/>number of pairwise IFIs between African and European alleles in the DGRP genomes, based <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>on the present analysis I can not rule out a scenario in which a surprisingly large number of <lb/>pairwise incompatibilities are present. <lb/>Potential genetic targets of interlocus fitness interactions <lb/>The vast number of pairwise comparisons involved in genome--wide disequilibrium <lb/>testing entails a multiple testing problem, with the consequence that no pairwise P value <lb/>from a single hybrid or admixed population is likely to be statistically significant in a <lb/>genome--wide context [27]. Hence, in order to draw any specific conclusions about genes <lb/>causing AD in a single population, additional evidence is needed. With the goal of <lb/>identifying a more confident set of AD clusters, I hypothesized that some true positive loci <lb/>might participate in a greater number of pairwise interactions than expected by chance. <lb/>While a plurality of all genomic windows overlapped zero AD clusters and most windows <lb/>others overlapped three or fewer, a smaller subset of windows overlapped several -up to a <lb/>maximum of 13 pairwise between--chromosome clusters. Comparing the total &quot;cluster <lb/>counts&quot; of windows in the real data against those from permuted data sets, I confirmed that <lb/>windows overlapping multiple pairwise clusters were observed much more frequently <lb/>than expected randomly (Figure S4). For example, windows overlapping 7 or more AD <lb/>clusters were 3.7X more common in the real data (implying a posterior probability of 79% <lb/>that at least some of a window&apos;s pairwise clusters are genuine), and &quot;cluster counts&quot; of at <lb/>least 7 were observed in 59 distinct genomic regions. Windows overlapping 11 or more AD <lb/>clusters were enriched by a factor of 5.2X, indicating a posterior probability of 84%. Hence, <lb/>a subset of windows constituting &quot;AD hubs&quot; have fairly strong confidence of holding <lb/>genuine IFIs, even though data are limited to just one admixed population. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>AD in North American D. melanogaster could indicate IFIs resulting from adaptive <lb/>functional differences between the African and European source populations. For a gene <lb/>where natural selection had acted differently between those two populations, we might <lb/>expect locally elevated FST values between European and West African populations. <lb/>Consistent with this hypothesis, windows overlapping the largest number of AD clusters <lb/>were somewhat more likely to have high FST values between European and West African <lb/>populations (Figure S5). Importantly, FST peaks are typically narrower than AD hubs, so <lb/>their co--occurrence may help to localize the genetic targets of IFIs. <lb/>A thorough analysis of genes likely to underlie IFIs in North American D. melanogaster <lb/>could encompass one or more follow--up studies. Still, a preliminary examination of the <lb/>genes and pairwise combinations involved in AD hubs may motivate hypotheses for further <lb/>genomic and functional testing, regarding the biological nature of putative incompatibilities <lb/>between African and European D. melanogaster. I therefore highlight a few of the most <lb/>notable genes and categories indicated by these AD hubs below. <lb/>Figure 5 illustrates the pairwise components of AD hubs with at least 7 pairwise <lb/>interchromosomal interactions. The most extreme AD hub, overlapping 13 clusters, was <lb/>centered on the gene Argonaute 2 (Figure 6). An RNA interference gene, AGO2 is involved <lb/>in the loading of siRNA onto the RISC complex, and its known functions include antiviral <lb/>response, chromatin silencing, and autophagy. Along with a second AD hub including <lb/>Dicer--2, this result is consistent with the previous finding that RNAi genes are frequent <lb/>targets of positive selection in Drosophila [29]. Another previously implicated target of <lb/>selection is polyhomeotic--proximal (ph--p), which sits within one of just two AD hubs that <lb/>overlap 12 clusters. This polycomb group gene, which has roles in gene silencing, nervous <lb/></body>

			<body>system development, and ecdysone response, was previously shown to have experienced a <lb/>selective sweep in the African ancestral range [30], and may have experienced additional <lb/>adaptation outside Africa as well. <lb/>AD hubs displaying the greatest number of interactions (&gt;11) and elevated FST values <lb/>also included the genes Allatostatin A receptor 1 (AstA--R1; neuropeptide signaling), Fife (a <lb/>recently--described regulator of synaptic transmission [31]), and shaking B (shakB; a <lb/>synaptic gap junction protein involved in phototransduction). Other genes in AD hubs (&gt;7 <lb/>clusters) with elevated Africa--Europe FST values included additional neuropeptide and <lb/>hormone receptors (e.g. the unlinked GABA receptors Rdl, GABA--B--R1, and Grd, along with <lb/>Eip75B, CCAP--R, CCHa1--R, and Lgr1), plus other genes involved in phototransduction <lb/>and/or circadian rhythm (norpA, Pdp1, Rh5), as well as other genes involved in olfaction <lb/>and sensory behavior (Piezo, Spn, the Or65 cluster). A full description of AD hubs and their <lb/>associated interactions is given in Table S5. <lb/>Enriched GO categories for windows in AD hubs with elevated FST (see Methods) echoed <lb/>many of these same themes (Table S6). These categories included &quot;detection of chemical <lb/>stimulus involved in sensory perception&quot; (which had the lowest P value among GO <lb/>categories represented by at least 5 AD hubs), &quot;cellular response to stimulus&quot;, &quot;signal <lb/>transducer activity&quot;, &quot;cell surface receptor signaling pathway&quot;, &quot;intrinsic to membrane&quot;, <lb/>aspects of transmembrane transport, and GABA and allatostatin receptor activities. <lb/>Windows from 35 AD hubs met the FST criteria for this analysis, encompassing a median <lb/>span of just 10 kb per hub. For 27 of these hubs, the window(s) with elevated FST included <lb/>at least one gene from the GO categories mentioned above. This exploratory analysis can <lb/></body>

			<body>not conclusively point to the genes and processes underlying putative incompatibilities in <lb/>the DGRP, but it does suggest hypotheses for downstream molecular and genomic studies. <lb/>Less than a third of pairwise clusters involving AD hubs linked one hub to another <lb/>(Figure 5). While some of these two--hub interactions could make sense based on related <lb/>known functions (e.g. a cluster that links shaking B and Pdp1), other interactions are less <lb/>functionally obvious (e.g. AGO2 with Piezo, and with Rh5). The fitness interactions implied <lb/>by AD need not involve direct molecular interactions; they could instead stem from higher--<lb/>order phenotypes. Still, AD analysis may be fairly unique among evolutionary genomic <lb/>methods in its potential to identify novel functional relationships between genes. This <lb/>signal could complement other genomic searches for interactors, such as correlated rates <lb/>of protein evolution among taxa [32]. But notably, AD can operate on a shorter time scale, <lb/>it only requires data from a single species, and is not confined to interactions between <lb/>protein--coding sequences. <lb/>DISCUSSION: <lb/>Evolutionary history and genetic composition of North American D. melanogaster <lb/>North American strains of D. melanogaster, including the reference genome strain and <lb/>the DGRP, have taken on great importance in a wide range of genetic studies. Previous <lb/>studies had suggested that New World populations are likely to have an admixed history, <lb/>descending from source populations both in Europe and in the sub--Saharan ancestral range <lb/>[12,15]. However, this complex history and dual ancestry, along with its significance for <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>Drosophila research, have not been broadly appreciated in the literature, and efforts to <lb/>study the genetic composition of important fly strains have been lacking. <lb/>In this study, I estimated population ancestry (European or African) along the genomes <lb/>of the reference strain and the DGRP. Results strongly support the hypothesis of admixture <lb/>between these source populations in North America. The larger minority of African <lb/>ancestry in the mid--Atlantic DGRP (20%) versus the northeastern reference genome (9%) <lb/>is consistent with the possibility that an ancestry gradient exists among U.S. populations, <lb/>with greater European ancestry in the north and somewhat higher proportions of African <lb/>ancestry in the south, perhaps as a consequence of secondary contact after two separate <lb/>colonizations. <lb/>An empirical estimate for the generation time of D. melanogaster <lb/>By combining our estimate of the timing of admixture (1,513 generations, based on the <lb/>recombination--mediated shortening of ancestry tracts over time) with historical records on <lb/>the American expansion of D. melanogaster, I can obtain a rough empirical estimate of the <lb/>average generation time of this population. In light of the hypothesized colonization of the <lb/>New World by European strains via the northeast U.S. and by African strains via the <lb/>Caribbean [15,16], one plausible site of initial secondary contact would be in the far <lb/>southeastern U.S. Based on the first observation of D. melanogaster from the southern U.S. <lb/>(1894 in Florida [16]), 109 years would have elapsed before the collection and inbreeding <lb/>of the DGRP strains in 2003. Thus, an estimate of the number of generations per year is <lb/>1,513 / 109 = 13.9. Our estimate of 1,513 generations since admixture carries important <lb/>uncertainties (see Results), as does the precise timing of secondary contact. Furthermore, <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>generation time may vary geographically and temporally based on climate and other <lb/>factors. Temperate populations are known to undergo reproductive diapause in winter <lb/>[33,34]; Raleigh&apos;s climate would seem unfavorable for outdoor reproduction of D. <lb/>melanogaster for roughly three months of the year, whereas other populations may have <lb/>longer or shorter reproductive seasons based on temperature, rainfall, resource <lb/>availability, and other factors. In spite of these caveats, the above estimate may be <lb/>preferable to the commonly used figure of 10 generations per year, for which no empirical <lb/>basis is typically cited. Improving our estimates of this quantity is important, because it <lb/>represents a critical parameter for relating DNA variation and evolution to historical time, <lb/>whether one is studying changes on the scale of months or millions of years. <lb/>Genome--wide evidence for natural selection shaping patterns of admixture <lb/>Three primary patterns in the DGRP ancestry inferences suggest that natural selection <lb/>has powerfully influenced patterns of population ancestry along these genomes. First, <lb/>levels of European and African ancestry vary strikingly within and between chromosome <lb/>arms (Figure 1). Second, the degree of African introgression is greatly reduced in regions <lb/>with higher recombination rates (Figure 3). Third, there is a genome--wide abundance of <lb/>interchromosomal AD locus pairs in which strain ancestries are correlated (Figure 4). <lb/>With regard to the first point, one striking feature of the genomic ancestry landscape is <lb/>the X chromosome&apos;s strongly reduced African introgression relative to the autosomes. This <lb/>result mirrors the situation in sub--Saharan Africa, where admixture from outside Africa is <lb/>lowest on the X [4,35]. X chromosomes may thus be inhibited from introgressing between <lb/>African and non--African populations in either direction. Qualitatively similar patterns have <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>been reported from cases of hybridization involving mice, Neanderthals, and other taxa <lb/>[36--38]. Although the present results concern the admixture of two populations of the <lb/>same species, they are compatible with Haldane&apos;s Rule [39]. They are also concordant with <lb/>the findings of Lachance and True [23], who reported a substantial rate of epistatic fitness <lb/>interactions between X--linked and autosomal loci in crosses involving Canadian and <lb/>Caribbean strains. Haldane&apos;s Rule suggests an elevated contribution of the X chromosome <lb/>to reproductive isolation, potentially involving Bateson--Dobzhansky--Muller <lb/>incompatibilities (BDMIs) in which between--locus combinations of alleles that had never <lb/>co--existed arose following population divergence. A greater effect of BDMIs involving X--<lb/>linked loci could be explained by recessive BDMIs (which are readily exposed in <lb/>hemizygous males), or by a greater density of functional differences between African and <lb/>European populations on the X chromosome, among other potential explanations [40]. <lb/>Patterns of ancestry within chromosome arms further suggest that European and <lb/>African alleles at many loci have had unequal fitness in the DGRP population. Sharp peaks <lb/>of African or European ancestry were apparent. Levels of African introgression into this <lb/>primarily European population were strongly dependent on recombination rate, with much <lb/>less African introgression in higher recombination regions. Part of this signal could result <lb/>from African alleles favored in the DGRP population, with longer linkage blocks hitchhiking <lb/>with them in regions of low recombination. Alternatively, in accord with the X--autosome <lb/>contrast and the ancestry disequilibrium analysis, African alleles at many loci may have <lb/>been selected against in the DGRP population (perhaps due to incompatibilities with <lb/>European alleles at other loci, or else directional selection based on the North Carolina <lb/>environment or the prevalent mating system). In either case, the functional differences <lb/></body>

			<body>between African and European populations acted upon by selection in North America are <lb/>likely to have been products of positive selection in one or both of the source populations. <lb/>The brief evolutionary time scale of these populations&apos; separation (perhaps only ~0.06Ne <lb/>generations [6]) leaves little time for mutation and drift alone to produce such differences. <lb/>Ancestry disequilibrium and its possible causes <lb/>Consistent with the hypothesis of epistatic incompatibilities or other fitness <lb/>interactions between African and European alleles, I found that ancestry disequilibrium is <lb/>widespread in the DGRP genomes and may involve a large number of locus pairs. The <lb/>most obvious explanation for AD is an incompatibility between an African allele at one <lb/>locus and a European allele at another, producing an epistatic fitness interaction due to <lb/>consequences for survival and/or reproductive success. Positive assortative mating -if <lb/>flies with African alleles at certain loci mate preferentially -might also contribute to <lb/>ancestry disequilibrium among wild--caught individuals. Thus, AD could stem from <lb/>interactions between individuals in addition to epistasis within individuals. It is worth <lb/>mentioning, however, that the present study does not directly examine wild--caught flies, <lb/>but instead the genomes of strains that were inbred for 20 generations, and had originated <lb/>from &gt;200 independent isofemale lines. Recessive BDMIs will be unmasked by the <lb/>inbreeding process. Although opportunities for natural selection are limited during <lb/>inbreeding, the success of a full sibling cross might be influenced by the combinations of <lb/>African and European alleles that these individuals possess. Thus, inbreeding and the <lb/>opportunity to study mostly--homozygous genomes may amplify the signal of IFIs and aid <lb/>the search for causative loci. <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>Another recent study that used an inbred Drosophila collection to test for genetic <lb/>incompatibilities within D. melanogaster was by Corbett--Detig et al. [41]. These authors <lb/>used genotyping data from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) [42], <lb/>which consists of more than 1,700 recombinant inbred lines from panels that derive from 8 <lb/>geographically diverse founder strains after 50 generations of interbreeding. Corbett--Detig <lb/>et al. [41] found evidence of interchromosomal allelic associations, concluding that they <lb/>stemmed from incompatibilities segregating within populations. In light of the current <lb/>study, and given the mix of cosmopolitan and sub--Saharan strains in the DSPR, it is also <lb/>possible that some of these incompatibilities had accumulated between populations. <lb/>Examining the 22 SNP pairs identified by that study, none of the corresponding window <lb/>pairs had evidence for AD in the present analysis (P &gt; 0.05 in all cases where African alleles <lb/>existed at both loci), and only 1 of the 44 SNPs was located within an AD hub (a window on <lb/>arm 3R with Europe -West Africa FST of 0.46, upstream of the genes βTub97EF and <lb/>CG4815). However, the 30 autosomal windows containing these SNPs had a median <lb/>ancestry deviation statistic (see Methods) of 5.8% toward European ancestry (Mann--<lb/>Whitney P = 0.0037 comparing these SNPs&apos; ancestry deviations against all other autosomal <lb/>windows). This pattern could indicate that at least some of the SNPs identified by Corbett--<lb/>Detig et al. [41] might be unrelated to Africa--Europe genetic differentiation. Alternatively, <lb/>one could suppose that these DSPR loci were subject to strong epistatic selection (to be <lb/>observed on a short laboratory time scale), and that such alleles might have been purged <lb/>from the DGRP population by now, while AD in the present study may be driven by <lb/>incompatibilities of more moderate effect. More generally, further analysis of the selection <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>coefficients that may drive DGRP ancestry deviations and ancestry disequilibrium, in light <lb/>of nuances such as demographic details and dominance, is warranted. <lb/>Previously, it was shown that one solution to the multiple testing problem inherent in <lb/>genome--wide disequilibrium testing is to add data from a second independent hybrid / <lb/>admixed population and require that both populations show a disequilibrium signal for a <lb/>given pair of loci [27]. Appropriate genomic data is not yet available for such an analysis in <lb/>D. melanogaster, since the admixture tracts found in sub--Saharan populations are still <lb/>impractically long for locus--specific analysis [4]. However, the two--population approach <lb/>could become feasible if a number of strain--specific genomes were sequenced from a <lb/>region such as Saharan Africa, Madagascar [5], northern Australia, or possibly South <lb/>America. The suitability of a population will depend on the timing and amount of <lb/>admixture, and analysis supporting an independent history of admixture relative to North <lb/>America. <lb/>Here, I proposed that without data from a second population, statistical power can be <lb/>gained by focusing on &quot;AD hubs&quot;. Indeed, I found that loci participating in multiple <lb/>pairwise interactions were far more common in the real data than expected for random <lb/>false positives. This step allows the identification of a set of loci with fairly strong <lb/>confidence of contributing to IFIs (e.g. 79% to 84% posterior probabilities), including those <lb/>discussed above. Many of these AD hubs include genes with roles in neurotransmission <lb/>and sensation. It is not possible to infer from the present data what caused fitness <lb/>interactions involving this group of genes, whether it be ecological or reproductive aspects <lb/>of behavior, the maintenance of function in novel thermal environments, or other selective <lb/>pressures. Such hypotheses will ultimately require experimental analysis. <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>It will also be of interest to compare the genomic admixture patterns identified in the <lb/>DGRP to broader latitude clines in eastern North America and elsewhere [43--45], with the <lb/>expectation that many loci subject to ancestry deviations or ancestry disequilibrium in this <lb/>North Carolina sample may show atypical clinal patterns as well. However, such analyses <lb/>should ideally be conducted based on ancestry proportions along the cline, as opposed to <lb/>FST between northern and southern populations. If a latitude gradient in ancestry is <lb/>present, then heterogeneity in north--south FST may simply reflect a ragged genomic <lb/>landscape of genetic differentiation between the African and European source populations. <lb/>Since genomic data from D. melanogaster latitude clines mainly comes from pooled <lb/>sequencing, a method to estimate ancestry proportions from pooled data would allow for <lb/>more robust clinal analysis. <lb/>I have not estimated the precise number of loci contributing to ongoing fitness <lb/>interactions in the DGRP population, and further methological advances toward this goal <lb/>would be desirable. However, the above analyses hint that this number may be substantial. <lb/>Excluding several hundred of the most extreme pairwise interactions did not erase the <lb/>genomic signal of AD. The identification of 59 AD hubs at a 79% confidence level is <lb/>relevant as well, as is the observation that these hubs appear to interact with a larger <lb/>number of partner loci (Figure 5). These findings, together with the pronounced genomic <lb/>variance in ancestry and its correlation with recombination rate, suggest that natural <lb/>selection has profoundly altered the genomic consequences of admixture between <lb/>temperate and tropical populations of D. melanogaster. This work provides an intriguing <lb/>example of admixture between genetically differentiated populations, in a species in which <lb/>large populations may facilitate an important role for natural selection in the genome <lb/></body>

			<body>[46,47]. Importantly, this may also be a system in which putative incompatibilities are <lb/>particularly amenable to functional characterization. <lb/>Significance of mosaic ancestry for Drosophila research <lb/>Being the first and most completely sequenced D. melanogaster genome, the genome of <lb/>the y; cn, bw, sp laboratory strain is typically the standard against which newly sequenced <lb/>genomes from this species are compared. In an evolutionary context, however, this <lb/>genome is not an obvious &quot;reference&quot;, being the result of a complex history involving <lb/>founder events and admixture. The reference genome&apos;s mosaic ancestry may impact <lb/>reference alignments and downstream analyses. Non--African D. melanogaster have <lb/>essentially a subset of the genetic diversity present in sub--Saharan Africa. Thus, a pair of <lb/>non--African genomes will have fewer sequence differences than a pair of sub--Saharan <lb/>genomes or a comparison between these groups. During reference alignment, too many <lb/>SNP or indel differences from the reference genome may cause reads not to map. Thus, <lb/>when the reference carries a European allele, reads from other non--African alleles may <lb/>have a higher probability of mapping than reads from sub--Saharan alleles. This effect may <lb/>depend on the method and parameters used, but could bias population genomic studies of <lb/>individual genomes or pooled samples in ways that are heterogeneous across the genome. <lb/>This problem might be minimized by accounting for known variation during reference <lb/>alignment, or by using a reference genome with similar genetic distances to all strains of D. <lb/>melanogaster (e.g. from Zambia [4]). <lb/>The mosaic ancestry of DGRP and laboratory strains may also be relevant to a range of <lb/>phenotypic and genetic studies. The European and African source populations probably <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>differed in various phenotypes [7]. Some of the phenotypic diversity resulting from their <lb/>admixture may persist today and contribute to the trait variation of populations such as the <lb/>DGRP. As a potential example, variants at many of the AD hub genes mentioned above <lb/>were found to have associations with sleep traits in the DGRP [48], including AlstA--R1, <lb/>βTub97EF, Eip75B, Grd, norpA, the Or65 cluster, Rdl, shaking B, and Spn. It could be <lb/>worthwhile to incorporate ancestry into similar genome--wide association studies. <lb/>Ancestry--associated phenotypic variation might have longer linkage blocks flanking the <lb/>causative sites, potentially making it easier to detect (if this linkage signal could be <lb/>incorporated), but possibly more challenging to localize. In light of the ancestry <lb/>disequilibrium results cited above, admixture could also be a source of epistatic <lb/>interactions in the DGRP and lab strains, which might impact phenotypes of interest and <lb/>contribute to genetic background effects. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <lb/>Genomes and ancestry inference <lb/>Aside from the D. melanogaster reference genome (release 5.57), all genomes analyzed <lb/>here were originally described in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) [1,2] or <lb/>the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP), phase 2 [4]. The alignments used in <lb/>the present study were generated using a common pipeline, involving a second round of <lb/>mapping to a modified reference genome, as described by Lack et al. [46]. <lb/>Ancestry estimation was performed using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach <lb/>originally described by Pool et al. [4]. Briefly, this method utilizes the difference in genetic <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>distance between two types of pairwise comparisons: (1) comparisons among <lb/>&quot;cosmopolitan&quot; genomes from outside sub--Saharan Africa, which have reduced diversity <lb/>stemming from the out--of--Africa bottleneck, and (2) comparisons between sub--Saharan <lb/>and cosmopolitan genomes, which have similarly higher distances as comparisons between <lb/>sub--Saharan genomes. These comparisons are evaluated with the aid of two reference <lb/>panels of genomes (sub--Saharan and cosmopolitan). Distances are initially assessed in <lb/>non--overlapping windows across the genome. In each window for a focal genome being <lb/>tested, its genetic distance to the cosmopolitan panel is tested to evaluate whether it more <lb/>closely resembles the comparisons among cosmopolitan genomes (perhaps indicating <lb/>cosmopolitan ancestry) or the comparison between the sub--Saharan and cosmopolitan <lb/>genomes (favoring sub--Saharan ancestry of the tested genome). A likelihood of each <lb/>ancestry type is obtained for each window for this genome, with the HMM then returning <lb/>final ancestry probabilities in each case. <lb/>Following Lack et al. [49], the sub--Saharan reference panel consisted of 27 Rwanda <lb/>genomes, while the cosmopolitan panel included 9 France and 3 Egypt genomes. <lb/>Chromosome arms with inversions were excluded from reference panels, based on <lb/>evidence that inversions have recently moved between populations [4,20]. Based on the <lb/>relatively older admixture of North American populations (compared with the apparently <lb/>very recent introgression studied in Africa), a somewhat smaller window size was used in <lb/>the present analysis. Windows were scaled by genetic diversity, as defined by 100 non--<lb/>singleton SNPs in the Rwanda sample. In moderate to high recombination regions, these <lb/>windows typically corresponded to 3--5 kb. Otherwise, ancestry was assessed exactly as <lb/>previously described [4,49]. Regions of genomes previously inferred to contain residual <lb/></body>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>heterozygosity or identity by descent with another analyzed genome were excluded from <lb/>all analyses. <lb/>Ancestry deviations and gene ontology enrichment <lb/>Population ancestry proportions among DGRP genomes were found to vary on both <lb/>local and broader genomic scales. To analyze genes that could be responsible for local <lb/>peaks of African or European ancestry, a simple &quot;ancestry deviation&quot; statistic was <lb/>implemented. This statistic was defined as the difference between the proportion of <lb/>African ancestry in the focal window and the median of that quantity in the 51st to 250th <lb/>windows on each side. This procedure helped to account for the regional ancestry <lb/>background while excluding windows that may deviate along with the focal window due to <lb/>the same instance of natural selection. Outlier windows for ancestry deviation were <lb/>defined as based on the 2.5% tails for each chromosomal arm. To avoid double--counting <lb/>the same putative instance of selection, &quot;outlier regions&quot; grouped outlier windows with up <lb/>to two non--outlier windows between them. <lb/>The set of all genes overlapping outlier regions (including the next exon on each side of <lb/>the region) was subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. GO categories <lb/>corresponding to the overlapping genes were counted only once per region. The locations <lb/>of all outlier regions (in terms of the windows that each spanned) were randomly <lb/>permuted within their original chromosome arms 50,000 times, a practice that accounts for <lb/>the effects of varying gene lengths. For each GO category, the proportion of random <lb/>permutations generating at least as many outliers as observed in the real data constituted a <lb/>P value. <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>Ancestry disequilibrium testing and analysis <lb/>Analogous to linkage disequilibrium, I tested for &quot;ancestry disequilibrium&quot; (AD) using <lb/>the ancestry inferred for each genome in each window, asking whether having an African <lb/>allele in one window boosted the chance of having an African allele in an unlinked window. <lb/>Fisher Exact Tests (FETs) were applied to each interchromosomal pair of windows. <lb/>Genomic distributions of FET P values were compared between the real data and permuted <lb/>data sets in which individual labels were consistently shifted for the second window in a <lb/>pair (thus maintaining linkage patterns among windows). Due to the computationally <lb/>intensive analysis, just 10 permuted data sets were assessed, but each one contains roughly <lb/>1 E +8 P values, and consistent results were observed from one replicate to the next. <lb/>To bin multiple neighboring window pairs that could result from the same pair of <lb/>interacting loci, a set of the most extreme AD window pairs were extended to form &quot;AD <lb/>clusters&quot;. Specific criteria for selecting and extending these criteria were as follows. (1) <lb/>Identify each interchromosomal window pair with a raw FET P value below 0.0001 as <lb/>starting points for AD clusters. (2) While holding one member of the focal window pair <lb/>constant, extend the cluster from the other window by advancing in each direction until 10 <lb/>consecutive P values above 0.05 are observed. Repeat to extend bidirectionally from the <lb/>first member of the window pair as well, holding the second member of the window pair <lb/>constant. (3) Consider clusters to encompass the full two--dimensional range of windows <lb/>between the window start and stop positions identified for each side of the pair above. <lb/>Merge any clusters that have overlapping boundaries on both chromosomes, giving the <lb/>merged cluster the maximal span indicated by the boundaries of its component clusters. <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>GO enrichment analysis on AD hubs with elevated Africa--Europe FST [50] was <lb/>conducted as described above for African ancestry deviation, except for the specific criteria <lb/>for outlier regions. Windows were considered to lie within AD hubs if they overlapped at <lb/>least 7 interchromosomal AD clusters, and if their cluster count was within 1 of the local <lb/>maximum (with cluster counts of 4 or below preventing the extension of AD hubs). To <lb/>focus on loci with at least modest evidence for adaptive differences between the source <lb/>populations of North American D. melanogaster, a minimum FST of 0.35 (autosomes) or 0.42 <lb/>(X) was required, corresponding to roughly the upper 15% quantile of this statistic. FST <lb/>was evaluated between a France sample and a panel of four small western African samples <lb/>from Cameroon, Gabon, Guinea, and Nigeria [4]. <lb/></body>

			<body>FIGURE LEGENDS <lb/>Figure 1. The proportion of DGRP genomes that have &gt;50% probability of sub--Saharan <lb/>ancestry in each genomic window is shown for the five major euchromatic chromosome <lb/>arms (color--coded and labeled above). Genomes lacking at least 500 bp of called sequence <lb/>within a given window were excluded, and windows with fewer than 50 genomes meeting <lb/>that criterion were omitted from this plot. <lb/>Figure 2. Sample ancestry likelihood plots from chromosome arm 3L show that the <lb/>proportion of sub--Saharan ancestry depends on geography and inversion status. FR14 is <lb/>part of the non--African reference panel, and shows almost no putative African ancestry. y; <lb/>cn, bw, sp is the D. melanogaster reference genome; it shows peaks of African ancestry <lb/>probability, often on the order of 100 kb. The DGRP genome RAL--239 shows a greater <lb/>density of African ancestry tracts, but of generally similar length as the reference.

			<div type="annex">SUPPORTING INFORMATION CAPTIONS <lb/>Figure S1. The proportion of non--inverted DGRP chromosome arms that have &gt;50% <lb/>probability of sub--Saharan ancestry in each genomic window. Aside from the exclusion of <lb/>inverted chromosome arms, this analysis is identical to that shown in Figure 1. By <lb/>comparison, this plot shows less broad--scale elevation of sub--Saharan ancestry on arm 2L <lb/>(except near the centromere), reflecting the exclusion of genomes carrying In(2L)t and its <lb/>corresponding African ancestry block. Regions of particularly low sub--Saharan ancestry <lb/>are now more apparent on arms 2R and 3R, reflecting the removal of inversions In(2R)Ns <lb/>and In(3R)P, which also have sub--Saharan origin (Corbett--Detig and Hartl 2012). <lb/>Figure S2. Outlier windows for high African ancestry in the DGRP do not generally have an <lb/>excess of identical haplotypes in the non--African reference panel. If the France/Egypt <lb/>panel had experienced very recent selective sweeps (since the species&apos; New World <lb/>colonization), spurious inference of African ancestry would be possible. However, such <lb/>recent selection would be expect to produce long identical haplotypes, which are rare <lb/>across most of the D. melanogaster genome. Above, it can be observed that loci with higher <lb/>African ancestry proportions in the DGRP tend not to have low values for the haplotype <lb/>heterozygosity quantile in the non--African reference panel (the proportion of windows <lb/>with lower or equal haplotype heterozygosity, calculated separately for each autosomal <lb/>arm). This result suggests that most putative peaks of African ancestry are unlikely to be <lb/>an artefact of recent selective sweeps. <lb/></div>

Here, <lb/>the midpoints of each AD cluster linking chromosome arms 2L and 3L are plotted (the pair <lb/>of arms with the greatest number of clusters). If multiple AD clusters were often caused by <lb/>the same underlying AD signal, points in the above plot would often be tightly grouped. <lb/>Although there are isolated cases above where two or more clusters might share the same <lb/>basis, the overall patterns suggests that most AD clusters -whether they represent true or <lb/>false positives -appear to represent distinct signals in the data. Future statistical <lb/>methodological development should target the refinement of two--dimensional AD regions. <lb/>Figure S4. Cumulative enrichment and statistical confidence of ancestry disequilibrium <lb/>hubs are plotted. &quot;Enrichment&quot; (e) refers to the fold--excess of windows overlapping X or <lb/>more clusters in the real data, relative to randomly permuted data sets. Posterior <lb/>probability is calculated as e / (1 + e). Very similar results when windows in low <lb/>recombination regions were excluded (not shown). <lb/>Figure S5. The average FST for windows overlapping 10 or more AD clusters is compared <lb/>to that for all other windows, with the autosomes and X chromosome analyzed separately. <lb/>Here, FST is measuring genetic differentiation between European and western African <lb/>populations, as proxies for the source populations that gave rise to North American D. <lb/>melanogaster. Elevated FST for these hubs is consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive <lb/>functional differences had arisen between the source populations, which may then have <lb/>been subject to interlocus fitness interactions upon secondary contact in the New World. <lb/></div>
