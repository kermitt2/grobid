In some cases, <lb/>these changes may increase offspring fitness but, in others, they can elevate parental <lb/>fitness at a cost to the fitness of their offspring. Here, we show that in Kalahari meerkats <lb/>(Suricata suricatta) the circulating glucocorticoid hormones of pregnant females affect <lb/>the growth and cooperative behaviour of their offspring. We performed a 3-year <lb/>experiment in wild meerkats to test the hypothesis that stress-mediated maternal effects <lb/>reduce the potential for offspring to reproduce directly and therefore cause them to <lb/>exhibit more cooperative behaviour. Daughters (but not sons) born to mothers treated <lb/>with cortisol during pregnancy were smaller early in life and exhibited significantly more <lb/>of two types of cooperative behaviour (pup rearing and feeding) once they were adults <lb/>compared to offspring from control mothers. They also had lower measures of stress <lb/>hormones as they aged, which could explain the observed increases in cooperative <lb/>behaviour. Because early growth is a crucial determinant of fitness in female meerkats, <lb/>our results indicate that stress-mediated maternal effects may reduce the fitness of <lb/>offspring but may elevate parental fitness as a consequence of increasing the <lb/>cooperative behaviour of their daughters. <lb/>Significance Statement <lb/>Maternal characteristics can have a profound influence on offspring, which are referred <lb/>to as maternal effects. It is widely assumed that selfish maternal effects, where mothers <lb/>modify offspring to benefit their own fitness and decrease the fitness of offspring, are <lb/>rare but this assumption is rarely tested. We show that a stress-mediated maternal <lb/>effect in meerkats altered the growth, behaviour, and stress physiology of daughters in <lb/>such a way that benefitted mothers at the expense of their daughters. Daughters from <lb/>stressed mothers grew more slowly early in life, which should reduce their future <lb/>reproductive opportunities, but exhibited more cooperative behaviour that should <lb/>directly benefit their mother. This highlights the important role of sociality in the <lb/>evolution of maternal effects. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Parental effects are a mechanism of trans-generational phenotypic plasticity that <lb/>occurs when the parental phenotype or parental environment modifies offspring <lb/>characteristics (1). Parental effects can increase the survival or reproduction of <lb/>offspring, thereby elevating the direct fitness of both offspring and parents (2-6). <lb/>Alternatively, parental effects can increase parental fitness, but at some cost to the <lb/>fitness of their offspring (7-8) -a process regarded as a type of parental manipulation <lb/>(9-12) or &apos;selfish parental effect&apos; (13). For example, in mammals, the optimal birth weight <lb/>or litter size often differs between mothers and offspring (14) and pregnant females <lb/>experiencing stressful environments may reallocate resources away from offspring and <lb/>towards themselves, so that their offspring are smaller or grow more slowly before <lb/>weaning (15). Despite these observations, it has also been suggested that selfish <lb/>parental effects may be rare and unstable because selection would be expected to <lb/>favour the evolution of resistance mechanisms in offspring (7, 11, 13, 16, 17). <lb/>Selfish parental effects may in fact be more likely in cooperatively breeding <lb/>species where philopatric offspring (subordinates) help to rear the subsequent offspring <lb/>of their parents or other close relatives. This is because parents may gain substantial <lb/>direct fitness benefits from delaying the development of their offspring if this causes <lb/>them to invest in alloparental care directed at the parent&apos;s subsequent offspring (9-10). <lb/>In addition, the costs of selfish parental effects to offspring could be reduced in these <lb/>circumstances, as offspring will gain indirect fitness benefits by contributing to raising <lb/>the subsequent offspring of their parents (18). For example, laboratory studies of <lb/>eusocial insects suggest the possibility that selection will favour the evolution of alleles <lb/>that enable mothers to increase the helping behaviour of their offspring while <lb/>simultaneously reducing their capabilities of reproducing on their own (19-20; but see <lb/>21). In addition, it is often the case that the probability that parents will rear young <lb/>successfully is substantially higher than the probability that inexperienced and <lb/>subordinate females will do so, increasing the inclusive fitness benefits of helping <lb/>versus breeding to offspring (22). <lb/>To date, empirical field tests of how parental effects shape the helping behaviour <lb/>of offspring are rare (23) and studies of selfish parental effects have mostly focused on <lb/>non-social species (13, 24). Here, we report the results of experiments designed to test <lb/>the hypothesis that elevated maternal glucocorticoid (stress hormone) levels reduce the <lb/>potential for offspring to have direct reproductive opportunities and causes them to <lb/>exhibit more cooperative behaviour. In a 3-year field study, we experimentally elevated <lb/>maternal stress by treating pregnant dominant female meerkats with glucocorticoids <lb/>(cortisol) and tracking the growth, stress physiology, and cooperative behaviour of their <lb/>offspring from birth until ~18 months of age, compared to those from control litters. We <lb/>manipulated maternal glucocorticoids because they are known to cause mothers to <lb/>reallocate energy away from offspring and towards themselves (15), indicating that they <lb/>may function as a mediator of selfish maternal effects. Changes in maternal <lb/>glucocorticoids have also previously been shown to delay the dispersal of offspring as <lb/>well as influence the parental care behaviour of offspring (25-26), both traits that are <lb/>important in cooperative breeders where philopatric offspring exhibit alloparental care <lb/>behaviour towards juveniles. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>To identify if the exposure of mothers to heightened glucocorticoids reduced <lb/>reproductive success of their offspring, we examined if offspring from mothers treated <lb/>with cortisol during pregnancy grew slower or were smaller early in life. In meerkats, the <lb/>rate of early life growth and body mass is closely linked to future direct fitness through <lb/>its effects on survival, foraging success, adult body mass (27-29), as well as the <lb/>probability of acquiring dominance (30-31) and other direct reproductive opportunities <lb/>(32). As elevated exposure to maternal glucocorticoids in some mammals may reduce <lb/>offspring size and growth early in life (15), we predicted that offspring from mothers <lb/>treated with cortisol during pregnancy would be smaller early in life and would <lb/>consequently contribute more to cooperative activities than controls. <lb/>Secondly, we determined if offspring from mothers treated with cortisol during <lb/>pregnancy subsequently increased their contributions to two types of cooperative <lb/>behaviours: pup rearing (&quot;babysitting&quot;: 33) and food provisioning during the period when <lb/>the pups are foraging with their natal group but are not yet nutritionally independent <lb/>(&quot;pup feeding&quot;: 34). If offspring from mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy <lb/>exhibit more of either of these two types of alloparental care, this should increase both <lb/>parental fitness and the indirect fitness of offspring because subsequent offspring that <lb/>receive more alloparental care should grow faster or have higher early life survival (27, <lb/>32, 35, 36). <lb/>To assess the mechanism by which elevated exposure to maternal stress may <lb/>affect the alloparental care behaviour of offspring, we repeatedly measured plasma <lb/>cortisol and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations of offspring from <lb/>when they were approximately 1 to 18 months of age to identify how our manipulations <lb/></body>

			<body>affected their neuroendocrine stress axes (glucocorticoid output). Elevated maternal <lb/>glucocorticoids can cause long-term changes in the neuroendocrine stress axis of <lb/>offspring (37) and elevated activity of the neuroendocrine stress axis in meerkats can <lb/>reduce their contributions to alloparental care (38). We therefore predicted that if <lb/>offspring born to mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy exhibited more <lb/>alloparental care behaviour compared to controls, they would also have reduced plasma <lb/>cortisol and fGCM concentrations. <lb/>Results <lb/>Effects of treatments on litter characteristics and offspring survival <lb/>There was no evidence that the treatment of pregnant females with cortisol <lb/>affected their ability to maintain litters to term or the survival of their pups prior to <lb/>emergence from the natal burrow (Tables S1-S2). The number of pups surviving to <lb/>emergence from the natal burrow or 3, 6, or 12 months of age and the litter sex ratio <lb/>were not different among litters from cortisol-treated (31 pups from 10 litters produced <lb/>by 9 dominant females), control (25 pups from 6 litters produced by 6 females), or <lb/>untreated (195 pups from 52 litters produced by 21 dominant females) females (Table <lb/>S1-S2). <lb/>Effects of treatments on offspring early life body mass <lb/>The effects of the treatments on body mass from initial emergence to nutritional <lb/>independence (1-3 months) differed between daughters and sons and depended upon <lb/>the age of offspring (Table S3). Daughters (but not sons) from cortisol treated litters <lb/>were significantly smaller from 1-3 months than those from control litters especially as <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>they approached nutritional independence (daughters: age × treatment, t = -4.17, P &lt; <lb/>0.0001; sons: t = -1.48, P = 0.14), but were of similar body mass compared to those <lb/>from untreated litters (daughters: age × treatment, t = 0.65, P = 0.51; sons: t = -0.52, P <lb/>= 0.6, Table S3, Fig. 1). This difference in body mass between daughters from mothers <lb/>treated with cortisol during pregnancy and those from control litters increased from one <lb/>to three months, as indicated by the significant interaction between age and control <lb/>treatment (Table S3). Daughters, but not sons, from control litters were larger than <lb/>those from untreated litters, especially as they got older (daughters: age × treatment, t = <lb/>-4.24, P &lt; 0.0001; sons: t = 1.35, P = 0.18). <lb/>Effects of treatments on offspring cooperative behaviour <lb/>The effects of the maternal treatments on babysitting behaviour of offspring <lb/>depended upon the age and sex of the offspring (Table S4). Babysitting contributions in <lb/>daughters from mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy slightly, but significantly <lb/>increased and rose more rapidly with increasing age of the babysitter than those from <lb/>control litters (age × treatment, z = -2.89, P = 0.0039) but not untreated litters (age × <lb/>treatment, z = 1.88, P = 0.06; Table S4, Fig. 2). Babysitting contributions in sons from <lb/>mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy showed a similar tendency to slightly <lb/>increase more rapidly with age compared to those from control litters, but this difference <lb/>was not significant (age × treatment, z = -1.92, P = 0.055). Further, age-related <lb/>increases in babysitting contributions between males from mothers treated with cortisol <lb/>during pregnancy and untreated litters did not differ (age × treatment, z = -0.03, P = <lb/>0.97; Table S4, Fig. 2). Comparisons of the magnitude of effect sizes showed that the <lb/>interaction between age and litter treatment had a larger effect on babysitting <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>contributions in daughters but not sons than other variables known to impact babysitting <lb/>contributions, such as foraging success, age-related body mass, or group size (Table <lb/>S4). <lb/>The effects of the maternal treatments on pup feeding depended upon the sex of <lb/>the offspring, but not their age (Table S5). Daughters but not sons from mothers treated <lb/>with cortisol during pregnancy exhibited significantly more pup feeding contributions <lb/>than those from control litters (females: z = -3.12, P = 0.00018; males: z = -1.14, P = <lb/>0.25) or untreated litters (females: z = -3.49, P = 0.0005, sons: z = -1.03, P = 0.3, Table <lb/>S5, Fig. 3). Notably, the magnitude of effect size of litter treatment for daughters was <lb/>much larger than other variables known to impact babysitting contributions such as <lb/>foraging success, age-related body mass, and group size (Table S5). <lb/>Effects of treatments on offspring stress physiology <lb/>Daughters and sons from mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy had <lb/>lower plasma cortisol and fGCM concentrations as they became older compared to <lb/>those from control litters. Plasma cortisol concentrations in daughters from mothers <lb/>treated with cortisol during pregnancy had lower plasma cortisol concentrations as they <lb/>became older compared to those from control litters but these differences were not <lb/>significant (age × treatment, t = -1.61, P = 0.11, Table S6, Fig. 3A). fGCM <lb/>concentrations in daughters were significantly lower than those from control litters as <lb/>they became older (age × treatment, t = -2.95, P = 0 .0033, Table S7, Fig. 4A). Sons <lb/>from mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy had significantly lower plasma <lb/>cortisol concentrations as they became older compared to those from control litters (age <lb/>× treatment t = -2.59, P = 0.01, Table S6, Fig. 3B) but similar fGCM concentrations <lb/>compared to those from control litters as they became older (age × treatment, t = -0.49, <lb/>P = 0.62, Table S7, Fig. 4B). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We found some support for our hypothesis that elevated maternal stress would <lb/>reduce the potential for offspring to have direct reproductive opportunities and would <lb/>therefore shift them towards exhibiting more cooperative behaviour that should increase <lb/>their indirect fitness. Daughters, but not sons, from mothers treated with cortisol during <lb/>pregnancy grew more slowly early in life and exhibited more babysitting and pup <lb/>feeding behaviour as they became older compared to controls. Other than offspring <lb/>survival (Table S2), we were unable to quantify the direct and indirect fitness of <lb/>offspring from control or cortisol-treated litters, but early life growth or body mass (which <lb/>we measured here) is closely linked to direct fitness opportunities in daughters. <lb/>Previous studies in meerkats show that female, but not male, offspring that grow faster <lb/>from 1-3 months are more likely to acquire the dominant breeding position (31), perhaps <lb/>because offspring that grow faster from 1-3 months are heavier later in life (32, 39, 40), <lb/>and heavier females are more likely to acquire a vacant dominant breeding position (30, <lb/>32). As such, daughters, but not sons, from mothers with elevated cortisol levels during <lb/>pregnancy should have reduced future direct fitness opportunities and therefore <lb/>increase their investment in behaviours that elevate their indirect fitness. Our results are <lb/>consistent with studies in other taxa that suggest that individuals adjust their <lb/>contributions to cooperative behaviour according to their future reproductive potential. <lb/>For example, wasps whose probability of acquiring the dominant breeding position was <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>experimentally increased exhibited significantly less helping behaviour (41). Similarly, in <lb/>cooperatively breeding fish, subordinates will reduce their helping investment <lb/>immediately prior to dispersal from their natal group where they attempt to reproduce on <lb/>their own rather than stay in their natal group and queue for dominance (42). <lb/>The effects of maternal stress on offspring should lead to substantial fitness <lb/>benefits to mothers. Daughters from mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy <lb/>exhibited more alloparental care compared to controls, such that subsequent offspring <lb/>produced in groups with offspring from cortisol-treated litters should have received more <lb/>alloparental care behaviours. Because offspring that receive more alloparental care <lb/>grow faster early in life or are larger later in life (32, 39), the presence of offspring from <lb/>cortisol-treated litters should increase the direct fitness of dominant breeders and the <lb/>indirect fitness of the cortisol-treated offspring. Taken together, our results suggest that <lb/>this stress-mediated maternal effect reduced the direct fitness opportunities of <lb/>daughters by reducing their early life growth but they compensated by increasing their <lb/>investment in indirect fitness opportunities (helping to rear non-descendent offspring). <lb/>This is in line with theoretical predictions that parental manipulation of the cooperative <lb/>behaviour of offspring can evolve if the costs of resisting the parental effect are high and <lb/>inclusive fitness benefits of helping rear subsequent offspring are high (18). <lb/>Control dominant females that were fed during pregnancy produced daughters <lb/>that were larger during early development (1-3 months) compared to daughters from <lb/>cortisol-treated or untreated litters. Although mothers that were treated with cortisol <lb/>during pregnancy received the same amount of food as controls, daughters and sons <lb/>from mothers fed cortisol during pregnancy did not differ in body mass compared to <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>those from untreated litters. This indicates that the additional food provided to dominant <lb/>females during pregnancy had the potential to increase growth, but the added cortisol <lb/>prevented those gains in body mass. This has implications for understanding the fitness <lb/>consequences of maternal stress on offspring growth trajectories (15, 43) because our <lb/>results show that elevated circulating glucocorticoid levels in pregnant females in the <lb/>absence of energetic constraints induced reductions in the early life growth of offspring. <lb/>This supports the hypothesis that maternal stress levels during offspring development <lb/>act as a cue that induces plasticity in offspring growth rather than simply mediating the <lb/>effects of energetic constraints. <lb/>The reductions in the activity of the neuroendocrine stress axis of daughters may <lb/>have potentiated the increased alloparental care behaviour that we observed. <lb/>Compared to daughters from control litters, daughters from mothers treated with cortisol <lb/>during pregnancy exhibited more babysitting as they became older, more overall pup <lb/>feeding, and they also had lower plasma cortisol and fGCM concentrations. Males from <lb/>mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy had significantly lower plasma cortisol <lb/>concentrations, but not fGCM concentrations as they got older and also tended to <lb/>exhibit more babysitting as they aged. The activity of the neuroendocrine stress axis is <lb/>closely linked to an array of social behaviours (44) and our recent work shows that <lb/>elevated activity of the neuroendocrine stress axis reduces babysitting in both females <lb/>and males and decreases pupfeeding in females (38). Together, this supports the <lb/>hypothesis that the mechanism by which early life stress increases the cooperative <lb/>behaviour of daughters is by dampening the activity of their neuroendocrine stress axis. <lb/>Our results show that the effects of maternal stress on offspring growth, <lb/>physiology, and behaviour were greater in daughters than in sons, which adds to <lb/>biomedical (45-46) and ecological (47-49) studies that highlight how early life conditions <lb/>or maternal stress levels can have sex-specific consequences for offspring. In <lb/>meerkats, there may be added benefits for the dominant female for altering the <lb/>cooperative behaviour of daughters compared to sons; daughters exhibit more <lb/>cooperative behaviour than sons (35) and are more responsive to the begging calls of <lb/>subsequent offspring that they provision with food (50). More broadly, sex-differences in <lb/>natal dispersal may cause these differential responses to parental effects. In meerkats, <lb/>subordinate males voluntarily disperse from their natal group to look for receptive <lb/>females but can return to their natal group whereas subordinate females rarely <lb/>voluntarily disperse from their natal group (51). In our case and in others (43), the more <lb/>philopatric sex (females) is more sensitive to early life conditions, which may be due to <lb/>differential costs of parental modification between the philopatric and dispersing sex. If <lb/>parental effects have long-term consequences on offspring characteristics, as we show <lb/>here, there may be an increased degree of mismatch between the phenotype of the <lb/>dispersing sex and the postnatal environment where individuals eventually settle. If this <lb/>mismatch has fitness costs, this should select for individuals from the dispersing sex to <lb/>be less responsive to cues from the parental phenotype or environment. <lb/>Our results provide some support for the hypothesis that parents may alter the <lb/>cooperative tendencies of their offspring by manipulating the characteristics of their <lb/>offspring (9-10). Explanations regarding the evolutionary origins of cooperative <lb/>behaviour involve nepotism or kin selection (52), mutualisms or reciprocity (53), but few <lb/>studies have tested the &quot;parental manipulation&quot; hypothesis proposed by Alexander (9). <lb/>Some studies show that alleles that increase maternal fitness at the expense of the <lb/>direct fitness of offspring can evolve (19) and that cooperative breeders may bias <lb/>investment towards offspring that exhibit more cooperative behaviour (54). Our study <lb/>provides evidence that environmental stressors and parental effects can modify the <lb/>cooperative tendencies of their offspring. <lb/>Finally, our results have two implications for theoretical models examining the <lb/>evolution of parental effects. First, given the sex-specificity of parental effects, our <lb/>results challenge the conclusions of models examining the evolution of parental effects <lb/>that assume that all offspring are equally sensitive to the parental effect (16), or those <lb/>that assume that the benefits of exhibiting the phenotype resulting from the parental <lb/>effect are equal for all offspring (18). Second, selfish parental effects are thought to be <lb/>relatively rare (8, 13) and theory (16-17) and empirical studies showing sex-specific <lb/>responses to early life stress (45-46) indicate that offspring can become resistant to <lb/>such selfish parental effects. However, the evolution of selfish parental effects may be <lb/>dependent upon the social environment (24) especially if the selfish parental effect <lb/>influences the expression of alloparental care behaviour of offspring and therefore <lb/>increases the indirect fitness of offspring. Our results provide an example whereby a <lb/>stress-mediated maternal effect reduces the direct fitness of daughters (by reducing <lb/>their early life growth), but presumably increases the direct fitness of mothers and <lb/>indirect fitness of daughters by elevating their cooperative behaviour. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Study site <lb/>We studied free-living meerkats at the Kuruman River Reserve (26° 58&apos; S, 21° <lb/>49&apos; E) in the Northern Cape, South Africa from 2014-2017. Individuals were marked <lb/>uniquely (with PIT tags: Identipet ® , Johannesburg, South Africa) as well as dye marks <lb/>so that they could be identified. Groups were visited for ~4-8 hours per day ~4-6 times <lb/>per week throughout each year of study and sometimes more frequently such as when <lb/>there were pups being babysat. <lb/>Experimental manipulations of dominant females <lb/>Dominant females in each group were identified via behavioural observations <lb/>(55). During each visit, we recorded which individuals were present as well as their body <lb/>mass. Meerkats were weighed on a portable balance each morning before foraging, 2-4 <lb/>hrs after foraging was initiated, and immediately prior to when foraging ended (56). The <lb/>pregnancy status of dominant females was determined visually (distended abdomen) as <lb/>well as noting a constant increase in their body mass. <lb/>Dominant females were treated with either a cortisol solution or a control oil <lb/>vehicle when they were pregnant by feeding them food containing one of these two <lb/>treatments. We initially offered experimental animals hard boiled egg with added cortisol <lb/>but found that they rejected all foods that contained added cortisol with the exception of <lb/>scorpions. We consequently fed experimental females with cortisol (10 mg/kg of <lb/>hydrocortisone, Sigma H4126), that were dissolved in 100 µl of 100% coconut oil and <lb/>injected into a dead scorpion (Opistophthalmus spp.). Control females were fed a dead <lb/>scorpion that was injected with 100 µl of 100% coconut oil. A previous study using the <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>same protocol showed that meerkats that were fed cortisol had significantly higher <lb/>plasma cortisol and fGCM concentrations than control animals and these increases <lb/>were within a biologically-relevant range (38). This indicated that our treatment causes <lb/>the exogenous glucocorticoids that we feed the meerkats to enter their bloodstream and <lb/>leads to sustained increases in their circulating glucocorticoid concentrations. <lb/>We aimed to experimentally increase the glucocorticoid concentrations of <lb/>pregnant dominant females from when they were first confirmed to be pregnant (second <lb/>half of gestation) until parturition. Meerkats have a ~70 d gestation period so we aimed <lb/>to treat them with glucocorticoids from approximately 35-70 d during gestation. In <lb/>reality, females that successfully produced a litter where pups emerged from the natal <lb/>burrow were treated with cortisol for 12-36 days prior to birth (n=10 litters from 9 <lb/>females, mean = 23.7 d, median = 23.5 d) whereas controls were fed for 12-58 d prior <lb/>to birth (n=6 litters from 6 females, mean = 30 d, median = 20.5 d). <lb/>Females were randomly allocated to the treatments. Across the three years of <lb/>this study, we produced a total of 16 cortisol-treated or control litters produced by 12 <lb/>dominant females in 12 different social groups. Three of the females experienced both <lb/>the control and cortisol treatments at different time points of the experiment, whereas <lb/>one female experienced the control treatment once and the cortisol treatments twice. <lb/>For these latter females treated twice, the order of treatments was randomly selected. <lb/>We conducted these experiments over the course of three years: 13 litters from 10 <lb/>females in 2014 (April-December 2014, 3 litters aborted), 5 litters from 5 females in <lb/>2015 (February-July 2015, 1 litter aborted), and 3 litters from 3 females in 2016 (July <lb/>2016). <lb/>To provide an additional comparison group to investigate how our treatments (fed <lb/>during pregnancy or fed cortisol during pregnancy) affected offspring survival, body <lb/>mass, and cooperative behaviour, we also monitored these traits in offspring produced <lb/>by dominant females that were untreated during pregnancy (n = litters from 21 <lb/>dominant females). For our analyses of how the treatments affected offspring survival <lb/>and body mass, the untreated offspring were those from litters produced by dominant <lb/>females in other meerkat groups in our same study area and were born during our study <lb/>(hereafter called &apos;untreated&apos; litters). We assessed the contributions of offspring from <lb/>mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy to two cooperative behaviours <lb/>(babysitting and pup feeding) compared to those from control litters but also to other <lb/>group members from untreated litters. We did not have data from offspring from <lb/>untreated litters when we assessed how our treatments affected their plasma cortisol or <lb/>fGCM concentrations. <lb/>Quantifying early life growth of offspring <lb/>Meerkat pups typically first emerge from their natal burrow approximately 21-30 d <lb/>after birth. Meerkat groups and dominant females were monitored daily around the <lb/>estimated date of parturition and birth dates were estimated according to the change in <lb/>the physical appearance of the dominant female, a large drop in body mass overnight, <lb/>and group members exhibiting babysitting behaviour at the sleeping burrow. Burrows <lb/>containing pups were monitored each day and, when pups emerged, they were uniquely <lb/>marked by trimming small sections of hair before permanent PIT tags could be applied. <lb/>Pups were weighed each time we visited the groups on a portable balance in the <lb/>morning after group members emerged from their sleeping burrow (as above). <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>Quantifying cooperative behaviour of offspring <lb/>We measured the babysitting (controls: 195-655 d; cortisol: 184-655 d; untreated: <lb/>155-655 d) and pup feeding (controls: 220-635 d; cortisol: 184-655 d; untreated: 155-<lb/>626 d) contributions of offspring from cortisol-treated and control litters when they were <lb/>&gt;6 months of age until death or disappearance. We visited sleeping burrows containing <lb/>pups every day in the morning and recorded the identity of the attending babysitters. As <lb/>we have done previously (33, 57), we calculated relative babysitting contributions of <lb/>each individual meerkat for each litter by dividing the total number of days an individual <lb/>babysat a litter over the total number of days that this specific litter had a babysitter. <lb/>Pup feeding behaviour for each pup produced by the dominant females in the different <lb/>treatment groups was estimated using ad libitum sampling (34). When the social group <lb/>contained pups (up to 90 d of age), we recorded all pup-feeding events, which are <lb/>visually and acoustically conspicuous to observers (58). We used the probability of pup <lb/>feeding occurring and corrected for variation in observation time (see below). <lb/>Quantifying plasma cortisol concentrations from offspring <lb/>We obtained plasma samples from offspring from cortisol-treated and control <lb/>litters approximately every 3 months from first emergence from the burrow (~1 month) <lb/>until ~18 months of age (controls: 20-548 d; cortisol-treated: 25-559 d). Capture and <lb/>blood processing procedures are described elsewhere (59-60). We measured total <lb/>plasma cortisol concentrations using a previously validated assay (Coat-a-Count, <lb/>Siemens Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, USA: validation described in <lb/>59). The sensitivity of the assay was 1.9 ng/ml and cross reactivity to other hormones <lb/>was 76% with prednisolone, 11.4% with 11-deoxycortisol, 2.3% with prednisone and <lb/></body>

			<body>&lt;1% with aldosterone, corticosterone, cortisone, estriol, estrone and pregnenolone. <lb/>Intra-assay coefficient of was 7% (n = 20 samples). Inter-assay coefficient of variation <lb/>for a low control was 8% (78.5 ± 6.3 nmols/l, n = 5 assays) and 2.8% for a high control <lb/>(187 ± 5.3 ng/ml, n = assays). <lb/>Quantifying fGCM concentrations from offspring <lb/>We collected faecal samples from offspring from cortisol-treated and control <lb/>litters opportunistically during behavioural observations over the course of the study <lb/>(controls: 25-356 d; cortisol-treated: 32-326 d). Faecal samples were processed as <lb/>described previously using a methanol extraction to remove fGCMs (61-62). <lb/>Immunoreactive fGCM concentrations were determined using an enzyme immunoassay <lb/>measuring cortisol metabolites with a 5β-3α,11β-diol-structure (11β-<lb/>hydroxyetiocholanolone) already established for monitoring fGCM alterations in <lb/>meerkats (62). fGCMs measured reflect average adrenal cortisol production over the <lb/>previous ~24 to 48 hr period (62). Detailed assay characteristics, including full <lb/>descriptions of the assay components and cross-reactivities, are found elsewhere (63) <lb/>The sensitivity of the assay was 1.2 ng/g dry weight and intra-assay coefficients of <lb/>variation (CV) determined by repeated measurements of high and low value quality <lb/>controls were 6.9% and 7.4%, respectively, and inter-assay CV values were 11.5% and <lb/>15.9% (n = 29 assays). fGCM concentrations below are expressed as ln ng/g dry faecal <lb/>matter. <lb/>Statistical analyses <lb/>We used generalized (binomial errors) or linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to <lb/>examine how our treatments affected the probability that the litter was aborted, litter size <lb/>and sex ratio at emergence from the burrow, and the proportion of the litter that survived <lb/>to emergence from the burrow, independence (90 d of age: 29), and 6 or 12 months of <lb/>age. We focused on addressing whether the cortisol-treated litters differed from our <lb/>control or untreated litters. These models included a fixed effect for date of birth of the <lb/>litter and random intercept terms for dominant female identity and year (as the <lb/>experiments were conducted over 3 years). None of the GLMMs were overdispersed <lb/>(Table S2). <lb/>We used a LMM to investigate how the maternal treatments affected offspring <lb/>body mass from first emergence from their natal burrow (~1 month) to 3 months of age <lb/>when the pups are typically foraging independently (29, 34). Morning body mass (in <lb/>grams) was the response variable with the fixed effects of maternal treatment (cortisol-<lb/>treated, control, or untreated), pup sex, pup age, litter size at burrow emergence, group <lb/>size, group size 2 , total rainfall in the previous 60 days, two measures of seasonality <lb/>(sine and co-sine functions of day of weight measure: see 56), and two three-way <lb/>interactions between sex, treatment, age or age 2 . Random intercept terms for year and <lb/>the identity of the individual nested in litter, nested in dominant female identity, nested in <lb/>group were also included in this model. Fixed and random effects included in these <lb/>models were based upon previous studies investigating meerkat body mass and growth <lb/>from 1-3 months (28, 31, 56). Only individuals that survived to 90 d were included in <lb/>these analyses. <lb/>We assessed how the treatments affected the relative babysitting and pup <lb/>feeding contributions of subordinates when they were &gt;6 months (as they rarely do <lb/>alloparental care behaviour &lt;6 months: 35) from cortisol-treated, control, and untreated <lb/></body>

			<body>litters. In these generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM, binomial errors), we <lb/>included a three-way interaction between treatment, sex, and age of the subordinate to <lb/>assess if the effects of the treatments on babysitting or pup feeding varied according to <lb/>the sex or age of the subordinate, as contributions to cooperative behaviour in meerkats <lb/>are known to vary according to subordinate sex and age (35). To account for <lb/>differences in observation time, we included a co-variate for the number of days the <lb/>litter was babysat (babysitting length) and the number of days the subordinate was <lb/>observed in the group during babysitting as well as the total time spent observing the <lb/>group during pup feeding (observation time). We included a range of co-variates (see <lb/>Tables S4-S6) that have been previously documented to affect contributions to <lb/>babysitting and pup feeding, including age, foraging success, body mass, and group <lb/>size (Clutton-Brock et al., 2000, 2002, 2003; Carlson et al., 2006a; Dantzer et al., <lb/>2017a). Relatedness between the subordinate and the litter being babysat was not <lb/>included as it has not been shown to impact babysitting or pup feeding contributions <lb/>(27, 57) and most of the litters in our entire dataset were produced by the mother or full <lb/>sibling of the subordinate. Random intercept terms for year and the identity of the <lb/>individual, and litter being babysat or pup fed nested within the group where the litter <lb/>was being babysat or pup fed. Overdispersion was not an issue for our GLMM for <lb/>babysitting as indicated by the goodness of fit test (Pearson c 2 = 147.1, df = 154, P = <lb/>0.64, using package aods3: 64) but our GLMM for pup feeding was initially <lb/>overdispersed (Pearson c 2 = 310, df=165, P &lt; 0.0001) so we included an observation <lb/>level random intercept term. <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>We used two separate LMMs to assess how our manipulations affected plasma <lb/>cortisol and fGCMs in offspring from cortisol-treated and control litters. Each model <lb/>included fixed effects for maternal treatment, pup sex and age, time of day and year that <lb/>the sample was acquired (2014 or 2015), and random intercept terms for identity of <lb/>individual nested in their birth litter and group. In the model for plasma cortisol <lb/>concentrations, we also included a linear and second order fixed effect for the time it <lb/>took to acquire the blood sample to control for any variation in plasma cortisol <lb/>concentrations due to restraint stress (60). Year was included as a fixed effect here <lb/>because we only had samples from two separate years. We included covariates <lb/>associated with the individual meerkat and weather or social group characteristics that <lb/>are known to affect plasma cortisol (60) or fGCM (62) concentrations (see Tables S6-<lb/>S7). <lb/>We used R (version 3.4.3: 65) for all of our statistical analyses. R package lme4 <lb/>(version 1.1-14: 66) was used for LMMs and P values were estimated using lmerTest <lb/>(version 2.0-33: 67). A graphical approach was used to confirm normality and <lb/>homoscedasticity of residuals and to confirm there were no observations with high <lb/>leverage (68). All continuous variables were standardized to a mean of 0 and SD of 1. <lb/>Ethics: All protocols used in our experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics <lb/>Committee at the University of Pretoria (Pretoria, South Africa: #EC031-13, #EC047-16) <lb/>and the Northern Cape Department of Environment and Nature Conservation Research <lb/>(South Africa: FAUNA 050/2013, FAUNA 192/2014, FAUNA 1020/2016). <lb/></body>
