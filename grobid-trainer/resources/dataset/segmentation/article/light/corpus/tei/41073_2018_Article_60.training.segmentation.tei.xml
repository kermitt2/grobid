			<body>Background <lb/>Scientists and various news platforms have, over the last <lb/>few years, increasingly been speaking of a replication cri-<lb/>sis in various academic disciplines, especially the bio-<lb/>medical 1 and social sciences. 2 The main reason for this <lb/>is that it turns out that large numbers of studies cannot <lb/>be replicated, that is (roughly), they yield results that ap-<lb/>pear not to support, or to count against, the validity of <lb/>the original finding. 3 This has been and still is an im-<lb/>portant impulse for composing and adapting various <lb/>codes of research integrity. Moreover, in December <lb/>2017, the National American Academies convened the <lb/>first meeting of a new study committee that will, for a <lb/>period of 18 months, study &quot;Reproducibility and Replic-<lb/>ability in Science,&quot; a project funded by the National Sci-<lb/>ence Foundation. 4 Finally, over the last few years, <lb/>various official reports on replication have been pub-<lb/>lished. At least five of them come to mind: <lb/>The 2015 report by the National Science <lb/>Foundation: Social, Behavioral, and Economic <lb/>Sciences Perspectives on Robust and Reliable Science <lb/>The 2015 symposium report by the Academy of <lb/>Medical Sciences: Reproducibility and Reliability of <lb/>Biomedical Research <lb/>The 2016 workshop report by the National <lb/>Academies of Sciences: Statistical Challenges in <lb/>Assessing and Fostering the Reproducibility of <lb/>Scientific Results [1] <lb/>The 2016 report by the Interacademy Partnership <lb/>for Health: A Call for Action to Improve the <lb/>Reproducibility of Biomedical Research <lb/>The 2018 advisory report by the Royal Netherlands <lb/>Academy of Arts and Sciences Replication Studies 5 <lb/>These documents state what the problem regarding <lb/>replication is, they explain how we should think of the <lb/>nature and value of replication, and they make various <lb/>recommendations as to how to improve upon replicabil-<lb/>ity. There are many causes for lack of replicability and <lb/>failure to successfully replicate upon attempting to do <lb/>so. Among them are (i) fraud, falsification, and plagiar-<lb/>ism, (ii) questionable research practices, partly due to <lb/>unhealthy research systems with perverse publication in-<lb/>centives, (iii) human error, (iv) changes in conditions <lb/>and circumstances, (v) lack of effective peer review, and <lb/>(vi) lack of rigor. 6 Thus, we also need a wide variety of <lb/>measures to improve on replicability.

			<body>will take each of the reports mentioned above into con-<lb/>sideration, but pay special attention to the KNAW re-<lb/>port, since it is the most recent one and it has taken the <lb/>findings of the other reports into account. <lb/>The issue of replicability and replication in academic <lb/>research is important for various reasons. Let me men-<lb/>tion four of them: (i) results that are consistently repli-<lb/>cated are likely to be true, all else being equal, that is, <lb/>controlling for such phenomena as publication bias and <lb/>assuming that the other assumptions in the relevant the-<lb/>ory or model are valid, (ii) replicability prevents the <lb/>waste of (financial, time, etc.) resources, since studies <lb/>that cannot be consistently replicated are less likely to <lb/>be true, (iii) results that are not replicable are, if they are <lb/>applied, more likely to cause harm to individuals, ani-<lb/>mals, and society (e.g., by leading to mistaken economic <lb/>measures or medicine that is detrimental to people&apos;s <lb/>health), and (iv) if too many results turn out not to be <lb/>replicable, upon attempting to replicate them, that will <lb/>gradually erode public trust in science. 7 <lb/>Now, reports about replication focus on various quan-<lb/>titative empirical sciences. 8 The KNAW Advisory Re-<lb/>port, for instance, makes explicit that it is confined to <lb/>the medical sciences, life sciences, and psychology. 9 <lb/>These reports, though invite researchers from other dis-<lb/>ciplines to consider the relevance of these documents <lb/>and recommendations for their own fields. That is pre-<lb/>cisely the purpose of this paper: to explore to what ex-<lb/>tent replication is possible and desirable in another <lb/>important field of scholarly activity, namely the human-<lb/>ities. After all, many humanistic disciplines, such as his-<lb/>tory, archeology, linguistics, and art theory are <lb/>thoroughly empirical: they are based on the collection of <lb/>data (as opposed to the deductive lines of reasoning that <lb/>we find in mathematics, logic, parts of ethics, and <lb/>metaphysics). This naturally leads to the question <lb/>whether replication is also possible in the humanities. <lb/>How we should think of replication in the humanities <lb/>is something that has not received any attention so far, <lb/>except for a couple of articles that I co-authored with <lb/>Lex Bouter. 10 Maybe this is because it is questionable <lb/>whether replication is even possible in the humanities. <lb/>There are various reasons for this. First, the study ob-<lb/>jects in the humanities are often unique phenomena, <lb/>such as historical events, so that it is not clear in what <lb/>sense one could replicate a study. Second, one might <lb/>think that various methods in the humanities, such as <lb/>the hermeneutical method in studying a text, do not <lb/>lend themselves well to replication-at least not as well <lb/>as certain methods in the quantitative empirical sci-<lb/>ences, where one can carry out an experiment with simi-<lb/>lar data under similar circumstances. Third, the objects <lb/>of humanistic research, in opposition to the objects of <lb/>research in the natural sciences, are often object with <lb/>meaning and value, objects such as paintings, texts, <lb/>statues, and buildings-in opposition to, say, such ob-<lb/>jects as atoms and viruses that are studied in the natural <lb/>sciences. One might think that the inevitably normative <lb/>nature of these humanistic objects makes replication im-<lb/>possible. It remains to be seen, though, whether these <lb/>objections hold water. I return to each of them below. <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>In order to answer the question of whether replication is <lb/>possible and, if so, desirable in the humanities, I first <lb/>create more conceptual clarity by defining, in addition <lb/>to the term &quot;humanities,&quot; various key terms in the de-<lb/>bate on replication, such as &quot;reproduction&quot; and &quot;replic-<lb/>ability.&quot; In doing so, I pay attention to what is supposed <lb/>to be the object of replication: certain studies, particular <lb/>inferences, of specific results. After that, I lay out three <lb/>reasons for thinking that replication in the humanities is <lb/>not possible and argue that they are unconvincing. <lb/>Subsequently, I give a more detailed case for thinking <lb/>that replication in the humanities is possible. Finally, I <lb/>explain why such replication in the humanities is not <lb/>only possible, but also desirable. <lb/>Defining the key terms <lb/>We can be rather brief about the term &quot;humanities.&quot; <lb/>There is a debate on what should count as a humanistic <lb/>discipline and what not. Rather than entering that de-<lb/>bate here, I will simply stipulate that, for the sake of ar-<lb/>gument, I take the following disciplines to belong to the <lb/>humanities: anthropology; archeology; classics; history; <lb/>linguistics and languages; law and politics; literature; the <lb/>study of the performing arts, such as music, theater, and <lb/>dance; the study of the visual arts, such as drawing, <lb/>painting, and film; philosophy; theology; and religious <lb/>studies. This captures what most people take to fall <lb/>under the umbrella of &quot;humanities&quot; and that will do for <lb/>the purposes of this paper. 11 <lb/>Let us now move on to replication. There are at least <lb/>two complicating factors when it comes to the issue of <lb/>replication in the humanities: there is a wide variety of <lb/>terms and many of these terms have no definition that is <lb/>widely agreed upon. I have the following eight terms in <lb/>mind: &quot;replication study,&quot; &quot;replicability,&quot; &quot;replication,&quot; <lb/>&quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;reproducibility,&quot; &quot;robustness,&quot; &quot;reliabil-<lb/>ity,&quot; and &quot;verifiability.&quot; Here, I will put the final three <lb/>terms, namely &quot;robustness,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; and &quot;verifiabil-<lb/>ity&quot; aside, since the points I want to make about replica-<lb/>tion in the humanities do not depend on them. 12 Also, I <lb/>take &quot;replication&quot; and &quot;reproduction&quot; to be synonyms, as <lb/>I do &quot;replicability&quot; and &quot;reproducibility.&quot; 13 I will, there-<lb/>fore, focus on the three remaining terms, to wit &quot;replica-<lb/>tion studies,&quot; &quot;replicability,&quot; and &quot;replication.&quot; <lb/>Let us define &quot;replication study&quot; as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>Replication study <lb/>A replication study is a study that is an independ-<lb/>ent repetition of an earlier, published study, using <lb/>sufficiently similar methods (along the appropriate <lb/>dimensions) and conducted under sufficiently similar <lb/>circumstances. 14 <lb/>Clearly, this definition requires some explanation. <lb/>First, it counts both studies that are meant as close or <lb/>exact replication and studies designed as conceptual rep-<lb/>lication as replication studies. There are, of course, cru-<lb/>cial differences between these kinds of replication, but <lb/>they both count as replication studies and that is exactly <lb/>what the above definition is meant to capture. A recent <lb/>call for replication studies by the Netherlands <lb/>Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), for in-<lb/>stance, distinguishes three kinds of replication 15 : <lb/>1. Replication with existing data and the same <lb/>research protocol and the same research question: <lb/>repeated analysis of the datasets from the original <lb/>study with the original research question <lb/>(sometimes more narrowly referred to as a <lb/>&quot;reproduction&quot;). <lb/>2. Replication with a new data collection and with the <lb/>same research protocol and the same research <lb/>question as the original study (often referred to as a <lb/>&quot;direct replication&quot;). <lb/>3. Replication with new data and with a new or revised <lb/>research protocol 16 : new data collection with a <lb/>different design from the original study in which <lb/>the research question remains unchanged compared <lb/>to that of the original study (often referred to as a <lb/>&quot;conceptual replication&quot;). 17 <lb/>An advantage of the above definition of &quot;replication <lb/>study&quot; is that it captures these three varieties of replica-<lb/>tion studies. It is, of course, perfectly compatible with <lb/>my definition to make these further distinctions among <lb/>varieties of replication studies. <lb/>Second, the definition states that the new study should <lb/>in some sense be independent from the original study. <lb/>Unfortunately, reports on replication usually do not de-<lb/>fine what it is for a study to be independent from an <lb/>earlier one. 18 It seems to me that the right way to under-<lb/>stand &quot;independence&quot; here is that the new study should <lb/>not in any way depend on the results of the original <lb/>study. <lb/>However, can we be more precise about how the re-<lb/>sults of the new study should not depend on those of <lb/>the original study? The most obvious meaning of this <lb/>phrase is that the new study should not take all the ori-<lb/>ginal results for granted-that is, it should not assume <lb/>their truth or correctness in its line of reasoning (even <lb/>though, it can of course do so merely for the sake of ar-<lb/>gument). Dependence, however, is a matter of degree: <lb/>one can, for instance, assume certain results or certain <lb/>aspects of certain results in order to replicate other re-<lb/>sults or other aspects of results. Below, we return to the <lb/>issue of degrees when we consider in what sense results <lb/>of the new study should agree with the results of the ori-<lb/>ginal study. <lb/>This means that various other kinds of dependence are <lb/>perfectly legitimate for a replication study. For example, <lb/>the new study can depend on the same instruments as <lb/>those used in the original study, on the same research <lb/>protocol (e.g., in a repetition of an earlier study), and, in <lb/>some cases, even on the original researchers or at least <lb/>partly so in the case of a collaborative team with the ori-<lb/>ginal researchers and new researchers. It can perfectly <lb/>well depend on these things in that it is no problem if <lb/>the original study and the new study have the same in-<lb/>struments, the same research protocol, and consists of <lb/>the same group of researchers-at least for some kinds <lb/>of replication. <lb/>Third and finally, the definition states that the methods <lb/>used and the circumstances in which the study is carried <lb/>out should be &quot;sufficiently similar.&quot; That means that they <lb/>need not be identical-that may be the case (or something <lb/>very close to that), but that is not required for a replication <lb/>study. It also means that they should not be completely <lb/>different-that is excluded by its being a replication study. <lb/>But exactly when are they &quot;sufficiently similar?&quot; <lb/>This is a complex issue that others have addressed in <lb/>detail. For instance, Etienne LeBel and others provide a <lb/>replication taxonomy that understands replication as a <lb/>graded phenomenon: it ranges from an exact replication <lb/>(all facets that are under the researchers&apos; control are the <lb/>same) to a very far replication (independent variables <lb/>(IV) or dependent variables (DV) constructs are differ-<lb/>ent), with, respectively, very close replication, close repli-<lb/>cation, and far replication in-between. The design facets <lb/>that their taxonomy pays attention to are such things as <lb/>effect or hypothesis, IV construct, DV construct, opera-<lb/>tionalization, population (e.g., seize), IV stimuli, DV <lb/>stimuli, procedural details, such as task instructions and <lb/>font size, physical setting, and contextual variables (they <lb/>indicate that the list can be extended). 19 What this goes <lb/>to show is that replication is a matter of degree and that <lb/>in assessing the epistemic status of a replication, one <lb/>should try to locate it on a replication continuum. <lb/>This brings us to the second key term, &quot;replicability.&quot; <lb/>It seems to me that this term is used in two crucially dif-<lb/>ferent ways, in the KNAW Advisory Report as well as in <lb/>the broader literature on replication studies. In order to <lb/>keep things clear, I would like to distinguish the two and <lb/>will refer to the former as &quot;replicability&quot; and to the latter <lb/>as &quot;replication.&quot; I define them as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>Replicability <lb/>A study is having certain features such that a repli-<lb/>cation study of it could be carried out. <lb/>Replication <lb/>A study is being such that a repetition of it has suc-<lb/>cessfully been carried out, producing results that <lb/>agree with the original study. 20 <lb/>Some philosophers of science and scholars in research <lb/>integrity use the term &quot;transparency&quot; for what I dub <lb/>&quot;replicability&quot; here. 21 Clearly, replicability, as I under-<lb/>stand it here, has much to do with transparency: a study <lb/>can be replicated only if the researchers are sufficiently <lb/>transparent about the data, the method, the inferences, <lb/>and so on. Still, I prefer to use the term &quot;replicability&quot; ra-<lb/>ther than &quot;transparency,&quot; given the purposes of this <lb/>paper. This is because some humanistic scholars, as we <lb/>shall see below, think that studies can be perfectly trans-<lb/>parent and yet such that they cannot be replicated. If so, <lb/>they are not replicable, but not because of any scholarly <lb/>shortcoming. Rather, it would be the nature of the beast <lb/>(a humanistic study, or a particular kind of humanistic <lb/>study, such as one about value or meaning) that prevents <lb/>the possibility of replication. <lb/>Thus, replicability is a desideratum for at least many <lb/>studies in the quantitative empirical sciences (I return to <lb/>the humanities below): we want them to be set-up and <lb/>described in such a way that, in principle, we could carry <lb/>out a replication study. Precise definitions, a clear de-<lb/>scription of the methodology (in the research protocol), <lb/>a clear overview of the raw data, a lucid analysis of the <lb/>data, and so on, all contribute to the replicability of a <lb/>study. One of the things the replication crisis has made <lb/>clear is that many studies in the empirical sciences fail <lb/>to meet the criterion of replicability: we cannot carry <lb/>out a replication study of them, since the key terms are <lb/>not even sufficiently clearly defined, the method is <lb/>underdescribed, the discussion is not transparent, the <lb/>raw data are not presented in a lucid way, or the analysis <lb/>of the data is not clearly described. <lb/>Replicability should be clearly distinguished from repli-<lb/>cation. Replication entails replicability (you cannot repli-<lb/>cate what is not replicable), but requires significantly <lb/>more, namely that a successful replication has actually <lb/>taken place, producing results that agree with the results <lb/>of the original study. Thus, in a way this distinction is <lb/>similar to Karl Popper&apos;s famous distinction between fal-<lb/>sifiability and falsification. 22 Falsifiability is a desider-<lb/>atum for any scientific theory: very roughly, a theory <lb/>should be such that it is in principle falsifiable. Falsifica-<lb/>tion entails falsifiability, but goes a step further, because <lb/>a falsified theory is a theory that is not only falsifiable, <lb/>but that has in fact also been falsified. I said &quot;roughly,&quot; be-<lb/>cause, as Brian Earp has argued in more detail, things are <lb/>never so simple when it comes to falsification: even if an <lb/>attempt at falsification has taken place and the new data <lb/>seem to count against the original hypothesis, one might <lb/>often just as well, say, question an auxiliary assumption, <lb/>consider whether a mistake was made in the original <lb/>study, or wonder whether perhaps the original effect is a <lb/>genuine effect but one that can only be obtained under <lb/>specific conditions. 23 Nevertheless, falsification is often <lb/>still considered as a useful heuristic in judging the <lb/>strength of a hypothesis. 24 Now, the obvious difference <lb/>with the issue at hand is that, even though both falsifiabil-<lb/>ity and replicability are desiderata, replication is a good <lb/>thing, because it makes it, all else being equal, likely that <lb/>results are true, whereas falsification is in a sense a bad <lb/>thing, because it makes it likely that a theory is false. 25 <lb/>A replication study, then, is a study that aims at replica-<lb/>tion. Such replication may fail either because the original <lb/>study turns out not to be replicable in the first place or be-<lb/>cause, even though it is replicable, a successful replication <lb/>does not occur. A successful replication occurs if the re-<lb/>sults of the new study agree with those of the original <lb/>study or, slightly more precisely, if the results of the two <lb/>studies are commensurate. Exactly what is it, though, for <lb/>results to be commensurate? As several reports on repli-<lb/>cation point out 26 it is not required that the results are <lb/>identical-that would be too demanding in, say, many bio-<lb/>medical sciences. Again, it seems that &quot;agreeing&quot; is a prop-<lb/>erty of results that comes in degrees. More precisely, we <lb/>can distinguish at least the following senses, in order of in-<lb/>creasing strength: <lb/>The studies&apos; conclusions have the same direction <lb/>(e.g., both studies show a positive correlation <lb/>between X and Y); <lb/>The studies&apos; conclusions have the same direction <lb/>and the studies have a similar effect size (e.g., in <lb/>both studies, Y is three times as large with X as it is <lb/>with non-X; in some disciplines: the relative risk is <lb/>three (RR = 3)); <lb/>The studies&apos; conclusions have the same direction, <lb/>and the studies have a similar effect size and a <lb/>similar p value, confidence interval, or Bayes factor <lb/>(e.g., for both studies, RR = 3 (1.5-5.0)). 27 <lb/>The stronger the criterion for the sense in which stud-<lb/>ies results &quot;agree,&quot; the lower-ceteris paribus-the per-<lb/>centage of successful replications will be, at least when it <lb/>comes to quantitative empirical research. <lb/>Now, what does a typical replication study look like? <lb/>The aforementioned KNAW Advisory Report sketches <lb/>four characteristics: it &quot;(a) is carried out by a team of in-<lb/>dependent investigators; (b) generates new data; (c) <lb/></body>

			<body>follows the original protocol closely and justifies any de-<lb/>viations; and (d) attempts to explain the resulting degree <lb/>of reproducibility.&quot;. 28 Thus, even though, as I pointed <lb/>out above, independence does not require that the repli-<lb/>cation study be carried out by different researchers than <lb/>the original study, this is nonetheless often the case. <lb/>Below, we will explore to what extent we encounter the <lb/>combination of these characteristics in the humanities. <lb/>Before we move on to replicability and replication in the <lb/>humanities, I would like to make two preliminary points. <lb/>First, we should note that it follows from the definitions of <lb/>&quot;replicability&quot; and &quot;replication&quot; given in this section that <lb/>both replicability and replication are a matter of degree. 29 <lb/>Replication studies can be pretty much identical to the <lb/>original study, but very often there are slight or even <lb/>somewhat larger alterations in samples, instruments, con-<lb/>ditions, researcher skills, the body of researchers, and <lb/>sometimes even changes in the method. One can change <lb/>the method, for instance, in order to explore whether a <lb/>similar finding can be obtained by way of a rather different <lb/>method, or a finding that would similarly support one of <lb/>the relevant underlying hypotheses, at least if the auxiliary <lb/>assumptions are also met. Every replication study can be <lb/>located on a continuum that goes from being a replication <lb/>almost identical to the original study to hardly being a <lb/>replication at all. The closer the replication study topic is <lb/>to the topic of the original study, the more it counts as a <lb/>replication study, and, similarly, for method, samples, con-<lb/>ditions, and so on. How we ought to balance these various <lb/>factors in assessing how much of a replication a particular <lb/>study is, is a complicated matter that we need not settle <lb/>here; all we need to realize is that replication is something <lb/>that comes in degrees. As I briefly spelled out above, in <lb/>laying out Etienne LeBel&apos;s replication taxonomy, a study <lb/>can be more or less of a replication of an original study. 30 <lb/>Second, exactly what is it that should be replicable in a <lb/>good replication study? There are at least three candi-<lb/>dates here: the study as a whole, the inferences involved <lb/>in the study, and the results of the study. 31 I will focus <lb/>on the replicability of a study&apos;s results. After all, as sug-<lb/>gested in our discussion above, we want to leave room <lb/>for the possibility of a direct replication (which uses new <lb/>data, so that the study as a whole is not replicated), and <lb/>a conceptual replication (which uses new data and a new <lb/>research protocol, so that neither the study as a whole <lb/>nor its specific inferences are replicated). This means <lb/>that a study is replicable if a new study can be carried <lb/>out, producing results that might agree with those of the <lb/>original study in the sense specified above. <lb/>Potential obstacles to replication in the <lb/>humanities <lb/>Now, one might think that, in opposition to the quanti-<lb/>tative empirical sciences, such as the biomedical <lb/>sciences, the humanities are not really suited for the <lb/>phenomenon of replication. In this section, I discuss <lb/>three arguments in support of this claim. <lb/>1. The first objection to the idea that replication is <lb/>possible in the humanities is that, frequently, the study <lb/>object in the humanities is unique 32 : there was one <lb/>French Revolution in 1789-1799, there is one novel of <lb/>Virginia Woolf named To the Lighthouse (1928), pieces <lb/>of architecture, such as Magdalen College&apos;s library in <lb/>Oxford, are unique, and so on. Viruses, atoms, leg frac-<lb/>tures, Borneo&apos;s rhinos, economic measures, and many <lb/>other study objects in the empirical sciences, have mul-<lb/>tiple instances. In a replication study one can investigate <lb/>a different instance or token than the one studied in the <lb/>original study; an instance or token of the same type. <lb/>However, this objection fails for two reasons. On the <lb/>one hand, many study objects in the humanities do have <lb/>multiple instances. On the other hand, quite a few study <lb/>objects in the empirical sciences are unique. As to the <lb/>former: Virginia Woolf&apos;s To the Lighthouse is unique, <lb/>but it is also one of many instances of novels using a <lb/>stream-of-consciousness-narrative technique; the French <lb/>Revolution is unique, but it is an instance of a social <lb/>revolution, of which the American Revolution in 1775-<lb/>1783 and the Russian Revolution in 1917 are other ex-<lb/>amples. Magdalen College library can be compared to <lb/>other college libraries in Oxford, to other libraries across <lb/>the country, and to other buildings in the late fifteenth <lb/>century. And so on. Parts of linguistics study grammat-<lb/>ical structures that, by definition, have many instances, <lb/>as will be clear from any introduction to morphosyn-<lb/>tax. 33 As to the quantitative empirical sciences: the big <lb/>bang, the coming into existence of life on earth, <lb/>space-time itself, and many other phenomena studied in <lb/>the empirical sciences are unique phenomena: there is <lb/>only one instance of them. Thus, the idea that the em-<lb/>pirical sciences study phenomena that have multiple in-<lb/>stances, whereas the humanities study unique <lb/>phenomena is, as a general claim, untenable. <lb/>Second and more importantly, whether or not the ob-<lb/>ject of study is unique or not is immaterial to the issue <lb/>of the replicability of a study on that object. After all, <lb/>one may study an object several times and studying it <lb/>several times may even generate new data (a typical <lb/>property of many replication studies, as we noted in the <lb/>previous section). For example, even though the French <lb/>revolution was a unique historical event (or a unique <lb/>series of events), that event comprises so many data, laid <lb/>down in artifacts, literary accounts, paintings, and so on, <lb/>that it is possible to repeat a particular method-say, <lb/>studying a text-and even discover new things about <lb/>that unique event. 34 <lb/>2. A second argument against the idea that replication <lb/>is possible in the humanities is that many methodologies <lb/></body>

			<body>that are employed in the humanities do not lend them-<lb/>selves well to replication. By replicating an empirical <lb/>study, say, on whether or not patients with incident mi-<lb/>graine, in comparison with the general population, have <lb/>higher absolute risks of suffering from myocardial infarc-<lb/>tion, stroke, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, <lb/>and heart failure 35 one can, in principle, apply the same <lb/>method or a similar method to new patients (say, a <lb/>population from a different country). One can generate <lb/>new data, thus making it likely-if replications consist-<lb/>ently deliver sufficiently similar results-that the original <lb/>results are true. One might think that no such thing <lb/>takes place when one employs the methods of the <lb/>humanities. <lb/>In response to this objection, I think it is important to <lb/>note that there is a wide variety of methods used in the <lb/>humanities. Among them are: more or less formal logic <lb/>(in philosophy, theology, and law), literary analysis (in <lb/>literary studies, philosophy, and theology), historical ana-<lb/>lysis (in historical studies, philosophy, and theology) and <lb/>various narrative approaches 36 (in historical studies), <lb/>constructivism (in art theory, for instance), Socratic <lb/>questioning (in philosophy), methods involving empathy <lb/>(in literary studies and art studies), conceptual analysis <lb/>(in philosophy and theology), the hermeneutical method <lb/>(in any humanistic discipline that involves careful read-<lb/>ing of texts, such as law, history, and theology), inter-<lb/>views (e.g., in anthropology), and phenomenology (in <lb/>philosophy). This is important to note, because, as I <lb/>pointed out above, I only want to argue that replication <lb/>is possible in the humanities to the extent that they are <lb/>empirical. Replication may not be possible in disciplines <lb/>that primarily use a deductive method and that do not <lb/>collect and analyze data, such as logic, mathematics, cer-<lb/>tain parts of ethics, and metaphysics. This leaves plenty <lb/>of room for replication in disciplines that are empirical, <lb/>such as literary studies, linguistics, history, and the study <lb/>of the arts. <lb/>Take the hermeneutical method. Does reading a text <lb/>again make it, all else being equal, likely that one&apos;s inter-<lb/>pretation is correct? It seems to me the answer here has <lb/>to be positive. There are at least two reasons for that. <lb/>First, one may have made certain mistakes in one&apos;s ori-<lb/>ginal reading and interpretation: faulty reading, sloppy <lb/>analysis, forgetting relevant passages, and so on, on the <lb/>first occasion may play a role. If one&apos;s second interpret-<lb/>ation differs from the first, one will normally realize that <lb/>and revisit the relevant passage, comparing which of the <lb/>two interpretations is more plausible. This will generally <lb/>increase the likelihood that one comes to a correct inter-<lb/>pretation of, say, the relevant passage in Ovid. Second, if <lb/>one re-reads certain passages that will be with new back-<lb/>ground beliefs, given that humanistic scholars gradually <lb/>acquire more knowledge in the course of their lives. <lb/>That may lead to a new interpretation. Unless one thinks <lb/>that new beliefs are as likely to be false as true-which <lb/>seems implausible-carefully re-reading a passage with <lb/>relevant new background beliefs and coming to the same <lb/>result increases the likelihood of truth of one&apos;s interpret-<lb/>ation. These two points apply a forteriori when other ra-<lb/>ther than the same humanistic scholars apply the same <lb/>method of interpretation (the hermeneutical approach <lb/>or a historical-critical methodology) to the same text. <lb/>They will come to an interpretation and compare it with <lb/>the original one; if it differs, they are likely to revisit rele-<lb/>vant passages and, thereby, filter out forgetting, sloppi-<lb/>ness, and mistakes. 37 And, of course, they bring new <lb/>background knowledge to a text. That as well makes it <lb/>likely that when a study is consistently replicated, then, <lb/>all else being equal, the original study results are likely <lb/>to be true. <lb/>3. A third objection to the idea that replication is pos-<lb/>sible in the humanities, is that many of the study objects <lb/>in the humanities are normative in the sense that they <lb/>are objects of value and meaning, whereas this is not the <lb/>case in many of the natural and biomedical sciences. <lb/>RenÃ© van Woudenberg, for instance, has argued in a re-<lb/>cent paper that the objects of the humanities are such <lb/>meaningful and/or valuable things as words, sentences, <lb/>perlocutionary acts, buildings and paintings, music, and <lb/>all sorts of artifacts. Molecules, laws of nature, diseases, <lb/>and the like lack that specific sort of meaning and <lb/>value. 38 <lb/>In reply, let me say that I will grant the assumption <lb/>that the humanities are concerned with objects of value <lb/>and meaning, whereas the sciences are not (or at least <lb/>not with those aspects of those objects). I think this is <lb/>not entirely true: some humanistic disciplines, such as <lb/>metaphysics, are also concerned with objects that do not <lb/>have meaning or value, such as numbers or the nature <lb/>of space-time. It will still be true for most humanistic <lb/>disciplines, though. <lb/>However, this point is not relevant for the issue of rep-<lb/>lication. This can be seen by considering, on the one <lb/>hand, a scenario in which knowledge about value and <lb/>meaning is not possible and, on the other, a scenario in <lb/>which knowledge about value and meaning is possible. <lb/>First, imagine that it is impossible to uncover knowledge <lb/>about objects with value and meaning and specifically <lb/>about those aspects of those objects that concern value <lb/>and meaning. One may think, for instance, that there are <lb/>no such facts about value and meaning 39 or that they are <lb/>all socially constructed, so that it would not be right to <lb/>say that the humanities can uncover them. 40 This is, of <lb/>course, a controversial issue. Here, I will not delve into <lb/>this complex issue, which would merit a paper or more <lb/>of its own. Rather, I would like to point out that if it is <lb/>indeed impossible to uncover knowledge about value <lb/></body>

			<body>and meaning, then that is a problem for the humanities <lb/>in general, and not specifically for the issue of replication <lb/>in the humanities. For, if there is no value and meaning, <lb/>or if all value and meaning is socially constructed and <lb/>the humanities can, therefore, not truly uncover value <lb/>and meaning, one may rightly wonder to what extent <lb/>humanistic scholarship as an academic discipline is still <lb/>possible. <lb/>Now, imagine, on the other hand, that it is possible to <lb/>uncover knowledge about objects with value and mean-<lb/>ing and even about those aspects of those objects that <lb/>specifically concern value and meaning. Then, it seems <lb/>possible to uncover such knowledge and understanding <lb/>about the aspects that involve value and meaning mul-<lb/>tiple times for the same or similar objects. And that <lb/>would mean that in that case, it would very well be pos-<lb/>sible to carry out a replication study that involves con-<lb/>clusions about value and meaning. Of course, given the <lb/>fact that the objects have value and meaning, it might <lb/>sometimes be harder to reach agreement among <lb/>scholars. After all, background assumptions bear heavily <lb/>on issues concerning value and meaning. However, as <lb/>several examples below show, agreement about issues <lb/>concerning value and meaning is still quite often pos-<lb/>sible in the humanities. <lb/>I conclude that three main reasons for thinking that <lb/>replication is not possible in the humanities do not hold <lb/>water. <lb/>A positive case for the possibility of replication in <lb/>the humanities <lb/>So far, I have primarily deflected three objections to the <lb/>possibility of replication in the humanities. Is there actu-<lb/>ally also a more detailed, positive case to be made for <lb/>the possibility of replication in the humanities? Yes. In <lb/>this section, I shall provide such a case. <lb/>My positive, more substantive case is an inductive one: <lb/>there are many cases of replication studies in the human-<lb/>ities in the sense stipulated above: a study&apos;s being such <lb/>that a replication of it has successfully been carried out, <lb/>producing results that agree with the original study. More-<lb/>over, they often meet the four stereotypical properties <lb/>mentioned above: (a) they are carried out by a team of in-<lb/>dependent investigators; (b) they generate new data; (c) <lb/>they follow the original protocol (or, at least, method de-<lb/>scription) closely and justify any deviations; and (d) at-<lb/>tempt to explain the resulting degree of reproducibility. <lb/>Here is an example: re-interpreting Aurelius Augus-<lb/>tine&apos;s (354-430 AD) writings in order to see to what ex-<lb/>tent he continued to embrace or rejected Gnosticism. <lb/>Using the hermeneutical method 41 -with such principles <lb/>as that one should generally opt for interpretations of <lb/>passages that make the text internally coherent, that one <lb/>should, in interpreting a text, take its genre into account, <lb/>and so on-and relevant historical background know-<lb/>ledge, it has time and again been confirmed that August-<lb/>ine came to reject the basic tenets of Gnosticism-such <lb/>as the Manicheistic idea that good and evil are two <lb/>equally powerful forces in the world, but that it contin-<lb/>ued to exercise influence upon his thought-for in-<lb/>stance, when it comes to his assessment of the extent to <lb/>which we can enjoy things in themselves (frui) or merely <lb/>for the sake of some higher good, namely God (uti). 42 <lb/>Various independent researchers have argued this, in <lb/>doing so they came up with new data (new passages or <lb/>new historical background knowledge), they used the <lb/>same hermeneutical or historical-critical method, and <lb/>explained the consonance with the original results (and <lb/>thus the successful replication, even though they would <lb/>not have used that word) by sketching a larger picture of <lb/>Augustine&apos;s thought that made sense of his relation to <lb/>Gnosticism. <lb/>Here is another example of a study that employs the <lb/>hermeneutical method. The crucial difference with the <lb/>previous example is that this is still a hotly debated issue <lb/>and that it is not clear exactly what counts as a replication, <lb/>since it is not clear that advocates and opponents share <lb/>enough background beliefs in order to properly execute a <lb/>replication study; only the future will tell us whether that <lb/>is indeed the case. What I have in mind is the so-called <lb/>New Perspective on Paul in New Testament theology. <lb/>Since the 1960s, Protestant scholars started to interpret <lb/>the New Testament letters of Paul differently from how <lb/>they had been understood by Protestants so far. Historic-<lb/>ally, Lutherans and Reformed theologians had understood <lb/>Paul as arguing that the good works of faith do not factor <lb/>into their salvation-only faith itself would (in a slogan: <lb/>sola fide). The New Perspective, advocated by Ed Parish <lb/>Sanders and Tom Wright, 43 however, has it that Paul was <lb/>not so much addressing good works in general, but spe-<lb/>cific Jewish laws regarding circumcision, dietary laws, Sab-<lb/>bath laws, and other laws the observance of which set <lb/>Jews apart from other nations. The New Perspective has <lb/>been embraced by most Roman Catholic and Orthodox <lb/>theologians and a substantial number of Protestants theo-<lb/>logians, but is still very much under debate. Thus, we <lb/>should not conclude from the fact that some studies that <lb/>employ the hermeneutic method are replicable that all of <lb/>them are: some of them may involve too many controver-<lb/>sial background assumptions in order for a fairly straight-<lb/>forward replication to be possible. <lb/>However, it is easy to add examples of studies from <lb/>other humanistic fields that meet the criterion of replic-<lb/>ability. Here are two of them that use a different method <lb/>than the hermeneutical one: <lb/>The granodiorite stele that was named the Rosetta <lb/>Stone and that was found in 1799, has texts both in <lb/></body>

			<body>Ancient Egyptian, using hieroglyphic and Demotic <lb/>script, and an Ancient Greek text. The differences in <lb/>the content of these three texts are minor. The stone <lb/>has turned out be the key in deciphering Egyptian <lb/>hieroglyphs. A large number of scholars have <lb/>studied the stone in detail and the most important <lb/>results have been replicated multiple times. 44 <lb/>It was established in 2013 by way of various <lb/>methods-such as study of the materials, chemical <lb/>composition, painting style, and a study of his <lb/>letters-that the painting Sunset at Montmajour is a <lb/>true Van Gogh. It was painted on July 4, 1888. If <lb/>one has the right background knowledge and skills, <lb/>one can fairly easily study the same data or collect <lb/>further data in order to replicate this study. 45 <lb/>I take the examples given so far to be representative <lb/>and, therefore, to provide an inductive argument for the <lb/>possibility of replication in the humanities: it turns out <lb/>that in a variety of humanistic fields that employ differ-<lb/>ent methods replication is possible. <lb/>Now, the KNAW Advisory Report Replication Studies <lb/>mentions three things to pay attention to in carrying out <lb/>a replication study: (i) look at the raw data, the final out-<lb/>comes (results/conclusions) and/or everything in be-<lb/>tween, (ii) take a rigorous statistical approach or a more <lb/>qualitative approach in making the comparison between <lb/>the original study and the replication study, and (iii) de-<lb/>fine how much similarity is required for a successful rep-<lb/>lication. This is important, for it means that even the <lb/>specific way in which a replication study is supposed to <lb/>be carried out can be copied in a replication study in the <lb/>humanities. After all, it is possible (i) to compare the ori-<lb/>ginal data (say, certain texts, archeological findings, the <lb/>occurrence of certain verbs, and so on), the conclusions <lb/>of the original study and the replication study, and <lb/>everything in between, (ii) to take a qualitative approach <lb/>and sometimes even, if not a rigorous statistical ap-<lb/>proach, at least a more quantitative approach, e.g., by <lb/>counting the number of verbs in Shakespeare&apos;s plays that <lb/>end in &quot;th&quot; or &quot;st,&quot; and (iii) to define how much similar-<lb/>ity between the original results and the results in the <lb/>replication study is required for something&apos;s being a suc-<lb/>cessful replication, even though this will be harder or <lb/>impossible to quantify, in opposition to many studies in, <lb/>say, psychology and economics. <lb/>The desirability of replicability and replication in <lb/>the humanities <lb/>It is widely agreed that replicability is a desideratum and <lb/>replication an epistemically positive feature of a study in <lb/>the quantitative empirical sciences. Given that, as we <lb/>have seen in the preceding sections, replication is pos-<lb/>sible in the humanities, is it something we should <lb/>pursue? Should we desire that studies be replicable and <lb/>that a significant number of them be replicated, that is, <lb/>that they are indeed replicated with a positive, confirm-<lb/>ing outcome? <lb/>The answer has to be: Yes. After all, if, as I argued, <lb/>replication is possible in the humanities and consistent <lb/>replication makes it likely that the results of the original <lb/>study are true, then carrying out such replication studies <lb/>contributes to such core epistemic aims of the academic <lb/>enterprise as knowledge, insight, and understanding-<lb/>which all require truth. Of course, one will have to find <lb/>the right balance between carrying out new research-<lb/>with, possibly or likely, stumbling upon new truths, <lb/>never found before-and replicating a study and thereby <lb/>making it likely that the original study results are true. <lb/>However, there is nothing special about the humanities <lb/>when it comes to the fact that we need to find the right <lb/>balance between various intellectual goals: we need to <lb/>find the right balance in any discipline-medicine, <lb/>psychology, and economics included. This is not to deny <lb/>that there may be important differences between various <lb/>fields. Research indicates that as much as 70% of studies <lb/>in social psychology turn out not to be replicated upon <lb/>attempting to replicated them. 46 This gives us both epi-<lb/>stemic reason-it decreases the likelihood of truth of the <lb/>original study-and pragmatic reason-it defeats public <lb/>trust in science as a source of knowledge-to carry out <lb/>more replication studies. Thus, how much replication is <lb/>needed depends on the epistemic state a particular dis-<lb/>cipline is in. <lb/>Certainly, it is not at all common to speak of a &quot;repli-<lb/>cation crisis&quot; in the case of the humanities, in contrast <lb/>to some of the quantitative empirical sciences. As vari-<lb/>ous philosophers, such as Martha Nussbaum, 47 have ar-<lb/>gued, though, there is at least a crisis in the humanities <lb/>in the sense that they are relatively widely thought of as <lb/>having a low epistemic status. They are thought to be <lb/>not nearly as reliable as the sciences and not to provide <lb/>any robust knowledge. To give just one example, accord-<lb/>ing to American philosopher of science Alex Rosenberg: <lb/>When it comes to real understanding, the humanities <lb/>are nothing we have to take seriously, except as <lb/>symptoms. But they are everything we need to take <lb/>seriously when it comes to entertainment, enjoyment, <lb/>and psychological satisfaction. Just don&apos;t treat them as <lb/>knowledge or wisdom. 48 <lb/>Another well-known example is the recent so-called <lb/>grievance studies affair (or hoax). This was an attempt in <lb/>2017-2018 by three scholars-James Lindsay, Peter <lb/>Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose-to test the editorial <lb/>and peer review process of various fields in the human-<lb/>ities. They did so by trying to get bogus papers published <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Peels Research Integrity and Peer Review <lb/>(2019) 4:2 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 8 of 12 <lb/></page>

			<body>in influential academic journals in fields such as femin-<lb/>ism studies, gender studies, race studies, and sexuality <lb/>studies. They managed to publish a significant number <lb/>of papers (which were all retracted after the hoax was <lb/>revealed), and got an even larger number accepted <lb/>(without yet being published). However, it is rather con-<lb/>troversial exactly what this hoax shows about the epi-<lb/>stemic status of these fields in the humanities. 49 Some <lb/>have argued that the results would have been similar in <lb/>pretty much any other empirical discipline, 50 and still <lb/>others that we cannot conclude anything from this hoax, <lb/>since there was no control group. 51 <lb/>In any case, there may well be a crisis in how the hu-<lb/>manities are perceived. Yet, there does not seem to be a <lb/>replication crisis-at least, it is usually not framed as <lb/>such. There may, therefore, be somewhat less of a social <lb/>and epistemic urge to carry out replication studies in the <lb/>humanities. However, given the epistemic and pragmatic <lb/>reasons to do so, carrying out at least some replication <lb/>studies would be good for the humanities and for how <lb/>they are publicly perceived. <lb/>We should also realize that one of the reasons that <lb/>people started to talk about a replication crisis in certain <lb/>empirical sciences in the first place was that, apart from <lb/>problems with replicability (some studies did not even <lb/>meet that desideratum), for some studies an attempt at <lb/>replication took place but was unsuccessful, so they met <lb/>replicability as a desideratum, but not the positive prop-<lb/>erty of replication. That showed the need for more repli-<lb/>cation studies. Thus, one way to discover the need for <lb/>replication studies is, paradoxically, to carry out such <lb/>replication studies. This means that, in order to establish <lb/>the extent to which replication studies are needed in <lb/>various fields in the humanities, we should simply carry <lb/>them out. <lb/>Before we move on, I would like to discuss an objec-<lb/>tion against the desirability of replication in the human-<lb/>ities. The objection is that even though replication may <lb/>well be possible in the humanities, it is not particularly <lb/>desirable-not something to aim at or invest research <lb/>money on-because there is simply too much disagree-<lb/>ment in the humanities for there to be a successful repli-<lb/>cation sufficiently often. Thus, even though many <lb/>humanistic studies would be replicable, carrying out a <lb/>replication study would in the majority of cases lead to <lb/>different results. In philosophy, for instance, there is a <lb/>rather radical divide between scholars in the analytic <lb/>tradition and scholars in the continental tradition. One <lb/>might think it likely that a replication of any study by <lb/>members of the one group would lead to substantially <lb/>different results if carried out by members of the other <lb/>group. <lb/>We should not forget, though, that we find radically <lb/>different sorts of schools within, say, economics or <lb/>physics. In economics, for instance, we find the econom-<lb/>ics of the Saltwater school, the economics of the Fresh-<lb/>water school, and, more rarely, institutional economics, <lb/>Austrian economics, feminist economics, Marxian eco-<lb/>nomics, and ecological economics. In quantum mechan-<lb/>ics, we find a wide variety of different interpretations <lb/>with different ideas about randomness and determinacy, <lb/>the nature of measurement, and which elements in <lb/>quantum mechanics can be considered real: the Stand-<lb/>ard or Copenhagen interpretation, the consistent histor-<lb/>ies interpretation, the many worlds interpretation, the <lb/>transactional interpretation, and so on. <lb/>The problem that this objection draws our attention <lb/>to, then, is a general one: if a study from one school of <lb/>thought is replicated by members of a different school of <lb/>thought, it is much more likely that relevant background <lb/>assumptions will be different and various auxiliary hy-<lb/>potheses will play an important role. This may make it <lb/>easier for the researchers of the original study to reject <lb/>the results of the new study if they differ from those of <lb/>the original one: they may point to different background <lb/>assumptions and different auxiliary hypotheses. That <lb/>does not necessarily undermine the value of those repli-<lb/>cation studies, though revision in background assump-<lb/>tions or change in auxiliary hypotheses may be widely <lb/>considered to be an improvement in comparison with <lb/>the original study or a legitimate change for other rea-<lb/>sons. Also, even if the study&apos;s background assumptions <lb/>are different and various auxiliary hypotheses differ, the <lb/>study may still be successfully replicated. <lb/>The most important point to note here, though, is <lb/>that, to the extent that this is a problem (and we have <lb/>seen that it is not necessarily a problem at all), it is a <lb/>general problem and not one that is unique to the <lb/>humanities. <lb/>This is not to deny that there may be situations in <lb/>which there is too much divergence on background as-<lb/>sumptions, method, relevant auxiliary hypotheses, and <lb/>so on, to carry out a replication study. This will be the <lb/>case for some humanistic studies and research groups, as <lb/>it will be the case for some scientific studies and research <lb/>groups. What this means is that in some humanistic dis-<lb/>ciplines, replicability is still a desideratum and replicabil-<lb/>ity surely is still a positive property, but the absence of <lb/>replicability because of severe limits on the possibility of <lb/>replication is not necessarily a reason to discard that <lb/>study. In other words, in balancing the theoretical vir-<lb/>tues of various hypotheses and studies in the humanities, <lb/>replicability will sometimes not be weighed as heavily as, <lb/>say, consistency with background knowledge, simplicity, <lb/>internal coherence, and other intellectual virtues. That <lb/>is, of course, as such not a problem at all, as the weight <lb/>of various intellectual virtues differs from discipline to <lb/>discipline anyway; predictive power, for instance, is <lb/></body>

			<body>crucial in much of physics, but carries much less weight <lb/>in economics and evolutionary biology. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>I conclude that replication is possible in the humanities. <lb/>By that, I mean that empirical studies in the humanities <lb/>are often such that an independent repetition of it, using <lb/>similar or different methods and conducted under simi-<lb/>lar circumstances, can be carried out. I also conclude <lb/>that replicability is desirable in the humanities: by that, I <lb/>mean that many empirical studies in the humanities <lb/>should indeed be such that an independent repetition of <lb/>it, using similar or different methods and conducted <lb/>under similar circumstances, can be carried out. And I <lb/>conclude that carrying out replication studies in the hu-<lb/>manities is desirable: we should actually frequently carry <lb/>out such independent repetitions of published studies. <lb/>Exactly how desirable replication in the humanities is re-<lb/>mains to be seen; paradoxically, carrying out replication <lb/>studies in the humanities may tell us more about exactly <lb/>how desirable doing so is. <lb/></body>

[11], 2. <lb/>Bouter [12] further analyzes the causes for various kinds <lb/>of questionable research practices. For the issue of lack <lb/>of effective peer review, see, for instance, [13]. In this <lb/>paper, Smith argues that there is actually no systematic-<lb/>ally acquired evidence for thinking that peer review is a <lb/>good quality assurance mechanism and that we do have <lb/>good evidence for thinking that peer review has a large <lb/>number of downsides. <lb/>7 For these points, see also KNAW [10], 4, 20-22. <lb/>8 Note the KNAW Advisory Report&apos;s subtitle: Improv-<lb/>ing Reproducibility in the Empirical Sciences. <lb/>9 KNAW [10], 16. <lb/>10 See [14, 15], and a recent co-authored blog: [16]. <lb/>The paper at hand provides a much more in-depth ex-<lb/>ploration of the ideas about replication in the humanities <lb/>advocated in these three pieces. <lb/>11 The humanities are to be distinguished from the sci-<lb/>ences, where I take the sciences to include the applied <lb/>sciences, such as medicine, engineering, computer sci-<lb/>ence, and applied physics, the formal sciences, such as <lb/>decision theory, statistics, systems theory, theoretical <lb/>computer science, and mathematics, the natural sci-<lb/>ences, such as physics, chemistry, earth science, ecology, <lb/>oceanography, geology, meteorology, astronomy, life sci-<lb/>ence, biology, zoology, and botany, and the social sci-<lb/>ences, such as criminology, economy, and psychology. <lb/>12 I would be happy, though, to embrace the definitions <lb/>given of these terms in the KNAW Advisory Report, viz. <lb/>for &quot;robustness&quot;: the extent to which the conclusions de-<lb/>pend on minor changes in the procedures and assump-<lb/>tions, for &quot;reliability of measurements&quot;: the <lb/>measurement error due to variation, and for &quot;verifiability <lb/>of results&quot;: the extent to which the study documentation <lb/>provides enough information on how results have been <lb/>attained to assess compliance with relevant standards <lb/>(cf. [10], 19). As will become clear from what follows in <lb/>this section, the phenomena of robustness, reliability, <lb/>and verifiability, thus understood, are in interesting ways <lb/>related to, but nevertheless clearly conceptually distinct <lb/>from replication, replicability, reproduction, and <lb/>reproducibility. <lb/>13 Some people use the word &quot;reproduction&quot; somewhat <lb/>more narrowly, namely merely for a study that <lb/>re-analyzes the same data of the original study and scru-<lb/>tinizes whether they lead to the same results. I will use a <lb/>broader definition here. <lb/>14 For a similar definition, see KNAW [10], 18; NSF <lb/>[17], 4-5. IAP [9], unfortunately, provides no definition. <lb/>15 A fourth option, not mentioned in the report, is to <lb/>carry out a replication with the same data and a new or <lb/>revised research protocol. <lb/>16 For the purposes of the paper, I take a &quot;research <lb/>protocol&quot; to be primarily a description of the study de-<lb/>sign: a description of which data are taken to be relevant <lb/>and which method is used. <lb/>17 Italics are mine. See https://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/ <lb/>our-funding-instruments/sgw/replication-studies/replica-<lb/>tion-studies.html, last visited August 30, 2018. For the <lb/>different kinds of replication, see also [18]. <lb/>18 The KNAW [10] report, for instance, does not. <lb/>19 See LeBel et al. [19], 9; see also Earp and Trafimow <lb/>[20]. <lb/>20 Thus, for instance, KNAW [10], 18: &quot;reproducibility <lb/>concerns the extent to which the results of a replication <lb/>study agree with those of the earlier study.&quot; <lb/>21 For example, LeBel et al. [19]. <lb/>22 See, for instance, Popper [21]. <lb/>23 See [22]. As to the role of auxiliary assumptions, <lb/>such as ones about the role of language, he also gives a <lb/>particular example that illustrates this claim-one about <lb/>walking speed in response to being primed with the eld-<lb/>erly stereotype (the original study being [23]). For fur-<lb/>ther illustrations of the fact that direct falsification of a <lb/>theory is virtually impossible, see [20, 24]. <lb/>24 See Earp and Trafimov [20] <lb/></div>

We find the same <lb/>idea among certain neo-Kantians; see, for instance, [29]. <lb/>33 See, for instance, Payne [30]. <lb/>34 Moreover, one may wonder whether there are such <lb/>things as unique historical events studied by historians. <lb/>One might think, for instance, that the French revolu-<lb/>tion is not a unique historical event, but just a series of <lb/>(virtually) infinitely many smaller events, and that his-<lb/>tory always studies a combination of those events rather <lb/>than a single, unique event. <lb/>35 This was concluded by a recent study; see [31]. <lb/>36 For example, Lorenz [32]. <lb/>37 In a way, then, replication-including replication in <lb/>the humanities-is like what mathematicians do in <lb/>checking a proof and lay people in checking a particular <lb/>calculation (say, splitting the bill in a restaurant); if a <lb/>large number of competent people come to the same re-<lb/>sult, then, all else being equal, the result is likely to be <lb/>true. <lb/>38 See [33], 112-122. This is not to deny that they may <lb/>have meaning or significance in some sense; the <lb/>double-helix structure of DNA may be of special signifi-<lb/>cance to, say, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind <lb/>Franklin. <lb/>39 For a defense of this position, see [34]. <lb/>40 For an exploration and discussion, see, for instance, <lb/>[35]. <lb/>41 For a more detailed exposition and discussion of the <lb/>hermeneutical method, see [36, 37]. <lb/>42 For this interpretation, see various essays in Van <lb/>[38]; and [39]. <lb/>43 See Sander [40] and Wright [41]. <lb/>44 For an overview of much research on the Rosetta <lb/>stone, see [42]. <lb/>45 See Van Tilborgh, Meedendorp, Van Maanen [43]. <lb/>46 See, for instance, Klein [44]. <lb/>47 See Nussbaum [45], chapter 1. <lb/>48 Rosenberg [34], 307. <lb/>49 See Lindsay et al. [46]. For a more positive assess-<lb/>ment, see Mounk 2018 [47]. <lb/>50 See Engber 2018 [48]. <lb/>51 See [49]. For a defense of the hoax on these two <lb/>points, see Essig, Moorti 2018 [50]. <lb/></div>
