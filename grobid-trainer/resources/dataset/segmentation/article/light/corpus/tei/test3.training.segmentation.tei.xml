			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a complication of <lb/>advanced cancer that carries a poor prognosis and most <lb/>commonly affects patients with breast cancer. 1,2 Indeed, in a <lb/>retrospective case series of 103 consecutive unselected patients <lb/>with LC from breast cancer, median overall survival was only <lb/>3.8 months, less than even the already poor estimates reported <lb/>among selected patients enrolled in prospective randomized <lb/>trials. 3 More effective treatments for systemic metastatic <lb/>disease have resulted in patients living longer, at an increased <lb/>risk of LC. 4-8 Yet, because of a dramatic paucity of data regarding <lb/>the choice of therapeutic interventions, practice patterns vary <lb/>widely. 9 Pre-clinical or early phase I studies in the glioblastoma <lb/>have demonstrated that poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) <lb/>inhibitors penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting <lb/>a possible role of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of the brain or <lb/>leptomeningeal metastasis. 10 Breast cancer patients with heredi-<lb/>tary BRCA1/2 mutations develop CNS metastasis earlier than non-<lb/>carrier patients, even when matched for age, stage, estrogen <lb/>receptor (ER) expression, and human epidermal growth factor <lb/>receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and are in need of effective <lb/>therapies. 11 We report a case of a patient with a hereditary BRCA2 <lb/>mutation and LC, who demonstrated an excellent clinical and <lb/>radiographic response to olaparib. <lb/>CASE REPORT <lb/>A woman with a history of left-sided ductal carcinoma in situ <lb/>diagnosed at age 48 years and who was treated with lumpectomy, <lb/>radiation, and 5 years of tamoxifen presented with anatomic <lb/>distortion in the left nipple 12 years later, at age 62 years. A <lb/>bilateral diagnostic mammogram was initially unremarkable, but a <lb/>mammogram 6 months later showed irregular nodules and <lb/>architectural distortion in the retro-areolar region in the mid <lb/>lower quadrant of the left breast. Further imaging demonstrated a <lb/>1.5 × 0.8 × 1.1 cm lesion and an ultrasound-guided core biopsy <lb/>showed grade III invasive lobular carcinoma with significant <lb/>perineural invasion. A left-sided skin sparing mastectomy with <lb/>axillary lymph node dissection confirmed extensive grade II/III <lb/>invasive lobular carcinoma measuring 10.4 cm and invading <lb/>skeletal muscle. A 0.3 cm area of fibroadipose tissue in the deep <lb/>surgical margin was positive for invasive carcinoma and metastatic <lb/>carcinoma was present in 21 of 24 lymph nodes. Immunohisto-<lb/>chemistry studies demonstrated 80% ER and 90% progesterone <lb/>receptor positivity; HER2/NEU and E-cadherin were negative. The <lb/>final pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition) <lb/>staging was T3N3a. After the initial negative systemic staging, the <lb/>patient received standard adjuvant chemotherapy with dose-<lb/>dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel <lb/>starting 1 month after surgery, followed by postmastectomy and <lb/>axillary radiation. She started on adjuvant endocrine therapy with <lb/>anastrozole. Commercial genetic testing via Myriad Genetics, Inc., <lb/>demonstrated a hereditary pathogenic BRCA2 mutation (7558C &gt; T). <lb/>At age 62 years, she underwent risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-<lb/>oophorectomy with pathology showing no evidence of ovarian <lb/>carcinoma. <lb/>Eleven months after completing adjuvant treatment, the patient <lb/>developed difficulty focusing her eyes, disequilibrium, and mild <lb/>headache. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance <lb/>Status was 1. Ocular motor examination by a neuro-<lb/>ophthalmologist identified a small hypertropia of the right eye <lb/>that increased in the left gaze, downward gaze, and with the right <lb/>head tilt, consistent with a fourth nerve palsy. The remaining <lb/>physical exam was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging <lb/>(MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast showed <lb/>enhancement of the bilateral fifth, seventh, and eight cranial <lb/>nerves (Fig. 1a-d), 12 and spinal MRI with and without contrast <lb/>demonstrated patchy circumferential enhancement of the lower <lb/>thoracic and lumbar spine, and enhancement of the cauda equina <lb/>nerve roots, all consistent with LC. Lumbar puncture demon-<lb/>strated an opening pressure of 24 cm cerebrospinal fluid, white <lb/>blood cell count 2 (normal &lt; 5), and protein 106 mg/dL (normal <lb/>19-40 mg/dL). Spinal fluid cytology was positive for malignant <lb/>cells, confirming LC. Re-staging computed tomography (CT) scan <lb/></body>

			<body>of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of other <lb/>metastatic involvement. <lb/>Anastrozole was discontinued on confirmation of metastatic <lb/>disease. The patient provided written informed consent to <lb/>participate in a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review <lb/>Board-approved registry study including publication of this case <lb/>report. Standard treatment approaches to LC were reviewed, <lb/>including radiation therapy (RT) and intrathecal chemotherapy <lb/>(IT-CT). Given her overall excellent performance status and low <lb/>symptom burden, as well as the known limited efficacy and <lb/>significant toxicity of standard approaches, we considered <lb/>additional options. The patient started on olaparib 300 mg twice <lb/>daily with good tolerance. After 4 weeks of olaparib therapy, her <lb/>headaches, disequilibrium, and visual symptoms resolved. Repeat <lb/>lumbar puncture was not performed given the strong correlation <lb/>between clinical symptoms, physical exam, and MRI findings. No <lb/>adverse effects related to olaparib were observed. The first re-<lb/>staging brain MRI performed 4 months after starting olaparib <lb/>demonstrated improved, mild enhancement of the cisternal <lb/>segments of the cranial nerves VII and VIII, and no enhancement <lb/>of the fifth cranial nerves. One year from LC diagnosis and <lb/>initiation of olaparib, brain MRI showed complete resolution of <lb/>previous cranial nerve enhancement (Fig. 2a, b). Spinal MRI at that <lb/>time showed resolution of circumferential thoracic and lumbar <lb/>spine enhancement, with only vague enhancement and no <lb/>thickening of the cauda equina nerve roots (Fig. 2c). Body <lb/>imaging continues to show no evidence of systemic metastatic <lb/>disease. Nineteen months after initiation of olaparib for treatment <lb/>of LC, she continues on the drug and remains asymptomatic with <lb/>imaging showing ongoing response to therapy. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>LC is increasingly common, comprising about 11-20% of CNS <lb/>metastasis in breast cancer. 13 Prospective studies have found a <lb/>median overall survival of 9-30.3 weeks in patients diagnosed <lb/>with meningeal metastasis. 3,14 Hormonal status, HER2 amplifica-<lb/>tion followed by trastuzumab treatment, and good initial <lb/>performance status has been associated with a better prognosis <lb/>in patients with breast cancer LC. In addition, some studies have <lb/>demonstrated that cytologic and clinical response are both <lb/>associated with improvement in survival. 15 Data suggest that <lb/>patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and metastatic breast cancer <lb/>develop CNS involvement, and that BRCA2 mutation carriers <lb/>develop CNS metastases at a higher frequency than non-carriers <lb/>when controlling for subtype. 16 <lb/>Currently, there is no accepted standard treatment for patients <lb/>with breast cancer who present with LC, and treatment options <lb/>include RT, IT-CT, and systemic chemotherapy. RT may be more <lb/>effective in patients with localized symptoms or bulky disease, and <lb/>the application of focal radiation is preferred over craniospinal <lb/>radiotherapy due to lower toxicity. 17 Although IT-CT with <lb/>methotrexate, cytarabine, or thiotepa has been considered the <lb/>mainstay of the treatment for leptomeningeal disease, poor data <lb/>are available to support its routine use. Four small prospective <lb/>trials evaluated IT-CT and difference in the efficacy of these <lb/>agents, and there was a discouraging median survival of <lb/>9-30 weeks and a significant rate of adverse events. 14,18-20 IT <lb/>trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients has demonstrated cytologic <lb/>and radiographic responses in some case series, but its safety and <lb/>efficacy remain under investigation. 21 <lb/>Recently, a shift toward the use of isolated systemic <lb/>chemotherapy has gained strength. A small randomized trial <lb/>comparing systemic or radiation treatment plus IT-CT with non-IT-<lb/>CT treatment demonstrated superior neurological improvement in <lb/>the non-IT-CT patient group and a numerical, but not statistically <lb/>significant survival difference in the non-IT-CT group (18.3 weeks <lb/>vs. 30.3 weeks for non-IT patients; 95% confidence interval (CI) <lb/>−5.5 to +34.3; p = 0.32). 18 In addition, patients who received IT-CT <lb/>presented with more neurological complications (47% vs. 6%; <lb/>b <lb/>d <lb/>c <lb/>e <lb/>a <lb/>Fig. 1 MRI of the brain and spine with and without contrast at diagnosis. a, b T1-weighted axial images show enhancement of the bilateral <lb/>fifth cranial nerves after the administration of gadolinium contrast. c, d There is enhancement of the bilateral seventh-eighth cranial nerve <lb/>complexes. e Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast spine images demonstrate patchy circumferential enhancement along the thoracic and <lb/>lumbar spinal cord (arrow heads) and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots (arrows), related to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. <lb/></body>

			<body>p = 0.0072). 18 Drugs with penetration across a disrupted <lb/>blood-brain barrier (BBB), such as doxorubicin, capecitabine, and <lb/>high-doses methotrexate may provide some clinical benefit. <lb/>Lately, targeted therapies with small molecules, mostly in patients <lb/>with driver gene mutation lung cancer, have been evaluated in <lb/>patients with LC with mixed results. 22,23 In this context, PARP <lb/>inhibitors emerge as a possible alternative for the treatment of <lb/>leptomeningeal disease in BRCA carrier patients. <lb/>Olaparib was the first PARP inhibitor approved by the US Food <lb/>and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic breast <lb/>cancer patients with deleterious germline alterations in BRCA1 or <lb/>BRCA2. Pre-clinical data in animal models initially suggested a lack <lb/>of CNS penetration of olaparib 24 and early clinical trials excluded <lb/>women with untreated CNS metastases. 24-26 Subsequently, further <lb/>work investigating other PARP inhibitors showed successful brain <lb/>penetration in rodent models with disrupted BBBs due to CNS <lb/>malignancy. 27,28 An additional, recently presented study showed <lb/>the limited brain penetration of another PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, <lb/>in murine models with intact BBB. The authors showed that, <lb/>despite this finding, antitumor effect was seen in a BRCA1-mutant <lb/>intracranial murine model. 29 These findings collectively suggest a <lb/>potential role for PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated CNS malig-<lb/>nancies, despite apparently limited drug penetration in intact BBB. <lb/>A case study of a patient with BRCA2-mutated metastatic ovarian <lb/>cancer involving the CNS provides clinical support for this <lb/>approach. 30 <lb/>In the randomized phase III Olaparib Monotherapy Versus <lb/>Physicians Choice Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Metastatic <lb/>Breast Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA1/2 Mutations (Olym-<lb/>piAD) study evaluating olaparib vs. treatment of physician&apos;s choice <lb/>in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, <lb/>patients with treated, stable CNS metastases were eligible. A <lb/>global progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was seen (hazard <lb/>ratio (HR) 0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.80, p &lt; 0.001), and although this <lb/>benefit was more pronounced in patients with measurable <lb/>disease, no brain metastasis-specific analysis was performed. 31 A <lb/>phase I trial evaluating the use of olaparib in combination with <lb/>temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma multiforme was <lb/>presented recently at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Society for <lb/>Neuro-Oncology in 2017. The authors detected olaparib in 73 of <lb/>74 tumor core specimens from 27 patients and in 27 of 28 tumor <lb/>margin specimens from 10 patients, indicating safety and drug <lb/>penetration in patients with non-intact BBB. 10 <lb/>A second PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, has been recently <lb/>approved for the treatment of germline BRCA1/2-associated <lb/>metastatic breast cancer after the phase III EMBRACA trial (A <lb/>Study Evaluating Talazoparib, a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/ <lb/>or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with BRCA Mutation) <lb/>compared talazoparib alone with standard chemotherapy in the <lb/>first-fourth line treatment setting. 32 A PFS benefit was observed <lb/>(HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71, p &lt; 0.001) in the talazoparib arm when <lb/>compared with chemotherapy of provider choice. Notably, 15% of <lb/>patients in the PARP inhibitor arm had stable/treated CNS disease <lb/>at baseline. In a subgroup analysis, these patients also demon-<lb/>strated a PFS benefit compared with chemotherapy, with an HR to <lb/>the left of patients without brain metastasis (HR 0.32, 95% CI <lb/>0.15-0.68 and HR 0.58, CI 95% 0.43-0.78, respectively), suggesting <lb/>the possibility of a CNS effect of the drug. 32 Unfortunately, similar <lb/>to the OlympiAD trial, the EMBRACA trial did not allow patients <lb/>with active parenchymal brain metastases or any history of <lb/>leptomeningeal CNS metastases, and thus is unable to shed <lb/>a <lb/>b <lb/>c <lb/>Fig. 2 MRI brain and spine, 12 months following treatment with olaparib. a, b Axial T1-weighted post-contrast images show resolved <lb/>enhancement of the fifth cranial nerves (a, arrowhead) and seventh-eighth cranial nerves complexes (b, arrows). Linear enhancement <lb/>adjacent to the right seventh-eighth cranial nerve complex was consistent with a vascular loop. c Sagittal T1-weight MRI of the spine, post <lb/>contrast, shows minimal enhancement anterior to the thoracic spinal cord (arrowhead) and subtle enhancement within the cauda equina <lb/>nerve roots (arrow). <lb/></body>

			<body>further light on whether PARP inhibitors are active in the CNS, <lb/>with respect to CNS response rates or duration of CNS response. <lb/>Our patient with leptomeningeal metastasis in the setting of <lb/>BRCA2-mutated breast cancer has maintained a complete clinical <lb/>and a robust radiographic response to olaparib after 19 months of <lb/>therapy. Although she has additional favorable prognostic factors <lb/>such as an ER-positive receptor status, excellent performance <lb/>status, and previously untreated metastatic disease, her response <lb/>suggests efficacy of olaparib and her survival far exceeds reported <lb/>medians for LC in breast cancer. In conclusion, the present case <lb/>supports a potential role for PARP inhibitors in the treatment of LC <lb/>and other CNS metastasis of breast cancer in patients with <lb/>hereditary BRCA mutations. Given the relative paucity of patients <lb/>with LC from BRCA-associated, metastatic breast cancer, a <lb/>randomized trial to test PARP inhibitors vs. IT or other standard <lb/>approaches will not be feasible. We believe that the exclusion of <lb/>patients with active CNS disease from the early phase and <lb/>registration trials of PARP inhibitors represents a missed oppor-<lb/>tunity, and we would encourage investigators to consider <lb/>liberalizing the CNS inclusion criteria for trials testing PARP <lb/>inhibitors in the future. Alternatively, registry or other approaches <lb/>to harness data in the post-marketing setting may allow for a <lb/>greater understanding of the CNS efficacy of PARP inhibitors and <lb/>other novel agents. <lb/></body>
