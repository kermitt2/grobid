		<body>■ INTRODUCTION <lb/>Benzo[b]furans are frequently encountered structural cores in <lb/>natural compounds 1-4 and bioactive molecules. 5-11 The <lb/>significance of the benzofuran framework is evidenced from <lb/>its ubiquity in plant products and prevalence as the central <lb/>structures of several biomolecules, especially antimicro-<lb/>bials, 12-14 analgesics, 15,16 and anti-inflammatory agents. 7,17 <lb/>This biologically useful heterocyclic core structure is also part <lb/>of several drug molecules (Figure 1). 6,18,19 Given its practical <lb/>significance, there is strong justification for the development of <lb/>new and efficient synthetic routes to access benzofurans, <lb/>especially in an environmentally benign and sustainable <lb/>manner. Currently, there are several synthetic routes reported <lb/>in the synthetic organic chemistry literature for these <lb/>compounds that report excellent reaction yields and <lb/>selectivity. 13,14,20,21 However, there are very few reports on <lb/>improving efficiency of these reactions in a sustainable manner <lb/>consistent with the principles of green chemistry. We report a <lb/>convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of <lb/>substituted benzofurans through the iodocyclization reaction <lb/>(Scheme 1) in an aqueous environment using economic, safe, <lb/>and environmentally benign reagents (CuSO 4 and NaI) under <lb/>mild/moderate conditions. In the aforementioned reaction <lb/>condition, iodocyclization conversions are at least thrice higher <lb/>than the reaction in a polar protic solvent such as ethanol. <lb/>There have been no reports on the in situ generation of I 2 for <lb/>iodocyclization of 2-alkynylanisoles and its efficiency in organic <lb/>and aqueous media. This work features the unusual <lb/></body>

		<body>phenomenon of an organic reaction in an aqueous slurry and <lb/>the amenability of this reaction toward sustainable synthesis. <lb/>Water-soluble hosts, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), calixar-<lb/>enes, and micelles, have been often employed in influencing <lb/>reaction rates of reactions in aqueous media; both increase <lb/>(catalysis) and decrease (retardant) in reaction rates have been <lb/>used to understand the characteristics of the reaction in the <lb/>aqueous environment. Herein, we report our findings on the <lb/>influence of cyclodextrin family on the iodocyclization reaction <lb/>rates in an aqueous environment through encapsulation. <lb/>Empirical findings of reaction rates coupled with spectral <lb/>titration and computational investigations provide information <lb/>about the structural aspects of the host-guest inclusion <lb/>complex. In addition, the influence of hosts on the reaction <lb/>rates has been studied in this work, which offers a unique <lb/>insight into a previously unexplored mechanistic feature of the <lb/>iodocyclization reaction. <lb/>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION <lb/>The starting substrate, 1-methoxy-2-(phenylethynyl)benzene <lb/>(1a), was prepared based on the previously reported <lb/>procedure. 22 Stock solutions of the alkyne 1a in dichloro-<lb/>methane and aqueous solutions of copper sulfate and sodium <lb/>iodide (separately) were prepared in standard flasks. The <lb/>volume corresponding to the required mass of the substrate <lb/>was pipetted into a glass vial and the solvent was evaporated <lb/>off. To the resulting neat substrate in the vial, the required <lb/>volume of aqueous solution of reagents was dispensed, <lb/>followed by water to bring the solution to a specific dilution. <lb/>Typical concentrations of the experiment are 0.3 mmol of the <lb/>substrate in 25 mL of the aqueous medium. The durations and <lb/>temperature of the reaction are specified in Table 1. Following <lb/>the reaction, the slurry was diluted with water and subject to <lb/>biphasic extraction by stirring the solution with ethyl acetate <lb/>for 5 h. The organic layer was isolated, the solvent removed in <lb/>vacuo, and the residue from the reaction analyzed <lb/>spectroscopically. The proportions of the product and reactant <lb/>as well as conversions were calculated based on the integration <lb/>of peak areas in the 1 H NMR spectra (Supporting <lb/>Information) recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE <lb/>spectrometer. <lb/>For the reaction in organic solvent, 0.3 mmol of alkyne was <lb/>dissolved in 10 mL of an appropriate solvent followed by the <lb/>addition of specific amounts of CuSO 4 •5H 2 O and NaI. <lb/>Additional solvent was added such that the final volume was <lb/>25 mL. The reaction solutions were stirred at the temperatures <lb/>and for the durations in Table 2. Following the reactions, ethyl <lb/>alcohol was removed in vacuo. Residue water and ethyl acetate <lb/>were added to separate the organic and the inorganic <lb/>components. The organic layer was separated and evaporated <lb/>in vacuo after which the products were dried under high <lb/>vacuum and characterized by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. <lb/>NMR titration was performed by obtaining a saturated <lb/>solution of 1a in water by sonicating ∼7 mg of the compound <lb/>in 2 mL D 2 O followed by removing the ppt through a syringe <lb/>filter. Then, 0.6 mL of the filtered solution was subject to <lb/>NMR titration with an addition of the powder form of <lb/>cyclodextrin(s). Concentration of the saturated solution of 1a <lb/>in water was sufficient enough to be observed in the <lb/>spectrometer at with 64 scans. <lb/>Computational chemistry of the reactant and its host-guest <lb/>complexes with cyclodextrin was performed using Gaussian &apos;09 <lb/>software package. Structures of host-guest complexes were <lb/>calculated using the ONIOM multilevel theory function in the <lb/>software. The host molecules (CDs) were treated at the <lb/>molecular mechanics level (UFF) and the guests were treated <lb/>at the HF 6-31G basis set. Geometric optimizations and <lb/>frequency calculations were performed in the gas phase. All <lb/>normal mode frequencies of optimized structures were <lb/>positive. <lb/>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Iodocyclization Reaction. Mixtures of copper sulfate and <lb/>sodium iodide generate molecular iodine (I 2 ) in situ, and the <lb/>cyclization of 2-phenethynylanisole (1a) is initiated by the <lb/>electrophilic interaction of I 2 with the alkyne. The mechanism <lb/>of iodocyclization reaction is understood to proceed via the <lb/>formation of a cyclic iodinium intermediate 3a (Scheme <lb/>2). 23-25 This electrophilic attack triggers the electrocyclization <lb/>process involving nucleophilic assistance from the conforma-<lb/>tionally predisposed ether functionality in the molecule.

		<body>concomitant oxonium ion intermediate 4a reinstates its <lb/>neutrality through the loss of the methyl group in the presence <lb/>of the prospective counter-anion in the medium. Due to the <lb/>involvement of an electrophilic attack in the first step and <lb/>cationic intermediate that is in conjugation with aromatic rings, <lb/>substituents with electronic effects greatly influence the <lb/>reaction rates; electron donating groups increase the reaction <lb/>rate, whereas electron withdrawing groups reduce the rate. <lb/>Reaction in Homogeneous Aqueous Slurry and <lb/>Organic Solvents. Results from the experiments performed <lb/>at different reagent concentrations, temperatures, and <lb/>durations are outlined in Table 1. It is evident that even <lb/>though the reaction mixture was heterogeneous (the reagents <lb/>and substrates were not in the same macrophase) significant <lb/>conversion was realized. This was an intriguing finding, as the <lb/>common knowledge in organic synthesis is that maximization <lb/>of the reaction speed requires complete solubility of the <lb/>reactants. While this finding was surprising, trends in the <lb/>influence of physical factors on the extent of conversion were <lb/>as expected; conversions increased progressively with time, <lb/>with an increase in concentration of reagents, and at higher <lb/>temperatures. <lb/>The conditions employed in the slurry reactions presented <lb/>in Table 1 are moderate. Near-quantitative conversion (greater <lb/>than 90%) was achieved at room temperature and in the <lb/>presence of 5 equiv of copper sulfate and sodium iodide for 24 <lb/>h. Presence of slightly lesser amounts of reagents (3 equiv) still <lb/>resulted in moderate conversions of around 50%. The extent of <lb/>the reaction was significantly higher than that observed for the <lb/>same reaction in organic media (vide infra). This observation <lb/>provides an applied significance for our work due to its <lb/>enhancement of the reaction rate as well as its green chemistry <lb/>aspect; our work is now expected to be an example, among few <lb/>others, where the reaction rate is higher in aqueous media <lb/>compared to that in organic solvents. However, the most <lb/>notable aspect of the experimental findings is that the reaction <lb/>proceeds to a significant extent in an environmentally benign <lb/>solvent, and that without the need of solubilizing agents such <lb/>as surfactants or crown ethers. <lb/>To gain perspective regarding the efficiency of the slurry <lb/>reaction, we compared the iodocyclization conversions to <lb/>those in traditional reaction conditions, such as a solution in <lb/>the organic solvent. Hence the experimental conditions <lb/>outlined above were employed, except in this case where <lb/>alcoholic organic solvents were used. Table 2 lists the <lb/>conversions achieved in various solvents and binary solvent <lb/>mixtures. The reaction conversions were overall significantly <lb/>lower than those observed using aqueous slurry conditions. <lb/>The conversions in pure organic solvents at room temperatures <lb/>were quite low, wherein for the same duration, the conversion <lb/>in the slurry was at least five folds higher. Similarly, the <lb/>conversions were many folds higher at elevated temperatures, <lb/>as well as in the presence of increased equivalents of the <lb/>reagents. A comparison of the data in Tables 1 and 2 clearly <lb/>establishes the fact that the reaction proceeds with a higher <lb/>rate and improved efficiency in the aqueous environment than <lb/>in the organic solvent. Time-dependent reaction conversion <lb/>experiment followed by NMR provides a clear perspective on <lb/>the progress of the reaction (Figure S4, Supporting <lb/>Information) where the ratio between proton signals of <lb/>phenylene (2a) and the methoxy (1a) is proportional to <lb/>reaction conversion. The importance of water in enhancing the <lb/>reaction rate is evident from the second entry in Table 2, <lb/>wherein a 50% v/v mixture of methanol in water was used as <lb/>the reaction medium. The reaction conversion increased <lb/>noticeably (about three times higher) and was comparable to <lb/>that of the reaction in water. <lb/>Supramolecular Influence on Reaction Rate. While <lb/>solubility of the inorganic reagents in water increases, solubility <lb/>of the substrate is starkly reduced. We hypothesized that <lb/>increasing the solubility of the substrate, acting like a phase-<lb/>transfer catalyst (PTC), might increase the reaction rate using <lb/>solubilizing agents. Cavitands, especially cyclodextrins, have <lb/>been used for this purpose. One specific example is the <lb/>enhancement of the rate of cyclization of o-aminobenzamides <lb/>due to its encapsulation reported by Wu et al. 26 It is especially <lb/>relevant due to its structural similarity involving ring closure to <lb/>form a five-membered benzofuran ring, in which the authors <lb/>demonstrated the role of CDs acting as a PTC as well as a <lb/>possible catalyst in stabilizing the reactant transition state. <lb/>Expecting a similar effect in our reaction involving cyclization <lb/>of an o-substituted substrate, we employed cyclodextrins to act <lb/>as a PTC thereby increasing reaction rates (Figure 2). Three <lb/>cavitands from the cyclodextrin family were used to solubilize <lb/>the reactant in the aqueous environment (Figure 3). <lb/>Cyclodextrins (CD) are bucket-shaped oligomeric structures <lb/>composed of glucopyranose units (Figure 3, left). The <lb/>hydroxyl groups of the gluropyranose on the circumference <lb/>Figure 2. Encapsulation of aminobenzamides with ketones enhances cyclization through stabilization of the transition state. 26 Presence of a similar <lb/>effect was explored in this iodocyclization cyclization of alkynyl anisoles. <lb/>Figure 3.

		<body>of the upper and lower rims of the CD render the molecule <lb/>water-soluble, while the inner hydrophobic cavity encapsulates <lb/>smaller organic compounds, such as the substrate (1), in water. <lb/>The hexameric, heptameric, and octameric oligomer macro-<lb/>cycles are termed α-, β-, γ-CD respectively. <lb/>The electrocyclization was performed in aqueous under <lb/>identical conditions at room temperature as discussed earlier in <lb/>the presence of 3 equivalents of each CD oligomer (Table 3). <lb/>Whereas, near quantitative conversion was achieved in an <lb/>aqueous slurry reaction in 24 h, inclusion of substrate 1a within <lb/>the smallest oligomer, α-CD, resulted in a 2.4 fold decrease in <lb/>conversion. This was contradictory to the expected rate <lb/>enhancement based on the originally hypothesized PTC <lb/>advantage. Similar outcome was observed for the next larger <lb/>oligomer β-CD, though the decrease in reaction rate was not as <lb/>dramatic. The effect of the largest oligomer, γ-CD, continued <lb/>in the same trend, except in this case an enhancement in <lb/>reaction rate was observed compared to the slurry reaction. <lb/>Near quantitative conversion was observed for γ-CD in less <lb/>than 20 h, a significantly higher conversion than the <lb/>corresponding reaction for water in 24 h. This suggested that <lb/>the effect of CDs on the reaction rates were highly dependent <lb/>on their cavity sizes suggesting a strong supramolecular control <lb/>on the reaction mechanism as opposed to a simple PTC <lb/>phenomenon. <lb/>Computational Chemistry. We aimed to understand the <lb/>effect of CDs on the reaction rates based on the computed <lb/>geometry of inclusion complexes. Geometry-optimized struc-<lb/>tures of reactants, products, and their complexes with β-<lb/>cyclodextrin (all in gas phase) were studied. Initial analysis of <lb/>the computational structures of the reactant 1a optimized in <lb/>gas phase (HF 6-31G, Figure 4) and in an aqueous medium <lb/>(SE PM6, Supporting Information) suggested that the <lb/>molecule could adopt two possible conformations correspond-<lb/>ing to a local minima: one in which the methyl group is <lb/>pointed away from the alkyne group (conformation 1, C1), <lb/>and the second in which the methyl group is pointed towards it <lb/>(conformation 2, C2). Conformation 2 was less stable than <lb/>conformation 1 in both levels of theory, perhaps due to the <lb/>possible increased steric interaction between the methyl and <lb/>alkynyl groups. Based on this information, we realized that our <lb/>in silico studies should involve complexes of reactants with the <lb/>CDs in C1 and C2 conformations as well. <lb/>ΔΔ <lb/>=Δ <lb/>-Δ <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/>stabilization <lb/>nonreactive conf <lb/>reactive conf <lb/>(1) <lb/>In the nonreacting conformation (C1), the methyl group is <lb/>pointed perpendicular to the alkynyl moiety while in the <lb/>reactive conformation (C2) it is pointed away, resulting in <lb/>oxygen&apos;s lone pair predisposed for cyclization. The energies of <lb/>geometry optimized structures of both conformations in the <lb/>three CD hosts were performed in two-level ONIOM <lb/>calculation with the lower level theory (MM, UFF) applied <lb/>to host and the higher-level theory (HF-6-31G) applied to the <lb/>guests. Geometry-optimized structures in the gas phase <lb/>suggested that both phenyl and the anisole rings are <lb/>conveniently encapsulated within the host cavities. For our <lb/>analysis, we studied only structures in which the anisole ring is <lb/>encapsulated as an influence on its conformation will have the <lb/>most influence on its mechanism. <lb/>Comparing the geometry-optimized structure of the reactant <lb/>conformations C1 and C2 included within the cavitand <lb/>provided a possible explanation for the observed change. For <lb/>the unbound reactant, computational chemistry suggests that <lb/>the preferred conformation is the reactive geometry, <lb/>presumably due to coplanarity of lone pairs for conjugation. <lb/>Frequency calculations on the geometry-optimized structures <lb/>allowed us to evaluate the thermochemistry of the isomeric <lb/>complex structures: C1@CD vs C2@CD (Figure 5). <lb/>Comparison of the free energies of the complex formation <lb/>showed that as the cavitand size increases the stability of <lb/>reactive conformation decreases and that of the nonreactive <lb/>conformation increases (Figure 6). If stabilization of the <lb/>reactive geometry (due to oxygen predisposition) is the only <lb/>factor, then α-CD would be the most reactive and γ-CD the <lb/>least; however, experimentally this is not the case. Therefore, <lb/>the second factor that would influence the reaction rate is the <lb/>accessibility of the molecular iodine to the alkyne moiety to <lb/>form the cyclic iodonium intermediate. Based on the analysis <lb/>of complex structures it is evident that as the size of cavitand <lb/>increases, the ability of iodine to react with the substrate would <lb/>increase. While all CDs enhance the solubility of the substrate, <lb/>the limited cavitand volume of α-CD also imposes a steric <lb/>barrier on the I 2 -substrate interaction, which reduces reactivity. <lb/>On the other hand, the larger cavity volume of γ-CD is able to <lb/>simultaneously encapsulate the substrate and the reagent while <lb/>also conferring the solubility advantage for the host without <lb/>imposing a steric hindrance, which increases the reaction rate; <lb/>the ability of γ-CD to form ternary complexes is well-<lb/>documented in literature. <lb/>Empirical Observation of Host-Guest Complex. <lb/>Complex formation was experimentally ascertained through <lb/>NMR host-guest titrations (Figure 7). Compound 1a is soluble <lb/>enough in D 2 O (saturated solution) for 1 H NMR analysis. <lb/>Addition of aliquots of β-and γ-CDs showed peak broadening <lb/>indicating complexation. Surprisingly, there was no observable <lb/>shift in signals, which is unusual. The extent of peak <lb/>Table 3.

		<body>broadening was significant for γ-CD even at 1 equivalent, while <lb/>it was minimal (though noticeable) for β-CD. The extent of <lb/>peak broadening was similar for all nine aromatic protons, <lb/>suggesting complexation of the host to both the phenyl and <lb/>phenoxy sides. The presence of a single set of peaks indicated <lb/>complexation kinetics faster than the NMR time scale, <lb/>consistent with a weak complexation dynamic typically <lb/>observed for CDs in general. <lb/>Complexation of the guest to CDs was further ascertained <lb/>through UV-vis and fluorometric titrations (section D, <lb/>Supporting Information). UV-vis titration of 1a with β-CD <lb/>showed increase in extinction coefficient of the chromophore <lb/>(absorbance increase) with each addition. Similarly, there was <lb/>a significant decrease in fluorescence of the chromophore in <lb/>the presence of the host compared to that of the free guest. <lb/>Spectral analysis of guest 1a in the presence and absence of <lb/>water-soluble hosts indicated inclusion complex formation, <lb/>which considered along with the NMR titration experiments, <lb/>confirmed inclusion of the guest within the cavitand. <lb/>Therefore, the changes in reaction conversion that we observed <lb/>in our experiments were evidently the result of supramolecular <lb/>(weak) interactions between the host and guest. <lb/>Figure 5.

		<body>Effect of Substituents. The effect of substituents on the <lb/>reaction outcome, performed under the reported conditions, <lb/>was explored. Two additional substrates were used, namely 4-<lb/>methoxy-and a 4-cyano-substituted derivatives. As iodocycli-<lb/>zation involves a cationic iodonium intermediate, it is expected <lb/>that electronically activated substrates would enhance the <lb/>reaction rate and vice versa. The 4-methoxy derivative of 1a <lb/>underwent near quantitative conversion in 20 h under <lb/>unmediated conditions, while the 4-cyano derivative resulted <lb/>in no significant conversion under similar conditions (Table <lb/>4). These results were consistent with expectations. Similar to <lb/>the experiments with 1a, the reaction was performed in the <lb/>presence of CDs. Consistent with the earlier findings, the <lb/>reaction conversions were enhanced for all substrates, <lb/>substantiating our hypothesis that the complexation of <lb/>substrates to CDs increases interaction between I 2 and the <lb/>alkynyl bond along with PTC effect. <lb/>■ CONCLUSIONS <lb/>This work reports enhancement of the iodocyclization reaction <lb/>of 1-alkoxyphenyl-2-phenyl acetylene in the presence of copper <lb/>sulfate and sodium iodide to yield the corresponding <lb/>benzofuran. The reaction has been observed to proceed faster <lb/>in an aqueous environment as a homogeneous slurry than in <lb/>the solution in organic solvents. We speculate that this is due <lb/>to the increased solubility of the inorganic reagents in water <lb/>leading to an increase in the local concentration of the <lb/>reactants and reagents. High reaction conversions were <lb/>achieved under moderate conditions in an environmentally <lb/>friendly solvent. We attempted to improve the reaction <lb/>conversions by utilizing solubilizers to enhance the aqueous <lb/>solubility of the substrate, which yielded mixed results: the <lb/>large host γ-CD enhanced reaction rate compared to the aq <lb/>slurry while the smaller hosts showing reduced rates exhibiting <lb/>a clear size-dependent trend. Energy-minimized structures of <lb/>the reactant and the complex suggested that the gradation in <lb/>reaction rates is due to the differential stabilization of two <lb/>different conformations (reactive and nonreactive) of the <lb/>substrate. While all three hosts increase solubility of the <lb/>substrate in water, the smaller hosts also prevent their <lb/>reactivity through steric hinderance; the larger cavity volume <lb/>of γ-CD does not impose such physical limitation, which <lb/>results in an overall rate enhancement. <lb/></body>
