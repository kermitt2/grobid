The bulk <lb/>superconductivity of this compound is confirmed by measurements of the resistivity and <lb/>the a. c. magnetic susceptibility. The H c2 , which is extrapolated to 0 K, is estimated as <lb/>about 0.8 T, using the resistivity measurements under aplied field. The plot of H c2 vs T <lb/>indicates that the Cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles.

			<body>Recently the subject of geometrical frustration in strongly correlated electron <lb/>systems has attracted considerable interest. The ground states of these systems are <lb/>expected to be highly degenerate. Such high degeneracies lead to thermodynamic <lb/>instability at low temperatures. Lifting these degeneracies makes possible the production <lb/>of exotic quantum ground states, such as spin-liquid, heavy fermion, and unconventional <lb/>superconductivity. <lb/>The pyrochlore oxide, which has a general formula A 2 B 2 O 6 O&apos;, contains a tetrahedral <lb/>network of A or B cations, leading to geometrical frustration. The A cations are eight-<lb/>fold coordinated with six O and two O&apos; anions and are located within distorted cubes, <lb/>while the smaller B cations are six-fold coordinated and are located within distorted <lb/>octahedra of which the six bond lengths from the central B cation to the corner O anion <lb/>are equal. The corner-sharing BO 6 octahedra compose a three-dimensional network as <lb/>shown in Fig. 1a. The sublattice of B cations composes a three-dimensional corner-<lb/>shared tetrahedral network, namely, the pyrochlore lattice as shown in Fig.1b. If <lb/>the A cations are non-magnetic and the B cations are magnetic, the B-spin magnetic <lb/>couplings are strongly frustrated under a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange <lb/>interaction. For the case of localized electron spin moments, theoretical studies of the <lb/>Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice have suggested that the ground state of such <lb/>an insulator would be long-range magnetic order[1], spin-freezing[2], or quantum spin <lb/>liquid[3]. The geometrical frustration plays a crucial role even in the case of itinerant <lb/>electrons in the pyrochlore lattice. Indeed, the metallic spinel oxide LiV 2 O 4 , which has <lb/>a pyrochlore lattice of vanadium, has been reported to show heavy fermion behavior at <lb/>low temperatures due to the geometrical frustration[4]. <lb/>A large number of compounds are classified in the family of pyrochlore oxides, and <lb/>these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from insulator <lb/>through semiconductor and from bad metal to good metal[5]. Until now, however, <lb/>no superconductivity has been reported for frustrated pyrochlore oxides. Here, we <lb/>make the first report that a metallic cubic pyrochlore oxide Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 , exhibits type II <lb/>superconductivity at 1.1 K. <lb/>Polycrystalline samples of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 were prepared by solid state reaction. A <lb/>stoichiometric mixture of CdO, ReO 3 , and Re metal was pelletized, and put into an <lb/>alumina Tammann tube. The pellet in the Tammann tube was further inserted into <lb/>an evacuated silica tube and preheated at 300˚C for several hours in order to avoid a <lb/>vaporization of the starting materials. Then, the pellet was heated at 1000˚C for several <lb/>hours. The powder XRD pattern measured at room temperature was identified as the <lb/>cubic pyrochlore structure with a lattice parameter a=10.221Å, which is consistent with <lb/>the previous report[6]. <lb/>The direct current (d. c.) electrical resistivity of the sintered sample of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 <lb/>was measured using a standard four-probe technique in the temperature range of 0.3 to <lb/>300 K under applied field from 0 to 2 T. Low-temperature measurements below 1.9 K <lb/>were performed using a 3 He refrigerator. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence <lb/>of the d.c. electrical resistivity of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 under zero applied field. The electrical <lb/></body>

			<body>resistivity shows a steep descent below T * ∼ 200 K. This anomaly at T * was observed <lb/>in the d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurement as well. The origin of this anormaly <lb/>has not been identified. The electrical resistivity drops to zero sharply at the onset <lb/>superconducting temperature T c =1.1 K, and shows effectively zero resistivity below <lb/>1.05 K. Changes of driving electric current density produced slight differences in the <lb/>resistivity below 1.7 K, an effect which may be due to the superconductivity of a small <lb/>amount of impurity rhenium metal (T c =1.7 K). The superconductivity transition at 1.1 <lb/>K is not due to filamentary superconductivity of Re, since the observed critical field is <lb/>much larger than the critical field of Re (0.02 T), as will be described below. The large <lb/>residual resistivity of 4 × 10 −3 Ω•cm may suggest a low carrier density of this system. <lb/>From band calculations, it is pointed out that the system has a very small density of <lb/>states at the Fermi level, which is located within the 5d-band and in the valley between <lb/>the very flat bands of the rhenium 5d electrons[7]. However, the electronic specific heat <lb/>coefficient has been found to be large, i. e., γ=13.3 mJ/Re mol• K 2 [8], indicating that <lb/>heavy quasiparticles are formed due to the spin-frustration in this compound. <lb/>The alternating current (a. c.) magnetic susceptibility was measured by a mutual-<lb/>inductance method at a magnetic field of 2×10 −5 T in the temperature range of 0.3 to <lb/>1.8 K. As shown in Fig. 3, a strong diamagnetic signal (χ&apos;) has been observed below <lb/>1.06 K, which corresponds to the end-point transition temperature of the electrical <lb/>resistivity measurement. The dissipative component χ&quot; shows only a small peak around <lb/>T c , indicating no weak superconducting link between superconducting grains. The <lb/>superconducting volume fraction was estimated roughly as ∼ 50 % at 0.3 K. From this <lb/>experiment, a bulk superconducting state has been strongly confirmed in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 <lb/>below 1.1 K. <lb/>To estimate the superconducting critical field, the magnetic field dependence <lb/>of T c has been determined by resistivity measurements. As the magnetic field was <lb/>applied, the sample maintained zero resistivity until the field reached H c2 . At H c2 <lb/>the superconductivity was quenched abruptly as shown in Fig.4. The value of the upper <lb/>critical field, which is extrapolated to zero temperature in the plot of H c2 vs T (Fig. 4, <lb/>inset) using the WHH model[9], is estimated as H c2 (0)=0.8 T. The superconducting <lb/>coherence length, ξ is expressed as <lb/>φ 0 <lb/>2πH c2 (T ) (where φ 0 is the fluxoid quantum). The <lb/>Pippard coherence length, ξ 0 =h v F <lb/>π∆(0) (where v F is the Fermi velocity, and ∆(0) is <lb/>the superconducting energy gap at T =0 K) was obtained as about 300Å using the <lb/>relation, ξ(T ) = 0.74ξ 0 <lb/>1− T <lb/>Tc <lb/>for a clean superconductor. This compound is considered to <lb/>be a clean superconductor, since the mean free path l is estimated as ∼ 4 × 10 −8 <lb/>m &gt; ξ 0 , using the Drude relation, ρ =h (3π 2 ) <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>e 2 l n − 2 <lb/>3 with resistivity ρ ∼ 4 × 10 −5 Ω• <lb/>m and carrier concentration n ∼ 1 × 10 24 m −3 which is a typical value for metallic <lb/>pyrochlore compounds. The observed large initial slope of H c2 , i.e., 1 <lb/>Tc <lb/>dH c2 <lb/>dT <lb/>T =Tc <lb/>∼ <lb/>1 T/K 2 , indicates that the Cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles, <lb/>since 1 <lb/>Tc <lb/>dH c2 <lb/>dT <lb/>T =Tc <lb/>is proportional to the square of effective mass m * 2 , in agreement with <lb/>the large γ value. This fact suggests, indeed, that frustrated heavy electrons become <lb/></body>

			<body>superconducting in this compound. <lb/>Generally, superconductivity due to a magnetic interaction competes with magnetic <lb/>frustration, since no particular magnetic excitation for a superconducting attractive <lb/>channel exists due to the frustration.
