			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Over the last ten years or so, the advent of large for-<lb/>mat near-infrared (NIR) detectors has made images at <lb/>wavelengths longer than 1 µm relatively easy to obtain. <lb/>New infrared cameras based on these detectors make it <lb/>straightforward to study statistically significant samples <lb/>of galaxies in the NIR (see e.g. de Jong &amp; van der Kruit <lb/>1994). The NIR wavelengths constitute the spectral re-<lb/>gion best adapted to studies of the quiescent stellar com-<lb/>ponent of galaxies, since they trace mass better than do <lb/>optical bands, being less contaminated by the low M/L <lb/>products of recent episodes of star formation. The NIR <lb/>spectral region is also relatively free of effects of dust, as <lb/></body>

			<body> extinction at 1.65 µm is more than seven times lower than <lb/>in the B band (e.g., Landini et al. 1984). On the negative <lb/>side, the sky brightness can be as much as ten magnitudes <lb/>brighter than in the visible; thus more sophisticated and <lb/>time-consuming observing and data reduction techniques <lb/>are required. <lb/>Since 1993 we have used NIR arrays extensively to ob-<lb/>tain images in the H bandpass of galaxies. The observing <lb/>samples were selected by choosing members of the Virgo, <lb/>Coma and A1367 clusters. In addition, we selected a sig-<lb/>nificant population of galaxies in the portion of the &quot; Great <lb/>Wall &quot; which lies in the bridge between Coma and A1367. <lb/>These latter objects can be considered isolated and will <lb/>be used as a control sample for environmental studies. <lb/>Our previous papers concentrated on spiral galaxies. <lb/>About 160 such objects observed with the Calar Alto 2.2 <lb/>m telescope were reported in Gavazzi et al. (1996c; Paper <lb/>I); another 300, observed similarly with the TIRGO 1.5 <lb/>m telescope, are given in Gavazzi et al. (1996b; Paper II); <lb/>and another 102 Virgo galaxies are reported in Boselli et <lb/>al. (1997; B97). More Calar Alto observations of 170 galax-<lb/>ies in the Virgo cluster are given in Boselli et al. (1999, <lb/>Paper IV). In this paper, we present 1.65 µm (H-band) sur-<lb/>face brightness measurements, obtained in 1997 at TIRGO <lb/>equipped with the Arcetri NIR camera ARNICA, of 558 <lb/>galaxies which are primarily of early-type (E-S0-S0a). We <lb/>also provide several repeated measurements of late-type <lb/>objects with previously unreliable photometry. Section 2 <lb/>of the present paper describes the current sample, and <lb/>the observations are outlined in Section 3. Image analysis <lb/>strategies are discussed in Section 4. Preliminary results <lb/>are given in Section 5 and summarized in Section 6. Profile <lb/>decompositions using combinations of exponential profiles <lb/>and de Vaucouleurs laws of the present data and of those <lb/>obtained similarly (Paper I, II, IV and B97) will be given <lb/>in a forthcoming paper (Paper V of this series, Gavazzi et <lb/>al. 1999a). <lb/> 2. Sample selection <lb/> We report on the NIR H band observations of 558 <lb/>optically-selected galaxies, for the most part (457) of <lb/>early-type morphology, found in the regions of the Coma <lb/>Supercluster and of the Virgo cluster. There are 383 early-<lb/>type galaxies in the CGCG catalogue (m  p  ≤ 15.7) (Zwicky <lb/>et al. 1961-68) that are members of the Coma supercluster <lb/>(18  o  ≤ δ ≤ 32  o  ; 11.5  h  ≤ α ≤ 13.5  h  ), according to Gavazzi <lb/>et al. (1999), i.e. with 5000 &lt; V &lt; 8000 km s  −1  . Of these, <lb/>we have observed 372 objects, which constitute 97% of the <lb/>designated sample. <lb/>We also observed 81 of the 98 early-type galax-<lb/>ies brighter than m  p  =14.0 listed in the VCC catalogue <lb/>(Binggeli et al. 1985) which are bona-fide members of the <lb/>Virgo cluster. Thus we have observed 83% of the giant <lb/>early-type galaxies in Virgo. <lb/>The remaining 101 observations of spiral galaxies given <lb/>here do not form a complete sample in any sense. However, <lb/>they are necessary to define a complete data set. When <lb/>combined with data published in Papers I and II (both of <lb/></body>

This parameter de-<lb/>fines the membership to a group/cluster/supercluster: <lb/>CSisol, CSpairs, CSgroups indicate members of the Coma <lb/>Supercluster (5000 &lt; V &lt; 8000 km s  −1  ); CSforeg means <lb/>objects in the foreground of the Coma Supercluster (V &lt; <lb/> 5000 km s  −1  ) and CSbackg means objects in the back-<lb/>ground of the Coma Supercluster (V &gt; 8000 km s  −1  ). <lb/>Galaxies in the Virgo region are labelled following the <lb/>membership criteria given by Binggeli et al. (1993): VCA, <lb/>VCB, VCM, VCW, VCW&apos;, VCSE, VCmem, are members <lb/>to the cluster A or B, to the M, W, W&apos; or South-East <lb/>clouds or are not better specified members to the Virgo <lb/></body>

These diameters are consistent with those <lb/>given in the RC3. For VCC galaxies these are the diam-<lb/>eters measured on the du Pont plates at the faintest de-<lb/>tectable isophote, as listed in the VCC. <lb/>Column 9: morphological type. <lb/> 3. Observations <lb/> The observations reported in this paper were acquired <lb/>with the 1.5 m, f/20 TIRGO telescope from March 13 <lb/>to April 13, 1997, when 32 nights were allocated to the <lb/>present project. Only 22/32 nights were useful, 16 of which <lb/>were entirely or partly photometric. The seeing ranged <lb/>from 1.5 to 3.5 arcsec (FWHM) with a mean of 2.4 arc-<lb/>sec, as shown in Fig. 1. These seeing conditions are mostly <lb/>due to the large pixels (∼ 1 arcsec) of ARNICA at TIRGO, <lb/>and as such represent a necessary disadvantage, because <lb/>they also provide the large field-of-view (4.1×4.1 arcmin  2  ) <lb/>fundamental for our observations. <lb/></body>

The seeing distribution. <lb/> The folded Cassegrain focus of the telescope is <lb/>equipped with the Arcetri NIR camera, ARNICA, which <lb/>relies on a 256  2  NICMOS3 array detector (Lisi et al. 1993; <lb/>Lisi et al. 1996; Hunt et al. 1996). With a pixel size of <lb/>0.97 arcsec, the field-of-view is 4.1×4.1 arcmin  2  . Obtain-<lb/>ing a satisfactory background subtraction is the main dif-<lb/>ficulty of NIR observations. At 1.65 µm, the sky brightness <lb/>at the Gornergrat is ≈ 13.0-13.5 mag arcsec  −2  , and varies <lb/>on time scales comparable with the typical duration of an <lb/>observation (e.g., Wainscoat &amp; Cowie 1992). To achieve <lb/>a brightness limit 8 mag arcsec  −2  fainter than the sky re-<lb/>quires an image in which the deviations from flatness do <lb/>not exceed 0.06%. Thus, data acquisition techniques must <lb/>be able to monitor the sky fluctuations and data reduction <lb/>must take these into account. <lb/>To this end, we used two types of pointing sequences, <lb/>or &quot; mosaics &quot; , according to the size of the galaxy. Galaxies <lb/>with an optical diameter ≥ 1 arcmin were observed using <lb/>a sequence in which half of the time is devoted to the tar-<lb/>get, and half to the surrounding sky (hereafter denoted as <lb/>a type &quot; A &quot; mosaic)  3  . Typically eight on-source pointings <lb/>were alternated with eight on the sky, positioned along <lb/>a circular path around the galaxy and offset by 4 arcmin <lb/>from the source position. The on-source positions were <lb/> &quot; dithered &quot; by 10 arcsec in order to facilitate the elimina-<lb/>tion of bad pixels. To save telescope time, small galaxies <lb/>(with an optical diameter &lt; 1 arcmin were observed with <lb/>a pointing sequence consisting of nine pointings along a <lb/>circular path and displaced from one another by 1 arcmin <lb/>such that the target galaxy is always in the field (hereafter <lb/>denoted as a type &quot; B &quot; mosaic). <lb/>On-chip integration times were set to 6 seconds to <lb/>avoid saturation but to ensure background-limited perfor-<lb/>mance. Total integration times on-source were typically <lb/>400 s and ranged from 150 to 950 s. <lb/>Table 1 gives the parameters relevant to the NIR ob-<lb/>servations as follows: <lb/>Column 10: number of frames N  f  combined to form the <lb/>final image (depending on the adopted mosaic). <lb/>Column 11: number of elementary observations (coadds) <lb/> N  c  .

Photometric calibration <lb/> Observations of the standard stars HD 84800 (H = 7.53 <lb/>mag) and HD 129653 (H = 6.92 mag) from Elias et al. <lb/>(1982) were taken hourly throughout the nights for cali-<lb/>bration purposes. The calibration stars were observed with <lb/>a third pointing sequence (mosaic type &quot; C &quot; ) which con-<lb/>sisted of five positions, starting with the star near the cen-<lb/>ter of the array, followed by positioning the star in each of <lb/>the four quadrants of the array. The telescope was defo-<lb/>cussed to avoid saturation. During the photometric nights <lb/>(i.e. those of march 20, 21, 25, 27, 29, 31 and of April <lb/>1, 2, 6, 7 and 13) the typical uncertainty in the nightly <lb/>calibration is 0.05 mag. Those nights were mostly used to <lb/>observe galaxies with unknown H band photometry. <lb/>In the remaining non-photometric or marginally pho-<lb/>tometric nights we did not rely on the photometric calibra-<lb/>tion; instead we conservatively observed only those galax-<lb/>ies with aperture photometry available from the literature. <lb/>For these galaxies the calibration was derived from the <lb/> &quot; virtual aperture photometry &quot; (see Section 4.1 below). <lb/>Several (108) galaxies were observed in more than one <lb/>night (see Columns 14-17 in Table 1). This was done ei-<lb/>ther to check the photometric consistency, because some <lb/>observations were taken in non-photometric conditions, <lb/>or, if the objects were fainter than average, to obtain a <lb/>longer integration. For these objects we obtained an aver-<lb/>age frame by combining the various sets of observations, <lb/>and using the zero point from the frame(s) taken under <lb/>photometric conditions. <lb/> 3.2. Data reduction procedures <lb/> Since dome exposures cannot be obtained at TIRGO due <lb/>to the vicinity of the telescope secondary ring to the dome, <lb/>the multiplicative correction for the system response, or <lb/>flat-field (FF), was derived daily from the observations. <lb/>Many tens (typically 30 to 40) sky frames taken in sim-<lb/>ilar conditions throughout the night were combined with <lb/>a median filter. The combined frame, normalized to its <lb/>median counts was used as the flat-field frame. <lb/>The reduction procedure varied according to the type <lb/>of mosaic. For type &quot; A &quot; mosaics, the (usually eight) sky <lb/>exposures were combined with a median algorithm to form <lb/>a median sky. For type &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; mosaics, the median <lb/>sky was determined by combining all the frames in the <lb/>pointing sequence. The median algorithm is necessary to <lb/>remove unwanted star and galaxy images in the median <lb/>sky frames. The median sky was first normalized to its <lb/>median, then multiplied by the median counts of the indi-<lb/>vidual target frames. Finally this rescaled frame was sub-<lb/></body>

Such a pro-<lb/>cedure accounts for temporal variations in the sky level <lb/>which are on the order of 5% during a pointing sequence, <lb/>but introduces an additive offset which is subsequently re-<lb/>moved (see below). The sky-subtracted target frames are <lb/>then divided by the FF frame. Each of these corrected <lb/>frames was then analyzed for low-spatial-frequency gra-<lb/>dients, and if necessary, fitted with a two-dimensional 3 <lb/>degree polynomial which was then subtracted. (We care-<lb/>fully checked that this procedure did not produce artificial <lb/>features which could disturb the photometry of the target <lb/>objects). If this process was not effective in removing the <lb/>spatial gradients, the corresponding frames were rejected <lb/>from further analysis. Finally, the corrected frames were <lb/>registered using field stars and combined with a median fil-<lb/>ter which allows bad pixel removal. Foreground stars were <lb/>eliminated by manual &quot; editing &quot; of the target frames.

Isophotal radii, total magnitudes, and concentration <lb/>indices <lb/> Our NIR observations available so far (including those <lb/>given in Papers I, II and IV and in B97) were also analyzed <lb/>using a more sophisticated approach than the one adopted <lb/>here: 1) the surface brightness profiles were derived from <lb/>azimuthally averaged elliptical isophotes with center, ellip-<lb/>ticity and position angle taken as free parameters. 2) the <lb/>surface brightness profiles were decomposed into combina-<lb/>tions of exponential and de Vaucouleurs laws (or double <lb/>exponential profiles) using a fitting algorithm. We pre-<lb/>fer to postpone the discussion of these profile decomposi-<lb/>tions to a forthcoming paper (Paper V of this series; some <lb/>details of the decomposition procedures can be found in <lb/>Scodeggio et al. 1998). However we wish to anticipate here <lb/>a few results which depend on the fitting algorithms only <lb/>as a tool necessary to extrapolate the measured photome-<lb/>try to infinity: i.e. to obtain total magnitudes, concentra-<lb/>tion indexes and also to derive isophotal radii at a given <lb/>limiting surface brightness (20.5 mag arcsec  −2  in this case) <lb/>when the observations do not reach such a limit. <lb/>Table 1 gives the H band measured parameters of the ob-<lb/>served galaxies, as follows: <lb/>Column 18: H  B25  magnitude obtained extrapolating the <lb/>present photometric measurements to the optical diame-<lb/>ter along circular apertures as in Gavazzi &amp; Boselli (1996). <lb/>Column 19: H  c <lb/>B25  magnitude computed at the optical <lb/>diameter (see Column 18) corrected for galactic and <lb/>internal extinction following Gavazzi &amp; Boselli (1996). <lb/>The adopted internal extinction correction is ∆m = <lb/> −2.5 D log(b/a) where D=0.17, as determined in Boselli <lb/>&amp; Gavazzi (1994). <lb/>Column 20: H  T  total H magnitude extrapolated to infin-<lb/>ity along either an exponential or a de Vaucouleurs r  1/4 <lb/> law fitted to the outer parts of the observed radial surface <lb/>brightness profiles (see Paper V for details). <lb/>Column 21: galaxy observed major (r  H  (20.5)) radius (in <lb/>arcsec) determined in the elliptical azimuthally–integrated <lb/>profiles as the radius at which the surface brightness <lb/>reaches 20.5 H–mag arcsec  −2  .

Results <lb/> Based on the observations presented in this work, which <lb/>we reiterate does not comprise a complete sample, we de-<lb/>rive the following preliminary results. <lb/> 5.1. Radii r  H  (20.5) <lb/>The isophotal radii in this work are derived at the 20.5 <lb/>mag arcsec  −2  H-band isophote, which represents a rather <lb/>bright level, even for H-band measurements. For example <lb/>in Paper I and II we were able to measure similar quanti-<lb/>ties one mag arcsec  −2  fainter, i.e. up to 21.5 mag arcsec  −2  . <lb/>This is not due to lower signal-to-noise of the present data <lb/>compared with the past data, but rather to the different <lb/>method adopted for deriving the light profiles. In the pre-<lb/>vious papers the radial surface brightness profiles were de-<lb/>rived by azimuthally integrating the counts in concentric <lb/>elliptical coronae of fixed center and ellipticity up to indef-<lb/>inite radii. Here, instead, the center and ellipticity are kept <lb/>as free parameters and the fitting is halted when the mean <lb/>surface brightness within a given elliptical corona equals <lb/>the corresponding rms. fluctuation. The drawback is that <lb/>the new fitting routine halts at higher surface brightnesses <lb/>than before.

The distribution of the lowest surface brightness <lb/>reached in the outer light profiles, as a function of the exposure <lb/>time. <lb/> The comparison between the isophotal B band <lb/> r  B  (25.0) = (a/2)  25  (B) radii (Gavazzi &amp; Boselli 1996) <lb/>and the infrared r  H  (20.5) isophotal radii determined in <lb/>this work is shown in Fig. 5. Apart from the curva-<lb/>ture apparent at small radii, the data are consistent with <lb/> r  H  (20.5) = 0.7 r  B  (25.0) between these two arbitrary <lb/>isophotal levels. <lb/>This indicates that at the adopted isophotal level, the <lb/>H observations cover a substantial fraction of the light, <lb/>and are not restricted to the bulge. The relationship be-<lb/>tween optical and H-band isophotal radii is consistent with <lb/></body>

			<body> that expected from our limiting H surface brightness of <lb/>20.5 mag arcsec  −2  and with the B–H color of the outer <lb/>portion of normal galaxies. <lb/>The curvature seen in Fig. 5 is only marginally an arte-<lb/>fact of the seeing: the effect is reduced slightly by removing <lb/>the objects observed in the worse seeing conditions. The <lb/>deviation from linearity is not due to an overestimate of <lb/>the H band radii, rather it reflects an underestimate of the <lb/>B band diameter of small (≤ 10 arcsec) early-type galax-<lb/>ies which are intrinsically red (see Paper V for a more <lb/>comprehensive discussion on this issue). <lb/> Fig. 5. The relation between the apparent major isophotal ra-<lb/>dius rH(20.5) as determined in the infrared (this work) and <lb/>in the optical rB(25.0). E+S0 are plotted as open circles, <lb/>S+Irr as filled circles. The solid line represents the relation <lb/> rH(20.5) = 0.7 rB(25.0). <lb/> 5.2. Magnitudes (H  T  , H  B25  ) <lb/> H  B25  magnitudes listed in Column 18 of Table 1 are ob-<lb/>tained by extrapolating the circular aperture measure-<lb/>ments to the optical r  B  (25.0) radius (as in Gavazzi &amp; <lb/>Boselli 1996). H  T  mag instead are obtained by extrapo-<lb/>lating to infinity the magnitude integrated along elliptical <lb/>isophotes using combinations of exponential and de Vau-<lb/>couleurs laws. As expected, H  T  are brighter than H  B25  by <lb/>0.10 ± 0.2 mag on average. <lb/> 5.3. Concentration index (C  31  ) <lb/> The concentration index C  31  is a measure of the shape <lb/>of light profiles in galaxies, independent of a bulge–disk <lb/>decomposition. Values larger than C  31  &gt; 2.8 indicate the <lb/>presence of substantial bulges. <lb/>We confirm the presence in our sample of a general <lb/>correlation between C  31  and the H band (H  T  or H  B25  ) <lb/>luminosity (computed from the redshift distance). We find <lb/>that C  31  generally increases toward higher absolute mag-<lb/>nitudes (Fig. 6). High C  31  are found only among high lu-<lb/>minosity systems, but the converse is not true: there are <lb/>several high luminosity systems (namely late–type giant <lb/>spirals) with no or little bulge (C  31  ∼ 3). <lb/> 6. Summary <lb/> We have obtained images in the near-infrared H bandpass <lb/>for an optical-magnitude-selected (m  p  ≤ 15.7) sample of <lb/>558 nearby (z &lt; 0.02) galaxies primarily of early-type, <lb/>in the regions of Coma and Virgo.
