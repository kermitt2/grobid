			<body>Introduction <lb/>Globally, malaria affected 216 million individuals in 2016 and resulted in 445,000 deaths [1]. <lb/>Amongst non-endemic countries, the UK has one of the highest numbers of imported malaria <lb/>in Europe with around 1500 cases a year [2]. Despite a decreasing trend in the overall global <lb/>number of cases, it remains the most common imported infection in returning ill travellers in <lb/>Europe [3]. <lb/>In the UK, malaria is a notifiable disease and information on trends over time is usually <lb/>obtained from passive surveillance data on imported cases from the Malaria Reference Labora-<lb/>tory (MRL), supplemented more recently with cases reported to the Public Health England <lb/>(PHE) case management database (HPzone) [2, 4]. Reports on cases are completed by clini-<lb/>cians and laboratory staff with information on patient demographics, reason for travel, area <lb/>and duration of travel, and chemoprophylaxis use [5]. This surveillance method is associated <lb/>with underreporting since not all cases who seek healthcare are notified. A capture recapture <lb/>study estimated that only 56% of cases were captured by the MRL surveillance system [6], <lb/>with similar levels of underreporting in other European notification based surveillance systems <lb/>[7-9]. <lb/>Use of electronic health records (EHRs) may provide a complementary method of explor-<lb/>ing trends in malaria diagnoses over time. Although they have limitations, EHRs have been <lb/>widely used for observational research and several studies have used them for exploring trends <lb/>in the incidence of illnesses over time [10-13]. Data collection at the time of recording a <lb/>malaria diagnosis in primary care can result in the inclusion of unreported cases in the analysis <lb/>as it forgoes the added step of notification. Furthermore, it can provide insight into the num-<lb/>ber of cases seen in this setting. <lb/>Our aims were to investigate the incidence of imported malaria in the UK between 2005 <lb/>and 2016 using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) Primary care database; to explore <lb/>the variation in incidence by age, sex, UK region, socioeconomic status and ethnicity; and to <lb/>compare the characteristics of cases identified in THIN to those identified through passive <lb/>surveillance. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Data source <lb/>Relevant data were extracted from THIN. THIN contains anonymised EHRs of around 12 mil-<lb/>lion patients attending 693 general practices participating in the network [14]. It has coverage <lb/>of around 6% of the UK population and has been shown to be broadly representative of the <lb/>UK population in terms of demographics and prevalence of major conditions [15]. Data in <lb/>THIN are collected routinely from consultations in general practice and consist of information <lb/>on individual patient characteristics, medical information such as symptoms and diagnoses of <lb/>disease, investigations ordered and medication prescribed. Data are coded using Read codes, a <lb/>standard vocabulary list clinician&apos;s use to record medical information; and drug codes, based <lb/>on the British National Formulary classifications for medication. <lb/></body>

			<body>Study population <lb/>General practices that contributed data to THIN between January 2005 and December 2016 <lb/>were used for this study. The quality of the data included was assessed using the acceptable <lb/>computer usage (ACU) dates [16] and the acceptable mortality recording (AMR) dates [17]. <lb/>The ACU date refers to the date when general practices use their computer systems adequately <lb/>for recording clinical data. In THIN, this was defined as the date where at least one medical <lb/>record, one additional health data (AHD) record and two therapy records are consistently <lb/>recorded per patient per year[16]. The AMR date refers to the date from which the mortality <lb/>recordings of a general practice are deemed complete. In THIN, this was defined as the date <lb/>the mortality recordings within the general practice was similar to what the expected mortality <lb/>would be in the general population using the Office for National Statistics data, taking into <lb/>account the characteristics of the patients within that practice [17]. Practices were included <lb/>after the latter of the ACU and AMR date. Additionally, information on postcode linked socio-<lb/>economic indices (Townsend Score) was not available for 17 practices and they were excluded <lb/>from the analysis. <lb/>Participants <lb/>All individuals aged 0-99 years that were registered with a general practice contributing data <lb/>between 2005 and 2016 were included in the analysis. <lb/>Case definition. Cases of malaria in primary care may be indicated by diagnostic codes, <lb/>or a combination of investigation and treatment codes. An algorithm was developed to identify <lb/>individuals diagnosed with malaria within THIN based on having any of the following records <lb/>(Fig 1): <lb/>• A diagnostic Read code for malaria: <lb/>A Read code list indicating a diagnosis of malaria was developed (S1 Table). Those with a <lb/>malaria diagnostic Read code within their medical records were considered to have a diagno-<lb/>sis of malaria. The date that malaria was first recorded was considered the index date of <lb/>diagnosis. <lb/>• A code for malaria investigation followed by treatment for malaria within 60 days: <lb/>In order to capture potential cases that did not have a diagnostic Read code for malaria, <lb/>those with an AHD code or Read code for malaria specific investigations were identified <lb/>(S1 Table). In records where a laboratory test is ordered with no result reported in THIN, it <lb/>was assumed that the individual had a diagnosis of malaria if an antimalarial was prescribed <lb/>within two months after the date the test was ordered. The antimalarials prescribed were <lb/>identified using a drug code list developed based on chapter 5.4.1 of the British National For-<lb/>mulary (BNF) (S1 Table) [18]. Although some of these medications can be used for prophy-<lb/>laxis, the preceding indication for ordering the malaria specific investigation makes this <lb/>unlikely. The date the antimalarial was prescribed was considered the index date of diagnosis <lb/>in those who were investigated for malaria. <lb/>• A prescription for artemesinin-based combination therapy (ACT). <lb/>Artemesinin-based combination therapy is the recommended treatment for those with P. <lb/>falciparum infection and for non-falciparum malaria if the area of infection is known to have <lb/>chloroquine resistance [19]. The drug codes in THIN were searched to identify all ACTs <lb/>recorded in the database and only artemether-lumefantrine was identified. Artemether-<lb/>lumefantrine is the drug of choice for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum and is licensed <lb/>solely for the treatment of malaria [18]. It was assumed that the individual had a diagnosis of <lb/></body>

			<body>malaria if they received a prescription for artemether-lumefantrine. The date this was pre-<lb/>scribed was considered to be the index date of diagnosis. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>The overall crude incidence of malaria was estimated per 100,000 person years at risk (PYAR). <lb/>This was determined by totalling the number of patients with a first recording of malaria <lb/>between 2005 and 2016, and then dividing this number by the total person years of follow-up <lb/>for all patient records for this period. The start date used to calculate the total PYAR for each <lb/>participant was the latest of: <lb/>• The date the individual registered with their current general practice <lb/>• The date the practice reached AMR <lb/>• The date the practice reached ACU <lb/>• The 1 st of January 2005 <lb/>The end date used to calculate the total PYAR for each participant was the earliest of: <lb/>• The date the individual transferred to a different practice to the one included in the analysis. <lb/>• The date of death recorded in the practice. <lb/>Fig 1.

The score ranges from 1 <lb/>to 5 with 1 being the least deprived and 5 indicating the greatest degree of deprivation) region <lb/>(based on former strategic health authority location; London, East Midlands, East of England, <lb/>North East, North West, Northern Ireland, Scotland, South Central, South East Coast, South <lb/>West, Wales, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber) and ethnicity (Grouped into the <lb/>2001 UK census 5 category classification: White, Black, Asian, Other and Mixed) were also <lb/>estimated by restricting the person years of follow-up to the respective category in question. <lb/>Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was carried out to explore the change in incidence <lb/>by calendar year, age group, sex, region and Townsend score mutually adjusting for the other <lb/>variables included in this model. Ethnicity was not included in the model as the data quality <lb/>was poor with missing data in 40% of cases. To fit the Poisson model to calculate a rate ratio, <lb/>the coefficients were exponentiated with person-time specified as the exposure. <lb/>Additionally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to take into account multiple episodes of <lb/>malaria in the same individual. It was considered an individual had an additional episode of <lb/>malaria if they had a diagnostic Read code for malaria at least three months after the previous <lb/>recording. In these individuals, the start date used to calculate PYAR commenced three <lb/>months after the date of the previous event as they were not considered to be at risk during <lb/>that three month period. <lb/>All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata version 14 [20]. <lb/>Comparison with national surveillance data <lb/>Data on the number of malaria cases imported to the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2016 by <lb/>UK region was obtained from the PHE Travel and Migrant section. In the absence of an equiv-<lb/>alent denominator for PYAR to estimate incidence for PHE data, we compared the number of <lb/>cases by year and UK region as a proportion of the total number of cases for each dataset from <lb/>2005 to 2016 to describe the variation in the number of cases identified over time, and their <lb/>geographical spread in THIN compared to those notified to PHE. <lb/>Ethics <lb/>THIN data collection has been approved by the South East NHS Multicentre Research Ethics <lb/>Committee. Scientific approval for this study was obtained from the IMS Heath Scientific <lb/>review committee in 2016 (ref: SRC 16THIN056). <lb/>Results <lb/>A total of 1,806 individuals with a first diagnosis of malaria were identified in THIN between <lb/>2005 and 2016, with 1,474 cases included in the final analysis after excluding those with a code <lb/>for a travel vaccination on the index date of diagnosis or were missing sociodemographic data. <lb/>A summary of the number of cases identified at each stage of the algorithm is shown in (Fig 2). <lb/>The incidence of recorded malaria followed a decreasing trend dropping from a rate of 3.33 <lb/>in 2005 to 1.36 cases per 100,000 person years at risk in 2016 (Fig 3).

			<body>in those aged 20 to 69 compared to those less than 20 years or more than 70 years of age <lb/>(Table 1). Men experienced a higher rate of recorded malaria than women (IRR: 0.72 (95% CI <lb/>0.65-0.80), incidence per 100,000 PYAR; men 2.57, women 1.81). General Practices in London <lb/>and the East of England had the highest incidence (6.15 and 2.51 per 100,000 PYAR respec-<lb/>tively), while practices in Northern Ireland were 89% less likely to have a recording of malaria <lb/>compared to London (IRR: 0.11 (95% CI 0.07-0.18), incidence per 100,000 PYAR: 0.63) <lb/>(Table 1, S1 Fig). Greater deprivation was associated with a higher recording of malaria com-<lb/>pared to those who were less deprived (IRR: 1.86 (95% CI 1.54-2.25), incidence per 100,000 <lb/>PYAR; most deprived: 3.29, least deprived: 1.48). <lb/>Ethnicity was poorly recorded in THIN with missing data on 40% of the cases included in <lb/>the analysis (Table 1). Amongst those with a recording of ethnicity, those who identify as black <lb/>had the highest incidence while those who identified as white had the lowest (56.14 and 1.40 <lb/>per 100,000 PYAR respectively). Those with unrecorded ethnicity data had a similar rate as <lb/>those who identified as white (1.38 vs 1.40 per 100,000 PYAR). <lb/>Fig 2. Number of cases identified in THIN from 2005 to 2016.

			<body>The sensitivity analysis looking at multiple episodes within the same individual identified <lb/>nine individuals with two episodes and one individual with more than two episodes of <lb/>recorded malaria within the study period. Including these episodes in the analysis had no sig-<lb/>nificant effect on the results. <lb/>Comparison with national surveillance data <lb/>There were a total of 18,833 cases of malaria identified by PHE through the MRL and HPZone <lb/>between 2005 and 2016. Comparing the proportion of cases identified by each dataset per year, <lb/>there was a proportionately larger number of cases identified in THIN between 2005 and 2009 <lb/>compared to PHE and a proportionately smaller number of cases in THIN for more recent <lb/>years (2014 to 2016) (Fig 4A). In terms of region, there was a larger representation of cases <lb/>from London in PHE (57%) compared to THIN (32%) (Fig 4B). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This study showed that the incidence of malaria recordings in primary care significantly <lb/>decreased between 2005 and 2016. Adults of working age were three times as likely to have a <lb/>diagnosis of malaria compared to children and older adults. Men were 28% more likely to have <lb/>a diagnosis of malaria compared to women. London had the highest incidence of malaria in <lb/>the UK and those who were most deprived were 86% more likely to be diagnosed with malaria <lb/>compared to those who were least deprived. <lb/>Findings of this study were similar to other data from the UK [2, 21], however the rate of <lb/>decline in the number of cases was more pronounced compared to data from the national <lb/>review for malaria, where annual case numbers have remained stable over the last 10 years [2]. <lb/>Fig 3.

			<body>The lack of a denominator in our comparison of THIN and PHE data meant that variations <lb/>over time could either reflect changes in the number of cases identified; or changes in the <lb/>number of individuals where the cases derived from. Therefore the more pronounced decline <lb/>in THIN could partly be due to the improvement in data quality with regards to the complete-<lb/>ness of PHE data. Since 2013, cases reported to the PHE case management database (HPZone) <lb/>supplemented the cases identified in the MRL dataset. In addition, the number of cases identi-<lb/>fied in THIN may be underestimated for 2016 since not all practices contributed data for that <lb/>year, further contributing to the declining trend. Despite this, it is likely that our findings <lb/>reflect a true decline in the number of cases since 2005. Decreasing global malaria incidence <lb/>[1], decreased transmission of malaria in West Africa, where most cases in the UK are acquired <lb/>and changing chemoprophylaxis usage have been suggested as possible factors contributing to <lb/>the decline [22, 23]. <lb/>Similar to data from national and European surveillance [2, 24], men were more likely to <lb/>present with malaria than women. Previous studies have suggested that gender differences in <lb/>attitudes towards seeking pre-travel health advice [25], poorer adherence to malaria chemo-<lb/>prophylaxis [26], increased risk taking behaviour and travel to more remote areas where the <lb/>risk of contracting malaria is higher may account for the male predominance in the number of <lb/>malaria cases [27]. On the other hand, other studies have shown no gender differences in che-<lb/>moprophylaxis uptake and adherence [28] and suggest that host factor differences resulting in <lb/>increased attractiveness to mosquitoes may be responsible for the higher rate of malaria in <lb/>men [26]. Although both, behavioural and biological host factors may be contributory, the <lb/>main reason for the difference is likely due to the number of individuals who travel as between <lb/>2014 and 2016, 17% more men travelled to malaria endemic areas from the UK than women <lb/>[29]. Similarly, age differences in malaria rates may also reflect UK travel patterns [29]. <lb/>Although we were unable to adjust for ethnicity in our analysis due to a large amount of <lb/>missing data, the trends in the rates of recordings where data were available was comparable <lb/>with other UK data, showing higher rates in ethnic minorities (Black, mixed, Asian and other, <lb/>respectively) compared to those who were White[2, 21]. Additionally, those with missing eth-<lb/>nicity data had a similar rate of malaria recording in THIN as those who were white suggesting <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>that the majority of those with missing data were white. Furthermore, those diagnosed with <lb/>malaria could be more likely to have their ethnicity recorded compared to those who are not, <lb/>resulting in an inflated value for the incidence rate amongst ethnic minorities. Also, given that <lb/>ethnic minority populations are more likely to be found in London and are more likely to <lb/>experience deprivation [30, 31], ethnicity may account for the higher incidence of malaria in <lb/>London and in those who were most deprived. <lb/>Fig 4.

			<body>Use of EHRs for malaria research could provide a complementary role to data obtained <lb/>through passive surveillance. The characteristics of each data source and their respective <lb/>strengths and limitations are summarised in (Table 2). For THIN, the large number of individ-<lb/>uals included in the analysis allowed us to accurately compare primary care incidence esti-<lb/>mates by age, sex, gender, region, socioeconomic status and calendar year. Additionally, the <lb/>use of routinely collected prospective data to estimate incidence potentially captured cases not <lb/>reported in surveillance based incidence estimates, since it relies on clinicians recording a <lb/>diagnosis of malaria regardless of whether it had been notified to Public Health England or <lb/>MRL. It also resulted in a more accurate estimation of the geographic distribution of cases <lb/>since the centralised reporting site for MRL make it less sensitive to cases resident outside of <lb/>London [6]. On the other hand, relying on clinician recording of the diagnosis also meant that <lb/>it was difficult to look at the incidence of malaria by parasite species since the species of <lb/>malaria were rarely recorded. Moreover, although our algorithm captured cases without a <lb/>diagnostic code for malaria by looking at other variables such as treatment and investigations <lb/>and excluded those with a code for a travel related vaccination, there still remains a risk of <lb/>some misclassification if a diagnosis of malaria was not considered. Furthermore, our use of <lb/>GP records for the analysis of incidence meant that our findings are restricted to those <lb/>Table 2. summarising the characteristics, strengths and limitations of using PHE data and primary care EHR (THIN) data. <lb/>PHE <lb/>THIN <lb/>Data source <lb/>Passive surveillance through MRL (supplemented by HPZone <lb/>since 2013) [2] <lb/>Primary care electronic health records <lb/>Case definition for <lb/>malaria case <lb/>Parasitological confirmation of diagnosis by blood film or tissue <lb/>histology.

			<body>registered with a general practitioner. Using an additional data source from secondary care <lb/>(Hospital Episode Statistics, HES) could have resulted in additional information on parasite <lb/>species and identified further cases not recorded in THIN [32]. However, the limited number <lb/>of practices in THIN with linkage to HES (23% of practices) and the lack of HES-linked data <lb/>for practices outside England would have restricted the number of individuals included in the <lb/>study [33]. Despite this, future research on the subset of individuals with HES linked data <lb/>could provide insight into the levels of recording in both settings. Finally, the number of <lb/>malaria recordings is not a true reflection of incidence since only those who travel are at risk of <lb/>contracting malaria, however, in the absence of reliable data regarding travel in THIN, includ-<lb/>ing all individuals when looking at the rate of malaria recordings allows us to explore trends <lb/>over time and compare with surveillance data which also uses population data [2, 24]. <lb/>This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, which has explored malaria recordings <lb/>over time using UK primary care data. The comparability of our findings to that from other <lb/>UK data sources supports the use of this routinely collected data source for further research. <lb/>Since the majority of previous malaria related research is retrospective [35], the routine <lb/>recording in primary care datasets can allow prospective evaluation of the sequence of care <lb/>prior to a diagnosis amongst the cases identified in this study. Given that prompt diagnosis <lb/>and treatment of malaria remains a challenge in primary care [36], future research can use pri-<lb/>mary care data to identify missed opportunities for diagnosis and explore factors associated <lb/>with it. Additionally, the improved geographic information on the distribution of cases can <lb/>help with resource allocation and delivery of malaria prevention and treatment services. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>There has been a decrease in the number of malaria recordings in UK primary care over the <lb/>past decade. This decrease exceeds the rate of decline reported in national surveillance data; <lb/>however there are similar associations with age, sex and deprivation. Improved geographic <lb/>information on the distribution of cases and the potential for automation of case identification <lb/>suggests that EHRs could provide a complementary role for investigating malaria trends over <lb/>time. <lb/>Supporting information <lb/>S1 Fig. Incidence of malaria recording by UK region in THIN. <lb/>(DOCX) <lb/>S1 Table.
