			<body>Background &amp; Summary <lb/>Freshwater ecosystems are facing a global biodiversity crisis 1 . Despite only 0.01% of the Earth&apos;s surface water <lb/>occurring as freshwater ecosystems, these systems harbor 7% of the world&apos;s described species and one third of all <lb/>vertebrates 2,3 . Yet these same ecosystems are facing alarming rates of habitat and biodiversity loss. Even among <lb/>freshwater ecosystems, rivers and streams are considered numerically rare despite providing disproportionate <lb/>services to society, ultimately leading to their over-exploitation 4 . Much of the exploitation of lotic systems is <lb/>directly related to the manipulation of natural streaflow variability. For instance, roughly 50% of rivers and <lb/>streams across the world are hydrologically altered from their natural state 5,6 , with as much as 80% of streams <lb/>in Canada 7 and 80% of streams in the conterminous US 8 displaying signs of alteration in streamflow regimes. <lb/>By 2050, climate change is expected to have altered streamflow regimes in as much as 80% of the global terres-<lb/>trial land surface aside from that already altered from human infrastructures 9,10 -only exacerbating decades of <lb/>declines in freshwater fauna populations 11 . The monumental challenge faced by modern society is &quot;bending the <lb/>curve&quot; of freshwater biodiversity loss, all while addressing climate change mitigation and human population <lb/>growth 1 . <lb/>In their Emergency Recovery Plan for dampening or reversing declines in freshwater biodiversity, Tickner <lb/>et al. 1 lay out several major actions, the first being the widespread implementation of environmental flows, i.e., <lb/>the quantity and timing of streamflow volumes required to sustain the ecological integrity of river systems. With <lb/>competing demands for limited water quantities, the inevitable question that follows is &quot;How much water do <lb/>river [ecosystems] need?&quot; 12,13 . Prescribing environmental flows for rivers requires understanding dependen-<lb/>cies or linkages between essential stream flow components (e.g., magnitude, duration, frequency of flows) and <lb/>ecological processes. Even more critical is understanding ecological responses to human-induced alterations <lb/></body>

			<body>to naturally variant streamflow regimes -generally termed &quot;flow-ecology relationships&quot; 14 . At a regional level, <lb/>flow-ecology relationships, especially thresholds or tipping points of streamflow alteration, can be used as gen-<lb/>eral guidelines for environmental flow implementation and preventatives for over-extraction -this general pro-<lb/>cess has been formalized as the Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) framework 15 . The ELOHA <lb/>framework has been implemented in at least 20 US states and several countries 16 ; however, a practical demand of <lb/>developing empirical flow-ecology relationships include identifying datasets with sufficient empirical observa-<lb/>tions. A commonly reported shortcoming of regional ELOHA studies is the limited availability of information to <lb/>support the development of flow-ecology relationships, either from the scientific literature 14 or from pre-existing <lb/>inventories of biological surveys and hydrologic records 17 . <lb/>Imposing restrictive criteria on observation datasets dramatically reduces sample sizes and generalizations <lb/>that can be drawn from the data. For example, in a nationwide study evaluating flow-ecology relationships, only <lb/>237 (3%) of 7,000 US Geological Survey gaging locations had co-occurring macroinvertebrate or fish sampling <lb/>surveys 8 . One solution to ameliorate the data-shortage issue is to increase the volume and density of systematic <lb/>biological surveys; however, US federal and state-funded systematic biological surveys are already considered <lb/>regionally comprehensive (&gt;1.5 million sampling events) yet provide high-quality survey data for only 13% <lb/>of US streams 18 . Even marginal increases in the percentage of surveyed streams would come at great cost to <lb/>resources. A more economical solution is to model expected hydrologic and ecological conditions in ungauged <lb/>stream reaches to fully leverage the wealth of existing hydrologic and biological data 19 . For instance, George et <lb/>al. 17 used modeled estimates of hydrologic conditions in streams to yield a nationwide flow-ecology dataset of <lb/>6,452 observations -a value almost 9 times the observations reported in a comparable study relying on overlap-<lb/>ping biological surveys and hydrological data 20 . Obviously, a limitation of such an approach is the uncertainty <lb/>of modeled versus observed hydrologic conditions and subsequent error propagation that arises in developing <lb/>flow-ecology relationships 19 . <lb/>Given the importance of ensuring region-wide extensions of the ELOHA framework, especially in <lb/>data-limited regions, a comprehensive dataset of modeled hydrologic conditions or hydrologic alteration val-<lb/>ues and ecological consequences, mapped to the stream-reach resolution, would be valuable to the research <lb/>and practitioner community. Not only could such a dataset address limitations of contemporary flow-ecology <lb/>relationship development, but it expedites the entire 4-step scientific components embodied within the ELOHA <lb/>process and provides substantial time-savings for researchers and managers. Herein, we present a dataset of <lb/>modeled hydrologic (streamflow) alteration, summarized in 43 metrics, and resulting estimates of losses in fish <lb/>species richness for 2.6 million stream reaches within the conterminous US. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Overview of hydrologic and ecological mapping protocol. Mapping hydrologic and ecological alter-<lb/>ation at the stream reach level followed a 7-step process that builds upon several previously published methods <lb/>(Fig. 1). The steps include: (1) compiling a nationwide dataset of streamflow gauges from the US Geological <lb/>Survey (USGS) and distinguishing reference and non-reference gages and associated records 21-23 , (2) assembling <lb/>stream flow records and calculating hydrologic indices 23 , (3) quantifying hydrologic alteration for stream gages 22 , <lb/>(4) developing models to predict hydrologic alteration from human disturbance variables 24 , (5) using models to <lb/>Reference <lb/>Non-Reference <lb/>Hydrologic <lb/>alteration <lb/>Hydrologic <lb/>metric <lb/>Observed <lb/>Expected <lb/>Hydrologic <lb/>Alteration <lb/>Models <lb/>Human <lb/>Infrastructures <lb/>Land Cover <lb/>Change <lb/>Mapping Hydrologic Alteration <lb/>in Stream Reaches <lb/>Fish <lb/>Richness <lb/>Residual <lb/>Fish community <lb/>sampling <lb/>Fish <lb/>Richness <lb/>Drainage <lb/>Area <lb/>Hydrologic <lb/>Alteration <lb/>Threshold <lb/>Hydrologic <lb/>alteration <lb/>Fish Richness <lb/>Residuals <lb/>+ <lb/>-<lb/>0 <lb/>Step 1 <lb/>Step 2 <lb/>Step 3 <lb/>Step 4 <lb/>Step 6 <lb/>Step 5 <lb/>Step 7 <lb/>Fish Richness <lb/>Response <lb/>Fig. 1 Overview of the 7-step approach used to map hydrologic alteration and ecological consequences in <lb/>stream reaches of the conterminous US. <lb/></body>

			<body>extrapolate hydrologic alteration to ungauged stream reaches 24 , (6) developing empirical models of fish species <lb/>richness responses to hydrologic alteration 17 , and (7) mapping fish richness responses to ungauged stream reaches <lb/>based on modeled estimates of hydrologic alteration. Methodological details are provided in each of the publi-<lb/>cations cited above; however, an overview of the steps is provided here. We elaborate more fully on the detailed <lb/>methodology starting at step 3, as this reflects more of the focus of the technical validation of the dataset (Fig. 1). <lb/>Step 1 -Compiling a nationwide streamflow dataset. We assembled streamflow information for 7,088 USGS <lb/>stream gages with at least 15 years of daily discharge data as of 2010. We only included gages with at least 15 <lb/>years of complete annual records (i.e., those with &lt;= 30 days of missing daily data). The influence of climate <lb/>variability on hydrologic statistic values dampens as periods of records increase, and typically, at least 15 years <lb/>of record are required to stabilize variation in indices, at least to acceptable levels for spatial analyses 25 . However, <lb/>a noted limitation of our analysis is that we did not formally control for climate variation in the calculation of <lb/>hydrologic statistics from stream records varying in length and duration, as compared to Eng et al. 26 . However, <lb/>Eng et al. 26 found that climate variability had minimal influence on hydrologic alteration at stream gages relative <lb/>to human land and water management. <lb/>Gages were partitioned into reference (n = 2,249) and non-reference (n = 4,839) condition based on geo-<lb/>graphical evaluations of human disturbance regimes in basins upstream of each gage, reviews of USGS water <lb/>reports, and visually inspecting flow duration curves 21,22 . For ease of terminology, we use the term &quot;reference&quot; to <lb/>indicate the &quot;least disturbance&quot; condition for a region, as defined by Stoddard et al. 27 . For streams currently reg-<lb/>ulated by dams and with at least 15-yr records extending prior to dam regulation (n = 250), streamflow records <lb/>were partitioned into pre-and post-dam construction time periods 22 . Except for pre-dam construction records, <lb/>periods of record for reference conditions displayed considerable temporal overlap (at least 50% of overlap in <lb/>records) 23 , as did periods of record for non-reference conditions 22 . <lb/>Step 2-Assembling streamflow records and calculating hydrologic statistics. Daily streamflow records were <lb/>obtained from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) website (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ <lb/>nwis). For reference streams, the entire period of record was used for calculating hydrologic statistics, whereas <lb/>for non-reference gages, only periods overlapping with contemporary human disturbance regimes were used <lb/>(1980-2010) due to the temporal limitations of anthropogenic disturbance variables used to predict hydro-<lb/>logic alteration. The National Hydrologic Assessment Tool (www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5387735ee-<lb/>4b0aa26cd7b5461) was used to calculate 110 hydrologic statistics summarizing the magnitude, frequency, <lb/>duration, timing, and rate of change in flow for all reference and non-reference stream flow records 23 . <lb/>Step 3-Calculating hydrologic alteration indices at gages. Calculating hydrologic alteration at non-reference <lb/>gages first required estimating reference or natural hydrologic conditions as a baseline from which the degree of <lb/>alteration could be assessed. Of the 110 hydrologic statistics above, we selected 41 indices that adequately rep-<lb/>resent the multi-dimensional nature of regional variation in hydrologic across the US 23 and have been used in <lb/>previous assessments of hydrologic alteration 22 (Table 1). These 41 indices include the Indicators of Hydrologic <lb/>Alteration 12 , a series of non-redundant metrics representing the predominant variation embodied by almost 200 <lb/>hydrologic variables 28 . Since the 41 indices are univariate summaries of hydrologic conditions, two additional <lb/>indices, a hydrologic alteration index and a seasonality alteration index, were calculated to represent multivar-<lb/>iate impacts to overall variation among hydrologic metrics and the distribution of monthly flows, respectively <lb/>(more details provided in Step 3 expanded). <lb/>Generally, reference condition values of hydrologic indices were estimated for non-reference gages using ran-<lb/>dom forest statistical models constructed from reference gauges or gauges with pre-dam hydrologic records 22 . <lb/>Random forest model performance was high with a median variance explained of 91% among all hydrologic <lb/>indices and median normalized RMSE of 0.513 22 (normalized RMSE by range of values). In cases where statis-<lb/>tical models were unreliable (i.e., indices depicting timing of low and high flows), non-reference stream gages <lb/>were assigned to a hydrologic class representing a range of reference condition index values 22 . In these situa-<lb/>tions, the 90 th percent confidence interval of hydrologic index values represented by all reference gauges within <lb/>a hydrologic class was used to represent the reference flow condition. Observed hydrologic indices were then <lb/>compared to estimated reference conditions to calculate hydrologic alteration indices, characterizing the degree <lb/>of changes in stream flow due to human influence (see next section). <lb/>Step 4 and 5 -Predicting hydrologic alteration and mapping to U.S. streams. Random forest models were con-<lb/>structed to predict each hydrologic alteration index at stream gages using an ensemble of human disturbance <lb/>variables summarized in the upstream basins contributing to each gage. Predictor variables included landcover, <lb/>dam storage, infrastructure, and water withdrawals (Supplementary Table 1). Random forest models were devel-<lb/>oped for the entire US and for each of 29 ecohydrologic regions (Fig. 2), which represent unique combinations <lb/>of Freshwater Ecoregions 29 and two-digit hydrologic unit codes (i.e., major river basins). The same human dis-<lb/>turbance variables were compiled in the networks upstream of all NHDplus V1 stream reaches (https://nhd-<lb/>plus.com/NHDPlus/NHDPlusV1_home.php) and models were then applied to predict hydrologic alteration <lb/>in those reaches. Values were then extended to NHDplus V2 stream reaches (https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/ <lb/>get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data) using crosswalk tables. <lb/>Step 6 and 7 -Predicting and mapping ecological responses to hydrologic alteration in stream <lb/>reaches. Comprehensive maps of hydrologic alteration in stream reaches provide a foundation for subsequent <lb/>modeling efforts, such as evaluating ecological responses to altered streamflow. Once these flow-ecology rela-<lb/>tionships are developed for multiple regions, ecological conditions, similar to hydrologic conditions, can be <lb/></body>

			<body>extrapolated to stream reaches. Recently, George et al. 17 used the same hydrologic alteration indices reported <lb/>in this study to develop regionally explicit nationwide flow-alteration-ecological-response relationships. These <lb/>models were used to extrapolate ecological conditions (i.e., losses in fish species richness) to the stream reach <lb/>resolution based on modeled hydrologic alteration values. <lb/>Step 3 expanded: Calculating hydrologic alteration indices for stream gages. We elaborate on the <lb/>above methodology, starting here with step 3. We used two approaches for calculating hydrologic alteration for <lb/>non-reference stream gages 24 . For the majority of indices (Table 1), we calculated hydrologic alteration as propor-<lb/>tional changes of observed (O) index values (i.e., human-altered conditions), versus expected (E) index values (i.e., <lb/>reference conditions) in the equation: (O -E)/E 30 . Hence, indices ranged from −1 to values» 1. Performance, as <lb/>measured by area-under-the-curve (AUC), of preliminary models using these raw values were lower than desired <lb/>(AUC &lt; 0.7). Hence, following Eng et al. 30 , we scaled values from 0 to 1 to represent a likelihood of hydrologic <lb/>alteration in the following fashion. For indices &lt; = 1, we used the absolute value of (O -E)/E, whereas indices &gt;1 <lb/>were assigned maximum values of 1. For reference gages, hydrologic alteration values were set to 0 for each metric. <lb/>While the above measures are informative for individual flow components, indices that summarize the <lb/>multi-dimensional nature of stream flow alterations provide convenient single measures of alteration. We calcu-<lb/>lated a seasonality index, analogous to Zaerpour et al. 7 , representing shifts in the monthly flow magnitudes, as <lb/>cumulative differences in observed (O) and expected (E) values for all mean monthly flows using the following <lb/>equation: <lb/>O <lb/>E <lb/>E <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>(1) <lb/>m i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>12 <lb/>∑ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>− <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>= <lb/>Index <lb/>Definition <lb/>Magnitude of flow events <lb/>MA1 <lb/>Mean Daily Flow <lb/>MA2 <lb/>Median Daily flow <lb/>MA3 <lb/>Variability in daily flows <lb/>MA12-23 <lb/>Mean monthly flow for all months, January (12) through December (23) <lb/>MA41 <lb/>Mean annual runoff <lb/>ML17 <lb/>Baseflow 1.

			<body>calculate the HAI, all 110 hydrologic metrics (step 2 above) for reference and non-reference gages were cen-<lb/>tered, scaled from 0 to 1, and assessed in a principal components analysis (PCA) 24 . Thirteen of the components <lb/>were significant according to the broken-stick method 31 . We partitioned the 13 principal component scores by <lb/>hydrologic class membership and calculated 90 th percentile confidence intervals for only reference streams. The <lb/>confidence interval (a…b) for significant PC scores (S) is represented by the lower (a) and upper (b) bounds. For <lb/>each non-reference gage and each significant PC, we calculated a rank (r) value using the following: <lb/>≤ ≤ <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>a <lb/>S <lb/>b <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>V <lb/>If <lb/>is true then <lb/>0, otherwise <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>Where V i is the eigenvalue for the i th significant PC.

Random forests 32 were <lb/>constructed to model all hydrologic alteration indices as binomial distributions using 50 predictor variables <lb/>summarizing natural characteristics and human disturbances, such as landscape alteration and infrastructures <lb/>(Supplementary Table 1, see 24 ). Random forests are a form of machine learning where large numbers of decision <lb/>trees are constructed in an iterative fashion using a bootstrapped subsample of observations and subsets of vari-<lb/>ables 32 . The remaining observations are termed the out-of-bag (OOB) sample, which is used in cross-validation <lb/>measurements of variance explained, error, and variable importance. Each tree is constructed from training data <lb/>and then predictions are combined among all trees. We used the randomForest package 33 in the R programming <lb/>environment to develop tree-based models for the entire US (all gauges) and separately for each ecohydrologic <lb/>region. Hence, with 43 hydrologic indices and 29 regions, over 1,000 forest models were generated. Predictor <lb/>variables used in models are classified into 8 groups (number of variables in parentheses): urbanization (14), <lb/>agriculture (10), dams and reservoirs (6), power generation (6), dischargers and flow modifiers (5), human dis-<lb/>turbance indices (3), basin size, stream size, and climate (3), and natural land cover (3) (Supplementary Table 1). <lb/>Predictor variables were obtained from multiple sources or our own geospatial analysis and were summarized for <lb/>both the local catchment surrounding each stream reach containing the stream gauge or were accumulated for the <lb/>entire catchment contributing to each gauge (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, the same predictor variables were <lb/>compiled for all 2.6 million NHDPlus V1 stream reaches, both for local catchments and entire stream networks <lb/>upstream of each reach. Following construction and calibration, random forest models were used to extrapolate <lb/>hydrologic alteration values to all 2.6 million NHDPlus V1 stream reaches in the CONUS (Fig. 2). Using cross-<lb/>walks between NHDPlus V1 and V2, we extended hydrologic alteration values to NHD Plus V2 stream reaches. <lb/>Step 6 and 7 expanded: Ecological alteration models and mapping. To develop flow-alteration-<lb/>ecological response relationships, George et al. 17 developed a comprehensive dataset of overlapping hydrologic <lb/>and ecological data for 6,452 stream reach locations. At each location, measures of hydrologic alteration and <lb/>ecological alteration were compiled, where ecological alteration was measured as the deviation in observed native <lb/>fish richness from expected natural conditions 17 . Flow-alteration-ecological-response relationships typically <lb/>adopt a &quot;wedge-shaped&quot; distribution well-suited for quantile regression 34 . Hence, George et al. generated quantile <lb/>regression models predicting 50 th , 75 th , and 95 th percentile alterations in fish richness from hydrologic alteration <lb/>values for all hydrologic metrics, except HAI, within each 4-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC-4), except water-<lb/>sheds where limited sample size prohibited model development (12% of watersheds). <lb/>Quantile regression model coefficients for each hydrologic metric within each HUC4 were used to predict <lb/>alterations in native fish richness at the stream reach resolution based on modeled estimates of hydrologic alter-<lb/>ation. In situations where coefficients were unavailable for HUC-4s, average model coefficients for entire ecohy-<lb/>drologic regions were used. Residuals in fish richness were calculated for each hydrologic alteration metric (e.g., <lb/>Fig. 3a). Flow thresholds or tipping points represent hydrologic alteration values beyond which ecological deg-<lb/>radation is expected 13 or can be deemed socially unacceptable 15 . Presuming that loss of any native fish species is <lb/>unacceptable, the hydrologic alteration value at which residuals in fish richness &lt;0 is considered the threshold <lb/>or limit. Based on the quantile regression models 17 , thresholds were identified and applied to all stream reaches <lb/>based on HUC-4 or ecohydrologic region. Modeled hydrologic alteration values for each metric were compared <lb/>to each respective threshold in each stream reach to yield a binary response where losses in fish biodiversity are <lb/>expected (1) or not (0), depending on if the hydrologic threshold was exceeded. The mean value among these <lb/>responses for all hydrologic alteration metrics yields a probability of fish biodiversity loss (Fig. 3b), ranging from <lb/>0 to 1, based on all components of the flow regime. <lb/></body>

			<body>Data Records <lb/>All data records available and their file structure are described in Table 2. Modeled estimates of hydrologic <lb/>alteration for all 43 metrics and estimates of fish biodiversity loss in response to each metric (except HAI) are <lb/>provided at the NHDPlus stream-reach resolution in .csv or .txt files. Each row entry includes the corresponding <lb/>stream reach identifiers (i.e., COMIDs) for both NHDPlus V1 and V2 versions. Given that fish species richness <lb/>responses were modeled for many hydrologic alteration metrics, the median and extreme fish biodiversity loss <lb/>values across all metrics, in addition to binary and probability measures of fish biodiversity loss, are also pro-<lb/>vided for each stream reach. Estimates of hydrologic alteration are provided separately for different modeled <lb/>outcomes, including the random forests developed for all gauges in the US and the aggregated results from all <lb/>forests developed for each ecohydrologic region. Likewise, the fish species richness response data are provided in <lb/>two datasets for reach set of responses, one for the entire US and one for the aggregated regional results. The data <lb/>are generally split into two or four regional sub-datasets for the entire CONUS. Random forest model perfor-<lb/>mance measures, including AUC values and relative importance of predictor variables are also provided in .csv <lb/>files, both for the entire-US model and for each ecohydrologic region model.

AUC values represent cross-validation measures, as predictions from model trees are taken from the <lb/>out-of-bag (OOB) sample, representing roughly 33% of observations, modeled in that forest. AUC values are <lb/>appropriate for evaluating the performance of hydrologic alteration models as the indices range from 0 to 1; <lb/>however, AUC evaluation requires a binary classifier as the control from which to measure performance. In this <lb/>case, we used two binary control measures to calculate AUC values: a binary categorization of reference and <lb/>non-reference gages (measure 1), and a categorization of high (index &gt; 0.5) and low (index &lt; = 0.5) hydrologic <lb/>alteration values in the empirical observations (measure 2). Relative importance (RI) of variables in predicting <lb/>hydrologic alteration indices was also measured from the OOB sample as the average decrease in mean squared <lb/>error (MSE) rates across all permutations of a given variable among all trees.

			<body>indices, groups of predictor variables, and regions. MSE values for all random forest models are provided in <lb/>Supplementary Material 1. <lb/>AUC values for models developed for the entire US averaged 0.87 and ranged from 0.72 to 0.91 for measure <lb/>1, whereas for measure 2, AUC values averaged 0.82 and ranged from 0.78 to 0.88 (Fig. 4, results also available <lb/>via 35 ). Performance for models developed for individual ecohydrologic regions varied considerably. For meas-<lb/>ure 1, AUC values averaged 0.87 and ranged from 0.5 to 0.998 depending on the hydrologic index (Fig. 4a) and <lb/>region (Fig. 4b). For measure 2, AUC values averaged 0.81 and ranged from 0.53 to 0.995 (Fig. 4c,d). Variation <lb/>in model performance seemed to be related to intrinsic properties of each region and less influenced by different <lb/>hydrologic indices. Differences in model performance was not influenced by the gauges available for model <lb/>construction. For instance, there was no relationship between the number of observations (number of gauges) <lb/>and average variation explained in hydrologic indices for each ecohydrologic region. <lb/>The relative importance of predictor variables in explaining variation in hydrologic indices was also explored. <lb/>Climate and natural basin characteristics, such as drainage area and precipitation, were the most important pre-<lb/>dictor variables, followed by variables characterizing dams (e.g., dam storage, degree of regulation). Landcover <lb/>variables were of moderate importance, whereas energy infrastructure and water discharges (unrelated to dam <lb/>regulation) were of minor importance (Fig. 5a). With a few exceptions, variation in importance among models <lb/>within a region generally mirrored the overall importance of variables, where basin and climate variables had <lb/>higher variation in importance, followed by dam-related variables (Fig. 5b). <lb/>As a second and coarse validation of hydrologic alteration, we compared our nationwide rates of hydro-<lb/>logic alteration from our assessment to three other nationwide assessments of hydrologic alteration, conducted <lb/>at either the stream-gage or stream-reach level 8,26,36 . Comparing rates of alteration among different assess-<lb/>ments requires establishing common hydrologic alteration thresholds, which, in the case of Carlisle et al. 8 , was <lb/>&gt; = 10% change in hydrologic indices from reference conditions. Carlisle et al. found that 86% of stream gages <lb/>showed signs of at least 10% deflated mean annual minima and maxima values. Based on our assessment, 93% <lb/>of stream gages had alteration values of &gt; = 0.1 for DL1 (1-day annual minimum), 66% of gages with &gt; = 0.1 for <lb/>DH1 (1-day annual maximum), and 96% of gages considering both DL1 and DH1. In contrast to Carlisle et al., <lb/>our analysis considers both decreases and increases to hydrologic metrics as a measure of alteration. Extending <lb/>the comparison to stream reaches, approximately 74% of U.S. stream mileage, on average (79% median), across <lb/>all hydrologic indices had hydrologic alternation values equal or exceeding 10%. According to the hydrologic <lb/>alteration index (HAI), 79% of streams were hydrologically altered, whereas the mean daily flow index (MA1) <lb/>indicated 81% of streams were altered. <lb/>Eng et al. 26 conducted a thorough study of hydrologic alteration at stream gages and reported percentages <lb/>of non-reference gages displaying alteration for twelve hydrologic metrics, some of which were compatible <lb/>with those used in our study, although none were identical (Supplementary Material 2, Table S1). Aside from <lb/>differences in the metrics used, the scale of values used in Eng et al. &apos;s approach to measure degrees of hydro-<lb/>logic alteration differed from our approach and required some adjustment to be compatible for comparison <lb/>(Supplementary Material 2, Table S2). Generally, the frequency of non-reference stream gages displaying degrees <lb/>of alteration for various flow components in our study agreed relatively well with that of Eng et al. (Fig. 6). <lb/>Carlisle et al. 36 used machine learning models to extend Eng et al. &apos;s stream gage assessment to the stream reach <lb/>level and reports that 1.2 million km, or roughly 38% of streams have &quot;modified flows&quot;.

			<body>threshold 13 was used, then our dataset suggests 57% of streams are hydrologically altered based on HAI values <lb/>&gt; = 0.2 (note: HAI is a more comprehensive measure of 110 hydrologic metrics, compared to the 12 reported <lb/>in Eng et al.). Collectively, despite inconsistencies in approaches, these comparisons suggest that our hydrologic <lb/>alteration assessment is within reasonable estimates of other nationwide assessments. <lb/>Validation of the ecological alteration data required consideration of compounding error arising from both <lb/>the hydrologic alteration models and quantile regression models. Hence, cumulative uncertainty in fish biodi-<lb/>versity loss can stem from error in the quantification of hydrologic alteration thresholds, as well as estimation of <lb/>hydrologic alteration. Using mean-square error (MSE) rates for each random forest model, modeled hydrologic <lb/>alteration estimates HA <lb/>( ) were adjusted for each stream reach by subtracting or adding MSE values (from ran-<lb/>dom forest models), yielding minimum HA <lb/>( ) and maximum HA <lb/>( ) values, respectively, for each hydrologic met-<lb/>ric. For quantile regression models, standard error values for slope coefficients were used to vary slopes to yield <lb/>minima T <lb/>( ) and maxima T <lb/>( ) threshold values for each hydrologic metric.

As <lb/>such, the data can be useful for exploring the frequency of alteration in the landscape according to hydrologic <lb/>or biologically meaningful spatial units (e.g., species ranges), and can support aquatic species GAP analyses or <lb/>prioritization for areas of flow restoration. Data are provided in accessible .csv formats and summarized at the <lb/>NHDplus stream-reach scale.

An important consideration is the interpretation of hydrologic alteration <lb/>values, which have been standardized from 0 to 1. As such, these are not directly translatable as measures of <lb/>hydrologic alteration.
