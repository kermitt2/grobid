			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Background. Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise <lb/>microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial <lb/>resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are <lb/>many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR <lb/>gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic <lb/>data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing <lb/>depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study <lb/>we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the <lb/>same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential <lb/>environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and <lb/>sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~200 million <lb/>reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of <lb/>Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing <lb/>(short-and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to <lb/>the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-<lb/>source software pipeline, &apos;ResPipe&apos;. <lb/>Results. Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth <lb/>than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve <lb/>&lt;1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 <lb/>million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different <lb/>AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of <lb/>AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per <lb/>sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene <lb/>length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially <lb/></front>

			<body>BACKGROUND <lb/>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health threat (1,2) and <lb/>understanding the evolution, emergence and transmission of AMR genes <lb/>requires a &apos;One Health&apos; approach considering human, animal and <lb/>environmental reservoirs (3). Methods for profiling species and AMR gene <lb/>content in samples from these niches can be broadly categorised as either <lb/>culture-dependent or culture-independent. Culture-dependent methods have <lb/>the advantage of isolating individual strains for detailed analysis, but hugely <lb/>underestimate species and AMR gene diversity. Culture-independent <lb/>methods typically involve shotgun metagenomics, in which the DNA of a <lb/>complete microbial community in a sample is extracted and sequenced, and <lb/>the sequencing reads are used to estimate AMR gene and/or species <lb/>distributions. The advantage of shotgun metagenomics is its relative lack of <lb/>bias, but it tends to be less sensitive than targeted, culture-based or molecular <lb/>approaches identifying specific drug-resistant isolates or AMR genes of <lb/>interest (4-6). <lb/>Problems in characterising the epidemiology of AMR are exemplified by the <lb/>Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria. This family contains over 80 genera, <lb/>and includes many common human and animal pathogens, such as <lb/>Escherichia coli, that can also asymptomatically colonise human and animal <lb/>gastrointestinal tracts, and are also found in environmental reservoirs (7). <lb/>The genetic diversity of some Enterobacteriaceae species is remarkable: in E. <lb/>coli, it has been estimated that only ~10% of the 18,000 orthologous gene <lb/>families found in the pangenome are present in all strains (8). AMR in <lb/></body>

			<body>Enterobacteriaceae is mediated by &gt;70 resistance gene families, and &gt;2,000 <lb/>known resistance gene variants have been catalogued (9,10). In addition to <lb/>mutational resistance, AMR genes are also commonly shared both within and <lb/>between species on mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences, <lb/>transposons and plasmids. Individuals have been shown to harbour multiple <lb/>diverse AMR gene variants, strains and species of Enterobacteriaceae in their <lb/>gastrointestinal tract (11,12), highlighting that single-colony subcultures do not <lb/>recover the true AMR reservoir even within a small subsection of a microbial <lb/>community. <lb/>Attempting to near-completely classify AMR gene and species diversity by <lb/>any culture-based approach for raw faeces, effluent, and river sediment is <lb/>therefore unlikely to be feasible; hence, the use of shotgun metagenomics to <lb/>achieve this aim. However, the replicability of metagenomic surveys and the <lb/>sequencing depth (reads per sample) required to analyse these sample types <lb/>has not yet been explored in detail (13,14). <lb/>Motivated by the need to analyze large numbers of these samples in the <lb/>REHAB study (http://modmedmicro.nsms.ox.ac.uk/rehab/), here we carried <lb/>out a pilot study (Figure 1) to investigate: (i) the replicability of sequencing <lb/>outputs using common DNA extraction and sequencing methods; and the <lb/>impact of (ii) widely used taxonomic and AMR gene profiling approaches; (iii) <lb/>sequencing depth on taxonomic and AMR gene profiles; and (iv) sequencing <lb/>depth on the recoverability of genetic contents from isolates identified in the <lb/>same samples using culture-based approaches. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>Impact of sequencing depth on AMR profiles <lb/>Metagenomic sequencing produced approximately 200 million metagenomic <lb/>150bp paired-end reads per sample i.e. over 56 gigabases per sample <lb/>(Supplementary Table 1), of which &lt;0.05% of reads mapped with 100% <lb/>identity to a known AMR-related sequence (see next section). The number of <lb/>reads mapping to AMR gene families was largest in pig caeca (88,816 reads) <lb/>and effluent (77,044 reads). Upstream sediment did not have enough AMR-<lb/>related reads for further analysis (49 reads). <lb/>The effluent sample had the highest total richness of both AMR gene families <lb/>and AMR allelic variants (Figure 2). Sequencing depth significantly affected <lb/>the ability to evaluate richness of AMR gene families in effluent and pig caeca, <lb/>which represent highly diverse microbial environments. The number of AMR <lb/>gene families observed in effluent and pig caeca stabilized (see Methods: <lb/>&apos;Rarefaction curves&apos;) at a sequencing depth of ~80 million reads per sample <lb/>(depth required to achieve 95% of estimated total richness, ùëë !.!&quot; : 72-127 <lb/>million reads per sample). For AMR allelic variants in effluent, the richness did <lb/>not appear to have plateaued even at a sequencing depth of 200 million reads <lb/>per sample, suggesting the full allelic diversity was not captured (ùëë !.!&quot; : 193 <lb/>million reads per sample). <lb/>Specific mapping to AMR genes and allelic variants <lb/>We exploited the hierarchical structure of the Comprehensive Antimicrobial <lb/>Resistance Database (CARD) to assign reads to their respective AMR gene <lb/></body>

			<body>families and AMR allelic variants using a specific read mapping strategy i.e. to <lb/>count only reads which mapped to a unique region of an allele or a gene <lb/>family. In order to place a lower bound on the AMR diversity present, we <lb/>adopted a stringent approach which counted only alignments with 100% <lb/>sequence identity to CARD sequences. The resulting AMR gene family <lb/>profiles differed significantly between the samples (Figure 3). The most <lb/>abundant AMR gene families in effluent and pig caeca were &quot;23S rRNA with <lb/>mutations conferring resistance to macrolide&quot; and &quot;tetracycline-resistant <lb/>ribosomal protection protein&quot;, respectively. There were 10,631 and 733 reads <lb/>assigned to a &quot;multiple gene family&quot; category in the effluent and pig caeca, <lb/>respectively. These represent reads that were mapped across multiple AMR <lb/>gene families and therefore could not be uniquely assigned to any single <lb/>family. <lb/>Reads that mapped to one specific AMR gene family but onto multiple allelic <lb/>variants (i.e. could not be assigned to one specific allele) were classified as <lb/>&quot;multiple alleles&quot;. There was evidence of high allelic diversity, including among <lb/>clinically relevant AMR gene families. For example, 47.7% of the reads <lb/>mapped to the &quot;OXA beta-lactamase&quot; family could not be assigned to a <lb/>specific allele (4,466 out of 9,357 reads; third-most abundant gene family by <lb/>reads). Similarly, the most abundant gene family by reads in pig caeca was <lb/>&quot;tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection protein&quot;, and 35.8% of the reads <lb/>that mapped within this family could not be assigned to a specific allele <lb/>(18,228 out of the 50,886 reads). <lb/></body>

			<body>Impact of normalisation strategies on AMR allelic variant abundances <lb/>Normalising by gene length (see Methods: &apos;Normalisation of gene counts&apos;) <lb/>had a profound effect on the distributions and the ranking order of AMR allelic <lb/>variants in general (Figure 4). Further normalisation by T. thermophilus reads <lb/>did not affect the per sample distributions of AMR allelic variants, but it <lb/>allowed more accurate comparison between samples by estimating absolute <lb/>abundance of any given variant in the sample. The number of reads that <lb/>mapped to T. thermophilus were similar between three samples, and this <lb/>meant that the changes were small (i.e. a slight relative increase in the <lb/>effluent compared to the pig caeca sample). While most of the alleles had <lb/>lateral coverages between 90% and 100% in effluent and pig caeca samples <lb/>(Figure 3, right panels), &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis 23S rRNA with mutation <lb/>conferring resistance to macrolide antibiotics&quot; had lateral coverage of 29% <lb/>despite being one of the most abundant alleles in the effluent. <lb/>Impact of different assignment methods on taxonomic composition <lb/>While Centrifuge overall classified more reads than Kraken, both methods <lb/>showed a similar trend of effluent having a greater proportion of reads <lb/>classified as bacterial compared to upstream sediment, which had more than <lb/>pig caeca (Figure 5a). Apart from Centrifuge classifying noticeably more <lb/>Eukaryota and Viruses (0.7% and 0.05% respectively) than Kraken (0.09% <lb/>and 0.01% respectively), a large proportion of reads from both methods were <lb/>unclassified (70.0% and 83.3% for Centrifuge and Kraken respectively). The <lb/>proportions of recoverable bacterial 16S rRNA fragments were low for all <lb/>samples (0.16%, 0.23% and 0.04% for effluent, pig caeca and upstream <lb/></body>

			<body>sediment samples respectively), highlighting that shotgun metagenomics is an <lb/>extremely inefficient method for obtaining 16S rRNA gene sequences. <lb/>The bacteria phylum-level classication (Figure 5b) showed structural <lb/>differences among all three classification methods. The overall community <lb/>structure and composition were more similar between Kraken and Centrifuge <lb/>than the &apos;in silico 16S&apos; approach (see Methods: &apos;Taxonomic profiling&apos;). This <lb/>was particularly apparent in the upstream sediment, where using &apos;in silico 16S&apos; <lb/>produced distinctively different community profiles from the other methods. <lb/>Kraken and Centrifuge classified between 377,675 to over 4 million reads as <lb/>Enterobacteriaceae. Again, overall composition was similar between these <lb/>two methods but showed some granularity in structure for pig caeca e.g. the <lb/>relative abundances of Escherichia were 34.3% and 50.9%, and for Klebsiella <lb/>10.6% and 4.9%, for Centrifuge and Kraken respectively. <lb/>Impact of sequencing depth on genus-level richess and taxonomic <lb/>profiles <lb/>Kraken and Centrifuge taxonomic profiles were highly stable to sequencing <lb/>depth within samples. Comparing different sequencing depths within samples <lb/>using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed that the relative taxonomic composition <lb/>was highly robust to sequencing depth, with 1 million reads per sample <lb/>already sufficient for &lt;1% dissimilarity to the composition inferred from 200 <lb/>million reads per sample (Supplementary Figure 1). This was true at both the <lb/>genus and species level, even though all classification methods are known to <lb/>have less precision and sensitivity at the species level (15,16).

			<body>the genus-level richness rapidly reached a plateau for all samples at ~1 <lb/>million reads per sample (Figure 6a and Figure 6b), suggesting a database <lb/>artifact (see &apos;Discussion&apos;). <lb/>Recovery of known genomic structures from cultured isolates using <lb/>metagenomes <lb/>In order to assess how well shotgun metagenomics could recapitulate culture-<lb/>dependent diversity, we cultured seven Enterobacteriaeceae isolates (four <lb/>from effluent, two from pig caeca, one from upstream sediment; Table 1), then <lb/>performed hybrid assembly (Supplementary Table 2). We then assembled <lb/>near-complete genomes and mapped metagenomic reads back to these <lb/>genomes (see Methods: &apos;Mapping of metagenomic sequences onto isolates&apos;; <lb/>Supplementary Table 3). 26/28 contigs from effluent isolates rapidly achieved <lb/>100% lateral coverage at 1X using metagenomic reads at 80-100 million <lb/>reads per sample (Figure 7a), with the two other contigs having almost-<lb/>complete coverage at 200 million reads (98.7% and 99.8% respectively). Pig <lb/>caeca isolates showed lower but fairly comprehensive lateral coverage of at <lb/>least 75% for chromosomes at 200 million reads (Figure 7b), but only one <lb/>contig (P1-5, shown in yellow) reached complete lateral coverage.

			<body>DISCUSSION <lb/>To our knowledge, our study is the first to have simultaneously investigated <lb/>effluent, animal caecal and environmental metagenomics with deep <lb/>sequencing of 200 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample (~60 <lb/>gigabases per sample). Previous studies have used from 10 million to 70 <lb/>million reads per sample (approximate bases per sample: 3Gb (17), 4 Gb (19), <lb/>7 Gb (6), 12 Gb (18)), often with shorter reads. We have demonstrated the <lb/>significant effect of sequencing depth on taxonomic and AMR gene content <lb/>profiling, and the ability to recover genomic content (obtained via single-<lb/>colony culture of isolates from the sample) from metagenomics. In brief, we <lb/>find that while accurately capturing broad-scale taxonomic composition <lb/>requires relatively low sequencing depth, this is emphatically not the case for <lb/>AMR gene diversity. This has critical importance for the many studies that <lb/>seek to characterise animal and environmental reservoirs of AMR, and for the <lb/>contextualisation of findings reported in previous metagenomics studies. <lb/>Deep metagenomic sequencing has been investigated more thoroughly in the <lb/>context of the human microbiome. Hillmann et al. (2018) recently reported <lb/>ultradeep metagenomics (2.5 billion reads) on two human stool samples, <lb/>concluding that as few as 0.5 million reads per sample could recover broad-<lb/>scale taxonomic changes and species profiles at &gt;0.05% relative abundance <lb/>(14). In line with this, we find that 1 million reads per sample is already <lb/>sufficient to accurately obtain taxonomic composition (at &lt;1% dissimilarity to <lb/>the &apos;true&apos; composition at 200 million reads). However, even 200 million reads <lb/>per sample is not enough to obtain the complete diversity of AMR genes in <lb/></body>

			<body>effluent. This is potentially concerning because environmental metagenomics <lb/>studies often use sequencing depths of as little as ~10 million reads per <lb/>sample (~3.6Gb). For pig caeca samples, 80 million reads per sample <lb/>appears to be adequate for sampling all AMR gene families represented in <lb/>CARD, but still not adequate for exhausting AMR allelic variants. Notably, we <lb/>adopted the stringent criterion of a perfect (i.e. 100%) match to assign any <lb/>given read to a reference AMR sequence. This strategy obviously reduces the <lb/>risk of false positives, while increasing false negatives. Therefore, our results <lb/>represent a conservative lower bound on the AMR diversity present in the <lb/>samples we analysed. <lb/>An additional challenge of metagenomics analysis in the context of AMR is <lb/>choosing a consistent strategy for &apos;counting&apos; AMR genes, whether in terms of <lb/>their presence or relative abundance, from mapped reads. It remains unclear <lb/>what the best approach is for this problem. One option is to count all the reads <lb/>which map to a reference gene; however, this means that reads are <lb/>potentially counted multiple times when the reference gene shares homology <lb/>with other genes in the database, or that counts may be underestimated if <lb/>reads are randomly assigned to best reference matches. In addition, reads <lb/>which map to a wildtype, non-resistant sequence may also be inadvertently <lb/>and inappropriately counted. Another option is to use only reads which map to <lb/>regions of a gene that are unique and not shared with other genes in the <lb/>database (e.g. as in ShortBRED (20)). This is a more conservative approach, <lb/>but may be inherently biased against closely-related genes in the database. <lb/>For example, CARD contains 14 sequences for bla NDM genes, which differ at <lb/></body>

			<body>less than 2% of their positions, so each gene individually has very few specific <lb/>regions. Exploiting knowledge of the often complex genetic variation within <lb/>AMR gene families is necessary to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding <lb/>presence/absence. Inferred abundances of particular AMR genes are likely <lb/>frequently contingent not only on mapping and counting strategies, but also <lb/>on the particular genetic features of the AMR genes catalogued in the chosen <lb/>reference database. Interpreting and comparing results across studies <lb/>utilising different methods therefore becomes difficult. <lb/>Once the type of count data to be considered (in terms of number of reads <lb/>mapping to a gene) has been chosen, a normalisation strategy is required to <lb/>compare across genes and samples. We found that normalising by gene <lb/>length changed the inferred abundance distributions of AMR genes across all <lb/>the sample types studied, again with important implications for those studies <lb/>that have not undertaken this kind of normalisation. We have also outlined a <lb/>protocol to obtain a pseudo-absolute gene copy number of specific regions of <lb/>AMR genes by normalising by both gene length and an exogenous spike of T. <lb/>thermophilus. While we do not claim that this accurately reflects the true <lb/>abundance of individual genes, we believe it is useful for comparisons across <lb/>samples within a study. In our study we took great care to ensure <lb/>standardised DNA extraction and had small batches of samples; probably as <lb/>a result, we obtained similar proportions of sequences of T. thermophilus for <lb/>all samples (range: 0.067-0.082%), but this may not always be the case. <lb/>Appropriate normalisation using exogenous DNA spikes to account for some <lb/></body>

			<body>of the extraction biases could have potentially dramatic effects on results and <lb/>their interpretation. <lb/>As well as examining normalised abundances, the lateral coverage of a gene <lb/>is also an important metric to decide whether a certain allele is likely present <lb/>in the sample. In effluent, the most abundant gene by specific read count was <lb/>&quot;Moraxella catarrhalis 23S rRNA with mutation conferring resistance to <lb/>macrolide antibiotics&quot;. However, the gene only had 29% lateral coverage, and <lb/>this result should therefore be interpreted cautiously. In fact, the high specific <lb/>read count is probably because CARD only includes one Moraxella rRNA <lb/>gene with an AMR mutation compared to twenty Escherichia rRNA genes; the <lb/>lateral coverage suggests that the AMR allele is not in fact present. This <lb/>underlines the importance of considering multiple metrics simultaneously. <lb/>Both taxonomic and AMR gene profiling outputs are clearly dependent on the <lb/>species and AMR databases used as references. It should be additionally <lb/>noted that for AMR gene profiling, some genes are variants of a wildtype <lb/>which may differ by as little as a single SNP. Because short-read <lb/>metagenomics typically surveys ‚â§150 bp fragments, even specific read counts <lb/>can in fact plausibly be wildtypes rather than particular resistance variants. <lb/>This can be overcome by adopting our stringent approach which requires an <lb/>exact match (i.e. at 100%) to call a given variant in the database; although <lb/>obviously this increases the rate of false negatives, we have shown that this <lb/>strategy appears successful given adequate sequencing depth. <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>We found a reasonable consistency between taxonomic classification <lb/>methods, but there were differences between Kraken and Centrifuge, and <lb/>undoubtedly there would have been differences with other methods, had we <lb/>tested them. This is a previously recognised issue (e.g. as in (21)) and has no <lb/>single solution; methods are optimised for different purposes and perform <lb/>differently depending on the combination of sample type, sequencing method, <lb/>and reference database used. As the field changes so rapidly and newer <lb/>methods become available, we strongly recommend that researchers with <lb/>shotgun metagenomic data review excellent benchmarking efforts such as <lb/>CAMI (21) and LEMMI (22) and assess the tools using a particular <lb/>quantitative metric rather than making a (perhaps arbitrary) choice for their <lb/>analysis. Investigating the robustness of conclusions to choice of method is <lb/>also a recommended step (23,24). <lb/>Remarkably, there were no &apos;unique genera&apos; at high sequencing depth: reads <lb/>assigned to all genera were present in all three sample types at high depth. <lb/>We believe this is an artifact due to the limited number of genomes available <lb/>in the species database used for the assignment methods. The RefSeq <lb/>database contains complete genomes for 11,443 strains, but these represent <lb/>only 1,065 genera. Our samples almost exhausted the entire genus space: <lb/>the number of genera that were classified by Centrifuge was 1,036, and this <lb/>number was the same for the effluent, pig caeca and upstream sediment <lb/>samples, i.e. all three samples had the same number of total unique genera <lb/>observed at 200 million reads depth. This was the same with Kraken, which <lb/>classified 1,035 genera in total and there was no difference in richness <lb/></body>

			<body>between the three samples. This highlights the importance of using diversity <lb/>measures which take into account the relative abundance of taxa rather than <lb/>just their presence or absence. <lb/>We also found that a large number of reads (&gt;50%) were unclassified by <lb/>either Kraken or Centrifuge. The absence of organisms such as fungi from our <lb/>reference database could have played a role in this, but other studies of <lb/>effluent have also found that between 42% and 68% of short metagenomic <lb/>reads cannot be assigned to any reference sequence (25-27). Our focus was <lb/>on using the best available tools to assess the bacterial composition of <lb/>samples; understanding what this unassigned microbial &apos;dark matter&apos; <lb/>represents was beyond the scope of this study, but would be valuable future <lb/>work. <lb/>Our analyses confirm that using culture-based methods offered <lb/>complementary and additional information to shotgun metagenomics. By <lb/>mapping metagenomic reads back to high-quality hybrid assemblies obtained <lb/>via culture, we found that the majority of isolates from effluent were <lb/>recoverable by metagenomics at sequencing depths. However, the majority of <lb/>isolates from pig caeca were not recovered. These results exemplify the need <lb/>for exploring both methods in analysing AMR genes and microbial <lb/>communities, as both show different perspectives on the AMR profiles and <lb/>strains present in a given sample. <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In summary, we have used a combination of deep metagenomic sequencing, <lb/>hybrid assembly of cultured isolates, and taxonomic and AMR gene profiling <lb/>methods to perform a detailed exploration of methodological approaches to <lb/>characterise animal and environmental metagenomic samples. Sequencing <lb/>depth critically affects the inferred AMR gene content and taxonomic diversity <lb/>of complex, polymicrobial samples, and even 200 million reads per sample <lb/>was insufficient to capture total AMR allelic diversity in effluent. Choice of <lb/>taxonomic profiler can result in significant differences in inferred species <lb/>composition. <lb/>The open-source software pipeline we have developed is freely available as <lb/>&apos;ResPipe&apos;. As well as packaging existing tools, ResPipe provides detailed <lb/>information on various metrics that are useful for assessing AMR gene <lb/>abundances, including: a novel normalisation technique for read counts, <lb/>specific mapping counts, and lateral coverage, all of which can provide <lb/>different but important insights. There is undoubtedly vast diversity present in <lb/>microbial communities. Establishing best practices and pipelines for analysing <lb/>this diversity with shotgun metagenomics is crucial to appropriately assess <lb/>AMR in environmental, animal and human faecal samples. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Sample types and settings <lb/>We sampled three distinct potential AMR reservoirs, namely: (i) pooled pig <lb/>caecal contents from 10 pigs from a breeder farm in Yorkshire and the <lb/></body>

			<body>Humber (denoted as &quot;pig caeca&quot;); (ii) river sediment 100m upstream of a <lb/>sewage treatment works (STW) at Cholsey STW, Cholsey, Oxfordshire <lb/>(&quot;upstream sediment&quot;); and (iii) treated sewage effluent emitted from Cholsey <lb/>STW (&quot;effluent&quot;). Cholsey STW is a plant that serves a population equivalent <lb/>of ~21,000 with a consented flow of 3200 m 3 /day; processes include primary <lb/>settlement tanks, followed by biological disc filters and humus tanks, and <lb/>subsequently disc filtration. These sample types were chosen to represent a <lb/>spectrum of predicted diversity of microbial communities (i.e. high to low: <lb/>effluent, pig caeca, upstream sediment). <lb/>The pooled pig caeca had been collected as part of a separate study <lb/>surveying the presence of AMR genes in E. coli in pigs from 56 farms across <lb/>the UK (28). In brief, caecal contents were sampled from 10 randomly <lb/>selected healthy finishing pigs from each of the farms at 12 different abattoirs <lb/>(March 2014 -October 2015), and suspended in 22.5 mL of PBS (processing <lb/>within 24hrs of collection). Aliquots of 100 ¬µL were frozen at -80 ¬∞C. This <lb/>study used an aliquot of pooled pig caeca selected randomly from this <lb/>collection. <lb/>For effluent and upstream sediment samples, sterile Whirl-pack TM bags were <lb/>attached to extendable sampling arms and placed into flow at the relevant site. <lb/>Samples in the bags were stirred with sterile spoons, and 5 mLs added to a <lb/>sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube. This process was repeated five times to create <lb/>a composite sample of approximately 25 mL. Samples were stored in a cool <lb/>box at 4 ¬∞C for transport and processed within 24 hrs. <lb/></body>

			<body>Metagenomic DNA extractions and Thermus spike-in <lb/>Metagenomic extractions on all samples were performed using the MoBio <lb/>PowerSoil¬Æ DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), as per the <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s protocol, and including a beadbeating step of two 40 second <lb/>cycles at 6 m/s in lysing matrix E. 12.5 ng of naked Thermus thermophilus <lb/>DNA (reference strain HB27, Collection number ATCC BAA-163, ordered <lb/>from DSMZ, Germany) was added to each sample in the PowerBead tube at <lb/>the start of the experiment, prior to the addition of Solution C1 of the DNA <lb/>Isolation Kit. The rationale for this was to enable subsequent normalisation to <lb/>the number of T. thermophilus genomes sequenced to adjust for varying <lb/>amounts of sample input, and extraction bias (33) (see &apos;Normalisation of gene <lb/>counts&apos;, below). <lb/>Metagenomic sequencing <lb/>Pooled libraries of all DNA extracts were sequenced across four lanes of an <lb/>Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, generating a median of 102,787,432 150 bp <lb/>paired-end reads (30.8 Gb) of data per extract. For the samples extracted in <lb/>replicate, we therefore had a median of 202,579,676 paired-end reads (60.7 <lb/>Gb) of data available for evaluation and sub-sampling analyses <lb/>(Supplementary Table 1). To confirm replicability of our extraction method on <lb/>the same sample, duplicate extractions of all three samples were performed. <lb/>To test replicability of sequencing, pooled libraries derived from extracts were <lb/>each sequenced across four sequencing lanes. The sequences were pooled <lb/>into each sample resulting in 202,579,676, 215,047,930 and 198,865,221 <lb/></body>

The <lb/>effluent and pig caeca samples were both randomly subsampled down to 200 <lb/>million reads per sample for downstream analysis. <lb/>Analysis of both AMR gene profiles and taxonomic profiles for the same <lb/>extract pooled across multiple sequencing lanes (HiSeq) were highly <lb/>reproducible, with little evidence of differences across lanes, although there <lb/>was a significant difference between replicates of AMR gene profiles from <lb/>pooled pig caeca (p=0.03), and replicates of taxonomic profiles for upstream <lb/>sediment (p=0.03) (Supplementary Table 4). <lb/>Sequencing depth subsampling and quality filtering <lb/>In order to simulate the effect of sequencing at different depths, each set of <lb/>pooled reads from the three samples was repeatedly subsampled (n=10) <lb/>using VSEARCH (fastx_subsampling, (34)) into the following set of depth <lb/>intervals: 1M, 2M, 4M, 6M, 7M, 8M, 9M, 10M, 20M, 40M, 60M, 80M, 100M, <lb/>120M, 140M, 160M and 180M. Low-quality portions of all reads were trimmed <lb/>using TrimGalore (v.0.4.4_dev, (35)). Specifically, we used a length cut-off of <lb/>75 bp and average Phred score ‚â•25, and the first 13 bp of Illumina standard <lb/>adapters (AGATCGGAAGAGC) for adapter trimming. <lb/>Taxonomic profiling <lb/>For profiling the abundance of bacterial species, the reads were classified <lb/>with Kraken (v.1.1, default settings; (16)) and Centrifuge (v.1.0.4, default <lb/>settings; (15)), which were chosen based on recency and reported frequency <lb/></body>

RefSeq sequences (v.91; (36)) at a &quot;Complete genome&quot; <lb/>assembly level for bacteria (11,443 strains), archaea (275 strains), viral (7,855 <lb/>strains) and human were downloaded from the NCBI repositories and used to <lb/>build two sets of indexed databases for both Kraken and Centrifuge using <lb/>respective scripts provided by each classifier. An &apos;in silico 16S&apos; marker-gene <lb/>based classification was performed by extracting 16S rRNA genes from the <lb/>reads using METAXA2 (4) followed by taxonomic assignment with the na√Øve <lb/>Bayesian RDP classifier (v2.10; (37)) with a minimum confidence of 0.5 <lb/>against the GreenGenes database (v.13.5; (38)). <lb/>To validate the taxonomic profiling component of our pipeline, we analyzed <lb/>ten previously simulated gut metagenomes (GI tract data from &quot;2nd CAMI Toy <lb/>Human <lb/>Microbiome <lb/>Project <lb/>Dataset&quot;, <lb/>https://openstack.cebitec.uni-<lb/>bielefeld.de:8080/swift/v1/CAMI_Gastrointestinal_tract) <lb/>produced <lb/>for <lb/>benchmarking as part of CAMI (21).

			<body>sequence of T. Thermophilus which was spiked into the samples. At the time <lb/>of writing, CARD contained 2,439 AMR sequences. As CARD is primarily <lb/>designed for genomic data, each sequence has an associated &apos;model&apos; of <lb/>detection i.e. criteria determining matches to the CARD reference sequences <lb/>for any given query sequence. The chief distinction is between genes that <lb/>have a &quot;protein homolog&quot; model, where detection is assessed using a <lb/>BLASTP cut-off to find functional homologs (n=2,238; e.g. NDM-1 beta-<lb/>lactamase), and those with a &quot;non protein homolog&quot; model, where detection is <lb/>assessed using other methods including the locations of specific SNPs <lb/>(n=247; e.g. M. tuberculosis gyrA conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones). <lb/>Although we use a mapping-based approach from shotgun metagenomic <lb/>reads, we have included this information in ResPipe. For simplicity, we <lb/>designate &quot;protein homolog&quot; model genes and &quot;non protein homolog&quot; model <lb/>genes under the broad headings &quot;resistance by presence&quot; and &quot;resistance by <lb/>variation&quot;, respectively (where &quot;variation&quot; can encompass SNPs, knockout, or <lb/>overexpression). The BAM files generated by the mapping were processed by <lb/>a custom script to generate a count table where only alignments with a strict <lb/>100% sequence identity (without allowing any deletions or insertions) to <lb/>CARD sequences were counted. Where a read mapped to more than one <lb/>AMR gene family or an AMR allelic variant (i.e. could not be designated into <lb/>any one AMR gene family or AMR allelic variant) it was counted as &quot;multiple <lb/>families&quot; or &quot;multiple alleles&quot; respectively. For each AMR allelic variant, we <lb/>calculated &quot;lateral coverage&quot;, defined as the proportion of the gene covered <lb/>by at least a single base of mapped reads. Where reads mapped to multiple <lb/>families or alleles, lateral coverage could not be calculated. <lb/></body>

			<body>Rarefaction curves <lb/>For fitting the relationship between sequencing depth per sample ùëë and the <lb/>richness ùëü of AMR gene families or allelic variants, we used the species <lb/>accumulation model defined by Clench (40): ùëü ùëë = <lb/>!√ó! <lb/>!!!√ó! . This model may be <lb/>flawed, but is only used here to give a rough estimate of the sequencing depth <lb/>required to achieve a proportion of ùëû (e.g. 95%) of the total richness, which is <lb/>then ùëë ! = <lb/>! <lb/>!√ó(!!!) . <lb/>Normalisation of gene counts <lb/>Assuming random sequencing, longer genes are more likely to be <lb/>represented in reads. In order to alleviate this gene length bias, the resulting <lb/>table was adjusted by multiplying each count by the average length of <lb/>mapped reads followed by dividing by the length of the AMR allelic variant to <lb/>which the reads were mapped. Where there were multiple alleles, average <lb/>length was used. In order to adjust for varying amounts of sample input and <lb/>extraction bias, the table was further normalised to the number of reads that <lb/>mapped to T. thermophilus using an adopted protocol from Satinsky et al. (33). <lb/>We added 12.5ng of Thermus thermophilus to each sample. This corresponds <lb/>to adding 6,025,538 copies of the T. thermophilus genome. The size of the T. <lb/>thermophilus genome is 1,921,946 bases, so the number of bases of T. <lb/>thermophilus added is ùëÅ !! <lb/>!&quot;&quot;#&quot; = 6,025,538 x 1,921,946. To obtain the number <lb/>of bases of T. thermophilus recovered by sequencing (ùëÅ !! <lb/>!&quot;#$%&quot;!&quot;&amp; ), we take the <lb/>number of reads assigned to T. thermophilus and multiply it by the insert size <lb/></body>

			<body>(300 bp). The read count ùëÅ ! for a particular subject g (e.g. a gene family or <lb/>allelic variant) can then be normalised as: <lb/>ùëÅ ! = ùëÅ ! √ó(ùëÅ !! <lb/>!&quot;&quot;#&quot; √∑ ùëÅ !! <lb/>!&quot;#$%&quot;!&quot;&amp; ) <lb/>These normalisation protocols are intended to produce a pseudo-absolute <lb/>gene copy number of each AMR gene family and AMR allelic variant, while <lb/>recognising that this remains an estimated of the actual copy number of <lb/>genes present in any given sample. <lb/>Isolate culture and DNA extraction <lb/>For effluent samples, the effluent filter was mixed with 20 mL of nutrient broth <lb/>and shaken for 10 mins at 120 rpm. 100 ¬µL of neat sample, and 10 -1 and 10 -2 <lb/>dilutions (in nutrient broth) were plated onto a CHROMagar Orientation agar <lb/>supplemented with a 10 ¬µg cefpodoxime disc placed on one half of the agar <lb/>plate. For pig caeca and upstream sediment samples, aliquots of 100 ¬µL of <lb/>sample at neat, 10 -1 , 10 -2 , and 10 -3 -fold dilutions were plated onto a <lb/>CHROMagar Orientation agar supplemented supplemented with a 10 ¬µg <lb/>cefpodoxime disc placed on one half of the agar plate. Serial dilutions were <lb/>plated to enable morphological identification and isolation of individual <lb/>colonies. All plates were incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 18 hours. We used <lb/>cefpodoxime resistance as a surrogate marker for the selective culture of <lb/>more drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (29,30). <lb/>Up to four individual colonies from each sample with a typical appearance for <lb/>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. or Citrobacter spp., and <lb/>from either within or external to the cefpdoxime zone, were subcultured on <lb/></body>

Following <lb/>sub-culture, species was confirmed by MALDI-ToF (Bruker), and stored in <lb/>nutrient broth + 10% glycerol at -80 ¬∞C prior to repeat sub-culture for DNA <lb/>extraction. <lb/>DNA was extracted from pure sub-cultures using the Qiagen Genomic <lb/>tip/100G (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), according to the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>instructions. Extracts from seven isolates (four from effluent, two from pig <lb/>caeca, and one from upstream sediment) were selected for combination long-<lb/>read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read sequencing, based on sufficient <lb/>DNA yield (with a requirement at the time of the study for ~5¬µg DNA for library <lb/>preparation), and appropriate fragment size distributions (assessed using <lb/>TapeStation 4200, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA).
