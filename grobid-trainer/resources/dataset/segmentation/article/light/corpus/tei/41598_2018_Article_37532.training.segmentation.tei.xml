J. smits &amp; Lutz schmitt <lb/>Lantibiotics are a growing class of natural compounds, which possess antimicrobial activity against <lb/>a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria. their high potency against human pathogenic strains such <lb/>as MRsA and VRe makes them excellent candidates as substitutes for classic antibiotics in times of <lb/>increasing multidrug resistance of bacterial strains. New lantibiotics are detected in genomes and <lb/>can be heterologously expressed. the functionality of these novel lantibiotics requires a systematic <lb/>purification and characterization to benchmark them against for example the well-known lantibiotic <lb/>nisin. Here, we used a standardized workflow to characterize lantibiotics consisting of six individual <lb/>steps. the expression and secretion of the lantibiotic was performed employing the promiscuous nisin <lb/>modification machinery. We mutated the first amino acid of nisin into all proteinaceous amino acids <lb/>and compared their bactericidal potency against sensitive strains as well as strains expressing nisin <lb/>resistance proteins. Interestingly, we can highlight four distinct groups based on the residual activity of <lb/>nisin against sensitive as well as resistant L. lactis strains. <lb/></front>

			<body>Since the last decade the exponential increase of the number of antibiotic resistant strains steadily alarms the <lb/>world health organization, which is reflected in their annually reports regarding the surveillance of antimicrobial <lb/>and antibiotic resistance (WHO, GLASS report 2016-2017). Therefore, the urgent need for antimicrobial com-<lb/>pounds, which can be used as alternatives to the classic antibiotic treatment, has dramatically increased. Some <lb/>classes of antibiotic such as cephalosporins, macrolides, carbapenems or penicillin derivatives are vital for human <lb/>medicine and the treatment of microbial infections. However, observed resistance to important antibiotic classes <lb/>makes it necessary to explore new classes of natural or synthetic antimicrobial compounds 1 . <lb/>One possible class are antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Within this class especially lanthipeptides possessing <lb/>antimicrobial activity, which are called lantibiotics (lanthionine containing antibiotics), are considered as possible <lb/>lead compounds 2 . Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized as a precursor peptide (LanA), between 30-60 amino <lb/>acids in size and undergo specific post-translational modifications (PTM) 3,4 . They are furthermore dissected into <lb/>an N-terminal leader peptide and a C-terminal core peptide, in which the PTMs are installed by specialized <lb/>modification enzymes. Upon leader peptide cleavage, the lantibiotic becomes activated and exhibits antimicro-<lb/>bial activity with efficiencies in the low nanomolar to millimolar range. Lantibiotics like NAI-107 or NVB302 <lb/>are already subjected to pre-clinical trails and might be good candidates in the treatment of multidrug-resistant <lb/>strains like MRSA or similar Gram-positive strains 5-7 . <lb/>Up to now &gt;50 different lantibiotics with a similar set of PTMs have been described (for more details see <lb/>review 8 ). One specific PTM within the core peptide of lantibiotics is the dehydration of serine and threonine <lb/>residues resulting in the formation of dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues. This reaction is catalysed by <lb/>a specific dehydratase called LanB (dehydratase of class I lantibiotics) 9 . The hallmark of lantibiotics is the second <lb/>modification, which leads to the formation of lanthionine (Lan) and/or methyl-lanthionine (MeLan) rings. The <lb/>reaction proceeds via a Michael-type condensation of the dehydrated serine or threonine residues with the thiol <lb/>group of a cysteine residue, which is introduced regio-and stereospecifically by the cyclase LanC (cylcase of class <lb/>I lantibiotics) 10 . This ring formation results in a thioether bond giving rise to high thermostability and more <lb/>profound resistance against proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity strictly depends on the <lb/>presence of the Lan/MeLan rings 11 . <lb/></body>

			<body>In general, lantibiotics exercise their antimicrobial activity through different modes of action. One prominent <lb/>mode is the binding to the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II molecules concomitant with the inhibition of pepti-<lb/>doglycan biosynthesis 12 . Another mode of action is the perturbation of bacterial cell membranes. Nisin or subtilin <lb/>build a pore-forming complex with its receptor lipid II thereby sequestering lipid II within the membrane 13,14 <lb/>(for a review about lipid II binding peptides see 11 ). In the case of nisin, which is active in the low nM range, this <lb/>process occurs on the ms time scale 15,16 . Some lantibiotics such as for example Pep5 however, directly penetrate <lb/>the target membrane 17 . <lb/>In comparison to other cationic AMPs, cytotoxicity against human cells is rarely observed, since lipid II, the <lb/>main target of lantibiotics, is absent in eukaryotic membranes (except the two-peptide lantibiotic cytolysin S/L 18 ). <lb/>Thus, the efficient activity and the low cytotoxicity combined with few examples of known inherent resistances <lb/>(see 19-21 ) constitute these peptides as excellent lead structures for new antibiotics. <lb/>Nevertheless, the bottleneck of lantibiotic research is the identification and characterization of these com-<lb/>pounds. With respect to the first, lantibiotics can be detected in genome sequences by data-mining approaches <lb/>using bioinformatic tools such as BAGEL4 22 , antiSMASH 23 , RiPPquest 24 and RiPPMiner 25 . Such tools either <lb/>detect open reading frames encoding lantibiotics within a genome based on neighbouring PTM-enzymes or <lb/>combine specific sequences of PTM-enzymes and the cleavage motifs within the leader peptides. <lb/>However, every newly identified lantibiotic requires a detailed experimental characterization with respect to <lb/>its antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the isolation of a native sample or heterologously expressed samples in <lb/>Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) 26,27 or Gram-positive bacteria (L. lactis or B. subtilis) 28-30 is a prerequisite. Several <lb/>reports indicate that the nisin modification and secretion system can be employed to modify and secrete other <lb/>lantibiotics. Apparently, the nisin PTM system provides sufficient promiscuity to produce for example bagelicin <lb/>from Streptococcus suis R61, flavucin from Corynebacterium lipophiloflavum and others peptides, if their core <lb/>peptide is fused to the nisin leader peptide 29,31,32 . Nisin, produced by the Gram-positive Lactococcus lactis (L. <lb/>lactis) bacterium and modified by the nisin PTM machinery is one, if not the best characterized lantibiotic and <lb/>may therefore be used as a standardized lantibiotic for benchmarking. <lb/>Since the number of novel lanthipeptides/lantibiotics increases due to genome mining, design of <lb/>hybrid-peptides (by coupling different lanthipeptides to a certain leader peptide), simple mutations or even <lb/>chemical synthesis, a general pipeline to characterize the potential antimicrobial activity and thereby potency of a <lb/>lantibiotic is urgently required to ensure appropriate benchmarking of such lantibiotics 1,33,34 . <lb/>Here, we used a standardized workflow for the characterization of lantibiotics, containing up to six steps <lb/>depending on the availability of the lantibiotic (Fig. 1a). We exchanged the isoleucine at position one (I 1 ) of nisin <lb/>to all other 20 natural occurring amino acids (aa) (Fig. 1b) and determined the impact on the expression, modifi-<lb/>cation and antimicrobial properties of these nisin variants and benchmarked it against wild type nisin. <lb/>Results <lb/>General characterisation of nisin I1 mutants. The nisin A core peptide was a target of many former <lb/>studies aiming to alter the antimicrobial activity of nisin or to broaden its spectrum against microbial targets. <lb/>Position 1 in the nisin core peptide received our attention since some mutations were described that lacked in our <lb/>opinion a complete and quantitative characterization. For example, the substitutions of tryptophan-analogues 35 <lb/>as well as the mutants I 1 W, I 1 K, I 1 D 36 , I 1 G and I 1 Q (described in 37 ). Accordingly, we characterized all mutants at I 1 <lb/>of nisin A using our standardized protocol, which is based on six individual steps (Fig. 1a; I-VI). <lb/>The first steps (I-III) concerning expression, secretion and purification of the nisin variants gave no major <lb/>variation compared to wild type nisin, which were all expressed as a leader-containing variant (pre-nisin). The <lb/>yield of pre-nisin was 6.0 Â± 0.3 mg/ L culture supernatant (Supplementary Fig. S1) with a purity &gt;95% based on <lb/>Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S2). The yield of most I 1 mutants decreased to 40-60% of wild type nisin <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. S1). The mutants I 1 C and I 1 W had an even lower yield of approximately 35%. This lower <lb/>yield however did not affect our purification protocol and all pre-nisin variants were purified using the same <lb/>protocol and resulted in comparable purity (Supplementary Fig. S2) 29,32 . <lb/>Step IV concerns leader peptide cleavage and thereby activation of the purified pre-nisin variants. Here, we <lb/>used the secreted variant of the natural leader peptidase NisP, by which the leader peptide is cleaved in vitro and <lb/>the cleavage efficiency (%) can be calculated as recently shown 38 . We used an RP-HPLC set-up to monitor prod-<lb/>uct formation, in which the appearance of the leader peptide in the chromatograms was used to determine the <lb/>concentration of activated nisin (Supplementary Fig. S3). Pre-nisin (Supplementary Fig. S3) had a retention time <lb/>(RT) between 19 to 21 min, whereas the leader peptide eluted as two peaks corresponding to the variants with and <lb/>without the N-terminal methionine between 14 to 16 min, respectively. The nisin core peptide eluted at a later <lb/>retention time of approximately 23 min (Supplementary Fig. S3). In some cases, the nisin I 1 mutants resulted in <lb/>separated peaks of pre-peptide and core peptide after the activation by NisP (compare mutants I 1 M, I 1 L, I 1 V, I 1 W, <lb/>I 1 Y, I 1 F and I 1 C in Supplementary Fig. S4). However, in the case of the I 1 mutants I 1 A, I 1 G, I 1 T, I 1 S, I 1 K, I 1 R, I 1 H, <lb/>I 1 Q, I 1 E, I 1 N and I 1 D) the formation of a core peptide peak in terms of a new and separated peak in the chroma-<lb/>togram was not observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Rather, the peaks with a retention time between 18-21 min <lb/>contained both species, the cleaved and non-cleaved lantibiotic, and can therefore not be deconvoluted for proper <lb/>determination of the amount of activated nisin. Hence, only the two peaks of the leader peptide were used and the <lb/>area was integrated for the determination of the concentration of activated nisin and its I 1 mutants. The concen-<lb/>tration was calculated based on a standard calibration curve (Supplementary Fig. S5), where we precisely deter-<lb/>mined the concentration of the activated nisin or I 1 mutants. We used this concentration determination instead <lb/>of the colorimetric protein concentration determination as for example Bradford or the BCA-assay since the <lb/>latter two assays cannot differentiate between the activated and non-activated form of the secreted variants. Since <lb/>nisin is not active unless the leader is cleaved off, the determination of the area of the leader peak to calculate the <lb/></body>

			<body>amount of the activated lantibiotic directly relates to the antimicrobial activity without need to further purify the <lb/>peptide after cleavage. <lb/>All I 1 mutations were subjected to NisP cleavage and most of the variants were cleaved, but a strong influence <lb/>of the nature of the I 1 substitutions with respect to cleavage efficiency was observed (Supplementary Fig. S6). <lb/>The cleavage efficiency for wild type pre-nisin A was 94.3 Â± 1.7% but lower for the mutants I 1 M, I 1 L, I 1 A and <lb/>I 1 V (72.3 Â± 1.4%, 72.4 Â± 1.3%, 81.0 Â± 1.8% and 58.1Â± 2.8%, respectively). All other variants displayed efficiency <lb/>below 50% (Supplementary Fig. S6). This holds especially in those cases, where the amino acid at position one was <lb/>exchanged to a charged amino acid (e.g. I 1 K 9.2 Â± 1.3%; I 1 E 9.5 Â± 0.7%) or contained a bulky hydrophobic side <lb/>chain (e.g. I 1 F 12.9 Â± 0.8%; I 1 W 5.7 Â± 0.2%; I 1 Y 22.6 Â± 2.3%) (Supplementary Fig. S6). To highlight two examples, <lb/>NisP was only able to cleave 5.7 Â± 0.2% of the I 1 W variant, which was significantly lower as the cleavage efficiency <lb/>previously reported 35,39 . Interestingly, the I 1 P mutant was not cleaved at all by NisP (Supplementary Figs S4 and <lb/>S6). Even after an extensive prolongation of the incubation time, no leader peptide peak was detected in the <lb/>RP-HPLC chromatogram (Supplementary Fig. S4). It is important to stress in this context that the cleavage effi-<lb/>ciencies cannot be determined from Tricine-SDS gels (20%). Here, the leader peptide as well as the core peptide <lb/>would co-migrate, which obviously will falsify the staining results. <lb/>As previously reported 37,38 , a prerequisite for high cleavage efficiency by NisP is the presence of at least one <lb/>(methyl-)lanthionine ring. Therefore, we wondered whether some of the nisin variants with low cleavage efficien-<lb/>cies were altered in their modification status (step V). To detect possible ring formation(s) we incubated the lan-<lb/>tibiotic prior to MS analysis with the thiol-reactive agent 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate <lb/>(CDAP), which binds to free cysteines and results in a mass shift of 25 Da per covalently attached CDAP. When no <lb/>mass shift occurs, all cysteine residues are part of thioether rings, while for every mass shift of 25 Da one cysteine is <lb/>not part of a (Me)Lan thioether ring. As controls, we also used the unmodified version of pre-nisin (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. S7a), in which no rings are present and five CDAP adducts were identified indicating that five cysteine side <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>chains were available for a simultaneous labelling reaction and the fully modified pre-nisin, showing no coupling <lb/>products (Supplementary Fig. S7b). This highlights the quantitative nature of the CDAP assay 31 . <lb/>For most analysed I 1 mutants no CDAP attachment was observed (Supplementary Figs S8, S9, S10 and <lb/>Supplementary Table S1). Exceptions of this observation are the mutants I 1 L, I 1 A, I 1 V, I 1 G, I 1 F, I 1 Y, I 1 R, I 1 H, I 1 Q, <lb/>I 1 N, where small amounts of coupling products were observed with variations from 7x dehydrations (dh) to 5x <lb/>dh with one coupling product (Supplementary Figs S8, S9, S10 and Table S1). These amounts are very small, in <lb/>comparison to the main species and the MS analysis showed clearly, that the I 1 mutants primary containing all <lb/>lanthionine rings. In the case of nisin I 1 C, where one additional cysteine residue was introduced also one cou-<lb/>pling product was observed (Supplementary Fig. S9) In summary, although the analysis of the cleavage reaction <lb/>revealed I 1 mutants with lower cleavage efficiency, the modifications of the core peptide within these variants <lb/>were not altered. <lb/>Impact of mutations at position I 1 on antimicrobial activity of nisin. Growth inhibition assays <lb/>(step VI) were used to determine the potency of the activated I 1 mutants. First, this assay was performed against <lb/>the sensitive strain NZ9000-Cm harbouring an empty plasmid pIL-SV (the strain NZ9000-Erm gave identical <lb/>results) to determine the value, at which 50% of the cells were inhibited in growth (IC 50 value). <lb/>The nisin A wild type (WT) had an IC 50 value of 4.8 Â± 0.7 nM, which is in a similar range as previous reported <lb/>values determined with strains NZ9000-Cm/NZ9000-Erm 40-42 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2). The I 1 P <lb/>mutant was used in very high concentrations (&gt;1 mM) in the growth inhibition assay but displayed no antimi-<lb/>crobial activity (Fig. 2; IC 50 value is marked with a star symbol). This indicated that this variant was not activated <lb/>by NisP, in line with our observations described above. <lb/>All other variants were used and displayed IC 50 values ranging from wild type level to 100 nM or even to lower <lb/>ÂµM values. Based on the measured activities, the variants can be grouped into four classes depending on the <lb/>amino acid property. <lb/>The first group contains mainly aliphatic amino acids (except M)(Fig. 2, green bars and Supplementary <lb/>Table S2). The mutation to methionine gave similar IC 50 values to WT (5.8 Â± 0.3 nM), but the exchange to the <lb/>amino acids leucine, alanine and valine lead to a two-fold decrease in activity (9.8 Â± 0.5 nM, 10.7 Â± 0.4 nM and <lb/>11.8 Â± 0.9 nM, respectively). The mutation to glycine lead to an even further decrease in activity and the IC 50 value <lb/>was determined to 143.0 Â± 5.1 nM. <lb/>The second group (Fig. 2, yellow bars and Supplementary Table S2) contained aromatic amino acids (except <lb/>histidine, which belongs to the fourth group) and displayed a high antimicrobial activity against the sensitive <lb/>strain. Especially, the mutants I 1 W and I 1 F displayed lower IC 50 values (2.5 Â± 0.2 nM and 3.7 Â± 0.8 nM) than WT, <lb/>indicating an increased antimicrobial activity. The mutant I 1 Y showed a lower activity and displayed an IC 50 value <lb/>of 10.6 Â± 0.9 nM. <lb/>The third group (Fig. 2, magenta bars and Supplementary Table S2) displayed IC 50 values ranging from 8.6 to <lb/>112 nM. The mutation I 1 C lead to antimicrobial activity of WT (below 10 nM) with an IC 50 value of 8.6 Â± 0.5 nM, <lb/>whereas the mutation to I 1 T or I 1 S displayed a considerable reduction of the antimicrobial activity with IC 50 <lb/>values of 37.3 Â± 1.6 nM and 112.4 Â± 5.0 nM, respectively. Interestingly, these substitutions are all amino acids, <lb/>which are potential targets of the PTM machinery. Since the mutation I 1 C introduced an additional cysteine <lb/>residue, we carefully analysed for the presence of an additional (Me)Lan ring. However, the coupling assay clearly <lb/>Figure 2. Growth inhibition assay of strain NZ9000-Cm in the presence of nisin and the corresponding I 1 <lb/>variants. The lantibiotic nisin A (WT) and its I 1 mutants were used for growth inhibition (IC 50 ) against strain <lb/>NZ9000-Cm. IC 50 values were grouped in four different sub-groups (group 1: aa M-G, green; group 2: aa <lb/>W-Y, yellow; group 3: aa C-S, magenta; group 4: aa K-D, orange), Values represents the average of at least five <lb/>independent measurements and the errors report the standard deviation of the mean (SDM).

			<body>demonstrated the presence of one accessible cysteine suggesting that this nisin variant still harbours five (Me) <lb/>Lan rings (Supplementary Fig. S9). Unfortunately, this assay cannot determine which ring(s) are formed. Since <lb/>the IC 50 value is not altered, we propose that this mutant follows normal ring formation and the additional intro-<lb/>duced cysteine at position one was labelled with CDAP. <lb/>The mutations I 1 T and I 1 S, containing an additional dehydration position. Based on our MS analysis, we saw <lb/>mainly no additional dehydration, which leads to the conclusion that this position is not well recognized by NisB <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. S9). But we clearly observed that the possible higher number of dehydrations of the peptide <lb/>at the N-terminus of the core peptide decreased antimicrobial activity (IC 50 values &gt; 30 nM). Here, mutation to <lb/>the polar residue serine had a larger impact on the antimicrobial activity of the core peptide compared to the <lb/>threonine substitution. <lb/>The fourth group (Fig. 2, orange bars and Supplementary Table S2) contained charged amino acids and the <lb/>amide side chains of glutamate and aspartate. In general, a strong negative effect on the antimicrobial activity <lb/>was observed within this group. The IC 50 values were higher compared to the other groups and ranged from <lb/>44 nM to 3746 nM. The substitutions at position 1 to the amino acids lysine, arginine or histidine lead to 10-fold <lb/>or even 20-fold higher IC 50 values (I 1 K: 44.7 Â± 3.0 nM, I 1 R: 113.9 Â± 13.6 nM and I 1 H: 140.0 Â± 5.0 nM) compared <lb/>to the WT IC 50 value. A major alteration in antimicrobial activity was observed in the case of an exchange I 1 Q <lb/>and I 1 E, respectively. Here, the IC 50 values were 592.0 Â± 17.8 nM for I 1 Q and 1328.0 Â± 32.7 nM for I 1 E. An even <lb/>more dramatic effect was observed upon introduction of I 1 N or I 1 D. Here, IC 50 values of 1386.0 Â± 46.3 nM and <lb/>3746.0 Â± 144.1 nM were determined. These variants displayed such high IC 50 values (marked by two star symbols <lb/>(**)) that these mutations were not analysed in further growth inhibition assays using resistant strains. <lb/>In summary, the antimicrobial activity of the different I 1 mutants towards the sensitive strain NZ9000-Cm <lb/>correlated with the physico-chemical properties of amino acid at position one. Although this substitution was <lb/>only one amino acid and the modification state of the core peptide was not altered, the active lantibiotics showed <lb/>drastic variations in antimicrobial activities. Based on the growth inhibition assay, these I 1 mutants were divided <lb/>into four groups, where aromatic amino acids at position one lead to higher activity but an introduction of polar, <lb/>charged amino acids or its amidated counterparts decreased the potency of the corresponding variant to the <lb/>sensitive strain. <lb/>The influence of I 1 mutants on immunity and resistance proteins. Lantibiotics are regarded as <lb/>potential antibiotic candidates, which might have the potential to replace classic antibiotics and thereby overcome <lb/>the increasing resistances against major antibiotic classes. One potential drawback of lantibiotics is highlighted by <lb/>the few reported resistance mechanisms against for example nisin 43 . Therefore, it is critical, to screen for strains, <lb/>which might be resistant against the new lantibiotic, if a new lantibiotic is characterized and its potency is deter-<lb/>mined. In our protocol, we implemented first the screen against a sensitive strain (see above), but more impor-<lb/>tantly we included four strains expressing immunity or resistance proteins against nisin. The immunity proteins <lb/>NisI (lipoprotein) and NisFEG (ABC transporter) from L. lactis are the first and second line of defence of the nisin <lb/>producer strain 44 . Upon expression in the sensitive strain NZ9000, these proteins might provide immunity and <lb/>one can study the activity of the lantibiotic in the presence of immunity proteins. Additionally, we screened the <lb/>effect of the I 1 variants on the nisin resistance proteins SaNSR (lipoprotein) and SaNsrFP (ABC transporter) to <lb/>fully consider the potency of the newly lantibiotic/lantibiotic variant. If these proteins are expressed in the sensi-<lb/>tive strain, they confer resistance against the nisin and likely to nisin variants. <lb/>The nisin variants were analysed according to the above provided classification of four groups. The first group of <lb/>I 1 mutants showed a similar tendency in activity towards the strains for immunity and resistance as for the sensitive <lb/>strain (Supplementary Table S2). The substitutions of isoleucine to methionine, leucine, valine and alanine gave <lb/>IC 50 values for strain NZ9000-NisI in a range of 35-65 nM and were comparable to nisin A WT (46.0 Â± 6.0 nM) <lb/>(Fig. 3a). Only the substitution to glycine gave a higher value of 785.7 Â± 9.7 nM reflecting the low activity of this <lb/>variant. The IC 50 values of the first group for the strain NZ9000-NisFEG were also in the range of 34-50 nM (nisin <lb/>A WT: 53.0 Â± 4.5 nM). Again, a higher IC 50 value of 557.8 Â± 28.3 nM was determined for the I 1 G mutant. <lb/>When analysing the results of the resistance strains two major changes were observed. In general, the IC 50 <lb/>values of the I 1 mutants for strain NZ9000-SaNSR were similar (53-84 nM) to the WT (73.1 Â± 3.6 nM). The IC 50 <lb/>value for the I 1 G mutant was 278.5 Â± 13.3 nM and lower in comparison to the IC 50 values of the other strains <lb/>(Fig. 3a). The IC 50 values for strain NZ9000-SaNsrFP changed only for the mutants I 1 A (166.1 Â± 5.1 nM) and I 1 G <lb/>(2257.0 Â± 53.4 nM), respectively, reflecting the lower activity of these variants towards the strain. <lb/>The second group of I 1 mutants included the aromatic amino acids, for which a higher activity against the <lb/>immunity and resistance strains was observed (Supplementary Table S2). The higher activity was determined for <lb/>all strains (I 1 W &gt; I 1 F &gt; wild type &gt; I 1 Y). The exception is the mutant I 1 Y and strain NZ9000-NisFEG. Here, the <lb/>IC 50 value was lower than the one of nisin A WT (53.0 Â± 4.5 nM) (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the mutant I 1 W showed <lb/>high potency for the strains NZ9000-NisI, NZ9000-NisFEG and NZ9000-SaNSR with IC 50 values below 25 nM. <lb/>A higher IC 50 value of 46.6 Â± 1.1 nM was only determined against strain NZ9000-SaNsrFP (Fig. 3b). <lb/>The third group of I 1 mutants showed opposing results concerning immunity and resistance (Supplementary <lb/>Table S2). Here, mutants I 1 T and I 1 S had lower antimicrobial activity than wild type reflected by IC 50 value <lb/>even above 100 nM (Fig. 3c). Especially, the more than five-fold lower activity against strains NZ9000-NisI <lb/>and NZ9000-SaNsrFP is surprising as the IC 50 values were determined to be above 500 nM. For the mutant I 1 T <lb/>the values are 653.3 Â± 5.1 nM and 716.1 Â± 28.6 nM, whereas for the mutant I 1 S the values are two-fold higher <lb/>(1898.0 Â± 62.3 nM and 2893.0 Â± 34.8 nM) (Fig. 3c). The exception is the mutant I 1 C, which showed a similar activ-<lb/>ity towards the strains as nisin A WT with IC 50 value in the range of 41 to 101 nM. Based on the MS analysis only <lb/>one free cysteine was present, we cannot conclude which of the cysteines is not part of a thioether bridge. As this <lb/>variant showed a similar antimicrobial activity, we however suggest no alteration in ring pattern (Supplementary <lb/>Fig. S9). <lb/></body>

			<body>In the last group of I 1 mutants, all variants showed lower antimicrobial activity towards the strains of immu-<lb/>nity and resistance (Supplementary Table S2). The IC 50 values were above 400 nM (Fig. 3d) except for mutants I 1 R <lb/>and I 1 K, which had IC 50 values of 186.4 Â± 3.1 and 301.2 Â± 4.7 nM, respectively, against strain NZ9000-NisFEG. <lb/>Similar to this, mutants I 1 R, I 1 K and I 1 H showed a higher antimicrobial activity against strain NZ9000-SaNSR <lb/>(Fig. 3d). <lb/>In summary, I 1 mutations clearly influenced the efficiency of the immunity and resistance proteins. The IC 50 <lb/>values of the sensitive strain and resistance strains for the different I 1 mutations can be used to calculate a fold of <lb/>resistance (Fig. 4). Here, the effect of certain mutations is even less pronounced (e.g. I 1 S or I 1 T on NZ9000-NisI) <lb/>but still show the reduced activity. The reasons for this reduction might be that these variants are better ligand <lb/>and/or substrates for the immunity and resistance proteins. Another explanation might be, that the variants have <lb/>an altered interaction with the membrane (I 1 K; I 1 R, I 1 W, I 1 F). The same is true for the opposite case, in which the <lb/>mutants are more active. Here, the mutants are either worse substrates or showed a loss in membrane attraction <lb/>due to charge repulsion (I 1 E/D mutants) or reduced hydrophobicity (I 1 G mutant). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The increased detection of antibiotic resistances of human pathogenic strains urgently calls for the identifica-<lb/>tion of novel lead structures, which can be used to develop long lasting antibiotics. One promising family of <lb/>candidates are the antimicrobial peptide subfamily of lantibiotics. They are small ribosomally synthesized and <lb/>post-translational modified peptides 45,46 , which possess a potent antimicrobial activity generally in the nM range. <lb/>Their antimicrobial activity makes them excellent candidates to treat MDR-strains such as MRSA or VRE 47 . <lb/>Recently, numerous new lantibiotics were discovered by &quot;in silico genome mining&quot; approaches, using availa-<lb/>ble bacterial genome sequence data 48 . Here, BAGEL4 and its predecessor BAGEL3 are powerful algorisms to <lb/>detect lantibiotics sequences within bacterial genome sequences 22 . Novel lantibiotic such as flavucin, bagelicin <lb/>and agalacticin were found and their antimicrobial properties were determined 29 . In the study by Heel et al. 2016 <lb/>the potency of many new lantibiotics were screen against a set of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains to <lb/>show their antimicrobial potencies. Till now, however, it is not possible to deduce the potency solely on sequence <lb/>information and every lantibiotic needs to be expressed and purified for subsequent characterization of its anti-<lb/>microbial activity. To ensure comparability of the determined activities and the potencies derived from these <lb/>experiments a standardized protocol needs to be established, which allows benchmarking novel against already <lb/>characterized lantibiotics (e.g. nisin). This should also include mutations designed or natural variants of previ-<lb/>ously characterized lantibiotics. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>In this study, we used a standardized protocol based on six individual steps (I-VI). Some of these steps have <lb/>been previously (partly) published, but not as a combined robust protocol 29,32,40,42,49 . By replacing I 1 of nisin A <lb/>against any other amino acid, the complete influence of the exchange on expression, purification and/or activity <lb/>was monitored to provide a quantitative characterisation. <lb/>The characterisation of a novel lantibiotic starts with the expression system and the choice of homologous or <lb/>heterologous expression. Homologous expression of a lantibiotic is often associated with its isolation from super-<lb/>natants of lantibiotic producer strains (examples are epidermin 50 , mutacin 1140 51 , NAI-107 and related lantibiot-<lb/>ics 52 or pinensins 53 ). The yield of this strategy can be limited, especially if the producer is hardly cultivable under <lb/>lab conditions or induction of the lantibiotic is not trigged (e.g. geobacillin I 54 , salivaricin 9 55 and staphylococcin <lb/>Au-26, 56 ). <lb/>Therefore, for some lantibiotics such as lichenicidin from Bacillus licheniformis ATCCC 14580 26 , or prochlo-<lb/>rosins from Prochlorococcus MIT 9313 57 a heterologous expression in E. coli is the preferential strategy to obtain <lb/>higher yields of the pre-lantibiotic. Alternatively, the expression via the NICE-system in L. lactis 58 is a possibility. <lb/>Here, the pre-lantibiotic is modified after induction with the lantibiotic nisin by the PTM system (NisB/NisC) and <lb/>secreted by the ABC transporter NisT 32 . <lb/>The nisin PTM system was shown to be of sufficient promiscuity to modify and secrete lantibiotics as well as <lb/>non-lantibiotic peptides 29,32 . As an advantage any lantibiotic can be produced as a pre-lantibiotic. This results in <lb/>higher yields, as the lantibiotic is not antimicrobial active and is not limiting the growth of the producer strain. <lb/>Furthermore, the pre-lantibiotic (as pre-nisin) shows higher pH stability in contrast to nisin (low solubility at <lb/>pH &gt; 7) 59 . Normally, we observed yields for the pre-nisin and its variants of 3-6 mg per liter cell culture super-<lb/>natant after purification (Supplementary Fig. S1). Considering these yields further down-streaming steps are <lb/>employed to characterize the lantibiotic. <lb/>Although NisB and NisC are promiscuous in modifying their substrate, it is crucial that both enzymes fully <lb/>modify the core peptide similar to pre-nisin. Otherwise, the steps III (cleavage by NisP) and VI (antimicrobial <lb/>assay) might be less informative. Thus, even new mutants of nisin, like mutants in the hinge region 60,61 or in the <lb/>leader peptide 37 , required a full characterisation with respect to their modification and antimicrobial activity. <lb/>The purified pre-lantibiotics need to be analysed by RP-HPLC before and after activation by proteolytic cleav-<lb/>age of the leader peptide. In this study, we activated pre-nisin and the I 1 mutants in vitro by purified leader <lb/>peptidase NisP (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4; described in 38,49 ). The cleavage efficiency and also the exact con-<lb/>centration of the active lantibiotic were determined via RP-HPLC (Supplementary Fig. S6). Hence, every acti-<lb/>vation of the pre-lantibiotic can be monitored and quantified by integrating the leader peptide peaks, which are <lb/>used for calculation of the amount of activated lantibiotic. We observed for some I 1 mutants, that the properties <lb/>Figure 4. Fold of resistance of strains NZ9000-NisI, NZ9000-NisFEG, NZ9000-SaNSR and NZ9000-SaNsrFP in <lb/>comparison to NZ9000-Cm.

The <lb/>fold of resistance values were grouped in sub-groups of the I 1 mutants.

			<body>during the RP-HPLC runs of the pre-lantibiotics and activated lantibiotics made it impossible to distinguish <lb/>between both peaks (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consequently, the areas of leader peptide peaks were used for <lb/>quantification. One other aspect that has to be taken in consideration is the fact that for nisin mutants, such as I 1 A <lb/>or I 1 K, the core peptide cannot be purified by means of preparative RP-HPLC from the supernatant. In general, <lb/>the analytic RP-HPLC is needed to quantify the lantibiotic and as a quality control for the purification and the <lb/>cleavage reaction. <lb/>The major advantage of RP-HPLC compared to other technics is the more accurate determination of the con-<lb/>centration of the activated lantibiotic, which is a prerequisite for a reliable determination of the biological activity <lb/>of the lantibiotic. In comparison to methods determining the total amount of peptide/protein (e.g. BCA-assay <lb/>and other colorimetric assays) the determination via HPLC minimizes the error. For example, if only 15% of a <lb/>pre-lantibiotic is cleaved, but the total amount of pre-lantibiotic is used for the calculations, the determined IC 50 <lb/>value would be six to seven-fold larger, which obviously indicates a falsely lower antimicrobial activity. <lb/>Sometimes a lower cleavage efficiency of the leader peptidase and later a lower antimicrobial activity might <lb/>reflect incomplete modification of the peptide (e.g. dehydrations or the lack of lanthionine rings) or disrupted <lb/>recognition by the leader peptidase. As an example, the mutation of I 1 in nisin Z to tryptophan leads to the pro-<lb/>duction of two variants. The I 1 W mutant as a main product and a small amount of I1W/Dh2T, where the threo-<lb/>nine residue escape the dehydration and an altered activity is proposed 62 . Therefore, a proper determination of <lb/>dehydration and the formation of lanthionine rings by MS-analysis is required. MS-analysis provides information <lb/>about the dehydration reaction of NisB 63 by the loss of water (â18 Da), but cannot indicate the formation of the <lb/>(methyl-)lanthionine rings. Furthermore, it is not possible to distinguish between the position of the dehydration <lb/>within the nisin core peptide, which might have escaped modification like threonine position 2 or serine position <lb/>33 64 . Thus, it is inevitable to use at least one orthogonal method to determine the presence of lanthionine ring(s). <lb/>Either the use of an alkylation agent (e.g. CDAP to couple the free thiol group from cysteine residues) or tan-<lb/>dem MS-MS analysis to determine the alternate fragmentation pattern between WT pre-lantibiotic and potential <lb/>mutant variants is necessary. <lb/>In our protocol we choose the CDAP-coupling assay to detect nisin I 1 mutants, which might still possess free <lb/>thiol groups. The advantage of the CDAP-coupling assay is the additional mass shift in the MS spectra. Here, a <lb/>mass shift of 25 Da per thiol-conjugated easily indicates incomplete ring-formation. <lb/>The activated lantibiotic was used for antimicrobial activity assays (step VI), in which different indicator <lb/>strains were employed. Here, the assay for antimicrobial activity needs to be suitable for the characterisation of <lb/>the lantibiotic. The broth dilution with 2-fold dilution series of lantibiotics in a MIC assay is generally used to <lb/>determine the antimicrobial activity 65 . However, if only one stock concentration is used, one obvious limitation is <lb/>the factor two in serial dilutions, which will detect only changes larger than two. Therefore, we suggest to use the <lb/>IC 50 assay with a high diversity of stock concentrations to screen every data point. Still, both methods have their <lb/>limit as no information about the mode of action of the lantibiotic can be acquired. <lb/>The active lantibiotic were screened against a sensitive strain to determine the IC 50 value by growth inhibition <lb/>assay (described with modifications in 41 ). We used the L. lactis strain NZ9000 with the corresponding empty <lb/>vector systems pNZ-SV or pIL-SV, termed NZ9000-Erm and NZ9000-Cm, respectively. Generally, we would like <lb/>to propose that the strain L. lactis NZ9000 is used as a standard strain, in order to have comparable values from <lb/>antimicrobial activity assay. <lb/>The full potential of a lantibiotic or lantibiotic variants can be shrouded if the screen is only performed against <lb/>sensitive strains. Therefore, based on the IC 50 value from the sensitive strains, a second screen against strains, <lb/>which express immunity or resistance proteins should be performed 66 . We used the strains NZ9000-NisI and <lb/>NZ9000-NisFEG to study the effect of the immunity proteins from L. lactis as they confer immunity via dif-<lb/>ferent mechanisms 67,68 . To analyse the effect of a lantibiotic on resistance potency, strains NZ9000-SaNSR and <lb/>NZ9000-SaNsrFP expressing proteins involved the nisin resistance from Streptococcus agalactiae were used 42,66 . <lb/>Importantly, the ratio of the IC 50 values (fold of resistance) of these strains to the sensitive strain describes the <lb/>alteration of substrate specificity on the immunity or resistance proteins (described in 40 ). <lb/>As final remark, the production of lantibiotics, especially if they are heterologously expressed, has to be bench-<lb/>marked against a standardized lantibiotic. Here, the well-studied lantibiotic nisin can be used again to benchmark <lb/>against novel and unknown lantibiotics. <lb/>In summary, our analysis and the suggested roadmap demonstrate that a detailed and multifaceted investi-<lb/>gation of the antimicrobial potency of lantibiotic is necessary to uncover the full potential of novel lantibiotics, <lb/>but also to quantitatively compare the efficiency of different members of this promising family of antimicrobial <lb/>peptides. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Microorganisms and culture conditions.
