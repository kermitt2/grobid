			<front>Abstract <lb/>Most fungal viruses have been identified in plant pathogens, whereas the presence of viral <lb/>particles in human pathogenic fungi is less well studied. In the present study, we observed <lb/>extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of <lb/>Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface, <lb/>and species in this group are considered to be etiological factors in various skin diseases <lb/>including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA <lb/>segments and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the <lb/>Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel <lb/>protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-<lb/>free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were <lb/>down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were <lb/>increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly <lb/>larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection <lb/>dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic <lb/>acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-<lb/>derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to <lb/>the pathogenesis of Malassezia. <lb/></front>

			<body>Importance <lb/>Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is associated <lb/>with various skin diseases including dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Among Malassezia <lb/>species, M. restricta is the most widely observed species on the human skin. In the current <lb/>study, we identified a novel dsRNA virus, named MrV40, in M. restricta and characterized <lb/>the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with an independent satellite dsRNA <lb/>viral segment. Moreover, we found altered expression of genes involved in ribosomal <lb/>synthesis and programmed cell death, indicating that virus infection altered the physiology of <lb/>the fungal host cells. Our data also showed that the viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a <lb/>TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells <lb/>(BMDCs), indicating that a viral element likely contributes to the pathogenesis of Malassezia. <lb/>This is the first study to identify and characterize a novel mycovirus in Malassezia. <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Viruses have been observed in many fungal species since their first identification in <lb/>mushrooms (1). Fungal viruses, also known as mycoviruses, possess different forms of viral <lb/>genomes including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and <lb/>single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It is estimated that 30-80% of all fungal species, mainly <lb/>endophytic fungi, are infected with viruses. Unlike viruses that infect other organisms, the <lb/>transmission of fungal virus occurs vertically by cell division or horizontally via mating or <lb/>hyphal anastomosis, with no extracellular phase of the virus life cycle. dsRNA segments have <lb/>predominantly been found for fungal viruses and, taxonomically, the fungal dsRNA viruses <lb/>are classified into seven families: Chrysoviridae, Endornaviridae, Megabirnaviridae, <lb/>Quadriviridae, Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, and Totiviridae (2). <lb/>The model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae also carries a dsRNA virus that belongs to the <lb/>Totiviridae family and is known as the L-A virus. A unique feature of fungal viruses of the <lb/>Totiviridae family is their capability to produce the killer toxin that lyses susceptible neighbor <lb/>strains, whereas the virus-containing strain (also known as a killer strain) is immune to the <lb/>toxin. Studies of how the virus produces killer toxins in S. cerevisiae showed that killer toxins <lb/>are encoded by a satellite dsRNA segment, known as the M satellite, within the L-A virus. To <lb/>date, four different killer toxins, K1, K2, K28, and Klus have been described (3-6). The S. <lb/>cerevisiae L-A virus forms icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 39 nm (7). <lb/>The virus possesses a non-segmented 4.6-kb dsRNA genome consisting of two open reading <lb/>frames (ORFs), gag and pol, which overlap by 130 base pairs (bp) (8). gag encodes a major <lb/>76-kDa capsid protein (CP), and a 180-kDa minor protein species is encoded as a Gag-Pol <lb/>fusion protein by a −1 ribosomal frame-shift event (9, 10). The C-terminus of the Gag-Pol <lb/>. <lb/></body>

			<body>fusion protein possesses viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity (8). The <lb/>ribosomal frameshift is an interesting feature in a compact viral genome and has been <lb/>commonly found in various viral genomes as a mechanism to allow viruses to express <lb/>overlapping ORFs. Studies of S. cerevisiae L-A virus revealed that the mechanism of <lb/>frameshifting is based on the sequence structures including a canonical slippery heptamer, 5′-<lb/>X XXY YYZ-3′ (X= A, U or G; Y=A or U; Z=A, U, or C) and RNA pseudoknot (11). <lb/>Fungal viruses have also been considered as biocontrol agents in the field of agriculture. For <lb/>example, a virus causes hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica <lb/>(12, 13), and a virus mediates the biocontrol of other phytopathogenic fungi such as <lb/>Helminthosporium victoriae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Botrytis cinerea (14). <lb/>Although viral infections in fungal cells are widespread, the interactions between the fungal <lb/>virus and its host are not well understood. One of the most studied host defense mechanisms <lb/>is RNA silencing. Several studies have shown that RNA silencing functions as an antiviral <lb/>defense mechanism against C. parasitica in fungi. Disruption of the dicer pathway in C. <lb/>parasitica increases the susceptibility to virus infections (15), and p29 was identified as a <lb/>suppressor that inhibits expression of the genes required for RNA silencing-mediated viral <lb/>defense in the fungus (16). Similarly, conserved RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defense <lb/>systems have been identified in Aspergillus nidulans, Rosellinia necatrix, and Fusarium <lb/>graminearum (17-19). <lb/>Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is considered as <lb/>an etiological factor in various skin diseases including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and <lb/>atopic dermatitis (20-23). Eighteen Malassezia species have been identified; among them, M. <lb/>restricta is the most abundant on the human skin (20). Recent studies showed an increased <lb/></body>

			<body>burden of M. restricta on the scalp of patients with dandruff, indicating an association <lb/>between dandruff and the fungus although its role as a pathogenic organism is still unclear, <lb/>and the host susceptibility should be taken into consideration (21, 24-27). Most fungal viruses <lb/>are found in plant pathogenic fungi, whereas few examples of viral particles have been <lb/>identified in human pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans (28). In the present study, we <lb/>observed extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in various M. restricta clinical isolates which <lb/>represented a novel viral genome and its satellite. Sequence analysis revealed that the virus <lb/>belongs to the Totiviridae family and that the additional satellite dsRNA segment encodes a <lb/>novel protein. The interactions between the viral elements and the fungal host, and the impact <lb/>of the virus on fungal interactions with immune cells were evaluated. <lb/>Results <lb/>Identification of extrachromosomal dsRNA segments in Malassezia <lb/>Extrachromosomal nucleic acid bands were observed in total nucleic acid extracts of the M. <lb/>restricta strains isolated in our recent study (29). Among the strains, M. restricta KCTC <lb/>27540 was used to identify extrachromosomal segments. Total nucleic acids were extracted <lb/>from the strain and digested with DNase I, RNase A, and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal <lb/>segments and ribosomal RNA were resistant to DNase I, indicating that they were neither <lb/>ssDNA nor dsDNA. RNase A degraded all nucleic acids except for genomic DNA, whereas <lb/>RNase T1, which catalyzes the degradation of ssRNA, removed ribosomal RNA only (30). <lb/>These results suggested that the extrachromosomal segments correspond to dsRNA, and that <lb/>M. restricta KCTC 27540 possesses two separate extrachromosomal segments estimated by <lb/>agarose gel electrophoresis to be approximately 4.5 and 1.5 kb (Fig. 1A). <lb/></body>

			<body>To confirm whether the extrachromosomal segments observed in other M. restricta clinical <lb/>isolates were also dsRNA, total nucleic acid extracts from the strains other than M. restricta <lb/>KCTC 27540 were treated with DNAse I and RNase T1. The extrachromosomal segments <lb/>remained unaffected after enzyme treatment, indicating that they are also dsRNA, as in M. <lb/>restricta KCTC 27540 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, other Malassezia species including M. globosa, <lb/>M. pachydermatis, and M sympodialis showed similar extrachromosomal dsRNA segments <lb/>suggesting that these segments are common characteristics of Malassezia species (Fig. 1C). <lb/>Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed extrachromosomal segments composed of at least two <lb/>separate dsRNA fragments except for M. restricta KCTC 27543, which showed a single <lb/>dsRNA fragment. Additionally, the large fragments of dsRNA showed similar sizes (~5.0 kb), <lb/>whereas the small dsRNA segments varied in size in different strains (Fig. 1B and 1C). We <lb/>hypothesized that the dsRNA segments from Malassezia strains represent the dsRNA <lb/>elements of mycoviruses, which are prevalent in all major fungal taxa (2). <lb/>Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was conducted to purify virus particles to confirm that <lb/>the dsRNA segments in the Malassezia strains were indeed viral elements. The separated <lb/>nucleic acids and proteins in each fraction were analyzed. Two dsRNA fragments (~5.0 and <lb/>~1.7 kb) were clearly visible in fractions 1-6 following agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). <lb/>Moreover, the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-<lb/>PAGE) showed that fractions 3-6 contained protein bands with an estimated molecular <lb/>weight of ~77 kDa (Fig. 2B). This molecular weight is similar to that of the known capsid <lb/>protein of the S. cerevisiae mycovirus (9, 31, 32). Fractions 3-6 were subsequently evaluated <lb/>by microscopy to visualize mycovirus particles in M. restricta. Transmission electron <lb/>microscopy (TEM) images showed virus-like particles with an isometric shape and a <lb/></body>

			<body>diameter of 43 nm (Fig. 2C). These results support the hypothesis that the extrachromosomal <lb/>dsRNA segments formed the genome of mycovirus in M. restricta KCTC27540. We named <lb/>the viral particle as MrV40 (M. restricta KCTC Mycovirus). The large and small <lb/>dsRNA viral fragments were named as MrV40L and MrV40S, respectively. In addition to <lb/>evaluating images of the purified virus particle, we examined the morphology of M. restricta <lb/>KCTC27540 cells containing the mycovirus for comparison with virus-free cells of M. <lb/>restricta KCTC 27527 by TEM. The results showed that, in general, the size of vacuoles in <lb/>the virus-containing strain was significantly larger than those in the virus-free strain, <lb/>suggesting that the virus influences vacuole size in M. restricta (Fig. 3). <lb/>Determination of dsRNA sequence of MrV40L <lb/>The complete sequence of MrV40L was determined by a combination of the Illumina MiSeq <lb/>technique and the Sanger sequencing method using purified viral dsRNA. The length of the <lb/>complete assembled sequence of MrV40L was 4,606 bp, and two overlapping open reading <lb/>frames (ORFs), designated as ORF1 and ORF2, were identified (Fig. 4A). ORF1 corresponds <lb/>to the region from nucleotides (nt) 28 to 2,097 and encodes a polypeptide of 689 amino acids <lb/>with a molecular weight of 77 kDa. ORF2 corresponds to the region from nt 1,949 to 4,538 <lb/>and encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids with a molecular weight of 98 kDa. The results <lb/>of BLAST analysis showed that the protein sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 were highly <lb/>similar to the capsid protein (CP; the Pfam families of LA-virus_coat, PF09220) and viral <lb/>RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDRP; the Pfam family of RDRP_4, PF02123) of S. <lb/>segobiensis virus L belonging to the genus Totivirus (Totiviridae family) with 53% <lb/>(YP_009507830.1) and 52% (YP_009507831.1) identities, respectively (33).

			<body>motifs, which are commonly found in totiviruses, were found within ORF2, supporting the <lb/>classification of MrV40 as a totivirus (Fig. 4B) (34). Moreover, phylogenetic analysis with <lb/>known amino acid sequences of RDRP of dsRNA mycoviruses demonstrated that the RDRP <lb/>encoded by the MrV40L genome was clustered with totiviruses (Fig. 4C). Thus, MrV40L is a <lb/>dsRNA viral genome encoding CP and RDRP, and we propose that MrV40 belongs to the <lb/>Totivirus genus. <lb/>Next, we analyzed the genomic sequences of dsRNA viruses in other clinical M. restricta <lb/>isolates to confirm that they were similar to those of MrV40L, and thus belong to the <lb/>Totivirus genus. RT-PCR was performed using four primer sets corresponding to the sequence <lb/>of the conserved regions of CP and RDRP in the MrV40L genome (Fig. 5A). The results <lb/>showed that six of 11 viruses generated RT-PCR products, suggesting the presence of viral <lb/>genomes similar to MrV40Ls, while the remaining samples had dissimilar viral genomes (Fig. <lb/>5B). <lb/>Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic classification of the same viruses found in other <lb/>clinical M. restricta isolates by multilocus sequence typing of the 1,075-bp region, 638 bp of <lb/>ORF1, and 437 bp of ORF2, corresponding to gag and pol, respectively, within the viral <lb/>genomes. The results revealed that the viruses were classified into three clades: clade Ⅰ <lb/>(MrV12L, MrV16L, MrV40L, MrV79L, MrV80L, and MrV82L), clade Ⅱ (MrV18L, <lb/>MrV43L, MrV83L, and MrV50L), and clade Ⅲ (MrV24L) (Fig. 5C). Additionally, the <lb/>sequences of the 1,075-bp region of MrV40L, MrV79L, and MrV82L in the clade I were 100% <lb/>identical, suggesting that they originated from the same lineage. <lb/>Determination of dsRNA sequence of MrV40S <lb/></body>

			<body>To determine the sequence of MrV40S, the dsRNA segments of MrV40S were extracted from <lb/>agarose gels and then subjected to cDNA cloning and sequencing (See Materials and <lb/>Methods). Using the partial sequences obtained from cDNA clones and the sequences <lb/>obtained from repeated 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we successfully <lb/>determined the complete sequence of MrV40S. The sequence of MrV40S was 1,355 bp, and <lb/>a single ORF was identified in the 3′ region (from nt 773 to 1,097) which encoded a <lb/>polypeptide of 124 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa. The ORF was <lb/>designated as ORF3. Although we obtained the complete sequence of MrV40S, no <lb/>homologous protein sequence was identified by BLAST analysis using all currently available <lb/>databases. <lb/>Mycoviruses belonging to totivirus, particularly the S. cerevisiae LA-virus, often possess a <lb/>satellite dsRNA segment known as M dsRNA, which is responsible for producing a killer <lb/>toxin that excludes neighboring yeast cells. Because MrV40L resembles M dsRNA, we <lb/>predicted that MrV40S produces a protein that inhibits other Malassezia strains and/or other <lb/>fungal and/or bacterial cells residing on the skin. To test the toxin-like activity of the protein <lb/>produced from MrV40S, ORF3 was cloned and the protein was heterologously expressed in <lb/>Escherichia coli and purified (Fig. 6A). The activity of the purified protein was evaluated <lb/>against several pathogenic fungi and bacteria including M. restricta, C. albicans, <lb/>Cryptococcus neoformans, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Unexpectedly, the purified <lb/>protein displayed no growth inhibitory effect on the microbial cells tested (data not shown). <lb/>Based on these results, we concluded that the novel protein produced from ORF3 likely has <lb/>no toxin-like activity against the microorganisms tested, and further functional studies are <lb/>required to characterize its function. <lb/></body>

			<body>M dsRNA in S. cerevisiae produce several variants of killer toxins, M1, M2, M3, and Mlus, <lb/>and they showed limited homology in their protein sequences (4-6). Based on this <lb/>information, we compared the sequences of satellite dsRNA genomes between MrV40S and <lb/>that in other M. restricta strains containing the small dsRNA segments. Reverse transcription <lb/>(RT)-PCR was conducted using a series of primers specific to MrV40S. The results suggested <lb/>that among the nine strains tested, only the satellite dsRNA in M. restricta KCTC 27582 <lb/>possessed a similar dsRNA segment. These data indicate that the satellite dsRNA genome <lb/>sequences are highly variable (Fig. 6B). <lb/>MrV40 altered transcriptome profiles in the host M. restricta strain <lb/>To understand the influence of MrV40 on the host physiology, we sequenced and compared <lb/>the transcriptomes of M. restricta KCTC27540 containing MrV40 and a strain sterilized by <lb/>numerous serial passages, named as the virus-cured strain (see Materials and Methods, and <lb/>Fig. S1). Transcriptome analysis showed that 258 and 809 genes were up-and down-<lb/>regulated by more than 2-fold, respectively, in the virus-infected strain compared to the virus-<lb/>cured strain (Table 1 and Table S1). These results indicate that the presence of the virus may <lb/>impact a number of physiological processes in M. restricta. <lb/>In S. cerevisiae, numerous genes are known to be involved in maintaining its dsRNA virus <lb/>(35) and are categorized into two groups: MAK (maintenance of killer) and SKI (superkiller). <lb/>At least 25 MAK genes have been reported (36); among them, MAK3, MAK10, and PET18 <lb/>were shown to be required for the maintenance of both S. cerevisiae L-A virus and its M <lb/>satellite, whereas all other MAK genes are responsible only for the M satellite (37-42). We <lb/>couldn&apos;t find the homologs of MAK10 or PET18 in the genome of M. restricta, suggesting <lb/></body>

			<body>that a different or modified virus maintenance mechanism may be present in the fungus <lb/>compared to S. cerevisiae (Table 2). The results also showed that among the MAK homologs, <lb/>MAK1, MAK5, MAK11, MAK16, MAK21, MAK7, and MAK8 were downregulated by more <lb/>than 2-fold. In S. cerevisiae, these genes, except for MAK1, were involved in 60S ribosomal <lb/>subunit biosynthesis and M satellite maintenance. Thus, we predicted that MrV40 reduced <lb/>ribosomal biogenesis within the host. Additionally, M. restricta contained a series of SKI <lb/>homologs. However, no genes were differentially expressed in M. restricta KCTC27540 <lb/>containing MrV40 compared to the virus-cured strain, indicating that the function of SKI <lb/>genes was not critical for maintaining the virus. <lb/>In addition to the genes involved in virus maintenance, we observed upregulation of <lb/>numerous genes required for the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, including <lb/>MRET_1104 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 7), MRET_1378 (succinate <lb/>dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur subunit), MRET_1953 (NADH dehydrogenase <lb/>(ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 1), MRET_2042 (fumarate hydratase, class II), MRET_2097 <lb/>(succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), MRET_2956 (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 <lb/>component), MRET_3173 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) and MRET_4117 (aconitate <lb/>hydratase) (Table 3). These results suggest that virus maintenance and propagation may <lb/>require higher energy production in the host cell. <lb/>The overall dysregulation of primary metabolism may disturb the normal cell physiology in <lb/>the M. restricta strain infected with MrV40. Indeed, we observed up-regulation of genes <lb/>involved in programmed cell death in the fungal host cells. For example, the expression of <lb/>MRET_3200 (p38 MAP kinase), MRET_1134 (programmed cell death 6-interacting protein), <lb/>and MRET_2499 (autophagy-related protein, ATG101), which are associated with <lb/>programmed cell death, was upregulated by 4.43-, 3.14-, and 2.83-fold in the virus-infected <lb/></body>

			<body>fungal cells, respectively. Moreover, MRET_0103 (FAS-associated factor), which is involved <lb/>in Fas-induced cell death, was found to be strongly upregulated (8.80-fold) in the presence of <lb/>the virus within the fungal host (43). It is well-known that programmed cell death is triggered <lb/>during virus infection (44, 45), and our findings agree with this observation. Differential <lb/>expression of numerous genes involved in energy metabolism and programmed cell death <lb/>may have influenced the abnormally larger vacuole in the MrV40-containing strain observed <lb/>by TEM (Fig. 3C). <lb/>MrV40 induced the TLR3-mediated immune system <lb/>Since it was first reported that fungal viral dsRNA induces cytokine production in rabbits (46-<lb/>48), several studies have demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays a central role in <lb/>viral dsRNA recognition and production of inflammatory cytokines in innate immune cells <lb/>(49, 50). Additionally, a recent study showed that S. cerevisiae viral dsRNA stimulates the <lb/>immune system through TLR3 in a human embryonic kidney cell line (51). We therefore <lb/>investigated whether MrV40 itself or the virus-containing Malassezia cells alter the <lb/>expression patterns of TLRs and cytokine production in mammalian cells. To this end, bone <lb/>marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) obtained from C57BL/6 mice, which have been <lb/>used as a model to study the interactions between fungal cells, including Malassezia, and the <lb/>innate immune system in a mammalian host (52, 53), were used in our study. <lb/>Purified MrV40 dsRNA, capsid protein of MrV40, total cell lysates of virus-infected M. <lb/>restricta strains (KCTC 27540 and KCTC 27550), and virus-free M. restricta strains (KCTC <lb/>27527 and KCTC 27539) were co-incubated with BMDCs, and the expression of TLRs and <lb/>cytokines were analyzed.

			<body>purified dsRNA, whereas the expression of other TLRs were unchanged. These results were <lb/>supported by observation of highly increased expression of TLR3 in the cell lysates of the <lb/>virus-infected Malassezia strains KCTC 27527 and KCTC 27539 compared to virus-free <lb/>strains. However, the purified capsid protein from MrV40 did not alter the expression level of <lb/>any TLR, indicating that dsRNA, but not the capsid protein, induced TLR3 expression (Fig. <lb/>7A). <lb/>We also evaluated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis <lb/>factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-γ, in response to <lb/>MrV40 dsRNA, capsid protein, and M. restricta cell extracts with or without the virus. <lb/>Particularly, IFN-α and IFN-γ were examined because they are known to be involved in the <lb/>antiviral response in mammals (54). The results of the cytokine analysis indicated that <lb/>purified MrV40 dsRNA and the cell extracts of the M. restricta strains containing the virus <lb/>showed significantly increased production of all cytokines tested. However, a relatively small <lb/>increase was observed in BMDCs treated with purified capsid protein, suggesting that the <lb/>MrV40 capsid contributes to cytokine production, but the contribution of the protein is <lb/>marginal (Fig. 7B). Cytokine profiles were also measured in homozygous TLR3 knockout <lb/>mice, as our observations suggested a connection between TLR3 and cytokine production <lb/>upon MrV40 treatment. As shown in Fig. 7B, compared to wild-type BMDCs, cytokine levels <lb/>in BMDCs isolated from TLR3 knockout mice were not significantly altered. These data <lb/>suggest that increased production of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-α, and IFN-γ in <lb/>response to MrV40 was TLR3-dependent in BMDCs. Our data also showed that the MrV40 <lb/>capsid proteins caused a marginal increase in cytokine expression in both wild-type and TLR3 <lb/>knockout BMDCs, indicating that the response to the viral capsid is TLR3-independent. <lb/></body>

			<body>Notably, small increases in the production of TNF-α and IFN-α in TLR3 knockout mice in <lb/>response to the cell extract of virus-infected M. restricta KCTC were ignored in our <lb/>results because only one sample among the two virus-infected strains displayed an increase. <lb/>The change in IL-10 in the same mutant BMDCs was also excluded because the differences <lb/>were statistically insignificant. Overall, our data suggest that dsRNA in MrV40 triggers an <lb/>increase in the production of cytokines involved in inflammation and that TLR3 plays a <lb/>central role in the host response. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In the current study, we detected dsRNA virus in several clinical isolates of Malassezia <lb/>species. Among them, MrV40 identified in M. restricta KCTC 27540 was selected, and its <lb/>genome structure, effects on host gene expression, and influence on the mammalian immune <lb/>response were evaluated. Our data showed that MrV40 consists of two RNA segments, which <lb/>we named as MrV40L and MrV40S. The results of genome sequence analysis suggested that <lb/>these segments were 4,606 and 1,355 bp, respectively, and belong to the totivirus. Typically, <lb/>the genomes of the viruses belonging to the genus Totivirus consist of non-segmented dsRNA <lb/>with sizes between 4.6 and 7.0 kb, and contain two ORFs, gag and pol. Studies have <lb/>specifically examined the genome structure of Totivirus because of the overlapping nature of <lb/>the two ORFs, where a -1 frameshift occurs, resulting translation of the fusion protein (2). <lb/>The overlapping ORFs and frameshift were frequently observed in a compact viral genome to <lb/>translate proteins and were found in several dsRNA and ssRNA viruses; these ORFs allow <lb/>ribosomes to translate CP and RDRP continuously with a missing CP termination codon (11, <lb/>55, 56). It was reported that the mechanism of frameshifting in the viral genome is based on <lb/></body>

			<body>the pseudoknot structure of the mRNA for efficient slipping via a slippery site (57). For <lb/>example, in the genome of the S. cerevisiae L-A virus, the 5′ ORF (gag) encodes a 76-kDa <lb/>CP and the 3′ ORF (pol) encodes an RDRP which is expressed as a 180-kDa CP-RDRP <lb/>fusion protein generated by a -1 ribosomal frameshift (8, 11). In our study, MrV40L (the <lb/>major dsRNA segment in MrV40) contained two overlapping ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2. We <lb/>identified a putative slippery site heptamer, 5′-GGGTTTT-3′, at the region from nt 1, 968 to <lb/>1,974 for the -1 ribosomal frameshift, which may be associated with production of the fusion <lb/>protein of 170 kDa in MrV40L. A previous study suggested that in the S. cerevisiae L-A virus, <lb/>the rate of ribosomal frameshifs was approximately 1.8%, giving 120 CP and 2 CP-RDRP <lb/>fusion protein molecules per virus particle (11). Considering the low efficiency of producing <lb/>the fusion proteins by ribosomal frameshifting, we expected to observe a significantly lower <lb/>translation rate of the fusion protein; indeed, the putative 170-kDa band was not detected by <lb/>SDS-PAGE. In addition to MrV40L, we determined the sequence of the satellite dsRNA <lb/>segment MrV40S and found that it consists of 1,355 nt containing a single ORF, ORF3, <lb/>producing a novel 15.6-kDa protein. As observed for other totiviruses, the possible toxin-like <lb/>activity of the protein was investigated in our study, but no growth inhibitory activity against <lb/>several bacteria and fungi was observed. <lb/>It has been estimated that 30-80% of fungal species in nature are infected with viruses, and a <lb/>fungal host normally shows no specific symptoms upon infection (14). However, several <lb/>genes were shown to be required for maintaining and propagating viruses in the host fungal <lb/>cells. In S. cerevisiae, numerous chromosomal genes are known to be involved in viral <lb/>propagation and expression of the viral killer toxin (35). Furthermore, several genes are <lb/>known to be responsible for maintaining the L-A virus and M dsRNA in S. cerevisiae. The <lb/>MAK genes are required for the propagation and maintenance of the L-A virus and M dsRNA <lb/></body>

			<body>in S. cerevisiae (58). Among the MAK genes, MAK3, MAK10, and PET18 are required for the <lb/>maintenance of both L-A virus and M dsRNA, whereas all other MAK genes are responsible <lb/>only for M dsRNA (37-42). Particularly, MAK3 encodes an N-acetyltransferase and is <lb/>required for N-acetylation of the coat protein (37, 59). A previous study showed that the coat <lb/>proteins without acetylation failed to self-assemble, resulting in the loss of all dsRNA viruses <lb/>(38). MAK10 and PET18 (MAK30+MAK31) encode a non-catalytic subunit of N-terminal <lb/>acetyltransferase and a protein of unknown function, respectively. Mutant strains lacking <lb/>each gene contained unstable viral particles, indicating that the genes are involved in the <lb/>structural stability of LA-virus and M dsRNA (39). MAK1 (MAK17, TOP1) encodes DNA <lb/>topoisomerase I, and other MAK genes including MAK2, MAK5, MAK11, MAK16, MAK21, <lb/>MAK7 (RPL4A), MAK8 (TCM1), and MAK18 (RPL41B) are related to 60S ribosomal subunit <lb/>assembly (42, 60, 61). All mutant stains lacking the above genes showed decreased levels of <lb/>free 60S ribosomal subunits and the inability to maintain M dsRNA, suggesting that stable <lb/>propagation of the satellite dsRNA depends on 60S ribosome synthesis (41, 42). In addition <lb/>to the MAK genes, the SKI gene family has been shown to be involved in the maintenance <lb/>and propagation of virus in S. cerevisiae. SKI1 (XRN1) encoding a 5′-3′ exonuclease is <lb/>involved in the degradation of uncapped mRNA including viral mRNA, and SKI2, SKI3, <lb/>SKI6, SKI7, and SKI8 block the translation of viral mRNAs (62-64). <lb/>In the current study, homologs of most MAK and SKI genes were identified in M. restricta. <lb/>The results of the transcriptome analysis suggested that most MAK genes were downregulated, <lb/>which may in turn reduce ribosome synthesis in the M. restricta strain containing MrV40. In <lb/>contrast, no SKI homolog showed significantly altered transcript levels in the M. restricta <lb/>strain harboring MrV40. Moreover, we found increased expression of genes involved in <lb/></body>

			<body>energy metabolism and programmed cell death in the M. restricta strain containing the virus. <lb/>Overall, our transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of only a few genes was <lb/>altered upon virus infection in M. restricta. Although the differential expression patterns <lb/>differed from that of M. restricta, S. cerevisiae also displayed relatively small changes in <lb/>fungal host gene expression upon virus infection, possibly because of co-adaptation of the <lb/>virus within the fungal host (65). Maintenance and propagation of virus within the fungal <lb/>host may be involved in the post-transcriptional mechanism and may contribute to the <lb/>minimal changes in host gene expression. Notably, the possibility that an RNA silencing <lb/>pathway in M. restricta cells influences virus maintenance was excluded because of the <lb/>absence of homologous genes required for the pathway in the genome of the fungus. <lb/>In addition to transcriptome analysis, we directly investigated whether the virus influences <lb/>the cellular morphology of M. restricta and the structures of its intracellular organelles by <lb/>TEM. We observed significantly larger vacuoles in virus-infected M. restricta cells. An <lb/>increased vacuole size upon virus infection has been reported previously. The <lb/>phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis porri infected with dsRNA virus 1 showed the formation of <lb/>abundant vacuoles (66), and turnip mosaic virus induced the large central vacuole in <lb/>Nicotiana benthamiana plant cells (67). Particularly, in N. benthamiana, turnip mosaic virus <lb/>particles were shown to accumulate in vacuoles and be protected by the organelle membranes <lb/>against the harsh host environment, particularly during xylem vessel differentiation. <lb/>Furthermore, virus accumulation in vacuoles in plant-to-plant virus transmission has been <lb/>suggested (67). Although the expression of genes involved in vacuole biogenesis was not <lb/>altered in transcriptome analysis in M. restricta cells containing the virus, there may be a <lb/>relationship between vacuole functions and MrV40 in M. restricta. Therefore, additional <lb/></body>

			<body>physiological studies are needed. <lb/>TLR3 is well-conserved in most vertebrates, localizes on the endosomal transmembrane, and <lb/>plays a role in immune and non-immune cells. It has been suggested that TLR3 senses viral <lb/>dsRNA taken up through endocytosis and contributes to defending the host against viral <lb/>infection by regulating the expression of a range of cytokines (49, 68). A previous study <lb/>demonstrated a significant decrease in cytokines (IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-12p40) and increase <lb/>in viral PFU in the spleen of Tlr3 −/− mice infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (69). We <lb/>found that TLR3 expression was significantly increased by purified dsRNA from the MrV40 <lb/>particles and cell lysates of M. restricta containing the virus. The dsRNA and cell lysates also <lb/>showed increased production of cytokines involved in inflammation. However, in Tlr3 −/− <lb/>BMDCs, the production of all cytokines in the cells treated with purified dsRNA from <lb/>MrV40 and cell lysates of virus containing M. restricta was attenuated, suggesting that TLR3 <lb/>plays a central role in the host response against dsRNA of MrV40 and mediates the <lb/>production of the cytokines. Similarly, the Leishmania parasite L. guyanensis infected with <lb/>the dsRNA virus belonging to Totivirus induced a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune <lb/>response within the vertebrate host, indicating that the Leishmania RNA virus (LRV1) <lb/>functions as an innate immunogen. Moreover, in Leishmania, LRV1 was suggested to <lb/>stimulate the inflammatory immune response and increase the severity and persistence of the <lb/>parasite (70). However, whether MrV40 causes hyper-or hypo-pathogenesis of M. restricta <lb/>remains unclear. Therefore, further studies to characterize the potential function of MrV40 as <lb/>an innate immunogen are needed. <lb/>Overall, our study demonstrated the existence of a dsRNA virus within M. restricta. We also <lb/>determined the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with the independent RNA <lb/></body>
