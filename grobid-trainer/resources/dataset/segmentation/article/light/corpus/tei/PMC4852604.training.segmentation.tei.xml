			<body>Introduction <lb/>Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most <lb/>common disorders in the field of neurosurgery. 2) The current <lb/>understanding of the mechanism of development of CSDH <lb/>is that damage to the bridging veins by minor head trauma <lb/>results in a collection of hematomas in the subdural space. 15) <lb/>Then, the hematomas form a vessel-rich outer membrane. 18,21) <lb/>Fragility of this neovasculature leads to repeated micro-<lb/>bleeding and increases the permeability of the membrane, <lb/>resulting in the development of CSDH. 2,3,13,14) The known <lb/>risk factors of CSDH are trauma, old age, brain atrophy, al-<lb/>cohol abuse, seizure, coagulopathy, the use of anti-platelets, <lb/>and the use of anticoagulants. 7,10) In this study, we focused <lb/>on the fact that some patients do not develop CSDH after <lb/>head trauma and proceed through therapy without any com-<lb/>plications, while others need additional surgeries to treat <lb/>CSDH. Assuming there are differences between the pa-<lb/>tients who develop CSDH and those who do not, we inves-<lb/>tigated the various known risk factors, along with the com-<lb/>puted tomographic findings at the time of the head injury. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>We conducted a survey of 277 patients who scored over <lb/>13 on the Glasgow coma scale who received treatment at <lb/>our institution after minor head trauma in the period from <lb/>January 2012 to December 2013. Patients were enrolled pro-<lb/>spectively and their medical records were reviewed retro-<lb/>spectively. All the patients did not require surgery at the time <lb/>of their arrival. During the follow-up period, the 20 patients <lb/>who required surgery to treat CSDH were designated as the <lb/></body>

However not all patients de-<lb/>velop CSDH after minor head trauma. In this study, we evaluate the risk factors of post-traumatic CSDH. <lb/>Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study from January 2012 to Decem-<lb/>ber 2013. Of those, 20 participants had minor head trauma developed CSDH afterward. We also included 257 patients with <lb/>minor head trauma who did not develop CSDH during the same follow-up period as the control group. We investigated the <lb/>risk factors related to the development of CSDH after minor head trauma. <lb/>Results: Old age (p=0.014), preexisting diabetes mellitus (p=0.010), hypertension (p=0.026), history of cerebral infarction <lb/>(p=0.035), antiplatelet agents (p=0.000), acute subdural hematoma in the convexity (p=0.000), encephalomalacia (p= <lb/>0.029), and long distance between skull and brain parenchyma (p=0.000) were significantly correlated with the develop-<lb/>ment of CSDH after trauma. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the maximum distance between the skull and the cere-<lb/>bral parenchyma was the independent risk factor for the occurrence of CSDH (hazard ratio 2.55, p=0.000). <lb/>Conclusion: We should consider the possibility of developing CSDH in the post-traumatic patients with the identified risk <lb/>factors. <lb/>(Korean J Neurotrauma 2014;10(2):106-111) <lb/>KEY WORDS: Hematoma subdural chronic ㆍRisk factors ㆍCraniocerebral trauma. <lb/>Received: September 16, 2014 / Revised: October 13, 2014 <lb/>Accepted: October 15, 2014 <lb/>Address for correspondence: Seung-Won Choi, MD <lb/>Department of Neurosurgery, School of Medicine, Chungnam Na-<lb/>tional University, 282 Munhwa-ro, Jung-gu, Daejeon 301-721, Korea <lb/>Tel: +82-42-280-7361, Fax: +82-42-280-7363 <lb/>E-mail: swchoi@cnu.ac.kr <lb/>CLINICAL ARTICLE <lb/>Korean J Neurotrauma 2014;10(2):106-111 <lb/>pISSN 2234-8999 / eISSN 2288-2243 <lb/>http://dx.doi.org/10.13004/kjnt.2014.10.2.106 <lb/>online © ML Comm <lb/></front>

			<body>patient group, while the remaining 257 patients who did not <lb/>develop CSDH after minor head trauma and completed treat-<lb/>ment were selected as the control group. Head trauma, out <lb/>of many other factors, was set as the controlled variable. Age, <lb/>gender, and the history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hyper-<lb/>tension, cerebral infarction, cardiac disease, hematologic dis-<lb/>ease, and epilepsy were investigated as the factors contrib-<lb/>uting to progression of CSDH after minor trauma. The me-<lb/>dication history of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents was <lb/>also surveyed, as well as the smoking and drinking habits <lb/>of subjects. The presence of acute subdural hematoma (AS-<lb/>DH) in the convexity, accompanying hemorrhage and en-<lb/>cephalomalacia, and the maximum distance from skull to <lb/>cerebral parenchyma (Figure 1) were investigated by exam-<lb/>ining the patients&apos; initial computerized tomography (CT) <lb/>scans. In our study, cardiac disease included valve disease, <lb/>arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease. The diseases that <lb/>could cause coagulopathy, such as hematological malignan-<lb/>cies, were defined as hematologic disease. In cases where <lb/>the patients&apos; initial brain CT scans showed cerebral contu-<lb/>sion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, or <lb/>intracerebral hemorrhage, we defined the finding as an ac-<lb/>companying hemorrhage. The statistical analysis was per-<lb/>formed using Window SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chi-<lb/>cago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses included chi-square test, <lb/>Fisher&apos;s exact test and multivariate logistic regression anal-<lb/>ysis to assess the relationship between CSDH and various <lb/>factors. Differences were considered statistically significant <lb/>if the p value was less than 0.05. <lb/>Results <lb/>Demographic data, medical history, social history, and <lb/>CT findings are summarized in Table 1. <lb/>The number of patients enrolled in the study was 277, with <lb/>an age range of 0 to 94 years, and a mean age of 53.9 years. <lb/>The average age of the patient group was 67.5 years, while <lb/>that of the control group was 52.9 years, showing that the <lb/>patient group was statistically significantly older than the <lb/>control group (p=0.014)(Figure 2). Thirteen male patients <lb/>(65%) and 7 female patients (35%) were in the patient group, <lb/>while 173 male patients (67.3%) and 84 female patients (37.7%) <lb/>made up the control group with males contributing a little <lb/>higher number in both groups, without a noticeable signifi-<lb/>cance in the gender difference (p=0.832). <lb/>TABLE 1.

			<body>In the patient group, there were 7 (35%) patients with DM <lb/>and 12 (65%) patients with hypertension, while there were <lb/>35 (13.6%) patients with DM and 90 (35.0%) patients with <lb/>hypertension in the control group. The presence of DM or <lb/>hypertension showed a statistical significance between <lb/>groups (p=0.010, p=0.026). <lb/>The numbers of the patients with a history of cerebral in-<lb/>farction were 3 (15%) in the patient group and 11 (4.3%) in <lb/>the control group, which was also statistically significant <lb/>(p=0.035). <lb/>With regards to medication history, the administration of <lb/>antiplatelet agents presented a statistically significant dif-<lb/>ference between the two groups (p=0.000); 10 in the patient <lb/>group (50%), 45 in the control group (17.5%). <lb/>The brain CT scans taken on the time of admission were <lb/>examined. A higher percentage of subjects in the patient <lb/>group (15 patients, 75%) had ASDH in the convexity from <lb/>the trauma than that of patients in the control group (78 pa-<lb/>tients, 28.4%) at a level of statistical significance (p=0.000). <lb/>Four subjects in the patient group (20%) had encephalo-<lb/>malacia, while 17 patients (6.6%) in the control group had <lb/>the affliction with statistically significant (p=0.029). <lb/>The brain CT scans taken right after the trauma were used <lb/>to measure the maximum distance between the skull and <lb/>the cerebral parenchyma. The average maximum distance <lb/>of the patient group (7.15 mm) was much longer than that of <lb/>the control group (1.35 mm) and the difference was statisti-<lb/>cally significant (p=0.000)(Figure 3). The receiver operat-<lb/>ing characteristic curve was drawn by plotting the occur-<lb/>rence of CSDH according to the maximum distance between <lb/>the skull and the brain parenchyma. It was determined to <lb/>be reliable test model due to its large area under the curve. <lb/>We found that the distance between the skull and parenchy-<lb/>ma as 3.52 mm can be a cutoff value, yielding 90.0% sensi-<lb/>tivity and 90.7% specificity (Figure 4). <lb/>The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to <lb/>verify the correlation between the statistically significant <lb/>factors and CSDH occurrence. As a result, only the maxi-<lb/>mum distance between the skull and the cerebral parenchy-<lb/>ma showed a reliable correlation with CSDH occurrence (p= <lb/>0.000), while the other factors failed to show any remarkable <lb/>statistical significance (Table 2). <lb/>Each group was classified according to the type of trau-<lb/>ma. Slipping down stood out as the most common cause of <lb/>trauma but with no statistical significance between the two <lb/>groups (p=0.236)(Table 3). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Unlike other studies, 7,10) this study demonstrates that the <lb/>presence of DM or hypertension significantly influences <lb/>the occurrence of CSDH after minor head trauma.

			<body>contrary, a study conducted by Yamamoto et al. 22) reported <lb/>that the hyperglycemia in DM patients leads to the hyper-<lb/>viscosity of blood and increases the intravascular osmotic <lb/>pressure, resulting in a reduced probability of CSDH recur. <lb/>However, considering the fact that one of the major compli-<lb/>cations of DM is capillary vasculopathy such as retinal hem-<lb/>orrhage, and the fact that micro-bleedings and the exuda-<lb/>tion of immature capillaries surrounding the CSDH outer <lb/>membrane are the major mechanisms in developing CSDH, <lb/>the capillary vasculopathy in DM patients affects the im-<lb/>mature capillaries around the outer membrane of the sub-<lb/>dural hematoma after head trauma, and consequently re-<lb/>sults in the development CSDH. 20) <lb/>Also, in the case of patients with hypertension, higher <lb/>blood pressures put more pressure on the immature capil-<lb/>laries around the outer membrane have to endure, increas-<lb/>ing the probability of repeated capillary injuries and micro-<lb/>bleedings. Even though there are few preexisting studies on <lb/>the impact of hypertension on the CSDH, 8) additional stud-<lb/>ies need to be performed to confirm a correlation between <lb/>hypertension and CSDH. <lb/>It is known that the old age is associated with CSDH, as <lb/>there is a higher CSDH prevalence rate among the elder-<lb/>ly. 1,5,6) The fragility of the bridging veins and accompany-<lb/>ing cerebral atrophy from the aging process are considered <lb/>as the major factors causing the increased prevalence. 5,19) As <lb/>aging progresses, the volume of the cerebral parenchyma <lb/>shrinks, resulting in an increase of the subdural space be-<lb/>tween the skull and the cerebral parenchyma. The enlarged <lb/>subdural space enables the brain to move around the skull <lb/>while patient ambulates, and the vulnerable bridging veins <lb/>can be injured easily with a minor head trauma. 9,12,23) The <lb/>correlation between the occurrence of CSDH and old age <lb/>was also confirmed in this study, and there was a tendency <lb/>to develop post-traumatic CSDH among the patients with <lb/>larger subdural spaces due to cerebral atrophy. The reason <lb/>why the history of cerebral infarction and the presence of <lb/>encephalomalacia are correlated with CSDH occurrence in <lb/>this study can be explained by considering the same mech-<lb/>anism described above. The presence of encephalomalacia <lb/>after the brain injury, such as cerebral infarction, results in <lb/>the reduction of brain parenchyma volume, which enlarges <lb/>the subdural space between the skull and brain parenchy-<lb/>ma, and consequently results in higher tendency of post-trau-<lb/>matic CSDH. 16) <lb/>A study from Lindvall and Koskinen, 10) which analyzed <lb/>71 patients with CSDH concluded that the administration <lb/>of antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents contributed a sig-<lb/>nificant difference in CSDH occurrence in the patients with-<lb/>out trauma compared to the patients with trauma.

			<body>study conducted by Reymond et al. 17) analyzing 198 patients <lb/>with severe head trauma also reported that there was a sta-<lb/>tistical significance between the administration of anti-<lb/>platelet or anticoagulation agents in CSDH occurrence. <lb/>Considering the analogous result in the preceding two stud-<lb/>ies, the same outcome was expected when analyzing our <lb/>data. However, there was no statistically significant differ-<lb/>ence between using anticoagulation agents and the occur-<lb/>rence of CSDH, while there was a significant correlation be-<lb/>tween the use of antiplatelet agents and the occurrence of <lb/>CSDH. While the preceding studies analyzed patients who <lb/>already developed CSDH or had severe head trauma, we in-<lb/>cluded all the patients with minor head trauma, which may <lb/>explain the difference in the outcome. Also, the fact that the <lb/>patient group only had a limited number of the patients may <lb/>be related to the difference as well. <lb/>It was expected that there would be a correlation between <lb/>CSDH occurrence and the patients with cerebral infarction <lb/>or with cardiac disease, as they are commonly administered <lb/>antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. 10) The actual study <lb/>showed a higher ratio of patients with cerebral infarction <lb/>or cardiac disease in the patient group than in the control <lb/>group. However, only the history of cerebral infarction dem-<lb/>onstrated a statistically significant difference, while the <lb/>presence of cardiac disease failed to show a statistical sig-<lb/>nificance. With regard to cerebral infarction, aside from us-<lb/>ing antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, other co-factors, <lb/>such as a decrease in brain volume due to encephalomala-<lb/>cia after infarction, could influence the outcome. Also, the <lb/>insufficient number of the patients analyzed in the patient <lb/>group is likely the reason why we could not find a signifi-<lb/>cance relationship between CSDH occurrence and the pres-<lb/>ence of cardiac disease. <lb/>Generally, the hematologic diseases that cause coagulop-<lb/>athy are known to be risk factors for post-traumatic CSDH <lb/>occurrence. 1,4) The history of epilepsy is also expected to be <lb/>a risk factor of CSDH since it can cause repeated seizures. 1,11) <lb/>We began our analysis considering these known concepts, <lb/>but the history of hematologic diseases and epilepsy showed <lb/>no significant differences in our study. Yet, there was no pa-<lb/>tient with a history of hematologic diseases or epilepsy in <lb/>the patient group, and a very small number of the patients <lb/>with a history of hematologic diseases (1.1%) or epilepsy <lb/>(1.4%) were present among the entire test population. It is <lb/>assumed that the limited number of patients analyzed in the <lb/>study impacted the result as well. <lb/>Limitations of the current study include the small num-<lb/>ber of patient group and the retrospective nature of the study <lb/>design. However this study creatively demonstrated the pre-<lb/>dictive factors of CSDH in patients with minor head trauma. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Based on the results of this study, the predictive factors <lb/>of post-traumatic CSDH occurrence are old age, preexisting <lb/>DM, hypertension, and history of cerebral infarction, the <lb/>presence of ASDH in the convexity found in brain CT scans <lb/>taken right after the trauma, encephalomalacia, and an en-<lb/>larged subdural space between skull and brain parenchyma. <lb/>When treating patients with minor head trauma accompa-<lb/>nied by those risk factors, physicians must pay careful at-<lb/>tention to the possibility of post-traumatic CSDH and need <lb/>to continuously observe the patients. <lb/>■ The authors have no financial conflicts of interest. <lb/></body>
