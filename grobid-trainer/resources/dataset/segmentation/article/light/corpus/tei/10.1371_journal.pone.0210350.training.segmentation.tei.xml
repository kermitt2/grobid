			<body>Introduction <lb/>Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the airways and other structures of the <lb/>lungs commonly include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, <lb/>respiratory allergies, and occupational lung diseases [1]. Globally in 2016 CRDs, in particular, <lb/>COPD and Asthma affected 251 [2] and 339 [3] million people respectively. In the same year <lb/>2016, COPD caused about 3.2 million deaths worldwide, in which low and middle-income <lb/>countries (LMIC) accounted for more than 90% of those deaths [2]. The deaths related to <lb/>CRDs in these LMIC are commonly due to lack of proper management [1,4,5]. In sub-Saharan <lb/>Africa (SSA) including Tanzania, CRDs, in particular, COPD and Asthma have been a silent <lb/>killer of many people [6,7]. <lb/>The established commonest cause of CRDs is tobacco smoking, and indoor air pollution <lb/>[2]. However, in SSA the burden and risks of CRDs are high greatly fueled by indoor air pollu-<lb/>tion from the high-level use of biomass fuel, HIV/AIDS pandemic, Pulmonary Tuberculosis <lb/>(PTB) and pneumonia [7,8]. For instance, the proportion of households using biomass fuel in <lb/>this region ranges from 86-99% and 26-96% in rural and urban areas respectively [9]. In Tan-<lb/>zanian, more than 90% of energy sources for cooking, heating, and lighting comes from solid <lb/>biomass fuels such as firewood and charcoal [9]. Tobacco smoking prevalence is 14% for men <lb/>and 0.6% in females [10], however, the COPD burden is also high among the female popula-<lb/>tion due to indoor air pollution during cooking. The previous study conducted in rural Tanza-<lb/>nia found that the prevalence of COPD was 17.5% (21.7% in males and 12.9%), and the <lb/>associated causal risks were exposure to biomass fuel, pulmonary tuberculosis, and tobacco <lb/>smoking [11]. On the other hand, the prevalence of self-reported Asthma among secondary <lb/>school student in urban and rural Tanzania was found to be 17.6% and 6.4% respectively [12]. <lb/>Furthermore, CRDs in particular COPD is potentially associated with extra-pulmonary mani-<lb/>festation including cardiovascular disease (CVD) hence patients are more likely to die from <lb/>acute cardiovascular events than the primary lung pathology [13]. The extra-pulmonary mani-<lb/>festations of COPD also have been reported in Tanzania among patients with COPD in which <lb/>15.4% and 24% of study participants had CVDs and albuminuria (a marker of vascular endo-<lb/>thelial dysfunction) respectively [14]. <lb/>Generally, management of patients with CRDs is based on diagnosis confirmation and <lb/>proper management of the symptoms to prevent acute exacerbation [15]. Despite the spirome-<lb/>try is the Gold standard for diagnosis of CRDs, a peak flow meter can be used to diagnose <lb/>bronchial asthma in repeated measurement. However, it should not be used as a substitute for <lb/>the spirometry [15]. In management or control of the symptomatic CRDs may include the use <lb/>of inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. salbutamol), and corticosteroids like beclomethasone and <lb/>budesonide [15,16]. These basic medicines are of very important for life serving and as con-<lb/>troller of disease symptoms. However, previous studies showed that there is a scarcity of diag-<lb/>nostic equipment and basic medicines for CRDs at many health facilities in SSA including <lb/></body>

			<body>Tanzania [7]. Traditionally, the Tanzanian health system is designed to provide Reproductive <lb/>Health services and manage communicable diseases which are more prevalent than non-com-<lb/>municable diseases (NCD). Despite the increase in NCD cases that create a double burden sit-<lb/>uation within the country, the budget and resources allocation is still insufficient for <lb/>management of NCD such as CRDs [17]. Recent studies in Tanzania have shown that the pri-<lb/>mary health care facilities are not adequately equipped to respond to the increasing burden of <lb/>hypertension and diabetes mellitus [18,19]. However, it is not known whether or not the <lb/>healthcare facilities are adequately equipped and ready to provide management for CRDs. <lb/>Therefore, this study sought to explore the availability of services and factors associated <lb/>with the readiness of health facilities to manage CRDs in Tanzania. This will help to inform <lb/>the policymakers the area which requires necessary improvement given the high burden of <lb/>CRDs and associated risk factors. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Data source <lb/>The current study based on the secondary data analysis of the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service <lb/>Provision Assessment (TSPA) Survey. The original TSPA survey was conducted by the Tanza-<lb/>nia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW). Technical support for the survey was <lb/>provided by ICF International under the DHS Program. The United States Agency for Inter-<lb/>national Development (USAID/Tanzania) provided financial support. The TSPA survey was <lb/>designed to gather important information on the availability and readiness of the basic health <lb/>care services at Tanzania health facilities. The aim was to assess the presence and function of <lb/>components essential for quality services delivery in the following areas; NCD, Family Plan-<lb/>ning (FP), Antenatal care (ANC), Child Health, Maternal and Newborn Care, Sexually Trans-<lb/>mitted Infections, Malaria, Tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS [20]. <lb/>Sampling technique and sample size <lb/>The TSPA survey was a sample survey of all formal-sector health facilities in Tanzania. A mas-<lb/>ter list of health facilities that consisted of 7,102 verified (active) health facilities in Tanzania <lb/>was obtained from the MoHSW in the Tanzania Mainland and the Ministry of Health (MOH) <lb/>in Zanzibar. The list included hospitals, health centers, dispensaries, and clinics. These facili-<lb/>ties were managed by the government, private-for-profit, parastatal, and faith-based entities. <lb/>This survey used four main types of data collection tools; Facility inventory questionnaire, <lb/>Health Provider Interview questionnaire, Observation Protocols ANC, FP, and services for <lb/>sick children, and Exit Interview questionnaires for ANC and FP clients and for caretakers of <lb/>sick children whose consultations were observed. The TSPA survey designers randomly <lb/>selected a total of 1200 facilities for inclusion in the survey. This sample was designed to pro-<lb/>vide nationally-representative results according to the type of facility, managing authority, and <lb/>regions for both Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar [20]. <lb/>For the purpose of the current study, we analyzed data from Facility inventory file, there-<lb/>fore, the unit of analysis remained at the facility level. The main inclusion criteria were; the <lb/>health facility must have agreed to participate in the survey, being opened during the day of <lb/>the interview, and providing CRDs services. Out of 1200 facilities, the following were excluded <lb/>because of not meeting the inclusion criteria; seven refused to participate, four were closed on <lb/>the day of the survey, 465 were not providing CRDs services. Therefore, only 723 health facili-<lb/>ties were included in the current analysis, Fig 1. <lb/></body>

			<body>Definition of research terms <lb/>Readiness. In this study is defined as &quot;the capacity of the health facility to provide outpa-<lb/>tient care for chronic respiratory diseases&quot;. The facility was considered to have &quot;high readiness&quot; <lb/>if they scored at least a half (�50%) of the indicators in each of the three domains suggested by <lb/>World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (WHO-SARA) ref-<lb/>erence manual. The domains were; staff training and guideline, equipment (peak flowmeter, <lb/>spacer devices, stethoscopes, and oxygen cylinders), and basic medicines (injectable epineph-<lb/>rine, hydrocortisone tablets, prednisolone tablets, salbutamol, and beclomethasone inhalers). <lb/>Otherwise, the facility was considered to have &quot;low readiness&quot; if they scored less than half <lb/>(&lt;50%) of the aforementioned indicators in each of the three domains. <lb/>Chronic respiratory diseases services. In this study is defined as &quot;the ability of the facility <lb/>to provide diagnosis and/or management of chronic respiratory diseases&quot;. <lb/>Measurement of variables <lb/>Outcome variable. The outcome variable in this study was &quot;readiness&quot; of the health facili-<lb/>ties. The readiness variable was rated as an index categorized into three domains as suggested <lb/>Fig 1.

			<body>by the WHO-SARA reference manual [21]. The first domain was staff and guidelines which <lb/>had two indicators; the presence of a guideline for the management of CRDs and at least one <lb/>staff who received a refresher training to manage CRDs. The facilities with guidelines were cat-<lb/>egorized as &quot;Yes&quot; while those without such guidelines were categorized as &quot;No.&quot; similarly, <lb/>facilities with at least one staff member that had received refresher training in CRDs within 24 <lb/>months were categorized as &quot;Yes,&quot; otherwise were categorized as &quot;No&quot;. The second domain <lb/>was equipment which had four indicators; the peak flow meter, spacer devices, stethoscopes, <lb/>and oxygen cylinders. Each equipment indicator was categorized as &quot;Yes&quot; for facilities that had <lb/>reported the presence of such an indicator and &quot;No&quot; for facilities reported the absence of such <lb/>an indicator. The third domain was a basic medicine which had five indicators: the availability <lb/>injectable epinephrine, hydrocortisone and prednisolone tablets, salbutamol, and beclometha-<lb/>sone inhalers. Each medicine was categorized as &quot;Yes&quot; for facilities that had reported the avail-<lb/>ability of that indicator and &quot;No&quot; for facilities that had reported the absence of such an <lb/>indicator. The responses were aggregated into an index score to calculate a composite score as <lb/>per the WHO-SARA reference manual [21]. The index score was calculated by adding the <lb/>presence of each indicator, with equal weight given to each of the domains and each of the <lb/>indicators within the domains. Since the target was 100%, each domain accounted for 33.3% <lb/>(100%/3) of the index. The percent for each indicator within the domain was equal to 33.3% <lb/>divided by the number of indicators within that domain. Then, the facility that scores at least <lb/>half (equivalent to the median value of 16.7% and above) in each domain and adding up to the <lb/>overall of 50% or more were considered to have &quot;high readiness&quot; for the outpatient manage-<lb/>ment of CRDs while those with less than 50% were considered to have &quot;low readiness.&quot; The <lb/>cut-off point used in this study was also used elsewhere to dichotomize the outcome variable <lb/>[19,22-24]. <lb/>Explanatory variables. The facility type was categorized as &quot;hospital,&quot; &quot;health center,&quot; <lb/>and &quot;clinic/dispensary&quot;; location was categorized as &quot;mainland&quot; and &quot;Zanzibar&quot;; residence was <lb/>categorized as &quot;urban&quot; and &quot;rural&quot;; managing authority was categorized as &quot;public&quot; and &quot;pri-<lb/>vate&quot;; routine management meetings were categorized as &quot;performed&quot; for facilities conducting <lb/>routine management meetings and &quot;not performed&quot; for facilities that reported not having rou-<lb/>tine management meetings; external supervision was categorized as &quot;received&quot; for facilities <lb/>that reported that had received external supervision and &quot;not received&quot; for facilities that <lb/>reported had not received external supervision; external source of revenue was categorized as <lb/>&quot;none,&quot; &quot;government&quot; and &quot;none government&quot;; CRDs guideline was categorized as &quot;available&quot; <lb/>for facilities that had reported the availability of any type of NCDs guideline otherwise were <lb/>categorized as &quot;not available&quot;; user fees was categorized as &quot;fixed for all services&quot; for facilities <lb/>that reported to have a fixed cost for all types of services the patients would receive otherwise <lb/>were categorized as &quot;separate&quot;; training about NCD was categorized as &quot;available&quot; for facility <lb/>that reported to have at least one staff member who had received training in NCDs, otherwise <lb/>were categorized as &quot;not available&quot;. <lb/>Data processing and analysis <lb/>Data were analyzed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). For all analyses, the &quot;svy&quot; <lb/>set command in Stata was employed to adjust for the complex sampling design used in the <lb/>TSPA survey. All estimates were weighted to correct for non-responses and disproportionate <lb/>sampling. In the descriptive analysis, the categorical variables were summarized using fre-<lb/>quency and proportions and then presented either in tables or graphs when appropriate. An <lb/>unadjusted logistic regression model was fitted to assess whether the is an association between <lb/>the outcome variable &quot;readiness&quot; and the explanatory (health facility) variables; location, <lb/></body>

			<body>residence, facility type, managing authority, management meeting, external supervision, an <lb/>external source of revenue, type of user fees and acceptability of health insurance. Thereafter, <lb/>all explanatory variables that showed association with a P value &lt; 0.2 were fitted into the mul-<lb/>tivariable logistic regression model using the stepwise (backward elimination) method to test <lb/>for the association of each variable with the outcome variable. In addition, we disaggregated <lb/>the outcome variable into three predetermined domains (staff and guidelines, diagnostic and <lb/>equipment, and essential medicines) and then fitted three multivariable logistic regression <lb/>models to identify separate factors for each domain. However, in this study, we presented and <lb/>discussed only the results of composite outcome variable &quot;readiness.&quot; The separate models are <lb/>summarized in S1 Table. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <lb/>The generalized variance inflation factor (VIF) was performed to test for the multicollinearity, <lb/>which usually should not exceed 4.0. In the current analysis, no any of the variable included in <lb/>the model presented with VIF&gt;2.0, thus suggesting no any doubts for multicollinearity. The <lb/>resulting final model included all the variables that determine the &quot;readiness&quot; of the facility to <lb/>provide CRDs services. The P-value and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio <lb/>(OR) were used to ascertain the significance of the associations. <lb/>Ethical considerations <lb/>This study was based on an analysis of existing public domain survey datasets that are freely <lb/>available online with all identifier information detached. The original TSPA survey was <lb/>approved by Tanzania&apos;s National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), the Zanzibar Medi-<lb/>cal Ethics and Research Committee (ZAMREC) and the Institutional Review Board of ICF <lb/>International in the USA. The informed consent was requested and obtained from the man-<lb/>ager, the person-in-charge of the facility, or the most senior health worker responsible for cli-<lb/>ent services who was present at the facility. All relevant aspects of the study, including its aim <lb/>and interview procedures were explained clearly to the respondents before interviews. Those <lb/>respondents agreed their facilities to participate in the study, provided a signed written <lb/>informed consent. <lb/>Results <lb/>Distribution characteristics of health facilities <lb/>Table 1 represents the proportion distribution of the health facilities reported to provide man-<lb/>agement for CRDs according to background characteristics. Of the 723 health facilities, 68.6% <lb/>were public managed, 93.7% belonged to primary health care (clinic, dispensary, and health <lb/>center), 70.9% were located to urban, and 81.2% had routine management meetings con-<lb/>ducted. On the other hand, only 26.0% and 13.0% of health facilities had guidelines and staff <lb/>trained staff for NCDs respectively. <lb/>Availability of important components for management of CRDs <lb/>Fig 2 represents the availability of important components for managing CRDs at health facili-<lb/>ties. Of the 723 health facilities reported to provide management for CRDs, 41.3% had guide-<lb/>lines, 8.3% at least one trained staff, 1.9% equipment, and 2.7% basic medicines for the <lb/>management of CRDs. If an individual component is considered separately; for basic medi-<lb/>cines component, 64.1% and 47.1% of health facilities had injectable epinephrine and hydro-<lb/>cortisone respectively while only 18.6% of the health facilities had inhaled salbutamol <lb/>available.

			<body>Factors associated with readiness to provide management of CRDs <lb/>Table 2 represents the logistic regression of the factors associated with facility readiness to pro-<lb/>vide management for CRDs. In adjusted model the following factors were significantly associ-<lb/>ated with likelihood of health facility having high readiness to provide management for CRDs; <lb/>private owned facilities [AOR = 3.3, 95% CI; 1.5-7.5], facility level (health centres [OR = 5.0, <lb/>95% CI; 2.4-10.7], hospitals [OR = 11.6, 95% CI; 5.0-27.2]), and having routine management <lb/>meetings [AOR = 3.3, 95% CI; 1.4-7.8]. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this article, we examined the availability of services and level of health facilities readiness to <lb/>provide management for CRDs and its associated factors in Tanzania. Our study revealed the <lb/>unsatisfactory proportion of Tanzanian health facilities with a high level of readiness to pro-<lb/>vide management for CRDs. In addition, it found that privately owned facilities, high-level <lb/>facilities (hospitals and health centers), and performance of routine management meetings <lb/>were significantly associated with a high readiness to provide management for CRDs. <lb/>The WHO strategy for prevention and control of CRDs recommends provision of refresher <lb/>training to healthcare providers and ensure availability, accessibility, and affordability of <lb/>guideline, diagnostics equipment, and basic medicines for the management of CRDs [1,25,26]. <lb/>However, the current study found the low proportion of health facilities with the availability of <lb/>Table 2.

Given the existing <lb/>epidemiological risks and burden of CRDs in Tanzania context, there is an urgent need to <lb/>address the availability of important components in all health facilities across the country <lb/>regardless of facility type and managing authority. Otherwise, this may lead to under-recogni-<lb/>tion, under-diagnosis, and under-treatment of CRDs hence fueling the epidemic of NCD in <lb/>Tanzania. <lb/>The current study found that private owned facilities and high-level facilities (health centers <lb/>and hospitals) were more likely to have a high readiness to provide management for CRDs <lb/>compared to publicly owned facilities and lower-level facilities (dispensaries) respectively. The <lb/>observed finding might be explained by the evidence that private owned health facilities in the <lb/>LMIC setting have sustainable healthcare provision in terms of responsibility, accountability, <lb/>and efficiency than publicly owned health facilities [31,32]. Also, might be due to the fact that <lb/>publicly owned facilities have a long process (involving multiple levels of authorization) in <lb/>ordering and procuring of equipment and basic medicines for facility consumption [33,34]. <lb/>This long process may result in the low availability of equipment and medicine, therefore, may <lb/>explain the high proportion of publicly owned facilities to have low readiness for management <lb/>of CRDs. <lb/>Moreover, the current study found that facilities that conducted routine management meet-<lb/>ings were significantly more likely to have a high readiness to provide management for CRDs <lb/>compared to their counterpart. The performance of routine management meetings may have a <lb/>great influence in clinical decision making especially when it is reflected in complex cases sce-<lb/>nario of CRDs. This may motivate the health facility authority to make available of necessary <lb/>components for managing CRDs. The current study finding is comparable to the previous <lb/>study in Tanzania which found that performance of routine management meetings was signifi-<lb/>cantly associated with health facility being prepared to provide management for hypertension <lb/>[19]. Therefore, the current findings suggest that routine management meetings may an inde-<lb/>pendent factor that can influence the readiness of health facilities to provide management for <lb/>CRDs. <lb/>In addition, facility residence (rural or urban) was found to be the not significant associated <lb/>with the high readiness of the health facility to provide management for CRDs. In Tanzania, <lb/>more than 70% of the population lives in a rural setting which is served mostly by public health <lb/>facilities [10]. Moreover, the risk of CRDs from indoor air pollution due to the use of solid bio-<lb/>mass fuel in a rural setting is high [9]. Hence this study highlights the urgent need to improve <lb/>important infrastructure necessary for health facilities readiness to provide management for <lb/>CRDs. Therefore, the government should strive to improve the availability of components for <lb/>management of CRDs in particular to the public health facilities which serve the majority of <lb/>the population. <lb/>The significance of the current study relies on the unique epidemiology of CRDs in Tanza-<lb/>nia [11,12,14] and other countries in SSA [7,8,35]. Besides tobacco smoking which is prevalent <lb/>among male population [36,37] the other important potential risks for CRDs have been indoor <lb/>air pollution from a high level of biomass fuel use [8-10], a respiratory infectious disease in <lb/>particular pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumonia. Post pulmonary tuberculosis treat-<lb/>ment sequelae include bronchiectasis and fibro-thorax which are the components of CRDs <lb/>[26,38,39]. The association between CRDs and biomass fuels and tuberculosis have been <lb/>reported in Tanzania [11] and other African countries [7,40]. Therefore, the epidemiology of <lb/>CRDs in Tanzania is of its own uniqueness in the shadow of infectious diseases and solid <lb/></body>

			<body>biomass fuel use. Given this circumstance, it is of paramount importance to have service avail-<lb/>able for management of CRDs in all health facilities in the Tanzania context. <lb/>The current study has the following strengths; it is the first study to assess the readiness of <lb/>the health facilities in Tanzania to provide management for CRDS. The study used a nationally <lb/>representative sample in which our findings reflect the actual situation of the health facilities <lb/>regarding management of CRDs. However, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits its <lb/>utility to explain the relative proportion and temporal relation of all the causative factors to the <lb/>burden of CRDs. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the <lb/>current study did not assess the availability of other important components for management <lb/>of CRDs such as diagnostic spirometry and nebulizer machines; this might have changed the <lb/>obtained results. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Majority of Tanzanian health facilities have low readiness to provide management for chronic <lb/>respiratory diseases. Privately owned facilities, higher-level facilities (hospitals and health cen-<lb/>ters), and performance of routine management meetings were significantly associated with <lb/>high readiness to provide management for CRDs. There is a need for the Tanzanian govern-<lb/>ment to increase the availability of diagnostic equipment, medication, and to provide refresher <lb/>training specifically in the lower-level and public health facilities for better management of <lb/>CRDs and other non-communicable diseases. <lb/></body>
