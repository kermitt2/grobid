			<body>Background &amp; Summary <lb/>Climate change poses a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of alpine ecosystems by altering plant, <lb/>animal and microbial distributions 1,2 , community composition 3 , and food webs 4 ; as well as affecting biotic inter-<lb/>actions between organisms and functional groups 5-8 . These impacts operate through both direct and indirect <lb/>pathways. Individual organism&apos;s physiological rates such as photosynthesis and respiration are directly regu-<lb/>lated by climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation 9,10 . In turn, these impacts will aggregate to affect <lb/>ecosystem-level processes such as productivity, decomposition, and carbon and nutrient fluxes in response <lb/>to climate change 11,12 . Because biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are linked through biotic interactions <lb/>within and among trophic levels and functional groups 5,13 , indirect impacts of climate, operating on and via <lb/>these interactions, are also of critical importance. Disentangling the direct and indirect consequences of climate <lb/>on ecosystems is key to understanding and predicting the full spectrum of biodiversity and functional responses <lb/>to a changing climate. <lb/>Plants are key players in ecosystems: they make up the majority of terrestrial biomass globally, are the main <lb/>source of photosynthetically fixed carbon, and serve as habitat, food sources, and hosts for other organismal <lb/></body>

			<body>groups, while also competing with them for resources 13-15 . A changing climate will drive predictable shifts in <lb/>plant species composition; warmer and wetter climates generally favour taller plants, more resource-acquisitive <lb/>traits, and species that are better competitors for light and nutrients 16 . Previous experiments and observational <lb/>studies from arctic and alpine systems show that plant functional groups encapsulate much of this variation, and <lb/>also respond differently to climate and climate change, with graminoids and shrubs typically increasing 17-19 , and <lb/>bryophytes and lichens decreasing in response to warming 17,18,20,21 . These shifts have knock-on effects on ecosys-<lb/>tem productivity, moisture availability, mineralization, and decomposition processes 22,23 . <lb/>Removal experiments are a &apos;gold standard&apos; approach for disentangling the roles, interactions, and effects of <lb/>co-occurring (groups of) plants (see 13,24 ). Here we report on a fully factorial removal experiment to assess the roles <lb/>of and interactions between the major different plant functional groups in alpine grasslands -graminoids, forbs, and <lb/>bryophytes -in controlling alpine biodiversity, microclimate, and ecosystem functioning. Our semi-natural alpine <lb/>grassland study system is of high biodiversity and conservation value 25 , yet structurally simple and fine-scaled enough <lb/>to allow whole-ecosystem (plants and soil community) experimental manipulation. Our experiment was replicated <lb/>across broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in Western Norway in a &apos;climate grid&apos; design that allows <lb/>disentangling effects of temperature and precipitation change. This is useful, as temperature and precipitation are <lb/>often confounded, both along elevational gradients and in warming experiments (changes in moisture availability <lb/>are a side-effect of standard experimental warming approaches, see 26 ). We use this study design to disentangle the <lb/>direct and indirect effects of climate on plant taxonomic and functional diversity, microclimate, and carbon dynamics <lb/>of alpine grasslands by comparing treatments with plant functional groups removed (direct effects of climate) with <lb/>treatments with one or more functional groups present (net of direct and indirect climate effects) across sites. <lb/>Our experiment is replicated across a macroecological context of twelve calcareous semi-natural grassland <lb/>sites in south-western Norway (Fig. 1a). The fjords of western Norway offer large variation in temperature and <lb/>precipitation, and we used this variability to select sites in a &apos;climate grid&apos; where three temperature levels are <lb/>crossed with four precipitation levels (Fig. 1b). The Vestland Climate Grid (VCG), was established in 2008, and <lb/>a host of biotic and abiotic data are available from previous research, as detailed below. Within each VCG site, <lb/>we established the FunCaB plant functional group removal experiment from which we measured carbon and <lb/>biodiversity responses over 7 years (Fig. 1c). Below, we first describe the site selection and provide basic site <lb/>information, then outline the experimental design and setup, before we detail variables related to (i) functional <lb/>group biomass and the removal treatments, (ii) species-level biomass, (iii-iv) soil microclimate, (v) plant com-<lb/>munity composition, (vi) seedling recruitment, (vii) ecosystem carbon fluxes, and (viii) ecosystem reflectance <lb/>(Table 1). Note that these data vary in spatial and temporal coverage, as described below. We provide raw and <lb/>clean datasets with consistent structure and variable naming 27 , and associated code for cleaning and combining <lb/>data 28 . By documenting and communicating data structures and qualities we aim to facilitate data reuse and <lb/>combination for new applications in the future. <lb/>Fig. 1 Study area, site selection, experimental design, and field sampling overview for the FunCaB plant <lb/>functional group experiment. (a) Location of the study area and the 12 study sites in Vestland county, <lb/>Western Norway. (b) The Vestland Climate Grid is established across independent broad-scale biogeographic <lb/>gradients in summer temperature (mean of four warmest months, °C), and annual precipitation (mean annual <lb/>precipitation, mm). Temperature levels are given as boreal, sub-alpine, and alpine; precipitation levels range <lb/>from 1 (dry) to 4 (wet).

			<body>Methods <lb/>Data management and workflows. We adopt best-practice approaches for open and reproducible <lb/>research planning, execution, reporting, and management throughout the project (see e.g. 29-32 ). Specifically, we <lb/>use community-approved standards for experimental design and data collection 29 , and clean and manage the data <lb/>using a fully scripted and reproducible data workflow, with data and code deposited at open repositories (Fig. 2). <lb/>Research site selection and basic information, and general study setup. Site selection. Our study <lb/>is conducted across the twelve calcareous grassland experimental sites in the Vestland Climate Grid (VCG), in <lb/>south-western Norway (Fig. 1a). The VCG sites were chosen to fit within a climate grid reflecting a fully factorial <lb/>design encompassing the major bioclimatic variation in Norway. Potential sites were identified using a combi-<lb/>nation of topographic maps, geological maps (NGU) and interpolated maps of summer temperature and annual <lb/>precipitation using the 1960-1990 climate normal (100 m resolution gridded data, met.no; see 33 and references <lb/>therein). The three temperature levels (alpine, sub-alpine, boreal) and four levels of precipitation in the climate <lb/>grid (Fig. 1b) were selected to reflect a difference in mean growing season temperature of ca. 2 °C between three <lb/>temperature levels (alpine = 6.5 °C, sub-alpine = 8.5 °C, boreal = 10.5 °C mean temperature of the four warmest <lb/>months of the year) and a difference in mean annual precipitation of 700 mm between four precipitation levels <lb/>(precipitation levels 1 -4 representing 700 mm, 1400 mm, 2100 mm, and 2800 mm, respectively). Climate data <lb/>for the site selection was based on 100-m resolution downscaled data using the 1960-1990 climate normal from <lb/>met.no. The final sites were selected from approximately 200 potential sites visited and surveyed in the sum-<lb/>mer of 2008, with selection criteria set to ensure that other factors such as grazing regime and history, bedrock, <lb/>vegetation type and structure, slope and exposure were kept as constant as possible among the selected sites 34 . <lb/>Geographical distance between sites is on average 15 km and ranges from 175 km to 650 m. <lb/>Dataset <lb/>Response variable <lb/>Number of observations <lb/>Temporal range <lb/>Citation information for raw <lb/>data, clean data, and code <lb/>i <lb/>Functional group removal <lb/>5,412 <lb/>2015 -2021 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>ii <lb/>Species-level biomass <lb/>360 <lb/>2016 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>iii <lb/>Soil temperature <lb/>1,084,970 <lb/>2015 -2016 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>iv <lb/>Soil moisture <lb/>4,771 <lb/>2015 -2019 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>v <lb/>Plant community composition <lb/>plant records: 17,181; plant <lb/>taxa: 206 <lb/>2015 -2019 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>vi <lb/>Seedling recruitment <lb/>16,656 <lb/>2018 -2019 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>vii <lb/>Ecosystem carbon fluxes <lb/>3,696 <lb/>2015 -2017 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/>viii <lb/>Reflectance <lb/>1,244 <lb/>2019, 2021 <lb/>Raw data 27 , clean data 27 , code 28 <lb/> Table 1.

			<body>Study system and experimental area selection within sites. At each site, we selected an experimental area of ca. <lb/>75 -200 m 2 , targeting a homogeneous and representative part of the target grassland vegetation at large at that <lb/>site. The experimental areas were placed on southerly-facing slopes, avoiding depressions and concave areas <lb/>in the landscape and other features such as big rocks or formations that may affect light conditions, hydrol-<lb/>ogy and/or snowdrift. The target vegetation type was forb-rich semi-natural upland grassland vegetation 34,35 , <lb/>within the plant sociological association Potentillo-Festucetum ovinae tending towards Potentillo-Poligonium <lb/>vivipara in the alpine sites and Nardo-Agrostion tenuis in some lowland sites 36 . The most common vascular <lb/>plants across sites, based on sum of covers, are the graminoids Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Avenella flex-<lb/>uosa, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Nardus stricta and the forbs Leucantemum vulgare, Hypericum macula-<lb/>tum, Silene acaulis, Alchemilla alpina, and Lotus corniculatus. Common bryophytes are Pleurotium schreberi, <lb/>Hylocomium splendens, Polythricum spp, Racomitrium lanuginosum, R. fasciculare, and Dicranum spp. All sites <lb/>were moderately grazed prior to the study by sheep, cattle, goats, reindeer, deer, moose, and/or horses; and the <lb/>experimental areas were fenced for the duration of the study to prevent animal and human disturbance of the <lb/>experimental infrastructure. The fenced area was lightly mowed at the end of each growing season to mimic <lb/>past grazing pressure and minimize fence effects. For further description of the sites, see 34 and for access to and <lb/>further description of site-level data, see 35 . <lb/>Block and experimental plot setup. Within these study areas we established four blocks, with a distance between <lb/>the blocks ranging from one up to (in rare cases) 50 meters. Blocks were selectively placed in homogenous <lb/>grassland vegetation, avoiding rocks, depressions, and other features as described above. Each block accom-<lb/>modates eight 25 × 25 cm plots, with at least 25 cm between adjacent plots. If a plot contained more than 10% <lb/>bare rock, shrubs, or other non-grassland features, they were rejected or moved slightly to avoid these features. <lb/>The plots were permanently marked with four aluminium 10-cm long pipes in the soil in the outer corners <lb/>of all the 25 × 25 cm treatment plots, ensuring the pipes to fit the corners of a standardized vegetation anal-<lb/>ysis frame (aluminium frame demarking a 25 × 25 cm inner area, with poles fixed in the corners that fit into <lb/>the aluminium tubes used for plot demarcation in the field). The upslope left corner tube was marked with a <lb/>colour-coded waterproof tape. Note that in 31 out of 48 cases (12 sites × 4 blocks), the blocks were located within <lb/>larger experimental blocks in the VCG sites, and control plots and various block-level data are then shared with <lb/>other experiments in these larger blocks. Linking keys are described in the FunCaB data dictionaries below (see <lb/>Fig. 3 and data records iii-vii below). For some datasets, additional plots within blocks were needed.

			<body>Background abiotic and biotic data from the Vestland Climate Grid. The Vestland Climate Grid <lb/>field sites were established in 2008, and from a series of research projects within the grid over the years we have <lb/>collected a broad range of datasets on the climate and environment, soils, land-use and environment, vegetation, <lb/>and ecosystems, along with basic descriptive data of the 12 sites, as described in 34 . All these datasets are available <lb/>from the previous projects through the VCG OSF (Open Science Framework) repository 35 , and the results are <lb/>presented in associated papers, see for example 34,37-45 . The overall data structure, and the most relevant datasets <lb/>from the VCG for the FunCaB project is laid out in Fig. 3, and briefly described below. Code to download and <lb/>link these data to the FunCaB experimental data and sites are provided in the FunCaB github repository 28 (see R/ <lb/>download_VCG_data). <lb/>A new research project, &apos;FUNDER -Direct and indirect climate impacts on the biodiversity and FUNctioning <lb/>of the UNDERground ecosystem&apos; funded by the Norwegian Research Council KLIMAFORSK programme (pro-<lb/>ject number 315249, 2021 -2025) will augment the FunCaB experiment with data on the belowground compo-<lb/>nents of the plant-soil ecosystem, including roots, mesofauna, fungi and microbes. These upcoming data will all <lb/>link with the FunCaB and VCG project based on the given experimental, site and organismal keys, as indicated <lb/>in Fig. 3. <lb/>VCG Basic site-level attributes. Basic descriptive data on the 12 sites include latitude, longitude, elevation, <lb/>geology, land-use, soils, and their position within the climate grid (precipitation and temperature levels). These <lb/>data are described in 34,40 , provided in 35 , and can be downloaded using 28 (see R/download_VCG_data). For con-<lb/>venience, the climate grid information is also provided in the biomass dataset (see below). <lb/>VCG Site-level climate data. Temperature was measured continuously at each of the 12 VCG sites at four <lb/>heights (2 m and 30 cm above ground, at ground level, and 5 cm below ground), soil moisture was measured <lb/>continuously with two replicate loggers ca. 5 cm below ground, and precipitation was measured at each site dur-<lb/>ing the snow-free season. For these measurements, we used Delta T GP1 loggers (Delta T devices, Cambridge, <lb/>UK) equipped with two temperature probes, two SM200 moisture sensors which were later replaced as necessary <lb/>with SM300 and SM150T loggers, and an ARG 100 tipping bucket (EML LTD, North Shields, UK) from 2009 <lb/>onwards. UTL-3 version 3.0 temperature loggers (GEOTEST AG, Zollikofen, Switzerland) were used for meas-<lb/>uring the 2 m and 30 cm temperatures. Soil moisture was measured as the mean of four measurements taken <lb/>along each side of the turf, several times during the growing season using a Delta T HH2 version 2.3 Moisture <lb/>Meter with the same probes as for the GP1 logger (SM200, SM150T). These data are described in 34,40 , provided <lb/>in 35 , and can be downloaded using 28 (see folder R/download_VCG_data). <lb/>VCG Soil chemical and structural data. Over the years, various soil chemical variables have been measured at <lb/>the block level within each of the 12 VCG sites, including soil pH (2009) and % Loss-On-Ignition (2009, 2013), <lb/>and available N, as sum of N available as NH4-N and NO 3 -N (available N per deployment period, 2010 &amp; 2012). <lb/>Soil pH was measured after adding 50 ml distilled water to 25 g soil and mixing for two hours. Loss-on-ignition <lb/>(LOI), was measured by weighing dry soil (105 °C for 24, one hour in a desiccator), and burnt soil (six hours <lb/>at 550 °C, one hour in the desiccator) and calculating LOI as the (burnt soil mass/dry soil mass) × 100. NH4-N <lb/>and NO 3 -N were measured using in-situ ion exchange resin bags (IERBs) were used to measure the amount of <lb/>plant-available nutrients in the soil. These data are partially described in 34,40 , and the full data are provided in 35 . <lb/>VCG Litter decomposition data. Decomposition has been assessed at each of the 12 VCG sites using local plant <lb/>litter and the Tea Bag Index method (Keuskamp et al., 2013). Local litter (dead leaves detached from live plants) <lb/>was collected at each site in 2013 or 2014, with the specific timing of the collections at each site tuned to ensure that <lb/>litter was present, not covered by snow, and not decomposed. In practice, this necessitated litter collection after <lb/>snowmelt in spring in many sites. The litter was washed, dried, and stored in dark, dry, cool conditions.

			<body>five replicate litter bags containing 1 g of graminoid litter were buried at each site, and collected at four points in <lb/>time after burial (1, 2, 3 and 12 months). Harvested litter bags were cleaned (soil and roots removed), dried for 48 h <lb/>at 60 °C and weighed. The Tea Bag Index method 46 was used in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to measure decomposition at <lb/>all sites of the climate grid. At each site, 10 replicates of each tea type were buried pair-wise, 8 cm below ground and <lb/>with at least 10 cm between the tea bags. For a couple of sites, the number of replicate tea bag pairs was higher in <lb/>2015 (12 replicates at the site Gudmedalen and 16 replicates at Låvisdalen). After collection, adhering soil particles <lb/>and roots were removed and the tea bags were dried (48 h at 60 °C) and weighed.

In 2016 and 2017, we measured 11 leaf functional traits that are related to <lb/>potential physiological growth rates and environmental tolerance of plants, following the standardized protocols <lb/>in Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 51 : leaf area (LA, cm 2 ), leaf thickness (LT, mm), leaf dry matter content (LDMC, g/g), <lb/>specific leaf area (SLA, cm 2 /g), carbon (C, %), nitrogen (N, %), phosphorus (P, %), carbon nitrogen ratio (C:N), <lb/>nitrogen phosphorus ratio (N:P), carbon13 isotope ratio (δ13C, ‰), and nitrogen15 isotope ratio (δ15N, ‰). <lb/>Trait data are available at the site level for species making up at least 80% of the vegetation cover in the control <lb/>plots at each of the 12 VCG sites. The plants were collected outside of the experimental plots and within a 50 m <lb/>perimeter from the blocks, and we aimed to collect up to five individuals from each species in each site. To avoid <lb/>repeated sampling from a single clone, we selected individuals that were visibly separated from other ramets of <lb/>that species. The sampled plant individuals were labelled, put in plastic bags with moist paper towels, and stored <lb/>in darkness at 4 °C until processing, which was done as soon as possible and always within 4 days. These data are <lb/>described in 52 , provided in 35 , and can be downloaded using 28 (see folder R/download_VCG_data). <lb/> Experimental design. The functional group removal experiment was designed to examine the impact of <lb/>aboveground interactions among the major plant functional groups -graminoids, forbs and bryophytes -on <lb/>the performance and functioning of other components of the vegetation and ecosystem. The experiment con-<lb/>sists of eight 25 × 25 cm plots per site and block, with a fully factorial combination of removals of three plant <lb/>functional groups, with treatments randomized within each block. The general experimental design, with the <lb/>different removal treatments detailed, are provided as an insert to the timeline in Fig. 1c. The functional groups <lb/>are delineated and abbreviated in the various datasets as follows: G = graminoids (including grasses, sedges and <lb/>rushes), F = forbs (including herbaceous forbs, pteridophytes, dwarf-shrubs, and small individuals of trees and <lb/>shrubs), B = Bryophytes (including mosses, liverworts, and hornworts). Note that all species are also coded by <lb/>their respective functional group into which they were classified in the FunCaB taxon table. The experimental <lb/>treatments are coded by functional group removed so that FGB = bare-ground gaps with all plants removed, <lb/>FB = only graminoids remaining, GB = only forbs remaining, GF = only bryophytes remaining, B = graminoids <lb/>and forbs remaining, F = bryophytes and graminoids remaining, G = bryophytes and forbs remaining, and <lb/>C = intact vegetation controls with no vegetation removed. In 2016, four extra control (XC) plots were marked <lb/>per site for aboveground biomass harvest and ecosystem carbon flux measurements. This sampling regime gave a <lb/>total of 384 plots in the core FunCaB experiment, plus the additional 48 controls in 2016. <lb/>Functional group removals were done once in 2015 (at peak growing season due to late snowmelt), twice per <lb/>year in 2016 and 2017 (after the spring growth and at peak growing season) and annually from 2018 to 2021 (at <lb/>Variable name Description <lb/>Variable type Variable range or levels <lb/>Units <lb/>How <lb/>measured <lb/>year <lb/>Year of sampling <lb/>numeric <lb/>2015 -2016 <lb/>yyyy <lb/>defined <lb/>date_time <lb/>Date and time of sampling (UTC + 2) <lb/>date_time <lb/>2015-07-12 17:58:01 -<lb/>2016-06-27 23:05:01 <lb/>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss defined <lb/>siteID <lb/>Unique site ID <lb/>categorical <lb/>Alrust -Vikesland <lb/>defined <lb/>blockID <lb/>Unique block ID a combination of site and block categorical <lb/>Alr1 -Vik5 <lb/>defined <lb/>plotID <lb/>Unique plot ID is a combination of site, block and <lb/>treatment <lb/>categorical <lb/>Alr1B -Vik5GF <lb/>defined <lb/>iButtonID <lb/>Unique iButton ID <lb/>categorical <lb/>003E3B5C41_2016 -<lb/>F83E3E2A41_2016 <lb/>defined <lb/>treatment <lb/>Plant functional groups removed, where <lb/>F = forbs, G = graminoids, B = bryophytes, and <lb/>C = control <lb/>categorical <lb/>FGB, FG, FB, GB, G, <lb/>F, B, C <lb/>defined <lb/>soiltemperature Soil temperature measurement per plot <lb/>numeric <lb/>−8.75 -32.8 <lb/>°C <lb/>recorded <lb/>comments <lb/>Additional comments <lb/>categorical <lb/>turfID <lb/>Unique turf ID from SeedClim transplant <lb/>experiment <lb/>categorical <lb/>101 TTC -73 TTC <lb/>defined <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>peak growing season) as regrowth had declined (see below) and biannual removals were no longer necessary. <lb/>At each sampling, all above-ground biomass of the relevant plant functional group was removed from each plot <lb/>as follows: for each plot, all the above-ground parts of the relevant functional group(s) were removed using <lb/>scissors and tweezers to cut the plants at the ground layer (i.e., the soil-vegetation interface). Roots and other <lb/>below-ground parts were not removed, and non-target plant functional groups and litter were left intact. <lb/>Species identification, taxonomy, and flora. All vascular plant species were identified to the species <lb/>level in the field, with nomenclature following Lid and Lid 53 . Exceptions are sterile specimens of species that <lb/>are not possible to identify without reproductive parts, and where flowers are either too rare or individuals too <lb/>short-lived for comparisons of the position of individuals within the plots over years to be used to ascertain <lb/>identifications (For example, Alchemilla spp. excluding A. alpina, and the annual Euphrasia spp.). Species iden-<lb/>tifications were confirmed by comparing records over time as described below. All unidentified specimens are <lb/>included and flagged in the dataset, as described in Data Records below. The full taxon names are provided in the <lb/>taxon table on OSF (Fig. 3). <lb/>Dataset collection methods. Datasets (i-ii): Biomass and functional group removal. As described above, <lb/>functional group removals were done once in 2015 at peak growing season, and twice per year in 2016 and 2017 <lb/>(after the spring growth; at peak growing season) and annually at peak growing season from 2018 to 2021. For <lb/>each removal plot and occasion, a picture was taken of the plot pre-removal, the biomass to be removed was <lb/>collected in separate pre-marked paper bags for each functional group (graminoids, forbs and bryophytes), and <lb/>a picture was taken post-removal. The collected biomass was then dried at 60 °C for 48 hours and weighed to the <lb/>nearest 0.01 g (Model LPG-1002, VWR). From the four extra control (XC) plots in 2016, total above-ground <lb/>biomass as well as litter (defined as dead biomass detached from live plants, see 28 ) was collected at peak growing <lb/>season. From these plots, biomass was sorted into functional groups as described above, except the forb func-<lb/>tional group, which was sorted into species. The graminoid and bryophyte functional groups, each forb species, <lb/>and litter were individually dried and weighed as described above. The data is available as (i) a biomass dataset, <lb/>consisting of the removed biomass per plot, date, removal treatment, and functional group for all treatment plots, <lb/>and the total biomass per functional group plus litter for the extra control plots in 2016, and (ii) a species-level <lb/>forb biomass dataset from the extra control plots in 2016 (Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Datasets (iii-iv) -Soil microclimate. We measured soil temperature 3-5 cm below the soil surface for each plot <lb/>using iButton temperature sensors (DS1922L, Manufacturer reports temperature accuracy of ±0.5 °C, Maxim <lb/>Integrated INC., San Jose, CA, USA). The data are reported with a resolution of 0.0625 at 140 min intervals from <lb/>June 2015 to July 2016. We measured soil moisture as volumetric soil moisture; expressed as % water volume per <lb/>soil volume ((m 3 water /m 3 soil) × 100). These measurements were done c. 3-5 times during the growing seasons <lb/>from 2015-2019, usually in connection with the flux and vegetation measurements, by taking the average of four <lb/>measurements, one at each side of each plot (SM300, Manufacturer reports accuracy ±2.5% vol over 0 to 50% <lb/>vol and 0-60 °C, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). The data is available as (iii) temperature and (iv) volumetric <lb/>soil moisture % per plot and time point (temperature) or date (moisture) (Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Dataset (v): Vascular plant community composition and vegetation structure. We recorded the full vascular <lb/>plant species composition of all experimental plots in 2015 (pre treatment), and the control plots plus the extra <lb/>control plots in 2016. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, we recorded the community composition in controls and in <lb/>the functional groups that remained in the experimental plots according to the plot&apos;s treatment. At each anal-<lb/>ysis, each plot was sub-divided into 25 5 × 5 cm subplots, using a subplot overlay. We first recorded all species <lb/>of vascular plants in the central five subplots, (i.e., the central + shaped area of each plot, Fig. 1c) noting the <lb/>subplot cover of each species present in each of the five subplots (1 -25% = 1, 26 -50% = 2, 51 -75% = 3, <lb/>&gt;76% = 4).

			<body>Other variables that were measured were percentage cover of bryophytes, litter, bare ground, and rock (meas-<lb/>ured per plot and per subplot) and moss layer depth in mm (mean of 4 measurements/plot), date of analysis, <lb/>recorder/scribe (if any), and free-text comments. These data are available as % cover, depth in mm, date (year. <lb/>month.day) and text strings per subplot and /or plot per sampling date (Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Dataset (vi): Seedling recruitment. The total number of forb seedlings that emerged in the plots was recorded <lb/>in 2018 and 2019. At peak growing season in 2018 (round 1, July-August, depending on site), all dicotyledon-<lb/>ous seedlings were marked with wooden toothpicks and their x and y coordinates in the plot (mm, recorded <lb/>from the bottom left hand-corner of the plot, Fig. 1c) and tentative species identity noted. Toward the end of <lb/>the growing season (round 2, August-September, depending on site), each plot was revisited, seedling survival <lb/>established, and any further seedlings marked. Survival (recorded when a seedling was present in subsequent <lb/>surveys; recorded as mortality if absent) and new seedling emergence were followed up in the same manner <lb/>in 2019 (rounds 3 and 4, respectively). Species identification was (re)assessed at all censuses and corrected if <lb/>needed as the seedlings grew and identification uncertainty decreased. New seedlings were differentiated from <lb/>emergent clonal ramets by looking for cotyledons or signs of above-or below-ground ramet connections. These <lb/>data are available as talleys of seedlings, each with a status (dead or alive) and species identity (or NA when not <lb/>identifiable), per subplot and /or plot per sampling round (Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Dataset (vii): Ecosystem carbon flux data and flux calculations. Carbon flux measurements. Ecosystem CO 2 <lb/>fluxes were measured to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross pri-<lb/>mary production (GPP). The dataset covers the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, and individual plots have multiple <lb/>measurements for ecosystem carbon flux per year as detailed below. At peak growing season in 2015, a median <lb/>of 2 sets of paired carbon flux measurements were measured pre-removal for all plots, where a paired set consist <lb/>of a light and a dark flux measurement of an individual plot. In 2016, a median of 8 sets of paired measurements <lb/>were made for all control plots, and a median of 7 for the 4 extra controls (see experimental design above). In <lb/>the data files, some additional measurements exist for other experiments in the VCG sites (a median of 7 paired <lb/>sets of measurements for controls (TTC) and graminoid removal plots (RTC), see 42 for a presentation of this <lb/>experiment and 35 for technical details).

			<body>and Arhelleren). These measurements were made ca. 1 week after the first round of plant functional group <lb/>removals in that season. <lb/>At each sampling occasion, a clear chamber (25 × 25 × 40 cm) equipped with two fans for air circulation and <lb/>connected to an infrared gas analyzer (Li-840; Manufacturer reports accuracy within 1.5% of the reading value; <lb/>LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to measure CO 2 fluxes at all plots. To prevent cutting of roots <lb/>and disruption of water flow in the plots by installing collars, we instead attached a windshield to the bottom of <lb/>the chamber and weighed it down on the ground by a heavy chain to prevent wind-air mixing. At each sampling <lb/>occasion we made paired measurements of fluxes under light and dark conditions, covering the chamber with a <lb/>fitted light-excluding cover for the dark measurements. <lb/>NEE was estimated from measurements of CO 2 flux under ambient light and dark conditions: <lb/>NEElight = GPP -Reco, NEEdark = (-) Reco. We define NEE such that negative values reflect CO 2 uptake in <lb/>the ecosystem, and positive values reflect CO 2 release from the ecosystem to the atmosphere. For each measure-<lb/>ment, CO 2 concentration was recorded at 5 s intervals over a period of 90-120 s. NEE was calculated from the <lb/>temporal change of CO 2 concentration within the closed chamber according to the following formula: <lb/>NEE <lb/>CO <lb/>t <lb/>PV <lb/>R A <lb/>T <lb/>( <lb/>273 15) <lb/>2 <lb/>δ <lb/>δ <lb/>= <lb/>× <lb/>× × <lb/>+ <lb/>. <lb/>where δ δ <lb/>CO <lb/>t <lb/>2 is the slope of the CO 2 concentration against time (µmol mol −1 s −1 ), P is the atmospheric pressure <lb/>(kPa), R is the gasconstante (8.314 kPa m3 K −1 mol −1 ), T is the air temperature inside the chamber (°C), V is the <lb/>chamber volume (m 3 ) and A is the surface area (m 2 ). <lb/>Light intensity was measured as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, µmol m −2 s −1 ) using a quantum <lb/>sensor (Li-190; Manufacturer reports absolute calibration accuracy of ±5%; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, <lb/>USA) placed inside the chamber. Temperature inside the chamber was measured using an iButton temper-<lb/>ature logger (DS1922L, Manufacturer reports temperature accuracy of ±0.5 °C, Maxim Integrated, San Jose, <lb/>CA, USA). Volumetric soil moisture content (m 3 water/m 3 soil) × 100 was measured by calculating the average <lb/>of four measurements with a soil moisture sensor (SM300, Manufacturer reports moisture accuracy of ±2.5%, <lb/>Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK), taken at each side of a plot. <lb/>Data management and calculations.

All <lb/>measurements were first visually evaluated for quality and only measurements that showed a consistent linear <lb/>relationship between CO 2 over a time for a period of at least 60 s were used for NEE calculations. A second <lb/>inclusion criterion was that this relationship had R 2 ≤ 0.2 or R 2 ≥ 0.8 for NEE measurement in light conditions <lb/>and R 2 ≥ 0.8 for NEE dark measurements (R eco ). Measurements of NEE in light conditions with R 2 ≤ 0.2 ensures <lb/>representation of measurements with equal rates for R eco and GPP. Third, paired measurements that were more <lb/>than 2 h apart were excluded. These data are available as raw fluxes and as GPP and R eco per plot per measurement <lb/>(Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Dataset (vi): Reflectance. Reflectance measures of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were taken <lb/>for each plot during the 2019 (post functional group removal) and 2021 (pre and post removal) field seasons <lb/>(July-August), using a Trimble Greenseeker Handheld Crop Sensor (Trimble Inc., Sunnydale, CA, USA). As <lb/>the sensor measures an elliptical plane, two measures perpendicular to each other were taken for each sub-<lb/>plot (25 × 25 cm plot), with the centre of each ellipse being the centre of the subplot. Care was taken to ensure <lb/>that sampling quadrat frames were not within the sensor range when conducting measurements (see methods <lb/>Dataset ii). Measures of NDVI were taken at 60 cm above the surface where possible. Height was measured <lb/>perpendicular to the sampled ground surface. These data are available as reflectance per plot per sampling date <lb/>(Fig. 3, Table 1). <lb/>Data Records <lb/>This paper reports on data from a plant functional group removal experiment replicated across the twelve sites <lb/>in the Vestland Climate Grid along broad-scale bioclimatic gradients in boreal and alpine grasslands in western <lb/>Norway, conducted from the 2015 growing season onwards.

The reader is referred to the code and the detailed cod-<lb/>ing, data cleaning, and data accuracy comments and the associated raw and cleaned data and metadata tables <lb/>available in these repositories for detailed information about the data cleaning process. Figure 2 and the Usage <lb/>Notes section in this paper summarises the data accuracy and data cleaning procedures, see the latter for caveats <lb/>regarding data quality and our advice on &apos;best practice&apos; data usage. <lb/>Dataset (i): lant functional group removed and total biomass. This dataset contains the biomass <lb/>removed per experimental plot and functional group per year, and the total biomass in the extra controls in 2016 <lb/>(Tables 1, 2, Fig. 4). For convenience, this dataset also contains basic information on the temperature and precipi-<lb/>tation levels in the VCG climate grid (more details available in 35 and 28 ). From the experimental plots we removed <lb/>a total of 17,839 g biomass over the project period; 5,881 g graminoids, 6,039 g forbs, and 5,918 g bryophytes. <lb/>Biomass removed decreased over time, 3,742 g, 6,396 g, 1,956 g, 1,095 g, 1,701 g, 1,502 g, and 1,446 g per year from <lb/>2015 through 2021, suggesting that the removed functional groups were not able to recover from treatments and <lb/>gradually were excluded from the treated plots as the experiment progressed. The lowest biomass was removed <lb/>in 2018, a drought year. <lb/>The extra control plots in 2016 contained a total of 1,495 g total above-ground biomass; 357.0 g grasses, <lb/>300.0 g forbs, 322.0 g bryophytes, 7.9 g lichens, 0.9 g ferns, 1.9 g cryptogams, and 506.0 g litter. This corresponds <lb/>to overall average biomass across the twelve sites of 119.0, 100.0, 107.3 and 168.7 g/m 2 for the three functional <lb/>groups and litter, respectively.

This dataset contains the biomass <lb/>removed per plot and species for forbs in the 48 extra control plots in 2016 (Tables 1, 3). Species-level biomass was <lb/>recorded for 79 forb species, of which Potentilla erecta (24.3 g), Achillea millefolium (16.6 g), and Alchemilla alpina <lb/>(16.3 g) were the most abundant overall. Abundances varied across sites, in the alpine Alchemilla alpina (12.9 g), <lb/>Alchemilla sp. (10.0 g), and Salix herbacea (5.97 g) were the most abundant species, whereas in boreal sites Achillea <lb/>millefolium (10.2 g), Potentilla erecta (6.88 g), and Hieracium pilosella (5.51 g), dominated.

			<body>2015 to 2019, with the median number of measurements per plot per year ranging from 3 -5, except in 2018 <lb/>where the median was one measurement per plot. Average soil moisture was 20.2 ± 0.4% in 2015, 26.1 ± 0.5% <lb/>in 2016, 29.6 ± 0.6% in 2017, 19.0 ± 0.9% in 2018, and 13.7 ± 0.5% in 2019, which was a drought year. Plots with <lb/>forbs only and all functional groups removed were the driest, with an average soil moisture of 21.8 ± 0.7% (F) and <lb/>22.1 ± 0.7 (FGB) whereas the intact control plots were the wettest with 24.1 ± 0.6% (C). For an overview over the <lb/>clean dataset see Table 5. The final cleaned data together with a data dictionary is provided on the FunCaB OSF 27 , <lb/>and the code to download the final cleaned data can be found in the FunCaB GitHub repository 28 in the file R/ <lb/>data_dic/download_clean_data.R. <lb/>Dataset (v): Vascular plant community composition and structure. The plot-level plant commu-<lb/>nity dataset contains a total of 206 taxa and 17,181 observations (taxa × plots × years) (Tables 2, 6). Overall, <lb/>299 observations (1.74%) were not identified to taxon. In 2015, the pre-treatment vegetation had an average <lb/>species richness of 5.9 graminoids (ranging from 3.2 to 9.3 across sites) and 10.8 forbs (ranging from 3.8 to 14.9 <lb/>across sites) per plot. The highest species richness was found in alpine sites. Sum of covers of the non-removed <lb/>functional groups varied over sites and years (Fig. 5). In many cases, biomass of the remaining functional group <lb/>increases over time in plots where other functional groups were removed, relative to controls, suggesting release <lb/>from competitive interactions may be occurring. However, in some cases, notably forbs in colder and wetter sites, <lb/>responses are neutral to negative, which is consistent with earlier work in the system suggesting that competitive <lb/>plant-plant interactions are less important and facilitative interactions more important under these conditions 42 . <lb/>Similarly, there were generally lower abundances and also lower relative biomass gains in removals in 2018, which <lb/>was a drought year, suggesting competitive release was less important under this climate extreme event (Fig. 5). <lb/>Note that some of the recorded data (e.g., sub-plot level presence data, life-history stage/fertility data, acrocarp/ <lb/>pleurocarp bryophyte cover data) are available in the raw data tables, but these are not processed or presented in <lb/>the final data table. For an overview over the clean dataset see Table 6. The final cleaned data together with a data <lb/>dictionary is provided on the FunCaB OSF 27 , and the code to download the final cleaned data and the taxon table <lb/>can be found in the FunCaB GitHub repository 28 in the file R/data_dic/download_clean_data.R. <lb/>Dataset (vi): Seedling recruitment. The seedling recruitment dataset has data on a total of 16,656 seed-<lb/>lings of 44 species (Tables 2, 7). Overall, 61.2% of the seedlings were identified to species, the remaining 38.8% <lb/>were either unidentifiable for the duration of the study or they died before they could be identified. Seedling den-<lb/>sities were highest in the bare soil and forb only plots (FGB and GB treatments) with 1,297 and 1,451 seedlings <lb/>m −2 , respectively, and lowest in the graminoid and bryophyte and graminoid only plots (F and FB treatments) <lb/>with 228 and 224 seedlings m −2 , respectively. The intact vegetation controls (C) had intermediate seedling den-<lb/>sities, with 764 seedlings m −2 . Seedling emergence differed between the two study years, with 5,888 seedlings <lb/>recorded in the drought year 2018 compared to 10,768 in 2019. Overall, 5,870 seedlings survived till the last <lb/>census. For an overview over the clean dataset see Table 7.

The plot-level ecosystem carbon flux dataset has a total of 3,696 <lb/>paired light (GPP) and dark (Reco) measurements between 2015 and 2017 (Tables 1, 8, 9). A total of 926 paired <lb/>fluxes were recorded in 2015, 1,286 in 2016 and 1,484 in 2017. The median number of measurements per plot <lb/>and year 2 in 2015, 8 in 2016 (when we measured control plots only) and 5 in 2017. The GPP values ranged <lb/>from −24.30 ± 0.06 to −0.01 ± 0.06 µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 , the PAR between 4.66 ± 8.46 and 2555.00 ± 8.46 (µmol <lb/>m −2 s −1 ), the soil moisture between 0 ± 0.28 and 76.78 ± 0.28 and the air temperature within the chamber var-<lb/>ied between 6.08 ± 0.10 and 39.63 ± 0.10 °C. The respiration measurements (R eco ) ranged from 0.55 ± 0.05 to <lb/>30.35 ± 0.05 µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 , the soil moisture between 0 ± 0.28 and 76.78 ± 0.28 and the associated air <lb/>temperature varied within the chamber measurements between 6.08 ± 0.10 and 38.83 ± 0.10 °C. Note that light <lb/>and dark measurements have very similar soil moisture and air temperature, as would be expected given that <lb/>they are both measured on the same plots within a short period. Average GPP varied among treatments, and on <lb/>average, the highest CO 2 uptake was found in intact vegetation (C; −8.28 ± 0.19 µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 ) while the <lb/>lowest uptake was found in bare ground plots (FGB treatment; −4.95 ± 0.27 µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 ). Respiration <lb/>did not vary much across treatments, but for GPP, the highest value 6.63 ± 0.15µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 was again <lb/>found in the intact vegetation (C) and the lowest value 5.04 ± 0.17 µmol mol −1 s −1 CO 2 in the bare ground plots <lb/>(FGB treatment). For an overview over the clean dataset see Tables 8, 9. The final cleaned data together with a data <lb/>dictionary is provided on the FunCaB OSF 27 , and the code to download the final cleaned data can be found in the <lb/>FunCaB GitHub repository 28 in the file R/data_dic/download_clean_data.R. <lb/>Dataset (xi) -Reflectance. The plot-level community reflectance dataset has a total of 1,244 observations. <lb/>In 2019 we made 480 post-treatment measurements, and in 2021 we made 382 pre-treatment measurements <lb/>and 382 post-treatment measurements (Tables 2, 10). Average reflectance post-treatment was 0.634 ± 0.004 <lb/>(mean ± SE) in 2019 and 0.679 ± 0.006 in 2021, whereas the reflectance pre-treatment in 2021 was 0.760 ± 0.010. <lb/>In both years, the highest reflectance post cut was found in the intact vegetation (C), 0.695 ± 0.007 in 2019 and <lb/>0.774 ± 0.009 in 2021, whereas the lowest reflectance was found in the bare ground treatment (FGB) 0.524 ± 0.008 <lb/>in 2019 and 0.507 ± 0.015 in 2021. For an overview over the clean dataset see Table 10. The final cleaned data <lb/>together with a data dictionary is provided on the FunCaB OSF 27 , and the code to download the final cleaned data <lb/>can be found in the FunCaB GitHub repository 28 in the file R/data_dic/download_clean_data.R. <lb/>technical Validation <lb/>Experimental validation. The plant functional group experiments and field measurements (before-after <lb/>treatment photographs, soil moisture measurements, site-level VCD climate data) were maintained over seven <lb/>years under the oversight of LCK, supported by IHJA and SAHÖ in some years and field campaigns. Consistent <lb/>leadership of the campaigns ensured consistency in experimental treatments and data collection, which was crit-<lb/>ical as a large number of students, technicians and interns were involved in the plant functional group removal <lb/>work, typically 4 -6 people each year (see Acknowledgements). Errors made during field work are noted in the <lb/>data sheets and entered as comments in the plant functional group removal biomass data tables. The photographs <lb/>of each plot pre-and post-removal for each field campaign (with some gaps, and photos are lacking from 2020) <lb/>can be used for further documentation and validation 27 . Biomass removed decreased over time, especially after <lb/>the second year (Fig. 5, suggesting the communities stabilised in the experimentally defined functional group <lb/>composition, with relatively little regrowth of the removed functional group after this point. <lb/>Taxonomic validation. During the 7-year data collection period a number of people were involved in com-<lb/>munity and seedling data collection (see notes in dataset for recorder information), which introduces a risk of <lb/>observer errors. In particular, species can be misidentified (e.g., sterile graminoids) or might be overlooked in <lb/>one of the community censuses. Such errors, if uncorrected, generate pseudo-turnover in the plant community <lb/>and seedling data. To detect and correct errors in the community data, we compared each recorded species in <lb/>each plot or subplot over the time-series. We used these comparisons to assign unidentified or missing species <lb/>to an existing identified species in that plot if it was likely that this could be the correct ID, and if there was a <lb/>record of that species in the plot in the previous and following year. Further, we imputed species covers in cases <lb/>where cover was either missing or clearly too low or high to be realistic when comparing with the total sum of <lb/>covers and covers of the same species in adjacent years in the time-series, replacing such erroneous values with <lb/>the mean cover from the previous and following year. We further checked and corrected &apos;botanist effects&apos; in cover <lb/>estimation between observers, in height estimations (using cm vs mm), and ensured taxonomic consistency. The <lb/>data-checking code and outcomes for these various procedures is documented in 28 . In addition, 23 forbs and six <lb/>graminoid taxa are identified to the genus level in the community dataset and one graminoid, two forbs and seven <lb/>seedling observations are unidentified (these are named NID.herb, NID.gram, and NID.seedling in the datasets) <lb/>(datasets v, vi). A full species list of all identified taxa across datasets is also available in the taxon table in the <lb/>OSF repository (see Table 2). This table also includes the functional group (F, G, or B) to which each taxon was <lb/>assigned in the experimental treatments. Note that the sub-plot-level presences and life-history stage/fertility data <lb/>are available in the OSF, but these data have not been processed or cleaned. <lb/>Ecosystem C flux validation. All measurements were first visually evaluated for data quality. If there were <lb/>clear outliers (values far outside the normal range of CO 2 concentrations within a measurement), these values <lb/>were flagged and removed before flux calculation. The timeframes of measurements were adjusted if the linear <lb/></body>

			<body>relationship over time was affected by either change in cloud cover or there was indication of chamber leakage <lb/>(CO 2 increase/decrease levelling off after steady linear relationship). Resulting fluxes were only included if they <lb/>showed a consistent linear relationship between CO 2 and time for a period of at least 60 seconds. Measurements <lb/>of poor quality due to erratic CO 2 concentrations over time were flagged and removed. An additional criterion <lb/>was that this relationship had R 2 ≤ 0.2 or R 2 ≥ 0.8 for NEE measurement in light conditions and R 2 ≥ 0.8 for <lb/>NEE dark measurements (R eco ; 52, 150 and 466 measurements removed in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively). <lb/>Measurements of NEE in light conditions with R 2 ≤ 0.2 ensure inclusion of measurements with equal rates for R eco <lb/>and GPP. Dark measurements with resulting NEE &lt; 0 were removed, as they would indicate uptake CO 2 uptake <lb/>(49 measurements removed in 2017). Sets of L and D measurement per plot were then matched together based <lb/>on date and time of day for calculation of GPP but were not paired if they were more than 2 hours apart from each <lb/>other. Finally, GPP fluxes with values &gt; 0 were removed, as they would represent CO 2 release, not uptake/primary <lb/>productivity (0 measurements were thus removed in 2015, 18 in 2016, and 191 in 2017). The PAR sensor for one <lb/>of the chambers was malfunctioning between 03 July 2017 and 6 July 2017. PAR values for these measurements <lb/>were corrected by using an estimated value based on recorded PAR values in the metadata from the other par <lb/>sensor. <lb/>Usage Notes <lb/>Data use best practice.

We note that for plant <lb/>functional group removal biomass (dataset i), soil moisture (dataset iv), plant community (dataset v), carbon flux <lb/>(dataset vii) and reflectance (dataset viii), a final census planned for 2022. These data will be added to 27 and 28 . <lb/>The data presented here relates to a large amount site and block level data from the same sites 35 , the most <lb/>relevant of which are briefly explained under &apos;Background abiotic and biotic data from the Vestland Climate <lb/>Grid&apos; above. Code is provided for linking and downloading the most relevant datasets in the FunCaB github <lb/>repository, with a time-stamper version on Zenodo 28 . See Fig. 2 for a conceptual representation of how these <lb/>datasets are linked via shared variables/keys. <lb/>In connection with a new project, FUNDER (Norwegian Research Council project number 315249, <lb/>2021 -2025), the FunCaB experiment will be augmented with data on the belowground components of the <lb/>plant-soil ecosystem, including roots, mesofauna, fungi and microbes. Plot-level slope, aspect, and soil depth <lb/>will also be measured. These data will link with the FunCaB and VCG project based on the given experimental, <lb/>site and organismal keys, as indicated in Fig. 3. <lb/>The VCG and FUNDER data will be made available in forthcoming data papers. <lb/>Data quality comments and options. The procedures and consequences for data collection, manage-<lb/>ment, and cleaning are detailed in this paper, and the associated code 28 . The code 28 describes and implements <lb/>our suggested data cleaning and checking procedures that result in producing what we consider the clean and <lb/>&apos;best practice&apos; final datasets 27 and the various &apos;flag&apos; , &apos;comment&apos; or&apos;notes&apos; columns in the different dataset tables <lb/>(Tables 2-9) that indicate additional specific data points that could be removed to create even more robust data-<lb/>sets. Users who might prefer stricter or more inclusive data handling strategies should check the flags in the raw <lb/>data sets and adjust the data cleaning accordingly. <lb/>Note that unidentified taxa are not harmonized across datasets (relevant for datasets ii, v, vi; Table 1). <lb/>Also note that dataset ii species-level forb biomass has some blocks where data at the species level is lacking <lb/>(11 cases, out of 48). For these blocks, the forb biomass is provided at the functional group level. <lb/>Dataset vi, seedling recruitment, does not contain any information on the plots that did not have any seed-<lb/>lings. If the user wants a complete dataset with all plots per site, for example for calculating overall seedling <lb/>densities per treatment or site, these missing plots need to be extracted from another dataset, e.g. dataset v, plant <lb/>community composition. <lb/>For dataset vii, ecosystem carbon fluxes, users might want to set more or less restrictive data exclusion thresh-<lb/>olds regarding linear fits of fluxes to include in analysis, and can do so by altering the cleaning code. For example, <lb/>many paired light-dark measurements were deleted due to the quality control of the light measurements. Users <lb/>who are interested in dark measurements only might be interested in accessing the full dark measurements <lb/>dataset available from the raw data available in 27 . If users want to visually inspect individual measurements and <lb/>set their own timeframes the code for running through individual combinations of metadata, logger data and <lb/>temperature data are provided in the OSF. Note that in 2016, some control plots shared with another experiment <lb/>(treatment = TTC) and other graminoid removal plots (treatment = RTC) from another project 35 , see also 42 , <lb/>were also measured. These measurements are found in the FunCaB flux dataset. <lb/></body>
