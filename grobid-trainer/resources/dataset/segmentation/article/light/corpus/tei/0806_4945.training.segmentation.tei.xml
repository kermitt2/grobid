			<body>At experimentally accessible energies, signals for <lb/>Lorentz and CPT violation can be described by a class <lb/>of extensions to the Standard Model often referred to <lb/>as the SME [1, 2]. This SME theory is an observer-<lb/>independent framework that contains all the Lorentz vio-<lb/>lating (LV) terms involving particle fields in the Standard <lb/>Model of particle physics and gravitational fields in the <lb/>General Theory of Relativity. Since the Standard Model <lb/>is thought to be the low-energy limit of a more funda-<lb/>mental theory that unifies quantum physics and gravity <lb/>at the Planck scale, m P ≃ 10 19 GeV, it is suggested <lb/>in [2] that the violations of Lorentz and CPT symme-<lb/>tries predicted by the SME provide a link to Planck scale <lb/>physics. Although the magnitude of LV signatures in the <lb/>accessible energy limit are suppressed a factor of or-<lb/>der the electroweak scale divided by the Planck scale, <lb/>m W /m P ∼ 10 −17 [3], these low-energy probes of new <lb/>physics have been explored in many ways with current <lb/>experimental technologies [4]. <lb/>The SME framework predicts several unconventional <lb/>phenomena, among which is one that arises from the de-<lb/>pendence of the neutrino oscillation probability on the <lb/>direction of neutrino propagation [3, 5]. For experiments <lb/>like MINOS [6] with both beam neutrino source and de-<lb/>tector fixed on the Earth&apos;s surface, the Earth&apos;s sidereal <lb/>rotation causes the direction of neutrino propagation p to <lb/>change with respect to the Sun-centered inertial frame in <lb/>which the SME is formulated [7]. The theory predicts <lb/>that this rotation introduces a sidereal variation in the <lb/>number of neutrinos detected from the beam. The LSND <lb/>collaboration [7] did not see this signal. In this paper we <lb/>use a sample of neutrinos identified in the MINOS near <lb/>detector (ND) in a search for this sidereal signal. The <lb/>neutrinos were generated by the Neutrinos at the Main <lb/>Injector (NuMI) neutrino beam at Fermilab [8], a beam <lb/>whose flavor composition is 98.7% ν µ + νµ [6]. <lb/>According to the SME, the probability that one of <lb/>these ν µ oscillates to flavor ν x , where x is e or τ , over <lb/>a distance L from its production to detection due to <lb/>Lorentz and CPT violation is given by [5] <lb/>P νµ→νx ≃ L 2 [(C) µx + (A c ) µx cos (ω ⊕ T ⊕ ) <lb/>+(A s ) µx sin (ω ⊕ T ⊕ ) + (B c ) µx cos (2ω ⊕ T ⊕ ) <lb/>+(B s ) µx sin (2ω ⊕ T ⊕ )] 2 , <lb/>(1) <lb/>where ω ⊕ = 2π/(23 h 56 m 04.0982 s ) is the Earth&apos;s side-<lb/>real frequency and T ⊕ is the local sidereal time of the <lb/> * Deceased. <lb/>neutrino detection. For the MINOS ND, &lt; L &gt;∼ 750 m. <lb/>In this equation, the expressions for (A c ) µx , (A s ) µx , and <lb/>(C) µx include both CPT and Lorentz violating terms; the <lb/>expressions for (B c ) µx and (B s ) µx include only Lorentz <lb/>violating terms. Since CPT violation implies Lorentz vi-<lb/>olation in field theory [9], there are no terms that depend <lb/>on CPT violation alone. These parameters are combi-<lb/>nations of the SME coefficients (a L ) µ and (c L ) µν that <lb/>describe LV [5]. The magnitude of the coefficients in <lb/>eq. (1) also depend on the neutrino propagation direc-<lb/>tion. For the NuMI beam line, the direction vectors of <lb/>the beam are defined by colatitude χ = (90 • − latitude) <lb/>= 90. • − 41.84056333 • , θ = 93.346 • , and φ = 23.909 • . <lb/>Here θ and φ are the beam zenith and azimuthal angles; <lb/>θ is measured from the z-axis which points toward the <lb/>zenith; φ is defined from the x-axis which is along the <lb/>detector axis and increases away from the NuMI target. <lb/>The y-axis makes a right handed coordinate system. The <lb/>explicit relationships between the SME coefficients and <lb/>the beam direction are found in [5]. In eq.(1), the CPT <lb/>violating terms depend on L and the Lorentz violating <lb/>terms depend on L × E ν , where E ν is the neutrino en-<lb/>ergy. This unconventional behavior is to be compared <lb/>with the L/E ν dependence of the oscillation probability <lb/>resulting from non-zero neutrino masses [10]. <lb/>The MINOS ND [11] is a magnetized 0.98 kton steel <lb/>scintillator tracking calorimeter that lies 103 m under-<lb/>ground at Fermilab and it is made of 282 4 × 6 m 2 oc-<lb/>tagonal planes. Each plane is comprised of a 2.54 cm <lb/>thick steel plate and a layer of scintillator strips with di-<lb/>mensions of 4.1 cm × 1 cm. Each scintillator strip is <lb/>coupled via wavelength-shifting fiber to one pixel of a <lb/>64-pixel Hamamatsu M64 PMT [12]. The ND readout <lb/>continuously integrates the PMT charges, while the data <lb/>acquisition accepts data above a threshold of 0.25 photo-<lb/>electrons. <lb/>Protons with mean energy of 120 GeV/c are extracted <lb/>from the Main Injector giving a beam spill of 10 µs du-<lb/>ration and period of approximately 2.4 s. The number <lb/>of protons delivered to the target for each spill (POT) <lb/>was measured using toroidal beam current transform-<lb/>ers. The uncertainty in the number of POT for each <lb/>spill is ±1.0% [6]. Neutrino events in the ND fiducial <lb/>volume were selected based on their timing and spatial <lb/>information [8, 13]. The neutrinos were separated into <lb/>charged current-like (CC) or neutral current-like (NC) <lb/>events, as described in [8]. CC ν µ events, identified by a <lb/>µ − track [6], were selected for further analysis to maxi-<lb/>mize the ν µ → ν x oscillation signal in MINOS. <lb/>Standard beam quality cuts [6] were applied to select <lb/>spills for the analysis. In addition, data quality cuts were <lb/></body>

The pa-<lb/>rameters for these two runs are given in Table I. The <lb/>numbers of events and POT given are the numbers re-<lb/>maining in the sample after all cuts have been made. <lb/>Since the sidereal phase histograms in this analysis re-<lb/>quire accurate event timing, we describe how time stamps <lb/>are generated. The spill time is determined by the Global <lb/>Positioning System (GPS) receiver located in the ND <lb/>hall that reads out absolute Universal Coordinated Time <lb/>(UTC) and is accurate to 200 ns [14]. The Main Injec-<lb/>tor accelerates protons to 120 GeV/c and the spills are <lb/>extracted to NuMI using a pulsed dipole magnet. The <lb/>GPS time of the extraction magnet signal is recorded <lb/>and defines the spill time [14]. <lb/>Each neutrino event was tagged with the local sidereal <lb/>time (LST) of its spill -the GPS spill time converted <lb/>to sidereal time. The local sidereal phase of an event is <lb/>given by LST×(ω ⊕ /2π) and has a range of 0-1. Event <lb/>times were not corrected for their time within a spill, an <lb/>approximation that introduces no significant systematic <lb/>error into the analysis. <lb/>The events in each spill were placed into a single bin in <lb/>a histogram spanning 0-1 in local sidereal phase (LSP). <lb/>The POT in the spill were binned into a second LSP <lb/>histogram. By dividing these two histograms, we get the <lb/>number of ν µ events/POT as a function of LSP. This <lb/>final histogram gives the normalized neutrino event rate <lb/>in which we search for sidereal variations. <lb/>We used 32 bins for the LSP histograms. This binning <lb/>was chosen to search for sidereal variations with a Fast <lb/>Fourier Transform (FFT) [15] and the algorithm works <lb/>most efficiently for 2 N bins. Since eq.(1) puts power into <lb/>harmonic frequencies associated with Fourier terms to <lb/>nω ⊕ , and for this analysis n = 1-4, we chose N = 5 as <lb/>the minimal binning that retains these harmonic terms. <lb/>Each bin spans 0.031 in LSP or 45 min in sidereal time. <lb/>The histograms of the ν µ events/POT as a function of <lb/>LSP for Run I and Run II are given in Fig. 1. The dif-<lb/>ferences in the average event rates are due primarily to <lb/>different relative positions of the target and magnetic fo-<lb/>cusing horns for the two runs. <lb/>We performed an FFT analysis on the Run I and Run <lb/>II sidereal phase histograms in Fig. 1 and we computed <lb/>the weighted mean of the powers returned for the even <lb/>(cos ) and odd (sin ) powers for harmonic frequencies out <lb/>to 4ω ⊕ T ⊕ . The weighting factors were the mean event <lb/>rates for each run. The resulting mean powers, p(F F T ), <lb/>are listed in Table II. <lb/>Local Sidereal Phase <lb/>0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>POT <lb/>14 <lb/>Events/10 <lb/>1.40 <lb/>1.45 <lb/>1.50 <lb/>1.55 <lb/>Run I <lb/>Run II <lb/>FIG. 1: The local sidereal phase histograms for Run I and <lb/>Run II.

We found that systematic increases or de-<lb/>creases in the event rate of 5% in 6 months do not affect <lb/>these results. We also searched for systematic changes <lb/>in the rates from day to night and found no variations <lb/>&gt; 0.1%. In addition, we searched and found no sidereal <lb/>modulation in the CC/NC ratio for these data. This test <lb/>shows that there are no systematic effects associated with <lb/>neutrino production in the beam that affect this sidereal <lb/>analysis. <lb/>We constructed 1,000 simulated experiments for both <lb/>runs without a sidereal signal to test the significance of <lb/>the powers given in Table II. We used the data them-<lb/>selves to construct these experiments. We first generated <lb/>1,000 sets of sidereal phases for Run I and Run II, with <lb/>each set having the same number of entries as spills in the <lb/>run. The phases were drawn randomly from the sidereal <lb/>phase distribution constructed from the start times for <lb/>each spill in the Run I or Run II data set. We then put <lb/>the events for each spill in the run into 1,000 separate <lb/>histograms according to the scrambled sidereal phase as-<lb/>signed. The number of POT for that spill was entered <lb/>into a second set of 1,000 histograms according to the <lb/>same set of sidereal phases. The division of each event <lb/>histogram by its corresponding POT histogram results in <lb/>the simulated experiments -histograms of the number of <lb/>ν µ events/POT as a function of LSP without a signal. <lb/></body>

Superposed on these distributions is a Gaussian fit of <lb/>width σ = 1.8 × 10 −2 . This fit was obtained independently <lb/>for both distributions. Values outside of the vertical lines are <lb/>more than 3σ from the mean. <lb/>We performed the same FFT analysis on each of the <lb/>1,000 Run I and 1,000 Run II simulated experiments as <lb/>was done with the sidereal phase histograms in Fig. 1. <lb/>The powers returned by these FFTs give the fluctua-<lb/>tion spectrum expected from sidereal phase histograms <lb/>in which there is no sidereal signal. As for the data, we <lb/>computed the weighted mean power for each harmonic <lb/>in a pair of simulated Run I and Run II experiments. <lb/>The distributions for the even (cos ) and the odd (sin ) <lb/>mean powers for harmonic frequencies out to 4ω ⊕ T ⊕ are <lb/>shown superposed in Fig. 2. Clearly these even and odd <lb/>distributions are nearly identical. In addition, a Gaus-<lb/>sian of width σ = 1.8 × 10 −2 has been superposed onto <lb/>these two distributions in Fig. 2. This fit was obtained <lb/>independently for both distributions. We use this Gaus-<lb/>sian to estimate the probability that the powers returned <lb/>by the FFT analysis of the sidereal phase histograms in <lb/>Fig. 1 are due to statistical fluctuations. <lb/>Table II gives the probability, P F , that the mean power <lb/>represents a noise fluctuation. It was calculated as the <lb/>probability of drawing a value of the weighted mean <lb/>power for the two data sets at least as large as found <lb/>from the parent Gaussian distribution in Fig. 2. Since <lb/>the largest fluctuation in the FFT power in the Fig. 1 <lb/>histogram is 1.32σ we conclude that no term reaches the <lb/>level of a 3σ detection. We have determined that these <lb/>results are insensitive to the exact choice of the zero point <lb/>of sidereal phase. This model-independent result implies <lb/>that there is no significant change in normalized neutrino <lb/>event rate that depends on the direction of the neutrino <lb/>beam in a sun-centered inertial frame. In the context of <lb/>the SME, this result is inconsistent with the detection of <lb/>TABLE III: Limits to SME coefficients for νµ → νx in terms <lb/>of the suppression factor mW /mP ∼ 10 −17 ; aL have units of <lb/>(GeV) and cL are unitless. <lb/>×10 −17 <lb/>×10 −17 <lb/>a X <lb/>L <lb/>3.0 × 10 −3 a Y <lb/>L <lb/>3.0 × 10 −3 <lb/>c T X <lb/>L <lb/>0.9 × 10 −5 c T Y <lb/>L <lb/>0.9 × 10 −5 <lb/>c XX <lb/>L <lb/>5.6 × 10 −4 c Y Y <lb/>L <lb/>5.5 × 10 −4 <lb/>c XY <lb/>L <lb/>2.7 × 10 −4 c Y Z <lb/>L <lb/>1.2 × 10 −4 <lb/>c XZ <lb/>L <lb/>1.3 × 10 −4 -<lb/>-<lb/>LV. <lb/>In the absence of a sidereal signal, we can establish up-<lb/>per limits on the SME coefficients (a L ) µ and (c L ) µν that <lb/>describe LV [5] using the standard MINOS Monte Carlo <lb/>simulation. The simulation includes weighting to account <lb/>for hadron production off the NuMI target [6]. In this <lb/>simulation, events are generated by modeling the NuMI <lb/>beam line, including the hadron production by the 120 <lb/>GeV/c protons on target, the propagation of the hadrons <lb/>through the focusing elements and 675 m decay pipe to <lb/>the beam absorber, and the calculation of the probabil-<lb/>ity that any neutrinos generated traverse the ND. The <lb/>ND neutrino event simulation takes the neutrinos from <lb/>the NuMI simulation, along with an energy determined <lb/>by decay kinematics, and uses this information as in-<lb/>put into the simulation of the ND. With the known L <lb/>and E ν for the simulated neutrino events, as well as the <lb/>beam direction, we can inject a Lorentz-violating signal <lb/>into eq.(1). The construction of MC-generated sidereal <lb/>phase histrograms is described elsewhere [16]. <lb/>The limits on the LV coefficients (a L ) µ and (c L ) µν <lb/>were determined from a set of 200 simulated experi-<lb/>ments. First we set all but one LV coefficient to zero. <lb/>We next weighted the simulated neutrino events in each <lb/>histogram by its survival probability computed accord-<lb/>ing to eq.(1), assuming the LV coefficient is small. We <lb/>then increased the magnitude of the nonzero coefficient <lb/>until one of the FFT powers in the simulated phase his-<lb/>togram was 3σ away from the mean of the distribution <lb/>in Fig. 2. An average of the 200 determinations of each <lb/>SME coefficient, scaled in terms of the suppression factor <lb/>m W /m p ∼ 10 −17 , is given in Table III. This procedure, <lb/>by which we vary one parameter at a time to determine <lb/>the limits, could miss fortuitous cancellations of SME co-<lb/>efficients thereby masking a signal. However, we consider <lb/>such cancellations in Nature to be highly unlikely. <lb/>In summary, we find no significant evidence for side-<lb/>real variations in the MINOS ND neutrino data. When <lb/>framed in the SME theory [5], this result leads to the <lb/>conclusion that we have detected no evidence for the vio-<lb/>lation of Lorentz and CPT invariance. Based on these re-<lb/>sults, we computed limits on the LV SME coefficients and <lb/>find that their magnitude is &lt; 1% of the suppression fac-<lb/>tor m W /m P ∼ 10 −17 . For the a L -type SME coefficients, <lb/>the MINOS limits are a factor of 3 lower than those re-<lb/>ported by LSND [7]; for the c L -type SME coefficients, the <lb/></body>
