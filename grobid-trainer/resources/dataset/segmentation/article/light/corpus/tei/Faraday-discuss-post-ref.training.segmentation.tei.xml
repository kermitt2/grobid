			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Molecular and hybrid organic-inorganic materials will gradually replace the harder <lb/>inorganic materials. The efficiency of some of these materials is linked to the <lb/>cooperativity concept which is widely used among the molecular materials <lb/>community. However, cooperativity is still not understood on physical and chemical <lb/>grounds; it needs thorough investigations of intermolecular interactions (hydrogen <lb/>bonds, van der Waals contacts, hydrophobicity, charge transfer…) which is a very <lb/>big challenge for both experimental and theoretical methods. This paper will <lb/>concentrate on the characterization of intermolecular contacs and on the estimation <lb/>of the molecular and atomic charges. Intermolecular interactions are usually <lb/>experimentally characterized by crystallographic or Raman-IR methods: <lb/>conventional crystallography gives interatomic distances which should be compared <lb/>to the sum of the so called &quot;ionic&quot; or &quot;van der Waals&quot; radii which are defined from <lb/>statistical analysis of experimental interatomic distances. IR or Raman methods <lb/>correlate intermolecular interactions to the variation of typical phonon or molecular <lb/>group modes but the assumption are also empirical and only qualitative. Therefore <lb/>one has to go a step further by modelling accurately the charge density in the <lb/>intermolecular regions: this will give a direct estimation of the molecular charges. <lb/>This can be achieved either by theoretical methods (Ab initio, DFT) or/and accurate <lb/>high resolution crystallography. 1,2 Once a model of the continuous charge density is <lb/>obtained, then a method has to be chosen for analysing the interactions and <lb/></body>

			<body>accurately estimate the atomic group or molecular charges. This method has to be <lb/>used on experimental and theoretical charge densities. <lb/>The charge concept of an atom is not based on physically measurable quantities <lb/>because it is subjected to atom partitioning. In fact, it is impossible to determine <lb/>unambiguously the atomic boundary inside which an atomic charge is located: <lb/>atomic charges depend on the form and the size of the integration volume and on the <lb/>atomic orbitals used (Ab Initio Methods). Hirshfeld has proposed in 1977 3 the <lb/>stockholder scheme using an atomic weighting function <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>w <lb/>sph <lb/>pro <lb/>sph <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= <lb/>v <lb/>(1) <lb/>where ρ sph is the electron density of the independent atom ( <lb/>sph <lb/>j <lb/>ρ ) or of the <lb/>promolecule ( <lb/>sph <lb/>pro <lb/>ρ ). When multiplied by the modelled density ( ) <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>ρ <lb/>the function <lb/>gives an estimation of the charge density of the j th atom of the unit cell <lb/>( ) ( ) ( ) <lb/>r <lb/>w <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>. <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>= <lb/>(2) <lb/>The limiting atomic volume is therefore given by a threshold of w j . Such atoms have <lb/>therefore some overlap. Coppens 4 has also proposed a method based on the Wigner-<lb/>Seitz method which defines an atomic polyhedron which boundaries are defined by <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>B <lb/>AB <lb/>B <lb/>A <lb/>AB <lb/>A <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>R <lb/>R <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>(3) <lb/>R AB being the internuclear distance and R A and R B are &quot;a priori&quot; atomic radii. This <lb/>method which was used to estimate the charge transfer in the TTF-TCNQ material <lb/>relies on the van der Waals radii. In conclusion all these partitioning applied to both <lb/>experimental and theoretical models are based on &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions. On the <lb/>other hand, Mulliken partitioning 5 is only used with theoretical electron density <lb/>whereas the κ-Pv refinement method 6 is widely used by X-ray diffractionists only : it <lb/>assumes an expanded/contracted spherical pseudoatom density <lb/>( ) <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>3 <lb/>r <lb/>P <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>j <lb/>val <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>val <lb/>j <lb/>core <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>κ <lb/>ρ <lb/>κ <lb/>ρ <lb/>ρ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>(4) <lb/>where ρ core and ρ val are HF electron densities of the free atoms. Other methods to <lb/>estimate charges are potential fitted charges 7,8 . We have shown that these fitted <lb/>charges are very close to those obtained directly by κ-Pv refinement. <lb/>Bader 9 proposed a topological analysis of the total electron density based on <lb/>quantum mechanics: the whole molecular system in the crystal is represented by a <lb/>sum of non overlapping atomic basins: their boundary surface is limited by zero flux <lb/>surfaces <lb/>0 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>). <lb/>( <lb/>= <lb/>∇ <lb/>r <lb/>n <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>ρ <lb/>(5) <lb/>Integration of charge, dipole and multipole moments inside the atomic basins can be <lb/>performed.

The tetrathiafulvalene-p-chloranil (TTF-CA; C 6 S 4 H 4 ·C 6 Cl 4 O 2 ) was <lb/>chosen because it shows small charge transfer (less than 1e) via intermolecular <lb/>interactions that depends on various thermodynamic parameters (T, P, hν). The TTF-<lb/>CA complex is built from donor (D=TTF) and acceptor (A=CA) -D-A-D-A-D-A <lb/>stacks and undergoes a first-order neutral-ionic phase transition (NIT) under <lb/>temperature variation at a critical temperature of about 80K 11,12 as well as under <lb/>pressure variation at a critical pressure of about 11kbar. 12,13,14 N to I or I to N <lb/>conversion can also be induced by photoirradiation as was shown by Koshihara et <lb/>al. 15 allowing for time-resolved crystallography of such a transformation at the <lb/>picosecond time scale. 16 <lb/>According to vibrational spectroscopy and absorption spectra experiments 17 , the <lb/>charge transfer (CT) qCT has been estimated to increase from 0.3e in the N phase to <lb/>0.7 in the I phase. It has been shown that this NIT comes along with a structural <lb/>phase transition characterized by the loss of inversion symmetry (P21/n to Pn space <lb/>group ) and a dimerization along the stacking axis. 18 <lb/>Before getting onto the main purpose of this work, crystallographical data need to <lb/>be reassessed along the temperature-induced neutral-ionic phase transition <lb/>undergone by TTF-CA, to ensure appropriate starting point. Based on the <lb/>outcoming X-ray structures obtained at 105 and 15 K, intra-and intermolecular <lb/>interactions are discussed on the ground of the topology of both experimental and <lb/>theoretical total electron densities . Corresponding D (TTF) and A (CA) single <lb/>crystals have also been investigated to provide benchmarks. Quantification of the <lb/>intermolecular interaction, charge transfer and the dipole moments through the <lb/>topological analysis of the electron density will be discussed. <lb/>2. Experimental section <lb/>2.1 Experimental details <lb/>TTF and CA powders were purchased from Lancaster and purified. Single crystals of TTF were <lb/>obtained by sublimation method. Chloranil crystals were obtained in acetonitrile solution. After a <lb/>few days of slow evaporation, prismatic yellow single crystals appear in the solution. Single crystals <lb/>of the TTF-CA complex were grown by sublimation of the component materials in a vacuum-sealed <lb/>Pyrex glass tube, which was placed at 79 °C in an electric furnace for several days. Dark prismatic-<lb/>like crystals were obtained. <lb/>The temperature evolution of the unit cell parameters was studied using a home-made helium bath <lb/>cryostat 19 specially designed for a four-circle diffractometer equipped with a 2D detector. The <lb/>sample is mounted on a two-circle goniostat placed in the Helium tail of the cryostat. This goniostat <lb/>is magnetically coupled to a master magnet fit on the arm of the diffractometer which allows the <lb/>orientation of the sample inside the cryostat. The cell parameters were determined by the analysis of <lb/>a set of 84 and 42 images, when cooling and warming, respectively, repeated from 110K to 50K, <lb/>with an accuracy of 0.02K. <lb/></body>

			<body>For the structures and charge density determinations, three-dimensional diffraction data were <lb/>collected on Enraf-Nonius Kappa and Oxford-Xcalibur-Sapphire2 CCD-based diffractometers with <lb/>MoKα radiation and a nominal crystal-to-detector distance of 40 mm. The crystal was cooled from <lb/>room temperature to 105K with an Oxford Cryosystems N2 open flow cryostat 20 and to 15K with an <lb/>Oxford Diffraction Helijet open-flow He gas cryosystem. <lb/>Integration of frames and data reduction were performed with DENZO 21 and CrysAlis Red <lb/>programs. The multiple integrated reflections were averaged using SORTAV 23 adapted to area <lb/>detector data. Internal agreement factors for all data are given in Table 1. Only reflections having I ≥ <lb/>3σ(I) were used in the structure and electron density least-squares refinements. <lb/>At 105K, TTF-CA crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/n (systematic absences: <lb/>h0l, h+l ≠ 2n; 0k0, k ≠ 2n). At 15K, diffraction intensities of (0k0) with k=2n+1 do exist, while <lb/>reflections (h0l) with h+l=2n+1 remain systematically absent in agreement with the loss of the 21 <lb/>screw axis, the space group of the ionic phase is then Pn. In order to compare both structures, the <lb/>coordinates x and z of the Cl19 atom were fixed at high temperature (HT) structure values and only <lb/>the y coordinate was refined for the low temperature (LT) data. Sorted data were merged in the m <lb/>point group, and anomalous dispersion corrections were performed as described in Souhassou et al. 24 <lb/>Experimental details are reported in Table 1. <lb/>Molecular structures of TTF-CA were solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier analysis, <lb/>then, refined, with a full-matrix least-squares refinement (independent atom model IAM, SHELXL-<lb/>97). 25 Hydrogen atoms were first constrained to positions contained from neutron diffraction <lb/>experiments. 18 The final refined parameters were imported into the MOLLY program to model the <lb/>aspherical electron density. 26 After convergence of the multipolar refinement, H atoms were allowed <lb/>to relax as their aspherical electron density features are taken into account in the multipolar <lb/>refinement, leading to unbiased H positions. Recently we have shown that this method gives best C-<lb/>H bond distances close within 0.03 A to distances usually found from neutron diffraction. 27 <lb/>It is very important to note that, although the molecules do not lie anymore on inversion centres in <lb/>the LT phase, molecular geometries are only slightly deformed, remaining almost centrosymmetric <lb/>as will be discussed later. This feature induces strong correlations between charge density <lb/>parameters of pseudo symmetry related atoms. In order to avoid these correlations, the following <lb/>approach was carried out: first all atoms positions and thermal parameters were refined together <lb/>without any constraints or restraints until convergence, and then the multipole parameters (all κ, Pv <lb/>and Plm) of atoms related by an inversion centre in the N phase were constrained to be equal. This <lb/>procedure leads to excellent statistical indexes as R factors are smaller than 1.3%. The maxima and <lb/>the minima in the residual density maps do not exceed 0.10e Ǻ -3 . The estimate of the average error <lb/>in the experimental electron density maps is 0.05 e.Ǻ -3 , as calculated by 28,29 <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>2 <lb/>/ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>/ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>∑ − <lb/>H <lb/>m <lb/>obs <lb/>res <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>K <lb/>V <lb/>σ <lb/>(6) <lb/>This error is largely smaller in the intermolecular region. <lb/>Aspherical modelling of the experimental X-ray structure factors provides the total electron density <lb/>distribution ρ(r) which is the main observable in the &quot;Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules&quot; <lb/>developed by Bader. 30 The topology of the total charge density allows a unique partition of the <lb/>density into atomic contributions, by defining atomic basin as the volume limited by zero electron <lb/>density gradient flux.

			<body>Electronic structure calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory <lb/>(DFT) using the local density approximation (LDA) parametrization by Perdew and Zunger 32 , <lb/>Becke&apos;s gradient correction to exchange energy 33 and Perdew&apos;s gradient correction to correlation <lb/>energy. 34 Calculations were carried out with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method 35 which <lb/>uses augmented plane waves to describe the full wave functions and densities without shape <lb/>approximation. The core electrons were described within the frozen core approximation. The plane <lb/>wave cutoff for wave functions and densities were fixed respectively to 90 and 360 Ry to ensure <lb/>required precision for topological analysis. Atomic coordinates were obtained from experimental X-<lb/>ray data obtained after complete multipolar refinement. CA and TTF isolated molecule calculations <lb/>were conducted using tetragonal supercells (12.5 x 12.5 x 7.5 Å for TTF and 12 x 12 x 7 Å for CA) <lb/>including electrostatic decoupling from periodic images. 36 For TTF-CA, crystal calculations were <lb/>performed with three k-points along a* . 37 Topological analysis of theoretical densities was achieved <lb/>with the InteGriTy software package using a grid spacing smaller than 0.044 Å. 38 <lb/>Compared to indirect methods, previous DFT investigation of CT complexes found that charge <lb/>transfer (qCT) is overestimated in the HT phase 37, 39 , certainly due to the approximation used for the <lb/>exchange and correlation potential that suffers from the well-kown problem of the self-interaction <lb/>error and to a much lesser extent from the missing of the dynamical part of the electron-electron <lb/>interactions in any local or semi-local approaches. One of the major effects of the too rapid decay <lb/>of the LDA (or even GGA) exchange-correlation potential is the strong charge delocalization, that <lb/>leads to a systematic overestimation of qCT in the HT phase for instance. 40 <lb/>3. Results and discussion <lb/>3.1 Thermal behaviour of the cell parameters <lb/>The evolution of the cell parameters as a function of temperature gives a clear evidence of the phase <lb/>transition at Tc = 81K: a and c cell parameters display a slope anomaly, while b presents an abrupt <lb/>jump; in all cases the contraction rate decreases below Tc. 41 Fig. 1a shows that on cooling β <lb/>decreases from 99.06(2)° to 98.68(2)° between 82 and 81K. However, when warming the increase <lb/>of the β angle occurs between 82 and 83.5K. This hysteresis of about 1K is also observed on the b <lb/>parameter (Fig. 1b) and confirms the observed evolution of the intensity of the (0 3 0) reflection. 41 <lb/>Thus all the cell parameters are sensible to the phase transition, reflecting the 3D character of the <lb/>temperature induced transition which will be studied using AIM method. <lb/>3.2 Structural properties: Phase transition <lb/>The molecular structures of TTF-CA at 105 and 15K with atom labelling are reported in Fig. 2. In <lb/>the high temperature phase (HT, T&gt;Tc) the TTF-CA space group is P21/n (monoclinic), and the TTF <lb/>and CA molecules form mixed stacks along a axis (Fig. 2a). The TTF and CA molecules lie both on <lb/>inversion centres respectively at (0 1/2 0) and (1/2 1/2 0) and all atoms are in general <lb/>crystallographic positions. Since D and A lie on inversion centres, the asymmetric unit is made of <lb/>half a TTF molecule and half a CA molecule. Along the stack, the TTF axis, corresponding to the <lb/>central C═C bond, forms an angle of 105.9(5)° with the CA O···O axis. As mentioned by Mayerle et <lb/>al. 42 and in agreement with the general trend observed in TTF-XA (X=F, Cl, Br) 42,43 , the best <lb/>overlap conditions between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of D and the lowest <lb/>unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of A are fulfilled when the angle between the O···O axis of <lb/>the XA molecule is almost orthogonal to that of the TTF molecule. An edge-on view of the <lb/>molecules shows several features of interest regarding the molecular configurations and packing. <lb/>The distance between the TTF and CA molecular centres in the stack is about half the a parameter <lb/>(i.e. 3.615(2) Å). However, the mean planes of the TTF and CA molecules are not parallel. The <lb/>dihedral angle is 1.6(5)°. This angle induces a close contact along the stack between a sulphur atom <lb/>S4 and the C15-C17 bond, which has an important contribution to the valence band. 37 This short <lb/>contact (i.e. 3.325(2) Å) favours the intermolecular interactions needed for the CT. <lb/>In the low temperature phase (LT, T&lt; Tc), the crystal space group of TTF-CA becomes Pn. While <lb/>keeping the same lattice translational symmetry, the organic stack gets dimerized. The asymmetric <lb/>unit is made of one TTF and one CA molecules, whose centroids are shifted from their HT phase <lb/>positions, mainly along a axis, e.g., the stacking axis: -0.08 Ǻ and 0.1 Ǻ for TTF and CA <lb/></body>

			<body>respectively (Fig. 2b). TTF and CA form pairs of D and A characterized by different intra-(dintra) <lb/>and inter-(dinter) pair distances, defined as the distances between the molecular centres (dintra= <lb/>3.416(4) Ǻ and dinter=3.785(4) Ǻ). However, as discussed in the dimerization process of <lb/>tetrathiafulvalene-p-bromanil (TTF-BA; C6H4S4· C6Br4O2) 43 , it is more relevant to compare the <lb/>closest intermolecular contacts: the shortest atom to atom contact in the stack connects a carbon <lb/>atom of the central C=C bond of TTF to a CA carbon bonded to an oxygen. Due to the dimerization, <lb/>two different distances are observed: an intradimer C9···C21 distance (3.136(4) Ǻ) and an interdimer <lb/>C2···C15 (3.531 (4) Ǻ), while in the HT phase both distances are equivalent by crystal symmetry <lb/>(3.370 Ǻ). Other close contacts originate from the overlap between CA&apos;s π electrons and the pz <lb/>orbital of one of TTF&apos;s sulphur atoms, defining S···C-C contacts. Two non equivalent contacts also <lb/>appear: the intrapair S11···C23-C15 is reinforced and the corresponding distance reduced to 3.158(4) <lb/>Ǻ, while the interpair S4···C21-C17 distance increases to 3.503(4) Ǻ. However, relative orientation <lb/>of D and A along the stack are comparable to that of the HT phase, the central C=C bond of TTF <lb/>forms an angle of 105.7(1)° with the O···O axes of CA, and the dihedral angle between the mean <lb/>planes of D and A is 1.1(1)°. <lb/>Intramolecular geometries of TTF and CA slightly change when cooling below Tc. In this way, the <lb/>multipolar refinement shows an increase of the TTF C=C bond lengths. This effect is larger for the <lb/>central C=C bond, from 1.3678(7) Ǻ at 105K to 1.3862(7) Ǻ at 15K. An inverse effect at the limit of <lb/>the experimental accuracy occurs for the C-S bonds, with distances decreasing from 1.7494(4) and <lb/>1.7500(4) Ǻ at 105K to 1.7429(8), 1.7440(9), 1.7439(9) and 1.7499(9) Ǻ at 15K. This evolution of <lb/>the C=C and C-S bonds is related to the change of qCT in the complex. The HOMO of TTF is π-<lb/>antibonding with respect to the C-S bonds and π-bonding with respect to the C=C bonds, thus, when <lb/>qCT increases, C-S bond lengths decrease, while C=C increase. 44 <lb/>In the CA molecule all bond lengths are modified due to the phase transition, i.e. by the increase of <lb/>qCT. The single C-C bond lengths decrease, while C=C double bonds increase. However the effect is <lb/>larger for C=O and C-Cl bond lengths. The C=O double bonds increase from 1.2227(4) Ǻ at 105K <lb/>to 1.237(1) Ǻ for both C=O bonds at 15K. The C-Cl bond lengths also increase from 1.7062(4) and <lb/>1.7037(4) to 1.7234(9), 1.7190(9), 1.7176(9) and 1.7162(9) Ǻ. Hence, as the LUMO of CA is π <lb/>antibonding for both C=O and C-Cl, these bonds increase when qCT becomes higher. <lb/>Finally, the Uij anisotropic thermal parameters at 15K are roughly half than those at 105K. This <lb/>usual behaviour, also observed in TTF-BA 43 , largely contrasts with the trends observed in other CT <lb/>complexes, such as DMTTF-CA, where some anisotropic temperature factors along the stacking <lb/>axis increase below 65K, suggesting an order-disorder type of phase transition. 45 <lb/>We can conclude that the observed geometrical changes of TTF and CA are due to the increase of <lb/>the qCT between D and A in the complex. But, contrary to the neutron LT structure 18 , where the <lb/>bond lengths in half a TTF molecule are reported to be 1-2% longer than in the other half, this work <lb/>shows that the NIT does not induce such large differences. In fact, in the LT phase both TTF and <lb/>CA moieties remain almost centrosymmetric. Our results are in agreement with recent synchrotron <lb/>results 46 that show bond lengths differences of the order of the estimated errors (0.004 A). <lb/>Therefore, such small differences cannot characterize the phase transition. One reason for the <lb/>discrepancies between neutron and X-Ray structures arises from the small observation/parameter <lb/>ratio that allowed only for isotropic estimation of Debye Waller factors in the neutron case whereas <lb/>a full multipolar refinement was performed on X-ray data. <lb/>3.3 Charge transfer and volumes <lb/>CT is at the origin of the very interesting electronic, magnetic and optical properties of the CT <lb/>complexes, and therefore its accurate determination is essential to understand, classify and control <lb/>them. However, as discussed on the introductory paragraph, it is not a well-defined quantity and <lb/>there are several experimental and theoretical methods to calculate it. For TTF-CA, it has been <lb/>estimated from the CT absorption band 47 , from vibrational spectroscopy 17,48 and by empirical <lb/>relations between qCT and D or A geometry. 49 All these methods lead per se to indirect estimations <lb/>of qCT. In order to avoid both transferability problems and at the same time to allow for more direct <lb/>determinations of qCT, these determinations should be obtained from intrinsic properties, e.g., the <lb/>electronic structure of the CT complex. These has already been achieved for a couple of NIT <lb/></body>

			<body>compounds on the basis of DFT calculations 37,39 , in particular using &quot;Quantum Theory of Atoms in <lb/>Molecules&quot;. 30 For TTF-CA, integration over atomic basins leads to qCT of 0.48 and 0.64 e <lb/>respectively at 300 and 40K. Clearly, qCT is overestimated in the HT phase due to the approximation <lb/>used for the exchange and correlation (see section 2.2). <lb/>As discussed above and observed in several TTF-based donor molecules 50 , oxidation of donor <lb/>molecules produces variations in the central C=C and C-S bond lengths. First principle studies of <lb/>TTF 44 and CA 51 isolated molecules in different oxidation states have established the linear effects <lb/>of molecular ionicity on bond lengths and several vibrational frequencies. In particular, C=O and C-<lb/>Cl bonds of chloranil and central C=C and C-S bonds in TTF are shown to be particularly sensible to <lb/>molecular ionicity. These dependences have been related to the contributions of the bonds to the <lb/>LUMO of CA and HOMO of TTF. However, it has been stressed that these linear relationships may <lb/>fail due to intermolecular interactions. Moreover, concerning frequency, electron-intramolecular-<lb/>vibration interactions should not be disregarded. 52 Examination of the Cambridge Structural Data <lb/>Base has allowed Umland and co-workers 49 to establish linear relationships between qCT and several <lb/>functions (ratio and difference) of these C=C and C-S TTF bonds. This approach was used to <lb/>estimate qCT in TTF-CA 18 from experimental bond lengths: values of 0.4 and 0.8 e were deduced at <lb/>300 and 40K respectively. <lb/>Starting from our more accurate structural data, the estimates are qCT =0.40 e at 105K and qCT =0.65 <lb/>e at 15K. However, if we consider the values of the bond lengths of TTF and CA reported for <lb/>different oxidation states 44,51 , charge transfer variations (ΔqCT) from 105K to 15K of 0.4 and 0.5 e <lb/>are obtained using C=O and C-Cl bond lengths respectively. From the TTF C=C and C-S bonds, <lb/>ΔqCT of 0.5 and 0.15e are obtained respectively. When using bond lengths obtained for crystals of <lb/>pure TTF or CA as reference (qCT = 0) and the slopes determined by DFT calculations, 44,51 results <lb/>become worse. Indeed, C-Cl bonds lead to qCT ≈ -0.1 and qCT ≈ 0.4 e, C-S to qCT ≈ 0.8 and qCT ≈ 0.9 <lb/>e whereas the central C=C bond of TTF to qCT ≈ 0.7 and qCT ≈ 1.1 e, respectively at 105 and 15K. <lb/>Thus, using such approaches to determine qCT is clearly hazardous, and it gives only qualitative <lb/>trends for ΔqCT. From all these linear relationships ΔqCT ranges from 0.2 to 0.5e at the NIT. <lb/>Therefore a direct estimation is needed, based on intrinsic properties, like the electronic structure of <lb/>the complex. Experimentally, the charge transfer can be obtained from X-ray diffraction data in two <lb/>ways. First, a refinement in reciprocal space with a modified spherical valence shell (κ-Pv formalism <lb/>6 ), according to equation 4, allows an estimation of the net atomic charges. A similar method was <lb/>proposed by Espinosa et al. 53 to estimate the charge transfer in bis(thiodimethylene)-<lb/>tetrathiafulvalene tetracyanoquinodimethane (BTDMTTF-TCNQ, C10H8S6 + ·C12H4N4 -) using a Plm <lb/>multipolar refinement , the atomic net charges can be obtained as: <lb/>val <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>P <lb/>N <lb/>q <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>(7) <lb/>The obtained charge transfer for BTDMTTF-TCNQ (0.75e) has to be compared with the value <lb/>derived from the diffuse scattering experiments (0.5e). 54 <lb/>Both κ-Pv and Plm refinements have been performed in TTF-CA using electroneutrality constraint, <lb/>i.e. the total charge of the unit cell is zero. Thus, these two approaches lead respectively to charge <lb/>transfers of of 0.14±0.05 and 0.06±0.05e at 105K, while the values increase to 0.67±0.03 and <lb/>0.65±0.03 e at 15K. There are not significant differences between the results obtained which show <lb/>the consistency of the X-ray method. <lb/>Finally, the topology of the charge density provides another tool to determine the charge transfer, as <lb/>the sum of the atomic topological charges obtained by integration of the experimental/theoretical <lb/>charge density over the atomic basins of all atoms of each molecule leads to the molecular charge <lb/>and thus to qCT. These molecular charges and basin volumes obtained are listed in Table 2 and are <lb/>compared to those obtained for the CA and TTF single crystals. Within TTF-CA at 105K, the <lb/>experimental charges of CA and TTF are respectively -0.22(2) and 0.20(2) e, increasing to -0.71(2) <lb/>and +0.77(2) e at 15K. Consequently, the experimental qCT is 0.21 ± 0.02 at HT and 0.74 ± 0.02 at <lb/>LT, and ΔqCT =0.53 e. The same approach using the theoretical charge density leads to qCT ≈ 0.64e <lb/>for the LT phase. How can we gauge our approach? First, our values are in pretty good agreement <lb/>with the κ-Pv and Plm derived charges. Secondly, considering that the unit cell contains two TTF and <lb/>two CA molecules, a comparison between the volume filled by the atomic basins and the unit cell <lb/>volume allows for gauging the accuracy of the methods. Summation of the atomic volumes (Table <lb/>2) reproduces the cell volume within less than 0.3%, for both temperatures at experimental and <lb/>theoretical levels. This nicely demonstrates the ability of such approaches to tackle such small <lb/>changes, especially regarding atomic quantities. Correlatively, the net integrated charge of the unit <lb/>cell is also very close to zero. <lb/>As the temperature decreases from 105K to 15K, the TTF volume decreases from ≈ 1.5-2.5 %, while <lb/>the CA&apos;s volume remains almost constant. In fact, as CT increases, TTF looses electron density in <lb/>favour of CA and volume reduction follows. Moreover, from experiments on TTF-based CT <lb/>complexes 55 and ab-initio calculations 44 it is well known that the geometry of TTF is responsive to <lb/>environmental effects and phase transitions. On the other hand, the CA electron density increases <lb/>with CT while lattice parameters shrink, thus maintaining constant the CA molecular volume. <lb/>Additionally, CA peripheral atoms contain a large number of core electrons that prevents large <lb/>volume variations compared to TTF. This is particularly clear when volumes obtained within a TTF-<lb/>CA crystal are compared to those obtained on pure TTF and CA single crystals (Table 2). <lb/>3.4 Dipole moment <lb/>The calculation in the crystal axis system of the dipole moment for the dimer in the ionic phase can <lb/>be performed, considering both contributions: the net atomic charges and the atomic dipoles <lb/>obtained once the topological analysis has been completed. Obviously, the net charge contribution is <lb/>mainly along the stacking axis a: (-12.585, -0.086, 0.155) D. But the contribution of the atomic <lb/>dipole moments, (16.293, -7.027, 0.457) D, is large, almost lying in the (a,b) plane reflecting not <lb/>only the π-π interactions between D and A (along a), but also interstack interactions that are <lb/>dominated by hydrogen bonds as will be discussed in section 3.6.2. <lb/>Following dimerization, a ferroelectric dipole moment Δ µ= µdimer -µinterdimer appears. Values of 0.36 <lb/>D in the stack and 0.72 D in the unit cell are found. The corresponding dipolar energy, <lb/>Wd= ( Δ µ) 2 / 4πε0V, 56 where V is the volume occupied by the dipole moment, is 6.63x10 -21 J. This <lb/>small value compared to kBTN-I (Wd / kB=4.8K) shows that long-range dipolar interactions are not <lb/>the driving force for the NIT, in agreement with previous findings. 18 <lb/>3.5 Covalent bonds <lb/>A quantitative comparison of the covalent bonds strength can be derived from their topological <lb/>properties. For each type of covalent bond, similar features are found irrespective of molecular <lb/>environment, e.g. in TTF-CA, TTF or CA crystals or for calculated isolated molecules. <lb/>Accumulation of electron density is particularly visible in double bonds, the highest density being <lb/>observed within the C=O bond. The Laplacian of the density also reveals the oxygen lone pairs and <lb/>the non bonding valence shells of both chlorine and sulphur atoms. Interestingly, while other <lb/>covalent bonds show almost equal λ1 and λ2 curvatures at CPs, indicative of cylindrical symmetry <lb/>perpendicularly to the bonds, the λ1 and λ2 values obtained for all C=C bonds differ significantly <lb/>(about 30%). <lb/>The NIT affects clearly all bond critical points as exemplified by the C2=C9 bond, for which the <lb/>distance increases from 1.3678(7) to 1.3862(7) Å, the density decreases from 2.16 to 2.05 eǺ -3 and <lb/>∇ 2 ρ(rCP) changes from 21 eǺ -5 to 18 eǺ -5 when decreasing the temperature from 105 to 15K. <lb/>Again, this is directly related to the bonding character of the C=C bonds in the HOMO of TTF. Both <lb/>C-S and C-Cl bonds are less responsive to CT variation. For C-S, the average experimental <lb/>∇ 2 ρ(rCP) and ρ(rCP) vary from -7.2 eǺ -5 , 1.33 eǺ -3 at 105K to -6.2 eǺ -5 , 1.31 eǺ -3 at 15K. These <lb/>values are in good agreement with the literature. 57 On average, the C-Cl bond CPs lie at 0.76 Å and <lb/>0.96 Å from the C atom and the Cl atom respectively. This is directly related to their respective <lb/>atomic volumes. Moreover, the valence shell charge concentration of the Cl atom is strongly <lb/>polarized toward the nearby C atom (bonded charge concentration). In the direction of such a polar <lb/>bond, there is a lack of charge accumulation near the more electronegative atom. This behaviour is <lb/>also characteristic of C-O and C-F bonds. 58 During the NIT, C-Cl bonds lengths increase from <lb/>1.7045(4) to 1.7191(9) Å in average. ∇ 2 ρ(rCP) and ρ(rCP) change from -4.8 eǺ -5 , 1.40 eǺ -3 at HT to <lb/>-4.1 eǺ -5 , 1.32 eǺ -3 at LT. <lb/>The overall agreement between theoretical and experimental results is quite good for all bond CP <lb/>characteristics. Among the differences, theory gives systematically slightly higher ρ(rCP) than that <lb/>deduced from experiment and lower curvatures along the bond path (λ3) for all bonds except C=O. <lb/>The picture becomes more tricky for C=O bonds: calculated values of ∇ 2 ρ(rCP) show pronounced <lb/>deviation from experimental ones, especially for λ3: experimental/theoretical values of ∇ 2 ρ(rCP) are <lb/></body>

			<body>-28/3 eǺ -5 at 105K and -19/-1 in average at 15K. Such a discrepancy between experiment and theory <lb/>has already been reported in the literature, and explained as originated by the different nature of the <lb/>radial functions used in DFT and multipolar refinements. 59 It should also be underlined that, <lb/>because of the fast variation of the density along the C=O bond path, computations of λ3 and <lb/>∇ 2 ρ(rCP) are not straightforward, especially when working with densities on grids. 38 However, <lb/>experimental and theoretical ρ(rCP) are in excellent agreement: 2.91/2.71 at HT and 2.72/2.63 eǺ -3 at <lb/>LT. <lb/>3.6 Intermolecular Interactions <lb/>Up to now, in the TTF-CA family, crystallographic investigations have characterized the <lb/>intermolecular interactions only by distances between interacting atoms. Accurate electron density <lb/>studies may go a step further, using topological analysis to describe H bonds and van der Waals <lb/>interactions by energetical quantities at the intermolecular CPs associated with the interaction. For <lb/>example, Espinosa et al. 10, 60 have shown exponential relations between the charge density at CP and <lb/>the potential and kinetic energy densities at CP. Such analysis needs very accurate data and a <lb/>software able to calculate properties at the CP (where the density seldom reaches 0.1 eǺ -3 ) with a <lb/>good precision. Moreover, the corresponding gradient change is very small (flat density) makes the <lb/>determination of the bond path difficult. This is even more difficult when van der Waals interactions <lb/>are concerned. The experimental studies described here are accurate enough to characterize the <lb/>topological properties at CP within a relative error estimated to a maximum of 20%. The most <lb/>difficult problem is to locate accurately the CP. When the density is obtained from analytical model <lb/>like multipole refinement, an analytical calculation of the derivatives of ( ) <lb/>r <lb/>r <lb/>ρ <lb/>for estimating the <lb/>topological properties may be performed; 31 in that way the errors are limited only to the <lb/>experimental error on the charge density. The topological analysis of the DFT density has been done <lb/>on a grid 38 the positions and the properties of the CPS depend on the grid size and to low extended <lb/>on the interpolation procedure when the charge density is flat. <lb/>3.6.1. Intrastack Interactions <lb/>Starting from the published structures at 300 and 40 K 18 , Oison et al. 37 have conducted a thorough <lb/>ab-initio study of TTF-CA. Despite differences in molecular geometries discussed in sect. 3.2, our <lb/>experimental and theoretical findings on intermolecular interactions are consistent with their results. <lb/>In particular, topological analysis of the charge density of the HT phase shows the existence of (3,-<lb/>1) CPs lying between TTF and CA in a plane parallel to the molecules. According to their <lb/>Laplacian, charge density and potential energy density, only the most important contacts are <lb/>reported in Table 3 and discussed here. The strongest contact between D and A molecules is clearly <lb/>visible in Fig. 3a. At HT, a 0.06 eǺ -3 isocontour links the two molecules via the S4···C15-C17 <lb/>contact. This is directly related to the HOMO-LUMO overlap that shows up in the valence band. 37 <lb/>The positive Laplacian (0.59/0.56 eǺ -5 ) and the charge density (0.06/0.06 eǺ -3 ) at the CP are <lb/>characteristic of a closed-shell interaction (Fig. 2a). The agreement between experimental and <lb/>theoretical results is quite good, but discrepancies are observed in the CP locations and ellipticities <lb/>as discussed previously. Experimentally, the CP is closer to the C17 atom than to C15, whereas <lb/>theoretically C15 and C17 distances to the CP are similar. Both experimental and theoretical <lb/>ellipticities are quite large. This is an indication that the difference in CP location arises from the <lb/>flatness of the charge density distribution. In the same way, the central C=C bond of TTF is <lb/>connected to C15 in the experimental density and to C17 in the theoretical one, again with quite <lb/>large ellipticities. Moreover, both contacts involve the same carbon atoms of CA, namely C17 and <lb/>C15. Consequently, it becomes very risky to deduce whether these contacts link individual atoms or <lb/>bridge over bonds. Increased theoretical and experimental precision is required to come to a <lb/>conclusion for such low and flat charge density regions. <lb/>Other (3,-1) CPs are found between the S5 atom and both chlorine atoms of the asymmetric unit. <lb/>These Cl19···S5 and Cl20···S5 contacts exhibit similar characteristics with experimental positive <lb/>Laplacian of about 0.43 eǺ -5 , a small charge density of 0.04-0.05 eǺ -3 , and a potential energy <lb/>density of about -8.1 kJ/mol. CPs in Cl···S contacts are not very frequent in literature. Compared to <lb/>S···S contacts reported in L-cystine 57a , Laplacian, charge density and potential energy density are <lb/>stronger. <lb/>In the LT phase, the creation of pairs of DA dimers clearly shows up (Fig. 3b) with an increase of <lb/>intradimer charge density. Due to the dimerization process, different inter-and intra dimer CP are <lb/>observed (Fig. 2b, Table 3). The S···C-C intra dimer contact remains the dominant one, with a 81% <lb/>increase in its strength as measured by V(r). In the dimer pair the strength of the C···C-C and <lb/>S5···Cl20 increases, while that of S5···Cl19 is slightly reduced. All inter-dimer contacts are <lb/>systematically reduced and the observed reduction of CP characteristics, such as potential energy <lb/>density, demonstrates their ability to investigate that tiny structural changes. The overall agreement <lb/>between experimental and theoretical results is quite good. <lb/>3.6.2 Interchain Interactions <lb/>As c cell parameter is twice the length of the two other ones, the stacks are too far along c to allow <lb/>any atom to atom interactions. Consequently, contacts occur between stacks related by translation <lb/>along b axis, and by the n glide plane symmetry which remains in the ionic phase (P21/n to Pn). <lb/>Interestingly, (3,-1) CPs are found not only on C-H···O, Cl···H and Cl···S contacts between D and A <lb/>molecules, but also for S···H (D-D) and Cl···Cl (A-A) ones, as shown in Fig. 4a and in Fig. 4b; the <lb/>topological characteristics of the strongest interstack interactions for both HT and LT phases are <lb/>given in Table 4. <lb/>At first observed by the temperature-dependence of the thermal expansion tensor 61 , and as discussed <lb/>by structure analysis 18 and DFT calculations 37,62 , interchain hydrogen bonds are the dominant <lb/>interaction in TTF-CA for both inter and intra stack interactions. In both HT and LT phases each CA <lb/>oxygen atom is linked to two TTF molecules through two different hydrogen bonds. First, as shown <lb/>in Figures 4a and 4b, the oxygen atoms accept the strongest bond interaction: O18···H6-C1 and <lb/>O24···H13-C8 its symmetry equivalent in the HT phase, are almost linear in the [1, 2, 0] direction <lb/>and are reinforced in the LT phase, but asymmetrically, O18···H6 being the strongest. In the other <lb/>lone pair direction the O18···H14-C10 and O24···H7-C3 interactions are bent and therefore weaker. <lb/>They are also strengthened in the ionic phase as their potential energy density increases by more <lb/>than 40%. This is related to the contraction of the crystal which is the largest in the plane containing <lb/>this C-H···O network. 61 <lb/>The fact that the H bonds are the dominant contacts of all the intra-and interstack interactions <lb/>contrasts with the first idea of the quasi-one-dimensionality of TTF-CA. The CT was for a long time <lb/>considered to happen as a chain along a axis, with weak or no interchain coupling. In this way, the <lb/>electrostatic interaction between the stacks was assumed to be much smaller than the intrastack one. <lb/>However, as discussed above, the temperature evolution of the cell parameters does not agree with <lb/>this assumption. Furthermore, as reported by Kawamoto and co-workers 63 , if the charge distribution <lb/>on atoms is considered, the electrostatic energy between TTF and CA aligned along the [1, 2, 0] <lb/>direction is attractive and superior to the repulsive one between CA molecules in the b direction; It <lb/>is in clear agreement with the above analysis of the dipole moment. On the other hand, it is well <lb/>established that valence and conduction bands have a clear one-dimensional character. 37 Thus, the <lb/>dimensionality of TTF-CA depends strongly on the property of interest. <lb/>In TTF-BA, the estimation of qCT by the Umland empirical method 49 seems to show that <lb/>dimerization does not imply CT variation because this complex is already ionic at room <lb/>temperature. 43 Can we find a rational explanation by looking at the molecular packing and the <lb/>corresponding intermolecular interactions? In TTF-BA, (space group P-1 to P1), the D and A <lb/>molecules alternate along a and b crystallographic axes, the longest axes of the D and A molecules <lb/>of the two different stacks being quasiparallel. This geometry leads to bent H bonds, with distances <lb/>similar to those observed in TTF-CA and therefore of equivalent strength. The main difference <lb/>between the two CT complexes comes from the halogen-halogen (C1-X1···X2-C2) interactions. <lb/>Depending on the geometric parameters two types of halogen-halogen interactions have been <lb/>defined. 64,65 In the first one, called head-on contact, both C-X bonds form a nearly collinear <lb/>arrangement, with contacts angles θ1 (C1-X1···X2) and θ2 (X1···X2-C2) around 160±10°. These <lb/>contacts may arise when a particular crystallographic operation relates the two halogen atoms; the <lb/>interaction is repulsive as evidenced by the electrostatic potential. 66 In the second type, the <lb/>interaction is attractive and is called side-on or polarization-induced contact, one of the angles is <lb/>170±10° and the other 90±10°. 64,65 The preference to form one of these two types of halogen-<lb/>halogen contacts is related to the polarizability of the halogen atoms. In TTF-BA attractive type II <lb/>interactions occur along the [1 1 1] and [1, 1, -1] directions with Br···Br distances of 3.566(3) at <lb/></body>

			<body>100K and 3.540(3) Ǻ at 15K, much smaller than the sum of van der Waals radii (3.70Å). In TTF-<lb/>CA, Cl···Cl interactions are repulsive type I interactions with distances of about 3.470(3)Å close to <lb/>the sum of van der Waals radii (3.50Å). <lb/>In conclusion, attractive interactions lead to X···X distances smaller than van der Waals contacts, <lb/>whereas the repulsive Cl…Cl interactions do not allow such shortening. Topological parameters of <lb/>the Cl···Cl contacts do not change very much upon the phase transition, as shown in Table 4. <lb/>4. Conclusion and perspectives <lb/>Accurate X-ray measurement and electron density modelling is a necessary tool to directly <lb/>investigate intermolecular interactions and tiny charge transfers. For the TTF-CA crystal, the <lb/>topological analysis of the intermolecular interactions using theoretical DFT and experimental <lb/>electron densities show that C-H···O interstack contacts are the strongest interactions and are <lb/>reinforced in the LT phase, whereas the strength of the Cl···Cl interactions, which may be repulsive <lb/>in that case, do not change when crossing the transition. The role of the latter is still not clear and <lb/>needs further discussion as for example electrostatic potential calculations. <lb/>This study also demonstrates that agreement between theory and experiment is not fully satisfactory <lb/>and requires more accurate calculations and modelling: theory is not able to reproduce the charge <lb/>transfer occurring during the NIT and both experiment and theory disagree in the position of the <lb/>critical points of some important intermolecular interactions as Cl···Cl for example. More critical is <lb/>the disagreement for finding the C2=C2···C15 (or C17) interaction pathway: both methods find a (3,-<lb/>1) CP with similar characteristics but experiment would prefer a C2···C15 interaction when theory <lb/>finds a C2···C17 interaction. Therefore the present accuracy does not allow to discriminate if this <lb/>interaction links individual atoms (and which atoms) or bridges over bonds. <lb/>By comparison with previous work 43 , halogen... halogen interactions need a better description in <lb/>order to know when and why these interactions are attractive or repulsive and at which level they <lb/>compete with C-H···O interactions during the phase transition process. In order to rank these <lb/>interactions charge density and related electrostatic potential of TTF -XA (X = F, Br, I) are <lb/>underway using high resolution X-ray diffraction: as an example Fig. 5 shows the contribution of the <lb/>Cl atom to the electrostatic potential of CA in the ionic phase; clearly two negative lobes appear <lb/>which should be related with the attractive or repulsive behaviour of X···X interactions. Although <lb/>the potential distribution is the same than that observed in the vicinity of the terminal halide ligand <lb/>of CH3Cl 66 , where the electrostatic energy of the minima is -80 kJ/mol; in TTF-CA -25 and -148 <lb/>kJ/mol are respectively obtained at 105 and 15K Therefore, together with the TTF, CA and TTF-CA <lb/>charge densities, we will have a large panorama of the interactions as a function of the charges, <lb/>multipole moments, polarizabilities of the halogen atoms and of the geometry and environment of <lb/>the contacts. <lb/>It has been shown that the charge transfer is not an unambiguously defined quantity that can be <lb/>directly (charge density modelling) or indirectly estimated from molecular geometry or IR spectra. <lb/>Although D and A molecular geometries are sensible to the charge transfer, its estimation by <lb/>empirical models is only qualitative: examination of different bond lengths leads to different qCT <lb/>values. Similarly, the variation of qCT is supposed to be proportional to the frequency of typical <lb/>phonon modes (e.g., C=O stretching modes of CA). Moreover, these methods present inevitable <lb/>ambiguities: molecular geometries and frequencies of single TTF and CA molecules are used as <lb/>references, because those of TTF-CA with qCT=0 and qCT=1e are not known. <lb/>To our opinion the best way to determine the charges remains in the analysis of the experimental or <lb/>theoretical charge density. The case of TTF-CA complex has been chosen because the CT is less <lb/>than one electron shared by 26 atoms. We have shown that both κ-Pv and Plm models give similar <lb/>and realistic results for the charge transfer. However, they can not be compared with theoretical <lb/>results, except if we transform the charge density into the theoretical structure factors. A direct <lb/>comparison is possible with a topological analysis of the charge density as described by Bader that <lb/>allows for a direct accurate estimation of the charge transfer occurring during the NIT (in the <lb/>experimental case ,∆qCT=0.53e). <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>In conclusion these results show that Kappa, multipole and topological methods applied to X-ray <lb/>data lead to statistically similar results respectively, ∆qC =0.53, 0.59 and 0.53e. This raises the <lb/>following question; why do we obtain such a good agreement as the definitions of the κ-Pv and <lb/>topological charges are clearly different: κ-Pv (or multipolar) charges are integrated from reciprocal <lb/>space calculations on spherical volumes obtained from expanded or contracted HF free infinite <lb/>atoms whereas the topological charges are integrated inside very non spherical atomic basins of <lb/>limited volumes. It evidently leads to very different atomic net charges as shown in Table 5 which <lb/>compares them in the LT phase. <lb/>An explanation may be the following: in TTF CA the charge which we consider is summed up over <lb/>the whole TTF or CA molecule and the different shapes of atoms therefore has no real importance <lb/>because the charge is integrated over the whole molecular volume. Therefore, as there is an <lb/>electroneutrality constraint in the refinement process and as we have shown that the total charge <lb/>summed over all atomic basins of the unit cell is only -0.02 and 0.06e at 105K and 15K, instead of <lb/>zero (Table 3), the small differences between the values obtained from the two methods comes only <lb/>from the periphery of the molecules which electron density is small. Therefore as both charge <lb/>partitioning agree it strengthens the X-ray approach but this conclusion drawn in this particular case <lb/>needs to be discussed and confirmed by other charge estimations on other selected charge transfer <lb/>materials or ionic species. <lb/></body>
