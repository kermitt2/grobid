The results and the analyses reported by last year&apos;s participants sug-<lb/>gested that the changes introduced in the previous campaign had led to a drop in <lb/>systems&apos; performance. So for this year&apos;s competition it has been decided to practi-<lb/>cally replicate last year&apos;s exercise. <lb/>Following last year&apos;s experience some QA pairs were grouped in clusters. Every <lb/>cluster was characterized by a topic (not given to participants). The questions from <lb/>a cluster contained co-references between one of them and the others. Moreover, <lb/>as last year, the systems were given the possibility to search for answers in Wiki-<lb/>pedia 1 as document corpus beside the usual newswire collection. <lb/>In addition to the main task, three additional exercises were offered, namely the <lb/>Answer Validation Exercise (AVE), the Question Answering on Speech Tran-<lb/>scriptions (QAST), which continued last year&apos;s successful pilot, and Word Sense <lb/>Disambiguation for Question Answering (QA-WSD). <lb/>As general remark, it must be said that the task still proved to be very challenging <lb/>for participating systems. In comparison with last year&apos;s results the Best Overall <lb/>Accuracy dropped significantly from 41,75% to 19% in the multi-lingual subtasks, <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>QA@CLEF 2008 was carried out according to the spirit of the campaign, con-<lb/>solidated in previous years. Beside the classical main task, three additional exer-<lb/>cises were proposed: <lb/>• the main task: several monolingual and cross-language sub-tasks, were of-<lb/>fered: Bulgarian, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, <lb/>Greek, Basque and Spanish were proposed as both query and target languages. <lb/>• the Answer Validation Exercise (AVE) [2]: in its third round was aimed at eva-<lb/>luating answer validation systems based on textual entailment recognition. In <lb/>this task, systems were required to emulate human assessment of QA responses <lb/>and decide whether an Answer to a Question is correct or not according to a <lb/>given Text. Results were evaluated against the QA human assessments. <lb/>• the Question Answering on Speech Transcripts (QAST) [3,14]: which contin-<lb/>ued last year&apos;s successful pilot task, aimed at providing a framework in which <lb/>QA systems could be evaluated when the answers to factual and definition <lb/>questions must be extracted from spontaneous speech transcriptions. <lb/>• the Word Sense Disambiguation for Question Answering (QA-WSD) [4], a pi-<lb/>lot task which provided the questions and collections with already disambi-<lb/>guated Word Senses in order to study their contribution to QA performance. <lb/>As far as the main task is concerned, following last year experience, the exer-<lb/>cise consisted of topic-related questions, i.e. clusters of questions which were re-<lb/>lated to the same topic and contained co-references between one question and the <lb/>others. The requirement for questions related to a topic necessarily implies that the <lb/>questions refer to common concepts and entities within the domain in question. <lb/>This is accomplished either by co-reference or by anaphoric reference to the topic, <lb/>implicit or explicitly expressed in the first question or in its answer. <lb/>Moreover, besides the usual news collections provided by ELRA/ELDA, arti-<lb/>cles from Wikipedia were considered as an answer source. Some questions could <lb/>have answers only in one collection, i.e. either only in the news corpus or in <lb/>Wikipedia. <lb/>As a general remark, this year we had the same number of participants as in <lb/>2007 campaign, but the number of submissions went up. Due to the complexity of <lb/>the innovation introduced in 2007 -the introduction of topics and anaphora, list <lb/>questions, Wikipedia corpus -the questions tended to get a lot more difficult and <lb/>the performance of systems dropped dramatically, so, people were disinclined to <lb/></body>

			<body>continue the following year (i.e. 2008), inverting the positive trend in participation <lb/>registered in the previous campaigns. <lb/>As reflected in the results, the task proved to be even more difficult than ex-<lb/>pected. Results improved in the monolingual subtasks but are still very low in the <lb/>cross-lingual subtasks. <lb/>This paper describes the preparation process and presents the results of the QA <lb/>track at CLEF 2008. In section 2, the tasks of the track are described in detail. The <lb/>results are reported in section 3. In section 4, some final analysis about this cam-<lb/>paign is given. <lb/>2 Task Description <lb/>As far as the main task is concerned, the consolidated procedure was followed, <lb/>capitalizing on the experience of the task proposed in 2007. <lb/>The exercise consisted of topic-related questions, i.e. clusters of questions <lb/>which were related to the same topic and contained co-references between one <lb/>question and the others. Neither the question types (F, D, L) nor the topics were <lb/>given to the participants. <lb/>The systems were fed with a set of 200 questions -which could concern facts or <lb/>events (F-actoid questions), definitions of people, things or organisations (D-<lb/>efinition questions), or lists of people, objects or data (L-ist questions)-and were <lb/>asked to return up to three exact answers per question, where exact meant that nei-<lb/>ther more nor less than the information required was given. <lb/>The answer needed to be supported by the docid of the document in which the <lb/>exact answer was found, and by portion(s) of text, which provided enough context <lb/>to support the correctness of the exact answer. Supporting texts could be taken <lb/>from different sections of the relevant documents, and could sum up to a maxi-<lb/>mum of 700 bytes. There were no particular restrictions on the length of an an-<lb/>swer-string, but unnecessary pieces of information were penalized, since the an-<lb/>swer was marked as ineXact. As in previous years, the exact answer could be <lb/>exactly copied and pasted from the document, even if it was grammatically incor-<lb/>rect (e.g.: inflectional case did not match the one required by the question). Any-<lb/>way, systems were also allowed to use natural language generation in order to cor-<lb/>rect morpho-syntactical inconsistencies (e.g., in German, changing dem <lb/>Presidenten into der President if the question implies that the answer is in nomi-<lb/>native case), and to introduce grammatical and lexical changes (e.g., QUESTION: <lb/>What nationality is X? TEXT: X is from the Netherlands EXACT ANSWER: <lb/>Dutch). <lb/>The subtasks were both: <lb/>• monolingual, where the language of the question (Source language) and <lb/>the language of the news collection (Target language) were the same; <lb/></body>

			<body>• cross-lingual, where the questions were formulated in a language differ-<lb/>ent from that of the news collection. <lb/>Two new languages have been added, i.e. Basque and Greek both as source <lb/>and target languages. In total eleven source languages were considered, <lb/>namely, Basque, Bulgarian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, <lb/>Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish. All these languages were also considered <lb/>as target languages. <lb/>Table 1. Tasks activated in 2008 (coloured cells) <lb/>TARGET LANGUAGES (corpus and answers) <lb/>BG <lb/>DE <lb/>EL <lb/>EN <lb/>ES <lb/>EU FR <lb/>IT <lb/>NL <lb/>PT <lb/>RO <lb/>SOURCE LANGUAGES <lb/>(questions) <lb/>BG <lb/>DE <lb/>EL <lb/>EN <lb/>ES <lb/>EU <lb/>FR <lb/>IT <lb/>NL <lb/>PT <lb/>RO <lb/>As shown in Table 1, 43 tasks were proposed: <lb/>• 10 Monolingual -i.e. Bulgarian (BG), German (DE), Greek (EL), Spanish <lb/>(ES), Basque (EU), French (FR), Italian (IT), Dutch (NL), Portuguese <lb/>(PT) and Romanian (RO); <lb/>• 33 Cross-lingual (as customary in recent campaigns, in order to prepare <lb/>the cross-language subtasks, for which at least one participant had regis-<lb/>tered, some target language question sets were translated into the com-<lb/>bined source languages). <lb/>Anyway, as Table 2 shows, not all the proposed tasks were then carried out by <lb/>the participants. <lb/>Table 2. Tasks chosen by at least 1 participant in QA@CLEF campaigns <lb/>MONOLINGUAL <lb/>CROSS-LINGUAL <lb/>CLEF-2004 <lb/>6 <lb/>13 <lb/>CLEF-2005 <lb/>8 <lb/>15 <lb/>CLEF-2006 <lb/>7 <lb/>17 <lb/>CLEF-2007 <lb/>7 <lb/>11 <lb/>CLEF-2008 <lb/>8 <lb/>12 <lb/>As long-established, the monolingual English (EN) task was not available as it <lb/>seems to have been already thoroughly investigated in TREC campaigns. English <lb/>was still both source and target language in the cross-language tasks. <lb/>2.1 Questions Grouped by Topic <lb/>The procedure followed to prepare the test set was the same as that used in the <lb/>2007 campaign. First of all, each organizing group, responsible for a target lan-<lb/>guage, freely chose a number of topics. For each topic, one to four questions were <lb/>generated. Topics could be not only named entities or events, but also other cate-<lb/>gories such as objects, natural phenomena, etc. (e.g. George W. Bush; Olympic <lb/>Games; notebooks; hurricanes; etc.). The set of ordered questions were related to <lb/>the topic as follows: <lb/>• the topic was named either in the first question or in the first answer <lb/>• the following questions could contain co-references to the topic expressed in <lb/>the first question/answer pair. <lb/>Topics were not given in the test set, but could be inferred from the first ques-<lb/>tion/answer pair. For example, if the topic was George W. Bush, the cluster of <lb/>questions related to it could have been: <lb/>Q1: Who is George W. Bush?; Q2: When was he born?; Q3: Who is his wife? <lb/>The requirement for questions related to a same topic necessarily implies that <lb/>the questions refer to common concepts and entities within the domain. The most <lb/>common form is pronominal anaphoric reference to the topic declared in the first <lb/>question, e.g.: <lb/>Q4: What is a polygraph?; Q5: When was it invented? <lb/>However, other forms of co-reference occurred in the questions. Here is an ex-<lb/>ample: <lb/>Q6: Who wrote the song &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;?; Q7: How many people were in the <lb/>group? <lb/>Here the group refers to an entity expressed not in the question but only in the <lb/>answer. However the QA system does not know this and has to infer it, a task <lb/>which can be very complex, especially if the topic is not provided in the test set. <lb/>2.2 Document collections <lb/>Beside the data collections composed of news articles provided by <lb/>ELRA/ELDA (see Table 3), also Wikipedia was considered. <lb/>The Wikipedia pages in the target languages, as found in the version of No-<lb/>vember 2006, could be used. Romanian had Wikipedia 2 as the only document col-<lb/>lection, because there was no newswire Romanian corpus. The &quot;snapshots&quot; of <lb/>Wikipedia were made available for download both in XML and HTML versions. <lb/>The answers to the questions had to be taken from actual entries or articles of <lb/>Wikipedia pages. Other types of data such as images, discussions, categories, <lb/>templates, revision histories, as well as any files with user information and meta-<lb/>information pages, had to be excluded. <lb/>One of the major reasons for using Wikipedia was to make a first step towards <lb/>web formatted corpora where to search for answers. In fact, as nowadays so large <lb/>information sources are available on the web, this may be considered a desirable <lb/>next level in the evolution of QA systems. An important advantage of Wikipedia <lb/>is that it is freely available for all languages so far considered. Anyway the varia-<lb/>tion in size of Wikipedia, depending on the language, is still problematic. <lb/>2.3 Types of Questions <lb/>As far as the question types are concerned, as in previous campaigns, the three <lb/>following categories were considered: <lb/>1. Factoid questions, fact-based questions, asking for the name of a person, a lo-<lb/>cation, the extent of something, the day on which something happened, etc. We <lb/>consider the following 8 answer types for factoids: <lb/>-PERSON, e.g.: Q8: Who was called the &quot;Iron-Chancellor&quot;? A8: Otto von <lb/>Bismarck. <lb/></body>

Definition questions, questions such as &quot;What/Who is X?&quot;, and are divided into <lb/>the following subtypes: <lb/>-PERSON, i.e., questions asking for the role/job/important information <lb/>about someone, e.g.: Q16: Who is Robert Altmann? A16: Film maker <lb/>-ORGANIZATION, i.e., questions asking for the mission/full <lb/>name/important information about an organization, e.g.: Q17: What is the <lb/>Knesset? A17: Parliament of Israel. <lb/>-OBJECT, i.e., questions asking for the description/function of objects, e.g.: <lb/>Q18: What is Atlantis? A18: Space Shuttle. <lb/>-OTHER, i.e., question asking for the description of natural phenomena, <lb/>technologies, legal procedures etc., e.g.: Q19: What is Eurovision? A19: <lb/>Song contest. <lb/>3. closed list questions: i.e., questions that require one answer containing a de-<lb/>termined number of items, e.g.: Q20: Name all the airports in London, Eng-<lb/>land. A20: Gatwick, Stansted, Heathrow, Luton and City. <lb/>As only one answer was allowed, all the items had to be present in sequence in <lb/>the document and copied, one next to the other, in the answer slot. <lb/>Besides, all types of questions could contain a temporal restriction, i.e. a tem-<lb/>poral specification that provided important information for the retrieval of the cor-<lb/>rect answer, for example: <lb/>Q21: Who was the Chancellor of Germany from 1974 to 1982? <lb/>A21: Helmut Schmidt. <lb/>Q22: Which book was published by George Orwell in 1945? <lb/>A22: Animal Farm. <lb/>Q23: Which organization did Shimon Perez chair after Isaac Rabin&apos;s <lb/>death? <lb/>A23: Labour Party Central Committee. <lb/>Some questions could have no answer in the document collection, and in that <lb/>
			case the exact answer was &quot;NIL&quot; and the answer and support docid fields were left <lb/>empty. A question was assumed to have no right answer when neither human as-<lb/>sessors nor participating systems could find one. <lb/>The distribution of the questions among these categories is described in Table 4. <lb/>Each question set was then translated into English, which worked as inter-<lb/>language during the translation of the datasets into the other tongues for the acti-<lb/>vated cross-lingual subtasks. <lb/>Table 4.

For example, the first four questions in the EN-FR test set, i.e. <lb/>English questions that hit a French document collection -were represented as fol-<lb/>lows: <lb/>&lt;input&gt; <lb/>&lt;q target_lang=&quot;FR&quot; source_lang=&quot;EN&quot; q_id=&quot;0001&quot; <lb/>q_group_id=&quot;1600&quot;&gt;Which is the largest bird in Africa?&lt;/q&gt; <lb/>&lt;q target_lang=&quot;FR&quot; source_lang=&quot;EN&quot; q_id=&quot;0002&quot; <lb/>q_group_id=&quot;1600&quot;&gt;How many species of ostriches are there?&lt;/q&gt; <lb/>&lt;q target_lang=&quot;FR&quot; source_lang=&quot;EN&quot; q_id=&quot;0003&quot; <lb/>q_group_id=&quot;1601&quot;&gt;Who served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador be-<lb/>tween 1988 and 1992?&lt;/q&gt; <lb/>&lt;q target_lang=&quot;FR&quot; source_lang=&quot;EN&quot; q_id=&quot;0004&quot; <lb/>q_group_id=&quot;1601&quot;&gt;What languages did she speak?&lt;/q&gt; <lb/>... <lb/>&lt;/input&gt; <lb/>An example of system output which answered the above questions was the <lb/>following: <lb/>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; <lb/>&lt;!DOCTYPE output SYSTEM &quot;QA-CLEF-OUTPUT.dtd&quot;&gt; <lb/>&lt;output&gt; <lb/>&lt;a q_id=&quot;0001&quot; q_group_id=&quot;1600&quot; run_id=&quot;syna081enfr&quot; score=&quot;0.000&quot;&gt; <lb/>&lt;answer&gt;version&lt;/answer&gt; <lb/>&lt;docid&gt;Afrique des Grands Lacs&lt;/docid&gt; <lb/>&lt;support&gt; <lb/>&lt;s_id&gt;Afrique des Grands Lacs&lt;/s_id&gt; <lb/>&lt;s_string&gt;Comprendre la crise de l&apos;Afrique des grands lacs -dossier <lb/>RFI (version archivée par Internet Archive).&lt;/s_string&gt; <lb/>&lt;/support&gt; <lb/>&lt;/a&gt; <lb/>&lt;a q_id=&quot;0002&quot; q_group_id=&quot;1600&quot; run_id=&quot;syna081enfr&quot; score=&quot;0.000&quot;&gt; <lb/>&lt;answer&gt;500 000&lt;/answer&gt; <lb/>&lt;docid&gt;ATS.940202.0138&lt;/docid&gt; <lb/>&lt;support&gt; <lb/>&lt;s_id&gt;ATS.940202.0138&lt;/s_id&gt; <lb/>&lt;s_string&gt;Avec une superficie de seulement 51 000 km2, le Costa Rica <lb/>abrite quelque 500 000 espèces végétales et animales.

Human judges assessed the exact answer (i.e. the shortest <lb/>string of words which is supposed to provide the exact amount of information to <lb/>answer the question) as: <lb/>• R (Right) if correct; <lb/>• W (Wrong) if incorrect; <lb/>• X (ineXact) if contained less or more information than that required by <lb/>the query; <lb/>• U (Unsupported) if either the docid was missing or wrong, or the sup-<lb/>porting snippet did not contain the exact answer. <lb/>Most assessor-groups managed to guarantee a second judgement of all the runs. <lb/>As regards the evaluation measures, the main one was accuracy, defined as the <lb/>average of SCORE(q) over all 200 questions q, where SCORE(q) is 1 in the first <lb/>answer to q in the submission file is assessed as R, and 0 otherwise. <lb/>In addition most assessor groups computed the following measures: <lb/>• Confident Weighted Score (CWS). Answers are in a decreasing order of <lb/>confidence and CWS rewards systems that give correct answers at the top <lb/>of the ranking [16] <lb/>• the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) over N assessed answers per question <lb/>(to consider the three answers). That is, the mean of the reciprocal of the <lb/>rank of the first correct label over all questions. If the first correct label is <lb/>ranked as the 3rd label, then the reciprocal rank (RR) is 1/3. If none of <lb/>the first N responses contains a correct label, RR is 0. RR is 1 if the high-<lb/>est ranked label matches the correct label. <lb/>3 Results <lb/>As far as accuracy is concerned, scores were generally far lower than usual, as <lb/>Figure 1 shows. Although comparison between different languages and years is <lb/>not possible, in Figure 1 we can observe some trends which characterized this <lb/>year&apos;s competition: best accuracy in the monolingual task increased with respect <lb/>to last year, going up again to the values recorded in 2006. But systems -even <lb/>those that participated in all previous campaigns -did not achieve a brilliant over-<lb/>all performance. Apparently systems could not manage suitably the new chal-<lb/>lenges, although they improved their performances when tackling issues already <lb/>treated in previous campaigns. <lb/>More in detail, best accuracy in the monolingual task scored 63,5 almost ten <lb/>points up with respect to last year, meanwhile the overall performance of the sys-<lb/>tems was quite low, as average accuracy was 23,63, practically the same as last <lb/>year. On the contrary, the performances in the cross-language tasks recorded a <lb/>drastic drop: best accuracy reached only 19% compared to 41,75% in the previous <lb/>year, which means more than 20 points lower, meanwhile average accuracy was <lb/>more or less the same as in 2007 -13,24 compared to 10,9. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>Mono <lb/>Bilingual <lb/>Mono <lb/>Bilingual <lb/>Mono <lb/>Bilingual <lb/>Mono <lb/>Bilingual <lb/>Mono <lb/>Biligual <lb/>Mono <lb/>

As noticed, this is probably the consequence of the new challenges introduced <lb/>last year in the exercise. <lb/>Also the geographical distribution remained almost unchanged, even though <lb/>there was no participation from Australia and Asia. No runs were submitted nei-<lb/>ther for Italian or Greek tasks. <lb/>Anyway, the number of submitted runs, increased from a total of 37 registered last <lb/>year to 51 (see Table 6). The breakdown of participants and runs, according to <lb/>language, is shown in Table 4 (Section 2.3). As in previous campaigns, more par-<lb/>ticipants chose the monolingual tasks, which once again demonstrated to be more <lb/>approachable. <lb/>Table 6.

They sent four runs: one mono-<lb/>lingual, one English-Basque and two Spanish-Basque. <lb/>The Basque question set consisted of 145 factoid questions, 39 definition ques-<lb/>tions and 16 list questions. 39 questions contained a temporal restriction, and 10 <lb/>had no answer in the Gold Standard. 40 answers were retrieved from Wikipedia, <lb/>the remains from the news collections. Half of the questions were linked to a top-<lb/>ic, so the second (and sometimes the 3rd) question was more difficult to answer. <lb/>The news were from the Egunkaria newspaper during 2000, 2001 and 2002 <lb/>years and the information from Wikipedia was the exportation corresponding to <lb/>the 2006 year. <lb/>Table 7 shows the evaluation results for the four submitted runs (one monolin-<lb/>gual and three cross-lingual). The table shows the number of Right, Wrong, in-<lb/>eXact and Unsupported answers, as well as the percentage of correctly answered <lb/>Factoids, Temporally restricted questions, Definition and List questions. <lb/>Table 7. Evaluation results for the four submitted runs. <lb/>Run <lb/>R <lb/># <lb/>W <lb/># <lb/>X <lb/># <lb/>U <lb/># <lb/>%F <lb/>[145] <lb/>%T <lb/>[23] <lb/>%D <lb/>[39] <lb/>L% <lb/>[16] <lb/>NIL <lb/>CWS <lb/>Over-<lb/>all <lb/>accu-<lb/>racy <lb/># <lb/>% <lb/>[*] <lb/>ixag08 <lb/>1eueu <lb/>26 <lb/>163 <lb/>11 <lb/>0 <lb/>15.9 <lb/>8.7 <lb/>7.7 <lb/>0 <lb/>4 <lb/>7.0 <lb/>0.023 <lb/>13 <lb/>ixag08 <lb/>1eneu <lb/>11 <lb/>182 <lb/>7 <lb/>0 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>7.7 <lb/>0 <lb/>6 <lb/>6.2 <lb/>0.004 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>ixag08 <lb/>1eseu <lb/>11 <lb/>182 <lb/>7 <lb/>0 <lb/>6.9 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>2.6 <lb/>0 <lb/>4 <lb/>4.8 <lb/>0.004 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>ixag08 <lb/>2eseu <lb/>7 <lb/>185 <lb/>8 <lb/>0 <lb/>4.8 <lb/>4.3 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>3 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>0.003 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>The monolingual run (ixag081eueu.xml) achieved accuracy of 13%, lower than <lb/>the most systems for other target languages during the evaluation of 2007 but bet-<lb/>ter than some of them. It is necessary to underline that Basque is a highly flexional <lb/>language, doing matching of term and entities more complex, and that ir is the first <lb/>participation. The system achieved better accuracy in factoids questions (15.9%). <lb/>No correct answers was retrieved for list questions. It is necessary to remark that <lb/>57 answers were NIL (only four of them were corrects), perhaps participants can <lb/>improve this aspect. <lb/>Looking to the cross-lingual runs the loss of accuracy respect to the monolin-<lb/>gual system is a bit more than 50% for the two best runs. This percentage is quite <lb/>similar with runs for other target languages in 2007. The overall accuracy is the <lb/>same for both (English and Spanish to Basque) but only they agree in five correct <lb/>answers (each system gives other six correct answers). The second system for <lb/>Spanish-Basque get poorer results and only is slightly better in inexact answers. <lb/>
			These runs get also a lot of NIL answers. <lb/>3.3 Bulgarian as Target <lb/>Table 8.

As the table above shows, the result is far <lb/>from satisfying. Again, the definitions were detected better in comparison to other <lb/>question types. Also, the difference between the detection of factoids and of tem-<lb/>porally restricted questions is negligible. The results from the previous years de-<lb/>creased in both directions -as participating groups and as system performance. <lb/>3.4 Dutch as Target <lb/>The questions for the Dutch subtask of CLEF-QA 2008 were written by four <lb/>native speakers. They selected random articles from either Wikipedia or the news <lb/>collection and composed questions based on the topics of the articles. <lb/>Table 9.

An overview of the question types and answer types can be found in Ta-<lb/>ble 9. <lb/>This year, only one team took part in the question answering task with Dutch as <lb/>target language: the University of Groningen. The team submitted two monolin-<lb/>gual runs and two cross-lingual runs (English to Dutch). All runs were assessed <lb/>twice by a single assessor. This resulted in a total of eight conflicts (1%). These <lb/>were corrected. The results of the assessment can be found in Table 10. <lb/>Table 10. Assessment results for the four submitted runs for Dutch. <lb/>Run <lb/>R <lb/># <lb/>W <lb/># <lb/>X <lb/># <lb/>U <lb/># <lb/>%F <lb/>[151] <lb/>%T <lb/>[13] <lb/>%D <lb/>[39] <lb/>L% <lb/>[10] <lb/>NIL <lb/>CWS <lb/>Over-<lb/>all <lb/>accu-<lb/>racy <lb/># <lb/>% <lb/>[*] <lb/>gron0 <lb/>81nlnl <lb/>50 <lb/>138 <lb/>11 <lb/>1 <lb/>24.5 <lb/>15.4 <lb/>33.3 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>19 <lb/>5.3 <lb/>0.342 <lb/>25.0 <lb/>gron0 <lb/>82nlnl <lb/>51 <lb/>136 <lb/>10 <lb/>3 <lb/>24.5 <lb/>15.4 <lb/>35.9 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>15 <lb/>6.7 <lb/>0.331 <lb/>25.5 <lb/>gron0 <lb/>81ennl <lb/>27 <lb/>157 <lb/>10 <lb/>6 <lb/>13.2 <lb/>7.7 <lb/>17.9 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>30 <lb/>3.3 <lb/>0.235 <lb/>13.5 <lb/>gron0 <lb/>82ennl <lb/>27 <lb/>157 <lb/>10 <lb/>6 <lb/>13.2 <lb/>7.7 <lb/>17.9 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>30 <lb/>3.3 <lb/>0.235 <lb/>13.5 <lb/>The two cross-lingual runs gron081ennl andron082ennl produced exactly the <lb/>same answers. <lb/>The best monolingual run (gron082nlnl) achieved exactly the same score as the <lb/>best run of 2007 (25.5%). The same is true for the best monolingual run (13.5%). <lb/>The fact that the two scores are in the same range as last year is no big surprise <lb/>since the task has not changed considerably this year and all scores have been <lb/>achieved by the same system. <lb/>Like in 2007, the system performed better for definition questions than for oth-<lb/>er question types. The definition questions could be divided in two subtypes: those <lb/>that asked for a definition (26) and those that contained a definition and asked for <lb/>the name of the defined object (12). The monolingual runs performed similarly for <lb/>both subtypes but the cross-lingual runs did not contain a correct answer to any <lb/>question of the second subtype. <lb/>None of the runs obtained any points for the list questions. The answers con-<lb/>tained some parts that were correct but none of them were completely correct. We <lb/>were unable to award points for partially correct answers in the current assessment <lb/>scheme. <lb/>All the runs were produced by the same system and the differences between the <lb/>runs are small. The cross-lingual runs contained seven correct answers that were <lb/>not present in any of the monolingual runs (for questions 20, 25, 120, 131, 142, <lb/>150 and 200). Eight questions were only answered correctly in a single monolin-<lb/>gual run (1, 28, 54, 72, 83, 143, 193 and 199). Thirty-five questions were ans-<lb/>wered correctly in two runs, three in three runs and seventeen in all four runs. 137 <lb/>questions failed to receive any correct answer. <lb/>3.5 English as Target <lb/>Table 11.

The task this year was exactly the same as in 2007 and <lb/>moreover the three collections were the same: Glasgow Herald, LA Times and <lb/>Wikipedia. However, given the considerable interest in the Wikipedia which has <lb/>been shown by Question Answering groups generally, it was decided to increase <lb/>the number of questions drawn from it to 75% overall, with just 25% coming from <lb/>the two newspaper collections. This means that 40 of the 160 Factoids came from <lb/>the newspapers, together with seven of the 30 Definitions and two of the ten Lists. <lb/>These questions were divided equally between the Glasgow Herald and LA Times. <lb/>All the remainder we drawn from the Wikipedia. <lb/>Considerable care was taken in the selection of the questions. The distribution <lb/>by answer type was controlled exactly as in previous years. As requested by the <lb/>organisers there were exactly twenty each of Factoid target type PERSON, TIME, <lb/>
			LOCATION, MEASURE, COUNT, ORGANIZATION, OBJECT and OTHER. <lb/>Similarly for Definitions there were eight PERSON, seven ORGANIZATION, <lb/>seven OBJECT and eight OTHER. For Lists there were four OTHER, two each of <lb/>PERSON and ORGANIZATION, and one each of LOCATION and OBJECT. <lb/>In addition to the above distribution, we also controlled the distribution of top-<lb/>ics for the question groups, something which was made practicable by the use of <lb/>the Wikipedia. Questions were drawn from a number of predefined subject fields: <lb/>countries towns, roads and bridges, shops, politicians and politics, sports and <lb/>sports people, foods and vegetables, cars, classical music including instruments, <lb/>popular music, literature poetry and drama, philosophy, films, architecture, lan-<lb/>guages, science, consumer goods, and finally organisations. Questions were distri-<lb/>buted among these topics. The maximum in any topic was twenty (sports) and the <lb/>minimum was two (shops). For the majority there were between four and six ques-<lb/>tion groups. For each such topic, one or more questions were set depending on <lb/>what information the texts contained. As a change from last year, the organisers <lb/>asked us to include 100 singleton topics. This effectively meant that half the ques-<lb/>tions in the overall set of 200 were simple &quot;one-off&quot; queries as were set in CLEF <lb/>prior to 2007 and for the earlier TREC campaigns. <lb/>Questions were entered via a web interface developed by the organisers last <lb/>year. However, this year they improved it considerably, for example allowing <lb/>modifications to be made to existing entries. This was a great help and a com-<lb/>mendable effort on their part. <lb/>Summary Statistics. Five cross-lingual runs with English as target were sub-<lb/>mitted this year, as compared with eight in 2007 and thirteen in 2006. Four groups <lb/>participated in three languages, Dutch, German and Romanian. Each group <lb/>worked with only one source language, and only DCUN submitted two runs. The <lb/>rest submitted only one run. <lb/>Assessment Procedure. Last year we used the excellent Web-based assess-<lb/>ment system developed originally for the QiQA task by University of Amsterdam. <lb/>However, we were asked not to use this in 2008 because it only allows one answer <lb/>per question per system to be assessed and it was required to assess multiple an-<lb/>swers per question per system. For this reason we used a Web-based tool devel-<lb/>oped by UNED in Madrid. <lb/>All answers were double-judged. Where the assessors differed, the case was re-<lb/>viewed and a decision taken. There were 63 judgement differences in total. Three <lb/>of the runs contained multiple answers to individual questions in certain cases, and <lb/>these were all assessed, as per the requirement of the organisers. If we assume that <lb/>the number of judgements was in fact 200 questions * five runs, i.e. 1,000, we can <lb/>compute a lower bound for the agreement level. This gives a figure of (1,000-<lb/>63)/1,000, i.e. 93.7%. The equivalent figure for 2007 (called Agreement Level 2 in <lb/>the Working Notes for last year) was 97.6%. Given that we have computed a low-<lb/>er bound this year (and not therefore the exact figure) this seems acceptable. <lb/>Results Analysis. Of the five runs with English as target, wlvs081roen was the <lb/>best with an accuracy of 19.00% overall. They also did very will on the defini-<lb/>tions, scoring 66.67%. The only source language for which there was more than <lb/>one run was German, for which there were three submissions from two groups. <lb/>dfki081 scored the best with 14.00% and this was followed by dcun081deen with <lb/>8.00% and dcun082deen with 0.50%. dfki also did very well on definitions with <lb/>an accuracy of 60.00. Interestingly, none of the systems answered any of the list <lb/>questions correctly. Only dcun082deen answered one list question inexactly. <lb/>If we compare the results this year with those of last year when the task was <lb/>very similar, performance has improved here. The best score in 2007 was <lb/>wolv071roen with 14.00% (the best score) which has now improved to 19.00%. <lb/>Similarly, dfki071deen scored 7.00% in 2007 but increased this to 14.00% this <lb/>year in dfki081deen. An attempt was made to set easier questions this year, which <lb/>might have affected performance. In addition, many more questions came from <lb/>the Wikipedia in 2008 with only a minority being drawn from the newspaper cor-<lb/>pora. <lb/>3.6 QA-WSD subtask <lb/>The QA-WSD task brings semantic and retrieval evaluation together. The par-<lb/>ticipants were offered the same queries and document collections as for the main <lb/>QA exercise, but with the addition of word sense tags as provided by two automat-<lb/>ic word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems. Contrary to the main QA task, Wi-<lb/>kipedia articles are not included, and thus systems need to reply to the questions <lb/>that have an answer in the news document collection. The goal of the task is to test <lb/>whether WSD can be used beneficially for Question Answering, and is closely re-<lb/>lated to the Robust-WSD subtask of the ad-hoc track in CLEF 2008. <lb/>The exercise scenario is event-targeted QA on a news document collection. In the <lb/>QA-WSD track only English monolingual and Spanish to English bilingual tasks <lb/>are offered, i.e. English is the only target language, and queries are available on <lb/>both English and Spanish. The queries were the same as for the main QA exercise, <lb/>and the participation followed the same process, except for the use of the sense-<lb/>annotated data. <lb/>The goal of this task is to evaluate whether word sense information can help in <lb/>certain queries. For this reason, participants were required to send two runs for <lb/>each of the monolingual/bilingual tasks where they participate: one which does <lb/>not use sense annotations and another one which does use sense annotations. <lb/>Whenever possible, the only difference between the two runs should be solely the <lb/>use or not of the sense information. Participants which send a single run would be <lb/>discarded from the evaluation. <lb/>

			The WSD data is based on WordNet version 1.6 and was supplemented with free-<lb/>ly available data from the English and Spanish WordNets in order to test different <lb/>expansion strategies. Two leading WSD experts run their systems [17][18], and <lb/>provided those WSD results for the participants to use. <lb/>The task website [4] provides additional information on data formats and re-<lb/>sources. <lb/>Results <lb/>From the 200 questions provided to participants, only 49 queries had a correct <lb/>answer in the news collection. The table below provides the results for the partici-<lb/>pant on those 49 questions. <lb/>Table 12.

For the sake of completeness we also include below the results on all <lb/>200 queries. Surprisingly the participant managed to find two (one in the WSD <lb/>run) correct answer for the Wikipedia questions in the news collection. <lb/>Table 13.

Last year&apos;s second <lb/>participant, the Language Computer Corporation (LCC, USA) didn&apos;t send any <lb/>submission this time. <lb/>Synapse submitted three runs in total: <lb/>• one monolingual run: French to French (FR-to-FR), <lb/>• two bilingual runs: English-to-French (EN-to-FR) and Portuguese-to-<lb/>French (PT-to-FR). <lb/>In the following, these will be referred to as: <lb/>• syn08frfr <lb/>(for FR-to-FR), <lb/>• syn08enfr (for EN-to-FR), <lb/>• syn08ptfr (for PT-to-FR). <lb/>As last year, three types of questions were proposed: factual, definition and <lb/>closed list questions. Participants could return one exact answer per question and <lb/>up to two runs. Some questions (10%) had no answer in the document collection, <lb/>and in this case the exact answer is &quot;NIL&quot;. <lb/>The French test set consists of 200 questions: <lb/>• 135 Factual (F), <lb/>• 30 Definition (D), <lb/>• 35 closed List questions (L). <lb/>Among these 200 questions, 66 were temporally restricted questions (T) and 12 <lb/>were NIL questions (i.e. a &quot;NIL&quot; answer was expected, meaning that there is no <lb/>valid answer for this question in the document collection). <lb/>Table 14.

For each run, the following statistics are provided: <lb/>• The number of correct (R), wrong (W), inexact (X) and unsupported <lb/>answers (U), <lb/>• The accuracy calculated within each of the categories of questions: <lb/>F, D, T and L questions, <lb/>• The number of NIL answers and the proportion of correct ones (i.e. <lb/>corresponding to a NIL questions), <lb/>• The Confidence Weighted Score (CWS) measure. <lb/>• The accuracy calculated over all answers. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the best scores for systems using French as target in the last <lb/>five CLEF QA campaigns. <lb/>Figure 2: Best scores for systems using French as target in CLEF QA campaigns <lb/>For the monolingual task, the Synapse system returned 113 correct answers <lb/>(accuracy of 56.5%), slightly more than last year (accuracy of 54.0%). The bilin-<lb/>gual runs performance is quite low, with an accuracy of 18.0% for EN-to-FR and <lb/>16.5% for PT-to-FR. It cannot be fairly compared to the results of CLEF2007, be-<lb/>cause Synapse didn&apos;t submit bilingual runs last year. Last year, LCC obtained an <lb/>accuracy of 41.7% for EN-to-FR, but did not submit anything this year. <lb/>It appears that the level of performance strongly depends on the type of ques-<lb/>tions. The monolingual run scores very high on the definition questions (86.7%). <lb/>The lowest performance is obtained with closed list questions (37.1%). <lb/>It is even more obvious when looking at the bilingual runs. If the systems per-<lb/>formed pretty well on the definition questions (50.0% and 43.3% for EN-to-FR <lb/>and PT-to-FR respectively), they could not cope with the closed list questions. The <lb/>PT-to-FR system could only give one close list correct answer. The EN-to-FR sys-<lb/>tem could not even answer to any of these questions. The bilingual runs did not <lb/>reach high accuracy with factoid and temporally restricted questions (50.0% and <lb/>43.3% for EN-to-FR and PT-to-FR respectively). This year, the complexity of the <lb/>task, in particular regarding closed list questions, seems to have been hard to cope <lb/>with for the bilingual systems. <lb/>The complexity of the task is also reflected by the number of NIL answers. The <lb/>monolingual system returned 20 NIL answers (to be compared with the 12 ex-<lb/>pected). The bilingual systems returned 60 (EN-to-FR) and 67 (EN-to-FR) NIL <lb/>answers, i.e. at least 5 times more as expected. <lb/>

			It is also interesting to look at the results when categorizing questions by the <lb/>size of the topic they belong to. This year, topics could contain from 1 single ques-<lb/>tion to 4 questions. The CLEF 2008 set consists of: <lb/>• 52 single question topics, <lb/>• 33 topics with 2 questions (66 questions in total), <lb/>• 18 topics with 3 questions (54 questions in total), <lb/>• 7 topics with 4 questions (28 questions in total). <lb/>Table 15, Table 16 and Table 17 give the results of each run according to the <lb/>size of the topics. <lb/>Table 15. Results per topic size (FR-to-FR) <lb/>Run <lb/>Size of topic <lb/>Assessed <lb/>Answers # <lb/>Overall accuracy <lb/>(%) <lb/>syn08frfr <lb/>1 <lb/>52 <lb/>55.8 <lb/>syn08frfr <lb/>2 <lb/>66 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>syn08frfr <lb/>3 <lb/>24 <lb/>66.7 <lb/>syn08frfr <lb/>4 <lb/>28 <lb/>53.6 <lb/>Table 16.

On the opposite, the performances of the bilingual systems (Table 16 <lb/>and Table 17) decrease by a half, when comparing the 1-and 2-question sets to the <lb/>3-and 4-question sets. A possible explanation is that the bilingual systems per-<lb/>form poorly with questions containing anaphoric references (which are more <lb/>likely to occur in the 3-and 4-question sets). <lb/>In conclusion, there was unfortunately only one participant this year. In particu-<lb/>lar; it would have been interesting to see how the LCC group, which submitted a <lb/>bilingual run last year, would have performed this year. <lb/>This decrease in participation can be explained by the discouragement of some <lb/>participants. Some have complained that the task is each year harder (e.g. this <lb/>year, there were more closed list questions and anaphoric references than last <lb/>year) that can result in a decrease in the systems performances. <lb/>This year, the number and complexity of closed list questions was clearly <lb/>higher than the previous year. In the same way, there were more temporally re-<lb/>stricted questions, more topics (comprising from 2 to 4 questions) and more ana-<lb/>phoric references. It seems that this higher level of difficulty particularly impacted <lb/>the bilingual tasks. In spite of this, the monolingual Synapse system performed <lb/>slightly better than last year. <lb/>3.8 German as Target <lb/>Three research groups submitted runs for evaluation in the track having Ger-<lb/>man as target language: The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence <lb/>(DFKI), the Fern Universität Hagen (FUHA) and the Universität Koblenz-Landau <lb/>(LOGA). All groups provided system runs for the monolingual scenario, DFKI <lb/>and FUHA submitted runs for the cross-language English-German scenario and <lb/>FUHA had also runs for the Spanish-German scenario. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2004 <lb/>Best Mono <lb/>Aggregated <lb/>Mono <lb/>Figure 3.

			According to Table 19 the most frequent topic types were OTHER (32), OBJECT <lb/>(29) and ORGANIZATION (24), with first two types more present for the <lb/>Wikipedia collection of documents (WIKI). <lb/>As regards the source of the answers, 97 questions from 57 topics asked for <lb/>information out of the CLEF document collection and the rest of 103 from 63 top-<lb/>ics for information from Wikipedia. Table 20 shows a breakdown of the test set <lb/>questions by the expected answer type (EAType) for each collection of data. <lb/>3.9 Portuguese as Target <lb/>The Portuguese track had six different participants: beside the veteran groups <lb/>of Priberam, Linguateca, Universidade de Évora, INESC and FEUP, we had a new <lb/>participants this year, Universidade Aberta. No bilingual task occurred this year. <lb/>In this fourth year of Portuguese participation, Priberam repeated the top place <lb/>of its previous years, with University of Évora behind. Again we added the classi-<lb/>fication the classification X-, meaning incomplete, keeping the classification X+ <lb/>for answers with extra text or other kinds of inexactness.

Therefore, we accepted both NIL answers to those ques-<lb/>tions, as well as correct ones. <lb/>

			Table 24 shows the results for each answer type of definition questions, while <lb/>Table 25 shows the results for each answer type of factoid questions (including list <lb/>questions).

			<body>As the Guidelines for Question Generation did not change since the previous edi-<lb/>tion, there were no major difficulties in creating the Romanian gold standard for <lb/>the 2008 QA@CLEF. The working version of the GS was uploaded on the ques-<lb/>tion generation interface developed at CELCT (Italy), by filling all the required <lb/>fields. <lb/>For the topic-related questions (clusters of up to four questions, related to one <lb/>same topic) we kept about the same number as in the previous edition: in 2007 we <lb/>had 122 topics and now there are 119 topics. The percentage of topic-linked ques-<lb/>tions is illustrated in Table 30, showing that 127 questions were grouped under 46 <lb/>topics, hence 63.5% out of the total 200 questions were linked in topics with more <lb/>than one question. <lb/>Table 30. Topic-related questions <lb/># of questions <lb/>/ Topic type <lb/>PERSO <lb/>N <lb/>LOC. <lb/>ORG. <lb/>EVEN <lb/>T <lb/>OBJE <lb/>CT <lb/>OTHE <lb/>R <lb/>Total <lb/>topics <lb/>Total <lb/>ques-<lb/>tions <lb/>4 Qs <lb/>5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>5 <lb/>12 <lb/>48 <lb/>3 Qs <lb/>5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>11 <lb/>33 <lb/>2 Qs <lb/>5 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>2 <lb/>9 <lb/>23 <lb/>46 <lb/>1 Q <lb/>13 <lb/>6 <lb/>19 <lb/>17 <lb/>18 <lb/>73 <lb/>73 <lb/>TOTAL <lb/>28 <lb/>11 <lb/>24 <lb/>1 <lb/>20 <lb/>35 <lb/>119 <lb/>200 <lb/>In fact the questions contain not 127, but only 51 anaphoric elements of various <lb/>types, so that 25.5% of the questions are linked through coreferential relations. <lb/>The personal, possessive or demonstrative pronouns were used in most of the cas-<lb/>es to create anaphoric relations. The antecedents are mainly the focus of the pre-<lb/>vious question, or the previous answer. Few such questions require inference in <lb/>order to be correctly answered. For example in order to correctly answer the F-<lb/>Time question When was the first Esperanto dictionary for Romanian published? <lb/>and then the L-Other Name all the grammatical cases of this artificial language., <lb/>one needs to correctly link the anaphor &quot;artificial language&quot; to its antecedent <lb/>which is &quot;Esperanto&quot; and not &quot;Romanian&quot; (also a language but not artificial); this <lb/>is possible by establishing, based on a text snippet, that Esperanto is an artificial <lb/>language. <lb/>The 8 NIL questions, even though they seem somehow unnatural, were created <lb/>by including questions about facts impossible from a human perception; for ex-<lb/>ample the question In which year did Paul Kline publish his work about the natu-<lb/>ral phenomena called hail? has no answer in any of the articles about the psychol-<lb/>ogist. Another type of NIL questions are those based on inference -the question <lb/>How many bicameral Parliaments are there in Cuba? is a NIL question because <lb/>in all wiki articles one can find that Cuba has a unicameral parliament. Another <lb/>type of NIL questions (with answer in English, but not in Romanian) we have <lb/>created cannot be good items neither in a cross-lingual evaluation where the an-<lb/>swers are to be find in any language, nor in an evaluation based on an open text <lb/>collection such as the web. The question What is a micron? has no answer in the <lb/>Romanian wiki articles from 2006, but it can have an answer in other Romanian <lb/>webpages, and, moreover, in the English wiki articles it has more than a correct <lb/>answer depending on the domain where the term is used (in the metric system or <lb/>in vacuum engineering). <lb/>For the LIST type we created only questions whose answers are to be found in <lb/>one same text section. The 2007 evaluation for Romanian showed that &quot;open list&quot; <lb/>questions (with answers in various sections of an article or even in various ar-<lb/>ticles) are difficult to handle, therefore we made the LIST questions easier. <lb/>Systems&apos; analysis and evaluation. Like in the 2007 edition, this year two Roma-<lb/>nian groups took part in the monolingual task with Romanian as a target language: <lb/>the Faculty of Computer Science from the Al. I. Cuza University of Iasi (UAIC), <lb/>
			and the Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence from the Romanian Academy <lb/>(ICIA), Bucharest. Each group submitted two runs, the four systems having an av-<lb/>erage of 2.4 answers per question for ICIA, and 1.92 for UAIC. The 2008 general <lb/>results are presented in Tables 31 below. <lb/>The statistics includes a system, named combined, obtained through the combina-<lb/>tion of the 4 participating RO-RO systems. Because at the evaluation time we ob-<lb/>served that there are correct answers not only in the first position, but also on the <lb/>second or the third, the combined system considers that an answer is R if there ex-<lb/>ists at least one R answer among all the answers returned by the four systems. If <lb/>there is no R answer, the same strategy is applied to X, U and finally W answers. <lb/>This &quot;ideal&quot; system permits to calculate the percentage of the questions (and their <lb/>type), answered by at least one of the four systems in any of the maximum 3 an-<lb/>swers returned for a question. <lb/>All three systems crashed on the LIST questions. The best results were obtained <lb/>by ICIA for DEFINITION questions, whereas UAIC performed best with the <lb/>FACTOID questions. The combined system suggests that a joint system, devel-<lb/>oped by both groups, would improve substantially the general results for Roma-<lb/>nian. <lb/>Using in a first stage the web interface for assessing the QA runs, developed at <lb/>UNED in Spain, the assessment took into consideration one question with all its <lb/>answers at the time, assuring that the same evaluation criteria are applied to all an-<lb/>swers. The judgment of the answers was based on the same Guidelines as in 2007, <lb/>therefore we kept the same criteria as in 2007, in order to assure consistency in-<lb/>side the Romanian language, which gives also the possibility to evaluate the sys-<lb/>tems in their evolution from one year to another. For example, one could easily <lb/>see that the UAIC systems had most of the answers for the DEFINITION ques-<lb/>tions evaluated as ineXact, because the answers were judged as being &quot;longer than <lb/>the minimum amount of information required&quot; and hence &quot;unnecessary pieces of <lb/>information were penalized&quot;. Since all the 2007 and 2008 answers were evaluated <lb/>this way, we considered it is more important to have uniformly applied rules in-<lb/>side one language than to change the evaluation in order to be consistent across <lb/>languages. On the other hand the ICIA answers judged as ineXact are due to an-<lb/>swers that are too long, snippets shortened as such as they do not contain the an-<lb/>swer, or because the answer and the snippet has no connections. <lb/>Tables 31.

In <lb/>fact, last year the task was changed considerably and this affected the general level <lb/>of results and also the level of participation in the QA task. This year participation <lb/>increased slightly but the task proved to be still very difficult. Wikipedia increased <lb/>its presence as a source of questions and answers. Following last year&apos;s conclu-<lb/>sions Wikipedia seemed to be a good source for finding answers to simple factoid <lb/>questions. <lb/>Moreover, the overall decrease in accuracy was probably due to linked ques-<lb/>tions. This fact confirms that topic resolution is a weak point for QA systems. <lb/>Only 5 out of 11 target languages had more than one different participating <lb/>group. Thus from the evaluation methodology perspective, a comparison between <lb/>systems working under similar circumstances cannot be accomplished and this <lb/>impedes one of the major goals of campaigns such the QA@CLEF, i.e. the sys-<lb/>tems comparison which could determine an improvement in approaching QA <lb/>problematic issues. <lb/>In six years of QA experimentation, a lot of resources and know-how have <lb/>been accumulated, nevertheless systems do not show a brilliant overall perfor-<lb/>mance, even those that have participated to most QA campaigns, and still seem <lb/>not to manage suitably the different challenges proposed. <lb/>In conclusion, it is clear that a redefinition of the task should be thought in the <lb/>next campaign. This new definition of the task should permit the evaluation and <lb/>comparison of systems even working in different languages. The new setting <lb/>should also take as reference a real user scenario, perhaps in a new document col-<lb/>lection. <lb/></body>
