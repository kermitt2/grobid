			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The measurement of electroweak boson properties in CMS [1] <lb/>and ATLAS [2] is of capital importance, especially in the <lb/>first years of operation of the LHC. These measurements <lb/>are useful to test the Standard Model (SM) at a new en-<lb/>ergy scale, to improve our knowledge on the proton com-<lb/>position. They are also sensitive to new physics. They are <lb/>important background for many searches. As standard can-<lb/>dles, they are useful to calibrate our detectors. Addition-<lb/>ally, electroweak bosons are copiously produced in the col-<lb/>lisions, being one of the most common processes, and their <lb/>signal is considerably clean in the leptonic channels (espe-<lb/>cially in the Z boson case). <lb/>All the studies presented here share similar criteria for <lb/>W and Z selection and reconstruction. Z bosons decay into <lb/>two electrons or two muons approximately 10% of the time. <lb/>These events are characterized by two high p T , isolated <lb/>electrons or muons. The strategy in both experiments to se-<lb/>lect Z boson events is based on these characteristics, look-<lb/>ing for energetic leptons (muons or electrons) not recon-<lb/>structed within a jet. Quality criteria applied on the lep-<lb/>tons are necessary to avoid bad reconstructions, bad p T <lb/>measurements and to remove punch-through, cosmic rays <lb/>and decays in flight. The invariant mass distribution for Z <lb/>bosons decaying into two electrons after selection is shown <lb/>in Fig. 1, in the ATLAS case. The distributions in the muon <lb/>channel and in the CMS case are similar. W bosons de-<lb/>cay into one electron (muon) plus an electronic neutrino <lb/>(muonic neutrino) approx. 10% of the times per channel. <lb/>In both cases we consider in the final state the existence of <lb/>an energetic lepton (muon or electron) plus an imbalance <lb/>of energy in the transverse plane (missing transverse en-<lb/>ergy, MET). The reconstruction of such a missing energy <lb/>points generally to the existence of an undetected neutrino. <lb/>The W boson signal is not as clean as the Z boson one <lb/>due to the presence of the neutrino. Extra requirements <lb/>are applied to remove backgrounds: quality criteria and <lb/>electron p T (muon p T ) requirements (similar to the Z bo-<lb/>son ones), Drell-Yan veto (removing events with two en-<lb/>ergetic leptons, to avoid Z bosons to be reconstructed as <lb/>W bosons). In order to get a cleaner sample of W bosons, <lb/>several studies require the transverse mass of the system <lb/>[GeV] <lb/>ee <lb/>m <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>110 <lb/>Events / 1 GeV <lb/>200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1200 <lb/>1400 <lb/>= 7 TeV) <lb/>s <lb/>Data 2010 ( <lb/>ee <lb/>→ <lb/>Z <lb/>QCD <lb/>ATLAS <lb/>-1 <lb/>L dt = 36 pb <lb/>∫ <lb/>ee <lb/>→ <lb/>Central Z <lb/>Fig. 1. Z boson invariant mass distribution in the electron channel <lb/>(ATLAS). <lb/>lepton-neutrino, defined as: <lb/>M T = 2p T (µ)MET(1 − cos(∆φ µMET )) <lb/>(1) <lb/>to be higher than a certain value, generally 40-50 GeV (this <lb/>latter requirement removes almost completely the multijet <lb/>background, dominant background in the low M T region). <lb/>In this equation, p T (µ) is the muon transverse momentum, <lb/>MET the missing transverse energy and ∆φ µMET the angle <lb/>between the muon and the MET. <lb/>2 Inclusive electroweak boson production <lb/>The electroweak boson production is studied in both CMS <lb/>and ATLAS in the three leptonic channels. The W and Z <lb/>boson inclusive cross section production through their de-<lb/>cay into electrons are muons is the first electroweak mea-<lb/>surement published by both experiments ( [3], [4]). It is <lb/>measured by counting the number of events reconstructed <lb/>as W or Z bosons for a certain luminosity and correcting <lb/>for lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies and <lb/>detector acceptance. In the W boson case, the selection <lb/>is optimized to get a reasonably clean sample consisting <lb/>of more than 80% of signal in the Jacobian peak region. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 2. Ratio of results of CMS with respect to the theoretical pre-<lb/>diction. All the results are in agreement with the SM prediction <lb/>(CMS). <lb/>The analysis slightly differs in CMS and ATLAS in this <lb/>measurement. ATLAS performs a more restrictive selec-<lb/>tion (removing events with low M T or low MET). In CMS <lb/>a fit to the MET variable is used to extract the signal nor-<lb/>malization. The Z boson case is easier since it is almost <lb/>background free (less than 1%). The results published are <lb/>presented in the form of total and fiducial cross sections <lb/>and ratios of cross sections. This latter measurement is a <lb/>more stringent test of the SM since many systematic uncer-<lb/>tainties are removed or reduced when computing the ratios <lb/>(e.g. the dominant luminosity uncertainty). The total sys-<lb/>tematic uncertainty (excluded luminosity) is of the order of <lb/>2% for both experiments. All the results are in agreement <lb/>with the SM prediction. A summary of results published <lb/>by CMS is shown in Fig. 2. <lb/>W and Z bosons are also studied in the tau decay mode. <lb/>The W boson production cross section when decaying into <lb/>τ and a ν τ neutrino is measured by the ATLAS collabo-<lb/>ration [5] (CMS [6] also published preliminary results). <lb/>The properties of the tau jet (when the tau decays hadroni-<lb/>cally) are exploited to reconstruct these events. They select <lb/>events with low multiplicity, high collimated jets or with <lb/>non-zero flight distance using a boosted decision tree that <lb/>includes all these properties. A clear W to tau signal is ob-<lb/>served (more than 80% signal). The main difficulty in this <lb/>analysis is the electroweak background (W boson decays <lb/>into electrons and muons and Z boson leptonic decays) that <lb/>amounts to some 13% and has a similar shape in the trans-<lb/>verse mass as the signal (see Fig. 3). The cross section is <lb/>measured with an approx. 23% systematic uncertainty and <lb/>is compatible with the SM prediction. The Z boson sig-<lb/>nature in the tau channel is cleaner. It is studied in both <lb/>CMS [8] and ATLAS [7] in four final states: τ µ τ µ , τ µ τ e , <lb/>τ µ τ had , τ e τ had . The electroweak background is partially re-<lb/>moved by inverting the M T and MET requirements. The <lb/>τ l τ had channel is the one with the biggest branching ratio, <lb/>but we have to cope with important backgrounds, mainly <lb/>QCD multijet events. The τ e τ µ is the cleanest since no <lb/>electroweak process can produce both leptons in the same <lb/>event apart from the rare diboson processes. The τ µ τ µ is <lb/>highly affected by the Z → µµ process. A boosted deci-<lb/>sion tree in 5 kinematic variables sensitive to the kinemat-<lb/>ical differences of muons from both processes is used by <lb/>ATLAS. CMS uses a likelihood in 4 variables to separate <lb/>signal and electroweak background. A competitive result <lb/>is obtained after combining the results coming from the 4 <lb/>final states (see Fig. 4).

The Z boson produc-<lb/>tion is studied in bins of the boson rapidity. The proce-<lb/>dure for the cross section measurement is similar to that <lb/>of the total inclusive production. Results for both muons <lb/>and electrons, and the combination of them are presented <lb/>by both collaborations. In CMS [9] and ATLAS [4] they <lb/>exploit the use of the forward calorimeters to reconstruct <lb/>electrons at high rapidities. In this region the resolution is <lb/>worse but provides information for the PDFs in a new (Q 2 -<lb/>x) region. The results are compatible with the expectations <lb/>given by the reference MC in CMS and ATLAS. System-<lb/>atic uncertainties range from 3% in the central region to <lb/>7% in the forward. Fig. 5 shows the differential rapidity <lb/>distribution for Z bosons in CMS. <lb/>The Z and W boson production is also studied as a <lb/>function of the boson p T in both experiments. Of special <lb/>interest are the low p T and high p T regions of the spec-<lb/>trum. Low p T region uncertainties are dominated by non-<lb/>perturbative QCD and the MC tuning. For the Z boson, in <lb/>CMS [9] the official tune (PYTHIA [15] Z2) gives the best <lb/>agreement data-MC. In ATLAS [11] RESBOS [17] is in <lb/>optimal agreement (see Fig. 6).

A fit to <lb/>the lepton projection variable is performed which is sensi-<lb/>tive to the three components (left, right and longitudinal) <lb/>for electrons and muons, see Fig. 10. A left polarization is <lb/>observed in this study (≈ 20%), reduced with respect to the <lb/>theoretical one due to kinematic effects and other subpro-<lb/>cesses <lb/>Electroweak mixing angle. This study performed by the <lb/>CMS collaboration [14] uses 1.1 fb −1 of data.

A multivariate analysis of the three most <lb/>sensitive variables to this parameter (boson rapidity, invari-<lb/>ant mass and Collins-Soper angle) is used to extract it.
