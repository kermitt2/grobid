			<front>Conclusion: Results of the validation process supported findings of increased heart failure in the <lb/>ALLHAT doxazosin treatment arm compared to the chlorthalidone treatment arm. <lb/></front>

			<body>The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to <lb/>Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is a randomized, <lb/>two-component clinical trial sponsored by the National <lb/>Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). A double-<lb/>blind, active-controlled hypertension component is de-<lb/>signed to compare the rate of fatal coronary heart disease <lb/>(CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (the pri-<lb/>mary endpoint) in high-risk hypertensive participants, <lb/>aged 55 years or older, between those randomized to <lb/>treatment initiated with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) and <lb/>treatment initiated with each of three alternative antihy-<lb/>pertensive drugs: a calcium-channel blocker (am-<lb/>lodipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-<lb/>inhibitor (lisinopril), or an alpha-adrenergic blocker <lb/>(doxazosin). An open-label lipid-lowering component is <lb/>designed to determine if lowering LDL cholesterol with <lb/>pravastatin compared to &quot;usual care&quot; reduces all-cause <lb/>mortality in a subset of moderately hypercholesterolemic <lb/>patients. Randomization to the hypertension component <lb/>began in February, 1994, and continued through January, <lb/>1998, with 42,418 participants recruited at 623 clinical <lb/>centers in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the <lb/>US Virgin Islands. Randomization of 10,355 participants <lb/>into the lipid trial ended May 31, 1998. Follow-up on all <lb/>participants continued through March, 2002 [1]. <lb/>Following independent reviews by the Data and Safety <lb/>Monitoring Board (DSMB) on January 6, 2000, and by an <lb/>Ad Hoc Committee on January 21, 2000, the Director of <lb/>the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute accepted a <lb/>recommendation to discontinue the doxazosin treatment <lb/>arm of the antihypertensive trial. This recommendation <lb/>was based on the low probability of doxazosin showing <lb/>benefit over chlorthalidone for the primary endpoint, as <lb/>well as the significantly increased occurrence of the sec-<lb/>ondary endpoint, combined cardiovascular disease <lb/>(CVD) (encompassing CHD deaths, nonfatal MI, stroke, <lb/>coronary revascularization procedures [coronary artery <lb/>bypass graft or CABG, percutaneous transluminal coro-<lb/>nary angioplasty or PTCA/stent], angina [hospitalized or <lb/>treated as an outpatient], heart failure [HF/treated in the <lb/>hospital or as an outpatient], and peripheral arterial dis-<lb/>ease [in-hospital or outpatient revascularization]) in the <lb/>doxazosin arm (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33; P &lt; .001), <lb/>with a doubling of risk of HF (fatal, hospitalized and treat-<lb/>ed but nonhospitalized) (RR 2.04; 95% CI, 1.79-2.32; P <lb/>&lt; .001). When only fatal and hospitalized HF were ana-<lb/>lyzed, the large difference remained (RR 1.83; 95% CI, <lb/>1.58-2.13;P &lt; .001). The findings and operational aspects <lb/>of stopping the doxazosin arm of the study have been pre-<lb/>viously described [2-4]. <lb/>The observed increase in HF in the doxazosin group as <lb/>compared to the chlorthalidone group led to several addi-<lb/>tional analyses aimed toward validation of the diagnoses, <lb/>with a focus on hospitalized and fatal HF. The purposes of <lb/>these analyses were: 1) to evaluate the reality of HF cases, <lb/>i.e. whether diagnosis, management, and clinical course <lb/>were what might be expected, and 2) to compare these <lb/>features between the two treatment groups. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study Design <lb/>The rationale and design of ALLHAT are described in de-<lb/>tail elsewhere [1]. Briefly, those eligible for randomiza-<lb/>tion had systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 140 mm <lb/>Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, <lb/>or took medication for hypertension, and had at least one <lb/>other risk factor for CHD events. Risk factors included pre-<lb/>vious MI or stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy by electro-<lb/>cardiogram or echocardiogram, history of type 2 diabetes, <lb/>current cigarette smoking, and low high-density lipopro-<lb/>tein (HDL) level. <lb/>The primary endpoint of the blood pressure (BP) trial is <lb/>the composite of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD. The four <lb/>protocol-defined secondary clinical outcomes are all-<lb/>cause mortality, combined CHD (including CHD death, <lb/>nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization procedures and <lb/>hospitalized angina), stroke, and combined CVD (includ-<lb/>ing CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, coronary revasculari-<lb/>zation procedures, angina treated in the hospital or as an <lb/>outpatient, lower extremity peripheral arterial disease <lb/>treated in the hospital or with outpatient revasculariza-<lb/>tion, and HF, fatal or treated in the hospital or as an out-<lb/>patient). <lb/>The validation of HF diagnosis entailed answering several <lb/>questions: <lb/>1. Did HF cases meet ALLHAT diagnostic criteria? <lb/>2. Were baseline characteristics and medical management <lb/>for HF cases as expected and similar across the drug <lb/>groups? <lb/>3. Were prevalence and severity of systolic dysfunction as <lb/>expected and similar across drug groups? <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Were case-fatality rates as expected and similar across <lb/>drug groups? <lb/>Unless otherwise specified, all data for these analyses were <lb/>collected as of December, 1999. <lb/>Heart Failure Diagnosis <lb/>At each follow-up clinic visit the occurrence of study clin-<lb/>ical events was assessed, and, if identified by the clinical <lb/>investigator, reported on an endpoint form. For each <lb/>event involving hospitalization, a hospital discharge sum-<lb/>mary or expiration summary was to be submitted, and for <lb/>each death a death certificate was required. Endpoint <lb/>forms and supporting documentation were reviewed at <lb/>the ALLHAT Clinical Trials Center (CTC) for accuracy and <lb/>appropriateness. When a discrepancy or ambiguity was <lb/>found, the CTC sent a written query to the Principal Inves-<lb/>tigator, who retained the final word concerning the diag-<lb/>nosis or cause of death. A random 10% sample of strokes, <lb/>nonfatal MIs and CHD deaths was selected for blinded <lb/>quality control evaluation by the ALLHAT Endpoints Sub-<lb/>committee; for these cases additional documentation was <lb/>requested. <lb/>No such routine Endpoints Subcommittee quality control <lb/>was initially planned for reported HF. However, the Sub-<lb/>committee was subsequently called upon to evaluate a <lb/>random sample of reported fatal and hospitalized nonfa-<lb/>tal HF events. As this occurred prior to the termination of <lb/>the doxazosin arm, neither the chair nor the members of <lb/>the Subcommittee was informed of the major reason for <lb/>this review, namely, the trend toward a higher HF event <lb/>rate in the doxazosin group compared to the chlortha-<lb/>lidone group. The Subcommittee was told that the review <lb/>was undertaken at the request of the DSMB to address the <lb/>reliability and validity of reported HF events. This evalua-<lb/>tion consisted of fifty events, evenly distributed across the <lb/>four treatment groups, reported as fatal or hospitalized <lb/>nonfatal HF and with protocol-required documentation <lb/>(discharge summary for hospitalized events, death certifi-<lb/>cates for deaths). Additional material was not requested, <lb/>since this would have posed an undue burden on the clin-<lb/>ical site staff and would have risked raising questions <lb/>about emerging differences among treatment groups. <lb/>The ALLHAT definition of HF, used previously in the <lb/>Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) [5], <lb/>includes &quot;patients with clear-cut signs or symptoms of left <lb/>or right ventricular dysfunction that cannot be attributed <lb/>to other causes...&quot; The diagnosis of HF must include at <lb/>least one of four stated symptoms [paroxysmal nocturnal <lb/>dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, New York Heart Classification <lb/>functional class III (for definition see Additional Informa-<lb/>tion, Item 1), or orthopnea], and one of seven stated signs <lb/>(rales, 2+ or greater ankle edema, tachycardia of 120 <lb/>beats/minute or more after five minutes at rest, cardiome-<lb/>galy by chest x-ray, chest x-ray characteristic of HF, S 3 gal-<lb/>lop, or jugular venous distention). Since lower extremity <lb/>edema or exertional dyspnea may be due to non-cardiac <lb/>causes, the presence of either of these alone, without other <lb/>indications of heart failure, is not sufficient for a diagnosis <lb/>of HF. Study guidelines caution against a hasty HF diagno-<lb/>sis in patients with severe pulmonary disease, including <lb/>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneu-<lb/>monia, or other severe, documented lung disease. <lb/>Baseline Characteristics and Medical Management <lb/>Baseline characteristics of chlorthalidone and doxazosin <lb/>participants were compared. These analyses were stratified <lb/>by HF outcome: 1) fatal and hospitalized HF; 2) treated, <lb/>non-hospitalized HF; and, 3) no HF. <lb/>Post-HF event medical management may provide addi-<lb/>tional evidence of the physicians&apos; confidence in the HF di-<lb/>agnosis. The post-event use of open-label diuretics, ACE-<lb/>inhibitors, and beta-blockers, i.e., accepted treatments for <lb/>HF [6-9], was compared between doxazosin and chlo-<lb/>rthalidone groups, as was the proportion in each group of <lb/>those who remained on assigned blinded medication after <lb/>the event. (For study guidelines regarding the use and re-<lb/>porting of open-label medicines of the same class as the <lb/>blinded drugs, see Additional Information, Items 2 and <lb/>3.) <lb/>Ejection Fraction Review <lb/>A CTC physician plus non-medical staff reviewed in a <lb/>blinded fashion 361 hospitalized HF events (representing <lb/>278 participants) for ejection fraction data: looking for <lb/>whether an ejection fraction was measured, the method <lb/>utilized, and the measurement. Results, tabulated by ran-<lb/>domization groups, reflected data that had been collected <lb/>up to July, 1999, the time of the review. <lb/>Case-Fatality Rates and Causes of Death <lb/>As a measure of the diagnostic validity and severity of HF <lb/>and comparability between drug groups, time-from-<lb/>event-to-death analyses of participants with hospitalized <lb/>or treated HF were compared between the two groups. <lb/>Causes of death of such participants were also compared <lb/>in the doxazosin and chlorthalidone groups. <lb/>Statistical Analyses <lb/>Data were analyzed according to participants&apos; randomiza-<lb/>tion assignments and HF outcome status, regardless of <lb/>subsequent medication adherence. The Kaplan-Meier <lb/>method was utilized in calculating cumulative event rates. <lb/>Descriptive statistics by treatment groups were presented <lb/>for baseline characteristics, HF ascertainment, ejection <lb/>fractions and use of HF medications.

			<body>disease (ASCVD), and ST-T wave changes, were reported <lb/>more often in chlorthalidone than in doxazosin partici-<lb/>pants, though the differences were not significant. Chlo-<lb/>rthalidone and doxazosin participants with hospitalized <lb/>or fatal HF had similar pre-trial antihypertensive treat-<lb/>ment durations. None of these differences was significant <lb/>at P &lt; .05. <lb/>Participants with HF events displayed higher rates of most <lb/>cardiovascular risk factors compared to those without HF <lb/>events. Approximately 35-36% of chlorthalidone and <lb/>doxazosin participants with fatal or hospitalized HF had <lb/>reported prior MI or stroke as baseline eligibility risk fac-<lb/>tors, compared to 22-23% of those without HF (P &lt; <lb/>.001). Participants with hospitalized/fatal HF had signifi-<lb/>cantly higher rates of pre-randomization coronary artery <lb/>bypass grafts (CABGs) and coronary angioplasties (19-<lb/>23% of those with HF vs. 13% of those without; P &lt; .001) <lb/>and other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) <lb/>(29-33% of those with HF vs. 23-25% of those without; <lb/>P &lt; .001). Diabetes as a baseline risk factor occurred more <lb/>frequently in those with HF: 47-48% in those with HF, <lb/>35-36% in those without (P &lt; .001). Left ventricular <lb/>hypertrophy (LVH) by ECG was a risk factor in 21-22% of <lb/>those who later developed HF, compared with 16% of <lb/>those in each group who did not develop HF (P &lt; .001). <lb/>Baseline pulse pressure (PP) showed some variation be-<lb/>tween participants who did and did not develop HF. For <lb/>participants with subsequent hospitalization or death <lb/>from HF, PP was 67 and 68 mm Hg for the chlorthalidone <lb/>and doxazosin groups, respectively. Treated, non-hospi-<lb/>talized participants showed a lower mean baseline PP of <lb/>65 (chlorthalidone group) and 64 mm Hg (doxazosin <lb/>group), and an even lower mean PP in those without HF <lb/>(62 mm Hg in each group). <lb/>Medical Management <lb/>Table 2 presents post-event pharmacologic treatment of <lb/>participants with HF and antihypertensive treatment of <lb/>participants without HF. Following hospitalization for <lb/>HF, 36% (83/232) of chlorthalidone participants and <lb/>45% (126/281) of doxazosin participants remained on <lb/>their blinded medications. Percentages of participants on <lb/>open-label diuretics and ACE-inhibitors were similar fol-<lb/>lowing the event: 58% (135/232) of chlorthalidone par-<lb/>ticipants and 64% (180/281) of doxazosin participants <lb/>were prescribed open-label diuretics; 39% (90/232) of <lb/>chlorthalidone participants and 41% (114/281) of doxa-<lb/>zosin participants were prescribed open-label ACE-inhib-<lb/>itors. Beta-blockers were prescribed for 14% of each group <lb/>following the event, which was actually somewhat less <lb/>than for participants who did not develop HF.

			<body>22% (32/145) of the doxazosin group, approximately the <lb/>same frequency as in participants without HF. In both <lb/>treatment groups, a diuretic, ACE-inhibitor or beta-block-<lb/>er was prescribed for over 75% of these participants (72/ <lb/>93 in chlorthalidone group, 119/145 in doxazosin <lb/>group). <lb/>Ejection Fraction Review <lb/>Table 3 displays the ejection fraction data. About half <lb/>(178/361) of reviewed discharge summaries mentioned <lb/>ejection fractions measured during hospitalization, two-<lb/>thirds (116/169) of which had quantitative measure-<lb/>ments reported in the discharge summaries (data not giv-<lb/>en). Considering only the earliest ejection fraction <lb/>information ascertained for each HF participant, 63% <lb/>(29/46) of the chlorthalidone and 70% (41/59) of the <lb/>doxazosin participants had ejection fractions at or below <lb/>40%. Just under half (27/59) of the ejection fractions re-<lb/>ported in the doxazosin group were at or below 30%, <lb/>compared with one third (15/46) in the chlorthalidone <lb/>group. Two-thirds of ejection fractions were obtained by <lb/>echocardiograms, though catheterizations accounted for a <lb/>larger percentage of results in the doxazosin group than in <lb/>the chlorthalidone group (36% vs. 24%). <lb/>Causes of Death and 2-Year Case-Fatality <lb/>Causes of death of participants with previous HF hospital-<lb/>ization were distributed similarly in the two groups, with <lb/>slight variations. HF accounted for 21.2% (11/52) of the <lb/>deaths among chlorthalidone participants and 17.1% <lb/>(12/70) of the deaths among doxazosin participants. Over <lb/>half of the deaths in each group (29/52 in the chlortha-<lb/>lidone group; 43/70 in the doxazosin group) were due to <lb/>cardiovascular events. Fifteen percent (8/52) of deaths in <lb/>the chlorthalidone group were attributed to cancer, com-<lb/>pared to 9% (6/70) in the doxazosin group (Table 4). <lb/>Case-fatality for participants with hospitalized HF events <lb/>showed no significant differences (RR 0.96, 95% CI, <lb/>0.67-1.38, P = 0.83) between the two treatment groups <lb/>(Figure 1). Among participants in the doxazosin treat-<lb/>ment group who had been previously hospitalized for HF, <lb/>22.1% (70/317) subsequently died, compared to 18.6% <lb/>(52/280) of those in the chlorthalidone group (Table 4). <lb/>As previously reported, all-cause mortality did not signifi-<lb/>cantly differ in the two treatment groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI <lb/>0.90-1.15, P = 0.56) [2]. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The finding of significantly increased HF events in the <lb/>doxazosin group compared with the chlorthalidone <lb/>group created a dilemma for ALLHAT. Since the trial was <lb/>not designed to focus on HF, a component of a secondary <lb/>endpoint, the validity of reported HF events became an is-<lb/>sue. In this paper, we have described several analyses to <lb/>address this concern. <lb/>As previously reported, lost-to-follow-up and event docu-<lb/>mentation were similar in the two treatment groups [2]. <lb/>Steps employed to validate the HF outcome in these treat-<lb/>ment groups confirmed the consistency of HF event re-<lb/>porting.

			<body>baseline characteristics when stratified by HF status. The <lb/>differences in eligibility risk factors between those partici-<lb/>pants with HF and those without is not surprising: larger <lb/>percentages of those with HF had a history of MI, stroke, <lb/>CABG, angioplasty, other atherosclerotic cardiovascular <lb/>disease (ASCVD), diabetes, low HDL levels and ECG ab-<lb/>normalities. Nonetheless, these eligibility factors were not <lb/>substantially different between chlorthalidone and doxa-<lb/>zosin participants with HF. <lb/>Post-diagnosis pharmacologic management of patients is <lb/>one measure of the strength of physicians&apos; confidence in <lb/>the HF diagnoses. Open-label diuretics, ACE-inhibitors <lb/>and beta-blockers, all recognized treatments for HF, were <lb/>prescribed similarly for the chlorthalidone and doxazosin <lb/>groups, suggesting similar assessment of these events in <lb/>the two treatment groups. <lb/>ALLHAT criteria for HF were equivalently met in the two <lb/>groups. While the sample (n = 50) of hospitalized or fatal <lb/>HF reports reviewed by the ALLHAT Endpoints Subcom-<lb/>mittee was limited in number and in adequacy of corrob-<lb/>orating documentation, the review nonetheless showed <lb/>adherence to study criteria for the majority (85%) of the <lb/>event reports. The sometimes-discrepant results between <lb/>reviewers pertained more often to incomplete data than to <lb/>rejection of a HF diagnosis. <lb/>Clinical use of more objective measures, including nonin-<lb/>vasive and/or invasive tools for the measurement of left <lb/>ventricular function, offers a means of establishing and <lb/>quantifying systolic failure in cases clinically suggestive of <lb/>HF [7,10]. Among the ejection fractions reported in the <lb/>ALLHAT events that were reviewed, the majority fell at or <lb/>below 40%, indicating some degree of systolic dysfunc-<lb/>tion. However, HF is a clinical diagnosis that does not nec-<lb/>essarily exclude those with intact left ventricular systolic <lb/>function [11]. Hypertension is a major risk factor for di-<lb/>astolic HF; as many as 25% of asymptomatic hyperten-<lb/>sives with left ventricular hypertrophy have diastolic <lb/>dysfunction. Additionally, 90% of patients with coronary <lb/>artery disease may have some degree of diastolic dysfunc-<lb/>tion [12]. <lb/>The two-fold increased relative risk of HF in the doxazosin <lb/>group compared to the chlorthalidone group changed lit-<lb/>tle when confined to hospitalized and fatal events. Fur-<lb/>ther, HF patients in both the doxazosin and <lb/>chlorthalidone treatment groups showed a rather high <lb/>20% case-fatality rate over two years, as expected in HF pa-<lb/>tients [11,13,14], further supporting the validity of the di-<lb/>agnoses in the two groups. Among participants <lb/>hospitalized for HF who subsequently died, over half of <lb/>the deaths in each drug group were attributed to cardio-<lb/>vascular causes. <lb/>Treatment group differences in mortality attributed to HF <lb/>may take time to be recognized. Patients with HF are at <lb/>risk for other competing causes of death. Accordingly, it <lb/>may be too early to determine if a higher rate of HF in the <lb/>doxazosin group translates into a higher overall mortality <lb/>rate. A 20% 2-year case-fatality rate with a 4% difference <lb/>in HF incidence rate translates into a 0.8% potential dif-<lb/>ference in total mortality without any competing causes of <lb/>Table 4: Causes of Death of Participants with Prior Heart Failure Hospitalization <lb/>Chlorthalidone Treatment Group <lb/>Doxazosin Treatment Group <lb/>No. of participants with hospitalization for heart <lb/>failure prior to death* <lb/>280 <lb/>317 <lb/>No. of deaths (%) <lb/>52 (18.6) <lb/>70 (22.1) <lb/>Cause of death (%) <lb/>Myocardial infarction <lb/>7 (13.5) <lb/>5 (7.1) <lb/>Definite CHD <lb/>5 (9.6) <lb/>9 (12.9) <lb/>Possible CHD <lb/>1 (1.9) <lb/>7 (10.0) <lb/>Stroke <lb/>1 (1.9) <lb/>3 (4.3) <lb/>Heart failure <lb/>11 (21.2) <lb/>12 (17.1) <lb/>Other CVD <lb/>4 (7.7) <lb/>7 (10.0) <lb/>Total cardiovascular deaths (%) <lb/>29 (55.8) <lb/>43 (61.4) <lb/>Cancer <lb/>8 (15.4) <lb/>6 (8.6) <lb/>Kidney disease <lb/>1 (1.9) <lb/>1 (1.4) <lb/>Accident/suicide/homicide <lb/>0 (0) <lb/>1 (1.4) <lb/>Other non-CVD <lb/>8 (15.4) <lb/>11 (15.7) <lb/>Unknown <lb/>6 (11.5) <lb/>8 (11.4) <lb/>CHD = Coronary heart disease CVD = Cardiovascular disease *Excludes participants for whom death is the first reported heart failure event <lb/></body>

			<body>death. With competing causes, the difference would be <lb/>smaller and difficult to detect even in a trial of ALLHAT&apos;s <lb/>size. <lb/>The diagnosis of HF is generally made on the basis of signs <lb/>and symptoms that may overlap with those of other cardi-<lb/>ovascular and pulmonary pathologies. Moreover, the clin-<lb/>ical picture may be further complicated for patients taking <lb/>doxazosin, side effects of which (edema, dyspnea, and <lb/>tachycardia) [15] may be misinterpreted as manifesta-<lb/>tions of HF. <lb/>The capture of events in a &quot;large and simple trial&quot; such as <lb/>ALLHAT has potential limitations. Built into a structure <lb/>composed largely of community-based physicians is the <lb/>assumption that their characterization of clinical events <lb/>reflects diagnostic standards of the medical community, <lb/>and, as such, meets study criteria. However, with its large <lb/>number of endpoints, resources available to ALLHAT pre-<lb/>cluded more than modest confirmatory event documenta-<lb/>tion. Resources were allocated for additional <lb/>documentation for quality control validation only for a <lb/>sample of the primary endpoint (MIs and fatal CHD) and <lb/>for strokes. While all reported events are reviewed at the <lb/>CTC, the sometimes incomplete supporting details in <lb/>documentation may not allow for validation of all events <lb/>according to ALLHAT criteria. Some discharge summaries <lb/>and death certificates may lack sufficient descriptive infor-<lb/>mation needed to confirm the clinical diagnoses. Clinic <lb/>staff are unable to provide corroborating documentation <lb/>for 2% of ALLHAT event reports. <lb/>Efforts to authenticate the HF events in the doxazosin and <lb/>chlorthalidone treatment groups represented a desirable <lb/>step in the examination of the increased rate of HR in the <lb/>doxazosin group.
