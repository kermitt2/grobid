We found a striking correlation <lb/>between σ n and λ −2 regardless of doping, oxygen reduction or defects, thus <lb/>providing a simple method to predict the superconducting penetration depth <lb/>and to have an estimate of the sample quality by measuring the normal-state <lb/>conductivity. <lb/></front>

			<body>The superconducting penetration depth, λ(0), is one of the most important electrody-<lb/>namic properties of the high-temperature superconductors and provides direct information <lb/>about the spectral weight of the superconducting condensate [1]. In the normal state the low <lb/>frequency electrodynamics can be characterized by the absolute value of the conductivity <lb/>σ n (ν, T ). At not too high frequencies, σ n (ν, T ) is in a good approximation a real function <lb/>of frequency. Because λ(0) and σ n (0, T ) both involve a Fermi-surface averaging and depend <lb/>on the same amplitude factors e 2 N(0)υ 2 <lb/>F [2], they may be expected to be connected to each <lb/>other. <lb/>In order to investigate possible correlations experimentally, we have carried out <lb/>submillimeter-wave (100 GHz ¡ ν ¡1100 GHz) transmission experiments on different thin <lb/>YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ films. Optimally doped films on different substrates were obtained by laser <lb/>ablation and by magnetron sputtering. One film was oxygen reduced after the measurement <lb/>and then remeasured under identical conditions. Transmission experiments in the frequency <lb/>range 100-1100 GHz were performed utilizing a set of backward-wave oscillators. The mea-<lb/>surements were performed in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer arrangement [3] which allows <lb/>both, the measurements of transmission and phase shift. The properties of the substrates <lb/>were determined in separate experiments. Utilizing the Fresnel optical formulas for the <lb/>complex transmission coefficient for a double layer system, the complex conductivity was <lb/>determined from the observed spectra without any approximations. It is important to note, <lb/>that the absolute values of the conductivity could be deduced directly from the experiment. <lb/>The penetration depth was calculated from the conductivity data via λ = c/ωk, with k <lb/>being the imaginary part of the complex refractive index k = Im[i(σ 1 + iσ 2 )/ε ω] 1/2 . This <lb/>expression for λ gives the usual microwave result λ = (µ 0 ωσ 2 ) −1/2 in the limit σ 1 ≪ |σ 2 | and <lb/>reduces to the expression for the skin depth in the normal state (σ ≫ |σ 2 |). <lb/>The submillimeter properties of YBa Cu 3 O 7−δ films for a fixed frequency ν = 450 GHz <lb/>(15 cm −1 ) are summarized in the Table 1. In addition, some details of the film preparation, <lb/>the weight of the superconducting condensate (ω <lb/>p,s = c 2 /λ(0) 2 ), and the effective scattering <lb/>rate (Eq. 1) are given. The detailed submillimeter-wave data for the samples No.1,3,5 were <lb/>published previously [5-7]. The data in Tab.1 are represented in the order of decreasing <lb/>absolute values of the conductivities at 100 K. Comparing the conductivity column with the <lb/>penetration depth column, the correlation between these two quantities becomes obvious. <lb/>
			With the exception of the sample No.4, the penetration depth increases with decreasing <lb/>conductivities. We note that the scattering of data for different samples may be connected <lb/>with experimental difficulties in measuring the absolute values of conductivity and penetra-<lb/>tion depth. In addition, in spite of substantial progress in prepairing good quality YBaCuO <lb/>films [4], the details of deposition process still may influence the experimental results. <lb/>To check the possible correlation between σ n and λ in more detail, the normal state con-<lb/>ductivity and the superconducting penetration depth were analyzed on the basis of published <lb/>data available up to now. The results of this analysis are summarized in Fig. 1. In order to <lb/>simplify the analysis only results on YBaCuO based materials were considered. To compare <lb/>the absolute values of the conductivity for different samples the characteristic temperature <lb/>of T =100 K was chosen. It is well known [8] that the resistivity even of oxygen reduced <lb/>or doped cuprates is to a reasonable approximation linear for temperatures between 100 K <lb/>and 300 K. A linear temperature scaling was therefore used, if the results were reported at <lb/>temperatures different from T =100 K. Taking into account the relatively strong scattering <lb/>of the data for different samples, this procedure certainly introduces no substantial errors. <lb/>Fig. 1 represents the data as measured by different experimental methods. In addition to <lb/>the thin film results by THz transmission technique [9-15], mutual inductance data [16,17] <lb/>and single crystal data [18-22] are shown. The remarkable feature of Fig. 1 is that the <lb/>majority of experimental points closely follows the dashed line, which is the best fit to our <lb/>data according to the expression λ(0) −2 /µ 0 = σ n /τ , with 1/τ = 22 THz. Fig. 1 thus suggest <lb/>that the absolute value of the conductivity in the normal state is approximately proportional <lb/>to the spectral weight of the superconducting condensate ω <lb/>p,s or to the inverse square of the <lb/>penetration depth λ(0) −2 . <lb/>In the following we would like to suggest rather simple arguments to understand this rela-<lb/>tion. Within the isotropic approximation the real part of the conductivity can be written as <lb/>σ n = ε 0 ω 2 <lb/>p,n τ , where τ −1 is the quasiparticle scattering rate and ε 0 ω 2 <lb/>p,n is the spectral weight <lb/>of the Drude peak. For a number of high temperature cuprates in the normal conducting <lb/>state the characteristic scattering rate has been shown to increase linear in temperature fol-<lb/>lowing h/τ ≈ 2k B T [23]. Assuming the value ∆ = 2k B T C for the energy gap [24], one obtains <lb/>the approximation for the ratio of mean free path to the coherence length, ℓ/ξ = πτ ∆/ℏ ≈ 3. <lb/>As the scattering rate decreases even stronger than linearly below T C [1], at low tempera-<lb/>tures the high-T C superconductors are in the clean limit and the spectral weight of a Drude <lb/>peak (ε 0 ω 2 <lb/>p,n = ne 2 /m * ) is expected to fully condense into the delta function at T =0K. <lb/>This conclusion is supported by the Drude-analysis of the frequency dependent conductivity <lb/>of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ [5] and by a comparison of the conductivity spectral weights at infrared <lb/>frequencies [25]. In the clean limit the following expression holds <lb/>1 <lb/>µ 0 λ(0) 2 = ε 0 ω 2 <lb/>p,s = ε 0 ω <lb/>p,n = σ n /τ <lb/>(1) <lb/>
			The Eq.(1) thus suggests the possible explanation of the correlation in Fig. 1: obviously <lb/>defects (doping, sample quality) and oxygen concentration change only the density of states <lb/>at the Fermi-level, N(0), or the effective number of charge carriers, ω 2 <lb/>p,s and ω 2 <lb/>p,n , and do not <lb/>affect the effective scattering rate τ −1 . Theoretical calculations of the normal-state prop-<lb/>erties using spin-fluctuation scattering [26], Fermi-surface nesting [27] or phenomenological <lb/>marginal Fermi-liquid approach [28] result in the quasiparticle scattering rate, which is not <lb/>dependent on N(0), but is approximately proportional to temperature. Therefore, within a <lb/>reasonable approximation, τ −1 may be supposed to be unsensitve to the level of defects. As <lb/>long as the sample is in the clean limit, the complete Drude spectral weight ω 2 <lb/>p,n condenses <lb/>into the superconducting delta function retaining the correlation between the normal and <lb/>the superconducting state given by Eq. (1). <lb/>Interestingly, the Ni-and Zn-doped samples of Ulm et al. [17] and the Pr doped samples of <lb/>Brorson et al. [9] still follow the correlation of Fig.1, except for the samples with the highest <lb/>doping levels (6% Ni, 40% Pr, or 4% Zn doping). The different behavior of heavily doped <lb/>samples is probably due to the fact, that they are no more in the clean limit. Therefore a <lb/>substantial portion of the &quot;normal&quot; spectral weight is not condensed into the delta function <lb/>at low temperatures and the penetration depth λ(0) = c/ω p,s is substantially higher than <lb/>the value estimated from Eq. (1), λ(0) = c/ω p,n . In addition Fig. 1 shows that Zn doping <lb/>has the strongest effect on the electrodynamic properties of high-T C &apos;s compared to Ni or Pr. <lb/>Similar conclusion has been drawn on the basis of the microwave data by Bonn et al. [29]. <lb/>Although simple arguments, presented above, give an idea to understand the observed <lb/>correlation, we cannot exclude other possible explanations. E.g. even the application of <lb/>Fermi-liquid picture to high-temperature superconductors is still an intensively discussed <lb/>problem [2,30]. Further on and especially concerning optimally doped YBCO films, the <lb/>extrinsic effects may also play an important role in determining the conductivity values. The <lb/>influence of weak links on the surface impedance of granular superconductors was discussed <lb/>in detail by Halbritter [31]. <lb/>The scattering rate 1/τ = 22 THz, as deduced from the dashed line in Fig. 1, leads <lb/>to the following expression at T =100 K: h/τ = 1.7k B T . This relation is similar to h/τ ≈ <lb/>2k B T [23] cited above. On the basis of the above presented discussion we may conclude, <lb/>that the scattering rate h/τ = 1.7k B T is to a good approximation independent of doping, <lb/>oxygen depletion and defects. Hence, the proportionality between λ(0) −2 and σ n provides <lb/>a simple possibility to characterize the superconducting properties of the YBaCuO samples <lb/>by measuring the normal state conductivity by e.g. standard four point method. On the <lb/>basis of data, presented in Fig.1 the penetration depth of a certain sample is given by the <lb/>approximate expression <lb/>λ(0)[nm] = 190/ σ n (100K)[10 4 Ω −1 cm −1 ] = 19 • ρ n (100K)[µΩ • cm] <lb/>(2) <lb/>Eq. (2) describes 80% of all penetration depth data in Fig. 1 with deviations well <lb/>below 25%. Finally it should be noted, that most points of Fig.1 represent thin-film data. <lb/>The applicability of Eq. (2) for single crystals should be checked in more detail in further <lb/>investigations. <lb/>In conclusion, we have measured the conductivity and the penetration depth of a variety <lb/>of YBaCuO samples and compared our results to published data. We have plotted the <lb/>low temperature penetration depth as a function of the normal-state conductivity, where <lb/>the absolute values for both parameters were available on the same sample. In this plot <lb/>we observe a correlation λ −2 ∽ σ n . This observation allows the estimate of the penetration <lb/>depth of a given YBaCuO sample by measuring its normal state conductivity. In the normal <lb/>conducting state we find universal scattering rate h/τ = 1.7k B T independent of defects, <lb/>oxygen concentration and doping. <lb/></body>
