			<front>Abstract <lb/>Identifying the molecular programs underlying human organ development and how they differ from <lb/>those in model species will advance our understanding of human health and disease. <lb/>Developmental gene expression profiles provide a window into the genes underlying organ <lb/>development as well as a direct means to compare them across species. We use a transcriptomic <lb/>resource for mammalian organ development to characterize the temporal profiles of human genes <lb/>associated with distinct disease classes and to determine, for each human gene, the similarity of its <lb/>spatiotemporal expression with its orthologs in rhesus macaque, mouse, rat and rabbit. We find <lb/>that half of human genes differ from their mouse orthologs in their temporal trajectories. These <lb/>include more than 200 disease genes associated with brain, heart and liver disease, for which mouse <lb/>models should undergo extra scrutiny. We provide a new resource that evaluates for every human <lb/>gene its suitability to be modeled in different mammalian species. <lb/>Keywords: human disease, animal models, organogenesis, gene expression. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The genetic programs underlying human organ development are only partially understood, yet they <lb/>hold the key to understanding organ morphology, physiology and disease [1-6]. Gene expression is <lb/>a molecular readout of developmental processes and therefore provides a window into the genes <lb/>and regulatory networks underlying organ development [7,8]. By densely profiling gene expression <lb/>throughout organ development, we get one step closer to identifying the genes and molecular <lb/>processes that underlie organ differentiation, maturation and physiology [9-13]. We also advance <lb/>our understanding of what happens when these processes are disturbed and lead to disease. <lb/>Spatiotemporal gene expression profiles provide a wealth of information on human disease genes, <lb/>which can be leveraged to gain new insights into the etiology and symptomatology of diseases <lb/>[8,14-16]. <lb/>Much of the progress made in unraveling the genetic programs responsible for human organ <lb/>development has come from research in model organisms. Mice and other mammals (e.g., rats and <lb/>rhesus macaques) are routinely used as models of both normal human development and human <lb/>disease because it is generally assumed that the genes and regulatory networks underlying <lb/>development are largely conserved across these species. While this is generally true, there are also <lb/>critical differences between species during development, which underlie the large diversity of <lb/></body>

			<body>mammalian organ phenotypes [1-6,8]. Identifying the commonalities and differences between the <lb/>genetic programs underlying organ development in different mammalian species is therefore <lb/>paramount for assessing the translatability of knowledge obtained from mammalian models to <lb/>understand human health and disease. Critically, gene expression profiles can be directly compared <lb/>between species, especially when they are derived from matching cells/organs and developmental <lb/>stages. Gene expression therefore offers a direct means to evaluate similarities and differences <lb/>between species in organ developmental programs. While the relationship between gene <lb/>expression and phenotypes is not linear, identifying when and where gene expression differs <lb/>between humans and other species will help identify the conditions (i.e., developmental stages, <lb/>organs, genes) under which model species may not be well suited to model human development <lb/>and disease. <lb/>Here, we take advantage of a developmental gene expression resource [13], which densely covers <lb/>the development of seven major organs in humans and other mammals, to characterize the <lb/>spatiotemporal profiles of human disease genes and gain new insights into the symptomatology of <lb/>diseases. We also determine for each human gene (including disease-associated genes) the <lb/>similarity of its spatiotemporal expression with that of its orthologs in mouse, rat, rabbit and rhesus <lb/>macaque. Our analyses and datasets therefore provide a new resource for assessing the suitability <lb/>of different mammalian species to model the action of individual genes and/or processes in both <lb/>healthy and pathological human organ development. <lb/>Results <lb/>An expression atlas of human organ development <lb/>The resource [13] provides human gene expression time series for seven major organs: brain <lb/>(forebrain/cerebrum), cerebellum (hindbrain/cerebellum), heart, kidney, liver, ovary and testis <lb/>(Figure 1A). The time series start at 4 weeks post-conception (wpc), which corresponds to early <lb/>organogenesis for all organs except the heart (mid-organogenesis), and then cover prenatal <lb/>development weekly until 20 wpc. The sampling restarts at birth and spans all major developmental <lb/>milestones, including ageing (Figure 1A; total of 297 RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries). Matching <lb/>datasets are available for mouse (316 libraries), rat (350 libraries) and rabbit (315 libraries) until <lb/>adulthood and for rhesus macaque starting at a late fetal stage (i.e., embryonic (e) day 93, <lb/>corresponding to 19 wpc human [13]; 154 libraries; Methods). <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify the main clusters (modules) of <lb/>highly correlated genes during human organ development (Methods). We then characterized each <lb/>module according to its developmental profile (Figure 1B; Figure S1A), functional and disease <lb/>enrichments (Figure 1b; Table S1), and proportion of transcription factors (TFs) [17], RNA-binding <lb/>proteins (RBPs) [18] and developmentally dynamic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [19] (Figure 1B). <lb/>As expected, there is a clear match between the disease enrichments of each module and its organ <lb/>developmental profile (Figure 1B). For example, module M3 comprises 2,420 genes mainly <lb/>expressed in the liver and it is associated with a number of liver-related diseases (e.g., fatty liver). <lb/>Module M20 (822 genes) comprises genes mainly expressed in the heart and is associated with a <lb/>number of cardiomyopathies. Consistent with previous work [13], we observe that modules <lb/>associated with higher expression early in development have a significantly higher fraction of TFs <lb/>than modules associated with higher expression late in development (Pearson&apos;s ρ: -0.71, P-value = <lb/>5 x 10 -6 ; Figure S1B), a result that is consistent with TFs directing most of organogenesis. The <lb/>modules identified also provide a wealth of information on poorly characterized genes, that through <lb/>&quot;guilt-by-association&quot; can be assigned putative functions (Table S2). We identified a strong positive <lb/>correlation between the fraction of protein-coding genes in a module that are among the least <lb/>studied in the human genome [20] and the module&apos;s fraction of dynamic lncRNAs (ρ: +0.77, P-value <lb/>= 2 x 10 -7 ). Modules rich in dynamic lncRNAs and poorly studied protein-coding genes are frequently <lb/>associated with high expression in the gonads (Figure 1B) but are also found in association with high <lb/>expression in each of the other organs (e.g., module M9 for brain and module M11 for cerebellum). <lb/>The breadth of developmental expression (i.e., the organ-and time-specificity of a gene) informs on <lb/>gene function, because it is expected to correlate with the spatiotemporal manifestation of <lb/>phenotypes. TFs, RBPs and members of the seven major signaling pathways all play key roles during <lb/>development but have distinct spatiotemporal profiles (Figure S2; time-and organ-specificity are <lb/>strongly correlated [13]). Consistent with previous observations [18], RBPs are generally <lb/>ubiquitously expressed, with only 6% (100) showing time-and/or organ-specificity (Figure S3). <lb/>Among these are the developmental regulators LIN28A and LIN28B, which are expressed at the <lb/>earliest stages across somatic organs; the heart-specific splicing factor RMB20, which has been <lb/>associated with cardiomyopathy; gonad-specific RBPs predicted to bind to piRNAs; and several <lb/>members of the ELAV family of neuronal regulators. Signaling genes also tend to be ubiquitously <lb/>expressed (Figure S2), but they include a higher fraction (19-20%) of time-and/or organ-specific <lb/>genes than RBPs. As expected, the greatest variation in the breadth of spatiotemporal expression is <lb/></body>

			<body>found among classes of TFs (Figure S2). Myb TFs are mostly ubiquitously expressed (Figure S4), <lb/>whereas homeobox, POU-homeobox (Figure S5) and forkhead (Figure S6) TFs display high time-and <lb/>organ-specificity (Figure S2). Although only 16% of zinc finger TFs show spatiotemporal specificity, <lb/>they constitute ~1/4 of all time-and/or organ-specific TFs due to their high abundance. Another <lb/>~1/4 corresponds to homeobox TFs, and the remaining half derive from various classes of TFs. <lb/>Notable among homeobox TFs are the Hox genes, which are critical for pattern specification at the <lb/>earliest stages of development [21]. In the developmental span examined in our study, Hox genes <lb/>play an important role during the development of the urogenital system and the early hindbrain <lb/>(but not cerebrum) (Figure S7). <lb/></body>

			<body>Spatiotemporal profiles of disease genes <lb/>The breadth of developmental expression can also inform on the etiology and phenotypic <lb/>manifestation of human diseases. We integrated a dataset of human essential genes [22] with the <lb/>set of genes associated with inherited disease in the manually curated Human Gene Mutation <lb/>Database (&quot;disease genes&quot;) [23] to compare the breadth of developmental expression of genes in <lb/>distinct classes of phenotypic severity (Figure 2A). We found a clear association between expression <lb/>pleiotropy (i.e., fraction of total samples in which genes are expressed) and the severity of <lb/>phenotypes (Figure 2B). Essential genes that are not associated with disease are likely enriched for <lb/>embryonic lethality and are, congruently, the most pleiotropic. Genes that when mutated range <lb/>from lethality to causing disease (often developmental disorders affecting multiple organs) are less <lb/>pleiotropic than embryonic lethals but are more pleiotropic than genes only associated with disease <lb/>(both P-value = 2 x 10 -16 , Wilcoxon rank sum test, two-sided; Figure 2B). Finally, non-lethal disease <lb/>genes are more pleiotropic than genes not associated with deleterious phenotypes (P-value = 2 x <lb/>10 -5 ; Figure 2B). A similar association is obtained when looking independently at organ-and time-<lb/>specificity (Figure S8A). <lb/>Human diseases differ in terms of severity, age of onset and organs affected, all of which should be <lb/>reflected in the spatiotemporal expression profiles of underlying disease genes. We therefore <lb/>looked at the time-and organ-specificity of genes associated with different classes of disease [23] <lb/>(Figure 2C). As expected, the specificity of the spatiotemporal profiles of disease genes differs <lb/>considerably among disease classes. Genes implicated in developmental disorders, cancer and <lb/>diseases of the nervous system tend to be ubiquitously expressed (spatially and temporally), <lb/>whereas genes causing heart and reproductive diseases tend to have more restricted expression <lb/>(Figure 2C). Further insights were obtained by analysing the temporal trajectories of disease genes <lb/>within the organs they affect. We used a soft clustering approach to identify the most common <lb/>expression profiles in each organ and assigned each gene a probability of belonging to each of the <lb/>clusters (Methods; Table S2). Disease genes are enriched within specific clusters, which are disease <lb/>and organ-specific. For example, genes associated with heart disease are significantly enriched <lb/>among genes characterized by a progressive increase in expression throughout heart development, <lb/>whereas genes associated with metabolic diseases are enriched among genes that exhibit a strong <lb/>up-regulation in the liver in the first months after birth (Figure S8B-C). <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Within the brain, we focused on the temporal trajectories of genes associated with three <lb/>neurodevelopmental disorders: primary microcephaly, autism and schizophrenia (Methods). <lb/>Consistent with these disorders having different etiologies and ages of onset, the associated genes <lb/>are significantly enriched among distinct temporal profiles in the brain (Figure 2D). Genes causing <lb/>primary microcephaly show their highest expression at the earliest developmental stages followed <lb/>by a progressive decrease in expression, whereas genes implicated in schizophrenia show the <lb/>opposite profile: a progressive increase in expression throughout development (Figure 2D). Genes <lb/>associated with autism are expressed throughout prenatal development and subsequently display <lb/>a sharp decrease in expression near birth (Figure 2D). The two temporal profiles in the brain that <lb/>are enriched with microcephaly-and autism-associated genes are also enriched with essential genes <lb/>(P-value &lt; 10 -16 , binomial test). <lb/>Most (86%) disease genes that we analyzed are associated with phenotypes in multiple organs, but <lb/>this still leaves hundreds of genes that affect exclusively one organ. Many of these genes present a <lb/>puzzle in biomedical research because, as previously noted [24,25], they are not expressed in an <lb/>organ-specific manner. Our analysis of developmental transcriptomes further strengthens this <lb/>puzzle. Genes known to cause organ-specific phenotypes exhibit dynamic temporal profiles in a <lb/>similar number of organs as genes causing phenotypes across multiple organs (i.e., median of 4 <lb/>organs for both gene sets; Figure S9A). This raises the question as to why mutations that mostly <lb/>disrupt the coding-sequences of genes temporally dynamic in multiple organs lead to diseases that <lb/>are organ-specific. A number of different factors may explain this phenomenon, including <lb/>alternative splicing (e.g., mutations may affect only organ-specific isoforms) [26], functional <lb/>redundancy [25], and/or dependency on the characteristics of specific cell types (e.g., protein-<lb/>misfolding diseases in long-lived neurons). It has also been suggested that pathologies tend to be <lb/>associated with the organ where the genes display elevated expression [24]. This prompted us to <lb/>ask where genes associated with organ-specific diseases exhibit their maximum expression during <lb/>development. We focused on heart, neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and metabolic diseases (the <lb/>latter tested in association with the liver). We found a strong association between the organ of <lb/>maximum expression during development and the organ where the pathology manifests (Figure <lb/>2E). Thus, we found that 56% of the genes exclusively associated with heart disease show maximal <lb/>expression in the heart (vs. 15% for all genes, P-value = 2 x 10 -16 , binomial test; Figure 2E), that 56% <lb/>of the genes with an exclusively metabolic phenotype show maximal expression in the liver (vs. 19% <lb/>for all genes, P-value = 2 x 10 -16 ; Figure 2E), and that genes exclusively associated with <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>neurodevelopmental diseases are enriched for maximal expression in the brain (39% vs. 32% for all <lb/>genes, P-value = 0.03; Figure 2D). The duration of gene expression may also help to explain organ-<lb/>specific pathologies, at least for heart disease. Genes expressed in multiple organs that have heart-<lb/>specific phenotypes are ubiquitously expressed during heart development but show a significantly <lb/>higher time-specificity (i.e., shorter expression window) in the other organs (all P-value &lt; 10 -4 , <lb/>Wilcoxon rank sum test, two-sided; Figure 2F). We note, however, that time-specificity does not <lb/>help to explain metabolic-or neurodevelopmental-specific phenotypes, as we see no difference in <lb/>the time-specificity of genes in the affected organs versus the others (Figure 2F; Figure S9B). Overall, <lb/>the association of pathology with level of gene expression, and to a lesser extent with duration of <lb/>gene expression, suggest that the development of organ-specific pathologies can at least in some <lb/>cases be explained by differences in the abundance (spatial and/or temporal) of the cell type(s) that <lb/>express the mutated gene in the different organs. <lb/></body>

			<body>Presence/absence expression differences are rare between species <lb/>The extensive use of mice, rats and other mammals in biomedical research is predicated upon the <lb/>assumption of an overall conservation of developmental programs between humans and these <lb/>species. This assumption has been largely supported by comparative analyses of developmental <lb/>expression profiles [13] and by comparative analyses of the human and mouse trans-acting <lb/>regulatory circuitry [27]. However, this broad conservation does not preclude developmental <lb/>expression differences in individual genes that can profoundly impact the translatability of <lb/>phenotypes between humans and other species. <lb/>We first compared human genes and their orthologs in mouse, rat, rabbit and rhesus macaque in <lb/>terms of stark differences in spatiotemporal profiles: presence/absence of gene expression in a <lb/>given organ and large differences in expression pleiotropy across multiple organs. Differences <lb/>between humans and each of the other species in terms of the presence or absence of gene <lb/>expression in an organ are rare. In a comparison of human and mouse, only 1-3% of protein-coding <lb/>genes (177 -372 genes depending on the organ) are robustly expressed (RPKM ≥ 5) in human but <lb/>not in mouse (RPKM ≤ 1). These percentages are similar for the comparisons with the other species <lb/>(i.e., 1-2% of genes robustly expressed in human are not expressed in rat/rabbit/rhesus macaque). <lb/>Although rare, these differences also include disease genes. For example, among genes robustly <lb/>expressed in heart in human but not in mouse are 17 genes associated with heart disease. These <lb/>include NKX2-6, which causes conotruncal heart malformations in human [28] that, congruently, are <lb/>not recapitulated by a mouse knockout [29]. The developmental profile of NKX2-6 in the human <lb/>heart is ancestral; the heart expression was lost specifically in rodents, and this is therefore an <lb/>example of a disease gene that would probably be better studied in the rabbit (Figure 3A). Genes <lb/>associated with neurological diseases are depleted among the set of genes expressed in the human <lb/>but not in the mouse brain (12 differ vs. 28 expected, P-value = 4 x 10 -4 , binomial test). Among the <lb/>exceptions is CHRNA2, a gene expressed in the human brain starting at birth that has been <lb/>implicated in epilepsy [30,31]. Once again, and congruently, this clinical phenotype is not <lb/>recapitulated in the mouse knockout [29] (Figure 2B). <lb/>The global breadth of spatiotemporal expression is also very similar between human genes and their <lb/>orthologs in mouse, rat, rabbit and rhesus macaque. They are highly correlated in terms of their <lb/>organ-specificity (Pearson&apos;s r = 0.85-0.86, all P-value &lt; 10 -16 ), time-specificity (r = 0.68-0.84 for <lb/>individual organs and 0.83-0.84 for median time-specificity, all P-value &lt; 10 -16 ) and, therefore, for <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>global expression pleiotropy (r = 0.84-0.90, all P-value &lt; 10 -16 ). There are only 141 genes expressed <lb/>in at least half the human samples but in fewer than 10% of the mouse samples, and 172 genes with <lb/>the opposite pattern (Figure S9C). These genes are depleted for essential genes (P-value = 8 x 10 -6 , <lb/>binomial test) and disease genes (P-value = 0.02, binomial test). Overall, differences in the breadth <lb/>and presence/absence of gene expression between humans and other species are confined to a <lb/>small set of genes. However, when present, they can translate into relevant phenotypic differences. <lb/>Figure 3. Suitability of the mouse as a model. (A) Developmental profile of NKX2-6 in human, mouse, rat, rabbit and <lb/>opossum. NKX2-6 is robustly expressed in the human heart but not in mouse, and the conotruncal heart malformations <lb/>observed in human are not recapitulated by a mouse knockout. The human heart profile of NKX2-6 is ancestral as it is <lb/>similar to the profiles in rabbit and opossum. (B) Developmental profile of CHRNA2 in human and mouse. CHRNA2 is <lb/>robustly expressed in the human brain but not in mouse, and the epileptic phenotypes observed in human are not <lb/>recapitulated by a mouse knockout. <lb/>Organ-specific temporal differences are common <lb/>It is not uncommon for genes with broad spatiotemporal profiles to evolve new organ <lb/>developmental trajectories in specific species or lineages [13]. Differences between mammalian <lb/>species in organ developmental trajectories were first identified using a phylogenetic approach that <lb/>included distantly related species (i.e., the marsupial opossum which diverged from human ~160 <lb/>million years ago [32]) [13]. Therefore, only a restricted set of human genes was evaluated for <lb/>potential trajectory differences (e.g., 3,980 genes in the brain). Here, we compared the human <lb/>developmental profiles in each of the organs with their orthologs in mouse, rat, rabbit and rhesus <lb/>macaque in a pairwise manner (Methods; Tables S3-S8; because of the shorter rhesus macaque&apos;s <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>time series, this analysis was only performed for brain, heart and liver). This allowed us to duplicate <lb/>or triplicate (depending on the organ) the number of orthologous genes analyzed for differences in <lb/>their developmental trajectories. Figure 4A shows examples of genes with different developmental <lb/>trajectories between human and mouse. <lb/>Consistent with the original study [13], we found differences between the organs in the proportion <lb/>of genes with trajectories differences between humans and each of the other species (Figure 4B): <lb/>differences are highest in testis and liver and lowest in brain. There are also expected differences <lb/>between species: a smaller fraction of genes differs between human and rhesus macaque (diverged <lb/>~29 million years ago) than between human and each of the glires (diverged ~90 million years ago). <lb/>However, we also identified a higher proportion of genes that differ between human and mouse <lb/>than between human and rabbit (despite the same divergence time), a result consistent with the <lb/>original observation that rodents have evolved a larger number of trajectory differences [13]. <lb/>Genes with different developmental trajectories between human and mouse are common: 51% of <lb/>the genes tested differ in at least one organ. Most of these genes (67%) differ in only one organ <lb/>(25% of genes differ in two organs, and 8% differ in 3 or more), despite on average showing dynamic <lb/>temporal profiles in 5-6 organs. Genes with differences in developmental trajectories are depleted <lb/>for TFs (P-value = 2 x 10 -5 , Fisher&apos;s exact test, two-sided) and are functionally enriched for protein <lb/>metabolism (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-value = 1 x 10 -4 , overrepresentation enrichment <lb/>analysis). Interestingly, genes with different trajectories in the brain (but not in the other organs) <lb/>are enriched among a set of genes identified as carrying signs of positive-selection in their coding-<lb/>sequences across mammalian species [33] (P-value = 0.008, Fisher&apos;s exact test). <lb/>The genes depicted in Figure 4A are associated with diseases that affect the organ in which human <lb/>and mouse display different trajectories. For these genes, the disease etiology may not be fully <lb/>recapitulated by mouse models. The mouse knockouts are still expected to affect the development <lb/>of the organ associated with the disease, but the cellular and developmental context of the <lb/>phenotypes in mouse could differ substantially from those in human. It is therefore noteworthy that <lb/>genes associated with human disease are less likely than non-disease genes to differ in their <lb/>trajectories between human and mouse (Figure 4C; and between human and the other species; data <lb/>not shown). Genes causing diseases that affect the brain, heart and liver are significantly depleted <lb/>for trajectory differences between human and mouse in each of the organs (Figure 4C, P-value = <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>0.0006 for the brain, P-value = 0.05 for the heart and P-value = 3 x 10 -5 for the liver, Fisher&apos;s exact <lb/>test). Nevertheless, that leaves more than 200 disease genes whose developmental profiles may <lb/>not be fully recapitulated in the mouse (Figure 4C). <lb/>We also posed the question as to whether genes underlying diseases with different ages of onset <lb/>are equally likely to differ between human and mouse. Although the number of disease genes <lb/>associated with an exclusive congenital or exclusive postnatal onset is low, we found that genes <lb/>with congenital onsets almost never differ in terms of their developmental trajectories between <lb/>human and mouse (i.e., only 1 out of 82 genes causing disease in the brain, heart or liver; Figure 4C) <lb/>whereas genes with postnatal onsets are more likely to show differences (although this difference <lb/>is only statistically significant for the liver, P-value = 0.03, binomial test; Figure 4C). Overall, we <lb/>suggest that for genes with differences in developmental trajectories (Tables S3-S8), existing mouse <lb/>models of human diseases should undergo extra scrutiny and the possibility of studying alternative <lb/>models should be carefully considered. <lb/>Figure 4. Developmental trajectory differences. (A) Examples of human disease genes with different developmental <lb/>trajectories between human and mouse in the affected organ.

			<body>Discussion <lb/>We integrated datasets of human essential and disease genes with developmental gene expression <lb/>profiles in order to shed new light on the causes and phenotypic manifestations of human diseases. <lb/>We found that the breadth of spatiotemporal expression correlates positively with the severity of <lb/>phenotypes and that it differs considerably among genes associated with different disease classes. <lb/>We also found that disease-associated genes are enriched within specific developmental modules <lb/>in the organs affected, and that genes associated with different brain developmental disorders show <lb/>distinct temporal profiles during brain development. There is therefore a clear association between <lb/>spatiotemporal profiles and the phenotypic manifestations of diseases. <lb/>The analysis of developmental transcriptomes further strengthened the apparent paradox of <lb/>ubiquitously expressed genes often having organ-specific phenotypes [24,25]. We could not <lb/>distinguish genes associated with organ-specific phenotypes from those associated with multi-<lb/>organ phenotypes based on the breadth of spatiotemporal profiles. However, for genes associated <lb/>with organ-specific phenotypes, there is a strong association between the organ affected and the <lb/>organ of maximal expression during development. This association suggests that at least some <lb/>organ-specific pathologies could be explained by differences between organs in the spatial and <lb/>temporal abundance of the cells expressing the mutated gene. <lb/>Gene expression links genes with their organismal phenotypes and hence offers a direct means to <lb/>compare both across species. It can, therefore, inform on the likelihood that insights obtained from <lb/>studies in model species are directly transferable to human. We found that stark changes in gene <lb/>expression (e.g., presence/absence of expression) are rare between species. However, they do <lb/>sometimes occur in disease genes, and in these cases, they may explain why for these genes mouse <lb/>models fail to recapitulate the human phenotypes. Strikingly, we also found that differences <lb/>between humans and other species in terms of the genes&apos; temporal trajectories during organ <lb/>development are common. About half of human genes exhibit a different developmental trajectory <lb/>from their mouse orthologs in at least one of the organs. In further support of the use of model <lb/>organisms for disease research, we found that disease genes are less likely to differ than the average <lb/>gene. Nevertheless, we still identified more than 200 genes known to be causally associated with <lb/>brain, heart and/or liver disease, that differ in developmental trajectories between human and <lb/>mouse in the affected organ. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>Different reasons, that are not mutually exclusive, can account for the differences in temporal <lb/>trajectories observed between species. Differences in developmental trajectories can be created by <lb/>gene expression differences between species in homologous cell types, differences between species <lb/>in cellular composition, and/or differences between species in the cell types that express <lb/>orthologous genes. All of these differences can decrease the likelihood that the phenotype <lb/>associated with a human gene will be fully recapitulated in a model species. However, differences <lb/>in trajectories created by changes in the identity of the cell types that express an orthologous gene <lb/>in different species will lead to the greatest phenotypic divergence. Endeavors that seek to clarify <lb/>the causes of trajectory differences therefore represent a key next step, given that they will identify <lb/>further genes and processes that are challenging to model in other species. The use of single-cell <lb/>technologies will greatly aid these efforts [34]. <lb/>Gene expression is only one of several steps connecting genes to their phenotypes. Similarities and <lb/>differences in gene expression between species will not always translate into conserved and <lb/>divergent phenotypes, respectively. This notwithstanding, detailed comparisons of developmental <lb/>gene expression profiles, as performed here, can substantially help to assess the translatability of <lb/>the knowledge gathered on individual genes from model species to humans. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Resource <lb/>From a mammalian resource on organ development [13], we analyzed data from 1,443 strand-<lb/>specific RNA-seq libraries sequenced to a median depth of 33 million reads: 297 from human, 316 <lb/>from mouse (outbred strain CD-1 -RjOrl:SWISS), 350 from rat (outbred strain Holtzman SD), 315 <lb/>from rabbit (outbred New Zealand breed) and 165 from rhesus macaque. The organs, <lb/>developmental stages and replicates sampled in each species are described in Table S9. The mouse <lb/>time series started at e10.5 and there were prenatal samples available for each day until birth (i.e., <lb/>e18.5). There were postnatal samples for 5 stages: P0, P3, P14, P28 and P63. The rat time series <lb/>started at e11 and there were prenatal samples available for each day until birth (i.e., e20). There <lb/>were postnatal samples for 6 stages: P0, P3, P7, P14, P42 and P112. The rabbit time series started <lb/>at e12 and there were 11 prenatal stages available up to and until e27 (gestation lasts ~ 29-32 days). <lb/>There were postnatal samples for 4 stages: P0, P14, P84 and P186-P548. Finally, the time series for <lb/>rhesus macaque started at a late fetal stage (e93) and there were 5 prenatal stages available up to <lb/>and until e130 (gestation last ~ 167 days). There were postnatal samples for 8 stages: P0, P23, 5-6 <lb/>months of age, 1 year, 3 years, 9 years, 14-15 years, and 20-26 years. For mouse, rat and rabbit <lb/>there were typically 4 replicates (2 males and 2 females) per stage, except for ovary and testis (2 <lb/>replicates). For human and rhesus macaque, the median number of replicates was 2. <lb/>Gene co-expression networks <lb/>We built gene co-expression networks using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA 1.61) <lb/>[35]. We used as input data the read counts after applying the variance stabilizing (VS) <lb/>transformation implemented in DESeq2 (1.12.4) [36]. Each stage was represented by the median <lb/>across replicates. In addition to protein-coding genes, we included a set of 5,887 lncRNAs that show <lb/>significant differential temporal expression in at least one organ and that show multiple signatures <lb/>for being enriched with functional genes [19]. We only excluded genes that failed to reach an RPKM <lb/>(reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) across all stages and organs higher <lb/>than 1. Using WGCNA we built a signed network (based on the correlation across all stages and <lb/>organs) using a power of 10 and default parameters. We then correlated the eigengenes for each <lb/>module with the sample traits (i.e., organ and developmental stage). <lb/>We characterized each module in terms of biological processes and disease enrichments (GLAD4U) <lb/>using the R implementation of WebGestalt (FDR ≤ 0.01; version 0.0.5) [37]. The lists of TFs are from <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>the animalTFDB (version 2.0) [17], the list of RNA-binding proteins are from the work of Gerstberger <lb/>and colleagues [18], and the lists of genes from the main signaling pathways are from the following <lb/>Gene Ontology (GO) categories: GO:0016055 (Wnt signaling pathway); GO:0007179 (transforming <lb/>growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway); GO:0007224 (hedgehog signaling pathway); <lb/>GO:0007169 (transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway); GO:0030522 <lb/>(intracellular receptor signaling pathway); GO:0007259 (JAK-STAT cascade); and GO:0007219 <lb/>(Notch signaling pathway). <lb/>Inherited disease genes <lb/>The list of genes associated with human inherited disease was obtained from the manually curated <lb/>HGMD (PRO 17.1) [23]. We only used genes with disease-causing mutations (DM tag; Table S2). <lb/>Genes associated with DM mutations were mapped onto the Unified Medical Language System <lb/>(UMLS), and aggregated into one or more of the following high level disease types: Eye, Nervous <lb/>system, Reproductive, Cancer, Skin, Heart, Blood, Blood Coagulation, Endocrine, Immune, Digestive, <lb/>Genitourinary, Metabolic, Ear Nose &amp; Throat, Respiratory, Developmental, Musculoskeletal, and <lb/>Psychiatric [23]. We also characterized the developmental profiles of 15 genes with dynamic <lb/>temporal profiles in the brain that are associated with primary microcephaly (out of a set of 16 genes <lb/>associated with this condition [38]), 171 associated with autism (out of 233 [39]) and 46 associated <lb/>with schizophrenia (out of 75 [40]; we only considered loci where at most two genes were <lb/>associated with the causative variant). There were only 7 genes with dynamic temporal profiles in <lb/>the brain associated with both autism and schizophrenia. The list of human essential genes was <lb/>obtained from the work of Bartha and colleagues [22]. <lb/>The time-and organ-specificity indexes were based on the Tau metric of tissue-specificity [41] and <lb/>were retrieved from the developmental resource [13]. Both indexes range from 0 (broad expression) <lb/>to 1 (restricted expression). The pleiotropy index is to the number of samples where a gene is <lb/>expressed (RPKM &gt; 1) over the total number of samples. <lb/>The most common temporal profiles in each organ were identified using the soft-clustering <lb/>approach (c-means) implemented in the R package mFuzz (2.32.0) [42,43]. The clustering was <lb/>restricted to genes previously identified as showing significant temporal differential expression in <lb/>each organ (i.e., developmentally dynamic genes) [13]. We used as input the VS-transformed <lb/>counts. The number of clusters was set to 6-8 depending on the organ. <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>Comparing developmental trajectories <lb/>For each organ, we compared the developmental trajectories of orthologous genes previously <lb/>identified as showing significant temporal differential expression [13]. We used as input the VS-<lb/>transformed counts (median across replicates) for matching stages between human and each of the <lb/>other species. The developmental stage correspondences across species were retrieved from the <lb/>developmental resource [13]. We used GPClust [44-46], which clusters time-series using Gaussian <lb/>processes, to cluster the combined data for human and each of the other species. We set the noise <lb/>variance (k2.variance.fix) to 0.7 and let GPClust infer the number of clusters. For each gene, GPClust <lb/>assigned the probability of it belonging to each of the clusters. Therefore, for each gene we obtained <lb/>a vector of probabilities that could be directly compared between pairs of 1:1 orthologs. We <lb/>calculated the probability that pairs of orthologs were in the same cluster and used an FDR cut off <lb/>of 5% to identify the genes that differed in trajectory between human and each of the other species. <lb/>In Tables S3-S8, we provide for each organ and species the P-values (adjusted for multiple testing <lb/>using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [47]) for the null hypothesis that orthologs have the same <lb/>trajectory, and their classification as &apos;same&apos; or &apos;different&apos; based on an FDR of 5%. <lb/>General statistics and plots. Statistical analyses and plots were done in R (3.3.2) [48]. Plots were <lb/>created using the R packages ggplot2 (2.2.1) [49], gridExtra (2.2.1) [50], reshape2 (1.4.2) [51], plyr <lb/>(1.8.4) [52], and factoextra (1.0.4) [53]. <lb/></body>
