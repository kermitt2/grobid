			<body>magnetocaloric effect (MCE) observed in some of these <lb/>compounds makes them suitable candidates for magnetic <lb/>refrigeration technology [1, 2]. Materials showing promise <lb/>for magnetic refrigeration applications must exhibit a first-<lb/>order magnetic phase transition [3]. In this context, RCo 2 <lb/>intermetallic compounds are among the attractive candi-<lb/>dates. According to [4, 5], the ferrimagnetic-paramagnetic <lb/>phase transformations in RCo 2 compounds with heavy rare-<lb/>earth elements are first-order transitions, and, thus, these <lb/>compounds exhibit a large magnetic entropy change. The <lb/>magnetic moment at Co atoms in RCo 2 compounds is <lb/>induced by exchange interaction with rare-earth moments <lb/>[6, 7]. The Co-atom moments in the light rare-earth com-<lb/>pounds range from 0.5 to 0.8 µ B , while the moments <lb/>are almost unchanged (˜1.0 µ B ) for the compounds with <lb/>the heavy rare-earth elements. The induced moments are <lb/>aligned in parallel to the 4f moments in the light rare-earth <lb/>compounds and are antiparallel in the heavy rare-earth com-<lb/>pounds [8]. DyCo 2 , HoCo 2 and ErCo 2 were selected from a <lb/>great number of intermetallic compounds; their Curie tem-<lb/>peratures are 140, 76 and 35 K, respectively [9]. According <lb/>to data of Tishin et al. [10] for the parent compounds, the <lb/>maximum magnitude T ad at a field change μ 0 H of 10 T <lb/>for DyCo 2 at 141 K, HoCo 2 at 84 K and ErCo 2 at 36 K <lb/>reaches 9.6, 10 and 10.8 K, respectively. The theoretical <lb/>calculations performed by Oliveira suggest that composite <lb/>materials made up of several samples of the doped com-<lb/>pounds R 1-x R x Co 2 (where R, R = rare earth elements) <lb/>can be very useful to work as magnetic refrigerant in the <lb/>intermediate range of temperature, for example 100-200 K <lb/>[11]. The authors have shown that the nature of the magnetic <lb/>phase transformation retains the first-order transition for all <lb/>the pseudobinary compounds. In the present work I want to <lb/>respond to above suggestion and perform the comparative <lb/>analysis of their magnetic and magnetocaloric properties. <lb/></body>

			<body>2 Experimental Details <lb/>Polycrystalline samples of R 1-x R x Co 2 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) solid <lb/>solutions were prepared by arc-melting using a water-cooled <lb/>copper crucible and a high purity argon atmosphere. The <lb/>high-purity starting materials (Co 99.99 % purity and rare-<lb/>earth metals 99.9 % purity) were taken in stoichiometric <lb/>proportions. The alloys were melted repeatedly (four times) <lb/>to ensure the adequate homogeneity. The mass losses after <lb/>the melting were less than 1 wt %. The buttons obtained <lb/>were wrapped in a tantalum foil, sealed in evacuated quartz <lb/>ampoules, and annealed at 700 o C for four weeks. <lb/>The crystal structure and the phase purity of the samples <lb/>were determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analy-<lb/>sis. Temperature dependences of the DC magnetic suscepti-<lb/>bility were measured at 4.2 -290 K in a static magnetic field <lb/>of 0.03 T using a superconducting quantum interference <lb/>device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design). Magne-<lb/>tization measurements were carried out using a vibration <lb/>sample magnetometer with a step motor in an applied field <lb/>up to maximum 14 T using a Bitter-type magnet. The heat <lb/>capacity was measured using Quantum Design PPMS 14 <lb/>Heat Capacity System in a temperature range of 2 -295 K <lb/>without the magnetic field and in a magnetic field of 0.5, 1, <lb/>1.5 and 2 T. <lb/>Isothermal magnetic entropy change S H and adiabatic <lb/>temperature change T ad has been estimated using the heat <lb/>capacity data. <lb/>3 Results and Discussion <lb/>The principal magnetic parameters and crystallographic <lb/>data of investigated samples are collected in Table 1. As <lb/>it seen, all the solid solutions under study are found to <lb/>have the cubic C15 Laves phase, MgCu 2 -type struc-<lb/>ture. The lattice parameters for all R 1-x R x Co 2 compounds <lb/>decreases with increasing R content. For Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 and <lb/>Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 when a part of Dy atoms is substituted by <lb/>Ho and Er, accordingly, the T C values decreases. Simi-<lb/>larly situation is observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 the added Er <lb/>atoms decreases T C of Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 solid solutions. Mag-<lb/>netization isotherms of all the R 1-x R x Co 2 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) <lb/>solid solutions were measured at selected temperatures in <lb/>the vicinity of their ordering temperatures in a maximum <lb/>applied magnetic field of 5 T. As an example, the magnetiza-<lb/>tion isotherms measured for Dy 0.6 Ho 0.4 Co 2 at temperatures <lb/>of from 104 to 152 K are illustrated in Fig. 1. It was found <lb/>that, above T C = 113 K, the metamagnetic behavior charac-<lb/>terized by hysteretic transitions in magnetization curves is <lb/>observed. The decrease in the critical field of metamagnetic <lb/>transitions and magnetization jumps occur with increasing <lb/>temperature. The presence of a metamagnetic transition in <lb/>the compounds studied is seen not only in the magnetization <lb/>isotherms but also in the corresponding Belov-Arrott plots <lb/>which are usually used to determine the transition order of <lb/>magnetic materials [12, 13]. On the one hand, if negative <lb/>slopes or inflection points are found in Belov-Arrott plot <lb/>curves, they often indicate a first-order transition. On the <lb/>other hand, if the Belov-Arrott plot above T C displays an <lb/>almost linear behavior, it implies that a second-order mag-<lb/>netic transition occurs. As an example, the Belov-Arrott <lb/>plots for Ho 0.6 Er 0.4 Co 2 are shown in Fig. 2. The inflection <lb/>point above T C (56 K) suggests the occurrence of a metam-<lb/>agnetic transition from paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic order. <lb/>The S-shape curves in Fig. 2 indicate a first-order type tran-<lb/>sition in this sample. The same trend is observed for all <lb/>R 1-x R x Co 2 solid solutions with 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5. <lb/>According to the metamagnetic behaviour plays a critical <lb/>role in determining the order of a magnetic transition which <lb/>influences directly the magnitude of magnetocaloric effect. <lb/>In order to confirm that present series showed first-order <lb/>transitions, it has used the Inoue-Shimizu s-d model [14], <lb/>which has been widely used to discuss behavior of several <lb/>types of magnetocaloric materials. In this model, a Landau <lb/>expansion of magnetic free energy up to the sixth power of <lb/>total magnetization M is used : <lb/>F = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>a (T) M 2 + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/>b (T) M 4 + <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/>c (T) M 6 + .... − µ 0 MH (1) <lb/>The Landau coefficients are accessible through the equation <lb/>of state linking M and the magnetic field : <lb/>µ 0 H = a (T) M + b (T) M 3 + c (T) M 5 <lb/>(2) <lb/>The coefficients a(T), b(T) and c(T) depend on the temper-<lb/>ature with respect to a thermal variation of spin fluctuations <lb/>amplitude and can be determined by fitting the magnetiza-<lb/>tion isothermal data using the above equation. Examination <lb/>of the free energy demonstrates that the parameter a(T) is <lb/>always positive and would get a minimum value at the Curie <lb/>temperature corresponding to a maximum of susceptibility. <lb/>On other hand, the order of magnetic transition is governed <lb/>by the sign of b(T): the 1st order transition takes place <lb/>if b(T C ) &lt; 0, while the 2nd order transition occurs when <lb/>b(T C ) ≥ 0. Besides, c(T) is positive at T C and, in the other <lb/>temperature regions, can be negative or positive. The val-<lb/>ues of Landau&apos;s coefficients are determined by fitting the <lb/>magnetization traces to (2). <lb/>Accordingly, b(T) is found to be negative for all <lb/>R 1-x R x Co 2 studied indicating the 1st order of magnetic <lb/>transition for entire series. As example, Fig. 3 shows the <lb/>temperature dependence of Landau coefficients a(T), b(T) <lb/>and c(T) for Dy 0.5 Ho 0.5 Co 2 compound. As explained, a(T) <lb/>is positive with a minimum at T C , corresponding to a max-<lb/>imum in the susceptibility curve. The b(T) value at T C is <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 6 The maximum value of <lb/>T ad vs. T for R 1-x R x Co 2 <lb/>compounds <lb/>where C H is the experimental dependence of heat capacity <lb/>measured in magnetic field, and <lb/>S H = <lb/>T <lb/>0 <lb/>C H <lb/>T <lb/>dT <lb/>(6) <lb/>is isothermal entropy change calculated from heat capacity <lb/>data [10]. <lb/>Figure 6 summarizes the experimental temperature <lb/>dependences of maximum T ad values for all solid solu-<lb/>tions under study in applying magnetic field of 2 T for <lb/>Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 and Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 , and 1.5 T for Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 . <lb/>As can be seen, the maximum peak value increases with <lb/>increasing R content. In the case of Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 , the <lb/>increase is more pronounced and ranges from 4 K (x =0.1) <lb/>to 7 K (x = 0.5). For Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 , the maximum peak <lb/>value fluctuates within 3-4 K, while for Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 ˜3 K. <lb/>4 Conclusion <lb/>Comparison of the influence of doping effect in pseudo-<lb/>binary R 1-x R x Co 2 (R, R -rare earth) solid solutions on the <lb/>structure and some physical properties has been studied <lb/>experimentally. It was confirmed that the main phase in all <lb/>solid solutions has the cubic C15 structure. The substitu-<lb/>tion of Ho and Er for Dy in Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 and Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 <lb/>results in the decrease of the ordering temperature. The <lb/>same trend is observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 when Ho is sub-<lb/>stituted by Er. Analysis of magnetic ordering transition <lb/>using the Landau theory and Belov-Arrot plots reveals the <lb/>occurrence of the first-order phase transition in all sample, <lb/>which confirms the theoretical considerations performed by <lb/>Oliveira [11]. <lb/>Results of the heat capacity measurements agree well <lb/>with those of magnetic studies and confirm the fact that <lb/>the substitution of R for RR Co 2 decreases the magnetic <lb/>ordering temperature. In addition to changes associated with <lb/>the magnetic transition, the anomalies caused by the mag-<lb/>netic spin reorientation are observed in the curves C(T) and <lb/>χ g (T). <lb/>It should be noted that the decrease in T C is accompanied <lb/>by increase in magnetocaloric properties in all measured <lb/>solid solutions. Among the presented sample, the best MCE <lb/>was observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 solid solutions. <lb/>Summarizing, the presented compounds display the <lb/>higher MCE values, which make them candidates for mag-<lb/>netic refrigeration applications in intermediate (50-140 K) <lb/>temperature regions. <lb/></body>
