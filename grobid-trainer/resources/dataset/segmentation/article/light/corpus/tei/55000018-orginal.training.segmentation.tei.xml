			<body>1. RET proto-oncogene <lb/>RET was originally identified as an oncogene acti-<lb/>vated by DNA rearrangement in 1985 [1 -3]. The RET <lb/>proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with <lb/>a cadherin-related motif and a cysteine-rich domain in <lb/>the extracellular domain and is located on chromosome <lb/>10q11.2. [4-7]. So far, three isoforms (short, middle <lb/>and long isoforms) that are generated by alternative <lb/>splicing in the 3% region have been cloned [8,9] (Fig. <lb/>1A). <lb/>RET expression was detected in human tumors of <lb/>neural crest origin such as neuroblastoma, pheochro-<lb/>mocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma [10 -12]. <lb/>In rodent embryonic and adult tissues, it is highly <lb/>expressed in peripheral enteric, sympathetic and sensory <lb/>neurons as well as central motor, dopamine and nora-<lb/>drenalin neurons [13 -17], suggesting an important role <lb/>of Ret in differentiation and survival of these neurons. <lb/>In addition to the nervous system, Ret expression is <lb/>observed in the excretory system such as mesonephric <lb/>duct and branching ureteric bud during embryogenesis <lb/>although it almost disappears after birth [13,15]. Con-<lb/>sistent with its expression pattern, Ret knockout mice <lb/>showed lack of enteric neurons and superior cervical <lb/>ganglion as well as renal agenesis or dysgenesis [18,19]. <lb/>Moreover, based on the precise studies of the mutant <lb/>mice, it was demonstrated that a common pool of <lb/>neural crest cells derived from the postotic hindbrain <lb/>gives rise to most of the enteric nervous system and the <lb/>superior cervical ganglion, depending on the c-Ret <lb/>function [19]. <lb/>The RET proto-oncogene was identified as the <lb/>causative gene for human papillary thyroid carcinoma, <lb/>multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, <lb/>and Hirschsprung&apos;s disease (HSCR) [20 -26]. Ten rear-<lb/>ranged forms of RET referred to as RET/PTC1-9 and <lb/>ELKS/RET have been cloned from sporadic and radia-<lb/>tion-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas [27 -29]. <lb/>The intracellular domain of RET was fused to each <lb/>amino-terminal sequence of nine different activating <lb/>genes including H4 (for RET/PTC1), RIa (RET/ <lb/>PTC2), ELE1(RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC4), RFG5 <lb/>(RET/PTC5), hTIF (RET/PTC6), RFG7 (RET/PTC7), <lb/>kinectin (RET/PTC8), RFG9 (RET/PTC9) and ELKS <lb/>(ELKS/RET). Among these, the RET/PTC1 gene was <lb/>most frequently detected in sporadic papillary thyroid <lb/>carcinoma, although the frequency of RET rearrange-<lb/>ment was very different among countries. It was high <lb/>(10 -35%) in papillary carcinoma from Europe and the <lb/>United States [30,31] whereas it was very low (B 5%) in <lb/>those from Japan and Saudi Arabia [32 -34]. This may <lb/>be due to racial differences in the genetic background <lb/>or to environmental factors in these countries. <lb/>In addition, it turned out that RET rearrangement <lb/>occurred at high frequency (60 -70%) in papillary thy-<lb/>roid carcinoma of children from areas contaminated by <lb/>the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident [35 -37]. In <lb/>contrast to sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma from <lb/>the adult patients, a high predominance of RET/PTC3 <lb/>(approx. a 3:1 ratio of RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC1) <lb/>was observed in these childhood papillary thyroid car-<lb/>cinomas. Interestingly, several reports demonstrated <lb/>that different types of RET rearrangement confer dis-<lb/>tinct phenotypic properties on neoplastic thyroid cells <lb/>[38 -41]. That is, RET/PTC3 was frequently found in <lb/>solid/follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma <lb/>whereas RET/PTC1 was more common in typical pap-<lb/>illary type. Moreover, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 ap-<lb/>peared to be associated with post-Chernobyl papillary <lb/>carcinomas of long and short latency, respectively [40]. <lb/>Because similar RET rearrangement can be induced in <lb/>cell lines by in vitro X-irradiation and was found in <lb/>thyroid tumors from patients who had received external <lb/>radiation [42 -44], it seems likely that post-Chernobyl <lb/>papillary carcinomas developed as a direct consequence <lb/>of radiation exposure. <lb/>RET mutations identified in MEN 2A, MEN 2B and <lb/>HSCR, and their biological effects are described in <lb/>detail in the separate sections. <lb/>Fig. 1.

			<body>Fig. 2. Intracellular signaling pathways mediated by activated RET. <lb/>2. GDNF family ligands and their receptors <lb/>The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor <lb/>(GDNF) family ligands (GDNF, neurturin (NRTN), <lb/>artemin (ARTN) and persephin (PSPN)) form a new <lb/>family of neurotrophic factors that are structurally <lb/>related to transforming growth factor (TGF)-b [45-48]. <lb/>These factors contain seven conserved, similarly spaced <lb/>cysteine residues, referred to as a cysteine knot motif, <lb/>and show approximately 40% amino acid identity each <lb/>other. GDNF, NRTN and ARTN were reported to <lb/>support the survival of a broad spectrum of both <lb/>peripheral and central neurons, whereas PSPN pro-<lb/>moted the survival of motor and nigral dopaminergic <lb/>neurons in culture as well as in vivo but did not support <lb/>the survival of any peripheral neurons examined. <lb/>Unlike ligands for other receptor tyrosine kinases, <lb/>the GDNF family ligands signal through a unique <lb/>multicomponent receptor complex consisting of glyco-<lb/>syl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coreceptor <lb/>(GFRa1 -4) as a ligand binding component and RET <lb/>receptor tyrosine kinase as a signaling component (Fig. <lb/>2) [48 -70]. GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN use <lb/>GFRa1, GFRa2, GFRa3 and GFRa4 as the preferred <lb/>ligand-binding receptors, respectively, although alterna-<lb/>tive ligand-coreceptor interaction also appears to occur <lb/>in culture. That is, GDNF can bind to GFRa2 and <lb/>GFRa3 in the presence of RET, and NRTN and <lb/>ARTN can bind to GFRa1 [48,55,57,58,60]. In addi-<lb/>tion, consistent with the fact that a cadherin-related <lb/>motif is present in the RET extracellular domain, Ca 2 + <lb/>ions were required for RET activation by GDNF and <lb/>NRTN [56]. <lb/>Despite the promiscuity in ligand-receptor specificity <lb/>in culture, however, each of the GDNF family ligands <lb/>showed a rather specific role in vivo through the pre-<lb/>ferred GFRa -RET complex. Gdnf −/− or Gfra1 −/− <lb/>mice exhibited phenotypes similar to that of Ret −/− <lb/>mice [18,71-75]. These mice lacked enteric neurons <lb/>and showed renal agenesis or dysgenesis, although <lb/>the superior cervical ganglion that Ret −/− mice lacked <lb/>was normal or moderately affected in Gdnf −/− or <lb/>Gfra1 −/− mice. In Nrtn −/− or Gfra2 −/− mice, the <lb/>parasympathetic cholinergic innervation was dramati-<lb/>cally reduced in the lacrimal and submandibular sali-<lb/>vary glands as well as in the intestine [76,77]. Gfra3 −/− <lb/>mice exhibited severe defects in the superior cervical <lb/>ganglion whereas other ganglia appeared normal [78]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Taken together, it is likely that the preferred ligand-<lb/>GFRa -RET complexes have specific roles in vivo, <lb/>although Artn −/− , Pspn −/− or Gfra4 −/− mice have <lb/>not been reported yet. <lb/>3. The signaling pathways via GDNF/GFRa1/RET <lb/>complex <lb/>Since GDNF was discovered to represent a RET <lb/>ligand, extensive studies on intracellular signaling <lb/>through RET have been performed. Like other receptor <lb/>tyrosine kinases, RET can activate various signaling <lb/>pathways including RAS/extracellular signal-regulated <lb/>kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ <lb/>AKT, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) <lb/>and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways [79-92]. <lb/>It is well known that these signals are transmitted via <lb/>phosphotyrosine present in the intracellular domains of <lb/>activated receptors. RET short and middle isoforms <lb/>contain 16 tyrosine residues in their intracellular do-<lb/>mains and RET long isoform has two additional tyrosi-<lb/>nes in the carboxy-terminal tail. Among these tyrosines, <lb/>tyrosine 905, 1015, 1062 and 1096 represent binding <lb/>sites for GRB10, phospholipase Cg (PLCg), SHC/ <lb/>SNT(FRS2)/Enigma and GRB2, respectively (Fig. 1A) <lb/>[82,93 -100]. The former three tyrosines are conserved <lb/>in all three RET isoforms but tyrosine 1096 is present <lb/>in the long isoform only. Although the sequence <lb/>around tyrosine 981 matches the consensus sequence <lb/>for binding of p85 subunit of PI3K, it does not appear <lb/>to directly bind to RET as described below. <lb/>Interestingly, our recent results demonstrated that all <lb/>of the RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, p38MAPK and JNK <lb/>pathways are activated mainly through tyrosine 1062 <lb/>that is a binding site for SHC adaptor proteins [92]. <lb/>After binding of SHC to tyrosine 1062 following <lb/>GDNF stimulation, SHC further associates with <lb/>GAB1/2 adaptor proteins and GRB2/SOS complex, <lb/>leading to the activation of PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK <lb/>signaling pathways, respectively (Fig. 2). GAB1/2 di-<lb/>rectly associates with p85 subunit of PI3K, resulting in <lb/>the activation of PI3K [86,92,101]. However, the fact <lb/>that mutation of tyrosine 1062 did not completely <lb/>abolish the activation of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT <lb/>pathways suggested the presence of alternative path-<lb/>ways. Besset et al. [101] reported that because AKT but <lb/>not ERK activation was almost completely abolished <lb/>by double mutations of tyrosines 1062 and 1096, bind-<lb/>ing of GRB2/GAB2 complex to tyrosine 1096 may <lb/>offer an alternative route for activation of the PI3K/ <lb/>AKT signaling pathway. Unexpectedly, although ty-<lb/>rosine 1096 represents a binding site for GRB2 (Fig. <lb/>1A), it does not appear that GRB2 biding to this <lb/>tyrosine plays an important role in the activation of the <lb/>RAS/ERK signaling pathway [92,101]. We and others <lb/>found that the RAS/ERK and PI3K pathways via <lb/>tyrosine 1062 are important for activation of CREB <lb/>and NFkB transcription factors, respectively, [92] as <lb/>well as for PC12 cell survival (Fig. 2) [102]. In addition, <lb/>RAS activation was essential for RET-induced cell <lb/>differentiation in PC12 cells [103] whereas PI3K signal-<lb/>ing independent of AKT was necessary for lamellipodia <lb/>formation that is a critical event in neuritegenesis (Fig. <lb/>2) [81,100]. <lb/>SNT/FRS2 is a lipid anchored docking protein with <lb/>a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. We recently <lb/>found that SNT/FRS2 binds to tyrosine 1062 of RET <lb/>in a GDNF-dependent manner and is associated with <lb/>GRB2/SOS complex but not GAB1, suggesting that <lb/>SNT/FRS2 may be involved mainly in the activation of <lb/>the RAS/ERK signaling pathway (Fig. 2) [104]. These <lb/>findings imply that tyrosine 1062 in RET provides a site <lb/>for the interaction of multiple signaling molecules and <lb/>that the balance of SHC and SNT/FRS2 binding may <lb/>affect the nature of the intracellular signaling in RET-<lb/>expressing cells. Interestingly, it was suggested that <lb/>RET which moved to lipid rafts following GDNF <lb/>stimulation triggers the signal through SNT/FRS2 <lb/>whereas RET outside rafts triggers it through SHC <lb/>(Fig. 2) [105]. <lb/>The binding affinity of SHC and SNT/FRS2 to RET <lb/>was different among three isoforms, although the con-<lb/>sensus sequence for binding of the phosphotyrosine <lb/>binding (PTB) domain of SHC and SNT/FRS2 is con-<lb/>served in the sequence amino-terminal to tyrosine 1062 <lb/>in them (Fig. 1B) [104]. Their binding affinity to RET <lb/>middle isoform was significantly low compared with <lb/>that to RET short and long isoforms. Because the <lb/>sequences carboxy-terminal to tyrosine 1062 were dif-<lb/>ferent among three isoforms (Fig. 1B), this suggested <lb/>the importance of these carboxy-terminal sequences for <lb/>the binding of SHC and SNT/FRS PTB domains [104]. <lb/>In addition, their low binding affinity to RET middle <lb/>isoform was in agreement with the fact that transform-<lb/>ing activity of RET middle isoform with MEN2A mu-<lb/>tation was much lower than that of RET short or long <lb/>isoform with MEN2A mutation [106]. <lb/>The p38MAPK, JNK and MEK5/big mitogen-acti-<lb/>vated protein kinase 1 (BMK1) pathways are also <lb/>activated through tyrosine 1062 [92,107]. Although it is <lb/>unknown whether SHC or SNT/FRS2 binding to ty-<lb/>rosine 1062 is required for activation of these pathways, <lb/>activation of the JNK pathway by mutant RET protein <lb/>was shown to be induced via Rho/Rac-related small <lb/>GTPase, such as CDC42 [84]. Because it is possible that <lb/>the PI3K signaling regulates the functions of these <lb/>small G proteins following GDNF stimulation, the <lb/>JNK pathway may be downstream of PI3K. In addi-<lb/>tion, tyrosine phosphorylation of several other signal-<lb/>ing molecules including FAK, paxillin, p130 CAS and <lb/>p62Dok was induced by PI3K signaling [85,86]. Among <lb/></body>

			<body>these proteins, phosphorylation of FAK was Rho-de-<lb/>pendent (Fig. 2) whereas phosphorylation of paxillin <lb/>and p130 CAS was Rho-independent. <lb/>More recently, the presence of RET-independent sig-<lb/>nals triggered by GDNF was suggested [88,108]. <lb/>GDNF was able to activate Src-type kinases and PLCg <lb/>in sensory neurons from Ret −/− mice and Src kinases <lb/>were associated with GFRa1 in Triton-insoluble frac-<lb/>tions including lipid rafts. GDNF also promoted the <lb/>survival of cultured neuronal cells expressing GFRa1 <lb/>but lacking RET, and induced CREB and Fos activa-<lb/>tion in them [88,108]. Because the phenotypes of <lb/>Gdnf −/− and Gfra1 −/− mice were very similar to that <lb/>of Ret −/− mice, these findings suggested that RET-in-<lb/>dependent GDNF signaling through GFRa1 may play <lb/>a role postnatally in neuronal functions rather than <lb/>neuronal differentiation during embryogenesis. <lb/>4. RET mutations and multiple endocrine neoplasia <lb/>type 2 <lb/>4.1. RET mutations in MEN 2 <lb/>Germline RET mutations are responsible for devel-<lb/>opment of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types <lb/>2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma <lb/>(FMTC) [21 -24,109]. MEN2A and MEN2B are auto-<lb/>somal dominant cancer syndromes characterized by <lb/>medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. <lb/>In addition to these, parathyroid hyperplasia develops <lb/>in 10-30% of the affected members of MEN 2A <lb/>families. MEN 2B patients are known to develop <lb/>medullary thyroid carcinoma with an earlier age of <lb/>tumor onset and show a more complex phenotype <lb/>including ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal <lb/>tract and mucosa, medullated corneal nerves, and mar-<lb/>fanoid habitus. FMTC is characterized by medullary <lb/>thyroid carcinoma only that usually develops at a later <lb/>stage in life. <lb/>MEN2A mutations have been identified in one of six <lb/>cysteine residues (codons 609, 611, 618 and 620 in exon <lb/>10, and codons 630 and 634 in exon 11) in the RET <lb/>extracellular domain [109]. In FMTC, point mutations <lb/>were detected at cysteine residues like MEN2A muta-<lb/>tions or at codon 768, 804 or 891 (exons 13, 14 or 15) <lb/>in the tyrosine kinase domain [109]. In addition, a 9 or <lb/>12 base pair duplication in exon 11 and a 9 base pair <lb/>duplication in exon 8 that create an additional cysteine <lb/>residue were reported in two MEN 2A families and one <lb/>FMTC family, respectively [110-112]. Although mis-<lb/>sense mutations at codon 790 or 791 were reported in <lb/>five German FMTC or MEN 2A families [113], these <lb/>have not been identified in families from any other <lb/>countries. <lb/>Two missense point mutations at codon 918 (exon <lb/>16) or codon 883 (exon 15) were associated with MEN <lb/>2B [109]. Methionine at codon 918 and alanine at <lb/>codon 883 were replaced with threonine and phenylala-<lb/>nine (designated M918T and A883F), respectively. <lb/>More than 95% of MEN 2B patients are accounted for <lb/>by the M918T mutation but fewer than 4% are ac-<lb/>counted for by the A883F mutation. Recently, double <lb/>germline mutations at codon 804 and 806 were reported <lb/>in a Japanese patient that had clinical features charac-<lb/>teristic of MEN 2B including medullary carcinoma, <lb/>mucosal neuroma, marfanoid habitus, thickening of <lb/>corneal nerves (grade 4) and medullary hyperplasia of <lb/>bilateral adrenal gland [114,115]. <lb/>4.2. Genotype-phenotype correlations in MEN 2 <lb/>We and others demonstrated that all of MEN2A, <lb/>MEN2B and FMTC mutations except mutations of <lb/>codons 790 and 791 can induce constitutive activation <lb/>of RET proteins [115-123]. As a consequence, RET <lb/>became the first case that gain-of-function mutations of <lb/>a proto-oncogene were implicated in the etiology of an <lb/>inherited cancer syndrome. Cysteine mutations iden-<lb/>tified in the MEN 2A and FMTC families activate RET <lb/>by inducing its disulfide-linked homodimerization <lb/>(Table 1) [116,117]. These cysteine residues are thought <lb/>to be normally involved in the formation of intramolec-<lb/>ular disulfide bonds that are necessary for appropriate <lb/>tertiary structure of the RET extracellular domain. Our <lb/>hypothesis on RET activation by the MEN2A mutation <lb/>is that when a cysteine residue is mutated to a non-cys-<lb/>teine residue, a partner cysteine that is involved in the <lb/>formation of a disulfide bond may become free and <lb/>form an aberrant intermolecular disulfide bond between <lb/>two mutant RET, leading to the constitutive activation <lb/>of intrinsic tyrosine kinase. <lb/>In the cases of MEN2B mutations identified in the <lb/>tyrosine kinase domain, RET was activated in a <lb/>monomeric form, probably due to a conformational <lb/>change of catalytic core of the kinase domain [117-<lb/>119]. Several reports suggested that the MEN2B muta-<lb/>tions alter the substrate specificity of the RET protein <lb/>[86,117,124,125], although which signaling pathway is <lb/>important for development of the MEN 2B clinical <lb/>phenotype is still unclear. In addition, we found that <lb/>tyrosine residues in the kinase domain essential for <lb/>transforming activity are different between RET-<lb/>MEN2A and RET-MEN2B mutant proteins. That is, <lb/>tyrosine 905 and tyrosines 864 and 952 were required <lb/>for the activity of RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B <lb/>proteins, respectively (Table 1) [119,123]. It is well <lb/>known that a tyrosine residue is conserved in all ty-<lb/>rosine kinases at the same position as tyrosine 905 in <lb/>RET and plays an crucial role in their biological and <lb/>biochemical activities. Because the MEN2B mutations <lb/></body>

			<body>at codons 918 and 883 are located near tyrosine 905, a <lb/>conformational change in the region including these <lb/>amino acids may result in the shift of tyrosine residues <lb/>(tyrosine 905 tyrosines 864 and 952) that are required <lb/>for transforming activity of the RET-MEN2B mutant <lb/>protein. <lb/>Recently, a novel V804M/Y806C double mutation <lb/>was identified in a Japanese female MEN2B patient <lb/>[114]. These two mutations were present in the same <lb/>allele and the Y806C mutation was inherited from her <lb/>father who showed no symptoms of tumor. On the <lb/>other hand, the V804M mutation was a de novo muta-<lb/>tion in the patient. Transforming activity of RET with <lb/>the V804M/Y806C double mutation was approximately <lb/>8 -13-fold higher than that of RET with a single <lb/>V804M or Y806C mutation [115]. Moreover, we found <lb/>that tyrosines 864 and 952 are also important for <lb/>transforming activity of RET with this double mutation <lb/>as observed for RET-M918T and RET-A883F mutant <lb/>proteins, suggesting that these three RET-MEN2B mu-<lb/>tant proteins have similar biological properties (Table <lb/>1) [115]. This was the first example to show that two <lb/>germline RET mutations in the same allele were respon-<lb/>sible for development of MEN 2B. <lb/>Cysteine mutations in the RET extracellular domain <lb/>sometimes induce the FMTC phenotype. Of these mu-<lb/>tations (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630 and 634), ap-<lb/>proximately 30% occurred at codon 634 and more than <lb/>60% occurred at codons 609, 618 and 620 in FMTC <lb/>families [126]. This is in contrast with the fact that <lb/>cysteine 634 mutations were detected in approximately <lb/>85% of the MEN 2A families. The transforming activity <lb/>of RET with codon 609, 618 or 620 mutation was <lb/>significantly low compared with that of RET with <lb/>codon 634 mutation (designated RET-Cys634) (Table <lb/>1), resulting from the impairment of cell surface expres-<lb/>sion of the former mutant proteins [121,127]. Their low <lb/>transforming activity may predispose to development of <lb/>FMTC rather than MEN 2A. Although three kinase <lb/>domain mutations at codons 768, 804 and 891 identified <lb/>in some FMTC families activate RET in a monomeric <lb/>form like the MEN2B mutations, the transforming <lb/>activity of these FMTC mutant proteins was also very <lb/>low compared with that of RET-Cys634 or RET-<lb/>MEN2B protein (Table 1) [123]. Taken together with <lb/>the fact that pheochromocytoma does not always de-<lb/>velop in the affected members of MEN 2A, low trans-<lb/>forming activity of the FMTC mutant proteins <lb/>supported the view that the threshold of transformation <lb/>is low in thyroid C cells and relatively high in adrenal <lb/>chromaffin cells. As observed for RET with cysteine <lb/>mutations, tyrosine 905 was required for transforming <lb/>activity of the RET-FMTC proteins with codon 768, <lb/>804 or 891 mutation (Table 1) [123], suggesting these <lb/>FMTC mutations may not alter the substrate specificity <lb/>of the RET protein. <lb/>In addition, we found that mutation of tyrosine 1062 <lb/>markedly decrease the transforming activity of all of <lb/>RET-MEN2A, RET-MEN2B and RET-FMTC mutant <lb/>proteins (Table 1) [93,115,123]. This finding is reason-<lb/>able because many signals including the RAS/ERK, <lb/>PI3K/AKT, JNK, p38MAPK and MEK5/BMK1 path-<lb/>ways are activated through tyrosine 1062 as mentioned <lb/>above (Fig. 2) [91,92,107]. Recently, Segouffin-Cariou <lb/>and Billaud [91] reported the importance of the PI3K/ <lb/>AKT signaling pathway for transforming activity of <lb/>RET-MEN2 proteins, although further investigation of <lb/>intracellular signaling pathways activated by mutant <lb/>RET will be required to deeply understand the molecu-<lb/>lar mechanisms of tumor development by RET <lb/>mutations. <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Characterization of RET with MEN2A, MEN2B or FMTC mutations <lb/>Mutations <lb/>Transforming activity <lb/>Disulfide-linked dimerization <lb/>Tyrosines required for transforming activity <lb/>Phenotype <lb/>High <lb/>Yes <lb/>C634X a <lb/>Y905, Y1062 <lb/>MEN 2A <lb/>FMTC <lb/>C609X <lb/>Low Intermediate <lb/>FMTC <lb/>C618X <lb/>Y905, Y1062 <lb/>Yes <lb/>C620X <lb/>MEN 2A <lb/>E768D <lb/>V804L <lb/>Low <lb/>No <lb/>Y905, Y1062 <lb/>FMTC <lb/>S891A <lb/>M918T <lb/>A883F <lb/>No <lb/>High <lb/>Y864, Y952, Y1062 <lb/>MEN 2B <lb/>V804M/ <lb/>Y806C <lb/>a X, any amino acids. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. Transgenic mouse models for MEN 2A and MEN2B <lb/>To date, several transgenic mouse models for MEN <lb/>2A or MEN 2B have been generated by introducing <lb/>mutant RET genes. Mice expressing a RET-MEN2A <lb/>gene under the control of the rat calcitonin gene-related <lb/>peptide/calcitonin (CGRP/CT) promoter or Moloney <lb/>murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR) have <lb/>been produced [128,129]. In case the CGRP/CT pro-<lb/>moter was used to specifically express the transgene in <lb/>thyroid C cells, animals of two transgenic mouse lines <lb/>displayed C cell hyperplasia and subsequently devel-<lb/>oped medullary thyroid carcinoma with a complete <lb/>penetrance at 14 months of age [128]. Despite the <lb/>transgene expression, no pathological change was ob-<lb/>served in the adrenal gland of transgenic mice. It was <lb/>suggested that this may be due to an insufficient level of <lb/>the RET-MEN2A mutant protein to exert an effect in <lb/>the adrenal gland. <lb/>We recently generated transgenic mice carrying the <lb/>RET-MEN2A gene under the control of MoMuLV <lb/>LTR [129]. They also developed C cell hyperplasia as <lb/>early as 4 weeks and developed medullary thyroid <lb/>carcinoma with a complete penetrance at 6 months of <lb/>age. Interestingly, although the mice expressed the <lb/>transgene and its protein product at high levels in <lb/>several tissues including brain, liver, and heart, no <lb/>pathological change was found in these tissues. RET <lb/>dimerization and its complex formation with Shc and <lb/>Grb2 adaptor proteins were detected in medullary car-<lb/>cinoma but not in brain, liver and heart of transgenic <lb/>mice. Our experimental results suggested the possibility <lb/>that high levels of expression of certain cell surface <lb/>proteins such as GFRa may interfere with dimerization <lb/>of the RET-MEN2A protein in brain, liver and heart, <lb/>leading to tissue-specific tumor development in trans-<lb/>genic mice. In this respect, it is interesting to note that <lb/>overexpression of Leukocyte Common Antigen-Related <lb/>(LAR) protein tyrosine phosphatase on the cell surface <lb/>also interfered with dimerization of the RET-MEN2A <lb/>protein and suppressed its oncogenic activity [130]. <lb/>Thus, it seems likely that expression of certain cell <lb/>surface proteins in the affected cells modifies the clinical <lb/>phenotypes of MEN 2 syndromes by impairing the <lb/>RET dimerization. <lb/>Transgenic mice expressing the RET-MEN2B gene <lb/>were produced using the human dopamine b-hydroxy-<lb/>lase (DbH) promoter or the human calcitonin gene <lb/>promoter [131-133]. The DbH promoter was expected <lb/>to efficiently function in the sympathetic and enteric <lb/>nervous systems as well as the adrenal gland. DbH-<lb/>RET-MEN2B transgenic mice developed benign neu-<lb/>roglial tumors, histologically identical to human <lb/>ganglioneuromatosis, in the sympathetic ganglia and <lb/>adrenal medullae, although malignant transformation <lb/>never occurred. On the other hand, the enteric nervous <lb/>system was not affected in these mice [131]. This resis-<lb/>tance may reflect, in part, a relatively low level of the <lb/>DbH promoter activity in enteric neurons. Unexpect-<lb/>edly, mice expressing high levels of the DbH-RET-<lb/>MEN2B gene displayed renal agenesis or dysgenesis as <lb/>observed in Ret-knockout mice. Gestblom et al. [132] <lb/>suggested that renal malformation could be secondary <lb/>to the expression of the RET-MEN2B transgene by <lb/>hyperplastic sympathoadrenal tissues that competes <lb/>with endogenous renal Ret for Gfra-1 or other signal-<lb/>ing components. <lb/>In case the human calcitonin gene promoter as a <lb/>regulatory unit was used for the expression of the <lb/>RET-MEN2B gene, one transgenic mouse line that <lb/>developed C cell hyperplasia at a high frequency was <lb/>established, although development of medullary thyroid <lb/>carcinoma was observed in only 13% of mice [133]. <lb/>Taken together with the fact that the CGRP/CT-RET-<lb/>MEN2A transgenic mice mentioned above had the vari-<lb/>able latency period for medullary carcinoma, this <lb/>finding supported the view that additional genetic alter-<lb/>ations are required for malignant transformation of <lb/>thyroid C cells. <lb/>More ideal transgenic mouse model for MEN 2B was <lb/>generated by introducing the mutation into mouse en-<lb/>dogenous Ret gene [134]. Gene targeting techniques in <lb/>conjunction with Cre/loxP site-specific recombination <lb/>were used to introduce the MEN2B (Met919Thr) muta-<lb/>tion into the corresponding exon of the mouse Ret <lb/>gene. Heterozygous mutant mice displayed hyperplasia <lb/>of thyroid C-cells and adrenal chromaffin cells, al-<lb/>though they were less severely affected than humans <lb/>with MEN 2B. Mutant homozygotes resembled the <lb/>human syndrome more closely, displaying an earlier <lb/>incidence and increased severity of C-cell hyperplasia <lb/>and chromaffin cell hyperplasia that progressed to <lb/>pheochromocytoma. However, these homozygotes did <lb/>not develop medullary thyroid carcinoma and gan-<lb/>glioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract and mu-<lb/>cosa that are characteristic of human MEN 2B, <lb/>suggesting that the accumulation of secondary genetic <lb/>alterations is also required for development of <lb/>medullary carcinoma in these mice. Moreover, neuro-<lb/>matous enlargement of sympathetic ganglia as well as a <lb/>male reproductive defect were observed in ho-<lb/>mozygotes. They exhibited normal mouting and pro-<lb/>duced mature sperm. Because erectile dysfunction with <lb/>a neuroloical basis is common in human with MEN 2B, <lb/>a likely explanation was that mutant mice also had a <lb/>erectile defect [134] <lb/>6.

			<body>Fig. 3. Mechanisms of RET dysfunction by HSCR mutations. Three <lb/>representative mechanisms of RET dysfunction by the designated <lb/>HSCR mutations are shown. In addition to these, we recently found <lb/>that several mutations (E762Q, S767R, R972G, M980T) identified in <lb/>the kinase domain severely impaired the PLCg signaling pathway in <lb/>a neuronal cell line [145]. <lb/>of the tyrosine kinase family [145]. Fourth, some muta-<lb/>tions (E762Q, S767R, R972G, M980T) that were also <lb/>identified in the kinase domain severely impaired the <lb/>activation of PLCg in SK-N-MC human neuronal cells, <lb/>whereas the RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways were <lb/>slightly affected [145]. Taken together, these results <lb/>suggested that several signaling pathways including <lb/>RAS/ERK. PI3K/AKT and PLCg pathways may coop-<lb/>eratively function for normal development of the en-<lb/>teric nervous system. <lb/>Recently, Bordeaux et al. [146] reported that the <lb/>expression of normal RET kinase can induce apotosis <lb/>and this pro-apoptotic effect is inhibited by GDNF. In <lb/>addition, It turned out that RET is a substrate for <lb/>caspase-3 and this caspase cleavage is required for its <lb/>pro-apoptotic effect. All of five HSCR mutations exam-<lb/>ined impaired GDNF-control of RET pro-apoptotic <lb/>activity [146], implying that HSCR may result from <lb/>apoptosis of RET-expressing enteric neuroblasts. <lb/>7. Cosegregation of MEN 2A/FMTC and HSCR <lb/>It has been reported that HSCR and MEN 2A/ <lb/>FMTC co-segregate in a sizeable fraction of families <lb/>and that affected members carry a single RET muta-<lb/>tions within the coding sequence [147,148]. Screening of <lb/>the RET gene in these families led to the identification <lb/>of point mutations at either cysteine 609, 618 or 620 <lb/>that segregated with both HSCR and MEN 2A/FMTC <lb/>phenotypes. These mutations were identical to previ-<lb/>ously described MEN2A/FMTC mutations and no ad-<lb/>ditional mutations were found after sequencing of the <lb/>entire RET coding region. We and others demonstrated <lb/>that these mutations markedly decreased the RET cell <lb/>surface expression like the HSCR mutations identified <lb/>formation associated with aganglionosis of the gas-<lb/>trointestinal tract. Based on the length of the agan-<lb/>glionic segment, it is classified into two groups: patients <lb/>with aganglionosis as far as the rectosigmoidal junction <lb/>(short segment type) and patients with aganglionosis <lb/>beyond the rectosigmoidal junction (long segment <lb/>type). RET mutations appeared to account for approxi-<lb/>mately 50% of familial and 10-20% of sporadic cases <lb/>of HSCR, most of which (approx. 75%) were associated <lb/>with long segment HSCR. A variety of missense, non-<lb/>sense and frameshift mutations have been identified <lb/>along the whole coding sequence of RET [25,26,135-<lb/>137]. <lb/>Based on functional analyses of RET with HSCR <lb/>mutations, it turned out that at least four mechanisms <lb/>of RET dysfunction are responsible for development of <lb/>HSCR. First, most mutations identified in the RET <lb/>extracellular domain markedly impaired the RET cell <lb/>surface expression, probably due to incorrect folding of <lb/>the RET protein (Fig. 3) [138-140]. As a result, the low <lb/>amount of the RET protein at the cell surface would <lb/>transmit a signal below the threshold required to elicit <lb/>a trophic response in enteric neuroblasts during em-<lb/>bryogenesis. It is interesting to note that long segment <lb/>HSCR mutations more severely impair the RET cell <lb/>surface expression than short segment HSCR mutation, <lb/>suggesting that the levels of the RET cell surface ex-<lb/>pression may correlate to the severity of HSCR [139]. <lb/>Second, a couple of mutations identified in the carboxy-<lb/>terminal tail impaired the SHC binding to RET (Fig. <lb/>3), thus resulting in RET-mediated signaling defect <lb/>[106,141]. As mentioned above, SHC binding is respon-<lb/>sible for at least two major signaling pathways includ-<lb/>ing RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways that may play <lb/>a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and survival <lb/>(Fig. 2). Third, several mutations in the kinase domain <lb/>almost completely abolished the RET tyrosine kinase <lb/>activity (Fig. 3) [142-145]. These mutations occurred at <lb/>amino acids that are highly conserved among members <lb/>Fig. 4. Dual effects of cysteine 609, 618 and 620 mutations on RET <lb/>function. <lb/></body>

			<body>in the RET extracellular domain, whereas they were <lb/>also able to induce the aberrant formation of disulfide-<lb/>linked RET homodimers at low levels, leading to con-<lb/>stitutive activation of the mutant RET proteins (Fig. 4) <lb/>[121,149,150]. Cysteine 609, 618 or 620 mutation might <lb/>alter the folding of RET, partially interfering with RET <lb/>maturation, intracellular trafficking or stable expression <lb/>at the plasma membrane. Although the level of RET <lb/>dimerization was low, the activity of these mutant RET <lb/>could be sufficient to trigger the development of <lb/>medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as pheochromocy-<lb/>toma. On the other hand, the decrease of RET cell <lb/>surface expression in enteric neuroblasts during em-<lb/>bryogenesis would transmit a signal below the <lb/>threshold necessary for their complete differentiation or <lb/>for prevention of their inappropriate apoptosis. Thus, it <lb/>seems likely that a single mutation at codon 609, 618 or <lb/>620 functions as either a gain-of-function mutation or a <lb/>loss-of-function mutation, depending on the cell types <lb/>expressed (Fig. 4) [150]. <lb/>8. Concluding remarks <lb/>In the past 10 years, studies on RET signaling have <lb/>provided us with many interesting findings on kidney <lb/>morphogenesis, neurogenesis and oncogenesis. In addi-<lb/>tion, it was recently reported that GDNF regulates <lb/>differentiation of spermatogonia, suggesting the possi-<lb/>bility that reduced spermatogonia pools in infertile men <lb/>might be restored by activating the RET signaling [151]. <lb/>However, despite these extensive studies of the signaling <lb/>pathways mediated by activated RET, we still do not <lb/>know precisely how each signaling component con-<lb/>tributes to these biological events. A deeper under-<lb/>standing of the signaling network will be necessary not <lb/>only elucidate to the molecular mechanisms of cell <lb/>growth, differentiation and survival but also to develop <lb/>therapeutic strategies for human diseases caused by <lb/>RET mutations. <lb/></body>
