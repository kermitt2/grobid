			<front>R E S E A R C H <lb/>Open Access <lb/>Mesenchymal stem cell-derived <lb/>extracellular vesicles attenuate influenza <lb/>virus-induced acute lung injury in a pig <lb/>model <lb/>Mahesh Khatri 1* , Levi Arthur Richardson 1 and Tea Meulia 2 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) mediate their immunoregulatory and tissue repair functions <lb/>by secreting paracrine factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs). In several animal models of human diseases, <lb/>MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs. Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness <lb/>resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Influenza viruses constantly evolve, thus generating drug-resistant <lb/>strains and rendering current vaccines less effective against the newly generated strains. Therefore, new therapies <lb/>that can control virus replication and the inflammatory response of the host are needed. The objective of this study <lb/>was to examine if MSC-EV treatment can attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a preclinical model. <lb/>Methods: We isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs. Morphology of MSC-EVs was determined by <lb/>electron microscopy and expression of mesenchymal markers was examined by flow cytometry. Next, we examined <lb/>the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs in vitro in lung epithelial cells and anti-viral and immunomodulatory <lb/>properties in vivo in a pig model of influenza virus. <lb/>Results: MSC-EVs were isolated from MSC-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation. MSC-EVs were round-shaped <lb/>and, similarly to MSCs, expressed mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of swine leukocyte antigens I and II. <lb/>Incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs with lung epithelial cells revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells. <lb/>Next, we examined the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs inhibited the <lb/>hemagglutination activity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses at concentrations of 1.25-5 μg/ml. <lb/>MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. The anti-<lb/>influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of <lb/>MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs. In a pig model of influenza virus, <lb/>intratracheal administration of MSC-EVs 12 h after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the <lb/>nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the <lb/>lungs of influenza-infected pigs. The histopathological findings revealed that MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced <lb/>lung lesions in pigs. <lb/>(Continued on next page) <lb/>* Correspondence: khatri.14@osu.edu <lb/>1 <lb/>Food Animal Health Research Program, Ohio Agricultural Research and <lb/>Development Center, The Ohio State University, 1680 Madison Avenue, <lb/>Wooster, OH 44691, USA <lb/>Full list of author information is available at the end of the article <lb/>© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 <lb/>International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and <lb/>reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to <lb/>the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

			<body>Background <lb/>Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause an acute respiratory <lb/>disease in humans and animals. Annual outbreaks and <lb/>occasional pandemics of influenza result in millions of <lb/>deaths, suffering, and economic losses. In the US alone, <lb/>since 2010 influenza viruses have caused 140,000-710,000 <lb/>hospitalizations resulting in 12,000-56,000 deaths annu-<lb/>ally (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/burden.htm). <lb/>The elderly, infants, and people with underlying condi-<lb/>tions are at high risk of influenza-associated mortality. In <lb/>addition to seasonal and pandemic viruses, highly patho-<lb/>genic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been repeat-<lb/>edly transmitted directly from avian species to humans. In <lb/>humans, H5N1 virus is associated with severe disease <lb/>resulting in multi-organ failure and high mortality rates <lb/>[1, 2]. As of 30 October 2017, HPAI H5N1 viruses have <lb/>caused 860 human infections resulting in 454 deaths since <lb/>2003 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_inter-<lb/>face/2017_10_30_tableH5N1.pdf?ua = 1) Severe cases of in-<lb/>fluenza cause significant mortality due to their ability to <lb/>induce cytokine-mediated immune lung pathology with fea-<lb/>tures of moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syn-<lb/>drome (ARDS) [3]. <lb/>Influenza virus infections are generally controlled by <lb/>annual vaccination. However, these vaccines provide <lb/>limited protection against new reassortants which are <lb/>genetically different from the vaccine virus. In the event <lb/>of a pandemic, generation of a new vaccine containing <lb/>circulating viruses takes approximately 6 months. More-<lb/>over, influenza viruses continually undergo mutations <lb/>resulting in the generation of new viral strains that can <lb/>become resistant to currently available antiviral drugs. <lb/>Thus, alternative therapies capable of inhibiting influ-<lb/>enza virus replication and attenuating the inflammatory <lb/>response of the host are needed. <lb/>Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) are mul-<lb/>tipotent cells that were first identified in bone mar-<lb/>row (BM) as plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells. <lb/>MSCs possess multilineage differentiation, and immu-<lb/>nomodulatory and tissue repair properties [4]. Due to <lb/>these properties MSCs are attractive as cellular ther-<lb/>apy for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and <lb/>regenerative medicine. Several studies of ARDS in <lb/>animal models have shown beneficial effects of MSC <lb/>administration, and clinical trials have shown the <lb/>feasibility of MSC administration in patients with <lb/>ARDS [5-7]. Therapeutic studies are underway. Simi-<lb/>larly to ARDS, severe influenza virus infections in <lb/>humans and animal models show acute inflammatory <lb/>response and lung damage [8]. As MSCs suppress <lb/>inflammation and have tissue repair and regenerative <lb/>ability, ARDS and influenza are appropriate targets <lb/>for MSC therapy. However, MSC therapy in mice <lb/>models of influenza show inconsistent results [9-12]. <lb/>Also, we and others have shown that influenza virus <lb/>infects MSCs and that infection may alter the <lb/>immunoregulatory and differentiation properties of <lb/>MSCs [13-15]. <lb/>Several studies indicated that the beneficial actions <lb/>of MSCs are due to release of paracrine factors since <lb/>only a few transplanted MSCs engraft at the site of <lb/>injury [16]. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) that <lb/>include exosomes (Exo) which are released from <lb/>multivesicular bodies and microvesicles (MVs) that <lb/>are shed from the cell surface, and apoptotic bodies <lb/>were identified in MSC secretions [17]. In this paper <lb/>EVs, Exo, and MVs will be collectively referred to as <lb/>EVs. MSC-derived EVs have similar expression of <lb/>surface molecules and contain MSC-specific proteins, <lb/>mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), organelles, and lipids <lb/>[18-20]. In diseased tissue, MSC-EVs interact with <lb/>injured cells and transfer proteins, mRNA, and bio-<lb/>active lipids from MSCs to injured cells resulting in <lb/>tissue repair [21, 22]. In rodent models, these EVs <lb/>were as therapeutically efficacious as MSCs in E. coli <lb/>endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and E. <lb/>coli-induced severe pneumonia in mice [20, 23]. <lb/>Due to their close similarity in anatomy, physiology, <lb/>and immunology to humans, pigs are used as a large <lb/>animal preclinical model for several human diseases, <lb/>including respiratory diseases and regenerative medi-<lb/>cine [24, 25]. In addition, pigs are naturally infected <lb/>with influenza virus as the respiratory epithelium of <lb/>pigs expresses receptors utilized by avian and mam-<lb/>malian influenza viruses [26]. Influenza virus patho-<lb/>genesis and clinical signs in pigs are also similar to <lb/>those observed in humans. Thus, pigs are a suitable <lb/>large animal model to study human influenza virus <lb/>pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of therapeutics <lb/>including MSCs or their derivatives for influenza. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Isolation of MSCs and MSC-derived EVs <lb/>MSCs from femur bones of 2-to 6-week-old commercial <lb/>pigs were isolated as described previously [27, 28]. <lb/>Briefly, the tip of each bone was removed and the <lb/>marrow was harvested by inserting a syringe needle into <lb/>one end of the bone and flushing with Dulbecco&apos;s <lb/>modified Eagle&apos;s medium (DMEM; Gibco). The BM cells <lb/>were filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh filter (BD, <lb/>Falcon, USA) and mononuclear cells were obtained by <lb/>density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. <lb/>Cells (1-5 × 10 5 /cm 2 ) were plated in 75-cm 2 cell culture <lb/>flasks in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum <lb/>(FBS; Gibco) and 1% antibiotic solution (Gibco) (C-<lb/>DMEM). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidi-<lb/>fied atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO 2 . The <lb/>nonadherent cells were removed after 72 h of culture <lb/>and cells were passaged when they were 90% confluent <lb/>by treating them with 0.25% trypsin containing 0.02% <lb/>EDTA. MSCs passaged between three and five times <lb/>were used for the generation of MSC-EVs for in vitro <lb/>and in vivo experiments. For the isolation of MSC-EVs, <lb/>MSCs were cultured in C-DMEM in T225 flasks and <lb/>MSC-EVs were isolated as previously described [23, 29, <lb/>30]. Briefly, cells when 80% confluent were washed with <lb/>serum-free DMEM and cultured in DMEM containing <lb/>0.5% bovine serum albumin. After 48 h, conditioned <lb/>medium (CM) from MSC cultures was collected and <lb/>centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to remove the cellu-<lb/>lar debris. Next, CM was ultracentrifuged at 25,000 rpm <lb/>for 70 min at 4 °C. The EV pellet was washed with <lb/>DMEM by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 70 min <lb/>at 4 °C. The EV pellet was then suspended in phosphate-<lb/>buffered saline (PBS; 10 μl PBS/million MSCs) and <lb/>further dilutions were made in serum-free DMEM. The <lb/>protein content of EVs was determined by micro-<lb/>bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermofisher Sci-<lb/>entific). MSC-EV RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy <lb/>kit (Qiagen) and RNA concentration was determined by <lb/>NanoDrop (Thermofisher Scientific). <lb/>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) <lb/>EVs (10 μl) were applied to a formvar/carbon-coated <lb/>grid for 5 min; after blotting, the grid was stained with <lb/>2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min. After blotting, the <lb/>grids were air-dried and examined under TEM (HITA-<lb/>CHI, H-7500, Japan). <lb/>Flow cytometry <lb/>MSCs and EVs were examined for surface expression of <lb/>mesenchymal markers and swine leukocyte antigen <lb/>(SLA)-I and SLA-II, and EVs were also examined for EV <lb/>markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81) by flow cytometry as <lb/>described previously [31]. EVs (30 μg in 50 μl PBS) were <lb/>incubated with 10 μl of 4-μm diameter aldehyde/sulfate <lb/>latex beads for 15 min at room temperature followed by <lb/>the addition of 1 ml PBS and incubation was further <lb/>continued for 2 h with gentle shaking. The reaction was <lb/>stopped by incubation for 30 min in 100 mM glycine. <lb/>MSCs were detached by treatment with 0.25% trypsin-<lb/>EDTA and single cell suspensions of MSC and EV-<lb/>coated beads were stained with the following primary <lb/>antibodies: mouse anti-pig CD29, mouse anti-human <lb/>CD90 (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-pig CD44 and SLA-<lb/>I and SLA-II (VMRD). For the detection of EV markers, <lb/>EV-coated beads were stained with the following <lb/>primary antibodies cross-reactive with pig: mouse anti-<lb/>human CD9 (GeneTex), mouse anti-human CD63 (BD <lb/>Biosciences), and mouse anti-human CD81 (BD Biosci-<lb/>ences) for 20 min at 4 °C in dark. Cells and beads were <lb/>washed three times and incubated with secondary <lb/>antibodies conjugated with allophycocyanin or phyco-<lb/>erythrin for 30 min. Appropriate isotype and secondary <lb/>antibodies were used as controls for nonspecific binding. <lb/>Cells and beads were acquired by C6 flow cytometer <lb/>(BD Accuri Cytometers) and analyzed using CFlow® plus <lb/>Software (Accuri) as described previously [32]. <lb/>Incorporation of EVs in pig lung epithelial cells <lb/>We examined whether MSC-EVs had the ability to enter <lb/>cells using pig lung epithelial cells (MK1-OSU; LECs). <lb/>MK1-OSU is a spontaneously immortalized cell line <lb/>established in our laboratory. This cell line was derived <lb/>from the distal trachea and proximal lung tissue of a 5-<lb/>to 6-week-old pig. These cells express α2-3-and α2-6-<lb/>linked sialic acids (receptors for avian and mammalian <lb/>influenza viruses, respectively), and support the replica-<lb/>tion of swine, avian, and human-origin influenza viruses <lb/>(unpublished results). MSC-EVs were labeled using <lb/>PKH-26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) <lb/>as per the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. LECs cultured <lb/>overnight in a 24-well plate were incubated with labeled <lb/>MSC-EVs for 24 h at 37 °C. To confirm the internaliza-<lb/>tion of EVs inside the cells, the cell cytoplasm was <lb/>stained using polyclonal rabbit anti-human β-tubulin as <lb/>the primary antibody (Thermofisher Scientific) and <lb/>Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary anti-<lb/>body (Thermofisher Scientific). Cell nuclei were stained <lb/>with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo-<lb/>fisher Scientific Life Sciences). The cells were examined <lb/>under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). For <lb/>flow cytometry, a single cell suspension was obtained by <lb/>treating the cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and washing <lb/>with PBS. Cells were acquired by C6 flow cytometer (BD <lb/>Accuri Cytometers) and incorporation of PKH-26 <lb/>labeled EVs in cells was analyzed by CFlow® plus Soft-<lb/>ware (Accuri). <lb/></body>

			<body>Hemagglutination inhibition assay <lb/>The effect of MSC-EVs on the ability of influenza virus <lb/>to hemagglutinate red blood cells was examined by <lb/>hemagglutination inhibition assay. Two-fold dilutions of <lb/>MSC-EVs (starting from 10 μg/ml) in 25 μl volume were <lb/>mixed with 8 hemagglutination (HA) units of swine <lb/>(swine/TX/98; H3N2 and Swine/MN/08; H1N1), avian <lb/>(Gull/MD/1995; H9N5 and Chicken/NY/H7N2), and <lb/>human (Human/CA/09; H1N1) influenza viruses and <lb/>incubated for 20 min at 37 °C followed by the addition <lb/>of 50 μl 1% turkey red blood cell suspension. Plates were <lb/>incubated for 30 min at room temperature and the <lb/>concentration of MSC-EVs capable of inhibiting HA <lb/>activity of different influenza viruses was determined. <lb/>Effect of MSC-EVs on influenza virus replication and apop-<lb/>tosis in LECs <lb/>To examine the effect of MSC-EVs on influenza virus <lb/>replication, two sets of experiments were conducted. <lb/>In the first set, we incubated swine/MN/08; H1N1 <lb/>(SwIV) equivalent to MOI 1 with 10 μg/ml MSC-EVs <lb/>for 20 min at room temperature. LECs cultured over-<lb/>night were then infected with SwIV alone or virus-<lb/>MSC-EV mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed <lb/>with PBS and were incubated with or without MSC-<lb/>EVs. After 8 h, influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) <lb/>was detected using anti-NP monoclonal antibody in <lb/>an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Cells expressing <lb/>NP protein were counted in at least five microscopic <lb/>fields and virus titers in culture supernatants were de-<lb/>termined by titration in MDCK cells [8]. At 24 h <lb/>after infection, apoptotic cells were detected by <lb/>TUNEL assay using ApopTag Fluorescein Apoptosis <lb/>Detection Kit (EMD Millipore). Apoptotic cells were <lb/>counted in five microscopic fields and data are <lb/>expressed as mean ± SD number of apoptotic cells/ <lb/>microscopic field. <lb/>In the second set of experiment, LECs were infected <lb/>with SwIV at an MOI 1 for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by <lb/>washing with PBS, and LECs were incubated with or <lb/>without MSC-EVs for 8 h. Influenza-infected cells <lb/>were detected by the expression of NP by IFA. In <lb/>some experiments, MSC-EVs were treated with 1 U/ <lb/>ml RNase for 1 h at 37 °C, 1 U/ml RNase was then <lb/>added to stop the reaction and MSC-EVs were <lb/>washed by ultracentrifugation [29]. <lb/>Immunofluorescence assay <lb/>LECs were washed with PBS and fixed with 80% <lb/>acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. The expression of <lb/>influenza virus NP in infected cells was detected <lb/>using mouse anti-NP antibody as a primary antibody <lb/>and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as a <lb/>secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI <lb/>(Thermofisher Scientific Life Sciences). <lb/>Animals <lb/>Five-week-old conventional large White-Duroc cross-<lb/>bred pigs were obtained from the OSU herd. Mainten-<lb/>ance of pigs and all experimental procedures were <lb/>conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Insti-<lb/>tutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee, <lb/>The Ohio State University (protocol #2014A00000040). <lb/>Experimental design and sample collection <lb/>At 8 weeks of age, nine pigs (mean weight 12.1 ± 1.3 kg) <lb/>were divided into three groups of three pigs each. Pigs in <lb/>group 1 were inoculated intranasally with DMEM and <lb/>these pigs served as controls. Pigs in groups 2 and 3 <lb/>were similarly inoculated with SwIV (5 × 10 6 TCID 50 per <lb/>pig). Pigs had a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) anti-<lb/>body titer of 1:12 ± 4 against SwIV before infection. In <lb/>our previous study, infection of 8-week-old commercial <lb/>pigs with SwIV (5 × 10 6 TCID 50 per pig) induced exten-<lb/>sive lung lesions [33]. Twelve hours after SwIV infection, <lb/>pigs in groups 2 and 3 were administered intratracheally <lb/>with DMEM and MSC-EVs (80 μg/kg body weight <lb/>(BW)), respectively. In human clinical trials for ARDS <lb/>[6], MSCs between 1 and 10 × 10 6 cells/kg BW were <lb/>used. In our study, EV dose per kg BW was calculated <lb/>by the protein content of EVs produced by 10 × 10 6 <lb/>MSCs cultured for 48 h. In a previous study [23] intra-<lb/>tracheally administered EVs were effective in treating E. <lb/>coli-induced severe pneumonia. Based on this observa-<lb/>tion, in this study EVs were administered by the intratra-<lb/>cheal route. Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs <lb/>and nasal swabs were collected at 1 and 3 days post-<lb/>infection (DPI) for virus titration in MDCK cells. At DPI <lb/>3, pigs were euthanized and lungs were harvested. Lung <lb/>lysate was prepared from the left lung for virus quantifi-<lb/>cation and cytokine analysis, and the entire right lung <lb/>was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for microscopic <lb/>examination. The time-point DPI 3 was selected based <lb/>on our earlier publication showing higher virus replica-<lb/>tion and proinflammatory cytokine production at DPI 3 <lb/>compared with DPI 6 [8]. Paraffin-embedded sections of <lb/>lung tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin <lb/>and examined with the help of a trained pathologist who <lb/>was not aware of the experimental design. The slides <lb/>were examined for bronchiolar epithelial changes, peri-<lb/>bronchiolar inflammation, and interstitial pneumonia, <lb/>and lesions were scored from 0-3 as described previ-<lb/>ously [34, 35]. <lb/>Detection of SwIV in nasal swabs and lungs <lb/>A 10% (w/v) lung homogenate was prepared from left <lb/>apical lobe lung tissue and virus titer was determined by <lb/></body>

			<body>titration in MDCK cells as described [33]. Virus titers <lb/>were calculated by the Reed and Muench method. <lb/>Detection of cytokines in lungs <lb/>Lung lysates from pigs were prepared and levels of <lb/>tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, CXCL10, and interleu-<lb/>kin (IL)-10 in lung lysates were determined by <lb/>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as de-<lb/>scribed previously [8]. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>In vitro data on MSC-EV-mediated inhibition of SwIV <lb/>replication were analyzed by Student&apos;s t test. Micro-<lb/>scopic lung lesions, virus titers, and cytokine concentra-<lb/>tions between groups of pigs were compared using <lb/>Kruskal-Wallis test. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered <lb/>statistically significant. <lb/>Results <lb/>Characteristics of MSC-derived EVs <lb/>We isolated MSCs from the BM of 2-to 6-week-old pigs <lb/>that showed characteristic features of MSCs, such as <lb/>adherence to a plastic surface, fibroblast-like morph-<lb/>ology (Fig. 1), self-renewal potential, and high in vitro <lb/>proliferation capacity and differentiation potential (data <lb/>not shown). Colony-expanded MSCs showed the expres-<lb/>sion of the mesenchymal markers CD29, CD44, CD90, <lb/>and SLA-I, but SLA-II was not detected on these cells. <lb/>MSC-EVs were round-shaped and, similarly to MSCs, <lb/>EVs isolated from BM-MSCs also expressed mesenchy-<lb/>mal markers; however, unlike MSCs, they lacked the <lb/>expression of both SLA-I and II (Fig. 1). MSC-EVs also <lb/>expressed EV-specific markers such as CD9, CD63, and <lb/>CD81 (Fig. 2). We also determined the RNA and protein <lb/>concentration in MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs contained 113 ± <lb/>37 ng/100 μl EVs (n = 5) total RNA and 79 ± 1 μg/100 μl <lb/>EVs (n = 4) total protein. <lb/>Additionally, MSC-EVs showed the ability to incorpor-<lb/>ate into LECs. EVs stained red with PKH-26 dye were <lb/>found inside the cytoplasm of cells when examined <lb/>under a fluorescent microscope. Incorporation of MSC-<lb/>EVs in LECs was also confirmed by flow cytometry <lb/>(Fig. 3). <lb/>MSC-EVs inhibit the HA activity of influenza viruses <lb/>To determine if MSC-EVs possess anti-influenza activity, <lb/>we first examined if EVs inhibited the HA activity of in-<lb/>fluenza viruses. Eight HA units of swine/TX/98; H3N2, <lb/>swine/MN/08; H1N1, gull/MD/1995; H9N5, chicken/ <lb/>NY/H7N2, and human/CA/09; H1N1 influenza viruses <lb/>were incubated with different concentrations of MSC-<lb/>EVs and the HA activity of these viruses was examined. <lb/>MSC-EV concentrations between 1.25 and 5 μg/ml com-<lb/>pletely inhibited the HA activity of these viruses <lb/>(Table 1). <lb/>MSC-EVs inhibit SwIV replication and virus-induced apop-<lb/>tosis in LECs <lb/>We examined MSC-EVs derived from BM-MSCs for <lb/>anti-influenza activity. SwIV (Sw/MN/08; MOI of 1) was <lb/>incubated with MSC-EVs (10 μg/ml) for 20 min at room <lb/>temperature. LECs were infected with EV-SwIV mixture <lb/>or virus only. At 8 h after infection, IAV-NP was <lb/>detected by IFA (Fig. 4a and c). Significantly reduced (P <lb/>&lt; 0.05) influenza replication was detected when cells <lb/>were infected with SwIV pretreated with MSC-EVs. <lb/>Consistent with reduced influenza virus replication in <lb/>LECs treated with MSC-EVs, MSC-EVs also significantly <lb/>(P &lt; 0.05) inhibited the apoptosis of influenza-infected <lb/>LEC (Fig. 5a and b). <lb/>Fig. 1 Characteristics of MSC-derived EVs. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from the conditioned medium of porcine bone marrow-derived <lb/>mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) by ultracentrifugation. Morphology and size of MSC-EVs was examined by TEM. EVs were round-shaped and <lb/>approximately 100 nm in size (×25 K). Expression of mesenchymal markers on MSCs and MSC-EVs was examined by flow cytometry. MSCs expressed <lb/>the mesenchymal markers CD29, CD44, and CD90, and swine leukocyte antigen (SLA)-I, but SLA-II was not expressed. Similarly to MSCs, EVs expressed <lb/>the mesenchymal markers but lacked the expression of SLA-I and SLA-II (black line: isotype staining; red line: specific staining) <lb/></body>

			<body>In another set of experiments, porcine lung epithelial <lb/>LECs were infected with SwIV for 1 h, washed, and incu-<lb/>bated with media without or with MSC-EVs (10 μg/ml). <lb/>At 8 h after infection, IAV-NP was detected by IFA. The <lb/>addition of MSC-EVs after virus entry significantly (P &lt; <lb/>0.05) reduced influenza replication in LECs (Fig. 6). <lb/>MSC-EVs attenuate SwIV-induced ALI in pigs <lb/>We examined the anti-influenza and immunomodula-<lb/>tory effect of MSC-EVs in influenza virus-induced ALI <lb/>in pigs. Eight-week-old pigs were infected intranasally <lb/>with 5 × 10 6 TCID 50 of SwIV. Twelve hours after SwIV <lb/>inoculation, DMEM or MSC-EVs (80 μg/kg) were <lb/>administered intratracheally in influenza-infected pigs. <lb/>At days 1 and 3 after EV administration, we collected <lb/>the nasal swabs, and at day 3 after EV administration the <lb/>pigs were euthanized and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) <lb/>and lungs were collected. Lungs were homogenized to <lb/>make 10% lung lysate for determining virus titers, and <lb/>cytokines were examined in the lung lysate. <lb/>SwIV induced extensive lung lesions in infected pigs <lb/>as determined by infiltration of inflammatory cells, <lb/>thickened alveolar walls, and collapsed alveoli, whereas <lb/>lungs of pigs administered with MSC-EVs showed <lb/>minor infiltration of inflammatory cells. The mean <lb/>microscopic lung lesion score in SwIV + DMEM inocu-<lb/>lated pigs was 7.3 ± 1.5 compared with 2.6 ± 1.5 in the <lb/>SwIV + EV administered group (Fig. 7a-d). Consistent <lb/>Fig. 2 Mesenchymal stem cell extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) express EV markers. EV-coated latex beads were examined for the expression of EV <lb/>markers by flow cytometry.

Virus <lb/>shedding was 100-fold lower in the EV-administered <lb/>group at 3 days post-EV administration as compared <lb/>with SwIV + DMEM inoculated pigs (Fig. 8).

			<body>Discussion <lb/>In this study, we isolated porcine BM-MSC-derived EVs <lb/>and examined their anti-viral and immunomodulatory <lb/>properties in a pig model of influenza virus. MSC-EVs <lb/>were round-shaped and, similarly to BM-MSCs, <lb/>expressed mesenchymal markers but, unlike MSC, EVs <lb/>lacked the expression of both SLA-I and II whereas <lb/>MSCs expressed SLA-I. Importantly, MSC-EVs inhibited <lb/>the HA activity of influenza viruses, suppressed the <lb/>replication of influenza virus in lung epithelial cells, and <lb/>inhibited influenza virus replication and proinflamma-<lb/>tory cytokine production in the lungs of virus-<lb/>infected pigs. <lb/>We isolated and characterized EVs from porcine BM-<lb/>MSCs using protocols as described for human MSC-<lb/>derived EVs [23, 29, 30]. As for human MSC-EVs, we <lb/>also used TEM to determine the size and morphology of <lb/>MSC-EVs. Size distribution of human MSC-EVs was also <lb/>determined by nanotracking but this technique was not <lb/>used in this study. Human MSC-derived EVs expressed <lb/>mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of <lb/>MHC molecules [36]. In our study, pig MSC-derived <lb/>EVs also expressed mesenchymal markers and the <lb/>expression of both SLA-I and II was not detected in <lb/>EVs, suggesting that pig MSC-EVs are similar to human <lb/>MSC-EVs and will be useful in understanding the mech-<lb/>anisms of MSC-EV-mediated therapeutic effects in a pig <lb/>model of human diseases. <lb/>A number of studies have demonstrated the beneficial <lb/>effects of MSC-EVs in vitro and in animal models of <lb/>lung, kidney, and liver diseases [37, 38]. Furthermore, <lb/>several studies have shown that EVs exert their thera-<lb/>peutic effects by transferring their mRNA to diseased <lb/>cells [20, 29, 39, 40]. In this study, the anti-influenza <lb/>virus activity of MSC-EVs in lung epithelial cells was <lb/>mediated by their mRNA content as pretreatment of <lb/>EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza <lb/>virus activity of EVs. In a recent study, Qian and <lb/>colleagues [41] demonstrated that exosomes (Exo) <lb/>isolated from umbilical cord-derived MSCs inhibited <lb/>replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in human dermal <lb/>fibroblast 7 cells. These authors further identified four <lb/>MSC-Exo-specific miRNAs with anti-HCV activity. <lb/>MSC-EV-specific miRNAs have also been implicated in <lb/>the regulation of cell survival, differentiation, and immu-<lb/>nomodulation [42, 43]. Future studies will focus on <lb/>identifying MSC-EV-specific mRNA and miRNAs that <lb/>may play a role in regulating the anti-influenza activities <lb/>of MSC-EVs. <lb/>One of the mechanisms by which influenza viruses <lb/>cause extensive lung damage and mortality is due to the <lb/>induction of unregulated inflammatory response [44, <lb/>45]. Similarly to MSCs, MSC-derived EVs also possess <lb/>immunomodulatory activity [46-52]. In this study, <lb/>MSC-EV inoculated pigs showed significantly less lung <lb/>inflammation and decreased levels of proinflammatory <lb/>cytokine and chemokine production. Additionally, <lb/>increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 <lb/>were observed in MSC-EV administered pigs. These data <lb/>suggest that, in addition to anti-influenza activity, MSC-<lb/>EVs also exert their immunomodulatory activities and <lb/>suppress the inflammatory response in influenza. Similar <lb/>to our findings, MSC-EVs caused decreased production <lb/>of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of <lb/>IL-10 in a mouse model of ARDS [20]. Monsel and <lb/>colleagues [23] demonstrated that MSC-EVs express <lb/>cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA, the enzyme that in-<lb/>duces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. PGE2 secreted <lb/>by MSCs has been shown to reprogram proinflammatory <lb/>monocyte-macrophages (M1) to the anti-inflammatory <lb/>(M2) type that produces high levels of IL-10 [53]. Add-<lb/>itionally, MSC-EVs interact with immune cells and cause <lb/>the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)β <lb/>Fig. 5 MSC-EVs inhibit influenza virus-induced apoptosis. a Swine/ <lb/>MN/08; H1N1 (SwIV; MOI = 1) was incubated with Dulbecco&apos;s modi-<lb/>fied Eagle&apos;s medium (DMEM) or 10 μg/ml MSC extracellular vesicles <lb/>(EVs) for 20 min at room temperature. After the incubation, pig lung <lb/>epithelial cells were incubated for 1 h with SwIV or SwIV pre-<lb/>incubated with MSC-EVs. At 24 h after infection, apoptotic cells were <lb/>detected by TUNEL assay using the ApopTag Fluorescein Apoptosis <lb/>Detection Kit (EMD Millipore). b TUNEL-positive cells in SwIV-infected <lb/>and MSC-EV-treated LECs were counted at 24 h after infection. <lb/>Values are expressed as mean ± SD of apoptotic cells in five <lb/>microscopic fields (20×). *P &lt; 0.05 <lb/></body>

			<body>and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) [48]. Tregs promote virus <lb/>clearance and recovery in influenza virus-infected <lb/>mice [54, 55]. In future studies, we will examine <lb/>whether MSC-EV treatment induces the generation of <lb/>M2-type macrophages and Tregs in a pig model of <lb/>influenza virus. <lb/>MSCs mediate their immunomodulatory and tissue <lb/>repair functions by the release of numerous therapeutic <lb/>soluble factors [43, 56]. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase <lb/>(IDO) is produced by MSCs and modulates the func-<lb/>tions of immune cells and inhibits influenza virus repli-<lb/>cation [57]. Similarly, LL37, an antimicrobial peptide, is <lb/>produced by MSCs and has been shown to inhibit the <lb/>growth of several species of bacteria and also inhibits <lb/>replication of influenza virus [58, 59]. Additionally, <lb/>LL37 was also shown to regulate the immunomodula-<lb/>tory activities of MSCs [60]. Currently, data on <lb/>whether LL37 and IDO are transferred from MSCs to <lb/>their secreted EVs are not available and were not <lb/>examined in this study. It may be possible that these <lb/>factors may be involved in mediating the anti-<lb/>influenza and anti-inflammatory activities of MSC-EVs <lb/>in our influenza model. <lb/>Recently, a few studies examined the therapeutic <lb/>potential of MSCs in influenza in mice with conflict-<lb/>ing results [9-12]. The Liles and Matthay groups <lb/>reported that mouse and human MSCs failed to pre-<lb/>vent influenza virus-induced mortality and ALI in <lb/>mice [10, 11]. More recently, two publications have <lb/>shown that MSCs reduced influenza virus-induced <lb/>ALI in mice infected with HPAI H5N1 and H9N2 <lb/>without affecting the virus replication [9, 12]. We and <lb/>others have shown previously that influenza virus <lb/>infected MSCs and that infected MSCs produced <lb/>inflammatory cytokines [13-15]. Of the in vivo <lb/>studies that examined the therapeutic efficacy of <lb/>MSCs in influenza virus-induced ALI, none examined <lb/>the infection of administered MSCs with influenza <lb/>virus. Replicating virus in influenza virus-infected <lb/>mice may infect the injected MSCs and virus-infected <lb/>MSCs may not be functionally effective in inhibiting <lb/>virus replication and inflammation. In in-vitro studies, <lb/>influenza virus infection caused the apoptosis and <lb/>lysis of infected MSCs [13]. Inactivated MSCs have <lb/>been shown to retain some of their immunomodula-<lb/>tory functions. Heat-inactivated MSCs modulated the <lb/>functions of monocytes/macrophages but had no <lb/>effect on T or B cells [61]. In studies which demon-<lb/>strated the protective effects of transplanted MSCs in <lb/>influenza virus-infected mice, anti-inflammatory <lb/>Fig. 8 Effect of MSC-EV administration on virus titers in nasal swabs <lb/>and lungs of pigs infected with SwIV.

Nasal swabs were <lb/>collected from infected pigs at 1 and 3 days after EV administration <lb/>(1DPEV and 3DPEV). At 3 days after EV administration, pigs were <lb/>euthanized and lungs were harvested. Lung tissues were homogenized <lb/>to prepare 10% lung lysate.

			<body>effects observed in these studies may likely be medi-<lb/>ated by influenza-infected dead or apoptotic MSCs. <lb/>Future experiments will be required to confirm the <lb/>infection of transplanted MSC by influenza virus and <lb/>to examine their interaction with immune cells in <lb/>animal models of influenza virus. <lb/>MSC-EVs were recently identified and were as <lb/>equally effective as MSCs in treating endotoxin and E <lb/>coli-induced ALI in rodent models [20, 23]. Here, we <lb/>demonstrated that MSC-EVs attenuated influenza <lb/>virus-induced ALI in a pig model. Importantly, <lb/>administration of MSC-EVs was safe since no gross <lb/>pathological lesions were observed in any of the <lb/>internal organs of the pigs. Additionally, MSC-EV <lb/>treatment was also found to be safe in human <lb/>patients treated for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) <lb/>and chronic kidney disease [50, 62]. Thus, the find-<lb/>ings of this study may help in the planning of future <lb/>clinical trials in humans using MSC-EVs as a cell-free <lb/>therapy for ARDS. <lb/>MSC-EVs offer several advantages over MSCs as a <lb/>therapy for human diseases. Although MSCs have <lb/>been proven to be effective and safe in treating sev-<lb/>eral human conditions in animal models and clinical <lb/>trials, safety concerns such as pulmonary embolism, <lb/>uncontrolled differentiation, and tumor formation are <lb/>still associated with the use of MSCs as a therapy in <lb/>humans [63, 64]. On the other hand, use of EVs as a <lb/>therapy was found to be safer than MSCs [20, 50]. <lb/>EVs are stable in circulation due to their lipid mem-<lb/>brane, have no risk of aneuploidy, and are well toler-<lb/>ated in recipients due to their small size and lack of <lb/>expression of MHC molecules. Moreover, EVs can be <lb/>stored at -80 °C without losing their biochemical <lb/>activity [65, 66]. Thus, EVs have the potential to <lb/>become a safe and effective cell-free therapy for <lb/>human diseases. However, a number of challenges, <lb/>such as standard protocols for the production of clin-<lb/>ical grade EVs, their dosing, quality control, and stor-<lb/>age conditions, still need to be addressed before <lb/>MSC-EVs can be advanced to the clinic. <lb/>This study has certain limitations: 1) an additional <lb/>control group consisting of EVs derived from fibroblasts <lb/>is needed to confirm that the beneficial effects in influ-<lb/>enza are specifically mediated by MSC-EV; and 2) <lb/>administration of EVs by the intravenous route would be <lb/>more relevant in the clinical settings. However, in several <lb/>studies, EVs obtained from MSCs, but not from fibro-<lb/>blasts, showed beneficial effects in ARDS when inocu-<lb/>lated intravenously or intratracheally. In our preliminary <lb/>studies in a pig model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-in-<lb/>duced ARDS, only human MSC-derived EVs, and not <lb/>EVs from normal human lung fibroblasts, attenuated <lb/>lung inflammation. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>In summary, EVs derived from porcine BM-MSCs <lb/>expressed mesenchymal markers, inhibited influenza <lb/>virus replication in vitro and in vivo, and attenuated <lb/>influenza virus-induced ALI in a relevant preclinical <lb/>large animal model. Our findings suggest that MSC-<lb/>EVs may be a potential cell-free therapy for acute <lb/>inflammatory diseases including influenza. <lb/></body>
