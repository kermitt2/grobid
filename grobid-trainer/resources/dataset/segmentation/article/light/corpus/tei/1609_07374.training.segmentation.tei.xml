			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Parton distribution functions (PDFs) play a very important role <lb/>in the theoretical description of high energy reactions. Recent <lb/>decades were marked by enormous progress in both theoretical <lb/>and experimental studies of spin-(in)dependent and transverse-<lb/>momentum-dependent (TMD) nucleon PDFs. The latter provide a <lb/>three-dimensional picture of a fast moving nucleon in momen-<lb/>tum space, for recent reviews see Refs. [1-5]. The TMD factori-<lb/>sation was proven to hold [6] for the cross sections of semi-<lb/>inclusive measurements of hadron production in deep-inelastic <lb/>lepton-nucleon scattering, N → h X (hereafter referred to as <lb/>SIDIS) and of lepton-pair production in the Drell-Yan process, <lb/>h N → ¯ X (hereafter referred to as DY). This allows comparative <lb/>studies of the same nucleon TMD PDFs and their dependence on <lb/>the hard scale Q via TMD evolution. Here, Q 2 is the photon virtu-<lb/>ality in SIDIS and Q = Q 2 is the di-muon mass in DY. <lb/>The spin and quark-transverse-momentum structure of the nu-<lb/>cleon is described by TMD PDFs. Among them, an important role is <lb/>played by the &quot;twist-2&quot; Sivers function f ⊥ <lb/>1T [7] that describes the <lb/>left-right asymmetry in the distribution of partons in the nucleon <lb/>with respect to the plane spanned by the directions of momentum <lb/>and spin of the nucleon. A peculiar feature of the Sivers TMD PDF <lb/>predicted in Refs. [8-10] is that it contributes with opposite sign <lb/>to SIDIS and DY, which is considered to be an essential prediction <lb/>of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Since the contribution of the <lb/>Sivers TMD PDF as a &quot;twist-2&quot; object is not suppressed at high <lb/>Q 2 , measurements of the Sivers effect at largely different hard <lb/>scales can be directly compared. This opens the possibility to con-<lb/>clude which of the existing Q 2 -evolution schemes describes the <lb/>data best. <lb/>The Sivers effect was studied in SIDIS using transversely po-<lb/>larised targets at HERMES [11], COMPASS [12-14] and JLab Hall A <lb/>[15] and nonzero results were obtained. The typical hard scale of <lb/>these fixed-target measurements, Q ≈ (1-5) GeV/c, is quite dif-<lb/>ferent from the one explored in Drell-Yan measurements of the <lb/>Sivers effect using pp-collisions at RHIC [16] with Q ≈ 80 GeV/c <lb/>and 90 GeV/c. <lb/>The COMPASS experiment at CERN [17,18] is presently the only <lb/>place to explore the transverse spin structure of the nucleon by <lb/>either SIDIS or DY measurements, using a similar set-up and a <lb/>similar transversely polarised proton target. This opens the unique <lb/>opportunity, when comparing the Sivers TMD PDFs obtained from <lb/>the two alternative experimental approaches, to test the opposite-<lb/>sign prediction by QCD at practically the same hard scale, thereby <lb/>minimising possible bias introduced by TMD evolution. <lb/>In 2010, SIDIS hadron data were taken at COMPASS using a lon-<lb/>gitudinally polarised muon beam of 160 GeV/c momentum and a <lb/>transversely polarised NH 3 proton target. In 2015, DY data were <lb/>taken using a high-intensity π − beam of 190 GeV/c and a similar <lb/>transversely polarised target. <lb/>In order to provide useful input for future global analyses that <lb/>will compare TMD PDFs obtained from SIDIS data with those <lb/>obtained from DY data, COMPASS extracted all transverse-spin-<lb/>dependent azimuthal asymmetries in the SIDIS cross section (here-<lb/></body>

			<body>after referred to as TSAs), using the same four Q 2 -ranges as those <lb/>selected for the analysis of the DY data: <lb/>i) 1 GeV/c &lt; Q &lt; 2 GeV/c: &quot;low mass&quot; range, where many back-<lb/>ground processes contribute; <lb/>ii) 2 GeV/c &lt; Q &lt; 2.5 GeV/c: &quot;intermediate mass&quot; range; <lb/>iii) 2.5 GeV/c &lt; Q &lt; 4 GeV/c: &quot;J/ψ mass range&quot;; <lb/>iv) 4 GeV/c &lt; Q &lt; 9 GeV/c: &quot;high mass&quot; range where background <lb/>processes are strongly suppressed. <lb/>Range iv) is particularly suited to study the predicted sign <lb/>change of the Sivers TMD PDF when comparing SIDIS and DY <lb/>results. First, this range best fulfils the requirement of TMD fac-<lb/>torisation that the transverse momentum of the hadron in SIDIS <lb/>or of the muon pair in DY has to be much smaller than Q . Sec-<lb/>ondly, both SIDIS and DY cross sections for a proton target are <lb/>dominated by the contribution of u-quark nucleon TMD PDFs in <lb/>the valence region, where the extracted Sivers TMD PDF reaches <lb/>its maximum [19,20]. <lb/>In this Letter, the main focus will be on the Sivers effect. The <lb/>present experimental and theoretical understanding of TMD PDFs <lb/>and TSAs is briefly summarised in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, data selection <lb/>and analysis are described. In Sec. 4, results on the Sivers TSAs <lb/>are given for the first time in various two-dimensional kinematic <lb/>representations. Conclusions are presented in Sec. 5. <lb/>2. TMD PDFs and TSAs <lb/>The general expression for the cross section of unpolarised-<lb/>hadron production in polarised-lepton SIDIS off a transversely <lb/>polarised nucleon comprises eight target-transverse-polarisation-<lb/>dependent modulations in the azimuthal angle φ h of the produced <lb/>hadron and/or the azimuthal angle φ S of the target spin vector [21, <lb/>22]. These angles are defined in the target rest frame with the <lb/>ẑ axis along the virtual-photon momentum and the x axis along <lb/>the lepton transverse momentum, where transverse is meant with <lb/>respect to the ẑ axis. Five of these eight modulations are indepen-<lb/>dent of the lepton polarisation. <lb/>Similarly, the cross section of pion-nucleon DY lepton-pair <lb/>production off a transversely polarised nucleon also comprises <lb/>five target-transverse-polarisation-dependent azimuthal modula-<lb/>tions, when the polarisations of the produced leptons are summed <lb/>over [23,18]. <lb/>The quark Sivers functions have been extracted from HER-<lb/>MES [11] and COMPASS [12-14] data using both collinear [19,20] <lb/>and TMD Q 2 -evolution approaches [24-27]. In the commonly ac-<lb/>cessible range of the Bjorken-x variable, the Sivers TSA at HERMES <lb/>was found to be somewhat larger compared to that measured at <lb/>COMPASS. Taking into account that in this range the hard scale at <lb/>COMPASS is as much as two to three times larger compared to that <lb/>of HERMES, this observation may indicate the influence of TMD <lb/>evolution effects. In order to test this conjecture, measuring TSAs <lb/>at COMPASS in various Q 2 regions may yield very useful input for <lb/>testing the effect of TMD evolution. <lb/>In DY lepton-pair production with a transversely polarised nu-<lb/>cleon in the initial state, a sin( S ) asymmetry is generated by the <lb/>Sivers effect. Here, S is the azimuthal angle of the nucleon po-<lb/>larisation in the target rest frame with the ẑ axis along the beam <lb/>momentum and the x axis along the direction of the transverse <lb/>momentum of the produced di-muon. <lb/>Among the five lepton-polarisation-independent TSAs that ap-<lb/>pear in SIDIS and DY, three are induced by the &quot;twist-2&quot; Sivers <lb/>( f ⊥ <lb/>1T ), transversity (h 1 ), pretzelosity (h ⊥ <lb/>1T ) TMD PDFs, while the <lb/>other two are related to various &quot;twist-3&quot; objects [22,23]. Simi-<lb/>larly, three SIDIS lepton-polarisation-dependent TSAs give access <lb/></body>

Right panel: same distribution shown separately for each (Q 2 , x) cell. <lb/>to &quot;twist-2&quot; g 1T and different &quot;twist-3&quot; TMDs. In contrast to the <lb/>Sivers function, transversity, pretzelosity and g 1T TMD PDFs are <lb/>predicted to be genuinely universal, i.e. their contributions do not <lb/>change sign between SIDIS and DY [6]. <lb/>Recently, the first measurement of TSAs in the cross section of <lb/>W and Z production using single-transversely polarised proton-<lb/>proton collisions at RHIC was reported by the STAR collabora-<lb/>tion [16]. Comparing the data with predictions from Ref. [28] they <lb/>conclude that the measured Sivers asymmetry appears to be bet-<lb/>ter compatible with the sign-change scenario for the Sivers TMD <lb/>PDF than with the one without sign change. Note that these pre-<lb/>dictions do not include TMD evolution effects and are based on <lb/>parametrisations of Sivers and unpolarised TMD PDFs that were fit-<lb/>ted to asymmetries measured at fixed-target energies [20]. Because <lb/>of the largely different typical hard scales accessed by fixed-target <lb/>and collider experiments, it is not excluded that TMD evolution ef-<lb/>fects play a substantial role when comparing W and Z production <lb/>to fixed target results. For completeness we note that together with <lb/>the parametrisations of TMD PDFs at initial scale, the TMD evolu-<lb/>tion approach needs additional non-perturbative input information <lb/>that cannot be calculated in pQCD. For various possible choices of <lb/>this input information, different predictions exist [25-27]. <lb/>Altogether, measuring the Sivers effect at COMPASS both in <lb/>SIDIS and DY at a comparable hard scale will provide the most <lb/>direct way to check the pQCD prediction for a sign change of the <lb/>Sivers TMD PDF. <lb/>3. Data analysis <lb/>The analysis presented in this Letter is performed using COM-<lb/>PASS SIDIS data collected in 2010 using a 160 GeV/c longitudinally <lb/>polarised muon beam from the CERN SPS and a transversely po-<lb/>larised NH 3 target with proton polarisation P T ≈ 0.8 and dilution <lb/>factor f ≈ 0.15, where the latter describes the fraction of po-<lb/>larisable nucleons in the target. These data were already used for <lb/>the extraction of the Sivers and other TSAs, see Refs. [13,14,29, <lb/>30], where also details on the experimental apparatus are given. In <lb/>the analysis presented here, the TSAs are extracted for the first <lb/>time using two-dimensional representations in (Q 2 , x), (Q 2 , z), <lb/>and (Q 2 , p T ) for the future direct comparison with TSA results ex-<lb/>pected from the analysis of COMPASS DY data. Here, z and p T are <lb/>the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried by the observed <lb/>hadron and the transverse component of the hadron momentum, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>From the total amount of about 4 × 10 10 recorded events, we <lb/>accept only those that have a primary vertex inside the target <lb/>volume, a reconstructed incident and a reconstructed scattered <lb/>muon track, and at least one outgoing hadron track. In order to <lb/>equalise the beam flux through the target, it is required that ex-<lb/>trapolated beam trajectories cross all three target cells. The deep-<lb/>inelastic scattering (DIS) regime is ensured by selecting events <lb/>with Q 2 &gt; 1 (GeV/c) 2 and excluding the region of exclusive nu-<lb/>cleon resonance production by constraining the invariant mass of <lb/>the hadronic system to be W &gt; <lb/>√ <lb/>10 GeV/c 2 (as also done at HER-<lb/>MES [11]). The restrictions on the fraction of the initial lepton <lb/>energy carried by the virtual photon, 0.1 &lt; y &lt; 0.9, remove events <lb/>with poorly reconstructed virtual-photon energy on the low side <lb/>and events with large electromagnetic radiative corrections on the <lb/>high side. After the application of these selection criteria about <lb/>16 × 10 7 DIS events are available for analysis. <lb/>While all above described requirements are imposed at the <lb/>event level, two more constraints are applied on the kinematic <lb/>variables of every detected charged hadron. First, p T &gt; 0.1 GeV/c <lb/>ensures a good resolution in the azimuthal angle φ h . Secondly, the <lb/>requirements z &gt; 0.1 or z &gt; 0.2 are alternatively used to select <lb/>hadrons produced in the current fragmentation region. The study <lb/>of these two choices is motivated by previous COMPASS results on <lb/>the Sivers effect [13]. <lb/>In the analysis presented here, we use reprocessed 2010 proton <lb/>data, which include improved detector calibrations and in particu-<lb/>lar better muon reconstruction efficiency. For the same kinematic <lb/>region, the resulting SIDIS yield is higher by about 9% compared to <lb/>the earlier analyses [13,29]. The two analyses give consistent re-<lb/>sults. For the present analysis, the four above defined Q 2 -ranges <lb/>are used. They contain 75%, 11%, 11% and 3% of the total statistics. <lb/>The two-dimensional (x, Q 2 ) distribution for charged-hadron <lb/>production at z &gt; 0.1 is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The dis-<lb/>tribution is normalised to have a maximum value equal to one. The <lb/>right panel shows the same distribution where each (x, Q 2 ) cell is <lb/>independently normalised in the same way. <lb/>All eight TSAs that appear in the SIDIS cross section for a po-<lb/>larised initial lepton [21,22] are extracted simultaneously together <lb/>with the corresponding correlation matrix using the extended un-<lb/>binned maximum likelihood estimator as described in Ref. [31]. <lb/>The lepton-polarisation-independent TSAs A <lb/>w(φ h ,φ S ) <lb/>U T <lb/>are defined as <lb/>amplitudes of the azimuthal modulation w(φ h , φ S ) divided by the <lb/>spin and azimuth-independent part of the SIDIS cross section, the <lb/>effective proton polarisation ( f • P T ) and the corresponding depo-<lb/>larisation factor. The lepton-polarisation-dependent TSAs A <lb/>w(φ h ,φ S ) <lb/>LT <lb/>are additionally divided by the beam polarisation. The subscript <lb/>(U ) L denotes (in)dependence on the lepton polarisation and T <lb/>denotes dependence on the target transverse spin. <lb/>The TSAs are extracted separately for hadrons of positive and <lb/>negative charge, where any detected hadron is counted in the anal-<lb/></body>

With the requirement z &gt; 0.1, about 43 × 10 6 positive and <lb/>about 34 × 10 6 negative hadrons are available for analysis, and for <lb/>z &gt; 0.2 the numbers are approximately two times smaller. All re-<lb/>sults presented in this article are obtained for the range z &gt; 0.1. <lb/>The numerical results for the three z-selections z &gt; 0.1, z &gt; 0.2 <lb/>and 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 are available on HepData [32]. <lb/>The TSAs are determined in each of the four Q 2 -ranges as func-<lb/>tions of the variables x, z or p T , with the following bin limits: <lb/>x: 0.003, 0.008, 0.014, 0.022, 0.035, 0.055, 0.1, 0.145, 0.215, 0.3, <lb/>0.55, 0.9 <lb/>z: 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 1.0 <lb/>p T : 0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 7.0 (in units of GeV/c). <lb/>The resulting TSAs are carefully studied for possible system-<lb/>atic biases. The largest systematic uncertainty is due to possible <lb/>residual acceptance variations within the data-taking sub-periods. <lb/>They are quantified by evaluating various types of false asym-<lb/>metries. The differences between physical and false asymmetries <lb/>are used to quantify the overall systematic point-to-point uncer-<lb/>tainties, which are evaluated to be about 0.5 times the statisti-<lb/>cal uncertainties. An additional normalisation uncertainty of 3% <lb/>originating from the uncertainties of target polarisation and dilu-<lb/>tion factor is not included in the error bands that represent the <lb/>systematic uncertainties shown in the figures. An additional 5% <lb/>scale uncertainty has to be added in quadrature for the lepton-<lb/>polarisation-dependent asymmetries. More details on analysis and <lb/>systematic studies can be found in Refs. [13,29] and in a forthcom-<lb/>ing article [33]. <lb/>4. Results and discussion <lb/>The eight TSAs that are extracted from COMPASS SIDIS data <lb/>in this analysis are shown in Fig. 2 in the four above defined <lb/>Q 2 -ranges, after averaging over all other kinematic dependences. <lb/>In particular, the Sivers TSA is determined with good statistical ac-<lb/>curacy in all four Q 2 -ranges. For positive hadrons its amplitude is <lb/>clearly positive in all four Q 2 -ranges, whereas for negative hadrons <lb/>it is compatible with zero in the lowest Q 2 -range and becomes <lb/>significantly positive in the other three. The other seven TSAs will <lb/>be discussed in detail in the forthcoming COMPASS article [33], <lb/>while here they are shown for completeness. The full set of in-<lb/>formation for all eight TSAs including correlation coefficients and <lb/>mean kinematic values is available on HepData [32]. <lb/>In Fig. 3, the Sivers TSAs for the three z-selections are shown <lb/>after averaging over all other kinematic dependences in each given <lb/>Q 2 -range. As can be seen from this figure, the choice z &gt; 0.1 max-<lb/>Fig. 3. Sivers asymmetry in the four Q 2 -ranges for positive (left) and negative <lb/>(right) hadron production for z &gt; 0.1, 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and z &gt; 0.2 ranges. Note that <lb/>the average x-values in these Q 2 -ranges are different, as can be seen from Fig. 1. <lb/>The abscissa positions of the points for z &gt; 0.1 (z &gt; 0.2) are slightly shifted to the <lb/>left (right) for better visibility. Error bars represent statistical uncertainties. System-<lb/>atic uncertainties are shown as bands at the bottom. <lb/>imises the significance of the asymmetry in the highest Q 2 -range <lb/>for both positive and negative hadrons and is hence best suited <lb/>for the determination of the sign of the Sivers TSA in SIDIS. The <lb/>increase of the Sivers TSA with Q 2 cannot be interpreted as a <lb/>Q 2 -dependence as the average x-values increase substantially from <lb/>one Q 2 -range to the next one, as can be seen in Fig. 1. <lb/>In Fig. 4, the Sivers TSAs A <lb/>sin(φ h −φ S ) <lb/>U T <lb/>for positive and negative <lb/>hadrons are shown as a function of x, z and p T in the four above <lb/>selected Q 2 -ranges. For positive hadrons, a positive Sivers TSA is <lb/>observed in the whole x-interval and in all four Q 2 -ranges (first <lb/>column). The Sivers asymmetry as a function of x appears to in-<lb/>crease up to x <lb/>0.2 in each of the Q 2 -ranges, followed by a <lb/>possible decrease at large x. The second and third columns indi-<lb/>cate an approximately linear dependence at low z and p T values. <lb/>Such a behaviour is supported by the existing phenomenological <lb/>parametrisations of the Sivers effect [19,20]. For negative hadrons, <lb/>the Sivers TSA is sizeably smaller and less prominent. At interme-<lb/>diate z (0.3 ÷ 0.6) and low Q 2 (first row) it appears to be negative. <lb/>For larger values of Q 2 , the Sivers TSA for negative hadrons tends <lb/>to grow and becomes positive (see also right panel of Fig. 3). <lb/>Fig. 5 shows the Q 2 -dependence of the Sivers asymmetry for <lb/>positive and negative hadrons in five selected bins of x. These <lb/>are the x-bins to which more than two Q 2 -ranges contribute. The <lb/>figure also shows the predictions from collinear (DGLAP) and TMD-<lb/>evolution, which are based on the best fit [25] of all published <lb/>HERMES [11] and COMPASS [12,13] measurements. A compari-<lb/>son of the points from the same x-bins but different Q 2 -ranges <lb/>shows no clear Q 2 -dependence of the Sivers TSAs within statisti-<lb/>cal accuracy. Also, the comparison of fits (not shown in the figure) <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 4. Sivers asymmetry for z &gt; 0.1 in the four Q 2 -ranges as a function of x, z and <lb/>p T , for positive and negative hadrons. The abscissa positions of the points for nega-<lb/>tive hadrons are slightly shifted to the right for better visibility. Error bars represent <lb/>statistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are shown as bands at the bottom. <lb/>performed with a linear decreasing function or a constant does not <lb/>yield a statistically significant conclusion, although there may be a <lb/>slight preference to the former dependence for positive hadrons. <lb/>For negative hadrons no clear trend is observed. <lb/>In contrast to the DGLAP evolution framework, the present TMD <lb/>evolution schemes predict a strong Q 2 -dependence both for po-<lb/>larised and unpolarised TMD PDFs at a given x in fixed-target <lb/>kinematics. Still, due to partial cancellation of evolution effects in <lb/>numerator and denominator of the asymmetry, the Sivers TSAs <lb/>themselves may exhibit only a weak Q 2 -dependence. Available <lb/>descriptions of the Sivers TSAs, which are based on parametrisa-<lb/>tions of the unpolarised and polarised TMDs, are driven mostly <lb/>by the one-dimensional data at low x and low Q 2 from HER-<lb/>MES and COMPASS, so that present phenomenological studies of <lb/>Q 2 -evolution are based on fits using the results of two separate <lb/>experiments. Present models predict for increasing Q 2 a slight <lb/>increase of the Sivers TSAs for DGLAP and a decrease for TMD <lb/>evolution. Based on these fits of one-dimensional data, various <lb/>TMD-evolution models predict different sizes for the DY Sivers TSA <lb/>in the high mass range, with values between 0.04 to 0.15 [24-27]. <lb/>Better constraints on Q 2 -evolution models of TMDs can be ex-<lb/>pected only from data that are simultaneously differential in x and <lb/>Q 2 , as the data presented in this Letter. <lb/>In Fig. 6, Sivers TSAs are shown for different Q 2 -ranges in bins <lb/>of z and p T . Note that the average x-values in different Q 2 -ranges <lb/>are increasing with Q 2 , as can be seen from Fig. 1. Particularly <lb/>interesting in Fig. 6 is the comparison of the Sivers TSAs for pos-<lb/>itive and negative hadrons at low z and low p T (top row). Here, <lb/>they have small statistical uncertainties and appear to be compat-<lb/>ible with one another. Moving towards larger values of z and p T , <lb/>the two TSAs start to differ. <lb/>Fig. 6 shows different levels of agreement between our two-<lb/>dimensional data and the predictions that are based on earlier fits <lb/>Fig. 5.

Systematic uncertainties <lb/>are shown as bands at the bottom. <lb/>of one-dimensional data [19,20]. At low values of z and p T , pre-<lb/>dictions and data agree within uncertainties. In particular, there <lb/>is agreement in the region 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 (top row, left panel), al-<lb/>though the corresponding parametrisations were based on a fit to <lb/>HERMES data in the range z &gt; 0.2 and W &gt; <lb/>√ <lb/>10 GeV/c 2 [11] and <lb/>COMPASS data in the range z &gt; 0.2 and W &gt; 5 GeV/c 2 [13,29]. This <lb/>suggests that at COMPASS kinematics factorisation appears to hold <lb/>already in the range of low-z and W &gt; <lb/>√ <lb/>10 GeV/c 2 . At higher val-<lb/>ues of z and p T , clear discrepancies are observed. In particular, at <lb/>highest z DGLAP curve for positive hadrons exhibits an apparent <lb/>artefact at about Q 2 ≈ 10 (GeV/c) 2 . It can be expected that new <lb/>fits including the two-dimensional Sivers TSAs presented in this <lb/>Letter will better constrain the models. <lb/></body>

The abscissa <lb/>positions of the points for negative hadrons are slightly shifted to the right for better visibility. The solid (dashed) curves represent the calculations based on TMD (DGLAP) <lb/>evolution for the Sivers TSAs [25,34]. Error bars represent statistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are shown as bands at the bottom. <lb/>5. Summary and conclusions <lb/>In this Letter, we present the results of SIDIS measurements of <lb/>the Sivers TSAs in four different Q 2 -ranges, chosen to be the same <lb/>as used in the ongoing analysis of COMPASS DY data. For the first <lb/>time, results are given in various two-dimensional (Q 2 , x), (Q 2 , z), <lb/>and (Q 2 , p T ) representations. For positively charged hadrons, the <lb/>mean Sivers asymmetry is positive for all four Q 2 ranges, while <lb/>for negatively charged ones it is consistent with zero in the lowest <lb/>and positive for the other three Q 2 -ranges. <lb/>The range Q 2 &gt; 16 (GeV/c) 2 is particularly well suited for the <lb/>future comparison of COMPASS results on the Sivers effect between <lb/>SIDIS and DY measurements. It is shown that the SIDIS measure-<lb/>ment of the Sivers TSA in this Q 2 -range yields a positive value <lb/>with an accuracy that will allow us to test the predicted change of <lb/>the sign of the Sivers TMD PDF when comparing it to the upcom-<lb/>ing results of the analysis of the COMPASS DY measurement in the <lb/>corresponding range of di-muon mass. <lb/>The Sivers TSA measured in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 agree <lb/>well with the theoretical predictions that are based on fits on HER-<lb/>MES and COMPASS data, which were obtained for z &gt; 0.2. This <lb/>suggests that at COMPASS kinematics factorisation appears to hold <lb/>already in the region z &gt; 0.1. <lb/>The observed Q 2 -dependence of the SIDIS Sivers TSA at given x <lb/>presently does not allow us to quantitatively distinguish between <lb/>the predictions for Q 2 -evolution obtained using TMD and collinear <lb/>approaches when fitting the existing one-dimensional data. Future <lb/>fits using the multi-dimensional data may improve the situation. <lb/>In this regard, the two-dimensional representations of COMPASS <lb/>SIDIS TSAs presented in this Letter are the best currently available <lb/>input from fixed-target experiments. <lb/></body>
