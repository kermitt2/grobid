However interventions could be used to expedite <lb/>birth if the risks of continuing the pregnancy are higher than intervening. It is known that the <lb/>risk of epilepsy in childhood is higher in infants exposed to perinatal compromise and there-<lb/>fore may be useful as a proxy for intrapartum compromise. The aim of this work is to quantify <lb/>the likelihood of children developing epilepsy based on their gestational age at birth (37-39 <lb/>weeks or �41 weeks). <lb/>Methods <lb/>The work is based on term infants born in Sweden between 1983 and 1993 (n = 1,030,168), <lb/>linked to data on disability pension, child mortality and in-patient epilepsy care. The refer-<lb/>ence group was defined as infants born at 39 or 40 completed weeks of gestation; compared <lb/>with infants born at early term (37/38 weeks) or late/post term (41 weeks or more). Primary <lb/>outcome was defined a-priori as a diagnosis of epilepsy before 20 years of age. Secondary <lb/>outcomes were childhood mortality (before five years of age), and registered for disability <lb/>pension before 20 years of age. Logistic regression models were used to assess any associ-<lb/>ation of the outcomes with gestational age at birth. <lb/>Findings <lb/>In the unadjusted results, infants born 7 or more days after their due date had higher risks of <lb/>epilepsy and disability pension than the reference group, but similar risks of child death. <lb/>Early term infants showed higher risks of epilepsy, disability pension and child death. After <lb/>adjustment for confounders, there remained a higher risk of epilepsy for both early term (OR <lb/>1�19 (1�11-1�29)) and late/post term infants (OR 1�13 (1�06-1�22)). <lb/>PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210181 December 31, 2018 <lb/>1 / 12 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>a1111111111 <lb/>OPEN ACCESS <lb/>Citation: Odd D, Glover Williams A, Winter C, <lb/>Draycott T (2018) Associations between early term <lb/>and late/post term infants and development of <lb/>epilepsy: A cohort study.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>While pregnant mothers report that the health of their unborn infant is the single biggest pri-<lb/>ority during labor and birth[1] the optimal time management of pregnancies that approach <lb/>their due date is debated[2] although recent work suggests that earlier induction is associated <lb/>with a reduction in cesarean birth with possible improvements for infant outcomes[3]. <lb/>Although prediction of which infants will become compromised around birth is poorly under-<lb/>stood[4], we have presented some work that shows that modelling of risk is feasible[5] and <lb/>that simple interventions can improve neonatal and maternal outcomes[6]. <lb/>While most infants are born at 39 or 40 weeks gestation; many are born shortly before or <lb/>after. There is now evidence that infants born at 37 and 38 weeks (Early Term) are at higher <lb/>risk of neurodevelopmental problems[7,8] but less evidence exists for those born after their <lb/>due date[9,10]. Infants who remain in-utero after their due date are exposed to increasing risk <lb/>of infection, late stillbirth and increased risks of complications, such as shoulder dystocia and <lb/>perinatal asphyxia[11], without obvious benefits to the infant. The current literature on late or <lb/>post term outcomes is based on short term observations and, like the effect of preterm birth, <lb/>the neurological impacts may be substantially greater in the long term[12], even for infants <lb/>without signs in the newborn period. In contrast to premature birth, delivery of infants beyond <lb/>their due date may reduce risk, for either the mother or the infant if an adverse outcome <lb/>looked likely. Induction of labour (IOL), appears to be beneficial in certain high risk groups <lb/>[13-16] but its place in late or post term management not yet clear[16,17]. The UK National <lb/>Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest a key research priority is to &quot;identify <lb/>babies at particularly high risk of morbidity and mortality who will benefit from induction and <lb/>therefore avoid induction for babies who do not need it&quot;[18], while the prediction of which <lb/>infants will become compromised around birth has been identified as a priority by the RCOG <lb/>[19] and the UK Department of Health[20]. <lb/>One important neurological condition, known to be associated with fetal compromise and <lb/>perinatal asphyxia is the development of later epilepsy[21] and risk may increase in a dose-<lb/>response pattern after even mild degrees of compromise at birth[22] without obvious brain <lb/>injury after birth. As such it may be represent a pragmatic outcome of perinatal brain injury <lb/>even in infants without evidence of widespread impairment after birth, and we hypothesized <lb/>a-priori that rates may be higher in infants born over one week early or late compared to those <lb/>infants born within 7 days of their due date. <lb/>The primary aim of this work was to (i) quantify the risks of birth at 37/38 week gestation <lb/>and at, or after 41 completed weeks of gestation, on the risk of later development of epilepsy, <lb/>with particular emphasis on those born late or post term (&gt;40 weeks); and (ii) to investigate if <lb/>specific sub-groups appear at significantly higher risk, that then may benefit from enhanced <lb/>surveillance or earlier birth. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and methods <lb/>The initial dataset was based on the Swedish Birth Register and contained information on <lb/>2,650,219 eligible infants born in Sweden between 1973-2012, at 37 weeks or more of gestation <lb/>without congenital abnormalities. Linkage to other datasets (see below) was only possible when <lb/>the mother was born between 1948 and 1973 (inclusive). In order to develop a population-based <lb/>cohort, with 20 years of follow-up data for the infants the main cohort is restricted to infants born <lb/>between 1983 and 1993, by mothers aged between 20 and 35 years of age at the time of delivery <lb/>(n = 1,049,497). For the main analyses, infants with missing data on a priori confounders <lb/>(n = 19,329 (1.2%)) were removed; leaving 1,030,168 children for the main analyses (S1 Fig). <lb/>Perinatal data was derived from the medical birth registry which provides data on 98% to <lb/>99% of births in Sweden and includes Apgar scores, as well as both neonatal and maternal <lb/>diagnoses (coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 8th, 9th and 10th revi-<lb/>sions)[23]. The method of gestational age assessment is not recorded. By using the Swedish <lb/>unique ID numbers record linkages were made to the Longitudinal Integration Database for <lb/>Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA) database (1990-2012) for educational <lb/>measures and occupational socio-economic data, the Register of the Social Insurance Office to <lb/>obtain data on diagnosis at attainment of disability pension (1980-2013) and the Inpatient <lb/>Care Register (1973-2013) for diagnosis of epilepsy (ICD codes 345, G40, G41). Personal ID <lb/>numbers were deleted before delivery to one of the collaborators (FR). Due to using anony-<lb/>mous registry data, informed consent was neither required nor possible to obtain. Ethical <lb/>approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of Stockholm (Ref: 2015/1279-31/2). <lb/>In view of the possible increased risks at both early term (37-38 weeks) and late or post <lb/>term (41+ weeks), the reference groups were defined as infants born at full term (39 or 40 com-<lb/>pleted weeks of gestation)[24]; and compared to infants born earlier or later. <lb/>The primary outcome was diagnosis of epilepsy before 20 years of age (derived from the <lb/>inpatient register) after birth seven, or more, days after the infants&apos; due date (the late or post <lb/>term group). Secondary outcomes were childhood mortality (before five years of age), and reg-<lb/>istered for disability pension before 20 years of age. The association with early term birth was <lb/>also derived. <lb/>Covariates were selected as presumed confounders a-priori, and categorised into three <lb/>groups: i) social (maternal age, maternal occupation, maternal education), ii) antenatal (infant <lb/>sex and primiparity), and ii) intrapartum and neonatal factors (maternal or infant infection, <lb/>birth weight (z-score), birth by caesarean section). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Initially, subjects with and without missing data were compared. The distribution of risk fac-<lb/>tors and potential confounders was investigated, according to their gestational age category at <lb/>birth (i.e. early term, full term (reference) and late or post term). In univariable analysis the <lb/>risk of epilepsy and the secondary outcomes was derived, split by each completed week of <lb/>gestation. <lb/>In the multivariable analyses, logistic regression models were used to assess any association <lb/>of the outcomes with gestational age at birth. Random effects models (using birth year and <lb/>maternal ID as the grouping variables) were used to correct for any trends in practice or diag-<lb/>nosis over the study period as per our previous work[25]. Adjustment for confounders was <lb/>performed by adding the variables described above to the models in blocks of common vari-<lb/>ables (social, antenatal, and then intrapartum and neonatal factors). Birthweight and maternal <lb/>age were assumed to be continuous variable and not grouped further beyond their initial units <lb/>(grams and years respectively). <lb/></body>

			<body>To investigate if specific sub-groups appear at significantly higher risk, the model was <lb/>repeated assessing if possible risk factors modified the association between gestational age at <lb/>birth and the development of epilepsy. Models had the risk actors added as interactive terms <lb/>and models were compared using the likelihood ratio test. Factors assessed were; maternal age <lb/>(above or below 30 years of age), low birth weight (&gt;2 standard deviations (SD) below the ges-<lb/>tational mean), multiple birth, sex, parity, caesarean section, and pre-eclampsia. <lb/>A number of sensitivity analyses were performed (using the same primary outcome): <lb/>1. To test if the risk of epilepsy increased or decreased as the pregnancy progressed beyond <lb/>the due date, the model was repeated using the number of weeks of birth the infant was <lb/>born after their due date as an ordinal variable. <lb/>2. Splitting the late and post term infants to give 4 exposure groups (37/38 weeks, 39/40 weeks <lb/>(Ref.), 41 weeks and 42 of more weeks of gestation). <lb/>3. We repeated the final analysis using the main analysis cohort (n = 1,030,168); but excluding <lb/>those infants with evidence of perinatal encephalopathy after birth (n = 356) or those born <lb/>at 45 weeks gestation (n = 776) <lb/>4. We repeated the final analysis based on all infants recorded in the Medical Birth Register at <lb/>37 weeks or more of gestation, without congenital abnormalities, born in Sweden between <lb/>1973-2012, and with data on exposure, confounders and outcome (epilepsy), irrespective of <lb/>the length of follow-up data available (n = 2,516,997). <lb/>5. The final analysis was repeated twice, using development of epilepsy between the age of 0 <lb/>and 9 years of age, and between 10 and 19 years of age, when compared to full term infants. <lb/>All analyses were conducted with Stata 14 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX), and <lb/>results are presented as number (percent), mean (SD), geometric mean (95% confidence inter-<lb/>val), or OR (95% confidence interval). <lb/>Role of the funding source <lb/>The funder had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation of the data, <lb/>writing of the report or decision to submit the paper for publication. <lb/>Results <lb/>A total of 1,030,168 infants were included in the main analyses, while 19,329 eligible infants <lb/>had insufficient data for inclusion. Infants excluded due to missing data differed from those <lb/>included in a number of ways (S1 Table). There was little evidence that infants with missing <lb/>data had different gestational ages or higher risks of epilepsy but they weighed less and had <lb/>younger, primiparous mothers. Maternal infection appeared less commonly in infants <lb/>excluded and both maternal occupation and educational status demonstrated a different pro-<lb/>file. Infants excluded appeared to have similar one minute Apgar scores, but slightly higher <lb/>five minute score, and similar risks of encephalopathy. <lb/>In total, 263,999 (25�6%) infants were born at 41 weeks gestation or later, while 207,633 <lb/>(20�2%) were born at 37 or 38 weeks (Table 1). Most demographics varied significantly by ges-<lb/>tational age group although absolute differences were small. The highest risk of pre-eclampsia <lb/>or birth by caesarean section did however appear to be in those infants born at 39 or 40 weeks <lb/>gestation, while primparous women appeared to be more likely to have late or post term <lb/>infants than the other two groups. In addition infants born earlier or later than the reference <lb/></body>

			<body>group had lower Apgar scores and a higher risk of encephalopathy consistent with our previ-<lb/>ous work[25]. A more detailed comparison is shown in S2 Table. <lb/>In the univariable analysis there was statistical evidence that risk of epilepsy, childhood <lb/>mortality, and rate of disability pension were associated with gestation at birth (Fig 1 and <lb/>Table 2, all comparisons p&lt;0�0001). The risk of epilepsy was lowest in infants born at 40 <lb/>weeks gestation (0�39%), and highest in infants at younger (e.g. 0�62% in infants born at 37 <lb/>weeks) and older (e.g. 0�53% in infants born at 42 weeks) gestations and a similar profile of <lb/>risk was seen in childhood mortality and disability pension risk (S3 Table). <lb/>In the unadjusted model, early term infants had higher risks of epilepsy (p&lt;0�0001), child-<lb/>hood death (p&lt;0�0001) and disability pension (p&lt;0�0001) than those born at 39-40 weeks&apos; <lb/>gestation (Table 3), and this association persisted, albeit slighted attenuated, in the adjusted <lb/>and fully adjusted analyses (epilepsy OR 1�19 (1�11-1�29), child death OR 1�42 (1�30-1�55), <lb/>disability pension OR 1�20 (1�16-1�24)).

In contrast, those infants born post term continued to dem-<lb/>onstrate clear evidence of an increased risk of epilepsy (OR 1.30 (1.17-1.45), p&lt;0.001) when <lb/>compared to full term infants. <lb/>Repeating the analysis using all infants recorded in the Medical Birth Register with available <lb/>perinatal data resulted in compatible results to the main analysis (Early term; OR 1�09 (1�07-<lb/>1�11), p&lt;0�0001; Late or Post Term OR 1�03 (1�02-1�05), p = 0.0001), as did repeating it after <lb/>exclusion of infants with known encephalopathy (Early term OR 1�20 (1�11-1�29), p&lt;0�0001; <lb/>late or post term OR 1�13 (1�06-1�22), p = 0�0005) and after excluding those infants born at 45 <lb/>weeks gestation (Early term OR 1.19 (1.11-1.29), p&lt;0.001; late or post term; OR 1.13 (1.06-<lb/>1.22), p&lt;0.001)). The relative risk of epilepsy in first ten years of life appeared to be compatible <lb/>with that seen in the second decade, for infants born at 37/38 weeks gestation (First 10 years; <lb/>OR 1.19 (1.06-1.33) vs Second 10 years; OR 1�20 (1�08-1�33)) and those born 41 of more <lb/>weeks ((First 10 years; OR 1�14 (1�02-1�02) vs Second 10 years; OR 1�14 (1�03-1�25))) when <lb/>compared to full term infants. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>In this work, we have identified an increased risk of epilepsy in infants born either Early or <lb/>Late/Post term, when compared to full term infants.

			<body>in short term measures (e.g. encephalopathy) and suggests a &apos;U&apos; shaped association with gesta-<lb/>tion around term; with the lowest risk being close to the infants&apos; due date and increasing for <lb/>both infants born before and after this point. A sensitivity analysis was consistent with a gradi-<lb/>ent of increased risk as the gestational age increased beyond the expected date of delivery, and <lb/>the association persisted after excluding infants in whom evidence of brain injury was evident <lb/>after birth and after adjustment for potential confounders. <lb/>The limitations of this work include the use of routinely collected data, and the presence of <lb/>missing data points. We defined epilepsy using the routine in-patient registry, although the <lb/>underlying cause (if known) for the seizures is not recorded: hence some uncertainty for the <lb/>biological mechanisms in play remains. We also did not have detailed information on the rea-<lb/>sons for birth, or the clinical steps made by the clinicians to minimise risk to these pregnant <lb/>women. However, the Swedish registries are considered robust sources of information and the <lb/>above effects are likely, if anything, to minimise any effect size rather than introduce false posi-<lb/>tive findings. In addition, measurement of gestational age in this cohort may be less accurate <lb/>than modern measures available to clinicians and may have changed gradually over the study <lb/>period. However, any error around gestational age measurement is likely to reduce power to <lb/>find an association (rather than introduce one) and a sensitivity analysis restricted to infants <lb/>with gestations less than 45 completed weeks reported comparable results to the main analysis. <lb/>We hypothesised that rates of epilepsy, a common consequence of more obvious brain <lb/>injury in the newborn period may be higher in infants born after 39 or 40 weeks gestation. <lb/>Indeed, while other work has shown increased risk of perinatal asphyxia in early and post term <lb/>infants[14,26,27], it seems possible that even mild levels of compromise may have measurable <lb/>impacts on cognition, movement and social metrics when compared to their peers[28-30]. <lb/>Recent work has suggested that the risk of epilepsy may also increase as a continuum after <lb/>compromise at birth[22], and the associations in this work also appeared to persist after <lb/>restriction to infants without obvious brain injury after birth. <lb/>The presumed causal pathways in play here are of great importance. The effects seen in <lb/>early term infants are consistent with other work suggesting even small degrees of prematurity <lb/>may have long term impacts[13]. These infants had higher risks of maternal disease (notably <lb/>pre-eclampsia and infection), as well as high rate of operative delivery compared to full term <lb/>infants. It would seem possible that some of the morbidity related to the infants is caused by <lb/>underlying disease process which leads to the delivery, rather than a consequence of it per se. <lb/>Consistent with this we did see some attenuation of the effect seen after adjustment for antena-<lb/>tal factors. However for these early term infants obvious intervention points are lacking and <lb/>causal pathways are less clear. <lb/>The associations seen in the late and post term infants, by contrast showed little attenuation <lb/>after adjustment, even after adjustment for intrapartum and neonatal factors (such as mode of <lb/>birth). It would seem plausible that deterioration of the in utero environment, along with other <lb/>consequences of late or post term birth (i.e. potentially a more difficult extraction) may con-<lb/>tribute to worse birth condition and long term consequences. In contrast to early term births, <lb/>enhanced surveillance, earlier induction or operative delivery may be options to minimize risk <lb/>in women and infants who go past their due date. A recent randomized trial has suggested that <lb/>induction as early as 39 weeks (compared to 40 weeks) is likely to reduce caesarean section <lb/>rates[3], data consistent with the introduction of a clinical care bundle in the UK (Saving <lb/>Babies&apos; Lives[31]). Importantly, neither study suggested impacts on neonatal morbidity <lb/>although the current Cochrane review[32] reports on 30 randomised trials of induction of <lb/>labour and concluded that further work was needed; particularly as no reviewed trial was able <lb/>to report on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Given the apparent safety of induction of labour <lb/>for the mother, this further highlights the results of this work; and it would seem prudent to <lb/></body>

			<body>discuss and/or offer induction of labour or at the least enhanced antenatal and intrapartum <lb/>care for all women whose pregnancy continues past their 39th or 40th week of gestation. We <lb/>also found little to suggest that the risks of epilepsy were modified by the clinical factors avail-<lb/>able to the clinicians (e.g. maternal age) with the exception of parity. This may simply be a <lb/>false positive finding, and any mechanism is unclear in this work; hence should be interpreted <lb/>cautiously. However increased stillbirth risks have been observed in primaparous post term <lb/>pregnancies[33] and validation using different cohorts and methodologies should be per-<lb/>formed. Previous work has suggested that preterm infants may demonstrate particularly high <lb/>risk of developing epilepsy, when compared to term infants, during the first few years of life <lb/>[34]. In this work we were unable to identify any change in the increased risk of epilepsy <lb/>between the first two decades of life for either the Early Term or Late/Post term infants. This <lb/>may reflect limited power to detect a real association, or that the casual pathways underlying <lb/>the associations differ between the two studies. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Infants born at early term (born at 37 or 38 weeks of completed gestation) appear to have <lb/>increased risk of epilepsy, childhood death and needing disability support. The causal routes <lb/>in this group are complex, and further work is needed to see if the impact appears to come <lb/>from the cause of the early birth or the impact of it per se. In addition we found that infants <lb/>born at 41 weeks gestation or more also appear to have increased risk of developing epilepsy as <lb/>they grow, and higher risks of needing disability support. For this group more work is needed <lb/>to identify if this association can be replicated, and if earlier birth may help prevent poor out-<lb/>comes; but in the meantime, these data could provide useful information to help women and <lb/>care givers make decisions with regard to the timing of induction of labour. It would also <lb/>appear prudent to offer enhanced surveillance to these women in order to minimise any <lb/>potential impact. <lb/></body>
