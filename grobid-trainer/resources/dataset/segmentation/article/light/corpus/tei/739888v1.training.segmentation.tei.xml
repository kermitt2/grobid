			<front>SUMMARY <lb/>Surveys of DNA sequence variation have shown that the level of genetic variability in a <lb/>genomic region is often strongly positively correlated with its rate of crossing over (CO) [1-<lb/>3]. This pattern is caused by selection acting on linked sites, which reduces genetic variability <lb/>and can also cause the frequency distribution of segregating variants to contain more rare <lb/>variants than expected without selection (skew). These effects of selection may involve the <lb/>spread of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps, SSWs), the elimination of deleterious <lb/>mutations (background selection, BGS) or both together, and are expected to be stronger with <lb/>lower rates of crossing over [1-3]. However, in a recent study of human populations, the <lb/>skew was reduced in the lowest CO regions compared with regions with somewhat higher <lb/>CO rates [4]. A similar pattern is seen in the population genomic studies of Drosophila <lb/>simulans described here. We propose an explanation for this paradoxical observation, and <lb/>validate it using computer simulations. This explanation is based on the finding that partially <lb/>recessive, linked deleterious mutations can increase rather than reduce neutral variability <lb/>when the product of the effective population size (Ne) and the selection coefficient against <lb/>homozygous carriers of mutations (s) is ≤ 1, i.e. there is associative overdominance (AOD) <lb/>rather than BGS [5]. We show that AOD can operate in a genomic region with a low rate of <lb/>CO, opening up a new perspective on how selection affects patterns of variability at linked <lb/>sites. <lb/></front>

			<body>Results and Discussion <lb/>Diversity Statistics in Relation to CO Rates in Drosophila simulans <lb/>The top two panels of Figure 1 show the relations between the rate of crossing over and mean <lb/>pairwise diversity at four-fold degenerate nucleotide sites (p4), for two populations of <lb/>Drosophila simulans. Consistent with previous studies of many species [1-3, 6], there is a <lb/>significant positive relation between CO rate and nucleotide site diversity for both X <lb/>chromosome (X) and autosomes (A). As reported previously [7], X has much lower diversity <lb/>than A for all bins of CO rates. Diversity is higher for the Madagascan than the Kenyan <lb/>population, consistent with the latter having been founded as a relatively small population by <lb/>flies descended from the putatively ancestral Madagascan population [7]. <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>The bottom panels of Figure 1 show the relations between CO rate and a measure of <lb/>the skew of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) towards rare variants, Dqw4 = 1 -p4 / qw4 , <lb/>where p4 and qw4 are the estimates of diversity based on the mean pairwise difference <lb/>between alleles [8] and the number of segregating sites [9], respectively. Other measures of <lb/>skew behave similarly (Supplemental Figure S1). As was also found in a Rwandan <lb/>population of D. melanogaster [10], there is much greater skew on X than A, although the <lb/>absolute level of skew for both X and A is much higher than in D. melanogaster, suggesting a <lb/>more intense recent population expansion in D. simulans. The skew is also larger in the <lb/>Madagascan than the Kenyan population, consistent with the latter having experienced a <lb/>bottleneck in population size or a slower rate of population expansion. The parameters of the <lb/>population expansion for the Madagascan population were estimated by [11]. <lb/>The most surprising feature of these results is that there is a nearly monotonic <lb/>increase of Dqw4 with CO rate in the autosomal CO regions. The overall autosomal values of <lb/>Dqw4 for non-CO regions are 0.22 and 0.13 for Madagascar and Kenya, respectively. A meta-<lb/>analysis of 10 independent autosomal non-CO regions from six Drosophila species <lb/>(Supplemental Table S1) gave a mean of 0.18, with s.e. 0.04. The pattern is more complex <lb/>for the X in D. simulans -there is a significant quadratic relation between Dqw4 and CO rate, <lb/>with an initial increase followed by a decrease at the highest CO rates. The non-CO regions <lb/>of the X show values of Dqw4 comparable to the CO regions, with the exception of the <lb/>telomere in the Madagascan population, which has a value of 0.44, possibly reflecting a <lb/>recent selective sweep, consistent with its very low p4 value. <lb/>If the skew in the SFS were in part caused by selective sweeps (SSWs), it would be <lb/>expected to decrease, not increase, with CO rate, as was found in computer simulations with <lb/>parameter values that are realistic for Drosophila [12]. If background selection (BGS) also <lb/>contributes, these simulation results showed that it should only produce a strong effect on <lb/>skew in the non-CO regions, and cause these to have higher skews than regions with CO. <lb/>Indeed, the simulations predicted higher skews in the non-CO regions than the observed <lb/>autosomal means presented above: Dqw4 was 0.24 for autosomal simulations with BGS and <lb/>SSWs, and 0.21 with BGS alone. Given that demographic effects probably contribute <lb/>substantially to the skew in the SFS in D. simulans, especially in Madagascar [11], an even <lb/>higher proportion of singletons in the non-CO regions is expected. <lb/>We will address elsewhere the question of relations between the level of skew of the <lb/>SFS towards low frequency variants and the CO rate outside the non-CO regions, and simply <lb/></body>

			<body>note that it probably reflects the joint effects of SSWs and population size changes, which <lb/>vary among genomic regions with different effective population sizes (Ne) associated with <lb/>different CO rates, so that low Ne can reduce the effect on skew of a recent population <lb/>expansion [10]. We focus here on the fact that the level of skew in the non-CO regions is <lb/>smaller than expected with BGS and/or SSWs. <lb/>Simulation Results and an Explanation for Low Skew <lb/>The simulations in [12] assumed a dominance coefficient (h) of 0.5 for deleterious mutations, <lb/>where the fitness of the heterozygous carriers of a deleterious mutation is reduced by hs <lb/>relative to wild-type, with homozygotes suffering a reduction of s. However, studies of the <lb/>effects of deleterious mutations on fitness components [13-15] suggest that there is likely to <lb/>be partial recessivity of most slightly deleterious mutations, with 0 &lt; h &lt; 0.5. Because <lb/>selection against rare deleterious mutations in randomly mating populations acts mainly on <lb/>their heterozygous carriers [16], the value of h does not greatly affect the fate of rare <lb/>deleterious mutations with similar values of hs, so that h = 0.5 was used previously for <lb/>convenience. <lb/>Empirical estimates of the parameters of the distribution of deleterious mutational <lb/>effects on fitness (DFE) in Drosophila suggest that it has a large standard deviation relative <lb/>to its mean [17-20]. Under a gamma distribution, the shape parameter for both <lb/>nonsynonymous (NS) and UTR mutations has been estimated to be approximately 0.3 [20]. <lb/>Such a wide distribution implies that there is a substantial proportion of selection coefficients <lb/>against mutant homozygotes (s) that have Ne s of the order of 1. For example, with h = 0.2, a <lb/>shape parameter of 0.3 and 2Ne s = 5000 (the value for NS sites in our simulations), the <lb/>proportion of mutations with 2Ne s ≤ 2.5 is 0.08. <lb/>This raises the possibility that a subset of partially recessive deleterious mutations <lb/>could cause associative overdominance (AOD), whereby loss of variability at neutral sites is <lb/>retarded by linkage disequilibrium (LD) between selected and linked neutral sites [21]. Such <lb/>LD causes a correlation in homozygosity between sites, so that homozygotes for variants at <lb/>the neutral sites are associated with reduced fitness compared to heterozygotes when <lb/>deleterious mutations have some degree of recessivity [5]. Recent theoretical work has <lb/>shown that partially recessive deleterious mutations can result in AOD when 2Nes is of the <lb/>order of 2.5 [5], given sufficiently close linkage between neutral and selected sites, which is <lb/>prevalent in low recombination genomic regions. By definition, AOD acts similarly to true <lb/></body>

			<body>overdominance, a form of balancing selection. Long-term balancing selection is known to <lb/>increase the lengths of the internal branches of coalescent trees relative to the total tree size <lb/>[22-25]; AOD should have a similar effect, causing the SFS to become biased towards more <lb/>frequent variants than with strict neutrality. BGS without AOD has the opposite effect, <lb/>especially in low CO regions where selective interference among deleterious mutations <lb/>increases the skew towards rare variants [12, 26-30]. <lb/>If the more abundant strongly selected mutations cause standard BGS effects in a low <lb/>recombination region, but some weakly selected mutations cause AOD, the net outcome for a <lb/>low CO region should be lower diversity and a site frequency spectrum (SFS) more skewed <lb/>towards low frequency variants than with no selection, but with higher diversity and less <lb/>skew than with standard BGS. This process could account for the relatively low skew <lb/>towards low frequency variants in the non-CO regions of humans [4] and six Drosophila <lb/>species (Supplemental Table S1). <lb/>We have investigated this possibility by simulations using a range of different <lb/>dominance coefficients (see STAR Methods for details). Figure 2A shows results with h = <lb/>0.2 and h = 0.5, for a range of CO rates that are all ≤ the mean rate of 2 x 10 -8 for female <lb/>meiosis in D. melanogaster [31, 32]. With deleterious mutations alone, advantageous <lb/>mutations alone, and with both deleterious and advantageous mutations, the mean value of <lb/>neutral diversity increases as the CO rate increases, whereas the degree of skew towards low <lb/>frequency variants decreases. In the presence of deleterious mutations, the degree of skew in <lb/>very low CO rate regions is substantially lower with h = 0.2 than h = 0.5, both in the presence <lb/>(0.16, 0.24) and absence of advantageous mutations (0.10, 0.21), and is not far from the <lb/>observed mean autosomal value across Drosophila species of 0.18. In addition, neutral <lb/>diversity with deleterious mutations is higher for h = 0.2 (0.0041) than h = 0.5 (0.0024) in <lb/>non-CO regions. Figure 2B shows the behaviour of a non-CO region with a range of <lb/>dominance coefficients, showing that low h greatly reduces the skew caused by BGS, and <lb/>increases diversity. As was found previously [12], BGS is the main cause of reduced <lb/>variability in the non-CO cases, reflecting the fact that the rate of sweeps is greatly reduced <lb/>by BGS when CO is absent. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AOD <lb/>(caused by the relatively small fraction of mutations that are weakly selected) reduces the <lb/>effect of BGS when mutations are partially recessive. <lb/>Linkage Disequilibrium Patterns and a Further Test for AOD <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>This hypothesis can be further tested by noting that that AOD increases the relative lengths of <lb/>internal branches of the coalescent tree for a neutral site (see above). By analogy with the <lb/>effects on LD of a recent population size change, this change in tree topology increases the <lb/>magnitude of LD [33, 34]. Conversely, BGS with low CO rates has the opposite effect, since <lb/>it increases the relative lengths of the external branches of coalescent trees, as noted above. <lb/>We can use the simulated values of neutral diversity to estimate the corresponding value of <lb/>Ne from the formula p = 4Neu, where u is the mutation rate per site) [35]. This can be used to <lb/>determine the approximate expected value of r 2 , the squared correlation coefficient between <lb/>the allelic states of pairs of neutral sites from equation (3) in [36]. As can be seen in Figure 3 <lb/>(top left), the simulation values of median r 2 for all pairs of neutral sites with deleterious <lb/>mutations and without CO (but with gene conversion) are more than an order of magnitude <lb/>lower than the neutral expectations, which are 0.200 with h = 0.2 and 0.209 with h = 0.5, <lb/>indicating a strong influence of BGS. Nonetheless, the magnitude of LD with h = 0.2 is much <lb/>greater than with h = 0.5 despite a higher level of diversity and hence Ne (note that low Ne is <lb/>expected to increase r 2 ). <lb/>The bottom panels of Figure 3 show plots of median r 2 for 4-fold sites against <lb/>physical location for 50 bins of distances between pairs of variants across genes on the non-<lb/>CO chromosome four in the Madagascan and Kenyan populations. As is expected from <lb/>bottleneck effects or a lower rate of population expansion, LD is markedly higher in Kenya <lb/>than Madagascar, but the overall levels of LD are of similar magnitude to the simulation <lb/>results, and are much lower than predicted from the estimates of Ne using p4 and the D. <lb/>melanogaster mutation rate [37]. There is an indication that there is a low level of crossing <lb/>over on this chromosome, from the significant negative relation between r 2 and distance <lb/>between pairs of sites, which is not observed in simulations with gene conversion alone. <lb/>It is, of course, possible that true balancing selection, rather than AOD, could <lb/>contribute to these patterns. Supplemental Figure S2 shows plots of 4-fold and 0-fold <lb/>diversities per gene along chromosome four, for the Madagascan and Kenya populations. <lb/>There is one gene, FBgn0268752, which stands out as having unusually high diversities at <lb/>both types of site in both populations. In the case of Madagascar, there are two intermediate-<lb/>frequency nonsynonymous variants (at positions 40149 and 40648) (Supplemental Table S2), <lb/>whereas Kenya is segregating for nonsynonymous variants only at 40648, possibly because <lb/>of loss of variability after a bottleneck. The polymorphisms at sites 40149 and 40648 in <lb/>Madagascar are not in LD with each other, whereas there are strong associations between one <lb/></body>

			<body>of the variants at 40149 and synonymous variants to its left (Supplemental Table S2). It is, <lb/>therefore, possible that there is balancing selection acting at this locus, which appears to be <lb/>unique to D. simulans. However, there is no evidence that the LD created by the 40149 <lb/>variant extends outside this locus, so that it does not contribute to the general patterns <lb/>described above. <lb/>Previous theoretical work on AOD due to deleterious, partially recessive mutations <lb/>suggested that it is likely only to occur in small populations, where there is indeed evidence <lb/>that the rate of loss of variability for molecular markers is slower than expected from the <lb/>neutral value of Ne [5]. This is because AOD requires Nes to be of the order of 1, which is <lb/>likely to be met by only a small minority of deleterious mutations in a large, randomly mating <lb/>population. However, when Ne for neutral sites is greatly reduced by selection at linked sites, <lb/>the extent of randomly generated LD between neutral and selected sites will be considerably <lb/>enhanced, and LD is the driving force for AOD [5]. <lb/>The simulation results shown in Figures 2 and 3 suggest that, with partially recessive <lb/>mutations and the wide distribution of s values suggested by population genomic analyses of <lb/>the effects of deleterious mutations, there is a noticeable effect of AOD on the SFS and extent <lb/>of LD at neutral sites when CO rates are very low. This interpretation can be tested by <lb/>comparing the results of simulations with a narrow versus wide range of selection <lb/>coefficients for deleterious mutations, keeping the mean constant (Figure 4). In this case, <lb/>diversity, skew and the magnitude of LD are independent of h; with the wide range of <lb/>selection coefficients, diversity and LD decrease with h, but skew increases. This is what is <lb/>expected if AOD is influencing the behaviour of neutral variants in low CO regions. <lb/>The properties of genomes or genomic regions with low rates of genetic <lb/>recombination are of considerable interest for a range of biological questions, including <lb/>evolution and variation in bacteria [38, 39], asexual higher organisms [40, 41], organisms <lb/>with high rates of self-fertilisation [42, 43], and Y and W chromosomes [44-47]. There is a <lb/>general expectation that genetic diversity and molecular signatures of adaptive evolution <lb/>should be greatly reduced in such systems, as a result of selection at linked sites. This <lb/>reduction in adaptation is important for understanding phenomena such as the degeneration <lb/>of Y chromosomes and the lack of evolutionary success of asexual and highly selfing species. <lb/>However, comparisons between different species with different modes of <lb/>reproduction that influence the recombination rate are often made difficult by confounding <lb/>factors, such as differences in the extent of colonisation events involving population size <lb/></body>

			<body>bottlenecks [42, 43]. The use of comparisons among genomic regions with different <lb/>recombination rates largely removes this difficulty, and has revealed many of the expected <lb/>results [2, 3, 6]. Here, we have shown that an unexpected pattern emerging from such <lb/>comparisons suggests that the largely neglected process of associative overdominance may <lb/>influence patterns of variability when recombination rates are very low. Because it requires <lb/>partial recessivity of the fitness effects of deleterious mutations, and the opportunity for them <lb/>to be present in both heterozygous and homozygous states, it will only operate in diploid or <lb/>polyploid organisms with some degree of outbreeding. It will, therefore, not affect haploid, <lb/>asexual or highly selfing organisms, or effectively haploid chromosomes such as Y and W. <lb/>This suggests that we might expect to see differences in their patterns of variability compared <lb/>with the non-CO regions of outbreeding diploid species. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">STAR Methods <lb/>LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITY <lb/>Hannes Becher <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS <lb/>The results described in here are based on whole genome sequences of isofemale lines of D. <lb/>simulans, established from fertilized females collected in Kenya and Madagascar by William <lb/>Ballard. These were maintained in the laboratory of Peter Andolfatto for several generations, <lb/>and subsequently inbred by brother-sister mating in the Charlesworth laboratory. The details <lb/>of the breeding procedures and sequencing methods are described in [7]. <lb/>METHOD DETAILS <lb/>Sampling and sequencing <lb/>We downloaded raw read data in fastq format for 21 isofemale Madagascan genomes and 18 <lb/>Kenyan genomes from the European Nucleotide Archive (study accession numbers: <lb/>PRJEB7673; PRJNA215932), as in [7]. We mapped the reads to version 2.02 of the D. <lb/>simulans genome (FlyBase release 2017_04) [48] using BWA MEM [49], then sorted, <lb/>merged and marked duplicates on the resulting BAM files using Picard Tools version 2.8.3 <lb/>(https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). We called variants separately for each individual <lb/>line using the HaplotypeCaller tool from GATK version 3.7 [50] with the options -<lb/>emitRefConfidence, BP_RESOLUTION and -max-alternate-alleles 2, then made per-<lb/>chromosome VCF files for the whole population using the GATK v3.7 tools combineGVCFs <lb/>and genotypeGVCFs. All the scripts necessary for downloading the fastq files and calling <lb/>variants are available at https://github.com/benja-<lb/>mincjackson/dsim_variant_pipeline_ref_v2.02.git. We defined sites as 4-fold degenerate in <lb/>all transcripts using information from the gff format annotation of the D. simulans genome <lb/>v2.02 (available from ftp://ftp. <lb/>flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_simulans/dsim_r2.02_FB2017_04/ gff/dsim-all-<lb/>r2.02.gff.gz). <lb/>Data analyses <lb/>In the absence of a high-density genetic map for D. simulans, we used the mapping data of <lb/>[31] for D. melanogaster. As described in [10], the D. melanogaster crossing over (CO) rates <lb/></div>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">were smoothed by Loess regressions against the physical positions of markers in the genome. <lb/>Each D. simulans gene was assigned the CO rate per megabase in female meiosis of the <lb/>corresponding position in D. melanogaster, using an alignment of the genome sequences of <lb/>D. simulans (v2.02) and D. melanogaster (v5.57) [48]. Following [10], the absence of <lb/>recombinational exchange between homologous chromosomes in Drosophila males was <lb/>taken into account by multiplying the autosomal CO rates by one-half, and the X linked rates <lb/>by two-thirds. All CO rates presented below have been corrected in this way. <lb/>For genomic regions with non-zero CO rates, genes were grouped into ten equally-<lb/>sized bins. For the autosomes (A), there were approximately 730 genes per bin, and <lb/>approximately 180 genes per bin for the X chromosome (X). All D. simulans genes that were <lb/>aligned to D. melanogaster scaffold heterochromatin, or to regions defined as lacking CO in <lb/>[10], were excluded before binning. These non-CO genes were then binned by chromosome <lb/>(2: 86, 3: 54, X (tip): 23, X (centromere): 33), and were used for the analyses of the non-CO <lb/>regions described below. <lb/>Chromosome arm 3R, which contains a large inversion relative to D. melanogaster <lb/>[51], was excluded from our analyses. The genetic maps of the X chromosome appear to be <lb/>similar in the two species [52] so that we used the D. melanogaster CO rate estimates as a <lb/>proxy for those in D. simulans. For the analyses of chromosome 2 and 3L, the binning <lb/>procedure assumes the rank order of the CO rate of a gene to be related to its physical <lb/>position in the same way as in D. melanogaster, even though the absolute CO rates per <lb/>megabase differ between the species: D. simulans has higher CO rates, especially in the low <lb/>CO rate regions near the centromere and telomere [52]. Non-parametric rank correlations <lb/>were therefore used to assess statistical relationships between the summary statistics for the <lb/>autosomal polymorphism data and CO rates. <lb/>Levels of polymorphisms per gene were measured by estimates of mean pairwise <lb/>nucleotide site diversity (p) [8] and Watterson&apos;s theta (qw) [9] for fourfold and zero-fold <lb/>sites, distinguished here by subscripts 4 and 0. The extent of skew of the folded site <lb/>frequency spectra (SFS) at fourfold and zero-fold sites for a CO bin was assessed in various <lb/>ways: the proportion of singleton variants (PS), the mean value of Tajima&apos;s D statistic (DT) <lb/>across genes in a bin [53], and the relative difference between the mean values of qw4 and p <lb/>(Dqw4 = 1 -p /qw4) for the genes in a bin. This is related to the Dp statistic of [54], but has the <lb/>opposite sign and is not multiplied by Watterson&apos;s correction factor for sample size [9]. An <lb/>excess of rare variants over the equilibrium neutral expectation for mutation and drift under <lb/></div>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">the infinite sites model [35] is indicated by an excess of PS over the theoretical value of the <lb/>probability of observing derived variants present at frequencies of 1/n and 1 -1/n in a sample <lb/>of n alleles [9], by a negative value of DT, and by a positive value of Dqw. The last statistic <lb/>has the advantage of being independent of the sample size at mutation-drift equilibrium with <lb/>constant N e and is used in the figures presented in the text. Results for the other statistics are <lb/>shown in the Supplemental Figure S1. <lb/>LD was computed between pairs of 4-fold sites as the square of Pearson&apos;s correlation <lb/>coefficient, r, between the allelic states of the sites [55]. Pairs of sites were then grouped by <lb/>distance into bins of 10 kbp and the mean r 2 was computed for each bin, discarding bins over <lb/>5 x 10 5 bp apart, since these contained very few datapoints. <lb/>Simulations <lb/>Forwards-in-time simulations were carried out with SLiM v2.6 [56]. The values of the <lb/>deterministic parameters of mutation, selection and recombination were chosen on the basis <lb/>of estimates from D. melanogaster, as described by [12, 20]. For the simulations, these values <lb/>were multiplied by (1.33 x 10 6 )/N, where N is the number of diploid individuals used in the <lb/>simulations, to ensure that the products of N and these parameters correspond approximately <lb/>to the values for a real Drosophila population [12]; this rescaling should conserve the <lb/>properties of the evolutionary process, with some exceptions discussed in [12]. Population <lb/>sizes of 2500, 10000 and 25000 diploid individuals were simulated, with a 1:1 sex ratio. The <lb/>genome consisted of 69 intergenic regions of 4 kb each, and 70 genes plus 4kb of non-coding <lb/>sequence at both ends of the genome. Each gene was made up of a 5´ and a 3´ UTR of 190bp <lb/>and 280bp, respectively, and five coding exons of 300 bp separated by four 100bp introns, <lb/>resulting in a total gene length of 2370 bp and a total chromosome length of 449900bp. This <lb/>provides an approximate model of the Drosophila fourth chromosome, the best-studied non-<lb/>CO genomic region [57]. <lb/>A constant unscaled per-basepair mutation rate of 4.5 x 10 -9 was assumed. To speed <lb/>up the simulations, no mutations were allowed in the intergenic regions, but CO and gene <lb/>conversion were allowed at uniform rates over the whole region. Following [12], all intronic <lb/>mutations were neutral. For simulations that included both background selection (BGS) and <lb/>selective sweeps (SSWs), UTR mutations were either deleterious or beneficial, with a <lb/>probability of being beneficial of p u = 9.04 x 10 -4 (see Table 1). Coding regions were <lb/></div>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">assumed to consist of 30% 4-fold degenerate sites and 70% 0-fold sites. 30% of new <lb/>mutations were thus neutral; of the remainder, most were deleterious, with a probability of p a <lb/>= 2.21 x 10 -4 that a mutation at such a site was advantageous [12]. In addition, simulations <lb/>were run with SSWs only, or with BGS only. Some purely neutral simulations were also run <lb/>for the purpose of testing. For these configurations, the appropriate mutation types were <lb/>replaced by neutral ones. <lb/>Gamma distributions of selection coefficients were used for the deleterious mutations, <lb/>and exponential distributions for the beneficial mutations (see Methods Table 1). Since the <lb/>main question investigated here is the possibility of associative overdominance effects in <lb/>genomic regions with low CO rates, which requires partial recessivity of deleterious <lb/>mutations [5], we adjusted the scaled selection coefficients shown in Methods Table 1 by a <lb/>factor of 1/(2h) for runs with dominance coefficient h that differed from 0.5, in order to <lb/>maintain the same heterozygous fitness effects of mutations. In large, randomly mating <lb/>populations of the type used here, the fates of new mutations are largely determined by their <lb/>heterozygous fitness effects [16, 58]. The value of h should thus not greatly affect the rates of <lb/>fixation of deleterious and beneficial mutations, or their probability distributions at <lb/>segregating sites, provided that it is sufficiently far from zero. <lb/>Following [12], the standard CO rate in female meiosis was set to 2 x 10 -8 , and a <lb/>range of values below this, including no CO, was simulated. The rate of initiation of gene <lb/>conversion (GC) tracts in female meiosis was set to 4 x 10 -8 , double the observed rate for D. <lb/>melanogaster [32], to compensate for the fact that gene conversion in SLiM v2.6 assumes <lb/>that tracts are initiated in only one direction. The mean tract length was 440 bp, and <lb/>individual values were drawn from a geometric distribution. No recombination was allowed <lb/>in males, so that the evolutionarily effective autosomal recombination rate is half the <lb/>assigned rate. <lb/>The simulations were run for 35,000 (= 14N) generations and a sample of 20 genomes <lb/>was taken every N generations. The first 20,000 (= 8N) generations were treated as a burn-in <lb/>period, during which the population approached mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, except <lb/>for runs with zero crossing over, where equilibrium was approached very quickly because of <lb/>strong effects of selection at linked sites. A few simulations were carried out with larger <lb/>values of N (10,000 and 25,000) in the absence of crossing over. For these, we used the same <lb/>burn-in and run times, because the simulations reached equilibrium much sooner than with <lb/>crossing over. Summary statistics were calculated from the state of the population after the <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">simulation finished, and fixations of new mutations were recorded if they arose after the <lb/>burn-in period. <lb/>The large population sizes were used to check whether the rather strong selection <lb/>against deleterious mutations with a population size of 2,500 caused a very strong haplotype <lb/>structure in the absence of CO. This can occur because of the build-up of pseudo-<lb/>overdominance between complementary haplotypes of the type 1010… /0101… , where 1 <lb/>denotes the wild-type state at a site, and 0 denotes the mutant state [59-62]. However, there <lb/>were relatively small differences in outcomes for the different population sizes, and even the <lb/>smallest population size showed no evidence for such an effect (see Figure 3). <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS <lb/>For the analysis of the D. simulans population genetic statistics, genes were binned by <lb/>crossover rate (10 bins of approx. 730 genes for autosomes, 10 bins of approx. 180 genes for <lb/>the X chromosome) as detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Per-bin means, weighted by the <lb/>number of relevant sites per gene, were analysed with Spearman rank correlations for the <lb/>autosomes, and with least-squares regression models (containing a quadratic term) for the X. <lb/>Both methods were implemented in R. The p values reported are the overall values for the <lb/>rank correlations, and for the quadratic terms in the X models. <lb/>The confidence intervals for the empirical and simulated data were generated via <lb/>bootstrapping using the R package &quot;boot&quot;. For the empirical data, bootstrapping was carried <lb/>out on the level of genes per bin (see Table S1). All simulations were run with 20 replicates, <lb/>which provide the basis for bootstrapping. We report the 95% confidence intervals of the <lb/>mean based on 1000 bootstrap replicates. For analyses of linkage disequilibrium, we used the <lb/>same approach for the medians of the r 2 statistic described above. <lb/>The decay of linkage disequilibrium with pairwise distance between sites was <lb/>assessed using Mantel tests as implemented in the R package &quot;vegan&quot;. The value of the <lb/>Mantel statistic and the associated p-values are reported in the legend of figure 3. <lb/></div>
