			<body>The vast amounts of data generated by researchers in many scientific disciplines hold potential <lb/>discoveries extending beyond the work of those who created them. This is only possible if data can be <lb/>discovered, accessed and amenable to reuse. The bioCADDIE Project (Ohno-Machado et al., 2017), <lb/>which was funded by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge Program (BD2K) (Bourne et al., 2015) to create a <lb/>way for researchers to search across all types of biomedical data, recognized that access conditions are <lb/>an important part of data discovery. Researchers, when asked for cases for a data discovery index, <lb/>emphasized their need for information about the conditions and methods for retrieving datasets of <lb/>interest. Data accessibility continued to be a focus in work of the NIH Data Commons Pilot Phase <lb/>Consortium that followed BD2K. <lb/>The possibility of data reuse is related to the use conditions for the data, and the latter has a direct <lb/>impact on data privacy issues. An increasing number of research studies require data that may present <lb/>risks to privacy if they are not protected. Human subjects may be exposed to re-identification from their <lb/>genomes (Lippert et al., 2017), geographic locations (El Emam, Brown, &amp; AbdelMalik, 2009), or clinical <lb/>data (El Emam, Jonker, Arbuckle, &amp; Malin, 2011), and pieces of information that may be innocuous in <lb/>isolation can allow re-identification when combined, particularly when linked to other datasets. A wide <lb/>range of procedures and technologies are being deployed to allow researchers to analyze these data <lb/>while protecting rights of research subjects (Abowd &amp; Lane, 2004; Sweeney, Crosas, &amp; Bar-Sinai, 2015; <lb/>Arellano, Dai, Wang, Jiang, &amp; Ohno-Machado, 2018; Goroff, Polonetsky, &amp; Tene, 2018). Researchers are <lb/>aware that protecting confidential information imposes costs on them, and they want to know what to <lb/>expect when it comes to data access and reuse conditions. <lb/>This article describes elements in the Data Tags Suite (DATS) metadata schema (Sansone et al., 2017, <lb/>DATS 2018) designed to provide information ranging from data access to data use conditions and <lb/>consent information. The &quot;access and use&quot; metadata items in DATS are designed from the perspective <lb/>of a researcher who wants to find and re-use existing data. We focus on the authorization to use a <lb/>dataset, and we do not attempt to describe the rules used to classify data as confidential or the <lb/>characteristics of data that make them sensitive. We also do not examine technical aspects of <lb/>authentication, i.e., confirming the identity of the researcher. Since DATS was created for use in a data <lb/>discovery index, we emphasize the impact of data protection procedures on data users. However, these <lb/>procedures are part of a larger environment around patient privacy protection, and this article puts <lb/>DATS metadata into the context of the administrative, legal, and technical systems used to protect <lb/>confidential data. <lb/> Protecting Confidential Research Data <lb/>Data providers try to balance the benefits of facilitating access to existing research data with their <lb/>obligation to protect information provided by research subjects (Alter &amp; Gonzalez, 2018). Datasets vary <lb/>in the level of risk that subjects can be re-identified and in the amount of harm that subjects would <lb/>suffer if their confidential information became known. We also have a range of data protection <lb/>measures that differ both in their effectiveness and in the costs that they impose on researchers. The <lb/>most burdensome and costly types of data protection are normally for data that pose the greatest risks <lb/>to subjects (Kaye &amp; Hawkins, 2014; Sweeney, et al., 2015; Rubinstein &amp; Hartzog, 2016). <lb/></body>

			<body>Felix Ritchie (2005) proposed a framework for protecting confidential data that is known as the &quot;Five <lb/>Safes&quot;. <lb/>• Safe data: Modify the data to reduce the risk of re-identification of subjects. <lb/>• Safe projects: Review and approve designs of proposed research projects. <lb/>• Safe settings: Isolate the data in a secure physical location or by applying secure remote access <lb/>technologies. <lb/>• Safe people: Require legal agreements that commit researchers to protecting confidential <lb/>information. Train researchers in best practices. <lb/>• Safe outputs: Review analyses and other products before releasing them to researchers. <lb/>(Desai, Ritchie, &amp; Whelpton, 2016) <lb/>These headings describe a toolkit from which data administrators select a combination of measures <lb/>appropriate for the disclosure risks in a particular dataset (Broes, Lacombe, Verlinden, &amp; Huys, 2018). <lb/>For example, a national sample of health interviews may be released after data masking procedures <lb/>(&quot;safe data&quot;), such as &quot;top coding&quot; income into an open ended category to make very wealthy <lb/>individuals less identifiable. In contrast, health histories of patients with a specific disease in a limited <lb/>geographic area are much more difficult to de-identify. Patient records may be released for only <lb/>approved types of research (&quot;safe projects&quot;) through a secure remote access system (&quot;safe settings&quot;) <lb/>under a formal data use agreement (&quot;safe people&quot;). Additionally, some healthcare institutions only <lb/>permit release of analyses performed on their data after review (&quot;safe outputs&quot;). The challenge for a <lb/>data discovery index is capturing those aspects of the data protection that impose costs on prospective <lb/>data users, and potentially displaying only datasets that users may be authorized to use. The user should <lb/>be able to filter results according to his/her ability to conform to the authorization criteria. <lb/>DATS Access Metadata <lb/>The bioCADDIE Project invited an international group of advisors to participate in an Accessibility <lb/>Metadata for Datasets Working Group to recommend metadata describing how researchers gain access <lb/>to data. 2 This group identified three processes in accessing data for reuse: authorization, authentication, <lb/>and access method. <lb/>Authorization <lb/>Obtaining permission from the party that owns or is responsible for protecting the data is an important <lb/>step. A range of checks can be done for credentialing a user, which may take milliseconds or stretch into <lb/>weeks. Conditions for authorization are spelled out in data use agreements that are based on study <lb/>consent forms, HIPAA authorization forms, and other documents. Some data created for public use may <lb/></body>

			<body>not require any kind of permission (open access), but confidential data are protected by formal <lb/>authorization agreements, which are called &apos;licenses&apos; in DATS (see below). For example, the U.S. Health <lb/>Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines two standards for disclosing protected <lb/>health information: &quot;de-identification&quot; and development of &apos;limited data sets&apos; (U.S. Department of <lb/>Health and Human Services, 2000). &apos;Limited data sets&apos; are only available under a data use agreement, <lb/>because they contain information that increases the risk of re-identifying individuals. 3 The most <lb/>restrictive authorization procedures are designed to limit data access to &quot;safe people&quot; (controlled <lb/>access) who will respect the rights of research subjects and patients. Higher levels of security also come <lb/>with a price. Obtaining institutional signatures on legal agreements is burdensome and reduces re-use of <lb/>data (Joly, Dyke, Knoppers, &amp; Pastinen, 2016; Kaye &amp; Hawkins, 2014). For electronic health record data, <lb/>researchers are typically not the signatories of Data Use Agreements (DUAs): this is usually reserved for <lb/>institutions. Dyke et al. (2016) propose registration with self-declaration of qualifications, purpose, and <lb/>commitments as a level of protection between open access and authorization under formal agreements. <lb/>The Working Group identified six common types of authorization. <lb/>Authorization Types <lb/>None <lb/>Not covered by a data use agreement. <lb/>&quot;Click through&quot; online <lb/>license <lb/>Users must agree to an online agreement without providing additional <lb/>identification. <lb/>Registration <lb/>Users must register before access is allowed and agree to conditions of use. <lb/>Registration information may be verified. <lb/>Data use agreement <lb/>signed by an individual <lb/>An agreement signed by the investigator is required. Data use agreements <lb/>may require additional information, such as a research plan and an <lb/>Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. (See discussion of Licenses below.) <lb/>Data use agreement <lb/>signed by an <lb/>institution <lb/>An agreement signed by the investigator&apos;s institution is required. Data use <lb/>agreements may require additional information, such as a research plan and <lb/>an IRB review. (See discussion of Licenses below.) <lb/>Authorization procedures have implications for the accountability of the data user and timelines for <lb/>accessing the data. For example, if researchers want to remain anonymous they can only access datasets <lb/>labeled with Authorization Types &quot;None&quot; or &quot;Click through.&quot; If they are not affiliated with an institution, <lb/>they are not eligible for data use agreements covering many types of biomedical data. Conditions in the <lb/>DUA impose additional hurdles before the researcher will be able to use the data. Approval by an <lb/>institutional review board (IRB) is often required, and the researcher may need to show that the <lb/>purpose of the research is consistent with the consent forms signed by participants in the study. <lb/>Authorization is thus complicated, and a researcher may be allowed to use a particular dataset for one <lb/></body>

			<body>purpose (e.g., cancer research) but not another (e.g., a study on ancestry). (See the discussion of <lb/>Licenses below.) <lb/>A data repository may use one or more of these authorization types. The Inter-university Consortium for <lb/>Political and Social Research (2018), which is the oldest repository of social science data in the U.S., has <lb/>examples of all five authorization types among the studies in its collection. <lb/>Authentication <lb/>When data are accessed online, many data repositories require some kind of login process to identify <lb/>the user. Even when the data are not covered by a license, the user may need to create a username and <lb/>password for access (i.e., registered access). Access to confidential data may require multi-factor <lb/>authentication controls involving a second type of identification, such as a telephone number or <lb/>dedicated IP address. Researchers who plan to automate harvesting of data from multiple sources are <lb/>especially interested in authentication procedures. Three types of authentication were listed by the <lb/>Accessibility Metadata for Datasets Working Group. <lb/>Authentication types <lb/>None <lb/>No authentication required. <lb/>Simple login <lb/>Single factor login or the use of an authentication key or registered IP <lb/>address is required. <lb/>Multi-factor login <lb/>Multiple factor login using a combination of IP address, password <lb/>protection, authentication key, or other forms of authentication. <lb/>Access Method <lb/>Data repositories may protect confidential data by only allowing access in a physical or virtual &quot;safe <lb/>setting&quot;. Researchers who want to use highly sensitive data may need to travel to a secure &quot;enclave&quot;, <lb/>such as the Census Bureau&apos;s Research Data Centers (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018) and the Veterans Health <lb/>Administration VINCI system (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018), or submit program code to be <lb/>executed by the data repository (&quot;remote service&quot;) (Abowd &amp; Lane, 2004). A growing number of data <lb/>providers allow researchers &quot;remote access&quot; to computers in a secure data center, and this is the model <lb/>selected by the NIH-funded AllofUs Research Program (National Institutes of Health, 2017, p. 55). <lb/>Researchers working in these &quot;virtual data enclaves&quot; see a standard operating system, as they would on <lb/>their local computer, but they cannot download data to their local machine (Data Sharing for <lb/>Demographic Research, 2018; Research Data Assistance Center, 2016). They are a virtual machine <lb/>launched from their local computer but actually operating on the remote system. An example of this is <lb/>Vivli (Bierer, Li, Barnes, &amp; Sim, 2016), a new platform for sharing clinical research data, connects a data <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>repository to a secure cloud-based workspace. The &quot;Data Commons&quot; being developed by NIH will also <lb/>rely, at least in part, on a remote access system. When researchers are required to perform all of their <lb/>analyses on a computer controlled by the data provider, the provider also has the option of examining <lb/>and approving results before sending them to the researcher (&quot;safe outputs&quot;). <lb/>Access Method <lb/>Download <lb/>The data are available for download. A license may be required. <lb/>API <lb/>Interaction with the data may be automated via defined communication <lb/>protocols, i.e., Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs). <lb/>Remote access <lb/>Users may access the data in a secure remote environment (&quot;virtual data <lb/>enclave&quot;). Individual-level data may not be downloaded, only approved <lb/>results. <lb/>Remote service <lb/>A user may submit program code or the script for a software package to be <lb/>executed in a secure data center. The remote site returns outputs. It may <lb/>perform a review before releasing the results. <lb/>Enclave <lb/>Access is provided to approved users within a secure facility without remote <lb/>access. Results may remain at the enclave or be released after review. <lb/>DATS Use Metadata <lb/>A variety of terms are used to refer to legal agreements between data providers and users, including <lb/>&quot;data use agreement,&quot; &quot;data access agreement,&quot; &quot;material transfer agreement,&quot; and &quot;non-disclosure <lb/>agreement.&quot; In the &quot;open data&quot; world these agreements are called &quot;licenses.&quot; For example, Creative <lb/>Commons, which is best known for its copyright licenses, also provides licenses for data (Creative <lb/>Commons, 2018). However, &quot;license&quot; usually implies access to a commercial product (e.g., software) or <lb/>intellectual property (e.g., an invention), and we prefer &quot;data use agreement&quot; (DUA) for the agreements <lb/>between data providers and users, especially for confidential data. <lb/>Data use agreements are often lengthy agreements that inherit conditions from a number of earlier <lb/>documents involving several different parties (see Figure 1). DUAs include provisions describing allowed <lb/>uses, limitations, and requirements: what analyses can be conducted, how long the data may be used, <lb/>and the ways in which it must be returned, destroyed or discarded after use. DUAs typically require data <lb/>users to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from their home institutions, which may <lb/>impose additional conditions on the data user&apos;s research plan. The bioCADDIE project did not attempt to <lb/>create a comprehensive ontology of conditions found in data use agreements, but DATS has been <lb/>designed to take advantage of current efforts to use relevant ontologies when available. To understand <lb/>the metadata needed to describe an agreement for re-using data, we outline how these agreements are <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>created and administered. We focus here on the most complex case: agreements for data with some <lb/>risk of harm to research subjects or patients. <lb/>Most academic research involving human subjects requires prior approval of a research plan by an <lb/>ethical review committee or an IRB. In the U.S., federal regulations mandate IRB approval for all <lb/>research sponsored by NIH, NSF, and some other agencies (U.S. Department of Health and Human <lb/>Services, 2009), and most universities and other organizations require IRB review for all research <lb/>involving human subjects. IRBs are responsible for protecting human subjects from the risks posed by <lb/>research, which they do by approving and monitoring compliance with research plans. The research plan <lb/>will include a description of documents and procedures for obtaining informed consent from research <lb/>subjects involved in the study. The terms of the informed consent apply to all future research, and an <lb/>IRB should also review plans for sharing data resulting from the study. Researchers who analyze <lb/>confidential data from a data repository are also expected to obtain approval from an IRB at their <lb/>institution. However, IRBs do not make agreements with researchers at other institutions to share <lb/>confidential data. <lb/>Transactions involving confidential research data are conducted by officials who are authorized to make <lb/>agreements for the institution, such as a research administration officer. Most universities assert that <lb/>research data belong to the institution not to the researcher. If the research was sponsored by a funding <lb/>agency, the &apos;grantee&apos; is the university, and universities see ownership of data resulting from external <lb/>funding as part of their obligation to assure compliance with the terms of the grant or contract. Since <lb/>confidential data also pose a risk to the reputation of the institution and possibly legal liability, <lb/>universities are especially motivated to monitor the agreements surrounding them. This also applies to <lb/>the institutions of researchers who request confidential data, and many universities will not allow <lb/>faculty or staff to sign DUAs. Since data providers want the recipient university to be responsible for the <lb/>management of confidential data, data use agreements are typically signed by university officials on <lb/>both sides. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>Figure 1. The network of agreements from data collection to data sharing. <lb/>Data use agreements often include a variety of conditions that were not explicitly included in the <lb/>Informed Consent agreement. For example, some agreements include detailed requirements about <lb/>data storage and computer systems. Agreements may require data to be stored offline and isolated <lb/>from the Internet or be encrypted. Data recipients are often required to inform the data provider about <lb/>any publications resulting from their secondary research. In some cases, the data provider insists on <lb/>reviewing articles before they are submitted for publication or public presentation. Most data providers <lb/>require a research plan describing how the data will be used, which may be reviewed by a panel of <lb/>experts. For instance, researchers who ask for data from NIH&apos;s Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes <lb/>(dbGaP) repository must submit a Data Access Request for review by a Data Access Committee (Paltoo <lb/>et al., 2014; Shabani, Dove, Murtagh, Knoppers, &amp; Borry, 2017). The Data Access Request becomes part <lb/>of the Data Use Agreement and limits the recipient to the approved analyses. <lb/>&apos;Dynamic consent&apos; is a rapidly developing practice with important implications for data access (Budin-<lb/>Ljosne et al., 2017). Until recently, informed consent agreements were static documents signed by a <lb/>research subject when data were collected. There is a strong movement to give research subjects <lb/>ongoing control over the use of their data (Genetic Alliance, 2018). Subjects may be able to withdraw <lb/>consent at any time, and several new technologies allow them to choose which research projects can <lb/>use their data (Kim et al., 2017; Wilbanks &amp; Friend, 2016). Dynamic consent conforms to the spirit of the <lb/>European Union&apos;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but the GDPR exempts scientific research <lb/>from rules giving subjects control of their data (Chassang, 2017; European Union, 2016). This is for <lb/>research considered of &quot;substantial public interest&quot;, in which case consent is not required. If the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>research is not considered in the public interest, there are more demanding requirements entailing true <lb/>anonymization of the data or consent (Rumbold and Piersioneck 2017). <lb/>Private companies now hold enormous quantities of confidential data about their customers, which are <lb/>sometimes available to academic researchers under data use agreements. Kanous and Brock (2015) <lb/>found that agreements used by private data providers were often poorly designed. These agreements <lb/>were usually derived from non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements that were designed to protect <lb/>the business secrets of the data provider. Consequently, they are often vague about the nature of the <lb/>data and the uses permitted to the researcher. Kanous and Brock (2015) also found that some <lb/>agreements include conditions asserting the data provider&apos;s right to &apos;derivative&apos; works, which might be <lb/>interpreted to include analyses and publications. The Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project was <lb/>developed to provide independent scientific review of requests to use data created in the private sector <lb/>(Krumholz &amp; Waldstreicher, 2016). <lb/>The Accessibility Metadata for Datasets Working Group decided not to attempt to characterize the <lb/>conditions included in a data use agreements. Creating an ontology of use conditions was deemed <lb/>beyond the resources of the group. Fortunately, since the Working Group finished its report, a number <lb/>of efforts have moved in the direction of ontologies describing the conditions in data use agreements, <lb/>which will be detailed below. To accommodate this type of information, the most recent version of DATS <lb/>was extended with &apos;dataUseCondition&apos; and &apos;consentInformation&apos; schemas for referencing dedicated <lb/>ontologies in anticipation of their future implementation. <lb/>Conditions in Data Use Agreements <lb/>Data providers use agreements to assure that data users behave in ways that protect confidential <lb/>information and respect consent agreements with research subjects. For example, a common <lb/>requirement is that researchers will not attempt to re-identify subjects (&quot;safe people&quot;). Data use <lb/>agreements used by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) include lists <lb/>of statistics that should not be published, such as a cell in a cross-tabulation table describing only one <lb/>person, because of re-identification risks. Some agreements require data recipients to submit papers <lb/>and presentations for review before publication. Standardization of data use conditions would make it <lb/>easier to automate management and compliance with data use agreements, but the diversity and <lb/>specificity of legacy agreements makes classification very difficult. Fortunately, several projects are <lb/>working on this problem. <lb/>&quot;Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix&quot; (ADA-M) is an ambitious project of the Global Alliance for <lb/>Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) to <lb/>standardize metadata about data access (Woolley, 2017; Woolley et al., 2018). ADA-M divides <lb/>conditions into &quot;permissions&quot; and &quot;terms,&quot; which are arranged under specified concepts. Additional <lb/>information about permissions and terms can be provided with child fields, and free-text fields are used <lb/>to capture details and for human readability. <lb/>The Data Use Ontology (DUO), which is also a project of GA4GH, is formalizing a controlled vocabulary <lb/>used by dbGAP for conditions in data use agreements for genomic data (Dyke, Philippakis, et al., 2016). <lb/>DUO is based on the NIH Standard Data Use Limitation (DUL) codes (National Institutes of Health, 2015). <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>Data in dbGAP studies are arranged into &apos;consent groups&apos; that share consent agreements and other use <lb/>conditions. DULs are used to summarize these conditions, although consent groups are often subject to <lb/>additional conditions not described by DULs. DUL codes are composites combining several types of <lb/>conditions. For example, General Research Use (GRU) the broadest DUL code allows studies of <lb/>statistical methods and population structure or ancestral origin, but the Health/Medical/Biomedical <lb/>(HMB) code excludes those studies. Like the DUL codes, DUO allows a primary category (e.g., GRU) to <lb/>be modified by a secondary category (e.g., NMDS no general methods research). DUO has been <lb/>adopted by the European Genome-Phenome Archive (European Genome-Phenome Archive, 2018). <lb/>The Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) is being developed to represent logically terms and relations in <lb/>informed consent agreements (Lin et al., 2014; Manion et al., 2014). As the process of obtaining <lb/>informed consent moves from paper to online systems, it becomes possible to offer individual subjects a <lb/>wider range of choices about the future use of their data. <lb/>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), a recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium <lb/>(W3C) (Ianella et al 2018), provides a rich language to express statements about the usage of content <lb/>and services. It allows to provide a standard description model and format representing permission, <lb/>prohibition, and obligation statements. ODRL is recommended in the Data Catalog Vocabulary <lb/>(Gonzalez-Beltran et al 2018). <lb/>Other relevant vocabularies, which also follow a granular approach, are the Open Data Rights Statement <lb/>Vocabulary (Dodds 2013) and the Agreements ontology (AGR-O) (Car 2018). <lb/>These vocabularies provide more granularity than DUO and ICO. However, representing Data Use <lb/>Agreements or Data Use Limitations in a granular way distinguishing permissions, prohibitions and <lb/>obligations is a very challenging task, which becomes intractable in many cases, as the original <lb/>documents have not considered such detailed representation and there is ambiguity on choosing <lb/>relevant terms. <lb/>Thus, for cases where it is not feasible to distinguish between permissions, prohibitions and obligations, <lb/>DATS recommends the use of DUO and ICO. However, if an expression relying on ODRL, or ODRS, or the <lb/>Agreements ontology can be used, DATS support pointing to such expression. <lb/>The DATS &apos;ConsentInformation&apos; (consent_info_schema.json) 4 schema has been designed in a flexible <lb/>way to capture conditions limiting the use of a dataset that may not be included in the data use <lb/>agreement. First, as we noted above, the data use agreement implicitly inherits conditions from all of <lb/>the previous agreements and approvals covering the data. In particular, the informed consent <lb/>agreement may include requirements not listed explicitly in the data use agreement. For this reason, <lb/>the &apos;consentInformation&apos; schema includes an &apos;incorporatedIn&apos; property that points to the license that it <lb/>modifies (see Figure 2). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 2: a graphical representation of relevant constructs allowing consent, license and terms of use <lb/>information to be made available as information payload in DATS messages. The new <lb/>ConsentInformation schema allows for annotation (semantic markup) with resources such as the Data <lb/>Use Ontology (produced by the Global Alliance for Genomic Health) or the Information Consent <lb/>Ontology. <lb/>Second, a research study may include data from subjects who signed different consent agreements. An <lb/>important example of this regularly occurs in studies that collect genomic data from patients with a <lb/>specific disease. Some subjects provide consent only to research about their disease, while other <lb/>subjects allow their data to be used for any type of research. Restrictions of this kind are important to <lb/>researchers who are searching for data as well as collecting data for reuse (e.g., when creating synthetic <lb/>cohorts). DATS may be used to describe a specimen or data derived from a tissue sample of a specific <lb/>individual. To cover these cases the &apos;consentInformation&apos; property may be included in the DATS <lb/>&apos;material&apos; entity. <lb/>The following table shows the information in dbGAP for consent groups in the Massachusetts General <lb/>Hospital (MGH) Atrial Fibrillation Study. The first group (Health/Medical/Biomedical) gave their consent <lb/>for any type of health, medical, or biomedical research with the exception of studies about the origins or <lb/>ancestry of individuals or groups. The second group (Disease-Specific) only consented to future research <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>on atrial fibrillation, the focus of the original study. Both consent groups require IRB approval from the <lb/>recipient&apos;s institution. In these cases, DATS can describe multiple &quot;study groups&quot; with different consent <lb/>conditions and other attributes. In DATS, we would represent each consent group as a StudyGroup with <lb/>different &apos;consentInformation&apos;. <lb/>Consent group <lb/>Consent Information <lb/>Health/Medical/Biomedical <lb/>(IRB) <lb/>Use of this data is limited to health/medical/biomedical <lb/>purposes, does not include the study of population origins or <lb/>ancestry. Requestor must provide documentation of local IRB <lb/>approval. Use of the MGH AF Study data deposited in dbGaP is <lb/>restricted to research on associations between phenotypes <lb/>and genotypes. MGH AF Study data may not be used to <lb/>investigate individual participant genotypes, individual <lb/>pedigree structures, perceptions of racial/ethnic identity, non-<lb/>maternity/paternity, and of variables that could be considered <lb/>as stigmatizing an individual or group. All research must be <lb/>related to the etiology and prevention of morbidity and <lb/>mortality of the U.S. population consistent with the <lb/>demographic distribution in the MGH AF Study. Data users will <lb/>be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their <lb/>respective institutions (please note that only full or expedited <lb/>approvals will be accepted). <lb/>Disease-Specific (Atrial <lb/>Fibrillation, IRB, RD) <lb/>Use of the data must be related to Atrial Fibrillation and <lb/>related disorders. Requestor must provide documentation of <lb/>local IRB approval. Data use is limited to research related to <lb/>atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular disease. <lb/>Source: NHLBI TOPMed: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Atrial Fibrillation Study <lb/>dbGaP Study Accession: phs001062.v1.p1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-<lb/>bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001062.v3.p2 <lb/>Third, we expect that greater standardization and automation of informed consent agreements will lead <lb/>to the use of ontologies describing the conditions within these agreements. DATS has a standard way of <lb/>referring to external ontologies, which can be used for the standards being developed by projects like <lb/>ADA-M, DUO, and ICO. By including these conditions in DATS, we allow them to be used for discovery <lb/>and for filtering search results. Standardization will make it easier to provide this important information <lb/>to researchers. <lb/></body>

			<body>To record aspects of dynamic consent, the &apos;ConsentInformation&apos; schema also has a property for <lb/>&apos;temporalCoverage&apos;, allowing to indicate the periods of time when the consent is valid. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>There is an inherent tension between the growing importance of research that combines data from <lb/>multiple sources and the increasing demand for data that cannot be de-identified. Researchers cannot <lb/>plan their work unless they know how access will be provided and how long it will take to obtain the <lb/>necessary permissions. The access metadata objects in the DATS metadata standard differ from other <lb/>approaches in their focus on the experience of researchers who need to find and intend to re-use <lb/>existing data. DATS access metadata does not have the level of detail found in metadata standards <lb/>designed for managing data resources, like ADA-M (Woolley, et al., 2018), Fast Healthcare <lb/>Interoperability Resources (FHIR) (Health Level Seven International (HL7), 2018), or eXtensible Access <lb/>Control Markup Language (XACML) (OASIS TC, 2018), but references to other metadata standards can be <lb/>embedded in DATS. As these and other standards and ontologies develop, data discovery applications <lb/>will be able to benefit from them through DATS. <lb/>Based on the experience garnered through work on the DataMed prototype and the Data Commons <lb/>Pilot Project Consortium, we are convinced that dividing the access process into three steps <lb/>(authorization, authentication, and type of access) is a useful and original contribution of DATS. New <lb/>ways of implementing each of these steps are still emerging. Most discussions of data access distinguish <lb/>between &apos;open&apos; and &apos;restricted&apos; data, but &apos;restricted&apos; data are distributed in a growing number of <lb/>different ways. From a researcher&apos;s point of view data that can be downloaded are very different from <lb/>data that are only accessible on a remote virtual machine. As the bioCADDIE Project has drawn to a <lb/>close, we document our experience and encourage other organizations to take responsibility for <lb/>supporting and updating the controlled vocabularies identified by the Accessibility Metadata for <lb/>Datasets Working Group. <lb/>Capturing metadata about the conditions affecting data use will be a time consuming process until <lb/>standard ways of describing informed consent and data use agreements become part of automated <lb/>systems for creating and managing research data. There is little standardization in these agreements <lb/>today, and extracting and classifying the conditions included in legacy agreements is a very complex <lb/>task. When agreements have been described in standards like ICO, DUO, and ADA-M, they will be <lb/>searchable and discoverable in DATS. We expect that the benefits of automating these agreements will <lb/>be great, but it will take time to be realized. Since the technology for electronic health records is <lb/>developing very quickly, the automation of consent for research use of patient records and tissue <lb/>samples in FHIR or other standards may be close. <lb/>The most difficult problem is obtaining the cooperation of data providers in describing their access and <lb/>licensing procedures. This does not mean that all data providers must expose metadata about their <lb/>holdings in DATS. The bioCADDIE Project has demonstrated the flexibility of DATS by mapping and <lb/>ingesting metadata from more than 70 data repositories into DataMed (Chen et al., 2018). However, <lb/>the capabilities of data repositories vary widely. Major data repositories (e.g., dbGAP, Protein Data <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DRAFT 11 January 2019 <lb/></note>

			<body>Bank, ICPSR) have established metadata standards as well as the material and human resources to adapt <lb/>to new requirements. Other data repositories operate with minimal staff and under precarious funding, <lb/>even if they serve important scientific communities. We see a great need for NIH and other funding <lb/>agencies to adopt standards for data repositories, such as the CoreTrustSeal (CoreTrustSeal, 2018), and <lb/>develop new funding mechanisms designed to provide sustainable support for data curation, <lb/>dissemination, and preservation. As funding agencies put increased emphasis on FAIR (Findability, <lb/>Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) principles (Wilkinson, et al., 2016), access and data use <lb/>conditions should become findable as well. <lb/></body>
