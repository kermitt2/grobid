Muscle flexibility is a main component of health-related fitness and one <lb/>of the basic components of fitness for the performance in some sports. Sport and health <lb/>professionals require the flexibility profile of soccer to define quantitative aims in the <lb/>training of flexibility. The aim of this study was to identify age-related differences in <lb/>lower extremity flexibility in youth soccer players. <lb/>Methods. Seventy-two young male soccer players (age: 13.0 ± 3.1 y; body mass: <lb/>50.5 ± 15.3 kg; stature 158.2 ± 16.8 cm; BMI: 19.6 ± 2.6 kg/m 2 ) completed this <lb/>study. Measures of eleven passive hip (hip extension (HE), hip adduction with hip <lb/>flexed 90 • (HAD-HF90 • ), hip flexion with knee flexed (HF-KF) and extended (HF-KE), <lb/>hip abduction with hip neutral (HAB) and hip flexed 90 • (HAB-HF90 • ), hip external <lb/>(HER) and internal (HIR) rotation), knee (knee flexion (KF)) and ankle dorsiflexion <lb/>(ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed (ADF-KF) and extended (ADF-KE)) ranges of <lb/>motion (ROM) were taken. Descriptive statistics were calculated for hip, knee and ankle <lb/>ROM measured separately by leg (dominant and non-dominant) and age-group (U10, <lb/>U12, U14, U16 and U19). The data was analysed using a one-way analysis of variance <lb/>(ANOVA) to examine the interaction of 11 ROM in the different players&apos; age-group. <lb/>Results. Generally, U10 and/or U12 soccer players obtain the highest mean value in <lb/>almost all ROM evaluated (U10: HAD-HF [39.6 • <lb/>± 4.3 • ], ADF-KE [32.3 • <lb/>± 4.1 • ], <lb/>HER [63.5 • <lb/>± 5.6 • ] and HAB-HF90 • [64.1 • <lb/>± 7.5 • ]; U12: HE [17.7 • <lb/>± 6.2 • ], HAB <lb/>[35.6 • <lb/>± 3.0], HIR [60.8 • <lb/>± 4.7 • ] and KF [133.8 • <lb/>± 7.1 • ]). Nonetheless, significant <lb/>differences between the players&apos; age-groups are just found in HAD-HF90 • (p = .042; <lb/>ES = .136), HAB (p = .001; ES = .252), HIR (p = .001; ES = .251), HER (p &lt; .001; <lb/>ES = .321) and HAB-HF90 • (p &lt; .001; ES = .376) ROM, showing a progressive and <lb/>irregular decrease in these ROM until the U19 team. <lb/>Conclusion. The findings of this study reinforce the necessity of prescribing exercises <lb/>aimed at improving HAD-HF90 • ROM in U16, HAB ROM in U14, HIR ROM in U16 <lb/>and U19, HER ROM in U12 and U19, and HAB-HF90 • ROM in U16 and U19 players <lb/>within everyday soccer training routines. <lb/>Subjects Orthopedics, Pediatrics <lb/>Keywords Football, Range of motion, Adolescence, Stretching, Age-group <lb/>How to cite this article Cejudo A, Robles-Palazón FJ, Ayala F, De Ste Croix M, Ortega-Toro E, Santonja-Medina F, Sainz de Baranda P. <lb/>2019.

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Soccer is by far the world&apos;s most popular sport (Dvorak, Junge &amp; Graf-Baumann, 2004). <lb/>According to the survey conducted by the International Federation of Association Football <lb/>(FIFA) in 2006, more than 270 million participants played soccer in the world and most <lb/>of them were male players (90% of all registered players), with younger soccer players <lb/>comprising the greatest proportion (54.7%) (FIFA, 2006). <lb/>Soccer requires players to perform many repeated high intensity movements such as <lb/>sudden acceleration and deceleration, lots of changes of direction, jumping and landing <lb/>tasks, as well as many situations in which players are involved in tackling to keep or obtain <lb/>possession of the ball (Krustrup et al., 2010). Optimal performance in these actions depends <lb/>upon a variety of anthropometrical and physiological properties (Arnason et al., 2004; Pion <lb/>et al., 2015; Stolen et al., 2005). For example, body composition has been identified as <lb/>an important factor which could adjust the performance in soccer players across the <lb/>season due to the contribution that body fat and lean muscle mass have on some physical <lb/>abilities (Carling &amp; Orhant, 2010; Milanese et al., 2015). Likewise, some authors identified <lb/>endurance, repeated-sprint ability, velocity, agility and strength as the main properties and <lb/>optimal performance factors in this sport (Haugen, Tonnessen &amp; Seiler, 2013; Rebelo et al., <lb/>2014; Stolen et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2015). Nevertheless, it seems anthropometrical and <lb/>physiological demands are specific for each soccer player and depend on the participants&apos; <lb/>sex, position and age (Di Salvo et al., 2007; Le Gall et al., 2010; Oyón et al., 2016; Wong et <lb/>al., 2009). <lb/>Muscle flexibility is a main component of health-related fitness, and one of the basic <lb/>components of the performance in some sports (Kraemer &amp; Gómez, 2001); in soccer, <lb/>deficits in some ranges of motion might restrict specific technical skills and reduce players&apos; <lb/>performance (García-Pinillos et al., 2015; Mills et al., 2015; Nunome et al., 2006). Although <lb/>there is no consistent scientific evidence about the relationship between flexibility and <lb/>injury risk, it seems lower range of motion values in soccer players could also increase <lb/>the risk of some muscle injuries (Bradley &amp; Portas, 2007; Henderson, Barnes &amp; Portas, <lb/>2010; Witvrouw et al., 2003). In sport, it has been observed that flexibility is subject to <lb/>sex (Gómez-Landero, Vernetta &amp; López-Bedoya, 2013; Kibler &amp; Chandler, 2003), tactical <lb/>position (Oberg et al., 1984; Sporis et al., 2011), dominant laterality (Bittencourt et al., 2014; <lb/>Rahnama, Lees &amp; Bambaecichi, 2005) and competitive level (Rubini, Costa &amp; Gomes, 2007). <lb/>However, there are few articles where muscle flexibility was directly related to the age of <lb/>soccer players (Malina et al., 2007; Manning &amp; Hudson, 2009; Nikolaïdis, 2012; Vaeyens et <lb/>al., 2006). A general trend towards the flexibility reduction over ages has been reported by <lb/>previous studies conducted in non-athlete population (McKay et al., 2017). The knowledge <lb/>of flexibility changes in relation to the age of soccer players could show the variation of <lb/>this capability throughout the different phases of sport specialization, providing useful <lb/>information about the critical flexibility stages and the primary affected muscles to physical <lb/>trainers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify age-related differences in lower <lb/>extremity flexibility in young soccer players. <lb/></body>

The participants were recruited <lb/>from five different teams (U10 = 16 players; U12 = 15 players; U14 = 13 players; U16 = <lb/>15 players; U19 = 13 players) of a youth soccer academy (Table 1). All the participants <lb/>were outfield players and participated regularly in sport (3-4 training sessions and 1 <lb/>match per week). Also, none of the participants were involved in systematic and specific <lb/>stretching regimes in the last 6 months, apart from the 1-2 sets of 8-10 s of static stretches <lb/>designated for the major muscles of the lower extremities (e.g., hamstrings, quadriceps, <lb/>adductors and triceps surae) that were performed daily during their pre-exercise warm-up <lb/>and post-exercise cool down phases. <lb/>The exclusion criterion was history of orthopaedic problems to the knee, thigh, hip, or <lb/>lower back in the last 3 months due to the fact that residual symptoms could have an impact <lb/>in the habitual players&apos; movement competency and/or lower extremity ROM profile. The <lb/>study was conducted at the end of the preseason phase of the year 2016. The time frame of <lb/>the study was selected to make sure that the players recruited to each team were definitive <lb/>and stable within the testing period. <lb/>Before any participation, experimental procedures and potential risks were fully <lb/>explained to both parents and children in verbal and written form, and written informed <lb/>consent was obtained. The experimental procedures used in this study were in accordance <lb/>with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics and Scientific Committee <lb/>of the University of Murcia (Spain) (ID: 1551/2017). <lb/>Testing procedure <lb/>The passive hip extension (HE), hip adduction with hip flexed 90 • (HAD-HF90 • ), hip <lb/>flexion with knee flexed (HF-KF) and extended (HF-KE), hip abduction with hip neutral <lb/>(HAB) and hip flexed 90 • (HAB-HF90 • ), hip external (HER) and internal (HIR) rotation, <lb/>knee flexion (KF), ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed (ADF-KF) and extended (ADF-KE) <lb/>ROM of the dominant and non-dominant leg were assessed following the methodology <lb/>previously described (Cejudo et al., 2014a) (Fig. 1). <lb/>These tests were selected because they have been considered appropriate by American <lb/>Medical Organizations, American Academy of Orthopedic Association (1965) and American <lb/>Medical Association (Gerhardt, Cocchiarella &amp; Lea, 2002) and included in manuals of <lb/>sports medicine and science (Magee, 2002; Palmer &amp; Epler, 2002) based on reliability and <lb/></body>

In addition, the intra-operator <lb/>variability was analysed for each muscle flexibility measure using a test-retest design. <lb/>Before data collection, the reliability coefficient was evaluated on 20 healthy athletes. The <lb/>range of motion was measured twice with a 2-week interval. An interclass correlation <lb/>coefficient (ICC) and the minimal detectable change at 95% confidence interval (MDC 95 ) <lb/>were calculated from the results of subsequent measurements. Results of pre-and-post-<lb/>measurements showed a high reliability coefficient in all the tests (HF-KF [0.94], HF-KE <lb/>[0.97], HE [0.97], HAD-HF [0.97], HAB [0.95], HAB-HF90 • [0.96], HER [0.96], HIR <lb/>[0.96], KF [0.95], ADF-KE [0.95], and ADF-KF [0.95]). The MDC 95 for each flexibility <lb/>measure ranged from 3.7 • to 6.9 • (HF-KF [6.2 • ], HF-KE [6.1 • ], HE [3.7 • ], HAD-HF [5 • ], <lb/>HAB [5.5 • ], HAB-HF90 • [4.7 • ], HER [4.7 • ], HIR [4.1 • ], KF [6.9 • ], ADF-KE [4.7 • ], and <lb/>ADF-KF [5 • ]). <lb/>One week before the start of the study, all the soccer players completed a familiarization <lb/>session with the purpose of getting to know the correct technical execution of the <lb/>exploratory tests by means of the practical realization of each one of them. The dominant leg <lb/>was defined as the participant&apos;s preferred kicking leg. All tests were carried out by the same <lb/>two sport scientists (one conducted the tests and the other ensured proper testing position <lb/>of the participants throughout the assessment manoeuvre) under stable environmental <lb/>conditions. The sport scientists were blinded to the purpose of the study and to the test <lb/>results from previous testing sessions. <lb/>Prior to the testing session, all participants performed the dynamic warm-up designed by <lb/>Taylor et al. (2009). The overall duration of the entire warm-up was approximately 20 min. <lb/></body>

			<body>A 3-5 min rest interval between the end of the warm-up and beginning of the ROM <lb/>assessment was given to the soccer players because in a pilot study with 10 participants of <lb/>similar age and training status, sometime was required for practical reasons, like rehydrating <lb/>and drying their sweat prior to the ROM assessment. More importantly, it has been shown <lb/>that the effects elicited by the dynamic warm-up on muscle properties might last more <lb/>than 5 min (Ayala et al., 2016) and hence, decreases in ROM values within the 3-5 min <lb/>rest interval were not expected. <lb/>After the warm-up, soccer players were instructed to perform, in a randomised order, <lb/>two maximal trials of each ROM test for each leg, and the mean score for each test was used <lb/>in the analysis. Soccer players were examined wearing sports clothes and without shoes. A <lb/>30s rest was given between trials, legs and tests. <lb/>For the measurement, an ISOMED Unilevel inclinometer (Portland, Oregon) was used <lb/>with an extendable telescopic rod (Gerhardt, Cocchiarella &amp; Lea, 2002), a metal goniometer <lb/>with long arm (Baseline R Stainless) and &apos;&apos;lumbosant&apos;&apos; -lumbar support-to standardize the <lb/>lumbar curvature (Santonja, Ferrer &amp; Martínez, 1995; Sainz de Baranda et al., 2014). <lb/>Before each assessment session, the inclinometer was calibrated to 0 • with either the <lb/>vertical or horizontal axis. The angle between the longitudinal axis of the mobilized <lb/>segment was recorded (following its bisector) with the vertical or the horizontal (Cejudo et <lb/>al., 2014a; Gerhardt, Cocchiarella &amp; Lea, 2002). Regarding the assessment of hip abduction <lb/>movement, a metal goniometer of long arm (Baseline R Stainless) was used. <lb/>One or both of the following criteria determined the endpoint for each test: (a) an <lb/>examiner palpable or appreciated some compensation movement that increased the ROM <lb/>onset of pelvic rotation, and/or (b) the soccer player feeling a strong but tolerable stretch, <lb/>slightly before the occurrence of pain (Cejudo et al., 2014b). <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Prior to the statistical analysis, the distribution of raw data sets was checked using the <lb/>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and demonstrated that all data had a normal distribution <lb/>(p &gt; .05). Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations were calculated for <lb/>hip, knee and ankle ROM measurements, separately by leg (dominant and non-dominant). <lb/>Dependent sample t-tests were carried out to assess differences between the values of the <lb/>dominant and non-dominant sides. Also, data was analysed using a one-way analysis of <lb/>variance (ANOVA) to examine the interaction of 11 ROM at different youth teams. Post <lb/>hoc comparisons were made using the Bonferroni test for pair wise comparisons. Analysis <lb/>was completed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The effect sizes (ES) <lb/>of each variable were tested using eta squared (η2) between groups (.01 = small effect, .06 <lb/>= medium effect, and .14 = large effect (Cohen, 1988). Statistical significance was set at <lb/>p &lt; .05. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Statistical analysis reported no differences between dominant and non-dominant sides <lb/>for each ROM value, so the mean scores were used for comparing age-groups.

Generally, U10 and/or U12 soccer <lb/>players obtained the highest mean value in almost all ROM evaluated (HE, HAD-HF, <lb/>ADF-KE, HAB, HIR, HER, HAB-HF90 • and KF). Nonetheless, significant differences <lb/>between the players&apos; age-group (large effect) are only found in HAD-HF90 • (F 4,67 = 2.629; <lb/>p = .042; ES = .136), HAB (F 4,67 = 5.642; p = .001; ES = .252), HIR (F 4,67 = 5.624; p = .001; <lb/>ES = 0.251), HER (F 4,67 = 7.930; p &lt; .001; ES = .321) and HAB-HF90 • (F 4,67 = 10.074; <lb/>p &lt; .001; ES = .376) ROM, showing a progressive and irregular decrease in these ROM <lb/>until the U19 team. On the contrary, the greatest mean value in the HF-KE (F 4,67 = .847; <lb/>p = .501; ES = .048) and HF-KF (F 4,67 = 1.674; p = .166; ES = .091) ROM is observed in <lb/>U19 players, but these differences are not statistically significant. <lb/>U10 players report the highest values in HAD-HF90 • , HER and HAB-HF90 • ROM.

Finally, the Bonferroni post hoc test showed significant differences <lb/>in U14 vs. U10 (p = .011) and U14 vs. U19 (p = .021) in HAB, and U16 vs. U12 (p = .005) <lb/>and U16 vs. U19 (p = 0.01) soccer players in HER (Fig. 2). <lb/></body>

(A) HAB: hip abduction with hip <lb/>neutral test; (B) HAB-HF90 • : hip abduction with hip flexed 90 • test; (C) HER: hip external rotation test; <lb/>(D) HIR: hip internal rotation test; (E) HAD-HF90 • : hip adduction with hip flexed 90 • test. <lb/>Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.6236/fig-2 <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The purpose of the current study was to identify age-related differences in lower extremity <lb/>flexibility in young soccer players. The principal results of this research indicated that the <lb/>U10 and U12 soccer players had the highest values in several (HE, HAD-HF, ADF-KE, <lb/>HAB, HIR, HER, HAB-HF90 • and KF), but not all (HF-KE and HF-KF) of the ROM <lb/>assessed in comparison with their counterpart older players. <lb/>Flexibility seems to decline with age (Medeiros, Araújo &amp; Araújo, 2013). Johns &amp; <lb/>Wright (1962) determined that the relative contributions of soft tissue to total resistance <lb/>encountered at a joint are as follows: joint capsules, 47%; muscle and its fascia, 41%; <lb/>tendons and ligaments, 10%; and skin, 2%. Evidence suggests that biological changes such <lb/></body>

			<body>as tendon stiffening, joint capsule changes, or muscle changes could be responsible factors <lb/>for the age-related decrease in flexibility (Adams, O&apos;shea &amp; O&apos;shea, 1999). In this sense, <lb/>our data supports this statement showing a slight tendency to reduce the ROM during <lb/>different periods of soccer practice (specially in HE, HIR, HAB-HF90 • and HAD-HF90 • <lb/>ROM (Fig. 2)). A similar pattern in some of the hip ROM over the development phases <lb/>was previously reported by Manning &amp; Hudson (2009) who also found significant lower <lb/>ROM values in HE, HIR, HAB-HF90 • in senior soccer players compared to their equals&apos; <lb/>young players. The poor flexibility showed by older players in these ROM may also reflect <lb/>an adaptive response to playing soccer of soft tissue around the joints that improves <lb/>stability at the specific joint, or lack of attention to flexibility practices in training (Ostojić <lb/>&amp; Stojanović, 2007). Thus, training and repetition of specific soccer skills like kicking the <lb/>ball might explain the reduction of scores in HIR, HE and HAB-HF90o tests throughout <lb/>the different age-groups as a result of adaptation to this continuous contraction of external <lb/>hip rotator, hip flexor and hip adductor muscles. Indeed, these kicking adaptations would <lb/>be in agreement with the lower values found by López-Valenciano et al. (2019) in his recent <lb/>study in professional soccer players in HE (8.9 • ) and HIR (47.1 • ) ROM. Taking into <lb/>account that these reductions could predispose players to abnormal movement patterns <lb/>and increase the degeneration or capsular tightening in the hip joint (Manning &amp; Hudson, <lb/>2009), it is essential to perform stretching exercises aiming to improve the hip ROM. <lb/>On the contrary, older players have shown better values of ROM in HF-KF and, mainly, <lb/>in HF-KE. The HF-KE test assesses the flexibility of hamstring muscles. Some previous <lb/>studies have also shown similar increases in older soccer players&apos; hamstring flexibility in <lb/>comparison with their younger counterparts using the sit-and-reach test (Nikolaïdis, 2012; <lb/>Vaeyens et al., 2006). During the early childhood and adolescence ages the growth of bone <lb/>and muscle play important roles in force development, musculoskeletal loading and motor <lb/>control during childhood. Differential bone growth (femur) in relation to muscle length <lb/>can result in a decrease in flexibility (hamstring) and strength (De Ste Croix &amp; Korff, 2013). <lb/>In addition, these muscles have been the most studied muscle group by scientific literature, <lb/>given that they represent one of the most injured areas in sport, in general, and soccer, <lb/>in particular (Nogueira et al., 2017; Price et al., 2004). Several published injury prevention <lb/>programs include hamstring dynamic or static stretching exercises in order to increase <lb/>the flexibility in these muscles (DiStefano et al., 2009; Kiani et al., 2010). Perhaps, the great <lb/>incidence rates of hamstring injuries could explain an increase in the use of flexibility <lb/>training as a hamstring injury prevention strategy by the practitioners, allowing better <lb/>scores in HF-KE test in more trained athletes. Likewise, repetitive soccer skills as kicking <lb/>the ball where a hip flexion is performed accompanied by a knee almost full extended could <lb/>be a feasible reason to explain why older players present higher values in HF-KE ROM. <lb/>These adaptations in HF-KE ROM will be again in agreement with the results shown by <lb/>López-Valenciano et al. (2019) in professional soccer players (80.3 • HF-KE ROM). <lb/>Appropriate body status requires a minimum of flexibility to respond to the demands of <lb/>sport practise. Although there is no strong scientific evidence, flexibility appears to be also <lb/>necessary for sport performance in youth. In U16 soccer players, greater flexibility of the <lb/>lower back and upper thigh might discriminate players with high skill levels (Vaeyens et al., <lb/></body>

			<body>2006); in young soccer players with an age range from 14 to 18 year olds, hamstring flexibility <lb/>was established as a key factor for performing football-specific skills, such as sprinting, <lb/>jumping, agility, and kicking (García-Pinillos et al., 2015). The efficacy of the traditional <lb/>stretching techniques (such as static, dynamic, PNF or ballistic) in the improvement of <lb/>ROM results have been reported in several studies (Ayala, Sainz de Baranda &amp; Cejudo, <lb/>2012; Ayala, Sainz de Baranda &amp; De Ste Croix, 2012; Ayala et al., 2013; Sainz de Baranda &amp; <lb/>Ayala, 2010); by the same token, new protocols as the combination of traditional techniques <lb/>with electrical stimulation (Piqueras-Rodríguez, Palazón-Bru &amp; Gil-Guillén, 2016) have <lb/>shown important enhancements in the flexibility of soccer players with reduced ROM. <lb/>Therefore, the inclusion of sport-specific flexibility work in training routines could help to <lb/>increase the ROM values and to improve sport performance. The appropriate stretching <lb/>protocols and work-loads have to be selected by the practitioners to increase flexibility and <lb/>to maintain it throughout the distinct stages of youth physical development, following the <lb/>recommendations proposed by Lloyd &amp; Oliver (2012). Specially, these exercises should be <lb/>aimed at young players with limited ROM; so it is essential to evaluate athletes&apos; flexibility <lb/>profile. On this matter, new predictive mobile apps have been published to determine <lb/>boy soccer players with a higher muscle (hamstring) ROM restriction which can be used <lb/>to make a simple and quickly assessment of our soccer teams (Piqueras-Rodríguez et al., <lb/>2016). <lb/>However, it is unclear what level of flexibility is optimum to improve performance and <lb/>to prevent injuries in soccer. Optimal values may vary between muscle groups and different <lb/>sports (Ostojić &amp; Stojanović, 2007; Sainz de Baranda et al., 2015); while a swimmer needs <lb/>higher values in the shoulder and ankle ROM, a dancer requires huge values in almost <lb/>all (upper and lower extremity) ROM. Even within the same sport, the optimal values <lb/>depend on the demands of the players&apos; position and age; the goalkeeper will need distinct <lb/>upper extremity ROM than the field player, and the differences in the movement patterns <lb/>developed by children and adolescents will possibly require diverse degrees of ROM (as <lb/>it happens with knee angular velocity in kicking (Kellis &amp; Katis, 2007). The current study <lb/>intends to analyse the flexibility differences between young soccer players in relation to <lb/>their chronological age. Due to the lack of flexibility normative values in youth soccer, <lb/>the flexibility profile derived from our results could be used as minimum objective scores <lb/>to achieve in each age-group. Nonetheless, and having into account that soccer success <lb/>is based on many different variables (Nikolaidis et al., 2014), it is necessary to publish <lb/>prospective cohort studies adopting holistic approaches for predicting the exact cut off <lb/>score in each physical skill that implies a higher sport performance and lower injury risk. <lb/>One of the principal limitations of this research was the sample size used in each group <lb/>(U10, U12, U14, U16 and U19); the limited number of players in each of the youth academy <lb/>teams hinders the athletes&apos; involvement. Other limitation could be that neither index of <lb/>maturity nor player position was assessed within the study. Future studies should analyse <lb/>possible differences in flexibility in regard to players&apos; maturational status and tactical <lb/>position. <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>U10 and U12 soccer players display highest values in five of the ROM assessed (HAD-<lb/>HF90 • , HAB, HIR, HER, HAB-HF90 • ). On the contrary, older players (U19) showed <lb/>better ROM in HF-KE and HF-KF tests in comparison with their younger peers. The <lb/>ROM reductions in internal and external hip rotation and hip adduction and abduction <lb/>movements throughout the studied ages could explain an adaptive response of the muscles <lb/>involved in playing soccer. The ROM restriction could predispose players to abnormal <lb/>movement patterns and increase the risk of future injuries in the joints involved. Thus, the <lb/>findings of this study reinforce the necessity of prescribing exercises aimed at improving <lb/>HAD-HF90 • ROM in U16, HAB ROM in U14, HIR ROM in U16 and U19, HER ROM <lb/>in U12 and U19, and HAB-HF90 • ROM in U16 and U19 players within everyday soccer <lb/>training routines. <lb/></body>
