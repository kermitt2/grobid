			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Despite renal replacement treatment, cardiovascular disease <lb/>is the prime cause of morbidity and mortality among end-<lb/>stage renal disease patients, leading to more than 50% of the <lb/>deaths in such patients (1). Structural and functional changes <lb/>such as increased intima-media thickness and decreased arte-<lb/>rial compliance are associated with a significant increase in <lb/>morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease (2). A carotid <lb/>intima-media thickness of &gt;0.09 cm and/or the presence of <lb/>discrete plaques are markers of generalized atherosclerosis and <lb/>have a positive graded association with cardiovascular risk <lb/>factors (3). Arterial compliance, an important vessel wall prop-<lb/>erty, reflects the buffering capacity of a vessel. A low arterial <lb/>compliance caused by arterial stiffening widens pulse pressure <lb/>amplitude by increasing systolic blood pressure and decreas-<lb/>ing diastolic blood pressure. Increased systolic blood pressure <lb/>induces left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas decreased dias-<lb/>tolic blood pressure impairs coronary blood flow. Wide pulse <lb/>pressure may be a major predictor of cardiac risk, especially <lb/>coronary mortality (4-6). <lb/>Recent prospective studies have demonstrated that arterial <lb/>stiffness and early wave reflections are independent predictors <lb/>of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in end-stage renal <lb/>disease patients and in the general population (7-11). Arterial <lb/>wall properties in end-stage renal disease patients may be asso-<lb/>ciated with many factors including non-specific factors such <lb/>as age, gender, smoking, blood pressure and diabetes, as well <lb/>as alterations more specific to end-stage renal disease, such as <lb/>fluid overload, hyperphosphatemia, parathyroid hormone activ-<lb/>ity, microinflammation and alterations in blood lipids (12). <lb/>The aim of the present study was to identify the main fac-<lb/>tor affecting wall properties of the elastic common carotid <lb/>artery in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Study subjects <lb/>We enrolled 20 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <lb/>patients and 20 healthy, normotensive, age-and sex-matched <lb/>controls.

Increased intima-media thickness and decreased arterial <lb/>compliance are associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. This study <lb/>included 20 patients and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The <lb/>compliance and intima-media thickness of the right common carotid artery within 1 cm <lb/>to the bifurcation were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode echocar-<lb/>diography. Blood samples were obtained to measure levels of hemoglobin, phospho-<lb/>rus, total calcium, total CO2, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, serum total choles-<lb/>terol, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We found that the compliance of <lb/>common carotid artery was lower in the patient group than in the control group. In <lb/>the patient group, the compliance of common carotid artery was positively correlated <lb/>with serum albumin concentration, and intima-media thickness of common carotid <lb/>artery was negatively correlated with serum albumin levels. Stepwise regression <lb/>analysis showed that serum albumin concentration was independently related to <lb/>the compliance of common carotid artery, suggesting hypoalbuminemia can inde-<lb/>pendently give deleterious effects on the arterial wall in continuous ambulatory peri-<lb/>toneal dialysis patients. <lb/>Key Words : Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Artery; Compliance; Albumins <lb/>Received : 29 July 2004 <lb/>Accepted : 30 August 2004 <lb/></front>

			<body>age of 53.9±12.4 yr and a mean time undergoing continu-<lb/>ous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis of 16 months (range: 4-120 <lb/>months). <lb/>Individuals with the following medical conditions were ex-<lb/>cluded; cardiac failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] <lb/>class II and higher), unstable angina pectoris (NYHA class <lb/>II and higher), peripheral vascular disease, peripheral pitting <lb/>edema and pulmonary edema, above stage 3 hypertension <lb/>(systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pres-<lb/>sure &gt;110 mmHg), severe malnutrition (serum albumin &lt;2.5 <lb/>gm/dL), established infection and high-sensitivity C-reactive <lb/>protein levels &gt;5 mg/L, intact parathyroid hormone levels <lb/>&gt;200 pg/mL, serum total calcium levels &gt;11 mg/dL, and <lb/>serum phosphate levels &gt;7 mg/dL. In 11 patients the primary <lb/>kidney disease was associated with diabetes mellitus, while <lb/>in 9 patients it was not diabetes-related. <lb/>Methods <lb/>We compared arterial wall properties of controls and pati-<lb/>ents. After 15 min of supine rest, the compliance and intima-<lb/>media thickness of the right common carotid artery within <lb/>1 cm to the bifurcation were measured three times using a <lb/>high-resolution B-mode 7.5-MHz transducer. Patients were <lb/>asked not to smoke, eat or drink for 4 hr before measurements <lb/>were performed, but were allowed to take their regular med-<lb/>ication. 11 of 20 patients were administered antihypertensive <lb/>drugs (calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, <lb/>alpha-blocker). None of the antihypertensives nor other vasoac-<lb/>tive drugs (calcium containing phosphorus binder, etc.) of the <lb/>patients were changed over 1 month. Blood pressure was mea-<lb/>sured 5 times consecutively in a sitting position using a con-<lb/>ventional sphygmomanometer by the same nurse on each <lb/>occasion. Mean arterial pressure was calculated using the fol-<lb/>lowing formula: (systolic blood pressure+2×diastolic blood <lb/>pressure)/3. Pulse pressure was calculated using the following <lb/>formula: systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure. <lb/>Intima-media thickness was defined as the distance from <lb/>the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface of the far wall <lb/>to the leading edge of the media-adventitia interface of the <lb/>far wall as validated by Pignoli et al. (13). <lb/>Arterial compliance was defined by the arterial volume <lb/>change per unit of pressure. Systolic and end-diastolic arterial <lb/>diameter were measured three times and the compliance of <lb/>the common carotid artery was calculated using the Hayoz <lb/>formula (14): <lb/>Arterial compliance (mm 2 /kPa)=( D× D)/2 P; where <lb/>D=arterial diameter (mm), D=changes in systolic and dias-<lb/>tolic arterial diameter, and P=pulse pressure. <lb/>Stroke volume was measured using 2-dimensional echocar-<lb/>diography. Stroke volume=left ventricular outflow tract area <lb/>×the systolic velocity integral; where left ventricular outflow <lb/>tract area= (D/2) 2 (D=LV diameter). <lb/>Baseline echocardiography was performed using a Hewlett-<lb/>Packard Sonos 100 device equipped with a 2.25-MHz probe, <lb/>allowing M-mode, 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler mea-<lb/>surements. Measurements were made according to the recom-<lb/>mendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (15). <lb/>Left ventricular mass was calculated according to the Penn <lb/>convection (16). Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as <lb/>a left ventricular mass index &gt;136 g/m 2 in men and &gt;110 <lb/>g/m 2 in women. <lb/>In the patient group, blood hemoglobin levels were deter-<lb/>mined using a Coulter-Genis (Coulter, CA, U.S.A.) machine. <lb/>Blood phosphorus, total calcium and total CO2 levels were <lb/>measured using a Hitachi 747 automatic analyzer, with nor-<lb/>mal values considered 1.9-4.4 mg/dL, 8.2-10.4 mg/dL and <lb/>22-28 mol/ L, respectively. Intact parathyroid hormone was <lb/>measured using a commercial immunoradiometric assay (Di-<lb/>agnostic products corporation, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.), with <lb/>the normal range considered 12-72 pg/mL. Serum albumin <lb/>was measured using a Hitachi 736-740 autoanalyzer (Hitachi <lb/>Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein <lb/>was measured using the N High Sensitivity CRP kit (Dade <lb/>Behring, Marburg, Germany) which has a lower limit of 0.15 <lb/>mg/L. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-choles-<lb/>terol and triglyceride levels were measured enzymatically using <lb/>a Hitachi 736-740 autoanalyzer. Analysis of the mean of the <lb/>previous three samples over the preceding 3-month period <lb/>was included. <lb/>To evaluate the total Kt/V urea index (Kt/V) in the patient <lb/>group, the sum of the 24 hr residual and dialytic urea clear-<lb/>ances were divided by the urea distribution volume which <lb/>was calculated using Watson&apos;s normogram. Residual renal <lb/>function was estimated using the mean values of residual urea <lb/>and creatinine clearances. <lb/>Variables <lb/>Control group <lb/>Patient group <lb/>Age (yr) <lb/>59.1±10.1 <lb/>53.9±12.4 <lb/>Men/Women (n) <lb/>10/10 <lb/>10/10 <lb/>DM/non-DM (n) <lb/>0/20 <lb/>11/9 <lb/>CAPD duration (mo) <lb/>0 <lb/>16 (4-45) <lb/>Total Kt/V urea <lb/>2.03±0.51 <lb/>Residual renal function (mL/min) <lb/>2.3 (1-5.6) <lb/>Serum albumin level (g/dL) <lb/>4.4±0.2 <lb/>3.6±0.6* <lb/>h-s CRP (mg/L) <lb/>0.50 (0.15-1.50) 2.40 (0.20-5.00)* <lb/>Serum calcium level (mg/dL) <lb/>9.0±1.1 <lb/>8.6±0.8* <lb/>Serum phosphorus level (mg/dL) <lb/>3.7±1.3 <lb/>5.0±1.9* <lb/>Ca×P product (mg/dL) <lb/>32.15±1.53 <lb/>42.45±15.67* <lb/>Total cholesterol level (mg/dL) <lb/>211±60 <lb/>191±39 <lb/>LDL-cholesterol level (mg/dL) <lb/>115±28 <lb/>111±31 <lb/>HDL-cholesterol level (mg/dL) <lb/>53±15 <lb/>44±9 <lb/>PTH level (pg/mL) <lb/>90.71±27.03 <lb/>Table 1.

Differences <lb/>were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>We found that for the control group, the common carotid <lb/>artery compliance was 0.268±0.127 mm 2 /kPa, which was <lb/>higher than that observed in the patient group, 0.163±0.082 <lb/>mm 2 /kPa (p=0.018) (Table 2). The intima-media thickness <lb/>of the common carotid artery was lower in the control group <lb/>(0.06±0.03 cm) than in the patient group (0.08±0.02 cm; <lb/>p=0.025). The control group left ventricular mass index (111.0 <lb/>±24.7 gm/m 2 ) was lower than that of the patient group <lb/>(174.0±54.8 gm/m 2 ; p=0.01) (Table 2). In the control group, <lb/>systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial <lb/>pressure and pulse pressure were 126±16 mmHg, 78±9 <lb/>mmHg, 94±11 mmHg and 48±9 mmHg respectively, <lb/>with each being lower than the corresponding pressure in the <lb/>patient group; 152±18 mmHg, 88±10 mmHg, 109±12 <lb/>mmHg and 63±13 mmHg, respectively (p=0.008, p=0.028, <lb/>p=0.031, p=0.015, respectively) (Table 2).

			<body>DISCUSSION <lb/>The present study showed that common carotid artery com-<lb/>pliance and intima-media thickness differed between normal <lb/>individuals and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <lb/>patients. In addition, the study revealed that in the patient <lb/>group, the compliance and the intima-media thickness were <lb/>related to the serum albumin level. <lb/>Our finding that arterial wall compliance was lower in the <lb/>patient group compared to controls is in agreement with the <lb/>findings of others (8, 12, 17), and there are probably multi-<lb/>ple factors which contribute to this reduced compliance in <lb/>renal patients (12). In the present study, we found that serum <lb/>albumin concentration was an independent factor in reduced <lb/>compliance of the common carotid artery. This finding is con-<lb/>sistent with recent data suggesting hypoalbuminemia may <lb/>represent a state of accelerated atherosclerosis in dialysis pati-<lb/>ents (18). It appears longitudinal studies are needed to con-<lb/>firm the nature of the association between albumin levels and <lb/>atherosclerosis, and to elucidate the role of inflammation in <lb/>that association (18). <lb/>Traditionally, low albumin levels were believed to be the <lb/>result of inflammation, and there is evidence that atheroscle-<lb/>rosis is an inflammatory process (19, 20). In the dialysis pop-<lb/>ulation, there is increasing evidence of a link between inflam-<lb/>mation, signified by elevated C-reactive protein or interleu-<lb/>kin-6 levels, and cardiovascular mortality (21, 22). Therefore, <lb/>it is possible that poor nutrition, serum albumin levels and <lb/>atherosclerosis could be interlinked by inflammation. How-<lb/>ever, in contrast, a recent study (23) showed that protein mal-<lb/>nutrition (diagnosed based upon total body nitrogen levels) <lb/>and hypoalbuminemia were independently predictive of mor-<lb/>tality, whereas only hypoalbuminemia was predictive of vas-<lb/>cular morbidity. That study suggested hypoalbuminemia <lb/>itself was pathogenically associated with vascular disease, but <lb/>dissociated this effect from protein malnutrition (23). In the <lb/>present study, we excluded patients with severe malnutrition <lb/>and those with a level of established infection above the upper <lb/>level of that observed in normal controls. Our data revealed <lb/>no relationship between serum high sensitivity C-reactive <lb/>protein levels and common carotid artery compliance in the <lb/>patient group. This finding suggests that the serum albumin <lb/>level itself is related to changes in compliance and intima-<lb/>media thickness in the elastic common carotid artery. <lb/>Hypoalbuminemia may result in a hypercoagulable state <lb/>(24) and may deplete L-arginine stores with a subsequent <lb/>reduction in nitric oxide synthesis (24). Nitric oxide causes <lb/>equipotent relaxation of arterial smooth muscle (25) and in-<lb/>hibits platelet aggregation (26). In our stepwise regression <lb/>analysis, serum albumin levels were correlated with common <lb/>carotid artery compliance independent of age, blood pressure, <lb/>common carotid artery intima-media thickness, calcium and <lb/>phosphorus levels, lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reac-<lb/>tive protein levels. Furthermore, the common carotid artery <lb/>intima-media thickness was found to be inversely proportional <lb/>to serum albumin levels. These results suggest that in the <lb/>patient group, the wall properties of the common carotid artery <lb/>are linked to serum albumin concentration. <lb/>In the present study, although blood pressure in the patient <lb/>group was higher than in controls, there was no relationship <lb/>between blood pressure and compliance or intima-media thick-<lb/>ness of the common carotid artery. This finding that factors <lb/>other than blood pressure per se affect arterial wall compliance <lb/>is consistent with findings of the Tassin population study <lb/>showing that arterial compliance was lower in long-term nor-<lb/>motensive hemodialysis patients (27). <lb/>The design of the present study (cross-sectional) meant that <lb/>it was unable to address whether hypoalbuminemia itself <lb/>reflects vascular events and mortality in the patient group. <lb/>Therefore, to determine the relationship between serum albu-<lb/>min level and vascular events in the patient group, longitu-<lb/>dinal follow-up studies with addition of nutritional markers <lb/>are needed. In addition, future studies will ideally have larger <lb/>and more homogenous subject groups compared to the pre-<lb/>sent study. While the present study did not examine patient <lb/>volume status using reliable and objective methods, contin-<lb/>uous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients have relatively <lb/>stable volume status compared to hemodialysis patients, and <lb/>we excluded patients with peripheral pitting edema and pul-<lb/>monary edema. Therefore, we believe the results obtained in <lb/>this study were not influenced by patient volume status. <lb/>In conclusion, the present study showed that common ca-<lb/>rotid artery wall properties were independently associated with <lb/>serum albumin levels, suggesting that independent of other <lb/>factors, hypoalbuminemia can cause deleterious effects on arte-<lb/>rial wall properties in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dial-<lb/>ysis patients. <lb/></body>
